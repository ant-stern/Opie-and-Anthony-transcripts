<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

This Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock in the absence of Opie and Anthony, was a chaotic mix of planned segments and spontaneous outbursts.  The show opened with a two-part segment. The first featured Iron Sheik as a studio guest.  The Sheik recounted his past drug use (marijuana, opium, hashish, crack), discussed Chris Benoit's murder-suicide, and then urinated in his pants on-air, leading to much commentary about the smell and the resulting wet spot on the couch.

The second part of this opening segment focused on a major internal conflict involving Steve, a staff member.  E-Rock's repeated photographing of Steve's enormous breakfasts (cheeseburgers, fries, omelets) escalated into a shouting match. This highlighted apparent staff divisions ("Team Opie" vs. "Team Anthony"), with Steve feeling undervalued and isolated.  The discussion explored Steve's past weight issues and his anger, revealing a history of conflict with another staff member, Danny.  Steve's emotional outburst included accusations of bullying and threats, leaving the conflict unresolved.  A separate segment later in the broadcast delved deeper into the longstanding feud between Steve and Danny, which included a fist-raising incident from Steve and accusations of his unprofessional behavior.  Travis and Eric, other staff members, contributed to the discussion, highlighting a years-long history of disagreements and lack of communication, punctuated by frequent vulgar language and references to physical violence.  The hosts compared the dynamic to fictional scenarios like *Gulliver's Travels* and *No Country for Old Men*, referencing past show incidents like the "black girl body slam incident" and the "Ralphie May finger in the butthole incident," with Travis attempting mediation.  This segment also included a prank call to Leonard, a McDonald's employee celebrating 50 years of service, where the hosts falsely informed him of his termination, documenting his distress.  The prank call was followed by speculation about the ongoing tension between Steve and Danny and the future of the staff.  A later segment briefly revisited Leonard, recounting the prank and discussing a listener sighting of him at a bus stop.


Another segment featured the creation and debut of a new character, "The ONA Virus," played by a visibly upset and frustrated E-Rock, who was unprepared for the character's impromptu creation by Sam Roberts.  The Virus character attempted, with little success, to riff on news headlines involving David Letterman and Roman Polanski, leading to a forced and chaotic conclusion with the return of "Tank Hankerous" forcibly removing E-Rock from the studio.  The broadcast also included a studio interview with Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels, discussing a charity event and sharing career anecdotes. Osbourne offered particularly colorful commentary, including her opinions on Susan Boyle.

Finally, a segment focused on Perez Hilton's account of an alleged assault by Will.i.am's manager, Polo. Hilton described the incident, his calls to the police, and his use of Twitter.  The hosts and callers debated Hilton's actions, credibility, and the appropriateness of his online commentary, frequently using homophobic slurs.  Hilton's emotional response and Will.i.am's contradictory video statement were also discussed, amidst numerous interruptions, side conversations, and comedic tangents,  characterized by frequent use of vulgar language and homophobic slurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, this is Dana White, the president of the UFC, and you're listening to the worst  of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock. 
[00:00:30]  Yes, worst of Opie and Anthony, because O and A are on vacation, and they don't give us  the pay or the days off like Steve gets.  Why do you always throw Steve under a buzz?  This is Iron Sheik in studio.  Of course I had to pick the Iron Sheik.  This was a Primetime Sam Roberts booking, by the way.  A lot of people don't realize all the behind-the-scenes work I do.  It's amazing.  All the behind-the-scenes work I do, all the in-front-of-the-mic work I do.  I am that total package people are looking for.  That's Primetime Sam Roberts.  Yes, if it's wrestling or bad teen shows, it's Primetime Sam Roberts.  If it's good segments, it's Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[00:01:00]  No, we don't have any of those.  Excuse me.  Are you listening?  This doesn't involve you.  You booked them, but this doesn't involve you.  I booked it, and I helped bring it along, bring it along.  All right, whatever.  It's the Iron Sheik in studio, and he pisses all over himself.  He does.  You don't even need an out.  There it is.  No, there it is.  It's number 13 on the worst of 2009 calendar.  It's the worst of 2009.  Be our kind of guy.  He went through the six-pack in 45 minutes.  I'm not fussy.  Well, what's your favorite beer? 
[00:01:30]  A Canadian Morsenice.  Oh, that shit will fuck you up.  Exactly.  Because it's the strongest.  Six points.  Yes.  And a half or seven points.  That's it, but nice and smooth.  Yeah.  It doesn't make you get a big belly beer like him.  He don't drink beer.  Look at his guts.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter with him?  But if you did crack and you quit, and you quit crack, because you couldn't have been  a good crack addict if you still had that belt.  I mean, that's worth at least 10 vials. 
[00:02:00]  I didn't say I didn't do the crack.  I did the crack.  I did opium.  I did hashish.  I did Iranian marijuana and my Turkish hashish.  Iranian marijuana.  But moderation was my key.  Opium hash.  Remember that stuff?  Just a little bit of crack.  A little bit of crack.  I love crack.  Don't get me wrong.  If I can't afford it, I cannot afford it, I'll quit.  I hear you.  What a powerhouse.  Oh, you got it already?  Age is enough.  Jimmy's got it.  We'll explain it, man.  I had a party all my life. 
[00:02:30]  First, I do my marijuana.  I use a snore powder or a snore coke.  I get more energy.  I'm a more hyper.  I train three days.  That's what I'll do.  I train three days without a stop.  No sleep.  Oh, my God.  I still got three nights, three days.  That's crazy.  As long as I have my good medicine.  That's crazy.  But somebody, they cannot handle it.  After a couple cold years, after a little bit hard, a little bit soft, they're gone. 
[00:03:00]  But I'm absolutely broke.  Hey, did you watch the Hogan's reality show?  Did you like that show?  Or did you think it was just all crap?  I used to watch it?  I used to watch it a little bit, but at the end, it was nothing good.  A lot of the divorce, the wife, this, that.  Hulk Hogan can be a nice guy, or he can be the funniest, funniest faggot in the world.  Iron, I'm going to go serious for a moment.  I heard, and I'm not goofing on this, that you got really sad talking about Chris Benoit. 
[00:03:30]  I'll be honest with you, I saw him last time, Pennsylvania, and he come to me, he said,  I live faith in Georgia.  I said, I live faith in Georgia 45 years.  And he said, I'm alone, and I miss a friend, come see me.  I said, no problem. 
[00:04:00]  That was the last time I see Chris Benoit.  He's a Canadian, I'm Iranian, or American.  Whatever.  So, but Chris Benoit killed himself one thing, but he killed his baby, seven years old,  give the baby, shot a deco, and kill the baby, killed his wife, I don't think she did a good thing.  No, no, not a really good thing.  Do you know what I'm right?  Yeah, very bad, very bad, yes.  God bless you.  I think we could all look at that and say it was bad. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  That was very bad.  The man, if he had the balls, he wouldn't kill himself one thing.  But if he killed the little baby, seven years old.  That's crazy.  That's a little bit cheap heat.  Because that's a cheap heat.  See, I'll get my head in the ring before I do anything foolish.  I know it's still the show.  But Chris Benoit, young man, little guy, he want to be a big guy, like I don't know, sheik, he didn't make it.  That's right.  Well, I hear you.  Yeah.  Wow.  More Sergeant Slaughter in there. 
[00:05:00]  Wow.  We were just watching clips and then Iron Sheik.  Amazing.  I clicked on the wrong one.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Exactly.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Anthony, Opie, baby.  What a day.  Exactly.  Fantastic day.  And like I say again, I want to say hello to all my intelligent Opie and Anthony show, Howard  and Store 101 news.  And I want to say, everywhere I go in America, people tell me, Sheik, you are on the killer 
[00:05:30]  comedian, the best.  You are on the Howard and Store TV show, you are the best.  I think it's a great feeling for me.  To anywhere I go, people talk about it.  So, God bless all my wrestling fans and also Anthony and Opie and Anthony radio station.  God bless you guys.  I'm not going to talk no more and have a good day.  Iron Sheik, everyone.  Iron Sheik.  There he is. 
[00:06:00]  Go for the big out, Iron.  Go for the big out.  The Sheik.  Big out.  Amazing.  What a day.  Yeah, what a day.  This is fantastic.  We have to plug everybody, too.  Iron Sheik.  Yeah, let's go around the table.  Iron Sheik getting ready to leave the studio.  I want a picture with the Iron Sheik.  I got to get one, too.  Pleasure.  Go out of the hallway.  Pleasure for me.  I'll take the picture with you.  Yeah, can you go in the hall and start the picture taken?  Yeah.  Start the picture taken.  I want a picture with that guy for putting up with this.  Get him to cut a promo.  Get him to cut a quick promo for us. 
[00:06:30]  We can do that.  He has to be like it.  Take you.  Let me show you.  What?  Why?  What's bothering you?  Take you.  He's just a dog.  It has to be said that Aaron Sheik peed his pants.  Yeah.  Load the boots.  He had probably eight beers in less than an hour.  And there's a huge, there's a huge wet spot in the front of his pants. 
[00:07:00]  And he's putting his coat on.  It's an amazing wet spot in the front of his pants because he had eight beers in less than an hour.  And it's making believe he's doing something because he doesn't want to shake the Iron Sheik's hand.  Why don't you want to shake the Iron Sheik's hand?  He's a mere ten feet from us.  Because, because he, he pissed himself all, all over himself.  And I think it went on this, I think it's all over the couch. 
[00:07:30]  Dude, did you see this part getting bigger and bigger?  Yes.  There's my cat.  You have a vent.  Iron Sheik is not leaving the studio.  And the door is closed.  All right.  It's clear.  Get over there.  Get over there.  Dude.  I swear to you, I thought it was a shadow of the microphone at first.  Right.  Because I thought it was the mic bulb.  Sure.  And the light right above.  Yeah, with a lot of lights in here.  So I'm looking.  But at first I'm going, oh shit, I think the Sheik pissed his pants. 
[00:08:00]  And then, and then, uh, Iraq comes up and goes, the Sheik pissed himself.  And I go, wait a minute, I thought that was a shadow.  He goes, no, look, it's getting bigger.  And the wet spot in front of his pants was getting bigger and bigger.  Dude, he just pissed himself.  He pissed all over himself.  And now the room smells like piss.  Did you notice that too?  The whole room smells like piss.  And then the fucking, the couch is wet. 
[00:08:30]  Dude, the Iron Sheik pissed in our studio.  He pissed his pants.  Which makes it officially the best guest appearance ever on the Opie and Anthony show.  I think that is the biggest, best guest appearance ever.  Ending with a pissing of the pants.  Bill, take a seat, Bill Burr.  Do you know what we're talking about?  Do you know what we're talking about?  Do you notice anything about the Iron Sheik?  I didn't notice what happened there at the end.  Oh, that he had a bladder problem?  Yeah, there was a little.  Come on, dude.  You know, it's like the guy fucking, I'd get tossed around one day like that. 
[00:09:00]  I'd shit myself.  Yeah, but, Jesus Christ.  Can't you say I got off the eight beers in ten minutes?  First of all, I'm going to Tyson's right now.  In defense of us, we're all wearing jeans.  The man has on slacks.  There's no secrets when there's slacks.  I saw it growing.  I saw it as a drop.  And then I saw it manifest into a puddle.  It started growing like the swine flu map that we're seeing.  I thought it was like spilling his beer on it. 
[00:09:30]  That's what I thought, too.  But you notice when he talked, like, his whole diaphragm.  Jimmy has the best picture ever.  Was it sweat?  Look at Jimmy's picture.  Look at Jimmy's picture.  Oh, my God.  The poor son of a bitch.  Hold on.  The poor son of a bitch.  Oh, my God.  I can't make fun of the Iron Sheik.  Wait, I got to get my picture.  You guys continue.  No, dude, you guys, he wants a picture of both of you.  I can't.  I have stuff to do.  Rich, talk about it.  Oh, God damn it. 
[00:10:00]  Rich Foss just showed me a picture of his shit.  I did that.  Oh, Jesus.  You guys are weird, man.  You're just fucking weird people.  What?  You guys, I never showed one shit picture in my life, Billy.  Listen, the thing, you know what?  I know, but you look at it like it's the latest Sports Illustrated.  You're a weird person, Anthony.  He shoved it in my face.  You said that perfectly.  That character in The Wrestler.  You see The Wrestler?  Yes, I did.  The end character was based on him.  The guy that walked in with the flag.  Not the blonde, obviously. 
[00:10:30]  It's kind of the, you know what it is, though?  It's kind of like Requiem for Heavyweight kind of a thing.  You know, it's every wrestler that went through that.  The Sheik wants to know why you don't want to have a picture.  I have great pictures.  We'll talk for a minute.  He's coming back in.  He wants a picture.  Oh, come on.  He wants a picture.  Shake his hand, too.  He wants a picture.  Look, come on.  The Iron Sheik.  Picture with the Iron Sheik, Dad.  Opie.  He wants a picture with the Iron Sheik.  Opie, you got to get on that group picture.  Oh, he's got his hand right at Anthony's neck. 
[00:11:00]  Opie, you got to get it on this.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's get it.  Everybody.  Let's get it.  Let's get it.  I don't like you.  I don't take pictures with you.  It's turning into a fucking photo shoot.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go.  Anthony and the Opie. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Opie's actually on the side where the Iron Sheik grabbed his dick with that hand.  Oh.  It's right on the back of the manager's neck.  One more.  I want to zoom it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That shit was just pointing to the wet spot on the Sheik's urine-soaked slacks.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:12:00]  Take you up here, Anthony Cogliss.  Thank you.  I'll see you, buddy.  Good for you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  There goes the Iron Sheik.  Firing up another fine broadcast.  Rich, you know he grabbed his dick with that hand.  You just shook his hand.  That's okay.  I probably would have grabbed it myself.  He's famous.  What's that?  Wait till I grab Sandy Koufax.  We'll wrap him up.  He's great.  How do you not like that guy?  Did he grab it with that hand?  Yeah.  Dude.  I totally, I totally, like.  He went to shake my hand.  I just patted him on the back with both of my hands. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, my God.  I just shook his hand.  You shook his hand.  That's that hand he grabbed.  He's leaking.  He's leaking.  He's leaking.  What?  You're pointing at him.  I'll be picturing.  Dude, you're pointing.  These pictures are cool.  Dude, let me see that one.  You've got to see these pictures.  They're so cruel.  It's the worst of 2009.  Hey, it's Obi and Anthony welcoming all the new subscribers joining us after turning on their new XM and Sirius radios.  Describe the show a bit. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  It's hijinks, shenanigans, and trying to keep our jobs.  Thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Obi and Anthony.  It's Obi and Anthony's worst of 2009.  Hosted by Sam and E-Rock.  Whoop-ee.  On the virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Obi and Anthony show with Sam and E-Rock.  Well, Sam, it seems the tension among the staff is high yet again. 
[00:13:30]  It started as a fight between Eric and Steve and degenerated into a fight with the entire staff and Steve.  All over Steve's poor choice of breakfast.  Cheeseburgers, cheeseburgers, and more.  It's number 12 on the worst of 2009 countdown.  It's the worst of 2009.  Talking of food, I guess behind the scenes, all hell is breaking loose, Anthony.  Yeah, there's things going on.  I heard a discussion.  And I want to make it perfectly clear that me and Ant are bringing this to the air. 
[00:14:00]  Because these guys actually said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't do this.  No, no, no.  We go to the air.  Blah, blah, blah.  We go to the air.  Yep.  What's going on?  Oh, we said that E-Rock takes pictures of Steve's breakfast every morning, right?  E-Rock, you've been doing that for a while.  Yeah, for months now.  Yeah, I know.  I've seen your pics on your Twitter.  And they're quite hefty breakfasts.  And it's just funny.  I mean, if you're going to use Twitter, that's the way to use it.  Yeah.  Humiliate somebody.  That's what it's there for. 
[00:14:30]  But he wasn't aware you were doing this?  Well, he knew earlier on that after the first time, I guess we mentioned that on the air  that we were taking photos of his breakfast.  So, yeah, he was aware of this.  And he never said not to in the past, right?  So we kept, oh, I kept doing it.  And today just set him off because he said, I've put up with this long enough.  I'm tired of this.  And when this segment was done, I walked back to the office.  Well, the picture was, what, some kind of omelet with a lot of ketchup, a whole thing 
[00:15:00]  of fries that would probably, honestly, feed a family of four as a side.  A side dish.  Fries and eggs?  And then some kind of, like, chicken.  Chicken with lettuce, but there's a giant blue cheese.  Like, the chicken and lettuce would be fine.  That should be the breakfast.  The chicken and the lettuce without the big packet of blue cheese dressing.  All those three together.  Who makes fries for breakfast, though?  Like, where do you find a restaurant that'll put on the fucking fryer in the morning? 
[00:15:30]  Fucking fries.  He's on some kind of weird diet.  Hmm?  Exactly.  I didn't make the look, Steve.  Don't worry.  E-Rock.  So I go back to the office, and I said, I looked at Steve, and he wasn't looking at me.  By the way, it was a good bit for the show.  And that's all, I explained this to E-Rock.  I go, that's all I care about in the end, is a good fucking radio show.  You know, I can't be bothered with whose fucking feelings I heard on a given day. 
[00:16:00]  We all take a turn, you know, under the bus.  I want to look at the clock and see that 40 quality minutes just went by.  Yeah.  That, to me, is like, ah, we're doing our job.  You know how uncomfortable I felt with my Dave Thomas theory?  Of course.  I fucking ate a shit sandwich this morning, okay?  I know it was.  I know!  Trying to show I'm smart by doing my Dave Thomas theory.  Oof.  You don't think I heated up inside?  A little warm?  Yeah.  And that's what this show's about. 
[00:16:30]  I could care less if feelings are being hurt.  Anyway, E-Rock.  So I walk in, he's not looking at me, so I kind of pat him on the back.  I said, hey, sorry, Steve.  And he says, don't fucking talk to me.  Oh, boy.  Don't fucking look at me.  Stay the fuck away from me.  That he had it.  So I go, okay.  Is he looking in a mirror at the time?  Just self-loathing?  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Jesus.  Well, whatever. 
[00:17:00]  Anyway.  See, but that's, well, whatever.  Yeah.  So he said all that to you.  So he said that, and I go, come on, Steve.  And he goes, no, I'm fucking tired of this.  I said, but I've been doing this for a long time, and you know that I've been doing this.  And he said, I've kept my mouth shut, and I'm not going to.  Not in the morning.  Not.  With all that.  And he's not going to.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Jesus.  Sorry.  Continue, E-Rock.  And he's not going to stand for this anymore. 
[00:17:30]  So I said, okay, okay.  Wait, can I stop you for a second?  And this is the point I was making to E-Rock during the commercials.  Steve's saying that to E-Rock, who ate the biggest shit sandwich of the week with that  virus bit.  Ah.  So he had no problem when you were under the bus, right?  Taking a lot of shit from a lot of people.  Well, he said he felt bad, but, you know, that's where it was.  But it wasn't him.  Once it's him, then that's when the problem occurs.  He doesn't like to be goofed on whatsoever.  He said he felt bad.  He understood why I was upset. 
[00:18:00]  But, you know, what else was he going to do?  Right, right.  Okay.  I didn't, quite frankly.  I really didn't understand why you were upset.  It was a funny bit.  Yeah, we like it.  It's like a funny, yeah, it's funny.  We do like the virus bit.  So Steve's really upset, so I go, okay, just get the fuck away from me.  So I walk out of the office, and I walk into the second office where Sam is sitting.  And you were still near him.  Yeah.  Well.  Oh, it's...  I, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh.  Maybe he's just super sensitive because that probe crashed into him earlier this morning. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, oh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh, nigh.  Did they find water or what?  I found French fry oil.  Oh, man.  What are you doing?  I, nigh, I, nigh.  Jeez, Ed, come on.  Come on.  Okay.  Sorry.  Where's Ozo when you need him?  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  So he says, get the fuck away from me.  So I leave the office and head into Sam's office, which Steve then follows me into Sam's office. 
[00:19:00]  And I sit down, and he continues going after me, screaming at me, saying, you know, fuck me.  All the favors that he's done, and, you know, don't expect me to help you out with all this other shit anymore.  I'm tired of this stuff.  You better pick a side.  I know.  Pick a side?  And I'm like, Steve, I'm trying to tell him this wasn't as bad as he's making this.  You know, because out of everybody, I pick on him the least, and what I do to him is hardly really bad, considering what he gets on a daily basis. 
[00:19:30]  What side, though?  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  There's fucking sides being chosen?  What did he mean?  Maybe he meant Eastern and Western Hemisphere.  What side?  Are there teams here?  Oh, come on.  We all know there's teams, Ed.  I know that.  I just want someone to say it.  We all secretly acknowledge that.  I mean, come on.  But somehow it works.  Split right down the middle to it.  The Jets and the Sharks.  That's the beauty of this show.  It's pretty much split right down the middle. 
[00:20:00]  But what about Steve?  That's the problem.  He's not on one of the sides.  He's his own side?  There's a Team Anthony.  There's a Team Opie.  But then everyone gets along.  But Steve doesn't feel like he's part of a team.  So it's like the whole show's on one side of a seesaw.  He's on the other and it's level?  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  And that's just based on we just get along with members of the staff better than others.  I don't hate anyone on the staff, to be honest with you. 
[00:20:30]  I think geographically certain things work out better than others.  I don't hate anyone.  Perhaps if Sam lived a little closer to me, he'd be my little twink friend.  Yay!  Yeah.  Instead of Opie's flunky.  And if Danny didn't live in Queens and hop, skip, and a jump to my house, perhaps we wouldn't black out drunk together on the weekends.  There is free beer, so I'd probably make the trip.  How many for these teams? 
[00:21:00]  How many guys work here?  I know.  I only know like three.  I don't think that's even what Steve's talking about.  No, no.  What is Steve referencing?  Yeah, wait, Sam's on it.  Let's go.  Steve thinks there's...  Look at Sam makes me sick.  He's a smarmy little douche.  He really is.  He put his head down like a, well, I'm sorry to have to say this, but...  But they're asking.  Meanwhile, he's happy as a pig and shit to mix this up.  He's chomping at the bit.  He can't wait to get on mic.  Mix it up, you little prick.  Go ahead.  You guys are confused.  You're describing the Opie team and Anthony teams. 
[00:21:30]  Those are the on-air teams, not the behind-the-scenes teams.  Now there's a behind-the-scenes team, which is, well, I mean, there's a documented rift  between Steve and Danny, so I would assume that it would be Team Steve and Team Danny back  there.  So I think those were, that was the team.  Is there members of Team Steve, though?  Behind the scenes?  Holy shit.  Is there anyone on Team Steve? 
[00:22:00]  I think Steve felt that Eric was a member of Team Steve, and when Eric did what he did  on the air, Steve felt he was maybe leaning over towards Team Danny, although since Eric  also hates Danny, I doubt he's on that team, too.  So how did that happen?  I don't think they hate each other that much.  Steve seems very nice to me.  What does he do to have this more?  He doesn't want to be part of the farm.  Maybe I don't have to deal with it, like, because I just come here to talk shit, but... 
[00:22:30]  So he followed you and started yelling and screaming?  Sam, you saw this?  Yeah.  And you're saying Steve is...  Look at Sam!  And you're saying Steve is way out of line?  Steve's a party pooper?  There was other people that witnessed this, too, out in the hallway.  Uh-oh.  I'm saying Steve was a bit over the top.  He kept yelling at Eric and said that...  Almost killed.  I said that.  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  Can Steve fire anybody?  No.  Is he somebody's boss?  No.  To be completely honest with you, if there's a lot of honesty today, you can't fire shit. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, jeez.  You can.  Steve's a figurehead.  I thought Steve can fire people.  Steve's a figurehead.  He's my superior.  What?  Definitely.  Yeah, shut up.  He is.  He can't fire anyone.  Steve can fire you?  I mean...  I know he can suspend you.  Okay, Danny.  Oh!  Ay, nigh.  Ay, nigh.  Ay, nigh.  He can write reports on people.  No, people have...  To get to who? 
[00:23:30]  Patrice.  To get to the next level boss up.  No, no, it ain't happening.  Here's the deal with this place.  A lot of people have, like, fake titles,  but in the end, Ant and I run the entire company.  Yeah, we run the whole company, actually.  For real.  No one's getting fired without our say.  Don't make me go upstairs.  Steve can't fire anyone.  No.  I mean, Opie's the main boss, so...  He could suggest...  Hey, what about Anthony?  Opie and Anthony.  I mean, Opie's...  That was because of a team Opie thing.  I know, because he's team Opie.  He just happened to be the one who was speaking.  Danny would say you're the boss, so it works out.  I know.  Opie was just the one speaking at the time. 
[00:24:00]  I hear you.  If you had said that, I would have said Anthony's the main boss.  So there's no worry.  And is this why Steve is not here right now?  I don't know why he hasn't...  No, but while Steve was yelling at Eric...  He could suggest...  I'll be fair.  He could suggest a firing.  But in the end, it's up to Ant and I who gets fired.  But if that's the case, everybody can suggest a firing.  Of course!  That's what I'm saying.  And then there's other bosses that are higher...  The janitor could suggest a firing.  Then there's other bosses that are higher than Steve that think they have power.  It's a whole joke.  He's the eunuch producer. 
[00:24:30]  He's like a eunuch.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Steve said he preferred to keep his head down and remain off the air.  Head down into the plate of a fucking friend.  To a trunk.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Oh my god.  This is brutal.  Why is it brutal?  It's so brutal, man.  This is what happens at every fucking workplace. 
[00:25:00]  I guess you're right.  You're just talking about it.  Steve prefers to do what his job is, booking guests and making the proper phone calls and  emails, but remain off the air.  Why do you say that with a smile, Sam?  I'm happy to be here.  I'm at the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a good day for me every day.  So Steve will not be joining us on the air for this discussion?  I frankly, I highly doubt it.  You know, the person who would be pissed off by that the most would be Jimmy.  Norton would be losing his fucking ass.  You tell him to get his fucking ass in here. 
[00:25:30]  It's part of the fucking show.  It's for the show, you fucking asshole.  That's what Jimmy would be saying.  He'd be very angry.  But that's Steve's prerogative.  You know.  I'm hurt for Steve, because I know that Steve has to think that he's higher than these guys.  You would have to feel like he thinks he can more than suggest things.  No.  If Steve tells me what to do, I always do it. 
[00:26:00]  He is superior.  See, if something happens off the air, if there's an argument or some discussion off  the air that is, you know, kind of nasty, then he could write, file a little report about  the person.  And who gets it?  You?  No.  We wouldn't see it.  What are you, I'm going to look at a fucking report?  No, we'd get knocked upstairs.  Someone's asking about Roland, because we said that no one gets fired without our approval.  Roland didn't work for...  No, no, he didn't work for the show.  Except for another company that kind of strong-armed the company, CBS, to not continue with Roland. 
[00:26:30]  He was a subcontractor.  They want to wait too much money.  And we're trying to get Roland hired here.  But, yeah.  Kind of a different situation, to be honest with you.  There have just been, you know, things.  Oh, that's so funny.  Steve said Eric was kicking him in the dick.  Oh, yeah.  You're kicking me in the dick.  He's like, how many times are you going to keep kicking me in the dick?  Wow. 
[00:27:00]  Because of his breakfast?  Apparently, yeah.  Does he know what show he works for?  No.  This is easy stuff.  That's a hilarious breakfast, though.  This is easy stuff.  It's a funny-ass breakfast.  Something's going on deeper than this, because this is breakfast.  That's easy.  This is breakfast.  Dude, when you order a watermelon, what's the first thing we do?  We make fun of you.  Who can get, here's the thing, here's the funny part.  Who can get chicken, french fries, and eggs at breakfast time?  That's very resourceful.  And it's a hilarious breakfast with blue cheese. 
[00:27:30]  It's a weird breakfast.  It doesn't really make sense.  It doesn't make any sense, that breakfast.  Why is he so ashamed of this breakfast?  Why brings it from home?  Oh, he brings it from home.  Yeah, it's deeper than that.  Patrice is absolutely right, because we all get smashed on this show.  Oh, but he shouldn't be so hurt about this.  This is some type of posthumous breakfast that he dedicates to somebody that's not around anymore.  Look at that fucking breakfast.  Two giant cheeseburgers.  Look at the angry bite marks.  Look at how those bite marks are like Velociraptor. 
[00:28:00]  Like a Velociraptor got it.  Why wouldn't, first of all, every morning, here's the genius of Eric right now.  Every morning I would look at that and go, what the fuck?  Who are you, man versus food, niggas?  I think food's winning.  For the record, Patrice, a big guy, is laughing at all the fat jokes, okay?  Because that's all it is.  Why is he upset about this?  He's eating two hamburgers for breakfast. 
[00:28:30]  And we're not supposed to comment about that?  I believe he feels he is shat upon more than other people.  Steve is not even close.  The only shitting, I would say, as a fan of the show, E-Rock gets shit on twice as much.  And that's why it's so weird that Steve goes after E-Rock to understand what E-Rock takes on a daily basis from this radio show.  As a person who's a fan, and as a person who comes through, I'm not here all the time.  Yeah.  But from what I think, I can, and from what I understand, I'd be a silent partner by Tuesday. 
[00:29:00]  Eric gets fucked with a lot.  Yes.  Sam gets fucked with none.  Barely none.  Well, because he postured himself.  He postured himself.  Danny barely gets fucked with.  Danny doesn't get fucked with.  And Travis.  Travis gets fucked with because he's a blue bitch.  Dude, that's not true.  He's a skinny little girl bitch.  But I'm saying it in terms...  He's a homosexual.  Danny takes a...  That married a girl just to prove that he wasn't homo, but he is, and his child isn't his.  Why do you keep kicking me in the dick, man?  I think the only thing Steve has is the gay voice thing is his only... 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  Now he has, uh...  Now he's got breakfast.  Now he has food.  Now he's got breakfast.  Sam doesn't get fucked with that much because he's a smarmy motherfucker who could turn it right around.  Danny doesn't get fucked with as much on the air because he just turns around and goes,  Let's go fuck yourself.  And, like, it's the end of the story.  Like, hey, fuck you.  And it's over.  You know what?  That's not fair.  You're simplifying it.  Everyone gets fucked with.  They really don't. 
[00:30:00]  But my point is Steve does not get a whole lot of nothing except for the Steve voice.  Right.  Yes.  That's it.  That's funny.  But now he has the gay voice.  Now he's the gay voice who eats two cheeseburgers.  Giant fucking bites out of cheeseburgers.  And here's how big they are.  They don't fit in the thing.  I know they don't.  So he ate them for them to fit in the thing.  He had to take three gigantic bites so it fits in the fucking plastic container. 
[00:30:30]  Because two won't fit.  One and a half fit.  How can he be so fucking upset about this?  I want to know.  Can you get them?  When he bought these, did he tell the guy he'll gladly pay them Tuesday for those today?  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Where's Steve, man?  Can we talk to Steve, please?  I don't make fun of this. 
[00:31:00]  I just want to know what's going on.  Why the fuck is he so upset about this?  Let's get Steve in here and settle this.  There's a deeper thing.  He can't be upset about this.  It's a giant, it's a half-eaten giant burger and a full giant burger.  Yeah, Steve, come on down here and explain.  It was an omelet, french fries, and a chicken salad.  Yeah.  For breakfast.  Yeah, we got to, you know, it's got to be discussed.  Why wouldn't we discuss that?  That he brings from home.  He made two big sandwiches?  Did he make these at the house? 
[00:31:30]  That he bought for breakfast?  Cooking up cheeseburgers at four in the morning, three in the morning, putting them in tubbyware.  And trust me, this is not a diet.  To cook at four in the morning.  No.  If there were two hamburgers with no bun, I would say, okay, he's doing some Atkins, but...  Oh, I don't see...  The french fries fucked it up.  So, Iraq, how did it end?  Well, that was the, that was sort of the end of the first fight.  He left the second office and went into, back into our office and just wasn't talking at all. 
[00:32:00]  Then, during one of the commercial breaks, I'm down here and I'm talking with Sam about doing something for the weekend.  And he goes, come here.  And he pulls me away from everybody down the hallway.  And, you know, I was pretty much told to shut up and listen while he just unloaded on me.  Wow.  Um, stating that, uh...  Pointing and waving?  Pointing, uh, that little crazy psycho dead stare right through you kind of thing. 
[00:32:30]  Just pointing.  I, nigh.  Oh, man.  I'm very familiar with this talk.  Yeah?  Yeah.  To the point where, you know, he's sweating as he's talking because he's really intense.  Now he's coming.  And this was a different Steve than I've seen on a daily basis.  Oh, wow.  So I just, I'm like, okay, and I sat there.  Play the Dolph Vader March music right here.  Look at this.  Dolph Vader March music.  This motherfucker.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Aw, shit. 
[00:33:00]  Here's, just so we're all abundantly clear, what I said to Eric.  It was, yeah, I got my finger right in his face, looked at him as if he was a piece of fucking hamburger that had just been ripped through.  And, um, ooh.  I said, I'm a good guy.  And I will continue to be a good guy to you until you fuck with me one too many times.  And then I will, yeah, exactly.  And then I will direct all of that good guy energy to fucking with you nonstop.  And then you will suggest that something happens to him.  No, I'll just start doing it. 
[00:33:30]  No, you shit.  Because I am a vindictive motherfucker when I get screwed with.  But, okay, now two things.  One, that's interesting.  Because I've been finding out the politics.  I mean, he'll get along.  I like Steve, man.  And I would never have had a problem.  But they say you only have the power of suggestion.  Yeah, basically.  Basically.  Basically, you're a magician in here when it comes to them.  So, basically, what could you do to really fuck with them if you have no, nothing more than suggestion? 
[00:34:00]  It's not so much fucking with them, like, within here.  You can't really do anything.  You are.  You're completely castrated in here.  Nobody has any power.  Nobody has any power.  But I'm the first person, a lot of times, that people come to and, hey, can you get me into this event?  Hey, can you get me tickets to this event?  Okay, okay.  Who does that?  You're like fucking Morgan Freeman from Shawshank.  You get things.  I'm the first person on the phone with publicists and ticket brokers and people that need free shit. 
[00:34:30]  I'm happy to do it.  All of a sudden, oh, let's fuck with them a little bit.  The guy that gets the free shit, let's go fuck with them a little bit.  Oh, really?  Steve, I haven't asked you for tickets to...  This week?  No.  When did I ask you for tickets to an event?  I don't do...  It's not so much...  No, you brought it up.  Bring it and tell me when I asked you.  It's not tickets.  Yeah, I've never asked for anything.  What do I ask you for? 
[00:35:00]  I know one thing and it wasn't even for me.  What?  Stargate fucking box sets?  No, that came from the publicists.  Now, do you hear the stuttering in Eric's voice a little bit right now?  You just stuttered a little bit, dude.  It's taking advantage.  It's taking advantage of someone's good nature who is happy to fucking do stuff for you until,  bing, there's a little needle.  Dude, I'd never do anything to you.  That's the one thing that I've been doing for the longest time. 
[00:35:30]  And I know you've been doing it for the longest time.  You haven't said one word that this was a problem.  Now, let's get to the real thing.  Yeah, what's the problem?  Why are you upset?  First of all, I've seen a picture of your breakfast.  Yeah.  Two giant hamburgers.  You're right.  It's usually something I didn't eat the night before.  And french fries, an omelet, and a chicken salad sandwich or something.  Yeah, something like that.  Why are you upset that that is out there?  Because I'm a fucking addict who is able to kick every other fucking thing that he's been  addicted to, but he hasn't been able to fucking deal with this one yet. 
[00:36:00]  So, for some reason, that one strikes a nerve.  Because I got over it once, dropped a pile of weight, got fucking surgery, and then when  I stopped drinking, I jumped over to this addiction.  So, this is a little pity party for yourself.  No, that's not a pity party at all.  It's not a pity party.  I think that the ridiculousness of this will help you in the long run.  No.  I'll tell you something.  My old man, when I was a kid...  It's helping me, nigga.  No.  Here's something.  You got that giant hamburger.  When I was a kid, my old man used to tell me, to my face, the world does not respect 
[00:36:30]  fat people.  You'll never get married.  You'll never get a job.  No one will ever love you.  I ballooned up to 400 pounds by the time I was 23 years old.  And you found out that he was right.  So, you lost weight.  No, I actually...  No.  400 pound motherfucking...  It's difficult.  You wound up achieving everything except for the people liking you.  Right.  Thank you.  So, Steve, this fat issue...  I know.  This is...  And I'm not being funny, man.  Usually fat dudes... 
[00:37:00]  Jolly.  Because we have the ability to be other than fat.  I mean, I know personality-wise, you got to be a little above a notch if you're fat.  Why?  That's like such a...  Man, I don't want to say woman, but it's such a how women get depressed about fatness.  Dudes get depressed about fat a little bit more dude-ish.  Different...  Like, you shouldn't...  You should be able to see that this is funny.  Yes.  Intellectually, I see it.  Emotionally, I don't.  So, aha!  So, you should really... 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, but the problem is E-Rock went through the same shit this week.  He didn't like the bit he was involved with.  Eric's a perpetual victim, unfortunately.  But you're being one, too, right now.  No, I don't think so.  Not at all.  Not at all.  How so?  You're being a victim right now.  How so?  How so I being a victimized?  Because you told us once upon a time, I was a little boy, who my father told me this.  You asked what was behind it.  I'm telling you what was behind it.  But that behind-it-ness is...  And I'm not saying you're perpetual, but you're being...  You're victimizing yourself because you're angry emotionally about this. 
[00:38:00]  It's not personal.  This is internal.  He just clicks on...  It's not his fault that you're having this issue.  No, it's not his fault that he's having this issue.  What he's doing is instigating.  What he's doing is acting as a catalyst.  Now, did you know that he had this issue with his size?  No.  The way he does?  No.  Now he does.  If he does it again, then it's a good story.  Now he does, and he'll do it twice as much.  Now he does, and he'll do it twice as much.  There's been times, too, I've seen some of the horrible shit that he was eating, and I'd say, 
[00:38:30]  Steve, with your surgery and everything else, are you supposed to be eating the bread?  Are you supposed to be doing this?  No, I'm not.  I've talked to him about this a few times.  And that added with, he knew I'd been doing this for a while.  Now, today, everything just fucking hit, and he went off.  You're a victim, you rock.  Apparently.  Well, defend yourself.  You want a rape kit?  You could swab your ass and get some DNA. 
[00:39:00]  Victim.  Victim.  Victim.  Victim.  That shit is hilarious, Steve.  His new character, Victim.  Vic.  Vic.  Fucking hamburger.  Yeah, you know what?  Victim is fucking dumb.  You're right.  Victim.  You're right.  Victim.  I get it.  Now you're a victim.  He just touched a nerve.  Yes.  Now you're a victim.  And you know what you do?  I used to work on fucking Lansdowne Street.  You know what the hardest book bitch is?  I used to work on Lansdowne Street.  Every fucking night.  In Boston?  Yeah.  Okay.  Every fucking night.  Do you know what a joy it is? 
[00:39:30]  Boring.  Oh, shit.  This is something Patrice can't...  I didn't even see your hand move.  Ow.  God damn.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That was bad, man.  Why are you reaching for your little machine, man?  No, I want to prove that.  No, really.  Steve's opening up.  It's about time he opens up.  Oh, my God, man.  Lansdowne Street.  Don't be mad. 
[00:40:00]  No, it's boring.  Once upon a time.  That's funny.  Oh, fuck balls.  Steve, I swear to God, call me off air.  I want to talk to you, man.  Fuck that.  Why is E-Rock hiding his face?  Because he's embarrassed that he's a victim?  He's Vic-dum.  Vic-dum.  I just got it.  Vic-dum.  Why are you laughing at that?  That hurts E-Rock, dude.  Vic-dum.  But that's what we're getting at.  That hurts him personally.  I love Vic-dum.  He doesn't want to be called Vic-dum. 
[00:40:30]  Vic-dum.  Best name ever.  Hey, Vic.  Mr. Dumb.  God damn it.  Table's ready.  So, Lansdowne Street.  Look, I'm not even close to buttons.  You said you worked on Lansdowne Street.  I worked on Lansdowne Street.  And it was huge then.  So, but when somebody fucks with you when you're working in that place, what can you  do?  You punch them in the face.  As hard as you fucking can. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  You can't do that anymore in civilized walking upright person society.  How much weight have you gained back since the surgery, since you're smallest?  Since my smallest, about 50 pounds.  Probably 40, 50 pounds.  That's not a complete full and off.  No, it's not.  But it's still, it's fucking...  Some coke.  No.  No?  Oh, okay.  I'm an addict.  I don't do that shit.  I can't do that shit.  No?  My sister died of a drug overdose.  So, I don't do that shit.  Coke in moderation?  You ever hear anybody?  I do coke in moderation.  One nostril a week. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, that's it.  Can't do that.  So, now with my inherent developed ability, obviously, this is years ago, to deal with  people on a confrontational level taken away, I'm not as witty as these guys.  I'm not, you know, and I'm not as witty as you, or Ope, or Ant, or Jimmy, so I really  can't hold my own in here.  So...  But you say you're not as witty as Eric?  I'm not talking about Eric.  I just pointed at...  I'm sorry, Patrice.  It's Vic.  Yeah, I'm sorry. 
[00:42:00]  Patrice, I clearly pointed at you, Ope, and Ant, and referenced Jim, who isn't here.  Pitted.  So pitted.  So pitted.  This is crazy, man.  So, what is it...  This is fucking crazy.  Like, you must understand that it's not a good breakfast.  Absolutely.  So, why not just not have the french fries?  Most, you know what, most days I throw them out, I bring them here, I don't eat them, I  throw them out.  And the fact that I'm bringing them here... 
[00:42:30]  And I understand his addiction, by the way.  I'm a fool.  But I understand, too.  But it's like falling off the wagon.  You gotta, you gotta, like, get back on.  Now, there was a point, you're working out, you're fucking, you know, you weren't, you  weren't, uh, uh, you were, you were big guy.  You know, muscles and shit like that.  Yeah.  And then you pack on a few pounds, and then you must realize and go, alright, I gotta do  something about this.  Now, your woman, your woman is, she was a trainer, right?  She is.  She's a trainer.  Well, she's pregnant now, but she's a, she's a, she's a fitness model and a female bodybuilder. 
[00:43:00]  So, so, so, as soon as y'all get, get, have the baby, she's gonna, you're gonna get right  back on stage, yes.  But you'll be, but you'll be right back doing her, she makes you do your thing, right?  Um, truthfully, I've asked her to help me get, get back on, get back, get my shit back  together, because I was, didn't like the way I, uh, I looked, but I've been fucking sliding  like crazy.  Anthony, Susan Waldman just saw a picture of, uh, Steve's breakfast.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh no, oh no, E-Rock, E-Rock's 
[00:43:30]  a victim, that's all I, Vic, Dom, I love Vic, Dom, what's up, Vic, Victor, Dom, Dr. Van  Dom, Victor, Van Dom, that's terrible, man, Sean Claude Van Dom. 
[00:44:00]  Uh, no, E-Rock, E-Rock, comment?  No, no.  Do you feel like you're a victim?  Today I do, yes.  Today?  Why today?  It's not even about you today.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Like, earlier in the week, yeah.  Uh, only you can fix yourself, Steve, um, let's see.  You do realize that you're overreacting with these pictures, but I'm, but I'm also, I'm 
[00:44:30]  also completely irrational and crazy.  All right, fair enough.  What was that?  I'm irrational and crazy.  Thank you.  Oh.  I've never debated that fact.  The fact that I walk in here and, and, and, and on multiple occasions have thought about  eviscerating somebody with my bare fucking hands.  I've never seen his eyes, I've never seen his eyes like this.  Especially for a person in a leadership role, it's very healthy.  Go crying.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't you?  Yeah, from designated wiseass over there.  Hey, I'm just stating, I'm just stating the obvious and fact.  Danny doesn't like me, so anything you, you, you, anything he says you have to think.  Can this be, can this, can this be, can this be, he called him Buster. 
[00:45:00]  Buster.  Buster.  Yeah.  Danny's the most disrespectful shit mouth on the entire staff, so.  Hold on now.  Anything that he says has to be taken with several.  Hold on there, chief.  Yeah.  Buster.  Hold on there, chief.  Let's just, hey.  Wait a second, champ.  Allie.  Can, can this thing ever be fixed?  I, you know what, you know what, I extended an olive branch a few weeks ago and Danny subsequently  wiped his ass with it.  What was that?  What olive branch?  I offered to speak, I wrote you a polite email and said, you know what, it's been a while 
[00:45:30]  since we spoke, I think you and I should really have a conversation.  Can this be.  I don't, I don't talk to people who, who, who almost punch me in the face and try to get  me fired.  Dude, you are lucky I never connected and knocked your fucking teeth out.  No, you're lucky.  Whoa.  No.  No, I'm not.  Dude, I, I would, the, the reason your attitude is so shitty, I think it's because you've never  had your ass properly fucking handed to you.  Yeah, because that's how you solve problems with people that you have disagreements with.  Yes.  Absolutely.  You just, you just, you just fling hard meat into their faces.  Yes.  You're not the way things work.  No, or you just smash them as hard as you can against a fucking wall. 
[00:46:00]  Steve, that's a, that's a very unhealthy, it's an unhealthy attitude to have about, about,  about disputes and disagreements.  Oh, it fixes them real quick, though.  Oh, da, da, da, da.  It fixes them right fucking quick.  No, Steve, it doesn't fix anything.  Because one person is unresponsive and then a cop in a fucking coma.  And then you're out of the job.  You're out of the job, you go to jail and I sue your balls off.  Sue me for what?  I'm fucking broke, sue me for what?  So who wins?  So then who really wins?  Me.  So keep, so keep, so keep, so keep settling all your disputes and arguments with, uh, 
[00:46:30]  with your big meat fists and see where that gets you.  You know what, though, but Danny, as a, this is, this is unfair, dude.  The, the, the, the, you're both playing, the, this is wrong for you.  Hey, bud, what's your problem?  It's wrong for how you doing.  I hate this place.  And it's wrong for how he's threatening you, but it's wrong how you're doing.  Let me grow up.  The guy that just said, he's just not going to be a witty guy with you.  A Negro.  Y'all should just stop, man.  That's fine.  Look, me, I know Steve for a very long time at this point. 
[00:47:00]  There's no way to fucking be friends again?  And to be honest, no, I don't think so.  Because, uh, there was a, there was a point in time where Steve really, I feel that he  really fucked me really bad.  And I was really pissed, really, really pissed off.  And ever since that day.  Do you feel like you fucked him bad?  No, I didn't.  So that was, that was the day I took him and just do him into fucking garbage.  Because I was like, you know what?  If that's the way you're going to be, bro, then I don't really need to talk to you.  Because he accepts absolutely no responsibility for his actions.  So when I had to answer for him.  That's what we need.  Big fight.  Well, buckaroo. 
[00:47:30]  Wait, what happened?  Buster.  I made some comments about his website and then, and he didn't like it, so.  That's not, that's not it at all.  That is not it at all.  All right, well, prove it.  I always wonder what the big issue was.  Well, prove it any other way.  I honestly don't remember, but there was something that I can't fucking talk about, unfortunately,  because it's a matter of corporate bullshit.  But it had nothing to do with a comment you made about the website.  It was something that I was questioned about regarding your behavior and I had to answer  for.  It got you in trouble.  You thought I did it fucking deliberately.  You did. 
[00:48:00]  Because it was like a day later.  It's nothing worse than not being able to sock a guy who's like fucking saying, I'll  fucking sue you.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll fucking sue you.  Do you know what fucking enrage that elicits?  It's nothing worse than a guy that goes, you're a fucking nothing because you want to  hit me.  You're in a Neanderthal, fat man.  Now eat your burgers.  And he just wants to toss this nigga through a wall.  And he fucking can't.  How you feel, buster? 
[00:48:30]  I didn't realize.  Look, not for nothing, but, you know, I...  This is so fucking annoying.  Razzle dazzle.  I did a lot of stuff for Steve before this internship ever materialized.  It was all pro bono stuff.  I worked for his website, did some writing and stuff for him, you know, and that was  very nice.  And so I felt to be treated in this respect back, I felt was really fucked up and it  was just a smack in the face because he got his feelings hurt personally.  No, that wasn't it.  It isn't, Steve.  That isn't it.  Jesus, this has been years.  Oh my God, you're so wrong. 
[00:49:00]  It's bubbling.  Yeah, yeah.  How could you fucking...  This is amazing.  Sam just goes, oh yeah.  Like, he puts a sad face on Sam like, oh, this is...  I can't even be in the same room as...  Oh, this is so upsetting to me.  Sam is the worst of the world, man.  That he's holding his...  With his hands wasted.  Sam's like one of those Star Trek monsters that gets strength from this.  Like, people fighting, he gets actual strength.  Somewhere in the sewer system of New York City, there's orange goo that's bubbling.  Sam is such a piece of shit. 
[00:49:30]  Sam is a fucking piece of shit.  I will accept that criticism.  I will accept that.  How does Vic dumb feel about all this?  He enjoyed that one.  Yeah.  I heard him laugh.  That was funny.  I didn't think it would get it to be the Steve Danny thing, though, again.  Because that's always getting brought up.  It always is.  It always circles around.  You two have a very volatile work relationship.  Um, yeah.  Yeah, one wants to sock the other.  Yeah.  And the other one goes, please do.  And you'll fucking out of here.  So I can sue you into even further bankruptcy. 
[00:50:00]  Steve's a really...  I've got news for you, buddy.  If you did, that's what I'd do.  Well, good luck, buddy.  How professional is it for a guy who's the executive producer of the show to raise a fist to someone else?  How fucking professional is that?  At the time, it felt like the best thing in the world.  But is it professional, Steve?  I don't get...  This whole fucking room isn't professional.  Are you fucking kidding me?  This is the least professional environment you could possibly work in.  So then you're saying that it's...  I bet you Danny would go...  If he hit him and Steve hit Danny, Danny would go,  Oh, you did it now, pal. 
[00:50:30]  Now you've done it, pal.  I've got pissed off around this place before.  And never once have I thought that a rational reaction would be to raise my fist to somebody.  I've never once thought that that was going to be the proper road to go down in any dispute or disagreement that has ever happened in this building or in the XM building.  Ever.  When's the last time you had a really nasty fist fight and got your face kicked the fuck into a curb?  Seriously.  Did it ever happen?  Dude, that is not the end all and be all of everything. 
[00:51:00]  No, you're not answering the question.  Fists do not solve problems, Steven.  They don't.  Sometimes they do.  Sometimes they really do.  And the fact that you can't answer that question means you probably never have.  So you're right, I need a good ass whipping.  And that'll win me right into shape.  It'll fucking still a sense of humility that you've never fucking had.  I have been hit so fucking hard that I couldn't see straight.  I don't care.  Good.  Well, good.  Good.  You know what?  That says a monumental amount.  You're indifferent and you're a fucking wise ass.  No, your world is completely different than mine.  My world doesn't revolve around physicalities and yours does. 
[00:51:30]  No, it has nothing to do with that.  Yes, it does.  That's your whole argument.  You have a massive problem with authority.  You hate people who fucking even remotely exemplify a father figure.  You fucking hate them.  Wow.  No, that's...  Dude, now you're bringing your own things out.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Look, every fucking reaction to an authoritative decision, this guy fucking acts like he just  pissed in his cornflakes.  Get my dad on the phone.  We'll talk about how much I hate my daddy and how I have daddy issues.  Everybody in this fucking room has daddy issues.  Do you have daddy issues?  You want to come over, Danny?  I love that. 
[00:52:00]  I don't have a daddy issue.  My dad's dead and I fucking loved him the whole time.  What the fuck are you talking about?  One exception.  I have mommy issues.  This is going great.  Steve.  Oh, Travis is here.  Holy shit.  Whoa, Travis left the other room.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got to be on Steve's side.  This is the attack of the nerds.  And Steve is ogre and he can't...  What Steve does is take nerds and throws them through a window and steps on his fucking Terminator 
[00:52:30]  doll that he built and you're fucking...  Travis just tagged in.  He did.  This is fucking...  Who's at your station right now?  Travis?  There are people.  There's a million people right there.  I can't let this happen because this is about to be...  It's Lilliput.  It's like...  It's Lilliput.  He's Gulliver.  It's Gulliver.  It's like they nanny on him with the...  With the...  I'm gonna fucking poke you shit.  And he can't do shit to him.  What does Travis have on this whole thing? 
[00:53:00]  I just don't know what he's got on him.  I completely disagree with Steve.  I completely agree with Danny.  And I'm tired of when Steve comes in here and he just dismisses Danny's opinion as  Danny hates me.  Well, here I am.  And I think that if you punch me in the face, nothing would change.  You would be out of a job and I would still be here.  You'd be in a coma.  More civil...  More civil suits.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Punching me in the face or punching Danny in the face is not gonna solve anything. 
[00:53:30]  You would be out of a job.  Silence is one of the parties.  You know what?  You would be out of a job and...  But he doesn't...  This is the most ridiculous.  He's not gonna ever punch you.  He doesn't think about punching you.  It's that he's...  The way he is...  No, he thinks he's punching him.  Punching is flying.  But he'll never do it.  And that's not healthy for a boss to do.  That's not healthy.  Travis would be at his station going...  You fuckers.  That's not healthy.  I completely agree that by an executive producer saying, 
[00:54:00]  I'm irrational and crazy and I'll threaten to punch you in the face,  that's not healthy.  That's not what the boss should do.  No one wants to work under those circumstances.  How's anyone gonna respect that?  Why do you look and feel like Richard Dreyfuss right now?  You sound like Richard Dreyfuss from Jaws.  You're not gonna...  Until something comes up and bites you in the ass!  No, wait!  You got any better suggestions?  Is this the black girl body slam incident, by the way? 
[00:54:30]  Uh, what?  Wow, just shut down the show.  Holy...  No, the legal...  The legal thing!  What?  What?  Uh, no.  No, no.  All right.  Is anybody...  It was before that.  Leave Steve alone!  Which one was it?  Why don't y'all apologize?  What the fuck?  The Ralphie Mae finger in the butthole?  No fucking way, no fucking way, no fucking way, no fucking way, no fucking way, no fucking way!  Nothing happened what?  Nothing can happen to make this stop.  Nothing?  Oh, I don't think so.  Oh, no. 
[00:55:00]  I think that ship is sailed.  I'm very sorry for that.  Nothing?  I mean, we work together, we have to work together, but aside from that.  But I'm saying not to just be, like, cool?  Dude, this is...  It seems like dudes just don't stay mad at each other when one goes, I'm sorry.  This is very surface.  No, this is deeper than that.  This has been going on for a while.  It's a weird thing to be around somebody like that.  Years, actually.  I couldn't work.  I'd be like, damn, how could you come...  If I came in, if I found out, like, you go...  If I go... 
[00:55:30]  You just go, I hate Patrice.  Yeah.  I come in and I go, this motherfucker hates me.  I'm going to remove myself from this situation.  Steve, how are you going to deal with...  How can you be funny and fun with somebody that just...  I know.  Steve, how are you going to deal with your own child?  Are you going to beat him up if he doesn't listen?  Oh, my God.  Holy...  But, I mean, it's a fair point.  It's a fair point.  Because by your...  You're talking about child abuse.  But by your argument, you're saying, well, you know, you don't listen.  So, my reaction to that is I'll punch you.  So, if you have it in you to, like, work it out a different way with your own child when 
[00:56:00]  your child is born, why not with your answer?  Why not with your answer?  Absolutely different case entirely.  I learned a whole...  I was taught...  Why can't you bring some of those skills to the workplace then?  And not...  I bring a lot...  I actually, you know...  I work on the fact that physical violence isn't going to get...  Physical violence is the final 5% of any confrontation resolution.  Okay?  You try to resolve it every other way before it would ever get to that point, obviously.  But you... 
[00:56:30]  So, the fact that...  So, you're getting close to punching someone because everything else isn't working.  He's at 94.  No, it's just...  You realize that some battles aren't worth fighting.  And with everybody piling on, he's getting close to coming in with three cheeseburgers.  He's going to sit down and he's going to fucking just light this studio up with some fucking  5-1-1s.  You know what I'm saying?  And if he's starting to feel a little bit piled on, because here it comes.  You know what I mean?  I mean, you really got to fix this.  So, the way Patrice is seeing it, it's everyone else's fault except... 
[00:57:00]  And it's a bunch of...  Lookit, I'm on both sides because I've learned that way, but it's really difficult when you're  physically a big dude.  And dudes approach you with not...  Fuck the fact that everybody can't fight or whatever, but dudes understand dudes.  It's like, you can't just be a dude and, one, not accept a motherfucker's apology if  he apologizes.  Now, I'm not saying that he did, but fuck that.  If I go, man, I'm sorry.  You have to go, man. 
[00:57:30]  You got to somehow embrace that.  Two, the idea of not fighting, it's just dudes.  We think about that.  That's how we roll, is we might fight.  And for other dudes to go, I'll sue you, motherfucker.  It just ain't cool as dudes.  This is non-dude shit.  To Eric and everybody, and Sam's out of it, because Sam's just that kind of witty, I guess.  But the motherfucker, I understand what he's saying. 
[00:58:00]  I understand what they're saying, but this ain't dude shit.  That's the thing, man.  You can't be friends or around each other talking about I'm going to sue you there.  That's bitches, man.  He's not my friend.  But you are, though, because you're hurt.  It's a coworker.  I was hurt two years ago.  I don't give a shit to anyone.  But see, you do because you're not over it.  That's what I mean.  I'm completely over it.  You're not over it because you won't embrace being friends again.  That was one thing two years ago.  There's a million things every day. 
[00:58:30]  There's a million things every day.  Fair enough, man.  It's like people that aren't friends but have to work together not liking each other.  Then you don't...  So how do they work together?  What's the example of you working together?  Working together.  Steve and Danny.  Sam runs to the mic.  Old instigator Sam.  You have to understand.  There's two...  You see, we have two offices here.  Danny's in one office.  Steve's in the other office.  They don't mix.  There's no talking. 
[00:59:00]  There's no communication.  So what's the work?  When do they connect as workers?  They don't.  You're watching it.  This is it right now.  You're watching the paperwork.  When is it three degrees of separation from them where these two have to collaborate to  make this show go on?  There's never a time where paperwork transmits from his office to our office.  Everything is very self-contained.  So you don't work together.  No, we do not work together.  You're just dudes that exist in the same space.  He'll tell me that the guest has arrived and that's that.  We'll have a staff meeting once a week with all the staff and the bosses. 
[00:59:30]  Steve will say what he's been doing.  That's news to Danny because they don't communicate whatsoever.  Which might be better.  It's not so much that they don't communicate.  So they're not coworkers.  They just both get paid by SiriusXM and go home.  Steve will go through me to tell Danny something.  It's like a sitcom.  But not anymore because we found out you're just so into.  And then I'll have to ask Travis when I need to get Danny's attention.  Let me ask you a question, Steve.  Seriously.  A serious question. 
[01:00:00]  When Ope wasn't in the other day, why would you hand CDs to everybody else but me?  Because they were on this side of the room and closer to get to.  Oh, no, don't be like that.  You didn't do it on purpose, Steve.  Well, then when have you ever handed Danny a CD when he's sitting here?  I stopped doing it I don't know how many years ago.  So then why would you do it when Ope wasn't in the room?  It was calculated and deliberate.  And just admit the fact that you would rather not communicate with me.  Correct.  Fine.  That's fine.  That's all I have.  Steve's not defending himself.  Well, I think that he doesn't give Danny the CD. 
[01:00:30]  So then don't tell me that I don't communicate at my review next time.  But, you know, it's also, you know what, also, it's also, I hand something to Danny and  I get the Danny eye roll, whatever.  The Danny eye roll, whatever.  That's what Steve's issue is.  Steve, he thinks that you don't give him stuff.  Wait, wait, what?  Steve thinks that if he hands you stuff, it won't get to open.  When have I ever not, what has never, what has never not made it in?  Like, I don't understand what.  Sabotage.  Wow, that's a, this is fucking a, this is a movie. 
[01:01:00]  This is James Bond shit.  Yep, yep, sabotage-y.  And you think of what I'm thinking?  10 second rant time?  Stiff drink.  Oh, and we should all smile now.  10 second tirade.  Tirade?  It's a 10 second tirade?  I think Steve and Danny should each get one and then smile at each other afterwards.  No, because there won't be a smile at the one, so it won't count.  Oh, shit.  So you don't play along with the 10 second tirade?  Nope.  Do it, baby.  They're doing it.  No?  Danny could smile and he could look at the teeth you're going to knock out.  Oh, Steve is just, that, the lack of physicality that Steve can't have right now. 
[01:01:30]  It's got to be frustrating as hell.  I think he would, if he could choke Danny, he would then, even if Danny hated him, he'd  be like, dude, I'm sorry, every day.  Just to get that fucking energy out.  It would look like the beginning of Note Country for Old Men with the cop on the floor.  Like, Danny would be kicking and leaving stuck marks on the floor and Steve would just be  like, argh!  And just fucking choking the shit out of him.  And then he'd go along to everybody else and put that bolt through our heads. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, Danny, what's the most, you've never lost anything in a coin toss, have you?  Vic?  You got anything, Vic?  Vic dumb.  No, I'm not allowed to talk to Steve until I can figure out a way to properly apologize  to him.  Oh, shit.  Have you thought about it yet?  No, not yet.  Well, you go home and think about it, young man.  Are you going to think about it?  He's dumb.  It's Vic dumb.  He's going to go home and think about something like fucking cotton candy and Ferris wheels.  Both guys have a point, man.  Wait, is he rocking?  Are you going to apologize to Steve?  I don't know, man. 
[01:02:30]  I'll think about it.  What side are you on?  I don't see it happening.  Whose side am I on?  I'm on the side of me getting into my fucking truck and going home to my lovely house.  I'm on the side of them.  A stiff drink cutting the copy that they have to take.  Who side you on?  Who do you think should apologize?  Well, first, D-Rock should apologize to Steve.  No, that ain't happening.  I thought about getting him an apology gift, but if I put cheeseburgers down on his desk,  I thought he would get upset.  I'll be honest.  I am biased because I've had personal run-ins with Stephen behind the scenes, things that 
[01:03:00]  I don't want to discuss.  Which makes you believe in the...  No, no, no.  It's just I have a hard time being sympathetic.  I think we understand each other.  We work together.  We were very good friends, like at N.E.W. and stuff like that, but things just happen.  Things happen.  We'll just say that.  And Danny is a very close friend of mine, so I'm a little biased, so I can't really...  Okay.  This is a preponderance of the evidence, too.  This is crazy because it makes Steve look bad. 
[01:03:30]  No, no.  I'm not trying to make Steve look bad.  I'm just saying what the facts are.  He just loses friends.  Here's the problem.  Steve has a major problem.  Because the staff doesn't like him or respect him.  And I don't know how it got to this point, but Steve's got a major problem.  He's got a major problem.  I have sat down each member of this staff.  So you did something because these guys don't like you.  Oh, it is a rise up right here.  I can fit in my shot.  They'd frag you if it was Vietnam. 
[01:04:00]  I'd love that.  And you don't have to like the guy that...  Sergeant Barnes, baby.  And you don't have to like the guy that's higher than you in the hierarchy of a fucking  workplace, but it goes way deeper than that.  Steve wants to go liars.  Now, if we left this room now and he'd lock the door, Steve would sit them all down deaf.  Now, what you all know about death?  He'd kill them.  That's my honesty right there.  Steve's got a major issue with these guys.  Well, you know what?  That goes way past the workplace fucking...  Yeah, I know.  You loved stunt brain. 
[01:04:30]  You want a piece of me?  Like, if it was one...  I'll take a swing at me.  If it was one guy, then okay, but it seems like...  These guys are in agreement.  Well, if that's the case, then everybody lies.  Remember that scene?  Yeah.  Well, go ahead.  Yeah.  You fucking up the machine!  When the machine breaks down, we break down!  And I ain't gonna let that happen, boy. 
[01:05:00]  Now, go ahead.  Y'all low...  Y'all low, Steve.  Go ahead.  I don't know, Steve.  I'm here, fellas.  I'm here, fellas.  I'm here, fellas.  Kill me.  Kill me.  So, what do you say, Bob?  Uh, get the day off?  I got a bad feeling about this Friday.  I got a bad feeling about this one, Travis.  I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.  I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here.  We all gotta die sometime, Travis. 
[01:05:30]  Holy shit.  Fucking Steve wants to put a hole in somebody's ass.  Steve been shit on six times and he's still here.  You can't shit on Steve.  Let's...  Ant, let's have, uh...  Let's have Sam talk for the group.  Sam. 
[01:06:00]  Sam.  Because Danny comes from a place where we're not sure where he's coming from.  Yeah.  Technically.  E-Rock is too much of a pussy to speak up.  He's a victim.  He's a victim.  What, are you a homosexual, Eric?  Sam, talk for the group.  What do you need to know?  About Steve, the work environment, who's wrong, who's right.  The relationship between Steve and the majority of the staff has undeniably been severed.  Wait, start over, man.  Could you start over?  That's a direct contradiction.  This music playing right now is the greatest backdrop for this that ever lived. 
[01:06:30]  See, we don't need Travis because he didn't pick this one.  Oh, my God.  That's how this Steve laughs.  I don't know.  I just feel bad about this, brothers.  I just feel bad.  I just feel bad.  What are you, a crusader, Travis?  We got ourselves a crusader.  We got ourselves a crusader.  Look at this lump of shit.  I cock a doll, Travis. 
[01:07:00]  I cock a doll.  I caught you taking a picture of Steve's breakfast one more time.  I swear to God, you're going to get a goddamn chicken out of here in a body bag.  I shit you not.  I shit you not.  Bag and tag this piece of shit.  Oh, shit.  This music.  Oh, it's perfect.  It's just. 
[01:07:30]  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Sam.  This music is beautiful.  Wrap us up with that.  Yeah, Sam, we'll put it all together.  Perspective.  I think.  Start over.  Because now we're.  Okay.  The relationship between Steve and the majority of the staff.  Not the entire.  Could you start?  Dear Grandma.  Relationship between.  And the majority of the staff has been undeniably severed as evidenced today.  To Steve's credit, the last time Steve had a big thing on the air with all of us against him, 
[01:08:00]  he reached out to all of us.  Get me a medic.  Go on.  Get me a medic.  And he talked to all of us.  Okay, do it.  Yes.  Do it, boy.  Do it, boy.  Give me a medic.  Okay, then.  Do it.  I can't stop.  It's just such a great fucking movie.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  It's a lovely fucking war. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, shit.  Since that time, I've had no issues with Steve at all.  Yeah.  And our relationship is fine.  Our working relationship is totally cool.  I see.  Eric did some things today that got under Steve's skin.  However, I think, and if pressed, Steve would probably admit that his major yelling at Eric  was due to frustrations that maybe Danny and maybe also Travis had built up in Steve. 
[01:09:00]  I can't listen to nothing but just music.  That he took out in there.  I can't listen to shit but just music right now.  But how long ago have they, you know.  What do you mean?  How long ago have they frustrated Steve to where he would take it out?  That's not accurate.  I'll admit it with that.  Danny has been frustrating Steve for two years.  Two years, at least.  Their relationship will never be fixed whatsoever.  We've got to settle this now.  Remember that now.  It's happened back at N.E.W.  They ripped us the fuck apart. 
[01:09:30]  And I personally.  Can you just do this jumping up and down on one leg and laughing?  This music makes everything sad.  It's just.  It's fucking terrible.  This music is fucking the worst.  Adagio is the worst.  It's the saddest music ever made.  I can't.  I want to laugh.  Look at Steve's face.  With this music.  This is terrible.  Yeah.  Sam.  I think Steve's issues with Danny primarily played a part in what he took out on Eric. 
[01:10:00]  And I think that when he says pick a side, as Eric said, he said, I don't know if he said  it or not, but if he said pick a side, I think he believes that the team that's opposing him  is Danny and Travis, since they're such good friends.  Irock is the son of born of those two fathers.  As Ma says, for a battle of your soul. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  It's just.  That's it?  This is it.  I mean, the issue here, the primary issue, even with the Eric thing, all of the issue  is between Steve and Danny.  I think.  Maybe you disagree.  Well, to make a statement, just backing up a few, that my relationship with the entire 
[01:11:00]  staff has been severed, I think that's completely incorrect.  Majority.  Because I've reached out to everybody, and everybody, to my face or over the phone, said  I got no problem with you.  And that was, I don't know, what, two months ago?  Yes.  Two months ago.  So since then, I don't know.  Well, but that's the thing.  You said that's when you reached out to Danny and he didn't respond.  I said I have no problem with you, and I just said.  So one person on the staff.  To the whole studio.  No, I said it too.  To Travis and Danny.  What?  I said it to you too.  What?  To your face.  What?  When you came in to me right after this whole incident, like, what is your fucking problem with  me?  I told you some of the issues I had with you. 
[01:11:30]  I said, overall, I don't, like, fucking hate you as you assumed everyone else here does.  And I told you that to your face.  Eric doesn't have a problem with you.  He just thinks your breakfasts are funny.  Yes.  I understand that.  Danny has a problem with you.  Yes.  I understand that.  And you have a problem with Danny.  Yes.  I don't understand why we don't all hate Sam.  How does he skate?  Why would you hate Sam?  Because he's the Colonel Curse.  How the fuck does he skate?  How does that work?  I don't do anything.  What did he say?  He's Colonel Curse.  Like, he has his own island and, like, you know, all his people. 
[01:12:00]  We've got an apocalypse now.  Well, he knows when, you know, he decides whose heads get severed and stuff.  Yeah.  But everybody's afraid to confront him.  It's weird.  We all should hate Sam.  Why would anybody hate Sam?  I think that's what would solve this problem.  That's not a good solution.  Nobody should hate Sam.  I've never done anything to anybody.  Let's be honest here.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  We've changed movies.  Now we're on to another movie. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  We really need to just wrap up.  It's getting late.  Yeah, it's getting very late.  Because here's the thing.  Sirius XM.  We'll reach your...  I can't believe I'm still at Sirius XM.  We could reach a resolution today.  Yeah.  How?  But in two months...  I'm just saying, some people could apologize and everything.  We could say, okay, everyone's fine.  Within the next two to four months, something will be done.  Steve will get pissed off.  And it will result in, regardless of who is at fault, Steve and Danny arguing. 
[01:13:00]  Because that's where the real problem lies.  Let's be honest with each other.  So if they solve their issue...  Which they won't, ever.  Everything is much better.  But they need to just separate from each other and not worry about each other.  When Danny says he's over Steve, then don't give Steve a second thought.  And Steve should not give Danny a second thought.  Just act as islands amongst each other.  Travis and me.  I hope I can be on your islands. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, but you still have hostility towards Steve.  Well, I'm not going to magically like somebody.  No, there's a difference between...  There's three things here.  There's liking, not liking, and having them out of your system.  And emotionally...  Right, you're not...  He's not indifferent.  Exactly, you're not indifferent.  You do have some...  Dislike.  Some dislike.  You have pain there.  You dislike, Steve.  You don't not care.  Well, because I still have to...  We still have to function on a daily basis.  You don't!  No, we do.  Because I still have to show up, and he has to show up, and we have to cross paths eventually. 
[01:14:00]  We're going to have to build a new staff, man.  Yeah.  Not a whole new staff.  We're going to have to start from scratch.  No, you don't need to fire everybody.  For the third time.  For the third time, we're going to have to start from scratch.  There's no reason.  You've done it before?  What do you think?  But Steve has been able to play.  You did the show at any W, man.  Yeah, Sam, I've watched this happen.  Everyone's gone, except for those two.  Some of us are fine.  Oh, except for which two?  Open app.  Oh.  Some of us are fine.  Back to basics.  Some of us don't have any issues.  Let's go back to basics.  Me and you, kid. 
[01:14:30]  That's it.  Well, I mean, some people...  Nah, we don't need you.  Just stick around and...  Sam, I've been around for 11 years.  The old staff thought they needed us.  You called me throwback, Sam.  I think we made that obvious.  Great.  I've been around.  What's wrong?  What happened, Danny?  No, nothing.  We should just end the show.  Fucking Steve just makes Danny sick.  Vic has something.  Vic?  Well, Vic Dumb.  It's Vic Dumb, everybody.  That name has been taken on Twitter and every message word, by the way.  Vic Dumb.  It's over.  Thank you.  Well, if this is the source of all the conflict... 
[01:15:00]  You.  No, not me.  The Danny Steve stuff here.  If this is the source of Steve's aggravation, then his blow-up today, I think Steve owes  me an apology.  I agree with that.  Oh, shit.  That's fair.  Based on what we...  Yeah, because E-Rock was just trying to keep it fun.  Who's in charge here?  I don't know, man.  I thought you were.  That's perfect.  Jesus.  I think E-Rock was trying to keep it fun and what this show's all about. 
[01:15:30]  I think Eric was under the assumption that we worked on a comedy show.  No.  That's...  That's not the get-out-of-jail-free card.  It's not the...  Dude, yes, it is.  We worked on a comedy show and you're the only one who can't take a joke.  Feels good to laugh.  I got...  I just...  I just got the...  I just...  I just pulled the tubes the size of a shot glass out the hell of a boat.  Look, fellas, let's be reasonable here. 
[01:16:00]  My boy was in that studio, too.  You want to cut Steve open and see how many cheeseburgers he's got?  Oh, God.  I'll not stand by you.  I'm just saying...  I'm just saying...  I didn't say you said it.  It could have been...  Steve?  I'm just saying the bite wounds on that hamburger...  Let's be reasonable here.  This is not the time or place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on an executive producer. 
[01:16:30]  And I, for one, am not going to stay in this studio while we cut Steve open and watch those french fries spill out all over the carpet.  We changed movies again.  How's going on?  I heard that there were some french fries eaten in this table yesterday.  And you knew about it.  I just want to say that Danny and Steve were in the studio at some point and some feelings were hurt. 
[01:17:00]  But everything is fine now.  And this studio will stay open.  Steve, hey man, it's too late now.  You're the mayor of Burger Island.  Can you sing that lullaby for everyone, Ant?  How's it going, Andy?  Do you know the Burger Man? 
[01:17:30]  The Burger Man, the Burger Man.  Do you know the Burger Man?  Wow.  So E-Rock should get an apology because we do work on a comedy show.  And I think E-Rock was trying just to kind of bring some material to the show.  You all know me.  You all know me.  You know what I do for a living.  I'm not talking about hooking bluegills or tommy cats.  I'm talking about Steve.  I'm talking about working for a living.  Steve, man, stop it, man. 
[01:18:00]  What about Cage Goes Into Water?  This is crazy!  Cage goes into the water.  You go into the cage.  Burger's in the cage.  Steve's in the water.  Hi, Steve.  Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish lady.  Farewell and adieu, you lady.  I'll show you this scar on my chin where Steve got mad and punched me in the face.  Show me the way to go home. 
[01:18:30]  Scar on my chin where I tried to take away his burger.  All right, let's get the E-Rock-Steve relationship back together.  The E-Rock-Steve relationship can be mended.  Well, a little apology.  That would be nice.  A mutual apology.  Ain't you watching it, Carleesi?  Steve can't stay down with three barrels in him.  Not with three barrels.  Ah, shit.  Eric, do you feel you did anything wrong today?  No, I do not. 
[01:19:00]  Whoa!  See, that's where we're at.  I'll apologize for you having awful breakfast.  That's about it.  Ah, shit.  Well, then I'm not apologizing for my overreaction.  Now, Steve, you should apologize because you're sorry, not because Eric feels a certain way.  How many burgers did he eat?  20.  25.  All three tons of them.  I nigh.  I nigh. 
[01:19:30]  Hey, Steve, I think, look.  What do you think, Patrice?  Hey, Eric.  Smile, you son of a burger.  I think, I think.  You're going to get this little needle through that flamish shirt?  Not that you're sorry for what you did, but there's a court term called intent versus impact.  You didn't intend to do nothing fucked up, but something fucked up happened.  And you can apologize for the fucked up-ness that happened.  Oh.  You understand?  You don't have to apologize for your intentions, but the fact that you hurt his feelings, you can say, I apologize.  For a harmless, ongoing bit that he was well aware of for the last several months, that just, it was sort of an inside joke to the show that got brought, again, on air, and he couldn't handle it. 
[01:20:00]  It's not an inside joke if you're tweeting it to him.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you.  So, it's not an inside joke if you're publicizing it.  I just want to put that out there.  And Steve, to be fair, him, you know that you, as a dude, I respect your dude-ness, but you got emotional, man.  And you got over-emotional.  I can apologize for-  And you should apologize for the fact of how it got taken and not where it came from. 
[01:20:30]  I can apologize for overreacting if he can apologize for hurting my feelings.  See, this is tit for tat.  It's not, somebody got to be a man about this shit.  The burger has been bitten in two in the middle.  The bun is partially eaten.  This was not a boating accident.  This was a bear attack.  Fries in the basket, basket goes in oil.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:21:00]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  Last week on the ONA show, E-Rock taking twit pics of Steve's enormous breakfast led to an entire staff meltdown.  A conflict between Steve and E-Rock quickly became a conflict between Steve and Danny  that left the whole world wondering, would the staff of the show survive?  We reached out to E-Rock this morning to get an update. 
[01:21:30]  After the big meltdown that you started on Friday, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling okay.  I had no problem this weekend.  And how are things with you and Steve?  I guess okay.  Right after the show, he came over and apologized and gave me an unnecessary hug, which I accepted.  And how excited are you about your new character?  Vic Dumb.  Eric, what are you...  Ow!  While E-Rock used physical violence to avoid backstage reporters, 
[01:22:00]  we moved on to Steve and Danny to see if the two had worked out their differences.  Steve.  Yeah.  After last week's staff meltdown,  How are you doing?  I'm doing surprisingly well.  Thank you, Sam.  How do you think the staff is doing?  I think the staff is doing surprisingly well.  How is your relationship with Eric?  Beautiful.  We kissed and made up after the show Friday.  And the same with Danny?  Eric and I are doing great.  How about...  And Danny and you are also great.  Eric is one of the sweetest boys I've ever met. 
[01:22:30]  Did you mean Danny or Eric?  I can't say enough good things about Eric.  So then you and Danny have not buried the hatchet.  You know, I've tried to reach out in the past to Danny.  And so far, he just doesn't want to talk to me.  I hope that changes in the future.  But right now, I have no control over that.  Hey, Danny.  After last week's staff blowout, how is everything?  Which is fine.  So everything between, like, you and Eric?  Everything's so cool.  Okay, cool.  And you and Steve?  Oh, it's just the same as it ever was. 
[01:23:00]  So, basically terrible.  Of course, yeah.  Why?  There's no reason for it not to be.  But do you see that, you know, the confrontation that happened  kind of brought issues to the forefront  and maybe will come to a resolution?  I hope they do.  I pray they come to resolutions.  Do you see that happening?  Never.  Okay.  Ah, no underlining hostility there.  Obviously, Steve and Danny have conflicting points of view.  And backstage can only assume that their ability to coexist  in the same working area will continue to deteriorate. 
[01:23:30]  However, there is one thing that ONA fans can look forward to.  Hours and hours of material from E-Rock's brand new character, Vic Dumb.  Let's all enjoy laughing at Vic's stupidity as the show crumbles around us.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  It's the worst of 2009.  More coming up next on The Virus.  Hey, everybody.  It's Primetime Sam Roberts.  And E-Rock from the Opie and Anthony show.  And the worst of the week countdown. 
[01:24:00]  And the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And Special Delivery starring Sam and Dave, in my case.  And me too.  I'm there sometimes.  For those of you that are new subscribers, we welcome you to SiriusXM.  You'll be hearing a lot more out of our voices.  During this week, which predominantly features us introducing Opie and Anthony.  My Twitter is now...  Nobody cares about that.  Thank you for subscribing to SiriusXM.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Not Sam.  Damn it.  It's Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2009.  Hosted by...  Guess who? 
[01:24:30]  Hmm.  I don't know.  Sam and E-Rock.  Again?  Yep.  On The Virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony show.  With Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, not too long ago, we did a story about a guy who celebrated 50 years working at the  same McDonald's.  I remember that story because I remember you were actually...  So what happened was this old guy, he celebrated 50 years working at the same McDonald's. 
[01:25:00]  Ah!  You're back on.  Oh.  And...  Because of McDonald's.  And he wasn't really treated fairly as far as we were concerned.  For 50 years of service, they didn't even give him a watch or anything nice.  They gave him the day off.  Yes.  Which is something you want.  No.  So we did...  We read the story and discussed it and...  What?  We got into a lot of trouble over it.  We read the story and discussed it and then we found the guy's phone number and got to  talk to him.  We ended up getting into a little trouble over this one because we tricked him into thinking 
[01:25:30]  something that wasn't the case.  It was one of the cringiest moments of 2009.  It's number 11.  On the worst of 2009 countdown.  It's the worst of 2009.  Hi, Leonard.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Hi, Leonard.  Congratulations on 50 years of service at McDonald's.  On what?  Congratulations on 50 years of service at McDonald's. 
[01:26:00]  Thank you.  That's fantastic.  That's fantastic.  We saw the news story.  Did you?  Yes.  And you've been there in the same store for 50 years?  50 years!  That's right.  That's right.  Fantastic.  How many days have you taken off?  Have you ever taken a vacation?  Oh, yeah.  I get vacations.  Really?  Yeah.  What do you do on vacation, Leonard?  Nothing.  Nothing? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, my God.  What do you work for the Opie and Anthony show?  The other man was in McDonald's.  Yes.  Leonard, do you remember?  What year was the first Negro allowed in McDonald's?  Oh, I don't know.  No?  I don't know.  Was it during the time you were there?  Probably, right?  I would imagine.  Yeah, I would think so.  Before that.  I don't know.  Hey, Leonard, do you like those people?  Do I like what? 
[01:27:00]  Leonard.  Yeah.  Do you eat McDonald's every day?  Well, not every day.  No?  Most of the time, no, I do.  A lot of times.  Do you get it for free?  If I'm working.  Oh, they don't give it to you for free if you're not working?  Uh-uh.  Leonard, what did your scumbag owners get you for 50 years of service?  What kind of gifts did you get? 
[01:27:30]  What kind of what?  Gifts.  What gifts?  Well, I got some gift certificates, that's all.  That's it?  For 50 years?  Told you.  The shitty gifts.  Yeah.  Gift certificates for what, Leonard?  For being here 50 years.  No, what were the gift certificates for?  Yeah, what couldn't you get with them?  Right.  Uh, food?  But you work at a McDonald's.  Leonard, do you remember?  Ask him was he happy with the gifts, man. 
[01:28:00]  Do you remember when the bathroom said white and colored?  No.  Oh.  Heard that one.  Just asking.  A little history.  Was he, was he, did he deserve, did you think he deserved more gifts?  Patrice yelled at him.  Leonard?  Yes.  Do you, were you, were you satisfied with those, with, with what you got for your 50 years  of service?  Eh, I was satisfied.  Did you, did you think you, did you think you, he's not satisfied.  Now, let me ask you a question, Leonard.  Have you ever gone for a promotion? 
[01:28:30]  No.  Why?  You're only a bus, I didn't, I didn't want to.  Why?  I just didn't want to.  Did they ever offer you a better position at, at McDonald's?  Yeah, I was offered twice.  What was the better position?  Uh, being a manager.  A manager?  And you said, no, why, Leonard?  Yeah, why would you say no to that?  Isn't it more money?  Not that much.  So, more aggravation, but not that much more money. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Now, if they had to paid you maybe triple what you're making now, you might consider it?  Well, it could be, maybe.  Are you working now, Leonard?  Yes, I am.  Oh, you're working right now?  That's right.  Is your boss there?  Uh, yeah.  Can we please speak with your boss?  You want to talk to my manager?  We would love to.  Oh, is it a hole? 
[01:29:30]  247.  Damn, that's cheap.  Did I hear 247?  Hello?  Hi, is the manager there?  I'm a manager.  What?  Susan, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  We're very excited about Leonard and his 50 years of service, and we figured we would  talk about him today.  Okay.  Ah, now he's been there 50 years.  How long have you been working as his boss? 
[01:30:00]  22 years.  22 years.  So, about half of his tenure there has been under you, your, um, uh, uh, leadership.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  So, you've been covering for his, uh, mistakes for the last 22 years?  Yeah.  Ah!  See, he was...  Now, did you have anything to do with the planning of this party that made the news?  Uh, no, our owner did it.  Oh, the owner did it.  Oh, are you a little taken aback by the fact that he's been there 50 years and really didn't  get that much?  I'm sorry, uh, my phone was beeping in when you were talking. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  Well, uh, do you think he didn't get that much for having been there 50 years?  Oh, he gets a lot.  And, and, and, and Susan?  Is your name Susan?  Yes.  The question, I'm trying to put this delicately, uh, we saw the story and we were touched by  and we wanted to know if Leonard is, you can't say the same stuff you can say in 1940, which  is, you know, rhymes with e-arted, but is, is he a little, a little slow or a little bit 
[01:31:00]  learning, kind of disabled or anything like that?  Um, no, but as you get a little old, you get a little handicapped, you can't quite keep  up.  So, but what about the 30 years before?  Or is it to mop?  Yeah.  I'm sorry?  Like the 30 years before, like he's 68 now.  How about when he was, uh, say 22 years ago when he was what, 40?  45.  45?  Yeah.  He was pretty good.  Is his mind really sharp?  Yes. 
[01:31:30]  Hmm.  Wow.  Am I wrong on this?  I think he's a shrewd guy.  I just think.  Yeah.  We want to know why he never, why he never ascended to your level.  We want to know why he never got a real job.  A real job?  This is a real job.  Well, maybe a promotion.  No, to your level.  Why didn't he, isn't he at least your same, like why wouldn't he go to management?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  He didn't want to.  He didn't want to.  He was the maintenance man originally.  Maintenance man.  Wow.  And now, and now he's like a bus boy?  Now he can't lift and do the trash and do the maintenance. 
[01:32:00]  So now he's the lobby man.  Okay.  Interesting.  And what is that?  What is he, what is his actual duties?  What does he have to do?  Um, he cleans the dining room, talks to the customers.  Yeah.  Fills, lids, straws, napkins, steaks out.  Now, do you worry about him doing things to the burgers?  No, he don't go back with the burgers.  Oh, he don't, you don't let him fuck with the food?  No, no.  He does the clean up.  Oh, Susan.  I'll let him touch the food.  We really want to know why he's just the clean up guy. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, you gotta let us in on this.  There's a story behind this that isn't coming out.  Why is he still just the clean up guy?  That's what he can do.  Does he get, oh boy, they're not fessing up.  Does he get touchy-feely with the rest of the employees?  Any, any human resources problems?  Oh, shit.  Is he trying to?  Susan's funny.  She, she, she can't, she can't tell.  Is he trying to spread his, his own special sauce? 
[01:33:00]  He's back to him fucking the burgers.  No.  Oh, Susan, you, Susan's hilarious.  Yeah, I like Susan.  Oh my God, man.  I like Susan a lot.  Well, good old Leonard.  Susan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, can we talk to Leonard again?  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Put Leonard on a little more.  I believe you're a corporate McDonald's guy and you're in the fire, please.  Shh, shh, shh.  Can you do that?  Yeah.  Hello, Leonard.  Yeah, this is me again.  Hi, uh, this is, uh, Bill Zamwick with, uh, McDonald's Corporation. 
[01:33:30]  How are you?  This is who?  Bill Zamwick.  Yeah.  I'm with the McDonald's Corporation.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, you put in 50 years of service with us, I recently learned.  And I just want to let you know, uh, something has come up.  You know, we, uh, have been in a recession.  You do understand this.  Have been what?  In a recession.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, you've heard about that.  Um, Leonard, I'm very sorry. 
[01:34:00]  We're, we're gonna have to let you go.  Okay.  We're gonna have to let you go.  Uh, I'm, I'm heartbroken about this.  Uh, the McDonald's Corporation, um, recognizes your years of diligent service with the company.  But, uh, you're gonna have to clean out, um, your stuff and, uh, we'll let you finish out the week.  But, um, on Friday, I'm, I'm really sorry.  You're, you're being terminated.  Okay. 
[01:34:30]  Is the...  Who are you gonna replace me with?  Well, we're, we're doing away with the position.  It is useless.  Uh, it's, it's been deemed, um, redundant.  Uh, there's other people that can do that.  I really do apologize for this.  I'm, I'm sorry.  I'm terribly sorry.  Okay.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, why don't you just, you know something, just pack up now and, um, and take off.  Uh, okay.  Yeah, because it's pretty much over.  Oh, shit, dude. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  No, fuck him.  We don't have to call no one back.  Oh, he hung up.  By the way, that wasn't open.  No, that wasn't me.  That wasn't me.  It's all right.  What's he gonna do, walk in front of a bus?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Crikey.  Crikey.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened to Leonard? 
[01:35:30]  Hey, Leonard.  Oh, no.  Leonard jumped in front of a...  Oh, that was so sad.  You're fired.  Oh, poor Leonard.  Oh, you.  I think he really thought he was fired.  That's so sad.  I feel bad.  Call back.  I don't get that.  Call back.  Please call McDonald's back.  The manager will tell him he's not fired.  Nope.  Or she'll call corporate and they'll go, he's been there.  What?  Get rid of that motherfucker.  He's, he'll be fired.  I'm not gonna know.  She's probably talking to him right now.  Oh, my heart.  That was so sad.  He's probably crying.  He's like,  Oh, that was so... 
[01:36:00]  That was so sad.  What if he doesn't even talk to her and he throws himself on the grill or something?  Oh, he just starts cooking himself.  That's so sad.  Goes out like a burger.  He's got so much grease in his clothes.  He just goes up like an indoor.  Oh, poor Leonard.  Poor Leonard.  Oh.  That was pretty fucking cold.  People ask it if we're gonna be on the air tomorrow.  I don't know.  That's what I was fucking thinking, man.  Didn't that sound like something we'd get fired for?  That sounded terrible. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, come on.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Mike?  Yo, I've been listening to you guys for 12 years.  Oh, no.  And I've never, ever hit my limit.  And you just hit my limit.  You just told a retarded man who's worked for 50 years that you're gonna be fired.  Oh, that's so terrible.  And you probably will be fired tomorrow.  Oh, I hope not.  Someone on Instant Feedback just writes,  No prank calls, huh?  Hey, fuck you, Stephen King.  You enlightened us. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, fuck Stephen King.  We were inspired by Stephen King.  That's right.  Oh, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.  I hope Leonard's okay.  Will you call McDonald's?  Why won't we call McDonald's back and say Leonard was joking?  Because there's no fun in that.  Kerry, what's up?  Yeah, it's the whole thing of not knowing.  Yeah.  Kerry, what's up?  We like going through our day wondering.  Yeah.  I want to thank you guys for the years of laughter.  I've enjoyed your last program.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  I like being nervous every time the phone rings when I go home now.  Yeah, yeah.  I like the phone rings and I go, oh, shit. 
[01:37:30]  Jimmy the Creep writes, that's what I love about the O&A show.  Every show could be their last.  Oh, no.  Redding from GenericShow.com.  Leonard probably just went to his car and pulled a gun from the glove.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck balls, man.  I'm telling y'all.  I, no.  Leonard.  Oh, no.  I, no.  Paul Leonard.  Like, he thinks they light him off.  Aye, nigh. 
[01:38:00]  Aye, nigh.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Aye, nigh.  Oh, well.  What can I tell you?  Oh, well.  Larry King is checking in, Anthony.  No, I meant a Hindu because sometimes Hindus, like, protest by dousing themselves in gas and  lighting themselves on fire.  Ah, cat.  Larry.  She thought I meant Hindenburg and said it wrong.  Okay.  Gentlemen, how important are your jobs?  Oh, Larry.  Oh, Larry.  Larry, it's a strange machine from Dallas, right?  It's times like these. 
[01:38:30]  I wish you guys had a hole.  Yeah.  See, the hole would have been, oh, no, Leonard.  It's okay, Leonard.  You still have a job.  Oh, no.  Aye, nigh.  Leonard's little old mental voice was just.  Well, let's see how.  He did sound a little, like, down.  He was like, yeah.  What?  Let's see the reach of this show.  Anybody out there close to this McDonald's, you know, be a reporter on the scene.  Yeah, go there and see how Leonard is.  Where's the McDonald's?  Crestwood, Missouri?  Someone just wrote that, I bet you he just ran headfirst into the friolator. 
[01:39:00]  The friolator.  He just put his head in the friolator.  Oh, John from Virginia.  Tomorrow they're going to find Leonard hanging with the words, Leonard was here.  That's why we got the funniest listeners on the radio, motherfuckers.  Oh, shit, Leonard was here.  McDonald's redemption.  Oh, Jesus.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  I can picture Leonard riding his tricycle away in tears.  Oh, his big wheel.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, poor guy.  Oh, well.  I wish that character that I play on the radio didn't do that.  Sometimes I pass by the McDonald's I used to work at and I know I don't work there no more.  I could smell the french fries and burgers, but it's long gone.  My job's over.  I was fired the other day by some stranger on a telephone.  Life just goes too fast. 
[01:40:00]  I don't think they'll miss old Leonard much.  So I'm leaving.  I'm just going to toss this rope over this beam and clumsily kick the fucking stool out with my old man shoes.  Instead of tossing the rope over the beam, he could toss his big tongue over the beam.  And he probably has a pet sesame seed bun that he kept on his shoulder.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  What would management say? 
[01:40:30]  I have a comment.  Official comment.  You said something, though, in that, though, that actually made it make sense for me.  Yeah.  I just got fired by a stranger on the phone.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  He was talking to a radio station, and then all of a sudden the manager gives him the phone.  Susan is probably rolling right now. 
[01:41:00]  Susan isn't appreciating the fact that this guy has been there 50 years.  She's been doing all the work for 22 of those years.  That actually makes me feel better that you would actually add that.  And here's the thing that's funny.  You had to figure it out yourself.  Like, oh, shit, this is kind of dicey.  But it's like, nah, a stranger just fired you?  You fucking idiot.  It doesn't happen like that over the phone.  You know what, Leonard?  The day after his big party.  Leonard is retarded.  Leonard's stupid.  Steven asked for Bayshore again.  And I just pretend you were playing a tape of an old bit you did years ago. 
[01:41:30]  That's a good way to look at it.  She won't let him back with the food.  Huh?  She won't let him go back home.  Leonard fucks the...  He fucks the...  He fucks the fucking burger.  He's doing something.  He's doing something.  Oh, boy.  Brian and Callie.  Brian puts his dick in the McNuggets.  Brian.  Hey, how are you guys doing, man?  Good, man.  Hey, guess who was the hole on that McDonald's?  Patrice O'Neal was the hole. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Aw, a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you hear that old man?  You cruel piece of garbage.  That motherfucker went, huh?  If he believed it for a second, that retarded 50...  He's been working at McDonald's longer than I've been alive.  He had 50 years of grease under his nails.  Oh, shit.  And he thought he was fired.  They won't let him back with the burgers.  This motherfucker's a mess.  You cocksucker.  What?  Jesus, evil bastards. 
[01:42:30]  That was bad.  It was sad for a second.  That was sad.  I was getting a little sad.  I didn't say stop, but I was sad.  His voice was like, you know, oh, okay.  Okay.  I'm fired.  Okay.  Yeah, people are saying they can check out the McDonald's.  Just go and check it out and call us, please.  Yeah.  Strange machine in Dallas writes, hope you had a hell of a piss, Susan.  Fucking fast times.  That's great.  Oh, shit.  He'll probably hang himself from the arches.  That's cigars and scotch. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, man honored for 50 years of service in McDonald's and completely fucking torn down here in a matter of minutes.  The reason we called was because we were mad at the fucking owner.  When you go, Leonard, this is, you know.  I don't even remember the name.  Yeah, I'm from the main office.  Leonard said, he got happy.  And then that's when I went, fuck.  He went, yes?  Yes?  Like, this was his big, like, they finally noticed me after 50 years of service. 
[01:43:30]  I'm going to tell you what, I'm going to tell you what, they gave me balloons, they gave me a cake, but here comes the car.  He was hoping, he said the same, he had the same excitement as the guy at the bottom of the ship that was in the oil on Waterworld.  Oh, that motherfucker.  We've got about six yards of the black stuff.  Leonard thought he was going to be killed.  Yeah.  And his family would be taken care of.  Right.  He went, yeah? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah?  And then you was like, you know, there is a recession.  And he went, oh.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  That's when it started hurting.  And I'm like, don't do it.  Just don't get him emotionally.  If he had said, go fuck yourself, you're the radio guys, you would go, Leonard, and hey, oh, Leonard's on to us.  You think Leonard's might be, this is what's happening right now.  Leonard is in the back crying on top of a box of FedExed frozen ketchup packets. 
[01:44:30]  And Susan's going, they were radio guys, Leonard.  You're okay.  She's consoling this fucking asshole while her garbage is piling up.  You fucking, there's no trays left.  They're all stacked up on the fucking garbage cans.  Oh, fuck balls, man.  Oh.  Leonard's wiping his tears with that fucking jersey he hasn't taken off.  Oh, man.  You feel so fucking bad, man.  I'm going to feel bad when I leave.  That's how this show works.  In this fucking studio, I'm impervious to guilt. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, because the second I leave, I start going, why did I do that?  No, I am because this studio is filled with evil.  Yes.  And then you go outside, it's a bright, sunny day.  You see normal people, like normal human beings, and you get sucked into that whole thing.  We're getting an update.  Scott in Missouri.  Scott.  Scott.  Holy shit.  Guys, I really hope that that was fucking Leonard I just saw at the bus stop.  I'm not shitting you.  I just drove through Crestwood, Missouri.  I live here in St. Louis. 
[01:45:30]  I'm listening to you on the iPhone, so it's delayed a little bit.  Right.  As I'm driving along, just as you're saying this shit, about 150 yards down the road,  there's an old guy walking up to a bus stop in a McDonald's uniform.  No way.  I don't know if it was fucking Leonard, but I'm not shitting you.  It could have been an old fucker going to work, but if that was Leonard.  Maybe your shift's over.  Oh, no.  Really, his shift's over?  Where's he start at, 3.30 in the morning?  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Leonard.  What happened to Leonard?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He thinks we tossed him one in the freckle.  I love that we got to Patrice.  You could have seen it on his face.  Because it's just that old man went, yeah?  Yeah.  He was very excited at first.  Stay right there.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2009 coming up.  Oh.  Stay right there.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2009 coming up next on The Virus. 
[01:46:30]  Series 197.  XM 202.  Hey, it's primetime Sam Roberts, and the Opie and Anthony show is taking some time off for  the holidays.  But just because the show isn't on, doesn't mean your favorite radio disc jockeys aren't  up to something.  Follow them on Twitter and keep up with their hijinks all vacation long.  Follow Opie at Opie Radio, Anthony at Anthony Cumia, and Jim at Jim Norton on Twitter.  Enjoy your holiday.  We'll be back in the new year.  My Twitter is not Sam. 
[01:47:00]  N-O-T-S-A.  All right, I'm going.  I'm going.  M.  Hey guys, this is Sam and Eastside Dave from Special Delivery.  Welcoming all the new subscribers to Sirius XM after turning on their new radios.  Thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I love how we finish each other's sentences.  It's fun.  It's Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2009, hosted by, guess who?  Hmm, I don't know.  Sam and E-Rock.  Again? 
[01:47:30]  Yep.  On the virus.  Sirius 197 XM 202.  It's the Worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony show with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, what's this next bit?  I really have no interest, so I'll just leave it to you.  E-Rock?  You're turning off your mic.  Uh, well, you were very frustrated by this whole entire ordeal.  Uh, I believe you would call this one of your worst...  It's very surprising.  You think this is one of your worst experiences on the show, correct?  Possible.  I've never seen you react so poorly to something that you did on the air. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, it's E-Rock debuting his brand new character, which I will say he thought of himself.  No.  Oh, now your mic's back on.  No, this was Sam's creation.  Because, let me point out, while this was going on, I was in the bathroom not hearing  this, and I'd come walking out of the bathroom to Sam going, hey, you have to go in there  and do a character.  And I'm like, what?  I don't have any material.  What are you talking about?  Don't worry.  I got it.  Yeah.  And then I had to go based on what the information you gave me. 
[01:48:30]  And you said, okay, I'm going to do this.  And I said, yeah, you just go in and say, you know, I'm the virus, blah, blah, blah.  And it'll be like five minutes, correct?  Which I knew was a lie.  Well, how long did it end up being?  Much longer.  Probably 25, 30 minutes.  Well, that's how long it felt like for you, anyway.  No, I think that's actually how long it went.  Oh.  Well, it went by in a flash for me.  It was just hilarious.  I know.  I looked over, saw you crying, your face beat red, and passing a note that says, you can  do it.  Yes, I was.  I was passing you notes, but not with punchlines. 
[01:49:00]  Just notes that says, you got this.  Notes of positive support.  Yeah.  Reinforcement.  That's important.  Here it is.  The debut of somebody who we will all come to know and love.  Of somebody who I'm sure will make multiple, dozens, and dozens of appearances on the Opie  and Anthony show.  It's...  I need the mic.  The ONA...  I need the mic permanently.  Thank you.  It's the ONA virus.  The character.  It's number 10.  Here.  On the...  I need the mic. 
[01:49:30]  On your worst of the year countdown 2009.  It's the worst of 2009.  Sam's outside the studio because he's causing more problems.  He's working with E-Rock because E-Rock has to be a brand new morning show character for  us.  I mean, that radio show we were just listening to, they have Baxter, the Poker Monster.  They got Drifty.  What's wrong, Sam?  Hold on.  Hold on, Sam. 
[01:50:00]  There seems to be a problem, Sam.  What's the problem?  E-Rock is being a spoil sport.  Why?  E-Rock, go outside the studio.  Please.  I gotta talk to Sam first.  E-Rock does not look happy, Sam.  He's really upset.  What did we set up before the break?  Well, we heard from Drifty and from Baxter, the Poker Monster.  Yeah.  So you said that you guys needed a character like that, like a morning zoo type character.  Correct.  And that maybe it was time that E-Rock finally contributed something to the show. 
[01:50:30]  Finally.  That's what you guys said.  He's only been working for five years.  Jesus.  He's a veteran at this point.  And that he should, with 15 minutes notice, come up with a character and a routine.  Okay.  Right after the break.  Okay.  So I saw that we come back from break, the door opens, you come running in, because you're  just motivated all the time, Sam.  Yeah, I don't see why that's not doable.  And then E-Rock was following right behind you, and he looked miserable. 
[01:51:00]  Well, he said he's trying to get work done.  He doesn't have any material.  He doesn't have a character.  And there's no reason to do this.  So Sam came to you and said, E-Rock, I come out of the bathroom, and then he explains  what you need me to do.  Right.  I don't have any material or a character concept yet, except for what...  But you heard what we just played.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  So...  Just come up with a silly voice, a character name, and then that's it.  And go.  So I was like, all right, I'll come up with something.  And Sam goes, no, no, you got to go do it now. 
[01:51:30]  Come up with something off the top of your head.  So I'll do it.  I just didn't have anything, like, ready to go.  You don't want us to suggest it for you.  Yeah, that would be bad.  How about this?  If you don't want to come up with an idea, how about this?  He's got the idea, though.  What's your idea?  No, don't say it.  I say your name should be Blubber McGillicuddy.  And your whole thing is you're talking in a weird voice, and you try to smuggle different  chocolates in your pocket.  And you got to come in here with just your mouth full.  Yeah.  And talk about the different chocolates to make the ball funny. 
[01:52:00]  Because Drifty started his character with his mouth full.  Yeah, well, this is her to use her.  Did you come up with a character under the gun?  No, I was informed of what my character is to be.  And you got the voice?  I guess based on what was demonstrated.  I go back outside the studio.  And how do we introduce him?  Does he have, like, music or anything, Sam?  I guess Rage, right?  Street Fighting Man should be his music, I think.  Why?  Because he's representing the show.  Like, he's like the show mascot.  He doesn't deserve good walkout music. 
[01:52:30]  What's that song?  How about that fucking elephant music?  I was going to say that, too.  The elephant walk.  There.  That's his music.  What the fuck it is?  We got some humiliating music for E-Rock, is what we're getting at Travis.  We got it?  Okay, we got it.  Let me hear it.  All right, all right, all right, good.  All right, look.  We're developing as we go.  This is great.  Hold on.  Stop the music.  Because we got an intro.  Yeah.  And then the music starts, and then the radio listener gets excited, because here comes  their favorite character. 
[01:53:00]  What's his name?  They've been waiting all week for their favorite character.  What's his name?  Well, the name that Eric and I agreed upon was...  E-Rock's throwing his hands up again.  Here comes the man himself.  Well, not the man.  Here he comes, the Opie and Anthony virus.  Oh, he's like a mascot.  Yes.  Oof.  And then what do I talk to him about?  How he's infecting us with hilarity. 
[01:53:30]  All right, why don't you introduce him, Sam?  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the Opie and Anthony virus.  Oh, well, this is unexpected.  Hi, virus.  How are you this morning?  Hi, I'm the Opie and Anthony virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  Wow, that's crazy, virus. 
[01:54:00]  Jimmy, will you at least play along?  I can't look at him.  You want to start over?  No.  No.  So, virus, why don't you infect us with some hilarity?  I don't have any, because Sam didn't give me time.  That's funny.  Oh, virus sounds like an old Negro.  Oh, hey, oh.  So, what else you got, virus?  That's it, Jimmy.  Cha-cha-cha.  Oof.  Oof. 
[01:54:30]  But you didn't infect us with any hilarity.  Because I didn't have prep time.  I was in the bathroom.  But, virus, you're supposed to infect us with hilarity.  Timmy, were you infected with any hilarity?  I most certainly was not.  Oof.  His name should be Chilio.  Infecting those with douche chills. 
[01:55:00]  Do you want to go work on some material?  So, you were in the bathroom, virus?  Why don't you tell us about that?  Yeah, let's get to know virus.  Sam, stop.  Yes, Jimmy, I was in the bathroom.  Apparently, the food I ate infected me bad, because it came out as shards of red clay.  That was very funny.  That's crazy.  I enjoy a good red clay joke. 
[01:55:30]  Ted.  Yeah.  You like hilarity?  You like viruses?  I certainly do, Gregory.  He's funny.  He brings a new element to the program.  Is he infecting you with some hilarity?  He certainly is.  Yeah?  Yes.  Apparently, he stores all the viruses in his neck.  Sorry.  Well, go ahead, virus.  Ted's enjoying it.  Make Ted laugh.  Please.  Please.  I think the virus needs to go and write more material. 
[01:56:00]  That's very good.  You like that?  Yeah, I certainly do.  How about write any material?  Yeah.  Good point, Daniel.  Where's your character, Daniel?  It's a very compelling question, Mr. Virus.  Daniel, your response?  My response is I'm not the one that was asked to come up with a character, Eric.  I mean, virus.  Oh!  Doug in Salt Lake City is calling virus. 
[01:56:30]  He's got a new name.  Sounds like...  Hold on.  Sounds like Bobcat Goldweight.  Yeah, but he changed the name to Bobcat Overweight.  Fat Man Crothers.  Do we say goodbye to him now, Sam?  How does this end?  He's got more in him.  Oh, he does?  Oh, that's good to hear.  All right, virus. 
[01:57:00]  What else you got this morning?  Come on, Viri.  We heard about your shit.  No, Sam, sadly mistaken.  The virus has to go and infect others with the hilarity of the O'Brien Anthony show.  No, no, no.  There's nothing more important.  Thank you all.  No, there's nothing.  I will see you tomorrow at the same time.  No, there's nothing.  The O'Brien Anthony virus, everyone.  It's been more important than us right now because we're live.  Make sure he doesn't leave, Sam.  Virus.  Sam, make sure he doesn't leave.  Nah, he's busy.  He's got to start planning next Thanksgiving's worst, though.  You got to stay, Cyrus.  Jimmy's covering his face.  Sam's trying to hold the rock back. 
[01:57:30]  Why is virus leaving the studio, Sam?  He must want to be reintroduced.  All right.  Tell him to riff off the news.  There's a lot of stuff.  There's a lot of stuff.  Talk about John and Kate.  Plus the John Gosselin story where he took.  Riff.  Come on in.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Oh, he's willing to do this.  This is very good news.  He said he'd do it.  Yeah, riff off the newspaper.  Reintroduce virus.  Give me that, Sam.  Here.  And we got his theme music and everything.  Go ahead, Sam.  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, here to give you today's headlines with a twist, infecting us all with 
[01:58:00]  hilarity.  It's the opium antivirus.  Sam, the door's not opening.  Virus.  Here comes.  Look, another morning show's doing this.  There's an excitement when they introduce the character.  It's also scripted.  All right, Ted, you ready?  I certainly am.  I'm looking forward to this installation.  All right.  Here's the virus. 
[01:58:30]  Well, apparently a reggae star.  Oh, poor Eric.  He clubbed into the chair and it hit the sound machine like magic.  That was very funny.  Well, speaking of funny, Ted.  He's very good.  A reggae star got slashed with a samurai sword in Brooklyn.  That's a good one. 
[01:59:00]  Took my punchline.  What was the punchline?  Then he got slashed.  It was funny.  What do you mean?  I didn't mean to ruin things.  Thanks, Ted.  I'm sorry.  Go right ahead.  You go.  It's all about you.  Wait a minute.  What was the punchline?  What was the punchline, Virus?  What was the punchline again, Virus?  Bet this reggae star got slashed with a samurai sword.  That's just the facts.  You're confusing set up and punchline. 
[01:59:30]  What's the punchline?  Ted, you like that one?  That was very good.  Of course I did.  Ted's amused by the virus.  I'm not amused by the virus.  He's mysterious.  Spreads hilarity all over, Gregory.  You like that he's mysterious, right?  Yes, I do.  This man spreads hilarity.  He rips off the paper like nobody's business.  All right.  More from hilarity.  What's his name?  Virus.  He spreads hilarity wherever he goes.  Right.  He spreads hilarity. 
[02:00:00]  As a virus.  Go ahead.  We're all waiting with bated breath for the laughter to ensue.  Oh, he's looking through every page of the paper.  He probably has a dozen doozies lined up.  You're not going to find a joke in the Sudoku puzzle.  Move back toward the front.  David Letterman.  What do you got on Letterman, virus?  Well, apparently Mr. Letterman is fucking the lot of his staff. 
[02:00:30]  That's a good one.  He certainly is.  That wasn't the punchline, though.  Here comes the punchline.  Oh, go right ahead.  I apologize.  The virus has the best punchlines in the business.  Go, virus.  Here comes the punchline.  There is no punchline.  There couldn't possibly not be a punchline.  Yeah.  All right.  Now do the punchline.  Yeah.  Go.  You're a guy who likes to be on the radio.  Come on. 
[02:01:00]  Don't be afraid of outshining everybody.  He's afraid he's going to outshine us.  And the punchline to the Letterman story.  Virus.  There's no punchline.  There's definitely a punchline.  Yeah, there has to be a punchline.  Yeah.  Virus has got nothing.  What's happening? 
[02:01:30]  There's the setup again, just in case.  All right.  There's the setup again.  Apparently, Letterman.  Danny typed up the setup, so go backwards.  Maybe something will happen.  Apparently, Letterman has been effing.  I don't like to use dirty language.  Has been effing a lot of his staff.  Comedy is not my strong suit.  You're called.  You're called the virus.  Yes.  Neither is hard work or exercise.  But I'm here to promote, not to entertain.  You're called the virus where you infest us.  Spread.  What? 
[02:02:00]  Infects us with laughter.  You're supposed to spread hilarity.  Yeah, you're supposed to spread hilarity.  Hilarity.  So, start spreading.  How about some hilarity, please?  Apparently, Letterman has been effing a lot of his staff.  Go.  Yeah.  Virus.  Go.  Nothing's coming.  His face is ruby red.  He's as ashamed as he should be.  Are you embarrassed? 
[02:02:30]  Just Ted.  Dennis from Jersey suggests that by punchline, there should be a line of people just punching  him.  You got to leave us with one fucking joke.  How about this?  He doesn't have to give the virus more time.  Roman Plansky.  Roman Plansky.  Roman Plansky.  That's an easy one.  Bang the 13-year-old.  Arrested.  That's all I know.  Stop reporting.  You're not a newsman. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, stop being a newsman.  I'm not a comic either.  But your name is called...  Apparently, you are a tuberculosis patient.  Just one punchline.  Cat.  You can do it.  Go ahead.  Roman Plans.  Go.  Roman.  And go.  Go.  All right.  And you go.  How about the Olympics?  How about the Olympics?  Rio's got them.  2016. 
[02:03:30]  What do you got on that?  Virus?  Nothing!  Nothing!  Come on, Virus.  Let's have a punchline.  Let's go.  Roman Plansky.  Come on.  You say something funny.  There doesn't have to be a punchline.  There's something funny about it.  Yeah.  He likes the young girls.  Yeah.  Puts it in their butts.  Maybe make some kind of like joke about...  I don't know.  Comedy gold.  Preschool.  Yeah.  Halloween's around the corner.  Roman Plansky.  Halloween.  There might be something there.  Yes. 
[02:04:00]  Nothing.  How about he's going to dress his penis up like candy?  I think the virus's throat is closed out.  Danny, you got something to say about that?  Come on, Virus.  I think everybody does.  Danny knows why the virus is cranky, I think.  Why?  Why is it cranky?  Why, Dan?  Virus was infecting wrestling fans last night at the big pay-per-view.  What do you mean?  You went to the pay-per-view?  Sure did.  Where was the pay-per-view?  It was in Newark.  It's a Prudential Center. 
[02:04:30]  Hell in a Cell.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are you tired from Hell in a Cell there?  No, I'm fine.  All right.  Well, how about a punchline about the wrestling?  Yeah, there you go.  A little wrestling punchline.  Wrestling humor.  Here we go.  In three, two, one.  Cue the virus.  One punchline and you get to leave.  It's as simple as that.  It could just be an anecdote or an amusing thought.  Right.  It doesn't have to be a punchline.  Scott is suggesting that he'd rather have the herpes virus than listen to this. 
[02:05:00]  One punchline.  Just something amusing.  An anecdote of some sort.  We gave you some good topics.  Yeah.  Roman Polanski.  Did you hear about Roman Polanski?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we got out of trouble.  Start with that.  Yeah.  Did you hear about Roman Polanski?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Do that at least.  Did you hear about Roman Polanski?  Yes, we did.  Yeah.  What do you got on it?  Yep.  Not a lot.  Oh my God. 
[02:05:30]  He's even typing it out for you.  The setups.  One punchline.  Make Ted laugh.  You can do it.  Come on.  I have faith in you.  There's nothing I can do with this.  You're pro character.  You never break character on a morning show.  I don't recognize that voice.  No, I don't recognize that. 
[02:06:00]  One punchline.  You want to go back to David Letterman?  No.  I'd like to go back to the office.  Why does he have to call?  Because I can't.  Do you want us to feel sorry for you?  No.  And say, all right, leave?  Because that ain't happening.  One punchline.  Jimmy, you got another topic for him?  Well, we had John and K plus A.  Yeah, John and K plus A.  There you go.  A guy that has eight kids.  Took hundreds of thousands of dollars out of his wife's bank account. 
[02:06:30]  Dating again.  Dating again.  Left her with a grand.  Go.  Getting a lot of pussy out there.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Let's go, virus.  Go.  Start with, did you hear about John and K plus A?  Did you hear about John and K plus A?  No, what do you got?  Yeah, what do you got on that?  Just something amusing.  Well, you heard the divorce.  You heard he's fine from the show.  So now he's free to start dating the Octabomb. 
[02:07:00]  The music just stopped.  He just threw the microphone.  This is how it's, it's, it's, it's supposed to go differently.  Like the microphone just hung itself.  Yes.  It's the Octabomb.  One punchline.  We're only asking for one.  But that was at least in the right direction.  Tied there with another topical show.  Ted, did you like that one? 
[02:07:30]  Yes, I did.  The Octabomb was very funny, Gregory.  I'm a fan.  It's my favorite character.  I still prefer Drifty.  Are we done with the virus?  No, I say one.  I think so.  Oh, the music is back.  That means we're not done right there.  One punchline.  And we're playing a game called One Punchline.  Just give us something.  One lousy punchline.  Spread some laughter.  What else we got going on?  Yeah, what else is in the news?  Let's see.  You got some good comedy on sports? 
[02:08:00]  Baseball fan?  Virus?  Why are you looking at me?  Yeah, John clears out.  How about you don't want to do Polanski?  How about that?  How about the man arrested for filming Aaron Andrews through the hotel peephole?  There you go.  The ESPN bra.  Oh, they arrested someone.  Oh, yeah.  Who was it?  Oh, an insurance guy.  Virus.  All right, here comes the virus.  Back to the microphone. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, did you hear about Aaron Andrews?  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, what's up with that?  They arrested the guy taping her vi-  Fuck.  They arrested the guy who was videotaping her.  Yeah.  One, wow, it was a punchline.  The setup was beautiful.  Did you hear about it?  We go, what?  You got our attention.  Here we go.  One punchline.  Should we just turn off the music? 
[02:09:00]  Travis, turn off the music.  We're just looking now at a man who's remarkably ashamed.  He could possibly go home and kill himself.  That is a real possibility today.  Just do it in character.  One punchline.  What do you think of this guy videotaping Aaron Andrews?  Aaron Andrews.  Dead time to think about it.  Yeah, come on.  Peep hole.  You're the one that wanted to do this. 
[02:09:30]  You came up with the virus.  Yeah, you came up with the virus.  No, that was a Sam.  I don't know who you are.  No, that was Sam's idea.  Hey, go ahead.  I like when he talks.  He sounds gruff.  All right, right.  One punchline.  That's all we ask.  Yep.  One lousy punchline.  How about the 80-year-old man beaten during a home invasion,  then shot later in week learning about guns?  Yeah, how about that?  And go. 
[02:10:00]  Go.  What do you got?  Start with Diddy here.  You're on.  Did you hear about the 80-year-old man?  Yes, we did.  Who had a home invasion?  Yes.  What happened to him?  He was shot a week later while he was trying to learn about guns.  Yes.  What's funny about that?  It's tragic.  And here comes the punchline.  This is where you hear Jay.  They go, you want the gun? 
[02:10:30]  And then punchline.  Yeah, I think I was going to hold the gun and he shot me.  Yeah.  And here comes the punchline, playing one punchline.  Come on, you got a good one.  Perhaps he was shot trying to get into Anthony's house.  I don't even want to play anymore.  Thank you.  Ted?  What's that?  Were you listening?  Of course I was.  I enjoyed that.  You liked that one, too?  Yeah, Anthony's a drunkard.  No way.  He probably shot a virus. 
[02:11:00]  We got people that have punchlines for you.  David?  Yeah.  Hey.  Here, I got a couple.  How about the one for Letterman?  Yeah, now his intern is as late as his show.  Huh?  He fucked his intern.  Now she's as late as his show.  See?  Yeah.  I got one for the 80-year-old man, too.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right, now the old man doesn't have to wait to go to the nursing home to be abused.  Huh?  Yeah?  All right, do the Letterman one so we can get out of the bit.  You got the Letterman one?  Come on.  All right, start up Viruses music.  One punchline. 
[02:11:30]  Here it comes.  Hey, did you hear?  Letterman is fucking people he works for.  No!  Fucking people he works for.  No, that's you.  Eric is fucking people he works for.  Boy, is he.  No, I didn't hear that Letterman was fucking Les Moonves.  I'll make sure I tell Les next time I talk to him. 
[02:12:00]  So Letterman is fucking people he works for.  All right, Viruses, so what?  You tripped a little bit.  Why?  Get back on that bike.  He's so red.  He should be.  It's like he ran a marathon.  Dead.  So apparently, Letterman's been fucking a lot of his staff.  Yeah.  A lot of girls late with a period.  Yeah, that's crazy, Virus.  What do you got on that?  Here comes the punchline.  Go ahead.  So now...  Girls, he's on 1130, right. 
[02:12:30]  His interns...  He's got a period, but it didn't come on time.  Go ahead.  ...are as late as his show.  Nah, so good.  Yeah, what kind of joke was that?  No one's period is six years late.  Right.  Ever.  Kid would be like five years older, right?  No one has that type of a gestation period for semen.  He's just slamming...  Morning radio's supposed to be fun, Virus.  He should be slamming things around.  Morning...  Morning radio also has a prep service and a lot of scripting. 
[02:13:00]  Why the cough?  Virus is having a hard time breathing.  Why?  Because he's choking to two countries right now.  Are we done?  Yeah.  I missed Tank.  Yeah, where's Tank Hankerous when you need him?  Why don't you get Tank Hankerous to come barging in the studio and he drags Virus out of here?  That's a perfect ending to this.  For the old school listeners. 
[02:13:30]  They enjoy a good Tank Hankerous.  Tank Hankerous.  Sound effects.  We learned that from this fucking rock and roll morning show.  So you gotta get the door crashing open.  Come on, Tank.  Oh my gosh, look who it is!  Oh my god, this is crazy!  I had enough of this bullshit!  Tank Hankerous, everyone.  What's up, Tank?  What's up, guys?  It's been a long time.  You've been listening to the show?  It's fucking horrible.  It's horrible?  Why is it horrible, Tank?  This guy sucks ass. 
[02:14:00]  Which guy, Tank?  This character talking now and the characters I was talking before.  So I'm here to let you all guys do what you do and funny shit.  We're gonna take a break.  I'm gonna get this faggot out of here and we're gonna enjoy the rest of the show.  But what does the virus have to say about that?  Alright, I have to go.  My time is up.  And this guy is dragging me out now.  So I'll talk to you later.  Which guy?  Which guy?  Tank Hankerous.  I love his cough. 
[02:14:30]  What the fuck?  He's punching stuff.  Oh, who's he right?  Why is he punching?  I'm not lying.  Sam, go find out why E-Rock is punching stuff.  Exactly.  He just punched the listeners in the ears.  Gary in Texas.  E-Rock isn't a comedian.  Really?  We understand that, Gary.  That was the fun part of it, you dope.  You boob.  Call him a boob.  Way to get it, Gary, you boob.  Oh, no! 
[02:15:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Sex Begas.  E-Rock.  Begasy-woody-dee-do.  E-Rock.  I'm the Juggernaut.  Bitch.  E-Rock.  Bacon, bacon, bacon.  Where's the bacon?  E-Rock, you're the worst. 
[02:15:30]  E-Rock.  Sex Begas.  Stinks.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  I bring nothing to the table.  E-Rock.  Chewy, yummy, smoky.  It's bacon.  E-Rock, will you show these rookies how it's on?  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Shut up, would you?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  I'm the Juggernaut, bitch. 
[02:16:00]  Stay right there.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2009 coming up.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Welcoming all the new subscribers.  Hello.  All the new suckers.  Joining us after turning on their new XM and Sirius radios.  Describe the show a bit.  Well, it's a little bit of this, and then we do a little of that. 
[02:16:30]  And we throw in some la-la-la-las.  Thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  See, this describes it better.  Just play this.  Yeah.  2009 has finally come to an end.  And oh, what a year it was.  Not really.  It's the worst of 2009, hosted by two grown men who still watch wrestling.  Sam and E-Rock.  On the Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony show with Sam and E-Rock. 
[02:17:00]  Sam, one of the legends of rock and roll is in studio, Sharon Osbourne.  And for some reason, Bret Michaels.  Well, Bret Michaels may be offended by that comment.  He was also in a rock and roll band.  Yes, Bret's a nice guy.  But, you know, when you compare him to Sharon...  Why are you shitting on Bret Michaels?  I'm not shitting on Bret Michaels.  He was very nice.  He signed the photo of his busted lip and everything for me.  Bret Michaels, Sharon Osbourne, and Maria from the WWE on the phone. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, that's right.  All came by to talk about a charity event they were doing.  Now, however, they claim this is for no TV show that they can at least speak of.  It does not involve celebrities and maybe a position of apprenticeship.  Very well said, E-Rock.  You are a master of the English language, and that has been proven today.  Here is Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels.  And keep those ears open because Sharon shits on Susan Boyle good. 
[02:18:00]  As a matter of fact, we did a video of Sharon Osbourne shitting on Susan Boyle.  Yes, you can go to Opie Radio on YouTube and on Twitter to see that.  So here it is.  It's number nine on The Worst of 2009 Countdown.  It's The Worst of 2009.  Is this us?  Yep.  We're back live.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  And now we got Sharon Osbourne and Bret Michaels in studio.  Very busy day.  Good morning, good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  This is kind of a weird combo, the Bret Michaels-Sharon Osbourne thing.  Are you guys friends?  We've wanted this to happen for years and years. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  It's just, it's different.  That's all.  Bret's probably like, yeah, I remember she yelled at me back in 90s.  No, no, no, not true.  She shut the elevator.  We were in Wellington.  We're down in New Zealand doing a show together.  We were opening for Ozzy down there.  It was great.  They shut the door on me.  They wouldn't let me up the elevator.  I had to take like an old stairwell.  That's not true.  To the stage.  That's not true.  Yeah, shut the door.  Who's that wanker? 
[02:19:00]  Never.  But Sharon's the funniest and the best, man.  She's awesome.  Nobody fucks around with her backstage, though.  The first time I met you, you probably don't remember.  It was just a quick hello.  It was backstage.  Take probably out of that.  She doesn't remember.  Remember we smiled and took a picture?  But it was like, when you walk down the hallway, everybody just shuts the, nobody wants to say  the wrong thing.  And moved out of the way, right?  Really?  It was great to watch.  You kind of have a reputation, Sharon.  Not at all.  Can I stand up for Sharon for one minute?  Sure.  I'm just telling you this, and this is the truth.  Because I've known her for years, she is beyond funny. 
[02:19:30]  The unfunny.  I'm not kidding you.  You don't have to sell anyone on that after there's TV shows and stuff.  You just say it.  We, I tell you what, though, we have had so much fun together over these last few weeks.  And days.  Are we allowed to mention what you guys are doing yet?  Or is it still top secret?  You know no one's going to figure it out.  It's the worst secret ever.  Everyone is figuring it out.  It's the worst secret ever.  Tell me about it, but that's the rule.  They have a couple people come in from the network and beat you around the ribs. 
[02:20:00]  I'm like, I just mentioned the boom, bam, bam, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I have a feeling you guys are doing very well in this show.  But I know you can't comment, but, you know.  Unless Donald Trump is like, you know, sending the people around that.  we're always treading water though me and her heads are always can we say the chopping block  if there was to be something we were doing yeah yeah if there was a show let's just say that we

[02:34:30]  why are you here  because i have to  because you have to be controlled  you're a loose cannon  no one can control me  i'm crazy  perez hilton is a little bitch  that's true  he got punched in the face  that's true  by will im's security guard  allegedly  allegedly  but this is uh  a very funny thing  a couple  this ended up on youtube  what would tyler durden do  all over the place  it's uh  obie anthony and patrice i think was in studio that day  talking about  perez hilton  getting punched in his fat chin 
[02:35:00]  like a little bitch  that's right  and i enjoyed it  and i hope you will too  it's number 8  on the worst of 2009 countdown  it's the worst of 2009  hey uh  figure that much  where are we at there sam  let's move on to this other fucking thing  right so the much music awards in canada  and uh  perez doesn't like the black eyed peas new album  why  it's not why  what did he say  it only has like  the top two songs in america right now  so who did he draw with cum  coming out of their ears and noses  because he doesn't like the album  right  well he said fergie was fugly  really 
[02:35:30]  yeah  see if you're gonna call someone fugly  you deserve to be punched in the face  yeah man  and then you know  consequences  fugly  really  i'm sure drawing a little bit of jizz on will.i.am  and stuff like that  see  he doesn't like this new album  he said nice things about those people before  but he doesn't like this album  and he bashed it  so uh  why is he bashing an album that is like  as far as the pop world goes is  because perez doesn't like it  ugh  perez  so uh  so then  the black eyed peas came up to him at this award show  and they were like 
[02:36:00]  why are you  stop doing this  why are you  you know  insulting our album  and he was like  kind of like  i can do whatever i want  so finally  this is perez  he uh  he did a video blog  where he explains  that there was a confrontation  after the much music awards  at one of the after parties  between will.i.am of the black eyed peas  the lead singer  or rapper  and uh  perez  really  yes  i am making this  video  as mario  la vendita  that is my legal  name  what happened 
[02:36:30]  oh shut the fuck  what did you say his name was  mario la vendita  or something like that  okay  what a dramatic asshole  my legal name  what happened  to me in toronto  happened to me  as a human being  and it should not  happen  to anyone  oh  but all the things you do  to these celebrities  and the celebrities  kids by the way  that aren't even in the  fucking business  right  the whole thing  with adam sandler  but they deserve all that shit  what did he do to adam sandler  adam sandler's kid 
[02:37:00]  he used to talk about  how ugly adam sandler's kid  was all the time  oh really  did adam sandler's kid  deserve that  considering adam sandler's kid  is not in the business even  not at all  perez fucking hilton  happen  to anyone  violence  is never  the answer  ah it sure is  when it's against you  you dummy  ah ha  punch in the face  good for you  if you're gonna play that game  you gotta expect  maybe some violence  you idiot  my legal name is  barrio armando  and i have something to say 
[02:37:30]  violence is never the answer  you know what  this is it for him  he's not gonna be able  to live past this  it's embarrassing  but then he goes back  to drawing his cum bubbles  and people are gonna be like  oh okay  and fucking big dicks  in people's mouths  and things like that  people are just gonna start  punching him in the face  everywhere  oh man this is it for him  you can't just punch him  in the face  everyone's just gonna punch him  in the face  once again  my name is mario  and i was hit again  armando lavandera 
[02:38:00]  i was punched the third time  in a week  i think in the end  this destroys what he built up  why you think  because now he can't go back  to drawing cum bubbles  and fucking big huge  fucking clocks on  the foreheads of lindsey lohan  because he lost all his credibility  he loses his cum bubble  drawing credibility  because that's all he was good for  he's not saying anything  interesting with his blogs  now he can't take it 
[02:38:30]  he was taking other people's pictures  and drawing cum bubbles and shit  this is great  so how does he go back to doing that  for real  i've never seen this fucking website  it's like a tmz  yeah perez hilton  i've heard of him  wear a condom  look  show some of uh  you know  the brilliance of perez hilton  it's horrendous  he's a douchebag  adver  blood  should never be drawn  another person  should never be hit  that's why people die 
[02:39:00]  what is he babbling about  he was attacked  oh attacked  he's gotta go hard  at black eyed peas  on his website  otherwise he loses credibility  oh i don't think he will  like if he doesn't  then all celebrities know  oh i'll just go up  and punch this guy  in his head  and he'll stop fucking  drawing cocks in my ass  uh perez explains  his interaction with will.i.am  who's will.i.am  i really don't know  he's the head guy 
[02:39:30]  of the black eyed peas  oh he's the head guy  and he does production  for tons of people  he's a big star  so he's one of the main guys  because i heard he was  the manager  and he was an x-men  uh origin by the way  oh really  yeah he played  he was in a cowboy hat  yeah he played  he had a cowboy hat  nice okay  and as we were actually  getting ready to leave  will.i.am  from the black eyed peas  comes into the club  sees me  like a heat seeking missile  and comes directly  towards me  into my mouth  gay seeking missile  i need you to do me a favor 
[02:40:00]  i need you to never  write about my band  on your website again  right in my face  he was saying this  yeah  and i was like  listen  i can't make any promises  but i'll try  and then he says  why are you disrespecting me  why are you disrespecting me  and i was like  i'm not disrespecting you  and i did the whole spiel  again that i gave fergie  but it was honest  i told him  listen  you know  i love what you did  with the pussycat dolls  i love the work  that you also did  with fergie's solo album  he's like 
[02:40:30]  you need to respect me  and at that point  in my mind  i was like  you know what  i am not gonna let  this man intimidate me  and i told him  you know what  no  i don't need to respect you  i don't respect you  and that's when i  uh  made the split second decision  that i was gonna say  what i thought  was the worst possible thing  that thug  would ever want to hear  he did not  i told him  and you know what  i don't need to respect you  and you're a fag  you're gay  and stop being such a fag  and then 
[02:41:00]  i knew  come on  but i didn't want to  get into a fight  with this person  so i left  we leave  isn't it safe to say  there's one other word  that's a  that's worse  in that scenario  just a little worse  wow you're real brave  perez  you couldn't even go all in  yeah  taking the slur  that would offend  perez hilton  right  yeah  because he would offend himself  is he officially gay  officially  he's yeah  officially  super gay  officially  officially  super gay  when you say your s's 
[02:41:30]  past seven minutes  you're fucking gay  what the fuck  oh so he got all brave  and called him a fag  yeah  wow perez  wow because the guy  had a problem with  what you were saying  about him  perez is the one  who destroyed  if you call someone  a fag  guess what  you might just get  punched in the face  for that  perez is the one  who destroyed  miss california  for not supporting  gay marriage  right  this is the same guy  what a douche  jesus  always hated this 
[02:42:00]  fucking guy  i want this  my name  is  what's my name  i'm mario  armando  lavandiera  what's my name  and i need the fbi  to investigate  this hate crime  he looks like ant  yeah he does  without his makeup  look at him  perez says will's  manager punched him  yeah  so will didn't even  punch  no but he said  you know  he implied  that will had  something to do with it  we leave the club  and as soon as we leave 
[02:42:30]  there's will i am  again outside  of the club  then his manager  polo  for the ron and fez fans  okay  yeah  let's acknowledge it  sounds just like fezzy  everyone's writing  and ronnie  outside  hey  and i did not  once  ever  my name is  fez wally  and i never  got cut  one ounce 
[02:43:00]  of slack  i don't even know  if i can play  the clip now  we leave the club  and as soon as we  leave  there's will i am  again outside  of the club  then his manager  polo  whom i have met  before  from behind  comes up to me  uh oh  clocks me in the eye  right here  and punches me  two or three times  i am in shock 
[02:43:30]  i just do not know  what to do  i touch my eye  and it was  bleeding  i see my fingertips  and i'm bleeding  i think my eye  might be falling out  of my head  i'm in shock  i'm carried away  everyone's trying  to avoid a scene  so after this  happened  we leave  and we go back  to the hotel  and will i am  followed us  to the hotel  can i say something  real quick  it's just  if the word  faggot  didn't exist  you would say it 
[02:44:00]  naturally  you would invent it  listening to this  motherfucker  like  you would just go  shut the fuck up  faggot  like  it's just  it's grading  man  it's fucking  grading  it's shut the fuck  up bitch  what's wrong with  this motherfucker  man  john from north  carolina  we're making the  same point  he's on the phone  he writes  isn't his blogging  considered provoking  yes that's what  we're getting at  of course  he provokes these  guys like  like crazy  by the way 
[02:44:30]  perez hilton  was the one  news source  that uh  uh  talked about  the donald trump  buying raw incident  as if it was  real  oh really  yes he told  said it was a  goodbye for donald trump  real  so that's where  perez hilton's  coming from  yeah  yeah  and we go back  to the hotel  and will i am  followed us  to the hotel  which is where  they were also  staying  at this point  i'm freaking  out  why do they  just follow us  outside of the  club  i'm attacked  i'm bleeding 
[02:45:00]  and they're  following us  back to the  hotel  i called the  police  what even though  gaga had a  bodyguard  what if one of  these people had  a gun  oh stop it  so this whole  thing broke  it's not like  the carry  con  oh  this whole thing  broke because  on perez hilton's  twitter before  any of this was  posted  it just said  things like  please help me  call the police  for me  i'm at the  hotel  what why  so he's tweeting  less time  to push 
[02:45:30]  9-1-1  he's tweeting  for the police  he's trying to  explain that  because  will i am  tweet the police  instead of  or tweet  that he needs  the police  instead of  just calling  9-1-1  because he's  looking for  publicity  but will i am  put up a video  right away  and said  you know  first of all  he was tweeting  he was like  second of all  it wasn't  it was just  some random  fan that  punched him  like will i am  said all this  and some random  guy punched perez  and perez said  no it was  will i am's 
[02:46:00]  manager  but how does  he know  that's the  dispute  he said it  was definitely  polo  we got some  we got  kevin in  florida  kevin  i'm just  waiting for  the part  of the video  where he  says that  he sold  crack cocaine  in a limousine  to senator  obama  he does  sound like  that guy  crack cocaine  for his use  powdered cocaine  for mine  for mine  i gotta remember  that exact quote  i then had  oral sex  with mr  obama  jesus christ 
[02:46:30]  that was  in gurney  yeah  in gurney  right here in  gurney  we were in a hotel  in gurney  gurney  where are ya  uh perez explains  what happened  when he called  police  then starts  crying  oh no way  oh he starts  crying big time  oh this rules  i called 9-1-1  i spoke to the  police and they  explained to me  that you know  they would try  to make it  but that there  were actual  emergencies going  on 
[02:47:00]  that's what  happened when i  called 9-1-1  because i had a  flat tire  yeah  excuse me  it's not real  fix it yourself  but i'm in the  woods  and there's a  guy with a  mask  a hockey mask  on  don't bug us  bitch  hey  what's the  mainstream media  on  whose side is  like you know  the mainstream  media on  like  oh they'll  leak this shit  up  yeah  like but are  they saying  will.i.am is a  dirty bastard  or are they  on perez  will.i.am hasn't 
[02:47:30]  been vilified yet  because nobody  can concretely  say who  punched him  i think he  just this  friggin perez  hilton looks  like an idiot  in this whole  thing  can i tell  you like  mario  black eye  black eye  peas or  black eye  black eye  peas  they're smart  enough to know  they got a  beef with  perez hilton  right  you know  damn well  that you  know will.i.am  can't punch  nobody  of course not  so they have  the confrontation  that will.i.am 
[02:48:00]  goes you know  and one of  his uh  one of his  entourage type  guys one of  his one of  his guys that  hangs around  goes all right  and then  punches him in  the face  three times  they'll never  know who  punched perez  hilton in  the face  and it's  perfect because  perez knows  exactly who  punched him  in the face  one of his  guys  there you  go  you know  what they  should have  people  those guys  know how to  take care of  their shit  they probably  have people  that are  punch in  the face  people  absolutely  it's like  you're a  punch in  the face  guy  if i'm  talking to  somebody  dude it 
[02:48:30]  was you  come up  and just  punch him  in the  face  i don't  know you  you get  money under  the table  you never  talk to us  will i have  had a one  minute conversation  with someone  and he didn't  even say  punch him  in the face  but this  guy knew  i gotta go  punch him  in the face  a little  peripheral vision  look  this is what  happened  and the guy  just gave him  a nod  and that was  it  punch him  in the face  emergency is  going on  but i was  in fear  for my  safety  and i had  been  assaulted  so when 
[02:49:00]  the police  are taking  their time  and they're  not coming  i'm freaking  out  i took to  twitter  because i  was in  shock  because that's  the first place  you go  yeah i took  to twitter  after that  it's not like  you're in the  middle of a  cornfield in  the middle  of nowhere  and you're  like oh  fuck there's  no phones  around but  i got my  twitter on  me  you're in a  hotel and  you can call  on a phone  or the phone  you got in  your hand  what does  he have  like he  probably  has what  two million  fucking  followers  or something  right  but i want  to know  if anybody 
[02:49:30]  called the  fucking  cops  well he  thanks the  people  who did  indeed  call  because you  know they're  idiots who  probably woke  up the next  morning 12  hours after  it happened  oh my god  help him  oh my god  someone's  meeting up  for res  and lady  gaga  who the fuck  is lady  gaga  lady gaga  she's the it  girl right now  why do you  think it  rained so  hard last  night that  was all  of perez  hilton's  fans crying  alongside  i felt 
[02:50:00]  helpless  and that  was my  very public  cry for  help  and to all  of those  people who  expressed  concern  and who  called the  police  let's invent  a new word  for faggot  let's invent  a new word  from the bottom  of my heart  thank you  because i  am a human  this ruins  him  he's a  twaggot  twaggot  see this 
[02:50:30]  guy  he's a  twag  this ruins  him  this ruins  what he was  what he was  building up  shut the fuck  up twag  because then  he realizes  wow  everyone realizes  out there  wow this guy  isn't as brave  as we thought  like you know  the whole point  of like if you  make fun of  everybody  you have to be  somebody that  people can't  make fun of  right  but now he's  like obviously  vulnerable  he's so vulnerable  he's a twag  this ruins him  i'm telling you  six months from  now his site  is nothing  he'll get some 
[02:51:00]  he'll get some  nice exposure  and buzz  the next week  or two  after that  people gonna  be like  this is  was his twitter  right there  i was assaulted  by will  i was assaulted  he shouldn't  put that up  there because  i got the  i got the  whole line  of twitter  oh you do  in a second  that's  that's like  the third  one in  oh is it  yeah because  i'll give you  the whole  development of  this thing  right after  this clip  it's almost  over  no one  deserves  to be  treated that  way  you do  violence  is never  the answer
