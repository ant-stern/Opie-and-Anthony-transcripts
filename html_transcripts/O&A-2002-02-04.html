<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, following the Super Bowl, opened with a celebratory atmosphere fueled by numerous calls from elated Boston Patriots fans.  The hosts recounted their own post-game revelries, detailing a drunken car ride back from Boston involving near-ejection of Jim Norton.  A significant portion focused on a previous show's "puke fest," where listeners consumed another listener's vomit to win Super Bowl tickets; audio and video of this event were promised online.  The "Naughty Nighty" contest winner was announced.  Listener Murph, the initial Super Bowl ticket contest winner, admitted to selling his tickets and subsequently engaging in drug use and soliciting escorts.  Callers shared their own often intoxicated and outrageous post-game experiences, including one callerâ€™s arrest for streaking.  This was followed by a contest where listener Jesse won Super Bowl tickets by eating a concoction of clam chowder, human vomit, and ground-up toenails from a previous guest, "Stalker Patty."  Jesse detailed the disgusting taste and texture.

The broadcast continued with calls from Big Mike promoting "Slim Goodies," and updates on the "Naughty Nineties" photo contest.  Scott Pharrell called in, describing his heavily intoxicated Super Bowl party, prompting an angry reaction from a Boston caller.  A heated, highly offensive argument erupted between Old Dirty Bastard (ODB) and a new co-host, "Frenchie," filled with homophobic and racial slurs.  Caller Tom further fueled the conflict with similarly offensive language.

Studio guest Laura Korn, a sex advice columnist and author of "The Great American Sex Diet," discussed her book and participated in a "Name That Spice" game where she described sexual positions.  The show revisited the Naughty Nineties contest, highlighting a woman's cross-country trip for a reshoot and the appearance of WOW stickers in CNN's Boston Super Bowl coverage.

A substantial portion of the show involved graphic discussions of sex, including explicit descriptions and jokes about sexual acts, like the invented "Kitty Popsicle," and solicitations for listeners to try it.  The hosts and Jim Norton engaged in crude discussions about sexual stamina and the G-spot, with numerous callers sharing personal anecdotes and seeking advice. Laura Korn further promoted her book and other sex-related products and videos.  A shocking story was revealed about Laura's deceased former assistant, Meg, who allegedly stole a man's sperm and became pregnant, resulting in a lawsuit against Laura.  This led to Godfather impressions.

Dice Clay called in, recounting a bizarre lawsuit involving a woman, her assistant, and the theft of his semen, using vulgar language. The conversation remained intensely sexually explicit, with Dice boasting about his sexual prowess.  The discussion returned to Laura Korn, who, along with several couples, participated in an on-air demonstration of sexual acts detailed in her book, including graphic descriptions using euphemisms like "kitty popsicle" and "popping her clutch." The couples provided feedback. Frenchie participated, doing a Dice Clay impression.  Listener calls followed, sharing reactions and further explicit sexual discussions. The show repeatedly promoted Korn's book and website using the number 1-800-547-BONK, and the Naughty Nighting contest on opianthony.com, featuring Kristen, who drove from Cleveland for a photo shoot.

And the Patriots are Super Bowl champions.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  8-7-7-6-9-2-1-0-2-7. 
[00:02:00]  Anywhere else, including.  Yeah.  Do I have to tell you today?  I got him.  Boston!  8-6-6-2-7-7-4.  Wow.  Keep it down a little, O.P.  That's 8-6-6-2-7-7-4.  Wow.  Your enthusiasm is really great and all, but I am hurting so bad today.  You haven't slept yet, huh?  I guess you could call it sleep.  Some type of semi-consciousness. 
[00:02:30]  I watched the game.  Went to a Super Bowl party.  Did you actually watch the game?  Oh, yeah.  I watched the game.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Johnny Race.  Went to my brother-in-law and sister's house.  You know rock and roll, Johnny.  I know him well.  Wow.  Of course.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll with his goddamn jello shots.  And Jack Daniels and the lemon drops.  You could always just say no.  Just say no. 
[00:03:00]  No, no, no.  Just say no.  He doesn't go away.  Just say no.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just say no.  At the Super Bowl party, you got to, like, get hammered.  I guess.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Cool.  But I'm kind of a little hurting today.  And the Patriots are Super Bowl champions.  And let me tell you, I called it.  Oh.  I got to make sure people realize that my sports curse is over.  Uh-huh.  I called the Diamondbacks.  I have called the Patriots now, my friend. 
[00:03:30]  There you go.  The whole sports thing is heading in the other direction.  Congrats.  All right.  And congratulations to our band.  Our own band.  Ben.  From Boston.  Ben.  He's wearing his, he's wearing his, uh, BCN, uh, Patriots.  That's right.  That's right.  The Patriots.  Fleece.  Fleece that he got.  That we all got after the puke fest on Friday.  Two days in a row.  Oh, yeah.  You don't seem too drunk.  I do.  I was way too into the game.  I was just real crazy into the game.  And then, uh, I was invited to probably eight Super Bowl parties. 
[00:04:00]  No way.  I watched it with, uh, two diehard Pats fans and one other guy.  Yeah.  That was it.  Right in front of the TV.  Wow.  No parties.  No, a little.  I mean, I met up with Mark after the game.  Nothing too crazy, though.  Man, we're just in, it's the first time Boston's had a championship since 86.  You don't gotta, like, don't gotta say anything to us.  We know.  I, I think, uh, I think you were hungover from the, the trip home from Boston.  That's why you didn't drink much yesterday.  Holy, yes.  Where's Steve from FoundryMusic.com?  We all met up Saturday. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Uh, before heading back to New York and we went and got some, uh, some grub in Cambridge.  Grub.  And then we, uh, jumped in our, our rides and made the trip back home to New York.  And, uh, how hammered was Ben on the, on the way home?  Could not speak.  What I did was, wow.  I filled up the big, uh, the big Coke soda cans with some of that rum we had brought.  Oh, God, that's the worst.  It made a great ride home, though.  I got home and just passed out.  Got tons of sleep for yesterday.  Not some of the rum we had got.  We, we had bought all of the rum. 
[00:05:00]  No, no, no, no.  Sneaky, Sneaky was in on that, too.  He was?  I didn't realize.  Well, he wasn't, he wasn't slurring.  And all I know is when I, I kicked Norton out of my car, because I was going a different  direction.  Right.  And put Norton in Steve's car for the, the last leg of the trip.  You were so effing gone.  You were staggering.  You had a bottle of rum in your hand and you wanted to throw it.  Yeah.  Well, and the other thing was.  What was left of the bottle of rum?  Yeah.  And then also you guys with all your little practical jokes along the ride.  Oh, stop at this stop.  And then you guys don't stop.  And, uh, well, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  You can't trust these guys on a trip anywhere.  They stop and they don't stop.  What are you talking about?  Oh, wait a minute.  We don't even, what are you talking about?  We explained to you what happened.  What happened?  Well, I don't know.  Have, we can't believe much of what these two say, because it was like a battle of cell  phones going all the way back from Boston to New York, because we were like just pranking  each other the whole way, all the way back.  Oh, pull over, pull over.  We're going to give you Norton.  Oh, you kidders.  We needed some gas and we, we told you to pull over on the Mass Pike and, uh, we kept 
[00:06:00]  going.  What's the big deal?  Kidders.  Yeah.  And then when it happened to Connecticut, well, and then, yeah, but you guys pulled over  in the middle of nowhere.  It wasn't even a rest area.  I hate getting off the highway.  Oh, I know.  I will not get off a highway if I'm road tripping.  Stay on the road.  Stay off the moors.  Never get off of the effing highway.  Never get off the effing highway.  So you guys got off somewhere in Connecticut to get him more soda for the rum or something?  No, no, no.  Well, no, to get gas.  He just happened to, just happened to be at the end.  This is as confusing as the ride sounds. 
[00:06:30]  It really is.  I know.  But the point I was trying to make was that Ben was completely gone.  You and your wacky practical jokes.  Just driving home.  I'll tell you what I did to Rick.  Rick wanted to stay in my room because I was leaving Friday night, and he was staying  in my hotel room.  So I took pretzels and cracked them all in the bed.  There were just crumbs filling up the bed.  And I left a wake-up call before in the morning.  Nice.  Before I left. 
[00:07:00]  The funny thing is that Rick passed down on top of the covers.  I passed down on the bed, so I never, like, got under the covers.  So I never knew about that.  But then he mentions the 4 o'clock wake-up call.  I'm like, you did that?  And then I'm like, oh, I remember the phone ringing.  But it was just like a haze.  I remember the phone ringing, going no, and I clicked, and the lights were still on.  Then I was pissed because I forgot to take the Snickers bar, wet it, and mold it into  a big turd and stick it, like, on the toilet rim.  So when you open it up, there's a big load of crap there, it looks like.  Speaking of gags, Lynch was trying to call Earl's room hookers at, like, midnight. 
[00:07:30]  Unfortunately, they didn't believe, they figured out that it wasn't Earl calling.  Hey, did Lynch, he got his car out?  Because I know Earl took his parking ticket.  Yeah, yeah, he had no problem.  Really?  Yeah, that was Earl's big get-back for stealing his shoes.  Lynch stole Earl's shoes, and Earl lost his effing mind about it.  So Earl stole Lynch's parking ticket, thought him to get his car out of the garage, and  the guy just goes, no, no, I'll just give you another parking ticket, no problem.  I heard that Earl also was going to take Lynch's car keys from his right pocket and put them 
[00:08:00]  in his left pocket.  You trickster.  Awful practical joke that was.  But that puke show on Friday was amazing, and Boston kicked our ass, and here we are back  in New York.  I want to know what happened to the people.  Oh, now, you remember Murph was the first winner of the Super Bowl tickets.  Right, he was the one that ate the most chowder without puking.  Right, that was pretty much the first contest before it really got out of hand and disgusting. 
[00:08:30]  And just in case you missed the grand finale of Friday's show, I got it right here in CD  number three for you.  Oh, fantastic.  Guys eating puke for Super Bowl tickets.  Let me go to a few phone calls while we get Murph on the line to see how his trip to New  Orleans was.  Maria, what's going on?  I just wanted to know, guys, is Stinky going to kill himself live on the air, or is he going  to do it in private?  Stinky!  Yeah, Stinky is not a happy camper.  Yeah.  Well, you know, he's got to take it like a man now. 
[00:09:00]  What did Stinky say to you?  He said he was going to jump in front of a bus, right?  He had said on January 3rd at 1.33, that if they just merely got in, that he would kill  himself, and he discussed how you would kill yourself, and, uh...  Kill yourself.  Die, die, get in the coffin.  How bummed are you today, Stinky?  Well, I kind of bet the Pats.  Oh, you're dead.  God bless you.  I was hoping for the Rams, like a three-point win by the Rams or something, because I knew  the Pats wouldn't lose by that 14th. 
[00:09:30]  So you bet the Pats, and now you're going to die, and you can't spend your money.  Exactly.  What was the line in that game?  How many points at the end there?  Fourteen and a half.  Fourteen and a half.  Nice bet.  Nice.  And how much are you making, man?  A hundred bucks.  Not a hundred?  Forty.  That's tidy.  All right, Maria.  No, there's a spread in football.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey, Cheryl, the Jamaican girl.  Hello.  My T-1.  You were rooting for the Pats?  Yeah, I was rooting for the Pats. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  What I'd like to sign up, is there any liquor left in Boston today?  I think she said, is there any alcohol left in Boston today?  Yeah, I was trying to figure out what she said.  I doubt that.  I don't think a lot of people went to work today in the Massachusetts area.  No, no.  A lot of people celebrating all last night and all day today.  You know what I love about the guys is that most people are saying that they weren't going  to win.  Yeah.  And they just went out there and played their hearts out.  Yeah.  And I just love that about them.  Played their hearts out. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you, Brady has no fear, man.  The guy's unbelievable.  They played a great game.  The guy was just playing cool.  And you see, what I love is that they introduced him as a team.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go, Boston.  That was Belichick's idea.  A great coaching job by him.  One of the best in NFL history, you've got to think, at this point.  Yeah.  Enjoy it, Boston.  All right, Cheryl.  Okay, bye.  Peace.  Someone on line three here, Matt from Boston.  Matt, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:11:00]  What's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  I think Madden was an idiot for saying, like, about two minutes left in the game, he was  saying they should kneel down and go into overtime.  Oh, he is out of his mind.  And then he was backtracking and he admitted he was wrong.  Yeah.  Jackass.  Brady has proven in the last few weeks before the Super Bowl that, you know, he could march  down the field.  Exactly.  At least he admitted he was wrong, though.  Did he?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Yeah, he admitted it.  Why say in the first place?  He took it back. 
[00:11:30]  You got balls out and you try to win the goddamn game.  You got a minute and a half.  See what it's all about.  You got a minute and a half before overtime.  You got the ball.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Let's see what we can get done.  Get into field goal range.  Big time Jets fans, guys.  And I'm jealous as hell that Belichick couldn't have done it with the Jets.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, good point.  Manny, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  We are loving it here in Boston today.  How's the hangover?  Amen.  My hangover sucked at work, but it's getting better now. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  No one slept last night.  No one.  No, it was insane.  I was hammered by kickoff.  Right.  But, I mean, I just want to say, man, for everybody that overlooked the Pats, and the Rams especially,  because even the Rams after the game, it seemed to me like they still weren't getting the Patriots enough credit.  Who cares?  Hey, I know.  It doesn't matter anymore, because we won the Super Bowl.  But I just want to say, Stinky, don't jump in front of a bus just yet.  The Bruins are in first place, too, man.  All right.  Yeah, Stinky's out there answering calls.  So, if you're from Boston, you know, let Stinky hear it, all right? 
[00:12:30]  All right, man.  Hey, and tell Pharrell, he's a sock.  Pass all the way.  Yeah, we're going to try to wake up Pharrell.  He's passed out.  Oh, sure.  Because he had a really long night, too.  Yeah.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, Joe.  Calling from Boston.  Cash rule.  You guys suck, man.  I love you guys.  I just want to rub it in Pharrell's face.  You guys going to have him on tonight?  You know, I think we should have him on one last time, and then, you know, we'll take a break with the Pharrell thing.  But I think he has to, you know, show his face today. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, I think he definitely has to.  He did some hot.  You know, he was cool.  You know, he admitted he was wrong with the Pittsburgh thing, but...  Dude, he bet the Pats.  Yeah, I know, I know.  He bet a lot of people are, huh?  Yeah.  That's very cool.  But, yeah, I just wanted to say that he was a big man, and he went the right way with it.  And the Pats just rule, you know?  The face is exploding.  Well, yeah.  People are turning over cars in Boston last night, you know, and it was wild.  That's nice. 
[00:13:30]  That's just a regular night in Salby.  Yeah, exactly.  Flip them cars over.  You guys suck.  All right.  Hello, local reference.  Thank you, Joe.  Let's go to Ryan.  Phones have just exploded.  Ryan, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to go and say how the Pats killed it this year.  You know, they really started out on a bad note, and, you know, I mean, for Tom Brady to  step in like he did, I mean, to be so young and...  And new fire.  Put it together for his team, you know what I mean? 
[00:14:00]  All right, Ryan.  Well built.  Congrats to you guys.  Look at Junius here from Washington, D.C.  That bad...  Too bad the vomit-eating bit was fake, guys.  There's no way the powers that be would allow that stunt.  I thought you guys kept it real.  What an...  Junius.  You're no genius.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Jack.  Douche.  Get Steve in here from FoundryMusic.com.  Go to FoundryMusic.com.  Don't we have clips?  We have video.  What do you think that was?  Industrial light and magic?  People making like they're vomiting in front of a blue screen and then superimposing them 
[00:14:30]  with computer graphics, Jesus Christ, they were vomiting.  They were eating vomit.  Steve.  What?  You have clips of the puking up on FoundryMusic.com?  Yeah, there's one clip right now of Kyle puking.  I really have to take my time editing this stuff.  It's difficult to look at.  But it is really, really powerful.  But we got Kyle's puking so far.  Yeah, there's Kyle's puking and there's more to come.  There's Amy's puking and then there's Murph's puking and then there's the three guys that  were eating the puking.  Eating the puking.  That is going to be, you've got to let us know when the clips of the guys eating puke 
[00:15:00]  is up on the side, all right?  It's going to be up tonight.  It's just difficult to really go through that all again.  All right.  Yeah, you guys were right there.  We got it.  Michael, what's up?  I just want to thank you guys.  You sick eppers made me puke on Friday on the way home.  I literally, I pulled over and puked and almost got rear-ended.  You sick eppers.  One of the most disgusting programs we ever put on.  Yeah.  How did you get to sleep that night?  I would have flashbacks for a month. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, it was disgusting.  I slept like a baby.  Yeah, Norton.  God.  That stuff doesn't bother me at all, actually.  No, it makes me laugh so hard.  It is fun.  I feel like I need my appendix taken out or maybe I'm having a heart attack.  That's the reaction I get from stuff like that.  I laugh so freaking hard.  Oh, God.  So I'm going to send you the bill for the cleaning of my car.  All right, Michael.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  I just watched the Kyle Puke video.  Really? 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  Does it look fake, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Completely fake, right?  Jackass.  All right.  Let's go to Murph.  Murph!  Here he is.  Yee-yee!  All right.  Here's the deal.  Let me just explain to everyone.  Murph was the guy that finally won the Chowder Bowl, Anthony.  Yeah.  Who were you up against?  Amy, right?  Yeah.  Amy choked on what she said was a potato, and then it caused a gag reflex, and then she  lost her lunch.  Yeah.  And then Murph won the Super Bowl tickets.  You were really, really hammered during the show Friday. 
[00:16:30]  I haven't stopped drinking yet.  So I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things, Murph.  Yeah?  I'm hearing that you might not have made it to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.  I barely made it out of Boston, to be honest with you.  I was able to hawk the tickets, we'll say.  You sold the goddamn tickets.  Yes.  All right.  Well, take us through it.  After the show, what did you do?  All right.  I called up a couple of my buddies.  Yeah.  And I wound up finding a kid that would give me 800 bucks, and I will say a half pound of 
[00:17:00]  marijuana.  A half pound?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a lot of pot.  Yeah, homegrown.  So then I traded some of the pot for some other legal substances.  Coke?  You better believe it, buddy.  And then a couple of Zannies.  Look at us supporting terrorism.  A couple of Zannies.  We're indirectly supporting terrorism, Anthony.  I learned that with one of those Super Bowl commercials last night. 
[00:17:30]  With the pregame, we ordered two escorts before the game.  You did?  Just to loosen the mood around.  So all this because you won the Super Bowl tickets from your pals Opie and Anthony, right?  Opie and Anthony, you have made this the best weekend of my life.  And paid for his whores and his dope.  Yeah.  Why don't we just give out whores and drugs next time?  It would have been easier.  Eliminate the middle man.  All right.  Well, all right, Murph.  Sounds like you had a good time. 
[00:18:00]  What the hell?  Hey, excellent time.  Hold on, hold on.  I think I got a clip of you winning the whole thing.  Hold on a sec.  Here's Murph from Boston.  All right.  Let's go to Mike on line seven and talk to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, she's under the table.  Oh, look at what.  She's under the table.  Murphy's on top of the table in victory.  Murphy goes to the Super Bowl.  Well, so we thought. 
[00:18:30]  The party hasn't stopped, so don't worry about it.  I turned this place into New Orleans last night.  Yeah, that's the clip, obviously, of Amy completely losing it.  All right.  Can't believe he didn't go.  Well, congrats, Murph.  You had no intentions of going?  Is it fair to say now?  After I left, I was too drunk, really, to probably manage my way down there.  Yeah.  So you and your buddy there figured out a plan B, huh?  A plan B, and it worked out pretty well.  All right, Murph.  Well, congrats. 
[00:19:00]  Thank you very much.  There he goes.  Murph from Boston.  Yeah.  Jay Moore checking in.  Show's moving a mile a minute.  Jay.  Yeah, baby.  Title town.  What's up, Jay?  Title town.  That's what's up.  Boston is title town.  Yeah, they're celebrating today.  I think that's your next giveaway.  O.P. and Anthony, drugs and hookers.  Drugs and hookers.  That's pretty much the prize we gave away.  And then you know what?  You give away drugs and hookers to keep the fans happy, because we all know, and I'm not 
[00:19:30]  even joking.  You guys know.  It's all about the fans.  Right.  Of course.  And then you give away coke and hookers to the next winner, and then you guys get in  trouble.  Yeah.  You got a big bag of dope up there.  You got a couple of hooves.  The guy got dope, blow, and escorts.  Escorts.  How great is that?  I was there with my dad, and good God, after you two got off, I cried until like the halfway  through the third quarter.  Oh, yeah?  That was pretty impressive.  And you know what?  I was in the restroom after the game, and all the Pats fans were just dominating the Superdome. 
[00:20:00]  It was unbelievable.  And all you saw were like a bunch of like, kind of faggy 13 jerseys.  These guys are walking around with their heads down like, and some guy behind me goes,  Foxborough, no more faking aluminum seats.  Yeah, they got the new stadium next year.  No more aluminum seats as it's added.  Bring it, Jay Moore.  Let's select the game. 
[00:20:30]  What do you think of the game, Jay?  I think if name it didn't say, I guarantee it, that would have been the greatest Super  Bowl of all time.  That was an amazing Super Bowl.  You felt the momentum changing that.  Oh, it got spooky.  And it's only that white guy, Ricky Troll.  That's why they had him watch down the field, because, I mean, the Rams had all the momentum  at the end of that quarter, man.  I would have given MVP to Vinny Thierry, man.  I don't know what the heck was going on.  Solid.  That's how you kick a field goal, Buffalo.  There you go.  Oh, hey, get off of Buffalo. 
[00:21:00]  That's what I was thinking, though, because I was up in Buffalo for that nightmare, and  I'm thinking, oh, my God, this is kind of like the Scott Norwood thing, but right down  the middle.  Boom!  That's Adam Ice.  Adam Ice.  When I was interviewing the Patriots, Jermaine Wiggins was a little, I think he was enjoying  Bourbon Street.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Up until the moment I saw him, actually.  And he looked at me, and he said, oh, Adam Ice.  And I went up to Adam Vinny Thierry, and I said, hey, I'm here with Adam Ice. 
[00:21:30]  He goes, I like that.  I like that.  Where'd you get that?  I'm like, uh, your teammate just made it up.  So it's nice to know you guys all talk to each other.  But, uh, when he nailed that field goal, I might have traded, for a moment, I thought  of this, I might have traded being in the Dome just to be at a pub in Southie when that  thing split the up.  Oh, forget it.  What did you imagine?  People hugging, falling on the ground, and vomiting.  Yep.  Well, that was our show Friday.  How did the clam chowder work out? 
[00:22:00]  It was the sickest, most disgusting program we've ever done.  Jay, are you still in New Orleans?  Yeah, I was supposed to get on, like, the big multi-million charter for Fox.  Right.  I just couldn't wake up.  All right, here's the deal.  Tune in the show after the commercials.  We're going to play.  We got four clips of guys eating puke for Super Bowl tickets.  Eating puke.  What?  Yeah, after some of the people.  It was the grand finale of Friday's show.  After some of the people puked from eating the clam chowder, we got some more Super Bowl  tickets, so we invited in some listeners that were outside to go one for one, spoonfuls 
[00:22:30]  of vomit, until there's a winner left standing.  It turned out, first guy to hold the puke down won a pair of tickets to the Super Bowl.  Got to hold it down for a minute.  Was it their own vomit?  No.  No.  Other people's vomit.  Stinky?  Yeah.  Stinky's in the studio.  Stinky had to go into the dumpster to find a bag of puke.  It was Kyle's puke, is what it was.  Well, the first guy to puke when we were doing the chowder bowl, Jay, he lost his lunch 
[00:23:00]  for, I don't know, it was well over a gallon of fluid came out of this kid.  Disgusting.  Into a small, you know, wastebasket, and they tied up the puke and they threw it right  away.  Stinky had to go into the dumpster and find that puke so we could do the grand finale.  Gentlemen, you are pioneers.  Yes.  Yes.  Steve Allen hosted the Tonight Show.  This is exactly what he envisioned would happen.  Of course.  Marconi saw this.  You've got to hear this audio we're going to play right after the break.  It's hilarious. 
[00:23:30]  The guy vomiting all over the place?  Yeah.  It's really funny.  And, Jay, Budweiser ripping off your satin sheet joke.  What?  The commercial.  Did you see the Budweiser commercial?  I was in the dormant.  Oh, it was the monkey in the beginning.  The wife's upstairs trying to entice the husband or the boyfriend or whatever to come up for  a little nookie.  And she said, you know, she's got the satin sheet, she's got the lingerie on, and finally  she says, you know, I got Budweiser.  He comes running up the stairs, taking his clothes off as he's running up the stairs  and jumps into bed and goes flying across the satin sheets out the window. 
[00:24:00]  Well, gentlemen, my next call is to Debbie Klein.  Klein time.  The best lawyer in the world.  There you go.  Who also happens to represent a little group called U2.  I can't believe that.  I'm usually the one stealing from everybody else.  Well, I'm glad you said it because I was about to.  I think you're doing the silver, bitch.  You said, no bar in aluminum seats.  There's going to be a lot of beatings in Southie today, guys.  Oh, yeah.  There's going to be a lot of deaths by alcohol and a lot of hungover guys going, Gina, make 
[00:24:30]  me coffee.  Hey, dude, and the halftime show rocks for once.  U2 was awesome, wasn't it?  It was so unbelievable to be there.  When they did the list of names, I recognized two names from Rescue 1, and I was sitting next  to my dad, and I just saw my dad crying, and then it was over.  Yeah.  And then, I don't know if you noticed this, but they were going alphabetically.  They only got to the C's.  Oh, I know.  Well, they did that same type of thing when they played the Garden, and the list of names 
[00:25:00]  went on for almost three songs.  It got more painful every second that went by, and more names going.  You go, like, it's got to end soon, and it just doesn't.  Right.  Oh, gentlemen, that was the greatest of all.  But how do you get MVP with 145 passing yards?  Well, because...  I mean, he did make no mistakes, and that's great, and I love Tom Brady.  He got it done when it counted, right at the end there.  I agree.  I just don't want Chowd jumping on the track.  Brady's the greatest.  How could you say that?  You're retarded.  But I just thought Adam Ice, man, come on, Chowd, step up. 
[00:25:30]  Co-MVP.  Adam could drive Tom Brady around in the new Cadillac he won.  Yeah, the co-MVP would have made sense, sure.  I thought for sure it was going to be Adam and Vincieri.  But you know what?  Now I'm laying here, and I got the talent to myself at least for a little bit,  so maybe I'll actually go enjoy an actual...  Everyone told me I had to eat when I got down here,  but after you talked about all the goddamn clam chowder vomiting...  You know what?  I'm going to go out and order clam chowder and hold it down just because I'm a man. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Just because I'm a man.  All right, Jay, we've got to let you go.  This show is way too fast.  Oh, I'm sorry, guys.  It's cool.  God bless you guys.  Good talking to you.  I'll be back in L.A. late tonight, and we'll get together later in the week.  I've got to hear all this stuff.  You guys are on fire.  Just straighten out the breast and see town.  Yeah, it's getting better.  All right.  We'll explain the Naughty Nighty thing soon.  Explain that.  You know, I'm not going to say anything.  I'm not going to say who, what, where, numbers, or nothing.  I'm being very honest.  I'm not going to say a word.  But we have a winner. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, number 37 from Washington, D.C.  You reject.  Just go there now.  Number 37.  Go win the Naughty Nighty contest.  You guys know that's my lucky number?  I was pushing for Bobby from Philly, but, man, Stephanie did a reshoot.  What did you look like?  With an I.  Stephanie from Washington did a reshoot.  Number 37.  Go check her pictures out now.  She is too hot for this contest.  37 is my lucky number.  That's unbelievable.  That's my middle league number. 
[00:27:00]  Get near a computer.  Let me tell you something.  You go to number 37, Stephanie's reshoot.  The first picture.  The first picture is going to put her over the top.  And then the last picture of the second set, because she's got a second outfit that we just had to get on the OF site.  The last picture of the second set.  If that isn't, if you don't have your junk in your hand and moving it very quickly to this picture, you're a faggot.  So, I know you guys are behind, so real quick, in the border skirmish update, D.C. did kind of beat up on Cleveland. 
[00:27:30]  D.C. is doing really well right now.  Well, D.C. won.  No, the contest is still on.  It's still on.  I'm just naming her the winner.  Yeah, we're just naming her the early.  We're projecting that she's going to win.  Norton's showing me the lump in his pants.  Right.  Oh, God.  Now I can't hold down my clam chowder.  But the ladies could qualify all this week.  I think this is the last week to qualify for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  I'm no longer a Fox employee, gentlemen. 
[00:28:00]  Why?  I'm done.  I'm going over to ESPN.  Oh, yeah.  More sports, right?  That's it.  I'm done.  All right.  Well, I still went to the Fox party last night and trolled around for some A-sh.  Cool.  I'll see you guys later.  Hey, get us on ESPN.  Yeah.  You guys, at least on my show, whenever you want, and that's on tape, you can replay it to  me and hit me over the head with it.  Nice.  Cool.  I love you guys.  All right, Jay.  Later, Jay.  It's Jay Moore.  There he goes.  We've got to take a break.  The phones are lit.  If you're on hold, stay there.  We'll try to get to most of you, all right?  And then we've got these four clips of people eating puke. 
[00:28:30]  We've got old Dirty on hold.  We haven't heard from him in a month.  He's saying, my one-month Rick hiatus is over.  I'm calling back.  I don't know what that means, but whatever.  All right, we'll find out.  We have an instant feedback here from August Bush, head of Anheuser-Busch.  He says, hey, Moore, now it's mine.  Bum.  So remember, guns don't kill people.  Well, dangerous minorities do.  The Opiate Anthony Show. 
[00:29:00]  It just doesn't get any worse than this.  The Hickshare zebra finishing after Zeppelin plays.  That's pretty much what you're going to be getting.  You're checking out the Opiate Anthony Show.  Busy day for a Monday especially.  Yeah.  Let's go right back to the phones for a couple.  Max from Boston, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  I am freaking still hungover or still drunk or something, man.  We had a huge party, and after we won, I don't really remember this, 
[00:29:30]  but my friends all told me I decided to get naked and run up and down my street a couple times.  So it's like 20 degrees.  I'm just, you know, slapping in the breeze, run up and down.  People are coming out, screaming at me.  All of a sudden, a cop pulls up.  He's like, dude, you're naked.  Go inside.  So I was like, all right.  So I went back inside, and then me being the smart guy I am, I threw up, and I said, hey,  I'm going to go run naked through the streets again.  Went out, ran out.  Nine o'clock, showed up at my place, got arrested.  I was hoping I'm the first person to be arrested after the Super Bowl.  I doubt it.  I spent the night in jail in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, and that's it, man. 
[00:30:00]  When did the Pats officially win the Super Bowl?  I couldn't even tell you.  At that exact moment, someone got arrested, yeah.  I hope so.  I hope so.  I mean, my friends came down to Boyle's, and they said there were people that were everywhere  throwing stuff.  You got arrested naked?  Yeah.  Well, I had a pair of shorts on, and then they let my roommates give me a T-shirt.  That's cool, man.  All right, Max.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  I didn't mean to hang up on you earlier.  Hey, Tony, what's going on? 
[00:30:30]  Tony!  What's up?  All I got to say, first of all, is the Patriots did it.  They squashed everybody who said they couldn't.  They killed everybody.  Other critics can shut up.  But second of all...  I was with you.  I was with you, my friend.  You guys are two of the sickest mother-effers I have ever listened to in my whole entire life.  That Friday show was absolutely sick.  It was great.  I was in my car, and I pulled up in front of my house.  I sat in my car.  I didn't want to miss a thing.  I pulled you to my house, put on the radio.  The people are cleaning my house. 
[00:31:00]  I'm laughing.  They're laughing.  We're having a great old time.  Listen, you guys are just sick.  Yeah, we're going to play our clips in a couple seconds here, so stick around, all right?  Oh, incredible.  You guys are great.  Norton, you're awesome.  See you guys later.  All right, Tony.  And we're trying to hunt down Scott Farrell, but he may have OD'd or something, because  we can't find him.  We can't wake him.  We want Boston to get their last shot at Scott Farrell.  Hey, Boston, I don't know how this works.  Since the Pats are champs now, and they did very well, and they won a championship, are 
[00:31:30]  we now supposed to chant, Pat suck, Pat suck, down here in New York?  I don't know how that works.  Since the Yankees being champions, that seems to be all they're very concerned about.  You're chanting, Yankees suck.  I hear there were just, like, nonstop Yankees suck chants.  Huge.  Up in Boston at all the bars last night.  Well, they do suck.  Yeah, sure they do.  Just like the Pats.  Psycho, go.  Psycho Tim, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I didn't hear many psycho, I didn't hear many Yankees suck cheers. 
[00:32:00]  No?  You know, that's a big thing that New York wants everybody to think that we care about  the Yankees that much.  Oh, every time, more than three people get together in Boston, that's all you hear.  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  They change it.  They change it.  They go with St. Louis sucks.  We're getting intelligent enough to add different things in there.  I mean, even the guys from Salty are smart enough now to realize that they can change it.  What would be your answer if I said the Pats suck?  Well, they don't suck.  Why?  Well, how do they suck?  Well, they suck. 
[00:32:30]  They suck.  Now, what's your answer to that?  How do they suck?  They just won the Super Bowl.  Well, it doesn't matter.  The Yankees win championships, and they suck.  Why does that bother you?  If my team wins the World Series or the Super Bowl and another city's saying my team sucks,  I'm like, yeah, whatever.  Why does that bother you?  Most Boston fans don't say the Yankees suck because we know they're a good team.  Besides, we hate them, and we want them all to die and get in the coffin and get hit by a  box or get a plane fall down or whatever.  All right.  The fact is that we don't say, if you're a real Boston fan, hey, ho, ho, hey, hey, ho. 
[00:33:00]  Look at you.  Growing the F-bomb.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, Tim, so tell us what happened on the streets of Boston last night.  Well, we left the party just like what Ben did because we wanted to watch the game.  We didn't want to get a big bar.  It was four of us, one TV.  So then afterwards, obviously, we went out.  Went down to Land's Out Street.  Like, everybody's staying in from Land's Out Street.  It's a big riot.  But we riot good in bars.  We don't go to, like, L.A. where they pull people out of trucks and hit them with baseball  bats and bricks.  Down on Land's Out Street, there's, like, gangbangers, girls from D.C. and D.U. 
[00:33:30]  There's a couple yuppies and they're all dancing, jumping in the middle of the street, having  a good time.  Everybody's hugging.  There was no fight.  I like a good sports team riot, though, yeah.  Knocked over.  Maybe an occasional car going to knock over.  But how many cars are you knocked over every Sunday night in Boston?  What cities really know how to tear up their city when they, uh...  Chicago.  Chicago's a big one.  Detroit.  Detroit leads the way.  L.A.  L.A.  Yeah, a little bit.  Parts of L.A.  Vancouver.  The police didn't know what to do, obviously, because it's just, like, we have never won 
[00:34:00]  a championship, so it's kind of new for us.  How's Philly?  It's new for us to...  Is Philly like to tear up their other city?  Not like Detroit or Chicago.  Philly doesn't win anything.  Yeah, oh, is that it?  Thanks, Rick.  But, I mean, this is also new for us to riot, too.  I mean, we're making friends with all our cities today.  All right, Psycho Tim.  All right, guys.  We got to go.  We got another story coming in.  One of the winners of the Super Bowl tickets when we were up in Boston was Jesse, and Jesse's  friends on the line, John.  John, what's up? 
[00:34:30]  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Yeah, I just called to tell you that on the way down there, they got pulled over in Virginia,  and they had a 530 rack in their car, and they have, on the way back to Boston, they  have to go to a hearing in Virginia.  Wait, they got pulled over for speeding?  They got pulled over for speeding, and they had 530 racks in the car.  A what?  530 racks.  530 racks.  Budweiser.  30 beers.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but you're allowed to carry beer in your car as long as they're not open. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, they were open.  Well, did he get arrested?  Yeah, they got arrested, but he let them go to the Super Bowl on the way back.  They have to stop back in Virginia, I guess.  Yeah, sure, he's going to do that.  Yeah, I don't know if he would let them.  No, he has to.  He's going to.  Oh, really?  All right.  You all come back here, boy.  When you're done with your football game.  Good for the cop, though, letting him go to the Super Bowl.  Isn't that crazy?  Get Jesse on the phone.  I'll try.  All right, tell them to call the radio show tonight.  I will.  All right, bro.  All right.  Bye. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Why don't we play some of these puke clips?  Ugh.  Ugh.  All I was hearing is how disgusting the show was.  Friday?  That's what I heard from everybody at the party and everything.  Just how completely disgusting the show was from Boston.  Awful.  I can't believe how hot 37 is.  Holy S.  I want her to sit on my...  Well, yeah.  Thanks to Stephanie from D.C.  I now need a pressure washer to clean the banana juice off my keyboard. 
[00:36:00]  A lot of people not agreeing with us.  That's what we're doing in the contest.  Here's Will Hung from New Orleans.  Nice to hear what that faggot has to say.  You're in a bad mood today, brother.  Well, I'm saying, if you don't think Stephanie's hot, it says, nice entry from Sacramento.  Holy S.  How much did she charge them for posing?  Yeah, a new one from Sacramento just was put up on opianathony.com.  We just added about another eight or nine girls up on opianathony.com.  Literally like 20 minutes ago. 
[00:36:30]  So check out the latest entries.  All the girls that we photographed from Boston are now up and running.  Which one were you just talking about?  Sacramento.  One of the last ones.  All right.  Take a quick look.  What's this cowboy motif I'm looking at?  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Ryan from New Hampshire.  Last night at the riots in Boston, in true New England form, a drunk kid was walking around with a sign that said,  Warner is a fag, with hundreds cheering him on.  And Junius from Washington checking in again. 
[00:37:00]  He says, fake bit, guys.  Nobody ate someone else's vomit.  CBS would not allow you all to do that.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  Thank God we never ran it past them.  That was kind of a spur of the moment thing.  And after we got more tickets, and we had some puke available, so we figured we'd just let the guys eat the vomit.  See who could hold it down.  Ed, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  Yo.  I don't agree with you guys on the 37th.  No? 
[00:37:30]  No, I think, I mean, she's hot, but I think 32, Jessica from Cleveland, is a lot hotter.  Well, it'll be up to you guys eventually.  This is the last week to qualify, and then the voting starts next Monday, so.  All right, Norton rules.  You guys suck.  All right, bro.  She is hot.  Oh.  32.  Yeah, but that's hotter than Stephanie.  No offense to number 32, but that's not as hot as Stephanie from Washington.  I tell you, people's tastes are amazing.  It's very strange.  Where's Maureen in Boston?  Are her picks up, that hot one?  She had to withdraw from the contest because her ID was wrong. 
[00:38:00]  And she was probably the hottest girl we saw in Boston trial.  Oh, boy.  So hopefully they can work out what the problem is and get her pictures up.  Tommy, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You've got to do me a favor, man.  You've got to stop taking these Boston calls.  Why?  These people have their own languages.  They're wicked cool.  They need to come with subtitles.  How's the Red Sox doing?  They can do all they want with the Patriots.  Let's not forget the Red Sox.  Ninety-something years.  Suck.  All right, Tommy.  Later, man.  Bye.  Subtitles. 
[00:38:30]  Okay, here's the clips of the puke.  You want to set this up, man?  No.  Is this the one where the guys had to eat the puke?  Yeah, this is the first one we're going to play.  They're all short.  It's Frank.  Yeah, Frank was the first guy.  We have three guys.  Frank was a hardcore Pats fan, even more than the other guys, just because he had all the  garb on, man.  Yeah.  He had the sweatshirt, the pants, the hat, the t-shirt underneath, the Pats watch, I think.  He wanted to go so bad that he came in with two other gentlemen.  They knelt down in front of an open bag of vomit. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  This was for extra Super Bowl tickets.  We ended up giving away, I think, four pairs.  Yeah.  When it was all said and done.  And they each had a spoon, and their job was to spoon in a nice, chunky spoonful of clam  chowder vomit that came out of Kyle, one of the contestants in the chowder eating contest.  These clips will be up on foundrymusic.com in another day or two, by the way.  So Frank was up first.  The object was to eat a spoonful of puke, hold it in a minute, then the next guy's going 
[00:39:30]  to eat a spoonful.  He's got to hold it in.  The next guy, if they all do it, they do it again.  And they keep dining on the luscious puke until one of them pukes.  And he's out.  Then the two go, same thing, spoon for spoon, until someone pukes.  And the last person, or the person that doesn't puke, gets the tickets.  Right.  So Frank was up first.  He took a big, keeping, helping a vomit.  This was Kyle's puke.  Yeah.  The first guy that's still warm, by the way.  During the chowder bowl.  And I mention that because Kyle is checking in.  Hey. 
[00:40:00]  Kyle.  What's going on?  Oh, man.  You have a crappy phone, bro.  Puke on his phone.  I did.  Hey.  All right.  Kyle calls back.  This is the puke these guys were eating from Kyle.  Yeah.  So here's Frank's attempt at keeping the puke down.  All right.  Here we are.  The contest is on.  I can't watch this.  Super Bowl tickets.  Oh, my God.  I can't watch this.  He's got a big heaping, helping.  All right.  Here goes.  Super Bowl tickets.  Go ahead, Frank.  All right.  Literally.  And we do this until someone backs out.  Now, this is what we do.  You will each alternate with spoonfuls until one of you either puke or back out. 
[00:40:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  You've got to get this straight.  You don't just eat a spoonful and go to the spoonful.  You eat a spoonful what?  I mean.  You will eat one.  Then he will eat one.  Then he will eat one.  You will keep going round and round eating spoonful after spoonful until one of you puke or say no.  Then you're out.  And then you will continue the two years.  Oh, my God.  So it could be a lot of spoonfuls of puke before you win.  And then last guy standing has got a pair.  Go Pats.  Go Pats, Frank.  Go Pats.  And here he goes. 
[00:41:00]  There we go.  Here goes Frank.  There you go, Frank.  It's all right, Frank.  Do it down.  Swallow it.  Swallow it, Frank.  Frank stretching.  Frank.  Frank, you're all right, Frank. 
[00:41:30]  Frank, you're all right, Frank?  Frank, you're all right, man.  What's the matter?  He's doubled over.  Frank, what did it taste like?  What made you puke?  Frank, you'll feel better. 
[00:42:00]  Just puke, man.  Puke, Frank.  Get it out, Frank.  Get it out of you, man.  Frank, hang in the studio, though.  I mean, Frank, what happened, man?  If those two guys had the same thing happen, then we've got to figure something else out.  Hey, what are you doing?  All right.  Well, Frank, just stay there.  All right.  So there you have it for Friday's show.  Frank is seeing Kyle's puke.  Yeah, this is fake radio ass.  When he does it, wait until you see the video.  And then tells us this is fake.  So then the next guy goes, Tony. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Here's Tony's attempt at eating Kyle's puke.  All right, Tony.  It's to you, Tony.  Tony.  Tony.  Do it up.  Come on, Tony.  Go pass.  Tony walks up to the bucket, the tub, if you will.  Go pull the blood tub.  I'm sorry.  Hey, Rick, make sure it's official.  Make sure you get some good ones.  You got to pick up a big spoonful.  Just like.  Beep.  Come on.  This is the most awful contest.  I can't eat them. 
[00:43:00]  I've never left so hard in my life, though.  I can't watch him put the spoon in.  No, she can't.  Rick, make sure it's an...  That's a good, healthy spoonful, young man.  Get a deep in helping.  Enjoy it.  Come on.  All right, here we go.  Bottoms up.  He can't even raise it to his face.  Look at him.  Come on, man.  That's it.  Psyche yourself up.  Do it up, man.  Just do it.  Take it.  Come on.  Do it, Nicky.  Do it, Nicky.  Super Bowl.  Do it.  Pats.  Go Pats, man.  Do it.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl, man. 
[00:43:30]  He's shaking.  Just go, man.  Let it rip.  Let it rip.  It could have been down already.  There it is.  Six inches from his mouth, Anthony.  Here it goes.  He's slowly working.  He's doing breathing exercises.  We'll do it.  We'll do it.  Good, Tony.  Holy Jesus.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  He's ready to drink.  Here we go.  He's ready to eat another person's fomage.  Here he goes.  Here we go.  Come on.  Parmesan cheese.  Oh, come on.  Let's do it.  All right.  Just let it rip, man.  Here we go.  He's breathing it in.  I think he's trying to get his senses used to it. 
[00:44:00]  He's got a different strategy, and I kind of like his strategy.  He's kind of deadening his smell senses of it before he puts it in his mouth.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Come on.  Here we go.  This technique is called stalling, guys.  Here we go.  Yeah, I know.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Come on.  It's like Karina.  Come on.  Let it rip, man.  Do it.  Come on.  Let it rip.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's in.  It's in.  Tony's in.  And oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's all right.  Oh, he's.  Hold it.  He's heaving.  He's heaving.  He's heaving in there. 
[00:44:30]  Wait a minute.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  You all right, Tony?  Wow.  There were a couple of dry heaves.  He worked it out, and he's okay.  Tony.  Tony.  Can I ask you something?  I can't talk right now.  Can I ask you something?  Were you dry heaving when you.  Oh, no.  He's still dry heaving.  No, no.  Go over there.  Tony's heaving.  Tony, you're dry heaving, right?  He can't talk.  You can't talk.  He's dry heaving.  Oh, my God.  Tony, he's dry. 
[00:45:00]  You're dry heaving, man.  Right?  You okay?  Yeah.  What did it taste like when you ate it?  What did it taste like?  Did it taste like clam chowder or it tastes like vomit?  What was it?  Was it thick and clammy or was it vomity like when you're out all night and you puke and it  comes out your nose?  What did it taste like?  Yeah, Jason.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  Anthony, that one's on Anthony. 
[00:45:30]  I wanted to know what it tasted like.  You all right, Tony?  All right.  You okay?  Anthony, I just fell on the floor.  That dry heaving thing is hysterical.  All right.  You just seize up.  We're loving it.  All right.  We didn't say it during that clip, but obviously Tony lost it after drinking for about 20, 30 seconds.  He was seizing.  It was so funny.  He'd just stand there and he couldn't talk because he would have puked.  So he was just holding up his hands like, no, I'm okay.  And putting the face on like, no, no, I'm fine. 
[00:46:00]  I'm fine.  But then he'd go, and his whole like body would seize up.  He was fighting.  And then he gulped down and again, hold his hand up and go, no, I'm good.  I'm good.  And then he finally just boofed.  Let's go to Kyle.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, man.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys had that video of me puke.  You got to put that on the web of what?  Yeah.  It's up already.  Oh, that one's up.  Yeah.  What up?  That's the only puking clip that's up so far. 
[00:46:30]  And Steve's working on the rest of them for later on tonight or tomorrow.  Nice.  Hey, what do you think of these guys eating your puke?  I couldn't believe it.  That was all coming out of my nose and stuff.  That's wretched.  Oh, God.  Damn.  That's wretched.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, kid.  All right.  Kyle, thanks for helping us out on Friday.  Hey, without a doubt.  You guys rule.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  So then there were three contestants, and so now it's Jesse's turn.  If Jesse kept his puke down, he was going to the Super Bowl. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Kyle's puke as he scooped up a nice spoonful.  Yeah.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Well, if Jesse can keep it down, he's got a pair of tickets.  Yeah, Jesse, you keep this down.  You're going to the Super Bowl.  That's all you've got to do.  You've got to suck that up and keep it down, bro.  Don't say anything.  I won't say anything.  I do a little post-interview.  That's all.  He won't have to say anything, bro.  The smell's going to get you.  Just let it rip, man.  Dig in.  Get a big mouthful.  Enjoy the Super Bowl.  Dig in.  Mouthful. 
[00:47:30]  Enjoy the Super Bowl.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl, man.  Go Pats.  Go Pats.  Come on.  Go Pats.  Here he goes.  He's digging in a big spoonful.  Make sure it's an official spoonful.  He's holding his hand.  An official spoonful.  He's holding his hand over his mouth and nose.  Holding his hand.  You've got to get a huge spoonful, dude.  All right.  Here he goes.  You swallow it and keep it down.  Here he goes.  Hey!  Here he goes.  All right.  He's holding his hand over his hand. 
[00:48:00]  Go!  Sack yourself up.  Sack yourself up, bro.  It's like bad medicine.  He's slaught your hand over it.  Swallow it real quick.  And you're going to the Super Bowl, man.  Keep it down.  Don't think about it.  How long does he have to keep it down for?  Don't think about it.  Through the interview process?  No.  Through the post-interview?  All right.  Come on, Jess.  You can do this.  Come on, man.  Super Bowl, man.  Picture it.  You're sitting there.  You're sitting.  You're watching the Pats, man.  You're watching the Pats.  Here he goes.  All right.  He just swallowed it.  Oh, hold it down, bro. 
[00:48:30]  He's feeling fine.  You all right?  Hold on.  You okay?  Yeah, I'm good.  What did it taste like?  It tasted like clam chowder.  Did it?  Yeah.  Nothing different than just clam chowder.  Nothing?  Not much.  You don't feel nauseous, queasy, nothing?  I feel a little nauseous because I know that it's not just clam chowder.  That you just ate people's cube.  Yeah, it's a little stomach.  I got you.  Pretty much.  I'm going to have fun in New Orleans.  Dude, I think you are.  Not even a dry leaf?  Nothing.  Not even a dry heave, which is interesting.  I had one at first.  You did?  I didn't swallow it at first. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, you left it in your mouth to kind of wash itself.  Pukey chunkiness.  I think that's probably worse.  That's probably worse hanging on to it.  Anthony will give you one minute.  Okay, give him a minute.  One minute.  Did you taste the vial?  Yeah, was it?  No.  Now, you vomited in your day, right?  Yeah.  Out drinking and stuff.  Did it have that tangy, like, taste to it?  No, it didn't.  As it went down?  You ever puke into your mouth and then have to swallow it back?  Yeah, I haven't.  Was it like that?  No, it's not like that. 
[00:49:30]  It's not like that at all?  Was it warm?  No, it was pretty cool.  And chunky.  Was it chunky?  Did you feel the chunks going down there?  Any sign of a toenail?  A patty fungal toenail?  No, I was looking and I made sure there wasn't any toenail.  Oh, you're dead?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So it went down and now you're not feeling nauseous or queasy?  Nothing.  I can do what to be, though.  Well, you're going to have to wait, I think, for the minute.  Fifteen seconds.  Yeah, you know, you've got fifteen seconds and you're going to the Super Bowl, but I think,  you know something else?  I'm not even going to try.  The guy did it.  All right.  There you go.  And there you have it. 
[00:50:00]  Jesse won the competition.  I forgot about the toenails.  Won the contest, yeah.  We forgot about the Stalker Patty toenails that we put in for a little flavor.  Like, the vomit isn't bad enough.  Stalker Patty, remember when she had her toenails cut on this very show because she had these  big, nasty, gnarly, yellow, fungus-out toenails?  Because it hurt me to clip them so I couldn't cut them myself.  It's too much pain.  So we had a podiatrist come in, look at her disgusting hammer toes, try to figure that 
[00:50:30]  mess out, and he clipped her toenails.  Well, Rick thought it was wise to save the toenails for some future event.  Lo and behold, this was the event.  So not only did they have to dig in and eat the puke, but Rick had sprinkled in Patty's  disgusting, fungal toenails.  I get the cut of the...  It hurts too much.  All right, let's go to Chris.  Faking a radio bit.  Oh, I don't think you guys are faking.  I know you guys are for real.  That's indefinite short. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  You guys are awesome.  All right, man.  Let's go to Ephraim.  How many Teamsters did it take to tie that corset?  Hmm.  Oh, sorry.  I was just reading.  Big Mike, what's up?  Yo, what's the deal, man?  This Big Mike with the Slim Goodies, man.  Oh, yeah.  What up, good, Mike?  What's up?  Hey, man, y'all brothers are about to make me crash into something with that.  Throwing up and eating it all over again.  That's crazy, man.  That's crazy.  That's crazy. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Hey, yo, did y'all get some new Slim Goodies on their own website or what?  Yeah.  We just put up a bunch of new Slim Goodies like 20 minutes ago, half hour.  Oh, man.  Oh, the nice time.  Hey, I'm all for the underdogs, man.  See how they thought y'all wasn't going to make it in radio in New York.  Y'all was the underdogs.  I believe in y'all, man.  Syndication in the hood, man.  Thank you, my brother.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Big Mike.  A lot of people saying Contestant 69, Nicky from Sacramento. 
[00:52:00]  The last two pictures look like Scully.  From X-Files.  X-Files.  I can kind of say, look.  That's not bad.  Kind of.  Kind of a little bit.  They got a great digital camera in Sacramento.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Giving Rick a run for his money.  Very dramatic.  Unless that pose is...  You know, this chick...  Unless they're doing something with Photoshop or something.  You think they're cheating?  No.  This chick, Nicky, looks really good.  The shot where she's on the table.  You like that ass shot on her against the window? 
[00:52:30]  And then look at her on the table with her foot just bent up over her ass like that.  Yeah.  Sacramento only has two contestants, but they're going to be in the running as well.  Great job.  Let's all set and done.  Hey, Maria from San Francisco.  What's up?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Listen, I'm not from San Francisco.  I'm from Sonoma.  All right.  Uh-huh.  But I heard your Naughty Naughty contest is going on an extra week.  Yeah.  So where do I go in San Francisco?  Just go right to the radio station.  Hey, where's that?  The address is up on opianthony.com. 
[00:53:00]  Okay.  Well, hold on and someone will give you the address, all right?  Hey, the Philly girls?  You can go there right now and get your pictures taken.  Okay.  The Philly girls are hot.  They're tough to beat.  Oh, well, we got one from Washington we're really digging.  One from Sacramento we're really digging.  Oh, no.  I like the brown honeys.  I think New York, we're going to do okay in this contest.  Okay.  Well, here comes Sonoma.  All right.  Hold on a line and we'll give you the address.  Ladies in the New York area, you can stop by today with your Naughty Nineties.  Today is the last week to qualify for the Naughty Ninety contest. 
[00:53:30]  Yep.  Finally.  Okay.  There you go.  Old Dirty standing by.  Is Laura Korn here?  She's out there.  Laura's here.  And we got your hangover remedy.  Oh, my God.  It's a little too much energy for me today with Laura.  Hi, Laura.  But, uh...  We'll talk to you in a minute, Laura.  Keep her out there.  Look at how hot you look.  Yeah, she is.  Wow.  Wow.  She looks like she's glowing, like she's just got a fresh tooling.  She did.  Did you?  Oh, God.  Yeah, she loves to have to.  The worst laugh in radio is next. 
[00:54:00]  You got a war face?  What the hell?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh!  Oh, you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  The Opian Anthony Show.  Here, check it out The Opian Anthony Show.  Laura Korn outside the studio.  Oh, yeah.  The most annoying laugh in radio.  Awful.  You thought annoying laugh Anthony had a bad laugh? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  This laugh will drive you nuts.  And I know there's a lot of hungover people today.  Ah, gliddy, mate.  This will not help your hangover.  I'm in such a bad way.  I think her laugh is worse than the puking clip you just played.  Ah, it could be.  Oh, ow.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What are you doing, Nord?  You trying to hook up?  Hold on.  We'll get to Laura in a minute, Rick.  Scott Pharrell wants to check in.  We found him. 
[00:55:00]  He did not OD.  Good news.  Scott Pharrell did not OD.  Dude, I was just watching Britney throw some body around with fat Oprah.  God almighty, I never knew Britney Spears' body was evolving as such.  I saw her on the side of a building in Vegas when I was out there for the Lennox Lewis fight a few months back.  And I was like, Christ, she's good to go.  And then today I said, I'm confirming, she's good to go.  Yeah, I saw her on SNL this weekend.  She's getting a little junk in the trunk. 
[00:55:30]  She's getting a little action, but you know what?  She's getting horny and slutty at this age, it would appear.  She's starting to get crazy.  She's cutting movies.  Her videos now have like ten dudes at a time making out with her.  She's got like some femme from some sissy band she's dating.  I don't like his haircut.  She had a little jiggle in the ass and the thighs, though.  Yeah, I just thought that.  I was a little concerned.  She must be hanging around with Oprah too much.  Eating.  Oprah just loves to gorge.  Have you ever seen her?  That's fat ass. 
[00:56:00]  Even when she has book parties, she brings the food.  God damn, she settles up to a turkey.  Forget about it.  Tracy Morgan was doing a bit with her on SNL over the weekend.  And at one point, he looks at her and he goes, well, maybe you take those pants off and let me look at that ass.  But he said, he goes, why don't you take those pants off and let me look at that fat ass.  And she turned around and gave him a look real quick like he wasn't supposed to say fat and he didn't say it in rehearsal that way.  But knowing like Tracy Morgan, he probably just threw that in. 
[00:56:30]  I think that was how I got fired from MTV.  Hey, Pharrell, I'm happy to hear that you're alive and well after your Super Bowl party.  Dude, I drank so much booze.  I had like, I said today that there was like, have you ever seen those open earth restaurant fires they got like in a brick oven?  Yeah.  I had like a Coke oven going in my stomach with fire this morning when I got up at 4.30 because there was still a flame flickering like Castaway with Tom Cruise or whatever his name was, Hanks with the fire on the beach. 
[00:57:00]  I had a little fire in my gut and it was the Jameson 12-year-old mixed with a regular bottle of Jameson.  I had the 1780 going.  At the beginning of the day when I got to the gig, I sat on and there were all these kids there and I had my grandpa glass going.  By the end of the night, I was bowling using water glass filled with scotch.  Woo-hoo-hoo!  Woo-hoo-hoo!  Oh, we were ugly.  I had chicks.  I was hitting on my buddy's wives.  I mean, they were like, I saw this chick up there.  I said, damn, you look good after three kids. 
[00:57:30]  I'd do you.  Yeah, I had husbands in my face.  I had everything going.  I heard you didn't even watch the game at your own Super Bowl party.  Yeah, I didn't.  I had a hot date with just, she looked a, she was good to go, man.  She had some kind of funky hairdo and I was like, what do you got?  I got something for you.  Yeah.  She was drinking colorful drinks, too.  At the end of the night, I got a huge bill.  They tried to slap me with five different huge bills.  I accepted one of them.  I was like, this one looks good.  For about two Cs of just beverage intake valve.  I didn't get all caught up in the food. 
[00:58:00]  We were out in the parking lot.  There seemed to be some kind of fire in my limo.  I don't know what it was.  There was just smoke billowing out of the roof.  Yeah, I wonder.  Dude, we had a good time.  In fact, we won some money and everybody's got to remember, I'm an AFC guy.  Open up the phone lines for all those fems in Boston.  You want to hear it from me?  I rooted for them.  I had a bash and everybody was rooting for them.  Here's Joe.  Joe from Boston.  What's up?  You want, you guys.  Hey, Joe, you're on with Scott Pharrell.  Hey, Pharrell, where'd you get that voice? 
[00:58:30]  Taking too many loads in the back of your throat?  It only took 30 years for you Cs to finally win.  Now you'll be able to report at a stadium.  Joe, we stopped all over him.  Thank God you got a good coach.  What?  You got a good coach.  They played a great game.  I don't know what they want me to say.  What do you want me to say to them?  They won their goddamn Super Bowl.  Why did you admit that you were wrong?  No, Joe, he said on Friday he was going with the pass.  I took the pass, I had him twice on the money line for a dime.  That paid for the drinking bill.  I was rooting for him.  I've always been a guy to believe that if you do my team rectally, I got to at least clean up the animal bag. 
[00:59:00]  I was rooting for the Patriots.  I don't like the NFC.  I got sick of Jesus running the other team.  I'm a little bored with all that Chunky Soup Jesus crap with my boy, the quarterback.  My mom just had Jesus to marry kids.  I don't like the Rams.  They were going to blow everybody out.  That was as bad as the Steelers saying they were going to do them.  Nobody could do them.  They got the title.  Go to your parade, you femme. 
[00:59:30]  I think what are they going to have, a Bucky Dent float?  I mean, what are they going to have in their big party?  I mean, just happy Drew Bledsoe riding the horses.  A Bucky Dent float.  They'll be out of there.  They've got a big long parade.  They're so jealous in New York.  They're still mad.  They're still trying to blame me for their stupid Super Bowl.  Thank God it's over.  That only took 15 hours to play the goddamn game.  My God, I could have had two keg parties, had a live band Metallica came in.  I could have played in a poker tournament, a World Series of Three Hand. 
[01:00:00]  You check out the U2 at halftime?  No, I've seen them a few times.  What am I going to do?  Watch him sing and tell me about the economic summit and saving the world?  Everybody's saving the world.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I thought it was great the way it ended.  An ugly kicker boots a field goal.  His field goal was so beautiful, though I haven't seen a ball that looked that jacked.  He jacked it in it.  Right down the middle, man.  You know, the kid made clutch plays, too, Brady. 
[01:00:30]  He did the same thing against the Steelers.  Every time it was third and 11, remember the floating pass he threw to Troy Brown?  And then now the 21-yarder to the 36.  He made all the right plays, so much so that he made Madden look stupid.  He made everybody look stupid, Madden thought they should have went to OT, just go to one knee.  Yeah, go to one knee and sit around.  Well, that's what they used to do 20 years ago.  I think it was cool that the kid got it done.  And now he's probably got just chicks lined up in action.  He'll have trim for weeks.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:01:00]  He's good to go.  Poof!  Now his career's set, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  All right, Pharelli, we just want to check in with you, man.  You guys be cool.  Hey, have fun in New Orleans.  I bet there'll be a little action down there.  I mean, what do they do?  They just scrape up all of the urine and vomit from one batch, spray a little ice salt,  and then get it going again this week.  Get the party going, yeah.  Well, we're bringing all that back for a contest, so.  Dude, I'd love to go down there and yank some beads and some big knockers with you.  We're going to see everything.  The knockers, the clam.  Just get some tongue going for the Pharrell. 
[01:01:30]  You know, it's great to watch the big circles around the woman that gives BJs for beads.  You ever see that?  What's that big circle, Jerk?  What'd you say?  There's a huge, there's something that happens down there, like you'll get a big crowd of  people in a circle, and they'll be watching a woman giving hummers for beads.  That is just sweet.  I love that kind of action.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great party down there, man.  It's debauchery at its best.  I went down there for the last two times that they played, the Patriots, and lost. 
[01:02:00]  And it's strange, that building, for some reason, everybody lost a ton of money because  everybody bet the over, and I think that the under was a great bet if you had that.  But most people didn't combine them.  They'd say, you'd hear a bunch of people, and they'd say, well, I had the Patriots.  I won a bunch of money.  I don't believe anybody.  I think the bookies got pounded with the Patriots.  And then I think they got most of it back with the over.  I think everybody thought there'd be a ton of scoring.  We had a bookie from Boston checking in saying he lost his shirt, man.  Yeah, everybody lost a lot of money if you were on that side of it. 
[01:02:30]  I think people, everybody and their brother bet the Rams.  I have some funny stuff I'm going to play tomorrow of people that were calling me during  the game when it was 73 Patriots after Ty Law had the pick and went down the sideline  looking all cool, and he got into the end zone.  I had buddies calling my phone saying, it doesn't matter.  They're still going to score 30.  They'll never be in it.  They'll never be in it.  I'm going to expose all of the week tomorrow with the action that was going on.  And when you guys had that party, I can't believe you didn't take me to Boston.  I thought I was going to go up there and get in a couple fistfights.  Hey, I'm hearing you had a lot of weird side bets, too, for the game, huh? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I bet on everything.  I had every prop bet there was.  I bet on, I mean, everything.  We bet on what song you two would play.  We bet on, you know, total yards by Falk in the first half.  We bet on Kobe Bryant's points, Shaq O'Neal's free throw percentage.  We bet on, I mean, booze, shots.  We bet on everything.  We used to sit in Vegas and bet on if a husband and wife went into the header at the same time,  we'd bet on who comes out first to the water fountain. 
[01:03:30]  We had everything going on it.  I'm glad I wasn't there, though.  Wouldn't that have been fun?  And last year I went and I was getting my picture taken by the feds when I was walking in the parking lot.  They were, you know, behind everybody's back filming people walking around.  This year you showed up, what, three days before kickoff just to get in line to get into the building?  Yeah.  It's like five hours to get in.  Go to Mardi Gras and just pound booze and stand up hurls and hit on chicks that look like Britney.  There you go.  All right, Pharrell, go get some sleep, man.  I need it. 
[01:04:00]  All right, peace.  Peace.  There you go.  Scott Pharrell, our buddy.  Did they really give hummers for beads?  Yeah, there's all kinds of stuff going on down there.  There was a picture that was floating around the Internet.  That's terrific.  Oh, yeah.  She had a sign and everything.  You just see, yeah, and she's just, oh, oh, oh.  Seeds for beads.  Yeah, seeds for beads.  O.D., what up?  Old Dirty, you there?  Old Dirty.  You'll be.  My phone call ran out.  Yeah, we made them wait too long.  All right.  We're going to get Lauren in a second, but there's a girl that drove all the way from Cleveland 
[01:04:30]  because she was not happy about how the pictures came out in Cleveland.  She road tripped to get her pictures done by the master wreck.  Wow.  Hello.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  I went outside during commercials, and I go, wait, I know you like she's a famous person.  She's a celebrity.  I remember her shots.  Because she was wearing that same outfit on the internet.  I figured you'd recognize her with the outfit, so I wore the same thing.  Let's see, stand back a little bit.  She's got the little Catholic schoolgirl skirt on, the half shirt.  Hair and ponytails. 
[01:05:00]  Angry.  Oh, Norton, stop it.  So, you weren't happy with the pictures they took in Cleveland?  No, I wasn't.  No.  So, you decided, what the hell, I'll drive down and see the guys?  Let the master wreck.  Just for a road trip, why not?  Never been to New York before, so I've been walking around since 7 this morning.  Wow.  It was fun.  How many hours did it take you?  Eight.  Eight.  Where are you staying?  Nowhere.  We're driving home tonight.  Okay.  Wow.  Wait, you checked out the sights?  When did you leave?  This morning?  Last night.  Last night?  Last night at 11, and we're driving back after.  And you're also saying that you want to show more in your pictures, right? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, wow.  There's no problem there.  Not over here.  Oh, Norton, could you stop manipulating yourself?  God damn.  Every time a female's within, like, 10 feet of them, he grabs his junk and starts pulling  like taffy.  All right, so Rick will take your pictures.  Okay.  I just wanted my picture today.  And we look forward to seeing the reshoots. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  What are you going to show in these pictures?  Um, I don't know.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens.  See what happens with the mood and all that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Rick's going to get you in some weird positions, I'll tell you.  Rick.  He's the master.  That's fine, because they didn't do anything.  Really?  I had a few little, but they didn't let me show you.  That's great.  You should get extra points just for the effort.  And you have nice eyes, because your picture is on the internet.  You can't tell, because all the girls from Cleveland have the double eyes.  Take the glasses off for a minute. 
[01:06:30]  Wow, do you wear contacts?  Yeah, I can't see you at all when I take my glasses off.  You should wear the contacts.  You have nice eyes.  I do, actually.  Just nice eyes, yeah.  What are you going to...  I'm not saying you don't.  You're a very pretty woman, but I just...  Who would notice the eyes in that outfit?  No.  I look at eyes.  I never look at eyes.  Never.  You never look at a girl's eyes?  Brown ones.  I cover them, because I'm ashamed.  There's usually duct tape over them.  Eyes are where it's happening, my friend.  It's not even...  No.  Absolutely not.  You don't look at a girl's eyes. 
[01:07:00]  Never.  Never.  You are a whack job.  Unless I think she's looking at my mule, then I'll, like, follow the line down.  I have no desire to look at a girl's eyes.  Yeah, just to see.  Like, you like that?  Oh, Steve, what's up?  Yeah, I'm trying to hear about Norton Poon's junk all the time.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  It's disgusting.  He does it every day.  God, it's so gay.  It's not gay, sir.  I don't do it when it's just me and Ant in the room.  You do it in front of guys, you're gay.  No, sir.  I don't do it in front of guys. 
[01:07:30]  I just happen to leave...  You ever just reach down and squeeze, because there's a pretty girl around, and your buddy  catches you?  Just go up in a coffin and die.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Just reach him down and give him a little squeeze.  Right.  All right, so go get your pictures taken, and we'll talk to you after that, okay?  Sure.  She road-tripped from Cleveland just to get her pictures done for the Naughty Nighting  contest.  In a little Catholic school uniform.  Rick's feeling all happy about himself.  She came all the way from Cleveland to get you.  To let the master take her pictures.  Rick.  Rick's a pussy.  Old Dirty.  What the deal?  Happy New Year, Stan Dugay! 
[01:08:00]  Oh, D, where you been?  I just rose out of the sarcophagus and found out it was February, my brother.  What happened to you?  Nothing, man.  I was chilling, trying to cash in these chips, man.  Plus, Rick told me to come back in a month.  In a month.  He told you not to call our show for a while?  Yeah.  He told me to call our show.  They don't hear things that are told to them.  What happened?  I never said that.  Why would I say that?  I don't know, B.  You know who said it.  Nah, you call whatever you want.  That's obvious.  You know what I mean? 
[01:08:30]  You watch the Super Bowl.  Yo, son.  Yeah.  Come on, man.  How scripted was it, dude?  You think it was?  I don't know, man.  Are you talking another conspiracy?  Yo, yo, come on, man.  The Patriots, you know, they got the red, white, and blue on.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  There's a whole patriotic fervor sweeping across the country.  You know what I mean, dog?  Big word for you.  So you think it was a plot?  I don't know, dude.  But, yo, the Rams, number one team, number one offense, number one defense, they didn't 
[01:09:00]  show up yesterday.  You know what I mean?  Because it was a conspiracy.  And then on second and long, third and long, you know, the Patriots got their offense down  packed.  Just threw in all defensive backs to get anything from the first down marker, you know, to the  line of scrimmage.  So they had that on the lock.  So they couldn't go deep.  You know what I mean, dog?  You just got to analyze these things, baby.  I just thought you knew about crime, old Dirty.  Listen to him, talking football.  Yo, man, you had me on the phone so long, we should start charging 30 cents a minute 
[01:09:30]  to the people at home, because I'll be in charge of that.  Yeah, how many phone cards did you go through?  How many of those 15-minute jobs did you go through?  Nah, none like you.  I've remade myself.  Ever since I saw the commercials where, like, there's certain activities that people  do that support terrorism, you know what I'm saying?  That's what got me thinking, you know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  Old Dirty, I got to ask you something.  What's the deal, eh?  How are you guys dealing with the muni meters out on the street instead of the parking meters?  You go to the muni meter, you put in money and get a ticket, and then you put it on your 
[01:10:00]  dashboard, so there's no more parking meters for you to cut the heads off of and break open.  Well, you know, that sort of activity I never partook of, I might add.  Right, right, of course.  But the muni, well, you know, there's just one county, they've locked the gates around,  but there's a whole lot of other things to do, you know.  Oh, the ways to get around it.  Oh, it's a door.  Oh, right.  Or the other avenues.  Hey, Old Dirty, you check out the Super Bowl commercials?  Oh, I was feeling it. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, the commercials are funny.  I think people tune in more to see the commercials than the actual game.  The commercials were pretty lame this year.  There was a couple of good ones, though.  What's up with Britney, kid?  That was nice, right?  My goodness, the white man's prize.  Don't I want some of that?  She's getting a little junk in the trunk.  It's all right, Andy.  She's still...  It's all right.  Look, believe me, she is still beautiful.  Don't get me wrong.  All I'm saying is, she has got to watch it, because I can see there's a potential there. 
[01:11:00]  She might lose it?  She's getting a little jiggle in there, and her boobs were a little lower than they were last...  Hey, hey.  You know something?  I think he's crazy, dude.  I'm not bashing the chick.  I'm just saying, she's got to watch out.  You were smashed yesterday.  How would you know?  I would have been a little one.  Well, I will say about Britney, if she bends over her balloon knot, she'll probably lip-sync better than she did.  That's awful. 
[01:11:30]  That was awful.  Saturday Night Live, she's lip-syncing, and it was horrendous.  And speaking of lip-syncing, Mariah Carey...  Of course.  ...singing the National Anthem at the beginning of the game.  Totally lip-sync.  Yo, but, yo, definitely her PR people, you know what I'm saying?  Yo, because she was about to fall off the mat after she lost that record deal, you know what I mean?  Yeah, sure.  I thought it was over for baby girl.  It might still be, because, I mean, come on, man.  Singing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl don't guarantee you a platinum record the next time around, you know? 
[01:12:00]  Right.  But you know what, man?  It's like, come on, I'm tired of singers doing that.  Comics can't...  We can't dub in audiences that we had that we killed in front of.  Either do it right or get out of the business.  If you can't sing live, then you know what?  Don't accept the gig.  She should have been covering her mouth like Michael Jackson was down on Channel 2 that time.  Know what I mean?  I hear ya.  Yo, but yo, Anthony, man, get him back to the ass, man.  What's up?  Yo, what's wrong with Britney?  I mean, yo, come on, man.  There's a fascination now.  The people is focusing on full-figured, full-bodied women. 
[01:12:30]  You know what I mean, dog?  All I know is...  What happened?  All I know is when I saw her...  ...and you see you all day, all night.  Yo, you little French mother...  What's up?  Yo, you little punk ass.  You don't know me like that.  I fuck you like a croissant, you punk.  I fuck you, punk.  You ain't nothing but a jelly donut.  Yo, yo, what's up, man?  The next time I see you, I'm going to slap the French out of your mouth, you punk.  Yo, man.  Fuck it, man.  Did?  Yo, yo, how much you weigh, like a buck-thirty?  Yo, man.  I'm going to slap flames out of you when I see you, little bitch. 
[01:13:00]  Yo, kill yourself, man.  Why don't you bust a cap in your ass?  Yo, dude, you better get all your knives ready, son, because I'm going to five you up.  Bust a cap in your ass.  Yo, yo, I'm going to fold you, kid.  Yo, man.  I'm telling you, you're going to fall like a deck of cards when I'm...  Yo, I kill you, man.  I'm going to ring your neck, you little French bastard.  What do you think you don't know me like that?  You don't know me like that, little punk?  Yeah, yo, man.  You don't know me like that?  Yeah, why don't you walk around and get in your pants, son.  You don't know me like that, or you're going to get shook, right? 
[01:13:30]  Huh?  What?  You like that, huh?  Yo, how you going to put this cockroach on my airtime, man?  You want your ass cracker, huh?  I'm going to pay my ass.  He's taking up your airtime, old dirty.  Yeah, dude.  Frenchy's railing you.  Frenchy's railing you, old dirty.  Yeah, dude.  I'm going to get sad.  It's funny, you kid.  Hey, old dirty.  Frenchy's our new fine.  Remember the old days when you were our new fine?  Yeah, yo, old D, man.  I was thinking about that.  What's up, man?  You got the spotlight, you came in whenever you want, now we make you wait on the phone  for an hour, and Frenchy's taking your mic. 
[01:14:00]  Look at him sit where you used to show.  Well, you've got this good instigator, because I'm all about to murder him for my airtime,  kid.  And you're going to bust some caps tonight, huh?  No, we bust some caps.  Yo, faggot ass.  Look at Frenchy.  Yeah, who's the faggot now, huh?  What?  Little faggot.  He's our new fine, old dirty.  What is he new fine?  What is he cooking meals for you guys in the back office?  Look for your ass.  And his little hot plate?  Look for your ass.  He's the new kid in town.  Frenchy.  Yo, yo, yo, you see?  Yo, B, man.  That's my word. 
[01:14:30]  Yo, you're shysty, B.  You're shysty, man.  Frenchy's the new kid in town.  Yeah, man.  How you gonna replace me, man?  Come on, dog.  Yo, B.  What's the deal, man?  Yo, Frenchy, this isn't even about your little tweak yet.  I suck, kid.  I'm tired of you now.  Yeah.  I hope you kill yourself.  Look at him sit where he used to sit, old dirty.  What happened?  He's our new fine.  He's your new kid in town.  Look at him.  That's it.  Yeah, so get lost, all right, honey?  Oh, it's like that?  Yo, OB. 
[01:15:00]  Top of the pyramid.  Yeah, oh, he's top of the pyramid, man.  Yeah, there he is.  You lose, you lose, honey.  He doesn't have to wait on the phone.  He just turns his mic on whenever he wants to talk.  Oh, exactly.  Oh, exactly.  So, you, dude, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, and after the show,  we don't have to make sure our stuff wasn't taken, right?  That's another thing.  It was like that.  Yeah.  Also, so the little bitch amazed you with his little cookie skills and he's like,  I got to put him on top of the pyramid, right? 
[01:15:30]  He doesn't steal the computer after the show.  So, dude, I don't tell you what that's going on for me, you guys, and you know it.  You know it.  You suck.  I don't steal it from my girlfriend, you ain't even in the equation, boss.  Right now, what's going on is mathematics, algebra, kid.  This ain't one plus one, kid.  What is that gibberish anyway?  What are you talking about, man?  I'm a smash.  Speak English, goddammit.  You're a punk.  I'm a smash.  Speak English.  You don't know anything like that.  You're in America now, huh?  It's my word.  What are you talking about, or something? 
[01:16:00]  You don't know anything.  Huh?  Yo, yo.  Talk like a man.  Help.  A man speak it to you.  Talk like a man.  Old Dirty.  You little bitch.  Old Dirty, you go back in the...  Old Dirty, you're Mariah Carey.  Frenchie is Britney Spears.  Yo, you guys, yo, you guys didn't even buy me out of my contract.  You better get those breast implants and maybe have a little more life to you.  Old Dirty.  I'll show up a little bit, huh?  Yo, dude, yo, dude.  You can't do that to me, man.  You can't do that to me, man.  Oh, yeah.  Watch.  Yo, dude, man.  I was in the dog cages, my brother. 
[01:16:30]  Frenchie, would you like a cup of coffee or something?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  That would be actually a nice.  Bitch, nigga, you never get a good guy in the gutter, you boy.  You out, man.  You out.  That's it.  You lose.  I'm bringing him coffee and little pastries.  It's Frenchie's time.  Right.  I'm going to keep it wrong, yo.  Dude.  It's Frenchie's time.  It's Frenchie's time.  It's my time now.  Go get lost now.  Right here.  What's up?  Get lost, you bitch. 
[01:17:00]  Opie, Tom on line seven doesn't seem to appreciate Frenchie's time.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, boys?  I can't stand a useless walker or see them spick, but that little French bitch got to go.  You must be fat, you little faggot ass.  You may be, you must be a fat man, angry man.  What?  And as a child, as a child, your mama used to kill yourself.  Little bitch, you used to sleep with his daddy and sitting.

Give me a family and go quiet to your mama, you whore.  You suck at your mother, bitch.  Shut up, Beth, boy.  You made a lot of your own mother.  That's why you left friend.  You suck ass ass munch.  Thank you very much.

Huh?  Let's see what's up.  They come and go with the bathtub over there.  You can even have a stupid boat, you f-day.  All right, all dirty. 
[01:20:00]  Maybe I'll make a comeback someday.  Shut up, you criminal.  Yo, Greg, man.  We got to talk, Greg.  Hey, you just can't clean my car already, you f-quats.  Shut up, man.

Finish busting tables, you quats. 
[01:20:30]  I'm sure you're listening right now.  All right.  Go kill yourself.  All right, we got to get Laura Corey here.  Let's do that.  The girl from Cleveland is getting her shots done.  Have you done them yet?  I did one roll.  We're doing another roll.  One roll.  Look at Rick, like a real photographer now.  He's got to take a million pictures.  She's buying it.  Oh, okay.  Also, you know, they're not even listening.  I sent them an email, though.  There were wow stickers on some of the bombs that they dropped in Afghanistan.  What a cool bunch of pictures these guys sent us.  And they sent the pictures, and they're up on foundrymusic.com. 
[01:21:00]  Wow stickers.  Wow stickers.  And then Opie and Anthony say, suck it.  Yeah, something for you, Osama bin Laden, written right on one of those, yeah, big guided  munition.  Love it.  God, that's great.  Yeah, isn't that great?  You can check out the pictures for yourself on foundrymusic.com.  The link is on opianthony.com.  I sent them a nice email.  Yeah.  Look at that.  There's the picture right there.  Check that out.  There's a close-up that's even better. 
[01:21:30]  Also on foundrymusic.com is a bunch of pictures of Jim Norton entering the Naughty Nighty  Contest.  That'll make you just spit up your lunch.  Hilarious, hilarious pictures.  Great.  There it is.  Oh, it says, Osama, eat ass, love, Opie and Anthony with a wow sticker.  Wonder where that hit.  That's great.  Hopefully civilians.  Oh, you can only dream.  All right.  We've got to take a little break.  Piss that Frenchie is dissing the brothers. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  She deserves it anyway.  Oh, my goodness, Frenchie.  Oh, boy.  Austin checking in.  Hey there, sweetie.  How old are you?  Sixteen.  Eighteen.  You're first.  Mom!  I like where this is going.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including the home of contestant number 37, Washington, D.C., 866-277-4WOW. 
[01:22:30]  866-277-4WOW.  Naughty Nighty Contest continues.  You can qualify all this week, and then we'll finally start voting sometime next week.  Yes, Jim North.  Before you guys move on, I just want to send out a big F you to these scumbag protesters.  I wish the cops would just open fire and shoot them.  I am so tired of traffic.  I don't even know what the World Economic Forum is.  So, cops, I'm 100% behind you if you just start shooting and flame-throwing these little liberal jizz bags. 
[01:23:00]  How could they shoot anyone if they're hanging out here checking out our show?  Oh, no, of course not.  I saw some news footage over the weekend of these little troll people.  They don't even know what the hell they're protesting.  No.  They are walking around spewing.  I don't even know what half of them were talking about.  They're protesting Starbucks.  Yeah.  Like, what the, you know, big business in corporate America is going to. 
[01:23:30]  What's your problem with a corporation taking money?  Like, they think Starbucks should take their money and throw it to the poor people or something.  I have a problem with Starbucks.  I don't think they should be on every single block.  Yes, they should be.  Lewis Black does that bit where he saw the ultimate, a Starbucks, across the street from a Starbucks.  No, it was a Starbucks opening up in the bathroom of a Starbucks.  No, he, oh, whatever.  Good for Starbucks.  Let them do business. 
[01:24:00]  People are buying their product.  That's the only thing I support.  I'm tired of them.  I'm tired of traffic.  All right.  Cindy, real fast.  She's contestant number 40.  She has a problem now.  Cindy, what's up?  Well, I think Kristen's a traitor.  She drove all the way up to New York.  There's nothing wrong with Cleveland.  Well, she didn't like her photographs, and she thought she would be in better hands with Rick here in New York.  So she drove eight hours just to get a reshoot done.  This contest is getting serious. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  She wanted to see Rick's coiff.  Yeah, but look what Cleveland did with 61 and 62.  Cleveland's got it going on.  You guys got some fine representation, but you know what?  This girl that came from Cleveland, she's going to be officially in the New York section of the website now.  Yeah, you keep her.  She's a traitor.  We don't want her back in Cleveland.  She's a hot traitor, though.  She officially is from New York now, because you'll see the New York banner in the background and everything.  Good deal.  All right, Cindy.  Good deal.  Thanks. 
[01:25:00]  Bye.  And real fast is Zach.  And then we've got to get Laura Cornyn here.  Yeah, Zach, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Colin from Sacramento.  We're loving you out here, ONA.  Cool.  Thank you, man.  At any rate, two things real quick.  One, I wanted to know if you guys saw the WOW sighting on CNN last night.  A lot of people emailing saying that, well, it was a bar in Boston, right?  Yeah, it was during the report on the Patriots' beautiful win over the St. Louis Rams.  And it just pops up right in the middle of the screen.  It's on there for a good 30 seconds.  Yeah, we had a hardcore listener in Boston with one of the O.P. Anthony WOW stickers. 
[01:25:30]  I mean, it was just clear as day, I'm hearing.  Yeah, it was very nice.  And the other thing, in Sacramento, if this is possible, I've actually learned two things from the show today before I've heard it.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what those are?  What?  One, after seeing the Naughty Nighty contest, the brothers got to move to Washington, D.C.  Yeah.  Good God.  And two, protesters make good target practice for New York's finest.  Yes, they do.  There you go, Zach.  That was a good one.  Norton rules.  And you'll hear that in a couple hours, so good job. 
[01:26:00]  Protesters.  All right, look.  Open the door and...  The goddamn rose.  Oh, NYPD has nothing better to do but show a bunch of little spoiled mama's boys.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Open the door and let the laughing begin.  Here she comes.  Oh, this guy's too funny.  We got three police out here.  Well, well, allegedly.  Yeah.  What?  What's the story they told?  Well, they're street cops.  See, they're imaginary police.  They don't dress that way.  They're not really cops.  They're not really cops.  Yeah.  So we're standing there.  We're just kind of talking because, I mean, back there, I'm having, like, so much fun in 
[01:26:30]  your green room.  You've got a girl that Rick is photographing who I think is really hot.  From Cleveland?  In these really provocative poses.  Yes, provocative.  Provocative.  Rick's got a new one where he makes the girls crawl toward him.  Oh.  I was...  Wow.  I can't believe...  He starts from, like...  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Like, she starts, like, six feet away and crawls toward the camera.  And Rick's like...  Yeah.  Oh.  He goes, so this is the Britney Spears pose. 
[01:27:00]  And he poses her like Britney Spears.  Did you see Rick trying out the pose before he has the girl do it?  He goes, oh, my God.  Yeah, he does.  He does the poses.  He does.  Well, these girls aren't professionals.  I need to show them what to do.  It's like, crawl like I'm crawling.  And you can see when he gets really excited when he's got it right, you know?  Does he make them crawl with their asses up in the air and their front really low to  the ground like a cat in heat?  That's...  Yeah.  I call that the feline now.  You touch them on the back and they go...  Oh, well.  If he has to touch a little bit, he has to touch it.  Oh, let me... 
[01:27:30]  Oh, he's already touching.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, is it Dirty Sanchezes?  I got to tell you, though.  Speaking of kidding.  The crawl thing is great.  Yeah, that's a good shot, Rick.  It's great.  That's why they come miles and miles to be photographed by Rick.  Rick's just one name now.  It's just Rick.  He's a photographer.  You want to make an appointment with Rick?  Rick.  Yeah, he's the best.  So I'm standing here.  Lauren, you've got to calm down with the laughs today because there's a lot of hungover people.  I was out there.  Hey, you know what?  Guess what?  You're looking at one, too. 
[01:28:00]  So, Norton doesn't know who Lauren is.  You and I never met.  No, no, but you're really talented.  Thank you.  You're very funny.  No, are you?  I don't know what you do.  Well, I'm a sex person and...  We call her a sex piece.  I'm actually...  I write books.  And so I'm standing here talking to these two policemen and I said,  so how long have you been a fan of Opie and Anthony's?  And he turns to me and he said, well, ever since they had that sex doctor, Laura Korn, on...  Oh.  And I'm standing there and I said, I'm Laura Korn.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  Isn't it?  That's...  I know.  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  Small world.  She writes books and she's on the bestseller list and...  American sex diet.  And you guys helped put the Great American Sex Diet where the only thing you nibble on is your partner.  Oh.  On New York Times.  On the extended New York Times.  That's a little racy.  Oh, ho, ho.  And we've got a master chef here and...  Yes, what?  Don't be a tool.  How do you use it?  Tool bag.  Your book stinks, you whore.  You gotta watch out for Frenchie. 
[01:29:00]  There's one in one way of hobbing a knob.  But you said that you actually had...  So I'm on my Valentine's Day tour and it's good.  Is that it?  Yeah.  It's good to see you guys.  Very good.  Are we pushing the Great American Sex Diet book?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We are.  And I've got a lot of...  Sex recipes.  Ooh.  There you go.  Just add bleachy liquid.  And you know, I've got a lot of questions for you and your audience.  Yes, yes.  And about name that spice.  You want to start now? 
[01:29:30]  Name that spice?  Yeah.  Name that sex technique.  Oh.  You know, I've been coming and doing your show for what?  Like eight years?  Yes.  Yeah.  So I've been pretty much talking about a lot of sex tips and techniques.  You look extra hot today.  Do I?  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  I like the hungover, tired Laura look.  Oh.  I definitely...  I definitely think she got railed, though.  She kind of looks...  She's got that...  Freshly effed.  Well, I...  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Sure.  Kind of half-sitting, half-standing because the pooper was attacked. 
[01:30:00]  Ow.  Well...  Well...  Old Brazil's Patriots fan.  It's good!  By the way, I called the game, and although I had Patriots for seven, I did think they were  going to win.  Well, look at you.  There you go.  Yeah.  I just had a feeling.  I like the way they played against Pittsburgh.  Well, we don't want to hear you talk sports.  We want to hear you talk about, like, Hummers and A-Sex and everything else.  Give us something.  Well, you know, well, you were looking at the recipes. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I was.  And, um...  Pretty cool.  So, thank you.  The book...  We played against that script.  She put that in my kitchen.  You should put that in your kitchen.  That's true.  What's your best sex recipe?  Because he was looking...  Because the book is really cool.  So, for those people who have not seen it, it's interactive.  And it's got two menus.  Yes.  The book actually...  And they perf out of the book.  And they're great sex menus.  And there's one for him.  Menus.  Menus.  The best sex menus always have a real hypnol mixed in with whatever it is you're making. 
[01:31:00]  So, basically, the two menus, he has one, she has one, and the concept of the diet is  you just take turns surprising each other with these spices.  Give us some.  Give us some.  All right.  So, we'll play a round of Name That Spice.  Okay.  Now, which one?  Which one do you want to do?  The Hidden Treasure.  Oh, well, we talked about the hidden treasure before.  I'm so annoyed.  I'm not annoyed, actually.  I want to hear the spices.  Okay.  All right.  So...  Are you annoyed, Jim?  Not at all.  No, I want to hear the spices. 
[01:31:30]  I actually...  I like Laura, so I want to hear them.  Okay.  All right.  So, we're going to do some spices, all right?  I'm going to tell you the name of the spice.  You tell me what actually is going on.  What the sex technique is.  Okay.  All right.  This is actually one called Double Her Pleasure.  Oh.  All right?  Right.  You're in the spooning position.  Right.  All right.  Ugh, already.  You don't like the spooning position?  Spice it.  Why is that?  Do you really?  Yeah, there's A, because you're done already, and B, your hair is in your face, and it's awful.  Maybe you're not done yet. 
[01:32:00]  Do you learn from me?  You've never done.  I don't.  Stupid.  Okay.  Okay, so you're in the doggy position.  Do you like that one better?  A lot better.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  Get your hips pulled back, and...  All right.  Hell, you idiot.  You faggot.  You're gay.  You are.  You take...  No, I'm teasing you.  All right, Frenchy.  I'm going to turn your mic off, because we don't want to burn you out, man.  Right.  You're our new creation. 
[01:32:30]  We don't want to burn you out.  Can't burn you out.  Oversellous.  You know?  Overexposure.  I'm trying to retreat.  Overexposure.  That's what killed Old Dirty.  All right?  We want to have you around for a little while.  If they had that much moxie in WW2, maybe we wouldn't have lost so many of our boys.  All right, guys.  So we're in the spooning position, right?  Yeah, or doggy position.  All right?  Doggy.  No, say spooning so we can annoy Jim.  Okay.  All right.  Spooning.  So you are doing two things.  You are stimulating two erogenous zones at the same time. 
[01:33:00]  These are the two hottest erogenous zones that a woman has.  What are you doing?  Back of the knees, back of the neck.  Right?  You got one right.  Back of the neck is right.  I don't think back of the knees is.  No, but that's a good spot.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So you're kissing the back of the neck.  See, I'm staying away from the obvious.  You know, your tool put where, you know.  I would say the back of the neck.  The dirty penny.  I would have to go with the nips there.  The nips?  Yeah.  Outside of the nips.  What?  The reach around from the... 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Definitely.  The outside?  That's it?  Yeah, yeah.  With lots of oil.  That's obvious.  That's too obvious.  No, it's the outside.  No, but when was the last time you were there?  What?  Was it spooning?  I thought you were talking about the back end where you have contact.  I didn't know your hands could reach around.  Yeah.  Sure they could.  I didn't know that was part of the whole gimmick there.  You don't even have the goddamn common courtesy to give her a reach around.  Give her a reach around.  Can you tell me what your best sexual experiences are?  What's your best sexual experience? 
[01:34:00]  And I just hand it over at the end and they leave, sis.  Jeez.  Two on one?  Two on one.  How about you?  What?  I had a girl...  This is true.  So...  I had a real submissive one time.  Give me a Hummer.  Yeah.  A sloppy wet one, may I add?  And at the end, she said, thank you, Jim.  She thanked me for a while.  Wow.  Permitting her to service.  Wow.  How about that?  That was a good one.  Unfortunately, she didn't throw herself down the steps. 
[01:34:30]  That would have made it perfect.  Yeah.  That's true.  Okay, I've got my favorite new technique.  Yeah.  Okay?  It's called...  Guess what this is?  It's called the Kitty Popsicle.  Spelled now?  That's K-I-T-T-Y, the Kitty Cat Popsicle.  Somehow, it's not anymore.  Right.  Kitty.  And that was Anthony.  I didn't say anything.  Old Jim Norton avoided that one.  Suddenly, it wasn't that hot.  Now, you know that, Opie, I like to have a couple try this. 
[01:35:00]  And this is on her menu.  And it's...  Wait, we're going to do the Kitty Popsicle live on our show?  The Kitty Popsicle.  So we need a...  We've never done this.  And it's a...  So what?  We'll get a couple...  We've got the Iron Chef over here looking over at the Kitty Popsicle.  Oh, look.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  You've got to look it on her menu.  On her menu.  Okay.  I actually renamed it.  All right.  Take a look at it.  The Kitty Popsicle.  The Kitty Popsicle.  So why don't we get a couple...  So how would you make a Kitty Popsicle?  Take a mule and put kitty litter on it.  And then point a gun at her head and say, lick. 
[01:35:30]  I would think...  A Kitty Popsicle.  I think it would have to do...  Okay.  Let's be obvious here.  Is there something with ice or cold?  No.  No.  Because I was going to get...  And this has got to be one of the hottest, hottest things a woman can do for a man.  Oh, okay.  It's a woman doing it to a guy.  Did it involve her putting something on your junk and licking it off?  No.  Okay, good, good.  All right.  No.  You're a sexy lady.  Stop it.  Does it...  No.  It has to do with licking something like it would a Popsicle. 
[01:36:00]  Jesus Christ.  What?  I have no idea what the hell it means.  How about you take a Popsicle stick and as you're stimulating the man in the boat...  Yes.  You take the Popsicle stick and you cram it into the balloon nut.  Make a fudgicle.  Yeah.  And you pull it out and slap her face for not being clean.  Dirty whore.  No.  Oh, God.  Can I call you the next time I ride a boat? 
[01:36:30]  I don't know.  Does it have to do with the girl servicing the guy orally?  Kind of.  Yes.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Yes.  Like a teabag?  It does.  Kitty is important, though.  No.  No.  Kitty is important.  No.  It's not holding the junk like a Popsicle stick and working the yam bag like the treat.  No.  Is it licking it like a kitten?  Son of a...  That is part of it.  That is absolutely...  That's part of the Kitty Popsicle.  From the balloon knot to helmet. 
[01:37:00]  Is that what that is?  Like the whole area.  Uh-oh.  The whole area.  All the way up.  The whole undercarriage.  A little mushroom flavor.  Then, uh-oh.  Overbag.  Overbag.  Jim, I don't need to see your technique, man.  Jesus.  That's wrong.  I didn't like that visual.  Can we get a couple?  You need a couple?  Yeah.  Call in.  They're home right now and they want to fool around a little bit and try this Kitty thing.  Kitty what?  Popsicle?  The Kitty Popsicle.  It's on her menu on the Great American Sex Site.  Where the only thing you nibble on is your partner. 
[01:37:30]  Give us a call and what Laura's going to do is tell you what the Kitty Popsicle is all about.  You try it out and then you give us a call and tell us how it was, right?  Right.  Okay.  Nolan, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hi.  Hey.  What's up?  Hello.  Nolan, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Listen, I'm married three years.  I'm 26 years old and I wanted some tips on stamina.  I'm having a little stamina issue.  Stamina?  What happens?  How often do you have sex?  It's not really premature.  It's just I can't last more than a couple of minutes, five minutes at the most. 
[01:38:00]  Why?  What do you mean?  And how long have you been with this lady?  I'm married for three years.  And you can only last that?  Let me ask you, how often do you have sex?  Be honest.  Two or three times a week.  Okay.  The more you have sex, the longer you last.  So if you have sex four or five times a week, you're going to last longer.  Dude, what happens?  Do you lose the goo a little too?  You know what?  No, ladies.  She's got to do it.  Ladies, don't do that.  No, no, no.  No, no.  But you do it gently because that stops you from... 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God, Laura.  But it works.  Dude, why would you...  Hold on, hold on.  I know they're going to dump out like crazy.  Okay.  Because they're weird with the rules.  Just say yambag.  Yambag.  Yeah, yeah, just...  A little tug on the yambag?  Just a little bit.  You just pull them down a little bit and it stops you from having...  Oh, ladies.  Careful because John Boy Walton will dump out of that.  Just a little tug, right?  Just a little tug.  Sir, why would you want to last longer?  What's the problem?  You jump on, you finish, you go back to the television. 
[01:39:00]  What's wrong?  Well, I want to help her, you know.  Pace yourself.  Everyone for themselves, sir.  Are you doing the same kind of...  Are you doing the same positions?  Are you trying different sexual positions?  Yeah, with different times, you know.  Yeah.  Depending on the mood.  Uh-huh.  It depends, you know.  What?  Well, you know, when she's on top, she can control your orgasm a lot better.  Can't you last longer when she's on top?  Actually, usually the least enough to find them.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's because then you've got the full, nice view. 
[01:39:30]  She's rocking and rolling.  Yep.  Oh, God, a great...  Why don't you just numb it up, man?  Oh, man, this is a great tip.  I love this.  You are on top.  Ready?  Let's see if I can figure it out.  This is awesome.  Have you ever had this done to you?  You're thrusting, but you stop.  You're on top.  You're in the male superior, right?  Then you stop thrusting.  All right, right.  And then she lifts up her hips and goes crazy.  The pelvic rock on your...  Okay, all right.  You know what I mean? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't that...  Have you done that?  I have a much simpler technique.  That is really...  Is he...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, go ahead.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  Is the guy still on the phone?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm here.  Dude, what works...  This is true, actually.  If you're premature and you're getting close.  You turn on your computer, and as you're doing it, just as you feel yourself about to go,  you click on eatabullet.com, and that visual will stop you, believe me.  You are a whore, man.  That's his website, by the way.  That's his website.  Yeah.  Hey, no one wants to have sex, Laura, today, I guess. 
[01:40:30]  No one's going to have sex.  We need a couple.  No one...  We need a couple to try one of the techniques out of the Great American Sex Bet.  What do you think the sex should do?  I think you should have sex more often, and I think you should try new things.  I think you need to...  Okay, are there any other...  Are there any techniques...  Like, a friend of mine told me about the technique where you try and squeeze, you know,  the muscle, like, in between the...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's really complicated.  I mean, you know, that's...  You know, male multiple orgasms, where you actually squeeze...  You know, you try to... 
[01:41:00]  Oops.  That's not an annoying little tune on there.  Is that your phone?  That's it.  Your phone rings like that every time.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  That's a music line.  You should play that just so the orgasm happens.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Just play that song, sir.  That'll stop you from dumping.  By the way, I've got a really good one.  Here's another one.  You want this one?  You're in the doggy position.  Yes.  This is great.  All right?  Do you like the doggy position, sir, from the back angle? 
[01:41:30]  There you go.  And then you go back in, right?  Yeah.  And she'll love it.  There you go.  So you alternate between the two sensations.  Right.  You feel like you're going to lose it.  You stop and work the face.  Yeah, no, it's not all about you.  Because it only tastes a lot better after your junk has been leaking in there.  How awful is that idea?  No, no, I always take care of my woman, you know, but I want to be able to last longer after I take care of her, you know? 
[01:42:00]  Right.  That's really what I'm trying.  Like, you know, usually I take care of her first, but then it only lasts two, three minutes.  There was a product out there called Mandalay, where it just, like, numbs your junk.  Yeah.  I swear to God, it's a real product, Mandalay.  And there's also something called Handjob.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  A product called Handjob.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's, like, the most incredible lubricant that you can put on Mr. Friendly. 
[01:42:30]  How about that?  And there's also a thing called, stop banging like you're 15 and hold off a little.  Back in the day, you used to do a little.  We've got to go.  We've got to go.  So, people, you can call in and I can give you some sex tricks.  Oh, why not?  We're still looking for a couple.  We might have one.  Karen.  Karen.  We're looking for a couple to do the Kitty Popsicle thing.  Okay, what exactly is that?  I want to try it, but I came in in the middle.  Okay, so are you with your guy?  Well, not at this minute, but I do have somebody. 
[01:43:00]  Okay, can you do it in the next 20 minutes, 30 minutes?  No.  Oh, see, we need a guy and a girl.  We need a couple standing by right now.  We need a couple standing by to try this technique, and I will also give a technique to the guy to do.  How far are you from the studio?  Me?  How far am I?  All right.  Karen, we've got to let you go.  Yeah, Norton's going to be your partner.  We have to let her go.  We're looking for a couple to try this right now.  Kristen, what's up?  Hey, Kristen.  Kristen. 
[01:43:30]  Kristen.  Hello.  Says, I have to know what Kitty Popsicle thing is.  Hey, Kristen.  She's gone.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  Not there.  All right, let's go to Peter.  Peter, you're next with Laura Korn.  Hi, I've got a question for you.  Is there one ever change the subject, though?  Yeah, go ahead.  Sure.  I have a question.  It's about the women's female, the G-spot.  Yeah.  Is it true that any woman can have a reaction from that?  You know what I mean?  A G-spot orgasm?  Right, right.  Oh, very good, Opie.  Very good.  G-spot. 
[01:44:00]  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, absolutely.  I have a video called the Incredible G-spot Video, The Ultimate Sexual Experience.  Opie and Anthony, you've seen the video.  You know it.  Actually, we took a camera and we put it inside.  Oh, thank God.  Yes.  And we actually show you exactly where the G-spot is.  Ah, you make a little map.  Sure.  It's a show called The Y-Files.  So, what time is it?  So, you're in, you know?  Yeah.  And where is, what time is it? 
[01:44:30]  So, pretend that there's a little small clock inside.  Sure, sure.  So, what time, where is...  I'm a pilot, so I know that.  There's no problem.  Wait, let's...  But what time is it?  90% of women are sensitive.  Their G-spot is between this time.  Okay, okay.  This time of the clock.  What time?  5.30.  No.  No.  No wonder.  Quarter to 7?  Jeez.  What is it?  What time?  It's actually 12 o'clock. 
[01:45:00]  Well, it's straight up.  Yeah.  Curled finger.  You got it right, Anthony.  Tap, tap.  That's what I was thinking, actually.  I was thinking 12 o'clock was something itself.  I was confused.  Let me tell you something.  You smash stuff around enough and, you know, you join.  You do enough rubbing and moving and twisting and everything all around.  You're going to hit the right parts.  Anthony, I'm an aerobatic pilot.  I'm going to follow the pilot, you know?  Yeah.  So, 12 o'clock, it's going to be 6 o'clock in the role of the stick, you know? 
[01:45:30]  No.  Dude, the back is your 6.  You should know that.  I know that.  I got it.  I got bogeys on my 6.  I want to tell you, Laura.  So, the answer to your question is every woman has a G-spot and every woman can have a G-spot  orgasm.  I found a website.  I can't say the name of it, but it's themanontheboat.com.  Yeah.  And that's really good.  It tells you it's like a...  Peter just stumbled through that.  No, it's 12 o'clock, unless you're in Los Angeles.  Then it's 3 o'clock.  Right.  All right.  Eric, what's going on?  A little clever time zone.  Hey, Eric. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing, man.  My wife's getting all horny.  All right.  Where are you guys?  Hi, Eric.  In my car, man.  We're parked.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  So, do you want a technique?  Yeah, she wants to do it to me.  Eric.  But can you do it in the car?  Yeah, it's the moment.  You can do anything in the car.  Put her on the phone first, because I've got to make sure we're not wasting our time here.  Put her on the phone.  Hold on a second.  I can give him the...  Yes?  Hello?  Hi.  Oh, there she is.  Hi.  You're a guy.  No. 
[01:46:30]  Don't be a dick.  Anthony.  Awful impression, that one.  Anthony is the girl.  See, no, it's not.  No, it wasn't.  It absolutely wasn't.  Let's go to Penn.  Absolutely wasn't.  Ben, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Not much.  Just waiting to learn about this great position.  All right, so now where are you?  Do you have a girl with you?  My wife?  I have my wife with me, and we're in our bedroom.  Put her on the phone.  Sure, hold on.  All right.  Hello?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Where are you guys calling from?  Buffalo.  And you want to try the Kitty Popsicle? 
[01:47:00]  Sure.  All right.  What's going to happen?  Laura Korn's going to tell you.  I'm going to go into the other room.  Yeah.  I'm going to give you the technique, and you're going to try it and call us back.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you something.  What's your favorite thing that he does for you sexually?  What do you like more than anything?  Oral?  Foreplay?  Intercourse?  I don't know.  Do you like toys?  Do you have a toy?  Pardon?  Do you have a toy?  Do you like toys?  Vibrators?  Not really.  Not vibrators.  Do you like oral?  Do you like receiving oral?  Nothing.  A dopey question, Laura. 
[01:47:30]  Well, no.  You'd be surprised how many women don't.  Do you like toys?  Do you use toys?  Do you like toys?  I'm an auctioneer.  Oh, man.  I've got a great toy trick.  What?  It's an awesome one.  All right.  Well, all right.  So, I'll go in.  I'll give it a Kitty Popsicle.  Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Are you guys into this?  Your wife seems a little mellow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I use the back of my hand.  Let's her up a little bit.  Hey, there you go.  Oh, boy.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a line.  It's called the Norton.  I'm not in the mood. 
[01:48:00]  Yes, I am.  Well, you know what?  We'll see if this works.  She sounds like she needs something done to her.  Let's get a backup couple.  We've got Karen on the line.  Karen.  Hey, Karen.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Are you at home with your boyfriend?  Yes, I am.  And you guys want to try the Kitty Popsicle thing?  Yeah.  All right.  Laura?  Okay.  Where's your boyfriend right now?  I'm going to go into the other room.  I'm going to give you the technique.  He's just turning the radio on in the other room.  For those people just tuning in, this is from the Great American Sex Diet where the only  thing you nibble on is your partner.  And it's not a diet of food. 
[01:48:30]  It doesn't have any food.  It's sex.  So, I'm going to go in the other room and give you this technique.  Yep.  And you guys will try it and then you'll call us back when you're done, all right?  Okay.  All right.  Master Chef, which one?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I just had a curiosity.  Which?  Because he's like totally Master Chef over here.  Oh, yeah.  Well, don't worry about him.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  So, go talk to those couples and get them going.  All right.  We've got Ben on line 9 on the national line and we've got Karen on line 10 from New York.  They're both going to try it.  Oh, you like virtually.  And if all you nibble on is your partner, there is food, actually, a little bit.  There's fish, bleak, and mushrooms. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, you like orgasmic overdrive?  Hold on, Laura.  We'll talk about that next.  Okay.  We're real late right now.  Yeah.  So, go talk to the couples.  Karen on line 10 and Ben on line 9 and we'll be back with Laura Korn.  So, remember, guns don't kill people.  Dangerous minorities do.  The Opiate Anthony Show.  It just doesn't get any worse than this.  The Hickshark zebra finishing after Zeppelin played.  That's pretty much what you're going to be getting. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, it's the Opiate Anthony Show hanging with Laura Korn.  Boy.  Well, wait, dude.  Are you like, do you take care of her emotional needs?  That's when women start holding back the box when you start like not, seriously, when  they feel you don't care about them emotionally, they're like, they don't want to have sex because  they get eventful.  Know what a drunk Tim Sabian told me at dinner when we could go in Philly?  I'm a little frightened now that this subject is a brutal thing.  Yeah, we're hanging out with a bunch of couples and he goes, yeah, sex with me and my wife 
[01:50:00]  stopped as soon as they brought out the wedding cake.  Oh.  Yeah, we've been together like three years.  Do you guys argue a lot?  Three years.  Hey, Laura, we got a problem.  This guy, he's been dating his girl for three years.  They've been engaged for six months and the fiance doesn't want to have sex anymore.  Oh, my God.  That's a warning.  You know what?  There's 24 million women who have little or no desire for sex.  24 million women.  I think I did half of them.  No desire. 
[01:50:30]  Little or no desire for sex.  Well, it used to not be that way, though.  Well, of course not.  In the very beginning, you're like little bunny rabbits.  Yeah, even until like three months ago, it was like...  So what does she say?  What does she say?  What's the problem?  Maybe she's banging an old boyfriend or something.  You know what?  She's in a cycle, and the cycle is not having sex.  And that's what a lot of women do.  They get into a cycle.  Yeah, but the pressure's on because they're getting married soon.  Why would a guy ever marry a girl that decides six months ago, you know,  she won't have sex with you anymore? 
[01:51:00]  You know what?  Are you doing the same thing every time you get in the bed?  Are you surprising her?  Are you doing anything different?  We've done some different stuff here and there.  Here and there?  Why doesn't she surprise women?  Why doesn't it all have a dime responsibility?  Why doesn't it always all fold?  There's two menus here.  You take turns.  You know what?  Why don't I send you a copy of The Great American Sex Diet?  Oh, no.  You will definitely...  You can hit her over the head with it.  It's a big book.  Lumber and banger.  There you go.  Bash her brains in, sir. 
[01:51:30]  Good luck.  There's the annoying one.  I don't think a book's going to help this couple, though.  Oh, my God.  Look at the 38 couples that are in the book.  Did you see me on the other half last week?  No.  Did you see this new show?  Hold on.  I'm going to help Tom here.  Tom, when was the last time you had sex with this lady?  Two weeks ago.  See, there's no anticipation.  Two weeks ago?  Anthony.  Yeah, last week ago.  I thought you said you guys haven't had sex in months. 
[01:52:00]  Well, okay.  When we first got together, it was like three, four times a week.  Ever since we got engaged, it's been like once every couple weeks.  And then I had sex two weeks to go.  And then before that, it was about three, four weeks to go.  Uh-oh.  Well, dude, Laura raised a good point.  You said something about surprise.  I do a sub-screen and just yell, surprise!  That might do it.  Surprise.  You know, the other thing you can do is take your menu from the great American sex diet and surprise her. 
[01:52:30]  Hold on.  Dean.  Man, don't worry about it.  Dean.  Hey, can I?  Yeah.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Dean.  Yeah.  You got some advice for Tom?  Don't get married.  Right.  It's so much worse.  Yes.  I've been married five years.  I have sex once a year.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That's ridiculous.  What day?  Groundhog Day?  Before I got engaged, I had sex every day.  Oh, my God.  A strong sword shadow. 
[01:53:00]  I gotta go.  Did Poxatani Phil see his shadow?  Another six weeks of no sex.  I hate Poxatani Phil.  Poxatani Phil.  Here he comes.  Out of his hole.  And there they are.  And then they show one from Staten Island.  Show another one in Virginia.  They all got different answers.  He saw his shadow.  He didn't.  And shoot the thing.  And the one in San Francisco is crawling out of a balloon nut.  A gerbil.  So, Tom.  Yo.  You're looking to, you've got to do something to jumpstart you out of the cycle. 
[01:53:30]  She's in a cycle of no sex.  I know.  I created this book when I didn't have sex for two months.  I stopped having sex.  And I know what that's like.  Why is that?  Why is that, Laura?  Why?  Are you fasting?  It was like a fast of sex.  No, I just, I got, I swear to God, I didn't think I would ever have sex again.  Why is that?  Why am I a sex expert?  What happened?  I just got burned, I got burned out.  And I didn't understand.  I was in a cycle.  You got calloused, trick, hip. 
[01:54:00]  I was just in a cycle.  And that's what 24 million women are in.  And I swear to you, I had 38 couples, 38 women from across the country go on this diet.  They were in a cycle.  They had little or no interest in sex.  They have kids.  They have jobs.  And they're in the book.  Kids.  And they did this diet with these two menus, and every single one of them had the most  intense sex and the best sex of their life.  So it works.  Would you like a copy? 
[01:54:30]  Did he go away?  Ah, there he is.  Well, they picked him up for some reason.  Okay, all right.  Well, let's send him a copy of The Great American Sex Diet.  All right, let me go to Rick in Cleveland.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, good.  You're going to have to word this very carefully, my friend.  Okay.  Don't use that E-J word.  E-J word.  Sure.  Waterfall.  Gotcha.  Very good.  Go ahead.  Tell us the problem.  All right.  My girlfriend waterfalls whenever I go swimming with my canoe. 
[01:55:00]  Oh.  Oh, God.  Only like 3% of women are able to do this.  This is pretty good.  This is interesting.  Several other girlfriends of mine have done this.  I was curious.  Wow.  What am I doing that?  Hooked?  He's got a...  Do you have a hook?  He's got a hooker.  Or are you dating good actresses?  Big gush.  No, you can't...  You know what?  You can't...  Big gush.  You can't...  You can't...  You can't fake that.  You mean the gush?  Yes.  The gush of that.  You like that? 
[01:55:30]  Not on your chin.  So...  So, Rick, you have a curved one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, it's...  Do you do this with...  It's hitting the G spot, my friend.  Yeah, it is.  But a lot of women don't do that when they have a G spot orgasm.  Sometimes it's kind of dry.  Yeah.  But what are you doing?  Are you doing intercourse?  Are you diddling her?  What are you doing?  Both.  I can do it intercourse most of the time.  But you can do it...  Some of the time, I can get her to go intercourse through a diddling her. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  But it takes a lot of practice.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I did say that, so Michael Landon's going to dump that.  Don't use that C-L word.  Oh, okay.  Yes, yes.  A man in the boat is what we call it.  Well, you're a lucky guy.  Congratulations.  Yeah, there you go.  How many different ways do you know how to do that, by the way?  Four.  Whoa.  So you do it with your hands?  You do it with...  Right, with his junk. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  As they say, let's just call it junk.  Okay, with his junk.  Yeah.  You can do it with your...  Oh, I'm sorry, different positions.  Oh, different...  Okay, what's the most...  What's the most...  What are the positions?  Doggy style?  Man dominant with their legs.  You know who else has the talent that this guy has?  Yeah.  Mike Tyson.  But it's out of pure fear for their lives that the women just...  They just let go on themselves.  Some men, too, sometimes in prison. 
[01:57:00]  Look how talented of a sexual partner I am.  The men I'm with in the weight room, they all do that, too.  I leave the front of their pants all soggy.  And so, anyway, I was curious, what causes that?  I gush, too, out of my eyes when the mace hits me.  Anyway, what causes that?  It only happens every now and then.  What causes it, Laura?  Oh, God.  Well, you're doing it for a certain length of time, and you're probably doing the same motion. 
[01:57:30]  Might not get that through, either.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't describe, really, that detail, where things are going and what they're doing.  Okay, okay.  Kind of got to work around it.  Well, if you'd like to be able to do it every time, then I would recommend getting my G-Spot video.  By the way, it was voted by Men's Health Magazine as the best instructional video on the market.  Not to mention the only one. 
[01:58:00]  And listen, can I give my 1-800 number a day?  Yeah, go ahead, Laura.  Okay, here's my 1-800 number if you'd like to get a copy of The Great American Sex Diet,  where the only thing you know belong is your partner.  G-Spot videos, all kinds of stuff.  1-800, you remember the number, 547-  He doesn't like the subtitle of your book.  Oh, he doesn't, B-O-N-K.  I'll tell you why I did that.  547-BONK, B-O-N-K.  Check out my website.  I got a website, guys.  Finally.  Oh, you did.  I do, I do.  It's greatknights.com. 
[01:58:30]  Uh-oh.  Wait, it's got three R's.  That's the only problem.  I tried to get the one R, couldn't get it.  Is Tony the Tiger teabagging someone on the front page?  That's awful.  I like my taint sniff.  It's great.  It's great with three R's?  I know.  Well, you can also go to 101knights.com, but it's greatknights.com.  I'm not getting it.  Haiti's World Teen Model Page.  God, is this chick hot.  Okay. 
[01:59:00]  Look what accidentally popped up.  Oh, no.  Did you go to with one, did you use one R or three?  Shut up.  I'm looking at this.  You might have used four R's.  That was it.  Read and write and repetition.  Greatknights.com.  And I've got a really cool free gift.  Yeah?  Oh.  A free gift if you buy anything online.  And here's what it is.  Here's the tease.  This is an item that you find.  It's a free gift with any purchase online.  And it's an item that you find in the kitchen, that you normally find in the kitchen, but if 
[01:59:30]  you use it in the bathroom, it can give a man or a woman really intense, an intense orgasm.  Drano?  No, but it's a surprise.  I'm not letting anyone know what it is, but it's very cool.  It's normally in the kitchen.  Yeah, it's an item that you find.  It looks like this item that you find in the kitchen.  It looks like it.  Yeah, it looks like it.  That's the hint.  But if you use it in the bathroom, you can give him or her an incredible...  I know what it is. 
[02:00:00]  A frying pan?  I would say first guess, obviously, is a knife.  I'm going to say it's a little shower head that sprays, because in the kitchen you have  one that cleans.  Oh, that's a really good...  Oh.  That's really...  No.  She's not going to be mad at a shower head, though.  No, I'm not going to give a shower head.  She's cheap.  It's like probably a little...  No, it's...  No.  A little...  Opie.  Opie.  $19.95.  Oh, $19.95?  It's free.  It's very cool.  Maybe a little baster when you're basing the...  Oh, could it be that?  Do you remember the straw? 
[02:00:30]  Do you remember the straw?  I remember the straw.  Oh, yes.  The straw.  Maybe a rolling pin?  No.  No.  You take soap and a rolling pin and you attack your yam bag?  In the bedroom?  Hey, Vinny.  Hey, check out the book also on Amazon.com.  How about a sec?  Huh?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's up, bro?  We're hanging with Laura Corn today.  Hey, Laura, I think I know what the free gift is.  Okay, what is it?  Isn't it the ladle they used to dish out the chowder the other day?  The ladle.  Good call back.  Good call back.  Good call.  Hey, Laura, I got a question for you. 
[02:01:00]  Sure, sure.  My wife and I have been married a little over eight years.  All right.  And we've tried different positions and stuff, and we do 69, but she doesn't like it on top.  She likes to lie on the bed, and I lie next to her.  Okay.  And she ends up having a finale before I do.  So?  That's it.  And she wants to know why it takes me so long, and I was wondering, is there any way I could speed it up, or?  Look at that.  One guy happy.  One problem.  This guy's got the opposite problem.  Yeah, you guys should switch women, man. 
[02:01:30]  Switch gals.  Switch gals.  Now, wait a minute.  Describe this again.  She's on her back.  Right.  She's lying next to each other, side by side on the bed.  Okay, doing 69.  Right.  And she wants to know why it takes you so long while she's doing oral.  Right.  Because she ends up having a...  Well, first of all, does she have a mirror behind her butt?  What's that?  A mirror behind her rear end.  A mirror?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, because that's a visual.  Oh, of course.  See, I always tell women for oral, you should put something visually behind you while you're doing oral so he's got something... 
[02:02:00]  So he can get a little gander at her booty.  Right?  Maybe you're just better at it than she is, sir.  Maybe she's awful.  Well, Norton, have you ever licked the bottom of the inside of an ice cream cone without biting into it?  You know what?  You're absolutely...  They never get that, dude.  You're right.  They try to go all the way down because they know that that girl in high school could do it for you when you were growing up.  Right.  And they always hit it with the teeth.  And they wonder why you're going...  Stop biting it, you idiots. 
[02:02:30]  That is the biggest complaint.  Would you say that is the biggest complaint that women used to have the teeth?  Yes?  Yeah.  And they don't know.  They pretend they don't know, but they do know these passive-aggressive whores.  They know they're doing it.  Be happy it's there.  No, exactly.  No, I'm not.  Be happy it's sitting on a tongue.  Dude, you could pay $40 and get it done by a pro, by a girl that went to school for it.  With a big back and man junk.  I didn't say it was without risk.  You know what? 
[02:03:00]  I will tell you something that will speed up a man's orgasm and make it twice as intense.  Okay.  And, you know, I've talked about this on the show, but it really does work as intense.  And that is she puts something warm in her mouth.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah.  There you go.  Right?  The hot coffee, hot tea.  And all the blood, what happens is all the blood rushes up to your...  Uh-huh.  We know.  And speeds up the orgasm and makes it twice as intense.  Yeah, the hot cold tea.  So she needs to put something a little warm in her mouth while she does that to you.  Because that's got to feel good.  Scalding coffee on your junk.  And you could sue McDonald's for $2 million. 
[02:03:30]  Like the old lady who spilled out a box.  Josh from Philly, what's up?  Hot coffee.  Hey, last lady, why my wife?  She probably thinks she's dirty.  Okay.  Hold on, hold on.  And that's the biggest problem that women have.  Josh.  Yes.  She doesn't enjoy receiving or giving?  Receiving.  Oh, she doesn't enjoy receiving.  Now, why is that?  Big...  It's...  Anthony, really, a lot of women are like that.  She probably thinks she has a little something going on. 
[02:04:00]  Not feeling fresh.  Could also be abuse issues.  People have abuse issues.  Big, big time.  Absolutely.  Does she like her body?  She's starting to a lot more.  Perhaps when you come up to kiss her, it tastes like you're just bitten half a grunion.  Well, that's an absolute no-no.  Happy, uh, perhaps, uh...  Wait a minute, does she shave?  Uh, yeah, pretty close.  I mean, all of it?  Yeah, pretty close.  Okay.  Well, are you doing something wrong, too?  Do you think you are... 
[02:04:30]  Do you like doing it to her?  I love it.  You love it.  Absolutely.  So enthusiasm is the number one, you know, quality anyone should have for...  You got it.  Sorry, guys.  Don't mind us.  You know, let me ask you this.  Does she enjoy it more right after she's had a bath?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, then that's the thing.  You already know why she doesn't.  Can I get a book?  Sure.  Would you like a copy?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Have fun.  Dictionary of the stupid bath.  Thanks, buddy.  It could be right. 
[02:05:00]  Right, right, right.  If you're performing treats on a gal and flipping through the family album...  Yeah, bad.  Bad.  Well, I was just going to say the opposite, but...  Oh, you like that?  Hey, uh, Mark from D.C. writes, can you get Mother Teresa off the effing dump button over  there?  We can't hear anything Norton says.  Why?  Well, I didn't say anything that was a dump button.  They must be dumping some stuff out today for whatever reason.  No, I don't think it was me today, buddy.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Do you want to check in with the couples next?  Yeah, we've got two couples.  They are doing a bunch of spices from the menu. 
[02:05:30]  The Kitty Popsicle thing?  Yeah, the Kitty Popsicle, How to Levitate a Woman, Back for More, Liquid Ecstasy.  Eitan from New York here is checking in.  He says, does that mean I can dip my hand in scalding hot water and finish faster by himself?  Interesting concept.  Scalding, yeah, that's hot coffee and teeth on your junk.  Boy, that's got to be a recipe for pleasure. 
[02:06:00]  All of a sudden, it becomes a crumpet.  More with Laura Korn, man.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here.  I listen to the Opium 8.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here.  I listen to the Opium 8.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here, and I listen to the Opium Anthony show every day.  Yeah, right.  Hey!  All right, we're back with the Opium Anthony show, hanging with Laura Korn.  Holy S!  Oh, my gosh.  We've got some great stories, man.  She just told us a story that has to be told on the radio.  Oh, I don't know.  Can I do it on the radio?  Listen, listen. 
[02:06:30]  What's your stupid book?  What is it?  Oh, you're bad.  I'm just kidding.  Now, can I ask you, Opium, how many people have you heard?  Hold on, hold on, Laura.  No, don't BS me.  How many people have you heard that do my books that like them?  Laura, I will.  Oh, a lot.  Okay.  We've got a request for the books months after you're gone.  I will take that back, because we've been friends for many years.  Thank you.  Many years.  I'm just goofing with you, and yeah, the book does work.  The book, The Great American Sex, I am wrong.  But you just told a story that we need to tell, and we will make sure we promote the  hell out of that book if you tell the story.  Okay.  Well, this is just so...  Laura is getting sued. 
[02:07:00]  Can I set it up?  Laura is getting sued, because someone is claiming that you conspired to steal some dude's seed.  Seed.  The baby seed.  To steal his seed.  You stole someone's baby seed.  Seed, yeah.  That's what they're claiming.  Is this unbelievable or not?  Because you guys remember my old assistant, Meg.  Meg.  Yes, I do remember Meg.  I remember Opie and Rick talking to Meg whenever they were on a book, Laura Korn.  Right, because we go back, you know, when you guys were on in the afternoon. 
[02:07:30]  I talked to Meg.  Meg, you talked to Meg.  Many, many times.  Many, many, many times.  And you're telling me now she's dead.  How do I even do a...  How do I even...  Dead.  Your old assistant's dead.  She was an alcoholic, and she died of alcoholism.  Wait, she got like cirrhosis or something?  Yes, cirrhosis of the liver, and I put her in...  You know, I sent her to, you know, some recovery programs.  Yeah, it didn't work.  And I really tried to help her, and she worked part-time for me, booked me on radio stations.  And what happened? 
[02:08:00]  She, uh...  How do I even...  She what?  So...  She what?  So...  She what?  I don't know.  I even...  So on a tour about three years ago, four years ago, how do...  What?  Go ahead.  I don't know.  So your assistant died?  She died.  Of what?  Alcoholism.  Oh, you are awful.  I'm Opie.  Opie, you are horrid.  Opie.  You're a horrid man.  It works much better if the timing's there.  Yeah, that's true.  You killed me on that one.  I didn't know where you were going with it.  You killed my joke today.  You killed me. 
[02:08:30]  So she's dead.  She's dead, and some guy is suing you because you conspired to steal his baby seat.  That's what he's saying.  That's what he's saying.  All right, how does the story go?  It's just like a David Lynch movie.  It's like...  It's not even...  I don't even believe it's true.  They served me the papers right before I came on this tour.  So now, what does it say?  And the guy whose seed was stolen is suing me for conspiring with Meg to steal it.  Uh-huh.  Four years ago, I'm out on a book tour.  Right.  She's supposed to...  She's supposed to go buy my apartment and water plants. 
[02:09:00]  Water the plants.  And the way the suit was told to my brother, who's a lawyer, is that he was...  Banging on the back door.  Banging on the back door.  The old balloon, not action.  He was slamming her.  Balloon, not action.  Balloon, not action.  With your older sister, Megan, who died of the alcohol.  In my apartment.  In your apartment.  While she's passed out with her head in a plant.  Good boy, sir.  He finished.  That's just saying. 
[02:09:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Just in case they dump that.  No, that's...  No, she collects this.  Right.  She...  He...  Wait, wait.  Let's get this detailed here.  Uh, he is doing the back door.  Yes.  He's doing the balloon knot.  He finishes there so as not to cause any pregnancy or anything, I guess.  She then runs where?  Over to Crosstown.  Crosstown.  To her fertility clinic. 
[02:10:00]  Right.  And...  And...  Where it is extracted from the back.  Believe me, I didn't know any of this.  I mean, I just found out about this.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Did she...  So she...  So she steals it, I guess, and runs over and...  She held it, Opie.  She held it.  I didn't even know you...  And then ran across town.  And I guess he got some kind of a turkey baster or whatever it is.  Uh, got it out of its place back there and then put it where it belongs to make a woman  pregnant and she then got pregnant that way. 
[02:10:30]  Exactly.  She has the baby and for, uh, uh...  Now, mind you, right...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So now, the guy is claiming because she's dead and the baby who has given up for adoption  that I conspire because I write sex books.  So I must know how to steal seed.  She's dead, so he's got no one else to sue but you.  That's pretty much it.  Is it because it would happen in my apartment?  Like...  Like that...  Is that a bizarre... 
[02:11:00]  Was she held responsible for her baby?  I mean, they can't possibly...  I guess not.  Put up for adoption.  Put up for adoption.  Wow.  So, I mean, I just kind of told you that on the break.  I didn't know I was going to hear that with your audience.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Oh, my God.  If that isn't a bitches that'll get you.  Oh, wow.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  Cool.  That's sure qualified.  Boy.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  The guy seems like kind of a scumbag pursuing you.  But, boy, did he get effed over. 
[02:11:30]  Extracting the...  Oh, I thought...  I think it's terrible what happened to him.  Your old assistant there...  Did Meg ever tell you this?  She told me...  Now, here's the truth.  Right before she had the baby, she told me she went to a sperm bank, you know?  And that's what I thought.  Right before she had the baby, she broke down and went through this whole confession that  she actually did this.  That she stole this guy's...  How did she steal it?  Did she just run over to the clinic or did she...  Clenching.  Yeah.  Clenching the cheeks.  She ran over.  The old Charlie Chaplin run.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Walking like you're percolating inside after some burritos.  And that's got to be good for that kid's self-esteem.  He'll never...  Oh.  He'll never win an argument with his father, ever.  You're not getting the car.  I left you in logs.  You're the mother of that thief.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  She stole the precious booty in her booty.  I mean, it's just...  What happened there?  Let me...  I mean, I just can't...  I just...  First of all, I can't even believe that it's...  I just can't even believe this is happening. 
[02:12:30]  What kind of scumbag are you doing?  And then I...  And I will tell you, when she told me this, I pleaded her...  You know, good question, Jim.  Well, I know it.  That's why I think Meg was able to remove, let's say, and put it into something that looked  a little more illogical.  That's what I would think.  There's no way she...  No, granted, you read the papers.  They are also suing the fertility clinic.  Good.  You read the papers, though.  It said...  Did it say that she had extracted it before she went to the fertility clinic? 
[02:13:00]  That's...  That is not...  That is what their attorney told my brother, who's an attorney.  That she...  That this lawyer actually told my brother this story, and I am just...  Well, didn't the doctor notice the little flecks of chocolate in there?  Oh, God.  Is that a load or goldschlager?  Because I am, you know, I am...  You have to go through. 
[02:13:30]  I guess they think I have deep pockets or something.  Yeah.  You know, why else would they...  They're just looking to make a buck.  You know, and he claims in this paper, if you can believe this, that he did it the back  door.  Yeah.  Because he refused...  He wouldn't go near the front door.  Oh, really?  Because, you know, ooh.  Wow, she must have been mad.  Isn't that awful?  If you're turning it over for the quality.  And is he going to get on the stand and say that?  Well, there is good mortality here in this, uh, sample, but, ooh, it stinks.  I can't wait to get the court papers from this, this trial. 
[02:14:00]  I mean, I'll keep you posted.  It's horrible.  I mean, I can't possibly be convicted.  Just wrang out some Scott tissue into a Petri dish.  I can't possibly be convicted of this.  Please tell me that this is not going to happen.  This is going to be the best story ever told on our show.  Yeah, Laura, that's a great story.  I mean, it's horrible that it's happening to you, but...  And then the lady dies of alcoholism.  They give up the kid for adoption.  But, you know, the lawyer gloated to my brother saying, I am a, you know, a famous sex author,  and I knew how to tell Meg how to do this. 
[02:14:30]  That wasn't a secret in one of your, uh, books, uh, is it?  How to steal the seed in your caboose.  Didn't he get suspicious, though, after the old act was done,  when she's opening up Tupperware going,  into it?  All right, gotta catch a cab.  Bye-bye.  What a dumbbell this guy was.  I mean, I think the guy has a case against the fertility clinic.  Didn't they think something was strange?  Hmm, depends how she brought it in, is what I'm thinking.  Yeah, but it doesn't, if it comes from a fertility clinic, isn't it labeled some way? 
[02:15:00]  Isn't it?  I don't know.  It sounds to me like she just stepped in there looking like a leaky Carvel vanilla ice cream machine.  Which is pretty disgusting, if you really think about it.  And what doctor would then take that little sample and make a baby out of it?  Yeah.  That's awful.  Right out of the dumper.  I mean, this is a...  When he grows up, he's always going to want to be in the backseat of the car.  Back of the bus.  That's great. 
[02:15:30]  By the way, it's a...  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  It's a little girl.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  And she...  That's a great story.  And I'm her godmother.  And, you know, I'm...  Wait, you're the baby's godmother?  I am.  Whoa, that's twisted.  Do you see this kid?  Very sacred position in the Sicilian...  Godfather, I was transported in the hiney.  You can act like a man.  My voice is weak. 
[02:16:00]  I don't know what to do.  Secal matter on my head.  I don't know what to do, Godfather.  I don't know what to...  You can act like a man.  You came out of the...  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  I was fast over my teeth.  You know...  I gotta tell you...  Wow.  When this was hit, I sobbed. 
[02:16:30]  I cried.  I mean, I was...  I don't doubt it.  But she did, too.  Well, no, just because I'm...  The important thing is, though, that you water the plants.  Yeah, that's really where the story was going, isn't it?  Poor Laura, man.  So where does it stand?  Well, I mean, I just can't even believe that this guy thinks I did something like this.  Yeah, I don't see how they could nail you with that one. 
[02:17:00]  I mean, but this is going to be heard in the same court that let O.J. go.  All right.  All right.  Someone wants to help you with this.  Okay, okay.  Dice.  Yeah.  Dice.  What's up, Dice?  You did the Godfather wrong.  What's the matter?  Anthony.  Yeah.  When you talk to that girl, do the Godfather right.  Like what?  Like this.  Try it like that.  Do you remember a few minutes ago when you were doing it like that? 
[02:17:30]  I remember, but there was this mad one.  And he goes, you can act like a man.  Okay.  All right.  Get the gravel out of the voice.  No.  He was yelling.  No, no.  If you're going to do an impression, you've got to do it right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Give me something.  All right.  So, do you remember when you were doing it?  Yeah, I remember.  All right.  Tell me what you want me to say like that.  All right.  Do the scene where Luca Brasi comes in.  And says what?  I don't know.  He's just talking about the kid.  Now he's, you know, Luca, you're one of my... 
[02:18:00]  No, that's not anything.  No?  No.  Like when he's talking to Santino, for instance.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, give me a...  Is the chick still there?  Yeah, Lori.  Yeah, hi.  Were you doing the Godfather too?  No.  No, but I can if you want me to.  So you're telling us an interesting story.  Let me hear you do the Godfather.  Hey, I'm the Godfather.  How you doing?  And you think...  What happened there?  You what?  What's your name?  My name is Laura. 
[02:18:30]  No, the other one.  That's it.  That's it.  Corn?  Yeah, corn.  Yeah, that's me.  Santino.  You see the way I said that?  Right.  Anthony.  Yeah, we heard it like that.  We heard that.  Is this really, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I love you.  Yeah, I don't need no big introduction, honey.  I just...  You know what I mean?  I just joined right in.  Thanks.  You don't give me enough Godfather.  Give me a little more.  Well, how much you want?  I just want to hear it because you're barely saying anything.  I did the whole word.  All right.  Let me do it again.  All right.  Let me weigh in.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:19:00]  Santino.  Geez, you going to do it all day?  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.  You want a different word?  Give us a different word.  Look how they massacred my boy.  Okay.  That's good, right?  I don't know if that's the exact line.  But that was a lot better because now you're trying.  But then when he smacked around his...  Where does it always come to violence?  Frankie Fontaine.  Where does it always come to violence?  Johnny Fontaine.  Johnny Fontaine.  When he smacked him around, he goes, you're going to act like a man. 
[02:19:30]  He yells.  You see, now you're trying.  Now I respect you.  Before, like, you were just throwing it out there.  You've got millions of people.  You're all over the world already.  Dice, did you ever deliver your seed in the back door and then have the girl take it out  and put it in the front so she could have a baby that is Dice's kid?  The back door.  Right.  You mean like the glutamous maximus part?  Yeah.  Right.  You see how I've been practicing the radio technology?  Very nice.  You know what I mean? 
[02:20:00]  I only use that word for people that don't understand sophisticated language like glutamous maximus.  Right, of course.  You know what I mean?  They understand, though.  Yeah.  But what I normally do, I normally go in there first.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And I put, like, because they're very close together.  Yeah.  It's like, what do you call the...  that arifice next to the vaginal thing? 
[02:20:30]  Do we call it the balloon knot?  Balloon knot.  All right.  Yeah.  So let's say you balloon knot.  Let's say you take your...  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  It's like, the other night, I'm doing that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, I'm with this chick, and I'm, you know, I'm balloon knot-nut.  So she says to me, why you got your thing in my balloon knot? 
[02:21:00]  So I says, Nicky was a rat because Sonny Black says Nicky was a rat.  You see what I'm saying?  So this way, she doesn't really know what I'm thinking.  Oh, he's confused.  You see what I just did there?  Yeah, yeah.  And, like, like, two nights ago, I'm with this other chick.  Right.  And I'm balloon knot, you know, right?  Yeah, right.  So she says to me like this, she goes, did you notice what I even said there? 
[02:21:30]  What?  When I just did that second one.  No.  I said, I'm thinking about this chick's balloon knot.  Oh, okay.  So she says, why you thinking about my balloon knot?  So I says, I got on.  You see what I'm doing there?  Not at all.  Well, I can't use the real punchline because I'm on the air.  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  All right.  Now, a lot of people that just don't do it, they don't even know what the balloon knot is.  That's why I keep saying... 
[02:22:00]  Na-na-na, everyone.  Yeah, it's a na-na.  Na-na-na, everyone knows what the balloon knot is.  You know what I did today for you, Anthony?  What?  I spoke to all the skippers, all the bosses.  You know what that means?  No.  You have no idea, my friend.  You see?  Nice.  Do you remember...  Wait a minute.  When I did that other one, I think this guy got the balloon knot.  Do you remember that part?  Yeah, I remember.  Now, let me ask you a question.  You're an adult, right?  Uh-huh.  You have an EQ, right? 
[02:22:30]  You're a pretty smart guy.  Okay.  Okay?  And don't be stupid.  Okay.  You're a pretty smart guy, right?  Yeah.  So, how did this girl, when she turned around to me, then I went into the girl character and said,  Why are you thinking about my balloon knot?  Yeah.  Right?  How didn't you ask me, how did she know I was thinking about it?  Dice.  How didn't...  Why didn't you ask me that part?  Because I wasn't listening, really. 
[02:23:00]  Well, why weren't you listening?  Because you're kind of babbling.  I'm not babbling.  Dice, I thought you called to give me some advice because of my situation.  About what?  You missed a great story.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, what happened to you?  You were the balloon knot chick?  Yeah.  It's not about you, you say.  What kind of...  Let me ask you this.  You were brought into this world by two people.  They carried you in their arms, right?  Well, not thinking about the baby we're talking about.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[02:23:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Now, you were out of a test tube.  Is that what you're saying?  I'm being sued for something I didn't do.  Dice, if you could listen for a second, I'll explain it real quick.  Okay.  She has a...  She had somebody that booked her on radio shows.  Her assistant, this girl Meg.  She, uh...  This girl Meg...  I just got to tell my kids over here.  He came here to...  Do me a favor.  Go play in the garage or something.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Our couples are checking in, by the way. 
[02:24:00]  I'm a good father.  All right, guys.  The garage was like a toy.  Nice.  Quick, quick.  Here is...  Here's what happened.  So Meg, her assistant, is at Laura's house when Laura's not there.  She's with a guy.  The guy plows her in the balloon knot, right?  Yeah.  The guy lets go, okay?  She takes the byproduct of that letting go in the balloon knot, runs to a fertility clinic.  The doctor takes it out of there, puts it in the other place, and she becomes pregnant.  Then the woman has the kid.  Then she dies of alcoholism a few years later. 
[02:24:30]  And now the guy is suing Laura Korn for conspiracy to steal his seed.  Uh-huh.  So what's the problem?  What's the guy?  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Yeah.  And don't be stupid.  I'm innocent.  You're innocent in a way.  She didn't help.  You stole this guy's...  No!  The other girl stole it in her clenched cheeks.  Yeah.  So basically you took the balloon knot pudding...  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  And you put it in the other... 
[02:25:00]  And they put it in the other place.  I didn't do anything.  Well, why couldn't you do it yourself?  No, it was her assistant.  You know what I mean?  Because I know when I expose my...  What do you call the word for...  The seed.  The seed.  I don't know if that's going to affect the people listening.  I don't know.  All right.  The seed.  Okay?  Now, I normally do that 52 ounces at a clip.  You know what I mean?  So there's plenty to go around.  52 ounces.  Yeah, I'm just missing half a gallon. 
[02:25:30]  But that's because I'm a little older now.  It actually takes me 19 minutes to finish once I start.  Okay.  Did you ever have that much all over you?  I love you, skank.  Don't start with me today.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  What did I tell you?  I am talking about something here.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Don't start with me on this one.  Quiet.  I'm trying to give an intellectual answer to something. 
[02:26:00]  Quiet.  Quiet.  All right.  Quiet.  Maybe you talk a little while.  Quiet.  Maybe you talk.  Maybe I shouldn't talk.  Maybe it should all be about you.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Go ahead, Laura.  So what did you do with, like, the other 50 ounces?  I'm over here now.  No, I'm just here on a book tour talking about my new book.  Quiet.  What kind of book you put on?  Quiet.  Quiet.  The Great American Sex...  Be more funny.  The Great American Sex Diet, where the only thing you nibble on is your partner.  Be more funny. 
[02:26:30]  It's basically a book about sex.  Shut up, Demi.  Having lots of sex.  Shut up, Demi.  Great sex.  Shut up, Demi.  You're talking to a tape now, honey.  What are you, an idiot?  What kind of book could you write if you don't even know the difference between me and a tape?  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  So, how you doing?  Hey, ask me.  Hey, Dice.  What's your name?  Hey, suck at Dice.  Oh.  The master chef is here.  I've been you at home.

Doing a Dice impression.  Who?  That's Frenchie.  I thought that was you, ain't it?  That's what I say.  French guy.  He does you as good as you.  Who says to who do you, huh?  Who?  How you doing?  Who?  Who says to who do you, huh?  Who say who to what?  Huh?  What?  Who?  You?  No, because of you.  Oh, kid yourself.  I didn't know that was you.  I'm not, I'm not.

Doing it all as quickly as possible.  What do you do with your tongue?  Do you do it with my tongue?  Yeah, what do you, what kind of different?  All right, well, what I like to do, I like to get the chick's ass, like, jacked up all  the way.  Yeah.  And then, oh, I can't say these words.  These are radio technology words. 
[02:28:00]  No, no, no, no.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Where you go like, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, you know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  I do.

Normally, you know, when I bang a chick, I like to bang a Vegas style.  Vegas?  Vegas style.  Yeah.  Okay.  I actually have a spice on her menu called Better Than Vegas, baby.  And maybe you can tell us about it next time you call, Dice.  That's what I do.  Dicey, we got to go.  Hold on, because we got some people who've done some of my sex tricks coming up.

Through the panties, yes?  Mariton.  Oh, um, Mariton.  When was the last time your husband did something like that?  Oh, my husband.  Oh, not yet.  Boyfriend.  John, my, uh, probably a month.  Oh, so he has done that?  Yeah.  Okay, so you did, on her menu, you did a spice called, what's the number for 911, yes? 
[02:33:30]  Ah, you know what you do?  You get a lot of saliva mixed in, and it's almost like you're making tea in your mouth.  With the, uh, whatever's in there.  Okay, so he did that, and then didn't you get on, didn't he do something else for you?  Um, well, actually, he did something that I didn't expect.  Oh, punched you in the face.  He put it in the balloon nut and said, this one's for Norton.  He what, what, what, what, what?  He put it in the balloon nut and said, this one's for Norton. 
[02:34:00]  Nice!  He got the fish eye.  God bless him.  Well, run to the sperm clinic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please tell me it really hurt.  Please.  Uh, Norton, it did.  Oh, boy, sir.  Okay, now, so, now, wait a minute.  So, he did, he did.  He licked my kitty, and then he licked my balloon nut, and then he put it in.  Wow.  Okay, and then you turned around, and you took charge, didn't you?  And then you did the, the, the spice, what's the number for 911, yes? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  And how, how did that work?  Nice.  Nice?  I got a chin full of milk.  Oh, my God!  Like a good little kitty.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Wowie.  Can you, can you put him on for a second?

It was good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, it was good.  Was it great or good?  It was great.  What a professional you are.  Right in the balloon nut. 
[02:35:00]  Good man's turn.  Uh, she actually, John?  Yeah.  She actually, uh, did the, what's the number for 911?  Finishing on her face is a great move.  Always.  That's a great move, especially after the balloon nut.  Yeah, especially if they're crying.  Oh, yeah.  Which part, which is the, which technique did you like the best?  John?  John?  It was, what's going on in the background?  Is that the pink lipstick?  That's my dog going crazy.  Licking off the peanut butter over here.  Oh, my God. 
[02:35:30]  Well.  I gotta go, my dog's going crazy.  All right.  Why's your dog going crazy?  Here, she wants to go out.  Here, talk to Merrick.  All right.  I'm sorry.  He wanted to say, when I put his yam bag in my mouth, he'd like that.  Hey, there you go.  How about that?  Well, most guys do.  Should I just say one thing real quick?  Sure.  I just wanted to talk to Norton.  He has something that he has to tell.  Hello?  Yes, sir.  Norton?  Yes, sir.  What are you doing there? 
[02:36:00]  What are you doing?  I'm just trying to say, my pick-up line for girls is a handful of roofies and a club full  of young girls.  Good man.  Good man.  What is he doing there when they're having sex?  Huh?  Did you watch them have sex?  Am I watching them?  What?  You know, they're a waste of time.  Yeah.  I'll bet what he was doing while they were going out of the other room.  He was probably whacking the dog's bag.  Right.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Big Rottweiler with his paws on your shoulders. 
[02:36:30]  Big Happy Roddy.  Happily slobbering on you like hooch.  Do we have the other couple?  Yeah.  Ken and Liz.  All right.  Hello?  And they hung up.  Oh, God.  Is this a connection problem?  I don't know.  What was the other technique?  Okay, so Ben and Liz were doing the Kitty Popsicle.  She did not do the Kitty Popsicle.  What is the Kitty Popsicle?  That's K-I-T-T-Y.  We're going to be talking about the Kitty Popsicle.  Although Anthony's warning me not to.  Anyway, the Kitty Popsicle.  And let me think.  What else? 
[02:37:00]  I think he did How to Levitate a Woman.  That spice from his menu.  How to Levitate a Woman.  How would you levitate a woman?  How to Levitate a Woman.  I don't know.  A rope and a stool work size.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Levitate.  I guess.  Huh.  You're right.  Then I go through the death rows like a goose.  The Japanese gentleman's hopping back.  Let's go back.  Now, this is a really cool technique that you do with a toy. 
[02:37:30]  Remember when I talked about popping her clutch the last time I was here?  Oh, yeah.  Popping her clutch.  Yeah.  You remember that one?  Yeah.  I don't remember that one, though.  Yeah.  It's something to do with a...  With a toy.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't remember that one.  Popping her clutch.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can definitely pop her clutch.  I have a rod going here.  Ah.  I love that.  Oh, she tells you when she's just about to have the O.  He must be.  He pays attention.  And then you...  Right?  Yeah.  No.  And then you've got to pop it.  So she tells you when she's about to have the O. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  You've got the vibrator on there.  Right.  All right.  So then...  A mitt full of Crisco and you drive it home.  Yeah.  You're the name of the people of Rome.  Yeah.  I forgot.  What happens?  Oh, God.  You had it...  Oh, vibrator.  Okay.  So...  Oh, that's great.  All right.  So you pop her clutch.  So you...  Right at the...  So right when she starts to have an orgasm, you turn the vibrator off.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, off.  And then you turn it on.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a second. 
[02:38:30]  Then you turn it off.  Then you turn it on.  Right.  Yeah.  And you can actually extend a woman's orgasm.  Very nice.  Let's talk to Ken and Liz.  Why bother?  No more dice.  He did so well the first time for us today.  Yeah.  Ken and Liz, what's up?  Hey, Ken.  Ken and Beth.  Hi.  Oh, it's Ken and Beth.  Yeah.  Oh, Ken and Beth.  I'm sorry.  Hey, we kept losing you.  What happened?  Well, he killed me with the case of Don't Make Your Brown Eyes Blue and then I had to  sit through dice for a while.  He killed what was left of the mood and found me by myself. 
[02:39:00]  Beth is gone?  Yeah.  You're kidding.  What happened?  Well, she took her money and left.  No.  She had to go to work.  Oh, damn.  So how did it go?  It went well.  Did you like the Kitty Popsicle?  Yeah.  I thought it was great.  I wish Beth was here to tell you how she liked it.  Oh.  But did she really get into it?  Oh, yes.  What is it?  Yeah.  More than usual there?  Well, that was something new.  Yeah.  Totally new. 
[02:39:30]  And now do you understand why?  Because I can't really reveal this because it is too explicit.  Why it's called the Kitty Popsicle?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty hot, eh?  Yeah.  Damn.  Damn.  I think I know what it is.  Is it?  Yeah, we talked with the Kitty Popsicle.  You have?  Oh, well.  Well, that's another story.  Well, glad you had fun.  Now, didn't I give you a technique to do on her?  Let's talk about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And which one did I give you?  Oh, did you do the vibrator on the back?  No, no.  On the back?  On the back?  No.  No, we did warm liquids. 
[02:40:00]  You did the one?  Probably not.  Oh, warm liquid things here.  And how did she respond to that?  Uh, well.  You did to her what, like, two dogs of meat on the street would do.  No, no.  Not in my neighborhood.  No, just, uh, she'll have to tell you.  I don't know.  You've got to get in there and take right in.  But what was yours?  Get a good one.  I warmed up, uh, my mouth. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah?  And, uh...  With tea or whatever, right?  Yeah, and then...  Right.  Well, she was looking the other way on all fours.  Uh-huh.  Um...  Yeah, you dug in.  Yeah, I dug in.  All right.  Good for you.  And her response?  Her response was, uh, violent at times.  Violent?  Uh, it was good.  In a good way?  Violent at times in a good way?  Yeah, it got the, uh, popsicle receptacle ready.  These techniques must have worked, because both our couples are brain dead.  All the blood...  Yeah, they just had...  Well, that was Dice Clay that did that.  Wait, is the kitty popsicle? 
[02:41:00]  I think I'm going to guess.  I...  I...  Uh, it's too dirty.  I can't...  Gosh!  No, it's hot.  All right.  Thank you, Ken.  You got it.  All right.  They had fun.  I love them.  What do you do if you're a couple...  What do you do if you're a couple, though, and you catch one peeking at the other's menu?  Because I know I'd peek while she was at work.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hubbler, hubbler.  But listen, no, no, be honest.  Isn't it cool?  Because the master chef here, he...  I just want to...  Because he's really into this.  Oh, don't worry about fancy.  He's totally... 
[02:41:30]  Are you not into the...  Shut up.  Come on.  Yeah, shut your heart.  Because he's a chef, and since he's a chef, and I consider...  And a chef.  What do you think of the two menus?  Be honest.  I mean, you...  Well...  Yes.  They suck!  God damn it.  No, they're cool.  They're cool.  All right.  Let's take some more phone calls here.  Let's take some more phone calls.  Yeah, why not?  Let's see what Beth has.  Beth.  Hey, what's up?  Help us out.  We were doing so well with this show, and something went horribly wrong.  Took a bad turn. 
[02:42:00]  What do you got for Laura Korn?  Okay.  Okay, so here's my question.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  Only...  Okay, when my husband and I are doing it, only when I'm on top in, like, this crazy-ass  position...  Yeah.  Does it...  Okay.  So when he, I guess, climaxes...  Uh-huh.  ...the word I want, when he climaxes, it is, like, such an intense climax that you just  can't take it anymore?  Ooh.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Well, you don't have to.  He's climaxed.  Like, it's like it won't stop. 
[02:42:30]  What?  He won't stop?  It's such an incredible feeling, and it just won't stop, and you just can't take it anymore  because it won't stop.  What?  You have this feeling?  No, well, he does.  That's how he describes it.  Oh, okay.  Huh.  Because of this position?  I don't know if it's the position.  That's why I'm calling you, is how do I do it to him all the time?  Because it only happens once in a while.  Oh, oh, oh.  So you are in female superior, yes?  Yes.  Female superior.  You're on top.  Like, turned around backwards.  Oh, you turned around backwards.  Backwards. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  That's good.  That's right.  Oh, so it's the visual, yes?  Puts the right angle on the mule.  Yeah, on the mule.  And he doesn't have to look at your dumb face.  And it hurts him?  And you know what?  While he has an orgasm, you want to intense it?  You want to make it even more intense?  Oh, look at it.  It gets too intense.  No, no, no.  Well, make it even crazier.  Pull his toes at the same time.  Oh, stop it.  And then say the little piggy, and he'll go,  That's awful.  First of all, to get to his toes, she has to lean forward, and ouch. 
[02:43:30]  No, no, no.  Do I tell you, the toe bone is connected to the big bone.  I am absolutely not going to believe that for a second.  No, it's in the Kama Sutra.  And it absolutely is the truth.  If you have a woman in reverse,  The goddamn Kami's got nothing to do with it.  You are in reverse, Anthony.  And right when you, you know, she's bouncing.  If she leans forward, while, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You don't know the pain that's involved there.  That gets pretty rigid. 
[02:44:00]  No, no, no.  You've got to position yourself right where you're leaning forward.  A girl can't lean forward that much.  No, yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, they can.  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Why not?  While he's having to pull his toes, I swear to God.  You're right.  I'm fine, Matt.  I'm fine, Matt.  And if he's a good try, Matt.  And if he, does he a toe man, if you can suck him, that's even better.  Oh, no.  They're pretty nasty.  I don't think I'm sucking them.  How about if she's facing him, and he's about to do it.  Maybe she could tweak his ear like Carol Burnett's.  Yeah, that's great. 
[02:44:30]  I will say, though, I've had my toes sucked, and she is right.  My toes are clean.  I'm clean.  I'm Kenny clean.  I have a lot of diseases, but I wash my feet.  I'll give you a hep C, but my feet don't stink.  But it really does feel good.  I mean, I'm telling you, it is in the Kama Sutra.  It's a hot technique.  Check it out.  Where's the Kama Sutra from?  The Kama Sutra is like a zillion.  From India?  Yeah.  Who cares what these yak riders think about sex?  They smell.  I bet you nothing is oral. 
[02:45:00]  All right, Beth.  Oh, you're great.  Beth, would you like a copy of The Great American Sex Diet?  Yes, I would.  Excellent.  Go on it.  There's nothing more exciting than giving him a boyfriend.  She still wants to know why her boyfriend hurts when he completes stuff.  Right, right.  It's so, so, so intense.  He doesn't hurt, does he?  Yeah, he hurts.  Yes, that's why she, you know, I don't have the answer.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Yeah, I do.  It's like such an intense orgasm, it hurts.  Exactly.  Women have that, too.  Yeah, well, I'm not saying that I haven't had it, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, is that a good thing or a bad thing? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, no, it's a good, it's like, I don't know.  It hurts so good.  It's just such an incredible feeling that you just can't take it anymore.  Well, how often do you get in that position?  Well, see, now, I don't get it in that position.  I only get it orally.  Are you sure he's not saying that just to get you off?  Like, oh, I can't take it anymore.  You've got to get off.  No, you can tell.  You can tell because it's just, yeah, you can tell.  I've used that excuse before.  All right, Beth.  All right, enjoy the book, okay?  All right, now, where do I get it?  Well, The Great American Sex Diet.  We're going to send you a copy.  Yeah, we'll send you a copy. 
[02:46:00]  Very cool for Valentine's Day.  All right, when we get back, we're going to play What Do We Learn Next?  Yes.  Lord, what do you want to give out real fast?  The 800 number for the book?  1-800-547-BONK, B-O-N-K.  Great night.  Good gift for Valentine's Day, right?  Yeah, greatnights.com.  I'm also the author of 101 Nights of Great Sex.  What do you...  All right, we've got to go.  101 Nights of Great Sex, 101 Nights of Great Romance,  which, by the way, is on Britney Spears' nightstand.  It was just shot.  They went into her bedroom and took a picture,  and guess what's on her nightstand? 
[02:46:30]  A copy of 101 Nights of Great Romance.  I'm sure it's usually the clam is lip-syncing.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  All right, just a few minutes left in the show today.  Kristen's back in the studio.  She drove all the way from Cleveland to get her pictures redone by Rick  for the Naughty Nighting contest,  and her new pictures are up on opianthony.com. 
[02:47:00]  And I must say, you made the right choice driving all the way from Cleveland  because these pictures are even hotter than the first set you did.  A lot more satisfied, definitely.  Which one's the point?  What number?  41.  EJ.  EJ.  And now you guys are going back to Cleveland?  Yes, we are.  Wow, look at that butt shot.  Nice!  There you go!  Richard, look at the hiney shot.  By the way, you can still qualify for the Naughty Nighting contest all this week,  and then we'll start voting next week, all right?  Wow, what chic. 
[02:47:30]  Very nice.  Very nice butt.  Very nice everything there.  Where's the Rick Kroll picture?  It's shot number four, page one.  Yeah, it was in there.  Yeah, there's the Kroll.  That's the obvious Kroll picture.  Oh, shot number four, page one.  Yeah, her hand.  We'll get the Britney Spears one as well.  The famous one.  I hope the boyfriend makes the other guy drive and just hits it in the back seat.  Now, how does your thing feel down there?  It went away after a while, but yeah.  How long did it tingle for?  What the hell happened there?  Well, I was curious because I'm...  She got pierced? 
[02:48:00]  No, about a week ago.  You know, these companies always send me products to try,  and I didn't know if I really...  I'd been kind of like rejecting this product for about a year,  and I thought, you know what, what's wrong with me?  Why don't I just, you know, try this brand?  So I did, and it's Vigel,  and it's not Viacream.  It's a product called Vigel.  So I put some on, and I had multiples.  So I was like, whoa.  This happened one week ago today,  and so I had sex over the weekend.  I tried it again, and man, he, my boyfriend, had multiples. 
[02:48:30]  So I gave a little of her...  I said, go into the bathroom and try this and see if you like it,  because I don't know.  So she went in, and she put the Vigel on herself  while she had the pictures taken,  and you said it...  It feels like a peppermint patty.  That's exactly what it makes.  And she said just...  It totally tingles, like, for hours.  And it's called Vigel?  It's called Vigel.  I'm selling it on my website.  That's why you don't tune the show off.  Because it didn't make it Vigel.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  I'm telling you... 
[02:49:00]  Interesting.  It's unbelievable.  It can put you definitely in the mood.  I've never recommended,  never put my name to a product,  but I'm doing it.  You can check it out on the web,  or call my 1-800-547-BONK.  But you liked it.  Yes.  It's really amazing.  You know what else works, Laura,  to get a gentleman in the mood?  Thank you, sweetie.  That gets a gentleman ready.  Prison lube.  Prison lube.  Yeah.  Well, Kristen, have a safe trip back to Cleveland.  She's a pretty...  Yes, thank you.  I think you've got great pictures.  You like your pictures?  Yes.  All right, good.  They're very cool.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Good.  Jersey Gary writes,  No more aluminum seats for Sully at the Pats game.  He also learned never to have backdoor sex  in Laura Korn's apartment when she's not there.  And if your chick does the Charlie Chaplin walk  and looks like a leaking Carvel machine  after backdoor sex,  she's holding the Goldschlager Mule Juice Cocktail.  Wow.  Goldschlager went through.

Hey, guys.  Today I learned not to trust a girl  when she offers the balloon knot.  Yeah.  And I learned Norton inspires backdoor action.  Yes.  All right.  Later, guys.  See, it wasn't that bad today after all.  Anthony!  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Yo.  Yeah, I learned the best way to levitate a woman  is with a rope and a stool.  Yeah, if I get a copy of that book, 
[02:51:00]  I got some problems.  Sure.  I got some problems.  My girl's got the problems.  Yeah.  Is she a little or no desire?  No.  She'll be on top,  and she'll finish like two or three times.  Right.  And then she'll be like,  oh, you know,  she wants to be a missionary.  Right.  And then she just lays there.  All right, listen.  We don't have time,  so Laura, we'll give you...  Yeah, sure.  You got one more book?  The Great American Sex Diet.  All right, hold on, bro.  Enjoy.  Give Anthony a book on line eight.  Stacy, what's up?  I learned that you can cultivate a baby
