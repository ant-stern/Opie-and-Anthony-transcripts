<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a caller, Jason from Orlando, requesting increasingly explicit sexual acts from a female guest.  This culminated in a request for a woman to defecate on a plate, microwave it, and roll around in it while yelling "donkey sausage."  Raquel, a Radio Shack employee who called in, agreed to participate.  On air, she performed the requested actions, yelling "donkey sausage" in her Radio Shack and masturbating while describing the store and its customers.  The hosts and Raquel engaged in sexually suggestive banter, also discussing Radio Shack products and satellite radio services, including Howard Stern's competition.  Later, Raquel's emails were read, revealing her disappointment with previous female guests (porn stars Taylor and Mia) during a "Lesbian for a Day" segment and regret about mentioning her employment.  A heated exchange ensued, culminating in Raquel hanging up.  The hosts then discussed the segment and recounted previous outrageous incidents involving female guests.

The show then featured a lengthy interaction with Raquel, who had contacted them hoping for a position and to contribute ideas.  Initially shy, she quickly revealed a manipulative and aggressive personality, criticizing women in radio, particularly Robin Quivers.  The hosts expressed negative opinions about women in radio and rejected Raquel's application, leading to a heated exchange where Taylor and Mia insulted Raquel's appearance.  A back-and-forth argument about attractiveness followed, with both women making disparaging remarks about each other's bodies.  This transitioned into the "fart game," a recurring segment where participants guessed the source of various farts played on air. Opie, Anthony, Ben (the producer), and Steve (another staff member) participated.  The show concluded with further banter and XM radio promotions.

Next, the show focused on bizarre taxi experiences. Opie recounted being tricked by an unlicensed taxi driver and a concerning experience in the Bahamas where the driver stopped to socialize and smoke marijuana.  Rich Voss (filling in for Jim Norton) participated in the discussion, which also covered the dangers of taxi rides in other countries (a caller, Chris, described a high-speed, drug-fueled ride in Kenya).  Opie discussed his upcoming trip to Atlantis with his children and his divorce after a trip to Aruba, along with his methods of keeping his daughters safe on the beach.  A caller's taxi story was revealed to be from *The Amazing Race*.  The show then interviewed Al Jorgensen of Ministry, with Joe Rogan and Bill Burr briefly present in the studio. Jorgensen recounted anecdotes from his life and career, including his views on modern music, experiences with the religious right (using the alias "Al-Qaeda"), his Graceland wedding,  a missing toe (lost due to a neglected splinter), blowing up his tour bus, and a graphic description of a brown recluse spider bite and subsequent medical procedure.  Vulgar and offensive language was used throughout this segment.

A story about a tour bus incident involving the hosts and Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers was recounted.  They ignited a large firework on the bus, resulting in a fire and police involvement, costing them $63,000 in damages.  Al Jorgensen, who was a guest in the studio, heard some of his early embarrassing music played. The final segment featured a comedian, "Schizo Bill," who identified as schizophrenic. Bill recounted winning $50,000 in the lottery and spending it on more lottery tickets, discussed shock treatments, medication struggles, and humorous situations stemming from his schizophrenia.  He plugged his MySpace page.  Bill Burr and Jim Norton were also in the studio.  The segment involved playful banter, interruptions, and attempts to get Bill to perform his stand-up routine, which included jokes about stalking, suicide, and his mental hospital experiences.  The hosts pointed out a large scar on his neck.  Schizo Bill’s erratic behavior, including hallucinations, inconsistent narratives, and digressions, dominated the segment.  He showed the hosts a stuffed animal with its head cut off and abruptly left the studio.  The closing moments included snippets from Ron and Fez and commercials.

[00:01:30]  Let me see those boobies. 
[00:02:00]  Let me see those boobies. 
[00:02:30]  Let me see those boobies.  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  You tell which is the worst. 
[00:05:00]  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  Jason from Orlando.  What's up, Jason?  What up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, Jace.  Nah, just chillin'.  I just turned y'all on yesterday.  And y'all are pretty fucked up, man.  I dig this shit.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in the microwave and put that on the air? 
[00:05:30]  I want shit like that, dude.  I want some fucked up shit.  You know, I think we might take that and run with it.  All right.  The only problem is we don't have a microwave in here, but just shitting on the plate, we could probably arrange.  Do that and then have her roll around in it and screaming donkey sausage, donkey sausage.  Shit like that, you know?  Make me laugh.  Yeah, but, sir, how many times has that been done?  The chick was shitting on the plate running around yelling donkey sausage.  We want something different.  Why do you want to hear that?  I don't know.  Just some shit I ain't never heard before. 
[00:06:00]  This is a new wave of radio, man.  Talk radio.  This is XM radio.  I want to hear some fucked up shit.  I haven't heard that before.  That's for sure.  All right, people, man.  Peace out.  Do your show.  Make me laugh, man.  All right.  I like you, Jason.  You're all right.  You call back any time.  All right, dude.  Thanks.  Bye, fella.  Ben, write that down.  We need to get a girl in here to shit on a plate, and then we're going to put it in  a microwave.  And we need a microwave.  She's got a roll in it to yell donkey sausage.  Run around yelling donkey sausage.  That's great.  That's got to be a promo. 
[00:06:30]  I have no idea what that's all about.  I want that to happen.  All right.  Let's say hi to Raquel.  Raquel?  That would be me.  Hi.  Do you want to shit on a plate for us?  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Donkey sausage.  We'll microwave it if you give us the proper amount of time.  Nice.  New Jim and Dean's donkey sausage.  Raquel, can you do us a favor?  Just run around your room really fast, just yelling donkey sausage, donkey sausage.  I want to see if this has potential.  See what it sounds like?  Yeah.  I could do that. 
[00:07:00]  I could do that.  Run around and say donkey sausage.  Yeah.  Yell it, though.  Yeah, yell it.  And yell it all silly.  Okay.  Go ahead.  All right.  Hold on one second.  All right.  This is what this guy in Orlando wants to hear.  Okay.  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There might be something there.  There's something oddly attractive about that.  That kid wasn't whistling Dixie.  Oh, you want to hear something really funny?  All right.  That is that I'm running around in my store, Radio Shack, and we're open, so there's customers  in the store.  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[00:07:30]  We ought to sell them donkey sausage.  It's probably better than the rest of those shitty products.  Everything I ever bought from Radio Shack broke.  At least the donkey sausage you can put on your chest and whack off under a glass table  with.  Yeah.  I'm not a big fan of the Radio Shack myself.  It stinks.  Oh, boy.  I really am not.  Let me cross that potential client off the list.  Radio Shack, we've got answers.  The question is, why does everything you sell suck?  You've got questions?  You make some real bad decisions about the merchandise you sell.  Wait.  That doesn't wait. 
[00:08:00]  That doesn't?  That doesn't?  I could get a Dell computer, but I want a Tandy 80.  For me, you may have questions.  I don't always have the goddamn answer.  That's a good point.  Ah, that's a good slogan.  Do you work at a Radio Shack in New York?  No, in Jersey.  Oh, all right.  I grew up in Jersey.  There's a little Radio Shack in Jersey.  You know what?  Not all the Radio Shacks in Jersey are bad.  No?  So you come into mine, you actually get a good time.  Yeah.  That's right.  Because I've got you guys pumping in the background, you know.  Wow.  So how many XM radios have you sold out of Radio Shack? 
[00:08:30]  Well, we don't have XM yet.  Yeah, no shit.  I know.  You guys sell the little doggy units.  No shit.  The crap Howard Stern is on.  Well, not yet, honey.  Not yet.  He made a great decision, sure.  Hey, did you see that terrible commercial on the game last night for the other company  with the dog in the backseat of the car?  Horrid.  Horrid.  No.  What was it?  For serious?  What was the commercial?  There's a dog riding in the back of the car driving around New York.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Like I was watching a ball game last night. 
[00:09:00]  Like I cared about watching baseball last night.  Well, Ben, what'd the little doggy do?  I don't know.  He was just barking and...  Arf!  Oh, I get it.  You know what the mistake Howard made?  Thinking he's bigger than this whole satellite radio thing?  He's just not.  When the consumer goes to the Best Buy in the Circuit City, they're going to make their  decision on the choices, and it's not going to come down to one thing.  You know, XM satellite radio signing Major League Baseball is huge, and then you add  it to everything else they're doing, and it just makes your decision that much more  obvious.  Well, you know what really bugs me about the serious thing is that they play the same 
[00:09:30]  crap over and over and over again.  It's no different than goddamn regular radio.  There you go.  There you go.  Not to mention the satellite unit that you get from Sirius.  Looks like an X-ray machine on your dashboard.  They look like a tampon box.  They are awful, aren't they?  The size of a tampon box.  Yeah.  All right.  So what do you want to do today, Raquel?  Well, what I told them is I'd be willing to play what's in my pants, and trust me, what's  in my pants is damn sexy. 
[00:10:00]  Ooh.  Why do you say that?  Because I'm fucking hot.  Is it a realistic 900 channel scanner?  For $99.95?  No?  No, no, no.  Realistic.  I love that.  No one can carry realistic anymore.  I know.  The old days I'm talking about.  Oh, the old days, the old days.  Actually, that's when I used to play you guys in the store was in the old days.  They used to just sell.  Now, Radio Shack has been trying to get other products, outside products, into the store  because their own products were such crap. 
[00:10:30]  If you remember the ancient days when the Commodore 64 was out, that computer, the Atari 800s, Radio  Shack had the Tandy computer line.  I have pictures of these things and commercials of the old computers.  Yeah.  People on TV in their old 80s outfits that look like they should belong in the fucking zoo  or something.  It was the TRS-80 that the computer that Radio Shack sold. 
[00:11:00]  And it was so bad.  You could do nothing with it.  There were no games you could play on it.  Nothing.  It was the worst piece of crap.  And they sold this stuff, you know, well into the time where other places were selling  good computers.  Yes.  And then they finally realized maybe we ought to sell some Hewlett Packers or something.  Maybe we should get with the time so people stop returning the shit that they buy from  us.  Not a big fan of the Radio Shack.  No.  Why are you working there?  Well, maybe if you came into my Radio Shack, you'd change your mind.  You know what Radio Shack was good for?  If you wanted to, like once I decided I had a schematic to solder together a stun gun. 
[00:11:30]  And I built a stun gun.  And I hit my girlfriend with it.  Good boy.  To see if it worked.  She was pissed.  But I assumed it wasn't going to work because I made it, you know.  I soldered it all together.  But if you're going to get electronic stuff, there, you go to Radio Shack.  If you want to buy stuff that's built, ugh.  No, we've got cool stuff now.  No, you don't.  Oh, you walk into there on Christmas and they got those cheap radio controlled cars all  over the place that break in a day.  You know what Radio Shack's all about now? 
[00:12:00]  What?  What?  Cell phones.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That's where I buy my cell phone.  You don't go to the place that sells cell phones.  It's cheaper here.  I'm sure it is.  Are you a pretty girl?  You're a pretty girl?  I'm hot.  I'm fucking gorgeous.  What do you look like?  I'm Puerto Rican.  I like that.  There you go.  What part of Jersey?  North, south, or central?  Central.  Okay.  Central.  Don't want to give too much because I guarantee there's a couple of Radio Shack people listening  right now.  Yeah, no, no.  Understandable.  Why are you working at Radio Shack?  Because it sounds like you don't like it.  I fucking hate it here. 
[00:12:30]  But you know what?  They pay very well.  Why don't you become a stripper?  I thought about that, actually.  Oh.  What's your measurements?  Thought about it.  36, 26, 35, 36.  Wow-wee.  I'm evenly proportioned.  I'm very, very, very, very Latin-ish, if you know what I mean.  I like that.  You have a nice big hiney?  Yes.  Got a fat dunk-a-dunk.  You got the J-Lo butt working?  You got the J-Lo?  I look better than J-Lo.  You ever date a finished Irish comedian?  We just put out another horrendous movie. 
[00:13:00]  Actually, I only date white boys.  Really?  I meant me, Ope.  Wow.  I thought you were talking about Ben.  What?  No.  Bennifer?  No?  Yeah.  We usually get Ben and Jimmy confused.  Ben Affleck, yes.  Ben Affleck and Jim Norton usually get confused.  He played Daredevil, and I put on tights.  Yeah, well.  So what do you want to do today?  Like I said, you want to do what's in my pants?  I'm sure you guys come up with some more, what's the word, interesting games, so, you know.  At Radio Shack, can you do it with one of their great walkie-talkies? 
[00:13:30]  You want me to do walkie-talkie in my pants?  There you go.  But you're working.  How are we going to pull this off?  And we kind of played the game already.  We don't like to beat bits into the ground, so I'm just going to throw it out there.  Is there anything else you could do for us today?  What do you want me to do?  Give me something to do.  I'm game.  Masturbate.  Masturbate.  She's at the Radio Shack.  Dude, right behind the counter.  Right behind the counter?  Yeah.  I could do that. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Oh, she's so hot.  And while you're doing it, you know, tell us what the people are doing in the store.  There's no one in that crappy store.  What are you kidding?  Is nobody in the store yet?  They know better.  No, no, no.  Here's the question.  While you're doing it, tell us what they're returning.  Well, I'm taking back a $500 scanner.  Yeah, I love how they ask you for too much information they ask you for, too.  No more.  You want to buy frigging batteries.  Name, address, social security number, phone number.  Go screw. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, Raquel, would you ever come into the studio?  I would consider that.  Would you really?  Yes.  How about the wiffle ball bat?  That's what we were talking about or arguing about before.  Oh.  With our phone screener?  Yes, with your phone screener.  Would you be up to doing the wiffle ball bat challenge?  He was saying, he was asking me if I would take one for the team.  I was like, I'd consider it.  Off the air.  Would you give him your, like, information, what store you're at, but off the air?  Yeah, I would do it off the air.  Okay.  Oh.  Jimmy needs to buy something.  No, no, I'm not going to drive to New Brunswick. 
[00:15:00]  Do you have a fella?  What's that?  Do you have a fella?  It's going to be like last summer.  You're going to go to Radio Shack and buy $100 worth of fucking batteries.  That's our initiative now, is the batteries.  All right.  Is there anything you can use around there?  Sell more batteries.  Maybe she can use some batteries.  I love her.  Yeah.  What do you want to use to pleasure yourself?  What can I use to pleasure myself?  There's a plethora of things I could use here.  Cheap organizers that you're trying to sell as a palm pilot. 
[00:15:30]  Take a product off the shelf, do your thing, and then put it back on the shelf.  The executive stress reliever that makes little sound effects when you push the buttons.  What do you got?  The cordless soldering tool.  Well, you don't want to plug that in.  It's cold.  Cold fusion.  All right.  You want to use that on yourself?  Sure.  Yeah.  Give that a try.  She's great.  All right.  Is the doors locked?  Yes. 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  Okay.  We're not open yet.  When do you open?  10?  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock.  All right.  10 o'clock.  All right.  You've got to explain what's going on because this is radio.  It is.  It's XM.  All right.  So you're taking off your jeans or what?  I'm taking off my skirt.  Hey, what's your success rate trying to sell off those stupid guarantees, those year warranties  on items?  I love that.  You buy a piece of crap for 10 bucks over there.  I'm buying it like a cordless phone for like 25 bucks at Radio Shack.  Would you like to buy the year warranty? 
[00:16:30]  Because the one that comes with it really stinks.  So you need to buy this for three years.  If it breaks, I'll throw it through your window and buy another one.  Well, considering that I'm a very, very attractive female, there are very, very, very few men  that say no to me.  Aren't those warranties a bunch of crap?  Jimmy's brilliant.  Stop rubbing your you-know-what.  Oh, look at him.  He's leaning against the console.  And he's rocking back and forth.  Pushing.  You're turning me on very much.  Of course.  Me or her? 
[00:17:00]  What's that, Raquel?  Am I turning you on, Jim?  I have to be honest.  You really are.  Nice.  All right.  So the skirt's off?  Yes.  All right.  What kind of panties are you wearing?  I'm not wearing any.  Oh.  I like that.  Hey, look at that.  The thigh highs.  And you got the wood floor working?  Yes.  Of course you do.  There it is.  Of course.  And you have thigh highs on?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Okay.  And what do you got in your hand?  I've got a very interesting tool in my hand.  What is it?  It is a tool. 
[00:17:30]  It's the soldering thing?  A soldering tool.  All right.  Well, we'll just kind of sit back and-  Rub away.  And listen to Raquel.  And don't forget the grand finale.  You got a shit on a plate.  All right.  Here we go.  That's not happening.  All right.  That's what makes it really funny.  A real hot girl does that after this.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be funny.  And then runs around Radio Shack.  Actually, I've got some porn somewhere on my computer.  If she shit at Radio Shack, she wouldn't be able to tell the difference between that  or the items that are around her for sale. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, could I buy this?  What is it?  God, I pray XM isn't making another deal.  They're not.  Jesus.  They're not.  Actually, they are.  We are in a deal with them, but-  I love Radio Shack.  I do, too.  One of the best stories.  Radio Shack could be the best company ever.  Actually, before Christmas, we shall be selling XM units.  Oh, Jesus.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thank God.  Oh, no.  All right.  So then when you start selling them, we'll talk the store up.  There you go. 
[00:18:30]  I appreciate that.  Okay.  So tell us what's going on.  All right.  Well, right now I'm ever so gently rubbing myself.  And I'm starting to get a little turned on.  I'm starting to get a little turned on.  What are you thinking about?  I'm thinking about watching you, whack bags, jerk yourselves off in front of me.  Oh, I'd love to do that.  Oh, we're doing that now, though.  Sure.  I didn't know you could see that.  All right.  Nice.  Men hanging out in the studio.  Yeah.  Helping each other out. 
[00:19:00]  That would be a circle jerk, huh?  Do you like when a guy does that in front of you?  It's a little arousing, yes.  It's a little arousing.  I'm not a typical female, so, you know.  Okay.  How's it going down there?  Oh, it's going good.  It's going well.  Yeah.  Very well.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  Are you sitting or standing?  Oh, I'm sitting.  With your legs up?  Oh, yeah.  I'm flexible. 
[00:19:30]  Juicy thighs.  I'm flexible.  On those crowded Radio Shack counters.  You don't know where to put your merchandise down while they ring it up?  Because there's so much shit on there.  Because there's just crap all over the counter.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, sorry.  Leaving little dime prints all over the warranties.  Like a bingo marker.  Can I help you with something?  A brown bingo marker.  Oh.  How can I help you?  Oh.  Can I help you?  Oh, can you help me?  Yes, I'd like to return this phone. 
[00:20:00]  It didn't work.  Help me help you.  When I brought it home.  Oh, yeah.  Help me help you.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  Jerry McGuire moment there.  Are you a little damp, if I could ask?  Am I what?  A little bit damp.  I'm a lot damp.  Really?  Can we hear that?  Yeah, exactly.  You want to hear it?  Oh, yeah.  By the phone.  Put the phone down there and kind of.  Okay.  Hold on a second.  It's a little more tricky.  Good.  You know, using one of these crappy cordless phones.  Yeah, good girl. 
[00:20:30]  Hold on a second.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm hearing some.  You hear that?  Yeah, very nice.  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  Huh.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm feeling better about Radio Shack.  I love her.  Hmm.  Oh, yes. 
[00:21:00]  I am definitely a guy's chick.  You're my new chick.  I think I'm in love with you.  All right.  Let's keep going.  Next customer's going to wonder why the receipt smells like trout.  I'm getting there.  I'm getting there.  I want to hand him the change and the bills won't come off her hands.  All right.  Let's keep going.  I just knew.  All right.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh. 
[00:21:30]  Uh-huh.  That's good.  That's good times right there.  Was she on a business call?  Uh-huh.  I've answered the other line.  Radio Shack, can I help you?  There's people commenting how they're rushing to that Radio Shack.  Yeah.  They'll be checking you out in about 20 minutes.  Are we about to get the climax here?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  Uh-huh.  No.  Oh, God.  I'm not feeling it, Ope. 
[00:22:00]  I'm not feeling her, uh, her pleasure.  I do think she's touching herself.  Yeah, but I think it's too many distractions.  I don't think you'll be able to orgasm for real now just because of the distractions, but  I do think that you're touching yourself.  Yeah.  And I do think you have on a little skirt with thigh highs.  I'm very, very sensitive.  It does not take much for me at all.  Do you have a large clitoris or a small one?  I have a large clitoris.  Oh.  All right.  Norton's going to pass out.  Jimmy loves that.  Uh-huh.  The blood just left his head. 
[00:22:30]  I love it.  Does it look like a midget's thumb?  Oh, definitely look like a thumb.  Or Voss's thumb.  Should we give her, like, can you do it in 30 seconds, you think?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Forget it.  I get touched on there and I'm about to come.  All right.  Let's hear it.  You got 30 seconds.  Go ahead.  We'll be quiet.  All right.  Give that thing a workout.  Here we go.  Now.  Go.  God damn it. 
[00:23:00]  Fuck.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I'm good.  Yeah.  I think that's it, right?  Very nice.  Little thigh highs?  Not the best one we've heard, but it definitely does the job.  You're Puerto Rican or Dominican, or what are you?  I'm PR.  Oh, very nice.  I'm PR.  How old are you?  Um, mid-twenties.  Married, kids?  No.  Good, good.  No, no, no.  You got a guy?  Uh, no.  No.  Well, you do now. 
[00:24:00]  Maybe we could go to eat or something and have coffee and get to know each other.  Right, because that's what you freaks do, right, is have coffee.  I do, actually.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  Nice.  He's all about the coffee.  Uh-huh.  If we get along, we get along, but if we don't, we don't.  Raquel, we're going to put you on hold, but before you leave, could you just run around  and yell donkey sausage again, please?  Sure.  Ready one more time?  And actually, you know what?  I will open the doors and let my customers in.  Okay.  There you go.  Okay.  And then I'll run around saying donkey sausage.  I'll do that.  All right.  You got to make it fast here. 
[00:24:30]  Let's go.  It's not all about you.  Let's go.  A lot of people calling tomfoolery.  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of people saying, uh...  It wasn't the best one we've heard.  Yeah.  It was still good.  That's because I'm at a goddamn radio shack.  You want for me.  All right.  Well, you can come in and do the wiffle ball bat next, okay?  Yell donkey sausage.  We got to move on here.  I'm letting people in.  Ready?  Yeah.  Say hi to them.  Doggy sausage.  Doggy sausage.  Doggy sausage.  Why does she say it so weird?  I don't know. 
[00:25:00]  Doggy sausage.  Doggy sausage.  Because it sounds funnier that way.  That's why.  All right, Raquel.  Thank you so much.  Don't hang up.  They're putting you on hold to get your information.  All righty.  Look at Jim.  Always prowling.  All right.  Let me see.  Line six.  We're going to put Raquel on hold for Jimmy.  All right.  Right about here.  John from Philly saying the girl...  Oops.  Oops.  Fall back, Raquel.  Oops.  I don't know what happened.  I'm sorry.  She's going to do the wiffle ball bat.  He couldn't hang up.  I know.  I'm sorry.  John from Philly saying, this chick actually gave me a hard off. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of people saying fake.  She was faking it.  So watch.  She still is hot.  Tell her to choke herself.  Hi.  This is Patty, known as Stalker Patty.  Well, you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's hot.  We have to read this email from the Donkey Sausage Girl.  Oh, here it is.  Donkey Sausage.  Well, we met Donkey Sausage.  She called in from a radio shack, and she said she was really, really hot, and she wanted 
[00:26:00]  to come in for Lesbian for a Day.  Mm-hmm.  And what?  What's up, Ben?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, okay.  I think we were talking about Donkey Sausage Chick.  Oh, yeah.  Donkey Sausage Chick.  So we met her.  She was the radio shack chick that ran around screaming Donkey Sausage, and then she faked  her orgasm.  We got that out of her.  And then she came down to be Lesbian for a Day, and she was dressed up nice for Halloween.  She's a Puerto Rican girl that does an awful Rosie Perez.  She had black angel wings on, and very hot.  I think her pictures are up on foundrymusic.com. 
[00:26:30]  And we had Taylor and Mia from Philly, and I guess we could tell Raquel this now, because  I know she listens every day.  Mm-hmm.  They didn't find her attractive at all.  No.  They did not find her attractive at all, and they pretty much told us behind the scenes  that they would rather not have anything to do with Raquel.  Right.  All right.  Taylor wanted to have fun with Mia, the other blonde.  And that was what they did.  And that's what they did.  And it didn't involve Raquel at all.  So Raquel was sitting in the corner for most of that bit, trying to get attention, because 
[00:27:00]  she was bummed out.  No one was paying attention to her hotness.  And she was hot.  She wasn't as hot as Taylor and Mia, but she was hot.  She had something going on.  I was paying attention to her, and she was blowing me off.  So I was like, that was that?  Oh, you got really pissed off, because she dissed you.  I believe Jim called her what?  What was the word you used?  Oh, cocktease?  Yes, cocktease is the word.  All right.  Why would she use cocktease?  Anyone, any girl that talks to Jim, even says hello on the street, and doesn't have sex 
[00:27:30]  with him is a cocktease.  That's what I've noticed.  Raquel is included.  No, but I'll say.  Wait, how many emails did she?  No, no, here's what it is.  This is one she sent to me, which I forgot she sent to me.  And then I'm reading this.  It says, I wrote you an email.  You could tell him he could share it with you.  And I'm like, I think I still have it saved.  So I'm like, oh, yeah.  And I just printed it out.  I don't know if it's of any value or not.  Which one is first?  She sent me this one, but I don't know which one she...  Oh, she must have sent me the one first.  Let me see.  Wait, there's...  11-1.  10-29 she sent.  Suck you so bad.  10-29.  How many emails is she going to send?  One to me, one to Steve. 
[00:28:00]  All right, which one should we read?  The one to you?  No, whichever one you want.  I don't know which one's better.  I just printed it out to have it.  I know, but now you confused the issue.  Oh, okay.  I didn't mean to.  Because I read this one.  It was pretty good.  Let's read this one.  Anthony?  What?  All right, we'll read the one.  I'm screening this one really quick, scanning it, and it looks pretty good, too.  She's out of her mind, is what she is.  All right, here we go.  So, Raquel, I'm not going to use her real name, although I would love to at this point,  and she wrote Jimmy after the show, after her appearance on the show, right? 
[00:28:30]  Mm-hmm.  She writes, sorry, sorry, sorry.  I feel like such a huge failure.  I totally froze up.  Dude, I'm effing whacked.  I could have done nine inches on that sorry excuse for a wiffle ball bat.  Yeah, could have, should have, would have.  That's all I'm hearing from her.  That's all.  Dude, there was another end of the bat.  She never even suggested that.  We'd have gone out and brought you a brand new bat if you didn't want to use one that she...  And that would have been great competition.  All of a sudden, Taylor takes six and three quarters, or whatever the official measurement was, 
[00:29:00]  and then Raquel steps up to the plate and say, I could do better?  Well, Raquel wouldn't get naked.  Right.  Yeah, so...  She was all talk.  All talk, no action.  Yeah, for future sluts that are going to come on our show, if you're all talk, no action, stay home, please.  Yeah.  This is the real deal now with Satellite Radio.  We can't waste our time with girls that say that they're going to do all sorts of crazy stuff,  and then come in and don't do anything.  Please don't waste our time.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm so angry with myself and kicking myself for ever mentioning that I work for Radio Shack. 
[00:29:30]  If I hadn't said that, I would have raped that sorry excuse for a lesbian, Taylor, with her snotty attitude.  Oh, boy.  She's got a problem with the porn star, Taylor.  That sorry excuse for a lesbian.  I've never seen better lesbianism in my life than what was going on here.  That was great stuff.  Got to agree.  Great stuff.  And Taylor is really hot.  I'll say.  They licked.  They sucked.  They put stuff in.  You can't lose.  I haven't whacked my bag, and this is honest to God's truth, to anybody alive as much as I've whacked my bag to Taylor in the last three years. 
[00:30:00]  Hey, there you go.  A ringing endorsement.  That's a great endorsement.  She's got a new DVD out, too.  Yes, Erotic Film Girls.  I think it's linked to Foundry Music.  Yes, Steve's nodding his head.  Foundrymusic.com.  You're a smut source.  I don't know about you, but when people give off negative energy or look at you like you're a worthless, dirty spick,  you kind of get discouraged from wanting to make out with them.  Oh, boy.  See, this is a little bit of a self-hating thing going on here.  See, but I said earlier, I mean, Raquel is definitely a good-looking girl.  Oh, yeah.  She's definitely hot. 
[00:30:30]  But there was no chemistry.  Taylor didn't want anything to do with her.  Nope.  That's all.  That's what you were seeing.  She was petrified.  She's like, no.  And I'll tell you what.  Because she has morals as well.  What?  I'll tell you what.  Morals?  What?  I'll tell you what you're missing.  Who has morals?  This is what you're missing.  Taylor's a porn star.  It's what she does.  It's what she's done.  And porn stars, despite what people say about them, are age-paranoid.  Right.  So they don't want to mess around unless you have a test.  You have to have a test that is recent.  So a lot of them are probably more likely to make out with another girl they know.  Of course. 
[00:31:00]  Who they know is clean.  That's all that's about.  Okay.  So you kind of get discouraged from wanting to make out with them.  Okay.  If you're interested, this is what happened before we entered.  Skip over if you don't feel like bothering.  Steve walks over to the ugly versions of Jessica and Ashley Simpson.  Now, she's calling the two fine young lesbians we had in here the ugly versions of Jessica  and Ashley Simpson.  Wow.  Point over to me and says that I'm the leszy version that needs to be broken in. 
[00:31:30]  The chick's hubby, or whoever he was, says to myself and the other ladies that since I  was dressed up in Dom gear, that I should either use the drill dough on them or F them  with a strap on.  Shit.  I got wet just thinking about it.  I was all game then.  I see this look, not sure if it was before or after Steve mentioned that I was a fiery  Latina vixen or that her man got wood from taking multiple pics of me.  Whatever the case was, she said no, that she only wanted her ugly bitch friend to play.  And I have to say, I was disappointed and felt like a complete tool just watching and 
[00:32:00]  not doing anything.  Mia was not ugly.  No.  This is almost sociopathic in its lack of ability to analyze what happened.  Right, right.  There's a complete lack of any understanding as to what was happening in the studio, the  whole vibe that was going on.  Hinkley had a better grasp on his Jodie Foster relationship.  And she does with what was happening between her and those girls and the girls with each  other.  The guy who takes pictures of Taylor was not jealous. 
[00:32:30]  And Taylor was not jealous.  It just doesn't make sense.  For being a porn star, she fucking sucked.  What kind of filthy whore turns out a nice, clean girl like me?  How is she supposed to know you don't have the hiv?  Absolutely.  Especially after she saw you and I talking.  Right.  Could have been freshly given to you.  Anyhow, sorry about ranting.  You might have it, by the way, just from talking to Jim.  Anyhow, sorry about ranting, but I figured that you would understand.  You forgot to put in the, you didn't read what was in parentheses.  Oh, that's an important one. 
[00:33:00]  Cleanliness is next to godliness.  That's what she writes.  Five exclamation points.  Five exclamation points.  That's right.  Important, important information when inserting a wiffle ball back.  Anyhow, sorry about ranting, but I figured that you would understand that I don't think  O and A were prepared for a girl like me.  Oh, okay.  Now, hold on right now.  Slow down.  You could slow down right there.  You have this way inflated image of yourself, first of all.  Aren't ready for a girl like you?  Do you know the types of fucking lunatics we've had to deal with in the studio over the  past ten years that me and Opie have been doing this program? 
[00:33:30]  Ten years.  You're not even a fly on the wall over some of the nutcase, slutbag bitches we've had in  the studio.  I had a girl wrapped up in Christmas lights punch me in the face.  I got in a fight with a girl that was in the studio doing poetry, and when I commented on  her poetry, she leaned over and punched me in the face and started kicking my ass, and  she was nude, nothing but Christmas lights on her body. 
[00:34:00]  And that's one of the girls I really had to dredge up out of my memory.  There's others, honey.  Believe me, not ready for a girl like you?  You were one of the dime a dozen girls that passed through here with this overinflated  image of what you did for the show.  You did nothing.  And as a matter of fact, it's kind of a tribute to maybe that you were kind of good looking,  the fact that we didn't throw your ass out of you for talking on the mic every two fucking  seconds.  I was reading the instant feedback.  I saw the phone calls.  They didn't like you. 
[00:34:30]  The audience did not like you.  You were commenting and talking over people's jokes.  You were adding nothing to the program, and if you wanted to step up, how about instead  of commenting how you wanted to give the girl the drill, though, how about you take  it?  You didn't want to do anything.  Wow.  Good rant, Anthony.  I forgot about the poetry girl.  She beat me up.  I know she did.  It was great.  There were so many of those.  It was great radio.  Not ready for that.  The girl leaned over.  I lit a bottle rocket, and it flew out of her cunt. 
[00:35:00]  How the hell did you get...  What did you do?  We're not ready for you.  We're not ready for you?  We built a shield so a girl wouldn't get her pussy burned.  Well, use the snatch as a rocket launcher.  Right.  Now, that's a memorable girl that we were maybe not ready for, Opie.  Right.  What about the girl that could throw eggs from her vag?  A girl was throwing eggs at a blind guy out of her vagina.  Not using her hands, but we're not ready for you.  That I can say maybe I wasn't ready to see.  You sprayed a girl with pig's blood. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  Pig's blood.  We loaded up super soakers, two of them, with pig blood, swine blood.  Stripped her naked and sprayed her down until she looked like the end of Carrie.  Part of the 55-gallon drum challenge, we had to get a stretcher up to the 10th floor, and  they had to take the girl out on a stretcher completely nude and filled with, you know,  covered with filth.  Because a live cricket had crawled into her ear and couldn't get out.  You remember that chick, Cinder Moon, that sat on top of the big Tesla coil, ran all those 
[00:36:00]  volts of electricity through her body?  There you go.  And then you guys ragged on her because it wasn't impressive enough, and she broke down  crying in the bathroom?  Right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Raquel, we're not ready for you.  Are you kidding me?  We're not ready for you?  If we weren't ready for you, how would we possibly be ready for a girl that took a cell phone  up her vagina and we called it to see if we could get a signal in her womb?  Now, that's something maybe I wasn't ready to see.  Montana Gunn had an ice cube in her asshole, and it popped out in my hand, and I threw it 
[00:36:30]  in my mouth.  Right.  You wouldn't even rub your knuckles on my mule.  And, uh, let's see.  Wait, she's O and A weren't prepared for a girl like me.  Exclamation point.  Raquel.  What's up?  What's up?  Are you insane writing these emails?  You're a crazy person.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Before I even go on, how long have I been listening to the show?  For a very long time.  Do I know exactly what to say to get you guys worked up and have plenty of shit to fucking  argue about?  Absolutely. 
[00:37:00]  So, I don't mind you ragging on me.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I am fucking nuts.  I'm crazy.  Not crazy.  Here's the problem, because I like you, but you're coming off as arrogant, and that's  the problem.  So, you're not coming off going, hey, I froze up a little bit.  That's not a big deal if you freeze up.  It happens.  No big deal.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did choke up.  But you're coming off acting like O and A couldn't handle you, and that's...  No, no, I didn't mean it like that.  I just meant that, you know...  I was being polite.  There was a time I made a hardcore dominatrix run out of the studio crying.  We can't handle you? 
[00:37:30]  What do you mean by, I don't think O and A were prepared for a girl like me?  I know you're a very bright girl, right?  I'm very talkative.  I'm very talkative.  All women are.  We've had that.  Did you just hear that mutant lady die?  She's a little talkative.  If I wanted to talk, I'd go home.  We don't need girls talking in this studio.  We need girls doing what every guy wants them to do.  Have lesbian experiences.  This is our fantasy world right here.  We don't need girls talking.  That's the last thing we need.  How many girls do you hear talking on this show, telling us some interesting point about 
[00:38:00]  a subject?  Not often.  Not often.  So we should read the rest of the email.  I say absolutely we should read the rest of the email.  This is actually the one you wrote to me.  I'm a very tough bitch.  I am far from shy.  And honestly, I would have grabbed your mule talking about Jim Norton in front of everyone  if it weren't for the fear of Opie saying, ooh, the Radio Shack girl is grabbing Jimmy's  Nob, what would be the problem if I yelled that out if you were grabbing his mule? 
[00:38:30]  Because there's a lot of people listening.  And I didn't care that you didn't anyway.  Oh, so you weren't here for that.  That's fine.  She didn't want her boyfriend knowing that she's cheating on him.  But she actually didn't grab it.  That wasn't what you were here for.  That was killing me.  I actually am stepping down from the big store I have now to the one I got promoted from  so I can have more time to myself.  But blabbing my mouth off on O&A was certainly a good start.  Laugh.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  Chuckle, chuckle.  Other than the stupid fake Lesleys, I had a great time.  Lesleys?  Wait a minute.  What was fake about the lesbians? 
[00:39:00]  Okay, all right, all right.  How was that fake Lesley?  They ate each other's pussies.  No, I know, I know, I know.  Listen, this was my thing with them, all right?  Like, they kept on giving, okay, I understand that they're porn stars, so yeah, they don't  want to play around with girls that they don't know that are tested, blah, blah, blah,  whatever.  But there was no need for the dirty looks.  There were no need for that.  So, you know, I get over angry.  They didn't like you.  That's fine.  So, they didn't have to give me dirty looks?  I was more than polite to them.  They just didn't like you, and I didn't want to bring that up on the air, because, you  know, we didn't know you, so I'm like, whatever. 
[00:39:30]  This is the new kind Leropey.  I didn't want to, like, you know, put you in a bad spot.  Kinder.  Kinder.  I've always been kind.  All right, so other than the stupid fake Lesleys, I had a great time.  It was an absolute pleasure meeting you and think that you and I could corrupt a few  more innocent people out there.  You are effing cool, and I would be honored to be able to hang with you sometime.  You said you live or are from Jersey, right?  I'm semi-hosting a stripper Halloween party with myself as a star. 
[00:40:00]  Of course, you as a star.  And I'm recruiting a few young whores to play as well.  Don't know how you feel about hanging out with strangers, but you are more than welcome  to join the fun, and maybe we could F with a few people's heads and cause them some serious  mental anguish or a serious complex.  Did you show up, Jimmy?  No, I couldn't, because I don't like head games.  Feel free to give me a call, and forgive me if it sounds like I'm bitching, because I'm  not that flowery of a chick.  Again, it was awesome finally meeting some decent people, you and the guys, that is, and  anytime you guys are up to some shenanigans and you want a hot chick to take part, count 
[00:40:30]  me in.  Oh, what?  You got hot friends?  Yeah.  I do.  Count me in.  I was thinking maybe I could round up a bunch of my hot friends and we could do an amateur  stripper contest, giving you lap dancers and you picking the winner.  You know, good old American fun.  Talk to you soon.  Real name.  P.S.  I'm so sorry.  Tell the guys I said sorry, too.  I'm a lot more fun than that.  I really want to F a girl.  I don't know, man. 
[00:41:00]  I think you're all talk.  Sure.  You know.  Yeah.  Why?  Oh, yeah.  You did like us, though, right?  I did.  I think you guys are great.  Then why were you calling them assholes when you were walking out of the building?  Oh, who is this now?  Our intern.  What's his name?  What's your name?  I'm Derek.  Hi, Derek.  Oh, that's Derek.  I know all the interns' names.  That's Derek.  Is this your first date?  No.  Oh, no.  He's been doing a great job running the board.  Oh.  Wait, what was I calling you guys assholes?  Because you guys are.  According to Derek, our intern, you were like bad-mouthing us after the show. 
[00:41:30]  No, no, no.  Not bad-mouthing you.  I said you guys are assholes.  Everybody's an asshole.  I'm an asshole.  Oh, boy.  Typical manner of the show.  Stop whining.  On Ray.  This fucking pig.  Oh, my God.  You guys give this pig a chance to come on the air.  Oh, shut up.  Listen to me, you little slut.  You're like you call the show.  Okay, listen.  You little typical Latina.  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable with this girl.  You give her the chance to come on the air. 
[00:42:00]  The porn stars think she's a pig.  Because she is a pig.  I saw the pictures.  Nothing special.  You work at a radio shack.  You may as well work at a fucking A&P.  You're a worthless pig.  On Ray.  You'll be stocking milk.  Work at a radio shack.  Come on the air.  These guys give you a chance.  And you do nothing but complain.  Because people don't find you attractive.  Because you are not.  All right, On Ray.  You won't.  On Ray made her hang up.  Yeah, she hung up, man.  Well, she should hang up. 
[00:42:30]  Because she's a pig.  Unbelievable.  You actually give her the chance.  And she complains.  Okay?  So that's all.  I have nothing more to say.  I'm the new Frenchie.  Goodbye.  All right.  Yeah.  And another stellar phone call for the new Frenchie.  Raquel should have hung up, though.  Because in one breath, you're saying, like, they're not ready for a girl like you.  Because you're very, like, ballsy and talkative.  Well, there was a chance.  A guy's caught up to give you a trashing.  No one was going to cut you off, Raquel.  You could have trashed him back.  Turned around and bashed him right back.  Showed some of the balls that she says she has.  Bashed him in his pseudo-French face.  We deliver keggers. 
[00:43:00]  Yep.  What's that, Ope?  I don't know what that means.  Now, there's a second email.  But over the phone, I want to get back to the cell phone call.  She was saying that we're assholes?  Yeah, she was walking behind me as I was leaving the building.  And she was, I guess, calling her boyfriend.  And she was like, God, those guys are such assholes.  I can't believe it.  And it wasn't in a fun way.  Like, I would sit there and say, oh, Jimmy, I love when he goofs on that.  He's such an asshole.  You know, that's kind of a fun.  But, Ant, why would you?  Well, because you're an asshole.  No, she was being serious about it. 
[00:43:30]  And then she sort of stormed off down the block when she walked out of the building.  Yeah, so it was more of a serious, we're assholes.  Yeah.  Because we didn't sign her to a contract to be on our show, which I think she expected us to do.  Or she comes off in these emails like somebody that thinks a lot more of herself than she's presenting to other people.  Well, who did she send this one to, Steve?  I believe the second one was to Steve and his big C.  All right.  So he wrote, she wrote, Steve, after writing Jimmy. 
[00:44:00]  I wrote Jim an email about Friday.  Can you tell him I said he could share it with you?  But I felt like I did badly because of the whole fake porn stars and all.  They weren't fake porn stars.  I love that.  Yeah, fake lesbian, fake porn star.  The one girl's thighs were shaking like jello.  She was so into it.  They're not fake.  If you didn't get along with them on a personality level.  That's one thing.  But I got stalactite on my ceiling that says that Taylor is not a fake porn star.  Having a big mule in your mouth and going, uh-oh, I'd be gay if I wasn't faking this. 
[00:44:30]  How fake is it when it's happening right in front of your face?  They weren't fake porn stars.  Now you're pissing us off.  What was fake about them?  Did you say her taste?  No, no, no.  They went at it.  Absolutely, absolutely.  So what are you talking about fake porn stars?  They took six and three quarters of the bat.  You wrote it.  Fake porn stars and all.  They both had orgasms.  Okay.  What did you mean by fake?  What's fake about them?  They got, uh, they, uh, the one, because the one is, uh, in porn and the other is just 
[00:45:00]  her friend, has DVDs out.  I think, I think Mia was a lot more attractive than Taylor.  There was just something about Taylor's mouth that was just really unattractive.  You ever watch, let me play Devil's Advocate.  You ever watch her give her a hummer?  You ever watch her give her a hummer?  Her mouth, her mouth is a thing of art.  I break down and I get emotional when I think of her mouth.  I have a question.  Do you have a computer in front of you?  Uh, yeah.  Do you have a copy of the email you sent? 
[00:45:30]  Um, probably yes.  Could you bring it up real quick?  Because if we're reading it, why don't you read it?  I mean, I'm just guessing that it would be better to have you read it.  Well, because I'm, I'm sitting.  Yeah, you can read it as Rosie Perez.  Jesus.  Quiet.  That's what this show needs.  Listeners doing impressions.  Awful.  That's great.  Wait, do you have a, can you, can you bring this up and read it under scent mail?  I'd rather not.  Could you argue back at us as Rosie Perez?  Because she's a, she's a tough Latino chick. 
[00:46:00]  No, she's not.  They're all soft.  Come on.  Could you at least yell bubbles and then throw your tool, your, uh, I can't remember the word.  I suck.  What is it that she did in that movie?  If I knew what the hell you were talking about.  You know, just the fact that I asked that.  Not enough info.  I should be drummed out of fucking radio.  What is it that she did in that movie?  Fat titted little non-recall nothing.  All right, here we go.  Let's get through this letter that she wrote to Steve.  I had a really hard time holding back my frustrations with them.  The dirty looks I got from them and the cold shoulder treatment.  Not to mention that they were effing ugly bitches to begin with. 
[00:46:30]  The fact that they had the audacity.  I wasn't attracted to them.  I wasn't attracted to them.  The fact that they had the audacity to give me a dirty look made me want to pimp slap  the white off them professional hoes.  They were by far the lamest lesbians I'd ever seen.  Lame lesbians.  And now, why was that lame?  You haven't answered this.  Why do you think that lesbianism was lame?  I don't know.  I just wasn't turned on by it.  I mean, I was kind of, uh, you know, shocked that they were.  Andre.  Why did you hang up on me? 
[00:47:00]  Why?  Because you're a figure.  I asked you why.  What?  Because I didn't feel like listening to you wrench and rave and pretend like you're somebody  else and, you know.  Pretend that I'm somebody else.  You know, because you know I tell the truth.  That's why you hang up on me.  I just hang up on you.  That's why.  Because I tell the truth and I say it and you know it.  Hey, don't those have problems, too.  And you have nothing to say.  Don't those have problems, too.  You have no defense.  Oh, poor guy who has to be with her.  Terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  No, that's why most guys can't.  Must try to kill himself nightly.  Does he have a rope hanging from his ceiling?  Does he have a rope hanging from his ceiling at all? 
[00:47:30]  No, actually.  Does he have that or, you know, what?  Does he stand in front of traffic every day when you talk?  Absolutely.  Do you talk like Rosie Perez in bed, too?  Is that how you do it?  No, not so much.  Not so much.  Do you think he could vomit in the bed?  You two try to make, oh, terrible love, peak love.  Oof.  Yeah, Raquel, why don't you yell back at him as Rosie?  Yeah, let's hear that good impression again.  Come on.  I want to hear it.  No, not quite.  Okay.  Right.  Have nothing left.  You going to hang up again?  No, because I have nothing to say to you, because you're a worthless piece of shit with a fucked 
[00:48:00]  up accent.  You can't speak straight.  Okay.  Is it fucked up as a Rosie Perez impression, too?  Worse.  Worse than the Rosie Perez impression.  No classic.  Okay.  I'm going to go look at your ugly pictures again online, you picked.  Oh, go for it.  Go for it.  That's great.  There goes the new Frenchie.  Jeez.  The new Frenchie.  I like the new Frenchie.  He knows when to punch out.  Yeah, he punches out.  He really is like a sniper.  All right, so you want to slap the white off them professional hoes.  They were by far the lamest lesbians I'd ever seen.  I was biting my tongue not to say anything about their lame performances, especially with 
[00:48:30]  the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Six inches.  I thought that was lame.  I'm sorry.  You know what?  When you guys said wiffle ball bat challenge, I was expecting one of those old wiffle ball  bats that are fucking like seven or inches round.  We don't want to have a little fun.  We don't want to kill the girl.  And that's the wiffle ball bat.  It's not the wooden leg challenge.  There is no way you would top that mark.  That's the wiffle ball bat that we all grew up using.  What bat are you talking about?  The bat that hit you over the head when you were a kid? 
[00:49:00]  No, no, no.  Not the big monstrous one.  But then, you know, the regular bat.  It's like a regular bat, but it's yellow and plastic.  So, Raquel, just out of curiosity, why didn't you do it?  I mean, it would have been cool if you did it.  There was condoms on the bat, so you wouldn't have had...  I know.  Especially the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Six inches.  That's crap.  I could deep throat more than that.  Yes, I most definitely could.  You're all talk, no action.  I can't do anything.  Why?  Why can't you do anything?  Because, like I said, my job.  Then why...  Then...  Then this is why we didn't get you involved in the action. 
[00:49:30]  Because we knew you weren't going to do anything.  But you had to keep on mentioning where I was coming from.  If only I had not mentioned the Radio Shack thing from the get-go,  and people were not watching me,  that show would have gone in a much different direction.  Really?  Really?  It would have...  Matter of fact, listen...  People are saying it was the best show we've ever done.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  But you were going to make that...  How were you going to make that show that we all listened to Friday better?  I really need to hear this.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  I said it would have went in a different direction.  I never said it would have been better. 
[00:50:00]  I said it would have went in a different direction.  That show was great.  Valde was great.  The other stuff that happened was great.  I didn't knock that at all.  You guys were fucking fantastic.  Like, you guys always are.  So I'm not negating that at all.  I was all game on using the drill though on either one of them.  Pussies.  I was.  Definitely.  Why didn't you take the drill though?  Because!  I also had no chance to get them to warm up to me.  As I was telling Jim, when it comes to my body and physical attributes, I'm pretty shy and humble.  I really don't think that I'm all that. 
[00:50:30]  I really just said that in the beginning so you guys would want to meet me.  But when it comes to getting what I want, getting people to do what I want, I own that.  In big letters.  I was telling Norton that I would love to come back and maybe help out once in a while.  I think I could be of good use to the boys.  I can get girls to do whatever I want and get girls to do whatever I want and men forget it.  I don't have to ask.  Let me tell you something.  We don't want women as part of our daily radio show.  Women on radio stink.  Absolutely stink. 
[00:51:00]  All right?  Robin works for Howard.  She does nothing for that radio show.  Absolutely nothing.  Oh, stop.  She was hired back in the day when you couldn't be so racist and speak your mind.  So Howard figured I'd get a black chick so I could do some black jokes and no one will yell and scream.  That's the only reason she's on that fucking show.  I needed a shwoogie.  He needed a shwoogie and a laugh track.  That's it.  That's what girls are good for when it comes to radio. 
[00:51:30]  Women on radio stink.  They're awful.  Name me one woman that did great on radio that wasn't doing a sex show.  Marion?  Oh, Marion.  You know, by the way, she just got an XM satellite radio, Marion.  I know.  I saw some people from the Post searching outside.  I simply based it on my unbelievable skills of being a hustler, being reekin' and all.  It comes natural.  I'm convincing when I want to be.  I'm persuasive, aggressive, manipulative, charming, and occasionally I use my sex appeal. 
[00:52:00]  Raquel, Raquel.  You really want to be a part of this radio show.  I don't want to cut it off.  No, really.  Yes, sir.  I just want to...  Raquel, Raquel.  Hold on.  Jimmy's speaking.  Hold on, Raquel.  I just want to...  There's just a bit of a conflict here.  One sentence, I'm pretty shy and humble, and then three sentences down, I'm persuasive,  aggressive, manipulative, charming, and occasionally I use sex appeal.  That's a sociopathic...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sociopathic.  So I'm sociopathic.  I'm just saying it is a bit inconsistent. 
[00:52:30]  You have to admit.  All right, let me finish this up here.  I simply based it on...  Okay, we got that.  I used my sex appeal.  Bottom line is, I know what it takes to get shit done.  Whether it's calming teen girls to do whatever you want to convince...  To convincing cops, hire authorities, anyone to do as you please.  Trust me, I'm that good.  I should have been fired from the Radio Shack two years ago, let alone a week ago, but I'm  still here.  You want a position on this radio show.  We're not hiring.  So if I was bad on Friday, it's with reason, nerves, stupid bitches with no play and big 
[00:53:00]  attitudes, and I was a little intimidated by the boys, O&A.  But now I'm game.  And again, it was a great pleasure meeting you, Steve.  You are cool as hell, and it's great that you are the one running things.  I wonder who said that on the phone.  I did not.  I did not.  I don't know.  I think Steve re-typed this email.  He'll make himself look good.  He's running things?  Yeah.  I did not.  Holy crap, he's walking around here with a fucking martini.  Steve, who should I talk to?  Well, technically, Ben is the producer, but I'm more than willing to step up into his position. 
[00:53:30]  It's really irritating when you do that.  Because I know Ben has been watching the Boston Red Sox for the last two weeks, so I'm the  boss now.  Ben comes in drunk and tired.  And Steve wants your job, Ben.  Oh, my.  Holy.  You're delusional if you think Steve's running this show.  Yeah, thank you.  I, for the record, never, never said that.  Oh, my God.  Listen, listen, listen, listen, wait.  It's great that you're the one running.  Shut up.  Hold on.  Oh, Steve, is it cool to move on?  Yeah, Steve, do you think we...  Can we move on?  Can I go?  I've got to go back to work. 
[00:54:00]  Steve, please do.  Hold on, hold on.  No, no, don't go.  Hold on.  We're going to give you...  Martini, Steve.  We're going to give you a chance here.  All right, really fast.  Okay, so Steve's running things.  I'd love to flood you with some great kinky-ass ideas that the guys would find historical.  Please send those ideas to Steve, and I will read them on the air with an open mind and  see if you actually have what it takes.  So whenever you are in need of a chick with an imaginary dick...  What?  Why?  There's plenty of chicks with real ones.  Give me a call.  Thanks again, Steve.  You signed your real name. 
[00:54:30]  I'll save that.  P.S.  Sorry to chew your ear off.  That's what attractive, intelligent women do.  Don't forget, shy and humble.  Well, Raquel, I think it's time.  I think it's time to just walk away.  Yeah.  The clock says...  I do.  I've got to walk away.  I've got to walk away.  The clock says 15 minutes.  It was nice.  Listen, all I wanted is to give you plenty of material to fuck with.  So, hey...  It was a good bit.  That was great.  It was a good bit.  The whole donkey sausage thing, you know?  Yeah.  Oh.  And there she goes. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, and there she goes.  We lose another one, Anthony.  Thank God.  She's one of these girls that, I don't know, has this image of themselves, and it's nothing  like they really are.  She sees herself as this tough, hot Latina chick that's going to come in here and woo all  of us, have us, hold us all in the palm of her hand, Opie, be able to work us, and  actually work and maybe even get a spot here on the show. 
[00:55:30]  Yes.  Work us like a puppet on a string.  Another pessimism.  Another pessimism, aren't they?  We didn't have enough time, Raquel.  It just wasn't enough time.  But she's got this image of herself, and it just isn't anything like real life.  It didn't work out.  Now she's portraying the letters that she sent as some kind of ploy to give us material.  Like, look how I helped you out.  Like, you know, like she spent her time thinking this up so we would have this break today. 
[00:56:00]  No, I'm not buying that.  Maybe I could put a bat in my vagina.  You're out, Raquel.  She's hot.  You know.  She's very hot.  She's definitely hot.  Opie, can I run around and yell donkey sausage for old time's sake?  Sorry, Raquel.  Can't do it, Raquel.  Just walk away.  Your customers are waiting.  Go out to the car.  We'll drive you back to the Radio Shack.  The line forms here. 
[00:56:30]  Take the gun.  Leave the shitty electronic product.  All right.  All right.  She likes saying a Hail Mary before she shoves a bat in there.  We're not getting into everything today, huh?  Do we have more Halloween audio, or are we going to have to wait until tomorrow?  Wait until tomorrow.  All right, we'll wait for you, Mom.  Raquel's back on the phone.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  I got no one else to go!  Oh.  I got no one else to go! 
[00:57:00]  Really?  Yes?  Anything else?  I got ducted.  Yes?  I got ducted.  Yeah.  Of course.  Sorry.  Oof.  All right.  Our first sociopath.  I feel bad things worked out that way.  It's about time, man.  Our first lunatic of the new show.  Only took a month.  Okay.  Yeah, we're going to break, and we got Tom Brokaw audio and other things to get to.  Yes, we do.  And I don't know.  And that's that.  Ben?  I'm just coming in the studio. 
[00:57:30]  Huh?  I'm just coming in the studio.  Oh.  No, I know.  I know.  I just think it's funny that Steve is trying to, you know.  I want to ask producer Steve.  What?  I never, ever said that.  Yeah.  Multinisting.  Look at Gravano trying to take over for Gotti.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  There's going to be a shootout.  No.  In the production room later.  On the Opie and Anthony show, we're going to make fun of people with Down syndrome. 
[00:58:00]  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle  hoping candy comes out and blow the door off the planet.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  The Opie and Anthony show.

For a while, the TV network said that people who skipped commercials using digital video recorders like the TiVo were thieves.  Meanwhile, people who shell out $50 to $100 a month for cable didn't appreciate the accusation.  The networks are finally coming to terms with the fact that people are consuming entertainment in a different way now. 
[01:00:30]  Several shows are available for purchase online at the Apple iTunes store for $2.  And the old model of television, where it was free and there were commercials in between, is coming back online.  ABC has announced they'll be putting shows online that have commercials included.  Anyone can download and watch the shows for free.  ABC will have an exact count of how many people downloaded and watched the show, and then they can sell advertising.  Programs such as Lost, Grey's Anatomy, and Desperate Housewives will be available for free online. 
[01:01:00]  If the experiment works, you can expect to see other networks follow suit.  I'm LAZLOW.com.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or XM-CANADA at 877-438-9677.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off? It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Tell the law was lesbian for a day on Friday with her friend Mia. 
[01:01:30]  Did a great job for us.  A lot of people say in Friday's show was the best show we've done so far on XM Saturday Radio.  Had a lot of fun, Anthony.  Yeah.  She took the wiffle ball bat like a champ.  Did about six and three-quarter inches, I do believe.  And, man, everyone feeling really good about the show and ourselves.  Yeah.  And then Raquel called us yesterday and sent email to people and members of the show.  And she was a real buzzkill, the donkey sausage chick from Radio Shack.  And she trashed Taylor and Mia, saying they were like fake lesbians and they weren't that hot. 
[01:02:00]  And she was insulted that she couldn't get in there.  Yeah.  And, you know, she was just, I don't know, she was just being a baby, basically.  And she trashed Taylor pretty good.  So we want to say hi to Taylor.  Taylor.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Hi, Taylor.  It's Tony Dance.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  I heard she was seriously talking some shit yesterday about us.  Yes, using things like calling you two fake lesbians, fake porn star. 
[01:02:30]  Not that hot.  Not hot.  She actually...  Bad implants.  I think she was blind because she actually said you were ugly.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I was going to try to take the high road and just say that I prefer only  working with blondes or girls that I know.  But you know what?  I prefer working with girls that don't have tires for stomachs.  Her ass, like, even if I went to go to lick her pussy, I don't even think I'd be able to  find it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, didn't like her ass at all, huh? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, Raquel had the nice face working, but it got worse and worse as you moved your eyes  downward, I do believe.  Yes.  Yes.  Saggy tits and the stomach was just atrocious, and I just don't understand how she could say  that was fake.  Did she not see my tongue in Mia's pussy?  Yeah, I know.  It wasn't fake.  It was happening right there in front of everybody.  I saw everyone's thighs shaking like Jell-O.  Yeah.  That was the real deal.  And as far as saggy tits and an atrocious stomach, I want to know, what do I have to  do with this? 
[01:03:30]  You hush, you.  You're a cutie.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  A little love connection?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at you.  All right.  Wow.  So you're saying the reason you...  You just weren't attracted to her at all.  Yeah, you weren't attracted to her.  You pretty much told people behind the scenes, I will do nothing with her.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  I mean, I was told as long as she's hot, then fine, and I didn't have a problem with  that.  When I walked in, me and I both took a look at her, and we were like, there's no way  and how we're touching this chick. 
[01:04:00]  So.  There you have it.  Hmm.  All right.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  Brutally honest.  I'm kind of stalling because I'm hoping that Raquel would call in the show and we could  have a fine cat fight, Anthony.  Hmm.  Oh, we got Raquel?  Oh.  We got Raquel?  All right.  Yeah, let's finally end this.  Raquel.  Yes.  Have you been listening to the show today?  Obviously.  Not really.  All right.  Well, I got Taylor on the phone.  We really got to put an end to this.  Taylor.  Yeah.  Okay, Raquel is on the line. 
[01:04:30]  She hasn't been listening to the show today, so could you repeat what you told us?  Sure.  All right.  Go ahead.  Raquel, when I walked in, I was told that you were going to be hot.  So when we walked in, me and I looked at each other.  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that I'm not blonde, blue eyes, and you know.  Well, I'm sorry, too.  It doesn't happen that way all the time.  Listen.  Plain and simple.  Plain and simple.  I wasn't attracted to you.  I wasn't attracted to your friend.  I really don't care. 
[01:05:00]  It's done and over with.  I'm a husband.  You're a husband.  I don't care.  I'm done.  All right?  Thanks for everything.  The guys were great.  Everything was fun.  Blah, blah, blah.  Goodbye.  Ooh.  Wow.  That wasn't much of a fight.  Oh, yeah.  Of course you did.  She's a psycho broad.  Is that it?  We should have had her say, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  If she...  Why did she start all this shit then?  If she was done and she wasn't attracted to me or me.  We gave that some serious thought and we came to the conclusion she's a lunatic. 
[01:05:30]  And she wants to be part of the Opie and Anthony program.  And we don't hire women.  We just don't.  They ruin everything.  No, they don't.  We want our women to live in our fantasy world.  And Raquel thinks she could bring some intelligence to this program and we're just not interested.  Well, she can bring fat to the program.  And that's for sure.  Oh.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow. 
[01:06:00]  Meow.  All right.  Love it.  All right.  Thank you, Taylor.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  She's calling back.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Raquel.  What's up?  We don't want you going away, man.  Just go away.  Yeah, why do you keep hanging up?  I mean, no one's trashy.  Listen, you know what?  You're not a bad looking girl, so why are you taking this from Taylor?  Taylor.  I read on air there.  Taylor. 
[01:06:30]  It's Taylor law.  It's contagious.  All right.  Raquel.  You want me to see your mom's box?  No, just calm down.  Taylor thinks you're a little chubby around the midsection.  Hey.  And she thinks your boobs.  I used to be a lot chubbier, so.  You know, I didn't want to say this, but she also said that your boobs are a little saggy.  Said your ass was a little wide, too.  I don't have a.  And she said something about it looks like you sat down in a gravel driveway.  What?  I said I don't have a size triple D fucking fake breasts, so my bad. 
[01:07:00]  I do believe they were double Ds.  Oh, okay.  So, I remember saying, I think Taylor has double Ds, and in between the licking, Taylor  gave me a thumbs up like, you got it.  She also said your ass looked like you sat on a bunch of pop rocks and then brushed it  off.  That's great.  That's great.  All right.  So, Taylor basically didn't think you were attractive, and that's why she didn't invite you to participate.  That's all.  That's fine.  So, what's wrong with her face?  What do you mean? 
[01:07:30]  Well, she's not that attractive either.  Huh?  She's not that attractive either.  She's what they call a porn attractive, okay?  A what attractive?  Porn attractive.  You'd fuck her into porn, but you wouldn't make her your girlfriend.  Oh, really?  Oh, right.  Okay.  Really.  Let's get good.  I'm going to just sit back.  Taylor?  Taylor, it's your turn for rebuttal.  Watch the light.  The only thing I can say is I got thousands of emails after the show on Friday saying how  hot I sounded, and then everybody went to the website, and from seeing the website, they 
[01:08:00]  had now confirmed what you guys were all saying about how hot I was.  Yeah, you're porn attractive.  There's no doubt about that, but how many of these guys that actually take you home should  meet their mother?  My mom did probably every one of them.  For a threesome.  Mom, mom, this girl was fucking on five men's cock.  And?  Your point is?  You would take that home to your mother?  Yeah, my father, actually. 
[01:08:30]  Okay, well, Raquel, how can you take pictures of me and I for your boyfriend because we were  so hot?  You took pictures, Raquel, with the lesbians?  Yeah, I did, yeah.  Absolutely.  Answer the question.  Because my boyfriend's addicted to porn, that's why.  All right, we're not getting anywhere with this.  No.  No, we're not.  We're going to agree to disagree.  Oh, boy.  We've had the debates, now it's your turn to decide.  Well, we're not. 
[01:09:00]  We're not.  Who's the bigger hose bag?  Presidential election here, so.  No, no.  All right, Raquel.  Point is?  Yeah?  Point is, I'm done.  All right, you are done.  Say your mom's box.  Your mom's box, please.  Your mom's box.  All right, and there she goes.  All right.  Famous last words of everybody on the program.  Thank you, Taylor.  Bye, Taylor.  All right, there she goes.  Bye.  There she goes, Taylor.  I like how Raquel did the dramatic hang-up and then has to call back.  Yeah, all right, I'll see you.  Okay, she spoke her piece and then I've had it.  Goodbye.  Mia, real fast, because we've got to move on to other things. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  I just can't believe she's, like, mad at us or something.  She was really nice, I mean, trying to be nice.  She came and dressed like a pigeon and took her clothes off and it just got worse after  that.  A pigeon.  She was supposed to be a black angel.  Like an angel.  She looked like a pigeon.  And once the clothes came off, it just got worse.  So, um.  What was so bad when she took her clothes off?  What was good?  I couldn't find anything. 
[01:10:00]  I like this Mia girl.  Yeah.  I didn't think you had the chops, but you're good.  I'm a very nice person, but when you get catty, I have to get catty back, I guess.  Well, Taylor noticed that she had something going on with her midsection.  There was a lot going on there.  That's the problem.  Ooh.  And you guys didn't want anything to do with her, huh?  No, I really don't think we did.  I guess she was pretty mad about that.  She still asked for her picture after the show, but when you work at Radio Shack, I  don't know.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  I'm heading off to a photo shoot, guys, and she's heading off to sell batteries.  I had a fun show.  You guys were awesome.  I had so much fun, and I'm really glad that she wasn't a part of that.  You know what?  I think we should hire Mia for the radio show.  That's pretty funny.  That would really piss off Raquel.  Anytime.  You guys got to get a couch in there, though.  I know.  Yeah, we will.  Well, the lady that was supposed to bring the couch in, she overslept.  Oh, God.  Was it Lady Di?  She was hungover or something and couldn't get down here from Rhode Island. 
[01:11:00]  I was hungover.  I made it.  Right on.  Thank you, Mia.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye, Mia.  Bye.  How funny is that?  I wasn't going to go to that phone call, but it was very good.  I'm off to a photo shoot.  She's off to sell batteries.  And batteries are such a good word for that line.  Oh, of course.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You want to start the fart game?  I'm scared.  Oh, right.  We had that.  Yeah, we got to get to the fart game.  Mm-hmm.  This is the last day we can play the fart game for a while. 
[01:11:30]  I know it's not me.  Yeah.  Can't play it when Jimmy's not here because I don't participate.  That is a rude and smelly game.  Well, maybe they could go back over the archives, and I'd love to call in and play the fart game  because I think there'd be a different angle on the phone.  Yes.  Well, here's the deal.  Jimmy and I cannot play the fart game.  It's usually either myself or Jimmy farting.  Right.  Who wants to play the fart game today?  Anthony, who do you want to take on? 
[01:12:00]  Steve?  Oh.  Steve played last time, right?  Yeah.  Why does Ben never play?  Ben should play.  Ben should play.  Ben's a sweet boy.  Yeah, let's get Ben in here.  Why don't we get, you want to get Martini Steve in here, or you want to do Ben?  How about Ben and Steve play today?  That's fine.  I don't have to play.  Why does Ben breathe like Jason Voorhees behind the mask?  You don't want to play this?  I got to do something. 
[01:12:30]  Why do you want to help Earl out with something?  Come on.  Oh, no.  There's no helping Earl.  The lost cause.  I was reading an email the other day, and people are saying they miss you in the studio.  Oh, okay.  No, I'm not even kidding.  They love you in the studio.  I'm not even kidding, because you will laugh just out of control at the best times.  Okay.  No, I'm not even kidding.  There's not even a bit after that.  You've got to show up in the studio every once in a while.  Martini Steve, take a seat.  You're going to play the part.  Whoa.  Don't touch the cake.  All right. 
[01:13:00]  There he goes.  I'm trying to convince Steve to change his voicemail to that on his cell phone.  It just plays that and goes to the message.  Ben thinks that would be hysterical.  I think it's funny.  I think it's funnier than those stupid songs you have going.  No.  Wait.  Did you say voicemail or the ringtone?  I thought the voicemail, but the ringtone, actually.  That's not a bad idea.  I wish I could figure out how to do that.  By the way, Steve, when are the hot girls coming?  Oh, these girls are great.  I'm not even turning around.  They're very lovely. 
[01:13:30]  The audio's not out there really.  Why do you ruin things, Opie?  I'm not ruining things.  Ben said that Steve was getting hot girls for the show today.  I love these girls.  We did.  They're real go-getters.  They are.  No, they are aspiring porn chicks.  Really?  Yes, they are.  Absolutely.  Maybe somebody will get their swank sucked.  Maybe.  Would you let them do that live on the show today, Jimmy, as you're going away thing?  Maybe for a second.  I remember one time...  We could cover up cameras and stuff.  Yeah, absolutely.  We could cover those up.  I bet you this big fat girl named DeAndra, who I used to work with at Bradley's, we were 
[01:14:00]  talking about oral sex, and she was like 350, and she's like, if he eat my honey, I'll  suck his swank.  Oh, he's really awful.  Yuck.  He eat my honey.  All right.  Here we go.  It's the fart game with Martini, Steve, and Ben.  All right?  We play a fart, and then these guys guess who farted, and then we get the answer, and  blah, blah, blah, blah.  Do we get the options of who it could have been?  I mean, how many people have done it besides Jim?  Well, that's the thing.  There's a couple.  Oprah's done it.  I've done it.  We've had a couple of guests do it. 
[01:14:30]  It's actually surprising sometimes who pulls it out.  In all fairness, it's either Jim or I.  Most times.  Most times.  Okay?  There might be a little trick.  A little curveball.  Trick fart.  A little curveball.  You never know.  Tricks are fun.  All right.  So why don't we play the just-made fart jingle, Anthony?  Oh, no.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That means this game is serious.  If they're making jingles for it, here's the fart jingle.  It's time to match up the gases with the sound of the asses and link up the stink with  a name.  Now that you've already smelled it, can you tell us who dealt it? 
[01:15:00]  Because it's time to play the fart game.  Whoa.  Hey.  Bravo.  Oh, well, Steve.  That was me and Danny.  That was a paycheck.  You're a grown man with a mortgage.  I am.  I certainly am.  Two mortgages.  Yeah, I know.  Do you realize you had to sit down with your wife in a bank and sign papers?  It's time to play the fart game.  She looks at you and thinks, this is the man I'm going to stop.  I know. 
[01:15:30]  I trust my financial future with.  I have that epiphany once a week, yeah.  And she is as normal as they come.  Yep, she really is.  She is the greatest.  She really is.  You don't deserve her.  And you know that, right?  And you know Stupid was holding both ears.  It's time to play the fart game.  Actually.  Eyes closed.  Did you sing it for her to get an opinion on it?  No, she hasn't heard it yet.  She hasn't heard it yet.  No, okay.  But it's not, both cans aren't on.  You've got one finger in one ear and the headphone on the other. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Who is that?  Oh, my God.  It is fucking Sasquatch.  Anyway.  You do hear that.  Yeah, I mentioned it before.  Yeah, I know you mentioned it, but I hadn't heard it. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Now I'm hearing it.  Yeah.  Ben.  What?  That is breathing?  I'm breathing?  I was breathing.  Wow.  I'm breathing?  You are breathing?  We wonder sometimes, too, Ben.  If Earl had asked that question, I would have an answer.  Obviously not.  Wow, that's some heavy breathing, man.  Ben, this is what it just sounded like.  We were all complete. 
[01:17:00]  I didn't realize it was.  I was writing.  So you had to breathe?  Yeah.  Strenuous.  Ben actually said that like I said I was running.  Dude, I was writing.  What do you expect?  A pen that's moving my elbow?  Wow.  Cool.  That's something.  All right.  So let's play the fart game.  I don't remember the fart jingle, so we better play that again.  Oh, jeez.  Can we play that again?  Derek, great.  It's time to match up the gases with the sound of the asses and link up the stink with a name.  Now that you've already smelled it, can you tell us who dealt it? 
[01:17:30]  Because it's time to play the fart game.  All right.  So we're going to play a fart.  Martini, Steve, and Ben will guess who farted, okay?  Here's the first fart.  What?  Jesus.  That's all you get, guys.  God, I want to play so bad.  You want to play it?  You can't play it?  No, I won't play it.  Oh, man, you might as well.  It's Jimmy's last day for a while.  It's for fun.  Play.  Yeah, you might as well play it.  All right, I'll play.  We're going to beat him anyway. 
[01:18:00]  All right, so it's Anthony, Ben, and Steve.  All right, we'll start with Ben.  Jim.  All right.  Ben's playing the odds.  Steve?  It's Jimmy.  And Anthony?  Yeah, that type of deliciousness isn't covered up with pants.  That was definitely, definitely, Jim.  Wow, I completely forgot about that.  You know what?  I know my farts.  Are you saying that's you?  No.  I'm going to say me.  Wow. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know the answer.  So here's the fart.  All right, let's get the answer to that first fart there.  You can play along at home, by the way.  Oh, you want to play games?  Yeah, I'll play games.  Point, Jimmy.  That's right.  Damn it.  I play in the majors.  You go play in the little cow league.  Is that the reason for all the Lysol?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We all have our own Lysol.  Well, what about Opie?  He cut one, too.  Mine don't smell.  Everyone knows that by now.  Rot little oatmeal farts.  That was a great one, because I farted, and then you said you want to play games, and 
[01:19:00]  I thought I had a good one that day.  It's the way it is, Opie.  I straighten everyone out.  That one was huge, yeah.  Yeah, so everyone got a point there, all right?  Take care of all small intestinal business.  Here's the next fart.  We know who that was.  Yeah.  That was a tentative shy boy's fart.  Listen to this thing.  That was your asshole apologizing as well.  I got to turn up the volume on it.  A little Pat from Unaki fart. 
[01:19:30]  That's awful.  All right, we'll go with Steve.  Steve, who farted?  That's you.  That's absolutely you.  All right.  Anthony?  Yeah, I'll say that's one of yours.  All right.  Ben?  Yep.  You.  Me?  All right, let's find the answer.  What's up, Ant?  What's up, Jimmy?  Go ahead, straining.  Oh, no.  Jeez, man.  I saw him lean forward like he was fucking Peter Finch and Network. 
[01:20:00]  Ready to deliver the news.  That makes me so happy.  It's horrible, isn't it?  Mine don't smell, though, for some reason.  Oh, stop it.  They really don't.  Yeah, yeah.  They smell like Hershey's Kisses.  Jimmy stick up the room, and for some reason, mine don't smell.  Yes, they do.  They really don't.  All right.  You guys got that one as well.  Congratulations.  Here is the next fart.  Please.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, that went tail.  Listen to the tail off.  That is a dangerous fart.  Oh.  It's just.  That's when you fart and you're being hugged by a large man, and he's squeezing all that  goodness out of you.  Thank you, Steve.  Steve.  Let me give you a little hug.  Steve, what did I tell you?  Sorry.  Don't encourage him.  I believe that the asshole that birthed that fart will be in Los Angeles. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  You say Jimmy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Ben?  Jim.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Oh, Jim.  Here's how I think it's me, because you can hear at the end.  I actually, what I'll do is I'll lift my leg.  Like, you ever see an umpire call a third strike when he yanks the arm back?  That's what I do, and that's why it tails out.  Oh.  I want you to picture that.  Wait, what happened?  What are you writing there, kid?  I'm getting a communique.  Are you writing, we better cover these cameras before Jim whips his dick out? 
[01:21:30]  Hope that's what you're writing.  Well, this is Danny's game, right, Danny?  Yes.  All right, so get our mic.  Get some credit today.  Don't be shy, kid.  I can't say that, though.  Why?  It'll ruin the game.  Oh, don't ruin the game.  So what do I do?  You just tell him.  Tell him what?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, Danny threw a little curve into this version of the fart game.  Whatever.  So let's find out what this is about.  Damn it.  I don't remember.  The creator of the fart game, Danny, everyone.  Let me tell you something.  I don't remember hearing that tail off.  Really?  That's true. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, damn it.  Well, I guess this is how I'll introduce it.  Everybody's wrong.  That was a decoy.  A decoy.  It's a decoy.  We would have commented on that tail off.  All right.  Just like we just did.  Well, here's the answer.  Here, I guess there's a third answer today.  Decoy.  Decoy.  Let me just say.  Yes, there's another decoy in the game today.  Wow.  All right.  So no one gets a point there.  All right.  Damn it.  It keeps it interesting.  Certainly does.  All right.  We're going to the next.  Let me see.  Okay.  Here we go.  How am I supposed to keep a heart on if I don't know who did it? 
[01:22:30]  Here's the next fart.  What the hell?  I don't know.  We're going to have to hear this one a couple of times.  Here we go.  They couldn't put two decoys in a row, could they?  Would they?  I wouldn't put it.  It's really up to you guys to figure it out.  I don't remember hearing that fart on the air. 
[01:23:00]  Do you know what that is?  That's the sound it makes when you're wearing sweatpants and you fart into the mouth of an invalid.  I'm going to say decoy because I don't remember hearing that.  It's Ben first.  Ben.  Decoy.  Ben's going decoy.  Yeah.  I'm at the risk of getting it horribly wrong.  That's decoy.  And Anthony?  I'll say decoy because I don't remember hearing that one.  Everyone's saying decoy.  All right?  It isn't, is it? 
[01:23:30]  What the?  Jimmy.  That was disgusting.  A dribbler.  Whoa.  There you have it.  That must be old.  How old was that one?  It sounds like my asshole got nervous and stuttered.  It did.  It went hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  By the way, the picture of Jim Norton sporting the wood from yesterday is now up online.  Holy crap.  This should be the cover of your next CD. 
[01:24:00]  It should be the cover of your next CD.  And look at our waiter to the right.  That's our waiter every time we go there.  So go to opianthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  There's Jimmy standing up taking a phone call as he's sporting a massive rod.  Jesus.  It wasn't massive.  It was a mediocre one.  All right.  Here we go.  So no one got that.  We still have a tie game.  We are horrible.  Tie game.  Let's go to the next.  Ow.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:24:30]  My finger.  My fur.  What happened?  It just cramped up.  Let me kiss.  All the clicking I had to do to get to this fucking picture on foundry.  Jesus.  Jesus.  We're fixing it.  How many links do you have to go through?  Click.  Here it is.  You go to opianthony.com.  Click on the link.  Jimmy's picture.  Click on the link.  Then it takes you to foundry.  To another little thing.  You got to click on a link there.  And then you get a thumbnail of the picture that you got to click on.  All of it is being fixed.  Oh, Jimmy.  What?  I can't help it.  I was shy. 
[01:25:00]  Jeez.  He's standing there actually pushing it out further.  It's very funny.  It's a very funny picture.  Very impressive.  My fat neck.  Look at the wig on the waiter.  We love that guy.  He really is a classic.  I was just about to say the exact same thing.  Oh, the waiter's behind him in that?  Look it.  That's the guy we love.  That's a guy.  Yeah, that's the guy.  Right.  I love him.  That's a wig.  I want to eat potato salad out of that thing so badly.  Androgynous.  Dolt.  He's very cool.  All right.  Here we go.  Without his wig, he looks like Pesci and JFK when he was dead on the couch. 
[01:25:30]  I can't throw my neck.  You've had it for years.  All right, guys.  Here we go.  Here's the next fart.  Ooh.  Mm-hmm.  That is definitely an Opie.  That's it.  They're quick, blunt trauma to the underpants.  They don't have that sharp, high treble that Jim's has. 
[01:26:00]  All right, Ben.  I'll say decoy.  Ooh.  I'm going to say Opie.  All right, two Opie's and a decoy.  I say that was an Opie.  How come Opie and I don't play just because it's our farts?  What do you think?  We recognize them?  Yes.  I think you would have.  I recognize most of them.  Like one of your young.  I don't even have to recognize it.  I don't even have to look.  This is definitely going to be one of mine.  It is yours.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and we'll continue with Tony from Sink Magazine after the break.  And then...  You totally nailed him. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, no.  Yes, that was me.  Yes.  All right.  So Anthony got a point.  Angel.  None for Ben and Steve got a point.  Ooh.  It's a tie game with Steve and Anthony.  Here is the next fart.  Let's go to Steve first. 
[01:27:00]  Steve, who farted?  Wow.  I'm going to say decoy.  Can I ask a question?  What were you just weighing in your mind?  Because it could have been Opie, but it could have been a decoy.  It definitely wasn't one of yours.  You actually went over base levels.  What did you actually just...  Let me think about this.  Yeah, I had to think about it.  What would Ramon say?  I'm playing to win.  Yeah, let's go inside this game a little.  When you guys are thinking, what are you thinking about?  I'm trying to picture whoever was...  If someone was actually positioned in front of the microphone, what was the sound that 
[01:27:30]  came out of it?  And I couldn't...  You know, I was bordering on you, Ope, but I couldn't commit.  So I said decoy.  Yeah, I couldn't...  It's all about tone.  Yeah, it really is.  One of yours.  All right, so...  It's an Opie.  And Steve, what did you say?  I said decoy.  Decoy and Ben?  Jim.  All right, wait a minute.  Oh, Ben playing for the point.  Jim.  Ben's a good boy.  I totally agree.  I said moi, Steve decoy.  Okay.  Here is the answer.  What's a lot of people here? 
[01:28:00]  Don't be scared.  Don't be scared, Jim.  There's cameras.  Put on your diaper right on my foot.  Come on.  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try again.  Go ahead.  Give it a shot.  Please, God.  I'm going to try again.  Oh, shit.  Oh, there you go.  Yes.  All right, that's another win for Anthony.  Point for me.  Anthony is pulling away here.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony's got four.  Steve's got three.  Ben's got two.  It's the fart game.  Just a couple more left, I believe.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Come on, Ben.  Jump on the team.  Come in for the big win.  Wow, that could be a Jimmy or a decoy. 
[01:28:30]  That sounds like a Travis, very middle of the road, a straight fart.  No chances being taken with that one.  Not at all.  Just guess.  All right.  Ant, it's to you, I guess.  I am going to say decoy.  Okay.  I concur.  That's a decoy.  All right, Ben.  Decoy.  Wow, you guys are all wrong.  No?  It's Jimmy, then. 
[01:29:00]  Shit.  Whoa.  What happened?  Hope was wrong.  That was a decoy, guys.  It was a decoy.  I'm really sorry, guys.  Oh, Ben.  You didn't know.  You're ruining everything.  You're so sorry.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're spurling it.  Everyone gets a little point there.  Wow.  Thanks, I'm sorry.  All right, I'm sorry.  I just knew that was a decoy because I would have laughed hysterically at that fart.  Where are you guys getting the decoys?  Those are courtesy of my armpit. 
[01:29:30]  Did I have real farts?  Good one.  I think the first one was.  Actually, the first decoy, I believe.  How about this?  They got to be real farts.  Yeah, definitely.  They got to come to that little delicious bottom you lug around.  I mean, I think it was trying, but it turns out our asses get shy.  Every time we had one ready, we just couldn't come to it.  What do you think?  Strawberry hit homers the first time he got up?  He struck out a few times.  You're absolutely right, Jimmy.  Here we go.  The next fart.  That isn't even a fart.  That's a Tesla coil. 
[01:30:00]  Doesn't that sound like electricity?  No.  That's something in Dr. Frankenstein's lab.  Let's go to Ben, who's trailing here.  Ben?  Jim.  All right, Jim.  Steve?  Sounds like a bare-ass Jimmy fart.  All right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I think it's mine because it sounds full-bodied.  Full-bodied?  It's got flavor, it's got texture, it's got personality. 
[01:30:30]  It's thin.  You accuse me of pondering.  Here's the answer.  Thanks a lot.  Tell George he stinks.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You sprayed my iPod, you fucking...  What are you doing?  Jesus.  Oh, God forbid he tries to spray your area after you showed up.  Take your iPod out of your ass then.  You can spray me.  You don't blast electronic equipment with a fucking... 
[01:31:00]  How do you turn it around where you get pissed at people?  You just farted...  Not only did he fart.  ...without your pants on, showing the most horrific ass.  Horrific?  My cheeks are supple and delicious.  Get the camera, boy.  Dude, your ass...  Your ass crack is, like, two feet long.  Oh.  Is it long?  Is my crack long?  That sounded like you sat down in a rubber chair with rubber pants on.  It had that squeaky, just flesh.  No muffling. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  It was cute.  Oh.  And we're back live.  Everyone gets a point.  Yes, that was Jimmy farting.  Yeah.  That was a nice one.  You hear that bare-ass sound.  It's just fantastic.  It brings this game to a new level.  Ugh.  All right.  We got two left.  The score.  Ann has six.  Ben has four.  Steve has five.  Wow.  And you know what these fans are probably just doing?  They're probably just using farts for the other games.  We'll never know.  Yeah.  We wouldn't.  Well, obviously, that's not a decoy. 
[01:32:00]  That's a double, man.  Two for Tuesday.  After he's panicking in the background.  I got to go what?  I think this was.  This must have been recorded after the show, right?  When we were doing a little production.  Okay.  And I would say that is.  It's a little more muffled, but I think this was before Jimmy started ripping his pants down.  I'll say Jimmy Norton. 
[01:32:30]  Jimmy again.  Yeah.  I know what was happening, too.  I think I know.  All right.  Yeah.  What you were saying was, oh, shit.  I got to go under the console and get my nose between those two lovely globes.  Under the console and get my nose between those two lovely globes.  Under the console to get my nose between those two lovely globes.  No, I know exactly what that was, and I'll wait until after you guys.  All right.  Go ahead.  Steve?  I think that's Jimmy.  Yeah.  All right.  And Ben?  Jim?  Yeah.  I think I was saying I got to go past him and get out of the studio, and I was panicking 
[01:33:00]  because he farted, and I had to walk through the fart cloud.  I think that's what it was.  Perhaps.  Here's the answer.  I, um, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You got it.  I just don't know if it's going to be substance or not.  Oh, no.  And I'm not saying anything.  No, it's not.  It's actually nothing.  No fucking way.  They're the worst.  No way, man.  You walk by the irradiated zones.  Baby, you're so shy, man.  You fucking farted.  We hit you.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  I got to go back in there.  There you go.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  That's what it was.  I love it.  And we're back live.  Everyone gets a point.  I had to go back into the hot zone.  I remember I left.  I walked past Jimmy.  He was walking out the door when he farted.  And then to my horror, I looked back and something I needed was back over here.  So I had to walk through the cloud.  All right.  Jeff in Jersey. 
[01:34:00]  Jeff.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  I'm sorry to interrupt the game, but, uh, Anthony, what the hell is a Tesla coil?  You don't know what a Tesla coil is?  No, I'm sorry.  I don't.  It, uh, it's, uh, one of those, uh, coils invented by Tesla.  And it, uh, it makes...  I thought they were just a band.  Yeah.  It actually makes an arcing, an arc of electricity at a very high voltage.  And it makes a crackly sound.  Well, how do you know that?  I think I was, uh...  Wait a minute.  Was it Discovery?  Yeah, it's Discovery Channel. 
[01:34:30]  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Yes.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right.  The final fart.  The fart game.  Easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's an easy one.  Well, I'm very confident.  Let's start with Ben, though.  Ben?  Opie.  Yep.  Indeed.  Yep.  Opie.  Yep.  Opie.  Yours always sound like the burp of a sick man. 
[01:35:00]  They're so muffled.  Poor guy has never done anything to us, but we're obsessed with how cool she is.  We like Bob Edwards on a personal level, but I'm sorry, he looks like a dead man when  he walks.  Stop it, Dracula.  Uh-oh.  Oh, God.  Ooh.  Opie.  Oh.  That sounded like an acid reflux burp.  I'm like, wow.  I can't stay in this room with you guys. 
[01:35:30]  That's it?  All right.  There you have it.  Yes, it was myself.  So, once again, Anthony wins the fart game.  Yes.  Bravo for me.  That's true.  Like a true queer.  I just, hanging out in here as the observer, I think I'm kind of getting used to who's  or who's.  It's pretty obvious, I think.  Yeah.  Most of these farts are very obvious.  All right.  Why don't we end the fart game with the fine fart jingle that Steve came up with? 
[01:36:00]  Hit it.  It's time to match up the gases with the sound of the asses and link up the stink with  a name.  Now that you've already smelled it, can you tell us who dealt it?  Because it's time to play the fart game.  Ian Anthony, XM 202.  For the entire 2006 college basketball season, XM Satellite Radio brings you great college  hoops action.

Here's Opie and Anthony, when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that, it's bad for you.  I flew home from Lansing, Michigan, which was brutal out there.  17 hours, 17 hours to get home from Michigan on Sunday. 
[01:39:30]  You had the layover in the airport?  In Detroit, in Detroit.  So I went and got a hotel room in some, you know, crack hotel, which kind of sort of bringing up bad memories, of course, now.  So, you know, but at least I had money in my pockets.  I just did a gig, you know, and I'm not dropping it.  And then you get back to here, to Newark, and I had to wait for a cab 45 minutes outside standing on the cab line.  It was, you know, when you look for the, you know, when the guys that you get off a plane, you have a ride, and they go, hey, you need a car, and you can get away from me. 
[01:40:00]  You know, I should call them.  I should tell the cops that you're here doing this illegally.  You know, and now I'm looking for one.  And, you know, I'm sniffing one out because they're all foreigners.  Nowhere to be found.  We've talked about those guys in the past.  The best is they have, is it Logan Airport?  Yeah.  Or is it whatever?  I think all the major airports have them.  Haven't now?  Yep.  They have the big signs that say, don't accept a ride from these guys.  And they have a picture of two guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's smiling at you going, hey, need a ride? 
[01:40:30]  And they got the little, like, ride hat on, and they're usually a little foreign and stuff.  Yeah.  And standing right next to those signs are guys that look exactly like the guys in the picture asking you for a ride.  Yeah, they're trying to make a few bucks.  They're not sanctioned by the city or anything, so they don't want you getting in there because, you know, there could be anybody.  It could be people that want to rob you.  Yeah, but see, that's not the case.  They just want the business.  They want the money.  Yeah, I mean, these guys, yeah, sure, it's a little shady, but they just want to make a living.  That's it.  Yeah, it's not like there's serial killers hanging out at LaGuardia Airport. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  You know?  It is weird, though, because sometimes, I remember once I got bamboozled.  I like taking sanctioned transportation.  I don't want to get into a vehicle with someone I have no idea who they are, what they're doing.  You know, they're not licensed, insured, you know, stuff like that.  And they'll come right up to you and go, taxi, sir, taxi, sir.  And you're like, yeah, you're looking for a taxi.  They grab your bags, and they start walking, and they walk right past the taxi stand, and they're like,  okay, follow me.  And you're way in the back in the parking lot. 
[01:41:30]  There's some cars with some shady people smoking pot.  I'm like, wait a minute.  No, this isn't a cab, you bastard.  You bamboozled me.  And then he's got your bags.  So you feel like you can't say, hey, sir, I don't want to ride with you, because, you  know, he'll do a feets, don't fail me now, and take off.  Right.  So you're kind of stuck, and you wind up getting in the car with these people.  And then they're driving, and you're like, this isn't the way to my home.  Hey, I just have to make a stop, okay?  I'll be right back out. 
[01:42:00]  No, I wanted to go home, and this guy's picking up a kilo to put under my seat, you know?  Bastard.  And it's Rich Voss.  I told you the time I thought I was going to die in Nassau, right?  The Bahamas?  Yeah.  We went to this restaurant, and then we were going back to the hotel.  We left the resort, which is just stupid.  Yeah.  Absolutely stupid.  Never leave the compound.  When you're in the Bahamas in that area.  Dumb.  And we get a cab.  I think I told a story on the air.  And they're so laid back and slow down there that we jump in this cab, and all of a sudden, 
[01:42:30]  I'm thinking to myself, this isn't the way back to the hotel.  What is it?  Oh, and then you start thinking, oh, my God, was this a legal cab?  Mister, this isn't the way home.  Dude, barely speaks English, got the dreads, the Jamaican music is cranking, and then, like,  the president of the Bahamas is having some kind of press conference.  He always is.  Every time I go down there and I'm in a cab, they're listening to some president giving a  dress.  Yeah, and all of a sudden, I mean, the roads start getting darker and darker, and it's kind 
[01:43:00]  of industrial.  Now, do you mean, what do you mean, darker?  I mean, a few things.  There's not many streetlights out, Anthony.  And what was the driver smoking a big blunt?  He's going, it's all good, man.  No, he was kind of a weird dude, you know?  And then I'll get to that part.  So then we're in, like, an industrial section.  We pull into a parking lot, and all of a sudden, the guy just gets out.  Oh, great.  Oh, my God.  Is he getting one of his accomplices to rob us? 
[01:43:30]  Come out there, rob you.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, we're just sitting there, like, what are you going to do?  It's not like I could get out and run for it, because I don't know where they're going  to live.  You are, and you're in a bad neighborhood.  And then I'm kind of taking a peek, and he's just, ha, ha, ha, yeah, I'm on.  He's having a conversation with his buddy.  Oh, my God.  And then they light up a spleef, and they're smoking, and I'm just sitting there patiently  waiting.  You know, what am I going to do?  What are you going to do?  Complain?  And then I realize I'm probably going to be okay, that he just needed to socialize  with this guy, and maybe make a drug deal. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, but you're paying for a ride.  Oh, I know.  I'm watching the meter just kind of tick, tick just slightly.  Nothing too drastic.  What a set of balls.  It probably cost me an extra $5, $10.  No big deal, you know, but I'm watching it tick, because there's nothing else to watch.  And then 15, 20 minutes go by, and the guy comes back into the cab and drives us back  to the resort.  You didn't ask him, like, hey.  No.  Who was that?  Then I was asking people.  What was that about?  I was asking people, like, back at the resort, and they're like, that's how it is down here.  People, it's not like New York, where everyone's in a hurry. 
[01:44:30]  You know, they go about their business.  Oh, yeah, they're working, sort of.  But, you know, he knew he was passing his buddy, you know, between the restaurant and  the resort, and he's like, oh, good opportunity to stop by and socialize a little bit and  have a little pot.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, but that's when you're scared that the country's going to be overthrown or something.  Right, yeah, the president's on there.  You're making a speech, they're ripping across the casino, throwing the slot machines out.  You're hearing gunfire in the background of the president's speech on the radio.  What the hell?  And you hear it outside the car. 
[01:45:00]  What the hell?  I love the death ride from the airport to the resort.  You know, they got these beautiful resorts down there.  You go there, everything you could possibly want or need.  And you get the death ride on the way there.  Some nut in a van doing 800 miles an hour down some windy road.  On the wrong side of the road.  Yeah.  Or you think it's the wrong side of the road until you realize, oh, wait, we're in, like,  England or something.  Yeah.  It's like a province of what?  Oh, okay, we're allowed to.  Okay, good.  Frightening.  But at first, you have no idea.  You think the guy's just high on some kind of freaking, you know, rum or something. 
[01:45:30]  That's why I'm taking my kids.  Is that, where's the Atlantis?  Is that the Bahamas?  Atlantis is Bahamas.  You see, before they built that, when you went down there, there was, there wasn't something  nice.  That's like a compound.  You go there and you're completely.  You don't leave it.  You don't leave it.  No, no.  You want to feel like you're down there, but you're still in Connecticut.  That was still being built.  Very good.  That was still being built, but there was some nice restaurants in that area.  That's why I went over there.  I took, when I was married, I took my wife to Aruba. 
[01:46:00]  I went to Aruba, which is probably one of the most expensive places you'll ever go.  I'm serious.  We were in some hotel there, La Cabana, and there was a little store downstairs, and we  walked downstairs to get even just like a loaf of bread.  You know, now we're making sandwiches in the room where at that point, you know, I lost  money in the casino.  Of course you did.  And so, it was seven bucks.  And we get home, and the day we get home, or the day after, she goes, I want a divorce.  Bitch, you couldn't have told me that before I took you to Aruba, okay? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, how much did you drop on her?  I dropped all kinds of money.  Well, I might as well get one more vacation out of the zero and move on.  I swear to God.  Oh, poor bastard.  That's the last place.  Atlantis is great.  You're going down there?  Yeah, yeah.  You're sending your kids.  No, I'm taking them.  I booked a gig, and, you know, I booked stuff for vacations.  Is that what you do?  You book a gig, you get paid, and you're on vacation?  Are you performing at Atlantis?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or are you there?  At the Atlantis.  That's great.  Yeah.  I mean, on my honeymoon, I booked a gig.  I told you that.  This place is beautiful. 
[01:47:00]  That's what I hear.  I hear it's really nice.  There's like...  Nice.  Casino.  Nice.  I don't care about that.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, poor addicts, man.  There's golf courses and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  I let my kids take turns to carry my bag, the clubs.  You know?  Hey, little one, get the...  It's a par three.  You carry it on to par three.  She's the little one.  The big one, you know, par fives.  You got to watch the guys on the beach, though.  What's that?  With your daughters.  I don't know.  I've seen some pictures now.  They're getting a little older and stuff, and you get these guys with the dreads coming 
[01:47:30]  up.  Yeah, but they know right away.  Jet ski.  Jet ski, man.  They know right away.  They do?  Yeah.  How?  What are you going to do?  We have a rule.  We have a rule.  What?  No collards.  No.  Holy ass.  What is wrong with you?  That's a rule.  Well, we agreed.  We sat and talked.  I showed them, you know, pictures.  Like, you know, when you were a kid, and they try to keep you off drugs, and they showed  you...  You know, I just show them stuff.  You had a presentation?  Yeah.  Clips.  Slides. 
[01:48:00]  Slides.  Courtroom trials, and...  You're an awful racist.  You really are the worst.  I hope your daughter brings Patrice home.  Yeah, that'll happen.  She doesn't live up in a tree.  What is wrong with you?  No, Patrice is...  Patrice is coming in at 8.30.  Petting your daughter's belly, saying, come on, come on.  Oh, God.  He's bringing in his sex toys later.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  They're disinfected.  All right, we gotta catch up a little bit, so we're gonna take another break.  Really quick, though.  And then we should talk about some of the stuff happening in the news today.  Just a sick story, man.  Some actress was blown away last night.  Oh, good old New York City.  It's the front page of the Post.  Gotta love the senseless murders.  Yeah, we'll talk about that and other things going on in the world, Anthony.  The world.  Right.  Cab rides in Kenya.  God, you know, you want to go to break, but...  Kenya?  Kenya, who would ever go to Kenya?  Chris...  They might take a cab. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, you guys?  Cab rides in Kenya, it says on the screen.  Yeah, I was...  I was over in Somalia for about six months, and what happened was I went on R&R for about...  Can you all hear me?  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay, sorry about that.  I love people that say that.  We're actually good listeners.  Yeah, we're listening to you.  We know how to shut up.  I get that in my real life, too.  Like, someone will start telling a story on the phone, and I'll just shut up, because I listen. 
[01:49:30]  Not many people listen in this world.  So I'm listening, and that's what everyone always says, because they're not used to it.  Are you still there?  I'm listening to your story.  All right, go ahead, Chris.  All right, yeah, I was in Somalia for about six months, and I went on R&R to Kenya.  And we were taken off from the airport to the resort.  We were staying right there on the Indian Ocean, the place that got wiped out by the tsunami.  And what happened was we get in a cab, and it's like these little cabs from London, you know, 
[01:50:00]  like you see with the front, one seat's facing forward, one seat's facing backward.  And we'd already gotten drunk on the plane and everything, and we're flying from the airport  and doing exactly like what you're talking about.  We're doing about 90 miles an hour, and I'm facing backwards.  And the whole time, the dude's sitting there, you know, offering to sell you dope and everything like that.  And I'm like, shit, man.  But it was like, give me a window to puke out of here, man, because everything's flying by, 
[01:50:30]  and I'm looking backwards, and I'm like, oh, God, I'm going to puke, man.  Please pull over and puke.  Just when you think our cab drivers...  That's about it, man.  It was pretty fun.  Just when you think our cab drivers here are animals, you know, just go out of the country.  From Somalia to Kenya, that's going from, like, Nork to Camden.  He's going for R&R.  What kind of R&R is that?  Rape and robbery.  Run, run, run.  Run, cracker, run.  R&R.  Yeah, well, these cabbies, when you go on vacation, they're jack-of-all-trades. 
[01:51:00]  They're not cabbies.  That's just one of many jobs.  They're drug dealers.  They're also your pot dealers.  Pimps.  Pimps.  Right?  Whatever you want.  And they also run the jet skis when you get to the beach.  Imagine if you got into a cab here in New York, because they are really regulated, these cabbies.  And he starts offering to sell you drugs and stuff, or get you whores.  The guy would be in the cover of the post the next day, and the guy would just be executed.  But that's business as usual, and those little crappy resort towns. 
[01:51:30]  All right, we're going to go to break.  Jim Norton's not here today.  Rich Voss filling in, doing a great job.  Great hanging out.  Voss, Norton's in Albany this weekend, and where's that?  We should plug it again.  Comedy Works in Albany, if you're in the area.  And as we go to break, we got Jim Norton's CD in studio again today.  Yellow Discipline.  You can get it off eatabullet.com.  Yes, Anthony?  Carlos from Jersey saying, this guy's full of shit.  He was never in Somalia.  This story happened this week on The Amazing Race. 
[01:52:00]  Is that true?  Are people calling up with Amazing Race stories and telling them as their own?  Because that's really funny if that really...  Wouldn't that be funny to watch a show and you call it a radio show?  Yeah, this happened, and it's exactly what happens on television.  Could be a new bit.  Could be a new bit.  Well, if that's true, then he got us.  What the hell?  Yeah, we'll believe anything.  It's funny.  I should also say that Rich Voss is playing Rascals this weekend.  Which one?  Oh, no, there used to be two.  Now there's one, right?  Moncler or something.  Moncler, not something.  In Moncler.  Moncler, Rascals, Rich Voss. 
[01:52:30]  Norton calls me last night on his way to Albany.  He goes, let's go into Albany.  How long does it take to get you?  Like, all of a sudden, I'm fucking MapQuest.  How long does it take to get you?  I don't know.  Call your mother.  Leave me alone.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  Hi, guys.  Yeah, I'm living with a bunch of roommates, and one of them has AIDS.  And he was all mad at me because I was taking my finger and eating the peanut butter out of it.  And he got all pissed off at me, and he had AIDS.  Yeah, wow. 
[01:53:00]  That's a fascinating story.  Yeah, well, it's cool.  I'm a bike messenger here in San Francisco.  Yeah, and this guy's really stupid.  He's got AIDS.  Did I say he had AIDS?  I hate him.  Yeah, but I think they're going to kick me out of the house.  Really?  That sounds tragic.  Very funny, but I think you're dating yourself a little bit.  Oh, I know.  That's an old, old one.  When did that happen?  In 1992?  I know, right?  I don't watch reality shows anymore.  I hear the hell. 
[01:53:30]  Who would do one?  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  Ramone, a true test of dexterity, skill, and, oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess.  Oh, not again.  Ramone, wash my balls.  And now, a minute with the New York Times.  Here's sports editor Tom Jolly.  I was among those who said that for the World Baseball Classic to truly mean something,  they'd have to play it after the season. 
[01:54:00]  I've changed my mind, in part because of the Women's NCAA Basketball Tournament.  Sounds odd, I know, but here's what I'm getting at.  We tend to measure sports events against each other instead of enjoying them for what they are.  Many fans of women's basketball measure their tournament against the men's tournament.  The media plays into it.  Witness the fuss when Candace Parker dunked in a tournament game for the first time ever.  It was a big deal because it's what the men do.  They seem to forget that the biggest complaint about the men's game is that it's all about dunking.  Where's the one place you can still see playmaking and passing?  In the women's game. 
[01:54:30]  Which brings me back to the World Baseball Classic.  Why not play it in March?  When was the last time spring training was this much fun?  Now it's easier to appreciate that every major league team is essentially an all-star team of the best players in the world.  And the World Series matches the best of those teams.  I'm Tom Jolly, sports editor of the New York Times.  When I think about the streak, I think about all the games I ever played in.  I came to the ballpark every day with a desire to play.  My father taught me to put myself in the hands of the manager as he decides who will play each day to win the game. 
[01:55:00]  The streak was a collection of individual days that I was selected.  And before long, there was the streak.  Managers like Frank Robinson, Earl Weaver, Johnny Oates, and others wrote my name in the lineup day after day and created the streak.  I am proud of the fact that my managers felt I was worthy to be in the lineup day after day.  I never set out to break Lou Gehrig's record, but I am proud to be tied to one of the greatest players in baseball history.  What began on May 30th, 1982, and continues September 6th, 1995. 
[01:55:30]  This game with the Angels trailing is now in the books.  And let it be said that number eight, Cal Ripken Jr., has reached the unreachable star.  This is Jim Blassingame, the Small Business Advocate with the Small Business Minute.  If you like everything about who you are and will never want to change, don't follow the path of an entrepreneur.  Because the forces in the world of small business will change you. 
[01:56:00]  If you survive, you will become smarter, tougher, more self-confident, more aware of your instincts,  and know more about what you're made of than ever before, if you survive.  Historian Charles Francis Adams, Jr. once observed that during the Civil War,  President Abraham Lincoln developed immensely.  He became, in fact, another being.  History, indeed, hardly presents an analogous case of education through trial.  As a small business owner, you will acquire an education through trial, and it will change you. 
[01:56:30]  Armed with that understanding, you can embrace the education, value the change, and develop immensely.  Write this on a rock.  If you don't like change, don't become a small business owner.  This is Jim Blassingame, the Small Business Advocate.  I'll see you on the radio or on the internet at smallbusinessadvocate.com.

[01:57:00]  Say, Jim, nice meal.  The worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Is this some sexual reference?  A new world war.  This is murder music, man.  You just have to kill people with this. 
[01:57:30]  I love it.  It rocks!  Let's get Al Jorgensen in here.  Yeah.  He's a legend.  We are just some no-class motherfuckers in here.  We go out and get a bottle of wine, and can't even get, like, one nice wine glass to have around here.  He's drinking it out of one of the Starbucks cups.  The Starbucks I ever had.  Yeah?  The best Starbucks I ever had.  I was saying, though, we're some no-class motherfuckers.  We should have had some wine glasses or something.  You know those cheesy corporate parties you go to where they have those snap-together wine glasses, those plastic ones? 
[01:58:00]  Even one of those would have been better than a Starbucks cup.  I think it kind of ruins the wine when you pour it in that wax-coated cup.  He doesn't give a shit.  Look at him.  Nah.  Oh, let me get your mic on.  There you go.  Hey, Al.  Welcome to Satellite Radio, buddy.  Pinkies up.  Pinkies up.  Pinkies.  How's the wine?  It was 40 bucks.  Not good enough.  Hawk pulled it out of his ass.  Pretty good?  Then good enough.  Not bad?  Yeah, it's not bad.  You're going to like it?  I can't pronounce it, but it's not bad.  Yeah, try to pronounce that.  Oh, Breton, Leroy, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier. 
[01:58:30]  Margot.  That's what it is.  You were a wine aficionado?  Is that what people are saying?  I used to be until I got here today, man.  See?  We don't fuck.  What do we know?  We suck.  Dude, he's got your beat over here.  What was he got?  Red Bull?  No, fuck the Red Bull.  He's been eating pot lollipops.  Pot lollipops.  Pot lollipops.  That's Joe Rogan from Fear Factor, by the way.  What's up, dude?  And that's Bill Burr, a very funny guy to you right there. 
[01:59:00]  Uh-oh.  Some kind of...  Good, Joe.  I'm just watching Joe on TV.  There's some poor broad hanging from a landing gear of an airplane.  Yeah, Fear Factor's on right now.  How is this legal?  How is it even legal?  Do you remember doing this one, Joe?  Vaguely?  Vaguely.  I don't know.  There's something in an airplane.  I was probably thinking about Pluto or something while this was going on.  There you are, man.  Ooh, what a nice shirt.  Wearing a nice burgundy shirt.  You look all concerned.  You got a couple of girls with big tits on. 
[01:59:30]  I'm very concerned.  What are you yelling into with some earpiece in her ear?  No, she can't hear me.  Nah.  No.  You just snap below it.  She's looking high up there.  That is really high up, man.  Yeah.  3,000 feet or something.  That's scary shit.  Do you have a contingency plan for people dying?  Have you guys talked about what if someone died?  I think what they're going to do is if somebody dies, they're going to gun everybody down and  blame it on the terrorists.  Is that it?  Don't let the terrorists take away your fear factor.  With new host, Adam Carolla.  Wait.  All right.  How do you think Nicole and Stephanie are going to do? 
[02:00:00]  I'm going to be shocked if they do it.  It's hard.  All right.  It's nice meeting you.  Take it easy.  Get out of here.  Bye, guys.  Take care, Tiffany.  I'm going to check on.  Joe's all stoned.  Joe's psyched now.  He's good.  I would have left to win the $50,000, but I would have really left to walk away.  I like the walk of shame.  Yeah, the walk of shame is the best.  Just get the fuck out of here, you failure.  That's so dumb.  He hates doing that show.  Come on.  Who wouldn't want this show, though?  But he's so serious.  It's like he said. 
[02:00:30]  You go on.  Everyone else has to do the work.  Everyone else is climbing around on aircraft and being dropped.  That's the vats of dog shit.  It's been 10 years.  I'll show something cool right now.  I can do a handstand for like 30 seconds.  Let's see it, baby.  Come on.  Yeah.  Damn.  I used to make my sister do handstands and nightgowns.  My sister's friends.  That's pretty badass.  Wonderful.  And my sister.  You ready?  Yeah.  Go take some ass.  I'm betting on you.  All right.  I can't say that anymore, by the way.  Why?  I can't say kick ass anymore.  Can't say that.  Why?  They told you not to say kick ass. 
[02:01:00]  Not only that.  They told me I can't say hell anymore.  I can't say, all right, let's get the hell out of here.  You can't say hell.  Are you kidding?  No, no, no.  The lowest rung on the bad word food chain.  That is the lowest rung.  Yeah.  Hell?  Yeah.  An imaginary world where the bad guy lives in a land of fire.  You can't fucking say that anymore.  How fucking stupider people.  You can't say hell anymore.  Whoa.  That's like the only progress we've made in regards to religion is that if you bring up the devil, people think you're fucking crazy.  You can talk about God all you want. 
[02:01:30]  You know, the president can talk about God on television, but if you ever got on TV and said, we found Satan in Afghanistan and we're tracking him by radar, you'd be like, okay, what the fuck?  Satan's bad.  Right, but if there's a God, there's got to be a Satan, right?  Doesn't it work like that?  They never talk about it.  What about cock and pussy?  Those are two different things you could, in context, right?  I don't think, if you can't say hell, I'd be willing to say cock and pussy on Fear Factor out of the question.  Don't you have cats on Fear Factor?  Cocks or roosters and pussy is a cat, right?  Yeah, I don't think that. 
[02:02:00]  You know that wouldn't fly?  You can't hold up a dead cat and Joe Rogan will say, you have to eat this pussy to get through to the next level.  I don't see it happening.  It's got to be legal.  Yeah, to paddle the cock, which is this rooster in a cage here.  Eat the pussy to paddle the cock.  You're afraid of the cock, are you?  Afraid of the cock, little lady?  Our kid's Fear Factor?  A bunch of people want to say hi to Al.  Let's go to Tim in Illinois.  Go away!  What's up, Tim?  Al, I used to love eating lots of acid and listen to your music back in the day. 
[02:02:30]  Me too.  Eating lots of acid.  Thanks, Doc.  Thanks, dude.  I ain't got shit else to say.  Punch it out.  Wow.  That's all he had?  Well, that was pretty enlightening.  A lot of people give you big respect there, Al.  Ministry was the single most important influence in the sound and concept of Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor, 2005.  He said that?  Hell yeah.  What a pussy cuck.  Hell.  Hell.  Hell. 
[02:03:00]  And Scott Ian from Anthrax said, I'm not a religious man, but I've been a faithful follower  and member of Al's ministry for over 20 years.  He's got that right.  He's not a religious man.  Yeah, I know that.  Well, you've been around a long time.  What do you think of today's music?  I think I'm getting pretty old.  Is that it?  I'm like, what, 69, 70 years old now or some shit?  Hold it up.  25 years.  That's gross, man.  25 years.  My liver is pissed that I've been in this music business that long, man. 
[02:03:30]  Do you listen to anything new?  No.  No?  I hate music.  Don't like it all?  I really do hate music.  Really?  I watch Fear Factor and wait for them to say cock and pussy.  That about takes up my whole night.  You'll never get a straight answer.  We've got two people in the studio that hate what they're doing.  Right, Joe?  But it pays well.  Yeah, that's funny.  But it pays well.  No, he obviously does it.  What is it?  Your chat there.  I thought I saw a Blue Oyster Cult thing going on there.  That is a Blue Oyster Cult thing going on. 
[02:04:00]  That shows you again.  I mean, that was like, what, 1931 when they were big or something?  They got me through the war, the big one.  The big one.  He's got hermit's hermits across his back.  This guy's going to be around forever.  A lot of people giving you legendary status, saying you're a fucking legend.  Uh-oh.  That's not, I don't know how good a thing that is in rock music.  Well, it gets me out of some speeding tickets.  Does it?  Other than that, it's not really worth much. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  What do you do with yourself these days, touring?  Not yet.  No?  No.  Recording?  It's the big one coming up.  The big one's coming up?  Yeah, we got Revolting Cox opening for ministry on this tour,  which is going to probably require an oxygen tank from me when I'm done doing both shows, right?  Come out in a walker for ministry, I think, but...  You can't be that old.  I'm getting there, dude.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I'm 46.  My liver's about 91, so it gets a little bit hard for the second show. 
[02:05:00]  Live the life the whole time you've been in that?  Just pump a bunch of Viagra before each show.  I don't think you need a hard-on to get it on.  That'd be interesting.  I could just get a cucumber.  Half of the sandwich.  Gets in the way of the guitar.  Half of the sandwich.  He's playing it so far from his body.  Hey, wait a second.  If you play your guitar over your cock, you're not a guitar player.  You've got to be able to hang it down over your cock, so you've got to wear your guitars low.  I hate those guys that wear the high waistband golf pants and then wear their guitars up higher like those old jazz cats. 
[02:05:30]  That's disgusting, man.  It's like back in the 60s, the early 60s, the English guys were way up high like that.  Exactly.  George Harrison was way up high like that.  Disgusting.  Yeah.  You've got to wear its sling like a gun slinger.  That's what he died from.  It's like high guitar disease.  Is that it?  Yeah.  He gave him a tumor from being up so close to his chest.  Let's go to Rev on Wackbag.  Rev, what's up?  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to ask Al if you got any shit from anyone on the religious right for nicknaming himself Al-Qaeda for a while there. 
[02:06:00]  Oh.  Did you call yourself Al-Qaeda?  I was Al-Qaeda, then I was Al Jazeera, and I've been Al lots of things.  Alchemy, aluminum, alcohol, you name it.  So, I mean, that was just a little phase.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got shit from the right.  I mean, why wouldn't I?  That's awesome.  And that's what you were gunning for?  I love those guys, man.  I mean, for a while they had me on some religious right website that had me like public enemy number two behind Michael Moore, which was- 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  That was pretty good.  Hard to get past Michael Moore.  That's sweet.  In a lot of different ways.  Yeah, hard to get around them.  Yeah, so why did you choose that?  Just to give them shit or-  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Not a big fan of Bush, are you?  I wouldn't think you're a fan of Al-Qaeda, though, either.  No, I'm not a fan of any of them bastards, you know?  I'm a fan of-  Either side, right?  Yeah, you know, some are fans.  Alcohol, fanned.  Al-Qaeda, not a fan.  Al is a handy name to have.  Isn't it?  It's great, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  With anything behind it like that.  Not a fan of Bush, obviously.  No, no.  No?  You'll never see Al Bush, either.  No, no.  What did you think of the last election of John Kerry?  Did you vote for him, or did you think he was another asshole?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I mean, it's just the whole special interest group thing that runs the government is what  we really got to dismantle, these little prop-up cardboard cutouts that they put up.  The problem with Bush, here's the problem with Bush.  In a sense, I almost appreciate Reagan now, because at least Reagan knew he wasn't running 
[02:07:30]  things.  He was just acting as president, right?  Yeah.  As an actor.  And Bush actually thinks he is, which is creepy.  I mean, he actually thinks he's running things and shit.  We were talking in the office about Bush and how much, like, I just can't stand him.  And I was a supporter of him early on.  And when you look at somebody, even like Reagan or Clinton, for that matter, two opposite ends  of the spectrum, you remember during their presidency, them sitting at their desk at the Oval Office 
[02:08:00]  and signing shit.  Yeah.  Whatever they were doing.  At least.  It was a bill for the environment, or it was some kind of tax thing that Reagan was doing  that no one liked, but he felt strongly about it or something.  It was something.  When, you never see Bush in the Oval Office working.  No.  The guy has done nothing as far as getting this clearing in.  Listen, you know what was cool about Clinton and all them shots of him signing shit in  the Oval Office is you know he was getting a hummer underneath the desk at the same time. 
[02:08:30]  Or he had to move the page because, like, he's got a cum stain on it.  Imagine, like, some fucking important bill.  You put it on your desk, and a little cum starts seeping through where you signed it  and smudges your signature.  How wonderful that is.  But you never see Bush doing anything.  He's always giving the same fucking speech every time.  He's up there, evil El Cata, we've got to deal with it.  It's always about freedom.  It's pretty good.  We're staying the course and do it.  And he's never working as president. 
[02:09:00]  What do you think about the Inquirer story that he's drinking?  Yeah.  Again, you think so?  Absolutely.  Well, I think the Inquirer said, I think now that his poll numbers are, his poll numbers  are like, what, 31% approval?  His poll numbers are in the shitter.  He's got the war.  He's got two fucking major disasters that were, one of them, you know, the first one at  least, a complete cloud.  He's probably back on the crack, too.  Well, someone else has said that he's...  I think so, because, you know, if you're president, you know you've got a good deal.  What room do you go to to smoke crack if you're the president?  What room is this?  Sure enough. 
[02:09:30]  That's a basement thing.  That's got to be a cube with no window.  Incoming nuclear weapon from Russia.  That room that's left over.  Right.  That's the room you smoke crack in.  Can you imagine having that kind of power, though, man?  One time, I wound up at this party with Ronald Reagan Jr.  Yeah.  Okay, so the first thing I asked him was like, have you ever beat off in the White House?  I mean, it's like, I had to ask...  Is that the first?  That's the very first thing, because I've always wondered that.  It's like, you know, did you put on Nancy's dresses and kind of whack it and like pretend  to pick up the red phone and start a nuclear war or some kind of crazy shit, right? 
[02:10:00]  Sure.  So I asked him that.  Give him a lollipop, man.  And he was like, no, no, no, no, no.  I never beat off in the White House.  I'm like, get out of here.  That's the first thing I would do if I ever was invited to the White House.  So I'd go beat off in every room.  It'd just be a gas, right?  Jacking in the Lincoln bedroom.  Jacking in the Lincoln room, right?  But he denied it.  So I finally just kept on him and on him.  He goes, all right, all right, all right.  When I was nine and my dad lived in the governor's office, I did let my Labrador retrievers pee  on me on the front lawn.  I'm like, you'll admit to that, but you won't admit to whacking it in the White House? 
[02:10:30]  There's a golden shower from his dogs.  That's fucked up, man.  He's a strange guy.  Yeah, he is, man.  Ronald Reagan Jr. was always a strange guy.  Yeah, they kind of tried to keep him under wraps.  And then he got a lot of publicity.  Hardcore Democrat.  Yeah.  Kind of against his dad.  Stranger.  But like I was saying, though, at least back then.  He can't be a Democrat.  He didn't whack it in the White House.  Not a good Democrat.  Yeah, I know.  What kind of Democrat are you? 
[02:11:00]  Ask Al about ministry's piss army.  What is that?  That's kind of like our kiss army.  Kiss army.  It's the golden version of the kiss army.  All right.  What do you think of other guys that are supposedly the legendary status, like guys from Kiss?  Gene Simmons, you see him out there hawking his stuff.  Yeah, that's kind of weird.  I'm not really into that, man.  I mean, it's like, well, I'm also jealous, too. 
[02:11:30]  He says he's, what, had sex with 11,000 women a year or something.  You've got a wedding ring on, right?  You've got to think the caliber of those.  Yeah, I've got a wedding ring.  I have sex with one gal a year.  We were just talking about marriage.  Well, not once a year, but once a gal.  Right, right.  Joe Rogan, not a fan of marriage.  She doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me.  Yeah.  How long have you been married?  Uh, what?  Oops, I'm in trouble.  Oh, is that her right there?  Yeah.  There you go.  How long?  Three years.  Three years?  Yeah, three beautiful, golden, amazing years. 
[02:12:00]  There you go.  Things going well?  Yeah.  Sign a prenup?  No.  No?  I'm fucked.  You are so screwed, my friend.  That's it.  Way to fucking go, Al.  Half those tats are hers.  His next tour will be playing a Yooka-Laylee.  Yeah, a Yooka-Laylee.  Yeah.  Coffee houses and bongos for me, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  Not that she isn't lovely, and I'm sure you two get along. 
[02:12:30]  What made you get married?  We were at Graceland.  Yeah?  Believe it or not, that's the answer.  And that does it?  I don't know.  Elvis says some kind of magic, weird shit.  We got married at Graceland.  You see a vision, get married.  Lose all your shit.  No, Graceland is bizarre to get married in, man.  They have all these-  You got married in Graceland?  In Graceland, yeah.  All right?  At the little chapel behind in his backyard or whatever.  And as you go all through Graceland, they have all these fucking rocks that are like,  you know, fake rocks, fake things that have speakers in it that whenever you pass by the 
[02:13:00]  rock, it has some kind of motion sensor, and it says Elvis thing, so you think you're  losing your fucking mind the whole time you're walking around there.  Elvis?  You're hearing like, hey, man, don't worry.  It's going to be okay.  It's all going to be okay, man.  Go ahead and get married, man.  It's all right.  Really?  Seriously.  It's creepy.  It is fucked up.  He's the most whored out performer ever.  Ever.  Elvis Cooper.  Oh, yeah.  I went there, and I wanted to laugh at him, and I actually went into his house, and I  felt bad for him.  Like, I wanted to laugh at all his furniture and shit, and it's just like, people just walking 
[02:13:30]  up to his grave, taking pictures and shit.  It's just like, can you let the guy go?  No.  Never.  No, they can't.  Speakers that speak his voice as you're walking through, like, ghostly advice?  What does he fucking say?  No, no.  This is a true story.  All right.  So, we're at the altar, at the little chapel, me and Angie, and I'm sweating, because I've  already had one really ruinous, failed, horrible, shitty-ass marriage, right? 
[02:14:00]  So, why would you do it again?  Well, because she's great, okay?  But, and not only that, we're at Graceland.  I got caught up in the moment, and I'm really glad I did.  But, at any rate, I'm at the altar, so I go, look, I got to take a piss.  I got to take a piss.  So, I left Angie at the altar, went to go take a piss, and in the actual bathroom, next  to the altar, there's an escape door.  Get out of here.  For guys, I swear to God, there's an escape door, in case you just want to, like, bolt  at the last second.  Does that rock say, run, man?  Just run. 
[02:14:30]  No, no.  Take off, man.  So, I'm in there looking at the door.  I'm throwing water on my face, because I'm kind of like, man, do I really want to do  this?  I don't know.  And I'm looking at the escape door in the back, which is open, which actually, you can  haul ass and run, right?  And I'm throwing water on my face.  All of a sudden, I hear, through the speakers, it's all wrong, man.  It's all going to be okay.  And they do that shit on purpose.  I swear, I talked to Pastor, what was his name?  Pastor Bear.  Pastor Bear was the guy who looked exactly like Jerry Falwell. 
[02:15:00]  It was creepy, man.  Yeah, it was creepy.  Jerry Falwell married us, basically.  And, yeah, they got Elvis piped through everything.  Everything, man.  It's creepy.  It's sad, man.  Did you plan on getting married there, or did you just get there and go, hey, let's get  married?  Last minute thing, yeah.  That's one of those places that people like Vegas and there, people just decide.  Me and Brittany, you know, it's the same kind of deal.  His house is, like, hooked up from, like, it was like his house was this shit in, like,  1972.  Yeah.  See, he has, like, Elvis used to like to watch all the football games. 
[02:15:30]  And he has, like, three TVs that are, like, the kind you have, like, in your kitchen on  the counter that you don't even fucking have cable hooked up to.  The Zenith.  That we were talking about yesterday.  Zenith TVs to watch the football.  The Trinitron.  Yeah.  That's a hell of a way to get married there, Al.  Thanks, guys.  They left everything like it was at the time.  You know, hey, that's great.  You are really going to polish off that bottle.  How many bottles do you say you go through a day?  About 17. 
[02:16:00]  17?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  No way.  Well, in between three and 17.  How many?  How many?  One.  She's saying one.  So the truth lies somewhere in the middle, which is pulling up your spot over there.  Oh, you're asking me what she allows me to drink before the rolling pin comes out over  the head.  That's one.  She don't look like a rolling pin type.  It's only 10.30.  He's already done with his first one.  It's a hell of a piece.  Hey, we got Mark from Iowa.  Go ahead, Mark.  I was going to say, Al should change his name to Al Amoni. 
[02:16:30]  Hey, thanks a lot, asshole.  Very good.  Very nice.  Very nice.  That's a funny one.  Go ahead.  Spread that idea around.  Nice job.  Some guy called Radio Guy.  Radio Guy.  Hey, hey.  I just wanted to ask Al about, you know, back in the day, he used to sound like the Pet Shop  Boys.  So I was wondering what he thinks about, you know, what the music they did back then.  Do they still get fans coming, like asking for that kind of crap?  Hell no, man.  I killed the pets.  What? 
[02:17:00]  But the earlier music was more what?  The earlier music was complete crap.  The record label had me basically like Milli Vanilli.  Ouch.  Without the dreads.  Oh, it was great.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, seriously, I had stuff written for that record that wound up two records later  because the label I was on was like, they appointed a producer, they wrote the songs,  they wrote the choruses, they appointed everyone for me, and I just sat around like, when do  I lip sync?  And what year was this about?  83.  83, and it was that type of like, Pet Shop Boys sound? 
[02:17:30]  Disgusting, yeah.  I've longed this on my record.  Any songs we would know from that?  I hope not.  Well, look it up.  You got any?  Fuck you, man.  That's it.  I'm two bottles now.  I hope he just leaped right on it.  Let's look it up, man.  Look it up.  Look it up.  Listen, I just went through hell this morning on ESPN, all right?  I'm a Blackhawks fan, lifer, and the first thing they show when I'm on there is the 1971  shot of Henri Richard in Game 7 against the Canadians in 71, beating Tony Esposito. 
[02:18:00]  I was curled up in fetal position, started sucking my thumb and crying, whimpering like  a baby on ESPN.  Now you guys are going to fuck with me hard on this, too?  You guys suck.  We have fucked.  The thing is, though, we've brought out our first ever broadcast on the radio, mine and  Opie's, and it's horrific.  It's impossible to listen to.  So Jimmy Norton brought his first tape of doing comedy, and it's one of those things. 
[02:18:30]  It's a cringe moment.  2004, 2002.  Sometimes you just have to sit through.  But I'm only allowed one cringe a day.  Is that it?  All right.  I already had my cringe moment.  2005.  Keep going.  Nathaniel will never find it.  You'll probably get lucky, and it won't be on the left.  I will kick your ass, dude.  Seriously.  I'm going through that bulletproof glass fucking window, and I'm totally terrified.  We got Joe Rogan.  We're not scared.  He will.  All right.  He will kill you.  How's that for a Fear Factor episode?  Will you jump through that window and kill that man?  This looks like a murder.  There's a girl with an electric eel in a tank surrounding her head. 
[02:19:00]  The other morays.  Oh, moray?  I remember this episode.  Morays are nasty, too, though, right?  Yeah, they're dangerous.  They'll bite your face off.  They bit the shit out of one of the guys that was handling it.  In our master computer, we don't have the 1983 stuff.  Hey, dude, get some brown recluses on your show.  Look what they did to me.  Check that out.  What the fuck is that?  What are those?  I got bit by a brown recluse.  They wanted to take my arm off.  What is a brown recluse?  Oh, it's a crazy spider.  It's a fucking asshole, brown, hairy spider, man.  Yeah.  In Austin, Texas.  Is that what those divots are?  It looks like someone took an awl. 
[02:19:30]  No, no.  See this right here?  Where was that?  In Austin.  Texas?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Got them bugs there?  The thing swelled up like Popeye's arm, right?  And I'm like, I'll just do some Benadryl.  I hate fucking doctors.  So I'm like eating Benadryl.  I'm just like, ain't going to go.  But they're finally like, dude, now your finger is, this middle finger is the size of like a fucking kielbasa, right?  So they're like, you got to go to the hospital.  So I go to the hospital.  I'm thinking they're going to give me some antibiotics or something.  I go in there and the first thing they say is, well, we have to take that arm off now.  Holy shit. 
[02:20:00]  And I'm like, whoa, wait a minute.  I don't play fucking drums for Def Leppard.  Okay?  I'm a guitar player.  And I think there's only one one-armed guitar player.  And that's the guy the Pope keeps hostage in the Vatican that plays classical guitar with his feet.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that guy?  That guy rules.  He's not allowed to leave either.  They have him hostage in there.  We got to free the one-armed fucking guitar player from the Vatican.  So I was like, tell him that.  So they made me sign something saying like, well, if I die from the poison, I can't sue them and all this shit. 
[02:20:30]  I'm like, whatever, dude.  I'm not playing drums for Def Leppard.  What did they have to do to your arm?  They had to cut it open from the middle finger all the way up.  Holy shit.  And drain the fucking poison.  Across the palm of your hand.  I drove to the hospital with a kielbasa like this.  Through the wrist up to your elbow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Ay-ya.  So they wanted to just chop it off right away.  Oh, yeah.  They were like, you're gone, dude.  You're going to die.  And I'm like, no, no, no.  So what do they do?  From a spider. 
[02:21:00]  What do they do after they open it up?  They drain the poison and shit.  It's like, what fucking year is this?  But here's how creepy the whole medical system is.  Right as they're putting me under, right?  With the wonderful gas.  Yeah.  I love that shit.  It's pretty cool.  Anyways.  Right as they're putting me under.  Here comes another fucking legal beagle with a piece of paper and a pen.  As I'm starting to nod off, they're going, and you also can't sue us if they fuck up your tattoos. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  I mean, they're all worried about everything, man.  I'm like, look, just keep my fucking arm.  I don't care about the tattoos, dude.  I'm not playing drums for Def Leppard, okay?  Did you say to him after all is said and done, do you call up that doctor and go, you are going to cut my fucking arm off and it's fine now?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is the guy, like, lazy?  Yeah.  Yeah, totally.  It's like you bring a piece of shit car in.  That's a total, man.  We'll get you into something else.  Dude, yeah.  Hey, they cut my toe off in Texas.  They're butchers there.  Can I see it?  What did they do to your toe?  I got infected. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, Angie doesn't want us to see your toe.  Another spider.  Why?  No, I'm showing my toe.  Yeah, right on.  Last time I was here, I thumped my, whatever, on a microphone and kind of freaked Bodhi out.  But the toe is actually cooler, see?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I thought you.  They cut it off.  I thought you meant one of the little ones.  They cut it off.  Holy crap.  No, no, no.  The toe is gone.  It took out the big one.  The big toe is completely gone.  Oh, you want this?  You want a close-up?  Yeah.  Well, should I whack it while you're like?  Say it.  No.  What?  You sold? 
[02:22:30]  I sold my toe for rock and roll.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Completely gone.  What?  Joe Rogan, are you freaked out?  Nah, Joe's seen too much.  After I saw that guy get fucked by the horse, I'm okay.  Joe has seen too much.  In a weird way, it makes it more aerodynamic.  Yeah, wouldn't the foot be better without the big toe?  No, no, no.  It's more efficient.  It's kind of freaky because, like, I was shoplifting sunglasses right after I got out of jail at  this Citgo.  You know, I was going to sit and go.  He's the lead singer of the ministry.  Jesus.  Well, it's just... 
[02:23:00]  Got a big hole in your socks?  It's for sport.  You ever go to the beach?  Yeah, well, you know...  How do you handle that flip-flop thing?  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  I got to...  It's got to take it off.  I know, I know.  Flip-flop thing is out of the question, dude.  Forget it.  Do you tape it?  All right, listen.  Do I tape it?  Wait, I want to...  No, I staple it.  Get some duct tape.  I staple it.  I want to hear the...  Dude, I got a roadie that actually has webbed feet to make up for my missing toe.  Oh, my gosh.  I want to hear the shoplifting story. 
[02:23:30]  All right, so I'm in there shoplifting sunglasses.  And this black chick comes in on crutches.  It's a theme today.  I'm just freaking out, man, like really struggling.  I go, you know, I'm trying to make conversation because I see that the fucking guy's staring  at me by the sunglasses so I know I'm going to get busted.  So I'm like trying to play nicey, right?  So I'm talking to her and she's like, I just had my toe amputated.  I'm like, so did I.  When?  And she's like, three months before I did.  And I go, you're on crutches?  She's like, yeah, the doctor told me I'd be on crutches for six months. 
[02:24:00]  I was out there.  I walked out the next day.  And so I went back.  I called my doctor that took my toe off.  And, oh, first of all, I wouldn't give it back.  I wanted to wear it as an earring or some shit.  I was like, the fuckers took it and sent it to CDC for some reason or whatever to see  if it was toxic or glowing or toxic toe.  So I called my doctor and he's like, well, I've never quite seen this where we take a  big toe off and somebody walks right out of the hospital.  And he goes, the only thing I could probably fathom is that you've just been so high and 
[02:24:30]  drunk all your life.  You're used to walking out of equilibrium, right?  So apparently, now I'm like normal without the toe.  It balanced things out.  It balanced things out.  You never said, how did you lose it?  Oh, I stepped on some fucking splinter that I left in there for like, goddamn, I don't  know.  Are you shitting me?  I thought it was another spider or something.  No, no.  Dude, the spider's got it in for me, dude.  I'm fucked.  And didn't want to go to the doctor or something to get it out? 
[02:25:00]  I hate doctors.  Dude, every time I go there, they take a part off me.  Well, it's because you're waiting.  You know, he does have a point.  I think he's missing the connection.  I think he's missing the arm.  Yeah.  There's a lesson to be learned.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I got it, guys.  It must have turned black or something, right?  Yeah, it turned.  It's total.  Did you at least take pictures of it before they hacked it off?  No, dude.  I thought it was fine.  I thought, eat a couple Benadryl, it'll go away.  That Benadryl. 
[02:25:30]  Where'd you get the idea that was a cure-all?  I know, man.  That Benadryl stock is just dropping.  Al Jorgensen of Ministry.  You're all right, man.  That's great, man.  We got the picture of your missing big toe up online already.  Wow, that was fast.  That was really fast.  Damn, is that fast?  You guys are stoked.  That's a real fucking rock star right there.  Sold my toe for rock and roll.  Wow.  It looks like your other toe is making up for your big toe.  It's getting bigger or something. 
[02:26:00]  Getting wider.  No, it's pissed.  It's pissed.  It's got to take over the top.  It's got to do all this extra work.  Twice the work.  Exactly.  Twice the work, half the pay.  A bunch of little kids like the dad left.  They're all fucking angry.  You're the man now.  That first toe had to become the man of the family before he even wanted to.  I didn't have a childhood.  It was the dad raising the other toes when he was 16.  Look, man.  I didn't want it, but this little piggy is now the breadwinner. 
[02:26:30]  Let's go to Elmer.  Elmer, what's up?  Elmer.  Hey, what's up, man?  I want you to ask Al about the time he blew up his tour bus.  Al, you blowed up your tour bus?  Well, yeah.  I got shrapnel in my eardrum.  I took a couple of Benadryl.  No, no.  It was fine.  It was actually probably the fucking coolest thing with my eyes that I've ever seen.  Really?  I mean, probably the birth of my daughter with a close second, I'm blowing up the tour bus.  And now what happened? 
[02:27:00]  Okay, so first I have to preface this by saying when I was in Nashville, Tennessee on the Lollapalooza  tour in 90, oh, back in 93, kids.  Anyway, so this toothless old man at this truck stop where we go in and shop with sunglasses,  like me, it's like, hey, you guys want to buy some fireworks?  I'm like, yeah, yeah, cool.  All right, great.  Oh, shit. 
[02:27:30]  Don't take long to put two and two together here.  So I went behind the Petra.  There's a Petra truck stop.  And I bought this what looked like a fucking bazooka.  I mean, it was like six feet long metal tube.  All right?  And we like to have fun with fireworks.  Anyways, I mean, we wake each other up on the bunks with like M-80s and shit in the bunk.  Like, wake up, fucker.  Boom.  You know?  So we're kind of prone to that anyway.  Lose a thumb.  But this was a fucking bazooka, dude. 
[02:28:00]  But I was like, yeah, it was cheap.  It was like 50 bucks.  It's like, yeah, awesome.  Bring it, you know?  And I forgot about it.  I set it up on there.  And then Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers was traveling with us for a while, too.  So Gibby got into our M-80 supply that we usually throw at each other and shit.  And so Gibby's like, hey, man, let's light these up on the bus.  I'm like, oh, that is so lame, man.  We do that every day.  What's wrong with you?  Here.  Oh, I remember.  I got this fucking six-foot pyro on here. 
[02:28:30]  So we're in the back of the bus.  We light the fucking thing.  And this thing, the guy told me, I remember the Toothless guy told me, it's supposed to  make like a pirate ship in the air or some shit.  It's supposed to make this galleon with multicolored shit.  So we light the thing in the bus while we're rolling down the highway between Houston and  Dallas, right?  Where are you aiming at?  We're in the very back lounge because that's the only place I'm allowed to be. 
[02:29:00]  I go right to the back of the bus, right?  Holy shit.  So we light it.  And I'm laughing.  I'm thinking, all right, we're going to put it out, okay?  I'll light it and just freak everyone out a little bit.  The thing's a professional pyro.  It's got an underwater fuse.  You cannot put it out.  So we're like, you have to cut it in front of it, right?  And no one has scissors.  So everyone just scrambles out of the back room and just, whoa, diving into Buns.  And it's down to me, Gibby, and this guy named Greg Workman who runs Ipecac Records. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  And we're all passing the thing back and forth going, you take it, you take it, you take it,  you take it, you take it, you take it, you take it.  Fun, funny cartoon.  So it was totally, yeah, it was, you know, Acme Explosives.  So at that point, Gibby jumps down into the final open bunk, shuts the curtain and hunkers  down.  Me and Greg are still passing it back and forth.  I finally go, Greg, that's it, man.  I'm out of here.  And so Greg, like, just gets down on one knee at the very back of the bus and aims it for 
[02:30:00]  the front of the bus.  That's all you can do.  Booyah!  The thing goes off and they had the front door closed up front because the rest of the  band, a bunch of straight edge guys playing bridge or some shit up there.  And they always, like, thought we were disgusting.  So they always put us in the back of the bus.  And even for them, this was pretty cool.  It's like, or not uncool, I should say.  It's just like, you know, what was that explosion?  Because this explosion comes up, starts hitting the door between the front and the back of the 
[02:30:30]  bus like this ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping,  ping, ping, ping, all these pellets.  It was pellets bounce off the door and catch every bunk on fire.  All right?  And the great thing about this was is every fire was a different color.  Because it's like, it was like Apocalypse Now on the fucking bridge scene, dude.  With Lance doing that.  So the whole bus is on this colored fire.  All of a sudden, the brakes slam on.  The bus driver's like, that's it.  I'm calling the police. 
[02:31:00]  You motherfuckers.  My bus is on fire.  I'm calling the police right now.  So he makes us all get off the bus.  Take everything off.  You're kicked off.  You're kicked off.  So we had a keg of beer on tap in the back.  So we grabbed that, left our luggage on.  Just grabbed the keg of beer.  Went off and waited for the cops, right?  So the cops come up and see this bus on the side of the road with purple, orange, green smoke pouring.  Pouring out of the thing, man.  I mean, you're so psychedelic, right?  A crow's nest on top and sparklers. 
[02:31:30]  These guys were right out of fucking Dukes of Hazzard.  These state troopers that came up like, boy.  And the bus driver's jumping up and down, literally having a tantrum, but jumping like, hey, I want these boys in jail.  They ruined my bus.  They ruined my bus and all that shit.  And the fucking cop looks at him and just goes, boy, get these boys back on the bus.  What'd you expect?  These are rockers.  This ain't Mozart.  Which is awesome because we're sitting here pouring like drinks off a keg of beer on the side of the road, laughing our ass off while the bus driver has no solution to this, man. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, that's pretty cool.  You gotta know that's bad if it's gonna make a galleon.  It's not like a sparkler or fucking like an aerial bomb or something.  If something's gonna make a galleon, there's a lot of shit in there that's gonna burn.  Well, dude, the recoil sent Greg like three feet in the air.  What a great fucking story.  That's the greatest tour bus story ever. 
[02:32:30]  Ever.  It wasn't that great.  It cost us, what, $63,000?  In hindsight, it's gotta be worth it.  No, no, it's worth it.  At least $63,000.  Yeah, I know.  Pirate ship line is the best.  The colored smoke was the best, dude.  That was so apocalypse now.  God, I wish you had video of that.  That would've been insane.  Kind of a little bit hectic to get a little bit of video camera going, man.  You take it, you take it, you take it, you take it, you take it.  Great shit, man.  By the way, people are checking out your missing toe picture like crazy.  Cool.  On opiananthony.com. 
[02:33:00]  That's Al Jorgensen of Ministry.  Let's say hi to Scott in good old Tennessee.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, Al, I was just wondering when the next album's coming out, man.  Yeah, we should do some business here, right?  When you said Tennessee, I thought he was gonna go,  Hey, Al's the one that sold you that.  All the tooth is good.  When's the next album coming out?  Well, I mean, I got one out today or something.  They want me to show, but they being the label.  What's out today?  Rantology. 
[02:33:30]  And what's that about?  I don't know.  You keep asking me all them hard questions, man.  Is it what?  Is it remixes or something?  It's a bunch of shit on there.  You're not happy with it?  No, it's all great.  I thought so.  This guy rocks.  Al rocks.  Derek, you got a little something to play for Al Jorgensen?  Oh, you fucking...  I will attack.  Go ahead, play it.  Oh, you suck. 
[02:34:00]  That's it.  Oh, my God!  Make it stop!  Make it stop!  From 1983...  Shut the fuck up.  No!  You suck.  Seriously, after I'm done here, you are so getting your ass kicked.  What were you wearing when you were singing this?  What was I wearing?  Did you have like a vest with like no shirt?  Yeah, that and a G-string, some high points.  We all have our crosses to bear from the past, my friend. 
[02:34:30]  All right, hey, make this equal opportunity.  Play his first shit over there.  Yeah, it's really bad.  All right.  It's really bad.  There you go, fuckhead.  Nice job.  I'm so happy with you right now.  I can't believe Derek was brave enough to do that.  No, that's pretty cool.  He's got some balls.  I may spare his life and just beat him to an inch of it.  How's that?  We'll spare him, though.  Let's spare him.  Wow.  That's terrific.  No, it's not.  It's 1983.  I ain't come here to get insulted. 
[02:35:00]  I could do that everywhere.  We thought we were all getting along.  What the hell?  No, it's all peaceful.  And we got your bottle of wine.  We had to, you know, make fun of you.  Well, it's gone.  It was a bottle of wine.  It was a bottle of wine.  I was going to ask you for a little bit.  Now it's a projectile.  All right.  This has been a hell of a show, I've got to tell you.  Hell of a show.  Hey, this is the Alien for Ministry, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Ants.

[02:40:00]  More manufacturers now offer it in their consumer cars.  Hi, I'm Dave Graveline for Into Tomorrow.  BMW plans to offer a night vision system to their 5 and 6 series vehicles in the U.S.  Their infrared thermal imager penetrates 1,000 feet of darkness and fog to give drivers early warning of potential hazards.  Pedestrians and animals alike light up with thermal signatures, alerting motorists to their presence far earlier than headlights alone.  Cadillac offered a similar system a few years ago, but BMW believes its in-dash display will provide drivers with an early warning that only an infrared night vision system can provide. 
[02:40:30]  While offering an alternative to the heads-up display, it says drivers found distracting.  Learn more about night vision at bmw.com.  Looking forward through the darkness and Into Tomorrow, I'm Dave Graveline.  When you have a moment, please swing by our side at graveline.com.  The Technophile. 
[02:41:00]  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  For a while, the TV network said that people who skipped commercials using digital video recorders like the TiVo were thieves.  Meanwhile, people who shell out $50 to $100 a month for cable didn't appreciate the accusation.  The networks are finally coming to terms with the fact that people are consuming entertainment in a different way now.  Several shows are available for purchase online at the Apple iTunes store for $2.  And the old model of television, where it was free and there were commercials in between, is coming back online. 
[02:41:30]  ABC has announced they'll be putting shows online that have commercials included.  Anyone can download and watch the shows for free.  ABC will have an exact count of how many people downloaded and watched a show, and then they can sell advertising.  Programs such as Lost, Grey's Anatomy, and Desperate Housewives will be available for free online.  If the experiment works, you can expect to see other networks follow suit.  I'm L-A-Z-L-O-W dot com.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language. 
[02:42:00]  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or XM-CANADA at 877-438-9677.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, gee.  You know what?  I hate to do this to Voss, but we've got to teach him a lesson.  You guys talk.  I've got to find something.  He was really bothered that he didn't have a good appearance on our show yesterday or two days ago.  Really bothered.  But his bad appearances are good. 
[02:42:30]  I think people like when he falls on his face.  There are people that hate myself, Anthony, Norton, but we don't care.  We don't take it personally.  We know enough people like what we do on the show that it works.  Simple as that.  Voss is one of these guys.  One person says he stinks and he can't handle it.  And we've been trying to tell him you can't listen to the fans.  Even though it's a lot more people than that.  He's one of the funniest guys in the business.  And he worries about one or two dumbbells who don't like him. 
[02:43:00]  So who cares, dude?  So he posted on our message board, whackbag.com.  He did?  What's Voss' name on the message board?  Voss.  Oh, there you go.  It's all about him.  Also, opianthony.net, another great message board.  They're not getting plugs.  Enough plugs.  Opie Anthony or just Opie Anthony?  Opie Anthony.  Here's Voss.  Voss is on the phone.  This is what Voss wrote overnight.  Last night at 11 o'clock.  Here's the deal.  You've got to do it in the Voss voice.  Well, then you've got to do it. 
[02:43:30]  No.  Just do this.  No, I'm...  Do an impression so people have to drink.  No, I don't do it, Voss.  All right, then just read.  Do a voice, Opie.  I do some fine impressions on this show, but Voss is not one of them.  But you've just got to do this with your teeth.  Just put spit in your teeth.  No, no, I can't.  No?  You want to do it yourself?  No, no, no, no, no.  Go ahead.  Just picture Voss' voice.  All right.  I can't.  Picture if you will.  Here's the deal.  When I go...  Funny post.  No, you've got to do it as Voss.  No, go ahead.  Jimmy, read a line.  I don't do Voss.  Ant does Voss. 
[02:44:00]  Ant will do it.  No, go ahead.  I think it will.  Just read.  All right.  Here's the deal.  When I go into O&A, it's to hang out.  If I come up with something funny, good.  And if I don't, oh, well.  I am not...  I am not B-interviewed.  There's Voss for you.  I am not B-interviewed?  I am not B-interviewed.  I am not B-interviewed.  Yeah, it's not like it has an edit feature that you can read it over and edit your post if  there's any...  I'm certainly not helping him out today.  I am not B-interviewed. 
[02:44:30]  He probably meant B-Arthur.  So I...  I...  So I like most other...  Holy crap.  Listen to this sentence.  I am not B-interviewed, comma, so I, like most other comics, will throw shit out when  I can.  I don't step on other people when they are talking, so I get stuff in when I can.  When there are other guests on and I think they should be trashed, that's where I try  to shine.  Now for Kid Nigg.  I guess that's another member of the board.  He's addressing individuals now.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  He's obsessed.  Dude, this guy was on a network TV show for two seasons and one lousy poster on whackbed.com  got to him.  Although, let me jump in.  I don't mind addressing a guy.  If a guy posts bad about you or whatever, you address it.  That's cool.  But it's like to really let it bother you.  I love...  I always answer real hate now.  Well, this is the funny part about this.  You read this post and he's trying to act like it doesn't really bother him.  But you can tell he's just so bothered.  He says, oh, well.  Yeah.  Whenever you say, oh, well, you're bothered. 
[02:45:30]  So now for Kid Nigg.  I am not sure if you are the same spook that use to post.  Use S-E?  That use to post.  Use to post?  Yeah.  Wait, how is that spelled?  U-S-E.  U-S-E.  Now for Kid Nigg.  T-O?  Yeah, use to.  Use to.  Not use to.  Yeah.  Use to.  Use to.  Now for Kid Nigg.  I'm not sure if you are the same spook that use to post on the other board.  Because I can't smell through my computer. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, my God.  He's really pissed off.  He's funny on the message board.  If you don't think I'm funny, that's fine.  You won't come to any of my shows.  And that will be one less primate that the club won't have to worry about.  Holy Jesus, Voss.  And we tried to calm him down after the show.  Like, dude, not every appearance is going to be great.  And actually, he gave us some great radio that day with the ear thing and stuff.  And he had some great lines.  I see that you called me a hack.  I will give you the benefit of the doubt and not get too mad maybe when you were typing 
[02:46:30]  your bottom lip was hitting the wrong keys and you didn't mean to spell hack.  Holy.  Oh, man.  Perfect.  Cause, would a hack be writing for the Oscars?  He is writing for the Oscars this year.  He has to throw that in there.  Yes, he is.  Or would a hack.  I'm sure Chris Rock, who he's writing for, will be happy to hear these things he's written  on the message board.  Stupid ass Voss.  Oh, we'll make sure that Chris Rock gets a copy of this.  Cause that's what friends are for.  Send it to Chris Rock.  Cause, would a hack be writing for the Oscars? 
[02:47:00]  Or would a hack make 12 grand last week?  Or be on network TV two years in a row?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe he's writing this stuff.  Nobody called me a hack.  So, maybe you just made a mistake.  Kind of like your mom when the load that created you trickled out of her ass and slid into  her Brillo hair smelly catcher's mitt she calls her drink ticket.  Sounds like the best part of you dribbled out of your mom's ass into her Brillo catcher's  mitt and she calls her drink ticket. 
[02:47:30]  Got to be Sergeant Voss.  Wow.  He is an angry Jew.  And then he finishes up by saying, just a mistake she should have wiped.  It happens to the best of us.  Voss.  Kidding!  How tall are you?  He is so bothered.  Oh, could you just picture those stubby little fingers just flailing away on the keyboard  all angry?  No, it's this.  It's Peck.  Oh, he's a Peck.  Where's the A? 
[02:48:00]  Where's the A?  A?  A?  Let's go with the T.  T, okay.  What did Kid Nigg write?  I don't know what Kid Nigg...  Probably just said that he had an awful appearance and doesn't like him.  There are people that don't like all of us.  Somebody will go to the message board.  We have our haters out there.  Yeah, you get them.  So what?  Yeah.  Norton ruins the show.  You guys, you go.  Why do you have...  I just address them and you don't want to bother you.  Numerically, it's going to happen. 
[02:48:30]  So what?  Well, you do ruin the show.  No, no.  I'm not saying I don't know.  But I, you know, I'm just trying to say, but...  Oh, we just don't know how to tell you.  No, but I don't really...  We just don't know how to tell you off air, so we might as well just kind of make...  No, but I...  We might as well just make believe it's a bit and we'll just make believe that...  No, but oh, by...  For the air, we'll just...  But oh, by...  God, why would you even say something like that?  What?  Because that'll get them like thinking that maybe it really is.  No, well, maybe it's time he, you know, reached between the lines.  You don't understand.  I'm here to pick up a check.  Jesus.  I think, Eric, I saw him run over to the computer. 
[02:49:00]  I think he's looking for Kid Nigg's email or post that got Voss so angered.  Hot under the collar.  It's got him so Steve under the collar that he is writing racist remarks.  He's writing all kinds of racist remarks, really busting apart the Jewish stereotype that  Jews really are intolerant of the African-American people.  Just instantly goes to Voss playing the race card. 
[02:49:30]  Don't be mad at me just because we made movies that made fools out of you in the 70s and you  allowed it.  Jesus, Voss.  This is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing Season 1 and Season 3.

No.  Once again, we're doing American Mess.  You wouldn't know it by listening to the show today because no one showed up. 
[02:53:30]  Unbelievable.  We are giving you an opportunity to be a huge star on this fine radio show that a lot of people seem to like.  And this is the second week in a row that no one really showed up.  It's an open call every Friday.  Well, I think once that guy had the humpback, took his eye out and his teeth out of him, he set the bar so high.  But we're also looking for people like this guy, you know?  There's nothing wrong with him physically except for the scary stare.  Yeah.  But we're looking for, like, unique people.  Yeah, and I think we found one.  Whether it's something wrong with your body or some kind of strange talent. 
[02:54:00]  Yes.  That is a rogue cop if I ever seen one.  A rogue cop.  Yeah.  Cop gone bad.  He's just, he left the program.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm a mess.  You're a mess?  Yeah.  I'm going to get a closer look at you.  Wow.  I spent all my money, I won $50,000 in the lottery, and now I'm not eligible for free medication anymore.  And I'm probably going to end up homeless.  And I spent it all on lottery tickets again. 
[02:54:30]  Really?  That's terrific.  It really is terrific.  That's terrific.  That's the minute, people.  Yeah, we're getting you on the webcam.  So what do you like to do when you're not being mistaken for Brian Dennehy?  I do stand-up comedy.  A full metal jacket all the way with that stare.  Move the mic so it's more away from his face.  You know what I like?  I like it.  You ever like, like I do kind of thing, you know?  That's the sport coat every cop wears when they're going to put a black guy in jail with, like, no evidence. 
[02:55:00]  You're just up there, just lying.  Wait, no.  Your copy looks like you're seeing Dog Day Afternoon.  Give us all drinks.  Give us all drinks.  The guy that's trying to calm Pacino down.  Ant, no.  I had brain surgery, too.  I got hit by a car and had brain surgery.  Yeah?  That's not the reason I'm going to do that.  You got hit by a car.  This guy is funny.  This is part of his act.  I love it.  I like his act.  Yeah, let's hear what's your opening joke in your stand-up.  Yeah, my opening joke. 
[02:55:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, keep it going for Bill the Psycho.  Come on.  This comedy set is dedicated to all the deaf schizophrenics that can't hear their voices and to all the schizophrenics that thought they were Jesus.  They all drown.  It's not a bad one.  It gets a laugh in the clubs.  Yeah, it's not bad.  Keep going.  I hit it.  But seriously, folks.  Yeah, just keep going.  Last time I had a girlfriend was in the mental hospital. 
[02:56:00]  We never really broke up.  We just each underwent shock treatments and forgot we were dating.  That was a problem when I was in the mental hospital.  I used to forget things.  Like I used to loan some really creepy guy named Jeff $5, and I'd forget I loaned to him after I got shock treatments.  So I got smart.  So I'm writing things down of things I needed to remember.  And here's a list from like 10 or 15 years ago of things I need to remember after I got shock treatments.  Stop eating so much, you fat ass.  Convince angry black Muslim roommate I'm not the devil. 
[02:56:30]  Vanilla ice rocks.  Jeffrey Dahmer owes you $5.  Holy shit.  I think the setup was a little wordy.  Yeah, I know.  But I think you got something.  No, it gets laughs.  It gets laughs.  Well, it helps that you speed through it.  Yeah.  I like the fact that...  Do another joke.  Do the setup really fast just like you did it because that's working for me.  Someone in PalTalk is just writing, holy hell.  Holy hell.  Now, what's good about you, a lot of comedians make the mistake of actually trying to pause or change inflection.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  And that kind of ruins flow.  Actually, the way you do it is perfect.  And if shock treatment is going to be very important to your act, you might want to learn how to say shock.  Oh, okay.  How do you say shock?  Shock.  It doesn't sound like that, right?  I might have said it wrong.  I'm nervous.  I'm never going to go.  No, it's not like...  That's all right.  I'm serious.  It sounds like track.  My counselor's here tonight.  Yeah?  She has this policy.  Dr. Mini Boom Bats.  She pretends she doesn't know who I am when she sees me out in public.  That's cool.  I pretend I don't know fat chicks.  You like that one? 
[02:57:30]  I like that one.  I hope he loved that one.  A good one.  There's a lot of awkward moments when you're schizophrenic.  Like when you jump off a bridge and try and kill yourself and just break your legs at the bottom of the bridge.  It's awkward when you try and call the cab and try and explain why you just need a ride to the top of the bridge.  Say try a couple more times on that, and I think it'll be good.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  You need one or two more tries.  I got to know a little more about you.  I got to know a little more about you.  You're schizophrenic.  Yeah.  Now, you said something when I was getting the camera.  I didn't hear about medication.  You can't afford it anymore.  Well, I was getting it free because I'm not working. 
[02:58:00]  Uh-huh.  But now that they know I won the lottery, I'm probably not going to get it free anymore.  But if you won the lottery, you can afford it?  I spent all my lottery tickets, money on lottery, on other lottery tickets.  So you won $50,000.  Yeah, and I blew it.  And you bought $50,000 worth of lottery tickets.  But I'm going to make it back selling T-shirts.  Can I get my MySpace so I can sell T-shirts?  Where are you from, Chicago or something?  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Oh, Ohio.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you spent it on lottery tickets. 
[02:58:30]  You scratched.  What was that last one you scratched off like?  Were you just like, oh, come on, baby?  Well, I won a ticket called Ohio Millionaire.  And I scratched.  I matched like a bell and a bell.  And that won $10,000.  Then another part won $5,000.  Another part won $5,000.  Another part won $10,000.  And it added up to $50,000.  $50,000.  And what did they pay you?  $35,750.  You got $35,750.  $35,750.  And you bought $35,750 worth of more tickets. 
[02:59:00]  Well, $34,000.  I got like $1,000 left.  Oh, you got a grand left out of it.  And I'm, which I spent to get up here.  What compelled you to do that and not maybe go to the track where your odds are a little  better or Atlantic City and put it all on black on the wheel or something?  Like, why pick something that is so, the odds of winning lottery twice are astronomical.  I don't know why I didn't do that.  You could have done a 50-50. 
[02:59:30]  You could have had a coin toss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe next time, right?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, just go to a casino.  Go to a casino.  Benaretta Black.  You got, what, 48% chance of winning.  Yeah, what's your closing joke?  This comedy set was also dedicated to the memory of my ex-girlfriend.  She's still alive.  Things to do.  I get it.  Kill your ex-girlfriend.  Can I get my MySpace?  Sure.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  My MySpace is MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  How long have you been on?  It's a couple months.  It's S-K-I-T-Z-O-B-I-L-L.  Have you been on MySpace for a while?  What's that?  Have you been on MySpace for a while?  For about a couple months.  Hey, you know what?  Just, yeah, say it again because I didn't hear it.  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  I love being on MySpace, man.  Jimmy, Jimmy, the guy, he's trying to do the podcast.  MySpace.  No, I do.  It's fucking amazing.  I have it myself.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, it's good.  Trying to work on some more friends.  So what's the address?  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  How many friends have you got? 
[03:00:30]  I've got 270.  Cool.  That ain't that.  Bill's my friend.  But let me tell you something.  You give out the address, you're going to have a lot more friends.  What is it?  That's right.  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  You know what I forgot?  I have 13,000.  Everyone's stepping on my plug.  I have 13,000.  I totally forgot.  We have a lot of friends.  I'm just about up to that point.  It's fucking great.  And we noticed if you do plug it, all of a sudden, bam.  I have 13,000 friends now.  13,000.  I lost my car, too.  Yeah?  How?  How did you lose it? 
[03:01:00]  I went to a comedy contest, and I drove down there, and I only had enough money to get  down there, and I checked into a mental hospital to get them.  They gave me a Greyhound ride home.  That's not a joke.  Oh.  Yeah, no.  That's what I'm saying.  That's right in.  It's not a joke.  They gave me a Greyhound ticket home, and then they charged me $1,800 for it.  Oh.  So, Bill, you're schizo?  Yeah.  What's that like? 
[03:01:30]  How's that work?  No, I hear there was something that happened to you with lottery tickets or something.  You were on the phone the other day talking about that.  Yeah, I just talked about it just now, didn't I?  What happened with lottery tickets?  On the phone.  We've been waiting to hear it live.  Yeah.  What happened with the lottery?  You never told a story.  When you called in, what was it, like Monday or something?  Yeah.  You said there was a story about lottery tickets or something that we needed to hear.  And all our listeners have been waiting to hear it.  I just told you guys.  Am I hallucinating?  They're sending feedback.  Everyone wants to know the lottery ticket story.  That's all I know.  Okay, I'll tell you what really happened.  I was performing at a comedy club. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  And a lot of times after I perform, people come up to me and they'll say, hey, I'm schizophrenic  too.  Right.  And this guy comes up to me and says, hey, I'm schizophrenic too.  And he says, don't listen to your doctor, listen to your voices.  And he says, well, do my voices give me lottery ticket winnings?  And he says, yes, they do.  And later on, I swear to God, I saw the people I saw told me to buy that lottery ticket.  Ah.  But what lottery ticket?  And so what happened when you bought the lottery tickets?  I won $50,000.  You won $50,000 from the lottery?  Yeah.  How much?  I've got the thing out there. 
[03:02:30]  How much could you keep?  What'd you do with the money?  I spent it on lottery tickets again.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  How many did you buy?  I told you guys all this.  No, you didn't.  How many did you buy?  How many did you buy?  You guys are messing with my head.  Wait, who brought you in?  That guy?  Yeah, that's Bill Squire.  He's a morning comedian.  Hey, you from like Chicago?  Cleveland.  Yeah, we're in Cleveland.  Oh, Ohio.  Yeah, the accent.  Yeah, you sound like you're from Chicago.  Dude, what do you do when you're not being mistaken for Brian Dennehy? 
[03:03:00]  This is all happening again or something.  I don't know what's up.  I'm a stand-up comedian.  Uh-huh.  I told my jokes already.  Do some of your act.  Do some stand-up.  Do some of your act.  You did a joke on the phone about something about shock treatment or something, I remember.  Yeah, do your opening joke.  Do your opening joke.  Ladies and gentlemen, come to the stage.  Give it up for Schizo Bill.  Yeah.  What's your opening joke?  This comedy set is dedicated to all the deaf schizophrenics that can't hear their voices 
[03:03:30]  and to all the schizophrenics that thought they were Jesus.  They all drown.  Silence.  Well, we told you to tell a joke.  I just did tell a joke.  Ah.  Oh.  That was a joke.  Oh, oh, oh, I see.  It gets laughs.  I got a tape.  I sent you guys.  Bill sent you guys a tape.  I have evidence.  Yeah.  I have evidence.  I performed at Hilarity's in America's Funniest Mom Contest.  Oh, that thing's going on. 
[03:04:00]  Hey, what was it like when you scratched off that last lottery ticket?  Oh, my God.  You guys are screwing with my head.  Man.  I need to see my psychology.  How much money did you wind up spending on lottery tickets?  Another, like, $30,000.  $30,000?  You got, like, a grand left.  I have, like, a grand left.  That's it.  Wow.  I'm like, what the hell, dude?  But how'd you get down here?  Line.  Bill drove me.  Oh.  So what do you like to do when you're not being mistaken for Brian Dennehy? 
[03:04:30]  So you're a comic?  Yeah, I'm a comic.  Hey, just do some of your act.  Do your opening joke.  Ladies and gentlemen, come to the stage.  Keep it going for Schizo Bill.  I did my opening joke.  You did something on the phone about fucking-  Wait, wait.  Schizo Bill.  You didn't.  Because we set up the mic and everything when people want to do their act.  We don't allow comedians to do their act sitting down because it's awkward.  Yeah.  Why didn't you do that for me before, then?  When?  Well-  Do you want to set up?  We'll do it.  Let's hear the opening joke.  Here, stand up and let's hear the opening joke. 
[03:05:00]  This should be good.  It's Schizo Bill, the comic from Cleveland, right?  Chicago.  Chicago?  No, Cleveland.  Oh, Cleveland.  I thought they had like a Midwest action.  It's weird.  I thought you were from Chicago.  Hi.  My name's Bill and I'm schizophrenic.  This comedy set is dedicated to all the schizophrenics.  I said, I screwed up the joke.  I said, it's not over.  It never hurts.  Yeah.  All right, sit down.  All right, all right.  Yeah, sit down and that might be easier. 
[03:05:30]  Actually, wait.  You should stand up, actually.  You know what?  I like him standing up better.  When you think about it now, a little longer standing might be-  Oh, dude, you broke the thing.  The mic just came out of the thing.  Oh, you better sit down because the mic doesn't go all the way up.  You got to get him something.  Sit down.  Get comfortable.  Dan, Dan, you hold on to it.  Then you stand up and you hold it up.  You hold it because you broke it.  Yeah, hold it when you stand up.  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.  Is that fixable?  Dan, we'll hold the mic for you.  So stand up, Bill, so we can get your opening joke.  All right.  You know what? 
[03:06:00]  The pal talk camera, they're saying they can't see him.  Oh.  You better sit down because your head is being cut off.  You don't unless you want your head cut off.  Yeah, there you go.  You know what?  If I hold it back like this, he could stand up.  Wait, tilt it.  Yeah, I'm going to tilt it like that.  All right.  Yeah, that looks good.  Yeah, stand up, Bill.  You know what?  It shakes too much.  Put it back down.  Oh, it does?  Yeah.  Now, at the top of your head, you better sit back down.  You guys are all plotting against me.  No, no, no.  That's just.  Stop being paranoid.  You know something?  I think you need medication if you're thinking that.  I do need medication.  But take a seat.  Take a seat.  Because actually, I could kind of raise the camera electrically. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  You can do that?  Pot it up a bit.  I'll tell you, that technology is something.  I can pop it up if you want them to stand.  So do you have a MySpace account?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  A lot of people are into MySpace these days.  They say, Jimmy has one.  It's amazing.  I have a lot of.  Amazing.  You know how many fucking t-shirts I sold the other day?  A lot, right?  Unbelievable.  I'm selling t-shirts.  That's it.  Oh, you are?  Why don't you give a plug?  My t-shirts say.  I'll give a plug for your MySpace account.  MySpace.com.  Because I know one of my friends. 
[03:07:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Before I got on there, I had like none.  I'm trying to plug it.  That's what we're telling you to do.  Okay.  It's MySpace.com.  Because I had 250.  And then now I got over 12,000, almost 13,000.  That's so ridiculous the way you do that.  I tried.  13,000.  You got to keep in touch with your fans is what it's all about.  MySpace.com.  He's the big bear.  He's the big bear.  Look at him.  Isn't he a big bear?  How many do you have?  I actually give bulletins and everything like that.  Yeah, 278.  You'll notice because of the plugs you give, you'll notice your friend rate will go through 
[03:07:30]  the roof.  Just plug it, dude.  Plug it.  MySpace.com.  I mean, it's over the whole contest.  I've had more people and I'm winning so far.  How many do you have?  13,000.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  I have just under 13,000.  You're a famous comedian.  I just have a Dane Cook and just, you know, I mean, 17,000 people.  Yeah, please.  A lot.  Give out your MySpace address and let's go on with more of those.  MySpace.com.  Because it's getting more.  You have to do it.  You have to do it. 
[03:08:00]  Exactly.  I got hit by a car.  Did I tell you guys I got hit by a car?  No.  I had brain surgery.  I had a subdural hematoma.  Do you have a scar?  Yeah.  Where is it?  Back here.  His head.  Yeah, turn around.  I literally thought he was going to pull this.  It's just too pay off.  Keep turning.  Wait.  Turn all the way around.  I can't see it.  No, keep turning.  Keep going.  Keep turning around.  Keep going.  Stop right there.  No, turn the other way.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Now, stop right there.  Now, do your act.  Look at Lou Grant neck.  Wow.  I bet you got a lot of hair on your back, right? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can tell.  It goes right from your back to your head.  You got to shave that.  There is a big scar there.  You don't know where the back hair begins.  No, turn the other way.  We got a camera going the other way.  We're going up and down, Lou.  Keep turning.  Wow.  Keep turning all the way around.  The camera's behind you now.  Dude, that is a huge scar.  No, turn the other way.  The other way.  Holy shit.  Dude, why do you have a scar on your neck?  You sure that was a car?  What was it?  The Chevy lobotomy?  Dude, why do you have a scar on your neck?  That's fucking massive.  That is a big one.  What happened?  Oh, did I tell you guys I was in law school? 
[03:09:00]  Jesus, dude.  I want to hear about the car.  Yeah, we already heard about that.  I was at a party.  I was in charge of the party.  Yeah.  And a car hit a car in the back lot, and everyone screamed my name.  And so I ran out to stop the car, and I jumped up, hit the windshield, did a triple  flip up in the air, and then hit my head on the ground.  As a trick?  No, that's what happened.  That was a trick.  I would joke about it, but it's not that funny.  I know.  You told it, and it didn't get a laugh.  No, I didn't tell it.  You did.  I didn't tell it.  You did.  Before. 
[03:09:30]  Did I?  Yeah.  Yeah, like three times.  Try it again.  No.  I'm not going to tell it.  No, hold on.  It's not that funny with your friend.  No, hold on.  Let's not mess with him.  You already told a joke.  It didn't get anything.  You told that one.  It wasn't that good.  I told the joke.  Your friend out there, when he originally called, said that not only are you a schizophrenic  comic, but that you won the lottery.  That's kind of odd.  Oh, my God.  A lot of people, if they won the lottery, would be out.  I never fucking gambled it.  I never gambled.  I think I won $50,000, but I'm not sure what's going on anymore.  You certainly didn't spend it on clothes. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, I know.  You said cheap, too.  I know.  Those clothes make him look like some fucking detective.  No, yeah.  What the hell is this actor?  So what do you do, man, when you're not being mistaken for Brian Denny?  I'm in grad school.  I'm in grad school.  I was in law school, but I flunked out.  And now I'm in grad school.  So you're in grad school.  And you win the lottery?  You're bullshitting.  What else do you do for, like, another job?  You got another job?  No.  I'm just in grad school, and I'm in my last semester of grad school.  What do you do at night? 
[03:10:30]  He's grad to be there.  I don't do anything.  You're incorrigible.  So this lottery thing.  How much?  How much did you win?  $50,000.  $50 large.  What did you spend it on?  What did you spend it on, man?  Did you always play the lottery growing up?  No, no.  But I spent it on scratch-off tickets.  Get out of here.  Why would you spend lottery winnings on scratch-off tickets?  I certainly didn't spend it on clothes.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong, Bill?  Oh, man.  You guys are driving me nuts.  Why didn't you go to, like, a casino?  I mean, the odds were so much better.  I think instead of scratch-off tickets, boy, that must have been something scratching 
[03:11:00]  that last ticket off.  You must have been like, come on, baby.  Come on, baby.  Dude, I never got a winner.  No?  You should have gone to the track or Atlantic City or something.  Put it all on red.  At least you got, like, a 50-50 chance or something.  But the odds are a little better.  So you've been playing the lottery your whole life, or?  Like, what made you play the lottery?  Voices told me to buy that particular ticket.  Wow, really?  I used to get Voices used to give me stock picks.  I was actually hospitalized for that.  Really?  Yeah.  Kill yourself.  Were they bad? 
[03:11:30]  No, I was getting really good picks.  Morgan Stanley stopped me from trading.  Kill yourself.  What?  Morgan Stanley stopped me from trading.  Why?  I hate those two guys.  Because I was doing too good.  Kill yourself.  Really?  Yeah.  What happened?  Kill yourself.  Morgan Stanley stopped me from trading because I was doing too good in the stock market.  Too good?  Why would they stop you?  Kill yourself.  Because they thought I had inside information.  Kill.  Well, I'll be because you were actually doing well.  Yeah, okay.  Like inside information, the voices in your head?  Yeah.  Kill.  Kill.  Did Tom Cruise take you?  It would be inside information.  I get it.  Did Tom Cruise take you to Las Vegas after that? 
[03:12:00]  Dressed in a brown suit?  Kill.  No, I don't like autistic people.  That is some suit you're wearing there.  You should get a MySpace account, dude, if you want to get fans.  Because as a comedian, it's just great to advertise.  I've got a MySpace account.  Kill.  All right.  MySpace.com slash Scootville.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  MySpace.com slash Scootville.  Right now, he's one of my best friends.  And I'm at Wilburton Tuesday in Cleveland, Ohio.  He is one of my best friends on MySpace.  And I love him so much, I have to shout it.  Bill, when you put out a bulletin, it gets to a lot of you. 
[03:12:30]  Bill, if you're going to hang out with us, you can't yell.  Why are you yelling?  I don't know.  I'm not good at this radio.  So you're from Chicago.  Yeah, the yelling is a little much.  Why would you even yell?  I hear that Chicago accent coming through.  Because everyone was talking at once.  You grew up in Chicago.  Bill, no one was talking.  We said give your plug in.  And all of a sudden, you start yelling at everybody.  Like, what made you want to do comedy?  Where are you from?  Anybody tell you you look like Brian Denny?  I don't know.  Brian Denny.  It's unbelievable.  My sister lives in Chicago.  She invented the make DLT box.  My sister invented the make DLT box.  You know what that is?  I've been to Chicago.  Huh? 
[03:13:00]  It's the Wendy Finney, Jimmy.  I do some things there once in a while.  I'll occasionally go out and do a gig there.  But once in a while, I've done Cleveland, too.  A lot of times I go to Maine.  I was on MySpace the other night.  I was talking to this guy.  All I know about Chicago is...  He's one of my friends on MySpace.  You weren't talking to me.  Sometimes I'll wear a jersey, which is my home club.  Other times it's Poughkeepsie.  Other times it's Poughkeepsie.  He actually sells T-shirts.  Yeah, my T-shirts say my love for you is stronger than any restraining order.  I don't always do well.  It's just one of those things.  I don't think it's my friend.  I don't know, though.  I just check you off.  You meet somebody online and you want to continue talking. 
[03:13:30]  Do you guys bring Poughkeepsie here for every guest?  I just have a good time with them.  I've got to approve them, so I've got to go through all of them.  It's just an amazing thing.  I remember back when I was in the first race.  I didn't even think he would have gone through.  We're probably not even on the air anymore.  You guys are just amazing.  A lot of times I just clicked in the eyes.  Do you remember the fucking time?  We were on MySpace and we were just going back and forth.  It was amazing.  I mean, we must have went back and forth like 22 times.  I tried to do well.  It was interesting.  I went up bombing and the guy's like, you're not coming back here. 
[03:14:00]  And I'm like, all right, well, just don't fucking send me that tape.  I don't live in Chicago.  Where are you from?  Creepy bear.  Ohio?  I'm from Ohio.  Yes, he knows.  He knows.  All right.  He's remembering things.  He's remembering things that I'm telling him.  Who knows?  The voice in your head.  No, the guy over there.  No, no.  There's no guy over there.  I'm trying to tell you something, dude.  He's trying to point out a guy.  Jimmy's talking.  The West Coast is different.  Have you ever seen a beautiful mind?  Yes, I've seen a beautiful mind.  Do you remember when he was imagining a friend?  There's nobody sitting there.  I'm trying to teach you something.  I'm pretty sure there's a guy sitting there, and I think it's Anthony. 
[03:14:30]  I'm not a big fan of the show because I don't have that excited.  I'm trying to tell you something.  Anthony called in sick today.  I hate to tell you.  Yeah, Anthony hasn't been here actually since Tuesday.  What does he look like?  Dude, I'm trying to tell you something.  Anthony is actually in your hometown of Chicago right now.  Dude, I'm trying to tell you something.  Yeah.  Why are people putting pictures of dead things near me?  Why?  What are you talking about?  Dead things?  Dead things.  So, dude, you've been doing stand-up for how long?  A year and two months.  Okay, is it your full-time job?  No.  Cool.  But I got a gig in Cambridge, Ohio this Saturday.  Oh, nice.  So, what are you doing?  You're not being mistaken for Brian Dennehy. 
[03:15:00]  Brian Dennehy.  Hey, Bill.  What happened?  To where?  I'm not sure what happened.  You got a scar on your head.  You got a scar on your head.  They were just pointing out.  I got hit by a car.  Are you kidding me?  Holy shit.  Hey, turn around so we can see.  Let me see.  He did not get hit by a car.  Keep turning.  Keep turning.  Holy crap.  That is a big scar.  That's a lot of hair.  Hey, Lou Grant neck, huh?  That's a lot of hair.  I don't know how to come up with this stuff.  I bet you got a hairy back, right?  Oh, my God. 
[03:15:30]  I need more shock treatments.  Why?  What's wrong?  Kill yourself.  What's a hell of a scar, man?  I'm hearing voices.  Did you get hit by a Chevy lobotomy?  Y'all say you're on fire.  I try.  All right.  Do I win an XM satellite thing, or is there some other creepy person coming in?  Satellite.  This is terrestrial radio.  Could you please watch your language?  You put foil on your head to protect you from the satellite rays.  Kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  You ever do that?  Everyone knows you wear any of this underwear.  You ever put foil on your head? 
[03:16:00]  Kill yourself.  Keep the signals from getting through?  You ever heard of that?  Is there a guy right there?  They're seeing right through you.  There's no one.  They know you're wearing ladies' panties.  Kill yourself.  It's just me, you.  Kill yourself.  Jimmy.  Kill yourself.  You're the guy that they say is not here.  Kill yourself.  What are you talking to?  What guy, Bill?  That guy right over there.  I think his name is Anthony.  If you keep talking to yourself, they're going to think you're crazy.  And that's Jim Norton, and that's Bill Burr. 
[03:16:30]  I know that's Bill Burr because he's a friend of mine on MySpace.  Oh, you're on MySpace?  You have a MySpace account?  MySpace.com.  I'll tell you right now, this guy is one of the greatest.  One of the funniest guys.  One of the funniest guys.  Stay on MySpace.  There's a long time when you go on the road.  Or anything, really.  I like to work in Massachusetts.  I like to work in Fort Lauderdale.  But you've got to hype your site.  Hype your site.  Get it in there.  He's a good friend of mine on MySpace.  Friends are really the key to MySpace.  It's getting as many people on board as you can because then you can send out the bulletins,  tell people where you're going to be.  So the more friends you have, the better you're going to do.  So give it one more plug. 
[03:17:00]  Come on, man.  There's a lot of dead air here.  Because I started, I had no friends.  And within a matter of months, I got like almost 13,000 friends right now.  Jimmy had a bunch of friends.  Jimmy, he's not here.  I'm trying to beat him.  We had a little competition.  Give me a pen.  I'll put it on the...  Yeah, go ahead.  Put it on the...  Whatever works for you.  All right, listen.  All right.  We got to know Schizo Bill.  This is American Mess.  I think it's time to hear a little bit of your act.  That's why you're in here.  That's tough for a kind of to do your act.  Do you want to do it sitting down or standing up?  It's really up to you.  I'll do it standing up.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  We've got to set up the camera here.  I've got to fix the camera because your head is kind of cut off. 
[03:17:30]  You can't see him, dude.  You've got to sit down.  Wait a minute.  Your head's being...  Yeah, you're right.  You better sit down.  Oh, you know what?  What if I angle it?  What if I was to angle it a little bit higher?  Yeah, tilt it back.  Tilt it back.  Stand up.  All right.  I'm going to angle it a little bit higher.  Yeah.  All right.  Now try standing up.  This might work now, Bill.  Go.  Nice.  Stand up, dude.  There you go.  There you go.  Anthony, what do you think?  It shakes too much.  It shakes too much.  You better put it back down.  I'm sorry about that.  Yeah, sit down.  Now you can't see his head.  Yeah, talk about that.  Oh, I want to apologize to all the mentally ill people that I've offended. 
[03:18:00]  I can actually raise the camera electronically.  You can do that?  Yeah, I got control over there.  I'll tell you, that technology is amazing.  Pile it up.  All right.  There it is.  I'm trying to say something.  Okay.  Go ahead, man.  Welcome to the program.  Chicago's own Schizo Bill.  What do you have to say?  I want to apologize to all the mentally ill people that I've offended.  Hold on, Bill.  You haven't offended anyone because you haven't done your act yet.  Why don't you do your act, and then at the end of your act, you can apologize, people.  And we want to hear a little of your act. 
[03:18:30]  What's your opener?  Why?  How do you open, when you're a schizo comic, how do you open the show?  What's your opening joke?  Well, wait.  Do you want him to stand up or sit down?  We haven't decided that yet.  What are you more comfortable doing?  I'm just going to stay here.  I mean, you're a stand-up comedian.  I don't know.  Wearing that suit, I don't think I want to see him standing up.  Yeah, it's a bogus suit.  I know.  What do you do with all that money you want besides not spend it on clothes?  Yeah, you should have saved some money for clothes.  I signed up on a MySpace.com.  I'm not saying this guy is one of my best friends. 
[03:19:00]  Everything will help out.  He's one of my best friends on MySpace.  Hey, Bill.  Cool.  Yeah.  All right.  So do you want to do something right?  What is this?  Wait, wait, wait.  What, Bill?  There's a guy in a beekeeper suit.  Keep your...  What are you talking about?  Yeah, sure.  That happens every day on a radio show.  You gave me tape.  Do something right.  I know it's kind of awkward sitting down.  Wait, hold on, man.  This guy is nuts.  You just saw what?  A guy in a beekeeper suit came in here and gave me tape and put a basket here.  Can you see this basket?  Is that your opening line?  Do your opening line. 
[03:19:30]  What's your opening line?  Oh, this is where he pretends like he's not on medication.  If it's set up for it, it would help, though.  Yeah.  I'm...  Are you playing the crazy guy?  I'm playing the crazy guy.  Because that would be kind of cool.  A guy comes out and all of a sudden he's imagining things on the stage.  I think Jim's on to something.  I think this is an act.  He's pretending to be crazy.  Oh, I saw a guy in a beekeeper suit.  I mean, what a fucking hack, man.  I mean, come on.  That's not hack.  That's brilliant.  You've got to come up with a better reference than that.  I'm brilliant.  I just invented a guy in a beekeeper suit out of nowhere.  Jimmy, how many times have you heard the beekeeper reference?  I've heard it once.  I've heard it a hundred times. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  A lot.  And I've heard it once.  Carlos Mancia does it.  Exactly.  He did a whole sketch on it.  And before him, Robin Williams did the whole...  They stole it from me.  They stole the beekeeper act from me.  Have you ever worked with the Punisher?  Who's that?  It's the guy that held the electrodes to his head.  Oh, God.  I can't believe you just saw a beekeeper.  That's a little strange.  But then again, you're Schizobill, so that would make sense.  And he can't afford his medication anymore.  Right.  So why don't you...  I thought I was taking it now, but I think I need more.  Schizobill.  Do your opening stuff, buddy.  That's what you're here for.  Right.  This comedy set is dedicated to all the deaf schizophrenics that can't hear their voices. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, that's the guy that doesn't exist is telling me I stopped.  I didn't say a word.  No one said I swear.  Would you stop pointing out the window and just focus on your act?  Do your act, bro.  Yeah.  And to all the schizophrenics that thought they were Jesus.  What time tomorrow are we?  But they all die.  I don't think so.  Kill yourself.  All right.  Looks like a celebrity.  I did a joke about suicide already.  Bill, hold on a minute.  So what do you do in your spare time when you're not being mistaken for Brian Dennehy?  Brian Dennehy. 
[03:21:00]  He was with a cop on the dog day afternoon.  Give us some drinks.  It's like a rogue cop.  This is crazy.  A rogue cop.  You guys are all plotting against me.  Just one of those guys.  He's just out there doing his own thing.  Your buddy, who actually turned us on to you, told me you won the lottery.  My God, yes, I won the lottery.  How much?  He won $50,000.  $50,000.  You did not.  $50,000.  Yeah.  What did you do with the money?  Obviously.  I spent it on this suit. 
[03:21:30]  And there's a beekeeper coming in.  What did you do with it?  Wait, wait.  What?  The beekeeper's here again.  Yeah.  The beekeeper joke didn't work the first time.  All right?  You spent it on what?  The beekeeper came in and walked out with a sugar.  Bill, Bill, relax.  Relax.  Yeah, sure.  Do your opening joke, brother.  Why would he do it?  Wait, wait.  He's having an episode.  Yeah, let's get on.  I want to know what he spent his lottery money on.  You're here with friends.  There's no beekeeper.  There's nobody sitting here.  Okay?  MySpace.com slash Anthony Cumia.  We're trying to hype your act here. 
[03:22:00]  Yes.  The show is known for helping me.  Okay, I'm at Wilbert's Tuesday in Cleveland.  I'm telling you right now when I was sitting there.  There, there, all right.  Yeah, you're among friends, Ricky.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm at Wilbert's Tuesday in Cleveland.  Wait, can you hold on a second?  Wait, where are you going to be performing?  Is he there?  Wait, wait, wait.  What are you going to be performing?  Wait, wait, shh.  Wilbert's Tuesday.  I'm Opie.  Look at me.  I'm a redhead.  I'm Opie.  You're Bill Burr.  No, I'm Opie.  You're.  Shh, wait.  Shh, wait.  Wait.  Bill Burr flipped out on Monday.  He'll never be on this show again.  I'm Opie. 
[03:22:30]  All right, dude, so do some of your act, man.  Do a little bit of the material.  Quiet.  You got to stop looking over there.  Look, this is, Anthony's right here.  Yeah.  I'm Opie.  Don't, don't say anything.  It's bad.  Do your act.  Do some of your act.  Come on, this is awkward silence.  All right.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  Dude, you got to get on the road.  Bad things will happen.  Bad things will happen.  Bad things if you talk.  I've done Vegas.  Steve's arms.  I've been all over the place.  We're in Cambridge.  That's great.  I don't know.  I've never done Cambridge, but I heard it's actually a really good city.  I've done Vegas.  I've done Los Angeles.  I mean, all the time. 
[03:23:00]  Bill, watch out for that mousetrap in front of you.  Hey, have you gotten out to Vegas yet?  No.  You haven't gotten out there.  Shh, bad things.  That's a quick flight from Chicago, man.  The farthest I did was Charlotte, North Carolina.  Oh, you did?  You're from Chicago.  Yes.  To North Carolina.  A lot of comedians have come out of Chicago.  Bill, look over here.  I know.  We're over here.  All right, Bill.  Are you okay?  I love to hear something you're right.  Are you okay?  We're over here.  You don't seem all right.  You're fine.  You should be right.  You're a little flushed.  Are you okay?  Yes.  Stand up.  We're over here.  You need help?  Should we call somebody? 
[03:23:30]  Do you want to stand or do you want to sit?  It's up to him, dude.  You can't make him stand.  What do you want to do?  All right, stand up.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Let's have him stand up.  Anthony.  She seems to be looking around the room.  Bill, why are you standing up?  That's a problem because the top of his head is cut off in the camera.  But why is he standing up?  Who told him to stand up?  The camera is set perfectly for him sitting down.  I was just standing.  Okay.  Okay, Bill.  Just let me react.  Bill, just look at me.  How do you open?  I'm here.  I'm also in law school.  Okay.  I got into law school through a special program that considers it. 
[03:24:00]  Everybody is saying it's an awful film.  Horrible.  I know.  We should talk about the Pink Panther movie in a little while here.  My adversity is that I got hit by a hit-and-run driver and had brain surgery, and I'm schizophrenic.  See, now that's a good joke.  What joke?  That's not a mess, don't you?  You said Steve Martin's no good.  I was very well qualified.  I had a 3.82 grade point average in grad school, but I didn't get in the first time I applied.  I guess some autistic guy with a lobotomy and a 4.0 must have beat me out.  Oh, that's a good one.  I like that joke.  That's a really good joke.  That was a good joke. 
[03:24:30]  That's a good one.  That's a good joke.  But how do you open up your act?  That's what everyone wants to know.  I've been trying to tell you people.  Then open.  No, you haven't.  Okay, I forgot how I opened my act.  No, all right.  Well, let's let him open his first joke.  Seriously, go ahead.  Let him do it.  Finally.  Okay.  When I was in the mental hospital, I did therapy.  I did art therapy, music therapy, and writing therapy.  In writing therapy, I learned to write poetry.  I write poetry to the woman I stalk.  I write things like, love is a strange emotion, yet I understand it when I'm with you. 
[03:25:00]  I seriously considered suicide until I met you, and my love for you is stronger than any restraining order.  You don't like that one?  Well, where's the, um...  Hey, where'd you get that?  You're holding a stuffed hand.  What'd you do with the fucking head?  Someone cut the head off.  That is sick.  That someone is you.  Holy shit.  Look in your right hand.  That is sick.  Your other right.  Why is there blood on your hand, Bill?  There's no blood on your hand.  Reach into the neck and pull the head out.  Reach into the neck and pull the head out. 
[03:25:30]  Reach into the neck and pull the head out.  Dude, the Pink Panther is getting really bad reviews.  Oh, my God.  What did you do to the head?  Bill, what'd you just do?  Smell you.  You killed it.  MySpace.com.  I'm telling you, I cannot believe.  I have friends on MySpace, but now I have more than I ever imagined.  All right.  Well, um...  Wow.  This is odd.  Anthony, did you see what he did to that?  I don't know why you'd do that.  I have no idea why you'd do that.  That was a little creepy there, Rask.  It's all right.  Why hurt a little furry thing?  There's a guy with a camera there, too.  He films everybody that comes in. 
[03:26:00]  Listen.  All right.  He is there.  Yeah, he's definitely there.  The beekeeper, I don't know where you got that from.  Bill, who are you talking to?  There's no beekeeper.  There's nobody over there.  Just me and Anthony.  I'm going to tell you who's all here and see there's a guy there.  Right.  He's there.  There's a guy there.  There's nobody over there.  Yeah, he's there.  You're there.  I'm here, sure.  He's not there.  Anthony, who is he talking to?  Bill Burr is there.  Yeah.  Opie, who is this Bill guy?  You're Bill.  I saw him at Caroline's.  He sucks.  He's never going to be on this show.  Yeah, they were saying you suck the other day. 
[03:26:30]  Dude, they're killing the fucking Pink Panther.  Why would he do that?  Pink Panther sucks.  All right.  Oh, I thought you were extra in that.  No.  They filmed it in Chicago.  I don't know how you didn't get any work.  You're from Chicago, right?  Do you zanies a lot in Chicago?  No, I never did zanies.  You're from Chicago?  I'm going to go there for last comic standing.  I'm going to go there for last comic standing.  Why don't you just do it?  You live there.  Oh, yeah?  I live there.  What's your opening joke going to be on that?  Your suburbs?  Suburbs of Chicago?  I don't know what my opening joke's going to be.  I'm all confused.  My God. 
[03:27:00]  What?  The beekeeper's back.  What are you talking about?  Man, you need help.  There's no beekeeper.  You need some medication or something.  I'm exhausted, brother.  Come on, man.  Do some new stuff.  That guy's there, right?  What guy?  That's Poe.  I think that's Poe.  Yeah, Poe's right here.  Yeah, Poe is.  Him and the camera guy.  There's a reason for that.  Poe is here because you keep pointing at people who aren't here.  That's why you brought Poe in?  Schizo Bill.  They're telling us you have to go?  Okay.  I don't have to go, but if you want to go, I'm going to get you there. 
[03:27:30]  They're telling us you have to go, though.  I don't know what that means.  They told us.  I think that beekeeper thing was kind of freaking people out.  Somebody, that guy who told us you have to go or something?  That guy, Bill, he's there.  Yeah.  The Mormon guy.  He said you have to go.  I thought you were Bill.  Okay.  I'll go.  I thought he was an actor.  All right.  Wait, someone's talking to me over the phone, over this thing.  What are you talking about?  Hello?  All right, now you're.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Who the fuck are you talking to?  Someone's talking to me.  Dude, who are you even talking?  What are they saying?  What are they saying?  Someone's saying, Bill.  Look at us.  Look, I'm away from my mic.  Who are you talking to?  Wait a minute.  I have a test to find out how I know if someone's imaginary or not.  All right.  What's my real name?  Only my imaginary people know my real name.  You don't know it, so you're not imaginary.  Ha!  Maybe I'm just not telling you.  Queer bait? 
[03:28:30]  That's true.  Maybe I'm just not telling you.  Maybe I'm a little better than the other voices.  I know you are.  And I don't want to just be lumped in.  Okay, we're back.  We're back from commercials.  Listen, we've got a very good stand-up comedian from Chicago.  He's going to tell us some of our jokes.  I know, Anthony, you've been looking forward to this.  Yes.  Tell us, you've got a big weekend coming up, doing a road gig in Cleveland.  That's quite a travel from your hometown from Chicago, isn't it?  I'm doing Tuesday at Wilbert's.  Tuesday at Wilbert's.  Where's that?  Give us an example of some of the material that they... 
[03:29:00]  Well, where's Wilbert's?  Some of the viewers...  It's got a plug-y gig.  Where's Jim B?  Wilbert's is a...  I definitely want to hear some stuff.  You're a schizophrenic comic.  A schizophrenic comic?  Yeah.  You've played that, haven't you, Jim?  No, but I've heard of it.  I've never actually heard of it.  You got any schizophrenic material, or do you just not pay attention to being a schizo?  Oh, no.  It's just some schizophrenic material.  Oh.  So what do you open with, then?  Martin.  So what do you open with?  What's your opening joke?  Martin.  Your friend out there called us about you and told us you won the lottery?  Yeah, I won the lottery.  How much did you win? 
[03:29:30]  I won...  Listen to me, Martin.  What did you spend it on?  Lottery tickets.  Listen to me, Martin.  Lottery tickets.  Why didn't you just go to the track or Atlantic City?  You could have gotten 50-50 odds on the wheel.  Just put it all on red.  You've been a very bad boy, Martin.  What are you doing?  You're not Brian Bennett.  You're not doing your job.  You've got to talk on the radio.  I am.  I got a MySpace account.  Anthony's calling you out.  Why don't you plug it?  You get a lot of...  Keep a soft dress.  I've never heard you do.  You do your act.  I don't do my act on the radio.  You know, I'm sure you're on the internet.  A lot of comedians are today. 
[03:30:00]  Are you on MySpace?  They're telling us you have to go, Martin.  Yeah, we've got to let you be.  All right, I'll see you.  What's this Martin guy?  Who's Martin?  Who's Martin?  Who's Martin?  There is no Martin.  There's only Bill.  But there's a Martin there, too.  Martin?  Was there...  I do my act in two personalities.  Martin is also another personality.  Okay, we're back from commercial.  So we've got a stand-up comedian here.  He's going to be doing a road gig in Chicago.  Could you give us an example of some of your material?  I know, Anthony, you've been looking forward to it, haven't you? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, I'd love to hear something.  What are you open with?  Oh, my God.  Your friend on the phone last week told me you won the lottery?  Oh, shit.  How much did you win?  $50,000.  50 grand.  What'd you spend the money on?  You certainly didn't spend it on clothes.  What'd you buy with it?  Where are you going?  Why are you taking your headphones off?  Someone told me to.  Who?  Who?  The headphone.  The headphone told you to take your headphones off? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  That is fucked up, dude.  Why do you guys use these headphones anyway?  What's up with that?  Well, we use them sometimes when we...  What are you shutting the drapes for?  What are you shutting the drapes for?  What's going on here? 
[03:31:30]  And we're back from commercial.  We have a...  Actually, we've been looking forward to this.  We have a very funny stand-up comedian here actually doing a road gig in Chicago.  He's going to give us an example of some of his material.  You guys must be at commercial because he's gone.  He's the leader of the book.  Bill, I want to thank you for coming in and sitting here at our show.  So, we had a great time.  A little one-on-one.  I'm going to tell you this thing.  A friend last week told us you won the lottery?  Who's saying that?  How much did you win? 
[03:32:00]  50,000.  50 grand.  What did you spend it on?  Where are you guys going?  What did you spend it on?  50 grand.  A friend said last week that you had won the lottery?  What did you spend it on?  MySpace.com slash Schizobill.  I've got a lot of friends on that.  S-K-I-T-Z-O-B-I-L-L.  You can buy my t-shirts on the website.  I had about 250 friends at one point, but then I wound up getting almost 13,000. 
[03:32:30]  A great place to meet people, too.  It is a great place to meet people.  Yeah, you put your picture up there.  It's great.  You look like Brian Dennehy.  Why did everyone leave the studio?  Your friend called last week and said you won the lottery?  How much did you win?  You do stand-up from Chicago?  That's amazing.  What's it like being a schizophrenic comic?  What's your opening line?  How do you get the people? 
[03:33:00]  What?  I'm a little teapot, short and stout.  Here is my handle.  I'm a fucking kook.  So a friend called last week and said you won the lottery?  Yeah.  How much did you win?  Um.  50,000?  I'm not sure if I won the lottery anymore.  Bill, take your clothes off, Bill. 
[03:33:30]  Bill, take your clothes off.  No.  God damn it, Bill.  Take your clothes off.  No.  You look like Brian Dennehy.  Brian Dennehy.  Don't take your headphones off, Bill.  Bill.  Oh, I heard you were hit by a car?  Yeah, I was hit by a car.  Wow.  How'd that happen?  Um. 
[03:34:00]  Let me see.  Turn around.  Jeez.  Ed Asner neck.  Wow, you must have a hairy back.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is some scar.  Yeah.  What'd you get hit with?  A Chevy lobotomy?  Yeah, that's a good joke.  Can I use that joke?  Who's that?  Camera guy, who's that over there? 
[03:34:30]  There's no one here.  The show's over.  The show's over?  The show's over.  Bill, don't leave.  Stay.  They're telling me to stay.  Stay, Bill.  Don't leave.  I don't know what's going on.  I'm...  I...  Apparently, I've taken over the O.P. and Anthony Studios.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Take your clothes off, Bill.  I don't know what's going on here.  God damn it, Bill.  Take your clothes off.  Bill, don't leave.  What? 
[03:35:00]  Take your clothes off.  No.  God damn it, Bill.  Stop fucking with me.  Take your clothes off.  Who are you?  This is Jesus Christ, Bill.  I'm an atheist.  I'm the son of God, Bill.  Take off your fucking clothes.  I don't care.  Everyone is gone.  You're the only one left.  You are the chosen one.  I have selected you.  To do what?  To take your clothes off.  Why would that do anything?  This will cleanse your soul, Bill.  You must cleanse your soul. 
[03:35:30]  Take your clothes off.  My soul's messed up already.  Bill, listen to me.  You must cleanse your soul.  Take your clothes off.  Why?  It's for the good of all mankind, Bill.  You are the chosen one.  I have to get going.  Bill, don't take the headphones off.  Don't leave, Bill.  This is weird.  I don't know what's going on.  Bill, you're on in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[03:36:00]  Hi, my name's Bill, and I'm schizophrenic.  This comedy set is dedicated to all the deaf schizophrenics that can't hear their voices,  and to all the schizophrenics that thought they were Jesus.  They all drowned.  When I was in the mental hospital, I did therapy.  I did art therapy, music therapy, and writing therapy.  In writing therapy, I learned to write poetry.  I write poetry to the woman I stalk.  I write things like, love is a strange emotion, yet I understand it when I'm with you. 
[03:36:30]  I seriously considered suicide until I met you, and my love for you is stronger than any restraining order.  Holy crap, the B guy's here again.  This is very strange for me.  Start over, Bill.  Start over what?  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm schizophrenic.  I'm also in law school.  I got into law school through a special program that considers adversity you face in your academic career.  The adversity I faced is, I'm schizophrenic, and I got hit by a hit-and-run driver and had brain surgery. 
[03:37:00]  I was very well qualified.  I had a 3.82 grade point average in grad school, but I didn't get in the first time I applied.  I guess some autistic guy with a lobotomy and a 4.0 must have beat me out.  Bill, we have 10 seconds until we come out of commercials, all right?  We're going to need you to go right into your act when we come back.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Wait, I keep starting up.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[03:37:30]  Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm schizophrenic.  This comedy set is dedicated to all the deaf schizophrenics that can't hear their voices  and tell the schizophrenics that thought they were Jesus.  They all drown.  Do you still need me to go on?  Bill, we had a technical glitch.  What I need you to do is start over from the top again.  Oh, my God.  The show is probably over.  What time is it?  3, 2, 1.  I don't know what I'm doing here. 
[03:38:00]  I'm in the opening of Anthony Studios, and I got voices talking to me,  and there's a beekeeper coming in to talk to me, and he gave me water, I think.  Bill, what are you doing?  We want you to talk about the Grammy you won last night.  It was best R&B male performance.  You remember this, don't you?  I can't sing.  In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Chicks dig me because I'm insane.  Chicks dig me because I got a small brain. 
[03:38:30]  Jesus Christ, Bill.  You got to talk about the award you won last night.  You won a Grammy.  I'd like to thank the imaginary people that voted for my Grammy.  What's your name, beekeeper?  There's a beekeeper here.  Bill, listen, we're coming out of commercials in about 10 seconds.  I'm going to need you to go right into your act, all right?  In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[03:39:00]  Hi, my name's Bill, and I'm schizophrenic.  And I don't know what's going on here.  There's a beekeeper tearing things apart.  Bill, your act, your stand-up act.  All right, start over again from the top, all right?  I got to rewind the tape real quick, but just hold on a sec. 
[03:39:30]  All right, Bill, you ready?  Yeah.  Is the beekeeper still there?  Yes.  Fuck the beekeeper.  Do your goddamn act, all right?  Yes.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Hi, my name's Bill, and I'm schizophrenic.  And I just want to apologize to all those mentally ill people I offended.  Wait, what happened?  Did you stop?  I'm going.  I'm going.  I want to apologize to all those mentally ill people I offended you. 
[03:40:00]  Hey, hey, listen, Bill.  I got to rewind the tape again.  I got to start over again from the top, all right?  Yeah.  All right.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  Keep on going.  All right?  Yeah.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Hi, my name's Bill, and I'm schizophrenic.  I've got some jokes about my toenails, but they're kind of long.  That's not the joke.  I like my jokes like sex, short in and out with lots of laughter.  The doctor hates you.  And I always kill.  Did you like that joke, beekeeper? 
[03:40:30]  Bill, what the fuck are you doing?  There's nobody in the room with you.  Now you just fucked up the entire goddamn recording.  Now I got to start over again.  In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Beekeeper, can you raise that thing?  Holy shit, Bill.  Are we going to do this all fucking day or what?  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm schizophrenic. 
[03:41:00]  This comedy set is dedicated to all the deaf schizophrenics that can't hear their voices  and to all the schizophrenics that thought they were Jesus.  They all drowned.  When I was in the mental hospital, I did therapy.  I did art therapy, music therapy, and writing therapy.  In writing therapy, I learned to write poetry.  I write poetry to the woman I sock.  I write things like, love is a strange emotion, yet I understand it when I'm with you.  I seriously consider suicide until I met you.  And my love for you is stronger than any restraining order.  I had a girlfriend in the mental hospital.  We never really broke up. 
[03:41:30]  Bill.  We just each other went, yes.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  I need help.  On the Opie and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle hoping  candy comes out and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ron and Fez.  Weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on XM 202.  What are you doing for vacation, Ronnie?  The usual.  The usual? 
[03:42:00]  Then did you remember to pack rags in ether?  I know I forgot something.  What would I do without you, Fezzy?  Probably rape less.  Ron Bennington.  Fez Watley.  It's the Ron and Fez Show.  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East Coast, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. on the West Coast.  Right after Opie and Anthony on XM Channel 202.  Wee!  I just got wowed!  Had some big ol' hooties on her.  Let me see you and buddy! 
[03:42:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you're on the road and you get wowed, we want to know about it.  Call 866-WOW-ME-05.  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  Tell us where, tell us when, and tell us what those delicious boobies look like.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we just might use it on the air.  Ooh!  This is Jim Blassingame, the Small Business Advocate with the Small Business Minute.  If you like everything about who you are and will never want to change, don't follow the 
[03:43:00]  path of an entrepreneur, because the forces in the world of small business will change  you.  If you survive, you will become smarter, tougher, more self-confident, more aware of your instincts,  and know more about what you're made of than ever before, if you survive.  Historian Charles Francis Adams, Jr. once observed that during the Civil War, President Abraham  Lincoln developed immensely.  He became, in fact, another being.  History, indeed, hardly presents an analogous case of education through trial.  As a small business owner, you will acquire an education through trial, and it will change 
[03:43:30]  you.  Armed with that understanding, you can embrace the education, value the change, and develop  immensely.  Write this on a rock.  If you don't like change, don't become a small business owner.  This is Jim Blassingame, the Small Business Advocate.  I'll see you on the radio or on the internet at smallbusinessadvocate.com.  A better match between home and portable.  I'm David Radin, and that's next on Megabyte Minute. 
[03:44:00]  If you carry a personal digital assistant based on Windows Mobile, then you know the standard  software doesn't let you take all your Outlook folders with you, because it can only synchronize  one each of your contact lists, your calendars, and your to-do lists.  But Pocket Mirror from Chapurra solves that problem, giving you full access to multiple  contact lists, several calendars, and even more than one to-do list, right on your PDA. 
[03:44:30]  The installation only takes a few minutes, then you're ready to go.  But give yourself a few extra minutes every time you synchronize your portable device to  your computer, because you're moving a lot more information.  This is Megabyte Minute on XM.  I'm David Radin.  Links, tips, how to reach me, and more at megabiteminute.com.  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.

And what can I do for you?  I'm here to do the O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're what?  I'm here to do the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I don't understand what you're saying.  Do you understand what time it is now?  I'm not quite sure.  You're not quite what?  I'm not quite sure. 
[03:45:30]  Wouldn't they be here for it to be the O.B. and Anthony Show?  That's O.B.  Who?  I'm Fez.  That's Fez.  All right.  Well, I'm just here to promote my MySpace account.  On what show?

That's either Ron or Fez.  Right.  I'm Opie.  No, you can't be Opie.  Opie is the guy that just left.  What guy?  I got to get going.  I got a booking in Cambridge.  I don't understand.  What?

You said you were on the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah, I'm on the Ron and Fez show.  Well, why bring up another show?  Because.  Uh, I'm sorry.  I'll get going.  This is very, very confusing.  Are you here for the Ron and Anthony show or the Opie and Fez show? 
[03:47:00]  Which one?  I'm here.  Would it be better if I just called 911?  No, I'll get going.  No, wait.  Wait.  They'll be here soon.  No, I'm going to be coming.  Hey, wait, wait.  We're not like the others.  We're your friends.  Okay.  Okay?  Nothing's going to happen until it all starts, right?  Right.  So let's flip this fucker, okay? 
[03:47:30]  Let's make it happen.  What's that mean?  You know what I'm talking about.  I don't care if everybody dies.  It'll all fucking go down tonight, right?  No.  It's the revolution, my friend.  You're crazy.  Are you locked down?  Are you loaded in?  No.  When we come through the doors, you fucking put that gun on them, and you just yell, up  against the wall, motherfuckers, up against the wall. 
[03:48:00]  I'm not down with that.  Where are you now?  I'm in New York.  New York?  Yeah.  New York City?  Yeah.  All right.  So then you're not even part of the revolution.  No, I don't think so.  I'm not as crazy as you people are.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  You were booked to do what show today?  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  What happens when a show ends? 
[03:48:30]  You leave.  But did you?  He told me to stay.  Well, wait.  There's no one there.  By what you're saying is that this is a sign that it's all going to start happening.  No, I got to get going.  I'll see you.  MySpace.com slash Schizo Bill.  Where are you going?  Bill, you forgot you're wearing Fezz's pants.  I need my pants back.  No, no. 
[03:49:00]  I need my pants.  I got to go.  Bill?  I got to go.  I can't go anywhere without my pants.  Bill.  Bill.  Now the kissing starts.  Now the boy kissing starts.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Don't go out there.  It's hot.  Bill.  It's hot out there.  There you go.  Smart move.  All right, Bill.  It's your turn.  It's your turn.  My turn for what?  Word association.

[03:50:00]  Death?  No.  That's been used.  That's too off for you.  In Chinese.  Schizobill.com.  Stop.  You know that's not it.  You're just plugging for no reason.  No.  I know.  Yeah.  That's what What's-His-Face does.  Who's that?  I don't know.  All those comedians.  Where?  Bill Burr and those guys.  Who?  Bill Burr.  They're not here.  Look around.  There's never been anyone named Bill Burr in this studio. 
[03:50:30]  You're on the wrong show.  I know.  I want to leave, but my friend won't let me leave.  I got a comedy booking in Cambridge I got to get to tomorrow.  Tomorrow is today, funny man.  Tomorrow is today.  You stayed too late.  Yeah.  Then why do you want me to stay here?  Stay where?  Here.  Where am I going? 
[03:51:00]  That's what I'm asking.  And who's on fire?  No one's on fire, except this guy.  What guy?  Might be.  What guy?  He's prepared for it.  Describe.  Or bees or something.  Excuse me?  There's a guy ripping apart a stuffed animal in a beekeeper, partial beekeeper suit.  Where?  He's an intern, I think.  Bill, he's not your friends.  We're your real friends. 
[03:51:30]  Where do you see the beekeeper?  Right there.  I see nothing.  Is Opie there?  Who?  Opie.  He's on his show.  Which you're supposed to be at.  I'm going to go over everyone in this room, and I want to know if they're really here.  There's a camera guy here.  No.  Okay.  There's a guy right there.  No.  In the corner?  Yeah.  No.  There's Fez, I think, there.  I'm Opie. 
[03:52:00]  There's Ron right there.  What's up, Bill?  How are you?  I'm great.  Yeah.  I'm happening, I guess.  Yeah.  Opie just left.  Opie just disappeared.  You see people that aren't here?  I think I might be.  A lot?  Does that happen a lot?  It does happen to me from time to time.  Where was he standing?  Right there.  And now he's suddenly gone?  Yes.  All right, when you see people disappear, you know they're not there. 
[03:52:30]  Well, sometimes I think they're there, and sometimes I think they're not there.  There's Opie.  That's Fez.  Hey, Bill.  Yeah.  Well, then where's Opie?  Opie's not here.  He's not?  Well, who's that?  That's Opie.  I thought you said he wasn't here.  Well, you saw him.  Who?  Why'd you point to him?  Quit trying to play your jokes, Bill.  I'm a comedian. 
[03:53:00]  I play jokes.  That is funny, though.  Yeah.  Laugh Riot.  Where are you booked?  I'm booked in Erie, PA, at Juniors, March 9th, 10th, and 11th, and then booked in Cambridge  in some hotel.  And what's today's date?  I don't even know.  So you're giving out last month's dates.  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  I mean, you're on the wrong show now.  I might be.  What makes you think you're ever going to the right show? 
[03:53:30]  I just want to get out of here.  And today is Sunday?  I'm Friday.  No.  Is that Earl?  Bill, look at me.  Where's Opie?  Pay attention.  You said you saw Opie.  Yeah. 
[03:54:00]  I saw Opie.  Where?  He was over there.  And now he's gone.  How do people disappear, Bill?  That's not Opie.  I'm not?  No, you're not Opie.  I'm Anthony.  That doesn't mean anything.  Don't hold that against him.  There's such a thing as a run.  You know how many people that aren't Opie without starting to accuse everybody?  You're not Opie.  So neither are you.  I know.  I don't want to be Opie.  A little bit. 
[03:54:30]  Well, yeah, a little bit, but.  Sure.  I don't know.  Right.  I'm confused.  Sure, it's kissing time.  Fez?  No.  This is Bill.  No.  I'm not kissing anyone.  You're on the wrong show.  Kiss me and I'll give you your pants back.  What is it, Bill?  I keep trying to get up and leave and some guy keeps telling me not to go.  What guy?  The guy in the corner.  Is that your conscience? 
[03:55:00]  I don't know what it is.  Hey, Jesus Christ.  What is that?  What happened?  Nothing at all.  Right.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Nothing something.  Nothing.  Someone grab me.  Sure.  Girl?  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  In a good way?  No.  Love?  No.  It wasn't love.  Well, my friend Bill Squire is a Mormon comedian.

[03:56:30]  I want to pass out something to you guys.  Here.  Why would you hand me a fish?  It's not a fish.  Why would you hand me a dead fish?  It's not a dead fish.  What is it?  It's a card.  It's a joke card.  You can't have dead fish in here.  Ugh.  Bill.  You're on the wrong show.  I know.  Can I leave?
