<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered extensively the aftermath of a major storm (Hurricane Sandy) in the New York City area. The show, largely conducted with a reduced staff due to the storm's impact, featured Opie and Anthony (with Anthony initially calling in from Long Island due to significant damage and power outages), Sal, Jim Norton, Troy, Sam Roberts, and Kenny (who had trouble reaching the studio).  The broadcast began with discussions about the storm's impact, including widespread power outages (like a Con Ed explosion in Lower Manhattan), flooding, downed trees, and the chaotic conditions on the streets, particularly noting the presence of numerous mentally unstable individuals downtown.  The hosts shared their personal experiences, contrasting their relatively mild Midtown experiences (mostly characterized by swaying buildings causing seasickness for some) with the more severe conditions downtown.

A significant portion of the show focused on the hosts’ differing approaches to covering the storm.  Some, dubbed "stormtroopers," actively ventured out into the storm (Anthony, Jim Norton, Roland, and Opie on separate occasions) to document the chaos, while others, like Sam Roberts, stayed in their hotels, leading to much humorous ribbing. Sam's hotel stay, attributed to a lack of available car services and expense concerns, became a recurring theme. The hosts shared amusing anecdotes from their “stormtrooping” experiences, including Jim Norton's meticulous preservation of his Starbucks coffee during the storm and Opie's photo-taking excursions.  Details of their hotel experiences, including a scathing review of the Carter Hotel and Sam washing his underwear in a hotel sink, were also shared.  Further details included the discovery of a shark in a New Jersey front yard and circulating fake photos of exaggerated storm damage.

The show included repeated attempts to reach a colleague, "E-Rock," whose home was severely damaged in the flooding.  These attempts were interspersed with jokes and insensitive questions regarding his family's well-being and his ability to obtain specific foods.  Discussions frequently veered off-topic, encompassing everything from Kristen Stewart to a CNBC reporter's on-air profanity.  Technical difficulties, particularly with the show's phone lines, hampered their ability to take calls and access online content.  The hosts also discussed the delayed Halloween, the seemingly impending departure of Scott Greenstein,  Sherman Hemsley's unburied remains, Jim Norton’s battered hands from punching a bag, and Ryback, a wrestler.  A George Carlin bit on natural disasters was played.  The show included numerous references to past events and inside jokes familiar to long-time listeners.  There was also extensive discussion about clothing, focusing primarily on Sal’s fashion sense.  A caller, "Weez," expressed concerns for his family in Long Island and highlighted communication difficulties due to the storm.  The show touched upon rumors of Donald Trump Jr.'s involvement in Opie's building management.  Finally, the show concluded with a brief outro containing repeated "Hey"s and a promotional announcement for their Facebook page and broadcast times.  The broadcast throughout included frequent use of crude humor, vulgar language, and sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What ever before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stung.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  Wow!  With O.B. the destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony.  The rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking  hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Why are you lowering that, Sal?  Sal's here.  Yeah.  This is weird.  Great.  He's literally the only guy that made it in.  Yeah.  Sam and Sal. 
[00:02:00]  We were joking yesterday, me and O.B. after, Sal's in the car in the car.  I'm like, how bad would it be if Sal got killed coming into work?  Like after all that bullying.  After the beating we gave him yesterday.  And then he comes in and hits him on the head.  We'd have to feel guilty.  And we're trying to hook up with Anthony, I guess.  He's stuck on Long Island.  Yeah.  He went home with the entire crew and they can't make it in today.  Yeah.  So, uh.  We don't have phones yet, though.  We don't have phones yet?  No.  When we have phones, we'll try to check in with Anthony, who's in the compound. 
[00:02:30]  Remind me not to take my weather advice from Anthony.  They kind of made that left turn, huh?  Yeah.  But I still don't think, like, it was bad.  But I still think it didn't hit as full on as they thought because the rain didn't get as much.  I think we're lucky that the rain didn't come as much.  Yeah.  But Jersey just got fucking destroyed.  Jersey Shore got destroyed.  Manhattan, it's easy.  For the most part, it's easy.  Well, that's stupid, really. 
[00:03:00]  It's easy where I am.  Uh, but the subways are flooded.  That's not easy.  And they're saying when the salt water gets into the subway system, my God, man, they got to redo all the wiring.  That can't be trusted.  Everything below 39th Street has no power.  I know.  And they were saying that even the stuff that they, because they turned off power voluntarily to avoid, like, you know, bad stuff with the water.  Right.  But they were saying even the stuff they turned off voluntarily could take, like, four or five days to turn back on.  Wow.  Did you see the picture?  Yeah.  Someone's taking a picture of, like, the Empire State Building in Midtown from Lower Manhattan. 
[00:03:30]  So it's complete darkness.  And then you see stuff lit up way in the distance.  Oh, no.  Just fucking creepy.  A ton of people are sending me pictures and videos.  So keep doing that.  I'm retweeting the better ones.  OP Radio on Twitter.  I just sent out a video of the Con Ed explosion that caused Lower Manhattan to go dark.  Oh, is there an explosion?  Yeah, a massive explosion.  And they got it on video, of course. 
[00:04:00]  They got everything on video.  Where was it?  I don't know.  I think 14th Street, I want to say.  14th Street.  I think so.  Yeah.  Near the FDR, maybe?  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, can we see the explosion?  I haven't seen it.  Yeah, it's pretty impressive, to say the least.  This is weird, man.  Fucking, I got up, went downstairs.  This ghoul, Kenny, goes, I'm at your residence.  I'm waiting for you.  And I go downstairs.  I go, Kenny, how the fuck did you get here? 
[00:04:30]  Because I had my car on standby.  I figured I'd make it.  I would walk here if I had to.  I'm not that far away from the studio.  And Kenny said, what?  The New Jersey Turnpike is closed down?  How did you get across the rivers?  The Lincoln Tunnel is the only thing open in and out of Manhattan.  Wow.  Yeah, all the other bridges and tunnels are closed still?  The Turnpike's closed.  I had to take one and nine.  Right.  Believe me, it was spooky because all the lights out are in Jersey, so you can't see anything. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  So you're just kind of driving in the dark with your headlights.  Yeah, and when the trees and power lines are down, you can't see them until you're right  on top of them.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, so.  But I'm here for you.  You didn't.  You could have went home.  Yeah, I could have.  Or stayed home, I should say.  I got a call from Kenny at like quarter to five, and he was like, I'm in the city.  Do you need a ride?  And I go, how did you get here?  But of course he got here.  Of course he did.  Of course Kenny got here. 
[00:05:30]  I got no power in my house.  Oh, you don't?  No, no.  Six o'clock.  He means that metaphorically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The lights kept going on and off every five minutes, and then 7.30, a house two doors  down from me, a tree fell and pulled all the lines down, so I'm screwed, because they  say it's going to take me like maybe a week to fix.  Oh, yeah.  This is going to be ugly for a while.  Our lights flickered a couple times.  I was watching, and I kept, but it was only part of it.  Like, my volume control on my speaker is different than my TV, so like that and my lamp were going, 
[00:06:00]  but my TV wasn't flickering, so like maybe, I don't know how half the power was flickering  and neither half wasn't.  Yeah, we got a couple flicks.  That's about it.  But I was getting updates.  I'm sure, just like everyone else, I'm sure it's the exact same scenario.  Everyone's phones with text messages.  And my brother's house took a massive hit.  Massive hit by a tree.  He's in like northern New Jersey.  I want to read his text.  And the rest of my family doing all right.  Let me see. 
[00:06:30]  We just had a tremendous tree land on our house.  Everyone's okay.  Damage, uncertain.  A tremendous tree.  What does that mean?  Yeah, that's not good.  And he doesn't exaggerate.  So if he's saying tremendous, that means it's quite impressive.  I'm waiting for pictures.  So, of course, my brother has a tree on his house.  I got a tree on my house.  It's called karma.  Shut up.  It's October rearing its ugly head.  Yeah, this is all Scott Shannon's fault.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people have a tree on their house today. 
[00:07:00]  I don't even know where to begin.  This is just crazy.  Oh, so then I went downstairs and Kenny's pretty much the only car on the street.  He's pretty much the only car on the street.  There's trees down across Broadway, you know, because it's so early on.  No cabs running.  No cabs running.  No other cars.  You know what's funny?  No delivery trucks.  No.  After everything yesterday.  Yeah.  Of not being able to get in and everything.  Troy left his apartment today on the bad day. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  And he grabbed a cab and he came in.  And he came in.  Yeah, we saw one cab the whole time.  I could not believe how eerie and quiet it was.  It was weird to have New York this quiet.  The two guys that got beat up for not coming in when it was not even, you know, a drizzle yet.  Right.  The two guys here today.  Yeah.  This business is so fucking weird.  You scared him straight.  Yeah, I guess we did.  I told Jimmy, I mean, you know, people have real problems with this storm, but I experienced something I've never experienced before. 
[00:08:00]  I'm in my apartment and all of a sudden I'm getting extremely lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseous.  And I'm like, what the fuck is going on with me?  Something, you know, is something really wrong with me?  So then I go to my wife.  I'm like, you feeling right?  She goes, no, I feel awful.  Lightheaded, you know, nauseous.  I go, is the gas on?  So we're checking the gas and all this other shit.  I'm like, you don't feel right.  Good.  I'm like, you know, whatever.  I'm thinking it might be food poisoning, what have you.  And then I finally figured out that the building was swaying so much we were getting seasick. 
[00:08:30]  And you didn't feel it?  Like, you don't feel it while you're standing in there?  Well, when you're aware, then you realize.  But at first, you know, the building is swaying.  I'm a Long Island kid.  I lived in houses.  Yeah.  So I'm walking around my apartment.  I'm like, why do I feel so shitty?  And then all of a sudden I saw, like, the water I was drinking and the water was moving.  Like it was Jurassic Park.  Was he doing that all night?  Yes.  I feel like shit right now.  So you had to try to sleep. 
[00:09:00]  But your brain, whatever your equilibrium is, knows that it's swaying.  Yeah, my brain couldn't figure it out.  And at one point at the height of the storm when I was rolling through Manhattan, I was  having a tough time walking around my apartment.  Did you take Dramamine?  No.  But you couldn't see it moving because you were moving with it, if that makes sense.  Well, there's nothing steady to measure it against with your eyes, so the whole thing  is moving.  It's not like you could look out the window and see something right in front of you.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Then you probably would have noticed it.  Yeah.  And then we filled up the bathtub, like I guess you're supposed to.  And the water was, like, moving in the bathtub.  I was going to take a video of that, but I'm like, no one's going to believe me.  They're going to think I fucking swished the water around.  Well, you're way up, too.  You're high.  I'm about 500 feet in the air.  Was it dramatic, like the water moving?  Or was it just kind of subtle?  Not dramatic enough to make some kind of video.  You know those videos you've seen of pools after an earthquake and shit moving?  Yeah.  That's what I was hoping for, splashing over the sides or something. 
[00:10:00]  No white caps in the bathtub?  No white caps.  But they say when you're 500 feet high, if the winds are like 50, 60 on the ground, it's  over 100 up there.  105, I think they were saying, at its peak.  But I'd never experienced that before, so I tweeted that.  And then Donald Trump Jr. was cool enough to say, you know, it's cool, don't worry about  it.  Because I don't know.  I was wondering, what the fuck does this mean, you know?  And he's like, the buildings, of course, are meant to do that.  And then some guy, some asshole, of course, is always an asshole, goes, how do you know  that? 
[00:10:30]  So Donald Trump Jr. just wrote him back.  Because we built the building he lives in, asshole.  You know, they're made to, you know, to take some heavy winds and earthquakes, if so be  it.  So.  I had a jerk off on Twitter, too.  Like, one of these guys.  They're, well, they'll always be there.  But that we used to know, and that was a dick.  Right.  At one point.  Like, he was fine.  We liked him.  And then he was a dick.  And he smashed me on whatever.  And then we talked.  And he was fine up until then.  And then he just, he just kind of makes like a cunt remark on Twitter. 
[00:11:00]  I'm like, enough with this fucking douchebag.  Yeah, just go away, man.  Go enjoy your lives.  Or don't enjoy them.  End him.  End him.  Right.  Don't obsess so much about us.  It's okay.  Go away.  It's all right.  But, yeah, it was funny.  It was scary yesterday.  There was moments where it was really fucking scary.  Yeah, my brain was a little weird.  I was like, this is fucking different.  This is strange.  I didn't get it.  But in the end, it was fine for us.  I was watching, like, news coverage for, like, hours. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And then I was getting really freaked out.  In your luxury hotel?  That's right.  I mean, I didn't feel anything where I was.  I was in Times Square in a nice hotel.  How'd you eat?  Room service?  Room service.  I did.  It was awesome.  And you were all freaked out, huh?  Well, because of the...  You know, people are standing on their roofs right now, right?  Well, that's the thing.  The news freaked me out.  And then I went outside, and I was like, it's fine where we are.  Yeah, Midtown is completely fine.  It's totally fine.  Midtown is completely fine.  This could be a normal day in Manhattan, in this area.  It's just a rainy day. 
[00:12:00]  But, you know, the lower Manhattan is pretty rough.  There's the explosion.  That's what I tweeted.  That's fucked up, man.  Yeah, it's everywhere.  And the subway's being flooded.  Did you see the water pouring into the battery tunnel?  The battery tunnel?  Yeah.  Like a river?  Yeah.  How the fuck do they get the water out of that?  Did you see that picture, too, of the Hoboken train station with all the water kind of water falling into it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Fucking amazing.  But people have dealt with way, way worse. 
[00:12:30]  I went to my gym and came back up, and my door wouldn't open.  And I'm like, that's fucked up.  I thought I might have to double lock it because I couldn't open the door.  And I finally forced my door open.  Right.  And there's just wind in my apartment.  And it was very, very strong.  My window had blown open.  Nothing.  It didn't blow off.  It was just like, if you're not hinged tight enough.  Sure.  And that stupid Bloomberg was right.  I'm glad I listened to the advice.  I kept the fucking blind, the shades down.  Right.  And that stopped us from opening all the way. 
[00:13:00]  So it just knocked some pictures off my windowsill.  But the wind just coming in from the way it had cracked.  Right.  And like going under the shade along the floor.  Yeah.  Was making it difficult for my door to open.  That was fucking brutal.  I got to tell you, I think we're pretty fair on this show.  We could be brutal, but I think we're also pretty fair.  Bloomberg did a really good job with this whole fucking thing.  Yeah, he was great.  I mean, we bitched yesterday that he probably could have kept the subway system open a little  longer to allow people to get home.  He closed it at seven.  I was thinking, you know, come on. 
[00:13:30]  You could go to midnight, whatever.  But in general, he's done an amazing job keeping people updated and keeping people calm.  They get, you know, get really freaked out in these situations.  And I'm loving the deaf interpreter.  Anyone else checking this shit out?  Where she knows how to sign dramatically.  And her facial expressions are matching Bloomberg's facial expressions.  Yeah.  Somebody will make a video out of that to capture it.  But have you seen her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just dramatically signing as the mayor's giving his press conferences. 
[00:14:00]  Um, and Pat from Munaki, I hope he's okay.  I guess a reservoir burst in, um, where the hell?  What's up that ways?  Munaki.  Well, I know.  Munaki.  Munaki.  And they're specifically saying it took out the trailer park up there.  And that's where Pat lives.  And that people are on roofs trying to get rescued.  I hope Pat's all right, man.  He's one of our own.  And then there's a fire in the Rockaways, right? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  That took out like 50 homes, they're saying.  Wow.  50 homes.  Just in that one fire.  So, six alarm.  What does that mean, six alarm?  Six alarm means.  Wow.  Get the fuck over there.  Yeah.  If you know anything about fucking fire and water, we need your help.  And there was one, it was in the city.  I don't know exactly where it was, but the entire front facade of a building completely  blew off.  Yeah.  You see that?  We jumped right by that, Jimmy.  I didn't see that.  Well, me and Jimmy and Roland were storm chasing. 
[00:15:00]  We got packed just in time.  It started getting ugly as soon as I dropped you off.  Dude, right where we were is where the fucking water started coming over.  And a couple hours later, it was totally flooded.  Yeah, I told you.  I told you that was going to happen.  I'm going out on an expedition.  Yeah.  To get eggs?  Try to get your breakfast.  So, wish me luck.  I don't know if I want eggs.  No.  I don't know.  Wasn't no good yesterday?  It was fine, but.  Roland's got survival cold cuts. 
[00:15:30]  We should treat ourselves.  We survived the big storm.  We should have a real nice breakfast this morning.  Some crispy bacon and some egg whites and maybe some pancakes or blueberry.  Yeah, I'll have that with egg whites.  Same egg whites.  I'm going to just do some bacon or something.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  Overcooked bacon would be nice.  Got to make that shit crispy.  Right, Roland?  Yeah.  Fucking Roland and Jimmy.  Me and Roland were driving around and then Jimmy saw a picture I tweeted and he goes, 
[00:16:00]  where are you?  And I wasn't going to write you back because I really thought you were going to say, you  have two kids.  Go home.  So, it took me a few minutes because I'm like, oh man, I don't want to deal with Jimmy telling  me to go home.  So, I finally wrote you back and he goes, pick me up.  I'm like, all right, cool.  So, me and Roland went back and got Jimmy and we tooled around Manhattan just as this  thing was hitting.  That was fun, man.  Yeah, we went down to Battery Park.  But me and Roland, before we picked you up, we were down a side street up on, off of Central 
[00:16:30]  Park West.  I was scared.  And all of a sudden, something fucking smashed into my windshield.  I'm amazed I didn't lose my windshield and I'm amazed that there's no cracks.  How bad was that fucking crash?  It was so loud.  I have no idea why it didn't shatter my windshield.  I was like, huh?  Yeah, he screamed like a little bitch.  I wasn't too far behind because I was just convinced something was flying into the windshield  of the car.  And it turns out, I have no idea what hit it and there's no damage on my car. 
[00:17:00]  But the fucking noise it made was so loud.  I thought we got hit by a tree or something.  I thought your glass was gone.  Yeah.  But we checked out the crane.  Yeah.  We were early on the crane thing, Roland.  Yeah.  There's a crane that most people must have seen it by now.  57th Street.  And a lot of people asking, that's like, I think, two doors down from where we used  to work, I believe.  It used to be an open lot as we were doing the walkover and stuff and walking home.  And now it's up to, I think, 80 stories high in the sky. 
[00:17:30]  And there's a crane.  And it's a partial collapse.  And that thing was dangling there throughout the entire storm, just fucking moving from  side to side.  And they were just waiting for this thing to plummet.  They said it was going to drop about 1,000 feet.  It's right across from Kearney Hall.  And it's going to be the tallest residential building in the city.  Right.  And that's all they kept saying on the news.  It's going to be a $90 million.  Apparently, it's not built yet.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, who cares?  It's an extremely tall building.  Wherever you are in Manhattan, you can see this thing popping over the top. 
[00:18:00]  It's unbelievable.  And the crane is just fucking up there, just dangling.  How are they going to fix that?  I don't know.  Probably a helicopter they have to kind of hook you up.  No, it's too heavy.  When the wind dies down, they'll just put up another crane and just use another crane  to get it.  Now, they said on the news, you like to think you're a man.  You like to think that you're a little tough.  And even us driving around yesterday, you felt like, oh, we're adventurous. 
[00:18:30]  We're a little dangerous.  They said on the news, a couple guys climbed up there to assess the situation with the  crane in the middle of the winds.  Can you imagine?  It might fall.  Exactly.  You're on a thing that's dangling and blowing in the wind.  I think they went up through the building, obviously, because then there's floors that  aren't complete right around that area.  And they were just taking peeks to see what they could figure out. 
[00:19:00]  74 stories up in the middle of those winds.  Because you could get blown right the fuck out of the building.  Once in a while that happens, a guy gets blown out by a gust.  But those are real men.  They knew they had to go up there and check the shit out, you know?  I do enjoy your picture-taking technique.  Mine.  You go, press, press, and everybody moves out of the way.  Are you doing the press?  Yeah, because we got our tricks.  He stops in the middle of the street.  Press, press, press. 
[00:19:30]  There's cops everywhere.  So, like, the one picture I took, it was, like, 22nd Street and 9th Avenue, maybe?  Somewhere around there.  Huge tree down.  And I'm like, fuck traffic and everything.  I just stop my car, and there's cops everywhere.  And I jump out.  I just go, press, press.  And I pull out my stupid fucking Android.  My Samsung.  What press uses their cell phone to take photos?  And then I quickly take a picture, and we jump back in, and we take off.  Scoop Hughes using his phone.  And actually, in that situation, we didn't take off fast enough, because the cops were, 
[00:20:00]  like, looking at us.  I'm like, hey.  Thank you.  I go, stay safe.  Get home to your families.  And then we moved on to all the shit around the city.  Made it down to Battery Park.  That's where all the newsmen go.  So, and that, oh, the Weather Channel guy was down there.  And in between takes, they just sit there, and they check their Twitters, and they check  their text messages, and then they go on camera, and they just dramatically have to, like, fucking 
[00:20:30]  make it way worse than it is.  I'm not saying the storm wasn't bad.  Of course it was.  But what we were seeing at Battery Park, these jerk-offs just kind of hanging around, checking  their Twitters in between their live shots.  And then they would go on camera going, oh, my God, look how dramatic this is.  And Roland got a great picture of that guy who was on the jet ski.  Yeah.  They had a really good action shot of him.  Jet ski man.  Yeah, man.  We were down there when the jet ski guy came around.  It was on a lot of the news programs.  Of course.  I made a quick video of it. 
[00:21:00]  It's on my YouTube channel.  But I bet he wasn't jet skiing two hours after we saw him around there.  No.  No fucking way.  But I think they got him jet skiing across the East River, too.  This fucking animal, man.  I mean, how high were those waves?  Probably close to 10 feet in that area at times?  8 to 10 feet?  There's my video.  Fuck yeah.  I'll retweet it this morning so you can check it out.  But here's this jerk-off just jet skiing right off Battery Park, the lower tip of Manhattan. 
[00:21:30]  You can see the Statue of Liberty in the background, Jersey City.  And the news crews, like, we were loving it.  Jimmy, you can hear him loud as day in the video go, I hope he falls off.  People were enjoying that.  And then I got to explain that shot in the video.  And then, like, we're like, he's obviously an adventurer.  He's obviously into extreme sports.  He's a jet ski guy.  He knows what the fuck he's doing. 
[00:22:00]  And then the news crews have to be so dramatic down there.  This one lady from Channel 4 is like, hold on a second.  Yeah.  I'm getting a call from Ant.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, Ant.  You're on speaker.  We got you through the mic.  Well, thank you.  I'm trying so hard to actually do the radio show with you guys.  And the phones don't work.  We're trying to get them hooked up, but they're not, they're not, they're not, it's not going  through.  This is terrible. 
[00:22:30]  I've managed to string together an entire studio in a vast realm of darkness and no power.  I've done everything I could to, uh, to, to, to power my studio up.  And then I can't get the phones to work because of you guys.  It's your side, not mine.  Yeah.  We get, we get no phones at all here.  Yeah.  They're working on the phones.  I'm very upset.  How is your, uh, how's your place?  Uh, it's fine, actually.  I got a few refugees here, but, uh, actually the, uh, the neighborhood's covered with trees. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Giant, uh, trees are across, uh, the roads.  I went out for a drive at about 3.30 in the morning to get some gas for the generator.  And, uh, it's really bad.  Wires are down everywhere.  Trees are down everywhere.  Well, you said this was, wasn't going to make the left turn.  Uh, you know what?  I think I might have been wrong.  It could have been a miscalculation on my part. 
[00:23:30]  But it, it made, it, it moonwalked over to the left.  It really did.  Pretty much stomped on your house.  I'm amazed at that.  Holy.  Um, really amazing though.  Long Island, it took a massive hit.  I have people here that are, uh, from the South shore of Long Island.  And, um, uh, all the fire and floods and everything that you've been seeing, um, near,  houses away from these people.  And, um, Lee, look, poor Lisa's sitting there in front of me. 
[00:24:00]  And, uh, uh, all night she was very distressed about, uh, her house.  Uh, but, uh, unfortunately I have their, their dogs here too.  You know, I hate the fucking animals in my house.  And they breathe heavy on me with their hot breath.  And they always gotta pee and shit.  So the dog, so the, their dog really is, sounds like the elephant man.  It really is creepy.  Travis and Lee's stupid French bulldog.  It sounds like a zombie from The Walking Dead or that kid from The Grudge.  I'll be sitting on the couch and I hear, uh, and I get petrified. 
[00:24:30]  I don't need that shit.  I get anxiety.  How, how is their, their apartment?  Uh, do they have any word yet or they don't know?  Uh, well, apparently someone.  Water got into the basement.  The power went out.  I think the whole neighborhood is burnt down.  Um, I think you're okay though, right?  Your, your place.  And then, yeah.  And then, uh, Keith and Andrew's house had four feet of water in the first floor.  Wow.  It was up halfway up the walls of, uh, the, the first floor of their house. 
[00:25:00]  Um, and Keith, uh, was also on, uh, uh, fire detail over there at the fire department,  uh, in the town he's in.  And him and the other guys had to literally watch a house burn down.  They watched the house burn down without knowing if there was anyone in it or anything  because they couldn't get to it with the equipment.  Wow.  They just couldn't get there with us from the wires, uh, the water.  Um, yeah, they, they just couldn't get to it.  So they, they stood there and watched the house burn down.  Yeah, I read a Facebook post that he, uh, he put up and it was four feet of water, but 
[00:25:30]  his house, it's not destroyed.  Like he lost, I'm sure, a lot of stuff, but it, like, at least the, the structure's still  there, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That's about, you know, what I've been saying to, you know, John's based on that shit,  apparently.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it sucks to lose any, any of your stuff, but.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  You gotta put your, uh, put your posty vac and your big dildos on the, uh, on the floors  where they can't get protected with water. 
[00:26:00]  It's, it's amazing how you realize how your stuff just isn't protected.  Yeah.  In your, in your fucking house.  Like, you think it is, but man, it's like, you know, if it's not more than, if it's less  than 10 feet in the air, it's not necessarily safe from weather damage.  Your stuff doesn't mean shit in the end.  Yeah.  What's that noise?  I'm checking out a video.  Oh.  I don't know why they can't figure out the phone. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what the problem is.  There's no, but then again, there's no one.  There's no one in there that says, uh, that the whole circuits are busy.  I tried, uh, uh, pleading with the audience to not call them in hand, uh, but apparently  they're not listening.  Yeah.  They all have loved ones.  They're trying to call and see if their family's safe.  I'm trying to get through and do a show. 
[00:27:00]  God damn it.  It's eerie, dude.  It's fucking eerie.  The city this morning is just, it's just dark.  Like you always, I've never seen, uh, not, not like such a little activity.  Even five 30 in the morning or five o'clock in the morning.  It's usually, there's always people around and it's just fucking really, really creepy.  Well, it's going to be more eerie when, when, when the sun, when the sun comes up, that's  when it's going to be even more eerie.  All right.  Look, I'm going to try to get these phones working.  Um, well, you try to get them working.  Mine work.  Okay.  And, uh, in the meantime, I'm just going to goof around on the, uh, live front of the 
[00:27:30]  compound show.  All right.  Well, I'm looking at you right now.  And, uh, so hopefully we'll get the, hopefully we'll get the phones working.  Look, I'm waving.  I'm waving.  Not yet.  You're not.  You're on a little bit of a delay.  I'll tell you when I see you wave.  There you go.  I just saw you wave.  Oh, oh, hi.  Here we go.  All right.  Let me jerk off.  All right, kid.  All right.  So fun showing.  The phone's working.  God damn it.  All right, buddy.  All right.  There goes Anthony from, uh, his Hayos out there on Long Island with a lot of trees and  wires down.  I'll say the iPhone speakerphone, more impressive than I thought. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So anyway, we're down at, uh, the battery park in the fucking jet skier.  I mean, we're loving it cause we know the guy is fine.  And then you got the local news girl, like just dramatically trying to talk to the guy.  Do you realize a hurricane's coming?  Why would you do that?  And he's just sitting in the water being interviewed and there's no danger.  To this guy whatsoever.  I've never regretted not doing chip as much as I did at that moment.  I was like, I should have just started yelling chip things to him. 
[00:28:30]  And, uh, I just fucking didn't.  No, the guy was cool as hell, man.  I'm sure he's completely safe today.  He knows exactly what he was doing yesterday.  No, no.  I mean on camera though.  So the news report interview would have been ruined just to have me in the background  yelling, it's how come they don't call it him a canes?  We should have done a chip report live from battery park with those idiots down there.  I didn't think of that either.  It was a party down there, right?  Yeah.  It was a lot different what they were showing on TV because it was raining. 
[00:29:00]  There was no real wind and we're all just laughing and goofing off and having fun.  And Roland was getting recognized because of his Instagram.  And, uh, and then they would go on camera and have to like put on that whole act for everybody.  That's why I was able to, I had to leave the hotel to stop like panicking that this was  an apocalypse because once you leave and you're just out there, you're like, okay, it's a  bad storm, but we'll be all right.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  You gotta be really careful.  Who the fuck knows what could fall from above. 
[00:29:30]  But my wife, uh, you know, cause she's following me on Twitter cause she, you know, I left the  house.  I said, I got to check this shit out.  And, uh, she's a little worried and I'm like, man, I don't know what they're showing  you on TV, but it's a party down here.  This it's easy.  There's nothing going on.  We're not going to be thrown in the water.  There's nothing.  There's no rain.  The waters aren't rising yet.  This is just fun down here.  Yeah.  You know?  But then, like I said, they go on, on TV and man, they fucking, they fucking changed  their tune.  It got bad though.  Right after we left.  Of course.  Of course it did. 
[00:30:00]  That's when the real wind, we were there.  There was zero wind and there was wind uptown, but right in battery park, there was, it was  really, really bizarre.  Just high, high wave swells.  And then a few times I'm standing by the edge and it was like, and it bubbled.  It's like when a tub, when you're splashing a little wave goes just a little bit over  the rim, a little over the rim, and then I could see it coming over the rim, over the  rim, and it started, more and more started.  Did you watch the coverage later on?  The exact spot we were in, they were up to their knees.  Yeah, it got bad.  It was pretty impressive, so. 
[00:30:30]  Dirty Hudson River water.  Yeah.  You think that's bad?  Fucking horrible, dude.  That was the other thing that was fun about watching the coverage, was you could watch the  newscasters realize what was happening, and they quickly went from like early in the  day to talking about wind and rain to strictly talking about the surges.  They were like, well, it's going to be, because, you know, the wind and rain really wasn't  as bad.  Yeah, they were predicting, I believe, up to 10 inches of rain for the area, and it  turned out to, that part of it, you know, it was like maybe an inch, inch and a half 
[00:31:00]  of rain.  That was it.  That's where we got lucky.  Imagine 10 inches of rain on top of, you know, the surge that Manhattan got.  Yeah.  If it wasn't, and this was a bad one.  This was what they said, tropical storm slash category one.  It kept going back and forth.  Right.  But can you imagine a fucking category three or four storm, how awful that must be to be  stuck in?  Well, I'm sure that'll be the next thing.  Dude, that's brutal.  We'll get that eventually.  And I don't know how much strength, how strong are these windows?  Like, my windows didn't, the one thing that blew up was just latched, but it's like, you 
[00:31:30]  realize how vulnerable you are when you're in an apartment and there's a lot of glass  around you.  Like, there's not a fucking thing I can do about it.  Nothing.  Nah.  Yeah, that's just like your house being underwater, worrying about the windows blowing in.  Oh, I got it.  No, it's not that bad, no.  Did anyone else get the Irog text?  No.  No.  Hopefully, does it rhyme?  Irog.  It rhymes with resign.  I will just read this.  Hey, are you watching the skies over Jersey?  It's constantly white, blue, and pink flashes in the sky. 
[00:32:00]  And then he writes, lightning struck a tree next to my place, cut it in half, and took  out a transformer.  Kaboom.  What?  And then-  He wrote kaboom?  Yeah.  And then he's just kind of having fun with the whole thing, the storm, right?  The next text.  And I hope everything's all right.  I really do.  But it's Irog.  So you don't know what to believe with this kid.  Am I right, Sam?  Of course.  It's vagaries, and it's dramatics, always.  Way over the top dramatic.  Of course.  And I'm not-  And you know what?  What he wrote here- 
[00:32:30]  Did he go-  Could be completely accurate and all that, okay?  But he's cried wolf so many times, I don't know what to believe with this kid.  It's accurate 30% of the time.  Right.  He writes, you know, he went from having fun with the storm to, hey, I'm not coming in  the rest of the week.  My brother's family is trapped on the second floor of their house.  As soon as I can, I'm heading out there to help them.  What are they, refugees?  But all of a sudden, he goes, I'm not coming in the rest of the week.  Why a week off do you need? 
[00:33:00]  It was Monday when he said that.  You're not a rescue worker.  And I know if he was listening to this, he would probably start yelling at me if he was  in that studio.  But the problem is, like we've said, he's so dramatic all the time, we don't know what's  right.  Of course.  Obviously, a lot of houses got flooded out.  So obviously, his brother's house got flooded out, and they had to move to the second story,  which sucks, of course.  But how's he going to get up there?  I don't know.  What's he going to do besides be a hindrance?  He's not even helpful here on the radio show.  Never.  You don't think he's good with a rowboat? 
[00:33:30]  No, I don't.  I don't.  Or he'll have someone paddle it for him.  Right.  Push.  And then he'll misunderstand this part of the show today.  He misunderstands.  So I'm just trying to say, like, you know, he's always dramatic.  How can you make the announcement?  And obviously, there's a situation there, and it sucks.  But like, my brother has a, what did my brother say?  He's got a massive tree in his house.  Yeah.  A Scott Shannon-sized tree.  A tremendous tree landed on his house.  You just reminded me I should text my family?  What a rotten son. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  You didn't even fucking talk to your family, aren't they, down at the Jersey Shore?  Yeah.  They're kind of in one of those beach towns, aren't they?  Maybe Eric could pick them up.  I'm so fucking dumb.  Like, the world-famous Jim Norton, his parents might be in a shelter, and Jimmy doesn't even  know it.  No, I forgot.  I forgot.  I'm terrible.  I called my parents twice yesterday, and they're only in Westchester.  Yeah.  I'm an awful son.  I didn't even think about my family being in Atlantic City.  I didn't even think about it.  Yeah, Long Island got destroyed, man.  Because those trees love to come down.  Ever since I was a kid, any type of, you know, storm that rolls through, those trees love 
[00:34:30]  coming down.  So I can't even imagine how bad it is out there on Long Island today.  I can't even imagine it.  And then the flooding on the South Shore.  At some point today, I want to talk to E-Rock on the phone and just find out what this  rescued thing, because it might be legit.  Not just to make fun of him.  I don't, I bet, of course it's legit.  I'm sure that there's a problem.  Of course he's got a situation in his family.  Of course.  Of course.  But how he just goes, hey, I'm taking the rest of the week off.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Is that a rational conclusion to come to?  Which we all should take care of our family before this dopey show, you know, but you know  what I'm trying to say.  Yeah.  He's a, yeah.  How are you, Roland?  I'm fine.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Didn't have room service.  A little panicked, but I'm okay.  No, it's just weird.  Manhattan is just, you know, completely closed down.  Yeah.  You can't, you basically can't get on, on this little island of ours.  And the bridges and subways are shut down, so I'm stuck. 
[00:35:30]  No cabs.  The cabbies that are out there, they're going home.  Yeah.  After their shifts.  And all the, yeah, all the bridges are closed.  All the highways leading out are closed.  And FDR is a river, so they can't cross.  Oh, is the FDR, I bet.  Nah, I don't think anymore.  This water starts subsiding pretty quickly.  It's still closed.  Did you see outside our buildings?  The West Side Highway, the water was under the West Side Highway.  The Hudson River was actually under the West Side Highway.  You know what?  I did not.  No.  And then I looked this morning, it was all, you know, already back in where it's supposed 
[00:36:00]  to be.  Were those little things flooded the, um, you know, uh.  The piers?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The one pier you couldn't really even see.  Yeah, Long Island City, it was underwater, the park and the piers.  They closed the Henry Hudson Bridge, and the Henry Hudson Bridge is ridiculously high.  It's not even close to the water.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Maybe the high winds.  No, the high winds.  Maybe.  If the winds get up to a certain, um, certain speed, they, they shut those bridges down.  So.  Yeah, this was a fucking rough one. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to hear from people, but we don't have phones, so it makes it a little tougher.  I can't believe I didn't talk to my family.  What an awful son.  I forgot they all lived in Jersey.  I just blocked it out.  Yeah, that's terrible.  I hope, uh, I hope Pat's all right, man.  They're saying that this Munaki, uh, situation is bad.  Took out the whole trail of the park.  I'm surprised he didn't end up at Ants or something.  I don't know.  Maybe he did get out of there.  I hope so.  But they weren't, uh, getting people out of that area.  It was, a levee broke.  Oh. 
[00:37:00]  They said the town of Munaki has four or five feet of water.  Mm.  And that it, that it completely, uh, you know, took over the whole trail of park.  It didn't take out the trail of park, but it, you know, flooded it extremely, uh, badly.  So.  Ah.  Ah.  Well, what else do you want to do?  Can we go home?  We made our fucking appearance.  I know we lost power in Westchester, but, you know, Jess and I weren't there, obviously.  But my sister lives in our building, too.  And she said all the power was totally out.  I think my parents lost power, too. 
[00:37:30]  Those are powers easy.  Yeah.  I just hope it doesn't take, like, five or six days to come back.  Trees coming down on your car or your house.  That's awful.  That's not easy.  Or, or the floodwaters coming in and taking over your basement or your first story.  Yeah.  When you lose power, though, there's a bizarre party that feels it's never going to come back on.  Really?  Yeah, it's scary.  Like, it's fucking scary.  Like, it's not going to come back.  It would be really strange to be cut off from the world.  Like, when we were growing up, it was just part of living.  It was cut off, yeah.  You got to cut off from the world every once in a while.  You didn't think twice about it. 
[00:38:00]  Could you imagine?  No cell service and your lights going on, how weird that would be for people nowadays?  How great was Governor Christie yesterday?  Fucking smashing that asshole mayor in Atlantic City, who advised his people to stay there  or his constituents to stay there, and they were putting him in shelters or, like, a block  from the water, and Christie went on and blasted him by name.  He said, I don't know why mayor, whatever his name is, Langhorne or something, I forget  his name, and ignored my warning. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  And then that mayor blasted Christie.  Did he?  Basically saying, how dare you, yeah.  Fuck that mayor.  How dare you?  Yeah, it turned out there was, like, floodwaters in all the main streets of Atlantic City.  That's, you know, when you get away from the casinos, it's really shitty.  So why was the guy blasting Christie?  The house thing is really shitty.  When he advised people to stay.  Because no one wants to be, you know, told they're doing something wrong.  Do you have the clip of Governor Christie?  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  We hear that, yeah.  Buffer.  Buffering.  Buffering.  Does our internet even work?  Yeah, right.  For whatever reason, Mayor Lankford urged people to stay in shelters in the city.  Despite my admonition to evacuate, he gave them comfort, for some reason, to stay.  We now have a large number of people, we can't quantify it at this point, that are in Atlantic City. 
[00:39:30]  And at this juncture, there is no other way for us to go in and get them.  They're going to have to ride out the storm there until at least 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.  I cannot in good conscience send rescuers in as the storm is about to hit in the next hour, nor can I send them in in the dark, given all the various hazards that would occur potentially to them.  And so I asked these people to leave for some reason. 
[00:40:00]  The mayor, in his initial conversations with the public, told them he didn't want his people leaving Atlantic City.  So you have people staying either self-sheltering in their homes or sheltering in some city shelters there, one of which is literally a block away from the bay in a school, which is now flooded completely.  So for those of you who are on the barrier islands who decided it was a better idea to wait this out than to evacuate, and for those elected officials who decided to ignore my admonition, this is now your responsibility. 
[00:40:30]  If you're still able to hear me, we need you to hunker down and get to the highest point possible in the dwelling that you're in.  We will not be able to come and help you until daylight tomorrow.  Please try to hunker down and stay safe until then.  Wow.  I couldn't believe, I was watching that live, I couldn't believe he said it.  I was like, wow, that's a fuck, that's a black, that's literally, that's the equivalent of calling somebody a cunt.  Sure, yeah.  That's brutal.  When shit hits the fan, you see who the real leaders are. 
[00:41:00]  You know, obviously the guy down in Atlantic City doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.  What a bum.  What a fucking bum.  Doesn't have a clue what could have, you know, happened down there.  And then you got guys like Governor Christie, we've beat him up pretty good on the show as well, but, man, you know, he fucking has been doing great as well through this whole thing.  Yeah.  He's been doing great, and Mayor Bloomberg certainly doing real well.  Yeah, Bloomberg was right.  And then Governor Cuomo was kind of wandering around Manhattan last night checking shit out, so. 
[00:41:30]  Now what?  More than 7 million people, what, did that just say?  Without power, probably?  So we're not broadcasting to anyone, Sam?  Oh, we're broadcasting, because you know why?  Yeah.  People are going out in their cars like Tom Green's mom and just sitting there listening, enjoying the show.  Yeah, from ground zero of Hurricane Sander.  So Letterman and Fallon performed to empty studios, huh?  Oh, they did that shit?  They had no audiences.  Well, fucking call me.  I'll sit in that audience for you.  They sent their audiences home. 
[00:42:00]  They didn't.  Yeah, but I'm in Manhattan.  They weren't looking for audiences.  That was like the thing.  Yo, Jimmy Fallon, I would have been in your audience.  I would have done Letterman.  I was right by.  You could have done Letterman.  Yeah.  We're not saying doing the show.  I mean, just help the guys out.  Sit in the audience.  Woo!  Funny joke.  And I would have sat in Fallon's fucking audience.  How great would have been during the monologue?  An audience of one, that would have been awesome.  One guy being like, that is hilarious.  Denzel did Letterman in a rain slicker.  Oh, really?  We made it there, yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  No one watched, because everyone was watching the storm coverage. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  It was all about storm coverage last night.  They all did pretty good.  The media, we beat them up, too.  But they did all right.  You know.  Dude, I couldn't believe.  But it was funny, because they all had to admit that they, they, they all had to admit  very subtly that they do exaggerate, but they're not exaggerating this time.  Yes.  Anyone else pick up on that?  Absolutely.  They didn't want to say, okay, you got us.  We're, we're fear-mongering assholes.  But they hinted, like, look, um, sometimes we might, but this time, how many times did 
[00:43:00]  they say, this time it's really going to happen?  Right, right.  It's actually going to be bad.  Right.  But I couldn't believe, uh, like, on CBS here in New York, Maurice Dubois and that chick  he's with, I got to the hotel.  The one that looks like, uh, an old, uh, a young Steven Tyler?  Maybe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Think about it.  I got to the, I got to the hotel.  You'll see what I'm talking about.  At, like, maybe quarter to one in the afternoon.  Right.  At 9.30 at night, they were still sitting there at that desk broadcasting. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  Those two were there all day long.  And not, like, for cutaways.  Like, straight, the entire channel all day was just Maurice Dubois and that chick.  I'm saying his name.  I love his name, though.  So they had to sit and read for how many hours straight?  That must have been tough for them.  Like, 10 hours.  That's a long broadcast day.  That must be tough.  All right.  I got zombies walking around my building right now because these guys couldn't go home.  The, the, the, the maintenance guys and, uh, and the doorman and all that, they're 
[00:44:00]  just, they haven't slept in, like, days.  I fired my housekeeper because she couldn't make it today.  Yeah, I was pissed, too.  She lost two gigs because we fired her, too, there, Jimmy.  Troy was saying.  I said, how dare you not clean my place?  He took a cab in for real today?  Yeah.  And he was saying that the cabbie was, like, almost in tears.  He just wanted to go home so bad.  He was so tired.  Yeah, he was exhausted.  He said, Troy told me that the cabbie was like, I just, I just want to go somewhere to  sleep for two hours.  I just need two hours.  We have a jerk-off that works in our building.  He lives. 
[00:44:30]  They said, wow.  Fucking A, the Weather Challenge just has a nice video of a tree just crashing down onto  a car.  I love living through this time.  Everything is just being filmed.  It's amazing.  Anyway, this jerk-off lives about 10 blocks from, you know, the building I live in, and  he called out, meaning the guys that were there had an opportunity to get home to their  families before they shut everything down, and because this jerk-off who works, lives 
[00:45:00]  10 blocks away, called out.  They had to stay, and one of the guys has been there for three days now.  10 blocks away and he didn't come in?  They fucking hate him.  They hate him, because we're talking about guys that live in Brooklyn.  Is he a maintenance guy or a doorman?  He works like the front desk.  Right.  Do I see him when I'm there, or no?  He's a jerk-off.  I don't even want to say his name.  Okay, of course not.  But is he old or young?  He's like middle-aged.  You could just tell he's a jerk-off.  He's one of those guys.  He can't even fake it. 
[00:45:30]  You know what I mean?  He just can't even fucking, like, go through the motions and make believe he's cool.  He wouldn't come in 10 blocks?  He called out.  He did a sal.  Oh.  No.  He did a sal.  He called out yesterday when it was easy.  So then these guys had the opportunity to go home after their shift Monday, yesterday,  around this time, let's say, or a little later in the morning.  But because this guy called out, they had to do his shift.  And by the time his shift was over, they were stuck there, because now everything was shut down. 
[00:46:00]  I wish I could have treated him like Sal, and they all could have just gotten on the phone with him and blasted him.  No eye contact with Sal today.  A little awkward.  No.  How you doing, Sal?  You're in E-Roc's position today.  I'm doing all right.  Couldn't do worse.  How'd you get in today?  How do you get in today?  How much chair is that it's Sal in my E-Roc?  Oh, no.  You got in yesterday?  Dude, Sal was so...  You shook him up so bad.  I hope so.  At like, whatever time it was that I was leaving here yesterday, early afternoon, like maybe noon, Sal was coming up the elevator. 
[00:46:30]  He got here to the studio at like noon yesterday.  Like, I gotta change the password on my email.  I gotta do...  Sal, that's a good start.  And he got a hotel room, and he was like, I'm staying in this, on this island.  And I will be in tomorrow morning.  Good for you, Sal.  Thank you.  And Troy called me at like 4.15 this morning.  He woke me up, and he was like, dude, I'm here.  There's no cabs.  It doesn't look like my car service isn't coming.  They've just given up answering the phone. 
[00:47:00]  So I'm gonna get my chick, and we're gonna walk from wherever he lives.  I know where he lives.  It's far.  Yeah.  He walked all the way here?  No, and then he found a cab, because there's cabs outside.  He dramatically said, if I have to walk, I'll walk.  But he was gonna walk, so...  Are we gonna get to see Troy Kwan today?  He's here.  He's been hiding.  I've been here over an hour, and I haven't seen him yet.  He's here.  Over an hour.  I've been here.  Whatever.  I gotta eat.  Like it matters.  He's a member of the skeleton crew.  Here's Troy Kwan.  I gotta talk to Troy Kwan.  He still looks like a million bucks, by the way. 
[00:47:30]  What's up, Troy?  What's up, man?  Just so you know, you didn't get beat up as much as Sal did yesterday.  No, I know.  And I probably deserved more than you guys gave me, so...  Sal got killed, huh?  Yeah, he did.  He had destroyed.  I'm not bothered by you as much, because you're set in your ways.  I'm trying to, like, get the young kids on the right track.  Yeah, no, I mean...  Because I've seen so many Sal's make this dumb mistake, and I just don't want to see Sal  make that same dumb mistake.  What's going on with you, Troy?  Just, uh... 
[00:48:00]  I told you, I was going to be here today, no matter what.  I mean, I literally was going to walk in if I had to, so...  Nice.  He's got the...  He wants that down-for-whatever credibility that he had a minute ago?  Yeah, I lost it.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Well...  Down-for-whatever, and you didn't make it in yesterday when it wasn't even raining yet.  Well, we lost our power down where I live, down near the Lower East Side.  Right.  And it's crazy down there, man, because there's cops on, like, about four...  Every four blocks, there's a cop, and they keep their lights on, but there's homeless  people just walking around and talking, and then there's, like, a bodega owner. 
[00:48:30]  He's just peeking his head out the door.  He's like, do you need anything?  Do you need anything?  And we're like, no, we're good, but he's keeping his door closed.  That way, you know, people aren't robbing the hell out of him.  But yeah, downtown, man.  Is it flooded out over there?  It's not flooded.  I mean, it's flooded out more towards the East River.  Right.  But in our neighborhood, it's fine, but it's pretty fun.  And it's crazy.  There's just no lights on.  I know.  It's weird.  Oh, you're in that zone.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Everything is completely dark.  Right.  Oh, man.  That's crazy, because you live where it's still, like, old-school New York down there. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, man.  It's shady when all the lights are on, usually.  A couple blocks over, it starts getting really bad.  Yeah, I know where you are.  So, yeah, and they start wandering towards where the money is.  The beauty of Manhattan, when this shit happens, like these weird storms or a heat wave, that's  when the crazy people decide to leave their apartments.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you think they would stay in at that point?  No, they love the chaos of it all.  They're the ones wandering around. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, if you're, I love, you know, people know by now I'm a people watcher.  I mean, this is the best time, because there are lunatics now just wandering around out there.  I don't know what happens in their brain where, on a beautiful, just normal day, they have to be shut-ins.  But if a hurricane comes through or it's 110 degrees out, that's when they decide they've got to be out there.  Yeah.  It's bizarre.  I didn't post this picture, but we were at a diner yesterday, and it's pouring down rain.  And this crazy guy is just walking around dancing in the street. 
[00:50:00]  He had music on, and he's just sashaying down the street, dancing, hands up in the air.  He didn't give a shit.  What are these guys on down there, you think?  You know, I just think it's like just mental illness.  Old school, it was like the H, the heroin, the heroin down there.  Some guy in Dwayne Reed yesterday was absolutely on something, because he was acting like he was listening to music the entire time.  But it was just like this black guy who was acting like he was listening to rap music, but he had no earphones in.  And he was just like dancing and moving around and looking at people. 
[00:50:30]  And like, you know, the cashiers are looking at him like, what the fuck is this guy going to do?  Yeah, if you want to fucking see some really strange, weird people, today's the day to walk around.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  So, that's it.  That's your update.  Yeah, man.  I mean, I'm here.  I was going to make sure I made it in.  The craziest part of this whole storm, though, is that, like, just like on Manhattan itself, like Troy is sitting there, and it's like, he's worried about flooding, and there's no power, and there's homeless people walking around. 
[00:51:00]  And then you go, like, blocks up to Times Square, and I'm looking out my window like, oh, my God, when is this?  And it just doesn't hit.  Like, the lights around the Jersey Boys sign is still lit up right.  You know?  I kind of feel, I'm not going to lie to you, I kind of feel guilty.  Yeah, like.  I feel like I should have gone through a little more shit than I really did.  There was literally nothing happening in Midtown.  Yeah, I mean, like I said, I got seasick because my building was swaying, so my fucking building was swaying so much I got seasick.  Yeah.  I've never experienced that before. 
[00:51:30]  It's the weirdest fucking thing to be way up in the sky and feeling your whole building.  I would love to know how many feet the actual building was moving.  Can anyone figure that out for me?  I've heard, like, it could move in easily 10 feet.  Wow.  Easily.  I've heard that.  I don't know if it's true.  There's a formula at the height of the building.  It's called a convection sway.  You can do that by, with multiplication.  I just made that up.  Thank God.  Multiplication.  I'm kind of with Sam. 
[00:52:00]  I don't want to, like, I don't know.  Like, you're just watching, like, oh, my God, the front of that building just blew up.  People are calling you, like, a tree fell.  I'm losing power.  It's human nature to kind of pump up your experience.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting here like, you know what?  All I got is, I got a little nauseous because my building was swaying.  My lights never went out.  I never lost the internet.  No.  I was able to tweet and check out Twitter all night.  I kept running to the window.  And, I mean, the lights of Times Square stayed on.  Yeah.  It really didn't rain very hard. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  I got to watch all my TV.  There were some strong gusts while I was out there, I suppose.  Yeah, yeah.  My fucking windows were, like, wobbling a few times.  My windows remained unaffected.  Have you ever lost power in your building?  Uh, no.  No.  Because you're kind of high up.  So what happens-  Way the fuck up.  So what happens with your elevators?  And usually they shut down the elevators.  They didn't even shut the elevators down.  At one point, my wife went downstairs and got cookies.  She wanted to make cookies in the middle of the fucking storm.  Yeah.  Okay, good time.  She goes, I'm going to the store. 
[00:53:00]  I'm like, you know what?  I think you can go to the store.  Go get some air.  Yeah, yeah.  As people are fucking getting flooded out.  E-Rock's panicking and-  Well.  You know.  But-  E-Rock's not going to be here for the rest of the week.  Yeah, no.  He's got a situation.  I was listening to the show yesterday.  I was like, if guys are leaving the city, there's no plans of them ever coming back in tomorrow.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, I know.  I've-  Yeah.  I mean, everybody could have got hotel rooms here.  Yeah.  I mean, that was offered everybody.  Oh.  It was so funny.  I don't like what Troy's doing right now.  Well, no, no, no. 
[00:53:30]  I mean, I took-  Troy-  I took a nice little beating yesterday, which is fine.  Hold on, hold on.  I deserved it.  You have every right is what I'm saying.  Well, because I'm just listening to everybody.  You and Sal took a-  Everybody sounded so heroic yesterday for coming in.  I was like, okay, cool.  And then I'm thinking to myself, I'm like, oh, Travis and Danny rode in with Anthony in  his SUV.  Like, how is that heroic?  You know what I mean?  Like, and then it's like, okay, shit is going to go down tonight.  How dedicated are you to the show, motherfuckers?  And it's like, oh, we're gone.  Peace.  Troy-  Troy was texting me. 
[00:54:00]  They drove back out to Long Island and-  And he goes, wait.  And that kid could have his neighborhood.  They went back to Long Island.  I was like, yeah.  And he goes, and Eric went back to Jersey?  I was like, yeah.  And he goes, the storm's coming tonight, right?  I go, yeah.  He goes, well, where the fuck is their dedication?  Yeah.  I mean, it's fine.  And I should have been in yesterday.  I deserve more than I got yesterday.  But it's like, well, you guys knew the shit was coming.  Like, what didn't you?  In the end, Sal and Troy made it in the top of the two days.  Yes.  Well, I mean, I honestly, I did feel bad. 
[00:54:30]  I mean, I should have gone out.  I mean, it was, I did try to get a car service.  Rob Cross offers.  See, the thing is, is they make you put everything on your credit card and then they take, they  do reimburse you, but it does take a while to get reimbursed.  Yeah.  It's not a, not a good situation.  And then they don't ever pay the credit, the interest and whatnot.  So it's fine, whatever.  But so, but Rob was like, I will pay for your car.  No problem.  Just, you know, do it.  And I couldn't book anything.  And then I was like, okay, well then I guess, you know, I just, I'm not going to go in.  Then I told everybody I'm not going to be able to make it in.  And then, uh, you know, I did feel bad about not trying to go out and find a taxi, but, you 
[00:55:00]  know, so I was like, all right, I'm going to make it in tomorrow.  No, no fucking problem.  I can't be mad at Troy.  Cause I follow him on Instagram, the pictures he has up there.  I want to hang out on, on the Lower East Side.  Oh dude, you should, there's some crazies.  I want to take a tour.  I love the crazies you're finding.  Dude, come on down, man.  That's gold for me and my stupid camera.  You'd get a lot, man.  There's, there's been some real fucking.  All right.  I'm coming down there soon.  There was a guy in, uh, Astor Place that was just, he had the helmet on and he had the  fake chicken in his hand.  Yeah.  Oh, I saw that picture. 
[00:55:30]  And he's screaming.  Like on the top of.  Why don't you take a video of these guys?  I don't, you know, I don't know.  I guess I probably could, but.  Give it to me, I'll make something out of it.  Yeah, I should.  I don't know.  I just have the video on my phone.  I don't have any, a real good video camera.  Oh, all right.  Well.  But, uh, yeah.  And then he just freezes and you're just like, what the hell is going on?  Right.  And there's guys walking around in robes without shoes on.  I know.  I know.  It's, uh, it's actually quite hysterical.  Ooh, a lot of food has arrived.  All right.  Oh.  We'll take a, we'll take a break.  Oh, thank you.  BLT. 
[00:56:00]  Nice.  You guys found BLTs.  We got ladies here.  Yeah.  But Sam makes a good point.  I really feel like.  There's nothing going on for us.  Yeah.  I definitely have a little guilt.  Although I will say.  Because I thought at least, at the very worst, I would have to like walk down from my apartment.  I figured the elevators wouldn't be running this morning.  Nah.  Not only were they running, I pushed a button.  It was right there waiting for me.  Yeah.  Right down.  The real, the real tragedy of the storm.  We had to go around one tree really.  That was it. 
[00:56:30]  The real tragedy of the storm is what Troy hit the nail on the head.  If, you know, Gary doesn't get these expense reports filled out ASAP because my hotel had  to be upgraded last night.  So, we're sitting pretty right there across the street from the studio.  Why didn't you storm chase with us yesterday?  I put the word out to you.  Because.  Jess was already, I mean, everybody picked up on it when she was on the after show.  Jess was already annoyed that she's stuck in the city.  Right.  Because she wants to be at home.  Right.  Is she a home buddy?  Yeah.  I mean, she would rather, but she doesn't want to be at home alone.  She's one of those people that needs to be in her own bed.  She would rather the two of us be just riding this out in our apartment with the cat and, 
[00:57:00]  you know, our family right there and everything.  Can I tell you the other side of that?  Mm-hmm.  I want to sleep on the street, but I know if I did it, my wife would go, you are crazy.  Why would you want to sleep on the street?  Just to check it out.  It's not good.  Especially in the summer.  I have a desire to, like, fucking wander around all night and put my head down somewhere.  Just to experience it.  Yeah.  No, it wouldn't be fun.  You know where people on the street want to sleep?  Yeah.  Beds.  In your house.  Beds.  I'm not saying every night.  I want to stay in your house.  It's better than mine.  Yeah.  I'm not saying every night, but every once in a while I get the urge, like, that would 
[00:57:30]  be kind of cool.  No, it wouldn't.  I'm not a homebody.  I need to be out of my apartment constantly.  Yeah.  But anyway, so she's sort of more of a homebody, which there's nothing wrong with it.  And she was annoyed that, because we've been here, like, I came in at two o'clock on Sunday  to do my Sunday show.  Right.  We haven't left.  So she really wasn't planning on this being this much of a trip.  She's wearing the same clothes too, right?  We're on our last outfits.  I think that's what she was wearing yesterday.  She's changed her shirt. 
[00:58:00]  She's got the same pants.  Same underwear?  But she changed her shirt.  And underpants, obviously.  She's got new underpants.  You have fresh underpants?  This is my last.  Both of our, we're on our last set of underpants.  Oh.  We might have to expense some new outfits.  You didn't get to the point where you had to wash your underwear in the sink?  No.  I once did that.  Oh, why would you bring that up?  I'm just going to see if I can get Gary to pay for some new outfits for us.  He's going to tell us to wash our underwear in the sink.  Or go commando.  Instead of going to CVS or whatever the fuck it was 11 years ago, I was staying in a hotel 
[00:58:30]  in Manhattan after we signed a really big radio contract.  It was in the Borat Hotel, the Wellington.  Yeah.  And I actually could see either the, I forget now, but either the W or the E right outside  my window just blaring in.  And even with the shades down, that stupid W or E is just so bright, you can't sleep.  It's a horrendous hotel.  But when I was trying to get a hotel room after we were celebrating the signing of the  new contract, the whole town was sold out for whatever reason.  I don't know what was going on.  But I found a room there, and it was horrendous. 
[00:59:00]  And then I'm washing, because I don't have underwear for the next day, I'm washing it in  the sink in the hotel room.  And then I put it on the hot radiator.  You can't find it.  To dry.  And then it was all crusty and hard.  The underwear didn't even move in the morning when I put them back on.  You just signed a fat new contract.  It was fat.  You won't go out and buy some new clothes?  I was lazy.  Why not just go without underwear?  Or wear the same underwear twice?  Oh.  Were they bad?  Oh, God, yeah.  Really?  I had something going on.  Swamp ass or something. 
[00:59:30]  Speaking of terrible hotels.  And I washed my socks, too.  And then this was when we didn't know about bed bugs, so I'm sure I was getting bit to  shit in that bed.  We walked by, when we were exploring Times Square yesterday, because it was empty, we  walked by the Carter Hotel.  Yeah.  There's no vacancy there.  It is full.  Really?  There's tons of, I felt bad for all.  Yeah, because it's so close to Times Square and so convenient, people don't know how bad  of a shithole it is.  It's horrible.  And they could probably sue us for saying that, but it's... 
[01:00:00]  It appears to be horrible from the videos.  My opinion is...  Thank you.  My opinion is it's a shithole.  Yeah, it appears to be the worst hotel in New York.  Okay.  It appears to be.  You can say a hotel's a shithole.  I think it's been voted worst hotel over the years.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what the internet says.  So Jess just wanted you in the hotel room?  Yeah.  Well, I just didn't ask her to go storm chasing, because it was like, she was already like,  are you serious?  And then I turned on wrestling last night, because it was Monday, and she was like, what  the fuck are you doing?  Like, you're making me... 
[01:00:30]  You've trapped me in New York City, because we're hearing the news reports that every  road that leads to Westchester is wiped out.  Don't tell her to go watch a movie or something.  We're hanging out.  You hang out all the time.  Yeah, why didn't you put on something else, though?  We enjoy each other, because it's Monday.  Well, it's not hanging out if you're putting on the show you want.  Yeah, we're hanging out, we're watching...  I'm like, oh, what's a Ryback?  You put on a show you both want.  And she's like, I don't want a Ryback.  Or you sacrifice and put on her show.  What's Ryback?  Ryback?  Yeah, he's one of the guys.  Yeah, he's a new main event talent in WWE. 
[01:01:00]  He doesn't have what it takes.  I don't know.  Yeah, you're right.  You don't know that.  He could not defeat CM Punk.  But yeah, so, I mean, she wasn't...  She wasn't...  I wasn't going to be asking her to go storm chasing.  No.  She wasn't invited.  Dude, look at the amount on Fox.  She wouldn't come.  If I was going to come, she was going to come.  I swear to you, she wasn't invited.  I don't have enough seats in my storm trooping fucking vehicle.  Well, why would I leave my wife?  Dude, look at the amount...  Because people leave their wives sometimes.  They go and do something by themselves.  In a hotel room in the middle of a storm? 
[01:01:30]  Look at the amount of fucking...  You can't see the end of the crane because of the way they have so many graphics on the  fucking Fox.  Yeah, Fox Business.  It looks like a normal crane because the part that's dangling, you can't see the dangle.  You can't see the tip of the dangle.  Or they see your picture.  You wouldn't want his wife to go storm chasing with you?  No.  I wouldn't leave...  And I love his wife.  I wouldn't leave my wife in a hotel by herself.  I didn't invite my wife to go storm trooping.  You left her in her house.  You live in the city.  Yeah.  She's stuck in a hotel.  A hotel's cool. 
[01:02:00]  For what?  This is what I've learned in the last couple of days.  People don't think hotels are cool.  Why didn't you bring...  Why didn't you just pick up...  You could have picked up Sam and Jess and then brought Jess to your house.  Oh, yeah, man.  And then let her hang out with Flint.  You didn't offer that.  He's not...  I probably should offer that.  He's not a nice guy like that.  No, in all fairness, I probably should offer that.  A minute ago...  But she did not get the big invite for the storm trooping.  A minute ago, you're sitting there...  I knew Roland would be all in.  I pick him up on the corner.  He's just wearing a t-shirt.  Well, because he bought seven pounds of lunch meat and no raincoat. 
[01:02:30]  So, Roland's just on the corner waiting for me.  It's already raining pretty hard.  And he's just on his phone in a t-shirt just waiting for me.  I'm like, how bad is a storm if Roland's, like, dressed like that?  You just said that you can't stay in your apartment, that you need to get out and explore  and whatever.  And then in the next sentence, you're saying, why wouldn't you leave your wife alone in  a hotel room during a storm?  Yeah, but I established already...  That hotels are cool?  That she's a homebody.  So, she would be cool just chilling and being in the hotel. 
[01:03:00]  No, she wouldn't.  She could fucking put on a rom-com.  Or a movie, yeah.  Me and you rolling Jim Norton, a storm trooper, and her ass is off.  You go back all nice as the credits are rolling, and then you guys could have a nice night  together.  She doesn't want to sit in a hotel by herself watching a movie.  Number two...  Why?  Those movies are $18 in that room.  That's not going to happen.  You got a free room!  Yeah, but Gare Bear's not going to pay $18 for a movie.  You never do that weird math in your head, huh?  When I know I got something for free, then I get a little extra on the side. 
[01:03:30]  Or something.  I might get a little room service, might do the minibar, might fucking rent a couple movies  knowing that, you know, most of this shit is free.  Plus, Chisler, you know that she's here and she doesn't want to be, so you let her get  a movie because it's like, ah, you know what?  I got to bite the bullet on this one.  And then, thus, then, you would have been able to stormtroop.  No.  You fucking step up and go, you know what?  It's $18, but you know, sweetie, you fucking deserve it.  You're stuck in Manhattan.  So, you watch whatever you want, go in the minibar, get a few snacks, and I'll be back.  I'm going to be with the men stormtrooping. 
[01:04:00]  She wouldn't enjoy watching a movie by herself while I go hang out in stormtroop.  Well, girls got to learn how to do shit on their own.  But there's nothing for her to do here.  It's the middle of a storm.  She doesn't have access to any-  Hotel room, rom-com, minibar.  Okay, now you're talking about more dollars.  Troy, help me out here.  No, I agree.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You just said you wanted to sleep on the street, and now you think it's fun to sit alone in  a hotel room watching a rom-com.  No, I think you could have presented it like, hey, look, something viral may happen. 
[01:04:30]  I need to be out there, you know, with- I need a follow-up to my viral video.  I need to get out there and see what's going on.  That's how you could have presented it to Jess.  And Jess is- look, Jess is a fucking huge trooper.  Yeah, she is.  That's why she's stuck in New York City, because I'm like, look, I have to be here for the show.  I think you were too scared to get into the stormtrooping vehicle with us.  I don't care about a stormtrooping vehicle.  I was walking around stormtrooping on my own.  No, you weren't.  You were up there safe and fun, and all the tourists were frolicking.  There were no tourists.  We weren't even the shit. 
[01:05:00]  We weren't even sure we could go down certain roads.  Tell them, Roland.  And the car swerved.  Car swerved in front of us.  All right.  I got it.  The terrifying story of the time a branch hit your car.  We all heard your stormtrooping.  I don't know if it was a branch.  I have no idea what hit my car.  A thick branch.  I'm still trying to figure that out.  Hold on.  The storm wants to talk.  I think he was busy fucking.  I'm suspicious.  I think Sam might be scared of a little inclement weather.  I'm not scared of inclement weather.  I'm a person who actually cares about my wife and making sure she has a good time. 
[01:05:30]  I care about my wife.  I left her there with two kids.  Two little kids.  Two and a half year old and a three week old.  I said, I'll be right back.  I'm stormtrooping with the boys.  I'm stormtrooping.  Did I look like a stormtrooper, Roland?  It's not when you had your glasses on and you were driving.  Oh, you saw my glasses?  You didn't look very stormtrooper.  I hate those glasses, but I need them now.  Awkward.  I got to take a picture of me and my glasses.  No.  A decent human being.  No, they're okay. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, for a radio shot guy, they're not very good.  But, I mean, if you work in a library.  The stupid lady at the store said I look good in them.  Of course she did.  It probably says that to every fucking person.  That's what she does.  They're probably shitty frames they can't fucking sell.  So they go, ah, put these on this idiot.  Yeah, when I went.  They tell me it looks good.  And got my eyes tested to get glasses for, like, when it's raining while I'm driving.  Yeah.  And the hot girls that work at the glasses store convinced me to get $400 frames because apparently it looks good on me.  And do you wear them?  No.  I knew immediately it was a terrible idea. 
[01:06:30]  They had tricked me again.  Well, I got tricked.  Yeah.  And I'm learning today that obviously I don't look good.  So I'm going home and I'm fucking getting rid of those glasses.  It looks like reading glasses while you're driving.  Oh.  Yeah.  You should step on them.  While you're stormtrooping.  Yeah.  Wow.  I really miss an exciting stormtrooping.  Wait, man.  I need better fucking glasses for my stormtrooping.  Yeah.  I got to look more of the part.  Yeah.  A decent human being does not leave his wife stranded on an island and then throw her in  a hotel room and say, I'm off to do some fun stuff.  Jimmy learned something yesterday. 
[01:07:00]  What?  Because I make fun of his celebrity photo obsession.  And I think he learned yesterday that that's my thing.  Viral videos?  No.  You felt the excitement, right?  I did.  It was exciting.  I'm really into that type of shit.  But can I correct Sam?  I think he's a nice guy because he stayed with his wife.  A nice guy doesn't make his wife stay in a hotel and then watch wrestling.  Yeah.  See, that's where you blew it.  Yeah.  We watched it together.  She hates it.  We flipped back and forth some storm coverage.  A little more Monday Night Raw.  During the commercial breaks.  So she gets, what?  Four minutes? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Plus she got a little...  You get a 20-minute block.  She gets four.  She's reading her book.  You know.  We're all having a great time together.  I'm suspicious.  I think you're scared of fucking when the weather gets extreme.  Yeah, he was.  He was holed up.  I'm suspicious.  And I think you're blaming your wife.  If I was scared of when the weather gets extreme...  You're making everyone think you're just a nice guy, but I'm very suspicious right  now, Sam Roberts.  If I was scared of bad weather, I would have pulled a sal and been like, what do you want  me to do?  I'm stuck in Westchester.  And I wouldn't have left.  You got in here nice on Sunday, which is suspicious too, when it was still nice and sunny. 
[01:08:00]  Well, I had to do a show.  Oh.  Yeah.  I was doing my radio show.  Yeah.  I'm suspicious.  Something's going on.  And then Gary was like...  You should have been stormtrooping, man.  All right.  Maybe I had baby seats in my stormtrooping vehicle.  Right.  With your nana glasses.  With my nana glasses.  But we still were stormtrooping.  I messed up one picture too.  Huh?  I messed up the picture with you and Jimmy.  Which one?  Yes.  It's a video.  Well, that's why I put it on the end of the jet skiing video.  Because it's so stupid.  It's me and Jimmy waiting for Roland to take our pictures. 
[01:08:30]  And it's just a three second video of us with our arms around each other.  Looks like we're queer and off.  I know.  I know.  And you're not doing extreme stuff.  You're trying to find other people doing extreme stuff so you can tape them.  We were extreme.  No.  Yeah.  Tell them, Roland.  We would drive around alleys where the trees look like they're about to fall.  Yep.  Yep.  And I stopped in the middle of the fucking street.  I stand corrected.  Jumped out of my car and said I was depressed and took a picture of a tree that fell down.  With your cell phone.  With my cell phone.  With your press phone.  I did take a good picture too of a magazine, one of those little magazine dispensers that apparently 
[01:09:00]  the wind had knocked over.  Just tipped it over a little bit.  Sure.  Somebody could fall on that.  Oh, wow.  Look.  Bay, but we do have a hard time at 9 o'clock.  We were right there.  So is that chick.  Yeah, see?  That's what we were.  She's not an adventurer.  She's an idiot.  She's after the fact.  That's where all the stormtroopers go.  You guys were before the fact.  That tree could have fallen on me right there.  See?  We were there.  She's after the fact.  You were before the fact.  You said yourself you had to leave before it got bad.  We were right where she's standing and that tree that fell is a mere 30 feet behind her. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Thank God you left before the storm came.  Well.  No, not really.  Yes.  It was there though.  No, man.  I'm telling you.  We were one of the last vehicles on the road.  Stormtrooper vehicle?  My whole thing was, the only thing I said was, I got to get home before it gets dark because  that's when it gets crazy because you don't know what the fuck's out there.  The cops were circling to you.  And they were circling because it looked like they were going to close down the West Side  Highway.  But no, man.  We were in the shit.  Well, I was enjoying room service with my beautiful wife. 
[01:10:00]  You could have been stormtrooping.  What did you have?  Actually, if I remember correctly, I believe I ordered the chicken, fingers, and fries.  What did she have?  I don't remember.  Did you tell her to only order something inexpensive?  No, because throw the bill on old Gare Bear and he'll take care of it.  Yeah, but what about the $18 movie?  What about the $18 movie?  Well, the company's not going to pay for a movie.  So then you fucking splurge.  Get the $18 movie.  No, I mean.  Troy, what do you think of this? 
[01:10:30]  He should have stormtrooped, right?  I mean, I think he should have gone out.  I think he should have gone out.  Because he could have found a good video.  I went to Times Square.  Plus, I'm not that guy.  We were all just hanging out.  We were having a good time.  We were laughing.  It looked like fun.  It was fun.  Yeah.  And then if he didn't get a picture of the crane, people spin around and go back again.  Yeah, man.  And I was spinning around making sure we got all the angles.  I don't need to get.  Everybody's got pictures of that crane.  I don't need to.  I'm not the guy who goes and like videotapes crazy stuff.  We were early, man.  We were there probably within a half hour of that thing fucking doing its tip over. 
[01:11:00]  I mean, I would have.  Which, by the way, I predicted on yesterday's show.  And if E-Rock was here, he certainly would not have found that clip.  No, no.  But everyone pointed out on Twitter, I predicted that the crane would go.  I would have liked to do some interviews and stuff, but I didn't have the equipment.  Well, we were stupid.  We should have done a chip video.  I didn't think.  Although I did mention crane yesterday.  I mentioned crane yesterday.  You called it.  I mentioned it.  Or did you mention it?  I did.  Do you get the credit?  No.  It doesn't matter.  It didn't fall.  Imagine being in the crane on the Freedom Tower. 
[01:11:30]  How scary that would be.  We saw the crane on the Freedom Tower.  That thing was hunkered down.  That thing wasn't moving.  Do you see the water flying into the Freedom Tower construction site?  Like the waterfalls?  Not at all.  We were stormtrooping.  Yeah.  While you were fucking scared in a hotel room in Times Square.  I wasn't scared at all.  We were in the shit.  Not allowing your lovely wife to watch a rom-com.  We watched a Paul Rudd movie, too.  On her laptop.  Paul Rudd stinks.  The one with Jennifer Aniston.  She just got one on the TV. 
[01:12:00]  Paul Rudd has wrecked so many fucking comedies.  I can't even count that high.  He always has the one improv scene in the movie where he's like.  Oh, it's horrendous.  Just riffing the whole time.  And you could tell it's just put in there.  Name one movie where he was funny.  Paul Rudd.  Go.  I Love You, Man.  I liked I Love You, Man.  The bromance movie.  He wasn't bad in that.  But he played more the straight man.  Yes.  But I guess that's his role, mostly.  Oh, good call.  He was good in I Love You, Man.  Yeah, he wasn't a 40-year-old virgin. 
[01:12:30]  He was not the strong player in that.  No, of course not.  Was he in Anchorman, too?  He was in Anchorman.  He was not the strong player in Anchorman.  Of course not.  Keep going.  Let's see.  He was in that other horrendous movie.  Which one?  Exactly.  Yeah.  He was in Clueless.  He was good in Clueless when he was younger.  Yeah.  He played Josh.  All right.  We should break.  But the stormtrooping was phenomenal yesterday.  It was fine.  It was phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  We went down to Battery Park.  That ended up underwater.  Yeah, before.  We saw the Battery Park tunnel that's now flooded out. 
[01:13:00]  You came back, and the big deal was that your car got hit by a branch.  I don't know what hit it.  It was.  It was.  We don't know what hit it.  It was a loud branch.  No, it scared the shit out of us.  Yeah, exactly.  You guys are Freddy cats.  I wouldn't have been scared if I were in the car.  Let's see.  We're driving around in my stormtrooping vehicle.  You're in a hotel room, and we're scared.  Your stormtrooping vehicle has a baby seat, and you're wearing Nana glasses.  Two baby seats.  Two baby seats.  Which made it a little tight for Roland in the back seat.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Because I told Roland, get out of the fucking shotgun.  Jimmy's coming.  We had to go get Jimmy.  I didn't give a fuck.  You didn't?  Fuck, no, man.  Weren't you, Chip, weren't you worried about, like, a tree falling or anything?  I didn't give a fuck.  I was just throwing that fucking thing.  Oh, no.  Looks like we're going home, because I don't think that's a good fucking noise.  Do you hear that, Sal?  You hear that in there, right?  I have no idea what the fuck it is.  Is that just a pitter-patter of my heart?  Jimmy has a crush on someone.  Everything's fucked up, too. 
[01:14:00]  Huh?  The dilette machine isn't working at all.  Is it working yet, Sal?  Why does that shit go out?  But isn't it a satellite?  It's in D.C.  But isn't it a satellite?  But if D.C. goes down, we're down.  Did D.C. go down?  I guess so.  I mean, the storm hit D.C. bad.  Huh.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  So, I mean, that's where the main thing is.  So, if that's not sending out a...  Well, we should take a break and figure out where the storm hit bad.  We don't really have any bits to play today.  I know.  We have nothing.  Because dilette's...  I thought...  I love doing phones. 
[01:14:30]  I'm like, all right, at the very worst, I'll just fucking talk to the people.  But we can't even do that.  Yeah, no.  Unless you...  You know what you could do?  We could read tweets.  Give out your personal cell phone number and we'll throw it on speaker.  I was kind of thinking that.  You should.  I really was.  Give out your personal cell and then get a new one.  I used to have a work phone.  I don't have that number.  You have a work phone.  I don't have that phone, actually.  Yeah.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Maybe we'll just read fucking Twitter or something.  That's not a good tease.  Huh?  That's not a good tease.  That's not going to keep people tuned in. 
[01:15:00]  We're going to do some crazy shit when we get back.  The storm is going nuts.  Is it?  The mics might go...  Yeah, it's going crazy.  You got to stay here for your updates.  We'll do a storm update.  The mics are...  People like storm updates.  The mics are Tud Thumping.  Yeah, I don't know what that is.  What's Tud Thumping?  That's a great character name.  That's...  I think Tud Thumping was the name of that Chumbawamba song.  Tub Thumping.  Oh, Tub Thumping.  Dope.  You didn't even know what it was.  Yeah, but I know...  If you said Tub Thumping, I would have said that's got something to do with a tub.  Tud Thumping. 
[01:15:30]  It stars in.  It doesn't have anything to do with a tub.  It doesn't have anything to do with a tub.  It doesn't have anything to do with a tub.  Storm chasing.  My sister just...  Storm trooping.  It's what you did.  My sister just checked in from Long Island.  Many, many, many trees blocking most roads.  Where she lives is inland.  So I can't imagine, she says, the severe damage by towns on the coast.  What are some of the coast towns?  Oh, it's the whole Jersey Shore.  It got fucking destroyed.  It did, right?  They said they're gonna...  The storm is just readjusting the fucking shoreline itself. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  Beaches that you've been used to your entire life, a bunch of those will be completely  gone or redesigned.  Isn't that wild?  I can tell you what I hope got wiped out of Wildwood.  What?  I'll tell you off the air.  Really?  That's a good tease.  Can I bring it to the air?  No.  Is it the shwuggies?  I don't know what shwuggies are. 
[01:16:30]  Whatever that means.  Anything else, Troy?  You good?  I'm good, man.  I see it.  By the way, Troy...  Let me tell you something.  Troy wanted to leave the studio a half hour ago, but he's just standing there with his  headphones on.  He walks in here.  He comes through the hurricane.  He still looks crisp.  He's still got his sticker on his hat.  He looks good.  He looks like a million bucks.  Do you have a hat sticker?  Oh, yeah.  He's a rock star today, man.  All credit to Troy Klein.  He made it in on the tough day.  And he was.  He's got to work on those easy days.  I was sleeping in my luxurious Times Square king-size hotel bed, and Troy woke me up to 
[01:17:00]  make the announcement that he will be walking in.  If he hadn't found a cab, he would have walked all the way in, and he might have gotten shot.  I'm not going to lie.  It was scary down in the Lower East Side with no power on.  Coming from the guy that wouldn't stormtroop, and not only wouldn't he stormtroop, he doesn't  even write me back.  First of all.  Because he knows I would have gave him shit.  That's not cool, dude.  First of all.  Why don't you write me back, at least?  Well, if I could count the number of texts I've sent you that have gotten no responses.  I'm the big fucking star.  Yeah, but, you know, sometimes we have to-  You have to write back.  We have to- 
[01:17:30]  You have to write back.  Yeah, but I have to assert myself so we can make a relationship of equals at some point.  Are we going to stormtroop today?  It's not stormtroop, by the way.  It's storm chase.  Oh, I like stormtrooper.  You guys keep saying stormtrooper.  I like it that way.  Stormtrooper is somebody from Star Wars.  Well, we're stormtroopers, then.  Stars and stormtroopers?  Go get our Star Wars fucking gear.  We're going back out there.  Yeah.  If you're going out in stormtrooper gear, then I'll go out.  No, this is what I want today.  Okay?  I want some fucking favors.  I want to go underground. 
[01:18:00]  I want to see some water underneath.  Yeah.  And where the fuck are the rats if that water's in the subway?  That's what I was talking to Jess about.  What happens to all the rats that are going to take over?  They know how to survive.  Where the fuck do they go to?  Yeah.  The mainland.  I need some answers.  They're probably hanging out.  I want to go underground today.  How do I get that done?  Like a ninja turtle.  Yeah, I want to do that.  How do we do that?  Or I want to walk through the battery tunnel.  Got to get some swords and shit.  Or get a floaty.  Yeah, you get a floaty.  That's my viral video.  Floating through the battery tunnel.  Yeah, we should get into the sewers and just make a lazy river. 
[01:18:30]  That'd be cool as fuck.  Just going down.  Going down.  I just want to go to bed.  I'm tired.  Why are you...  He's Tucker.  Because he was stormtrooping, you asshole.  You were done stormtrooping by like six o'clock.  I texted Roland.  He was in his hotel room at six.  I'm just out of his sleep.  My wife went out and got shit for cookies.  That was part of the stormtrooping thing.  Yeah, chocolate chip.  What's that?  Chocolate chip.  What's that?  Chocolate chip.  Uh-oh.  What's that?  It's going to be a problem.  Chocolate chip.  What's that? 
[01:19:00]  Chocolate chip.  All right.  We're going to get a storm update next.  I don't know.  We'll fucking figure it out.  We're going to try to get Chris Christie on the phone.  Try to get Bloomberg on the phone.  Yeah.  We can try.  We've got to get the phones first.  Right.  I get Chris Christie's number, but he won't talk to us.  Try to get Giuliani on the phone.  That'd be nice.  Try to get Obama.  I think we got an Obama call coming.  He gave a nice shout-out to Obama, Chris Christie, because Obama called him, too.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So he likes...  Chris Christie likes that kind of leadership.  He's still annoyed at Roland for taking pictures of him snoozing at that Springsteen concert. 
[01:19:30]  No.  So, can we play music at least or something?  I got a bunch of songs loaded.  Yeah, we got some George Carlin bits we could play.  Oh, really?  Remember those days?  Yeah, I do.  What do we got?  Do you have the George Carlin disaster piece?  We probably can't get to it because it's all in the let.  How do you...  Can't you play it on the YouTube?  I'll look up.  Look up George Carlin.  He has a good take on disasters and how he certainly and a lot of people hope for the worst. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Or we can see the hurricane flyers, what we heard about.  What happened?  The guys who fly to the hurricanes to report.  Oh, those guys that go into it on a plane?  Yeah, they're crazy.  Should I say it's like 10 minutes long or so?  That's a little long.  Couldn't you have said it was three minutes and then all of a sudden it goes to 10 and  no one knows the difference?  Just kidding.  It's three minutes.  Oh, it's three minutes?  George Carlin, natural disasters?  Yeah.  I'm tired.  You can't be tired.  We just got started.  Storm tuckered me out.  No, you can't be tired.  I am.  We have a skeleton crew. 
[01:20:30]  We gotta be men.  I was very sleepy when the wind was blowing.  I had to stay up and man the windows.  Are you tuckered out?  Yes, I am.  Why don't we go down to Battery Park and broadcast live?  Everyone else is down there.  My publicist thinks I'm doing a fucking phone-er today at 1230.  She's sadly mistaken.  She's crazy, right?  Yeah.  I'm tired from the storm.  Why don't we get an update from our pals?  Yeah, Joe DeRose on Friday was panicking because he was going to be by himself during  the storm.  How did he do?  He's like that every time he does a show. 
[01:21:00]  See if he can come by.  He's close.  How did Colin Quinn do?  I wanted Colin was in lower Manhattan.  Bobby's in Chicago.  He's stuck.  Well, if any of these guys are listening, I doubt it.  Call Jimmy's phone.  We'll just put him on the air.  We'll do that.  We'll figure out what these guys are doing.  Oh, he's too far away, I guess.  I don't think I'm in.  That's too bad.  Yeah, it sucks.  That's fine.  Yeah, I can't make it, huh?  That's too bad.  It would be great to get a Joe DeRose phone call today. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  All right, we're going to play a little George Carlin.  Maybe the whole thing.  Maybe 30 seconds of it.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And then we're going to get a storm update.  I'll see if I'm here.  She's got to stay.  Okay.  For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature.  Clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, overfishing the oceans,  polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers. 
[01:22:00]  So when nature strikes back and smacks man in the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that.  I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever.  None.  And no matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural or man-made, I always hope it gets worse.  Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you have a part of you, a part of you that secretly hopes everything gets worse? 
[01:22:30]  When you see a big fire on TV, don't you hope it spreads?  Don't you hope it gets completely out of control and burns down six counties?  You don't root for the firemen, do you?  I mean, I don't want them to get hurt or nothing, but I don't want them putting out my fire.  That's my fire.  That's nature showing off and having fun.  I like fires.  You know something else I like? 
[01:23:00]  Those spring floods in the Midwest.  Aren't they great?  Like clockwork.  Spring floods in the Midwest.  But I'm starting to notice, I'm starting to catch on, that every year it's the same story.  Another flood, in the same place, with the same people, on the same river.  Same fucking people!  And these people do not move.  They will not fucking move.  They repaint, put down new carpeting and wallpaper, and they move right back into the same fucking house,  on the flood plain, next to the river, and then they wonder why grandma's floating downstream with the parakeet on her head. 
[01:23:30]  Fourth time.  Again, fourth fucking time.  There's no learning curve with these people.  It's very hard to feel sorry for them.  Every year, same people, same rowboats, out there paddling around, rescuing a chicken.  What the fuck kind of a life is that?  Well, our kids love it here.  Oh, really?  What do they got, gills?  And while they're showing all that shit on the screen, the announcer is saying to me, 
[01:24:00]  It's been raining steadily for three months now.  The ground can't hold any more water.  The river is cresting higher than it has in two centuries.  The levees have washed away.  And I just hope it keeps raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining.  and it rains steadily for five years  and then after that 
[01:24:30]  for ten years it's cloudy  with occasional showers  and the river never returns  to its natural banks  it becomes a completely new river  and the borders of three states  have to be changed  and all the maps and atlases  have to be redrawn and reprinted  and no one's couch  ever completely dries out  for years and years  every time they sit down  there's always a little squish  Dan, Linda, come on in you guys 
[01:25:00]  have a seat, squish, squish  I like that  I'm an interesting guy  I always hope that no matter  how small the original problem is  it's going to grow into bigger and bigger proportions  it's completely out of control  and I'll give you a concrete example  let's say a water main breaks  in downtown Los Angeles  and it floods an electrical substation  knocking out all the traffic lights  and tying up the entire city  and emergency vehicles can't get through  and at the same time  one of those month-long  global warming heat waves  comes along  but there's no air conditioning 
[01:25:30]  there's no water for sanitation  so cholera, smallpox  and dysentery break out  and thousands of people  start dying in the streets  but before they die  parasites eat their brains  and they go completely fucking crazy  and they storm the hospital  but the hospital can't handle  all the casualties  so these people rape all the nurses  and set the hospital on fire  and the flames drive them even crazier  so they start stabbing social workers  and garbage men  and a big wind comes along  and the entire city goes up in flames  and the people who are still healthy  they get mad at the sick people  and they start crucifying them  nailing them to crosses 
[01:26:00]  trying on their underwear  shit like that  then everybody smokes crack in PCP  and they march on city hall  where they burn the mayor at the stake  strangle his wife  and take turns sodomizing  the statue of Larry Flint  and at this point  at this point  it looks like pretty soon  things are going to start  to get out of control  so everybody panics  and tries to leave the city  at the same time  and they trample each other to death  in the streets by the thousands  and wild dogs eat their corpses  and the wild dogs chase  the rest of the people  down the highway  and one by one 
[01:26:30]  the dogs pick off the old fucks  and the slow people  because they're in the fast lane  where they don't belong  get the fuck out of the fast lane  if you're an old fuck  if you're a slow fuck  get over on the right  get over on the right  and then  and the lucky ones  the lucky people  who managed to make it  all the way outside of town  they discover when they get there  that big sparks from the city  have lit the suburbs on fire  and the suburbs burn uncontrollably  and thousands of identical homes  have identical fires  with identical smoke  killing all the identical soccer moms  and their identical kids  named Jason and Jennifer  and now 
[01:27:00]  now the fire spreads to the farmlands  and the farmlands burn intensely  at 425 degrees  creating millions of baked potatoes  and  as the farmlands burn  as the farmlands burn  thousands of barns and farmhouses  begin to explode  from all the hidden  methamphetamine labs  and the meth chemicals  run downhill  into the rivers and streams  where wild animals  drink the water  and get completely geeked on speed  so bears and wolves  amped up on cranks  start roaming the countryside  looking for people to eat  even though they're not really hungry  and the fire spreads to the forest 
[01:27:30]  and the forest burns furiously  and hundreds of elves  and trolls  and fairies  come running out of the woods  screaming  Bambi is dead  Bambi is dead  and he is  he is  finally that fucking little cunt  Bambi is dead  dead  now  now hundreds of regional fires  come together  into one huge interstate inferno  and all 12 of the western United States  are burning out of control  except Utah  where the Mormons don't allow fires  and the fire spreads across the Great Plains 
[01:28:00]  toasting the wheat  cooking the cattle  and producing hamburgers actually  then it leaps to Mississippi  and races through the south  blowing up stills  interrupting lynchings  and killing millions of inbred people  and then  it turns northeast  and it heads for Washington D.C.  where George Bush  can't decide  if it's an emergency or not  he can't decide this  he doesn't know  it's hard  oh it's hard work  you know  no  he can't decide 
[01:28:30]  because Dick Cheney  is in prison  so  instead he takes a nap  he takes a nap  he puts his empty  fucking brainless head  down on the little pillow  his mother gave him at Christmas time  and he takes a fucking nap  so the fire moves to Philadelphia  but it's a weekend  and Philadelphia's closed  on the weekend  so the fire moves to New York City  and the people in New York  tell the fire to go  fuck itself  go fuck yourself  yeah  and it does  yeah  and it does 
[01:29:00]  so instead  it burns down  Long Island and Connecticut  killing all the rich  white assholes  and completely destroying  their evil faggotty golf courses  and while all this is going on  Canada burns to the ground  but nobody notices  and now the entire  North American continent  is on fire  producing a huge thermal updraft  and creating an incendiary  cyclonic macro system  that forms a hemispheric megastorm  breaking down the molecular structure  of the atmosphere  and actually changing  the laws of nature  fire and water combine 
[01:29:30]  burning clouds of flaming rain  fall upward  gamma rays and solar winds  ignite the ionosphere  creating huge clouds  of ionized plasma  bolts of lightning  20 million miles long  begin shooting out of the North Pole  and the sky fills up  with green shit  and then suddenly  the entire fabric  of space time  splits in two  a huge crack  in the universe opens  and all the dead people  from the past  begin falling through  Babe Ruth  Groucho Marx  Davy Crockett  Tiny Tim  Porky Pig  Hitler  Janis Joplin 
[01:30:00]  Alan Ludden  my Uncle Dave  your Uncle Dave  everybody's Uncle Dave  an endless stream  of dead Uncle Daves  falling through the crack  and all the dead  Uncle Dave's  gather around  a heavenly kitchen table  they light up cigarettes  and they begin to talk  they talk about  how they never got a break  how their parents  didn't love them  and their children  were ungrateful  they talk about  how the government  screwed them out of money  and they just missed out  on a big job  they say the Jews  own everything  and the blacks  get special treatment  and all the hatred  and bitterness  drips out of these people 
[01:30:30]  and forms a big pool  of liquid hate  and the pool  of liquid hate  begins to spin  round and round  it spins  faster and faster  and the faster it spins  the bigger it gets  faster and faster  bigger and bigger  until the whirling pool  of hate  is bigger than  the entire universe  and then suddenly  it explodes  into trillions  of tiny stars  and every star  has a trillion planets  and every planet  has a trillion  Uncle Daves  and all the Uncle Daves  have good jobs  perfect eyesight  and shoes that fit  they have great sex lives  and free health care 
[01:31:00]  they understand the internet  their kids think  they're cool  and they all love  their neighbors  and every week  without fail  Uncle Dave  wins the lottery  forever and ever  till the end of time  every single Uncle Dave  has a winning ticket  and Uncle Dave  is finally happy  now do you see  why I like it  when nature  gets even  with humans  thanks for coming  in here  The O.P. and Anthony Show  on Sirius XM  Sirius XM 
[01:31:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show  All right  we're back  it's me and  Jim Norton today  we got Sam Roberts  we got the Troy Kwan  we got Sal  and who am I missing  Roland  Roland is here  that's it  and stuck on Long Island 
[01:32:00]  yes  Travis and Daddy  were staying with him  because they had to  leave their houses  right  so they're all stuck  on Long Island  with trees down everywhere  my sister wrote  and said  the fucking  trees are down  everywhere  that's what happens  on Long Island  what's wrong  getting an update  no it's just crazy  that's the one thing  that's good about the city  not having any trees  yeah the power lines  aren't going to be  you'll have  power out  but not because of that  yeah we also learned  that Sam  doesn't have what it takes  to be a stormtrooper  like me  Jim Norton  and Roland 
[01:32:30]  you're like  wealthy stormtroopers  how am I a wealthy  stormtrooper  you're just driving around  before the storm hits  and taking pictures  of guys on jet skis  that's not stormtrooping  how many cars  were on the road  Jim Norton  not many  maybe 10 cars  in all of Manhattan  guess what  my stormtrooping vehicle  was one of them  but what did you accomplish  I got in a cool jet ski video  me and Jimmy laughed  bunch of knowledge  bunch of knowledge  you learned about  nature  we saw these other  stormtroopers on their phones  just texting  and checking their Twitters 
[01:33:00]  and then going on camera  making believe it was worse  than it was at the time  because obviously  we got walloped  I have a wife  that's not terribly happy  to still be here  so I have to entertain her  but why can't she  entertain herself  yeah  because she's stuck  in a hotel  and I'm not  trashing your wife  by the way  because it's a common thread  with a lot of people  why can't  why do the  why do women need us  to entertain them  well no  guess what  I'm entertaining myself  right now  and when I was  stormtrooping yesterday  I was entertaining myself  I wasn't like  oh man  I wish my wife was around 
[01:33:30]  so she could tell me  what to do right now  no  we are  but there's a lot of women  like that  but we enjoy each other's company  so it's like  I love my wife  I enjoy her company  more than anyone's  but it's like  I'm not going to go  hang out with my friends  she doesn't have any friends here  neither do you  well then why were you guys  so eager to have me  come stormtrooping  I didn't  I didn't care if you trooped  you would have wanted me there  I didn't care if you stormtrooped  or not  you would have preferred I came  I wouldn't have  he didn't really care  he wanted me to come  he enjoys me  Jim enjoys my company  he didn't even care  I'm stormtrooping 
[01:34:00]  it's all business  that's right  time for friendship  Jimmy was stormtrooping so bad  that he almost lost  his fucking cup of coffee  he held the whole time  I noticed that  I know  okay that's  I'm so glad you brought that up  because you guys are taking a picture  in this storm  yeah  and you're there  wait were we in the storm  where  well  it was pre-storm  no  we were in the storm  and where were you  the weather channel was there  CNN was there  NBC New York  and you're Battery Park right  yeah  yeah  and the picture 
[01:34:30]  that was where everyone goes  when these storms hit  I knew  did I know Jimmy  yes  I went right to the area  where I knew all the trucks would be  the picture of you guys  in Battery Park though  which where  they could see that on  I guess  either  I can't remember if it's not Sam  or OP Radio on Twitter  you motherfucker  I guess OP Radio  but not  you've learned well sir  you've learned well  Jim  it's on OP Radio  Jim is  holding his like  lawyer coffee mug  the whole time  that's right  what happened was  what's the lawyer coffee mug  I'll tell you 
[01:35:00]  it's a Starbucks  I got the call  to do a little stormtrooping  and I said  because  Roland and Oppie  were coming  back  Roland  texted me  from Oppie's  phone  and said  that we're gonna be  10 minutes  because we're coming  from Battery Park  so I had 10 minutes  to kill  so I said  what am I gonna do  for 10 minutes  stretched  and I said  I want some coffee  I had napped  so I woke up  from my nap 
[01:35:30]  where'd you get the coffee  I made it  and I brought it  in my thing  well why would you  make the Obster cup  I didn't even think of it  I just was literally  gonna have a  same reason he didn't  call his parents  who are out in Jersey  oh no  oh bitch  that's a good point  I forgot they were there  I would've got you a coffee  I wasn't thinking  I would've thought of you  and your feelings  well I only had one cup  to bring it in  look at the picture man  I'm trying to hold on  because I feel like  I'm gonna be blown  into the river at that point  yeah but the storm  isn't even bad enough  for Jim to break  chip character  it's not that bad  yeah but I was holding  I have a napkin 
[01:36:00]  too around my coffee  so in case I spill  some on my hands  yeah I noticed  he wasn't being chip  he was cold from the winds  I noticed that  that's his wind face  he's got his coffee  napkin on  so his little fingers  don't burn  holding the hot beverage  I don't like them  getting sticky  oh look man  you know  stormtrooping's tough  and if you can get  a cup of coffee  what's wrong with that  who wants to stormtroop  with sticky fingers  anyway  I was waking up  I had napped  and I thought everything  would be closed  and I needed a coffee  to just get my engine  revving for some  stormtrooping  thank you Jimmy  look at that  Statue of Liberty  right in the background 
[01:36:30]  I was stormtrooping  trooping?  yes  oh  trooping  yes stormtrooping  and I didn't feel  any giant sense  of loss  after I realized  what had happened  don't put your hand  on your chest  like that  it's very effeminate  Sam has the hand  splayed on the chest  that's my Helen Bergeron  hand  yeah it's perfect  thank you Kenny  how's the streets  it's really just  quiet out there right  yeah it's like  a ghost town  it's a little drizzle  yeah  what  it's okay  what are you gonna do 
[01:37:00]  tonight  are you gonna go home  and come back tomorrow  why don't you mind  your business  yeah  I didn't realize  that was an inappropriate  question  but  you know  I'm not the one  talking about  you know  you can't leave  your hotel room  because you're  fucking all night  that's not what I said  and we did leave  the hotel room  but we did so together  as Opie said  he decided not to  invite my wife  stormtrooping  you're so close  to having his  and her shirts  yeah you really are  guys won't get it  over with  but both of them  this is hers  yeah  you should have been  stormtrooping  fast forward  five to ten years  you guys will be  like having 
[01:37:30]  the same outfits on  yeah  you'll be that couple  you'll be that couple  Jess and I like each other  very much  we like each other  very much  yeah  that's right  but you're not allowed  to do things by yourself  we are  I'm allowed to  but  you sure  I've dragged her  into the city  he said like each other  he didn't say love  that's true  there's a lot of love  between Jess and I  and that's obvious  to anybody  who's met the two of us  how much love  did you give to her  in the hotel  they're asking about  having sex in the hotel room  no he said love  he meant sex though  he kept it  he kept it classy  he's talking about 
[01:38:00]  fornicating  anyway  you can't help it  in that luxury  hotel room  her panties get moist  I guess so  sure  sure that  I even got uncomfortable  with that one  fucking catty  that's quite frankly  none of your business  she probably is not  going to enjoy  this line of conversation  no I mean  she's in the office  she's not even like  she's like  maybe at home  what is she doing  office work or something  no she's down there  with Troy's hot chick  what are they doing  I don't know  hopefully something good 
[01:38:30]  like what  if you know what I mean  I don't  lesson out  can I get in trouble  for not having a suit on today  I don't know  it's a fucking  state of emergency  he's got his  Chris Christie  zip up on  yeah  his Bloomberg zip up  he might have  got a talking to  because he wasn't  dressed properly  yeah I was asked  how come  I'm not wearing a suit  who asked you  yesterday  oh  an executive 
[01:39:00]  he was one of the  ten people that  showed up  and then they're  busting his balls  over a fucking  suit jacket  the executives  aren't here today  by the way  what really  all the heroic  executives  that were here  yesterday  I haven't seen  one of them  I don't blame them  so this is a free day  right  yeah  I'm taking this day  another day  you get double time  for today  I'm taking this day  another day  if that makes sense  I get it  so you take  this should be a vacation  you're working  you get an extra day  I get an extra day  now we're back  on the same page  Sam Roberts  good  maybe that day  we can go stormtrooping  no  you're not going to be 
[01:39:30]  invited on the next one  I'm sorry  that's not cool  well you didn't come  stormtrooping  when you were offered  I'm saying it like that  it's true  it's you know  he didn't want to  come trooping with us  Jimmy's tuckered out  I'm like no  Jimmy not today  you can't be tuckered out  the storm makes me  very sleepy  whenever I hear wind  I want to doze off  but we have nothing today  we just have each other  we gotta get through this  we have no phones  we can't really do prep  yeah there's no prep  there's nothing going on  in the news 
[01:40:00]  Sam can talk about  his sex life  what he is so  wrapped up about  my sex life for  what else are you  going to talk about  they're saying  what about your sex life  how's that going  there's nothing to talk about  we've talked about it  non-existent  alright  we got bullet points  so far we got  six people killed  from the storm  two in Queens  three in Westchester  due to trees falling  falling tree  god I hate this one  you get one of these  every fucking time  a person electrocuted 
[01:40:30]  stepping into a puddle  yeah  oh no  13 deaths total  excuse me  that's all just New York  I think there's sex  what if you're in a  like say your apartment's flooded  and you're in there  or your house  and like all the power's off  and then the power goes on  will you automatically  get electrocuted  because you're in the water  or will it be so much water  that the electricity  won't go in there  in what  the bathtub  no say you're standing  in your basement  and your basement's flooded  oh I don't know  that could be a problem  and your power's out  I called Dr. Kaku  yeah I don't know  the power 
[01:41:00]  would burn you  like crispy cookie people  no dry land  in the Rockaways  Brooklyn Battery Tunnel  flooded out  storm downgraded  I think that's where  the weathermen  got this wrong  didn't they say  this thing was just  going to hover above  the tri-state area  all day today  originally they made it  seem like yeah  starting from like  midnight last night  it would be heavy rain  and wind for like  a while  like 24 straight hours  because of this storm  they said it's just  going to stop 
[01:41:30]  right over New York  or the tri-state area  for a day  and that's not happening  we did get lucky  compared to what they said  like that could have been  a lot longer  right  and we actually  we could have went  storm trooping again today  stop saying that  is there anywhere  we could go storm trooping  Kenny are you up  for a storm trooping  it's true  it's chasing  it's not even trooping  if you wanted to go  trooping you should have  been with me this morning  it was scary driving in  well why didn't you  shoot video  you people 
[01:42:00]  seeing shit  not getting video  of it  it was driving me nuts  it was pitch black  in New Jersey  not one light was on  right  why don't you get  a hotel room  oh wait  blowing all this water  south  now it's starting  to lap up  over again  oh yeah  we're gonna have  another fucking surge  here  because we got  another high tide  so we should be  down at Battery Park  storm trooping  but is it gonna be  another surge though  or no  yeah 9 o'clock  is high tide  not as bad as yesterday  right  it'd be like 9 feet  instead of 14 feet  or something like that  see I soak in a lot  of knowledge 
[01:42:30]  when I watch the TV  see that's where we were  Jimmy right there  that's true  we were storm trooping  right there  look at my footprints  you missed them  look that's Jimmy's footprints  there's his coffee cup  yeah  the grass couldn't be greener  that's exactly it  but it's always on the other side  right Sammy  yeah see those boards  could have hit us  when we were down there  look she's running  there's another big thing  that could have hit us  I kicked that glass can over  you did  yes you did  I was like  what the fuck  yes you did  garbage cans  sorry  to the poles  with this type of twine  and obviously

[01:50:00]  it's impossible  we were  we were one of the only cars  in Manhattan yesterday  besides like official vehicles  I remain thoroughly unimpressed  just too bad  you missed a good fucking time  maybe I'm just envious  hey  Jimmy said it earlier  in other news  we can do a quick  other news  portion of the show  Letterman and Fallon  perform shows  without an audience  I have a bone to pick  with Mr. Fallon  because he didn't invite you  as the sole audience member  it would have been a good bit  I hope he's in the audience here 
[01:50:30]  all he had to do is go  all he had to do is tweet me  he's tweeted me before  yeah  say hey  Opster I need you  and I would have been  sitting in that audience  an audience of one  I'm not asking for time  on the couch  I would have been  in the audience  right  I have a great natural laugh  I could have went  to Letterman's  I have a very good  natural laugh  it fills a room  if I hear a joke  yeah  you want me to ask for it  or you just want to do it  oh yeah you could  you could ask for it  Jimmy likes when we ask  him to do things  he do  can you give me  your laugh please  why do they do that 
[01:51:00]  just have one audience member  that's the bit  neither show decided to do that  they all went audience free  please tweet Jimmy Fallon  and tell him  I'm very disappointed  I wasn't the audience of one  I could have fucking laughed  and filled that room  with laughter  one more time  it's really obnoxious  just snorted  that's when I'm laughing  for real  when a snort comes out  by the way  if you're wondering  I'm very tired  you can't be tired 
[01:51:30]  when you stop  I can't stormtroomp  and then do radio  the next day  it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy  we have to get past  this tired thing  yeah please  let's go to like  820 today  no  we're all tuckered out  but you gotta hang in there  we're pulling together  to do a show  the Octomom  checks into rehab  oh no  yeah she's all rehabbed out  this confuses me  because I have two kids  and I can't even find time  to have a fucking beer  and she has all that time  yeah I think it's for pills  I'm not positive  to fucking do her drugging  yeah 
[01:52:00]  how is that possible  and she's leaving the 8 kids  with some nannies  and if you go into rehab  and you have 8 kids  they should be taking  the kids away right  of course  isn't that basically  telling the world  you're an irresponsible parent  anybody who has 8 kids  and a pill addiction  should not have the 8 kids  CNN's got some great  fucking pictures  coming in from this storm  because they're actual  stormtroopers  they're really good  the local news  then his worst case scenario  so what roads are closed  now when there are  so many to talk  oh god shut up  yes Jimmy  I twittered a very

[01:54:00]  Sherman Helmsley  how much could it cost  huh  there's a bizarre  legal dispute  continuing  over what  his money  no cause he wants  a two million dollar  burial  he's very pompous  aren't they fighting  over like ten thousand  dollars or something  it's not a lot  isn't it that story  where people go  that's a lot  for some people  not enough  to have the guy  just in a fucking  freezer somewhere  his estate is worth  fifty grand  they're fighting over  fifty grand  I can't believe  he's only worth that 
[01:54:30]  like being one of  the most iconic guys  depressing  but why can't there  be something where  they bury you  and they worry  about the fifty grand  later  why does he have  to stay out  of the ground  cause they're  fighting over  his fifty G's  I don't know  that soul  is not at rest  they see me  does not take  their own  take care  of their own  man  unless he blew  his money  he might have  blown it  but how is he  only worth  fifty grand  that's really sad  I don't know  I mean  the Peter Criss book  he was worth  like a hundred  thousand  but Peter blew  through millions 
[01:55:00]  being stupid  and doing drugs  I mean  I don't think  Sherman did that  alright I gotta  get back  to reading that  book  I've been  distracted  the last couple  days  it's hard to read  during the storm  days  well  you know  there's a lot  of storm  tromping  tromping to be  done  where are we  tromping today  Kenny  you wanna try  to go downtown  a little bit  or you just  wanna go home  I'm just hoping  I can get home  why  to no power  why don't you  just stay in a  nice hotel  maybe I'll do  what I wanna do  it's a good 
[01:55:30]  idea  it would make  you more  comfortable  that's true  and make your  job a lot  easier  you want us  to get you  a hotel  you want a  hotel  Kenny  I'll talk  to you  Sirius did  offer me  a hotel  yesterday  and what  happened  I said  I said  I'll  you know  consider it  why didn't  you take it  because I  have a family  to take care  of  bring them  with you  well I might  have to find  a pet friendly  hotel today  oh you guys  might move  to a local  hotel today  well I can't  be without  power for a  week  what am I 
[01:56:00]  gonna do  read  yeah you  could do  a little  reading  oh  fucking  last night  I just  tried to  go to bed  because there  was nothing  else to do  then 10 o'clock  people start  texting me  turn off  your phone  even in a  natural disaster  I turned  off my phone  last night  no because  my regular  phone wasn't  working so  you gotta  keep the  cell phone  no I  don't care  whatever  happens in  the middle  of the night  you can  wait for  the morning  no  what can I  possibly do  if you wake  me up at  three in the  morning  people I 
[01:56:30]  care about  are right  next to me  and in the  building next  door  and the  building next  door  I just  turned my  shit off  even last  night I  turned my  phones off  what could I  do for these  people  and then I  turn it on  and it's like  it's kind of like  Christmas you see  what happened  overnight it's  kind of nice  it's fun  it's not Christmas  it's a natural  disaster  it's fun because  it's like a nice  surprise you're  like oh fuck  this guy was in a  horrific car accident  this guy has a  tree on his  fucking house  it's the worst  Christmas ever  why  it's terrible 
[01:57:00]  news  turning on your  phone in the  morning after it's  being off all  night is one of  the fucking guilty  pleasures of  living  plus what if you  find out like  Eric like oh I  have to go rescue  some people I'm  going to be out for  the rest of the  week  where is Eric  is he in mid  rescue right now  in a rowboat  why can't we get  the phones on at  all  call him on your  phone  all right I got a  text from Gary that  said we should be  able to make  alcohol and calls  that's not true  no no I'm not  even close I got  nothing we can't  power up the thing  all right I'm gonna  call Eric then  Gary's stupid I mean 
[01:57:30]  he's not here to  and that's not a  bitch by the way I'm  still bitch free for  20 some odd days I'm  just stating a fact  there he's just  stupid you know  what don't say you're  tuckered out when  everyone is feeling  yes sad that a  storm has passed  yeah you should at  that same time be  feeling glad that the  storm has passed  nice  what  it's Jimspirations  a Z-Rock  this is yeah you 
[01:58:00]  talked to him he's  gonna be mad  up there's a scream  that's what we hear  there's a you're  fired  you're putting up  with our shit today  I'll tell you right  now he's right now  eating a fucking  your call has been  forwarded to an  automated voice  messaging system  he's probably  drinking a meat  daiquiri  a roast beef  daiquiri  no he said he's  gotta go rescue  his family  yeah I gotta get  the story on that  I mean it could be  I'm sure it's you  know I don't want  anything bad to have 
[01:58:30]  to do his family or  whatever but I gotta  get the whole story  behind that  his family lives in  Florida  yeah maybe he's  jumping in his  power boat and  that's why he's  riding through the  storm on the waves  I think they're in  that trouble area  Long Alec for real  supposedly they were  stuck on their  second floor  how would he  but a second floor  is cool  and what's he gonna  do  I don't know  and how does he  know it's gonna  take a whole week  he's taking the  rest of the week  off he told me  he's only gonna  take up too much  room in the boat  and he stopped you  in mid-conversation  with Blatter  oh my god  why  he stopped me 
[01:59:00]  in mid-conversation  with Blatter  me Jimmy and  Blatter were kind  of shooting the  shit kind of  getting the lay  of the land  what's going on  blah blah blah  and then he  like hey I  need to talk  to you right  away  and I go  hold on a minute  he goes  I just want  to let you  know that I'm  gonna try to be  here tomorrow  but if I'm  not is that  okay  yeah  that's what he  stopped your  conversation for  exactly a needy  moment  yes  because he  wanted  he dramatically  stopped  the conversation  he wanted you  to be like  you know  you're really 
[01:59:30]  a necessary  part of the  team  I know we  bust your  balls on the  air  but when it  comes right  down to it  nobody Eric  is more  important than  you  I go Eric  you gotta do  what you gotta  do  of course  whatever  I'm in the  middle of a  conversation over  here  exactly  Blatter was  just about to  explain his  awful choice  of jackets  you don't like  his storm  jackets  they're terrible  everyone was  wearing their  storm gear  yesterday  they all look  like adventurer  jackets  yeah  you still hear  the mics popping  by the way  yeah of course  what is that  we're probably  gonna have to  go home early

[02:14:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show  We got me and Jim Norton today  Sam Roberts helping out  You're welcome to the audience  How about you're welcome to the audience?  Well, maybe they are saying thank you  We don't know  They should be  We're cut off from our audience  No phones  I hate doing radio without phones  It's alright  Yeah, I don't mind  I mean, we would help today to hear that people are supposed to go on 
[02:14:30]  Today, everyone has a story  I want to hear the stories  We don't even understand why the phones don't work  I don't know either  How can we figure out how to broadcast but not figure out the phone part?  I don't know  You would think that my phone works  Yeah  How hard could it be?  We're transmitting a radio show via satellite  But we can't figure out the phone part  It has to go to the satellite  And then bounce back down  But we can't get the phones working  I'll never understand this shit  That's the easy part  Seems like the easy stuff is the problem always 
[02:15:00]  The morning mashups producer was getting a little worried  That there weren't going to be any phones  And I was like  What do they do?  You still got the hits  We get a call  What do you give a fuck?  They play 20 songs an hour  They talk for 30 seconds  There's five guys that have to talk among themselves for 30 seconds  And they're having a problem today  Well because I think today was tell me something good  So  What?  Oh, oh  Their benchmark bit  Their benchmark bit, yeah  Really?  And Stan took the week off  We do a talk show  And, you know  Phones help you through a talk show 
[02:15:30]  And we don't have phones  We do a talk show  And half our guys are gone  Right  And Jim's tired  Because he had a visitor  No, he's tuckered out  He's tuckered out  Because he had a visitor last night  And doesn't know how to prioritize  Didn't even reach out to his parents  Well I talked to my  I just texted my sister  And everyone's alright?  Yeah  Where did they sleep last night?  In the ocean?  No, they were okay  He said no power  No power?  Alright  Yeah, they're in one of those Jersey towns  That got fucking  Fucked up  I had to come though  He's got so much trouble prioritizing Jim does 
[02:16:00]  He kind of does, yes  Yes, I do  But he is here  He is here  Work is always a priority for me  And my job  And career is always a priority  Hand in hand  With coming  With having this  This problem area  Beneath my belly button  Taken care of  Just a slight problem area  It's a terrible addiction  You were able to do some storm trooping  I did storm trooping  I think Jess is annoyed at you  By the way  Why?  Because you called her homebody  And said she wasn't invited to storm trooping  Ooh  I don't invite broads to storm trooping 
[02:16:30]  See, that's the type of thing  That will annoy a broad  Well, I don't know what to tell you  Sometimes I want to like  Do fucking guy things  What if she's an explorer  And you pigeonhole her  Into being a homebody  We can negotiate  Certainly  I mean, I'm not close-minded  To the idea  But in general  I'm like, hey  I told my wife  I'm going out there  I go, you know me  I gotta check this shit out  You know me  I got adventure in my heart, honey  You know what I gotta do  I gotta be out there  And then she said  Alright, just be careful  Yeah, but she has children 
[02:17:00]  Yeah  You're children to watch  Which makes me more careful these days  When I was in the Outer Banks  When that hurricane hit  I was two years in a row  Hurricanes hit in the Outer Banks  Thus then  Why I didn't go there this summer, by the way  And of course, no hurricane  Of course  The year I don't go  It's no hurricane  And then you stay here  And there's a hurricane  Of course  Everywhere you go  There's a hurricane  Of course  You're the hurricane whisperer  And I wanted to stay  My brother is really adventurous  And we wanted to stay  Right out the storm  Because I saw the locals were staying 
[02:17:30]  Your father  You gotta know how to read people  If you're in a hurricane area  And the locals are staying  They've been through this shit  A million times  They know what the fuck's up  And I knew I'd be alright  But we  No, of course  We had to fucking leave  You gotta protect the young ones  But then you're  But then I would have  Had a lot of guilt  If I like  You know  Made everyone leave  With my kid  And stayed behind  To have a fucking  Rock and roll good time  Yeah  Yeah, but then you're saying  Like Jess doesn't like  To have a good time  She would rather  Just sit in a hotel room  By herself 
[02:18:00]  And watch a movie  Yeah, yeah  She was annoying  Well, I don't care  I'm not married to her  Well, you should still  I don't have to impress her  You don't have to impress  But you do have to  You know  Consider the way  Other people  You know  Take the things  That you say  Right  My storm  Trooping vehicle  Wasn't adequate enough  For many people  Yeah  There wasn't a bunch  Of like dolls  And things that girls  Like in the storm  Trooping vehicle  That's right  No, just baby seats  That's right  Yeah, girls do like that  Hey man  Yeah  The storm wasn't  Gonna wait for me  To take my baby seats out  So I fucking went with it 
[02:18:30]  That's right  And you had to get  Your storm trooping done  Before the storm  Actually started  And got dangerous  Jimmy  We were out there  I was just looking  At that tree  I said that fucking tree  I could fall right on us  And it almost did  Fucking kicked it  And I walked away  Look what happened  If we hung out  A few more hours  That tree could have  Came down on us  Sam Roberts  Yeah, a few more  But why would you  Spend hours at Battery Park  We were bored  We had to move on  To other things  We had to see  What else was going on  We just missed  That whole facade  Coming down  That's the road  I took back uptown  It seemed like  That's the just missed tour  That was in 
[02:19:00]  Where was that  The meatpacking district  Or something like that  14th  Chelsea  Chelsea  What  14th street  Wow  Colin's got to be  Colin just moved  Down to that area  That dummy  Oh to what  Zone A  He was on 56th street  He moved right  To Hurricane Central  Fucking idiot  That's perfect for him  Perfect  I was fine before  But  See what women do  Now she's mad at me  Because I speak the truth  She was  You didn't speak the truth 
[02:19:30]  Learn Sam  Learn  You said in a degrading way  Just because you get married  Doesn't mean you can't  Go off and be a guy  Too still  There's so many couples  That make that mistake  They're like fuck  I'm not allowed to do  Anything anymore  I just got married  I wasn't not allowed  To go stormtrooping  I just didn't want to  Drive around in the rain  Before the storm happened  You wanted me to take your wife  Around  No I wanted you to extend  The invitation to both of us  Hell no  And why is that  Because I was  I called up Roland  And then Jimmy text me  It was perfect  I needed an extra seat 
[02:20:00]  In my stormtrooping vehicle  In case Jimmy wrote me  Bunch of men  Stormtrooping  And look it worked out  Yeah  You know how embarrassing  It would have been  If I go Jimmy  I can't pick you up  I got a broad in the car  I'm stormtrooping  With a broad  This whole adventure  Sounds homoerotic now  Why  Why  There's a bunch of guys  Running around  Before the storm really hits  That's true  Taking photos  Embracing each other  That's the angle  That's the angle  That's the angle  Gay guys take by the way  Well  Other guys are just  Very secure  And like just hanging out 
[02:20:30]  With men for a little bit  Just a little  Some high waters  And some high winds  Just hold each other  We didn't hold each  Well we did hold each other  A little bit  A little bit  Give me that  For the picture we did  Jimmy was feeling a little bit  We were very happy  That's what I thought  We were very happy  We were experiencing  A big event together  That's what I thought  I felt it  A very big battery  I felt it  Yes it was very nice  I'm just glad  With all the storms  Jim didn't drop his coffee cup  No I would always hold  My coffee cup  It's my lucky cup  You were holding it tight  Yes I was  I always have a napkin with me 
[02:21:00]  Roland's just out there  In a fucking t-shirt  That guy's nuts  He showed up here on Sunday  Like I said  With all that meat  And all the salad fixings  And everything  And I said  Where's your rain jacket  Yeah  Oh I forget the rain jacket  Roland why don't you sit  At the big table  At the big boys  Take a seat Roland  Where you at with broads  Doing like guy things  No I mean  You should be able  To do your own thing  Yeah why not  What's wrong with that  It's a men adventure  Yeah  First of all  What's a men adventure  And second of all 
[02:21:30]  She couldn't do her own thing  Because she was trapped  In a hotel room  Because you wouldn't  Fucking splurge  For a hotel movie  She didn't want to  Sit in a hotel room  Watching a movie  That's not a fun thing  That's not a fun thing  What's a fun thing  For someone to do  But that's what you guys  Did anyway  You didn't walk around  Is that what you did  Yes I did  Jimmy got the hurricane special  You got a good blowing  She wanted to hang out  So where did you hang out  Because I didn't  You know  Come up with the big event 
[02:22:00]  For you guys  To do  Well first of all  I wasn't asking  For you to come up  With the big event  I didn't even respond  To your stormtrooping  Yeah because  He was very upset though  Because you know  I would have called you out  You think Sam wasn't  Allowed to respond to it  I think he was  A little scared  I wasn't scared at all  I think he wanted  To be safe in his hotel room  I wasn't scared  All warm and comfy  I wasn't scared at all  So what did you guys do  We walked around  Times Square a bit  We had a nice lunch  Hung out in a hotel room  What did you have for lunch  But you did 
[02:22:30]  You did all this stuff  You could have done  On a nice fall day  I mean  When the storm's coming in  You go  Alright what can I do  Storm related  You could go to  Battery Park  On a fall day too  And see what we saw yesterday  Well you can't go to  Times Square  In rush hour  And be alone  In the middle  We saw a jet skiing  Lunatic  We saw the news  Over exaggerating  Yeah but we went  To Times Square  And got to take photos  Of ourselves  Alone in Times Square  In rush hour  Exactly 
[02:23:00]  That's what  Crickets  Nobody was around  It's fucking nuts  What kind of lunch did you have  That is fucking sick  Right  It's not sick  Isn't it sick  Fuck yeah  Yeah  We didn't care  And we didn't even care  That there weren't people around  It was devilish  I wouldn't give a fuck  Just me and Satan  I don't know what to tell you  If your broad's mad  No she's not mad  She's just like  Is she alright  Is she gonna be alright  She's mad  Is she gonna squirt  Squirt  Cry  Oh I thought 
[02:23:30]  That was like orgasm  Well it could be  Well she gets off  On this stuff too  She's alright  She's fine  But  She's had it huh  She needs to get back  To Westchester  Well that's the thing  Her annoyance  She's at a heightened  Level of annoyance  Are you guys leaving today  No how can we leave  There's no place to go  They're gonna  They're gonna open up  Some shit  Are they  Yes the storm's done  I don't know  Everything's closed right now  The way you're going  They'll open up some shit  Hopefully  You go over one of  The littler bridges right  Yeah we can get over  The Henry Hudson  We can go over  Alright that'll be open today 
[02:24:00]  I guarantee it  We've booked another room  Just in case  So you guys go home  All nice  Hopefully  And come back here tomorrow  Well unless the power's out  Yeah  Then it won't be nice  Scott would like me to say  Tell Brillo Headed Sam  This isn't faggot radio  Fucking cuckold  What is cuckold?  That doesn't even make sense  In this  You had a responsibility  To the guys yesterday  To do some storm  Trooping  First of all  No I did not have  Any responsibility  To you  And you let us all down  I had no responsibility  To you  Yeah  Because Opie parked 
[02:24:30]  His truck under this crane  And said wait right here  While you take pictures  What?  Let's see what happens  I just heard something  In crane  Yeah  When you parked under the crane  To take a picture  Of the other crane  Yesterday  Yeah  See it was dangerous  Yeah I don't know  What Roland said  That has to do  With this scenario  No we were like  Making sure the other  Cranes were secure  So we went on a crane tour  Yeah that doesn't  Sound like fun  No that's fun  I'm not sad  That I missed  The crane tour  Why?  Why would I want to  Go on a crane tour?  I know the crane 
[02:25:00]  Could have been dangling  It wasn't though  Yeah but we had to  Make sure  Yeah we checked  That was the adventure  How'd it go?  It was good  Yeah  Sometimes it's about  The journey  Oh the destination  Not the journey  Sometimes the journey  Is the destination  What?  Is the phrase  Sometimes the journey  Is the destination  Yeah exactly that  That's what we were doing yesterday  I don't think I would have fun  On the journey  The journey was awesome  What was better Jim  Your afternoon or your evening?  Jimmy  I would say  That my afternoon  Was more adventurous  Thank you  But my early evening 
[02:25:30]  Was a home run  How much time did it take  From me dropping you off  From stormtrooping  To going on  To your next adventure?  Let's see  What time did I send that text?  Oh my god  I bet you it was minutes  No  I bet you didn't even  Make it to your elevator  Before you put the word out  Hold on  Alright  And the other question is  How come Sal  Didn't get the big invite? 
[02:26:00]  He's staying at Roland's Hotel  Him and Roland  Were stormtrooping  I don't know Sal  And you don't want to  Get to know him  I don't know  We'll see  He made it in today  So that's a good sign  What time did you drop me off?  When it got dark  Because that was  The only thing  I wanted to get home  Before dark  Just because I wouldn't  Be able to see shit  So whenever dark was  5.30ish  So 6.11 I sent  Barely a half hour  A little over a half hour 
[02:26:30]  Not quite 30 minutes  41 minutes  Nice  You wouldn't want to  Invite Sal on stormtrooping  Why don't you invite Sal  On today's stormtrooping  I feel bad I didn't invite Jimmy  But I didn't think  It was his thing  I told him  This is my thing  Celebrity photos  Is your thing  This is my thing  I was sleeping anyway  I wouldn't have gotten the text  I like checking out  This weird shit  Yeah  And Roland I knew  Was all in  Because I saw his Instagram  From earlier in the day  Where he was just  Wandering around in a t-shirt  Taking pictures of the city  So I figured  Okay he's up for a ride 
[02:27:00]  I dragged Sal with me  Oppie sent me  I saw Oppie's Twitter  I think it's Kopey  I saw that  Cool crane photo  So I was like  Oh wow is he out  Did he take that  Fuck yeah  I was on the scene man  That's what you do  Yeah I didn't have any desire  I think I said him and Roland  Were rolling around man  And Roland kept Jimmy's seat  Nice and warm for him  Oh it sucks  Sitting in a seat  It's all hot  I got in there  It was all warm  On my adventure  You know it's just warm  From someone else's ass 
[02:27:30]  That's a horrible feeling  Sweatpants  The worst  The worst is when that happens  In a bathroom  Like a public bathroom  When you sit down  On toilet like here  Oh yeah the side of your face  You feel it  What?  Alright what else  Are we gonna do  Should we go home?  When you press your  Naked ass cheeks  On a toilet  That's warm  Right  That's terrible  Not if it's winter  What?  What if it's not  Your butt cheeks  What if it's your  Your chicks  Oh that's fine then  Let's see you taking  Back to back dumps  Dude I laugh at toilets  You guys are rookies 
[02:28:00]  I shit in the parking lot  Of MetLife Stadium  Before the Jets game  Yeah  Was it gross?  Well it's new though  With people  Banging on the  It was a port-a-potty  I should have mentioned  You didn't mind  Oh jeez  I shit in the parking lot  With people waiting  To use the port-a-potty  I could never do that  We were in section  At that point  We were still in section E  And there were like  Literally two port-a-potties  You had to make that  For that whole area  And there was a whole line  And they started  Pounding on the door  And I just sat there  And took my time  Although it's weird 
[02:28:30]  To let like  A dump go  Without hearing the water  Or anything  Just knowing it's just  Falling into mud  I feel bad for it  It's falling into mud  Like it was all safe  And warm in my body  And I gave birth to it  And sent it on its way  It's just mud though  Something just isn't  Right about that  What do you got  CNN what are they saying  Death floods  And destruction  Sandy causes  At least 16 US deaths  More than 7 million  Without electricity  168 stranded  Throughout New York City 
[02:29:00]  168  Mmhmm  That's not a lot  Well I mean  It's a  You do realize  What happened in New Orleans  A few years back  Right  Yeah  They were not prepared  For that  I'm getting pictures  Sent to me  From Atlantic City  Pretty crazy  And some of the  Traffic lights are down  It was some rough wind  Yeah Atlantic City  Is fucked for the locals  Not if you're a casino owner  Though you're fine man  Alright this is where  We would go to the phones 
[02:29:30]  Let's be honest with each other  What's going on with the phone  You're going to call  Iraq again on speaker  Yeah let's try the Iraq thing  Iraq sent me a text  That he's not going to be  In for the rest of the week  Because he has to go  Save his family  What's he doing  How sad is it  If you're waiting for Iraq  They're stuck on the  Second floor of a house  So he decided  That that's got to be  At least a week off  Anthony's stuck on Long Island  He took the whole crew  With him  And then got stuck out there  Yeah  I want to see Anthony's  Helicopter footage  I bet you that would be good  Oh you launched 
[02:30:00]  The helicopter out  I don't know  You know he's going to  Put a helicopter in the sky  That would be perfect  Yeah  I don't like that Iraq's  Not picking up his phone  Just text him first  See that we got to talk to you  Well I mean  If he's rescuing  Wouldn't he have his phone ready  He's not rescuing  He's sleeping  He's sleeping  In the middle of  Is he sleeping in  He's definitely sleeping in  You think he's taking  A few extra hours  For his big rescue mission  Of course he is  In the middle of like  In the middle of like  In the middle of robot  Robot  Robot  Wow I got to sleep too 
[02:30:30]  Row  Boat  Runs  He should have time  For a phone call  From us right  I know  I'm tired too though  There's something about  Whenever my windows rattle  I just  My brain sends out melatonin  It keeps you awake  It makes me tired  Tuckered out  A bit tuckered out  Yes  So that would have been  20 minutes right there  If we got Iraq on the phone  It's one  Yeah  Especially like  Him saying  Listen  I'm going to try to be there tomorrow 
[02:31:00]  But if I can't make it in  Is that okay  And you're like  I don't care  Like he went from being like  I'm really going to try my damnedest  To be there  And I know that you need me  To  Well if I'm not there  I might as well sleep in  You sent the message out yesterday  I read it earlier in the show  So listen to the replay  Iraq needs the rest of the week off  To go rescue his family  Stuck on the  He's out of his mind  Why  His family is probably  One of those houses  That flooded badly  Oh it's Eric  Oh shit  Okay  You talk to him  I don't want to deal with this shit 
[02:31:30]  Okay  I'm permanent speaking  Eric  Yeah  You're on the air  But we don't have phones  So you're on my speaker phone  Hi Iraq  Hi Iraq  Oh hey guys  How you doing today buddy?  Can you hear  We've been better  Where are you?  I'm at my house right now  What  You're not coming in  For the rest of the week?  I can't hear him  He said  He wants to know  If you're coming 
[02:32:00]  Well hold on  Let's start with this  What happened at your house  Because I read a couple  Of your text messages earlier  It was crazy  It sounded like  Yeah what happened  At his house?  What happened at your house?  You're right  They're saying  What happened at my house?  Yes  About 5 o'clock  Lightning hit the tree  Right to the  On the side of my house here  And split the tree  And knocked it down  The transformer  Wires were everywhere  And we lost power  About 5 o'clock  Did he write  But so far 
[02:32:30]  That seems to be  The only damage  That I have  Does he have power?  So you don't have power  As of what  5 p.m.  You lost power  In your house  And you don't have it back?  About 5 p.m.  About 5 p.m.  Yesterday  Yeah  And you don't have power now?  Yeah  I have no power  But  How's the rest  Of the neighborhood?  What is he yelling?  I can't hear him  Sorry he's exasperated  How's the rest  Of the neighborhood?  There's trees everywhere  And there's wires  All on the street  So I'm pretty much  You know  Just sitting here 
[02:33:00]  At my house right now  Yeah  So is he coming in  Tomorrow?  Yeah we'll see you  Tomorrow then?  Maybe  I don't know yet  I have to go  I'm gonna try tonight  To go meet up  With my brother  My brother's house  Got  Totaled from the storm  Flooded up to the second floor  Wow  Where does he live?  And  Where does he live?  He lived in  In the Rockaway area  At Bell Harbor  Oh  Yeah that area  Got fucked 
[02:33:30]  Yeah  And  So they  They actually had  They got rescued by boat  About 5 o'clock this morning  From the  From the second floor  Of their house  And brought over  To Brooklyn  And my older sister  Was not too far from there  In Breezy Point  Where  It was all flooded  And there's like  Over 50 houses  On fire right now  So  We're not 100% sure  If she lost her house  Did they ask him  If they were able to bring  Like were they bringing stuff  From the fucking  Bottom floor  Up to the top floor 
[02:34:00]  Like were they able  To save shit?  Yeah  I could barely hear part of that  Were they able to save things  Like could they bring their stuff  Up from the top floor  I mean the bottom floor  And put it on the second floor  Before the flooding got bad?  They got some stuff upstairs  They got some stuff upstairs  Like important papers  Their computer  And what not  They were in the living room  And the  Where they are  It's a peninsula  Right there  It's like a barrier beach  To Long Island  Brooklyn, Queens 
[02:34:30]  And the ocean  And the ocean just came  Riding up the street  And met with  Jamaica Bay  And they were in the living room  And right as  The ocean came up  It just started coming in  Through the front door  And  Through the sides of the house  Completely flooding the basement  And then started rising up  In the first floor  So they  They managed to  Grab a bunch of stuff  And  They were  On the second story  Of their house  For  I think  Since like  Eight, nine o'clock 
[02:35:00]  They don't have power right?  They don't have power then?  No  They don't have anything  And there was fires near them too  Wow  That sucks  Yeah  From 114th street  I think one of the fires  Started spreading up  To 117  119  And then  Hitting that area  To  It was just jumping  From house to house  Because all the houses  Were under water  And most of the  People were stuck  On the second floors  Of their house  It was even so bad  Like the second precinct  Police department 
[02:35:30]  The cops were on  The second floor  Because the first floor  Was flooded  And  A lot of the area  The fire was just jumping  From rooftop to rooftop  From  In the Rockaway area  At the breezy point  So where are they now?  Where do they take them  After they  Took your brother  From his  Flooded house  And your sister  From her house?  My sister never  Made it back  To her house  She was somewhere else  And  She's  At a friend's house  Right now  That has power  In Queens  But  Yeah 
[02:36:00]  My brother  And his family  Were at their house  Until about  Five o'clock  This morning  When they got rescued  Ask him if he has  Family in Toronto  Do you have any family  In Toronto, Canada?  Are you fucking  Plugging during this?  I hate you so much  Looks like we gotta go over there  And do some stormtrooping 
[02:36:30]  Are you jealous  Are you jealous  That you didn't get invited  To go stormtrooping?  Storm what?  Stormtrooping  Also known as  Stormtrooping  Stormtrooping  Oh nevermind  So what do you  So where does your brother go?  Do you have to go to a shelter?  Is he in your place?  No he's  He's at  My  My sister-in-law's 
[02:37:00]  Cousin's house  Right now  And  Then they're coming  To  Stay with  Stay with us  Ask him  I'm not happy  You're gonna go over there  He has a legitimate reason  To be missing work  So  How happy  After everything that's happened  How happy are you  That you have a legitimate reason  To be missing work?  I'm not happy at all  Jesus Sam  You're a piece of shit  And I know  Somebody told you to say that  No  No  I wouldn't  No 
[02:37:30]  Nobody told me to say that  That's ridiculous  Um  Yeah  No  I guess  In hindsight  That was an inappropriate question  Uh  No  So why  So how come you can't  Ask him if he was able to get to the supermarket  To get  Everything he needed for his  The real question  For his  Like we understand  For his Coke floats  There's a lot that's going on  And  And  And you've got a lot going on  With family and everything  Yeah I'm up  I'll call him back  Yeah call him back  I'll call him back  I need to know if he's able to get a Coke float in or two  Ask him 
[02:38:00]  If he bought umbrellas  Yeah because that's a big deal  Why was he annoyed by that question  I don't know  He called me a piece of shit  He's got to be extremely happy  That he's got a legitimate reason  To miss work  Just tell him  Your call has been  He doesn't want to deal with our nonsense  Try him in another minute or two  Okay  Just  And go  What happened  I guess  I guess the phone's got 
[02:38:30]  Should I just say  Sorry buddy  Disconnected  Yeah yeah yeah  You know  Because maybe it was on my end  And I don't even realize it  But  Yeah we got to know  Look man  We all know someone  That got into a situation  Because of this storm  Of course  Yeah my brother's got a massive  Fucking tree on his house  In northern New Jersey  And when the power goes out  I was heard from him by the way  We're a little worried  When the power goes out  It's impossible to keep ice cream  And without ice cream  How do you do a Coke float  How is he going to be able to consume  That's exactly right  That's the concern 
[02:39:00]  Without the essentials  Needed  For said consuming  Let me see  What  This is not good sounds  You heard that right Sal  Yeah I have no idea  What's going on today  Yeah I know  You said yeah I know  Yeah  People don't know if I'm saying  Home buddy  Or home body  I don't know  You figure it out  She's my home buddy  You just figure it out  On your own  Let's see  Don't worry about it  Let's see if we can get through this  Some of this phone trouble 
[02:39:30]  Okay  Why wouldn't he fucking talk to us man  He's like out there  I know  What's he doing  Goofing off  He's out there among the people  Some shit is going down  He lost a fucking tree  He's got family  Stuck in the  On the second floor of their homes  He's being rescued by a rowboat  That's some shit you don't hear every day  Hello  Fuck you  What  No no no no no  That's not  We wanted to know 
[02:40:00]  So everything's okay  With your brother right  I have the radio on  In the car  I heard what you said  No that's not what you said  Hope wanted to make sure  We call you back  To make sure  Yeah we wanted to make sure  You're alright  Everything's going  Like your family is safe  Correct  Ask him which  I am not falling for this shit  They are safe though  Ask him if he's figured out  Which blimpies are open  They're fine  Okay  And  Have you figured out  Which blimpies are open  He hung up again 
[02:40:30]  Why else would he be in the car  He's probably driving around  Probably got the good news  That there's a blimpies open  Yeah  He's on a boat right now  Fucking oaring  He has every right to hang up  So why  He just told us  His sister's house  Was on fire  And we asked him  If he's figured out 
[02:41:00]  Which blimpies are open  And how happy he is  That he has a legitimate reason  For missing work  And the legitimate reason is  That his brother's house  Was flooded  And his sister's house  Is on fire  That's a terrible conversation  To have with someone  Wait a minute  There's such a lack  Of caring involved  We don't know  If his sister's house  Is on fire  Probably  And did I not  Acknowledge earlier  That I feel guilty  That I didn't go through 
[02:41:30]  More shit with this storm  Yeah  I got a little seasick  Because my building  Was swaying  I still want to know  How many feet  The damn building  Swayed from about  500 feet up  Call him  I got a good joke  To play  He'll talk to fucking Chip  Call him  I got a fucking hilarious  Sam I know  He'll talk to Chip  Should I call him  On my phone again  Yeah  Okay  Yeah yeah  Okay  We'll just say  And this time it's for real  Because Chip wants to  Yeah yeah yeah  He's listening to us right now  You're gonna  You're gonna get a phone call  From Chip  Not us  Not us  It's Chip  I got a good one  Phone's ringing 
[02:42:00]  Alright  This is gonna be  A fucking home run  Answer the phone  It's Chip  Answer the phone  Piece of garbage  He doesn't even get  What I just said  What was the first  Hold on  What was the first part  Of my statement  That I felt guilty  That I didn't  Come up again  But he's so  Can I point out  How dumb this kid is 
[02:42:30]  For real  My whole statement  Started with  I feel guilty  I didn't go through  More shit  The only thing that  Happened was  I got a little seasick  I was making fun of myself  So you can't then  Make fun of me  You idiot  He doesn't care  I gotta go  Call him back  Alright I'm gonna call him  Eric if you're listening  Chip wants to talk to you  Not any of us  Don't tell him that  Cause I gotta  I'm gonna fucking kill him  Okay it's not Chip  Is that a chip?  Well it's not Chip  He's doing some  Valley chip  Oh my god  He's so fucking 
[02:43:00]  Gritty or something  What's he doing  Fucking floating or something  Connection trouble  This time  And if he stays on the line  Ask him where he's driving to  Time to take a bath  In the river or something  Hello Chip  Hey  Ask he  Ask he rock  If he's got  Is his refrigerator running?  Say is your refrigerator running?  Eric is your refrigerator running?  You better fucking catch it  You fucking pig 
[02:43:30]  Oh  Eric don't listen to Chip  The question was  Where are you driving to?  I don't think he trusts our line of questioning anymore  What was the worst one Sam?  I need to know  I mean I think the worst one  The blimpies  Was the blimpies one  Yeah  Cause he heard us trying to ask the coke float question  We didn't really get that question out there  But I think blimpies  The work  Was probably the worst  I know it started to take a turn 
[02:44:00]  When Jim snuck a plug in  He really thought we were listening to him  For the first time  Yeah that's when he realized  Things were taking a turn  And this was not going to turn out  The way he had hoped  Right  Yeah  Where do you think he's driving to?  You can't drive to where his brother is  Probably somewhere on Grady  I don't know  He's probably  I mean  If I know Eric  Like I think I know Eric  He's probably feeling a little down  About losing power and stuff  So he's probably looking for a Cracker Barrel 
[02:44:30]  To kind of cheer himself up  You think it's all  He's just looking at his video games  All silent  Yeah  He wants to play DWE 13  So bad  And he can't  Cause he's got no power  How is he going to get fan fiction done?  He'll do it by candlelight  He'll just write it  Yeah yeah yeah  Cause he missed Raw  Cause of no power  He missed Monday Night Raw  So he'll write his own show  He likes that a little better  The fans do that fan fiction  There are  It's not as bad for wrestling  As it is for like other things  Like there's  Twilight and Star Trek fan fiction  Douchebags 
[02:45:00]  It's huge  I saw by the way  Part of that  Snow White and the Huntsman  I hear it  Some people love it  And some people say it's soft  What I saw of it  It was really good  And I love Kristen Stewart man  She's fucking beautiful  Yeah  I kind of have a crush on her  You do  She's a good actress too  Yeah she's a very  She's 22 or whatever  She's a really good actress  She's not a bad actress  We would have allowed her  To stormtroop with us  I'd kiss her  Why would you say that  And not Jess?  Because Jimmy likes her  I love her  You don't like Jess?  I like Jess  I like Jess  But I love Kristen Stewart  So it's about what Jimmy likes 
[02:45:30]  And if that's what Jimmy needed  To do some stormtrooping  With the Opster  Then so be it  Oh  I want to kiss Kristen Stewart  So don't worry  I couldn't stop watching that movie  And thinking of like  Was she getting fucked in  Between this scene and that scene?  Really?  Was she sucking that director's cock  Right before she made this?  I bet she was  I was saying those things  Really loud in my room  While jerking off  Some people just watch the movie  That's weird  You go deep  Robert Pattinson can't watch that movie  Because all he's thinking  Is she was cheating on me  While she shot this  Why would you jerk off  If you had a visitor coming? 
[02:46:00]  No no  This was when I was in Philly  Oh  Oh okay  I did like it though  What's his name  Who he had in  Was very good  Hemsworth  Liam Hemsworth  Someone on CNBC  Chris Hemsworth  I think  I'm sorry Chris  Liam's his brother  Yeah he was cool  Bitchclown writes  Don't know if you were just watching  Can we get clips from the back still?  He said on CNBC  Oh this might be a while now  Is my Twitter not really updating them?  No whatever  He said  They cut a reporter 
[02:46:30]  They cut to a reporter live  He didn't realize they were live  And said fuck  Not fuck  He said forget CNBC  He was all pissed off  Really?  Yeah  If we could find that club  We'd be good  When we first went to  Bradley Park  We saw the camera guy  Yelling at the reporter  Remember?  Yeah I do  That's all  Obi  You're not thinking of the listeners  In that exchange just now?  Why?  What happened?  Nobody understood what Roland just said  Trust me  I speak Roland though  I know but you gotta  It's not up to me to explain that to the listeners  They gotta fucking learn 
[02:47:00]  You have to bring the listeners in  Say again Roland  When we went to  First Battery Park  The camera guy was screaming at his reporter  See?  That's still not clear for the listeners  When we first went to Battery Park  When we went to First Battery Park  Right  Cameraman was screaming at a reporter  Okay  His guy  Mmhmm  We're gonna take a break here  What do we got to play Sal?  You've had 45 minutes to figure out something  We literally just got to let back  He's been busy sitting there  Oh he got to let?  Yeah but yeah Profit  Patrice O'Neal  Track 2 of Elephant in the Room I believe 
[02:47:30]  Wait Sam  You think Sal was sloughing it off in there?  Yeah he's not really  What's Track 2?  What's Track 2?  I don't even know  I have to look it up  Give me a second  Oh boy  Where did you ask for this?  Why didn't you have that already?  He's not even  I don't know if the listeners noticed that  Sal decided to start playing like promos and stuff over  I wait till the song ended  And then I  Jimmy  Jimmy  We were listening to the promo and the song together  It was nice  Same time?  It almost worked 
[02:48:00]  We thought you were trying to do some  Sam left the room  I didn't know when the song was gonna end  So I thought there was a lull in the track  You just wait till he stops singing  But wouldn't you like make sure that it was over  And not some kind of lull in the track  Cause it was a lull in the track  And then they came back with  I'm gonna gangnam stop  I could not verify that  Sam turned the screen away  That's part of the beauty of the song  There's a silence  There's a moment there  We have to wait for him to come back in with that shit  He's blaming Sam too  Yeah  Sam  Throwing Sam under the bus  Yep  It's not working though  Is it?  What about Elephant in the Room track 2? 
[02:48:30]  I'm pulling it up right now  Alright  What does track 2 say?  Taking a while  Should've been doing this yesterday  When he was sitting at home  Or when we wanted to play it last break  Yeah  That would mean that  There's a good possibility  We'd play at this break  Consider we don't have much to really play  Into breaks right now  So you're saying that he's not  He's not looking at the big picture  He's just in there having a ball  He's not a forward thinking guy  So I'll do a comment about Sam's remarks 
[02:49:00]  He's just trying to start shit with me today  And I'm just  Alright where are we at?  You're not in the mood right?  I don't want to fight right now  Where are we at though?  He's not trying to have him  I'm still trying to find the track listing  All I care about is the radio show  Which is fucking horrible right now  Because of?  E-Rock not answering our questions properly  Yeah  We just wanted to do the exclusive E-Rock phoner  That everybody's been waiting for  I thought it was a nice phoner  I thought  Then we find out where he's driving to  I'm assuming he's driving to his brother's house  Trying desperately to get there 
[02:49:30]  To see what he could do  Find out which blimpies are open in Jersey  We've not heard from Pat  To answer a listener's question  No  I hope he's alright  I took out his trailer park  The floods  So Sal  We continue to wait here  I'm sorry  I can't find a track list  What are you doing?  Stop futzing around  I'm not futzing around  I'm trying my best man  I'm really trying here  Alright but some people would say  Okay I don't know if I'm going to get this in time  I know you're just babbling  Wasting time so  I got something even better to put on 
[02:50:00]  I have my own idea  Something like that  Yeah  So where are we at?  What do you say?  You think you're feeling the pressure  Sitting in this fucking seat  While that guy behind the scenes is fumbling  Yeah quit it  You want to feel real pressure?  Yeah  Let me go over there and fumble  And then you make shit up  Pull it out of your asshole as you wait  At the end of the day  Sal's name isn't on that wall  Is it Opie?  That's right  I have some other Patrisse bits  Some Patrisse productions  Productions 
[02:50:30]  Yeah  Like movies?  Wait but what happened to  I'm pulling it up now?  Yeah  Didn't work out  How'd you find all this other stuff?  What happened to the  I'm pulling it up now thing?  Where was that kid?  Where'd that eager kid go?  I can play the side pussy song  Would you guys like to do that to break?  No  Did he lie about pulling it up now?  I think he did  Pulling what up now?  I'm sorry  I'm so lost right now  I'm just using your words  You said I'm pulling it up now  When I asked for a certain track  From Elephant in the Room  Wait 
[02:51:00]  Shh  Oh  Hello?  Tell Sal  The comedy folder  There's Chase O'Neill stuff there  Under XM Jock and Delight  It's the last time Sal makes fun of E-Rock  E-Rock just schooled him  That's right  Do you hear that?  That was  Did you hear what he said Sal?  There's no official track listing  I cut the special up myself  So it should be numbered by  1, 2, 3, 4, all of that  Wow  Do you see it?  Just stay with us E-Rock  Until we get a play  E-Rock  Can we ask him if we can continue 
[02:51:30]  With our exclusive interview?  And E-Rock  Before Sal gets the tracks on the air  Can we continue with the interview  A little bit?  I am not looking for a blimpies  I am not driving around  I am sitting in my car here  Trying to charge my phone  How much is he charging it?  He's scared we're going to talk badly  About what he's in his car  E-Young-O  E-Young-O  No he didn't  You're still there  I'm not here  Okay great  Why wouldn't you go back inside?  People like start their car up  Just fucking lock the door  And let the phone charge 
[02:52:00]  No?  And what happened about  What happened with the big rescue?  I'll tell you why  He's got the air conditioning on  Oh  He's enjoying the comforts of the car  Ask him what happened with the big rescue mission  What happened with your big rescue mission  That you was going to take a week off work for?  My big rescue mission  Ah you're such an asshole  Yeah I mean  I hope he said there was a text  Did he hang up again?  Yeah  No  Yeah  There was a rescue mission  I had to wait for them to get rescued 
[02:52:30]  And then I was going to get them  And help them out  They just lost their fucking health  So he could  Oh so he could have been here today  The bottom line is  He could have been there  Did the ice cream melt or not?  There's no ice cream  You ate it all?  Ask him is it safe to say  That you probably could have made it into work today  The question that's on everybody's mind  If you're waiting for your brother to be rescued  Before you can help out  If you're waiting for your brother to be rescued  Before you can help out  Is it a safe assumption?  Is it safe to say  That you could have made it into work today? 
[02:53:00]  That I could have made it into work today?  Yeah  Yeah it's safe to say  That you're not needed there  I can't once until they clear the streets  The streets are not cleared  Well he could have just got a hotel yesterday if he cared  I mean you could have stayed at a hotel  Nice hotels in Times Square  Yeah I'm not leaving my  I wasn't leaving my wife alone during the hurricane  Sorry  She could come too  Jess and me are having a ball in that room 
[02:53:30]  Balling  I'm sure you are  If the streets aren't cleared  How did he get his treats?  Well the hotel doesn't take pets either so  And the other question is  If the streets aren't clear  Then how on earth did you get all those treats?  Uh huh fun  Is it taking this long for Sal to find the material?  Sal back to you  I've had it  I've had it for a while  Well maybe you should have told somebody  Yeah  No I'd rather watch Eric get thrown under the bus a little bit  Jesus  Eric just came and saved Sal 
[02:54:00]  Why don't you tell Eric what happened there  Because he can't hear all of us  Did you hear where  Oh no you can't  You heard Sal  I can't hear anything  Right  I know  That's funny  Sal said  Obi said  Well why wouldn't you have told us that you had it  And Sal said  No no  I've had it for a while  I was just enjoying  E-Rock getting thrown under the bus again  Yeah  When who told him where it was?  That would be you Eric Nagel  There you go  Join the rest of your show  And stormtrooping  I'll talk to you later  Are you going to come back 
[02:54:30]  Will you be in by early December?  Are you coming back before the new year?  I don't know  I want to know if he was taking an axe to all the trees  To get to his favorite fast food restaurant  Just haxing his way through the streets  Alright Sal  A number seven awaits  A number seven awaits  Right  Sal are we ready for track two of Elephant in the Room?  Yes  Track two is entitled  Uneven Racism  No that's not the one 
[02:55:00]  That's not the one  That's what track two is  Eric said it was  What's the one that has something to do with like  Natural disasters  Tsunamis  That type of thing  Just read the track names to us  Maybe it is that one  Read all the track names  In order?  No  Just mix it up  Okay  My days are numbered  Terrible question  Understanding men  Foo ball  Value of  White versus black girls  My violent thoughts toward women  Uneven racism  We can't harass women 
[02:55:30]  Being a woman is unfair to you  Safe sex is a woman's responsibility  My girl cares about my health  Woman  Woman love  Men like  Animal abuse  I love my dogs  Killer  Sorry  Animal abuse  I love my dogs  Killer because  You love her  There's no excitement in his voice  Is there  It's just  Killer's no possessed  None  I just got an ounce of charisma  That is getting really sad  Why?  Because of the listing  Yeah  Yeah  Try track two 
[02:56:00]  The great Patrice O'Neil  Will continue  I hate how much fun  Black people can have  Racially man  It's just  I can say anything  I goddamn want  Racially  And white people  Have to sit there  Take it  I am evil  Yes  It's like  Come on man  I don't even say it  Because of that  I love  I love a little racial  Look man  You know  Let's be fair  I mean  Honestly be nicer  With the racial game  I mean  I like to talk to 
[02:56:30]  You know  White people about  Being honest about  Obama  You gave it a shot  You did  You gave it a two year shot  Like oh yeah  I tried  I tried to  We tried to  But you  You're not  It's not  It's just  It fell apart  It really  It really did  And I'm going to tell you  Something you don't know  About black folks  We would be on your side  In talking to white people  We would be on your side  A lot more  If you would  You know 
[02:57:00]  Just not ever talk  About how you feel  About anything  Racial  We'll catch up to you  Now serious  Because black people  On the edge  Of going  What the fuck  Is Obama doing  But it's too many  White people  Outwardly hating him  So we can't  We go  If you shut the fuck  You shut up  I'll be against him  Like stop  I'm having rallies  And all kinds  Stuff  I'm telling you  I'm this close 
[02:57:30]  To  I'm mad at him  Because I thought  I would have  A white slave  But I thought  I thought it was  Vengeance day  I thought I had me  A white family  A big old fat  White girl  Go warm my bed up  Get upstairs Susan  Warm my bed up  Feed my baby  With your giant  White titties  I'm gonna go outside  And stare your husband  In the face  And decide whether  I'm gonna sell him  Or not  And you know 
[02:58:00]  Your wife's upstairs  Warming up my bed  You know that right  Phillip  That's uncomfortable  Ain't it  That's uncomfortable  I apologize  That's uncomfortable  Can't we move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  We'll move on  They don't even  Like that in play  That's uncomfortable  Right  To think about that  But you know  What you gonna do  This is the

[03:00:30]  Are we trying to figure out the heroes today, Sam?  I mean, Sal picked this.  Sal, why the hero song?  This is a very special song for this channel.  I like the song.  It's a good song.  That's it?  I believe Sal should make a list of everybody who's a hero today.  Yeah, you got a hero list today?  A hero list?  Yeah, you want to be in radio, right?  Yeah.  Some form?  All right, so make it up as you go.  Let's go.  Yeah, who are the heroes of the day?  Hero list. 
[03:01:00]  I'd say...  In no particular order, so no one's feelings are hurt.  That's right.  I'd say Ope, Jim.  No, but you gotta just name in names.  Who cares?  Watch what I do.  Hero list.  Sam, Kenny.  Means nothing, Sal.  I'll put that on the hero list.  You gotta, like, say a name and why.  Yeah.  The heroes are...  Yes, Kenny.  The hero is Opie for not turning on Kenny's microphone.  The heroes are all the emergency service workers...  They're called first responders.  ...sacrificed and, you know, have been working so hard and diligently. 
[03:01:30]  I disagree.  I think Sal's list was better.  Yeah.  Opie and Jim.  I heard Kenny having a conversation outside the studio saying how scared, how scary it  was driving in today.  I heard Kenny...  That's the real Kenny.  You were scared, right, Kenny?  It was dark out there.  I said that to my wife.  You don't like the dark?  Are you scared of the dark?  It was spooky.  There's no cars on the road.  I drove by roadblocks. 
[03:02:00]  I went around trees and wires down.  I fully expected to try to figure out how to get here today.  I even...  I have a car.  I just wasn't sure the garage was open.  And I woke up to this.  I'm at your residence waiting.  He just has a way of saying things.  Who says I'm at your residence waiting?  Death.  That was at 4.58 a.m.  I had to go over to the Polanski Skyway, if anybody on the East Coast is familiar with 
[03:02:30]  that.  Is that scary?  It's a big bridge in darkness in a fucking hurricane.  But you figured out that that was open.  Yeah.  That was my only choice.  It was the turnpike was closed.  Yeah, I like that.  All right, Sal.  Your list.  You had plenty of time.  Well, I think I'd say, you know, you because you have a newborn and you came in and still  did a show with all this that's going on.  Nice.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, well, Jimmy's providing a lot of entertainment as well, and he makes us laugh.  And the other thing is that there's a lot of people looking for new media today. 
[03:03:00]  Everyone's seeing the same bullshit, you know, on the TV, like, okay, the fucking crane,  we get it.  You know, people look to you guys.  Yeah, the fucking crane, we get it.  Yeah.  Something that's going to topple over at any moment.  Yeah, we're past that story.  So people, you know, people want to hear your take on the current events.  We need to hear.  We didn't do any current events.  We got hit with a storm and we can't even get.  We don't have stories because we don't have phones or nothing.  Iraq's the only guy we could go to.  And then you see how that worked out.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, people got to hear your trooping stories. 
[03:03:30]  And I think everyone, you know, people might get involved with that now.  Yeah.  People might be a little bit more.  Water's weird.  CNN's got the guy, the reporter that was in the streets of Atlantic City last night.  And now he's in the exact same spot.  I know he is.  And it's completely dry.  That's so fucked up, isn't it?  It moves.  It evaporates.  I get stuck in basements and all that.  That's what sucks.  But why is he on a completely dry road now?  Water is the mystery of life. 
[03:04:00]  Jimmy, you're tuckered out.  I'm fucking pooped.  Water comes and it goes.  It went back into the ocean?  Yeah, it recedes.  I guess it's a mystery.  Water's here today, gone tomorrow.  It is a mystery.  It's a very, very elusive house guest.  I'm kind of bummed we're not going to be able to, like, tool around town and see what  else is going on today.  I don't think we're going to find anything.  Yeah.  There's no traffic.  Yeah, but where can we go? 
[03:04:30]  Where's the shit at right now?  In Manhattan, because we can't really get off this island.  Yoshi just texted me.  What are you saying?  He wants to make sure you're okay?  Yeah.  He's an L.A. guy.  He's not over here.  Me too.  Are you okay, comma, Kenny, question mark?  Personally, I think Kenny is a hero.  Yes.  Because nobody could make it into this city.  Everybody said, well, if you're in the city, you're in.  If you're not in the city, you're not.  Right.  Kenny is the one guy who could travel from New Jersey to New York City. 
[03:05:00]  Right.  But Jimmy is a hero, because not only was he able to come in and entertain, but he  was also able to get his balls drained in the middle of a hurricane.  And not that many people can pull that off.  That should be the definition of hero.  Right.  I'll put it to you this way.  That should be the new definition of hero.  Yes.  I'll tell you what time she arrived.  Okay.  This is what she craved.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  You called her at 6-11, I think you said.  Texted her, yeah.  Texted her.  So, I think the hurricane officially hit around 8.  Hold on one second. 
[03:05:30]  Let's see.  Oh, wait.  Let me see.  I'll tell you in a second.  Okay.  Hold on.  Opie is a hero for the reporting that he's done.  I mean, he's given us angles on the hurricane.  Selfless, Sam.  Selflessly given us angles on the hurricane with his photography and trooping that nobody  is privy to.  Arrived at about 8.40.  That, I, it couldn't be more perfect.  That was basically the heart of it. 
[03:06:00]  Look at the hurricane.  The hurricane was happening.  Did that make your rod extra turgid, knowing that she was in the middle of the fucking...  I couldn't have had a fucking better heart on it.  Hide in the storm?  I couldn't have had a better heart on it.  I couldn't have.  Has the wind's howling around you?  Fucking, my cock was ready for action.  Fuck the storm.  That's great.  Good for you.  Was your erection medicated?  No.  Oh. 
[03:06:30]  Natural, firm.  Well, then that makes you a double hero.  Turgid, tumescent pole.  And, of course, E-Rock's a hero, because who else?  No, no.  He eats them.  Could find a blimpies.  He's during this storm.  We have a little update on the phones.  Oh, we were right there.  You're right in my face.  What kind of weather is this?  What is this right now?  I got two words for you, Stephanie.  Brew-towl.  Brew-towl.  People lost their homes. 
[03:07:00]  I'm so glad you had a barn on Battery Park.  That's why I was looking for a minute.  What an asshole.  Listen, it's our job to be out here.  I get it.  I shouldn't complain.  But after a few hours of, you know, the sopping wet and the 50, it's that.  Let's go there and not go into the Hudson River.  You know what?  Bet your pussy and ass stinks from being in that fucking outfit all day.  All I could say is.  In that rain suit.  Better you than us, Steph.  Better you than us.  I love the good nature of Josh.  You know, it's just great.  50 people lost their homes.  E-Rock's family stuck on the second floor. 
[03:07:30]  But you're getting a little rain in your face, Steph.  Don't give me snow, because that rain where, you know, the boys and the 50.  Oh, shut up.  Why, it's Steph.  We were down there.  I mean, it was an eye-opener to see these guys doing these same reports you're seeing  and then going on their phones to check their Twitters.  They sat down on a bench just chilling.  They did that a little bit.  We were all laughing and making fun of the jet skier.  And then, of course, the camera went on, and that lady from NBC had to make believe it was a big deal.  Even though minutes earlier when the camera was off, she was right with us being cool about it. 
[03:08:00]  Do you realize there's a hurricane coming, sir?  They did that a little bit on the CBS local news.  Like when I said that they were just, you know, those people were just in the newsroom all day long.  Right.  They'd go to a wide shot, and you could see the weatherman just scrolling through his phone.  And then, obviously, somebody told him in his ear, you know, you're on camera, because real quick, you put his phone down.  Right.  And then once the camera hit him, he's dramatic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I guess that's their jobs.  Yeah.  If you want to call anybody, we can make outgoing calls on the phone now.  Oh, really? 
[03:08:30]  Well, we cannot receive any calls.  Really?  Which is pretty much just as good as the speaker call.  I would suggest we call, um...  E-Rock.  I don't know.  Should we?  I think so.  I haven't heard from...  All right, Sal, if you...  I know you were having a conversation with him.  I haven't really been able to...  Okay, Sal's going to get E-Rock on the phone.  Jim, you'd like to show your concern, right?  Yes, I would.  I hope he's okay.  Are you all right over there?  I'm very tired.  Jesus, Jerry.  We got ten minutes. 
[03:09:00]  Did you stay up late last night?  It's funny you should ask.  Yes, I did.  I was watching The Office at one o'clock in the morning.  What were you doing before that?  You're the only guy that gets...  I can come off myself.  You're the only guy that gets blown and watches The English Office during a fucking major weather event.  The British Office is just a masterpiece.  What's up?  I just want to see the phone thing.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  That's okay.  We're good.  Good at 948. 
[03:09:30]  Thanks.  Thanks for that.  We got to go.  On the most important day to go to the phones.  Right.  I get it.  Some days we shouldn't go to the phones.  Today was a phone day.  Yes.  Today was a phone day.  Are we calling him now?  People experiences.  Are we calling the E-Rock?  Who's on the phone?  Yes.  Sal is pulling double duty in there.  Okay.  Which is...  I want to make sure he's okay.  Still half the work of a normal person.  Looks like we got somebody on hold. 
[03:10:00]  Line 1.  I can't do anything.  Where's the phone mouse?  What do you mean?  Over here?  It's probably eating phone cheese.  I think you got to pick it up old school.  All right.  My phone's a shot.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Good evening.  Hello?  Hello, Joshua?  Hello?  Joshua?  Joshua?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, the phone's potted up.  Yeah, the phone's potted up.  Don't question my fucking skills.  I know.  I know.  He knows how to pot them up. 
[03:10:30]  I got the buttons pushed.  I got the pot up.  Hello?  Something happened.  I heard something.  Hello?  Didn't that guy just come in and say it was good?  Wait.  Hello?  Hello?  He's on that speaker.  Eric.  What is Sal saying?  Sal, tell everybody.  Share with everybody.  He's trying to fix the phones again.  There's still an issue.  I thought it was okay, but it's not okay.  I'm going to redial Eric right now.  Who are you to decide that they're okay?  Hey, who are you fucking... 
[03:11:00]  Who are you, Mr. Phone?  What are you?  Hey, by the way, when are we getting our new mic share?  Great question.  That is a good question.  I don't know.  You see this...  Yeah, I guess the phones aren't working there.  You see this Bubba the Love Sponge apology?  No, I don't...  You don't care, do you?  No.  It's all just nonsense.  It is.  I really don't give a fuck.  I'm getting word from the back that Bloomberg is updating New York at either 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Is it working out?  Anyone else getting these calls?  All-inclusive cruise to Nassau, Bahamas in exchange for your answers.  No.  Sam, take that.  I can't hear right now.  Oh, God, that's fucking annoying me.  Wait, what happened now?  You have to be the one to put it on the air.  Okay.  All right, yeah.  So do we have to call him back?  Eric's on line two.  Okay, he's on line two.  All right, hit it.  Okay.  E-Rock.  Hey, how are you?  How come it looks like this instead of the...  Hello? 
[03:12:00]  Oh, boy.  Okay, it has to be off the hook.  Eric?  Eric?  No, he's not.  I've got to call him again.  Okay, so I was going to call him again.  But I think, like, at least we're getting the right icon.  All right, Sal, you call him again, and then we'll see if it works.  All right.  We want to make sure he's okay.  I haven't been able to talk to him today.  My pal.  You like E-Rock like that?  Yeah.  Met him at a Cracker Barrel in the middle of Florida on a fucking interstate.  Then you left him at a Rolling Stones concert.  Well, maybe.  He probably loved that meal, though. 
[03:12:30]  He loves Cracker Barrel.  He did like it.  And Opie.  He liked me back then.  I don't know what happened.  You abused him.  Do the Stock Exchange really have water?  That's what they said.  No.  They said yes, and they said no.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I didn't think that was possible.  All right.  All right.  We'll be back.  Here we go.  E-Rock.  Eric?  E-Rock Radio.  Did the guy come in here and stop our show by saying the phone was set?  And they're not set. 
[03:13:00]  Well?  Yeah, we got it.  E-Rock.  Hi.  How are you doing, buddy?  Hi.  We can't hear you.  You all right?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  How's the wife?  He's sleeping right now.  How are your cats?  Yeah, how are the cats?  The cats are fine.  Would you really?  Another tree just fell down.  Huh?  Another tree just fell down right next door.  Took out the power lines from the actual house, and they're just laying on the road. 
[03:13:30]  Fuck.  Don't touch them.  Ange has a lot of fucking trees to cut up later.  Are you saying I do no work?  No, you do good work, but not that type of work.  Like in the kitchen and stuff.  Well, I don't know if he's good in the kitchen.  Like my...  Grow it in the street and let the county do it.  Good.  Cats are all right?  They weren't scared?  No, they were terrified, but we had them locked up.  You know why they were scared?  Because they're pussies. 
[03:14:00]  You didn't even say scaredy cats?  How's your brother doing?  I don't know.  They're sleeping right now.  I haven't heard from them since 7.30.  Well, where are they sleeping?  In a rowboat?  They're in Brooklyn right now.  Somebody's house.  Hmm.  Have you figured out...  Where are we going with this?  Actually, it was right here.  Yeah.  Eric.  Yeah.  It's hard to hear you. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  So, for the people that are just tuning in, what happened last night?  They're tuning in that didn't hear it half an hour ago?  Yeah.  I don't know if anybody didn't hear it, because our connection was awful on the stupid cell  phone.  Yeah, we weren't talking to you.  Well, I guess we were talking to you through the speakerphone, but...  Yeah.  I feel I'm falling for something, but okay.  Wait, what do you think you're falling for?  No, we asked you before on your cell phone.  You know how hack it would be to do a dumb bit?  Like, your brother actually was trapped on the second floor. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  And they wound up losing their house.  Is it actually the whole thing gone?  Well, it flooded up to the second floor.  Did they call the lost and found?  Why would you call the lost and found?  You said they lost their house.  Sometimes when you lose something, you check the lost and found.  How about you let Chip do the bad joke? 
[03:15:30]  I don't know, the reaction I'm getting in the studio, I don't think it was that bad.  It's ridiculous.  Well, what are they going to do, man?  That sucks.  I would say they lost their house.  Why don't they fucking go looking for it or something?  Yeah, how did they lose their house?  Doesn't the water...  Good one, Chip.  Thanks.  Doesn't the water just subside?  Resede?  It has at some points, but when you've got your...  The whole basement and the first floor is completely flooded, and they're on a beach area. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  So it's pretty hard to rebuild what was there.  I think we lost the connection somewhere.  I think we lost the connection somewhere.  That'll happen.  I don't know. 
[03:16:30]  The call got dropped, unfortunately.  Look, and I'm sitting over here.  Yeah.  Am I sitting over here, Kenny?  Kenny, of course, G.H., that's where you sit.  And where's the phone, Kenny?  Next to Sam.  That's right.  Next to Sam.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not exactly sure what happened.  We were having technical issues all day.  I'm over here.  The phone's over there.  Sam has custody of the phones.  Thank you, Kenny.  At the moment, I do, yes, but I mean, I wouldn't have... 
[03:17:00]  You know, it was such an inappropriate conversation.  The phone is next to Jim, too.  It's not like...  No, it's not.  It's closer to you.  But it's between me and Jim, and there was a long period of silence.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  Between Opie and in the phone conversation.  I mean, I thought it was fairly obvious that Opie was not sitting in his seat the whole time.  What?  What?  Yeah, I thought, I mean...  No!  I thought that the listeners could even pick up on that.  I thought it was pretty evident that Opie... 
[03:17:30]  Why would you say that?  Well, because you didn't talk, and then you walked over to where the phone is, and then  you grabbed the mic and said, hey, hey, E-Rock, as if to say, I haven't been on the air  for the last five seconds, because I've been walking around the table, so I can get next  to the phone and hang up on you.  You're a rat.  You should go live in the subways.  No, the rat's going to live in the subways anymore.  They're back.  Already?  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  All right, I think we're going to go home.  That's it?  Sure hope E-Rock and his family are okay and safe. 
[03:18:00]  Safe and safe.  I have a lot more radio to do.  Why?  Because I just have a bunch to say.  But you're tuckered out.  Good luck to you and yours, everybody.  But you're tuckered out.  Yes, I am.  So where are you doing all the radio?  I didn't mean it.  I want it to sound like you have to pull me off the air.  Okay.  I got one foot out the fucking door already.  I'm just tired, man.  Yeah, you guys could still talk for another hour.  Sam will, probably.  Yeah, I will.  Are Ron and Fez Anthony? 
[03:18:30]  I guess I'll make it.  I don't know.  Were they in the last show?  They were not in yesterday, no.  What happened?  They didn't make it in.  Oh.  Why are you making that face?  I'm not.  What happened?  I know that Pepper had some trouble getting in.  Because he lives in one of the boroughs.  But Fez?  Well.  Oh, he lives on that island, though.  That could have been a problem.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if they would do a show without Fez or not. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  It's not easy to do a show without Fez.  Yeah.  Right, Fez?  What are you laughing at?  It's just so uncomfortable and awkward.  Why?  Well, there's just words being said, and that would silence after it.  I mean, there could be double meanings or not.  He's been sitting here the whole time.  Who has?  We can't do a show without him, either.  Who? 
[03:19:30]  Fez.  He's been here the whole time?  The whole time, man.  Ask him.  He'll tell you.  Fez.  He'll fucking tell you.  Have you been here the whole time?  No, he'll tell you on Ron's show.  Oh.  He'll tell you, though.  You'll see.  All right, everyone.  I think we're going to go home.  Kenny's got to drive back to Jersey and find a hotel for his family.  No power yet, Kenny?  Negative.  No one has heard from Pat from Munaki.  I hope he's okay, but it doesn't sound like his trailer is.  Trailer got wiped out by this fucking levy that broke, I guess, huh? 
[03:20:00]  Anybody hear from him for real?  I have not, no.  I'm going to try to call him.  Yeah, that'd be good.  You can call him on this.  I'm going to go kiss my pillow.  Put my face in.  Me and Jimmy had fun yesterday, stormtrooping.  Yeah.  Stormtrooping was great.  Pictures are up everywhere.  But our pictures suck compared to everything else we've seen today.  Oh, how do I use it?  Sam, we didn't do well with our picture taking because there's very impressive pictures out  there right now.  You've got some good ones. 
[03:20:30]  So the jet skiing photo was good and the jet skiing video is good.  I think the jet skiing video is pretty good.  Yeah.  It's not going to go viral, but it's a thing that happened that I fucking captured.  I don't know.  The opester, you know, he tends to really try to get himself out there.  This one might be the one.  Really?  He doesn't say no.  He doesn't quit.  Really?  Never.  Where's 585?  Oh, that might be Wee's.  Hold on a minute.  585.  Pat didn't answer.  Hold on.  Let's see if this is the Wee.  That means he might bring up Terry Clifford.  It's Rochester. 
[03:21:00]  It is, right?  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Shouldn't we do this with the regular phone?  Yo, who's this?  This is Brooksy.  Yo, Brooksy, it's Opie.  You guys called me.  Oh, hey, hey, man.  Yeah, we wanted to talk to you for two seconds.  Oh, I don't want to talk to you.  We're busy.  Hold on.  Let me probably put you on hold real quick, okay?  All right.  Should we call, like, the other line?  Yeah, on the phone line.  This is...  Is there a plane in the Hudson River?  That's right.  What do we got?  Wait, we got the Opie.  Call me on the phone. 
[03:21:30]  We should call on the...  Wee's.  Are you on the radio?  Yes.  Yeah, I'm on the radio.  Can I call you back on the real phone?  Yeah, I feel bad, bro.  I don't want to bug you on the radio.  Trust me, we have nothing going on today.  We have a skeleton crew.  It's just me and Jimmy.  Give me, like, 30 seconds.  I'm going to call on the real phone.  So it sounds like radio.  All right.  Call his number.  We'll talk to the Wee's.  Okay.  5-8-5...  Is this a secret number?  Yeah.  All right, then maybe not out loud.  We'll have Sal write it down.  Jesus, Sal, hurry up. 
[03:22:00]  5-8-5...  He's taking his time.  He doesn't want to mess up his clothes.  5-4...  You're still saying the numbers, isn't he?  What?  The numbers you're saying are out loud.  7-4-2-7.  Those are still out loud.  What?  Don't say those numbers again.  What happened?  You said the numbers out loud as you were...  Oh, fuck.  Will I mess up our phone call?  It's going to make a cornucopia.  All right, Wee's wants to talk.  He wants to make sure we're all okay.  Sam, what are you going to talk about on your show? 
[03:22:30]  I don't have a clue.  Don't worry.  Maybe get the girls in here?  No, that's why we're taking the brother Wee's call, so you don't have time for the after  show.  I'm sorry.  I'm okay with that.  Are you really?  I mean, I've been on this show all day, right?  How do I avoid your wife now that she's mad at me because I didn't take her storm?  You know what I found out?  What?  She's going to your house later.  There's no avoiding her.  Why?  Because somebody invited her over.  Why?  Because I know what side your wife is on.  Why is Jimmy left?  It was funny.  What?  He said, why?  Oh.  Why is she coming?  Okay.  This is. 
[03:23:00]  We got the Wee's.  Try it.  Yo.  Opie, can you hear me?  I got you.  I'm going to try not to curse.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you very much.  Listen, the main reason, I don't want to bug you on the radio show, but I'm trying to  call every one of my relatives on Long Island, and you can't even call Long Island.  Oh, I know.  Long Island, I got a lot of family there, as you know, and they got hit.  Trees down everywhere.  Power lines down everywhere.  Have you called Long Island, though?  No, I'm just kidding.  You can text them. 
[03:23:30]  Oh.  You don't know?  You can text.  Like, all the mayors are on TV saying, look, you can text.  But you can't call.  I don't know.  Calling might be a little rough, but I've been getting text messages from my family all over  Long Island.  They're in the South Shore, right?  Well, I got a guy in Islip.  My father-in-law's in Islip, and the rest of the family's in West Hempstead.  How much do you care about Islip?  Let's not talk about it. 
[03:24:00]  Let's not talk about that.  But, Ope, what about your crib?  Did you get a view of any action?  Not really.  Well, I could see the crane that's dangling from my apartment.  Whoa.  But we were on the scene, me and Jim Norton, where we jumped in my vehicle, and we were  tooling around town right before the hurricane hit.  It was cool as all hell.  You frigging guy.  But I'm kind of embarrassed because we didn't really go through much.  We didn't lose electricity.  We didn't lose Wi-Fi. 
[03:24:30]  I'm texting and tweeting my butt off.  But I got to tell you, the building swayed so much.  Were you scared?  Yeah, a little bit.  I was a little scared.  But then Donald Trump Jr. personally writes me and says, don't you worry about a thing.  Those buildings are made to do that.  And then someone tweeted Donald Trump Jr. and said, well, how do you know that?  And then, of course, he said, well, I built the building that he lives in.  Well, let me say this, bro, because you know that I hate Donald Trump Jr. 
[03:25:00]  So I have to at least say this.  Did you know?  Oh, we made fun of him as well.  It's a weird thing because we really, really like his son, even though politically I don't  like him so much.  But I get along with the guy.  But, Wheeze, you like the fact you enjoy the Trump's offer for the president?  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  Wasn't that great?  Listen.  Yeah.  I just want to ask a question to find out if it's true or not.  The story went out on the line the day that he did the offer for the president that Jimmy's  talking about, that he was fired from where you live. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, there was some kind of conspiracy that he lost the, what is it called?  The management gig at your apartment.  Yeah, the management gig, which I would imagine is a lot of money.  Now, I don't know.  How many of those are, Opie lives in a place with Trump's name on the roof, right?  On its top.  Yeah, a whole bunch of them.  There's, I don't know, at least 12 buildings down there now.  Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out because-  12 skyscrapers.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  The news, I mean, I read this news report that he was voted out by the board and that 
[03:26:00]  his company did not manage him anymore, even though his name is on there, and you don't  know if it's true or not.  I thought that happened a while ago, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I never thought he owned him.  Yeah, I thought his name was still obviously on the building, but I thought he had nothing  to do with the buildings anymore.  Well, I just realized Jim Norton lives in one, too.  Yeah, he's my neighbor.  Yeah, I'm a gentleman.  But I got to tell you really fast, like, I'm walking around my apartment last night  as this thing's hitting, and I'm getting really lightheaded and dizzy and nauseous, and I'm 
[03:26:30]  like, what the heck's going on?  So I asked my wife, and she goes, yeah, I feel really sick.  And then I'm thinking, but then I'm thinking, well, what the heck?  Are we breathing in some gas?  So we checked all the gas lines and all that.  I'm like, what's going on here?  Because I lived in the suburbs my whole life, and then we finally figured out that the building  was swaying so much, I was getting seasick.  Well, I do want folks to know, Opie and Lindsay and their kids live on the 40th floor. 
[03:27:00]  This is what, I am so surprised you didn't flee, bro, because the news had you guys going  to get devastated.  Yeah, I know.  You're right there.  I know, I know.  On the 40th floor, and the water.  Supposedly the wind's up that high are over 100 miles an hour.  If it's like 50 on the ground, it's 100 up that high.  But it was swaying so much, I would love to know how much this building was swaying.  We filled up a bathtub, and the water was moving in the bathtub.  I'm out of that building, bro.  Yeah, but I got so sick, and that's the only story I got is people, we're looking at the 
[03:27:30]  news, 50 homes burnt to the ground in the Rockaways, people's houses flooded out.  One of our guys, his brother, was trapped on the second floor.  E-Rock's brother was trapped on the second floor with his family.  The whole house was flooded out.  The water was below, everything belonged.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So all that-  Yeah, those coastal towns along Island got screwed, man.  In Atlantic City.  What about, are the subways back open, or are they- 
[03:28:00]  Nah, they're saying it's going to take, they said four days, but Jimmy thinks it'll be a  little less than that.  Yeah.  But did you see the video of the water rushing into the battery tunnel?  No.  Oh, it's amazing.  CNN's showing it.  It's like a river going right into the battery tunnel.  Well, I hope you and Jimmy Norton stay dirty and be nasty and go drinking.  I mean, is this one of those things, at least, where the city, where if you go out and get  a few pops, it's a lot of fun.  People bond.  I like, usually when stuff like this happens, there's some fun involved.  I hate to say it.  Well, when I'm trying to get people to- I've been getting spam phone calls where a ship 
[03:28:30]  horn goes off from Seattle, and I'm out of my mind in a- I'm angrier about that than  I am about the stupid storm.  Yeah.  I like when this stuff goes down.  I really do.  It is.  We can't deny there's fun there, but I dig what Norton's saying, because someone's screwing  with you and screw that.  Right.  I saw you had a great trip to Aruba.  You had a killer trip to Aruba, bro.  You got to come sometime.  Bring the babies, even.  I'm crazy about it.  Yeah, right.  I'm going to be an old guy and retire there and sell timeshares. 
[03:29:00]  I like it.  No, but it's a ghost town.  It's really strange out there today.  I mean, there's nobody on the streets of Manhattan.  Well, that's got to be semi-interesting and cool, because it's something that doesn't happen.  Yeah, you got to walk home and just check it out.  You know what we were saying earlier?  It brings out the crazies.  The crazies that never leave their apartments for some reason when you got a situation like  this, that's when they hit the streets and walk around.  Hey, did you see any of this crap about people tweeting they were going to go looting?  No.  Well, I've got it here in front of me somewhere, and it has the quotes. 
[03:29:30]  Not that I necessarily believe them, but I do believe that there are people stupid enough  that are smart enough to run a computer that would say gangster stuff like that.  And there are quotes in this thing here.  I got it right here, actually, about guys going, this storm could be the best thing that  ever happened to me.  We're going looting.  Anybody want to go with this?  It's all New York stuff.  And I'll bet we all know something about those tweeters, don't we, Weez?  Wink, wink.  We, we, we know, we know something.  Shut up, Jimmy. 
[03:30:00]  I know where you're going.  Yeah, y'all know where I'm heading.  I know where you're heading, and we ain't going to head there.  But, you know, the sixth part about it is I agree, but I don't want to agree.  Yeah, I am.  I've been listening to you online lately, Weez.  You guys sound great.  Thanks so much, bro, because I'm working my balls off and fighting people higher up to  try and do a show.  Yeah, I understand.  We all understand.  They let you guys go.  You guys are the kings. 
[03:30:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show starring Jim Norton on the side.  It made you, what's the story with your boy?  Is he stuck out in his crib?  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony was, he didn't make it in from Long Island, power lines, trees down.  And half the staff was staying with him.  So, you know, we did.  We had days with him.  Yeah, well, they got flooded out of their houses.  So he's nice enough to give up his mansion.  No, he's lonely enough.  Yeah, he's lonely, and he needed someone to drink with.  Yeah.  Check this out real quick. 
[03:31:00]  These are quotes, supposedly, from a news source.  If this hurricane gets real bad, I'm looting stores.  I always wanted to do that.  Who wants to go looting with me when Sandy hits?  I need some new shiznit.  Nice.  About to do some looting when this hurricane finally hits.  Going to get a new laptop and a TV.  Hey, this hurricane might be the best thing to happen to me.  Those are supposedly legit tweets, which I believe completely.  Sure they are, because we all know who they're coming from, don't we?  We're out of here.  Thank you, O.  All right.  See you. 
[03:31:30]  Bye, Wies.  Bye, Wies.  Love you.  Sorry for Terry Clifford.  You heard that, right?  That's the official apology.  You heard that, right?  That counts.  All right, Sam's going to continue until 11 o'clock, then run a fez, and I'm sure we'll  have a full staff tomorrow, probably.  We'll see.  Why?  How bad is it out there?  I don't know.  It's pretty bad outside the city.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Everybody's just trying to pick up the pieces.  Well said, Jim.  And move forward. 
[03:32:00]  You know, when something like this happens, all you can do is sweep away yesterday's sorrows  and pick up the pieces, get moving.  I like that bass.  Yeah.  It's the way I talk.  It's my radio voice.  It's smooth.  Yeah.  You know, ladies and gentlemen out there, you can always call here.  We'll talk about...  You'll never find...  ...picking up the pieces.  Sounds like Lou Rawls.  Well, maybe he needed to pick up the pieces. 
[03:32:30]  Step forward.  Don't look back.  Step forward.  All right.  Can I walk home or is it raining?  I don't know, G.H.  It might not be advisable.  Why?  Look at your eyes.  It's very advisable.  You look like you're going to pass out.  It's raindrops.  How tired are you?  Keep falling on your head.  Look at his eyes.  You're not driving me home.  Yeah.  I tried to sleep last night, but people were texting me all night long.  How are you doing?  Why don't you turn your phone off, you OCD silly goose. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, you just turn your phone off.  Everything can wait for the morning.  No, what if you wanted to call me?  I wasn't going to call you.  It's just your OCD.  You're afraid of missing something.  Yeah.  What are you afraid of missing?  That's my greatest fear, not being there.  Our greatest fear is that you are.  Roland, any final thoughts, even though we should have went out on that line?  Don't fall back.  Just step ahead.  Stop talking like that.  Roland.  Roland, this is Roland, the talent booker for the Open Anthony show. 
[03:33:30]  What do you got?  I got nothing.  Yeah.  You have nothing?  I got nothing.  It was like the storm of our lifetime.  Wait.  What's for lunch, Roland?  I know who's going to have a big out for us.  What?  Sal?  Sal's got it.  Sal, what do you got, buddy?  Sal, wrap up Storm Talk.  I heard we wanted track three of Patrice's CD, by the way.  I'm hearing that it was not Elephant in the Room, but Mr. P.  Oh, is it Mr. P?  That was the mix-up.  Big misunderstanding.  You got the Mr. P? 
[03:34:00]  No, Sal has a big line to go out on.  He's got something, you know.  What do you got, Sal?  See you guys tomorrow?  No, that's not it.  You got to take us out, Sal.  This is radio.  And I think I've just found my new calling.  I bet your listeners are loving this.  Oh, yeah.  That they're not at all?  Yeah.  I've grown tired of it quite quickly.  I got bad dudes.  No more.  No more.  You're going to be stuck with this one for a long time. 
[03:34:30]  Sal, what's your big out?  Give it to us, Sal.  Big out.  And maybe even do a voice or something.  Yeah, do something smooth.  Please be, I quit.  Please be, I quit.  Please be, I quit.  Please be, I quit.  Hey, Roland.  Please be, I quit.  What's your big out?  What do you got?  I quit.  Can I do radio with people that don't know how to do it?  Yeah, it's tough.  He doesn't even really quit.  Kids got no pizzazz.  I know.  That's like...  I'm not into being on air.  Take us home, Puppethead.  Take us out, Puppethead.  Really? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Hey, you ought to say a hey.  Hit the button, Puppet, boy.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  All right, you've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Puppethead, after O.P. and Anthony Live is coming up next.  SiriusXM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now the O.P. and Anthony Show continues. 
[03:35:30]  This is after O.N.A. Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yes.  It's after O.P. and Anthony Live.  Looks like Governor Christie from Jersey is talking right now.  Do it and do it together.  I have confidence in the fact that we'll have complete support from the President of the United States and federal authorities.  How funny would it be if Obama just was like, no, you do not have complete support from me or the rest of this country, Jersey.  Take care of your own problems. 
[03:36:00]  When I talk to the President later today, I can tell him personally exactly what I've seen to give him the full measure of the devastation that's happened to our state.  No question am I, given the reports that I've seen so far, that the devastation that's happened to New Jersey is beyond what's happened to anyone else, at least from the reports that I've seen so far.  And that should come as no shock since the storm made landfall here.  All right, we're going to break away.  Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, obviously exhausted, laying it out in stark terms for all to hear. 
[03:36:30]  The damage done to his state, unthinkable, worse than anything he thought he'd ever see in his lifetime.  How is that possible?  They said the damage is going to be unthinkable.  So then when you get unthinkable damage, that damage becomes thinkable.  No?  I mean, if you predicted the worst damage ever, and then you get the worst damage ever, it's not like, oh my god, who saw this coming?  It's like, okay, yeah, this was as bad as we thought it was going to be. 
[03:37:00]  But everybody's talking about Hurricane Sandy, of course.  I can't believe it didn't really hit Midtown Manhattan at all.  It was bad all over the place.  I still haven't been back to Westchester.  I haven't been back to Westchester since Sunday.  But, I don't know.  Jess is over there on the computer.  There's flooding on the 86th Street subway.  I wanted to show you a picture.  Oh, yeah.  Is it bad? 
[03:37:30]  Really bad.  Yeah, that's the big deal now, I think.  I think that we lucked out because it looks like, if you look out a window, it really doesn't look that bad anymore.  And we lucked out because the rain and the wind is not going to come in like they thought it was going to.  But what was even worse than they thought was all the surging, is what they call it, when water comes from the rivers and the lakes and everything, and the tide goes up.  Wow.  How high up is that?  It looks like over the spot where you stand to wait and queue for the... 
[03:38:00]  Oh, my God.  That's right.  The yellow part.  Okay, so what we're looking at here is a picture of the 86th Street subway station.  This is where it's going to be really bad because I think the bad weather part is done.  But in terms of opening stuff back up again, this picture that we're looking at is at the 86th Street subway station here in New York.  And the water is actually so far up that the track part is full of water, and it's over where you stand. 
[03:38:30]  So you know when you're in a subway station and you're standing there, and the part that the subway is actually on is far lower than you actually are?  It's over that, and it's over where you stand.  That's where that yellow line is.  Holy Toledo.  And that's what...  It wasn't even a lot of rain.  It just all came in from the Hudson River, I guess, and the East River.  So, I mean, I don't know when the roads are going to open.  I don't even know if the roads are bad here.  And I think that there's another tide surge later this evening, or no? 
[03:39:00]  Well, I mean, there's, like, high tide comes every 12 hours.  So you'd think...  But, you know, it's getting better and better.  I think the last high tide was, like, 9 this morning.  Maybe it's not every 12 hours.  Maybe it's every 6 hours.  I don't know for sure.  But the storm is definitely moving way quicker than they said.  And it's not just sitting there like they said it would.  But the tides are ridiculous.  My God. 
[03:39:30]  Sal, are you glad you made it in today?  I loved it.  It was awesome.  Is there a lot of pressure sitting in that EROC seat?  It is.  That's where you were all day.  And considering there was a fucking dozen technical problems, like...  Well, yeah, I mean, to say, so today's show, not only were we short-staffed, because the  only people here are me, Sal, Troy, and Roland.  So it's everybody that was here yesterday is not here.  They were replaced by those who weren't here yesterday.  And we didn't have Ant today, which is the biggest loss to the show, by far. 
[03:40:00]  We also didn't have our phones working.  We still don't have our phones working, correct?  We can only call out.  Yeah, so at least you don't have to worry about finding a phone screener for me.  It's like we're in the fucking Amish country or something.  And actually, I don't think the Amish can make phones either way.  No?  No, I don't think they can make calls or receive them.  And what else did we not have?  We didn't have Dillette.  Dillette is our system that contains all of our material.  Yeah, we got Dillette around 9.30, which is great.  Perfect.  Yeah, perfect.  And then the guy comes in here, the engineer comes in here at 9.48, and he's like, 
[03:40:30]  Good news, everybody!  Everybody, can I have your attention?  We got phones!  We got phones, so I fucking, I dial Eric.  Yeah.  You go to pick up the phone here, hangs up on Eric.  And Eric's starting to get pissed off at me.  He's like, what are you doing?  He thinks I'm, like, intentionally doing it.  I don't understand.  The way Eric was treated on the show today, why not?  On Earth, he would be pissed off about anything.  It's ridiculous.  I don't understand that either.  Apparently, E-Rock is going to be out maybe tomorrow, too, because his family is in trouble.  But also, his ice cream all melted, so I don't know which one is a bigger personal tragedy 
[03:41:00]  for him, but he's dealing with both those things.  You stayed in a hotel last night, though.  I did.  What made you decide, I got to get in there?  I just knew that something like today was going to happen.  It was going to be a very, like, bear crew, so I figured I might as well.  And you were like, do you think it would have been bad if you hadn't been here?  Like, do you think it would have been an even worse phone call today than it was yesterday?  Oh, my God.  Because you could also tell today we didn't have any phones. 
[03:41:30]  There's nothing going on in the news except this hurricane.  So it's like, you know, I got to start talking about Jess or something.  We got to be...  You got to start talking about me.  You brought me up too many times today on the show.  Well, I'm trying to bring up everybody.  Troy was included on the show today.  I feel like we all got to do our part.  I can't be in here, you know.  Hope and Jim are doing their part.  I'm in here.  Well, let's get everybody in here.  You know what I mean?  But, yeah, I think today would have been nasty for you if you hadn't come in.  Oh, shit, yeah.  I jumped in a cab within minutes of that phone call yesterday. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, well, the funny thing was that we left here not too long after the show.  Like, I was here less than an hour after the show yesterday because everybody was just trying to get out of here.  And today, I mean, it is a ghost town here.  I don't even have any fun, like, weirdos who work here that I can pull in.  That fucking guy Dennis is here.  Dennis is here, sure.  But, yeah, yesterday everybody was just trying to get out of here.  And we get out of here right before noon or so.  And Sal is rushing in, coming up the elevator.  And I'm like, Sal, it's a little late.  Like, I don't think this is going to make up for it. 
[03:42:30]  Well, I couldn't access my email.  At all.  At all.  So I figured I have to come here first.  And then I went to the hotel, met up with Roland, hung out with him for a bit.  Did you have fun at the hotel?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Yeah, it's fun.  It's fun hanging out with Roland.  We explore.  We went down to, like, the west side.  Were you upset that you didn't get called up for the stormtroopers mission?  I was, actually.  You wanted to do that.  Deeply upset.  I don't know if Opie understood.  Because Jess was saying to me in the office, she goes, you didn't even tell me about that text message.  Opie texted me saying, here's the text I got from Opie. 
[03:43:00]  Because he was obsessing about this storm.  First of all, it's not stormtrooping.  It's storm chasing.  I don't know why he started calling it that.  It's funny.  But, is it?  Yeah.  He started, this was the text I got from him.  Um, uh, this is all it was.  Nice.  I'm gonna be, I'm gonna, he wrote, I'm gonna giving drive around.  That's what it says here.  I'm gonna giving drive around. 
[03:43:30]  That's a great offer.  Which I assume meant I'm gonna be driving around.  And I was like, oh, okay, so that's what he's doing.  Not like, hey, you should come stormtrooping with me.  Plus, I didn't want to drive around.  And now I'm getting, now I'm getting texts from Edgar that says, shut up.  Shut up.  You can't go stormtrooping.  I didn't want to go.  It wasn't appealing to me to be like, oh, I'll get in the truck with Opie and I'll help him film videos. 
[03:44:00]  Like, I didn't want to do it.  It's raining, it's, it's like, I want to walk around Times Square because it's empty.  Like, that sounds cool.  But I could do that for like, half an hour and then be back in the hotel.  Dry, nice, safe.  Plus, Jess is already, already here.  And I, and now Edgar's texting me, Jessica is a girl of lower stock, so she can't storm Trump.  Does it bother you, Jess, when Edgar says you're a girl of lower stock?  Yeah, I don't know how he has any idea what kind of stock I am. 
[03:44:30]  It does bother you.  Who, Jim's asked me this before.  Of Jim's characters, there's Edgar and Uncle Paul and Chip Chipperson and Josh Good-Naturedly and Valley Chip and Valley Jim.  Radio Jim today.  Radio Jim is the new one.  Sounds tiring to be Jim.  It's gotta be exhausting.  And he, like, he doesn't break character.  You saw him in the picture with Opie.  He's in the middle of a storm.  He's doing the chip phase.  Which is your least favorite?  That one.  Which one?  Edgar?  Edgar.  You hate Edgar. 
[03:45:00]  I hate Edgar.  Why?  Because he insults you?  He's so rude.  Yes.  You don't like when he's...  He really doesn't like me.  No.  He constantly says you have a...  Jessica is...  And I've never met him in person.  No, you haven't.  It's always through you.  Well, he doesn't like talking to you, I suppose.  I know.  Edgar.  But yeah, so I didn't...  And people were tweeting me because they heard Jez on the after show yesterday.  And they could tell that she was not looking forward to spending another night in the city.  All Jez wants to do is... 
[03:45:30]  All Jez wants is for the two of us to get in my car and drive home.  Yes.  That's all you're looking for.  Yes, please.  Well, how come you don't want to stay in the city?  How come you don't want to be in the hotel?  I just want to...  I don't know.  The comforts of home, I guess.  You just want to be...  I think anyone can appreciate that.  You just want to sleep in your own bed, be around your own things.  Have my own blow dryer.  Yes.  Yeah.  Take care of whatever it is you need to take care of.  Yes.  I guess a blow dryer is an important thing.  I thought all blow dryers were the same.  No.  No.  That was silly of me.  Why would I have thought that? 
[03:46:00]  But so, yeah.  So, and plus, we didn't really pack.  It's not like we were planning on...  We just came in for the Sunday show.  Remember that?  You said, grab an extra shirt just in case.  Yeah.  I was like, all right.  I came in here on Sunday afternoon to do the show.  I haven't been able to go home since.  It feels much longer, then.  It doesn't feel like Tuesday.  It honestly feels longer.  Yeah, it does.  It feels a lot longer because we haven't been able...  And we can't do anything because everything in the city is closed.  So, I'm like, listen.  I think the best thing... 
[03:46:30]  Because I don't specifically want to go storm-trumping or however they were saying it today over and over and over again.  And Jess is already like, you know, I feel bad because Jess is stuck in the city.  And you'd rather be at home.  Yeah, we have to take care of our freezer.  And so, yeah, you know, freezer, look at our cat, just do all the little things.  So, I'm like, you know what?  I think I'm just going to hang out in the hotel with Jess.  Like today, I think Troy is moving into our hotel.  So, we'll all hang out in the hotel.  It'll be fun.  I'm looking forward to that. 
[03:47:00]  Right.  Because it's just a chill time.  It's not like running around...  And it's a nice hotel.  ...with the opster trying to get a viral video.  Trying to get somebody in the middle of a hurricane to make some kind of basketball trick shot.  Or look for a dramatic squirrel somewhere.  Or find some fat kid to play Star Wars in a video room.  We can't...  I don't know what's going to happen.  And you certainly don't have the right shoes for anything like that.  I have canvas Chuck Taylors.  That's all I have.  That's all I have in this world.  It's all I need.  Me and my Chucks.  All I need... 
[03:47:30]  Chip is now texting in.  Oh.  Tis.  Blow dryer.  Tis.  He liked that one.  He's wrong with him.  Blow dryer.  Like blow, you know.  Yeah.  Like a perverted joke.  Did he ever get my thank you note for his wedding gift?  I don't know.  I think we talked about this a few months ago.  When Jess and I got married, we were going through all the cards.  And you know, when you get married, like that's a fun thing you do.  You get to go through all the cards and find out what people gave you.  And count those checks. 
[03:48:00]  Watch those numbers add up.  And so we're going through.  And I get to one envelope.  And the names on the...  Edgar's texting in.  It says, tell her to shut up and do her duty.  What is my duty?  I don't know what your duty is.  My grandmother's calling me.  I have to go.  Okay.  Go answer from your grandmother.  I hope she's doing well.  But we're going through envelopes.  And we arrive with one envelope.  The names are misspelled on it. 
[03:48:30]  It's written in ballpoint pen.  There's a coffee stain on the corner of the envelope.  That's the amount of detail that is put into this.  There's a coffee cup stain on the corner of it.  And even though the envelope is sealed, there's packaging tape.  This is for a wedding.  There's packaging tape lining the seal of it.  So we finally get it open.  And it's like this dumb card for a kid's birthday.  And it's from Chip.  And there's $1.43 in the card. 
[03:49:00]  The card's jingling when you shake it.  Because there's $1.43 in it.  And so, yes.  Jess, being the wonderful person that she is, wrote a thank you note.  Not only to Jim Norton for his gift.  But to Chip Chipperson for his gift as well.  So, that's what's going on.  Is Chris Christie saying something new?  Let me see this.  Today.  But it is good news that the parkway was not structurally damaged by the flooding that occurred. 
[03:49:30]  And that we were able to have the engineers verify that was okay.  And to reopen the entire length of it.  And as soon as we get, you know, we've got cranes moving those rail cars off of the New Jersey turnpike.  As soon as we move them off, you know, I think we'll be able to do the same kind of testing on the turnpike.  And if it's structurally sound, we'll be able to reopen that portion of the turnpike.  Wow.  Okay.  So they're saying that what they're doing is this is Jersey.  This is Chris Christie from New Jersey.  And he has said that the Garden State Parkway, I think he said first, is structurally sound. 
[03:50:00]  I didn't even realize they were testing on that level.  But he said the turnpike, there are rail cars on it for some reason.  I don't know if they got blown there or something.  I don't know what they're doing there.  Maybe they're just always there.  But he said they got to remove the rail cars and then find out if this highway is structurally sound or not.  Oh, my God.  So, I mean, that may be what they have to do with, like, the West Side Highway and all that.  I don't know where Bloomberg is.  Why would Bloomberg let this...  Although the Tappan Z is reopened.  I saw that.  It is.  Why would Bloomberg let this Chris Christie get the leap on him?  You know, it's in New York, then. 
[03:50:30]  Wastewater treatment plants that are compromised, too, for the very same reasons.  Ew.  Wastewater treatment plants.  That means there's doo-doo water all over Jersey.  That's gross.  Some significant headlines from Governor Christie at this hour saying...  Yeah, whatever.  We're all just trying to get by here.  But Obie was right in saying that it was kind of a bummer, or I don't know if it was...  You feel guilty not having a big hurricane story. 
[03:51:00]  Like, I guess there's like, oh, we were stranded in New York City.  We couldn't get out.  Yeah, but you were in, like, a beautiful hotel in the middle of Times Square where there was barely any wind.  You didn't lose power at all.  And you got to check out Times Square when, like, there was nothing happening.  We were outside in Times Square while nobody was there, which never happens.  And it was just a little rain.  Obie is now texting in with a question.  That's the only way we have to communicate with you guys today, because there's no phones.  Obie is texting in with a question. 
[03:51:30]  He wants to know, do you think E-Rock is consuming right now?  I would have to believe that yes.  I would think E-Rock is probably consuming right now.  But I will tell you, he's probably not happy with that question.  I also heard that Kenny has taken a liking to Troy's lady friend who was here today.  He was back there.  I guess he's given Jess a break, maybe because there were two girls here. 
[03:52:00]  I know, he doesn't care about me anymore.  Does that make you feel...  He told me I changed.  How did you change?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He always said when you put a ring on it.  Oh.  Oh, so he's a little jealous about that.  I guess it's different.  Yeah.  To him.  I don't know.  Well, Sal.  Yes, Sam.  I hear you're going to be board-ropping for Ron and Fez today.  Yeah, I'm pulling like a quadruple shift today.  Quadruple?  Yeah.  It's not a quadruple shift.  You'll be out of here in eight hours. 
[03:52:30]  It's a single shift.  No, I'm going to be...  I mean, I got to do the replay, so I'm going to be out of here like around four or five.  Yeah, I thought Troy was doing the replay.  The Ron and Fez replay?  Oh, you have to do the Ron and Fez replay?  Yeah, I'm going to be here like 12 hours today.  How come you have to do the Ron and Fez replay?  Do they not have any guys coming in?  I...  The Chris isn't coming in.  Pip isn't coming in.  Man.  Who told you you have to do it?  Rob?  Rob asked, and I said yes, I would...  You should have been like, no, Rob.  Why don't you get your own ass in here?  That's what I would have done.  No.  Show a little balls.  You know? 
[03:53:00]  Sally balls.  I'm trying to make up for yesterday a little bit, you know?  I get...  Yeah, that's true.  I'm putting in 12 hours today.  I put in zero yesterday.  And I stayed at a hotel.  I gave an hour-long phone call.  It was a beating, you know?  It wasn't...  That's true.  Yeah, but you know what?  I give credit to the guys that gave you the beating.  Not you for just sitting there taking it.  You're right.  Who was that that gave the beating?  Well, that was...  That was Opie.  Oh.  That was Anthony.  It was Jim Norton.  Yeah.  A little spice from Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I peppered in a few blows there, didn't I? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, every once in a while.  Like, every three minutes, I'd say.  Sal, I'm an artist in here, okay?  I gotta keep these things going.  And you know what I do?  I don't allow bullshit to fly around here.  I don't like it when there's a lot of bullshit flying around.  And I want to make it so that everything is on the table.  And it all came out.  It did, didn't it?  It all came out.  Except for you.  We're just waiting for you to come out, finally.  It'll happen.  I know it will.  And that'll be a beautiful day on the Opie and Anthony show.  But, until you're ready, there's nothing to...  I guess that's why they must have been turning off all the power and everything. 
[03:54:00]  I mean, I can't imagine how terribly dangerous the electric current in a subway would be.  I mean, there are feet of water.  They said salt water hitting the electricity.  I'm sure someone is a better, you know, more of an expert about it.  But salt water hitting electricity is particularly bad.  Opie has a great question that he wants to chime in.  How many packs of skinny jeans did Sal pack for his big shift day?  He does look really good.  But he's dressing really well for this.  Who, Sal?  Sal.  You think he's good? 
[03:54:30]  He always looks good.  Thank you, Jess.  Listen.  I like his watch.  Of course you like his watch.  Sal, let's just put it this way.  Sal knows how...  Where did you learn how to accessorize, Sal?  I don't know.  Just over time.  Some of the gentlemen you hung out with?  Yes.  Yeah, well.  How many skinny jeans did you pack for all your shifts today?  These aren't even skinny.  These are pretty baggy.  These are my boots jeans.  Are they baggy, Jess?  They're his jeans that he wears with his boots.  Do you even know what jeans to pair with what shoes?  The ones that I wore yesterday.  Yes. 
[03:55:00]  Yes.  These are what jeans.  If I'm wearing boots, I'll wear the jeans I wore yesterday.  However, if I'm wearing sneakers, I'll wear the jeans that I wore yesterday.  Do you wear jeans two days in a row, Sal?  Yeah, sometimes.  Do you ever get jealous?  Do you get jealous?  Who does your laundry?  Do you have laundry in your building?  No, I drop it off and they do it for me.  Oh, good for you, Sal.  I'm glad.  I'm sure that most people, you know, when they first get out of college, are just dropping  their laundry off.  They're having it done for them.  It's not that much more money.  No, no.  It's worth the extra expense, isn't it?  Yeah. 
[03:55:30]  A little time for yourself.  Time has a value, doesn't it?  Absolutely.  But that must mean you have a double just while you're waiting for your other clothes.  What do you mean by a double?  Like, if you like a pair of jeans, do you buy two?  Sometimes.  Oh, my God.  Are you fucking...  What?  What?  Sam, you gotta understand.  That's smart purchasing.  How much money do your jeans cost?  The ones I'm wearing right now, they're pretty expensive.  How much?  They're seven for all mankind.  Oh, yeah.  How much do those jeans cost?  I don't know.  They're for all mankind.  They cover between $150 and $2, maybe? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, around that.  They're probably more.  Because Sal said that embarrassingly.  Yeah, around that.  Because they're probably like...  Sal doesn't go to the discount shops.  Okay?  Sal gets it when it's on season.  It's important.  When you look good, you feel good.  And when you feel good, you do a good job.  There's no fucking way that after the beating Sal took, he could wear anything that would make  himself feel good.  That's a good point.  After yesterday...  After yesterday, he would.  He'd have to wear a gold LeMay body suit to even start to have any rationalization.  I don't care what kind of blue jeans you have. 
[03:56:30]  Diamond socks.  They could be seven for all mankind as well as extraterrestrials, and they still wouldn't  make you feel better.  Yeah.  How much did your jeans cost?  I think, yeah.  I think they're around like 200 bucks.  We'll say $200.  Yeah.  And you bought two?  Of these, I only have two pairs of seven for all mankind.  That's smart.  That's it?  If you know a pair of jeans fits you well, you buy two.  If I know a pair of jeans fits me well, I just wear them all the time.  Yeah.  You don't need two pairs of jeans.  And then you go, oh, I put a pen in my pants. 
[03:57:00]  And then I get ink on them.  He has identical ink stains.  I did.  I did.  I have one pair of jeans that fits me well, and I had a pen, and I was rotating it between  pockets, and now there's ink stains on both pockets.  But ink stains do not change the way your pants fit.  Which is why you still wear them.  Right.  The pants don't fit just as well.  Sal, if you've got an ink stain on your pants, still wear them?  Oh, fuck no.  Salvo for those, huh?  I'll try to get the stain taken out, but I will definitely not wear them anymore if  they're ripped or anything.  I want to get some of Sal's hand-me-downs. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, you and me both.  Are you kidding me?  My God, Sal.  Now, do you buy your own clothes, or is that mommy?  No, I buy my own clothes.  Yeah?  My mom doesn't buy my own clothes.  All right.  What is that, a crazy thing?  You must have a huge clothing budget.  I don't.  Really?  I'm the type of person, I'd rather spend more money on a quality item as opposed to  buying ten shitty things.  And then you just have less.  But how'd you get so many quality items?  Just over the years.  I bet you did.  Yeah, over the years, but you managed to maintain staying on season, don't you?  Do you pay attention to what's going on per season? 
[03:58:00]  I read GQ, absolutely.  Oh, my God.  But it's also easier for guys.  What do you mean?  Did you just say, what's that?  Oh, this is 86th Street.  That's a subway station on 86th Street.  They say the bridges on the east side are open.  Oh!  But how do you get that?  Good question.  Troy, do you think Sal is more fashionable than you?  No.  No.  You don't.  And Sal, do you think you're more fashionable than Troy?  Uh, no.  I think Sal's catalog fashionable. 
[03:58:30]  Okay.  And Troy's like the underground hip fashionable.  Like, Troy, would you say that's accurate?  Yeah, I mean, Sal dresses very well.  You know what I mean?  You've noticed that.  Well, of course.  I mean, I'm surrounded by slobs.  Who's a slob?  I mean, most people that work in this building are slobs.  I'm not a slob.  I'm not a slob.  You're not slobby.  You guys are both pretty slobby.  I'm not slob.  I'm not a slob.  I mean, you're not, like we discussed before, you're not real fashion forward.  You're clean.  This is a jeans shirt.  Yeah, you're clean.  Roland's a slob. 
[03:59:00]  This is a jeans shirt, you bitch.  But the only thing about Roland is he is clean.  He just doesn't dress real nice.  He's wearing paints today.  He looks like a slob, though.  He dresses slobby, sure.  Yeah, he washes himself.  But he dresses like a slobby.  And he smells clean.  That's really important.  But it's also important to buy your clothes from Models and other places, not just Models.  Well, you gotta go to Moe's.  I just don't think that's even an issue with Roland.  No.  You know what I mean?  Like, I don't even think that's even in his vocabulary whatsoever to even try to dress.  If you get a J.Crew catalog and shake it, Sal's will fall out of the catalog. 
[03:59:30]  So Sal just goes by whatever the pictures look like in the magazine.  Yeah, he'll be like, ooh, that guy J.Crew looks good.  I'm gonna wear what he wears.  Is that right, Sal?  You just go by pictures?  Like, you just go in and you'll get your little 17 magazine and you'll say, make me look like this?  No, I will do research on clothing, of course, and I go buy it.  What type of research do you do on clothing?  I don't understand.  Like, if I read GQ and I see something that I like in it, I'll go to that store and I'll get it.  Or Tiger Beat?  Yeah, he Facebooks all his friends.  Hey, J.Crew fellas, what are we all wearing tomorrow?  You shop at J.Crew a lot, I guess? 
[04:00:00]  Look at him.  No, I've never bought anything from J.Crew.  Sal, have you ever heard of a company called Bonobos?  No.  Okay.  They're good?  It's a good test.  What about you, Troy?  You know Bonobos?  No.  I don't know that either.  Is that a sushi place?  No, it's a test to see how fashion...  Oh, so Sal and Troy are not nearly as fashion forward as they think they are.  I'm a test Sal.  That's what you're saying?  Sal, do you ever have shopped at Models?  Models, never.  That's probably a good thing.  Um, yeah, well, Sal, do you look at Troy as like a sort of fashion guru? 
[04:00:30]  Guru?  Guru.  I don't know about that, but I know Troy's definitely on top of like, you know, getting  some fresh threads.  The appreciation that you guys have for each other's wardrobe is just kind of jarring to  me.  Well, we're few and far between in this place.  I guess, but I just don't care what guys...  I mean, to a point, I don't care where you're...  Roland, I will notice, he dresses like a slob every day, and I'll tell him, you gotta  clean yourself up a little bit.  The only thing, I don't mind Roland's clothing, I just don't like when Roland has like holes 
[04:01:00]  in his shirt.  He wears Jets workout shorts to work.  Yeah, but they let me, so I push it.  Well, yeah, of course they let you.  It's not a dictatorship around here.  You're an adult.  They just expect that an adult wouldn't come to work wearing Jets workout shorts and shirts,  as Sal says, with holes in the armpits.  Well, no, because I came with shorts, I go, sure.  So I took that and ran with it.  That doesn't even make any sense.  It does.  You took what and ran with it?  The fact that they gave you permission to wear shorts? 
[04:01:30]  During the wintertime, they're like, when are you going to wear pants?  I go, I don't know.  But why not just wear some pants?  It's not my job.  My job is just bringing guests.  I don't give a shit what I wear.  Okay.  I mean, I just...  I mean, you gotta respect that.  Yeah.  I just feel like you'd be more comfortable if you realized...  Like, you could just wear normal clothes.  Like, I feel like the clothes that I wear are decent clothes, but they don't stand out  at all.  Yeah, but...  And that's the way I want it.  But, like, I get invited by publicists and that.  They go, yeah, come on, you're different, you're funny.  So that's what I wear. 
[04:02:00]  That's what they expect.  Shirts with holes in them?  Yeah.  Isn't there, like, some spot where you could stop?  Like, you could be like...  No.  No.  No.  They like that you dress like a slob.  Yeah.  Don't you think they're looking down on you a little bit?  No.  Aren't they making fun of you a little bit?  Because one of the biggest publicists, he dresses worse than I do.  He does.  And he controls, like, half of Hollywood.  But does he go out and do...  Yes.  Or is he in his...  He does.  He does go out that way.  He can't pan the holes.  It is funny what he does.  Roland's really good at what he does.  He is.  So it's like, when you are really good at what you do, it's kind of like, it's funny  that you just don't give a fuck about your appearance. 
[04:02:30]  Don't you ever, Troy, or Sal, too, don't you ever just not want to give a fuck?  Yeah, but it's also like what Jess was saying earlier.  I mean, when you have on a nice outfit, you go out looking good, people look at you, they  notice what you're wearing.  It feels good.  It makes you feel good.  It makes you stand up a little bit taller.  You know, it makes you feel like, you know?  For a minute, I was, like, trying to figure out what...  You know what I mean?  Like, paying attention to stuff.  But I got exhausted so quickly by it that I was like, fuck. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, but it's just some people...  Yeah, Modell's.  Gotta go to Moe's.  This is awful.  Some people are just...  It's just...  They enjoy...  They know what looks good, and they know how to do it.  Like, if you have to really go out and force yourself to try...  Well, like...  Yeah, I guess it would be exhausting.  When Sal said research, I was...  Out.  Tap out.  Like, I would never want to have to research my clothes.  I don't think it's like, well, I have to go online and do a report on what's going on  this season.  I think it's just like...  Sal, have you ever done a book report on shirts? 
[04:03:30]  No.  What I was saying was just, you look at GQ and you see, like, a cool article or something  like that, or a cool tie.  Oh, you just see people walking down the street and you're like, oh, look at those Nikes.  Those are hot.  I need to go find those.  I'll buy shoes.  You know?  Yeah.  Or you say, oh, that's a hot jacket.  You go to, like, uh...  You go to G-Star and you're like, oh, look at this.  Look at these jackets this season.  This is cool.  I need to pick one of these up.  I gotta tell you something.  Jess would surprise you with how fashion-forward she...  Because you're talking about G-Star now.  I knew about G-Star, like, four years ago.  Well, yeah.  So did I.  That's when Jess was like... 
[04:04:00]  Well, Jess is very fashion.  I don't, you know...  I don't know why Jess would be with somebody so slobby as yourself.  I'm not slobby.  We established it.  You know why Jess is with somebody like me?  Because I'm a charming motherfucker.  You're very charming.  You're very charming.  You're an awesome dude.  But just think of how much more excited Jess would be to go out with you if you were like,  bam!  Like a nice, nice, tight outfit.  People who dress well generally are, like, they get tiring.  No.  Yeah.  Like, I find people who, like, dress really... 
[04:04:30]  Like, Sal?  You heard him on the air today.  He's a boring guy.  You're not a boring guy.  I'm not saying that.  But Sal is a boring guy.  And you?  You're exhausting.  You're exhausting.  Like, Jess, if I was like you, Jess would be like, all right already.  And if I was like Sal, Jess would be like, exactly.  You see what a boring guy Sal is.  Could I take Sal out to go see the, um, by the Hudson?  Yeah.  See some storm chasing?  I was screaming.  I was pumped.  Right.  And he was quiet.  He was quiet because he's a boring guy. 
[04:05:00]  And you're exhausting for it.  I'm like, storm chasing.  That's fine.  I'll accept that.  You're okay with it.  You understand.  You're exhausting.  But sometimes I'm exhausting.  Sometimes I'm just chill.  I don't have to see those times.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Listen, we got to make room for Ron and Fez.  Sal, why don't you stay where you are?  I will.  Okay.  You stay where you are.  I'll be here for about four hours.  Don't worry.  Roland, Troy, me, Jess, Troy's lovely lady.  Why don't we hit the bricks?  Is that okay with everybody?  Yeah.  Okay.  Sal, you stay put.  Get the fuck out of here.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.
