<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in self-deprecating and vulgar humor, describing themselves with various derogatory terms. They discussed negative listener feedback from Mike Smith in San Francisco, contrasting it with positive feedback from Jessica in California.  The show's website redesign was mentioned, along with their "Whip Him Out Wednesday" (WOW) campaign and its surprising appearance in a new 9/11 movie. This led to a debate about the appropriateness of watching 9/11 movies versus disaster films like *Poseidon*, and a reminiscence about Richard Dreyfuss's appearance on the show to promote the film, as well as a story about Kurt Russell's movie theater experience.

Rich Voss, a stand-up comedian, was in the studio.  They discussed his recent successful Worcester show (6,000 attendees) and upcoming PNC Arts Center gig, sharing numerous vulgar anecdotes from his stand-up routine and their shared experiences playing golf, including injuries and humorous mishaps.  The hosts also covered Keith Olbermann's Nazi salute while mocking Bill O'Reilly and the subsequent letter from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), debating the context of Olbermann's actions, freedom of speech, and potential offense.  A bit of Voss's street comedy from a New York diner was played, followed by a news item about a radio DJ in West Palm Beach arrested for online communication with a minor.

The show then focused on the arrest of Bruno Moore, a 34-year-old English teacher, for sending explicit messages to a girl he believed to be 13 (an undercover officer).  The hosts discussed the ease of committing such crimes online in the early internet days versus today's increased policing.  They analyzed Moore's MySpace profile, noting underage girls in his "Top 8," with Jim Norton sharing a screengrab and commenting on their appearance.  The discussion extended to underage girls sending friend requests and suggestive photos to the hosts themselves via MySpace, including Norton's anecdote about a 14-year-old girl whose father was a fan.

A listener complaint about the show replacing "Shred and Reagan" in Buffalo and the resulting "fixtheedge.com" website was addressed. The hosts mocked a letter from a "Bored Morning Commuter," vowed to expose the website creator's identity, challenged "Shred and Reagan" to call in, and revealed their "pests" were investigating the website.  They argued that listener preference is about humor, not station ownership.  Audio clips from the 1950s educational film "Molly Grows Up" about menstruation were played with humorous commentary, and there was brief discussion of Heather Mills's divorce from Paul McCartney.  Tom Morello from Audioslave was mentioned as a later guest.


The show continued with a discussion about tampon commercials on Cartoon Network, followed by a conversation with female caller Renee about menstruation.  This led to crude jokes about menstruation and other topics, including more jokes from another caller.  The hosts promoted their comedy show and discussed reality TV shows like *Flavor of Love*, *Hell's Kitchen*, and *Girls Next Door*, with graphic descriptions of their content.  They discussed the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction process, including Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, and Ron Bennington's opinions.

Tom Morello was interviewed, covering Audioslave's new CD, *Revelations*, past collaborations (including encounters with Jimmy Page and Joe Strummer), a Cuba concert, his political views, and the band's trip to Cuba.  The conversation also touched on political ideologies, reality TV, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  A street segment followed, featuring interactions with various people, including a homeless man and a tourist family, punctuated by crude jokes and humorous observations.  The planned performance by "Fan," the piano player, was cancelled due to technical difficulties.


A segment featured a guest, Dan, playing a low-quality keyboard, with jokes about the keyboard and his performance, including references to "pussy" and "dirty cunts."  Dan attempted to play pieces like the Maple Leaf Rag.  The conversation shifted to Floyd Landis's appearance on Jay Leno and his drug test excuses.  The hosts reviewed Gene Simmons' reality show, "Family Jewels," criticizing the acting and storylines.  Extensive discussion and audio clips from *Flavor of Love* were played, focusing on a contestant defecating and a physical altercation.  A caller described a "wow" moment (a woman exposing her breasts), and there was a call from a New York Post writer and other listener calls, including one from a listener who fired a gun into his apartment wall.  Audio from "Boo Got Shot," a humorous call about a shooting incident, was also played.

A phone call with an intoxicated Mike, handling firearms on air, took place.  Mike discussed his Paltalk ban for shooting a hole in his wall, and the hosts urged him to unload his weapons, guiding him through the process multiple times.  Mike displayed multiple firearms, including pointing a .45 caliber handgun at the camera, and expressed a desire to shoot another hole in his wall, which the hosts dissuaded.  The segment ended with Mike calming down and unloading his weapons.  The discussion then moved to an Esquire magazine article about a woman with two vaginas, featuring sexually explicit and humorous discussion and listener calls. The segment concluded with discussion about conjoined twins who underwent separation surgery.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes. 
[00:00:30]  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Fud, fud, fud.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk-nick friend. 
[00:01:30]  You can act like a man.  Well, come on, let's go.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 horse.  You're just a tool.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog. 
[00:02:00]  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  Good morning.  Hey, czar.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus, you should only get the virus. 
[00:02:30]  Mike Smith from San Francisco doesn't like us.  What did we do?  It's so weird because we have this instant feedback.  So I come in here and I kind of read some of the instant feedback that comes in overnight.  Yeah.  Well, there's not a lot of it comes in.  You know, they'll listen to a replay or something.  They'll comment on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And right around all that Mondo topless stuff where people are saying, oh, my God, that's  hilarious, blah, blah, blah.  You guys are really funny. 
[00:03:00]  It's good to have you back.  All this crap, right?  Uh-huh.  There's Mike Smith.  All right, Mike.  And I got to tell you, he's the only one out of, I don't know, like a dozen or so  instant feedbacks that I quickly read as I sat down here this morning.  He's from San Francisco.  He writes, hey, guys, been listening to you since you've come on air.  Maybe New York audiences are used to your less than interesting, self-serving humor.  But it's not really cutting it here in California, man. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, Mike Smith is now representing everyone in the state of California.  Right, right, right.  When you have to promote yourself so much, it loses any credibility.  What?  We barely promote ourselves.  Promote ourselves.  Perhaps the station is running promos.  That's nice.  Oh, okay.  Maybe they're motivated out there in San Francisco and they're promoting the show.  That would definitely be nice.  Because listen, Mike Smith, you idiot.  Don't talk for everyone.  Yeah, first of all, you're not representing everybody in California. 
[00:04:00]  Secondly, I guess you don't understand radio.  See, when you're introduced to a brand new market, you promote the show.  It might seem like a lot to you, somebody who probably listens a lot.  If you listen a lot, then you're going to hear a lot of promos for the show.  Right.  You're one of those people, Mike, please, call back or write back when you're a ridiculous, huge fan of the show.  Well, he has every right to have his opinion, but to say that it's not cutting it here in California like he's taking some huge survey all over the state. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  How would he even know how to send instant feedback?  I'm on the show and I don't know how to do that.  Because if it's something you didn't like, wouldn't you just research it, find out how to get in touch with these people immediately, comment on it, comment on it in a way where obviously you're listening because you're hearing a lot of promos.  So you're not just punching in once, deciding we suck.  It's the same thing.  Well, we got Jessica from California. 
[00:05:00]  Mike is a douche.  California loves the O&A.  Wow.  See, now I accept what Jessica is saying.  All of California loves us.  But I'm glad that you guys, you guys are like comics, like a thousand people could say you're great and one person goes, ah, the show stunk.  And you're like trying to please that one person.  You're like, what the show stunk?  That's right.  One person comes up to a comic and has anything negative to say, that's what you're going to dwell on.  That's what we do.  You know, you just get crazy over it. 
[00:05:30]  Low self-esteem.  Thank you, Rich Voss.  You get us all wanting attention.  A couple other things.  A brand new look for opiananthony.com.  You might want to check that out today.  I guess Steve stayed up, he stayed up all night long and he's got a new look for our website.  It looks really, really cool.  He's got to tweak it a little bit, but in general, that's what it's going to look like.  And it's very impressive.  I like it.  Yes.  Does he use more than half the screen this time?  It's, yeah.  It was all black surrounding this little teeny window that the foundry would use.  I know.  What's the matter with them? 
[00:06:00]  No, look at it.  It looks pretty good.  He's got to tweak it a bit, but not bad.  Not bad at all.  I look homely in that picture.  It's a picture of you as Frank the Frowner.  I don't look attractive.  I want to pick where I'm handsome.  So check that out today.  And of course, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  And now we're in Tucson, Arizona.  So now we've got to explain WOW to Tucson, Arizona.  Tucson.  This old gag.  But this old gag works so well that one of our WOW stickers is in that new 9-11 movie. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  World Trade Center, right?  Yep.  That opens today, I believe.  I guess they must have sat back and thought, hey, what was really big back when that happened?  And then our show came up and the WOW concept stickers all over the place on cars.  So they figured, yeah, I'll throw one in one of the lockers, in the locker scene.  And it's apparently for like 30 seconds when some cops are talking.  Yeah, the cops are talking and they focus in on this WOW sticker. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, WOW sticker.  It's our names on everything.  It's huge publicity for the radio show.  And a horrific movie.  And a horrific movie, which is a little strange because we're kind of excited.  But it's also obviously a very serious movie.  I don't know.  I hate reading.  I hate reading like people that go, oh, I'm not going to see this movie.  But I'm not going to see this movie.  Like I can't.  I just, I really can't.  And don't write or call saying, we got to keep it in the minds of everybody and stuff. 
[00:07:30]  Believe me.  I read on a daily basis.  I look at a lot of stuff.  I know exactly what's going on and I didn't forget.  I'm affected by it on a daily basis.  I think you're like my dad.  But I can't really sit there and watch it as entertainment or something.  I'll watch shows on Discovery, History Channel, things like that on the technical side of it.  Yeah.  How the buildings came down.  You know, you watch how the planning went with Al-Qaeda. 
[00:08:00]  And how they figured it out and everything.  That's fine.  But I don't know if I could watch an entertainment movie.  I think it affects.  I was saying, I think you're like my dad.  When you go to the movies, you want to be entertained.  You don't want to like feel like sad.  When they showed this movie to like the victims, family members and people that were there, emergency service workers, cops, they described like, and as the movie ended, a solemn crowd left the theater silently. 
[00:08:30]  It's like, I don't want to leave like that.  I want to leave like that scene where Leslie Nielsen's leaving the movie Platoon in that naked gun move.  Remember how funny that was?  Yeah.  They're playing that Herman's Hermits like love song.  And Leslie Nielsen is walking out with Priscilla Presley and their arms around each other.  And they're laughing hysterically.  You think they're leaving a movie theater?  They're coming out of a comedy or something.  And they pan up and you see the Marquis says Platoon.  And they're just cracking up.  What a great scene.  But that's what I wanted to do. 
[00:09:00]  I want to leave a movie laughing or talking about the movie or something.  I don't want to leave like, oh my God, that was horrible.  That's how passionate the Christ was.  People needed to be escorted out of the movie theater.  They were so sad and crying and blubbering all over themselves.  Jews, right?  Well, when I saw Schindler's List, I tried to get some laughter going in.  Oh, that's impossible.  You're just staring.  What's wrong with him?  I'm pothin' you.  I saw United 93.  I watched it on a pay-per-view.  And it was a great movie, man.  I can't believe how much I liked it as far as it wasn't sensationalized. 
[00:09:30]  It was really well acted.  That's what I hear.  I might see that.  Well, I would do the same thing just to hear the story of these two guys.  It's pretty amazing the way they survived it.  If it was some stupid movie about a hero.  Like an Irwin Allen disaster movie where we have to meet the people.  The first half of the movie is getting to know who everyone is that's going to be involved in the disaster.  And then who dies, who lives.  Right, right.  I just watched Poseidon. 
[00:10:00]  I know that movie's been out for a while, but I catch everything from hotels.  The new version?  Yeah.  Wasn't it cool?  I catch everything in the hotels.  The reviews were awful for Poseidon.  I thought it was great.  I did too, man.  High body count, horrific deaths.  Yeah, they didn't screw around.  It was really cool.  I guess that's why it did badly.  Because it was a little too horrific.  Well, the dialogue was pretty basic.  Yeah.  The movie was...  I think the movie was like an hour and eight minutes.  It was a really short movie.  But that's good too.  Get in, get out. 
[00:10:30]  Roll the boat over.  Kill a few people off.  A few people are saved.  That's one of those movies, the latest Poseidon.  It was this close to being really good.  Yeah.  They needed to make it a little longer and they needed a little better dialogue.  But the action scenes were awesome.  Yeah, really good.  Kurt Russell drowning.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you just ruined it for people.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Well, they rushed out to see it when it was in the theaters.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Screw them.  Absolutely screw them.  The movie made like $3 million or something crazy like that.  No one cared about this movie. 
[00:11:00]  They didn't care about the movie to the point Richard Dreyfuss had to come on our show to  promote it.  Yeah, he never would have come on our show.  Do you think Richard Dreyfuss, if he was in a hit movie, he would have been on our show  promoting?  Mm-hmm.  No, he was trying to save that movie.  I don't know.  He played a little queen in that, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  Surprising.  And I told you the story.  I think we did it over at XM when I saw Poseidon.  And I went to the preview on the iMac or iMacs or whatever the hell it's called.  IMac.  Yeah.  And just before the movie was starting, Kurt Russell's finding a seat. 
[00:11:30]  And he's trying to sit down.  And the lady's like, that seat is saved.  And I'm looking at this lady.  It was a black lady.  I'm like, he's one of the stars of the movie.  The goddamn movie.  Let him sit.  That's whatever he wants.  And he's all polite.  He's a snake, you idiot.  Right.  And he's all polite.  Like, oh, all right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And then, you know, sits further down in a much worse seat.  And I'm thinking, God, even Kurt Russell can't get a break in the movie theater. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, her out.  Have her removed.  And then it was weird watching him drown on the screen.  Watching him watch himself drown on the screen is what I should say.  That was really bizarre to me.  Very surreal.  Yeah, that was a pretty horrific scene.  You know, watching him drown.  Right.  It's like, wow, that looked like it could have been a pretty accurate depiction of somebody  drowning.  That's how it is when you drown.  Hollywood didn't, like, sugarcoat that this time around.  His best movie is Used Cars.  Oh.  I love that movie, Used Cars.  Used Cars is a good movie. 
[00:12:30]  It's a good one.  All right.  It's funny.  It's the 70s.  So let's bring it back around.  Whip Him Out Wednesday for Tucson, Arizona.  Is that where we were?  Well, yeah.  The WOW sticker's in the World Trade Center movie.  Yeah.  And that's pretty cool.  We're going to have to get that clip and get it up on our website.  But basically, it stands for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Wow.  And now it's Whip Him Out Whenever.  Whip Him Out Whenever.  We got bumper stickers.  I don't know how the radio stations are distributing the bumper stickers.  I really don't know.  We need to know that because there's a lot of people in a lot of these cities that really want to get involved with the WOW thing, the WOW phenomenon. 
[00:13:00]  So I'm hoping the website or the radio station you're listening to us on maybe has a way you can get your WOW stickers.  If not, the homemade WOW sticker, the homemade WOW signs work just as well.  And there are women out there.  They will flash you on the way to work and on the way home from work, on the way to sporting events and concerts, and on the way to the lake or the shore or the ocean, whatever.  Yes.  And it's worked beautifully for many, many years, and it continues to work. 
[00:13:30]  So make sure you get a WOW on your car.  And just throw the WOW on your car and just kind of go about your business and see what happens.  It's kind of like fishing.  Yeah.  There's plenty of women out there that will do it.  And all we ask, and it's worked great for us, just don't harass the ladies.  That's all.  There's plenty of women out there more than willing to do this.  Matter of fact, if you're a woman and you're WOWing today, give us a call so we can see what's going on out there, okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And that's how we begin today.  Rich Voss in studio. 
[00:14:00]  What's going on?  What do you think of the O&A traveling virus?  I had so much fun.  You know what?  When you can get 6,000 people to just laugh and sit through a show, they were like the greatest crowd up there in Worcester.  It was unbelievable.  Worcester.  Worcester.  That they were just, you know what I mean?  To get 6,000 people and get through the sets and everybody killed it.  It was just a great show.  It was a lot of fun.  I don't like sincere, Voss.  Well, what am I going to do?  It was fun.  I had a good time.  Even though Anthony, like during the show, you know, when they had that little glitch with the video screen. 
[00:14:30]  And I'd run back out in the dark and, you know, try to keep it going.  And after that, Anthony's like, man, great.  Great in a pinch, man.  Thank you.  That was really cool.  Then I listened to the show Monday.  And Voss, he stinks, slobbering on the audience, all nervous.  We were practicing your lines backstage for like 10 or 15 minutes.  No.  And you were in a slight.  Come on, man.  You were in a panic.  Here's the thing.  Me, you, and Pete, we're huddling.  And you're like, all right, so I, what? 
[00:15:00]  So the video, is it a tape?  No, it's not tape.  It's tape, but we're making believe it's live.  So how do I?  I was not nervous.  We went over and over and over again.  And then when you went out there, you pulled it off.  Absolutely.  But to say you weren't nervous and freaking out is crazy.  I think maybe you were freaking out.  I was freaked out to be there.  Absolutely.  No, but I wasn't nervous because I can, I can take direction.  That's, you know, when I, when I play Lenny Bruce. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Someone apparently said, look, here's what you do.  Just act nothing like him.  And you took the direction.  Well, whatever.  All I know is I had so much fun up there.  I had a great time walking down in the beginning with all the people from upstairs and stuff.  Yeah, the reviews were great on all the websites and the reviews in the paper.  Generally very, very positive as well.  So we look forward to going to the PNC Arts Center on, uh, Center on August 26th.  Tickets are just, uh, selling like crazy at this point. 
[00:16:00]  Are they really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's going to be twice the audience that we had in Worcester.  Guaranteed.  Maybe even more.  And, and Jersey crowds are great.  I mean, you know, it's going to be New York, Jersey.  It's going to be so much fun.  I'm telling you, outdoors like that.  It's going to be.  Why are you looking at me?  Because I'm excited about this stuff.  I'm really excited.  Huh?  I'm thinking it's this.  I'm very excited to do this gig.  It's the same stage.  Sabbath has worked.  I'm very excited.  Oh.  I'm on that stage.  There you go.  Wow.  It's one of my dreams was to work the Arts Center as, as a kid.  You know, growing up, my first dream was like Rascals and then the Arts Center. 
[00:16:30]  It's just, you know, you have dreams, don't you?  Yes.  What is wrong with you today?  Nothing.  I'm trying to get into a group.  I'm going to put you in the penalty box in a minute.  You're trying to be gentle and sweet and be in your nature.  First of all, you're.  If it came true, you'd be dead in your seat right now.  First of all, you're very soft-spoken today.  Exactly.  We're adjusting your mic the whole time you've been on.  All right.  The fan is like shoving the mic in your face, trying to get some energy out of you.  NPR boss.  He's got an NPR delivery and he's a serious boss and happy to be here. 
[00:17:00]  We're all going to have fun.  Who cares?  One of my personal dreams, let me tell you that.  And if you have any calls about dreams, make sure you.  We're talking to a lot of people now.  No one cares.  Just be happy.  That's the important thing.  Just pump the show real fast.  Say you had a great time and then we can move on to some hilarity.  Worcester was cool, man.  I can't wait to do.  Worcester.  Worcester was cool.  I can't wait to do PNC.  Fun with a capital F.  What's that?  We're all going to have big fun, but be safe, folks.  That's right. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Well, listen, don't drink and dry.  You know, I've goofed on a lot of people here tonight, but I just want to know, you know, I love you all.  We're all created equal.  How about a handful, ladies and germs?  We should do this.  Let me just get the plug in.  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a venue near you.  The next stop is August 26th, PNC Bank Arts Center in Jersey.  All the info is up on OpieandAnthony.com.  The brand new OpieandAnthony.com, presented by Bud Light. 
[00:18:00]  Always worth it, okay?  Before we take a break, we've got to play your latest set from the street.  This is the boss we know and love.  Route 57.  Yeah, not the sincere, mellow, I'm on Valium, man, so I don't smoke cigarettes.  You're like an overnight FM jock from 1975.  What is wrong with you?  Start smoking again.  No, I just got, Jesus, you smashed me for smoking.  I quit smoking.  It has nothing to do. 
[00:18:30]  Of course.  Huh?  There's no way you shot an 81 yesterday.  I shot an 81.  I'm mad at you.  I guarantee I shot an 81.  There's no reason to lie about golf.  I mean, you know, I shot an 81.  No reason to lie about golf.  Yeah, no.  That's something important.  Yeah, because that's the sport no one lies at.  That's a good point.  But I shot an 81.  Winter rules, you know.  Don't count that.  Here's the thing.  I hate playing golf with people that cheat, and you know you're better than them, and you  know you're scoring better than them, and, you know, you get off the 18th hole, and 
[00:19:00]  they go, what did you shoot?  And I'm like, ah, 94, which is legit, putted everything out, you know, lost ball, taking  the penalties, and you play with, you know, these guys, and they take mulligans.  I got to take a hangover mulligan.  What's a hangover mulligan?  And then I was away when this particular time happened.  You know, I flew, and I got jet lag.  I'm going to take a jet lag mulligan.  Jet lag mulligan.  So it's mulligan for this, mulligan for that, a hot dog mulligan, because I just ate food 
[00:19:30]  after nine holes, and I'm a little full.  And so I shoot a legit 94, no mulligans, and I go, what did you shoot?  He goes, 88.  And then he looks at me like he's the superior golfer.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  And they moved the ball.  You took like four or five mulligans.  And they moved the ball in the rough, like they'll make a better line.  And then you're like, and then they're on the, this is only, you know, fun for people  that play golf, obviously.  But they're, you know, we're all on the green, and he's got like a 10-foot putt, but he's  in your line. 
[00:20:00]  So he's like, oh, let me just get this out of your way.  And doesn't even like line up the putt or anything, like hits it backhand, because it's,  it's, I'm just getting it out of the way, right?  And he counts the putt when he misses.  You know, you're only kidding yourself, folks.  That's all I'm trying to say.  You're lying to yourself.  You good golfer for us?  Yes.  I mean, I, I, I, yeah.  I like when people get a bad lie in the rough, and it's like, I just got to puff it up a  little bit.  I'm just puffing it up.  And they're pretty much teeing up the ball on a clump of grass that they've like fashioned 
[00:20:30]  into a tee.  Yeah.  So now you don't have to hit the grass.  What do you do if you hit on a sand trap?  Oh.  Can you get your club with the little S written on the bottom?  What can't you, like, what if you can't hit it out?  I've seen that happen.  I've been holding the club and had that happen, where you hit it, and it rolls right back  at your feet, and you feel like a silly, silly goose.  Or you could hit the club into the sand and, and have a hairline fracture in your wrist 
[00:21:00]  after you hit the club in the sand, if you hit it wrong.  That happened?  Oh.  Yeah, Scopey.  Graham cracker bones.  Listen.  He's the only guy that got a hairline fracture.  He fractures your hands in sand.  That is so from sand.  Hold on.  First of all, it was, F you, man.  It was the blue monster.  I know the sand's different than the blue monster.  Voss and I were lucky enough to play the Doral in Miami.  Yeah.  The blue monster, where they play one of the PGA tournaments. 
[00:21:30]  Not the PGA tournament, but one of their, one of their tournaments, whatever.  And they were getting prepared for the tournament of that year.  Yeah.  Okay?  They didn't have any sand in the sand traps.  You know that.  Well, it was a little hard.  I mean, after you sprained your, or broke your arm, I said, well, because then rugby  was out for the night.  We weren't going to play any rugby.  We knew that.  No, they took most of the sand out because they were, they were shipping in the really  nice sand for the pro golfers.  It was like hard.  So there was a little sand, there was a little sand, and then underneath that was the dirt  or what have you. 
[00:22:00]  The base.  It was, so I slammed down, and yeah, I broke my hand.  It was the worst.  Playing golf.  It was the worst.  That vacation was the worst.  He broke his hand.  I had to get a tooth pulled, right?  From a, like a dentist out of a van.  I didn't even know the dentist.  I'm somewhere in Miami.  You know, there's Cubans standing on line with cards trying to get their teeth pulled  or whatever.  I get my tooth pulled.  My whole face is swollen now.  I get an infection.  That's when we learned way too much about each other because like we're sharing a room  because it was his buddy down there, and they only had like one nice room left or whatever. 
[00:22:30]  So we're like, all right, we have our own beds, whatever.  And that's when I learned that.  I would hope so.  That's when I learned this guy's smoking habit was just off the hook because he would wake  up.  So we're like, all right, we have our own beds, whatever.  And that's when I learned this guy's smoking habit was just off the hook because he would  wake up in the middle of the night just to smoke.  So you had to lay in a room with him as he's smoking in the room?  Oh, yeah, with the awful noises he makes because his breathing's all effed up too.  Wow. 
[00:23:00]  And then that trip ended with him making out with the albino grandmother.  Right.  But I did break my hand in the sand trap.  But you broke my other hand with your stupid freaking lob wedge in Jersey.  Look at the bump.  I've been still there four years later playing golf.  And he has a tick on his leg.  And he's screaming.  He's screaming like a dick.  Anytime he says he's sick.  What an awful few rounds of golf you guys have played.  Honestly, I miss playing golf. 
[00:23:30]  I don't even know why we're talking about this.  We're going off on a tangent.  But I miss playing golf with Voss.  We used to have a lot of fun.  But he's a pain in the ass because, like we said earlier, most guys like cheating.  Voss doesn't cheat.  And that means spending a half hour to find a stupid golf ball instead of dropping after like 10 minutes.  So people are piling up behind you?  Yeah.  So we're in the middle of the fairway.  And where did I see a tick on my calf, I guess?  It was a very like, I mean, this course had a lot of tall grass and stuff. 
[00:24:00]  And I got a tick.  So I start jumping up and down.  And I do the tick dance.  And I pull up my shorts and give myself a huge wedgie.  And I'm jumping up and down in a circle, begging Voss to check the rest of me and make sure there's no more ticks on me.  And that was in the bedroom that night.  I had a check.  Didn't you get a bee sting too?  Didn't you get something like that?  And then so he wants to get that perfect score.  And he doesn't want a penalty.  So he goes to find his ball.  And I go on the green.  I'm on the green. 
[00:24:30]  And I'm waiting to putt.  And all of a sudden, like, he finds his ball.  And he grabs his lob wedge.  And all of a sudden, I see him hit it.  I've told this story before, but it's worth telling.  I see him hit the ball.  And I'm right behind the pin.  And I just see him watching the ball.  And I'm like, well, is it going to be on the green?  And then I'm thinking, well, if it's anywhere near me, he obviously would yell four, right?  Yeah.  Doesn't yell four.  Doesn't do anything.  My hand is out like this because I'm holding my putter with the palm of my hand like it's resting on top of it. 
[00:25:00]  That's what's out in front of you.  Slam right on the top of my hand.  Ow.  That has to hurt.  Golf ball coming from the heavens.  Oh, from the heavens because he used the lob wedge.  So he popped it.  Smack on the back of your hand.  He skied it.  So it instantly swells, like, to a point where the ranger's like, you got to go to the hospital.  It's bleeding.  The blood is seeping out of my skin.  And I got to look.  It's still there. 
[00:25:30]  I still putt.  It never healed.  I still putt it out.  So, dude, I'm in horrific pain.  I can't even tell you because I cracked this hand as well.  I've cracked both hands playing golf with Voss, right?  I'm in horrific pain and laughing at the same time because this dope wouldn't yell for.  And then he falls on the ground from where he hit it and he's laughing.  Can't count that high.  I had a girl once, a golf cart girl.  It was backed up 15 minutes a hole. 
[00:26:00]  I'm not lying.  And I was flirting with her.  I took a ride with her to the woods between holes.  And, well, let's say.  Really?  She did things with me.  And it was fun.  I finished, you know, with her.  And I get back to the hole and I'm yelling because I left my golf ball on her card after, you know, she took care of me.  The golf cart girl.  That's one of my favorite stories, man.  Well, as long as it's somebody's.  Huh?  All right, listen, we're really, really late. 
[00:26:30]  So it's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Get the WOW stickers on your trucks and your cars and your rides, whatever you have.  And hopefully you'll get lucky out there.  A lot of women out there that will flash you if they see the WOW stickers, okay?  I've seen people ask Voss, though, for autographs on the golf course.  They think he's Dorf from the videos.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony WOW stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that WOW stickers have many other uses? 
[00:27:00]  I sliced out both my kidneys and I patched up the wounds with WOW stickers.  But, but, dude, how do you pee?  Oh, boy.  Can't pee.  This was incredibly nearsighted.  Opie and Anthony!  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Pee-pee-dance.  Pee-pee-dance.  Gotta go pee.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  And I guess it has spread to Cape Cod.  Yes.  Hyannis. 
[00:27:30]  Right?  Welcome.  Hyannisport.  Maybe they should tell us this stuff ahead of time.  Nah.  Why?  The other day we were doing our radio show and all of a sudden we were getting a lot of  phone calls from Arizona.  And then later on in the day someone said, oh yeah, you're on in Tucson, Arizona today.  The Grand Canyon State.  I'm glad they didn't tell us.  We'd all be too nervous to go on.  We heard that you're on in Hyannis.  Who can concentrate on the rest of the country?  We're talking to like...  Jimmy, they are new listeners to the show. 
[00:28:00]  Welcome aboard.  Ugh.  That stupid accent you have.  We're talking to like 10,000 people now.  Something like that.  It's really growing.  It's nice.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  What's up with Keith Oberman?  You were saying something in the office there, Anthony.  Well...  He's using the Nazi salute on TV.  The Anti-Defamation League has sent Keith a little email.  A little letter.  On their little letterhead.  And they're a little annoyed. 
[00:28:30]  And him using the Sieg Heil Nazi salute.  Nice.  When he's referencing Bill O'Reilly.  Nice.  This started out at some...  One of these press things that they do.  And he was brought up to speak.  And he had a picture of Bill O'Reilly's face on a stick.  And he put it in front of his face and go on his Bill O'Reilly rhetoric.  Because these two have quite the rivalry going.  Well, Bill O'Reilly's just a babbling ass. 
[00:29:00]  And I'm glad someone's giving it to him on a nightly basis.  Yeah.  O'Reilly's a hypocrite.  He's just a jackass.  He really is just not a nice person.  He's an awful person.  A miserable person.  I agree with you both.  And I still...  I side with the ADL on this one.  You do?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we'll discuss.  We'll discuss.  And then he put the stick up with the picture of the face.  And did the Nazi raise the right hand.  Point your fingers forward. 
[00:29:30]  Keep it at about a 40 degree angle up on the...  I won't get into all the details.  A little too much info.  So he's been doing that.  Well, you can't see at home as his heels actually click under the desk as he did that.  It's the only way to do it with jackboots like this.  And when are you going to grow out that mustache again?  Well, I like a clip nice to close to each nostril.  We actually saw a dude in New York with the freaking mustache.  I'm like, are you nuts? 
[00:30:00]  He's trying to bring it back.  Are you nuts?  He's trying to bring it back.  Come on.  Everything old is new again.  So eventually...  That mustache will come back.  We've all seen the little curly waxed mustache.  That's from like the 1800s.  That made a little comeback for a while.  Fu Manchu's come back.  Everything comes back.  The little tiny...  Soul patch.  Maybe you do the Hitler with the soul patch and then maybe you can get away with it.  Slow down.  Right.  And then eventually you take the soul patch away and there you go.  Or maybe the Hitler with some big pork chop sideburns. 
[00:30:30]  I just feel bad for the guy out there that knows he looks really good with the Hitler mustache.  Does anyone look good in that mustache?  And he can't go with that look.  Little Charlie Chaplin brought so much joy to our country years ago.  He had the same mustache.  Does anyone think, hey, you're wearing a Charlie Chaplin mustache?  There is someone out there that knows they look much better with the Hitler mustache and they can't use it.  Hitler trumping on that mustache. 
[00:31:00]  We all look at our faces and go, all right, what's going to help this mess?  You've got a little goatee maybe.  Maybe I'll throw the sideburns a little long.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll do like, what do they call it, the chin strap.  But somebody out there you think would look better with the Hitler mustache.  Oh, they know.  And they can't use it.  They can't use it.  It's been verboten.  You did no more.  No more.  Can't wear it.  Or else you look like some kind of a white supremacist or a Nazi or just from some facial hair. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  So Keith Overman's doing the Nazi salute too.  Yeah, he's doing that.  And apparently he's using it more than just that one time.  He's using it whenever he references Bill O'Reilly, who he, you know, and a lot of other people kind of attach a fascist name tag to.  So he received a letter from the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League.  Dear Mr. Overman, we are deeply dismayed by your ongoing use of the Nazi Sig Heil salute, both on your program and in public appearances, 
[00:32:00]  including the recent Television Critic Association press tour while holding up a mask of Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly.  While we understand that your arm, your aim, arm, I thought because he raised it, is to entertain your audience by taking potshots at Mr. O'Reilly,  your repeated use of the Nazi salute has resulted in many complaints from our constituents, including Holocaust survivors and their families,  who find the use of the gesture offensive and repugnant in any context. 
[00:32:30]  The Nazi salute is more than just a remnant of history, but serves as a calling card for modern day neo-Nazis and white supremacists.  We believe that the use of gestures and imagery associated with the Nazis, even in jest, only serves to trivialize the Holocaust  and denigrate the memory of the six million Jews and others who died as a result of Hitler's final solution.  As a respected and well-known media personality, your actions have consequences and can set a standard for others to emulate. 
[00:33:00]  We are especially concerned that young people viewing your program might take their cues from you, your free use of the Sig Heil salute.  In light of these concerns, we hope that you will reconsider your use of the Nazi salute in the future.  Sincerely, Mel Gibson.  Now, of course, it's the Anti-Defamation League.  I just don't like the fact they reference kids.  Like, Keith Olbermann is, like, really popular with young kids.  With the kids.  No one cares about that. 
[00:33:30]  Keith's just trying to be popular with anybody on that channel.  Believe me, I think the guy's hysterical, but, you know, the ratings aren't exactly through the roof over there.  His show is great.  The format of the show is great.  I love it.  And I don't like O'Reilly.  I think O'Reilly is a jerk.  O'Reilly's a tool.  And I personally, I read transcripts of a sexual harassment thing, and I believed the woman.  Yeah.  I read what looked to me like transcripts, and I completely believed her.  Yeah.  And I always thought that he had something, he paid somebody to shut them out. 
[00:34:00]  He settled out.  As a filthy, dirty hypocrite.  I don't like him either.  To keep everybody quiet.  Yeah.  He settled out with some cash.  But, yeah.  I believe, taking both sides of the story, my opinion was that she had a point there.  I absolutely felt she was telling the truth.  Just part of the hypocrisy, that's O'Reilly.  And this Olbermann thing, the Nazi salute, yeah, it's pretty harsh.  It's a rough one.  It is a rough one.  But I've always been from the school of thought anything in the proper context as comedy, as dark comedy, is okay. 
[00:34:30]  Anyway, if Keith Olbermann was walking around doing this to try to incite people into the Nazi lifestyle, white supremacists trying to get them on board, that would be one thing.  The guy's goofing on Bill O'Reilly, who a lot of people call a fascist, with the ultimate fascist salute.  It does offend people, obviously.  Offends people greatly.  But you do have a freedom in this country to offend people. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, you do.  And, you know, this letter's fine.  It just voices their concern.  It doesn't threaten him.  But I think if he continues, then the threats of boycott and other things will come.  But I see it as something he's using to really call O'Reilly out and not incite white supremacists.  So what does he do at this point?  Does he continue doing it?  I don't know.  He's getting a lot of publicity today, but does he just stop on his own? 
[00:35:30]  Is it good publicity?  And guaranteed, O'Reilly is just going to eat this up.  Well, I think he's dishonest.  I think he's trying to marry himself to O'Reilly.  Kind of like that stupid alternative comic who was attacking Larry the Cable guy, that Hostetler guy or whatever.  Because you're marrying yourself to someone who's so much bigger.  Why do you do the Nazi thing unless you're looking for attention?  You kind of do that if your ratings suck and the other guy's ratings are beating you.  And you want to, like, kind of attach yourself to them because then eventually you pick up some of their ratings. 
[00:36:00]  That's kind of how it works.  No, I know.  So I think that's probably part of his motive.  Of course it's a motive.  You know, that's the bottom line.  He wants more viewers.  Is this getting him in the news?  Yeah, it is.  He's just trying to get under O'Reilly's skin.  And there's a general hatred there.  You know, they're competing for the same audience.  And good for Keith Olbermann, man.  Anything you do that's a little edgy, and I'm not saying this is just a little edgy, it's going to offend people.  Where are kids going to do this?  They say, there's two places you can do it. 
[00:36:30]  Getting a cab or in the classroom when you have to go to the bathroom.  It's not like kids are walking around, you know, going like, what do you do?  The cab thing you kind of do.  Yeah, you do it with a cab.  Putting your hand up in class a little more.  Yeah, you're going a little higher there.  Straight up.  But when you're hailing that cab.  Right.  Hey, Matt in Maine, what's up?  Hey, I think that's absolutely ridiculous they're giving him shit for that.  You can't curse on the radio, sweetie.  We're going to lose everything you just said.  Yeah, so start over without that.  I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they are on his case about that. 
[00:37:00]  Because I have not in any years seen anybody do the Nazi salute and actually mean it.  No, the only people that do, you see them in the films of white supremacists and there's like 10 jackasses standing around a campfire with some flags and they're doing it, listening to some hardcore skinhead music and just kind of doing the Sigh Heil.  And it looks ridiculous.  Exactly. 
[00:37:30]  If there was a symbol and there's no one moment or thing that symbolizes slavery, but say there was one or say there was something that mimicked the dragon guy, death of the black guy in Texas by the truck, pickup truck.  Do you think he would be continued doing that to mock someone who he thought was racially insensitive?  Like say O'Reilly said something anti-black and Oberman wanted to mock that.  Do you think he would be doing, every time he mentioned his name, some shuck and jive slavery reference?  Well.  I mean, eventually people call you out on it.  You got to stop.  I think if you're a white guy and there's a black guy that is really showing himself to be, I don't know, something. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know what it is.  Maybe, you know, abrasive.  Like, let's take Jesse Jackson with his Jaime Town reference years ago.  Of course you get away with it.  That you could bring up and you could take that to an extreme in the context of comedy and get away with it as a white guy.  Yeah, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about, like, us.  Reverend Al Sharpton is another one.  They're both black, though.  They can pretty much say whatever they want to and get away with it with political correctness.  But, no, but I'm saying Reverend Al, as a white guy, you can goof on Reverend Al in ways that might come off as racist and offensive to black people in general. 
[00:38:30]  But in the context of comedy, you get away with it.  You can get away with it because you have the right to do it.  But you would get so – I'm saying Oberman.  I'm saying as a talk show host or whatever it is he does on television every night, do you really think that that would continue happening?  He might do it once.  But, like, say some kind of an Uncle Tom reference or whatever or some kind of, like, a Sambo reference. 
[00:39:00]  Never.  It would never continue.  And this is – the Nazi thing is just so kind of universally known.  Like, people are like, ah, whatever.  It's just a stupid thing.  You ever see the whole problem with this?  That was the worst explanation I've ever given.  Anytime.  Don't think I don't know.  My whole – the wheels completely came off when I was talking.  But anytime a liberal –  Thank you for just shutting me up as I was trying to explain.  No, I know what you're saying, but go ahead.  Make your brilliant point.  I'm sorry.  Apologize.  Poignancy coming, folks.  Pull over.  Anytime a liberal – I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  It's okay.  It's all about you.  Go ahead.  You would know.  Anytime a liberal attacks a conservative, they call him a Nazi. 
[00:39:30]  They – you know, whenever they don't agree with anything a conservative says, he's a Nazi.  Bush is a Nazi for going into Iraq.  They compare him to Hitler.  All right?  They just downplay the Holocaust by saying every conservative is a Nazi.  It's not the fact that he raised his hand like that.  It's just that they're downplaying the Holocaust.  They do.  They do.  They did downplay – I'm not quite sure what the Holocaust is, but I'm sure it's kind of like the Jews being killed.  You're right, though.  They actually – it's a call for the left. 
[00:40:00]  They always use like the – ah, he's a Nazi.  He's a Nazi.  They always do kind of say that about conservatives.  O'Reilly is a douche if you're just tuning in.  I don't like him.  They break that word out, but I think – I can't see why, but, you know, I'm not Jewish, so, you know, who am I to say – who am I to say –  This is a rough one.  But you can't – you can call someone a Nazi if their ideology is leaning toward, you know, fascism. 
[00:40:30]  Why?  You can.  And, again, no one's saying that he should be constitutionally not allowed to do what he wants to do.  But the Zieg Heil, every time you mention someone's name, it's not like he said it one time in passing.  Like, this guy's a Nazi.  He might be hacky, but you should have the freedom to do it.  You should, but I understand the KDL on this one.  I agree with that.  Yeah?  All right.  Why don't we – I don't like any of that censorship stuff, especially when it's on a comedic or satirical level where the guy is.  He's not out there on TV trying to rally the troops, you know? 
[00:41:00]  I agree with you, but I just want this one to kind of agree with you.  I understand why they'd say that's a little offensive.  Every time he mentions it, to do this – all right.  Why?  I'm hacky now.  I'm not mentioning a rapist.  Talk about someone else.  You know, go after someone who's committed a rape and then, you know, mime a punch in a rape movement.  A rapist doesn't have better ratings than him.  The problem.  All right.  Let's move on.  We got Rich Voss in studio.  This is something we've wanted to play for a while now, and you know what?  Now that you're here, it's a perfect time. 
[00:41:30]  From time to time –  Is it like a holocaust?  From time to time, Rich Voss does stand-up comedy in the streets of New York.  A holocauster.  After we leave here at around 9 o'clock, we continue on XM, and we broadcast a walkover to XM exclusively on XM.  And we fool around in the streets of New York.  And from time to time, Voss joins us, and he gets into a place unannounced and does his comedy for everybody.  It's not a comedy club.  They are not expecting comedy. 
[00:42:00]  It is a place where people are just hanging out, having a little breakfast before they go to work.  Right.  And it's quiet.  Right.  There's only a few people in there.  And then in comes this crowd and a booming voice announcing this idiot.  And he goes into his act to people that just look confused.  Well, they're tired.  They just want to get their coffee and a little breakfast before work.  And here comes this just – yeah, like you said, a crowd of people just taking over the joint, and Voss starts doing his comedy live on the radio.  We got his latest set.  It's quick.  Or some highlights, anyway. 
[00:42:30]  It was Rue 57.  That's turning out to be a pretty nice comedy club, huh?  It's not bad.  At 9.15 in the morning.  Right.  The eight people really watched and turned around.  Yeah, like the last time I did Rue, I had like four people get up and walked out, left their home fries and toast.  Yeah, they were not happy.  They were happy.  This crowd was –  You doubled the crowd, and they stuck around for the show.  This crowd wasn't as hostile.  Let's go to Rich Voss at Rue 57 from about a week, week and a half ago.  Ladies and gentlemen, your first comedian this morning. 
[00:43:00]  From Last Comic Standing, please welcome Richard Voss.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, how we doing?  Awesome.  It's good to see you guys.  We're going to do a little show because my career is not going – this is how pathetic my life is.  I owe my eight-year-old six dollars for Girl Scout cookies, and I'm dodging her.  She calls me and tries to disguise her voice, but I know it's her, so go, hello, is Daddy home?  Not bad.  Sir, I'm doing a show you can watch.  Give me a few minutes, all right? 
[00:43:30]  What's your name?  Newman.  Newman.  Are you two married?  How – unfortunately, I got a car, and I'm not like the black guys.  I'll leave – well, anyhow.  Look, don't get upset, all right?  Turn on BET Comic View and watch black comics tricks, white people for an hour, all right?  White people crazy.  They pay taxes.  You know what I'm saying?  Loosen up.  We had the girl turn her back on me.  This is so awkward.  You got to understand, man.  Where are you guys from? 
[00:44:00]  What the heck is going on?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, this is so awkward, because these people aren't ready for comedy, and it's – you're  in just an extremely uncomfortable position.  And come – some of them kind of left.  And right before I walked in, too, Opie said do some old school, right?  I said go old school, because, I mean, we've been doing this bit for a while, so I was  thinking, you know, maybe throw some of your old stuff in there.  And my daughter's 16.  I go, she was eight years old.  Right.  Oh, wow.  All right, we got a little more.  Rich Vossett.  16 already?  16.  Rule 57.  Almost ready.  What country are you guys from? 
[00:44:30]  Where are you guys from?  Oklahoma?  There's a nice little Oklahoma pub you might want to go to on 168th and Amsterdam.  Pubby?  It's called Run Whitey Run.  Yeah, what's a pubby?  I said pub, didn't I?  I don't know.  There were words flying out of your mouth that I just want to get through this.  You said pubby.  Listen.  What country are you guys from?  Where are you guys from?  Oklahoma?  There's a nice little Oklahoma pub you might want to go to on 168th and Amsterdam. 
[00:45:00]  There's a nice to the Oklahoma.  He said there's a nice to the Oklahoma pub.  What did you?  I think Dummy actually said there's a nice little pub you might want to go to.  I think he said pub you might want to go to.  And it sounded like pubby.  Oh, did I?  Yeah.  Yeah, I probably said that.  Pubby is what I want to go to.  All I want to do is get through this before food comes flying at me.  Oh, it's great to listen to because it's so uncomfortable for everybody involved. 
[00:45:30]  It's like a robbery.  Like you get in and then you got to get out before the crap hits the fan.  Yeah, exactly.  As we were walking the last time, the manager said, keep it clean.  All right?  Now I got to do a clean set in front of the eight people.  You're going to have to send a tape?  Yeah.  It's a nice little Oklahoma pub you might want to go to on 168th and Amsterdam.  Pubby?  It's called Run Whitey Run.  I'm killing.  They're loving me. 
[00:46:00]  This is the best crowd I've worked in a while.  How you doing, sir?  Do you work here?  What's your name?  What's that?  Maurice, what was Lincoln like as a president?  How old are you?  Wait, what country are you from?  Bangladesh.  Do you know a guy named Frank?  I love Bangladesh.  Whenever I play...  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Where is Bangladesh?  I don't know. 
[00:46:30]  Do you know that you're the dumbest guy I've ever met?  It's Bangladesh.  What's it?  Bangladesh, Bangladesh.  There you go.  It's the same thing.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Bong the drum slowly.  Fool.  How many people really are using Bangladesh in a sentence?  No one knows.  Maybe three.  But everyone knows Bangladesh.  Everyone knows it.  Yeah, Bangladesh.  I mean, that, you know.  The concert for Bangladesh?  Yeah, with Ravi Shankar and George Harrison. 
[00:47:00]  Wow.  Don't try to save your intelligence dignity right now.  Because you know George Harrison, old pudding under the hat.  I beat you up hard so they don't remember my mispronunciation.  Just so you know, Ritz.  It makes me feel better about myself.  He read the lumps on his head.  You're going to die in two weeks.  Do you know a guy named Frank?  I love Bangladesh.  Whenever I played Ritz, that was the first country I'd take.  Right into Bangladesh.  You live here now? 
[00:47:30]  It's great.  You don't have to walk down to the river to do your laundry?  Nothing on that one.  Come on.  They're from Bangladesh.  Look at your crack.  This is the best that I've had in a while.  Got to say it five times.  I got to run.  We just wanted to do a few minutes.  If you're in town tonight, come to Caroline Cedar Show.  Sir, you can get in free.  And we're giving out stool softeners, okay?  You guys were the best eight people I've ever worked to.  Thank you.  I can't believe he killed. 
[00:48:00]  Come on.  I'm pissed.  That pisses me off that he did so well.  And there you have it.  Rich Voss doing comedy on the streets of New York City.  You know, Liz, you seem to have found a really cool angle to go in there.  Yes.  Steve from Bayshore sums it up well.  Voss is a bongla douche.  With that, we take a break.  We're late.  When we get back, we started this yesterday.  We'll continue.  Molly grows up next.  Oh, can't wait.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:48:30]  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Knockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh.  Yeah, we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  West Palm Beach.  Got to say hi to everyone listening to us on The Buzz in West Palm Beach.  The Buzz.  The Buzz is in the news today.  On the way, by the way, we got to do Molly Grows Up. 
[00:49:00]  But this has been brought to our attention.  It affects everybody listening to this radio show.  Oh, that's it?  Yes.  I understand traffic today is being held up because people are rubbernecking a white news van that's being searched by the police.  Oh, you naughty boy, you.  Oh, he is a naughty boy.  Oh, dear.  To all the dudes out there, you're not talking to a 13-year-old girl. 
[00:49:30]  Stop it.  Stop it now.  Oh, well, this guy was bamboozled.  They pulled the old bait and switch on him.  I like that, actually.  He had a 13-year-old girl.  But he got a little overzealous, a little rambunctious with her.  He had a 13-year-old on the line, and it fell out as he was pulling it out of the water.  What happened is a little fish.  And what a coincidence, he re-hooked the same 13-year-old. 
[00:50:00]  No, he was a much older fish.  Right.  You get a little fish on the line, and you reel it in, and all of a sudden he gets swallowed up by a big police officer.  By the time it gets to the boat, it's too late.  Are we sort of connected to a pedophile now?  Yep.  Because this guy worked at the Buzz in West Palm Beach?  What?  The first time?  I think we entertain all the nation of them.  Well, here's the story.  Bruno. 
[00:50:30]  Bruno Moore's traffic reports made him a familiar face in South Florida.  And then blah, blah, blah.  Worked for Metro Traffic.  Well, Tuesday, Moore's communications online landed him behind bars.  Earlier this summer, detectives say Moore, who worked part-time as a DJ at WIRK,  began chatting online with a 13-year-old girl.  Oh, boy.  I guess the girl had initially sent an instant message to the radio station requesting a song.  Requesting it right there.  Red flag. 
[00:51:00]  You don't write back.  E-Rock is an expert in West Palm Beach radio.  I thought he was going to be an expert in chatting with 13-year-old girls.  He's an expert in playing one because he likes older gentlemen.  E-Rock?  We should get an expert on 13-year-old girls in here.  Where's Travis?  His online name is Erica.  Erica.  Eric, what kind of station is WIRK?  Country station.  So this 13-year-old was requesting a country song, I guess?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Pumpkin.  Gets hotter. 
[00:51:30]  The girl.  Country song.  So she requested a song through instant messaging.  Police say Moore began sending sexually explicit messages from his MySpace page.  Jesus.  And through instant message.  You've got to have balls, man.  You know you're going to jail when you start doing that.  You know the end result here, you're going to jail.  Who is still doing this?  That's what amazes me because we've talked about the internet for many, well, since it  started, obviously.  But Anthony had the greatest way of describing the internet. 
[00:52:00]  When it first started, it was the wild, wild west.  Yeah, just lawlessness.  People were getting away with murder.  The pedophiles were getting away with this like it was nothing.  It was free smut, free freak show stuff, animals, whatever.  It was all over the place.  And you didn't have to pay for it.  You know, it would scroll down really slow from the top down.  But all kinds of porno and everything.  And now, you know, everything's payside and they've regulated things to clear up a lot 
[00:52:30]  of illegal stuff.  And they're really policing it.  So, yeah.  So, you know, a lot of these busts go down.  You read in the paper a lot of people end up in jail that were trading pictures or selling  pictures, illegal pictures of young girls and boys over the internet.  On just persecution.  I mean, you're right.  So, police say Morb began sending sexually explicit messages from his MySpace page and 
[00:53:00]  threw in some message.  Smart guy.  The girl told her mom, who then told police.  Oops.  So, she wasn't into this whatsoever.  No.  Like, like.  She was just requesting a song and this guy's thinking, yeah, there might be something there.  The sing operations.  You're going to get MySpace, like, regulated, like, for comics and people who are legitimately  using it to promote.  Well, this is.  Creeps.  And they're not going to be able to stop MySpace.  I hope not.  There's going to be a whole bunch of MySpaces popping up in the next year or two.  The usual thing here is it's not a real 13-year-old, you know, or it's not. 
[00:53:30]  It started out as a real 13-year-old.  Then this guy starts the sexually explicit chat.  She tells mommy.  Usually, it's a cop, and then they'll sexually explicit chat with you right back to try to,  like, rope you into a meeting.  You go there.  We all know how that ends.  We've seen it on Dateline.  It's very funny.  It ends as a comedy show.  Dateline.  Oh, what?  No, you're free to go.  Oh, did I tell you there's 18 cops out there ready to pounce on you? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, you're free to go as long as you can get through the maze that's waiting for you  outside.  There's a tree.  The cop trust is a tree who's going to grab you.  Don't be startled.  Right.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  Good luck in jail, too.  That's where the game show begins.  That's what they should do.  They should have two shows in one, right?  Start the Benny Hill music and then turn it into a game show hosted by Howie Mandel.  I don't know.  All right.  For a month, for more than a month, Detective Cass Collins chatted with Moore online.  Police say Moore thought he was speaking with the young girl.  And now they set it up as the usual thing where it's the cop playing the 13-year-old. 
[00:54:30]  And then Moore tried to meet the girl on many different occasions.  Before any encounter could take place, detectives arrested Moore at Sandy Pines, a psych treatment  facility in Martin County.  Moore was recently hired by the Martin County School District to teach English at the facility.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  They love getting themselves in those jobs.  Love getting into them jobs where they're around the children.  It's just trying to help the children.  Psych treatment.  And he should have known it was a cop because he said, like, you know, will you come see 
[00:55:00]  me?  And she's like, I'd love to.  That's hot.  Over.  Moore gave a full confession.  When I get off duty.  And he said, you are young.  Moore gave a full confession.  And he's been charged with six counts of child pornography and solicitation of a child.  Yikes.  He's 34 years old and has a young son. 
[00:55:30]  So that's the latest one getting caught.  They're getting caught every day.  You're not talking to the 13-year-old.  Let me tell you something.  I got a MySpace account.  I think we all do at this point.  I mean, everybody does.  I get, uh, is it really?  Yep.  All right.  Let me punch that up because that sounds kind of funny.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  His MySpace.  Oh, really?  You got his MySpace account?  Let's see.  Huh?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  He has 14-year-olds and 16-year-olds in his top eight right on the MySpace page. 
[00:56:00]  What an ass.  Is it right?  This is it right here?  Yeah.  This girl here?  Yeah.  Which girl?  The blonde one?  If you want to see it, it's MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  Oh.  Uh.  Let's see his, um.  Well, one of his top eight is this girl.  I can't pronounce her name.  Melissa.  I guess Melissa Da.  All right.  Female.  14 years old.  Uh.  Wow.  Let me tell you something.  That chick is unbelievably hot. 
[00:56:30]  I.  What do you want me to say?  Are you nuts?  You're nuts.  Look at her face.  Go back.  She looks like a 14-year-old aunt.  Maybe 16.  You would not confuse that for an 18-year-old.  Who's that really?  You could confuse that for 18.  No.  No way.  Couple of drinks?  She's sexy.  No?  No.  No way.  That girl is 14.  That girl is very cute.  And it does him to men.  All right.  Sexy.  So.  Do we have time for me to send her an ad meet as a friend? 
[00:57:00]  What are we saying about MySpace accounts?  Yeah.  Everyone's got one.  And we get messages or friend requests and stuff from underage kids all the time.  You know?  They listen to the show sometimes.  Their parents listen.  And I usually get the only time I've ever responded was one girl wrote and I go to her MySpace and it's her and a bunch of her friends.  I think she was 14 in bikinis, like grabbing each other, playing like grab chest and chasing each other around. 
[00:57:30]  Very like sexual, suggestive pictures.  Your acting stinks.  Why?  What's the matter?  He's saying this with his face on like he's disgusted.  No, I wasn't disgusted.  It was really hot.  But I'm not stupid to try to carry on a conversation with these people.  You were trying to pull one over on us, man, with that. 
[00:58:00]  So I said, no, you know me too well.  So the only thing I've ever written back, and I wrote back to her and said, because she said, my dad's a big fan.  He doesn't have a MySpace.  He wanted me to tell you that he's a big fan.  So I wrote back, tell your dad I said thank you, and to lock you in a room until you're 30 years old.  Unless you don't communicate with your dad.  In that case, send me some text.  Send me.  I'm willing to help you.  I could help, because they could all help.  Do you need a daddy figure?  Here's his bio here, this guy, Bruno. 
[00:58:30]  I'm 34, in the middle of a divorce as of April, and have a great son who I see every week.  Not anymore.  I am a local Fort Pierce boy who did a little South Florida tour coming back to Port St. Lucie.  Then he gets into the thing that he's in radio and TV.  He does commercial work, and yeah, his friends are young. 
[00:59:00]  Real young.  There's a 16-year-old, 14-year-old.  Ugh.  Rebecca's 16.  Oh, they're hammering the site now.  Oh, is that?  Melissa's 14.  Beauty and the Breakdown, 16.  Yeah.  Roman Polanski called him a creep.  Wow.  14 and 13.  He goes, I'm a young boy.  I'm a boy at 34.  Yeah, see?  Who called him a creep?  Roman Polanski. 
[00:59:30]  That was terrific, Voss.  Thank you.  I think a lot of people are...  I just wanted you to repeat it.  Isn't that a bad line?  A few people are commenting.  Somebody wrote, hey, man, I'm behind you all the way.  Most of the girls on MySpace lie anyway, so hang in there.  I'm sure it's all BS.  Like, he's getting supporters on his site.  You could bet he'll be getting a Jim Norton friend request.  That's not BS.  He is so screwed.  He's in deep trouble. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, there's a picture with him, with Carrie Underwood, who won American Idol.  Hey.  Look at that.  How about that?  No, I'm sure they got some great evidence on this guy.  Yeah, they got him a child pointing.  He probably has, like, pictures and stuff.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah, this is kind of funny, because, like, last month in Shreveport, Louisiana, they had  a sting in a hotel room, and they caught one of our local DJs.  I don't know if I can say his name on the air.  Why not?  I wouldn't, because I'm not sure if this story is true. 
[01:00:30]  I don't have it confirmed in front of me, so don't use his name.  Just say a country DJ.  And he got caught doing what?  A country DJ got busted for talking to girls online, and then he went to a hotel room,  evidently, to meet with one.  And he got the old police bracelet put on.  It's got to be such a letdown for these guys.  They're convinced that it's really going to happen.  Oh, boy.  And then they open the door, and they see the cop, and they're like, oh, man. 
[01:01:00]  This guy, did you open up all of his friends?  I've been checking it out a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got girls.  Country girl.  Uh-huh.  Another 14.  Girl is stunning.  Look at how nice.  All American.  She's got to be close to her 15th birthday.  I hope you're kidding.  I hope you're kidding.  She doesn't look anywhere near 18, that one.  What, that one?  No, man.  17.  What's the matter?  Fresh-faced model look.  Yeah, right.  Nice thing. 
[01:01:30]  You ever see those model searches?  They all grab up ones that are in their teens.  She looks like she just got her.  And throw makeup on them.  She looks like she just got her braces off.  How about shake that Laffy Taffy behind her eyes?  She's 18.  Right there.  Boy, this guy.  All right.  You can definitely tell.  Over there.  When a lot of your friends on the site are underage girls, girls that are just 18, that  could be a problem. 
[01:02:00]  When the background says daycare behind the picture.  These girls, like you say, though, they're taking wild, you know, they're doing pictures  of them and their friends.  You know, it's like girls gone wild, then they take a nap, you know, they're 13.  Well, the biggest problem is that there's no real way to regulate it.  I mean, there's so many people on here.  They can't go through every site.  A lot of these girls have digital cameras, so it's easy.  They just go in the room, snap off a few pictures. 
[01:02:30]  It's up online.  It's up online.  Good parents, though.  Good parents.  Why wouldn't they go to their kids' MySpace?  Yeah.  Well, that's the parents that know nothing about technology.  They don't go to their MySpace sites, anything like that.  Yeah, they should know about all that stuff.  You're going to be a parent.  Just stuffing their fat faces.  A nightmare.  That's kind of hard, though, man.  A lot of parents don't know about computers.  They're just so busy working.  All right.  In honor of the pedophile in West Palm Beach, we got tickets to OzFest. 
[01:03:00]  Nice tie-in.  Thank you.  If you're listening to us on The Buzz in West Palm Beach, we got five pairs of tickets  to see OzFest, August 13th.  At Sound Advice Amphitheater.  All right.  There you go.  Five pairs of tickets to see OzFest.  1-866-313-FREE.  We'll be hiding them somewhere in a pair of little patent leather shoes in West Palm Beach.  What could be worse than getting handcuffed?  You know, you're sitting at a hotel.  The fact that you're getting handcuffed or you wasted that Viagra. 
[01:03:30]  Well, that's just it.  Yeah.  You know these guys are all worked up into a frenzy, a lather.  And just, you know, probably running through their minds of the whole days or evenings events.  And then, get out of the vehicle.  Get out of the vehicle.  This is going to interfere with my sex.  And you're still holding, probably still holding out hope thinking, ah, man, I knew  I should have got my registration renewed.  What happened?  You're still not even thinking why they're there. 
[01:04:00]  It's my inspection.  Trouble officer?  Right.  Trouble officer?  I put my blinker on before I came in here.  I know I did.  You're parked with your pants out.  Was I speeding?  You're just in denial right up to the last second, thinking it has to be something else  you did wrong.  Officer, can we make this quick?  I'm supposed to meet somebody.  I know it was 20 mile an hour or speed zone outside the school.  I could have been going more than 27.  All day long practicing.  Don't tell anybody speech or your parents will get hurt. 
[01:04:30]  I'll kill the puppy.  No, officer, I had the belt on when I was driving.  I just took it off.  Right.  This ought to tickle me, Elmo doll.  Why?  Just complete denial.  No, that's what I drink my milk out of.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a problem.  You're under arrest.  Step out of the vehicle.  Is this going to take long?  Right.  I knew I really have things to do today.  I knew I should have fixed that taillight.  Everyone told me they'd pull me over for that.  I was holding out for hope. 
[01:05:00]  No, the baby sheet is I have a date.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  He's asking for license and registration.  You're still looking around the parking lot, wondering where, you know.  Hoping she doesn't get spooked.  Right.  Yeah.  Drive away.  Officer, could you leave?  I'm meeting someone that might be afraid of this police car.  Maybe you're in.  What a C block.  Yeah.  You know the cops probably say, sir, you expected to meet someone?  Yes.  No.  Oh. 
[01:05:30]  No.  Well, I, uh, I, uh, die.  What are you doing here today?  Uh, nothing.  Nothing.  That's the best thing to say to a cop when they ask you what you're doing here.  What are you doing here?  Nothing.  I hopped in my car, drove to this very spot, and stopped.  Nothing at all.  For no reason, officer.  I'm not buying drugs.  I'm not trying to have sex with anybody.  Um, nothing.  I just stopped to be.  Okay.  You're free to go.  Thank you, officer.  Sir, why do you have no inside passenger door handle? 
[01:06:00]  The lock's been removed on your, uh, they're on order?  Yeah.  Sir?  It's a problem.  All right.  We got to take a break.  When we get back, Mom.  The begging, oh, by the way, the begging is also the best thing.  The dateline thing uses it, but I've seen it on other shows where they actually think  the cop might say, all right, when they go, officer, please, please, please, I really  don't mean to do, please, could you just this time let me go?  Like they might see it his way for once. 
[01:06:30]  Like the cop's going to, you know, I am a little late for lunch and I'll never do it  again.  All right.  You promise?  Yeah.  Promise me.  Okay.  I would do that if I was a cop.  All right.  Look.  Promise me.  Look.  You promise me.  I'm never going to see you here again.  Because you know, it'd be, oh, yeah, no, no.  Never again.  Never.  Okay.  Dick.  Come here.  You're under arrest, you ass.  You silly goose.  You bought it. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, Bobby.  Bobby, I just pulled the old, he thought he was going to get away scam.  You got to see his face.  I got it on the dashboard cam.  A little laugh back at the precinct.  This is hysterical.  He really thought I was going to let him go.  No, he's right here.  He's crying.  Watch, I'll do it again.  Hold on, hold on.  Watch, watch this.  All right, look.  I'm taking the cuffs off.  You're going to get back in your car, but I got your name.  I know where you live.  I know you're married. 
[01:07:30]  And you want your family to find out about this.  It's over.  And you promise never again, right?  Oh, God.  Oh, never.  Promise never again.  Never.  I swear to you, I promise.  It's your first time, right?  This was your first time?  First time.  I've never done anything like this.  Look, we were talking outside the officers, and we've decided that this is your lucky day.  Officer, thank you so much.  This is, because my life would just be ruined.  Did you hear that one?  Because I got the mic key down.  Everybody.  Dude, they're all laughing at you.  It's on the dashboard camera. 
[01:08:00]  This is like a gag reel we play at the end of the year.  It's for our Christmas party.  Look, I'm willing to forget this if you are.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm willing to forget it if you...  Oh, absolutely, sir.  I do.  I mean, forget about letting you go.  I got him again.  Now he's in the back seat.  Yeah, like a baby.  Like a baby.  It's funny if you get stopped like that in the cosplay and you hit him a PBA card.  Does this help?  Right. 
[01:08:30]  A PBA card.  You make him believe the PBA card will get him out.  Oh, you got one of those.  Oh, well, now this is a little different.  All right.  Oh, you know this guy?  This is my buddy.  Yeah, I know.  He's your friend, too?  Yeah, how do you know him?  Oh, he's a good friend of mine.  Yeah?  The guy gave us to me.  We've hung out for years.  I've known him since high school.  You know him?  Yeah.  Go over to his house and play cards all the time.  All right.  Look, I'm going to call him up, though, and let him know what happened.  No, that's fine.  That's fine.  You do that. 
[01:09:00]  Did you hear it again?  Look, I thought I was going to let him go because of a PBA card.  A stupid PBA card.  Oh, God.  Watch me make him cry.  The black guys are going to love you in prison.  Like a baby.  His eyes are all red.  He's banging his head against the partition.  You know what would be great, though?  You actually let him go, and then your friend pulls him over a block away.  You give him a whole block of thinking, I can't believe it.  They let me go.  A whole block of relief. 
[01:09:30]  They let me go.  Oh, God, thank God.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  What is this?  Step out of the vehicle, please, pedophile.  But I was...  No, see, the other officer let me go.  Yeah, I know.  He told me.  This is what we do.  It's funny.  Yeah, we're bored today.  We figured we'd have some fun at your expense.  If you promise not to do it again, I'm just going to let you drive away.  I promise. 
[01:10:00]  I promise.  Shut up.  Get in the car, idiot.  Very good.  So that's what's going on.  What's the MySpace account?  A lot of these freaks want to check it out for themselves.  Oh.  It's crumbled up in my hand.  Wow, did I crunch that.  Bruno Moore.  Bruno Moore.  M-O-O-R-E.  There you go.  All right, let's take a break.  Molly grows up next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Let's give it the big plug here. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Get a wow on the vehicle.  For detailed instructions on how to get your very own wow sticker, visit opiananthony.com.  Wow stands for whip him out Wednesday.  We pretty much say at this point, whip him out whenever.  It's going to be whip him out any time, but that's why.  It works great when you're stuck in traffic going to a sporting event.  Wow.  One of these days you'd be driving.  Girl that's familiar with the program's going to see the wow, know what it means, pull up  next to you, and flash you.  It makes that commute so much better.  So there you have it.  Whip him out Wednesday. 
[01:11:00]  Opian Anthony.  The Opian Anthony Show.  Yeah.  God, we got lots to do.  We need at least another hour, two hours of radio today.  Oh, we get that on XM.  Nice.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We got to do Molly grows up.  Then we'll get into what's going on in Buffalo.  I guess there's a website out there.  They're trying to get us off the radio in Buffalo.  Have fun.  Without giving us a shot. 
[01:11:30]  We'll let the pest know about that.  Also, we got to get into flavor of love.  One of the greatest TV shows ever.  I say ever.  I think Flavor Flay is calling the show tomorrow, actually.  And we got Tommy coming in today.  Tom Morello from Audioslave stopping by to say hi today.  Bob Kelly calling in in just a bit.  What is he doing the best? 
[01:12:00]  Car.  Just about everything, actually.  Oh, I'm just sorry.  Reading this on this website.  Well, you can do it.  Let's do it real fast, and then we'll move on.  All right.  We're on in Buffalo.  On the edge.  On the edge.  We've replaced an old friend of mine, so it's a little weird.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's a little weird.  It's radio.  It's how it works in the way.  The big boys have to understand that's how radio works. 
[01:12:30]  We've been screwed plenty of times.  Believe me.  We've been thrown off the air.  Don't worry about it.  You've got to suck it up like a big boy and move on.  We're taking over the radio world, and people are getting hurt in the process.  Sorry.  And the Buffalo move is a little weird for me because back in the day, you know, I worked with Shred.  I consider ourselves still friends, even though we're not in touch as much as we used to be.  We don't know who put this website out.  No, I know.  I don't think there's any hard feelings between him and I, but Citadel thought it would be in their best interest to put us on in mornings in Buffalo 
[01:13:00]  and move Shred and Reagan to afternoons, which is a great opportunity for those guys,  which could lead, to be honest with you, to some nice syndication possibilities.  Exactly.  You know, but it's a little awkward because, like I said, we started together back in Buffalo many, many years ago.  You know, I'm not going to sit here and pat ourselves on the back either,  but do these people assume that every radio personality's name is put in a giant hat 
[01:13:30]  and then one is picked out and they get to do mornings all over the country and take over for jack off?  That went to Satellite and David Lee Roth that replaced them and stuff and then pick up markets one after another.  It's just like luck.  You've got to do a show.  You do a show that people enjoy that gets numbers and then you expand as a show.  That's just the way it works.  And that's what we're doing. 
[01:14:00]  We're actually out in Bangladesh now.  Bangladesh.  Right.  So apparently somebody got a website together.  It's been brought to our attention and I'm hearing another one of my friends in Buffalo Radio  is actually promoting this website and God, I hope that's not true.  No friends in radio.  And that's why I won't even say the name or anything.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  But man, I hope it's not true.  Check up on this.  If someone could get audio of that, wow, that would be very, very disappointing.  There's another person, by the way, who is in charge of this site, I guess, because he's 
[01:14:30]  got the letter that he's got on his website who thinks he represents everybody.  Another guy representing everybody.  Self-important idiot that thinks he represents everybody because it starts, Citadel Communications  executives, comma, on behalf of a large majority of radio listeners in the western New York  region, right there, on behalf of, you are now speaking on behalf of a large majority 
[01:15:00]  of radio listeners.  This is, this is the problem.  You self-important douche.  This is the problem in America, by the way.  It's the internet.  These special interest groups.  It's not even a special interest group.  This is a guy.  He's trying to start his own special.  Yeah, but some, there's other ones that are taken very seriously and they're just one  guy.  Yeah.  This is a douchebag with a blog and he's representing a large majority of radio listeners. 
[01:15:30]  Not even people that used to listen to the station that don't like us that left.  He's representing a large majority of the radio listeners in the western New York region.  They all got together and elected him.  They elected this ass as their spokesperson.  You're a nobody.  Fade back into obscurity when we're done reading your drivel, jackass.  Oh no, watch what we do after we read this letter.  Well then, the pests take over. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, we got a special surprise for this guy who signs his name, Bored Morning Commuter.  Yeah, good way to stay anonymous.  Faggot.  Oh, they'll find out who you are, believe me.  If you registered this website, it's over, Johnny.  The pests are roaches.  They crawl behind your walls.  They'll find out everything about you, you ass.  On behalf of a large majority, blah, blah, blah.  It is our request, our, that we protest the recent changes to the WEDG 103.3 schedule. 
[01:16:30]  The edge.  Specifically the importation of Opie and Anthony and the time bump of the Shred and Reagan show.  As a long-time dedicated listener to the SNR morning show and residents of WNY, Western New York.  A lot.  He's a real age.  It needs to be, he is.  CS.  It needs to be understood that the following should have been taken into consideration before making this change. 
[01:17:00]  And here is the following.  Opie and Anthony target a national audience with national news stories and don't care about Buffalo and its listeners.  We don't care.  We almost went to jail for you people.  Yeah, exactly.  We gave you T&A.  With O&A.  And it rocked.  It really did.  Ask anybody that didn't go to jail that day.  It was the greatest radio promotion Buffalo has ever seen.  The majority wishes to be heard loud and clear that the true beauty of Shred and Reagan is their ability to bring Western New York happenings because they are one of us. 
[01:17:30]  They know what it means to try to merge off the 33 and why Niagara Falls is one hell of a police blotter.  They're not doing the police blotter.  They have given us many comical mornings through the years, only to have it pulled as they climb to the top of morning ratings here in Buffalo. 
[01:18:00]  We, as ex-listeners, to the 103.3 Morning Show, choose not to support this decision and we'll continue to keep our CDs and non-citadel-based radio stations playing throughout our morning commutes.  This guy's going to make sure.  He's going to knock on everyone's window.  Do you think that people, when they're tuning in, go, is that Citadel or is it Citadel?  No one cares who owns it.  If they're laughing, they don't give a crap where it's coming from. 
[01:18:30]  And we make people laugh.  Radio from Mars, if it was funny, would be highly rated and regarded.  Never Jupiter.  I hate them.  That's right.  It's the first three letters you don't like.  Go ahead.  We believe that the assumed alteration is unnecessary and with great dissatisfaction.  That's right.  Dissatisfaction.  I, Rich Voss, and with great dissatisfaction, both to us as former listeners and to your pending business numbers, we hope you reevaluate your decision sincerely and in bold type, bored morning commuters. 
[01:19:00]  And then it has a section.  Sign the petition here with a little link to click on right after you read that manifesto.  Well, you ass.  I like the fact, and I don't know Shred and Reagan. 
[01:19:30]  They might do a great show.  I really don't know these guys at all.  I've met him over the years, and I've been friends with Shred for many years, and nothing, no problems.  No problems where I sit.  I like when he goes, they know what it means to try to merge off the 33.  Do you know when I'm listening to radio, I never care if they've ever merged onto the same roads I have ever.  I'm going to get some, I got to pump up some ratings here in New York.  Phil, excuse me for a minute.  Isn't that Queens Boulevard L.I.E. ramp a bitch? 
[01:20:00]  Dude, upper or lower level?  Come on, what do you do?  Sometimes the upper level has construction, and even the lower level of the Queensborough is just packed.  But then you go to the lower level, and it's crowded too.  And don't get me started on the BQE-Gowanus merge, because that thing, when is it ever going to be finished, people? 
[01:20:30]  And can we ever drive through there without a complete traffic jam?  And the belt during rush?  Both ways.  Are people coming to work or going to work?  You can't tell.  You can't tell both sides are crowded.  There we go.  Holy jeez, the New York numbers are shooting up, because I'm talking traffic.  You idiot!  Here's the deal.  Here is the deal, because a lot of people like to hide in radio.  Okay?  Here's a message.  Where are you, Ant?  What happened?  I'm hot!  Oh, Ant, stop! 
[01:21:00]  He didn't mean it.  What happened?  I hid.  Why?  It was coincidence.  You said a lot of people like to hide in radio, just as I was fighting.  How about bringing you the local flavor?  Here's the deal, and I want the ONA pest on this mission.  I want this to get back to Shred and Reagan.  If you have a problem with us doing moorings and you guys being moved to afternoon drive,  you call this radio show, and we'll discuss it.  We'll discuss it like gentlemen.  No more hiding and maybe having secret emails going back and forth. 
[01:21:30]  By angry commuters.  Or saying things in code on your show.  I say this today.  If you have a problem with this move, I want to hear from you personally.  And if there's another DJ at the edge that is promoting this website, I want him to call this show too and tell me what the problem is.  No more hiding.  It's in the open.  Let's go.  Let's talk about it.  In the meantime, what was the website?  Let's talk about it.  Now you're in a tough position.  Do you talk about it or not?  Yeah.  Do you call us or not? 
[01:22:00]  Is it a problem or is it not a problem?  And for the pest, the website is fixtheedge.com.  Push the button!  Fix the edge dot com.  There is a little link there where you can sign the petition thing and add a comment.  Here's the thing.  Nobody cares.  There's some comments on here.  Well, here's the deal.  Before you read the comments.  Yeah.  Destroy the website.  Yeah.  That's what I say today. 
[01:22:30]  Destroy the website.  Make it known we're not effing around.  Watch what the O&A pest can do.  So, fixtheedge.com is going bye-bye.  And get info, guys.  We know the pests are very resourceful.  Find out everything you can about this website.  Who set it up?  And, um, give us the intel.  He's wrong.  There's a lot of pests.  Oh, my God.  The pests are hysterical.  It's all pests. 
[01:23:00]  Lonesome golfer is the name.  My favorite, 181st signature, little sack of nothing.  I feel bad for the two guys.  Maybe we can all get together and work this out.  August 26th at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Homes.  Celine Dion checked in.  Get Shred and Reagan a kayak to help them with their show.  Bring an O&A so they can just touch them.  Well, they only have 181 signatures, and most are from our listeners. 
[01:23:30]  So, you're failing miserably, whoever's hiding behind this website.  Great job.  And whoever has a problem with us moving to mornings on the edge, you can call right now.  Right now, you can call.  We'll talk this over.  Scott from Modesto.  Stop hiding.  No hiding.  Oh, Scott from Modesto.  Blueberries signed it.  Yep.  That's what I like.  Oh, now we're in trouble.  If we lose Blue Breeze.  Blue Breeze.  All right.  We wanted to do Molly Grows Up, but now we had to get into this. 
[01:24:00]  The pests are such complete asses.  Death Metal Mo writes, I just wanted to say I love O&A.  I have no idea who Shred and Reagan are, and then my armpits smell outstanding.  Punch of asses listening to this show.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Have fun with this little website.  Nobody cares about petitions.  When Upper Brass makes a decision, it's like when a girl leaves you for a hotter guy, you're not getting her back.  Oh, boy.  You guys are the hot chicks coming in.  Thanks, Voss.  Upper Brass? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that was great.  Rich, that's like saying bigwigs.  Upper Brass.  Well, what do you say?  What else would you call it?  Forget it.  We're so late.  Oh, come on.  Let it drop.  Because we've got to get to Molly Grows Up.  We never get to anything on this show.  Well, we can do the Heather Mills, because that's a quickie, before we take a break.  And then we can do Molly Grows Up, okay?  Okay.  What are you laughing at?  Just reading how people are spelling Jupiter because of Jimmy's comment. 
[01:25:00]  But you guys got an open invite there in Buffalo.  You have a problem with the move and you work for the edge, you call us and we'll discuss it.  Stop hiding.  Stop hiding.  We'll discuss it.  Stop it.  Here's the latest on Heather Mills.  In our number two story, somebody's knocking at the door.  Somebody can't get in.  Mills McCartney apparently arrived at the London home, unable to enter.  Looks like the front gate's been locked, so her security attempts to scale the wall, prompting staff inside to call the pobis.  Heather speaks to the po-po and after a few frenzy phone calls, the matter was resolved. 
[01:25:30]  In the latest development, Paul and Heather just hired the same lawyers who handled Prince Charles and Diana's divorce.  And he'll be paying for those.  He's a dope.  He deserves it.  Why would you marry this pig without a prenup, you idiot?  You got children who want your inheritance.  Why would you do that to your children, you dope?  He certainly has enough to go around, though.  Yeah, he's a dummy.  He deserves it.  He really is a dummy for not having a prenup. 
[01:26:00]  He's one of the richest guys in the world.  Yeah.  It's funny, though.  She's scaling the walls of her own home trying to get in.  How could she do that?  With one leg stuck in the mud.  You hear?  You know, they showed a picture of her in the paper today wearing a skirt and open-toed sandals.  Can you tell?  We had a little discussion.  I think we decided the left leg, her left leg, is the wrong one over her shoulder like a rifle. 
[01:26:30]  A tan.  What side is that one leg?  Our false limbs allowed in the barracks.  Yeah, she's got her skirt on, open-toed shoes.  She must have used some of that McCartney money to really get herself a really good leg.  But then we could tell by the ankle.  I guess...  Oh, now I've got to see the picture.  Yeah, the ankle.  I get the real one. 
[01:27:00]  You can see it's a little veiny.  A little, like, bumpy and real.  And the other one is, like, this perfect, smooth ankle.  This is made in Korea.  Her toenails were done with varnish.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  Molly grows up.  We've been trying to get to this for an hour.  We've been sidetracked again.  We have four clips to play.  It's really, really good stuff.  And Robert Kelly checking in a little bit.  And Tom Morello is in studio in about a half hour. 
[01:27:30]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  A quick update before we move on.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, by the way.  Tickstheedge.com is getting killed.  Me and Anthony are all over to the shoulder reading these. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  The pests are hysterical.  When we get to XM, we're going to read a lot of these, I think.  But it's kind of hard to do here on Terrestrial.  There are some funny names and funny posts.  They're slamming them.  There are well over 500 total signatures now.  It was 181 when we started.  Just minutes ago was just over 100.  And now some of their comments and the names that they're using are hysterical.  Hi, Daddy.  And the pests, very resourceful, have already found the guy's name, address, phone number 
[01:28:30]  that runs this site.  So I guess we can send him an invitation if he wants to come on the show and discuss it  like a human and discuss the fact that he's representing all listeners in Western New York.  And for anyone at the edge that has a problem with this move, you could call the show right now.  Stop hiding.  Let's discuss this, okay?  Yep.  Dan in Buffalo, what's going on? 
[01:29:00]  Dan.  Dan in Buffalo.  Dan.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up?  What's the beef with Shredder Reagan?  I don't have any beef with Shredder Reagan.  No beef.  Shredder has the utmost respect for you guys, and you guys say you don't have a problem with  him, and then you turn around and say, if they've got a problem, be a man and call you  guys up.  What did we say?  What did we say?  That's not what we say!  You're a not-listening ass.  We're talking about a website called FixTheEdge.com.  Why don't you listen, Dan?  You're a jackass. 
[01:29:30]  You're not even listening to what we're saying.  I listen to everything that you say.  No, then you heard wrong.  You jerk-off.  Listen to me.  I'm a jerk-off.  Yes, you're a jerk-off.  You're a jerk-off.  We're going to say who's a jerk-off.  Why don't you guys bring your little comedy show to Buffalo and see what happens.  We will.  What are you going to try to beat us up, Dan?  What are you going to do, Dan?  Come to it.  You faggot.  What are you going to do, Dan?  What are you going to do, Dan, if we come to Buffalo with our comedy show?  In between the laughs, you're going to try to punch us in the face?  Is that it, Dan?  Or are you just all talk? 
[01:30:00]  Are you all talk?  Are you all talk?  I'm not all talk.  I'm not all talk.  I'm not all talk.  What's your problem with the show, Dan?  I don't have no problem with your show.  I like your show, but I do miss my morning show in Buffalo.  Well, obviously, a lot of people are missing their morning show in Buffalo.  They were on the air for, what, over a decade.  We've been on, what, a week, two weeks?  Of course people are missing.  And that isn't even the point.  The point is you weren't listening because we weren't trashing Shred and Reagan.  There's something going on.  There's something going on in Buffalo. 
[01:30:30]  We want to get to the bottom of it.  Hope was talking about someone disconnected from their show.  If you want us to break the 318th wall, not either one of those guys.  He wanted to know if somebody else was involved who he didn't want to name out of courtesy in case it wasn't.  Yeah, because he's an old friend of mine, and I'm hearing that he's promoting this website.  But I'm not going to go after him until I get my info right.  And he wasn't talking about Shred and Reagan.  And, Dan, you listening?  What's the website that we were talking about that's bashing us?  What is it?  I don't know. 
[01:31:00]  You said you were listening.  Because you're not listening.  Holy Jesus Christ.  I want to punch you in the face.  We gave out the website.  You are an ass.  Why don't you comb your hair, buddy?  Why aren't you comb your hair, buddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Hey, Dan.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Name the website, faggot.  You said you were listening.  You were listening.  You gave it out.  Name the website.  Yeah, go screw.  Yeah, you're listening, all right.  Shut up. 
[01:31:30]  You're a dummy.  I'll see you on the stage at Darien Lake, all right, Dan?  Incoherent jerk off.  I'll be looking for you.  You're a girl.  Let's go to Chris.  What's up, Chris?  What's up, honey?  Welcome aboard, Chris.  We didn't say anything bad about Shredder Reagan.  Trust me.  No.  It's idiots like that that just, like, spread this crap around.  But I've been getting emails and other people that have gone to events and there's things  being said.  So I want to see what's real and what's not.  That's what I'm getting at.  Clear it all up. 
[01:32:00]  And I'm not going to mention the name of the DJ at the edge because he's an old friend  of mine and out of respect for that, I'm not going to, like, start crap just in case it's  all BS.  I understand.  But something is going on up there and we're going to get to the bottom of it because we  don't hide behind our computers.  That's one reason why we're very successful.  We don't hide.  If anyone up there at that station has a problem with us, you call us and we'll discuss it.  Okay.  What's up, Chris?  Well, you know, people don't like change.  They've been here for over a decade and you guys come on and, of course, people are going 
[01:32:30]  to get pissed off.  I mean, I was upset when you guys came on because I love listening to them.  Yeah.  I'm giving you guys a chance and, you know, you guys are all right, but they were stupid  funny and you guys are kind of excessively stupid and I don't find it as funny as them.  All right, so then maybe you're not going to become a listener.  What can I tell you?  Don't listen.  We'll get plenty of listeners in Buffalo.  I guarantee that.  I guarantee that.  We already have a nice fan base up there, you know, from the last time.  That's right.  Keep listening and maybe it'll grow on you.  Right now, you're still in the I'm pissed off phase or I'm not used to this phase. 
[01:33:00]  Give it a little time.  Give it two, three years and if it doesn't grab you, then maybe you should listen to something  else.  How's your traffic on 33?  I'll take the 33.  All right, Chris.  I will listen to you guys and I'll see what goes on.  All right.  Yeah, give us, that's all we ask is you give us a shot.  That's all.  We are very, very funny.  We can't compete against a show that was on for over a decade.  You got, you know, not after a week anyway.  You got to give us a little time. 
[01:33:30]  We actually have a funny contest we do here that we bring in a bunch of women and you  have to guess which one is pregnant by running at her and tackling.  Oh, got to laugh at you.  You know the deal, right, with our show.  If you laugh, you got to send a check to us.  That's right.  Guy that owns the website, they've just found his MySpace.  We get a picture of the guy and everything.  Because we're sick of people.  Look at this jackass.  We're sick of people that hide behind their computers.  So fixtheedge.com is really screwed today. 
[01:34:00]  If he liked, if he, like, I don't blame the guy for wanting shredding reggae.  Those are his guys.  That's cool.  But I would respect him if he just used his real name more.  I have this hatred of people who languish in anonymity.  Wow, he's only got four comments?  Oh, no.  That'll change.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  All right, listen.  Molly grows up.  We'll be keeping close attention to this situation in Buffalo.  All right?  And the invite is there.  Stop the little secret conversations and the emails and the whispering at events and stuff. 
[01:34:30]  Let's get into it.  What's the problem?  We'll talk it out.  We'll see if you have balls.  Or maybe there's no problem whatsoever.  We'll see.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Molly grows up.  We started this yesterday.  We got to get back to it.  One of these old educational films.  These things are my favorites.  By the way, on standby, because we're running out of show today, we have – where's the one Danny just gave me?  Dating Do's and Don'ts from 1949. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  We'll do that on tomorrow's program.  Don't ever bring home a Negro.  First thing I thought of.  Of course.  49.  Tell your father he works in a chimney.  Why did I rip off your 1949?  That's okay.  That's great.  Oh, you have to talk like this.  Whenever you address the 40s, a Lucky Strike cigarette while you're pregnant will make your baby healthy. 
[01:35:30]  They knew everything back then.  Yeah.  Well, we'll do that tomorrow.  The Dating Do's and Don'ts from 1949.  But today it's Molly grows up.  She's getting her –  It's her time.  It's her time.  For the first time.  Yeah.  And she went to her mommy to get some info.  Right.  We've got to play the two clips we played yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Just to get everyone up to speed, including Cape Cod, because we're on there today.  We didn't even know ahead of time.  So welcome, Cape Cod, to the ONA virus. 
[01:36:00]  You're like, what the hell is this?  Give it some time.  This is what it is.  All right.  Yeah, it doesn't get much better than this.  All right.  Let's see.  Yeah, all right.  We'll play this first clip here again.  Is that you, Molly?  Yes, Mom.  Hi.  What kind of a day did you have today?  Mom, guess what?  I don't know.  What?  Mom, I started my first period.  Well, what do you know? 
[01:36:30]  Come on, sit down.  Tell me about it.  When did it start?  Well, it was this afternoon when I was changing into my gym clothes, and I noticed a bit of  on my panties, and golly, at first I thought, well, I didn't know what to think.  And now I remembered when we talked about menstruation and stuff, and, well, then I went to see Miss  Jensen.  Oh, my goodness.  How do you feel?  Kind of funny-like. 
[01:37:00]  I mean, well, I was hoping it would start soon, but it seems like I've forgotten everything  you've told me.  All right.  I'll tell you what we'll do.  Tonight will be mother and daughter conference night.  And if you'll give me a hand with supper, we'll get started that much earlier.  Okay.  I'll wash up and be right there.  Yeah.  Wash up good.  Kid gets out of bed, and it looks like Jack Waltz's place.  Don't tell your father what's surprising when he walks in your room.  And she went upstairs to check her MySpace account and see how many creeps are trying 
[01:37:30]  to get a hold of her.  Looks like someone was playing bingo on her chair.  So, there you go.  There's the setup.  Good old Molly.  Molly.  Her first time there.  They're going to have a little conference about it.  Oh, dear.  All right.  Here's the next.  Mom's going to help her out.  Yeah.  Here's the next clip.  The phone rings.  We played this yesterday.  And now Molly has to explain to a friend why she can't go swimming. 
[01:38:00]  Because she has the curse.  Of course.  She has the curse.  Curse.  I'll get it.  That's probably Peggy.  Gotta love the acting, by the way.  Yeah.  It's like sitcom acting from the early 50s.  Old lady names.  Right.  Hello?  Oh, hi, Peggy.  Peggy.  Sure.  Mrs. McCartney call.  Mom.  Peggy.  Can I go swimming with Peggy tomorrow after school? 
[01:38:30]  I don't think I would, Molly.  No.  But I'd be home by 5.30.  Not the time, you idiot.  No, it's not a good idea, Mr. Smith.  Yes.  Well, the mother just went, I said no.  You jackass.  It's like throwing a fizzy into the pool.  Yeah.  Peggy's father.  Who threw the maraschino cherries into the skimmer?  I tell you kids once, I've told you a thousand times.  Why are sharks knocking on our door?  What a dope. 
[01:39:00]  Other people in the neighborhood are dipping Easter eggs in the pool.  Mama, the Easter eggs smell like copper.  Oh, wow.  But I'd be home by 5.30.  No, it's not a good idea the first two or three days of your period.  No.  You might get chilled and catch cold.  Oh, that's right.  Peggy, of course I can't go swimming.  Yeah.  You know I've got the curse. 
[01:39:30]  The curse.  That's right.  It isn't a good idea the first couple of days.  Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  The pool cabana looks like the shower scene in Scarface.  It's like the Ten Commandments.  What?  Someone has to part the pool.  I didn't get it, boss.  But then I did.  Is there more of this? 
[01:40:00]  Please.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Well, here we go.  I like this.  And it's educational.  Yeah, Molly grows up.  Here's the third track.  Miss Jensen, is it true that people can tell when you're menstruating?  No, it isn't.  But you should be more careful than ever.  But dogs can tell.  Yes, they don't call you for a week.  Yes, every time you turn around, they drop the C-bomb to whoever's listening. 
[01:40:30]  The boys will steer clear.  Here's your Kevlar you have to bolt on to yourself because we haven't invented this yet.  Can they tell when you're menstruating?  Yes, it's when they say something and you castrate them.  They sense it.  But you'll be a real bitch on wheels.  Miss Jensen, is it true that people can tell when you're menstruating?  No, it isn't.  But you should be more careful than ever about personal cleanliness and dainties. 
[01:41:00]  Change your underwear more often and be sure and use a deodorant.  And pay more attention to your hair and your nails.  And plan to wear your prettiest dress.  In other words, be your most attractive self.  Why?  Why?  Like distract people?  No, so people get their hopes up to take you home, take your pretty dress off.  And then yikes.  Yeah, ouch.  She's wearing a chastity belt.  Deodorant?  Was she bleeding under the arms?  What do you use deodorant for?  Well.  You got to be nice and, you know, be at your best for some reason. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know why.  Probably to distract a homicide scene you're walking around with.  And be sure to wear police tape around your waist.  I just spit water everywhere and I cursed.  Yeah, I heard that.  I hope it didn't mess up your line.  That was really funny.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Travis in Maine.  Travis, what's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[01:42:00]  Hello, young lady.  Oh, sorry.  Wrong Travis.  Tell you what, this is the funniest stuff I've heard in a long time.  Where the hell did you guys find this stuff?  It's probably online or something.  These guys are good.  They always find, our guys find the weirdest online stuff.  Oh my God, I'm dying rolling in my truck here.  I about hit four or five people already listening to this.  The old I almost hit people gag.  Thank you.  He's being sarcastic.  Travis, what's the problem?  No problem.  I just want to say that I'm glad we got you guys in here on Maine friggin' radio. 
[01:42:30]  Finally something worth listening to.  Oh, okay.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Talon the trucker.  Talon, what's up?  Hey, yeah.  Is this Molly's first miscarriage?  Would that be what she did?  Jumping jacks and jump flops?  Have a nice day.  Have a nice day.  Yeah, right on.  A little uncalled for.  Here's the final track of Molly Grows Up.  Love Molly.  Miss Jensen, what about dancing?  Can you when you're menstruating?  Yes, you can.  With moderation.  In fact, you can do most of the things you usually do. 
[01:43:00]  You can bathe or shower as long as you use warm water.  What?  And you can wash your hair if you're sure to dry it quickly.  You can dance, but don't breakdance into a headspin.  Otherwise, your apartment will look like modern art.  Please dance under this sawdust.  What the hell was the wash your hair, but make sure you dry it quick?  This advice stinks.  It really is awful.  What is that?  I don't get it.  Can I dance?  Yes, but you see this tube sock? 
[01:43:30]  Fill it with sand.  I think I'm pretty, you know, knowledgeable on the female anatomy and biology.  What is it with washing the hair and drying it quickly?  That has anything to do with a girl during that time?  And why only warm water?  Yeah, warm water.  No clue.  Is it perhaps thinking that maybe you're losing some body heat?  And to keep your core temperature right? 
[01:44:00]  No way.  They want to dry it quickly because when you're standing in a puddle with electrical stuff.  Is that it, man?  It's like witchcraft?  Is that what it was?  Back then they thought it was some kind of witchcraft.  Witch!  Well, they call it the curse.  The curse.  How do I get rid of the curse?  Well, these are leeches, dear.  You can shower as long as you use warm water.  And you can wash your hair if you're sure to dry it quickly.  And you can swim if you wait until after two or three days after the beginning of your period. 
[01:44:30]  And you can go to dances and picnics.  But it's not a very good idea to skate or ride horseback or play fast games like volleyball and basketball.  Or do strenuous.  No horseback riding.  Don't do anything.  Especially with a white horse.  Oh, my God.  Somebody shot our horse.  She's reenacting Custer's last stand.  All you hear is the horse looking over its shoulder going.  I'm saying, get this off me in horse talk. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, great.  Now my back looks like Lucille Ball.  Could you fix that, please?  Don't ride a horse.  Play volleyball, kickball, baseball.  Don't do anything.  Just go home.  No splits on the linoleum.  No skating.  No skating.  Yeah, why not?  You can't do anything, girls.  No one can skate behind an oil slick.  Just stay home.  Skate.  Or ride horseback. 
[01:45:30]  Or play fast games like volleyball and basketball.  Or do strenuous dancing like square dancing.  Or anything that bounces you around a lot.  In general, mild exercises are best.  Ones that strengthen the abdominal muscles are particularly good.  It's sensible to avoid strenuous exercise when you're menstruating.  And you'll be sure and tell your mother or me if everything doesn't seem to be just right.  That's great.  Wow.  No square dancing?  They didn't know what the hell was going on back then.  Swing your partner. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  Dance over.  Work on your ab muscles?  And if a newscaster from West Palm gets a hold of you.  And remember, no mechanical bull riding during this time.  A kid set you off like a sprinkler.  And you can have athletic things, but no Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  No extreme fighting. 
[01:46:30]  And be courteous and don't go on the Ferris wheel.  And no parachuting, where people will think it's the apocalypse.  Renee on Long Island.  You know, women really have to go through this kind of stuff.  And I have daughters who should be explaining everything to me from watching these horrible tampon commercials that are played on Cartoon Network.  On Cartoon Network?  Really?  They're playing like women's hygiene equipment commercials? 
[01:47:00]  I'm in their hygiene.  Yes.  How do they explain it on the Cartoon Network?  Well, let's just keep it at that.  She'll say it again.  How do they explain it on the Cartoon Network?  Does Bugs hold one up and go, guys, if you see this, get out of the house for a week?  He starts chomping on it.  What's up, Doc?  It didn't look like a carrot when we started, but now it does.  We're going to have a rabbit.  Bloody.  Do one whole week with no fun. 
[01:47:30]  Now I got to go back to the ship and get another one.  So, Renee.  Sir?  Yeah, it's funny.  Yeah.  You're saying you had to grow up with this crap.  I was definitely told as a young girl you cannot go swimming.  You shouldn't dance.  And if you're premenstrual, you shouldn't do too much dancing or dance too hard because that'll bring on your period.  I think if you sneeze, you'll bring on your period.  And while we didn't call it the curse, it was something that you, you know, you did or did not want to look forward to. 
[01:48:00]  And then, of course, you were told how to use the tampon machines in the bathroom with safety pins back in the bad old days before adhesive and whatever.  And just, it was just something that as a child, it was, it was the whole aura.  Now when I tried explaining it to my kids, they were sitting and correcting me.  All right.  So when you sneeze, you got to ask for two napkins?  All right, Renee.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  All right, bye.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey, Max.  I wonder if Molly goes mountain climbing and she's the last one on the rope.  She's punching out.  I got it.  That's pretty good.  All right.  Well, tomorrow, Dating Do's and Don'ts from 1949.  Dating Do's and Don'ts.  After Molly goes mountain climbing, the rope looks like the one in Poltergeist that came through the other side.  Chuck in Jersey.  Chuck.  Hey, you might want to tell Molly to forget the pogo stick. 
[01:49:00]  It'll look like a paintball scene.  That's a good one.  I said paintball yesterday.  Yeah.  This is a new day.  All right.  Hey, do you want to go see the ONA Traveling Virus at the PNC Bank Arts Center on August 26th?  I do.  We're talking to a lot of the country, but we do have a great comedy show here in Jersey on August 26th.  Text the word Norton to 69923.  The 90-second text message wins a pair of tickets to the comedy event of 2006.  Text now Norton to 69923. 
[01:49:30]  Brought to you by Bud Light.  When we get back, I believe we'll be talking to Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine and Audio Slave.  And hopefully we'll get into some other things before we get out of here today.  It's the ONA Virus spreading across America.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:50:00]  The ONA Virus spreading across America.  A very busy morning today.  We've got to talk about Flavor of Love tomorrow.  The greatest show on TV.  It really is.  You like it, Tom?  I enjoy that show.  Did you check out the new season yet?  I saw about half an episode and it looks like there's love in the air.  The show started with two of these ghetto girls just beating the crap out of each other.  One girl slamming the other girl's head against the wall trying to pull out her hair extensions and pull out the other girl's hair.  And then the episode ends with one of the girls dropping something on the carpet. 
[01:50:30]  That's called ratings, my friend.  Dropping something on the carpet because she...  Like a dogwood in the street.  There you go.  That's a strong start.  Wow.  An amazing start for the show.  And the papers are saying today the biggest show VH1 has ever seen as far as ratings and how many people are watching.  Give the people what they want.  Since when you call Jimmy's chest the carpet.  Oh.  But they got even more ghetto with the show. 
[01:51:00]  Clearly there's a sweeps week or something on the air.  People love it.  I got into this dumbest reality show but I'm completely into it.  People get like entrenched in some of them and you don't understand why.  It's that stupid Hell's Kitchen.  I hate Hell's Kitchen.  I can't take any...  I sit there and go, I'm watching people cook.  I mean, I'm watching people cook. 
[01:51:30]  But there's just something about the...  What's his name there?  Ramsey?  The chef?  The yelling at them.  That is hysterical.  Like he'll call these women that are trying to...  They're like, yes, chef.  Yes, chef.  And he's ordering them around and he'll go, are you listening to me, you fat cow?  Like right up to their face.  And I find that hysterical.  When he just bashes the people.  Especially when he calls the women fat cows.  And I'm fixated on it.  And it's a stupid cooking show. 
[01:52:00]  I watch Flavor of Love.  I watch Celebrity Fit Club.  To that I lost the...  I watch Tabloid Wars.  No.  Future generations may judge us harshly.  Yeah.  You think?  Yeah.  But you don't even mean to though.  It's not like I went, ooh, a cooking show.  No.  Let me...  You get roped in.  And then before you know it, you're watching it every week and DVRing it.  That's great.  Reality shows are great.  Girls Next Door.  Do you watch Girls Next Door?  Is that the Hef one?  The Hef thing?  No. 
[01:52:30]  Oh my God.  There's too many on for me to even deal with.  Hef has the three girlfriends and they were throwing him an 80th birthday party.  And the one girl was practicing coming out of a cake, a birthday cake, that old gag.  Yeah.  She was practicing her dance in front of her mom and her stepfather.  Oh, that's healthy.  Jumps out of the cake and now she's got nothing but little, little tiny pasties on.  They're pretty much showing the girls nude now.  When I'm doing the tabloids.  Right, right.  In front of my stepdad.  And the stepfather can't help himself. 
[01:53:00]  He's like, he's like fanning himself like, oh my God, my stepdaughter's so hot.  Gawking?  You gotta watch Girls Next Door.  No.  And then they write little cards and love letters to Hugh Hefner that are hilarious.  Like, they're really in love with the guy.  Sure they are.  Yeah, we're buying into that.  Yeah.  On last comic, the guy with multiple sclerosis made the finals.  Oh, no.  Just stop right there.  But nobody could, none of his friends could vote for him.  What did he have?  What did he have? 
[01:53:30]  Well, I don't know.  What did I say?  What did he have?  I don't even know what you said.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sclerosis?  I don't know.  Sclerosis?  What is?  He's 48 years old.  You could be the dumbest man.  Bitch.  Well, Tom, obviously a great musician so he could appreciate your other flub.  The country.  Or the nation.  Or whatever it is.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Where they make the bongs.  But he's not a wacky, like, radio character.  This is Rick Rage.  Yeah, that's really the way he is. 
[01:54:00]  It's sort of like reality radio.  He makes us living talking.  Wow.  Anyway, we got to say hi to Tom Morello.  We went off on a little tangent there with Flavor of Love and all that.  You talk like you have the disease you can't even say.  I have the curse.  You do have the curse.  The curse.  And you put the thing in your mouth.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  How are you doing?  I'm well.  How are you?  I know.  This is being broadcasted.  This is just the show when we're on the air.  I'm reading your mind.  Yes, this is going out there to many, many people. 
[01:54:30]  Tom Morello, of course, of Audioslave and Rage Against the Machine back in the day.  Still love my Rage Against the Machine.  Can't get enough.  It's a lot of airplay.  It's amazing.  Did you guys ever officially release that Greatest Hits CD?  No.  Yeah.  I got one.  You got it?  I got one.  When those jams come on the radio, I still turn them up, too.  And it was sent to me, and I'm like, oh, cool.  Was it supposed to be a Greatest Hits thing?  No, I think it was sort of like a collection of singles I think they sent out to radio and stuff.  Oh, okay. 
[01:55:00]  Because I got it, and I can't get enough of it still to this day.  And then Audioslave.  Who knew?  Yeah.  Who knew that you would have a second hit?  Yeah.  A second band that hit, I should say.  But Chris Cornell, one of the greatest voices in rock music ever.  That's true.  That's amazing.  We don't take it for granted.  No?  Yeah.  And well, you shouldn't, sir.  I agree.  I almost hooked up with a really hot stripper because of you guys.  Last time you were in, the whole band was in the studio.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  No, I missed because even you guys couldn't completely get me there, but you got me closer than I deserve to be. 
[01:55:30]  So I have a photo with the band, and she's like, I love Audioslave.  I work out with them.  How'd you meet them?  We just started talking, and it went really well until I went in for the move.  And then it was like, yeah.  Over.  Yeah.  My fat newt face.  Your breathe right strip got in the way.  Yeah.  Lean in for the kiss, and she's like, I'll die already.  Is that menthol?  But yeah, so you got me closer.  I appreciate it.  I'm pleased.  And I don't know if I've talked to you since, but you turned us on to the documentary you guys did,  the DVD of you guys going to Cuba.  That's right.  That's right.  And I went home, and wow, that was great.  It was quite a time. 
[01:56:00]  It was just absolutely amazing.  How many people did you guys play in front of?  We were about 70,000.  70,000 people came out to see Audioslave in Cuba.  Yeah, it was pretty much.  And they documented their whole trip, and I just thought it was really amazing.  What I found fascinating was the park with John Lennon.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there were a lot of surprises on that trip.  There's like this park dedicated to John Lennon, a statue of him there.  Not only a statue, but a statue with glasses that are removable.  Yeah.  And they've only been stolen, what, twice or something like that? 
[01:56:30]  A lot of years, yeah, yeah.  Got to love communism, man.  They are scared S-less that they're able to keep these glasses that you can remove on a statue,  and no one's going to remove them.  That's right.  Except for a couple of dopes, and I'm sure they're dead now.  Cornell took them off the statue.  Did he?  But he did put them back.  Yeah.  And now they're saying, Fidel Castro, is he alive?  Is he dead?  Now they're starting to say he is alive, but...  Yeah, but no one's seen him.  But he's dying of old age, they're trying to say now.  He's an older gentleman.  What's he in?  He's close to 80, right?  I think he is.  He's 80, yeah.  80 years old.  80 years young.  80 years young.  That's what I say, Jimmy. 
[01:57:00]  God bless 80 more.  Yeah, really?  Like Hugh Hefner.  He's 80 years old.  But at least Fidel looks old.  He's not trying to have sex with 18-year-olds and pretend they like him.  Some playboy, Bonnie, said about Hugh Hefner to somebody that his skin hangs down over you  when you're in bed with him.  You have to.  What are you going to do?  Say no?  I mean, he's Hef.  After the roast, I saw Rob Schneider wheel out with one of the Hef girls, and they fired  her.  Good.  Like, on the spot.  Well, that was when he had seven girlfriends or whatever it was, right? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, like a bunch of them, yeah.  So.  And that was it.  Like, she went for Rob Schneider because she was so in love with Hef.  Yeah.  And she threw out a career with Playboy for, like, that guy.  Yeah.  Come on.  It's like it's Jim Carrey or a guy that does great multi-million dollar films.  It's crap.  Deuce Bigelow.  Maybe you get the part three.  Stupid.  Good move.  Maybe you can introduce Eddie Griffin.  He's good.  Who?  All right.  Anyway, we got a new CD we got to promote here, huh? 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  If you say so.  Revelations?  That's correct.  That's correct.  Coming out first week of September, some rock music for the children to enjoy.  Right.  The latest CD from Audioslave.  Do we have that?  Yeah, we got it.  We got the single, anyway, that we can play a little later.  I want a coffee ticket.  So what can you tell us about the CD?  Well, we made the CD with producer Brendan O'Brien, who did the Rage Records, Evil Empire,  and Battle of Los Angeles.  Evil Empire.  Nice.  Yeah.  We came off a tour, and we're playing better shows than we had ever played before, 
[01:58:30]  and went straight into the studio to make some rock jams for the people.  Is Zach jealous at this point?  You'd have to interview him.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  There's a problem there.  No talking to him anymore?  No.  Actually, I hadn't seen him in years.  I ran into him the other day, or a couple months ago.  Was it Sybil?  Yeah.  Very good.  Very good.  Very good.  Well, he's doing his thing, right?  Yeah.  He's been.  Sneaking guns to somebody somewhere, I'm sure.  Wow.  I believe it actually reads that on his business.  Right. 
[01:59:00]  Man, he believed in some things.  Unbelievable.  How did you feel about Sabbath being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  You must have loved that, right?  Long overdue.  Thank you.  Yeah, long overdue.  Sabbath or Zeppelin?  Coin flip.  All right.  That's fair.  Wow.  That's the first time we've heard that answer.  Yeah.  We've heard every answer except that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big Sabbath fan.  A lot of musicians.  Yeah, of course.  Well, a lot of musicians would say Zeppelin.  You know, it's fine.  I'm going to argue with him over music.  Well, you know, definitely you're Zeppelin.  You cannot argue with the Zeppelin call. 
[01:59:30]  But there's something in the Black Sabbath that, you know, if you come from sort of working  class, heavy metal neighborhood, there's nothing that quite scratches the itch like that Black Sabbath.  Yeah, they're kind of the underdogs when it comes to Zeppelin.  Zeppelin was kind of like the rich kid, and Sabbath was kind of like the broke nobody  with dirty shoes.  That's probably not the best description of the band.  That was a flavorful analogy.  You think Kiss should be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? 
[02:00:00]  Of course they should.  You think?  Of course they should.  There shouldn't be politics with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Why wouldn't Kiss be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Because I heard Ronnie talking on Ron and Fez, and Ronnie brought up a great point.  He goes, you let Kiss in, you're going to have to let in the Archies.  The genius that is Ron Bennington.  Yeah, sure.  It's hysterical.  He goes, and he starts naming a bunch of other bands that are kind of, you know, bubble gummy  or creeper, like the Monkees would have to be let in and things like that. 
[02:00:30]  I kind of agree with him.  The Monkees neither spitfire nor sold 100 million records.  Well, 100 million records?  Yeah, I think.  100 million records.  Let's say hi to Mikey in Georgia.  Mikey, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to ask Tom about a lot of his stuff sounds like he was influenced  by Buckethead or he influenced Buckethead.  Want to know, Mike, his comments on that?  I'm familiar with Buckethead, but I wouldn't really count him as one of my influences.  But he's a good dude, and I like his angle. 
[02:01:00]  I like the bucket on that head and the little rain slicker.  And the fact that he plays a million notes per minute, that's some good shit.  Of course, you're talking about the guy that played with Axl for like a day.  It seemed like he was supposed to be his new guy, and that lasted just, I don't know,  a few shows, and that was it for Buckethead.  But he's been around for many, many years.  He's been around for a while.  And most musicians know all about him.  Yeah.  All right.  So you guys, musicians, are kind of lucky, man, because you get to occasionally jam with  guys that you idolize.  That's true. 
[02:01:30]  I mean, comics don't get to go on stage normally with guys we love.  Yeah.  You know, and put them all jam together.  Yeah, just two guys riffing, you know, one awkward.  It would be really awkward.  I was going to say, can I smash the watermelon tonight?  Come on, Gallagher.  Come on, give me the mallet.  Great comics.  Well, that's why I went there.  Of course.  So who did you ever jam with that you were dying to?  I got to do a song with Jimmy Page.  I got to play with Joe Strummer, who was my all-time hero.  Is that?  From The Clash.  Okay.  From The Clash, yeah.  Those would probably be the two biggest highlights. 
[02:02:00]  And then a lot of other people, you know, from Flea to, you know, Stephen Perkins to a lot  of people who have been fans.  Were you, like, nervous playing in front of one of your heroes?  Like, I better not suck.  Yes.  Like, I hope my fingers just don't like it.  Yeah, the Joe Strummer one was very nerve-wracking because he was, like, my number one guy growing  up.  And you're sitting there like, oh, my God, that's Joe Strummer.  That's Joe Strummer, yeah.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Mike.  Hey, Mike, what do you got?  Yeah, I just want to ask Tom a question.  You know, with Rage and with you guys going to Cuba with Audioslave, I see a lot of socialist 
[02:02:30]  symbolism with red stars and stuff in your lyrics.  What's the deal?  What are you guys' views?  I mean, are you guys into socialism?  Because, I mean, that's what I get from things I've seen and heard from you guys.  What's your actual political view?  Well, I mean, Audioslave is not a band that's, like, explicitly political, though we did go  to Cuba and it was pretty amazing.  And both the people and the time we had there was really surprising to us in a lot of ways. 
[02:03:00]  And just the tremendous sort of generosity of spirit and the awesome, you know, the influence  on sort of culture and education and health and things like that.  Something took us all completely by surprise.  We had an amazing time there.  And, you know, it's a place that I hope more people are able to go to check it out to see  the things about it that are different that you might not expect.  What I got out of the DVD, although they're very poor, they seem very happy.  Yeah, yeah.  Which was really strange to me.  It's very, like, proud and very, you know, it is very poor, but it's, you know, in a lot 
[02:03:30]  of, it's, it's, there's things that are very surprising, you know, like the fact that the  literacy rate is higher than it is in the United States.  You know, it's like, that's something that you wouldn't expect, but that's true.  You, um, do you ever get, like, when you're in a band, I mean, I know you got something  like, like, Merciful Fate, they said King Diamond, right, and Satanic Lyrics, people,  like, the band got tired of that after a while.  When you're doing political stuff, like, in Rage, does that get tiring after a while?  There's, like, one guy in the band that's like, all right, can we go in another direction?  Like, is it happening?  No, it never got, it never got tiring.  Can we write a song about girls?  Please?  Well, I mean, like, you have conflicting views in, like, politics, like, what happens? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, well, that was never really that much of a, that was, I mean, Rage Against the  Machine didn't agree about much, but we agreed about the political stuff, you know, for  the most part.  And just, like, you know, there's a million bands out there writing songs about cars and girls,  and there was, you know, basically one or two bands who were, you know, on the charts  writing songs about political stuff, so, you know, I think there were still a lot more songs  to write.  But P. Diddy's done a lot for voting, too, if you remember the campaign a few years  ago.  Oh, of course.  Some people write about girls, other people write about, you know, shooting shoppers with 
[02:04:30]  shotguns.  What was that?  On Rodeo Drive.  Rodeo Drive.  Have you been down Rodeo Drive lately?  Well, a couple of years ago.  Did a little shopping myself.  It's wonderful.  I never shopped there.  I really did want to just drive up on the sidewalk, though, and hit people.  Let's say hi to Ernie in Brooklyn.  Ernie.  I did to my friend last night, and I like doing this.  I just go on a Rodeo Drive and go, all right, how much is that?  And then when they tell me, I just go, I can't afford it!  And I walk out.  Oh, that'll get him.  That gets him laughing.  Ernie.  Side down, sunglasses on, and talk into a banana. 
[02:05:00]  What's up, Ernie?  Good morning.  This is Ernie from Brooklyn.  How are you guys?  Hi.  Good morning.  Let's go, let's go, Ernie.  We only have a couple minutes left here.  I just want to say, I'm a new listener.  I just started listening to you guys, and I love the show.  I'm very happy you guys are here.  But you made a comment about Tiff.  Yeah.  And you included them with the Archies and the Monkeys.  Right.  And I think that's ridiculous to say something like that.  Well, I said that, and my name is Ron Bennington.  I'm with the Ron and Fez show, and you could catch me on XM. 
[02:05:30]  That's right.  At noon, and bitch at me about that.  Okay, but you've got to admit that Kiss deserves to be in the Rock of Low Hall.  Yes, sir, but when you look at it like that, you have to start thinking.  They're like ABBA.  Exactly.  I love Kiss, too.  I just like to say, I agree with the caller on that one.  Of course.  I do, too.  He annoys me in his calling.  Guys, all kidding aside, shut up.  Let's go to Jimmy in Jersey.  Jimmy.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Tom, I'm a big fan, man. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you.  I actually heard the other day that Chris Cornell was going to be leaving Audio Slave and pursuing  some solo stuff.  No, Chris is doing some solo stuff, but he's not leaving Audio Slave, to the best of my  knowledge.  All right.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right.  Well, they got a new CD out, so, I mean, it's not going anywhere anytime soon.  Yeah, I mean, we've made three CDs in four years.  If you count the Cuba one, it's four CDs in about four and a half years.  So, you know, we're much more prolific than we ever were with Rage Against the Machines.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Love the show.  All right.  Hey, I was going to tell everybody, Tom is the coolest guy to his fans.  I saw him in LAX one time.  Just went up to him and said, hey, Tom, love you.  Saw Rage a couple times.  And I asked him for his autograph, being, you know, a weirdo.  But I lost him.  I went back into the food court and he waved me down.  He, like, waved to me to come over so he could give me his autograph.  Cool.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  And I do it for the kids.  You really do seem very down to earth, Tom, I got to say. 
[02:07:00]  I'm even more down to earth than 8 in the morning.  When was the last time you asked for an autograph or a picture from a celebrity, and who was it?  It might have been Bruce Springsteen about six years ago, something like that.  We at Rage had actually covered a Bruce Springsteen song, Goes to Tom Joad.  And I saw him backstage at one of his shows, and I asked him to sign a set list for me.  He said, thanks for doing my song.  And he did it?  Pretty exciting, yeah.  Yeah, he did it.  He didn't say get away from me?  No, not at all. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Let's go to Reggie.  Reggie, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, I never got into rock and roll until I heard my first Rage record.  You know, I went out and picked up a guitar and everything.  Tom was a big influence on me, you know, picking up the guitar and everything.  I still play like crap, but...  You know, being a black guy and all, you know, I was at a party one time, and they put on, 
[02:08:00]  what was that record, they put on, what was on Parade, and, you know, that's the first  time I heard somebody play the guitar like that, and I went out, like, that week and  then picked up a guitar.  So, you know.  Right on.  Thanks, man.  Then what happened?  Yeah, do you have a question, Reggie?  Hurry up before your phone card runs out.  No, I just wanted to say thank you for everything, for the music, and just thank you for the  talent that you have.  Right on.  I appreciate it. 
[02:08:30]  Well, good luck with your guitar playing.  Thanks.  Cool.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Dave in Connecticut.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, yeah, I just want to say, you know, when this guy goes to Cuba, he's only seeing what  Castro shows him.  You know, the man...  That's not true.  That's not true.  Well-educated.  That's not true at all.  You don't know what you're talking about.  That's not true at all.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, that's not true.  Yeah, because I saw whatever I wanted.  I went everywhere I wanted, anytime I wanted, did anything I wanted for all the time that  I was there.  They just let you go on the island and you walked around and did exactly what you wanted. 
[02:09:00]  Yes, sir.  What you wanted, and the people, they weren't watching you at all.  If they were watching me, they were watching me go wherever I damn well pleased.  Dave, did you see the DVD?  No, I didn't.  So why don't you go see that, and then we'll then call back.  Well, you know, I mean, come on, Castro, you know, Castro's a tyrant, and he was, I'm  sure his people were keeping an eye on you, and the people had to act exactly how he wanted  them to act.  Uh-oh.  I'm sorry, my friend, but you haven't been there, and you don't know what you're talking  about.  You might want to pick up the DVD and then go from there. 
[02:09:30]  All right, well, I'll pick up another piece of media to see what they let someone from the  media...  Sir, you're being a speculative ass.  You're talking to somebody that was there.  My manager has been to Cuba, and to be very honest, he's kind of, he kind of said the  same things Tom did.  He's been there a couple of times.  I have the same feelings about Castro.  I don't like him, but, you know, people that have been there have said that there's a certain  vibe in the country.  What are you going to do, disagree with it because you read something?  Actually, he did go.  Him and Johnny Ola went down to some club.  Saw a sex show down there.  Yeah, I passed around a gold phone. 
[02:10:00]  We're bigger than U.S. steel.  With that, we're out of here, unfortunately.  They shut us off there, Tom, so we've got to get out of here.  We're going to continue on XM Satellite Radio.  We're going to do the walkover.  We're going to do the walkover live on XM.  And don't forget, Audio Slaves' highly anticipated album, Revelations, will be in store September  5th.  Thank you very much.  All right, thank you.  Tom Morello, everyone.  I love showing my introverted fat guys. 
[02:10:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Obi and Anthony XM 202.  The Obi and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Hey there.  Wow, that was, we just got down here.  I'm the only one that even has a microphone. 
[02:11:00]  Welcome to part of the Obi and Anthony show for this Whip them out Wednesday.  The XM portion.  Hi, people.  Hi.  There's some people out here.  There's nobody out here.  The other guys are still getting their equipment on.  No, we're not.  My equipment's on.  Oh, Jimmy's online, as they say, online.  And there goes Obi.  Oh, a fucking geezer butler's band.  Oh, yeah?  GZR. 
[02:11:30]  Fantastic.  Beautiful day here in New York City.  I know you people around the country don't give a shit, but it's a lot cooler.  A lot nicer out today, right?  Not as much humidity, right?  Yes.  Hi.  There you go.  I just talked to random people on the street, and they have to acknowledge me because I have  a microphone.  A lot cooler today.  A lot more comfortable, right?  Yeah, he nods.  See?  Very nice.  I hate a head of white hair on a younger man.  A shock of white hair.  They call it a shock.  A shock of white hair.  A shock of white hair.  You want to red it with an axe blade. 
[02:12:00]  Fucking pulp it up a bit.  Hey.  A lot nicer, a lot cooler today, right?  That's right.  I'm not dying, though.  That's my Chinese voice.  I'm not dying.  Hey, we got to talk to our new homeless friend.  Oh.  Oh, here he is.  Okay.  Let's give him a kiss.  Because our other one, we think, is dead.  Yeah, Mac is dead.  Maybe they thought she was dead.  Thank you, ma'am.  God bless you.  Hello, mister.  How are you?  How are you doing, sir?  All right.  How are you?  Here's two singles for you.  All right.  How's it going for you today?  All right.  Remember us?  Yeah, I remember you all. 
[02:12:30]  What's your name again?  My name is Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Where do you spend your nights?  I sleep on the church, 55th Street.  Oh, right.  I've seen a few people sleep around that church.  That's where I sleep.  Yeah?  Not inside, though, right?  No.  Outside.  Yeah, of course not.  They don't want to mess up the church.  Just in the vestibule.  On the sidewalk.  Let's not go against everything that religion is all about.  Just be able to go in the church.  Lock the church doors.  We don't want the homeless inside messing it up.  No, it's not that they're pretty nice to us. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah?  They have to be.  They give you food and stuff?  Yeah.  We get a lot of food there.  And you guys sleep on the stairs, right?  On the stairs.  Right.  And someone gets the top stair, and then someone gets...  The cops cannot bother us, because they had a case with the city, and they won the case,  so we are allowed to sleep there.  Oh, the church fought to let you guys stay there?  Yeah, we are allowed to sleep there.  So, are there any fights over who gets the stairs?  No, not really, no.  Everybody's all right.  Yeah, pretty cool about it?  Yeah, everybody's quiet. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, I guess the troublemakers stay away from the church.  Not troublemakers, no.  That's good.  They don't want to get kicked out.  Yeah.  Hey, where'd you get the real nice Nike hat?  Yeah.  Oh, I got this from Salvation Army.  Really?  Salvation Army.  You don't look that homeless.  You look barely homeless.  Yeah, we got to dirty you up a little bit.  Like you just fell into it.  We got to give you, like, a homeless makeover.  You'll make a lot more money.  You got to still keep yourself clean, you know?  You shouldn't keep yourself clean.  You'll get a lot more money.  Nah.  Well, maybe it works the other way where people really think he's... 
[02:14:00]  You know, when people give you money, he's going to turn himself around.  Yeah.  Where do you shower and stuff like that?  You look like you shower.  No, I go down 80th Street on Broadway.  Yeah?  There's a shower there?  Yeah.  80th or 18th?  80th.  The pool, the pond.  Where's the shower?  Cool.  It's a church.  The church lets you shower?  The church is, uh, all right.  I get to Friday.  Oh, very cool.  And look, he's got, like, a duffel bag and a newspaper, so you're kind of reading up on  things.  Yeah, of course, you know.  So you're barely homeless. 
[02:14:30]  Well, I told you that we are homeless, but we are not hopeless, you know?  Right.  Homeless, but not hopeless, Opie.  My question is, where do you shit?  Because I'm so awful.  When I have to shit, I can't shit anywhere but home.  Oh, you must have a problem, like, because a lot of establishments, they want you to buy  something before you use their bathroom.  You know, we get toiletries.  We got our church people, they gave us toiletries.  Boy, that church, really hooking you guys up.  They certainly are.  I think it's just like the people that are a little crazy in the head that are, you know,  wearing the big snorkel jackets in the summer and all dirty. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, well, you know, everybody's different.  You know, some people are mentally sick.  Some people are due to circumstances.  You know, it all depends.  So you're trying to slap your life together, get back and get a job again.  Yeah, I'm trying my best, you know.  Yeah?  Are you getting closer every day to...  Yeah, sometimes I do...  If I get a job, I get a temporary job a day, a year, a day, there, like...  Yeah, earn a little money, get yourself some...  I don't come here every day, you know.  When I'm really, really broke, that's when I come, you know.  Do you bang any homeless girls? 
[02:15:30]  Pardon?  Do you have sex with any homeless girls?  No, sir.  I'm not into that, sir.  No?  Sex?  No, if you go with a homeless girl, what are you going to do?  You're going to go still down.  That's true.  Ah, wow.  You're like chicks with apartments.  I don't blame you.  No, no, I don't, you know.  I'm just...  No, I don't even think about it.  I ate a girl's ass on a camping trip once.  I'll never go back.  You don't think about sex at all?  No.  Why?  Try to keep it out of his head.  I got so many problems that I cannot even think about it.  I've got to worry about my life first. 
[02:16:00]  Well, what do you do when you get a boner?  Women, right?  What are you going to do?  What do you do when you get a boner?  What?  You get, you know, this.  Ah, come on, man.  But what do you do?  Because, you know, you are human and those things pop up.  I'm not human, but life is all about control, you know?  You control your boners?  Everything you've got to control.  Man in life, you've got to control everything.  How do you not control the rent?  Yeah, that's...  You can control his boner, but just not his paycheck.  You seem like a pretty rational, logical guy.  Yeah.  Why don't you have an apartment?  Do you drink too much or do drugs? 
[02:16:30]  I don't drink at all.  I don't drink at all.  I don't do drugs.  I told you I was, like, with my family and I had a problem, so I had to...  Right.  But now, I forgot, why are you staying in New York instead of going somewhere that's really  inexpensive to...  New York is more easier if you're homeless.  You can manage...  But, I mean, you could probably move somewhere where you could get a pretty good labor job,  where then you can get an apartment, or...  Yeah, it's not easy.  You know, if you don't have no papers, it's very hard to get a job.  Oh, papers.  Right.  That's right.  I forgot.  You came over and maybe you don't have everything you need.  Yeah, I see. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I see.  And especially now, since they're having the immigration thing, it's very, very hard to  get a job.  Yeah.  You're not Al-Qaeda or nothing, right?  No.  No.  Why did we skip over the boner thing?  If you want to talk more about his boner, you feel free.  But what happens when you have the wet dreams?  You've got to get the poison.  Come on, man.  You've got to get the poison out.  I'm curious about this.  Ain't no poison.  Nothing is poison, man.  Is it your religion or something?  It's probably part of it, I bet.  You control it through religion and spirituality? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I just don't even think about it.  All right.  Wow.  How much do you pull in on a day sitting here, would you say?  It depends.  Sometimes 15, sometimes 20, sometimes 5.  It depends.  That's it?  Yeah.  And what are you?  It gets your food for the night?  I get food for the night.  I buy my clothes sometimes.  Yeah, sometimes you get another shirt or something like that.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  What do you miss the most about living in a place besides, like, the roof?  Oh, you know, you don't get enough sleep and all, you know.  Yeah, always getting woken up on the street like that. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, you've got to wake up and at night there's so much traffic and things like that.  You can't really sleep on the street.  You have to keep your one eye open, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, you've got to watch out.  We've got to watch out.  You ever get kicked or any of that crap?  No, not on church steps, no.  All right, good.  No.  We have a security there.  They watch us, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where are you going to go when it gets cold?  Well, then, you know, what do you call it?  We go to the Bowery Mission downtown.  That must be rough, though, huh?  No, they open the chapel at night for the people to come there. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey.  It's like, no.  Well, God bless.  Bless you all.  And good luck.  Good luck to you.  There you go, sir.  We'll be getting a little pinched spot.  Have a good day.  All right.  There we go.  Our new homeless friend.  He had morning breath.  It was bothering me.  Morning breath.  I'm obsessed with the boner things.  There's something going on there.  Are you saying it like morning, like the dead?  M-O-U.  Yeah.  Whoa.  What do you think is going on with the boners? 
[02:19:00]  He's put it out of his mind.  But I think it's still in his mind, but he's just got a kind of, you know, he's got enough  problems.  You start trying to let your boner talk for you when you're homeless.  It's called being a rapist.  He probably fucks a piece of chewed gum on the sidewalk.  Yeah, why not?  What can you do?  Who doesn't?  I like to fuck a cigarette butt.  That's good because I got no papers.  Let's do homeless experiments.  Next time he's here, let's get hot girls and see if he can even get a boner.  All right.  Let's all just chuck off on them. 
[02:19:30]  Some strippers or something.  All right.  Let's cross here.  There you go.  You look like a bunch of perps.  These guys are going to go crush some skull somewhere.  They're undercover and ready for action.  Yeah.  They don't look like cops either.  They're on subway patrol, I bet.  No, those are undercover guys.  What are they doing?  What are they doing?  Why don't we ask one of our experts, right?  What are they doing?  Anything they want.  I hear what you said.  Anything.  Anything they want. 
[02:20:00]  What do you think those cops are doing?  Those guys are undercover in the back, right?  Yeah.  Subway?  No, they're probably going to do peddlers.  Oh, yeah?  Peddlers?  Peddlers.  So, you know, the guy's selling the watches and the popcorn.  Peddlers.  I picture a wooden cart with fruit on it.  And the undercover guys are good, man.  Hi, welcome to New York.  It's a radio show.  How you doing?  But we videotape it, too.  But we don't show it anywhere. 
[02:20:30]  There's not even a tape in it.  He's an idiot.  Black or white?  What do you think?  We're trying to figure it out.  His hair.  But then the skin.  We like them.  Where are you from?  Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania?  Yeah.  Just come to the city for the day?  Yes.  Yeah.  What did you see so far?  Nothing, really.  Yeah?  You're going to...  Okay, well, we saw Rockefeller Center and...  Oh, okay.  You see, uh...  Pazza Hotel.  Central Park.  Where are you going? 
[02:21:00]  Empire State Building?  Yeah, we're at the top.  Is that the big finale?  Go to the top?  Well, actually, we're going to come up here and eat at Jekyll and Hyde's for dinner.  That's fun for the kids.  You'll like it.  Yeah, tell them what happened to you at Jekyll and Hyde's.  They stole my credit card number and rang up a bunch of cell phone charges.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But they got rid of the riffraff in there.  Yeah, it's fun.  Check out all the rooms.  There's a bunch of little fun things to do in there.  That's what we want to do.  She's been here before, so...  Yeah.  It's like the Adventurers Club at Disney.  You ever been there?  Yeah, it's fun.  You look like a Disney family.  You are an all-American family, man. 
[02:21:30]  Thanks.  That's great.  Refreshing to see in this day and age.  Just say it.  It's glad to have white people in New York.  Just say it.  Take care, people.  All right.  Okay, Jim.  Refreshing.  You've got me.  All-American.  I said refreshing and all-American when all I did mean was white.  Of course.  What color would you like the bathroom painted?  Refreshing all-American?  Got it covered.  How you doing, old? 
[02:22:00]  What's up?  How are you?  Stickers.  Oh.  Do we have wow stickers today?  We have wow stickers.  We got them somewhere.  What are you late for, miss?  Obviously, not a workout.  Maybe if you cut back on breakfast.  This guy needs wow stickers.  She's six years late for the gym.  I've been listening since WNEW, Dave.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I'm 55.  I'm out of your demographic, but you guys are great.  No, you're not.  No, not at all.  You kind of look like Chef from Apocalypse Now.  There you go.  That's right.  After he was decapitated.  So see.  Yeah, we'll give him some wow stickers there. 
[02:22:30]  Run.  All right.  We're almost at XM.  Almost.  It's a very interesting walk.  We've gotten to talk to some people.  I'll say.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Look at this guy.  Marcellus Wallace.  Yes.  Holy shit.  He's got fat, Wendley Snipes.  Wow.  That guy's scary.  What are you guys looking for?  Maybe we can help you.  Yeah.  What do you need?  Huh?  Central Park?  Oh.  Where are you from?  Where are you from? 
[02:23:00]  Say it.  Left at the corner.  It just goes straight when you hit it.  It's right there.  Yeah.  You hear you're about a block and a half way.  You see a lot of trees.  It's really.  If you go around the corner, you'll see it.  Go now to the corner and make the left.  It's literally right there.  Where are you guys from?  Where are you from?  San Antonio, Texas.  Texas.  Nice.  What are you going to do in the park?  Try to buy some weed?  I know.  Going to go for a jog.  Yeah.  Quite the opposite, but you know.  Yeah.  He told you, Opie.  Yeah, he sure did.  Smart ass.  Is that your pal there?  My brother. 
[02:23:30]  What's up?  His brother.  All right.  Wait, parents at the hotel or are you runaways?  Yeah, parents at the hotel.  Yeah.  They're sleeping.  They're going to get coffee earlier.  Do they tell you, be careful in the park?  There's people that are scary in there.  No, we're going with a pretty big group, so.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah, good.  Do some wilding.  You know what that is?  It's fun.  He's bored.  All right.  If you go to this corner, just look.  Yeah, just take a laugh.  You can't miss the point.  I swear to God.  Just take a laugh at the light.  All right.  Have a good time in the park. 
[02:24:00]  Take it easy, Texas.  More cowbell.  Yeah.  Good t-shirt.  That's funny.  Opie goes, he's bored.  He was.  I don't blame him.  Kids with their iPods.  That's right.  They're iPods and they're Jewish friends.  Jimmy's very entertaining.  Thank you.  You're fun to walk with.  Ladies, the heat wave seems to have broken.  Oh, wow.  Apparently the cunt wave hasn't. 
[02:24:30]  Boy, they didn't like you.  They certainly didn't.  They didn't acknowledge you at all.  And it hurts.  Opie.  What happened?  Look at those glasses.  As big as your head.  The kid that just got out of the military once.  It's not a quick.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go.  Oh.  Ready?  Come on.  Military always.  Yeah.  Al-Qaeda.  No.  Teasing, of course.  We'll all get in here.  Come on now.  You two.  Stand in front a little bit. 
[02:25:00]  Stand next to Opie a little bit.  There we go.  Squeeze it.  Let's go.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks for all you, sir.  See you later.  All right, everybody.  Take it easy.  We're done.  God bless.  God bless.  Hey, sis.  And if that's the Archies.  Oh, when that's how I'm tracking up.  The Archies.  All right.  See you upstairs.  Go on.  Massacus.  That sucks. 
[02:25:30]  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens all resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:26:00]  El virus.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:26:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All righty. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's time for music on Owen Day. 
[02:27:30]  A piano's been brought in.  And there is Fan sitting next to it.  With his big head and stupid ass grin.  We say, fan, can you play us a melody?  We're all pretty sure it will blow. 
[02:28:00]  Cause we think you're a schmuck, so we know it will suck.  Just like all of Jim Norton, you're the own.  How are we gonna hold?  Just like all of Jim Norton's hoes.  Than, ta-ta-та-tan, ta-ta-tan.  Ha-ha.  Ta-ta-ta-ta-tan, ta-ta-ta-fan.  There's a fan.  Play us a song, you're the piano fan  Play us a song today  No one here thinks you can't hold a melody 
[02:28:30]  And if you can, we'll call you gay  Dave from New Jersey, yes, we have not forgotten, fan.  Where are we at with you playing the piano?  We should have gotten that done by now, we should have had a keyboard in here  Well, we got something in here, but it's...  What is that, from 1980?  I think it has a drum pad on it  I'll bring in my own, because I've really... 
[02:29:00]  It only has 60 keys  It's sitting there, though  We can still hear you a little bit, though  You know, it's not your greatest, you can still, like, if someone doesn't have a great microphone, you can still hear if they can sing or not  You can't tease us like this  What do you need, 88 keys?  We have found that you're really, really good  And it's just sitting there  How about a little tease for tomorrow, Oop?  Let's hear a little bit  Just a little  A couple minutes  Doesn't have to be great  A couple of minutes  We know it's not a good, uh...  But the equipment  He's gonna blame it on the equipment  That's fine, you gotta pass on the first one 
[02:29:30]  Give us a little taste  That's the tease  You give us a little taste, and then you go, wow, more than playing the piano tomorrow  That's right  Where'd Vosco?  How do we set that thing up?  Yeah, I don't know  Yeah, I don't know  You put the hamster in the wheel  Where did we get that?  Let him run  Danny's  This is Danny's?  Yeah, come on  Ew, wait a minute, Danny  That means there's gonna be booze in the keys  Oh, yeah  Why is this yours?  Are you musical?  It's not...  Do you play?  No, it's not mine 
[02:30:00]  It was sitting in a friend's basement  Oh, okay  Of course it was  Traded it for liquor  Do you know how to play it?  Now you broke it  Stupid Eric  Why did he break it by pushing a button?  There's no...  What is it, battery powered?  Yeah, and I just tested it  How many batteries power that thing?  Eric touches it and it doesn't work anymore  30 car batteries?  What'd you do?  Yeah, pass it on me  No, it worked five minutes ago, Eric  Oh, well  Yeah, the battery's probably like  Oh, well  Were they brand new batteries in there?  Not brand new, but they were  How many does it take? 
[02:30:30]  You know what happened?  It worked five minutes ago  And in that five minutes, the batteries died  I'll get more  There it goes  Yeah  And then out again  And then out because  Alright, go get some batteries  We got a keyboard  Now I want to hear  I want to hear Danny play now  Yeah  Yeah, that's it  Danny goes first  Everyone is suggesting  Send Thane to Steinway  I don't think they're going to  Allow us to do that, unfortunately  Vos isn't here anymore  He's going to Kansas City  He's performing tonight  Oh, okay  He didn't even get a plug-in 
[02:31:00]  He was there  I'm guessing Stanford and Sons  So we'll find out  Where Vos is playing  If you're listening to us  In Kansas City  Travis in Iowa  What's up?  Yeah, I love the show  I love how honest you guys are  All the time  And I wanted to ask Jimmy  Why?  And not be funny about it  Why don't you really think  Kiss should be in the Hall of Fame  I do think they should be  I was just fucking  I thought the Ron Bennington line  Was very funny  Oh, okay, okay  I would say this 
[02:31:30]  Dude, I adored Kiss growing up  And I still love Kiss  But when you look at them  Musically or lyrically  Next to, I don't know  You say Zeppelin  Or a lot of the bands  That are in  They're not as good  And that's not to not kiss  They're just not as good  Musically as a lot of bands  Or lyrically or in any way  However, I think there's a lot of bands  That are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  That don't deserve to be there  I think Kiss should be there  Above a lot of them  So I would vote yes  Okay, and like you said  You know, if they let in  Then you gotta let all these  Other shitty bands in  But Kiss still deserves 
[02:32:00]  Like the Archies  Yeah, Kiss deserves  To be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Yeah, I agree with that  Sure  They're taking themselves  Way too seriously  Obviously Black Sabbath  Should have been in  A long time ago  What is it?  See, I have no idea  What the criteria is  To even get in  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  I think they're just  Trying to create  Controversy  To get people talking  About their stupid Hall of Fame  We went to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  When we were in Cleveland  It stinks  Yeah, I didn't even go  It's awful  Couldn't be bothered  They can't get real stuff  They got  They got stuff  Hendrix wore maybe once 
[02:32:30]  Because everything's at  Hard Rocks all around the world  Yeah, while he was jogging once  And it was in an attic  For many, many years  It's  Who cares crap  In the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  They really got  Help  Yeah  Help  You hanging up on me?  I'm just gonna try to hang up on you  All right  Well, I saw that coming a mile away  He goes  Hey, Ope  Yeah  And then you go  And he goes  Hey, Ope  Yeah, well  We got the batteries in there  Almost  All right, Danny's setting up the keyboard  I want to hear Danny play  How to pull him out of his dildo  I'm gonna say it out of his mom's dildo 
[02:33:00]  Ouch  Ouch  Those batteries smell like African  Oh my god  No, you play it the other way  Yeah  Cut it upside down  Oh, he's still putting the batteries in  How many batteries does that take, Dan?  All kidding aside  Six  Did you want to be a musician, Danny?  Me?  Yeah  All right  Oh, that sounds great  Let's hear what you can play  Me?  Yeah  Look at Jimmy  No, I've played for three years  Let's hear it 
[02:33:30]  So, Jimmy, play something  No  Play what you knew  Danny Cadden  Oh, from Big  Oh, you hear the song  I'm a douchebag  Wait  Can we, like, get this into the board  So we can get a nice sound?  Oh, is that all  Can we plug in or what?  Into the board?  Yeah, we gotta plug in  Now you're really asking for it  This is an XLR  Just put the mic down to  Yeah, no XLR jack on there  A real keyboard  You'd just be able to plug that mic jack in  Just put the mic down  Low by the speaker 
[02:34:00]  Jimmy, play something  Because you played for three years  Can we get it into the board or no?  Yeah, we're gonna mic it  All right  Danny, give us a little more  Do you know the theme from Arthur?  You drunk?  That's all I got  That's all you  You can play  For three years, you said  And is that all of that song that you know?  How long have you had a keyboard?  But it's not mine  I just screw around  I play guitar more than anything  Yeah?  Get a guitar  Get a guitar 
[02:34:30]  No, I don't play that  Yeah, we can go  We can jam up  You gotta give us a little something  I don't want  And the sound sucks, right?  It's not like a  What setting is the sound on?  Get a good piano sound  That was it  That's it  That's the piano sound  All right, so  We'll acknowledge right off the bat  That it's not the greatest piano  I know  What's it talking about?  But we'll still be able to hear talent  I don't know  Listen to this  It's got a drum little  Drum machine on it  All right  Don't be shy 
[02:35:00]  That's good  No good  Just close your eyes  No, I can't  Yes, you can't  He needs like volume pedals  Yeah, there's no sustained pedals  He's a virtuoso  Are you a virtuoso?  No  No  Come on  I'm virtuoso  It's about time  You were thrown under the bus  Give me that one  And I'll talk  You know what?  If you play something silly  Oh, sweetie  Then it goes with the silliness of that  Oh, okay  But there's just not enough keys  You can't fit those giant hands 
[02:35:30]  You do it  Oh, it's like a silent movie  That's silly  There's not enough keys?  No sustain  What was that you were just playing?  Maple Leaf Rag  Can you do that again?  I'm not even guessing  So, Valby has done that  Yeah, but he talks about pussy  And dirty cunts  No, no, no  But that might  Maple Leaf Rag  Is what they used to use  As a tampon back in the 1800s  Yes? 
[02:36:00]  That's fucking flying  All right  Get the hell out of here  That is  What?  Well, John Valby  The flying he did  Maybe he was just adding stuff to it  And being silly with it  Va-bon  Oh, boom  Wow  See, that wasn't an original  Can you play more of that piece?  Yeah, please.  It's really hard because I really get some keys. 
[02:36:30]  I understand there's only ten keys, but just give it a little bit more.  Can I get a copy of that?  I feel bad for Than.  The other problem is I don't...  Like girls?  Yeah, that's a big problem.  Like girls?  You know what I noticed?  He barely tried, and that came out like it was nothing.  I know.  Like it was nothing.  That's right.  I just want to go for the camera there.  No.  What, do you want me to play more Maple Leaf Rag?  Yeah, a little bit.  Or just something else that you could play on that piece of shit.  We understand it is a piece of shit that Danny brought in. 
[02:37:00]  I mean, I could really bring a better one tomorrow.  I know.  I know.  And you'll do it all, and we will hear it tomorrow.  All right.  Yeah.  You're not going to get a recording contract.  I haven't...  The problem is I haven't performed, so I don't have a lot of things memorized.  Right.  Because I just have it at home.  So bring in some notes for a while.  Do you read music?  Yes.  Oh.  Very much so.  Sorry.  Cool.  Sorry for even asking.  It goes very much so.  Yes, very much so.  Well, I...  You prop up the music sheet behind your honcho magazine? 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  It's getting counted.  See, I hate it because I really don't have enough keys.  I know.  You don't have enough keys.  You can see that you can play, though.  I mean, we can...  Yeah.  As much as I love the trash are you...  We should be back over...  Can you play the Hulk Walking Away music?  Ah!  I should know that, but I don't.  No, it's really fun listening to somebody try to figure out how something sounds. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I used to listen to my brother do that all the time on the guitar, and it was...  There it is.  Ah.  No.  So I'm close to that.  His hands are shaking.  Dan's never nervous.  He's really nervous.  I'm always nervous for the piano.  Hold on.  Are you?  Try it again.  No!  Oh.  See, wasn't that far away?  Wow, you got it.  Wow, you do that really well.  That sounds just like it. 
[02:38:30]  Now, let me ask...  And you're just figuring this out as you're going?  Yeah, I haven't done that before.  You, um...  And the sound of the piano got a lot better.  Can you play it as you're not...  How do you guys...  This is my problem.  As a pianist.  What do you do with your hands, Jim?  No, I...  Yeah.  How do you, like...  Like, if you're looking at it, I can see, but how the fuck do you know how far left or  how far right to go?  Like, because Vanity, I've watched...  He'll, like, look at the audience and just play.  How do you know how far...  He's been doing that for 30 years. 
[02:39:00]  It's called practicing.  Yeah, now he's doing it in his sleep at this point.  You just, like, you get to know where the relative positions are.  It's like anything else.  A guitar player, the same thing.  When you go up the fretboard, how do you know?  You know, you're not counting how many frets up you're going.  You just kind of know where your hand ends up.  It's the right spot.  That was Jim.  That's very good, Jimmy.  All right, one more thing.  Come on.  All right.  Give us something really good.  I really can't. 
[02:39:30]  Yes, you can.  He can't.  No, you don't understand.  I don't think he can.  Because half of it's going to be like this.  That's okay.  Because there's no key there.  That's a nice beat.  Yeah.  Do you know any Bach?  I'll bring him something.  Do you know any Bach?  He does.  See, not off the top of my head.  That's the problem.  No.  Let's play some Beethoven.  Lovely, lovely Ludwig van.  Ludwig van.  Yeah.  Trying to think of anything else I know.  Sorry, guys. 
[02:40:00]  That is dead air.  That is freaking out.  Yeah.  Come on, Van.  Thanks, Steve.  That was Steve.  He just took Van's hand and placed it gently on the keys.  Steve's going to break your finger so you can never play again.  Can you play Flight of the Bumblebee so it will remind Steve of when he's rifling for honey?  Does that off the top of my head?  That doesn't sound like...  Yeah, it does.  Play the thing. 
[02:40:30]  It's a lot faster with strings, but it's there.  Thanks, five.  How about...  Do you know Overshirt of the Sun?  No.  Why would you?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  But you got to taste.  I'll bring in my thing tomorrow.  He'll bring it in. 
[02:41:00]  The keys.  It'll be nice.  Don't blow us off.  We're not going to forget.  You can't be afraid, man.  There's no reason to be shy about it.  We know you can play.  You know what thing can play.  Yeah, so I won't be shy tomorrow.  um all right it's then everyone i uh that was uh you can't be if i would i would just jump on there  and bang out of tune without thinking about it without being afraid larry larry yes i just  can't find your dog dead in the hallway larry your mother that was fantastic just like everything  fan does fantastic couldn't agree more all right thank you all right well that was a big letdown

That's great  I'm good  Alright  Hey, getting right into some things here  Floyd Landis on Leno last night  He thought he was going to have a fun little interview  A cute little sit down with Leno  Calling him Roy Landis 
[02:46:00]  Well, he won the Tour de France  And they're saying he took something, he cheated  He tested positive  Yeah  And he's got all sorts of excuses  And at this point, no one's buying it whatsoever  So here's Floyd Landis on Leno last night  Okay, now what's going on?  Cause the test suggests cheating  You know, and I see you on these shows  And I do want to believe you  And evidence seems  I don't know if it's overwhelming  But it seems pretty conclusive 
[02:46:30]  Right?  If you go by the test, yes  Okay  But why should we not go by the test?  Tell me why  Well, I'll say that there's a couple possibilities of what may have happened  Okay  Bullshit  The test and the people doing the test would like you to believe that  The only possibility is that I intentionally took some drugs  And that's why the test is that way  Now, there's also the possibility in this argument that's been used by other people  And at this point, I don't know if it's the case that somehow or some way 
[02:47:00]  I ingested something that caused the test to be that way  Or there's some kind of natural occurrence  Goddamn liar  In my body that caused it to be that way  Or the fourth  And I'm beginning to wonder about this myself  After the way the  You're a liar  The situation's been handled  Is that after the urine leaves my hands  Most people probably haven't ever had a drug test like this  So they don't know how it works  But after I give them the sample, I don't know where it goes  Oh God, he's just babbling  Pardon my French 
[02:47:30]  But you're an asshole  He's trying to talk his way out of it, man  He goes, yeah, I don't know where it goes  Yeah  I piss in something  I hand it to some fucking frog  He throws some drugs in there  All of a sudden, American ain't winning  Hey, we hate the French, but come on  Yeah  I mean, come on  Take responsibility  You got caught  You got caught  And you don't seem dumb enough  To take this not knowing  No, no, what I mean is  I mean, what I mean is  You're a smart guy  You don't have to  Put him down, Jay  No, no, no 
[02:48:00]  I mean, you know how the game works  You know you're going to be tested  Well, yeah  I mean, so to take some  See, this is the part I think most people find confusing  I, too, find it confusing  But I haven't said it a whole lot  Because I don't know that it's an actual argument  But it seems odd  The synthetic testosterone  Now, you had that in your body  Where does that come from?  Well, here's another misconception  That's been perpetrated by the people  Who want to believe that this test  Doesn't make mistakes  This is also a ratio of natural substances  Just like the testosterone 
[02:48:30]  You lie!  The epitestosterone  You lie!  Testing questions  So there's two different tests  But both of them are ratios  Get out of here!  Get out of here!  Both of them have a cutoff  Where they say there must be another explanation  Even though they can't prove that it is  Oh, that was  You lie!  You're a fucking liar!  Shut up!  That was riveting TV  Jim, what do you think?  He stinks and I don't like him  Sorry you had to hear that  I thought there was more to it 
[02:49:00]  I'd like a web update, too  On the Buffalo situation  I'd love to know what's going on  Apparently  We took out the website  Yeah  The website has been  The pests have taken it out  Primary target destroyed  FixTheEdge.com is in deep trouble right now  How about the old MySpace account?  Well, that's part of the  Oh, and a daily dump report  Well, this is not the one that we  We didn't give this one out  Yeah, I know  But it's part of the dump report 
[02:49:30]  We weren't able to give out his MySpace address  No, I don't mean the guy  No, that's the pedophile MySpace  Oh, the other guy's MySpace  We were giving out a lot of MySpace accounts today  Could someone punch me in the face for that error?  Oh, error  No, really  I don't know  Colaring error  I read the dump report wrong  You're sweet  That's alright  There were three dumps today  654  Giving him shit for that  A caller  727 
[02:50:00]  MySpace website address for alleged pedophile  Dumped because during the segment  O&A were discussing 14 and 16 year olds  That are friends of his  And are linked to this MySpace address  So to protect them  And I slipped with fuck today  After spitting water all over the place  After something Jimmy said that was really funny  I whispered it after I spilled something in studio  He's really on the ball to catch that whisper  Because I heard it and was like  It was really low  It was really low  I just hope I didn't ruin the line 
[02:50:30]  But I don't think so  I think enough time went by  That the line still got out there  Gene Simmons on Family Jewels  Yeah, this is the latest show trying to  We get it  You're not married  But you've been with the same woman  For so many years  Yeah, we get it  I'm not buying that horse shit anymore  At first when he was coming around  You know, sounding all cool  Like he could get away with whatever he wants  Yeah  He's kind of buying into it  But I don't believe a word of it anymore  Maybe early on in his marriage  He was  Gimmick  He was still, you know  Getting a lot of poo-ha 
[02:51:00]  But after seeing the show  There's no way  No way  Gimmick  It's a gimmick, absolutely  My kids  Hey, Ash  Hi  What are you doing?  Alright, yeah  Here's the scripted show  Bad acting  Another show that's trying to duplicate  The success of the Osbournes  We're going to have Gene in, right?  This sucks  When?  Because we're going to have to  Call him out on this crap  Listen to this bad acting  This is Gene  When someone comes through the front door 
[02:51:30]  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house  How horrible is that acting?  But, um  No  Nothing's wrong  Just stay in the living room  I'll handle it  Talking to his wife  Not wife  Yeah  Let's, uh  Yeah  Let's set this up  Set this up by saying  Gene creates a logo for his son's band  Ah, okay  Listen to the, uh  The acting 
[02:52:00]  It's a reality show  Back there, Ralph  Hey  Hi  What are you doing?  Nick's forming his own band  So, you know  Eventually when you get your first record  You go out on tour  And I figured, like  By the time he gets up on stage  He'll have a logo  And a place to pick this  On, like, a t-shirt  What do you think?  Huh?  Did Nick ask you to do it for him?  No  Why are you doing it?  Well, um  Imagine if someone  Helped you do your band  Said, you should name it 
[02:52:30]  Guapo  And have a really big orange  In the background  Well, that's not a good idea  And you're already  Copyrighted  That I can see  Trademark, yes  Yes  Okay, you're right  I'll shut up  That's terrible  I'm sorry  Gene Simmons is a bore  Yeah  I'd love to hear more 
[02:53:00]  Gene offers his son Nick  Some advice on being in a band  That is far too advanced  Far too advanced?  Yeah, his advice  His son wants to start a stupid little band  And Gene's giving him this just over-the-top advice  Oh, okay  Way too advanced  Are you really serious about this, though?  Yeah  I've got a lot of advice for you  This is a tour bus  Looks cool  You will hate it  It's gonna smell like your butt unwiped 
[02:53:30]  This looks like a groupie  Don't talk to her  So, what are you gonna look like on stage?  Uh, the energetic front man  The energetic front man  Who's got the charisma  To make you want to go and buy the t-shirts  And the belt buckles  And the t-shirt  And the, yes  Uh-oh  Huh?  I hear music bed  Never good  No  Yeah, music bed means  Awful show  Yep  Music under there to  Well  Fill in the spaces 
[02:54:00]  Here's Shannon Tweed  Telling Gene to lay off a little  I just got some stuff for Nick  I see he's got the voice  And the style  And the whole thing  But he's really got a vibe  And I wanted to make sure  He's got the right clothes  And he should know that  Maybe you shouldn't coach him so much  Let me tell you something  He's gonna be a rock star  He wants to be a rock star  And I know how to be a rock star  Yeah  These are the best clips by the way 
[02:54:30]  Wow  Just to give you a taste  We'd like to preview these shows for you  So you don't have to watch them  Any more acting clips of Gene?  Because that wasn't that bad  Yeah, yeah  Like I understand when  Like he got really mad at Shannon  They had a big fight  Because like something about her bank account  Yeah, I heard hell of something like that  What happened?  But, um  I don't know  Let's listen in  Goddamn rich cunt  I kill rich cunt  Yeah  Apparently she was, um 
[02:55:00]  Spending too much money  Alright, Gene shows Nick  A banner he has made  Being trailed by an airplane  Above their house  Directly after Nick gets a voicemail  That his bandmate has quit  Why not?  Yeah, why not  Hey, Nick  What's going on?  I just don't think I have time for the band right now

Him  That's right, baby  Now you can see it  My son  He's out of his mind  I have to go  That's completely wrong  Do you think that's cool?  That's crazy  I've got a perfectly good pair of shoes with that, buddy  Oh, my good God 
[02:56:30]  I don't even  What does Steve think of this show?  Oh, I don't think he likes it  That's terrible, I'm sorry  Yeah, Steve  Oh, my God  Why not?  Why not?  I understand  Gene had to give his condolences to somebody  How'd your parents die?  Get the fuck out  Now  Grr, grr, grr 
[02:57:00]  Yeah  Oh, should we cut our losses?  Oh, no, please  A little bit more  Just one more  That show is horrible  No, just one more  Nick tells the band about their gig  Oh, no  Nick Simmons, of course  Gene tried to help by playing their instruments  Nick scolds his father, Gene  Does he?  Hey, guys  Here's the deal  My dad went a little crazy  And he set up a gig for us in two days 
[02:57:30]  What?  What?  In two days  In two days?  So, I think we can do it  We haven't even written any songs yet  Hey!  What are you doing?  Trying to get enough songs to play at the gig that you arranged for us in a few days  Before you even get up there, they're going to look at you  Dad, oh!  You've got to take this  You can't just sit there like a grandmother  Go!  Dad, oh!  Helping us is one thing 
[02:58:00]  Doing it for us is another thing  Dad!  Stop it!  Get out  Dad, I love you, but  Conviction  Conviction  I've been there, I've done that  We will have conviction  I know it  Just let us do it  We have a deadline  No, no  I will be listening  Get the fuck out  Now  That's crazy  Unbelievable  Jesus  I heard Steve in there 
[02:58:30]  I love when Steve pops up anywhere  Pops in  Telling Gene to get the fuck out of the studio  Why not  And finally  Why not  Yeah  And finally Gene and Nick have a talk to straighten things out  Because now there's a problem  Oh no  Oh no  Do they work it out?  I can't wait  Nick's gig goes well  And all is fine  So  Hiya  You know I mean well, right? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, but that was a lot  I know you're trying to help and stuff  But the band itself is having trouble  Like I don't see any community at all  You know  I'll take care of it  I'll play bass if you want me to  Or guitar  Is there any way to find a group of people my age?  I don't know a lot of 17 year old Muppets  I guess I just want a little time to try to get a bunch of guys together  No more banners  At least not until we've written a song  Okay?  Got a deal  Why not?  No  Nothing's wrong 
[02:59:30]  Just stay in the living room  I'll handle it  Fantastic  Wow  Why not?  Why not?  How did your parents die?  Stay here, I'll handle it  He is multifaceted, isn't he?  Yo, listen to this  It's the same delivery 
[03:00:00]  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  That's terrible  I'm sorry  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  That is the same delivery  Oh, why not?  And how'd your parents die?  Two polar opposites  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  You're a one trick sissy  Oh, is that great? 
[03:00:30]  It makes me happy.  You'll love him.  Say goodbye to this show.  We don't need to pay attention to that one.  Bye-bye, Gene.  That is awful.  The dude from the New York Post is here.  Oh!  Hi, sir.  Hi.  I see Flava Flava on the board.  Is he in or a phone?  A phone or tomorrow.  I want to know a little bit about this guy.  You want to come in?  He's not the normal guy.  No, he's like a freelancer. 
[03:01:00]  Freelance.  He's a freelance writer.  Hello, sir.  There he is.  How you doing?  Just want a little background info on you, sir.  Sure.  I know you'll be observing the show.  We're actually a little confused because I think we just did an article for the Post, didn't we?  Did we?  I don't know.  Didn't Minnelli write about us in the last, like, 30, 60 days or so?  Yeah, John usually writes, like, stuff for the Post.  What's the angle on this story?  This, just profile, man.  It's going to be in the Sunday Pulse section.  Next Sunday.  Just talking about the tour, talking about the traveling virus and, you know, what you 
[03:01:30]  guys are doing for comedy.  Yeah.  You know, there's some comedy tastemakers out there.  And where do you guys, where do you guys rank there?  Very nice.  Where do you get the nice voice from?  Do you do radio?  I used to, yeah.  Yeah, I can tell.  Yeah, he stepped right up to the mic, knows the deal.  Knew exactly how to work that mic.  Put his headphones on by himself.  Believe me, there were some retarded people.  Adjusted his volume.  Got all set.  Got it.  Sat on Opie's lap and worked the board. 
[03:02:00]  That was a little much.  All right.  Very cool.  Yeah.  As long as we know, you know, we just want to know if you're going to sit out there and  just start bashing us or something.  Yeah.  What have you written down so far?  That's always fun.  Well, I don't know what I can actually say FCC-wise, so there's no FCC here.  No, we're on satellite.  Go.  This is, okay.  It was a note on the call board.  It said, Opie, see girl, take shit on floor.  So I'm just making a note of that.  Oh, well, you want, all right.  It's actually under dreams and aspirations. 
[03:02:30]  Well, hell, you're producing the show.  That's fine.  Chris in New York, what's up?  Well, you guys had a busy weekend.  Please tell me that you had time to watch the premiere of The Flavor of Love.  I watched it last night.  Unbelievable.  Have you ever seen anything like that in your life?  I'm bummed they threw the one girl out already, though.  The one that shit on the rug?  No.  No, she's not out.  The one that looks like Patrice, she still is.  No, the one that took the dump on the rug, see, now we can say it over here, she's still 
[03:03:00]  in the house.  Now, why did she shit on the rug?  At the end of the show, you know, Flav has to decide who to kick out of the house.  And eventually there's one standing.  So they all gather in the hallway, whatever, at the bottom of the stairs, and he gives out  clocks.  And whoever doesn't have a clock has to leave, right?  So then after the girls leave, they all kind of get together in a little huddle.  They have a little champagne.  He spills some out for the girls that are gone.  It's a little ceremony they do. 
[03:03:30]  And then they go up to their rooms and continue living in the house.  Yeah.  Well, while they're doing that, and they capture it on film or on tape, one of the  girls, you see, she bends down and picks something up, and then she walks away and up the stairs  as they're still filming this ceremony thing.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, the next thing you know, everyone's like, what's that smell?  And it turns out the girl, I guess she wasn't wearing panties or whatever.  When she was standing there, she couldn't hold it anymore.  Maybe she thought she was going to fart. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, man.  Stop.  And she dropped.  She dropped more than one, you know, more than one.  And she picked it up.  She picked it up, yeah.  With her hands.  She picked up the evidence and ran upstairs with it.  But I guess that she was going upstairs, another one dropped because they're pointing  at the freaking floor going, oh, my God, oh, my God.  She shit.  And this was on VH1 last night.  I bet she was sick or something, and she thought she had like a little cough or something  and just.  Yeah, we have that.  I think we have the flavor of love.  Where is that?  I got to see the video clip of that. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  And VH1, you know, they show the reruns like every other hour.  So you got to DVR it.  I'm going to watch this one this year.  I didn't see the first year.  How do you top one of the girls shitting on the floor, though?  Well, what is the paper saying today?  They're saying it was the biggest premiere for a VH1 show ever.  For VH1.  What else do they got?  Here we go.  Premieres.  Flavor of Love 2 snared 3.3 million viewers last Sunday.  The top series premiere in VH1 history.  We Love the 80s, part three. 
[03:05:00]  3.3 is huge.  It's huge.  And the show started, they all go into the house, and then they have to run around and,  you know, pick a bed.  And Flavor Flav there decided it'd be funny to have one less bed.  So this white girl's jumping up and down on the bed, and she claims her bed.  And then I guess she went out of the room for a second to see what the other girls are doing.  And this ghetto chick comes running in and claims the bed.  The white girl comes back and says, no way, this is my bed. 
[03:05:30]  And there's an all-out brawl.  Just like the joint.  With a ghetto chick.  The black girl is just beating the crap out of the white girl, pulling her hair out.  White girl just total victim.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  The black girl just getting the best of her.  Those black people know how to fight.  Punching her to the back of the head and everything.  And this girl was hilarious, as ghetto as ghetto could be.  And they kick her out of the house.  I'm like, man, you guys don't know what good TV is.  Although the girls that are left are treats as well.  But you keep the girl in. 
[03:06:00]  But, Chris, yeah, I saw it.  It was great.  You should try and play the audio of the girl who got thrown out, the girl who had to fight.  It's hilarious.  You can't understand her half the time, but what you can hear is just absolutely hilarious.  You know what?  Why don't we do that?  All right.  Thanks, Chris.  Bye, boys.  Later.  Chris from Pennsylvania might have some good news for you, Anthony.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Ant.  If you go on YouTube under Flavor of Love, all the clips of the fight is on there and the 
[03:06:30]  clip of that girl shitting the floor.  I mean, they don't show her shitting, but there is a clip of the whole thing on YouTube.  Somebody's got it on PalTalk right now.  One of the people in the room has got it running on PalTalk.  Yeah, you might want to talk about PalTalk there.  Very interactive show.  You're on PalTalk right now.  That camera right there.  What's going on, Anthony?  Oh.  Where is it?  Right here.  See the little camera there?  There's another one up there.  And we get to watch all our listeners that are on PalTalk, and they get to watch us. 
[03:07:00]  See?  So they have cams at home, and you can see them?  Yeah.  So we're watching usually just the girls.  We're the most interactive radio show in America, sir.  There's a couple of our favorites that we pop up during the day, and they flash us during  the day.  Very nice.  It's very nice.  And they're carrying on conversations.  We get hundreds of people in these rooms.  They get to watch us and what we're doing.  So if we have something going on, interesting going on here in the studio, they not only get  to hear it, but see it.  And then if they want to show us something, like we had a guy that got his asshole stun 
[03:07:30]  gunned.  So we watched that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His wife put a stun gun right up his asshole and hit the trigger, and his head shot right  through the sheetrock.  Yeah.  No doubt.  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  We got to see it, and it was very funny.  Where's the dump on the rug?  Why are they showing the whole episode?  I think they're just showing the closing ceremony where they give away the clocks.  They got to fast forward a little bit.  Scott in Iowa.  Just let it roll.  We'll find it.  Scott.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey. 
[03:08:00]  I just want to know when that girl shit on the floor, did you run around in circles  saying, donkey sauce is, donkey sauce is?  Hey, and I also wanted to ask Jimmy something.  I've never heard you guys ask and talk about him or not, but I didn't know.  I didn't know if Jimmy ever worked with Rodney Carrington.  I know the name.  He's a comedian.  Why?  What about him?  Oh, I just didn't know if you ever worked with him.  That's the only reason I asked.  Why?  Because you're friends with him or something?  Never saw his act either.  I've just heard the name.  All right.  Oh, okay. 
[03:08:30]  Thank you, Scott.  Sam's in here.  He cut up the flavor of love.  You've got to get audio of the white chick that talks black.  Yeah, I was trying to work.  There's like 11 tracks on there, but I'll do that for tomorrow.  Well, could you do it?  Yeah, I can do it right now.  Yeah.  Because these guys got to hear this chick.  She's as white as could be, but she talks ghetto.  Wow, you're saying that there's some white person.  Sort of.  Yeah, but Sam doesn't.  Like our own Sam.  He doesn't.  Yeah, he does.  Whatever.  He's got the hair.  But if I play this audio, you would swear you're listening to a black girl and she's 
[03:09:00]  as white as could be.  I do like the fact that Sam amended it when you're like, Sam, can you get that?  He's like, yeah, I'll have it by tomorrow.  And you're like, well, why don't you?  He's like, I'll have it by tomorrow.  Go get it right now.  There you go.  Good boy, Sam.  He's fast forwarding a little bit to the, I guess, the shitting portion because I haven't  seen it.  Do you see her do it or?  You see her bending down.  Bending down.  Because no one knew she was going to take a shit.  Trying to pick up a log.  Good.  So it's not even a VH1 thing.  They're all just kind of hanging out in like a huddle. 
[03:09:30]  And all of a sudden, you know, after they smelled something and discovered what happened,  they played the tape back and you could see her in the background bending down and picking  it up.  Oh.  With her bare hands?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I guess.  And then she, you'll see.  When you dump on the road, you probably just don't mind picking it up just to get out  of there.  You got to get out of there.  Right.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Like now he's dipping the.  He's doing the champagne.  The champagne.  On the floor.  For the girls.  No, the girls have glasses of champagne.  All right.  Here they go.  The girls are now huddling around flavor. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Flavor of love.  Right.  Okay.  Now watch in the background so you can't hear the audio.  I'll explain what's going on.  They're all doing a cheers, right?  A little toast.  Now they're getting a toast.  Now watch this girl in the background.  What happened?  Which one?  All right.  Just let it play.  Let it play.  Okay.  Something smelled.  Yeah.  Flavor's like going something smelled.  We'll play the audio clips in a second.  But watch this.  What the hell is going on?  Which girl?  Are they fast forwarding through?  What are they doing? 
[03:10:30]  Stop fast forwarding.  Oh, wait.  Or maybe they're not.  No, maybe that was the setup.  All right.  Sorry.  Because you know how TV is.  They got to tease everything a million times.  Sorry I yelled at you, pal talk person.  Yeah.  Don't yell at him.  He's doing all the work for us today.  Yeah.  He could stop this at any second.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay.  Now.  I guess it was the setup where Flavor before commercials, you know, played the clip where  man, something stunk.  Something smelled.  Okay.  Watch this.  Another recap.  Now they go back. 
[03:11:00]  Which girl is it?  No.  Here it is.  They're doing it in slow-mo.  Watch.  All right.  He has to say something stinks again.  We get it.  Will you just play the clip now?  All right.  Watch this.  Okay.  In the back.  Right there.  All right there.  Okay.  She's bending down to pick up something.  She's bending down.  She's picking up something.  She's picking up her own shit.  She's picking up her own loss.  She looks around.  Making sure no one saw it.  Look.  Oh my God.  Guilty as shit.  She looks around.  And watch.  There she's walking away as they're still filming the shot.  Trying to hold it. 
[03:11:30]  Oh man.  Now she's going upstairs.  She's leaving the scene.  And there you go.  You see her walking upstairs.  You got to see this.  But she drops one?  She must have dropped another one.  On the stairs?  Not the one she had in her hand.  I think she just dropped again.  Another little nugget.  A milk dud fell out.  She dropped another deuce.  That's what we're thinking.  Because later on they start pointing around the bottom of the stairs.  Boy.  She's not going to live that one down.  No.  No.  That one doesn't brush off.  Look.  They're all laughing their asses off.  And now see right there.  She's looking down at another one that dropped. 
[03:12:00]  How did they not show them off?  Man.  Oh.  And they're just horrified.  They're all pointing at it.  I think she was just dropping logs all the way to the bathroom.  Because now at the top of the stairs.  She can't control her ass.  The girls are pointing at logs.  Oh no.  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  Is it racist to say she was shitting like a jungle bunny rabbit?  Hey man.  Yes it is.  Flav used gorilla.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He was saying gorilla.  We got something gorilla in the house. 
[03:12:30]  Maybe it's in this clip.  I don't know.  Alright.  Well here's the audio of the video we just watched on Pal Talk.  Whoever did that for us.  Thank you very much.  Here's Flav noticing a smell after the elimination ceremony.  After we do the toast.  I was like.  What is that?  Smell in my crib.  Yo.  Right now.  By the way.  Was that VH1 beeping or us?  Because we were preparing this for the first half of the show.  So bear with us.  But it was for both. 
[03:13:00]  He was basically saying what is that fucked up smell?  Well.  There might be a.  Sure VH1 wasn't going to play him saying fucked up.  Yeah.  No.  I understand that.  But there's another beep in here.  Because we were preparing it for the other side of the show.  Because we're not allowed to say duty or something.  Or poop.  Was it poop?  Isn't that amazing?  He dumped out a poop.  And we didn't have time to give you the uncensored version.  So bear with us today.  In my crib, y'all.  Right now.  I'm going to leave y'all for a little bit.  Then I seen this girl in the back. 
[03:13:30]  She kind of went out of frame for a minute.  But then she came back.  After we do the toast.  Something takes off upstairs.  Oh, my God.  That's a nasty.  I smell this.  Elimination is over.  I just want a sigh of relief.  So I take this deep breath.  And what is that smell?  That's the girl that talks like Tyson, by the way.  She has a real bad lisp.  Appropriate.  It's called elimination.  Everyone notices what the smell is here. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Watch your step.  I like to.  I like to.  Someone.  Oh.  Yeah, watch out.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  Watch out.  I think.  I was like, wait a minute.  I know we don't have no dogs in here.  But they're on my stairs.  Oh, no.  Hey, yo.  I'm like, where did this come from?  Something.  Something.  Something.  Something is on herself. 
[03:14:30]  And everyone's like.  Oh, is that disgusting?  It's hilarious, though.  How is he going to like.  Doesn't he have to interact with all the girls?  Yeah.  But they're smart because they'll keep her around for a while because that's that's good.  Oh, yeah.  If you got a shitter in the house, you got to keep her.  Well, they got this policy, though.  If you fight, you got to be kicked off a reality show.  And that sucks because the girl that fought is even better than this shit.  Did she come on or no?  Did she actually explain why she shit on the floor?  It might be here. 
[03:15:00]  So her name is something.  Something admits she's just she just had to go.  Hey, yo, something.  What up?  She opened up the bathroom door.  Something jumped out.  Oh, my God.  That smell was something.  So I think I really gave her the right name, folks.  Know what I'm saying?  Her name is something.  Yo, you all right in there, baby?  There's no way me holding it in.  I'm going to be honest.  I was like holding it.  And then out of nowhere, it's like my stomach was just like, bitch, you got me f***ing up. 
[03:15:30]  I have to go to the bathroom.  I like something because she's real with it.  She's like, yo, check this out.  Baby, this is who I am.  There's a wild gorilla running around loose in that bathroom.  That is karma.  She picked up everybody all night.  If y'all smell anything stink around here, it's me.  It's I'm the f***er.  So there you have it.  You got to see the show.  I didn't think they could duplicate what they did with the first season, but so far, so good. 
[03:16:00]  You want to hear the girls fighting?  This is within 10 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Of trying to get their rooms.  You got to listen to the ghetto girl and the white chick here.  And then after the fight, and I think we'll play the audio, the black girl, the ghetto girl,  she has to talk to Flav, and so does the other girl.  So they're going to figure out who did what, and then they're going to kick someone out.  Yeah.  So the black ghetto girl is like praying to God and begging God that she doesn't want to beat the white girl's ass or whatever. 
[03:16:30]  The clip is funny.  We'll play it here in a second.  But here's the actual fight.  I tell the girls to come up in the house, go find a bed.  All taken.  There wasn't enough beds for everybody, folks.  I was dead first.  Hey, hey, hey, don't touch my eyes on this bed first.  Hey, don't play.  You don't touch, you don't touch.  Oh, hell no.  Don't play.  Don't play.  Don't play.  Don't be mad or put your hands on me.  Don't they hit me with flowers?  Oh, hell no. 
[03:17:00]  Big, get a flower.  Get the flower.  Get off.  I go up in my room so that way I can get changed up and everything.  Oh, my God.  Get off of me.  Get off of me.  Next thing you know, I hear stuff.  Get off of me.  I mean, it was rumble.  It was thunder.  It was like.  By the way, they're playing a lot of music in the dialogue.  Yeah, they are.  But in this case, it is a good show. 
[03:17:30]  They're not hiding.  They're not covering up.  The music, bad thing.  Oh, bad content.  Play the goddamn show.  Here's the black girl praying after the fight, getting ready to talk to Flav.  All right.  Please forgive me for any sins in which I committed those I know and those I don't know.  Lord, Lord, please forgive me for beating this bitch ass today.  Lord, Lord, please forgive me for thinking about beating her ass again.  Lord, please rebuke all these demons that's in this house.  Lord, I pray.  Is that really necessary?  Well, you better quit interrupting my prayers before God direct me to whoop your ass. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, my God.  She's praying.  Praying to God.  This girl has such an attitude and personality, but unfortunately, they had to kick her out.  She would have been the star of the show if she could have kicked her hands to herself.  She's like, I'm going to beat your ass if you keep interrupting my prayers to God.  Please forgive me for any sins in which I committed those I know and those I don't know.  All right.  And now we have Flav talking to the white girl fighter. 
[03:18:30]  I got to get to the bottom of things.  You know what I'm saying?  In order to get to the top of things, you got to get to the bottom of things.  What happened?  All right.  I went in the room because my favorite color is pink.  So me and this other girl went in there and we claimed our beds or whatever.  And then I went out to go check the other rooms just to see what they were like, what the other girls got.  And when I came back, this girl was on my bed.  She was like, well, find her keepers, bitch.  And then she pushed me and hit me in the head. 
[03:19:00]  She kept knocking me in the head.  Like, my head hurts so bad.  You don't understand.  Like, there is a knot back there for sure.  Well, you know what?  It's not going to happen again.  For real.  Flav to the rescue.  Thank you.  All right.  So the white girl explained herself pretty good, right?  Yeah.  You're ready for this.  Listen to the black girl explain to Flav.  Put her out.  Then I brought the black girl up in here. 
[03:19:30]  Well, this is what happened.  I seen the pink bed.  Pink, one of my favorite colors.  I jumped on the bed.  I claimed the bed.  Beep.  No, before I jumped on the bed, I was getting ready to jump on the other girl with the blonde hair with the black in the back.  She was on the bed.  She was jumping.  I said, no, this is my bed.  This is my bed.  So I got up.  She said it was her bed.  I got up off the bed.  I moved to the bed where I didn't see nobody.  Then the girl, the girl, the one who started this stuff, she came over.  She said, no, this is my bed.  I said, this is not your bed.  She said, this is my bed.  I said, no, it's not.  I said, y'all ain't not on this bed.  You ain't got no receipts for this bed. 
[03:20:00]  Then she took my flowers off the pillow.  When she hit me with the flowers, then that's when it just got out of the way.  Then she grabbed my hair, right?  You know I got a weave.  She was trying to pull my track out.  You can't be pulling people tracks and stuff like that.  This is $800 hair.  You can't pull on $800 hair.  You know I got a weave.  How great is she?  Oh, yeah.  She's done already.  She got the boot.  Done.  I should have kept her in, yeah.  And here's the black girl getting kicked out, and she just throws a fit. 
[03:20:30]  I'm a serious guy, G, and I got love for everybody.  And I want everybody in this house to have the same vibe as I got.  Violence is what I can't have.  Sapphire, your time is up, man.  I got to let you go.  Well, first of all, if you don't want to like Violet, Dave, you don't want her either. 
[03:21:00]  She don't want to throw flowers at people just because flowers are supposed to be pleasant.  I was watching the page.  She was sitting on me.  She was trying to put her body all on me and stuff like some lesbian.  I don't even get at them like that.  It's not your bad.  Don't flatter yourself.  Please.  Just because you're here tonight, bitch, you won't be here until the end of the show because  everybody up here look better than you.  Your ass is sagging.  Your shoes is f***ed up.  Your highlights is f***ed up, too.  I don't give a f***ing f*** out of here.  All you bitches, I'll see you again. 
[03:21:30]  I will see you.  You got to watch this show.  I'd love to see the auditions for these.  Yeah, no kidding.  He picked the girls, supposedly, this year.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He got some real winners.  It's the ghetto prom all over again.  Shitting on the carpet.  Flavor Flav will be calling the show tomorrow, right around now.  10 o'clock tomorrow.  Really fast, and we can move on for today.  Listen to this white girl. 
[03:22:00]  Do you need to be?  This is a white girl.  Listen to this.  All right.  I'm the perfect girl for Flav because he's a confident man, and I'm a confident woman.  Woman can fly too, hot stuff.  That's what I like to say, baby.  Plus, he compassionate, you know.  I need a guy that's going to hold me, and a guy that's going to hold me down when you  got to hold it down.  Yeah.  And that sound you heard was her father shooting himself. 
[03:22:30]  Can I do something real fast?  What's that?  I want to thank you for letting me come up in your crib, and for real, for letting me  come meet you.  That's real tight, dog.  So I hooked you up with something.  I made this for you.  My mama picked out the decorations, and I hooked it up just for you.  I got some skill.  Wow.  It got blinged, too.  You match.  I was raised by television.  My mama and dad is probably like Oprah and Jarrett Springer.  That's why I'm like crazy and black. 
[03:23:00]  I think that's why.  You know what time it is.  It's time to get buck wild.  I'm going to change your name.  I like that.  I like that.  I love you for that.  Flave, I love you for that.  Flave just had to name me buck wild because I exude buck wildness, for God's sakes.  I'm going to hold it down in your crib.  All right.  Hold it down in my crib.  I'm going to hold you down, baby.  That girl is as white as you could be.  She does not.  Not even a hint of color. 
[03:23:30]  Wow.  Not even a hint.  Don't you get the douche chill listening to this?  Oh, absolutely.  I love when white people are trying to talk black, how they'll throw in as many black expressions  as they can.  You have to tell you, you know, you listen to a white person when they start like misplacing.  You know, she had to throw in bling.  Yeah.  And mom, daddy, my mom, shut up.  Didn't you used to talk like that?  No, whatever.  I made mistakes when I was 18, but at least I was an alcoholic who was suicidal.  At least I had a reason.  I was only for a year of my life or six months and I got out of it. 
[03:24:00]  Unfortunately, you failed at both.  I am a zilch.  Let's go to Rooster the trucker.  Rooster.  Good morning, guys.  What's up, Rooster?  That ghetto chick, she sounds just like the girl from Boo Got Shot.  We have Boo Got Shot with the translation?  We got to play with the translation today.  All right, we'll play this as we go to break there, Rooster.  All right, man.  Punch it out.  Have a good one.  Thanks for helping us out today.  All right.  Yeah, listen to Boo Got Shot with the translation and we'll continue in just a bit. 
[03:24:30]  She was shaking real bad.  It appears the young lady was trembling from nervousness.  And then she said, Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  Someone has been wounded.  I said, who, who?  I inquired as to who the victim was.  She said, Boo got shot.  Boo has suffered a gunshot wound.  Boo got shot.  Boo has become the victim of another violent crime.  I said, oh my God, oh my God.  Oh me, oh my.  We just saw it.  My sister had called somebody or a pen.  My sibling telephoned another relative.  She called my cousin Pumpkin to sell it up.  In fact, it was my cousin Pumpkin who lives in this very same community. 
[03:25:00]  She called her and Pumpkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  Pumpkin was already on the phone with the local authorities.  And Chi-Chi, she had left out.  Chi-Chi had already departed.  She went and got in her car and she bailed out.  She found her vehicle and put it in reverse.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again.  As she was departing, a shot rang out, piercing the cold night air.  When I heard the gunshot and I seen someone had run in the building over that way. 
[03:25:30]  Apparently, the perpetrator was seeking cover behind a local building.  He ran in that building.  It was that building over there.  And I seen that car just flew off.  I saw the car depart with a rapid acceleration.  And then I seen a long gun.  I saw a firearm of substantial caliber.  A big old gun in it.  I mean, substantial caliber.  The boy was in the backseat, he had a big old long gun.  In fact, it was a gentleman in the backseat who had the firearm with the extended barrel. 
[03:26:00]  Wow, across America, true tales from the road.  Real evil, real stories, real boo.  Yeah, I just want to say thanks for the wow, guys.  Nice pair of young boobies just come by me.  She slowed down, popped them out, and just shook them all over.  Nice.  Thanks.  Only on ONA will you get the wow.  Hey, guys.  Just got wowed on 95 on my way into work.

[03:27:00]  Very proud of my big tip.  Nice.  Old school.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Mike from PalTalk.  He has something for the program today.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to do an old thing.  Blash the hole in the wall with the AR-15.  Wait, you want to shoot your gun again? 
[03:27:30]  Well, yeah.  Just do another hole in the wall with the AR-15.  Yeah, this was the guy that shot his gun in his apartment.  Didn't you, like, hit a pipe or something?  Yeah.  Well, I rent, so it doesn't matter.  What's your screen name?  What's your screen name?  Yeah.  Well, this one that I got now is Guns for You.  Oh, yeah?  Can you act a little more excited? 
[03:28:00]  Hello?  Oh, my God.  I think he's drunk.  Well, I got his camera up, and he is, wow.  He's holding a...  Hold on.  Oh, there it is.  This is an Olympic arms.  This is an O&A special right here.  So, fuck you guys.  Now, wait a minute.  Come on.  Hold on.  No, this is an O&A.  Well, hold on.  Olympic arms.  Olympic arms.  What state do you live in? 
[03:28:30]  Wisconsin.  Wisconsin.  And what's outside your house?  Oh, it's not Wisconsin.  It's Wisconsin.  What, what, what, what's outside your house for a mile around you?  SWAT team.  Probably SWAT team's ready for me, so...  Sir, don't repeat my bombed joke.  What is outside your house?  What neighbors do you have?  He's gonna shoot the camera.  He's putting his laser sight. 
[03:29:00]  I will.  You fuckers.  You fucking with me.  No, I'm not fucking with you.  Oh, crap.  We would never fuck with a guy like you.  No private pile.  We're not fucking with you.  Don't you have mail to deliver?  Oh, no.  Don't shoot your camera.  I don't know what he's doing.  Just don't make sure you don't shoot it where anybody is, please.  We haven't said anything.  We haven't said to shoot this thing.  Let's make that perfectly clear.  Yeah, I, I, I don't, I don't like this guy.  He scares me. 
[03:29:30]  You're scaring us.  Yeah, cause, cause you, yeah, I got kicked off of pal talk the last time because of you  guys.  Why?  What happened, son?  No, cause, cause, uh, what I did when, when I fucking blasted a hole in the wall, I'm  not going to do it right now.  No, cause, cause, uh, what the fuck?  Right.  Dude, you, you, you, I'm just saying, I, you know, as soon as I did that the last time,  I, I, I took a hole in the wall and then, you know, yeah, I was like, I had leaky pipes 
[03:30:00]  and shit, and then all of a sudden, yeah, I, I couldn't get on pal talk.  What, uh, what are you drinking this afternoon, this morning?  Whatever.  You know, no, no, you know damn well what I'm talking about, cause I'm sure there's other  people that, that, that, you know, the same thing happened to them.  You sound angry.  Yeah, why are you angry, Mike?  Well, I'm, I'm, I'm not, like, uh, a stern fan, if that's what you're going for. 
[03:30:30]  No, we don't think you're a stern fan.  No, I'm just saying, you sound like you're, you're, you're all worked up about something.  And you sound like you might be on drugs.  No, no, I'm not, I, no, no, I, I, you know, I love you guys, I, I just, I work nights,  so, like, right now is, like, my prime time, so.  Oh, so you're partying a little bit.  Yeah, well, a little bit.  What, what are you drinking, beer?  Well, just regular light beer.  Light beer? 
[03:31:00]  And it's what, like, you know, still pretty early in the morning.  You guys, you guys.  You guys, that's what you hear right before he shoots you.  You guys, you guys.  What kind of work do you do, Mike?  You know?  Mike.  Yeah, I, I, I drive.  Okay.  I drive right now.  Cool.  He's holding the gun again.  And then, like, you know, I, you know, I beat people for a living, so, you know, whatever.  Well, I'd rather, because you sound a little tipsy, I'd rather you don't shoot when you're 
[03:31:30]  drunk.  Yeah, well, I, I kind of figured that.  Yeah.  So, the, the guy that I talked to earlier, so.  Yeah.  And maybe, like, you know.  He kind of made it, he, he said that.  Maybe if you've got a range or somewhere that, you know, you're not going to shoot through  a wall and hit the neighbor or something, maybe, you know, in that case.  But we really can't condone you firing off a, a weapon in your house of that caliber while  you're drunk and us not knowing what's outside those thin walls. 
[03:32:00]  Can we get in trouble for that?  I would say yes.  You know, okay, you're going to hang up on me, right?  No, we're not.  No, we're just.  No, no, no, no.  We did this already before, though.  It was like, you know, it was the same, same caliber, same.  Yeah, no, no, I, I understand.  We did it before and we got very lucky.  Um, here, pull.  Yeah, exactly.  Pull the magazine out of that thing.  Go ahead, pull the magazine out.  Yeah, nice.  He's got the gun again.  All right.  Hi, Joker.  Oh, whatever.  There he goes, pull. 
[03:32:30]  All right, hang on.  Pull the magazine out.  I wouldn't read what PalTalk is saying about you, by the way.  All right, now put that on the table.  Put that on the table.  Put that on the table in front of you.  All right.  Okay, now pick up the weapon and eject.  Hey, which one?  Do you have one?  This one?  Oh, my God, he's got more.  The other one.  You don't have one in the, oh, God.  You are loaded for bear.  You are loaded for bear.  Which one?  No, do you, you don't have.  Which one?  You don't have one chamber, do you?  Which one? 
[03:33:00]  Dude.  You fucking fag.  Dude, you don't have one.  Dude.  Come on, you fuckers.  I got fucking four of them right here.  Hey, open the breach of the rifle.  Open it.  Why?  No, no, no.  Go ahead.  You guys are just kidding.  Just open it.  Don't be a faggot, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Open it up.  Oh, I'm not.  You guys are.  You don't even know what the fuck this is.  Open it up.  All right.  Now, keep it like that until you sober up, you fucking lunatic. 
[03:33:30]  Fuckers.  This guy rocks.  Come on.  Come on.  That's all you got?  Mike, you rock.  I say you rock.  Come on.  I think you're gay.  No, no, no.  I was going to do something.  You know what I'm saying.  All right, listen.  This is all I want to do.  Mike, listen to me.  It's Opie talking.  Whatever you do, do not read what they're writing about you on Pal Talk.  Do not.  I don't give a fuck what they're saying on Pal Talk.  I'll read it later. 
[03:34:00]  No, read it right now.  Read it live on the air.  You're making your mouth function.  I'm watching you guys right now.  That's all I care about.  No, do us a favor, though.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Mike, read what they're saying about you.  All right.  Just read some of the comments.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't care.  What do they say?  You know what?  I should have shot myself a long time ago.  I don't give a fuck.  Come on.  You fuckers.  You fucking.  Yeah.  You don't want to do it. 
[03:34:30]  Come on.  You fucking.  Let's do the fucking AR-15 in the wall again.  Come on.  We did it once before.  The finger banging old Mary Jane's Russian crotch through her pretty pink panties are over.  Come on.  We did it before.  Let's do it again.  What are they writing about you?  Read some of the comments.  I don't care.  I'm not even reading it.  I'm.  You know, I've been waiting on lines.  Let's do the fucking AR-15 in the wall.  No.  You better not.  I don't know what's behind.  I don't know what's behind your wall. 
[03:35:00]  You guys suck.  Yeah, we suck.  Come on.  Sir, the fact that we're peers.  I'm just kidding.  I don't mean you guys suck.  I don't mean you suck.  You suck.  I don't mean.  No, no.  But come on now.  You're too drunk to be firing weapons, sir.  That's not safe.  Yeah, show us your weapons again.  I want to see what you got in the house.  What do you got in your house?  Let's see this.  I got a lot of shit.  Yeah, let's see what you got.  Well, I need fucking time, sweetheart.  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  Look at this.  He's waving that.  Oh, shit. 
[03:35:30]  Come on.  Let's do the fucking 45 in the wall.  Oh, my God.  Can I do that?  No.  He's just holding up a 45.  Take your finger off the trigger.  Take your finger off the trigger.  Hold that thing safe.  Oh, my God.  He's pointing a 45 at the camera, you lunatic.  Come on.  Let's fucking do it.  No, let's not do anything.  You don't want to do the Air 15?  Let's do the fucking 45.  No.  Oh, my God.  Put the 45 down.  All right.  Let's see what else.  Whatever.  He's all drunk, waving around a 45. 
[03:36:00]  Let's do some other ones in there.  All right.  What else you got?  What else you got, Mike?  Oh, I got a lot of shit, dude.  Oh, my God.  This guy.  Got any grenades?  This guy's creeping me out.  I can't look away.  Oh, my God.  I got a lot of stuff.  Dude, I got a walk-in fucking safe, though.  I, yeah.  Anyway.  You at best not fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck. 
[03:36:30]  No, you fucking play what you want.  You know, come on, man.  We fucking did the fucking Air 15 in a while.  Yeah, I know.  What do you want from us, Mike?  What do you want from us?  What do you want from us?  That was people trying to fucking, like, pal talk me here now.  I don't want to do that.  Fucking go away.  No, seriously.  You know what the fuck?  Well, what do you want from us?  Never mind.  I don't want anything.  I just thought it'd make for good radio to do another hole in the wall with the Air 15. 
[03:37:00]  That's all I wanted.  Yeah, but you're a little drunk this time around.  No, I'm not.  I'm not at all.  You sound, like, pretty fucked up.  Yeah, where's the other hole?  Where's the old hole?  Is it still around?  You want to see it?  Yeah.  All right, Mike's moving his camera.  I remember this guy.  Yeah, he did shoot a gun in his apartment.  It's right over there.  Where?  There it is.  I saw it.  Where?  Yeah.  There's two of them.  Right there over the... 
[03:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Right on to the right of the chair.  Some fucking phone books there, because I was going to do the one today.  But no, it doesn't seem like you guys want to fucking do that, so...  No, you sound a little...  And then everybody's calling me a fucking pussy.  How close are your neighbors?  They're gone right now.  No, I don't care if they're gone.  How close is their house?  That's far.  All right, well... 
[03:38:00]  I cannot sit here and...  You in a house or an apartment?  Oh, my God.  Fucking...  Doggo Doug fucking driving me crazy right now.  I got his address if you need it.  Fuck that.  Dude, seriously, I was going to...  Never mind.  Fuck it.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  You know what?  I...  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  That's fine.  Dude, being gay is not a big deal.  We don't care.  Yeah, whatever, dude. 
[03:38:30]  Whatever.  Yeah.  All talk, no action.  What can I tell you?  You're crazy, man.  You fuckers.  I love you guys.  Dude, can you point a gun at the camera again?  I got a lot of fucking guns.  I got a lot of fucking guns.  Look at that.  It's so crazy.  Oh, my God.  Look at the size of that barrel.  Big 45.  That'll rip a big hole in you.  Just pointing at the screen.  Don't shoot.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Fucking 45.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:39:00]  Well, he's just showing us his 45.  That's all.  Holy crap.  Yeah, I'm just showing it so you guys don't get in trouble, okay?  You know how awful that would be in real life?  I don't want you guys to get in trouble.  I don't want you guys to get in trouble.  Pointing at you.  Shit.  Just horrifying.  That's my wife.  Yeah.  Just so you guys don't get in trouble.  Yeah.  Fuckers.  Fuckers.  What?  You're real.  This guy's hysterical.  You damn well what I'm talking about, you fuckers.  Oh, yeah.  You say, oh, he's drunk.  What do you want from us, Mike? 
[03:39:30]  No, I just want to do a fucking other.  So you want us to give the okays?  We're at a standstill here.  No, I know you can't.  You want us to give the old okay, right?  I know you can't do that now, okay?  I understand that, but.  He's too drunk to be handling weapons.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I'm sure you have a city ordinance that says discharge of firearms prohibited within city limits.  I had to fix the fucking leak from the last time.  It was fucking water, man. 
[03:40:00]  Anyway.  You're fucked up, dude.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Okay, I am.  You sound like a jovial man.  Yeah.  I just like hearing him talk with that music from Full Metal Jack.  I know.  It's really creepy.  It's really creepy.  Dude, and I was supposed to.  I was going to fucking crank something up so I could blast this fucking round, but.  Yeah, let's see the firepower again.  All right.  You sure?  Yeah, I just want to see it.  All right.  Well, I'm going to crank up something real loud. 
[03:40:30]  Don't shoot it.  Wait, what is he doing?  Don't shoot it, stupid.  No, I'm not going to shoot it.  Okay.  What is he cranking up?  He was cranking up the radio or the TV.  That was a remote control, Jimmy.  All right.  I thought it was a little gun.  Nice weapon identification you got there.  I'm far away.  I don't know.  He was holding a gun.  You make a great cop.  You want me to do it or not?  Holding a donut and you shoot him.  I thought it was a roundy round gun.  Oh, I, uh, he's, he, I don't know what he's doing. 
[03:41:00]  Wow.  You are definitely like Private Pyle.  Now, don't shoot it, though, man.  Keep the magazine out.  Keep the magazine out.  Don't, uh, no.  Oh, no.  Don't pull that back.  Oh, shit.  He just tampered around.  No, Mike.  No, no.  Mike, don't do it.  That thing is ready to go.  Don't, no, no.  Oh, God, no.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Jesus.  I'm not.  Don't do it. 
[03:41:30]  What is he doing?  Holy fuck, that was fucking loud.  What is he doing?  Knock it off.  Dude, you can't be shooting a weapon like that, man.  Will you cut it out?  Oh, I was just kidding.  I was just kidding.  I was just kidding.  No.  I was just kidding.  I was just kidding.  I didn't fucking do anything.  You know, you have another round now in that chamber.  You're right. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Pull the, pull the fucking magazine out and, and clear that.  It's on.  All right.  Clear the fucking weapon, you maniac.  He's got a laser sight on us now.  All right.  I did it.  All right.  All right.  That's the lunatic.  Everything.  No, it was just a, it was just a joke.  It was just a joke shooting.  Don't come on, right?  Oh my God.  Laser sight's gone.  No, we're just kidding.  Right?  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  Look, we, we, we, we gotta go.  This is the next step for pests.  We arm them.  All right.  Well, you guys have a good day.  You too.  No joke.  It's a joke.  No joke.  Of course it is.  Cheers.  Yeah, there he is drinking.  Of course.  Just gave us a cheers.  All right.  Cheers again.  All right, man.  All right, there you go.  Wow.  Great.  Yeah.  It's the day that the post report is here.  This is terrific. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, you should have seen him run to the window and look when he heard that weapon discharge.  All right, Mike.  Bye, Mike.  Stay alive, all right?  Yeah, stop fucking around with the guns.  Stay alive, Mike.  There he goes.  Mike from Pal Talk.  Very, very creepy with that music playing.  Drunk with weapons.  I think he's been drinking.  Unbelievable.  That was really creepy.  That's what, yeah.  What it feels like to have two vaginas.  You have to have a wife and a daughter.  If we don't do this today, we're not doing our jobs. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, here it is.  This is from Esquire Magazine.  Esquire.  By someone that will remain anonymous according to the article.  She's 41.  She's a record company executive.  And she talks about having two vaginas.  She waited until she was in her 40s to tell us what that's all about.  I didn't know.  I didn't know anything was different about me until I was 15.  I was having all sorts of pain, woman stuff.  But I'd get it checked out, and they wouldn't find anything wrong. 
[03:44:00]  I guess the eighth doctor was more thorough.  I remember I was lying there, and I heard her say, oops.  It was more than just the tablets.  Right.  I was bottomless.  The art of the vagina.  The double vagina.  What I've got is a rare condition called the delphic uterus.  Two vaginas, two cervices.  Cervic.  Cervic.  Cervic.  Cervices.  Thank you.  And two uteruses.  Wow.  I look completely normal from the outside, but there's a septum inside where everything 
[03:44:30]  branches into two.  Oh.  Yuck.  My doctor says I'm one in a million.  Old snuffleupagus.  What?  You have to fuck one hole and then throw hay into the other?  I hope she saved the second vagina for the second half of her life.  Yeah.  You could wear out the first one.  Wear it out in the first 40 and use the second one for the second 40.  Or at least do us a favor and put a sign over one that says whites only. 
[03:45:00]  That's the joke.  Yeah.  Just beat the shit out of one of them and keep the other one for special occasions.  But there's not, there's obviously like one puss.  There's like one hole.  Yeah.  There's one hole, but then there's a septum.  It gets better.  Because you can get at both vaginas.  Yeah.  For a while, I thought I was a total freak.  I lost my virginity twice.  Hmm.  Interesting.  The first time was when I was 18. 
[03:45:30]  Then I lost the other side two weeks later.  To the same guy.  Oh.  You think I could have saved one of them for marriage.  Yeah.  No shit.  When I was dating, I'd just say, so I have a little something to tell you.  I never got any other reaction except, oh my God, that's so cool.  Because they'd want to have sex in both sides and see what it felt like.  Apparently, the right side is, well, more normal.  Well, the left side is a lot smaller. 
[03:46:00]  Fuck her in the left side.  Oh, yeah.  That's for her Asian friends.  I'm left-handed.  Could you roll over on your side again?  I'm going to have to do the left side again.  But they're both tight.  Could you imagine doing that and keeping your dick hard, knowing there's two, like a fucking  two holes?  Yeah.  Like a nose?  Fucking nostrils.  But they're both tight.  That's a plus.  I've got two G spots.  So I've always appreciated men who are extra dexterous with their fingers. 
[03:46:30]  I get to have two orgasms at the same time.  Wow.  And two periods.  There's three days a month she's not a cunt.  Like a one-man band.  She's got symbols between her knees.  You've got to time it out perfectly or not.  I have to wear...  Well, here's the downside, ladies.  Just when you thought this was a lucky girl.  Yep.  Here's the downside, ladies.  I have to wear two tampons. 
[03:47:00]  She ties the strings together like a little cottony nunchucks.  I have to wear two tampons when I get my period.  It was hard to get pregnant, too, because it's hard to know which side the egg is on.  Oh, wow.  Peek-a-boo.  That and I had to have a C-section when I had my first child recently.  Every time I go in for a pap smear, the doctor's like, do you mind if I call in a few people?  That's funny.  You see the janitor walk in?  Some of his friends?  Parking attendants. 
[03:47:30]  Guy's holding a mop, just peeking at her twat.  Mind if I call in some friends?  Check out this pussy.  Yeah.  Because, you know, we've all heard of this, but we've never seen it.  You get used to all the questions, and I'm not really shy about it.  Every once in a while, I'll tell a guy, and he'll say, no way.  I have two penises.  That would be fantastic.  Yeah.  Me and my friends.  Yeah, she could have a DP thing going.  That's a little gay, though, because I guess before the septum, you'd be rubbing a stick together. 
[03:48:00]  You'd have to get in the septum first before it branches out.  Yeah.  Let's go to Amat from South Carolina.  Amat.  Hey, man.  It's Mike.  Hey, man.  Mike?  Yeah, Mike.  Wow.  Wow.  Your accent really fucked one of the screeners up, because they spelled your name A-M-A-A-T.  Well, that's because he's ignorant.  It ain't his fault.  Nope.  That's his heart.  Hey, uh, I have a feeling y'all's in the middle of y'all's last show, you know?  Why?  We didn't tell that guy to shoot the gun. 
[03:48:30]  Absolutely.  Motherfucker, I had some cringing going on.  I thought he was going to kill himself.  Hey, dude.  I was telling that guy to keep that fucking weapon unloaded.  Sweet Jesus on a Sunday morning, man.  He needs to get a light or something, Bubba.  Anyway.  We had to play it out.  Y'all be careful.  We had to play it out, but we never said to shoot the damn thing.  We picked it up and just shot it.  Well, that's why y'all was doing the radio and I'm listening, because, Bubba, I'll tell  you, I would have went apeshit with it, man.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Y'all keep it going.  You don't want to see a guy kill somebody, man.  That's right, man. 
[03:49:00]  All right, boys.  Y'all be careful and have a Merry Christmas.  All right, thank you, sir.  Sweet Jesus on a Sunday morning.  How do you not like that?  That's great.  What was that communique?  I don't like communiques.  Jimmy Jakes from Whackbag.  Her cunt looks like a toaster.  No, you know what it looks like?  Bravo, sir.  And then you put the thumb in the asshole, one finger in each hole, and you ball her out  the door, and you're done.  A perfect strike right through the screen door. 
[03:49:30]  Wow.  And then Vanilla Thunder say, it's really cool, because guys think I'm twice as interesting  as normal women.  The Colombians pay me twice as much to mule heroin.  We lost our...  Oh, my gosh.  She has her period.  The inside of her panties looks like a shotgun was fired in them.  Oh, this is the line.  The line. 
[03:50:00]  Sean from Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Possibly the line of the day.  With two pussies, does she have a colon instead of a period?  Oh, hey.  Very good.  Very funny.  A little punctuation joke is always hysterical.  All right.  That would freak me out, man.  I would never be able to do that.  He has two vaginas, do you?  Let's go to Theo in Virginia.  Theo.  Hey, I just want to visually say I've found my fetish.  This is what I'm all about now.  Dude, that's awful. 
[03:50:30]  How could you have reached around there and feel two different directions?  I'm thinking double thumbs, and you could work it like a Nintendo controller.  All right.  Let's go to Lead Belly.  Lead Belly.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Lead Belly from Full Blown Age.  Yeah, right on.  A line you guys missed.  What?  Norton said that there's three days out of a month, she's not a cunt.  I ain't quite that.  Yes, we heard that.  Yeah, we got that one.  I got a laugh.  Thank you, sir.  I should have got a bigger one.  I'll agree, sir.  Good point. 
[03:51:00]  Let's go to Mike in Ohio.  Mike?  Yeah, if you get the bitch pregnant, you're going to have to kick her down the stairs twice.  Token Gay, what's up?  Double the pleasure.  Double the cunt.  I didn't know where he was going with that, but he went to Funnyville.  All right.  I guess we're just about done for today.  She's got two vaginas.  We didn't talk about the conjoined twins. 
[03:51:30]  No.  That's a freak show.  You want to do it really fast?  Literally.  All right, really fast.  Here's the update.  But we begin right now with a new chapter in the life of the conjoined twins, conjoined no more.  They are embarking on separate lives, the Heron twins.  2020's Deborah Roberts has been with the family all night.  She's bringing us the latest on their recovery this morning.  Erin and Jake Heron finally got the answer to their prayers.  For the first time, their four-year-old twin daughters sleeping in separate beds. 
[03:52:00]  I'm so grateful to be their mother, and we are such proud parents of two separate little girls.  Despite a staggering 26-hour surgery, remarkably, there were no complications.  Even the surgeons were surprised.  So we're each on their own little bed now.  We're going to start reconstructing, okay?  And they're doing great.  For the entire Heron clan, it was an emotional, sleepless night full of intense hope. 
[03:52:30]  Our babies are born.  That's what it's like.  All over again.  Yeah.  That's really what it's like.  But this one was a mess, right?  Oh.  They decided which one could have the leg and all that.  It had a liver.  Right.  And then they shared a couple of...  A kidney?  What, they have one kidney?  One kidney.  One kidney.  The mom has two different.  The mom's got to now, in a couple of weeks or so, give the other kid the kidney.  They shared...  They only had two legs. 
[03:53:00]  So they had to cut her up the middle and give each one a leg.  This is like...  It's like Thanksgiving.  They split the vag?  Is the vag split?  See, that's what I don't know.  And they never say things that are the most interesting things that you really want to know.  There has to be one vag.  Who got the vag?  Who gets the vagina?  The pretty one.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You got to give it to the fat one because then she'll have nothing if she doesn't have  that.  The other one will have friends and go to parties.  Let's go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, back to the girl with the vagina problem. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Jim said that it creeps her out.  He doesn't think he could do it.  He doesn't mind the girl urinating and accidentally taking a dump on him.  Sir, that's what makes me the cutest boy in town.  That's why we love you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  Let's go to Chuck in Arizona.  Chuck.  Yeah.  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  All right, Chuck.  This is Jimmy's ideal woman.  She can pee in his mouth and in his chest at the same time.  And do what?  Pee in his mouth and on his chest at the same time. 
[03:54:00]  Very funny.  All right.  All right.  Very good, bro.  All right.  Punch it out.  Have a great day.  The girls had been born in a perpetual hug is what it is.  They're attached from the front.  So who knows about like badge.  That would get inconvenient after a while.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Their little bodies fused at the midsection so that they were practically face to face.  They shared a liver, a kidney, a pelvis, one set of legs, and part of their intestines.  The surgeons gave each girl one leg, split their liver and intestines, and reconstructed 
[03:54:30]  their bladders and their pelvic rings.  Kendra kept one of the functioning kidneys while Malia will be put on dialysis and receive  one of her mother's kidneys in a transplant in three to six months.  Wow.  Holy mackerel.  Malik said he feared the gaping separation wound on the girl's body would be difficult 
[03:55:00]  to close, but the tissue expanders placed in the twins weeks ago to grow their skin and  muscles combined with plastic surgery made the job easier.  So they're going to have big scars, but it beats being face to face forever.  Yeah.  Just staring at somebody.  Hi.  Hello.  All right.  I know.  How are you?  You should know you're looking at me.  How was your day the same as yours, only backwards?  I know.  Are you hungry?  Why can't we get a perfect cell phone signal?  They were able to do this, right? 
[03:55:30]  They were able to do this.  Are you kidding me?  Everything they ever eat, you have to watch them eat it?  Just, are you going to eat?  Look at you.  Get out of my face.  Will you stop?  I'd rather not do this.  I can't.  You say potato, I say kill us both.  Let's go to David in San Antonio.  David.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I just wanted to point out, I don't know if anybody noticed, but I don't think that it's 
[03:56:00]  too hard to see that it's the dad's fault these kids are born conjoint.  His name was Aaron Heron.  What a douche.  Aaron Heron.  And that's the reason why?  No, the mother's name is Aaron Heron.  You dope.  The father's Jake.  Jake Heron.  And Aaron.  Oh, well, it's her fault then.  All right.  They also have a six-year-old daughter and twin 14-month-old boys.  Oh, Perrin and Merrin.  Perrin's.  Aaron.  14.  Herrin.  14-month-old boys?  14-month-old boys, which means they gave it another shot after this disaster came out. 
[03:56:30]  And they were twins.  All right.  Let's, uh, a little more audio here.  But doctors caution that this is indeed a marathon, not a sprint.  The girls have been through major trauma.  Pick her up like you're holding a baby.  Their little bodies will need time to heal from massive wounds.  But Kendra and Malia have a history of beating the odds.  Born prematurely, doctors wondered if they would ever crawl.  They did.  They're surprising us every day. 
[03:57:00]  Every minute.  I bet.  They're surprising us.  And now their biggest battle yet.  I like them.  Every day is critical.  Malia does not have a kidney and must endure dialysis.  It will be months before there's talk of a transplant.  And psychologically, the twins will have to get used to being apart from one another.  Their beds will be placed side by side so they can hold on to their special sisterhood.  Jake Heron has called his daughter's separation a rebirth, an exciting beginning, to a whole 
[03:57:30]  new chapter in their now separate lives.  For Good Morning America, Deborah Roberts, ABC News, Salt Lake City, Utah.  The audience is like tiny warriors for their own survival.  Victim of the morning.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Pat from Menarche.  Hey, Pat.  I'm glad those kids got separated okay or they'd have to get buried in a conjoined coffin. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Do you know, Pat?  Yes.  As I was listening to this replay yesterday, I wanted to tell you how amusing you were on  radio yesterday.  It was fun to listen to you.  I didn't mean to say two.  I meant to say 200.  But then you call in today.  Yeah.  The lady with two vagas, she can't have conjoined twins.  They get separated.  Think.  All right.  Thank you, Pat.  Wow.  That was an autobahn pileup. 
[03:58:30]  Wow.  Let's go to Josh in Dallas.  Oh, Pat.  Took a nice bombing.  Oh, finally.  Those were conjoined bombs.  Josh.  Hey, the news report.  You're the man with two throats and something funny didn't come out of either of them.  The news report said that it was a marathon, not a sprint.  Are you sure it wasn't a three-legged race?  Oh, wow.  Punching out, fellas.  All right.  They only had two.  How do they give them one leg each if they're facing each other? 
[03:59:00]  Like, which way were the legs going?  I don't know.  Which way, this is a fucking mess.  Dude, she has these weird twins that conjoin, then she has some more twins.  Her fucking eggs get tossed around like Yahtzee dice.  Really?  What a mess.  I mean, this kid, I mean, I'm sure they love it and everything and them now or whatever it is.  But the second it came out, it should have just been put in a big pickle jar and just  sat on a shelf at a circus because it should have went on tour.  Yeah.  They'll have relatively normal lives, though, like on a fake leg. 
[03:59:30]  Maybe one of them will land a beetle.  You never know.  Heather Mills gives fucking hope to everyone.  Horrid.  That's how it ends today.  Good luck.  Godspeed.  I think it's good they separated them.  That's my bold statement today.  It's good.  I'm happy the kids lived.  We got an interview to do, so we should get out of here.  Oh, we do.  Damn.  Talk to that guy right there.  You got to see if I shoot his gun today.  Into a wall.  Yeah, that's what happens on this show.  Remember, we did not egg him on. 
[04:00:00]  I'm going to stop.  I've made him unload his weapon twice.  There you go.  All right, we're out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for checking us out today.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the bread.  Squeeze the bread.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive.  Yeah.  That a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  We hope you're in an infamy show.  We'll be in an infamy show. 
[04:00:30]  In case you didn't know.  Okay.  Yeah.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  illegal information. </pre>
