<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of the reality TV show *Temptation Island*, focusing on the explicit sexual behavior displayed by the participants.  Callers, including Darren (who offered insider information about the show's production) and the frequently mentioned "Psycho Mark" and "Psycho Martha," contributed to the vulgar and highly offensive commentary.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a bizarre fifteen-minute segment hosted by callers "Annoying Laugh Anthony" and "Stalker Patty," filled with awkwardness and off-color remarks.  The hosts then transitioned into "Stalker P Limo A Show," a similarly informal and vulgar segment hosted by Limo A and Stalker Patty, featuring numerous callers.  These callers ranged from those complimenting Limo A's voice to those making offensive comments directed at Patty or expressing infatuation with Opie and Anthony (including Kelly), and one even making a bomb threat.  A caller named Sumo threatened violence.

The hosts interspersed this with a horoscope reading, sports talk (Giants and Jets), and a rambling, derogatory discussion about a planned trip to Winona, Mississippi, with a listener named Susie.  Numerous live reads for advertisers, such as Rockaway Bedding and Stacker 2, were included, often in a comedic and irreverent manner.  Several guests, Rich Voss, Jeff Norris ("Gorilla Boy"), and Vinny ("Vinny the racist"), joined the studio, contributing to the already vulgar and offensive banter, including racially charged jokes.  Discussions of upcoming live performances were also included.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a story recounted by Rich Voss detailing a sexual encounter involving himself, another man (Norton), and a woman, which led to a debate about Voss's sexuality, rife with homophobic slurs.  Jeff Norris, Vinny, and other staff members participated, contributing to the homophobic remarks and crude jokes.  The conversation included playful antagonism between Voss and Norris, and significant promotion of "The Nasty Show" at Caroline's Comedy Club, featuring Voss, Norris, Norton, Otto, George, and TJ Stone.  The broadcast concluded with giveaways—WWF tickets and a trip to New Orleans—and a humorous phone call segment with a listener named Ruben.  Throughout the entire broadcast, profanity and sexually explicit language were pervasive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Come here!  Come on, son!  Come, come, come!  Oh, boy!  Fight!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, suck it!  Hey!  Daddy, can I come, too?  Don't forget to swallow!  Stand over, baby bub!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Nothing's better than a busting! 
[00:00:30]  Oh, okay, terrific!  Hey, she got my mouth!  Yeah, suck it!  Hey!  Come!  Come, come, come!  This tastes so good!  Bend over, baby bub!  Hey!  Come!  Hey!  Come!  Hey!  Torture!  Torture!  Don't, don't, don't just stare at it, eat it!  Hey!  Who stopped getting me all excited?  Hey! 
[00:01:00]  That old gag!  Wow!  Wow!  Oh!  Damn you!  Shut up, Jeremy!  Damn you!  All paid, terrific!  Terrific!  1027 WNEW!  It doesn't matter how many women he has sex with, I'll never, you know, another woman  would never love him as much as I did!  And he doesn't know how bad he hurts when he does these things! 
[00:01:30]  Are you kidding me?  So that's what the girls were dealing with before they took their boat ride.  Yeah.  The funniest part of Temptation Island last night was the guys said goodbye to their girlfriends  and they were really, really upset.  Teary-eyed.  And the next thing you know, you see the boat slowly pull away and it was in the middle  of night, you could just feel what they were thinking.  Yeah.  On the screen it says, 30 minutes later. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And the next scene you see is...  Woo!  It is a party!  Party at the little tiki bar with the girls that are supposed to tempt them for the next  two weeks.  Yeah.  There they are, they're frolicking in the pool, they're getting hammered, the girls are  hanging on the guys.  30 minutes later.  30 minutes.  And the girls are listening to...  And they're all like, where's the sea?  Where are the big seas?  And the guys are partying.  Here's the black guy pissed off. 
[00:02:30]  I feel a little pissed off.  You know, here it is.  I'm not going to see her for two weeks.  She blows up.  She can't get this back.  It's not like she can, you know, two hours from now say, well, I'm sorry.  And then we're going to see each other again because we're not.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Ho.  So...  And that's pretty much where they left it.  Yeah, but they did show some very interesting scenes from the upcoming episodes.  You know the guy with the shaved head?  Yeah, Billy.  Billy. 
[00:03:00]  He...  There's another rule of the show where you have these bonfire rituals with the trying  to do the survivor torch thing.  But they all sit in front of a bonfire.  The guys separately from the girls.  And they can choose whether they want to watch a videotape, an unedited videotape of their  significant other's date and how it went and talk of the guy that she dated.  Right.  And whatnot.  From the other side of the island.  From the other side.  They can't even like...  Even if they're pissed off at the significant other, they can't even confront them until 
[00:03:30]  this is over.  So now he can choose to watch this.  So the bald-headed, the shaved-headed guy starts watching the videotape of his chick  with another guy.  And here's what he said.  Well, this is the whole thing.  Oh, this is the whole thing?  Let her rip.  In terms of temptation, she was made to order for me.  This is the most fun thing I've ever done.  I might not ever have the chance to flirt with boys about any consequences ever again.  I saw Kaya laughing, having a good time with this pretty girl, her hair blowing in the 
[00:04:00]  wind.  That just made me sick.  And reality sets in as the couples are introduced to the bonfire ritual.  Tonight is about some choices.  Where they are confronted with a crucial decision.  I'm going to give you a chance to see videotape of who your girlfriend's date is.  We have a highlight, an unedited highlight, from their experience on their date.  For some, it's a relief.  Look at this smile.  For others, it's a painful experience.  Are you okay?  And here are some scenes from future episodes of Temptation Island. 
[00:04:30]  Oh my God!  I'm so sorry!  I don't think I'm going to watch the rest of that.  This is an island of temptation.  There he was!  He willingly came.  There it is.  He was watching the video of his girl having the guys do shots out of her belly button.  Yeah, doing shots out of her belly button.  First of all, this big black guy comes over and he's just sucking booze out of her belly.  And then before you know it, she's tonguing someone.  Yeah.  She's kissing somebody.  And this is the video the guy has seen at the bonfire ritual. 
[00:05:00]  And he goes, ah.  He just shuts down the little portable plate.  I don't think I need to see anymore.  I don't want to see anymore.  Whatever.  I don't think I want to watch anymore of this.  And he's like ready to cry.  Right.  And then they show him walking down the beach.  And the camera's following him.  Oh, you got that clip too?  Yeah, this guy gets pissed.  He goes, turn it off.  I'm serious.  This is my life.  He goes, turn it off.  I'm serious.  This is my life.  Yeah.  He goes, turn it off.  I'm serious.  This is my life.  Hey, hey, hey, A-hole.  You signed that away.  It was all fun and games in the beginning.  Man, this show looks like it's going to be a hit. 
[00:05:30]  It's going to blow up.  It's going to blow up.  It really looks like it's going to be a hit.  And it's all about effing.  Darren, what's going on?  Darren, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  This show looks like it's going to be a hit.  But man, this show looks like it's going to be a hit  It's going to blow up  It really looks like it's going to be a hit  And it's all about effing 
[00:06:00]  Darren, what's going on?  Hey guys, what's up?  Hey  This show is going to not only break up those four couples  It's going to break up couples throughout the nation  How's that?  I'm telling you  First of all, a beautiful thing for them to do is  I think, I don't know if they were playing either spin the bottle  They were doing something because one of the girls was kissing one of the guys  That's when they showed that mental case where the bald guy is  Yeah, Billy  Yeah, he's going to blow up  He's going to go insane  Yeah, you know he's going to lose his effing mind  Oh yeah  He's going to wind up punching someone and getting kicked off the island  Something ridiculous like that 
[00:06:30]  Anyway, I'm watching the show  And my girlfriend calls me up like a minute later  If you were on that effing island  You would probably kiss the girl  We got in a fight  I know  Yeah, this is really a volatile show to watch  In the first 60 seconds we started fighting  Can I give advice to everybody out there?  Don't watch it with your girlfriend  Exactly  Ridiculous  I watched it in the office today  I don't want to deal with that  I don't want any discussions about Temptation Island  I want to just enjoy the show for what it is 
[00:07:00]  Yeah  Well, you know it's not going to happen  Because you know your girlfriend is going to watch it open  You know she's going to call you in  She already saw it and actually she thought it was she really liked the show  But I just don't I really don't want to see it with it  It's painful  I don't want to deal with it  I don't want to enjoy the show  I don't want questions  I don't want circumstances  I don't want any of that  And don't comment on it  I know  Just sit and watch  But don't open your mouth until it's over  Because probably anything you say  You won't  Might cause a problem  Right  And as soon as those girls came out  There was that one hot Chinese broad 
[00:07:30]  My girlfriend called me up  She goes  I would take her off the island  Because I know you would nail the gook  She nailed the gook  Who's your girlfriend?  Psycho Mark?  Right  Yeah yeah yeah  Zip in the wire  Psycho Martha  That host is  I forgot his name  Mark Wahlberg  That's it  He was the host  Not the Mark Wahlberg  He was the host of Double Bear  So they're really getting high quality guys  Oh that's where he's from  Okay  Super sloppy Tentation Island  That's right  So they're getting high quality guys 
[00:08:00]  Alright Darren  Thank you  Thanks guys  Later  Listen we do have to take a break  Quickly  Henchman from Brooklyn though  It was just so funny  That ten minutes after the black guy was pissed  He was chilling like Tupac  In the get around video  He really was  Listen there's a lot of people on hold  With their comments about Temptation Island  Please stay on hold  We'll get to every single one of you  Okay  Quick break and we'll be back  Oh wow  O.P.

[00:09:00]  But uh  Listen man that show  Temptation Island  Yeah  It is wild  It's wild dude  It's wild  Yeah  It's wild  Um I see a lot of  Not only breaking up  But I see some violence happening on that thing  Yeah it looks like there's potential of some fisticuffs  Yeah it looks like it  Especially with that shaved head dude  Whatever it is  Yeah  It seems like because they can't get at their girls  Or the guys that are with their girls  That the aggression is going to be taken out on people like the camera crew 
[00:09:30]  And uh  Other people that are working there  I could see that shaved head guy punching one of the camera guys  Yeah I'm sure after the two weeks  The guys and the girls that were brought in to tempt these couples  They're going to be long gone when the couples finally reunite  Yeah  Oh yeah I can imagine that happening  It's not like they're going to have one big happy little uh barbecue with everyone  Before they leave the island  No  I think there's going to be some kind of surprises too  That they throw in like maybe uh  Maybe midway through 
[00:10:00]  One of the guys is going to be able to see his girl  If he does something  You know what I mean  Yeah  Some kind of a challenge where  You win an opportunity to uh  Be with your girl  Yeah right  Maybe one night  And catch whatever she caught  Yeah right  All right  Listen guys  I know this doesn't have to do with Temptation Island  Yeah  Do you mind if I mention it  What do you got  Um  I had  I called up the other day  Because I had an idea of a way to win uh  Take the tickets to New Orleans  Yeah  Yeah  Um  They said they'd get back  Ah

[00:25:00]  Where they would strip  And we would videotape them  Washing all this gunk  Off of each other  And let me tell you  This was before  We had a website  Yeah  Just for our own  Private collection  This was our own  Private collection  See nowadays  We have excuses  Ah we just need  A little video  For our website  Website vid  Back then we had  No excuses  It was just  Videotaping  Girls showering  And then you get  Things like  You know  Aren't you gonna  Join us  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no  Oh no

[00:28:00]  Yeah  Obviously  This will rear its ugly head  On our show  In the coming weeks  Every week  We have to do a little update  Alright why don't we get ready  For the Stalker Patty  And Annoying Laugh Anthony show  Yeah  And I know a lot of people  Just getting out of work  And they're just tuning in  The show for the first time  You want to give a quick update  Well  As far as the Annoying Laugh Anthony  Nightmare  Annoying Laugh Anthony  Came in  I guess to collect a bet  Debt  From Stinky  And of course  Like always  He comes in and sits down  And 
[00:28:30]  Today more than ever  He just showed himself  As being  The guy he is  In craving attention  This guy needs attention  So bad  He needs to be accepted  By this show  He said certain things like  Oh you know  You guys always hang out  You know you go to the  Jay Moore things  And no one ever takes me  And he sounded very  Very lonely  So we tried to get him  A Big Brother  We really did  We called the  Big Brother organization  They didn't want it  To come on the air  But we were really going to  Try to get him a pal  That could take him  Like ice skating  At Rockefeller Center  Maybe take him to 
[00:29:00]  New Jersey Nets game  You know  And he likes his air time  Spend the  You know  A weekend  Day together  Yeah  He loves his air time  Here  And then Stalker Patty  Called up  Right  And she's upstairs  Per usual  And she's another one  Always you know  Craving the attention  Craving the acceptance  So all of a sudden  Light bulbs  Bing  Bing  I'm thinking  Wow  Two pathetic souls  What do we do  In the building  At the same time  We're short  A couple of air shifts  Here  At any W  Why not give them  15 minutes 
[00:29:30]  On the air  During prime time  Prime time  This is it  This is prime time  On the number one  Rated afternoon show  Here in New York City  I mean  You couldn't ask for more  There are people  That have been in radio  For their entire careers  That would dream  Of a moment  Like this  Right  We're handing it over  To Anthony and Patty  Right  And we're going to give them  15 minutes  We're not going to say a thing  No  We will not interfere  If they get tripped up  They're going to have to  Get through it themselves 
[00:30:00]  They have been show prepping  Out there  Yes they have  Clipping out newspaper articles  Anthony has  The Gettysburg Address  Written down on  Various papers  Right  He's been writing  I think it's going to  Sound a little scripted  Right  But it's okay  It will just be them  And I don't want  To influence our listeners  I'm not even going to say a word  I'm not going to say  You should do this  Or that  Or whatever  We're just going to  We're just going to  Hand over the show to them  Handle this show  The Anthony and Stalker Patty show  However way you want  Like you would  Well let me just say  I'm just going to say

[01:24:00]  At a strip club in Winona  Wow  I don't know  When you gotta work your way up  From Winona  All the way to  One of the bigger cities  Good God  Some of the strip clubs here  In New York City  Have sloppy talent  Can you imagine  What would you say  The percentage of  Black people are  In Winona  Of the population  Um  Sixty percent  Sixty percent black  Maybe that's a little bit much  It's  What do the kids do  For entertainment  You drive around 
[01:24:30]  In a circle  You make the circuit  You park at Sonic  But you have to park  On the cool side  Alright wait wait wait  What's Sonic  So they just drive  Yeah Sonic is like  Um  The hedgehog  No  Not the hedgehog  It's a restaurant  It's a  It's a drive  It's a  It's a drive-in restaurant  Like the kind you  That normally used to wear  The roller skates  You know  Oh right  One of those  Yeah  There you go  Oh great 
[01:25:00]  So they park there  They drive around  With their cars  That they've been working on  Yeah  No  Now look  We're not all rednecks  No I know  I'm just saying  Usually kids  Like to work on their cars  And then show them off  By driving around  They do that up here too  Oh okay  Out on Long Island  It's called  Babylon Speedway  They just drive around  In big circles  That's about it  Well you drive around  The Sonic  Down Highway 51  Turn on Summit Street  Make the loop  Go all the way back  And you do it again 
[01:25:30]  And again  And again  And again  And again  It was that way  When I was in high school  And it still is today  That sounds like fun  And don't you do it  You do that circuit  Over and over  And over again  And pray to God  That someone takes you out  With some of that  Good old snipe hunting  Hey Jimmy  Please hit me on the head  With a 2x4  Good God  So now  Is it very  Integrated  I mean  Or are the kids  Do they segregate  Black and white  Since it's like 
[01:26:00]  They segregate  It's very segregated  But it's  It's just as much  Susie  Yeah  Do you want us to  Take you to New York  When we're down there  Yeah  Take me to New York  Like forever  Just get  Get me out of here  Get you the hell out of here  Get me out of here  Please  We'll put you in one of our houses  There you go  I don't know  I'm afraid  Now  Now  I'd like to touch a little more  On this issue  Because I'm trying to get a feel  For the town  Yeah  You're saying  It's probably 50-50 
[01:26:30]  Black and white  Yeah  Now  Is there a section  Of Winona  That is black  Yes  And do a lot of white people  Venture into the black  Well you have to  It's actually  The main highway  Goes right through it  So  Right through it  And that's where you  Slap the locks down  And roll the windows up  Right  It's really not bad  Is there some crime  In Winona  Our crime rates  Are very low  Very low  All right  So that means  They're afraid  Always 
[01:27:00]  Always  So  Stinky  Maybe  You could try  Maybe going into the black section  Yeah  I was going to say  Out there  That's probably going to have  More fun things  I think there might be  Some bars in the black section  At least  At least some music  Some music  Yeah  Get to check out  Some of those  Those blues  Yeah  Maybe some blues  Maybe there's a blues club there  Anything like that  If there are  I'm not aware of it  All right  I don't know  Well Anthony 
[01:27:30]  We got to make our decision here  Yeah  Well you know  It's all there is  I have no more  Do you want Stinky to come  Susie  Sure  He'll leave like  Monday afternoon  She'll get down there  By Wednesday morning  Sure  We'll chronicle his journey  Yeah  All the way there  Maybe stopping off  At a couple of spots quickly  To look at some history  Or something on the route there  And then  Once he gets there  He will  Tour Winona  Well  I certainly wouldn't want 
[01:28:00]  Stinky to be disappointed  Oh I won't  And you'll be his tour guide  Sure  Maybe put him on  The little morning show  You got down there  The Tim Him and Her show  Sure  But we'll have to do  Some education beforehand  To make sure he doesn't  Say anything inappropriate  Anything  Could be  You know  Really bad  Right  I guess  I take it  You have no delay  No we have no delay  We rarely ever  Take phone calls live  Oh you do a lot of taped calls  We just  We have a mini disc  And we do that  It's just

[01:45:30]  Now he's  We're both spanking it  Right  Yeah  Talk a little more in code  Because I don't want them dumping out  Basically at this point  We're both hitchhiking  We're both hitchhiking  Both of you guys are hitchhiking  And she's sitting in the middle of us  Okay  And she's helping us hitchhike  Right  And then we're doing  And all of a sudden  She gets up and leaves the bed  Uh oh  So now me and Norton  Are hitchhiking  And we're looking at each other  I'm gay  Oh no  I am gay  You hear that everyone  I'm gay  Wait wait wait  I don't even know
