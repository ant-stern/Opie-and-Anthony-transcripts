<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Larry King's humorous introduction before launching into a blistering critique of the Republican presidential debate.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, unleashed a torrent of highly offensive language targeting Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Michelle Bachmann, Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich, and Herman Cain.  Their pre-show conversation was revealed, which included jokes about Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow.  Ron Paul's unconventional views, especially on evolution and Afghanistan/Iraq air conditioning costs, received significant, mocking attention.  A lengthy, extremely vulgar segment followed, focused on Al Sharpton's MSNBC post-debate appearance and a graphic news story about a weatherman, Brett Cummins, found dead beside a naked man in a bathtub.  Extensive, crude speculation about the events surrounding Cumminsâ€™ death dominated the discussion, punctuated by explicit jokes. The debate's candidate placement and unfairness were revisited before returning to the weatherman story.

Patton Oswalt then joined the show in studio. After a brief mention of the previous local news story segment, the conversation veered into a racially charged discussion of Barack Obama's election, including a host's threat to give money to the KKK.  This transitioned into a song about "Dennyville Highway," followed by discussions of Shane MacGowan's teeth, the final episode of *Rescue Me*, TV binging, absurd safety warnings,  memories of a Mr. Yuck campaign (with off-color references to molestation), and outrageous radio stunts, including Danny Bonaduce's Rohypnol experiment.  Oswalt's upcoming projects (*Finest Hour* and an album) were mentioned before a lengthy discussion on the nature of success (involving Michael Jordan, Richard Pryor, and others), ruthlessness in effective presidents, reading habits, masturbation, and Oswalt's theory on the effects of drugs and alcohol (using Winston Churchill as an example).

A further segment, featuring Oswalt,  began with a debate on equality and its limitations.  The discussion transitioned to the effects of alcohol, driving under the influence, and the heightened focus while intoxicated but fearful of being caught.  Hypotheticals on radio song-caused deaths were posited. The conversation shifted to the presidential debates, analyzing candidate stiffness and anxieties, contrasting them with the more relaxed performances of candidates with slim chances.  Al Sharpton's political strategy and the media's double standard in portraying him versus David Duke were discussed, along with coded racial language in politics and criticism of the Tea Party.  The difficulties of addressing controversial issues like evolution were likened to navigating a laser grid.  Oswalt's career was further discussed, and Jim Norton joined, sharing anecdotes including his *Seinfeld* appearance and an uncomfortable USO trip to Iraq.  Jesse Ventura's views, *MASH*'s humor (specifically Frank Burns), *Hogan's Heroes*' depiction of Nazis, and the eventual romanticization of 9/11 were discussed before concluding with a detailed, humorous account of Nick Swardson's *Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star*, including prosthetic genitalia. Absurd news teases were interspersed throughout.

The next segment began with a discussion of *Lost Boys*, quickly segueing into a comedic brainstorm for a ludicrous gay porno film about the Cuban Missile Crisis, filled with graphic depictions of gay sex intertwined with historical events. Explicit descriptions of male genitalia and sexual acts were frequent.  Kevin Smith called in, shifting the conversation to *Red State*, its marketing, Michael Parks' performance, and Smith's filmmaking.  Smith also mentioned *Hit Somebody*.  Patton Oswalt and Nick Swardson were present in studio.  A fictional movie concept involving a man in white spandex and an erection was also humorously discussed.

A further segment featured Kevin Smith's phone call to discuss his two-part film "Hit Somebody" ("Home" and "Away"), mentioning John Goodman and a vomiting goalie cameo. Nick Swardson briefly joined for promotion before leaving.  Patton Oswalt promoted his Showtime special and album.  A significant portion was dedicated to an interview with WWE's Zack Ryder, discussing his YouTube success ("The True Long Island Story"), catchphrase, success on Raw, action figure collection, music preferences (Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block), and dating life.  The show concluded with a heated, sexually charged exchange between former intern Francine and a co-worker, Troy, ending abruptly with Francine leaving the studio.  The hosts wrapped up, promoting the next show with Jim Breuer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  What am I doing here? 
[00:03:30]  Wait a minute.  You want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You got it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah!  This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on that, man.  Yeah, a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened  to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  The show is so disorganized. 
[00:04:00]  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying this.  Well, then turn off.  God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts.  We already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one  of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Good morning.  How's everybody today? 
[00:04:30]  Hola.  What happened?  My headphone.  There it is.  Nice.  Yeah, you know, you got the master one.  You got the master headphone one over there.  What, this one?  This one over here?  Oh, but then I'll just turn mine down.  And then I got to get to mine and adjust it perfectly.  Uh, well, me and Ant just did 20 minutes on the Republican debate.  Yes, the debate, the after debate. 
[00:05:00]  So try to capture that in the air somewhere, because it's out there.  Yeah.  How was the debate?  We weren't recording it, were we?  Uh, no idea.  I don't think so.  Nope.  I didn't see any tape rolling.  So how are they going to hear what we said?  Uh.  I don't like doing things twice.  Maybe we shouldn't talk before the show.  Me neither.  I think we got to start showing up right at six, Sam.  Like Ronnie B.  Yeah, because the problem is me and Ant are doing our best material.  Jimmy shows up at six.  Right, walk right in.  So look, he's nice and fresh.  He doesn't even know what we talked about. 
[00:05:30]  I know.  And then me and Ant have to make believe all the shit we just said for the last 20 minutes  is being said for the first time to each other.  But you'll know if it works amongst your conversation before the show, we'll just do that again.  Are you trying to say we were trying things out?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, I see.  Spitballing is what they call it.  Oh, we were talking about Al Sharpton, how Rachel Maddow looks like a boy.  Right.  That's an old gag, but still fun.  We were talking about Romney and Perry and Michelle Bachman and the rest of these clowns. 
[00:06:00]  Did they let Ron Paul debate?  Yeah.  Yeah, Ron Paul is a lunatic.  Me and Ant are in agreement.  Enough with the Ron Paul tweets and emails.  I've seen so many of them.  Ron Paul is a lunatic.  I've seen them all.  You know, he's got some good ideas.  I do agree with that.  He's a very good businessman.  And now I'm going to get all the tweets going, you know nothing about politics.  Shut up, because I don't agree with you.  Doesn't mean I don't know anything about politics.  He's got some great shit as far as finances go for this country to get back again.  But the guy, boy, is he not very presidential. 
[00:06:30]  And I don't think he's electable this time around either.  I think, and here's what I believe.  It's not, I'm not saying this is what's going to happen, but here's what I believe.  I think we're looking at a Perry Romney ticket for 2012.  I'm not sure which way it's going to go as far as president, vice president.  But I think the Republicans, and if they're smart, they're going to run two middle-aged looking white guys with sort of moderate ideology on some things. 
[00:07:00]  Yes, they're religious.  But when you look at how religious George Bush was, anything is a pullback.  And at this point, and again, my opinion, anything, especially business-wise, would be better than Barack Obama at this point.  They had them front and center also.  And then as the candidates spread out on the stage, you notice the peripheral people barely got any time, any camera time. 
[00:07:30]  That fucking Michelle Bach.  She's on the side.  No one gives a shit.  She said three words.  They were saying she was hanging low, but I told Ant that she's out of her league.  It's now being made apparent that she's completely out of her league, and she has no shot at this.  She doesn't have a shot.  Yeah, the fat spittle guy from Dune, I don't think he's got a shot.  Oh, Newt Gingrich, yes, that's what his name was. 
[00:08:00]  But the point I was making to you, Ant, the Romney-Perry thing, and they do it at every debate leading up to every fucking election.  These guys are fighting with each other.  Perry and Romney basically saying, you suck, I'm better.  No, I'm better.  You suck.  And then two, three months from now, whatever, they're going to be best of pals.  When they're running mates, they're going to be talking about how great each other are.  They bash the shit out of each other in the primaries, just like Obama did.  No, I know.  I know it's not just a...  It happens on both sides. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Obama and Biden were going at it during these debates.  Yeah, they were going at it during the primaries.  And then they turned out to be palsy-wowsies.  And that's what drives me nuts.  We're supposed to forget all this shit that's happening now, where who said Dukakis created more jobs than you, sir?  More jobs than you did.  Yeah, Romney gets that off.  And then Perry comes back with, you know, well, George W. Bush had more jobs than you, and then nobody didn't. 
[00:09:00]  They were just arguing.  But them's fighting words.  If you say Dukakis created more jobs than you, no one wants to hear that.  Got some laughs.  I know, but eventually...  Anytime you say Dukakis, it gets laughs.  Eventually, they'll be pals, and they'll get past the Dukakis thing.  And you're right.  One will run as the other one's vice presidential candidate after attacking each other.  It really is hard.  I hate the process.  It's hard to believe anything any of them say.  I love this.  Actually, Obama is Bush's third term. 
[00:09:30]  Shut the fuck up, you fucking cunt.  You're an asshole.  Really?  I'm going to randomly block someone on Twitter for that, because that's just too much fun right there.  It's just...  For people to say, look, he's been in long enough to make the presidency his own.  His transparency in government, all of the promises he made, his delusions of grandeur, they never panned out. 
[00:10:00]  And it's time to stop blaming Bush.  There's plenty to blame Bush about.  He had two terms.  He fucked up shit.  He got us in wars we shouldn't have been in in the first place.  He spent so much money on these wars.  It was ludicrous.  You've got to look at some of the circumstances that were happening at the time.  He had the public behind him, especially after 9-11.  The public was rabid about going anywhere and bombing the shit out of anyone.  We were pissed off people looking for blood. 
[00:10:30]  In hindsight, wasn't quite the right thing to do.  A lot of people realized that.  We went through a lot of money, and it hurt the economy.  But let me tell you something.  We're still in Afghanistan.  We're still in Iraq.  We're also now in fucking Libya.  Gitmo's still open.  We've bailed out a fuckload of fucking people that should have gone under.  And this guy, now tonight, Obama's going to get on TV and talk about how he's going to get jobs  by putting to work people on the infrastructure of America. 
[00:11:00]  You know, highways and things.  Where have I heard this?  Oh, that's right.  It was part of his election speech.  This isn't a new fucking idea.  Holy shit.  Wow, you're losing your mind.  He's rehashing.  Well, enough.  I fucking, I'm done with Obama.  I'm done with his bullshit about everything that he said he was going to do. 
[00:11:30]  Which, by the way, I'm kind of happy about on a lot of things.  And it's time to get two middle-aged white guys in there again.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You mentioned Libya on Twitter today.  Qaddafi to haters.  He's got haters, you know.  We all have haters.  They do H8?  Yeah.  Are they spelling haters that way?  The cool Twitter way to save some letters?  Qaddafi to haters.  Yeah.  And we can all relate.  We all have haters.  Yeah.  Qaddafi to haters.  You're all scumbags. 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  He wrote that?  Yeah.  Qaddafi's tweeting.  Qaddafi rules.  I wish he was tweeting.  That's cool.  Ah, well, the process has begun for the next president of the United States of America.  Do we have any clips from the debate?  I would love to play a few of these today.  Do you have the blah-de-blah-de-blah one or the blah-blah-blah-de-blah one?  I mean, there was that moment, that little trade-off between Perry and Romney.  It was the after debate on MSNBC where they got such credible people to sit down and debate about the debate. 
[00:12:30]  The likes of which, oh, Reverend Al Sharpton.  They invite that fucking piece of shit onto MSNBC to talk about what â€“ this is that fat fuck that Stephen Bagonis lost his entire career and life over, pretty much.  Because that cocksucker backed two lying sacks of shit lawyers, Mason and Maddox, over the Tawana-Brawley lie. 
[00:13:00]  And they invite him on now?  What, were they doing the roundtable thing that MSNBC does?  Of course.  Yeah, I don't understand why MSNBC would have â€“  This lump of shit.  Would have hired Reverend Al.  I'm just amazed by that.  Say what you want about any other news organization, but MSNBC brings this fat fuck on and gives them credibility.  When, in the meantime, you know, you don't see â€“ what's his name? 
[00:13:30]  The former head of the KKK there.  That's a nice politician now.  Kumia.  Yes, yes, him.  David Duke.  David Duke.  You don't see David Duke being brought on any other news channels as a legitimate guy.  You see him brought on as that kooky guy.  But you know what?  Hey, David Duke is just trying to make his way in life now.  Oh, he was the Grand Wizard at one point of the KKK, but that was a long time ago.  So why don't they bring him on as a roundtable thing? 
[00:14:00]  You got a race-baiting shit fuck like Reverend Al Sharpton sitting there and getting credibility by MSNBC?  Fuck you.  Fuck your channel.  Fuck Reverend Al.  Let me ask you a question.  I don't know why they would do that.  Because they're liberal cocksuckers that forgot everything that happened back in the fucking 80s.  But if they're liberal cocksuckers, they could find a bunch of people way better than Reverend Al.  Yeah.  Reverend Al just alienates.  They love him.  But he alienates way too many people.  Oh, they love him. 
[00:14:30]  How was his ratings for that show?  Are they out yet?  I don't know.  No idea.  When they line up these candidates, with Democrats and Republicans, do they line them up in alphabetical order at the thing?  Or do they put the ones who look the most prestigious, who they're telling you should be the ticket in the middle?  Frontrunners are centered.  But why don't they just line them up alphabetically if it's really a debate between the candidates for that party?  Yeah.  Why do you need the frontrunners?  Why do you have to stack the deck even more?  So the cameras don't have to swing so much?  They're already telling us basically who we should be focusing on. 
[00:15:00]  Of course, yeah.  When in this country of ours, it should be a throw-up, right?  That's exactly what it is.  It's this kind of subliminal thing that goes on.  Front and center.  Who picks the positioning?  You got your frontrunners.  Do you know?  I don't know.  Is it the network?  Good question.  Who picks the position?  I doubt the network does it.  Positions for everybody.  It's like a horse race.  Yeah.  Putting everyone in their proper place.  It should just be alphabetical.  And everybody gets the same amount of time to talk. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, how else could you, if that way you hear every candidate the same?  If I was in charge of it, I would make them all stand like they do, but no podiums.  And then they have to wander around the stage the entire time.  Oh, that'd be good.  If you stop moving, you're out.  Musical microphones.  And who got the podium fucking gig?  Yeah.  Remember, we talked about podiums.  Podiums make you look very important.  They ought to do that.  Musical microphones where they ask questions and then they take away one microphone and  they all have to run to a mic to answer the question. 
[00:16:00]  Newt didn't get good placement last night.  Newt got horrid placement.  Newt stinks.  Because he's, yeah, he rots.  Bachman got a horrible placement.  He sucks, too.  Yeah, they all suck.  What's his name?  Who's the black guy in there?  There's a black guy up there.  Yeah.  He actually had some good ideas.  I liked his ideas on taxes.  Those were good.  What's his name, though?  The black guy.  I didn't know there was a black Republican.  I just call him the black guy.  Yeah, because you know he's the black Republican, so he's the only one.  But I like some of his... 
[00:16:30]  What did Ron Paul say about air conditioners?  Ron Paul's crazy.  What did he say about air conditioners?  Do we have that clip?  We should have that clip today.  Yeah, we should get that clip.  Something about take the air conditioners away from our soldiers or something.  You didn't hear this?  I must have been listening with half an ear at that air conditioner line.  I don't want to misquote it.  So we've got to find the air conditioner line.  The economic stuff.  Like, Ron Paul, one thing I liked...  Here's what I liked about him.  He is a kook, don't you?  I think he is a little nutty. 
[00:17:00]  What I liked about him was he answered everything.  I didn't watch him last night, but the different things I've seen him in, he answers questions directly.  Like, what do you think we should do with the economy?  He doesn't give you a bullshit about, well, this is what I think we should do.  And he gives you a real answer whether you like it or not.  Yeah.  I don't like his stance on evolution, which means I wouldn't like his stance on a lot of science.  Even though people keep saying he wouldn't legislate.  Maybe not.  I just don't like that.  Yeah.  And to me, that is an important issue.  I didn't like it in Bush.  It was too religious.  What does he believe as far as evolution goes?  Creationism. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know what I don't like?  Obama hides it very well.  He's not pushing a religious agenda.  But he sure as shit is coddling the Muslims.  And not so much when it comes to Christians and Catholics and Jews.  The Muslims.  His stance he's taken against Israel is amazing.  Whether you like it or not, I mean, you know, they are pretty much the only checkmark we got over there.  He's going for the Muslim vote.  Of course he is.  There's a lot of Muslims in America. 
[00:18:00]  And of course he is.  You're absolutely right.  You want to see the Ron Paul clip?  Yeah, let's see Ron Paul with his air conditioner.  Listen to this.  The Blaze.  Ron Paul.  Just back from the wildfires out east in Category 1 storm laid waste to entire areas.  There's standing water tonight, Patterson, New Jersey.  Many of the towns around where I live, eight days without power.  We had people eating in outdoor and public parks because the supermarkets were closed down. 
[00:18:30]  The question is, federal aid, something like FEMA, if you object to what it's become and how it's run, your position is to remove it.  Take it away, abolish it.  What happens in its absence?  Well, what happened before 1979?  We didn't have FEMA.  And FEMA just conditioned people to build where they shouldn't be building.  We lose the market effect of that.  But, yeah, my position is we should have never had it.  There's a much better way of doing it.  I mean, this whole idea that the federal government can deal with weather and anything in the world. 
[00:19:00]  Just go to the federal government.  FEMA's broke.  They're $20 billion in debt.  But I'm not foresaying tomorrow, close it down.  A lot of people pay the insurance.  I work real hard to make it work, and I did that in my district, too.  But I'll tell you how we should do it.  We're spending, believe it or not, this blew my mind when I read this, $20 billion a year for air conditioning in Afghanistan and Iraq in the tents over there and all the air conditioning.  Cut that $20 billion out, bring it home, take $10 off the debt, and put $10 into FEMA or whoever else needs it, child health care or whatever. 
[00:19:30]  But I'll tell you what, if we did that and took the air conditioning out of the green zone, our troops would come home, and that would make me happy.  Now, how is it that you take the air conditioners away from the soldiers and they just come home?  Well, they get too hot.  They get too hot and they start going, hey, I'm out of here.  We all can relate to that.  After a while, you just go, oh, fuck this.  I'm out of here.  Well, the problem is, why is it costing $20 billion for air conditioners? 
[00:20:00]  That's the real issue.  Because it's the government.  Right.  I'm sure it shouldn't cost $20 billion for air conditioners.  You go to Afghanistan Sears, you pick up a couple of units, window units.  It's easy.  Our guys need air conditioners, but it shouldn't cost $20 billion.  He wants to bring them all home.  I think that's the point he's making.  Boy, that's a roundabout way to make that point.  Yeah, but he said our soldier would come home and that would make me happy.  And I like the way he's like, let's cut this here, put 10 here, 10 there. 
[00:20:30]  What about the guys that go, you know what?  Fuck the air conditioners.  I'm staying anyway.  Yeah.  Then how do you get those guys out?  Yeah.  What happened?  They like the heat.  Heat blowers on them.  Right.  Hey, Mars, what's going on with the blank screens?  Oh, boy.  We just lost all our TVs.  And by that, we mean the two eyes.  You just want to make sure you weren't having a fucking stroke or something.  He wants to pull every soldier out of Germany.  I love that.  I want all our soldiers out of everywhere in the world.  Korea, I like that about him.  We kind of need him around.  He has some great ideas, but he's a little kooky is all I'm saying. 
[00:21:00]  You should give his ideas to someone that looks more presidential.  It's like there was somebody on this earth at one point that had a great idea on building  interstate highways.  Now, most of the world had roads.  So this guy thought, you know, huge highways and then have roads off these highways would  make travel a lot easier.  It's a great idea.  That sounds like a great man.  But the elimination of an entire race of people, probably not as popular as that highway idea. 
[00:21:30]  That was just Hitler's idea of how to keep traffic.  That's all the Holocaust is about.  Hitler wanted traffic on these new highways to be light.  Light traffic.  So he figured if he wiped out six million people, nobody would be going to work.  You want to talk to Oscar, who knows about air conditioners?  Oscar.  Oscar.  He knows exactly what Ron Paul's talking about.  Oscar, go ahead real fast.  I know about air conditions, too, my friend.  That's right.  We all do.  What's going on?  All right.  No, I did a first rotation tour in Iraq, and we did it without air conditioners when I 
[00:22:00]  was there.  This is spring 2004.  We're leaving.  Everybody that moved in started buying fucking air conditioners and installing them in the  palaces and shit.  And I agree with Ron Paul.  It's bullshit.  Them motherfuckers, they can suffer like we did.  Look, I would love to know who got that gig, the air conditioners for over there.  That's a lot of fucking money, man.  Oh, so it's like the electric bill?  Like, if they're buying them on their own and installing them into, like, tents and buildings. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, who pays for the electric if you're over there fighting and you're like, you know  what, I need an air conditioner for my little area.  Well, it's got to be the government, whatever they're setting up, whatever power plants they  have at all.  I think...  $20 billion for air conditioners.  That's crazy.  We frayed a bunch of wires and made a big hook out of it and threw it up on the electric  line.  That's what they do, just steal your juice.  I love it.  That's good.  All right, Oscar.  I'm wrong with that.  Thank you, sir.  And thanks for everything you do for this country.  Hey, Herman Cain is the CEO of Godfather Pizza. 
[00:23:00]  Is that true?  The black guy.  That's Herman Cain.  Oh, is that it?  I'm getting intel.  Yeah.  And he's the CEO of Godfather's Pizza.  Oh, there he is.  Cain in 2012, yo's.  Man, he has no shot.  Oh, not a chance in hell.  No shot.  No.  Do they give them an equal number of time to talk?  Well, they're supposed to.  I think they kind of turn their mics down a little lower and stuff. 
[00:23:30]  Some people, if they're asked a question and then they give shenanigans to another candidate,  the other candidate gives an opportunity, gets an opportunity to kind of rebut that.  And if no one's talking to one candidate, they don't get as much chance to talk.  What were they saying about the death penalty?  Weren't they going back and forth about the death penalty, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Perry is a big fan of the death penalty, being in Texas and everything like that.  And, again, MSNBC was like, you know, it's just appalling to me to see somebody and people 
[00:24:00]  actually applauding the killing of other people.  I was like, really?  Really?  What about the people that killed the people that are, because that's what you're talking  about.  They've killed other people.  So shut up.  Making it sound like they're just cheering about, yay, kill people.  Yay.  You're applauding the fact that you feel that justice is being given.  I don't even like the death penalty, but it's not.  Of course.  I was thinking about those two that killed that doctor and his family.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  On the way in today.  Right.  I would applaud those two being burned alive.  Oh, exactly.  They should be killed.  That's a Connecticut thing.  Yeah.  It's the worst thing I've ever heard.  They should be burned alive.  You know, that whole MSNBC and the slogan that they have, lean forward, because everything  they say is right-leaning or left-leaning, they're like, we lean forward.  Let's just lean forward.  And I tweeted it last night, I'm like, lean forward, yeah, over my toilet bowl.  That's what I do.  As I vomit, it should be, yeah, it should be MSNBC, hold my hair. 
[00:25:00]  I had it with lean forward.  Shut up.  Aren't you vomiting for other reasons, sir?  Well, sometimes, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I do that sometimes.  Captain Morgan, lean forward.  Captain Morgan, bathroom tile marks on my face.  Well, I have a fucking debate.  That was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's just all silly.  It's...  In the end.  So the frontrunners, Romney and Perry.  That's what I'm looking at. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  Who's third and fourth place right now?  Third and fourth.  Pretty good.  Who's up there?  Pretty good.  I think a lot of people do like...  Who doesn't have a chance?  I think a lot of people do like Ron Paul.  Bachman doesn't have a shot.  What about the weird guy that looks like a kid toucher?  What's his name?  Yeah, he kind of popped his head in there, and he actually got some pretty good things  to say.  They kind of like him, but they're saying, you know, a little too green.  Maybe another four years, he might have a better shot at this.  What's his name, though?  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  Starts with an H.  Fuck.  Uh.  Fuck.  Hamna, Hamna.  The guy all the way on the right there.  Hamna, Hamna, Hamna.  That guy.  Yeah, what's his name there?  What the fuck is his name?  Just the way they stack the frontrunners in the middle.  Of course.  I'm waiting for someone to come up with it.  What a rigged game, man.  It is.  That's the political process in this country.  It's fair for everybody.  Harkonnen.  First of all, you need millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of  dollars to even have a chance at it.  Huntsman.  Huntsman.  Thank you.  I believe it's Huntsman, yes.  Thank you. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, Huntsman.  They kind of liked him, but he's got a weird look to him.  Well, yeah, he does kind of have a younger Gary Condit weird guy look.  Herman Cain, no way.  You got the Ron Paul, Romney, Perry, Buckman, Newt.  Who are the other two that were up there?  Do you even know?  No, I don't pay attention to a few of the people.  They just, eh, whatever.  Let me ask you this.  Did Clinton come out of nowhere or was he a frontrunner?  I don't remember anymore. 
[00:27:00]  At the beginning, he was kind of a peripheral guy.  He was, right?  But he was what they call charmings.  And moved up in the ranks.  Had charisma.  Who were the frontrunners that year?  Fuck, who was it?  Because I have a feeling that Clinton just came out of nowhere.  I'm wondering if any one of these guys could come out of nowhere.  Was that 92?  Clinton got elected?  92, sure.  Was Dukakis, I think he was from, was Dukakis from Boston?  Oh, yeah, he was.  Barry Brown, Paul Slongus.  Remember Paul Slongus?  Yeah.  Were those guys the frontrunners that year?  They were in it.  But who were the guys that people were really focused on before Clinton came out of nowhere? 
[00:27:30]  Or maybe Clinton was a frontrunner.  I don't remember.  I don't think he was, though.  I mean, they weren't doing that well in education.  Barry Brown.  Looks like it's from a very impressive place.  Longus.  Who are the others to, uh...  I don't know now.  Bob Carey, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Carey, shit.  Turn up, one second, so you can see the last guy here.  Carey was probably the frontrunner.  Tom Harkin, okay.  Yeah, well, you know, Clinton was the guy.  Well, we now know that, but...  Yeah.  Until he played his saxophone, we didn't know who the fuck this guy was. 
[00:28:00]  I know.  That's what he did.  He went on the MTV.  Arsenio.  Arsenio.  Arsenio.  Yeah, he did that, though.  He went on the MTV, too, and got the...  The MTV.  He went on the MTV and got the Boxers or Briefs question and laughed and got every young vote.  What did he say?  Did he say Boxers or Briefs?  I think he said he goes commando and comes all over interns' dresses, and they all laughed  and thought it was a joke.  See, Harry probably said he was naked or something. 
[00:28:30]  Exactly, Chip.  You got it.  Is that how you handle it now?  Yeah.  That's how you handle it, Al.  Exactly.  When fucking...  When Reverend Al blurted out Galio instead of Galileo, I...  Galio.  I think twice he said it, too.  He's a moron.  That's what he is.  He's Ugaleo.  Ugaleo.  Ugaleo.  Gary Hart, people are saying, was a frontrunner? 
[00:29:00]  Was he then?  Was he before the monkey business?  Before the monkey business thing?  Yeah, that was a good one.  And Ross Perot, people are saying Ross Perot is...  He was in there all the time, independent, pain in the ass, fucking spoiler.  I hope Ron Paul isn't going to pull that shit.  Once we get viable candidates up there through this primary...  Yeah, everyone else just has to back him and pull the fuck out, or else you're going  to take away Republican votes and this jackass is going to get another four fucking years. 
[00:29:30]  I might vote for Ron Paul.  I don't know.  It's a throwaway of a vote.  I don't care.  And it's a vote for fucking Obama.  There's a lot that I don't like about his stuff, but I do like his economic...  I think he knows what he's talking about.  I think he knows that process.  He's a little too old.  Yeah.  I don't like somebody that old getting elected.  And that...  Anybody who's like that bugs me.  But you're going to vote for him anyway?  You're confusing. 
[00:30:00]  No, because the point is, that's not really an issue in politics right now.  Right.  Like, it's not an important issue.  Like, it's not like because he's a creationist, he's going to fucking not do the right thing  tax-wise.  Yeah.  I'm undecided with him.  Ron Paul, a lot of Ron Paul, I know you guys are passionate, but a lot of you really  are annoying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, when you say, like, you're not sure, they're like, but he didn't say that!  I know.  I'm just telling you, I'm not sure you fuck.  Shut up.  Stand the Ron Paul.  Yes, whole people.  Like, Ron Paul, like I said, he's got some good ideas, a little kooky.  I don't mind Ron Paul. 
[00:30:30]  It's his people that are crazy.  But you're missing the point, Jimmy.  You think people just overreact all the time?  All the time.  It's like, I said some good things about him.  Like, I like the fact that he answers directly and stuff, and then they're like, fucking,  it's like, if you don't get 100% on board, I'm like, yeah, but I don't like that he's  a creationist, though.  Yeah, but that's not going to affect anything!  All right, asshole.  Good.  Sorry.  Sorry I didn't say that.  Yes, I think that's a repulsive point of view, and I love him anyway.  Sorry.  Shut your face.  At least I'm saying something good about the guy.  I'm being open. 
[00:31:00]  Hocksuckers.  Nothing wrong with being open.  Really?  Like, I'm taking a look at him, I'm watching some of the things he's saying, and a lot  of what he's saying I like.  Right.  But there's that other part that I don't like.  And they attack you for that.  Fuck them!  I know they're passionate, and the problem is, they're like, nobody will talk about Ron  Paul!  No, that's why, you idiots!  Because whatever we do, you fucking, you jump on the one minutiae that we're not 100% with  Ron Paul.  That's why nobody wants to talk about him.  It's so right.  Because you guys are annoying.  You're so fucking right.  Of course I'm right! 
[00:31:30]  Oh, God.  I was tweeting nice stuff about him.  Yeah.  And still getting attacked, right?  And still!  You know?  But he didn't say evolution!  Great!  I'm sure he didn't.  Shut up!  He didn't say Jesus was riding a dinosaur.  That made me laugh out loud when a guy wrote that.  Yeah.  That is a funny one.  But the guy raised a good point.  He goes, who cares if Ron Paul thinks Jesus was riding a dinosaur?  He can fuck my mother as long as he can fix the country?  Fix the country.  Yeah, that's awesome.  And that's a great point.  Yeah, that is funny.  Clinton got in the race in November, supposedly.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  So like a year.  A year before. 
[00:32:00]  Well, yeah.  Well, alright.  So a couple months later.  Something like that.  From where we're at now, right?  Yeah.  That's when people got into it.  Like a year before the race.  Now it's over a year and a half before.  You start.  People.  The rumblings start happening.  And that's what bothers me, too.  Because now you got a President Obama.  Love him or hate him.  Whatever.  But now he can't even focus on the country.  Because he has to focus on his re-election.  A president now serves two and a half years.  Abso-fucking-lady. 
[00:32:30]  And then campaigns for a year and a half.  And it works on both sides.  Yeah.  You know, the next president, if he's a fucking Republican.  It'll do the exact same fucking thing.  It'll be two years as president.  And then two years of campaigning.  Shouldn't there be some kind of laws in there where, look, you already have a gig.  Yeah.  Do your gig.  Sorry, but you can't focus on, you know, making sure you continue with your gig right  now.  I'm waiting for the day where the president gets sworn in and then starts making campaign  promises for his next election.  He hops on a bus and goes around the country trying to get re-elected the day after his inauguration. 
[00:33:00]  You see these presidents going around the country to fundraise and all that.  But you think to yourself, well, that time could be spent doing something else.  Yes.  We do have the Reverend Al post-debate MSNBC roundtable discussion about the debate.  And here is the always smart and genius Reverend Al.  Give him a little.  Great part.  I remember that guy.  I think that, uh, I agree.  Covenant Perry fed red meat to his face. 
[00:33:30]  So hateable.  I think that, uh, he hurt himself, though, with the general, uh, public.  When you go through the fact checks, when they check out, uh, his claims about jobs and  minimum wage in Texas, I think he's going to get, uh, a little hit hard on that.  The Ponzi scheme, uh, science.  I mean, this whole thing of Galeo was outvoted.  I mean, he really got out there.  That meant Galileo.  Pause that.  And you call him on it, you know.  There'll be a problem.  That whole thing with Galeo. 
[00:34:00]  With fucking Galeano.  I love that wine.  That's that Guinea wine, right?  Don't the Wops drink that shit?  Oh, but I'm impervious.  I'm black.  I can say that.  Look, I suck at talking, but I know it's, uh, Galileo.  Of course.  What did he say?  Galeo?  Galeo or something.  That sounds like a brand of, uh, wine in the box.  I mean, he really got out there, uh, but.  Oh, they're killing him, too. 
[00:34:30]  Jello.  A little hit hard on that.  The Ponzi scheme, uh, science.  I mean, this whole thing of Galeo was outvoted.  I mean.  Seriously?  Galeo.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Ugh.  Why don't you Galeo on a train track?  You fat fucker.  He is a fucking hateable guy.  And I hate, what I hate the most about him is that brow thing he does.  His furrowed brow that he's always angry. 
[00:35:00]  I fucking hate that.  Well, he's perpetually outraged.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's been outraged for so many years, his face stuck like that.  Outrage pays well.  Oh, it pays well.  Look at the suit he gives him.  Why don't we go into the world of outrage?  Yeah.  Man, look at the suits.  He's flying first class.  He's on TV.  Oh, it's amazing.  How do you join that?  I don't know, but who is this Copper Nickers guy?  I don't know.  Copper Nichols?  No, they're not.  Penny's his copper.  Oh, who was it? 
[00:35:30]  That's what I said.  What about soul crates?  What did soul crates say?  Play-Doh?  I had that as a child.  Didn't it pick up comics when you pressed it on a...  Oh, no, wait a minute.  That was silly putty.  That's what I got between my legs.  One silly putty.  Copper Nickers.  Why would he wear them?  They sound uncomfortable.  Oh, he was...  Oh, I gots it.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:36:00]  Arrows throttled.  What?  How fast does an arrow have to go?  I'm outraged.  Outraged.  But I'm sure he knows the peanut inventor guy.  Why is everyone scared to correct him, by the way?  Because it's racist.  Why can't one of those idiots in the round table go,  you mean Galileo, right?  I would be all over him like, really?  Right.  Did you mean Galileo?  What?  What if I said George Washington Carter, you dummy?  Oh, you'd be outraged. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, of course.  They don't correct him for the same reason they have him there.  They're just groveling pussies.  MSNBC really are.  What a shitty network.  Be all over him.  Ugh.  Just the way other people are punished publicly for saying stupid things.  Yeah.  No one has said more dumber things than this guy.  He said more stupid things.  Oh, yeah.  Year after year.  And the fact that he is now considered a viable opinion.  Yes.  He's the Teflon dumb.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  He says something else dumb, doesn't he? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it says, did he mean Galileo?  Science.  I mean, this whole thing of Galileo was outpoted.  I mean, and I think the DNC should take the Social Security line of Mr. Perry and the attack  on Social Security and the Ponzi scheme and put out bumper stickers saying, it's not about  Obama, it's about your mama.  And we'll win.  Yeah, it's good. 
[00:37:30]  Uh, Al's point is very important.  Oh, dramatizing.  Huntley, Brinkley, Chancellor Mudd, Brokaw, Williams.  Sharpton.  Ha, ha, ha.  Very important.  Reverend Al's point.  Oh, shit, they've got an old picture of him with Tawana Brawley.  From the old, uh, 80s days.  Wow, that's funny shit.  That is very fucking funny, man.  Ugh, a good point. 
[00:38:00]  Galileo, and then it's not about Obama, it's about yo mama.  That's right.  That's good.  I'm sure, uh, yeah, the White House is gonna love that.  Yeah.  I wish they'd put those stickers out.  We got this for you, Ann.  Brad in D.C., go ahead, Brad.  Well, Brad.  Quickly, Brad, let's go.  Hey, uh, I don't blame you for, uh, bashing MSNBT, but fucking Reverend Al's on, uh, Fox  News all the time.  Not anymore.  Yeah, let me tell you something, though.  When Reverend Al goes on Fox News, it's as the opponent, he's, he does, uh, he does Hannity's 
[00:38:30]  show a lot, and, and he comes off these points, and Hannity will not let him get away with  one fucking dumb thing he says like this.  Do you understand?  Would Hannity correct him on the Galileo thing?  Oh, yeah.  Correct him.  He'd be all over him.  And you're not gonna see Al Sharpton on Fox anymore, because that's the competition.  MSNBC hired him, right?  Yeah.  And MSNBC now, uh, they, they wouldn't, they wouldn't jump on him.  And, and don't debate his point.  They just let him get away with it. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, Hannity, anyway, but, uh.  Oh, no, he wouldn't.  O'Reilly does kiss his ass.  Yeah.  O'Reilly kisses his ass?  Do you think if he said Galeo, that O'Reilly, uh, uh, wouldn't, uh, jump on that and go,  who?  What are you talking about?  I'm not, I'm not arguing.  I think, uh, MSNBC.  Yes, you are, sir.  Terrible.  Okay, I'm arguing with me.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  I think Hannity would be much more likely to jump on him than O'Reilly.  Oh, he would, yeah.  Yeah, O'Reilly seems to.  O'Reilly tries to be fair and balanced a little too much.  Oh, really?  Does he?  You know when he goes home, well, he's not too fair and balanced. 
[00:39:30]  I bet he's fair and balanced.  I bet, I bet, I bet he sounds a lot like me when he goes home.  That's all I'm saying.  Another Long Island fucking piece of white trash.  Is he?  Oh, please.  We all are.  You, uh, you want to do the weatherman story before the break?  This is.  Just to change it up a little bit, because we went a little serious there.  Davis, this is the funniest story ever.  And, and we pointed this out years ago.  The name always fits the story.  Yeah.  We got a guy, he's a weatherman in, uh, where the hell is he again? 
[00:40:00]  Arkansas, right?  Oh, yeah.  Arkansas.  If you're Sharpton.  Arkansas.  Uh, TV weatherman, Brett Cummins.  Oh, yes.  The name always has something to do with the story.  Oh, boy.  Brett Cummins wakes up in a hot tub.  Um, it was actually a regular bathtub.  Yeah.  It was just a bathtub.  Why are they calling it a hot tub?  Because it had a couple jets?  It must have had jets, but it was in the house, and it was a bathtub in this gentleman's house.  Fuck.  Uh, not, not the weather guy's house.  Another friend. 
[00:40:30]  TV weatherman, uh, Brett Cummins wakes in hot tub with naked dead man, but it's a bathtub.  Yeah.  Uh, our Kansas police are investigating the death of a man found naked in a hot tub next to a sleeping TV weatherman.  He was wearing a dog collar around his neck.  Yeah.  Uh, a friend woke, uh, meteorologist Brett Cummins of Little Rock Station, K-A-R-K, on Labor Day.  He found the forecaster snoring in the empty whirlpool next to a nude man with a dog collar around his neck. 
[00:41:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah.  Bring out the gimp.  The gimp's sleeping.  And, I guess you better go wake him up then.  Ha, ha, ha.  Do you think he, uh, had the guy on the collar at one point in the tub, and they were drinking, doing some drugs,  and then he took his five fingers and just put him over the top of his head and...  Ha, I love that scene.  Absolutely.  Ah.  The 36-year-old resident who made the Grizzly Discovery, Christopher Barber. 
[00:41:30]  So, another guy was involved.  Yeah.  This guy came in to wake up the weatherman.  What do you think, motherfucker?  What do you think, motherfucker?  What do you think, motherfucker?  Ha, ha, ha.  Allegedly told police that the victim, 24-year-old Dexter Williams, was blue in the face and lying near Cummins' shoulder.  All right, look, if he's blue in the face, someone's cumming.  What?  This is crazy.  A lot of fucking blowjob jokes here.  Yeah, yeah.  Barber says the two men were in his home the night before drinking and snorting drugs. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, boy.  Police haven't determined the cause of death, but a detective allegedly found a ring of blood in the bottom of the empty tub.  A ring of blood.  Gee, I wonder where that came from.  A perfect ring of blood.  Ow.  Wow, did Kevin just wake up?  I said Arkansas on purpose.  Yes, you douchebag.  Oh, my God.  Because Jimmy pointed out that's how Al Sharpton would say it.  Ugh.  Oh, God.  Please listen closely.  He was sitting on a burning ring of blood. 
[00:42:30]  I bet he's in the shape of fingers, too.  Oh, yes.  Five fingers.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Police are waiting for autopsy results, and don't consider Cummins a suspect.  Yeah, but he don't have no job no more.  Well, I guess the station said he's just taking some time off to mourn the death of a friend.  Well, you know what?  That's how it always begins now.  Of course.  Yes, and so they have an internal investigation.  A couple weeks will go by, and Brett Cummins is no longer with K-A-R-K. 
[00:43:00]  Now, this guy kind of looks like the type of guy that, I'm not saying he would wake up next to a corpse in a bathtub,  but he looks like the kind of guy that would get into a tub with another guy with a dog collar on.  He doesn't eat?  Well, I think that's pretty obvious from the story.  Weather men got some bad reps, some of these weather men.  What could you be doing in the tub?  Who had the dog collar?  The other guy?  The other guy.  The dead guy.  And there was a ring of blood.  Ring of blood.  So, I mean, there was probably something in an asshole you'd hope. 
[00:43:30]  Well, you would hope.  How else would you get blood there?  I mean, what else is he?  I don't think there was a knife used.  And how do you fall asleep?  The drugs.  Well, the drugs after a bender.  So maybe there was a little ass fucking or something?  There could have been.  Possible.  I would assume there were some things going on.  They were doing their drugs and partying.  And then the guy probably maybe had a heart attack or something.  Some kind of activity.  Sure.  Maybe the dog collar was a little too tight.  What?  Maybe they were doing some auto-erotic asphyxiation with the dog collar. 
[00:44:00]  And he got hung up on the drain, maybe, or on the spigot.  There's so many things that could happen with two nude men in a bathtub.  Why wouldn't you get out of the tub and just say that you walked in and found him?  No, he was asleep.  He was asleep.  The weatherman was still asleep.  Dead guy is on his shoulder.  And then the guy that owned the house came in, saw it, freaked out.  Then weather guy wakes up, sees dead guy next to him, and then runs out. 
[00:44:30]  Runs out of the bathroom and proceeds to start vomiting in the living room.  He was so freaked out.  He was screaming and vomiting in the living room.  This guy's house is just a disaster at this point.  There's a fucking, there's a dead man with a fucking stringy, bloody asshole, a vomiting weatherman.  And he has company coming over it.  Chance of blood in the tub, 100%.  I'm surprised they didn't try to chop the guy up into little pieces like our bunny suit scenario that we love talking about every once in a while. 
[00:45:00]  You know, we probably thought, like, my gig's over.  Yeah, this is a career ender, so you've got to imagine that you've got to maybe try to cut the body up into tiny pieces and hope no one comes a-calling.  Yeah, you think before they called the cops, they might have had a discussion, the owner of the house and the weatherman?  Like, ah, man.  Is there anything we could do here?  Like, the guy that owns the house immediately was like, I'm calling the cops.  Right.  And you'd think maybe the weatherman was like, look, let's sit down and talk about this. 
[00:45:30]  Let's sit down for a minute.  Just for a minute.  Just for a minute.  Give me a minute.  I just want to go over some options.  He's thinking about his weather gig, his cushy gig at the TV station.  And he's rolling through scenarios of all the people he knows in the news department going, like, now they're telling the story of how he woke up with a dead guy.  And you think Brett Cummins is going, now, I'm not saying we do this, but hear me out of here.  But now, calling the cops, of course, it's a great idea.  Great idea.  Great.  It's the number one idea.  We understand. 
[00:46:00]  But let's look at a number two idea and weigh it and see if we really need to do this first.  Do you have a chainsaw?  Anything.  An axe?  An axe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I'm thinking maybe no one is, if there's any way no one has to know about this.  I mean, you know and I know, but why does anyone else have to know?  Right now, that's it.  Right.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So, put the phone down. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Put the phone down.  We can always call the cops.  Relax.  That's a different thing.  Yeah.  The cops, they're not going anywhere.  You got any wine?  Let's have a glass of wine.  Let's settle down a little bit here.  We don't even know when this happens, so there's no big time of death problem.  So, let's just think this over a little more.  Well, I would assume that this Christopher Barber, who found the weatherman asleep in the hot tub with the other guy dead with the dog collar, doesn't like Brett Cummins too much. 
[00:47:00]  Probably not.  Because he could have got him out of the situation.  He said, look, all we have to do is say, hey, he's in the hot tub dead.  Well, I don't think the other guy that owns the house wanted to take the wrap for the partying, the drugs, the collar.  Good point.  Good point.  You know, if you fall asleep in a tub with somebody, there was some shenanigans going on.  Sure.  I think.  Wow, that guy.  Oh, he's got a Facebook page.  Oh, he does.  What was his last post?  Oh, God.  Here is your...  The other guy has a blue in the Facebook page. 
[00:47:30]  He's dead.  Here is your Labor Day evening webcast.  Oh, nice.  And all these people are blocking the comments because I guess he's got a couple people that  are administrators or something on the page because there are people who just keep trying  to comment rude things but keep being blocked.  There's references to them.  All the rude things are gone.  They're saying horrible things probably.  Yeah.  I would hope so.  What was his last post?  What was his last post?  It was probably like feeling sleepy, going to hop in the tub and fuck Jerry. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  BRB.  BRB.  Water's overflowing in the tub.  Going to fist my friend and tighten the dog collar.  Yeah, the blood is disturbing.  What the fuck?  BRB.  Big ring of blood.  Well, ring of R-O.  All right, whatever.  Good enough.  I try so hard sometimes. 
[00:48:30]  Nothing comes out.  Oh, well.  That is an interesting little story there, isn't it?  You're missing it.  Brett Cummings on Twitter also.  Well, Joker is saying we're missing the obvious.  At Brett Cummins WX.  Let's check it out.  What was his last tweet?  At Brett Cummins WX.  And we'll see what his last tweet was.  Joker in Tennessee.  What's up, Joker?  Hey, guys.  Joker.  You missed the obvious.  Oh, sorry.  The dog collar out of leather. 
[00:49:00]  It gets wet.  It constricts.  And the guy chokes.  Oh, well.  You know what?  It could have gotten a little wet.  Oh, okay.  Got a little tighter, right?  Gets a little tight.  Okay.  He falls asleep.  Maybe he never falls asleep.  He's choking to death.  And there's good old Brett Cummings who's snoring away.  Who can't handle his drugs.  So he's out cold.  Can't handle his fucking ground up oxy.  Whatever he was doing.  Oh, poor weather, man.  Oh, that's terrible.  Google Cummins image for new torso pics of deceased. 
[00:49:30]  There's no fucking way.  That's going to be a real thing.  What's that?  There's no way.  This guy Bill in Columbus is saying.  Oh, Bill.  Cummins, C-U-M-M-I-N-S image for new torso pics of deceased.  Is it possible?  Nah, come on.  They wouldn't have fucking.  Yeah.  What's that?  Is that him?  Is that him?  Maybe it's a picture of him.  No.  That's him.  It's some young gentleman nude from the waist up, though. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  Weatherman awakens.  Who is that?  It's the guy.  It's the guy.  That's the guy who's dead guy?  Yeah.  It's the twink.  Victim.  The body of Dexter Williams was found curled in the fetal position in a  hot tub with Arkansas weatherman, Brett Cummins.  Wow.  What a little twinkish lad he seems to be.  He's in great shape.  They were both in a tub together. 
[00:50:30]  They definitely had sex.  Oh, they so had anal intercourse.  Two guys.  Just fucking in a tub.  Fucking and sarking.  Leaving blood and, oh.  They had butt sex.  Jeez.  They had some butt sex.  Yeah.  You think the owner of the home had a really good night's sleep and then just  kind of wakes up and is like, that's terrible.  I got to check in the house and wonder where everyone is.  I wonder what happened last night.  Do we have the wake up music, maybe?  Oh.  Do we have that, E-Rock? 
[00:51:00]  It all starts so nice.  You wake up from a good night's sleep.  Oh, well.  Oh, I was just.  Wow.  I'm exhausted.  What a night.  Who was over?  Brett.  Brett was over and then Dexter.  Holy shit.  I left him in the bathroom.  I wonder if there's still partying.  Let me, let me get up and, uh, and walk.  Just walk inside. 
[00:51:30]  Ah, who's that?  Look in the bathroom here.  Holy shit.  There's a dead guy at the top.  Brett, wake up, bitch.  What the fuck are we going to do, bitch?  Dexter's dead.  Dexter.  Oh, my God.  He's got a tall collar around him.  You're vomiting in my living room.  The guy was already in the bathroom. 
[00:52:00]  It's like, why would you have to leave in the bathroom?  I know.  Toilet's right there.  Yeah.  You know that the vomit in the living room was more of a drag than what was going on in  the bathtub.  He probably smelled like whatever he ate and cum.  He could get rid of all that shit in the bathtub by just turning on the faucet, right?  Well, that's true.  Vomit, man.  You're going to get down on all fours and scrub that shit out of the rug.  Well, all fours part's probably easy, but scrub and vomit.  Yeah, butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Dave in Texas says, this isn't the best weatherman story of all time. 
[00:52:30]  What?  No.  It's a good one.  Dave wants to put this on the table.  Dave?  I don't know if it's the best ever, but we had a guy here in Wichita Falls that used  to be our weatherman, and the word got out that he'd had a gerbil stuck in his ass.  Oh, come on.  We need a new story.  No one really does that.  No, no.  This was in the mid-'80s, and so he used to call our CBA basketball team games.  He was like one of the commentators at the little stadium.  If his buddy lit a match to find him, and the gerbil shot out and broke his nose and 
[00:53:00]  burnt his face, I'm going to hang up in a second.  Yeah, we're going to have to find you to Google Earth and kill you.  That was before, like, the internet.  That was like shit would be faxed to you, that story.  We never did that story as real, right?  We always did that when it was fake.  I believe we always did that as fake.  I know a lot of radio guys got tricked by that one.  Yeah.  A lot of them.  Well, I mean, nobody ever knew if it was true, but at the CBA game, we had a team called  the Texans, and they were playing for the championship that year, and he used  to call the games, and some drunk ass started the chant, faggot! 
[00:53:30]  Jesus.  Not much tolerance down there, sir.  No.  Not much at all.  Everybody in town had heard this fucking story, you know?  I mean, it just kind of made the ramps, and there were, you know, gerbil jokes and all  sorts of shit.  Well, literally.  It's gerbil and shit.  We don't have a news story on this?  No.  We don't have a news story on this, Dave.  Very suspicious here.  If it ain't on AP, it didn't happen.  Dude, this is a town of 100,000. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know if they put it in the newspaper, but everybody in town knew it.  All right.  Well, there you go.  All right, guys.  All right.  Hey, Jimmy.  Bye-bye, buddy.  All right.  We should take a break.  Yeah, we should.  Patton is here.  Patton Oswalt is here.  You missed Roland's pronunciation of Patton.  Oh, really?  Patton.  P-A-T-T-E-N.  Patton.  Patton.  Patton Oswalt is here.  He's doing the rest of the show with us today.  That's really cool.  That is cool.  It's a good egg.  And then Nick Swartzen's coming in today, too.  Nice. 
[00:54:30]  I think 9 o'clock.  Very cool.  Why don't we take a break and we'll get Patton Oswalt in here.  Yes.  And we'll continue.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  And about me sounding like a white supremacist over the past week or so since Obama was elected,  I'm seeing things that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my imagination.  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  And is it all up to me?  Come on.  Now, I've been listening on the radio to what's going down on the O&A show. 
[00:55:00]  Obama's got Anthony's tickets in a twist.  Gas.  There's something about the tax and the guns in the stairs.  Wow.  Guess it in fact, they're going to take Ant's gun to it.  Robbing the rich or the black man's van.  Wow.  That's just crazy if you think for a second.  Wow.  Yeah.  Now, why the fuck would I want Anthony's check unless I'm getting a show?  Wait, let's check it to smell me.  Wow.  Sweet radio show.  Yeah, that would sell me.  Yeah.  But am I getting paid?  And I'm going to buy my president now.  That's right.  Well, I'm going to take Ant's money and give it all up to the K. 
[00:55:30]  I'm not taking this crap.  I'm going to take Ant's money and give it all up to the K.  That's what you do.  You're a high-profile radio host.  Dude, I can't take this anymore.  I can't take it.  It's a United Negro.  Cool me a bun. 
[00:56:00]  A chicken every bed and under 21.  So turn in your guns for the common brain.  Get a Starbucks for the great soda machine.  Gonna get me fired at the person in.  And Anthony's gonna have to take it on the chin.  I'm bumping in the crackers at Dosted Clear.  It's the black man's time for terror and fear.  Don't worry about the mortgage or paying your rent.  Obama's got your back because he's having sex.  And when he's done improving my life, I'm going to have more money than Ant's life.  I'm going to take Ant's money.  I'm not joking.  This is what we're dealing with. 
[00:56:30]  I'm going to take Ant's money and give it all up to me.  Yeah, we're hurting.  And in this country, you've been allowed to voice that opinion and then have a dialogue  about it with other people who disagree with that opinion.  That's great.  It's a great thing.  But we've got to this point where you just can't do that anymore.  It's, um, it's, no.  Hey, Obama president.  That's what the president's going to do for you?  Now you can walk in front of white people's cars. 
[00:57:00]  I'm sick of it.  Do you need a baby aspirin or something?  Shut the F up.  But now I see  Obama president, man.  On the Dennyville Highway  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Dennyville Highway  Rode it alone 
[00:57:30]  Dennyville Highway  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Jim in the back  Eddie in the front  Over the end of the wheel  And we ain't gonna stop on the Dennyville Highway  Climbing along  Get him on the highway 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Daddy's hands up  Send him down  Travis going bald  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Steve's going gay  On the Dennyville Highway  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Get him on the highway  Rode it alone 
[00:58:30]  Get him on the highway  Sirius XM  This is the opinion of today's show  Dirty old town  Dirty old town  Clouds are drifting across the moon  Cats are prowling on their bees 
[00:59:00]  Springs a girl  Run the streets at night  Dirty old town  Dirty old town  This is the reason we're playing this today  Anyone wanna...  What?  We've picked up 1-800-DENTIST as a sponsor  Have you ever seen this motherfucker?  Jesus Christ's teeth is horrendous  Is it Shane McGowan's birthday?  Brushes with a shotgun  No, no, no 
[00:59:30]  Is Pat a big Poges fan?  We do have Pat Noswald in here  You wanna venture a guess there, sir?  Hmm  I didn't even know, to be honest with you  Iraq told me during the break  He's gonna do this  Oh, I actually do know this  What?  I'll let everybody guess  It's because it's the one guy that Sinead O'Connor wouldn't fuck  If he answered her ad  Please, Shane, don't answer my ad  I guess, because I'm way behind on this  But I guess Rescue Me ended their run with this song 
[01:00:00]  With this song, yeah  Oh, they did  That was their last episode  Yeah, I'm a little behind  So don't tell me what happened  But I guess they ended  Do they pull out to reveal the whole show takes place in a gap between Shane's teeth?  That would be amazing  That would be very cool  Yeah  The whole thing  The whole thing  Yeah, and then he just kinda digs it out and leaves it on a pub  On a pub bar  And wanders out  Or does a Guinness  Yeah  Throws up and leaves  Great  Feels like I got firemen between me front  Please  Give me another show of Jameson 
[01:00:30]  The end  You Google him and YouTube  You can see there's videos of him just singing in pubs  What a fucking drunk  Yeah, yeah  He's great  And it's clear that he just stood up  And somebody  Everyone scrambled and got their camera phones out  Yeah  He's just singing  Oh, Shane's singing again  I heard his teeth got fixed  That's amazing  What?  I heard he fixed his teeth  Why?  What?  He's known for his teeth  Maybe it's hard to sing  His voice  You can't sing S's with no teeth 
[01:01:00]  I don't think he would care  Yeah  Oh, wow  So this is how Rescue Me went out  It was a great season, too  I didn't see last night's episode  So, um  You're a little behind, too, right?  Yeah, I got it  What they call DVR  And all the kids are doing it  I'm still on season one first  I've never seen it  Is that it?  Season one?  We've got quite a way to go  Rescue Me is great, man  I like it  I have all these shows  That if I don't get into them early  Then they pile up  And it feels like it's homework now  Like, oh, I gotta shake loose 
[01:01:30]  18 hours in my schedule  I haven't seen Dexter  I haven't seen Rescue Me  You're right  You are so right  You're absolutely right  There are plenty of shows  I haven't seen that I want to see  But I kind of like when I don't watch them  When they air  Yeah  And then you could just do those marathons  If you're really  You know, you have the flu  Yeah  Whatever  How great is it when you don't have to wait a year?  Yeah  For the next season  Yeah, it's like  Season after season  You just don't have to wait a year  You like it  It's right there  Yeah  But it does get like a job, though  Where you're ten episodes in 
[01:02:00]  And you're just like  Alright, put in another one  Fuck  You're obligated to just keep going  Right?  Sweetie, I can't play catch with you today  Daddy's gotta catch up on Fringe  I'm sorry  I know this is a moment I'll regret never having again  But I got  I can't be the odd man out in my conversation with my friends  You know who piles them up is E-Rock  He piles them up, right?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, I'm starting Mad Men soon  Oh, good thing you mentioned it  No one will spoil it  Yeah  It's only four seasons in 
[01:02:30]  I never mention the shows I'm watching on this show  Because the lovely listeners will fuck it up for everybody  I'm gonna watch that bitch link  Yeah  Don't  You'll tweet and it'll be like  Hey, check out this link, hot chick  And you click it  And it's a screen cap of the show  With someone important dying  And you're just like  Oh, thanks  Thanks, asshole  Son of a bitch  Thank you  By the way, can you send the naked girl picture?  Yeah  Please  Yeah  I can't find them on my own  Naked girl  Patton, what are we 
[01:03:00]  Any naked girl  What are we promoting?  Because we're gonna forget by the end of the show  What are we promoting?  Seven  He comes into seven  Here's my sheet  See, this is what I love  And the finest hour on Showtime  On Demand  Oh, cool  The album is out September 20th  You see how easy this is?  I made a law, Opie  I made my own rule when me and Jimmy were doing the show  When you were fighting off a hurricane down in the Outer Banks  I said, because they used to give me the very detailed sheet  And there were numerous ones for each guest 
[01:03:30]  And I'm like, ah  I said, put the guest  What time they come in  And by the way, I want the time they come in  Then the guest  So I don't say Patton Oswalt, seven o'clock  That's silly  So if it's seven o'clock, Patton Oswalt  And then it would be like  Finest hour on Showtime On Demand  Album comes out September 20th  That's all I need to know  But you don't know anything about him now  He's here, he can tell it  You don't know anything about him  He can tell it  That's intrigue  I love not knowing  Exactly  Why have a spoiler?  It's what I'm talking about  See, even the staff is spoiling my stories that I don't know yet about Patton 
[01:04:00]  What about another sheet where we go deeper with Patton?  Yeah, can we have two sheets of people that want to know?  Yeah, I want to know some things about Patton that I didn't know before  I don't  You know this, Joe  When you go on a show and it's clear that they're reading off of a Wikipedia bio as they introduce you  A Wikibio  You know?  So apparently we're on the Lusitania  Has been headlining club since 1996  And made a big splash  Oh God  Just save my name  I'll talk about what's happening right now  That's exactly it to me  I hate that other shit 
[01:04:30]  I don't like the filler  I hate it  I love when you go to a radio show and they're like  So where do you want us to go?  What do you want us to feed you?  I love to just do material and make it sound natural  Yeah, yeah  That's the best part  Funny you should mention anal farts  Here's ten prepared minutes  Did I just say anal farts?  Where else do they come out of?  That's alright  A vagina  Oh yeah  You know what?  That's for Al  But they're called queeps  Yeah, they are  Thanks for saving me there  No, you're right though  It just means you're doing a good job  That was clarity 
[01:05:00]  It needs more clarity  This rain, man  What gives?  What did a weatherman murder someone in his bathtub?  Why is he doing like this?  What's the matter of your friend?  It's crazy  That weatherman story is terrific  And his name is Brett Cummins  I mean, it's just  Come in  Yeah  Perfect  I like the round circle  The little ring of blood in the tub  Very mysterious  I was  There's no mystery there  Speculating  I watch a lot of the crime shows  I watch the cold case files 
[01:05:30]  And forensic files  And all that stuff  I love that shit  And the ring of blood  And the dead guy  This was one of these jacuzzi bathtubs  Now I've heard tell  That some of the vacuum suction things  Can be very, very harmful  And can actually suck people's guts out  And prolapse  So perhaps he got his asshole sucked out of him  Yeah?  Maybe  What if that was the actual thing that happened  And he has to make that sound legit to the cops?  Yeah  Yeah, look 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, come on  I'm sure an asshole got sucked out of you  Hey, it's a really good system  I went for the upgrade  I really went with that heavy suction pump  I should have went with the 110  I went with the 220  There's actually a picture on the box  Of a guy grabbing his asshole  With his eyes open wide  This is a very powerful suction  Yeah, what if they had like a little industrial graphic for that  For a prolapse rectum  Like, warning  Like, you know, don't use electric material  Don't get your asshole near the jets  What was his last tweet?  How would that look?  The sign  Because you know the corrosive one 
[01:06:30]  Is a hand getting eaten away by corrosive  And then there's the gears  That are folding the guy into an accordion  And then there's just an asshole  Being pulled out of a gentleman with a pump  Yeah, and for every one of those graphics  There was a team of artists  That had to argue  What's the best  Like the slip 3-4  That went through eight or nine versions  Yeah, yeah  Well, it looks like he's flying  It doesn't sell the message  Yeah, we gotta fix that  You gotta make it look like he's slipping  Now he looks like he has a big dick  What are you doing here?  No, the legs are going up in the air 
[01:07:00]  Come on, man  Slipping guy is difficult  Because sometimes he does look like a professional skater  Yeah  He's doing a kowtow  A little pirouette  Uh-huh  Or his reclining is a huge erection  You have to be very careful with that stuff  Electricity, not very difficult to put across  You just put that lightning bolt  The lightning, yeah  Everyone understands the lightning bolt  And the guy's like, ah  Poison  Poison  Everybody knows poison  The skull and crossbones  The hand in the gear is one of my favorites  Because it just looks  You go, ah  There is a visceral, ah 
[01:07:30]  The corrosive is silly  Because no one's going to hold their hand there  Steady  For that long  Until bone show  While it just eats  What looks like a huge bite mark  Out of a hand  It should be a motion blur  Like he's pulling it away at least  Do you remember when there was this campaign  I remember this in the 70s  Called Mr. Yuck  And it was those stickers for kids  And it was his face just going  And parents were supposed to get him  And put him on anything poisonous in the house  So the little kid  And there was a little song  And they would teach kids 
[01:08:00]  Like if you see the sticker  Oh, wow  Don't drink  You know, like  Because the hard to open drain cleaner top  Wasn't enough for kids  Yeah, yeah  You should chug this  E-Rock had that on his refrigerator  Growing up  His parents really tried  They did try  Mr. Yuck  Can we find the Mr. Yuck song?

[01:17:00]  He's still doing it  He's still doing it  I mean in the spirit  Of fairness  Yeah  He really can play  The pan flute  I mean we're all kidding  Aside  And he was the only guy  Though  You didn't have another  Pan flute guy  Who's the second  Pan flute guy  I always like  Knowing the second guy  Pan flute guy is  The bitterest  Motherfucker  Yes  The Pete Best  Of the pan flute  You bring up  The Zamfier  He's like  That's  Oh my god  That's a hack  Yeah  I got close once  Yeah  Let me tell you something  It's Nickelback  Limp Bizkit  And Zamfier  The luckiest  In this business 
[01:17:30]  Don't say that name  To me  There's a whole warehouse  Of Larry the pan flute king  Bumper singers  That never got used  Peace  Stinks  But Larry got in trouble  Locally  With some fucking  Pornographic images  Of children  Some file trading  In the early AOL days  He was in a chat room  LTPFK  Or whatever it is  That was his screen name  We need to write a book  On the second guy  A whole book on 
[01:18:00]  The second guy  The second pan flute guy  Or just the second guy  I don't remember that  I had a lot of other things  Oh right  Well there was always  I think the definitive one  Is the other guy from Wham  Andrew Ridgely  Ridgely  Ridgely got fucked over  Supreme  With that  You know  When what's his name  Bannister  Broke the four minute mile  Yeah  There was another guy  That did it that day  Really  Who's that guy  Who's he  Because he didn't win the race  Wow  Sebastian Coe  Yeah I remember Sebastian Coe  Yes  God damn it  Who's Sebastian Coe  He was a runner 
[01:18:30]  Back in the early 70s  Or mid 70s  Like a marathon runner  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know if he went  Marathon  Did he go  Or maybe he sprinted  I don't know  He was a runner  Can you look that up Sam  That's S  I think he did the middle distances  If you need to know Jimmy  I think  I don't think he did more than  Like the two miles  Didn't he do a three minute mile  Or something  Or no  Is that impossible  No it's impossible  Who knows  What's the fastest mile run  So far  I thought Sebastian Coe  Had it at one point  I'm going to make sure  That he is relevant  It's all about Sebastian Coe  What's David Allen Coe's  Mile record right now 
[01:19:00]  Is he doing  Did he get it down below 10  He did it right after he saw  Who moved in next door  Oh David  Wait hold on  Oh yeah  There you go  He has a tattoo on his top too  I remember years ago  In one of the porn magazines  It might have been We  Or Hustler  In the early 80s  I used to love We  I did too  Showed like hardcore  Pia Zadora  There was a picture of her  Slow fade pink nipples  Yeah in the bathtub  And shit  I remember that  That's a classic pic 
[01:19:30]  But David Allen Coe  Had a tattoo on his cock  I don't remember what it was  It might have been a spider  In the middle of his dick  But one of the magazines  Showed his tattoo on his dick  I don't remember  It's been so many years  That's a hell of a commitment  And a hell of a move  To actually show up  And have that done  Wow  I love that thing  That the onion ran  It was just a picture  Of David Allen Coe  And the headline says  David Allen Coe  Waiting outside  To kick your ass  That's all it says  That's all you need to say  The onion's hilarious man  Yeah  I remember reading something 
[01:20:00]  From the onion years ago  About like Muhammad Ali  And Joe Frazier  Fighting again like now  Right  And how it was just  And they went like  Round by round  And really did it  And they kept calling him  Smoldering Joe Frazier  And how their punches  Weren't even hitting  But the way it was written  I was fucking crying  I had to turn away  And not read anymore  Because I couldn't breathe  Those laughs  Are the greatest  And you'll never hear that  On our show  You'll never get those laughs

[01:22:30]  And reading  And preparing  Because you always  It never occurred to me  That sports radio callers  Actually do that  But I'm sure they do  Oh they're competing with  With each other  Well if you  If you listen to  Because  Because Robert would  Play me some of the  Things that inspired him  And knowing what I know  What you know now  If you listen to some of the callers  They are so clearly reading off  The thing that they prepared  And have  I mean don't you  Haven't you ever guys  Gotten callers where you're like  I think this guy wrote this stuff down  Yeah yeah  Never  We're waiting for that day 
[01:23:00]  That would be real nice  You're aspiring to that  Yeah  Regarding Mr. Norton's statements  On oversized piss flaps  I must vociferously disagree  Point one  Yeah that'll never happen here  No  Unfortunately not  Hey guys  They're all adults  So what's going on  What are you doing  So what's up  We're good  Hey is Jim Norton there  What do you got  Happy birthday Jimmy

[01:24:30]  Do you guys call into a lot of sports shows  Oh no  Not only that  Because when you talk about  The Giants are like  Oh we gotta win this week  What do you think we should do  You know  You get into a panic  Like you're responsible for it  We gotta do something here  What do we do  Yeah  And you think everything  With the good luck charm  Yeah  I know you're  I know you're not in here  To promote that  But that's out there where 
[01:25:00]  Just kinda  You can buy it on DVD  You can get it on iTunes  Has the worst DVD cover  For a movie  It is the most misleading  DVD cover I've ever seen  No no  The poster that they did  Was great  Then they did a DVD cover  That makes it look like  Oh my god  I'm gonna be at a football game  Right  That looks like the cover  Of a movie like Rudy  Yeah I know  I look like  It's like  It looks like  Like you know  Patent special day  At the stadium  Where I'm just like  I wanna see football 
[01:25:30]  And they  They take  It's just  It's so  And the guy  That put it together  We're like  There's no football  In the  You understand  Yeah  It's not about that  And he said  People like football  Like they'll  They'll get it  For that reason  Yeah they'll buy it  And they'll be furious  Yeah of course  Why don't you just put  One fucking play  Yeah if that  If you're gonna use that logic  Put Robocop on the cover  People like Robocop  People love Robocop  Yeah  Oh yeah  They do like Robocop  I'll put that on there  I highly recommend you go  Try to find a big fan  With Patton Oswalt  It's on Netflix right 
[01:26:00]  And with football season  You know  Starting this week  Yeah it is  Perfect time to watch that  It was such a good script  And apparently  It made the rounds  For like almost a decade  Like people always  Wanted to make it  But it's so dark  And he wouldn't change it  And then he did  Wrote the wrestler  And that got him  All this heat  And he said  Alright screw it  I'm gonna make big fan now  Oh wow  Now that I have the heat  To do it  Really  Yeah  Yeah  Isn't it interesting  How stupid they are too  Like all these years  It's a little too  Dive  Fucking people  I really hate  Entertainment business 
[01:26:30]  Oh it's not a typical  Hollywood movie  This thing is dark  No no no  This is like one of those  Early 70s  Yeah  Five easy pieces  And you know  But it's  God they just shot  They shot the  Hell out of it  It looks great  And it really looks  Here's what  The only thing that really  Drove me crazy about the movie  Was after it came out  We got really good reviews  And then the village voice  Which I love the village voice  But their review was like  The guy was like  Oh these  These horrible  Staten Island stereotypes  Like oh we're gonna laugh 
[01:27:00]  At these suburban idiots  A  The guy that wrote that  Review would never go to  Staten Island  So he's defending people  That he would never  Actually go hang out with  And B  Everyone I've met  From Staten Island  Goes that's exactly  What it's like  You totally nailed it  That's exactly what  It's like out here  Like I  Nothing cracks me up  More than people  Defending people  That don't want their help  When they  They try to  Pick the fight for  The people like  No that's actually  Pretty accurate  No that's it  Yeah  He's right  Yeah don't defend me 
[01:27:30]  Against that  Because I actually  Kind of agree with that  Right on  Yeah  Critics are really annoying  When they like good things  I kind of like them  Fuck them  When they like your stuff  You love them  Yeah  Yeah I wouldn't know  But I mean I'm sure  That it's gotta be a nice feeling  When that happens  Why don't we let  Patton finish his bagel  We'll take a break  Oh man I'm sorry  I'm eating on the air  No I don't mean it  We do it all the time  Oh you do  Okay  No I don't mean it  I don't mean it  Go ahead  Rich Voss was actually  We were actually doing  Something with him  Where he had to ask him  A question 
[01:28:00]  And he was like  Hold on  And he would bite  His egg sandwich  And then prepare  To answer the question  Yeah  There's nothing you can do  On the air  That's more distracting  Than Voss  And his Nicorette  I want to get  Patton's take on the debate  Because you were great  On Twitter last night  Thank you man  It was really good too  Man just going  With the flow  How come  What about me  I didn't read your  Did you  Were you  Oh I blocked you  So I don't have your  Twitter  Jim I don't think  I'm following you  Oh shit  Oh dude  That's terrible  But I just want to help  Chessie

Exactly  Oh you want to hear  The Michael Jordan  Outtakes from that commercial?  Is it in you?  Oh no  Have you ever heard this?  Oh it's terrible  It's so worth playing for Patton  Yeah  All Michael Jordan  Had to do  Was that one lousy line  Yep  Do we have that  Quickly direct?  Here it is  Listen to this  Ready?  God he couldn't get it  Action  Gatorade  Is it in you? 
[01:33:30]  Gatorade  Is it in you?  Gatorade  Is it in you?  He does not  How to say it  That's right  Wait  Gatorade  Is it in you?  Right  Ready?  Is it in  Is it in you?  Ready?  Gatorade  Is it in you?  No  That's not it  This is so aggravating  Gatorade  Is it in you?  Gatorade  Is it?  Gatorade  Is it in you?  No  Nope  One more time  Fucking idiot

I did it right the first time  I love how Michael keep going  You ready?  Michael  They're ready  Trust me  They're way more than ready  They are so ready  They're not the ones with the problem 
[01:35:00]  They assume this would take 30 seconds  Yeah  Can't believe it's the greatest  Is it in you?  Yeah  Oh no  Come on  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Do you want  Well you know  I was talking  There's these two guys  The Sklar brothers  Randy and Jason Sklar  And I was talking to them  About LeBron James  And they were saying  Something really interesting  Which was like  LeBron James  As dumb as his decisions are  Is at his heart  A very nice guy 
[01:35:30]  Which is why  He's not a champion  He doesn't have that  Driven  I will  Whereas  Hmm  And but they go  Consequently  He has the most chance  Of after all this craziness  Of having a normal life  And becoming a real person  You have to be able  To step over people  And be a scumbag  Well not even so much  A scumbag  But but you have to like  Literally think of yourself  In godlike terms  That you are more than human  And and just  The world doesn't quite  Apply to you  Like it does  Little people  In a lot of ways 
[01:36:00]  That's the thinking  Of these champions  Like Michael Jordan  Is an amazing  Basketball champion  And a horrible  Human being  And he's burning  His life to the ground  Because he  That drive  Makes you not live  A good life  Outside of the sport  Outside of what  You're driven on  He buys like  Motocross  Teams and  Hemorrhages money  People go  Hey you can't  Make this work  And he's like  I'm Michael Jordan  In the fourth quarter  I will pull  Like in his mind  He will always  Pull it out  And he's still using  Basketball terms  Always yeah  Like that's the gambling 
[01:36:30]  That's all that stuff  It's so weird  Yeah  I heard he's a big  Card player  Yeah  By the way  Never heard anyone  In my life  Bad mouth Michael Jordan  Until today  Oh really  No it's legendary  Really  Oh yeah  I'm not  Again I'm not  He is an amazing  Basketball player  But a lot of the stuff  That made him  I mean we know  A lot of comedians  That they're amazing  Comedians  And the thing  That makes them  So incredible  On stage  Kind of makes them  Train wrecks  In real life  It happens  It's hard  We're sitting right  Next to one  Let me give you a hint 
[01:37:00]  Without saying  We're both sitting  Next to one  In between you two  Oh guys  Jimmy  Don't be fresh  His name rhymes  With Bim Borton  And I'll just leave it  At that  Oh guys  Tim Horton  He's a Canadian  Hockey player  But you know  What I'm talking about  There's just that  Sometimes the drive  To succeed  In one small area  Can really burn  Everything else down  In your life  That's interesting  Good point sir  I'm trying to see  If that applies  To me  Richard Pryor  Oh yeah  You know  The greatest 
[01:37:30]  Of all time  And his fucking  Personal life  Is a disaster  Disaster  Absolute disaster  But on stage  When he was on that stage  And I would say  Like on stage  And kind of nowhere else  Because once he got successful  Look at the  Look at the decisions  He would make  About the movies  He would do  Every  I mean  He would do that  Those early movies  Like Blue Collar  And Lady Sings Blues  Are just like  Can't believe this guy  Didn't get an Academy Award  And then later on  Just went  Toy  Oh my god  They were throwing  Millions at him 
[01:38:00]  It was hard to say  No to the money  I think Brewster's  Millions  There were some  Awful ones  Moving  Oh yeah  Another  What was it  Another U I think  But also I think  It was that thing  Where he goes  I'm on stage  I'm making this  I'm making stuff work  That no one has ever  Been able to make work  Yeah  So the  Getting that mindset  Of like  I can make  Anything work  I can make  It's Carl Lewis  Singing the National Anthem  I can do that  I'm Carl Lewis  I can do anything  No no dude  Just cause you can  You know  Nail the one thing  You probably can't  Do the other 
[01:38:30]  That is a  Fascinating hypothesis  And  I always wonder  If people know  They're assholes  Which is  That's a tough question  Like  I don't know  If I'm looked at  As an asshole  How can you not  But that's just it  I know  That's just it  Don't you see  The billboards  In Times Square  Exactly  That's just it  Like you read  Some things  On Twitter  And stuff  I think it's easier  To maybe  Figure out  If you have  Some asshole-ish 
[01:39:00]  Tendencies  These days  Cause there's  So many people  That can tell you  In the old days  You just walked around  And someone would  Have to go to your face  And say hey  You're an asshole  Take the time  To get a quill  And write it  How would someone  Like a Kobe Bryant  Or a Michael Jordan  Know they're assholes  When that asshole  Behavior  Is what made them  A champion  Like a lot of times  They're on the court  And they do something  And some guy's like  You're an asshole  And he's like damn right  I just scored  Yeah motherfucker  Of course you think  I'm an asshole  And then that just  And I  I'm not even judging  Because if I were  In that position  I know I would be 
[01:39:30]  Even worse  If I had those  Kind of skills  I would be a monster  In your face  Yeah  All the time  And then on the other hand  You have people like  Reggie Miller  Who are just as amazing  And everything I've heard  He's the nicest  Most down to earth  Yeah  So I'm not saying  That applies everywhere  But it clearly  I mean I think that  The most  I know this is weird  But some of our  Most effective presidents  Have been effective  Because they're horrible people  And because they're willing to  I read this great thing  By a guy named  Jonathan Hinkman 
[01:40:00]  A president  Has got to understand  That when he  Goes into the White House  When he leaves  Four or eight years later  He will have  Murdered people  And he's gonna  Have to be able  To sleep with that  For the rest of his life  Wow  So someone like  Jimmy Carter  Who was  He was a really nice guy  And does great work  But not a good president  Because he cannot  Square the fact  And then people like  Like Nixon  Except for all the paranoia  Did amazing  Foreign policy stuff  Yeah yeah  Because he was all like  I gotta kill some people here 
[01:40:30]  To make things  Like it's just that weird  And Clinton too  Clinton  Had  He killed people  Yeah yeah  He went over  Did these little wards  And just  And left  You know what  I'm gonna be okay with it  He didn't inhale  So he had comments  They just do the old reference  Yeah  They just have their old joke  In the  Lewinsky's dress  You got it  Yeah  Yeah  I mean 
[01:41:00]  I was talking with someone  About like  I was arguing with someone  About George Bush  And they brought up  A really good point  About George W. Bush  Because I was like  I think he was a  I think he was a horrible president  And then they said  Well they  You think he's a horrible president  Because he did stuff  He got stuff done  That you didn't want to get done  But as far as being  An effective president  Has there ever been a president  That got everything he wanted  The way they put  Like anything  That's true  Any horrible thing  He wanted to put through  He got it through  That's true  Where it's like 
[01:41:30]  Obama's trying to give people  I want to give you guys  Free health care  No  No  Like you can't get that through  You have a majority  So like  What means  What do you  What do you  What do you mean  When you talk about  Effectiveness  Yeah  Do you know what I'm saying  Absolutely  Like it's just  There's that weird  So I don't know  I'm reading  The Robert Caro's  The Lyndon Johnson  Biography  That big three volume thing  Wow  Unbelievable  It's unbelievable  He was quite the character  Guys  I normally don't read 
[01:42:00]  Huge doorstop biographies  I'm going to  I don't want this thing to end  It's a three volume book  It's huge  The path to power  The master of the senate  It's unbelievable  Unbelievable  What's he up to  I'm in master of the senate right now  And he is basically  I didn't realize it  In the 50s and 60s  The senate was just a joke  It was a joke  And he came in and said  Oh no  I know exactly  What to do with this thing  I'm going to make this 
[01:42:30]  It's unbelievable  How did he become the president  What actually happened  You know  The book says  That it was  JFK committed suicide  Worst research part  But otherwise  Yeah  It's not  Holy shit Jimmy  But yeah  It's an amazing book  I'm trying to  It's funny  I was trying to get  My reading habits  Back  Because I'm so online now  So am I  It's hard to read  For more than five minutes  And I've got to go to the computer 
[01:43:00]  Jerk off  Dude  Exactly  I'm trying to fucking  Just make myself read more  Yeah  Because I used to love to read  A real book  Made of paper  I like to smell it  Yeah  Every time I open  Like four JPEGs  And get them just the right size  So I can jerk off  To the gallery  I've put together  I could have read  A chapter of  I could have read  A Hitchens essay  While I was doing that  It's hard to make yourself read  What happened to my imagination  Nothing worse than spending  Too much time  Jerking off  And realizing  Boy I could have just 
[01:43:30]  Gotten that over with  Yeah  Yeah  Why do I want to make it perfect  Yeah why did I just  I gave my dick dinner  Yeah why did I just  And the light  I just storyboarded  And put a soundtrack  On my masturbation  Good lord  Yeah I know  Spielberg didn't work this hard  On the color purple  Fucking yeah  Holy shit  I'm on pro tools  Like putting fucking  CGI with a girl  Into a slideshow  Yeah  She's in space  It's great  With the Spurgy song on  Alright here we go  Just time it 
[01:44:00]  Time it  It's fucking midnight  I started at five  What's worse than  When you edge for hours  And you finally blow your load  But you time it wrong  And only fluid comes out  And you feel like  You get a half pound of  Spackle left in your balls  Oh no  Like you just  Don't finish the orgasm  It's horrible  It's like a terrible ride  One of those ones  That you just get  A half an orgasm out of  We'll be right back  On the view  In just a second  Thank you Jim  It's not the destination  It's the journey  When the destination  Is a fucking head on  Collision into a wall  The journey wasn't that great  Hey Pat  You gotta give your theory 
[01:44:30]  On drugs and alcohol  Oh well  Okay this is my  And Anthony was with you  On this  Yeah yeah  Okay  I  Well  It starts with that theory  Of like well  Boys are better  Than girls at math  I actually think  With math and chess  There's just a tiny  Portion of the population  That just get it  And then some that don't  And that's it  And we're trying to  Force people that  Everyone can learn math  I don't think that  And I also think  Only a tiny part  Of the population  Needs to know math  And physics 
[01:45:00]  To move us along  So like  Figure out in high school  Who gets it early  Good  Let's put those kids  In the math classes  And leave everyone else alone  And let them go  Now along the same lines  I think that there is  A small part of the population  That do better  On drugs and alcohol  They just  They're actually effective  And it doesn't hurt their lives  And there's no way  To study that  But if they  They could  There's obviously  People that drink  And do drugs  That need to go  Into Alcoholics Anonymous  Right  They're disasters  But there's other people 
[01:45:30]  That it actually  Kind of helps them  Jimmy  Jimmy just  Give me the  Bedroom eyes  I think  Oh that's right  He was staring at me  Not to  But there's  If you read  The William Manchester  Biography of  Winston Churchill  I'm reading all these  Biographies  I'm turning into my dad  I'm reading these  Biographies  Once I start getting  Into the Civil War  Then I'm done  But  Winston Churchill  Would not have won  World War II  If he hadn't been plastered  He was drinking  It helped him  Save the world 
[01:46:00]  Do you think  Some of his  Decision making  Was a little more  Loose  Like  The inhibitions  Kind of drop  And you go  Ah let's send  A whole fucking  Bomber crew  In the daylight  Over there  To Dresden  I think it  Definitely opened  It opened a row  Of doors and windows  In his brain  So that he saw  A bigger perspective  Than someone  Who was maybe  Sober and narrow  And going  Let's look at  The task at hand  Whereas  Winston's like  Let's throw it all  Up in the air  See what  We do here  Boom  Let's run up  The flagpole  See what sticks  Or wait a minute 
[01:46:30]  And he  I mean  So there are  Certain people  That  Eh it kind of helps  It works  You know  And also  Some people  It doesn't  Adversely affect them  And I know  That's a very  Taboo thing to say  But some people  The alcohol and drugs  Are good for them  Do you know  Not everyone can draw  Tippi the turtle  From the matchbook  And it's true  Some people  Are cut out for it  And I think  Your math thing  I think math  Is part art  It's supposed to be  This  Def  Definitive science 
[01:47:00]  Where you know  One plus one is two  That's where mine ends  By the way  But there's an art to it  Wait a second  Wait a second  One  One plus  Plus one  Oh god  I'm sorry you lost me  Yeah I know  See  Some people aren't as good at it  You're probably more  A grammar guy  I don't have the gift  Yeah the gift  It's a  But I think there's an art to it  In looking at those numbers  And instantly being able  To figure it out  Much like a painter would  With a canvas and paint  Yeah  I don't think it's so  I don't believe that  Everyone has a sense of humor  I don't believe that 
[01:47:30]  Everyone can play basketball  Look at this room  Everyone  You know  I just  I do not believe in  Anyone can do anything  Right  We're all equal  Fuck that  The reason that we can move forward  Is that we have  People have different skills  People that are better  At other things  The world needs  Ditch diggers too  You know  Wait there's an art  To building a wall  There's an art to  You know  There is  That some people don't get  I can't build things  I can't build things  And other people can  Right  So yeah  Two parts of men 
[01:48:00]  One part of water  Yeah  And look  I get drunk  And it doesn't really help me  But there's other people  I know that they get drunk  And it really helps them  They're better drunk  Some people are really  Really bad drunks  Yeah  Some people should not be drinking  Yeah  And other people that are fine  And status quo  And other people that  All of a sudden  It becomes a beautiful mind  They're amazing  Yeah  They're writing on the windows  No it happens  Of course it's scribble  Yeah  Yeah  Stick pictures  Wait is this math  You're writing on my  People can see this outside  What are you doing  And then you said 
[01:48:30]  You were a better driver  When you were drunk  I said I was a better driver  When I was drinking  To a point  Not completely drunk  I would hit a point  Where I would be like  I'm not driving  But there was  Times where I would be  Over the legal limit  Of .08  And I knew I was  But I knew I would  Drive home  Doing the speed limit  Staying in the middle lane  Or the right lane  And doing the speed limit  And not weaving  You know  Just keep  And keep my eyes on the road  You would have that focus  Not tailgating 
[01:49:00]  Focused  Because I knew  If I got pulled over  I'd be fucked  No texting or tweeting  No  No changing the radio station  When I was sober  I'm a fucking lunatic  On the road  Well then there's your PSA  If you drink and drive  Drive scared  Drive  Petrified  If you're going to drive drunk  Do it scared  Yeah  And they do scare you  At the commercials  They go  If you're drinking  You will get a D-way  And that just makes me go  Wow I better drive nicely  When I'm drunk  So they don't catch me  Radio off  Window open  Cool air hitting me 
[01:49:30]  Oh the cold air hits you  Radio off really  That's tough to do  There is nothing  But if you're drunk  You get lost  If a great song comes on  Oh man  Forget it  Immigrant song comes on  I'll drive into a school  That will dump your pedal  Boom  That will make your foot  Go down a little bit  On the gas pedal  Who wants to be killed  Listening to  Mare's Eat Oats  And Dozey  Little Lams Eat Ivy  How many people  Do you think have died  Because they didn't like  The song on the radio 
[01:50:00]  Oh and when to change it  How many people have died  Because they loved  The song on the radio  And put their foot there  Yeah  Well that moment  You just looked away  Because you were  Turning the radio  That's what I'm saying  How many people have died  Because the song sucked  On the radio  And you're like  Oh fuck this  And you're looking  For something else  Yeah  Oh how many people died  And they weren't  Close enough to the button  So when they died  It was you know  Like Barry Manilow  Is ready to take  That chance again  Oh no  That was the soundtrack  Of them burning alive  In their car  Oh shit 
[01:50:30]  Take a chance again  My skin is coming off  The cops are trying  To rescue you  They're backing away  From the heat  And they're just  Oh Mandy  Well you came  And you came  We should  Don't even save them  We should get  Some EMT guys  On the phone  I bet you  They have stories  Horrific car accidents  With a horrendous song  Still trying to  We were going to  Cut the guy out of it  But Nickelback's  Photograph was playing  I can't get close to that  Look at this phone  Let him die 
[01:51:00]  You know the guy  Who might have cured cancer  Could have been killed  When he was six  Because somebody  Didn't want to hear  Aha again on the radio  And a fucking  Their car  Plowed into it  Oh god  Yeah  Boom  That is  Rough to think about  Yeah  That's tough  Oh I can't hear  Another foreigner song  Yeah  Ah shit  Pat and James  In North Carolina  Says we don't want  Health care  Because of the price  We have to pay for it  Serious politician guy  Is calling him  It's all just laughs  Serious politics guy 
[01:51:30]  The whole point is  That they're  That it was a thing  That was good  That people just  Aren't they trying  Well the other thing is  Once people get free health care  Then they don't want it  Ever to go away  So that's the other reason  To stop it going through  Because then it becomes  This thing you can use  So  It becomes a right  Just about  Yes exactly  What did you think  Of the debates  Last night there  I loved  I love  I love  Any kind of  Presidential debate  Because  As a comedian  And you know this too Jim  When people  Have something 
[01:52:00]  I've interviewed enough  You hang around  With comedians  Right  Yes  That was brutal  One word  People are never  Less  People are never  More stiff  And overthinking  When they have  Something on the line  Like if you're doing  A set  And it's a Tuesday night  And there's 80 people  In the room  You're just loose  And hilarious  Then if it's a  Thursday and it's packed  And your manager's like  The Letterman people  Are here to watch you  Then you're  Ha ha ha  Why would they ever  Tell you that by the way 
[01:52:30]  Just don't tell me  Let me just go up  So these guys  They've got the White House  On the line  So they're trying to be loose  But their version of loose  Is so stiff  And like  Early on when  Perry and Romney  Were going at each other  With the Al Gore jab  And then the Dukakis jab  I was like watching Gladiator  Yeah  But it still came off  So stiff  Because they would do  The weird nervous laugh  Afterwards  Like  I hope people don't think  I'm an asshole  You know  Which is a weird  So you're saying  It looked more  Punching Judy 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  But in a weird way  Like that's why  Watching someone like  Ron Paul or Michelle Bachman  Who in their heart  They know they're not  Going to get it  Yeah  So they'll just  I'm just going to say  I'm just here to  Get my point across  Pressure's off  It was like  I loved having Al Sharpton  When he would debate  Because he's like  I'm not going to win  I'm just going to try  To get enough votes  That I can bargain  For something I want  Down the line  So he would just  Say whatever  And he was showing  Clips on his show  Of stuff he would  Say to people  And it was so 
[01:53:30]  Brutal  Yeah  I remember seeing him  During those debates  And just being  Horrified and disgusted  Yeah  Because you know  He didn't have a chance  In hell of winning  It's like  And why the fuck  Is he even up there  Because he's the guy  Because he's there  To stir things up  And he's also  He knows how to use  Politics  He knows how to use  The form in the system  To get  He doesn't want  The White House  He wants  The guy  That wants  The White House  To get  To need something  From him  That's the strategy  He  Yeah  He knows how to  Work the system 
[01:54:00]  But it's amazing  He didn't have been  Allowed to stay  In the system  Over the years  And nobody's  Brutal back to him  That's the problem  Right  Is that you know  He's an awful guy  And nobody just  Attacks him  With the venom  That they should  Like so he would  Attack them  And they would look  Weak  Because they don't  Hit back  And just brutalize  Because they don't  Want to be the guy  That yelled at the black guy  Right  Exactly  Exactly  Exactly  Like that thing  In the laugh factory  Oh well  I was talking earlier  About David Duke  And how he  You know  Went into politics 
[01:54:30]  And he  Got cheek implants  Yeah he did  Gorgeous man  Oh just wonderfully beautiful  He got into politics  And he was a bit  Right of the mainstream  Let's say  You think  But he was  But he had  Kind of forsaken  His grand wizard  Of the KKK  Beginnings  And became a politician  Right  But MSNBC  Isn't going to have him on  To talk about  The debates  Yet they have  Al Sharpton on 
[01:55:00]  Who was one of the biggest  Race baiting  Race card playing  Hatred mongers  Of the 80's  With those lying  Mason and Maddox  And Tawana Brawley  And hanging out  Steven Pagonis  And he never  Ever has to pay for that  To this day  No one calls him  Well I bet that  MSNBC would have  David Duke on as a guest  Are you kidding  For the ratings  Yeah  But just like  They would have  Just like Fox  Would have Sharpton on 
[01:55:30]  As a guest  Which they have  Just so they can  Argue with him  I can see that  But they wouldn't  But even like Fox  Wouldn't put David Duke  On to discuss  The presidential debates  It's too out there  But he gets a free pass  For his entire past  Reverend L  Well white guilt's  A beautiful thing  Thank you  That's all I was trying to say  Fox is just as bad  With stuff like race  As MSNBC  Even though they're  Much more conservative  But they're just as frightened  Of being declared racist  Everybody's petrified 
[01:56:00]  Of being declared racist  Believe me  But  Well the code language  Since Obama got into  The White House  Is gorgeous  The gymnastic  Twists and turns  They can't just go  I'm not comfortable  With a black guy  So all the different  Kenyan  Exotic  Right  Yes  It feels like  There's a dry erase board  In the basement  Of  And they have the word  They have the word  Nigger at the top  And then they go  We can't say this  Now I need  Everyone just 
[01:56:30]  Brainstorm ideas  What can we say instead  Oh exotic  Keep throwing them at me  Keep throwing them at me  Kenyan  Nice  Kenyan  Alright  Nice  Okay  Cotton picking  That's going to be  A little clumsy  I don't know  If we can do that one  Yeah  Put it at the bottom  Of the board  We'll  Keep it up there  Think about it  What's so hilarious  Is  Especially watching  The Republican debates  Is that  They are  I mean there is a  There is a Tea Party test  And I don't even  I'm not saying that I disagree 
[01:57:00]  With everything the Tea Party  Says  I just  The way they go about it  Is so  The Tea Party  Is the right wing's  Annoying hippie assholes  They're the  Right  They're their version  Of the women  That are painting their breasts  And dancing with tambourines  We're like  Would you guys just  Grown it down  Stop it  I like some of their ideology  But they're no worse  Than the Congressional Black Caucus  And a lot of this other  Bullshit on the other side  Watching people  That are beholden  To a fringe group  Try to debate  Is so hilarious to me  It really is 
[01:57:30]  They have to like  Throw little like  Bits of red meat  Out to them  That tension is  To me  Just comedically  Is fantastic  Watching them try to  Dance around the obvious  Oh yeah  Is hilarious  When you're  Watching somebody  Tap dancing around the obvious  So they don't come off  Looking a certain way  But you know  They want to step  Right in the middle of that  Like for instance  The evolution thing  I honestly don't believe  In their hearts  Any of those people up there  Disagree with evolution  But they can't just go  Yeah it's been  It's been tested 
[01:58:00]  For hundreds of years  It's proof  Let's just move the hell on  Watch the votes  Just tumble away  They have to go  Well it's not  They also can't just  Come out and go  God just made  The whole thing  So they have to  Find that weird  Right middle ground  And it makes them  Sound crazy  Yeah there's a  The flip  Not even the flip flopping  Just the verbal  Gymnastics  To try to  Twisting and turning  Eat everybody  It's like watching  One of those movies  Where the guy  Has to squeak through  All those lasers  To get to the vault  That's what he's doing 
[01:58:30]  I think we finally have  The first generation  Of politicians  Who finally realize  Everything is on  Videotape now  Everything's recorded  Forever  Everything  So you have to be  Careful what you say  Because that  They can literally  Make you debate yourself  Yes  In ten years  And show what a  Hypocrite you are  They were trying to do  It on the debate  Last night  And I was watching  The clip didn't work  I actually was sitting there  And I said  Out loud to myself  I'm alone drinking  Remember  And I sat there 
[01:59:00]  In front of the TV  And actually went  Why would it work  I swear to you  It's what we do here  Every time something  Doesn't work  Like play the clip  We go  Why would it work  So he goes  And this is you  You know  A few years ago  Talking about  This subject  We want you  And literally  He would have had to  Debate himself  Oh yeah  It's like  Oh I hated that guy  Yeah fuck him  That guy was miserable  I'm telling you  I'm not that guy anymore  After watching  Last night's debate  It will come down  To either  Romney or Perry 
[01:59:30]  And the reason I can say this  As a comedian  Is they were the stiffest  Right  Because they have something to lose  They looked presidential  Everyone else is just  Not even presidential  They looked like  Gotta be  Do not fuck this up  You know  So close  And Kane  And Bachman  And they were just like  Alright so  Anyway  They just  Bachman  Turner  Overdrive  They were just  I knew  Wow  I remember in 2008  I knew  That's  I knew that McCain 
[02:00:00]  Was going to lose  In 2008  When I watched  The Alfred E. Smith dinner  Because  Obama went up  And he was kind of funny  But he was a little stiff  And he was  You know  Thinking that  And McCain was so fucking funny  Yeah  Because he clearly  It was a week before the election  Someone showed him the numbers  He was like  I'm not gonna win  Fuck this  Boom  And just went out  And then  Went on SNL  And killed  And when Obama went on SNL  He was stiff  And he was like  Don't fuck this up 
[02:00:30]  Wow  So that's like  As a comedian  I can just tell  Oh he knows  He's gonna lose  He knows he could lose it  So that's why  They're acting the way they are  It's yours to lose  So  Keep it cool  Keep it stiff  That's the worst thing  To say to a performer  Yeah yeah  It's yours  Yeah you got  You got this  You got this  Yeah you got this man  Now that you said that  I don't  Jerry the pilot of the plane  Is sitting out in the audience  I just wanted you to know  You ever see that  Well you were on  An episode of Seinfeld  But the  One of the 
[02:01:00]  One of the ones  Where  How'd you get that  Yeah that is a great  Fucking  It's the coolest  Fucking thing  I wish I could tell  Annoying comedian story  I went in  Yeah I went in an audition  That's it  I wish I had a better story  That was a cool ass show  To be on though  But there's nothing worse  Than when you say  You did something  And a comedian  Is like  How'd you get that  Are they looking for people  Shut up  Shut up  There was  One of his  One of his  Like road managers  Was the woman  From that 70's show  The mother  And she was 
[02:01:30]  She'd always like  Nudge him  And he was going out  On stage  And out of nowhere  She goes  I don't want you  To be upset  Or nervous  Or anything  But the pilot  Of the plane  We were on  Is sitting in the audience  And he goes  Why are you even  Telling me  Like it means nothing  So he goes out  And he starts  Doing his act  And he turns  And looks at the pilot  And the pilot's  Looking at him  And he froze  He flops  Sweats  He runs backstage  He goes  Why did you tell me that  But it's one of those  Things where it's like  It could fuck you up 
[02:02:00]  Yeah  Just being told  Something like that  Don't put any thought  In my head  No  Just let me wander out there  Just do it  Yeah shut up  What did you think  Of Ron Paul there  Patton  I like  It's weird  How Ron Paul  It's like  Somebody tweeted  About Ron Paul  You know  He's just  He's 90%  Right  He's 90% right  Which is  My friend tweeted  And that's like  Going  Here's a great  Here's a great bowl  Of ice cream  With a tiny teaspoon 
[02:02:30]  Of dog shit in it  So that's funny  It is weird  How so many  Of the things  That he's just  He's destined  To be like  The Ramones  Of the new  Right wing  Of like  He had the ideas  First  And never got  To profit off  Right  Which is  Let's scale  This stuff back  Let's be  I mean  I'm all for  Let's put more money  In the infrastructure  Let's  You know  I'm all about  America first  Well you're gonna hear that  Tonight by the way  Yeah well  We'll see  I heard that though  During the campaign 
[02:03:00]  I swear to god  It's supposed to be  A new idea  What happened  Wait a minute  You know  You're talking about  Calling Al Sharpton  On his shit  I'm really glad  That I have  That my third album  We're on it  No my second album  Or no  It's my third special  Braggart  No I talked about  It's the beauty of being me  You don't have those dilemmas  Was I at the Oscars  Or the Emmys  When George Clooney  Said to me  No  It might have been  Sean Penn  But I was like 
[02:03:30]  So high on Obama  And I have a bit  Where I'm like  To me now  People are like  Well you're most  Really embarrassed by that  Like no  It's a historical thing  That's how I felt  I was so excited  And now I will  Deal  I can do  New material  About how  Oh that didn't quite  Work out the way  I wanted it  To or thought it  Like  When you're talking  About like  Calling Al Sharpton  On stuff  I wish  It was okay  For people to just  Be able to bring up  To David Duke  To Al Sharpton  And he went  Hey you did this  Really horrible thing  Like you got behind  An obvious lie 
[02:04:00]  And then have them go  Yep  I was young and stupid  And I fucked up  Right  And I know better now  For going through that shit  And I think  A lot of people would go  Yeah that's how you learn stuff  You do something really dumb  And you fuck up big  And then you get to  Where you're like  Oh okay  Now I can approach  And now I can approach  Things a little calmer  Right  Because I did  I was part of this  Huge disaster  I don't want  I actually don't trust  A leader that never  Had to go through a  Holy god  That I just screwed up  Wow that was a bad one  Wow  And then walk away  From that  That's where you get  Who does that 
[02:04:30]  There's not a human  On the face of the earth  That is of voting  Or electing age  Yeah  That hasn't fucked up  Somebody recently sent me  A link of something  I said about the Iraq war  I literally  Couldn't have been wronger  If I said  If I said we were  Going to fight Sweden  I would have been  More accurate  Than what I said about Iraq  What'd you say  I don't remember  But it was like  I will be out quickly  I literally  It's in and out  It's great  But you have to own that  And make fun of yourself for it  I was wrong 
[02:05:00]  It happens  Comedians  We're basically  We're magazines  We're issues of a magazine  You don't get an old issue  Of Time magazine  And then write them  A letter going  You said George W. Bush  Is president  And excuse me  But maybe you need to  Because Obama's president  Yeah that came out  You know that was  That's a five year old magazine  You idiot  So when people call me  On my earlier stuff  I'm like  That's exactly  I stand by it  Because that's exactly  How I felt at the time  But that shit changes constantly  And I'm glad  That there's a record of that 
[02:05:30]  There's a record of the  I mean  I'm delirious with hope  When Obama's about to be elected  Because A  I've been  I'm so angry  At the end of eight years of Bush  That I  I cranked up the hope too much  Like I'm literally  Assigning him super powers  That's how excited I am  And then  So you realize  Okay yeah  People  I was dumb  For getting wrapped up  In this stuff  You know  He is just as fallible  As anyone else  He's done a lot of good things  He's done a lot of stupid stuff too  You know  Yeah 
[02:06:00]  It would be nice though  If like  Other people  Politicians  They are the one people  That can never say  Yeah wow  I fucked up  Or let's look at what you said  Two years ago  It's like  Two years ago  I felt that way  You're right  Am I allowed  To maybe get new facts  Situations change  Why can't my opinion change  Based on  A changing situation  Yeah  But they will  Hold you like  Well you said that  Two years ago  And now you're saying  Something different  Oh my god  He's a flip flopper  We punish them  For being wishy-washy  That's our problem  As voters 
[02:06:30]  Or whoever does vote  We want people  That have crystal balls  That can read  Into the future  And know  What decision to make  Now  And not look like  An idiot  Four years from now  But don't you feel like  Maybe in the next  Not four years  Maybe eight or twelve  It'll take another  Couple cycles  There is gonna be  Some politician  That will rise  That will actually  Make  Make a weapon  Out of going  Yeah boy  Was I  You should have seen me  Five years ago  I was  And use that 
[02:07:00]  And now I know  And make that acceptable  And you know why I know  Because I got my ass  Handed to me  Yeah yeah  And this guy  Who's talking about it  In hindsight  But he doesn't know  I've been through it  I know  That'll be when the debates  Are like on HBO  And they could say fuck  Yeah  That'll be great  I mean  Well he fucked  The whole thing up  When he was in office  It's like  HBO  And then you're not like  The debates  Yeah  Hey asshole  You were the fucking  Motherfucker  That wanted that bill passed 
[02:07:30]  They started  I had no shit in your hat  They started that last night  And I was so waiting  For either Romney or Perry  When they were going  Well when your job  You created less jobs  Than do caucus  Yeah yeah  And if Romney just going  Yeah you know what  We tried that system  And it didn't work  And now I know better  Now I know not to do that  Now I know  At least I could say  I know one thing  That doesn't work  Yeah  That I won't try  And we'll never do that again  Yeah yeah yeah  Exactly  But they never do  I mean it was like  When people would bring up  That Robert Byrd  Was in the Ku Klux Klan  Yeah and realized  Later how stupid it was 
[02:08:00]  Maybe he didn't enjoy it  Yeah  No no  I bet he enjoyed it  At the time  But then he got a little older  And went  These guys are horrible  Yeah yeah  You know  Also I love how people bring up  He was in the Klan  The Klan is like  The least powerful  Like they're basically  It's a bunch of guys  With no jobs  They don't have any voting power  They don't  They're not  I love when they hold up  They're not a party  Oh the Black Panthers  Or the Klan  You may as well  Just bring up the Sharks  Or the Jets  They don't affect anything 
[02:08:30]  At least they can dance  Yeah  They don't affect anything  Well the Panthers probably could  Yeah that's true  A lot better than the Klan  It looks stupid  Two stepping idiots  Yeah  Oh the Panthers  All 80 of them  All 80  Boy when those guys get together  Forget it  And now you're talking  The old ones  Or the new ones  Because yeah  There's 40 of each  Oh my gosh  Yeah I know  I almost feel like  The Panthers and the Klan  Should just get together  Like professional wrestlers  Like okay this year  So in April you attack us  Yeah yeah  And then we'll  I'll call you out 
[02:09:00]  We'll do that  Just to get like  The fundraising going  I think they should go around  Like Liddy and Leary  Went around  And just go to colleges  And beat each other up  A little bit  People will be like  Wow I feel like I was there  It's wonderful  Hey not  The MMA should do that  They should go  Tell the Klan  And the Black Panthers  Get your  You have a year to train  Get your best guy  Oh man yeah  Get the best example  Of the white race  Get the best example  Of the white race  Let's put him in a ring  And see what happens  Oh yeah  Some skin headed motherfucker  And some big Tyrone  Motherfucker  And just go at it  Oh that would start 
[02:09:30]  That would start a race riot though  That would be like  Awesome  The second the one guy  Gets an advantage  Over the other guy  Oh yeah  I think society  Would just unload  And start fighting  Wait he's beating him up  Fight  Fight  Yeah well  Those guys  Those guys  Oh shit  Well Patton Oswalt is here  Yes he is  Finest Hour available now  On Showtime On Demand  Replays Friday at 9 on Showtime  And then the album comes out  September 20th

[02:10:30]  September 29th  Through October 1st  Tampa Improv  And I want to plug  This USO thing  Oh fuck yeah  That's a good thing  It's a 9-11 remembrance walk  It's the inaugural 5K walk  Through the heart of  Lower Manhattan  To remember and honor  Those who were lost  10 years ago  And it's Saturday  September 10th  It's 7  You can register  On site  7pm  7am  Oh  And it's at  Hudson River Park  At Pier 46  Between Charles Street  And the West Side Highway  So it's obviously  For a really good cause  Yes it's a good cause 
[02:11:00]  For the USO  Which does a lot of  Great things for soldiers  Yeah  You worked with the USO  Didn't you  Yeah I went with  Colin to Iraq  For the USO  How many people  Did you get killed  Nice  I bored a few  To death on stage  A few suicides  That's what I was  Fucking saying  They're like  This is the free speech  We're fighting for  Imagine that telegram  I'm sorry  Stop  Your son has died  Stop  It was out of boredom  At a Jim Norton show  Stop  No my parents got a telegram  Your son died  Two shows in a row  I think like 90 
[02:11:30]  90 of our guys  Joined Al Qaeda  After you  Strap a bomb to my chest  This is pointless  I'm fighting for this shit  I was doing  Christopher Walken  Impressions to the  Republican guard  Hey you guys funny  I like it  Holy shit  You got to go through  Iraq  Like actual  Yeah we went in  Through Kuwait  And then we flew into  We did Talil  Kirkuk  And Baghdad twice  And we were supposed  To go to one more place  Maybe it was Talil 
[02:12:00]  We tried to land in one place  But we couldn't  Because of the fog  So we had to do  Fog  We had to do two days  In Baghdad  Instead of one  There was one location  We lost  Scary  Did you take Black Hawk?  No  We took no helicopters  We took all  Oh god  With the  The fucking  Oh the Amphibious  No no no  The  Armored Personnel Carrier  C  APC  C-130  C-130  C-130  C-130 in every base  Every base  C-130  So they were big bases  Yeah and we had enough  Space in between each one  And there was one flight  Where we had to get  Diverted to another airport 
[02:12:30]  And that's when we hopped on  Ricardo Sanchez's plane  No  No this is in Iraq  Sorry I thought you were over there  And now we got to ride with him  He was running the  All troops  Oh yeah  In Iraq we got to ride with him  Was he clean or was he dirty?  Right  Stop happening  What a hack  But he was the top officer  Oh yeah  And so  It was really weird to watch his  Delta team get off  And fucking like  Secure the area  Before he left the plane  You mean it was weird to see  Real men Jimmy  Is that what you're talking about?  I literally  I couldn't have felt 
[02:13:00]  More like a fucking  They handed me a helmet  And a blonde wig  You're used to being  Handed a helmet  So I  And a blonde wig  To tell you the truth  Daddy  The beauty of Colin  Is we were doing the show that night  And Ricardo Sanchez  Is in the audience  And Colin  Just goes right to the  Mexican boxcar jokes  Oh shit  I couldn't believe  The balls on Colin  To fucking do  Fucking hilarious  Mexican boxcar jokes  To the fucking  Commanding officer  In Iraq  And the soldiers 
[02:13:30]  Did enjoy it  With guns  With guns  It was great  Great trip  So yeah we saw  A good piece of Iraq  Very cool man  Performed in his palaces  And uh  That's very good of you  By the way  Oh no no  I demanded money  I demanded money  I'm like  I don't take anything  On the arm  You take it for granted  But that is dangerous  You went  You put yourself  In a tad bit  Of harm's way  To bring some lofts  That's why  Jesse Ventura  Annoyed me so much  Pulling out that  Military card  Oh yeah  I know  I'm not  He did  I'm not as brave 
[02:14:00]  As those guys by far  But I did volunteer  To go into a war zone  You fucking cunt  Motherfucker  And he probably was  In a motor pool  In Saigon  The entire time  Probably the first  Chopper out in 74  Are you saying  That I wasn't  In this shit  Anthony  When you ask him  What he did though  He doesn't answer  No he doesn't  Because he was  A frog man  But he calls it  A navy seal  Because the frog men  Were absorbed  Into the new thing  Which called  The navy seal  So he says  He was a navy seal 
[02:14:30]  Which he never  And it could just  Be semantics  But bah  And I'd love to know  What he did  I don't talk about  My missions  What  I had to change  A tire once  For a corporal  It was unbelievable  The action  What happened  Where were you  Saigon  Till when  Till the chinks came  Then I left  When Charlie  I know he  He wasn't in any action  He probably tried to eat  A jeep like Clinger 
[02:15:00]  I went  That's where he got  His boa  Trying to get  A section 8  His ass  Was the Ho Chi Minh  Trail  His job was  To clean the foreskin  Of Sophie the horse  Even though that was  A woman  Hard talking  It's the proverbial  Piece of baklava  I love how everyone  On MASH  Had the most ridiculous  Vocabulary  In the end  These giant words  Isn't he a high school  Dropout from Toledo  That is true 
[02:15:30]  Yes  What does his name  Proverbial for  Looking back on MASH  The humor doesn't  Work for me anymore  No  I love a lot of the  Serious stuff they did  And we lost the MASH guy  Who  Who was it  It's in the paper  Who died  What  A guy who directed  MASH  I didn't recognize  His name  I like the ones  My brother always points out  The best chunk  The best run on MASH  The best era  Is when BJ  Before he grew the mustache  When Frank Burns  Was still there  Yes  Frank Burns 
[02:16:00]  Those episodes  Are amazing  And those are actually  A lot of them  Are really funny  Because those were the first  Where they would do  Episodes without plots  It was just  We're in the operating theater  And there's nothing really  Overall happening  It's just a bunch of  Little events  Yeah  They're kind of drinking  Or playing poker  Or something  And then they're in the OR  They're just trying to get  Through the night  And so like  This is great  There's no  They're not setting up  Any goofy jokes  It's just real life  Yeah  It felt really cool  Fucking Frank  They said that was one of  The greatest regrets  They had about MASH  They didn't allow Larry Linville  To develop as 
[02:16:30]  Who he was  Because he was a funny character  But they left him one level  And they could  Yeah  And they could have added  And I always say  If MASH were made today  The top comedian  Star on the show  Would fight to play  Frank Burns  And not Hawkeye  Because now  If you notice  The all comedian  The best comedian characters  People like Larry Sanders  And David Brent  From The Office  They want to play  The damaged assholes  And not the self-righteous  The guy that's laughed at  A little more  Yeah, exactly  And if you had like  If you made MASH now 
[02:17:00]  Like Will Ferrell  Would want to play  Frank Burns  And not Hawkeye  And who would be amazing at it  Because you could do  Great satire  I want  Oh god  When do we get to the point  Where we can make  War sitcoms again  Hogan's Heroes  I know eventually  Hogan's Heroes  Always made me laugh  Because it's like  Even as a kid  I didn't quite feel right  About  Hey, it's a sitcom  And there's swastikas in it  Yeah  It was just the oddest thing  It's like  Canned laughter's going off  And there's a picture of Hitler  And they're fucking 
[02:17:30]  Yeah  It's like  Hey, that's a little odd  Who the fuck was in charge  Back then?  To allow that to happen  It's a sitcom  About Nazis  It's a talent show  Being run by  Oscar Schindler  It's a little odd  Who was in charge  Of the network  No, the Nazis  Alright  They made him look  A little goofy  And stuff  Wasn't it the guy  That played Klink  Because I think his  He was Jewish  Yeah, he was Jewish  And I think some of his  Relatives died  In the first Holocaust  Werner Klemperer  Klemperer  And he said 
[02:18:00]  I'll take this role  But Klink can never win  He always has to lose  Yeah, he would be  The goofy guy  That always lost  He has to be the butt  Of the joke  Yeah, yeah  Oh, it would be great  If they wrote an episode  Where he had to  Actually kill  All of Hogan's heroes  Yeah  And look  Amon Gert  Is doing the eyebrow raise  He's a card  All right  He's a card  Hogan  Get your men  Have them dig ditches  Dig a big long ditch  In the woods  Hogan  She left a ring  In the tub  Candle after all 
[02:18:30]  That red dress  That shouldn't be colorized  What a nut  Do a slide  Every time Amon  Shoots out the window  The prop ricochet shot  And then he's talking  Like I feel like my bullets  It's like all like  Veil direction jokes  I feel like my bullets  Are just going two inches  And falling down  People are dying  It's horrific  Are we having a barbecue today? 
[02:19:00]  Not exactly  They were always trying to rig  The old ball bearing plant  To blow up  Hogan and his men  They'd have to go out  The tree stump  And come back  And again as a kid  I didn't quite understand  Like what they were doing  I was like  If they're out of the camp  Why don't they just fucking leave?  Just keep going  Yeah  I never understood heroics  Like you're a kid  So it's not like  You don't understand  What a guy that would  Have a mission  Or something  It's like  Hey they're out  Why don't they just fucking leave?  Yeah let's go  Why is he going back?  He's going back  I just remember that theme 
[02:19:30]  Of that show  Was a big part of my growing up  Because it just always seemed to be  Playing in the background  In the background  On some TV  With a drunk relative  Laughing at it  God damn  Why'd they lose?  I wish we'd had Hogan  But when I was in the Arden Forest  We could have used that  Son of a bitch  A tunnel under the doghouse  Look at that  It's lifting up  And the dog doesn't even care  Stupid Nazi dog  He likes him  See because even the dog's pleasant 
[02:20:00]  My wife doesn't fuck  Laughing  Yeah Hogan's Heroes  Was a  Well you know that  You know that we're  We're finally  We'll finally get over 9-11  As a nation  When in 60 years  They make a cheesy  Pearl Harbor style  Romance  Yes  Titanic style movie  About 9-11  Where it doesn't really matter  The horror of it  It's more the romance  Well there's a  There's a young stockbroker  Yes  In the tower  And he's in love  With a sandwich girl  And she's trying to work away 
[02:20:30]  So all that's happening  In the backdrop  Of that morning  That morning  And then they're  In the tower  As it collapses  And have to proclaim  Their love  Like you know  That's coming  You know that's  Maybe not soon  But that will happen  Enough time goes by  And we've always  Talked about this  I was  I was  And people took this  For granted  It's like  You watch a party  Going on  Or a little fair  And kids are sliding  Down this ship  That looks like  It's halfway  Into the lawn  And it's a water slide 
[02:21:00]  I know  I've seen  And it's the  Titanic ride  I know  And it's like  They made a ride  Out of a shipwreck  Where thousands  Died in frigid waters  The most horrific death  And then enough time  Went by  Where it was  An inflatable ride  That children  You know  And they're bouncing  Off the smoke's pack  And wee  This is fun  There's salt and pepper  Shakers you can get  It's the Titanic sinking  It's the Titanic sinking  It's the thing  Sticking up  Yeah I'm not kidding  So when will  The World Trade Center  Be like a ride  Where maybe even 
[02:21:30]  A bigger one  At MGM  Oh like  The Twilight Tower  Of Terror  Yeah  Oh my god  Something like that  Where it's like  Whoa hey  The World Trade Center ride  Look out people  If you told people  In 41 that  Oh yeah  This Pearl Harbor thing  This is going to be  A really cheesy  Romantic movie  Cheesy bad movie  What?  Oh yeah yeah yeah  With a young people  And she's a nurse  And he's a pilot  And they're kind of  In love on the island  Are you  This is  No this is horrible  I know people  They just died  No no no  Just give it some time  People will be cool with it 
[02:22:00]  They won't  No they will  They really will  Don't worry about it  Yeah  What was the last comedy  About a war that was made  Was it  I'll say  Not that this is a sitcom  But we've told  We had Chris Morrison  Young Lions  About the four suicide bombers  Oh my god  Oh four lions  I'm sorry  Alright  Four lions  Young Lions  Was brand up  Four lions was great  Was that really  I loved  Totally comedy  Yes  Yes  I know I saw it  It was great  It was great  Chris Morris  That guy  Any comedian

[02:43:00]  I think you have a movie  That movie was such a bomb  Jim Dorden cum shoe  Nobody  Nobody would finance that  No  The best part  I'd be pitching it  To like showing my managers  And having them  And not telling them  What it was  And then all of a sudden  The guy pulls his dick out  And sticks it  And they're like  What is this  And I'm like  Just reading something  Next to it  Not acknowledging it  Come on you two  Cut it out  We have work to do  It sounds fantastic  And I can't wait  To see it Jimmy  Get the phone  That would be 
[02:43:30]  That would be really great  To make like a  A very  A very sellable  Genre picture  But for some reason  It's just constant cases  Nothing  It's like  You're like a sword  Like a lord of the rings  But for some reason  People are constantly  Having angels  And every female  And it has nothing to do  With the plot  Like the main characters  They're just going  We have to find  The claw  Of the  Of the griffin  And then in the background  There's just guys  Having the noisiest  Most painful looking  Anal sex  Wizard cum 
[02:44:00]  And like  Really elaborate cumming  Like really  Like magical cumming  Like they'll cut to a scene  In a tavern  And for some reason  When they cut  It's just a close up  Of this hard dick  And they just  Pulls away  And they just  Pan over to their main characters  Now what did the wizards  Say  And they just  That's where you start  Right on  Just a fucking  Rigid hard dick  And then it just  Dollies away from it  And you  Focus onto the bar  Where they're talking  Or while I'm sitting  I'm sitting behind the desk 
[02:44:30]  And the guy comes in  With the big case  And I'm like  Well tell me what happened  And he's just sitting there  And he's just rolling  His cock in his hand  And he's telling me  What happened  And I don't acknowledge  That he's doing that  I'm just actually  Taking notes  Well where was this dame  And he's like  Well she came back  And I  Stoke it  No dirty language at all  Oh  It's fantastic  Radio G language  Yeah  Oh god  And every female character  Is pissing  Every scene  She's pissing  Every time she talks  And they never explain why  Every fucking 
[02:45:00]  Every interaction  With a woman  The lack of explanation  That makes it fantastic  That's the best  She's squatting over  A bedpan  Pissing  I have an idea  This is one of the most  Amazing depictions  Of the Cuban Missile Crisis  Why  Is there constant  Golden showers  Was that a part of it  I mean  You got the Kennedys down  On the tension  But  And you cut away  To gay sex  And it has nothing  To do with  I don't understand  Jack and Bobby  Talking in the Oval Office  And just on a  On a fucking chair 
[02:45:30]  Just  Like blurry  Because the  The fucking  The depth of field  Is so great  That is very blurry  You just see a head  Bouncing up and down  On a hard cock  And a guy who  What are we gonna  What are we gonna do  About this Bobby  A guy who looks like  Lyndon Johnson  From a distance  Is being blown  By somebody really young  The fucking  Bruce Jeff and Kennedy  Are talking through  A glory hole  For no reason  Then your manager  Goes  You got these  Blurry guys  In the background  Having this horrible 
[02:46:00]  Anal sex  And they go  Give me  Give me 24 hours  And we cut it  They're in the foreground  In sharp focus  And the Kennedys  Are blurry  America  We've gotta tell  Castro  No you idiot  What are you  Why am I  Holy shit  We're gonna blockade  And crystal clear  Anal sex  It's all double entendre  Like you show  You show a TV  With Kennedy going  And if those missiles  But in the foreground  Is a guy's big hard cock  Being jerked off  By somebody else  I love the glory hole 
[02:46:30]  Here's the pictures  That you two spy planes took  These are obviously missiles  Fucking rigid dick  Yeah  Being snapped against  Firm stomachs  The glory hole  Is what again  What'd you say  Bruce Jeff and Kennedy  Are cutting their secret deal  But making eye contact  Through a glory hole  Like the hotline  But while penises  Are trying to come through  Like they're still  Keeps knocking  In the cheeks  They're so trying to sincerely  Get out information  It hits them in the cheek  And the mouth  Yeah yeah yeah  They're pushing them away  They don't even get angry  They're like  Come on  Get out of here  Move along 
[02:47:00]  Move along  Let me try to explain  The gravity of the situation  Not now  Let's say  Let's say Bobby's ass  Is the port of Cuba  And let's say  This guy's hard cock  Is the Soviet fleet  Now the fleet  Is trying  Why is he explaining it  This way  If these then are  Your missiles in Turkey  That are hitting me in mouth  You must take them out  Hoover's on the phone  And Clive Tolson  Is just waving his cock  In his face  Why is that so compelling 
[02:47:30]  Never references it  Never  Never  They just do all the dialogue straight  And it has like  Crucial information  But the whole  And the trailer for it  Is cut like a complete  Historic movie  No gay sex  What the fuck is happening  When you get there  There's a surprise for you  Or they reference it  Like Clive is swinging his cock  And he's going  And Edgar goes  Please  And he just goes  And he stops making noise  And he just keeps  Waving his cock  Please

Yeah  What are we calling him?  He wants to punch up  The Cuban Missile thing 
[02:53:00]  He has some add-ons  We might want to ask him  About your movie Jimmy  He could get this done for you  Yeah  He could work it  Right now the working title  Is Crisis at 62  But he may want to change that  Crisis at 62  Did you guys see Red State?  You guys saw Red State?  Yeah  Red State was good man  It looks great  Really fucking cool  Really good movie  Goodman's great in it  Nice  Kevin Pollack  But Michael Parks  Yeah Michael Parks  Is the show stealer  As they say  Is it on DVD?  It's on demand 
[02:53:30]  It's on demand  I watched it on  I rented it off iTunes  Yeah I demanded it myself  I went to  Kevin Pollack has a great scene  I do not want to  No I wouldn't wreck it  Oh boy  It's fantastic  It's like  One of the scenes  You're like  I wish I could do that  I love Pollack  Yeah he's great  Well why don't we say  Hi to Kevin  Kevin Smith everyone  We're discussing Red State sir  And uh  You guys watched it already?  Fuck yeah  Kevin uh  How convenient that you could watch it  In the comfort of your own home 
[02:54:00]  You could pause it  You could go take a dump  You could grab something  And eat  Come back  That improves the movie  Right  You're so right  You can't pause  And if you want to get up  You're like  Fuck I'm out of the experience  If you're at home  You can sort of take a dump  If you go to the right theaters though  Without missing the movie  Which is you know  I just watched it  Last night  Or the night before last  On demand of course  At the home  It was very  Very comfortable  Like you said  And uh  Amazing movie 
[02:54:30]  First of all  Overall just an amazing  Fucking movie  It looks great  It's got a look to it  Where  I really don't believe  You directed it  That was  I  I  I'm teasing  Wow  Wow  No it  That was part of the idea  The idea was like  Look  I can make a Kevin Smith movie  In my sleep  In fact some critics  Have accused me of doing this  It's in my genetics  It's in my DNA  I know how to do that  Right  But  Those aren't the movies  I dream about making 
[02:55:00]  You know what I'm saying  Like I don't dream about  Making a Kevin Smith movie  Because lord knows  I can do it  I dream about  Megan Quentin Tarantino movies  Well let me tell you something  Yeah  I think you're hitting on something there  That's for sure  Because uh  It was  It was  Just a great fucking movie  Overall  Thank you  And then  Fucking Michael Parks man  Where was  Where was this guy from  Then came Bronson  To the time  Tarantino picked him up  Uh  What was it  What was he in Japan  Doing commercials  No he was 
[02:55:30]  He had a kind of run in  I guess  With the industry  With uh  The guy that ran  Universal  He must have  Really fucked up  Because he's  An amazing actor  In this  We were just  You know what he is  Dude  He's the absolute truth  And as much as  He believes in the craft  He's like one of them  Brando types  But probably wouldn't have  Even done  Half the work  Brando did  He just like  He's so  He's all acting  Dude  We were talking about  His character  In Red State  And he's  All at the same time  Fucking frightening 
[02:56:00]  And charming  Yeah  And like soothing  But that's how  You got  That's how hatred works  Hate speakers work like that  Oh I know  I see it in the mirror  Every day  Believe me  Jesus  Morrible person  Country behind him  Simply by  Being a silver tongue devil  And that's what  Our Abe and Cooper is  Like he presents  Like your grandfather  Or a favorite uncle  And then when he  Starts speaking  It's all hate speaking  You'd want it  You wouldn't mind  Him babysitting your kids  I'm not saying that  In a funny way  I mean  He was so charming  With the kids 
[02:56:30]  Yeah  I'm like  I like that  Where he sends the kids out  It's like oh yeah  It's grown up  What does he say  It's grown up time  It's about to get grown up  Yeah it's about to get grown up  I want to hear all about  Your school  Yeah yeah  He makes them go  But it's like hey  I'm still  I want to hear about you  That little touch  Like oh yeah grandpa  And also  He probably really does  Want to hear about this  Of course he does  He cares  Like he is an involved parent  Even though he's a horrible  And it's moments from horror  Yes  And it's just  What an amazing movie 
[02:57:00]  You whipped up there  Kevin  Great  Wait a sec  I know who I'm talking to  Oh Anthony  You got a lot of people today  You got Patton Oswald in studio  Nick Schwartzen  I recognize that voice  Oh  Kevin hi  It's Patton Oswald  From Basic Cable  How you doing  How are you  I'm good  Hey listen  When you were shooting  The scenes with Michael Parks  Just as a  For you as a director  Were you  Were you having to stop yourself  From like  Jumping up  And just giving high fives  Like  Did you know what you had  When you were shooting 
[02:57:30]  That  You must have been going  Oh my god  This is gonna be  Look  I knew what we had  Before we shot it  That's why I could make  A movie like Cop Out  Because I'm like  I got Red State  In my back pocket  It doesn't matter  What y'all say about this  Because I'm gonna come back  With the thunder  And now when directing him  I didn't even direct him  Dude I can't take credit  For that performance  You don't direct  Michael Parks  The man's been acting  For what  50 years  He's forgotten  More than I'll ever know  Right  My direction of Michael Parks  He'd do  Like you look at that sermon  He's in the  Submarine  He dropped that sermon  We did it in three parts 
[02:58:00]  And he just went  From top to bottom  Of the three parts  When we were done  With the first  Of the three parts  I said cut  I walked over to him  And I was like  Oh my god  And I just walked away  That was my direction  Oh my god  He had the script  For about two months  And he kind of  Worked on it by himself  He figured out  His choreography at home  Oh my god  So much so that  When he showed up  On the set  He laid it out  Like a dance floor  Like with little steps  On the floor  To show us where he'd be  At every particular moment 
[02:58:30]  The dude was  Absolute truth  If you hate  Red State  You can't hate  That dude's performance  No it's amazing  I hate Kevin Smith  With the fire of a thousand sun  Even those cats are like  This dude Michael Parks  Is brilliant in that movie  It is one of those things  Where yeah  Even if  Yeah that's right  Even if someone  Doesn't like the movie  No one can go  And Michael Parks sucked  No  Or John Goodman  Or Melissa  And Goodman was great  Yeah  Oh Goodman was phenomenal  Yeah  Yeah  And so many  Surprises  And things 
[02:59:00]  Where you're just left with  I love  Holy shit moments  And the movie's got those  Where you're just like  That did not just  Fucking happen  Also  You know what it is  I'll be honest  It's not  It's not strictly a movie  I cheated greatly  I cut corners  And I broke a lot of  Film school rules  It's more of a parlor trick  And with a lot of  Great acting in it  Well it worked man  It almost feels like  A great expanded play  In a lot of ways  Yeah  Oh that's nice  It's very  To me you know  What it feels like  Experimental film  I never got to do one 
[02:59:30]  I made Clerks  And then from that  Moment forward  They were like  What do you want to do next  And I just started  Making regular movies  But I didn't  Learn anything  Prior to Clerks  That was my first movie  So I went to film school  In front of people  For like 20 years  And I never had that cool  Like oh let me go to film school  And make an experimental film  Somebody described it  They saw Red State  And they were like  This is like an experimental film  As if made by the teacher  Instead of the student  And I like that very much  It's good man  Honestly like it's  Hands down the best film  I ever made  You won't see 
[03:00:00]  A better performance  This year than  You'll see from Michael Parks  Or John Goodman  Even the kids  The kids  But Harry Bichet  That chick  There's babies in the attic  Oh yeah  She was great  She was fucking really good  Phenomenal  And then Affleck  He's making this movie now  He's making an Oscar bait movie  Called Argo  For Warner Brothers  About dudes  When the Americans  Were hostages in Iran  There was a film crew  That tried to get them out  It's a really interesting story  Oh wow  Oh wait a minute  That's the one  It was in Wired  I think 
[03:00:30]  They covered it  It was an article  It turned into a book  And now it's a flick  But he went through  And he asked me to borrow  A print of the flick  He'd never seen our flick  He was like  Can I borrow a copy  That's all I got  We didn't make DVDs  All I have is a print  He goes  Alright I'll borrow a print  He borrowed the print  And then I never heard from him  He'd never called me back  Never sent me  I thought he was just like  This blows  And you know  That was that  And then I read  In Variety  He cast John Goodman  And then he cast  Cary Bechet  And then he cast  Michael Park  So I said to the producer  I was like  What's up man  Is Rick don't want to 
[03:01:00]  Call me back or what  And then Ben emails me  The next day  And he's just like  I thought you'd already  Got my message  But if you can't tell  Based on the fact  That I've cast  Half your  I like your movie  Hey Kevin  You gotta explain  The marketing  To Red Steak  Because a lot of people  Confuse that  It's not just coming out  As a regular movie  In all the theaters  Well nothing about the movie  Has been conventional  So we just keep  Altering it  That's what's made it  Kind of fun for me  And profitable  Basically by staying away  From all that  Traditional nonsense 
[03:01:30]  Or marketing commercials  Spending money  Oh man  Blah blah blah  We weren't profit  Long before we started  Showing in theaters  So the movie right now  I took it around  Remember 15 cities  Back in March  We toured it that way  Like a rolling road show  Then we came out  On VOD last week  So everyone can  Literally watch it  In their homes  Now September 25th  We go to theaters  If there's one theater  That I'm based out of  In L.A.  Quentin Tarantino's  New Beverly  Where we'll do the movie there  Show it there  And I'll Q&A there 
[03:02:00]  But that is going to be  Streamed into 50 theaters  Across the country  So even if you're  I'm not  Like you can go to  You can go to New Jersey  Sit down  Watch the flick  And it's streamed into you  Then after the movie  The Q&A is streamed to you  I'm sitting there  Q&A  You can interact with me  And then we do  A Hollywood Babylon podcast  At the end  So for me  It just doesn't make sense  Anymore  Like I know how I watch movies  I got my laptop open  I got a movie in the left hand corner  I got my Twitter on the right  I got my  I chat with my wife  In the middle  And I'm answering an email 
[03:02:30]  Over here  And it's unfair of me  To be like  Hey you everybody out there  Put your shit down  And come to my movie  And look at it  And I'm not even going to be there  But  It's not for this movie  This is a special handling movie  It's weird  It's not the kind of movie  Where you can put like a commercial on TV  And people go  Oh I got it  It's just  It's different  So different movies require different handling  I didn't want to go through  The traditional expensive way  So I said to myself  Look  I'm going to take it out  And I'm going to make it worth it  If I'm going to ask you to come out of your house  I'm going to stand there next to the movie 
[03:03:00]  I'm going to keep delivering  So we did like  90 minutes of movie  And then two hours of Q&A  Afterward  Now for this September 25th thing  Same idea  We do 90 minutes of the movie  And we do  I think it's another 90 of Q&A  And then podcast as well  So for me  I'm like  If I'm going to ask you to leave your house  The comfort of your home  And sit down in a movie theater  We're going to make sure  It's more than just the movie  If you watch just the movie  You can watch it on VOD right now  So for me  It's about making it interesting  I love standing next to the movie 
[03:03:30]  I'm proud of it  It's the first thing I've done in years  Where I'm like  Fuck yeah man  This is mine  Say something bitch  I'll punch anyone  I'm happy to attend  Screenings with it  Every public screening  Exhibition of the movie  While we're on the road  I was at  Like I thought  During the flick  I'd go out back  Smoke  Or go on a bus  Smoke weed  While the movie was playing  But I never left  I sat there with the audience  And I'd tweet churn it  I love the movie  It's gross how much  I love the movie  So for me  The movie isn't just the movie  Like anyone can make a movie  I like to make the theatrical experience 
[03:04:00]  More intense  Like more satisfying  It may give you a reason  To come out of your house  And spend some bucks  So I keep packing it on  So I don't want the movie  To simply go out to movie theaters  Without me  Like if people just want to see it  That's why I said fine  Put it on VOD  That way I don't even have to  Leave their house  Yeah yeah  Oh that was  Believe me  To a theater to see it  I'm going to be standing there  Right next to it  Or streamed in right afterwards  Because I believe in giving you bank  That's really the way  I watch movies these days  Is just at home  Why the fuck 
[03:04:30]  Why the fuck go home  What are the movies  You leave the house for  The event pictures  Something big  Something worthwhile  Oh the Sandra Bullocks  And the  Yeah  All those sweet movies  I like any movie  Where the guy and the girl  Are standing back to back  Looking over at their shoulders  And going  Ah you  That'd be a great movie box  Posted for a movie  About the Kennedys  Jackie  Jackie and JFK  Like leaning back to back  Looking at each other  Like oh you  He's dripping his head  On her shoulder  Oh right whatever  Kevin there's a moment 
[03:05:00]  In the movie  When the  I won't spoil the moment  But there's a moment  With John Goodman  And anyone that hasn't seen it  You'll know the moment  When it starts  Yeah  That is  When the stuff starts going down  Him as the ATF agent  Does something  That is so  Awkward  And realistic  That you're  It amazes me  That more people  Haven't put that  In their movies before  Because that is a thing  That a guy in his position  Would consider  And go  Do you know  What I'm talking about  I agree 
[03:05:30]  In code  I absolutely  Yes  You'll know  When it starts happening  And you'll realize  How  Kind of clumsy  And fake  A lot of movies  That you might have liked  Up to this point  That never address  That aspect  Of being an ATF agent  The fact that it got put  In this movie  I was like  Oh yeah  Wait a minute  That should be in  That would be on  Every ATF agent's mind  Of course  That's the first thing  They would think about  Actually  And no one ever  Puts that in their movies  We get to play  With the history  And things that have  Gone before  Like look  At the end  Some people have said 
[03:06:00]  Oh this movie  The message  Blah blah blah  Look  As far as I'm concerned  I'm the writer  The only message  Of this movie  Is hey  Be nice to each other  Other than that  It's just a series  Of like  Isn't this fucked up  Look at this  Did you think  It was going this way  It's going left  Like that's how  I wrote it  Every time  I knew where  The movie was  Going  I was like  That means  The audience  Is ahead of me  So fuck it  I'll change  And so  The movie  Is like  Three movies  Jammed into one  It's a mashup movie  And every ten minutes  We try to alter it  So that just when  You're like  Oh I know  What's going to happen  Now this dude's here  And then he's his buddy 
[03:06:30]  And they're going to  Take these guys  This dude's  Definitely happening  Oh yeah  And the whole thing  Is designed to keep you  Off balance  It's to keep you  Just never  Let you get comfortable  As an audience member  The moment I'm ahead  Of the movie  I get comfortable  I think about other things  So I figure  If I can just  Stay ahead of the audience  Every step of the way  By throwing out  Lefts and rights  And rope-a-doping them  For example  This doesn't spoil much  But at one point  In the movie  You see the time 
[03:07:00]  Writ large on the screen  The actual time  Of like I think  It's 4.47  Means nothing  Yeah  Has nothing to do  With anything  But when it happens  You're like  Oh everybody remember that  It's very important  Because they wrote it  Big on the screen  It's like no  But no it has  It never comes back  It's not useful  Mental patient  It's just made  Like thrown in there  To get you off kilter  So that we can  Throw right  Without you seeing it coming  It's a rope-a-dope movie  You do do a lot of stuff  Like there's a very famous  Moment at the end  Of To Live and Die in L.A. 
[03:07:30]  That everyone in this movie  Was like  Wait what  But that happens  Every ten minutes  In Red Sea  We're like  Wait  So I thought  Oh so that's not  Oh god  What  Who is  There is that  There is no  Comfortable rut  There isn't  Like is this going to be  An action move  Well sort of  But then  Oh whoa  Whoa whoa whoa  Yeah we keep calling it  A horror movie  That's because  And I stand by it  Because I'm like  Look  Everything that happens  In the movie  Is horrifying  It was directed  That way  Like you  First of all 
[03:08:00]  Like I said  I didn't believe  It was you directing it  Because it's one of those movies  It's like nothing you've done before  As far as directing goes  Because there are shots  Where it's very claustrophobic  And then other shots  Where it's  You're almost moving  In your seat  Trying to look  What's around a corner  Before you got the camera there  Oh that's all  Like it was  It was that kind of  Directing  And then that odd  Camera on the person's face  As they're running through  Yeah  Which gives it that  Really strange  Someone's fucking 
[03:08:30]  Chasing me  Yeah  Look  And this is something  Like I said  Never seen from you before  Were you just sitting  On it for fucking  20 years  Or  What is  Some folks have been asking  But honestly  Think about every movie  I've made prior to this  This style wouldn't have matched  There's no movie  I've made  Obviously yeah  That really requires  A visceral kinetic visual style  I made movies  Stoners sat there  And talked to each other  And like  I remember  When was that  People were like  Oh you've got to move the camera 
[03:09:00]  So on Clerks 2  At one point  Dante and Randall  Are outside having a conversation  And I'm doing a 360  With a camera around  And I remember going  This is ridiculous  Why am I  This is so stupid  Just because  Like a bunch of critics  Are like  Move the camera  I move the camera  And it's unmotivated  It makes no sense  It takes you out of the scene  Because you're like  Wow that camera guy  Didn't trip once  I never felt like  Oh let's put on the style  There was no need  Plus to be honest  For the first 10 years  I was learning my craft 
[03:09:30]  Like you know  Like got me in the door  But I had to go to film school  In front of people  So with this movie  I always knew like  You know  This is going back  Five years ago  I said hey  I'm going to write  This movie Red State  And that was the movie  Where I was like  Look with this one  I'll show them  That I could do  One or two things  People love to reduce you  Stick you into a little box  Even if you accomplish something  That billions of people can't  The moment you accomplish it  They're like  Well you only do that  For years  Yeah what's next  You do James Bond  Bob movies  That's it  And it's like  Okay I do  And I love James Bond  Bob movies  But bitch  I could do a lot more 
[03:10:00]  And here's one  Pa-pow  And you give it to them  Right before you're leaving  Like I'm on my way out  Hit somebody  The next movie  Is the last movie  I want to make  So I also felt like  On my way out of directing  I might as well show them  The like  Yeah I mean I guess  I could have made  A bunch of cool movies  If I wanted  But all I wanted to do  Was make view-as-kew movies  Like I love connecting those  And now you're going to do  Paul Masson wine commercials  That's right  I'm like  It's no wine  I'm like  He doesn't say anything  I'm going to do wine though dude  I'm in LA  So it's going to be weed  And it's going to be like  We will serve no weed 
[03:10:30]  Before it's done  Kevin I've got to say  In Red State  The  And I was  I was a little leery  But the  The Jay and Silent Bob cameo works  It did not take me out of the movie  It was something hammered in there  It was weird  It didn't take me out of the movie  At all  But there is  To be fair  To be fair  They're not in the movie  But they are in the movie  You know what I'm talking about  At the end  There's a reference to  Kids over the hill  Uh huh  No no  I could  By the way  Did this movie  Come out of any of the weirdness  You went through  When you did Dogma  No not really  Because they're not 
[03:11:00]  Like Catholic weirdness  Is not like  Christian fundamentalist weirdness  Oh okay  Catholic weirdness  Is very judgmental  And how dare you  Jesus would be ashamed  And Christian fundamentalism  Is way worse  And way deeper than that  They take it way more seriously  Catholics  Kind of  You know  They're very Catholic  And religious on Sunday  Other than that  You know  They live  Fairly normal lives  So  This came more from  The Westboro Baptist Church  Yeah  Idiots for years  And years  And years  Finally I was like  Well  If they could go to a funeral  And hold up a fucking sign 
[03:11:30]  And make someone's worst day  Of someone's life  Even more miserable  Then I think I could do that  A different version  Where I hold up my sign  To them living  Fuck their funeral  Do it while they're alive  And bug them  And it did  It bugged them so much  Like Shirley  Phelps  Roper  And her daughter  Megan Phelps  All the Phelpses  Came after me  On Twitter  And shit  And Megan would be like  You're gonna burn in hell  She's like the 25  26 year old Phelps  Yeah  The most  She's cute  I actually jerked off to her  The hot one  She's a fairly attractive Phelps 
[03:12:00]  And I would write back to her  Like she'd be like  You're gonna burn in hell  And I said Megan  My wife says  If it'll save you  From your cult family  We can have a three way  I'm learning with her  Like that  And then her mother gets in  You're a pig  You're going in hell  And all this stuff  And we interacted with them  For a  God  For the better part of a year  Because they kept  Coming to  Like they came to  Sundance to protest  The movie  Nice  When it first screened  And then when we screened  In Kansas City  The Midland  They lived near  By in Topeka  They came to protest there  So the movie 
[03:12:30]  Was kind of  About them  Or people like them  And they kind of  They fell in love with it  I call them my  Marketing partners  Because they help us out  We didn't spend any money  Putting the movie out  But when Phelps  Just show up to protest  Yeah  Yeah  That's huge  You know  I don't  I wouldn't say  I owe them  Or even I owe them  A dead gratitude  But I do owe them  At least a thank you  From time to time  Like thanks for  For calling attention  To our movie  Which is kind of  About you guys  Indirectly  It's fantastic  Like I said 
[03:13:00]  I just watched it  A couple of nights ago  And it's  I'm definitely  Going to watch it again  It's got that  Rewatchability  Just for the  Performances  I wanted to make  Like here's  I spin Fargo  At least once a week  Oh please  Yes  Of course  And there's a lot  Of Fargo influence  In that movie  Particularly like  The John Goodman half  When he wakes up  Straight up Fargo  Yeah  On the side of the bed  Right  You gotta have  A breakfast  Totally  I wanted to make  A flick where  People would  Spin this movie 
[03:13:30]  The way I spin Fargo  Like oh my god  I got nothing else  To watch  I'll totally watch  Red State  Like a cool movie  Like I remember  Popping in  Kill Bill  A thousand times  When I got it  On DVD  Like and no matter  What else was  I was like  Oh I love this movie  I'll watch it again  And I still watch it  Regularly  That's what I want  For Red State  And I know  I feel that way  About it  I think others can too  That's very cool man  And again  Michael Parks  His performance  We're trying to get him  Nominated  We had a run out  He has to get nominated  We're trying  We had a run out  In order to qualify 
[03:14:00]  An actor for the  Academy Awards  There's certain rules  You have to follow  And hoops  You gotta jump through  And one of them  Is you have to play  For one week  Standard week of play  In Los Angeles  In a theater  And you have to  Take out a paid ad  Which we hadn't done  So we took out  Three paid ads  One in the LA Times  A small one  One in the Village  Not Village Voice  What kind of  Grease the industry  Shit is that  No kidding  It's a rule  That's stuck around  From way back  In the back  That way you can't  Like I can't run you  For the Academy Awards 
[03:14:30]  You have to fall  Under these  Unless you're  Oh darn  Well there's a third  Thing too Kevin  The director has to  Pass a drug test  I think that was the  Oh  I'm pulling myself  Out of the run  Oh okay  I don't want any  Like here's my  The only way  I can get Parks  Nominated  Is if I go out  And there  Because there's a lot  Of people who are like  Fuck Kevin Smith  And his stupid  Fucking movie  And his mouth  And shit  So in order to  Get past those people  And they're like  Fucking cancer  They'll be with us always  In order to get past  Those people  I have to lay it down  On the sword 
[03:15:00]  And I have to tell  People left and right  Like I didn't direct  Michael Parks  Michael Parks directed  Himself  And that gives people  A remove where they're  Like alright  Even if I don't like him  I can still vote  For the dude in his movie  So we had this run  At the New Beverly  It was awesome  But rather than  Just stick in the theater  I did a Q&A  After each one  So we sold out  Like almost every show  And then you know  It followed that rule  Of playing in New York  Followed the rule  Of taking out ads  And now we're fine  All we have to do  Is lobby  What I figure  Like rather than  Most people lobby  The entire academy  All I want is acting nods 
[03:15:30]  I don't want anything  For me or anything else  I just want actor nods  So we're going to go  After SAG  And we're going to go  After the academy  And make the DVDs  And put them  Into everybody's hands  Hopefully by Thanksgiving  Because I'm an academy  Member too  And when it comes  To Thanksgiving time  I want a stack of movies  That's when I watch  All the movies  So I want to be part  Of other people's stack  Because I want people  Sitting around there  After Thanksgiving  Watching Michael Parks  Going like  This guy has to get  He has to get nominated  That would be great  It's the one  We had to play 
[03:16:00]  By the rules so closely  Because what's her name  Linda Fiorentino  She was in that movie  The Last Seduction  Oh that's right  Brilliant film  Fantastic  And she gives  A performance for the ages  Hands down  She should have been nominated  If not one  But because they played it  On Showtime first  And then went to theaters  The academy was like  Well technically  It's a TV movie  Wow  Didn't that happen  To Mimi Rogers  With The Rapture  I think it might  I don't know  If it did or not  I don't know  If they went TV first  I thought they were  Straight up theatrical feature  But she didn't get nominated  Which is another crime 
[03:16:30]  Yeah she was awesome  That movie is great  That movie has a lot  Of influence on Red State  If you know The Rapture  Well  Watch that  Watch Red State  And you'll go  Especially there's  One great scene  At the end of Red State  Again I don't want to spoil it  But if you've seen The Rapture  There's a great  Brilliant nod  To it  And then an even better payoff  And I'll just leave it at that  Even if you've heard  Of The Rapture  Yes  It's that  Oh that whole  That whole scene  In the payoff  Was so great  It's just an actor's movie 
[03:17:00]  I mean you get to  If you like performances  Like porn for performance  You just sit there  And watch actor after actor  Make unique  Wonderful choices  Believable choices  Like it never  Because we  You know  Did you notice  There's no score in the movie  Since there's no score  It plays more like a documentary  Docudrama  And it feels even creepier  Like we're never telling you  How to feel with a score  Uh huh  Here comes the scary  And blah blah blah  Holy shit  I didn't even realize that  What an adult  What an adult I am  You hear a lot of like 
[03:17:30]  Da da da da da da da da  And that's just repeated  Like boiler noises  Yeah yeah  You never did a score  I mean there's  Needle drop in the movie  Where you hear  Like a bit of a song  On a radio  In the sheriff's station  You hear a song  Yeah  And Park sings  About three times in the movie  Yeah  And that wasn't even planned  Like he sang the first time  And I was like  Oh my god  This guy's voice is beautiful  He's had a history  Of these recorded albums  I think he's had six albums  Or something  What  Yeah back in the day  He sang the song  From then came Bronson  Yeah he was the shit 
[03:18:00]  Back in the then came Bronson days  Like chicks fucking  All over the place  And uh  They called him the next  James Dean  Yeah  Because he was like  You know James Dean  Was difficult  And the same reputation  Got laid on me  Oh shit  So he sings in the movie  And he's wonderful  In the movie  You know it's fucked up  Wonderful thing  Let me finish  This is awesome  Oh fuck me  He sings this one song  I come up to him  I was like  Dude  That's fantastic man  And he's like  Thank you  Thank you  Next day on set  Everyone's singing a song  You're walking around  You hear people going  Father alone  And it's a church song 
[03:18:30]  And you're like  What the fuck  Are you singing that for  They're like  Parks man  That's beautiful  And I was like  Isn't it  It's hypnotic  So I went to him again  On another scene  I was like  Parks  Can you sing in this scene  As well  Like you're walking away  With Melissa  And you're comforting  Or a singer  Or a song  He goes  Alright I'll sing  Golden Bells  And he just rocks  This fucking church hymnal  It's beautiful  And I come to him  For a third time  At one point  In the movie  He's like  Parks  We could put a fucking song  You could sing right here  And he goes  Hold on  What is this  Some sort of  Fucking Elvis picture  That's a good  Comeback 
[03:19:00]  He goes okay  And he does it again  He sings  He acts  He talks  He does it all  And those are just songs  That he knew  Yeah those are  Old religious standards  But I wouldn't say  He necessarily knew them  Some he researched  The dude's a research freak  So he does his homework  And what not  So he knew definitely  Some of them  And on others  He was like  I found  Like I had in  In the script  It said  As you enter  The Cooper's  Subterranean Chapel  They're playing  A mighty  What is it  A mighty fortress 
[03:19:30]  Is our lord  Which is that  The song at the beginning  Of Davy and Goliath  Nah  Nah  Yeah  Nah  Nah  And he came in  He was like  Well that's Lutheran  We would never sing that  So let's sing  The old rugged cross  Instead  I said  What is it  He goes  Well it's an old  Gospel standard here  And he sent me a few bars  I was like  That's even better  It's creepier  Straightened our ass out  He had a head  In that world of music  So for having him  It was bonus  I'm telling you  The dude paid out  Insane dividends  Aside from his performance  He brought us music  And the ending line  In the movie  I don't want to spoil it 
[03:20:00]  But that was his idea  That was him  Yeah  Well that was his idea  He goes  I think you need to  I think someone needs to say this  And he wanted it to be me  And he wanted it to be me  On camera  And I was like  Well Parks  I can't do that  That'll pull everyone out  Of the movie  He goes  Why  I was like  Because they'll recognize me  He goes  From what  Oh  That's funny  I was like  Dude I had this whole other  Career back in the day  But  Oh my god  That's how it should end  He goes  You listen to this  Old man talk  This horse shit  The whole movie  You gotta end with that  And I was like  I'm so with you 
[03:20:30]  He was  He was the best  But the movie exists  Because of him  I saw from dusk till dawn  Back in 1995  And he's a sheriff  In the first town  I was gonna  I was gonna bring that up  That's what I was trying  To figure out  That scene  He was in the beginning  Of the sheriff  In the gas mart  Yeah talking about  The kid out on the  It's  Because he's so  Just standing there  I mean it's dialogue  From the movie  But he talked about  The quote unquote  Mongoloid on the grill  Yeah on the grill  Oh yeah  And you don't even know  What the fuck's going on  It's just cool dialogue  Between him and the guy  Behind the counter  Until he goes to the bathroom 
[03:21:00]  And then you realize  Holy fuck  Like they're on the brink  Of getting killed  And then he comes back  With the same thing  Like yeah that retarded  The grill  Shouldn't even be working there  And now you're just not  Like at first  You were entertained  By the dialogue  And his acting  Is just incredible  And then when he comes back  From the pisser  Now you're like  Holy fuck  This shit's gonna happen  Right right  Oh he would  That was amazing  Aside from  Like that's a well  Structured scene  Oh amazing  In terms of suspense  Intensity  But his performance 
[03:21:30]  Stood apart from  Any other acting  I'd ever seen in my life  And I'm a guy  Who appreciates acting  That's why I became  A director  You like being around actors  You like the idea  Of somebody taking words  On a page  Making it seem natural  And this dude  Like as much as I  Like I'd seen people  Where I'm like  Wow like I worked  With Alan Rickman  Dude's amazing  He made bizarre choices  That no other actor makes  Hans Gruber  Oh totally  That's all I know  Dude Parks  Is of that school  But he's like  Top of the class  Like this dude  Was making  Shakespearean choices 
[03:22:00]  In the midst of  You know what's  Essentially a little  Vampire movie  Yeah  He stood out  But not in a bad way  In a great way  He elevates the whole movie  While he's in  And the odd thing is  He's done in the first  Fucking ten minutes  I know  Of Dust Till Dawn  I know  He's done  And it was such  A memorable scene  He is the guy  Why is this guy gone  I know right  Holy shit  I said to Scott Mosier  I was like  Remember that old man  In the beginning  I said I gotta work  With him man  And could you imagine  Sitting at the acting  Feet of that Yoda  For like a month 
[03:22:30]  No shit  Wow  The things you'd learn  And I did  I learned so much  It was great  Him  Melissa Leo  John Goodman dude  Yeah  Come on  Yeah Goodman was great  Fucking great  Sweetheart to work with man  And all these Catholics  If I told you what John  What we paid John Goodman  To be in this movie  You'd kick me in the balls  And be like  He's an American treasure  You brat  He was in Lebowski  He deserves better  We did it for like  Four million bucks  And nobody really got paid  I didn't take his salary  You know  It's a labor of love  But it shows in the movie 
[03:23:00]  That's fucking cool  Hey  What do you got there  They're telling us  You gotta go Kev  They're calling me  Yeah  We're hearing you gotta go  Actually we're the fuck  Out of here too  I think it is  I think it is  I'm in Cleveland  I got nothing to do  Oh shit  What are you doing in Cleveland  Sorry to hear that  I came out here  And do a gig  It's nice  I like this  I'm not fucking with Cleveland  We love the people of Cleveland  Downtown area is a little rough  I hate their town  It looks like a set  For a zombie movie  There's nothing  There's no one walking around  There's malls  There's stores  Don't give Kevin ideas  Yeah  I think he just sold 
[03:23:30]  Red State though  It's on demand right now  And people  Sell it  They've just gotta see it  Watch it with your wife tonight  Or watch it with your husband  Don't watch it with kids  Cause it's fucked up  Yeah  But you could have like  Ten people over  And watch it for ten bucks  Man that's a buck a person  Yeah believe me  It's well worth  Just watching it yourself too  Not people yelling  And saying shit  And fucking eating  On the phone  If only I had friends  I love being alone  Watching a movie  Drinking my wine  Isn't it awesome dude  It was great 
[03:24:00]  Like last night  Not last night  The night before  Cause I was out here in Cleveland  I got done with all my work  It was like five o'clock  And I was like  Let's kick back  And watch Lebowski  Roll the fat joint  Watch it at home  And I was like  This is life  This is living  I'm the king of this bitch  Cause I'm layering my house  With what I put  From fucking together  From scratch and shit  Enjoying a goddamn movie  Smoking weed  I can't do that  Almost any place else  Yeah that's the shit  Anthony just painted  Such a lovely picture  I hate being around people  I like to just be alone  With my bottle  You know  Watching a movie  It took quite a while  To refine that whole thing 
[03:24:30]  And get it down  But I'm there  Yeah I just like to be there  Urinating on myself  In slippers  Watching an on demand treat  Exactly  That's what I do  But Kevin you said  It's in LA  September 25th  Well September 25th  If you go to  Coopersdell.com  Our website  They'll tell you  All the theaters it's in  Like I do it  From the LA theater  On the 25th  And then it goes out  To a bunch of other theaters  As well  So if you go to that site  You'll see  Like in New York  It'll be at the  IFC Center  And I think  A Lincoln Center Cinema  As well  Then there's places  In New Jersey 
[03:25:00]  Places in Pennsylvania  So it's  For me this is cool  Cause we do it once  If it works  Then we can do it  All the time  Like before the movie  Came out  We did at Smodcastle  We did this thing  Called the Red State  Of the Union  Q&A class  Where I'd show a scene  From the movie  From that movie  And then I'd bring up  One of the actors  And stuff like  We brought up Parks  You can go listen  To a two hour conversation  With Parks  On the Red State  Of the Union  Q&A over at  Smodcast.com  So we had a  Great time doing that  Fantastic time doing it  But now with this 
[03:25:30]  Movie theater thing  If this screening  On the 25th  Works out  Once a month  We could do this  Where it's just like  We go to the New Beverly  Show Red State  And then afterwards  It's like okay  For this month's Q&A  Ladies and gentlemen  John Goodman  And then we sit down  And talk to him  For an hour and a half  And that gets streamed  In the theaters  So for me  It ain't about like  The movie comes out  On DVD and we're done  I want to keep  Exhibiting the movie  For two years  As long as I can  Stand by it  Or be with it  Or whatnot  I can keep monetizing it  Because most people  Don't pay to see a movie 
[03:26:00]  When it's on DVD  But if I'm like  Hey man  Afterwards there's  Going to be a Q&A  They'll pay like  20 bucks  They'll pay a premium  He's taking  You're literally taking  Like the technology  That's available  And using it  How could we not  But nobody else  No one is really  Doing it yet  It is fucked up  Here's what I've  Thought about it  I mean Nick isn't  He's just got a  Standard regular movie  Coming out tomorrow  That's true  With a fake cock  It's Bucky Larson  Born to be a star  Oh is Nick Swardson  In there  Yeah  What's up man 
[03:26:30]  Nick how are you  I'm good buddy  How are you  Excellent excellent  He didn't want to  Give you any kudos  No I love Kevin  The whole time  We're talking to you  Or they're talking  He's just thumbs down  And we're like  But Nick  And then he made  The jerking off  Universal jerk off  They're joking  Totally  They're joking  No I didn't fucking do  No but I really  Wanted to see what  Red said  I wanted to see it  For a long time  And I'm really  Psyched to see it  So where did you  Find Michael Angarano  Michael Angarano  I saw what's his 
[03:27:00]  Name's movie  Jared was  Hess  I fucking love  That movie  So much  Yeah I love that  I was watching  That on a bus  One day  And I was like  The movie's really  Funny and offbeat  And what not  But Michael Angarano  Was just perfect  And I was like  God he looks good  And we had to  Convince him a little  Bit because like  Michael's older  He's like 20 something  And I'm like  Dude can you play  A teenager  One more time  Also Kyle Garner  We had to convince  Because Kyle had done  Like three horror movies  In a row  And he's like  I don't want to  Become a horror movie  Kid  I was like  This ain't a horror movie  He's like 
[03:27:30]  You said it was  I was like  Well that technically  Is because it's  Horrifying  But it's not  Technically  And Nick Braun  We found him  In auditions as well  He was in  Sky High  He's going to  That tall kid  With the pony  He had the long  Rat tail  He's going to  Play the lead  And hit somebody  Lead character  Buddy McCracken  That's the  Hockey movie  Yeah that little  Tease at the end  Like the whole cast  Is coming back for that  Yeah the idea  Of hit somebody  Is the last movie  I want to direct  So I'm going to do it  Like a Muppet movie  Like it's meant to be  My thesis  This is everything 
[03:28:00]  I learned  So in terms of cast  Since you followed  Somebody for 30 years  Of their life  That's a lot of life  And a lot of people  To put into the person's life  So I figure I'm going to  Pull from every  Cast I've ever worked with  It's meant to be  Like the best of  In terms of like  Hey look at this fucker  Hey look at this fucker  From all the movies  We've done and what not  Especially the last one  Like most of the leading  Cast comes from  Red State  Like Melissa Leo  Plays Nick's mom  And Stephen Root  Plays Nick's dad  Michael Parks is coming back  As a French Canadian  Hockey coach  Tough as nails 
[03:28:30]  He does a beautiful  French Canadian accent  Because he was on  Twin Peaks for a while  And so you hear  That's right  Yeah he was one  Of the Renault brothers  Yes  Oh my god  Him John Goodman's  Coming back  He plays a buddy's coach  When he's a youth  And what not  So I'm bringing  All those cats back  And I'm going to  Reach back into  The other movies  And pull those cats forward  You should grab some  People that have done  Cameos too  Because they'd probably  Be good  Jimmy you're in it  Jimmy doesn't believe it  Jimmy I told people  Years ago  That Jimmy will be  In the movie  Jimmy is going to  Play a Glenn Hall 
[03:29:00]  Like goalie  Who constantly  Vomits before the  Game  Nice  Nice  That is good  When is that coming out  Kevin people are asking  Which one  Hit somebody  Hit somebody  We don't  I just finished  It's going to be a while  I was going to make it  As one movie  But the script got so long  I was like fuck  It's my last movie  I'm going to do  Whatever I want  I'm going to make it two  I pulled a kill bill  And split it into two  So the first movie  Takes care of his youth  That covers all of his youth  Up until the moment  He's about to step on the ice  For his first pro game  And that's called home  Well it's his side name 
[03:29:30]  Home  It's called hit somebody  But we're calling that one home  The second one's called away  Because it's all about his life  Jesus  In the hockey  And professional  Kevin I've got to interrupt  We've got to get Nick out of here  For another interview  Hi brothers  Excellent talking to you  I'll see you  I'm going to be there in October  For like the New York Comic Con  And I'm doing a show  At the Count Basie  With Jay  Jay and Bob get old  So I'm going to come and  Sit down with you guys  If you'll have me  Cool man  We look forward to it  Congrats on the movie Kevin  See you soon  Congrats  I heard you coming on our show  When you're done  Yes  I'm finishing up a movie here  In New York

[03:36:00]  We've talked about you  I don't know if you  If you've been getting tweets  But  I've been mentioning  I started  You know  Kind of sneaking them in  Like I'd start the show  By saying  Woo woo woo  You know it  And sneaking them in  And yesterday  Especially  Zack Ryder  You're a WWE superstar  You gave me a happy birthday tweet  Two days ago  Which I mean  Set the Twitterverse on fire  Let me tell you  How big Zack Ryder is right now  Zack Ryder  He's a WWE superstar  You can see him on Raw 
[03:36:30]  You can see him on Smackdown  You can see him everywhere  Zack  You  Had a trending topic  On Twitter  That went all day yesterday  All day  All day  And into this morning  So technically  It was two days  Two days  The situation stole it  That poser  Yeah I noticed  I noticed you retweeted  The situation  Saying pound  Are you serious bro  Because that was  That's your  That's your catchphrase  That's my deal bro  I started that hashtag  In the morning  And it trended  And then situation  He goes and steals it 
[03:37:00]  It's unreal  And people were actually  Crediting him with it  I don't know who  They were crediting  But they were crediting  All day  I'm pretty proud of myself  You should be  Tonight when I  Yeah tonight when I  Go out to the club  I'm going to tell the girls  Hey you know  I had a trending topic  Yesterday  Got a lot of followers  On Twitter  And hopefully  I can pick them up  See for those of you  That don't know  Zack Ryder is a guy  Who's been in the WWE  For a little while now  And he was kind of  You know he was in  He was in a tag team  With a guy named  Kurt Hawkins  They were doing alright  And then they started 
[03:37:30]  Kind of not sure  Where we're going  With you guys  And Zack ended up  In a spot where  He wasn't getting  Any TV time  Is that right Zack  Basically zero TV time  Right  That's when I started  My own YouTube show  The True Long Island Story  And this is what he did  And this is why  I love Zack Ryder  Because he took  His destiny  In his own hands  He came up with  This character  Which I think  Is you pretty much  It's just a guy  From Long Island  I gotta tell you  When I first saw 
[03:38:00]  Zack Ryder come out  Repping Long Island  You threw up the L.I.  With your fingers  Saying woo woo woo  Are you serious bro  Take care  Spike your hair  And I got it  Because I live in New York  I'm in Long Island  All the time  I get it  I was a little worried  That it was a little limiting  You know what I mean  Like for a worldwide company  To be repping Long Island  That hard  But you made it work somehow  Yeah I made it work  I don't even know  What I did  I mean I don't have  Like a master plan  I just  I was a kid 
[03:38:30]  Who's doing a little  YouTube show  You know  Trying to get over  And I kind of worked  On my own t-shirt now  Headband  It was on Raw  I think I'm finally  Starting to get recognized  It seems like  Yeah you got your own  And I saw  You're getting  Your own WWE sunglasses  Coming out as well  Right  Yes  I have the prototype  And they're pretty  Pretty sweet  So people are actually  Going to be able  To start showing up  At events  Dressed like Zack Ryder  Yeah it's going to be crazy  It's got the headband  I think they're making a wig  It's like  It's unreal  Well where did you 
[03:39:00]  Come up with the character  Because before  Before he was  Long Island I.Z  Zack Ryder  Take care  Spike your hair  He was just a guy  With long blonde hair  And kind of  Generic tights  And he was just  Zack Ryder  You made this  Incredible transformation  Into this whole other guy  Was this all your  Idea?  Yeah I mean  I mean I was  Like you said  I was like  The long haired guy  Generic tights  It was Hawkins  And I were with Edge  Of course  Right 
[03:39:30]  And Edge  Once Edge  You know he got injured  Took some time off  But we were just  Left on our own  And we were lost  You know we were just  Two guys  Who looked the same  Kind of  And we really knew  Who we were  And I'm like  It just wasn't me  Like the long hair  I hated it  Like no girl  Like the guy  With a flicked back  Pony tail  At the bar  You know  Right  At least it didn't work  For me  I couldn't pull it off  So once we got the  Okay to go  By ourselves  I'm like  That's it  And started really  Being me 
[03:40:00]  And you always hear  Like with the volume  Turned up  But like  This is just me  Like 100%  So you really  Because like  In your promos  And in your  Online presence  And everything  You're shouting out  BSB  You know  You're shouting out  Pop music  Joe Jonas  Because you're not  You're not just  Limiting to like  90's boy bands  You're up with  Today and everything  Like you're really  Yeah I listen to  All types of music  And I'm not sure  I like the boy bands  I like Joe Jonas  Yeah  Who cares  I'd be great 
[03:40:30]  I mean I get a good  Cry to it  You know  You do  What do you  When you  So your girlfriend  Broke up with you  When you're trying  To get in touch  With your emotions  Like that  But you're  You're a massive  Professional wrestler  Your girlfriend  Breaks up with you  What are you listening  To to kind of  Tap into your  Emotional side  Lately it's been  The new  Jordan Knight album  It's really good  From the back  She actually tweeted  Me the other day 
[03:41:00]  The new  Jordan Knight album  I'm serious bro  Like  And I went on  Twitter  I said  Jordan Knight  Is the man  And he wrote  Something like  No no no  Zach  You are the man  So I guess  That makes you  The man  Exactly  I mean  Jordan Knight  Said so  Jordan Knight  Said so  So what do you  Think when people  Like kind of  Hate on  Backstreet  And new kids  Like saying  Look these are  Grown men up there  Dancing like they're  Still in their  Twenties  They're old people  By now  You're not in  That camp  Yeah you can  Hate on them  All you want  But when it  Comes on the radio 
[03:41:30]  You know all the  Words  You know you're  Singing along in  Your head  You just don't  Want to admit it  What's your  Favorite new kids  Song  Summertime  It's one of their  Newer ones  I think it was  Like 2008  So you prefer  Their newer stuff  I mean yeah I  Gotta do  Yeah they're more  Mature sound  You know the  Lyrics are a little  Deeper  So you feel like  New kids on the  Block have finally  Come into their  Own with this  New with these  New releases  I would have to  Say so yeah  Let me ask you  This Zack  Ryder  I was listening  To I  Listened to you  On Colt 
[03:42:00]  Cabana's podcast  And yeah and  Opie from the  Opie and Anthony  Show here for the  Last like three days  Has been giving me  Shit because I  Turned 28 on  Tuesday and I  Was getting you  Know Mattel  WWE action figures  For my birthday and  I wasn't making any  Secret about it but  He started and then  I was like you know  Am I weird is this  Like should I not be  Doing this but I  Turn on Colt  Cabana's podcast and  I hear that you too 
[03:42:30]  Are an action figure  Collector  Yes I do collect  Action figures  Right now I  Strictly keep to the  Zack Ryder ones  I also like  Ghostbuster ones  I have tons and  Tons of WWE  You know action  Figures they're just  All for my parents  House like  Thousands it's  Kind of pathetic  That's what I have  I'm living with my  Fiance now in our  Apartment we have a  Small shelf of  WWE action figures  But that's what my  Parents house is too  Just closets and 
[03:43:00]  Closets full of the  Old figures you  Though now you  Stick to Zack Ryder  And Ghostbusters  Right because I  Was getting out of  Hand you know what  Was I gonna do with  These things you know  So now I just stick to  The Zack Ryder and  The Ghostbusters the  New Ghostbuster ones  Are phenomenal I  Think  Do the guys in the  Locker room ever  Shit on you for it  No everyone knows  The deal you know  Everyone's a  Broski  How did people  Respond because  What you did on 
[03:43:30]  YouTube hasn't  Really been done  Before and  Generally like all  The WWE guys when  They're doing stuff  On the internet  We're doing it on  You know the  Official website and  Doing it nobody  Was being themselves  On their own  Personal YouTube  Channel I mean  Obviously now they've  Embraced it was  There trouble at  First  There wasn't any  Trouble but I mean  I was definitely  Kind of like hesitant  And kind of scared  But at the same time  I was like listen  They're not doing  Anything with me  So if I'm gonna go 
[03:44:00]  Out I'm gonna go out  Swinging you know  I'm like all or  Nothing this is my  Last shot and I mean  I wouldn't say it  Paid off but at least  It's finally been  Recognized you know  Monday Night Raw when  They played that video  Package before my  Match  Yeah and half the  Clips yeah most of  The clips were from  Your show  Right they're all from  My show so to know  That they actually have  Watched it and have  Recognized it it's like  I actually I had  Goosebumps like it  Was like that was the  First time I saw it  When it was live  And that yeah it was 
[03:44:30]  Great because like  WWE when they put  Together video packages  Like they spend  Thousands and  Thousands of dollars  On on the most  Up-to-date cameras  And and and video  Editors and putting  Everything together so  Professionally and then  Zack Ryder's video it's  Just the stuff you  Filmed on on your  Flip cam  Yeah my stupid  Little flip camera that  My parents got me for  Christmas that's what  Sucked it all  But you never uh you  Didn't ask them for  Permission before you  Started doing the uh  Long Island the true  Long Island story  I did not ask for 
[03:45:00]  Permission because I  Would assume they would  Have said no and so I  Mean that's that that's  The philosophy on the  Opie and Anthony show  As well is you don't  Ask for permission you  Ask for forgiveness later  And you can generally get  Away with a lot more  Um so how psyched were  You won um and like  People need to  Understand if you're not  Wrestling fans like  Zack was kind of was  Not getting tv time and  Kind of headed and and  You know don't mind me  Saying this Zack but was  Headed towards jobber 
[03:45:30]  Territory um and then  You come out on raw this  Week and not only do you  Have a video package you  Won  Yeah it was it was crazy  I mean uh this new girl  I'm seeing you actually  It was the first time she  Was watching it was the  Perfect night  Yes  She looked like a  Superstar  So  And so what do you put  On  What do you put on now  You got a new girl  You won the match  Well pump the brakes a  Little bit pump the  Brakes  Okay  Still single and ready  To mingle okay  Nice  It's just uh  It's a girl I took out  A couple dates  You know that's it 
[03:46:00]  Okay  So you got a girl on  Your arm for the night  You just you just won the  Match so what do you  Now what do you put  On the radio  Uh  Hmm what do I put  On the radio  I don't know  I haven't really been  On in the car lately  I'm to really do my  My show this week  I like  It's a 24 hour process  The show  The show you're just  Working nonstop  But that's the  Working nonstop  That's the way you got  To do it  Now here's a  Are you worried  Because before  You know you have  A lot of what 
[03:46:30]  Really brought you up  Is all these internet fans  Getting behind you  And it was also  Because like you were  An underdog  They were like what  Who's this guy  Who never gets TV time  You know putting out  This goofy uh  YouTube show  Wait this is hilarious  I'm gonna get behind  This guy  Cause it's kind of funny  Cause nobody else is  So I'm gonna  I'm gonna support him  Are you worried now  That you know  You're becoming  A little mainstream  Well no  Because that was the goal  You know like  So I mean  That was the point  All along  My goal wasn't  To be like  A little YouTube star 
[03:47:00]  Right  You know  It was to be on  Raw every week  And be a champion  And be like  The man  So if I lose  If I lose some of  The cult following  The underground following  Just because I'm  Successful  That's  That's idiotic  If they wanna  Stop blocking me  Because I made it  On television  Then  Then go  You know  And  But if they're gonna  They're gonna ditch me  Because I'm finally on TV  Then  As NSYNC says  Bye bye bye  That's  That's great to quote  NSYNC at this moment  And people need to  Look at you  If they're really 
[03:47:30]  Supporting you  Look  Are you sitting here  Talking about like  Indie rock bands  And stuff  That have a few fans  No  You're a mainstream guy  You're Mr. O-Town  And Backstreet  What do you  How do you feel  About O-Town  Oh they're horrible  You don't like O-Town  No they're horrible  Come on bro  They were manufactured  Did you hear that  They might be  You know  After  After NKOTB  Did a reunion  And BSB  Back together  That O-Town  I read on TMZ  Is getting back  In the studio  Yeah I'm not interested  Not at all  You're not even 
[03:48:00]  Gonna give them a shot  Maybe I'll listen to their  Single  But I'm not  Gonna download the album  Or anything  What do you think  Of JT  Leaving NSYNC behind  And becoming like  You know  This superstar on his own  Do you support his  Single  Yeah  Sure  Yeah  His stuff now  Is phenomenal  You like it  And you like his movies  His movies are good  I mean  Whether it's a social network  That was good  Yeah  It seems like  A lot of  Like you hear horror stories  About the locker room  Like you know  The Miz  Everybody's heard the Miz's 
[03:48:30]  Locker room horror stories  When he first started  Being this reality show guy  They were throwing him  Out of the locker room  And everybody was  Picking on him  And what not  I watch  I watch  The Long Island  The true Long Island story  On YouTube  And it seems like  Everyone in the locker room  Is supporting you  Because like  All these guys show up  On the YouTube show  Like  Cena's been on the YouTube show  And Randy Orton was on  You know  When you brought the flip cam  To the ring the other week  Is everybody  Everyone's supportive  At least to my face 
[03:49:00]  You know  Like  When I first started the show  Guys like CM Punk  And  And the Miz  And you know  John Morrison  They would retweet  My links on Twitter  And that just  At the time  I had basically  No Twitter followers  You know  So by  Like Cena  And all those guys  Retweeting it  That's how it kind of  Got out there  And  So I owe a lot  To all the guys  In the locker room  For helping me out  Your  Former tag team partner  Curt Hawkins  He  He's also from Long Island  Because  A guy named Pitsy  Who used to work 
[03:49:30]  For the show  That comes on after us  Ron and Fez  Is best friends  With Curt Hawkins  In real life  Yeah I know that guy  Yeah I know him  Oh you know him  How mad  Is Curt Hawkins  That you took  The sweet Long Island gimmick  And he doesn't get  To use this thing  I hope he's not mad  I mean  We  You know  I didn't do it  Like behind his back  We knew that our  Our time as a team  Was over  Yeah  And we both had  The opportunity  To create our  Our new selves  And you know  Because I'd be pissed  I'd be like  Not like 
[03:50:00]  Because you did  Anything wrong  But just because  You thought of it  And I didn't  And now you've got  All this  Everybody's buying  Your shirts  And everything  And following you  On Twitter  And spiking their hair  I'd be pissed  I don't think  The whole spike  In your hair  Is really the  Curt Hawkins way  You know  He has his own  His own style  His own way about him  So if he tried  Like spiking his hair  And doing what I'm doing  It wouldn't be authentic  You know  So I'm glad  Like he's sticking  To his guns  And you know  He may not  You know  Be on TV  As often  Right now  But I'm sure  He will be eventually  He's not a BSB guy 
[03:50:30]  I don't think so  A couple songs  One of our  We were a team  On the indies  One of our songs  Was  Entered songs  With my backstreet boys  Have you had to defend  Like  Now it seems like  All these  Things that you like  All the bands  And the  Action figure collecting  They all kind of  Fit into this persona  That you've created  That everybody loves  Have you been  Having to defend this  Though  Like  Before you created  This persona  Back when like  Nobody knew who you were  And you were still  Doing all this weird stuff 
[03:51:00]  Oh my god  Like in high school  The fact that like  I wanted to be  A WWE superstar  Like people would laugh  At me  They would laugh  In my face  Yeah  You know  And like  It's funny now  Cause like  When I  You know  I moved away  To go to the  WWE developmental school  When I came back  Everyone wanted to be  Buddy buddy with me  And I was like  Are you serious bro  Yeah  Get out of here  Exactly  It's like  I mean  You remember  You're a loyal guy  You remember where people were  You remember  You know  You're not gonna start  Liking O-Town now

[03:57:30]  He's a wrestler  And he sits in his car  Listening to this song  It's awesome  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  I mean I don't know  What more you could want  On this radio show  This has been an amazing  Week since we returned from vacation  On the Opie and Anthony show  And I mean  It gets better and better every day  You know  I'm not even talking about  Just having Zack Ryder  On the after show  But you talk about the main show  You talk about the Opie and Anthony show  Where you had Patton Oswald  Sitting in all day  Nick Swartzen stopping by  Kevin Smith on the phone 
[03:58:00]  And tomorrow  Eric should I tell him?  Tomorrow?  Yeah you might as well  The man himself  Jim Brewer  Returns to the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow  He might have an update  I've spoken to him  Because I did a  Comedy by request  With Jim Brewer yesterday  And he was very excited  About coming back  And I've heard  That he actually cancelled  A couple TV appearances  So that he could come  On to O&A earlier  Take that  PIX11 
[03:58:30]  Okay well I didn't want to  Shout out this station  Eric  I don't think that was  Our place to do it  We're joined though  By an old familiar face  To the Opie and Anthony show  I hope you all know her by now  It's Francine  Francine is back  Hey you guys  How you doing Francine  For those of you that don't remember  I was actually just talking to  Pips the intern  From Ron and Fez  During the commercial break  And Francine is probably  Most famous  For her story  Where she 
[03:59:00]  Had the  Not the abortion  Where she was gonna  Have an abortion  But then she  Miscarried  Into a toilet  And you told that story  With such glee  I was 17  You guys  I didn't want it  And so you were  No you didn't want the baby  You did want the miscarriage  Absolutely  That's disgusting  But it was such  You said it was such  Joy  And  And pizzazz  That I think it gained you  A whole lot of new fans  And you've also  I mean  You had a segment for a while  Where you were coming in  And doing the news  Yes I did 
[03:59:30]  And that was more focused around  Opie and Anthony  Not thinking you were  Super intelligent  Um  I am super intelligent  No I think so  First of all  Thank you  Yeah but Opie and Anthony  Do not  No they think I'm intelligent  Okay  Um  We'll agree to disagree  I saw  You were saying hello  To Opie and Anthony  And Jim  Your old pal  Because you  Were an intern for the show  At one point right  Yes I was  And this was way  Ten years ago  Right way back in the day  In WNEW  That is correct  Before we were even  On satellite radio  That is correct 
[04:00:00]  What was your internship  Like back then  It was actually a lot of fun  I used to listen to  Opie and Anthony  Um  At home with my sister  And my brother  Who were way too young  To be listening  Um  My brother didn't really  Like it so much  But my sister loved it  So it's to the point  Where she's actually  Obsessed with Opie and Anthony  As well  But yeah  So is she jealous  That you're an Opie and Anthony star  She is kind of jealous  But now she's 18  Oh  So she can actually come  And so she's always like  Oh when are you going  I want to come with you  And I never tell her  When I'm coming  What 
[04:00:30]  She's in college  She's in college in Canada  Anyway so  Oh  Yeah  But yeah  We're ONA fans  And  But what was it like  When you were an intern  Because I can relate  I can  I mean I was an intern  But this was during  Satellite radio days  What was it like  Interning during the  Terrestrial radio days  It was  It was fun  I mean it's no different  Than what you guys are doing  I mean technology  Was like a little different  So we had like faxes  Instead of uh  I guess comments  Written down on a computer screen  Gotcha  So we used to take faxes  In and out of the room  Um back in those days  It was really raunchy 
[04:01:00]  So I used to see  Lesbian sex going on  That was  That's nice  No that's not always nice  Um  I think I saw live sex  Lots of girls  Intercourse  Yeah intercourse  That's not allowed here  Uh yeah  Um also  That would  That would uh  Make penetration  So that's  No we're not allowed  To do that  Lots of girls  Used to come in  To do the wow photos  That was interesting  So I saw  I saw lots of boobs  And I think I was working  At Victoria's Secrets  At the time  So I had to see boobs  At work  Secrets  And then  Boobs at 
[04:01:30]  My internship  So it was just  So that must have been  A great time in your life  Um  Not really  No  Well okay  Well the Victoria's Secrets  Wasn't fun  You know everybody here  Of course  You know me  And E-Rock  Danny  Derek  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  But I was noticing  While the show was going on  Because you were here  While the show was on  Um  It was a very exciting show  Today by the way  Wasn't it  Uh yes  It was very exciting  But mostly we were talking  About the bible back there  And me loving money  Well yeah I mean  You met Troy today  Yeah Troy  Where's Troy 
[04:02:00]  He should come down here  Troy was an interesting character  Well Troy uh  He didn't really like  Your attitude it seemed like  Yeah but  Because you came in  And you were saying  That you sleep with men  Because they have money  Totally not true  I did not say that  What did you say  I don't remember  But I didn't  It was something to that effect  Probably  Okay  She did say she  Oh sorry  Go ahead  She admitted she was a gold digger  She did  Yeah  Okay  As a joke  That was a joke  Kind of  Sort of 
[04:02:30]  Yes  And then uh  And then you started  Doing your flirty thing  With Troy  That you do with guys  Where it's like  You start kind of  Talking real close to them  And sitting on the arm  Of the chair  They're sitting on  Uh knowing  That you're just  Well you're being a  I'll say it  A C tease  Because I don't want to  Be vulgar  Around a lady  Be vulgar  Cock tease  That's right  Is what you're doing  You're uh  You're just teasing them  As if to say  There's a possibility  Of sexual activity  When there isn't  I guess so 
[04:03:00]  Yeah  That is what you were doing  I guess  Troy responded though  He was being uh  A little rude to you  Yeah he was being  Kind of gay  About it  Wow  Yeah  Troy was being gay  In what way  Troy was being a big  Cocksucker about it  You think so  A big pillow biter  About it  Pillow biter  A little turd burglar  About it  Wow  And in what way  You think  I don't know  I feel like  Okay most guys  I do that with  First of all  I'd never do that  Professionally at work  Okay  I don't know  What his problem was  I'm like  We're on the  Opie and Anthony show  It's a pretty 
[04:03:30]  Free spirited  Kind of air here  Nobody's gonna  Take that as any way  And he goes and  Takes it to like  The next level of  He starts getting  All harsh and stupid  And just like  But do you think  I mean but you say  You think Troy is  Like he wasn't  Responding to your  Advances because  He's attracted to men  Did you get that  Vibe sort of  I don't know  If he's attracted to men  But I'm like  Most guys don't  Really respond to this  This way  They don't  Respond to it  With like  Anger  Anger and animosity  I'm like most guys  Like it when I do this  So you're saying 
[04:04:00]  Like he might not  Be gay  But he's probably  At least like  Somewhat bisexual  Yeah  You do think so  I think so  And he's a fashionable  Guy so kind of  Well I mean  Don't laugh at what  I'm saying  This is you  You know  Yeah I guess  He is slightly  Fashionable  So uh  Where was it  Left  I mean I don't  Know where he is  Now maybe he's  Afraid of you  Yeah maybe he's  Having sex in the  Bathroom  Maybe he's putting  His leg out  Under that bathroom  Stall  And trying to get  Some ass  Well if he were  Having sex in the  Bathroom  Only men are allowed  In that bathroom 
[04:04:30]  Ah duh  So you're saying  He may be having  Sex with a male  Coworker in the  Bathroom  Yeah  That's where you'd  Assume Troy is  Yeah cause he  Doesn't like me  Eric where is Troy  I looked all over  The place  I can't find him  Did you check for  A bathroom stall  With four feet  Under the door  No there's a line  There's a line  Yeah  Maybe everybody  Found out that Troy  Was in there  Pleasing men  According to Francine  I mean I guess  This is just an  Assumption but this  Is kind of what  You gathered from  The conversation  I gathered that  He just was  Not very nice to  Me in general  I was just like  This is really weird  I'm not used to 
[04:05:00]  People being mean to  Me  In sort of  Like  Especially guys  Cause and he  Came off as like  A sort of  I'm into guys  Yeah rub my ass  All over him  And then he's  Getting all stupid  I'm just like  What's wrong with you  I'm being very nice  I'm like you  Touch my ass  You let him  Touch your ass  With his hand  What  Well his elbow  Whatever  With his hand  What did you think  I didn't mean  With his penis  No not his hand  His elbow  You just said  With his hand  I rubbed my butt  On his elbow  Would you have  Let him touch  Your ass  With his hand  No  Cause we're not  That good of friends  Oh  That's only for  Your very good 
[04:05:30]  Like what about  Like  Like  E-Rock  I think E-Rock  Has touched my butt  Before  Not since he's  Been married though  No  Okay  Troy has about  One minute  And it does look  Like he's walking  Bow-legged  So you might have  Been right  Francine was just  Telling me that  She assumes  Based on how you  Reacted to her  That you are  Maybe not gay  But at least  Somewhat bisexual  And just now  You were  Having intercourse  With male co-workers  In the bathroom  Right 
[04:06:00]  That male co-worker  Must have been  Gary Schoenwood  Our boss  I don't know  I don't know who it is  But if you're gonna  Make accusations  About you know  I just don't know  She's just so used  To guys kissing her ass  That I just don't  Even  So not true  I don't think  She just walks in  She walks into a place  So not true  She walked into the  Back room  And she's like  Oh I need this  And do you have  This for me  And blah blah blah  Like give me gifts  Because I'm pretty  And I just looked at her  You didn't like that  That's your vibe  Francine  That is not my vibe  You guys  And you know that  Well Troy  You're used to 
[04:06:30]  Getting what you want  And you love the attention  And you love  You love  When guys kiss your ass  She walks back there  And she's like  You said it  Every guy I meet  Wants to fuck me  She said that  And I looked at her  I'm like really  Like you're that  Fucking sure of yourself  Do you want to fuck her  I mean I would use her whole  Do you know what I mean  But that's not saying anything  Back to the orifice thing  Yeah that's not  Like I fuck  Plastic toys  You do  Yes  Okay  And that's really sad  Well I don't give a fuck
