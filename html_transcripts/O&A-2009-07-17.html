<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts' typical cynical yet energetic opening, lamenting their fatigue but committing to the broadcast. Opie recounted disastrous golf outings, including a particularly bad shot and an encounter with a raccoon that pilfered a fellow golfer's bag after Opie tossed it his lunch (packed by Voss, who was sporting flamboyant golf attire reminiscent of John Daly).  This led to a discussion of Holly Madison's post-Hefner appearance and the physical transformations some Playboy Playmates undergo, as well as a joke about Alicia Barton's 5150 hold. A caller, Eric, praised Opie's past jokes, specifically one about Siamese twins and jail.  The discussion then moved to the slow cleanup of Bethpage State Park post-U.S. Open, followed by Opie's experience at a Manhattan car club event featuring exotic cars, including a street-legal Aerial Atom, and Tracy Morgan's membership. They discussed electric cars (Teslas) and a new game called "Bags."

The show then transitioned to a series of news stories:  NASA allegedly admitting the moon landing was faked, a death at a Madonna concert due to a stage collapse, and a murder on a Carnival cruise ship.  The hosts launched into a comedic bit about the cruise ship murder, speculating on the killer's methods and the difficulties of disposing of a body at sea, with a fictionalized account from the victim's perspective.  A caller, Stryker, pointed out the extensive security camera coverage on modern cruise ships, highlighting the killer's blunders.

A later segment began with a brief discussion on the dangers of advanced robotics. This segued into the New York Post article about the murder of a Long Island motivational speaker found strangled and stabbed in his car after a 3 a.m. trip to buy condoms in East Harlem.  The hosts speculated on his possible encounter with a prostitute in the Wagner Houses, using Google Street View to illustrate the area's perceived danger. The conversation shifted to their interview with Ian Halperin, followed by a lengthy, crude, and sexually suggestive running joke about Sam Roberts' long hair,  including speculation about his potential participation in a furry convention, focusing on costume choices and sexual habits of furry convention attendees.  They repeatedly mocked Sam's pronunciation of certain words.  Joe DeRosa was mentioned as an upcoming guest, along with Bobo and the hosts' attempts to "steal Bobo's chick."

Another segment started with a discussion about a host's bright yellow shirt and men's fashion trends, briefly consulting Chris from Bopperston.  The conversation veered back to furry conventions ("Fur Fright"), jokes about one host's girlfriend Jess (whose name has similar masculine connotations), and a series of on-air spats and playful banter between the hosts, especially targeting Sam, who hinted at quitting. This segment included homophobic slurs, sexually explicit comments, discussions about bodily functions, and wrestling, focusing on a picture interpreted as depicting a sexual act between wrestlers. Listener calls contributed to the sexually explicit and offensive themes. CokeLogic discussed his animations and Chicago sports teams. Another caller's girlfriend disliked Sam's presence, fueling more sexually charged exchanges.  The hosts frequently used homophobic slurs toward Sam, discussed pornographic films and their titles ("Lick My Balls," "There's a Negro in My Mom"), a Major League Baseball player's arrest, and a pre-recorded bit of a comedian heckling a performance. The segment concluded with a pre-recorded bit involving a pie, hair, and Cool Whip.  Bobo was mentioned staring at a picture of himself.


Comedian Joe DeRosa was a guest, recounting an angry confrontation with a heckler during a stand-up performance using highly offensive language. He then discussed a short-lived relationship that ended after a meltdown at a Shoe Mania sale. The conversation shifted to "Bobo," focusing on a Sirius XM employee's pursuit of a coworker, Christina, who was uninterested.  The hosts detailed their prank calls to Bobo, playing voicemails and escalating pranks. They discussed Bobo’s attempts to win Christina over, including growing a mustache.  They detailed Bobo's bizarre first-date plans: an oversized burger, beer, and the Queens Motor Inn.  Highly offensive language and sexually explicit discussions were frequent.


The final segment centered on Bobo's date with Christina, revealing he’d already told her he loved her and that Christina followed Howard Stern on Twitter. This led to jokes about Bobo sending Stern pictures of his genitals and a discussion of Bobo's pubic hair and hypospadias, involving numerous surgeries on his penis. The hosts and Dr. Steve (a caller) discussed his condition, culminating in a segment where Iraq smelled Bobo’s genitals. Louis C.K. called in, commenting on the situation and mentioning his Emmy nomination.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Bobo’s dating prospects, grooming advice, a plug for Joe DeRosa's performances, plans for Bobo’s future guest appearance, and a mention of a party at Anthony's house. The segment was filled with crude jokes and sexually explicit discussions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Alright.  Well.  Yay, we get to do it again!  Yay!  Hooray, everybody!  Yay, we get to do it again!  Another day!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay! 
[00:00:30]  Yay!  Yay!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Yay!  Well, that was a fast week.  It's already Friday.  Wow, that didn't drag at all.  Jesus.  Did it drag for you?  Actually, they all do.  Please.  It's just frustrating.  We had a killer show yesterday, and now we have to do it again.  Do it again!  Do it again!  And most of you assholes don't even remember that we had a good show yesterday.  That's what sucks about this whole thing. 
[00:01:00]  No.  I wasn't here.  Don't care.  Heard one break.  If we suck dick today, you guys would go, well, those guys suck dick.  And they won't even give us credit for yesterday's brilliance.  No, there's no carryover minutes in radio.  Ah!  Ah!  But we are the workhorses.  We are here.  We are live.  Nice.  Bringing you horse shit.  What is this crap?  I want to say hi to the guy.  I forgot to tell you this one.  And I have been chit-chatting. 
[00:01:30]  I played Beth Page yesterday.  A little golf action.  Golf?  This is the summer of golf for me.  I haven't played in years.  Yeah, apparently so.  And this year, this summer, I've decided I'm going to play a lot of golf.  I'm up to, like, seven rounds, which is crazy for me.  Wow.  Who's that?  Is that that chick from, um...  Yeah.  Wow.  Holly Madison?  Yeah, she's from Girls Next Door.  She looks great in that picture.  She never looked that good on the show.  No.  Where's that?  That's the superficial.  The superficial?  Yeah, it's the superficial. 
[00:02:00]  But that looks like a TMZ-type website.  Yeah, it's kind of...  They're all starting to look the same.  Yeah, you know, the celebrity blog style site.  You see her during the UFC?  Doing the little card thing?  Oh, was she doing the card thing?  Wow, she looks really good.  Yeah, they fixed her up or something.  Well...  I think Hugh Hefner sucks the life force out of them.  Until they get away from him.  Dude, I was discussing this the other day.  Hugh Hefner makes every one of his girls bleach blonde, like that horrible, over-the-top blonde hair. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Huge boob, you know, breast implants.  Fake tits.  You know, and then when these girls leave, you know, his compound or whatever...  His domain.  Then they kind of go a little more natural and they look way hotter.  Way hotter.  Who's that pig?  Alicia Barton.  Oh, my God, what happened to her?  She used to be hot, right?  They just locked her up on a 5150.  Oh, really?  Oh, she's nuts? 
[00:03:00]  Really?  Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!  Nice.  That instantly means obtainable, by the way.  Yeah, crazy girl's rule.  Which is kind of cool.  Crazy girl's rule.  What was she from?  I forgot that...  What the hell was she in?  Travis has the OC.  Oh, yeah.  The OC!  And what'd she do?  Did they say what she did?  Was she running around naked?  Please say yes.  Please say yes.  Running around naked, crazy girl.  Crazy girl running around naked.  She called police to assist with a medical issue and removed her from the home. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, I thought you were going to say removed her clothes.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Let me see if there's any more on it.  Oh, just naked.  Just find an article where they say she was naked and crazy.  Naked, running around, crazy.  Why is it always someone like that fucking stupid Superman woman?  That disgusting fucking Margot Kidder that rips her clothes off and hides under the neighbor's  porch like a squirrel.  Yeah, we didn't want to see you naked.  No!  We want to see the hot girls naked.  Yes! 
[00:04:00]  Why is this guy saying this?  Eric in Jersey.  What?  Eric.  Fellas, I'm big, I'm relatively a new listener, and Opie, I was trying to figure you out,  and then the cancer thing came up, and I kind of get it.  You seem like you're back on your game, and I love it.  You had me at one line, and I repeat, it was a classic.  Had me at hello.  And you never get ready for this stuff.  You were talking about Siamese twins, and what do they do if one of them gets in trouble,  and they go to jail, it wouldn't be fair to the other.  Or, and Opie came out with, maybe he doesn't live the rest of his life with a birdcage 
[00:04:30]  on his head.  I forgot about that.  Thank you, Eric.  I appreciate it.  Follow me on Twitter, Opie Radio.  I got one-liners all day long for everybody.  Thanks, Eric.  She looked good in that picture, by the way.  No, I'm happy, because I ended up talking to some dumb therapist and figured some shit  out.  But now I say, go fuck yourself to the therapist, and I say, fuck you, Eric.  Have a nice day.  I don't want to.  What do you got?  What are you looking at?  She looks hot in some of the pictures, and other ones, she looks terrible. 
[00:05:00]  She used to be really, really sexy.  So listen, so I was at Bethpage State Park playing a little golf, which is, who gives a shit?  We're not going to do a huge break on golf, obviously.  But I'm in a sand trap, I think it was, and I had a horrendous shot that almost took this  guy out.  And you know how now you have to awkwardly walk toward the tee of the next hole while  the guys are sitting there?  Yeah, I kind of had a bad shot.  I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry.  And the whole freaking foursome recognized me. 
[00:05:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  So then I made it perfectly clear every time I did have an okay shot to point it out to  these assholes.  See that one?  See that one?  That was a good one.  That one almost didn't hit you.  Oh, I mean, this was a shank that almost took this guy out.  And then he goes, oh, big fan, big fan.  Where's Anthony?  It's always, where's Anthony?  I don't know where he is.  He's caddying for me.  He'll be up in a minute.  He's getting my club.  People think we just hang out 24 hours a day.  See, Anthony.  As soon as 11 o'clock hits, we're out. 
[00:06:00]  We run away from each other.  We go.  We run away.  We can't run fast enough.  No.  No, we can just cut things.  But things like, yeah, you were golfing with Voss yesterday.  Well, did you see the picture of the raccoon?  Yeah, that thing is giant.  And I tweeted a picture of the raccoon.  What was it?  It was a hot day yesterday.  It was, what, 85, 90 in the city area?  Let's call it 85, sunny.  It was brutal out there.  All of a sudden, there's a raccoon in the garbage.  And I'm thinking to myself, this can't be good because you always hear the story. 
[00:06:30]  If you see a raccoon during the day, it's rabid.  Stay away.  In the heat and walking around.  What if the raccoon just wants to kind of wander around a little bit?  It's like waking up at night for a snack.  Well, we do that, right?  Are we rabid?  No.  If you wake up in the middle of the night, take a leak, and go get some orange juice from the refrigerator, are you rabid?  No.  But I think it was.  Wow, that guy is big, though.  Yeah, I got it on Twitter.  Opie Radio again.  I'm just going to Opie Radio my ass off today. 
[00:07:00]  No.  And then it climbed up into a tree.  And then it started just walking toward us.  I probably knew you had grub or something.  And then there was another foursome that was backed up.  We were on the tee.  And then another foursome came upon us.  And the guy's sitting there on his cell phone.  And all of a sudden, this raccoon, while he's still in the golf cart, went to the back of the golf cart and started going through the guy's golf bag for food.  Could you imagine if you didn't know there was a raccoon there?  And all of a sudden, you get out of the golf cart and you go walk to the back to get your driver.  And there's a raccoon. 
[00:07:30]  You freak out.  Wouldn't you freak out?  Yes.  And then stupid me.  I like that.  I pulled out my HD flip.  I'm like, you know what?  I think I can make some kind of video with the raccoon.  And I started getting closer and closer.  And then the thing basically showed its teeth and gave me a look.  No way, yeah.  It was kind of up in a tree.  And then someone said, you know what?  I think the raccoon could jump from there and probably land on you.  How scary would that be?  Like, it pulls that alien move on you and just goes, wraps around your face.  Right, right.  And then at that point, I'm like, you know what? 
[00:08:00]  Maybe I should just leave the raccoon alone.  Yeah, I think I'll leave him alone.  But when you see a raccoon, the only thing I can think of is the South Park episode with Carmen.  What was his name?  The Coon.  The Coon.  The Coon.  The Coon.  The Coon.  So, I don't know.  Is it Rabbit or what?  I would say probably not.  Probably not?  Yeah, it was probably just one that knew it could get food from people that were golfing.  Did you see Voss's golf pants?  No, I didn't look at Voss's pictures. 
[00:08:30]  No, no, there's one on mine.  He's got the most obnoxious golf pants ever.  It wasn't those, like, pink, like, pastel-ish.  Oh, yeah, well, it was a version of that.  Those are court jester pants.  He's wearing court jester pants.  He was so happy.  I don't know what happens with Voss.  What does he think?  That's good?  I mean, we're friends outside the show.  I think people sort of know that. 
[00:09:00]  I mean, we have an interest in golf, so we get together and play golf every once in a while.  I guess that's as far as our friendship really goes.  But when I show up to play golf with Voss, I almost feel like I'm a chick to him or something.  Like, all of a sudden, he comes walking up with those pants, all excited to see me.  Like, I'm going to be like, wow, look at you.  You look good.  Voss, where'd you get the shirt and the pants?  Look at that glove.  And then once again, he packed lunch for me.  It's like, it's this whole awkward thing. 
[00:09:30]  He packed lunch again.  He gets so excited to play golf with me.  Me.  Stupid me.  Because nobody plays with me.  I think that's what it is.  Because most times when he calls me around the country, he's playing golf by himself.  So maybe you're right.  It's like he's excited to finally play with someone he knows.  Somebody he knows.  But then it's just awkward.  Because then I'm starving because I came from the show.  You know how that goes.  And all of a sudden, I know he packed the lunch.  But I don't want to be like, I don't want his stupid lunch.  Eat it.  You know, his fingers have been on that bologna. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  But I was starving.  So then I'm like, oh, you got my lunch that you packed for me.  That sandwich.  And then I took a few bites and I threw it at the raccoon.  So the raccoon ate Voss' lunch for me.  He must have a whole collection of golf pants that, you know something, if you, on the golf course, he looks ridiculous.  I just got to say, it looks crazy.  But if you wore those, like, out anywhere else but a golf course, you'd be committed. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Of course you would.  He looks like a nut.  Yeah.  It's a new trend.  I think John Daly had very similar pants at the British Open yesterday.  With whiskey flask in the back pocket.  I don't know what's going on with Daly because he looks a lot thinner.  Does he?  I'm wondering if he either got his stomach stapled or got some real help finally.  Yeah, got some help.  Because he looked way better.  And he's wearing, like, the Voss pants.  It's that website that Voss was promoting.  I don't even remember him.  We don't need to do that here.  Littlefingers.com? 
[00:11:00]  The other thing about Beth Page, the U.S. Open was, what, three weeks ago?  Three and a half weeks ago?  Yeah.  They're still – is that a picture from the British Open yesterday?  I don't know where it's from.  I think it might be because that looks very – yeah, I think that's him.  Holy shit.  And they're Voss's pants in just a different color scheme.  Yeah, yeah, different color, but those triangles or diamond shapes or whatever the fuck.  You know that they're still breaking down the U.S. Open at Beth Page?  Oh, really?  Like cleaning it up and – 
[00:11:30]  It's still a major construction zone from the U.S. Open, which was, what, three and a half weeks ago, I think?  Pretty slow over there.  Dude, there are hundreds of workers trying to take down those corporate tents.  I guess when they started with the dumb corporate tents, it was like – it was a big just tent on the grass like you would almost put in your backyard for a party.  Now they're very detailed platforms with the – what is it called?  The fucking metal braces and stuff. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And it's way up off the ground.  It's major construction.  Some of those have got chandeliers inside them.  These things are – yeah.  Yeah.  They had electricity, full bathrooms, like chandeliers, all that.  Yeah.  It's major construction.  And the point I want to make is the U.S. Open was only there for a week for this major construction that they're still trying to break down.  How do they get money for that?  Huh?  What is it?  Just ticket sales to, like, get money for the workers that put that up and take it down?  I think it's the corporate sponsors buy those tents, and they're not cheap. 
[00:12:30]  Because I was thinking that yesterday.  I'm like, these workers have got to be making a bloody fortune.  Yeah.  So – but that was my afternoon, and then you did something completely different.  Yes, I had a car club event.  A little car club in Manhattan there.  Yeah, my car had its little debutante ball.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I took it down there, and it was just in the middle of the floor with a bunch of other, like, exotic cars and everything with the hood up. 
[00:13:00]  And people are just kind of, you know, walking around, taking pictures of it.  Ooh.  I always find that weird.  You see those car outings on Long Island, the exact same thing?  Yeah.  And I could go, wow, that's a cool car.  Yeah.  I'm at least that much in, right?  But then when you see the hood's up and these guys walking around and they got their hand on their chin and they're looking under the hood, that's where you completely lose me.  What are they looking at?  Like, oh, wow, is that a radiator cap?  But what are they looking at? 
[00:13:30]  Do you know?  I don't know.  You really don't know either?  They're just looking – I don't know.  They're just looking at stuff.  But they're impressed with what's under the hood.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a real gearhead.  The good thing about this, the car club, is they have a bunch of exotic cars.  And it's not just like, you know, kind of any car you'd see any day, stuff like that.  I mean, Ferraris and Ford GTs.  They had a car – I don't even know what the hell this is.  It looked like a rail.  It's just like welded pipes with an engine in it. 
[00:14:00]  The thing weighs like, I don't know, 200 pounds and has umpteen horse.  Really?  And apparently it's street legal.  And I don't know how, but it's really fast.  And then we tried to take a drive out on the streets yesterday with one of the cars, and it's Manhattan.  So it's just – you can't even go – you can't go faster than like 30 miles an hour.  Where do you guys go to take a ride in Manhattan?  That's just it.  Like the West Side Highway.  Oh, you try to get up that way or something? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, but then it's like –  Yeah, there it is.  Look at that thing.  It's street legal.  That's street legal?  Get the fuck out of here.  Yep.  It looks kind of like a –  It's like a Formula One racer.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, without the shell on it.  It's ridiculous.  What is it called?  Aerial Atom.  The Aerial Atom.  Yeah.  How fast could that go?  I'm not even sure.  It says here it weighs 1,400 pounds and it goes 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds. 
[00:15:00]  2.8 seconds to go 60 miles an hour.  And it's only 1,400 pounds?  Yeah.  It's just – there's nothing to it.  Holy shit.  And then they have the Tesla, the electric car, which is insane.  You hate electric cars.  Yeah.  This thing is fucked up though.  Unbelievable.  They're starting to figure it out and make them look cool?  This thing is so fast.  And it's like you just sit there and the guy at the car club is like, you check this out.  It's off, right?  He goes, click.  Now it's on. 
[00:15:30]  And then he steps on the gas.  There's one gear.  You just put it in drive.  Yeah.  And then he steps on the gas a little bit and all you hear is the crunching of the tires on the floor like that.  And you can just take off in this thing and it's fast as fuck.  Wow.  Unbelievably fast.  And it looks cool?  Yeah.  It looks really cool.  It's real small, light, carbon fiber.  Would you ever get an electric car?  That one I would.  You would?  Could do about 200 miles before it needs a recharge. 
[00:16:00]  So it's a little inconvenient.  You can't just pull up to a gas station.  Yeah, but it's one of those cars you just kind of drive in the neighborhood or whatever.  Yeah, you wouldn't.  It would be you're driving out to mommy's car.  Yeah, you wouldn't commute with it or anything like that.  Pretty insane.  You could, though.  You could.  Just plug it in every night.  You could, but it's such a.  That's what it looks like?  Yeah, I don't think that's the right one.  But that car is not that bad.  It's almost like a convertible and it was black carbon fiber.  Did you guys take that out on the road?  Nah, just kind of drove it back and forth in the showroom a little bit. 
[00:16:30]  What, like two feet?  Yeah, it's like two feet.  They were just trying to show me how it doesn't make any noise.  It's like the sickest thing.  And then there's some cars.  Yeah, there it is.  That's really sick.  That's an electric car?  Yeah.  And it just flies.  I want to try to explain it to the audience, but it's.  It's a little like a Ferrari.  Sort of, yeah, with a convertible.  Yeah, convertible top, two-seater.  Yep.  And just really goes.  Wow, that's cool.  That's some really cool cars down there, man. 
[00:17:00]  Just like a Prius, right?  Yeah, exactly like a Prius.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  But it's cool just hanging out down there.  What do you guys do there?  Oh, there's a whole, a full bar.  So you just like hang out, drink, talk about your car adventures.  Tracy Morgan is a member.  So.  Was he there?  No, but they play this video that keeps, you know, repeating over and over.  And it's just Tracy, like, and a bunch of other people that belong to the club talking  about, like, yeah, I take these cars out. 
[00:17:30]  I put two fingers in a girl in the backseat of that car.  Like, he's always just putting.  He's got to just.  I know.  He's always just putting fingers in a girl somewhere.  Two fingers in a girl.  No matter what the situation.  In the back of your car.  And they were just laughing at if he wrecked the car, how he'd be just like, your car drove  into that other car.  It wasn't me.  Your car drove into that car.  Oh, he's a funny motherfucker, man.  I love that guy.  Yeah.  That's it right there.  So what?  You guys just drink and talk about cars? 
[00:18:00]  Like, is there like a, I don't know, pool table or.  No, not there.  Just.  That's pretty much.  Yeah.  You put your motorhead.  But then there's like hot chicks that are walking around, too.  And are they hookers?  No, no.  Not hookers.  Is that bad to even ask?  Hot chicks.  No.  But why would hot chicks be there?  Because it almost sounds like it's a, it's a, it's a men's club.  Well, I think.  Women, you're not allowed.  I think because a lot of the guys there are well-to-do.  So the girls are there, you know, either with the well-to-do guys or maybe looking for 
[00:18:30]  the well-to-do guys.  Oh, finding a well-to-do.  Guys.  For a price, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's, you know.  It's, well, maybe for, the free booze helps, too.  All right.  Ixnay on the hookers.  No, no.  They're not.  They weren't hookers.  They really weren't hookers.  Look at me blowing up your spot.  Wow.  Hookers and drugs at the car club in Manhattan.  It was Manhattan Club Cars.  Club Cars.  And it's a.  No, they're a good organization.  Have a lot of fun with that.  It's just cool that every so often you're like, oh, you know what? 
[00:19:00]  I want to drive a Ferrari for the weekend.  You know?  And you just drive a Ferrari or Lamborghini or Aston Martin.  You know?  It's pretty cool.  And then last night, like I said, my car, they just asked me to bring it down and feature it.  So they send out, like, an email to everybody that it's, you know, a big happy hour Thursday thing.  Right.  It's going to be a Shelby Super Snake featured for the evening.  Right.  And there's my car in the middle of the floor.  That's pretty neat.  People walking up. 
[00:19:30]  Ooh, this is nice.  Is this yours?  Were you, like, a proud popper?  I was.  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah.  That's me.  And then they ask me all kinds of questions I don't know.  Like, oh, how many horses is it?  Well, all right.  I had 720 horsepower and, you know, what went into it with the Super Snake.  But then some people are like, you know, what's the fucking ham-a-namba-sham-a-namba?  I'm like, ah, let me think.  That slipped my mind.  I don't know what the fucking exact diameter of the fucking drive shaft is.  You just watch your brain short circuit.  Yeah.  And then, of course, the smart-ass douchebags that are our fans, I Twitter a picture of 
[00:20:00]  the car on the floor there.  Oh, that's your car?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  And they Twitter.  They shined it up nice.  Shined it up real nice.  And they just Twitter stuff like, you know, oh, wow, did you detail the hanger, too?  That's holding up the exhaust.  And it was all about the hanger.  Everybody was just talking about the hanger.  Fucking assholes.  Yeah, that's why we love them. 
[00:20:30]  The hanger there.  As long as we know you're on our side, who gives a shit.  And some people say, you know, you should have cleaned it up more.  It's still a little dirty.  It's like, you know, it's pretty shiny.  And it kind of was drizzling yesterday a little.  It doesn't look dirty at all.  It looks nice.  It looks brand fucking new.  Leave it alone.  Okay.  Yeah, so that was just awesome.  So they have, like, a lounge.  You said a full bar, but is it, like, a lounging bar?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, they got an area where there's couches and stuff.  And there's an Xbox. 
[00:21:00]  You could just jump on the Xbox.  Nice.  And they have the driving games with a couple of the steering wheels hooked up to a desk  in front of this big screen.  So you could go head-to-head with the driving games and shit.  And it's just.  Yeah, but do they have bags?  Bags?  Yeah.  My new favorite fucking bar game.  You played Bags, Danny?  Bags?  Golden Tee Bags.  Tee Bags?  What?  Golden Tee Bags.  Golden Tee was the golf game with the big ball. 
[00:21:30]  And you go.  Oh, right.  I remember that game.  But now Golden Tee's being.  They're getting smart.  And they're making other games with that, you know, that.  With the roller?  With the roller.  And they got one called Bags.  And I'm hooked on it.  It's the dumbest, simplest game.  What is it?  It's the beach game where you get a couple bean bags and you throw it into, you know,  there's a board with a hole in it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I think the actual name is Cornhole, believe it or not.  Cornhole.  Yeah.  Yes.  See, Golden Tee's version is just, they call it Bags.  There was.  But you got to play the wind and everything. 
[00:22:00]  I was thinking that you should get this for your compound.  I saw that.  It's a pizza party.  What?  And Sal was playing.  Sal was very good at it.  Oh, really?  The real game, not the computer game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's a great beach game, but then they figured out how to make it work.  Look, Ro!  They made it work as far as a video game goes.  It's so simple.  But then you have to play the wind and shit.  Really?  You got three shot options.  I was thinking Ann should get this for his compound. 
[00:22:30]  Nice little.  Especially if Sal likes it.  Yeah.  You have plenty of room down there.  I mean, I saw the asteroid machine, but I mean, I did.  Oh, yeah.  That's the video version?  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  How do they make that into a video game?  It works, though.  I'm telling you.  Look at the aim, the wind.  And you really need to have a touch.  That's pretty good.  On the rollerball thingy.  I like video game versions of some real games where you don't have to then go and pick up  the shit.  Right.  It's always fun. 
[00:23:00]  How much is that?  Get one of those for Ann.  Jesus Christ.  Get one for Ann.  I'm telling you.  Just lag it in.  It's a simple game that you would enjoy at the compound.  Oh, by the way.  Download the ROM.  Yeah.  Just load the ROM.  Use it in one of the games.  I hate to do this to you, but now you've got to pay me because I just consulted.  Consulted for the compound consultation.  Yeah.  I just did a little work for you there.  Ange probably wouldn't like that.  Why?  In the basement area.  I don't know. 
[00:23:30]  She doesn't like any of the games.  I know.  And you're saying, why should that matter?  But I don't know.  You bring up a really good point.  Because I also had someone design or redesign, whatever the fuck you call it, my place.  And then you have those people over that redesigned your place.  And they're mad with what you did with your place.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, you shouldn't have put that in there.  Oh, what's that doing here?  They feel like it's their home now.  Sorry.  I guess I'll have it taken out immediately. 
[00:24:00]  Really?  And then you feel, oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  But I kind of like this.  They hate some of my pictures and stuff.  And I'm like, well, they're my pictures.  It doesn't really go well.  You know something?  Right.  I like it there.  Exactly.  At least I didn't listen to them when they wanted to get me the uncomfortable furniture  because I guess it looks cooler.  Oh, yeah.  There's comfy furniture or uncomfortable.  Like, you can't sit in it, but it looks great furniture.  We went shopping with the designer.  And they're like, oh, that would be.  And they use the word fabulous a lot. 
[00:24:30]  Fabulous.  That would be fabulous.  Ah.  And you look at this thing, and you'd have to have some kind of spinal cord injury to  enjoy this piece of furniture.  You have to be paralyzed so you don't feel it.  Right.  And they openly admit it's a very uncomfortable piece.  They call them all pieces.  Everything's a piece.  It's a very uncomfortable piece, but it would look fabulous in your place.  Fabulous.  I'm like, no one's really going to be sitting.  I don't give a shit about what it.  I want comfort.  Big, comfy couch.  That's the only thing I care about is comfort. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Not something that's going to look fabulous that no one wants to sit in or will attempt  to sit in.  What's the point?  What's the point of that?  Let's go to Jason in Tennessee.  Jason.  Good evening.  Hey.  Good evening.  How you doing, boys?  Doing good, man.  Good deal.  Ant, I picked up my new toy last weekend.  Oh.  The new ZR1.  Yeah.  What's that? 
[00:25:30]  Those are fast.  It's already in the shop.  Yeah.  Oh, it is?  What happened?  I just had it repainted.  I just, I bought it, and the plans on paint it anyway.  I'm having it, it's been planted as we speak, getting ready to be sprayed flat, flat, and  I'm putting flat, black wheels on it.  Yeah, those things are monsters, man.  And I got a Viper, too.  A Viper, also?  A Viper, also?  What do you do?  What are you, a car thief?  He sells crystal meth.  No, I'm a land developer. 
[00:26:00]  A what?  It's already there.  Land developer.  It doesn't have to be developed.  It's there.  I know.  I developed land.  Here it is.  I take a pile of dirt, and I move it over there.  Yeah, there you go.  Developed.  Viper is a, it's twin turbos.  Yeah, Vipers are sick.  Really sick cars.  I sent it to a place in Florida, and they put twin turbos on it, and it's putting about  1,200 to the ground at the rear tires.  God damn, that's insanity.  Wow, awesome.  Fun.  My next purchase is the Super Snake. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I want the main, all three, you know, American muscle cars.  Yeah, the big three.  Is that something that people want to collect, the big three?  Yeah, that's, that's, you need to be a land developer, though, apparently.  Yeah, no kidding.  To have that.  Did you send your Super Snake to Vegas, or did you have one of their authorized people  do it?  Well, no, I sent it out to Vegas.  You did?  Yeah, I wasn't going to have somebody else do it.  See, well, they, from all the information I'm getting, they say that there's authorized 
[00:27:00]  places around the country that will do it.  Yeah, there's a couple of places, like, a little closer, but.  I'd rather go straight to headquarters.  Yeah, I'd rather go there, even though they fucking didn't tighten up one of the exhaust  fucking flanges, but, you know, what are you going to do?  You really think they fucked that up?  I think they fucked that up.  I think some idiot didn't tighten up the fucking bolt on the flange.  At the main facility.  Because now it's fixed, and it's fine.  Yeah.  I'll see you, boys.  All right, take it easy, man.  Land developer.  And that's all they had to do, was tighten that up. 
[00:27:30]  Okay.  So now it's dandy.  But, yeah, somebody just fucked up.  Ugh.  Annois me.  You know how I said, I don't understand the whole looking under the hood thing?  Yeah.  Openly admitting that, okay?  Sonny Ferrelli, he writes, looking under the hood for some people is like hitting a fucking  ball just to go retrieve it.  All right.  All right.  Good point.  Good point.  What happened in the world?  I was too busy golfing.  You were too busy doing the car thing. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, NASA admitted that the Apollo 11 moon landing was fake yesterday.  Yeah.  Could you fucking believe that?  They finally admitted that that whole thing was fake.  I always thought.  And that's why they never went back.  Always thought we went.  I would have been the, you know, I was always the one that would argue the point that they  did go.  And then we find out yesterday, oh, never went.  Amazing.  It was faked.  Yep.  Pissed me off.  Well, because a story came out that they accidentally erased all the original footage of the Apollo 
[00:28:30]  11 moon landing.  Yeah.  Oops.  That wasn't an accident.  Oops.  Had to get rid of the evidence.  Yeah.  So it turns out the whole thing was a sham on the American people and the world.  And the world is right, Anthony.  What else is going on?  What else?  What else is going on?  Just brush over that story.  How do you brush over that?  What else do you want, man? 
[00:29:00]  It was all fake.  We all knew it.  That's it.  That's conspiracy theorists.  We all knew.  It's about time NASA came out and said it.  You know, you usually don't get a government agency really coming forward and spilling beans  like that.  Well, what the fuck do you want from us?  We're not CNN.  We're giving you the fucking headline.  You go find details on it.  If you wanted to elaborate it upon a bit, go to your news site.  There you go.  Let me say hi to Chris and PA.  Chris. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, just a question for Anthony.  Is he going to be taking his car up to the World Classic in Bathurst in January where the  NFL is sponsoring ice skating?  Yeah, I'm going to Bathurst in Bathurst in.  I was laughing all day thinking about that.  The NFL is playing hockey.  That's great.  That's exactly right.  Such it out, boys.  All right.  Thanks.  And the mayor up there still gets so fucking angry and mad at us.  Yeah.  Like we're picking on him.  Yeah, we're the bad guys.  Yeah, okay. 
[00:30:00]  I'm the bad guy.  Is there any local guys that beat him up over how he talks?  I don't know.  I doubt it.  Is that really a Google trend right now?  What is it?  Number 17 on Google Trends.  Why won't my parakeet eat my diarrhea?  Shut the fuck up.  Who?  I thought Blanket Hates the Light was brilliant.  Goddamn.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Why won't my parakeet eat my diarrhea?  To get so many.  Number 17 with a bullet.  To get so many people to actually type that. 
[00:30:30]  And it won't work unless you type it the exact same way.  Yes.  How do you spell diarrhea?  That's a hard one.  Pat from Munaki wants us to Google bomb.  Moon landing was fake.  All right.  Well, now that it's coming out, sure.  It's probably up there already because a lot of people have been Googling it.  No, it's still too early in the morning, but it'll be up there.  You'll see.  You'll see.  Moon landing was fake.  That's a very good idea for a Google bomb today. 
[00:31:00]  Why won't my parakeet eat my diarrhea?  Yahoo Answers is the funniest thing to ever happen.  Yahoo Answers, yeah.  Because no one gives the right answer.  And now what they do is now, like, it's just ridiculous questions.  It's just absolutely ridiculous questions.  It used to be cool stuff.  Like, why won't my parakeet eat my diarrhea?  Right.  And then there's people that are supposed to answer it.  It's like, why don't you offer it to your cat first?  That is not the question asked.  Mix in some bird seeds. 
[00:31:30]  Mix in some bird seeds.  See, people are giving legitimate answers.  Yeah, that's a legitimate answer, Danny.  Come on.  That's awesome.  Google Answers is silly.  What was the other one?  Ask Jeeves.  Ask Jeeves.  Whatever.  The big dot-com boom.  I was going to tell a cute little story the first time someone told me about it.  Who cares?  You know, there's this surface.  That's Jeeves.  I mean, it'll answer any question.  Watch.  Watch what happens.  Wait for it.  It never really does.  Mongo the trucker. 
[00:32:00]  Mongo.  Mongo.  Yes.  I just want to let you fancy people know while you're out playing golf and playing with your  big fancy cars, I was changing in a bucket of change to pay a fucking bill.  There is still a bad economy out here.  Yeah.  I know.  Hey, man, I was there for most of my life.  People don't understand that about Ant and I.  We were there for most of our lives.  Yes.  I know, but I can't get out.  We've had a nice, let me think, we've had a nice almost 10-year run. 
[00:32:30]  Yes.  Before that, I was fucking as poor as they come.  Dirt.  Paycheck to paycheck, my friend.  Knocking tin.  Paycheck to paycheck.  I have to point up to so many people.  Yeah.  You know what I used to do?  I'd point up.  See that duct work?  Look, that was me.  And they laugh.  They love that one.  Really?  You're doing that?  Yes.  That was me.  And I caddied for 12 years.  Now I get to play on some of these fucking golf courses.  See?  Finally.  So the moon landing was a fake. 
[00:33:00]  That's a biggie today.  What else?  Probably.  Madonna killed someone.  That's also in the news.  Yeah.  What happened with the Madonna thing?  The stage collapsed or something?  Apparently.  They were building a stage?  Building a stage for her big gig.  Right.  And what?  Fell down?  Fell on somebody?  Fell down and crushed them?  Crushed a worker.  One dead.  You're kidding?  And boy, we're going to have to make up a lot of shit because that's about all that's  happening today.  That's all the big news of the day. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit, yo.  We do have Joe DeRosa coming in.  We have Mary Carrie coming in.  We have Bobo coming in.  We might get Christina.  Christina, Christina, right?  You're a possible chick.  Yeah, Christina.  Unless you're leaving her alone.  I don't know.  Christine.  Christine?  No, I'm looking.  Playing hard to get.  That's what I'm doing.  Playing hard to get.  We might get her in today.  Yeah, here it is.  Madonna's stage collapses while being built. 
[00:34:00]  Two workers die.  Not one.  Damn.  Not one.  And man arrested for murdering his wife on a carnival cruise earlier this week.  Just going to hit that one.  What?  How bad of a murderer is this guy?  This is one of our favorite stories.  We know people are taking cruises and killing their loved ones.  This is probably the easiest way to kill somebody.  And this guy fucked it up.  And someone fucking got caught?  How do you get caught?  Let's find out. 
[00:34:30]  Murder.  A man has been arrested in San Diego in the murder of his wife during a cruise to Mexico.  The FBI says Robert McGill of L.A. is being held in the death of his wife.  Surely aboard the carnival elation.  Ever been on the elation?  No, never go on carnival cruises.  Is elation the boat?  I don't know.  Sounds like it should be the boat.  Sounds like it's quite elation.  I'm elated to be on it.  Carnival says the 55-year-old woman was killed during a domestic dispute on Tuesday evening  as the ship was midway through a five-night trip to Cabo. 
[00:35:00]  The guy fucked up.  He fucked up so bad.  A dispute?  You just pushed the bitch over the side.  Right over the friggin' rail.  And then you just go, I don't know.  I don't know where she went.  And then everyone feels bad.  The ship circles three times.  And then, bing, bing, bong, da-ding, da-ding, da-ding, da-ding, da-ding, da-ding, da-ding.  Yeah, and then, all right, it's our favorite fucking story.  All right, gentlemen, it's your captain speaking.  We're going to be scouring the area for a missing passenger. 
[00:35:30]  Please continue.  The chocolate bar is open on the main deck.  The chocolate found, yes.  And remember, it's ice sculpture night tonight, so take a look at that.  All right, we did a lap.  All right, good funner.  All right, fucking off the Cabo, people.  Here we go, remember.  Yeah.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Okay, we're steaming all along to Cabo now. 
[00:36:00]  Well, now can we do it?  We got to do it now from the perspective of the person that was pushed over the side.  Yeah.  You know how it.  Oh, yeah.  All right, now it's from the perspective of the person that was pushed into the water.  Does Travis know what we're doing here?  I know we're making this up on the clock.  He was communicating.  I'm not sure if he.  Danny, eventually.  Okay.  Eventually.  Not yet.  So we're going to do it from the perspective of the poor person that, because it's got  to be.  No, no, Travis.  Yeah, well, poor Travis. 
[00:36:30]  Poor Travis.  Holy shit, Travis.  You got to, you know, make it sound like a bit.  You know better.  What are you, butchering today?  Oh, thanks.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  No hockey for you.  I'm taking Danny to the Winter Classic.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, me and Danny at Fenway.  Ah, ah, ah.  You guys are very mean.  Flyers, Bruins, and no Travis.  Ah, ah, ah.  I never loved you.  All right, here we go.  We're doing it now.  From the perspective of the domestic dispute. 
[00:37:00]  Really?  You fucking bitch.  You know something?  We go on this cruise, maybe to patch up a fucking shitty relationship.  Shitty?  Why don't you go fuck yourself?  Me go fuck myself?  What did you do?  I've been fucking the cabin, boy.  You fuck the cabin.  You fucking bitch.  You bitch.  You.  Oh, my God.  I'm in the water.  Where's the ship?  Is somebody going to? 
[00:37:30]  No, somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Are the crickets in the ocean?  Well, I was just trying to.  I caught my head.  There's one cricket on my head.  Yeah, there you go.  I was just trying to.  End scene.  I was just trying to get the feeling of loneliness out there for a bit.  And she just hears.  And Travis, you sucked on the bit.  Yeah, Travis blew the bit.  What are you talking about?  The silent partner. 
[00:38:00]  The ship has to slowly fucking fade away.  What the fuck is the thing doing like 100 miles?  It's a cigarette boat?  The woman's in the water.  She still hears the music nice and loud that she was just enjoying a mere 10 minutes ago.  And then all of a sudden that music gets, you know, fainter and fainter.  And that shows the people out there in Radioland, like, holy shit, the boat's taking off without her.  No, I think it was pretty good.  And now she's going to be alone in the ocean with the sharks by herself.  Pretty good. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, that was good.  It's a fucking, what, a speed cruise boat?  What the fuck was that?  Was it water skiing behind it?  It's one of those new cruises.  What was it?  A cigarette boat?  Yeah, that's it.  What the fuck?  I'm blaming Danny.  Your timing was horrible.  It was terrible.  You brought the volume down way too quickly.  Anyway.  You didn't give the illusion of a giant cruise ship slowly steaming away from a lost passenger.  That's how I felt.  In the water.  That's how you felt?  You're an idiot.  That was pretty good. 
[00:39:00]  No, it stunk.  He's just daydreaming about his...  I wish Dexter fell in the water.  Dexter, what?  He's daydreaming about his new daughter.  I know.  To be fair, we were discussing other music to play on the cruise ship.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Stop feeling hot, hot, hot is the song.  Stop daydreaming about your new daughter and maybe you get to go to Fenway for the Winter  Classic.  Really?  No.  Me and Danny.  What do you daydream?  Like, God, I wonder whose this is.  What?  No.  No?  No.  Danny's made that pretty clear already. 
[00:39:30]  As an Asian guy from yesterday.  So, anyway, we know there's a lot of you out there that just are done with your spouse.  So, take them on a cruise.  Yeah.  But listen to your pals, Opie and Anthony.  This guy blew it.  The FBI says Robert of L.A. is being held into the death of his wife, Shirley, aboard  the carnival elation.  This should never happen.  Because you do the...  I'm sure people are still doing the dumb Titanic thing.  Take the late night stroll on the promenade or whatever the fuck it's called. 
[00:40:00]  The promenade.  You get to an area where it's a little dangerous and then you push the bitch in.  Yeah.  Then you look around a little bit.  And then you do this.  Yeah.  And then you're done.  There's no evidence.  And here you go.  Big part.  No fucking arguing.  You can't argue.  You got to go with the mission that you are pushing that bitch into the water.  So, if you're arguing and people see it, you are suspect number one. 
[00:40:30]  I agree.  If you're having this loving time and everything's dandy, then people will be like, what I saw?  Yeah.  I saw them holding each other.  They were walking hand in hand on the poop deck.  Yeah.  Even if you can't stand.  Oh, you hate her.  You got to put up the front.  Put up the front.  And then lop that bitch over the rail.  You got to be holding her hand and making small talk with everyone you're passing before you get to the place on the ship where you're going to push her in.  I don't know where she went. 
[00:41:00]  Then you got to put on a real good show.  Real good show.  Real tears.  Put a tack in your shoe.  Put a little tack in your shoe and step on it each time you have to, I don't know.  Squeeze your fucking helmet head.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Don't tell me she might have gone over.  Check the ship again.  Check the ship again.  Just pinch your ball bag really hard.  Yeah, real hard until you got tears coming out of your eyes.  Yeah.  And then lob that bitch over. 
[00:41:30]  I also failed on the bit.  What happened?  I went with crickets and everyone's saying you should have went dolphin squeaks.  I don't have dolphin squeaks.  Oh.  I had it.  You had it.  You failed, too.  I failed.  We all failed on the bit.  Mine was just fine.  I tried as you failed the most.  Shut the fuck up.  We could have still pulled it off if the music faded slower.  How about this?  Oh, no.  I'm in the water.  Oh, no.  It's a seahorse.  It's a car in the middle of the ocean.  Jesus. 
[00:42:00]  So, this guy didn't take our advice.  He's certainly not a listener of the show.  And see, you know, now he's going to jail for a long time.  That's it.  If he was a listener of the show, he'd be all right.  He would be hanging out with bimbos right now.  Because no one finds those people.  He would be hanging out with bimbos right now getting his dick sucked.  Right?  Right.  Yeah, with chicks.  He's fucking getting his dick sucked.  FBA and Carnival would not say how she was killed.  The guy fucked up. 
[00:42:30]  He really fucked this up.  What do you think he did?  Probably hit her over the head with something in the room?  He probably bashed her head in and left a lot of forensic evidence in the room.  Dude, you want to know how much he fucked up?  Are you ready for the next line?  Crew members found the body.  What?  You, you, you.  How do you, it's the easiest place to dispose of a body.  It's on a cruise ship.  Holy, even if you kill the bitch in the room, you still have a chance.  You have a chance.  You know why?  Because the cruise ship doesn't even like bringing people on.  And what are they going to bring the Cabo Wabo fucking police department on board to collect evidence? 
[00:43:00]  They're all drunk on that goddamn Hagar tequila.  How horrific would it be?  You kill your wife in the cabin and then you're dragging her lifeless body.  As everyone's trying to have a good time on the promenade.  Yeah.  You're playing shuffleboard.  You're like just dragging this lifeless.  Ah, she's had a little too much to drink.  This lifeless lump that used to be your wife.  Flailing that drag doll over the railing. 
[00:43:30]  Then having a tough time getting her, her, you know, her, I gained 50 pounds since the wedding.  Fucking body over the railing.  And then you look at it and just go, good riddance.  You look at the splash and then just spit in the water and go, good fucking riddance.  And then what would you do?  Knowing that everyone just saw you do.  Casino.  Did you just go to the casino?  You hit the casino.  And say, fuck it?  Yeah.  And you play some cards.  You're in a good mood.  You got to stay in a good mood until somebody reports her missing. 
[00:44:00]  Which is usually you.  You got to be the guy that goes, you know.  So I was at the casino.  Right.  Well, she went back to the room.  She was a little drunk.  She went back to the room.  I just wanted to go to the casino.  And that was the last I saw her.  Why?  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  Turn the ship around.  What are you saying?  Sir, we really can't turn the boat.  No, she's my wife.  And meanwhile, you're just like, yes.  In your head.  Body gone.  And you're just picturing fucking groupers eating her eyeballs. 
[00:44:30]  And some fucking bimbo sucking your dick.  Oh, yeah.  You've already scoped out some of the single girls on the ship.  You're thinking, you've got four days left on the cruise.  You're like, you know what?  Going home?  I think I got a shot at some of these broads.  Would you like us to arrange a flight for you back home?  You know, I think I should just stay on the ship.  She would have wanted it this way.  She wouldn't have wanted me to go home.  Am I supposed to go home now and look at all the things that remind me of her? 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  All right.  You stay on the ship.  Look, we're going to give you a suite because I'm sure you don't want to be in the room that,  you know, your wife was.  It's a good idea.  Can I have a real big one with a giant bed?  Right.  Is it true?  It's bimbo night.  Can you bring breakfast in at six tomorrow?  I love the scenario where the guy wins in the end.  This guy is an idiot.  After a horrific fucking marriage. 
[00:45:30]  So the guy, the crew members found the body and later detained Robert in the brig.  The ship docked out at San Diego home port Thursday morning and the woman's body was removed.  Wow.  What a dummy.  Ready for this?  He's dumb all the way around.  The FBI sent about 20 agents to the ship in a U.S. Coast Guard cutter.  That's not good if you see that coming.  No.  And you see that thing coming in on your cruise ship. 
[00:46:00]  Wednesday night while the ship was at sea and they spent the night interviewing.  Ready for this?  The suspect.  Guess how many potential witnesses to this fucking murder?  Oh, no.  What an idiot.  How many?  How many?  Guess.  Uh, five.  Try 30 to 40.  What an idiot.  40 witnesses.  Because, because you know what?  Your temper gets the best of you.  Yeah.  But all you have to do is keep your temper under check.  Smile.  And think of the big picture, my friend. 
[00:46:30]  Smile, though your wife's a cunt.  Smile.  Smile as you give her the punt.  Right.  Just fucking think of the big.  Be nice.  Just be nice.  Hold her hand.  Do a little Titanic shit.  Yeah.  Let the anger come out in the fake sorrow.  Right.  Then you could channel that anger into fake sorrow.  We were having fun.  That fucking bitch.  Why did she have to die? 
[00:47:00]  We were going to go to the buffet.  She started really liking buffets a lot more after we got married.  A fucking lot more.  What a dolt.  God.  So you got 30 or 40 witnesses.  Passengers said they never got official word of what was going on, but rumors flew when they saw a security guard sitting outside the couple's cabin around the clock. 
[00:47:30]  Oops.  Passengers say they never got official word, but rumors flew after that line twice in the story.  That was a very important line.  What the fuck?  I get up and go to the gym at 6 a.m., and he would be there, said passenger.  How do you make relationships in a week where you know another passenger's schedule?  I see the guy in the gym all the time.  All the time.  I get up and go to the gym at 6, and he would be there, said passenger.  Actually, Arlene's easy, but I'll buy, I guess. 
[00:48:00]  I looked down the hall when I'd go back down during the day, and he would still be sitting there.  I don't know if it was the same guy, but there was always someone in front of that room.  The ship docked at 6.30 Thursday.  Medical examiner removed the woman's body about three hours later.  A medical examiner.  Yeah, where's Jim C?  I know, where's Jim C?  It was murder.  It was a girl.  She was thrown overboard.  Her name was Abigail.  I'm telling Jim C.  I don't mean to steal Jim C.'s bit. 
[00:48:30]  I'm telling Jim C.  I love Jim C.'s bit.  When he brings up stupid Abigail every time, and Monaghan's got to suck his dick or fuck him in the ass or something.  You know what?  All Jim C.'s episodes are the same.  Yeah, well, give everyone a nice Jim C.  Oh, that's what the golfer said that I almost hit yesterday.  Knowing that, he's an uber fan.  So I shank the shot.  I go to the tee box of the next hole to retrieve my ball, which is never fun for anybody.  Winter rules, you know.  Right.  And all of a sudden, the guy goes, hey, I almost needed Jim C. 
[00:49:00]  to figure out my...  I'm like, all right, dude.  Murdered with a golf ball.  He's making show references, and I'm like, look.  I'm off the clock.  Trying to golf.  I'm off the clock.  Where's my fucking ball?  I don't come to where you work and knock the dicks out of your mouth.  Oh, I get it.  You blow people for money.  He's probably listening.  He was an all right guy.  Stryker wants you on this.  Stryker.  Good morning, boys. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, ma'am.  Yeah, I just booked a cruise in February for my wife and I for our anniversary, and as  I was sitting there booking it, I was thinking about this whole bit you guys have done about  throwing her overboard, and the cruise ship we're going on at the Royal Caribbean, and  in its security details, has over 200 security cameras around the ship, and my first thought  was, well, someone, you're pushing her overboard.  That's your first thought.  I mean, some people get away with it, even with the cameras.  I think we're kind of late to this party. 
[00:50:00]  I think, I really believe that people figured out this, I could kill my spouse on a cruise  ship thing years ago, but I think the cruise ship industry is finally onto it.  Yeah, now there's a shitload of cameras.  And now there's cameras everywhere, because, I mean, think about it.  People want to kill their spouses all the time.  Yeah.  This is the easiest one.  It's one push into an ocean.  And you know what, and time is money, they will only spin around a few times before they  say, there's nothing we can do.  The fuel, and the fucking time, and everything like that, fuck that. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Striker, go ahead, sorry.  Yeah, hey, Anthony, did you watch the show on History Channel the other day about real  Terminators, and the future of robotics that's being experimented on?  Ah, it's dangerous, they've become weird.  No, I didn't.  Basically, yeah, it was a really interesting program on History Channel the other day, it's called  That's Impossible, and just watching that.  It's impossible.  Yeah, I'm sure it'll rerun 8,000 times. 
[00:51:00]  Can you give me those papers?  Jimmy's not using them today.  There's another story.  I know we need a break, but there's another story that's worth talking about, because it's  right in our wheelhouse.  In the old wheelhouse.  You hear about the, um...  That's bullshit.  Hold on a minute.  I heard a different version of this story.  Uh, all right, hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna read the other version, because this fucking  paper.  Your workbook.  Oh, the New York Post.  That paper sucks a fucking dick, trust me. 
[00:51:30]  The rag.  Fucking assholes.  I wouldn't put my diarrhea on there for my parakeet to eat.  You know what?  Next duty goes on that paper.  Oh, no.  Take it inside there.  Unfortunately, a huge snake slithered out today, so I might be good for the morning.  Long Island dad, slain uptown.  This is a horrible story, absolutely, but it's something Ant and I have talked about.  It's one of our bits, but it's a variation of one of our bits that we're still developing  after all these years. 
[00:52:00]  Motivational speaker strangled after 3 a.m.  trip to East Harlem.  Oh, boy.  A motivational speaker, listen to this, from Long Island, was found and strangled and stabbed  in his car in East Harlem, white guy in East Harlem, at 3 a.m.  Hours after he was seeing, buying, you want to guess?  Crack.  That would be the obvious answer, my friend, and I'm proud of you.  A lot of white people go uptown to get drugs.  Encyclopedias. 
[00:52:30]  Encyclopedias is not the answer.  That's what I thought it might have been uptown, to buy some period.  You got two strikes, my friend.  Some big, let's see.  I know you want to bail today.  Come on.  What else could they possibly be selling?  So let's get the drug thing out of the way, no drugs, and let's get the knowledge thing  out of the way.  No knowledge.  So what is left if there's drugs or no knowledge?  Chick.  Chick.  Good.  Prostitute.  So what was he buying at 3 a.m.? 
[00:53:00]  A pulsa.  Sort of good.  Oh, no.  Was he buying a tranny?  No.  Okay.  He was coming out of a store.  Oh.  A bodega?  He was seen buying condoms at 3 a.m. in East Harlem, New York.  What a dummy.  Sorry, I'm sorry you're dead.  How could this possibly work out for you?  Why are you doing that?  Jeffrey Locker, 52, had his hands tied behind his back and a cord wrapped around his neck  and tied to the headrest.  He had been stabbed. 
[00:53:30]  Damn.  Stabbed in the chest and robbed.  Wow.  His neck was tied to the headrest?  Like fucking Godfather.  Like they fucking, they Carlos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Carlo.  I know what you meant.  Investigators suspect there were two killers in his 2007 Dodge Magnum, one in the back  seat with the cord and one in the front passenger seat with the knife.  Teens on the block said they saw Locker park the car on 2nd Avenue and walk into the nearby  deli. 
[00:54:00]  Bodega.  About 3 a.m.  And then some guys jumped in his car, hung out when he got in.  Oh, you think that's how it went down?  I don't know.  It sounds like one of those things where he sat in there.  He got out of the car, bought a bottle of water and a pack of Trojan condoms.  He seemed cool, relaxed, said one of the Utes.  The next time we see him, he's here dead.  Wow.  Cops said they are checking to see if Locker had regularly visited a prostitute in the  Wagner houses on Wednesday nights. 
[00:54:30]  Wow.  Which goes with our whole fucking thing with the guy.  But in this case, the guy loses and not the prostitute.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy, married guy, looks like from Long Island, was getting supposedly, allegedly a  prostitute every Wednesday in East Harlem, New York.  What a dolt.  You're asking for trouble.  In the Wagner houses.  I don't even need to look up the Wagner houses, but I don't think that's a good place to be  at any time of the day.  Anything that is the something houses is bad. 
[00:55:00]  Because they're not houses.  It's big apartment buildings.  And it looks like, you know, the wire.  It looks like where they sell drugs.  The low-level guys in the wire.  Yeah.  Locker's wife.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that looks great.  This is a picture of the Wagner houses Danny found?  That's one of the elevators.  Oh, my God.  That you never would emerge alive from if you were a white person.  Oh, my God.  It looks like an institution.  What you got near, Warsh.  Yeah.  Someone's toting their laundry. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  Or a body.  Remove your head.  Fuck remove your head territory.  That's remove your head territory.  Damn.  Where is the Wagner houses?  Oh, yeah.  That's up in Manhattan.  You see, I take my bike pretty far north on the west side of Manhattan, but that side,  fuck the fuck no.  You don't go past the Triborough or the RFK now.  Is that the new border?  It's right there.  Well, you know what it is?  It's right before it.  Why didn't I get the memo? 
[00:56:00]  Why do you get memos there once in a while where the new borders are?  Don't go near that.  Is that the houses right there?  Yeah.  That whole development?  Yeah, that looks really fucking notoriously bad.  Really?  Where is the Roberto Clemente houses?  Are they close?  Because I saw those when I took my little water trip around Manhattan with NYPD.  Poor Roberto Clemente.  Yeah.  It's like named after.  So this guy.  So Locker's wife, Louise, reported him missing Wednesday night when he did not return to his  Valley Stream home.  Yeah.  Valley Stream.  It's a local dude.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  It's unclear why he was in East Harlem.  He was going into the city and coming home.  And then she goes, he was supposed to be coming home, she said.  Oh, yeah.  Without elaborating.  He was supposed to come home.  He wasn't there by choice.  I noticed his dick stank like hooker.  See, she's in denial.  Yeah, yeah.  They have a witness that saw him buying condoms at 3 in the morning in East Harlem.  What the fuck else is he doing there?  The victim was a father of three, fucking motivational speaker.  Just a horrendous story.  But it goes with what we'd say about. 
[00:57:00]  Couldn't talk those people out of killing him.  No.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, a little motivation.  Come on, guys.  I guess you weren't a great motivator.  I mean.  Well, maybe he was good.  Maybe they were just going to leave him alone, rob him.  And he's like, you know, really go the distance here, people.  Why don't you kill me?  You think?  I bet you Tony Robbins gets out of that fucking situation.  You think Tony Robbins could talk his way out of that one?  Tony Robbins would have talked his way out of it and still got pussy.  Guys.  What do you say to that?  I'm going to go fuck now.  Now that I've fucking talked you guys out of murdering me, look what I fucking do. 
[00:57:30]  I'm still getting that pussy.  Okay, Tony Robbins.  That's why I'm the greatest motivational speaker in the world.  We're going to leave you alone, Tony Robbins.  You go along your way.  You need a couple of bucks, Tony Robbins?  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Kevin.  Danny's doing the street view.  I'm sorry.  Danny's doing the street view around this place.  Holy shit.  This looks like just a horrible, horrible place.  Let's send Bobo up there.  Oh, God. 
[00:58:00]  This looks horrible.  Is she allowed to say hi to us or does she have to go right to work?  She's going right to work.  Bye.  All right.  That's Christine?  Yeah.  Why can't they just have one name?  Christine or Christine.  I don't want to have to always figure out which one it is.  Is there the A at the end or not?  Thank you.  Kevin from Connecticut reminded me that there's another beautiful way to kill your spouse.  Yeah.  This takes a little planning, but, man, there's a lot of people that want to see that Grand Canyon.  Oh, boy. 
[00:58:30]  Now, you know, you get a room for three nights.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, the first night, you're so excited to be at the Grand Canyon, but your wife's tired from the long trip.  And you're like, you know, I'm just going to go get some fresh air, maybe some smokes.  And then you go to the rim of the Grand Canyon, and you plot where you're going to take her the next day.  And then that's where you loosen the dirt right at the top of the rim.  Oh.  Nice.  Dude, somebody tried that.  No, I'm not even going with the pusharoo. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  You loosen the dirt, and then you're like, oh, you know, it'll be.  I've seen this on the Internet a lot, guys that go right to the edge of the Grand Canyon.  It makes for a terrific photo op.  Matter of fact, me and my brother did that very thing.  And then as they back up, you're like, no, a little further, a little further, knowing that you already loosened the ground, my friend.  That's creepy, though.  And you've got to make sure she does it.  She might not do it.  Because there's a guy recently that pushed his wife off a cliff.  Right.  And he got caught. 
[00:59:30]  And there was no witnesses.  No nothing.  But he got caught.  Because he pushed.  They figured it out.  They figured out what the fuck.  Holy shit.  That chick is just kind of.  Oh, yeah.  This is the thing to do when he goes to the canyon.  She's dangling her legs over the rim of the canyon.  And it's like a bottomless pit below her.  Yeah, this is definitely the thing to do.  See, that guy right there taking the picture if he didn't like her?  Yeah.  One foot to the back.  Although they would find his boot print on her back.  All right.  How about this? 
[01:00:00]  That's probably how they find it, the handprints.  Rattlesnake.  What are you fucking the Brady Bunch?  And you put the rattlesnake in.  Put the fucking tarantula.  Now she's at the edge of the Grand Canyon, and there's a rattlesnake in the area.  I saw a rattlesnake scare the shit out of her.  She jumped and fell over the side.  Oh, she fell because of the rattlesnake.  Right.  By the way, I'm happily married.  For real.  For real.  My girl has nothing to worry about.  Yeah.  We're just saying that people do. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  They do this.  Right.  They kill their spouses in horrible ways.  And some people get away with it.  Let's go back to the Wagner houses.  They're bad, Danny.  Yeah, they don't look so very good.  No.  Oh, my God.  The street view on Google is like, I don't know how that truck made it through to take  the pictures.  But this guy.  It must have been an APC.  They're saying this guy went up there every Wednesday night.  He was playing Russian roulette.  Every Wednesday night.  Guy got lucky every time.  You would go in that area once and go, you know what? 
[01:01:00]  I'm fucking never going back, right?  He probably got lulled into a false sense of security.  You think they set him up?  I don't know.  You think that he was buying condoms?  But you think the prostitute set him up?  Oh, my God.  Look at that place.  That just looks.  If I didn't know any better, I would say that's a prison.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like a prison.  Right?  Definitely.  The yard.  But I don't know.  Maybe the girl set him up, you think?  He stops to buy condoms every Wednesday.  People are making fun of me because, yeah, I did take sunset pictures at the Grand Canyon. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Do you have a fucking sunset picture from the Grand Canyon?  No.  Or did you have to buy yours?  Did you get a postcard, motherfucker?  I got a fucking sunset picture at the Grand Canyon.  Faggot.  Oh, damn.  What is that?  That doesn't look good at all.  What are you looking at now?  More Wagner houses?  Yeah, just more Harlem.  Wreckage.  More Harlem projects.  Jesus.  Oh, the projects.  Why doesn't anyone fix these projects or finish them?  You ever have a project you didn't finish? 
[01:02:00]  You know, when you're...  That's what the projects are.  You know, I mean, we're lucky.  The position we're in, we get some inside info about stuff.  Yeah.  And I'm not saying anything crazy by saying, like, these, like, projects and stuff, they  have a whole, they have a whole, like, network.  Yeah.  Of lookouts and all sorts of things that happens.  Oh, yeah.  The cops say it's almost impossible to go into these places and get anything done because  they're all not, I mean, there's a lot of people in cahoots with each other that, you  know, the main guard at the bottom, he's already calling upstairs and this guy is... 
[01:02:30]  They see him coming a mile away, yeah.  Coming a mile fucking away.  They're like, it's almost impossible to get anything done.  Yeah.  And shit's going down in those places.  And then by the time the cops get there, the drug dealers are already, you know, safe  in there.  They have their own fucking, you know, rules and laws in those places.  And if you're going to fuck prostitutes...  Three in the morning.  Three in the morning?  You might end up dead.  Three in the morning, East Harlem.  That's fucking nuts.  Wire wrapped around your neck in the headrest. 
[01:03:00]  You're so done when they do that.  And then stabbed on top of it.  And then stabbed.  So.  All right, why don't we take our first break?  Good start to the show today.  What else are we doing?  Oh, Breepart picked up our fine interview with Ian Halperin.  Yes.  That's got some legs today.  Because the guy apparently...  Oh, great.  Bloods and Crips friggin' bandanas tied around the 106th Street sign.  That can only mean trouble.  If you can't...  What's the street?  101...  I can't see because there's a red and a blue bandana tied around it. 
[01:03:30]  Marty, go outside and remove that red bandana.  And could you ask these young gentlemen for directions?  Right.  While waving the bandana at him?  All right, that's the Roberto Clemente projects.  I know.  Oh, yeah?  Right, Danny?  Well, what?  This one right here?  Or the...  This one is the Jackie Robinson houses.  No, go to the next one up top.  Up top?  Why aren't they ever the Albert Einstein houses?  I've never been to the Albert Einstein houses.  The Oppenheimer houses. 
[01:04:00]  I've never...  Oh.  Speaking of...  You know...  We're going to do Gypsy for everybody.  The Neil Armstrong housing complex.  You never see that.  No.  Gypsy.  The Larry Bird housing project.  No.  Thinking extremely white athletes instead of black athletes.  See what I did there?  Exactly.  Ian Halperin.  What were you saying about that?  You had a little knowledge on that?  On...  Oh, I was just saying how everybody kind of gave him a pass whenever he was on an interview. 
[01:04:30]  I believe so, yeah.  You know?  They just kind of listen to his babble and don't call him out.  And I think that's why I got picked up is because we were just calling him out on things.  And Jimmy was just lambasting.  Jimmy was front and center in that one.  Absolutely.  He slayed him.  The whole interview's on Breepart.  It's about 40 minutes long.  Breepart.  We put a video up on OP Radio, the YouTube channel.  Yeah.  So you could see what the douche looks like. 
[01:05:00]  I don't even know if I want to call him a douche anymore, though.  He was highly entertaining.  He was...  Is that...  Is that...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean I have to like the guy, but he was very entertaining.  He could still be a douche.  I'm confused.  Douchees can be entertaining.  I don't know how to label the guy.  Asshole.  Because, I mean, I think you said the same thing.  We wanted to hate the guy, and we thought it was going to get...  And we did.  Did we by the end of it?  I don't know if it was hatred.  Because it was sort of a work on his part.  Yeah, yeah.  You could tell he was kind of doing a work.  But...  With that said, we got a little...  So douchey. 
[01:05:30]  His voice was douchey.  Rooney?  These are not my words.  This is...  These are the words of Michael Jackson, Rooney.  Right.  Asshole.  The world's greatest entertainer of all time.  Were you there?  Yeah.  The pub king of Chicago.  Right.  Yeah.  Gotta watch that fucking movie now.  That's a good one.  Detective Peterson.  Peterson?  Chicago police. 
[01:06:00]  Rooney!  Well, we got Ian Halperin defending Canada in this nice little production piece as we go  to break.  Good luck.  Is Joe DeRosa here?  Yes.  Ooh.  Nice.  We'll add him to the show next.  I like how the show, we just develop it as we go.  That's smart.  That's how it works.  Everyone else has it all planned out ahead of time.  We just kind of develop shit every day.  We're show developers.  That's right.  And then Bobo?  Oh, great.  Is he helping with the show?  Is he going to co-host?  Dude, we had that great hour last Friday with the Queen's Motor and stuff. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  And we haven't talked about Bobo since.  Or gotten an update.  So I think that's going to be pretty cool.  I want to know how it's going because I've, you know something, I caught a lot of shit  for attempting to steal Bobo's chick.  For real?  No.  Okay.  It's just purely for the show.  I caught a lot of shit for trying to steal Bobo's chick.  So I figured I'd just leave it alone.  Let it run its course.  See what happens before I make my move.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  We got some real good Bobo info. 
[01:07:00]  Bobo info.  Well, Bobo.  It's fun to say.  Sorry.  No, I'm trying to tease something without giving it away.  We got good Bobo stuff, right?  I guess that's okay.  Are we going to do that after the break a little bit?  It's ready.  Your hair looks like shit.  It does not.  It's all over.  It's poking out.  Now, you used to have a nice pom-pom in the back.  And now you're ready for a second pom-pom ponytail.  Because now it's growing crazy in the pom-pom.  So you got to put a ponytail in that. 
[01:07:30]  Afro Wars.  Could you try to do that today?  Put it in another pom-pom?  Yeah.  Try a pom-pom on the pom-pom.  We're going for double scoop now.  Let's do it.  All right.  Give it a try.  Is this still Afro Wars?  Yeah.  I'm still beating Danny's ass.  This is Afro Wars that started or ended over a year ago.  It was done.  The contest is over.  A year and a half.  It was a throwaway in the first place.  Wait a minute.  It was against East Side Dave.  Yes.  And I destroyed him for the record. 
[01:08:00]  You won officially.  Annihilated.  Since then, you still haven't cut your hair.  And he went through a whole beard competition.  And that ended at least six months ago.  Oh, yeah.  And you guys are still in Afro Wars even though there's no competition.  Except now you and Danny have decided the competition is between yourselves.  It's bragging rights now.  Well, here's the thing.  How about you both cut your hair at the same time?  Let's get it over with.  I would do that.  But I initially went into Afro Wars thinking just competition.  Yeah.  And then I realized I've ended up with a very handsome look. 
[01:08:30]  So.  What a douche.  You know, this is kind of my thing now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does your chick grab it like Brillo and scour her bush area with your face?  Does it just scour it like it's a pot?  I don't think she likes it.  She keeps her hands away from my hair.  Away from your hair?  It does look infested.  It's not.  It looks like it could be.  I didn't say it is, sir.  What kind of.  I said it looks as if it should be infested with something.  What kind of critters live in there? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  There was a bug literally stuck in it.  We went to.  I see.  There are bugs then.  The park over the weekend.  And there was a bug in there?  There was a bug stuck in it that not only was it like in there, but Jess tried to pull.  Is it a family?  No.  Jess tried to just like kind of flick it out.  Yeah.  Stuck.  Deeper in.  It had to be pulled like it took a couple minutes.  Your hair is like a Venus flytrap.  That's right.  It's a roach motel on your head.  I like Venus flytrap.  Not roach motel.  It's the same thing. 
[01:09:30]  More importantly, do you get more guys?  What are you talking about?  The way you kiss guys.  You know, do you get more guys with this hairdo?  What guys to kiss?  I've never been after guys.  We just discussed Jess, who is my girlfriend.  So.  Jess.  I got a thousand jokes for what Danny's popped up.  I got a video of Jess pulling some bugs in his head.  Two gorillas grooming each other.  Does she groom you like a monkey?  No.  Where they take their fingers and look in and then just pop bugs in their mouth. 
[01:10:00]  Does she do that?  It's a habit of wild animals and uncivilized beings.  Oh, okay.  I'm a human being.  Are you?  Righty.  Just in society.  I haven't seen you out of the ponytail pom-pom look in quite a while.  Well, yeah.  That must really look.  Could you like tease your hair up for everybody today?  Yeah.  How about you tease your hair up?  Yeah.  Take out the ponytail thing.  And then tease your hair up.  Let's see it real big.  Okay.  Let's see.  There's unnecessary.  What happened?  We were just talking about hairstyles and you. 
[01:10:30]  It sounded fun.  No.  That's suicide.  We're on the 36th floor.  Jump out the window.  There's no way I could survive that fall.  You might.  You might.  You could land on your hair.  Yeah.  Seriously.  It's just an experiment for the show.  Pull it out.  Okay.  Tease it up.  Yeah.  Jump out the window.  No.  I won't do it.  And then show us it teased and then go for the double ponytail.  And then slit your wrist.  And then slit your wrist.  I won't slit my wrist, but.  How about you slit your wrist as you jump out the window just to make sure? 
[01:11:00]  That would be nice.  I'm not going to kill myself.  I'll just tease my hair a little bit.  Yeah.  Put a shotgun in your mouth.  Like you tease all the guys out there, right?  I don't tease guys.  I want to kiss more guys.  Oh.  See?  I knew it.  At this point, everybody knows that is a prerecorded, out of context drop, as they call  it in the business.  Oh, is it?  I was supposed to say in the biz.  In the biz.  How about you drop out the window?  No.  I'm not going to kill myself.  I just won't.  But just think of the show.  Yeah.  You know, you're not. 
[01:11:30]  The ratings would be terrific.  Your lack of dedication for the program now is really.  You're really slacking.  Yeah.  You used to do anything for us.  Anything we asked you would do.  And now you won't even jump out the 36th floor window.  Your name is correct.  Your name will live on.  Trust me.  Yeah.  You'll be a legend.  But my body won't.  And my mind won't.  In the end, it doesn't really matter.  No one cares.  I still enjoy Nirvana to this day.  Yeah.  See?  And he's long gone.  People listen to, I'm Sam Roberts.  You know?  Yeah.  I'm primetime.  And I'm primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:12:00]  You've recorded enough stuff where we could even make new primetime Sam Roberts bits.  Like Tupac?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little Tupac.  Lost tapes.  You'll live forever.  I enjoy life.  Like Kurt Cobain was at a point where he no longer enjoys.  Yeah.  But does anyone really enjoy you?  We don't enjoy your life.  Right.  See?  Exactly.  We enjoy your radio bits.  But do we really enjoy you?  Oh my God.  Probably not.  Right.  What are you doing?  Well, this is a picture Danny pulled up of me with some of the celebrities I've met.  For instance, Crash Bandicoot.  Who the fuck is Crash? 
[01:12:30]  I thought it was Banjo-Kazooie.  I'm sorry.  No, that is Crash Bandicoot of PlayStation fame.  Really?  Yes.  He's the Super Mario of PlayStation.  And I was lucky enough to meet Crash Bandicoot at Universal Studios.  You didn't meet him because he is a computer thing.  And you met a guy in a fuzzy suit.  You met a fucking mascot for a team that doesn't exist.  And we're not lucky because he didn't shoot you.  Yeah.  Okay.  See?  That's another death.  And by the way, I'm right outside.  Yeah, I was about to say big cameo by Doc Brown there in the background.  Doc Brown's chicken. 
[01:13:00]  That's right.  I ate at Doc Brown's chicken.  Why did they put Doc Brown's chicken?  It doesn't make sense.  Why would Doc Brown have a chicken place?  He loved chicken.  That's one of the outtakes.  But in conclusion.  I've seen everything on the bonus disc.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a different thing.  There's nothing about Doc Brown's chicken.  Speaking of out.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Today the day.  For what?  Out.  No, I'm not.  You mean like, yes.  There's no closet to come out of. 
[01:13:30]  Closet.  Closet.  What the hell?  There's no closet to come out of.  How about a window to go out of?  No, I won't kill myself.  One of these windows got to open around here.  Yeah.  I know we're about 40 floors up.  If not, you could really.  Well, okay.  Here it is.  Instead of just jumping out a window.  How about you run and fling yourself against the glass and see if it breaks?  Yeah, it won't break.  It's too thick.  It's real thick.  Even if it didn't, I'd probably be injured or something.  No, do it over and over.  All of a sudden you don't trust us?  I'd look very unprofessional. 
[01:14:00]  That's for sure.  No, you got to just make sure, you know.  Is that the only tie-in they could come up with for him and Chicken?  The finest chicken of all time?  Yeah.  Being that he is a time traveler.  Looks nothing like him, by the way.  Of course not.  They got lazy.  They didn't want to spend the money for a real artist.  Chicken.  It was a fun place to go.  What a fucking.  It was no different than any food establishment at any theme park.  There was nothing themed inside.  It was just a sign. 
[01:14:30]  What?  Can we go back to that other picture?  Because Sniper from Whack Bag makes a very good observation.  The Crash Bandicoot shot?  Yes.  You were at a plushie convention.  No, I wasn't.  I didn't realize you were into plushies.  Plushies.  Plushies.  What's your plushie character?  I don't have a plushie character.  What would Sam's plushie character be at for the plushie convention?  Bandicoot.  That's Crash Bandicoot.  Bandicoot.  What would your plushie character be?  I have no idea.  I have no point of reference.  What would we dress him like?  Let's dress you in a big oversized koala bear outfit and send you to the plushie convention. 
[01:15:00]  That would be adorable.  They would love you.  You would look awesome.  You would be very cute.  Koala bears are very cute, but it's not something that I would find sexually gratifying.  Don't you find it weird to have sex with other plushies?  I would find that weird.  I've never done it.  You've never done that?  No.  Why would I?  Because you're a plushie lover.  I'm not a plushie lover.  That just came out.  Do you just cut out the areas that you need to access?  I don't need to access. 
[01:15:30]  I'm not a plushie or a plushie lover.  Why is Danny at this picture of somebody dressed as Pepe Le Pew?  That is fantastic.  There's a Pepe Le Pew.  Is that even?  No, that's just a stuffed animal with a dildo.  With a big dick dildo of Pepe Le Pew.  And it's fucking a girl doggy style.  God damn.  She's spreading her ass.  Yeah, what's up with that?  That is fucking weird.  Because you know what?  It's not even a goof picture. 
[01:16:00]  She looks like she's really into it.  There's something almost hot about it.  Really?  Just that she's naked.  Maybe you're the plushie.  No, no.  Oh, shit.  Now you're fired.  Did he just say that?  No, I was just saying maybe.  I was just bringing up a...  I thought we were all kind of having fun together.  Shooting the breeze.  She's sucking on the rubber dick of Pepe Le Pew.  And then she's letting Pepe Le Pew titty fuck her.  And she looks like a librarian.  You know what?  More importantly, how the fuck does Danny know this picture even exists? 
[01:16:30]  Danny is the king.  Of plushies.  Of all internet searches.  So you didn't answer my question.  When you dress like a plushie, do you cut out the areas that you need to access?  I will say, for the record, that is...  The asshole and the genital area.  I wasn't saying where.  I was just calling you an asshole.  Oh, right.  Well, that is a trick question because if I answered it, it would imply that I was a plushie, which I am not.  And maybe little cutouts around the nipple area.  No.  Fucking kung fu?  What is this?  I saw right through. 
[01:17:00]  You guys all of a sudden got some logic behind it?  That's right.  That is a trick question.  If I answer it, ah, very good.  You have learned well.  Yes, exactly.  My plushie.  We need to make a correction.  Oh, all right.  Thank you, Danny.  What?  Plushies are people that have a fetish for having sex with stuffed animals.  It's furries.  Oh, you're a furry.  You dress up.  No.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, neither of those two things.  You've got to be one of the two.  Are you a furry or a furry?  I mean, come on.  There's not another choice.  Oh, God.  That's not just like. 
[01:17:30]  Felt like you put on a pig mask and blow someone at the overlook?  No.  Dude, you have to, for all kidding aside, dress as a, what are they, fluffies?  Furries.  Furries, sorry.  Furries.  You have to dress up as a furry and go to one of their conventions.  That would be great.  Okay, I might do that.  Is there one coming close?  Does anyone know out there?  Obviously, I do not know.  Find out if there's.  Well, he could be.  There's going to be one at the Javits Center, I'm sure.  Well, he could be a plushie too, right, Dan?  So, if there's a plushie convention or a furry convention coming somewhere to the tri-state area, 
[01:18:00]  please let us know because Sam's going to go undercover as a raccoon.  Yeah.  You know every single suit is just matted with cum.  Like, there's no.  How do you get the cum out of your suit, Sam?  Yeah, how do you get the cum out of your fursuit?  Well, there's a two-prong attack there.  Yeah.  Because, number one.  So, you said well, so you know what we're getting at.  No.  Because, number one, I don't have a furry suit because I'm not a plushie.  Number two, if I was a plushie, there would not be cum on the suit because I would not be cummed upon. 
[01:18:30]  Well, it could be your own cum.  Anthony, I've got to tell you something.  This Sam's a very good actor.  He really is.  You're almost believable.  Meaning, well, I'm not acting.  What?  I'm not gay and I'm not a furry.  Or a plushie.  Or a fairy.  Character.  Or a fairy for that matter.  We've got to cast you in a project, man.  Your acting is terrific.  Well, I would accept the casting, but I'm not acting at this moment.  I almost believed you. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  That's crazy.  I wish you would.  Oh, wow.  Is that a big...  See, amongst those plushies and furries, I'm nowhere to be found because it's not a lifestyle.  I mean, we just haven't found you yet.  It's like a Where's Waldo picture.  I'm not there.  Where's homo?  Yeah, where's...  Let me think.  Which one would be Sam?  I'm not there.  Look at the cute little raccoon.  No, he wouldn't be a raccoon.  No?  That's too obvious.  I'm looking.  This is an entire collection.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  There's that...  Oh, my.  By Martian.  Marvin Martian.  Sam's getting a hard on right now.  I'm not getting a hard on.  I'm flaccid.  Oh, my.  I'm being fucked in the ass.  Sam, which one would you be there?  Yeah, which one would you be?  You have to pick one.  If I had to pick one?  Yes.  We're looking at a whole fucking group of plushies or furries.  Now you got me all fucked up with this.  These are furries.  These are furries.  And what's a plushie?  Oh, plushie is just having sex with a stuffed animal that has nobody inside. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  Gotcha.  All right.  Which furry would you be there, Sam?  If I had to.  Look, Sal's there in his captain's uniform.  Which furry would you be?  Ro, I'm a furry.  Well, it would definitely be a blue one.  I guess maybe that...  The unicorn?  No, not the unicorn.  Maybe that...  Why would you definitely be in a blue one?  Yeah.  Because you're like the blue guys.  He needed the money.  Oh, that's a nice one.  The little bobcat looking one. 
[01:20:30]  No, I don't want to be a bobcat.  Come on.  Which blue fucking furry would you be?  Joe DeRosa standing by.  I guess...  The one in the back there.  A blue wolf?  Or maybe whatever that is.  Whatever this guy is right here.  Oh, yeah.  That guy's cool.  Which one's that?  A fish or a dragon.  Oh, wow.  That is wild.  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, you'd look great sucking a cock in that.  Well, why does that have to go in that direction immediately?  You're right.  It's almost not gay because it's kind of a cool one.  Yeah, because you're in a cool blue...  You're in a cool blue fucking...  Well, that doesn't imply homosexuality. 
[01:21:00]  No, well, you know, I'm not saying that every furry is a homosexual, but I'm saying that you are.  Well, I'm neither of those two.  It's not gay if you're dressed as a furry.  Yeah.  I'm not...  Relax.  Look it up in the handbook.  I don't have a handbook.  I don't dress as a furry.  Or a plushie.  With your naughty parts cut out.  Naughty parts.  My naughty parts are kept covered by normal person pants.  How about you just dress up as a furry and jump out the window? 
[01:21:30]  Why?  Because I don't die.  Because he'd look silly on the sidewalk.  Sam just missed one of the biggest furry conventions in the United States.  Damn, where was it?  Where did he miss it?  No, it was July 2nd through the 5th.  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Damn it.  You were away the July 4th weekend.  Yeah.  I was in...  No, I was in the Adirondacks.  Well, I know you tweeted a picture, but anyone can grab a picture.  I was in the Adirondacks.  Anyone can grab a picture from the internet and say, look, I'm here when you're really somewhere else, Sam. 
[01:22:00]  I was not at a plushie or furry convention.  I was in the mountains.  Were you the party bottom?  No!  Who are the Adirondacks?  It's not a...  Were you the sloppy party bottom?  A bunch of two guys.  No.  At the furry convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Two big gentlemen called the mountains?  No.  No?  No.  Dressed up like mountains?  You're in the mountains?  I was at the Adirondacks.  Oh.  At.  Yeah, we believe you.  In a cabin.  No problem.  We believe you, Sam.  At Ron's dick? 
[01:22:30]  What?  What?  I didn't know what you just said.  It sounded like you're doing something...  Adirondacks.  It's in New York.  Oh.  Yeah, we believe you.  Oh, God.  Good news, Sam.  Good news.  Please tell me.  Coming up later this year, you can attend the 2009 Fur Fright in Waterbury, Connecticut.  Oh, shit, yo.  All right, listen.  Because we're fucking assholes on this show, we will completely forget.  Someone remind us that Sam is going to this furry convention in Waterbury, Connecticut later this year. 
[01:23:00]  Because I will...  Fur Fright?  Fur Fright.  Fur Fright.  Fur Fright.  Okay.  Fur Fright.  We have to get you a great costume.  Yeah, what do you want to wear to the Fur Fright in Waterbury, Connecticut?  What do I want to wear?  You're going undercover, my friend.  Wow.  I don't know what I want to wear.  I've never...  I have no point of reference.  You know how bad...  Oh, what's that?  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, something like that.  You puny beasts will come to Fur Fright or I'll drag you there piece by piece. 
[01:23:30]  Abominable snowman.  Or some kind of sasquatch.  Some kind of sasquatch.  You'll be ass-squatch.  Or squash.  Yeah, ass-squatch.  Where your ass is cut out of the suit.  Dude, you can't give your costume away because I guarantee there's a few people listening that are actual furries and they're going to this thing.  Oh, well then I won't be a sasquatch.  You've got to keep your costume top secret. 
[01:24:00]  You're going undercover, my friend.  You know how bad those would smell, the costumes?  Oh, yeah.  It's just full of sweat and cum and pre-cum and shit.  Well, I'll buy a new one.  I'm not going to be renting.  No?  Yeah, but...  You could borrow one from a furry...  Steve?  Hey, Sam.  Just shave him.  We want you to take this assignment very seriously.  You've got to be all in.  I mean, ass-sex, blowjobs.  You've got to do everything.  Yeah, you really do have to.  I will go undercover in an interview, but I will not go undercover and partake in the sexual actions.  No, you have to.  There's no reason to. 
[01:24:30]  No, you have to.  Dude, you have to.  You have to.  Why?  Because you just have to.  Because it's the only...  Either that or you're fired.  I mean, it's really up to you.  You're not getting the realism of the experience if you just walk around like that.  Right.  You've got to be like an undercover cop that actually snorts the coke.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's just got to be like training day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  In this case, you're snorting the coke.  So, you know.  Jobs are not easy to come by in this economy.  That's right.  So you better do this right.  This is what you've got to do.  It's not anything I want to.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:25:00]  Some guy dressed up as like a geisha girl, but he's wearing like tube socks.  Yeah, he's got tube socks and shorts underneath.  Maybe I'll do something like that.  Yeah.  Now there's some kind of an animal stuffed animal guy playing a keyboard.  That's pretty sweet.  Matt on Long Island, I know we're trying to break, but we might go for the world record  today.  Two hours without stopping.  Oh my goodness.  Matt on Long Island.  Matt.  Yeah.  Sam will be the first plushie in history that's more manly with the costume on than off. 
[01:25:30]  What's that supposed to mean?  You look like a fruit?  I do not.  That's incorrect and just a dumb statement.  Wow, this is a big thing.  Yeah, the furry convention or the Fur Fright.  It's going to be Fur Fright.  That guy's just got a tail.  We're looking at old pictures of Fur Fright.  Yeah, this was Fur Fright 07.  Oh, 07.  That was a good one.  Sam, this is perfect for you.  It's not perfect for me at all.  You're going to find a lot of new friends there.  Waterbury, Connecticut.  No, I'm not going to ever talk to any of those people after this convention again. 
[01:26:00]  Can't wait.  Mm-hmm.  Can't wait to see you in action.  What about all the connections you make?  I'm not going to make any connections.  I have nothing in common with furries.  Everybody wants to know when Fur Fright is.  It's around Halloween.  That's why Fur Fright.  Sorry you're going to miss our great Halloween party with hot chicks.  You have to go undercover.  Like last year's?  I'd rather have been at a furry convention than our stupid Halloween party last year.  Oh, good point.  There might be hot chick furries.  You don't know.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  They've got some fun games where you can play DDR and some Razor rollerboard scooter race. 
[01:26:30]  I'm not doing that.  How come through all of these pictures?  No, you're doing everything at Fur Fright.  Every activity.  Every activity.  You're going to sign up for every activity.  Oh, sword fighting.  Look, they're doing sword fights.  What, are they LARPing?  I don't know.  It looks like they're playing musical chairs in their fursuits with pool noodles.  I'm not doing that.  With pool noodles.  They're fighting with pool noodles dressed as furries.  I don't see one woman.  There's a woman with an owl. 
[01:27:00]  With an owl.  We got a request from Marcel.  What is Marcel?  He wants you to say costume.  Costume.  Yeah.  Oh, costume.  That's right.  And Marcel writes, and he wrote it correctly.  He goes, can you guys make Sam say costume?  And he wrote it C-O-S-H-T-U-M-E.  And then proceed to kick him in the teeth.  No, you can't kick me in the teeth.  So say costume, and Mars is going to kick you in the teeth, because he's the only one that  could get his foot out.  No, Mars, you can't.  Mars, could you kick him in the teeth for me? 
[01:27:30]  No.  No.  I would love to.  Say costume.  Costume.  Keep your foot down.  Costume.  Keep it down.  Why do you say it like that?  Stop saying it like that.  I've picked up that.  It's a regional dialect.  We're a national show.  I love how it just makes Anthony very mad.  I hate the way you say it.  We all mispronounce stuff on this show, but that's the worst one.  Costume.  What makes the choom sound?  The T-U-M-E, because it's a short U, right?  No, it's a long U. 
[01:28:00]  I think it's from...  No, you put like a C-H in there.  Along U with the T when it's pronounced together, choom, choom, not choom, costume, costume.  It's like T-H.  You don't go tth.  You go thuh.  Costume.  Yeah, that's a rule that everyone knows.  It's like costume.  And this comes from me.  I don't pronounce that well at times, but I don't say costume.  Costume.  So when you eat stew, do you eat stew? 
[01:28:30]  No, because that's an E.  Wait, what's another word that rhymes with costume?  But it's S-Costume.  C-O-S-T-U-M.  Costume.  It's the T and the U.  And it's a long U.  But stew is S-T-E-W.  But you slow down the...  Stew.  But you slow down the whole word in the middle.  Costume.  You go costume.  I'm going to wear a costume. 
[01:29:00]  Costume.  My dad pronounces Massachusetts, Massachusetts.  That's a big one.  No, he doesn't.  I've heard a lot of people say Massachusetts or whatever, yeah.  Massachusetts.  Oh, that's...  Well, a lot of people say costume.  No, not a lot of people.  I've never heard it that way in my life.  You do, and it's stupid.  Well, I've never been criticized this way before.  You should have been.  Sam, bad news.  Waterbury is in Schwuggyville.  Well, you know what?  Furry Fright is going to be in Schwuggyville.  That's all right. 
[01:29:30]  I don't know.  They ain't going to fuck with the furries.  They're not going to mess with the furries?  No, no.  They will run away from the furries.  Yeah.  They're like...  Dude, there's a furry convention.  The Wanderers Gang.  Wow, they got a carnival cruise ship for furries?  I'm not going on the cruise ship.  Why not?  Oh, wow.  Then we can push overboard.  Well, first of all...  That'd be great.  I was thinking...  Because I don't want to be stuck with Scott.  I want to use Danny's line so bad, I just can't do it to him.  You can't.  No, I can't do it.  Go ahead.  What? 
[01:30:00]  It's Fat Matt from yesterday, who's a mess usually.  He looks like a young Michael Moore with the crazy, like, scrubby beard.  Very gruff, scrubby beard.  And the hair was kind of growing out.  Wild hair.  It was in that awkward stage, not too long, not short enough, and now you're completely  clean shaven.  Clean shaven.  With a buzz cut.  Completely different look from yesterday.  Yeah.  And Danny, we were all trying to figure out what you looked like there.  Yeah, because we were saying you looked familiar. 
[01:30:30]  And Danny, Danny, what do you say?  Matt now looks like Chastity Bono.  You do.  Chaz Bono.  You're right, you're right.  Well, I think she goes by Chaz now.  Chaz, yes, Chaz Bono.  He goes, you do, and points at him.  He does.  What, uh, wow, that, you could have actually killed somebody, and then gone through this  transformation, and they never would have found you or caught you.  Damn, that is fucking uncanny.  You guys have the same size titties, too. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, fuck.  I think she's bigger by half a cup size.  Danny said you got titties.  We all heard it, Sam.  It was awkward.  Do I feel them?  The first time we heard it.  It was funny.  Oh, God.  That looks like him.  Oh, how do you say fortune?  In a costume.  A brat in Philly.  Thank you.  Fortune.  What?  Fortune?  Fortune.  F-O-R-T-U-N-E is fortune.  Because C-A, you get ch.  But you almost say chin. 
[01:31:30]  Fortune.  Fortune.  Fortune.  Fortune.  Foreskin.  Foreskin?  I don't even know how to say half these words.  It's fortune.  Fortune.  Nobody says fortune.  Fortune.  That's right.  You don't say costume because you don't say fortune.  No, you say costume.  Say costume.  Fortune.  No, costume.  You don't say fortune.  Oh, very good.  This is very good.  Everyone's helping you out for the furry convention that's going to be in Waterbury, Connecticut.  Oh, great.  Fantastic.  No, this is really good, Sam.  Oh, good.  Awesome.  Can't wait. 
[01:32:00]  Okay.  Whatever his costume, and they're all spelling it the way you say it, it must have a very prominent  fuzzy red asshole and vulva.  Vulva.  So, you're thinking like a baboon, maybe.  No.  Maybe a baboon with a big red mandrel ass.  I don't think it means like monkey hemorrhoids.  Playing hard to get, right?  No hard to get. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, you don't want to be that.  I'll say posture.  Posture.  Goddamn.  Why is costume?  Because it's not posture.  Look who's getting proved right today by the fans.  Try as you might.  By the fans.  Great.  That's always a great thing.  Costume.  Fortune.  Posture.  Boom, boom, boom.  Costume.  Yeah, there you go.  Costume.  I was going to say that.  How about that?  That's pretty sweet just because of the Mohawk thing.  Do you say studio? 
[01:33:00]  People want to know.  Uh-uh.  No, because it's not.  Please kick Sam out of the studio and throw him off the roof.  That just came in from Vanderslice.  It's not a long U.  It's studio.  There's no E at the end.  He's got an answer for everything, this kid.  How do you say Google?  Google.  Google.  Google.  Google.  Google.  Google.  What the fuck is that guy doing?  What is that?  Is she wearing a tail?  Yeah.  And the guy is biting her tail?  Why?  It's just a piece of. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  I don't know, Sam.  She's actually not that bad for where she is.  She's probably the hottest chick at the fucking stupid convention.  People are saying that Sam sounds like Ken.  New Hampshire.  And he's spelling it like you say costume.  New Hampshire.  Well, he writes.  Did he say New Hampshire?  He types it so it sounds like New Hampshire.  Sam sounds like that episode of Family Guy when Stewie says Cool Whip weird.  Cool Whip.  I don't know if I saw that one. 
[01:34:00]  And Ken's saying it's a good clip to play, so maybe we can take a listen and see if it's worth putting it to the show.  How did Stewie say Cool Whip?  I don't know.  Cool Whip.  Yeah, he goes Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Really?  That's not how you pronounce Cool Whip.  People want to Google bomb, how do you get the cum out of fursuit?  That's Kevin.  Oh, that's very good.  People are really helping you out there, Sam.  Oh, good.  I'm just so appreciative.  Let's go with Dave.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning. 
[01:34:30]  Sam could say post-humus.  Ah, ah, very good.  What is that?  When something is given to you after you have died, it is awarded posthumously.  Posthumously.  Posthumously.  He almost says posthumously.  Posthumously.  Posthumously.  Posthumously.  Posthumous.  Posthumous.  Yeah, posthumous.  Posthumous.  Posthumous.  Someone wants Sam to just say douche. 
[01:35:00]  Douche.  As in?  As in what?  You're a.  Why?  Well, I don't know.  Jimmy James.  Jimmy James.  Good morning, boys.  What's up?  I got a suggestion for Sam's plushie costume.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  We got to dress him up as a toy monkey with the symbols and all.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And then you could smile.  I don't want to do that.  Big smile where your lips go up and then you just ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.  You do the monkey. 
[01:35:30]  What's the hat?  Ting, ting, ting, ting.  Can we still throw him off a roof, though?  Oh, it would make a cool clinging sound.  There he is.  Yeah.  Oh, Sam.  That would be a great costume.  Costume?  Costume?  What's wrong with you?  Costume.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Do you know how sad the listeners would be if you guys made me kill myself?  No.  Very good news, Sam.  We got in for the fur fright.  Chris in Boston.  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Oh, actually, it's Borfiston.  Borfiston. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  Frightening.  Oh, Kevin from Canada.  Very good idea.  Have Sam say, Opie, I quit.  I'm not saying that.  I won't say it because you know why?  I think one step ahead of you, you will take it out of context and use it isolated.  So I won't say it.  What won't you say?  No, I won't even say that.  What?  Well, what won't you say?  You know how radio works?  They want me to say Opie and then I...  What?  Cool.  No, well, you heard it from Opie.  I didn't hear anything. 
[01:36:30]  I was looking at the monkey shines thing.  People are tuning in.  They have no idea what's going on.  So now explain it to them.  What won't you say?  Right.  I won't say.  I won't tell Opie that I...  I won't tell him that I don't want to work here.  That could probably also be you.  Oh, no.  So you don't want to work here?  So you don't want to...  Oh, no.  So you don't want to work here?  I absolutely want to work here.  You were hoping that we'd be like, no, Sam. 
[01:37:00]  I do want to work here.  If you don't want to work here, it's fine.  I didn't say that.  All of you guys ready to move up.  I know that, but I want to work here.  I work very hard.  That's why.  I think Bobo's on par with you.  We can move more right in.  Bobo's not even close to him.  So you don't want to work here anymore.  That's fine.  If you just don't...  If you want to quit...  Bobo's sitting in a chair staring at his picture taped to a wall down the hall.  Is he really?  Yes, of course he is.  That's the wonderfulness of Bobo.  We're sort of running out of steam. 
[01:37:30]  I was going for two hours without breaking.  Can we make it to eight o'clock?  We're not running out of steam.  No?  Should we go for it?  Let's go for it.  Oh, yeah.  Should we go for eight o'clock?  Let's just go.  Let's do it.  Two straight hours of radio?  Yeah!  How excited he is.  All right.  We got Chris from Barfiston checking in.  Hi, Chris.  Hey, guys.  I actually dated a guy who organizes...  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's something odd with the sentence you just said.  Wait.  You dated a guy?  Yes.  Oh, you dated a gentleman. 
[01:38:00]  You're the homosexual.  Sex, you will.  I get it.  Does the gay community say costume, or is Sam the only gay guy that says it?  I'm not gay.  Costume.  You say costume, right?  I actually say costume.  Exactly.  So even though you're gay, you say it like a man.  No, that's the gay way to say it.  Although, you could be a man and gay, all right?  Oh, he is a man, yes.  He's just a man that likes other men.  He can be a man.  You're just a man that likes cock.  I don't know.  When did you know, son? 
[01:38:30]  When did I know?  God, I don't know.  Since I was like six.  But I'm 38 now, so I've had some time.  What about you, Sam?  When did you know?  And not gay, so never that realization.  But I tell you this.  Then why the bright yellow shirt?  Because colors are very in right now.  Colors are in?  Yeah, colors are very in right now.  As opposed to when we were all black and white?  Right.  What are you even talking about?  No, I'm saying bright colors are very in right now.  There was a time when bright colors were like, what are you doing?  How do you know about fashion?  How do you know?  Yeah.  How do you know so much about fashion?  I keep up to date on what's going on in the fashion world. 
[01:39:00]  And why are you getting uptight?  Yeah.  Because you guys are starting to look at me like you're implying like, oh, here we go.  We're getting ready to.  Why are you getting all bitchy?  I'm getting bitchy.  And cunty.  Those are feminine characteristics.  And why is your favorite word fabulous?  It's not.  I never even say.  You said your shirt is fabulous.  Every time you hand in a prime time with Sam Roberts, you go, look, you got to play this  one.  It's fabulous.  First of all, my segments are always fabulous, but that's not the word I use to describe it.  Why do you want to quit?  So colors are in.  I don't. 
[01:39:30]  Colors are in right now.  Unlike when Babe Ruth was playing baseball, colors obviously not in.  That was all we saw was black and white.  And it had nothing to do with the film or anything.  No.  People just wore that.  No.  We always had colors and everything were black and white.  Listen, wearing bright colors for men is very in right now.  Is that true, Chris, the gay man from Bopperston?  Yes, it is.  Bright colors are in right now.  I told you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  So you agree with the gay guy.  The gay guy concurred on you as far as fashion goes. 
[01:40:00]  There's nothing wrong with that.  Danny, do you know much about fashion?  No.  I wear horror movie t-shirts every day.  Danny's got the I-got-my-cake shirt from Creepshow.  It's fantastic.  It's a great shirt.  It's part of the Creepshow collection.  Yes, Danny's Creepshow collection.  Yeah.  Danny could just hang his shirts on the wall and then take them off, use them as art, and  then just take them off and wear.  Not a bad idea.  Yeah.  And Bobo's just staring at a picture of himself, right?  Yeah.  He totally couldn't get out of the chair. 
[01:40:30]  Eight minutes to go, and we did two straight hours, my friend.  And what does our gay friend want?  Oh, Chris from Bopperston.  Bopperston?  Yes.  Well, so I can get him into Fur Fright and be like a VIP or a keynote speaker because  I dated the guy who organized.  Is it a very gay event?  Yeah.  Pretty much everyone is gay.  Even the ladies are gay, too.  A lot of lesbians.  Oh, fuck, Sam.  This is like fucking nirvana for you, man.  Yeah, it's going to be great for you.  It is not.  This is the place to be for you.  I'm sure I would meet people.  What are you going to tell Jess that I have to do this for the show? 
[01:41:00]  Yes, you just told me I had to.  Yeah, you know.  Why'd you pick a girl with a name that could be a guy's name?  I didn't think of the name.  I thought of her as a human being.  Yeah, but when you're having sex and you go, oh, Jess, Jesse.  Jessica is what I say.  Jessica.  Can we play Jesse's girl for Sam today?  You don't need to play that.  See, because you're and she, so Jesse's girl.  Girl.  Well, no.  The girl would refer to you, Sam.  No, I understand, but it's a girl with a guy's name. 
[01:41:30]  I happen to this time, but it's not a guy's name.  Her name's Jessica.  Yeah.  Last girlfriend.  What's her name?  Bob?  No, Ashley.  Ashley is Ash from Ash from the Evil Dead.  His name is Ashley, by the way.  I guess so.  Yes, it is.  Well, fine, but absolutely.  So there's two girls with guy names.  You could have the guy name.  What about, I dated a girl named Christina, which is a girl's name. 
[01:42:00]  Chris.  But you don't call her Chris.  Chris.  Chris.  Chris.  See?  See?  See?  Chris from Barfiston.  Barfiston gay guy just answered you.  And we were just saying your last girlfriend's name three girlfriends ago.  But I never called her Chris.  Doesn't matter.  She got a guy's name.  I don't think so.  Travis, good call.  Keeping the song going 60 seconds past the fact.  He's terrible today, Travis. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, past.  I'm gay.  Past the realization that the bit wasn't working.  What is that?  I just blasted in over us talking.  What's that?  I'm gay.  Who is that?  I don't even know who that is.  Is that Travis?  No, that's Sam.  It's Sam.  I'm gay.  That doesn't even sound sort of okay.  Is that Jimmy?  It's like a robot thing.  I know it doesn't sound like you.  I think it's me.  It really is.  It's Sam.  But it's obviously poorly edited.  Hey, Travis, can you get the exclusive audio of Sam actually saying he doesn't want to work for us anymore? 
[01:43:00]  I don't want to work here.  No.  I wasn't talking about that.  It was right there.  Oh, damn.  Goodbye, then.  The exclusive audio.  Good fucking riddance.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't let the door hitch on your ass on the way out.  I'm not leaving.  Don't let the doorknob go up your ass on the way out.  I'm not leaving because...  Because we have to use that doorknob.  Doorknob.  I'm not leaving.  Hey, we missed...  We fucking lost Chris from Barfiston.  Because of Travis's faux pas.  Oh, Chris, call back because we want to know more about the furry convention, for real. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Fur Fright.  I don't know what that's about.  Apparently, now we've learned, though, it's a lot of gay people doing this.  But I want to hear about the gay events, and I want to hear if there's a lot of this sex going on.  Yeah, I want to know if there's dirty suits, dirty, like with the ass cut out or the dick cut out.  Like, do you walk around as a squirrel with your big balls actually hanging out like real squirrels have those giant balls?  Why do squirrels have giant balls?  They need those giant balls. 
[01:44:00]  I'm sure you study balls.  Yes.  Why do squirrels have big balls?  I don't know why squirrels have big balls.  Maybe something to do with their mating habits.  Is that on Yahoo Answers?  Why do squirrels have big balls?  I want to know.  Let's say hi to Kathy and PA.  Kathy.  Five minutes to go, and then we did two straight hours.  Let's go for three.  Oh, wow.  We could drag Joe DeRosa in here and go for the marathon, my friends.  Let's just do it.  We can do that in a second.  Kathy, what do you got? 
[01:44:30]  Kathy.  Hello.  Hi, Kathy.  When Sam was talking earlier about the bug in his hair from being in the park, he said,  um, just as my girl friend.  He said he emphasized on friend, not girl.  Why would you emphasize the friend part of girlfriend, Sam?  How do you say that?  It just said girlfriend.  See?  Girlfriend.  I hear it go up in the end.  My girlfriend.  Instead of girlfriend.  She's my broad.  She's a girl I'm banging.  Oh, does that sound so phony?  Because why would they make me talk like that? 
[01:45:00]  A man would.  No, it wouldn't.  Yes.  Men kind of say, hey, yeah, my broad.  Girlfriend.  Ash.  Sound tough, Sam.  What's that?  Sound like a tough guy.  Sound like a guy's guy.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's hear it.  Be a man's man.  What should I talk about?  See?  Chicks.  That proves you don't know.  Yeah.  You don't even know?  See?  You don't even know how to do it.  Talk about fashion again, you fruit.  You knew the difference between fabulous and whatever.  You know that bright colors are in?  How the fuck?  Who told you that?  How did you learn that? 
[01:45:30]  I looked at what the trends were.  I looked at what people are wearing and what is considered fashionable.  Did you ever look, Opie, at what people are really wearing in terms of, I mean,  if you see some stuff, it's like, all right.  Yeah, basic shit, but I wouldn't know what colors are in.  You wouldn't know a trend.  I didn't know bright colors, man.  Colors are the new black.  But black is black.  Oh, don't go back to a bad racial...  No, I don't mean the race.  I mean, because at one point, everybody was wearing black clothes.  Oh, right.  All right. 
[01:46:00]  And now they're more wearing bright colors.  I'm wearing black.  Oh, shit.  I'm so out of touch with the fashion world because I'm a heterosexual male.  There are plenty of heterosexual males who like to dress a certain way.  And, you know, suck a dick every so often.  That would make them not heterosexual.  Danny, someone has a feedback.  Take a look at sheep balls.  Dave is begging us to take a look at sheep balls.  Sheep balls?  We all have seen the picture of the squirrel with the big fucking hangers.  Of course.  But I got to see sheep balls now.  Hind legs.  Maybe you could go in a sheep costume. 
[01:46:30]  Costume.  Sorry.  Thank you.  You cut out where your balls are and just pull your nuts through and walk around.  And they would love it.  I know, but I don't think I would feel comfortable.  Sam, would you do that for us?  Oh, would they love it?  For fur fright?  I would really try to avoid it.  No, just have your balls hanging out.  No one knows it's you because you're in a fucking costume.  It's perfect.  What, you got a picture of sheep balls?  Sheep balls.  They rule.  They're giant.  Oh, those sheep.  Oh, ew, look at this with a big sheep asshole. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, god damn.  What's the yellow shit on it?  Oh, would you scrape that off and eat it?  No.  It's like yellow shit on its balls.  God damn.  I'll give $200 cash.  Bring back Pat Duffy.  He'll do that shit.  Yeah, he would.  Ew, look.  Chick is like cupping giant balls.  That's mule balls.  Those are mule balls.  And please, please get that horse pussy before we leave for a break. 
[01:47:30]  CokeLogic.  What's up, buddy?  Good evening.  I enjoy your tweets, you fucking alcoholic.  Yeah, I'm not going to say I have a problem, but it might be there.  I do enjoy them, though.  Very good tweeting by the CokeLogic man.  What do you got today?  I just want to ask Sam if he was decorating an apartment.  Would he go for comfy or fabulous?  Oh, very good question.  Comfy or fabulous?  I mean, if I'm decorating an apartment, you have to realize this is a place you're going to be all the time. 
[01:48:00]  You go for comfy.  Because fabulous, it's like maybe if you've got people coming over and you want to impress someone.  Dude.  Yeah.  What?  Just stop.  You blew it again.  All you had to say was I would go for comfy, but then you explained why fabulous could work.  He elaborates.  I'm saying that if you're having people over and you want to impress someone.  I'm going to help you here.  All right.  Well, then.  Yeah, comfy.  Haven't you been listening to me for the last hour?  I've been trying to help you here.  I'll tell you this, CokeLogic.  The answer is I would go for comfy, not but fabulous if.  I'll let the chick do the decorating, man. 
[01:48:30]  I don't know anything about that stuff.  He can't even sound.  He can't sound like a guy.  Decorating.  Yeah, right.  Maybe for chicks.  With dicks, right?  No, not with dicks.  Yeah, I heard it too.  Hey, CokeLogic.  Everyone wants to know what the next animation is going to be.  We're thinking Caveman.  I'm thinking that too.  That fucking thing.  Caveman was fun.  I hate you because now when we're in the middle of doing some of these bits, all I picture is a CokeLogic animation.  Yeah, fantastic. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, when I'm listening to the show, I'm like, oh, that'd be fucking perfect.  Yeah.  And where's the website for all the animations?  I haven't plugged in in a while.  Yeah, sure.  I'm putting them up on vimeo.com.  That's v-i-m-e-o dot com slash CokeLogic.  Perfect.  I recommend people go there and check out what CokeLogic's been up to.  Absolutely.  All right, brother.  How's Chicago?  It's fantastic.  White Sox or Cubs?  I never asked you that one.  I have to go with White Sox just because I'm a belt fighter. 
[01:49:30]  Now, I want to know a little more about Chicago.  Now, is White Sox the, like, if you're cool, you do White Sox?  What's the difference between a White Sox fan and a Cubs fan, generally speaking?  Generally speaking, it's if you're from the north side or south side.  It's pretty easy.  Oh, that's it?  It's like a border.  It's pretty much it.  I mean, they got all the hipsters up in Wrigleyville with their bars.  And, you know, it sounds cool, but then Cubs suck because, you know, Sox rule. 
[01:50:00]  I think we're going to make it to Chicago in the fall.  Never been.  I want to go.  Maybe CokeLogic could show me around if he's not too hungover.  I'll show you all the fantastic bars, you know.  Nice.  All right, brother.  Thanks.  All right.  Sorry to bring the show down.  You did fine.  Fabulous.  You actually did fine.  You know, at this point, we're just going for two hours without a commercial.  So who gives a shit if we have a few minutes of filler from CokeLogic?  No, you were terrific, though.  ZombieX, what's up? 
[01:50:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  I just want to say I've been listening to the show for a long time.  I've come in and watched your show plenty of times.  I've met Sam.  Yeah.  He's obviously gay.  What are you talking about?  Well.  Music.  No joke.  I'm not even joking with you.  My girl, she listens to the show.  And whenever Sam comes on, she goes, I can't listen to this gay guy.  Listen to his lisp.  That's a lisp that nobody talks about.  His voice is higher than anything.  The music he listens to, Lady Gaga. 
[01:51:00]  Check out Lady Gaga from Tanya.  From the way he dresses.  No man is up with fashion.  Sam.  They wear what they want to wear.  This guy is hitting it right on the head, Sam.  Well, maybe I want to wear something that people might stop and say, oh, look at him.  Sam.  What?  That's right.  All right.  You don't listen.  You don't listen.  You don't listen.  You don't listen.  You don't listen.  Some men would stop.  It's not men.  Women appreciate fashion.  You don't listen.  And by the way, I met your girl, dude.  And she's a good looking girl.  That's right.  And she's been wasting a little too much time with you.  And I think she was giving looks to me last time I seen her. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, damn.  Oh, yeah.  I bet she was.  You sound like a really, really, like, good looking guy.  You sound like a really smart guy, too.  I'm not a good looking guy.  I'm a straight guy.  Oh, yeah.  And my girlfriend just going, man, I'd like to find a straight guy who listens to the Opie  and Anthony show and calls in and sits there with his girlfriend.  Man, I can't listen to this gay guy.  Change the channel.  I don't want to listen anymore.  Better than watching wrestling.  Yeah, better than watching wrestling.  Fucking rolling around on a man.  What do you do with your free time?  What do I do with my free time? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  I bang your fucking girlfriend.  Oh, wow.  You went there, Sam.  You went there.  He fucking went all in.  Oh, he went there.  He's all in.  Oh, shit.  He's all in.  Do you call him?  Yeah, let's see what head you got.  What do you got?  You're gay, Sam.  Oh, damn.  And then he fucking raises you.  Oh, shit.  He might have all in.  He might have three aces.  What do you got, Sam?  How tall is my girlfriend?  Oh.  Exactly.  Sam, let the record show that he hung up. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Because he was scared.  Let the record show I did not hang up on him.  Exactly.  You do enjoy watching semi-nude men touch each other.  Listen.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You do enjoy watching semi-nude men touching each other on television, don't you?  Well, it's phrased strangely when you put it that way.  No, this is a yes or no question.  Well, in some contexts. 
[01:53:00]  Do you enjoy watching semi-nude men?  Semi?  That looks like a nude fucking ass.  That's Triple H.  He's not gay.  Why is Triple H?  Triple H has his pants.  Why does he have his ass?  His pants down.  He's a friend of ours.  What is he doing?  He's teaching the Spirit Squad a lesson.  Oh, is he?  Yes.  But that's his nude ass.  And who is that?  Is that HPK?  Yes.  It's Shawn Michaels shoving a Spirit Squad member's face into Triple H's asshole. 
[01:53:30]  Right into the crack of Triple H's ass.  I'm so glad we finally found another form of entertainment that's more gay than our show.  Thank God, finally.  WWE is not gay.  Sam, you enjoy this.  Yeah.  You enjoy watching men licking other men's assholes.  What makes MMA straight, then?  Because they're beating the living piss out of each other.  But there's more touching and holding and grappling in MMA than wrestling. 
[01:54:00]  I watched UFC 100.  There was a lot of bald heads on guys' faces.  They do it in bare feet.  Bare feet, man.  Is that the line?  Bare feet.  Well, you're not going to sleep with somebody who's wearing boots.  Yeah.  There's no sex with boots on.  Well, there was a wrestler that didn't wear shoes, right?  They have Superfly Jimmy Snuka.  We're not going to disgrace him.  Sam, why don't you try to explain your way out of that picture where it looks like the  Ultimate Warrior is giving Hulk Hogan a blowjob.  You tell me that's not what it looks like. 
[01:54:30]  It's not what it looks like.  We're looking at a picture of Hulk Hogan, and his face is showing nothing but ecstasy.  It's a cum shot face.  No, a pleasure.  That's agony.  That is a cum shot face.  You explain how this is not gay.  That's a picture from WrestleMania VI, one of the most classic matches of all time.  How the fuck do you know that?  It's Hogan Warrior.  Let's be real with each other.  Yeah, let's be real.  And that's a test of strength.  What about a show that you watch that might have a song that might have a song, albeit a 
[01:55:00]  little old, but might have a song that sounds like this?  It's a good song.  We all enjoy the song.  Now, let's just listen in a little bit.  Okay, let's do that.  Let's listen in and review.  He's an ass man.  Love him.  All right, love him.  I try to kick him.  I love to shove him.  Shove him.  Stick him.  Stick him.  See? 
[01:55:30]  Flaunt him.  I love to watch him.  Watch him.  I love to pick him.  Pick him.  And I'm gonna kick him.  Yeah.  Are you an ass man, Sam?  In some respects, certainly.  Certainly.  I gotta say, this is a good song.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like you're changing your tunes.  No.  Hey, Travis, why don't you turn the song up a little louder so you completely drown us out?  What, are you not getting sleep because you're a new daughter?  What the fuck happened?  You know what?  It sounds fine.  Trust me.  There's...  Oh! 
[01:56:00]  Sorry!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Why don't you just leave up and have Travis come?  No, no, no.  No, I want to explain something.  Do you?  I thought he was the silent part of it.  Let me explain why you're not going to the Winter Classic in Boston.  Why?  Uh-huh.  In Bofferson.  In Bofferson.  Things that...  Things do sound different in this studio than they do going out over the air.  When are we gonna fucking fix that?  Well, I don't know.  We've had a problem with that for how long we've been here.  So why did you look at your watch when you said, for how long we've been here? 
[01:56:30]  You mean the watch that I don't even have?  He doesn't have one.  I don't know.  I don't know why.  He just looked at his bare wrist.  He's getting a little nervous.  He really is.  It is a problem, and things will sound louder to you than they actually are, and things  will sound softer to you than they actually are.  What?  And it...  What?  You didn't hear that?  No, you're...  Bad joke.  You're either really irritating or your voice is really loud.  I can't figure out which one it is.  Because it's booming in my headphones.  Mars, fix that or you're fired.  Thank you.  Hey, Sam, by the way, I got to add someone else to the list of people that like your girl. 
[01:57:00]  Who?  Me.  Who's on the list already?  You.  Well, I mean, it's different.  You know.  Side piece is what she has labeled in your phone book as.  Side piece.  It's very uncomfortable for me.  I don't even know why you have her phone number.  What?  That is fucking weird.  Yeah.  I don't.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, you wanted it?  Yeah.  You know, don't give out her phone number.  Why?  Let me look up side piece.  And it's labeled as...  Can she go out with me?  No, she's taken.  Do you mind if I go out with your girlfriend? 
[01:57:30]  I would appreciate it if you did not do that.  There is side piece's number.  Which number?  It's labeled side piece.  Side piece.  Don't matter.  Damn, yo.  And what's Mars looking at over there?  Mars is photographic memory.  He just...  Mars, you want side piece's number?  Jotted that down.  All right.  So who's on the list already?  I'm obviously on the list.  Yeah.  Club Soda Kenny.  Is obviously...  Way high on the list.  He is infatuated.  He's in love.  Apparently that idiot who just called in a minute ago.  And you want to...  Don't even remember his name because that's how little I care about him. 
[01:58:00]  That idiot.  Idiot.  Kevin from Connecticut?  Yes, you're going to the Winter Classic with me and Danny.  Wow.  Not Travis.  Can I go too?  Well, I had three tickets and I figured I'd give it to Connecticut.  Kevin from Connecticut.  You want to know the last name?  Who else is on the list?  Brother Elmo.  Oh, shit.  Brother Elmo?  Oh, shit.  I was sitting outside FH Riley's last night.  Oh, hell no.  Boy.  And you came up and he said, man, I like that dress.  Oh, are those pictures?  What?  For real?  He did.  Oh, fix the monitor so I can see too. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, we got to move the monitor.  I want to look at Sam's girlfriend.  Why?  Why?  Wow.  Maybe she stops going to show events and stuff.  She is really, really cute.  After this outing of you on the show.  Oh, my God.  Look at the little pouty picture.  Go to the middle.  Go to the middle.  Oh, man.  God, Sam.  That is great.  I'm saying she's good looking.  Your chick is hot.  That's right.  And she likes me very much.  You are so fucking out of your league, man.  You are fucking.  It's a disgrace that she's with you.  Look at her. 
[01:59:00]  She loves me.  Love the Zah.  When you pick out her fashions.  No.  You pick out her clothes and stuff.  I mean, I've gotten her clothes before.  Does she get annoyed with you?  Never.  You're one of those guys that could get clothes for your chick.  Oh, look.  Is she wrapped up in a blanket?  Damn it.  Let me see the one where she's wrapped up in a blanket.  Oh, God.  Oh, look how cute that is.  She's very cute.  She's short.  She's small, too.  She's like five and a half feet tall.  I mean, five and a half.  Five and a half inch.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Why are you getting all flustered, Sam? 
[01:59:30]  I'm not getting flustered.  I just want to make sure you guys don't get out of line here.  We're not.  We're being very respectful.  I appreciate that.  To a girl that should not be with a gay gentleman such as yourself.  Well, I'm not gay.  And that's first and foremost.  Danny, if we go to nine o'clock without a break, we could go home, right?  Because then we have to make up commercial wise.  Yeah.  Yeah, then it's all got piled off.  They love it when you do it.  By the time I get home, I'll be listening to the end of the show.  It'll be all commercials.  We got a real live furry on the phone. 
[02:00:00]  His name is Aaron, and he lives in Buffalo.  Aaron from Buffalo.  Maybe that's what he dresses as.  Yeah, what do you dress as, Aaron?  A buffalo.  How's it going, gentlemen?  I actually dress as a human being.  I don't have a suit where I dress up like an animal.  Oh.  Well, you're a killjoy.  Well, it depends on where you go, because some of them can cost like $10,000.  It's kind of ridiculous.  Stop it.  No, I'm serious.  Why?  Because there are people who like to get most realistic looking things and get like all their 
[02:00:30]  little things cut out.  Aw.  Sorry, I'm just looking at the gist.  With a naughtiness.  You didn't say an aww?  Yeah.  All right.  Very cute.  We're going to send Sam to a fur friday in Waterbury, Connecticut.  I got to cut your phone call short, because the phones, no joke, are unbelievable.  We start with Jason in Carolina.  Jason.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that this is the first time I've ever felt positive about E-Rock,  so I just wanted to say something.  E-Rock, you're still a fat fucking pig.  Yes. 
[02:01:00]  What is that picture?  Nice.  That's me watching TV, and that's when Bruiser Brody was just a kitten.  He fell asleep.  On your ass.  Bruiser Brody's my cat.  I named him.  He's an ass cat.  Damn it.  Damn it.  What happened?  Let me say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  What's up, bu-bu-boys?  Hey, Charlie.  Hey, Charlie.  Sam, you and your foxy brown hairdo are gay.  Hey, look at the guys you've kissed. 
[02:01:30]  You had E-Rock's penis in your mouth.  I didn't have E-Rock's penis in my mouth.  I did not have E-Rock's penis in my mouth.  Then what are you calling?  Remember that?  You had a penis in your mouth.  Aw, what's the one all the way to the left?  Yeah, what's she doing there?  Are you still looking at that Jess picture?  I can't stop looking at him.  She's very good looking.  Yeah, why are you?  Look how cute.  She made me cookies.  And she bakes for me, too.  Why?  Because she loves me.  Chris.  Morning, bu-boys.  Guys, I want Mr. Roberts to admit it. 
[02:02:00]  I picked him up in my limo, and we did cocaine in the back, and he blew me.  And I'll take a polygraph to testify.  Where was this?  This was in Lower Manhattan.  Oh.  Oh, sir.  Sorry.  Oh, sir.  Fail.  Fail.  You were so close to a perfect call.  Yeah, there were two key things to your phone call you needed.  Gurney and crack cocaine for him.  Crack cocaine.  Powder cocaine for me.  And, of course, the location, sir, is Gurney. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Sorry.  Sorry.  So close to a perfect call.  Sorry.  Wow.  Look at that.  There's a picture of Jess leaning over and just looking at Danny seductively while ignoring Sam.  While ignoring Sam.  Look at Sam thinking that, you know, her and Jess are looking at the camera, and Jess couldn't be bothered.  That is a joke picture.  Looking so, like, infatuated.  Yeah.  It's totally into me.  That is a joke picture.  I fapped to this many times. 
[02:03:00]  Danny.  I fapped to this many times.  I will put on the record.  You fapped to it many times.  I've never heard that word before.  Jess is actually repulsed by Daniel Ross.  By Daniel Ross.  Not Daniel.  Wow.  For the record.  Yeah.  That's not true.  Yes, it is.  Why is she so into me?  Yeah, look at you.  Because it's a joke picture.  At Dan's wedding.  That's not a joke picture.  It's a joke.  Why wasn't I invited to Dan's wedding?  You know.  You know.  You know. 
[02:03:30]  But I've been nicer to everybody lately.  I should be getting more invites.  But this was a while ago.  Why am I doing all this work on myself, and still I don't get invites to nothing?  This was before.  What the fuck is that about?  I worked on myself.  Start inviting me to shit, fuckers.  You motherfuckers.  Let's go to Andrew in Brooklyn.  That's right.  It's the Andrew in Brooklyn.  Andrew.  Andrew, we've been going nonstop for two hours and 15 minutes.  That's right.  A minute, Sam.  You got fucked in the ass by Bobo's brother.  You got fucked in the ass by Bobo's brother. 
[02:04:00]  I did not have sex with Bobo's brother.  You're thinking of Bobo.  Bobo.  Oh, shit.  Andrew's saying you had sex with Bobo's brother.  Well, that's ridiculous.  Bobo's brother is a one-man type of guy.  Andrew, are you still there?  No, he did Frunkus.  There's nothing else after Frunkus.  I just wanted to ask him which space shuttle took off.  No.  Fuck.  Andrew.  Stop charting new bits.  We still want to hear Stairway to Heaven.  Exactly.  It's classic. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, we want the classics from you.  Should we break?  The only reason I want to break is because we've got to get Dave DeRose.  Dave DeRose is my fucking friend I grew up with.  Holy fuck.  I haven't thought about him in years.  Oh, my God.  Sam.  Sam.  Explain that picture.  Exhibit A right there.  I see you with a cock in your mouth.  That is you blowing E-Rock.  That's obviously not a real penis.  What?  You can see it's plastic.  Can I?  Yeah.  Look, it's shiny.  No, it's just wet from being in your mouth.  It's not wet at all.  It's plastic. 
[02:05:00]  It's Eric's penis that is moist because it was in your mouth.  It's wet.  Yeah, because it's in your mouth.  Look at your blowjob style.  Look at that upper lip.  I remember being told I was not good at blowjobs.  You're not.  Oh, my God.  By you guys.  Oh, my God.  Oh, well, Travis.  Travis just kind of, Travis got a hold of that one like he hooked a fucking, a big fish.  Again.  He just felt a nibble and then wham.  Oh, wow.  Hooked it.  That's another one.  I believe we'll be hearing that one to be used out of context. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, boy.  Out of context.  What's your context?  You just said.  Yeah.  You actually said that.  Yeah, but that's what you guys said when you saw that.  Travis, what do we have on Sam?  We got the exclusive audio that he said today.  What was that again?  Do you have it handy?  I don't want to work here.  Which is such a shame.  And that's not what I was talking about.  You gave us great radio today.  It's too bad this is your last day.  Oh, it's not my last day.  And we got this.  Man, I'd like to find a straight guy.  Oh.  Oh.  That's a rough one, Travis.  I know there's a terrible pull by Travis. 
[02:06:00]  What are you doing today?  Yeah.  What do you think is wrong with Travis today?  Well, I think his true skill level is being displayed today.  Travis is actually, he's good today.  Yeah.  He's blaming Eric for that one.  Oh, really?  Eric hasn't done anything.  Let's just leave him alone.  Exactly.  He hasn't done anything.  It's true.  Is he really blaming Eric for that one?  Apparently that was something that Eric cut and was like, here, I cut this.  No, he didn't. 
[02:06:30]  Did he?  Did he?  Yes, of course.  Eric is still the lump of shit we all know and remember.  All right.  But you are, look at your jaw, your fucking, you are sucking a cock right there.  Nope.  That is fake.  It's a fake thing.  And you're doing a Charles Bromson impression.  Yeah, you're not using teeth.  You're doing like, you're really fucking working that.  I don't know.  You are really trying your damnedest to give a good blowjob in that picture.  Well, here's the thing. 
[02:07:00]  If I'm going to do something, I'll be the best at it.  God damn.  Now, this is only a visual reference of what happened.  Now, I mean, what did it sound like when you were doing that?  Oh, that's right.  Because this is radio.  Yeah.  I don't know what it sounded like.  But I mean, I'm not saying that you gave it.  If you were going to put a penis in your mouth, maybe what would it sound like?  Patooey.  I don't like this.  That's what it would sound like, Danny Ross.  Patooey.  I don't like...  That's exactly what it would sound like.  But you'd have the dick in your mouth.  Yeah, but you would...  Not for long. 
[02:07:30]  Not if I had anything to do about it.  But why is it in there?  Maybe it was forced in.  I don't know.  I don't know the scenario we're setting up.  You instantly just went with that.  You had a dick in your mouth.  But I spit it out.  It doesn't matter once it's in.  I didn't like it.  What was the sound it made?  Patooey, I don't like this.  Is what it would sound like because I don't.  It's in.  It's in, though.  You can't have given a little bit of a blowjob.  The fucking dick was in your mouth.  How did he convince you to put it in your mouth?  He probably forced it, if anything, but it didn't happen. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  See?  Yeah, use that out of context.  How do you not tighten your lips up and not let the penis protrude into the lips?  What?  How are you not fighting off a penis in your mouth?  I did.  That's why I said Patooey.  No, it's already in.  Because he tried to put it, but then I spit it out.  And were you hoping for a better tasting penis?  No, I didn't want one at all.  Because you went Patooey.  I don't like the way this penis tastes.  I didn't want one at all.  Get me some syrup.  Get me a better tasting schlong. 
[02:08:30]  It's like waving off pitches, you.  With cocks.  Yeah, I don't want to throw the best ball.  Just show him enough and eventually he'll just nod.  And nod, and nod, and nod, and nod, and nod, and nod, until you get the creamy filling.  Whatever.  Can we take a break?  We went two hours and 20 minutes.  Yeah, we'll take a little break.  Thank you, Sam.  My pleasure, really.  And Bobo is still looking at a picture of himself.  Yes, he's looking at a picture of himself.  All right.  Staring at it like a lunatic.  And I got to apologize to Joe DeRosa. 
[02:09:00]  We told him to get here at 6.30.  I know.  It's now 8.20.  We've been jacking off in here without him.  And what were we going to play going on a break?  Oh, Ian Halperin was in with his Michael Jackson book thing.  Yeah.  Oh, I want to hear Cool Whip.  Oh, we still got it.  Let's just hear it.  Go to break with Cool Whip?  Yeah.  How long is this?  It's about like a minute and a half.  Oh, it's long?  All right.  Yeah, let's do that because that makes sense.  And then we'll do the Ian Halperin thing, how he tries to defend Canada.  The boys did a nice little production piece from our interview with Ian Halperin.  You're Cool Whip. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, Brian.  Oh, Meg, hey.  Hey, listen, I hope you're feeling all right about our little talk the other day.  You know, about us being just friends and all.  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  And, hey, look, I wanted to thank you for being so great to me.  So I baked your pie.  Oh, wow.  Hey, that looks delicious.  Wow, this is good.  What's in there?  Well, there's some apples and some cinnamon in my hair.  What?  It's not the right clip, by the way.  My hair is in the pie, Brian.  No?  What?  Oh, boy. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, that's the better.  Yeah, that's the clip.  Oh, Danny.  It was perfect.  Ooh, you got some pie, eh?  Can I have a piece?  Uh, sure.  Ooh, let me have some of that Cool Whip.  What'd you say?  You can't have a pie without Cool Whip.  Cool Whip?  Cool Whip, yeah.  You mean Cool Whip?  Yeah, Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  You're saying it weird.  Why are you putting so much emphasis on the H?  What are you talking about?  I'm just saying it.  Cool Whip.  You put Cool Whip on pie.  Pie tastes better with Cool Whip.  Say whip.  Whip.  Now say Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip. 
[02:10:30]  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  You're eating hair.  That's it.  That's great, man.  All right, we're going to get Joe DeRose in here.  Oh, by the way, I tweeted that really gay wrestling picture, so you can check that out.  I'm asking the question, is that the gayest wrestling picture ever?  Yeah.  It's not.  You find me one that's gayer than that one.  Hulk Hogan looking like he's enjoying a blowjob.  It's a test of strength.  Ultimate warrior.  Sam's an ass man.  Asshole.  Damn it.  I'm girls.  Sam's an asshole. 
[02:11:00]  Damn it.  What?  Why didn't you just call me that?  Because you won't jump out the fucking window?  He's a dick, man.  No.  He loves to suck them.  No.  He loves to blow them.  He loves to lick them.  He loves to taste them.  Because Sam's a dick, man.  Why don't you keep your opinions to yourself if that's what you're going to be saying?  Oh, really?  Why don't you jump out the window?  I don't want to because I'll die.  But you'll put a dick in your mouth until you go patooey.  But I'll do patooey right away. 
[02:11:30]  That's the twist on that.  Aw.  Aw.  Break time.  Chop, chop.  Travis, do you think you can do that right today?  Thank you.  Go to break for us.  I'm doing a lot of things right today.  Travis sucks.  Artistic.  What are you talking about?  You suck.  We're going to break.  All right.  We made Joe DeRosa wait for two hours, and I have to apologize publicly for that.  It's all right.  We're in one of those weird places today.  We're just silly.  And he came in, though, full of piss and vinegar and just making everybody laugh.  I'm laughing my ass off at what Joe DeRosa has been talking about. 
[02:12:00]  We're definitely going to get into some of that.  Holy shit.  We decided, fuck, enough with Michael Jackson in the news.  We're just fucking off today.  That's it.  This is a fuck-off day.  Yeah.  Just fucking around.  Just fucking around.  And Joe, I'm trying to get the energy back that we had during the break, so help me out  here.  Don't worry about it.  We got Mary Carey coming in.  Yeah, Mary Carey's coming in.  She does our show from time to time.  And Steve comes in, of course. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  And wants to dole out the latest DVD.  Thank you for that, Steve.  For Mary Carey.  What is she promoting today?  Well, she's promoting a wonderful DVD called Celebrity Porn Hab.  With Dr. Screw.  See, because Dr. Drew and Slimey Rehab, yes.  It is the worst fucking title I have ever heard for a porn. 
[02:13:00]  I'm sorry, because she's going to be good.  But they just don't even try.  And then I'm reading her bio, and it said she's also the star of Lick My Balls.  I mean, talk about just mailing it in.  They just tapped out.  Why are we trying to be clever?  We've had enough.  Just call it Lick My Balls.  And then we, Danny pulls up the cover, and it's just her licking a guy's balls.  On the cover, we were howling.  The fact that it's like fucking, I just pictured the meeting, the meeting as they're going like, 
[02:13:30]  all right, what do we got?  We got Celebrity Porn Hab.  That wasn't good.  I even got to realize, you know, Rehab, it's Celebrity Rehab.  Just to put porn where re is, doesn't even rhyme.  It's not funny.  It makes no sense.  It's shoehorned in.  Now, we have this on the movie.  What do you want to call it?  Do we have any play awards?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Raise your hand.  All right, look.  All right, fuck it.  Just call it Lick My Balls. 
[02:14:00]  What's she doing?  Licking his balls?  Call it Lick My Balls.  Perfect.  She's kind of got the Rolling Stones logo as part of the Lick My Balls title.  Yes, there's a tongue, a cartoony tongue wrapped around the L in Lick of Lick My Balls.  Is that the Rolling Stones logo or the Twizzlers?  Mascot.  Yeah.  Do you think she had to pitch that?  Mary, what do you got for us?  I have an idea of her film.  What is it?  It's called Lick My Balls.  What are you doing? 
[02:14:30]  I lick a guy's balls.  We like it.  It's simple.  I like it.  But there's something more to it.  She's featured in such porn movie franchises.  So Lick My Balls is a franchise.  There's a Lick My Balls 2?  I guess so.  Or Lick My 2 Balls.  I didn't see that until just now.  What do you mean it's a franchise?  A franchise is supposed to be a specialty, like ass eaters.  What porno don't they lick the guy's balls?  Exactly.  Guys, we got an idea for a franchise. 
[02:15:00]  It's really unique.  It's called Guys That Come.  We're going to run with this.  That's going to be our hook, is the guy is going to come in every scene.  What about we pull our money together and get one of these franchises?  Franchises, like it's a McDonald's.  We can open right next to the Starbucks.  That is great.  Coffee and Lick My Balls on the same block.  Come on.  Celebrity porn hab.  They couldn't think of one dirty word that rhymes with rehab or something.  But I got to say, I can't think of one. 
[02:15:30]  I'm kind of at a loss.  Reem.  Cream hab.  Cream hab.  Reem hab.  There's a few.  Reem hab.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Celebrity reem hab has the R-E in it.  And then, you know, you can have her getting reamed.  It beats the shit out of porn hab.  Maybe her ass isn't up to a good reaming.  And Dr. Screw.  I mean, Dr. Screw is so hack.  It rhymes, but it's hacky. 
[02:16:00]  But it's so hacky.  It's hacky.  Oh, I get it.  Dr. Drew.  But I can't think of anything better right now.  I'm running my fucking mouth like I've got all these great ideas right now.  Well, it's not your job, though.  People have jobs for this, and they come up with Lick My Balls.  I mean, come on.  Give me a fucking break.  She's going to be in in about a half hour.  We're going to go deep with her.  Oh, yeah.  Real deep.  Yeah.  We've got a bunch of little things we've got to get to.  And then Joe just handed me a fucking disc. 
[02:16:30]  It's you going after a heckler at a comedy club.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  We've got something else.  Oh, no.  Here's the title.  Oh, no.  There's a Negro in my mom.  And there's a kid, you know, supposedly a kid.  He's about 30, and he's making the Macaulay Culkin Home Alone face because he just walked  in, and his mom is sitting on the largest black dick ever. 
[02:17:00]  Or, and the kid is wearing a Mom Likes Me Best shirt.  The plot of that movie should be the black guy trying to fuck the mom, but he's got to  get to her in the house, and the kid is doing all the Home Alone shit to the black  dad.  Home Alone stuff to try to keep him away.  Yeah, he's like electrocuting him.  Yeah, throwing paint cans at him.  And meanwhile, the word Negro is spelt out in bone font.  They are bones.  This is, there is so much going on on that cover. 
[02:17:30]  And it's purple.  And it's purple.  And it's purple, yes, yes.  You know.  You got to think the kid fucks his mom at the end of this porno.  After the situation is taken care of.  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if he joined in.  Yeah.  There's a series called.  There's another one?  Oh, no.  There's a Negro in my daughter.  And meanwhile, now there's a big black guy fucking the white girl on a purple couch.  And dad has his hands on his hips, and he looks like he just got home from the office.  He's like, oh, no. 
[02:18:00]  And the daughter is smiling at him.  Just looking up like, hi, dad, look.  I have a Negro in me.  And he's got to look like she, you know, came home late.  Yeah.  Broke her curfew.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I like, look at this.  I like at the top, it says, Grip and Cram Johnsons, like it's Sid and Marty Croft present.  Grip and Cram Johnsons.  Come on.  What's that, Daniel? 
[02:18:30]  It's just like a, no, I lost my mind.  Oh, shit.  That happened.  Oh, shit.  Cram Johnson.  It sounds like a baseball player from the 30s.  Cram Johnson steps up to the plate.  Ladies and gentlemen, Cram Johnson.  Cram Johnson.  There's a Negro with his daughter.  Pitch hitting.  Cram Johnson.  He played with Pumpsy Green.  Cram Johnson was on his name.  Jesus Christ.  I remember Cram Johnson. 
[02:19:00]  I once got an autograph from Cram Johnson.  Oh, is that fan-fucking-tastic?  Speaking of baseball.  Yes.  Nice segue.  Whatever.  Speaking of Negroes in my daughter.  It's fuck off Friday.  I think we might have to start a new theme.  This is way better than trying to make the fucking news interesting for everybody.  Hey, Danny, what's Major League Baseball player arrested and crying like a girl?  Oh, yeah.  This is great. 
[02:19:30]  I know it's getting a little old.  I think it was Matt Bush.  Matt Bush got arrested.  Matt Bush puts out some good movies, too.  Matt Bush.  Look, Mike Bush.  Graham Johnson and Matt Bush.  Such clever titles as I fucked a Mexican in the ass.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, he was getting arrested for Dewey, and he was not pleased.  And he showed his displeasure. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, I suppose he was very upset by the whole thing.  He's been called one of the biggest busts in baseball history.  Tonight, he is in trouble again.  Matt Bush, a former number one draft pick of the San Diego Padres, has pleaded not guilty  to a handful of charges.  After cops say they suspect he was driving drunk when he backed into another car in a parking  lot.  It's his second arrest this year.  It's all caught on tape, too.  And we warn you, apparently there is crying in baseball.  Among the charges here, resisting arrest, driving under the influence, and vandalism. 
[02:20:30]  Bush is currently facing assault charges, stemming from an incident back in February.  Bush got a $3 million signing bonus in 2004, but he has never, ever played a major league  game.  Wow.  His lawyer says the pitcher is currently in rehab. 
[02:21:00]  Aw.  What the fuck?  Wait.  They had a hog tie him.  Did you guys hear something in the background there?  A little bit.  You did hear that?  There was something going on.  I want to turn up the volume here.  Hold on a minute.  He's been called one of the biggest busts in baseball history.  Tonight, he is in trouble again.  Matt Bush, a former number one draft pick of the San Diego Padres, has pleaded not guilty  to a handful of charges after cops say they suspect he was driving drunk when he backed  into another car in a parking lot.  It's his second arrest this year. 
[02:21:30]  It's all caught on tape, too.  And we warn you, apparently there is crying in baseball.  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  It's better.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Among the charges here, resisting arrest, driving under the influence and vandalism,  Bush is currently facing assault charges, stemming from an incident back in February.  Bush got a $3 million signing bonus in 2004, but he has never, ever played a major league 
[02:22:00]  game.  His lawyer says the pitcher is currently in rehab.  The itcher.  Ah!  Well, there we go.  Hey, uh, hold on.  Before we move on from porn titles, John in Connecticut has something.  John?  What's going on, guys?  Hi, John.  They wanted to get your guys' take on the best porno title ever.  Jackie Treehorn presents Gutter Balls.  Gutter Balls?  Gutter Balls.  That's from the Big Lebowski, right? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I think another one was Log Jammin'.  Yeah, Log Jammin'.  The funniest title I ever heard was, I can't remember, like, which girls they put in the  series.  Excuse me.  But the series title was the girl's name followed by this sentence.  So just for example, it would say, Mary Carey is a fucking fuck pig.  Ah, you know what you're getting.  Classic.  I have a list here of some porn movie names, if you'd like them. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, let's say.  Just a few, in alphabetical order.  A Few Hard Men.  American Hair Pie.  Tale of Two Titties.  Come on.  This one doesn't even...  They take a classic.  This one doesn't even rhyme.  Anus the Menace.  I like that one.  Vicarious George.  Black Cock Down.  Black Cock Down!  That's pretty great.  They take a fucking American tragedy and turn it into a dick joke movie. 
[02:23:30]  And I've seen screenshots, so I know this is a real one, but it's Edward Penishands.  Very nice.  Is it just the guy with penis for his hands?  It sure is.  Yeah.  Phil Bill.  Come on.  Max Pedroom.  That's great.  Beaver on Golden Blonde.  Yeah, that was a classic.  That was a classic.  I always wanted to make a James Bond one called Cock to Pussy.  Cock to Pussy. 
[02:24:00]  I always thought that was very clever, but...  But no one flew with that one?  I don't have the juice.  I want to pitch Cock to Pussy.  Sorry, kid.  We're all tied up with Lick My Balls.  We just put out Lick My Balls.  If you were here a day sooner, we could have called it that.  No one cares.  Your title, you're too artsy.  Bring it down for the people.  Yeah.  You ever see the Booyah?  No, it's the Booyah.  Booyah is fucking great.  Booyah rules.  Booyah is great.  Danny will find you in a second.  Rob, what do you got as we find the Booyah?

Oh, sweet.  Yeah.  But first, the Booyah for Joe because he's never seen this.  I don't think I have.  This is called the Booyah.  Booyah.  Of course.  It's loading up.  Get it? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I get it.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  It's hilarious.  There you go.  Booyah.  I have seen that when I was here.  Oh, right.  You guys showed me that here before.  Look at this.  Look how proud we are of it.  I know.  It's like the guy pulls his black nuts out of this chick's white asshole.  I love the pop noise it makes, too.  And then goes, Booyah.

Oh, they added filthy in there.  Filthy fucking fuck pig.  Is that the sequel?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  That is a great title. 
[02:26:00]  And the tagline under it is, enjoy this giant helping of Gia's spread open sphincter.  Sphincter.  I'll fuck anywhere.  The funniest description I ever saw in a porno movie was, I was on Score VOD, and I saw a  porno on there where it was guys in KKK outfits fucking black chicks.  And I was like, I gotta see what this is.  And I read the description and it said, this, you know, this sizzler features Klansman fucking 
[02:26:30]  black chicks, but you're probably into that, aren't you?  You sick, perverted fuck.  That was on the box.  Yeah.  It actually called you out.  That's great.  You probably like that, don't you?  You disgusting piece of shit.  That's how they got away with it.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  It was, uh, I enjoyed it.  Penis hands.  Oh, is that him?  One penis.  It's hard to see.  Yeah, you can see the big, fat cock hand.  He's got his penis hands.  We could get more into that when Mary Carey comes in. 
[02:27:00]  We could do porn titles all day long.  But, uh, we gotta get the Bobo thing on, too.  Yeah, Bobo, too.  We got a new little thing happening with Bobo that's quite...  And Joe DeRosa apparently had a one-week-long relationship.  Oh, yeah.  That ended in a fight in a shoe store.  I'll tell you all about it.  Actually, after you...  Well, after you hear this clip, it'll all make much more sense.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Let's do that, then.  But I had food poisoning in this clip, and the lady heckled me, and that's how this unfolds.  The Laugh House in Philly.  Yeah.  God, you and your buddy, uh, Bill Burr, have problems in Philly, huh? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Philly's a rough town, I'll tell you.  Hey.  How you guys doing back there?  Good?  Good.  Good.  I'm glad you're having fun.  I am feeling worse by the second, people, but I trudge on.  I think I'm fucking food poisoning right now.  That's bad, right?  What are the sips...  Oh, that girl just thinks I'm not funny.  Really?  Wait, what'd she say?  Because it's hard to hear?  Obviously, she's heckling.  She just said something like, you're not funny, or... 
[02:28:00]  Is that, you know, you're still not funny, or something like that.  I don't quite remember.  What are the sips...  Oh, that girl just thinks I'm not funny.  Really?  Oh, I'm all beside myself.  All right.  It's...  It's...  Who heckled me?  I just want to know.  Which one heckled me?  Which one of you heckled me?  Here's what you don't get.  How dare you 
[02:28:30]  attempt in any way  to coach me  in stand-up comedy?  I don't teach you  how to buy hideous,  ugly fucking earrings  that are clearly fake and cheap.  But you think people  will respect you for them?  The what?  Get a new...  How about you?  Get the fuck out.  How about that?  What the fuck  if you don't want to be a fan of mine? 
[02:29:00]  It's not funny,  yet you're sitting here  and listening to it.  Who's the fucking retard  in this scenario?  Good.  Skip the about to leave.  Skip the about to  and just fucking leave.  How about that?  How about take the shortcut  right to leave?  Take it out there.  You can drink it out there.  There's a lobby.  Enjoy it outside.  There isn't somebody  performing their fucking art  to disturb you  from your drink  that turns you into a cunt  out comes the cunt. 
[02:29:30]  That fucking bothers me.  Like, I'm not joking.  I really am, like, sweating.  I have a fucking fever.  I feel terrible.  I'm trying my best  and everybody's having  a pretty good time.  And you merciless  fucking bitch,  you can't...  You can't fucking  look past that.  You can't hear all that. 
[02:30:00]  You can't hear all that.  You can't hear all that.  That's because you're an idiot.  That's all applause  because you're an idiot.  They all like me.  They don't like you.  You see?  Leave.  What?  All right.  Everybody, she said,  I'm numb.  All right, so...  By the way, sir, 
[02:30:30]  I have no problem  with you whatsoever.  And even your husband's  laughing at you now.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's great.  What?  Don't...  Did you guys just dare  groan on her side?  I heard that,  you turncoat motherfuckers. 
[02:31:00]  Crowds are so fucking fickle.  Like, you can nail somebody  20 times and they're like,  yeah!  And then the person's like,  you stink!  Nobody else gets that  kind of fucking fickleness.  Like a boxer,  like, if he knocks the guy out  and then the guy stands up  and he's like,  beg it, you know,  I'm going to go to the...  That's my problem.  I just start turning on everybody. 
[02:31:30]  Jesus, Joe.  Fuck it.  That's fucking great.  Nice.  Holy shit.  You gave her a talking to.  It wasn't too mean  considering I had food poisoning, right?  Or was it really?  It was good.  You're going to ask me?  I loved it.  It was clever.  That's...  So, like I was saying,  oh, what was it?  Two weeks ago I was in here  with you on that Monday  or whatever.  I literally had a full...  It was Friday.  A Friday?  I had a...  Monday or Friday.  I had a full relationship  since... 
[02:32:00]  In the time I left that day.  It started that night.  Beginning, middle,  and the holding in two weeks.  Yeah, I hooked up with this girl  and we were having a great time  and she started sleeping over at my house  and she stayed over like...  You know when they stay over  like every night for like a week  and you feel like you've been dating  for six months  because they're always there  and I'm taking her out  and buying her food and shit  and just,  oh, you're so beautiful.  I miss you so much  when you're not here.  You know, really just...  You've only known her for 48 hours.  Yeah, just sliding right into it 
[02:32:30]  with my lonely miserableness, right?  All in.  And then we go down to fucking Shoe Mania  for the 50% off sale.  So you're now going to Shoe Mania with her.  Baby, you want to help me?  You ran the gamut of a relationship  because two fucking weeks.  Because you know that's what she's into.  Shoes.  She wasn't even into it.  She was like,  you want to go where?  I was like,  I want to go to Shoe Mania.  They have a 50% off sale.  I need some shoes.  She's like,  what are you a fucking...  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You know? 
[02:33:00]  And I'm like,  come on, baby.  I really was the chick, you know?  And I bring her down  and it's crowded  and everybody's being an asshole.  And the lady behind the counter  was such a fucking bitch  when I was paying for my shoes  and I had a goddamn meltdown  at the fucking counter.  Oh, shit.  I Shoe Mania.  Oh, no.  So you exposed something  she hadn't seen.  Yeah.  She sees sweet guy.  Exactly.  Lovey-dovey guy.  And then you fucking turn  into that monster  that we just heard on stage.  Fuck. 
[02:33:30]  She's looking like,  who is this man?  We walked out of Shoe Mania  and she's like,  yeah, so...  I kind of had to walk away from that.  Oh, damn.  Like, it was kind of weird.  And the first thing out of my mouth,  I go,  oh, yeah,  you had a fucking meltdowns  are cute  when I'm talking about them on stage,  but then you see it in real life  and it's not so fucking cute anymore, right?  I'm like,  where do you think  all that shit comes from?  You know,  and she was like,  yeah, it's really not.  But she hung in there  for one more day.  One day. 
[02:34:00]  And she's like,  I'm gonna,  let's try to work it out.  And then she came over  the other night  at like 3 a.m.  and we're laying in bed  and she goes,  I just don't feel  that you should ever see  that side of somebody  a week into it.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it was rough, man.  You had a complete relationship  in a week.  Whole, whole relationship.  Ran the gamut.  Yeah.  From where I'm attracted to you  to infatuation 
[02:34:30]  to stay over  and coddle you  to you have shit  you need to work out.  You have problems.  On Wednesday,  you're meeting her parents.  Shoe mania.  And it ends on shoe mania.  But I think I got,  I think I got the last laugh  because I'm pretty sure  in that night  when she dumped me,  she still slept over  because I tried to be  the bigger man  and let her stay.  She's like,  you want me to leave?  I'm like,  no, baby, stay.  I don't give a shit.  I'm just going to  turn over into the fetal position  and cry for a little while.  Silently.  Yeah, exactly.  Just sob myself to sleep. 
[02:35:00]  But I'm pretty sure  I farted on her  around 7 a.m.  that morning.  I let one rip on her.  That's good.  As you're shaking uncontrollably  because you're crying silently.  Yeah.  Joe, why are you shaking?  Nothing.  It's cold in here.  Shut up.  Damn.  Holy shit, man.  That's brutal.  You nailed it, though.  What's that?  What do you mean?  Where you feel like  you know the person  for like six months  and it's been three days.  Dude, I get... 
[02:35:30]  But that's when you know  you're into something  a little different.  Well, no,  it doesn't even mean  that you're into  something different.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's just  that's the way  it always goes.  Yeah, I just...  I do that all the time.  I get way...  My buddy called me out on it  with this chick.  He goes,  dude, he goes,  you skipped the whole  courting process.  He's like,  that's when you fall in love  and it's funny.  He's like,  you jump right into  complete intimacy.  Let's share everything. 
[02:36:00]  That's your loneliness.  You just couldn't help yourself.  I can't.  I go right to,  hey, this is the real me.  You want to walk away?  Walk away now.  We're fucking just lunatic.  I'm being honest here.  Oh, God.  I hung out with Burr too much.  Yeah.  You kind of sounded  like him right there.  Yeah, just learned  how to fucking,  you know,  you just air it all out  all the fucking time.  I've been that guy  so many times, though. 
[02:36:30]  You have to it.  Like that?  I am terrible.  Just all in right away?  I've been so bad  over the years  with that  where I just,  you know,  it's just based  in complete insecurity.  Oh, yeah.  It's like,  don't, you know,  don't leave.  Don't leave me.  Dude.  This is great.  The times  that I have turned in  where the fucking  whop in me  has come out  100% when I'm drunk  and I'm literally  in the street going,  go ahead. 
[02:37:00]  Walk away.  Walk away.  I don't need you.  You know,  just.  But usually  when you go to that,  you go that route,  they come back.  But in your case,  they're still walking.  And it's usually  after a long time.  You don't fucking do that.  You don't do the walk away.  After four days.  Early in a relationship.  I hit it a hot  three weeks in.  Tops.  Tops.  Tops three weeks.  Arms spread out  in the middle of the street.  Come on. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Let everybody out  of here think it's me.  Walk away.  You're weak.  Yeah.  Dude,  just fucking.  Just fucking.  So you're single again.  Yeah,  I'm single.  After three weeks.  Wow,  man.  Two this time.  How does it feel  to be single again?  Oh,  it's brutal.  I'm so excited.  I have a glimmer  of hope in me  that Mary Carey  will somehow  be some fetish  she wants to fill.  Should we do Mary Carey  after the break  or continue and do  a little of this  Bobo shit  that is amazing? 
[02:38:00]  Bobo stuff.  Should we try a little  Bobo before break?  What are we doing?  Where are we at  schedule wise?  I don't know how to do it.  I've not been,  I'm not aware  that Mary Carey's here yet  so you guys can die.  All right.  Where's Sam?  Get Sam.  Because he's got to  explain the Bobo thing.  I just want to ask you  just about like,  obviously now  she was living there  or something  but you live alone?  Yeah,  I live alone.  Yeah.  What do you do  when you're at home  and you're alone?  Oh,  dude,  just,  it's,  you know what I did yesterday? 
[02:38:30]  It's embarrassing  and so sad.  I was home all day  and I stayed in  like the night before  if I know I'm going  to be on here  in advance  I won't take spots  so I can try to stay in  and sleep and shit.  Right,  yeah.  So I didn't take any spots  last night  and I went out  and I literally bought  $20 worth of Chinese food.  This is fucking hilarious actually.  I call the Chinese place  and I order,  I order two orders  of fried chicken wings,  white rice,  two egg rolls  and an order of spare ribs,  right?  And the lady goes,  $20  and I go, 
[02:39:00]  and I,  the cheap side of me  comes on  and I'm like,  that sounds more,  wait,  what?  That's not how much  it should be  and she goes,  and I'm like,  because I'm sitting there  going,  you fucking pig,  you're going to spend  $20 on Chinese food?  So I go,  never mind.  You know what?  I'll just pick it up.  I'll just come in  and pick it up  because I didn't want  to commit to the delivery.  So then I leave my house  to go get something  at the supermarket  and I'm like,  fuck,  I want that Chinese food.  So I walk in  and I'm too embarrassed  that I argued about the money.  So I go, 
[02:39:30]  hey buddy,  let me get two orders  of fried chicken wings,  two egg rolls,  that's it.  And he's like,  all right.  And I go,  I'll be back in 10 minutes  and I go across the supermarket  buy lettuce  and I come back  and I go,  you know what?  let me add some spare ribs  to that,  some white rice.  And the guy's like,  okay.  And the lady goes,  did you call?  Oh no.  And I go,  no,  I didn't know.  Did I call?  No,  I didn't call.  She goes,  because somebody called  and ordered the same exact thing  20 minutes ago.  Do you want theirs? 
[02:40:00]  And I go,  as long as you're not  screwing that guy up,  I'll take his order.  And she's like,  you didn't call?  You're sure?  And I'm like,  I didn't,  I didn't call,  but you know what?  You might not want to give me that.  I literally was lying to the board  where I believed  that I was another guy out there  that was like coming in  to pick up this food.  Someone's going to be mad,  but that's you.  So pathetic.  You know,  it would have been really good  if when she rang it up  and said 20 bucks,  you went,  seems a little expensive.  It was fucking 16 
[02:40:30]  when I picked it up  in the store.  Fucking bitch.  I know.  So you were right.  Yeah,  exactly.  But that's,  I do shit like that.  I just sit and just,  I ate so much Chinese  when I had a stomach ache.  Like I felt sick all night from it.  Yeah.  That,  and I just lay.  I find myself,  I find myself walking around.  I mill about  and then I do like,  I do things like,  I stand by the edge of my pool,  put my hands on my hips  and just look  and nod my head a little  and then I walk away. 
[02:41:00]  Like I just,  I am lost.  You're just hoping  something's going on  in your empty house somewhere.  That's,  that's,  that's healthy.  Like I'm lost  unless there's people  at my house.  I'm fucking lost.  But you're really looking  for something that's going on.  But yeah,  yeah.  In your house.  Yeah.  Knowing there's no one there  except you.  Like you know how hard it is to,  I got,  I have,  I have,  I have a movie theater  in my house.  Do you know how hard it is  to sit in a movie theater  by yourself watching a movie  where you're just kind of, 
[02:41:30]  I'm just watching the,  there's so,  so many times I'll just be like,  here come the lonely songs again.  You know,  I'm just going to watch it upstairs  on the TV upstairs.  Meanwhile,  it's an 11 foot wide screen  that I could watch anything  in full fucking movie theater.  But I'm just sitting  in the little reclining chair  going,  I'm all alone  in a movie theater  in my house.  It's a little pathetic.  You know what's hilarious  about that?  When you go to a real movie theater  alone,  it's sort of gentlemanly. 
[02:42:00]  And like,  I'm taking in a film by myself.  But when you actually  build a theater  in your house  and you just have to use it alone.  And you're just alone in it.  Oh,  God said.  I'm going to go up  to the living room  and that way I can just  walk into my office  and look at my desk  and go,  nod my head  and then go upstairs maybe.  You're like a,  you're like a Sims character.  Yeah,  I am.  Exactly like a Sims character  that no one comes to visit.  Oh,  that's great, 
[02:42:30]  man.  Holy shit.  Opie,  what did you used to do?  I mean,  I'm just jealous  you have a pool  and shit to look at.  I mean,  I have a one bedroom.  I walk.  Oh,  no,  when I was in that world,  I just wandered the earth.  What do you mean?  Like just around.  I was lucky  when I went through  my lonely couple of years,  I just wandered.  I didn't have a job.  See,  that's where it's different.  I didn't have to go home to nothing.  So I just wandered around. 
[02:43:00]  But you were doing this show  and you were single,  weren't you?  Have you been dating your wife  for that long?  Me and the wife  have been together  for almost five years.  Jesus.  Yeah,  no shit.  Wow.  Is that amazing?  That went fast.  So your lonely phase.  She's finally out of college.  Was your lonely phase  when you guys were between shows?  Oh,  yeah,  because,  you know,  my last relationship  thought it was a perfect time  to like realize  that our relationship  wasn't too well.  Even though we both knew 
[02:43:30]  it was horrendous  for the two years  leading up to it,  but it was a perfect time  to,  you know,  don't you hate  to start discussing things  as,  you know,  the career was completely shot?  Don't you fucking hate  thinking of the girls  you didn't fuck  because you were  in a relationship  that you then broke up?  Like,  it's like,  oh my God,  I could have,  like,  and who cares  because I'm broken up now,  so it didn't matter.  The end product is there.  There's no more relationship.  It's like,  God damn,  I passed up that.  All the times 
[02:44:00]  you didn't cheat.  This fucking,  there's one in particular  I remember,  this blonde  who literally  was the only  diehard fan  I ever had  where she showed up  at every,  every time I go to Philly  she just shows up  and she's hot  and she's wasted  and she tries to get me  to hang out every time  and every time  I've been dating a girl  and I can't  and every time  I've broken up with a girl  and been like,  fucking moron,  like,  I should just bang  this fucking girl.  Actually,  maybe I should,  I should keep my one fan. 
[02:44:30]  Keep your one fan.  Yeah,  you'll ruin that now too.  You're gonna fuck  that relationship up?  Yeah.  I,  I,  I think I,  yeah,  I fucked around a little bit,  not fucking,  but,  uh,  screwed around with the,  the,  one of those Kalua girls,  um,  up in Massachusetts  when I was married.  That's our best story ever.  When I was married.  We both were,  but you gotta set it up.  We were in Boston  doing radio.  Yeah.  And,  uh,  both of our relationships  were so,  so at best.  Oh my God.  But we were just distracted  by trying to become radio stars 
[02:45:00]  and all that shit.  But you had a career  to take care of.  And we went to a,  uh,  a bar night.  We were doing bar gigs,  you know.  And these Kalua girls.  Anthony appearing tonight  in a club Cadillac.  These Kalua girls  couldn't have been more  than 18,  19,  and they had the Kalua girls  outfits on.  Hot as shit.  Yeah.  And,  and now,  now continue,  and I'm sorry.  I just needed to set up there.  They fucking really  were into us.  They really were into us.  And I'm just like,  motherfucker,  I'm fucking married.  And,  and this sucks  because I really want to fucking do. 
[02:45:30]  So I got a few drinks in me  and pulled one aside.  The one with the braces.  Oh,  that's evil.  I love it.  It was fantastic.  So me and this chick  are fucking,  you know,  making out and stuff.  And,  and I'm just like,  I completely was just forgot  about my marriage.  I'm like,  fuck this.  You forgot about being married.  I forgot.  Completely forgot.  And then you did them.  Yeah.  I fucking just,  cause I just know  the position he was in at the time.  Uh,  yeah.  Then,  then, 
[02:46:00]  then the fucking dose of reality  comes in that,  no,  you are,  uh,  married.  And when did that dose of reality  come in?  Was when the girls asked us  to go,  listen to this,  Joe,  listen to this,  to go fucking skinny dipping with them.  thank you.  They're like three girls  and just us.  Just me and it.  Going,  going,  you guys.  Pretty damn good.  We're going to go down by the lake  and,  and do some skinny dipping.  You want to go?  And there's me and Opie.  We look at each other  and we then go,  no,  we gotta go.  No,  no,  no,  we can't.  We gotta go.  And then, 
[02:46:30]  and I think back  and go,  oh my God,  I don't care  what,  what the fuck.  Yeah.  Dude,  that's literally like the episode  of Seinfeld  when he's like,  the roommate's into it.  She wants to have the trees up in it.  I'm not going to do it.  What do you mean  you're not going to do it?  When George freaks out.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Yeah.  I don't understand.  I know.  But I think,  I think the problem was  that it was skinny dipping  because how do you explain that  when you come home with like, 
[02:47:00]  now you're wet with lake water,  with Massachusetts lake water on you.  Explain what,  dude,  you had that dirty water  to wipe her pussy smell  off of your body.  You're right in the middle  of a Charles in Charge episode  and you fucking just,  God.  It was,  yeah,  it's one of my biggest regrets  in life  is that I didn't have sex  with that girl  because I was married.  I have,  I don't know  what the fuck I was thinking.  I get into these funks 
[02:47:30]  when like I'll go on the road  and sometimes I'll,  you know,  I'm into like,  yeah,  fucking chicks  and let's have a good time.  But then I get into  these depression funks  where I'm like,  I can't bang these girls  on the road.  It makes me feel,  oh,  what am I doing with my life?  What am I doing with my life?  But I was down in,  or out in Ohio with Burr  and we met this Puerto Rican chick  and he's like,  there was this,  she's one of the dumbest  fucking girls  I've ever met in my life.  Love it. 
[02:48:00]  This fucking bar rolls, man.  I'm like,  great,  you know,  so I'm talking to her.  I end up making out with her.  She's got a friend with her  and her friend drives me  back to the condo  and this chick is like,  let me walk you upstairs,  wink, wink.  She walks me up,  we're making out on the couch.  She's like,  I gotta go.  And I'm like,  all right,  so I walk her to the door.  We get to the door,  she starts making out with me again.  She starts unbutting my pants  and giving me a hand job  and she goes,  come on.  And she's like,  basically,  let's go fuck on the couch. 
[02:48:30]  And I was like,  no.  You know when that feeling  overcomes you of like,  I just,  I get really freaked out  because I'm like,  this chick is drunk.  I don't know her.  God for fucking bid,  she says I raped her  or some shit.  That does come into your mind  sometimes.  Yeah,  and I was just like,  nah.  And then of course,  after the whole fact,  she was my spacing me  and being like,  how are you?  I want to see you,  but she's like,  works on the road  and I'll never have a chance  to fuck her ever again. 
[02:49:00]  She was so hot.  Just a fucking,  a little regret there.  Total,  dude,  just it was a freebie.  Yeah,  you threw it away.  Yeah,  I mean,  God knows,  I'd probably,  you know,  she's willing to bang a guy out  like me on a couch  while her friend's got  the car running.  She's probably,  God knows,  she's got herpes  or whatever.  That relationship  could have lasted a month though,  Joe.  Yeah,  you could have  had a long-term relationship.  Yeah,  yeah.  I would have been screaming  out the door of the condo 
[02:49:30]  as she was walking away.  Go ahead,  leave!  Oh yeah,  you want to fucking leave?  That's great.  This Bobo stuff  is worth playing  before we get Mary Carey in here.  There's too much going on today,  man.  Bobo.  We should be doing  two different shows.  Joe DeRosa,  of course,  he's,  what do you think?  I'm at the Cap City Comedy Club  in Austin,  Texas.  Not this weekend,  next weekend.  It's like the 20,  the weekend of the 24th.  I'm actually there  that whole week,  the Tuesday the 21st 
[02:50:00]  through Saturday the 25th  and then I have my own show,  which I talked about last time,  Indignation.  The next one's  Tuesday,  August 11th,  which is a long,  far ways away,  but the first one was awesome.  I heard it was good.  Please come out.  I heard good things about it.  Cool.  Joe DeRosa is awesome.  Thanks.  Sam,  Bobo,  what do we got?  Well,  he was leaving  voicemails for Christina  when we last left him.  You know,  we talked to him last week.  Now,  Christina's his girlfriend.  She doesn't know this,  but in Bobo's eyes,  he's all in 
[02:50:30]  and this is his girlfriend.  He says,  I love you and everything.  they're in love with each other.  If you ask Bobo,  they're very much deeply  in love with each other.  Yeah.  Very committed relationship.  However,  she is not returning  his phone calls.  Oh,  no.  But,  lucky for Bobo,  this does not deter  the voicemails.  Really?  So,  he was calling her  all week long  and we basically,  we found out  that on Saturday  or Saturday and Sunday  he was calling her  during the weekend.  So,  Danny,  Travis,  and I decided  that that would mean 
[02:51:00]  that we should call Bobo  every day  from the office.  We've been calling Bobo  every day.  Yeah,  and at first  it was just a very like,  let's just,  you know,  we were just messing around.  So,  we don't have all the  prank phone calls on tape.  Okay.  Like,  in the beginning,  we just like dialed Bobo's number  without any real plan  and Danny just started shouting,  stay away from my fucking girlfriend.  Shouting isn't even the word.  Like,  you know,  if you're going to do something like that,  you have to go all in,  right?  Yeah,  yeah.  So,  I'm like screaming,  like I'm like,  I'm banging the desk. 
[02:51:30]  I'm just like,  why the fuck are you calling my girlfriend?  Why the fuck are you calling?  And like,  what I found out later on  was like the entire floor stopped  and was like,  we had the door of our office shut  and they still could hear this.  And down the hall,  they were like,  dude,  what's going on?  So,  they're convinced that someone,  you're really pissed at somebody out there.  I just,  I had to stop,  so I'm sorry,  extra.  Oh,  yeah,  just texting her saying hi.  That's all.  Yeah,  there's a little,  there's a little contact between,  uh,  yeah,  just,  you know,  a little text.  Bobo's girlfriend.  That's it.  I will take you to a Mets game 
[02:52:00]  and,  uh,  we will then go to the,  yeah,  I like the other one.  We learned,  we learned Bobo,  like when he has to talk about,  like uncomfortable stuff,  his voice gets real hot.  His voice gets high.  He makes two little fists  and shakes him.  Yeah.  He,  uh,  I didn't know,  I never saw what he looked like  or I didn't remember at least  and he,  he was coming in  and he was fucking with E-Rock.  He was, 
[02:52:30]  Bobo.  Yeah,  E-Rock,  why did you,  why did you buy Troy breakfast  and not me,  E-Rock?  And he kept doing that  and E-Rock's going,  I fucking hate this fucking mother.  And I go,  I go,  who the fuck is this guy?  He got working for the show.  He's a fucking moron.  And he goes,  that's,  that's Bobo.  And I go,  oh,  Jesus Christ,  that's Bobo.  All right.  So E-Rock,  E-Rock paid for somebody's breakfast  and not mine.  So somehow Bobo got the idea  that he should constantly  walk into E-Rock's office  asking how come he's buying breakfast.  We're going to get Bobo on  a little later  because we're going to play these, 
[02:53:00]  then we're going to get Mary Carrie in  and then we'll do a little Bobo.  But should we start,  start with the voicemails  that Bobo is leaving for Christina?  Yeah,  start with the voicemails.  All right.  So here's one of many.  That's fantastic.  Remember,  Bobo is convinced  they're going out.  Christina,  I mean,  you know,  is like no fucking way.  But she's trying to be  a little politer than that.  Yeah,  she's,  she's got a big heart.  Oh,  Mary's not here?  No.  You know,  if she's late,  then fuck it.  For real,  fuck it.  She could lick my balls. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah,  I'm panicking to try to squeeze her in  and she's late,  fuck her.  Now we try to squeeze her in.  Here's Bobo calling Christina.  Saturday,  July 11th  at 12,  27 a.m.  So this is  a booty call.  Wait a minute.  This is Friday at midnight.  Holy shit.  And Bobo is,  is calling Christina.  Now,  he does,  though,  have a very good reason  for wanting to talk to her.  Like,  what he's doing  is definitely like topical 
[02:54:00]  and something that would  definitely require a phone call.  It couldn't wait.  Exactly.  Yeah,  okay.  Precisely.  Saturday,  July 11th  at 12,  27 a.m.  Hello,  Christina,  it's me,  Bobo.  I just want to know  how everything's going.  I'm just watching  the season two of Lost.  And I know  I've probably seen it  a million times,  but damn,  that show gets better.  New season takes forever  for the new season.  But once I know  how everything's going,  we'll hear from you  during the weekend.  Hope you have a good weekend.  Love you. 
[02:54:30]  So season two of Lost  on DVD.  Because you can't wait  for the new season  to come out.  Right,  it's Friday.  So you went way back.  12.30 a.m.  I wanted to see  what you're doing.  Yeah.  I love you.  Saturday,  12.25 a.m.  This is creepy.  I think this next voicemail  is another one  from the weekend.  Okay.  Before Danny Travis  and I caught wind  of the situation.  How great is that? 
[02:55:00]  Jesus.  Hello,  Christina,  it's me,  Bobo.  Just wanted to know  where we've been going.  You can call me back  as soon as you get the chance.  Bye.  Bye.  Love you.  To love you  is pretty pathetic.  I just texted her.  I said,  hi.  She goes,  how's it going?  I go,  good.  Just talking about you  and Bobo.  She goes,  oh yeah,  all good things,  I hope.  I go,  what could be bad?  Love you.  What are you doing? 
[02:55:30]  Call me back  or I'll fucking kill you.  Bobo's going to kill me.  I'm a little scared.  All right.  All right.  I see what you guys did here.  Okay.  So the third Bobo voicemail  to Christina is Sam.  Right.  So yeah,  we heard now,  Danny Travis and I  heard these two voicemails.  Sure.  Yeah.  So we decided it's time  to start calling Bobo regularly.  Now we start calling him  every day. 
[02:56:00]  We call him every single day  this week after the show  multiple times.  We also around Tuesday  or Wednesday  started calling him  at five o'clock  in the morning  every day.  Oh shit.  So basically  he started calling everybody.  He also called Garrett.  Everybody's phone number  who he had at Sirius,  he started calling  and panicking  because he didn't know  at first  what was going on.  He thought  it might be you  that were yelling at him  and pissed off.  Why would I call him?  Because Christina  don't think of him. 
[02:56:30]  Your girlfriend.  Yeah,  because he's messing  with your girlfriend.  Yeah.  So this is Bobo's  first voicemail  to Christina  after receiving  all these phone calls.  Nice.  Monday,  July 13th  at 11 0 7 a.m.  Hello Christina,  it's me Bobo.  Could you find out  what the heck  is going on here though?  I got a phone call  but I'm not sure  if it's Danny  or Anthony.  It was someone  that sounded  pissed off at me  for some reason  and I'm quite not sure 
[02:57:00]  why  or were they  trying to prank me  or was it  some sick prank  they were pulling on me?  Let me know.  He also has a tendency  of trailing off.  Because I think  he wanted to say  I love you there  and then realize  maybe it's not appropriate.  He's like  Did you get these voicemails  from the movie  Happiness?  I think this last voicemail 
[02:57:30]  is later on this week  after receiving  we literally called this guy  at least 15 to 20 times  this week.  Sometimes we would just call  and just we'd put it  on speaker every time  we would just dial his number  and just wait  and see how long  he'll say hello  before he hangs up.  I would just make armpit farts  into the speaker  phone  I think there was  one point  where we just  we put it  as a hip hop song  called Birthday Sex  and we just played  Birthday Sex  because he'll just 
[02:58:00]  sit there and listen  and he'll destroy  this world.  Hello Christina  it's me Bobo  can you try to figure out  what the heck  is going on here  because I seem  to be getting  prank phone calls  by Danny  freaking every  every time  around the same time  the 11 o'clock hour  every single time  I'm not sure  if it's him  trying to imitate  I know it's him  probably I'm trying  to imitate Anthony  but could you figure  out what the heck  is going on here  I'll see you on Friday  love you 
[02:58:30]  oh my god  oh my god  you can't love her  are we getting  both of them in today  we can't get Christina  in  why  because her  immediate  because last week  Steve got permission  from her boss's boss  right  so her immediate boss  this week  said she could not  come in  because there was  not a proper person  to substitute for her  the company's got to  look at the bigger issue  this is great radio  for us  oh yeah  get someone to do 
[02:59:00]  her stupid job  yeah  it's a little fishy  she said there was  somebody to replace her  like there was last week  it's the same  someone's playing a power play  with us  it's weird  I don't know  something's going on  that guy's gonna have  a major problem  fuck this  fuck this  fuck this  basically after like  five prank phone calls  yeah  I said  oh shit  I have to start  recording these  because we were just  doing it for our own  amusement  I realized  wait a minute 
[02:59:30]  maybe I can bring  this to the show  exactly  so I just grabbed  my you know  we tried to bring  everything to the show  Sam  yes  I just tried to  grab my little  I grabbed my little  flash recorder  and just started  putting the phone  on speaker  and just recording  okay  so I think this one  by this point  he kind of has  figured out  that it's Danny  okay  but  yeah  why you calling  my girlfriend  what are you  talking about  I'm with her  think it's fucking  funny  you calling my 
[03:00:00]  bitch  I'm not  I'm with her  Danny  what are you  talking about  you think it's  fucking funny  motherfucker  you think it's  funny motherfucker  imagine that  amplified by like  a hundred  and now  that was like  after I knew  that like  I had freaked  out the entire  floor  so I had to  tone it down  but I was  like the first  few calls  I was screaming  at the top  of my lungs  and then we  just started  having to think  of creative  ways to just  ruin his world  so like  I think this  next one 
[03:00:30]  we have  we've been  trying to figure  out how to  get this song  on the air  for a long  time  it's by a  rap artist  named Chuggo  Chuggo  yes  Travis Danny  and me  love Chuggo  the song  is called  come on  fucking  guy  so  we call  Bobo  and just  left  Chuggo  playing  hello  hello  hello  hello  hello  throw your hands in the sky  come on  fucking guy  on my way to the horn in the sky 
[03:01:00]  my brothers in the canyon  won't get out till last July  come on fucking guy  the people are shit  that's how I feel  I'll smash your fucking hand  that's how I feel  that's what I do  that's what I do  yeah what is this all about 
[03:01:30]  he probably was scared out of his fucking mind there  because he didn't know  he thought this was Danny pranking him  but the things we were just doing  were so  there was no method to it  it was unpredictable  insanity  sometimes nothing would happen  like we would just call Bobo  and just see how many times  he would say hello  we would call him 
[03:02:00]  at 5 10 a.m.  just not say anything  I love you  I love you  and finally you had intern David  call Bobo  well intern David you'll see  is written in quotations  because  that was actually Danny  doing intern David  poorly  yeah really  hello  hey Bobo it's David  what are you doing here David  what's going on David  that's what  I mean  what's going on Bobo  hi you suck  oh you did huh

[03:04:30]  that he was just  staring at in front  of him  and then one of the  interns told him to  give himself a  motivational speech  so he was talking  to a picture of  himself  I got tired of  hearing him talk  so now he's  staring at a picture  of David Beckham  modeling  tighty whitey  underpants  should we bring  him in  you want to  I'll go grab him  we really should  can you open up  the fucking  drapes to  it  god damn man  it's just brutal  that's brutal  dude it's  that was  Jesus Christ

[03:13:00]  I don't know  she dresses like a prostitute  my uncle Ray's girlfriend  that's not nice  yeah  but now  so you don't have any money  how much is a room at the Queens motor in  I don't know how much it is  but you don't have it  we'll give you the money  yeah  if you get to the point  where you're taking her to the Queens motor in  yeah  we'll hook you up with the cash  what is it  $30 an hour  I also need the burger and the beer at Donovan's  right right  because this was a whole big date  there's a burger and beer at Donovan's  believe me 
[03:13:30]  I'm telling you  you can't  you can't pass up a burger and a beer at Donovan's  I forgot  I'm a ghost  I forgot about that  Joe  yeah  yeah sure  you go ahead and speak  ongoing thing  I'm a lot  thank you  Joe  yes sir  so for the first date  check this out  yeah  you think you got game  Boba wants to bring Christina  that hot piece of ass that works here  for a really large oversized burger and a few beers  because girls eat a lot  down at Donovan's  down at Donovan's  yeah  it's a happening place 
[03:14:00]  sounds like a great place  and where  Queens  it's in Woodside Queens  okay  it's a happening place  okay  um  you know  because girls love pigging out on the first date  when they barely know you  why don't you take her to the old country buffet  right  and then  no but these are freaking good burgers  they serve there  and then he's going to move on to the Queens Motor Inn  which we have a picture of on the door  because we're obsessed with the Queens Motor Inn  that's the Queens Motor Inn  yeah that's it alright  I know it  Bobo the only burger on a first date is a fur burger my friend  yeah  well  well yeah 
[03:14:30]  there'll be that  and there'll also be a fur burger  but I don't freaking know what she looks like  the fucking  that  the Queens Motor Inn  looks like  the emergency room entrance  in an  Oneonta hospital  like  it just looks like  a horrible institution  that looks like  the only people coming out of it  are being shot at  in a chase  yeah  well I don't know about that  but my uncle  my uncle's heard  my uncle's heard noise  when he  he's had to deliver stuff  to  to those maids  that clean up the hotel rooms 
[03:15:00]  yeah  he's heard noise  he's heard noise  like what kind of noise  no  like the sound of effing  going on in the rooms  is that the motel  from Sunshine Cleaners  I'm talking  I'm talking about  loud effing  I'm talking about  business transactions  with prostitutes  going on in that place  wow  those are some strong  allegations  he has seen  escorts walk  into that building  how does he know  they're escorts  why are you doing this  to your uncle  he can tell 
[03:15:30]  by the way they look  because they're coming  often with different guys  now  this is a lovely hotel  after you pay  Frank Whaley  for a room  and actually  my uncle's boss  is named Jerry  how much is it  to stay there  no concept of a joke  that's what I love  Bobo  although he's funny  is that one of the escorts  walking in  oh Jesus Christ  is that Bobo  he's scoping the place out  Bobo  and then tell Joe 
[03:16:00]  what you want to do  with the Queen's Motor  and after you get her in  no after I get in  maybe I'll let her  make the move  I think it's only right  if I'm losing my virginity  and if the broad  has experience  the broad  you shouldn't be calling  anyone a broad  if you're a virgin  well when I'm doing it  with her  Bobo  I'm going to give you a tip  alright  when you go to an establishment  like this  you don't let the broad  make the move  this is the kind of place  where you just start  masturbating in the corner  and hope she goes with it 
[03:16:30]  but he said  he's going to do  some of that  that's a good pointer man  he said he's going to do  some pussy diving  yeah that's right  that's right  I don't know  did I start with  going pussy diving  or let her go down on me  wow what a choice  there's no other choice  like this not happening  is there a third option  is there a third option  well then he's going to 
[03:17:00]  get into  no no  the other option  is just taking place  the other option  is just taking place  at her house  oh now wait a minute  maybe it's a  you know her place  yeah I think that'd be  a better choice  than the Queen's Motoring  giving her the home field  advantage though  yeah but I think  it'd be a better choice  than the Queen's Motoring  yeah why is that  I don't know  a gutter would be  a better choice  no because I'm sure  she's got a much better  place than the Queen's Motoring  I bet you 100  and plus that  I've seen rooms  at the Queen's Motoring 
[03:17:30]  because one time  I had to go to the bathroom  my uncle asked me  to deliver something  to him  because he could not  leave his job  he said  he called me  and asked me  he said  I need pain medication  right now  he injured himself  on the job  oh yeah  yeah  he needs pain  through the window  and jack it off  I don't know  he injured himself  I think it sounded  like this  I broke my knee man  I broke my knee man  he needs pain medicine 
[03:18:00]  so he probably  made Bubba go up  to East Harlem  no no no  I just went  to the Queen's Motoring  it's in Queen's Boulevard  it's in Woodside  I just walked  to the Q18 bus  and took the Q18 there  fucking joke out  he doesn't care  he doesn't care  that was funny though  forget it  it's over  at least he approved  I bet you  100 to 1  somewhere in that  fucking place  there's a sign  that says  don't piss  in the elevator  please  please stop  urinating 
[03:18:30]  in the stairwell  that looks like  a fucking housing project  I can't get over  how shitty this place looks  well the Queen's Motor Inn  is a pretty cool place  if you listen to  the Laszlo show  this past Saturday  Wayne who is a  co-host on the Laszlo show  talked about his days  at the Queen's Motor Inn  really  when he would stay there  for 3-4 days  at a time  freebasing  Jesus Christ almighty  dude  I gotta hear about this  I was out at a block party  last week  I was too busy  at a block party  listening to Laszlo's show  drinking a couple of beers 
[03:19:00]  with my friend  around the corner  oh yeah  now where was  Christine  where was she  during this  I don't know  all I keep getting  was that stupid  answering machine  oh boy  I don't like talking  to answering machines  when I call  customer service  anywhere  I want to speak  to somebody  with a pulse  you do like talking  I mean you said  I love you  like 4 or 5 times  to a machine  you told the machine  that you loved it  yeah but I'm not  usually good  with answering machines 
[03:19:30]  no huh  no  how do you  you haven't been  out with her  on a date  right  yeah  but so how  are you jumping  into I love you  already when you  say goodbye  on the phone  I've talked to her  and gotten to know  her a little bit  so you know her  enough to know  that you are  in love  yeah I've talked  to her  she might be  a Yankee fan  but I have no  problem with  Yankee fans  alright  we share the  same damn  city with them 
[03:20:00]  so that  justifies you  saying I love you  yeah  and then I've  talked to her  a little better  she's got a good  sense of humor  I asked her  some of her  favorite comedians  she's mentioned  guys that you  guys have on  the show a lot  oh yeah  yeah I was  talking to her  about Jimmy  I've talked to her  about Bill Burr  she loves the  Jim Brewer  show  that was  freaking  what about  Jada Reza  I haven't  asked her  about her  yet  I noticed  there's only  one problem 
[03:20:30]  I have  with her  twitter  what's that  one of her  twitter  people she's  following  I saw  Howard TV  on her  twitter  oh  oh no  if I hear  she's took  off her top  on a Howard  Sturd show  I might have  to email  Howard Sturd  pictures of  my own junk  you should do  it  that bombed  Jesus Christ  almighty  I swear  I'm actually  going to do  that  I'm actually 
[03:21:00]  going to  take a picture  of my own  junk  Joe would you  like to see  his junk  your furniture  yeah  no no no  I ain't  going to do  that  I'd look at  his junk  yeah we'd  look at  your junk  if he took  it out  no no no  no no  no no  it's very  hairy  alright  you know  what though  Bobo  I think  we're on  to something  if you're  going to  enter into  a date  with Christina  I think  we need  to take  a look  at your  junk  and give  you some  suggestions  because there's  new fucking  styles out there  I might have to  groom it up a little bit  Joe's up on the latest  styles  I know one 
[03:21:30]  I would try  to do  but for obvious  reasons  after I've scored  with her once  I'll shave it  scored  the curtains  just immediately  closed  Bobo  make believe  it's a doctor's  office  a quick little  dropping of the  pants  Joe DeRose  will take a  look at what  you got  and then we'll  suggest  a hairstyle  this is why  I hate  seeing a  urologist  this is why  I've always  hated having  urinary system  problems  growing up  you had  urinary system  problems  I've mentioned 
[03:22:00]  it a lot  of times  you got me  too  you probably  had urinary  problems  from sleeping  at the  queen's  motor  inn  too much  I was born  with a condition  called hypospadias  what's that  it's urinary  system problems  that sucks  Bobo  it means  having trouble  peeing  do you ever  have any  surgeries or  anything  48 of them  48  because there  was problems  where they  had to do  the operations  in stages  where they  had to  repair  I don't  know  I ain't 
[03:22:30]  a doctor  I ain't  a doctor  what I  do know  is that  my mom  knows about  the medical  condition  better than  I do  did you  go to  Dr.  Screw  no  I went to  a guy  by the name  of Dr.  Kevin Burbage  at New  Presbyterian  Hospital  it's now  known as  New York  Presbyterian  hey Bobo  don't  mention  any names  don't mention  any doctor  names  if you want  to trash  your uncle 
[03:23:00]  who the fuck  cares  but some  doctor  I won't  mention  names  but I'll  mention  it's now  known as  New York  Presbyterian  like I said  we'll just  keep any  details  away  I just  know  the  freaking  annoy me  and  because  of this  there was  actually  a lot  of problems  where my  pee hole  kept closing  up  your  pee hole  or your  you got a  narrow urethra  this just  in  we have  a programming  change  for 202  uninformed 
[03:23:30]  has been  cancelled  the Bobo  show  will be  taking  its place  I'll take  that  that's fair  and what  day is  this going  to be  on  what  happens  when your  pee hole  closes  put the  earring  back in  it  it ends  up getting  smaller  and it's  more difficult  to pee  Bobo  I can't  be any  more direct  than this  show me  your cock  right now  come on  come on  help me out  we were  big day  that was a  mind trick  it could 
[03:24:00]  be quick  just show  Joe  no homo  keep making  that noise  while you do  it  see what I  mean  see what I  mean  why I'm  embarrassed  about this  that is a  wookie  you have  Chewbacca  with a  fucking  with an  elephant  trunk  well very  tiny one  but  I don't  know  I always  thought of  it  as bin  laden's  beard 
[03:24:30]  it's like  bin laden  eating a  cocktail  frank  wait a minute  we just  saw  I can't  even  describe  that  the best  we just  witnessed  the best  visual  for radio  ever  him  holding  his  pants  down  and just  going  see why  I'm  embarrassing  the thing  that is  a penis  that has  been  operated  on  many  times  I've 
[03:25:00]  had so  many  operations  and you  know the  worst part  about  being  operated  on  going to  the  bathroom  after  they've  removed  the  catheter  you have  an idea  how burning  that burning  feeling you  get when you  go to the  bathroom  after they've  removed  it  yeah  I've  had that  yeah but  I don't  think you've  ever had  an operation  on it  no no  thank god  you're lucky  you've been  born with the  cock of a 
[03:25:30]  black man  wow  so I've  heard  well thank you  Bobo  so I've  heard  that's what I've  heard  he just means  it's brown  yeah  I think I  heard  it would  make the  it's what the  iron she claimed  he had  but he doesn't  really have  because he's  because he's  old ball  bag  oh he is  wow he remembers  he's like  Rayman  with his shirt  he really is  uh  Jesus Christ  so much  has passed  out  so  him saying  see why  I'm embarrassed 
[03:26:00]  as he's  wow  that was great  I can't even  do that justice  how fucking  funny that was  uh Joe  you saw his  package  now you gotta  give him advice  because he's  got this big  thing hopefully  with Christina  this weekend  you know Bobo  I gotta be  honest man  you got  there's a lot  of hair  but it's an  evenly spread  bush  I didn't think  it looked that  bad  you have the  same hair  in your pubic  area as you  do on your  balls  yeah  like the whole  area is just  covered in  hair 
[03:26:30]  it's like an  overgrown  fucking yard  so it kind of  didn't bother me  for that matter  if it was a  little  if it was  thin in one  area  it was patchy  or something  then I would  have said  you gotta  trim it up  but I kinda  it's fucking  even dude  it's even  it looks like  it looked like  when William Hurt  comes out of the  tank and altered  stains  does Christina  like Harry Cox  yeah  that's what I  wanna know  who knows  of course  that's what you  wanna know  you might not 
[03:27:00]  wanna ask that  on the first date  you want me to  text her and  find out  yeah  you ask her  better you  than me  alright  there we go  I'm gonna text her  why can't we get her  on the show  I just pictured  it really that  important for her  to answer calls  for another show  right now  what'd she do  she board ops  she just  come on  she does what  Travis does  except without  by the way  by the way  I meant to ask  I was looking  at the stress  factory schedule  how come  Jim Brewer 
[03:27:30]  doesn't have a  date book  for the stress  factory  I'd like to go  see him live  but when is he  gonna be in  studio finally  cause every time  I listen  it's always  pre-recorded  and sometimes  they don't  take calls  why  what do you  need  no  I wanted  to call  the show  that's one  of my  favorite  comedians  from your  NAW  days  yeah  he's had  some freaking  hilarious  moments  on the show  I think  you're just  saying that  because  Christine said  she likes  the show  no  no 
[03:28:00]  I knew  that before  no  no  it isn't  that  I've  known  that  before  ask  one of  my mom's  friends  about that  alright  I will  how do I  do that  how do I  go about  doing that  one of  these days  I'll bring  her in  studio  oh  I'll tell  you  she's an  interesting  character  why is  that  well  you talk  to her  and you'll  see why  alright  give me  an example  of something  interesting  well she  seems like  she's always 
[03:28:30]  hammered  my mom's  friend  Antoinette  alright  no names  no other  names  I'm not  gonna give  a last  name  but  she's got  some stories  to tell  I can tell  you that  yeah  I'm not  gonna spoil  the surprise  I'll let  her do  the talking  I actually  wanted  I've been  so long  she never  contacted me  in advance  she's wanted  to be a guest  on the David  and Bobo  show  oh  she's wanted  to be  when she  heard the  audio 
[03:29:00]  of me  she downloaded  that show  of me  ranking on  Stalker  Patty  and she  said  she wants  to be  in that  seat  and just  me  ranking  on her  not holding  any punch  not holding  back any  punches  alright  how about  Sam will  play the  part of  Antoinette  and you  do a  no hold  hard  well you gotta  talk like  you've drank  a lot  there's trouble  Bobo  this is better  for Danny  Danny  can you play  the part  of Antoinette  you gotta 
[03:29:30]  talk like  you've drank  and smoked  a lot  and smoked  pot  and she's  Italian  hold on  we gotta  communicate  from Christina  who's not  alive in the  studio  Bobo  this could  be trouble  she goes  no hair  down there  she doesn't  like it  but is he  growing a  mustache  she goes  preferably  handlebar  I'm not  kidding  look  it's right  here  is the  handlebar  a little  bit longer 
[03:30:00]  the ends  gotta grow  and then  you gotta  twirl them  we're gonna  make you  into a stud  give us  a couple  more weeks  you gotta  work on  the handlebar  she's not  gonna be able  to resist  you  but the  problem  now is  she says  no hair  down there  she doesn't  like hair  down there  so now  what  now what  if I could  figure out  how to  shave it  without  cutting  myself  well  you don't  use a  ray  maybe you  could use  like a  tweezer  like an  electric  razor  roll the  whole thing  in and then  maybe we  could shape  it for  you next  Friday  what  shape  what  yes of 
[03:30:30]  course  well  if you  could  tell them  tell them  the looks  coming back  I would  prefer a  chick shave  the cock  the cock  yeah  other than  myself  I would  prefer  a chick  what would you like her to shave it with  well whatever she prefers using  electric razor  manual razor  mach 3  turbo  how about if she uses 
[03:31:00]  tweezers  yeah or waxing  really gets rid of it  no no  that would be so painful  on your balls  yeah  it would be  Mary Carey's movie  wax my balls  yeah  Mary Carey's later said  I have a shaved pussy  it's a  brilliant title  it's a franchise  as we said earlier  but  you know something  she said she doesn't like hair  yeah well  so now you're instantly  gonna be  yeah but I'm not comfortable  shaving  but what if 
[03:31:30]  look  I don't care about what you're  comfortable with  what if  it comes to the point  where you're with her  you're alone  it's go time  and you pull the pants down  and she goes  oh  well if that's the case  I'll shave it there  well on the spot  during the fucking  magic moment  you can't shave  as you're ready to have sex  well I'll shave it right before  oh boy  and the magic moment happens  and then what  right before the magic moment happens  magic moment happens  but you can't  because the magic moment  that's why they call it 
[03:32:00]  a magic moment  right  you don't know when it's happening  what the hell it is  if the date goes well  it's this  it's that  oh  I guess I could always try  shaving it myself  but I don't  I'm not sure what's the  best one to use  because I just got an electric  an M80  I got an electric razor  but it's freaking  I don't want to  I don't want to get a  cock smell  on an electric razor  well perhaps  you could wash  first  you could shower  wash it really well 
[03:32:30]  cock smell  I don't want to get  cock smell  on my razor  I don't think  it's good for  shaving long hair  he's got enough pubes  down there  that we could shave  his pubes  and then we could  like design  his mustache  maybe then we could  what if we take  your pubes  and then do like  a transplant  we can then  glue them  I don't think  I want pubes  on my face  we'll glue them  into a little  Fu Manchu  no no I don't  want that  I threw up  when I saw  Jackass number  two  which is  they did that 
[03:33:00]  they did that  at Jackass number  two  alright listen  you know what  this is a very  good idea  Eric should do  no shit  is he rocking  the area  this is a very  good idea  no no no  don't worry  don't worry  we love you  I would use  some of your  hair plugs  my sister says  your hair plugs  are very sexy  I don't have  hair plugs

[03:43:00]  was two hours  and twenty  minutes  this break  is pushing  an hour  and a half  we're gonna have to end  real early today  and then  it looks like  a retro  rocket  danny explain  because then  they're gonna  bitch in me  well see  the breaks  get backed up  so the less  breaks we take  the more we have  to take  towards the end  of the show  which means  that our end  time gets  pushed earlier  what's our  what's our  what's our  out  today  if we take  no more  breaks today  we'll need  to be out  at 1025  and that's  not us  trying to get  out early  that is a fact  right  that's because 
[03:43:30]  you went  two hours  and twenty minutes  you guys  got chock full  a show today  so fuck off  so we can't  even go to  1030 if we  wanted to  if you took  a break  right now  but it doesn't  even matter  because it's  right I hear  what you're saying  you can leave  that part out  uh dr steve  yes my friend  what the fuck  man now you're  making us sad  we're having fun  here and you  had to fucking  be the uh  the party poop  oh god  i can't look  at the pictures  of that  so what  what we're seeing  is his own  body leaking  out  what is it 
[03:44:00]  an infection  leaking out  pus  no no no  i think  he said  he had  hypospadias  and what  that is  is uh  some kids  are born  with a penis  where the tube  doesn't go  all the way  through the  the cock  and it uh  dump it  instead of  dumping out  at the  where your  cock hole  is at the  end of the  penis  it dumps  out underneath  it  and uh  so they have  sort of this  just rubbery  head with no  hole in it  and then the  hole is  under you know 
[03:44:30]  is underneath  the  right  wait so  so he pees  from below  the cock head  unless they  fixed it  but he's  he's had like  20 surgeries  to fix it  you can imagine  trying to fix  that  all right  bobo's in  studio  bobo what's  up you ran  in here all  excited  no no i just  came out of  the bathroom  okay how'd that  go  i went good  just had to  piss a truck  load  truck load  no i mean  actual pissing  all right i  can't do  you in that  bathroom  in that 
[03:45:00]  bathroom  maybe 57th  street i  could have  i'm a uh  i'm a little  confused by all  the technical  language that  doctor was  using  yes dr steve  can you uh  what part  cock hole  yeah  dr steve likes  keeping it  real  keeps it  real  what was it  he said i  didn't hear it  that you got  hypo uh  whatever you  called it  that your  cock hole  was underneath  your penis  when you were  born  yeah that  that's  very accurate  i remember  that the  way i peed 
[03:45:30]  when i was  younger  yeah  would you  have to  just pee  out of the  bottom  would your  dick take  off like a  harrier jet  no i had  to i had  to move it  a lot  yeah i had  to move it  a lot to  make sure it's  at the right  spot a lot  more than i  have to now  you could have  your dick  sticking straight  out and piss  on your shoes  right  well when i  was little  yeah i had  a problem  peeing my  pants when i  was little  so oh my  god  i'm literally  telling you  this when i

[03:46:30]  memory of  yeah like  sex with your  brother  that never  happened  that never  happened  yeah so  they fixed  your your  your penis  though they  covered up  the hole or  they drilled  the hole in  the tip of  your penis  what'd they do  yeah yeah  that's kind of  what they did  they made a  new hole  they made a  new hole  and kind of  extended your  urethra  yeah yeah  that's pretty much  what they did  i've had that  40 operation  because they  messed up the  first one  oh no  what'd they do  they had it  coming out  your ass  no they 
[03:47:00]  messed it up  i nearly  died of a  urinary infection  that's impossible  because they  wanted to show  the medical  students  the result  of the  operation  they left  it open  longer than  they were  supposed to  i have to  interrupt  because we  got the  great  louis ck  and steven  s from bayshore  is suggesting  dr steve  you could stay  there as well  that you name  your next batch  of shitty  wine after  bobo  we got  louis ck  louis  hey guys  um  i just had to  call because i was
