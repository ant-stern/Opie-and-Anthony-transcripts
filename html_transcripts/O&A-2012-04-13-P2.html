<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The After Opie and Anthony Live broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts and E-Rock, began with a heavy focus on Sam's new Instagram account, "Opie Radio," and the prevalent use of Instagram filters.  A large portion of the show was dedicated to reminiscing about Ricky Gervais's recent appearance.  Sam recounted a hilarious story about Gervais's unflappable reaction to a question about his preference for "man vagina or girl cock," highlighting Gervais's independent spirit and willingness to engage in the show's often outrageous humor, contrasting him favorably with other more reserved A-list celebrities.

The broadcast featured numerous listener calls, many centered around the overplayed Carly Rae Jepsen song, "Call Me Maybe," which had become a running gag due to one listener's extreme annoyance with its constant repetition on previous shows.  The conversation also branched out to include several Twitter personalities.  Sam and E-Rock engaged in ongoing banter with Jenny Hutt, focusing largely on her weight and online persona.  Other Twitter personalities like Justin Stengel and Bonnie McFarlane were also mentioned.

Further segments included discussion of behind-the-scenes conflict between staff member Roland and an unnamed individual.  A listener commented on Boy Butter sponsorship, and a joke about Joe Scarborough was shared.  A particularly memorable anecdote involved Roland cutting off his underwear with scissors while still wearing his pants.  The show featured a phone call with Jenny Hutt herself, in which she clarified her relationship with E-Rock, responded to Opie's previous comments about her, and addressed her weight issues directly.  The broadcast concluded with further playful banter comparing Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen, and a final return to the ongoing "Call Me Maybe" joke.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Does he have to say something nasty on the way out?  Who did?  Anthony.  He walks out and says, have fun with your shit show.  I've made it clear so many times  that this show is called After Opie and Anthony Live.  Starring E-Rock. 
[00:00:30]  E-Rock's new thing is to just sit here.  I like when E-Rock is on with you.  Ricky loved this picture I took of him.  Let me see.  This is going to be a cheap plug.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm on Instagram now, Opie Radio.  You adding a filter?  I'm going to go regular.  No, no, you've got to add a little something.  Give it a little something.  Because the last picture that you posted yesterday  had no filter either.  Give it a little something.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's on Instagram.  Should I go Amaro?  Let me see how it looks.  Amaro?  Yeah, see? 
[00:01:00]  That's cool.  How about Rise?  Let me see Rise.  Rise is just subtle.  I think Amaro's a little better.  All right.  Amaro over Rise.  Amaro looks a little washed out, though.  Yeah, but that's cool, though.  All right.  How about Hudson?  Hudson's a little dark.  Which one do you like so far?  Amaro.  What about Sierra with the border?  Sierra's my favorite so far.  Really?  What about X-Pro?  No.  No, Sierra.  All right.  I'm learning this shit.  Look at me.  Lo-fi?  Let me see.  I think I prefer Sierra. 
[00:01:30]  All right.  How about the early bird?  Let me see the early...  I like the rounded edges there.  It takes away from the brilliance of my photography, though.  Yeah, but it adds to it.  I want to just add a little bit.  I don't want it to become the thing.  Well, you haven't even...  We haven't even gotten into the blurs.  Where are the blurs on this thing?  Uh, it should be one of those things on top.  Should it?  It should be.  It is on the iPhone.  How about the Inkwell?  We'll go black and white with this shit.  E-Rock's bored.  Inkwell is good.  All right.  I love that we don't have to worry about ratings.  How about the Walden? 
[00:02:00]  Uh, I prefer the Inkwell.  Really?  Fuck.  Let me tell you something.  If we were worried about...  We're not going to go 1977, right?  No, no, no.  Right now, Inkwell.  What about the Kelvin?  Kelvin's weird.  Kelvin's a little too weird.  It takes away from the expression.  Yeah, Kelvin.  All right.  So which one?  Inkwell.  I'm going normal after all that.  Normal?  It's on Instagram.  Why wouldn't you just post it on Twitter?  How about the Rise?  Rise isn't bad.  Because I'm promoting my Instagram.  I want some fucking followers on, man.  Then you'll get some followers if you add some filters.  Nobody wants to see your Instagram.  Aren't these filters? 
[00:02:30]  You just said you were going to go normal.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to go with Amro.  Okay.  I like that.  You remember I said that.  Or Rise.  Go Amro.  I go Rise.  I thought you were going to say that.  That was reverse psychology.  All right.  I go Rise.  You're very predictable.  Whatever, dude.  Fuck your mother.  I wouldn't.  You might.  You got a weird thing for her.  Your mom?  Yeah.  In a perfect world, yeah, I probably would. 
[00:03:00]  Meaning no one gets mad and all that.  That's a compliment.  It's like, yeah.  And it's just a physical thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just looking at that body.  I understand it.  Tries to answer.  You can start your show.  This is the show.  Oh.  The ultimate question.  You understand?  Just hearing Opie's voice on the air gets listeners so excited that it doesn't matter.  No, they don't.  Yes, they do.  Shut up.  The ultimate question. 
[00:03:30]  I won't shut up.  You said I could talk.  They're being weird.  The ultimate question.  I'm actually doing a show.  All right.  I'm going with, because it was, I got him in mid, holy fuck, I got to answer the man  vagina slash female cock question.  Right.  And he put his hands over his face and was like, holy fuck, I don't know how to answer  this question.  I really captured a moment here, Sam.  You did.  I really captured a moment today.  It's amazing.  I'm going to put that, oh, rate Instagram. 
[00:04:00]  Remind me later.  No fucking thanks.  Oh, thank you.  You can figure out if you're good or not yourself.  All right.  There you go.  Ricky Gervais tries to answer the ultimate question.  Man, I am going to get fucking followers for Instagram now.  You think so?  Dude, I just talked about it for 10 minutes.  But what if they just go to your Twitter and click the link?  They could do that, too.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, I just got 51 new ones.  Boom.  Just like that.  How many followers are you up to?  I got 58.  58 followers.  58 followers.  I don't think I'm following you yet. 
[00:04:30]  You'll be up to 59 before the day's out.  I can guarantee it.  Did you have a good time rolling?  Who was coming here?  Huh?  He had to rush out, though.  What's he doing?  The Yankee game, I think.  Somebody forgot the tickets.  I have to go back home and then go to the Yankee game.  He's going to the Yankee game?  Yeah.  So I had to rush out.  See, I know other A-list celebrities have had a really good time on our show over the  years.  But for some reason, they feel like they're above the show.  And it frustrates me.  Ricky Gervais is like, no, I'm going to come in because I have a good time.  I mean, they promote my stuff.  The difference, too, is that Ricky... 
[00:05:00]  He doesn't need to be on our show anymore, Ricky Gervais.  But he's an independent thinker.  Like, his projects are his own.  Like, he doesn't surround himself with people that tell him what moves to make.  He does what he feels right in doing.  So, like, if he has a good time, he will be back.  Whereas another A-lister would let their publicist tell them, you know, which moves to make.  Right.  That's not Ricky Gervais.  And it becomes a chore for some of these...  His wife.  That's what I love about him.  What?  That he's just a dude.  Yeah.  He'd say, hey, you last way.  I'm like, thank you.  He just kept it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We like him. 
[00:05:30]  He really had a good time, too.  It's nerve-wracking because it's Ricky Gervais.  Right.  And you don't want to, like...  Oh, fuck.  Like, you're one question away from spoiling the biggest Hollywood relationship the show  has right now.  I think Rosa was nervous.  Yeah, Joey was nervous.  I was nervous a little bit.  It was his first time meeting him.  Yeah, he was babbling.  You're still nervous, even though you talked to him?  No, I was nervous a little bit, then loosened up, and then it became, God, just so much  fun.  That was a lot of fun, man.  Yeah.  He's the man.  I mean, he didn't get flustered.  Like, he didn't mind talking about whether or not he wanted man vagina or girl cock. 
[00:06:00]  He was tormented.  He was tormented by it, but he didn't mind that you asked.  I really hope he asked Carl.  Carl would have a brilliant answer to that.  And he would just snap right to it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He'd just have it.  And that's actually, too, Joe McHale is another big star, good friend of the show, because  you played in that awful Chevy Chase voicemail while he was sitting right there.  Right.  And he wasn't pissed about it.  No.  I wish he would have said something about it.  I mean, but let me just say, I mean, that's all right.  Yeah, I guess so.  He's got to go back to work with the guy. 
[00:06:30]  But for the people that have no idea who Carl is, you've got to watch An Idiot Abroad.  Yeah.  And you've got to watch the HBO show, obviously.  But that's more Carl animated.  You've got to see, I mean, they're both good, don't get me wrong.  But to see Carl, An Idiot Abroad, is just an amazing show.  An Idiot Abroad is just Carl.  Yeah.  Like, it's just...  With Ricky Gervais on a set.  Just fucking with him.  Right.  You don't even really...  You see Ricky in the beginning of the show, and then throughout the entire show, all you  see is Carl talking to Ricky on his phone. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  On speakerphone.  Yeah, Carl's the man.  It really is.  Damn, dude, I'm up to fucking 72 followers.  On Instagram?  Well, you didn't even say what your Instagram name was.  It's blowing up.  Opie Radio.  Opie Radio.  Because that fucking guy...  What fucking guy?  I really wish...  Jim Gaffigan?  Fuck Jim Gaffigan.  Are you sure?  I didn't think we were saying that.  Are you with Jim Gaffigan?  He'll be here next week.  I love Jim Gaffigan.  He's the man.  There's a guy...  Because, I mean, there's people out there that never do the right thing for whatever reason. 
[00:07:30]  There's a guy called Noor, N-O-R, Cal, C-A-L, Graffiti.  All one word.  Noor Cal Graffiti.  Yeah.  He just gave me my name on Instagram without holding me up.  And over the years, we've been held up for shit by our own fan base.  This guy just said, here, I don't want anything.  I reserved this for you a while ago.  It's yours.  Gave me the password and everything.  It's legit, obviously, because now I'm on it.  And I want E-Rock to send him some shit.  That'd be cool.  What kind of shit?  He's got a ton of shit from his office that we were giving away. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, really?  I'll find out what this guy wants and I'll send it out there.  You didn't hear the after show yesterday, did you?  About Troy fighting me and Kenny throwing me under the bus saying Troy could take me?  No, we played Carly Rae Jepsen's song like 19 times in a row.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's when I hung up on you.  That's right, you did.  Why'd you hang up?  Don't sing.  We don't need to play this song again.  We did this yesterday.  Ricky Gervais has Twittered me.  Oh, what's up?  He Twittered you?  Yeah.  He didn't Twitter Opie?  I asked him.  Oh, no. 
[00:08:30]  Wait, hold on.  Ready?  I didn't do shit.  I didn't do shit.  I think he's in the clear.  What did he tweet?  That I'm awesome.  He didn't tweet you.  He didn't say that.  What is he?  What did he write?  Did he actually tweet him?  No.  Yeah.  No?  There's no tweet there.  Holy fuck, you cunt.  Ricky Gervais.  Rolling.  The great Ricky Gervais on Opie and Anthony's show.  Ricky Gervais. 
[00:09:00]  Great fun as always.  Cheers.  See?  You want to take a call from Kevin in Connecticut, Opie?  Why?  He wants to talk to you.  About what?  We just throw the headphones on.  God, your iPhone is tiny, man.  My fucking galaxy rules.  What, Kevin?  Kevin in Connecticut.  You're on after Opie and Anthony live.  No, just who's this Opie guy in your show?  He sucks, Sam.  I want to do what we learned.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Do the what did I learn.  I like that bit.  What did you learn today, Opie?  Oh, sorry, Kevin. 
[00:09:30]  I shouldn't hang up on.  Opie, what did you learn?  Nothing.  After all this, you've learned nothing.  Who is?  Who's pissed off?  I heard.  Wow, someone's pissed off at all.  That's what I heard.  Don't say no, no, no.  You're whispering it in a room full of microphones.  Who's pissed at you?  Who's pissed?  Whisper it to me.  Who's pissed?  I learned something.  What did you learn?  Someone is really pissed off at Roland.  Oh.  Yeah, Roland started going no, no and pointing at the mics.  You can't say it in a live studio. 
[00:10:00]  Joey, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, it's bad.  It's bad.  Who is it?  I can't say, but it's really bad.  Really bad?  Pissed at Roland?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Can you give us a hint?  He's going to get in really trouble, he said.  I'm just trying to figure out what rhymes with Scott.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:10:30]  Roland is physically removing Opie from the studio.  Roland has never touched me before.  He's physically removing Opie from the studio.  Don't be serious.  Ah!  The sweaty man has touched me.  The panda bear's mad.  The panda bear's mad.  Are you mad?  And I have my coat on.  Oh, no.  You better unzip that coat.  Look, I was trying to keep it like, you know, like, like, you know, sort of secretive  by trying to come up with a rhyme for Scott.  Oh, geez.  He said it again, Roland.  Hey, Opie.  What?  Justin Stengel says hi. 
[00:11:00]  Tell him where the fuck has he been.  What do you mean, where has he been?  He's been doing it.  He works for David Carter.  Is he really saying hi to me?  Yeah, he texted me.  He said, tell Opie I said hi.  He's one of the only underscores I follow on Twitter.  I have a rule.  I don't follow underscore people.  Except they got it.  How?  I think he's Justin underscore Stengel.  On Twitter.  He's like one of the kings of Twitter.  I think so.  He is.  You know, there are kings of Twitter and he is one of them.  Yeah.  I think Andy Levy's up there.  I think the E-Rock Radio is up there. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Dude, 84 followers on Instagram.  Did you figure out something to rhyme with Scott?  No, man.  Scott, bot, cot, dot.  Roland.  That's what I do.  Fot, dot, dot.  Are you happy?  Hot, pot.  It rhymes with hot.  Oh.  You're next.  Why am I next?  We'll see what happens to you.  Nothing's going to happen to me.  I didn't do anything.  This is what I do now.  He's just staring at me.  He's mad at Opie, so he's going to take it out on me.  I don't know about him.  What did I do to you? 
[00:12:00]  You knew shit.  Exactly.  He only just threw you under the bus.  Just don't fucking, like, rip my arms off.  I won't.  Is it Justin underscore Stengel?  I guess so.  Also, who are...  Colin Quinn is one of the kings of Twitter.  Well, yeah.  He turned it into his own.  That Jenny Broad is...  Who?  She's a writer, man.  She's beyond funny.  I thought you were going to talk about Eric's crush, Jenny Hutton.  Eric's crush, Jenny Hutton.  Jenny Hutton?  Jennifer Hutton sucks on Twitter.  Oh, my God.  And E-Rock is nodding. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, I had a cookie for Passover.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  Yeah, but E-Rock's got a little crush on her.  He does, like, flirty things with her.  She does.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he does, like, pulling her hair on the playground type of things with her.  No, I don't.  It gets weird.  He takes pictures of her pants every day.  It's just like, oh, I'm going to be on the treadmill for three hours today.  I had a knush for one of these religious holidays.  I dropped a $100 bill.  Why bend over?  I'm rich.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, she is pretty rich.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Roland was yelling at her yesterday in the lobby.  Why? 
[00:13:00]  Because she was going for another celebrity picture.  And Roland hates that Jenny Hutt, who's been on the show before.  She does just Jenny.  Roland hates that she takes photos with all the celebrities that come in.  I don't hate it.  Just like she, like, um.  Roland, why you hate that?  I don't hate it.  She is like a gorilla marketing.  Yeah, when she just jumps in with them.  You don't like Jennifer Hutt, right?  Yeah, he has, like, a little crush on her.  Do you have a crush on her?  He does, like, the weird.  The pant photos is because I told you the bit that I was saving up to do.  What's your bit?  The bit.  Because she wears these outrageous spandex pants.  I just passed over 100 followers on Instagram. 
[00:13:30]  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Opie Radio.  I was going to plug it for you.  You don't always have to plug your own shit.  I'm the host now.  Nice.  You just need to sit back and relax and enjoy yourself.  I stopped using that thing, and people are still following me.  Why do you stop?  Don't bring down Opie's steam like that.  This is the first time I've logged into it in God knows how long.  Oh.  Well, I got artistic pictures I'm going to put up there.  I found a building that actually had a 13th floor.  Oh, wow.  Going back to what we did today. 
[00:14:00]  It's exciting.  Isn't it?  Oh, boy.  Eric, what are you doing there for?  Who's the gen chick that I like on Twitter?  Now I want to...  Well, you've made it quite clear it's not Jenny Hud.  Nah, she's...  She's fucking...  That broad hates herself.  She's nice, though.  You think Jenny Hud hates herself?  Oh, God, yeah.  Why?  I gained a pound.  What am I going to do?  She texted me last night and said I was looking skinnier than usual in a good way.  Yeah, she's obsessed with weight.  She did.  She told me she's obsessed with weight.  Where's this broad, man?  But you don't think she's good on Twitter, you said. 
[00:14:30]  Nah, not really.  Bonnie McFarlane's pretty good.  Bonnie McFarlane's very good.  She just tweeted, now you know how I feel.  I mean, that's a great tweet.  It's amazing.  Who?  Bonnie McFarlane.  Oh.  Where's this broad?  Do something, Sam.  I'm just trying to find something here.  All right.  Dave in New York, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, hey, Sam.  You're like a heroin dealer, man.  You give us a little piece of something and then we get used to it and we want it and  then you won't play the hook again on that song.  You got to play that hook. 
[00:15:00]  You want a little bit of the hook?  I don't have my headphones on, so I have no idea what's going to happen.  All right.  Let's hit the hook.  All right.  Let's hit it a little bit.  This is crazy.  Come on, Opie.  Listen to this.  Put it up to his ear, Eric.  Put it right on his ear.  Here's my number.  Call me, maybe.  What do you think, Opie?  Wonderful.  E-Rock, you know he's not going to be on the bandwagon.  He's going to be.  Eventually, he'll be on the bandwagon. 
[00:15:30]  He'll get there.  He'll get there.  But here's what will happen.  Sometime next week, he'll say he was in the car and he heard this great song.  Right.  And then he'll ask us to play and talk about how great it was and then we have to remind  him that we played this last week.  After Opie and Anthony Live, we'll get no credit.  I'm right here.  I liked your little argument yesterday telling Hits 1 that, no, you broke this artist.  I did.  Mikey Piff, he does the programming for Hits 1.  He almost never plays this song.  No.  He plays and he's like, no, it's on Hits 1.  And I go, no, Piff.  Nobody's ever heard it on your stupid station. 
[00:16:00]  And people heard it 19 times in a row on my show yesterday.  I broke the song.  Period.  Dude, I'm just trying to find this broad and I can't do it.  Pirate Trucker.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  All right, Sam.  Enjoy your show.  Hang on.  He's helping you out.  I think it's Jenny K he's looking for.  Jenny K?  Yeah.  Jenny K?  Pirate Trucker says Jenny K.  Yeah, that's true, everybody.  All the ONA people follow her. 
[00:16:30]  Huh?  Pirate Trucker, say that again.  Obi was not prepared.  All the ONA people follow Jenny K.  He said all the ONA people follow her.  Huh?  All the ONA people follow her.  Oh.  I didn't have my headphones on again.  I know.  You took them off.  I don't know why.  No, there's another Jenny.  Oh, my God.  She's a writer.  She knows a lot of fucking people.  Is it Jenny Hut?  No!  She stinks on Twitter.  You don't like her?  No!  You like her treadmill videos?  No!  Oh, Jesus.  It's not going to make her feel...  You like the song?  I don't like people that hate themselves. 
[00:17:00]  You can turn this up a little.  Eric, what are you doing?  Someone help me with this broad, because it's going to kill me.  Jenny...  Just listen to the song a little bit.  Luke, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Sam, you got this song stuck in my head.  I'm telling you.  We're doing more for Carly Rae Jepsen on this show than anyone else has on radio in America. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, hey, yeah.  And that girl is Jenny High Five.  Jenny High Five?  I just found it, too.  It's actually Jenny Johnson High Five.  Jenny Johnson High Five?  And you don't spell out five.  This broad is, I'm telling you, one of the kings of Twitter.  I should have looked at the...  First of all, it's Queen.  And second of all, I should have looked at the feedback.  That was actually chimed in five minutes ago.  Will in Houston got that five minutes ago. 
[00:18:00]  Jenny Johnson High Five.  Like, who thinks of this shit?  My idea of hell would be Sean White and Carrot Top taking turns sneezing in my face.  That's a good tweet.  Is it?  Yeah.  Why would you want guys to sneeze in your face?  You wouldn't.  That's why it's her idea of hell.  I don't like that.  Actual hell.  Like, she's in hell.  No, I don't like that.  Why don't you like that?  I just, I mean, a quarter, yeah, that would be, I could think of many unpleasant things.  I'm not going to tweet about them. 
[00:18:30]  My husband took my Reese's peanut butter eggs to work this morning, so I had to eat an apple  for breakfast like some kind of goddamn hippie.  That's not even...  I like it.  That's...  Jenny Hutt's upset, though.  Why?  Wow, you're actually, you're going to love this, Opie.  This so goes to your point.  She's texting me.  She's not listening, but she's reading on Twitter.  She goes, why is Opie trashing me?  I'm not listening.  I just saw it on Twitter, and then she wrote with a bunch of exclamation points, is anyone  calling me fat?  See?  Thank you. 
[00:19:00]  Listen, Jenny Hutt, you should be listening to After Opie and Anthony live every single  day.  Every single day.  We're breaking artists.  We had the ghost show on Wednesday.  We had the Carly Rae Jepsen show on Thursday.  Today, we're having another barn burner.  I got you a guest for Monday.  You got me a guest for Monday.  You hear this, Opie?  You hear what's going on after your show?  The whole documentary, the scheme of Buzz.  Which one?  The whole.  Oh, yeah?  Let's do it.  This show is getting a lot of Buzz.  I got to go, but I don't want to blow up Roland's spot. 
[00:19:30]  Okay.  You know, there's some shit going on here.  Right, he's in trouble.  Someone around here is very mad at him.  And it rhymes with pot.  Okay.  See, I did it right that time.  Yeah, there you go.  People remember from before, though, like 10 minutes ago.  No, they don't listen to the whole show, so they have no idea what I'm talking about.  He has to be 75 minutes.  That's right.  So he's safe right now.  I'm pretty sure Kevin from Connecticut listens for more than 10 minutes at a time.  Well, yeah, he has nothing else to do.  Well, he's still.  He contributes. 
[00:20:00]  Before, he was in trouble.  Now, Roland's not in trouble.  Why is that?  Yay.  What?  Why is he not in trouble?  Because it just rhymes with pot.  No one knows what that means.  Yeah, but they can just rewind on the app.  Not yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, they can?  Yeah, it's on the app.  I didn't do shit!  Mark in Texas.  Hey, Sam.  What's going on?  How you doing, buddy?  Pretty good, man.  Hey.  Have a good weekend, Opie.  Do me a favor, man.  Quit playing that song.  Why?  It's really irritating. 
[00:20:30]  You and Chris Isaac were talking about that song.  I have to play it 19 times.  I swear, man.  I had to change the channel, man.  You don't like it?  No.  Not at all.  I was almost going to puke.  You don't find it catchy?  Not really.  No, I mean, not at all.  All right, Mark.  Everybody's entitled to their opinion.  Scott in Virginia.  What did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  Let's get this thing started.  Well, today, after the conversations they had, I've learned why the sales staff thought 
[00:21:00]  it would be a good idea for Boy Butter to sponsor the show.  That's true.  I've heard Boy Butter commercials are not going to be on the show anymore, and I would hope  that after hearing today's conversations with Joe DeRosa about Buck Angel and Bailey Jay  and all these people, that maybe the sales staff would say, all right, now we really got  to get Boy Butter.  Now we got to go hard in the motherfucking paint to get Boy Butter.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't know.  I learned today that Professor Anthony, that's going back a little ways, Professor Anthony, 
[00:21:30]  he knows a little bit about a lot of things.  And one of those things is freebasing.  He taught me how to freebase today.  E-Rock, did you know Professor Anthony knew how to freebase?  No, but I think we all learned.  I don't know if I'm going to try it.  Are you going to try it?  Freebasing?  Yes.  Now that I know how to make it, I might as well put it to good use.  Ivan in California, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, I want to send a big F you to Sam Roberts and Chris Isaac for getting that stupid 
[00:22:00]  fucking song stuck in my head.  But it's in your head, isn't it?  Fuck you.  Sing a little bit.  No, he doesn't want to.  How come nobody wants to sing except for me on this show, Eric?  I learned something today.  What did you learn?  I learned that Joe Scarborough had an intern die in his office.  I learned that Joe Scarborough benefited from September 11th.  How is that not?  That guy's just looking out all over the place.  How can anyone not get why that's so funny? 
[00:22:30]  The concept of somebody benefiting like that.  Oh, geez.  I'm getting...  I just got 150 text messages in a row from Jenny Hut.  She wants to call in.  Okay.  Or call me.  She doesn't have the phone number.  Eric, can you...  It's on the screen.  866...  Get off your phone and look at the screen and then call.  So you're saying 866-WOW-WOW is the number for her?  969-1969.  Okay.  There, spelt it out for you.  Joe in Oceanside.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  What up?  I learned that Joe DeRosa loves Girl Cucks. 
[00:23:00]  He did.  The quote from...  Hey, Sam.  Yeah.  Sam.  Yeah.  Bump that fucking song again.  Don't play it or play it?  Don't play it.  All right.  Hey, Ron.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  This is crazy.  Call me, baby.  Maybe.  It's a baby that time.  Love you, Sam.  Thank you, Joe.  I feel very strongly for you, but I just haven't gotten to that place yet.  The theme of...  I bet by the time we get to Cleveland two weeks from today... 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  ...and we do before after Open Anthony Live at the Hard Rock,  I'm either going to be gang-raped and beaten to death,  or I'm going to get the entire crowd singing this song.  One of the two is going to happen,  and you're going to have to be in Cleveland at the Hard Rock to find out.  Well, what if both happens?  They'll all sing...  They'll be...  They all sing this song as they're doing it.  As they're stomping me to death, they're all singing,  This is crazy.  Call me, baby. 
[00:24:00]  That could easily happen.  What else?  I thought I learned something else today.  Oh!  Eric, you know what else I learned today?  What is that, Sam?  Scientists are better than some old ghost,  as far as learning things go.  Well, that's just logic.  How great was Ricky Gervais on the show today?  It was fucking awesome.  I'm actually going to listen to the whole thing on the replay.  You are?  You're going to re-listen?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, maybe I will, too.  And that's going to be, of course, part of after Open Anthony...  I mean, not after...  Whatever the show on the weekend. 
[00:24:30]  Worst of the week countdown.  It'll be number two on the countdown behind...  What? Spoilers!  ...behind Call Me Maybe, which will debut at number one.  Are you actually...  You should put part of yesterday's after show on the countdown.  You know that.  I was just going to put the song in,  but if you want me to put the countdown...  I think...  Listen.  This week has been a banner week for after Open Anthony Live.  You had the great Bob Kelly on Wednesday,  and we did the ghost show.  Everybody loved it.  Yesterday, I got more feedback for playing that goddamn song 15 times in a row than I've ever gotten for any after Open Anthony Live show. 
[00:25:00]  Ever.  And this was happening all day.  Like, just as it started to slow down, I'd have another wave because of the replay.  And then overnight, another wave because of whatever it is, the midnight replay.  It's insane.  And then, like, on Facebook, I guess...  You know, I'm on Facebook, Primetime Sam Roberts,  but I'm looking at the, uh, all the people, whatever.  What's it called?  The, all the, your friends thing? 
[00:25:30]  The timeline?  Is that...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I hate that timeline.  When everybody's updating their statuses, and you're reading their statuses, what's that called?  Oh, yeah, it's in the upper right-hand corner, right?  Whatever it is.  When you're going down and looking at everybody's statuses, everybody, they have most of them,  and they're all fans of O&A, so I know where they're getting it from.  They weren't even citing where it was from.  They were just putting up Carly Rae Jepsen videos and saying that that's their new shit.  It was very impactful.  Um, what else did I learn today? 
[00:26:00]  Let's see.  Look, this is, and it's making the show difficult.  Because I'm trying to do, uh, what did you learn on the show today?  And all I've got is a phone bank full of people asking me to play Carly Rae Jepsen again.  Not yet, Eric.  I see your fingers on those buttons.  Trigger happy.  Not yet.  You were trigger happy today.  You must have been in paradise, you little Billy Joel mark.  Playing all those Billy Joel songs.  You're a big fan of his.  I am a big fan of Billy Joel.  And that's why you had him.  Okay, we got celebrity on the phone. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, that's not a celebrity.  Jenny, hi.  What?  What are you doing reading my texts, you little chit, sir?  Look, you can't text me and expect for them to be private.  Especially while he's live on the air.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I think it's funny.  I heard on Twitter that you were saying something that I didn't even know what.  Yeah, uh, well, basically, Opie, it started because Opie said that he, there was a Jenny  that he liked on Twitter.  And I said, is it Jenny Hut?  And he said, no, no, no.  She's terrible on Twitter.  Which I thought was uncalled for. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, I don't care.  I'm happy with my Twitter personality.  What I was bringing to me.  And then I heard he said that I hate myself.  He said that you hate yourself and that you're weight obsessed.  And I told him, I told him about our conversation last night when you actually told me you were  weight obsessed.  And you said I was looking skinny.  I am.  But I also, I also brought this up, that it's become apparent to me based on the interactions  that I've seen behind the scenes.  And as much as he brings you up on Twitter and elsewhere, that E-Rock has developed a 
[00:27:30]  little bit of a Jenny Hut crush.  No, stop it.  Look.  We're just cows.  We're all bros.  He's going around.  He's doing like, he might as well be tugging on your little pigtails in the playground.  Oh, no.  That's just silly talk.  And he's just now, he's like, no, that's gross.  I don't like Jenny Hut.  Ew.  Which is exactly.  I didn't say that.  What you say.  By the way, he wouldn't say that.  We're friends. 
[00:28:00]  Listen, here's the thing.  What?  It's totally true that I am weight obsessed.  I have issues.  And I do battle the whole self-loathing thing.  Yeah.  But so immediately, if someone says that anyone says something nasty about me, I go right  to the crap that they call me fat, even though I'm not fat anymore.  Once a fatty, always a fatty mentally, right?  But there's no part of you that wants to help the sex man, Eric Nagel, out with his weight  problem?  Well, I was going to get to the Eric part.  It's that Eric and I are friends.  I adore him.  He's sweet. 
[00:28:30]  Why would I, what would I, what's with his weight?  I mean, I don't have, I noticed that you got skinny because you did.  Right.  But with Eric, I don't.  Well, Eric's heavier than he's ever been right now.  He's 230 pounds.  Oh, well, I don't, I didn't realize that.  So does he want to change that?  No, he doesn't want to change that, Jenny.  He wants you.  Do you not understand that?  I don't understand.  He has a crush on you.  Oh, please.  I'm married as a gay.  Come now.  Relax.  Mars. 
[00:29:00]  Mars.  Have you been hearing the song that we've been playing?  Yes.  What do you think?  Sucks.  You don't like it.  You're like a club guy, though.  You can't see that.  Is there a club song that's up and coming?  Better than that piece of shit you play?  Hang on, hang on.  Play it for Mars.  I don't think he heard it.  Hey.  What do you think, Mars?  Jenny, what do you think of this song?  Is that my favorite?  That's Carly Rae Jepsen.  Is that me dancing on YouTube?  No.  Have you danced to this song? 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  There's a video on YouTube of me dancing.  It's seven seconds long.  Did you know that after Open Anthony Live, this show broke her in America?  No.  Yesterday, we did it.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Obviously, you know there's a video of me dancing to that song for seven seconds on YouTube.  Listen, Jenny.  What?  Maybe Obie was right.  It's not always about you.  We didn't know.  Oh, stop it.  You're so naxious.  We didn't know there was a video of you dancing to it.  I mean, maybe Eric did, because I know he scans your...  Oh, that's what it is to me. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah?  Listen, Sam.  What?  You're darling.  Thank you.  And I'm a big fan of everything you do on every single channel every day.  Thank you.  I do a lot.  And I love your acting.  I love being Anthony.  So, I'm rolling it.  No big deal.  All right.  Well, thank you for calling in.  And let us know if E-Rock keeps flirting with you, okay?  Okay, but can you at least tell people that there is that stupid video for seven seconds  on YouTube?  What's your website?  Oh, justjenny.com.  Okay.  All of it's there, right? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, of course.  All right.  Justjenny.com.  All right.  Goodbye.  Bye.  I dumped out of it, Sam.  It's all right.  No, justjenny.com is fine to plug here, okay?  There's a little give and take where you make fun of somebody, then you let them plug their  website, and then everything's cool in the end.  That's the vibe of this show.  This show, after opening anything live, everybody's cool in the end.  That's what we do.  Now, Eric.  Yeah.  You really don't have a crush on her?  No.  All right.  I am obsessed with her awful pants. 
[00:31:00]  You're obsessed with a lot about her.  I don't know.  What are you taking all the pictures of her pants for?  I'm starting a new bit.  What's the bit?  I'm going to have a comparison piece.  It's going to be called Hooker Wrestler Jennifer Hutt.  Oh, Jesus.  And you're just going to see a little portion of a pattern.  You have to tell me if they're being worn by a hooker, a wrestler, or Jennifer Hutt.  Is this going to be on Twitter?  Yeah.  Can't wait for it.  Who do you think is better, Springsteen or Billy Joel?  I never was really into Springsteen. 
[00:31:30]  I've been a big Billy Joel fan, so I've got to say Billy Joel.  I think you're right.  I think Billy Joel is better than Bruce Springsteen.  I think Bruce is more famous, but...  People are more obsessed with Bruce, right?  And Bruce has done more...  Bruce has got that weird...  It's like a cult following, like the Grateful Dead and all that stuff.  People just travel everywhere to wherever Bruce is playing.  Yeah, and he's continued to make music.  Yeah.  Which Billy Joel, like, he's got his little fan base, but after that, when did you become  obsessed with Billy Joel?  When I was a kid.  Really?  Yeah.  Growing up on Long Island, yeah, I mean... 
[00:32:00]  Eric.  It's hard not to.  We're not doing bits.  It's after Open Anthony Live.  No, we're not doing bits that I live in fucking Florida.  You can feel free to be honest.  You didn't grow up anywhere in Long Island.  I grew up on Long Island.  You grew up on Miami Beach.  Everybody knows that.  Now it's Miami?  I thought it was West Palm.  I think you were born in Miami, raised in West Palm.  I don't know for sure.  No, no, no, no.  I know you spent a lot of time in West Palm growing up.  The other thing that I was disappointed that Open Anthony didn't really delve into today  was the Call Me Maybe song? 
[00:32:30]  No.  They're not up on that yet.  That's an after ONA Live specialty.  They didn't even really talk about the fact that yesterday, Roland, who's a talent booker  on a very high-profile show here at SiriusXM, used a pair of scissors to remove his underwear  while he was still wearing his pants.  Well, we made a mention of it, but they didn't really go with it.  I don't know why.  I mean, that's the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life yesterday.  You had to go and tell everybody, and not just tell them that he did it. 
[00:33:00]  You reenacted what he was doing.  You wouldn't want to share that information with people?  I didn't have to.  You were already doing it.  I just followed you.  But you would have.  That shit is crazy.  Here's my number.  Call me.  Maybe.  And then you went back into the office using the scissors like tongs and pulled the scraps  of his underwear back out of the garbage can to put on his chair.  I wanted everybody to see it.  Ryan in Las Vegas, you're on After Open Anthony Live. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, so after a 12-hour day at work, I go home and I lay down on my pillow.  I close my eyes and it's like a fucking pop song.  Hey, I just met you.  This is crazy.  Here's my number.  Call me, baby.  It was in your head?  Oh, Jesus.  I think I had about a good 45 minutes until I punched myself in the face until I fell asleep.  And the best part is that most of the people that you or I, Ryan, would associate with  have never heard the song before. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, my God.  So you go up to them.  You're like, have you heard that song?  You know, so call me, maybe.  And they're like, no, I haven't heard that song.  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Oh, yeah.  I'm glad I can make your life better.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Roland.  Ew.  They didn't really go with your underpants today.  No, thank God.  It was fucking hilarious.  I think it was more of a bit you had to be there.  I guess so, because it was the funniest shit I've ever seen in my life.  You removed your underpants without taking off your jeans using a pair of scissors. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Just because.  Well, you said, here's scissors.  I said you won't.  That's a challenge.  Now, I also went to Troy and said, Troy, you won't snip off your underwear.  And you know what he said?  Because he's a pussy.  You think so?  He's a pussy.  You know, Eric believes Billy Joel is better than Bruce Springsteen.  Do you like Billy Joel?  I like Billy Joel, but overall, concert-wise, Bruce held up better.  Yeah, I prefer.  I love Billy Joel in concert, but Bruce puts on a better, longer show. 
[00:35:00]  He's more fit.  So you can run around, jump, do the oldies.  Because Billy Joel's voice is because of the drinking and everything.  Yeah.  And he stopped making music and stuff.  I prefer Billy Joel's hits to Bruce Springsteen's hits, but I don't go deep with it either.  Billy Joel does a stupid classical shit, but without words.  So like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  All right.  Well, look, I think we've got to get out of here for the weekend.  Is that right, Eric?  Yeah, we have to go.  Brandon, last call of the day, last call of the week.  All right.  First of all, Ginny Hutt's fat. 
[00:35:30]  Second of all, Sam, pump that shit.  Here we go.  Only one way to start the weekend.  Thank you for listening.  We'll be back with more of this on Monday.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.  Goodbye. </pre>
