<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing their sleep schedules and a water leak in Opie's basement bar.  This transitioned into a lengthy segment focused on Bobo, a frequent guest, and his disastrous stand-up performance at the Stress Factory comedy club, opening for Rich Vos.  The hosts played audio and video clips of Bobo's set, dissecting his awkward stage presence, bizarre introductions (including his description of Rich Vos as "the Jew with the right amount of stupidity and the horse of a smile"), failed crowd work, and an improvised "stockbroker" bit.  They also criticized Vinny, the Stress Factory host, for his overly energetic hosting style, and commented on other comedians' performances, including a bombing Asian female comedian and an energetic middle act whose energy was mistaken for humor.  Bobo's family's reactions in the audience were also noted.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the hosts' frustrations with SiriusXM management regarding their efforts to engage listeners through podcasts and social media, efforts for which they claimed to receive reprimands.  They also discussed their individual projects and the success of the SiriusXM app, before touching upon sports news: the Yankees, Brett Favre's move to the Minnesota Vikings, a Shaquille O'Neal trade, and the functionality of iPhones, including picture tweeting.

Next, the hosts launched into a discussion about the perceived decline of Cleveland, Ohio, comparing it to Detroit and Newark, New Jersey. Callers contributed anecdotes, with one attributing the decline to school busing in the 1970s.  Opie's nicotine gum addiction became a major topic, with hosts and callers debating its merits compared to other smoking cessation methods and highlighting the addictive nature of nicotine.  The conversation also included discussions of Brett Favre's move to the Minnesota Vikings (with perspectives from callers Jeremy and Mongo), a caller who repossesses houses in Cleveland, and a humorous debate over the pronunciation of "Newark."  Opie's new golf pants and an invitation to play at Bethpage Black, along with the difficulty of securing a tee time there, were discussed, alongside a brief mention of a methane-leaking mall in Boston.

The show then included a segment on video games (Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2002 and Hot Shots Golf), featuring studio guest Rich Vos, who expressed a preference for realistic graphics.  A professional golfer who quit the sport called in, leading to a discussion of handicaps, course difficulties (Bethpage Black and Old Corkscrew), and the caller's experiences with women at country clubs. This segued into a news story about a Philadelphia man who played pornography to deter children, leading to discussions about noise ordinances and the diminishing size of phone books.  Rich Vos’s golf game was also jokingly critiqued, followed by tangents on Cameron Diaz’s appearance and a local news reporter’s hair conditioner usage.  The Philadelphia porn story was revisited, mentioning Detective Goggin's name.  "Little Nicky," an erratic individual, unexpectedly entered the studio.

Kevin Smith then called in, discussing his latest film (mentioning Tracy Morgan and Sean William Scott), his Carnegie Hall performance, and thanking Opie and Anthony for promoting his show.  Bobo called in, leading to a lengthy, sexually explicit, and confusing discussion about his alleged past sexual experiences with his brother.  The hosts used nicknames like "Bro Blow" and "Blow Blow," and Bobo promoted an upcoming Mets game appearance before performing a song titled "Jizz in My Pants."  A gay exorcism video was briefly mentioned.

A subsequent segment featured a recurring bit where the hosts and Rich judged "gay" versus "exploring" sexual acts based on graphic images, using homophobic slurs and explicit descriptions.  This was followed by a discussion of a home invasion where a retired Coast Guard special operations officer and his fiancée subdued the intruders, debating the legality and appropriateness of their actions.  The show then introduced Simple Mike, a new intern, who was subjected to ridicule due to his perceived lack of work ethic and social skills.  His Britney Spears music video parody and a short film called "Bike" were shown and criticized.

The final segment focused on "Bike," with interpretations ranging from lost innocence to an anti-war statement (mandated by a film festival).  A video of Sam, a show producer, giving a pep talk to the interns, revealing various interpersonal conflicts and complaints about work ethic and sleep schedules, was shown.  Simple Mike was repeatedly singled out for his poor work habits and strange dance routines.  The show also discussed intern behavior outside of work, including bizarre "training" tasks inflicted on a former intern, David.  Simple Mike unexpectedly resigned via email during the broadcast, prompting further discussion.  The show concluded with Rich Vos promoting his stand-up appearances and further commentary on the interns’ antics.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi.  Good morning.  This is called Fake Energy. How's everybody doing?  Hey, hey, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The reality, I've been awake for 47 minutes.  Wow.  I got this down to a science.  47? Yeah.  Well, maybe, yeah, a little more than that, maybe.  I was up at 5.50.  What? 
[00:00:30]  5? No, 4.50.  Alright, you're scaring me.  5.50 is like 15 minutes ago.  Maybe that's the problem.  No, actually, I was asleep until 5.50.  Was I boring you that much?  No, I just get sleepy.  Well.  It's that fucking alarm and just going like, there's nothing you can do about it.  You gotta get up. Here you go.  Gotta get up.  Snacks.  You're allowed to talk, Rich.  I don't need an alarm. 
[00:01:00]  You know, if I say in my head.  Put your headphones on, Rich.  Really?  I say in my head, if I.  Thank you, Rich.  If I have to get up at like 6 o'clock, I'll get up without an alarm.  That doesn't happen with you guys?  Like, you're not used to.  Your body won't get up?  No, I'm tired in the morning.  I'll just lay there.  I'll sleep until.  As a matter of fact, I was pulling out of the driveway and Keith came driving by.  He goes, just making sure you're up.  What the hell's wrong with him?  Because he was on his way home or to work or somewhere.  So, yeah, the hours are all fucked up now. 
[00:01:30]  So, um.  You know what that really is about, right?  What?  You left your house a little too late this morning.  Was that it?  Ah, ah, ah.  Keith sneaks in there just as you're leaving to, you know, have the run of the joint.  To just kick back.  Without having to, like, wait on you.  On the movie theater.  Yeah, without having to listen to my bullshit.  He's putting his feet up.  He's going into that warm jacuzzi.  Call the pool guy.  The autofill isn't working.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Although the autofill was working in my basement.  What happened? 
[00:02:00]  Ah, a goddamn fucking water line let loose on the ice maker.  Oh, shit.  Behind the bar.  Behind the bar.  But at least it didn't hit the carpet.  So it was on the nice wood floor for the bar.  So, I was fine.  Keith.  Thank God.  Everybody, I want everybody to know that it's okay.  My bar area is fine.  I know they're very concerned.  Well, look.  The phones are just left.  They're all concerned.  I really want to know, make sure I'm okay.  We'll do the homo exorcism in a little bit. 
[00:02:30]  What you say?  Just stick around.  It's not a demon.  I don't need it.  Come on, you homosexual demon.  Get out of the way.  Get out.  Right now, I command you to leave.  What the fuck is going on in Connecticut?  The power of cock compels you.  Before we give you the full story.  I suck cock in hell. 
[00:03:00]  Before we get into that, we have to bring the Bobo thing to the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Bobo is our favorite person almost ever.  And we still don't know what to do with him.  He's been doing our show off and on for the last, what, four or five months, six months maybe?  Yeah, about that.  As a star.  Mr. Met 8 on Twitter.  Mr. Met 8, yeah.  Mr. Met 8.  He just thinks he is a star.  E-Rock, you want to read some of the better Bobo tweets?  All right.  This first one here. 
[00:03:30]  Going to the Mets game on Friday.  All of my fans who are going to look for me at the subway exit, you might see me as I'm waiting for a friend.  So he Twittered to everybody, to his fans, his big fan base, that if you're looking for him, if you're like, hey, we're going to the game, you know who goes to the game a lot?  I'm like, fucking Bobo.  So we might see him.  I wonder where.  Dude, he says he's going to be at the subway station. 
[00:04:00]  I've been on this show for seven years fighting to get people into my club.  Yeah, yeah.  He's on for four months, and they're going to go see him in fucking Penn Station.  In a subway station waiting for a friend.  There's Bobo.  Well, the funny thing about that, if Ant and I tweeted that exact same thing, we'd have no one show up.  I know.  That's the reality.  Yeah.  People aren't going to go out of their way to meet me or Ant on a fucking subway platform.  Going to the game.  But with Bobo, no, it's going to happen in his mind. 
[00:04:30]  Feds will come up to me, and they will say hello.  Wow.  What a rude awakening.  He really, really is into his newfound celebrity status.  Well, I love the fact that he has no shyness whatsoever in him.  No.  In himself.  He's got unbelievable self-confidence.  We thought he was a shy, like, introverted guy when we first met him.  Right.  And then it turns out, no, he just blurted shit out. 
[00:05:00]  Well, we got him to go on stage at the Stress Factory before Rich Voss.  Yes.  Well, the reason a guy like that has confidence, because you know he's a little slow,  but he probably has, like, a 10-inch dick or something, and that gives you, like, some  kind of confidence.  You've never seen it.  Yeah, we did, actually.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Lucky you.  Put your pinky up in the air.  Yeah.  Now cover this knuckle and this knuckle.  No, really?  Maybe.  He thinks he has a tight pussy, then. 
[00:05:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  You want to talk about nothing.  Poor lad.  Poor little feller.  That's the worst.  When you go to pull down a guy's pants, he has nothing, and you wasted all that time.  Doesn't that suck, Rich?  Jesus.  You're like, Jesus.  I drilled a hole for this.  I drilled a hole.  So we got him to do, what, two minutes before you at the Stress Factory?  Yeah.  And me and Ann were watching the video. 
[00:06:00]  I posted it up on my YouTube channel, OP Radio, whatever, but there's so much going on in this  fucking video, man.  Oh, yeah.  He's just so confident on the stage.  He comes up, and he doesn't just intro Rich.  Right.  He does a little material first.  Yeah.  And then he does the old...  What was his line about the stockbroker?  I couldn't do it justice, because he got it so wrong.  Couldn't you pop up the video?  And he did it twice.  Once, I guess, for the early show, once for the late show.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  And it was just...  Oh, so doujee.  But he's just taking his time up there.  He needs to find someone from Jersey so he can do his Jersey bit.  And he's looking around the room.  Who's from Jersey?  What do you do for a living?  Yeah.  Like a seasoned comic.  So you know him as a regular performance on the European Anthony radio show all the way  from Queens, New York.  Please give me a loud, warm, stress-factory welcome to my good friend, Bobo.  Let him hear it.  How'd you get from Bobo, everybody?  Pause that.  Pause that. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Pause that.  That's the first...  We have to dissect this.  Now, back that up a little bit.  That's hysterical.  The first douche chill that you get in this video.  The first douche chill is who's on stage right now.  Yeah, Vinny.  Yeah, Vinny.  Someone said to me last night, wow, he's getting shorter and shorter.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait a second about Vinny.  I'm headlining the show and he's the host.  Yeah.  He did about 40 minutes, 45, as the host.  I know.  I'm not lying.  So I went on stage, I go, it's good to be here headlining on Vinny's show. 
[00:07:30]  And I told him next time I headline there, why don't you just have me fucking host it  and you close.  Yeah, and you do the fucking show.  And I'm not saying what he does is horrific.  What I'm saying is...  What I'm saying is the time...  And you can't talk to him and reason with him because he's fucking deaf, right?  He's deaf, right?  And it's his club.  Right.  So he kills, too.  Like, the crowd...  They love him.  Well, because it's almost like a pep rally.  I mean, his material, when he does stand-up, he is a funny guy. 
[00:08:00]  I'm serious.  But when he's hosting, it's like a fucking pep rally.  Who's birthday?  Who's this?  Who's that?  Let's make a phone call.  Go fuck yourself and bring me on stage, okay?  Yeah, he kills in front of you.  Makes it harder for you guys.  The middle act...  Well, one, there was a guest spot.  This little Asian girl on Thursday, and I had a guest spot.  She was a little...  No, she was a hottie.  Not even funny, but hot.  And she did a guest spot.  It was...  I felt...  I didn't feel bad for her at all.  It was kind of funny to watch her fucking eat it. 
[00:08:30]  Bomb.  Bomb.  But she looked good.  She looked good.  And then on Saturday, the middle act, I forget his name, who has energy.  He's running around.  People mix up energy.  They try to think energy is humor.  It's funny.  It's funny.  Right, right.  All right?  We'll go to a fucking marathon.  We want to see somebody run.  Tell a fucking joke.  All right.  I got to get to the video, Rich.  I don't even know what you're talking about right now.  That's great.  Yeah, that was kind of good.  So, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  This video...  I warned everybody that if you don't like to be uncomfortable, do not click on this video.  Because this thing is just so uncomfortable.  And the first uncomfortable moment, the first douche chill comes with Bobo making his way  to the stage.  He's got his hands up in the air.  Like, he's got to high-five everyone on the way to the stage like Dane Cook would do.  Name some of these people that have to high-five because...  Every wrestler in the business.  Wrestlers.  Yeah.  Phil Mickelson at the U.S. Open was high-fiving in between holes because there's so many fans 
[00:09:30]  and they just need to touch this person.  So, Bobo's walking through the crowd with his hands up in the air trying to get high-fives.  He sort of got won just as he was stepping up on the stage.  Sort of.  He thought it was just going to be this barrage of hands like, oh, I wish I could get to  all the hands.  There's going to be disappointed people because I didn't high-five them.  It was like he was sitting on a convertible at a ticker-tay parade.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, they're all going to start throwing confetti at them.  Yeah, hey, hey, hey.  All right. 
[00:10:00]  Let's see that moment.  We're a performer on the Opie and Anthony radio show all the way from Queens, New York.  Please give me a loud, warm, stress-factory welcome to my good friend, Bobo.  Let him hear it.  Let's go to Bobo, everybody.  Hands in the air.  Can't find one high-five.  He stopped.  He stopped.  Hold on.  Wait.  Evening New Jersey.  There's Bobo on stage.  How many of you here screwed over a stockholder to come here tonight? 
[00:10:30]  Come on.  I know.  I watch CNN.  I know what's been going on.  Well, first, I'd like to introduce to you, you know him from the Opie and Anthony show.  Pause, pause.  Stop.  What, Ritz?  First of all, his intro is his address.  Yeah, yeah.  You might recognize this guy if you were in Queens one day.  And then, you know what it is also?  The first of all, I'd like to introduce, no, that's the last thing you do. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  You're bringing up the headliner.  So, not first of all, I want to bring up Rich Voss.  But he's watched a lot of stand-up because, like, he looks like a comic.  If you had the audio down, you'd go, okay, this guy must be a comic that's kind of traveling around.  Yeah, yeah.  Trying to make it.  He's the goofy guy, like, act.  Yeah, he's very confident.  He holds the mic right.  Yeah, he's sitting there.  He's holding the mic.  So, the stockbroker bit really didn't work.  That's okay. 
[00:11:30]  But you'd think he would build, and maybe his second one that he never did.  Well, we got this.  He introduced you for the early and the late.  Yeah.  This is the introducing you for the early.  When he introduced you for the late, he went a lot longer.  Oh, yeah, he did some time.  Well, he went in the back.  Him and his, you know, he wrote.  Oh, he wrote some stuff?  And then he completely muffed his stockbroker line.  Well, he muffed the Voss line, too, which is coming up.  Yeah.  Here we go.  First of all, how many of you here screwed over a stockholder to come here tonight?  Come on, I know. 
[00:12:00]  I watch CNN.  I know what's been going on.  Well, first, I'd like to introduce to you, you know him from the O.P. and Anthony show.  He's the Jew with the right amount of stupidity and the horse of a smile.  Give it up for a New Jersey's own Rich Foss.  The horse of a smile.  What is he saying?  But wait, when a guy that's semi-mental calls you, calls me stupid, what is that?  How fucking dumb am I?  In his eyes, he thinks he's smarter than me. 
[00:12:30]  He listens to the show.  I guess it's supposed to be the smile of a horse, which even that doesn't really make sense.  But he said the horse of a smile.  What the fuck is he trying to say?  That's a horse of a different color.  Yeah.  That's a horse of a smile.  It's amazing.  If you look at that shot, you're thinking, hey, like you said, he's a comic.  Yeah, there he is.  He's a comic.  He's a comic.  Look at that.  All right, continue with the ball. 
[00:13:00]  His mannerisms and everything is all, you got to see this video, by the way, if you're  listening, because his mannerisms, he's like, hand on the mic, other hand on the mic.  He's, his body language is hysterical.  He looks like he belongs up there.  Yeah.  Study comedy.  He's like a guy that studies it like Bibiglia.  They study it and they learn how to do it.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  You know him from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  He's the Jew with the right amount of stupidity and the horse of a smile.  Give it up for New Jersey's own Rich Foss. 
[00:13:30]  And he stands there, waiting, gives Rich the, he wanted to give Rich the high five.  And hey, bring your, you know him from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All the way from Queens, New York, please put your hands together for the one and only  Bobo, everybody.  Let him hear it.  Put your hands together.  Hey, hold on a second.  He didn't walk with his hands up looking for high fives?  No, he knew not to try for the high five that time.  He does learn, though. 
[00:14:00]  He's a fast learner.  He knows how to learn.  And he put on his Mets coat.  He didn't have that on before.  Yep, yep.  Because he's thinking, I'm going to get the late show Mets fans on my side.  No, he thought he was going to intro you and get the fuck out of there.  Pick up his gig money and leave.  And just get out.  Get his half a sandwich and leave.  Yeah, and just leave.  Did Vinny pay him?  Huh?  Did Vinny fucking pay him?  I have no idea.  Vinny better have paid him.  He better have made a couple of Bobo bucks.  I'm sure he didn't.  A couple of Bobo bucks.  I shouldn't say that. 
[00:14:30]  Bobo's broke.  You know how much money he spent to get to Vinny's club?  Vinny better have given up some money.  I think Vinny charged him to get in.  Probably.  Probably.  Good evening, New Jersey.  All right, who's here from Queens?  Who do we got here from Queens?  Me.  Me.  I'm from Queens.  Oh, we got my relatives here.  We got my cousin, Mikey, who grew up in the same neighborhood as me.  He's now in Spintown, Old Violet.  He managed to make it out here from the shitty L.A.E. traffic along with, let's see, we got 
[00:15:00]  here in my, if you're, if my uncle Willie, from Flushing, he made it out of your shitty  traffic out of L.A.E.  Believe me, it's shitty, don't you?  You don't know the Long Island Expressway.  It's very shitty.  The traffic, the traffic I need.  He's giving a traffic report.  That's what I, I think I said that.  I said, when I walked out, I go, thank you for the Long Island traffic report.  That's what I said. 
[00:15:30]  Exactly what I said.  But, after the show, you know his relatives were saying, in front of people, you don't  say you're related to us.  Not say you even know me.  You know me.  God bless them, though.  They went all the way to the stress factory to see their kid mobile.  You got to introduce everybody.  How many people did he bring?  I wonder if they got comped.  Hell no.  Fuck no.  I'm sorry, you haven't reached your drink minimum.  Have to leave.  When he said, this is my Uncle Willie. 
[00:16:00]  If you could picture what he was looking at in his mind, was a cock coming out of somebody's  hands?  Continuing with the Bobo video.  Who here came out here to screw over the income?  Who screwed over his stockholder?  Oh, we got one that screwed over his stockholder.  I think you're probably going to end up having to get that anal rape by Bernie Nadoff.  Why?  A lot of people know I do that. 
[00:16:30]  The two fat pigs get up and leave.  There's people in the way of the camera now that are getting up to leave.  Because you know what?  You know what that's all about?  We've all been at a comic club and you're like, oh, fuck.  Vinny just did 45 minutes.  I got to take a leak.  But I've heard about this Bobo character or I've heard of this comedian.  I got to sit through this.  And then you realize, oh, no, I can take a leak.  This is the equivalent of the drum solo at a concert.  Oh, we're not going to miss anything.  I can take a piss. 
[00:17:00]  I can grab a beer.  Let's run to the bathroom before Rich Voss hits the stage.  This is Black Oak, Arkansas playing in front of Humble Pie.  These two girls were sitting up front and they had little crowns on and it was their birthday.  And they were humongous.  And I go, and I don't think I said it, but I could have.  You guys just wanted another excuse to eat cake because they were gigantic beasts.  And they had these like plastic crowns.  And I go, you don't need anything else to draw attention to your disgustingness. 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  Oh, shit.  Unbelievable.  I can't build a fan base.  I'm too mean.  Who are you two?  Burger Queens?  Fucking crowns.  I can't wait to use that.  Wow, you're bringing the heifers because then the two, that's not the same two girls, right?  Two fatties got up and now two fatties are sitting down.  Oh, wow.  I'm bringing the heifers, the real biggums.  It was the biggums show. 
[00:18:00]  It was the biggums.  Rich gets a huge audience.  It was the biggums convention in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  This crowd.  I did it.  Oh, we got one that's screwed over a stockholder.  I think you're probably going to end up having to get that anal rape by Bernie Nadoff.  A lot of people know I do that little Bobo Springsteen bit, so...  A lot of people know I do that Bobo Springsteen bit. 
[00:18:30]  First of all, you little shit, you ripped my bit off.  Right.  It's Anthony's bit.  And secondly, I don't think a lot of people do know that you do the Bobo Springsteen bit.  But in his mind, that fucking bit is sweeping America.  Oh, it's done.  I'm done with it.  I lost out.  He's this close from getting a call from Lorne Michaels to do it on SNL.  Oh, I know.  This close.  Dude, I...  I love this kid because he has all the confidence in the world.  I'm going to be the guy that goes, that was my bit.  Right.  That was my bit.  Oh, yeah.  Right, right. 
[00:19:00]  It's Bobo.  Bobo does that bit.  Actually, a lot of people know I do that little Bobo Springsteen bit, so...  Who here is from Jersey?  He's got an interesting job.  Now, hold on.  I hate to keep stopping this, but he's now doing improv work.  He's doing improv work.  Now he's ripping off Rich Voss as well.  I'm looking for someone from Jersey.  Jersey.  All right, now give me a job.  Anyone give me an interesting job?  I'm going to put this together.  I'm working the crowd. 
[00:19:30]  I want...  All right, give me...  Location?  No, a situation.  A situation and...  He's doing fucking improv.  But you know what?  He stands on that stage and he waits it out for the perfect person.  He commands it.  He's looking over the crowd like, eh, not you.  I don't like that occupation.  I don't like that one.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  The whole time he's holding his drool in.  Oh, my God.  He's a fucking guy, man. 
[00:20:00]  He's fantastic.  But the way he's pointing, like, hmm.  Yeah.  All right, I'm looking at, like, yeah, like you're watching some fucking improv show.  Okay, we're here in Jersey.  Who here is from Jersey?  Because I know most of you are Rhode Island people.  Yes, yes.  It's the Stress Factory in Jersey.  In the heart of Jersey, who would be from Jersey, except for my family and Uncle Willie  that are in from Queens.  All right, Uncle Willie and his penis.  All right, go.  Booger Couch from Arkansas. 
[00:20:30]  I really didn't want to say this, but I'm thinking the same thing, Booger Couch is, but  now I have to.  He writes, the funny thing is that Bobo's family is in the crowd because they think he's a real  talent, but he's really popular with your show because he's half a retard.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus.  It's a little, um.  But the family had, you know.  Harsh.  All the family knows is, wow.  Hey, Booger Couch.  Like, what's he doing?  He's doing gigs at comedy clubs? 
[00:21:00]  He's on radio shows?  What the fuck?  How did we miss this?  You could hear the gulps from that corner of the room as they went, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Now I see what the deal is.  I had to find out in front of 400 people.  Oh, my God.  I get it.  It's at him.  Not with him.  I haven't had 400 people in three years.  I was pumping up your number.  That's what I do.  The brilliance.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, let's hit that up there.  Oh, Booger Springsteen, bitch.  So, who here is from Jersey?  He's got an interesting job.  Let me see.  Let me see.  He's got a good job.  You reckon?  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  Wait, he's still seeing his green.  Wait, he's a new blue business. 
[00:22:00]  He's got a big four-gustle-bunner rocket.  He's got a jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  A smattering.  A smattering of applause.  For his big bit.  For his giant, huge bit.  That's his closer.  That's his benchmark bit.  And he gets.  You know, that's just like watching Brian Regan do, the big yellow one is the thug.  Exactly.  Dude, that's his huge bit. 
[00:22:30]  Wait, that was his bit.  I thought he was just mimicking the girl.  No.  No, no.  That's his bit.  You don't know that's his bit.  But he didn't do enough of it.  And he.  There's so much wrong with that.  Injury.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That table is a father with three daughters.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Coming to my show.  Don't people do research?  Who?  He didn't get lambashed.  Is that the word? 
[00:23:00]  Lambashed?  Yeah, lambashed.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  We'll add that to the Wikipedia.  Yeah, just fucking write that one down.  Jesus.  In lieu of lambasted.  Or lambasted.  Or lambasted.  It's on the door now?  Yeah.  Wow.  Once we discovered it, we put it up on the door so Rich can go over there and write his  editions himself.  It's halfway down the door.  Explain for the new listeners that didn't hear this one there, Iraq.  We have a list composed of every time that Rich has screwed up a pronunciation on this  show. 
[00:23:30]  And the door is almost full.  And it's a pretty small type.  Yeah, it goes from the top.  Single space.  Three quarters down.  Lambashed?  Lambased.  Lambased.  There you go.  Lambased.  Now you got lambashed.  I like lambashed.  I do too.  Ma!  Ow!  Lambashing.  All right, let's finish up the Bobo video.  The tree!  The new little businesses.  He's done it to me.  Work on some kind of rocket. 
[00:24:00]  He proved your words in it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Then he waits.  Without further ado, give it up.  For the guy who has the right amount of stupidity and has a horse-like smile, New Jersey's own  Rich Voss.  Fucking Bobo.  Then he stands there.  He stands there kind of rocking back and forth all awkwardly waiting for Rich to come up. 
[00:24:30]  Fucking Bobo.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  He waits for a laugh like my two-year-old daughter does.  Did you see that?  My two-year-old daughter does something, and we laugh, and then she'll do it again.  Uh-huh.  And it was almost the same type of feeling I got watching him wait for a laugh.  Where he just sat there and waited.  Waited.  And actually, my two-year-old gets more laughs.  Of course.  Your two-year-old's smarter than me.  Unbelievable.  And this is Vinny with his camera. 
[00:25:00]  He can't show one or two minutes of me knowing that this will be played on the radio?  Yeah, perhaps.  Perhaps maybe.  No, we got all that.  No, well, don't show it then.  No, we got all that.  We cut it out.  Oh, okay.  It was about Bobo, you freak.  Well, I smashed it.  It was a Bobo video.  Well, I did a good line about Bobo and the traffic and stuff after it.  And him getting up and walking out during the second show, all of a sudden he stands up  and he's got his coat and I go, are you leaving, Bobo?  I already saw you the first show.  Yeah.  I already saw you. 
[00:25:30]  He said that?  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  I already saw you.  He was done.  Not a problem.  You know, I guess he had another engagement early in the morning or something.  There's another comedy club he has to get to.  I know how you comedians are.  You go from club to club to club.  Gigs.  He's got gigs.  He has more gigs.  His driver was probably waiting out, you know, in the driveway.  If you, uh, the video.  Once again, the video, if you go to my Twitter, it's the easiest way, Opie Radio.  I mean, you got to start following our Twitters because we don't have a website right now 
[00:26:00]  and we're doing a lot of visual behind the scenes stuff.  Oh, yeah.  So I'm Opie Radio and Anthony's Anthony Cumia.  Yes.  C-U-M-I-A.  It's very easy.  Anthony Cumia.  And, uh, you know, you'll be, uh, you'll be well informed with what's going on on the show  and when we're not on the air.  Simple as that.  And I had three hours of fun and hijinks, uh, last night, just, um, on, you know, online.  Doing your thing.  Yeah.  Doing my thing that I can't really.  Doing my thing that I can't really.  We're not allowed to talk about, which is.  Which is hysterical.  Which is ridiculous because, uh.  With everything else but them.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Only.  Ah.  Yeah.  We're off to a good start.  Oh, hold on.  We're off to a good start.  I'm red flagging.  Okay.  No, no.  All I'll say is this.  Red flag.  All I'll say is this.  I think you.  All right.  Yeah.  Keep it like that.  Keep it right here.  You go red if I'm going too far with this.  Why do we get in trouble?  She just red flagged him.  Why do we get in trouble for wanting to do more for our listeners?  That just is mind boggling to me.  It really is.  This company actually sat us down and said, Ant, you can't do this or you can't promote this. 
[00:27:00]  I see what you're doing, but you can only do this, this, and this, but we don't want you doing this, this, and this.  Don't promote it.  And it's like there's no other show in this building that is doing so much extra shit for the fans and the listeners.  Off the air and not for profit.  And we just assumed that they'd be happy.  It would help the listening experience.  It would bring more subs into SiriusXM.  Exactly.  They actually sat us down and said, no, no, we don't want you to do an extra credit. 
[00:27:30]  I have proof.  It's amazing to me.  I have proof that some of my extracurricular activities has gotten people to subscribe.  Oh, yeah.  To this program.  They don't understand that gray area.  It's like, why wouldn't people that enjoy what me and Opie are doing off the air by using the technology available today?  There's a lot of technology available for keeping your audience kind of, you know, interested. 
[00:28:00]  And why is that a bad thing?  I'll never understand the logic behind it.  You name one other show that's doing all that extra shit behind the scenes.  And for no money.  Let me tell you something.  For no fucking money.  It's at a cost.  Believe me.  It's at a fucking, I pay to do things off the air to, you know, keep the fans involved.  I will never be able to wrap my arms around that one.  I can't fucking for the life of me get an answer. 
[00:28:30]  The other thing, we've been at this 14 years, and for the most part, and I'm talking very general, obviously, because the real faithful listeners know the difference.  But you and I have been looked at as basically twins for the last 14 years.  Yeah, yeah.  And in the last six months to somewhere within the last year, we've decided to, like, push ourselves out there individually as well.  Yeah.  Which is interesting to the hardcore fans.  Like, oh, Opie's into this.  Ant's into this.  Oh, look what he's doing when they're not doing the show together. 
[00:29:00]  A little individual personality.  Which makes it, you know, the listening experience that much better, too.  Yeah, because then you listen to the show, and you realize, you know.  But they actually sat us down and said, what the fuck is this about?  And lawyers got involved, and we're like, why do they get involved when we're trying to do more for our listeners?  Do they have a department that's pushing, like, a publicity, you know what I mean?  That internet marketing department.  No, they don't, they just.  No one would be able to do and support what we do on our own. 
[00:29:30]  No one.  It just, they wouldn't, there wouldn't be that much energy put into it.  Right.  You know?  You know how we're doing all this extra stuff for his listeners?  We decide we want to do all this extra stuff, and we get literally spanked for it.  And the reason is because it's a gray area.  Like, they can't really look at a chart and go, well, Ant's podcast has brought this many listeners to SiriusXM.  You can't really come up with a number, so that scares people. 
[00:30:00]  When it's just an overall gray area thing that you just know helps the show and helps the amount of people signing up for SiriusXM.  Yeah.  It's just something you just know.  You just know, but you can't, you can't get charts out and go, well, this is, you know, Ope's videos are bringing this many people to SiriusXM.  Ant's podcast is bringing this many people to, you know, SiriusXM.  I haven't broken it down to a graph that I can then submit to, you know, people.  If we could do that, then they would allow it. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  They just got to assume that it's working, it's helping, and don't worry about it.  We've been at this a long time.  Yeah.  We understand.  This is very good.  We understand what we're doing.  When no one is doing this kind of thing, there aren't radio personnel, every radio personality that does something is doing it and charging for it, making a profit, whatever it is.  We're just doing this because we've always used the technology of the day to keep in touch with the fans and do extra stuff just for the fuck of it. 
[00:31:00]  Because, strangely enough, we actually enjoy doing this shit.  Mm-hmm.  So, that's why we do it.  And then we just kind of get fucking problems.  We're part of the SiriusXM app for free.  Yeah, yeah.  The other show, he needs a payday.  I guess.  I don't know what the deal is there.  We did it because it's helping the company and it's helping our show.  I love the fucking SiriusXM app.  It's amazing.  I use it all the time.  It's one of the most popular apps right now also as far as downloads go. 
[00:31:30]  Number two?  Very popular, yeah.  But the haters out there, the world of the hater has to end soon because it's just getting ridiculous.  It is getting harder for them to hate.  But SiriusXM, the app is number two.  The number one app is some kind of like game.  You know because you've got the iPhone.  What is it?  Like a waste basket game?  Throw it in the basket.  Where you throw, what do you do?  You throw like paper balls? 
[00:32:00]  Stupid games are always number one.  So the haters are like, oh, yeah, well, they always have to find a problem.  Well, yeah, it's the number two app, but the one that's beating them is a dumb game where you throw balls of paper in a wastebasket.  Yeah.  That proves that the company's failing.  Exactly.  It's still number two.  Those are the apps that really get, you'll see, the most popular apps are games.  I mean, all the time, games.  To have a tech app like the SiriusXM one even be at number two is amazing. 
[00:32:30]  A lot of people checking it out, though.  I think we're getting a lot of listeners off of this app.  Yeah, I do, too.  Off of this app.  I do, too.  Really cool.  So big hi to everyone that's listening on the SiriusXM app.  All right.  Enough of bitching.  That's it for today.  That's all the bitching we do.  I can solve your problem.  Send them a bill.  Yeah.  Send them a bill.  Oh, they already owe me money for marketing.  I'm the new consultant for SiriusXM.  He dubbed himself consultant.  I think if entertainers ran show business, it would do a lot better.  Travis, you got that. 
[00:33:00]  You got it here.  I'm a consultant now.  He's looking for it.  He's looking for that.  If you knew how much I'm spending.  Today, I'm getting a new piece of hardware for my phones because my phones seem to feed back a little too much because I want a little cheap with the hybrid device.  So I get a new phone system, Gizmo.  If you know what I paid for this fucking thing, just for the fuck of it.  Oh, I know.  Just so I could do this.  A lot of the equipment.  It was ridiculous, but it was because I wanted it to look and sound good and everything like that. 
[00:33:30]  When I take a peek at your podcast, I mean, we have to be able to talk about it from time to time.  It's almost like a post game.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  That's what I like about your podcast.  All of a sudden, someone will call out, Will, so you had whatever.  I don't know.  Whatever.  But I give a little insight on.  Oh, so you had Hammer on.  You know, how was he?  You know, off mic or whatever it would be.  And you're like doing a little post game like you get after a baseball game or something.  Something like that. 
[00:34:00]  If somebody was taking a video, you know, pop that up on the screen behind me and kind of dissect it a little bit.  Yeah.  Tell what was going on.  And then take a phone call about some guy that's fucking, you know, fucking his chick in the ass and can't come unless he, you know, puts it in a mouth afterward.  I mean, it's all over the place, but it's one of those things that's just fun to do.  Absolutely.  It gets listeners, and most of the people are subscribers anyway.  I don't know.  It's just beyond me.  You know, my little bit that I decided to do on my own with my own hard-earned money. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  That's all I could say.  They don't want me promoting it.  I'm like it has nothing to do with you guys.  Yeah.  They don't want me promoting it.  I have said it's not a Opie and Anthony contest, has nothing to do with SiriusXM, and even if I say that and then explain what it is, I get in trouble.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  It's my fucking money.  What do you want me to sign?  I'd love to be able to promote. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Amazing.  Oh, well.  This guy writes, hey, Opie, you mean you can't promote your Sunset Twitter project?  I've been a fan of the Sunset for very, for the Sunset Twitter project.  Opie, here's another Sunset.  That's great.  I kind of like when the sun's going down.  I don't know why.  I think if not, I'll tell you why, because it brings me back to, I'll get semi-serious for a moment.  My grandma had a beach house in Waiting River, and as kids, we, at the end of a long day of playing wiffle ball and fishing and doing whatever the fuck, 
[00:35:30]  we'd hang out and watch the Sunset as a family, an extended family.  I said I was getting serious for a moment.  And while you were doing that, who was up in the attic?  Boo!  Oh, no, she, she, no, whatever.  Don't wreck my moment with that.  I'll save that for later.  Oh, that's, that's a beautiful, little Opie is, is, is coming out right now. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  No.  In the Sunset.  Go fuck yourself.  You're like, that's sweet, though.  Oh, is that one of your sunsets?  Yeah.  That's very nice.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you.  It looks like a nuclear explosion over Jersey.  I know.  A nuclear explosion over Jersey.  Whoa, whoa.  It looks like a shot from like a $5 million penthouse.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Look, you know what?  It's a helicopter.  It's a helicopter.  If you know the right people, you can get on some of the roofs of these buildings.  This is where Opie was flying onto his helipad. 
[00:36:30]  Shut up.  I'm a very private person, unlike the guy to my right.  Yeah, he was willing to just throw everything out there.  Yeah, I guess if you do.  To show every inch of his house.  I know.  What an asshole.  The fans have officially seen part of my front door.  That's it.  And, let me think.  And out a window, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe.  You know what?  I do.  When I look at that, I think of like five little boys standing in Long Island, the waves 
[00:37:00]  smashing.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  The ones holding the bat.  The ones holding the ball.  They just had some nice little ball playing.  And now they're going to walk back to their house of pure dysfunction.  That's what I see when I see that.  You know what?  My grandma kept me sane, my friend.  Yeah.  Hell fucking yeah.  My grandparents.  She picked up a lot of slack.  Do you know how hard it was when my grandparents.  I never.  All right.  And then I got boobies.  All right.  Look.  See?  You know something. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Then you got boobies.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I look at that.  When I see five kids standing on a beach and a girl walks by.  When I see that, I see five kids that are starving.  It shouldn't be.  Oh, who is that?  That's a pet of the year, 2007.  We liked her a lot.  Her name's Heather.  I always forget her last name.  Heather what?  She was cool.  Van Der Van?  Van Der Van?  And the pictures do her face no justice.  I don't know what happened when those pictures were saps.  Because our lighting in here sucks. 
[00:38:00]  She was very cute and everything.  And if we're going to keep going visual with our show,  we got to get better lighting in the studio.  Yeah.  These fluorescent lights are just killing a lot of our pictures.  I'll bring some in from my basement.  Apparently, I got eight billion watts of lighting down there.  Yeah.  So your grandmother basically raised you or that was your-  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Because that would piss off my mom.  Well, when we grew up, I grew up-  I was out at Waiting River in the summertime every weekend, easily,  with my entire family, all my cousins, uncles, aunts. 
[00:38:30]  You want to talk about a good fucking time.  A lot of drinking going on and smoking.  I don't know what happened with my aunts and uncles.  They all were raging alcoholics and smoked their asses off,  and none of them smoke anymore, and they barely drink.  Weird.  Mine, it's the same thing.  Really?  They don't drink or smoke anymore either because they're dead.  Because they drank and smoked.  My grandmother, I used to play.  We used to play, like, down the block.  It was an all-black neighborhood.  And, like, me and my brother were, like, the white kids. 
[00:39:00]  Must have really fit in.  It was like the-  You know, because we lived on the corner house, and in the front of the house,  on the front were the white people, basically.  You were the border.  And in the back were the black people.  And I felt like I wasn't good enough to hang with the white people, you know,  because divorce family.  And in the back, well, I was a little better, I felt then.  So I hung with the black kids, right?  And we lived above my grandparents for free on the second floor, and they had a three-family  house, right?  So we lived on the second floor for free.  So we played down the block with the black kids, and there might have been one or two 
[00:39:30]  other white kids.  And my grandmother, who was, like, 80 years old or 70, whatever.  Oh, no.  When the streetlights came on, would come walking down the street in her nightgown with her stockings  down to her ankle.  You know how old people?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With a cigarette, and you could see the ash was, like, a mile long.  Richard, Robert, come in.  And all the black kids, they would torture us. 
[00:40:00]  Why wouldn't they?  The white kids would have.  You know, with this old lady walking down the street, and here I'm scared that she's  going to get murdered or praying, you know, that just would happen.  And it just ruined my fucking life right from the beginning.  I didn't have a chance.  Yeah.  I thank everybody in my family.  Obviously, I see what happened.  And they're calling me the sunset whisperer.  Fuckers.  Another sunset.  You know what I'm doing?  All right, fuckers. 
[00:40:30]  Last night's sunset.  I'm fucking tweeting it right now, you motherfuckers.  Now I'm saying a sunset picture every day.  Now that's what you get.  That's what you get.  As part.  All right.  Why don't we take a break as I type this out?  So whatever.  Whatever.  We just know what we're doing, and you guys should just let us do whatever the fuck we  want.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  Rich, what are you promoting before we hit break here?  Oh, I'm at the Treehouse in Stratford, Connecticut, July 11th. 
[00:41:00]  It's supposed to be a good club.  And August 1st, Mardi Gras, Bar and Grill in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Yeah.  Mardi Gras.  Yeah, I can't wait for that.  That and then a three-day golf tournament after it.  You want to see these gay pants I just ordered?  You have to see them.  After the break.  Okay.  That's a great tease.  That's beautiful.  We've got to talk about Beth Page Black for like two minutes after the break.  Okay.  I'll explain in a second.  Steve might be sick tomorrow.  Really?  Well, remember yesterday?  Did you get the email? 
[00:41:30]  Well, remember yesterday?  Of course.  He's sniffling and coughing a little bit.  He's got like cold medicine.  And he's got props now.  Yeah, he's got like products around his computer.  Yeah, there are various cold medications around there.  I think they're empty.  I don't even think they're real.  They're like fake names.  You ever go to a model house to see things and they have the fake TV up there that's made of cardboard?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so that's what it is.  It's all.  Look, it's Tylenol cold. 
[00:42:00]  He's got some separate.  That would make you drowsy, wouldn't it?  Wouldn't it?  Advil.  The Tylenol cold medicine?  Yeah, it's very drowsy.  Advil, like you said, sorry.  Sepacol?  Yeah, Sepacol.  Sepacol, sorry.  Java Monster Energy Drinks.  He's gearing up to say, I don't feel well.  I'm taking the day.  Every other one's the medicine divided by the energy drink.  It looks almost like what an ad agency would do.  It's a poor man's speedball right there. 
[00:42:30]  Thank you.  I was about to say it's a speedball.  Because the Tylenol cold is going to make you drowsy.  That's like the heroin.  The monster is going to pick you right the fuck up.  Yeah.  What the fuck is he doing?  Sweating.  Sweating.  And he wonders why he's sweating.  Sweating profusely.  Everyone is freaked out by his sweat.  Why are you sweating?  I had eight Java Monsters and some coffee.  It leads to backstage with Sam Roberts because he got to the bottom of Steve and his fake sick days.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[00:43:00]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and it was brought up on the O.B. and Anthony show that executive producer Steve C.  is faking sick and taking days off like there's no tomorrow.  We went to Steve himself to get to the bottom of things.  Steve, the guys say that you take too many sick days.  What's going on?  I know you think I'm faking it, but believe me, it would be a lot easier just to call out than to fucking orchestrate an elaborate scheme. 
[00:43:30]  Why is your immune system so weak?  AIDS.  Do you think you're taking more sick days than anybody else?  Not at all.  No more sick days than anyone else?  Apparently, O.B. and Anthony's opinion of the days Steve takes off are skewed.  We found the O.B. and Anthony interns and asked all of them who takes the most sick days.  Who do you think takes the most sick days out of the O&A staff?  So far, definitely Steve.  I think Steve.  That would be Steve Carleese. 
[00:44:00]  Probably Steve.  I'd say Steve.  Um, Steve?  I would say probably Steve Carleese.  A room full of idiot interns can't be wrong.  Why is Steve faking sick every day?  Has the pressure finally gotten to him?  Luckily for us, Steve being absent from the show has literally no effect on how it sounds.  Feel better, Steve.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with O.N.A. 
[00:44:30]  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Shoup.  Lots going on in the sports world.  How are your Yankees doing, Ant?  Uh, well, they did win.  Uh, they broke that three-game losing streak.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, A-Rod, uh, he, uh, uh, uh, had a nice couple of ribbies, I guess.  He's having a horrendous year, right?  Ah, the Yankees are on the whole.  But he came back from a pretty serious injury.  Yeah.  Is it true he's batting, like, I heard 2-0-9 going into last night's game? 
[00:45:00]  Wow, really?  Is that possible?  It could be.  They've, uh, they've been sucking, um, offensively.  I just mean A-Rod in general.  That 2-0-9, there's no way that's...  They've been offensive offensively.  That can't be right.  Travis, look that up for me, will ya?  Uh, reports are out that the Vikings have come to contractual agreement with Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  I don't know why they're excited about that.  When we got him down here... 
[00:45:30]  Oh, goodness gracious!  Brett Favre's back!  The Jets fans, uh, in general were goodness gracious.  I was like, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Over the hill guy.  And he's gonna go sign, he's signing with the Vikings now?  Yeah, with a bad arm.  Well, why don't, listen, either retire or not.  These people that, you know...  It's hard when they're saying, hey, you wanna make another $10 million or whatever the fuck it would be?  How do you say no to that?  Well, he's got...  When's enough enough?  I mean...  When they stop paying you $10 million a year. 
[00:46:00]  Really?  Yeah, apparently so.  You think he's getting that much money, $10 million bucks, to play one year after his last performance?  I don't know what the number would be, but it's gonna be impressive.  By the way, look, I don't need no stinking fucking...  What?  I don't need no app.  It's just, like, hardcore fucking...  Why am I looking at hardcore...  I mean, I don't mind, obviously, but why am I looking at hardcore porn on your iPhone?  You guys are...  Well, there's, like, apps, I guess, out there somewhere.  Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  This is a foreign piece of equipment.  You guys are like Goofus and Gallant.  Goofus has hardcore porn on his phone.  Gallant has sunsets.  He has so many beautiful sunsets.  I think he's gonna come out with a book of sunsets.  Well, I could very easily.  You could easily come out with a book.  I mean, don't put your name on it.  That'll sell 20 or 30 copies.  No, I'll tell you what's going on with my Twitter and stuff.  I don't know how far he could go.  Like, I go to some people's Twitters, and they got hardcore porn. 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  Dude, I got some shit I want to put on my Twitter.  You don't know.  And I got some videos that I'm scared to upload.  And I don't want to upload them to some X-rated site, because, you know, they get buried in those sites.  On Twitter, you could send pictures, too?  On Twitter?  You're kidding.  Oh, my God.  For real?  Rich.  Did you send pictures?  Rich.  Just before he came back on, Rich goes, I'm so behind.  Yeah, you really are.  You don't know you could send a picture on Twitter?  I don't know.  You know what?  Twitter was cool at first when people started going, hey, I'm going to Starbucks. 
[00:47:30]  I'm going to Subway.  I'm doing this.  I'm banging this hot chick.  I'm blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's all boring now.  Yep.  If you're sending a tweet without a pic, it better be some good-ass fucking philosophy you're writing down.  And seriously, and if you don't know the  abbreviations like you do, the twit without the pic and all that shit, you're not even  in the game.  What are you talking about?  I mean, what do you call it?  You know what I'm saying.  No, I don't.  No, no.  I have no idea, but I know it's going to be up on the list on the door.  90% of my tweets.  Abbreviations.  Yeah, like he said pic instead of pictures. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  You're kidding, right?  What?  What happened to Snapshot?  You're kidding, right?  No, that's what you said.  You've never heard pic before?  Yeah, I've heard it, but I'm saying when you're using it.  We've been using the word pic for 10 years easy.  Easy.  Here's my favorite part of the iPhone, by the way.  I just zoomed in on that, but watch this.  I can then, using two fingers, I can spread that open and look.  I could get just giant vats. 
[00:48:30]  Here's my new fucking screen saver.  That is an ultra close.  I could get even closer.  That is the ultra close up.  Let me see that.  And why isn't the quality of a vag?  Why don't you lose quality?  Because it's a high-res picture.  You know what a high-res is?  High-resolution.  Oh, very good.  Bonnie yells at me.  High-restitution.  Bonnie yelled at me because I said, oh, look, Raina's going down the sliding board. 
[00:49:00]  She goes, it's a sliding board, right?  No, it's called a slide.  A sliding board.  You go down a sliding board.  No, you go down a slide.  Slide in pond.  The slide in pond?  No one's ever called it that.  I swear.  Slide in pond?  Yeah, or a sliding pond.  Slide in pond.  You don't call it a sliding board.  She's right.  It's a slide.  It's just a slide.  The kid is going down the slide.  Down the slide.  So it's my career.  All right. 
[00:49:30]  So the Vikings look like they picked up Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  This is huge.  I did not know this until literally two minutes ago.  The Suns trade Shaq to the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Holy shit.  LeBron.  Him and LeBron.  That's right, Anthony.  Even though you said Kobe during the break.  I know.  I can't get that Kobe off my mind.  Shaq over the hill.  But you got a big guy in the middle like that.  Freeze up LeBron a little bit. 
[00:50:00]  This could be the missing piece they need for that NBA championship.  Yeah.  Before the Knicks grab LeBron James.  Isn't the Shaqster getting up there, though?  Yeah.  Been around for a while?  Yeah.  I mean, this is pretty much it for him.  He's got one, maybe two years left.  I wanted to sound like I knew something, but I heard someone say that earlier.  Yeah, but he's a monster.  And all he has to do is just, you know, be down low.  Just be there.  And LeBron.  Yes.  He's got to stand on the court.  Is that his job?  They've got to be jumping up and down in Cleveland. 
[00:50:30]  For real.  They have to be excited.  Well, we've got somebody in Cleveland.  Ooh.  Jeremy.  Oh, yes.  I am jumping up and down in Cleveland right now.  This is a good acquisition for this team.  The city excited?  Oh, yes.  We gave up some good guys.  We gave up Ben Wallace, Sasha Pavlik, and the 46th pick in Thursday's draft.  Losing.  Wallace has been around as well.  No, I'm thinking, because I do know a little bit about the NBA.  I kind of like that trade, Jeremy. 
[00:51:00]  Don't you?  Well, yeah, I do.  I just hope, you know, we can get a couple years out of this guy.  You know what?  You've got to stop right there.  Cleveland got Shaq to win the championship next year.  Not a couple years.  This is, all right, if we're going to do this, we've got to do this next year.  So they give up a few guys.  They get Shaq.  They get the championship knowing that, you know, LeBron might be leaving you guys.  So you guys should have also got three more stores on Euclid Avenue get unboarded, and 
[00:51:30]  they reopen them with that trade.  I even know that joke.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up, boss.  No, you shut up.  It is a ghost town, man.  Oh, what, are you kidding me?  It's the worst.  You want to make money?  Go to Cleveland and start selling plywood, okay?  Because everything's being boarded up.  Do you have Seat Rock?  No, we're a fucking plywood store.  Okay?  We're not building, we're boarding up.  Holy shit.  We can use your teeth.  Yeah, really good.  Yeah, okay.  Listen, your city stinks.  No, see, we think it stinks, but then you talk to these guys, they're like, no, man, 
[00:52:00]  the action has moved out of the city.  Yeah, you've got to know where to go.  See, the problem is, yeah, to Pittsburgh.  Dude, you have the same people that we do.  When we go to Cleveland, they put us up in the hotel in Zombie Town.  Yeah.  Where all the homeless people are just wandering around like zombies.  It is post-apocalyptic.  It's amazing.  And Voss isn't lying.  There's plywood all over the fucking place.  But then you talk to people like Jeremy, they go, no, man.  Where's the cool area, Jeremy?  Where?  Strongville, like the suburbs out of Cleveland where it's not a ghost town.  Yeah, they move out.  All the action has moved out to the suburbs. 
[00:52:30]  So what are they supposedly going to do with that?  Like that fake mall on Euclid Avenue?  You know what I'm talking about where you go around the circle there and that whole block,  they try to renovate it.  What's that?  It's called the Galleria.  Really?  A Galleria reminds me of nice artwork.  That's what a Galleria is.  Okay.  We're talking about that.  The only thing I can see is the homeless people sleeping in front of the place.  They're not really doing much here with anything.  This place is fucking dead.  All right.  Well, Jeremy, thanks, man.  Congrats on the Shaq thing.  I think it's great for the Cavaliers. 
[00:53:00]  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  And then another, this is big if you care about soccer.  This is huge if you care about soccer.  I heard about this.  U.S. soccer team stuns top-ranked Spain 2-zip.  First time?  Yes, that hasn't happened.  But I don't care about soccer.  I could give a shit.  But here come the soccer calls now.  The cuts beat the uncuts.  That's what happened.  That's how it works.  Yes, it was.  It was cuts two, uncuts nothing. 
[00:53:30]  The snuffleupagus.  But I guess that's really, really huge.  For soccer.  For soccer.  Which is like, all right.  No, dude, it's the fastest growing.  Shut it.  It is not.  We've explained, man.  No one really cares.  Any sport where they don't even stop the action to go to a commercial, come on.  How exciting is it really?  It takes 10 minutes to get the ball across the field.  The sport itself is saying, look, we know for the most part nothing's going to happen in the next five minutes, so just play some commercials. 
[00:54:00]  We'll be here playing.  So, basically, if you go back to high school, the girls were fucking the football players, not the soccer team.  You know, because I was on the soccer team.  Yeah.  Another point, see?  Yeah.  In soccer, everyone's equal.  That's why I hate this.  Oh, you know, soccer.  Everyone's equal.  Pele.  That's all you remember in soccer.  Who's the other guy?  The fucking broad's husband.  Beck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Beckham.  Beckham.  Beckham.  Beckham.  Beckham.  Beckham.  Beckham.  Ooh, you didn't say that. 
[00:54:30]  I know.  I had some good ones already.  Every now and then, you've got to fill a bad one in.  Yeah.  Lemons.  Lemons.  All right.  We've got Cleveland calls coming in.  Leo.  Yes.  What's up, Leo?  Hey, the reason why Cleveland is so dead is back in the 70s, they started school busing.  They would bus kids from one side of town to the other side of town.  So, like, if you lived in a neighborhood that you picked out.  You know, you picked out to live there because you liked the schools and everything. 
[00:55:00]  And here they turn around and they bus you all the way to the other side of town.  So, everybody just got pissed off and just moved and moved out of Cleveland.  So, busing had something to do with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Busing was a big thing that had to do with it.  It started back in the 70s.  I'm going to have to research that.  Just, you know, look up what the fuck happened to Cleveland.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it is a really weird...  Well, you know, the highway pretty much killed a lot of these cities there.  I would just film every movie there. 
[00:55:30]  Cleveland?  Yeah.  It's like a back lot.  It's like the Universal Studios back lot where you're just walking through and it's like,  look, it looks like a city, but it's a facade.  Yeah.  Nobody's there anymore.  It's built in one-fifth scale to look bigger.  I remember we were up there doing morning radio or maybe the virus tour or something.  Whatever.  But I remember looking out my hotel window.  It was rush hour in the morning.  Yeah.  And the streets were dead.  And I was like, wow.  A couple of homeless guys milling about.  Yeah.  It wasn't like it was like late at night or 5.30 in the morning. 
[00:56:00]  It was rush hour.  I went into the subway there for a sandwich and you had to bring your own bread, right?  Because it's so low budget.  They couldn't even...  That was a joke that didn't work.  And I sat and I planned that in my head.  Be more funny.  Bring Bobo back.  But you know what it is?  We stay in the hotels when I work there right on that road there.  Yeah.  And there's not even a restaurant to get food.  You can't like walk out and go anywhere and eat.  No, you got to go to that shitty little diner. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  To eat that one time.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  He did comedy there.  Yeah, he did comedy there.  Mongo.  Mongo the trucker.  What's up, Mongo?  We losing you, Mongo.  Mongo.  Mongo.  He makes a good point, but he wants to say, how could Favre play for the Packers' rival,  the Vikings?  Because the players don't care as much as the fans about the rivalries and all that.  That's why I wanted to be a free agent fan, remember?  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  You should be able to be a free agent fan every year.  Just like the guys you support.  It's like I'm re-signing my fandom.  To another team.  To a completely different team.  I'm going with the 49ers.  Right.  The fans care way more about the rivalries than the actual players in the end.  I mean, Brett Favre going to the Vikings.  Mongo's making a great point.  That's the Packers' fucking arch enemy.  He doesn't.  Favre has no fucking loyalty to Green Bay.  No.  He doesn't even like them anymore.  No. 
[00:57:30]  That's the reason he's going to the Vikings.  Yeah.  No shit.  He wants to beat the Packers so bad.  Absolutely.  Because what?  He felt slighted?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he proved that the Packers made a good decision there.  What did he do for the Jets?  Nothing.  Dick.  Well, but didn't he start off well with the Jets?  Like the first six or seven games?  What?  Eight games?  He was all right.  But that's what you're paying for.  That's what he's supposed to be all right.  He's just all right.  He's not paying for all right.  Well, he's not a superstar after this many years. 
[00:58:00]  You're not paying for Brett Favre, you know, the Brett Favre that was, you know, 10 years  ago or whatever.  He was just an all right quarterback.  And everyone down here in New York is so excited.  They sold so many Brett Favre jerseys.  What are all those fans doing now with those jerseys?  What the fuck are those now?  They're going to look like Awkward Guy when they go to the Jets game this fall.  They're pinning him yellow and purple.  Send him to some third world country with the Patriots Super Bowl champs shirts.  But I love Awkward Guy that goes to the game with, like, the Brett Favre jersey because, 
[00:58:30]  you know, he can't afford a New Jersey.  He's like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  You see it at every sports arena.  The jersey of the guy that's no longer with the team.  Yeah.  Fucking bought it and they got rid of him.  Fuck.  So poor guy.  Poor sport.  Poor sport.  Poor Jersey.  Yeah.  He's a poor sports jersey guy.  Literally poor.  Can't afford a New Jersey.  Yeah, Travis is right.  New Jersey.  Travis is right.  Favre is playing to beat the Packers.  That's why.  Yeah.  I understand. 
[00:59:00]  Fans are going to kill him.  Wow.  This guy has a great job in Ohio.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, yeah.  I live all the way down by the Football Hall of Fame and I drive 45 minutes to board up  the houses in Cleveland.  I just think I'm the only one out there making money.  That's one of your, that's your job?  Yeah.  I repo houses for the banks.  Matter of fact, I have two evictions today, too.  I'm on my way up to them.  What do you do?  You just kind of walk up and go get the fuck out?  In some cases, you have the sheriff and stuff with you. 
[00:59:30]  Other times, you kind of go, I don't know, you go in and just pop the locks if they're  not home or whatever and change the locks up.  Wow.  And secure the home.  Do they ever try to kick your ass?  I've got CCW, my friend.  What is that?  A weapon permit.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah, yeah.  All that scream loud enough is, I fear for my safety.  And then, as long as there's a witness around, like, you're going to be here to go.  I fear for my safety.  And you got the sheriff, too, so.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Sheriff's intent.  You know, when you're boarding, what was I going to say?  When you're boarding, like, if they're getting evicted in Cleveland, I mean, you could buy  a house there for, like, $8,000, $10,000, basically.  You know, you can get, like, something.  In Detroit, you can get houses for, like, $10,000 now.  Oh, that's wonderful, Rich.  It's a cracked neighborhood.  But these are people who are getting evicted that are growing up in that neighborhood.  What's that?  I've had realtors.  I've had realtors stand here with me offering me a house for $2,000. 
[01:00:30]  Like, you get $2,000, you take this house now.  And I'm like, I don't want it.  For $2,000?  Yeah.  How much work to remodel it?  Will you have to put, like, $40,000 into it?  Yeah, or just knock it down and own a plot of land.  That's probably best.  Yeah.  All right.  That's what they've been doing.  They've been just flattening down neighborhoods.  Fucking rats and cockroaches.  You should do that because eventually the government's going to come in and take Cleveland over and do something.  Maybe build a base.  Or you think they're just going to let it rot. 
[01:01:00]  Well, look at how they remodel Camden, which was probably one of the worst cities in the country, and they're trying to rebuild that.  Well, I like in a good neighborhood like Flint, Michigan, where everything's boarded up and just disaster.  And you should have used Newark.  Yeah.  Camden is still a shithole.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, Newark is rebuilt.  Yeah.  No, well, sort of.  They're getting there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  One stadium does not rebuild the whole city.  No, that NJ Pack. 
[01:01:30]  What were you talking about?  Camden or Newark?  Newark.  Newark.  Well, it's like comparing a bullet to a chalk outline.  When he says Newark.  Newark.  What?  Newark.  You say Newark?  What's Newark?  It's a place you don't want to walk at after 7 p.m.  Newark.  Wait, say that city again.  Newark.  Newark.  Newark.  Newark.  Yeah, like Newark.  Newark.  Newark.  What's wrong with Newark?  Dork.  I go up there.  Newark.  Oh, people go Newark? 
[01:02:00]  Newark.  No, they're not going Newark.  Newark.  I've never heard Newark or Newark.  People say Newark.  E-W-A-R-K could go Newark.  Newark.  But it's Newark.  Dude, you just fucking gave me the hiccups.  You say Newark.  I thought I saw Cam on your chin.  Oh, people say Newark.  Newark.  Newark.  What?  Newark.  Newark.  I just said it.  No, you're saying Newark.  Newark. 
[01:02:30]  Yes, you said Newark.  It's Newark.  No, it's...  What the fuck?  Newark.  It's Newark.  If you go to somebody, hey, meet me at Penn Station in Newark, they know it's fucking  Newark.  Where you're going is Newark.  If you said Newark, I wouldn't know where the fuck to go.  I'd be like, what are you talking about?  You have to sort of get the W in there.  The W is silent.  It's not silent.  I wish you were.  Newark.  I wish you were a W. 
[01:03:00]  Holy shit.  Newark.  Newark.  Newark.  Oh, Newark.  Yeah, it's like...  Oh, Newark.  Oh, I'm going to say right.  Oh.  Jesus.  Newark.  What?  What was the other one?  Is that your tooth or a piece of gum?  You didn't have to ask that.  Really?  Yes.  I've never...  There's no way you should ever have to say, is that your tooth or a piece of gum?  I saw a boss take his fingers and push something back in his mouth, and I wasn't sure if it 
[01:03:30]  was one of his teeth falling out, a tooth falling out, or a piece of gum.  It's your Nicorette gum.  Nicorette gum he's addicted to now.  Thanks to you guys, this week was three years off of cigarettes.  And you're still chewing the fucking gum.  No, that means you're still a smoker.  Why?  Because you're still in the gum three years later.  Yeah, but you know what?  When I fall asleep with the gum in my mouth, I'm not going to burn the fucking house down.  Okay?  I don't have to relocate.  Or what?  Or you're not going to kill your pal who's sharing a room with you. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Oh, from coughing.  How about you wean yourself off the gum now?  Oh, really?  I'm just saying.  Yeah, really.  It's been three years.  But everyone just has the gum for a little bit, enough to get them through that hurdle,  and then they stop the gum too.  It's not meant to just chew all the time.  Look, a lot of people stop and they go back to cigarettes.  This is better.  This gum, I'm at four milligrams.  They're four milligrams a piece, and I do about 12 a day.  Nork and Mindy.  Okay.  You chew 12 of those a day? 
[01:04:30]  Sorry.  Someone said Nork and Mindy.  Dave Seabra-Flynn.  I couldn't wait.  Nork and Mindy's coming in.  Add to the list, by the way.  Who's going to add Nork to our list?  Yeah.  Now you're nitpicking.  No.  Nork.  I mispronounce all the fucking time, but you make me sound like fucking, I don't know,  an English teacher or something.  Nork.  So.  That's amazing. 
[01:05:00]  What?  Nork?  All right.  Go back to what you were saying.  No, I'm just saying there's four milligrams.  12 of these a day is 48.  Same 48 milligrams.  That's a lot of nicotine.  Is it really, Dave?  Yeah.  What?  No, no.  Do you smoke?  Danny knows a little.  Yeah.  I quit smoking three years ago.  Okay, well, cigarettes, each cigarette has nine milligrams of nicotine, and I used to  smoke.  All right, hold on, Voss.  Shut up.  That's not the point.  You should be off of the gum.  Danny.  Like, if you quit smoking, you should be off of all nicotine.  Danny has stopped smoking about the same time you have.  Now, what did you do when you stopped smoking?  Did you do the gum or anything, Dave? 
[01:05:30]  I got the patch, because here in New York City, you can qualify and get free patches from  the city, so I called, see if I got them for free.  They sent it to my house the next day, and I said, fuck it, I'll get a shot.  How long were you on the patch?  Like, five weeks.  And that's it.  That was it.  And you're still chewing gum three years later.  Three fucking years.  It was hard as fuck.  It's not like it was an easy thing to do, but, uh, right.  Do you drink?  Do you drink alcohol, right?  Oh, very much.  Okay, so you have a fucking vice that you could fall back on any time you want.  Do you smoke pot or get high still? 
[01:06:00]  Probably.  It goes hand-  Well, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  Yeah, I like to eat, too.  That doesn't mean that I'm replacing-  No, no, but eating isn't going to kill you the way drinking-  Yeah, but some people look to it as an escape.  They look to replace their addiction with something.  It doesn't matter what it is.  It could be alcohol.  It could be food.  It could be anything.  So, to replace your smoking addiction with nicotine gum, you're really not replacing anything.  You're just continuing your nicotine addiction.  You're not shooting cocaine.  You're snorting it now.  No, you know what?  But it's the nicotine.  That's exactly what it is.  The nicotine isn't what's killing people. 
[01:06:30]  It's all the chemicals and the tar.  You still have an addiction to nicotine.  Oh, you're right.  And you have an addictive person-  You're just not smoking it.  You're right.  You're 100% right.  But out of the two evils, which is better?  The gum or cigarettes?  How about none evils?  How about just stop chewing the gum?  Oh, really?  How about I just have nothing?  Yes, really?  I have fucking nothing.  Okay?  I don't have alcohol.  I don't have red meat.  I have nothing.  I have golf, and that's it.  And even that, I suck at this week.  Look at the pants I bought. 
[01:07:00]  You got to see these fucking pants.  Yeah, we'll see the pants.  But listen, hold on.  So, but you have other addictions, so you're saying, hey, well, I'm addicted to this.  I'm doing this, but I'm not doing that.  I'm better than you.  But it's not like something was ever, like, was replaced.  Like, I didn't feel the need that I had to fill that void with something else.  Because you're already filling the void.  Those were things that we're doing.  It was things that, yeah, but-  I have nothing to fill the void with.  You do.  So go jogging.  No, I work out.  No, you filling your void to get it.  Smoking, alcohol, drugs, all of it, is to get out of yourself. 
[01:07:30]  It's either to suppress something or get out of yourself.  Okay?  So you don't do cigarettes to get out of yourself or suppress feelings.  You do it with alcohol and drugs.  What is this, 12-stick program shit you're babbling?  Give yourself a crash, please.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah, but why am I-  I'll give myself a crash when worthy.  Okay, why am I being, like, we're not talking about me and my inability to quit nicotine.  We're talking about you and your inability to quit nicotine.  So instead of deflecting things towards me, why don't we get to why you cannot give up the nicotine. 
[01:08:00]  Okay, after we get to that, then we'll get to why you can't quit drinking and drugging.  Okay?  It's the same thing because it fills a fucking void.  That's fun.  It's the same reason you can't drink.  I'll tell you what.  Why is it me, though?  Why is it me?  Because you're still-  Because I didn't go around saying, oh, I quit smoking.  I quit smoking.  I did quit smoking.  I didn't say that.  I quit smoking, but I chew 24 packs of nicotine gum a day. 
[01:08:30]  14 pieces, okay?  14.  You just added 10.  All right?  That's how you alcoholics do.  You exaggerate.  Dude, what are you chewing a piece every hour?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about you cut it down to every other hour?  I'm going to start doing that.  But you're-  That's like, imagine if I was going around going, hey, I'm not drinking in the afternoon  anymore.  Aren't you proud of me?  It's like, well, no, because you're still drinking at night.  You're wrong, because this is not smoking.  Nicotine, yes.  It's not smoking. 
[01:09:00]  So if I get one of those alcohol vapor inhalers, I could say, hey, I'm not drinking anymore.  I'm just inhaling all my booze.  No, because what kills you from cigarettes is the tar and the chemicals.  Why do people-  Why do people-  So when you get mouth cancer-  If you could smoke a cigarette, and you didn't get sick or die from it, from nicotine, people  would still be smoking.  What about chewing tobacco?  There's chemicals.  I don't know.  I don't chew fucking tobacco. 
[01:09:30]  Just because it's not in your lungs doesn't mean that it's a perfectly safe thing.  No, of course it's not safe.  The nicotine gum is not meant to be a replacement for smoking.  Right.  It's meant to, when you have a really bad craving, it takes the edge off.  But that's the thing about the gum.  I didn't want to go on the gum, because this is what happens when you try to quit smoking  on the gum.  You end up just addicted to nicotine gum.  I've seen people go through this before.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not saying I'm not addicted.  Obviously, I am.  Have you tried the patch?  My body's too greasy.  It slides off.  That's disgusting.  Holy shit. 
[01:10:00]  It does not slide off.  The adhesive on the patch is-  It doesn't come off in the shower, Rich.  Rich, I think Jews don't like wearing patches.  Rich, I think at the very least, you could chew gum every other hour.  Well, you don't think I'm aware?  14 pieces is ridiculous.  Listen, there's a guy on the phone.  He says that half the stuff you guys are talking about isn't true.  I've got to get to this phone call.  And people are still stupefied with the whole silent W thing.  They just are amazed who said that.  Tim in Cleveland.  Norc.  Yeah.  Hey, O. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, what are we getting wrong today?  Well, you know, a guy a couple minutes ago-  Okay.  ...who mentioned that, you know, the guy who called up said he drives up from Canton to board up  vacant homes.  Yeah.  He made a comment that they're leveling neighborhoods or tearing down neighborhoods, whatever he said.  Right.  I've lived out here for 13 years.  It's just not true.  I haven't seen it.  It's not happening.  I mean, Cleveland has problems, just like so many other cities right now.  But, you know, it's really not a bad place.  Yeah.  I hear it's awesome when you get outside the city. 
[01:11:00]  Unfortunately, they always put us up in the city, so we have no fucking idea.  There's some big houses.  And I even went down to the flats going, oh, I've heard about the flats, and they closed  that shit down, too, right?  Yeah, they did.  And, you know, in the flats, I mean, they even got a- they had a city councilman or something,  or one of the politicians, he might not have been a councilman, wanted to turn it into  a red-light district, actually.  And that was his plan for economic development.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  I mean, that was probably about a year ago, maybe two.  But, you know, and the flats now, I mean, you know, 10 years ago, you know, if you went 
[01:11:30]  down there, you know, it was booming, now you go in there, it's just, like you said,  it's the land of the zombies.  Right.  You know, it winds up being a great parking lot for Browns games for tailgating.  I guarantee that your homeless could kick the shit out of New York's homeless.  Oh, yeah.  They're like zombies.  I see homeless people every day.  It's just part of living in New York.  But the homeless people in Cleveland were intimidating, aggressive, and just overall way scarier.  Yeah, and they're hungry, you know? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, like Cleveland was a big steel city, big industrial city, and that business  is long gone.  You know, and now, you know, a lot of, you know, like it's been said, a lot of the industry  has moved outside of the city.  You know, there's still a lot there.  You know, like there's a couple of big hospital systems where the, you know, where the big,  you know, employers are, and they're not necessarily right smack downtown.  You know, they're all over the place.  You know what, Tim?  You don't have to sell Cleveland.  I mean, you got LeBron.  Trust me, I'm jealous.  As a Knicks fan, I'm jealous. 
[01:12:30]  You got LeBron.  Can I have a knife and a fork?  A fork.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Bye.  Take care.  Peace.  The flaps.  Ah, Rich.  Uh, Newark.  I, when you're in Newark.  I don't even know how to say it anymore.  Let me try to say it.  Newark?  Newark.  Newark, right?  Yeah.  Newark.  You gotta sort of get.  That's how snooty people say it.  Snooty?  What, do you think you're the fucking Prince of England? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, because snooty people want to make sure they pronounce the name of a shithole city  right.  The way everybody pronounces it.  Newark.  Not Norc.  Norc.  The people I fucking hang out with.  Newark.  Let's go to Newark.  He's getting mad now.  I don't know.  I don't understand him.  The flats.  Here's a.  Talk about my wife's ass, I think.  You're visiting my wife's ass.  Oh, Bonnie.  Why would you say that?  Fucking Margaret Cho ass face. 
[01:13:30]  You don't like her flat ass?  Oh, Jesus.  I feel like when I'm fucking from behind, I feel like I'm fucking a wall.  Did she have an ass and lost it, or what happened?  Never.  She never had an ass?  Obviously, you're not an ass man.  Why did you?  Because I'm an ass man.  Bam, bam.  Because he's a.  I love to kiss him.  Here we go, Rich.  For you.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  What does he do with those asses? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Come on now.  What's he do?  This is what Rich doesn't do to asses.  Ha, ha.  I love to love them.  I love to kick them.  Ha, ha.  I love to shove them.  I love to stick them.  Best wrestling song ever.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  I love to watch them.  Yeah.  I love to pick them.  I bet you do.  And I'm gonna kick them.  And why?  Cause I'm a ass man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  This is Rich's music, only there's a comma after ass. 
[01:14:30]  I'm an ass man.  I'm an ass man.  See, it's a punctuation joke.  I knew you wouldn't get that one, Rich.  See, it's a punctuation joke.  Rich looked at you, Rich looked at you like a deer looks at you when the headlights  are on him.  What would a comma joke?  What would the comma, yeah, exactly.  Ass.  I call it a coma.  Ass comma, man.  You're not a fan of the punctuation joke?  My punctuation jokes are great.  Who sings this?  I don't know.  I don't even know who that is.  It's just a wrestling song to a wrestler. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, but who sang the song?  It had to be someone that was kind of famous when the song came out.  Let's say hi to Bill in Boston.  Ass man.  Hey, what's up, guys?  It's a pleasure to talk to you.  It's a pleasure to have you on the radio show.  Pleasure for us to have your pleasure.  Hey, what's going on with the Red Sox?  Let's talk baseball.  Couldn't care.  Couldn't care.  First place, five in front of the Yankees.  Why aren't you a Red Sox fan?  Work, racing, stuff like that.  Oh, what kind of racing you do?  Four wheelers.  Right on.  I got a Honda 400 EX, brought out to a 440 with a pipe intake, all the good stuff. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, shit.  I don't know what that means.  You got the fucking pipe intake?  What your car does, I can do with my four wheeler.  For real?  I can do that speed.  I think what the, oh, excuse me, Anthony, your Mustang will probably take me, though.  You know, his car can.  Let's just, let's break it way down.  How many miles can you get, do on your four wheel?  About 80.  Jeez.  So your car, your four wheel can do what his car does? 
[01:16:00]  His car can block rain.  That's what his car can do.  I can turn the heat on.  His car, he can drive in the snow and go, it's warm in here.  I don't have respect for a guy that's got a four wheeler that can do that.  In Boston, yeah.  There's a lot of four wheeling up there.  Where do they go?  Hold on.  What?  Have you, we lived in Boston.  You drive a half hour, you're in the middle of nowhere.  Oh, really?  There's plenty of places to go.  Oh, like Westfield?  I don't know where exactly he's going, but yeah, there's plenty of places that go four 
[01:16:30]  wheeling.  All right, Bill.  Let me tell you about a quick one, right?  There's a mall out there.  My kid brother goes to school out there now.  There's a mall out there they built on an old dump, and the methane's been coming up to  the ground and killing people.  They had to close it all down.  It's brand new.  They had to close an entire mall because they built it on it.  Well, they moved the Walmart out, and now there's some shitty dollar store because Walmart  wouldn't stay there, but they were able to pick it up pretty cheap, so there's some shitty  dollar store there now.  You know what the dollar store is now? 
[01:17:00]  What's their slogan now?  It's not just for blacks.  Everything for almost a dollar or something like that.  Hey, let me say one more thing to Anthony about Cleveland.  Yeah.  You've got to be aware there's a lot of colors out there.  Oh, Anthony.  Jesus.  Come on.  Anthony.  Anthony.  That's not right.  That's a derogatory term that we don't use here.  There you go.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay.  Hey, LB. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Rich.  First of all, four milligrams is the largest dose of nicotine gum they have.  Wait, wait.  I can't hear you.  He's breaking up.  It did break up, so you're saying that ... Try it again there, Jay.  All right.  Four milligrams is the largest dose of nicotine gum they have.  Yeah, I know they don't.  Only.  Number two, you're only supposed to have one piece of gum, one every two hours for the  first six weeks.  Yeah.  You're about three years past what the F you're supposed to do with it. 
[01:18:00]  I know that.  I know that.  And I know that four milligrams is the most, because I was looking for six and eight, and  they don't have them.  Rich, you are the most successful functional illiterate I've ever heard of, so I congratulate  you on that.  Thank you.  Do you dress sexy when you buy it, so you can get more for less money?  Do you blow the fucking pharmacist?  You put on those old Daisy Dukes, do you?  I went into a fire.  To get a higher dose?  I went into one of the places.  I don't know if I want to say their name.  I swear to God, I go, I have nicotine gum, and they said, can I have ID?  And I had a fight with a lady. 
[01:18:30]  I called her.  Why ID?  I can need ID.  Identification, because you have to be over 21.  I go, obviously, I'm not bullshit.  I can tell you the name of the company.  Rich, you look good for 60, but let's relax.  I'm telling you, they wouldn't say I had a big fight with them.  You're trying to say someone thought you might be under 21?  No, they were just following rules.  You know how rules people are?  That's why they work as clerks in places like that, because they can't make an executive decision.  Sometimes they got to do it to everybody, so they don't look like they're profiling  or picking on any one person. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  That's ridiculous.  They're saying you should do laser therapy or something.  I imagine all this gum chewing, it can't be good for you.  My stomach is a fucking mess.  It hurts sometimes.  It can't be good for you.  I'm going to get rid of it.  This guy's telling you that you're supposed to do it every other hour for only six weeks.  You're three years in.  You know, the smoke and the tar, sure, that'll give you lung cancer and shit like that,  or whatever, throat cancer, mouth cancer, all that fun stuff.  But the nicotine has to be doing something to you.  It has to be.  It's like an amphetamine.  Okay, here's what I'm going to...  Oh, you guys act like I don't fucking... 
[01:19:30]  Really?  When you did coke, that wasn't good.  I fucking know that it's not good because I do it nonstop.  I can't sleep.  Like, I'll schedule my sleeping around it.  Yes, I know I'm addicted to it.  I know.  But on the side of the box, it doesn't say, can be addictive, so I might have a lawsuit  down the road, too, okay, so maybe there's a little fucking plan in little Jewy Jew's  head, okay?  It doesn't say, can be addictive, all right?  Yeah, but you're waiting for what? 
[01:20:00]  Part of your jaw to fall out, and then you're going to bring on the lawsuit?  I'm going to bring in half a face and go, this is where I'm headed, okay?  People are eating you up today, man.  Jay, thank you.  Anything else?  No, that's it, boys.  Have a good one.  We're learning about Nicorette gum there.  I know.  Okay, here's my game plan.  What?  As of, when this box goes down, I'm going to wean myself off it.  It'll take...  Bubani?  Dude.  No, I think that box goes down.  That box... 
[01:20:30]  Dude, don't confuse us for giving a shit.  No, I...  After...  You know what I'm going to do?  He goes, after today, whatever.  What I'm going to do is...  Chew away.  We're just exploiting you for fucking ratings.  I know, you fucking...  Keep it up, stupid.  What I'm going to do is, I'm not going to do Nicorette gum.  And I'm going to sit and look at sunsets.  And I'm going to get addicted to that.  Yeah.  And maybe watch grass grow.  Do some of that.  And go take pictures of leaves.  And fucking gobble up cock on the rest of the fucking day. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, look at the...  Look at the leaves turn colors.  What?  You're not a fan of the sunset picture?  Oh, it's so...  Who gives a fuck?  The sunset.  You've seen one, you've seen them all.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  The sunset.  Have you not seen my sunset book yet?  Yes.  The sunset.  Let's go and watch the leaves turn colors up north.  What the fuck?  I hope he's going to make a coffee table book with all of his sunsets.  Watch.  It's like the biggest selling book ever.  Yeah, it'll be huge.  I'll show you.  Yeah.  And then I'm going to follow it up with a foliage book. 
[01:21:30]  That's what I just said.  I know.  I've done that.  I've checked out the leaves.  Yeah, you're right.  The fans are looking at you two in different ways now.  I know.  One looks like a Nazi.  One acts like a Nazi.  One is gay.  One fucks 14-year-olds.  Look, I brought that to the show over 10 years ago.  I did some leaf peeping.  Not fucking.  It's just cuddling.  Right. 
[01:22:00]  And it's not gay if you don't push back.  So shut the fuck up, Rich.  Leaf peeping.  You've never done a little leaf peeping?  Leaf peeping?  Yeah, up there in New Hampshire.  The only time I look at leaves is when I'm looking for my ball under the leaves in the woods or something.  I once saw a moose.  Yeah?  Whoa.  That ought to bring back some good.  So two of them at Voss's show at the stress factory. 
[01:22:30]  You know, just for you now.  I saw a moose.  Now I take a picture of a sunset every night, fucker.  That's what I do now.  Look at the flakes.  No two flakes are alike.  No, I'm not into the snowflake thing.  No?  Leaf peeping.  I do like flowers.  Oh, and I like roads.  Really?  Paths.  You like roads?  Paths?  I'm a fan of the path.  You're a fan of the lane?  Did God...  No, just like...  And when you walked along...  There you go. 
[01:23:00]  See, I'm a fan of that.  And he just found a great road.  Well, I'm not alone with this one.  And during the tough time in life, when you were walking along that path, did God carry  you?  Yes, the footprints.  Footprints.  I'm not a fan of the footprint poem, you asshole.  I am a fan of the path.  You're going to come out with a poem in a sunset.  Or the road.  Sunsets.  Or the road.  Sunsets.  Not that one, Dan.  Not so much.  I said, God, why during the hardest times of my life, would there no sunsets for me to  photograph?  God, during the times of my life when I was out of work. 
[01:23:30]  Look, see?  Why did you leave me in Newark?  You can Google image your ass off with paths.  Yeah, look at that.  Look at that one.  Well, that's beautiful.  Yeah, isn't it?  That's beautiful.  If you're looking farther down, you can see bodies.  I was just going to say, that is a, you're getting raped path.  That's a path.  Every one of these paths look like, it looks like evidence photos.  There's a perp at the back of that path.  The path to violation. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  Okay.  All right, give me another path picture.  It calms me down.  It calms you down.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, look at that.  There's an Aryan brotherhood meeting in the back.  Like, if you look farther back.  But the wonder, the wonderment of these pictures, you don't know where it leads to.  I am the fan.  And then your creative mind gets going and you wonder, wonder what's down the road.  A bulldozer clearing the way for a track home. 
[01:24:30]  Toll brothers buying up property.  I'm a fan of alleys.  Stephen S. for Bayshore writes, does the long and winding road make you cry?  Fuck you, Stephen.  Jesus Christ.  You know that paint job my brother just got you?  Well, forget it, fucker.  Wow.  I am reading the road.  That's nice.  Who wants to paint F.H.  Riley's because Stephen S. from Bayshore isn't?  Motherfucker.  Oh, no.  What did he do?  He just insulted me, so now I take the job away from him. 
[01:25:00]  Well, yeah.  And the free fucking beer.  Is that something you would do?  Would they tell you that in The Road Less Traveled when you read that?  Isn't this be nice to others?  You know, the poor guy's butt broke.  Yeah?  Well, then maybe he shouldn't be so smart.  He's baroque.  Ah, baroque.  Oh, look at those beautiful trails.  Look at that.  Stephen S. might have painted the place already.  Did you, Stephen?  Really?  I'm going out there today.  I'll take a look at your work.  Sometimes when I can't see a trail, I'll just eat a bag of trail mixing.  Have you ever mountain biked or any of that shit? 
[01:25:30]  It's cool out there.  Do I mountain bike?  Have you ever hiked?  It's cool out there.  Yeah, I used to hike when I was a kid.  You ever get into nature a little bit, Rich?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah, I play golf.  That's my nature.  I go all over here.  That's not nature.  That's fake nature.  How's it fucking fake nature when it's built into like a quarry or the fucking...  A quarry.  Or in the fucking woods?  Where are you from?  Where the fuck are you from?  15 minutes from Newark.  Newark.  Weston Newark.  Plainfield.  That's a nice... 
[01:26:00]  Golf courses are not nature, really.  Oh, yeah.  It's man-made.  Nah, totally.  It's man-made.  Gotta be fucking sprinklers.  Oh, really?  It's man-made golf, but it's not like you're in nature.  Yeah, in some courses.  Maybe if your ball goes in the woods.  Yeah, but there's beautiful...  You see the leaves turn colors.  You see the beautiful green grass grow.  Sometimes the sun sets while you're playing at the end of the day.  See, I like that.  You're putting on the 18th hole and the sun's setting.  16th, 17th hole.  The sun's starting to set.  The sun's setting.  Nice, right? 
[01:26:30]  You get ready to putt and a tear comes down your eye.  All right.  Go on.  And you'd rather be playing wiffle ball.  Okay?  Oh, let's go build a sandcastle.  I've never built a sandcastle, you fuck.  Let's live in this sandcastle, because life has to be better.  Let's keep it on the road.  I've never built a sandcastle.  We used to build, like, tunnels and stuff for our army men.  You built tunnels?  Yeah.  For our men.  They were called men.  Army men.  And then we would dig really, really, really, like, deep holes in my grandma's house. 
[01:27:00]  But no fucking sandcastles.  Of course.  Yeah.  Oh, there's nature.  Oh, you know what?  Dan has shown us a picture of nature.  That looks like nature, you ass.  Of course.  Right in between houses and the Clearview Expressway.  That's a course that they fucking built.  When they build courses into.  What do you think?  Golf courses grow naturally sometimes?  No, you fucking idiot.  They can put a course.  They can build.  They can take a plot of land and build a course.  No shit.  That's not nature.  But also, they build courses in areas that are wooded areas, that are nature areas, that 
[01:27:30]  they'll build a course into that.  But they have to plow shit down.  And they do it more than they do to build houses.  In Rich's world, I bet you if you get the right amount of water, the special water,  you can build a golf course.  A green just grows the way it does in a fairway, and sand traps form.  No, you fucking idiots.  Of course.  It's nature.  It's nature.  Oh, yeah.  That's enough.  Okay.  First of all, don't slobber them.  Why did a tee box grow here?  Oh, you know what? 
[01:28:00]  You guys will exaggerate.  Of course you're going to find a course.  Of course you're going to find a course.  Of course.  Of course.  And no one has teeth like me except a horse.  Of course.  Of course.  You know, I'm getting killed on Instant Feet Back.  Voss is getting killed.  So I think you and I have to team up to kill him.  Because we're losing bet.  Vince from Bayonne writes, next on Oprah, the homespun wisdom of Greg Faggy Hughes.  Author of The Path to Sunsets and Other Homo Destinations.  It's homespun. 
[01:28:30]  That's what your pictures are.  Homespun.  Fucking Ansel Adams.  See if you'd play Beth Page with us Monday.  You can walk down a nice path.  I don't want to bore everyone.  Beth Paggy.  I don't want to bore everyone to death.  But me and Voss play golf from time to time.  And I have an offer to play Beth Page Black with Rich Voss Monday.  They just had the U.S. Open there.  The course is a complete fucking nightmare. 
[01:29:00]  It's a mess.  And I don't want to play.  Because I'm not that good.  Because people think I'm not good at golf.  I just love playing.  You got to chewed up what that course is right now?  I used to be okay.  That course is a nightmare.  It's a nightmare.  It really is.  There's no fun in it.  There's no fun in it.  But also when it's in good shape, it's a nightmare.  Now it's fucking chewed up.  Oh, no.  It's already back.  It's pouring rain.  What did they do?  Nature grew back.  They threw down some fucking special water.  What happens is grass regrowth. 
[01:29:30]  Nature reheals.  Really?  It reheals.  Really?  After a week.  It's like a scab.  After a week, there's no big, huge fucking divots and people walking all over shit marks.  Yeah, but those are...  Our balls aren't going to be anywhere near the divots.  Okay?  All right.  I'll give you that.  The woods are nice and clear.  Pat from Munaki, he writes, Opie, your sunsets and paths are getting dangerously similar  to the bridges of Madison County.  Yes.  I'm taking some pictures of the bridges. 
[01:30:00]  The sunsets of New York City.  Could I put my Blackberry in your refrigerator to preserve the film?  You got to know the movie to know how brilliant that line is right there.  Yeah.  I had to see it.  Go fuck yourself.  Go to loudmouthpants.com.  What?  Just go to loudmouthpants.  Are we looking at your pants now?  Yeah.  Go to loudmouthpants.com.  If you want something to talk about.  Saw a boss perform over the weekend.  Oh, wait.  Are they on the end?  Oh. 
[01:30:30]  I know he wants a compliment, so that's what I'm going to say.  No, of course.  Well, you're not going to say...  You see how excited you got to put his headphones on?  Where do you want us to go?  Oh, is it loudmouthmouth.com.  Sorry.  I screwed up.  That's always good to get a virus when you put in the wrong fucking site.  Okay.  Go to pants.  Wait.  You just bought these pants for the golf course?  Go to the bottom.  To the bottom left.  This looks like when you play Tiger Woods golf and you got to pick out the wacky pants.  Well, the wacky pants gets all you.  Anjo's nice.  Dude, you didn't get those pants.  Yes, I did. 
[01:31:00]  For golf?  Yeah.  You know what?  What?  I would so wear those on a golf course.  Would you?  Oh, yeah.  You know what I'm scared of?  My car breaks down on the way to the course and I get raped.  You're wearing those.  You would get fucking...  What?  You'd have a cock in your mouth in a second.  Well, let's not make this...  We're trying to make this radio show way more visual.  So, how do they see these pants there, Danny?  For themselves.  Just go down to any gay fucking gay road.  To parade this weekend.  No, there's something so obnoxious about that. 
[01:31:30]  I would wear it.  Are they fucking cool?  I would wear them.  Only on the golf course, though.  Only on the golf course, though.  Loud mouth.  Yeah, just click on pants and scroll down and it's the pair of pants that looks like a pack  of Fruit Stripes gum.  That's a good way to look at it.  It really does.  Danny seems disgusted about that.  You wouldn't wear those?  No.  Well, Danny doesn't play golf.  Well, when he's drinking or something, you can do that.  I wouldn't wear those to sleep.  There's nothing about playing golf with those pants.  Are you serious?  No.  They're fucking cool, man.  Is that a distraction for other people that you're playing with?  Maybe they look and they can't play. 
[01:32:00]  No.  I don't know.  It matches a lot of clothes.  They don't want to bend over to tee up a ball in front of you?  Is that what it is?  That distracts them.  That's how they tee up.  Yeah, they tee up the ball by squatting down.  Fucking keeping an eye on your...  Jimmy S. from Delaware is willing to give you $1,000 for my spot at Bethpage Black.  Wow.  Yeah, that's why we should play Monday because everybody wants to play Bethpage Black.  Yeah, they really do.  Everybody.  You can't get a tee time there right now. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, I know.  How'd you get it?  Paulie got it.  Paulie and Kenny.  Do I know these people?  Paulie.  Yeah, from...  Kenny's the weekend manager at Caroline's.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  The nicest guy in the world.  Paulie's his son.  Oh, no kidding.  So they got the tee time.  The only problem is...  It's late.  At the time we're going to tee off, which I don't want to tell...  The only problem is, driving out from North, the time we got to play...  The time we're playing, this guy is going to be... 
[01:33:00]  We probably only might get 15 holes in, so I'm kind of...  Like, I don't...  Oh, late tee time.  Why are you grabbing your crotch?  Because I'm thinking of Bethpage.  I'm shifting it.  That's where he keeps his gum.  And so no one asks for a piece.  Onion Nicorette.  Somebody would give $1,000 for a tee time there?  That's crazy.  He could fly out to Pebble Beach and play that.  No, he's not lying, and I know he's not lying, because everybody wants to play Bethpage Black.  I'm the kind of person, if it was my tee time, I would give it to him for free. 
[01:33:30]  I just played it.  What?  I just played Bethpage Black yesterday.  On video?  Yeah.  Tiger Woods 10.  I know.  Oh, I got Tiger Woods 2, but yeah.  Or 1?  1 or 2?  There's 10?  Why are you always behind everything?  Why is it like fucking...  Because I got it at a garage sale or something.  I don't fucking know.  Stop getting hand-me-downs.  On my Sega system.  Yeah, too.  Of course it's a course of...  You know, what the fuck's the difference?  It is bad.  Look at those pants.  You really have Tiger Woods 2? 
[01:34:00]  I have got to see what the graphics look like on Tiger Woods 2.  He's white.  That's funny, Rich.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  I just played it yesterday on 10.  That course...  But even to play 15 holes, you know...  Dude, I would love to.  I just know I would be miserable.  Do you think we can get a round in at four and a half hours there?  It's almost impossible there, right?  Well, the guys that...  Hunting for your balls half the fucking time.  That fucking course is a night...  I just played Pinehurst and had a great round there. 
[01:34:30]  Just watch them call it up to your waist.  Take a drop.  I don't want to say grass.  What do they call it?  Do they call it a...  Vescue.  Vescue or something.  Right.  What?  It's a nightmare.  Blascue.  And then you try to...  Then you hit out...  Did you sneeze?  No.  Then you try to hit out of that and your club gets strangled.  You get strangled.  It's a nightmare.  Club twist.  You break your...  It's...  I don't want to play.  I can't believe I'm saying this because it's a great opportunity.  It'll humble you, that course.  You know what?  You were first pick.  Ben Bailey was second behind you.  Oh, wow. 
[01:35:00]  He said no.  You know what?  The course is so intimidating.  Hold on.  I got to think about this.  How could you not run it?  Was I the first person you asked to play golf at Bethpage Black?  Yes.  You could call Kenny.  I called Paulie.  Hmm.  I might have been.  You were definitely the first person.  I could show you my phone log.  Dude, you were fifth on my list to go see the last day of the US Open this past Monday.  And you were first on my list to say no to that because you called me like at fucking...  You know, the night...  You were number five.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Look at you guys just trying to outdo each other on how far down the list you are to do things together. 
[01:35:30]  I'll tell you what happened.  Two out of my three brothers said no, right?  And I'm driving from Philly and knowing I have the US Open tickets for the last day.  Then I called Bill Burr and it went to voicemail.  Then I called Rich Voss.  You called Bill?  What the fuck would you call Bill Burr for?  Wait, wait, wait.  We'll get to that in a second.  Okay.  We'll get to that in a second.  Keep that right there.  Keep that there.  Hold on.  So then on the way back from Philly, I called Rich and I officially invite him to go to the US Open Monday with me, right? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  And then he goes, well, I got to call you back because I got to figure it out with Bonnie and stuff.  And I go, all right.  And I'm still driving.  So I'm like, whatever.  And then my brother calls and says he could go.  And then I had to call Rich back.  But here's the thing.  And don't take this personal.  Don't take this personal.  Right from the beginning, I knew I wasn't going because I played golf Monday morning.  Right?  And I just, what the fuck are you laughing at now?  You.  Never mind.  Go ahead.  What golf game is this?  That's hysterical.  That's got to be Atari golf. 
[01:36:30]  Okay.  Atari.  But wait, why would you call Billy Burr to go to a golf thing?  I mean, Billy's a great guy.  He's a funny guy.  Because I like him better.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's really fucking heartbreaking.  They are kind of brothers in the red hair.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  Temper thing.  Both of them don't tan.  That's the problem.  They burn together.  We can go to the...  And we both have tempers that we don't know how to control.  They're both...  They're very similar as far as their personalities go.  Voss, you know I like you. 
[01:37:00]  I don't mind.  That's okay.  But Jesus, you didn't call Patrice before me to go.  Oh, Jesus.  They would have made him carry a bag.  I was doing it for the radio.  I called Bill Burr first.  What do you mean for the radio?  No.  Voss, of course I called you before Bill Burr.  Because I don't feel like getting the phone call later.  Well, was that just for the radio?  Or are you...  Did you really call Bill?  Or did you really call Bill?  Because that's crazy.  Because he doesn't even like calls.  No, he's starting to like it. 
[01:37:30]  You know, and I invited you to Doral.  And I didn't have to do that.  And we had a good time.  I'm going to our vacation.  I thought we were friends.  I'm taking my kids on vacation to Doral.  That's a good place.  All right.  So where's Tiger Woods 2, Danny?  Is this really Tiger Woods 2?  Come on.  There's no fucking way.  Well, this is from N64.  It's called Cyber Tiger.  Right.  And if Voss keeps wanting to reference it as Tiger Woods 2, then this is, I guess, the game that he's sugerical.  Is that the game you're playing, Voss?  Oh, the graphics are awful. 
[01:38:00]  No, the Tiger Woods I'm playing is a real Tiger Woods.  Do you mean 2002?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  2002.  It ends with two.  You know, I try to abbreviate.  It's a seven-year-old video game.  Oh, look at this one I got, though.  Nothing changes in seven years over video games.  Hey.  Uh-huh.  Is this what you're talking about?  The camera?  The uploads?  It does videos and pictures like yours.  You're finally getting a nice camera.  But see, yours, you just put right into the computer.  This has a fucking cable. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  And it's only just 10-minute video.  No, Voss.  What the fuck are you getting?  Voss.  We're all doing flips.  Get a fucking flip and be done with it.  It's got a card in it.  It's got a blue card.  I don't know.  So you can pop the card out and plug it into your computer.  I was just checking on my, you know, you don't need a wire.  No, a cord to download it to your computer.  That's what I mean.  You pop the card out.  Yeah, but I don't have one of those things in my computer to put a card in.  It doesn't have a fucking SD slot on their goddamn computer these days.  That's the one I want to get now.  Just get the HD.  I was fooling around with my Ultra HD flip yesterday. 
[01:39:00]  Holy shit.  Good.  Nice.  Nice.  Let's see if this works.  You take that video, I'm going to fucking smash your camera.  No, I just took a picture.  This is Tiger Woods 2?  2002.  Dude, you have no idea what you're missing.  The graphics are.  There's no real shadowing.  The reflection looks silly.  The water doesn't even move.  Yeah, that's when I liked him better when he was light-skinned.  That's light-skinned.  Light-skinned.  That's what they say.  Who says? 
[01:39:30]  Black people say.  The rest of the Voss family.  When they go light-skinned, they go light-skinned.  You can have a black caller call in.  So I want to say that you and I, Voss, are having a very dysfunctional bromance.  Bromance.  You guys do.  Having a squabble in your bromance.  And Blue Healer from Kentucky writes,  Do you like Tiger Woods 10 more than Hot Shots Golf?  I still say Hot Shots Golf is the best golf video game.  Hot Shots Golf?  Which one's that?  Is that the one with a click?  It goes...  It's cartoony, but it's...  I don't know... 
[01:40:00]  I hate cartoony games.  Well, but the gameplay seems a little better.  And I don't even know if they're making another Hot Shots.  I'm about a year behind in the Hot Shots games.  Hey, you know what I have in here?  What do you got, Rich?  I have...  And I didn't even realize, you know,  the pilot that Bonnie and I did for Comedy Central.  It's fucking funny, man.  Is it?  It's funny.  You can see a couple...  Yeah.  Anyone pick it up?  No.  This wasn't...  It's fucking funny.  If it's funny, then why don't you keep reworking it?  We tried. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, we redid it again,  but I didn't mean to throw you guys off your game.  No, we're ready to break anyway.  Ready to what?  Take a break?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Why not?  Yeah, that's the one I played.  That was last year, Danny?  I'm not sure which one I was.  I don't know.  Hot Shots 5?  It's an anime chick fucking playing golf.  What is that?  Yeah.  I like Hot Shots.  What the hell do you have?  It's fucking cornbread, but it's spicy.  Have you ever had spicy cornbread?  It was a bag of Oreos.  What, boss?  Bag of Oreos?  You don't see Colin Powell in here. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, God.  Jesus.  I know.  Boss, you're killing today, by the way.  It has to be said.  Oh.  We got a professional golfer.  Hello.  What happened here?  It's on his phone.  Hello?  Hello?  Hey.  Yes?  Wait, it was on his phone.  Well, yeah, actually, it's cut out.  Sorry.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, I'm actually driving down from New York to Florida, and I am a professional  golfer.  I just gave it up, though.  But if you want to play Bethpage Black, I heard boss saying, oh, yeah, it's four and a half 
[01:41:30]  hours.  Well, try not to be a hacker out there.  You know what I mean?  It's pretty tough.  But at the same time, you know, it's like it says right there, you know, play and, you  know, have some game.  Yeah, well, here's the thing.  You're a professional golfer, right?  So you're a scratch golfer, right?  Probably one or two handicapped, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So you're saying, no, I'm a 14 handicap, okay?  Which is respectable. 
[01:42:00]  No, I am.  I just, I can show you my handicap card.  I'm a 14 handicap.  So the thing is, I can respectably play golf.  You should see some of the balls he finds saying it's his ball.  That's mine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They say Dunlap, 1984.  Oh, do they?  Is that where I was going?  I was going to go with an orange golf ball joke.  Oh, really?  You start the hole with a white ball, and you're putting with an orange one at the end saying,  a range ball.  I got a four.  Okay.  First of all, I know I'm cheating golf.  But as a golf pro, and I'm not going to smash you because I respect you because it's probably 
[01:42:30]  the toughest thing, but I can shoot low 80s, high 70s.  You can't do an hour on stage.  Shut your face and don't ever call me a hack.  Oh, it's not about that.  He's not calling you a hack.  Yes, he was.  He said, if you don't be a hack and hit the ball.  If you don't be a hack, yes.  Of course you don't want to.  He's giving a general statement of Beth Page Black.  Oh, I thought he was trashing me.  I'm sorry.  No, he means hack like on the course, right?  He's a level.  He's a different level.  Thank you.  Yes.  He could be a good golfer and still hack it up at Beth Page Black because it's a ridiculous 
[01:43:00]  course.  Voss can be proud that his score is also his IQ.  What's your name, sir?  See, that's a smart joke, Voss.  Where are you going in Florida?  Where are you headed?  I'm on a Ford Lauderdale.  I actually, because I couldn't make any money playing and teaching golf for as much as I  can now.  Uh-huh.  That's something a little different.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to attack you.  I played the toughest course, the toughest course on the planet in Florida called Old  Corkscrew.  It was a fucking nightmare.  It sounds like a roller coaster. 
[01:43:30]  It was horrible.  I played Old Corkscrew.  Hey, can you tell me?  What's that?  I've been driving since 1.30 in the morning.  I don't know.  I was smoking a little doobie on the way and, uh, you know, two-tuning it, too.  So I've been just driving all the freaking morning, been stuck an hour and a half of  traffic.  It's been crazy, this whole freaking ride.  It's not crazy.  Well, I hope, uh, I hope we're keeping you entertained there, buddy.  How much pussy does a golf pro get from the, if you, if you like, if you were a golf pro  at, like, some Ritchie Country Club, would you be banging any of these broads there? 
[01:44:00]  Well, I actually had a daughter, actually, uh, this chick that, uh, she was the daughter  of one of the members, and she wound up.  I wound up poking up with her, but she had, like, those orangutan titties that, like,  deflated.  Uh-huh.  Oh, fuck.  Was she a mom?  That's when I completely agree with getting the breast implants.  Did she have a kid?  No, no, she was just fat.  Like, she was, like, a milk or anything.  She was, had to have, and then got skinny, and then, like, you know, her tips didn't bounce  back from that whole...  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  ...of vomiting in the toilet and, you know, yelling at herself or whatever the fuck.  Nice.  ...deal it.  All right, guys.  All right, Chris, thank you.  Thanks for the phone call.  We're going to take a break.  Uh, Rich Voss, uh, doing well today for us.  Yes, absolutely.  TreehouseComedy.com.  He's going to be there Saturday for a benefit, right?  No, no, no, no.  Thursday, I'm doing some benefit for Treehouse.  Well, Thursday's today.  Yeah, tonight I'm doing a benefit in somewhere for, uh...  Okay.  ...another...  ...but this is, uh...  ...Saturday, July 11th. 
[01:45:00]  ...at the Treehouse in Spack.  So, it's down the road a little bit.  So, TreehouseComedy.com.  I highly recommend you see Rich Voss, uh, Rich Voss.  And August 1st at Mardi Gras Bar and Grill in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Right.  Go to RichVoss.com for his comedy dates.  Yeah.  Uh...  All right, you can leave now.  You did good.  Oh.  For real?  Yeah.  No, what the fuck?  I'm not...  You can't kick me out.  No, we want you out.  I'm not fucking going anyway.  They're telling us you have to go.  Yeah, they're saying you have to go.  Who's saying I have to go?  Exactly.  You've had a great two hours, and it could only mean that it's going to be down. 
[01:45:30]  I'm fucking building.  You know what I just realized?  So, let's just...  Let's just...  Here's what I realized.  I do really well when I stand.  Because I feel more comfortable.  Really?  I was in Walmart yesterday.  You ever run into a girl that you...  I fucked this girl years ago.  That was...  It was...  She was big.  A bigums.  Like, I would sneak them down.  I told you this, sir.  I think in the basement, I had a mattress down there.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Class act.  And this girl was...  And I saw her, and we're talking. 
[01:46:00]  Like, she's standing there looking at me.  I'm talking to her.  You know, I barely recognize her.  I didn't recognize her.  And the whole time we're talking, we're both in our minds thinking, he fucked me.  And I fucked her.  Oh, shit.  You know what I mean?  It was...  This was 20-something.  Awkward moment.  It was so uncomfortable.  I'm going, she knows that I was mean to her, and I fucked her.  You know what I mean?  It was, like, gross.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, because she walks into my basement down there.  She must have really been a beauty when you just recently saw her.  Really?  Mess. 
[01:46:30]  At Walmart.  I thought she was a worker.  And then I'm like, and not only was I mean, and I'm sorry to any girl I was ever mean to,  and I'm sorry to any girl that I came quick and made an excuse.  Every girl.  Made an excuse.  And, you know, and I'm sorry that I would hand you my CD as a parting gift.  I'm sorry about all of that.  I'm trying to make amends.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We'll get back.  The gay exorcism that went down at a church.  Yeah, this is great.  It's an amazing story. 
[01:47:00]  Also...  I swear.  I'm not possessed.  Also, there's a Philly man in a lot of trouble for blasting porn.  Is he a superhero?  Philly man?  Philly man.  For blasting porn?  It's a great little story out of Philly.  All righty.  And some other good things coming in.  Goodness.  There was something else I wanted to...  Some goodness gracious.  Ah, whatever.  We'll figure it out after the break.  Yeah, fuck it.  Opie and Anthony.  They ruined this fucking song. 
[01:47:30]  It's the cruise ship song now.  Yeah, exactly.  Lust for life.  Opie and Anthony.  Royal Caribbean.  Thank you, Mars.  My phones are back.  Bomp, bump, ba-bomp, ba-bomp.  It hasn't updated in 10 minutes, though.  The instant feedback.  New problem.  That usually means a lot of people are trying instant feedback.  Yes.  The numbers are climbing for the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you want to do?  Bimp, bimp. 
[01:48:00]  What was that thing you had there before we went to break?  Well, the Philly thing's really quick.  And then we'll do the homo...  That's the one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the gold.  That's the story of the day.  Cops say Philadelphia man blared porn to keep children away.  Oof.  I used that to get them in.  Police in suburban Philadelphia say a man weary of children playing in his cul-de-sac  blared a pornographic soundtrack to chase them off. 
[01:48:30]  How old are they?  Uh, 32.  So all these kids thought, all they thought they would listen to was a guy with asthma  or something.  What's a porn soundtrack?  Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh.  Blot-a-dee-dee-dee-dum-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Be more funny.  No, first of all, do you understand?  He said a porn soundtrack would just be breathing and...  No, it's...  What porn are you listening to?  I don't listen to the words. 
[01:49:00]  I just look at it.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Point taken.  You never heard like, you know.  Oh, fuck me, fuck me, all that kind of stuff.  Yeah, all that stuff.  Oh, you're right.  But again.  Why do you buy a house in a cul-de-sac if you don't want to deal with kids?  Yeah.  That's where they hang out.  That's where you hang out.  That's where kids ride their bikes.  Michael Buck faces a felony.  My children play with their toys.  Michael Buck.  Oh.  Two, I think.  Yes.  Michael Buck faces a felony obscenity charge and two misdemeanors. 
[01:49:30]  For cranking up the porn audio.  Irate neighbors told police they could hear the sexually explicit audio block and a half away.  Wow.  Wait a second.  What kind of speakers are you?  What's the law against that?  I thought up until 10 o'clock you're allowed to blast.  You can't really.  Yeah, I wonder what the law is.  You know, that's like saying rap music is offensive to certain people.  What the fuck?  There's an amendment there.  The dude's only 27.  I thought it was an old guy.  27-year-old guy.  Yeah, he sounds like a smart-ass kind of a dummy. 
[01:50:00]  Uh, he doesn't have a listed number and his lawyer declined to comment Wednesday.  No one has a listed number.  We all have cell phones.  What is this listed number?  What I don't understand is...  Why aren't cell phone numbers in the phone book?  Wow, you just freaked me out.  There's too many of them.  Too many cell phones now.  The phone books would have to be too big.  I'm glad they're not, but...  You figure one phone per household back in the old days.  Now it's one phone at least per person.  Yeah.  Sometimes two.  Imagine how big that phone book would be.  Let's do phone book jokes. 
[01:50:30]  What's crazy is that there's even a cul-de-sac in Philly.  That's a city.  That's not a cul-de...  No, that's not a joke.  Okay, target.  What's next?  Okay, listen.  We can't...  I hope you knew you were going to fall apart on the back nine.  I know.  I told you.  I'm not falling apart.  You did great on the front.  I said you could go home.  You did great on the front nine.  You could have been in the clubhouse drinking beers.  You decided you needed to go another nine.  He just looked over his shoulder at the clock, too.  Rich just went, oh, fuck, what time is it? 
[01:51:00]  How long do I have for a comeback?  36 on the front nine, 50 on the back.  For Rich Ross, scoring 86.  The back nine, just hold on.  That was one hole.  I bogeyed one hole.  You already got a snowman.  It's not a snowman.  A golf humor for everybody.  Snowman.  Jesus Christ.  There's no mulligans on the OVN.  Listen, first of all, it wasn't a mulligan.  What was...  It wasn't a joke about the sound.  I saw her yesterday.  Yeah.  Cameron Diaz.  I saw her live.  I was 10 feet away from her. 
[01:51:30]  How does she look?  She looks fucking ridiculous.  You mean hot or...  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  I heard she had a bad compulsion.  That's what I heard.  Did I see bad...  All right, all right.  Let me look.  She doesn't look that great on TV, though.  The lighting is real bad right there.  I'll give her that.  I think she's got too much rouge on it.  Honestly, they did some kind of premiere for her new movie.  I don't know.  Some horrible fucking chick flick.  What is she doing?  She shaved her head off.  In real life.  Or her hair.  She shaved her head off. 
[01:52:00]  That would rock.  What if Rich is rubbing off Bobby?  I'm going to go right down on my...  You're right on the list.  Because that's what Mike could have said.  But on TV, she doesn't look as...  In person, I'm telling you, she was ridiculous.  Yeah.  She didn't shave her hair, really, though.  That was for TV, for a movie.  No, I'm sure she probably did.  No, because look how it didn't grow back that fast.  That's not a wig.  You can see the roots and everything.  I have no idea.  She's kind of hot, though.  And this chick that just uses too much fucking conditioner. 
[01:52:30]  It's a local joke, unfortunately.  This is one of these...  We have a news girl that does the entertainment report.  She's beautiful.  A beautiful Irish girl.  I could have went out with her, actually, on a date.  But it's a story for another day.  But anyway.  Oh, my God.  She wears...  Now that's hot.  She has too much conditioner in her fucking hair.  It's the flottest hair ever.  See, this is a cancer movie.  This is some kind of like...  Oh, look how...  Someone's got the cancer.  Jesus, it's so depressing.  And then they shave their head to be in camaraderie with the...  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  That looks like a real tearjerker, doesn't it?  Oh, it looks like a lot of fun.  Get a tear and then get a jerk.  That was horrible.  I'm sorry.  That was terrible.  I'm sorry.  So the porn guy, Detective Tom Goggin, says Buck had filed one previous complaint about  the neighborhood children.  He says they clearly annoy Buck, but adds there's nothing criminal about them playing outside.  And how funny is the detective's name is Goggin.  Goggin.  He's on a porn case and his last name's Goggin. 
[01:53:30]  Goggin.  Yeah.  What do we...  How much noise are kids making out there?  I don't know.  Just think about when...  Where's your fucking windows?  Oh.  Hey, wait a minute.  Hi, old Nicky.  Oh, we got him at the beginning of the hallway.  It's going to be a while because he walks up there.  Hi, little Nicky.  How's it right for?  He's giving us the finger.  He just flipped us the bird.  Oh, little Nicky has arrived at Sirius XM.  It's little Nicky.  What were you saying?  Hmm?  How much noise kids make? 
[01:54:00]  What's the matter?  Who is that?  Little Nicky.  Little Nicky.  I thought that was that guy from American Idol.  The gay guy.  Adam...  No, it's little Nicky.  No, don't change our bit.  You ever see Adam Sandler's movie little Nicky?  Oh, that looked like him.  It's like doing radio with a preschooler.  It's hysterical.  Holy fuck!  Why do you think we're doing that?  We call him little Nicky.  What goes on in your brain?  It just hit me.  It didn't hit you when we said, oh, little Nicky for ten straight minutes? 
[01:54:30]  No, because I didn't realize the movie...  Seven on hole 11.  Oh, shit.  No, that's not a laugh.  You got seven on the back.  That was a laugh.  I just birdied that.  That was a laugh.  That was stupidity.  You got to give him a birdie on stupidity.  Jesus Christ.  I love when he realizes stuff.  Oh!  I know.  Oh, revelation.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh!  One and one is two.  Hey, did you see that movie, Defiance?  That's a good movie.  Yeah.  There's some fucking tough Jews out there. 
[01:55:00]  I like that, the tough Jew thing for World War II.  That was fucking great, man, those dudes.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened then?  Know what I like?  Yeah, what happened?  They all moved to the Upper West Side.  Yeah.  The Israelis are still tough.  Yeah.  But, yeah, that was a good movie.  I like that one.  The best part is when he walked into that house and fucking blew it.  Just shot the fucking Nazi guy.  Yeah.  The kids.  The kids.  It's the wife.  It's great.  Is this the real Kevin Smith?  Yes, of course it's the real Kevin.  Kevin.  Why don't you have our hotline?  I don't know, dude.  This is the only number I ever have on my phone. 
[01:55:30]  And I was between takes, and I was like, oh, it's 830.  They're still on.  And I just wanted to call and say, thanks for pimping the show,  because Carnegie Hall fucking rocked for me.  Bro, let me tell you something.  I was blown away.  It's just you on stage at Carnegie Hall.  They ate you up.  Oh, it was fun, dude.  It was fun.  And you know what?  Sounds delicious.  Because of my dumb hours, I always have to leave events early.  But for the most part, I don't mind.  I was so bummed I had to leave after.  I left around 10, so I missed the last hour. 
[01:56:00]  But I got two good hours there.  It was good, man.  It was such a fun night and great crowd.  Kevin's up there for a long time.  I got there that night when I stepped into Carnegie Hall.  They told me we sold out.  And I was just like, yay.  Yeah, because you're.  It was fun, man.  And you guys made it happen.  And I really wanted to acknowledge you,  because there's at one point somebody was going like,  you know, you haven't been on the other guy's show in a while.  And I bet you if you went on the show, you can instantly sell out.  And that wasn't the kind of selling out I wanted to do. 
[01:56:30]  Do you know what I mean?  Nice.  Ah, nice.  Look at that.  You guys have been really loyal.  And I love going into the show and sitting down.  You guys will let me sit there for like six, five hours.  Kevin's the shit.  Yeah, it really is.  So, you know, thanks a lot.  You guys made a big dream of mine come true.  Oh, man.  Shout out.  That's fantastic.  How cool is this, Kevin?  How's the movie going?  It's great.  We're about 20 minutes away from today's first shot.  We're at the tail end of week four.  Fourth of July is kind of the midway point for us. 
[01:57:00]  It's fucking hysterical, dude.  Tracy, Sean William Scott.  I just ad-libbed a bunch of shit that was just amazingly funny.  Shockingly, the funniest stuff in the movie isn't even the dirty stuff.  I can't even describe it without giving it away.  But it's really fucking funny.  And it looks good.  Nobody's going to believe I shot it.  No, stop.  You know, you're on to something.  I mean, the press is picking up on it.  You're in the paper again today, or Tracy Morgan is. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, and wearing a costume?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It was part of yesterday's shoot, I guess.  They have a nice little picture of Tracy Morgan,  and they mention the movie and everything.  It is kind of nice for the, I mean,  in terms of we are shooting in and around all the Attaburros,  so naturally it's kind of a nice fit for those sections of the paper  where they take a picture of some famous fucker  and who's cuter than Tracy Morgan.  This dude is so adorable in the movie.  But, and Bruce is just crushing it. 
[01:58:00]  It's good, dude.  It's good.  It's really, I don't want to oversell it,  but I think it's going to do something.  You know, tell Sean William Scott that he's due for a visit on our show.  It's been a while.  I will, and he's off this week from us, but here in New York,  so maybe he'll have some time to take away and get in.  He's a good guy.  That dude did some amazingly funny stuff in the movie.  He's a solid dude.  Real funny.  On his way up again, too, by the way.  Yeah, but I mean, he never went down.  The fucker landed and stayed.  Yeah.  I got his, like, I showed him his scene the other day, 
[01:58:30]  and he was just like, oh, my God.  He's like, that is my favorite thing I've ever done.  It's the perfect marriage of character and performer, man.  He crushed it.  What are you doing different in this movie that you like looking at?  It's not my script.  I mean, that's the thing.  It's weird.  You find out, like, you know,  I've always written and directed everything that I've done,  and when it's not, that means that I had it in my head  from the first thought all the way up until we start shooting it,  and you have a very specific visual in your head, 
[01:59:00]  the one that you're married to that you were kind of birthed the idea with.  By shooting somebody else's script, it leaves you all open to, like,  well, I have no vision for it.  I had to kind of create a vision for it for myself  by reading somebody else's work.  It wasn't my idea, so it's like it leaves you more open to collaboration  because I sit there going, well, I can't know everything there is to know about it  because I wasn't there from day one.  So because of that, you'll let a lot more in, and it just makes it better. 
[01:59:30]  That totally makes sense.  Yeah, absolutely.  Cool, man.  Looking forward.  No, it does kind of.  We had a piss in the water.  All right, they're calling me back to work, dude.  Oh, listen to that.  Oh, I love this.  Listen to that.  Kevin calling us in between takes.  Nice.  But I'll check in next week probably.  But, again, thanks a lot.  You guys are so sweet, and thanks for coming.  All right.  Congrats, Kevin.  Take it easy, man.  All right, bud.  I'll take you away.  All right, Kevin Smith.  Oh, shit.  I think he was saying a hey right there. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Never want to hang up on someone that's going hey.  Hey.  Do you think he was going hey, boss?  Do you think he was going to say that?  Probably not.  No.  I kind of froze up.  I wanted to ask him to direct our movie.  No.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I think he's busy.  Yeah.  Bruce Willis.  Yeah.  He's directing Bruce Willis.  Wow.  From one star to another, this is unbelievable.  Just a fine, fine Opie and Anthony show today.  Ladies and gentlemen, on our phones, Bobo.  Jersey's own.  Jersey's own Bobo.  How's everything going?  First of all, I'm not from Jersey, as you guys forgot about. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, he's from Queens.  Oh, you're from Queens.  That's what we heard.  That's what we heard.  Right.  Sorry.  Yeah, I know.  You forgot.  That's just part of that whole Bobo Springsteen bit that I do.  Right, that you do.  Of course.  Right.  Bobo.  Rave reviews on your comedy at the Stress Factory.  Yeah, that's correct.  I've been hearing comments.  I even had, it was even nice enough that they had a couple of my relatives in the audience.  I had my cousin.  We saw that.  His girlfriend. 
[02:01:00]  I also had my aunt along with her husband.  Who, by the way, Anthony, I think you'd appreciate he's a former Marine, by the way.  Oh, wow.  Well, I appreciate all the servicemen and women of our great nation.  We don't want to mess with him.  Of course not.  And I was going to have, my mother was going to be there, but she was sick.  Of you?  Oh.  Oh, Rich.  No, I wasn't talking to this call.  Oh, Rich.  What's wrong with your mom?  No, she was just sick that night. 
[02:01:30]  A little cold, swine flu?  No, not swine flu.  She was really well, all right?  Good for that.  My mom's, because it's kind of weird.  Sometimes she feels well, sometimes she doesn't.  And it was one of those things she didn't feel well.  So she wasn't there.  Right, we get it.  She didn't feel well.  Am I smelling bacon?  Turkey bacon.  Damn it!  I love the smell of bacon.  Yeah.  Isn't that good?  Oh, fuck.  Why didn't I get bacon on my Sambo? 
[02:02:00]  God damn, I went healthy with egg whites, turkey, and a little cheese when I could have  had fucking bacon.  Give me some of your bacon right now.  I touch every piece.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah, I'd do it like this.  Give me a piece of bacon.  Just replace it with Nicorette gum on there.  Bobo, we put your video up on my YouTube channel, OP Radio, of you warming up the Stress  Factory for Rich Voss.  Oh, that's good to know.  I got to see it.  I'm sorry I didn't...  By the way...  Hopefully you can't read the comments. 
[02:02:30]  I didn't call earlier, because I told you the situation, how I don't have my home kit  yet...  What's a home kit?  Home kit?  No, listen to it.  Listen to my ex at home, because I told you to replace the one that got damaged.  I've been borrowing receivers on and off.  They should give you a free unit with all the good entertainment you're giving us.  Of course.  Series XM's got to figure that out.  If someone's giving us really good stuff, they should get a free unit.  Yeah, I know.  I got...  Oh, my God.  Turkey bacon tastes like regular bacon. 
[02:03:00]  Really?  I got...  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he just as bad.  I got it.  I'm sure.  I got a unit, but unfortunately, they could...  I couldn't...  Yeah, we saw you.  I got a unit, but you can't see it.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about...  No, no, no.  Spider-Man.  Oh, right.  I get it now.  When are you going to be performing next?  Because you're onto something with this comedy.  Well, I don't know when next, but I'll...  Something, all right.  I'll figure out over the course of time, but believe me, that was the beginning.  Why did you walk out in the middle of my show, the second show? 
[02:03:30]  Why did you leave?  Voss, that was because my aunt had to leave, because she was taking care of her...  My grandmother was taking care of her daughter, and she didn't want to keep my grandmother up so long.  Was taking care of your daughter?  No, no, no, not my daughter.  My aunt's daughter.  Oh, oh.  My little cousin, Emma.  Oh, little Emma.  Oh, little Emma. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You know, when you're doing stand-up, like, the best stand-up comics are ones that are honest, right?  And they tell, like, real-life stories.  Like, one time when I was young, my cousin and I, you know what I mean?  Like, weird stuff, or like, have you ever done anything gay in your life, maybe?  Well, he had some gay stuff with his brother.  You had gay stuff with your brother?  No, no, no, no.  See? 
[02:04:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  He talked about it last time on the air.  Yeah, last Friday.  Last Friday, he brought up the gay thing with his brother.  He told us two things last Friday, that he jizzes in his pants, and he had some kind of gay thing with his brother.  Guys, guys, I said that wasn't true.  No, no, no.  So, what happened was...  We remember when you talked about being gay with your brother.  Yeah, we're just telling Rich what you said Friday.  That time you said on Friday when you were gay with your brother.  Yeah, you said that you jizzed in your pants when you slept, and that there was some kind of gay thing with your brother.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You're a kid, you're exploring.  No, no, no, there wasn't. 
[02:05:00]  There wasn't.  My new favorite thing ever.  There wasn't anything gay going on.  No, you don't have to call it gay, like, kissing or something like that.  But when you went down on each other, when you talked about that, when you talked about being gay with your brother, with the...  What?  That didn't happen.  Okay, when you were alone.  Hold on, I know what he's trying to say.  You know, they were experimenting, they were young, so it's not really gay.  Yeah.  It was a gay act, but it doesn't mean you're gay. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, it's like a gay act, Bobo.  There was nothing gay going on.  Bobo, it's like when you and your brother get together and touch each other in a sexual way,  I understand what you're saying, it's not gay, but when you did that and talked about it last week, that's what we're talking about.  Right, right.  Bobo, when you say it's not gay, when you're saying it's not gay, go explain to us.  First say, Nurse Ratched, this is what happened.  Right, Nurse Ratched, this is what happened. 
[02:06:00]  That didn't even happen at all.  Oh, the Nurse Ratched thing, but the gay thing with your brother when you were younger.  How old were you when the gay thing happened with your brother?  That gay thing never happened at all.  Oh.  No, you said it did Friday.  You were in here, Bobo, you were in here saying that you had gay sex with your brother.  I remember you said that.  They misheard the words that I said.  They misheard the words that I said.  All right, we're a little confused.  So you used to jizz in your pants, right? 
[02:06:30]  Right, but that's a whole other thing, all right?  Who hasn't?  So, in your pants or line?  Well, we're all raising our hands.  No, who hasn't in their own pants, all right?  Who hasn't, all right?  Who hasn't been with their brother?  Me.  No, I said who hasn't jizzed in their pants.  All right, so when you're sleeping in the same bed as your brother, you used to jizz in your pants then?  No, I didn't say that.  There was no good thing going on, all right? 
[02:07:00]  There was no good thing on it.  You used to do this all day?  I loved it.  Who the heck did that do that?  All day.  Who do you think I am?  Jimmy?  Who do you think I am?  Jimmy playing Monster Rain?  Whoa.  Wait till I tell Jimmy that when he comes back tomorrow.  Man.  You're not going to be happy.  No, you ain't going to be happy with that.  Who do you think?  So, all right, so it's safe to say you did at least sleep in the same bed as your brother  and you used to jizz your pants.  No.  Jizz in your pants. 
[02:07:30]  That I can't say really because I hardly have any memories of my brother because, as I said  the last time I told him.  Oh, oh.  Well, you repressed everything because of the gay sex, right?  No, no.  Yeah, when you have the gay sex, you put that in the back of your mind.  Yeah, I don't blame you for forgetting that stuff.  That's not fun to remember.  It wasn't that because it was three and a half years old the last time I had seen him.  Oh, that's disgusting then.  God, how could you be so young and have sex with your brother? 
[02:08:00]  No, no, no, that's just not happening.  You're crying, guys.  I told you Sam was just twisting what I was saying.  Sam was just mixing.  He mixed up what I said, all right?  All day.  I was saying one thing.  He reacts to you.  I can't wait to do it.  And he heard.  I said, I said, let's go.  Because what he's trying to do is get a word in.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what Sam said.  When you fooled around with him, did he ever fall out of the crib?  I never fooled around with anybody. 
[02:08:30]  So when you and your brother were sword fighting.  No, no, no.  That never even.  You would sword fight with him where you take your penises and make like their swords and  touch them together.  Right.  That's not gay.  It's not gay.  It's not gay.  It's playing around.  It's not gay if you've touched helmets with your brother.  Yeah.  So you touched helmets with him.  Who cares?  That never even happened.  No, you're like a musketeer.  You're sword fighting.  It's almost masculine.  Did you meet your brother after Friday's show? 
[02:09:00]  What?  Did I see him?  Yeah.  I was talking to him before.  Oh, really?  No, but you were meeting up with him on Friday.  You were excited.  You were all cleaned up.  You had poofy hair.  You didn't have the hat on.  You didn't have the Mets jacket on.  You had a nice shirt on.  Yeah, exactly.  Everything that happened before, I headed out to Jersey.  We were eating pizza.  Oh, yeah?  Why did you get dressed up so nice?  You were hoping to bring back the old times of having gay sex with him? 
[02:09:30]  No, no, it was because I felt that I had to look appropriate for the first time I had seen him in ages.  Yeah, I understand.  I felt I had to look a little sexy.  You had to look a little sexy to turn him on a little bit.  Back like the old days.  Yeah.  When you would be with him.  Just stop making up.  Stop making up.  No, no, I'm not making up.  This is exactly what you said Friday.  I'll pull the tape.  You said you had gay sex with your brother. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  That's a crazy story.  Why aren't you doing that in your comedy act?  Remember when you said that Friday when you said that?  Do you remember?  Friday you said that you...  Anthony, I'm thinking he should bring this to his comedy act.  I know.  You could get some humor out of the fact you had gay sex with your brother.  It's honesty, but at least...  Yeah, people love honest comedy, man.  I'd be surprised.  So many people relate to it.  How old were you when this happened, Bobo?  Yeah, how old were you guys?  What, like 10, 11, when you touched each other? 
[02:10:30]  That never happened at all.  There was never any gay stuff going on.  You're not a bad person.  Yeah, but I'm just saying there was never any gay stuff going on.  Yeah, it doesn't make you a bad person.  It really does.  You're not a bad person.  You know, that's what I'm saying.  I know there wasn't gay stuff going on.  You don't have to call it gay.  It's just...  It's that brotherly thing.  Well, they're still trying to...  Where you're touching each other's penises with your mouth.  Yeah, Bobo, it might be a technicality.  They're still trying to figure out if docking is indeed a gay act.  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  The scientists aren't really sure yet.  They're still doing their experiments.  So you grabbed each other's...  Wieners?  Wieners.  And you pulled that...  And you tugged on them.  As they said, guys, that...  That...  What?  No, but you said Friday.  Wait.  Remember when you said Friday that you had touched your brother inappropriately?  They touched Wieners?  Yeah.  Bobo and his brother?  That's what he said Friday.  Pull the tape and you'll hear it, Bobo.  That's wild stuff, Bobo.  Bobo, remember when you said that? 
[02:11:30]  Do you remember saying that?  Because I heard you say that.  No, I see.  I see that.  I see that for the right price.  I see that for the right price.  But when you were on Friday, you said that you had touched each other inappropriately  when you were younger.  And that's what was going to weird you out when you saw him again.  Remember?  I didn't see that guy.  I didn't see that guy.  He's exhausted.  I didn't see that guy.  He's exhausted.  Bobo, what are you promoting?  Because we've got to move on. 
[02:12:00]  Danny, find Bobo doing jizz in his pants, his version.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think we've played it on the radio yet.  Are you going to the Gay Pride Parade this weekend?  No, no, no.  I'm not going that.  Why not?  I'm going to the Mets game this weekend.  I'm going to be there on Friday.  Is it gay night at the Mets game at Citi Field?  Are you wearing a gay night?  Are you wearing your pink Mets cap in honor of a gay night?  No, it isn't that.  I'm wearing the blue Mets hat and my orange shirt.  You blew who?  My blue Mets hat. 
[02:12:30]  Who'd you blow?  No, my blue Mets hat.  You blew the Mets?  No, no.  My Mets hat.  You know what I have to say.  Jesus, Bobo.  How much gay sex are you having?  God, Bobo, you love the cock.  Save some for the rest of us.  Bobo loves the cock.  Jesus.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm a pussy guy.  No, we were reading your Twitter.  Why else would you want people to meet you on a subway platform?  No, you're looking at me on a subway like Harvey fucking milk.  Yeah, Jesus Christ. 
[02:13:00]  You travel with your own glory hole?  Yeah, how much recruiting are you doing, Bobo?  Yeah, come on, Bobo.  What are you doing?  No, that isn't the reason why I wanted to greet.  Save some of this HIV for the rest of us.  Help, yeah.  No, it isn't that because I'm waiting for my friend that has the tickets.  Oh.  The tickets.  The tickets.  Is that the code word?  Right.  You got the tickets and then the cock goes in your mouth.  Are you wearing a blue or yellow handkerchief?  I thought when you said tickets, you were talking about, you know, a sporting event.  But now we understand.  Tickets. 
[02:13:30]  Wink, wink.  We got it, Bobo.  Yeah.  We speak your language now.  I'm actually talking about tickets, all right?  But I'm saying if fans want...  If fans want...  Want blowjobs.  Want to greet someone famous.  If they want blowjobs, what?  If they want to greet...  Your host, is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  I said if fans want to greet someone famous,  they might find me waiting for the guy that has the tickets.  So are you...  Why is he famous?  I'm saying...  I'm saying... 
[02:14:00]  Well, I've kind of become now.  You are pretty famous and a lot of entertainers,  once they get famous like you,  come out of the closet and people don't care  because they know you're an artist and a lot of artists are gay.  Well, I could say that I'm straight.  And I'm all about the pussy.  Bobo, I know a lot of people know you now by the name Bobo.  Can we call you Blow Blow, though?  Now, can we just call you Blow Blow  because of your gay experiences?  How about homo?  No, I'm not gay. 
[02:14:30]  No?  I think it rolls off the tongue, literally, with you.  Blow Blow.  Hey, Blow Blow.  Hey, when are you coming in, Blow Blow?  Blow Blow.  You're coming in Friday, Blow Blow?  Yeah, I'm coming in...  I'm going to be there Friday.  All right, a Blow Blow is coming in Friday, Opie.  I can't wait to see Blow Blow.  Who can't wait to see Blow Blow?  Very funny.  Very funny.  I got to punch out, guys.  I got to go...  Oh.  All right, what are you promoting? 
[02:15:00]  I'm promoting my appearance at the game.  But you're not a man.  You got a seat number.  You can give out.  You are a pisser, man.  No, no, no, no, no.  His appearance at the game.  He's going to the baseball game.  I'm not giving out.  You just got to find me.  You just got to...  All you got to do is find me.  Oh, God.  He's a scream, man.  You're looking for me by the subway.  I'm waiting for the guy with the ticket.  I'm plugging my clothes buying Monday. 
[02:15:30]  I'll be out buying a shirt.  You'll be at the Walmart.  He's plugging the fact that he's going to be in the men's game.  Bobo is amazing.  Or Blow Blow, sorry.  We're all trying to listen better, but I really missed this.  Ken in Texas writes, line of the day, Bobo travels with his own glory hole.  Who said that?  I'm fucking rich.  His own glory hole.  How do you do that?  You just said it out.  That's funny.  It's like a cartoon.  It's like a traveling. 
[02:16:00]  It unfolds.  All right, Momo.  All right, Glo Blow.  If you haven't gone to Citi Field yet, please go.  Yeah, please go.  It wasn't a mistake you going to the Philly Stadium before you went to Citi Field.  You're a Mets fan.  You went to enemy territory first.  And by the way, I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Hey, Bobo, you don't mind if we start calling you Bobo the homo, do you?  No, don't call me that. 
[02:16:30]  Hey, have a good time at the game, Bro Blow.  All right.  All right.  Take it easy.  You blew your brother.  So you're Bro Blow.  Holy shit.  That's good.  Perfect.  Bro Blow.  Wait, Bro Blow.  Hey, Bro Blow.  You coming in Friday, Bro Blow?  Yeah, I am.  All right.  Good.  Good thing, Bro Blow.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Take your time, slow-mo.  All right, Bro Blow.  After the show.  I could do that all fucking day.  After the show Friday, I filmed Bobo singing his version of Jizz in My Pants. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, listen to this.  Hey, Bobo, what do you got for us today?  I got the Bobo version of the song Jizz in My Pants.  Oh, let's hear that.  I woke up, found myself dreaming about the girl that I wanted to score with in high school,  and I jizzed in my pants.  Walked down Grand Avenue in Massacre, and I saw Leah walking by, and I jizzed in my pants.  Fell asleep.  Fell asleep.  My cousin turned on the porno film, full blast, and I jizzed in my pants. 
[02:17:30]  I used to wear a rubber in my sleep, because in high school, I had a problem.  Jizzed in my pants.  I jizzed right in my pants every time I think of her.  When I, when she sees, when she walks past me, it's like having sex with me.  And I, I wear a rubber at all times, especially when she calls, because I jizzed in my pants.  Woke, woke, woke, woke up, woke up through porn film, because I jizzed in my pants.  Hurt, hurt, hurt the upstairs neighbors effing so loud that I jizzed in my pants. 
[02:18:00]  Woke up, see the top, I got welled on Wednesday, because I jizzed in my pants.  Every time I get welled, I jizzed in my pants.  Woke, saw a hot chick with the biggest tits I ever seen, and I jizzed in my pants.  Saw a hot chick that was going fiddling herself, and I jizzed in my pants.  I caught a lesbian couple kissing, and I jizzed in my pants.  These girls were trying to hit on me, and I jizzed in my pants. 
[02:18:30]  I watched the Girls Gone Wild video, and I jizzed in my pants.  When I watched the Purr of Soulful Sex tape, I jizzed in my pants.  When I was looking for internet porn, I jizzed in my pants.  As soon as I logged on to porn.com, I jizzed in my pants.  Holy shit.  He throws his head back like someone's jizzing in his face.  Yeah, he does like a move.  You gotta see the move, yeah.  He does his whiplash thing when he says, jizzed in my pants.  Wow, is he fucking just a star. 
[02:19:00]  Look how cute that guitar player is in the middle.  Oh, you missed her.  Fuck.  Who are they?  The Rolling Stones.  I jizzed in my pants.  I saw Keith Richards.  Oh, man.  No, not that one, no, no.  Hold on.  No, but look at her.  Not her, the other one.  Wait till you see the other one.  What band is this?  That's hot.  Look at the one with the purple.  What band is this?  It's a chick band.  Yeah.  KSM, Travis, anything on that?  If they're on the CW11, they're not really popular yet. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, okay.  Damn.  Look at her.  Look at that.  Are you kidding me?  Nah, she's a little too Long Island trash looking.  Jersey trash.  That's what I'm saying.  The hair's too curly.  I thought they were going to kiss.  Yeah, and like her face too is a little.  Yeah, maybe.  A little Jersey-ish.  She kind of looks like my daughter.  Jersey.  I was going to say that.  She looks like my oldest kid.  A couple of these girls look like your daughter.  Daughters.  All right.  We got Brett.  Oh, that's got to be the drummer.  Who the?  Or the fat chick.  There's always chick bands with the drummer. 
[02:20:00]  You're just like, oh.  You would think with all that drumming, she wouldn't be as fat.  I know.  Who wants half a Sambo?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  Or Sambo.  Let's keep that fucking off of the radio here.  Or Sandwich.  Come on now.  Who wants half of my sandwich?  Oh, look how great they look in the picture.  What band is this?  Do we know?  KSM.  That's the name of the band.  Wow, exciting news.  I watched KSM and I gizzed in my band.  Rosie O'Donnell's going to be doing a show at Sirius XM.  Oh, great.  Oh. 
[02:20:30]  We'll take a break.  We'll continue with Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.com for all his comedy dates.  You got it.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's too funny, man. 
[02:21:00]  That fucking Bobo, man.  Rich Voss helping us out.  Jimmy's back tomorrow.  I guess we'll find out why he was gone all week.  Maybe something's going on.  Why?  I don't know.  He didn't call me.  Well, he didn't call me either.  He usually texts.  I was very worried.  He's fucking great, man.  People either.  He's one of those guys. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, it's got to be acknowledged that the fans or the listeners love or hate.  There's not been one person we've had as a semi or regular guest on this show that hasn't had that, though.  For all the people that love them or hate them.  For all the people that say they changed the channel when he's on, there's someone right there next to you saying, I turn up the fucking channel.  And that's the...  That's radio gold.  But that's the...  That is the honest truth. 
[02:22:00]  You could do four hours of stuttering and just laugh.  It's not...  He's just trying to get the point out that he didn't have gay sex with his brother.  We're accusing him of having gay sex with his brother.  He just wants the world to know it's not true.  And it's...  And it gets louder and louder.  Oh.  Bro blow.  That was the best one.  Bro blow.  Hey, bro blow.  See you later, bro blow.  Mr. Met8.  Yeah.  If you want to follow him on Twitter. 
[02:22:30]  M-R-Met number eight.  And he will...  Jesus, boss.  And his tweets...  You don't shit in yourself?  He's a guy that could tweet without a picture.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  What he writes is still very interesting.  Do you follow him?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Mr. Met8 rocks.  Yeah, you gotta follow him.  Give me some of his tweets.  600 followers.  Oh, the 600th follower gets a gift card to Ted's porn.  Emporium.  Emporium.  He spelt it.  Nothing with an E.  It was Emporium. 
[02:23:00]  I want everybody to know...  Where's his little name?  They're doing...  That's my stapler.  My stapler.  But I did not ask for salt.  I don't want salt on my...  My jig.  I would burn the place down.  All right.  Listen closely to this story.  You can see the boy writhing on the floor, almost convulsing, 
[02:23:30]  as church elders from Manifested Glory Ministries  try to physically drive out his sexual orientation,  invoking the devil's name, Lucifer.  Right now, I command you to leave.  Patricia McKinney, who calls herself a prophetess,  is seen here on the church website with her husband, Kelvin.  She denied the ritual was an exorcism,  claiming the boy was once in reform school for stealing  and wanted the church to cast his demons out.  Right now, in the name of Jesus. 
[02:24:00]  I call my homosexuality right now, in the name of Jesus.  But the images on the 20-minute video  have one local group planning to report the church  to the Connecticut Department of Children and Families.  They thought they were trying to help him,  and I think what they did was murder his soul.  Murder his soul?  Wow.  All right, you could relax a little bit on that.  Yeah, maybe manslaughter, but not straight-out murder.  Oh, there's a whole video of it and everything?  You homosexual demon!  Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, 
[02:24:30]  the blood of Jesus!  Wow, this is a wacky church.  Who's rolling around the floor?  The homo?  Is that Bobo?  Trying to get his brother's demon out of his body?  If you go outside, you hear the neighbors yelling,  get out of our neighborhood.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit! 
[02:25:00]  There's another exorcism outside.  Yeah, right outside.  Right outside the fucking front door.  I cast ye out of the neighborhood.  You take your property, decreasing value down, church.  You leave.  Wow, that is fucked up.  Yeah, we got more to the story here.  Tonight, no one answered the door at the church's Bridgeport property,  but our Connecticut affiliate tried to question Prophetess McKinney 
[02:25:30]  at the site of her weekly radio show.  She wasn't showing her...  What is that move?  What is that?  I can't see what was going on there.  Dude, it looks like the guy's getting it up the ass.  Yeah, with a sheet.  He's holding him from behind.  Oh, he is.  He's showing him the evil of his ways, I guess, by banging him.  They're fighting gay with gay.  We want a clean spirit.  Get out of the way.  Wow, and he's spinning around on the floor.  They're getting these sheets and throwing the sheets over him for some reason. 
[02:26:00]  You'd think they wouldn't like that.  Maybe.  Tonight, no one answered the door at the church's Bridgeport property,  but our Connecticut affiliate tried to question Prophetess McKinney  at the site of her weekly radio show.  She wasn't showing her spiritual side.  We're not coming where we're at and looking for no interview.  But Patricia McKinney did speak to the Associated Press Wire service,  and she said that the church took care of the young man 
[02:26:30]  and gave him clothing because he was dressing like a girl  and he didn't want to do that anymore.  And on her radio show today, she noted,  if you're a true prophet, you're not going to be popular with the people.  Wait, aren't you allowed to do exorcisms like this?  What's the problem?  Well, they're kind of looking at it like it's some kind of a bad thing for the kid.  Yeah, leave the homo in the kid.  Yeah, leave him alone.  Just leave the homo in him.  Let him be gay.  Let him be gay.  That's probably what he says to his partner. 
[02:27:00]  There's something inside me that tells me you're gay.  And it could be your fist.  Don't worry.  The gay will be out of you in 15 minutes.  Wow.  That's a long gayness.  Well, isn't there places they could send you to, like Gay Bootcamp?  Oh, yeah, they got that shit.  Where they'll get the gayness.  Yeah, they try to get the gay out of you.  What they do is they get a bunch of young gay men and put them together in a barracks. 
[02:27:30]  And then try to get the gay out of them.  Try to get the gay out of them.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, the place just smells like fucking balls and cum in the morning.  Because the guy would turn the lights off for the night sometime.  Yeah.  Good night, ladies.  Right.  I don't think that would get it.  Why don't they throw some women in there or something?  Why is Private Joker fucking Private Pile in the ass?  They put them all together.  A butt plug! 
[02:28:00]  Oh, God.  What have we got here?  Oh, I know him.  A butt plug.  Look at that.  He's putting it through a zipper.  You eat it.  What?  Rich, you're a horrendous actor.  I know.  That was good.  Wasn't that?  When he sees a picture that is uber gay, Rich always coughs and goes, oh, look at that.  It's not the blowjobs, it's the making out that's gross.  That's fucking, that's gay.  That's gay.  That isn't.  But this is fine? 
[02:28:30]  What?  Look at that.  No, that, anal is gay and making out is gay.  Oral is exploring.  What are you trying to find there, Magellan?  Oral is just.  All right, let's show Rich some gay pictures.  And you tell us if it's gay or, what's the other one?  Exploring?  Exploring.  Exploring.  Okay.  He's just leaving.  What are you getting?  Steve's collection?  No, he's got it.  Oh, he's closing the curtains.  Yeah, we have to close the curtains.  Gay pictures. 
[02:29:00]  Hold on, let me get my phone.  Are they serious?  Yeah, we have to close the curtains.  Yes, literally.  I know.  Serious.  That's the new thing.  It's so dumb.  We've got to close the curtains.  This isn't a real job.  There's a gay exorcism going on in here.  First mistake, thinking this is a real job.  Pay me!  Oh, another consulting fee.  That's right.  Stop making believe this is a real job.  That was good acting, though.  When I cough like that.  Horrendous.  You do it all the time.  I finally have to tell you.  No, sometimes.  Louis beans.  Oh, my God.  I'm coughing.  Louis beans. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  Gay or exploring?  Oh, gay.  That's gay.  Gay guy, Louis beans.  That's gay.  That's not gay.  All right.  Wait.  Explain what's gay and what's not gay.  Who's gay in that picture?  Right.  The guy banging the other guy in the butt is gay.  All right.  Who's gay in there, though?  Who's what?  Which guy is gay in that?  The two.  These two right there where you can just see balls.  Who's gayer?  And the guy watching, jerking off.  Not gay.  Just exploring.  Experiment. 
[02:30:00]  You know, he's really not gay like they are because he's not making contact.  That guy is literally balls deep.  I know.  It's almost.  It is.  It is behind a shot.  It is the guy.  He's like power banging this guy.  He's just.  And the guy's balls below him looks like Mr. Potato Head without the eyes and the nose.  Yeah, it's really.  I've never seen balls that big.  It looks like a tumor on his ass.  But that guy. 
[02:30:30]  And look at that cock.  That is a nice cock if you're going to do.  I mean, it's kind of.  Jesus.  All right.  Let's.  Let's.  Let's.  But that guy.  Give Richard another picture there.  Okay.  By the way, the guy you said that wasn't gay because he's exploring.  He was ready to get head from the other guy, by the way.  He wasn't just jerking off.  Oh.  God.  How do you know when you saw this?  He was like guiding it into the guy's mouth.  Yeah.  He's got eyes.  No, he was spanking out alone right there.  I don't.  I don't know.  All right.  Jesus. 
[02:31:00]  These curtains are closed.  We're looking at this.  I feel like I should have tokens.  Earl doesn't work here anymore.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  I don't think the bit's going to work, Rich.  I'm sorry.  All right.  What about that?  All right.  Two army guys.  What's gay about that?  Don't tell.  Here's what's gay about that.  What's not gay about it.  All right.  The act that they're doing isn't real gay.  The way they're dressed up, they're trying to be. 
[02:31:30]  It makes them look gay, putting on army outfits like that.  Wait.  So the guy that has a cock in his mouth, that's not gay.  Not as gay as wearing the outfits like that.  Like, oh, we're army men sucking dick.  That's gay.  Okay.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Do you get the connection?  You did tell us you bought those crazy pants, though, for golf.  Yeah.  But I'm not going to, I'm not going to, before I putt, blow the other player.  All right.  You know, I bought many, I bought a lot of plastic soldiers as a kid, and I never remember  that crew. 
[02:32:00]  I remember the radio operator, the laying down guy.  I don't remember the sucking the soldier dick guy in my soldier set.  Well, see, that's the difference.  My army men were from the Don't Ask, Don't Tell collection.  Oh, is that it?  Okay.  Rich, we got it.  Oh, God.  All right.  What about this picture?  Explain the picture first for the listeners.  It's a young boy that won the lottery, it looks like.  Look at him.  He's holding, this guy.  This one guy is sitting down, he still has his underpants on. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And two guys completely naked standing in front of him, and he's got his hand on.  Both are asses.  Okay.  Both are ass cheeks.  This guy, who's pure white, like, you don't want to grab it that by.  Look how disgusting.  But this guy with the tan line, that ass, if you close your eyes, could feel like a woman's  ass.  Look how round and tight it is.  Look at that.  I mean, look at that ass right there.  I mean, I'm not lying.  That's not gay.  That's a nice body. 
[02:33:00]  It's just a nice body.  You're going to keep talking to someone who agrees with you, because we'll be here all  day.  We'll be here all day.  Yeah.  You hear him?  Like, he, this, if these two guys went off alone, that would be gay.  But this guy right here, he's just a dude with a nice, you know.  Rich Foster's explaining this, like, you know, he's explaining why the Rolling Stones are better  than the Beatles, and eventually we'll go, oh, you know what?  You're right, Rich.  You made a point.  You made a point.  And I'm pointing where my class is like a professor.  I see that.  Look how far up the butt cheek out of that guy's asshole he's chafed. 
[02:33:30]  Like, that is just a lot of dick has been in that.  The guy on the right.  Like, you could see where Ground Zero is on his ass cheeks.  Well, right here you can see a little redness.  Yes.  He's a little tender.  He's tender.  He must have done a...  One more, Rich, and we'll wrap up this amazing bit.  Oh, this is kind of gay.  The whole bit is gay.  Now, see, that's the whole thing.  Now, the bit itself.  Gay or curious?  Gay.  I'm like, so gay.  Thank God the music's manning it up. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, a comic has it.  Okay, this isn't my line.  This is another comics, and I don't know whose line it is.  Okay.  So, he goes, you know you're gay.  Oh, gay?  That's...  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  Gay or not?  Holy smoke.  It's a jizz waterfall.  Oh.  That looks like a fucking strudel icing dispenser. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Rich and his fake puking again.  That one isn't fake.  That, I gather...  If that doesn't get you sick.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you've convinced us all, Rich.  Post-anal sex.  Look at that.  Apparently, the guy had just pulled out.  No.  And there's a little stream of jizz...  A pimple pop in his ass.  ...pouring out of his ass down his ball sack.  Oh, that's...  From the rear, they're showing it.  What's your line there, Rich?  It's not my line.  Yeah.  Rich, what do you think?  That's disgusting.  All right.  That makes you not want to be gay when you see something like that.  And you did before. 
[02:35:00]  I've never used...  Not want to be.  No, that is not good for promotions.  For gay promotions.  You don't think they should use that as...  That's not good gay promotions.  It is called cum.  What is the label there?  What's it called?  Cum in my ass?  No, the label...  I think it says cum from the ass.  Oh, cum from the ass.  All right.  Well, then it makes perfect sense.  All right, Rich.  What's the line that isn't yours?  It's not mine.  I don't know what comma said it, but it's brilliant.  He goes, you know you're gay when you're sucking a guy's dick and you're thinking of another  guy. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  Who said that?  I don't know.  I wish I knew it.  How do we get a hold of him?  What?  What about this guy?  What the fuck?  What is that?  What the fuck is that?  Oh, God.  I can't even look at that.  The guy's growing berries in his ass.  Apparently, there's some hemorrhoid problems with this gentleman.  Yeah, I think he's had a little too much dick.  Vince A. from Bayonne writes, next on Oprah, it's homespun.  Got to use the word homespun. 
[02:36:00]  Homespun.  Word of the day, homespun.  Next on Oprah, it's homespun homosexual justification stories from Rich Voss.  What the fuck was that in that guy's ass?  I want to move on.  Yeah, that's gross.  So there was a gay exorcism in what?  A church in Connecticut?  Yeah, apparently.  A gay exorcism.  I'm trying to get the gay out.  Jesus Christ.  Completely ridiculous.  God damn.  Look at his big stupid feet over his ass.  You know, these are someone's kids.  You know, on the internet, there's millions and millions of pictures of porn. 
[02:36:30]  Where are all these people at?  Like, how come?  Where are all these people's parents?  No, not their parents.  How come you never meet these?  Like, you know what I'm saying?  You don't just bump into them while you recognize every face?  You remember one where you got a photographic memory?  One of these fucking guys can walk right past you on the street.  Not the guys, the girls.  Rich is just bummed.  He can't meet these people.  Yeah, right.  No, I'm talking about girls.  Where is this?  Which one do you really want to meet, Rich?  The girls?  The jizz pouring out of his bum hole. 
[02:37:00]  Which one?  Yeah.  Or all tight ass?  Yeah, I wonder what his next appearance is.  Yeah.  All right, can we move on?  Yeah, I can't.  Oh, why?  This is going great.  Is it?  I like these pictures.  I can't take it anymore.  It's gross.  Wow.  That's rough.  Oh, home invasion time, man.  Oh, thank God.  This is something I could sink my teeth into.  You love home invasions, right?  Yeah.  You're secretly hoping for a home invasion?  Never.  For real?  I would never hope for that.  That's horrid. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  What a nightmare that would be.  Make sure I get that out there.  No, I just am prepared just in case there is one.  Sure.  Do you walk around your house carrying a piece on you?  You know, sometimes if I'm in a situation.  He doesn't really want to discuss details of how he protects his home.  But if there, yeah, I don't want to go over to national security there at my house.  But sometimes, let's just say, if I'm in a situation where escape would be difficult if I was invaded, 
[02:38:00]  then I decide I should probably have a weapon near me.  Yeah.  But what time of the day would escape be more difficult than another time of the day?  Any time of day doesn't matter.  Oh, any day of the week.  It happens all the time.  You never know.  I'm talking about if I'm downstairs in my studio.  Yeah.  And I'm doing something.  I have no exit.  There's no exit.  There is one door.  If someone decided to come in at a house somehow and get down the stairs and get to that door, I have no exit. 
[02:38:30]  Okay, so there's no exit.  So what if that person comes down the stair, his name is Fire.  What, Fire?  Yeah.  I think I have fire alarms and stuff that would go off.  They would go off before there's flames licking at my door, and then I could go out the back exit.  Okay, but you wouldn't run out.  If there was a home invasion, you're not the kind of person that's going to run out the back door.  Oh, you know.  Escape is always the first and foremost thing.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  If you could safely get yourself away from a situation, that's what you do.  Deadly physical force is a last resort.  Last resort.  Even if someone's in your home, which it gives you legal right to, you know, do them bodily harm if, you know, they're in your house.  You don't want to have to deal with that.  But, you know, yeah, clean up and, you know.  Then you've got to walk around.  Remember when I killed that guy and he was right here?  So say you run out of your house, and now, like, two months later you call, can I come back? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, can I please come to my house?  Can I have my house back?  Can I have my house back?  But, no, I would, if it was at night and I was at home and bed and there's nowhere to go, then you've got to, you know, got to stick up for yourself.  You've got to defend your shit and your loved ones, which means, could be, you know, maybe taking a few pot shots there.  So you don't have, like, do you sleep with, like, a bulletproof glass around you and stuff? 
[02:40:00]  No, it would be nice, though.  I might add that feature in.  Wouldn't that be great?  Where it just drops down, bulletproof?  No, I have a gun that is there at night, special, just for the gun.  When you're sound asleep and you wake up.  My alarm's set.  Alarm's set, please.  If the alarm goes off, I'm fucking, I'm up as a pup.  You don't think that good criminals can get through an alarm system?  Have you seen all these movies and shit, you know, like Oceans 11 and 12?  Yeah, you see the part of the movie where the guy fucking shoots the guy when he comes into his fucking bedroom? 
[02:40:30]  My bedroom door's locked, too.  So now come through that fucking door, motherfucker.  It's one entrance.  She's got a panic room, basically.  And I have a place for cover.  Yeah, she's got it all figured out, right?  I can sink back.  I have a rally point.  And I have an Alamo.  And that's it.  Someone tries to come.  I have all the cover in the world.  They have none.  And I have a laser sight on a .45 caliber pistol.  Bye-bye.  Just say bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Your panic room, what do you mean?  Like, you can go into a room that cannot be entered. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  Yes, Rich.  That's what it is.  Fucking cool.  Do you have a fallout shelter, too, built yet?  No, I'm working on that.  The commies aren't really much of a threat anymore.  But the race wars and stuff.  I do have to get the armored car little hatches that you stick your gun through.  Nice.  Put in the door so I can, you know, I could start blasting at legs and kneecaps.  He's getting that.  While they come through.  Well, anyway, home invasions.  You never know whose house you're trying to break into. 
[02:41:30]  And that's the key to this story.  Yes.  Two men broke into this Lehigh home around 1 o'clock Monday morning.  One pointed a gun right at the resident's face while he was in bed.  Screamed at me, don't move.  Don't move.  With vulgarities involved.  That wasn't happening in my house.  He came to the wrong party.  The victim, who wishes to remain unidentified, is a retired special operations officer for the Coast Guard.  His fiancee, who was also in bed, is a former maximum security corrections officer. 
[02:42:00]  We weren't just going to lay down and let them rob us.  Absolutely not.  I worked too hard for the things I have.  Holy shit.  You fucked with the wrong bull tonight.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, special for the Coast Guard.  Former special ops.  So what did he do?  Did he get a boat?  He fucking got a cutter and ran him over.  What the fuck?  What, did he throw a life preserver at him?  He picked up a dirty tire out of the water and threw it over him. 
[02:42:30]  He got him with an inner tube.  The male victim and one of the suspects got in a fight.  He hurt his ear with this.  Ow.  You're hurting my ear.  He chased him along the jetty.  The male victim and one of the suspects got in a fight, both trying to get control of the gun. 
[02:43:00]  Of course.  The other suspect ran out of the house.  Meanwhile, the victim's fiancee grabbed their own rifle and beat the other suspect so hard the rifle broke in two.  Then the male victim got a hold of the suspect's gun.  At that point, I was going to take his life, and he begged for his life.  I don't want to die.  I don't want to die.  Please don't kill me.  Let me go.  Let me go.  Kneecap him.  That's when he took the suspect outside and bashed his head into the truck before the man ran away. 
[02:43:30]  But not before the suspect was able to fire two more shots at the house, one going through the door and grazing the male victim's shoulder.  Fucker.  Lee County Sheriff's Office is still searching for the suspects.  And as for the victims, they say what they did was risky, but because of their law enforcement training, they knew how to react.  Kneecap him.  They fucked it up.  They fucked it up.  Totally fucked it up.  The guy's begging for his life, so you go, all right, I'm not going to take your life.  And then you bash his head in.  Take him outside?  Take him.  And then let him run away, and he's shooting at your house? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  Why the fuck you just didn't call the cops?  At that point, you hold him for the cops, at the very least.  Don't kill him.  And that fucking Benedict Robber begs for his life, and then he fucking...  Who?  Benedict Robber.  Like Benedict Arnold.  You know?  You know what I mean?  Benedict Arnold.  But he said Benedict or something.  Yeah, Benedict Arnold.  I think that's on the chart already, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  Okay.  All right.  Just checking.  It's like concentration.  You have to guess which ones have already been turned over. 
[02:44:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  Here's the guy saves his life, and then he fucking, just like a snake, turns around.  Well, the bitch fucking cracked a rifle over the guy's skull, so I don't think he was feeling  too good.  Yeah, but now they have to come back.  But when that guy's begging for his life...  Now they have to come back.  Kneecap him.  Boom!  There you go.  You're still alive, but you're going to be limping, motherfucker.  Enjoy that.  Well, you can't do that, because now the fucking guy really wants revenge.  Well, you can't, because they could...  He would sue you, first of all.  You would then probably get arrested. 
[02:45:00]  What, if you shot him in your house?  If you kneecapped him while he's sitting there begging for his life...  Oh, they say you already have him under control.  See, the deadly physical force is a very fluid situation, depending on what's happening.  If somebody is attacking you, you could use deadly physical force if you feel your life  is being threatened.  If that person is attacking you, you don't use deadly physical force, then he turns away  and stops attacking you.  You then cannot use deadly physical force.  If he turns back again, then you can. 
[02:45:30]  If he's begging for his life and then tried to kill you earlier, you can't fuck him up.  You got to kind of let him beg for his life and call the cops.  You can't kneecap him.  You can't fucking...  But can't you say you shot him before he started begging for his life?  You could say whatever the fuck you want.  Yeah, you shot him in the knee and then he fell and you said, you know what, fuck it,  I'm not going to kill him.  I shot him in the knee to slow him down.  You can say whatever you want, but if you watch a lot of these shows, and I'm not talking  about fake TV shows, I'm talking about real shit, cops know every fucking thing that happens  in a shooting. 
[02:46:00]  They look at splatter.  They look at where a guy was.  They question you.  They question the other people.  And eventually, they find out every fucking thing that happened.  They know if the guy was kneeling and begging for his life and you shot him in the kneecap,  they know he wasn't running.  They could tell by where the bullet is, where it ended up, splatter of blood, you're done.  So you just got to fucking sit there.  You could kick him right in the face.  I would do that.  I'd kick him in the fucking face and just leave him laying there and go, all right,  well, I'd have knocked the fucker out to get to my phone. 
[02:46:30]  I love the story until the end.  You don't let the guy go.  You hold him for the cops at that point.  You beat him up nice.  You bashed his head in nice.  You broke a rifle over him nice.  And then you let him leave.  And then the guy's shooting at you.  Then he says, we bashed him with a rifle outside the house.  Can't they get in trouble for that?  No, I think if she shot him, that would have been a problem.  I don't think technically she could be charged with deadly physical force for hitting him with a rifle.  If she wanted to kill him, she would have used a rifle maybe. 
[02:47:00]  I'm just saying also, she doesn't want this guy turning around and coming back.  That could be a perceived threat.  It's very weird.  You got to look at perceived threat more than actual threat because there have been people that have been completely innocent knocking on the door.  Someone opens the door and goes, ah, and shoots him and goes, well, I absolutely was in fear for my life.  And I thought this guy was going to do me harm.  And you get off.  The grand jury goes, all right, well, we thought it was going to fuck him up. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  Wow.  There's a guy who recently got fucking, got prison time.  And this is weird.  He was being mugged or carjacked or something was happening where there were a couple of guys on him.  Um, and he pulled out a knife and starts stabbing one guy.  So the guy runs away.  A guy actually came in to help this guy, but the guy didn't know it.  He thought he was another assailant.  Started chasing him and stabbed him in the back and killed him.  Shit.  The guy was just trying to help him.  Holy shit. 
[02:48:00]  That's not good.  He got nine years because he killed somebody.  But he honestly, you could honestly say like, wow, he probably did think it was one of the assailants.  But again, if they're running away from you, you're supposed to just let him run, leave him alone.  When you start shooting him in the back, you could have a problem.  Now there's a problem.  Now there's a problem.  I can see here.  Vince in Bayonne is back.  Next on Oprah, it's homespun.  It is idiocy with Rich Voss, author of Benedict Arnold and other historical figures. 
[02:48:30]  Benedict Arnold.  Benedict.  What's wrong, Rich?  Oh my God, what is that?  What's that?  Somebody sent me a picture of a girl having her period.  What the fuck?  That's great.  It looks like she was shot.  What is going on there?  What is that?  A movie set?  It kind of looks that way.  Wait, what's hanging?  Unfortunately, there's not a whole hell of a lot of detail.  Can you blow that up?  Yeah, what am I?  That's it. 
[02:49:00]  Let me try.  Yeah, I got to get a good look at that.  I want to see that bleeding fucking mess.  He's the king of the zoom in.  Whoa!  Okay, now I see what's going on.  Who is that?  I don't know.  She's doing a movie.  It looks like some kind of film equipment is going on behind her.  Get in on her face.  Wait, we knew that face.  She looks familiar.  Wait a minute, is that...  Who is that?  That might be Dakota Fanning.  That's right. 
[02:49:30]  Holy shit!  That might be Dakota Fanning.  Oh, so great.  She's growing up.  Oh my god.  That is the greatest picture ever taken.  Who's cleaning up?  Who's that lucky devil?  It looks like her.  I don't know if it is.  It does.  It does.  I would absolutely say you're right.  Holy shit.  Where did that picture come from?  She's getting quite leggy.  Oh my god.  She's fucking getting her period on the set. 
[02:50:00]  She's wearing a Partridge family skirt.  Being cleaned up by some fucking grip.  She's doing a period piece.  All right, Rich.  Birdie on the set.  Rich fucking Birdie.  Birdie!  Still got a couple double bogeys in there.  We're getting in the hole!  A couple double bogeys on the back nine, Rich.  And a snowman.  I don't have a snowman.  Fucking research.  You're going to research Dakota period?  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  Is that what you're going to put in?  Dakota period?  All right.  Dakota Fanning period.  Oh, God, Christ.  Oh, wow.  Well, what do we got here?  That's the cheerleader movie that's being made, huh?  I think that might be her growing up, right?  That kind of looks like it could be.  A little bit.  So many years go by, and then you're like, what the fuck happened?  She went and growed up.  That could be her, dude.  That is so hard. 
[02:51:00]  Come on.  Look at that shit.  What an embarrassing picture.  Oh, how embarrassing.  What's the difference between?  Rich, people want to know Tom Ladd from Chicago.  I'd bet a fucking thousand bucks on that right now.  Tom Ladd from Chicago writes, ask Voss what the name of the river is that Washington crossed.  The Delaware.  Delaware.  I remember he was crossing the Delaware, and he turned to his men and said, men roll faster. 
[02:51:30]  We only have the boat for one hour.  That was like a joke we learned when we were a little kid.  That was a joke.  Like a little kid.  Men wrote, what did Washington say?  She was crossing the Delaware.  That was a joke.  Delaware.  That picture is from the movie Runaways, and Jason from Jersey might have inside info.  He's saying the picture is bullshit.  Jason, Jersey, go.  Oh, is she supposed to be getting a period?  I just sent Danny a link on his Facebook there.  She's clearly got the blood on her fingertips of both hands, and she's making a face like, 
[02:52:00]  oh, God, not again.  Do you think if she really had her period, she'd be telling the girl next to her, oh,  look what I just did.  It's all over my leg and fingers.  Okay.  So you think it's for the movie itself?  It's for the movie.  That was a makeup guy or a prop guy applying the blood.  Yeah, he's applying the fake blood to the inside, because as embarrassing as it is,  she's not going to do it on a set full of 30 guys and go, oh, Jesus Christ, what if  this happened to me?  Thank you, Buzzkill.  It's still hot.  Buzzkill.  All right, Jason.  Thank you, Buzzkill. 
[02:52:30]  That's what gets you high?  That's great.  Hey, what's the difference between a home invasion and just breaking and entering?  Or, you know, if they're home, it's home invasion, or if they're not home, it's breaking  and entering.  Yeah, home invasion is breaking and entering, technically.  It's breaking and entering.  Yeah, but it seems like it should be more of a...  But it's also robbery.  You could have breaking and entering and burglary.  Without robbery.  Without robbery.  But, yeah, that's everything. 
[02:53:00]  Kidnapping, it's considered.  Assault.  Yeah, there's all kinds of other things that go along with it.  I think the B&E part is the least of their worries once there's people in the house  and you start pistol-whipping them.  In 76, 77, a guy I grew up with was a heroin addict.  He was doing it in 77, just kicking doors.  I mean, this was way...  Fucking trendsetter.  He was fucking way ahead of his time.  He was way ahead of his time with the home invasion.  I'm telling you, 77, he would kick the door.  He did, like, 30 years in Raleigh.  Let's do some more stuff.  Yeah.  You want to do something on the South Carolina governor? 
[02:53:30]  That was pretty fucked up.  Wait, he kind of disappeared for a little while?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  You know, that is just fantastic.  That is fanning-tastic.  She's just walking with blood dripping down her legs.  Why did she agree to this movie?  She did a rape movie when she was fucking 12.  She's quite the little actress.  What are you going to say?  Missing South Carolina governor was in Argentina with his mistress.  Argentina?  Went to Argentina with his mistress. 
[02:54:00]  It was three days.  That's Simple Mike.  Why is he Simple Mike?  He's just Simple Mike.  When the fuck did you get here?  He's been here...  What?  Microphone.  Three weeks ago?  This is Simple Mike.  You don't look familiar at all.  It's one of our new guys.  That's three weeks.  What have you been doing?  Doing feedback for Danny and doing drops.  But they say he's the...  Look, Danny's got an intern.  They say he's the dumbest one of the group.  But his body's too big for his young face. 
[02:54:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  He looks like an eight-year-old with an 18-year-old body.  You know what I mean?  That's very nice.  I wasn't really looking at him in that way.  He's got that little fucking...  Why Simple?  What's the problem?  They think I'm just very passive and not very confrontational and just sort of float along.  I don't know.  And dumb, I think.  You're like a serial killer now?  Yeah.  Did you go to college?  Yeah, I do.  Here comes Mike.  Mike?  Or Matt.  What is his fucking name?  I always forget his fucking name. 
[02:55:00]  Matt.  Matt, you're right.  Matt, come in here.  Look at him try to run.  Oh, my God.  As he's wolfing down a soda.  Someone is saying, why aren't you using this kid for Michael Moore videos?  Oh, I know.  You really should do some Michael Moore parodies.  Matt, why do they call him Simple Mike?  Because he can't do a task worth a damn.  Really?  Yeah.  Like what?  Every day we assign people to do things or just have people just do shit.  Could you breathe out until all the helium is gone?  How much did you make from the Evolution of Man poster? 
[02:55:30]  You did not do that joke.  I know.  It's an old one.  Take, you know, give me a bogey.  Wow.  Bogey?  Give me a bogey.  Snowman.  I'll give you a mulligan.  Let him do over.  So he can't do simple tasks?  Nope.  Like, give me an example.  Well, he's just stupid.  I'm sorry, but...  I resent that.  I don't think that's true.  Well, prove it.  Why is he looking good?  They look like Deronis.  I don't know.  I mean, why would I be stupid?  Every time we have a conversation, like me and Paul or somebody in the back have a conversation. 
[02:56:00]  We're going to have a rabbit.  You'll interject with some rant.  Birdie.  Birdie.  Birdie with a mulligan.  Sam's floating around the studio, which means he's got something on this too.  He tries to force himself into almost every conversation, and he just tries to make people think...  Maybe he's trying to get to know people.  Maybe he's just trying to get to know people, the atmosphere.  You just make an awkward comment, and then you just leave.  What is this, click? 
[02:56:30]  What are you...  Because you've been here earlier, it's very clicky?  Yeah, exactly.  And the new guy's like a replacement in the nom?  You don't want to get to know him?  No, it's not that.  Because he's going to take a bullet in the head?  No, some of the other interns have been very cool so far.  Yeah?  Are you the head intern?  No.  What's wrong with him?  This one?  Yeah, what's wrong?  I don't understand still.  I'll say the best quality about Nick is that he never talks, and I feel like that's not  a good quality, especially in radio.  I feel like...  No, the best quality about Nick is that he actually works, unlike any of the other...  I'm not working on him all day. 
[02:57:00]  No, you're not.  You don't work.  You're very...  All day, for five hours.  What have you been doing all day?  It's blatantly honest Sam Roberts is just coming to the room.  Wow, what's the problem, Sam?  What do you mean he doesn't work?  Simple Mike is simple Mike, because he has no work ethic.  He just sits there, and when you talk to him,  he just looks.  Like, you can tell he's not paying attention.  He makes no eye contact.  He's dumb.  Like, he's socially...  He's right there!  I know.  I've told him.  Holy shit.  He's fine.  Wait to hear what college he comes from, but we'll save that for a little later.  He's fine, I guess, with book smarts. 
[02:57:30]  I don't know.  You can't really test it.  He's just socially dumb.  Really?  Yeah, stupid.  No real skills as far as talking.  Nothing.  He's got no...  Here comes Iraq.  He doesn't know how to talk.  These guys can't wait to jump on the floor.  Wow.  He can't go with the vibe of a conversation.  Like, he doesn't know when to make a joke.  He doesn't know...  So, like, the guys are talking.  You'll be there, listening, like you said.  And will you try to, like, throw something in, and people just look like,  why are you fucking saying that?  Yeah, well, I just try to add to the conversation, and I think I do add, 
[02:58:00]  but I think they just resent me.  He's so unaware of everything.  Well, that's...  You've added nothing in your time here.  You just sit in front of that computer, idly just standing there.  Oh, you sound like a girlfriend now.  Yeah, cool.  Hey, Ralph, I have to have to shut up.  Yeah, so?  Yeah.  If you pay attention to Mike, he'll always reply with,  well, what I think is...  And he'll have an opinion of what he's doing or himself  that is completely opposite of everyone else. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, really?  Well, I think I'm doing a very good job, and nobody else does.  Mike, defend yourself.  Simple Mike.  You know, I think there's...  I don't even know how to defend myself.  I get this flack constantly.  We're from Connecticut.  New Jersey.  So, give yourself a little, yeah, give yourself a little pep talk.  Like, what are your good points?  People are bashing you that you just sit in front of a computer,  you don't do anything.  Give some, like, examples of what you do on a daily basis,  what you're good at, shit like that.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  I wouldn't go that far.  I mean, I think...  I don't know.  I think I'm a creative guy,  and I think I'm trying to figure out the pace of the show.  He doesn't...  He has a suggestion.  He did have a suggestion for a bit that he never did.  Oh, really?  So that could...  And what was it?  You could gauge his creativity.  All right.  Pitch the dog food.  Okay, yeah, I'll pitch it.  All right.  So, the plan was to make a fake radio spot for dog food ad  that sounds like dog food originally,  and then leads naturally and quickly into an ad for a company  trying to sell dog food in America from China, 
[02:59:30]  and then you take that to crazy people at dog parks,  and then you interview them about it.  Punch yourself in the face.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I thought that was all right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me let this sink in.  Right, yeah.  Before I just say, I don't even understand it.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  He also, like I say, he's dumb.  It's not...  I was trying to understand it, though.  You have this dog food commercial.  Right.  And it sounds like a dog food that a dog eats, 
[03:00:00]  but quickly turns into it's actually...  It's actually...  It's dog food.  Yes.  Oh.  Yes.  Genius.  Oh.  Right.  So, then you get, like, PETA people all around.  You know what you guys should do?  Oh.  Because people would think they'd hear it and say,  oh, my goodness, this is a real commercial,  not a radio gag.  They wouldn't think it's a bit.  You should have an intern pageant,  and they all have, like, have to show, like,  something creative.  They have to dress. 
[03:00:30]  Like, like, congeniality and a swimsuit.  Yeah, they have to all do...  But it would be, like, get a bit.  Come up with a bit.  Maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a little bit of a tease for probably next week.  Oh.  But Troy and I have come up with a task for all of them,  and we've been sending one intern out a day  onto the streets of New York City  and give them 24 hours to find the best  45 to 60 seconds of audio that they can.  Wow.  So we just have, like, two more guys left  that haven't gone out to do it. 
[03:01:00]  Have you gone out?  Yeah, I have.  All right.  I don't want to ruin it.  What?  Do you think it's good?  You like your audio?  I had a problem with the recorder,  and I sort of fell apart.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Well, I mean, I brought something to the table.  How did you have a problem with the recorder?  I brought something to the table.  It's a little alternative.  It's a little out there.  Well, I don't want an alternative out there.  What has this been happening?  I can't wait.  Outside of the box.  Outside of the box.  Outside, yeah.  That's good.  How did you not know how to work the tape recorder?  No, it wouldn't work.  I think it was low on batteries, and it would freeze. 
[03:01:30]  And I'd charge it for, like, three and a half hours,  and still no good.  Sam is wrinkling his nose and shaking his head no.  Like, nah.  Matt, is that true?  I had no problem with the recorder.  Everybody else who did it didn't have a problem  with the recorder.  Yet Simple Mike, who couldn't wind his watch  or scratch his ass.  Oh.  You know what it is?  He's either from real rich money  where he never had to do anything as a kid.  Sam's nodding us.  Or he's just completely stupid.  Like, he probably never had... 
[03:02:00]  Or both.  But he probably comes...  Where did you grow up in Jersey?  What town?  Morristown.  They got some cash up there.  Oh, yeah.  A ton of cash.  Not a ton.  It's certain areas.  Did you ever have a job?  Yes.  Yeah, I worked every summer for, like, last summer.  Cleaning the pool house for your dad?  Yeah, what did you do on the summer?  I interned the last two summers,  but before that, I was working in a restaurant.  Doing what?  Expediting and back waiting.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What does expediting mean?  When you work in a restaurant...  When I say I work in a restaurant...  Telling people it's closing. 
[03:02:30]  I'm fucking elbow deep  in other people's fucking food,  washing dishes.  We never call that expediting  when we're rubbing dishes.  Expediting?  What the fuck does that entail in a restaurant?  The waiter comes back with a ticket,  and I have to organize the ticket,  and then fire the food appropriately to the cooks.  Why can't the waiter go right to the chef?  Two crates, 20 people.  He found...  What exactly is it you do here?  He's the middle man.  Yeah.  I have people skills.  I'm a people person. 
[03:03:00]  He's the guy that takes the paper  and puts it up into the...  And makes sure it doesn't fall down.  Yeah, yeah.  I have to order the food.  I have to tell them what to cook,  so I'm sort of like,  control it a little bit.  Control it a little bit.  You ran in and went,  two cheeseburgers and fries.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  Two steak, medium rare.  Yeah, exactly.  E-Rock, you got something to add to this?  Well, I'm filling in for somebody  who doesn't want to comment on this,  but within his first couple of weeks here,  he made a comment that didn't fly well  with some of our security.  Oh, no. 
[03:03:30]  So...  Shut up.  I'm explaining it.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock.  Mike decides out of nowhere  to approach Club Soda Kenny  and goes,  so if I threw an egg at Opie,  you would have to tackle me or something, right?  And it didn't fly well with Kenny,  and Kenny asked that he be sent home.  Wow.  Well, he had already started...  Sort of a veiled thread.  It's like mentioning a bomb at an airport.  You don't even joke about things like that  at the airport  because it's taken seriously. 
[03:04:00]  So here,  any type of,  even a joke about assaulting the hosts  will probably get you, yeah,  thrown out.  Thrown out.  He had already started the jokes.  Like, he was joking around with Kenny,  and Kenny was...  I kind of like it, actually.  ...giving him nothing.  Yeah.  He's got balls.  Like, leave me alone,  and then he...  So did Spider.  Ask him what college he goes to.  Uh, Georgetown, D.C.  Wow.  You go to Georgetown?  You're the white guy that goes there?  Oh, damn.  Is that it?  Isn't that...  Oh, no, that's the other one. 
[03:04:30]  That's Howard, yeah.  That's Howard.  Jesus.  No, I missed up a college.  Yeah, you certainly did.  I never went.  Stupid rich talking a simple mic  in the morning.  What are you studying?  What do you want to be?  Uh, English.  I'm studying English major.  I want to go into film,  ideally.  You're like an alternative guy.  You probably like that type of comedy,  the alternative scene  down on the Lower East Side.  Who's your favorite comic?  Patton Oswald.  Actually,  Zach Ophanakis is...  He's very funny.  Yeah, I mean, 
[03:05:00]  that whole Comedians of Comedy thing,  have you seen that?  Ugh, he's funny.  Zach is very funny.  Yeah, yeah.  But the Comedians of Comedy,  please,  that thing was un-fucking-watchable.  Because Rich Watts wasn't in it.  Because they turned down  our pilot at the same time.  We both were selling pilots  and the same thing.  But Zach is very funny.  He's the guy in that movie Hangover.  Hangover, he's hilarious.  But he's fucking...  His stand-up is very funny, too.  I like him.  Have you made any short films or anything?  Yeah, I do.  Are they online?  Can we view them? 
[03:05:30]  I think I just have  some joke ones online  where you could look at them.  What do you mean joke?  All right, I like the way  you put that.  I like the way you prefaced it.  Like, I got a couple of joke ones.  Were they serious?  You didn't make these as a joke.  Well, no.  I mean, they're humorous.  They're comedy.  They're not serious.  All right, comedy.  I have two.  So what did you do?  Did you write, direct, act in?  Did you do everything?  Nothing?  What did you do?  Two, I probably act in.  All the production.  So editing, shooting, post-production.  So you did everything? 
[03:06:00]  Everything.  Who financed it?  Your family financed it?  No, I mean, it's just a digital camera  and a laptop in my high school.  I would absolutely like to see  one of your short films.  Yeah, which one do you want to show us?  Which one would you think would be good?  I might just probably go for the Britney Spears music video.  All right, Danny.  Pop it up.  The Britney Spears music video parody  as written, produced, and directed by Stupid Mike.  Or Simple Mike.  Simple Mike.  Excuse me.  Matt, are you jealous?  Matt, problem?  Of what? 
[03:06:30]  Of Simple Mike.  Simple Mike's getting some air time.  No.  He's on Danny's fucking computer right now  punching up some of his short films.  No, I...  The guy's been creative.  He's been doing shit.  What are you doing?  I've been writing promos  in the back consistently  for a couple of weeks.  Dropping gravy on his shirt.  Matt also does a wrestling podcast.  Oh, you do?  You do a wrestling podcast?  I do two podcasts  and two college radio shows.  Oh, really?  Excuse me.  Wow.  I'm not...  Oh, yes.  I'm here on Sirius Satellite.  I know. 
[03:07:00]  Do you want good alternative comedy?  Yeah.  Watch Todd Glass.  Watch Todd Glass.  Todd Glass.  Jesus.  I'm helping him out.  I'm helping the kid out.  Here we go.  You just wanted to...  Let's, um...  Oh, plug my friend?  No, it's deeper than that.  No, tell me.  What?  He's fucking...  He's a good...  I just want to show off your knowledge.  Oh, shit.  What are you talking about?  Do that off air.  Who gives a shit?  Well, because I already...  Oh, when he's trying to fucking compliment people.  Did you hear?  I've said your name.  Oh, no.  I wouldn't say that.  Big deal. 
[03:07:30]  I'm just giving...  There's not other entertainment that you like or say, hey, go see this, or that was great,  or this is funny.  Fucking love Bill Burr.  He's fucking great.  He's one of my favorites.  Out of all the comics I know, he's in my...  Out of all the comics that ever fill in for Jimmy, Bill Burr rules.  He's great.  He kills.  Number one.  He is definitely number one.  He really is.  Look at him for it.  I'm not...  Hey, listen, I...  Ring, ring.  I don't try to be number one.  Did you mean that earlier?  Well, you were kidding, weren't you?  Don't be a Benedict Arnold. 
[03:08:00]  I'm not sure if you were doing that for the radio or not.  By the way, Potomac asshole.  What are you talking about?  He crossed the Delaware, you idiot.  He crossed the Delaware.  I threw a coin across the Potomac.  No, I think you...  Oh.  Fucking Washington crossed the Delaware.  There's fucking pictures of it.  All right, what happened to the Potomac then?  There's pictures of it.  What happened to...  You had us, finally.  What happened at the Potomac?  You finally had us, and then you had to say there were pictures.  Yeah.  There's pictures of it.  There's no pictures of it.  Yeah, not...  There's paintings. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Paintings.  Famous paintings.  Paintings.  Famous pictures.  What's the difference?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Matt, do you think Rich is stupid?  Oh, hold on.  Bloated Titus is asking you a question.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't think Rich is stupid.  Well, then what's wrong with you?  You're fucking dumb.  Not just a young guy.  He's like big caps.  Well, I don't know George Town, so I don't know anything.  That's not true.  What happened at the Potomac?  Yeah.  A plane crash, yeah.  Well, that was years ago, but we want to go back a little further.  Let's look at Simple Mike's video. 
[03:09:00]  It's called Britney Spears music video.  It's just a remake here.  All right, let's take a look.  All right.  He's already overacting.  Can't be.  Wait, there's a boy in the girl's part?  Yeah, that's a joke.  That's crazy.  Who is that?  Is that you?  Yeah, in the front.  Are you gay?  No.  No, right?  He's playing the part of Britney.  Yeah.  But he's a boy.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  So you're lip syncing.  Just look at that track.  And doing the whole video.  Look at that tracking.  What do you think so far?  I miss David.  E-Rog, why are you holding your face like that? 
[03:10:00]  That's horrible.  Huh?  That's worse than Noah's Julia.  All right, we're out of here.  That's a stretch.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch- Julia.  Hit me, baby, one more time.  I'm looking at everything.  I'm taking everything into consideration.  The editing, the music, the lighting.  Yeah, that's one of my earlier works.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but this is the one you wanted us to sing.  Yeah, I mean, it's probably the most radio-  I mean, radio-friendly, I guess.  But I don't radio-friendly.  Satellite, you fool! 
[03:10:30]  This is fucking satellite.  We're playing a Britney Spears song now.  Huh?  That's all we're doing.  I mean, anything else would be hard to explain over here.  Yeah, I'm not really getting the-  Not even really dancing.  Any of it.  The theme.  This kind of goes on a while with you just lip-syncing to Britney Spears, so I don't really  get the-  Once the initial gag is done, it's like you don't have to go through the whole-  You know, maybe two-thirds of the way through this.  We could look at a more arthouse film.  All righty.  All right.  I'd be happy to do that. 
[03:11:00]  Wait a second.  Who's this girl?  Matt, are you a fan of the arthouse film?  Arthouse film?  No, not really, but I'll give anything a try.  You're more of the Pancake House film.  Also, to see him dig his hole deeper would make my day a lot more better.  What?  Waffle House.  Just to see him dig his hole.  Waffle House.  Thank you.  God damn it, Iraq.  Leave it to Iraq to know what I was talking about.  Well, look at him.  Of course he knows Waffles.  This guy's going to be a famous director or something.  Is that it?  Yeah, you can tell.  I don't know what it is.  I'm starting to like that.  He's mean.  I'm telling you.  This guy's going to end up on the skids.  He's going to end up on the skids and his parents are going to disown him. 
[03:11:30]  Maybe not, but he's going to be big.  Explain what we're about to see.  All right.  It is.  How long is this?  Is this like 40?  Yeah.  This is a minute 22 alternative piece.  I was actually in a film festival a couple of years ago.  Oh.  It was a short.  Matt, have you ever been in a film festival?  I've never wanted to be in film, so no.  Oh, well, don't piss on his fucking thing just because you never wanted to whatever.  Have you been in a wrestling podcast film festival?  I don't think there's such thing, Sam, but thank you for thinking of me.  Where can we hear your wrestling podcast? 
[03:12:00]  BrooklynBridgeMedia.com, Tuesdays, 7 to 9 p.m.  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  I'll have to remember to do my fucking webcast during that time and take all of your listeners.  Listener.  I'm teasing, of course.  Listener.  Well, I guess that's true.  Simple Mike.  This is called Bike.  Bike.  Yeah, and it's sort of a...  You want to set up the clip?  Yeah, it's sort of a destruction of innocence.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Yeah, no, it is.  Oh, God.  I hope that.  Yeah, right. 
[03:12:30]  What's the problem?  Oh, God.  Drek, right?  This isn't inside the actor's studio, you twist.  Oh, shit.  I'm predicting drek.  Yes.  I'm predicting overly produced, oversensitive drek.  No, it's art house.  I hope I'm disappointed.  Yeah, I mean, it's art house, so I don't know if Matt will be able to follow it or whatever.  Oh, excuse me.  Stupid Matt.  Matt, you knew that?  Nice.  That was a good one.  Just because I go to a community college doesn't make me a retard.  Oh, no, it does.  Oh, it does?  It does.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:13:00]  13th grade.  That's not true.  Yeah, I want him.  That dumb joke.  You're the 13th grade.  Works every time, though.  You know what I see here?  The resentment and anger from him getting the girls in high school.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  That might be it.  There's still some other issues.  Like, he had girls in that video that you probably were friends with and shit, right?  You went up and said, hey, could you help me out?  I'm doing this video.  And they're like, sure, sure, dummy, we'll do it.  And it was cool.  And those are the same girls that pointed at him. 
[03:13:30]  And laughed and, like I said, I would never fuck him if he was the last man on earth.  Right.  But in the long run, believe you me, you'll get yours.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  With a weapon.  Somehow, a hooker and a 55-callon drum.  All right, let's look at Bike, an art house piece.  And one more comment.  It was for a peace festival, so there's an anti-war message in text at the end of it.  Oh, great.  Boy, I'm going to fucking love this one.  At a peace festival.  You fucking lib college cunt. 
[03:14:00]  I know.  You're so brainwashed.  Good.  Let's see what this fucking dribble.  Let me out of your anti-war message.  Man, keep us out of the war, man.  Okay, there's a bike.  It's falling over.  It's black and white, of course.  Wait, the bike is riding itself.  It's now falling over at the beach.  It was falling over in the woods.  Right into the water.  Now it's falling over in a bush.  It hit a tire on a rope in the backyard.  It's black and white.  But no one's on the bike, Mike.  No one's on the bike. 
[03:14:30]  It's that sling blade music playing in the background.  How do you get the bike to do that, Mike?  Lots of takes.  Ghost ride the bike.  Must be ghost.  Ghost ride the bike.  It's ghost from Iraq.  All right, now the bike is representative of a more innocent time, like riding a bike  as a kid.  And now, right?  Am I right?  Of course I am.  Just shut up.  Oh, my God.  And now it's going through so...  Oh, no.  That's where TV's bike went.  Wow, that is some bike.  It was painted with thermite paint, the bicycle. 
[03:15:00]  Because now I'm seeing a mushroom cloud.  Mushroom clouds.  And now the bike is peeking out from behind a dumpster after it blew another tricycle.  The bike, the wheel is...  Cracked Rich Voss.  Peeking out.  Is that...  Oh, save the world.  Stop the bombs.  Save the innocent.  Bike.  Bike.  Finn.  Create a...  Finn.  Yes. 
[03:15:30]  Finn.  Wait, I don't get it.  Well, you can always tell that a film is successful in portraying its message when you need to  have text at the end explaining what it meant.  Matt, I understood that.  That was a requirement.  Well, let's go around the room.  Matt, what did that mean to you?  A waste of time.  The show.  A bike.  A bike.  I did see the bike representative of innocence.  Yeah, and the audio.  Then it was shut it.  Why wasn't anyone on the bike?  I'm teasing, of course. 
[03:16:00]  You could talk.  What am I?  Who the fuck am I?  I don't know.  This is what it meant to me.  Why wasn't anyone on the bike?  Well, Opie, what would it have done for you if someone was on the bike versus Opie?  Hey, Mr. Psychiatrist, Opie.  He's telling Opie.  I don't know what it means.  Yeah, well, I think it puts the viewer in a position to want to be on the bike, to want  to steer it, to want to be able to take care of it.  Have control of the bike before it hits the tire.  Yeah, you know, a bike's one of those things that you never see moving unless you're, you 
[03:16:30]  know, like an asshole third grader, like shoving it down the hill.  Did you ever think that maybe it wasn't that no one was on the bike?  Maybe everyone was on the bike.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  This is on YouTube as bike, by the way, if you want to check it out.  Just look up bike.  Just type in bike.  I like the one better when, um, actually, Pee Wee's looking for his.  That one is a scream.  Paging Mr. Herman.  It's an anti-war piece at the end of it, too. 
[03:17:00]  When he's, uh, you know, you want some fries, Dottie?  You know, that's an anti-war message.  The fries represent.  I see the bike.  Thank you, all dear friends.  For coming to my birthday.  I see the bike escaping the ghetto and going back to its.  Escaping, by the way.  Escaping.  Going back to its real owner.  Did you say bisketty?  Yeah.  Escaping?  I said escaping.  No, you said escaping.  Escaping.  Because I was talking ghetto. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, okay.  But how is that anti-war and.  Yeah, what was the anti-war message?  I understand the end of innocence kind of thing.  The thing was, it was an anti-war festival.  So we had to include, like, this text at the end of it.  That was sort of put in there.  But it's, like, with the music, it's more of, like, an emotional piece.  So they thought it fell in line with the rest of the thing.  Mike just wanted to make a movie about bikes falling down.  Yeah.  So then get it into a festival.  Anti-war festival.  How many tie-dye shirts and matted braided hair were at that festival?  Oh, how many fucking anti-war posters? 
[03:18:00]  They were playing hacky sack outside.  And, you know, frisbee.  They were throwing frisbee.  Frisbee.  All right.  Slow down.  What year is this?  We're missing the message.  Ricky M.  It's very obvious.  Oh, he's got it?  From Massachusetts.  No, guys, that's when Jesus was pushing the bikes.  You see, I only saw one set of tire tracks.  Right, no, right.  Jesus said, that's when you were in my basket.  That's right.  Jesus was.  That's when your foot got caught in my spokes.  Right.  And I drove you to the hospital. 
[03:18:30]  Bike pranks.  Yeah, you're right on Jesus' handlebars.  Oh, now we get it.  Oh, that's fucking great.  That makes sense now.  Okay.  All right, thank you.  Well, you are a college puke kind of a guy, but any other films?  That's it?  No.  Any long form?  You guys got to probably move on.  Oh, there's no moving on, my friend.  I mean...  You are firmly set in the barrel.  He meant to say moveon.org.  He was plugging that.  Yeah.  We could play the video I made yesterday of the interns. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, that came out pretty well.  Let's look at some of that.  The pep talk.  I was leaving work yesterday, and all of a sudden I see Sam, and he's got all the interns  around him in a huddle, and he's giving them a pep talk.  I try to provide inspiration for the interns, because I was there once.  That's good.  Right.  I hear you.  What kind of camera was that?  Sam, I just came across a really weird sight.  What are you doing here?  I'm giving these guys a pep talk.  I'm trying to get some people motivated.  A pep talk?  Why a pep talk?  Because these guys, like this guy's already got...  It's 10.30, 10.35 in the morning. 
[03:19:30]  He's already got backpack straps on.  He's rubbing his face because he's tired, as if none of us get up early.  Are you tired?  Yeah, it's exhausted.  Why are you so tired?  It's like three hours of sleep.  Why?  Because I take naps, and I shouldn't be doing that.  What time did you go to sleep?  I got home at noon, and then fell asleep at 3.  What, Paul?  He said he's been napping since he got here.  He's been napping.  They just throw each other under the bus.  Evan?  No, come right here.  No, it's unacceptable, really.  Because oftentimes I get zero sleep, and I still come in here. 
[03:20:00]  And oftentimes you have no show.  Wait, what are you saying?  He sometimes shows up at 6 o'clock in the morning, just like nothing happened.  That's incorrect.  It's happened more than once.  It's happened.  I just walked into a bad scene.  He really did.  This has been going on for weeks.  Why is it a bad scene, Paul?  Well, I'll throw you under the bus, fuck it.  Evan doesn't like to show up on time.  And the only time he's actually on time is when I pick him up to drive his stupid ass here. 
[03:20:30]  Wrong.  It's incorrect.  Okay, we had a bad two weeks.  We're not supposed to have a bad two weeks.  No one's allowed a bad two weeks.  Tell me about the time you said, what did you say?  You said, Sam, I'm going to start coming in five days a week.  Because when I was an intern, how many days a week did I come in?  Five days.  So what did you say?  I said I was going to come in five days that week.  And then the next day, what did you do?  I slept until 1030.  What do you have to say about this?  I wake up on time, and I get here the days I'm supposed to be here on, like, some people. 
[03:21:00]  But you look weird.  I don't care.  I do my job, though.  I may look like a homeless person, but I do my job.  Don't you think he needs more of an undershirt here?  Look how much chest he's showing.  I like showing my chest.  It's not right for a professional.  Oh, excuse me.  Oh.  Back to this kid.  What is he doing?  Nothing.  He doesn't do anything?  No, I haven't seen him do a goddamn thing.  You just throw people under the bus repeatedly.  Who's the dumbest intern here?  Mike.  Mike.  You Mike? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, I Mike.  And you're the dumbest one?  Why are you the dumbest one?  I don't know.  I mean, I have no idea.  They call me Simple Mike, so.  Simple Mike?  Yeah.  That might be your first clue.  I don't think I'm that dumb, but, you know.  What do I know?  What college do you go to?  Georgetown.  Georgetown?  You should be the smartest kid here.  That's what I'm excited.  I mean, I didn't say that.  I'm just laying low.  Yeah.  Simple Mike.  Simple Mike.  Are we done, Sam?  For now.  For this volume.  Not much of a pep talk.  Well, look at what I'm working with.  Do it like a Vince Lombardi right now for everybody.  All right, guys.  Motivated. 
[03:22:00]  Listen, guys.  You want to huddle or something?  Huddle in.  Everybody huddle in.  I've got a problem.  You are an instigating asshole.  Today's show is a disaster as far as you guys are concerned.  But the thing about shows is there's always another one.  Tomorrow we're going to all be in here at 4.30.  4.30.  And we're going to come in ready to intern for a radio show.  We're going to have hosts that are happy because they're fed.  Nobody's going to be thirsty.  Nobody's going to be wondering where's their pens.  Steve in the background.  The staff isn't going to be happy because they're fed.  You're all going to be searching for content.  You're all going to have new bits to bring to the show. 
[03:22:30]  None of them are going to fail.  You're going to have the bit.  And out of these men here, I'm going to get the next.  All right.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  O-N-A.  That's pretty pathetic, Sam.  That's why I said the next E-Rock.  I almost said the next Sam, but then I looked around and said no.  No.  Next E-Rock, maybe.  Because none of these guys are a mixed race. 
[03:23:00]  Well.  God damn.  I love that video.  That is a good one.  Where can people see that?  That's my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good one.  You see Steve in the background just scrolling, has no idea there's like 10 guys outside his office.  He never looks over.  My favorite part, which I'm so glad you reacted to it.  Sam's giving his pep talk, so I kind of pan the interns, and I noticed that one of the interns is a little light on top as far as hair goes.  Wow.  You zoomed right in on every follicle, every lack of follicle. 
[03:23:30]  That's Pierce.  Holy shit.  They took turns just throwing each other, smashing each other.  Oh, yeah.  Just like, didn't see like one light.  I came upon gold.  They were just.  They're all clawing over each other's bodies to get to the top.  Right.  Because if you remember.  Sam was one of those guys.  These guys are interns.  They were interns.  Yeah.  And now they run the fucking show.  Pretty much.  And the rest of these guys look around like, fuck, if they could do it, so can I. 
[03:24:00]  There is a reality here.  Like, these guys now, very important to the show, they actually do more bits for the show than you and I do.  I know.  And they started out as Simple Mike and Matt and the rest of them.  We're like fucking franchising it out.  This is like defending the caveman.  Like how they branch.  No, I didn't mean that one.  I meant blue man group.  You know what I'm saying.  No, I have no idea.  You can't get out of bombs by saying you know what I'm saying. 
[03:24:30]  Enough of that.  I need a coffee.  I understood the stupid bicycle movie more than I understood that last fucking joke.  I'm surprised that bicycle didn't have a rainbow decal on the bumper.  You know what I mean?  You know, for the festival.  For the Save the War festival or whatever.  Peace.  Back to back bogeys, man.  He's fucking up this back nine so bad.  I need coffee.  Yeah, is that it?  Iraq.  A little tired?  Before the show ended yesterday in what looked like a gang attack, apparently there's almost  a daily ritual that the interns force Mike to dance. 
[03:25:00]  Oh.  Well, he did dance in the Britney Spears video.  What are you talking?  Is it flip cam time?  Oh, wow.  It's just quarter.  I only do it a quarter of.  Yeah, but today we're doing it at eight after.  Yeah.  Oh, is it that?  Okay.  Yeah, I didn't get the memo, but.  I'm going up high.  Hold on.  Oh, please hold.  I mean, the dancing's not even that good.  I don't care.  Neither are the movies.  What the fuck?  Hold on.  Mars, I got to step on the board today to get over this.  Can I get some background music or?  Nah.  Background music. 
[03:25:30]  You didn't have any yesterday.  All right, hold on.  So what is this, Sam?  Well.  Just warming up.  Evan Swivelhip Seaman decided that.  It wasn't just him.  He should dance every 15, 15 after the hour, every hour.  Today we're switching it to eight after the hour, every hour.  So I don't know why, but.  Wait, so Sam, explain again.  Well, once every hour.  Yep.  This intern here, who's simple, has to dance for us.  Okay.  And that time is now. 
[03:26:00]  Well, Mike, you ready to go?  I mean, I'm not that good at it.  Just dancing here.  Just doing our best to get it going in here.  Just trying to get it going in here.  I'll do it with the skiing here.  Hit the slopes a little bit.  What do you call this dance?  I call it the eight after dance.  So Evan doesn't get mad at me.  That's not a good name.  Just do it.  Matt.  That's usually a, that's about it. 
[03:26:30]  Wow.  That was fucking terrible.  Wow.  I mean, you know, it's mandatory.  So you just do what you can.  You put your nose to the pavement and just get after it.  You had 24 hours to prep and I'm in.  Nose to the pavement?  That's not the expression at all.  Nose to the grindstone or you put your ear to the pavement.  Oh, is that ear to the pavement?  Foot to the pavement.  Foot to the pavement.  Your ear to the trail.  Ear to the streets.  Metaphors are awful.  Oh, why would you have your nose on the pavement?  You know what?  Did you fall?  Nose to the grindstone.  Yeah, I mean, the dance isn't even that good.  I'm not uploading that video. 
[03:27:00]  I wouldn't.  I would not.  That dance should be called, Now I Know Why People Don't Like Me.  All right.  Get it, Mike?  That was not a dance.  I was waiting for rain to come through the fucking...  Yeah, what were you doing?  It was almost like an Indian River dance.  Well, I don't know how to dance and I just have to do it.  But you did a Britney Spears dance.  Do you have any recommendations?  Can you help me?  Can I help you?  Yeah, give me some moves.  I always teach little rich kids how to dance.  I can't dance.  Oh, boy.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know where the rich kid's coming from. 
[03:27:30]  Why did they make you do it?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  He has to do something in between the time he gets here and the time he leaves at 11 o'clock.  Yeah, so I do it once an hour.  See, and they leave at 11 o'clock now.  All these interns leave right after you guys do.  What time did you guys used to stay when you were interns, Danny?  There were times where I was at the old XM office until fucking 4, 5 o'clock in the evening.  You were an intern, too?  Oh, yeah.  We would stay until people said, dude, you really can't be here anymore.  Yeah, yeah, you gotta leave.  Oh, the first crop of interns were fucking like the original Mercury astronauts. 
[03:28:00]  I stayed here so late.  That was amazing.  I remember I left one day because, and you know how late Eric stays here, nonsensically?  Yes.  One time I left because Eric actually fell asleep.  So I was like, well, I guess there's nothing else for me to do.  I'm going to go home.  That was just a story to throw Eric under the belt.  Eric fell asleep in a chair.  Don't some of these guys do this for just college credit or they want to, like, you didn't do it when you first came here. 
[03:28:30]  Was your motive to end up working here?  Yeah, Sam wanted in the whole time.  Yeah, but I mean.  Other guys do it for the credits.  Yeah, but you could, if you want credits, you could take a class.  Like, there's so many opportunities here.  You could do something.  Like, you don't have to get a job with this show.  You could do something here that would lead to something.  Like, he wants to do broadcast.  Right.  What do you want to do?  Media exposure.  That's all I want.  This is the biggest show there is.  Media exposure.  Yeah, I just want to learn.  I mean, I just want to learn about radio.  And I actually got yelled at yesterday because that was my reason. 
[03:29:00]  What have you learned so far?  Because everybody wants to go into radio and I just want to learn about radio.  Well, what have you learned during your internship so far?  You know, just daily tasks of how to, like, how to prep, how to figure everything out.  This is why Mike got yelled at.  Okay.  Because he said he wants to learn about radio.  And he was informed that if he wants to learn about radio, being in a building where there  are a hundred different radio stations and leaving at 1045 in the morning is a terrible  way of doing it.  Right.  Right.  Just take a tour somewhere.  Like, take a tour of the fucking radio museum. 
[03:29:30]  Jesus.  If I wanted to learn about something, I wouldn't get up every morning and be a slave to it.  I'd read a couple of things on the internet, pretend I know about it.  Wikipedia radio.  Jesus.  They get us egg sandwiches.  Well, we were in Philly.  We wanted to see the Liberty Bell.  We didn't even go.  So we looked it up online.  Drove past it.  We didn't go inside.  That's all you got to do.  We got a couple of bits of knowledge and go, we went to the Liberty Bell.  All right.  Let's get these guys out of here.  All right.  Great job, guys.  Let me tell you something. 
[03:30:00]  Now you know who Simple Mike is.  Now I know your name.  And I'm the worst.  Nice to meet you guys.  I'm the worst as far as knowing the intern's name.  I kind of like that movie, The Bike.  I thought it was pretty good.  I got your copy.  Slow down.  Jesus.  It's a bike.  No, I don't.  It was shot well.  I think it was kind of for a college kid to do something like that.  Not the fucking whole meaning.  It's not demeaning or anything.  I thought it was pretty good.  That's high school, by the way.  That was high school.  See, now that's why people don't like you. 
[03:30:30]  What were you doing in high school, Rich?  What was I doing in high school?  I was stealing a bike.  What is this?  Oh, yeah.  That's a narrative.  Huh?  Yeah.  It's another Mike production.  What the fuck am I doing in it?  Well, it looked like you.  Yeah, it looked like you, Matt.  Coca-Cola.  We could look at another one of Mike's films another day.  Yeah.  I'm going to look at all of them when I get home.  I actually have to go catch a train, so.  Oh, well, sorry.  Sam, he's leaving early today?  I know.  Are you being serious right now?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I'm serious.  Just don't come in.  Just don't come in. 
[03:31:00]  I've been here for six hours.  Wow.  A whole six-hour work thing.  Oh, jeez.  Just stop coming.  All right.  I'm just.  Wait, why?  Just don't come in.  Sam's firing interns right in front of us.  That's heartbreaking.  The guy's just.  Wait, Sam, what's the problem?  He's got somewhere to go.  Why do people come here?  I don't understand.  He's got a train to catch.  Let's find out why he has a train to catch.  To get home?  Where are you going?  I'm going to Metro Park, New Jersey,  where my mother is going to pick me up,  and then we're picking up my grandmother  from the airport.  Oh.  And then we have to drive to Pennsylvania. 
[03:31:30]  Why don't you get her to pick you up?  Fuck, is she mulling drugs?  She was going to pick me up at three,  but then my grandma got an earlier flight.  This was like three hours ago,  so now I have to go.  Why are you going to Pennsylvania?  My aunt.  He just says my aunt.  My aunt.  Pennsylvania, my aunt.  Well, to visit my aunt with my grandmother.  We're an association?  You got to fucking string together.  She's like kind of sick.  Make a sentence.  Sam gets really mad,  because Sam's got the passion.  He's got the bug.  I don't understand how we can get  all these people to come in here,  and none of them have any real desire to stay. 
[03:32:00]  But what I don't understand is how can you,  and maybe I'm wrong,  how can you yell at somebody  that's doing six free hours?  Hold on, Rich.  Hold on.  I can't.  Free.  No, Sam, run down the list of interns.  What do you mean?  I see a whole bunch of new guys running around here.  Right.  There's obviously this guy who we've met,  Simple Mike.  There's Noah and Pierce,  who are roommates.  Pierce is the one with the receding hairline.  Right.  They also don't have any,  they just have blank stares in their eyes.  They're not really looking around. 
[03:32:30]  They're not looking to do anything.  At 1045, it's the old,  so do you need anything else?  And then when they say,  why do you leave so early?  Well, we asked if you needed anything.  And then who else is there?  Oh, and Nick, who's actually good.  But he was the quiet one in the film we did yesterday.  Yeah, but that's because he doesn't.  See you later, Mike.  Leave on a high note.  He doesn't even have time for you to finish up, Sam. 
[03:33:00]  Of course.  Well, he doesn't retain any information anyways.  By the way, let me tell you something also.  To interns, airtime is fucking golden.  It's golden.  It's what I'm saying.  And you're like,  hey, I gotta go.  Like you're fucking Dean Martin on The Tonight Show.  I gotta go.  I'm catching a plane for the Sands.  You're a picture.  Picking up Sammy.  Yeah, me, Sammy, Frank.  We're all going out tonight.  Later, Johnny, Ed, Doc.  You know.  Look at him.  He's just gone. 
[03:33:30]  He's just fucking gone.  I love this kid.  I love him.  He goes nowhere.  He wanted media exposure.  And so he's being exposed on the biggest radio show there is.  He is the greatest intern we've ever had.  I love that kid.  You know what's sad?  That guy will be more successful than any one of them.  Absolutely.  And he knows that already.  Holy shit, is that funny.  But there's something else going on with Sam.  I gotta throw you under the bus a little bit.  Oh, my.  Uh-oh.  You just miss having playmates.  Oh. 
[03:34:00]  Thank you, Danny.  Dude, I've been waiting for somebody to call him out of that.  He's gotta latch on, you know?  And it's just, it's like,  he's got some kind of disconnect in his life,  like where there's somebody close to him  that was gone in his childhood  because he had to grasp onto Than,  and then Than left and he didn't know what to do  so he had to grasp onto David.  And now David's gone,  so he's gotta find a new playmate.  The last batch of interns, man,  was Sam's playthings, man.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  We didn't even bring this to the show.  Every day,  if I hung out a little longer than the show  and I would go down near our office,  Sam always had these guys doing the craziest shit.  Yeah.  What was the one with David?  We made David eat,  you made him eat the whole birthday cake or something.  And I'm like,  what does this mean?  Man, it's completely off the air.  Right.  This has nothing to do with the show anymore.  Nothing to do with the show.  Yeah, people would walk by and say,  so what are you recording this?  And every time I'd say, no.  Right.  I'd made David do immunity challenges every Friday.  I forgot to bring this to the show.  And none of this was on the air. 
[03:35:00]  One day he had,  they put him in a straight jacket or Sam.  Yeah, it's all Sam.  Sam put David in a straight jacket  and it gave him how many hours?  I made David stand in a box  wearing a straight jacket  and said he couldn't leave the box.  No recording, no video.  No.  This was only for your six satisfaction.  No one will ever see this stuff.  Oh, yes.  And I made him stay in there for two and a half hours.  Holy shit.  And David stayed all two and a half hours.  Sam is fucking brutal.  And then one day he,  there was a birthday cake for someone's birthday. 
[03:35:30]  And also I walked down the hall  and David's got the box of the birthday cake on his lap  and he's trying to eat the whole thing.  And I go, what are you doing, David?  He goes, well, Sam told me  I have four hours to eat the entire cake.  See, we got pictures of it.  Because he wanted to be here.  He wanted it.  If I told him to do something,  he'd be like, okay,  I don't know where this will take me,  but maybe somewhere.  And he just,  holy shit.  But this was never on the air.  This is like a snapshot.  You are a fucking asshole.  I love it.  It's training.  It could lead to something on the air 
[03:36:00]  or bring out a personality or something.  It's like a drill instructor.  Yeah.  Sometimes what they're doing  seems completely different  than get out there with your gun and shoot.  You're training them.  Exactly.  Sam lost all his little friends  and we get a whole new batch  and he was excited.  Like, okay,  what can I get done with these guys?  And they're all disappointing you.  There's no one fun question here.  They don't want anything to do with you.  That's sad.  I'm trying to develop Evan now.  Evan?  Evan has potential.  He's not here today, unfortunately, 
[03:36:30]  but just because he fails so much,  but not one ounce of self-esteem  skates away from him.  Yeah.  He's got the highest self-esteem  for somebody who fails so often.  Which one's Evan?  He's the one.  He's got swishy hips.  Yeah, he's swivel hips.  But yeah, I mean,  none of them are like fun.  Yeah, you're bummed out about that.  There's nothing to do with it.  Do you hang out with any of them  after the show?  He wants to, but none of those guys  want to play.  They're all dull and boring.  David, I'd always make David 
[03:37:00]  walk me to wherever I'm going  after the show.  By the way,  that video that we played  that I filmed after the show yesterday,  we just set that up for the show?  No, no, no.  I just came upon that.  That would have never made it fair.  It was happening.  It was just Sam gathering the interns  and playing with them.  Yes.  They're his play toys.  You're like a Star Trek alien.  They're calling you...  Just use humans as your play toys.  It's like Twilight.  You remember Twilight Zone  when they were lost?  They were in some kid's  little play area.  Did you see that Twilight Zone? 
[03:37:30]  With the dolls.  Yeah.  And he kept being on the train  that went nowhere.  Oh, that thing, yes.  And then you see a big shadow down  and goes playing with them.  Yeah.  Wes, the trucker's saying  Sam's a cult leader.  Uh-oh.  Guess what?  Mike's film was ripped off.  Of course it was.  He sucks.  It's unoriginal.  Let's go, Rich.  Plagiarism?  Rich in Louisiana.  Rich.  Hi, my boys.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, uh, Mike's anti-war video  is a direct rip-off  of a campaign commercial  by Lyndon Baines Juntz 
[03:38:00]  in 1964  with the little girl  counting the flower petals  and the nuclear bomb going off.  Nah, I've seen that one.  That's a little...  Nah, it's a little bit of a stretch.  Yeah.  I've seen that one.  That's a...  It's just a girl picking flowers  and then an atom bomb goes off.  But there's an innocence thing there.  There's plenty of atom bomb things.  Yeah.  Look at what Voss has been  laying out all day.  No, that's not true.  Okay, not all day.  I'll give you a couple.  What are you going to give yourself today?  Yeah, what are you giving yourself?  Uh, 18 holes.  Par 72.  We're right down.  Par 72. 
[03:38:30]  14 handicaps.  So what are you giving yourself today?  Uh, 8.  Someone didn't understand  what a snowman means.  That's an 8.  An 8.  8.  Obviously.  Today, what I shot today  would be about an 84, 85.  Should have been yourself.  84, 85.  I mean, I didn't...  It wasn't...  No, it was a good round.  So it was an 82.  82.  Not bad.  82?  Really?  Yeah, not bad.  What did you get on the front?  On the front?  I gave it 36 on the front.  No, I didn't shoot par.  I shot 38 on the front. 
[03:39:00]  Uh-huh.  82.  44 on the back.  What the fuck is this?  That's another one of Mike's movies.  But it's just like the other one.  This one's called Scott the Robot.  But it looks just like the other one.  Dude, he loves this.  He's no fun.  Sam's depressed.  I love this.  He sucks.  Like, I love this place.  What are you going to have the interns do today?  Huh.  Do you have any play dates set up for later?  After the show?  Play dates.  I don't know.  I mean, obviously one person will have to go. 
[03:39:30]  Because I like to bring everyone together  and point out flaws so that they can build on them.  And what does Steve do?  Isn't this Steve's job?  No, Steve watches...  I don't even have seen them today.  He watches Ghost Rider trailers all day.  Really?  So that's probably why he wasn't looking away  from the computer in the video.  Because he was watching a trailer for a Superman movie.  The video's like three and a half minutes.  There's all sorts of commotion going on.  Yeah.  They're throwing each other under the bus.  And Steve's in the background.  He didn't move once to see what was going on  outside his own office.  Superhero movie trailers. 
[03:40:00]  We can't profit from it.  Sam thinks...  That's what he watches?  Sam thinks it's Pledge Week.  Are these your new pledges?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yes.  People can get hazed a little bit.  It's not harmful.  You're like fucking Niedermeyer in Animal House.  Matt's still around.  Are you ready?  Matt, you want to play with Sam today?  I'll play along with Sam.  All right.  What can you do with Matt today?  I don't know, Matt.  I've already told all the new interns  that Matt's my favorite  because I make him bring me wrestling tapes every week. 
[03:40:30]  You have enough wrestling tapes.  Yeah, but I don't have all...  He has some that I would like to...  Holy shit.  So you're using him...  I'm essentially a drug mule.  You're a user.  No.  Sam's a user.  Matt may have conversations, you know.  Yeah?  Matt, what kind of conversations do you have with Sam?  Show and wrestling oriented mainly.  Like he'll be like,  do you have enough space on your thumb drive  for me to put these wrestling tapes on?  Or, you know, conversations like that.  Yeah.  He uses his power. 
[03:41:00]  He means something to me at least.  Do you archive your web podcast?  Yes, I do.  All right.  As a matter of fact,  I listened to his podcast  and gave him constructive feedback  that was not all negative.  Feedback.  Feedback.  Could you email me the address of his podcast?  Because I would like to give one a listen.  Okay.  All righty.  Just did a show on Tuesday.  He's not bad on the air.  That'd be...  I'll listen to one of the newer ones.  There's something about him.  There's something about Matt.  What's that?  He's creative, this kid. 
[03:41:30]  There's something about him.  You could tell.  Like he...  Like the other kid's gonna make it as...  Just because he has got cash.  He could be in school.  He could...  He reminds me of everything that's wrong in Hollywood.  And he reminds me of what Hollywood should be.  You know what I mean?  He's like the...  You're the judge how?  I know,  because I've never really been to Hollywood.  How do I even know?  Exactly.  Hey, Sam,  are you saying that none of these interns  are capable of making a big...  Big Boy Makes a Duty film? 
[03:42:00]  I don't see a Cream Pie Jones in this pack.  Not a one, right?  Not Cream Pie.  We were lucky with David.  Cream Pie.  He would have done anything.  I know.  That motherfucker picked shit up out of a toilet bowl.  That's right.  Matt, are you willing to do that?  And then wave goodbye to it.  Where's your shit video, my friend?  Really?  Not...  I haven't done a shit video yet.  Yeah.  As far as I'm concerned,  there have been two interns.  Cream Pie Jones and David.  That's it.  And intern David.  That's it.  All the other ones are dead.  Yeah.  They don't even exist.  Most of them I don't even remember. 
[03:42:30]  Why would you?  I don't remember anymore.  Why would you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  You know?  They're no fun.  No, these are fuddy-duddies.  These seem like fuddy-duddies.  They don't have, like, a passion.  They don't want to get in there  and be like,  okay, whatever you say,  yeah, let's do it.  We're in radio.  I get to hang out with  the Opie and Anthony show.  They're just like,  yeah, can I go now?  We don't.  Yeah, I gotta go.  I gotta catch a train.  I gotta catch a train.  I'm on the air and everything,  but I gotta get out of here.  You guys done with me?  A moment like this 
[03:43:00]  to actually be on the air  is like, what?  He just got 20 minutes.  Yeah.  And then left.  I know.  So then he waved  and fucking just left.  When I was an intern,  I was going home  and taking the 30 seconds  of me on the air  saying,  who got this coffee?  Sam?  Yeah, it was me.  It sucked.  And the yeah, it was me.  Oh, I was on the show  and getting this little clip.  I have clips of me  when I was just a brand new  and I was like,  look at this.  I'm on the show.  Meanwhile, he left  like a publicist  was dragging him out of here.  Yeah, it was a fucking guy. 
[03:43:30]  He left like a publicist.  Yeah, like a publicist.  Get him out.  They don't know the power, man.  No, they take it for granted.  Got instant feedback.  I don't think it's  the real Kevin Smith,  but if it is,  that'd be good.  He writes,  new bit,  hell week with Sergeant Sam.  Yeah.  They should have a hell week.  Yeah, they should probably  have to go through  something like that,  like the Navy SEALs go through.  Yeah.  Basic trainings  for just an ordinary intern,  but we need interns  that are like Navy SEALs.  Look, this isn't just...  Or like Airborne 
[03:44:00]  or Rangers or something.  What else did you have  intern David do?  Oh, I mean,  I don't even remember.  David, I used to make  intern David  walk with me  to Grand Central Station  to whatever parking lot  I was parked at,  even though it was  far out of his way.  Like, he would literally  have to double back  eight blocks.  You're such a prick, man.  I go, no,  David, we're walking this way.  Come on, David,  we're walking.  Okay, okay.  Okay, I'll walk with you.  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  Okay.  Sam, I remember you telling me  that you told David 
[03:44:30]  to go take the S train  from Grand Central.  Grand Central to Times Square  just because it's fun.  No, stop it.  Yeah, that's right.  We were in...  Where does the S train go?  I don't know.  Well, the S train runs  from Times Square  to Grand Central  back and forth.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus, man.  Thank God you're Jewish.  That was an eagle.  Hey, Pat Duffy,  let's not forget Pat Duffy.  An eagle standing on top  of a circle  with a symbol in it.  I know, but still,  he was an amazing intern.  I know you guys  didn't get along,  but when you talk interns,  you gotta mention 
[03:45:00]  the Duff.  So what happened  with the S train ride?  Yeah, I was in Times Square  at the train.  Well, I saw David  at the 57th Street  subway station  and we were both  going to Times Square  for the connection,  you know, the train.  And I was like,  David, jump on the S train  with me.  Have you ever taken  the S train?  And David was like,  no, why would I take  the S train?  I don't need to go  to Grand Central.  And I was like,  no, just go to Grand Central  and right back.  It's awesome.  Come on.  It's fun.  You've never done it,  David.  You need experiences  that you haven't had before.  Well, yeah. 
[03:45:30]  And so I actually,  he did actually  get on the S train  with me  and then it arrived  at Grand Central  and there was one person  that stayed on the train  to get the ride  straight back  to Times Square.  And that was David.  That was David.  You have to wait.  Holy shit.  Don't go right back.  It's terribly inconvenient.  Right, it's awful.  Apparently the interns  went out drinking  on Friday  when David was here.  And I've been getting  pictures from all of them  progressively throughout  the week of David  who got plastered  and then they walked him  around Times Square 
[03:46:00]  where David was asking  people to take pictures  with him  and every time  he got a girl  to get next to him  he tried to make out  with her.  And this is like  the lady trying to get  people to go to Chicago  the musical.  Like people trying  to hand out like  tickets or whatever.  Like come see this musical.  David would say  oh we need a picture  we need a picture.  And they'd get together  and then David would  turn around  and try to kiss her.  That's great.  That's like rape.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  Fucking guy.  Alright.  What a collection.  We lost Matt  because Rich Voss  needed coffee.  We were talking to Matt.  But see this is what I'm saying.  Voss says on the air  I need a coffee.  There's two interns  in here and four outside.  And none of the four  outside even got  off their seat.  So we have to send  the one who's in the studio  to go get it.  Who's actually doing  like on air shit.  Yes.  You want to bring  the other interns  in real fast?  Yes.  Oh man he's mad.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  He's fucking great.  I didn't know  he was like this.  I know.  That's what it is.  He's fucking great.  Doesn't he come across  as like an innocent  nice kid.  And he's a fucking  prick.  It's fucking Mengele.  He's a prick.  Oh here they are.  Alright.  I just like calling him  Jay Moore.  You like that kid  I thought.  Nah.  No.  I'm in front of him.  No.  Jay Moore has terrible  videos on YouTube also.  Are you two related?  Oh really?  Oh yeah.  Alright.  What's up with these two  Sam?  Well.  And who are we looking at?  Intern Jay Moore. 
[03:47:30]  Not that.  Not the actual Jay Moore.  I assume.  This is Noah and Pierce.  Another Noah.  How many fucking Noahs  have we had?  Who's Noah?  Which one's Noah?  We're working on our  fourth Noah.  Are you a Jew?  How you named Noah  and you're not a Jew?  How the fuck did  I haven't come across  one Noah in my life  but four at work.  And Pierce you may  remember his hairline  from your video.  Jesus Christ man.  I remember his hairline  from Phil Collins videos.  What do you get these 
[03:48:00]  people from  misshapenhead.com  or something?  Alright now you.  Pierce.  Hey.  You gotta stop  your head Pierce.  What do you  aspire to do?  You can hold it.  Yeah you can pick  that mic up.  Hey look at this guy  just strolls in.  Yeah what do you  like want to do?  Internship wise here?  Yeah well like  after this internship  like what's your goal?  I would like to work  somewhere with audio.  With audio?  Yeah.  So whether it's in 
[03:48:30]  the motion picture industry  or radio  somewhere in between?  Yeah somewhere  in the record store.  So that's when you  I would like to  talk.  Wait Ant  so alright  he seems like  a normal kid  what's the problem  Sam?  Yeah awesome.  So what have we  been talking about  He's a kid?  You got that  fucking Pajerio disease?  Pajerios.  I love that cereal.  Immediately write that  up on one.  I want a bowl of  Pajerios.  That cannot be 
[03:49:00]  forgotten.  Tomorrow bowl of  Pajerios please.  Pajerios.  Holy fucking retard.  Pajerios.  Rich Voss is  a fucking retard.  I love it.  What is a Pajerios?  You know he's got  that fucking thing.  That Pajerio disease.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Whatever that word is  you know what I'm saying.  Alright Sam  what's the problem  with this kid?  He seems motivated  once again the audio thing.  Yeah he seems motivated.  So why is it that 
[03:49:30]  when Rich Voss  asks for a cup of coffee  on the air  he remains thirsty?  Not sure.  See?  Do you see?  That's the answer.  I think it's disrespect.  That's not quite an answer  that you would look for.  Look who's come running  down the hallway  with my coffee.  I like this.  Oh I know.  Look at this.  Do you need that now?  No don't worry about it.  It was 15 minutes ago.  Thank you.  Alright let's move on  to Noah.  Thank you.  So we're running  out of show here.  So we got I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And now Noah  what do you want to do 
[03:50:00]  with this whole thing?  I think I'm in the same boat  as Pierce.  I'm not really sure yet.  Yeah that sinking ship  the Titanic.  So you want to do  some kind of audio?  Yeah hopefully I'll know  by the end of this  a little more.  Yeah you probably won't.  Now Sam problem?  Yeah sure.  You were sitting  outside the studio.  How come when Rich Voss  asked for a cup of coffee  on the air  he remained coffee-less?  I don't know.  I think we need to  turn up the  They couldn't hear  the show.  Who's the monitors? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  Who's we?  The speaker things.  Are we allowed to have  the monitors on  outside the studio?  They've been on yeah.  Okay.  Who's we?  Me.  Oh.  I take full blame.  He did start with  an I don't know  also though.  I know he did.  He goes I don't know.  Yeah but that makes  Sam happy that he  like took a little blame.  He should be taking  because  what have we been  talking about on the show  just now  before you guys  came in?  That's my favorite  question then.  I know Mike was in here.  Right.  Because you saw him.  Yeah.  But you didn't hear him. 
[03:51:00]  No.  No.  Have you asked the interns  what happened on the show  today they never know.  It's like a game show.  They think it's a soundproof booth  and then they're all  brought in separately.  Look at their shoes.  It's just  we got to help him out.  Wow.  Look at this fucking mess.  Holy shit.  What the fuck.  You got huge feet.  What the fuck.  Like steal those.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  They look like  those can't be real.  They look like the  ark that his name is.  That is giant.  You have two of every  animal in there.  Look at those fucking things. 
[03:51:30]  What size shoe do you wear?  13 and a half.  And you don't.  But you're not that tall.  They smell horrible.  No.  Really?  We can smell.  Holy shit.  You're talking about  the different shoes.  Smell the shoes.  Smell the shoes.  It was not the shoes.  Iraq will smell your shoes.  This guy's got shoes  from the fucking  homeless shelter.  This guy's got diamond earrings  and true religion jeans.  Who?  Fucking character  from Grand Theft Auto?  Yeah.  This guy  that robbed the warehouse  last night  before he came here.  The second story man.  Okay. 
[03:52:00]  This is a lineup.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I know.  What's with the shoe?  Smell it.  Two feet away  you can smell it.  Smell it.  Oh, dude.  What does it smell like?  That's the second pair.  He has another pair.  Because it's leather.  Yeah, leather.  I've got some ears.  Leather doesn't bring it.  And you don't tie them  or anything, huh?  No, they look weird  when you tie them.  They look weird  when you tie them?  What, do they turn  into a balloon animal?  Because they can't  look much weirder.  Those are weird  looking shoes.  I got breaking news. 
[03:52:30]  Yes.  For real.  From Mike,  also known as Simple Mike,  to Steve  at foundrymusic.com,  I, Mike,  hereby resign my internship.  I can't take this shit anymore.  Fuck it.  No way.  Best Mike.  Is that true?  It's either true  or somehow,  I mean,  the only possible  other reason would be  that he left his  email open  and I don't see  anybody would...  You've tendered 
[03:53:00]  his resignation.  If somebody were  on Danny's computer,  they would shortly  shut their email  before leaving the studio.  You'd have to be stupid.  Simple.  Or simple.  Wow, brilliant.  All right, well,  we got that,  that, that.  Yeah, what do you want  to do with your life  there, sir?  Stay out of jail.  I'd like to be  somewhere you're sitting.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  In the big seat. 
[03:53:30]  Competition.  In the big seat.  Hey, nice.  I don't want to rip you guys off.  I've been a fan  of you guys for a long time.  So if I did  have orchestrated a show,  it would be somewhat like yours.  Well, that big pussy show  got canceled.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, get in there.  All right, well, that's good.  That's something to do with.  Sam, they seem like  a good crew.  They're not a good crew.  They didn't do anything.  A good crew.  Why did Rich Vance  have to wait that long  for coffee  when we have this many people  here?  Because he was listening  to the voices  in his head at the time.  He didn't hear  what was going on.  No excuse. 
[03:54:00]  He doesn't give a fuck.  This guy was scared  that his ankle bracelet  was going to go off.  Okay?  I was actually doing the phone.  Shut up, I'm talking.  Wow.  Well, I guess we got  to get the fuck out of here.  $350 jeans.  RichVance.com.  Oh, yeah.  How's he afford jeans  like that, right?  That's what you're getting at, Rich.  I bartend at the surf club  in New Jersey.  Oh.  You're pointing to me  like I fucking freak out.  I know you're from Jersey.  The surf club. 
[03:54:30]  What is that?  If you want to see Rich Vance,  RichVance.com.  He's got dates all over the place.  Yeah, but definitely go to Scottsdale.  Scottsdale is the big one  you want to definitely push?  August 1st, Mardi Gras.  Bar and Grill, Scottsdale, Arizona.  RichVance.com for the other dates  before that one,  which will be on August 1st, right?  Right.  Sam, thank you.  Yes, of course.  Sam, always a pleasure  to have you in here.  Pleasure for me.  Discipline. 
[03:55:00]  You're like a fucking old sea captain.  Norton will be back tomorrow.  He might be on Red Eye, what?  Tonight, if he gets back in time  from wherever he was.  Hopefully he'll fill us in tomorrow.  All right. </pre>
