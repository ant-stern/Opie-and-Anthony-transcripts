<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, along with studio guest Steve, engaging in self-deprecating and vulgar insults directed at themselves.  They then discuss Opie's brother's recent birth of a nine-pound baby girl, two and a half weeks early, juxtaposing this joyous event with the anniversary of Opie's father's death, leading to a discussion on the absurdities of life and the pressures of parenthood, specifically the desire for both sons and daughters. A caller shares his experience of having six daughters.  Anthony expresses his reluctance to have children due to his selfishness, sparking a debate on the impact of parenthood on a comedian's career. The conversation turns darkly comedic, focusing on finding humor in children's misfortunes (excluding their own), and promotes various new videos on opieandanthony.com.  They also discuss YouTube videos featuring past Opie and Anthony moments.

The show shifts to a critique of American Idol auditions in New York City, playing audio clips of terrible singers.  This transitions into a critique of a local news reporter's lack of improvisation.  A call-in segment follows.  Later, the hosts discuss the Israeli-Hezbollah ceasefire, Boy George's community service, Jim Norton's upcoming Hammerstein Ballroom show, their upcoming vacation, and their plan to repeat a failed stunt involving women in lingerie crawling amongst mousetraps for $2,500 (a significant increase from the previous attempt). The show ends with more vulgar and humorous banter.

A separate segment begins with a discussion about a shirt given to comedian Rich Vos (who wasn't in studio).  The hosts jokingly criticize actors who become overly involved in their post-filming activism.  They then discuss the totaled van belonging to Opie's brother, urging listeners to buy merchandise from myradiostore.com to help cover costs.  A substantial portion focuses on speculation about Fidel Castro's health and potential death, based on a recently released photo.

A caller, Matt, describes a bar fight at a Rich Vos show in Kansas City involving hecklers, including an ex-con, the club owner, and Rich Vos himself. Rich Vos then calls in to recount the incident.  The discussion then shifts to airport security and racial profiling post-9/11, with callers sharing their experiences, including a Palestinian Muslim caller, Mike, voicing his frustrations.  A lengthy discussion about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict follows.  The segment concludes with a brief mention of Boy George's community service and a quick update on a previous caller, Lady Di, who was previously described as homeless and struggling with alcoholism.

Another segment starts with dismissive comments about the previously mentioned Lady Di, followed by a caller, Brandon, recounting a bizarre wedding encounter next to a "midget convention."  The conversation returns to a highly offensive and aggressive grilling of Lady Di about her homelessness, alcoholism, and relationship with her son, with other callers contributing negative information about her life and deceased husband.  The show then discusses newspaper headlines (including a murder-suicide and a pit bull attack) and a news story criticizing the show's lack of local focus.  More caller interactions follow, discussing topics such as a listener placing stickers on buses, an altercation outside the studio, and observations about passersby.  Edward Norton, initially scheduled as a guest, does not appear.  The segment ends with a discussion about a rival radio show, Lamont and Tonelli, accusing them of stealing their material, followed by a promotional announcement for their "Traveling Virus" comedy tour.

A significant portion of the broadcast is dedicated to a scathing, highly offensive attack on Lamont and Tonelli of "107.7 The Bone," fueled by a caller nicknamed "Godzilla."  The hosts unleash a protracted rant filled with homophobic, racist, and misogynistic slurs, accusing Lamont and Tonelli of plagiarism, cowardice, and hypocrisy.  They dissect Lamont and Tonelli's show, mocking their personalities, stunts (including a “human CD holder” competition), and promotional material.  Listeners are encouraged to bombard Lamont and Tonelli's MySpace page with offensive content and prank call them.  The rant is interspersed with a Bill Burr stand-up routine about infamous names, listener-submitted items (including pictures from Lamont and Tonelli's website), a prank call to Lamont and Tonelli's show, discussion of an upcoming Opie and Anthony softball game, and promotion of their website.

Another segment begins with a caller, Glenn, saying goodbye before army training at Fort Gordon, Georgia.  The conversation then shifts to pictures from a karaoke night featuring Anthony's sister, described in highly sexualized terms, and includes childhood anecdotes about her, including one involving feces.  Lady Di calls in again, initially denying, then admitting to being intoxicated, leading to another prolonged, extremely hostile, and vulgar confrontation about her alcoholism and neglect of her son.  Further callers, Christian, Keith, and Tom, contribute to the heated exchange about alcoholism. The hosts attempt to contact Lady Di's son.  The show then discusses an 89-year-old woman fighting off an attacker using highly violent language.  A clip from *Good Day New York* featuring Mike Wood impersonating American Idol judges is played, followed by negative comments from the hosts.  The segment ends with more discussion, banter, and a final, abrupt exchange with Lady Di.

The final segment includes a song with extremely offensive and sexually degrading lyrics using the word "cunt" repeatedly.  Following the song, the hosts advertise the "O&A Party Rock," a novelty item described in an absurd and nonsensical manner. No guests were present for this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of talent on PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[00:01:00]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  You can act like a man.  Ah. 
[00:01:30]  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had.  And I've had him all over the world.  Ah.  Love waltz.  I could not.  How could you not?  Time to run through this crap one more time.  A big shout out to KR DJ and Baton Rouge.  Oh, red stick.  Talking about Baton Rouge today?  Yes.  Baton Rouge. 
[00:02:00]  Big day for Baton Rouge.  What about Albuquerque, New Mexico?  Albuquerque stinks.  Yeah, you're right.  No.  We embrace you.  We embrace Albuquerque.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hope you had a great weekend.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Free man.  And congratulations to my brother, Quinn. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  He had a little baby Saturday.  He did.  He wasn't supposed to have the baby until the end of the month.  Oh.  But his wife decided to go early.  Decided.  I guess.  I don't know.  Water broke.  How do those things happen?  All of a sudden, it's just like, oh, that's got to be frightening.  I don't know.  What power to him?  How many does that make?  Second daughter. 
[00:03:00]  Second.  Reese.  Daughter.  Reese.  Reese Hughes.  Looking for a son?  They're going to keep going at it?  That's what I was discussing with Lindsey on the way home from the hospital last night.  I'm like, he's got to go for a third now.  Oh, boy.  And I'm wondering how many people out there wanted to stop making babies, but they didn't  get the son or they didn't get the daughter.  Yeah.  So they had to keep trying.  Well, that's what happens.  And all of a sudden, you only wanted two kids and you got like five girls.  And you're like, oh, I got to try one more time.  Then some of them stop.  You know, they're gravely disappointed. 
[00:03:30]  I'm thinking.  And then they have to deal with five daughters.  But yeah, most of them don't stop until it's.  Yeah.  Until they maybe get up to the five daughter.  Then after five daughters, you're like, look, we just got to face the fact.  I can't have a son.  I got to deal with now five daughters where, you know, at least one of them is going to  be a slut.  And you're going to have to deal with the guys coming over the house.  Oh, the horror.  I got to tell you that life is really silly. 
[00:04:00]  Silly.  Yeah.  If you give me a moment here, life is really silly.  Friday through Sunday.  Just horrific for me personally.  Horrific.  Okay.  Yeah.  Not to like make everyone sad.  But two years ago, my dad was in a horrific car accident on the 11th and he died on the  13th.  Okay.  So for three days, it was just like, it was just like, we knew what was going to happen.  We were just waiting.  Nothing better than anniversaries of such fun things like that.  Oh yeah.  It's just terrific every year to look forward to that. 
[00:04:30]  So, uh, but this is where life is just silly.  My, my, my brother's, uh, wife wasn't supposed to have the kid until the end of the month.  Yeah.  So we're in the middle of this horrific weekend starting on Friday and then Sunday is the death  day anniversary, right?  Wonderful.  And right in the middle, she has a freaking kid to like, lighten everyone's, uh, spirits  there.  Aww.  I'm right on the 12th.  12th doesn't mean anything.  11th means something.  The 13th means something.  Yeah.  It's, uh, death and doom. 
[00:05:00]  And now on the 12th is this, uh, is this breath of sunshine.  You know, that's just coincidence.  Who knows?  There's nothing in the grand scheme of things.  Who knows?  Who knows?  We're all just carbon units.  Who knows?  Walking around with some electricity in us.  That makes the frigging muscles move.  She was, she wasn't supposed to go.  And, uh, you know, she's, she went like two, two and a half weeks early, right in the middle.  Weeks early.  Right in the middle of our horrific, uh, weekend and, and had a nine pounder too. 
[00:05:30]  Wow.  You know what a nine pounder is like?  For early?  Yeah.  That's a little, wow.  And everything's, uh, normal.  So congrats to, to Quentin.  Well, good.  Ten fingers, ten toes.  That's right.  God bless.  God bless.  God bless.  Just wanted healthy there, Fez.  But it definitely, uh, it definitely lightened the weekend because it was just, it was just awful.  But then Saturday.  Yeah.  Then Saturday, happiness for everybody.  It's like, life is so stupid.  Life is stupid.  Emotional rollercoaster.  It's just dumb. 
[00:06:00]  Eek.  Don't even try to figure it out.  No.  Just enjoy the ride.  People that are trying to, try to figure it out are the people that you see in mental institutions.  Absolutely.  Just take it as it comes.  Absolutely.  Well, those are the ones that you can just at least have sex with while you're trying to figure it out.  You know, the ones in mental institutions.  Right, exactly.  Because I can't tell anyone.  It's so drugged up.  No one's going to believe him.  Yeah.  Have a cream puff, stupid.  He was in my room last night.  Oh, sure he was.  I'm sure he was.  You know what?  We hit a nerve.  Just a couple of these, but they're calling from all over the country. 
[00:06:30]  Rick in Nebraska.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  Six girls.  Just had one.  Six on Tuesday.  27.  I hear one more joke of, oh, you just keep blowing the nuts off of me.  Yeah.  I haven't heard that one before.  That old gag.  So.  Yeah.  How many kids did you want, Rick?  I wanted six, but I wanted a couple boys in there.  Oh, okay.  You did want six, though?  Oh, yeah.  Not a lot of kids. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  You've just sacrificed, like, any bit of freedom, and that's fine with you?  Like, you're just dad guy now, right?  Yeah.  I'm pretty much changing my job, whatever I do, you know?  How do you afford six kids?  I drive truck and don't stop.  And don't stop.  It's just, you're running and running and running and running all day long just to feed six mouths and to slap diapers on them, and I can't, oh, I'm a selfish bastard.  That's really funny.  I drive a truck and I don't stop. 
[00:07:30]  Keep on driving.  I was thinking, I was watching something, and they had a whole thing on guys that are so committed to their family tree and lineage and genealogy that they need to get married and have kids.  The marriage part, as far as them being happy or finding someone they're truly in love with, like, this whole thing you're supposed to have about marriage, goes out the window.  Yeah.  They're just looking to reproduce and need someone to do it with. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  So, as I'm watching this and I'm thinking, and I go, okay, I know my family.  I got me, my brother, and my sister.  We aren't having kids.  So, I'm thinking.  None of you guys.  I'm thinking.  Right?  No one in your family wants kids.  No one in my family wants kids.  This is the end of the line for this lineage, for this family tree branch.  It's over, Johnny, right here.  Right here.  You're looking at it.  A lot of talent in that family.  Let me tell you something, though.  It's not going to be passed on.  I'm thinking, what's better? 
[00:08:30]  And good genes.  Look at your mom, man.  Well, my mom's side, she's still got some things going.  We're just ending my dad's side of the family.  Screw it.  It's over, Johnny.  Whatever, you know, little Italian guys got on the boat and did all their things to come over here.  Sorry, Pasquale.  It's over.  You have a responsibility, you know.  No.  Generation after generation after generation.  And it ends right here.  And all I was thinking is, there was like a caveman that had sex with a cavewoman at some point. 
[00:09:00]  And started the branch going.  And dick, dick, dick.  There it goes.  It ticks up, up, up.  And people are having sex and having kids.  And it went to this branch right here.  And we are deciding to put a stop to it.  And there's Anthony Cumia.  Clip.  That's it.  Goodbye.  Snip.  Over, Johnny.  Give me a chainsaw.  I'm taking the whole thing down.  And I was thinking, I'm going, you know, that is better to me than just being in the middle  somewhere in some crowd of branches that just keep going. 
[00:09:30]  I want to be the end of the line.  Boom.  It stops right there.  Makes more of a statement.  Does it?  Go screw.  Does it?  What, are you just going to be another one in the food chain?  Oh, look at this branch.  It goes on forever and keeps going and branching off.  And you're just one of millions eventually that'll just be in that string of whatever  it is.  Cut it off.  Look at me.  I'm right at the top of this branch. 
[00:10:00]  What about Joe?  Joe ain't having no kids either.  None of them are.  And Dawn's not?  That's it.  It's over for the Cumias.  It's over.  Just stop it already.  Enough.  Man, you must have had a horrible childhood.  Who needs more dreck like us in the world?  You must have had a horrible childhood.  And then you're like, it ends here.  Because I know I would be a bad parent.  I had an alright childhood.  And then my children would be bad parents.  I'd probably be a good parent.  I think I'm not.  I'm too selfish.  I'm effing with you.  I really think you would be a good parent. 
[00:10:30]  I'm just too selfish.  If you decide to go down that road.  And greedy.  Yeah, but your kid would be selfish with you.  Don't you get it?  No.  You would be just, you know, father, son, just pricks together.  What do I want to, like, we're taking vacation, right?  I just want to bolt off somewhere.  I don't want kids.  I don't want pack and plays.  I don't want babysitters.  I don't want this, that, the other thing.  What if you just want to run off and go somewhere?  But see, you're lucky.  Like, you make good money now.  You could, like, see, why am I talking to you? 
[00:11:00]  And is that really a good thing to do to a child?  Hey, we want to just spontaneously take off and go to Europe for a month.  Hey, take care of this kid.  Get some housekeeper.  You bring the kid with you, but you have a full-time nanny and babies.  Is that how it works?  Why am I talking to you?  And you're not going to do this anyway.  I know, but I'm just.  But I'm just saying there's a way, there's ways around what you're thinking.  Because you're lucky enough to be making good money.  That's all.  There are people out there that are truly screwed that they're just stuck.  How do you get the baby smell out of your house? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, forget it.  You don't.  And the ways around what you're thinking is aim for the hair.  Forget it.  You guys are helpless.  That baby smell.  I will be having kids, and I will wreck this whole radio show.  Well, why?  You want kids, though.  That's not bad.  You want kids.  I will wreck this whole radio show.  Is it just going to be every day?  You know what?  Do you have a name picked out?  No, no, no.  No, no.  I'm not stupid.  I'm not.  Let me tell you what little Connor did today.  No, no, no.  Let me tell you.  Perfect name.  Glub.  Glub.  No.  No.  It's just how we've always done the show. 
[00:12:00]  We barely talk about our girls.  It comes up in conversation.  That's about it.  Yeah.  It is what it is.  As soon as you start focusing on your wife or your girlfriend or your kids, they're the  worst.  You've done.  I have seen comedians plummet into the realm of unfunny crap after they have kids.  So let me tell you something.  Well, you might have read in the news.  I had a kid a month ago. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, no need to.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  She's adorable.  Now let me go into what she did.  The only person, I'm not kissing ass, Jimmy, that makes that funny is Louis CK because it  is brutal.  Yeah.  It is brutal stuff about how kids, my kid's retarded.  It's stupid.  It's just annoying to have around.  Well, he tells the truth.  And he treats it like that.  My kid sucks.  It's really funny.  Yeah.  But the people that are just like, oh, it's so funny and what she did in this. 
[00:13:00]  I don't want to hear it.  No one cares.  Your kid's not special.  It's not smarter than everyone else's kid.  It's just another carbon unit with electricity going through it.  We're not special in general as human beings.  I was staying at a hotel in Long Island because, you know, I'm still homeless.  It continues.  I am homeless.  The saga.  I'm getting closer to hopefully buying a place, but I am officially homeless and living out  of hotels and living out of the place that I have been right now. 
[00:13:30]  I hope you're living hand to mouth.  That's right.  So I'm at this hotel in Long Island that specializes in weddings and stuff, and every morning I'm  just seeing just people that were at the wedding last night at the buffet, and then  the next day it's the same people, but it's not.  Different, but the same.  And you know how special that day is to them in there at that moment?  But I see like the bride sitting at the same table the bride sat at yesterday at the buffet  with the ass coming over, and then the people that are leaving early because they've got 
[00:14:00]  to catch a plane.  Yeah.  But we had a great time.  We had a great time.  God bless.  I was taking this all in.  I'm like, this is two separate weddings, but it could be the same exact family.  You're not special.  No one's special.  No one's special.  Let's go to Kenny.  Kenny, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Kenny.  I love the show, man.  And you're absolutely right.  I got four boys, 12, 11.  We don't care of their ages.  Yeah, and they're not special. 
[00:14:30]  They're fucking annoying.  Excuse my language.  Oh, yes.  Please excuse.  Yes.  And yeah, I just love you guys.  I just had to let you know, I ain't trying anymore.  The next person that says to me, hey, you're going for the girl?  No, I'm not.  It's like you're going, like they're collectibles.  You only have this one?  Right.  You know, you need the girl to complete the set.  No, no.  I don't need anything but more money and less bills.  Well, there's a lot of people out there, they do some family planning.  They say, all right, we'll have three kids.  But in their mind, they're like, as long as one's a boy, one's a girl, and then the third 
[00:15:00]  one is a toss-up, whether it's a boy or a girl, who cares?  But as soon as you get three in a row, you're like, oh, those three kids all of a sudden  turn into four, to five, and it just keeps going.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  I know two comics that, like, Voss and Vinnie Bram both have kids.  Both really like being parents.  It hasn't affected either one of them as far as what they do.  You know, because Vinnie's kind of a sociopath, and Voss is just a dope.  I mean, it hasn't affected him.  Voss didn't like, it seems like, anyway, time-wise, as far as I know, Voss's life, he 
[00:15:30]  didn't, he wasn't a comic and then had kids.  It seems like he got into it.  Did he already have kids when he got into it?  I think he was a comic first, no.  Really?  No, but he was just cleaning up, he was doing drugs, too.  He was awful back then, anyway.  Yeah, so I guess the kid's kind of coming along with just, oh, I have kids?  Who knows?  Where's my crack?  Well, I think it works if you're a comedian, if you take a different angle, like Louis C.K.  Yeah.  The problem is, a lot of these comedians that have the kids like you were saying, it's the  same crap that you've heard a million times from other comedians and your own friends.  Or just parents. 
[00:16:00]  Or whatever.  But if you're brave enough to take that different look at it or that different angle, then you  might have a chance to bring that into your act.  You know what I enjoy watching with kids when we have family over with kids running around?  I don't know what it is, but it cracks me up when they beat the crap out of each other.  You're sick.  Like, they're outside, and I know I'm not supposed to be laughing, but one will actually try to  gouge the other's eyes out.  Do you laugh?  Or hit him with a rock over the head, and I am hysterical laughing. 
[00:16:30]  Do you laugh when a kid cries?  Oh, the best thing in the world is when you're at the supermarket or something, and a kid  falls flat on his face, and that loud crying, I really laugh at it.  See, if the kid is not related to my family, and it's crying, and I have no vested interest  or whatever in the kid, I have no problem going out or whatever and kind of smirking.  But when it's someone that you are related to, it's a sad thing. 
[00:17:00]  It's not sad.  It's a sad thing.  I just find it hysterical.  If I'm in the supermarket, and there's a kid in the little seat in the cart, I'll sometimes  try to make them cry by either making a scary face, like that, or sometimes you go like,  I'm going to kill your mommy.  You don't do that.  And they burst out crying, and you just start looking at the sauce on the side.  You do.  And they cry.  Do you really?  Oh, yeah.  I'll say evil things to them.  You're sick. 
[00:17:30]  Like, your daddy's dead.  You are sick.  Yeah.  And the...  And then you just pick out things.  You take it that far?  Why not?  Yeah.  They're right there.  I will stare down a little kid that's, you know, acting up in a restaurant or a public place.  You got to wish for horrible things to them.  You are sick.  As long as they're not old enough to rat you out.  Like, you know, just enough where they can understand kind of what you're saying.  You're twisted.  Like, harming parent thing.  And then they just start crying, and the mother's like, oh, what's the matter? 
[00:18:00]  And you're just laughing, looking at groceries, whistling as...  Why don't you just put a cigarette on his hand, Simon?  I don't smoke.  Oh.  Believe me, I would.  All right.  Listen, we're just getting started.  The little things.  Website updates.  Because there seems to be a ton of new videos up on opieandanthony.com.  Ooh.  Tippy Tom versus Anthony.  That's finally up.  The video's up.  All weekend, I looked for it.  All weekend.  I guess it's up, because they're telling me it's up.  Better be.  Also, Tippy Tom on the walkover buying gay porn and singing about beer. 
[00:18:30]  Huh?  Tippy Tom tries to seduce homeless Andrew.  Opie gets assaulted on the walk by the Mexican midget.  That's up there.  Us yelling at old guy with loud dog.  Jim Norton playing the piano.  It just goes on and on and on.  So check out the new videos up on opieandanthony.com.  Also, something I'm just obsessed with.  I can't help it.  I go to YouTube every day now, and I just throw in Opie and Anthony in the search engine  and watch all the videos that are up there.  Sure, it pops up.  YouTube is huge. 
[00:19:00]  Well, no, it's weird, because I know all the videos that are up on our website, but  with YouTube, the videos could come from anywhere.  And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, you're looking at a video clip going, when was this?  Yeah, what the hell is that?  You remember Billy Staples?  Of course.  Dressing up as Chris Farley at Mulcahy's?  Yeah, and throwing himself into the crowd.  On Long Island?  We used to do these crazy road shows, and there were like a couple thousand people in the bar.  And Billy Staples decides to stage dive?  Yeah.  And he was about, help me out, 350? 
[00:19:30]  At least.  At least, right?  And he's dressed up like Chris Farley.  He's doing the whole-  Sweating like a pig.  The whole, what was his character on that?  The guy that used to-  The motivational speaker.  What was his name, though?  Live in a van down by the river.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is going to kill him all day.  No, it won't.  It's because someone on his feedback will get him in a second.  Matt Foley.  Oh, yeah, Matt Foley.  Thanks.  There it is.  And all of a sudden, he jumps off the stage, thinking everyone was going to catch him, or he was going  to stage dive and kind of surf the crowd.  Everyone got petrified, and even though the place was packed and he couldn't move, they 
[00:20:00]  parted like the Red Sea, and BAM!  Belly flop right on the floor.  I was watching that on YouTube over the weekend.  I'm like, where did this come from?  Yeah, YouTube is on to something.  Every video now that somebody has posted somewhere is on YouTube.  Yeah.  I finally kind of figured it out.  Centralized all that crap.  Yeah, the shower rape video we did at the ONA traveling virus.  Yeah.  Being watched like crazy on opiananthony.com, on YouTube. 
[00:20:30]  Yep.  Whatever.  So, really fast, too, we got to talk to Steve, because I was thinking over the weekend that  opiananthony.com, we should have kind of a section where it's a look back, and bring  back some of these.  A look back.  But bring back some of these videos that are so buried within the website, no one's  ever going to find them, and bring them back up to the surface.  Blind boxing.  All that stuff.  The girl shooting the bottle rocket out of her you-know-what.  Yes.  All that stuff, but have a featured, you know, kind of maybe classic opiananthony-whatever  section. 
[00:21:00]  The egg toss by the girl.  All that stuff.  That's what I was thinking over the weekend.  Having the blind guy catch it in a basket.  Right.  As she fired it out like a human howitzer.  We got to talk to Steve, but have a section, and then like have five or six videos.  They're up there, and then just rotate new ones in from the past.  Yeah.  I think that'd be great, because when I saw that Billy Staples thing, you know, stage  dive, I'm like, oh my God, there's so much stuff out there that the new listeners have  no clue about.  Get it up there.  All right.  We're just getting started.  We got to talk about Fidel Castro.  It's the first photo of Fidel is out. 
[00:21:30]  Is it?  Anthony's got some observations on that.  And boy, the New York Post, who had no problem calling us despicable and all that, they have  no problem having a boyfriend shooting his girlfriend on the front page of the New York  Post today.  Point blank, gun at her head, surveillance video, so it's kind of cloudy or whatever, but you  can see exactly what's going on here.  That's their front page today.  And then you'll go in four pages or so, and there's a bunch of still pictures of the 
[00:22:00]  whole thing, killed her, killed himself.  Yeah, we'll walk through that after the break.  One of those fun things.  All right, man.  If you don't love me anymore, you're dead.  It's Monday.  It's time to rock again.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, the One Virus spreading across America.  I don't have kids.  I want porno on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off because you had kids.  All you people with your children make me effing sick.  We're psychotic. 
[00:22:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, the One Virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  I think we have to say hi to Cape Cod today, huh?  We're on in Cape Cod.  Do we?  Yeah.  The virus is spreading to the point where we're losing track.  I thought we were on Cape Cod already.  That's how it works.  Well, we did the big intro last week, and then we realized once again we weren't on yet. 
[00:23:00]  Hey there, Cape Cat.  That happened a few times.  The phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Lucky us here in the New York area.  Idol has come to town.  The American Idol tryouts.  What are they saying?  10,000.  10,000 are.  There's a live shot on our TV here in New York.  Oh, my God.  There's 10,000 lined up to audition for American Idol, and they're all excited to see Simon Cowell, 
[00:23:30]  and these dopes have no idea that Simon's in L.A.  Yeah, they're not there.  They're not going to see him this early on.  They go through two judgings before they even see the celebrity judges, Simon and Paula Abdul.  But these idiots, they think they're waiting in line to go in front of the three of them, Randy and Paula and Simon.  One girl was wearing a tank top, and it said something about Randy on it, and the newswoman pointed out, 
[00:24:00]  you're not even going to see any of them.  You've got to get through a couple of judgings before that.  And she was like, oh.  She thought she was going to go there, and it was going to be just like the TV show.  People are dopes.  They really are.  Like they're going to sit there like Paula Abdul sits and watches 10,000 people per city.  They run you past probably like a cattle call.  They just run you past one producer that just goes, yes, yes, no, before you open your mouth just on appearance alone. 
[00:24:30]  They have one producer that his whole job is to just get rid of the fatties.  Fatties gone, but you've got to keep a couple of fatties.  But they give you another dude.  The right fatties.  But that's his whole job.  He has no clue if you have a good voice or not.  He just knows looks.  He's like, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  And basically what he's doing is he's kicking the fatties off the line.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, and the fugglies.  And the fugglies and the undesirables.  The undesirables.  I was talking to a girl who's actually doing this going after the audition, and she had to get there two days ago to get a wristband. 
[00:25:00]  On Friday they go, they'd wait in line for a long time, get a wristband, then come back at 5 o'clock this morning and get on line.  Well, they were playing some people.  They had the newswomen there, and they're micing some of the people and saying, why don't you give us a little song?  And they're singing, and it's so awful.  Why did you get up and wait this long?  I think we got some of that.  Do you know the old phrase, the early bird gets the worm?  Well, here at Continental Airlines, the early bird is hoping to get the title of American Idol. 
[00:25:30]  And there is a one-in-seven chance, and that can happen right here in New York because American Idol is doing its seven-city tour.  This is stop three on the tour, and this is Timothy, who came all the way from Baltimore, Maryland.  Are you warmed up?  Are you ready to sing?  By the way.  All right, let's hear it, baby.  By the way, Timothy.  Yeah.  Odd, you never see this on American Idol.  Would appear to be a gay black gentleman.  Really?  Yeah, which you never see on American Idol.  Timothy, just go home.  Did you sing?  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's hear it, baby. 
[00:26:00]  You got it.  Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby?  Go home.  You said you'll be coming back this way again.  Go, Timothy.  See that song, Timothy?  It's going to be a long morning.  And I'm right here.  Let's hear it.  I believe the children of you can take.  Teach them with them and let them lead the way.  Now, you guys, it's unbelievable. 
[00:26:30]  These people started coming out here at 2 a.m. this morning, but it won't be until 8 a.m.  that they get to walk in through those doors.  That's when they will audition for a producer.  It's just the first round.  If they get through today, they'll have second rounds, and it's not until round three that  they'll actually see Paula, Simon, and Randy.  Say, they line up.  Yeah.  They have maybe 15 seconds in front of these other judges.  You know, the first judge is purely just yes, no, yes, yes, no, no, yes.  Like a boxcar.  Yeah.  Thumbs up, thumbs down. 
[00:27:00]  You can work.  You can't.  You know that's what it's like.  And then the second judge, then they probably can blurt out, you know, 15 seconds worth  of a song, and then you're gone, gone, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, and then they get to the  portion that you see for television.  All right, more audio.  You have a few first round judges, I'm sure.  There's no way you walk into one.  There's 10,000 people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's probably, yeah, I'm sure, a bunch of them.  They divvy them up between a bunch of producers, and they just, no, go, goodbye. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, I'm thinking it's just, yeah.  It's 10,000.  How long did that take?  It's got to be, I would say, 20, 30 minimum producers, right?  Yeah.  Got to be.  The crowd is incredible.  It stretches all the way around.  This is Vandell.  He's from Brooklyn.  Vandell got out here at 11 o'clock last night, but his pipes are warmed up this morning.  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Why shattered dreams and broken hearts are mending all in shit. 
[00:28:00]  You guys, in front of the...  How appropriate.  Those are the lyrics he's singing.  Shattered dreams and broken hearts.  Because that's what most of you are going to have.  What's with the vocal acrobatics everyone's got to do?  Just sing a goddamn song.  That guy doesn't have one person in his life to tell him that singing's not for him.  Who do we have to blame for that?  Is that Mariah?  Is that really who we got to blame for that?  Oh, my brother used to call it, what, vocal gymnastics or something like that? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Vocal acrobatics.  Acrobatics or whatever.  We're going...  Shut up.  But it's moving.  It's...  But it's...  You guys, in front of the judges, thank you very much.  Each person, if they're lucky, if they're lucky, will get 30 seconds in front of a producer today.  That's just 30 seconds.  But they've got hours to wait to get to that point.  And here we have Cynthia, and I've got to show you her shirt because she's already claiming she's Randy's hot one. 
[00:29:00]  So I am.  So you're ready.  Randy's not going to be here today.  These are just early stages of producers.  But you're ready.  I heard you singing a New York song.  Let's hear it.  Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood.  Hop a flight to Miami Beach or Hollywood.  Go, girl.  I think I see Hollywood in your future.  Do you really, white reporter?  As a stripper. 
[00:29:30]  Go, girl.  Shut up.  You go, girl.  Oh, go.  It was a little pitchy dog.  Don't talk to the hand.  Shut up.  You guys ready for some...  Steve from Bayshore first talking about the vocal acrobatics.  I blame Tarzan.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to go back that far, but good point, Steve.  Good point.  Are you guys ready for the playful banter between the news people?  No, I'm not.  Well, people just pull over on their shoulder and strap on your laughing hats. 
[00:30:00]  And our boy, Mike Wood.  Yeah.  Or is it Woods?  Who cares?  Whatever.  I think it might be Mike Wood.  He didn't disappoint today at all.  Oh, he's a classic.  What did he say today?  Just saw some awfulness.  Because they were talking about how you have to be between the ages of 16 and 28, so they're  all joking that they're all 29, so they just missed.  Well, I'm 29 here.  They just missed the gun off, Bob.  And then, hey, who's laughing?  Oh.  What did Mike Wood say?  Darr. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Darr.  Darr.  The guy, now when they go to him, I can't resist.  I have to look.  He gets this look in his eyes of utter fear and terror.  Oh, God, don't ask me anything too hard.  Oh, they're asking me something.  Oh, my age, I'm 29 like you guys.  Sam brought up a great point in the office earlier.  We were talking about Mike and how he just has no clue how to ad-lib.  And it's like the guy in school that had the report that was very good and reads his report 
[00:31:00]  to the class, and then the teacher asks him a question about it, and he just goes, um,  and looks down.  Like, he does a report on Lincoln, and it's like, well, why did Lincoln decide that that  was best for our country?  And he just goes, um, and starts flipping through the pages.  You know, you get him off the script, it's over.  And that's Mike Wood.  The guy doesn't know how to ad-lib, so he freezes.  He freezes.  He's back in the classroom hoping the teacher doesn't call on him.  Yeah, don't call on me. 
[00:31:30]  Just, I do weather.  That's all I do.  Please don't.  Oh, no, they're asking me a question.  Oh, no.  Don't make me ad-lib about American Idol.  I don't have a clue.  There's a funny thought to be had.  He just fumbles it in the backfield.  Oh, he does.  Oh, we do have it?  Okay.  It's horrible.  Today's isn't as good as other days, but it makes us laugh every day.  It's an example.  I bet someone told him that he's getting trashed on the radio.  Someone said he's probably told him he's getting bad-mouthed.  I was thinking that because he looks so scared.  Oh, my God, Ann, we're on the same page.  I thought the same thing today because they went to Mike and they asked him something.  I'm like, I think he's ad-lib. 
[00:32:00]  He's petrified because it's getting back to him.  I can't talk to nothing.  No.  Playing your audios.  With low pressure.  I'm the low pressure system.  Night on the dog, Alice.  Ah, you know, American Idol.  Good points, stupid.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  It was a big buildup.  I mean, the banter in general is pretty.  Oh, there he is again.  I can't get enough of this guy.  I can't get enough of his tiny head.  Such a tool.  He has a shrunken head.  It's like he insulted a witch doctor at one point. 
[00:32:30]  He has a little head that no funny thoughts come out of him.  A little tiny head.  A little head.  Look how brave we are.  Void of humor.  He obviously works out like 12 hours a day.  His head looks small.  Hence, his body is huge.  Right.  All right, here we go.  The dumb banter, and I think Mike gives us a little something at the end of this.  Thank goodness.  So we've got a mama here who's very upset because, what were you telling me?  They need to start American Idol for old folks.  That's right, guys.  To audition today, you've got to be 16 to 28. 
[00:33:00]  And guess what, Lucy?  That means I'm out.  I know.  You know, since we're both 29, Ann, I'm out too.  Gosh darn it.  Gosh darn it.  Don't laugh.  Why are you guys laughing about that?  Everybody's laughing around here like I'm not.  By the way, she's the one saying that they're all 29.  We were obsessed with her boobs today because we think she bronzed her boobs to give herself fake cleavage.  You bronze the boobage, and then in the cleavage, you put in some white tone, and it makes it look like you've actually painted breasts on yourself. 
[00:33:30]  She made up her boobs this morning for TV.  And then she has some, what did you say?  Some big Maya necklace that looked like she was from Stargate or something.  I don't know what she was wearing around her neck.  Look, that's all the rage with the chicks, man.  You got to get the big Inca jewelry and awful Inca jewelry.  But she says that, like I said, 29, everybody's laughing.  Yeah.  Who's laughing at that?  Like, who's sitting around?  Oh, gosh darn it, Jimmy.  29.  We know she's a cougar.  Who's enjoying that comedically? 
[00:34:00]  How is that funny to anybody?  It would be funny if Mike Wood jumped in and said, ha, ha, ha, we all know your woman parts dried up years ago.  Speaking of dry, we won't see any rain this week.  That's right.  You don't ovulate, because raisins can't do that.  Wow.  That'd be a good one.  Yeah, come on, Mike.  Just hit him between the eyes.  Wow, he can ad-lib. 
[00:34:30]  He'd be my new hero.  Gosh darn it.  Gosh darn it.  Don't laugh.  How do you guys laughin' about that?  Everybody's laughin' around here like I'm not 29 or something, man.  We know.  We get it.  We get the joke.  We get the joke.  Why?  First of all, she said, ah, they're laughin'.  Everybody's laughin'.  She's laughin' three times.  Who's laughing?  You're the one laughing at your own dumb joke there.  Well, then I believe I'm 29.  Tell an awful joke, stress how everybody's laughing, and then explain it.  She should shoot herself.  And then realize... 
[00:35:00]  And then you realize she's the only one laughing.  Yeah.  We're all having a ball over here.  I can't get enough of the party.  Everybody's laughin' and clappin' and high-fivin'.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You get it?  I'm not quite...  Ah, I'm 30, 29, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Whore.  Like a spit of blueberry right off her nipple.  But she's crying on the inside.  Yeah, you know she is.  Her best years are behind her. 
[00:35:30]  Gone.  Hi, Nan.  I'm out, too.  Gosh darn it.  Don't laugh.  Why are you guys laughing about that?  Everybody's laughin' around here like I'm not 29 or something, Anne.  No one's laughing.  I don't know what's up with that.  All right.  Thank you.  That's not funny at all.  I don't think it is, either.  5.41 now at the time.  Still ahead on Good Day Wake Up.  We have a live report from Israel on the ceasefire that went into effect this morning.  Now, of course, we told you about that breaking news.  The ceasefire was hilarious.  Did you listen to the news this morning? 
[00:36:00]  They all got their last licks.  Oh, the heaviest fighting ever in the time that they've been fighting.  What, a few weeks now?  Almost a month?  What is it?  It's a U.N. thing?  Yeah, it's just a ceasefire.  Not peace, not some kind of treaty.  They had to stop first thing in the morning.  First thing in the morning, 1 a.m. our time.  So last licks were just brutal.  Devastating.  Just brutal.  250 rockets launched into Israel.  Right.  Ground troops in Lebanon. 
[00:36:30]  Tanks just blowing everything up.  And then, you know what?  A whistle blows and you stop.  And they shake hands and go, all right, well.  How stupid are we?  See you in another month.  Yeah, all right.  We'll see how long this lasts.  I predict some type of break in the treaty by, let me see, what time is it?  Give it to noon.  I predict end of the world.  End of the world.  That's a good one.  Okay.  Hezbollah will break it, though. 
[00:37:00]  Someone will fire a rocket into Israel because they're not a government.  Yeah.  They're always broken by the radicals because they're not governments.  They don't think that's going to the U.N.  Believe me, somebody will fire one in and then Israel will come right back.  Oh, the whole thing starts again.  Well, you know, I'm on 28th.  Why is everyone laughing?  Last licks, though.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's like when they're breaking up a fight and you just get those last punch or kick and  punches it.  Stomp.  Good morning.  Now, of course, we told you about that breaking news.  Shots fired already.  We'll tell you more coming up.  And the Department of Homeland Security adjusting the threat level for some international flights. 
[00:37:30]  It's what the change is and what security officials are focusing on now, Mike Woods.  There we go.  All right.  And right now, things are looking pretty decent for starters on this Monday morning, but they  head downhill through.  No, it's great.  All right.  Here you go, Mike Wood.  And he just right into his weather.  Yeah.  No, he doesn't try to talk about anything that's going on because he knows he's awful at it.  But she has to stop him to ask the 29th question.  This is listening again.  All right. 
[00:38:00]  And right now, things are looking pretty decent for starters on this Monday morning, but they  head downhill through the day and into tomorrow.  I'll tell you what I'm talking about coming right up.  And Mike, you're looking mighty fine for 29 as well, I might add.  Oh, thank you so much.  Yeah.  Boss 5 traffic, 30 track in the morning hot spot.  Wow.  Yeah.  Listen to the nervous.  It's not even the thank you so much.  Trust me, there's not much there, but we see a lot into it.  It's not the thank you so much that's so telling as is the...  Because he's trying to think of something else to add to thank you so much. 
[00:38:30]  You know what it is?  But he just...  It's like when you're in the classroom, the teacher calls on you, like, oh, my God.  But then they ask the easy question, like, oh, the sign, that's easy.  Yeah.  That's what he was like just there, like, oh, that's an easy one.  But he wanted to add something, and you hear, like, at the end.  Oh, is he lost?  How great would it be if Mike Woods finally...  All right.  How about this?  Let's role play.  All right.  I'll be the non-improving black gentleman.  Yes.  And you be the gal. 
[00:39:00]  And you say, uh, Mike, you're looking pretty good for 29.  Mike, you're looking pretty good for 29.  How many times are you going to do the same joke, bitch?  I've heard it four times.  Oh, good God.  I'm not 29.  I'm an older man.  All right, you...  Shut up.  Yeah.  Well, your breath smells like a big hairy...  Let's go to Neil.  Neil.  Neil in Cape Cod.  Neil.  Hey, man.  Hey, Neil. 
[00:39:30]  Am I on?  Yes, you are, Neil.  Welcome aboard.  You are on, Neil.  I just...  I'm listening to you guys for a short time.  Good.  Thanks a lot, Neil.  It's appreciated.  Godspeed.  Thank you, Neil.  Thank you, Neil.  Thanks a lot for giving the program a shot.  I'm just saying that I want my music back.  Ah, Neil.  We appreciate that very much.  Glad you're tuning in.  Thank you, Neil.  Keep listening, buddy.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for supporting the program, Neil.  It's appreciated, Neil, buddy.  Neil in Cape Cod.  It's wonderful that we can be there now.  Part of the Cape Cod family.  Glad you enjoy, Neil. 
[00:40:00]  Thanks for hanging in there and giving us a shot, Neil.  Neil, Pixie 103, what kind of music do they play in the morning before us?  It's classic rock, man.  Oh, cool classic rock.  One of my favorites.  Thanks a lot for not missing that at all and enjoying us.  Godspeed, Neil.  So what do you like?  What's your favorite bands there, Neil, that you're missing right now?  I like The Who, man.  The Who?  The Who?  How about some Neil Young, huh?  Godspeed.  Thanks for tuning in, Neil.  I like The Who.  Love The Who.  I'm just kidding.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thanks, Neil.  You bastard.  Neil, you like the show? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I love it.  I hate this ass.  I was really hoping for, I want my music back, guy, because we do always get him.  Yeah.  I was gearing up for my famous line, well, go get an iPod.  I live over on the West Coast, so I never get to call you guys.  All right on.  Thanks.  You got like, we should get Opie through the years.  Oh, go get an 8-track.  Go get a cassette.  Go get a CD.  Go get a CD Walkman.  Go get a Walkman. 
[00:41:00]  Go get a laser disc.  Go get an MP3 player.  Get a Victrola and a Lucky Strike cigarette.  All right.  We got to take a break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Why is everyone laughing at that?  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy.  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Dick.  Where do you go when you want to change the line? 
[00:41:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  I love you too, sweetness.  If you walk past them, they'll take your jewelry and take your purse and whatever, you know.  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Freaking up.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show?  Yes.  Okay.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:42:00]  That's right.  This be the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O-N-A virus spreading across America.  We got Steve in studio.  We're going on vacation after Friday's show for only a week.  It's time, though.  We got to, like, rest up.  I want to vacation until Christmas.  It's time.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Need a little vacation.  We got to recharge.  Where are you going?  Anywhere cool?  I'm going to the Outer Banks.  The Outer Banks?  And don't try finding me.  The Outer Banks?  I'm not going to say how cool it is because then everyone else is going to go to the Outer Banks.  Yeah?  Do people go there?  Yeah.  It's blowing up.  Yeah?  Wild horses with, uh, with, uh...  Things horses used to mate with? 
[00:43:00]  Why were you...  Wow.  Is that what you go there for?  That was...  To see giant horse junk?  That was quite a sight last year for all the kitties.  Yeah?  Anyway, when we get back, we're going to attempt...  When we first went back on commercial radio, we've been on satellite for almost two years, by the way.  And we should do something for our two-year anniversary, being back on radio, which is October 3rd of this year.  We should do something special.  Last year, remember how lame it was, our one-year anniversary? 
[00:43:30]  We had, like, the Schneider call, and that was it?  Yeah, that was it.  We were trying to get something going, and it just wasn't.  We make this huge comeback to radio on XM, and then we're at XM for a year, and we're expecting this big to-do.  Yeah.  And it was nothing.  That was a tough year one, man.  It was like Eric Logan called us, our boss, and Dee Schneider, like...  And I think they sent up balloons or something.  Yikes.  Thank you.  That's a start-studded. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah, so that's October 3rd.  When we get back...  Oh, this is what I was going to say.  So when we got back on commercial radio, right out of the box, we were trying to get some crazy things going on in the studio,  thinking, you know, we had such a huge audience that was just waiting for us to come back to radio.  Yeah.  And they would be banging, knocking down the doors to get in here to do whatever we said.  Mm-hmm.  Remember we tried to get the girls in bras and panties to crawl around blindfolded among mousetraps?  Mousetraps, yeah, to pick up cash.  And all these girls, they called, I'll be there, their boyfriends called, my... 
[00:44:30]  It was tickets, right?  It was tickets for...  Was it?  Tool tickets.  Tool tickets, right.  And the phones went nuts, and everyone promised they would be here.  Day of the event, we laid out all the mousetraps, we got the tool tickets, we're ready to go.  Yeah.  Not one girl showed up.  Not one broad.  We looked so stupid.  This was our first week back on commercial radio.  One week back.  We failed miserably.  One week back, and then we thought that was going to be it.  Well, we're back. 
[00:45:00]  We're back a week.  We could get anyone in here.  Yeah.  Complete and utter failure.  So we're going to be going away for a week.  When we get back that Tuesday, which I guess would be officially two weeks from tomorrow?  Two weeks from tomorrow, yeah.  We want to attempt to get the girls back down here in their bras and panties with their  blindfolds, mousetraps all over the studio, and at least $1,000 down?  More, yeah.  More than $1,000?  Well, that whole week we're giving away $1,000 a day. 
[00:45:30]  So we're going to take a couple of those days and combine it into one for this contract.  How about we throw $2,500 down on the ground?  Whoa.  Under every mousetrap.  That's a lot of them.  We should make our own contest a bust.  They're blindfolded, and the $2,500 is piled under one lousy mousetrap.  Someone grabs it right away.  Well, we're cheap.  We have $40 to give away. 
[00:46:00]  So we're getting...  That's 4-0, my friend.  We've upped the ante.  Last time was for tool tickets.  No one showed up, even though they said they would.  Two weeks from tomorrow, $2,500 on the studio floor.  They'll show up for that.  Oh, yeah.  How many contestants do we want?  1,000.  1,000 contestants.  Six?  Six girls.  Or six.  Or six.  However many is more feasible.  We want six girls.  Yes.  Do we want desperate girls? 
[00:46:30]  Certainly.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Steve.  Why not?  Now, the desperate girl thing we do around Christmas, because it's so much fun when they're counting  their money naked and crying, because now they can buy their Christmas gifts for their  kids.  That is a treat to watch.  You know what we should do?  We should have someone from the IRS here.  And as soon as they walk out this door, they're taxed.  They're assessed for taxes due.  Perhaps even arrested.  See, these are some of the videos, Steve, we could throw up on opiananthony.com, a look 
[00:47:00]  back, classic Opie and Anthony.  The girl naked, just counting her pile of money.  Counting her money.  Crying.  Crying her eyes out, going, now I can afford gifts for my daughter this Christmas.  Oh, that was the best.  That was a touching day.  I can now buy my child Christmas gifts.  I want to thank you guys so much.  She's naked, crying.  The money smelled like garbage juice.  And she's crying so hard, her boobs are bouncing up and down.  Hey, thanks.  Anything we can do for you there, honey?  No problem.  We're all about charity, sweetie. 
[00:47:30]  Clean yourself up.  Get out of here.  Yeah, two weeks from tomorrow.  How do the girls get a hold of you, Steve?  And we're going to overbook, like a flight.  Oh, yeah.  Like a flight, we're overbooking.  Details are on the website.  You can email me, steve at foundrymusic.com, with your contact info, and we'll be in touch.  Oh, there's boy George going out on garbage cleaning detail.  Apparently, he's got to serve some community service.  What was his crime?  Drugs?  Like that?  A little dope?  Cocaine.  A little coke. 
[00:48:00]  So, the news is all over this, that he's got to go out now, I guess.  Is he going to go out with the stick, with the point on it?  I guess.  And pick up papers?  Or is he going to, like, ride on a garbage truck?  Or what's he going to do?  He's probably just on the side of the highway for a few days.  Who cares?  Community service?  That's not community service.  Oh, look at how the mighty have fallen.  They're showing him dancing around in his 80s regalia.  They're actually interviewing people.  What do they think about this?  Well, this is, all right, we got to get this. 
[00:48:30]  WB-11.  He is man George now.  Just man George.  There's no boy left in that.  He's big and fat.  He's got no makeup on.  You see what he does with his makeup now?  When he puts it on?  It looks like he drips candle wax on his head.  So that, like, streams down.  And then he does something to his neck with this black paint to make it look like he's not fat.  Like, don't pay no attention to where I painted black.  It does not exist.  I don't have jowls and a fat neck.  He's like Darth George. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, like they just pulled the helmet off.  All right.  Well, I have to plug something, but I don't want to do it when there's no time.  Ooh.  What do you got?  There's plenty of time.  Go.  What do you got?  But it's for the...  I'm doing a big New York show.  You are.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Where?  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Where? 
[00:49:30]  Hammerstein Ballroom, November 10th.  Tickets are going on sale this Wednesday, August 16th.  I'll put details up tomorrow, but it's my only New York show.  So if you want to come in November, come.  Of course they want to go.  Hammerstein.  Very nice.  Part of the New York Comedy Festival.  Love it.  That info will be up on opiananthony.com.  Speaking of Jimmy, Tom in Boston has something.  Tom?  Oh, no.  Hi, what's up?  Hey.  Hi, man.  No, and that shirt you were wearing last night, Lucky Louie, the Opie and Anthony shirt?  Yeah.  Is there any organization I can donate money to for crippled children to get one of those? 
[00:50:00]  No, sorry.  It was made specially for that.  I knew I was wearing a sweater, so they gave me a couple different designs where the name would show.  I wanted it to be like that, so the name would show.  And they dyed it a weird color, I think, to make it look too beat up.  So that's why it was like a weird light lettering, only because the original copy I had, it was too nice looking.  They're like, this is too nice of a shirt for Rich to own.  It's just, it's not beat up enough.  For Rich.  Yeah.  Oh, it was beautiful.  Oh, I mean for me. 
[00:50:30]  I mean, I used to become the character.  I don't remember.  You know, he's taught me so much in these weeks.  I've learned a lot about myself.  I've learned that, you know, Jim Norton's not a good actor.  I mean, Rich has taught me so many things.  Oh, I hate when they say that.  I've learned so much from her.  Yeah.  What?  You?  You mean you?  You mean who?  Playing the person that you, the script was that you learned something from.  You learned about yourself?  What?  She's so much stronger than I am, and I've gained strength from her.  Oh, the fake person that you're playing? 
[00:51:00]  The made up person that someone wrote that you're reading as?  Stop it with that, the dramatic, the overdramatic actor crap.  Even better when they take on one of these roles, all of a sudden they believe in that  cause for the three, four months the film's out.  Yeah, then it just.  And then it's like, God, global warming, screw that.  Who cares?  I'm now playing a whore in my next movie.  Yeah.  I've had a dance on a pole, and what happened to the save the children bit?  But all of a sudden they're on Larry King talking about global warming or whatever. 
[00:51:30]  Like they're experts because it was written down in a script.  Yeah, because they're playing a part in a movie, but as soon as the movie bombs, it's like,  oh, yeah, whatever.  Global warming's overrated.  She is so much stronger than I am.  The courage that I've taken away from this character.  Why don't people just talk about acting honestly?  So tell us about the role.  I was pretending.  It's like a world, only it's make-believe.  Right.  And people write things for me to say, and I say them in a way that comes off natural. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I hope it sounds good and looks good because I'm pretending.  Hey, Steve, did we give out the address where to get a hold of you if you wanted to do the  mousetrap thing?  Certainly did.  All right, do that again.  Just for kicks, steve at foundrymusic.com.  All right, if you want to crawl around in the mousetraps, I just want to make sure it  gets enough plugs.  Right.  Yeah, I didn't get to see Lucky Louie yet because it's too late for me.  I got to sleep.  I'm not like you, Jimmy.  I have to do like seven hours sleep.  Stevie Art it.  No, I'll watch it today, but everyone emailed me saying that 
[00:52:30]  you wore the Opie and Anthony shirt last night, and it was very, very cool, so awesome.  And if you want an Opie and Anthony t-shirt, my brother's still paying for Ziggy's van,  so please go buy a t-shirt at myradiostore.com.  It's an installment plan.  Well, officially the van has been totaled.  What?  Yeah, so...  It looked like a scratch on the roof.  Just but a flesh wound.  According to the insurance company, it's a totaled vehicle.  Holy mother of...  My brother's so screwed, so please buy one of his stupid t-shirts. 
[00:53:00]  How much did he have to pay?  Did it crush down, like on the front end, and wrecked that?  Well, that whole added-on-to-conversion-van roof was caved in with a huge dent, and that  damage, if it exceeds, obviously, the whole worth of the vehicle.  Oh, I gotcha.  For the new listeners, it was a...  Totaled.  He was going into a garage, it said 6'8", and the van is like 7'2".  Yeah.  So he totaled the big van that had our pictures on the side of it, and XM, and this and that,  and it's my brother's fault, so it's a whole deal. 
[00:53:30]  So go buy a stupid t-shirt.  How much did that cost?  Yeah, help him out.  Myradiostore.com.  I don't know, I don't know.  They're still working it out, but it's not good.  It's not good.  Fidel Castro.  Yeah, dead, not dead, getting better, not getting better.  We got the death watch going on.  Oh, by the way, I'm looking at a picture of the van.  It's on opianthony.com, right?  All right, you can check it out for yourself.  Well, I mean, they got the photo of him holding up a newspaper to prove that it was a recent  photograph or something.  Yeah, it seems so like they're trying so hard to make it look like he's alive, and it kind 
[00:54:00]  of looks photoshopped, the picture.  It's Castro sitting on his couch with an Adidas little jogging shirt on.  Very nice.  And he's got a copy of some Cuban periodical in his hand that's dated August 13th.  Like, you know how they would take a picture of a hostage, and you want to verify what date 
[00:54:30]  the picture was taken?  You hold up a newspaper?  Like, that's what he's doing.  You know what?  I bet you this picture was taken years ago.  Yeah.  And then they were just waiting for this day where they're going to have to prove he's  still alive.  And like you said, just photoshopped the latest paper in his hands.  Paper into his hands.  He looks too healthy there.  They're saying he's on his deathbed.  Saying he really, really took the surgery very badly.  But he looks fine.  Like, he's ready to watch football or something on his couch. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, wouldn't he have some IVs in him or something?  A little drip?  He doesn't look frail or anything, but he's hinting at bad news on the way.  As far as he's concerned.  Well, he is, or, you know...  Are the people writing for him at this point?  His cronies.  I think they want to slowly figure out how Fidel should die.  Like, if he's dead already, they've got to figure out how to tell the people, like,  he died heroically or something. 
[00:55:30]  Or slowly get people in place, get things in order so that there isn't any chaos when  they say he's dead.  It's all about letting...  It's like people are going to see this other guy, Raul, as the boss for a while.  Right.  So you have to see him as the boss...  You've got to see him do some stuff.  ...for a month.  And then all of a sudden when Fidel dies, oh, okay, well, he's the guy then.  He's the guy that's in.  We've seen him do a couple of things.  That's what they do.  Fidel is on ice somewhere.  You think he's dead?  Yeah, I think Fidel's dead. 
[00:56:00]  I don't think so.  I think he's dead.  You really think he's dead?  This picture looks too healthy.  If not on death's door, like imminent death.  But I think he's dead.  And they're just kind of holding him there.  They just have him on ice.  This old picture, they're like, hey, latest technology, we'll get Cage to Photoshop something  in his hands.  Cage, Photoshop Fidel.  Why is Jimmy Norton's head on it?  And he is having relations with a chicken.  Why does Fidel have wow sticker? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, here's some pictures on TV of him with, who the hell is that?  The guy from South America.  I don't know.  South America.  That leader that we hate.  Was he from the beginning of Argentina?  Yeah.  Is he Argentina?  Yeah.  The hell's his name?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr. Pescolini?  Here comes, we just wait.  We just wait for a pal talk.  President of Argentina.  The president.  El Presidente, they call him. 
[00:57:00]  Eric Nagel?  Valdez?  No.  He's the guy that...  Nestor?  Ricky Martin?  Kirshner?  No, it's Argentina.  You people are as dumb as we are.  Come on, you dopes.  Help us out.  We don't want to look this up.  Chavez.  Chavez, yeah, from Venezuela.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Not Argentina.  Venezuela.  Oh, Venezuela.  I told you.  It's all the same to me down there.  I just know about the Falkland Islands.  Those are in South America, I believe.  I don't know.  They're right by Puerto Rico. 
[00:57:30]  All right, let's go to...  Puerto Rico.  Let's go to Matt in Kansas.  Matt.  Yeah.  Let's go, Matt.  Hi.  Hey, I saw Rich Voss Friday night in Kansas City.  I heard there was a humdinger of a show, man.  Yeah.  He had some hecklers in the front row.  The owner of the club came down to tell him to shut the hell up.  The guy was on his cell phone, turns around, punches Craig Glazier in the face, knocks his  glasses off.  You punch it?  Oh, the owner in the face?  Yeah, he tells the story very badly. 
[00:58:00]  Rich tells the story great.  Yeah, go to Wack Bag.  I believe the story's up on Wack Bag.  Like, uh, Rich posted the whole story.  The story's up there.  The story's up there.  Sanford and Simes, was it?  Yeah.  But you saw this for yourself there, Matt.  Excuse me?  You saw the fight?  Yes.  Our only eyewitness is a dummy.  Yeah.  Was it like, uh, an old-fashioned barroom brawl?  It absolutely was.  That's what...  I learned one thing from Rich Voss.  Uh-huh.  You can't punch a guy in the back, but you can kick him in the back.  Voss kicked him? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Apparently, Voss kicked the guy in the back of the head because he was, uh, he was beating  on the owner.  So Rich kind of kicked him in the back.  Rich went into kung fu mode?  Rich went back up on stage and started plugging his CDs, Will Be For Sale, out front.  While they're fighting?  Yeah.  So why was the guy...  Was the guy just hated Voss, or was he trying to be part of the show?  No, it was, uh, four guys at a table.  Okay.  Maybe more.  Right.  They're talking on a cell phone.  They were just being very loud, drunk, and obnoxious. 
[00:59:00]  They wouldn't shut up.  Bonnie was on stage at the time.  Rich was going to leave.  And then, uh, he heard, like, Bonnie dealing with some hecklers, so he figured he'd stick  around.  Uh, Bonnie dealt with them as best she could.  Then Rich got back on stage because he wanted to give these guys a shot.  Well, how was Bonnie on after Rich?  I don't know.  But Rich got back up there, I guess, for something.  Was he hosting?  Probably Rich was hosting his own show.  Yeah, hosting his own show.  Coming to the stage, your next comedian, Rich Voss.  I think he just really wanted to pound these guys, so he decided to go back up. 
[00:59:30]  Well, let's get Voss on the phone.  Yeah, get Rich.  Because, uh, then these guys wouldn't shut up.  The owner sat behind him.  So, uh, Rich was tearing into him really bad.  And, uh, the guy started getting a little agitated.  One guy then gets another call from his cell phone and starts talking real loud.  And the whole crowd is, is upset with the whole situation.  So the owner just leans over and goes, shut that off and shut up or you're getting thrown  out.  And this is after he's told him nicely a few times.  The guy turns around and says, who the F are you? 
[01:00:00]  He goes, I'm the F an owner.  And then the guy takes a shot at him, at the owner.  And then all hell broke loose.  People in the audience came up to help.  Rich is kicking the guy.  Oh, so the audience jumped in?  Yeah, because it was four big guys, uh, big drunk guys just, you know, windmilling.  So the crowd jumped in.  So it was like an old time brawl.  Did he get really hurt or no?  Uh, I don't know.  I don't think Rich got hurt.  This is hard to read on this screen, but I got it in Rich's words.  Paul, I can print it out for you. 
[01:00:30]  No, keep it like that.  Uh, Bonnie and I are playing a club in Kansas called, uh, Stanford and Sons.  On Wednesday and Thursday, they have a $15 ticket price, which includes all the beer you  could drink.  So you could imagine how rowdy the crowds were.  But still, it was manageable and even kind of fun.  Still, Bonnie and I were looking forward to the more structured weekend shows.  Friday first show was great.  We both killed and the audience was really fun.  A couple of reporters from the Kansas City, uh, star showed up to interview us for last  comic standing four since Chris Porter is one of their own. 
[01:01:00]  They decided to stay for the second show because they came late and missed Bonnie.  I was going to go to the hotel for 20 minutes till it was time for me to go on.  But as I'm leaving, I can hear Bonnie trashing some people in the front row.  I decide to stay in case there's going to be trouble.  It's an old Bruno San Martino looking dude.  He spelled that.  Of course.  Horrifically wrong.  He means well.  Uh, dude wrestler with a trashy, uh, with a trashy blonde who's one of the most obnoxious  C's I've ever encountered.  They are with four other people, including two guys who are over six foot tall and look 
[01:01:30]  like hillbillies.  They're all super drunk, tweaking on coke, and it's Bruno's, uh, and it's Bruno's birthday  and he just got out of prison.  Oh my God.  Great to have in the crowd, huh?  This is all one paragraph.  They're all, they're out of control and they won't shut up while Bonnie is on and even use  cell phones and high five.  The owner has asked them to be quiet like three times and it does no good.  Bonnie continues trashing them, but it doesn't shut them and she ends up ignoring them and  finishing her set.  I go on and trash them intermittently while doing my show. 
[01:02:00]  They're still being horrible, but I'm handling it and it's going well until I turn and start  to really trash them.  The owner comes and sits behind them.  I don't want him to do anything because they only have about 15 minutes left and there's  no point.  Then the Bruno guy gets on his cell phone and the owner jumps up and yells at him to get  the F off.  The guy turns to the owner and says, who the F are you?  And the owner says, the F-ing owner.  And the Bruno guy retaliates by punching the owner in the face.  Then all hell breaks loose.  The other two hillbilly guys start throwing punches. 
[01:02:30]  Punches.  The owner's friends, brother, and bouncer jump in and half the audience.  It's like a bar brawl out of an old Western.  Tables are being broken.  Bottles are flying.  I jump in and try to grab people off the owner.  I kick the Bruno guy in the back and he goes flying.  The whole time, the only thing going through my head is I'm going to be able to sell DVDs  now.  They finally get the group out of the showroom and the cops come.  The writers are busy taking notes and getting quotes from people.  I doubt this story will be about Last Comic Standing. 
[01:03:00]  I get back on stage and do another 45 minutes and sell 12 DVDs.  That dummy after a brawl only sold 12 DVDs?  Isn't that correct?  I would like to cut his head off.  And then he writes, comedy is hard.  Boss.  Dude, is that for us?  Yeah.  What's going on?  You only sold 12 DVDs after an old West brawl?  First of all, this is a very, very poor area.  Oh, okay.  Very poor.  You know, the first show was like 200 people and I killed and I sold like two. 
[01:03:30]  I mean, these are poor people.  They're either poor or smart.  They have good taste, but they're poor.  What's that?  Nothing.  Continue.  So, oh, you read the post.  We just read the whole thing.  What can you add to it, boss?  We're way more awake than you right now.  Okay.  Well, I mean, it was crazy.  It was like I've never seen it.  You know, I've been doing comedy a long time.  I've never seen anything like this.  It was crazy.  The big guy, the hillbilly guy was the kind of guy that you punched and he just smiled, 
[01:04:00]  you know.  Right.  It gave him energy.  Well, when the guy punched the owner.  I wish he'd punch you.  Yeah, really.  We need some energy out of you.  Did anybody get hurt?  Wait, excuse me?  Did anybody get really messed up or no?  Well, the owner got one or two ribs cracked.  His head was bashed apart and he lost his shoes.  He got a couple ribs cracked.  You know, a black guy, you know.  It's like they were all on, you know, it just was so fast.  Like four or five cop cars came.  Okay.  You know, and there was one black guy in the place, you know. 
[01:04:30]  The cop cars came and they ran in and they got him.  Well, you know, he got like a black guy, a broken rib, you know.  And like he had, you know, there was like a six foot two bartender that didn't do anything.  Just sat behind the bar, didn't help.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, a lot of them did.  I guess, you know.  I mean, this owner, you know, he's a, this guy's been in prison too, drugs, you know.  I mean.  Nice clubs you're playing there.  No, I've heard about him. 
[01:05:00]  I heard, is he cool to comics?  What's that?  Is he cool to comedians?  Yeah, he's really cool.  He's a cool dude.  You know, he's, you know, he's got a history though.  And his brother's even scarier than him.  He came running up, you know.  Did your Kung Fu come in handy?  Yeah, I kicked it.  Like he went to, like I was just trying to grab dudes off of the owner, you know.  And then.  That's who pays rich.  So he wanted to make sure he didn't get injured and taken to the hospital.  Yeah, no, no.  I, you know, I wanted to get my cash, right.  He, and then, what do you call it? 
[01:05:30]  He went to sucker punch the owner and I kicked this one guy from behind.  You know, and then another dude came at me, but somebody sideswiped him.  Steve from Bayshore is calling you Hong Kong Jewie.  Steve is funny.  It was like an all out brawl.  It was really, it was crazy.  And then, you know, I went back on and did like 45 minutes after just to recap the thing.  And like these, there was these writers from Kansas City star there.  And I thought, I didn't even know they were there. 
[01:06:00]  You know, I thought they left after, after the, you know, body went on.  All of a sudden, you know, I look and I see this guy writing the whole story.  He was supposed to do a story on the last comic book.  That's a good story, though.  Great story.  That makes it a lot better than him just sitting there, you know, doing another comedy story.  Did it make the paper?  It's supposed to be on Wednesday's Kansas City Star, supposedly.  Jesus, news is slow in Kansas City, huh?  They have a bunch of other fights to print up.  Oh, my God.  That's why you need a Club Soda Kenny, who I imagine would have rushed in and been barbaric. 
[01:06:30]  You know, there was a couple O&A fans there.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know if they called the show.  They go, we're going to call in Monday or whatever.  Yeah, a few people.  And then they were on the message board talking about it.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I got a couple last show.  I just got out of bed telling the story that you guys already told.  Yeah, I mean, we didn't know if we can get you so.  I mean, we were trying to do that and trying to plug the fact that my tickets go on sale.  Out Wednesday for November 10th at the Hammerstein.  It's just been a busy morning.  It really has.  I hope this weekend at, what do you call it, Uncle Vinny's at Point Pleasant just doesn't  happen. 
[01:07:00]  Ew.  All right, Rich.  Uncle Vinny's at Point Pleasant?  Anyhow, look.  Mob whacking.  Did you plug that?  What's that?  Did you actually plug Uncle Vinny's at Point Pleasant?  Listen, you know.  Shut up.  Here's the thing, you know.  Sometimes I like to stay local.  It was an all-out brawl.  All right, Rich.  It was wild.  Listen, anyhow.  All right.  That's all.  You know what?  All right.  What else do you want me to say?  Nothing, because we're trying to take a break.  And you know what else happened?  Yeah, like you're going to get me. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Like we didn't see that one coming.  That was us hanging up on him.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Show right now, 866-313-FREE.  ONA, who's this?  Hi.  I'm Tony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So why'd you call?  The man on the radio said I should call.  Oh, fantastic.  Hang on.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the O.P. and Anthony Show 
[01:08:00]  at 866-313-FREE.  Okay, bye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sorry about that.  You got anything, any business you still need to take care of?  Came tearing out of the bathroom.  I had a pinch.  The O.P. and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:08:30]  Wow.  Barely made it back.  Let's go to Vinny in Middleton.  Vinny.  Middletown.  Vinny, what's up?  All the way in Middletown.  Yo, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Vinny.  Listen, regarding Castro, supposedly, my boss has a lot of family in Cuba, and one of our  family members is a nurse in the hospital he was treated in.  And supposedly, when he went into surgery about two weeks ago, he already died.  Oh, yeah?  Well, that's what Anthony's saying. 
[01:09:00]  Anthony thinks he's dead.  That's what Anthony said.  The nail right on the head.  Now, they don't know because she's also saying that her family members are higher up in the  whole government there, and she's saying that Castro's brother's a moron.  And he's just like an idiot.  You got the inside scoop, huh?  Yeah, so they don't even know what's going on.  They don't know what to do yet.  What do you do for a living, Vinny?  I'm in technology.  You're in technology.  Yeah.  That could cover anything from you make little clacking teeth. 
[01:09:30]  I think he said, I am technology.  He did say something.  I am technology.  I'm technology.  Well, where I work, that's basically it.  He's technology, but he's got the inside scoop as far as Cuba goes and Fidel Castro.  What do you do?  Come on.  Well, I do networking, voice, and data at a brokerage house.  Very cool.  Only for a couple more weeks.  I think they're going to do a weekend at Fidel's type thing.  Oh, that's great.  They're going to parade the dead body around, make him believe he's still alive.  Yeah, they'll just put him.  What they'll do is they'll just stick a broom handle up the you-know-what and put him on 
[01:10:00]  one of those quarter pony rides and just put the stick in there.  And every 10 minutes, they'll stick a quarter in.  There you go.  Thanks, Vinny.  Thanks for the inside scoop.  All right.  Take care.  All right.  I'm hoping we get pictures of Fidel water skiing or something.  Yeah.  Propped up.  All right.  Skis.  Boy George, cleaning up garbage today.  Lots of happenings in New York City.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  I just need to forward Steve a press release. 
[01:10:30]  That was in my email, so Steve must put in his email address.  There it is.  Business done.  Steve.  What happened?  What happened?  What's going on?  There's a press release.  Oh, the press release for the ONA Traveling Virus.  That's right.  Is it going to be up on opianthony.com?  Yeah, in like 30 seconds.  All right.  Very cool.  Yeah, a press release is going out this morning for the big show at the PNC Art Center there  in Jersey, August 26th. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  I guess it's a week from Saturday, if you can believe that.  A week from this coming Saturday, our second ONA Traveling Virus.  Tickets still available through ticketmaster.com.  And all the info is up on opianthony.com.  The press release is going up on opianthony.com.  It's presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Boy George, picking up garbage.  Let's go to the story.  We touched on it a little bit here.  Piles of garbage and cigarette butts are now Boy George's new audience. 
[01:11:30]  Today, the 80s.  Oh, my God.  What a stretch.  Did you hear that?  No, what'd you say?  Holy crap.  Too busy getting depressed reading the paper.  Looks like the comedy writer for the WB-11 is on vacation this week.  Piles of garbage and cigarette butts are now Boy George's new audience.  Today, the 80s pop star begins his five-day community service to clean up the streets around  lower Manhattan.  Oh, I don't know how his kids...  That's what she's...  Oh, that's the...  Okay, I thought it was a pun.  You mean she's saying that they're like... 
[01:12:00]  That's like his new audience.  Right.  How about, because he's using one of those garbage pickup things, how about, you know,  you'd think Boy George was comfortable jamming a big stick into a butt.  There you go.  That would have been a good pun.  That would get everyone laughing today.  Yeah, that would be chuckling and elbowing their neighbors.  Garbage and cigarette butts is his new audience.  Right.  They're the only audience we've ever had.  The streets around lower Manhattan.  You never know how his kid's going to show up wearing what and what type of makeup he'll 
[01:12:30]  have.  Boy George pleaded guilty in June for filing a false burglary report.  Earlier this year, Boy George called the cops saying there was a break-in at his apartment  on 255 Center Street.  But the only thing cops found upon arrival was cocaine.  Cocaine.  Smart.  Boy George was also convicted of drug possession back in 1986.  And today, fans are hoping that as he cleans up the crusty streets, he'll clean up his  act.  Not only should he pick up the dirtiest area, you know, that's not a big deal. 
[01:13:00]  You know, people do that every day for a lot less, you know, publicity than he gets.  But maybe you should go talk to some kids and say, hey, you know, I was a popular guy.  Maybe you shouldn't do drugs, because if you do drugs, look what's going to happen to you.  You're going to be picking up drugs.  Yeah, go talk to kids.  Hi, yeah, I've been having sex with men, and I wore a dress for years, and then I did  cocaine.  Yeah.  I suggest you do the same, because I'm a millionaire.  I'm sure the schools will be begging him to show up at the end.  Yeah, we need Boy George to talk to the children. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, right.  I'll tumble for you right into your lap.  You're going to be picking up garbage.  Garbage.  Now, that fan thought that Boy George might have shown up with some makeup on, but no,  he looked a little casual today, some cargo pants, no makeup on his face.  Now, it's lucky that he showed up this morning, because a Manhattan judge said if he had not  shown up, he would have to serve jail time.  So, certainly, for the next five days, he's got a big garbage pickup work ahead of him. 
[01:14:00]  So, that is the latest from me.  We're live on the Lower East Side.  I'm Julie Chang for the Morning News.  We'll send it back to you, Patricia.  Fantastic.  That's it.  You know, if any other guy got caught with coke, what happens?  Pretty much go to jail, right?  Yeah, sure.  You know, whether it's a couple of months or something, but you go to jail.  I like how celebrities get, like, kind of an extra thing.  Why is that?  Because they cheer us up when we're sad. 
[01:14:30]  Do you know what Boy George has done for me when I've been sad?  Well, of course.  He picks me up when I'm feeling blue.  We know that.  There you go.  How do you not?  Look at this.  Who's not tapping and feeling wonderful?  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Huh?  Look at that.  Kind of nice.  I'm bursting with joy on the air.  It looks at Jim.  I know I don't seem like it because there's no angry juxtaposition.  But I'm so happy right now that I almost can't speak. 
[01:15:00]  For the new listeners, that's Jimmy's calming music that we play to calm him down with you.  When I'm feeling sad, I'm...  What is it?  You feeling the doldrums?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little melancholy.  Yeah.  All right.  And, of course, airports.  Are we back to normal in the airports?  Uh, no.  Slowly.  Slowly getting back to normal.  But normal now has a few more rules.  Well, you get to take some liquids on...  Can we bring laptops on planes and domestic flights?  I don't know.  You can.  Oh, yeah?  Absolutely.  All right.  Why the Houston? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we got the latest update.  Man, I was watching the video of them at the airports.  It's just a pain in the ass for everybody.  They're just collecting all their gels and sodas.  Chapstick.  You couldn't bring chapstick on the plane.  What is Susie going to do?  Yeah.  Remember her?  Susie's chapstick.  Of course.  I'm Susie Chaffee.  But I'm also Susie Chapstick.  Really?  Was that the way it went?  Yeah.  She was Susie Chaffee. 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  Professional skier.  Good clothes lining into a tree branch is what she needs.  Nice decapitating.  Perfectly unparched lips.  Staring dumbly up at the sky as her torso continues down the hill.  Tree bark stuck to the chapstick on her lips.  She was too busy, you know, applying.  Yeah.  She was applying on her little trip down.  It was the last trip she ever took.  Well, here we go.  Here's the latest on the airports.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  The security.  And the turrets.  High security.  With limited resources to spend on aviation security, does it make sense for everyone to undergo the same scrutiny at airport checkpoint?  No.  Well, there's no doubt that people from the Middle East are more of a terrorist suspect than the 80-year-old grandmother from Sweden.  Right.  The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee says terrorist attacks like 9-11 should motivate screening guidelines.  It was Middle Easterners, it was people of Arab descent who are Muslims, and we should keep that in mind.  I will not use the excuse of shortage of resources and just justify harassing people because of their race. 
[01:17:00]  Guilty.  Throw them in jail.  The executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations says King's approach is dangerous.  He needs a room at the old Guantanamo Inn.  King's approach is fantastic, and that guy from the council, the Arab council, kind of has to say that.  But I want to hear the Arab council.  How about this?  You comment on maybe Al-Zarqawi on the beheadings of Islamic Jihad. 
[01:17:30]  That's what you should be commenting on.  Or how about the fact that Britain goes out of their way to be nice to Muslims in their country and coddle them,  and they're just doing nothing but home-growing people who want to destroy the country.  Why don't you comment on that and stick to that, and that's what we're interested in hearing from you.  That's it.  Well, you're going to get really mad in a few seconds here.  King's approach is dangerous.  Timothy McVeigh, who's white, with a crew cut, was not suspected when he bombed the federal building in Oklahoma. 
[01:18:00]  So it takes one mistake to miss someone.  You're right.  Can you pause that for one second, please?  Here's the problem with this guy saying.  Yeah, it does take one mistake, but because you're looking at Middle Easterners more, it doesn't mean you're looking at other people.  What are they going to let some suspicious-looking white guy on the plane wearing army fatigues and putting his hands in his pockets like Napoleon?  They're going to stop him, too, stupid.  Napoleon.  But stop with the old ladies.  I know the pregnant women are going to do it, too.  I'm willing to take the chance.  Some fat old black lady being stopped while three Middle Eastern guys traipse through. 
[01:18:30]  You know what?  You know what, though?  God bless race.  God bless religion.  It's the melting pot here in New York, and that's what makes us all feel good about each other.  But the bottom line is feeling good about each other isn't going to save our lives, so racial profiling works.  And I don't even mind being the victim of racial profiling.  How about having a plane with all white people on it?  You dirty white people, get on that plane.  We don't trust you, but you should because I'm a good guy.  I care about you, and I'd like you to care about me.  Nothing wrong with feeling good. 
[01:19:00]  I don't want any problems with Islam at all, but they want problems with us, so I say profile.  Well, that does make you happy.  It makes everyone happy.  That song is so happy.  How do you not feel good with that?  My toes are still tapping.  To miss someone, and just to have a massive loss of civilian life.  Hello, exactly!  Thank you, Dirk.  We have a second clip, but Megan from Houston. 
[01:19:30]  Houston.  Houston, I'll be there this weekend.  Houston.  What's up, Megan?  Houston, what's up?  How are you doing?  Hey.  See, you guys do have female fans.  Thank you.  Yes.  I'm going to see you on Friday, Jimmy.  I'm looking forward to it.  Thank you.  At the improv.  And I've been calling the Houston press to make sure that you're going to be in it.  Do you know if you're going to be in it?  I do not know, actually, to be honest.  Well, it says you want to try to get them in the paper.  Well, it's like our village voice type thing.  Okay, yeah, the press.  I know.  Every city has like a local something-something press. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like free hippie paper.  Okay, well, what are you guys enjoying about my call?  Absolutely not.  That's funny.  I like her intention.  She's spunky.  Her execution stunk.  She knew, though.  She knew.  Of course she did.  That was funny.  Better way to profile.  Here we go.  Judging people by their nationality or ethnicity is not necessarily a good idea.  We have better ways to judge people, and that is their behavior and their background.  Rafi Ron ran security at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport.  Israeli screeners questioned passengers and watched their conduct. 
[01:20:30]  It's all about using behavioral indicators that may lead you to the level of questioning  that would help you blow up a cover story.  An approach being tried at some American airports.  Those are the tactics that we in the last year have now started to roll out in our own  procedure.  A terrorist about to blow himself up is under enormous pressure and may act strangely.  It may not be screeners alone who are looking for the signs. 
[01:21:00]  We have proven that law enforcement people and airport employees are extremely good at  detecting suspicious behavior when they are trained to do that and when they are provided  with the right tools and skills.  It's an evolution in American airport security, one that could shorten your time in security  lines.  Someday.  I'm distracted because they're all doing the story on Boy George.  Yeah, every news.  ABC here in New York, the headline is, Jailhouse Rock.  Oh, I...  That's cool. 
[01:21:30]  But he's not in jail.  Yeah, they have one letter off.  No.  And, uh, good for the...  Tell...  Have you noticed that LL has not had one?  I mean, they've had a crash, but they don't have any problems on LL because they are animals  with screening.  They don't care.  They will drag you out and question you.  They're not politically correct with their questions.  They do, uh, hiney searches, too.  Good.  Do what you gotta do.  I'm all for that.  They're big on the hiney searches.  I volunteer for that every time I go through line.  Make sure you don't want to treat a little thiever, mister, whoever.  As long as you got gloves, I'm game.  Let's go to Mike in San Antonio. 
[01:22:00]  Mike?  Yes, sir.  Mike Woods on Fox.  Are we getting this?  I'm sorry.  Someone's taping Fox.  He's really talking.  Look at that thin head.  He looks like The Rock, and yet he looks nothing like The Rock.  I don't know how he pulls it off.  Why are we obsessed with him?  How can we not be?  He's everything we want to be.  We're obsessed about the dumbest things on this show.  Sure.  Uh, Mike, what's up?  Yeah, um, look.  I'm a Palestinian Muslim.  Um, that lives in the United States. 
[01:22:30]  Look, I don't want to ruinize every time I get on an airplane because of where I'm from.  Look, I understand that it was the people, you know, that they're Middle Easterners and stuff.  But that's not my damn fault.  It's not your fault, but you have to now pay for the crimes of people that are of the same descent as you.  Why?  Why?  Because that's how it is.  Here's the bottom.  I know what you're saying, dude.  You didn't do anything wrong.  But getting on a plane, there's a screening process.  Let me ask you a question.  As a passenger on a plane, can you honestly say that you'll look at, like, say, some 55-year-old Asian grandmother and feel the same apprehension or tension about what she might do on the flight as you would, say, two Arabic males? 
[01:23:00]  I'm Middle Eastern guys.  Come on.  Be honest, dude.  Okay.  Okay.  I understand also where you're coming from.  But, see, it's about, you know, me personally.  I don't give a look.  And I heard you a bunch of times saying that Muslims should stand up and apologize for, or, you know. 
[01:23:30]  No, not apologize.  They didn't do anything wrong.  No, you guys got to eat your own, though.  Speak out against it.  You got to eat your own, man.  You got to get some leaders in there to take care of this situation or at least attempt to.  Okay.  Look, I don't care what Bin Laden did.  Every race needs to eat their own.  What is that?  He's saying every race needs to eat their own, meaning that people, like, when you're suffering from problems now because of things other guys have done, you know, Muslim, I think, after 9-11, didn't really stand up and say enough. 
[01:24:00]  Where's your leaders speaking out against this stuff?  I never see that, ever.  They're very safe.  You got to admit, man, like, where was all the attacks on al-Zarqawi?  Until he killed people in Jordan, a lot of Muslim leaders didn't say much about him at all.  I don't know any terrorists, so why should I stand up and speak out, you know, against them?  Dude, not you, Muslim leaders, not you.  And I'll tell you why you should stand up.  Because they are identifying themselves with Islam.  They're saying we are – we're doing this for jihad. 
[01:24:30]  It's almost like if there was white guys standing up going, we're out there killing blacks, we're out there killing Jews for white guys.  As a white guy, I would expect to get harassed walking through an airport if it was happening on planes.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah, I get what you're saying.  I'm not – I know – you're not a criminal.  I know I'm not a criminal, but look, it's being done, you know, over the top.  And it – you know –  Mike, it's just –  Over the top.  They just caught some guys all of Middle Eastern descent that were planning on blowing up 10 planes. 
[01:25:00]  How is it going over the top if we're getting results like that?  I'd rather that happen and a few of you guys be inconvenienced –  That plane would have never – that plane would have never gone through.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I would have rather you personally, sorry, be inconvenienced a bit at the airports than 10 planes go down in the ocean.  That's the world we live in today.  It's you guys.  Sorry.  You guys are the marks that have to now be looked at a little more closely, whether you're innocent, guilty, or whatever. 
[01:25:30]  It's just – it's not us that's looking at you.  You can't look at us and go, oh, look at the – people are profiling.  It's your people that are effing it up for you.  Yeah, Mike.  It just sucks to be you.  Just –  The US acts of the world that makes these people, you know –  No, it's the same.  And I heard you say the other day, what's the end game with these guys?  What's the end game with these guys?  It is to get out of the Middle East, leave us alone, and make Israel stop killing people. 
[01:26:00]  Look, I lived in Palestine.  Well, hold on.  You just said – you just said, leave us alone.  So you do in some way identify with the guys who are doing it.  You're identifying in a weird way with their cause by saying it like that.  Leave us alone.  I'm not saying you want terrorism.  Because, look, I lived in.  You never lived in, Jimmy.  No, I know.  Okay?  Look.  But I live here.  I was in the West Bank, okay, just a year ago, okay?  I was driving from one town to the other, which is like 10 minutes driving.  They stopped us at a roadblock, okay, for six freaking hours, okay? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, but when –  You know what they tell us?  You know what they tell us?  What?  What?  Turn around and go back home.  How am I not supposed to be angry about that?  Well, then how come – well, maybe if you guys – or not you guys, I'm saying your people –  would stop strapping bombs with nails and ball bearings on them and climbing into buses,  maybe they wouldn't check your cars.  If you've been occupied and land confiscated for 60 years and you have no way to defend yourself,  how would you do it?  How would you suggest they do it?  How about through diplomacy and not through religious fanaticism? 
[01:27:00]  Mike, how would you suggest they do it?  Yeah, good question, Jimmy.  Well, no.  No, no, dude.  Look.  How do you suggest –  You guys are the powerful ones.  The U.S. and Israel, you guys have the power.  We don't.  You pull out, you be the nice guys, and leave us alone.  How do you suggest – okay, let's go with – forget the Middle East.  Let's go with – on planes.  How do you suggest, and to start with profiling, that we go about this?  Do you think that Middle Eastern men should be looked at no differently than, say, older white ladies, 
[01:27:30]  older black ladies, or a mom?  People that don't fit the profile.  Looking at the plane rise and – look.  If they start solving the roots and causes of terrorism –  Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, stop.  Root and cause.  You're removing blame from the terrorists.  You're legitimizing what they're doing.  You're saying their motives are pure and clear.  Not that Bin Laden is a demagogue or a power-hungry monster.  Why can't you acknowledge that too?  That maybe Al-Zarqawi and those guys like it to be bad because if it's good, they cease  to exist.  Why is that a problem? 
[01:28:00]  Why does everybody talk about root causes like it's all Israel, it's all the United States,  instead of saying that maybe the Islamic fanatics have something to do with it as well because  with peace, their cause is no longer valid?  But, look, believe me, there's no – I'm a Muslim.  I'm a Palestinian, like I said.  There's no such thing as Muslims want to take over the world.  That's a stupid thing.  I didn't say that in the world.  No such thing?  I just want to punch the TV.  I don't want to punch the stupid radio.  We don't want to take over the stupid world.  Dude, Hamas now has Palestine. 
[01:28:30]  They have – Hamas now has it, right?  So what are they doing?  They sanction the kidnapping of a soldier.  What type of – what type of idiocy is that?  Okay.  Has anybody ever mentioned that Israel is holding more than a thousand Lebanese prisoners without  trial and that they are violating Lebanese airspace on a daily basis?  Dude, dude.  Not – I'm not talking about Hezbollah.  I'm not talking about Lebanon.  I'm talking about Hamas.  What about Hamas?  They sanction – I'm talking about the – 
[01:29:00]  Okay, the people in Gaza are living in a virtual prison, okay?  They are just – and on a daily basis they do these targeted assassinations where they  go up on – before the soldiers were kidnapped, they will go up and if they think somebody's  with a – with a Hamas militant, okay, they just bomb them in their cars, how are you not  supposed to retaliate to that?  Has Hamas – Hamas doesn't really seem to want diplomacy.  Haven't they screamed that they'll never accept Israel and they want to abandon Israel?  I mean, come on, dude.  Yeah.  They don't seem, like, too willing to negotiate. 
[01:29:30]  Look, open the borders to – okay, if Palestinians today are offered to be part of the Israeli  community where they're treated just as good as the Jews are, okay, just as good and be  able to vote and be able to be, you know, normal citizens, not second-class pieces of crap,  there will not be one attack.  Like, I guarantee you –  Oh, really?  There wouldn't be one bus blowing up or one – yeah.  When you're a prisoner in your own country, in your own homeland where you were born, when 
[01:30:00]  your father was – where your father was born and your grandfather was born, that's  how you get people to act the way they do.  Do you understand?  We don't have F-16s and tanks and all that stuff because if we did, we would use that instead  of strapping bombs on ourselves and blowing ourselves up.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  That's the only way it means that they can.  If Hezbollah could target Israeli soldiers, they wouldn't target civilians.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  I understand why they do suicide bombings instead of go out to soldiers. 
[01:30:30]  We've got to take a break, man.  We're not – but – all right.  That's what you think.  I don't think any minds are being changed here on the Opie and Anthony show as they're  just blowing each other up.  I don't think on the Opie and Anthony – but we have an open forum for discussion.  I mean, I don't agree, but –  We're just trying to do fart jokes.  I thought halfway through he was going to say something like, nah, I'm kidding.  I love the Jews.  Look, look.  You know how –  We've got to take a break.  Mike, do you like the show?  We're just running late.  I listen to you guys all the time.  Hey, Jimmy, I'm going to come to Houston and see you.  I'm here.  Oh, no. 
[01:31:00]  I don't know if I like that or not.  Hey, Jimmy, Mike, change his opinion.  Hold on a minute.  Nice, fella.  He's right.  What are you going to do?  Are the Zionists causing problems in Mike?  There he is.  Mike, Jimmy's on your side.  Just remember that.  Jesus.  Let's go to –  That's all he's got to do.  Let's go to Chad in Ohio.  Chad.  Hey, what's happening, boys?  Make it fast.  We've got to take a quick break.  Hey, they were interviewing Dennis Leary here a couple days ago about a lot of this stuff going on and him traveling and what his opinion was.  And it kind of took him back like, you know, why do I care? 
[01:31:30]  But he said, there's only two things I care I hate in this whole world.  He said, that's racial profiling and Arabs on my flight.  And, man, it was just – the reporter had no idea what to do.  That's very funny.  He kind of looked at the camera, man.  Good for him.  It was great.  All right.  Very good.  God forbid the reporter would have anything to say of human interest.  Yeah.  Just a dumb reader.  I bet Chad put it across just like Leary did, too, with the way he just said that.  I mean, Chad's delivery with Stella, actually.  I almost said thanks for calling Dennis. 
[01:32:00]  You pizzazzless zilch.  We'll step aside and continue.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  New York's sultry skies and ardent airwaves lends itself admirably to its own form of audio entertainment.  From the supreme skyscrapers to the sanguinary savages running the detestable delis on every splendiferous street corner,  the city is being infected with the outstanding O&A virus.  I dare you to listen to this radio gold and not get infected. 
[01:32:30]  Let me first introduce to you the always gregarious Greg Opie Hugh.  What about me?  What about me?  I love people.  We're just shock-shocks.  Ha ha ha!  The amazingly adept Anthony Comia.  We're good guys.  Oh, they're ripping me off.  We suck.  And the smashing staffer, the loquacious little Jimmy Norton. 
[01:33:00]  Welcome aboard.  All over to the shoulder.  It gets good.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Logan Anthony!  Space Hog.  You remember the name.  Absolutely.  Back in the old days.  Space Hog.  In the meantime, I'm on the only station that really rocks.  Ha ha ha!  Are you the only station that really rocks, you dopes? 
[01:33:30]  Only station that...  We were good boys, though.  We sold that line for that radio station.  The only station that really rocks.  And then you go around your dial and everyone's playing Metallica and God Smack.  Hey, other people seem to be rocking.  I thought they were playing the faggy music.  Same freaking music.  But we're the only station doing it.  What?  But you said. 
[01:34:00]  What?  But you said.  Radio's so stupid.  You're listening to the home of rock and roll.  We're your home for rock and roll.  Like rock and roll goes there after work.  Right.  And gets dinner and sleeps and wakes up and goes...  Back to rocking.  You know how stupid that is?  I worked for three homes of rock and roll.  Three of them.  In my career.  How many boars and uninteresting people were on radio?  It's amazing how this...  Yeah, they just keep doing the same stuff. 
[01:34:30]  Who's still doing Two for Tuesday?  Hitting the post.  That stinks.  I bet you we're on a station that is a home of rock and roll.  Of course we are.  I'm sure.  And stations that do two for...  I'm sorry.  Whatever.  I will bet this.  We're on at least...  Well, we should find out.  Uh-huh.  I guarantee we're on at least one station named after an animal.  An animal?  Like the fox?  The fox?  The eagle or...  The alley cat.  What? 
[01:35:00]  The cougar.  The Muslim.  Oh.  Sorry.  Wow.  Don't blow me up.  Don't blow me up.  Hey, is Sid in town?  I don't know.  Did you get my email?  Yes.  We're on the wolf.  All right.  We're on the wolf.  That's right.  New London, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  We're on the wolf.  Any other animals we're on?  What the hell does the wolf mean?  That's the station that's out of Mohegan.  Albuquerque is the buzzard.  We're on the buzzard. 
[01:35:30]  The buzzard.  I'm sure we did liners for Albuquerque already.  This is Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to us on the buzzard.  Yeah, our new London station is right out of Mohegan, son.  So, like, I could guarantee that whatever they are paying us, I will lose it to them at some point.  Yeah, it's a wash.  It's a wash.  That station knows they're breaking even with us.  I go there and it's over, Johnny.  Hey, our good pal, Don Imus, a little while ago, we're competing against him, I guess, in New York, but he praises us. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, Imus, we're going to kick your ass.  But he praises us all the time.  Love, Don.  But we're going to kick your ass.  Yeah.  Your time is over, sir.  Well, the ratings are in and the boys are beating us.  So, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, f*** them.  Not talking about them anymore.  Well, he had some nice things to say about the show a little while ago on MSNBC.  It's nice of him.  I mean, when I think about sports, I think about ESPN anyway. 
[01:36:30]  Once again, you have your finger on the pulse.  You're absolutely right about that.  I mean, Sunday Night Football has not been the same in a long time.  They're putting it on cable now.  It's going to be on ESPN this year.  The big package is Sunday Night Football, which is on MSNBC.  And totally unrelated news, Opie and Anthony are on 96.3 in Albuquerque in the afternoon.  Uh-huh.  Wait, we were just talking about Albuquerque.  Yeah.  Oh, and he spends his summers in Albuquerque, right? 
[01:37:00]  Uh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Let's see what this is about.  Rodding all horses.  Point three in Albuquerque in the afternoon.  Uh-huh.  Have you heard them?  Oh, man, they are a scream.  You ever heard them?  Oh, man, you're missing some leads.  Oh, man, they are mean.  Got to get with it.  That's some funny dudes.  My boys, O and A.  And, uh, don't show their pictures.  That's because people are not going to watch.  Both of you kind of cute, but. 
[01:37:30]  Anthony looks like a terrorist.  Yeah, Andy, yeah.  See, I get profiled on the airplanes.  Anthony.  And I'm a stupid Italian.  Back in the day, man.  I really looks like a terrorist.  Back in the day when Ant and I first met and started doing radio together,  not only did he look like a terrorist way more than he does today.  He used to drive around in a white, unmarked van.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Used to get stopped a lot.  So Ant understands being profiled, and he's still cool with it.  Get profiled? 
[01:38:00]  They pull me aside at the airports.  Oh, here's the line.  Andy looks like a terrorist.  Yeah, Andy, yeah.  But they wouldn't want Andy on an airplane.  Yeah, hell, Andy.  He looks like a shoe bobber.  It's just a guest for Antifed's son.  Anyway.  Oh, what?  Anything else is for?  Not that dark.  He just beats you up.  I know.  I beat him up, though.  He just beats you up.  You're going to take that?  Hey, hey.  Are you going to take that, Henry?  Yeah.  You've got to give Imus his licks. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  You can get some in.  What am I going to do?  Get upset?  It's cool that he's promoting us.  He's beat up the guy a lot.  It's very cool he's promoting us.  I think Imus is very funny.  He's my father, so.  Yeah, you two really do look, when they put the picture of you against him.  Holy crap.  Don't say we look alike.  No.  He looks like an old version of you.  All right.  I'll accept that.  Well, what did you think I was going to say?  You look 80?  That's what I was getting.  Yeah, I was getting a little worried there.  Are you insane?  I thought you were ready to say you guys look alike. 
[01:39:00]  I'm like, we look like we can maybe be related.  That's what I was saying.  I thought that went without saying.  And I'm being polite.  He looks more like he could be my grandfather.  Great grandfather.  That's why he wears the cowboy hat and stuff.  I think he got brought back by Doc in Back to the Future 3.  He's actually a real cowboy from the oldie days.  All right.  Let's go.  Oh, look at this.  Lady Di. 
[01:39:30]  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  How you doing, hon?  What's up, Lady Di?  Hon.  How's it going?  Lady Di is an old friend of the show.  Very old because we don't give a crap about her anymore.  She's a raging alcoholic that was homeless and given hand jobs and other things to hobos  on the train track behind a grocery store.  Yeah.  She went homeless.  She actually had a job at Budweiser.  She lost her job.  And in that, it went the downcline of Lady Di. 
[01:40:00]  She started drinking heavily, got drunk, lost her son.  Custody of her son had to be given to her father.  She then lost her house, lost everything.  She was living at a train station platform doing favors for homeless guys and alcohol  at the train station.  And now we finally talked her into going to rehab.  She ended up in rehab somehow.  And we haven't heard from her since.  This is the first time we're hearing from her.  Last we heard, she was homeless, filthy. 
[01:40:30]  She came in here.  She stunk like a homeless person.  She was drunk.  She had corpse hands.  Corpse hands.  Dirt of just filthy.  And Lady Di, what are you doing now?  Right now, I...  Who cares?  That's her first phone call in months to us.  We're real supportive.  Not to put her back in the bottle she belongs in. 
[01:41:00]  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Hi.  Who's this?  Hi.  Yeah.  Who is this?  Brandon from Boston, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  What do you got, man?  Well, I wanted to just say that I'm glad you guys are back on in Boston against, you  know, Gay Mantown and David Lee Roth.  It's finally something good to listen to.  We're up against David Lee Roth?  No, you know what I mean. 
[01:41:30]  You know, exactly.  Didn't we take over for David Lee Roth?  Yes.  Yes, yes.  We all know.  And we compete against, uh, Mantown.  Mantown.  Yes, of course.  Where men hang out.  Right, yeah.  Good old Mantown.  Manly things together.  That's not really what I called.  I wanted to tell you because I've...  I've listened to the show for a while and, like, all the midget sightings are, like,  okay, but, like, I've got, like, I think the best midget sighting ever.  All right, let's go.  All right.  I was at...  I went to a wedding at, uh, the Sheridan, which, you know, nice, nice place.  And, uh, I'm out of the cocktail hour. 
[01:42:00]  You know, we're all starting to get lit up and everything like that, open bar, which  is always a pleasure.  Um, and in walks this midget, and I'm walking, watching him walk across, and then, like,  there's a revolving door, so these, like, five or six of them just keep piling in.  It's like the wheel of midgets.  Like, I end up finding out later that there's a midget convention in one of the rooms, right  next door.  In one of the rooms.  A midget convention in one room.  In one room.  That's great.  In one suite on the 13th floor.  Yes.  Right next to where this, where this wedding was, happened was there was a Little People 
[01:42:30]  of America convention.  And, uh, there was, like, you know, one of every shape and size and, you know, all different  kinds of stuff.  There was, like, little midget kids with, like, uh, shrunken heads, and they were hanging  off the luggage racks like little monkeys.  You hit a midget jackpot.  I did.  I did hit a midget jackpot.  There was a quarter of midget.  Oh, he's so nervous.  You hear him?  Yeah, yeah.  I watched the midget conventions on that show.  I hope they bring it back, Little People, Big World.  And they always show them going to conventions.  And you got, like, you got, like, the cowboy midget.  You got the business, uh, midget. 
[01:43:00]  You got the punk rock midget.  You got the rocker.  You got the gay midget.  They all just, like.  Mullet midget.  They all just, like, dress up in different costumes and they become, uh, different people.  Exactly.  You got the scooter midgets that bite you on the ankles as you're trying to walk by.  But they kind of look the same.  Yeah.  They got that same, like, head and hairdo.  Right.  Right, right.  So, by the end of the wedding, they, the midgets had crashed the reception.  They had crashed the reception.  They were on the tables dancing around.  They were not on the tables. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, I swear.  I swear.  They were on the tables.  They were getting belligerent.  I think one was, like, break dancing on the floor.  It was, like, there's wedding.  Nothing funny, by the way.  And a break dancing midget.  Yeah.  Some of those little legs trying to spin him around on his flat head.  It's like, you know, if a normal person was laying on the ground and trying, and we're  trying to run on the ground, you know, with their legs around, that's, you know.  No, I don't.  Wow, this has been a terrific midget sighting.  Yeah.  You were right.  This one could be the best one ever.  I was doubting you in the beginning, but, man, you brought it all around, and it's just 
[01:44:00]  terrific.  Uh, Lady Di.  Hi.  Oh, we must have gotten cut off.  Sorry about that, Lady Di.  What's up?  Well, everyone knows your history now.  So, um.  What's going on with you guys?  No, no.  We're doing a radio show.  We're doing a show.  I thought you were doing a radio show.  What do you think's going on with us?  If you want to do anything that might interest somebody, describe what happened from the 
[01:44:30]  time you were a smelly homeless woman till now.  Well, I got myself back together again.  How?  I got a job.  I got a job.  Did you go through?  Hey, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Rehab.  Me.  How did the rehab go, and how is your, um, alcoholism?  Well, I, I, I cut back on my drinking drastically.  Cut back.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.  I'm going to have to tell you something.  Cut back, people.  I'm going to have to tell you something.  Okay, watch.  Marion saw the movie World Trade Center, okay? 
[01:45:00]  She went and she saw the movie.  Was there a wow sticker in it?  Yes, there was.  Oh, really?  Yes, there was.  Hey, hey, dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy, listen to me.  What?  What happened?  We're not going to get breaking news from you, Lady Di.  You were supposed to go to rehab, and then we heard you left rehab.  Where did you hear that from?  We just heard it stupid.  We know it happened.  You, you got dropped off in rehab.  You were supposed to stay and, and get detoxed and everything, and you ended up leaving. 
[01:45:30]  Is this true or not?  We did not end up leaving.  What happened was they let me go.  Here's the lies.  By the way, I didn't say this to the new listeners.  Shut up, idiot.  To the new listeners that are just getting this program, Lady Di is also a compulsive liar.  And I mean that in every sense of the word.  You are the most compulsive liar ever.  Yes, you are.  So you lie about everything. 
[01:46:00]  You left rehab.  You left rehab.  How did you now?  You say you're not homeless anymore?  I am not homeless anymore.  So where are you living?  I'm living right now in Elizabeth.  What kind of place?  I don't care.  I mean, what is it?  I don't care what town.  What is the setup?  Is it a halfway house?  Is it someone's house?  Are you paying rent?  Do you have a job?  It's somebody's place, and I'm paying him rent.  You're paying him rent.  With what?  How do you, where, where, you got a job?  I have a job.  Where?  Where?  What are you doing? 
[01:46:30]  What do you do?  Wait, wait, hold on one second.  I work in a warehouse, but I'm not going to tell you where I work at.  That's fine.  What are you doing in the warehouse?  What are you doing in the warehouse?  What do I do in the warehouse?  Get on the knees for the fellas.  Here's what she does also.  Notice these little things.  We got to give, we got to clue people into what Lady Di is all about.  And she'll just keep babbling.  Whenever we ask her a question, she will answer with the same question we just asked to give  her more time to think out the lie.  So we go, what warehouse?  What warehouse?  Like, it's her, it's a total, it's textbook liar. 
[01:47:00]  How many times have people sat on your back thinking you were the forklift?  We all have a Lady Di in our lives and we just need to say goodbye to them.  And I know how to get on a forklift, but I can't get on a forklift right now because  I'm a temp over there.  You're a temp.  That's so.  You're a temp at a warehouse.  Yes, I am a temp at a warehouse.  And that affords you an apartment with someone that you're living with.  Who is this, a guy?  None of your business. 
[01:47:30]  It's a man, right?  It's none of our business.  You called our radio show.  You're calling to tell us.  It's a guy.  You're living with a guy.  Where did you hook up with this guy?  I know him.  Where do you know him from?  How long have you known him?  Give people your story.  I know him a couple of years.  A couple of years.  Lady Di went from drinking 36 beers a day to 30 and she thinks she's making progress.  Hold on one second.  Hold on one second.  Before you get anything wrong, I want that taken off the website. 
[01:48:00]  What?  I want that taken off the website about me being homeless.  Too bad.  Too bad.  Why?  You were.  Yeah, well, that's the past.  We got a guy that's very sympathetic to Lady Di.  I can't believe these people actually come out of the woodwork and really are feeling for someone like Lady Di.  Henry, what's up?  For the new listeners, this is a fat slut, okay?  Whose husband killed himself because he couldn't deal with the fact he was such a fat, drunken pig. 
[01:48:30]  So for the new listeners, shut your mouth, you stupid bitch.  Why do you keep calling?  Why?  You understand what they do to you?  Stop calling, stupid.  So for all the new listeners, you're listening to a fat, drunken, homeless, a lot to put...  Who's this, Frenchie?  What?  Who's that, Frenchie?  Was that Frenchie or was that Anthony?  I'm trying...  Oh my God, like I've ever done a French guy accent, excuse me.  It's Henry.  Not that I haven't done a French guy. 
[01:49:00]  Lady Di, yeah, we forgot to also tell the new listeners.  There's so much that I just keep forgetting.  That Lady Di's husband was so happy in his marriage with Lady Di that he stepped in front of a train in New Jersey and was plowed over and killed by it.  And it was better.  Actually, it reminded him of the first time Lady Di came running at him to hug him.  Kiss the train.  Stop with that already.  This is a man who kissed the train rather than kiss you in the mouth. 
[01:49:30]  Okay?  And for the new listeners, she has a son who she's not allowed to see because she's an unfortunate mother as well.  Shut your mouth, stupid.  This isn't Frenchie, you stupid.  See?  I don't have words on this.  Thank you very much.  Lady Di, do you have custody of your kid now?  Is he living with you?  I'm not going to answer that.  That means no.  The answer is no, because the answer is no, you're a drunken slut. 
[01:50:00]  Stop already.  Why won't you answer it, Lady Di?  Yeah.  The answer is my son still loves me, everything's funny.  Ew.  That means no.  Well, it's the truth.  He's embarrassed by you.  You're a self-indulgent horse's ass who still drinks.  Why should he still love you?  You're giving him nothing.  Yeah, you didn't realize alcohol has destroyed your life, so you're just cutting back.  Hey, Lady Di, because I know you don't get to talk to your son anymore.  Why don't you use our radio show to give a special message from Mommy? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  What would Mommy say if your boy was right here?  I would say, Peter, I love you.  Wait, say it.  I swear to God.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Lady Di, your phone's cracked out, so say it again.  We'll give you like 30 seconds to speak to you.  Go ahead.  Your son you haven't talked to in a while.  Peter, I love you, and I want to be with you.  And one of these days, everything is going to, you know, fall back together again, and we're going to get a place to stay, and that's it. 
[01:51:00]  Everybody's laughing.  Everybody's laughing.  What's the truth?  You're an emotional hack.  I'm 16 years old.  Shut up.  That was a hack response.  Oh, I know.  Everything's going to be okay.  We're going to be okay.  We're going to be you vague idiots.  Early to bed.  Early to rise.  It's like Alice.  We're going to go, I'm going to sling hash.  There's a new lush in town, and she's looking drunk.  There's a pickled fat face. 
[01:51:30]  You know, everything on you is fat but your ass.  How did you manage that?  You know, sometimes you have to take baby steps before you take it.  Baby steps.  You're plummeting backwards.  Baby steps.  Baby steps.  Shut up.  Your fat body's rolling down the hill backwards.  The only thing you have in common with a baby is that you lay there and soil yourself.  You sot.  You drunken sot.  That's right.  He called you a sot.  Look it up.  Lady Di, why haven't you stopped drinking completely? 
[01:52:00]  Why not?  Like I told you, I cut back on my drinking.  Ugh.  Don't you realize you're the type of person that can't?  I don't drink like every day.  Yeah, just keep doing it.  Just keep doing it selfish.  Keep doing it.  A long time ago.  Selfish.  Forget the kid.  It's all about you.  Cry.  Forget the kid.  His whole life is passing you by.  Cry.  Stupid.  Yep.  Keep drinking.  Cry.  How many years are going to go by?  How many years of a golden years of your boy are you going to miss growing up because  of the bottle?  His mother was a homeless bum. 
[01:52:30]  That's got to be great for a kid in high school.  How's your mom?  Oh, she's buying a train tracks.  No.  Behind some weeds on a mattress.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Let me straight up.  You're a bum.  Let me straight up.  No, no.  Let me straight up.  The applicant.  What's that?  Yeah.  First of all, that was a bunch of stories.  Shut up, bum.  Are you saying that was malarkey?  Listen to me.  I'm listening, bum.  Go ahead.  Okay, Jim.  Listen to me.  Go ahead, you mug.  That was a bunch of stories.  Really?  Stories.  Okay.  In other words.  Stories.  We saw the mattress you were banging guys on. 
[01:53:00]  Someone went out with a video camera and documented you and a night in the life of Lady Di.  You were panhandling.  You were talking.  You were drunk, talking about giving favors to some of the other homeless gentlemen.  Laughing.  Having their company on filthy mattresses under the train platform.  You were carrying on like a bum.  It was an act.  Hey, hey, hey, drink, drink.  Blah, blah, blah.  Hey, hey.  Disgusting. 
[01:53:30]  No, no.  Okay.  Well, I have a friend over here.  Her name is Kathy.  Yeah.  And she wants to talk to you.  Put that whore on the phone.  No, no, no.  Who is Kathy?  Your new sidekick?  Tell them.  It was a bunch of stories.  Tell them.  Why are you coaching her, you fat liar?  We can hear you.  Oh, my God.  What a dumb liar.  You're not talking in an instant message.  This is real people talk.  Tell them.  Kathy.  Yeah.  Hi, Kathy. 
[01:54:00]  Hi.  What do you have to say, whore?  What are you all about?  Well, she told me to tell you it was a bunch of stories.  How do you feel about that, though, honestly?  Well, she is doing good.  She has a place to stay.  Tell her to stop whispering.  How many beers does Lady Di drink a day, whore?  How many beers a day?  Just give her a number.  She can't hear us.  Whore, how many drinks does Lady Di do a day?  Uh, I don't know.  About.  More than ten, whore? 
[01:54:30]  Ballpark.  About that.  But she does drink every day.  About that.  Every day, a little cocktail, right?  Well, yeah, sort of.  Yeah.  See?  What's your poison, whore?  What's your story?  Like, how do you know Lady Di?  What do they have to get the story straight?  Of course they do.  Kathy, just tell her to shut up and tell the truth.  I met her on the street.  Oh, so you were also homeless? 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  And the house that you're living in now is like a house for a bunch of homeless people?  No, it's like a rooming house.  It's a rooming house.  Oh, that's wonderful.  So she's living in a place where, like, the neon sign says bar and flashes at night.  What's your addiction there?  Yeah, what do you like?  What's your poison?  What do I like?  Yeah, what do you like?  Yeah, what do you like?  Heroin, crack, or booze?  What?  They got us, like. 
[01:55:30]  Well, uh.  Oh, well, I drink a little bit.  Oh, you drink a little lot.  All right.  All right, we're done with you two.  Yeah, you're not telling the truth, Kathy.  Why are you letting her coach you?  We all know what she did.  She's a drunk.  We know it.  She's calling to say she's doing better because she's in a halfway house in between BJ's.  Does she drink at least a six-pack a day?  About that.  About that.  Hey, did you ever accept money for sexual favors? 
[01:56:00]  Did I?  Yes.  Well, yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  What do you look like?  Yeah, describe yourself, please.  Well, long brown hair, brown eyes.  Uh-oh.  5'7".  All the safe stuff.  How much do you weigh?  How many teeth you got left?  All of them.  How much do you weigh?  All of my teeth I have.  How much do you weigh?  Around 115.  Yeah.  All right.  Around 115.  Crack whore.  Yeah.  You like the crack, too. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  That's great.  Lady Di living at a rooming house.  How much is it?  How much is it to stay there?  I don't know exactly how much it is.  How do you...  Don't you pay somebody to stay there?  Or you just shack up with a guy and give him some favors and he lets you crash?  Tell her to shut up!  I'm still homeless.  I'm not...  I'm living with him.  Oh, so what are you doing there right now?  Like, who invited you over?  Diane.  Diane. 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  All right.  Well...  We got to cut our losses.  Owl dump out of the name.  Well, you can't say our name?  No, you probably can't say.  Even the first name?  No, it was Johnny somebody.  But he said, like, a last name.  That's what I heard anyway.  All right.  Let's cut our losses.  There's your update.  Thank you.  Losses?  That was a great update.  No, until this.  Now we got to just...  It's going nowhere.  Yeah, hello?  The drunk that you're living...  Hey, hey, that drunk you're living with there is really nice.  You're doing well.  She said you drink every day. 
[01:57:30]  She says you drink every day and you're not...  You're living in, like, a rooming house with a bunch of drunks and drug addicts.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Everybody over here is really cool.  Everybody over here is nice.  Really?  What do you know about cool?  You're an absentee mother.  What do you mean really cool?  Stop talking like it's 1967.  Yeah, that sounds fun.  All right, ladies.  All right.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  I'm listening.  I've been listening.  All you do is lie.  Just keep drinking.  Before you take adult steps again.  Shut up with the baby steps.  You either drink or you don't. 
[01:58:00]  Just stop.  Stop needing to be coddled and have your fat chin tickled.  Speaking of baby steps, miss a few more of your sons.  You know, no, no, no.  Yeah, how do you know what baby steps look like?  You were in a blackout while you took them.  Jim, you know about this.  I do.  And you know what?  I had to stop.  I didn't have a kid that I didn't take care of.  Right.  I finally had to stop.  You know what?  I finally had to tell myself no.  There you go.  Selfish drunk.  Goodbye, Lady Di.  Good day.  I wouldn't mind having a beer every once in a while, but you know what? 
[01:58:30]  I can't do it, so I don't.  There you go.  I'm no better than you.  I just made a decision you won't make.  All right, Lady Di.  Oh, shut up with your baby steps.  Keep rationalizing.  Not only a name, but a good idea.  Lady Di.  She's trying to use sober lingo to justify her drinking.  Yeah.  Wow, one day at a time, so I just drink one at a time.  Okay, good point.  By the way, it's 8.30 here in New York.  She's in a flop house somewhere, not working.  Where's this job?  What time do you have to be there?  Why aren't you working? 
[01:59:00]  All right, Justin in New Hampshire, what's up?  Mondo homeless person, the luscious locomotive lady died.  The art of the homeless.  I defy you to listen to her lying babble.  Very good.  All right, and finally, AJ from Jersey.  AJ.  Good morning, boy.  Welcome aboard.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  Can you just tell me the next update will be in the obituary?  Yeah, she is a wreck, man.  Have a great day.  Thank you.

[02:00:00]  Drink or my son?  Drink or my son?  I'll drink.  That's pretty much what you've done, lady and I.  No, no, no.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  That is not the story at all.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  It's the only virus spreading across America.  When I used to live in Westfield.  America.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Oh, my God.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Shuffle, shuffle.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:00:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, we didn't check the rest of the papers today.  By the way, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We checked the rest of the front pages today.  We're running out of time, but we pay attention to the cities we're being broadcast in.  And the New York Post here in New York City has an unbelievable front page. 
[02:01:00]  Her final moment.  Her final moment.  A chilling instant before Bo kills ex in Queens Bar.  And the front page is this guy reaching over the bar, pointing a gun at his ex, I guess.  Some blonde bimbo.  Right in her face.  The gun is literally an inch from her forehead.  And this is the picture right before he pulled the trigger.  It's on the front page of the New York Post today.  Yowch.  Then he hopped over the bar and proceeded to just unload right into her there. 
[02:01:30]  More shots.  Saved one for himself.  In a little tricky suicide move, he put the gun to his neck and pulled the trigger and was pronounced dead at the scene.  That's a tricky move.  That's taking a chance.  Especially with, I think he used like a 32 or something.  I don't think it was.  What was it?  A 25.  A 25?  That's a tricky move in the neck with a 25.  That ain't really guaranteed.  Anyone do any reading and find out why he did it? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, you're saying a lot of ricocheting, a lot of banging around in your neck with a small caliber.  A little roll.  Both Colombians, they broke up.  Colombians, huh?  Yeah, very jealous guys.  Yikes.  And they got deported.  And he must have snuck back into the country.  Because Sosa said so?  Because you expect me to believe he feels tilted because Sosa said so.  And then he shot her and pulled the old Omar on himself.  The old Omar Suarez.  And he just showed up and he just, he didn't, they said he didn't even argue with her.  He just called her and when she walked over to him, he pointed the pistol at her and just shot her. 
[02:02:30]  And then jumped over the bar and pumped bullets into her.  Yep.  And then just blew her head off.  A savage.  Chicago Tribune.  Pulling out our heartstrings today.  The enduring agony of a pit bull rampage.  Memories of a mauling and a boy's struggle to survive haunt a quiet community.  And they got a picture of the boy and he's still in really rough shape.  And he's being kind of hugged by somebody, his mother. 
[02:03:00]  Look at that picture.  Aww.  Palm Beach.  West Palm Beach.  Castro's daughter's on the front page.  Of course.  Very important story down there.  And everyone else is just basic stuff today.  Nothing that jumps out at you.  You see that story out of...  No, I didn't!  Oh, it's me and you out of San Francisco.  That that guy...  Didn't we talk to him on the phone?  We did an interview.  With San Francisco? 
[02:03:30]  With...  With...  Rosenthal, I think his name was.  I don't know.  God, I can't remember.  Punch it up on...  On...  A little Google action?  A little Google.  Let me get a little Google news thing.  I'll pop this up because it'll make sense.  Oh, how about that?  I gotta use this keyboard.  Now, Taltawk people are wondering, why did you just type in Opie and Anthony?  He's running dual keyboards over here. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Or high tech.  Yeah.  So what?  What did he say about it?  Well, it was a whole thing about...  Here it is.  Radio waves, I think it is.  All right.  Is that it?  No.  No, there's another article.  Damn it!  There's another article.  Why can't I find what I'm looking for when I want to find it?  But you read the article, so tell me what it was about.  But I think we talked to this guy on the phone.  We did an interview with him.  I'm so... 
[02:04:30]  I'm so done with these interviews because we talked to him for 45 minutes and then it's  like a...  It's like a...  One sentence.  But he had an agenda before the interview.  Oh, he did?  It was a whole thing on how...  Uh...  Uh...  Maybe it was Chicago.  That's why.  Yeah.  It was a whole...  And this is making this point completely.  It's a whole thing about how syndicated radio is taking over these  local markets and how awful it is.  But that guy in Chicago was nice to us.  But it was a whole thing about how bad it is.  And then, like, one quote of me at the end.  Local airwaves losing identity to syndication. 
[02:05:00]  That could be it.  Holy...  Yeah, Phil Rosenthal.  We talked to him for like an hour.  And what does...  Dude, he had an agenda.  And this is...  Hold on.  This was his story.  E-Rock, go all the way down.  See, E-Rock's controlling my mouse from over there.  Great.  Because I got two mouses that do other things.  I can't control three mouses.  Two, I can, but not three.  People can be very much entertained by a syndicated radio show out of New York,  said Anthony Cumia, the Anthony of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  We really think our show is very universal and very relatable,  no matter if you're in New York or in Chicago.  We talked to this guy for an hour and I missed sleeping?  I'm taking a nap for that?  That's all he used.  And then he writes, but like other syndicated stars, there's no more concern with the second  city than the fifth, sixth, and seventeenth.  Like he...  Now what these guys don't understand, local radio stinks!  Listen to... 
[02:06:00]  He goes, local powerhouses such as Crazy Howard McGee, El Pistolero, and Spike O'Dell,  along with Chicago headlines and traffic, are likely to always have an edge.  They provide something live you can't necessarily get off an iPod or from satellite pay radio.  What about nightly news that covers the whole country?  Why is that bad?  You want to laugh?  You can't...  You want to hear a traffic update?  Turn to traffic and come back!  He mentions Letterman and Leno are, you know, they do their shows from one location. 
[02:06:30]  So what's the problem?  See, that's what...  That's their...  Why am I yelling?  That's their own...  That's their only defense that these syndicated radio shows aren't local.  You know, if you took a poll, most people would go, who cares if it's not local?  As long as you're entertaining me and making me laugh.  He said, granted, television, Letterman, Leno, blah, blah, blah, they play for the rest of the country from L.A. or New York.  Radio, however, is a more intimate medium.  It's what you hear during your commute or the voice beside you on the job, not someone performing for you. 
[02:07:00]  Is that it?  Yeah, Dishbag, is that it?  When I want local in New York, I throw on the news station.  I get my local traffic, my local stories, my little feel-good story at the end, and then I move on to other things.  And local, if local was good, it would be syndicated.  Believe me, local doesn't just want to be local, stupid.  Yeah, they want to be syndicated.  Go ahead, listen to the Eric and Kathy if you want local.  Go have some laughs.  Ugh.  Phil Rosenthal bugs me. 
[02:07:30]  He stinks.  The guy talked to us for like an hour.  Phil Rosenthal...  Local flavor.  First of all, his head is that of a melon.  It is giant.  By the way, the people buy the newspaper, like, that's a local paper.  Do people still buy the New York Times when they're in Chicago?  No!  Or the L.A. Times?  Well, of course they do.  Oh, they got the Chicago Sun-Times.  The city won't allow it.  Well, we don't buy the New York Times in Chicago because it's not a local flavor.  I like a local flavor.  Do you?  And here it is.  But if you're in a top ten market where there's someone who's very good who's also sitting 
[02:08:00]  there going, boy, it's a beautiful day, or, oh my gosh, look how hard it's raining today,  that's liable to be more popular than someone in another market who's going, hi, Chi-Town,  how's it going?  That's the difference.  That's the difference.  So we should make sure we know what the weather is in Chicago every day so we can say it like  we're there.  That's his point.  That point stinks.  That's his point.  Phil Rosenthal stinks.  So you'd rather have a local guy going, boy, it's a beautiful day, or, oh my gosh, look 
[02:08:30]  how hard it's raining today?  Than somebody in a syndicated market going, hi, Chi-Town, and forget it, you will never  hear Chi-Town coming out of my mouth.  No way, unless it helps in ratings, then you'll hear it a lot.  How about this, you hat full of douche?  Look out your window and you know what the weather is.  Yeah.  Is that why you tune on a comedy show to learn the weather?  Stupid.  I want to laugh, but I'd also like to know if I should wear a slicker, you douchebag.  Local radio stinks. 
[02:09:00]  I wish I could remember the interview.  I forget what he sounded like.  Was he friendly?  Was he hostile?  He was really friendly.  That's what sucked.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Asked us a bunch of questions.  We gave a bunch of answers.  He used one quote that he could tie into his agenda for the thing.  Next time, douchebag, dishonest, effing reporter, let us know what your stupid angle is before  you waste our time.  I hate that.  They're all crazy.  All right.  I'm wrapping it up.  He rock.  What's he rock doing? 
[02:09:30]  Because we're busy, syndicated radio hosts.  Right.  Now we got to go to our second job.  We don't have time for your local paper, Phil.  We don't have time for it.  We got to go count our money.  Thanks a mil, Chi-town.  See you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Chicago.  Chicago.  And you didn't say goodbye to Chicago.  Goodbye to Chicago.  Second city.  We'll be talking here tomorrow.  We don't care about San Francisco.  What?  Screw San Francisco.  That's right.  Yeah, we're all about Chicago.  That's right. 
[02:10:00]  We're here in Chicago right now.  And Maine.  Oh, yeah.  Opie and Anthony are back.  Vincent's going to tell us what he learned this summer.  I spent three weeks with my Uncle Anthony.  And I learned a lot from listening to his radio program.  First of all, women on the radio stink on ice.  And all holes should be banned from the airwaves.  Next, it's good to live amongst the Jews.  They have all the money.  So they have nice houses and the crime rates are low.  Opie's name is first because he saved my uncle from blue-collar hell. 
[02:10:30]  Jimmy is a good egg, but I'm not allowed to be alone with him.  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  This rocks.  Who is this?  You don't know, Steve?  I don't know.  I don't care.  I'm just babbling. 
[02:11:00]  Just walk by the fucking killer.  Hi.  Welcome.  Another week of the Opie and Anthony show XM edition.  Good.  Exclusively on XM satellite radio.  This is the portion of the show where we can curse and talk about sexual contents in graphic fashion.  We could even have sex.  Jimmy?  I like it.  Come on.  Get over here.  Where's the opester?  Got stuck in the bathroom.  That guy's dump dog is barking again.  Pinched out a log.  And then ran. 
[02:11:30]  Tom now has no place in this program because it is XM's.  Tom has no place in this program.  What happened?  This exclusive XM satellite.  You were talking to Tom.  And I said, Tom has no place in this portion of the program, which is exclusively on XM satellite radio.  He's interfering.  I'm sorry.  What do we got?  Stupid meetings after work, right?  Yeah.  That's what they tell me.  That's what they tell me.  Meetings with sales.  So you were trying to get it pushed off or canceled? 
[02:12:00]  I was working for us, dude.  That ain't going to happen.  Not this one.  I was working to get free lunch and make sure the meetings are short.  We got two, right?  Two.  Back to back.  Oh, that's going to be fun, fun, fun.  At least I'll have the drive home to look forward to when it's really traffic-y.  Maybe he'll let us know what's going on with the TV commercial.  It should be ready.  Oh.  It should be ready to go.  Yes.  Dude, dude, dude.  It's cold today in New York.  No, it's kind of nice. 
[02:12:30]  It's sunny.  Oh, there he is.  Look.  That's the old man.  This guy hates us.  This is the guy we were yelling at on what?  Poor dog.  Tied up on that short little leash.  Feels so bad for him.  Oh, that poor puppy dog.  Hi, boy.  Don't worry.  He'll be dead soon, and you'll get a better owner.  Oh, my God.  Are you nuts?  What did he say?  What did he say?  Wait, the crowd's laughing.  What did the guy say?  Up your asshole. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, okay.  He's pretty much choking his own dog, though.  What did he say?  Up your asshole?  Yeah, something like that.  No, up yours asshole.  All right.  Yeah.  Trying to make up.  And he's coming our way.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Let's ask him why he uses such a short leash.  He is a miserable old fuck.  You can't ask him anything.  Oh, look at this guy.  He looks like a pedophile.  What is that thing on your head, sir?  That's wonderful.  What is that fucking bird nest? 
[02:13:30]  Goodness.  Is that real hair?  A strange group of people out today.  They're awful.  I don't know what's happening.  An odd city this morning.  Police barricades.  We ought to barricade something in.  That guy and his dog would throw things at him.  Miserable old codger.  Where is he?  Dreams he had that went to the wayside.  He's right behind us.  Oh, is he miserable?  Is he following us? 
[02:14:00]  I think so.  That's going to be nothing but a problem in another day or two.  I miss him.  I keep seeing him.  It's definitely a problem.  Oh.  He went the other way.  Did he?  Did he really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's going that way.  God damn it.  All right.  He's holding the dog on his short leash because he's too old to control it.  So if it's a longer leash, it's just going to drag him.  Just break his little arm off. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  There'll be a rabid dog running with an old arm attached to a leash.  He's in a spot.  Snap it off like a turkey leg.  The video of us yelling at the old man for Friday is up on opianthony.com.  I got to see that, too.  It's pretty funny.  There's a lot of really good videos up there today.  Was this from the Dominican parade?  What parade was this week?  Dominican parade.  That's why all the police blockades. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my God.  It's throw mama from the train.  Was it peaceful?  Oh, my God.  It is.  What was it?  Erwin?  Erwin.  Wow.  Owen.  Owen.  Owen.  Wow.  I'd like to fuck the hat right off her.  Owen.  Owen.  Listen to me.  Oh.  Owen.  I want to put her on her hands and knees and fuck her until her hat falls off.  And then fuck her until she puts it back on.  Yeah, she's dressed like Annie Hall. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, jeez.  That's horrible.  Jesus.  There you go.  Hi, gents.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Two gentlemen.  Kick the coffee out of this guy's hand.  Oh, no.  You can't do that.  You get in trouble.  How would that be funny?  Holding three coffees.  That's an ample-breasted woman.  I know.  Hello.  Trying to stay cool.  Uh-huh.  That's all I have.  That's all you got.  No, because the red joke was flying out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what happened with Ed Norton? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, that's right.  Weren't we supposed to have Edward Norton in?  He's supposed to be in, then a phone call, and then I just saw Steve's big thumb wipe his name off of our guest board and say, no, he's not coming.  You know why?  Because The Illusionist is going to be a really good movie.  He's getting great reviews already.  And what's, uh, so what's the deal?  We're, uh, he's finding out his schedule, and Roland is going to find out his availability today.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, well.  Wow.  Screw you.  He's shooting somewhere.  Look at us just staring at him.  I know, look, we're just staring at his poster.  Maybe he'll come to life.  He'll, he'll be there.  Look at this old lady in her tracksuit.  Look.  Oh, man.  And that's it today, I guess.  There's not much going on.  That was pretty mellow, aside from the guy telling me to stick it up my ass or something. 
[02:17:00]  That was pretty good.  The old guy.  That was all right.  Oh, watch your back there, Opie.  What happened?  Girl coming through.  You're in the way.  Did she, was she angry with you?  Yeah.  She made a face.  Like, you said, I'm sorry.  You turned around, she made, like, a face.  Yeah.  God damn people got no fucking patience.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  What, you like that, Jim?  Oh, how do you not like that?  She's wearing a, that thing is knitted.  You can see right through it. 
[02:17:30]  That's why I'm looking.  Look at her ass.  Oh.  Her grandma knitted that.  We, we see your hiney.  Nice hiney!  We see your hiney.  Hey, you!  Nice hiney!  You and the pig!  Nice hiney!  You really can see it.  That's great.  We have nothing.  We're trying to make something up here.  It's not working today.  She wouldn't turn around.  Might have been a good, uh, confrontation.  Hey, that's good.  Oh, here comes this douchebag. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, wait.  That's the wrong guy.  Say hi to Ron for us.  Ooh.  Clint.  He looks just like Clint Howard.  Holy shit.  I got one in.  We'll continue upstairs.  The war.  The war.  The war.  The war.  The war.  Massican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit. 
[02:18:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  It's perversion for power.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  El virus.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[02:19:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  or whatever.  That's terrible.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Go.  guitar solo 
[02:19:30]  Welcome to the second half 
[02:20:00]  of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Right.  The dirty parts.  The dirty parts.  Dirty, dirty, dirty  Dirty parts.  What is this about? Oh, Sonny Pirelli.  God damn it, I'm freezing.  Yeah, it's cold in here.  Can you get my gray long sleeve 
[02:20:30]  from my backpack?  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, Jesus fucking Christ. You guys have been  playing this fucking commercial on XM  Satellite Radio. Fucking  a public service announcement for fucking  CRN for fucking bank  foreclosed homes. Yeah. And they're telling  me to fucking call if my last name  begins with fucking A to  N today. And then fucking  tomorrow I can call if my last  name starts from fucking zero, from  O to Z. Right.  But every time tomorrow comes, they play the fucking 
[02:21:00]  same one from A to N.  All right.  You know something? I've noticed that too.  You really did?  Yeah.  It's like, when do the poor people from O to Z  get to call if every day...  I want to buy a fucking...  Every fucking day. I don't believe it.  I want to buy a foreclosed home and my real  last name stops with a fucking P.  I was thinking, though, perhaps  if you called, I think  they'd take your call regardless  of what, you know, letter  your name started with. I could 
[02:21:30]  be wrong. But it does  seem odd that after every day  they'd play the same commercial and only the  privileged A through N  get to call in.  That is terrific.  All right, boys.  All right. Thank you, sir.  Be fairly observant.  Sonny Forelli.  Let's go to Rob in Indiana. Rob, what's up?  Oh, B. Anthony, Jimmy, it's Rob.  Hey, I want to let you know that song  you guys were getting into is a song  called Nights of Cydonia  by a band called Muse  off their album Black Holes and Revelations. 
[02:22:00]  It's an unbelievable album.  Hey, what?  What?  When were we getting into a song?  On your walkover, you guys were going,  the song was Jimmy,  you're like, this really cool song.  Oh, right.  It was the song that came on  while you were still talking to Tom.  Oh, okay.  The beginning song?  I didn't know what that was,  but it kind of sounded cool.  I want you guys to pick up this album, all right?  Oh, okay.  Give it up for me.  All right?  Well, thanks, Rob.  Thank you.  You guys tell me to buy something.  I'll buy something for you guys, all right?  All right, go to eatabullet.com 
[02:22:30]  and get my CDs.  There you go.  All right, I'll do it today, buddy.  No, you really have to do it, though.  Yes, you will.  I'm going to do it right now.  Punch it up.  All right, thank you, sir.  That's a cool plug there, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man, I was hoping that line would get through.  What's that?  Oh, handjobs to hobos.  I didn't think handjobs to hobos would make the cut there.  I was trying to make a hobo cum joke on that other show.  Yeah, I don't think that was getting through.  I just couldn't figure it out in my stupid mind. 
[02:23:00]  Stupid.  Ah, they're fucking annoying.  Caller describing his children at 6.16 a.m., 8.16, giving handjobs to hobos.  Opie describing Lady Di's behavior at the railroad tracks.  And, oh, he writes a note today.  What?  He likes to write notes there as well to help us along for future broadcasts.  All right.  No, during the discussion with Lady Di and the homeless woman,  and Anthony asked the homeless woman who invited her to the halfway house.  She slurred Diane, and Anthony thought she gave out a guy's full name  and thought I would dump out. 
[02:23:30]  Listening through the second delay, she definitely said Diane, so I did not dump out.  Okay, it sounded like she said John something.  Why is Derek so happy?  Derek, grab a microphone.  Don't spell.  I didn't hear you say anything either, and Eric was asking if I dump,  so I was kind of a...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I didn't know what you were listening to, to be honest.  Because I was like, what?  I'll listen to the replay in here, because it sounded like...  Because I asked her a question, whose place is it?  And it sounded like she said John somebody. 
[02:24:00]  Like, and gave a name.  Like, John was the first name and then a last name.  So I thought that was a name.  All right.  My mistake.  What the fuck?  What am I?  Infallible?  What am I?  The fucking Pope?  We were about to play 89-year-old Granny Fens-Off Attacker when we got distracted with that  Chicago writer.  Right.  I did read that, thinking, wow, where did he get this Anthony quote from?  And it turns out, yeah, we talked to him for a while.  A long time. 
[02:24:30]  Half hour, 40 minutes.  Prick.  Yeah, an agenda.  Happens all the time.  Prick.  Hasn't happened in a while, though.  That guy, we've been pretty smart and been able to spot him.  But that guy was all nice on the phone.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  I'm here at Chicago Tribune.  Going to write a little story about you guys.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hey.  He asked us a bunch of questions.  And he already knew his story was going to be about syndicated radio personalities coming  into Chicago and how bad that is.  We'll find our audience. 
[02:25:00]  We'll find our audience in Chicago and all these other cities we're in.  Don't worry about it.  And then everyone else could do the local angle.  Go, screw.  Who cares?  That's what I say.  Hey.  Let's go to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Jeremy.  Talk number 458 reporting.  Just letting you know that I have a ton of wild stickers and I've been sticking them all  over the bus here because they don't have billboards.  You guys just stupid rover.  Well, eventually we'll get some advertising in these other cities.  So we'll, you know.  Oh, I got it, man. 
[02:25:30]  He's got wild stickers all over his face on the buses around here.  Are you going to our comedy show in Cleveland?  Oh, yeah, man.  My girl already won tickets off of 92.3, so I'm already there.  Oh, great, man.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah, man.  Very good.  What's the date?  I got a pretty good...  What's the date on the Cleveland show?  September 23rd, I think?  Yeah, it's at the Tower City Amphitheater.  That's right.  Cool.  Yeah, not the Tower Center because I was the one that corrected you before.  And even though we're being broadcasted in afternoons or whatever, we're going to go  up there and do a show. 
[02:26:00]  That's all right.  Sooner or later...  Is that how we're doing it?  Well, I don't know.  I guess we'll just do our morning show from Cleveland, and then they'll replay it in the  afternoon.  Oh, in the afternoon.  In the afternoon.  It's going to be a little weird, but we'll make it happen.  So we'll broadcast a lot.  I'm kind of pretty friendly with my manager here, Nardboy, the PD.  I like him a lot.  And that's how I got all the loud stickers.  Yeah, he's a good guy, man.  He believes in the show.  Yeah, he gets the show, definitely, man.  As soon as I told him I was a test man, he was all up on sending me loud stickers.  Right.  All right, cool.  Yeah, so, you know, see you later, guys. 
[02:26:30]  Thank you, Jeremy.  I appreciate what you're doing for us in Cleveland.  Let's say hi to Tom in Pennsylvania.  Tom?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, Anthony.  No offense, man, but you're also the same guy we thought he heard Jimmy's asshole talk  to him.  Jimmy's asshole did talk to me.  You're right, sir.  Had a little chat with me one day.  Wow.  George in Cleveland.  Hey, boys.  Got to call you out this morning.  Yeah.  Ozone midget sighting.  I was wondering when we're coming back to the show.  Meanwhile, back at the show. 
[02:27:00]  Wow.  You guys pick up on everything.  That was a long one.  That was back in the show.  Amen.  Have a good one, boys.  All right.  Are we attacking Lamont and Tonelli?  What's going on?  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing they're saying things.  I don't know.  It's an unsubstantiated rumor and speculation, but, yeah, there's some kind of attack going  on.  Doug?  What's up, boys?  What's up?  Yeah, apparently these guys called us out on the whack bag on Saturday or Friday, and 
[02:27:30]  we did a little looking into their site.  And they do a great little promotion on Wednesdays called Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  We did notice that.  So they said we didn't have any balls to bring it to them.  So we got assembled.  We are calling them now.  But they've blocked every area code except for the San Francisco area because they're 
[02:28:00]  only on in the San Francisco area.  Did they really say that, though?  You actually know that they said that, Doug?  What's that?  They actually did say something?  Yes.  We actually got a blog website that one of them runs, too, that they were talking about  the pests on, also.  Okay.  Well, the one thing I know about Lamont Antonelli is that they blatantly took our wow thing.  And then when that girl flashed her boobs on the Today Show, they claimed that it was  one of theirs.  Yeah.  And I could not believe they would actually say that on their show and that people would 
[02:28:30]  believe them.  And then what?  I think they changed their wow promotion into Ta-Ta Tuesdays or something.  Ta-Ta Tuesdays.  I want to say I've seen it on their website.  They do them both.  Great.  Yeah.  Their website, when I went there, I was just like, oh, my God.  These guys, are they even...  Do they even want to do this?  Because they're such hacks.  It's such radio hackdom.  Morning radio hack.  Oh, they do the Dick Insider bit. 
[02:29:00]  Isn't that something you buy from like a bit warehouse or something like that?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  That's where you get that from.  Oh, my God.  Piece of shit hacks.  And then they call us out and they block every area code.  Because 888 numbers can block area codes.  So you don't get a lot of charges.  You know, you got to pay for it because you got to pay for all free numbers, obviously.  And they blocked everything but their local numbers.  I got to tell you, radio is filled with people that just have no pride and they take bits from other radio shows. 
[02:29:30]  Have some pride.  But for the most part, radio shows have left the Whip It Out Wednesday thing alone,  except for Mancow attempted to do it in Chicago by calling it Whip It Out Wednesday because he likes to see cock, I guess.  And Lamont Antonelli were the other show that blatantly took the wow thing.  But for the most part, all the other radio shows left it alone.  They really look like thieves and hacks.  Like, you look at the wacky picture on their side.  Zany.  Like, you know, the two guys.  The one guy's giving a noogie to the black guy.  He was giving the black guy a noogie, wasn't he? 
[02:30:00]  Can we get some audio from them?  Is there any way we can get some of their audio?  Like, Whip It Out Wednesday and stuff?  Hey, we got some.  We got Lamont Antonelli.  Okay.  Well, they're the inventors of Ta-Ta Tuesdays.  The thieves.  Like wow, but on Tuesdays.  And laugh or wretch Wednesdays.  Callers call in with jokes to try to win a prize.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Like a contest.  That's laser radio.  No, that's a good bit, though.  Because if the joke was funny, you win a gift.  That's a good one. 
[02:30:30]  Well, maybe we can play it then.  That's going to be funny.  Hey, you got a joke?  Because we want to laugh.  Is that how it goes?  And if we laugh, we'll give you tickets to the ONA traveling virus.  All right.  Ah, okay.  But if we wretch, you don't get tickets to the ONA traveling virus.  Isn't it easy to not laugh at a joke on the phone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But do they really wretch, though?  Like, is it that bad that somebody gets sick?  Or is that the part of the...  Do they actually get sick?  Or is it a bit...  I bet the wretching part is actually a puke sound effect. 
[02:31:00]  And then when they want to give away the tickets, finally, after the bit's over, they're just like...  Oh, that is a gosh darn good one.  You just won yourself two Meineke mufflers and a shotgun blast to the face.  Fucking douchebag thieves.  You cunting thieves.  Hold on, Doug.  We might need you.  Let's go to Godzilla, the trucker.  Hot Hot Tuesday raises money for breast cancer.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I'm getting to that.  You're not even going to...  Yeah.  Godzilla.  Raising money for cock-cock cancer. 
[02:31:30]  What's up, Opie Anthony?  Hello, Jimmy Norton.  What are you hauling, Godzilla?  What you got?  I'm about to get a load of dirty Angel Sand.  Angel Island Sand.  Angel Island Sand?  Yeah, I have a dump truck.  I deliver sand for mound systems, for septic systems in the country.  Anyway...  Great.  Hey, Godzilla, we got asked the question, what did you want to be when you were growing up?  Yeah.  What did I want to be?  Uh, well, my dad was a master builder and carpenter, and I can't... 
[02:32:00]  No, no, no, no, no, Godzilla.  How old...  You don't seem that old.  How old are you?  I'm 41.  All right.  So there's probably videotape of you as a kid saying, I want to be...  Uh, it was probably an astronaut, Opie.  Yeah, an astronaut's always a big one.  Yeah, but the astrophysics escaped me.  So now you're hauling...  Godzilla, right?  You're hauling septic tank sand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It pays $100 an hour, and the fuel is $335. 
[02:32:30]  Whatever you've got to tell yourself to get through the day, my friend.  Let me explain how...  Oh, stop it.  You'd be beating Ken if it wasn't for Opie.  Get off of me.  Oh!  Let me explain what's going on here.  Godzilla's calling our show to help us out, and we feel like we have to beat the shit out  of him before he helps us out.  I don't know.  Why?  I don't know.  God, we're awful people.  You're right.  All right, Godzilla.  And I pay for this abuse daily.  Jesus, what an asshole.  We're just kidding.  Thanks for calling, dummy.  We're the worst. 
[02:33:00]  Ah, whatever.  Godzilla.  All right, ground control to Godzilla.  What the fuck you got for us today?  I got Lamont and Tinelli.  We're on a little station called KSJL out of San Jose for about 25 to 30 years.  It is now a Mexican station.  They moved to a classic rock station in San Francisco.  Yeah, they moved to the Bone.  1077, the Bone.  Yeah.  And their worthless hole is a little brown guy from some foreign country in the Middle  East.  Some little brown guy. 
[02:33:30]  He used to work at a convenience store, and he speaks English so poorly, and he laughed  at everything, so they made him the hole.  He never worked at a convenience store, by the way.  That's just part of the joke.  Right.  I guarantee you.  Well, actually, he did.  I don't care.  Let me spit out my misinformation.  Tranquility base, the shit sand has landed.  Anthony, thank you.  One small step for man, one giant dump for mankind. 
[02:34:00]  One small step for man, one giant dump for mankind.  We appreciate this.  I have no idea what you just said, but thank you, Godzilla.  Oh, me?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, Godzilla.  All right.  Pinchy, what's up?  Hey, if you give a black guy a noogie, shouldn't it be called a noogie?  Well, I'm just saying.  Hey, that's really funny.  Bob in San Francisco, Bob.  Yeah, I got nothing, but I got a call in today on him, and they dumped out of it. 
[02:34:30]  Of course they did.  What did you say?  I go, wow.  And I thought that'd get through.  And then I said, Opie and Anthony, XM202.  He goes, yeah, nice try, buddy.  And they dumped.  Oh, yeah, Lycus did steal WoW, too.  Yeah.  Lycus is a cunt.  Yeah, Dom Lycus, shall we hear?  I don't talk like this.  How about I throw somebody into the fireplace on Christmas Eve?  You tool.  Could we go home early and just play that bit? 
[02:35:00]  That's one of my favorites.  One of my favorites.  All right.  Doug.  Yeah, they did a great TSA song parody a few minutes ago.  You guys just missed it.  I just stopped laughing.  What was it?  Well, it was about airports and screening too heavy and how inconvenient it is.  Oh, so like, again, the services, the song parody services that put these out, sell them  to various markets around the country, they whip these things up in a day or two. 
[02:35:30]  They're awful.  And that's what they're playing.  That's their fucking entertainment.  All right.  They have to talk for two minutes every fucking hour, and they have to play recorded material  that someone else did.  And you know why they're attacking this show?  Because they know that they're going to be called out on their thievery.  Right.  They know, it's almost like, as a comedian, if you've been doing a joke, like say you've  been doing some stupid airline joke, and somebody else shows up, the comic who wrote it, and  you know he wrote it, you're like, oh, I've got to start bashing him so nobody all of a 
[02:36:00]  sudden looks at me as a thief.  Right.  You fucking thieves.  That's what you are.  You're fucking thieves.  Fucking cocksuckers.  Stealing, stealing an idea and proudly displaying it.  Go to Prep Burger, you jizzbuckets.  With your fucking wacky little Arnold fucking from Different Strokes sidekick with a funny  accent.  Rub his little head.  Waka, waka, waka, waka.  Why don't you stand him in the front yard with a fucking lamp in his hand?  Well, what really sums it up is I found their MySpace last night, and they had a whole 670 
[02:36:30]  friends.  Now, these are guys that do a radio show out in San Francisco.  I have 2,800 friends, and I just call yours.  Will they accept posts?  Of course.  I put some pictures of LemonParty.org and Tub Girl all over their comments.  What is their MySpace address?  That's fair.  It is MySpace.com slash Lamont Antonelli. 
[02:37:00]  Lamont, L-A-M-O-N-T-A-N-D-T-O-N-E-L-L-I.  Lamont Antonelli.  Lamont Antonelli.  All right.  Their MySpace page.  I think you should post some comments.  It's all in good fun, LOL.  And Pest's out in San Francisco.  They don't pre-screen the calls from what I see, but yeah, their phone number is locked  down to the California area.  Oh, we need our San Francisco guys to get in there. 
[02:37:30]  Of course their phone's locked down because they talk like that.  Right.  And they say, bring it on.  Pussies.  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  Oh, and then they lock down the phone.  They're complete fucking faggots and frauds.  They're fucking cowards.  Don't open yourself up like that and then not take calls.  Why wouldn't you want calls from all over the country?  You got balls.  You don't have balls.  You're fucking thieves.  Excuse me.  We can't compete against a show that names every day of the week.  Oh, no.  Every day?  Oh, no. 
[02:38:00]  Holy fuckaroni.  Wow.  From open mic Mondays to ta-ta Tuesdays to laugh or wretch Wednesdays to do you a favor  Thursday to last but not least, Dirty Fridays.  Dirty Fridays.  Guys, bring your morning laughter on every day of the week.  What's Dirty Fridays?  I don't know.  It's got to be awful.  Then they have suck a cock Saturday, sit on a cock Sunday, my ass hurts Monday. 
[02:38:30]  And what is stupid ta-ta Tuesday?  They give it all the money that breath can't tear?  Is that the excuse they use so they can do it?  Yeah, because I'm sure management came to them and said, look, man, the women's groups  are coming out of the woodwork and like pussies, they listened to their bosses and said,  look, you know, if we spin this right, you can still do this.  Why don't we make this a charity, guys?  Here's what we're going to do.  Make it a charity.  Taking the whole edge out of the bit.  Shouldn't it just be called ta-t Tuesdays? 
[02:39:00]  Fucking thieving douchebags.  They did save the ta-tas promotion.  Save the ta-tas promotion.  Raising money for breast cancer research would save the ta-tas t-shirts.  There you go.  Who says fucking ta-tas?  No one.  She has nice ta-tas, doesn't she?  No, she doesn't.  Here it is.  The Breast Cancer Fund, 107.7 The Bone and the Breast Cancer Fund have teamed up for  ta-ta Tuesdays.  Have they?  One in eight American women will face breast cancer in her lifetime and prevention is the 
[02:39:30]  key to stopping this epidemic.  Join Lamont and Tonelli in supporting the Breast Cancer Fund, a national non-profit dedicated  to breast cancer prevention.  You can help by donating money at any ta-ta Tuesday appearance listed above.  What a transparent shit-dick promotion that is.  If it was sincere, it would be one thing, and it wouldn't be promoted like a big thing,  but they're using it to get away with doing this.  They actually got a picture of them on a stage in their Tommy Bahama shirts. 
[02:40:00]  No, they don't.  Because nothing says-  Stop it.  Nothing says edgy radio host like a-  Like a-  Oh.  Tommy Bahama shirt.  Stop.  And an oversized check.  The huge giant check that they're-  Are you proud that you raised a few money, a few- a few dollars for breast cancer?  Are ya?  These guys are fucking-  What awful-  They're wearing their fucking shorts.  The one guy has capri pants.  What faggots.  Oh, God.  These hacks.  And that fucking Idi Amin in the middle.  They stink. 
[02:40:30]  Idi Amin.  Fucking local jizz bags.  Like Idi Amin.  Of course it does.  Fucking pig meat.  Some fucking monster of-  Of- of nameless race with sunglasses holding a check.  Oh.  Fucking douche bags.  He should be blowgunning monkeys out of trees.  He certainly should.  I saw that on the Discovery Channel.  It's classic.  Oh, but I can't do it.  Good night.  Say that.  Then they make a little-  They take the tail and tie it around the monkey's head and carry it home like a purse.  Oh, that's smart.  It's wonderful, and it's wonderfully savage.  Guys, but they got a box of silicone scones, cleavage croissants, and other ta-ta treats. 
[02:41:00]  Stop it.  Compliments of our friends that-  And they give the website.  Stop it.  They actually had a bakery make things and give them wacky little names that go with breasts.  What are they, muffins with a little M&M on each one?  Oh, God.  You get two muffins, one is bitten in half?  Looks like it's been bitten in half by a homeless guy.  And according to Sam, they always talk over music beds. 
[02:41:30]  Of course they do.  Sure they do.  Fucking assholes.  Boy, they know that they're having problems.  Oh, they know where it's coming at.  They know.  And they're trying to-  Your best defense is a good offense.  Is it, cocksuckers?  Have fun.  Have fun while you can.  Good luck, shit dicks.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Well.  Well-  Ta-ta, Tuesdays.  Oh, wait.  Oh, fuck your mothers.  All right.  They, uh-  Oh, hey, a little anger management problem. 
[02:42:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ugh.  Let me see.  What do they got?  Well, they, uh, you can check out Baby Huey's haircut.  Backstage at the Grammys.  Bobbo's hot sports pics.  Ew.  The bone on your backside.  Oh, I get it.  It's like a cock up your ass.  Uh.  Oh, fuck.  Well, let me see what the bone on your backside's all about here.  Let's, uh, let's check out the-  Oh.  Ew.  Ew.  What is-  Oh, I see.  Oh, mm.  It's like-  Oh, oh.  It's like-  What is that? 
[02:42:30]  Bonehead Rochelle tans the bone onto her backside.  See the bone on your backside.  And here's a close-up of her sunburned ass that's awful.  That is a horrid ass.  Wait, wait.  She put the logo and, like, got a little-  A little cutout.  Right.  And then sunburned it into her ass.  And then put that on her ass to let herself get a sunburn.  When you peel it off, there's a Bode logo on her ass.  Wow.  Then you got Bonehead Victor gets a bone tattoo.  Fucking-  Not one of those fake ones, they write. 
[02:43:00]  It's a real fucking tattoo.  And then bone smokers, Lamont and Tinelli, suck cock all day.  Right.  And they jerk the type of bones that spit bone marrow all over their faces and backs while  that fucking raceless weird thing just fucking stands there.  That fucking-  Whatever that little fucking laughing monster you have.  Holy shit, you two fucking organ grinders.  Whatever that thing is.  Like the fuck I'm right in the mouth.  Hey, guys. 
[02:43:30]  They also do Dirty Friday.  They did their drunk driving show.  Oh, what is that?  I'm sure it had a message.  And the money will go to Mad.  Mad.  Another lesson for the kids, everybody.  It's Lamont and Tinelli's drunk driving show 2005.  Oh, 2005.  So they do this every year.  What does this entail?  Officers Mel and Steve getting the breathalyzer ready for Lamont.  Ah, here they go.  They're going to drink a little bit.  That under the safety of a sanctioned police course, they probably drive, right?  See if they can make it through the cones.  If you're going to be drinking, you might as well drink with our friends from Hooters. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, why not?  Let's get sales.  Why don't they use that for the fucking breast cancer thing?  Hooter.  Hooter.  Fucking assholes.  Fuck you and your socially responsible messages.  Thieves.  Oh, here we go.  Officer Steve explaining to Lamont the dangers of drinking and driving.  Yeah.  How about this?  Officer Steve is a cunt face.  Olivia Newton hot wings.  Do you think you're doing good for the community, you asses? 
[02:44:30]  Officer Mel.  As you bore your audience to death with these little lessons.  Do you have a lesson planner?  Didn't Officer Mel ask for two first class tickets to England round trip while he shook down Tony?  Come on.  Guys.  We can talk about this.  Can't shoot a radio host.  Guys, Lamont blew a .16 with Officer Mel.  Well, that's pretty outrageous, but of course, there's got to be someone a little more outrageous.  Oh-ho!  And that would be Tonelli, who blew a .23! 
[02:45:00]  Wow!  And that little thing in the middle just carried a basket on his head and ran in circles.  Well, that's fantastic.  What is the...  God damn it!  Wrong button shit, dick.  Motherfucker!  What?  What is the what?  Someone needs to die!  What happened?  What happened?  Someone needs to...  Why don't I have a beep here?  Fan, I'd get that beep in there.  Why'd they...  Oh my God!  Why'd they keep...  I'll beep for you.  I was gonna beep for him.  You good. 
[02:45:30]  No, you said it first.  You might have a better, higher-pitched voice than I do, though.  Beep!  Beep!  Which one do you want?  Which sounds more realistic?  Wait, which one do you want?  Neither.  What?  Can I have both?  No, either...  Beep!  Beep!  I like Jimmy's.  I knew you liked him better.  It'll cover it up.  Yours won't cover it up.  Yours isn't...  Let's try both.  Let's try yours.  Go ahead.  You go first.  Oh, I don't wanna.  Why?  What did the...  What did the...  What did the...  Nigger! 
[02:46:00]  Oh, you're...  That wasn't the beep.  LOL!  LOL!  Well, there's a lesson on racism, everybody.  Racism is bad.  Racism is bad.  You get it?  We're donating to a five.  Well, I didn't mean to say that.  That's the only reason we said nigger, because racism is bad.  Fucking asshole.  Holy self-promotion, hiding behind a charity. 
[02:46:30]  You.  Fucking cock lickers.  Holy shit.  Fucking...  Oh, they make me sick.  Well, Sully, uh...  So, Lamar...  Ah, fuck Sully right in his throat.  I'd fucking lay Sully on a desk and tip his fucking head back and fuck his throat.  Yeah.  Mumbling your deli accent now, you fucking sideshow fucking attraction.  Running around laughing.  Bah!  Ah!  I don't even know what he sounds like.  I've never seen him.  And I hate him. 
[02:47:00]  Holy shit.  That fucking dictator.  Hey, Paul Pott, go fuck yourself.  Well, Sully, let's remember here.  Lamar blew a .16.  But Tonelli's the outrageous one.  He blew a .23.  And, of course, you gotta have the other side of this whole thing.  Right.  Sully blew a .05.  Wow.  Of course, he's the responsible one.  What a wimp.  Wait, which one has him done?  Is Tonelli the one who's kind of given the noogie?  I can't tell which one's crazier. 
[02:47:30]  I'm not over there anymore.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I'm just trying.  Okay.  So that was that show.  That must have been terrific.  I gotta tell you.  Oh, then they got a section called Goofy Pictures.  Let's see what's going on.  Goofy.  That's a good word.  The word alone makes you laugh.  And then you see the pictures.  It's over, Tonelli.  I will only accept that page if there are pictures of people with Down Syndrome.  If that's what's on their Goofy Pictures page, my head comes off to them.  Because what's more Goofy looking?  That's right.  Nothing, I say. 
[02:48:00]  Nothing.  Fuckers, stop going to the same website we are.  Yeah, you fuckers.  They've already ruined their MySpace.  You can't even get on it.  Of course not.  They have a picture.  All it says, because it's not loading, right click and push show picture.  Oh, okay.  Right click.  Can you do that?  In the square.  Right click.  And then see show picture.  Yeah.  Ah!  He's giving a noogie.  And the other guy's got his mouth open like he's yelling something outrageous.  Oh, because he probably is. 
[02:48:30]  He's probably just going, bah!  Well, remind me.  We'll have to go back to Goofy Pictures.  Yeah, when the traffic goes down a bit.  Fucking music bed.  I'm sure they're not used to anybody hitting the website.  Of course they're not.  Fucking whip-mouth Wednesday thieves.  Let's go under a human CD holder competition.  This has got to be a doozy.  I bet it's a bunch of people on their hands and knees with their assholes up in the air  while people put CDs in their ass cracks.  Now, that's a contest I support. 
[02:49:00]  Human CD holder competition.  What our listeners won't do to win backstage passes.  What they won't do.  Bone Bash.  What'd I say?  I'm just saying.  I'm repeating.  What they won't do.  The Bone Bash.  What our listeners won't do to win backstage passes to Bone Bash 6 featuring Judas Priest  and Queensryche.  How appropriate that those would want fucking Halford and Queensryche.  Zergog.  Bone's the matter.  Couldn't foundry get booked.  Zergog and Big Dick Black came into the Bone Studios to vie for the grand prize and Lamont 
[02:49:30]  and Tinelli aren't letting them off easy.  Oh, no.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I bet you they don't.  Those guys just take it to the limit.  Like when you need a cock in your ass, they put it in as far as they can.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Oh, that uppity nigger.  Whoa, whoa.  What was that?  Oh, my gosh.  What was that?  Look at the Blazing Saddles clip.  I didn't hear it.  Oh, my.  I'm Big Dick Black.  These guys are faggots. 
[02:50:00]  One of the contestants is putting on a glove.  Uh-oh.  A white glove with some lube.  Uh-huh.  He's now lubing what it looks like the ass of a listener.  Yeah.  And then he's putting the CD in his ass.  See the human CD holder.  There you go.  There you go.  That's what you get on the Lamont.  Oh, God.  What is it?  A guy putting a CD.  Wait.  He lubed his ass. 
[02:50:30]  And this guy's so outrageous, he's holding two CDs with his butt crack.  So now you've got to hold the CD in your lubed ass crack.  Right.  While Lamont and Tonelli sit there.  Oh, my God.  Look at this smelly animal.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What is that?  Dude, they actually lubed these guys' asses up?  Yeah.  He's a fucking aborigine with CDs in his ass.  He has no idea what they are.  He thinks they're gods.  He's worshipping them.  Oh, I get it. 
[02:51:00]  I got it.  What?  They lube it up because they throw the CDs into the guy's asses.  No way.  And then the first guy to drop a CD, because you've got to hold your cheeks together.  Yeah, you've got to hold your cheeks together.  And it would be hard if your ass is lubed.  So here it says, one of Big Dick Black CDs dropped first, so congrats, Zergog.  You're going backstage at Bone Bash 6.  Did anyone really win here, though?  What do you win after you drop the CDs?  A fucking ten minutes alone with Rob Halford?  Your own bone bashing? 
[02:51:30]  Well, it's kind of weird that they're looking for the guy that has the best ass muscles to go backstage.  That must be a wonderful meet and greet.  They need someone with a tight, lubed ass.  Miss Morning Sickness, Oakland A's Taco Contest.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It goes on.  See, I got emails from somebody.  We weren't going to mention this.  It seems like it's from the Lamont and Tonelli site, but I don't want to mention it just in case it wasn't those guys.  I don't know if it's them or not.  I've hated these douches for years. 
[02:52:00]  All right, good.  Let's just attack them outright.  Because they've been known in the business as one of the biggest rip-off radio shows out there.  The pest can use a spoof card to change their caller ID so they get through.  The service also lets them record a conversation so they can send it to you.  The URL is spoofcard.com.  Spoof card.  Look into that.  I don't know what it is.  Someone's just throwing it out there.  Maybe that'll help some of the pests to get through.  Spoofcard.com.  God damn it. 
[02:52:30]  These guys are killing the site.  We can't look at half these pictures now.  Oh, they don't.  They don't.  What?  They don't do a pumpkin drop.  Oh, my God.  Please tell me it's under the belly of a pregnant woman.  Then at least you have a bit.  Lamont and Tonelli greeting pumpkin destruction lovers.  Fall weather for a day, then it's straight into winter.  I can't see the pictures, though.  Everyone's killing the site.  Yeah.  Sully complains about the weather from 100 feet up. 
[02:53:00]  Does he?  Sully's a fucking cunt.  Can we hear his voice?  I don't know what he sounds like.  Yeah, what does he say?  We have sound of these guys.  I got to hear them so much already.  I know.  Just by their pictures.  And the fact that they stole fucking Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  Yeah.  And they claim that fucking Susie Greenberg, who was the girl who did that for the show,  who I'm still friends with, the nerve of them to claim that is theirs.  If we could get audio from anyone who has audio of those fucking cocksuckers claiming 
[02:53:30]  that's theirs, we'd love to play that.  I know it's old, but what the hey?  Dirty Friday is prank phone calls.  Of course it is.  All right, here's any of those things you're not allowed to do anymore.  They do a feature called Naked News.  Here's more Naked News.  Homeless guy washes clothes naked.  Sully, we may have your next impossible mission.  I love looking at some of the news stories in the morning because you never know what  you might run across.  And sometimes there's a story of something that happens to somebody. 
[02:54:00]  You're like, that could be a Sully's impossible mission.  Yeah.  This is from New Zealand, so we kind of go down under for this one.  Oh, my God.  Where a homeless man was arrested for attempting to clean his clothes in a coin laundromat,  which is really not a problem.  Okay.  The only problem was 45-year-old Kenneth Jorgensen didn't have a spare set of clothes,  so he stripped naked in the laundromat and put his clothes in the washer while he was drinking  a 40-ouncer in a brown paper bag while he washed his clothes.  We could send you down to the sit and spin. 
[02:54:30]  The sit and spin down in the Castro.  Yeah.  And have you strip naked and wash your clothes.  Is that E.T. laughing?  No, that's...  Police dispatches.  It was that guy standing there in the bare-skinned coat with the one button on it.  What is Step and Fetch it doing?  I don't laugh.  Oh, Lord, mercy.  Oh, you guys are silly. 
[02:55:00]  He should be fucking tap-dancing down steps behind Shirley Temple.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hi-di-hi-di-hi-di-hi.  Oh, let me tell you a story about Mindy the Moocher.  You should be fucking scatting, laughing and slapping your fist.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Couldn't afford the clothes.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, we got Billy on the line.  Phony radio voices.  Billy?  No, Billy Baroo.  Billy?  Hey, you're on.  Billy.  Billy, speak. 
[02:55:30]  You're on.  Gotta pop some monarchy jokes for you.  What?  Gotta pop some monarchy jokes for you.  Okay.  What do elderly women taste like?  What?  Depends.  Punch it out.  Yeah.  That's what they would do all morning.  Yeah, and then they have to find one that makes them laugh.  You want to hear a production bit, everybody?  This is a music bed.  How about we go with Preparation H&R Block?  Oh, God. 
[02:56:00]  That's like a hemorrhoid thing combined with a tax agency.  I don't know where this is going.  This is like two different things jammed together.  It's got to be historical.  I bet you they play this around November 15th.  Well, let's give a listen, ball.  Yeah, tax time.  You mean April 15th?  Yeah.  No, but that was the joke.  Oh.  The obvious was April 15th.  Sorry.  Oh.  They have the, by the way, they're two fucking phony radio voice guys.  Yep.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  We're going to...  There it is.  We're going to go down under here for this one.  So anyway, I go for my root canal yesterday.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  And today, because I haven't...  I've tried to start my taxes.  Have you done your taxes yet?  Have you even attempted this?  Oh, you know what?  All I did was send all of the information to the accountant, and he's working on...  I'll tell you what.  We have a salute here to an accountant.  To the hardworking professionals.  Oh, they save a lot of people at this time of the year.  Who are working on your taxes.  God bless the accountant.  And making it possible for you to get those deductions.  Here we go. 
[02:57:00]  Are you a tax accountant with hemorrhoids?  You can say that again.  Then try new Preparation H&R Block.  Oh, during tax season, I sit on my bottom line 12, 15 hours a day.  Oh, my God.  I sure couldn't do that without Preparation H&R Block.  The IRS audited my client for over 60 hours last week.  Thanks to Preparation H&R Block, I sat through the whole thing.  Not one hitch.  Get new Preparation H&R Block.  Because everyone knows taxes can be a real pain in the butt.  There you go.  Brand new product. 
[02:57:30]  Just in time for this time of the year.  I'm sure it comes in handy.  And they can't even say pain in the ass.  They can't even commit.  Oh, my God.  That's who's fucking bashing this show?  That is who is doing well in San Francisco?  Are they?  It's probably either that or listen to the sound of children being fucked.  What could possibly be losing to that competitively?  That is...  Good times.  Let's go.  Awful material.  Derek in California.  Derek.  Awful.  Hey, I was just going to say, before I got XM, I used to listen to them. 
[02:58:00]  And some guy called up a few months ago and asked them why they got...  Why didn't you whip them out Wednesday?  Because they did it on the old radio station.  And they said the only reason why they went to Talk Tattoos is because of a contractual issue with the old radio station.  So these fuckers ripped off our wow promotion and they're not allowed to bring it to their new station because now it's property of their old station.  These fucking whores.  They never mention you guys at all.  What's their old station?  Oh, don't worry.  They'll be mentioning us.  Trust me on that. 
[02:58:30]  What's their old station?  They were on San Jose, KSJO.  Okay.  If anybody has any information on that, it'd be great.  Let's say hi to us.  Apparently, Norton and Voss are friends on the Lamont and Telly.  Lamont and Telly.  On their MySpace.  Are we?  Yeah, you're on their friend.  Good for us.  Anthony wants to sing his girlfriend, Lisa, this morning on Dirty Friday.  He said they went for lunch earlier on this week.  Is there a live show happening right now?  Like that night, his girlfriend had a very upset stomach and thought maybe it was the food that he ate. 
[02:59:00]  And he said they had the exact same thing.  So it couldn't have been.  Maybe she just came down with something.  He said she's a bit of a hypochondriac, though.  Why don't you have some fun with her?  Give us all the details.  And here's the detail I like.  She ended up paying for it.  I said, well, you know, that's a beautiful thing.  Yep.  Is it a prank phone call they're going into?  It's a credit card.  It's only got that info here, too.  This is a good way to sing somebody on Dirty Friday when they're dealing with something like this. 
[02:59:30]  No, that would be Dirty Friday.  Oh, prank call.  Call coming up.  Great.  What's your name again?  What's up?  We're listening.  Just put the thing there and shut up.  Well, that's a wife's name.  You didn't hear it.  Yeah.  Oh, is that my wife's name?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hi, Lisa.  Please.  Yes, this is Lisa.  Hi, Lisa.  Officer Kumpstein calling from the.  Kumpstein.  They did not just go with Officer Kumpstein. 
[03:00:00]  Your name came up on an investigation we're doing on a local restaurant.  Did you eat at a.  On Monday?  Yes.  I was.  Now, when you ate at the restaurant, did you notice any ill effects from the food at all?  We're looking at their MySpace comments that a few of the listeners may have gotten to.  What exactly did you experience?  I had stomach cramps and diarrhea. 
[03:00:30]  We don't even need to listen to that right now.  By the way, those are all fake.  Yeah.  That's a big call.  I'm not allowed to do them anymore.  Prank call.  Prank call.  This is so fucking funny.  The ONA pass have attacked their MySpace page.  And it's nothing but horrific photographs.  Guys getting in the ass by horses.  Guys blowing each other.  Big fat girl.  They got a fat woman bent on all fours.  A muscular gentleman.  A lot of gay porno. 
[03:01:00]  A corpse.  I'm blowing a dude.  Slow down.  A girl getting up to poop shoot from a horse.  Wow.  The pests have just gone to town on that site.  Good one.  That's really, really funny.  All right.  Well.  They're going to get their fucking heads kicked in.  Doug, what's up? 
[03:01:30]  Yo.  Hey.  So you're done, Doug?  Actually, I had something more about the spoof tell.  Yeah.  The spoofing the telephone numbers thing.  Yeah.  Okay.  Those of them don't work with 888 numbers.  So you got to...  Oh, damn it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually dropped like 10 bucks buying a spoof tell this morning.  And then I made the call.  And it says it doesn't work with 888 numbers.  So we're finding one.  And we're also going to try to find a local number, too.  Because they're aggravating me with this.  All right.  You guys will overcome. 
[03:02:00]  Of course you will.  It's the first day.  Don't be discouraged, son.  MySpace looks great, though.  Oh, dude.  Fantastic.  Please keep hitting that MySpace.  Watch how they delete it or just take it down.  We will affect them.  Oh, they will mention us.  They will be affected.  Which will only help the cause in San Francisco.  If you take a look at the first couple of posts on the MySpace, it's actually by somebody  else.  But there's screen caps of mine that they deleted last night.  Oh, really?  So, yeah.  We're reposting the screen caps over and over to confuse them a little bit more. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  You're a good boy.  What are we promoting today, Doug?  FullblownAids.com?  Yeah, sure.  Whackbag.  We're doing a softball game on Sunday.  If anybody wants to find the information on that, it's on FullblownAids.  We're doing a POW talk, a get-together, Boston versus New York, to see, because everybody  always argues about the Sox and the Yankees, so we're doing the game.  Where are you playing?  We're playing right across New York State there.  I don't know the exact location. 
[03:03:00]  It's on the website.  I stink.  That's all right.  We got that.  And check out the Pest booth at the PNC.  We're going to have a lot of stuff this time.  We're buying t-shirts this time to give out.  Okay.  And someone on the other show was asking how they become a pest, and I was going to answer  that call and just say, pests know how to become pests.  You just are.  It's like saying, how do I become Italian?  Yeah.  You just go to the websites.  If you have that kind of personality, then that's what's going to happen.  Hey, the MySpace, it's, I forgot, Opie and Anthony Pest? 
[03:03:30]  Yes, sir.  P-E-S-T-S, right?  Yep.  Spelt out completely.  Opie and Anthony Pest.  All right.  That's their MySpace.  All right.  I got to put you guys in my top eight.  Doug, we'll talk later.  I want to know the email you guys are using, so I could put you in my top eight.  No problem.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Are they still on?  Or Montanelli?  877-G-TEAM-2020.  Call now and see the best.  The SBT Yellow Pages is trying to...  ...the military commercials.  We'll go back to that.  Of course.  Hey, Bill Burr was on our show, I think, Friday.  And he was promoting his thing on Comedy Central, live from Gotham. 
[03:04:00]  Yes.  We got his little stand-up here.  Ooh.  So we'll play this as we go on a break.  It's about, I don't know, four or five minutes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Four or five minutes.  All right.  And then we'll continue with more...  Do they have his intro?  I don't know.  Do they have a big intro?  I don't know.  Let's listen in.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Pace yourselves.  For Christ's sake.  Watching the History Channel today, right? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, this whole, like, three-hour special on Adolf Hitler, you know?  Here's a question for you.  How come you never run into anybody with the last name Hitler?  You know what I'm saying?  That guy didn't have any relatives.  You know, he didn't have, like, a cousin.  Like, Ed.  You know, Ad Hitler, he's a plumber, right?  He's a...  Shows up to work on time.  Your little lady covers for you.  You know he had relatives.  They all had to change their last names.  I'm fascinated with that level of evil, right? 
[03:05:00]  Like, you're so evil, they have to retire your name.  Like, that's it.  It's over.  Shut it down.  They just take your name out of that baby book list of names.  Just erase it.  Think about it.  For the rest of the time, no one's going to have a beautiful baby.  Be like, you want to call him Adolf?  Is everybody cool with that?  Can you imagine?  No, thank you.  Can you...  Can you imagine being that much of a d***o? 
[03:05:30]  Like, whatever your name is, the day you die.  Steve, that's it.  No more Steves.  Do you see that, dude?  There's only a few names in history like that, right?  Like, nobody has a friend named Attila, right?  Anybody hanging out with their buddy Judas tonight?  You're not.  And that's a cool name.  You set up one Messiah to die, that's it.  It's over.  They're having, like, the retirement ceremony.  They're bringing your jersey up to the rafters.  You're standing baseline with a bunch of other psychos, 
[03:06:00]  getting high fives and stuff.  It's a weird grading system, though.  You know what I mean?  Because look at a guy like Jeffrey Dahmer, man.  That guy murdered and ate over, like, 30 people.  People are still calling their babies Jeffrey.  He must have been pissed.  It's like, dude, how many people do I got to eat  to get a little damn respect around here?  Anybody can kill him, I'm eating him.  Ooh, you stabbed him.  Fire up the grill.  Taking this to a whole nother level. 
[03:06:30]  Realize, man, I've been real empty lately.  I never go to church, man.  I gotta be honest, I hate church.  I always couldn't stand it when I was growing up.  Yeah, there's a couple other people going to hell with me.  Ah, there you go.  No.  You know what it is?  I grew up Catholic.  I used to sit there in the crowd, you know,  listening to the priests.  The priests, they were, like, preaching.  They didn't even sound like they believed it.  They'd just be up there,  this is the gospel, according to Luke.  All right?  I'm not saying it happened. 
[03:07:00]  I'm not saying it didn't happen, all right?  I'm just saying what Luke said.  Now, according to Luke, the dude got out of the boat,  he started walking across the water.  Ah!  It started crazy to me.  I don't know if he was a drinker.  You know, don't get mad at me.  I'm just repeating what Luke said.  What Luke said.  No, I definitely, I believe in a higher power,  but I think when people just get too into religion,  they get crazy.  Like, I like people,  and they, like, they get so into it  that they actually, like, argue, like,  what color Jesus is.  You know what I mean? 
[03:07:30]  Which is hilarious.  That's, like, one of the most unholy  things you could ever do, right?  They'll sit down and be like,  you know, Jesus, he's for everybody.  Rich people, poor people,  he doesn't care.  He's just,  he's just a great spirit.  Everything's great.  Oh, yeah?  What color is he?  He's white!  He looks like me!  We are chosen people!  You know?  Or,  some of my, uh,  some of my black friends 
[03:08:00]  tried to convince me  that Jesus was black  and with that nappy head,  all this stuff, you know?  It's the dumbest thing to argue about.  I really don't give a shit  what color Jesus is.  I just don't want him to be mad at me  when he comes back.  That's my deal.  I don't care what he is  when he comes back  on that seven-headed horse  chopping people's heads off,  whatever the hell it is.  I just want when he rides by me,  you know,  just give me one of these.  Make me feel good about my life,  you know?  So,  I've been doing this 
[03:08:30]  for quite a while now, man.  I've got to be honest with you, man.  I just want to make a zillion bucks.  You know?  Go home,  stare at the wall,  you know?  So, I actually came up  with a scheme, right?  I'm going to quit doing  this comedy stuff.  I'm going to write a book  on, like, relationships,  you know?  My girl's always watching  that Oprah show.  I'm so obscene.  People love reading  about relationships.  I'm going to write a book on it.  It's called  Women Are Absolutely Right.  Right?  Chapter one's going to be  Women Are S**t.  You know?  Chapter two,  if guys just listen to women,  there'll be no war.  Right?  Then in the back of the book,  I'll have, like, 
[03:09:00]  a picture of me  in, like,  a turtleneck sweater  with, like,  the gayest look ever,  just like...  You know?  So, I look like  I really understand women.  And then,  a bunch of women  will go out  and buy the book.  And they'll take it home  to their boyfriend  or their husband.  You see that?  Look at that.  A guy wrote this.  You really need to read this.  Meanwhile,  I make a zillion dollars,  right?  I go out,  I buy a big house,  I get some whores,  I fly them all in,  get them all tested,  just start banging away, 
[03:09:30]  right?  And then right in the middle  of humping one of them,  you take a picture  for next year's book  called,  Ah, you stupid bitches.  Then all the guys buy it.  Yeah.  And they take it home  to their girlfriend  or their wife.  Ah, you see that?  That's the guy  in the turtleneck sweater.  You financed this.  Keep yourselves going.  Another round of applause.  Oh, s***.  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's affected. 
[03:10:00]  That's right, O.P.  Hey, s***.  You f***ing shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature  of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals  rot off.  Whoa, dude,  don't come near me.  We're your celebrity  skin cancer connection.  And it was better  than my first kiss.  Oh, laugh until your energy  spill out on the chair.  I'm Anthony Show.  On the bell door  Got my fist on 
[03:10:30]  On the bell door  Got to thank Baby Girl  on Pal Talk.  Oh, my God.  Giving everybody a little bit  of a show during  commercial break.  She's very lovely.  She stood up to flash  her bosoms.  And when she did it,  she has these little  pink short shorts on.  And the only thing  I can think to say  is it's just lovely.  Like, I don't even  want to be dirty.  I just want to say,  my, you have a lovely figure. 
[03:11:00]  A lovely figure.  And when she says  thank you,  I put my face in her shoes  and I jerk off  on my legs.  Again.  Hey, Brett in Indiana.  What's up today?  Hey, new listener  to you guys.  Yeah.  You guys are cracking me up.  Thanks, Brett.  Hey, Brett.  I'm also a Sirius.  I don't like radio, too.  I got it.  Yeah.  And all I hear  is that Howard Stern bullshit.  Yeah, Brett,  what do you like  about our show? 
[03:11:30]  Well.  I love when they  just start listening.  It's like a mile away.  John in San Francisco.  What's up, John?  Hey, this is John.  I was wondering.  I'm out here in California.  I was wondering  if there's anything  I could do to get  these two fucks  over at the bone.  Well, if you're in  San Francisco,  I guess you could call  and get through.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see  if they're real  broadcasters.  And then when you get through,  why don't you acknowledge  that we're beating  the crap out of you? 
[03:12:00]  Say something silly.  Okay, well, hey,  I had an idea, okay?  They have this, you know,  Dirty Friday shit.  Oh, yeah.  Is there a way  maybe we might be able  to pull a little  Dirty Friday on them?  You know,  seeing that I'm out here,  I got a local phone number  and a whole deal.  You know,  maybe I could get a hold  of Doug at Doug  or something on MySpace  and we could run  something for him  on Friday  that he ain't expecting.  Cool.  What is Dirty Friday?  Somebody brings a pussy  into the studio  and they all go yuck 
[03:12:30]  and they all run around  the room  like they saw a mouse.  They'll jump on a chair  until somebody comes  and shoos it away.  Dirty Friday down here  is what they do  is they have somebody  call up, okay,  and they like  play a joke  on somebody  they'll call up  they'll pretend  they're a cop  or whatever  or somebody  they'll check out  of a hotel  and they'll see  that they found  Doug in the hotel  or shit like that.  The problem is  they record  those prank calls  so there's no way  we can get them.  Notice where the beeps are.  Notice where the beeps are.  How do they beep  if it's a live call 
[03:13:00]  every time she says something?  How do they know  where they beep?  It's not live, stop.  It's totally illegal  to do that.  You can't call  and put somebody  on the radio  who doesn't know  they're on the radio.  It's illegal.  So they're fucking  froze.  They're live.  I'm sorry, John.  We'll figure it out.  Alright, man.  Hey, love you guys.  Hope you bring  the virus out to California.  We're waiting for you.  You already got  some nice viruses  out there, sir.  Exactly.  Have a good one, man.  Thanks, sweet potato.  Alright.  Kevin Smith  mentions O&A  at Comic-Con.  Oh, yeah?  Comic-Con. 
[03:13:30]  Comic-Con.  Comic-Con.  Comic-Con.  Let's see what  this is about.  But it was weird, man.  I grew up  watching that dude  on TV.  Like, he was our...  Alright, he's talking  about the problem  he had with  Joel Siegel  over Clerks 2.  Wouldn't it be funny  if he just trashed us  and I was trying  to talk to Joel  and those fucking  hacks kept  that are up to me?  Yeah.  But it was weird, man.  It's like,  I grew up  watching that dude  on TV.  Like, he was our  critic growing up 
[03:14:00]  and whatnot.  He's got this big  fucking goofy mustache  and he...  I was on  Opie and Anthony  the other day  and I wound up  getting into a fight  with him on the phone  and they were like,  you want to call  Joel Siegel?  I was like,  yeah, that'd be great.  They're like,  we got his number.  How'd you guys do that?  And they're like,  we're Opie and Anthony.  So we called him up  and I got into him  and it was one  of the rare times  that I got to  kind of confront  somebody that  didn't like my shit  and I didn't care  that he walked out.  I get that, you know,  whatever I do  is not everybody's  brand of whimsy  but to be, like,  disruptive  when you walk out,  you know, 
[03:14:30]  in the middle  of a press screen  was just horrible  and the dude  was kind of like  fucking,  he thought he was  Jared McGuire  like leaving the screen  and he's like,  who's with me?  That's funny.  That's really funny.  That's funny.  Way to go.  Kevin Smith,  thanks for the mention.  Cool.  All right,  we can finally play  the grandma  pens off Attacker  on CNN.  God love her.  Hey, I want to thank,  yeah,  I want to thank  Point Blank.  They rocked F.H. Riley's  over the weekend.  I heard. 
[03:15:00]  It was a good showing  and the band  is great.  Point Blank  is this band  on Long Island  and they're  really, really good.  Playing the Judas Priest  and the Metallica  and the little Slayer.  They do all covers?  No,  and then they got  their own stuff  and they did  like a version  of Sweet Caroline.  They're really good.  Ripping me off.  And all the Huntington locals,  you know,  they're kind of snobby.  They're walking by the joint  going,  what the hell is going on?  What's going on here?  Because we pretty much  turned it into a metal club  for the night.  Yeah.  We're trying everything  over there  and I guess Friday 
[03:15:30]  they're having some kind  of wedding reception  at F.H. Riley's.  Does anyone know about this?  I don't even think  my brother knows about this.  You better call my brother  because I don't know  if he knows about this.  All I know,  I just know a few vague things,  is that through  the message board,  I believe,  through Wack Bag  or something,  one of these  get-togethers  that happen  at F.H. Riley's,  a couple of people met,  hooked up,  went and eloped,  got married,  you know, 
[03:16:00]  and they didn't have  like a formal  type reception thing  so they want to do that  at F.H. Riley's.  And the kicker is  Master Poe,  I believe,  will be the emcee  and him  and my sister Dawn,  who are now  the new carpenters,  are going to be singing  the wedding song  and everything.  What?  These are just  some of the vague  bits of information  I'm getting.  I hear like  your future brother-in-law  is like going to be  the photographer. 
[03:16:30]  He's going to be  the photographer?  Well, he's very good.  He's a very good photographer  so he's going to be  taking the pictures  and Poe and my sister  are going to be singing.  I hope she falls  in love with Poe.  You think my sister  falls in love with Poe?  I hope so.  No offense to the guy  she's dating.  He leaves Patrick  for Master Poe.  I hope so.  I don't know.  I hope so.  I hope you have  little nieces and nephews  that all talk like Poe.  Let me tell you  I love Poe like a brother.  Me and him  when we walk to the truck  we chat about life  things in general  very nice  but let me tell you something  Hold on. 
[03:17:00]  My sister brings  a Puerto Rican home  it's over.  Attaboy.  It's over.  Put your foot down.  You don't talk to him.  You watch TV  on your cell phone.  We say a couple of words  to each other.  Stop it.  Like what?  It's a couple of  Hi.  How are you doing?  How about the last  conversation you had  with Master Poe  as he's protecting you?  I say Poe the light's green  let's go.  There you go.  I say other things  Me and Poe chat  very friendly.  It goes like this  So  gonna have a good weekend 
[03:17:30]  Anthony  and you go  I hope so  and he goes  ha  ha  ha  That is not  Me and Poe  have some  great discussions  on the short walk  to my vehicle.  No.  You see  he thinks somebody  threw a brick at you  and he realizes  it's just your wallet.  Ha ha  Paul we have  little chats  on the way to  on the way  to the truck  right?  All the time.  Discuss little things.  Now what's this thing?  Now what's going on  at FH Riley's?  There's a reception?  Yes there's a reception.  Two of my students  Mike and Heather Smith

What happened there?  I believe that was.  Made by Brian M.  Brian M is a faggot.  That's right.  If you wanted to hear us  saying those things in that context.  What you got there? 
[03:22:30]  This guy wants to say goodbye.  Let's say hi to Glenn.  Hey Glenn.  Oh no.  Hey guys, what's going on?  Hey there, Glenn.  Hello, Glennie.  Hey, I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys  because I'm going down to Fort Gordon, Georgia  for about 13 weeks to finish up my army training  and I can't listen to you guys, so.  Fort Gordon, Georgia.  We're available there.  Well, I don't think I'll be able to listen to a radio.  Tell the Sarge you got your XM  and you want to have a few laughs  and that's that. 
[03:23:00]  He doesn't like it?  Lump it.  They respond.  They do.  They like it when you're free thinking.  Sarge, I don't compromise for no one.  That's right.  I have to listen to my XM every day.  I'm not getting up for the morning run, Sarge,  because I'm having a few laughs.  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart.  I'm not done listening to O&A, Sarge.  That's right, Sarge.  Is that good enough for you?  Why don't you wait outside by the barracks  and puff a cock while I'm having a few laughs?  You asshole. 
[03:23:30]  Are you about to call me an asshole?  No, I did call you an asshole.  That's right.  I was about to call you a shit dick  and you interrupted, Sarge.  You had best unfuck yourself  or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck.  Whatever, Sarge.  I double dare you.  Well, yeah, Godspeed.  What are you doing?  First time in?  What?  Basic training?  What?  I already did basic training.  It's called a split option thing.  So I did basic last summer 
[03:24:00]  and I'm doing my job training this summer.  Are you a Navy SEAL in the Army?  What are you in for?  Communications?  Exactly.  I'm a radio operator.  Everyone's a radio guy in the Army.  So this guy's the green brain in the Army.  Am I right or wrong?  So they give him a fucking gun and send him out.  Everyone's calm.  My brother, same thing.  Communications.  What do they have them do?  Fucking dropping out of an airplane.  Everyone starts thinking they're going to be a radio guy.  I know.  That's the guy in the back, right?  Just sit there with the fucking thing and go, 
[03:24:30]  I want to call in an airstrike.  No.  Here's a gun.  Get up front, radio man.  That's right.  You're being shot at.  Yell 10-4.  All right, Glenn.  Good luck to you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye, pumpkin.  Good luck.  Well, we lost a listener today.  No, no, no, no.  Only temporary.  He'll be back.  Dave in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I saw some pictures of the last karaoke night.  Yeah.  And there was a woman singing with Master Poe.  Yep.  Is that Anthony's sister?  Yes. 
[03:25:00]  She is so fucking hot.  Hey, now.  She is, dude.  If you think she's hot, you've got to see Aunt's mom.  Don't you?  Where the jeans cut from, my friend.  About my sister's tits?  Jesus.  Oh, this is so nice.  Sir.  Got to go.  Sir.  I mean, to say something like that, it's not disrespectful.  There's a compliment.  I watched them when they were just little nubs grow into the massive melons they are now.  They really are.  Very proud of my sister's tits.  Two luscious teardrops. 
[03:25:30]  What man wouldn't enjoy them?  I remember when she sprouted Lil Hershey's Kisses.  And then before you know it, she had vavoom.  Big hands.  It's like, Dawn, what happened?  I can't wrestle with you no more.  Please, that's when you should have started.  She used to do this thing.  It was called Messy Girl.  We used to play a game called Messy Girl.  Oh, no.  No, no.  It was because when she was a kid, like all kids do, I guess she grabbed into the toilet and grabbed a little nugget out of crap. 
[03:26:00]  And she had crap on her hands and was walking around the house.  And me and my brother were just like, ah, you know, screaming, running away from her.  And she was just kind of walking around and we were petrified.  So we would call her Messy Girl.  And then any time we said Messy Girl, she'd like chase us around the house like she actually had the shit on her hands.  And we would have to run and hide under the covers and try not to let her touch us. 
[03:26:30]  But then after, you know, she sprouted, all those games went to hell.  But then dad would come home and you all would just shower together.  Nah, that was after the showering.  Cleaned up all the filth and you were all right again.  That was after the showering.  She'd make a little sound when she was Messy Girl.  She'd go, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, and chase us around the house and try to touch us.  It was very frightening.  What happened when you became old?  And then she blossomed and no more Messy Girl.  No more Messy Girl.  And then you changed and you'd make her play Nazi Girl. 
[03:27:00]  And she'd have to chase you around with a copy of the Old Testament and a yarmulke and you'd hide.  Oh no, I was just, I was innocent, I was helping.  I am essential to the war effort.  Is Doran going to defend herself today?  Um, I don't know.  She's probably working.  She actually works for a living.  You do have very attractive women in your family.  Yeah.  Ooh.  The mom.  Hey now.  Bro.  Uh.  I just think of her as my mom.  Who's this?  Where'd he die?  Who?  Where'd he die? 
[03:27:30]  Remember me?  Alright.  Let's talk about.  I called you up on K-Rock before.  She's been drinking.  Who?  Oh wow, right?  Listen.  Yeah, I called you up on the other radio station that you're at right now.  Someone's been drinking.  How you doing guys?  Hey.  Wait, who is this?  Lady Di.  Radi-I?  Who the hell is Radi-I?  Lady.  Lady Cry.  Who's crying?  I don't know who Radi-I is.  Diana. 
[03:28:00]  What do you got, Radi-I?  How you doing, hon?  You a first time listener?  First time caller?  Long time listener?  I'm a long time listener.  I've known you guys for six years already.  Come on.  Six years.  Six years.  Who is this?  Radi-I.  Where are you from, Radi-I?  You been drinking?  No, I have not.  Wow.  Has her pants burst into flames.  Hey, waste of life. 
[03:28:30]  Excuse me, I'm not a waste of life.  Hey, waste of life.  Why aren't you at work?  I'm not working right now.  Why?  They don't need me today.  Oh.  They don't need me today.  So you take the day off.  You're broke, you're homeless, your kid is living with someone else.  Eh, yeah, why bother working?  They don't need you today?  How's that working a warehouse job?  I wish I could say that.  Ah, you know, I didn't go to work today.  They didn't need me.  They didn't need me today.  Why not?  Who are you, fucking Terry and on the waterfront? 
[03:29:00]  You show up at the docks every day?  No, I'm not fucking Terry.  Shut up, cunt, I'm talking.  All right, hold on.  And if Johnny Friendly needs you, he fucking waves you over.  I'm fucking Terry, not right now.  All right, shut up.  Listen to this bitch.  I'm going to call you out on something.  Who's Terry from the docks there, Lady Di?  You said, no, I'm not Terry from the docks.  Like, you knew exactly what Jimmy was talking about.  So why don't you explain what Terry from the docks means?  Terry from the docks?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Yeah, I have no idea.  It's from a movie.  You know who you are? 
[03:29:30]  You're cunt from the...  Because you are a disgusting fat body, Private Pile.  Lady Di.  Jim.  Yes, baby.  What?  When you know that you're going to die, can you at least call our show so we can make it  into some interesting radio?  What did you have to drink so far this morning?  Don't lie.  You sound intoxicated.  Don't lie.  I'm not intoxicated right now.  What did you have?  More than three or less than three?  I had coffee this morning. 
[03:30:00]  What did you have with alcohol in it so far today?  Don't lie.  No.  No.  You're lying.  You're lying.  We hear it in your voice.  You can hear it.  You can hear it, you dummy.  Give me your roommate right now.  No.  I want to hit on her.  I want to hit on her.  No.  No.  My roommate's not home right now.  You've been drinking.  You've been drinking.  You had at least one.  Lady Di, if you're not going to be honest with us, then...  Oh, okay. 
[03:30:30]  Okay.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I did have a couple of drinks.  All right.  Then why did you just lie?  Why lie?  You know, because I don't want to make myself look like an ass.  Well, you're not proud of it.  Then you know it's wrong, because you're lying about it.  So why don't you just not drink?  Sir.  What?  It's a hard thing to do.  Now your son's not worth it.  Your son's not worth it.  Your son's not worth it. 
[03:31:00]  It's a hard thing to do.  Where are you, mommy?  Where are you, mommy?  Where's your mother?  Oh, she's drunk.  Why doesn't my mommy come to see me?  She doesn't take care of me.  Who's your son calling mommy these days?  Yeah.  My son right now is my father.  Right.  Well, he has to call your father daddy, because that didn't work out too well.  So someone else has to be mommy.  So who's his fake mommy?  Who's a fake mommy?  Yeah.  Who has to do all the heavy lifting for you as you drink yourself to death? 
[03:31:30]  As you drink in the morning.  Oh, my God.  You know, this poor kid.  What selfish motherfuckers he has for parents.  What selfish motherfuckers.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Your husband was a selfish cunt for killing himself, and you're a selfish cunt for drinking  yourself to death.  Neither one of you thinks about this fucking kid.  You're awful parents.  He's a bum for not thinking about his son, and you're a bum.  Hold on one second.  You're a bum. 
[03:32:00]  Thanks for unleashing what will be a disaster of a human being into society.  A criminal, a rapist, a fucking pedophile.  Whatever he grows up into, it's going to be something fucked up that society has to deal  with because you are an asshole.  Selfish bitch.  No, it's not.  Two selfish, shit-dick parents.  No, you're absolutely wrong about this.  Yeah, really?  Really?  When was the last time you saw your son?  Right now, my son's going to be a decent kid.  Maybe we are. 
[03:32:30]  Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, too.  It's not your son that's the problem.  I feel bad for him because he has two shitty, selfish parents.  What do you think he does when people are talking about their parents?  Where are your parents?  Well, my dad kissed a train and mom's drinking.  Jim, Jim.  Yeah.  Stop.  Go ahead, drunk.  Does your father have to take him to Chuck E. Cheese on Mother's Day to make him forget?  Dad, look at all the other mommies there with their kids, knowing that his mommy is in a bottle somewhere.  My dad, no, my dad is a pretty good dad. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, you're just, your dad is, but your husband was a bum and you're a bum.  How good could your dad be?  He fucking raised you and look at the disaster you turned into.  How many times does your dad have to sit, you know, your son down and go, well, she said she'd be here.  I'll be stopped.  You miss his birthday?  We all have one of you in our lives and we fucking hate you.  When's his birthday?  You don't hate me.  When's his birthday?  You know that.  He does hate you.  When's your son's birthday?  July 11th.  July 11th. 
[03:33:30]  Did you go?  Did you see him?  No.  No, I did not see him.  You didn't see him on his birthday?  On his fucking birthday.  Is mommy coming to see me on my birthday?  Well, she said she'd stop by.  Your fucking son goes to bed crying.  Why didn't you see him on his birthday?  No, he did not.  Why didn't you see him?  He knows.  He knows my situation.  Why didn't you see him on his birthday?  He knows your selfish situation. 
[03:34:00]  Why didn't you see him?  Wait, what'd you tell him?  And Lady Di, let me make this perfectly clear, by the way.  Let me make this perfectly clear, Lady Di.  I do hate you.  I absolutely hate you.  And why didn't you tell him?  Look, I'd love to come, but I'm blowing a homeless guy or I'm drinking.  She goes, you don't know how it's like to have kids.  You don't either, obviously.  Yeah, obviously, you don't.  Hey, Lady Di, why didn't you see your son on his birthday? 
[03:34:30]  Answer.  Answer.  Okay.  Your phone's crapping out.  Your phone's crapping out.  Your phone's crapping out, you whore.  Why?  How does hobo come taste?  Why didn't you see your son?  Hello?  Oh, I didn't do that.  No, the phone crapped out.  What a fucking bum she is.  What a fucking selfish bitch.  They didn't need me today. 
[03:35:00]  So I'll start drinking.  And fuck the husband, too.  Killing himself while he has a kid to care for.  Selfish jerk-off.  Look, you know, addiction obviously is a tough thing.  Of course it is.  I understand that.  But this bitch, man, she's been calling us for who knows how long.  And she doesn't even give it the old...  People trying to help her.  She doesn't even give it a try.  Doesn't even try.  We've all tried to help her.  I'm not going to sit there and say addiction's easy to freaking beat.  But this bitch doesn't even try.  Nope.  She doesn't even see it.  She's a self-centered asshole who doesn't care that her kid is fucking growing up without a mother. 
[03:35:30]  She's a bum.  See how long she lied before she fessed up to drinking?  It's like you could hear it in her voice.  She can't fucking talk.  Lady Di.  How you doing, guys?  Why didn't you see your son?  I hate you because you don't even try.  No, I do try.  No, you don't.  You're not trying.  But why do you keep on bringing that stuff up?  Because why didn't you see your son for his birthday? 
[03:36:00]  I do see him for his birthday.  You just said you didn't see him for his birthday.  You said you didn't see him for his birthday.  You sent him a card.  Why didn't you go to see him?  No, you didn't go to Carolina for his birthday.  What?  With his aunt and uncle.  Why didn't you see him for his birthday?  Because he was in North Carolina.  He was what?  In North Carolina with his aunt and uncle.  And why was that?  I can't go to North Carolina.  He was there because you're not there for him. 
[03:36:30]  Does he live down there now?  No, he does not live that.  He lives here and lives there.  What do you think he does when other people's parents are picking them up from school  and taking them to school events and people say,  what about your parents?  What do you think he says?  Well, I...  No, no, no.  Answer me.  Answer.  Answer.  What do you think he says?  I have no idea what he says.  I have no idea what he says.  Well, take a guess, selfish.  Do you think he's crushed at the fact that he sees other mommies around and knows that  his is a piece of shit?  No.  Don't you think that crushes him? 
[03:37:00]  No, I'm not a piece of shit.  Do you think he's proud of you?  Well, he's not proud of me, but I'm not a piece of shit.  So you're an embarrassment and a source of shame for your own son.  That's got to feel good.  What would you call a mother that prefers drinking and sleeping with the homeless above taking  care of her own son?  What would you call that?  I got out of that already.  I got out of that already.  You're at a flop house, Di.  You're not working today.  You're not working.  You're drinking in the morning.  By the way, this is a very interesting thing coming in here. 
[03:37:30]  Christian from Oklahoma City.  Go ahead, Christian.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Sorry to put this kind of on a serious tip, but Jimmy, whenever you quit drinking, I mean,  was that really hard for you to kind of like hang out with people that were in NA?  And how did you do that?  Were they cool?  I mean, that's part of my problem is I don't want to go to NA because or NA and AA because  I don't consider those people cool.  Well, dude, when I quit drinking, shut up, Di. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Hold on one second.  Shut your mouth.  You know nothing about quitting.  I went to Jimmy.  When I quit, I was 18.  Three.  And I went to, I don't talk about what program I go to only because they request anonymity  and I respect that.  But let's just, I went to a meeting of a 12-step program.  And it was in a church basement on a Friday night.  And I was 18.  And my sponsor and my buddy, Mike, were talking about Imus in the morning.  And they were eating cheese and crackers.  And I'm thinking, my fucking life is over. 
[03:38:30]  And the more I got to know, Diane, shut your fucking mouth.  Shut up.  Shut your mouth.  You drunken twat.  Shut up.  I'm talking about spirituality.  Dude, the more I went, the more I got to know people, they were the same maniacs that  I fucking drank with, but they just weren't drinking and getting high anymore.  I had more fun with people who were sober than I ever had with people who were drinking, 
[03:39:00]  dude.  So, shut up.  I'm not talking to you.  I'm talking about how good my life is, you cunt.  So, what I suggest, dude, is you got to give being sober a shot.  I know it seems like life is over, but I was miserable and depressed and suicidal when  I was drinking.  And then I found this group of people who understood how I felt, and they understood me, and they  weren't like that anymore.  So, believe me.  What is cool?  What is cool?  Puking on yourself?  Your dick doesn't get hard because you're too drunk? 
[03:39:30]  I mean, what is cool?  Um, that is so nice.  Shut up, whore.  I'm talking about love and God, you fucking cunt.  Shut yourself.  Go ahead, buddy.  What do you suggest?  That is so not cool.  I'm not?  You're not cool sucking homeless dick with no ass.  You have a fucking homeless cum breath, and you have the ass of Nathaniel.  No offense, fan.  Go ahead, son.  What are you trying to say?  Would you suggest that my sponsor be someone, like, a lot older than me, or someone my same 
[03:40:00]  age?  I would personally suggest I chose a guy who was older than me.  They say it should be somebody who has what you want in an internal sense, a spiritual  sense.  Like, my gym, who was the guy that helped me, was a guy who I admired what he had.  I admired who he was, and I wanted to be like him.  Didn't you choose him, Big Hog?  Yeah, you chose him because he had good abs, right?  No, he was...  Give me, give me.  Hold on.  Excuse me.  Hey, cunt, I'm talking about love and compassion.  So drink yourself to death while I talk to this young man, you fucking sunless slob. 
[03:40:30]  And you have to want what they have spiritually.  And I think that's the key, is I wanted the serenity he had.  He handled situations the way I would want to, and I guess the way I've come to.  Like, I handle adversity now with diplomacy, and I handle it subtly, and I try to be a different  person than I used to be.  Jimmy, one more question.  Did it work for you the first time?  My first time...  Hold on.  Cut your own throat and bleed to death, you fucking tequila worm-eating pig. 
[03:41:00]  The first time, son, I was actually...  Hold on.  Shut up, you drunken pig.  Sobriety's not for you.  Get a rope and a fucking stool and a really solid beam, fatso.  The first time I was actually sent into rehab after a suicide attempt, when I was 17.  And I didn't want to be there.  So I drank into rehab, and I drank a year after.  I wasn't ready.  When I finally decided, February 1st of 87, that I had to stop, I did it for myself. 
[03:41:30]  I did it for the right reasons.  And I did make it.  So the first time I truly tried, I made it.  But a lot of times, dude, people don't make it the first time.  Just keep coming back.  You help people.  If you go out and use, and you come back and talk to people, believe me, you help them.  You show them what they have to watch out for.  Like, you know, they say Robin Williams just drank after 20 years of not drinking.  You know what?  I got like 19 years of not drinking.  If it can happen to him, it can happen to me. 
[03:42:00]  He has everything I want.  He's a great actor.  He's a fucking rich, successful dude.  I mean, I want what he has, and yet he risked throwing it away.  So if he could fuck up, I could fuck up.  So don't feel bad.  Just come back.  Yeah, I'm on my second time.  It's only my third day.  I'm having some real problems with it.  Well, get a sponsor, somebody you respect, and talk to that person, and just be honest with them, dude.  Believe me, if it didn't get easier, I never would have made it.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I'm going to punch out now.  All right, good luck, man. 
[03:42:30]  But definitely stick with it.  All right, thanks.  Christian from Oklahoma City.  Hold on, shut your fucking filthy booze hole while I'm talking about spirituality and helping a sick and suffering person.  You fucking oinker.  No, no, no, I'm not a fucking oinker.  You are a fucking oinker.  You would upgrade to fucking oinker.  Right now, you're a homeless booze whore with flat ass and hobo cum breath.  You're not even a fucking oinker.  You're Lamont and Tonelli if they had tits. 
[03:43:00]  And that little fucking pygmy is the bottle you put to your filthy hobo cum lips.  It was refreshing to hear somebody that was trying, that wanted to do this, that went out of his way, called up Jimmy, got some advice.  Good advice.  Great advice from Jimmy.  Might have saved a life today, Jimmy.  And then you talk to this mess, and this is someone who doesn't even want to try, and this is somebody that has a child.  And Christian is a guy who's struggling. 
[03:43:30]  He may or may not make it this time around, but at least he's making an effort.  Like, hold on, shut your cunt.  Shut your fat cunt while I'm trying to give some type of spiritual loving advice.  Just take your cunt and put a fucking bottle in it, or look for a train, so you can be fucking a complete set of parents.  Why don't you do that?  But the important thing is that he makes an effort, because if we don't have compassion for the people, we have nothing.  Let's say hi to Keith in New York. 
[03:44:00]  Keith?  Yes, I just want this whore to understand what she can do to a kid.  My mom was an alcoholic my whole entire life.  Yeah.  And luckily I turned out half decent.  And everything from being raised by one parent, being locked in a closet, just to being, you know, I'm not even close to where a part of the time, it was horrible, atrocious.  Growing up in the middle of Brooklyn, luckily I made it out of there, but my mom continued drinking. 
[03:44:30]  In fact, I had my wedding down in Florida, so she could be there.  And she pretty much passed out at the dinner table.  Oh.  And that's 20-some-odd years later.  I mean, it's just ridiculous how you can ruin someone's life.  There are plenty of programs, too, not just for alcoholics, but for people who are, like, you know, related to alcoholics or the adult children of alcoholics.  And there's plenty of places to go.  Hold on.  Excuse me, pig.  I'm talking to somebody about help they can get.  Somebody who's dealing with a parental issue.  Something you know nothing about. 
[03:45:00]  So why don't you go smooch an Amtrak while I'm talking to this young man?  Oh, I can't wait to see you in the next show.  What's that?  I can't wait to see you in the next show.  What do you want next show?  What are you going to do?  Show up and fucking...  I want you to come to my shows.  Because they'll say, wow, this guy attracts drinkers.  Let's hire him again.  No, no, no.  Let me take something.  What's the whole thing?  Keith, is that it there?  I'm telling you right now.  You know, just the whole thing I hope for her son is that he doesn't fall into the same thing.  Because when I went to college, I started drinking heavily. 
[03:45:30]  Luckily, I got out of it.  I hope her son does not fall into the same thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Good luck.  Bye, sweetie.  No, not for nothing, Jimmy.  I love you.  Let's say hi to Tom in California.  Do you love me?  You don't have to love me.  Just love your son.  Listen to me.  Okay.  Listen to me good.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I'm going to die.  All right.  Now...  Hold on.  Let me go ahead, die.  I'm an alcoholic.  I admit it.  Good for you.  Big deal.  It's information.  Anyone can say that.  You don't accept it.  You don't have to keep on cracking me, dude.  You know, like, bringing me down like that. 
[03:46:00]  What's wrong with you?  I'm talking nice to you.  All of a sudden, you're getting defensive.  What's the problem?  I can't...  I'm trying to help you.  Okay.  Shut up, cunt.  I'm not finished.  See?  You're not helping me.  I'm trying to help you.  People tried to help you so many fucking times.  And you let everyone down around you.  You denied everything.  The only time you've ever admitted that you're drunk is when people treat you like shit.  No, no, no.  It ain't even that, Anthony. 
[03:46:30]  It ain't even that.  It ain't even that.  I'm breaking your balls, and no matter what, you're getting fucking fed.  Yeah.  I just...  You just get a little fucking madness.  Rehabs already.  What?  Three rehabs.  Not one, not two, but three.  What?  What are you talking about?  I said three rehabs.  Yeah?  Okay.  Three rehabs.  Three rehabs.  I'm sure you have.  The only thing that will help you out is if you want to help yourself out.  That's it.  You get out of rehab.  You go out of the drink the next day.  What? 
[03:47:00]  I'm telling you right now.  The only thing that will help you out is if you want to help yourself.  Right, and you don't.  You don't, obviously.  And you don't want to help yourself.  So what's the point?  That's the point we're making.  How about your kid?  How about your son?  If you don't feel you're important enough.  You know, the son's now 15, so it doesn't even matter anymore.  We started this, what about your son crap, four or five years ago when it actually really mattered.  My son's fine.  But he died.  No, he's not.  The 1122 is on the way. 
[03:47:30]  Make sure you're in front of it.  Hey, buddy, Diane, what's your son's girlfriend's name?  What's his girlfriend's name?  Diane, what's your son's girlfriend's name?  My son's girlfriend's name?  What's her name?  How do you know that?  How do you know that?  How do you know that?  Because I talk to him every day.  You don't talk to him every day.  No, you don't.  You liar.  You're a liar.  Again, you're lying.  Give me your son's phone number.  I'm lying. 
[03:48:00]  Give me your son's phone number.  Yeah.  Okay.  We'd love to get him on the show.  Huh?  Wait, wait, hold on.  You want to phone for him?  Well, we'd be very nice to him.  We're not going to fuck with him.  He's 15, but we'd be very nice to him.  We want to ask him how much...  If I give you the phone number, you promise you won't put it all over the air?  No, no.  We're not going to...  We can't...  A, that's illegal to give out a phone number on the air.  And B, I mean, we're scumbags because we think you're an asshole.  We have no problem with your kid.  We feel bad for him.  No, no.  I'm just saying that because the phone number sometimes shows up on the air. 
[03:48:30]  I don't know.  No, you're not giving the number.  Give it to Derek off air.  We're not going to take it on the air, dude.  Hold on.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  All right, well, we got to...  What a wreck she is.  89-year-old granny fends off a tacker from CNN.  Oh, God love her.  Oh, oh, it really, it really shook me.  Marie Miller doesn't shake easily.  But Thursday afternoon, a man broke into her home in surprise.  She's quite a drink mixer. 
[03:49:00]  What's her name?  Something burdened.  She fends off an attacker.  Who tried to rob her?  Henry Fonda?  Just fucking knock her teeth out and take her shit.  Fucking crack her head up with her own walker.  Ah, I can't...  Ah, shut up.  Whack.  Did you really fend him off?  Yeah, did you?  Or did he just fucking not want to go to jail for murder and leave?  Cellophane skin.  Noon, a man broke into her home and surprised her when she returned from the beauty parlor. 
[03:49:30]  Excuse me, how old is she?  89.  Going to the beauty parlor?  I bet she doesn't even know it, but it's the local, it's the fucking mortician.  She probably lays on his table and he puts makeup on her, and then she gets up and scares him every week.  They're just practicing.  He doesn't even know she's not dead yet.  She goes, thank you, and he goes, ah, you get me every week.  Well, she's coming in, let's try the purple eye shadow.  See if that looks better for her funeral.  The beauty parlor.  When you start going to a beauty parlor, it has nothing to do with beauty. 
[03:50:00]  You're finished in life.  The parlor.  There's nothing beautiful about it.  I got my hair done.  It's like cotton candy.  He came in there and knocked me down on the bed and tried choking me.  I thought he was going to get me, you know, but I'm just going to give it everything I got.  Miller's instincts kicked in.  She fought back.  I would try to pull his hands off from my neck, you know, and like that, and was trying to kick him and scratch him. 
[03:50:30]  I think she's amazing.  Miller's daughter, Cheryl Shiflett, says just hours after the attack, her mother was, well, back to being a mom.  First thing she said last night on the couch and her mouth is still bleeding like crazy, she said, I need to buy us all dinner.  You're not going to want to cook.  Oh, that's adorable.  As her mouth's bleeding, why don't you get her a rag, first of all?  Jesus.  What weak-handed motherfucker was trying to choke an 89-year-old and couldn't pull it off? 
[03:51:00]  Couldn't get the job done.  How'd she defend him?  She probably, I shit my diapers, and then he just ran away.  How'd a fucking creep try to choke an old lady?  That is sick.  Jesus.  And then fails.  You're a creep and a failure.  I mean, I don't advocate the killing of the elderly.  I'm just saying if you're going to try it, do it.  You might as well get it right.  Yeah.  What an awkward place for my screen to freeze off.  Is that why it stopped there?  Because I was like, that's a cool picture of us.  Oh, wait.  Oh, it just went away. 
[03:51:30]  I closed it down.  It's the most perfect picture of juicy lips or juicy man lips around a perfect penis and  a fucking computer stopped.  And I'm like, all right, I get it, queer.  Move.  Jesus Christ.  Jimmy's looking, and I'm getting all uncomfortable that Jimmy's looking, and the picture of a  guy stuck in another man's cock has been on my screen for five minutes.  I'm like, is he going to aim the pal talk camera at it?  We get it, Travis and Derek.  Why?  I knew it was fucking Derek, because I saw those stupid mandels he wears.  Fucking open-toed shoes.  Your feet have AIDS.  Yeah, now you have sneakers on, Peter Pumper. 
[03:52:00]  Can I fucking call you out on it?  Fucking, your awful fucking Lamont and Tonelli feet.  You should have a fucking small black foot in between your two feet.  A teeny laughing black foot.  Her hairdo may have saved her.  Her hairdo.  Jesus.  Her hairdo.  How?  A few years ago, the mother-daughter team took a self-defense class.  In an instant, everything Miller learned came back to her.  They tell you to scream, try to pop them in the nose, but I couldn't get my hand up there. 
[03:52:30]  And remember that trip to the beauty parlor?  She thinks that may have helped, too.  I said it was so, so fuzzy here, all these curls.  That's what helped my head when he was banging my head in the bed.  The suspect got away with Miller's car and cell phone.  Perhaps even a few scratches.  Miller, though, feels she won the fight. 
[03:53:00]  What kind of fucking animal attacks a lady that old and physically assaults her?  How do you not, as a fucking society, how do we not capture him and then just break both of his legs and shins with a bat?  How do you not just maim that piece of shit?  They'll claim, you know, drugs.  It was all because of drugs.  I got no problem with a guy on drugs robbing somebody to get money.  If you break into someone's, I mean, it's wrong, but I know why you're doing it.  But they claim it all the time, like in a case like this. 
[03:53:30]  There's no other defense.  He was pissed off at old people.  It's always, well, you know, drugs, hard youth growing up.  Lady Di was his mother when he was fucking 15.  Shit like that.  Are we going to get Lady Di's son on the phone or what?  Yeah, try right now.  Lady Di's son on the phone.  She's probably calling him.  And these guys are going to ask you all kinds of questions.  Questions.  Yeah.  Now, don't tell them anything about me.  I feel bad.  He's 15.  He would probably love this show under different circumstances. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  That we don't have his mother on calling her a whore.  Lady Di, what's going on with your son's phone number there?  Nothing.  I'm still a whore.  I'm still a whore.  What?  What?  Sounded like I'm supposed to go, but I want to go suck some cock.  I swear to God, it sounded like that.  It sounded like that.  That was just your inner monologue, Ed.  Yeah, idiot.  Did they get your son's phone number?  What?  Are we calling him?  I can't hear.  Oh, it's busy?  Yeah.  It's busy.  What was he talking to? 
[03:54:30]  I'm like, die.  Good Day, New York, American Idol skit with Mike Wood.  Oh, I got to hear him acting.  Oh, Mike Wood.  He's probably a good actor.  He couldn't be any worse than the people we have in this fucking studio.  You're in my fucking weather, man.  Bye.  Bye.  In this clip, you hear the Good Day cast play American Idol judges, including Mike Woods as Randy Jackson.  Of course.  Well, Tony, cheers.  Thanks so much.  Simon Cowell here.  And welcome to Good Day American Idol auditions. 
[03:55:00]  Thank you very much.  All our duo.  How's the dog pound?  All our duo.  Randy Jackson.  You look good, dog.  Lost some weight there, dog.  Well, you know, you got to do what you got to do.  That's a dog pound demand.  I'm going to bring him.  All right, who's next here?  Oh, my God.  He had nothing.  He had nothing.  He was supposed to improv a little as Randy, and he had nothing.  After dog, he went, you got to do what you got to do.  Cool. 
[03:55:30]  That's great.  Fucking Stallone movie quote.  Oh, is he horrible.  Oh, man.  Let's see.  What you got to do is the contestant number four, and she is Dr. Sapna Parikh.  Oh, yeah.  I cannot believe I'm doing this.  Oh, yeah.  Was that one of his quotes?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  He's fucking, he has the Kool-Aid guys dialogue.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die? 
[03:56:00]  Doing this.  The things I do on the show.  So, Don, why do you think you're the next American Idol?  Wait, say that again.  Why do you think you're the next American Idol?  I think I'm the next, well, you find out.  You ain't see.  I was thinking before I was in love with people, but it's been a long time.  Give it to us, baby.  Come on, I want to see it.  Where do they find these people?  Can'timprov.com?  Do any of these fuckheads have a thought?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Why do you think you're going to be the next American Idol during an American Idol sketch? 
[03:56:30]  Well, how are you just to see?  Good.  Happened there, too, then.  Hey, Randy.  Uh-huh.  Dog, do what you got to do.  What fucking cliche is bringing nobody's?  Yeah, come on.  Bring it on.  Every single day I walk down the street.  I hear people say, baby, so sweet.  Ever since puberty, everybody stares at me.  Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby.  So be mine, but don't lose your mind. 
[03:57:00]  Just remember that I'm your baby.  It all started with my stepfather looking into my baby.  You're going to Hollywood, baby.  You know, I have to say that I think she has a tremendous amount of soul.  She's got some great pipes.  And did you see her body?  Hello.  Her body was on point.  Yeah, so I give it a thumbs up. 
[03:57:30]  I say Hollywood, baby.  On point.  From one body to another.  Randy, well, I got to say, doc, you brought it.  So you're going to Hollywood, baby?  She's actually acting, man.  You got to.  You're going.  Doctor, thank you very much.  But he didn't.  He just said, you brought it.  He just repeated the line he heard once.  Is this news, by the way?  This is a news show.  I'm right.  Did I go insane at some point? 
[03:58:00]  Or is this the fucking news?  Do we want to hear the rest of this?  It's awful.  It's fucking.  We do.  We have to.  Not only do we want to hear this, I want to watch the DVD when I get home.  Next, we have a young lady who I think does the traffic as well as Sing.  She was talking a lot of snack a little earlier, though.  So she's got a little.  Hi.  Hi, Stacey Ann.  Is it Gooden?  Is that what it says here on the card?  Yes, it's Stacey Ann Gooden.  All right.  What have you got for us today, Stacey Ann?  I do have to say his last name, so.  Oh, no. 
[03:58:30]  I'm going to sing.  I think I'm the next American Idol because I could sing.  All right.  Really?  And that's what everybody tells me.  Let's see.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I'm going to sing Mary J. Blige, Real Love.  Mm-hmm.  We are lovers through and through, and though we made it through the storm, I really want  you to realize, I really want to put you on.  I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need.  Won't you be my inspiration? 
[03:59:00]  We're the real love that I need.  Real love.  I'm searching for real love.  Someone to set my heart free real love.  Goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  Jeff Goldblum doesn't care for her singing.  He should be a judge.  But he must have seen her bank account somewhere.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Oh, my God. 
[03:59:30]  Here's Stacey being judged.  Well, thank you very much.  Randy Jackson, I saw you were grooving out there.  I was trying to feel it.  But you know, I don't know if that was the right song choice for you, baby.  You know?  What are you talking about?  Wrong song choice?  Please.  I don't know, you know.  I was just, I don't know if I felt that.  I don't think so.  You want to feel it, Paula?  Is that a thumbs up or thumbs down from you?  Mr. Jackson.  I don't know.  Come on.  Come on.  Let me talk to my partners over here.  Come on, Paula.  What do you think?  Be real now.  I think that she talked a whole lot of smack about some other folks. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, no, you did not.  I can sing.  I know I can sing.  Because your mama told you?  Because everybody told me I had to sing.  You can sing, but can you sing well?  No.  I can sing another song.  Keep your day job.  We've heard enough.  All the time, I've been building for Christmas.  We'll be right back. 
[04:00:30]  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  It's incomprehensibly bad.  Like, it's not entertaining.  It's not funny.  No.  It's not ironic.  On every level, it's horrid.  It was putrid dog shit.  On every level, that was fucking unentertaining.  Oh, my God.  And the phony laughs.  What are people doing in show business?  What the fuck are people doing? 
[04:01:00]  JC and Jackson.  Hey, what's going on, man?  I love you guys' show, man.  Our question is for Jim.  Hey, do you have any live stand-up out on DVD at the Blockbuster Hollywood video or anything  or on sale anywhere?  The only live DVD I have was my HBO special, my one-night stand, which I think you can get  at Tower Records.  And I know you can get it at Amazon.com.  I don't know what stores carry it.  People say a lot of stores don't have it.  So I don't know who HBO released it to.  But that's the only stand-up I have on DVD.  All right, man. 
[04:01:30]  You guys, keep it up.  Hey, I got a question for Lady Di, man.  You know, kids grow up to be famous like him and them.  I'm going to just leave it like that and bash their moms, you know, for their drug use  and everything.  But, man, you guys, man, I love your show, man.  Y'all keep up the good work, man.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Thanks, JC.  All right, later.  All right.  I think the Lamont and Tonelli MySpace, I think they're trying to clean it up because it's  impossible to get on.  And then when you get on, it seems like all the bad things have been taken off. 
[04:02:00]  But then minutes later, they're back on again.  They know the attack is happening.  Yeah, yeah.  And, of course, being the cowards, they don't leave it up.  They take it off.  Yeah.  What the fuck, guys?  They called out the pest, and now they're just being cowards like they are.  Yeah, they're really having a hard time keeping up with that one.  And they will.  Every time they clean it up, pests will join and fucking attack them.  Even if they can't get the posts on.  They said bring it on.  And then they can't.  Then they hide.  Well, it has been brought in. 
[04:02:30]  Can we go?  We got a meeting to do.  Meeting.  We got a meeting.  We got to go back.  Almost vacation time, though.  We have to go back to the other place now.  Now we go back over there.  We were just there.  Why can't they come here for the meeting?  Because it has nothing to do with this establishment.  What's going on with the officers here?  Looking good, man.  Have you heard anything?  A couple of couches, some things to put your feet on. 
[04:03:00]  It's starting to look like something out there.  Got to get rid of some of those.  Two years later.  Not bad, guys.  Not bad.  Two years later.  Holy shit.  We'll get it done.  You know, that puts it in perspective.  You don't think it's like, well, it kind of looks good.  Two fucking years.  Holy shit.  I've been saving that comment for a while because they like to say how we bitch and bitch and  bitch.  And then you just hit them with the time thing.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Well, it's been two years.  Where's Elo been?  I haven't talked to him.  Now we got a nice couch out there.  Actually, that's not even a nice couch.  No.  That's the couch that Broad brought. 
[04:03:30]  Yep.  The poker trick.  Right.  That was about two years ago.  That was early on in our tenure.  Hey, where's Frank's place, Guy, been?  Someone said he's been giving a hard time to somebody about something.  Frank's place.  Wouldn't you give us a hard time if your cubicle was that over there in the corner?  That studio could be the smallest studio I've ever seen anywhere.  Which is fine.  I don't mind having the guy around.  So they pushed his cubicle.  Oh, he's had his cubicle in the corner?  Wait, wait.  No way.  Let me see.  Look.  At least he has a window.  Oh, shit.  I got to look at this. 
[04:04:00]  Hold on.  He refused to leave.  It's our joint now.  And so they made a tiny little cubicle in the corner.  Excuse me.  That's my stapler.  It could be the smallest cubicle ever.  Yeah, we're going to need you to go down into the basement.  Yeah.  As far as I'm concerned, he has too much room.  I fucking, I want to hang my jacket somewhere and that's just the proper amount of space. 
[04:04:30]  They're going to build a wall there too?  Someone said.  That's fine.  That's what he wants.  Came in a little corner.  He's doing Frank's place.  Holy shit.  God, those are lovely.  Yeah, look at everybody's computer monitor.  It's got the same picture.  Baby girl's bosoms.  And then just her little pink shorts with the little bow tie in the front.  It's a little white tie that you just want to untie and have them tumble to the ground.  Tumble.  And she'll go, oh look, it's my vag.  Tee hee.  That's what she'd say as they fell down.  Oh Jim, quit kissing me there. 
[04:05:00]  I just tinkled.  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  How you doing, Jim?  Oh shit.  Wow, can you kill a vibe?  I'm talking about kissing the vag of somebody whose vag I want to kiss and you chime in and  fucking throw anthrax on my dick.  I have to chime in.  I'm not picking on you, Jim.  So you had a few more shots, feeling a little better?  No, no, no.  I had a few more beers.  No, no, no. 
[04:05:30]  No, no, no.  Feeling no more pain, huh?  Vitamin and Vegemine has vitamins, meat, vegetables, and minerals.  I'm hoping to pick on Jim.  Do you pop out at parties?  Are you unpopular?  Are you unpopular?  Vitamin and Vegemine.  You're drunk.  Wait, she called to give me some business.  Did you call to pick on me?  I called to pick on you especially, Jim.  Go ahead, pick on me.  It's your floor.  Go.  Come on, Jim.  Let's go.  Go ahead. 
[04:06:00]  Jimmy?  Yes.  Go ahead.  You called to pick on me.  So I'm saying pick on me.  You're the comedian.  You pick on me first.  Okay, you're a drunk cunt.  Your turn.  Well, you're a stupid-ass cock.  Ooh, way.  Okay.  All right.  Um, I hope you fall down the steps and your uterus gets caught in the hand railing.  Point to Jim.  Well, I hope you fall down the steps and land on your head first. 
[04:06:30]  Oh, that sucks.  Okay.  I don't know how to pick on you.  This is a little new to me.  This is a little new to me.  Um, I hope you get cancer of the scalp.  I hope you get cancer of the prostate.  See, here's the thing.  You can't keep using my painful things.  Right.  I say steps.  You say steps.  How about you go first? 
[04:07:00]  Your turn.  You go ahead.  I go first?  Yes.  I go first.  Yeah.  Let's see.  I can't pick on you.  You're so healthy.  Go ahead.  I'm healthy?  I haven't worn a condom in 18 years.  Go ahead.  You haven't worn a condom in 18 years?  Don't repeat that.  You go on.  You call to tease me.  Go ahead.  Go.  I'm going to listen.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I don't know.  Somebody's trying to saw us over here right now because I have no idea.  Please put your skull next to it. 
[04:07:30]  Gosh.  Let me see.  Come on, Mike Wood.  I'm going to pick on you first.  I'm going to pick on you first.  I hope you gain a lot of weight.  So this way you could just die of...  Oh, my God.  I'm dying over here.  I'm dying over here.  Thank you.  Okay, my turn.  Jimmy, your turn.  Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?  Duh.  Duh.  I don't know what to tell you about that. 
[04:08:00]  Why don't you take a short...  I don't know what to tell you.  You called to insult me.  Yes, I did.  So I'm allowing you to.  So go ahead.  Go.  You little bald baby kid, you.  Jimmy?  To you?  Are you laughing so you don't cry? 
[04:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Opie, don't chime in on this one.  Oh, she told you.  How about this?  Holy shit, Opie.  She just told you.  Wow.  Don't you chime in.  I don't know what I'm going to do with that.  I'm going to chime in on this one because it's between me and Jim.  Lady Di, the next time I see you, I'm going to kick you in the cunt.  That was Opie.  That was Opie.  I'm going to kick you in your cock.  No.  See, here's the difference.  I'm actually going to kick you in the cunt when I see you. 
[04:09:00]  That's the difference.  Because you just played into something that really bothers me.  So now I have to kick you in the cunt.  Okay.  You do that, honey.  I promise.  I will kick you in your ass.  I promise that I will kick you in the cunt when I see you next.  Anthony.  Anything else?  You said you were going to kick me in the cunt.  I didn't say shit, you dummy.  I will kick you in your ass. 
[04:09:30]  I think, here's my insult, you're full of bunk.  Jimmy, I will kick you in your ass, too.  Language, young man.  This is still my home.  You're full of malarkey.  Okay.  I'm full of malarkey right now.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  That's her father.  Get the fuck out, now.  That's what I heard this guy say when she was in his frigid airbox. 
[04:10:00]  Here's your son's teacher at school in the very near future.  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  She can't hear us?  Yeah.  She'll answer that.  She can't hear us right now.  She'll answer to this.  Go ahead.  Get the fuck out, now.  Get the fuck out, where?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Hey, Jimmy.  How'd your parents die? 
[04:10:30]  My parents?  Why not?  Oh, here we go with the recordings again.  Oh, you're too smart for us.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You know what?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm really smart compared to you guys.  I'm really smart about that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're dumb compared to a cicada.  Shut up already.  How does it feel to have a body like a tall beetle? 
[04:11:00]  You have a body like a dung beetle.  Listen to me.  You should be crawling over a stegosaurus log.  You're a dung beetle with a mullet.  I want to go on stage to belittle you right now.  You want to go on stage?  The only time you should be on stage is if a donkey is fucking you.  I want to be the opening act for you.  And they have to give the donkey Viagra.  The opening act.  You are really drunk.  I want to be the opening act for you.  You're really drunk.  You're susped.  I'm not really drunk. 
[04:11:30]  You are hammered.  Please drive.  Oh, yeah.  I am not hammered.  You can open for Jim as long as it's at a train station.  I'm not at a train station.  Oh, God.  Why?  I don't go to a train station anymore.  Why?  Yeah.  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the word of God.  Hey, dung beetle body.  What are you trying to talk about?  I want to be your opening act, Jimmy Norton.  Shut up.  You have a body like a dung beetle. 
[04:12:00]  It doesn't make any difference.  I want to be your opening act.  Shut up, flat ass.  I guarantee you one thing right now.  The retarded Laverne, Shirley.  No one cares about them.  They're dead to us.  We don't care about the return.  Quiet.  What do you mean you don't care about the retarded Laverne, Shirley?  The return of Shirley.  What's the alarm?  You were all slurring.  What's the alarm?  You blew it, Lady Di.  You blew it.  The retarded Laverne, Shirley had some legs and you blew it for everybody.  But you know what? 
[04:12:30]  We didn't need you.  So we got new people.  That's right.  You're done.  No, wait, wait.  And I will kick you in the cunt when I see you.  You're done.  You do that.  And I will kick you in your fucking balls.  You.  Lady Di, you have no idea what you're dealing with.  Trust me on this one.  I will be doing this now.  What happened to Lady Di?  No, she's dead.  Oh, more.  Lady Di's the crown.  Lady Di's the crown.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Yes, we are. 
[04:13:00]  Yes, we are.  Is Lady Di going to be having sex?  She was very badly raped, you see?  Oh.  None of your business.  We got to start calling you Alky Di.  Good evening.  Whatever.  There's nothing lady about you.  That's what every bottle of booze says to her when she walks to the liquor store.  Good evening.  Shears in her head.  Doesn't make any difference.  Yeah.  Doesn't make any difference.  Okay?  What?  Now, I want to go to the show August 26th at the PNC Bank Art Center. 
[04:13:30]  How does that sound?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  oh  yeah 
[04:14:00]  hello  hello  hello  hello  food  alright  hello  hello 
[04:14:30]  hello  is anyone  we'll end with this song  thanks for listening to us today guys  oh there are several  ways to irritate a lady  you could mention that a rat's  gone out of style  oh that's sure to get a nip  it's bound to cause a tip  but here's a little trick to go the  extra mile 
[04:15:00]  give her  just a little kick in  the cunt  a kick in the cunt  a kick in the cunt  that's about a nice kick in the cunt  you'll sure have  if you go for the punt  with a jolly good kick in the cunt  now a lady of great  will show utter distaste  for a slur or a randy suggestion 
[04:15:30]  but if you call her a whore  it may do nothing more  than make a subtle change in her complexion  so give her a kick in the cunt  a kick in the cunt  a kick in the cunt  has about a lovely kick in the cunt  eh  if you ain't to annoy  there's no better fly  than a rousing good kick in the cunt  now you might want a sucker  or clopping the choppers  a shocker for making a grabber 
[04:16:00]  and knockers  but she'll call the coppers  and you'll end in jail  where you eat bread and water  and shit in a pail  so if you've enough of a womanly guff  no need to be rough  it'll be quite enough  to call her block  with a huff and a puff  to snuff your foot straight into the muff  just a no-fashioned kick in the cunt  a kick in the cunt  a kick in the cunt  has about an eyes kick in the cunt  you'll sure have a stump  when you go for the punt 
[04:16:30]  with a jolly good kick in the cunt  hey what's that?  well you've never seen it before?  it looks like a rock  new from sedentary toys  and the Opie and Anthony show  oh it's so shiny  it's got corners  it's the cool new toy  that has everyone jumping for joy  O&A Party Rock  it's not just any rock  it's the O&A Party Rock  the O&A Party Rock  is incredibly versatile  you can chuck it  you can buck it  you can drop it in a bucket  you can race it  you can chase it  you can yell right in its face  it's the bestest friend 
[04:17:00]  you'll ever have  O&A Party Rock  why is it wearing a party hat?  every party rock  comes dressed in a colorful party hat  and party blower  making it the centerpiece  of any party  now with shiny red dancing shoes  not only that  the O&A Party Rock  is  is  is  it's a fucking rock  you dildo  so  is
