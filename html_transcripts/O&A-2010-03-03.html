<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a segment centered on Roger Ebert's appearance following his cancer treatments.  Opie and Anthony graphically described Ebert's facial disfigurement, resulting from the surgical removal of his lower jaw, tongue, and voice box. They detailed the resulting open, gaping appearance of his mouth and the difficulty he had moving his lips, using crude humor and explicit language to describe his condition.  The hosts referenced recent photographs of Ebert and played audio clips from an Oprah Winfrey interview featuring Ebert and his wife.  They commented on Ebert's communication challenges post-surgery, drawing comparisons to Stephen Hawking's situation.  The segment consisted primarily of the hosts' reactions to and commentary on Ebertâ€™s appearance and the Oprah interview, with no outside guests appearing in studio besides Opie and Anthony themselves.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I have a raging heart on you.  Let me tell you something about this radio show you listen to.  We are really good.  Yeah, man, we hang out, we're going to be all wet.  Yeah, man, we know when we suck, we know when we're great, but we do like when you say how 
[00:00:30]  great we are.  Holy shit, oh my good golly, we're broadcasting again.  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, Roger Ebert.  I don't even want to wait, I want to get right into this Roger Ebert thing.  Silly Roger Ebert.  Roger Ebert. 
[00:01:00]  From the Cursed Show.  What was it called?  What was that little show called?  At the Movies.  At the Movies.  Yeah.  With Roger and...  At the Ebert.  At the Ebert.  At the Ebert.  At the Ebert.  At the Ebert.  At the Ebert.  Here they come.  Fucking, here come the jokes.  Oh, both of them.  Oh, man.  Both of them.  What did he have?  He had the brain cancer and Roger had...  I say had because we're looking at a dead guy, basically.  Even though he's cancer free, but he had thyroid cancer. 
[00:01:30]  Terrible.  And we heard the rumors over the years and he had to step away because he lost his voice.  Well, the thyroid cancer ended up taking his lower jaw, which includes, obviously, his  teeth, his tongue, his voice box, and other stuff that he's probably not really revealing.  He wears a big, huge turtleneck to cover up a world of hurt.  And they reconstructed a...  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  I guess like a...  I guess they kept the skin.  They just kind of...  Yeah.  They just ice cream scooped everything out of his lower jaw.  So the skin's kind of there.  Oh, look at him.  The skin is there and the lower lip is there.  And pictures of Roger Ebert started surfacing a little while ago.  So, but, man, he has come back out of hiding and he was on Oprah yesterday and...  I don't know, man.  He doesn't even...  It was fascinating.  He doesn't even look like the guy. 
[00:02:30]  To say the least.  No, he doesn't look like Roger at all.  And he was on Oprah, so they showed him...  They showed how he's living now with his wife of 18 years.  And they went into how he communicates.  And then they got his Oscar picks, by the way, which was kind of strange.  Oh, great.  But his home...  The weird thing about Roger Ebert...  I don't even know where to go with this.  There's so much.  His mouth just hangs completely...  Hangs open.  Completely wide open. 
[00:03:00]  Because he doesn't have any muscles or anything.  And he's got the upper teeth.  It looks like he's constantly got a big shit-eating grin on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, ah!  Let's hear him.  No, I don't.  Because I didn't realize at the time they were...  All right.  That's good.  That's...  Oh, my God.  That's how he's got to talk now?  The Stephen Hawking...  He's a MacBook Pro.  And he's just...  He's just smiling the whole time because that's what it looks like.  Like, it's...  You know, uh...  Oh, God.  There is no God.  Sam pulled the audio, but... 
[00:03:30]  I think this segment's only 10 minutes.  We should run through the whole damn thing.  This Oprah show yesterday was just...  Holy shit.  You want to run through the whole thing instead of just a few clips?  Well, let's, you know, we'll run through it and stop when need be, I gather.  All right.  Oh.  Because they explained the whole story of Raj Ebert.  I mean, everybody was talking about this Raj Ebert thing yesterday.  He looks better now than he did last time I saw him, though.  I'll say that.  Like, he looks bad, but his surgery, he looks a lot better now than he did, say, a year 
[00:04:00]  or two ago.  Like, I saw his picture.  Can they put something in there?  Like, what?  A jawbone of an ass or something?  He has his giant teeth.  I'm using it.  He kind of can move his lips together, but it looks like it takes a lot of effort, because  then the whole lower, what used to be his jaw, just kind of, you know, falls back down.  What's in his mouth?  Like, I was just looking.  There's something white in there.  Well, Sam says that he thinks there's a hole. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  So you can see right through. </pre>
