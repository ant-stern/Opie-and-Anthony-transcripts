<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about daylight savings time and a mocking critique of the John and Jeff radio show, specifically their segment on countries without tipping.  The conversation then veered into speculation about a frequent traveler to Thailand, with humorous (and crude) suggestions of drug smuggling or pedophilia as motivations. This led to a discussion about the relationship between chaotic city traffic and the accessibility of sex, using Thailand as an example, and even included a mention of a board operator allegedly on the no-fly list due to frequent Thailand trips. A caller, Maureen, created a comedic moment by confusingly attempting to explain daylight savings time, resulting in the hosts equally confused attempts to understand the concept.

The show then transitioned to a review of top Yahoo searches, focusing on several female celebrities, including teachers involved in sexual relationships with students (Debra Lefebvre), Anna Nicole Smith, Britney Spears, and American Idol contestant Antonella Barber, whose popularity was linked to explicit photos. Audio clips of Antonella's singing were played, contrasting her vocal ability with her attractiveness.  This led to a discussion about American Idol contestant Frenchie Davis's dismissal, raising questions about racial and size biases, fueled by Rosie O'Donnell's comments.

The "story of the month" segment featured a principal arrested for meth possession, watching gay porn, and indecent acts in his office. This segued into a discussion about a naked man repeatedly walking around his property, later revealed to have a history of child sexual abuse and child pornography possession.  The hosts debated the legality of public nudity and considered a comedic stunt involving naked women retrieving mail, before returning to the topic of child sexual abuse, the death penalty, and prison life.  Sexually explicit and offensive humor targeting various people's physical attributes was a recurring theme throughout this segment.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls detailing experiences in prison. Callers, many identifying as CEOs, described the surprisingly comfortable aspects of prison life, contrasting it with the harsh realities faced by those convicted of crimes against children. The prevalence of rape in prison was frequently discussed, with callers offering varied perspectives and anecdotes.  The discussions included details about gang dynamics (Aryan Brotherhood), racial segregation, inmate and guard behavior, and even instances of inmates deliberately causing trouble for homosexual encounters in isolation.  One caller described a prisoner tattooed with his victim's name.  A studio guest, Rich Voss, contributed nonsensical and absurd comments throughout this segment, along with discussion of a St. Patrick's Day karaoke event and a brief mention of a South Park episode about the N-word.

Another segment featured Lisa, a caller detailing her experiences in Arizona Tent City jail after multiple DUIs, describing deplorable conditions.  The hosts and Lisa discussed drunk driving and the types of crimes female inmates typically commit.  Rich Voss called in again, expressing his displeasure with showing ultrasound pictures to friends, sparking a discussion about sharing such images.  Jocelyn, another female caller, shared her county jail experience for drug possession, including details about inmate relationships and interactions with a corrections officer. Further calls involved Rich Vossâ€™s comedy gigs, an anecdote about an empty NYPD car used to slow traffic, and promotion of MacBook Karaoke, again featuring a contestant whose explicit photos were discussed.  The show ended with a further discussion and analysis of the South Park episode focusing on the N-word, including played clips.


A significant segment heavily featured a South Park clip repeatedly using the racial slur "nigger guy," prompting debate about the word's usage, censorship, and differing treatment by white versus Black comedians.  The hosts satirized a proposed bill to ban the phrase, highlighting the absurdity of censorship. A caller, Dave, threatened to cancel his subscription in response. The discussion broadened to free speech, citing examples of student punishments for using words like "vagina" and suppression of speakers on college campuses. Anecdotes included a comedian (Rich) having a drink thrown at him and high school students suspended for using "vagina." A children's book banned for containing "scrotum" was also mentioned.  The latter half of the segment involved a heated phone call with Andrew Dice Clay, revealing past collaborations and a conflict due to Dice's alleged mistreatment of Opie and perceived betrayal, leading to Dice abruptly ending the call.  The segment ended with further discussion of Dice and his behavior.

A later segment focused on the fallout with Dice, including a discussion of a phone call where he abruptly hung up on Opie.  Callers expressed support for Opie and Anthony.  Dice's contrasting behavior on Howard Stern's show was noted, along with jokes about Dice's perceived cowardice and his upcoming book. The show also included promotion of a "walkover" event, numerous listener calls, a "Porn Libs" segment with highly explicit language, a guest appearance by Jimmy Norton participating in Porn Libs, a song by Steve from Bayshore (an Elvis impersonator) about Jimmy Norton and AIDS with explicit lyrics, and mentions of Howard Stern, Patrice O'Neal, and Bob Saget (with an expletive).  The overall tone was highly informal, filled with profanity, and centered on the conflict with Dice and listener reactions.  The show concluded with several celebrity voicemails.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Shut up, shut up, shut up!  No!  Shut up!  Ow!  Opie.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at this face, how do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagel. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi.  Anthony and I, we're looking out the window.  Good morning.  Here in New York City.  Good morning.  And we see through the building, because we have this fine, fine window, that's slightly, 
[00:01:00]  ever so slightly getting light out.  Yeah.  At 6 a.m.  Eastern Time.  Uh-huh.  Notice when we used to come in, it was pitch black, and it would be for quite some time  into our show.  It's been pitch black, uh, pitch black this time in the morning for many, many months,  and I don't even know, uh, the last time where it was light out as we were starting our radio  show.  And we're getting a little excited, like, oh, spring's in the air. 
[00:01:30]  And then I told Ant that, uh, this goes away, what, Sunday?  Yeah.  Daylight savings time, and they knock us back into pitch dark for another 30 days or so.  Welcome back to the darkness.  So enjoy that very slight glimpse of, uh, daylight as we start the show, because that  goes away.  Bluish, grayish color out, and spring is the last thing that's in the air.  Ah, we got another day or two, and then it's going to turn around drastically for us here  in New York.  Well, good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:00]  Our phone number, 1-866-313-313.  People are waiting for us already.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, uh, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Mike.  I'm just trying to figure out how John and Jeff got Opie for the guest appearance this  morning.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  It was funny.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Oh, no.  I mean, John and Jeff, they're on before us here in New York, and a few other cities 
[00:02:30]  that we're broadcasting to, I think they pick up the John and Jeff show because it's  very cheap.  Ah, throw this show on.  No one's listening anyway.  Anyway, who cares?  They don't even know they're on.  No one told them.  No.  Pull their show out of the air and throw it on your station.  And I came in.  I went right to the bathroom, and they're doing a break about what country doesn't allow  tipping.  I'm like, who cares?  What?  And then they're trying to figure it out.  Like, is it Pakistan?  No.  Is it France? 
[00:03:00]  No.  Is it Indonesia?  No.  No.  Israel.  Israel is the answer.  There you go.  I don't even know what the answer is.  But see, they're not even smart enough to make that joke.  They're not even smart enough.  They're not mean enough.  They're not smart enough to make the obvious joke.  If you're going to talk about a country that doesn't allow tipping, my God.  Have some fun with it.  Israel and the continent of Africa. 
[00:03:30]  Israel and the continent of Africa. 
[00:04:00]  One time.  I was going to say more than once, but no.  One time.  You're not looking at the sites.  If you're kidnapped and taken to Thailand, you should still be suspect of something.  That's how bad it is to just go to Thailand.  It's Disneyland for pedophiles.  Yeah.  It really is.  You're either.  It's one of two things, really.  You're there to be a drug mule, to take drugs back, or a pedophile.  And, like, 90% is pedophile, and 10% is drugs. 
[00:04:30]  Why is he going there so many times?  The guy goes there like people go to Orlando.  Yeah.  It's just a ridiculous amount of times.  And he was talking today about the traffic in Bangkok.  And trust me, we don't listen to the John Jeff show.  We have to because it's on all the monitors as we're getting ready for our dumb radio show.  Oh, let's just admit it.  We listen all the time.  We're forced to listen to this.  So he's talking about traffic in Bangkok and how traffic in Bangkok is crazy. 
[00:05:00]  There's scooters everywhere, and they're all going, like, their own direction for the most part.  And there's three people on each scooter.  And then they got the bike, the bicyclist with the thing in the back.  Just picture the right after the drill sergeant scene in Full Metal Jacket.  Yeah, there you go.  When they first get to Vietnam, and they're sitting at the table.  Right.  And their camera gets ripped off.  That's what I picture it looking like.  Just scooters, bicycles, hookers. 
[00:05:30]  So I got a very obvious theory.  If your traffic is that chaotic in your city, sex is very easy to have.  You could get sex.  I was going to use the term everyone uses.  But you could get sex a lot easier.  If your traffic patterns are crazy and you could die at any second, the you-know-what is really good in that city and very easy to get.  And why is that?  I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  It just happens.  New York.  If a city is set up where traffic is just willy-nilly, that's where the sex is.  Yeah, and it's younger, too.  The sex you could get is younger.  Interesting.  I'm not saying illegal.  You figure that out at home.  I'm just saying it's younger and younger depending on the traffic pattern and how crazy it is on the city streets as you're driving around.  New York City, very organized.  Yeah.  A grid, lots of lights, lots of cops out there making sure everyone's driving correctly. 
[00:06:30]  Not as easy to get the hoo-bah.  But in Thailand, when you're like barely holding on to the back of a scooter.  Six people.  It looks like a circus act.  You can pretty much perform a sex act at a light if they even have them.  I don't even think they have traffic lights.  Yeah.  Like circles.  A lot of traffic circles in those places.  But he goes there a lot.  Yeah.  Apparently, what was Iraq saying?  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  How do you know this info?  Yeah.  Where did this info come from? 
[00:07:00]  The guy who runs the board for their show.  Oh, boy.  He just blew up his spot.  Did he say it on the air?  A while ago.  Oh, okay.  So this is something that was said on the show.  Apparently, yes.  Well, secondhand.  So we'll just say allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  His comments were that he was on the no-fly list at some point.  Yeah.  I think he was discussing the fact that he's no longer on the no-fly list.  Oh, okay.  Well, why was he?  That is what we're trying to find out. 
[00:07:30]  I think they just throw you on the no-fly list if you go to Thailand more than 100 times.  I told a story about a businessman that would go to Thailand all the time.  And he was flagged at customs just for that.  Just for the fact that, look, you've been to Thailand too many times.  And they asked him his business and stuff, and it didn't quite jibe with going to Thailand.  So they went through his laptop computer, and poof, poof, they found some stuff.  Oh, no.  They found some things. 
[00:08:00]  Away you go.  See you later.  Business with children's toys?  Yeah.  You all right?  Maureen on Long Island.  I think we got the whole daylight savings thing.  Savings time wrong.  You got me wrong.  Didn't you remember when you were a kid it was always spring ahead, fall behind?  Yeah, so if you spring ahead, then 6 o'clock will become 7 o'clock.  Yes.  So that means 6 o'clock is now.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Right now would be, starting Monday right now, would be 7.08 in the morning. 
[00:08:30]  So we would have had to start an hour ago.  Right.  And it's going to be an hour ago darkness, you dolt.  I did have it figured out.  You're a dolt.  No, you're wrong.  You're wrong, you idiot.  Jesus Christ, could you look at our point here?  Hold on.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  No, it's funny because every time we have to change the clocks, I can't figure out if  we're getting more light in the morning.  I can figure it out in the afternoon.  That's easy.  Hold on.  Let me think about this.  Let's say it's 6 o'clock. 
[00:09:00]  Right now.  Right now.  All right, and look outside.  It's even lighter.  It's light.  It's getting nice and light.  Now, you put the clock ahead.  To 7.  To 7.  So now we're looking at 7 o'clock outside.  Now we're looking at the light of 7 o'clock.  Yes.  So if we start at 6, it's an hour ago.  No, we're getting lighter earlier.  Shut up.  We are.  Don't.  Don't.  Wait.  Stop.  Longer daylight for the summer.  It doesn't work.  Sure, it doesn't.  But on the tail end.  On the tail end, you get it.  At 6 in the morning, it's going to be as much light as you'd normally have at 7 in the 
[00:09:30]  morning.  Stop.  No.  But it's not going to get darker.  No.  It's going to stay the same.  No, it's not.  Hold on.  It's what it is now.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  It's going to be 5 o'clock dark at 6 o'clock.  Yeah.  No.  It's going to be 5.  It's going to be 6 o'clock.  No, that's how you gain the lightness at the end of the day.  You have to, like, take it from somewhere.  You have to take it from somewhere.  So, at, like, 5 o'clock.  Look, look.  Let's do the math again, Maureen.  Let's do it again. 
[00:10:00]  And we'll do the exact time.  It's 610 right now.  Okay.  Look outside.  It's kind of light out.  It's getting light, right?  Right, Maureen?  You're looking outside.  It's light.  Right.  Now, if we spring ahead on Monday, right now is going to be 710.  This is what 710 in the morning looks like.  710 will look just like this out the window.  So, what will an hour before that look like when we come into work?  An hour before 7?  Right.  What will that look like? 
[00:10:30]  It'll look like an hour before right now, which was pitch black.  It'll be dark.  My God, woman.  It's going to look exactly like it is now.  No, it isn't.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  I want to choke you.  Could you come down to the studio so I can choke you?  Thanks to Maureen.  We're doing poopy jokes all day.  You're doing what, Joe?  Poopy jokes.  Maureen.  Because we can't use our intelligence.  We can't use our intelligence if you can't figure this out.  Maureen, figure it out.  Really figure this out.  I've got to change it.  I've got to turn it around. 
[00:11:00]  It's going to drive me nuts.  Don't you understand that it will be 5 o'clock dark?  Jimmy's giving that look like, wait a minute.  Oh, turn down your radio.  Don't let her listen because it'll hit her twice.  It is sound.  I don't have it on.  You don't understand that it'll be an hour darker than it is right now?  I think it's going to be exactly the same it is.  How will it be exactly the same?  Could you please explain that?  No, she's saying exactly the same it is.  It is.  It is. 
[00:11:30]  How could you, could you please explain why it's going to be the same?  We've explained why it's not going to be.  You explain why it's going to be the same.  Yeah.  All right.  No, you're right.  Ah.  We love hearing that.  We turned around.  But you did confuse me.  I thought I was wrong.  You know, because it gets me every year, too.  Every year I've got to try to figure it out.  Is it darker or lighter?  I think this year I've got to figure it out, finally.  Jimmy's still confused.  Yeah, I hate daylight savings the way.  They don't do it in, I think, what, Arizona?  Arizona.  They get plenty of sunlight in Arizona.  They don't need any help. 
[00:12:00]  I know.  We need help on the East Coast.  And now with all the problems with the computers and the time changing, you know, it's a whole mess now.  They're talking about a mini Y2K.  So, considering Y2K had no problems, a mini Y2K would be...  It's going to be mini no problems.  Mini no problems.  Turn your clock and your computer.  Everything will be all right.  I read into the story, and they said, like, older computers, because they had this figured out for a while.  So, older computers won't be able to change the date. 
[00:12:30]  So, you'll just have to change it yourself.  Well, because it's three weeks early.  So, you're going to change your computer.  Yeah.  The time on your computer.  And then when it's supposed to happen, you know, that's already built into the computer.  Then you've got to change it back.  And then you've got to change it again.  That's all it is.  And then it'll really be dark out for a long time.  Because you did it twice.  All right.  Now we've got Mary, who's saying we're both sort of right.  Thank you.  Mary, what's up?  Hey, I don't want to confuse you guys.  Okay.  But each day, as we get farther into the summer, sunrise is a little earlier. 
[00:13:00]  So, we'll get lighter a little earlier.  Look, it's a minute a day, pretty much.  A minute a day.  So, we're talking by Monday, it's going to be what?  Three, four minutes?  That doesn't make an hour's worth of...  It's going to be dark when we come in.  Three seconds count.  But we're not talking about that.  We're just talking about daylight saving time.  Oh, my God.  Do we get more darkness in the morning, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  It'll be dark.  And then it gets tagged on to the tail end of the day.  So, then at like six o'clock at night, it'll be as light out as it was at like five o'clock. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Woo.  Yes.  Yes.  Just like it's going to be as dark as it was at five at six.  It's going to be light as it was.  And the rumor is they brought it three weeks earlier to save energy.  Yeah.  Oh, are we going three weeks earlier?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Three weeks earlier.  Three weeks earlier.  Why don't they just stop it?  No, I like this.  Who are you kidding?  That would ruin everything.  Fast forward to everything.  No, I like this three weeks earlier.  We ought to just cut it off. 
[00:14:00]  We'll give it actually 15 minutes.  Make the day longer by 15 minutes.  Just make it longer.  Just change everything.  All right.  We settle that.  Go 12 hours and really screw everyone up.  You've got to come to work at night.  We settle that, though.  There you go.  But look at it.  It's already light out.  Yeah.  That's kind of neat.  But not Monday.  I like it.  Knocked it to darkness again.  We've got lots to do today, but I was looking at the top Yahoo searches for today, and it's  hilarious because it's all hot pieces of asses for the most part. 
[00:14:30]  That's all anyone wants to search on the internet and the IRS because tax season is around the  corner, but your top searches, there's names like Averill Levine, Debra Lefebvre is back  on the Yahoo top search list.  Debra Lefebvre.  Wow.  She's timeless.  Sex teacher.  She is timeless.  Why are people searching her all of a sudden again?  Because she's hot.  Is that?  No.  Her name had to pop up again.  I think there was another school teacher sleeping incident. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Whenever they come up, I think you've got to pop that up.  You go, oh, who was that hot one?  Well, yeah.  She's the greatest of all time.  Oh, yeah.  Stop.  She's as big as Muhammad Ali.  Yeah.  She's the Muhammad Ali of sleeping with your students.  She's the Muhammad Ali of her sport.  Yeah.  Sleeping with your young teen students.  I don't think they'll ever catch a hotter teacher doing such naughty things.  She was so hot, the judge let her go.  Yeah.  She's that hot.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  You think these slobs that are sleeping with her, you know, you hear the story and then  you open the newspaper and go, eee, ooh, and it's just a slob.  You know she's going away.  Didn't the judge pretty much say that she's too beautiful to be in prison or something like that?  Yeah, it was something like that.  Like, you know, prison would just ruin this beautiful girl.  This specimen.  We need a specimen like this walking around.  Just let her go.  I don't care if she works at a daycare center.  She's wonderful.  So she's being searched out on Yahoo. 
[00:16:00]  Then you got Anna Nicole Smith moving down the list finally.  But still one of the top searches.  And you got IRS, I said, American Idol, WWE because you got WrestleMania coming up soon.  That was all the trace back to one IP at E-Rock's house.  He loves his wrestling.  And then number two is Britney Spears.  Top search on Yahoo.  Crazy Britney or hot Britney, I wonder.  Probably hot.  You always default to hot.  Yeah.  And then number one, Antonella Barber. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  The American Idol contestant with those R-rated photos that are all over the place.  And the X-rated photos, we proved that they're not her.  They're fake.  A week or so ago.  But she did do a couple of those little, you know, Girls Gone Wild type pictures.  Still photos of her and her friends with their tops off.  But they're kind of covered with her hands.  And sexy poses.  And little artsy, fartsy, nudie poses.  This girl is perfect for Playboy. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  She doesn't have much talent.  She's a hot piece of ass.  And they're going to give her a huge payday.  You watch.  But the funny thing is, did you watch Idol last night?  No, I saw the clips, though.  I saw all I needed to see.  Clips.  Well, Antonella Barber, she sang again last night.  She stinks.  She really is a bad singer.  She is awful.  But America is hilarious.  They're like, she's a hot piece of ass.  She's got these unbelievable pictures on the internet that you can just check by just throwing her name in a search engine.  She's more famous than the rest of them because of the publicity she's gotten. 
[00:17:30]  So that will get her through.  Right.  A few levels.  She's awful.  And finally, Simon Cowell looked at her last night and said, look, look.  He was basically pleading to America, like, look, please.  This girl doesn't deserve to be in this competition anymore.  He even said, like, you know.  He can't tell America to vote her off, but he's like, get rid of her.  Please listen to what I'm saying.  She's nowhere close to the other contestants. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, he pretty much said, you know, you can't sing.  Right.  Because I wish you could sing better.  Now.  You've handled yourself well in the news and all that.  Yeah.  Great.  Well, here she is singing last night.  Just a taste.  Listen to this.  Listen to how bad this is.  Three little birds sat on my window.  And they told me I don't need to worry.  Not even with the music. 
[00:18:30]  Summer came like cinnamon.  So sweet.  Little girls double touch on the concrete.  Maybe sometime.  She's good. 
[00:19:00]  I thought she sang a different song.  No, this is it.  She's not good.  Oh, I think she has a voice like an angel.  No.  She's getting lost in the backup vocals.  Jimmy's just looking at her pictures at the same time.  That's why he's.  She could be singing verses at a Third Reich book.  Mine comes.  I just be reporting.  Wonderful.  You think this is good? 
[00:19:30]  She's got a voice.  It's like a spring breeze.  Yeah, right.  It would be good for an audition.  But, you know, this.  This.  At this stage of the competition, it's nowhere as close to the best.  I bet she does well at like karaoke.  Guys like looking at her.  Yeah.  She, you know, she can belt one out at the local gin mill.  She'll do playboy, I bet.  Oh, she's, yeah, she's on the fast track for Playboy.  Guaranteed.  Hopefully pornography.  Would she be the first American Idol in Playboy? 
[00:20:00]  In Playboy, yeah.  Not in porno.  True.  Or some types of stuff like that.  Well.  Frenchie, her name was.  The black girl.  Stupid Rosie went on her show yesterday and said that American Idol is racist.  That crap.  And weightist.  And weightist?  Yeah.  Weightist.  What, they like the fat contestants?  Yeah, a fat black guy won.  Fat black girls are on it all the time right up until the end.  Just stop.  Well.  A gay guy won.  Yeah.  I mean, what do you want, Rosie? 
[00:20:30]  Well, Rosie.  A little cross section.  Well, here's the deal.  There was this contestant called, named Frenchie.  And she had some crazy photographs that were on the internet as well, just like this Antonella.  Uh, and she got kicked off American Idol for having all these, uh, you know, uh, in her  case, x-rated pictures on the internet.  She was, uh, licking and doing all sorts of things.  Let's just put it that way.  And Rosie's making the connection that it's the same.  It's not the same.  No, I guess there's a line.  The one has pictures of hardcore porn, and this Antonella Barbara has kind of a model 
[00:21:00]  showing a little bit, wet t-shirt type, uh, type shots.  Yeah, you're really not seeing anything, uh, you wouldn't see going down to the beach.  So, uh, you know, Rosie's making a little stretch there, calling American Idol racist.  Mm-hmm.  It's two completely different, uh, things going on there.  I think John said that, like, a few seasons ago, too, when some, uh, uh, black contestant  got voted off, and he said, oh, it's racist, and that season, yeah, a black contestant  wound up winning.  I think it was, uh, what's his name? 
[00:21:30]  Fatty.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, Ruben.  Yeah, remember him?  Whatever.  All right, so, uh, here's Randy and Paula judging Antonella last night.  The, the clip, the good clip is coming up with Simon.  So that was a pretty good song, Joyce.  I mean, that's a cool song.  Karim Bailey Ray joined us.  Cool song.  And it was a nice ending you did, but it was still a little pitchy in the middle there.  I just, I always feel like the last couple of weeks that you don't quite believe you.  You're actually a better singer, I think, than you've shown, so, it's just another okay  performance for me.  I don't know.  Um, I think it was the right song choice for you, and where you stand right now with your 
[00:22:00]  range.  Um, bottom notes, you're gonna, you're gonna have to watch out for when you hit into the  higher range, it's when your, your magic was there.  Oh, brother.  But, I think you picked the right song.  Your magic?  Yeah.  I hate Paula, cause she has to say something nice about every contestant.  We get it.  You're the nice one.  Stop already.  Yeah.  Your boots look nice. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  And then, and half the time, like, Paula will go, uh, and you, and you're a beautiful girl.  Yeah.  Like, first, let me just say, you're so sweet.  Oh, boy.  Beautiful people don't want to be, don't want you to say how beautiful they are when you're  trying to show off another talent.  Yeah.  When the best you could say is, look, you're a beautiful girl.  Like, the person already knows that.  They want to know, look, can I sing?  Look, the best thing you have is a commodity that will fade over time.  Um, congrats. 
[00:23:00]  Godspeed.  Well, here's Simon just killing her.  I know.  You've gone, you've gone as far as you can go, Antonella.  I mean, the reality is, and I think you know this yourself, which is, you are surrounded  by some pretty amazing girl singers.  Um, and I don't know how much more you can do, to be honest with you, because I don't  think your voice is going to get any better.  Um, and, you know, I, I feel for you, because you've taken a lot of stick in the media.  I think you've handled yourself well throughout. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And I don't think anyone should be playing that situation.  You go, girl.  But, I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna patronize you here.  It wasn't, it was, it wasn't your worst.  We've heard you sound worse.  But, I just have a problem here, which is, you know, I just wish you could sing better.  Yeah.  Yeah, he does, because she's a hot piece of ass.  They like to see her come out there every week.  Yeah.  And stupid Randy chimes in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he's trying.  That's what he said.  But the funny thing is, America's gonna vote her through. 
[00:24:00]  I think she'll make it through.  She's gonna be voted through, because she's a hot piece of ass.  She's a celebrity.  And, and everyone is searching her on the internet, man.  Yeah.  I'm gonna laugh so hard tomorrow when they vote her through.  Oh, she'll get through.  Should we have our listeners vote for her, or what?  Of course.  I, I encourage you to, uh, to vote for Antonella Barber.  Mm-hmm.  If you're one of these, uh, American Idol voters.  If you're taking the time to vote.  I can't see how she can make it through.  Like, she's, she's just, it's reached that point where she's gotten more press than anybody else. 
[00:24:30]  You know, she's like in the public eye more.  So, that just, by nature, people will vote for you.  Yeah.  Her voice is deliciously melodic.  Oh, you like that?  I do.  I think she's terrific.  She's a lovely, a lovely little to it.  It's like a, it's like, it's like a, it's like a, a cloud blowing over a spring field.  Ah, is it?  Is it really?  I like that she just has the ability to, um, just miss every note.  Right.  Just misses. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, she goes through, though, because, uh.  Those are the fake ones.  Yeah.  Name, name one other contestant on American Idol.  Exactly.  Exactly.

[00:25:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  And thanks for giving us a listen.  We're loving Chicago and New York right now.  Yeah.  Loving you guys.  I know there's love in other cities.  I understand that.  I could feel it.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-3.  We were just talking about American Idol.  It was quick. 
[00:26:00]  We got the rosy clip.  It was in front of me.  I didn't see it, but, uh, claiming that, uh, American Idol is racist.  Yeah, because they didn't kick little Antonella off.  Uh, but they kicked Frenchie off.  Frenchie was a big black contestant, and she had some photos on a porn site.  Yeah, and she was doing some hardcore stuff.  She was doing some, yeah, big-time hardcore stuff.  And Antonella, it's a little whoopsie.  Antonella's like, ooh, look at me.  I'm a hot college girl.  I'm with my friends at spring break, and I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna take my top off 
[00:26:30]  but cover it with my hands.  I feel bad for the fat pig that she was photographed with.  Oh, I know.  There's one picture.  I've been studying these pictures, because you gotta be up on this stuff when you do a  morning talk show, and, uh, yeah, is that the picture from spring break?  Yeah.  And Antonella's like, oh my god, you're taking my picture?  Ooh, I gotta cover up.  Ooh, let me cover up.  Ooh.  And right next to her is her huge, fat friend doing the exact same thing.  Yeah, it doesn't quite work out.  No, it doesn't have the same effect.  You kinda wanna throw a blanket over her. 
[00:27:00]  Antonella, you're like, you're liking that she doesn't know how to cover everything up.  Yeah.  She's got small hands, and her boobs might be a little too big, so she doesn't know what  to cover.  The other girl's just a mess.  She's fat, and she's a bad hairline, her friend.  Oh, yeah.  A bad hairline.  Big, huge thighs.  She doesn't have, like, Jason Alexander.  And then the other girls, uh, to the left of Antonella, they're okay, too.  Yeah, she's with her hot friends. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, three out of four, not bad.  They're just speedboating, topless.  You know, she's a young girl.  She's a young girl, just exploring, experimenting.  It's not like Frenchie was there, uh, you know, she was doing some stuff that you see  in porno movies.  That's right.  Yeah, there's a million girls like this out there.  Yeah.  Spring break, getting a little crazy, getting a little copless.  There's a line, you know, if you're going to throw off every girl that's done little  things like this, you're not going to have any girls left on your show.  Pictures from a wet t-shirt contest, moms and shots where she's wearing really hot 
[00:28:00]  outfits, all that's fine.  It's fine.  Yeah, but Rosie has a problem and thinks, uh, of course, there's some kind of agenda.  Speaking of compromise, Frenchie Davis, a little bit upset that this Antonio  Tonella Barbara, what's her name?  Tonella Barbara.  Thank you for helping me.  I don't read well.  She, um, she is on the internet, right?  Apparently in scantily clad.  Yeah, apparently she's like in a wet t-shirt contest or I don't know if it's really her.  And Frenchie also was kicked off the show, though, because she was on an adult-themed 
[00:28:30]  website.  And why is it that Frenchie was kicked off, but this girl is not?  Because.  Why?  Why?  Let's see.  Because Frenchie's licking box?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  That's one way to put it.  Well, how stupid is Rosie?  There's a drastic difference.  Mm-hmm.  The one girl's doing hardcore porn and the other one's doing, like, just kind of oopsie  shots.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  She was kicked off, but this girl is not.  Because wasn't Frenchie making money off of her photos?  And this girl's just doing it out of kind spirit.  Maybe Frenchie needed money.  And that's why, I mean, they're still doing the exact same thing, whether you're paid for  it or not, doesn't that make it, it doesn't change it.  I didn't make the rule.  I'm just, I think that was their justification.  I don't know if they've altered the rule since.  I think it's racist.  They haven't really mentioned anything about this, auntie.  I really do.  I think it's because she's black.  Really?  That they could, yes.  Is it because, you know, that Antonella, she's so just kind of, yeah, she's hot.  Well, then it's weightless, too.  It's weightless and wasis, you squooly wabbit. 
[00:29:30]  It's wasis for kids.  What a want.  Wow.  It's not racist.  It's two completely different things.  Wait, why did she go from an Elmer Fudd impression to a Trix is for kids and then an Elmer  Fudd laugh?  She's stupid.  Why?  That made no sense whatsoever.  She got big laughs, though, from the audience.  She's doing something right.  Quicks are for kids.  That's not part of the Elmer Fudd thing. 
[00:30:00]  No, it's not.  Oh, my goodness.  Cross-reference your cartoon characters like that.  She, obviously, she protested too much, and she probably finds Antonella very attractive.  Her being a lesbian would love to maybe take her to bed or something, and knowing that  will never happen, she resents her.  That's my psychological thing.  Wow.  So, and she could relate more with Frenchie, who was fat, and, you know. 
[00:30:30]  Slobby.  Yeah.  Sloppenly.  Sloth-like.  I like the word slobby.  Slob.  And, you know, she can relate to her a little more, and she's a little jealous.  Yeah, I don't know.  So, we'll see what happens.  I don't think she gets voted off, though.  No.  Let's move on.  It's Seth from yesterday.  Seth, what's up?  No, nothing's up, but I agree with the fact that the only reason she's going to win or  even move on in the next round is because she's a sweet ass. 
[00:31:00]  Okay?  That's the only thing I understood.  That the only reason she's going to win or move on is because she's a sweet ass?  Antonella?  Yeah.  You think she's hot?  Are you allowed to ask an 11-year-old boy if he thinks an older woman's hot?  Of course.  Sure.  And vice versa.  You think she's hot?  Yes.  Yeah, I do.  I do think she's hot.  You do?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah?  Any girls in school that you like that you think are hot? 
[00:31:30]  Some of it.  Well, some of the 7th graders are hot.  Yeah.  But none of the 6th graders are really hot.  No, huh?  Yeah.  So the girls are much hotter in the 7th grade?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, and the ones that are seniors are, of course, the hottest in the 11th graders.  Seniors?  Oh, you like the older girls a little bit?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  You got yourself a girlfriend, Seth? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  No, I don't.  No, you're playing the field, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of leave yourself open there, whatever chick wants to come around.  You're game.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hear you.  All right, Seth.  Go to school today, will you?  Get to school, for God's sake.  You know what?  What?  Today, I get to miss school, and as I do for the rest of the week, because I have very  nice, long, blonde hair, and my school has lice. 
[00:32:30]  Jesus.  Wait, Seth has long, blonde hair, and your school has lice, so you get to miss school for a week?  Yep.  How cool is that?  Did you wind up getting lice, or are you not going because of the lice?  Well, I had lice a couple of times, but don't worry, I don't have them anymore, because we  kind of infected my brain with toxins.  What happened?  Wait, what happened to your brain?  Lice shampoo.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Right?  It got into your brain?  Hey, Seth.  Yeah?  Help us out here.  You had lice, you used the shampoo, and what happened?  The toxins went into your brain?  Like, it's really odd, because the shampoo is toxic.  Yeah.  And it's like, and it's all, it's even gross.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And when you get a little older, you're going to have to use some other type of shampoo, 
[00:33:30]  so.  Don't worry about it.  Get used to it.  Aw, poor kid, man.  He's got lice.  What the hell?  I don't get that whole lice thing.  This is the first time I've had lice in my entire life.  Really?  Where do you go to school, Seth?  Calcutta?  Calcutta.  Well, don't, don't, don't say.  My mom.  Yeah, don't say.  My brother.  All right.  It sucks.  Yeah.  Wow, so your whole family has lice now?  Well, no.  My brother and my dad, just me and my mom.  Because my mom works at the school I go to.  She's a tech teacher.  Oh.  Which is pretty cool. 
[00:34:00]  Except for the fact that you're from misbehaving.  Yeah, they could go right to your mom and rat you out.  Yeah.  All right.  Seth.  Thank you, kids.  Well, good luck with the lice, okay?  Yeah, good luck with the lice and.  Oh, yeah.  I have a question for Opie.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Where are my Islanders tickets?  I want to go to a game with you.  Scram, kid.  You want to give Opie lice?  Scram.  Oh, you hung up on little Seth.  Here's the reality, Seth, if you're still listening.  I would have gave you a ticket for the fine game tonight, 
[00:34:30]  Islanders-Rangers at the Coliseum, but you have lice.  You can't be.  Or you would have went to the game.  I'm not taking no kid with lice.  Back to the locker room to meet the team and everything.  But you have lice.  I don't get that lice thing.  You ever have lice?  I've never had lice.  Did your school have lice?  No.  What is lice?  It's bugs in your head.  In your hair.  It's like little tiny bugs that are in your hair.  Is lice innocent crabs? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  It's crabs for kids.  It's crabs for kids?  Right.  I'm serious.  Crabs for kids.  It gets in their hair and they've got to use...  Is it pretty much the same thing or no?  They jump around a lot more.  Crabs are kind of like stuck to you and lice leap about and more frolicking.  Yeah, more frolicking.  They're younger in spirit.  Like the kids they're on.  Oh, lice.  So lice is gay.  No.  Lice is just...  Well, you said frolicking and dancing and the jumping around.  Well, no.  It's just, you know...  You heard it here.  It's a younger thing.  Are gay. 
[00:35:30]  Lice aren't gay.  Yeah, they are.  They're all male and they all own little dogs together.  See one jump off with a little bowl of broth in his hand, wearing a robe.  Everyone's asking about South Park.  Yes, we did see South Park.  Yes, we have the audio coming up.  So stick around.  But we do have a potential story of the month.  Story of the month?  Story of the month, yes.  Another candidate.  Yeah, we're keeping track.  Very hard to get in, though.  We played the story of the month a few times.  We're not going to play it here.  Maybe the next time we got a potential story that's better, we'll play the actual story 
[00:36:00]  of the month.  But, well, the story of the month is principal arrested for meth caught watching gay porn  in office.  He was smoking drugs, selling drugs, watching porn, naked, with marital aids.  Yeah.  Gay porn.  That is the story of the month.  We got this little ditty.  Is this better than the story of the month that we just mentioned?  If you drive past this home, be prepared for what you might see.  You're trying not to look. 
[00:36:30]  You know he's there.  I personally have seen him six or seven times.  This woman came to team two looking for help after lodging numerous complaints about what  she was seeing.  He's naked and he wants to be seen.  Woo!  Naked.  Completely naked.  The dog commented, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was dog fur.  Yeah.  That's dog fur.  Sick!  Woo!  All right.  He's naked and he wants to be seen.  Woo!  Naked. 
[00:37:00]  Completely naked.  His na...  Wow, you hear the reporter?  Naked.  Completely naked.  Oh.  They know what sells.  Woof.  Woof to you, too, doggy.  Dog said, I concur.  Doesn't naked just mean without clothing completely?  Naked.  Complete.  Completely naked.  Yeah, naked is naked.  How can he be more without...  How can he be completely without clothes already without clothes?  It's just...  It's there to make it sound hotter.  Naked.  Completely naked.  Totally. 
[00:37:30]  Because at this point...  Completely hotly naked.  Because at this point, you don't know who's naked.  So it's the reporter's job to pull you in and make it as hot as possible.  He's trying to titillate.  Like, uh, young teenage girl naked.  Ooh.  Completely naked.  Completely.  See how much hotter that just got?  Woof.  But so far, this is a hot story because they haven't told you who's naked.  Yeah.  And the reporter's really selling it.  The dog is helping out.  Everyone is really, really into the nudity here.  The dog. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, it takes a drastic turn.  Naked and he wants to be seen.  Woof.  Naked.  Completely naked.  His name is Jimmy Mack McKenzie.  He turns 60 next month.  Neighbors say he's been strutting his stuff in front of them since he was in his 40s.  He's standing out there.  It'll be in the summer and the spring and the rain and the heat.  It doesn't matter.  It's 20 years.  Yeah.  Guy's been doing this for that long?  Absolutely.  And they're just catching on?  That's what sucks, man.  You finally get your dream of owning a home and you're right next to someone like that. 
[00:38:30]  Crazy old naked guy.  For the rest of your life.  You got a 30-year mortgage.  You're like, oh, great.  Oh, what did I move next door to?  Great.  I have to deal with this.  It's your nice neighbors.  And you're building fences and everything and it doesn't matter.  Well, the reporter tries to confront the naked 60-year-old neighbor.  And what about McKenzie himself?  Your neighbors say that you're running around naked in front of people, little kids included. 
[00:39:00]  No.  Will you come talk to us about it?  No.  Oh, that isn't crazy old guy talk.  No.  No.  My health won't allow it.  No.  No.  No.  Will you come talk to us about it?  No.  But we only waited outside his home 10 minutes to see the so-called naked neighbor come out in his red and revealing briefs. 
[00:39:30]  Neighbors say that's how it starts.  He struts out in his underwear and then pulls them off.  One of his favorite times to go full, Monty, they say, is in the afternoon.  Just in time for the Rainier school bus.  Oh, man.  Wow.  This guy is, he's screwy.  That's classic.  Where do you just lose your mind like that and decide you're going to do that? 
[00:40:00]  How are you not in jail when you're in front of a school bus for 20 years?  Maybe because he's on his own property?  I don't know.  Nah, you can't do that.  Well, let's find out.  Yeah.  We got some more audio here.  We've had numerous complaints, yes.  And they're all of these just walking around naked.  But that's not illegal.  Officials from the Columbia County Sheriff's Department say McKenzie can walk all the way down his driveway stark naked.  It doesn't matter who sees him.  Right up to the mailbox.  And there's nothing they can do about it. 
[00:40:30]  And that's what neighbors say McKenzie does quite often.  Strolls all the way to his mailbox on Brownlee Road completely nude.  I don't like it a whole lot.  But Lieutenant Jerry Simmons says his deputies can't do a thing about it.  We have to do what the law says.  If he is walking around trying to arouse himself or others, then that is a crime.  Oh, okay.  That's it.  So as long as you're not...  He's not doing it for any sexual purpose.  As long as you're not fiddling.  Yeah, no fiddling. 
[00:41:00]  As long as you don't do any of that fiddling, you're fine.  Don't fiddle.  Just walk to your mailbox.  You could be naked in your own property.  How great is that?  Who knew?  We got to test this out is what I'm thinking.  I wish I could afford the place right next to Anthony.  I would just do nude jumping jacks.  You can't do that.  Why not?  You would be arrested.  That's it, lady.  Because you'd always be in a state.  They'd look at my body and go, there's no way he could think this arouses anyone.  And the instant feedback is loving the no.  That no is classic.  Bert from Philly and a few others saying the same thing. 
[00:41:30]  No!  No!  Wow, we got to test out this theory.  Yeah, where is that?  Because certain laws may vary in certain places.  Do we know where the story's coming out of?  We'll find out.  We got to test the theory, obviously, with hot women.  Hot, bodacious women.  I just want women to walk up and down their driveway to their mailbox all morning long.  Is the fact that they're hot alone like titillating?  Because this guy's like 60 years old.  I'm sure they don't look at him and think, you know, ooh. 
[00:42:00]  Right, right.  But if it's a hot woman, perhaps that in itself is titillating.  That's sexist.  Of course it is.  As long as there's no fiddling going on.  Yeah, we should give that a try.  Yeah, we got to learn a little bit today.  I know learning is for queers, but we got to get to the bottom of this one because we want to try this one out.  So we want to get some hot women to just walk up and down their driveways.  Get the mail naked.  Yeah, get the mail naked is the bit.  Although the mail's delivered in the afternoon for the most part. 
[00:42:30]  Get your newspaper.  Yeah, there you go.  Get the morning newspaper naked.  Just walk to your curb naked.  Maybe we could try it out today.  Maybe someone is willing to try it out today.  Not in New York because it's freezing, although that would make it even funnier.  We got more to the story.  But some of McKinsey's neighbors say it's much more than a birthday parade.  When we told them that we had seen this gentleman outside in his driveway, they said, well...  All right, what did we...  What was bleeped? 
[00:43:00]  She called him a MF.  Oh, really?  No, I don't...  I guarantee you it was because he was aroused.  Oh, really?  I'm guessing.  No?  No.  Oh.  That he was fiddling.  Oh, okay.  That perhaps he was fiddling.  Okay.  And outside in his driveway, they said, well, you know, the first time they said, well,  we'll send somebody out, but we're busy today.  Team 2 has obtained police and court records showing McKinsey was charged with public indecency  three times between 1989 and 2004. 
[00:43:30]  According to records at the state appeals court, he also admitted to molesting a toddler.  In 2005, McKinsey was arrested again.  This time, he was charged with 50 counts of encouraging child sexual abuse.  Well...  Oh, my God.  Dude, I was just thinking about this yesterday.  50 counts?  Is that because a bus went by and, like...  And he's...  And he's doing that, so it's like encouraging...  He's doing more than just standing there naked. 
[00:44:00]  Let's just put it that way.  That sounds like a charge that they had to come up with.  And that's what sucks.  You buy a house and you're stuck with this guy for, like I said, 30 years.  I was thinking yesterday, man, every day there's another story in the paper about some pervert.  Yeah.  And it's usually something with kids.  There's a story today about a mom walking into her apartment somewhere in New York.  Her 13-year-old daughter is topless, and the repairman, I forgot what job he was doing, is there trying to talk the girl into some kind of sexual act. 
[00:44:30]  And the mom just grabs her daughter like, what the hell's going on?  And yanks her out of the apartment, and then the guy gets arrested.  But every day there's a story in the local paper.  Wow.  It doesn't matter what city.  It's an epidemic.  Yeah.  Was it always, I wonder?  Was it always, but just not reported?  I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's one of those things that gets people paying attention.  Like if there's a kiddie porn story on the news you're watching, because everyone has kids or obviously know someone with kids. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Or if it's in the paper, you're reading those stories before you're reading about how gas prices are going up.  Everyone can get behind that, too, and just look and go, what a creep.  Like, what a ghoul.  They convicted that guy that killed that girl in Florida.  Oh, Cooey, Paul Cooey.  Oh.  Yeah.  What a, ugh.  He, what, kidnapped her, raped her, and then buried her alive?  Oh, horrible story.  Yeah.  That bastard. 
[00:45:30]  They should just give the father a pistol and just let him execute him.  Yeah, let him do it.  Cast rid of him.  I mean, come on.  Let's get a little archaic with the laws here and with the executions.  Let the guy do it.  And then you got the people that are against execution.  And you see a story like that on the paper.  Yeah, why should that guy live?  And I don't feel like arguing the point all morning.  Like, just logically, it doesn't make sense that you would think that it's fine.  This guy should live.  Yeah.  Don't tell me it costs more to blah, blah.  I don't care.  Yeah, who cares?  It's, it's...  You get the guy off the earth.  You know what?  The family sleeps at night a little bit. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, it's vengeance.  And she was nine and he buried her alive.  How do you...  How do you not think this guy should die?  This guy's going to turn around in prison?  And if it costs more to put someone to death, well, let's spend the money.  How about this?  You stop forgiving foreign debts for favors.  You make them pay what they owe.  We take that money and put a few people to death.  And people think the life in prison thing is, you know, well, he'll never see the light  of day again.  He's going to be in prison, locked up.  It's a social club.  People make of their life whatever it is.  So whether you're living high on the hog or you're in prison, that's your life. 
[00:46:30]  You have to live it.  You have moments of happiness, moments of sadness.  You got your good times, your bad times.  It's the same thing in prison.  That just becomes your life.  So after, you know, the initial, I don't know how many years it would take, but it just  becomes that is now what you're doing.  Yeah.  That's how you live your life.  And it's no more, it's not a punishment.  You have your wants, you want to be free, but everyone's got what they want in life  and can't attain.  So for them, it's freedom. 
[00:47:00]  But the rest of their life is just their existing.  That's why I don't believe that life in prison is quite as much a punishment for these people  as a lot of people think.  Just kill them.  This guy's worthless.  We could take calls from people that did some time in jail and it would piss off a lot of  people because I think the average person has no idea how prison really is.  And how it's not as bad as you'd think in your mind.  I'm just thinking, I'm sorry, I'm kind of quite excited because Voss is coming in. 
[00:47:30]  I'm just thinking of how he would, how he's going to try to talk about this.  Oh, his spin on it.  Like, you know, when it comes to kids, you're going to put a little stupid hand up and try  to like, maybe like a kid advocate.  And you're just going to all of a sudden side with the pedophiles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll turn everyone around.  Yeah.  They should let him go.  Here's the last bit of the story.  Deputies say they searched his home and found boxes and computer hard drives stuffed with  child pornography.  This guy was charged with kiddie porn. 
[00:48:00]  And you're telling me he's not showing an interest in the children on the school bus.  Where else are you going to get that big an audience?  Yeah, man.  He's playing giant stadium.  Yeah.  As far as pedophiles go.  There you go.  He's playing giant stadium.  I got to be naked.  Right.  I'll go get the mail naked.  Some publicity.  How you doing, kids?  If you're a pedophile, that's got to be the greatest gig you could get. 
[00:48:30]  Naked in your driveway in front of a school bus to go with children.  Yeah.  How does it get any better than that?  How does that?  What the hell is this if he's got kiddie porn on his computer?  What's wrong with this guy?  How are you?  Why are you so crazy about it?  If you have child porn, why are you naked in the front?  Yeah.  Why are you not in jail?  Why are the neighbors not stomping his brains out?  But why not just kind of keep it under your hat?  Yeah.  Not to be naked when you have...  Literally.  Just walk out with a hat over it.  All right. 
[00:49:00]  We got to take a break.  Right.  That's not story of the month.  It got sad.  No.  No.  It got kind of sad.  Sad.  No!  It started out kind of funny.  No!  I thought it was just some old codger.  Yeah.  Just walking around nude.  Cute little old guy.  I was thinking he was doing it for the neighbors and stuff.  Maybe the hot wife left behind.  As the husband goes to work.  You know.  All the kids look and laugh when they drive by.  Right.  Like the adults are like, oh, it's shocking.  The children, they're passing by on the bus. 
[00:49:30]  If that was me, every day passing by, we just all would look and point and laugh.  Look at the old naked guy again.  He's out.  He's out.  Everybody goes over to one side of the bus.  Right.  Bus is ready to tip over.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  It'd be traumatizing.  It'd be funny.  Yep.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Virus. 
[00:50:00]  Kind of scary.  We got a lot of ex-cons calling our show right now.  Whoa.  Well, now we know where our audience is.  We just found our audience.  We kind of said before the break that this life in prison is not, it's no big deal to  some people.  It just becomes the reality that is your life and you lead it.  You know, obviously we would think it would be a horrible thing to go into prison, anyone  who's not in prison. 
[00:50:30]  But then once you're in there, that is your life.  So you have to live it.  So it becomes a thing that isn't as bad as people who aren't in prison think it is.  I spent one night in jail and it's just a terrifying reality.  Yeah.  Terrifying.  Especially when you look like I do.  I mean...  Oh.  Yeah.  Cute.  It's frightening.  I mean, I'm not a tough looking guy.  No.  Soft little idiot.  Yeah.  Terrible.  But over time you would just, that would become whatever. 
[00:51:00]  You would be a muscle head.  You would just take it?  I'd take it.  I mean, I'd try to go pay, cut that out.  Well, the word head would come in probably, but I don't think muscle would really be...  Sir, my first name isn't Gimme.  What is the reality?  If like all three of us were in prison doing a hard time, like what would happen?  Would you just give in, Jimmy?  No.  Would you just fight to the end?  Well, I don't know.  I'd probably object loudly.  I'd be objecting and lifting as much weight as humanly possible. 
[00:51:30]  Hoping that eventually it goes away.  I'd do what I did in school.  I'd be the funny guy.  And hope that gets you through it.  I hope that works.  And then I'd join the Aryans.  And get some swastika tattoos.  Join them.  They'd probably tell you you're too radical.  Ed would shave his head the first night.  Who are you kidding?  Who are you kidding?  Some tats.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Dee in Connecticut.  Dee, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You were in prison? 
[00:52:00]  No, actually, I'm a CEO.  I work there.  Oh, a CEO.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  What do you got?  As you were saying before, these guys don't have it that bad.  A couple years go by.  They get settled in.  They got TV.  They got all the local channels.  They're sitting there.  They're watching wrestling, NASCAR, baseball, NFL, the news, everything.  I don't think it's a big deal if you could sit around and discuss what happened on American Idol last night.  Yeah, they could do that.  I think that's a little better than killing somebody.  And then they have a lot of things that occupy their time. 
[00:52:30]  And I don't think it's so much because they want to give these prisoners so much to do as it is they don't want them rioting or doing things to the guards.  So they occupy their time with things like school.  They have libraries.  These guys decide to become lawyers and work on their own cases.  So they're using their time.  They're not sitting there toiling and thinking about what they did.  This horrible crime of murdering a girl and burying her alive.  This guy, you know, he's going to be in there watching TV, doing that. 
[00:53:00]  Of course, it will probably cross his mind every so often.  But there's so much to do in there.  And they give them so much to do so they don't riot and kill guards and stuff.  It's not that big of a deal if you could get lost in a book.  Yeah.  Let me just get lost in a book.  You know, here's a guy that kidnapped, raped a little girl, buried her alive.  But fast forward maybe a few months, he's going to just be in his cell lost in a book.  Yeah, just, ah, I'm reading. 
[00:53:30]  Well, just lost in a book.  Turning pages and laying down.  And these people against the death penalty, they just don't get it.  They don't get it.  And they go, well, it has nothing to do with justice.  It's just retribution and revenge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Sometimes that's good enough.  And in this case, like Jimmy said, the father should absolutely be able to just kill the guy when something like that happens.  And it's usually people who are not, not always, but like, you know, obviously his son was murdered.  It's usually people who are not the parents of murdered children who are like completely anti-death penalty. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right, D, thank you.  Yeah, one more thing, guys.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Another thing.  A lot of the guys that are in there don't want visitors from the outside because they don't want that reality of what's going on.  Yeah, because they got their own reality in there and it's working for them.  And then once a visitor comes in, they realize, oh, yeah, there's an outside.  All right, guys.  I'm putting it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to John from Florida, another CEO.  What's up, John?  Hey, how are you guys doing this morning? 
[00:54:30]  Hi.  Hey.  All right.  Yeah, like the other guy was saying, you know, these guys, they have it so freaking easy.  I mean, they got more rights than we do, for crying out loud.  Yeah.  You know, they're allowed to complain about us.  You know, they're allowed to sit there and write us up, you know, and get us in trouble, you know, for doing our job.  Yeah, and that seems like something like busy work.  Like, just to pass the time, why not complain about a CO, write out a complaint?  You know, that'll kill my day.  You know, there's another day down the tubes that I could just mark off with my piece of chalk on the wall in my 1800s jail cell. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, exactly.  What am I, an idiot?  These guys, you know, like the lifers, you know, they have, you know, they don't even really care about what goes on in the prison because they're there for life, so they don't really give a shit.  But the short-timers, you know, it's the guys that aren't in there for that long that, you know, make all the trouble and everything else, you know.  Yeah.  The ones that end up coming back and coming back until they finally do end up killing somebody.  Yeah, the guys that are in there for a long time, they don't care.  That's their life.  And you get used to your surroundings no matter what. 
[00:55:30]  It becomes your life.  People are very adaptable.  Well, and you're adapting to prison life.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  You know, and then there's guys that can't adapt to prison and, you know, sit there and cry at night and say, oh, you know, I don't deserve to be here and da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Then the guards beat him to death.  Yeah.  And someone wins a bet.  All right, Ryan.  Thank you.  John, I'm sorry, John.  Good morning, guys.  Ryan, on instant feedback, this is very rare, so we've got to stop the show and point it out.  Oh, Ryan from Minnesota, Anthony, murdering a girl and burying her alive. 
[00:56:00]  Come on, man.  Anthony's rarely, rarely wrong.  Murdering a girl and burying her alive.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  I think how dumb I am.  I didn't catch it when you said it or when I just read it.  I didn't see it.  What's wrong with that?  That is awful.  Wow.  How did he do that?  Brought her back to life.  Just to do it.  Here you go.  Let's say hi to Pittsburgh.  Paying a little attention to Pittsburgh.  Jimmy's going to be in Pittsburgh starting tonight at the Improv, right?  Tonight through Sunday, yeah.  Let's say hi to Eric. 
[00:56:30]  Eric, what's up?  I get rape and murder mixed up.  You're the greatest.  Huh?  Hey, my daughter's mother, first of all, was never married to her.  She goes to prison.  She's in prison for about eight months.  She writes my daughter a letter for the first time.  And the first thing she says is, who do you think is going to win American Idol?  That Chris.  He's real hot.  That Chris is real hot.  Yeah.  So what's that prove to you how easy prison is?  I think if you can watch TV, then prison is a breeze.  Yeah.  It really is. 
[00:57:00]  Then she draws her a picture with these beautiful crayons and markers.  And I guess I don't let them have that.  I like to simplify everything around me.  If you can watch TV in prison, then it's a cakewalk.  That's a breeze.  Because that's what we pretty much do during our lives on the outside.  Here is the only thing that's bad about prison.  Hold on two seconds.  The only thing bad about the prison is that you don't want to get raped.  Yeah.  In between shows, you're looking over your shoulder. 
[00:57:30]  That's pretty much it.  Because if the show is interesting enough, even the rapists are watching.  They're going to wait for a commercial break or something.  So you can even focus on the show.  Commercial comes.  Because you're looking around like, oh, boy, what's going to happen?  Oh, boy.  But that really is the only thing that would keep a lot of people from going to prison.  Right.  Because it seems very structured.  Some people like that structured lifestyle.  You got TV.  You got people telling you what you got to do.  There's activities.  It's like camp.  Yeah.  But with the, you know, rape, it's bad camp.  It's still like camp.  Well, some people like football camps. 
[00:58:00]  And let's be honest.  Let's be honest.  That just makes your day a little more exciting.  Wondering.  Yeah.  Wondering.  Yeah.  Maybe some people, that spices it up.  You never know.  You never know what's over your shoulder.  You should.  It depends on your crime.  I mean, if you are a guy that's going to get back in.  If you're an armed robber or something like that, I mean, you should have a library and  ways to improve your life a little bit because you're going to be coming back out anyway.  But, you know, anything with kids, they should just be, their conditions should, it should  be barbarism.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Their conditions should be just inhumane. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Old school, medieval.  Absolutely.  Black and white TVs, you know.  Yeah.  Sam in Pittsburgh, what's up?  Rabbit ears.  Sam.  Yeah.  Give them three channels.  Static in the middle of their shows.  A black and white TV with three channels.  That's gruesome.  Sam, what's up?  Hey.  Those are the two beanbags took every word I wanted to tell you about.  See?  Prison, but I'll tell you a different aspect.  When you got gay guys coming into the prison, that's a whole different story, guys.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, man. 
[00:59:00]  It's like apple pie given to a monkey.  I mean, these monkeys, they sniff out these gay guys, man.  And we had the biggest problem with these beanbags coming in.  And, I mean, they would volunteer to do stupid stuff, you know what I mean, to get in trouble,  to get isolated with some of these guys.  So they would be isolated with other men so they can be sexually molested.  Well, you know, they'd jump on a trampoline without the trampoline. 
[00:59:30]  You follow me?  Oh, boy, yeah.  So, wait, the gay guys wanted to be isolated or the other guys wanted to be with the gay guys?  Well, the homosexual, what would happen was when you get in trouble, you get isolated into, like, a certain part of the jail.  Meaning, you got your Hispanics on one side and you got your blacks on one side.  And I don't care what any other CEO will tell you, that happens because you can't mix them sometimes.  You follow me?  Yeah.  And these guys would come in here and say a white guy would come in, right? 
[01:00:00]  He'd be a gay guy or a Hispanic or whatever.  He'd come in and he'd figure out which one of those three holes had any gay guys in there.  So then he'd start complaining about the sale that he was in, you know.  He'd make trouble with somebody in there.  Then he'd get put into another sale, you know, depending on what he did.  And eventually, they'd get the gay guys.  They'd sniff each other out.  And we'd come in, you know. 
[01:00:30]  You got to hurry up, Sam.  I mean, you're talking like you're doing the time yourself.  Yeah, right?  Oh, my God.  Wow, I felt like I was doing a sentence.  Holy crap.  I nodded off.  I'm trying to get thrown into another radio show for 10 minutes.  Yeah, we...  I wish he would.  Well, don't bring him back.  They took everything I was going to tell you about him, you know?  Obviously.  I have no idea what this guy was trying to say.  I know.  I phased out for a second.  I phased out.  So the gay guys...  If the guy wants to be isolated with gay, he'll find out blacks, whites, and hispanics are 
[01:01:00]  all sectioned off in these isolation places.  And the guy will get thrown in the hole.  He'll kind of understand where the gay guy is.  So he'll have a problem with...  All right.  Actually, I was going to say you talk.  You would know, but you would.  But you're just not...  So it's his goal to get in a cell with a gay guy?  Yes.  To beat him up or just to have relations?  All right.  To have relations.  Then you're going to have some sex.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  You could have done that in 10 seconds.  Some of that prison sex.  Jimmy wrapped it up in no time.  Absolutely.  And I made it a hot little attractive packet.  Right. 
[01:01:30]  John in Dub Bronx.  What's up, John?  I almost crashed my car listening to that last caller.  No kidding.  Getting a lot of Zs on the instant feedback.  Oh, my God.  Listen, as far as law enforcement's concerned, there's a lot of things those cops in that  area could do to that old man because nobody entertains complaints from a pedophile.  No, they don't care about it.  So you think the cops could do a thing or two?  All I'm going to say is I can't get into specifics because the statutes of limitations aren't 
[01:02:00]  over yet, but nobody entertains complaints with a pedophile.  Everybody hates him.  The most liberal person in the world does not care about a pedophile.  And they certainly hate him in the joint.  I don't know about that.  Yeah, they put him in protective custody.  Is that a myth, though, or is that the truth?  I did hear one case where they tattooed the victim's name, a little girl's name, on the  guy's face.  Is that true?  Did we talk about that?  Yeah.  They tattooed her name on his face?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:02:30]  Let's say hi to Neil in Stanford.  Neil, what's up?  We got a hot topic.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I love you guys.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  I did time in Connecticut almost a year, and it ain't as bad as, I mean, unless you touch  the little girl or something, then, you know, you're going to get messed up.  But I had a color TV, a Game Boy, CDs, a CD player, radio listening to you guys every  morning.  That's great.  See?  It wasn't bad at all.  It took 20 minutes, but these are the phone calls we're looking for.  What did you have?  What did you have in the joint? 
[01:03:00]  This guy had everything.  He had more than most of our listeners.  Yeah.  What did you do?  What were you in for?  Possession of deadly weapons.  Oh.  What did you have?  I had a knife in my car.  Oh.  You did a year for a knife in your car, dude?  Come on.  There was something else going on.  Yeah.  What happened?  Unpaid parking tickets?  Not first offense.  A little bit of marijuana.  Yeah.  There you go.  Not your first offense?  Probation and all that good stuff.  Yeah.  And all right.  A kilo of Coke in my car.  Yeah.  And I was already on probation for murder. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  All right, guys.  I love you guys.  You guys are the best.  Hey, what game were you playing?  What game was I playing?  Yeah.  GTA?  Metroid.  You know Metroid?  Oh, Metroid.  Metroid, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's an older game, so you've been out a while, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike.  Keep your nose clean.  Yeah, Mike, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  No, I lived in North Carolina.  I had a buddy, Bob.  And I'll tell you, they have a lot of stuff in jail.  Because he used to get out, you know, once a week. 
[01:04:00]  He'd hang out on the weekends or something, depending on how often he went in.  But he'd go in just to have a place to stay.  Because he'd get kicked out of the house or something.  He's like, yeah, I got no place to stay.  It's cold.  I'll go to jail this week.  Is that Mayberry?  The hell is...  No, I lived towards the Outer Banks, right in the Outer Banks there.  I've heard this before.  Because you don't have a place to sleep.  And you get a nice little bed in jail.  Yeah.  So he'd go out there.  And now, there is...  You know, you got the other side, too. 
[01:04:30]  You got to think about the bad things that happen.  Because I know, personally, a gay guy that murdered someone.  He's been in since the 80s.  And, you know...  Wow.  He has a lot of stuff.  But, you know, at the same time, they have a lot of stuff they have to deal with.  I mean, he's got guys, you know, that try to beat him up.  So then he's got to go, you know...  You know what?  I think after a while, if you're doing a pretty long sentence, you become friends.  Eventually, you just become friends.  You're seeing the guys trying to rape you year after year. 
[01:05:00]  Eventually, it's like, you know what?  Hey, man.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  It's kind of like that old cartoon with, you know, clocking in.  Yeah, where the sheepdog and the wolf, they punch in.  How are you doing, Sam?  All right, pretty good.  And then the guy sits there, and they try to kill each other the whole time.  And then the whistle blows, and they punch out.  I'd imagine you become friends eventually with some of these people.  Because you're like...  But does it get to the point where you're being raped, and you're like, 
[01:05:30]  hey, did you see the game last night?  All right, all right, let's get this over with.  Because you're friends, so you're talking about that.  But, you know, you have some kind of a common bond.  Like, maybe the mess hall is painted.  Do you, like, just notice that together, like, while he's raping you?  Right.  The stupid green mess hall.  And the guy, yeah, this is kind of weird.  They painted it green.  Yeah.  And continue brutalizing it.  Right.  You just notice the subtle changes around you.  Yeah.  It becomes a relationship.  You've got to think you become friends.  I mean, the newbies that come in, I'm sure that's a whole other thing.  But the guys you're doing the time with year after year, eventually it's just like, 
[01:06:00]  all right, I'm done with you.  What are you doing tonight?  Why don't we watch some wrestling tonight and talk about life?  Jamie in Florida.  Yeah.  You did five years for burglary?  Yeah.  How tough was it in the joint?  It wasn't...  If you can get past the first year, it ain't too bad after that.  Yeah.  The first year is the rough one?  Yeah.  Why?  The first year is when you've got to prove yourself. 
[01:06:30]  Hmm.  If you don't prove yourself, then they're going to take that you-know-what.  Well, how'd you prove yourself?  You just got to...  Well, I was pretty much like Anthony.  I was the funny guy.  You're the funny guy.  Comedy gets you out of a lot of trouble.  Being silly can get you out of a lot of messes.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  I imagine if someone's having their way with you in the shower and you're just laughing  through the whole thing.  You're cracking jokes.  I think that's the last time anyone has their way with you in the shower because that's 
[01:07:00]  just creepy.  Especially if you do impressions.  You can just do the creepiest movie voices.  Right.  Oh.  And then if it turns out that he wants to, say, sodomize you in a certain way, you just  hold something like a telephone and go, hello, hello.  I would just have the most psych...  You're in the shower, Jim.  I would have the most psychotic laugh.  And they want you to do something to them.  Okay.  You just...  You grab a certain thing and hold it up to your ear and go, hello, hello. 
[01:07:30]  Hello.  Call for me.  Yeah.  That would get around the gym.  Yeah.  That's funny.  You do a psychotic laugh.  People are going to be like, there's other people to do this to.  You got to just go, turn around and go, is that all you got?  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Hey, Jamie, what did you have in your cell, though?  I didn't have a whole lot of stuff in my cell.  He had a TV. 
[01:08:00]  And, I mean, it's like camp.  I mean...  See, he did five years and he's admitting it was like camp after a while.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not...  Are you talking...  Once you're acclimated, it's not that bad.  I mean, it ain't no more than normal life.  I mean, except you ain't got no bills.  Or women.  You got no bills.  There you go.  Yeah.  Hey, dude, how was your burglary five years?  You must have, like, woke someone up, I guess, huh?  No, actually, it was a neighbor and...  You tied her up.  I got... 
[01:08:30]  All I got out of that was probation because it was my first offense.  Yeah.  But a year later on probation, I went on a high-speed chase with the cops through three counties.  And the judge didn't like that very well.  So I got three years for the burglary and I got two years for running from the cops.  Man, did you make America's wildest police chases or anything like that?  No, I committed my crime in Ohio in a small town, so it wasn't, you know, not...  It was a big headliner there, but it didn't reach no big city, so I mean... 
[01:09:00]  Ah, well, better luck next time.  God, you know what?  We just found our audience because...  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  The phones have never been hotter.  They just love robbing people.  Did three years...  Let me just read these real fast before we go to break.  Did three years for assault after shooting a robber in my house.  A homeless guy always did something to go to jail every winter to stay warm.  I hear they have liquid soap in prison now.  Gays are segregated from general population.  Did seven years for armed robbery.  Guards protected the pedophiles. 
[01:09:30]  Been to jail twice.  Only the willing get raped.  I was in jail.  People raped the pedophile.  This is our audience.  Can we get to some of these guys when we come back?  There's some lovely stories here.  Yeah, we'll get to a few more of these stories.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss joins us next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, people are talking, talking, talking, talking, so...  Yeah.  I got to confirm it.  Yes.  We're doing something at my brother's restaurant for St. Paddy's Day. 
[01:10:00]  It's going to be there.  And don't worry, Tom.  We don't need the help, but I got to get the info out there for the people.  We're doing karaoke St. Paddy's Day.  Yes.  It's a week from this Saturday at FH Riley's.  Most of the gang will be there.  Yes, it is happening.  My brother's restaurant's at 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  FH Riley's.  We'll see you at St. Paddy's Day there. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  It is true.  And they're having their parade this weekend in Huntington.  The gay one?  No, no.  Oh, right.  Yeah, they do the gay parade in Huntington.  I noticed they paint a pink line.  Do they still do that?  They paint a pink line down the street.  It's kind of like lavender.  Yeah, it's like a lavender.  Yeah, I know.  For the gay parade and then a green one for St. Paddy's Day.  But they're going to have St. Paddy's Day and the parade this weekend, so FH Riley's will  be rocking this weekend as well on Sunday during the day.  During the day.  I think I'm going to be there as well on Sunday. 
[01:11:00]  So, Jimmy, you're going to be at FH Riley's a week from Saturday, St. Paddy's Day, karaoke?  I will be in, unfortunately, I'll be in California performing.  What?  Oh.  The Ontario Improv.  It's my first time out there, I think.  All right.  Well, have fun, I guess.  But I'll be singing.  We'll miss you.  I have a closing bit I'm doing now where I kind of like to make funny song lyrics up  for the song lyrics that are popular in a lot of songs.  That sounds great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sort of a little change for you.  Didn't guitar lessons.  You know, I'm tired of my act.  The new Jim Norton. 
[01:11:30]  Looking forward to that.  Rich Voss in studio.  Rich.  Already saying just the stupidest things.  It's mind-boggling.  He just sits down and stupidity pours out.  For now on, new rule with you, you're not allowed to talk until we crack the mic.  Until the mic's on.  Because it's unbelievable every time.  The first thing out of his mouth is usually the gem.  It is just, it really is.  It's gem after gem after gem.  You're just talking about flying over to England because apparently he went over to England. 
[01:12:00]  You're like a Yogi Berra type.  Yeah.  You just say really stupid things all the time.  No, I got...  You're the Yogi Berra for this generation.  Things that you're going to see as stupid.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you say what you said?  I said, well, I said the Voss.  Voss flew to England.  I said, what airline did you fly?  He said, Continental.  I go, well, do they fly you?  I go, do they fly you first or coach?  And I said coach, but I had the emergency row exit where...  This is the best part, by the way.  Now he's going to try to explain why he's like this. 
[01:12:30]  You didn't say it like this.  Yes, say it.  I said, the emergency row exit is almost as good as...  No, no, no, no.  See, you're a liar.  You're lying.  You said...  Yes.  Because we know what you said.  You said the emergency row is just as good.  He goes, that's exactly how he said it, too.  Don't try to go, well, you know, I said, so they fly you first.  He goes, well, I had the emergency row, which is just as good.  Just as good.  Just as good.  And the only reason you got called out on it is I said, no, it's not.  Because the emergency row in coach is not just as good as first class transatlantic. 
[01:13:00]  That's like a sleeper bed they give you and a waitress comes  out and gives you food, anything you want, the little press of a button.  You've got a drink and a real glass, real silverware.  Fresh baked cookies.  Yeah, cookies.  They're bringing out like ice cream sundaes for you.  Yeah, you get a little more leg room in the emergency row.  Because we had the front seat.  There's nothing in front of you.  So it's just as good.  Of course, it's just as good.  You know what?  They should have charged you first class prices for that. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  They only charged coach prices for that seat.  I'm waiting for him to say, look, the curtain was right in front of me.  It's just as good.  I was that close.  I'm only three feet away from all that luxury.  I'm under the curtain.  Look, I fight first class all the time.  It doesn't matter.  I'm going to sleep on the plane.  Yeah.  Do you sleep better in first class?  I can't do that.  What?  Sleep?  Sleep on a plane.  Just the worst travel companion ever.  I've traveled with this ass.  And all it is is you go to say something and you see his head and he's like.  Like Kenny. 
[01:14:00]  Do you want to smother him?  The worst travel companion.  All right.  We don't want to lose these people.  They've been on hold for a long time.  Greg on Long Island.  What's up?  You're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's up, fellas?  How's it going?  I'm pretty good, man.  I don't know too much about it, but when I was in Arizona last year, I was visiting  my cousin and he did a stretch in a place called Tent City.  Oh, I heard about this place.  Tent City rules.  Where the warden makes you, no matter what crime you do, you're out in the heat 365 days  a year wearing pink pajamas and pink slippers just to make an example out of you.  But you're on your tents, right? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  You're on the tents, but it doesn't matter.  You're like in the middle of the summer, it could be 120 degrees out there, but they  don't care.  You're stuck outside all day no matter what the temperature is, wearing pink pajamas just  to make an example out of you.  Boy, that's that particular penal system?  Like that's the jail?  Tent City?  Yeah, that's what it's called.  Tent City.  And you drive by and there's just tents set up all around the place.  Like I said, I don't know too much about it.  I didn't get a chance to visit it while I was visiting there.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  I hear about the pink outfits, whatever you want to call them, uniforms, prison uniforms. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Is it really a big deal if everyone's wearing pink?  It becomes the thing.  It's like regular jails here where everybody's wearing blue.  I guess you get stuck, you know, you get used to wearing that.  But I'm just saying it's much more effective if you just have just a few of the guys in  pink.  Then it becomes like, ha, ha, ha, pink.  Then it's a joke.  But if you're all wearing pink, what's the big deal at that point?  That's true.  That's how you can't run.  Yeah.  It's better to make an example out of somebody who did something worse by sticking them  in a pink outfit as opposed to everybody wearing it. 
[01:15:30]  I'm in Tent City.  You're outdoors all day, even though it's hot.  Yeah, outside all day.  That's what I was told.  That you're just, you're stuck outside no matter what the temperature is.  You're under tents all day long.  They set up cops for you and you sleep outside.  Do they have any air conditioning or no?  No, not that I know of, no.  Yeah.  You're just stuck out there and that's it.  That sounds a lot worse than Rikers.  I got to be honest with you.  Yeah, just because, I mean, especially in the summertime, who wants to be stuck out there  in 120 degree weather just sweating?  It's awful, dude.  There's nothing to do about it. 
[01:16:00]  I would take the outdoors over the inside, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I think I'd have to agree with that.  Especially in a tent, you feel like you're camping, having some fun, you laugh.  Yeah, but the outdoors, you see people living right outside of you, you know, driving by  and living.  My cousin did a couple years in Arizona in prison and he's as goofy a Jew as anybody could  be and he told me that, you know, a skinhead or Arian walked into a cell and, you know,  punched him in the face and then the guy's walking down the tier and my cousin ran up 
[01:16:30]  from behind him and kicked him and punched him in the back of the head or whatever and  they didn't mess with him the rest of the time he was in prison.  Because he fought back.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to prove yourself a little bit.  Let's say hi to Justin in Boston.  Justin, what's up?  Justin.  Hey.  All right, we're moving way too fast.  We can't wait around today.  Roger, Michigan, what's going on?  Good morning, fellas.  Hey.  Yeah, you're on.  Jesus.  Good morning.  Hey.  You don't take orders very well.  Good morning, Roger.  How are you today? 
[01:17:00]  Get the pleasantries over with him.  Just get to the story.  We don't do pleasantries on this show.  Waste too much time.  We're only on the air like three hours on this side.  We got to get right into stuff.  Let's go, Roger.  I did 10 years in prison and it's nothing like these guys at Cogwell.  I don't know where they did time in prison, but I did almost two years in a whole  just because of the fighting that I did throughout all the time I was in there.  All we had was black and white TVs, pedophiles.  They didn't get messed with any longer because they were rats and they were the guards' little  little puppets. 
[01:17:30]  So they didn't have no problem.  What did you do your time?  I did my time in Michigan, all of it.  10 years for what?  I used to rob places.  I used to rob places.  Is that on your resume?  Yeah.  I'm beating around a bush.  I dabbled in a little robbery.  Yeah.  What do you do now?  Well, actually, I work for construction.  Okay.  So you're on the straight and narrow, huh?  Yeah, it's have to be.  I have a family.  What's the worst part of being in jail?  What do you miss the most when you're in jail? 
[01:18:00]  Women.  It is.  Okay.  That's it.  That's it.  That would be top of the charts, obviously.  What's the second thing you miss?  Uh, normal food.  Just normal food?  As a white guy.  And so you sound like a white guy.  Were you in the Aryan Brotherhood or any gangs there?  No, I wasn't.  I'm actually a Native American, so I was pretty isolated from a lot of people, and that's why  I did get in so many fights, because I have long hair, and so I was a pretty guy to the  black guys, but I wasn't backing down to anybody, so. 
[01:18:30]  Well, like, say, like, okay, so you got Aryan Brotherhood Muslims and all that.  Say, like, uh, just a Jew goes into prison.  Who, what does he, who does he have?  Just say he owns it.  You know, I mean, there's certain people, like, what happens, like, when something like  that happens?  Say, like, I, I, yeah, another great question from Rich Vox.  Rich, let's go to, it's like a child's question.  Yeah, really.  If the man was yelling at me, would he beat me up if I said don't?  No, that's a great question.  Well, first of all, I think statistically, the amount of Jews in prison are zero, and 
[01:19:00]  I think it's like a white-collar crime.  They go to those country club places, and they're out in, like, two months.  Yeah.  It's no Jews in prison.  All right, let's go to, uh, Alan Westbury.  Al.  Proven.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  Uh, the reason that Joe Arpaio out in Tent City makes those prisoners wear pink is because  what he realized, like, when the guys get released from jail, they take with them, like, their  blue denim and dungaree outfits, and it gives them, like, street cred out there.  Like, I'm a big badass. 
[01:19:30]  I just got out of jail.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So he figured that if I dress him in pink, no guy in their right mind is going to walk  around with pink pants out there.  All right.  I had no idea you could take that stuff home with you.  I think you had to bring it back.  You would look like a badass on the streets.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, here's a criminal justice, uh, major wants to explain Tent City.  It's Wes in Connecticut.  Wes.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Hey, um, my professor told, I guess, worked on the case.  He was telling me that the inmates of Tent City actually tried to sue the state of Arizona 
[01:20:00]  and their corrections board because they said the pink was cruel and inhumane.  And, uh, the courts ruled that, hey, tough luck, man.  You guys are going to sit out there and you're going to wear pink and you're going to like  it.  Yeah.  How could they say it's cruel?  What do they do in Tent City?  They just lounge around?  Do they have to, like, do details?  I think they work.  I think it's like a work, uh, thing.  Like a chain gang.  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty much as close to a chain gang as they can get in this day and age.  I don't know.  They have, like, working parties and then it's just like, it's like basically old canvas 
[01:20:30]  army tents with bunk beds in them and that's what they sleep in.  Oh, wow.  Hey, boy.  You get out there, boy.  That's what you need in one of those good old time with the guys standing around with  the shotgun and the sunglasses.  The Ray-Bans.  The big wad of chew in his mouth.  Like the ugly one from, uh, from Scarecrow who raped Al Pacino.  I think that was the one.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Tristan.  Tristan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Uh, yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Uh, these guys that are, especially that Penn City, you know, these, these, uh, prisons  are like, uh, like golf courses or something.  I did 10 years in a real prison called Attica.  Oh, little place named Attica.  Little place called Attica.  Did you play the big room, sir?  What'd you do?  Yeah, what'd you do there?  Uh, well, oh, at the prison or what'd I do to get there?  No, what'd you do to make Attica?  Well, I, uh, I took a bottle, a broken bottle to my girlfriend's, uh, husband. 
[01:21:30]  So, in a bar down in Boston.  And, uh, what happened to the, the guy?  Uh, he's talking through an electric, uh, voice box.  Sounds like that, uh, way off of South Park.  Mmm, blimey.  Oh, wow, you cut out his voice box?  Why'd you do that?  Uh, he beat the shit out of my, uh, sister with a baseball bat.  I figured, what the hell.  All right, wait a minute.  You just cursed.  So, this guy beat the crap out of your sister with a baseball bat?  Yeah.  So, you decided to take a bottle to his neck, basically? 
[01:22:00]  It didn't really, uh, it just eventually went that far.  Yeah.  I didn't think, yeah, I'm gonna go stab this guy, but, uh, it got bad, and, uh, that's  the first thing, you know, I just ended up, the bottle ended up breaking, so I just picked  it up.  Note to self.  That's pretty good, guy.  Hold on, hold on.  Note to self.  Mm-hmm.  No more public appearances for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  All right.  My listeners are scaring me.  No kidding, man.  Did people know what you did in jail?  Yeah, people do know. 
[01:22:30]  So, like, uh, the one guy said, the first year's the toughest, you definitely gotta prove  yourself, but, uh, if you think about it, with a name like Tristan, I've kind of had  to prove myself my whole life.  It's kind of a femmy name.  Yeah, you got a little femmy name.  Yeah.  Yeah, I kind of, I kind of do, I'll admit that, and that's not my mom's fault.  But, uh, my whole life, I took kickboxing just to, just to back my name up, so, you definitely  gotta prove yourself, and in Attica, there's a couple of spots where they keep kind of  like, uh, underground fights, you know?  So, so, it helps out, if you at least win a couple of fights, you'll probably get, get 
[01:23:00]  the crap kicked out of you.  Prison Fight Club?  Wait, it's like Prison Fight Club?  It's kind of like Fight Club, but the prison guards, they know what's going on, and it's,  and, uh, the protophiles, eh, they, they're definitely not rats up there.  Nobody, nobody, I, I was there for nine years, and I'll tell you what, I might have seen two  or three people get raped the whole time.  You know, people do not like gay people in there, they do not like pedophiles, rapists. 
[01:23:30]  I'm a little disappointed with the prison, uh, rape stats that we're hearing from the  actual convicts.  Yeah, I've always heard it's less than you think.  Yeah.  It is definitely less than you think.  You're disappointing.  What do you do now, Tristan?  I actually own a landscaping business.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  What do you use to cut the grass, a bottle?  Are you allowed to talk if you're white?  Are you allowed to hang out or talk at all to the black convicts if you're white?  You do realize you're a guest on the show, not a host.  I'm just saying.  I like a simple little question. 
[01:24:00]  I love Voss's, Voss has a, he's childlike questions.  He is childlike.  Would I talk to the black people if I was there?  Is it a bad place?  Hold on, sir.  My nephew wants to know, uh, if he'd be allowed to talk to the black, my nephew.  It's bring your nephew to work day.  Uh, he has a question for you, sir.  Just humor him.  Isn't that a normal question?  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, no, not for a man in his forties.  Could you have a puppy in prison? 
[01:24:30]  You guys.  When are you going to be on, are you smarter than a fifth grader, by the way?  Have they called you yet?  I'm playing the fifth grader.  That was the joke, though.  Oh, no, you're a contestant.  Oh, Richard.  Holy crap.  Definitely a lot to talk to people.  So, wait, now, Voss had a very valid question.  Are you allowed to talk to black people there?  That's another thing that's really misconstrued.  Everybody in the big-time prisons, you know, they all help each other out.  I mean, initially, they definitely hate each other. 
[01:25:00]  Like, the Aryans, they definitely hate the black people.  But, you know, Aryans got stuff that black people want.  Black people got stuff the Aryans want.  Yeah, there's commerce going on.  You know, it's just like the world.  Japanese and Americans, they got stuff we want.  We got stuff they want.  We'll still bomb the crap out of them if we ever want to.  Did you join the Aryans?  You know what?  I didn't join them, but they definitely did back me up because I made a couple of them a lot of money in a couple of those fights.  So, if I ever needed help with, like, a black guy, I beat a black guy up really bad. 
[01:25:30]  And a couple of his buddies wanted to come after me.  And, you know, I didn't even have to ask them for help.  They said I made them about $500, $600.  That's nice.  There's Aryans.  Sweet people.  All right, we're going to take one more.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Tristan.  You're cool, right?  Don't want to hang up on any of these guys.  You're all right?  Yeah, you're all right.  Yo, why aren't you just hanging up on me?  Oh, hell yeah, right.  These guys are getting the most courteous.  All right, thanks for calling.  Godspeed.  Anything else you want to say?  Shock Jock's head removed with a weed whacker. 
[01:26:00]  I'm not stupid.  You got to know your place, man.  We all know our place in this world.  You yell and scream at the mom, the soccer mom in her minivan if she cuts you off.  But if it's some kind of, you know, gang member, you're not even honking or doing anything.  Look down.  Lock your doors.  That is the reality.  We all know our place out there.  What?  Just flip a couple gang sides.  You'll eventually get it right.  They're all messed up.  All right.  Thank you, Tristan.  Best caller of the day.  Yeah.  Chip in Kentucky. 
[01:26:30]  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  Hi, Chip.  All right.  You did 24 months for manslaughter.  Yeah.  I shot a guy six times in the face with his own pistol.  Well, I'm going to take a different approach.  So how did you find out about the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, I'm on my own truck now.  And of course, I have XM.  So I've been listening to you guys for about, oh, probably since you came on XM about two,  two and a half years ago. 
[01:27:00]  Cool.  So some guy was probably menacing you with a weapon.  You took his gun from him and shot him and they considered it a little excessive.  Well, he was actually harassing me.  I used to be a DJ, guys.  I was in a small little town in Kentucky, did radio and sportscasting.  And I was actually messing around with the guy's girlfriend.  Okay.  And he came up to me at work one evening and approached me with, you know, pistol in hand. 
[01:27:30]  And initially, I ran from him.  And, you know, I'm a decent-sized guy, though.  So it was like I finally got fed up running.  I actually got tired.  And he chased me down an alley.  And when he turned the corner, I tripped him.  He dropped his gun.  And I picked it up and shot him six times. 
[01:28:00]  So you not only had sex with his girlfriend, you killed him by shooting him in the face.  Shot him in the face.  Did you get back in time to seg the record?  Yeah.  Hope you were playing a long Zeppelin tune or something.  People had two years of pump up the jam.  Well, actually, my last time on air was 87.  That was my last sign-on period.  Yeah.  But the reason why I got only 12, or excuse me, I got 24 months and then in prison. 
[01:28:30]  And then I had to do three years probation.  And I wasn't allowed to return to the small town in Kentucky until my probation was up.  Ladies and gentlemen, the live version of Greengrass and High Tides.  I'm going to be away for a while.  But I told them that I had blanked out.  Yeah.  You know, that I didn't remember what exactly happened, which was, you know, Bravo Sierra. 
[01:29:00]  But two years for manslaughter.  And I got a good lawyer.  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying on Instant Feedback, this is a true shock jock that we're talking to right now, man.  That is shocking.  Doesn't get much more shocking than this.  Womp womp.  All right, Chip, and you had all the luxuries in jail?  I spent my time in Eddyville, which is the federal training country. 
[01:29:30]  It's also where they have the, where they actually do the executions in Kentucky.  And it's a pretty run-down, dilapidated, you know, piece of crap.  Black and white TVs.  If you could get any reception, it's out almost on an island in the middle of a lake.  Were you beaten up in jail at all?  They tried, I was jumped by a couple of blacks, but I was able to get my revenge. 
[01:30:00]  Okay.  Were you able to talk to them?  We're in the brotherhood.  We'll put it that way.  Rich, you got a question for Chip?  Not right now, because, you know, it's just, well, yeah, I got a question, because the  last caller, they said you got to prove yourself, but the last caller said he beat this guy up  too bad, then his friends came after him.  So do you have to prove yourself but draw a line as you're proving yourself? 
[01:30:30]  You know what I mean?  How bad can you beat a guy before they come after you?  Well, you, in prison, you can offend anyone with, you know, you could accidentally bump  into somebody, and you've offended them and their entire clique, gang, whatever you want  to call it, and you're going to get beat down.  So, you know, I was a fresh fish.  I think I was in for a month when I took a very good beating. 
[01:31:00]  I spent two weeks in the infirmary.  What did you do?  Like, what happened?  Why did you take a beating?  Well, I offended a couple of black guys.  On purpose?  Well, they were actually local in my area, and they knew that I really didn't, the area  of Kentucky where I'm from, I'm just going to let you know that it's extremely white. 
[01:31:30]  Utopia, Connecticut, right?  Kentucky.  There used to be a sign in town that said, don't let the sun sit on your black ass.  Oh, one of those.  One of those.  When they found out that I was from there, that just, you know.  Okay, all right.  Chip, I don't want to be rude, but we do have to move on.  Yeah, we've got to move on now.  Any final thoughts?  Thank you.  That's been great.  You guys hit. 
[01:32:00]  And then what happened?  You guys are great.  Yeah, right.  All right, Chip.  I'm not playing that game.  I understand.  And I'm not even going to test it.  He does listen a lot.  I'm not stupid.  Thank you, Mr. Chip.  Thanks, guys.  We like Chip.  How can you not?  He's a good guy.  Isn't everything delicious?  Do we continue with this?  We got, I was sexually harassed in jail.  You have to.  Lisa from Arizona did a year in Tent City.  Like an episode of Oz.  And Richard from Jersey, I'm gay, did seven years.  We aren't segregated.  Must be like being sentenced to a strip club when you go to prison and you're gay. 
[01:32:30]  All right, hey, we'll continue with that.  Also, South Park hit it out of the park last night.  Out of the park.  They are anything but PC over there.  They did a whole show on the N-word.  The whole show.  Just laugh out loud funny.  We got some clips in case you missed it.  But search out this episode.  Do yourself a favor. 
[01:33:00]  One of the funniest things in a long time.  But we'll get into that as well.  Oh, it's on YouTube?  Perfect, yeah.  Search it out on YouTube.  Sure, they love that.  They do love YouTube.  Do they really?  Yeah, they don't have a problem with YouTube.  I think Matt and Trey have no problem.  But I think Comedy Central's got a problem.  Because they were pulling off clips from the Colbert Report.  Right.  And the Daily Show.  Things like that.  Well, they understand that it gets their material out there.  They have no problem with that.  They don't care.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.

We had an interesting thing for us that he did in England.  I just wanted to get to it real quick.  I didn't want to lose the momentum on that.  Because he was telling us.  And I said, uh...  Rich, what were you saying?  Wait.  Well, he's breaking the rules.  We told you, don't talk unless the mic's on. 
[01:34:00]  Only when the mic's on, Rich.  You're not allowed to talk.  I know we're all friends off the air.  But when you're here, you are the resident dummy.  No.  Uncertainty.  Well, whatever.  I said, I went to the Sherlock Holmes Museum.  Right?  Why are you laughing at me?  The what?  You went where?  In England.  In England.  The Sherlock Holmes Museum.  Right.  So we get there.  That's funny on so many levels. 
[01:34:30]  He said the resident dummy, and you said on some things, what aren't you on?  Oh, my God.  What are you an expert on?  You know a lot of things.  All right.  So you went to the Sherlock Holmes Museum.  Yeah.  So we're walking up in it, and I'm looking around.  Wait, wait.  You went where?  I want to make sure the listeners understand this.  Because it's not a real person.  I know.  That's what I screwed up at the place, at the Sherlock Holmes Museum.  All right.  I said to the guy, there was like a guy there, I said, is this the original furniture?  Like, I thought we were really in his house, because it was in a house. 
[01:35:00]  In whose house?  In Sherlock Holmes.  You thought it was his homes?  Listen.  And then-  You were in Sherlock Holmes' home.  Yeah.  So then I said, is this the original furniture?  Home Holmes.  And he said, no, it's all, you know, replica or whatever.  And Bonnie said-  Hey, idiot.  He was a fictional character.  So basically, the museum made no sense.  You know what I mean?  Much like Rich Voss.  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
[01:35:30]  Yes, on every level.  Why don't we go there?  What else?  And then we-  Why'd you go where?  Sherlock Holmes Museum.  What's so funny is-  Can somebody-  Is there anyone on the phone who might know?  I don't know.  Has anyone called in about it?  I'm just curious.  No, they're listening to Eric and Kathy.  They moved on from this show.  Of course.  And then during the break, you're showing us a picture of something.  A blob or something.  No, the ultrasound from the baby. 
[01:36:00]  No one cares.  I know.  I do.  I'm happy that you're going to be a father at 55 years old and all that.  Yeah.  But this happens to all of us.  Like, that's the new thing is to show off the picture of the ultrasound.  Ultrasound.  I can't even tell you what I'm looking at.  I didn't know what I was looking at.  I'm happy that you're going to be a father.  I know you and Bonnie are very excited.  All that.  I'm with you.  But when you start showing pictures of blobs, I don't know what to say.  No idea.  That's a good point.  You showed Anthony, and it's like, I don't even know what I'm looking at.  I said he was cute.  You said you're holding it upside down. 
[01:36:30]  How old is the baby now?  Can I see the picture?  Five months.  No.  I swear.  There's no reason.  I won't rip it up.  I don't care.  That's too personal.  I understand.  No, what I said here.  But I got to see the blob again.  It's hard to tell.  But what I was saying to Anthony, I have five.  But why would you show people this?  Why do any?  Why does it?  Well, because the whole idea of this is, I don't even care if you rip it up.  I'm not going to rip it up.  I swear.  I have five pictures of my unborn baby, which is more pictures than my family has of me 
[01:37:00]  alive.  All right.  Now, that's funny.  That's why I was showing it.  All right.  I don't know what I'm looking at.  Is this teeth?  Is that teeth?  No, that's a spine.  This is a spine.  Okay.  You don't know how big the picture is?  Like, what's the scale?  Is it you're just looking at a face?  Are you looking at the whole kid's body, just a toe?  I could point it out.  It looks like the kid is smoking in the womb.  That's right.  Smoking hot.  All right.  What is this?  What is that?  Well, it's too far.  Oh, that's the baby curled over.  That's the back of the head.  Can't you see?  No.  I swear to God, it cannot.  Cannot make it. 
[01:37:30]  Look, I'm happy for you, but I don't know.  That baby has.  People hand these pictures, you know, to you all the time out there.  And you're like, all right.  That baby in the womb has better posture than Norton does.  And he's smarter than you.  Sherlock Holmes Museum.  Sherlock Holmes Museum, huh?  The kid in the picture just laughs at you.  I see his little hand, though.  And that's his little knee, right?  The little knee bone.  It's cute.  All right.  Let's see.  You actually can see.  Give me that guy.  Yeah, that's the hand.  That's the knee.  Get out of here. 
[01:38:00]  One of the pictures, you can almost see something.  The rest are just blobs.  And that's the head.  And that's his back.  And those are his legs, right?  Yeah.  Those are his little hands like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a girl.  Is it?  Yeah.  I almost said, how do they know?  And then I caught myself.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's take the call.  Let's go to Drew in Queens.  Drew, what's up?  Hi, Drew.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Is this idiot saying Sherlock Holmes?  Yeah.  What?  What is he, retarded?  Yes.  Oh, Holmes.  What's the big deal?  The big deal?  The big deal.  Sherlock Holmes.  There's an S, stupid. 
[01:38:30]  Whatever.  Oh, let's go to Craig in Jersey.  Craig, what's up?  Oh, Rich Ross.  What up, Holmes?  Home.  What up, Holmes?  You're a half a retard.  You ain't even a retard.  You're half a re.  Half a re.  Those teeth.  The kid already has false teeth to fall onto the counter.  Just reading his feedback.  Sorry.  Let's say hi to Jocelyn.  She's a girl from Jersey, of course.  What's up, Jocelyn?  Where did Jocelyn go? 
[01:39:00]  Are you there?  Oh, my God.  She hung up.  It was the best call of the day.  What?  She spent time in the joint and wanted to talk about all the lesbianism that was going on.  Oh, no.  I bet it was big, ugly, dykey, lesbian stuff.  And we lost her.  Lisa in Arizona, what's up?  Make you feel better.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  I want to tell you about Tent City, the most disgusting place in the world.  It costs more to feed a dog in the pound than it does to feed a prisoner in Tent City.  Wow.  They give you, it's gross. 
[01:39:30]  They give you, like, the old bread that sits in a grocery store gets taken to Tent City.  So it's moldy bread, green bologna, and then every night they give you, like, cabbage.  And you have to be afraid to drink the Kool-Aid because the guys that work in the kitchen could have hepatitis.  Now, how do you know all this?  Uh, I was there.  Oh, what'd you do?  Uh, we went to Boozen and Cruzen.  Boozen and Cruzen, a dewey?  Yeah, I got quite a few of them, actually.  Yeah, I was going to say, it's not your first dewey if they sing it at Tent City. 
[01:40:00]  Nope, they sent me to the big bad place.  How many deweys?  Huh?  How many deweys do you have?  Be honest.  Uh, four.  Oh, God.  Four?  What's wrong with you?  You can't drink and drive.  I almost understand two.  Almost.  After that.  You must really be bad.  I could see my house.  I could see my house.  They all say that.  It was on your windshield.  You know, it's like when you're playing tag as a kid, you get to go home base.  Yeah.  You know, they should let you do that.  When you're pretty much in your driveway, they should let you. 
[01:40:30]  You made it there.  You didn't kill anyone.  They should let you get away with it.  Hey.  Gosh, you made it home.  Let her inside.  We talk all the time.  Drunk driving used to be a sport back in the day.  I know.  It's not fair.  Remember the days the cops would, like, pull you over, realize you're drunk with your  buddies and go, all right, I'm taking your keys.  There's a diner nearby.  I'll be back at the end of my shift to give you your key back.  That type of thing used to happen.  Yeah, all that stuff.  You must be really a bad drunk, though.  You're probably one of those that really weaves a lot and talks back to the cops. 
[01:41:00]  I think it's more driving drunk and angry that does it.  Yeah.  If you're angry or you're, like, listening to your stereo, singing to a song.  Wait, wait.  How do you drive drunk angry?  Are you just knocking down, like, mailboxes?  Driving to a perfect yard.  Driving too fast.  Just pissed off.  You know when you're pissed off.  I know you know.  You got that fast car.  Yeah, but let me tell you something.  If I've been drinking and I have to drive somewhere, unless it's 4th of July of last  year, I usually make sure I do the speed limit. 
[01:41:30]  I don't care if it takes me forever to get to wherever I'm going.  I use my blinkers.  I'm, like, really kind of safe.  I set the cruise control so I'm not, like, my speed isn't changing a lot and I can  concentrate just on staying in the lane.  Things like that.  There's a way to drive drunk.  Yeah.  You don't know it.  Well, see, they say for every time you've driven drunk, every time you've driven drunk,  you get caught.  You've driven drunk a thousand times.  Ooh.  Wow.  That math might be a little off.  That's a little off.  That means you drive drunk drive every night for over three years. 
[01:42:00]  Pretty much.  It probably has.  That means you drive drunk to Starbucks to get your morning coffee.  Oh, coffee.  Wow.  You drink coffee.  I drink Gatorade and vodka.  You're great.  Gatorade and vodka.  Nice.  Hey, did you get my check I sent you last month?  Jesus.  That tent city's disgusting.  It's the worst place.  It's 120 degrees.  You get all these girls in a tent and girls stink.  Girls are the stinkiest creatures on earth and very few of them would shower. 
[01:42:30]  How many girls in a tent?  40.  You get any action or what?  No, no.  They were the nastiest girls.  I did make some friends.  All my friends were guys until I went to jail.  I did meet a lot of friends.  They were all pretty much drunk drivers that I was in there with, bad check riders, shoplifters.  I wasn't in there with them.  Yeah, chicks in prison are always in it for that.  You get the occasional one that killed the husband or something, but for the most part,  it's bad checks and DEWEs, things like that, welfare scams. 
[01:43:00]  When I was in the holding cell, there was this chick that robbed a bank and then they go  to different parts.  There's like an indoor building and another side of the tents where the real bad girls  go.  So, yeah.  So, were there girls that had kind of girlfriends in there?  Yeah, there were.  There were.  And the one that was there was, she was kind of a guy, you know.  Her name was Michael and she had short hair and she kind of looked like a guy too.  Was there any air conditioning at all or fans?  Air conditioning.  They're outside. 
[01:43:30]  No, in the tent.  Oh, oh.  I'm sorry.  Any what?  Air conditioning?  No, there's a big fan, like a huge fan at each side of the tent that blows.  Get this.  On one side, there's like a garbage dump.  On the other side, there's an animal crematory and then there's a water treatment plant.  So, no matter which way the wind blows, you get the most ranted smell you could possibly  have.  Wow, they really placed this.  Not to mention the nasty girls in the tent already.  And you got snakes crawling in there because you're in Arizona, right?  Scorpions.  Scorpions.  I'm sure the people that work at those other three stinky facilities are complaining about 
[01:44:00]  the stinky women fumes that are coming off of the prison.  Yeah, it's worse outside in 120 degrees.  Lisa, a lot of people are picking up on something.  Did you learn your lesson?  It sounds like you still drink and drive.  Definitely.  I still don't drive.  Oh, you don't?  I still don't drive.  No.  I could have my license back, but I still don't drive.  I have a car that sits there, and if I drink, I do it at home.  It's amazing she won't quit drinking.  It's just a glass of red wine here and there.  I don't booze it out anymore.  What an algae.  She gave up driving.  Yeah, so you can drink. 
[01:44:30]  No.  I just, I live in Florida now.  That's dedication.  Every time I get the money saved up, something crappy happens like a hurricane.  So, I guess God doesn't want me to drive, which is fine.  Hurricane's a good drink.  We have those down in the water.  Do you know how many homes get ruined a year?  How many homes get ruined a year in hurricanes?  How many homes?  How many homes?  How many homes?  Yeah, it's a really gross place.  I just wanted to let you guys know it's not that nice of a place.  And the pink underwear, that's the guys.  It's because the guys were taking them out and giving them to their girlfriends, boxers 
[01:45:00]  and stuff.  Girls were wearing, at the time, girls were wearing boxers.  And he actually sells.  Sheriff Joe makes money so many different ways there.  He'll sell on the outside pink underwear that says Sheriff Joe.  Yeah, he's walking his wear.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Have a great day, guys.  Yeah, you too.  Let's see how the one guy, the one prison you're bored with, the one, the first one that  you give a little crap to.  Yeah.  The chick who didn't do anything violent.  No hit, Herlock. 
[01:45:30]  I know she can't even drive to find me.  So, yeah.  She's pretty much stuck at home.  I'm brave now.  So, Todd in Boston, what's up?  Opie, you read Todd.  Yeah, you read Todd.  First thing you notice about Voss is unborn babies, it's teeth.  Babies don't have, unborn babies don't have teeth.  Well, Rich, I mean, Todd, I was going for a teeth joke because Rich has huge choppers.  Larry literal.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Yeah, help me out a little bit. 
[01:46:00]  Come on, help me out here, Hendry.  If you look at this thing, all you see is teeth, but Voss is telling me it's a spine.  Who knows?  It's his spine.  Yeah, no.  I can't tell spine from teeth.  Keep showing that thing.  Frank.  Bye.  Let's go to Frank in Jersey.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Hey, Rich, I love your comedy, but nobody ever wants to see an ultrasound.  When I had a kid.  No, no, no.  Everybody in my office.  See, we saw Bonnie.  We see that she's pregnant. 
[01:46:30]  That's all we need to know is your friends.  And I'll tussle the little kid when he's born.  I'll have a little fun tussling his hair.  But the ultrasound pictures stink.  Do you guys not get it?  The idea of showing the ultrasound pictures was to say, to show that there's more pictures  of that of my unborn baby than me alive.  I was talking about that.  No, that's kind of your excuse.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Boss, you're constantly looking for approval from your friends.  I've noticed that for a long time.  You come in with your really nice, like, you know, handbag and stuff. 
[01:47:00]  Louis Vuitton bag.  You're like showing off and you're looking for approval.  No, I'm not.  Ultrasound pictures stink.  I mean, most people don't even want to look at pictures of your kid.  So why would they want to see the kid before it's even born?  Rich, when I was in my office and people said, when my wife was pregnant, they said, oh, Frank,  don't you have a picture of the ultrasound?  I said, no.  I said, I want to punch everybody who shows me an ultrasound.  And I would never, ever want to do that.  I have too much respect and love for my fellow man. 
[01:47:30]  Like, first of all, what reaction are we supposed to have?  First of all, oh, wow.  You know what?  No, I'm being serious.  Okay, because you're so close-minded.  Here's the thing.  It's unbelievable that you could take a picture of a baby through a woman's stomach and see  inside the baby.  Oh, is that how they go in?  No, they just rub it on top with the thing.  And that's the amazing part.  I don't know who cares about the picture.  I like the technical jargon.  I think you had a glove and an eight-megapixel elf. 
[01:48:00]  Rich, I agree on the technological aspect of how wonderful it is.  But you take a thousand ultrasounds, and none of them look any different from each other.  Right.  So who cares?  There's no distinguishing, like, wow, look, it looks like Rich or it looks like Bonnie.  It's a blob.  Yeah, exactly.  Your kid is a blob right now.  How many months along is she?  Fine.  Rich, I have to take my hat off to you.  I remember seeing you on Last Comic Standing.  Yeah.  And when they did the contest of writing a pilot, you came up with the funniest, most hysterical 
[01:48:30]  idea, and it was the biggest panned idea ever.  And I'm thinking, these people have no idea what great humor was.  What was it again?  I don't remember.  It was the thing about, he wanted to write a sitcom about a bunch of real idiotic terrorists.  Like, the one guy who called up and made the threats was a stutterer.  The guy with the explosives was horrible, and he had, like, fingers missing.  It was an absolutely hysterical idea.  That was Dave Mordell's pilot.  It wasn't even yours?  That was the other guy. 
[01:49:00]  That was the other guy's pilot.  Wait, was it yours or no?  No, that was Dave Mordell's pilot.  It really wasn't Dave.  I thought that was yours.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  I thought you were finally getting a compliment.  I know.  I was even more depressed now.  Well, I still like your stand-up.  All right.  It's still great.  Thank you, Frank.  Take care, guys.  Frank, are you in prison?  No, no.  All right, get lost.  Are you in prison?  All right, let's say hi to Jocelyn.  She's back.  Lost.  Jocelyn.  Yes, hey.  Hi.  How are you?  Good morning. 
[01:49:30]  You were in prison for what?  No, I was in county jail for six months in Elizabeth.  What did you do?  What did you do?  Drug possession.  All right.  Nice.  What drugs?  Coke and heroin.  Yeah.  Coke and heroin?  And now, how much did you have on you?  Oh, I had a lot.  I had 20 bags of heroin and a couple clips.  So you got intent to sell or something?  Yeah, and I was in a school zone.  It was me and my friend at the time.  In a school zone?  She was naked, having sex with a student, and she... 
[01:50:00]  How many other things can you throw into this?  Wow.  Why were you in a school zone?  That's where you sell the drugs.  No, I understand that, but I don't think that's why she was there.  I think it's something stupid.  Why were you in the school zone?  Well, the whole town of Elizabeth is in a school zone.  They do it like that to get you in trouble.  Ah.  They cut it out like that.  But I was only 18, and I grew up in a small town in Old Bridge.  So I was in for a big shock when I went there.  This is getting hot now.  18, sent to prison.  Yes, and actually, I heard all these horror stories. 
[01:50:30]  I thought it was going to be really bad.  But the women, what they do is they wife each other, and there's just a lot of lesbian activity  that goes around.  They make socks out of socks and soap, like dildos and stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  And it's not bad.  The only fighting, really, is if you get with somebody else's wife.  Yeah.  All right.  So did you have all these girls, like, coming on to you when you were in the joint for six 
[01:51:00]  months?  Yes, because I'm white.  I had real hair and all my teeth.  So, you know.  That's all they're looking for?  They're looking for white, all your hair, and all your teeth?  Yeah.  Because some of them are pretty scary.  I'm like me in junior high.  That's all I was looking for.  What?  Some of them were really scary in there.  They really looked like men.  And they'd walk around with, like, socks in their pants to pretend like they had something.  Were they really?  Oh, wow.  I'd do the same thing.  Wow.  And, but also, too, the correction officers. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  And I hooked up with the correction officer when I was in there.  How hot is that?  Backing up to the bars, were you?  Yeah.  How'd you get it done?  He worked in medical, so he would just call me down for, you know, say there was a medical  appointment.  Ah, time for your enema.  You know, and.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is, you know, we can't just blow this off.  So, you're in the joint, and you decide you like this guy? 
[01:52:00]  Well, I mean, you gotta do what you gotta do, you know?  I mean, he had access to cigarettes and McDonald's, so.  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah.  Cigarettes and McDonald's.  That's worth your dignity.  Sure, of course.  At least you went for the rainbow.  Oh, mighty.  You traded in your.  You want to do the next live read for McDonald's for us?  Because, look, I don't sell my body.  I've got Triscuits.  All right.  Teen body.  So, you give him.  Cigarettes and McDonald's.  Do you give him the look like, hey, you know, I know what's going on here, and I'm willing  to partake? 
[01:52:30]  Well, he wanted to save me.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  He got us a crusader.  I mean, when I got out, I tried seeing him, but he kind of got crazy, so that was that.  He got crazy.  Yeah.  You were in the joint.  All right, so he calls you down to the medical office, then what happens?  You know, he'd have his buddies look out, because, you know, they all kind of had their  own thing going on on the side.  You know, they're all married and everything, and that's just what they do.  All right, so what's the move?  We need to hear the move. 
[01:53:00]  You're in the medical.  Yeah, how did it first go down?  You know, you just start talking, and, you know, you tell them your sad story, and they  feel bad, and then, you know, he starts complimenting you, and then, you know, his buddies do the  look out.  It's usually later, you know, during the day or on the shift, and, you know, you have to  make sure that his people, you know, cover his back.  Uh-huh.  So what's the move?  It's just kind of, you know, it's an agreement when you're in there. 
[01:53:30]  I mean, they know what's going on.  I mean...  So does he lean over and kiss you?  Yeah, and then, you know, it just goes from there.  Do you lead to McDonald's as he's doing it?  Are you, uh, and you guys go all out, or what?  Yeah, and I mean, like I said, I tried to continue the relationship once I got out, but he was just  too crazy.  Were you into it?  At the time, yeah.  How long did you see him for once you got out?  A couple months.  Okay.  So you're 18.  When did you start doing heroin? 
[01:54:00]  Oh, 15.  Yeah, you got him.  Yeah.  How old are you now?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm 25.  I've been clean for three years.  I went back to school and everything.  Oh.  What do you do now?  What?  What do you do?  Oh, I'm still in school for, uh, nursing.  All right.  I want to, I want to, I want to help all the young, uh, women that were like me.  So if the patient's...  And you also want to get into that drug cabinet.  Are you kidding?  If a patient brings you in, uh, say some cigarettes and something to eat, do you sleep with a patient? 
[01:54:30]  What?  She's going to be one of these nurses that, uh, guys dream about, man.  You're in, you're in, you're in, uh, the hospital with a broken leg and there you go.  She's ready to go.  For a sponge bath, right?  All right.  Thank you, Jocelyn.  Bye, Jocelyn.  Uh, this guy wants to defend ultrasounds.  Charlie in Jersey, what's up?  Defend ultrasounds.  How are you doing?  How are you defending ultrasounds?  All right, listen, first of all, Rich, I'm happy for you.  You're having a baby.  That's fantastic.  But nobody outside your family wants to see the ultrasound pictures.  Okay?  Yeah, but so why are you, it says you want to defend ultrasounds. 
[01:55:00]  I want to defend them because they're good for determining whether, for instance, your wife needs an amniocentesis.  Oh, I get all that.  I get the medical reasons, but the new thing is.  You're not bringing an x-ray around going, hey, look at my skull.  Yeah, but the new thing is to drag these ultrasound pictures out because it's, the pictures are a little clearer than the old days.  And you're showing them off like they're, like the kids are already like playing Little League.  We put you on, I got them framed in the mantle. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, on a fake Sports Illustrated cover.  Rich, you brought them in because you want us to be impressed.  No, no, I brought them in because when we talked about family dysfunction, to make the point, like I said.  No, I don't, I'm sorry.  Who would bring ultrasound?  You're trying to like, you're not carrying that around as a gag.  Do you have your pride and joy cards too?  No, you're, I'm Rupert Pupkin.  There is. 
[01:56:00]  Nobody shows ultrasounds.  No one's ever come up to me and said, hey, do you want to see my ultrasound?  I know you don't show those.  People don't care about that.  Do you think that Rich was just trying to be serious and like, and then he got laughed at and I feel embarrassed?  Because this has happened to me, some other, you know, with other people.  I'm like, what are you doing?  I'm, I'm, I'm happy that you're going to have a kid, but.  Yeah, don't get this.  Don't get us wrong, Rich.  We are happy that you're having a kid and everything.  Don't make me look, don't make me feel uncomfortable as I'm looking at a picture of a blob and I have to go, oh, wow. 
[01:56:30]  I wish you and Bonnie the best, you know, but, but the ultrasound, come on.  Yeah.  Well, they do videos now of unborn babies.  Oh, Jesus, imagine how they sit down in front of that when you get invited over.  Here, sit down.  We're going to watch an ultrasound.  Who cares?  You're going to just cut in some porno, some pornography in the middle of it to spice it up.  A child porn.  Oh, Jesus, Rich.  All right, Charlie, thank you.  You're going to be a father again.  Will you stop at this?  Good point.  Boy or girl?  Girl.  And then when you have a kid, I think parents should also do this.  Take a bunch of pictures of your kid and then give them to your friends and they have to write on the back, cute or ugly, but without saying who they are. 
[01:57:00]  That way you get a real consensus on what people think.  If your kid's ugly, don't go showing pictures.  If it's a cute kid, like some people show me pictures and go, look at the kid and you go, oh, that kid's cute.  And you're kind of making a face like, oh, my God, this kid is brutal.  Nothing worse than looking at a picture and the kid is so freaking ugly.  Brutal.  And you know the person and you just don't even know what to say because, you know, the parent even knows it's ugly. 
[01:57:30]  They got to know.  But they're just hoping that they're going to be like a pianist or something.  Yeah.  Then there's the adorable picture.  You're just like, okay, now this kid's adorable.  Right.  By the way, look at a picture like a puppy.  Rich, you got weak sperm.  Why do I have weak sperm?  What happened?  Third girl.  That means my sperm is weak?  Yeah, there was a thing in the medical books that came out recently.  Sorry that my sperm isn't pumping iron.  I had to be in prison, all right?  Sorry.  I know I got enough of it. 
[01:58:00]  That makes it up in numbers.  We're obviously very happy for you.  You know that.  Where's the gig, Rich?  Oh, Poughkeepsie Bananas this weekend.  Oh, tonight?  You do that tomorrow and Saturday.  No, just Friday and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday?  That'll be tomorrow and Saturday.  You said tonight.  No, but first you said tonight, all right?  So don't act like you.  I just did Poughkeepsie.  I was mobbed.  Yeah.  All right, bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Oh, you're a big drawl.  All right, it's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:58:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Great.  Now we look even worse in Britain's eyes.  Rich Voss went over to England.  He just said something else that's stupid.  Yeah, during every commercial, he just says something stupid.  You're not allowed to talk unless the mics are on.  Yeah.  It wasn't just jumping off a book, you know, when you're talking about something else.  It wasn't dumb.  It was just he's such a skinflint.  Yeah, he's also cheap.  No, I'm not.  I'll pay for dinner.  I'll do stuff like that. 
[01:59:00]  Well, this is cheap, then, what you did.  It was just timing.  What did you do?  You're a pinch penny.  No, I'm not at all.  By the way, you're listening to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss.  Schisler.  What did you do, O.B. and Anthony?  When we were in England, we just, instead of those stupid bus tours, we just took the  double-decker bus on our own, sat up top, and asked questions as we were driving around.  And we had, you know, a map, so we knew where we were driving past.  Could you imagine the dumb questions?  Sometimes, like, England just thinks we're all retarded because people like Rich go over  there and go, I didn't want to see the big clock.  I want to see Big Ben. 
[01:59:30]  No, it is a clock.  Yes.  How long until you realize that when they said you wanker, that wasn't a compliment?  I think they like me.  They're calling me a wanker.  The TV show was fun.  Patrice killed.  It was good.  You know.  How much time did you have to do?  20 minutes.  So, you killed on a TV program over there?  Yeah, it was fun.  Cool.  The taping was cool.  Great.  Kim in Pennsylvania. 
[02:00:00]  Kim.  No one can see the show, Rich.  Hit it, Kim.  Yes, it comes on BBC America.  Oh.  I watch that all the time.  Yeah.  I don't even know where it is on my cables.  I have a Tito.  Between Doctor Who episodes.  Right.  What the hell's on?  Doctor Who is a scumbag.  Somewhere in the middle of a Benny Hill marathon.  They're going to show your show.  That's cool.  Monty Python.  Right.  Kim, what's up?  Yeah.  I was calling in about the sonogram.  I had two things to say to that guy.  Yeah.  Wait. 
[02:00:30]  My name's Rich Voss.  I'm sorry, what?  Rich Voss.  Not that guy.  Okay.  Rich.  Right.  First of all, you can get a 3D sonogram done.  I have an 11-month-old, and it shows the baby much clearer.  I said that already.  Why didn't you go 3D?  With your ultrasound?  We wanted to do that.  Some guy in Philly, a listener to O&A, said to come down.  He'll do it for us for free.  How long is it?  So I got the regular ones and the 3D glasses from the movie theater for free.  Rich.  You've had a pretty good career. 
[02:01:00]  I still do.  Why are you searching out some guy?  I'm not searching out.  He emailed me and said, would you like to go?  Why don't you just...  Jesus.  This is your kid.  This is your wife.  Why don't you go to like...  A reputable place.  Why don't you go to like...  Knowing you, you went to like somewhere in Philly to someone's basement.  We didn't go yet.  Wait, wait, wait.  What did I miss?  I don't know.  You didn't go yet?  No, for the 3D one.  For the 3D one?  Oh, the guy's offering you a 3D?  Some guy's basement where he runs a mouse over her stomach connected to the computer. 
[02:01:30]  And has a picture already up on his computer screen.  You just want to see your wife naked.  Yeah, take your clothes off.  All he has to do is say she's funny.  And then he's going to call us from another room.  Guys, you're not going to believe this.  But I pulled it off.  I got Bonnie naked.  He just clicks and like a video comes up on his...  Right.  On his display that he just rolls for everybody because no one knows their baby through a sonogram.  So wait a minute.  Now, you have to go to Philly for this?  Yeah, if we do it, I didn't say... 
[02:02:00]  Why don't you just get it done in Jersey?  I wasn't even planning on doing a guy email.  How many times do you get emails from listeners saying, hey, I want to do this?  I want to do a medical procedure on you or your wife?  None.  Ever.  Yeah, Rich, maybe a free meal at a restaurant is one thing.  Maybe someone wants to hook me up with, you know, car parts or something like that.  It's not like, hey, do you want a appendectomy?  Yeah, a spinal tap, right.  Some tooth pulled or something.  We understand the freebies that are involved with doing what we do, but you got to draw the line 
[02:02:30]  somewhere.  Draw the line when it comes to your child and your wife.  Here's a word of advice, Chisler.  You don't want the guy photographing your soon-to-be-born fetus wearing a traveling virus t-shirt.  And we love Philly.  We love our listeners in Philly.  Probably, but you really want to trust one of those guys?  You don't think you have doctors and lawyers listening to you?  No.  Did you hear the phone calls today?  Prisoners.  Prisoners, right.  So, Kim, no guy wants to see a sonogram, right? 
[02:03:00]  No.  Hell no.  I mean, come on.  The last thing he wants to see is a sonogram.  He wants to, he's probably, like, thinking, like, if Rich's wife is hot, he's probably,  his imagination goes straight to, like, oh, is she going to get fat?  Or he's probably imagining, like, whacking off to her, like, as they're having sex or something,  you know?  The last thing he wants to think about is...  A sonogram.  A sonogram.  A sonogram.  Because she is hot.  No guy wants to see a sonogram.  What kind of guy sees a sonogram and gets hard, okay? 
[02:03:30]  Gets excited.  Who are you hanging out with?  Well, I'm just saying he's not looking at the sonogram.  He is imagining...  Sonogram.  Do you see the sign?  I saw the sonogram.  I saw the sonogram.  All right.  Where the hell are you from?  Oh, PA.  All right.  Thank you, Kim.  Let's go wash something.  Go wash.  There was something, something, something.  Sonogram.  A sonogram.  Is she hot? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, man.  That accent.  Oh, my mind just went blank.  It was something important, too.  Uh-oh.  Angel.  Well, the...  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, I was thinking, like, a goofy contest for the listeners, because they like Photoshopping  and stuff.  I want to put, like, Rich Voss' Baby to Be in movies.  You've got to get a video.  Yeah.  Get the sonogram video.  How much does it cost?  Get the video so we can put it up on the website.  And then our listeners will put your kid to be in movies.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Oh.  Could they do something with the...  Photoshop it.  They could Photoshop the pictures you were showing us today.  No, do it.  Get a movie, though, and we'll put them in, like, little scenes.  Well, maybe we could start with the pictures, and then we move up to live action.  Yeah.  Get some video.  If I could set it up.  What do you want to...  What do you name her?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He knows.  He knows.  Now he's not saying it.  That was so I know, but I don't want to say it.  I want a biblical name, and she wants a pure name.  I just can't stand you.  Why?  A biblical name?  You're not religious or...  What's a biblical name? 
[02:05:00]  Biblical name.  I'm more like my daughter...  God?  Cleopatra.  You know, Jessica Ellen.  You know, a Jewish type name.  Cleopatra?  Cleopatra.  What are you...  Cleopatra?  Cleopatra in the Bible.  How about Caligula, stupid...  What testament is Cleopatra?  Cleopatra.  What testament?  Is that the new new testament?  Oh, my God.  Is he the best?  You never disappoint, Rich.  Cleopatra. 
[02:05:30]  Cleopatra.  What a biblical name.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  And my son, Caesar.  Yeah.  Moby Dick.  From the book of Revelations.  You are a treat, man.  And Bonnie wants what kind of name?  Maybe...  A name for the Bible, Zeus.  And Bonnie wants a new husband.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  The boss had a good line. 
[02:06:00]  Everyone missed.  Oh.  BCH from Whackbag.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  There's so few and far between that I thought he'd...  That's not true.  Go ahead.  Opie said that Sonogram guy just wanted to see Bonnie naked, and Rich said that all he'd  have to do was say she was funny.  Yes, that wasn't very funny.  Oh, damn.  I'm sorry, Rich.  I should have given you a little love.  Thank you.  A little love over that.  All right.  I got a quick public service announcement for the Long Island Expressway.  What happened?  I drive in every morning.  Yeah.  The past two weeks, that NYPD car that is parked by Casina is empty. 
[02:06:30]  There hasn't been a cop sitting in it for two weeks.  Don't step on the brakes.  Thank you.  Well, they're putting empty cop cars now on the side of the road to slow people down.  It's making it dangerous.  People jam on their brakes when you're doing like 80.  The car was...  When it snowed the other day, the cop car's sitting there with a windshield full of snow.  He's like, at least have a cop drive by and run the wipers.  Right.  So maybe they think a cop's in there.  They turn the heat on every once in a while.  Turn the heat on every once in a while. 
[02:07:00]  The frosted damn thing.  That's really funny.  The car's been sitting there for two weeks, and people just slam on the brakes.  There's no cop in it.  It's probably not even a real cop car.  It's probably just an older car.  No, it's a real NYPD car.  It's still being used?  It's parked as if it's doing radar.  You're saying maybe it's an older one that they don't use anymore.  They just put it there.  They just put it there?  Maybe.  Look, we're on to you.  Move it.  You're just slowing down my commute.  They do that everywhere.  They do that in a lot of residential areas.  Put a dummy in there.  Rich, what are you doing tonight? 
[02:07:30]  All right, listen.  MacBook Karaoke's back.  Thanks for reminding me.  We've got to get this in.  Go to www.923freefm.com for details.  We had a lot of fun with this the first time around.  We brought it back.  We found a star, the I Saw the Sign Girl.  I Saw the Swing Girl.  Pamela.  She's coming in next week to defend herself and the pictures we found of her.  Pictures.  This is like Idol, because there are pictures of her on the Internet of a sexual nature.  Oh, yeah.  And she's a horrible singer.  Yeah.  But where she's not kicked off the show. 
[02:08:00]  Wow, this is exactly like Idol.  Where's Steve?  Because she said something like she's not ashamed of the pictures, but she wants to defend herself  and say she's not a slut or something.  She's just young.  Yeah.  It's going to be unbelievable next week.  It's Pamela, the girl that sang I Saw the Sign.  Steve.  Yeah.  What is she saying about those pictures?  Oh, she's not saying she's not ashamed of them, but she's not afraid to talk about them.  She'll talk about them.  Believe me, I think she's embarrassed by them, but she'll give the show.  She was at a little party, I guess, and pictures were taken of her and another girl. 
[02:08:30]  Ah, looks like she might have been in prison.  Yeah, something like that.  I thought I was watching Linda Blair from, what was that movie?  E-Rock.  Born Innocent.  Born Innocent.  From 1974.  E-Rock really pretty much ruined the last half hour of the show, playing this video from  YouTube over and over and over again.  Yeah, it was the rape scene.  Probably the hottest thing I've seen on YouTube in a long time.  What's the hot search today?  We should start a new bit.  Hot search for YouTube.  Like some dumb word or phrase you would never think of throwing in that search engine 
[02:09:00]  to get the hot videos.  Born Innocent.  Well, no, how'd you get this?  What did you throw in the search engine for that one?  Linda Blair.  Linda Blair.  Was that easy?  Yep.  Born Innocent starring Linda Blair, 1974 TV movie.  Check it out.  She's being held down and they ripped her clothes off.  Yeah, then they're using some kind of object.  An object.  That's a year after the exorcist and she's already doing stuff like this?  Yeah.  That's quite a drop-off, huh?  Thank God. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  So, MacBook Karaoke.  Details.  Yeah, you go to 923freefm.com.  Win the new MacBook.  Sleek and sexy.  Create everything from music, movies, greeting cards, podcasts, websites, and more.  Sonograms.  Sonograms, possibly, sure.  You could put Rich Vox's sonogram in a movie.  Photoshop it, yeah.  I think we could have fun with that.  We've got to take the still, throw it online so they can at least Photoshop it.  I think Iraq already did.  No, he was just showing the PalTal cameras.  Scan them.  Head to the Apple Store or Apple.com to check it out. 
[02:10:00]  All right?  Right.  Rich, get the plug in.  We've got to get out of here.  Kipsy Bananas this weekend.  Kipsy.  And we're losing Jimmy for a couple days.  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania tonight through Sunday.  Improv.  And I'll be on Pittsburgh Radio tomorrow and Pittsburgh TV tonight.  Who cares?  I want to watch.  I know.  It's a fancy news show.  Interview in the hotel room.  I can have some vile horse pornography up on my computer screen when they walk in.  Just be surprised if they're there.  Just open the door naked. 
[02:10:30]  I'll have a tent and I'll just have a pause on the movie, not realizing they're coming in.  Like, oh, come on in.  Oh, my God.  I should do that.  How funny would that be?  Some gross porn.  And they will all have to pretend they don't notice it.  Sitting there, paused on the screen.  Like my screen picture.  It should be like the guy on the fence with Mr. Ed about to do some intestinal damage.  Just be naked with Rich Voss' sonogram pictures.  All right, guys. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, thank you.  It was fun today.  Bye.  Bye.  See you.  Bye.  We'll see you at where.  Where are we going?  XM?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're not joining us over there, well, go after yourselves.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:12:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:12:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  THE END 
[02:14:30]  Ah...  We're on!  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  Do you think someone is listening to us for the first time right now?  Yep.  Yes.  Right now.  Every day. 
[02:15:00]  Every day that someone new.  Every ding-dong day.  You really think that?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Odds are.  I think, uh...  Yeah.  Every day that someone new.  Where do we start?  Rich Voss still in studio.  We've got a recap for the new person.  Everything we've done for two and a half years.  All right.  Well, I was doing this show at BAB on Long Island.  Yeah, there.  And...  And...  Shut up!  And...  And...  Yeah, Rich Voss joining us today.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:15:30]  We've got lots to do over here, by the way.  And we've got to start by talking about what happened at Free FM.  We kind of pussed out.  See, this is what's different than other radio shows.  We openly admit when we puss out.  Is that really a puss out?  I think so.  I think it's a...  We wouldn't have been able to give it our all.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  I was thinking that, too.  You're right.  We wouldn't have been able to really give it our all.  Well, they decided to walk in some clients at the end of our Free FM show.  We knew this was happening, but I guess we kind of forgot that they were coming today. 
[02:16:00]  And then I'm thinking, what's the big deal?  We perform in front of people all the time.  We get a live studio audience here over at XM almost every day.  So I'm like, yeah, whatever.  Throw them on a couch.  Who gives a crap?  We're not even going to see them, basically, if we're focusing on what we're doing.  And looking at each other, right?  So we're getting really excited.  Commercials are playing.  And we're going to come back and do the South Park episode from last night.  They dedicated a whole episode to the N-word.  Classic.  And they played off the Michael Richards thing and all that stuff, right? 
[02:16:30]  Everybody's talking about this South Park episode.  Everybody.  And we're just about ready to come out of commercials and go into the South Park thing.  And they walk in.  Uh, uh, uh.  Uh, uh.  There were two people, one of which was an African-American woman.  Oh, no, one's a.  An African-American woman was in there.  I didn't know what was happening because Ope just kept saying, worst timing in radio history. 
[02:17:00]  I just kept saying that under my breath, like hoping someone would get the clue.  I know.  Bring them back another day.  I'm like, worst timing in radio history.  Yeah, but she was.  And everyone's just smiling.  They got the cameras out.  She seemed like she was, you know, fine with everything.  She was light-skinned.  So she was cool.  And then I'm thinking, you know, why not?  Because we have no problem doing this.  Why not make everybody uncomfortable?  And then I'm like, I wasn't feeling it.  And then I think that's the reason, Ann. 
[02:17:30]  We couldn't give it our all.  Yeah, I don't think we would have been able to really give it our all without, like, you know, just thinking about it or something.  You know what, if an Orthodox Jew walked in with a wall he was praying on, you would have done a Jew bit, okay?  Well, that's true.  You know.  Like I said earlier, you got to know your place.  You Jews don't make as much of a ruckus.  Yeah, you got to know your place out there.  You're right, Rich.  Like, you hear how wimpy we were with the prison dudes today?  Pick your shots.  Half those people we want to hang up on, I mean, let's not kid ourselves.  But, you know.  But they're prison dudes. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you.  Oh, if it's some chick, some soccer mom, no problem.  So long.  Yeah.  So long, fatso.  But prison dudes, insult them and everything.  Yeah, let them babble as long as they want.  That's what happens.  You're staring on stage and you look, all of a sudden you see some guy with a tear under his eye.  Yeah, the teardrop tattoo.  You know what, maybe I should back off.  But if you ever question how great we really are.  Oh.  We proved it today because we had nothing else.  We're like, this was the bit. 
[02:18:30]  This was our stairway to heaven for the day.  This was our go-to bit.  This was it.  This was the encore.  And also, I look at it and I'm like, all right, we'll make up something because we just  decided we're not going there.  Yeah.  So we got more prison stories.  The prison stuff was great.  I love talking to those prisoners.  All right.  We got to get this in because Rich took a beating today.  Let's say hi to Brian in Chicago.  Brian listening on WCKG still because they're an hour behind. 
[02:19:00]  Brian, what's up?  I'm on the XM side.  I'm driving my truck.  Hey, can you go with it a little bit?  This is my way to make believe you guys are supporting the local stations.  Jesus.  Holy crap.  I know you're listening on XM because I picked up an XM line here.  I listen when I'm at home, though.  All right.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, I just want to let you know how right you are, man.  I had seen Voss a couple weeks ago.  You know how they say people got like an evil twin?  Voss must have a stupid twin because he kills on stage versus radio. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, thank you.  Versus radio.  That's a backhanded compliment.  Here's the deal with Rich Voss.  It's got to be said.  He kills on the radio show, too.  Oh, yeah.  But it's not clever.  He doesn't mean to be funny.  It's not intelligent.  Accepted.  Wow, again, slightly backhanded compliment.  First of all, you know what?  But then he hits the stage.  It's like, wow, this is the same fucking guy.  This can't be that blithering idiot I heard earlier.  First of all.  First of all. 
[02:20:00]  Fitz are well thought out on stage, and he pronounces everything beautifully.  Listen, you can take any time I've been in the studio, and I always come through.  You know, these idiots that go, well, he stinks on radio.  You know what?  Fuck, I know what I'm doing on radio.  I know my, where I'm, you know, I know what I'm doing.  All right?  What are you doing?  Whatever the fuck I'm doing.  You know what I'm doing.  Whatever he's doing, he's doing it.  All right?  And here's the thing.  I know radio.  But thank you for coming to the show in Chicago.  Thank you, man.  That was fun, man.  How do you buy a bunch of DVDs?  And let's be honest. 
[02:20:30]  Rich Voss was the glue that kept the O&A traveling virus together, man.  He did a great job for us.  He certainly was.  He certainly was.  Unfortunately, you won't be there this year, man.  It's just, people are going to definitely miss you.  Yeah, Colin Quinn was cheaper, so, you know.  Yeah.  You're going to be getting that call soon.  Colin, Colin.  Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.  Ah, well.  And now the phone calls later.  Is it true?  I never know if you're joking or not, so I figured I'd call and ask you personally.  Hey, they called your show a lot, too, when he was on the show, too. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  Thanks, man.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Thanks.  Let's go to a first-time listener.  This is Mark in North Carolina.  Oh, Mark?  Yeah, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hi, Mark.  I'm a first-time listener.  Pretty cool.  But I got something to say about that little bit I heard about Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Those Brits are pieces of garbage, and I was overseas at war, and they stopped war for tea. 
[02:21:30]  That's old.  They were playing a rerun from years ago when I called from England.  Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the first thing you heard, huh, in 202.  That was a while ago.  And was that a joke?  They're going to stop war for tea?  No, that's serious.  They do that?  Yeah, they stop for tea.  Well, I don't think in the middle of combat they would stop for tea.  Oh, no, no.  But like...  Yeah, somebody drives by in a tank.  Do you have any Grey Poupon?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:22:00]  Jimmy's reading, like, People Magazine or something like that.  He didn't even look up.  He just continued reading and just went, oh.  Just disgust.  All right.  I'm looking at just a picture of Ozzy with Sharon and Simon Cowell.  Ozzy just looks old.  He looks old.  Oh.  That's okay.  Oh.  Well, the guy's not doing the job anymore.  No, no, it's not his hair.  He didn't get away with the guy for a while.  I think that accident he had kind of took a lot out of him, too.  It's only his face.  He's just an older man's mouth.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Mark, thanks.  Good luck with the show.  You're going to need it. 
[02:22:30]  Thanks.  You're going to have a lot of ups and a lot of downs with this thing.  Enjoy the ride.  Enjoy my life.  All right.  There goes Mark, first-time listener.  We do have a lot to do.  Danny came up with a new bit called Porn Libs.  It's going to be really, really good.  But first, finally, South Park.  South Park.  Yeah, it's about time.  Unedited?  Unedited, yeah.  So it's better over here, anyway.  Yeah.  So stop beating us up for not doing it over here.  Head up.  That's right.  It gets better over here. 
[02:23:00]  So South Park did the...  The N-word.  The N-word.  It was called the nigger guy episode.  Was it?  Nigger guy.  Did they name it that?  Mm-hmm.  Did they say that?  Mm-hmm.  I don't think it was.  Mm-hmm.  You're making that up, LPG.  I'm...  What happened?  I really am believing you, too.  Yeah.  I'm like, why did Comedy Central let them do that?  And they wouldn't let...  I'm such an asshole.  What?  Oh, it was in parentheses.  Ah.  In parentheses.  In parentheses.  Parentheses.  There's some parentheses there. 
[02:23:30]  But that's what they are pretty much calling it behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Working title.  Yeah.  Working title.  There's a working title here.  Randy, Stan's dad, of course, gets the final round of Wheel of Fortune wrong.  Mm-hmm.  This is very, very funny.  And now back to Wheel of Fortune.  All right, Randy.  Congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round.  Thanks, Pat.  You've got some family here watching tonight. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, they're all rooting for me.  And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home.  Yeah.  Hi, everybody watching in South Park.  That's us.  Hey, hey.  Hi, Randy.  Hey, Randy.  Good luck.  The category is people who annoy you.  Okay.  As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E.  We just need three more consonants and a vowel.  Okay, I'd like a B, an N, and a G. 
[02:24:30]  And the vowel?  O, and O, please.  Okay, well, looks like you're going to get a lot of help here.  Category is people who annoy you.  Audience, keep quiet, please.  Uh, well, uh.  Ten seconds, Mr. Marshall.  I guess this is the, we have to explain.  Danny, go ahead.  I just was going to say that this is, you know, key to this clip is that on the Wheel of Fortune board,  it just says, with all the letters that they've given him now, it just says N-blank-G-G-E-R-S. 
[02:25:00]  Let me ask you.  These fucking guys, God bless us.  Does he not know, or does he just not want to say it?  Uh, the guy in the clip.  Stanza.  Well, he's, you know, he wants to say it, but he's not quite sure if he should or not.  Okay, right.  God bless these guys.  They don't give a crap.  Matt and Trey.  We used to have a nice relationship with these guys before they got massively huge.  They're giant dudes now, yeah.  Now they don't even remember that they ever talked to us. 
[02:25:30]  We helped them out back in the day.  Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.  Well, I know it, but I don't think I should say it.  Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.  All right, I'd like to solve the puzzle.  Niggers!  Uh...  Huh?  Oh.  Ooh.  Oh, naggers, of course.  Naggers.  Right.  Can we cut to, uh... 
[02:26:00]  Can we cut to a...  The old off-the-air thing.  Oh, God.  He just blurs it out.  Stunned audience.  Stunned host.  Oh, man.  That could be one of the funniest clips ever.  Right there.  You might have just...  They got some set, man.  That's great.  Heard the funniest clip ever.  Well, Stan tries to explain to Token, and Cartman screams race war. 
[02:26:30]  What's this one about again there, Danny?  I don't really understand.  Well, because everybody...  It was replayed on, like, the South Park News in the morning.  Yeah.  So everybody knew what was going on.  So, obviously, Token is the black guy on South Park.  Right.  So Stan thought that he should apologize to Token for what his dad said.  All right.  My dad isn't a racist.  He's just stupid, all right?  He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?  Uh, well, actually, it is kind of a big deal, Stan. 
[02:27:00]  Uh?  It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up.  So don't say it isn't a big deal.  Oh, s***.  Here we go.  It's on.  Race war.  Race war.  Race war.  Race war's on, everybody.  It's going down.  S*** is going down.  Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive.  Just forget about it.  That's easy for you to say, Stan.  Yeah, come on.  Here we go.  Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.  That doesn't mean I can just be fine.  Race war.  Come on.  Race war.  If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. 
[02:27:30]  That's all.  I'm not fighting anybody.  Token for this.  Whites win.  Whites win.  Race war's over, everybody.  Whites won again.  Again.  Goddamn, Carmen.  Oh, how bad do I want that race war clip in my machine?  You'll have it.  Yeah, this next clip, Stan goes to the Laugh Factory, is recognized as nigger guy.  Randy leaves upset. 
[02:28:00]  Damn.  We got a great crowd here tonight.  Now, how many people here are actually from Colorado?  Yeah.  Yo.  Wee.  Got nothing better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh?  Hey.  Don't I know you from somewhere?  Yeah.  I know you.  You're the guy that said nigger on the wheel of fortune.  Look, everybody. 
[02:28:30]  It's the nigger guy.  Hey, it is him.  Oh, we got a star in the club.  Everyone wave to the nigger guy.  Say hi, nigger guy.  Hi, nigger guy.  That's all right, nigger guy.  You know we just planned.  Yeah.  No problem.  Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days?  Damn things look like they're right out of far out space nuts. 
[02:29:00]  Maybe nigger guy has one.  You got one, nigger guy?  He's killing.  He's killing.  Hey, look, Betty.  It's that nigger guy.  Nigger guy, nigger guy.  Hey.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:29:30]  Hey.  What do you think you're doing?  I just need some aspirin.  You aren't welcome in this store, nigger guy.  Man, they got away with murder on that show.  They always do.  Yes, they do.  It's amazing.  They always do.  Uh, by the way, the pad data will not be changing, uh, this morning.  Oh?  Got a little problem.  A lot of people feedbacking.  Why?  Saying change the pad data.  Suddenly listen to the show. 
[02:30:00]  We break it up by changing the pad data.  Oh, really?  But today there's a little problem with the computer.  What's the problem?  Are they going to fix it then?  It might not be fixed today, but it'll be fixed tomorrow.  Okay.  So just deal with it for one day.  All right.  Next clip.  Randy tries to erase his identity as nigger guy.  And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African American students 
[02:30:30]  and erase once and for all my identity as the nigger guy.  You really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past.  I mean, I just want to move on from what happened on Wheel of Fortune, you know.  And when people call me nigger guy, they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history  and all the negativity that went along with it. 
[02:31:00]  You just can't imagine how that feels.  Is this nigger guy serious?  As we move on here, a few rednecks running to Randy.  He is saved by Michael Richards and Mark Furman, of all people.  Hey, look, Skeeter.  That's that guy from the TV.  Well, well, well.  Looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy. 
[02:31:30]  Oh!  Where you going, nigger guy?  Please, I don't want any trouble.  Well, you got trouble.  When you first decided to slander an entire race of people on Wheel of Fortune.  Yeah.  You like making fun of minorities, nigger guy?  We don't take kindly to social ignorance.  You don't, Skeeter.  You tell him.  What do you want?  What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans. 
[02:32:00]  Leave him alone.  Hey, that's that other nigger guy.  Huh?  That's the guy from Seinfeld used the N-word a whole bunch of times.  Michael Richards?  Well, son of a bitch.  Looks like it's our lucky day.  We done got us two nigger guys.  Make that three. 
[02:32:30]  Mark Furman?  Who?  He done said the N-word in the OJ case.  What is this, a nigger guy convention?  We aren't being pushed around anymore.  Leave.  Come on, Skeeter.  These nigger guys ain't worth our trouble.  Damn nigger guys!  We'll be back!  There you go.  Not the funniest clip, obviously.  No, no.  I don't care.  Should have started with that one.  Yeah, how the hell are they getting away with that? 
[02:33:00]  I don't get that the rent.  On Comedy Central.  I don't get that the rent.  Well, because Comedy Central only edits you if you're a white guy.  My thing is, what are the points of Matt and Trey are making with this?  It's funny, but I mean, what are they making?  Are they making fun of the liberal whites?  Are they making fun of the fact that white people feel victimized by not being mostly married?  You can never tell with that.  They used the word so much, it just doesn't mean anything.  Like, it's so saturated.  I think they just figured they could get the word on TV.  Yeah, get the word on TV a hundred times.  They don't give a clue.  We had a sketch in Tough Crowd with nigger in it, and they wouldn't let Colin say it  because he's not Chappelle or a cartoon. 
[02:33:30]  No.  So if you're black or a cartoon, you could say it?  That's the rules.  According to Comedy Central?  Yeah.  The Comedy Central, yeah, figures as long as you could take the show off the air and no  one would call, then you could say whatever you want.  No, wait.  No, we had a lot of...  I'm teasing.  Wow.  I was only joking.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay now.  He was just joking. 
[02:34:00]  Just joking.  Yeah, we couldn't say.  All right, finally, Randy goes to Washington, gets a nigger guy banned from the language.  Something that's kind of going on.  So maybe this...  Well, that's why.  They usually do episodes that are topical, and I think they're goofing on the whole thing  that you can't use the word.  Yeah.  Senators, I know it is not normally considered American to ban words, but there is one slur  that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal.  I'm talking, of course, about the term nigger guy. 
[02:34:30]  Nigger guy?  Two words which, by themselves, can be harmless, but which together form a verbal missile of  hate.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, sure.  Some people just use the term in jest.  Tell a nigger guy joke or two, thinking it's no big deal, but they don't realize it can  lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.  Goddamn nigger guy's trying to be all political right now.  Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having slightly racist thoughts 
[02:35:00]  once in a while.  Can anybody say they never do?  How long will it be before you are all called nigger guys?  Uh, hold on a second.  Are you suggesting that nigger guy could become a slur that refers to all white people?  I am certainly not a nigger guy.  I've never thought a racist thought.  Oh, come on.  You're the biggest nigger guy in Washington.  Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill.  All those in favor to ban the term nigger guy?  Aye. 
[02:35:30]  Opposed?  Nay.  The motion is passed.  For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.  From now on, if a person uses the word nigger, it must be at least seven words away from the  word guy.  Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is over.  Oh, damn it.  I said it, didn't I?  Hell yeah.  There you go.  Let's go to Dave in Chicago.  Dave, what's up? 
[02:36:00]  Man, what the fuck is going on?  I'd rather listen to fucking Howard Stern fuck man cow over a bag of potato chips than your  bullshit.  We're playing this fucking comedy sectoral shit, man.  I don't pay 15 fucking dollars a month.  Listen to shit I just heard on the TV.  They're not before.  How are you?  Hey, Dave.  We did what's called...  Oh, you gotta hang up now?  That's the worst part.  I want to hear your dumb analogy again, first of all.  Just a few minutes of audio so we can comment on the fact that that word, they're trying 
[02:36:30]  to ban it.  Right.  And there's a cartoon that's just blurting it out a hundred times.  And we took a chance at something, so we ended up just listening to South Park for  a little while.  Did anyone get hurt?  Would they have let you play that on CBS?  Well, not like that.  So I'm glad that we didn't get to that today.  For many reasons, because we didn't have much comments anyway.  No, it was just kind of...  You know, those guys get away with murder over there.  It's amazing.  Dave should call back.  I'll explain how a radio show works.  You gotta take chances. 
[02:37:00]  I wonder if there's gonna be any backlash.  From that episode?  Yeah.  Okay, you know, this is, well, the Scientology one, they had backlash from that.  This one now, because this is a hot fucking topic right now.  There are people really trying to get the word banned.  Even if there's no consequence to it, they're trying to symbolically ban it.  Other people, reverends and stuff are saying it.  And there's an episode where it's used very liberally.  Just like, it had to be...  Did anyone count? 
[02:37:30]  Jesus Christ, it's gotta be a hundred times.  Let's take the word out of music.  Let's start there.  Well, that's a problem, because...  Why?  Because it's hip-hop that's using it.  And there are black guys doing that, and they have a right to that word.  That's the argument.  Yeah, that falls a little short.  I bet they catch some shit for this, though.  We should all be able to use whatever words we want.  You can't start saying that one group should be able to say it for this reason, but everyone  else should not be able to use it.  But that is just completely ridiculous. 
[02:38:00]  And what if you're half and half?  You can only go, nah.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And this jackass that was called, this jackass, of course...  Okay, so it was on TV last night.  You talk about stuff that was in the news that was on TV last night, you idiot.  He almost had a point, because we didn't have much going on as we were playing the clips.  You know, we thought we'd have a little more.  But see, this show takes chances all the time.  So maybe that fell a little short.  Yeah, we'll throw him a bone and say, yeah.  But that's why the show works, because we do take chances.  Well, you know what? 
[02:38:30]  You've got to be brave enough to fall flat on your face.  I mean, his analogy was awful.  I wanted to hear that again.  And some people enjoy just hearing the clips and what they got away with on TV.  So, there you go.  I like the one clip that was very funny about that, when he just said it on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, we should have stopped there.  Oh, no.  We should have stopped there.  Should have stopped right there.  What do you know?  We're shy.  Get a quick laugh and then move on to something else.  Always pushing it too far.  But Dave was too scared.  You know, we were actually going to sort of agree with you and then explain our...  Have a little dialogue. 
[02:39:00]  A little dialogue, but you hung up after your dumb, bad analogy about Howard fucking Mancow.  What?  I don't know.  Could someone like...  A pile of dinkers.  He'd rather...  He said he'd rather listen to that.  But of course.  Who wouldn't?  Yeah, it's hot.  You hear that?  Is Howard fucking Mancow?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you would have to listen to that.  Sure would.  And it's not even gay that you want to listen to that.  Well, watch it.  It's interesting, yeah.  And what do you mean they're trying to ban the word?  You can get arrested?  No, there's no...  Symbolically. 
[02:39:30]  Symbolically, they are going around and making laws, like putting into the books, whatever  the fuck that is, that this word shouldn't be used, or is banned.  You know who's doing that?  Oh.  Lovers.  And if you say it, though, what's the penalty?  Like, you have to move next door to one.  Yeah.  Oh.  Nothing.  You get a demerit.  You'll get one demerit.  You get a demerit, and they take a little happy face away from you.  Oh, no.  You get a gold star at the end of the day.  When I was in Vegas, a black girl walked on stage and threw a drink on me a couple weeks 
[02:40:00]  and threw a drink.  And I didn't say it, but, you know...  I offended her, so I don't know, and she threw a drink last night.  Oh, boy.  Unless I said it was the black guy doesn't like to eat the coochie bit, right?  No, I don't...  What was the bit?  Unless it's fried.  I don't know.  She was with a white guy, and I go, oh, oh, oh, I found yourself a co-signer, right?  That's a good one.  That's funny, man.  And then, you know, I trashed him or whatever, and then he left, and she stayed, and she walked  on stage and threw a drink, you know, and then I said, well, you know, maybe, 
[02:40:30]  maybe, if you think about it, Kramer wasn't wrong.  Oh, wow.  And then I said, I can't believe she wasted a whole glass of Kool-Aid.  God damn, Rich.  Rich comes alive on that stage, man.  He does.  He doesn't back down.  She wasted a whole glass of Kool-Aid.  Oh, that's brutal.  And so security came and said, do you want us to, you know...  I said, you know, don't arrest her.  I don't want to ruin her.  Yeah, what's wrong with you? 
[02:41:00]  I said, find her and scare her.  Well, they looked for her.  They couldn't find her.  Find her and scare her.  What, with torches and hound dogs?  Were they chasing her down the street?  Jesus, Rich.  She'd rather be arrested than scared a little bit.  Just put pliers on her clit and threaten her.  Break her fucking legs.  Yeah, I want to arrest her.  What the hell is that?  See, Dave, that's why we played the South Park audio, because now see what it led to?  It's leading to something.  That we're building up steam here now.  Race dialogue. 
[02:41:30]  That's right.  Let's go to Brian in Maryland.  Brian.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hi.  I go to the University of Maryland, and we're actually, there's a bunch of us local students,  and we're actually having a protest where we've gotten together with the Black Student Union,  and we want to ban that word from our campus, because it does nothing but cause pain.  It does nothing but make people upset.  You can't ban it.  How about the word rape, dude?  How about the word rape?  It's a black student.  Wait, hold on.  How about the word rape, dude?  What you're doing there, I understand the intentions are good, but it's disgusting. 
[02:42:00]  Unpopular speech has to be protected regardless of what it does.  That's it.  Schools don't follow the rules of America anymore, man.  There's another story about two girls got suspended for using the word vagina, even  though they were allowed to do the vagina monologues, but they can't say the word vagina.  Yeah.  This is a college.  Their minds in schools.  They were children.  This is a college.  This is a college.  You're the greatest offenders of free speech.  Don't you realize that's a rule? 
[02:42:30]  I agree.  But what about the First Amendment?  I agree that we have to be able to have open dialogue about this, and I agree that we  have to be able to...  Open dialogue?  Whoa, dude.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Dude, open dialogue.  It's a word.  It is not illegal.  It is not fire in a movie theater.  It's not inciting people to riot, and you can twist that any way you want.  It's offensive.  An unpopular, offensive speech has to be protected.  That's what we're based on.  What if all of a sudden religious things start to become offensive?  You can't ban it.  What's the matter with you? 
[02:43:00]  Colleges are filled with a bunch of pussies, man.  What a bunch of robots you are.  Whatever happened to just...  Well, hold on.  God, I'm...  Let's hear his point.  All right.  Listen, our meetings are this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the Improv in Pittsburgh.  They're led by James Ford.  I was going to ask her if the Black Student Union building was boarded up.  No, he got me...  Brian, you're good.  We love you.  Thank you, buddy.  Explain to Rich, because he doesn't...  I know.  I got it.  That was very funny.  God damn it.  But it's true about colleges.  We have to have an open dialogue.  Oh, he said all the things.  I wanted to choke him. 
[02:43:30]  He had every button of yours pushed, man.  Oh, my God.  Open dialogue.  But this shit is happening in schools.  I know.  Yeah.  I know it is.  The story of the vagina, where is that?  Well, just to show you what phonies are in colleges, at Columbia University, a bunch  of the students, when the Minutemen, the guy who ran the Minutemen, which stopped illegal  immigrants from coming to the country, were speaking, they rushed the stage and had him  take...  And yet they invited Chavez from fucking Venezuela.  Yeah, yeah.  And fucking they invited the Iranian president to speak, but eventually so much pressure  came that they had to rescind the invitation.  They're just...  Colleges have become filled with these self-righteous little language pigs, and they are so against 
[02:44:00]  any ideology that isn't their own.  It's not a place for...  That's why I have no respect for college students.  You're not about free thought or free expression.  At all.  Here's the vagina story.  I'm sure a lot of people have heard by now, but here it is, just in case.  At John Jay High School in Katona, one word has led to a war of words.  Last Friday night, Hannah Levinson, Megan Reback, and Alain Stahl read a line from the vagina  monologues with the word vagina in it at a school event. 
[02:44:30]  And now they're each serving a one-day in-school suspension.  I feel like I should be able to say parts of my body without being scrutinized and without  being punished.  It's just a word.  We are women.  We have vaginas.  And we think we should be able to speak about it.  I think that they should be able to say whatever they want.  I'm open mic tonight.  I really believe that they should be able to say what they want, and as long as it's  not offensive, and, you know, the word vagina is in the English language.  I kill rich cunts. 
[02:45:00]  God damn rich cunts.  You know, at a college, I was doing a college, and I just did a dumb Polish thing on some guy.  This was like five, six, seven years ago, a Polish thing.  Like, some guy just walking through the show, a teacher.  Like, it was a great show.  Just walking through, heard the word Polish, right?  And they didn't want to pay me.  Was he a comic with integrity?  No, whatever.  They didn't want to pay me.  But yet, the next week at that school, the next week at that school, Khalid Mohammed was 
[02:45:30]  speaking.  You know, he was alive.  You know, so...  I would hope so.  Yeah, but you see, you know, it's, it's, if you're white, you can't do anything in these  schools, and, and the liberals, what it is, is the professors try to brainwash you with  their ideology, and, and, and, and have you believe what they believe, instead of opening  your mind, as, as students should, to what goes on in the world, let you make your own  decision.  Let's just teach him stuff.  Keep your own fucking ideas to yourself, you self-righteous professor jack-offs. 
[02:46:00]  The liberals have fallen into the same trap that conservatives rise in.  That, for them, it's become the word hate speech.  They, when they, when I don't like what you're saying, I can't just say, I don't like you,  I don't want you to say that, because I don't like it.  That's too, that's too, uh, revealing.  It's blatantly unconstitutional.  Too revealing.  Yeah.  And it's too revealing on a personal level to, to be that fucking self-obsessed and shallow.  So they say it's hate speech, just like fucking conservatives always use family values.  Yeah.  Like, oh, that's anti-family, or that's anti, you know, they hide behind family shit, and the  liberals hide behind hate speech. 
[02:46:30]  It's their personal feelings about it.  Of course.  Just admit you don't like it, and you don't want someone else saying it, because you don't  like it.  And what's the end of story?  What's going to happen if a girl in high school says the word vagina?  Who knows?  I think she's talking to herself.  I mean, she should be able to say it.  See, the problem was, she didn't say vagina, she referred to it as smelly Mr. Ed Lips.  This is another story I was reading about, there's a very popular children's book, maybe  someone could help us out here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you know about it?  It's like a bestseller, it's in every school library, and they're trying to ban the book 
[02:47:00]  because of one lousy word.  Is it Horton Hears a Jew?  Parody.  Or the cat who likes scat.  This children's book is one of the most popular books, it's selling like crazy, and they want  to ban it.  It's Charlotte's Nick.  No, it was written by Dr. Spick.  The word is scrotum.  Really?  Scrotum.  Why would that word be in a children's book, though? 
[02:47:30]  I don't know.  It comes after the words, don't forget to tickle the...  When you don't have money in the ice cream, it's giving you a free snow cone.  I'm trying to think of what context, besides Jimmy's, the word scrotum would be in a kid's  book.  Hey, Dave.  Hey.  Are you getting the show a little bit more now?  I'm getting the show.  I love you guys.  You guys are radio gold most of the time, but today's episode, you guys did have to play 
[02:48:00]  the whole goddamn thing, did you?  Dude, but we don't know.  But we don't know.  Hold on, Dave.  I wish we had one of those things that we could see the future.  A crystal ball.  But sometimes we take a chance, and sometimes we fall flat on our faces.  I wish you had a better sound clip, editor, that you could only play maybe two clips from  it.  Yeah, we might.  The whole goddamn thing.  It would have been better if we just played the first clip.  Dude, it was one segment.  We moved on and stuff.  It was like one little segment.  What are you, judging the whole show minute by minute?  This is what fucking guys like Dave do. 
[02:48:30]  They call up and all of a sudden they want to know why we don't do show prep.  Yeah, I know.  Bastard.  We didn't have time to listen to the clips ahead of time and decide if we had anything  of substance.  Here's more on the vagina girl.  But school officials insist it's not the word vagina that troubled them.  It's insubordination.  Earlier, the girls had been asked not to read that particular line from the vagina monologues,  but they did so anyway.  Good girls.  We have younger siblings of students often at these events, and we were just trying to  be sensitive.  Yeah, we were suspended, but it was worth it because now everyone in the community is 
[02:49:00]  openly talking about it.  About vaginas.  The writer of The Vagina Monologues, Eve Ensler, who grew up in Scarsdale, has now offered  to visit the school to explain why she thinks it's important for high school age girls to  feel comfortable saying the word vagina.  Yeah.  Isn't it amazing?  We are a country of fucking wash women.  Faggots.  What a bunch of fucking faggots Americans are.  God almighty, are we a fucking nation of fucking wash women. 
[02:49:30]  They have their own constitution in schools.  They get away with murder.  We're doomed, man.  With this whole fucking, this empire that we're sitting on right now that has lasted a  couple hundred years.  We had a good run.  We had a good run.  The Chinese are coming.  But we are so on the fucking ass end of this slope here that we're just fucking doomed.  Watch that slur.  You get mad around.  Slopes are the ones that are going to.  We're raising a nation of pujas.  Bunch of pussies.  Bunch of fucking politically correct assholes who are just going to turn this whole fucking 
[02:50:00]  country upside down.  We're phonies.  Americans are phony.  The conservatives are fucking phony, too.  They wouldn't let Lenny Bruce do his act.  Come on.  They're fucking full of shit, too.  And they've been worse for us as performers than liberals.  Liberals are nudges.  The liberals are phony because they're supposed to be like this free speech oasis and they're  fucking little self-righteous cunts.  But the conservatives are the ones that have fucking, I mean, you know, crushed people.  I mean, you know, that religious influence, man, has ruined it more than the liberals will 
[02:50:30]  ever ruin it.  The liberals are just nudges.  You know, you're like, all right.  But the conservatives are abominable.  You tie in everything with conservatives with religion.  That's the big base they have is the religious right.  That's their power base, yeah.  Can I jump in really fast here?  Jump in.  Dice is going to be on Brother Weez's show in like a minute.  Oh.  I want to see how that goes.  Can we get it a little of that?  He does it out of a garage.  What?  Mancow does it out of his garage now.  Oh, my God. 
[02:51:00]  Whose go did you say you're going to be on?  Oh, I thought you said that.  Oh, my God.  Brother Weez sounds just like Mancow.  No, because of the other thing.  We got somebody listening to CMF in Rochester.  I want to see how that goes.  Yeah.  Because Weez will definitely bring up what happened to the relationship between us and Dice.  I guarantee it.  How are we going to get that done?  Someone's got a call.  Huh?  I've never heard his show.  Someone's got a call and put their phone by a speaker.  I've got to hang up on a lot of people. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, that's good, but who gives a shit?  Love the show.  Who gives a shit?  Thanks, though.  Even Wackbag doesn't let you write nigger?  What's that about?  Why?  Hey, I agree with everything you guys are saying about censorship and the words and all that.  You can't ban them.  But, dude, Wackbag bans these words, man.  You can't type rape.  There's a reason they do that, though.  They also ban the word rape on there. 
[02:52:00]  It's for search engine reasons.  When you've got a bunch of posts that have the word rape, and then you put rape in looking for something, it's going to...  Oh, that's my phone.  It's okay.  Oh, but it's not to be PC.  No, it's not to be PC.  It's fucking...  You know, you don't want your website to pop up on certain searches.  That's all.  Oh, fair enough.  Wouldn't that just make you higher on the Google list or whatever?  All right.  Well, how many people are putting nigger in searching every day?  Maybe they wind up getting...  Half our audience.  Maybe they wind up... 
[02:52:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  The other half is putting in rape.  No, dude.  I'm only guessing.  I don't know why Wackbag does it.  I'm only guessing it's because then you get these people that are going to your site for the wrong reasons.  Yeah.  You have to get them out.  You know what I mean?  It might just overrun you with just fucking people that are like not show fans.  I know the guys.  It's not...  What do you think?  Oh, that word is offensive.  I don't want to put it on there.  No.  It has to do with the search engines.  Well, it's an honor to be on the air with my host and my boys.  Frunkus.  Oh, Frunkus to you too, sir. 
[02:53:00]  Frunkus to you too.  And then Fox 5, they did the vagina story.  And, well, you got to hear their banter.  We love banter.  Listen to how ridiculous this is.  I'm wondering what the health teacher calls it.  Vajayjay.  Is that what it is?  I mean, how do you teach...  The vajayjay model.  My question is, how do you teach health?  I don't know.  Because my kids are in school and they have health courses.  The, it is the anatomically correct terminology.  Yes, it's like saying elbow. 
[02:53:30]  It's like saying elbow.  Yeah, but no one ever says you got a smelly elbow.  Yeah.  I got to work hard.  Let me put some vagina grease into it.  Bring your elbow over to your uncle.  Wee, tell him we want to listen in on the show.  Everyone's saying call we, so let's do that.  Hmm.  All right.  Yeah.  Could do that.  How do you teach health and all that?  Nothing's going to happen to your kid if he knows the word vagina and penis and scrotum.  You know.  What?  And balls and cunt.  It's like... 
[02:54:00]  Fucking sucking.  Sucking.  Your womb is so polluted.  It's like, let's make believe the kids don't know those words.  I mean, it's so stupid.  No, we just become, like Jimmy said, a bunch of faggots.  Just, this country can't deal with anything.  We live to catch each other in verbal miscues.  That's what we have become, just a bunch of little fucking bitches who want to catch each other making verbal miscues.  Gotcha.  Now your career's ended.  A country of hall monitors. 
[02:54:30]  We are a nation of fucking hall monitors.  And those girls were, I guarantee white, if those girls were Afro-American, there wouldn't have been a complaint.  They would have been on a read it.  Afro-American.  Afro-American, 1975.  I was just saying it.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, Jimmy.  I thought that deserved something.  I didn't hear you.  I was kidding.  I was kidding.  You said after they were African-American, they wouldn't have gotten any trouble.  I said, that's good.  They wouldn't have been able to read it.  All right.  Even nothing on the explanation.  All right.  Now you'll get the crash because you repeated it. 
[02:55:00]  I was overconfident.  And Ope heard it.  Voss heard it.  No one cared for it.  I'll accept that.  Ant laughed out of agreement.  I thought it was funny.  All right.  I'll take the hit.  I thought it was amusing.  Apparently not.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, yeah, porn libs.  Porn libs.  Yeah.  Danny's going to explain.  New game from Danny.  Wow.  What a chance Danny's taken.  You just said you got to take risks, right?  Sometimes people fall flat on your face.  Will Danny be coming to poker this evening? 
[02:55:30]  I certainly will.  Yes.  Danny is joining me over at the Anthony compound.  I never got invited.  You got invited last week.  Were you invited?  Yeah.  I never got invited.  Are we doing a hangover show tomorrow then?  No, no.  I did it last week too.  I learned if I don't drink.  You're learning a little bit?  Then I'm okay.  It's hard to get hungover if you don't drink.  How come you don't want me in your house?  You're my friend.  You're cordially invited.  I told you.  Because you pick your nose and he doesn't want it in his couch. 
[02:56:00]  Anytime.  Do you guys gamble?  Do you guys, I mean.  No, no, no.  No, he played poker for fun.  You know what they do?  They all have snack foods and they gamble like a few potato chips.  I meant to say, is it high stakes?  Holy shit.  What do you guys play for?  No, you didn't mean that.  You meant to gamble.  Yes, I did.  I know they didn't co-op.  He's not driving to Long Island to play goldfish.  I meant to say high stakes.  Goldfish.  My poker chips.  He's driving to Long Island because he lives there.  Yeah, because I live there.  I'm saying high stakes. 
[02:56:30]  That's what I meant.  It's not.  It's a $50 buy-in.  Yeah.  And you can bet peanuts and stuff, too.  Yeah, peanuts and cigarettes.  Cigarettes.  Things like that.  It's a prison game.  Whatever snack you bring, you can bet.  So I guess you'll be bringing blueberries.  Blueberries.  That was nothing on there.  No.  It was just a fact.  Wow.  Yeah, I guess you'll show up in that blonde hair.  All right.  You have to...  You were confident, too.  I did.  Yeah.  You looked right at me and said, wait, you hear what I have to say. 
[02:57:00]  Blueberries.  Holy Jesus.  Hey, we're playing golf soon.  Huh?  We should play in Vegas.  Oh, no.  No.  Why are you mentioning Vegas?  No one's supposed to know about that yet.  I didn't say anything.  I said...  Yeah, well...  You did, though.  Oh, what was that?  We did that.  Was that Rich?  She farted.  I didn't fart.  All right.  Lysol, please.  All right.  It's us.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby, Hagi, Bubby, shoot. 
[02:57:30]  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is...  Fuck my dick, because you ain't give me no money.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, cash up.  All day, everything.  Get that bitch, nigga.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Briefing.  We're going to be playing Porn Libs in a minute or two. 
[02:58:00]  Also, I'm hearing that Dice is going to be on Brother Weezer's show.  Yeah, apparently.  Right there.  I think this is Brother Weezer's show.  Coming back for break.  There you are.  Like a queen in your nightgown.  Yee-haw.  Shotgun from town to town.  So you're going to click on the world we've found. 
[02:58:30]  Nah, he comes back from commercials with, like, tunes he likes.  You know what I'm saying to me.  You were out.  Is Dice on?  You were born like me.  Oh, yeah?  You were playing to me.  What do you got, Sam?  He said he'll be on the scene.  He said he's going to motherfucking...  You know, he said if you want to.  Oh, wow.  Wait, he said what?  And in the studio...  One of the call screeners will pick up here.  And if you want to...  He did a guest set last night at Comics Cafe. 
[02:59:00]  Will he be doing a guest set tonight?  Hey, wait.  Is he doing it tonight?  Or is he...  This is our...  I gotta talk to...  This is my boy, Brother Weezer.  You tell him I am...  Let's not get started.  Why just listen in?  Yeah, let's listen in.  Not you.  You're the guy.  Because I was already...  He's not allowed to do XM anymore.  The company got pissed off at him.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  You're out of...  Because they're scared of satellite radio.  But it's accurate.  I need a beauty.  Have we explained it?  Even though we're on one of their stations?  It freaked me out.  They're watching me out.  And I haven't even had a cocktail yet. 
[02:59:30]  You know, I don't like being knocked off.  I don't want to hurt the brother.  I didn't either.  This one's an easy hurt.  I know.  And you're all...  You're out there.  But here's the thing.  Somebody...  Go ahead.  No.  If somebody comes to me green and wants all this help,  and you help, and you instruct,  and you see it become a success,  and then you make a move,  and it isn't authorized,  what are you doing?  Like, I'm going to be an idiot.  You tell us half the goddamn story now.  Now we're into the story.  Well, basically, J.J.  Tried to block.  All of a sudden, he's going,  why is that kid at my club? 
[03:00:00]  On my stage.  What is he doing?  He has to talk to Tommy.  You know, what's he doing on my stage?  Like, he's all of a sudden picking...  Well, wait a minute.  J.J. is a great scout.  I mean, Jerry Steinfeld was coming.  David Chappelle, Schimmel.  Yeah.  We know J.J. like a brother.  He'll be up soon.  The county owner up in Rochester.  He called Jerry Steinfeld, Jerry Steinfeld.  He was trying to get Jerry Steinfeld at his club.  We were with Lisa Lampanelli.  We were all together.  And I said, J.J., you've got to bring Lisa to the club.  So J.J. says to Lisa, send me a tape. 
[03:00:30]  I go, and she got all pissed off,  and I don't blame her.  I said, J.J., if we're telling you,  we're the one good stuff.  He's a little headline in a show.  Headline in the best of show.  She had to follow Drew Carey and killed.  He saw this.  Send me a tape.  Send me a tape.  Now, this is insulting.  But the bottom line is he respects our opinion.  Right.  So why ever, if you respect someone's opinion,  why ask, why get a phone call,  what's this kid doing on my face?  I wouldn't put you up not knowing you  unless Beth gave you the seal of approval. 
[03:01:00]  Somebody else I know that appreciates comedy  says, this kid's good.  I don't need to see you to know that you're not going to  shiz it up the joint.  I'd like to welcome back one of our dear friends from Maruga  and our favorite punching bag, J.J.  Yeah, J.J.  Oh, you guys just playing another show.  Well, you want to, uh, someone like.  Someone's got to monitor that.  Yeah, let's monitor this.  Let's see when.  I thought they were going right to him, so.  I heard briefly this morning that you guys are headed down to Austin  and I was just wondering where you guys are going to be. 
[03:01:30]  We're going to be playing a local band.  Yeah, let us know when Dice makes his appearance.  All right, you want to try to get into some porn libs?  Yeah, what is this about now?  Where's Danny?  Danny.  Danny.  Danny's gay.  Oh, look at him.  So proud.  I found a clip online this morning  and some of the things that this gentleman was saying was so intense.  I thought it would be funny to bleep out some of the choice words  and then you guys would have to guess what he's actually saying. 
[03:02:00]  And it's not as obvious as you think, right?  No, well, like, you know, the first one in there,  you might, you know, you might get it, you know, first try,  but, you know, that's why it's first anyway.  And as it kind of goes, it gets a little more, a little more difficult, like Jeopardy.  A little more deep.  All right.  We're all distracted now.  A little bit.  All right.  So this is Porn Libs.  So play the first clip.  There'll be some bleeps, and then we've got to figure out what the bleeps are.  Right.  So the first cut that you have there will have bleeps in it,  and then the track directly following will have the uncut answer. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  You can play along at home, all right?  Here's the first clip.  Porn Libs.  When I give you a command, you better move faster, you fucking slut.  I'm going to **** you all **** if you don't listen to me.  You need to be trained.  You worthless ****.  Ooh.  Long beat.  Wow.  You got to do, you got to do one.  Nice.  Oh, hold on.  Oh.  Anthony really helped this guy's career after it was gone.  His comeback.  Anthony did.  They helped it immensely.  I missed the OPN. 
[03:03:00]  Andrew Dice did a thing on TV, mentioned about this big comeback he had,  how he filled these rooms, never gave those guys their due.  Right.  Which is right.  This is why Weez is the Grinch.  So I'm going to try another Hucker Andrew Dice play.  I'm not really **** at this.  But I got to do it for OPN.  I don't know.  I've never seen a side of you.  It's going to be fun.  I don't know if I can even pull it.  The evil side of us.  Another Jewish guy.  Oh, you're already crumbling.  I'm already crumbling.  You're already crumbling.  I can't.  He doesn't have it in him.  He doesn't.  By the end, you'll be loving him.  I didn't learn this from Weez. 
[03:03:30]  I learned a lot from Weez, but not this.  See, then it'll be good.  Now, he's pushing his new reality show.  He's got it.  Following Dice.  Yeah.  Undisputed Dice on VH1.  Which I believe he's on the phone.  Sunday night at 10.  I believe he's on the phone.  Sunday nights at 10 starting.  He's already been on?  He's got a, I don't believe it has.  He's got a fiancÃ© who's a female wrestler now.  Damn.  That's interesting.  I mean, he's got to blow her off for a broad in Houston for a while,  but maybe he's not going to mention that on his TV show. 
[03:04:00]  Do they have them?  Or are they just a man?  A waiter at a comedy club in Houston?  I never see it.  You never saw girl wrestlers?  No.  Back in our day, they looked great.  We had them like crazy.  Behemoths.  How come whenever I turn on the TV and I don't look at it much,  I always see dudes with the hot chick manager act, but not broads wrestling?  No, every one of those programs has at least one girl match.  I'm always missing.  Do you remember back in the day, Galo?  The gorgeous lady, the woman, the wrestling.  Yeah.  I saw the kickboxing girls the other night.  I was over at Moe's. 
[03:04:30]  I don't know.  I'll see what he's doing.  Well, hold on.  I'm getting mother-huggered.  Now, it says on the line here.  What?  It says dice in three minutes.  What am I supposed to do?  Count it down?  It's like a shuttle.  Moe, is he going to find out when the guy's on the...  What am I supposed to do?  Do you look at my watch?  I have a great story here that we didn't do today.  We got tons of that.  No, but this one's...  We can't get into something and then stop.  They're in filler mode.  I love it.  We're in another show.  Yeah, wow. 
[03:05:00]  This is what it sounds like.  I got three minutes to fill.  I don't want to talk about that.  Yeah, don't talk about that.  You know, people died on the expressway.  Oh, that was crazy.  Two died in multiple car accidents.  It was really terrible.  I guess somebody came across the median and slammed that.  Let's help out the show for three minutes.  Oh, okay.  Here, hold on a minute.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, what do you need?  Hey, I don't know if we may or may not know this,  but Hopey and Anthony don't need no help on beating up Andrew Dice Clay. 
[03:05:30]  Well, with Andrew, actually, on the phone, they do.  That's what they would want.  You don't understand.  Okay.  Maybe.  I just...  Well, they're listening for a reason.  You understand?  Put it this way.  If you and I were friends, you hear me?  Yes, sir.  If you and I were friends and you had a radio show and I had a radio show  and you were interviewing someone I was pissed off at,  I would want you to be mean to that person. 
[03:06:00]  See what I'm saying?  I understand, yep.  That's what it's all about.  I didn't know if you may or may not have known that they have lambasted the guy.  Well, I figured.  I don't know because I don't get a chance to listen.  They lambasted him, but I know that.  He's not on the air with them.  But he's not there.  What's going on with them?  Right.  Right.  Because he knows he's going to be crushed.  Right.  See what I'm saying?  And I agree with that.  Like I said, it's none of my business.  This is the bleeding heart, you know, liberal guy.  Oh, are you trying to...  Bro, I'm right with you.  So you're trying to say I shouldn't be mean?  All right, we're ready.  I got to go. 
[03:06:30]  Hey, Dice.  Bro, the wheeze.  What's going on, Dice?  It's been a long time.  You don't remember the wheeze?  Yes, I do.  Come on.  We spoke a long time ago.  As a matter of fact, aren't you friends with...  Who are you friends with?  Mancow?  No, I don't like the mancow.  I'm best friends with Opie.  Oh, okay.  And Opie...  I knew it was somebody that I was talking to.  Yeah, I'm best friends with Opie.  Opie worked here with me when he was a young, handsome boy.  And now, of course, they're bigger than the...  They're bigger than the king of all media, baby. 
[03:07:00]  Uh-huh.  Bigger than the king of all media.  And I hear you...  It's good that you're a supporter.  Pardon me?  It's good that you're a supporter.  Supporter ain't the word, man.  I'd do anything for the Opie.  And, you know, Opie called me up and said that he's mad at you.  But, you know what?  Are we here to talk about Opie?  Are we here to talk about my new show?  Pussy.  You know what?  Because if I have a problem with somebody, you know, I go head-to-head with that person,  not with some...  No middle man.  No middle man.  You know what I mean? 
[03:07:30]  No, look at my boy, Bill.  And me and you have a good relationship, so there's no reason for us to get into anything.  I just feel bad...  Remember us talking.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay, listen to me.  All I'm saying, we'll end there.  We'll talk about the show.  Is, you know, I feel bad for the fellas because they helped you out a lot.  Well, I feel I really helped them out a lot.  And, you know, maybe that's something that one day we could talk about.  I hope so.  Hey, does Opie want to chime in?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  Is he on?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  That's what I'm trying to do.  Are you bringing this up?  You know what I mean?  Well, I'll tell you what, Doug.  That's pretty cool.  Hey, Dice.  Dice.  Just before we went on the air with you, I was telling my audience, because I'm a bleeding-heart liberal  and I don't know how to do mean radio.  And I said, I got to try because Opie and the whole story, I just told you what you  know about.  And I said to the audience, I'm not good at this.  I can't mother-hucker people, you know, just to do it.  So that's the deal, like you just said. 
[03:08:30]  But I felt I owed it to Opie.  Well, that's cool.  You're being his friend.  And that's what's important.  That's what I was trying to do.  He doesn't know about friends.  You know, people will read about my problems that I had with them.  Oh, Christ.  You know, obviously you should call me.  Get me on.  Yeah, well, you know what?  Get me on now!  Like a relative to him and a buddy.  I am very close.  You're really heavy on this.  You, like, really feel bad about this. 
[03:09:00]  Well, hold on a second.  What's the matter?  Opie, you there?  Wheeze.  Yeah.  Dice, what is your problem?  I think you lost.  Opie, I think you lost him.  Of course.  Of course we lost him.  Effing pussy.  Did he hang up?  Did he?  Yeah, he ran.  Oh, man.  I gave it a shot.  Opie, the best my liberal ass can do.  You did a good job, man.  It totally shook him up.  And then, yeah, who's the pussy now?  He has nothing against us. 
[03:09:30]  We did nothing but support that guy.  Well, I just think that he's a liar because he said that if he had a problem, he would  go to your face, not a middleman.  And he won't go to your face.  He's got bones and you could get rid of the stupid.  Wait, hold on.  He just did it.  He had a face to face and he hung up.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's the real dice.  There's the real dice.  He's turned his back on all his friends and everyone that has helped him out with no  real good reason.  No good reason whatsoever.  Now, you know, you just made me break a big rule. 
[03:10:00]  What?  What happened?  I'm Jewish.  So, yeah, you guys got to stick together, right?  You made me, did you hear what, oh, did you hear what he said to me that I sound more like  a relative than a friend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said you goddamn right.  I didn't say it that way.  Weez is like a father figure to me, a brother to me, and like one of my best friends in the  whole world.  He covers all those categories.  Let me explain to your audience really fast, Brother Weez.  The only thing Dice has on us, and it's really, really shaky, when we were helping 
[03:10:30]  him get back into Madison Square Garden.  We ended up selling well over 10,000 tickets for Dice.  He needed our show.  We were huge in New York when that was all going on.  We sold 10,000 tickets, even though it was game five of the World Series against the Mets  and the Yankees.  And we pushed, and we pushed, and we pushed, and this was after he sold out two dates at  the Beacon a week earlier, okay?  And he admitted that we were really, really supportive, and we were the reason why.  Responsible for him selling those tickets. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, exactly, okay?  Now, here's the deal.  Also, out of nowhere, Mancow, who we all hate.  He brought him up.  We could all agree, us, Weez, and even Howard Stern, we all hate Mancow.  Out of nowhere, Mancow starts jumping on TV.  He's doing that Fox slot, and he's starting to talk and saying, yeah, I'm bringing Dice  to Madison Square Garden.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm presenting Dice.  You're like, what the?  Wait a minute.  We are.  We're going on every day pushing this thing. 
[03:11:30]  So a day or two before the big show at the Garden, Dice comes in with his kid, and  he says that I was yelling at his kid and stuff.  I wasn't.  I was yelling at Dice, because all of a sudden, he's like, yeah, Mancow's flying down from  Chicago for this big show that I'm doing at the Garden.  I'm like, are you kidding?  Do you understand the relationship we have with Mancow?  That is unacceptable.  Wait, was he putting him on the stage?  He was going to be at the show, meaning he's going to be backstage and all that.  I'm like, look, dude, this is our backyard.  You can't have Mancow come to the show knowing that we don't get along with that guy whatsoever. 
[03:12:00]  Amen.  So it got a little ugly in studio, and his kid just happened to be in the studio.  So now he's spinning it, even though we had a great show at the Garden, ended up having  a great relationship even after I got fired and Ant got fired.  I hung out with him in L.A., went to a gym with him and hung out at his apartment.  He showed me all those tapes that have now become this TV show, by the way, years before  it happened.  Hung out at the club.  We went hiking together.  There was no problems whatsoever.  Somewhere along the line, he got in his head that I disrespected his kid. 
[03:12:30]  You hurt my feelings.  I was very hurt.  It's tender dice now.  He's not funny how he is supposed to find himself so much.  Hey, at least I got a little dice interview here.  Ask some questions.  Yeah, brother wheeze.  Yes, sir.  How's that TV show?  I'm looking forward to it.  Hey, it's great.  You could see me actually on the bottom of the barrel.  This is where I completely sell out, and I turn into a wussy. 
[03:13:00]  I sit there.  I cry.  I put myself out there.  You know, there's a...  I got a poster in my room.  It's of footprints in the sand.  And during the hardest part of my life, there was only one said, and I went, Jesus, where  was you?  And he said, Dice, I'm carrying you.  And I started well enough.  I'm crying here.  Hey, Dice, you're going to be selling out Giants Stadium, right? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, I'm selling out Giants Stadium.  How the hell is that ever going to happen?  During a Giants game.  Right.  I'm going to beat it.  I didn't say who's playing.  Hey, I saw this trailer for that for a minute.  I didn't even know the cat had a show coming on.  That's actually what they're trying to do, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He's telling everyone he's going to sell out Giants Stadium again.  It would be really easy to trash his TV show.  I watched it.  I'm interested in it because I know all the players and stuff. 
[03:14:00]  And I've been in the hotel rooms with Dice when he just babbles all night and stuff.  It's kind of interesting because he makes a thing out of everything.  But this thing with the kid is so ridiculous.  All these guys in this studio right now were there that day.  I didn't disrespect this kid.  We had a real problem with him because out of nowhere, he wanted Man Cow at his Madison  Square Garden show.  But we still did the show.  Matter of fact, there was an empty Madison Square Garden.  We're backstage and he grabs me and goes, come here, come here.  This is such a special day.  I want to remember this moment. 
[03:14:30]  We walked out in the middle of Madison Square Garden when no one was around.  The place is empty.  They're cleaning up.  And we took a photograph together.  He was so happy that we got him back at the Garden.  You could do that now during the Giants Stadium show.  Yeah.  This is what I'm asking you.  Do you think that he seriously believes he's going to sell Giants Stadium?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's delusional.  Yeah, he is pretty delusional.  But he's a backstabber.  One of his old guys works for us now.  He gave 18 years of service.  He ain't going to say anything.  And I understand that.  But 18 years of service.  Dice just blew him off without even an explanation. 
[03:15:00]  That's the type of guy he is.  He's a bridge burner.  And then, you know, the crap he used to say about Howard when he was coming on our show.  But conveniently, he, you know, goes back on Howard's show.  You know, he's lost.  Hey, help me, Jesus.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Who's watching?  I don't even know what network it's on.  VH1.  VH1.  And we just gave you a moment, too, because Dice hung up.  Everyone heard it.  Dice hung up on Weezer's show.  I face the people face to face.  Who's that?  I'll be fine. 
[03:15:30]  That was it.  Because he knows he's right.  He knows, you know, we're right.  He's just trying to, you know, create some kind of drama that is based on nothing.  Well, I mean, he looks so bad.  I mean, maybe he's Howard Stern Jr.  They're both pussies.  Yeah.  I mean, how does a guy hang up when he's got a chance to talk to a guy who he just said  he would go head-to-head with?  Yeah.  Oh, he totally nailed it as far as that's concerned.  Yeah, he said he'd go head-to-head not knowing, oh, it's right there on the phone. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  He gets the opportunity and doesn't go head-to-head.  He's hung up.  Look, I didn't puss out.  There you go.  I was right there to confront him.  And I was going to just ask him, like, what's your problem, Dice, with us?  Explain your problem with us.  No, he's not going to send somebody over to my house for ambushing him, is he?  No.  He went on Howard and said he's going to wait for me outside my apartment and all that.  With flowers.  I'm sorry.  What are you going to sell at Giant Stadium?  Yeah, of course.  I think Dice is going to warm up for Jesus' coffin.  They're going to actually bring the coffin on stage at Giant Stadium. 
[03:16:30]  By the way, I hope you can kick the crap out of that kid.  Out of him?  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  I went on YouTube last night to look at old Dice clips.  Yeah.  I forgot what a bloated fat.  Oh, yeah.  He had on this shirt that said Dice Gym or something, and he's walking around this circular  stage.  With man breasts.  With man breasts.  He's in the bad fashion from the 80s with the pants that are tapered at the ankle.  Really pulling down the camera in the hand.  He's walking around and I go, I have a funny feeling this guy still dresses this way and  walks around this way. 
[03:17:00]  Hey, you know how hard it is to find a bedazzler these days?  To put the studs on my jacket?  They used to sell them all over TV.  I got that.  I got the little pocket fisherman and the bedazzler.  I went to Gold's Gym with Dice in L.A.  I had the worst workout in my entire life.  He all of a sudden throws like 10 pound weights at me and says, all right, curl this.  I'm like, dude, are you looking around this room?  There's animals in here that were just let out of prison and he wants me to do 10 pound 
[03:17:30]  curls and he thinks this is a workout.  I'm like, Dice, let's just go somewhere else.  Do the fellas in the gym get excited when the Dice is in the house?  They kind of all were laughing at him because he wasn't really doing a real workout.  He just walks around.  Is he chubbed up?  He's always been chubbed up, you know?  Yeah, there was a clip we were watching on his show where he goes to the beach and goes  in the water and he waited until the water was up to his neck and then took his shirt  off and threw his shirt at somebody on the beach.  Yeah.  So you couldn't really get a good look. 
[03:18:00]  That's what I used to do when I had the pimples on my back when I was a kid.  Right?  Same thing.  I hear you.  Thanks a million, brother.  Anthony, we love you some.  Hey, thanks, man.  All right, guys.  That was fantastic.  Hey, Wheeze, you're the man, man.  What can I tell you?  All right.  Brother Wheeze, everybody.  Thanks, man.  There they go.  They're on commercial radio, so they probably had a break.  That's not the type of thing Wheeze is comfortable doing about them.  No, no.  Not at all.  That was out of pure, like, friendship and dedication and stuff.  But that shows our relationship. 
[03:18:30]  He'll do anything for me, man.  That guy's great.  And he gave me a career.  Simple as that.  I should be doing things for him.  Let's go to Kevin in Queens.  Kevin, what's up?  Oh.  Hey.  Dude, you're my hero, man.  This is when you shine.  Hello?  That is a shame that bastard hung up, because I would have liked to have seen that.  I got you, Kevin.  I got you.  I'd have loved to have seen that.  Dude, you shine.  Everybody heard it, but I'm sure he'll have some excuses. 
[03:19:00]  You know, his cell phone went out or something, you know.  There you go.  There you go.  Hey, Jimmy.  Can I?  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  I love the Lucky Louie DVD.  I got it, buddy.  And I love you, too.  You're a favorite part of my show.  See you.  Thank you, man.  Glad you enjoyed it.  You're a favorite part of his show?  You're on his show?  Yes, I am.  I do phoners.  Jesus.  I do them from the toilet.  I just hold it and shit diarrhea.  It's Jim Norton's fucking broken rain gutter hour.  I haven't heard it quite put that way. 
[03:19:30]  Broken rain gutter.  Oh, is that horrible?  I've never heard anyone looks more stupid in my life than Dice does now.  We freaking set him up like, look, you know, I deal with my problems face to face.  I'm like, all right, here he is.  Click.  Dude, he was like, how quick did he do that?  That's like you're flying a fighter plane and a light bulb goes out and you eject.  The guy just like fucking bolted the second he heard you. 
[03:20:00]  There you go.  All right, it's that type of attitude that's going to feel, I'm so excited, I can't even  talk to you.  I know.  It's that type of attitude that's going to sell out Giant Stadium, of course.  Yeah.  I'm a tough guy.  That raw energy.  Yeah.  That I take on everybody.  Oh, you're all brave on Howard's show, but when you're faced with us, what do you do?  He's going to wait out in front of you.  What do you do?  Everyone heard it, Dice.  Everybody heard it.  In case.  All right, we're going to play, and you know what?  More people are going to hear it tomorrow.  Cut that up. 
[03:20:30]  There's a few cities that need to hear that tomorrow as well.  Porn Libs next.  The Opie and Anthony Show is bringing back the walkover.  Friday, March 16th, the day before St. Patrick's Day.  Join Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, and the ONA Show crew as they walk from CBS to XM.  Jimmy, wait.  Spring is just around the corner, so what better way to celebrate than walking a block with  a bunch of radio dopes.  That's Friday, March 16th. 
[03:21:00]  Join the walkover from CBS to XM with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Program.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  XM 202.  Let's say hi to John in Rochester. 
[03:21:30]  John, what's up?  Opie, man.  That was some of the greatest radio I've heard in years.  I'm from Rochester.  I've been listening to the Wees since I was just a baby.  I've been listening to you guys for a bunch of years, and I've been waiting for the day  that you get the Wees on the show with you.  Today, not only do you do that, but you get the tag team against the Dice.  It was poetic, brother.  We get Wees on from time to time.  We had him doing a show on 202 every once in a while, but his company said, no, he can't  do it anymore, even though he was doing it for free.  Nah.  It's ridiculous. 
[03:22:00]  It's too bad.  Completely ridiculous.  That is.  And we work for the same company, technically.  When we're on regular radio, we're on one of the stations in Rochester that owns Brother  Wees' station.  Yeah.  So, he got in a lot of trouble the last time he came down here and did his show for 202.  Mm-hmm.  But he's the man.  He hates that type of radio, by the way.  Oh, it's not him.  Yeah.  He doesn't do that.  He prides himself in being a liberal and everyone should get along and all that crap.  But he's a loyal friend.  He is as loyal as they come.  Absolutely.  What Opie did is why we listen. 
[03:22:30]  What happened?  Scott in Minnesota.  Scott.  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  Everybody is cool.  Everybody does their job there, but that is why I listen right there.  Because you and making the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  That is just awesome.  I was just saying it was great hearing crazy Opie yelling into the mic, put me on!  Absolutely.  That is why I keep listening.  If I told you how many hours I spent on the phone with Dice after we got fired, every 
[03:23:00]  time I was out in L.A., we hung out, and then out of nowhere, like he's done, it's his  history.  He just turns his back on us because I guess he didn't need us anymore or whatever.  Whatever.  I get that.  But don't bullshit with everyone.  Why don't you tell it like it is?  We never had a real friendship.  You were just using us to sell out Madison Square Garden and getting your name up there  again.  Yeah.  I got to hear the clip now because I was in the moment.  I got to hear it.  We're going to find it. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy.  Opie, the reason I pay for my XM is for moments that I bow to you, sir.  Bravo.  Punching out.  I really think that's just the beginning, by the way.  Are you out of here, Jeremy?  I have to do it.  Yeah, we got a flight.  I got to finish packing and he's going to be in my house.  You're flying?  Yes, to Pittsburgh.  Let me see how you're going to flap your arm.  I can't do it for real.  I'll do it later.  No, it was great, dude.  It was great, dude.  That was the perfect setup, too.  We used to go, and it's like, good for you, but I don't do it this way.  When I have a problem, I go face to face.  And he goes, all right. 
[03:24:00]  Okay, here's face to face.  Click, hello.  Guys, hello.  It was perfect.  Like, it was timing like that happens in comedy.  Right.  You don't.  He just hung up.  That was like the funniest thing he's done in years.  He couldn't have said anything worse than what he did.  What he did.  Or not say, whatever.  No, no, no.  I do face to face.  Face to face.  No middleman.  Okay, here he is.  No, yeah, no middleman.  Okay, here he is.  You and him.  Click. 
[03:24:30]  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, it'll be fun to see how he spins that one.  Let's go to Chris in South Carolina.  Chris.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I was just listening to that clip.  What a puss, man.  I mean, good God.  You put him face to face and he hangs up.  What a puss.  Hey, look here, man.  I got a guy that works in a printing production, man.  I just called him.  He's a big listener.  He couldn't call you guys because, of course, he was working.  But we're making about 1,000 bumper stickers right now. 
[03:25:00]  Down with dice.  And they're going to be handed out all the way to St. Augustine, Florida, this weekend.  So, down with dice.  Fuck him.  Frunkus.  All right, thanks.  Frunkus.  We're losing Jimmy.  All right.  And club soda Kenny goes with him.  Kenny, he's meeting me because my girlfriend's probably sleeping nude so I can't bring him upstairs.  Oh.  Yeah, because she sleeps like that.  Nude.  Does she live with you?  No.  Totally nude.  Completely nude.  Nice call back.  She wears either a blue or red bandana depending on which gang she wants to be. 
[03:25:30]  Just on her head.  All right, listen.  I'll see you guys on Monday.  Safe trip, Jimmy.  Break a gam.  Pittsburgh Improv.  All weekend long.  Starting tonight?  Yeah, tonight.  I've got to go do some TV.  Could you check in with us tomorrow?  We're going to miss you.  Yeah, I'll be up, actually.  I'm not doing local radio.  I'm just doing afternoon radio.  I'm doing morning stuff in Pittsburgh.  You've got the hotline, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Say hi to the gang at K-Roll.  Let us know everything's okay.  All right.  Give us a little call.  Bye, guys.  Wait, that means you can't play Porn Libs with us.  No.  I can't.  But you're perfect for this game. 
[03:26:00]  Oh.  He'd probably be a ringer.  I got the first one, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  You want to play with us?  Yeah, well, I'll do one.  Because, again, the dice thing, I queued up.  Oh, I'll do it.  All right.  All right.  Here's the first one again.  It's Porn Libs, Danny's new game.  But there's two.  You have this.  Okay.  Let me play the original clip again.  So there's some bleeps.  So you've got to figure out what the bleeps are.  Okay?  When I give you a command, you better move faster, you fucking slut.  I'm going to f*** your f*** if you don't listen to me.  You need to be trained, you worthless f***. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  So just in case you didn't hear it, when I give you a command, you better move faster,  you fucking slut.  I'm going to eh in your eh if you don't listen to me.  You need to be trained, you worthless eh.  Um, you're going to shave in your kitchen sink.  Oh, that's a good one.  You worthless homemaker.  I'm not even going to guess now, because Jimmy's got it.  You know what it's got to be. 
[03:27:00]  Can you see it?  Come in your face, you worthless whore.  I thought, I'm going to f*** your ass.  How about, I'm going to come in your children.  I say, I'm going to f*** your ass, you worthless piece of s***.  Well, is it in your?  Yeah.  I'm going to f*** your ass.  I'm going to go with s***, mouth, and then the N-word.  Whoa.  I'm going to s*** in your mouth, you worthless n***er.  Moss.  I'm going to f*** you in the s***. 
[03:27:30]  No, it's one bleep, so I'm going to.  It's a beep.  Blank in your blank.  Come in your face.  I'm going to f*** your beep.  Oh, I'm going to.  Is it beep?  If it's beep, it's f*** your ass.  It says, I'm going to blank in your blank.  Is it in your?  Yes.  I'm going to come in your mouth.  Or come in your.  Yeah, come in your mouth.  Now you've got to play it again.  All right.  Sorry.  Damn it.  And then there's a long bleep at the end.  All right.  When I give you a command, you better move faster, you f***ing s***er.  I'm going to f*** your s***er if you don't listen to me. 
[03:28:00]  You need to be trained, you worthless s***er.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Worthless, uh.  Worthless.  Cum drinker?  Well, you used the word s***er, Eddie, so.  All right.  Well, I do my fill-ins face to face.  I'm going to c***.  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  I'm going to come in your mouth, you worthless piece of s***.  You worthless cum.  No, I'm going to come in your mouth, you worthless cum sl***er cum drinker.  Mm-hmm.  I would say you worthless cum drunk dick monger. 
[03:28:30]  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  That was only during your positive affirmations into the mirror, would you say that?  Long way to go for not much.  Here we go.  My fault.  Here's the answer.  I'm going to blank in your blank.  Everyone's got.  Well, come in your.  Then again, it could be.  How talk about the answers?  I think come in your mouth.  I think it's.  Come in your.  I think the word s*** is going to be involved.  I think you worthless piece of s***.  No.  No.  No.  Because it was a long bleep.  Yeah, but.  But he would have.  Piece of.  Would have also been bleeped. 
[03:29:00]  Because you would have known it was s***.  I'm going to go.  So he would have bleeped piece of s***.  I'm going to go with cum guzzler.  Yeah, cum drinker.  Because we would have left you worthless piece of beep.  You would have known it was s***.  So he had to bleep the whole thing.  Yeah.  So it's just a piece of cake.  I think.  When I give you a command, you better move faster.  You f***ing s***.  I'm going to s*** in your mouth if you don't listen to me.  You need to be trained, you worthless piece of dog doo doo.  Oh, I got two out of doo doo.

Fucking asshole.  It's just a funny bit, and he pulled it off so badly.  Maybe he didn't have arms he didn't hang up with.  You know, Dice, he's not going to live that one down anytime soon, man.  That was the worst thing he could have done.  You want to try another one, Jimmy?  All right, I'll do one more quick one.  All right, here's Porn Libs from Danny.

Oh, boy.  I want to hear the whole thing.  It's more complicated.  Oh, boy.  I'll tell you why I can't do it.  The backup, the XM backup that I'm pulling from crapped out, so there would be a huge chunk  of a little dead air.  I don't think I'm playing poker tonight, Danny.  Yeah.  Hey, tell XM to get better crap.  Pan.  Yeah, well, pan.  All right, let's hear what you got there. 
[03:34:30]  I'm playing poker tonight.  Oh, Christ.  You know, obviously you should call that.  Get me on.  Well, you know what?  Get me on now.  Like a relative to him and a buddy.  I am very close.  You're heavy on this.  You, like, really feel bad about this.  Well, hold on a second.  What's the matter?  Oh, you there?  Wheeze.  Yeah.  Dice, what is your problem?  I think you lost.  Oh, I think you lost him.  Of course, of course we lost him. 
[03:35:00]  Effin' pussy.  Did he hang up?  Did he?  Yeah, he ran.  Oh, man.  Can you believe that?  There you go.  In case you missed it.  It was that quick.  Yeah.  I was like, Dice, what's your problem?  It was all Brave and Howard show.  He got a whole laundry list of problems, and then you asked him.  You didn't even bet.  It wasn't even like, hey, you ass, or something like that.  It was like, Dice, what's your problem?  Yeah.  Here you go.  Just lay it out right now.  Let's start with the basics.  Click.  Because he doesn't even know.  And he said, it'll all be in my book.  It'll all be in my book. 
[03:35:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Wait for the lawsuit.  I'll tell you right now.  Wait for the lawsuit.  Oh, nice.  We got audio tapes of his appearance.  Go Jew on him.  If he's claiming that we did something that didn't happen, we're going to have fun with  him.  Did you say go Jew on him?  Yeah.  Are we lost?  Are we lost?  No, but the Jews involved.  With the lawyer?  Yeah.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  That's who you want as your lawyer.  Sick your Jew on him.  That's what I say.  We have to break before line of the day, or?  No.  We can't do it right now. 
[03:36:00]  I love Jews.  I live amongst them.  No, you don't have to love them.  I don't give a shit.  I do.  I love Jews.  Live amongst them.  Yeah.  I love Jews.  I'm sitting right in front of a swastika you drew.  You know who drew that?  Patrice O'Neill.  Really?  He sat there and doodled a swastika, and it's been on that folder ever since.  And every time I come here, it just reminds me.  Sitting there.  All right.  We're going to end the show next.  Rich Voss is at...  Poughkeepsie Bananas.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Yeah, yeah.  Poughkeepsie.  Quick break.  Line of the day.  The township of bananas. 
[03:36:30]  And Steve from Bayshore is requesting his My Age song for Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do that as well.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hi, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt.  Hey, folks.  My name is Henry Rowland.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong, and you're listening to Pot Talk.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss, and you're listening to OPNM.  I love this.  Please refrain from the word cunt.  All right.  We're going to do Line of the Day and get out of here.  It's going to get interesting from here on in. 
[03:37:00]  That'll be fun.  Oh, man.  Where did my note from Bob Saget go?  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This is going to...  Oh, is this going to be bad if you can't find it?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Eh, whatever.  Okay.  Fuck Bob Saget.  No.  No, it's going to be dude.  Hey, Bob.  I hope he's doing it.  Nah, he knows we love him.  Hey, Line of the Day brought to you by BodogFight.com. 
[03:37:30]  Tune in to ION TV Tuesdays and Saturdays for episodes of Bodog Fights.  For all mixed martial arts action you could want, check out BodogFight.com.  We got the runner-up line of the day right here.  They're not smart enough to make the obvious joke.  They're going to talk about a country that doesn't like tipping.  My God.  Have some fun with it.  Israel and the continent of Africa.  Very good.  Very early on.  Yes. 
[03:38:00]  That's what...  Nah, whatever.  Let's have a replay.  Jesus.  The replay starts in four hours, whatever it is.  Love of God.  Or next, depending on what time you're listening to this particular audio.  Or it's actually, yeah.  Or it's going to start right up again.  Or you're listening to the replay and it's just about over.  But then the replay starts again.  And then that's where we talk about John and Jack.  Yeah, but you might have heard it already.  But if you're listening live right now, then Rana Fez are next and that screws it all up.  Yeah, because then we'd say it again, but Rana Fez wouldn't be next. 
[03:38:30]  Right.  It would be us coming on again.  Right.  Hmm.  So we can't even say that...  If we say you're not going to hear next, that's not necessarily true.  Because next, at this particular time, is Rana Fez.  Yeah.  But if they're hearing this around...  Oh, don't give a time.  That just screws up.  Now, whatever.  Bodogfight.com.  Go there.  Check them out.  This is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:39:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Is this idiot saying Sherlock Holmes?  Yeah.  What is he, retarded?  Yes.  Oh, Holmes.  What's the big deal?  The big deal?  The big deal.  Sherlock Holmes.  There's an S, stupid.  Bono!  Ah!  Bono!  And there you have it.  Sherlock Holmes. 
[03:39:30]  And then he hands me a card from the Sherlock Holmes Museum that he crossed out Sherlock Holmes  and put his own name in.  He goes, here's my card.  It's my business card.  So he actually had it written down where you could see it says Sherlock Holmes.  And you got the faggity wallet.  Oh, my God.  What is that thing?  Oh, God.  It matches his fag bag.  That is...  What the fuck?  I was almost accepting the bag, but I can't accept that.  The Louis Vuitton shill.  I can't accept that wallet.  It's a wallet. 
[03:40:00]  It looks all flowery.  It's not.  It's a nice little...  It's awful.  You know what?  I'm too beaten down.  That's all right.  No one will see it.  He's Jewish.  That's the new line of the day.  All right.  Steve from Bayshore has been requesting his own song, which is fine.  I don't mean to beat up Steve.  It is very, very good.  We have it right here?  All right.  We're going to leave you guys with this today. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Steve does a great job at singing like Elvis.  It's unbelievable.  You can listen to it as like a regular song.  He should just re-record Elvis' songs.  Well, we're doing late...  It's not even going to be late night.  It's going to be St. Paddy's Day karaoke at the joint.  FH Riley's, my bro's restaurant.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  A week from Saturday, we're all going to be there.  Maybe Steve will sing this little ditty.  Yeah.  And then my brother, he emailed earlier.  He's saying he's got a new Bubba is a Cunt song he wants to debut.  Debut it. 
[03:41:00]  I'm like, how do you make that song better?  He's looking for a...  Well, it's like when...  Who does that?  Chubby Checker did the twist.  And then he did the twist again like we did last summer.  And then twisting on the boardwalk and twisting...  He just had one common theme running through everything.  I just figured it out.  Why?  I'm just so stupid.  What?  It's probably...  I wish I could call him...  It's going to be a Dice song.  Ah.  My brother takes this stuff very seriously.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, we talk about it every once in a while, but he was the one that was looking up flights 
[03:41:30]  to go to Chicago to beat up Man Cow.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, hmm.  Well, no, that reservation doesn't work, man.  Man, I have to throw this dick a beating at noon and...  A middle seat?  A middle seat?  Oh, fuck.  His beating's going to have to wait.  Because Man Cow just, like, said some horrific things about me personally, and he's never  met me.  And that just put my brother over the edge.  Wally Ducey punched him in the face. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Here we go.  This is Steve from Bayshore.  Thanks, guys.  Voss, Bananas, Poughkeepsie.  Thanks, man.  Tomorrow and Saturday, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  My Aids.  Right up.  Steve from Bayshore.  Right.  About Lil' Jimmy Norton.  Oh.  Now, this next song was recorded by Lil' Jimmy Norton, and it's called, uh, uh...  My Aids.  My Aids.  I don't know the words to accept your ears.  You know my...  And now the hiv is near, and so I face the viral hurt. 
[03:42:30]  My friend, I'm not a queer.  I love those girls with thick meat curtains.  I've lived life as a fool.  I've traveled down that Hershey Highway. 
[03:43:00]  I'm sure it's things like this that gave me my...  My Aids.  Oh, pets.  I've banged a few.  But then again,  most of them female.  I've paid  for sex with youths  And one or two large organ she-mails. 
[03:43:30]  My glands feel scraped and coarse.  My little lungs are clogged with mucus robed up.  Like Robert Reed, I think it's my Aids.  I've had some times  More than a few 
[03:44:00]  When I bit off  Oh, number two  But screw it all  But screw it all  When you're in spouts  I suck it up  I suck it up  Yeah, and eat a ride  These saws ain't small  They're on my balls  Claim it on my Aids  I've loved 
[03:44:30]  In bareback style  I've had my ass  Filled with four fingers  And now  It's no surprise  That not one tea  Cell ever lingers  To think  I slept with that  Toothless crack bone  Way up  Way up in Harlem 
[03:45:00]  At first  Just HIV  And now it's my Aids  For how can a man  Born with no chin  Eat broth each meal  He'll grow too thin  I start to sweat  My skin might scorch  It started off  Under that porch 
[03:45:30]  It don't look good  For little Jim  How I hate my Aids  I should've not  French kissed that Jim  Now I've got my Aids  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show 
[03:46:00]  Greg O.P. Hughes  Holy crap  My brain just exploded  Anthony Kuhlman  Wrong idiot  Bullshit  James J. Norton  Give me those ribs, you  Waka waka  You stay away from me, Jim Norton  Martini Steve  Cozy Lebanese  E-Rock  E-Rock radio  Shut up, Eric  Right, Robin?
