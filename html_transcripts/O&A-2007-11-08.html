<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to another in a chaotic and often vulgar manner.  The show began with a discussion of a toy recall, ultimately revealed to be a "Haitian Barbie," followed by commentary on Paul McCartney's new relationship and a humorous New York Post cartoon.  This transitioned into a protracted and contentious debate surrounding "Phone Call Thursday," which Opie repeatedly derisively referred to as "Dummy Thursday," leading to many callers simply stating "Phone Call Thursday" without further contribution.  A caller, Rich, sparked a discussion about Robert Moses' allegedly racist design of Long Island's parkways, prompting debate about driving etiquette.  The hosts then launched into a lengthy, humorous rant about manatees.  A caller identified a creature shown on CNN as a frilled shark.

A substantial portion of the show focused on Dog the Bounty Hunter's apology tour following his use of a racial slur.  The hosts played numerous audio clips of Dog's apologies, including his bizarre desire to be buried in a slave graveyard, and discussed a CNN listener poll regarding his continued presence on television.  This segment concluded with Opie and Anthony negotiating the end of "Phone Call Thursday," replacing it with the unwelcome "Talk Like Tim Thursday," which proved disastrous, met with overwhelmingly negative listener feedback.  The show also included listener calls expressing dislike for "Talk Like Tim Thursday" and a humorous misunderstanding by a caller named Annette regarding a sound-of-the-day segment.  In-studio guests included Sam (to introduce an Angry Vince clip), Adam Ferrara (from *Rescue Me*), and Rob Bartlett.

A significant portion featured Angry Vince's rant against Shawn Michaels, focusing on Michaels’ born-again Christianity and alleged hypocrisy.  The hosts discussed TMZ's portrayal of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and Rob Bartlett’s upcoming appearance on the Don Imus show.  The Aquadots toy recall, due to a chemical mimicking a date-rape drug, and concerns over manufacturing standards in China were also covered.  A funny flight attendant announcement and the lack of security at New Jersey shipping yards were discussed.  Rob Bartlett discussed being fired from the Don Imus show before its return and his experiences with Bernie Getz.  The segment ended with promotion of upcoming Opie and Anthony live shows.

Further segments with Rob Bartlett as a guest included repeated comedic pronouncements of "linger longer," a caller's bizarre story about seeing people cooking what appeared to be dog in a container yard, and more discussion of Bartlett's appearance on the Imus show. Damon Wayans' defense of Imus on *The View*, particularly his controversial statement that women should just cook, was discussed with vulgar and misogynistic commentary, and the hosts mocked the *View* panelists' responses.  Women's college basketball was disparaged.  A caller, Bill, challenged this stance, and the conversation shifted to a hypothetical one-on-one basketball game.  Audio clips of Damon Wayans’ comments were played, followed by graphic discussion and commentary of the video "Two Girls One Cup," including detailed descriptions and explicit reactions from Adam Ferrara.  The segment ended with a story about a drug deal gone wrong involving torture and explicit descriptions.

A chaotic final segment included angry listener calls, and teasing of a bit called "Marco Eats the Peach," detailing graphic sexual acts for NSYNC concert tickets, with explicit descriptions.  This segued into promoting upcoming stand-up shows.  A caller, Tim, claimed to have heard the bit on XM radio's E-Rock, leading to further discussion of the bit's various versions. The conversation continued with graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  A listener-submitted slideshow detailing graphic depictions of men engaging in sexual acts and crack cocaine use was described in explicit detail with offensive language.  A discussion of the song "Lemon Party," described as featuring naked elderly people and a lemon, followed.  A news story about a teacher forcing a child to drink urine was also covered.  The segment included more listener calls and mocked tech support calls.  Finally, a female guest, Julie, was introduced, and the conversation devolved into highly suggestive and sexually charged humor with numerous explicit comments and jokes, including attempts to get Julie to say sexually suggestive phrases in Portuguese. The show concluded with further promotion of upcoming shows, vulgar remarks, and an abrupt end.

[00:11:30]  Lady McCartney  Outside on the deck  Guess the rate there's  Trimax chewing on your leg  Tuesday afternoon 
[00:12:00]  She's looking sexy  Then I lift her skirt  And see that stump  Close my eyes  And fantasize while effing  She has her stuff  Lady McCartney  Or should I say  Eileen  How you gonna curse you  When you meet the queen  Fan favorite 
[00:12:30]  Brother Joe  Anthony's brother  With a fine little ditty  About Heather Mills  Stump, stump, stump, stump  Yeah, let's say hi to Rich  He's already enraged  Not to be confused with  A strange  Strange  He's enraged  Enraged  Hey Rich, what's up?  Westchester, what are you doing?  Happen  What's going on guys?  Linger Longer, Jimmy, Anthony O  Hello  I'm Rick  Right now  You're what?  I'm raging  You're boiling 
[00:13:00]  You're already road raging?  I wish I had a roll of quarters  To fling out my sunroof  And be in the trunk  Well, what's going on out there on the roadway?  It's six o'clock in the morning  I'm yawning, drinking my coffee  Trying to merge onto the Bronx River Parkway  What is it, construction?  Is it cones up or what?  What do we got?  Not at all, gentlemen  It's the smallest merge ever  And it makes it bad enough  I pull out  Lincoln Navigator's on my left 
[00:13:30]  No courtesy  Blinker I put on  Flashes me  Gets on the gas  And I'm basically in the dirt  I gotta  Alright  I have a huge problem with this  I grew up on Long Island  The parkways on Long Island  Built many, many years ago  By a man named Robert Moses  Robert Moses stinks  Well, he built the parkway system 
[00:14:00]  Why don't you tell the fine folks in America  That he was an uber racist  He was an uber racist  Because he built the parkway systems  On Long Island  To get to the parks  That are on Long Island  The beaches  Long Island was known for their parks  And their beaches  Back in the day  So what he decided to do  Was to make the bridges  The overpasses  The overpasses  Over the parkways  Really low  So no inner city buses  Could get down the parkways 
[00:14:30]  And ship in black people  To the wonderful white beaches  Wow  Of Long Island  Well, this has been accused  Over the years  Oh, and why?  Of course it's true  Maybe he was sending limos for people  Yes, that's what he was doing  To this day  It's kind of weird  I don't know if there's many roadways in America  That actually have  Like parkways  Where you can't have commercial vehicles on it  Yeah, yeah  This is just  No commercial vehicles allowed  The reason is  Because you can't get under these overpasses  Because they're too short 
[00:15:00]  Every so often  A tractor trailer from out of state  Decides to get on there  Makes a mistake  And whammo  The whole top of their truck  Is just gone  And then they gotta let the air out of their tires  To get under the overpass  Because the overpasses have an arch to them  Very big arch  So the middle is maybe 13 feet high  And the edges are about 8 feet high  Yeah  So if you're in the right lane  You're just slamming the whole side of your truck off  Right  But the parkways were built at a time 
[00:15:30]  Where there wasn't a lot of traffic  So the on-ramps are very short  And you have to adapt  And learn how to use  The segment of road  Before you even hit the on-ramp  Now I understand there's a curve sometimes to that  This means you have to  Cut the apex  And gas it  Gas it  And get up to highway speed  Before you even see  What you have to merge into  And then you can adjust accordingly  Either go faster 
[00:16:00]  And get in front  Or slow down a bit  And get behind  But my worst  The thing I want to get out of my car  And punch someone in the face  Is when I see someone sitting at the end  Of an acceleration lane  At the very end  Brakes on  Head out the window  Looking backwards  Like  I completely screwed this move up  I couldn't merge  I ran out of road  And now I got to go from 0 to 70  Hoping not to get rear-ended 
[00:16:30]  Those kill me  And when I get behind people  And I see one  Glimmer  Of a brake light  On an on-ramp  Or acceleration lane  I go nuts  I yell  I yell  I go  Why the brakes?  Why?  There's no reason for brakes  No reason for brakes?  Not there  Not at all  As a matter of fact  Just throw the pedal away  Hacksaw it off  Rich  I don't know 
[00:17:00]  The entire circumstance  But  I'm not very sympathetic  I gotta tell you  That the hate  Is lingering much longer  Than I anticipated here  I'm not a light  Yeah  And I'll pull up behind him  Alright  Well hang in there Rich  We'll try to make you laugh  As you're in hell there  Okay  You guys are the best  Alright Rich  Rich from Westchester everyone  Hey  We're gonna give away  Another thousand dollars  Not now though  A lot of people are calling  We got Scott in Wisconsin  Scott why are you calling? 
[00:17:30]  Uh  It's just Thursday  Anthony  Why do you hate  Phone Call Thursday so much?  I love Dummy Thursday  No  It's Phone Call Thursday  I dub it  Dummy Thursday  It's just Phone Call Thursday  Hey uh  Ken  Boston  What's up?  Ken  Dummy from Boston  What's up?  Hey guys  How you doing today?  Hey Jimmy  Hey buddy  What's up Ken?  Hey why are you calling?  Cause it's Phone Call Thursday  You gotta love it  Cause it's Dummy Thursday  Ken had nothing to say  He had no creative thoughts 
[00:18:00]  Why not let the regular man  Or a woman  Call the show  One lousy day a week  Why do they have to  Sit there in their car  And try to think of  Something creative  This early in the morning  Why can't they  Why can't they just  Call us and say hi  I welcome their calls  Here on  Douche Thursday  It is Phone Call Thursday  And speaking of Boston  Ken  F the manatees  F them I say  I'm done with Jane Seymour  Now I say  F the manatees  That's what I do  They do a little column 
[00:18:30]  In the Herald I think  They stink  Propeller marks on their back  Gotta roll their fat bodies around  Little known fact  When I was living in Boston  One of those things  Tried to hit on me  One of those things  Maybe that's why  They write nasty stuff about us  Cause I  What is it when you like  Their advances  You  Their advances  They were rebutted  Oh  Rebut  No  What is it  Shunned 
[00:19:00]  Rejected  You shunned their advances  One of those  Spurned  They were spurned  One of those  Iraq puts a manatee up  Oh are they disgusting animals  They really are  Why try to save these stupid looking  Swimming tick  It's a swimming tick  Look at how small the head is  The little stupid head  When the manatee  Bob Kelly body  Little hands  When the manatee is going  From the bottom of the tank  To the top  It has just the tiniest head  And it looks like  Yeah  A tick filled with blood 
[00:19:30]  It's a big engorged tick  And it's arms are hanging  Yeah  They can't even clap  Or give you the finger  Two fat arms hanging  Can't do nothing with these  This is  This is why  This is why  God sucks  Oh yeah  I said it  Wow  Mad man  We don't get dinosaurs  Roaming around  We get these things  How do these things  Like survive evolution  You want dinosaurs  Just roaming around  How cool would that be  How cool would that be  Would they be roaming  Is it pot talk Thursday

[00:20:30]  To see them  All over the place  You'd be rebuilding  Stuff all the time  All the time  They're just constantly  Gnawing on the side  Of a building  Or something  But they would know  Better because we  Would tase the hell  Out of them  And they would behave  But every once in a while  Because they're just  Big and clunky  They're going to  Knock down a building  Can you just kill them  Or are they like  Endangered  Endangered  You just tase them a lot  But they're walking around  Yeah  In the city  Actually I want  One of those  Pterodactyls  You want like  A pterodactyl  Yeah with a huge wingspan  Just like  Look out the window  And say  Oh wow  Look at that  A pterodactyl 
[00:21:00]  To fly around  And then  Who's the lucky car  That has to like  Wash off the  I know it's hacked  But the windshield  Because that would happen  Like  It would happen  Like elephant dung  On your windshield  It would just be  You'd be out of washer fluid  Yeah  It still wouldn't work  Look like somebody  Whitewashed your car  But you ever think of that  Seriously  You don't think stupid stuff  Like we don't get  I all the time think that  We don't get dinosaurs  But we get manatees  What the hell are they good for  Except getting in the way  Of your boat  You ever

[00:24:00]  And the manatees sit there  With their mouths open  Trying to receive the water  That's coming out of the plant  That's going back  Into the river  Oh good  The toxic water  If that tells the show  How stupid they are  Aren't they idiots  That's the beauty  Of human nature though  We're trying to save  The manatees  As we pump  Like  Freaking waste  Toxic waste  You gotta go  10 miles an hour  Because they're  Preserving the manatees  As right there  They're trying to  Like drink sewage water  Pumping foamy water

[00:28:30]  And the phone number is  877-212-ON-A  Quick break  We'll be back  Opie and Anthony  Good morning Buffalo  Hey  And good morning  Syracuse  And good afternoon Cleveland  And good sort of afternoon  To Washington D.C.  They got us on  In a real weird time  Good mid morning  Good mid morning  To ya  Mid morning 
[00:29:00]  877-212-ON-A  Let's say hi to  Michael  He's a black dude  From the Bronx  Michael what's up  That was a lot  Of commercials dude  Yeah it was kind of  Was it  It seemed a little long  It seemed a little long  Today didn't it  Yeah  Yeah radio's got to  Figure out another way  Man because you know  We live in a different  A different age here  With entertainment  Yep  I was thinking about  That the other day  You know we watch TV  Now completely different  We all DVR our butts off 
[00:29:30]  Because we don't want  To sit through commercials  Fast forward  And it's time radio  Figures something out  That's a little different  We like our advertisers  I'm just wondering  If there's a better way  To do it  Yeah you buy box sets  Of your favorite TV shows  And then just throw them in  Right  You download your favorite shows  Off iTunes  And now like a lot of  The network websites  You can just download  Their shows  And watch whenever you want  Yeah  So they got to figure  Something out here  I don't know  What do you think  Like sponsored hours 
[00:30:00]  Something  Well like the old days  Where you do your own commercials  Like live reads  But they're all live reads  Done when you don't see it coming  Right  Like oldie time  Yeah  And remember  Use chia soap  And then just keep going  Get the blood out  When she's been lippy  Let's go to Michael again  Hey Michael  So what do you got  Thank you for waiting  Through the long commercial  I want to sign that position  So a dog can kill himself  I'll accept his apology 
[00:30:30]  Oh yeah you know what  We're not going to let that drop today  Michael hold on  I'm going to play the clip again  This was the dog on  Hannity and Combs  The other night  On what show?  Hannity  And Combs  Combs  No that's not it  This is it  Of course all black people  In America  I owe an apology to  Whether  How dark I think I am  I cannot say that word  How dark  What  I owe the rest of the people  Whether they're black or not  In America  An apology  Because people look up to me 
[00:31:00]  I don't  I've learned a lesson  All my lessons I've learned in my life  Have been the hard way  I guess I wouldn't learn them  This is one of the hardest lessons  I've ever learned in my life  Even facing death  If I could kill myself  And people would forgive me  I would do that  I said on the way here  I hope no one died  Thinking I meant that word  Before I got here  This guy's insane  He doesn't care if people die  But please do it after  He apologizes  That's right 
[00:31:30]  So they can go to their deathbed  Knowing that dog  Is indeed sorry  This should be his new reality show  Just go on every single radio and TV show out there  And just babble  And apologize  I can listen to this guy babble  And who really looked up to the dog  Seriously  I would take a peek here once in a while  And go wow  That guy seems a little off  I think you could probably go to a few states  In the country that looked up to him  Actually looked up to him  Yeah  Yeah  For what reason  Because they probably wanted to  Like be him 
[00:32:00]  Think about it  Think about it  I know where you're going but  Yeah  I don't know if that means  You would look up to this guy  He's  Probably  Like you know  Look and go  Damn  I won't be a bounty hunter  Do you look up to him  Yes  I do  I didn't think I ever would  Until a few days ago  Michael  So what Michael's getting at  We didn't forget what he said yesterday  We played it on this show  So we're encouraging our black brothers 
[00:32:30]  That listen to this fine radio show  To call up and say  You would forgive him  If he killed himself  And he really stressed that  When he got to that part of the apology  He goes  If it would help  I would kill myself  Like it wasn't like  Just a little throwaway  He was very dramatic  In that part of the apology  Alright Michael  We'll add you to the list  Alright hang on  I would  I would only accept his apology  If he puts himself  Knowingly into a saw trap  Oh  What's a saw trap? 
[00:33:00]  Saw trap  What's a saw trap?  It has to rip off the hair on his head  From his scalp  All the way back  Alright on man  Alright Michael  Thank you  I think one of the listeners  Is trying to get a website up  So you know  A little petition  Because I think if we get enough black people  But actually  You were right yesterday  He's saying  It doesn't matter if you're black or white  Yeah  He would kill himself  If that meant you would forgive him  Yeah  And he was saying  He wants forgiveness from everybody  So  Right 
[00:33:30]  Yeah  And you know what  Before we play the brand new clips  From Larry King  Which weren't as good as  The clips from Hannity and Combs  Because I think some of his people  Got to him and said  Look you look like a complete ass  On Hannity and Combs  Yeah somebody had to have gotten to him  Why don't you shut the F up  And keep it very basic  You idiot  But from Hannity and Combs  I can't get enough of this clip  How he wants to be buried with the slaves  One more time for everybody  One more time  He said no dog  He said  Oh by the way this is  Yeah he went to  What George Washington's house  And saw like a slave graveyard 
[00:34:00]  But they had to tell him it was that  Because it was a blank hill  Yes  He said blank hill  Blank hill they call it  No grave markers  And well this is what he had to say  After seeing the slave graveyard  At George Washington's house  He said no dog  He said  The black people back then  When they died  They wanted their feet buried  Towards the Potomac  So they could walk over the river  When they passed away  Back to Africa  And I thought  Oh my God  There's not a marker in there 
[00:34:30]  I told the Lord  And two Catholic ladies  Own that property  So I've already made phone calls  I'm going to be buried  Right in that center  You've made a deal to do that?  I'm making a deal  She told me dog  Absolutely  Because I will never be forgiven  As I'm alive  And you and I know that  But they'll be able to say  Forever and ever  Dog is sorry  They'll come someday  To their children  Will come to their say  Why is dog buried there? 
[00:35:00]  Why is that white man lay there?  And they'll be able to say  Because that white man  Made a terrible mistake  And he requested that  Are you guys listening closely  To that clip?  He's not helping his cause  Not at all  I love the fact  That he's babbling  Like it's a punishment  I'm going to have  To spend eternity  With a bunch of  That's my penance  That I'll have to pay  Right  People say  Why is the dog buried there? 
[00:35:30]  Like people will care  No one's going to care  Six months from now  This stuff goes by fast  These days  We're having fun with him  But we'll stop talking about him  By tomorrow  Yeah done  So Larry King  Well he apologized  To Larry King  Yeah  I don't know why  He's apologizing  Not to Larry King  But  He's just  He's trying to cover  All his bases  I think he wants to  Apologize to everybody  On the face of the globe  One person at a time 
[00:36:00]  Yeah one show  One person  He really is an ass  A dope  How are you handling  All of this?  I'm  Still alive  Other than that  Not very  Not very good  I've been here several times  Sitting in front of you  Tonight  I felt like I was coming  To the electric chair  Really?  Really  Going on Larry King  Is like  Going to the electric chair?  The electric chair  What?  Maybe if my pacemaker  Goes off  And I grab you  By the shoulders  Right 
[00:36:30]  But  Other than that  I think Larry  Has the  The most comfortable  Chair in broadcasting  That you get to sit in  Larry needs an electric chair  So they can shock him awake  When he's going off  On one of his tirades  As he lobs softball questions  At you  Larry King's the electric chair?  Well his chair is special  Because it's like  It's like a first class chair  But it just goes back  Into a coffin  So when he eventually  Drops dead  He'll just go  And there's already  A satin pillow on it  And just put him  In the freezer  Basically he's saying  He was scared of Larry King 
[00:37:00]  Yeah  Larry doesn't even  Know where he is  Tonight I felt like  I was coming to the electric chair  Really?  I'm sorry  To tell you personally  First of all  I'm very sorry  I know you had also  A lot of faith in me  I'm very sorry  For using that word  Please don't think  Any less of me  And I'm going to fix  I'm going to fix  By the way  Bert from Philly  Irregular  Hey Owen  Oh wait  Hold on  Dog's knocking on my door  Let me go hear him grovel 
[00:37:30]  I'll be back  Yeah  He's going door to door  Just bang on everybody's door  Hi I'm dog  And I'm going to be  Buried with the  So please accept my apology  Now he's apologizing  To Larry King personally  For using the n-word  And my feet are going to be  Pointed away from the Potomac  So the second  I am resurrected  I can run away from the  As they're going over the Potomac 
[00:38:00]  Oh brother  How do you fix it  Well  I'll continue doing the things  I've done  Working with  You know  Interracial people  And  I just have to  What does that mean  Working with interracial people  Do you mean  Arresting them  Yeah  That's what he was doing  He said continue  You're right  Yeah  Working with interracial people  You know  When I was macing them  You know  And I take my fire extinguisher 
[00:38:30]  Full of mace  And just spray it in their face  I'll continue clubbing  And cuffing mongrels  All over the planet  What are you talking about  Why didn't I  How is he a buffoon  Why didn't I watch this show  Like I said  I would take a peek  Now I want to see every episode  Who knew  Do the right thing  And put this thing back on TV  I gotta see this guy  Who knew  I gotta see him working with  Interracial people  Interracial people  He doesn't even know  How to use the words right  Right  Well that's  He explains 
[00:39:00]  He has to work on his vocabulary  Oh is that it  Yeah here we go  I need to fix it  With you know  Interracial people  And I just have to  I have some classes  I have to go to  And I need to  Get a greater vocabulary  Than what I have  Obviously  And when I get mad  And my brain searches for a word  I have to find different words  And to do that  You have to be  Have a more of an education  Yeah  I can't just say 
[00:39:30]  You know  Larry  I have to  Sometimes use  Porch  Or  Or  Boo  Hey uh  Can you give me a beep  I'll tell you when  Alright  I'm wondering if  One of the classes  He has to take is  101  Yes of course  He needs a bigger vocabulary 
[00:40:00]  You can tell by the way  He's talking  He doesn't  He doesn't believe  Any of this  He's not sincere in it  And he's so  Out of the loop  On how to actually  Talk  In terms of  Racial equality  Or  You know  He's trying to  Apologize for racist remarks  And he doesn't even know  How to do that right  So  So if you get an education  That word leaves you  Or you know  Not to use it  Yeah that must be it  That's so stupid  That must be it  If I know not to use it  Like you have other words  They use it in Harvard 
[00:40:30]  Whoa  Some accusations  You're making  You don't think  There's a very intelligent  People walking around  The Harvard area  That are using that  That word  I don't think  There's intelligent people  Walking around who aren't  It's stupid to say  That with an education  That leaves your brain  Yeah  Or you make sure  You don't say it  That's so dumb  He's dumb  So you've had  When you say  A limited vocabulary  Due to not a great education  Well if I could  I graduated from  The 7th grade 
[00:41:00]  You know  I mean I  I dropped out of school  And I don't want to  Blame it on that  I know  Graduated from  The 7th grade  Wouldn't you say  You left school  After the 7th grade  Not graduated  From the 7th grade  Little 7th grade  Mullet headed  Yeah  Douche  With his little hat on  Grabbing his 7th grade diploma  Especially the 7th grade  Because that's the start  Of like  Junior high  Yeah  In most places I guess  Yeah that's pretty much  Where you start  Or in the middle of  Like junior high  Or middle school 
[00:41:30]  Whatever the hell  They call it  Yeah  Why don't you say  I graduated from  The 6th grade  Because that means  You're done with  Elementary school  Or  Yeah  Graduated from  Middle school  Which is what  After 8th grade maybe  I remember  At the end of  6th grade  For us  They had  What was called  A stepping up  Exercise  Oh boy  Yeah  And it was like  This kind of  Graduation thing  From elementary school  And the next year  You were going  Into junior high  So it was like  A stepping up  Exercise  They called it  And 
[00:42:00]  Yeah that's  6th grade  7th grade  You don't graduate  From 7th grade  The guy's an idiot  I'm proud to say  I graduated  From the 4th grade  I did good  With finger painting  And gluing leaves  On cardboard  I mean I  I dropped out of school  And I don't want  To blame it on that  I know right from wrong  I'm not that kind of guy  I knew  I probably shouldn't  Have never used that  But I thought  I was cool enough  To be able  To use that 
[00:42:30]  But to blame it  On ignorance  And unlearn it  That's not  No  I like the fact  That he's just  Implying that  The word is okay  If you're cool enough  Yeah if you're cool enough  Then it's fine  And we all know  How he used the word  You couldn't use  The word worse  You know what I mean  There are some white people  That could get away  With saying that word  In front of their  Black brothers  Their black friends  But how he used it  There's not a black man alive  That's not going to  Smack you upside your head  No that had nothing to do 
[00:43:00]  With just using it  In a cool  Like friendly way  I get what he's getting at  There are people  That feel like  Okay I hang with the brothers  They're friends  We work together  I know I could  I could just throw that  Out in a  In a quote nice way  Yeah  Or whatever  Yeah  But how he used it  There's not a black guy alive  It's when  When some white trash  White trash guy  With a mullet  Is yelling at his son  For going out with one  Right  That's not quite  You know  Thinking you were 
[00:43:30]  Yeah  Cool enough to use her  Or whatever  Yeah you're hanging out  Maybe talking hip hop  As a wannabe  Or something like that  It's a big difference  The only shot he has  Is that even in the conversation  He was like  I don't mean it  Like to say they're all bad  Or  It's almost like  He explains his context  Even though it sounds ridiculous  But while he's having  That conversation  He's like  But America would think that  Yeah  That's the only shot he has  Is that he did explain it  In context  While he was having that discussion  Right  All right  Final clip from Larry King 
[00:44:00]  Where's he gonna be tonight  Where's he gonna be  Anyone know  If the dog's  Apology tour  I gotta follow this guy  Until he finally gives up  Someone having him on  Can we please get him on  Yeah we should get him  Yeah let's get rolling  We should get him on our show  Well you talk to a lot of people  Come on  Get that dope on here  Here's the final thing  That was interesting  On Larry King last night  Email question from Lori  In Windsor, Ontario  My son went out on Halloween  As you dog  Dressed as you  When we came home  This story about your rant 
[00:44:30]  Was all over TV  My son is black  Any advice  You know how ridiculous  This kid must have looked  That must have looked silly  With a blonde ridiculous mullet  I'm the dog  Dog  Are you  My son is black  Any advice  How to explain to him  That you're not a hero  Well  Well  I said  I don't know about being a hero  I didn't want to be that  But if he went out there  As me  I'm proud of that  And that  Uncle Dog has learned 
[00:45:00]  There's certain words  You know  Let me tell you  Uncle Dog  All of a sudden  He's the Hulkster  The dogsters out there  Uncle  Eat your vegetables  Eat your vegetables  Take your vitamins  And say  Every day  Uncle Dog  Where did Uncle Dog come from?  I would stay away from the word  Uncle  When discussing this issue  Yeah  Uncle Dog 
[00:45:30]  If he went out there  40 minutes on this  Oh I'm sure  How do you not know that  Mother  Old queen  Want to be that  But if he went out there  As me  I'm proud of that  And that  Uncle Dog has learned  There's certain words  That you can never use  Oh  There are certain words  For instance  You can't yell  I've got a bomb  In an airport  There are certain words  In the English language 
[00:46:00]  That you cannot use  And the N word  Is one of them  Wow  Okay  Can you yell that  In an airport though?  Yeah  You're not going to teach everybody  That's great  You can't yell  There's a bomb  In an airport  But you can't  I love his analogies  They have nothing to do  With each other  Yeah  It's awful  He's an idiot  Like it's illegal  To drunk drive  And you also can't yell this  Alright good  Thanks  Name everything illegal  We got a little something here

[01:09:00]  If you're going to do Talk Like Tim Thursday, you've got to talk like Tim.  Hey, I just want a grand.  All right, that's a little better.  Yes, you were going to ask me to talk like Tim, but I forgot how.  Yeah.  Boston is winning a lot of money from this radio show.  I'm keeping track here.  Yeah, that's true.  It's a tight race, I should say, between New York and Boston.  Of course it is.  It always is.  There's competition all the time between the two cities.  And then every once in a while, Buffalo wins.  That's what I'm noticing. 
[01:09:30]  Very highly populated areas, though, in New York and Boston.  That's probably why the most callers.  But Boston gets another win today.  Congratulations, Steve.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing with the $1,000?  Buy some stuff for my house.  Maybe another plasma.  I need a truck.  I'm going to get a new one.  Linger longer.  Linger longer.  All right, Steve.  We'll say hi to Adam, Adam 12, and of course, Toucher and Rich.  Which one is the alcoholic, Toucher or Rich? 
[01:10:00]  Toucher.  Toucher, right.  Rich seems a little more responsible.  Toucher is the complete drunk.  Oh, my God.  They had a fun show.  I did it one time, and I could just tell that it was like 4.35 o'clock that I was dealing  with an alky.  He was not drunk.  You just knew.  Oh, yeah.  He was unshaven, and he looked like he had gotten up 20 minutes ago.  He probably did.  At the Halloween party?  Wow.  Of course, we're talking to the guys that do afternoons at BC on Toucher and Rich.  Yeah, we were up there for the Halloween party, and that guy was like, he was in Chris 
[01:10:30]  Farley land.  He was in like John Belushi land.  Yeah, that's what it was.  When we were sitting in the dressing room in the back, he was sitting in a chair, and  I fully expected him to open up a jar of mustard and dump it on his chest.  Right.  That's like his expression was just like that.  By the way, I don't want those guys to be confused.  These are all compliments.  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  What are you kidding?  This is how we compliment another radio show.  That is... 
[01:11:00]  Especially when you're doing afternoons.  God bless you.  You could get away with that crap.  Jeez.  I want to say something about Adam 12.  Yes.  He's been sticking up for you guys the last few days.  They got a bunch of angry callers about the awesome joke he did about Brady.  Well, Adam 12, I appreciate it.  He's a stand-up guy.  He was really cool to us when we were up there.  Everybody was really cool to us.  And just take a joke, will you?  That's all we ask from time to time.  Just take a lousy joke.  Relax.  We did a lot of Mike Brady jokes over the years. 
[01:11:30]  Carol Brady, all the Brady kids.  So I don't see what the problem is.  I keep sticking it to the manatees.  We hate those broads.  Our listeners got them pretty good.  Because there was a little comment section online, and they just took that over.  Can I share a very funny thing in the paper?  Please.  I want to say goodbye to Steve, so we can move on to Jimmy.  Okay.  Please don't confuse me.  I don't.  No, no.  Hey, Steve.  Thank you, buddy. 
[01:12:00]  Thank you.  In the New York Daily News, the title of the thing is No Bashing at Cruise Bash.  Apparently, this is a dinner for Tom Cruise.  And nobody wants to bash him, because, again, actors are just such easily offended little  fruits.  All of them.  They're not like comics.  They can't take anything.  Yeah.  Self-important idiots.  But this was a funny one.  Apparently, they were saying that Tom Cruise isn't above chop-busting, as Kenneth Branagh  can attest.  The British actor revealed that when he flubbed a line recently while filming Valkyrie about 
[01:12:30]  a plot to assassinate Hitler, Cruise joked, you're not very Shakespearean now, are you?  What?  What?  Wow.  That was one of his...  Well, he's not...  That was a zinger.  It says here, Cruise isn't above chop-busting, and then they list an example of chop-busting.  He was busting someone's chops.  Kenneth Branagh flubbed a line, and then Cruise joked, you're not very Shakespearean now, 
[01:13:00]  are you?  Oh, I hate actors.  I've made an ass of myself.  I like turtles.  Yes.  So do I.  So do I.  Damn!  You've just been pwned!  And you know what?  Everybody on this set probably laughed uproariously.  I'm sure.  Hey.  Because it was Tom Cruise saying it. 
[01:13:30]  By the way, I watch TMZ every single night.  We're trying to get someone from TMZ on our show.  I can't get enough of that show because they're not trying to hide what they are.  They're a show that just makes fun of celebrities and how ridiculous it is to be a celebrity and  how these celebrities think they're important and all that crap, right?  And they showed footage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes leaving some kind of premiere or something.  And Tom Cruise doesn't allow Katie Holmes to acknowledge attention when they're together.  And TMZ had a great video of this. 
[01:14:00]  They walk out of a restaurant or something like that and everyone's like, Tom, Tom, because  you know, there's movies coming out.  But you could also hear like the people going, Katie, Katie, over here.  I want to take your picture.  Katie, Katie.  No.  And she barely acknowledged.  She mustn't look.  She slightly nodded at one.  And TMZ pointed out, you know, Tom obviously has her on a short leash and it's all about,  look, when we're out together, it's all about me.  I mean, because she's famous in her own right, but she's not allowed to acknowledge the attention  when we're out together.  She wants to just go, help me, help, help me, help me, take me away. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, you lift that shirt, it says it on her stomach when it's cold.  She's blinking to the paparazzi.  Yeah, SOS.  She's blinking out codes.  She seemed to have had a twitch today.  Ooh.  I haven't had sex with a man in over a year.  Help me.  Help me.  I, allegedly, they lock me up like the gimp at night. 
[01:15:00]  I respect any show that doesn't hide what they are.  TMZ is like, look, look at this ridiculous celebrity talk.  Look at this ridiculous celebrity thinking, you know, they're important.  Look at this.  Yeah.  And that's why I love that show.  Because like the Insider and Entertainment Tonight, they're doing...  They want to be pals with the celebrities.  Right, so they kind of show you stuff, but they also will make sure they tell you that  they're kind of like pals and like it's all, you know, this is Hollywood and it's glitzy  and TMZ is like, it's not glitzy.  These people, for the most part, are asses. 
[01:15:30]  And we're going to show you at every turn how much of an ass these people are.  Anyway, we got Sam in studio because, of course, we got a new Angry Vince clip.  Yeah.  Now, any background on this one, Sam?  Because he sounded pretty angry.  Yeah, well, basically, he was talking to Shawn Michaels, who's a born-again Christian.  And Shawn Michaels is getting another shot against Randy Orton for the DWF title. 
[01:16:00]  Is he a real born-again Christian or a wrestling one?  No, he's a legitimate, because he went and had a family.  And...  I don't believe anything.  Well, he's telling Shawn that he knows Shawn wants revenge, not just another world title shot.  And born-again Christians is supposed to turn the other cheek, so he's trying to get Shawn  to admit that he's not a good person, and that he just wants revenge.  All right.  Great setup, but who cares?  It's all about listening to Angry Vince. 
[01:16:30]  Just listen to him.  We love Angry Vince.  I know what you're really all about.  Oh, you've changed, but you haven't changed.  Yeah.  Everybody reads the Bible every now and then.  We all hear about that.  Turn the other cheek.  But that's not what you're about.  Deep down, there's this part of your soul that's rotten.  Rotten.  And there's not a damn thing you can do about it, Shawn.  And you know the part I'm talking about. 
[01:17:00]  The part about an eye for an eye.  A tooth for a tooth.  Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.  Playing the part of the Lord is you, Shawn Michaels.  Admit it.  Admit it.  You want revenge on him.  You want.  You want to put him out.  Admit it, Shawn.  I know you.  I know you better than me.  I admit it.  So he's getting on the religious guy or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that the gist of it?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:17:30]  Let me tell you something.  One time I was walking down the beach and I saw two sets of footprints.  And I realized it was the moment of my life.  That's right.  The moment of my life.  And then during the most difficult parts of my life, I noticed there was only one set  of footprints.  That's right.  One set of footprints.  Just one set.  And I said, Jesus, why during the toughest times of my life did you abandon me? 
[01:18:00]  And he said, Vince, I didn't abandon you.  That's when I carry you.  I said, carry me.  Why didn't you just help me?  I could have locked myself.  I don't need your help, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but if he could carry you.  I told him, Christ, you're fine.  Then he reminded me I couldn't fire him. 
[01:18:30]  No.  No.  You're not that big, Vince.  No.  Hey, Vince.  I wish that limo gag would have worked out.  I was blown up in the limo.  Blown up dead.  And then I had to come back to life because some lunatic kills his family.  I mean, it would have made a great storyline if it wasn't true.  But he did.  He actually wrote that two weeks prior to the murders.  I was blown up in a limousine. 
[01:19:00]  And some rubes like Sam bought it.  You bought it, didn't you, Sam?  I admit it.  Yes, you admit it.  Hey, Vince, are you willing to accept Jesus Christ into your life?  Accept Jesus Christ.  Into your life, sir.  I came back three days later from a blown up car like Jesus.  I am Jesus Christ.  I'm the Lord.  I'm the Lord.  That's right.  Confession.  Confession?  I think you need to say it. 
[01:19:30]  Why do I have to confess to the likes of you?  You've done some awful things in your life, sir.  Awful things?  You might need to confess.  You're fired.  You can't fire me.  I don't wrestle.  Oh, you want a job?  Because after I hire you, you're...  Did you see the passion of the Christ, sir?  Don't even know what I'm saying.  The passion of the Christ?  Yeah.  Yeah, he got a beating. 
[01:20:00]  I would have liked to see Jesus in a ladder match.  He could take a beating.  He would have been good with mankind.  And I've bloodied the ring up.  Mankind and Jesus.  And a no holds barred.  No holds barred.  Maybe a cage match.  That's right, Jesus.  You're going in a cage match.  And you do it.  Only in a line clather.  You're...  You, uh...  You're...  I think Jesus is too busy. 
[01:20:30]  He can't wrestle for you, sir.  And don't think for one moment you're throwing that...  That crown of thorns in someone's eyes.  That's illegal.  The refs are gonna...  How about a hanging on a cross match?  A hanging on a cross match.  Yeah, but then he'll just resurrect himself three days later.  And rip me off because that's what I did.  Do you remember when my limo blew up?  That was big news. 
[01:21:00]  Big news!  Until a steroid-headed idiot had to kill his family.  What?  If he wasn't dead, he'd be fine.  You know, there's news coming out about that.  He had severe brain damage there.  And he was still wrestling.  That's right!  Well, half my staff has severe brain damage.  And they don't go killing their families or they'll be...  You know what?  I was in the Boy Scouts. 
[01:21:30]  I got a merit badge.  Yeah?  You know what for?  What?  Building a fire!  That's right!  I build a fire!  You like saying fire, huh?  Fire!  I am Cornholio.  Fire!  Fire!  Fire!  Fire!  How about Angry Vince Scott goes away for a minute so Angry Anthony can talk for the  next week? 
[01:22:00]  Well, let's say hi to Christina from Long Island.  Christina!  Christina!  What's up?  How are you?  I hear you're a born-again Christian.  You want to talk to me?  Born again?  What went wrong the first time?  You should tell your mother, she's fire!  That's right!  She's screwed it up the first time if you've got to be born again!  How does that work?  What are you going to put back?  That's it!  I want you and one of our hot chicks in a uterus match! 
[01:22:30]  Two go in, one comes out!  The other one's...  Angry Vince?  Yeah!  Yeah!  That's right!  Get on your hands and knees and repent!  That's it!  Repent like a dog!  Sit on your knees and repent for your sins! 
[01:23:00]  Christina!  That's right!  You were born again Christian?  What happened to you?  You genuflect!  Come on!  Genuflect!  What the hell?  What the hell?  I didn't know you knew so much about born-again Christians there!  Name of the Father, Son of the Holy God!  Sounds like some great wrestling names, huh?  You better accept Jesus, or you're going to burn in a fiery pit of fire!  That's right!  A lake of fire! 
[01:23:30]  I can't wait to talk about this at Bible study tonight.  It's going to be great.  Bible study?  You know what you do?  I'm not even kidding.  You take that book, and you make like you're preaching in the ring.  And then you take the holy Bible, and you smash it over your opponent's head!  That's right!  Smash the holy book over his head!  And then pick up a church pew and hit him in the back with it!  Screw the chair! 
[01:24:00]  I want a whole church pew!  You do it or you're wrong!  Violence doesn't work with religion, though.  Violence works everywhere!  Yeah?  That's right!  Anthony's going to be out for the next couple of days.  With a sore throat.  Let's go to Wayne in Syracuse.  Wayne, what's up, buddy?  Oh, man.  This man, that is great.  I just wanted you guys to know you're really awesome, man. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, we're awesome.  You know who's even more awesome?  God!  Our God is an awesome God!  Vince, is it true that you're trying to sign Jesus and Muhammad to a cage match or something?  A cage match!  Could you imagine that?  Jesus and Muhammad!  That's right!  Get in there and kick some ass!  No suicide bombing, though.  I want a straight-ahead fight.  No trickery.  No trickery. 
[01:25:00]  I don't want Jesus bringing in any nails and throwing them at him, either.  Or you!  I need hot water and honey.  That's right!  Bring me hot water and honey!  A new wrestler.  I'm going to call him Sucrets.  Here comes Team Lozenge. 
[01:25:30]  I hope.  My throat feels like it's on fire.  That's right!  Thank you, E-Rock.  What, were you saving these for dinner?  You brought me some cough drops.  Well, we're very privileged to have Angry Vince in studio today. 
[01:26:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Angry Vince.  It's always a pleasure when you stop by.  Angry Vince.  Ooh, cough drops.  Genuflecting.  That was a good one.  I don't even know what it means.  It was just brilliant.  It's that thing you do before you get in a church pew.  You ever see that?  They kneel down.  Go ahead, kneel in front of the pew and genuflect!  You kneel down and touch your head or something.  And then you get in the pew and start singing a hymn. 
[01:26:30]  That's right!  Grab a hymn book and start singing!  Go ahead, read the letter from the Corinthians!  That's right!  Read something from the Corinthians!  Jesus Christ.  I'm not taking his name in vain.  I'm trying to find him.  I want to hire him.  I want to hire you, Jesus.  So I can fire. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Someone wants to ask Vince if his favorite band is Earth, Wind, and...  I love Earth, Wind, and Fire!  That's right!  I like Earth, Wind, and Fire!  Letty from Springfield, New Jersey.  Thank you.  Why don't we take a break so we can continue the radio? 
[01:27:30]  Let's take a break!  Do you like the doors?  I love when they do fire!  Come on, baby.  Light my fire!  That's right!  Come on, baby!  Light my fire!  Try to set the night on fire!  That was fun.  I never get to talk to the characters.  The characters! 
[01:28:00]  I'm angry, Vince!  Hey, we're trying to...  After the break, I don't know if it's going to work, but...  That's the beauty of this show.  We try to crap out right in front of you.  That's why we're not on strike.  There's no writers on this show.  But we have a local resident story.  A bit we started yesterday.  I don't know if it's going to take off,  but Jimmy had a great observation  that these dumb news stories,  they always have to talk to local residents 
[01:28:30]  about the horror that's going on in their neighborhood.  And it's always the same reaction.  Of course they're going to be horrified  by what's happening in their neighborhood.  So why would you even talk to local residents?  If they don't add anything, they're just predictable.  So we got one.  I don't know if it's...  I don't know.  We'll try it.  We'll see what happens after the break.  Also, we got Adam Farrar from Rescue Me in studio.  Yes.  Doing some comedy dates.  We got Rob Bartlett.  Got to ask him if he's going to be part of Imus' new show.  Do we know?  Does he know?  I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  He's coming by.  He's a good friend of the show.  And then we got...  Who else?  Seton?  Seton Smith.  Oh, Seton Smith.  He's the dude that won Car Crash Comedy.  He won Car Crash in D.C.  He was a funny guy.  He did a good job on stage.  The crowd really liked him.  Very funny guy.  And he won a local competition.  And we threw him on stage when we did our virus tour this summer.  And he killed.  He really did.  He did great.  He came by to say hi because Otto said, yeah, he can just stop on by.  I'm going to explain to Seton how Otto blows people off.  Yeah.  Seton doesn't understand what Otto's...  I've known Otto for 15 years.  And I'll explain to him when he comes in. 
[01:29:30]  But you can never listen to Otto.  Okay.  And also, if you happen to be home tonight, my Leno is on at 1130.  Ooh.  Because they're re-airing everything now.  Oh, we'll probably be on.  God, if they go to ours, that would be awesome.  Yeah, they got Johnny's last show coming up.  Yeah.  Stupid Ellen walked the picket line, huh?  Have to.  You can't screw your writers, man.  You cannot.  No.  She is filming in L.A.  Oh, my God.  I didn't realize what you meant.  Doesn't that mean...  Oh, she crossed it.  I crossed it.  Yeah.  She crossed the picket line.  And her explanation was people... 
[01:30:00]  Well, we'll get the explanation next.  It's amazing.  Go to...  You know what?  I'll give them another plug today.  TMZ.  Yeah.  Enough of that sight.  But she crossed the picket line.  And her reasoning...  Were people booing?  Her reasoning was really lame.  She's a lesbian?  That would be lame.  We'll explain next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Something big.  No, not that. 
[01:30:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, we need a sound for tomorrow.  People love this $1,000 a day thing.  Do we have anything yet?  Hmm.  I'm trying to think of what we can do for tomorrow's sound.  I think we played a lot of our favorite ones already.  Did we? 
[01:31:00]  Kind of not prepared.  I'm sorry.  How about...  No, we're just testing.  All right, we're testing.  How about this one?  Okay.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  Play the whole thing.  You want to play the whole thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  Yeah, because he brings it home with the second part.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when he starts yelling.  So tomorrow we're going to play this between 7 and 7.30.  When you hear this, if you're the 10th caller, you'll win $1,000. 
[01:31:30]  Here's the sound once again.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  All right.  There's your sound for tomorrow if you want to win $1,000.  In studio, Adam Ferrara.  Hello.  What's up, Adam?  Hi, pal.  And also Rob Bartlett.  Yes.  Hi.  It's an all-star lineup today.  What's up, Rob?  Not much.  What's up with you, Ope?  Jimmy?  Hi, Rob.  Iraq?  Andy?  Are you going to be on Imus' new show?  Let's get right to it. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  Then get the F out.  Why?  Not competition yet.  We were friends, but now, you know, we're going to be competing against you.  No, no, no, no.  Get back.  Get up!  He's just getting, like, information to attack our weaknesses.  He's the third month.  It's a fact-finding mission.  Yeah, he's a spy.  So you got the call, and you're going to be on Imus.  I got the call.  Hey, congratulations, man.  Thank you.  How about Bernie? 
[01:32:30]  All I know is me at the moment.  Because, to be honest with you, that's all I care about.  Yeah, you know, as far as everybody else is.  Who said you're in, he hung up.  That's it.  That's it.  I'm in it.  Thanks.  That's all.  When?  December 3rd.  I'm there.  All right, so this is your last appearance on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Then we got people who don't know you, and we hate you.  Well, I haven't signed it yet.  No?  You know, luck can happen.  Yeah, you never know.  Luck can happen.  You know what I mean?  If I have a good shot here today, who knows?  Well, I'm leaving here to do a show with Ron Cooby.  Yeah.  Oh, the douche Ronnie. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, poor Ron.  Ron Cooby.  Oh, man.  He has a stupid-looking beard.  We got to explain for the rest of America.  Ron Cooby has some good points.  He really does.  He got canned so they could bring Imus to ABC here in New York City, and he was doing  a show with Curtis, who I hate.  He's just a douche, but he was doing well in morning radio, and they fired Cooby, and  they're going to move Curtis to another time slot, I guess.  With another host.  And Kirby's like, why do I have to suffer, because Imus effed up? 
[01:33:30]  Sorry, that's the business.  Welcome to showbiz, baby.  Yeah.  But as a lawyer, right?  Yeah.  I have no sympathy whatsoever.  None at all.  We've suffered because your clients are screwed up, so how's that?  No, it's stupid.  Oh, there you go.  You defended Colin Ferguson.  I like to spit.  Colin.  And Bernie.  I'm sorry.  But Daryl Kaby, he was the one who went after Bernie Getz for Daryl Kaby.  Yep.  You know, my client had dreams, and then Bernie goes, sorry, but a lot of times the  victim doesn't think about the dreams of his assailant. 
[01:34:00]  Getz rules.  That was before he went completely nuts, and we had him on the show.  Yeah.  Oof.  Yeah.  And we liked when he came in, and I blew it.  It was fun, but then you had to ruin it by smashing his music.  Hey, you know what, his sacred CDs that he brought into play for us.  F. Ham, he could have come back.  You didn't do anything terrible.  You didn't even break his thing.  You were just goofing on him.  He can't take that?  Hey, for onaradio.com, could you give him the Bernie Getz attack?  By the way, you know, it was pointed out that E-Rock saved my life that day. 
[01:34:30]  He got between Bernie Getz and myself.  When Bernie, I guess we got to explain it.  Dude, when you're number two on someone's MySpace hero list.  Right.  Of course he's going to jump in between.  Right.  Your top, I think, three, you take a bullet for.  It was his father, it was you, and Hulk Hogan.  And little E-Rock would have taken a bullet for either one, any of you.  We don't have actual, we have surveillance video, because we weren't filming that day. 
[01:35:00]  But Bernie Getz, of course, the subway vigilante, he shot what, three or four guys?  Four guys.  Four guys.  And he came in, because of Ben.  Ben made some kind of relationship with Bernie Getz.  Oh, and you, Jimmy?  That was my suggestion.  Okay.  I could get Bernie, and Ben jumped on it and got him.  Yeah, and so Bernie started coming in, and he would give us gray radio.  He was out of his mind, and he wanted to talk about, like, organic food and...  Squirrels.  And squirrels.  Enough about the squirrels.  Holy jeez, I forgot about that. 
[01:35:30]  The guy's obsessed with squirrels.  Yeah.  And then it, uh...  Total OCD.  Complete OCD.  He would just spread his papers out, and then neaten them.  It's like, what are you doing?  You shot four people.  Just straighten the papers out.  Because they touch my papers!  Yeah, those papers, I think they, you know, in his head were something else.  Let's lay them out nicely.  Yes.  Safely.  They're not going to come up and hurt me.  He was always fiddling.  They could never be straight enough.  Fiddle.  For this guy.  This paper doesn't look so bad.  Here's another.  Yeah.  Here's another. 
[01:36:00]  So, then he came in to play some of his tunes.  And what they meant to him.  And he gave me his CDs.  And in the middle of him, like, playing music, I decided to smash his stuff right in front  of his face.  And this was an interesting moment.  He ran out of the studio, and he brought kind of like a gym bag with him.  Yeah.  He ran out and was rifling through his gym bag.  And then he came running back in.  And I'm like, did he, like, have a reaction?  Like, you know, I have a gun.  And then realized he can't bring a gun into a radio station. 
[01:36:30]  But remember that?  He ran out.  Yeah, yeah.  Was rifling through the bag and then came back into the studio.  We knew he didn't have anything in his hand.  And I think he was frustrated.  Like, oh, I didn't bring it.  All I was thinking is, here he comes.  Here he comes with a gun.  You're going to pump a few into Opie and then maybe spray the room with some more bullets  and leave.  You've got to do a show with Ron Cooby.  Yeah.  Great.  And then he tried to get at me.  And I had no problem if Bernie got to me.  But E-Rock decided to jump in the middle.  Yep.  And he was like a hero that day.  The brave E-Rock.  Bernie's like reaching around him and stuff, freaking out. 
[01:37:00]  How brave of Eric to jump in front of a 110-pound vegetarian.  Carrying a newspaper.  Good point.  Capu also, by the way, loves the garlic buttersaw.  Yeah.  Garlic buttersaw.  Hey, there's the video.  We're going to put it up on onaradio.com later today.  But there's a surveillance video of the incident.  He looks a lot like Meryl Streep.  Oh, well, that's...  Wrong street.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  We need that clip just to play.  Garlic buttersaw.  Yeah, well...  Ugh. 
[01:37:30]  Ugh.  Oh, yeah, thank you.  Someone's reminding me, I don't...  Bad cell phone guy from Wackback, that he was also running for mayor.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's why he came in our show.  And there's the part where he's trying to get at me and E-Roc's in the way.  He was trying to get his CDs back and stuff, I think.  I don't know.  He was angry.  He was kind of angry, so...  It was just creepy to see it on a surveillance video.  What kind of music was he into?  Was it like, you know, Casey and the Sunshine Band and that kind of stuff?  Or...  I don't remember anymore.  I don't remember at all, actually.  Billy, don't be a hero?  Not Motown.  All right, hey, we got a flight attendant trying to be funny and amusing during pre-flight 
[01:38:00]  instructions.  Oh, go ahead, Dan.  This was before you had moved on to the next subject.  Just some of the music he liked, but now I feel like I'm stopping everything.  It's okay.  Go ahead.  It was like crash test dummy B-sides.  That's what...  Wow.  That was some of the stuff he aired.  Yeah, that's why we don't remember.  Whoa.  Okay.  Thanks for sharing, Dan.  All right, Dan.  That's right.  We got a flight attendant trying to be funny and amusing during pre-flight instruction.  Ooh.  Oh, that's wonderful, I bet. 
[01:38:30]  And then whoever put this together also wrote, and he's gay.  Dot, dot, dot.  And he's gay.  A male flight attendant?  Gay?  No.  Stop it.  Let's listen to this, see what this is about.  We do have seatbelts.  They're not as dangerous as they look to.  They're into the flat and into the buckle to release lift up on the buckle.  They should be worn like J-Lo's pants, low and tight across the hips, and any time you are seated.  If you don't like our service, if the flight gets too long, we have six emergency exits. 
[01:39:00]  Two forward exit doors, two over-wing window exits, and two rear exit doors.  Signs overhead and lights on the floor lead to those exits.  In your seat back pocket, this beautiful, illustrated, multicolored safety information card,  you may notice in that card that in case of a water evacuation,  we have hidden under each and every seat of this plane a beautiful yellow life vest.  Please only remove that vest when told to do so.  Now to remove it, pull down on the red tab on the container under your seat.  Open the container, take out the pouch, take out the vest, put it over your head.  Already you look beautifully fashionable.  However, to extenuate your waist, wrap that black strap around and buckle it in front. 
[01:39:30]  Once outside the aircraft, inflate the vest by blowing it to the tube at your shoulder  or pulling down at the tab in front.  Wait, there was the one part they cut, too.  We were talking about blowing up the inflatable part of the vest,  and then he goes, and then take it out and slap yourself in the face with it.  When your father walks in, say he made you.  We have six exits, two in the rear and one in my pants.  If we hit any turbulence, come sit on my face and wiggle.  Why do they feel it's necessary to teach you how to buckle your seatbelt on a plane? 
[01:40:00]  I don't know.  Is it any different than a car seatbelt that's been around for ages?  Who doesn't?  If you don't know how to buckle the seatbelt, you don't understand the concept of flight,  and you're going to die of a heart attack when you leave the ground.  What the?  Ah!  It's buckling a seatbelt.  It's just, you know, seatbelts useful.  Sudden unexpected stop in a car.  Sudden unexpected stop in an airplane.  Boot point.  Yeah.  The cockpit will come to you.  Yeah, I read that the seatbelts just are there so they could, like, recover all the bodies. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  But that's the most annoying thing on a plane when they talk,  like when the captain tells you how high he's going to fly.  I don't care.  Just get me there.  I care.  I don't care what instruments you're looking at, how high you're going to go.  Land the friggin' plane, then we'll chat.  See, you're an experienced flyer, Adam.  You've been on a bunch of flights.  I like when the pilot talks to you.  I feel a little safer.  Just give me an update every ten minutes.  I'd be really happy.  I'm just sailing, uh, Opie, uh, there in the, uh,  the pier from the flight deck, uh, rear, on about 35,000 feet. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, but when the plane's bouncing around and he doesn't come on, I'm freaking out.  If you look at the left side of the plane, you'll see the Grand Canyon.  Basically, I have no idea where the hell I am.  Uh, we just lit a duber up here, and, uh, we're having a good time.  A little bumpy for you, so I'm going to try to get there as soon as we can.  Well, you know, I'll keep those seatbelts tight around your waist, 
[01:41:30]  because, uh, I'm going to do a couple of tricks here, uh,  just going to shake it there in first class, and, uh,  well, holy God, what was that?  Just kidding, just kidding.  You don't want to hear.  Yeah, I think I just saw a UFO.  Flight attendant Kathy is a size queen.  I can't have that soon.  Thanks.  That's what I want to hear.  Here's more of, uh, the flight attendant.  Andrea and Barbara are coming through the cabin now  to check that your seatbelts are fastened,  your shoes match your outfit.  Your seatbelts and tray tables are raised to their most uncomfortable 
[01:42:00]  full upright lock position,  and all your carry-on items are stuffed, crowned, shoved,  pushed, smushed, smushed all the way under the seat in front of you,  leaving the area around your feet clear.  Although we have my intestines.  That's funny.  It's funny because it's true.  Although we never anticipated changing cabin pressure,  should one occur for beautiful golden, 
[01:42:30]  I can't believe it's not buttercup lookalike?  Design or oxygen masks will magically appear  from secret hidden compartments above your head.  When that happens, immediately stop screaming,  let go of your neighbor.  Pull down one of those masks until the plastic tubing is fully extended.  Insert a quarter for every minute of oxygen.  Although the bag on your mask may not inflate your neighbor's will,  but you will be receiving oxygen.  What is this?  The douche airlines?  Who wants to fly on that plane? 
[01:43:00]  That would be, this is what I would like to hear from the cockpit, too.  And, gentlemen, we're at 35,000 feet.  Everything seems to be okay.  Oh, Jesus Christ!  Oh, my God!  Just like you hear all the alarms going off.  Don't mind that.  Barney?  Yeah, I told you not to touch that.  That's our co-pilot, Barney.  He's new up here.  It was actually on some British Airlines flight,  where the thing about turbulence, turbulence, 
[01:43:30]  where you're going, it was some...  I like, my favorite one is pull up, pull up, pull up.  That is one you never, ever want to hear.  One of them went off in flight,  but it was only, it was a technical malfunction.  It wasn't the actual issue.  Yeah.  I heard it.  Oh, freaking out.  I actually, I got a flight delayed in Florida  because one of the crew guys,  you know the guys with the lights,  got hit by the plane.  That seems rough.  And they told you the truth.  And the guys, and you know,  some of us started laughing. 
[01:44:00]  He goes, don't laugh.  You know, they wear ear protection.  They can't hear the plane.  I'm like, it's kind of hard not to see a 747.  Is there no shadow?  Yeah, a big shadow getting dark or something.  What's that shiny thing?  Oh.  That's got to suck.  Hey, we got the toy recall fire.  Warning, warning.  The pilot's a...  Hi, this is Bill Johnson, your captain.  Not Captain Johnson! 
[01:44:30]  Not Captain Johnson?  Captain Johnson.  That's got to say head on.  Head on.  Not Captain Johnson.  Captain Johnson.  What is this?  He used to fly a zero over the slot.  Took down a lot of Corsairs.  What is a string of Peloponies?  You put it in my head, Norton,  and I won't be able to get it out of there now.  All right.  Hey, we got a toy recall.  This one's terrific.  Oh, this is the best. 
[01:45:00]  You heard about this one?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, the list of toy recalls is growing.  A popular children's toy is being pulled  because it contains a chemical  that mimics the date rape drug  if it is swallowed.  Tiffany, this is really quite a story.  And as you say, adding to the list of recalls,  this is considered one of the most popular toys  this holiday season in Australia.  It won Toy of the Year.  It's called Aquadots.  And yes, when swallowed,  it turns into GHB, a date rape drug, 
[01:45:30]  and they want to get it off the shelves.  Why?  Do they?  Do they really want to get it off the shelves?  Really?  It was manufactured by that flight attendant.  Well, they knew it was a problem  because now adult guys are going to buy it  and just try to hand it their dates.  Here, eat this toy.  Why?  Just do it.  Uncle Paul's waiting on the line of TRU as we speak.  TRU.  Aquadots.  Yeah, why bother with that?  I mean, a handful of M&Ms works just as well.  Really?  As a date rape drug?  Yeah.  Well, you know, when you talk about... 
[01:46:00]  Oh, my God.  Right, hold on.  Thank you.  Rob Bartlett was fired from the IMAS show  before even IMAS came back.  This is a first in the business.  We don't understand how this could possibly happen.  Here's the audio.  It is one of the most popular toys on the market right now,  Aquadots,  and it is being pulled from the shelves  throughout North America and Australia  because it contains a chemical  that turns into a powerful date rape drug when it's eaten.  Two children in the U.S. and three in Australia 
[01:46:30]  have been hospitalized after swallowing the beads.  Aquadots is an arts and crafts type toy  that can be arranged into designs  infused when sprayed with water.  Scientists say a chemical coating on the beads  when ingested metabolizes into the date rape drug GHB.  When eaten, the compound can induce unconsciousness,  seizures, drowsiness, coma, and even death.  In the U.S., two kids who swallowed the Aquadots beads  went into non-responsive comas 
[01:47:00]  but are now recovering.  What's up with the Chinese and their toys?  You're not supposed to eat the Aquadots, are you?  That's like saying that you can't have marbles  because when you swallow one, they mimic kidney stones.  How about this?  Don't eat it, stupid.  No, but that can't be a mistake.  It's a chemical on it.  I don't really get this game.  Who has kids?  Aquadots.  What is it?  But what is it?  It looks like it's an artsy, crafty kind of a thing.  Yeah, it's like the B-Dazzler.  Dots magically join with water. 
[01:47:30]  All right, here comes Danny.  What's up, Danny?  Danny.  What the hell is this?  It's exactly what it is.  It's like an arts and crafts style toy  where you put these little beads in different patterns  and to finalize it, you just add water to it  and they all kind of fuse together.  So it's not like a game.  It's just like a little arts and crafts thing for kids.  It's like Light Bright without batteries.  Exactly.  Puts the gay in game.  That you could finalize with.  Nothing.  What a minute, Danny.  Open your mouth.  Put this under your tongue.  I wanted to like it because it was mean and ignorant.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:48:00]  What an awful game.  Toys R Us says it has issued a stop sale  on all Aquadot's products  in compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Commission recall.  Now, you may recall that we've heard a lot about products  from China this past year.  Toothpaste, lipstick, pet food.  Yankee cranky employees.  Toys R Us with lead and now with this G-H-B drug.  Even Japton Johnson was grounded. 
[01:48:30]  That was great.  Pace, lipstick, pet food.  And now, of course, the toys with the lead  and now with this G-H-B drug.  Many people saying that the U.S. government  and the Consumer Safety Commission  needs to do a lot more about our dealings with China.  China is just, they are where we were  in like the early 1900s.  No.  That's where they are.  We never killed female babies.  No, with all that fun like, you know,  Chinese Communist stuff.  Right. 
[01:49:00]  But their whole economy and everything,  their like industrial age that they've entered  is kind of like that.  But they got a hell of a lot of people,  a lot of money,  and they're entering the world market.  But now, in the United States,  you know, there's all kinds of stringent laws  and everything that have to be adhered to  when you make things,  especially for children, blah, blah, blah,  food and everything.  But then we import stuff from China  because it's cheaper,  and you get what you pay for.  And do you think there's one safety inspector? 
[01:49:30]  There probably is just one.  One guy that shuffles around  from factory to factory  over the entire billion square miles of China  checking up.  He doesn't have time to study the aqua dots.  I can't do it all.  Don't do the voice.  We'll be fired.  That's why I didn't do the voice.  If you do that voice.  You're not allowed to do that voice on radio anymore.  Are you crazy?  Can you believe it?  Wow.  Can you believe it? 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  I can't even go downstairs  and talk to a guy,  an Asian gentleman,  and come up and then  do an imitation of him  back and forth of our conversation.  You're kidding.  No, but would I kid you?  I understand.  See the panic in our faces, Adam?  People are saying,  they're saying unbelievable here,  but they're spelling it differently.  Yeah, they're importing all their crappy products.  Yeah.  So now we get that,  and then people are saying  that the U.S. government's  going to have to step in  and start inspecting this stuff. 
[01:50:30]  We're paying the ass for that.  Then it kind of defeats the purpose  of getting this stuff cheap.  We'll have the one guy, too,  walking up and down.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's nothing sharp.  Yeah, it looks fine to me.  Yeah, sorry.  They're going to test,  like they're going to take little samples  and test them for lead  and chemicals that turn into date rape drugs  and stuff.  It's probably the same guy  that just checks all those containers  you see on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my.  Holy.  What the?  Oh, my.  Oh. 
[01:51:00]  I don't feel safe.  Who does?  For the rest of America,  New Jersey Turnpike,  you drive by the,  what is it called officially,  the docks?  I don't know.  And they got these containers  that are piled up as high as you could see.  Yeah, then they throw them  on the back of tractor trailers.  There's thousands and thousands,  and they're piled up like,  I don't know,  like 20 high  in massive groupings.  They look like buildings.  And, you know,  they try to tell us on,  you know,  on the news that,  you know,  they're checking all this stuff  or dirty bombs.  We got dogs sniffing them. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah,  you drive by this area one time  and you don't feel safe at all.  No.  Who the F checks all those containers?  They don't.  There's just one guy going,  ah,  that looks all right.  They don't.  They're not opening all those containers.  It's impossible.  We have this perception of safety  here in this country  just enough  to keep people  from running down the street  naked,  pulling their hair out of their head.  That's like where we are.  We're just on that brink  constantly.  And there's a few people  in Washington,  probably in a basement somewhere, 
[01:52:00]  that just know the score  and are just like,  oh my God,  if they only knew,  our whole country would collapse.  They just,  I really believe that.  What year is it?  What year is it out there?  Yeah.  They're just sitting down there going,  oh,  it's another two months.  We made it through that?  Thank God.  All right.  I took the over,  but I was good.  Yeah,  they're betting.  They just know it's over.  What's the spread?  The Mayan calendar says 2011.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Whatever.  You get a picture  of those containers,  though,  then you realize  that's a bunch of crap.  Well,  thank God I can't bring shampoo  on a plane  because that makes me feel safe.  Yeah.  The little bottles of shampoo.  You can't do that.  Your shoes.  But you go through,  like,  you go through the tunnel here  and it's just,  okay,  vans,  everything.  Yeah.  People.  A guy in a turban  driving a van  with no plates.  Come on.  Let's go.  Yeah,  I don't get that,  the inspection at the tunnels.  It's a kind of lie.  It's kind of random.  Unmarked van. 
[01:53:00]  But SUVs  with tinted windows  can be just as dangerous  as any rented moving van.  Yeah.  You know,  with the right stuff inside.  And those aren't checked at all,  you know?  They always have the suicide bomber  velvet painting on the side.  You know,  that picture they always take  before they kill themselves.  Yeah.  They get a little testimonial.  Yeah,  yeah,  the video.  Hey,  Adam,  you're part of Dennis Leary  and Friends tonight?  Yeah,  tonight at the Beacon.  I'm going to that.  I will see you there.  I'm going to that  to see my pal Adam Farrar. 
[01:53:30]  And if he gets starts anything,  I'm jumping right in the middle of it.  Who's on it,  Adam?  Dennis,  me,  and I'm not quite sure who else.  And some other guys.  I know,  friends.  Nobody else matters.  Let's go to Jess or Jesse from Jersey.  Jess,  I guess.  What's up?  Good morning,  boys.  Hey.  Oh,  I actually wanted to give you credit.  You couldn't be more than right  about those shipping yards  down in Newark and Elizabeth  that you see off the turnpike.  Yeah.  I drive a truck.  I'm not going to say for who,  but you pull in,  the guards right there,  you wave at them,  and they let you right through.  You could drive around there  aimlessly for hours 
[01:54:00]  and nobody would ever even say a word.  You know,  when I drive through that area,  I take my visor,  my,  my,  you know,  visor in the car,  and I just move it to the left.  I don't see that.  I am not seeing this.  I don't see what's going on over there.  That don't look safe.  I don't want to see it.  You guys are killing today,  man.  Huh?  You guys love the show.  You guys are killing today.  I love it.  Oh,  thank you.  Thanks,  Jess.  Tell a friend,  will you?  We like killing.  Borgata last year.  I'm looking forward to it again this year.  The Borgata?  Yes.  Oh,  thank you.  January 18th and 19th. 
[01:54:30]  Just talk over his plug.  Just keep talking.  Why not?  Why not?  You had a perfect segue for Jimmy to give his dates,  and you stepped all over it.  Trotted upon it.  We're robots here.  He heard Borgata,  and then he wanted to go into plug mode,  and we were done with you there,  Jess.  It's January 18th and 19th,  a Martin Luther King weekend,  and a ticket score on sale this Saturday morning  at 10 a.m.  TheBorgata.com.  All right.  And Saturday night,  I'm going to see Rob Bartlett.  Oh,  Rob,  where are you going to be?  Seven Angels Theater in Waterbury,  Connecticut.  And soon to be heard on the 
[01:55:00]  I Miss in the Morning radio program.  Rob's a great stand-up.  My father and me.  I hired him back.  I'm sorry I did that.  I apologize that I did that.  My dad and I saw Rob together years ago.  It was a very nice father-son moment.  I'm actually responsible for a tender sentiment.  Yes.  A tender sentiment.  Linger longer.  That was Rob,  because I hate when I say it.  Just say that many times,  please.  Sure. 
[01:55:30]  I love being obnoxious.  Linger longer.  I love being obnoxious.  I'm a linger.  Steve,  Jersey,  what's up?  Yo.  Steve,  let's go.  Hello.  Hey,  what's up?  What's up?  How are you doing,  guys?  Hey,  buddy.  Listen,  I worked down there,  and I worked for many,  many hours.  I was there driving down there one night,  a little lost,  because I was trying to get to a shop  I had just started.  I ended up in one of those container yards,  no security,  nothing.  Those guys,  I saw farmers down there cooking  what looked like half a dog  in a shopping cart.  In a shopping cart. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  I know my way around there  and I'm a farm now.  It's not an issue,  but I was cruising down there  and I couldn't believe what I saw.  And there was absolutely no security.  I mean,  I drove through there,  there was nothing going on.  I think a video game setting,  all those crates  and you're walking around  and there's homeless guys  just like eating a dog  out of a shopping cart.  They don't knock it to you,  try to hit them with a crowbar  and move on.  You know,  most politicians are full of crap,  but one brought to everyone's attention  that these containers, 
[01:56:30]  they're piled up to the clouds  and it doesn't look like  we could actually check  all these things for dirty bombs.  No.  Can they x-ray them or something?  They have some technology.  Dude,  there are thousands.  You know what I'm talking about.  When you go down the pike.  Oh,  this is great.  When you get a text  from somebody in the know,  let's just say  somebody in the know  that says,  don't worry,  the Department of Homeland Security  is protecting the docks.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Duck. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, no.  And this is somebody  that knows.  Great.  Oh, no.  Is this somebody also mad  that you went gambling about them?  No, no, not that.  Somebody that knows even more.  Really?  That guy's name was Ted Portnork.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, we're going to take a break.  You know, this is good.  We got Rob Bartlett in the studio.  He's going to be on Imus' show  when Imus comes back.  December 3rd?  December 3rd.  So this is your last appearance on the show.  We got to start making believe  we don't know you anymore. 
[01:57:30]  I'm sorry.  Aw.  December 3rd on 92.3.  K-Rock.  Yes.  Why doesn't Imus just call us?  Right now.  He doesn't like you.  He likes you.  Hey, Rock, tell Imus to call us right now.  I want you to go over.  That's probably what Imus was doing, though.  I want you to go over to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let them think you're not satisfied with my program  and that you want to join them  and then get as much information as you can about the Turk.  And whoever comes to you to raise a meeting 
[01:58:00]  is the one.  I hope your first sponsor is a masculine sponsor.  He's going to go back to Imus for the list of the bits we're doing.  Okay, they do Talk Like Tim Thursday.  They do a Linger Longer bit.  Angry Vince.  Dummy Thursday.  Huh?  Dummy Thursday.  Just watch out for Fake News Tuesday.  Are you insane?  No.  No.  I guess your electric shock didn't work too well. 
[01:58:30]  More with Rob Bartlett.  Speaking of Imus and what I was getting at,  Damon Wayans was sticking up for Imus on The View.  And then he said something that was hilarious.  He said that women should just cook.  On The View?  Yeah.  Really?  That sat well with the girls, I'm sure.  Well, we'll find out after the break.  There's your Radio T's.  All right.  He's a pro.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let's continue to rock.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:59:00]  We are rocking.  Whatever that means.  Rock.  All right.  So we got...  In our own feces.  Of course, Jim Norton.  He's here every day.  Then we got Adam Farrar.  He's doing Dennis Leary and Friends tonight at the Beacon Theater,  7 o'clock.  Rescue Me when the writer's strike is over.  Rob Bartlett in studio.  He's playing...  In Westbury.  Westbury.  Waterbury.  Waterbury.  Waterbury.  Saturday night.  Frankie Five Angels.  At the Seven Angels Theater.  Seven Angels Theater this Saturday night.  Waterbury. 
[01:59:30]  Waterbury.  Connecticut.  RobShow.com for more info.  Yeah.  And then we got Seton Smith.  How y'all doing?  How y'all doing?  One car crash in D.C.  Did very well on stage.  He did great on stage.  Yeah.  He won car crash comedy and then went up there and killed in front of...  God, I don't know how many people are at that show.  10, 12,000.  Somewhere around there, probably.  Yeah.  There you go.  And you were saying that Dr. Bounty Hunter, you thought that stuff was hilarious?  Yeah, I thought it was just beautiful.  Anything, I was talking to my girlfriend about this.  I mean, I don't know very many black people that were very surprised that a man with a 
[02:00:00]  white man with a mullet was just throwing the N-word out there.  I mean, why is the world shocked by this?  I mean, if Peter Jennings wanted to just bust it out, okay, we're offended.  But, I mean, come on.  I don't think the world is shocked, by the way.  No.  Even Reverend Al is just kind of like, ah, I'm just sitting on the sidelines for this  one.  Yeah, there's no shock and outrage and everything.  Yeah, the coach doesn't have to call him and, you know, get me in the game on this one.  I'm just going to sit this one out.  People just can't believe what an ass this guy really is.  I think even black people are just enjoying this one.  You know what it is, too?  It's purely visual.  Like, you don't need Reverend Al or anybody to step up and say, this man is unbelievable. 
[02:00:30]  What he said is crazy.  You just got to kind of take your hand, point it at him and go, ah, you're on a look at  him.  You see what he's wearing, though?  He's wearing, like, an open-collar shirt with his long Jesus chain.  Like, who does that when they're apologizing?  He's very calculated.  Long-earing.  He's just a fool.  I was shocked that Dog actually said that he would kill himself if it was going to make  people...  I got to tell you, Mikey, I would kill myself if I thought that it was going to make people  forgive me.  I would kill myself if I thought it was going to make people forgive me. 
[02:01:00]  You got to give me a lot of credit.  A lot of credit.  I want to be better with the slaves.  Better with the slaves.  That's what I want to do.  Rob, do you need aspirin?  Why?  What's the matter?  Oh, nothing.  I'm just joking.  Huh?  Oh, he was being silly, so I thought, you know.  I was giving him some aspirin.  I was doing Mad Dog Rooster instead of Dog the Bounty Hunter.  See, that dog.  See, now it came together.  See, there's a clue that I am. 
[02:01:30]  I enjoyed it, but I didn't know why you did Mike Russo and then Mad Dog.  There you go.  See, it's too many steps, as we like to say.  Like a flight and a half.  That's why I said you need aspirin, but see, it turns out you're very intelligent.  It was very good.  It was very good.  It's bad for him to be that far ahead of the hosts.  Let me dumb things down a little bit here.  I knew what you were doing, sir.  You did, sir.  See, Ed gets all my references.  What's going on?  Oh, give me your awkward dots.  You realize Imus talks to 25 to 64-year-olds. 
[02:02:00]  We talk to 12 to 18-year-olds.  So dumb it down.  That old?  That's a private life.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, swim walking.  It's the first swim walk of the day, Jimmy.  All right.  Hey, Damon Wayans was on The View defending Imus.  Rob Bartlett's going to be on Imus' new show for WABC.  Why we're promoting it, I don't know.  We're that damn stupid.  We're dopes.  We're going to be competing against you guys in like two or three weeks here in New York.  This is what Damon had to say, which is hilarious because it was on The View.  And, of course, The View chicks can't take a joke. 
[02:02:30]  Of course not.  Just listen closely.  They have to jump right in on this.  No.  And for the people down the hall, it's a black dude saying what Imus said when he got fired,  so let it go through.  Black people are allowed to say this.  Really?  Yeah, I'm learning the rules.  Black people are allowed to say stuff white people aren't allowed to say.  I get it now.  All right, dog.  When he called him nappy-headed hoes, I went, wow, he's right.  Now, that's a great laugh, right?  Huge laugh.  Huge laugh.  However, had a white comic done it on that show, they would have been. 
[02:03:00]  No, no, no, no.  Ooh, that would have been.  The audience would have been great.  Ooh.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, but that's why I stopped it right there because he's getting just a great laugh.  Why don't you let it just be a great laugh?  We'll watch what happens.  Uh-oh.  When he called him nappy-headed hoes, I went, wow.  He's right.  They're not hoes?  See, they gotta jump right in.  Why do they have to jump right in?  Why don't you just enjoy the comedic moment?  Yeah, it's a joke.  Because they're broads.  Yeah, and if you really have to do it, the laugh dies down, you do your little finger wave. 
[02:03:30]  Now, Damon.  Right.  And that's it.  They gotta jump in right away.  They're not hoes.  That's what they do.  They tsk, tsk.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Now that we...  Shut up.  Just a bunch of joke.  Yeah.  That's why it's very funny.  Yep.  When he called him nappy-headed hoes, I went, wow.  He's right.  They're not hoes?  No.  That's why I don't think I'm going to take it to the area.  No.  See, we say that.  I'm saying the black people can say that. 
[02:04:00]  Look, and then all of a sudden, Damon's like, ah, now he's in the position where he's got to,  like, explain himself.  I'm sorry I said that.  Why does he have to feel like he has to explain that he was just going for a quick joke there?  Because he got just jumped on by a bunch of hens.  Well, let's see how he did.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  See, we say that.  I'm saying the black people can say that about each other, but you know...  Damon, Damon, Damon. 
[02:04:30]  These girls are not hoes.  They're hardly respected.  No, no, no.  Listen, listen, listen.  No, they're not.  You know what?  Black people are home laughing right now.  White people are sitting there going, well, that's not right.  Do you know women's basketball players, women basketball players, college basketball players,  are not respected?  No.  They're not.  They're well-respected athletes.  No, they're not.  They're pretty much like field hockey players.  They're not respected either. 
[02:05:00]  If they were respected, they wouldn't be on ESPN 12.  Yeah.  That's like live on the Ocho.  Right.  The big game.  No one does contests around women's basketball?  No.  And we're talking like college.  Yeah.  Women's college basketball.  The games last too long anyway.  It's got 130 periods.  All right.  You know something?  You know something?  A little hacky, but fun.  It really was.  That was very funny. 
[02:05:30]  I should follow that up with a Jim from Taxi impression.  You know, dogs are funny.  It's not a respected sport.  No.  You're right.  And the players aren't highly respected athletes.  They poured this phony respect on the team because of what Imus said.  It's phony.  You ever home on a Sunday, you start flipping around for maybe some sports?  Yeah.  You're just sitting around.  It's like, all right, no golf, no baseball, no football, no NHL. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  And all of a sudden you see like women's basketball, like, and your first thought is, why is this  on?  I, dude, I don't even, is that regular, and then I have to squint to go, oh, it's girls.  It's not even, no, it's not even that.  I keep going like it's a lifetime movie.  Like, it doesn't even register to my eyes to stop for a second.  It's like, why?  Why would I watch this?  I guess some infomercial didn't pay their bill.  They had to do something at the network.  All right, here's Damon talking about women and how they should just cook. 
[02:06:30]  Scene, you all right over there?  I'm good, man.  I'm good.  Let me ask you about this because it says you're a single guy, but you're saying you're having  a hard time settling down with a woman.  I don't believe this.  Come on, Damon.  It's fine.  You are.  Are your expectations are too high?  What are you talking about, Damon?  Well, women today don't, you know, most women that I'm running into don't want to do the  fundamentals.  They don't cook.  What is that?  The fundamentals.  Damon.  It's a joke trying to get a woman.  Why don't I cook?  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Because I make the money so she can make something to cook.  Good.  I like it.  And you hear the, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  No, you didn't.  And that isn't even like saying all women should be in the kitchen or that he, this,  this is his preference.  Yeah.  Whether he's joking or not, his preference would be, I want a girl that, that is my wife  that cooks, cleans, I go and make the money and whatever.  Like that's his preference.  That's my, look.  All right.  I'm an idiot.  That's my preference too.  You want a partner? 
[02:07:30]  Go to a square dance.  You know, I don't, I don't need to join the law firm.  I want, you know, hi honey, I'm home.  I'll kill the big bugs in the kitchen.  You make sure we got dinner.  Wow.  Some people, uh, want other things that, but they can't accept that there are men in this  society, I guess, that just kind of want the old fashioned you cook and I'll bring  home, I'll be the breadwinner.  Why do they have to always defend the female?  Why can't they just enjoy a joke that might be a little, uh, outrageous for, for women? 
[02:08:00]  It's the view.  All right.  Well, the view had this response.  Oh, Barbara, that was a good point.  Joy, what do you have to say?  This is what we hear.  Because I make the money so she can make something to cook.  Don't you, don't you stop.  No, no. 
[02:08:30]  Listen to that.  I don't mind if I love cooking.  Uh-huh.  But listen, but no, no, no, see, no, no, no.  I don't mind if I love paying bills.  What if she makes as much money though?  And then she says you do the cooking.  Then we could talk, but I haven't met her.  You know what I'm saying?  You got a chance to say what he's going to do.  Put him on the spot.  You got to understand, it's about fulfilling basic needs.  Wow.  There you go. 
[02:09:00]  Well, Chris Rock said it too.  He said, do you want your man to come home?  Put a pot on the stove.  Simple as that, right, Robert?  That's it.  And then he had this to say.  Yeah.  Oh, that woman got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep

Honcho  Honcho  Honcho  That's mad  Mad magazine  Nice  That's still made? 
[02:20:00]  I know  It's still funny too  That's a funny magazine  Hey we're gonna go home early today  Because  Today's excuse is this  Today's excuse  We're still going through  Hundreds of hours  Of our old shows  Yeah  That was part of the deal  That we made with  It's our deal  Going back to regular radio  We got all our old tapes back  Yeah  And E-Rock found Marco eating the peach  Yep  So we're gonna play that today  I think starting at what  10.30?  Wow  If you've never heard this bit  It is amazing 
[02:20:30]  One of my favorite bits of all time  We got it  Stay tuned for hilarity  We got it  We're having a gay Marco  Do you know?  Hey  Oh it's terrible  Oh well  What do you think happened to him?  It's been five, six years  I mean  How long was he supposed to last?  He's a flight attendant  No  No he doesn't have the aides  He's a congressman  He's a producer of this show  He's got a wide stance  And he's tapping his foot  But uh  Yeah he's over the top gay  He's uber gay  I think we used to use that term  Remember?  Yes  Uber gay  He's not gay  He's thrilled 
[02:21:00]  He's thrilled  Right  Fabulously gay  He doesn't like cock  He loves it  And uh  I think he wanted NSYNC tickets  I'm not really sure  Yeah it was something like that  Some boy band  I think it was NSYNC  We were able  NSYNC  Okay and we got the tickets  And he said he would do anything  So we said anything?  Alright well you come in  And eat out a girl  And we did this on regular radio  And yeah  Those were the days  Those were the days  And this is like 
[02:21:30]  Thanks Imus  The same  Yeah  This is pretty much  I think  Very similar  To a straight guy  Having to suck a dick  For something  What?  It's  You know  He was so disgusted  By a vagina  Just so completely  Disgusted by it  That it was  It was in the same category  As like  In prison  Where it's like  You will now suck my dick  This guy adores cock  Oh  He adores cock 
[02:22:00]  The way Malcolm X  Describes adoring  Elijah Muhammad  Like  In the Latin sense  Adorare  Meaning to worship  As one would the sun  He feels that way  About the cock  He doesn't  He doesn't enjoy a cock  Or have fun with a cock  He loves it  I love that  Explanation  The explanation  Of uber gay  That is  He came in  He came in  And the girl 
[02:22:30]  Who was the girl  Stalk up  Someone named Wendy  Which means her name  Was Jen  Was it?  Because she was  She wasn't bad  Was she hot?  Do we have pictures?  Being not too bad  I think she was good looking  If I remember correctly  We could not do that  On the radio today  Oh god damn no  Marco was horrified  You'll listen to him  Just as it goes on  And she disrobes  He just freaks out  And goes  What is that? 
[02:23:00]  Like he doesn't even know  What it is  There were a lot of ewes  A lot of ewes  And what's coming out of there  And what is it?  Like he freaks out  He needed a puppet  He needed one of those  He needed a vagina puppet  So people could point things out to him  The vulva  The vulva puppet  And yeah  There was crying involved  Yeah he was crying  The girl got completely naked  And eventually  Gay Marco went down on her  And got his NSYNC tickets  And I believe she described  How god awful he was  At what he was doing  It was just 
[02:23:30]  Because unless there was a cock there  He didn't know what the fuck  Well he probably grabbed the clit  Like it was a small dick  He kept just pretending  It was a Chinese man  And he was tickling  The bottom of the lips  Like they were balls  I'm just going to speculate  I was not in for that  No  No  It's an amazing bit  So we're going to play that  Sometime around 10.30 today  Good because even when we say  We're getting out of here early  We really never do  We never do  Yesterday we were going to  Get out of here early  We got out after 11  So I don't want to hear it  I don't want to hear it  Am I yelling again? 
[02:24:00]  Is it a more Iraq radio?  No  Iraq radio  How was Iraq radio?  I didn't get to listen  Iraq you doing alright yesterday?  Yeah you did great  That's fine  It was alright  He did great  But all the controls  Were covered with a  Garlic butters  He had Jimmy's  Harry Potter bit  Which was  Harry Potter name bit  Oh yeah  I think Jimmy's just jealous  Because Harry Potter  Sold more books than him  Oh my god  How many posts do you have?  You fucking basement jerk off 
[02:24:30]  I think he's just jealous  Shut the fuck up  God almighty you asshole  Enough  Yeah cause Jimmy was actually  Hoping to sell more books  Than Harry Potter  You ass  I'm with you on that one Jimmy  You pretty much know  If you put out a book  When Harry Potter's coming out  That you're probably not  Gonna sell as many  I like Harry Potter  And I don't like him  Pointing me out  For the douchebag  The adult that I really am 
[02:25:00]  I don't think that was  Your first thought  When you put out a book  I don't think it was  You know I think  I got a shot against this lady  Yeah I think I got a shot  Against this kid  Against this rolling broad  Yeah  She's a hack  Smoothie's here  Oh  Alright  Smoothie time  Alright  Alright it's smoothie Thursday  Smoothie Thursday  I hope this is good  Fucking Tim's voice thing  Has got to go  Hey do we have any dumps  In the other show  Can we figure out  What our dumps were  There were two  Two dumps  What were the dumps 
[02:25:30]  Um  816 starring Rob Bartlett  Come sit on my face  And wiggle  Oh that was  Adam Ferrer  Oh wow  You dumped out of my plug  Thanks Adam  Fuck  That was Adam Ferrer  We know that one  And the other one was  The Asian  Of course  The voice  Yeah of course  God fuck  I fucking  Why can't you do that  If you're not doing it hatefully  We didn't say Oriental  Holy fucking shit 
[02:26:00]  Does the world suck  Yeah  Yeah  I agree  Hey  God  Jimmy's just jealous  Because he can't do it  Anything for me  He's a muggle  A muggle  Stupid muggle  Hey uh  Rob have you seen  Two Girls One Cup  I was here  The first time  I was here  He shot us  So why don't we get  Your reaction  He's jerking off  Wait you were here  When we played for who  When you played it for  Bobby 
[02:26:30]  Bobby  Oh Bob Kelly  Bob Kelly  Although I did love you  In Lemon Party  Oh god damn it  Bartlett looks like  Two out of three  Of those guys  Were you kissing guy  I wanted to be  Lucky Devil in the middle  Bob Kelly  I felt so bad for him  He's telling his life stories  Like out of a fucking  Dickens novel  And then you show him  This hard fighting video  Yeah  Awful  Oh there we are  There's a lemon party  That's me on the top  Adam just three men 
[02:27:00]  Come on  Three men having fun  Wait listen  I'm gonna go sit  With the black guys  There's nothing wrong with  Look  There you go  Look at the fun they're having  Hold on let's explain  Cause we got  Oh wow  Maybe we can get an answer  From Adam  We got three very old gentlemen  The one guy looks like  Arnold Palmer  Right  They have to be at least  75 years old  At least  All three of them  Completely naked  You got a guy  Completely on his back  Deep kicking  Deep kissing 
[02:27:30]  A gentleman  And he's running his fingers  Through his gray chest hair  As Arnold Palmer  Is blowing the guy  So the one guy  Is a lucky devil  He's got two things  Going on  Arnold Palmer  Is teeing up that  Cock head  In his mouth  His lips are very red  He has red lips  And he can only get  The head in his old mouth  Because he has  Locked you off  Playing a difficult lie  Off the guy's balls  It's called lemon party  So you got the guy  On his back  Getting blown  And deep kissed  And then you got  One guy that's just 
[02:28:00]  Deep kissing  And then you got  One guy that's just  Blowing  The question I have  For anyone in this studio  We've already tried  To figure it out  Adam of course  And Rob  And of course  Seaton over there  Seaton Smith  Who's the gayest dude  In that picture  The guy blowing him  The guy blowing him  Because not only  Did they make him  Put his cock in his mouth  They also made him  Do that little wisps  Of hair on the top  You see those little  Curl thing he got  Yeah he's doing  A comb over  So he's going to go over  And grab that  And yank his head down  The actual question was  If you had to be somebody  In that picture  Which one would you 
[02:28:30]  Would you be  The guy with the camera  And that was the answer  That's the answer  So it's one of those  Trick questions  And that's the answer  Rob you got it  With the camera  And the best part  And the best part  Of this photo for me  Is the guy on his back  Is getting sucked  And he still has  His watch on  Is the guy blowing him  With his liver spotted hand  Is holding his leg  Almost like in case  The guy starts bucking  His older gentleman  Cock into his mouth  He can hang on  And not have it pop out  Because there's nothing worse  Than when a cock  Pops out of your mouth 
[02:29:00]  While you're enjoying it  That guy is not enjoying  His friend's cock  And his nose is dangerously  Close to Kissing Man  Too if you notice  Oh yeah  So  He might be pulling  The old switch  Yeah I was going to say  He's got a mouthful  And a noseful  Wow  Kissing Man is running  His hand over the nipple  Of the one gentleman  And he's actually  Going to move it down  Farther  And pump the other cock  Into Red Lips mouth  Into old 
[02:29:30]  Grapefruit lips  That's his nickname  On the golf course  They call him  Grapefruit lips  You know here's the thing  They're really just  Experimenting  With their sexuality  Nah  They're not  They've got it down  That room just smells like  Ass and aqua velva  There's a lot of  High karate going on  High karate  Karate  I love the fact  That it's such a plain room  There's nothing on the walls  It's just a room  That they have set aside  So they can go in there  And suck each other's  Old cucks 
[02:30:00]  I love the fact  That they're all like  Four or five different colors  What's up with that y'all  Yeah yeah look at that  Like they've got a farmer's tan  Why is his dick darker  Than like his stomach  Do you know  I just noticed  Kissing guy's dick out  Yeah right over there  I never  Laying like a sniper  Are you kidding  Noticed kissing guy's dick  Oh god  So the sucker  The guy sucking  Who has a gut by the way  Which is why he's laying there  I can see his fault  It's unattractive  Is holding the other guy's cock  And fucking kisser  Is like hey how about my cock 
[02:30:30]  So he's easing it up  Onto the leg of the guy  On his back  Towards Ruby Lips' mouth  I never noticed that dick  Let's call him Arnold Palmer  Arnold Palmer  I think is gonna go over  And suck Perry White's dick  Any minute  While Ed Koch  Just lays down  Perry White  And the guy  Great Caesar's ghost  Let's call him  Old dog dick  It's a red tip  Old dog dick  Thurston Howell 
[02:31:00]  Dog dick  It looks like a shiitake mushroom  It's horrible  Lemon party  Fucking rules  What a fun place  You can really just  Let's go to a lemon party  Oh my god  You can really just  Dissect the whole picture  For hours  No I don't get the whole  Lemon party  This is what  You know  What they used to  Freshen their breath afterwards  I don't know why  They call it that  Cause it's so  It's nothing like a lemon party  So you go there  But who's the gayest dude there  The gayest dude  Probably the guy's sick one  I never knew he had a fuck 
[02:31:30]  He had a fucking  He has a cock actually  Waiting  It's the guy kissing  Because his eyes are closed  Like he's passionately in love  With this kissing  Even all this other stuff  Is happening  Or he could be pretending  It's somebody else  But the fact that he's teasing  The hairy nipple  Does show he's a fruit  And he has hairy arms  There's a lot of problems  With this photo obviously  But the open mouth kissing thing  Is a little  A little much  Well the guy at the bottom  Doesn't seem as into it  He's just kissing to be polite  So he can keep getting  His dick sucked  The kisser and the sucker  Are friends  And they're double teaming this guy 
[02:32:00]  I'll bet you there are a couple  Like let's pull a train  On fucking Koch  Oh there'll be a rotisserie  A couple seconds after this  There's definitely a rotisserie  Going on  In those soft old movies  Let's get  Let's get the aqua dots  And go over to see Barney  I wish this was a movie  So bad  I want to see what happens next  Which one of them  Shits the bed  And they have to stop shooting  I bet you it's kissing guy  Because he's angry  That no one will pay attention to him  Because he has psoriasis  On his balls  So he just  Passive aggressively  Shits the bed  And says sorry 
[02:32:30]  You think he just  Splashes one out  On the back wall  Look at that blue wall  Well here's the big surprise  The guy on top  Has a colostomy  So it's going to be  A little bit of colostomy  That could hurt  Let's say hi to Ben in Iowa  Ben  Hey what's up dudes  What's up Ben  You love the show  I need to know homo  Right now  Or I'm getting  My subscription  Oh yeah  Alright then we gotta get  Adam's reaction  To two girls one cup  Alright we'll go to  Two girls one cup  Adam have you ever seen this  Why is this  Every time I'm in the studio  We do this  Which one  Cause it's delicious

[02:37:30]  Yeah, there you go  Bad stuff  I want to know  I'm so amazed that that gets you hard  It does  That's awful  That's fascinating to me  No, he was thinking of something else  Yeah  He was still thinking about Lemon Party  I don't mind  No, I wasn't  What?  Lemon Party doesn't turn me on  Oh  No  No  No set up  I don't know why they're there  Did the guy in the bottom finally get his dick sucked?  What happened with these guys?  It's like when you watch The Wanderers  You want to know if the Port and Baldies  Actually went into the military  Tara? 
[02:38:00]  Why are you only sucking his cock, Tara?  Someone said punch in Lemon Party on YouTube  And maybe there's a little more  Oh, I hope so  We'll go back to that  Lemon Party  I want to just hang out with those guys  At a function  Oh, I'm sure they'd like you to come along  No, no, but I mean at a function  Where they're all wearing ties  I don't know why  Go to the Senate  Here's a fine story coming in  About a drug deal gone bad  It happened at this home  Near the SIUE campus  Authorities said three people went here  To buy $400 worth of marijuana  Instead, two of the people stole the drugs 
[02:38:30]  And ran, leaving a 19-year-old behind  The offenders  Began to  Torture, I guess you'd say  And beat  The victim  He said 23-year-old  Rosario James  And 20-year-old  Jordan Salas  Tortured the 19-year-old  Trying to get their drug money  It started out with hot cookies  That were baking in the oven  Too hot to touch  But not too hot to injure  They were extremely hot  And several of them  Were placed on the victim's  Shoulder and chest 
[02:39:00]  Burning him severely  So hot they cause  Second degree burns  The injuries sustained by the victim  Were serious  Yet delicious  He's serious  He's been downgraded to yummy  You had to play that  After that shit video  Guantanamo Bay  Is just thinking about  Using the cookie treatment  Yeah  Screw that waterboarding crap  That isn't quite  The shower scene  From Scarface  With the chainsaw 
[02:39:30]  You know  Not quite  Boy what scumbags  They took the drugs  And ditched the third guy  Is that what happened  Ditched him  They left a 19-year-old behind  It sounds like  They grabbed the drugs  Hot cookies for you  You want some cookies Frank  They're going to do it  In Guantanamo Bay  But the cookies  Are all going to be shaped  Like working happy women  Nothing  No  Trying to be clever  And I just bored everybody  You think I care  What Betty Crocker says  Mrs. Spears 
[02:40:00]  Can suck my car  Because famous  Amos says so  Say hello to my  Snickerdoodles  Fuck  They're fucking  Atheman brothers  I'm not going to  Shoot these  Kibler elves  Manolo  You shoot these  Fucking Kibler elves  Fucking fry  Half a fox  Oh for a chipwitch  I'm going to  Carve him up  Real nice  Say hello 
[02:40:30]  To my little  Lornadoo  Yeah right  Cookie jokes  All right  Yeah well  They continued to  Torture the kid  But the torture  Was just beginning  Oh no  Detectives said  The suspects  Used a fraternity  Type paddle  To strike the teen  Some 15 times  On his backside  Then they gave him  A haircut  That couldn't have  Been a good haircut  And a wet willy  And an Indian bird  Yeah what immature  Drug dealers  I know  Then they went 
[02:41:00]  With the cookies  I don't know  What do you want  To do next  I don't know  Let's paddle them  Then they went  And he confessed  And a horrible  Finale to the torture  They wrote dick  On his head  And sent him off  Where he fell asleep  And they took photos  With their penis  By his face  They made me carry  A marshmallow  In my butt  Lingalonga  Fucking Rob's  Getting too comfortable  In here  I figure it's  My last time  Yeah  Yeah no more  Mr. Nice Guy 
[02:41:30]  You have nothing  To lose now  I hate this  Backside  Then they gave him  A haircut  They had electric clippers  His hair was maybe  Two, three inches long  And they cut it  To the skin  Just in a zigzag pattern  On his head  And finally  Authorities revealed  The two suspects  Poured a bottle of urine  Over the victim's head  James and Salas  Are enrolled at SIUE  And their fellow students  Were stunned  By the charges  I think that's a horrible situation

[02:53:30]  Moral sex on him  Yes  You can lick  And kiss  And suck  And do whatever you like  I love him  And do that up the shaft  Of the penis  And along the side  And around to his testicles  And then you take  Just the head  Of his penis  In your mouth  That's all  Open their mouth real wide  And shove that in  And you drool  Great quantities of saliva  Down the shaft of his penis  What a great blowjob technique  Holy crap  Grip the penis  Very gently with your hands 
[02:54:00]  I'm thinking maybe a little butt sack  Then let him use the dildo  Put it in  Pull it out  How'd you like hitting your shitter?  I like to lick ass  This is great  It's not gay if you're single  You two homos  Know a lot about sucking dick  You got it down to the science  It sounds like  It's the Opie and Anthony show  All right  Back at XM Satellite Radio  Fuck  Some of us are  All right 
[02:54:30]  We got to the bottom  Of the Marco controversy  It has been played on XM  But a very short version  That Rick cut up  Back in the day  Oh what was it?  Ew  And was able to sneak out  Back in the day  But this is a much longer version  With the set up  And everything  It's the full version  Of Marco  Eating the peach  So this will definitely be  A lot of new material  Right Iraq?  Did I explain it right?  Yeah  What's wrong Jimmy? 
[02:55:00]  I just bent over  And I felt my  Fucking stomach  On my dick  Did you really?  That was mine  But Jimmy  You got beauty marks though  I'm covered with them  Really?

[02:55:30]  Something to the radio show  Seton's  Very happy with this  I will explain what happened  There's a guy  That lives in D.C.  Saw two crackheads  Fucking behind  In his back alley  And instead of  I don't know  Doing something decent  He decided to take  A slideshow picture of it  Wow  That man's name  Is Larry Craig  So it's a  It's a big black dude  And that's a white guy too?  It's a white  You think it's a girl  But it's actually transvestite  And you can see  In the next to last slide picture  I think one of his balls  Was hanging out  Wait, wait, wait  The head of that guy 
[02:56:00]  Excuse me  The head of that guy's dick  Is poking out  Yeah  Is that  Holy fuck  You can see it on my screen  Look at that  It's right there  That's like coming  Out his side  It looks like  What are you looking at?  Right here  That's his dick?  That  No, it's a touchy roll  What the fuck  You think  It's a radiated cap  It's like dick sucking  And then slash  Crack breaks  So this guy put  A slideshow together  Of the whole action  Going down  Yeah  You want to explain 
[02:56:30]  The pictures  One by one here?  Sure, sure  And that's him  Getting his crack  From picture number two  After the head  He decided to take  A little smoke break  Which is smoke of crack  Wait, wait, wait  Let's start from the beginning  Let's start from the beginning  I'm not supposed to jerk off to this  Without the story  Alright, here's the first picture  Explain what's going on  Alright, what happened was  Two guys looked out the window  And saw these two guys  Hurry up  Got a camera  Now there is a  A white  Right now we don't know  If it's a guy or a girl  A white guy  And there's a black guy  Getting his dick sucked  By this he-she right now 
[02:57:00]  And the black guy is standing  Well, okay, good point  My bad  He's actually at the precipice  Of the lips  Waiting for the entrance  And that black guy  Has linebacker thighs  Yes  He has those  Emmett Smith  Oof  Alright, the next picture  I used to play football  Before the crack  Kind of died  Now, alright  I guess the dick sucking  Has occurred  He's taking a break  He's like  I need my crack first  I guess there was a negotiation  He's now put his dick  Back into his drawers  Just to stretch it  I don't know why  It's barely fitting  It's barely fitting  Alright, next slide 
[02:57:30]  And wait, wait  And the white guy  Oh, the white guy  Smoking the crack  Hitting the head crack  Now, this picture  Is fabulous  Because this is where  I feel the drama happens  The he-she gets up  Takes off his diaper  Oh, Jesus  Now, I had to figure out  Why is this man  Wearing a diaper  Let me explain  Now, in the comments page  Down there  People have seen  This person around  This person has been  Fucked up the ass  So many times  Unlubricated  That you get  An anal discharge 
[02:58:00]  Apparently  So just like  Shit falls out  Of his ass  Shit is just falling out  He cannot control  So he has a diaper now  Now, he's taking  The diaper off  So black guy  Can fuck him  Is it the black guy's  Rod sticking up?  Yes  So black guy  Can fuck him  Spence  With a tremendous  Copic  This looks like  A fence post  That black guy  Is very excited  By the old  Fucking shit ass  Now, in this picture  This is kind of just sad  Now, you just noticed  The man took his diaper off  Now black guy 
[02:58:30]  Is now sticking his finger  In the white guy's ass  Right now  You also can kind of  See the man's balls  Right now  Kind of, sort of  That's love  I'm guessing he's  Spent his hand  And white crack dude  Is bending over  Getting ready for  Yes, he's probably  Smoking crack  While the man's  Getting ready for  The black guy's  Getting ready for  Crack now, too  He's kicking  Holy shit  This is gonna be like  Watching that horse video  Oh, my God  Holy shit  You can see the balls  Are incredibly red  Alright, explain  In this picture, man  Yeah, white guy  Now big old completely

[02:59:30]  It's like the middle of the day  The day is very, very bright  It's outside  The lighting is excellent  Alright, next slide  Oh, no  This is nice  Now, this part  Needs to be explained  Because  Wait  Hold on, hold on  Hold on  Explain the picture  Explain now  The guys taking the picture  Were laughing so hard  That they  I think they bumped  They tapped the window  That they would take  The picture through  And so the tap of the window  The guy looked up  And was like  What's that look  But his face right now  Is that look of 
[03:00:00]  I'm fucking  What the hell are you doing  And his lips are just  So largely just  Yeah, he's  I can't think of a  Better word than  Niggerish right now  I'm sorry  He's just hanging out  He's just like  What's happening right now  And he's uh  But he has not stopped  Fucking by the way  No  And the other guy  The white guy's bent over  And there's like a little  Crink in his upper thigh  He's a very skinny guy  And you can tell  He has taken a deep dick in  Yeah  He's taken a deep dick in  Good boy  Yeah  Yeah, all the muscles  Are tensed up now  He's feeling that  His face is red
