<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The final Opie and Anthony Show from their then-current studio was a momentous occasion, marked by a large gathering of fans outside, despite rainy conditions, some having arrived as early as 3 AM.  Intern David conducted numerous confrontational on-the-street interviews, notably clashing with a fan named "Dick." One fan gifted Anthony a "Flip Shots" shot glass game, which was universally panned.  Inside, the broadcast featured the giveaway of old radio cart tapes containing potentially offensive audio from the show's history.  In-studio personalities included Bobo, Drew Boogie, and E-Rock.  A listener called in offering Bobo Mets workout tickets.  The hosts discussed the new Citi Field, comparing it unfavorably to older stadiums and criticizing its cost.  They also briefly covered a hoax about lights in the New Jersey sky, later identified as flares from balloons.

A significant portion of the show focused on professional wrestling, specifically WrestleMania, The Undertaker's undefeated streak, and various wrestlers' finishing moves.  Sam, a frequent caller, displayed encyclopedic knowledge of wrestling moves, detailing the techniques and effectiveness of moves performed by the Bushwhackers, Coco Beware, Superfly, Scott Steiner, Big Boss Man, Macho Man Randy Savage, Roddy Piper, Greg Valentine, Ric Flair, Dr. D David Schultz, Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Kurt Angle, and Triple H.  The hosts and Sam's discussion included humorous commentary and exaggerated reactions, often using offensive language to describe the wrestlers and their moves.  The segment also included jokes about Def Leppard's drummer, Rick Allen, and his single arm.

The conversation then shifted to the large in-studio audience.  The hosts commented on the crowd size, reminisced about a previous guest in a bear suit, and joked about removing the regular, Big A, due to space limitations.  They also promoted upcoming events and a prize giveaway featuring a photo of Big A and Stonker Patty.  The segment concluded with Drew Boogie's arrival in the studio.  The entire broadcast centered on the impending move to SiriusXM,  the significant fan support demonstrated by the large outdoor crowd, and a mix of humorous discussions and wrestling-related segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opian Anthony, controversial radio personalities, Opian Anthony.  I've been dealing with a twisted testicle. 
[00:04:00]  She wrote out a prescription that basically said warm baths to let them float.  They would look like alligator eyes popping out of the water.  Notice the best show on TV.  I think it's called Three Sheets.  Where Anthony is in relation to the wind when he's driving.  I have a red light in my bathroom.  Wow.  We're showering with a chick when you have a red light.  You're always thinking of how you can look a little better. 
[00:04:30]  Exactly.  So I have a blindfold.  I had to go and she comes in.  The Opie and Anthony radio show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, you got that right.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The last show from this facility.  That's it.  Which has taken on a life of its own, Anthony.  Another moment in history. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, I was just counting in my head.  I think this is the fifth studio we've done the show from.  Is it?  Really?  B-A-B-A-F-N-E-W-X-M-K-Rock.  Yeah.  We're moving on to our sixth studio.  Wow.  We need some stability in our careers.  That'll never happen.  But this thing is taking on a life of its own.  We kind of started just talking about how we're moving.  And it has become this thing.  I mean, we're all getting emails from listeners. 
[00:05:30]  They're flying in from all over the country.  Yeah.  Like the hardcores are, you know, they flew in last night.  Flying in this morning.  Crazy.  Just to take one last peek of this joint before we take a week off.  And then start at SiriusXM in about a week.  A week from Monday, right?  Yeah.  So it's supposed to be.  And we pulled up separately, whatever, and wow, the line.  Yeah, there was a line of people outside standing in the rain. 
[00:06:00]  Crazy.  Yeah.  There was like 40 or 50 people when I showed up.  There has to be more than that now.  We're going to shove as many people in here as possible, so.  I came whipping around a cab and the roads were all wet.  I thought I was going to slide right into the crowd.  Imagine.  Would have been great.  Shock jock kills fans waiting outside.  Surprisingly, he wasn't drunk.  Sorry.  At this hour?  Try me at 7.  Oh, really?  No.  Really?  David and Sam, we should get right into bits. 
[00:06:30]  David.  It's all about bits.  Sam took it upon himself and said, you know what?  Big crowd outside.  I'm going down there with David.  Oh, wow.  So you did a quick impromptu what's the haps?  Yeah, kind of, but I let David take the reins on this one.  He wanted to get to know the fans.  Very generous of you.  All right, let's jump right into it as we set up the studio.  I see Drew Boogie's setting up.  I see that E-Rock is getting the rest of the stuff from our office to give away to the fans today. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  Today's the big get, right, E-Rock?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That sounded like the Kool-Aid man.  Oh, yeah.  That didn't sound promising.  No.  Hey, what's in those white bags, Eric?  Oh, that's a surprise for the listeners.  Oh, cool.  Oh, cool.  Oh, nice.  Hope it's rat poisons.  I was just going to say cyanide.  Intern David meets Dick, who puts David in a bad mood.  Oh, so early. 
[00:07:30]  Hello, this is Intern David, and we're right outside of the XM Studios right now.  It's 520 in the morning.  There are already 26 fans outside, and even though they know they can't get up until upstairs,  so 630 in the morning, and we're with one of the fans right now.  What's your name, sir?  Dick.  What time did you arrive outside here?  About 5 o'clock.  You got here at 5 o'clock?  Do you know it's dark out here?  No shit, David.  It's 5 o'clock.  I see that.  It's also raining.  Why are you standing out here in the pouring rain? 
[00:08:00]  It's not pouring rain, Dickless.  Why are you being so rude to me?  It's just the reputation that you carry along.  I just have this overwhelming need to feel like to just be a complete dick to you.  That's not very nice.  Oh, I think this interview's over.  You want to talk to him?  No.  David, honestly, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.  Okay, thank you.  Big fan.  Okay, thank you.  Big fan, he says.  Yeah, okay.  And, wow, I'm just so early. 
[00:08:30]  The celebrity's already coming in.  Yeah?  I see Bobo sitting on the couch.  Wow, look, he gets right up.  Bobo is all decked out in his Mets regalia.  Yeah.  Do you want to throw up?  City field, I guess.  Yep.  Starting the festivities today.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  Are you going today?  No, I'm not going today.  Why not?  I don't have tickets.  Oh.  We couldn't have figured that out. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, someone should get Bobo a ticket for the big opening of city field.  Buy him a $12 Pepsi porch ticket.  Pepsi porch ticket.  Danny's going to buy you a $12 Pepsi porch, it's called, ticket.  Well, there's a whole bunch of different, I'm looking at the different seating that they  have right now.  I can think of another name for that that might be funny.  For only certain people can sit.  This place is going to be sold out today for a preseason game, I'm thinking.  Yeah, it's a charity game versus the Red Sox. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, really?  I didn't even know that.  Yeah, me either.  All right.  Charity.  Bobo, we'll try to get you a ticket, all right?  All right.  All right, thank you.  You want to throw out the first Bobo Springsteen?  Sure, no problem.  You got something in mind?  All right, I got something.  This one I'm dedicating to Jimbo, who's not from Jersey, but he lives in Jersey.  Jimbo, he knows how to rock.  You always hear him in worst-up mode. 
[00:10:00]  He does an excellent Joe Pesci, and he lives in Jersey.  And David just tickled pink.  We were only going to do one, but I just found out that Drew Boogie, our own Drew Boogie,  is from Jersey, right?  You live in Jersey?  What town there, Drew?  Lodi.  Lodi.  Lodi, Bobo.  Drew Boogie.  Drew Boogie, he's a DJ.  He has an excellent CD that I plan on ordering, and his remixes are funny as heck. 
[00:10:30]  He's from Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Funny as heck.  Funny as heck.  Good one, Nana.  Nice.  All right, we'll get back to Bobo in a minute, too.  Starting to let the listeners up.  I could hear the metal detectors.  You hear that in the background?  Yeah, is that what that is?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  This is airport security, man.  Wow.  Only the best for us.  Intern David meets Rob on the street, who's first online to see the show today, the last  show from this facility.  This is Intern David, and I'm here with another fan who's waiting in the pouring rain at 520  in the morning.  What's your name, sir?  My name's Rob, and it's not really pouring rain yet.  But it's still raining, and you're still standing in the rain getting wet.  Yes.  Yes, I am.  What time did you arrive here outside to wait to get inside?  Uh, I got here maybe about 10 after 3.  10 after 3? 
[00:11:30]  Were there any other people waiting out here when you got here?  Uh, no.  I was the first.  How does that make you feel, to be first in line out of all these fans?  Do you feel a sense of pride?  Yes, I do.  I have a raging heart on at the moment.  Would you like to feel?  No, I wouldn't like to feel.  That's disgusting.  But I'm circumcised.  Me too, man.  Me too.  David.  David is the worst.  He is the worst, but what are you saying there?  I mean, the guy was first on line.  Yeah, I was yelling because he goes, was there anybody here when you got here? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  But he's talking to the guy who was first on line.  Yeah.  He was first on line.  What time did you get here?  A little left at 3.  He's like, oh, was anyone here when you got here?  Yeah.  I killed him and threw him into the construction site.  Yeah, because I had to be first.  Jesus.  Intern David gives Rob a dose of reality.  Who's Rob?  I was the same guy.  Same guy.  Okay.  Do you think by getting here at 3 in the morning that you would somehow get into the studio  before everybody else?  I was kind of hoping to, yes.  It's not like that at all. 
[00:12:30]  We'll just take as many people as can get in, and once it's filled, no one will be able  to get in.  If you were like...  That's not true, David.  Jesus Christ.  It's because people are panicking.  They're listening to this right now as they try to get to the studio as fast as possible.  We're going to try to make accommodations for everybody that shows up.  We might have to tell people, beat it.  We've got to get some new people up here.  But we're going to try to get everyone a little peek.  Yeah.  Shove them all in.  Of the exciting last show from this facility.  Is it any type of milestone, really? 
[00:13:00]  No.  But we have prizes.  Yeah, we do.  I see.  Wow.  Yeah.  I see.  Are those carts?  Yeah, those are your old carts.  What?  Really?  Whoa.  What's on the carts?  I'd love to know what some of the carts are.  Let's see.  These memories.  Oh, remember the sound of these things slapping into the machine?  Yeah.  That's the sound.  The old cart sound.  You've got the Sharpton Traffic music.  Oh. 
[00:13:30]  Stoner Spelling Bee, thanks for playing.  All right.  Mayberry Chainsaw.  Oh, that was a hack song.  Wow.  Just because my name was Opie, I found this dumb song and I played it every once in a while.  Jesus Christ.  Where did you get this shit from?  Thank God it's on cart and we don't have cart players anymore.  No kidding.  Cuban Drown.  Ah.  One of my favorite song parodies.  Yeah.  The Reverend Al song.  Uh-huh.  The actual Reverend Al song on cart.  On the cart.  Still get mileage out of that one every so often when Al's in the news. 
[00:14:00]  The NBC Nightly News theme.  On a cart.  Very good.  On a cart.  That was for the Tom Broken Jaw or Brokaw, whatever.  Pipe song.  Let's go get the pipe.  Oh, the pipe, right.  The Joe song.  The Charlton Heston Traffic Bed.  Wow.  There it was.  On cart.  I mean, this is pieces of history here and people are going to get to go home with them.  That's mostly NAW stuff.  That's probably all WNAW stuff.  Yeah.  So that's for the people that have been with us a long time.  Stopped using cart machines. 
[00:14:30]  Any other good carts over there, Iraq?  There's tons of them.  Yeah, but I want to.  Oh, I want to know what these are.  Yeah, for the older listeners, this is bringing back memories.  Old Dirty spells inebriated.  Inubriated.  Inubriated.  Inubriated.  Road Rage.  Road Rage.  What's that?  I don't know.  I must be driving.  Burt Ward ID.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  That would be Robin.  South Park Opie and Anthony song. 
[00:15:00]  Uh-huh.  The Schlong song.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  All the names for your dick.  And Cry Baby.  Oh, that's just a baby crying, right?  Baby crying.  A little sound effect.  I used to play that when someone started bitching and moaning about things.  Yeah.  That was very insulting.  Very demeaning.  All right.  Let's go back to David.  So David gives Rob a dose of reality.  Phil, no one will be able to get in.  If you were like 20th in line, you still would probably get in.  You know that, right?  Probably, yeah.  But then I wouldn't be first in line. 
[00:15:30]  So why is that such a big deal to you to be first in line?  Um, well, like I said, it gives me a raging hard-on.  What did you do when you got here at 3 o'clock in the morning?  Did you just stand here and smoke cigarettes all morning?  No, there's a little wet spot over there where I actually had to relieve myself once already.  Oh, that's disgusting, man.  Oh.  Should be a good show, man.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, David.  You made my day.  Oh, my God.  Uh, moving on. 
[00:16:00]  Intern David meets Tom, who brought a gift.  Yes.  Who's Tom?  Tom is, I don't think he's up here yet, but he brought a gift for Anthony, which David assessed.  Okay.  Hello, it's Intern David.  It's 5.30 in the morning, and we're still interviewing all the fans.  They keep on coming in by the numbers, waiting outside in the pouring rain and the dark.  And we're here with one fan who is showing Intern Paul something that he brought for Anthony.  What's your name, sir?  Tom Carpenito.  What exactly?  You're showing Intern Paul something.  What exactly are you showing him right now?  It's called Flip Shots. 
[00:16:30]  It's where you line up four or five people on a board, or actually as many as you want,  and you, these glasses magnetize to the board, and you do shots simultaneously.  Why do you have that with you?  I brought it for Anthony, his new bar he's building at his home.  What do you think about that?  Do you think that's a nice gift?  Do you think Anthony might enjoy it?  I think he will.  A lot of fun.  I don't know.  I don't think he's going to enjoy it so much.  What if we put a, we give him a five-shooter I got for him.  He's in the middle, two blondes, two brunettes on each side, do a shot together with his, 
[00:17:00]  what does he like, Jack Daniels?  He doesn't like that, no.  You can't come up until 6.15, so I think the president will have to wait a little bit.  Okay, you got it.  Jesus.  Sometimes David just decides to be nasty to people.  Yeah, he certainly was there.  Well, he's taking it out of him because of Dick.  Yeah.  The first guy he talked to.  Yeah, Dick got him all wound up.  What is the flip shot thing?  I don't get it.  It's like, it's like a board.  It's like a wooden board with magnets in it. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  And then each shot glass has a magnet.  So the shot glasses stick to the board, you fill them up, and then you line people up,  and you all take the shot at the same time.  Oh, you lift the board up like this?  Yeah, like all five of you.  Why can't you just pour out five shots and each go, hey, and do the shot?  No, this is on a board.  It's on a wooden board.  What happened to the one, two, three?  Go.  See, that's what you want, a magnet holding the thing on there.  See, it's a...  Yeah.  Oh, you got one?  But it's a classy joint I got.  Danny, what do you got there? 
[00:18:00]  That's it.  That's the...  This is flip shots.  That's flip shots.  Oh, you know flip shots, huh?  No.  And Danny tended bar.  I did.  I never heard of this fucking thing.  This guy must work for fucking flipshots.com.  Yeah.  Do the glasses actually stick to the board?  Let's see.  There's a magnet.  I see.  Let's see how well they stick or if it would just slide off.  They'll probably stick, but...  They stick pretty good.  I hear them sticking. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, man.  That looks like fun.  You want to do a shot there, Sam?  For sure.  And then you would tip that over and...  Yeah, five of you, though.  You could do it with some girls.  Two blondes, two brunettes.  Yeah, huh?  There you go.  That's right.  You get the chicks and girls.  Tip it over sideways and see if they fall off.  No, they ain't gonna fall off.  Where's your fifth one in there, Danny?  Well, we should fill them up, though, I guess.  What happened to the fifth one?  That's a board that only has four?  There's four.  I think the fifth one's in the middle, but...  Ah, you might as well bring it to your bar and just leave it on the side. 
[00:19:00]  Maybe you have fun.  Smack someone over the head with it.  There you go.  How could you ever have fun with that now that I think about it?  You can't.  No.  It's the opposite of fun.  I just would have fancy shot glasses.  Yeah, just do a fancy shot.  One, two, three, boom.  You could have shenanigans like that going on in my house.  If there's five of you, though.  Then you just line up five shot glasses.  You fill them up.  Not on the board.  On the bar.  And then you grab them.  What's next?  Flaming Sambuca or flaming fucking 151 shots?  Well, you can see on the edges. 
[00:19:30]  The bar burned the whole fucking place down.  It's tapered like an oar almost.  Probably someone could hold it.  Isn't it tapered?  Yeah, so it looks like the person on each end has to hold it.  Yeah.  And kind of tip it towards everyone's.  I imagine that's going to be a lot of spillage on people's clothes.  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't need spillage.  Yeah, the two people aren't going to be able to coordinate the tipping over of the board correctly.  Didn't get that bar at Ikea.  So I guess David was right. 
[00:20:00]  Gift sucks.  Gift sucks.  Gift sucks.  Very nice.  Guy's going to be all disappointed when he comes up.  I think as far as bar gifts go, that could be the worst thing I've ever seen given to anybody alcohol related.  I can't think of anything worse.  It is.  I don't even.  No one's ever heard of it.  You're giving away an XM boom box today?  We've got radios and stuff too.  That fucking white one.  We got that from Logan.  I think we got that in 1993.  Wow.  I brought mine home.  That thing rocks.  That boom box.  You can move that all over the house.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  As long as you got some, you know, clearage to the satellite.  Yeah.  Finally, Intern David meets Joey who tried to come up early.  This is Intern David and I'm here with another fan that's waiting in the pouring rain and dark at 5.30 in the morning.  What's your name, sir?  Joey.  What time did you get here to the XM studio?  About 20 minutes ago.  And when you got here, what did you proceed to do?  Say shit a bunch of times because I didn't think there was going to be anybody here. 
[00:21:00]  What did you do?  You didn't stand in the line with all the other fans, did you?  No, I tried to sign in early and it didn't happen.  What made you think that you had the right to sign in and go upstairs before the studio, into the studio, before the show started, before any other fan was able to go upstairs?  Quite frankly, because I'm the shit.  And what makes you the shit?  I play bass in an insanely good band and that's pretty much it.  I don't think you're the shit.  If you were the shit, you would know not to try to sneak into the studio.  That's not a very appropriate thing to do.  You're not the shit at all. 
[00:21:30]  Wow, I just completely got served by David.  I feel like a shithead right now.  You are a shithead.  This has been intern David.  Thank you so much.  Jesus, David.  David doesn't like the fans.  Why don't you like the fans, David?  That guy was out of line trying to sneak into the studio before everybody else.  He wasn't going to be successful with that.  Kenny's like a freaking hawk.  Oh, yeah.  Kenny's on high alert.  Look at him just pacing out there.  You know what it is?  It's David's only chance to get back at people, to let the shit roll downhill from him. 
[00:22:00]  He gets shit on every day when he's in here, so it's his time to give a little shit back.  That's why he acts like a maniac on Facebook.  That's right.  Some good shit there.  Oh, you're sorting through the...  I'm keeping one thing only.  What are you keeping?  It's an autographed Def Leppard CD.  I wouldn't mind having that.  Oh.  But all this stuff, E-Rock, there's a bunch of signed stuff there, which is fine to give  away, but I thought that was all for charity.  Eric.  Yeah, we never did the charity. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, this is charity.  The charity is our listeners.  Yeah, well, neither company wanted to help us set the thing up, so I've got tired of waiting.  We've had this stuff for almost two years.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Oh, well, then I'm going to have to sort through that and see if there's anything I want.  It is amazing, though, because we were trying to do the right thing, raise some money  for something.  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock collected autographs for well over a year, year and a half, and we wanted  to do some huge charity thing, and no one could help us organize it.  Yeah.  So.  Bastards.  So now the listeners get them today. 
[00:23:00]  Really good stuff today.  Except for that one.  I'm keeping that one.  I don't blame you.  There's a bunch of them, though.  That's yours.  Yeah.  You keep that.  What's his name have to...  The guy who lost his arm.  Rick Allen.  Rick Allen, thank you.  Was he...  Did he have to, like, figure out how to write a different way?  I don't know if he lost his writing hand.  You'd hope not.  That's...  Writing, jerking off.  It's all out the window.  You just said it very easy.  I was trying to, like, say exactly what you just said.  Still early.  Let's go to Rob in Staten Island. 
[00:23:30]  Rob.  Yeah, hi.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I called last Friday.  I left my number for Bobo, and I guess nobody gave it to him.  I had two tickets to tonight's game to give to him, and I never got a phone call back,  but, you know, right now I got Sunday's workout, if you want, so I'd give them to him.  Sunday's workout?  Sunday's workout.  Yeah, they have a workout at the stadium on Sunday morning, you know, and you just get  to go in and see the guys work out and stuff, you know, for a couple hours.  All right, I'll take those tickets, so what's the phone number? 
[00:24:00]  How do I get the tickets?  Well, don't give that out on the air.  That would be, you know...  What's wrong with you, Bobo?  No, it's on the air.  You're kidding.  Hold on, Rob.  Okay.  All right.  There you go.  Bobo, you got tickets to the Mets doing calisthenics.  Congratulations.  Watching them, yeah.  Batting practice.  All right, someone get me all the information.  Yes, for a matter.  Can I just pick up the tickets?  Yes. 
[00:24:30]  Don't you worry.  We'll get all the info Bobo needs.  Yeah, we're doing that now, Bobo.  The Yankees did that yesterday.  Thank you.  The Yankees did a workout session, right?  Yeah, yeah, at their new field.  It's been all over the news today.  Big New York story, I guess.  You know, both teams going to their respective parks for the first time, saying that it's,  you know, they're the best parks ever.  Well, they have to be.  They have to be.  They're the newest parks.  And the locker room facilities and the gyms in there and all their little therapeutic 
[00:25:00]  stations and everything like that.  Just supposed to be amazing.  They'll be the best parks ever until the next stadium is built, which is, who's next as  far as new stadiums go?  They should announce that the Yankees are building a new stadium and just start building  one and knock this new one down.  Oh, my God.  Just complete.  Total waste of money.  Every year, a new one.  Every year.  A new stadium every year.  Until the city is completely broke and run down. 
[00:25:30]  Out of gold.  Out of solid gold.  Yes.  Gold bricks from Fort Knox.  You think that would piss off the rest of the world?  It would be so great.  The world would be like, what is wrong with them?  I hope the Yankees wind up in fourth place this year, too, because usually you win a championship  or you do great when you have a new stadium.  It revitalizes a team or reinvigorates a team.  There's a lot of excitement in the air.  Oh, I hope they're fucking terrible.  I'll tell you what.  That's Citi Field.  I think I'm going to start going to Mets games again. 
[00:26:00]  I hate it.  Shea sucked a dick.  I hated going there.  Shea was just an awful stadium.  Right.  Citi Field looks pretty cool.  They're just showing them on the news over and over again.  Coming up, deadliest catch.  Team Bandit.  They're still doing the deadliest catch thing.  It's not that deadly if they're in season six or seven.  It's like inconvenient catch now.  It's like, I kind of hurt myself a little bit.  Catch. 
[00:26:30]  You know that the Orioles, that was the stadium that changed everything, right?  Yeah.  Camden Yards.  Camden Yards.  Guess how many years ago?  Oh, boy.  This is a nice little fun fact.  30 years.  No, man.  15?  Yeah, Jimmy's about right.  17 years ago, 1992.  Since then, 19 new Major League Baseball parks have opened.  Because that was like a retro one that had a piece of old Yankee Stadium, the same vibe.  Yeah.  And just people loved it.  And they all pretty much copied that design after that. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, because there was a time, especially in the, I guess, 60s, early 70s and stuff,  they were just knocking down old ballparks and building these behemoth, ugly, no personality  ballparks.  It was like Shea.  And then we had a White Sox played for a while.  It was like a giant fucking toilet.  It was a bowl with seats in it.  That's all they wanted.  They said, give us as many seats as you can.  Yeah, it's terrible.  With no personality to it.  No real feel. 
[00:27:30]  And, well, now, you know, they're doing other things.  Yeah.  The Astrodome.  Hopefully they'll have the seatings the way, the seatings, boo.  So hopefully the seating will be the way it used to be.  The Astrodome kind of ended that whole thing.  Huh?  The Astrodome kind of ended that whole thing because it was just so massive.  It was like 90,000 seats or whatever.  Yeah, gigantic.  Which is ridiculous.  Unless your team has to be great every year for that stadium to make sense.  Let the kids play.  Yeah, yeah, sure. 
[00:28:00]  What happened?  They went to play in the Astrodome?  They ran out of time.  So they were just going to call the game and stuff like that.  And then, well, you know, Bears had to play and win.  Yeah, so, you know, the fans had to start to chant because they really wanted to see, like,  Let them play.  Oh, the players came out, some old fucking players.  That'll date a movie pretty quickly when you have actual players from a team in a movie.  It's like Willie Stargell.  It's like, what the hell is that? 
[00:28:30]  Hey, Walter Matthau wasn't in part two, was he?  No, that was William Devane.  Bill Devane played the coach in that one.  Isn't it the same guy from the Marathon Man?  Yes.  Who fucking...  Bill Devane was a bad guy.  He played the brother, I think, or something like that.  No, Roy Scheider was the brother.  Roy Scheider was the brother.  Bill Devane was the guy who told Dustin Hoffman, come on, I'll get you out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  And then just drove him in a circle and dropped him back off.  Dropped him back off.  That was horrible. 
[00:29:00]  Janie or something his name was.  Yeah.  He was the coach.  That beef is something, isn't it?  That's crazy.  It won't stop.  What?  Well, we're trying to get people up here as soon as possible, so, I mean, there's like  three or four security guards out there.  Yeah, they're working this crowd.  Working the crowd, so.  All right.  I like how they let us get in, though, before they let the crowd in, which is nice so we  don't have to walk through them.  Well, of course.  It'd be great if we only let the crowd in from, say, 6.15 to 7, and then we boot them 
[00:29:30]  all back out again.  Beat it.  The minute they get in.  Right at the last beep of the last person.  Beep out.  All right, get out.  Like Dwight Yoakam.  Let's go to Jerry in Canada.  Jerry.  Jerry.  You're stupid.  Well, I try to have a conversation before he jumps into whatever the fuck he's going  to talk about.  I'm sure this is going to be interesting for everybody, but he'll keep going, because that's  what they do in Canada. 
[00:30:00]  We didn't hear you, Jerry.  What'd you say, buddy?  Did you hear about the Def Leppard tribute DVD?  God, he's going to say it again.  No, I didn't hear it.  He's so unaware of everything.  He really doesn't know.  He has no effing clue.  He has no one gives a shit about what he has to say.  It's a joke about it.  One arm.  Except Rick Allen.  He's talking about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Tribute band, I think.  Well, how come, why didn't he like it?  Was there a thing with it, or was there some kind of an improper licensing issue? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  He has no clue.  We're just trying to keep him on the phone so we can make more fun of him.  It's, um...  Oh, I'm not sure why somebody wouldn't like a tribute.  Hold on, hold on.  I think I got...  I'm sorry.  You know what happened?  I really didn't...  I really didn't get the joke at first.  But now that you've explained...  I can hardly hear what he's saying, man.  What...  How did that go?  Because I want to...  Okay, the whole band...  He's still not onto this.  Right?  You guys hear me, or what?  Now I kind of...  Yeah, yeah, go ahead. 
[00:31:00]  Okay, they had a look at the DVD.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Right?  And they all liked it, except for Rick Allen.  He only gave him one.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, I'm saying, did Rick Allen blog about that, or did he make it public that he didn't  like it?  I mean...  I think it had something to do with his arm.  I'm not sure.  Did he...  There you go, Anthony.  You got it.  What do you mean?  Was that it?  He wasn't...  Anthony got the joke.  Boo!  What joke?  Tell Jim one more time.  He's fucking thick.  I usually would get it.  Jimmy's a fucking retard.  Tell him one more time.  Ow! 
[00:31:30]  Gotcha.  Immediately.  Isn't that funny?  Oh, same awful one.  Dummy.  Okay.  See, the CD came out, and it got two thumbs up, and shut up.  Except for Rick Allen.  I mean, he shortened it at the end.  He finally just went direct to Rick Allen.  Yeah.  But at first, he was like, and then the band had to watch it, and they didn't like it,  so then they went home, and they all voted.  We gotcha.  We gotcha.  I just want to give a shout-out to Travis's team.  The Canadians beat the Islanders last night.  Yeah.  Kicked their ass.  I saw Travis's little tweet.  I call it a Twitter. 
[00:32:00]  I don't even want to say a tweet.  He got pretty good seats, it looks like.  Yeah.  He was right there by the glass, unless he ran down and took a shot and ran back up to  his shitty seat.  Well, the beauty is, if you're a Canadians fan, in this case, and you go to the Islanders,  you know, the Coliseum, there's a lot of seats available where the Canadians are going  to shoot twice.  Because if you're an Islander fan, you want to kind of be on the other side as much as  possible.  Got you.  So it's very easy to get those type of tickets.  Ah. 
[00:32:30]  Still got to pay, you know, a bloody fortune for them.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Justin in Huntington.  Justin.  Yes.  Go ahead, man.  Yes.  What's up, Justin?  You're on the air.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that.  I have a fucking caller.  What has nine arms and sucks?  Death Leopard.  Don't plow through.  And who gives a shit about that?  My God.  Wait.  What?  What was that?  He knows.  Yeah.  He's totally onto it.  The best thing is to get the people that are totally onto it, though. 
[00:33:00]  That's the best feeling of satisfaction.  And they start it, and you go, I heard you.  Hey, Travis, Canadians are in eighth place?  Seventh now.  Oh.  Seventh place now.  Watch out.  All right.  Well.  Well.  Were you cheering like a little girl?  No, no.  Not like a man.  Oh.  Oh.  Did you guys have your jerseys on?  Sure did.  He had his jerseys on.  Different kind of jersey. 
[00:33:30]  Doesn't matter.  But you're right.  And he was in the turnpike.  Yeah.  Like, the entire lower bowl is just filled with Canadians fans because they're willing to pay that much.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Because up there, every game is sold out, and you've got to pay a fortune just to get in.  So if you can pay, you know, a hundred bucks.  A lot of Canadians fans?  Yeah.  I'd say it was about 60-40.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, you just mentioned Twitter.  Yes.  This thing came out of nowhere, as we all know.  I mean, it's been around about a year. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  But the last two or three months, it really just exploded onto the scene.  Google's in late-stage talks to buy Twitter for 250 million fucking dollars.  God damn it.  That's pretty cheap.  A nice little idea, and look, these guys might walk away with like a quarter billion dollars.  How do you just do that?  I mean, you come up with some dumb fucking idea like that.  It's not even a new idea.  It's just texting stuff to the masses.  That's all it is, really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it was invented already, but these guys are going to come away with like a quarter 
[00:34:30]  billion if it goes through, if Google buys them.  Oh.  Everyone's getting annoyed at my cock ring.  Oh, my God.  They're all so annoyed.  Jimmy and his cock ring theme going on with Twitter.  I was wondering how long that would take to really start bugging people.  I like the one with your cock ring on your phone.  Yeah.  And you had it by your ear.  Hello.  I can't find my cock ring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at his face, too. 
[00:35:00]  I like I'm talking.  Ah.  You can't find my cock ring.  Ah.  Is that an actual cock ring?  Of course it is.  Of course.  I don't know.  Yes.  That looks like it would fucking do some damage.  No, it's rubber.  It looks very tight.  Are those?  Yes.  Open it.  It looks like tough plastic that doesn't move on the sides.  It looks like a dog toy.  Well, Dan, it's funny you say that.  Yes, that is.  I like the one where it's on your toe when you're sleeping.  Oh, yeah.  What happened with the White House? 
[00:35:30]  Getting some of these stories out of the way.  Well, the property value is.  Yeah, I got a few things.  What happened?  Problem.  Problem.  Well, the White House corrects conference call number after directing reporters to sex line.  Oops.  Yeah.  That's like when they used to send people to WhiteHouse.com.  And it was a massive.  And it was WhiteHouse.gov.  Yeah.  And WhiteHouse.com was a heavy, hardcore porno site.  It was a fine porno site.  That guy wound up, because he had kids and his kids were getting older, he wound up selling 
[00:36:00]  it for a shitload of money, but he didn't want to be a porno guy anymore.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He made his fortune in it, and then he was like, I don't want my kids knowing about this,  so he offed it.  What about everybody else's kids?  Yeah, no kidding.  His forehand.  Wait, who is this?  The guy that owned WhiteHouse.com, which was the porn site.  He sold it, because he was getting kids that were starting to grow up and learn about these  things, and he didn't want them to be like, oh yeah, my father's the porno fucking maven. 
[00:36:30]  How much did he get for it?  Three, four bucks.  Murr!  No, he got a, I don't know the amount, but a fuckload.  He probably got WhiteHouse.com for his kids.  He probably just wanted the money.  He said it for his kids.  He could have taken care of, like, generations of the family.  How many people went there thinking it was the White House, though?  Like, millions upon millions of people.  Well, they may have made his life a little difficult with certain tax investigations.  Oh, I don't doubt that. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, there's ways to.  Yeah.  And then some guys in Jersey are in trouble.  I'm seeing this story on here.  I heard it on the news this morning.  There were those strange lights in the sky over Jersey.  People were talking UFOs.  Wait a minute.  Wait, I got to give it to Greg Brady.  UFOs over Jersey. 
[00:37:30]  Wait, over Jersey?  Over Jersey.  Yeah, there were UFOs.  Bobo!  We're going to run this into the ground today.  I'm not going to it.  This is the day where everyone officially gets sick of it.  Bobo!  I was asleep, and there was a UFO in over my house in Jersey.  I hope I don't get probed.  Oh, no.  I think I did get probed.  I'm farting fire out of my ass. 
[00:38:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right.  A little South Park reference there.  Yeah, yeah.  A little rip-off, whatever you want to call it.  Not bad for off-the-cuff, though.  Come on.  Yeah, you got to give it to him.  So, the lights over Jersey.  Yeah, it turned out to be a couple of guys taking highway flares on fishing line and helium balloons.  And they would send these things up, and people would freak out because they'd see these lights in the sky.  And they wound up getting arrested.  Well, that's funny.  Endangering some type of reckless endangerment. 
[00:38:30]  Said it could have interfered with air traffic.  How high did things go?  Two, three feet.  Well, who the fuck saw them?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they'd keep going up, I guess, until the helium ran out.  Oh, they let them go.  Yeah, you know, they just let these things go.  It's the hoax law, right?  I don't know.  I know they have it in radio.  You're not allowed to do, like, hoaxes anymore.  But they're hoaxes that would take away from public safety. 
[00:39:00]  So if you do a hoax that gets the police in a certain area, fire department, if you get on the air and say, like, there's an emergency happening somewhere or a fire, then you get in trouble.  How about if you say there's bushels of apples in everybody's mailbox?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  And I don't think anyone gets in trouble.  It's wholesome.  Sure.  It's big laughs.  Where? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, turn the mic on there.  Yeah.  Perhaps the microphone's off.  We're making them sit Indian style out there.  So that could be the problem.  Maybe they're laughing.  The empty bleachers in here.  Yeah.  Cool.  There it is.  Wow.  That's a good one.  The old flares.  Where is it?  Not one person could figure it out, though.  It was in Morristown.  Yeah.  A lot of people figured it out.  A lot of people were saying, yeah, it's probably flares on balloons. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  But people that saw them were freaking out.  Authorities and experts were like, oh, yeah, this is an old gag.  But anyone with a brain wasn't freaking out.  So why are these kids in trouble?  And they'd flash.  They'd flicker and flash because as the balloon would swing these things, you could kind of  see them and then not see them a little bit.  So it really looked like it.  And they'd launch like four or five at a time.  Right.  So you'd think you'd see one big object.  Right.  But actually, it's just a bunch of these balloons clustered together. 
[00:40:30]  So they looked pretty good.  And now they're in trouble because I guess they had to say, hey, look at what I did.  Like, no one could keep their yap shut and just go, yeah, that was funny.  But if you're going to do something like that, you got to tell somebody.  Well, they put it all over the web and stuff.  Yeah, well, you got it.  They want recognition.  They want their little claim to fame.  But maybe they, yeah.  All right.  That's where they messed up.  Yeah.  They'll be all right in the end.  We tried doing that.  But we didn't have flares.  So we set fire to anvils. 
[00:41:00]  Ah.  They just wouldn't take off.  They wouldn't?  No.  So we had to get people like, look at the UFOs there on the ground.  They've landed.  Yeah.  We're in trouble now.  Help.  Help.  It stinks.  Handful.  Jesus.  Oh, they're right against the glass like we're Shamu.  Yeah, this is going to get pretty crowded.  They're not going to want to stand for the entire show.  Even those uncomfortable bleachers, at least they're sitting. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  You know?  Well, the deal is I think we're going to move these people inside in a little while.  Yeah.  And then we're going to fill up the outside like we usually do.  I think it's going to be close to 100 people here today in the studio.  Yeah.  Shawn Michaels live on the news.  The Heartbreak Kid.  Oh, what is Shawn doing?  I don't know.  I'm sure Sam knows.  But setting up for the big WrestleMania.  Yeah.  That's Saturday.  Tomorrow, I think.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, can't wait to miss that. 
[00:42:00]  Sam, it's WrestleMania time, right?  Yeah.  Is Shawn Michaels wrestling?  Yeah, Shawn Michaels is wrestling.  Oh, don't be silly.  Shawn Michaels is fighting The Undertaker.  He's going to try to break the streak.  What streak?  The Undertaker's 17-0 at WrestleMania.  Are you kidding?  Or 18-0 or something.  Yeah.  They're not going to give it to Shawn Michaels.  I don't know.  Shawn Michaels missed at WrestleMania.  He put Ric Flair out.  He's been in 18 WrestleMania as The Undertaker?  Yeah, he started at WrestleMania.  How old is The Undertaker?  He's an old guy now.  Well, he's technically undead, so. 
[00:42:30]  Technically.  He started at WrestleMania 7.  He started in WrestleMania 7.  Matter of fact.  Is that one a year?  Yeah, one a year.  Okay.  He fought the Superfly.  He hasn't been in every single WrestleMania, because he wasn't at WrestleMania.  Where's Ass Man?  Billy Gunn?  Well, I'm an Ass Man.  Remember the Ass Man song?  You're old school now.  What happened to Ass Man?  He's got to be dead.  No, he started wrestling.  He's in TNA.  He's wrestling as Kip James.  Here it is.  Crank this.  Why?  Because his ass is saggy now? 
[00:43:00]  He can't be the Ass Man anymore?  I think Vince McMahon owns Mr. Ass.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I'm an Ass Man.  What a gay song.  And he'd come out with the little hot pants with the lipstick on him that says Mr. Ass.  What a clown.  It was a funny gimmick.  You got to give it to the guy.  That was funny.  They must laugh.  Like, yeah, you're Ass Man, dude.  That's funny as shit.  Badass Billy Gunn.  Mr. Ass.  Billy Gunn.  And who was his partner for a while?  The Road Dog, Jesse James. 
[00:43:30]  The Road Dog.  What happened to him?  He's also in TNA.  Oh, is he?  Well, he hasn't wrestled in a while.  He went through some shit for a while.  Yeah.  He went through some drug problems.  But he's not the Road Dog anymore, is he?  No, now he's BG James.  Yeah, because see, Vince owns all the names.  Of course.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you?  But he still wrestles in, like, the same, kind of the same clothes.  Like, he still has a baggy pants and t-shirt look.  Yeah.  Vince holds all these names in his pockets like so many nickels and dimes.  He must let us wet our beaks.  How much money does one guy need?  I know.  It's just these guys have their names. 
[00:44:00]  He has their dumb names.  That's where he makes his money.  But then he can start coming out with DVDs.  And even after they're gone, he can still release merchandise.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's what he does.  They sign their life away.  Yeah.  They should.  There's Young Undertaker.  Wow.  I know it's a visual, but...  Is that, like, right when he started or something?  That's before the gimmick.  Yeah, that was before Undertaker.  I think it was me and Mark Calloway.  No way!  He was in the WWF.  He was WCW.  Oh, he was WCW.  Because for years, no one knew who the hell he was. 
[00:44:30]  They kept that secret pretty well hidden.  Then in 1990, at Survivor Series, he came out as the Undertaker in WWF.  Yeah.  So how old is he?  He's undead.  He's not...  He doesn't have an age.  I mean...  Let's give an answer.  What are you kidding?  Let's break character for a second, please.  Character?  Well, I mean...  How old would he be if he was in human years?  He was alive.  He's undead, but like you say, he was in human years.  Oh, I got you.  I got you.  Well, we started in WWF in 1990.  That was, you know, 19 years ago. 
[00:45:00]  He was probably...  He might have been under 30 then, so he might be under 50.  So he's not even 50 yet?  He might not be.  Come on.  He's in his 40s, I think.  He's in good shape.  Is he?  He's in fantastic shape.  Know what about his brother?  Kane?  Kane.  Kane is in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  He's unmasked and bald now.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  For a while now.  Oh.  They unmasked him.  Why do they do that?  Because he...  He had a good gimmick, though.  Oh, that's who I was thinking of. 
[00:45:30]  Kane, right.  He was the one that was masked.  Yeah.  They kept it a secret.  But he lost to Triple H.  He put the mask on the line.  Jesus.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  How do you remember this stuff?  I was there.  He's masked in Square Garden.  Do you remember this stuff?  Yeah.  Undertaker's actually pretty young.  If this information is correct, he's only about 44.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, he could be.  I mean, he's ain't really...  What a career he's had, huh?  Yeah.  He's a locker room general.  You're an asshole.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  Thank you, Sam.  That's our wrestling talk.  WrestleMania tomorrow.  You going?  Or is it a Sunday?  Sunday.  No, I'm not going.  Why?  No, why?  I'll be going to Big Kev's house to check it out, though.  There's a little club.  Ah, there you go.  Could you pick up my camera while you're there?  Yeah.  I have a Canon camera over there, so tell him you'll be taking that with you.  Will do.  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's in Houston.  They didn't send Eric and me down this year.  Yeah, times are tough.  I heard they were going to, though.  What happened?  Yeah, they were going to, but, you know, times are tough, and they couldn't get their stuff 
[00:46:30]  together.  With all this free advertising we give them, they should give you a trip.  Oh, my God.  You should be in the WWE.  You can be?  We had a lot of wrestling talk lately.  Yeah.  We had John Cena in, pumping it up.  Yeah.  We played that Ric Flair, Roddy Piper audio.  Oh, that was just unbelievable.  It was good stuff.  We called you an asshole.  That was...  And then you backed down.  It was great radio.  It was great.  Back down, you pussy.  Well, it's Roddy Piper.  What could he possibly do to you?  Well, I mean, he didn't even have a finishing move.  People said, what's your finishing move?  He said, anything comes to mind.  Oh, okay. 
[00:47:00]  He put a lot of people in the sleeper, though.  Did he have bubblegum with him?  No, that's a problem.  Oh, shit.  Okay, then there's a problem.  Are they running out of finishing moves?  No way.  Because now, if you go into wrestling, you have to have the finishing move.  Of course.  Like old school wrestlers, they had a few little...  A few different things they would do.  And it would be like a variation of the pile driver.  What was the tombstone, really?  Well, no, that was the tombstone pile driver.  Yeah.  But it's different than the pile...  Like, Jerry Lawler just did a pile driver.  Yeah.  But the tombstone would put you out. 
[00:47:30]  But then there was some other ones that were pretty much the pile driver, but different.  A little different.  A leg drop and different.  Like, what was the rock's stupid move?  What, the people's elbow?  The people's elbow.  The people's elbow.  It was the people's elbow.  Yeah.  Oh, and they loved when he did that.  Yeah.  He did that little move with his arm.  Yeah.  And then he'd bounce off the ropes twice for no apparent reason.  Threw the elbow pad out into the crowd.  Kick his leg a little bit.  Yeah.  And then the elbow...  I love when these fucking guys go from rope to rope, but they need momentum to fucking 
[00:48:00]  fall on a guy.  You lose the momentum like three feet away from the rope anyway.  They jump over him, and then they go to the other rope, and they bounce off, and then  they jump off, and it's so fucking stupid.  That's what he did.  And then he'd shake his leg and...  It does make the impact more severe.  Oh, it does.  Yes.  What was Hogan's move with his big, dumb leg?  Oh, it started...  Oh, it was this stupid leg drop.  Yeah.  Or the big boot is the setup.  Yeah.  And the guy goes down, and then your leg drop.  Yeah, when do we do this?  You just get up and listen for the crowd's cheers from the forecast. 
[00:48:30]  Let's name a wrestler and see if you got the finishing move.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, let's start with...  What's his name?  Oh, Shawn Michaels.  Shawn Michaels.  Super kick.  Sweet chin music.  He says it like we should all know.  You see him tuning up the band?  He's tuning up the band when he's stomping in the ring.  That's how you know it's coming, baby.  What about Mankind?  Yeah.  Boy, that was the mandible claw.  Oh, I remember the mandible.  Oh, my God, he's got him in the mandible claw! 
[00:49:00]  See, there's nerves.  If you press under your tongue, there are nerves that will temporarily paralyze you  when you press down on them.  Wait, he would put his hand in someone else's mouth?  Yes, he wore like the sock.  The sock puppet.  But before that, he had a glove that covered his middle two fingers only,  and then he'd stick those in a person's mouth.  Isn't that the shocker he'd give him, pretty much?  Yeah.  All right, we need another.  He's giving him two in the pink one in the snake.  Oh, my God!  We need another wrestler. 
[00:49:30]  We got to try to stump you, though.  Yeah, yeah.  What was, let's go old school.  Mr. Perfect, the dead guy, what was his?  The Perfect Plex.  It was a variation of the Fisherman's Suplex,  where he'd hook your neck and your leg,  bring you back, and you're pinned, baby.  Ah.  Well, you mentioned the Ass Man.  What about the Ass Man?  Did he have a finishing move?  Of course he did.  The Fame-asser.  That's where, you know, you'd be bent over, and he'd put one leg over your head,  and then, like, sit down. 
[00:50:00]  The Fame-asser.  Right.  It's going to make you famous.  The Fame-asser.  The Fame-asser.  Yeah.  That is fantastic.  It was all an Ass Man!  It's got good music.  Yeah, great music.  Nice tights.  You got to bring the Ass Man back.  Who else?  Who else?  Ah.  Ah.  You know, who else do they got?  Uh.  What was so many motor residents?  I'm trying to think, like, ten years ago.  Yeah.  I want to go back a little ways.  Honky Tonk Man did the shake, rattle, and roll.  Honky Tonk Man.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Shake, rattle, and roll.  How about Chief J Strongbow?  I don't know.  That was back before they even.  That's way, way before.  The finishing move officially started, what, about 15 years ago?  When you had, like, trademarks with names.  What was Owen's?  Owen used a sharpshooter.  Like Brett, except he always said his was better.  Did he?  Yes.  So he ripped off his brother's finishing move?  Well, he started doing it when he was feuding with his brother,  and he used to wear Bret Hart sunglasses to the ring and rip them up.  Let's stick with the dead guys. 
[00:51:00]  A British bulldog?  That was the running power slam, where he'd get you up on his shoulder  and run from the corner and just,  you're not going to kick out of a running power slam from the bulldog.  What about, of course, Chris Benoit?  Chris Benoit.  The crippler crossface.  The crippler crossface?  The move, which we will not speak of,  because there were allegations that he used it on his family members.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if that was true.  Wow.  All the reporters said that he used a move similar to his finisher move. 
[00:51:30]  Well, what was that move?  I don't watch that.  It's a chokehold.  You lock the arm with your legs, and then you choke,  like the guy's laying on the ground,  and you lay on top of his shoulders,  lock his left arm with your leg,  and then just choke the neck, you know what I mean?  With his arm?  With your arm, yeah.  What about Jake?  DDT.  DDT?  Even I remember that.  He'd spin his finger in the air,  and you'd know it was coming.  DDT time.  And everyone would be going,  DDT! 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, they knew.  And the guy was so dazed,  he couldn't even see it coming,  even with all the people chanting.  Wow, this crowd's getting big.  They were applauding.  What happened out there?  What happened out there?  They were applauding for, I think.  For the DDT.  They were applauding for it.  Oh, well.  Is that why you guys are clapping?  Yeah, DDT.  DDT.  No, I don't think they were.  I told you, listen to him.  Listen to him chant.  They'll chant anything.  At this point.  They don't care.  What about the Bushwhackers?  Oh, that was the battering ram.  Oh, that's right.  The one guy, you know, 
[00:52:30]  put his partner in almost a headlock  and just run into people.  And run his head into people.  Yeah.  That was a silly move.  They didn't get to perform it very often  because they lost a lot of matches.  Josh and Tuskens ask Coco Beware's finishing move.  I believe that was like a big splash.  He'd fly, wouldn't he?  Did he have a name for it, though?  I don't know.  He was another one who never really got a finishing move  because he rarely won.  Superfly.  What was it called?  The Superfly Splash.  Yeah, the Superfly Splash. 
[00:53:00]  Superfly's going to fly.  They'd just say, Superfly's going to fly.  Yeah, he's up on the top rope.  Yeah.  Scott Steiner.  Oh, Scott Steiner went through a whole bunch of them,  but his most famous one was the Frankensteiner.  The names of these moves are fantastic.  We did the...  Big Boss Man.  Yeah.  Did we get that one?  That was like a sidewalk slam  that at one point he called it like  greetings from Cobb County, Georgia  or something like that.  Cobb County, Georgia.  Yeah, definitely a sidewalk slam.  He had a pretty badass song, too.  Yeah.  It was, you know, 
[00:53:30]  mentioned Cobb County, Georgia in it.  And then he said, you better read the signs,  respect the law and order.  Right, yes.  You'll serve hard time.  Stupid Sam knows it all.  I know every word to that song.  Walking encyclopedia on this stuff.  That's why he wins all the fucking trivia contests.  Yep.  Destroy.  He's amazing.  No one's better than you, Sam.  How about Macho Man?  Come on.  The Flying Elbow.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He'd do the double axe.  In the middle of the match,  you'd think it was coming, 
[00:54:00]  but it would just be the double axe hand.  Yeah.  Then he'd finish it off  with the Flying Elbow off the top.  Did we go through Roddy already?  He used to say anything that comes to mind,  but he loved that sleeper hold.  Yeah.  Did that sleeper hold.  Oh, yeah.  The only one I remember is the figure four leg lock  from Greg Valentine.  Oh.  And Ric Flair.  Woo!  I don't know.  That's fucking horrendous.  That gives me douche chills every time I hear it.  Woo!  Woo!  I don't remember him doing that.  Oh, you do that all the time.  He is the best promo guy ever. 
[00:54:30]  Woo!  They seem to be wooing outside.  Woo!  Oh.  Oh, don't do that.  He used to yell at the promo guy,  my shoes cost more than your house.  What an idiot.  He's a million dollar man.  Oh, the million dollar dream.  Did we do Ric Flair's finishing move, though?  Yeah, figure four.  Figure four.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that one looked like it hurt.  Yeah, Flair also done used it, too.  Aside from finishing moves, though, I like Flair.  I know what you're going to say.  Yeah, he always had, like, signature moves that he had to do in ring.  And one of my favorite ones was how he would get thrown into the turnbuckle, 
[00:55:00]  but then flip upside down and then walk across the ring apron to get clothes lined down.  Every single match, this would happen.  Yeah, Bret Hart said in his book that he used to hate wrestling Ric Flair  because Ric Flair only ever wrestled one match.  He just did it over and over and over.  And then you watch these old Flair matches from the 80s,  and it's like, how did anybody think this was real?  It's the same thing.  The best thing Flair used to do is he used to get hit and hit and hit,  and he wouldn't go down, and then he'd walk away and fall out of his face. 
[00:55:30]  How about Dr. D, David Schultz?  His finishing move was slapping, what's his name, for 2020 in his ear.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, remember that?  Very good.  Brock Lesnar, who's now a UFC fighter.  The F5.  The F5.  It's like the FU.  Finger God.  Yeah, you'd get him up on your shoulders and just...  And Goldberg, who used to play football.  The jackhammer.  The jackhammer.  Oh.  Well, yeah, the spear was the setup, and then the big jackhammer, and it was done.  All right.  Yeah.  And how about, who did we have in here recently? 
[00:56:00]  Xena?  No, no, no.  Kurt Angle?  Yeah, Angle.  That was, well, first it was the Olympic Slam, and then it became the Angle Slam.  Yeah, yeah.  The Olympics probably said stop.  Then he started doing the ankle lock when he got into submissions.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, Sam.  Good job.  Sam, once again, showing off his wrestling prowess.  Your knowledge is amazing.  Thank you very much.  Almost retarded.  Okay.  An idiot savant, of course.  Yeah.  Without the savant part. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, that pesky, pesky savant part.  I'm amazed by it.  Some people would sit here and go, shut the...  Who gives a fuck?  Right.  I think it's very interesting.  I just wanted to keep going, because he just rattles them off.  And the way he says it is like, you should know.  Yeah.  Well, you should.  It's like, well, of course.  Just stop it.  It's...  Is a human being going to ask, what's Randy Savage's finishing move?  You should know.  I mean, flying elbow.  I've watched a lot of wrestling in my day.  I think I knew five of those.  Maybe.  Come on. 
[00:57:00]  Maybe.  I knew Grey Valentine.  I knew, I guess...  I knew the people's elbow.  Of course.  Well, Triple H's was the...  The pedigree.  The pedigree.  Right.  Which was nothing more than a...  No.  I mean, this is a unique move, where you get the guy's head between your legs.  Yeah.  You think he's setting him up for a pile driver.  Yeah.  But then you lock the arms and go down to the knees, so his head just slams against the  mat.  That one's very impressive looking, because it really did look...  They were able to pull that one off pretty well. 
[00:57:30]  Well, you don't have much of a choice when a guy like Triple H is locking you.  Yes, you do.  One.  You tell him beforehand, look, don't break my fucking neck.  Triple H says, you know what?  No promises, because we're out there fighting.  It doesn't really say that.  It's the type of thing he would say.  All right.  Listen.  Sam, do your parents ever wish that you put this much effort into law school or something?  That's all I got growing up.  That they said, obviously, you can retain knowledge and pay attention to things.  I don't understand why you don't get better grades.  Yeah.  They take away my wrestling all the time. 
[00:58:00]  That was my punishment when I was a kid.  Wow.  Because I never went anywhere.  So I never got grounded.  I never did anything.  It's like, no wrestling.  Yeah.  And did you go...  I was very upset.  I missed many good wrestling shows because of below average grades.  What got you started on this?  I started watching...  Why, though?  I mean, do you just like looking at big, huge, muscular men?  Well, no.  When you phrase it like that, it sounds weird.  Well...  Does it?  Yeah.  Yeah, but see, at least Ant and I could say, because we're older, when we got into wrestling, 
[00:58:30]  they were out of shape fat guys that looked like idiots.  And it was funny.  Right.  I used to watch Bastion Booger.  He was an out of shape fat guy.  We had Haystack's Calhoun and Gorilla Monsoon and Bruno Sammartino with his big, huge man  boob.  Hacksaw Jim Duggan, finishing move.  Oh, that was the...  They called it the three-point stance, where you get down like that, and then it was just  a running clothesline.  That's right.  It was a football move.  Yeah.  Well, that's how you set it up. 
[00:59:00]  It's kind of...  Why not just run?  Because when you come down like this, and then...  Everyone knew when he did that, it was like...  And the momentum of it.  Of course.  I used to love when they would throw each other against the ropes, and then they would pass  each other in the middle of the ring and hit the other...  Yeah, why would they pass...  Sometimes they'd go back and forth...  With the opposite ropes.  Yeah.  Because, again, momentum...  Why wouldn't he hit him right when he passed him?  The first time.  Traveling at a fairly high velocity.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  You're welcome.  I want to get an update from Kenny.  How's the crowd, Kenny? 
[00:59:30]  We got a big one today, huh?  If you don't mind, I'd like to move people in on the bleachers in the studio because...  Are there people still outside?  The audience is on hold because we're at capacity.  We got a line out the door?  Yes.  Let's do that.  And out in the rain.  And out in the rain?  Yes.  How many people we got in here so far?  A lot.  Yeah, you don't want to give numbers on them.  Sounds to me like a case of tough titty.  Oh, Jim.  If you're outside.  Oh, my God.  I have to open this window and piss on them.  We're kind of shy, but we're going to bring the people into the studio and then we're 
[01:00:00]  going to fill up that area again?  Well, we're going to pick and choose the fancy people to bring into the studio.  Yeah, not like that asshole in the bear suit yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't need that.  Yeah, let him go back to the ghetto.  Jesus.  He was obnoxious.  He really had a problem with you.  Yeah, yeah.  He said I was bitter.  But meanwhile, I'm employed and I cash my pension check every month and I have my health 
[01:00:30]  benefits for the rest of my life.  Right.  And it was all for just kicking his family's ass your whole career.  Well, thanks for saying that, Anthony.  Big A should be on the street, by the way.  Let's put him back on the street.  What?  That'll save room for fucking five, six people.  Yeah, Big A beat it.  We've got to start using lifeboat rules here.  No Ron and Fez regulars here today, so Big A hit the street.  Oh, whoa! 
[01:01:00]  Well, if I can say this, Big A is coming to see Little Jimmy in Poughkeepsie tonight.  Oh!  Well, tell him to start driving now because there's no room for him in here.  How's he getting up there?  I don't know.  Maybe his gypsy cab.  Jesus, does he drive that thing for pleasure?  Yeah.  He had two shows tonight, Banana-ers in Poughkeepsie.  Nice, Ken.  Good plug.  Look at that.  Sam.  And speaking of Big A, one of the prizes we'll be giving out today is the famous date picture  of Big A and Stonker Patty on the big chair. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, wow.  When they went on their big date, that went so well.  How many more did they have after that?  Oh, that's right.  None.  None more.  None more dates.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Kenny, thank you.  I guess we'll move some people.  Take a break.  We'll start bringing some of these riffraff in.  Yeah.  And, yeah, we'll continue with the show.  Wow.  Look who's here.  Drew Boogie.  Ah, Drew Boogie.  Take us out, Drew.  I had to go to my...  They were going to find us!  No! 
[01:02:00]  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Don't do that! </pre>
