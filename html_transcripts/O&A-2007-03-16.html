<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic scene, likely triggered by a fart, followed by a segment focusing on waking up amputees, featuring graphic listener calls detailing various amputation accidents. Rich Voss filled in for Jim Norton, contributing humorous childbirth anecdotes.  The show then promoted their Las Vegas comedy tour.  A later segment included more gruesome injury stories and a discussion about morbidly obese individuals on YouTube, concluding with angry listener messages.

The show continued with Opie's recounting of his online video-watching adventures and their consequences, leading into discussion of a MacBook Karaoke contest and a Greenwich Village shooting, with speculation about the shooter's race. They detailed the shooting and the shooter's death, contrasting media coverage of the incident with public reaction to nudity. The suicide of Brad Delp was discussed, including details from his suicide note, followed by personal anecdotes about Delp and reflections on fame. Opie shared humorous stories about his past poverty, including stealing cookies.

Listener calls followed, alongside shocking news stories: a girl receiving her dog's severed head and a grandmother facing sex abuse charges for webcam sex acts with her grandchildren.  The hosts provided darkly humorous and sexually explicit commentary on these stories, featuring many listener calls with graphic and sexually charged content.  An update on the arrest of a suspect in the assault of a 101-year-old woman was given, leading into a discussion about *300* and male nudity, followed by E-Rock showcasing websites of nude elderly women, sparking further sexually charged banter. The show concluded with promotional announcements and another listener call.

A subsequent segment began with a caller's disturbing dream inspired by the "Picture Your Grandma Naked" game, triggering discussion of the game and the controversy surrounding the St. Patrick's Day Parade's placement of the FDNY.  Numerous sexually explicit calls followed, including descriptions for the game and detailed pornography descriptions.  The hosts dissected a seemingly innocuous segment from the "Janet and Nick" radio show, repeatedly replaying and editing it for comedic effect.  A fireman and a police officer called in regarding the parade. The show concluded with an outdoor segment ("the walkover") in frigid weather, resulting in many expletives, and mention of a contest involving brownies and Mr. Potato Head.

The following segment addressed listener complaints about repeated comedic bits, with Opie and Anthony defending their scheduling.  The show featured off-color jokes and a comedian's anecdotes about audience members throwing objects at him.  Guests included H-Cup Jane, whose large breasts were a focal point of discussion and lewd jokes; Stalker Patty, who was criticized for not bringing a pre-recorded segment; and Rich Voss, who performed a "prison comedy" routine.  A firefighter who listened during a house fire and a caller named Butters, who shared rambling and unconventional stories, also called in. Finally, Todd performed acapella versions of heavy metal songs.

The final segment featured in-studio guest Stalker Patty, beginning with a reaction to a caller's on-air stunt.  The discussion involved sexually explicit plans for a "booby lantern," suggestions of joking about "raping" Patty, and a prolonged, graphic discussion about using a vibrator with Patty, culminating in her on-air masturbation.  The "Money Snatch" game involved Patty, naked with a paper bag over her head, collecting money and inserting it into her vagina using a condom and a "fake jizz" concoction. The show concluded with sexually explicit jokes, promotion of BodogFight.com and UnlearnNow.com, and references to several unidentified individuals.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  As daylight breaks, creeping through the shadows, an unstoppable force lays in wait, ready to strike.  Oh my God!  Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I get scared.  I think I'm scared.  Oh God!  Holy mother of God! 
[00:00:30]  Oh boy, please don't!  God damn it!  What?  What?  Oh, it stinks so bad!  Oh my God!  This is killing me!  You're killing me!  Uh-oh, just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my God!  I got to show you the fire today!  You just got to stand here!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Ah!  I'm scum because I'm a shapely European blonde. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at his face.  How do you not love it and want to keep this?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday!  Friday!  Hello.  Good morning. 
[00:02:00]  You're about to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  About to?  They are.  You have begun listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm good.  Yesterday we woke up lactating mothers, right?  Yeah.  And that led to an hour discussion about being in the delivery room.  Right.  Right.  Terrific stories yesterday coming in.  Potential fathers waiting for their wives to deliver and being in the delivery room 
[00:02:30]  and their insistence on being there.  How is that?  Because I know a Bonnie is expecting and we have Rich Voss in for Jim Norton today.  And Rich, you ever been in the delivery room for any of your numerous children?  Yeah.  I told my, I'm not lying.  I said, can they speed this up?  Because I wanted to go out and have a cigarette with my two daughters.  But didn't you just smoke in the delivery room?  Well, when they were-  Yeah, back in the day, you could smoke in the delivery room.  When they were in the hospital, both of them had asthma and they were both in together. 
[00:03:00]  And I would sneak in the bathroom and have a cigarette and I got in a lot of trouble.  But, because they had asthma and it was a hospital.  Yeah, I was in the delivery room.  It's not, that stuff doesn't thrill me.  It's just, I'm kind of like with Bonnie, like I'm hoping, I'm kind of hoping it's like a beautiful girl.  Then I'm kind of hoping, well, if it's black, then I can get out of this relationship and move on.  I don't have to be a father at 500.  You know, so I'm going, well, do I have to deal with the embarrassment of it not being mine? 
[00:03:30]  But that'll be over with.  We're just talking about the experience in a delivery room.  Oh, it's just horrible.  You're a father of two, as it is.  Yeah.  I mean, did you look at your wife back then differently after you watched the birth of your baby?  Were you in the delivery room?  Yeah, yeah, for both of them.  And you watched and saw them coming, you know, out?  It was funny because, yeah, they had the whole thing over her.  And the doctor was kind of funny because before the baby, he pulled out a rabbit and went da-da, like that.  That old gag. 
[00:04:00]  All right, listen, listen, forget it.  It's the hot dog down the hallway gag.  Yeah, we're not getting any insight from Rich Voss.  Anyway, so yesterday we woke up lactating women, knowing they have to start their day just like anyone else.  And we were just going to start the radio show, but Dave from Long Island has a suggestion who we should be waking up today.  Dave, what's going on?  Hi.  I was wondering if you could wake up the amputees.  Amputees?  See?  There are many amputees out there. 
[00:04:30]  Are you one, Dave, or are you just being one?  When you, you know, use the portable power sawer and, you know, you're trying to save some wood and you have to cut this real small piece and it kind of gets real close to your fingers.  How many do you lose?  Two.  Yeah, but like how many?  I mean, how much of the fingers?  Just the tips.  Nah.  Nah, we want real amputees.  I like, I like.  We want the, we want the whole finger, the whole hand, the whole arm, or leg. 
[00:05:00]  I like to play through my finger.  You, uh, you should use push sticks, my friend.  Yeah, well.  They teach you that in wood shop.  Yeah.  Use the push sticks.  That's one of those after thoughts.  All right.  Uh, in honor of Dave losing two fingertips, we'll, uh, wake up the amputees today.  Thank you.  See, because, Rich, we've, we figured out a long time ago, you know, you're waking up horrific people.  You're waking up different types of people every morning. 
[00:05:30]  You never really think of that.  You just think of, you know, you're waking up, uh, people in general.  The perfect human being.  Yeah.  The guy with a, with a job and a wife and a few kids and a minivan and all that crap.  But no, we also realize we're waking up coroners and, and, and, and, and pedophiles and serial killers.  Awful people.  But also nice things like lactating mothers, the hot, uh, the hot chicks, uh, going to  high school.  Milfs sending their, their kids off to school.  And now today, right now, someone's on the edge of the bed strapping a leg on. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  And to you, good morning.  Good morning.  And welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  Even worse, they're just waking up to our voices, uh, just coming out of some nice dream  where maybe they're running in a field.  Oh, and there's wild horses all around and it's a beautiful spring day.  And while they're still groggy, they reach down to itch their calf.  Right.  And it's just, they, they're scratching a sheet going, oh, what?  Oh, that's right.  Oh, that's right.  My life sucks.  Cause I lost a leg.  Or they can't scratch their leg. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Or they have an itch on their leg, but can't scratch it.  Only one fourth of the calls will be able to answer the phone.  So, yeah, we'll wake up the amputees today.  Maybe you don't know, maybe you don't know where your leg is.  Yeah.  Cause you went to bed, you were tired and misplaced it or this dog carried it off again.  It's all chewed up.  You know, that happens.  You know how people have dogs?  Like I used to have dogs growing up and they would chew up everything.  Like you'd get your, your shoes and look and just go, oh, you son of a bitch dog.  You, you chewed up my shoes. 
[00:07:00]  You know, people with like important things like prosthetic legs and arms, their dog, they  wake up one morning and the dog is just chewing on it and it's got teeth marks in it and they  still have to put it on and go to work.  Yeah.  I'm like talking about how my dog ate my arm.  I'm late for work.  What happened?  Oh, my dog ate my leg.  My dog was running around.  Or it's one of those dogs.  Do you ever have a dog that like gets something in his mouth and, and insists you're playing  with him even though you're pissed and you're like, give me that. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  Hold, be nice.  And you creep up to him and then he runs off at the last second and you're like chasing  him around cause he's got his arm in your mouth.  Just like, come here, come here.  I'm late for work.  I need my arm.  Wake up.  Have you ever woke up and saw your wallet and money all chewed up from your dumb dog?  The dog eating.  No, when I had dogs, I didn't have money.  I was like a kid.  Yeah.  All right.  They do that.  They eat your money.  That's wonderful.  And you can just chew the wallet up.  Jewish dog.  And I think we want to hear. 
[00:08:00]  What's this Jew dog?  I think in the first hour here too, we also want to hear from the amputees.  Yeah.  We want to hear the stories.  Just a couple stories.  Just a couple.  Cause we don't want to horrify the people too much out there.  No, we did that yesterday.  Yeah.  Speaking of which, this was a story that was, it's a couple days old.  Men survived gruesome suicide attempt.  Did you hear about this one?  Two Atlanta men survived an attempt to kill themselves Friday.  Two of these guys by cutting off their arms with a circular saw.  The men managed to sever three of their arms about six inches above the wrist, he said. 
[00:08:30]  Well, of course, only three.  Yeah.  There's two guys.  One guy's working with your foot.  One guy decides he's going to, yeah, he's going to.  Wow.  Yeah.  The two men ages 40 and 41 left a suicide note with the manager of their Atlanta apartment building saying they were committing suicide because their business had failed and they were recently diagnosed with HIV.  Okay.  Oh, well, that's a great way to kill yourself if you got AIDS, you greedy bastard.  Spread blood all over the place. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  You're going to give it to each other really bad now.  That makes cleanup a little hazardous.  Yeah.  After reading the note, the manager called police who found the two men in their apartment with a lot of blood.  Their names were not released.  Police spokesman Steve Coleman said both were in stable condition and will undergo psychiatric evaluation.  Were they able to reattach the arms or anything?  I don't know.  That circular saw makes it possible to reattach them.  I think so.  Unless it's got like a dado blade in there or something that's going to take big chunks out of it. 
[00:09:30]  My friend took off four fingers like that or three or four and they reattached them, but they weren't exactly where they were supposed to be.  Like somebody had to move over and so on.  What, they rearranged his fingers?  Yeah, yeah.  Dirk, he cut off four with a power like that, you know, the saw.  And he's just in shock.  He yells to some kid, get me a bag of ice and a helicopter.  I want to take him to New York.  And they put on like this finger over here.  Oh, this is great.  His pointer on the middle finger part and then his middle finger they put on the ring finger. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They had to shift it over one.  Why did they have to shift it?  Did he ever tell you?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't you just put them right back where they were?  Probably.  I don't know.  Maybe it was so damaged.  Did he lose one?  Yeah.  He lost one, so maybe it was so damaged.  Oh, he lost one.  And so they probably decided which fingers were more important.  That's what I'm thinking.  All right.  Let's say hi to Simon in Georgia.  Simon, what's up?  Morning.  Good morning.  Hi, Simon.  I have an amputee story for you. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  All right.  My father is an amputee.  It started about 30 years ago.  He worked on a shrimp boat.  And whenever they pulled in the net, he would have to keep the cable straight.  And it caught his foot and pulled him up to his waist.  So that kind of deadened one of his legs.  But he was able to keep it.  Fast forward about 25 years.  He had to have it removed.  And he liked to drink a lot, which is always cause for a good story.  He was at his hunting camp one night. 
[00:11:00]  He was at a fire.  He had just gotten his leg imitated.  So he had the temporary leg, which had to be strapped on with belts and suspenders, essentially.  And he was talking crap to one of his buddies.  I don't even think he knew the guy.  He was doing the, hey, I love you, you're the man kind of crap.  And his wife got really mad about it.  And she had the amputee leg.  We committed to her. 
[00:11:30]  Gotta keep going.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  Oh, my God.  She threw it like a football and hit him upside the head with it.  Wow.  I just cut off one of my ears.  Thank you, Simon.  All right.  All right.  Oh, my God.  That guy, see, that's a prime example of somebody that really can't tell a story.  You see him at parties sometimes, or it's the guy at work that comes over during a break, 
[00:12:00]  maybe, and just starts telling a story.  And everyone knows he's the guy that can't really convey a story in an entertaining fashion.  And you just sit there and go, oh, just finish, just finish.  That was like going to see a bad movie, and the whole time you're like, I really think  it's going to get good.  Something's got to happen.  And then the credits start rolling.  Like, what happened?  This sucked.  Oh, the guy's talking for 40 minutes, and then he says, let me make this short.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  To make a long story short.  Yeah.  Okay, thanks.  Too late for that, Pally. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Rhode Island.  Maybe Rhode Island will help us out here.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Bob.  All right, Bob.  Hey, I had a pit bull who decided one day it would be good to eat my mother-in-law's fake  teeth while she was sleeping.  Eat her dentures?  We couldn't get the dentist to make her teeth for like two months.  She had to run around with no teeth at all.  She couldn't eat any like steak or chips or anything like that.  Yeah.  She was so pissed for like forever at me for that one.  Did you check after the dog went outside if any teeth were in his stool? 
[00:13:00]  No, we didn't.  My dog also ate like rat poison and bleach and everything else.  She really didn't care.  So we didn't really check too much after she ate stuff.  That'd be really funny if, as the dog was trying to go to the bathroom, the teeth kind  of just came out halfway and people just thought it was an ugly dog that walked backwards.  Watch out.  It's some set of choppers on that dog.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Coke Logic.  Coke Logic.  What's up? 
[00:13:30]  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I wanted to know if Rich would be so brave to tell the audience how all the tips of  his fingers were cut off.  Oh, so funny.  See, because Rich has really short fingers.  Yeah, and how did they get like fingernails at the end of them?  Yeah.  It's so funny.  The first night he noticed we were out to dinner, me, him, and Hope, he looks in his  hands and goes, my hands, he goes, look at those stubby little fingers.  Dude, you have the smallest hands.  I don't have the biggest hands.  Kid hands.  You got really small hands. 
[00:14:00]  It's like, well, they should be finger painting in kindergarten class.  That was perfect delivery by Coke Logic.  Yes.  See, he knows.  All right.  Let's say hi to George in Jersey.  George, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How you doing this morning?  All right, George.  I got an amputee story for you myself back in.  Hold on.  Did you ever think we would be talking to you right off the bat today?  See, we woke you up.  I was looking forward to it.  You said amputees, man.  I just had to jump out of the bed. 
[00:14:30]  Thank God I have my legs.  I mean, I'm missing an arm, but, you know, hey, it is what it is.  All right.  What happened to you, George?  Helping a friend of mine clear some trees on his property out in PA, and as the trees  were down, branches still there, he was cutting the branches, and they were kind of like falling  on them.  So I just came over and was pulling the branches as he cut them, and he went from one branch  to the next, and the chainsaw kicked back and just one swipe just took my arm off.  With a chainsaw.  With a chainsaw. 
[00:15:00]  Right below the elbow, and now almost 20 years with a prosthetic, it sucks, and I hate it,  you know, but...  Oh, man.  You saw your own arm just fall to the ground?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It's like laying there, the fingers are twitching, and, you know, it's like an out-of-body experience.  Hold on.  The fingers continue to twitch?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  It actually flipped his friend the bird before it went dead.  Huh?  I was just looking at it, and, you know, just like total state of shock, and you know, 
[00:15:30]  it's bad.  You see that really dark red blood.  It's like, all right, this isn't good, and next thing I know, I woke up in the hospital  and just like looked down, and there's a bandage, and there's just nothing there, and it's freaky.  It took a long, long time.  I mean, I don't care, you know, the prosthetic I got, I got a hook.  Wow, big deal, you know?  Right.  And it's just, it was fun, but it was so nice to hear you guys want to wake us up today. 
[00:16:00]  Good morning.  I'm part of the world again.  Good morning.  Did you guys try to reattach the arm, or...?  Nah, you couldn't.  It basically looked like roast beef.  No kidding.  A chainsaw probably doesn't make that cleaner cut, I would say.  It was shredded.  It went about, the initial was like, it hit me on the backside where the bone is, so it  didn't waste any time going through.  Oh, wow.  And George, where is that arm today? 
[00:16:30]  You got me, maybe it ended up at Wendy's or something, you know?  What do you do with that arm?  I don't know.  I wonder if some people take their body part and they bury it somewhere.  Save it for, you know, when you pass on, you could be buried with all your parts.  Or maybe just bury it in the backyard.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Maybe it's on the property under the foundation of his house, for all I know.  Dog digs it up.  Do you ever think Dr. Kimball was going to catch you?  Jesus, George.  Dr. Kimball. 
[00:17:00]  I didn't kill his wife.  I didn't really.  All right.  The one-armed man.  Thanks, George.  Thanks for sharing.  I didn't know the fingers twitched like that.  Yeah, you know, it's still, I mean, the nerve endings.  I even asked the doctor.  I said, why is stuff still, like, I saw it moving.  And he goes, well, it still works for a couple of seconds.  And I'm like, oh, I took solace in that.  Thanks a lot, Doc, you know?  Yeah.  But it still works on the ground, you know?  It's not on me anymore.  You should have used it on yourself.  It really would have felt like someone different. 
[00:17:30]  How about those fake arms with the hands on them?  How much money?  Like, why would, I mean, are they better than the hooks or are the hooks better?  No, those things just look, they look better, but you can't do anything with it.  It's a mannequin hand.  Right?  Yeah, I just.  They don't have that figured out yet.  The best is the hook.  I still have the hook because I'm so used to using it as it is.  But how can you use the hook off your stub?  No, he's got, George is sort of lucky because you have your elbow still, right?  Yeah, I got the elbow, so.  That's kind of, if you're going to be an amputee, that's a good thing, right? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I lose the whole thing.  You know, I've met people, you know, they have those little groups, you know, support groups like, you know, you can do this.  It's like, I don't know, man, it's crazy.  You can do this.  Yeah, like, you know, a self-help group.  It's like, what are you kidding me?  You know, like, I met this one guy and he's like right from the shoulder and he's just like, oh, I get along fine.  It only took me a little while to get used to doing it.  I'm like.  Yeah, right.  All right, man, you're out of your frigging mind. 
[00:18:30]  And you look at him like, God, I'm so much better off than he is, right?  Yeah, I felt better about myself.  You know, it's like funny, like my buddy would say, oh, you still can make a muscle.  And I'm like, shut up, you know.  How many years before you got tired of dressing like a pirate for Halloween?  At the self-help groups, like when someone says something and people can't clap, do they bang their head on the table? 
[00:19:00]  All right, George.  And you get paid for comedy, Rich.  All right, George, thank you.  Guys, I'm punching out.  Thanks for your time.  Have a good one.  Right on, man.

[00:21:00]  Because this one's too good.  Steve in Florida, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey, Steve.  Hey, I just want to say real quick.  My pleasure to see you a while back at the Miami Improv, man.  You rock.  Thanks a lot, man.  Voss is very, very funny.  Next weekend, he's playing Wisecrackers in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  Wisecrackers.  What's up, Steve?  Anyway, boys, I was nine years old.  And me and my dad, I live down in Florida.  It's a thing called the Chain of Lakes.  It's a bunch of lakes.  And it's put together by little canals. 
[00:21:30]  And we was going through the canal.  And I thought they were little lizards.  But they were actually alligators.  I mean, they were little bitty lizards.  It looked up to me.  And I reached down to grab one.  And I'll come up and got my arm about four inches below the elbow.  Oh, his phone sucks.  But he lost his arm.  An alligator bit it off.  How big was the alligator?  She wasn't that big.  But I was a little kid.  I mean, like, probably nine foot long.  A little nine-year-old arm.  That comes off real easy.  And the alligator, you said, wasn't that big, but it was nine feet long? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That gets big down there in Florida.  Yeah, but that's a pretty big alligator to a kid.  That's a pretty big alligator to an adult.  Who are you kidding?  And what?  You guys were walking through the canals?  No, no, no.  My dad, we was in a boat.  And we went through the little canal where the tall salt grass is.  And I just seen, like, I don't know, probably 10 or 15 little tiny lizards.  I saw the little baby alligators and went to grab one, and the mother came up and snatched his arm off.  Oh, man. 
[00:22:30]  That must have scared the bejesus out of you.  Yeah, I went into shock.  I remember the gator coming up, and I remember the bite.  But as far as that, after that, I don't remember nothing because I went into shock.  Did you make the news down there?  Yeah.  Of course.  Well, I'm 36 now, and that happened when I was nine.  So what do you got, the hook, the plastic arm, what?  I got the hook.  Actually, I'm a truck driver, and I'm actually out here at the TA truck stop in Ontario. 
[00:23:00]  I'm going to go see little Jimmy tonight.  Oh, there you go.  Hey, say hi to him.  Tell him you were on the air.  Yeah.  Have him sign your hook.  All right, guys.  He'll have to point you out from the stage because a lot of fans will be at that show tonight.  Yep.  All right.  I'm looking forward to it.  But you lost your arm by an alligator biting it off.  Have you adjusted?  What's that?  Have you adjusted?  Yeah.  I mean, that was when I was nine.  He's had the hook longer than he had the arm.  True.  And what is it?  I still have my elbow.  Like I said, I still have my arm. 
[00:23:30]  I got probably four inches below my elbow.  Oh, okay.  How big is your other arm?  It's got to be.  Do you got like a nickname that they call you for getting your arm bitten off by an alligator?  No.  Uh-uh.  No?  They didn't call you Gator Boy or something?  Nah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Trip Runer.  All right.  We're going to go on to...  Trip Runer.  Fishing excursion Runer.  Boy, that puts a real damper on the fishing trip. 
[00:24:00]  Let's...  We're going to do a speed round.  Then we're going to move on to some things.  George in Queens.  What's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I was eight visiting my uncle on his farm, and he was working on his wheat thresher.  The tool slipped, and he lost his left arm from the shoulder down, and all I saw was  red mist and mint.  Oof.  And you're...  I was holding the tools, and he's in front of me, and he turns around to take something,  and like, I watch him slow motion as he suddenly pitches forward. 
[00:24:30]  He sticks out his hand, which I guess he thought was going to catch the blade guard.  And it goes right in between two blades, and it's just...  Oh.  ...disappeared, and all I see is a red mist and mint.  And the worst part is, my aunt, who's in the cab, jumps down and screams to me to put  my hand on the wound and stop the bleeding.  I'm eight.  I got my hands on his shoulder.  I can feel the blood pulse in my palms.  So, my aunt ties her handkerchief around my hands to his shoulder until the paramedics 
[00:25:00]  get there.  Why does she use her own hand?  Well, because he's in shock.  I mean, it's just...  I'm standing there.  She's going inside to call the paramedics.  He's bleeding profusely.  What am I going to do?  Oh, so your bare hand is on his stump.  All right, so...  And it's pumping blood out through your fingers.  No, my question was, why didn't the aunt do that?  But obviously...  She's got to go call.  She has to run back and call somebody. 
[00:25:30]  So, she thought...  She did the right thing, I guess.  Yeah.  Horrific for you, but probably saved your uncle's life.  Nice day on the farm.  Sounds like a Norman Rockwell painting, doesn't it?  Right.  Little kid holding...  In horror.  Imagine a Norman Rockwell painting of that little freckle-faced kid just horrified holding  his uncle's bloody stump.  That's what he is.  That's one of the lost Norman Rockwells.  That's when he got...  A little dark.  Yeah, when he got miserable at the end of his life.  That freckle-faced kid from the dentist's office. 
[00:26:00]  It was his blue...  It was his blue period.  He decided, you know what?  Screw America.  You don't have hope for this country anymore.  I call this one Thresher of Death.  Let me show you the horrific side of Americana.  Ah, stay in the dentist's chair.  They're in the operating room.  Yeah, in the operating room.  A horrified child with a bloody hand.  Oh, but it happens at a soda shop, so...  Yeah, yeah.  Just at the mall shop.  Yeah.  I got married last year, and my uncle went to give me a handshake to congratulate me, 
[00:26:30]  and his stump rushed against my shoulder, and I had flashbacks on my window.  You got, like, traumatic or that stress disorder.  Was your uncle just screaming the whole time, or...?  No, he looked like...  It happened...  He looked at what used to be his arm, and hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.  Did he go...?  And he doesn't remember anything from that moment to about two weeks after.  His memory is just gone, and I couldn't touch him. 
[00:27:00]  Like, I couldn't shake his hand, nothing, for, like, 20 years.  I mean, I was like...  Every time I looked at him, I just see the blood, and I could feel it.  Like, even talking about it, I can feel his, like, the blood pulsing against my paw.  It was a paw...  His pulse was actually, like, pumping blood out into your hand, and...  Oh, wow, that is twisted.  Like, trying to hold the water back from a hose or something?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that is twisted.  You tried doing dumb things like that as a kid, and the blood's just pumping and pouring  through your fingers. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, jeez.  Thanks, boys.  Oh, that is great.  He would have turned to you and said, mere flesh wound.  Yeah.  Brave guy.  That's a great story.  Let's go to Gary in Philly, listening on WYSP.  Gary, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  A couple years ago, I was using a table saw, and I was kind of not setting my knees on  the ground the right way, and kind of leaning over it a little bit, and the thing moved on  me.  I fell almost on top of it, and I threw my left hand down in front of the blade.  Oh, wow. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, that's rough.  Two of my fingers came all to hit me in the face.  I have a pinky, and I have a...  You're getting a lot of laughs from the studio.  Oh, it's that awful.  I woke up this morning to some great memories, guys.  Let me just tell you.  Yeah, we're giving everybody flashbacks.  Well, we're the first morning show to realize that we're waking up all sorts of people.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a wonderful thing.  My thumb is now a reconstructed Frankenstein nightmare made up of the rest of my fingers. 
[00:28:30]  What did they do?  Like, took a bunch of your fingers and just tried to fashion a thumb?  Well, it's actually my index finger made it out all right, so they kind of used that.  As a thumb.  Now it looks like a glove over my thumb of my index finger.  Oh.  It's really weird looking.  And you got a pinky?  I got a pinky that doesn't extend all the way, and I have three little Voss fingers left.  Oh, wow.  Little stubs.  They're below where you would put your ring, so it's pretty bad.  Wow. 
[00:29:00]  I've been looking at all, man.  That's a bitch, man.  Yeah.  Table saw.  I always had a fear of a table saw.  I always, like, was scared.  I would reach over.  As you're doing that final push through the blade, and you are kind of leaning over the table,  that my feet would slip out from under me, and my chin would, like, go whack and just hit the blade.  That was, I was awful in woodshop because I was just petrified of the machinery.  And see, there's good reason to be. 
[00:29:30]  I'm in this lady's garage, and there's blood on the ceiling, on her car, on the wall.  Oh, God.  I run over to her door.  The blood's coming out so hard that the blood hits her door before I can even get to it.  She opens the door.  Her kids are standing there horrified.  I'm standing there with no fingers.  Oh, wow.  Well, Gary, that's a great story.  Thank you.  Well, good morning to you.  Good morning, amputees.  Good morning, amputees.  Let's go to Rachel in Massachusetts.  Rachel.  Hey.  Hey, Rachel.  Good morning. 
[00:30:00]  Listen, I had an ear cut off and sold back on.  Really?  Marvin Nash?  No, I tried to trailer.  It hit me.  I tried to trailer broadsided me, and my head went through a window and off the grill.  Oh.  And the ear come off.  Poof.  And the ear just came flying off.  It was hanging on by a little tiny piece of cartilage.  Cartilage.  I love the accent up there.  A little cartilage.  My ear.  Cut my ear off.  Do they reattach it? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, they reattach it.  I have no feeling in it at all, so I had a tattoo put on it.  I call it fun with scar tissue.  Does it look weird?  Does it look like, you know.  No, it looks normal.  Yeah.  It's just I can't feel it, so I got to keep it covered with sunscreen and, you know, I put  a tattoo on it.  Not like, what's his name, that thing from Goonies.  It doesn't look like his ear, does it?  No, there's a lot of red blood dogs going on here.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Well, thanks for sharing, Rachel. 
[00:31:00]  Anytime.  We're in the middle of a speed round.  Kent, the movie guy.  Kent, what's up?  Hey, when I was six or seven years old, this guy who's kind of like my uncle, one of my  dad's co-workers, is over with his motorcycle, showing it off to my dad.  And he was starting it up, and it wasn't working, and then he's working on the engine, working  on the engine, and then it starts up, and he loses all his fingers in the bike chain.  Oh.  And I'm there watching him, and they're stuck in the chain like bad, like just mangled, 
[00:31:30]  bleeding all over the place.  He's screaming.  My dad's running around looking for the phone, and I'm six years old, crying my eyes out.  And eventually...  Stupid parents and their brothers and friends and stuff doing things to horrify kids.  Another Norman Rockwell painting on the way.  Go ahead, sir.  The best part was he eventually couldn't stand the pain anymore and wanted to get away from  the bike, and he put his foot up on the tire and kicked off and pulled his hand out, severing  his fingers the hard way.  He was never able to reattach them because the tears were so bad. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, it's true.  And I was forced to collect them.  You're six, and you've got to collect your uncle's fingers.  Yeah, pretty much.  It was the worst thing ever.  Like they're Lincoln logs.  Like he's picking up his Lincoln logs after playtime.  Pick up your uncle's fingers.  And another Norman Rockwell painting.  Yeah, it was wonderful.  Running around with blood just spewing from his fingers.  And then you've got the kid maybe bending down, and maybe you see just a little crack.  A little butt crack.  A little innocent butt crack.  A little butt crack, yeah.  Sticking out of his oshkosh bagosh. 
[00:32:30]  The only good part of it is because he lost his fingers, he wasn't able to use his Atari  anymore, so he gave it to me.  Oh, I see.  I got something out of it.  Took lemons and...  All right, punch it out, guys.  God, that's lemony.  Terrific.  Did he send his wife over for...  I don't think...  Yeah.  All right, let's go to...  Can I just have that one, please, Doc?  Could you...  Let's go to Nate in Syracuse.  Nate, what's up?  Hey, I basically threw the lighter and forgot to let go of the M80. 
[00:33:00]  Wait, you threw the lighter instead of the M80?  Yeah, that's what people told me.  I started partying first thing in the morning, and this was 10 in the morning, started partying  at 10 in the night.  I thought it was time to start throwing M80s.  M80s are...  That was always the horror of 4th of July, but it was such a thrill also when someone  would come over with a little lunch bag full of M80s, and I would put them on the ground 
[00:33:30]  or put them in garbage pails or mailboxes or somewhere where you could light it and run  the F away, but there was always the guy that would take them, light them, and then  hold it and watch the fuse and go, and try to get it to explode in midair.  I was that guy.  You were that?  Oh, yeah.  See?  You know, you're crazy.  I was always trying to shock him.  That's something I would never do.  Firecracker.  Firecracker one time, I held it in my hand and went to light it with a sparkler, and I 
[00:34:00]  couldn't tell that it was lit because the sparkler was sparkling, so I'm trying to light  it, and not knowing it's lit, the thing just all of a sudden goes, boom, in my hand.  Scared the crap out of me, and my fingers just went completely numb.  No damage or anything, but completely numb.  I couldn't feel them the whole night.  M80s were like the heroin of firecrackers.  Yeah, that was the big time.  That was like the most derelict guy in the neighborhood that would show up with the  M80s.  With the bag of M80s.  Like he was like, you know, 14-year-old and already had tattoos and a beard. 
[00:34:30]  He quit school already.  He had the chain on his wallet.  Yep.  And he shows up, and you know, there's trouble, and he's got M80s and a gun.  There was the guy that would get into, like, he'd involve you by getting into the throw  position, and then go, all right, light me.  Light me.  Yeah.  So you'd have to light it, and you're shaking, your hand's shaking at like 10, and you're  holding a cigarette, and you're shaking, trying to light the fuse, and when it's lit, he'd  look at it, and he's like, he's already cocked back like a catapult, and he'd wait till the 
[00:35:00]  last possible second, heave the thing up in the air, and like five feet away from him,  boom!  Boom!  The loudest explosion.  Your ears are ringing.  It was so thrilling and so horrifying at the same time.  I'd try to light a firecracker.  The numbness, like you say, my friend, his battery died, and he opens it up to look inside  it, and lights his lighter.  Oh, no, that's flammable gases.  That's like everyone knows the dumbest thing to do with a car battery. 
[00:35:30]  All right, let's go to Jake in Baltimore.  Jake, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  How you doing?  Good morning.  Hey, I want to say hello to everyone that listens to us on WJFK.  We don't give them enough attention.  Yeah.  What's going on, Jake?  I'm on YSP, actually.  I'm on YSP.  Oh, that's all good.  I just thought Baltimore was close enough to the D.C. area.  I was just thinking.  That's all.  I'm glad you're listening on YSP as well in Philly.  Go ahead, Jake.  Back when I was 12, every Thanksgiving we used to go to my rich uncle's house for Thanksgiving. 
[00:36:00]  So after dinner, my sister, mom, and cousins helped clear the table.  She sticks the turkey down, you know, a piece of the turkey down the garbage disposal.  Uh-oh.  Well, sure as hell, the thing gets jammed.  Well, my stepfather had a few beers, and I'm, you know, going to be the superhero and fix it.  He sticks his hand down there with the switch off, but it was already wound up.  Like, the disposal was already set.  As he pulls the piece of turkey out, the thing activates, and he pulls his hand down.  And all there is, the two tips of his left index finger and his pointer finger are missing. 
[00:36:30]  And the garbage disposal is going about 100 miles an hour.  There's blood shooting all over the kitchen.  And needless to say, it was probably the worst Thanksgiving of my life.  There it is.  Another one.  Wonderful Thanksgiving scene.  Just ruined by spraying blood.  Another wonderful Norman Rockwell painting right there.  Piece of Americana, Opie.  Thanksgiving.  The smiling faces over the turkey.  Mmm.  There's the just-cooked turkey with all the dressings, and there's the dude trying to find his fingers in the background. 
[00:37:00]  The garbage disposal.  Horrified look.  His mouth twisted in horror and pain.  Captured perfectly by Norman Rockwell.  That might be a better anime art piece.  I want to move on to other things, but they're coming in fast.  A lot of people have had pieces chopped off of them or had to watch.  Let's say hi to Jersey.  Justin, what's up? 
[00:37:30]  Hi, how you doing?  Hey.  I work at a trauma center on a trauma team, so I see amputations a lot.  And there was a guy about two years ago who was using a chainsaw to cut limbs off a tree.  But he was like kind of upside down and cutting upwards at a branch.  God knows why.  And it hit a knot and bounced back and shaved the whole side of his face off.  I mean, I've seen, you know, things you wouldn't believe, and that was by far the worst.  I mean, like- 
[00:38:00]  Chainsaw to the face.  And they brought in the rest of his face, like in a bag with ice.  How much of the face was missing?  Like his whole-  Like a chicken cutlet?  Oh, God.  A cutlet.  Just put a cutlet on there and sew it on.  Jason, you can look at his cheek and see his, like, back molars.  Like in his-  Oh!  That's like horror movie stuff where you see teeth through the cheek like a zombie.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was-  I mean, honest to God, it looked like that. 
[00:38:30]  He, uh, they ended up taking skin from his thigh or something like that and making his face.  He kind of, I mean, it's like a burn victim now, it kind of looks like, but it's better  than what he had, I guess.  Nothing worse than those chainsaw kickbacks, man.  Yeah.  I remember when the chainsaw would kick back, it was the scariest damn thing.  Bang!  Oh, that was close.  I mean, this guy was inches from the blade and it went right through his goggles and everything.  Do you know what happened to the guy?  Like, how did they reconstruct his face?  Oh, they ended up taking, um, they took skin, like, from his thigh and they kind of reconstructed 
[00:39:00]  a new cheek.  Well, they always say, like, from his thigh, but we all know it's buttocks.  Absolutely.  Butt cheek.  It's butt cheek.  Put it on his other cheek and-  That's where they get some meat for you if you need a little extra somewhere else.  All right, Justin, thank you.  All right, no problem.  Let's go to Jackson in Brooklyn.  What's up, Jackson?  All right, hey, what's up, boys?  How are you, man?  My buddy got caught in between some machinery and it sheared his leg off at the hip. 
[00:39:30]  Did you see this happen?  No, no, no.  No, I was there afterwards.  You can't have much time.  They put him in a coma to try and save what was left.  While he was in a coma, his mother and his dog died.  Jesus.  What did he do with the leg?  That's what I need to know.  That's a lot of leg.  Like a fingertip, you're kind of just like throwing it in the woods or whatever.  But I mean-  I think the hospital keeps it.  You think the hospital keeps it?  You're not allowed to go home with that eventually?  You can't go home with your leg? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, I don't think so.  They probably-  It's yours.  It's a cafeteria.  I'm sure there's some kind of like medical issue.  You can't be just handing body parts back to you.  It is yours, though.  You're hanging up on the wall.  That's awful.  That's like when you pull a leg off a Barbie doll.  That's the kind of like wound he's talking about, sheared off at the hip.  Yeah.  Yeah, no clean cut there, boys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Eric in Jersey.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how we doing?  Hey.  I was living in Maine, and I was helping a buddy do a hardwood floor all through his 
[00:40:30]  first floor of his house, and we were doing it for like 10 hours straight, and I was  caught in the last piece of flooring, and the floor jammed up.  It got caught up on a knot, and it kicked back, and it ended up kicking back into my stomach  and impaled me with the piece of wood.  How far in did it go?  Probably about three, four inches.  Oh.  Good thing you're not a vampire.  There, you had it disintegrated right there on the floor.  Turned to dust.  Ashes.  I still got the scar. 
[00:41:00]  All right, sure.  I don't doubt it.  I sure you do.  But no problems with the stomach?  No, no.  Everything was, I was in the hospital for four days trying to recoup.  Yee.  Well, there you go.  Hey, babe, check out my wood.  All right, thank you.  Horrible.  Now, you don't want to do anything anymore now with power saws or...  No, stay away from that stuff.  Well, they made them a little safer.  Other people do it.  They made them a little safer.  People just defeat all the safety things, though.  When I was working construction, I just saw people doing horrid things with, like, nail 
[00:41:30]  guns.  And, you know, they take the guard off of the circular saws.  Well, why would you do that?  Just to make it faster.  Okay.  You know, a lot of the safety stuff on this machinery makes it a little inconvenient to  use.  And people just...  There were guys that would have nail gun fights.  You know, the safety is supposed to be that it's got to be on a flat surface and you got  to push down before you could actually actuate the trigger. 
[00:42:00]  And they would take their two fingers and pull back on the safety and just start shooting  the nail gun and things.  And you wonder why, you know, people end up in the hospital.  You see those x-rays of five nails in someone's skull.  Those are the guys with the M80s.  Yep.  Same guys.  They had to get a job after school.  Well, all right.  This answers this question.  Then we can hopefully move on.  Tiny in Yonkers.  Tiny, what's up?  I bet he's a big guy.  Yeah.  I used to work in the morning.  And you're... 
[00:42:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Tiny, how big are you?  Because you're not tiny.  400.  400?  400 pounds.  And they call him Tiny, Opie.  It's hysterical.  That joke will never get old.  I'm sure in the Old West there was just a guy, hey, Tiny.  Remember the guy in Buffalo they named Tiny?  Tiny.  He was like our security when we were doing that.  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, TNA.  Oh, thank you.  TNA with ONA.  The guy had to be seven foot tall, white guy, easily 400 pounds. 
[00:43:00]  Just a monster.  Called him Tiny.  And his name was Tiny, too.  What's up, Tiny?  Yeah.  You are allowed to keep your body part, but you can't take them home.  You can keep them either in a morgue or in a funeral home until you die.  And then they put them in the same casket.  Where are they storing all these limbs?  Ah, a file cabinet somewhere.  You think so?  Yeah.  Mummify them?  Yeah, they put them in, you know, liquid, dude.  I would think you'd want to be buried with all your stuff, you know, especially if it's 
[00:43:30]  something like a whole leg.  Well, just in case, you know.  Yeah, just in case that's how things work in the afterlife.  Yeah.  You kind of want to have that with you.  Just in case.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Tiny.  Have a good one.  All right.  I guess we could end right there.  Tiny.  Big guy.  Tiny.  Tiny.  How funny is that?  We got a guy that bit his own tongue off.  We got a little brother lost his ear, lost my eye in a car accident.  Saw a girl lose her arms in a car accident. 
[00:44:00]  You want any of these before we take a break?  Yeah.  I think we did it.  Yeah.  All right.  So there you go.  Good morning to the amputees that were waking up this morning with the Opie and Anthony  show.  Quite a few.  It's unbelievable.  I thought Dave, you know, gave us a bad suggestion, but it worked out nice.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[00:44:30]  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I want to give a big fuck you to the 400 year old cunt who nearly plowed into me.  Fuck you.  I hope you die in a home invasion.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You goddamn guinea little princess faggot in the goddamn Mazda who had to cut me off  because he doesn't feel like sitting in fucking traffic.  You fucking fag.  I hope you should take the dick out of your mouth and wrap your lips around a pistol, 
[00:45:00]  Daryl.  Fuck you.  Drop dead.  Get out of my way.  Yeah.  I want to send a big fuck you to my boss and my boss's boss.  Fuck you guys.  Fucking cunt.  Fucking dick.  Fuck them.  I want to fucking quit.  I hate that fucking place.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  I want to give a big fuck you to this asshole in front of me on I-78.  Fuck you.  It's moving.  You're putting the fucking brakes on and there isn't a person on who drives around you. 
[00:45:30]  God, fuck you.  Hey, this message is from a beautiful wife who just found out it's three months pregnant with someone else's baby.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck all you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line at 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[00:46:00]  Ah, good morning.  Rich Voss helping us out today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Morning.  Yeah.  I always think he says monsters.  That's what it sounds like.  But it says something else.  Every time I go monsters and instant feedback goes no dummy.  They say whatever.  And then I forget.  Oh, mad skills.  That's mad skills.  Oh. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, it sounds like monsters.  It sounds like monsters, right?  So last night I was really bored.  I was watching hockey.  Islanders were sucking up the joint.  So then I went on the computer.  Are you watching, like, videos on the computer more than you watch TV at this point?  Yeah.  I watch TV at night, like when I go to bed.  I don't watch TV at all when I'm just hanging around the house.  It's all computer.  I mean, I got a lot of shows I do like to check out on a weekly basis.  But then, like, last night there was really nothing on that interests me. 
[00:47:00]  So I just throw the laptop on on the couch and just start watching videos.  Yeah.  I watched The Best of Peter Griffin, Volume 6.  It's great.  Those montages, they sneak up onto YouTube.  Yeah.  And then somehow, like, we've discussed this from time to time.  Like, I started by watching Peter Griffin, Best of Family Guy 6 or whatever it was called on YouTube.  Next thing you know, I'm just watching fat guy videos. 
[00:47:30]  And I don't know how I got there.  I mean, Peter Griffin, obviously, you know, fat cartoon character, whatever.  But somehow, I guess it was a suggested video, another Peter Griffin video, and then it morphs into something else, and then it morphs into this.  Next thing you know, I'm watching just fat guys that can't leave their house.  Yeah.  When you watch a video on YouTube, like, they give you those other suggestions that are kind of similar to what you're watching.  But if you scroll down far enough, it kind of becomes an abstract version of what you're watching.  And you click that, and now their suggestions are totally different from where you started. 
[00:48:00]  I have a lot of fun with it because it just amazes me that I started here.  Next thing you know, I'm way over here.  And then I spent, I think, about an hour just watching fat guy videos.  There's a guy in the Bronx.  He's, I guess he made the news, a big black guy.  It's called Half Ton Man.  He weighed 900 pounds, and then it took, like, the fire department, like, two hours to get him out of his house to go to a hospital, four stories. 
[00:48:30]  Wonderful.  They had to just move him down, four flights of stairs.  It took over two hours, and they bring him to a hospital.  They take care of him, and then they bring him back.  And he didn't learn his lesson.  He's now up to 700 pounds.  And it's just like an eight-minute video of this guy just eating the whole time.  And he's got a family that just enables his eating.  Yeah, because someone's got to bring him the food.  And the amount of food this guy eats on a daily basis is just unbelievable.  It's something like 14,000 calories a day. 
[00:49:00]  The average man, I think, is supposed to eat about 2,500 calories.  14,000?  He's eating 14,000.  And, like, even if you eat more than 2,500 calories a day, just walking and this and that, you're burning calories.  And they're explaining, because this guy has decided not to move.  Just lays there.  You know, just to, like, burn, like, 200 calories, it would take two days or something like that because he's just laying around.  Yeah.  And then I'm just going from video to video to video of all these fatties that are stuck in their houses. 
[00:49:30]  That's who we should wake up on Monday.  People that are homebound because they're too big to leave their house.  Yeah, that might be the one for Monday.  But that's what I did last night.  I'd be afraid there would be a fire.  You were that fat?  Yeah.  Like, if there's a fire, you're burning to death.  And, man, imagine having to, like, pick that up.  That fat would just, like, melt all over the floor.  Nah.  It'd be like a big roast. 
[00:50:00]  You know, as humans, we'll do anything to survive, I think.  I think.  Oh, there's the video.  Thanks.  What?  You guys threw it up on opiananthony.com?  Oh, that guy.  Oh, wow.  How weird is that?  I didn't know it was on our website.  Oh, I think that guy's dead.  That guy had finally died?  It was on that TV show.  Yeah, yeah.  It was on TLC.  Yeah.  It's on opiananthony.com.  Larry eats 14,000 calories a day and weighs 700 pounds.  At as heavy as he was 900.  But you get to see him at 700 pounds just eating all day long. 
[00:50:30]  But if there's a fire, I'm rolling myself right out the front door.  Oh, rolling down flights of stairs.  Oh, yeah.  I'll give that a shot.  You don't even have to stop and drop.  You just roll.  No, I would just roll off the bed and just start rolling toward the door of the apartment.  I think you'd hit the stairway and just roll.  You'd probably just break every bone because of the weight and just crush your organs as  you're rolling.  Well, it's worth a shot instead of, like, burning to death.  There was a lady that was so fat. 
[00:51:00]  I saw last week.  She was pregnant and she didn't know until she was delivering.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That story hits all the time.  Those people.  Here's a treat.  And then in the news, here's a big, fat Mexican guy.  A man in Mexico who weighed more than 1,200 pounds recently shed 400 pounds.  He was on a high-protein diet.  Manuel Uribe left his house for the first time yesterday in five years.  And tried to cross the border.  He still was unable to leave his bed.  Six people pushed his bed outside so he could watch a mariachi band play. 
[00:51:30]  Pushed his bed outside.  El Gordo is outside.  Amazing.  It was a human float in the parade.  They decorated him.  Decorate him up.  Just wheel him down the street.  Well, that was my night.  It's kind of exciting.  It's an exciting little adventure every night.  Yeah, you don't know where you're going to end up.  You start with one dumb video. 
[00:52:00]  Next thing you know, you're like completely watching something you would never have watched.  You would have never searched that on your own.  And the FBI is knocking on your door.  Yeah, hey, you seem to have found something over here.  I like putting on, like I can watch TV on my computer.  So I like pop up a little window sometimes and put a video on or a TV show.  Yeah.  And then do whatever I'm doing on the computer.  Yeah.  Take a little bit of both.  Someone is saying that guy eats 19,000 calories a day. 
[00:52:30]  What's the difference after 14,000?  Yeah, 14,000.  Wow.  All right.  I'm sorry.  He was eating 14.  He'd be a rail.  It was actually 19,000 calories.  Hey, let's not forget today is the last day to get your entry in for MacBook Karaoke, Anthony.  You go to www.923freefm.com for details.  Win the new MacBook, sleek and sexy.

Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out for yourself. 
[00:53:00]  All right?  I'd like to hear some of the entries.  Yeah.  Very excited.  People are so good.  We got some crazy stories in the news today.  Yeah.  As far as stories everyone's talking about today, it's not much out there, really.  The papers were kind of light.  No.  We had this horrific thing that happened in New York City.  Maybe that's a national story by now.  Yeah, I think that's a national story.  I always base whether something's national if we hear about it from other states. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Like, if this had happened in another state, we definitely would have heard about it.  Right.  So, yeah, it's national.  Well, I search all the papers of all the markets we're being heard in.  You know, get that little nugget from another city or whatever.  But I guess there's a shooting that happened in New York City down there in the village.  We all know the area very well.  Rich Voss, it's very close to the Comedy Cellar.  All our comedy friends, they perform there.  Supposedly, they heard the gunshots while on stage. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, they told me, last night they told me that they heard 15, you know, they heard the gunshots and it sounded like a machine gun or something.  This Arab guy was telling me that works there.  Oh, well, he would know what it sounds like, a machine gun.  And he said, you know, anybody that was down there, you know, had their cars and it was all blocked off and stuck in there and stuff.  You couldn't get out.  And they said they just heard the gunfire.  Because I think it was only like a block and a half from the club.  Yeah, they're saying like, yeah, maybe two blocks.  And Anthony made a good point in the office because, like, the big story in New York was the 101-year-old grandma getting punched by the thug. 
[00:54:30]  Big thug.  As soon as we heard that, we said black guy.  Black guy.  And then black people called up, all pissed off.  Yeah.  And I'm like, no, it's obvious that's something a black dude would do.  Sorry, but it's true.  And then when we heard this story of the gunman, we're like, ah, white guy.  When the details came in, yeah, it was like, definitely white guy.  Because this had, like, angry, crazy white guy written all over it. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, we profiled the show and we had no problem admitting that.  Oh, and our percentage is great as far as guessing this.  Because they didn't release any information on the gunman until, like, today or maybe late last night.  But the information that we had gotten before that was two auxiliary police here in New York City got auxiliary police.  They're not allowed to carry guns, which to me is crazy.  To put yourself in that vulnerable position of wearing the uniform of a cop. 
[00:55:30]  Even if it's auxiliary, you're still wearing a uniform of authority.  The average person would think that's an NYPD police officer.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And this guy is walking around with the police uniform on without a gun.  That is like, that's crazy.  Yeah.  It really is.  They're not allowed to carry guns.  I guess they have radios.  What they're supposed to do if they see anything going down is radio in.  And that's pretty much it.  Right.  They use them a lot during parades, things like that, for crowd control, stuff of that nature. 
[00:56:00]  But they were in the vicinity of this pizza store.  The gunman goes in.  There's a bar area, too, by the way.  Yeah, a bar area in there.  There's a pizza place also.  Yeah.  And shoots the guy that's working in there 15 times in the back.  Just shoots him 15 times.  That's when we said white guy.  Right there, you say white guy.  Crazy white guy.  Black people will not shoot someone 15 times.  It's a waste of bullets.  It's just, yeah, a couple of shots and you'll run out. 
[00:56:30]  A gun.  Yeah.  And it's usually maybe some kind of robbery or something.  Nothing was taken.  He just went in there and shot the guy.  Then he comes out.  He's also got a duffel bag full of ammo, which we find out later, and runs down the street.  Now he's starting to be chased by these two auxiliary police officers who, again, have no guns.  The guy doubles back.  He sees that these two auxiliary cops are chasing him.  The guy turns around.  Now the auxiliary cops are like, uh-oh. 
[00:57:00]  So they try to take some kind of cover.  The guy crosses the street and just shoots one of them in the back three times and then runs up to the next auxiliary cop who was hiding behind a car and shoots him in the head and gets a little further down the street.  By this time, the regular police are responding, told him to drop his gun.  He didn't.  And they just opened up on this guy.  Yeah, they finally got him.  But the front page of all the papers, actually, yeah, all three did it today, Newsday, Daily News, and The Post. 
[00:57:30]  They got front page the actual crazy white guy killing the auxiliary police officer.  Yeah, they have it on a video surveillance camera, which, by the way, are everywhere.  And it's just amazing.  No matter what happens in this city, you will get a video of it.  Well, they said, we mentioned this on our show a couple years ago, so it's got to be even more now.  But they said, when you walk around Manhattan, you're on camera more than you're not on camera at this point. 
[00:58:00]  But, yeah, they show the guy stretched out with the gun killing the auxiliary police officer.  Right when he's taking a shot.  Right on the front page of the newspaper.  And no one has a problem with this stuff.  But if you, God forbid, you show a busty, you know, babe in the paper, there's an outrage.  Yeah, people freak out over any type of nudity.  There would be letters like crazy if they showed a bare breast on the cover.  Yeah.  But there is a nice kid, you know, a kid who was 18 or 19 years old, getting murdered right there. 
[00:58:30]  Right there.  There it is, right there.  That is the moment that he got murdered, captured right on the cover of the paper.  The gun is pointing right at the guy as he's firing away at this kid.  And there's no outrage when it comes to showing this stuff on the front page of the paper.  And I think this does more harm if you're really going to play that game.  I'm of the school.  It should all be shown.  But if you're going to play that game, this is more harmful to a kid than a freak with breast. 
[00:59:00]  Than a little oopsie with a breast or something.  Give me a break.  Or hearing a four-letter word or something like that.  Right.  But they chased him down.  And I guess the cops ended up firing 50-some-odd times.  Oh, the cops just unloaded on them.  There's bullets all over the village right now.  Yeah.  And holes in storefront windows.  It was just an all-out shootout a couple nights ago.  Yeah.  But they killed him.  And then when I started reading about it, it said he had a couple of guns on him. 
[00:59:30]  The one he was using was a .45.  And a bag full of ammo.  That right there has white guy written all over it.  Crazy white guy.  When you have bag full of ammo, crazy white guy.  And it turns out he was like a Marine.  He got dishonorably discharged.  For what?  Do you know?  No.  I'm sure that info will get out.  Yeah.  I didn't read that far.  And he was like a compulsive liar.  People were really scared of him.  He tried to make an impression of himself like he was a nice guy and everyone's friend. 
[01:00:00]  And anyone that worked with him said, no, this guy had a real dark side to him.  Yeah.  And apparently that came out.  Wasn't he from Jersey or something?  He drove in to do this?  That would make sense.  I don't know.  Do you wait in tunnel traffic just kind of whistling a song knowing what you're about to do?  Yeah, knowing what you're going to do.  La-da-dee-dee-dee-go.  I always think about that stuff.  Like what was on the radio?  Was he singing Free Bird?  He had a friend that worked at the pizza place and got fired recently. 
[01:00:30]  So they were thinking maybe that was the motive.  Oh, this guy didn't get fired?  No, no.  Said that he, one of his friends.  Oh, I read it wrong.  I thought he got fired and that's what pissed him off.  Details sketchy.  Yeah, okay.  Sketchy at best.  But what do you think he was going next with all the ammo?  Where was she at nighttime?  Where was she headed?  His shooting spree.  He, you know, wherever.  Showdown with the cops, which he lost.  But, you know, took out two guys.  And in other news that I guess a lot of people are talking about today, Brad Delp, lead singer of Boston. 
[01:01:00]  Some more info is going.  I guess it's creepier.  More info coming in about his suicide.  We learned yesterday what?  He did it with barbecues?  Suicide by barbecue grill.  By barbecue grills.  Supposedly there was two.  Rolled a couple of barbecue grills into the bathroom.  Why the bathroom?  I guess because it's outside of the actual room he's in.  Right.  You still get the gases. 
[01:01:30]  And it's probably more fireproof tile.  I don't know.  He seems speculating.  Smaller room.  Everyone's saying how nice this guy was.  And he was probably thinking, you know, look, I'll make the cleanup nice and easy for everybody.  Yeah.  We met Brad Delp.  We've been saying this the last few days.  He was such a nice guy.  He was an unbelievably nice guy.  And I remember meeting him going, wow, you're like, you're the singer of one of the greatest freaking albums of all time.  And he was just, he was at our radio station at the Christmas party at the time just singing Beatles songs. 
[01:02:00]  Beatles covers.  And now this is seven or eight years ago.  So he seemed happy at the time.  Obviously, we haven't seen him since.  And he just seemed very happy that he was and content that he was in this Beatles cover band.  Yeah.  Anthony got to sing with him.  And we all hung out and talked on stage.  And he was just the nicest guy.  Yeah.  And he was more clean cut back then.  Yeah.  He really was.  Or is now than he was a few days ago.  The pictures they're showing. 
[01:02:30]  The pictures they're showing.  He looks like a homeless guy.  Right.  Well, Delp's suicide note, I'm a lonely soul.  Uh, Brad Delp, the lead singer for the band Boston, who killed himself last week, left  behind a note in which he called himself a lonely soul.  He was found on the floor of the bathroom, his head on a pillow.  Oh, so he did it all in the bathroom.  Oh, he did it in the bathroom.  Oh, okay.  And a note paper clipped to the neck of his shirt.  My God.  A little paper clip.  Mr. Brad Delp, uh, I'm a lonely soul.  It read, uh, in the garage, police found a note taped to the door leading into the house. 
[01:03:00]  And that note said, to whoever finds this, I have hope, hopefully committed suicide.  Plan B was to asphyxiate myself in my car.  In a third note on a door at the top of the stairs, Delp cautioned that there was carbon  monoxide inside.  Nice guy.  See?  All these notes was like a scavenger hunt for a dead body.  And it says, uh, I take complete courteous though.  I take complete and sole responsibility for my present situation.  I've lost my desire to live.  He wrote the note also included instructions on how to contact his fiance. 
[01:03:30]  There was a picture of Delp and Sullivan in the bathroom.  Unfortunately.  Oh, he brought a picture.  I just got chills.  He brought a picture of him and his fiance into the bathroom with him.  Unfortunately, she is totally unaware, unaware of what I have done.  The note said.  The notes also said the couple's, uh, cat floppy should be in a room that was, uh, safe  from the deadly gas.  He's even taking care of the cat.  What a nice guy right up to the end.  Oh, this is killing me.  He didn't do it like, like selfish people when they throw themselves out windows and 
[01:04:00]  you don't know who you're going to land on or the people that throw themselves in front  of trains and the poor engineers, you know, got this guilt complex the rest of his life.  This is one of the most courteous suicides I've ever heard of.  He even made sure his little, little cat floppy was okay.  Was okay.  Uh, I was in, uh, yeah, a room safe from the deadly gas and asked that someone find her  and make sure she was all right.  Aw.  Oh, God.  A little floppy. 
[01:04:30]  This just aches the heart today.  Yeah, poor bastard.  How old was he?  He was about, uh, mid-50s, I think.  Yeah, something like that.  I would guess like 55.  Hmm.  You know, I guess he had reached the, uh, pinnacle so many years ago and some people  can't take being on the downslide for so many years, I guess.  But it also seemed like that wasn't the most important thing in his life.  I don't know.  Maybe it was.  Some people, the fame is, is, is everything.  Like, we're learning about Richard Jenny. 
[01:05:00]  You know, it's coming out that he just was disappointed where his career was going.  And other people, they get the fame, but it's not the most important thing.  They, they have other things going on.  I don't believe that whole, I don't know about Jenny.  I didn't read up on that or anything.  I don't believe that your career, I think it's your personal life.  A career, you know, I don't think you could be so depressed.  Sometimes your career is your personal life, though.  Well, I just want to say, if you don't have an outside life besides your career, even  like friends or something to do, then, you know, it's, it's not, you know, you could 
[01:05:30]  still get TV show after TV show, but you're still going to be depressed and end up doing  it.  You got to have a balanced life.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people, they, the, the fame thing is everything.  And eventually, I don't care who, how famous you are, your fame goes away.  And then what do you have?  What do you have left at that point?  Or still, if you get as famous as whatever.  What else do you have?  Who do you got to share it with?  Who do you got?  You know what I mean?  Some people just have nothing, but their drive is so.  What's more important to me is like just security, like financial security, things like that. 
[01:06:00]  Cause I had been pretty poor in my day.  You know, I had lived out of my car for a while.  It wasn't fun.  It wasn't a long time, but it's long enough to know where you're sitting there going,  Oh man, I am on the skids over here.  And like, I'd never want to be in that position again.  So that is kind of important to me to just make sure I can like take care of myself and loved ones if I can, things like that.  But the fame portion of this whole gag, I really, that is a low priority on the list in my life. 
[01:06:30]  I could give a crap.  I think we've proven that over the years.  We could have been those guys at all the clubs and really taking advantage of stuff.  And we never really did.  Don't even care about it.  Never really did.  That is the most like, like people say the materialistic part of celebrity is like the worst thing.  No, it's the fame part is the part that has no value whatsoever. 
[01:07:00]  And it's, it's something that people crave so much and it's worthless.  It really is just worthless.  Some people are famous and don't have, you know, the proverbial pot to whiz in or the window to throw it out of.  And, uh, but that's the most important thing to them is getting more famous.  It's funny you say that because, uh, I started getting a little bit, I'll say it, uh, keep it in perspective, a little bit of fame when I was doing radio in Buffalo and I was making, um, $12,000 a year. 
[01:07:30]  Nothing worse than being poor and famous.  No, dude, to the point.  And I have a little pride.  I, I wasn't one of these guys, you know, I didn't want to ask my parents or anybody for help.  I wanted to kind of do it on my own.  But I, I, if I didn't need money when I was really desperate, I would call home and they would, they would just give me whatever they had, you know, but for the most part, I didn't want to, you know, use that card.  So I was making about 12 grand.  I was doing overnight radio in, uh, Buffalo.  And I was, I swear to you, I would be collecting change at the end of some weeks to eat, like get a can of like chef boy RD in there, you know, I was ramen noodles. 
[01:08:00]  I remember one time I was short and I was actually like digging around my, my beat up car, just looking for change among the floor mats.  And I lifted the seats up and I found a quarter there.  I was so happy because it was like in between paychecks and I just ran out of money and I needed like one or two more meals.  And then I would get my, my woo, whatever it was a week, whatever $12,000 a week, uh, adds up to, uh, $12,000 a year adds up to a weekly. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, you ever dig through old jacket pockets, hoping to find like a quarter or like 50 cents and you pull out a 10 and it's like, whoa, Hey, I'm done searching.  You go to the deli and just blow it all.  You ever wait till your grandparent falls asleep and you, and you sneak through a wall thinking you're going to try to find something.  But I, so I'm digging for change.  Like I get, I swear a can of Chef Boyardee or whatever.  And, and I'm getting recognized as I'm doing this.  Oh my God.  And the guy wants an autograph and I was this close to go, dude, do you have a buck? 
[01:09:00]  You could, you got a dollar, I'm really hungry.  I was, you're so poor.  I was driving home one night, so broke and I needed a pack of cigarettes.  And in the gas station it says, if we don't ask to check your oil, we'll give you a free quarter of oil or something or free oil.  And the guy forgot to ask me.  I said, look, you just give me a couple of bucks.  You don't have to give me the oil so I can buy cigarettes.  I was so poor.  I had no money.  You're trying to bargain for the free oil that you were going to get?  Straight in it for a cigarette.  Cause when you have, like now you take, you don't even take, food is the last thing. 
[01:09:30]  You know, you're always going to eat.  You can eat in the best restaurants.  You can do anything you want.  I did, I did all sorts of little things to survive.  Like all of a sudden it would be pizza day at the radio station cause maybe it was someone's birthday or whatever.  Everyone would leave and I would just kind of go back to where the pizza was and take two or three extra slices and bring them home so I could eat.  It was, I, I was, uh, lived in a room upstairs in a house.  I rented a room for like 50 bucks a week kind of a thing.  And, and, uh, there was another guy that lived across the hall and we shared like the bathroom up there. 
[01:10:00]  It was, it was horrible and I used to, when he, he'd leave and he'd ride his bicycle to work every day.  And when he'd leave, I would take a knife, a butter knife and break into his room and, uh, like steal his Hydrox cookies.  He didn't even have Oreos.  It was Hydrox cookies.  And I'd like steal.  The Oreo cookie for the poor.  I'd take five of them and then I'd spread out all the rest so it would kind of look like it was still the, as long as the sleeve was as long as it was before I stole his Hydrox. 
[01:10:30]  All right, we can continue down this, uh, this road for a while.  Brian in Dallas, what's up?  Yeah, you guys are talking about some horrible stories.  I wonder if you saw that.  I think it was a little girl in Minnesota.  Oh, great story.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Great story.  We, we got that story next.  Uh, yeah, the dog head.  We'll, we'll do it after the break.  Thanks for reminding me, Brian.  All right, cool, dude.  We're going to stop you.  Someone is a sick bastard, man.  Yeah, we're going to use you for a little tease. 
[01:11:00]  We got a sick story that we're going to do next.  And, and actually we're going to do a, we're going to do a twofer, two sick stories after the break.  It's, uh, Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  This week on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Show, it's the Musical Adventure Hour,  where you'll hear one ONA staff member pick the songs while the rest of the staff picks them apart.  On this week's Musical Adventure Hour.  Uh, Nathaniel.  Oh, is this a promo? 
[01:11:30]  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It sounds like it's a promo.  Oh, he's a fucking idiot.  Oh, he's such a fucking idiot.  Yeah, let's get right back into it.  Still lots of show to go.  Well, we got a twofer here.  Two sick stories on the Opie and Anthony program.  Want to start with Dead Doghead?  Yeah, this one is really, uh, twisted. 
[01:12:00]  There's someone in this girl's life that I don't think really likes her very much.  Or likes her a real lot.  One or the other.  Hey, Ant.  Hmm.  I didn't know you were talking about the, uh, the old lady story in the office.  Uh, Jeff from New York City, just on the news on Channel 11, maybe we can get the audio.  The cops have a suspect in the little old lady beating.  Yeah.  But they can't question him because he voluntarily checked himself into a psychiatric hospital?  Yeah, it's a psych hospital, so the cops can't even talk to him. 
[01:12:30]  I was half listening this morning.  I didn't know that that's what you were talking about.  Yeah, they have a suspect.  They think that this is the guy that punched the 101-year-old lady in the face.  And then went on to rob like a woman in her 80s.  Same way.  Uh, and, uh, apparently if you check yourself into a psych center, the cops can't touch you.  Holy crap.  And they can't question you.  So, he's just in there and, uh, cops gotta wait now.  How about that?  Wow.  If the guy voluntarily checked himself in, something tells me he's doing it to stay out of trouble. 
[01:13:00]  Not like, oh, wow, I think I'm sick.  Maybe I should check in.  See, that's a loophole.  I think if you voluntarily check yourself into a psych center, you're not crazy.  No.  You know, the crazy ones are the ones that are kicking and screaming the whole way.  The only way they don't check themselves in.  Hi, I'd like to check in.  Right.  It's like a hotel.  I need a major credit card, please.  Yeah, could you have a seat?  We'll get to you in a little while.  Reservation.  There's some magazines that are about five years old next to you that you can read. 
[01:13:30]  Smoking or non-smoking?  Do you like something that overlooks the park?  That's good.  Could I get the corporate rate?  You're not crazy unless you're kicking and screaming and cursing.  That's why it's the men in the white coats gotta grab you.  To scratch out your own son's eyes.  Yeah, something like that.  Right.  Not this guy.  Yeah, I'm checking in.  I didn't know that was what you were talking about.  We were, you know, getting the show together and you were mentioning something. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Man, I gotta listen better.  What?  Steven from Bayshore.  Okay.  Hope, I love that you guys don't even pay attention to each other off the air, priceless.  Yeah, we just kind of babble.  Hope someone's listening.  Don't expect much.  Is this a legless cat?  Yeah.  No, no, it's a cat with...  I'm just looking at the news.  I believe the cat's rear end is paralyzed and they put him in what looks like the bottom  end of a shopping cart.  Strap them in and he walks around on his front legs. 
[01:14:30]  Look.  Cats are too uppity to do that to them.  Dogs can pull it off.  Yeah, you can put the little wheelbarrow.  They're always happy and...  But cats are just miserable creatures.  You don't want to do that.  They don't like anything on them.  No.  Strap to wheels.  Please give me a little blue fluid injection.  All right.  Anyway.  So that's an update on the old lady story.  And now we go to the dog head story.  Oh, this one's cute.  We're talking about this one today.  This story's cute.  Listen to this. 
[01:15:00]  Or maybe not.  There was one thing we needed this morning.  I have brought you gentlemen.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  That's a...  That is in it.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Save that.  Yeah, no, that's gonna...  That's how we're ending this break.  Yeah.  With one more piece of Janet and Nick audio from Buffalo.  Sorry about that.  Here is the dog head story.  17-year-old Crystal Brown plastered signs around her neighborhood hoping someone would return  her dog.  And in fact, someone left the package on the family's doorsteps a few days later like a 
[01:15:30]  Christmas present.  Okay.  Inside, the dog's severed head.  And police weren't sympathetic.  And to sit and laugh and the dog's head is right in front of you at your feet?  Give me a break here.  Cops are now saying they are taking the matter seriously.  The Browns have an idea who killed their pets.  Oh, they have an idea?  Or don't have an idea, what did they say?  You go there with a dog's body, do you get half the reward?  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  I read the story yesterday and it was wrapped up like a gift and there were batteries taped  to the top and there was a little note that said something like, congratulations, Krista,  batteries included.  Right.  And she opened up the box.  It was her dog and she, you know, opened up the box.  It was to her and lifted the lid off and there was her dog's head.  The dog that she just loved. 
[01:16:30]  Jesus.  So she just freaks out and runs to her grandmother and starts yelling like, my dog's head.  And also in the box, Valentine's Day candy.  Yeah, Valentine's Day candy.  That is somebody who really needs to be locked up because the person doesn't just stop there.  I saw a picture of her in the paper too and it looks like the type of girl some guy might stalk.  Oh, really?  She's hot?  Yeah, she was kind of cute, 17, and she was playing with her new puppy, I guess. 
[01:17:00]  They had gotten her a new puppy and she was still crying over her dog.  Wait, they already got her a new puppy?  Yeah, she was playing with a puppy.  That's what my family used to do.  You got to get a new puppy.  My family was twisted, man.  We had like family pets and, you know, we lived on a busy road there in Centiport and, you  know, every once in a while, our family dog that we've had forever would wander off into  traffic and just meet a horrific end. 
[01:17:30]  And we're all little kids.  We don't, you know, nothing is more horrific than losing your family pet in some awful way.  And my parents, they meant well, but, you know, the next morning there'd be a little puppy  in the house.  Like, oh my God.  Just replace him.  I know.  Just replace it.  You ever think they would do that with one of you kids?  Right, right.  You had so many brothers and stuff.  Yeah.  It's like, eh, probably one of the kids died.  They would just like get another one.  Their philosophy was just replace the horrific moment with something brand new and, and, and 
[01:18:00]  cuddly.  And cuddly.  Cute.  Right.  You know, you wake up in the morning as a little kid, oh, and you see your dog just frozen in,  in, in a part of the house.  And you're just horrified.  And the next, next day it's, there's a little, little, a little one.  Business as usual.  Dog food dishes still out.  No morning process.  I think my dad looked at pets like he looked at, like, I don't know, a toy.  A toy.  Yeah.  You get a new one.  The toy's broken.  Get a new toy.  Like, I don't think he really understood the concept that maybe the, you could actually 
[01:18:30]  have real feelings for a pet.  I think that's a good thing though.  I see it as like kind of a distraction almost and, and, and kind of a continuation.  Like if your pet dies, you're going to sit there and be all depressed and stuff.  But if you have a new pet that now you have to kind of take care of and, and you got to  scratch it under the chin, like Jimmy goes, give it a little scratch under the chin.  You're going to kind of, I think, get over the other animal faster.  But not the next day.  Like maybe a couple of weeks go by. 
[01:19:00]  A couple of weeks.  Yeah.  How does that dog feel?  He's like the rebound dog.  Yeah.  You know, you're not going to love that dog.  You're not as good as the other, my other doggy.  And then you finally fall for the dog.  You get attached to it and that one gets hit by a car.  Where does it stop?  Yeah.  Well, you stop letting your dog out of the house.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana.  Cody, what's up?  Yeah.  When they found a box in the doorstep, the dad was in the living room screaming, what's  in the box?  What's in the box?  One of the sickest scenes ever.  Thank you, sir.  The, uh, I, I, I, I, I told this story, but, uh, not, not on this side of, uh, little, 
[01:19:30]  little smoky, our cat, little smoky.  When I lived in central Islip, you got a cat and he was gray and we called him smoky.  And, uh, one day, um, after like a year or so of having smoky, smoky, it didn't come  back to the apartment that we lived in.  And, uh, we were all very sad and we used to go out every day and go smoky, smoky, and  try to find him.  And, um, and about a week later I was walking down the road and, um, I saw some fur and 
[01:20:00]  it was, it, but it was flat, like it was completely flat and it was the same color as smoky's fur  and a cat skull, like covered with some hair and maggots all over this thing.  And it was smoky.  It was little smoky had gotten hit by a car and was just pancaked on the side of the  road.  And my father was trying to tell me that smoky ran away, but don't worry, smoky's fine. 
[01:20:30]  And, you know, he's just living with other people, but he's happy and, and, and smoky  was getting eaten by maggots and flat as a pancake with his fur blowing away with the slightest  breeze.  It was just traumatic as a child.  Nothing more horrific as a kid.  No, it's finding your dead pet.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  I thought it would live forever.  Yeah, a little smoky.  Every time. 
[01:21:00]  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Ah.  All right.  Anyway, so there's the, uh, dead dog head story.  Yeah, poor girl.  We'll be following that one in the coming days.  You're going to have to kill that guy that did this.  Cause that guy, they'll catch him.  He'll go to jail for five years.  Yeah.  That'll be nothing.  Not five years.  He's going to, he's going to get like, that leads to a serial killer.  He's coming out after that and he's still going after that girl.  Oh yeah.  He's not going to stop until.  They got to know who the guy is. 
[01:21:30]  It's got to be pretty obvious.  They'll still have someone arrested by the end of the day.  She probably had had previous encounters with this guy.  This doesn't sound like a first step, you know?  Hey, I got an idea.  I really like this girl.  You know, maybe the first step is really trying to get her to like you.  And then when she doesn't, then you cut off her dog's head and send it with Valentine's  day candy.  A lot of times on Valentine's day, I've gone to the last minute to try to get flowers and  they're sold out.  So you're right.  The next best thing.  Next best thing.  Her dog's head. 
[01:22:00]  Her dog's head.  All right.  Well, we got a twofer.  Here's the, uh, the second horrific story of the morning.  Grandmother of five is now facing sex abuse charges for making her own grandchildren to  perform sex acts on her.  Oh.  Oh my God.  Could be the most horrific story.  Oh my God.  That's worse than dog head.  All right.  Let's bring everyone into this story.  Holy geez.  What did you just imagine?  Uh, well, I'm going to help everyone out.  Yeah, go ahead.  Picture your grandma naked. 
[01:22:30]  Worse than just naked.  Naked could be an oopsie when you come in.  I just began.  Okay.  What are you, nuts?  Let's play the story again.  But before you hear the rest of this story, picture your own grandma naked.  Oh, make it stop.  Naked.  Oh.  Naked grandma.  Oh.  Maybe in some hot lingerie.  Oh.  Oh, I don't want to look at this.  Picture your own grandma.  Get it out.  On all fours. 
[01:23:00]  Get it out of my head.  Oh God, I just did.  Oh, is that horrid?  Picture your own grandma getting turned on.  Stop it.  This is awful.  Come on, man.  Help me out.  No.  Okay.  Picture.  No, you have to do it like this.  You really got to.  Picture your grandma.  No, no.  Picture. 
[01:23:30]  Picture.  There you go.  Picture your grandma laying in her bed.  Giving you that, those bedroom eyes and taking her pointer finger and curling it towards  herself going, come here, you.  Rich, do you want in or what?  Picture your own grandma naked, naked and wanting her teeth on the mantle. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Picture your own grandma naked taking her teeth out.  Yeah.  Picture your grandma naked saying, do it the way grandma showed you.  Picture your grandma saying, more spit.  Oh, geez.  Picture your grandma, naked, watching German pornography. 
[01:24:30]  Picture your grandma naked on all fours with you doing something where you can't even see  her face.  And for the lucky people out there that have two grandmas left.  Ah.  Picture both of your grandmas naked at the same time in the same room doing horrific things 
[01:25:00]  to each other.  Oh.  That's horrid.  You know, you want to bring the audience into what you're talking about.  How old were the grandkids?  They couldn't have been that old or else you'd just say, hey, grandma, knock it off.  Speaking of picturing your grandma naked, stop, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock just popped a picture up on the computer screen.  That woman has got to be.  There's for all the guys that like the big boobies. 
[01:25:30]  There you go.  Those look like summer squash.  Oh, my God.  She makes the people on the trains to Auschwitz look healthy.  Yeah, it does look like a concentration camp victim.  What happens?  That gravity is really something.  It's a bitch.  Was that Bill Burr yesterday saying that?  Yeah, yeah.  Like people can go to the gym, but, you know, you don't go every day. 
[01:26:00]  Because that gravity, that gravity is working out every day.  It doesn't take a day off.  It doesn't take a day off.  And that, wow.  What, she been on Jupiter, though?  There's grandma naked.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Oh, is that horrible.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Could you help your grandma out?  No.  Wow.  So what was this broad doing?  Hold on.  Mike in New York.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, dude.  You guys are killing me, man.  Picture your own grandma naked before we play this story. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I listen to you guys all the time.  Love your show, man.  But you guys are sick.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mike.  Let's say hi to Nicole.  Nicole.  Hi.  Hi.  I think you guys made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm so nauseous right now.  I don't know even what I'm going to do when I get to work.  We're great at hypnotizing our audience.  Like, this is what I want to happen.  This show is going to end in about an hour, and you're going to go about your regular day. 
[01:27:00]  But somewhere this weekend, I want you to hear this voice.  Picture your own grandma naked.  Oh, my God.  I'm never going to be able to look at my grandmothers as a shame again.  It's St. Paddy's Day weekend also, so a lot of Irish people are going to be visiting their family and perhaps seeing grandma.  Right.  Picture your own grandma naked, drunk, and wanty.  What?  She's very needy. 
[01:27:30]  It's been at least two decades, and you're the lucky one she's thinking about.  All right.  Well, I mean, we stopped the story there because it does get horrific.  Yeah.  It really does.  This is disgusting.  But now that everyone's on board, here we go.  The grandmother of five is now facing sex abuse charges for making her own grandchildren perform sex acts on her in front of a webcam.  The 49-year-old Colorado woman reportedly told investigators she had two of her granddaughters touch her as a dude watched. 
[01:28:00]  Instant messages were traced from a guy's computer who is also facing child porn charges in Canada.  Police say all the children were under the age of 15, and they were found inside a home with moldy food and feces in almost every room.  Jesus.  You know what?  Just kill all of them.  But here's the thing.  Who cares about the moldy food?  Moldy food?  Oh, my God.  That's an outrage. 
[01:28:30]  Yes.  The grandmother made the kids touch her, and there was paint peeling on the ceiling.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It was moldy.  Close the story out with, you know, come on.  The apartment was found without cable television.  Are you kidding?  My God, man.  Those poor children.  Let's go to Chris in Houston.  Chris, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  All right.  A couple years ago, during Christmas, I saw the grandmother naked. 
[01:29:00]  He walked in on her in the bathroom, tried to go use the shower.  Didn't know she was in there.  Now, picture a sock full of quarters being slung.  That's kind of what happened.  She turned, and things followed.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's something you never want to see.  You don't want to turn your body and then have to wait for your boobs to catch up to your body.  Wait.  You were going to hop into the shower, and she was in there already? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, she was getting dressed, and I needed to go use the shower, and I didn't know she was in there.  Somebody else was using the other shower, and just kind of barged in there, and voila.  I saw horrible things at an old-age home I was doing a job at once.  Yeah.  Yeah, just because they don't care.  You know, you're trying to do work, and like an old lady will just come out of a room with her robe half off,  like hanging off her shoulder and just shuffling down the hallway, and it's just like, 
[01:30:00]  no, no, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Johnson, get back in your room, one of the nurses,  and she's just like, my kids are here.  No, they're not.  They haven't been here in years.  And I got a look.  I was on my ladder and got a look, and her boobs were just all one color.  Like, the human body loses any difference in pigment, except for like liver spots.  Right, right.  But like, you know.  I understand.  It's supposed to be a darker portion, and then lighter. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I got you.  It was all one, like, powdery color.  You got to see the whole thing on?  Powdery color.  Yeah, the whole thing.  Nice.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't nice.  What?  Is this on?  What?  Nice.  Hey, by the way, Evan from Cincinnati, did they say the grandma was 49?  Can I play Guess the Race?  No, you can't, sir.  No, you can't.  Debbie on Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, hey, how you doing?  I love you guys. 
[01:31:00]  Listen to you every morning.  Hey, Debbie.  That image was so horrible that the only thing I could do to get my grandmother out of my mind  was to think of a pink elephant.  The power of suggestion is terrific.  I love it.  Yeah, it was great, but then I was imagining myself in a room with a pink elephant, and  he kept turning back and staring at me like I felt guilty or something.  Picture your grandma naked with peanut butter as she calls the family dog.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, God, I'm so happy I don't have a dog.  Oh.  You got one last one in or what?  Five grandkids.  Can you imagine being the fifth one?  One, you got to be with your grandma, but now you got to follow your four brothers and  sisters.  Yeah.  You're like, jeez, I'm the ugliest one.  All right, there you go.  Oh, Rich from Bohemia out there on Long Island.  Rich, what's up?  Yeah, when you guys do that voice, that picture of your grandma naked, it sounds like a David 
[01:32:00]  Caruso intro.  Yeah, right?  We got to find the music.  Maybe we can do it for those.  Well, if you want to join us, you got to do the bit the right way.  You call us and you got to like, you know, just store a little bit picture your grandma  naked.  That will be in your head all weekend long and you'll be cursing the Opie and Anthony  show smell of mothballs and hairspray.  Oh, you got it.  You got to perform.  And you're just looking over at an old 1940s picture of her and her husband, your grandfather 
[01:32:30]  on the, on the night table.  Those are kind of creepy to look at.  Like the old pictures of your grandma when she was like young at parties at the Coney Island  or something.  And then there she is just like E.T. body.  Remember, remember, grandma has needs too.  You're there to take care of them.  All right.  Listen, here's the update on speaking of grandma's, the 101 year old that we were talking 
[01:33:00]  about that got punched by the mugger there.  Here's the update that we kind of hinted at a little while ago.  Cops are closing in on the thug who violently robbed two elderly women.  Police have not been able to question the man who they believe is in this surveillance  video.  You can see him punching a 101 year old granny during the robbery in Queens.  The man voluntarily checked himself into a mental hospital and cops won't identify the  suspect, but they do say he has a criminal record.  Oh, they got him. 
[01:33:30]  Of course.  They so got him.  Oh, that's going to be great.  I can't wait for that update.  All right.  We'll, we'll step aside.  I think Louis C.K. is coming in.  Nice.  Didn't he write the...  No?  What?  No?  What happened?  Get a travel.  Get a travel?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Damn it.  Well, we should plug the movie anyway.  He wrote the Chris Rock movie or helped it, right?  Yeah.  I think I love my wife.  Yeah.  That starts tomorrow or today?  Today.  Today is Friday.  Oh, Friday night.  My brother...  Maybe we could get into this after the break.  Speaking of movies, so the Chris Rock movie starts today and Louis C.K. was one of the 
[01:34:00]  writers on that.  But my brother saw 300 and he called me up and was like, it was a good movie, but it  was kind of, kind of gay.  A little gay?  I haven't seen it.  A little of the gay?  Was it a bit gay?  Because men are undressed?  Oh, wow.  Men are naked?  Well, because men are undressed.  Well, that would be one of the things.  Well, Oz was, you know, Oz showed its share of naked men.  And a lot of people watch that.  Rome.  Rome has a scene in it that is just horrific. 
[01:34:30]  It's not horrific.  Stop it.  Jesus.  I thought there was an elephant on the camera.  It was so big, they decorated it.  Yeah, they decorated it.  They really did.  They did.  There were things on it.  Guy could have picked up peanuts and fed himself.  How the hell did you find a website called Granny Island?  You sick ass.  Granny Island.  E-Rock.  It's all just grannies.  I'm loving the E-Rock because he just, like, surfs.  When we get into something, he surfs and finds the most horrific things associated with 
[01:35:00]  it.  Well, he caught an ugly wave.  He, uh, he found a site called, uh, Granny Island.  And I gotta tell you, Rachel, age 55, not too bad as far as a granny goes.  Is that the one that's, uh, on the left side?  On the left?  Not too bad.  Oh, then there's some, oh, my, oh, oh, oh, oh, wow.  Wow, Grandma's hungry.  Holy crap.  Is that a, uh, gilf?  A what?  Is she a gilf?  A granny I'd like to, is that it? 
[01:35:30]  Is that what they call them?  I'm sure there's a gilf website.  Gilf.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Wow, Grandma.  You know, that picture.  Save some for somebody else, will ya?  That picture is so altered and photoshopped.  Which one?  Well, the one on the left there, or, yeah.  That one?  Yeah.  There's no way she looks like that in real life.  It's Brenda.  She's age 68.  Well, maybe the photoshop makes her look like she's 58.  I mean, give me a break. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, you know what that looks.  She's got, like, she's got.  Granny Island.  She's got the copper tone tan butt.  Stop it.  No way she's, like, got a little even tan like that.  There's no way a seven-year-old has a better body than my wife.  Jeez, Rich.  Rich, you're going to have your kid.  She's not scaring your baby.  What's wrong with you?  That's a good point.  All right.  We got to regroup, and we'll continue.  Granny Island. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  Hot nude.  Wait.  Gremlins absolutely favorite mature porn sites.  Hot nude granny.  Granny's place.  Granny Island is just hilarious.  Granny Fantasy, yeah.  My God, lovey.  It just goes on and on.  Bravo to E-Rock, finding Granny Island.  All right.  He had it in his favorites.  Who's kidding who?  Huh?  He had it in his favorites, a sick bastard.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe we'll get into the 300 discussion.  I forgot what my brother said, but it was hilarious. 
[01:37:00]  He said something during the movie because he was just, like, a little uncomfortable at  the male nudity and said something, and the whole theater started cracking up because  they all were thinking the same thing, and I forgot what he told me.  I was a little tired when he called me yesterday.  Maybe he'll call today.  And let's not forget, we don't have to promote it, but it is happening.  FH Riley's tomorrow.  We're doing a little St. Paddy's Day karaoke thing at my brother's restaurant, 400 New York  Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  You're going, right, Ant?  Absolutely.  You'll definitely be there?  All right. 
[01:37:30]  It's going to be a nice party in Huntington tomorrow night, so hopefully we'll see just  a few of you there.  It's a small place.  It's a small place.  Good luck.  This place is going to be packed now.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:38:00]  Ah, good morning.  Hey, let's not forget the tickets go on sale for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  First date is Las Vegas, Nevada at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino at The Joint.  The place is called The Joint in Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  April 14th.  I was reading some message boards last night, I have to admit it, and a lot of people flying  from all over the country for this first date.  Yep.  Only 1,500 tickets.  They did a pre-sale yesterday and like 500 tickets went already. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  And now the tickets go on sale for everybody else starting at 6 a.m., I believe.  Vegas time?  Really?  I don't know.  The time thing is screwing me up, but I think so.  I think it is.  Oh, yeah, because it would be 9 a.m. Eastern time.  Yes.  These are going to fly.  Absolutely.  So, really, you've got to get on this quick.  I don't have the lineup in front of me.  Unfortunately, all the details are on opiananthety.com.  Boston's going to be there.  Norton's going to be there. 
[01:39:00]  Louis C.K. is going to be there.  Bobby.  Bob Kelly.  Ralphie May.  We're getting a lot of people because there's about eight or nine comedians.  Frank, is he on it?  Well, Frank Caliendo will be on this one.  And then when we're out there, we're going to have a press conference.  That's enough to get them hooked.  Don't worry, boss.  I'll do the heavy lifting.  And then when we're out there, we'll do a press conference and we'll announce the rest  of the tour dates.  We're doing nine or ten dates this year.  How cool is that?  And then next year, forget it.  We have to give up the radio show just to tour all year long with this thing. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  We're going to have to.  Next year goes to 20 dates, I think.  I don't know how we pull that off, but the interest is really, really, really high on  this comedy tour.  We're going to just have to get a tour bus and go around the country.  Yeah.  Well, the stories got out there.  Like the Home Sweet Home video.  The stories are all out there from last year's tour.  Yeah.  Home Sweet Home.  Yeah, right.  Well, we would kill each other if we were living on a bus together.  No, please.  This group, forget about it. 
[01:40:00]  By the way, I guess we came to the conclusion that 300 is not gay.  I haven't seen the movie.  My brother was a little disturbed.  Your brother gave a little review.  I once seen where you get to see, you know, a muscle butt or something.  Muscle-bound buttocks.  Well, Thans saw the movie, so perhaps he could give us a little insight.  Tom had to come running in here going, it's not gay, it's not gay.  So, all right, it's not gay then.  Yeah, I saw it in Glorious IMAX.  So that ass was a skyscraper of mine. 
[01:40:30]  Right there in your face.  Yeah.  Now, there's one scene where the lead guy is just standing on a balcony at night.  And you could, it's a full body shot from behind.  Oh, from behind?  Yes.  Yeah.  But then, you know, he goes and has sex with his wife, and she's naked.  Oh, so then there's a sex scene.  Yeah.  Full nudity.  And then there's a scene with an oracle-type figure, and the only way she can tell the future  is by writhing around naked.  Hey.  All right.  You get some female nudity, too. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  More than male nudity.  Oh, God.  So the only male nudity you're getting, really, is the guy's butt from the back as he stands  on his balcony.  Yes.  Okay.  And then what about the rest of, like, you probably get a lot of, like, muscle guy.  A lot of shirtless men.  Like shirtless men type thing.  Decapitating each other.  How do we, you know?  Oh, decapitating each other.  Well, that's it.  Romantic.  All right.  Well, that's a must-see.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  We got Stryker in Colorado.  What's up, Stryker?  Hey, morning, boys.  Good morning. 
[01:41:30]  Do you guys realize that that story of that grandmother out here in Colorado, that is,  like, the fourth time in, like, the last two years we have had similar stories.  Colorado is now becoming the home of killers and weirdos.  Yeah, Colorado is really getting weird over the years.  Hey, one other thing on the virus in Vegas.  Yeah.  The Hard Rock Hotel is booked solid.  I tried to get reservations for the hotel.  And the girl told me, she said, we are booked solid for that weekend now. 
[01:42:00]  Well, I was reading that there's another hotel across the street that people are booking into.  A lot of the pests are going to, is it called Terribles or something like that?  Terribles?  I'm just trying to help people out.  I hope you got that right.  Well, because, you know, we're trying to help the listeners out because the ticket's a little  expensive because it's only 1,500 seats.  Yeah.  You know, the ticket prices for the other tour dates will be a lot less because, you know,  there are much bigger rooms.  Yeah.  Got to cover expenses and stuff.  So that's why that's going on. 
[01:42:30]  But supposedly a lot of the pests are booking rooms at a place called Terrible or Terribles,  and it's right across the street from Hard Rock.  It's right there.  And the rooms are much cheaper there.  Yeah, the Excalibur and the MGM are all like two blocks away, so those are options also.  All right.  Very cool.  All right.  Punch it up, boys.  We're going to have a great time out there.  I can't wait to see a lot of the fans from out west.  It's going to be very, very cool.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tom in Boston.  Tom, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  One time I had to talk about the grandmother thing. 
[01:43:00]  I had to go see my grandmother because somebody called her and said she didn't sound so good.  So I go over there.  It turns out she had a stroke.  So I call the ambulance.  They show up.  You know, they got to get her in the gurney, take her in the ambulance.  On the way to the hospital, shirt pops open.  She's just sitting there with the face paralyzed, and she's got the boobies just flapping away  for everybody to see, especially me, right up there in the back of the ambulance with  it.  And then, Anthony, let me tell you, it was one color, just like you said.  Oh, wow.  It just become one color. 
[01:43:30]  Grossest thing I've ever seen, I think.  I'm not laughing at your grandma, by the way, Tom.  Oh, no.  She turned out to be all right, so it's okay.  I mean, I'm laughing now at it, but, I mean, that was pretty sick, you know?  I'm laughing at another website.  All right, E-Rock discovered Granny Island, and now I'm looking at a website called oldfarteffing.com.  That's great.  Oh, just in case the thought is leaving your brain. 
[01:44:00]  Picture your own grandma naked.  Um, no.  Let's say hi to Will in Michigan.  Will.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just got to say, I work third shift, so I listen to you guys before I go to bed.  Yeah.  And now I am afraid that I'm going to be having dreams of my grandma asking me to spread open  her grilled cheese sandwich and take a little bite.  I'm just afraid to go to bed now.  So, thank you guys for scarring me for life.  All right.  Sorry about that, sir. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, now I'm getting reports that Terribles is booked solid.  Uh, Theron, something like that from Nevada.  What's up?  What do you got?  Yeah.  Uh, when you announced Wednesday about, uh, being in Vegas, I checked for the hard rock.  It was booked.  And then I checked to see what was close, and Terribles was close, and it was booked already,  too.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  That's about all I got.  All right.  I guess you're going to have to, like, find out for yourself.  Hey, by the way, uh, our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:45:00]  No one's playing the Picture Your Grandma Naked game.  Why?  Uh, because they don't want to.  Yeah, but you're supposed to call up.  That's disgusting.  Distort your voice and just say, Picture Your Grandma Naked.  And then maybe.  And maybe.  Yeah, there you go.  Hmm.  Doing horrific things.  All right.  Enough with that website there, Yorah.  I just saw a video.  It looked like, uh, I think her name was Molly Shannon on SNL.  Like an older version of her just getting, just getting destroyed. 
[01:45:30]  Let's just put it that way.  Destroyed.  Oh.  Anthony, St. Paddy's Day Parade Saturday here in New York City.  Yes.  Some controversy as usual with the St. Paddy's Day Parade here in New York.  It's, uh, usually the gays, uh, not being allowed to march.  And they, they protest.  And then, uh, the city goes, well, you know, the parade can do whatever they want.  It's their organization, so that's the way it is.  Uh, the gays seem to have given up.  But now, the organizer of the parade, and his name slips my mind at the moment, but, uh, 
[01:46:00]  it's been in the news.  He is, um, putting the fire department, FDNY, at the back of the parade route.  Why?  Now, for years, traditionally, they are right behind the NYPD in the parade.  That's never good, by the way.  And, what?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Those guys hate each other.  A couple of fisticuffs.  Oh, wow.  Well, you know, uh, they could, they could all get together on St. Paddy's Day.  And we love, uh, both groups. 
[01:46:30]  We don't play favorites, but those guys, oh, man.  Yeah, well, it's, it's known they don't really get along, uh, as well as they should, maybe.  Hey, there's some drinking going on.  It's just, it's just, uh, you know.  So, uh, the, the parade organizer, the head muckety-muck there, is saying that, uh, well,  the firemen get too drunk, uh, during this whole thing and doesn't want them at the front of  the parade.  So, he's putting them all the way in the back and it's a complete snub disrespect.  And all I'm thinking is, uh, a short few years ago, uh, five years ago or so, these guys 
[01:47:00]  were the heroes of 9-11.  Uh, remember the St. Paddy's Day parade after 9-11?  I mean, people crying, uh, just standing ovations every day, whatever you could give these guys.  There wasn't enough to give these guys as they were marching down that parade route.  And five short years later, they're now scumbags that have to, uh, pick up the rear of a parade. 
[01:47:30]  You know, it's complete, it's a complete disrespect to the fire department by this, uh, uh, jackass  that runs the, uh, parade.  What is it, his personal vendetta against these guys?  First of all, everyone drinks on, on St. Paddy's Day.  Everyone, uh, has, has a drink out there.  You can see public intoxication and you're not even supposed to be drinking out there.  But somehow it just happens.  And it's just a complete lack of respect and just shows how, how short-sighted people are. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, like I said, five years ago, heroes, five years later, get to the back of the parade  route, uh, you, you're drunk.  Just an embarrassment.  Yeah, not cool.  How do you say somebody owns or runs a parade?  Doesn't the city own it?  They gotta pay taxes on it?  No, they, they get permits.  They get whatever they need.  And it's run by, uh, whatever the organization is.  It's, you know, it's one of the oldest parades in the country.  I mean, these guys have been, the same organization's been running this parade for years and years. 
[01:48:30]  Can we put a stop to the parades, by the way?  I mean, the ones we all know and love, fine.  Well, St. Paddy's is one there.  Yeah, of course.  That should continue.  The Thanksgiving Day Parade should continue and a couple others there.  But, uh, every weekend in New York City, they-  The Moroccan Parade.  The West Indian Day Parade.  Some of those.  The, uh-  Celebrating different cultures here in the city.  I gotta drive.  Yeah.  Get out of my way.  Uh, let's say hi to Stan in Jersey.  Stan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good. 
[01:49:00]  I guess there's a predecessor voice of yours, let's say, boys.  Boys.  Boys.  Um, the, uh, you guys talking about websites.  The predecessor porn industry film that started it all was a movie called Ripples and Wrinkles.  Ripples and Wrinkles?  Bad chicks and old ladies.  And it starred the infamous Rod Jeremy.  Yeah.  Tasting tacos and dipping wick into, you know-  All right, be careful. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you know, with-  We get it.  I mean-  You know what, though?  We have challenged our listeners for many, many, many, many, many, many years.  We have the greatest porn over at the other joint.  Uh, we have the original copy.  It's at least-  It's-  It's 10 years old.  And it's called, uh, Century Sex.  Century Sex.  We have the greatest porno ever.  And, uh, they kind of lied.  You know, the lady in the-  In the video, she's like 85, but they're saying she's 100.  She looks 100.  She looks 100.  I've never seen 100, but- 
[01:50:00]  She has an ET body, and she is just doing the most horrific-  It looks like every organ in her body settled in her lower abdomen.  Yeah, to this young guy who's, uh, maybe in his, uh, early 60s.  Yeah.  Looks extremely young next to her.  Let's just put it that way.  And he, he's just having a tough time.  He can't-  He can't get anything going.  I think this was pre, you know, uh, uh, Viagra and all that.  He couldn't get anything going.  Your bones breaking. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Her eating body.  Oh, my God.  A quart of vegetable oil.  Yeah.  Uh, ripples and wrinkles.  I gotta go- I'm gonna go find that today.  Thanks, boys.  I love you.  Take care.  All right.  Uh, ba-ba-ba.  Uh, let's say hi to Stephanie on Long Island.  She wants to play Picture Your Grandma Naked.  Yes, Stephanie.  Precious?  Precious?  Is that you?  Are you, Precious?  Have a good one, guys.  I think she's, uh, trying to get you, Opie, with that one. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, well, wonderful.  That, uh, that's a story too long to tell right now.  Another day.  Oh, this guy thinks he's off the hook.  Bryce in Montana.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  You think you're off the hook.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  Uh, this is the first time I've ever sat here thinking I was glad both my grandmothers  were dead before I was two years old.  Picture your dead grandma naked. 
[01:51:30]  No.  That's horrible.  Uh, fireman wants to comment.  Let's say hi to Vinny in New York.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up, bro?  Nothing.  I work in Brooklyn at Engine 230.  I'm marching the parade every year.  Uh, and yeah, you know, everybody gets a little banged up, but, uh, all it does, now we don't  step off till 1 p.m.  It just gives us more time to get banged up before we march off.  Yeah, see?  Someone else is saying that.  I guess in more time. 
[01:52:00]  Now we'll be more drunk than we usually are by the time we start marching.  There you go.  All right, thank you.  And we got the NYPD checking in.  Uh, gotta keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, yeah, I'm a New York City, uh, police officer, and I think it's awesome that, uh,  this guy finally had some, uh, cojones to tell the fire department, uh, what they can and  can't do.  We can't even wear, uh, shamrocks or, uh, green, uh, carnations on our, uh, jackets, and these 
[01:52:30]  guys have been getting away with murder for the last few years, so I think it's awesome  that, uh, this guy finally put them in their place.  Why can't you guys wear shamrocks or anything?  Uh, it's been going on for years.  I've been on it for 17 years.  Yeah, but why can't you do that?  Who, who's getting pissed off that you guys are doing that?  Yeah.  Because that's what it comes down to.  Our, our department.  Oh.  The police department won't allow us to wear anything.  But what was the reason given?  It's not part of the uniform.  Uniform.  Oh, okay.  You see the Puerto Rican Day Parade, guys are going nuts, dancing, drinking, beers, you 
[01:53:00]  know, dancing with women, and you get the, uh, the, uh, St. Paddy's Day Parade, and,  you know, everybody's got to stay in line, and you can't go crazy, and, you know, so it's  about time that the, uh, flight department won't have to, uh, you know, do whatever else  has got to do.  I just think it's, it's, uh, uh, so hypocritical and so short-sighted.  Yeah.  Everyone forgets.  Yeah.  Thank you, Steve.  Well, Sean's saying you're wrong, Ed.  Sean on Long Island.  Sean.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hi, Sean.  How are you?  Well, uh, one of the reasons you got, you got the reason wrong why they're not letting 
[01:53:30]  the firemen in the front.  The guy got mad that, um, last year, or it was the last year or the year before, they  had, um, firemen from New Orleans, because, uh, from Katrina and all that, and they unfurled  the New Orleans Fire Department flag, and the guy who runs up the parade got all pissed  off.  All right.  Well, are they going to be here this year?  No, they're not.  Let the FDNY, like, march, uh, up in the front.  I, I agree.  I agree 100%, but, uh, that's the reason.  It wasn't, I don't think it's because they were drinking. 
[01:54:00]  The guy got all bent out of shape, because it was only supposed to be, uh, uh, FDNY marching,  and not, and they invited the New Orleans Fire Department that they worked with during  Katrina.  So, what's the big deal?  More problems from those Katrina people.  Jesus.  Well, you know, that's the way it goes, I guess, but, uh, this guy's a jerk off.  What can you say?  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  What is the parade?  Tomorrow?  Ah, yeah.  Leave the city tomorrow.  Just evacuate.  I'm going to Philly.  I, I'm, I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm tapping out.  Uh, Bobby Bigrager, let's go. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey, Bobby.  Picture your naked grandma.  No, picture.  Picture your naked grandma working out, doing toe touches with her hands on her hips.  Punch it out.  Okay, that's really, that is a bad image, man.  All right.  People have decided to play, finally, an hour later.  Swanson from New York.  What's up?  Hey, Swanson.  Picture your grandma naked.  At your knees, her tongue thrusting vigorously. 
[01:55:00]  Jesus.  We like to leave a little to the imagination on this show.  That's not nice.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  It's an awful image, man.  That it really is.  It's disturbing me.  You got one?  Picture your grandmother naked, cuddling you when you're finished.  You never want to cuddle with grandma.  No, I don't.  You smell like powder and cheese. 
[01:55:30]  You smell like a hallway at an old hotel in Kelsey.  Oh, God.  Like missing in Cheetos.  Picture your grandma naked, getting her wrinkles straightened out.  All right, look. 
[01:56:00]  All right, thank you, Iraq.  He just cleansed the palate with a nice website.  Oh.  He's being nice today.  Yeah, Iraq just throwing horrific sights at us.  And then he gives us one to kind of cleanse the palate.  All right, here's a little St. Paddy's Day story.  Great grandmother.  We're getting near St. Patrick's Day, but even the luck of the Irish won't help you if you're breaking the law behind the wheel today.  Look at this.  Orange County deputies are donning a leprechaun costume and a laser gun to catch speeders in the act.  Oh, my.  Some say dressing up is unfair to drivers, but the sheriff's office says the long-range laser gun they are using will allow the on-duty leprechaun, if you will, to clock your vehicle long before you see him. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, come on, guys.  The machine's so good that we'll get you before you see us anyway.  Come on, guys.  Help us out a little bit here.  First of all, in New York, you can't wear a carnation, but if you're a cop in Orlando, they'll make you dress as a leprechaun.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I play that. 
[01:57:00]  We like the hypocrisy of the whole thing.  Look at the little leprechaun pulling me over.  What the hell is...  All right, E.  What?  Amputee sex.  What are you doing?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  The boss is getting sick.  Way to go right back to the beginning of the show.  Wow.  There's something you don't see every day.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen anything like this in my life.  You know, the Internet is just amazing.  Oh, my God.  Invented many years ago so universities could exchange ideas with each other. 
[01:57:30]  Science.  That's a leg, right?  And we end up with a leg stump being used.  Well, I think everyone can understand.  Man, it's just terrific when you get rid of that stupid calf muscle, when you can do it  with that stump.  It seems like the foot and the ankle that really stops people from doing that.  Right.  Because that woman is missing a foot and an ankle, and now she has a completely new use 
[01:58:00]  for that calf.  Oh, wow.  They're lesbians, too.  All right.  Yeah.  Isn't that wonderful?  All right.  Lesbian leg love.  Hey, thank you, Iraq.  That's just terrific.  How do you follow that?  Iraq's a little too good at finding this stuff.  Like, you're not just like, hey, I'm just doing my job.  This one was courtesy of Danny.  Oh, really?  Our own Danny?  This one was not my Danny.  That's no surprise whatsoever.  By the way, Danny has a great new contest.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:58:30]  I think we've got to pretty much keep it off the radio, but I think it's going to be all  over the Internet.  How do we explain Danny's contest?  I don't think you can.  Really?  Yeah.  Let me think.  It's like decorating something.  Like Easter egg decoration.  That's the best thing you can do?  Yeah, I'm really trying hard to do this.  Let's say you had a fudge brownie, right?  All right. 
[01:59:00]  There you go.  That's it.  That's all you have to say.  And you mold it into a shape.  Not necessarily.  Maybe.  Well, you could take it and squish it in your hands.  Danny just wants people to show.  And roll it a little.  Danny just wants people to just show off their brownie.  Yeah, yeah.  To begin with.  And then, I don't know.  Then maybe you just happen to have a Mr. Potato head around and you might want to use  some of the parts.  And you could decorate it up and put a nose on it and eyes.  And just decorate up your little brownie that maybe you've squished in your hand and rolled 
[01:59:30]  a little bit on a tabletop so it looks nice.  But it's coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  That one will be one of those internet things.  Congrats, Danny.  Yeah.  Great concept.  Only you sponsored, too, by the way.  And we just gave this guy a raise for this stuff.  What's wrong with us?  All right.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Ohio.  Chuck, what's going on?  Picture your grandmother naked crawling out of a truck in a truck stop. 
[02:00:00]  That whore.  Let's go to Doug in Virginia Beach.  Doug.  Picture your grandma naked sitting on the bed, Indian style, clipping her toenail.  Oh, big yellow ones flying.  All right.  A few more of those.  And we'll mop up a little bit.  We have our last look at the Janet and Nick show from Buffalo.  That I got it here.  Love it.  And I don't know if we could get into this, but we were mentioning in an article, there's 
[02:00:30]  a show out of Washington that does a show that's opposite from what we do.  Obviously, it's, I guess, Christian based.  Yeah, but they're like kind of a shock jock show.  Shock jock, Christian based, morning zoo, keep everything nice type of radio show.  Love God thing.  Thing.  Ish.  It's out of Jersey.  So we might take a look at them as well after the break.  We'll see.  We'll figure it out.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:01:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll try to go into a speed round here.  Before we move on to XM Satellite Radio, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Freddie in Kingston.  Freddie, what's going on today?  I picture your grandmother naked giving your father a happy ending.  Dave in Connecticut, what's going on? 
[02:01:30]  Hey.  Picture your grandmother naked putting on lotion.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  And it does this whenever it's told.  Christian in New York, what's up?  Picture your grandma naked.  A la Jimmy.  That's a tranny.  Almost what?  Danny in Whitestone.  Danny.  Picture your grandma with Alzheimer's.  Two different socks on.  Coming out of the bathroom, not fully cleaned. 
[02:02:00]  You got to have the wanting in there somewhere, though.  It's all about the wanting.  These are just disgusting scenarios.  These guys are late to the party.  It's all about your grandma naked wanting.  You guys aren't making it sexy.  Yeah, shame on you for not making it sexy.  Yeah, make it hot.  David on Long Island, what's up?  Picture your grandmother naked playing Twister blindfolded. 
[02:02:30]  All right.  That would be fun.  Picture your grandma naked at a key party.  Janet and Nick, we say goodbye to Janet and Nick after today.  Yep.  We've been focusing on this god-awful radio show in Buffalo this week.  Next week, maybe we go Pittsburgh.  Maybe we go Pittsburgh next week.  This is one of these awful shows.  It has the guy and the girl.  Yeah.  And the hole.  She just sits there.  Oh, gosh. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, no.  Adds nothing.  Hey, how are you doing there, Sam?  Oh, quick question.  Just got a PSP and Luminous,  and I was wondering your high score in challenge mode.  Oh.  About 260,000.  Top that.  Top that.  Game took well over an hour and a half.  Good luck.  I'm sure someone's going to laugh at that score,  but I'm pretty proud of 260.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So we got Sam.  He's been working this bid all the way for us. 
[02:03:30]  Old candy head.  It's just Sam.  It's just Sam.  So we got some audio of them.  Today, as we're doing Picture Your Grandma Naked,  they're talking about, I think, birthday cake.  Birthday cake?  And I think they brought in a birthday cake.  Yeah.  Was it someone's birthday?  Whose birthday?  I don't think it's anybody's birthday.  They just brought it in because they wanted cake.  What?  What?  They wanted a cake.  It seemed like it had come up on an earlier show,  and they were doing a callback to wanting some cake. 
[02:04:00]  This just sounds horrible.  They got a cake.  And then talked about the cake?  They talked about it as they were tasting it.  Well, they had to find forks.  And then they talked about the goodness of the cake?  Of the cake that they got.  All right.  This was on the radio?  On the radio, yes.  Oh, this isn't Al Roker?  It was their first break of the day.  First break?  That's how they started the show, Cake Talk.  Cake Talk?  Yeah.  Probably a segment called Cake Talk on their show. 
[02:04:30]  The middle of a radio show is the shaky ground.  You know, when you crack the mic's first thing,  oh, you know what you want to talk about.  Yeah.  Someone that did you wrong, the top story of the day.  Yeah.  Some maybe picture your grandma naked type of bit.  But if you have to start your show by talking about cake  and its goodness, you're in deep trouble as far as a radio show goes.  All right.  Well, here it is.  Janet and Nick out of Buffalo, New York.  There was one thing we needed this morning.  I have brought you, gentlemen, cake. 
[02:05:00]  Is that birthday cake?  This is birthday cake.  I don't eat birthday cake.  Look at this cake.  Holy stacked cake.  I have learned something about myself.  I am a German bakery girl.  Like, because Walter's is a German bakery.  Oh, it's Walter's.  And that's the kind of sweets and pastries that I like.  This was the most beautiful cake.  Nick, I'm so excited for you to taste it.  You got to pull a piece out and taste it.  New guy, you do cake, right?  Pull a piece out with my hands? 
[02:05:30]  I am forced right here.  I got to be coming.  It's just because it's icing everywhere.  I'll go for it.  Of course it is.  Hit me.  Hold on.  Doesn't that cake look good, though?  I think I'm going to try that.  You got to try it.  I'm telling you, it is careful.  It might.  You don't want it?  Yeah.  You got to just be careful.  Yeah, I'm being careful.  Yeah.  Nick's like, yeah, whatever, Janet.  Be careful guys are with cake.  See, now you want to lick your fingers when the frosting gets on, but you can't because you're  serving.  Isn't that tough to do?  Kept going through that last night.  I'm not a waiter.  Uh-huh.  Good thing you're not a waiter.  Yep.  All right.  You got to taste that.  Tell me if that's not the best cake ever. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, no.  How good is that cake?  Taste it.  Isn't it delicious?  This is going.  How good?  It's a good birthday cake.  I told you it's a good birthday cake.  Isn't that great?  All right.  We're laughing for a dumb reason, obviously.  Yeah.  I can just see what Sam has done to this already.  We like to play this stuff just to show people, because there's a lot of new people kind  of figuring if they like us or not.  Great birthday cake.  So we want them to fully understand us.  It's great birthday cake.  In our world, that ends with a cake in someone's face, or you crush their dreams by just punching 
[02:06:30]  the cake as hard as you can.  Yeah.  Right in the middle.  Just go.  Smash it in her face.  Right before they were going to taste the cake.  But they actually tasted the cake.  That was the payoff, actually having a piece of cake.  Oh, this is great cake.  Well, here you say, can I have some cake and eat grandma, too?  Oh, gee.  Moving on.  Why?  Was that dumb, do you think?  No.  Who knows? 
[02:07:00]  Where is this radio station now?  Where is this?  Yeah.  Where is this radio station?  Buffalo.  Are you talking just to be heard at this point?  I'm sorry.  I had one or two bad lines the whole day.  You can't always focus on a negative.  And even Patrice told me something.  I love the people that feel like, you know what, I haven't talked in a while on the show.  I better just say something.  I only said it in Buffalo like two or three times to set this thing up.  And I know we have a bad, we're really not good listeners on this show, but my God, why 
[02:07:30]  would that matter at that point?  Because I was wondering if I did the station, if I did these two people.  Because I would say, yeah, it's Buffalo.  And you go, oh, yeah, of course.  That's what you expect out of Buffalo?  No, this is happening.  Every city in America has a show like this.  Everywhere has got these.  So in the end, it doesn't really matter where this is coming from, but it's extra exciting  for the people in Buffalo because they're like, oh, I think I've seen a billboard of  these dopes or something.  So they're a little closer to the bit than the rest of the country, but everyone can  play along.  All right.  So it was laughing because you know the obvious. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  I think Sam might have hit another home run today.  Sam?  I try.  You're feeling good.  Yeah.  All I hit is home runs.  He's so modest.  So the bit, Rich, because you haven't been around, we take that audio and now we make  it funnier and we bring them into the shock jock world.  See, it's our job to make these awful shows sound interesting and funny.  Got it?  Okay.  All right.  With that said, here's that same break, but definitely funnier. 
[02:08:30]  And I haven't heard it, but I guarantee you hit a home run.  All right.  I guarantee.  There was one thing we needed this morning.  I have brought you gentlemen.  Is that b****?  This is b****.  I don't eat b****.  Look it.  This is b****.  Holy b****.  I have learned something about myself.  I am a German b****.  That's the kind of b**** that I like.  This was the most beautiful b****.  Nick, I'm so excited for you to taste it.  I got to be coming.  It's just because it's b**** everywhere. 
[02:09:00]  I'll go for it.  Of course it is.  Hit me.  Hold on.  Doesn't that b**** look good, though?  I think I'm going to try that.  You got to try it.  I'm telling you, it is careful.  It might.  You don't want to?  Yeah.  You got to just be careful.  Yeah, I'm being careful.  Yeah.  Nick's like, yeah, whatever.  You know how careful guys are with b****.  See, now you want to look b**** when the b**** is on, but you can't because you're b****.  Isn't that tough to do?  Yep.  Kept going through that.  I'm a b****.  Uh-huh.  Good thing you're not a b****.  Yep.  All right.  You got to taste that.  Tell me if that's not the best b**** ever.  How good is that b****?  Taste it.  Isn't it delicious? 
[02:09:30]  How good?  It's a b****.  I told you it's a b****.  Isn't that great?  See, they're a filthy show.  See how filthy they are?  I just have one critique.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Bit over?  Why wouldn't you?  No, no.  Being that the word was cake with the k sound and the k sound at the end, why wouldn't  you leave a little more, just a touch of the beginning or end, so it would really sound 
[02:10:00]  filthy?  Hold on again.  Some of them didn't make total sense when she was kind of good.  And then if I left some of them in, then you didn't know when she was talking about  here and there.  I don't know.  I just assumed because it sounded like another word, which would be really filthy.  That you would leave in a k somewhere.  Yeah.  But that's my only critique.  I was hoping actually to hear some of that.  That's why I was all psyched up to hear it.  You want do-over?  Maybe do-over. 
[02:10:30]  Do-over.  Just leave a little.  Do-over.  Where it's appropriate, where she would be using that word.  Because I know later on, it sounds like they're talking about some other stuff.  Right.  Go for it.  Exactly.  That still made me laugh pretty good today.  Let's play What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show?  Tom in Connecticut.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, what's up, Tom?  Hey.  I learned that the 1,200-pound Mexican guy's nickname was Porquito.  Porquito, right.  Ah. 
[02:11:00]  I forgot what we even talked about for that guy.  Like Tiny.  Let's go to Turbo on Long Island.  Turbo, what's up?  Picture your grandmother naked in a butcher shop.  Why in a butcher shop?  All right.  It's Nick.  It's going to be the end of the bit.  Yeah.  Nick and Philly, what's up?  I learned two things today.  Okay.  When you stick your hand down a garbage disposal, it usually comes out bloody.  And Rich Voss wouldn't make a pimple on Norton's ass.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:11:30]  It's not a nice laugh, is it?  All right.  I'm laughing at you.  Well, we've got to get out of here.  Yeah.  And we've got to remind people to get their tickets for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show,  April 14th in Vegas.  Vegas.  At the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  Tickets go on sale in like five minutes from right now through Ticketmaster.  Expect to see some of you people there out west.  I want to see some of you people at the poker table, too. 
[02:12:00]  And by the pool and all that, we're doing a press conference out there to announce the rest of the tour dates.  Uh, what else can we tell the people?  I don't have the lineup in front of me.  All the info's up on opianthony.com, but it's eight or nine comedians that you know and love from this radio show.  Well, you know.  Huh?  Well, you know.  Comedians that you know.  Some of them you don't love.  Like who?  Me.  Nah, people love you, Rich.  I know.  Rich, where are you going to be?  Uh, next week in Wilkes-Barre, uh, Wisecracker. 
[02:12:30]  Wilkes what?  Wilkes-Barre-O-Bear?  Wilkes-Barre.  Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  All right, wait.  So, you're going to be at, uh, what's the comedy club?  Wisecrackers.  Rich Voss at Wisecrackers where?  Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, 23rd and 24th.  Wilkes-Barre.  Whatever it's called.  All I'm seeing is ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, all over the, um, the pal talk.  What does that mean?  They're laughing at you.  Wilkes-barrel. 
[02:13:00]  I didn't say barrel.  I said Wilkes-Barre.  Yeah, how do you say it?  Wilkes-Barre.  Why don't you tell us?  Wilkes-Barre.  Wilkes-Barre?  I'm a Wilkes-Barre.  Wilkes-Barre.  Last week you were saying Wilkes-Barre-O.  You said Wilkes-Barre-O, Wilkes-Barrel almost came out.  Wilkes-Barre-O.  Where are you playing?  Wisecrackers.  At?  Uh, I don't know, north of the Poconos.  Pennsylvania. 
[02:13:30]  Rich is hilarious.  He really is.  If you're in the area, go see him at Wisecrackers and Wilkes-Barrel.  Wilkes-Barre.  Wilkes-Barre.  Wilkes-Barre.  Something John Wilkes-Barre.  Like what?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha.  All right, let's say hi to Wayne in Maine.  Wayne, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  I learned that amputees need loving, too.  Yeah, we learned that from EROC.  Thank you for that website, EROC.  I'll be sharing that with my family and friends later today. 
[02:14:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, we really got to get out of here.  The phone's a lip, but I don't know what they want to talk about, unfortunately, so, which  is fine.  We took a lot of phone calls today.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Maybe we'll see a few of you guys tomorrow at Bro's Restaurant there in Huntington Village,  FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue.  It's going to be a mob scene, obviously.  Oh, absolutely.  Just about everyone from the radio show will be there just kind of celebrating St. Paddy's  Day and doing the karaoke thing.  Right.  All right, guys.  Rich, thank you so much.  Thank you.  We'll see you guys over at XM. 
[02:14:30]  If not, have a great weekend.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Oh, my God.  Whose stupid idea was this?  Fuck this.  Fuck this.  We got tricked.  We started feeling that spring weather, the sun, the temperature was rising. 
[02:15:00]  So, we're like, you know, it's time to bring the walkover back.  Remember the walkover?  Yeah.  Yeah, we would do that, and we would take the mics with us and go outside, and yesterday  it was about 70 degrees at one point, and today it's fucking freezing.  It's 30 degrees.  It's a 40 degree difference, but I want to say hi to everyone that made it.  Yeah.  People showed up.  These guys are as crazy as we are. 
[02:15:30]  People showed up.  Oh, by the way, the walkover, we're retiring it after today for another two weeks.  Yeah, fuck that.  Fuck this shit.  We're not ready for this.  I am not doing this.  No.  Oh, God.  It's windy, too.  But we got St. Paddy's Day t-shirts for everybody today.  We got free food from Rivoli's of Tom's River waiting for everybody at XM.  Now, holy shit.  Oh, my God, this is cold.  Oh, gust of wind just hit.  Okay, this is fucking brutal.  Yeah.  This is like Weather Channel shit. 
[02:16:00]  No, it's great.  We just lost our crowd because they broke open the boxes of free t-shirts.  Of shirts, yeah.  My brother's t-shirts, you can find them at myradiostore.com, the St. Paddy's Day t-shirt, and they're  all back there getting their shirts, and we're like, fuck everybody.  We're getting to XM as fast as possible.  Things are icing up a little, Opie.  If you notice, the sidewalk's very slippery now.  I'll give, I don't know, $20 to anyone that is willing to sniff the inside of my hat.  That's right now.  No, I took it out of the laundry. 
[02:16:30]  This hat I wore all winter, and I'm like, all right, it's time to retire the hat, get  it washed, whatever.  And then the weather changed drastically.  Oh, so you pulled it out of the laundry.  I pulled it out of the laundry.  This freaking hat I'm wearing right now stinks to high hell.  Did it have some skid-marked underwear in it?  It might as well have.  There's a fireman with us.  We've got to make him go to the back of the line.  Oh, yeah.  This is fucking stupid.  This is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Of all the fucking days to bring back this stupid walkover, we pick a day where it's... 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, if Don Wicklin and Eric Logan, if they're listening, we retire the walk for another two weeks.  Get out of my way.  Get out of the way with your umbrella.  Oh, shit, I'm cold, lady.  Fuck.  Dumb whore.  We're not doing this on ice skates.  Might as well.  I just heard a gunshot behind me, and I don't even care.  I hope it was me.  I'm too cold.  All right.  Oh, this is bad. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, this is not fun.  Oh, not good at all.  What are we waiting for?  Yeah.  We're going to have a fucking street.  I'm not stopping for shit today.  Hey, cold enough for you?  It's...  It's...  Ice is falling from the sky.  Oh, my God.  It's, like, so cold.  And fucking frozen.  Well...  Oh...  Hey, oh, oh.  What happened?  Almost tripped Mr. Business Guy.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  The Pal Talk, uh...  Hammer rolling.  I don't know...  And it's fun to hold cold metal out here.  Yeah, no kidding.  Because I couldn't find the gloves.  I was able to get the hat out of the laundry, but I can't find the freaking gloves today.  That's why I dress like it's winter until, like, June.  You're smart.  Just in case.  Thank you.  All right, we gotta...  Holy shit, my fucking face is freezing.  That's all right.  How the hell does Biggie...  If it was full of cocks, it would be gay.  Biggie Smalls has another CD that's out.  New album out?  Is he touring?  He died 10 years ago. 
[02:18:30]  He has a better career than Rich Voss, and he's been dead for 10 years.  Biggie Smalls has a new CD coming out.  Voss's smally hands.  All right.  This is...  We're bringing everybody up.  Shit.  To enjoy the food from Rivoli's...  From Tom's River, but we can't stay out there.  Oh, this is...  It is beyond cold out there.  The wind's blowing.  Sleet in your eyes.  Let's hear an ammonia.  And the staff deal with everybody else and...  Hey, XM, we tried, but two more weeks without the walkover. 
[02:19:00]  That's just stupid.  That's absolutely what we have to do.  Hello, sir.  We'll see you upstairs in a couple minutes.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:19:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  THE END

[02:26:00]  This morning.  No, we're just going to eat.  What are we going to do today here?  I know here's something.  We've got a lot of stuff to do.  Is Patty coming in today?  I don't know.  I think she's part of the Ron and Fez show at this point.  Well, she's supposed to bring in her radio show.  Oh.  She's got her radio show, My Generation.  Yeah, apparently she cut something with Earl.  Uh-huh.  They did cut it up?  Like Earl put it together? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  So it's Patty with Earl Producing?  I believe so.  Oh, this should be a fucking horror.  I guess she's supposed to come in and submit it because she wants to do a Saturday show.  Right.  Good luck.  Good luck, Patty.  Let's say hi to Brian in Utah.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm trying to see what it's going to take to get some tickets to the Traveling Virus Tour because I can't afford them.  You guys want a little too much for them, so let's see what it takes.  Give me stuff. 
[02:27:00]  Well, the tickets went on sale for the Vegas show, April 14th, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, all the details on opiananthony.com.  But the headline is tickets are on sale right now through Ticketmaster.  It's going to sell out today.  I guarantee it.  I think that's a guarantee.  Was Pete smart enough to give us some tickets so we can give them away to some of our poor listeners?  No.  Hmm.  Because this is an expensive ticket.  And then you've got to figure out a lot of people are flying in, and then they're getting hotel rooms. 
[02:27:30]  It's expensive.  Yeah, we should get...  We need a few to just give away to people.  Get some freebies.  We need freebies.  I don't know what to tell you.  Hey, Brian.  Yeah.  Yeah, I really don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  How are you going to get to Vegas?  We can't afford the whole trip.  Well, I've got to drive because I live in Salt Lake.  It's going to cost me driving all the way down there and back in the hotel room and all that good stuff, you know.  Well, the pests are working...  $140 a ticket.  It's kind of creepy.  The pests are working together.  They're, like, sharing hotel rooms and stuff with complete strangers. 
[02:28:00]  Ew.  So how far are you?  You're going to drive how far?  From Salt Lake.  About a six-and-a-half-hour drive.  Well, you know what?  Email me at my...  Rich at richfox.com, and if I get...  If I'm allowed guests or whatever, I'll put you on the guest list.  I don't know if I am or what the deal is, but I will put you on mine.  You know what?  You're not allowed.  No, you'll probably have a ticket or two.  All right, Brian, hold on, because we'll get your...  We'll give you...  Well, how are we going to...  You should even...  I don't know.  We'll figure something out.  Stay there, Brian. 
[02:28:30]  Thanks.  All right.  Uh, let's go to Ron in New York.  Ron, what's up?  Are we going to do the same bit over and over again until everybody's just bleeding from  their ears, or what?  What are you talking about?  Uh, what?  I'm talking about the cake thing over Free FM.  We know you guys are better than everybody else on the radio.  Wait, talking about what?  Ron, what?  It says Jack and Kathy crap, or whatever those DJs' names were about, uh, you know, 
[02:29:00]  the whole cake eating contest.  Dude, oh my God.  It was not even fucking five minutes at the end of the show.  Did you hear?  We did fucking two hours and 55 minutes of...  You guys do it every day.  Every day you gotta react to the same thing.  Ron, keep it in perspective.  Oh my God.  I'm sick of you fuckers.  I'm so sick of the fucking message boards and sick of people like, then get your fucking  serious radio.  Oh, it's Friday.  Stop, stop, stop like...  I forgot it's Friday. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, stop threatening us and go get your fucking serious radio.  It's Friday.  If you don't like the fucking show, go somewhere else.  Howie's off.  It's Friday.  I forgot.  Why am I sensitive?  Because it's douchebags like that that are wrecking it for everybody else and they're  allowed to take over message boards and, you know, wreck everyone's day.  Go fuck yourself.  It was four fucking minutes today.  What other show gives you a radio show where maybe you don't like four minutes of a fucking  show?  Enough already.  I don't think he was a fan.  And a message to the message boards, enough. 
[02:30:00]  You guys are being had by Howard Stern fans and people that aren't even fans of the fucking  show and you let them take over the whole goddamn thing.  Enough.  Simple as this.  If you don't like the show, go somewhere else.  Like some guy's going to get on our case because he doesn't like one lousy four minute  bit.  I've had it.  You're going to do the whole bit over again.  Well, maybe we'll have a girl come in and sit on a vibrating dildo machine every fucking 
[02:30:30]  day.  How about that?  Every day.  I'm not stupid enough to think you're going to like every single minute of our radio show.  Duh.  But if it's a four minute bit, then that's a, that's a song you can listen to somewhere  else on the radio dial.  Go listen to a song and come back or never come back.  Whatever, man.  We have enough people that like the fucking show.  Four minutes out of 25 hours.  25 hours.  25 hours of original material.  And that's not good enough for some of these people. 
[02:31:00]  Four minutes.  It's amazing.  They'll nitpick any fucking thing.  It's amazing to me.  They have no idea how almost impossible it is to like entertain people for 25 hours a  week of original material.  But it's so fucking arrogant of people to tell you how to do your job when they never even  come close to doing it.  Well, this is how you should do it.  Oh, really?  And then they threaten.  Well, I'm going to go get a serious thing.  Go get your fucking serious unit.  See, here's how it works.  If enough people do that, then the show is to the point where no one's listening. 
[02:31:30]  And then this, guess what?  We go away.  That's how it works.  And your dream comes true.  Then we go away.  And we're gone.  Yuck.  He wasn't a fan.  Let's go to Adam in Connecticut.  Adam.  Hey.  Yes, sir.  Yes, you're on the air, sir.  No, I just wanted to point out something kind of funny.  Yeah.  Opie says, at this point, a lot. 
[02:32:00]  Do I?  What?  Yeah, it's just, I guess I got nothing better.  Oh, boy.  Do I really?  Well, at this point.  If I do, I'll work on it.  I think you should go fuck yourself.  All right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Too late.  Anyway.  Just so, enough already.  And then I do look at the message boards, and the message boards are being had.  It's like, are you this stupid?  You're letting people that are Howard Stern fans completely control your board and threads. 
[02:32:30]  Dummies.  And then they're like, well, it's free speech and whatever.  But it's not a fan site.  You're being hijacked by another radio show, and you're not smart enough to realize that.  Hmm.  Oh, my God.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer after the chicken parm.  That chicken parm was terrific.  But the marsala was even nicer with the hot peppers there, Anthony.  Oh, wonderful.  This is the best breakfast I've had in a while.  What's that big cake in the middle of the table? 
[02:33:00]  Apple crisp.  What?  Apple crisp.  I need a plate and a fork and meat.  Stat.  Stat.  And something to cut it with.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow, this place is getting very crowded.  Yeah, quite the crew out there.  And a lot more people, because the weather is so fucking abominable out there.  I thought there was going to be maybe three people standing out there.  I was pretty happy with the crowd.  Quite the crowd out there.  Yeah, definitely.  And they're all filing in.  And I think we're going to be able to interact with our studio audience a little while. 
[02:33:30]  After they're done with their fucking paperwork.  Do you want to do some material?  Maybe I'll do a little of the Starbucks tour out there, maybe.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  Why don't you warm up for your big gig at Wisecrackers?  And Wilkes-Barre.  I believe it's Wilkes-Barre, PA.  Oh, Wilkes-Barre.  You said it so many different ways.  I don't even know what it means.  I don't know the right...  Are you all right over there?  I want cake.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:00]  That's how the bitch does.  That's how the bitch does.  If that was the last piece, I would have been pissed.  Fucking Anthony just cut himself a huge piece of this apple or whatever cake.  It's not apple pie.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It looks so good.  He's trying to walk by Rich, and Rich just knocks the whole fucking thing out of his head.  Yeah, crumbs went into my face.  There you go.  Ah, you fuck. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, that's fucking good.  That's why we play the Janet and Nick audio.  See, it always leads to something.  Leads to a fine moment.  Dude, man, you had some anger.  I turned around.  He smacked it squared fucking down out of my hand, and crumbs came flying up into my face.  Yeah, like it was a diving board.  Yeah.  Fucking red.  It's all over you, bro.  I know.  It's everywhere.  You got, like, powder in the middle of your face. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, look at this.  I got powdered sugar on me.  That's because I'm sweet.  Let's go to British Bulldog.  British Bulldog, what's up?  Hey, good morning, Owen.  Hey, this will make I be happy.  It's not why I called, but I'm a truck driver, obviously.  Got the brand new Sirius in the dash.  Never turn the fucker on.  I've got XM sitting right on top of it.  Anyway, so why I called, I was, I want to hear some more of that dreadful audio.  I want to hear the reserve in the back pocket Sam CD, just in case he fucked up this week. 
[02:35:30]  Did he have one?  I thought it sounded, you know, really, really funny when it made it sound like Nick was trying some cock.  Yeah, really.  Trying some cock and eating some cum.  And by the way, people are saying, why are you letting these, letting that guy get to you?  I'll tell you why, because I'm trying to make a point.  A true fan of the Opie and Anthony show is not going to call because they didn't like one lousy four-minute segment of the fucking show.  Yeah.  The true fans would, if they realized we're sucking for the entire day or day after day, then they would start calling like, dude, what the fuck's up? 
[02:36:00]  But as soon as you call because you didn't like four minutes of a bit, you're not a fan.  And if he's listening to it so much that he heard every single time we've done that, then he's listening all the time.  So then he is a fucking fan.  I love the people that think that we just have.  There's times when I've got to turn you guys down because I'm fucking laughing so hard I'm nearly crying and I can't drive straight on the road.  But, you know, yeah, move on.  This show is like, it's going to be a roller coaster. 
[02:36:30]  We're going to be on some major highs and then we're going to dip down into some lows.  I love the people that think we just have nothing but radio gold in our back pockets and like they don't understand why we're not playing those cards.  Like, why aren't you playing those cards?  Why the same thing?  Well, maybe because we thought it was funny and we could get something out of it.  All I can think of now is, but Rich, I earned that cake.  Oh, no, Rich.  Why did you do that?  All right, let's go to James.  What's up, James?  Everyone warming up finally from that walkover? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  What's up, James?  Rich Ross is a real good comic.  I love him.  A bunch of friends of mine and I were going to go see him when he was coming into the neighborhood.  What an asshole he is.  Why?  His promos that he does, oh, the guys, you'll find out.  You can figure it out yourself.  We couldn't find it.  We called.  We made phone calls trying to find out where this place in Quakertown was.  But he goes, oh, the firehouse in Quakertown.  Well, there's a bunch of firehouses in Quakertown. 
[02:37:30]  Rich?  Well, listen, here's the thing.  That Quakertown gig, you're lucky.  I didn't feel good.  I was sick.  It was horrible.  Were you in Allentown area?  Yes, I am.  Okay.  All right.  He's saying put more info in your plugs, Rich.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Let's go to Chief on Long Island.  Chief, what's up?  Yeah, I'm so sick and tired of these people calling up bitching about something they don't  like on the show.  You know what?  Tell him to flush his XM down the freaking toilet and go fuck his mom. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, Jesus Christ.  It really gets frustrating.  It gets frustrating after a while because every bit we do, we have people liking it, and  then we have people that don't like it, and they go somewhere else or whatever.  They understand the show.  That's exactly...  But that guy didn't like that bit, and they think it's getting a little...  He personally thinks he's a little tired.  No.  Instant feedback is piling in from people that love that particular bit.  So, to them, they like it.  And to them, maybe they only heard maybe a couple times that we've done it out of the  many times that we actually did it, if that makes sense. 
[02:38:30]  That guy was an ass.  That's exactly what I do.  If there's something I'm not interested in, I'll go check a song out.  I'll go fuck around.  Whatever.  I'll come back, and it's...  I like just about 90% of everything you guys do, but there's still some shit that,  you know...  I'll tell you right now.  If you like 90% of the show, that's massive.  I honestly think the average listener that would consider themselves a faithful listener  is barely over 50% of what they actually like.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Definitely. 
[02:39:00]  You know, the average...  Right on.  Whatever.  I could get into stats all day long.  Ooh, stats.  On regular radio, someone that would call themselves a fan of a radio show listens way less than  an hour every day.  Yeah.  Way less.  It's pretty much their commute, which is...  You know, some people do have the longer commute, but in general, it's like 20 minutes  a day.  That's all they catch.  That's not bad.  And they're the ones that would go out of the way to tell someone else about the show  because they're, you know, faithful listeners of the show.  Yeah.  If you're a stand-up comic, if someone like me or a Norton or a Patrice, if someone doesn't 
[02:39:30]  walk out on your show, then you're not doing your job.  If they don't fucking leave.  If you don't have a couple of people leave or pissed off, then Patrice throws people out.  Rod, why are you back?  Yeah.  You guys hung up on me, man.  What's with this, you know, I have to be a little constructive...  Rod, you made your point and I made my point.  Do you think that was constructive criticism?  It's not constructive criticism.  You know, I didn't like a little piece of a bitch and then you guys got to go...  Why are you going out of...  Hold on, Rod.  Yeah, let's call it.  Why are you going out of your way to call up a show that you supposedly like to say that 
[02:40:00]  you didn't like one four-minute segment?  You know how ridiculous that is, seriously, if you really think about it?  You guys say, call if you don't like it, we'll take your calls, we don't care, we'll  face anybody.  We do.  And then, you know, you want to have the phone.  Rod, we faced you.  I saw you, I didn't have to go to you.  We faced you and we let you say what you said and then...  And we put your back on.  And we strongly disagreed, so what's the problem there? 
[02:40:30]  I just think you guys get a little fucking carried away with this shit sometimes, man.  It's just, sometimes you don't have to beat a dead horse, you know what I mean?  We thought the bit was funny.  Beat a dead horse.  Hey, Rod, Rod, Rod, Rod.  But that's your opinion.  I'm looking at other opinions where they're like, keep the bit going, I really like that  bit.  And it's not old to me.  And do you know most people don't listen that much that they would have heard that  bit every time we did it?  Do you understand that?  Well, I'm going to like you guys, man.  You're saying I'm not a fucking fan.  I've been listening to this N.E.W.  days.  When you walk out on your favorite band because of one song you don't like? 
[02:41:00]  And Rod, you know that we even overthink it to the point where today we decided to do  that bit late in the show because we've done that bit earlier in the show, in the middle  of the show, because we're even thinking on that level to move it around a little bit  just in case, because supposedly every 15 or 20 minutes the audience is changing.  So we even try on our end to at least move it around just in case you happen to be only  listening to the show, let's say, from 7.30 to 8 every day.  So we're like, all right, in the 7.30 hour yesterday, we played this, so let's do something 
[02:41:30]  different in that hour.  In the past five shows, out of those five shows, how many times do you think you've played  that bit?  We did it four times this week out of five days.  And hopefully four times.  Don't you think it's getting a little redundant?  Oh, my God.  Do you, wait.  You don't understand the normal listener.  Rod, it's so easy just to yell and scream, but I won't.  You said you're a fan from N.E.W. days, right?  Do you remember when we would do a bit and we would replay it in the same show, sometimes 
[02:42:00]  twice, so it would be heard three times in one show, and then the next day we played again?  Do you remember those days or you forgot?  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, you got two radio shows now.  You think you'd fucking be able to do a little bit more?  Oh, my God.  See, if I listed all the bits we did this week, it would make your head spin.  And then that, and then you have to, if you're such a big fan, why did you go like, oh, just  get serious?  And like, what is that, like a threat? 
[02:42:30]  He's just an asshole.  People are reminding us we should play the Leprechaun news story in honor of St. Paddy's  Day.  We could do that.  Why don't we do that, regroup?  I think all the listeners are in.  Everyone's trying to eat.  Are people still getting in?  Eric, Eric.  Holy shit.  How many people are?  Wow.  100.  Isn't he in jail?  Oh, dude, you look like the dude that went to jail.  You know that, right?  I know that's a visual, but you look like him.  Look at the guys on the couch.  If that doesn't look like... 
[02:43:00]  Yes, I do.  The guys on the couch, if that doesn't look like the evolution of I don't get laid poster  right there.  Holy shit.  It goes from goofy to fucking just a mess.  Hey, Rich, we had an idea that you were going to do the Starbucks tour for everybody.  Yeah.  I want to make it a little different.  What?  I think you would be braver if you stayed on this side of the glass, so it's like prison  comedy.  Prison comedy?  You might do prison comedy today.  Prison comedy?  Where you just stand up right in front of the window, get a mic stand that goes all the  way up, and you do your material, but you're protected with glass. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that's great.  Right.  Bulletproof comedy.  That's why I don't have to buy my taser that I wanted to get.  Right.  Bulletproof.  That's like two panes of glass, and I think each one is at least two inches thick.  I told you about the Vegas girl throwing a drink at me.  No.  We got reports about that.  We haven't heard the story yet.  Yeah.  Yeah, I told you the story.  Last time I was in about...  No, but there's another story.  There's another story.  That's what I'm talking about, yeah.  I was in Poughkeepsie. 
[02:44:00]  Maybe it's you.  And some girl threw a burning candle at me.  Burning candle.  And an ONA fan went to block it, right?  Wait, she got pissed off and she picked up the candle off the table?  She picked the candle off the table and heaved it at me, right?  Because her boyfriend said, whatever.  You know, I was only on stage for a triple cunt.  And some ONA fan blocks it, right?  And then all the candle wax gets all over his girl, right?  Oh, shit.  Right?  All in her hair. 
[02:44:30]  You know, now I got to buy them drinks on the house.  But it was a nightmare.  Just people feel...  You know, only fucking comedy.  No one ever goes to a Broadway play, sits and texts their friends or throws things.  Or show more emotion.  You know what I mean?  Or I hate that fucking scene.  Comedy...  You're a court jester.  It's fucking...  No respect.  It's just...  She threw a fucking candle at me and walked out.  Like, I said to her, I said, grab her and have her arrested.  What did you say that got her fucking pissed? 
[02:45:00]  Her boyfriend...  She was just sitting here with, like, such an attitude, not laughing at anything.  I go, what the fuck is your problem, right?  What, do you want me to run back and forth on the stage or smash the water?  I'll tell you what that problem is.  What?  She...  The guy's a huge fan of yours and probably the radio show.  And just...  I love it when this happens and you're convinced your wife or girlfriend is going to just love  it.  So you drag him in and then you realize it was a huge mistake.  Uh-oh.  Hating it.  Hating you.  And saying it.  And now hates her husband or boyfriend that dragged her into the comedy club. 
[02:45:30]  Well, they start...  It's just not her, quote, cup of tea.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I said, what the fuck is your problem?  She's sitting there twirling her neck.  And I go to her boyfriend who's laughing.  Like, what the fuck is her problem?  And he goes, ah, fuck her.  I cut her tongue out.  And I go, good.  And I said something like, good, now, you know, now you don't have to put any effort  when you eat a pussy or something.  Boom.  Candle.  Candle.  But a fan running like, you know, Secret Service to block the candle from you.  That's nice.  He's going to take a bullet for you.  Yeah.  It was cool.  Well, it wasn't cool. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Sacrificed his girlfriend.  Let's say hi to Colin in New Jersey.  Colin, what's up?  Yo, fellas.  First of all, Opie, is everything okay?  Are you okay?  I'm a little concerned.  No, fine.  Are you okay?  It was just a little flare-up.  Picture your grandmother naked calling the show.  I was all happy today.  Yeah, what about that bit?  That was an original O&A bit right there.  My dad.  That we're going to develop in the coming weeks you watch. 
[02:46:30]  Picture your aunt.  You know us.  It's going to end up with some, like, old couple fucking in front of us.  Who wants to volunteer their grandma?  I know a lady in Florida.  Jesus.  All right, Colin.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  All right, guys.  Frunk is you.  Jim in New Mexico.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  We've been at a house fire here about the last three and a half hours.  Well, we're picking up the hose.  I pull up my truck, turn on my XM so we can listen to you guys. 
[02:47:00]  You guys are entertaining the piss out of all of us.  We're laughing our ass off.  You can tell that guy to go fuck himself.  And he won't be sitting next to me in Vegas, but off to you boys on the 14th.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, tickets are going fast.  We've got to get Pete on the phone.  I want to get a ticket count through Ticketmaster for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show, April  14th in Vegas.  Jim.  Yeah.  How's the fire going?  Well, we got it out.  It was a condo.  Saved the ones around it.  It was a pretty good save.  We lost one, though.  Some idiot came in here, splashed and dashed. 
[02:47:30]  Splashed and dashed.  And it was disrupted our night, but what the heck, you know, that's what we're here for.  But, hey, you guys made the last hour of this very enjoyable.  Everybody's laughing their ass off.  Can't even roll up the hose and stuff, do everything right.  Because we're listening to you guys.  So that guy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.  It was a splash and dash.  I've never heard of that.  A little arson.  Throw some gas in there, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  Hey, thanks, guys.  See you in Vegas.  All right, yeah.  Sounds good.  Yeah, the Pest Out West, they're going to be joining the Vegas show. 
[02:48:00]  I wonder if that – I'm just wondering if someone can beat that story, listening to the show as they put out a fire.  Like, people listen to the show as they're doing, like, just strange, horrific things.  If you can beat that, give us a call.  Patrick in Indiana.  Patrick.  Hey, man, what's up?  I listen every day to you guys.  You guys make me laugh about 95% of the time.  But this bit is wonderful.  You guys need to expand it.  Like, the TV ministers, these religious zealots on the radio, you guys need to expand the bit. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, not a bad idea.  Make these really goody two-shoes even – make them sound even worse.  Cartoons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The funny thing is, like, you know, get your Jerry Falwells out there.  The funny thing is, that guy just called the wrong day because we actually rested the bit yesterday thinking,  all right, let's rest of the day and bring it back one more time on Friday before we say goodbye to those doofes in Buffalo.  All right, Patrick.  Thank you so much, sir.  Thank you, guys.  You're great.  All right. 
[02:49:00]  Why don't we play the leprechaun bit?  Starker Patty is here.  Yep.  Woo.  Yeah, we want to try out her radio show.  She's got it all produced, ready to go.  Wait, H-Cup Jane is here.  When are you going to flash everybody?  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  When they put their shirts on.  What do you mean when they put their shirts on?  Oh, my gosh.  She says when they put their shirts on, everyone just jumped up and started putting on their, uh, their wow green shirts.  Giant tits, man.  Courtesy of Brother Elmo on MySpace. 
[02:49:30]  Brother Elmo, MySpace.  Just giant.  Jesus, they're massive when she's in a sweater.  Big as your fucking head.  Guys, guys, what do you think of H-Cup Jane?  Her shirt has stretch marks.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  That shirt didn't have those lines in it before she put it on.  All right, well, she's going to flash everyone.  Everyone just threw their shirts on real fast.  It says, wow me, I'm Irish.  Her nipples are poking through a thick winter sweater.  Yeah.  No shit. 
[02:50:00]  Look at them.  They are.  Her nipples are bigger than some girl's tits I've been with.  Look at those.  Cold.  It's cold.  Hey, she's just, wow, look.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Jesus.  She could be wearing like a Kevlar fucking vest and you'd see her nipples through them.  And a heavy, uh, winter sweater.  Yeah.  All right, listen to this.  Oh!  Wow.  Stupid house.  We thought she was wearing a bra.  That's why.  Jesus.  Yeah.  They don't move.  No, they don't.  Kind of a problem.  They don't move.  Don't you want a little bounce on your boob?  I know.  Let's be honest here. 
[02:50:30]  I'm not going to lie.  They almost look like tumors.  They are big.  Hey, does she want to, hey, you want to jerk off some guys today?  Whoa.  Look at her.  Nice.  She's a, she's a swinger.  You want to jerk off some guys as your husband watches?  Maybe you could like do the, uh, what's it called?  There's a term for it when you're working, oh, the double pumper or the, uh, there was  a, it's the walrus.  No, it's called low self-esteem. 
[02:51:00]  Listen, you would think after that breast job, those beautiful breasts, you would have  them trim the hair on the nipples there.  This hair on the nipples?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Look at it right there.  No, I'm only kidding.  Oh, boy.  Are you picky?  Am I picky?  Turn around and pose again.  Yeah, turn around.  They got their cameras out.  There was H-Cup Jane.  Photo walk.  Is her husband here, too?  Yeah, right there in the yellow sweater.  That's her husband?  Yeah, they, they, they had sex on, uh, the camera last week.  He looks like he just, he looks like he just jumped off a yacht and she looks like she  just jumped off a black basketball player. 
[02:51:30]  You knew it was funny before you even finished, you ass.  Coming alive on XM.  Rich Voss.  All right, and Stalker Patty, you bring your radio show?  Earl has it.  Where's Earl?  Earl, what the fuck?  Patty, Earl was supposed to have given it to you so you could come in and fucking give  it to us today.  He never did.  Fucking Earl.  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:00]  He, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Patty, get on a mic.  He knew that today was, shut up.  He knew that today was the day that you were coming in with your radio show and, and we  were, we were going to play it on our show and see how you, you, your show sounds.  Because you want to do a Saturday show called My Generation, which is about like the 60s and  the music and some inane babble that you do.  And, and, and, and Earl produced it and was supposed to give it to you so you could give it to us. 
[02:52:30]  He even said it.  I heard it on the show yesterday.  He said, yeah, Patty's bringing it to Opie and Anthony tomorrow.  Well, he didn't give me anything to bring.  You know, he's late for everything.  How did the recording session go?  Well, when I, I don't, I'm not sure.  I learned about two radio terms I've never heard before.  He kept telling me to back sell, back sell.  He kept telling me first and last out.  What was the other one?  He said, kill yourself? 
[02:53:00]  No.  Back sell.  Her pants are two different tones.  It looks like she pissed right down the middle of her legs.  Yeah, Patty, you're wearing like.  Those pants are fucking horrible.  Tell her that they are.  It's the new style.  All the kids are wearing them.  Acid wash.  Yeah.  I guess.  Acid wash jeans.  You're only a decade behind at this point.  Yeah, you're closing in on the right decade there, Patty.  Well, can we get the audio?  Where's Earl?  Let's freaking, we'll get it.  Get that.  Oh, we're going to get it?  Fucking no good. 
[02:53:30]  Producer.  Where's that sparkling wiggle?  Exactly.  I heard you guys out there.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're going to find it in the system.  Yeah.  We got a party today, man.  We got a lot of people.  Thanks for doing the walk.  I mean, the weather's awful.  We got a fine crowd.  H-Cup, can we count on you today to do something crazy?  It depends on what crazy is.  Nah. 
[02:54:00]  Put your husband tit-fuck you.  What?  You don't care?  Would you, you would do that in front of all these animals?  Probably not.  Oh.  Yeah, see.  How about goofy guy handjob?  We find the goofiest guy here.  Yes!  Goofy guy handjob!  Handjob!  Oh, Rick just wants a handjob.  Would you go goofy guy handjob?  How about this?  You just take something and just smack some guy's unit with it. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, there's probably a guy into it.  We got to work on this.  Yeah, we'll think of something.  She'll do something.  Oh, what's that?  What's that?  What?  What do you got?  You found it?  Yeah.  All right, good.  Could you rummage through his office?  Oh, my God.  It's 58 minutes long.  Jesus, Patty.  That's the introduction.  We'll just sample through it.  We'll sample through it.  Could someone, like, maybe sample through this a little bit?  Sure.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, sure.  All right, listen.  Why don't we play the Leprechaun News Story in honor of St. Patty's Day? 
[02:55:00]  We'll continue with the past.  Rich Voss, when we get back, we'll do Rich Voss first.  Then we can do that.  Maybe we'll get some highlights from Patty's My Generation radio show.  But next, Rich Voss does prison comedy with these animals.  You guys want to hear that or what?  Yeah!  Sophie and Anthony.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community,  many of you bringing binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it looks like a Leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of a tree.  Who else in the Leprechaun say yeah? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah!  Eyewitnesses say the Leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the Leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  It could be a crackhead that got hold to the wrong stuff and it told them to get up in a tree and play a Leprechaun. 
[02:56:00]  We don't get down to the bottom of this.  Yes, there's on there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the Leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This war is all spells right here.  This is a special Leprechaun flute which has been passed down from thousands of years ago from my great-great-grandfather who was Irish.  I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree. 
[02:56:30]  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want the gold.  Give me the gold.  I want the gold.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM.  Who goes the weasel? 
[02:57:00]  Ramon, give me your sleeve.  Come on, Dennis.  Thank you, sir.  We're back with the Opiate Anthony Show.  A little St. Paddy's Day party going on.  Hi.  Hi.  Shaving up to be a nice show.  We got Rivoli's here from Tom's River.  You know, we wanted breakfast food, but chicken parm is just as good, right?  Absolutely. 
[02:57:30]  I enjoyed it.  The food is excellent no matter what time of day you eat it.  Also, we got H-Cup Jane here.  We're trying to figure out what awful thing we could do with her today.  Did she run out of here?  Is she hiding?  Hey, H-Cup.  She's trying to hide.  There she is.  H-Cup.  That's what I was sort of thinking.  Actually, someone is thinking just like we are.  H-Cup, can we throw shit on your boobs later?  Lasagna Bukkake.  Lasagna.  Huh?  Lasagna Bukkake. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  Dan, get a mic on her.  Here's the deal.  I'll explain.  You see Stalker Paddy?  Yes.  Hi, Paddy.  She made a Bukkake video.  Oh, God.  Like a fake Bukkake video.  Yeah, it wasn't real.  It was like jizz.  No.  Here's the bit.  H-Cup, here's the bit.  You can even watch the video of what we did to Paddy.  And we did it to her face, but we want to do it to your boobs today.  Yeah.  And all it is is like whatever we can find around the joint.  You lay down and you take, I don't know, like a minute of goodness.  A minute of goodness. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Everything from milk to lotion.  Condiments.  Yeah.  To dignity.  To dignity.  Yeah.  Hatch up.  Oh, we're going to mom's after, so I have to be a little.  Well, just take all your clothes off and we got towels and just towel off and you're out of here.  Yeah, and you go in the bathroom and wash up a little.  Yeah, you got to give us the showstopper today.  All right, let me see the video.  Let's go to the video.  Oh, God.  Listen.  No, you don't.  You're really good.  You're taking me a quick.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:59:00]  Back in high school?  That's how I show the video.  Hey, listen, if you have tits that big, you got to put them to use.  What's the sense of having tits like that?  There's no freebies with this show.  People have to understand that.  Always work.  Oh, I got it.  Here's another one.  That Pamela girl from the other day thinks we just want to hang out with her.  No, we don't.  Make out with a girl or hit the sidewalk.  All right, here's the thing.  And we take our tits and we draw like a target.  Yeah.  And we'll have some of these guys shooting spitballs.  Meatballs.  Spitballs at our tits.  And whoever gets the closest gets to spank it on our back. 
[02:59:30]  I'm trying to be creative.  Hey, do we have a powerful flashlight?  Cherry darts.  We were supposed to do boobie lantern with you.  Oh, boobie lantern.  Yeah, we need like a big flashlight, like a maglite or something like that.  Yeah, Mars, if you got some powerful flashlights, we could use those today as well.  We're just making shit up as we go.  Stalker Patty's here.  We got her My Generation show.  She handed in finally.  My Generation.  And we got Rich Voss, who's playing Wisecrackers next weekend in Wilkes-Barre, PA. 
[03:00:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  Wilkes-bear.  Wilkes-bear.  You want to do some comedy for these folks or what?  Yeah, I'll do a set.  I don't know.  I mean, I'll do a set.  I always do a set.  I love doing stand-up.  All right, give Rich a mic.  It's going to be prison comedy, actually.  We're not going to have you out there with the animals.  I'm going to stand in front of the window like this.  Yeah.  And you guys can hear me out there, right?  No way.  Especially this guy.  Look at those ears.  Holy shit.  What do you use? 
[03:00:30]  His earmuffs?  Pillows?  Here's the thing.  So, what?  Was that mean or something?  Was that too mean to start off?  It was just mean.  I'm sorry.  One way to put it.  I'm sorry.  That is quite mean.  All right.  Mean for the people that were hoping to laugh.  Am I going to introduce myself?  No, we'll have Stalker Patty introduce you.  Yeah, Patty introduce Rich.  And I'm sorry.  You're not mad at me, are you?  Yeah, I'll just wait for you.  Yeah.  I'll just touch your ears and you'll freak out.  All right, wait.  Let's get it.  Get a piece of purse, boss.  All right.  See, Rich thought.  I know how you think, by the way. 
[03:01:00]  What?  He thought he already started, but he started with a bomb, so he's now making believe he's  just kind of...  Oh, no, no, no.  I wasn't starting now.  They got to...  All right.  I got to make sure.  Get off stage.  Get off stage.  So, this is prison comedy.  Boss will stand in front of this huge window and face the ONA pest.  Emcee the crowd there, Patty.  Get out and say, you know...  No, get outside there.  Perk them up a little bit and...  Yeah.  You can take your headphones off.  Yeah.  You'll hear us, all right?  And you got to give them a joke, Patty.  You got one joke?  Yeah.  The emcee always has a few jokes just to kind of warm up the crowd. 
[03:01:30]  Any joke.  And then you announce their headliner, Rich Voss.  We don't want to...  We don't want to...  We don't want to...  We don't want to...  We don't want to...  We don't want to...  Oh, boy.  We don't want to...  We hate you, Patty.  That's going to be tough.  We hate you, Patty.  We hate you, good morning.  We hate you, good morning.  We hate you, Patty.  Good morning.  Introducing the one and only...  No, no, you dummy.  You fucking dummy.  No.  Oh, are you stupid...  Dumb as a fucking stump.  Hey, hey, hey, Patty.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  All right, listen. 
[03:02:00]  Here's what you got to do.  You guys have seen a few comedy shows because they're like...  They're walking their throat.  Yeah.  First you do.  Patty, you got to come out and you got to greet the crowd and how you're doing, but you got  to get them up for the show.  So what you got to do is tell them who you are and then tell a joke.  Welcome them to this comedy club, whatever it's called.  What's the club called?  It's called Maximum Security Comedy.  Maximum Security Comedy.  And maybe like point someone out in the crowd and kind of goof on them a little in good fun,  you know, good natured way.  Ask where they're from and just have a little thing with them. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, and say where you're from and like a little back and forth with the crowd.  Warm them up.  Get them all ready.  And lay off the guy's ears.  And then you go, are you ready for your headliner?  And then they'll all clap and you say, ladies and gentlemen, Jim Norton.  That's right.  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to Maximum Security Comedy.  My name is...  I'm throwing shit at her already.  I want to welcome you all to the... 
[03:03:00]  My name is...  ...of the Opie and Anthony studio.  Yeah, what's your name, you dummy?  Come on, get with your...  All right, you want her to start over?  This is...  Yeah, start over.  See, I'm...  You know, you guys started...  Let them know who you are.  Yeah.  Good morning.  This is me, Stalker Patty.  You sound like owls.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  Be more funny.  Be more funny.  If I was any funnier...  No, it's a big son.  Wait, she's got a joke.  If I was any funnier, I would be depressed.  Fudgy haunted.  What?  Depressed.  But anyway, I want to welcome you all to Prison Comedy.  No, Max... 
[03:04:00]  So, where is everybody from?  Is there anybody here from other than the tri-state area?  No.  No.  How many people are here from New Jersey?  No.  How many people are here from New York?  No.  Then you all must be from out of space, then.  Are you ready for your headliner? 
[03:04:30]  I wanted to work the crowd a little more.  Yeah, work the crowd a little more.  Work the crowd, Patty.  Pick out one person.  You didn't introduce me?  Patty.  Patty.  Patty, you dummy.  Pick out, like, a person in the crowd and go, hey, you,  and then, like, kind of make fun of something about them,  good-naturedly, you know.  Just go, hey, you know, where'd you get that hat? 
[03:05:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, stalker, Pat.  Hey.  You did good with the joke,  but now you gotta just make fun of a random person out there.  Yeah, work the crowd.  Look, find someone that looks a little off.  I think most of the people in the room...  Besides you.  Oh, hey, another joke.  Okay, terrific.  Besides you, you freak.  Boring.  Come on, let's go.  Come on, Patty.  Handle the heckler.  I'm not fucking Irish.  He's black. 
[03:05:30]  I'm a Negro.  Is he real?  Did he must...  Where is he?  I'm a white Negro.  Oh, hard.  On the negative side.  Oh, yeah!  Hey, yo.  What the hell is he talking about?  I'm a white Negro, Patty.  Okay.  Terrific.  You'll get Al Sharpton on your ass.  Yeah, I'll get Al Sharpton on your ass and Jesse Jackson.  You're letting the crowd take control, Patty.  Put those hecklers in their place.  Go ahead.  Your whole job is to get the crowd ready for Rich Voss.  What are you going to do, Patty?  I'm going to tell you a mommy.  Come on.  Put them in their place. 
[03:06:00]  That's easy.  I don't have my mommy.  Yes!  That's right.  That's right.  I've got to follow dead relative jokes.  Okay.  Come on, get harsh on them, Patty.  They're heckling you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Why you?  I know I am, but what are you?  You're a big meanie.  No, I'm a blue meanie.  I'm a big Beatles fan. 
[03:06:30]  The blue?  Oh, my God.  It's the time for Rich Voss to say anything.  I'm ready to bail.  Just call them, Patty.  Just call them.  All right.  Ask them if they're ready for their headliner.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you ready for your headliner?  I think I got the wave cleared for you, Rich.  In this case, they're actually yelling for you.  Well, you got...  Oh.  Wow.  What?  They're going for us?  You're a little crap.  Wow.  That wasn't quite an introduction, Patty. 
[03:07:00]  You've got to introduce them.  No, get back out there.  No, Patty, it's ladies and gentlemen.  You're a headliner.  You might have seen them on.  Ladies and gentlemen, and now for your headliner.  Are you ready for your headliner?  You're ready for your headliner.  We told you, Patty.  Stop saying head.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  And now.  Get off.  Now.  Oh, no.  She said something after the name.  You're never supposed to do that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[03:07:30]  You are the worst, Patty.  Wow.  Here he is, Rich Voss.  Let's have a big hand for Patty.  Patty.  MC means moronic cunt.  Patty.  Look.  You've got to move over to the side.  A scoliosis victim has better posture than you.  Patty there.  How's it going, folks?  Welcome to the ONA St. Patrick's Day party.  Obviously, we have Ben's brother here, so the whole family's not working. 
[03:08:00]  Happy New Year.  How long are you supposed to say Happy New Year for?  I go until August.  Is that too late?  Happy New Year, Moss.  You know, New Year is the most overrated holiday.  And there's always that one friend that this is going to be my year.  Everybody, this is my year, right?  Okay.  What about the last 23 years?  How about that?  Why be so selfish?  Throw yourself off a roof.  Then it will be your family's year.  You know what I'm saying?  Don't fuck with me.  I'll bring Patty back.  Now listen to me.  Okay? 
[03:08:30]  I'm just warming up right now.  All New Year's is to me is to take your dumb Christmas decorations down.  They should only be allowed up for two weeks.  People that hang Christmas decorations are saying, hey, we're not Jews.  That's all they're saying.  Okay?  I'm a Jew.  I know.  Fuck your decorations and fuck your blow-up snowmen.  Okay?  I stabbed four of them this year.  Now, why does that guy have his sunglasses?  Are you the cool fan?  Well, I want to stare at Buffalo Paul's young relatives.  What's that?  Take off your glasses and kiss the cute boy next to you. 
[03:09:00]  Look at that.  Look at his...  He looks like you should be on a bus in a Clint Eastwood movie, that guy.  And you can't even get, like, a real black audience fan.  You have a half a black guy in the back, right?  And this white, black, Irish leprecoon right here.  This is the gathering of Santa's broken toys coming for free food.  All right?  Holy...  We should be selling workout videos here. 
[03:09:30]  We make nothing.  Okay?  The Asian girl, whatever you are.  Is that your boyfriend next to you?  The one who thinks he's Kevin Smith?  Huh?  Is that your boyfriend?  Okay?  How long have you two been going out?  Two years.  What?  Two years.  Two years?  What do you guys meet at?  Lastchance.com?  How disaster.  That's the boyfriend and girlfriend thing right there.  These two, okay? 
[03:10:00]  Holy shit.  Look at these fucking misshapen heads.  I'm telling you.  Tonight when I'm fucking my wife, I'm going to think of your head to keep from coming.  Okay?  I'm just fucking with you.  Don't get crazy, all right?  Don't do anything stupid like brush your teeth.  Anyhow.  You fucking walking jackass.  Come on, let's see those tits right there.  Come on.  Look at that.  Wow.  Daddy's disappointments.  And your husband, you and your husband are swingers? 
[03:10:30]  Maybe, can I come over by myself?  Just can I owe you somebody?  Have you ever been with a black guy?  No.  No?  Racist, why?  Because your husband can't follow it, can he?  Look how tight his pants are.  I can see his nuts and a nickel.  Look at those little fucking, your husband's a half a fag that's going to have a yeast infection by the end of the day.  With a fucking yellow sweater.  The only reason he wants another couple is so he can look at cock.  Come out of the closet now and to party.  Right now, just tell everybody, I want, look at this guy. 
[03:11:00]  He's just talking to himself in the middle there.  You.  This guy right there.  Everybody's had an uncle.  Let it go.  You.  It'll get better.  Fucking half a fag.  It's fucking true.  I swear to God.  I'm trying to find the coolest one here.  You.  Yeah, there you go.  Look at this.  This guy, half a black guy.  You're black and Chinese, aren't you?  You can open a fruit stand and boycott it at the same time. 
[03:11:30]  Look at these fucking three guys.  Can you imagine being a girl on an island with these street guys?  You have to fuck a tree.  You know what I'm saying?  When's the last time you got laid with the glasses right here?  Uh, four days ago.  Four days ago?  No, I mean with a person.  How long?  All right.  You have a girlfriend?  Yes.  No fucking way do you have a girlfriend.  Does she know it?  What?  Does she know it?  Yeah.  And where is she now?  At work.  At work?  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  You call it work.  Same people call it freshman.  Anyhow.  That means she's young.  That one kind of flopped on that one.  That's all right.  They're not all killers.  So far, it's not bad.  It's not a bad crew either.  What do you do for a living?  I work at the Apple store.  You work where?  At the Apple store.  At the Apple store?  Yeah.  What are the odds you work with computers?  Who would you guess?  And how about right there?  Cockblock.  Where does he work?  Is this what's wrong with him? 
[03:12:30]  Wow.  Is this like a make-a-wish show?  I work with a port-a-dark.  You know something?  Make-a-wish.  I just want to laugh one more time.  He looks like a child molester.  He looks like a child molester?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  And you don't look like you've been on Dateline either.  Shut up.  Sit down.  Have some lemonade.  I'll be right out.  Thank you.  Look at that girl.  She's pretty all the way in the back right there.  Look at that.  You work here, or are you a fan?  I'm a fan.  No fucking way.  Yeah.  Look how big her eyes are, too.  It's like she just got rammed in the ass. 
[03:13:00]  What's your...  Well, her eyes are popping out of her.  What do you want me to do?  It's a comedy show.  You want fucking poetry?  Hope you go to Soho.  Okay?  This is all I got.  All right?  I got fucking...  I want to say wow in a good way.  Jesus.  What's your name there, butterfly?  Kim.  Kim?  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  Why?  What's wrong?  Are you one of those girls?  There's got to be something wrong, because you're pretty.  Do you cry during sex?  Are you one of those?  Not at all.  I don't believe I'm doing this again.  I told myself I'd stop.  Are you a cutter?  No.  Why don't you have a boyfriend? 
[03:13:30]  You're good-looking...  If there's one guy here you could pick, besides the half-a-fag swinger, which one would you  leave with?  Please don't put me on the spot like that.  What's that?  Please don't put me on the spot like that.  Please don't put me on the spot?  Look what I have to fucking do.  Don't put me on the spot.  I'm standing behind a fucking aquarium trying to make fucking mutants laugh.  Don't put me on the spot.  What the fuck?  Jesus Christ.  I sold my sofa to yourself five fucking years ago on the steps in D.C.  Go fuck yourself and don't put me on the spot. 
[03:14:00]  Answer the question.  Which one of these fucking mutants would you fuck?  Jesus Christ.  Don't put me on the spot.  I've been tortured for five fucking years.  I can't even get ten people in the room.  I don't even know if I hit bonus here in this studio.  We needed ten more people for you to hit bonus.  Where do you live?  Looks like you're cleaning a fish tank.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  It's like doing comedy behind mildew. 
[03:14:30]  Wait for a starfish to come floating by me.  Where do you live?  Jersey.  Jersey?  You don't float or swim.  I said float by me, not swim.  They don't do that either.  Ah, shut up.  It's a comedy show.  You don't have to break it down.  You said Nemo.  I should have said Nemo.  All right.  Four minutes of dead time.  You live in Jersey?  No one got that, Rich.  How old are you?  33.  How's your credit?  Very good.  Can you take a punch? 
[03:15:00]  Have you ever been with a black guy or do you get along with your father?  Never been with a black guy.  Don't get along with dad.  Have you ever had a lesbian experience?  Yes.  You have?  Yes.  In detail.  Was it in college or was it real?  It wasn't just making out.  It was real like Caligula fisting and shit?  It was real and it was after college.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  So are you a lesbo completely?  Nope.  So why don't you hook up with the...  How about this?  Here's how I'm going to close my show.  I want you to come up and fondle her fucking... 
[03:15:30]  Jane.  What's it?  What's it?  Come up and fondle Jane so I can close out strong.  It's not a big deal.  Just put your hands on it.  Just play with her tits so her fucking...  Get her in front of the window.  Just make believe you're tuning in Tokyo.  Yes.  All right.  Yes, you do.  Lift up your shirt.  All right.  Lift up your shirt.  Now I'm a fucking prop act.  All right.  There you go.  Now put your face in.  Put your face in.  Oh, there you go.  I got to make it out. 
[03:16:00]  Wow.  I'm fucking killing again.  Oh, I'm getting...  All right.  Why don't you ever put him on a piece of wood and you can hit it with a mallet and splatter  him like watermelons, Gallagher?  At least I'm not running back and forth in front of the window like Mr. Cook.  Anyhow, folks, you've been the best 17 mutants I've ever worked through.  Look at the size of this fucking guy.  Holy shit.  He's a fucking...  I wouldn't fuck with him.  Look at him.  Jesus. 
[03:16:30]  You got a girlfriend?  No.  Huh?  No, I don't.  No?  I know a girl from Jersey who's a big lesbo.  She's got big eyes.  You feel like you're fucking an owl.  Folks, you are the best.  RichVoss.com.  Amazon.  Get the DVD and see the real shit.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss.  Playing Wisecrackers in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania next weekend.  Very good, Rich.  They loved you out there in Radio Land. 
[03:17:00]  One guy writes, though,  use Lad Bag from Wack Bag.  When Voss heard I work at the Apple Store,  you could hear the wheels in his head spin  as he was figuring out whether he worked with computers  or at a fruit stand.  At a fruit stand?  The Apple Store.  Well, it's hard when you're behind the window  and it's like...  But you know what?  Dude, you killed.  Thank you.  It was a lot of fun.  This is a great crowd.  Always.  O&A.  It only took you four hours to do something for our show today, but...  No, fuck.  When I came in here...  No, and listen.  Back at Free FM, 
[03:17:30]  I had a couple lines.  I wasn't on fire,  but here's the thing.  See, Mike knows.  He heard the whole show this morning.  What?  I can tell you...  If we go over it,  I can tell you about five good lines I had  and I had a couple of days.  We'll go over it.  We'll go over it.  I'll tell them right now.  We'll give you your rating average at the end of the show.  I fucking never fail in the long run.  All right.  Hey, Butters wants to say hi from Arizona.  Oh.  Butters!  Hi, boys.  What's going on, Butters?  Not much.  I just figured I'd call back in.  Yesterday, I got sick as shit  and my aunt also died.  You got sick yesterday? 
[03:18:00]  Who died?  My grandpa.  Aw.  Now's the time to picture your grandmother.  Grieving.  Naked.  Ready to be taken advantage of.  How'd your father die?  How'd your grandfather die?  Well, I'm very sorry to hear that, brother.  Yeah, how'd he die?  Oof.  Cancer.  So, uh... 
[03:18:30]  So he's dead and...  What, you gotta go to a funeral and everything  and all that fun stuff?  Yeah, that's next week.  It sucks when you're banging him  and the coffin lid hits you in the head.  Oh, Rick.  He made it.  That's awful.  Did you love him, Butters?  Did you love him?  Yeah, I liked him a lot.  Aw.  He was my white side of the family.  He was what?  He was my white side of the family.  The white side.  What's the other?  What's the other?  Mexican.  The Mexican side.  Other things.  Mexican?  Mm-hmm.  You got any Indian in you? 
[03:19:00]  Uh, supposedly a little bit.  Yeah.  Are you gonna get the Mexicans to carry him?  Huh.  Butters, you're bringing down the show.  It's our big St. Paddy's Day party here.  Wow.  I'm sorry, guys.  But, uh, I did think of a few things to talk about.  Remember how you guys asked me, like, uh...  If you were gay?  ...and all that, that I did?  Like, we...  No.  What?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Uh, I actually, uh, have a New Year's Eve story that I wanted to tell you guys. 
[03:19:30]  A New Year's Eve story.  Now, now's the opportunity to hear one of these stories that Doug Stanhope was talking about.  All right.  He said, Butters tells these stories, and they kind of don't really go anywhere.  But we'll, we'll see.  We'll, we'll make our own opinion.  Okay, Butters, tell us the New Year's Eve story.  All right.  It was New Year's Eve.  Me and my parents and a friend of mine went up to Tucson.  Uh, we went to the Olive Garden, and previously I had hit on a waitress over there, but she 
[03:20:00]  didn't, like, respond back to me at all, so...  By waitress, you mean waiter, right?  No, waitress.  Oh, I thought you meant...  Waitress named Todd.  Waitress with a cock, right?  No.  No?  It wasn't even a female.  It was 100% female.  Okay.  And I hit on her, but, you know, it didn't go anywhere, so I got pissed off at her, so  I drew her, like, you remember how I told you I had to draw comics?  Yeah.  So I put a dog's head in the box.  I drew her blowing me.  What?  I drew her blowing me.  You drew a picture of her blowing you? 
[03:20:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Where?  On, like, the paper tablecloth or something?  Light break.  No, it was just basically just two bodies.  I didn't draw any background.  No, where did you draw it?  On, like, the tablecloth?  Yeah, it would be a good story if you drew it on her back with a knife.  I mean, wow, you drew it.  Yeah.  In your room all alone as you jerked off thinking about guys.  Right.  You showed her.  What did you draw?  No, no. 
[03:21:00]  Actually, I drew it at work.  So it wasn't even...  So she didn't see it?  Uh, no.  So if she doesn't see it, how is that getting her back in any way, shape, or form?  It's not.  It was mostly for me.  Wow, Doug is right.  Doug Stanhope's right, Butters.  You really...  You don't tell an interesting story.  You really could take the oxygen out of a room.  Well, what about the sex shop my mom took me to?  All righty.  All right.  We'll give you one more chance.  This is your last chance. 
[03:21:30]  What about the sex shop?  All right.  Well, we went to the sex shop, and it was already bad enough when my parents take me.  Oof.  And we went there, and I was looking around this stuff, and my mom yelled out all the way  through the store, Hey, son, you want the parking lot, sir?  Uh, and I just go, No!  And she also asked me if I wanted a blow-up doll, too.  Hey, us.  Right in front of my head. 
[03:22:00]  Uh, by the way, a very good observation coming in from, uh, Muffle Voice.  They're calling you, or he's calling you, uh, Mini Fez.  Mini Fez?  Yeah, Mini Fez.  Mini Fez or what, right?  You sound like...  Oh, no.  You sound like our own, uh, Fez from the Ron and Fez show.  Mini Fez.  And then there was one time Mother took me to the sex shop.  All right.  Minus the Fezitorial. 
[03:22:30]  Well, thank you, Butters.  Say hi to Doug Stanhope when you see him.  Elliot's punching out.  I will.  He said, this is boring.  Punch it out.  See you guys Monday.  Great.  Thanks, Butters.  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  How far do you travel to an Olive Garden?  Yeah, really.  Say that again?  See, we're trying to make something out of Butters for this radio show.  I don't know.  We might have to cut our losses.  But, you know, if you remember, you didn't like Pat from Munaki at the beginning.  Yeah, that's true. 
[03:23:00]  Butters might hit his stride at some point.  All right, Butters.  I doubt it.  We'll talk to you on Monday, all right?  Oh, sure.  Why not, man?  I'll think of a few more things, like a few voices.  Also, is it okay if I can bring one of my grandma's dirty books in there?  What do you mean?  Dirty books?  What's a grandma dirty book?  She reads these novels that are like romantic novels, and they're like pornographic.  All right, we've gotten some of your personal things about me over here in MySpace. 
[03:23:30]  Current mood, depressed.  Are you depressed a lot?  Uh, not as much as I used to be back then.  I don't care.  It says, as you may or may not know, I have a fucking crush on a cartoon named Sango.  Sango.  Sango?  From Inuyasha?  Inuyasha.  Inuyasha.  Yeah.  She's sexy to me because she's everything I've ever wanted in a woman.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  Two dimensions.  What, your cock?  What is, what is, what is, what is about her that, that you, you would like?  What is about her I like?  Yeah.  Well, uh, uh, I know you guys haven't watched it, but, uh, she's, it's like her voice, her  personality that she has during the show, her attitude towards stuff, and, uh, it's, it's  just everything that she does in the show, it's really hard to explain.  That's, so you're in love with the cock.  But that's the only anime. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, but that's the only one.  All right, wait a minute.  Uh, it says you masturbate every day, like most men.  I'm just admitting it here, sometimes more than three times a day.  Holy Jesus.  This is when I get bored, though.  My record is 12 times in one day.  It's much.  I had better things to do.  I can beat it if I try and get, uh, the time.  You can beat 12.  What do you, what do you, uh, you beat off to magazines or comic books or fantasize in  your head?  What do you, what do you use? 
[03:25:00]  Jesus, what are you shooting?  Brain cells?  No.  Not at all.  Uh, uh, just, really just jerk off and, you know, maybe think of Hongo or something else.  Think of a cartoon while you're jerking off.  Oh, all right.  Oh, I know.  Oh, that's why they made hentai.  Oh, my God.  You ever jerk off to baseball cards?  All right.  Uh, well, go to your grandpa's funeral, will ya? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I will.  We'll talk about your wacky hat collection and, and, and you, wait, if you should ever  hang out with me, don't expect anything much other than weird ass shenanigans and crappy  yet somehow amusing sayings.  Do you got an amusing saying you can leave us with?  Uh, yes.  Uh, actually, my grandpa Dunlap, uh, left me with a, uh, stupid little thong, if you guys  want to hear it.  Well, you know what your grandfather's last words were?  Yes, he's my grandson.  No, his last words. 
[03:26:00]  You get the idea of where I was going with that, if I just had a funny joke?  Crying.  Your grandfather, your grandfather's last words were, he's what?  No, no, no, this is a, this is, this is another grandpa.  All right.  How many do you have?  I had three, but now I have one.  Well, he is Mexican.  All right.  Well, give us your song or whatever you were going to do for us. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  Uh, it's called, in the days of old, when knights were bold, before rubbers were invented, they  wrapped a sock around their cock and felt quite contented.  I think if, if you go into the garage, you'll see your father hanging right now.  Dad, I'll be right with you.  One dead, two to go.  You, uh, you like going to, like, the grocery store in full renaissance attire to watch people 
[03:27:00]  stare at you?  That's kind of funny.  Sometimes.  Yeah?  All right, well.  Yeah, it's fun.  You know, it's mostly just hippies that live in this town, so they really don't care, but  sometimes I'll get lucky enough to get a tourist, and, uh, they'll just look at me strangely.  Anyone else getting, well.  Anyone else getting lightheaded?  A little bit.  Yeah.  I wonder if there's a barbecue lit somewhere.  I'm losing the oxygen.  All right, Butters, we've got to let you go.  We tried.  No problem, man.  We tried.  We're not really, we're not sure what to do with you yet.  I think Butters has potential somewhere, but can't quite figure it out. 
[03:27:30]  Uh, there's a guy named Dave from New York on the Instant Feedback.  There's a guy in your studio who could sing Death Rockapella.  What?  Oh, my God.  Is it you?  That's Rockapella?  The dude that was talking to him?  Oh, no.  Hold on.  This guy says on Instant Feedback, it's the greatest thing you'll ever hear.  Please call him out.  Please.  You will thank me.  That's the guy that was talking to himself.  That's the guy.  Did you see the movie Dirty Harry when he took the bus? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Of kids?  Yeah.  That's him.  I can't stand.  What is this Rockapella thing all about?  What's your name?  All right.  My name's Todd.  Hi.  Hi.  Todd.  Todd.  Todd.  Todd.  I'm in that street.  Where was your land?  This morning.  Anyway.  I.  Oh, God.  All right.  Yeah.  Basically.  Yeah.  I can do different.  I do rock a, a cappella versions of heavy metal tunes.  Ah.  Okay.  So, like what? 
[03:28:30]  What kind of.  Like what song can you do that's popular so we're, we're all in on the bit?  Um.  Let's first.  Um.  I could do like Enter Sandman or something.  All right.  You guys want to hear this or what?  Yeah.  Metallica.  Sit down, Richard Jesus.  No.  Supposedly it's the greatest thing we'll ever hear.  We got to, we got to give it a shot.  Actually, I could do Painkiller by Judas Priest if you want to hear that one.  Well, Enter Sandman, which one you want to do?  I don't care.  I don't know any of them. 
[03:29:00]  Huh?  Enter Sandman?  All right.  Enter Sandman?  Yeah.  Do you need anything special for this?  Uh, nope.  Music.  Drum beat.  Are you going to be shy if you're looking at the crowd because you could just look at us?  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Tell me who's in it.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Say it, please, little one.  Don't forget my son.  Doing good, everyone.  I'll tuck you in. 
[03:29:30]  What a weird thing.  Team you think I'm a sin.  Tell this Sandman he comes.  Did you see yourself?  See where the world I open.  Keep it open tight.  Exit light.  Answer night.  Take my hand.  We're off to never, never, that end.  Did you shit yourself? 
[03:30:00]  Someone yelled out.  Butter just killed himself.  Thank you.  Hey, that's all right.  Wow.  Wow.  He turns like fucking purple.  Yeah.  He turns totally purple when he does that.  You have another one that's your fave?  Uh, probably Painkiller by Judas Priest.  All right, I'll go Painkiller to end it.  When he sings this, he looks like a fucking porn star wearing a cock ring. 
[03:30:30]  I know.  Just turns fucking purple.  All right.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do 
[03:31:00]  He is the Baykill, and this is the Baykill.  I'm going to finish the fun-headed crushes out there.  Oh, my God.  They all pulled their shirts up over their heads like Beavis.  The guy is fucking Beavis come to life. 
[03:31:30]  Holy shit, dude.  That's all right, man.  You're right.  He's fucking Beavis.  He's very nerdy looking, too, just to get the visual out there and radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How much do you weigh?  Like 125 pounds, 130 pounds tops?  Yeah, pretty much.  You're a dumbass.  Get up, butthole.  That's all right, man.  Anyone else with a talent out there they want to show off today?  Anybody else?  Someone said, oh, my God, like they got something. 
[03:32:00]  Any other talents out there?  Got to be in that room.  That we need to know of.  I bring nothing to the table.  Huh?  I bring nothing to the table.  He's being honest.  Give Erox line.  No one else?  I'd rather shave Spork and Patty's head today.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I just might have to.  Let's see.  No.  No.  No.  No.  She goes into panic mode.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, God.  No, no.  She puts that worried look on her face.  You just want to hit her with a hatchet. 
[03:32:30]  It's getting hot in here.  No.  Don't worry so much, Patty.  And H-Cup, we're going to do a bukkake thing with your boobs, right?  The booboo cocky today?  I thought we were doing the booby lantern.  What happened?  We can do both.  Well, that's the booby lantern.  Well, can we make it really dark out there so we can do the booby lantern before break?  Let's do the booby lantern.  Well, no.  That's the warm-up chart.  Booby.  What do you mean I was bombing on the way here in the car?  What are you talking about?  What happened? 
[03:33:00]  Didn't you say he called in?  Oh, Mikey?  Yeah.  I'm sitting right next to you.  He was in the studio the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you were there the whole time.  Oh, my God.  They shut the lights off outside.  Someone's going to get robbed.  All right.  Turn off the lights in here.  Oh.  Let's all fucking rape Patty.  By let's, I mean everyone but me.  All right.  Now we're in the pitch dark.  This is just for the visual for the crowd out there.  Watch out for that half a black fan. 
[03:33:30]  We learned a long time ago.  Girls with Preston plans should throw a little flashlight under them  and the whole thing lights up like a lantern.  You need a pretty strong flashlight.  Turn off all the lights in the offices and all that.  Have her stand in that tub of water.  Well, if you use a flash, the picture isn't going to come out.  You're not going to get a photo up.  Yeah, yeah, dummy.  Fucking guys using a flash.  Can we do the shades or?  Please.  There is no flash photography during the boobo lantern phase of the show. 
[03:34:00]  Thank you.  Now she's standing out there waiting for a flashlight.  Is that what we're waiting on?  Yes.  Oh, we should have had one by now.  Do some stand-up light.  Yeah, that's...  Now we're trying to plug in a light because none of the lights are on.  Ah.  But is it a light like a flashlight because it's got to be under her boob and kind of block?  Yeah.  None of the light can...  I don't know if that's going to work.  I don't know if that'll work.  Her tits are so big.  Her shirt looks like boobo.  No, it's got to seal the light around it like a regular flashlight. 
[03:34:30]  You got any regular flashlights?  Yeah, just stick the flashlight.  Yeah, yeah.  Put that under her tit.  On it.  On it.  No, it's got to be on it.  On it.  Underneath.  Underneath.  Right there.  Now touch it.  There it is.  Oh, Jesus.  How scary is that?  Look at that.  That looks like an eye in a fucking medical lab.  That's cool, huh?  They're trying to take pictures of it.  You got to seal off the light and it lights up like a freaking lantern.  Oh, look at the veins.  Isn't that cool?  Isn't that creepy?  There you go, guys. 
[03:35:00]  There's one for the studio audience today.  It looks like the crawling eye.  It is like the crawling eye.  Wow.  Is that wild?  It ain't going to work with the flash, you dumb fucks.  No flash photography.  You got to take it without the flash.  No flash.  Wow, look at that.  How weird is that?  Look at the fucking...  It looks radioactive.  You can see James through it.  It looks like, you know, dry red boobs.  Dry clear boobs. 
[03:35:30]  Hey, that's all right.  All right, there you go.  There's your booby landing.  That's for the studio audience.  Anyone at home, if you know a girl with implants, just take a flashlight, put it right up against  the bottom of her boob and they light up.  Beautiful.  All right, we're going to take a break.  My Generation with Stalker Patty.  The tape has been handed in, finally.  We got her talking in between songs, so they're quick little clips.  Yeah, good.  Her talking about the music, so we'll do that next.  Stay there.  That was good.  In a starchy world that's mired in imperfection.  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place, they put it like on the grill. 
[03:36:00]  One man.  It's all about me, me, me.  No challenge.  The status quo.  They don't have a toaster?  That annoys me.  Navigating treacherous terrain.  There's crap all over it.  Like I'm seeing grease.  Confronting the unknown.  And there's something green on it, which could be a pepper or a booger.  It's awful.  With a platoon of interns.  You sheep.  And military precision.  Go, go, go.  Fix it.  The world will witness a revolution. 
[03:36:30]  Bagel diva.  Coming soon.  Come on.  To a bakery near you.  Are you kidding?  Hey, the Opie and Anthony Show loves women.  And to show our support for females and all the joy they bring to our lives, we've developed  the Money Snatch.  The Money Snatch is an opportunity for those less fortunate ladies to make a little extra  money.  And to have a lot of fun doing it.  The Opie and Anthony Show wants to take a group of young ladies, put them in a room full  of money, and whatever they can hold on to, they get to keep. 
[03:37:00]  And there's no cash.  Seriously.  No catch.  Details on OpieAndAnthony.com  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:37:30]  We have a very festive crowd outside the studio.  They did the walkover today.  They're enjoying the food from Ricolli's and from River.  They got the Wow Me I'm Irish t-shirts my brother made.  If you want one, if you're not going to join us at FH Riley's tomorrow night, you can go  to MyRadioStore.com to get them.  It's so odd.  I'm getting, I'm watching them on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  They're right there out the window.  But you'd rather watch them on Pal Talk.  I'd rather watch them.  It's almost like watching, you know in Scarface when Tony Montana, his security cameras and 
[03:38:00]  all the Colombians are coming over the wall?  That's what it seems like to me.  If you're watching on TV, it doesn't look as dangerous.  It doesn't look like they're as close.  Yeah.  It doesn't look like they're as close.  But there's some guys out there.  I'm just so glad they're on our side.  Oh, how fucking tall is that?  How tall are you?  Seven foot?  And on the other side of the wall.  That's only 6'7"?  I know, I know.  But I'm taller.  I'm wearing heels.  He looks a lot taller in person.  Yeah.  And this is our lives. 
[03:38:30]  We're trying to stall because they had to run out and get stuff to make fake jizz.  Fake jizz concoction.  Yes.  Casey.  It's right here in the middle of the pastry.  Well, yeah.  We could have used that.  Why use fake?  All right.  What else?  Enough guys here.  Stalker Patty in studio.  Oh, just a quickie.  Hold the flowers.  Sinbad's alive.  What?  Did you hear about this?  Someone last night said there was a rumor that he was dead.  Condolences poured in for comedian Sinbad after the online encyclopedia Wikpedia announced 
[03:39:00]  his death yesterday, but it turned out the grieving was premature and the comic is alive.  And no one cares.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  But you can't trust that Wikipedia for now.  People just go in there and make up their own shit.  All right.  You guys want to hear a taste of Stalker Patty's My Generation show?  No!  All right.  I heard yes.  By the way, during that break, we played the new promo for the Money Snatch game we're 
[03:39:30]  going to play eventually.  And then Stalker Patty, as we're coming back from break, goes, I was thinking of doing  the Money Snatch.  Patty, grab the microphone.  And then we all started just dry heaving right in front of us.  Now, Patty, you would do the Money Snatch?  I try.  You know what the Money Snatch is, right?  Yeah, I know.  Can you describe it, please?  Well, hopefully we'll use the condom and you put it up in your intimate areas and the  money's got to go in there.  We're not on a free FM. 
[03:40:00]  You put it up in the condom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  She doesn't have that.  You put the money in your hoo-hoo coochie, and you've got to carry it around for them.  Sit down.  Pop that coochie.  You know, Anthony, I was thinking.  Yeah.  You know, like we like to try things out in the O&A lab.  At the Institute.  At the O&A Institute.  I see a lot of guys out there that might or might not have a few dollars on them.  A few bucks.  And...  Stalker Patty, turn around and look at all that cold, hard cash staring at you. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, one guy's holding up a fucking price.  Look at the half block I held up a food stamp.  Patty.  Patty, I'm just thinking, you know, you haven't really done anything exciting for our radio  show in a long time, but man, you'll do great radio for Ron and Fez whenever you can, right?  Yeah.  I'm not there that much. 
[03:41:00]  How about we rope off the animals, we throw some cash down, and we see what you can do in  a minute's time.  A minute.  You pick up as much money as you can.  I'll throw some on the floor, too.  I came with a little bit.  And you know what?  We could use a mask or a paper bag.  So no one knows it's you, except for the people here.  And we have...  Do we have...  What are they called?  The things that roll on?  You want condoms?  Condoms.  Condoms.  Yeah, we have a condom. 
[03:41:30]  So you want to take that and roll it over the money, and then you got to, you know...  You get...  You could get enough money to buy your teeth extensions.  Oh, good.  Little chicklets.  Well, do you think you could do that?  Now, you're a 51-year-old virgin.  So now, how thick of a wad of cash do you think you're going to get in there?  Not very.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It just seems like something...  Have you used a dildo before on yourself at all? 
[03:42:00]  Patty's a dirty girl.  Let's be honest.  Yeah, she's dirty.  She's supposed to be in, like...  She's just dirty with herself, though, now.  You got vibrators at home, right?  I got one.  You got one.  I got it as a gift.  How many times do you use it?  Do you use it weekly at this point?  I want to know about you.  How often?  Well, I have to admit it.  I have tried it a few times.  How many times a week would you say you use it?  Well, we busted her cherry, man.  And since then, I think she's doing it a lot.  Patty, how often would you say you use the dildo? 
[03:42:30]  Her cherry was green.  I don't know.  When I...  If I can't sleep and I need to relax, it helps.  Ah.  I need to sleep, jerk.  I think the guys can relate to that.  A little sleep, so...  Do you lay there and, like, do you orgasm?  I'm not sure what that feels like.  It just relaxes me, but I'm embarrassed.  No, don't be embarrassed, Patty.  I just want to know, do you shake a little bit? 
[03:43:00]  Do you, like, feel a release of energy of sorts?  Is that kind of how it feels?  I want to tell you I can't do it that long.  You can't do it that long?  Why?  No, because I can't.  Can you do one for us today?  Because you can't what?  We got a vibrator in the joint?  Go look into this.  Look in the sex closet.  See if we got a vibrator in there.  Oh, wait, you come too quickly?  I don't know how to put it. 
[03:43:30]  I'm so embarrassed.  Is that why that comes?  So she, like, puts the vibrator on, and she comes immediately and then goes to sleep.  You're a man.  Yeah.  I don't know what you call it.  How do you get that cut on your lip?  When you were done there, you just rammed a vibrator in this?  No.  Any batteries?  No.  We have batteries in the house!  Under the table.  Under the table.  Fucking here and her.  Yeah.  No, she doesn't shove it in.  I don't do that.  See? 
[03:44:00]  She just kind of knocks on the door a little bit.  Knocks on the door.  Keep it on the outside.  I don't believe it.  That's a brand new vibrator.  Yeah.  It's still in the package.  We just need a battery.  Is that like one you have?  Mine's yellow and...  Oh, it is?  Old-fashioned one.  Old-fashioned?  Made of ivory?  Do you have a name for it?  No.  It started off brown, but that dry pussy turned it yellow.  Oh, no.  It's a color. 
[03:44:30]  Yellow.  It turned it...  A yellow one?  Oh, my.  Who wants to see Stalker Patty masturbate?  Woo!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  H-Cup J might be off the hook.  Jesus.  H-Cup might be off the hook.  We got batteries.  Here are some batteries.  It takes double A's.  Have H-Cup masturbator.  Now screw it on there.  There we go.  Fill that, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Oh!  Patty, take your jeans off. 
[03:45:00]  Take your jeans off.  Turn the lights off, because I don't want to...  Yeah, get the lights dim there.  And someone go off...  Hey, Thad.  Get someone to count how much money we got up for grabs for a quick money snap game with  Patty.  All right.  You might walk away with some bills paid.  Take one for the team.  I got a dollar.  Ah.  Ah, one for the team.  Take one for the team.  That's what that fucking woman that went to the lacrosse team's party said.  I got a dollar.  That's all I got.  Look at us collecting money from our listeners. 
[03:45:30]  I mean, we're going to throw money in, too.  Jesus.  Can I keep my underpants on?  Yeah.  Trust me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't want that stuff falling on in the studio.  Well, Patty, have you been able to do that with your underpants on?  Well, yeah.  Oh, I thought you touched it.  That's how sensitive I am.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  What happened?  I have to look at her underwear?  Why?  Oh, God.  Ew.  What are you...  Ew.  That's usually really sexy. 
[03:46:00]  Here, stand up and show the...  She looks like an old-time wrestler getting ready for a match.  Look at her back.  It's all puffed out like a diaper.  How do you go old school?  She looks like Bruno Sammartino getting ready to get in the ring.  You know what's sad?  I remember him when he was fighting.  That's what's sad.  You look like Ivan Putzky.  The Polish Hammer.  Thank you. 
[03:46:30]  I love you, too.  All right.  Here you go.  Your legs look like...  I'll contribute a 20.  I got a 10.  There you go.  I'm going to give...  I'm going to give...  Your legs look like rice pudding.  Oh, get that smell!  All right.  Listen, Patty, start with your orgasm.  Yep.  It usually goes pretty quickly.  See, she's learned.  Because we had a teacher how to do this back, I don't know, a year ago.  And now it's obvious she knows what she's doing.  Now, here's what we got to do.  The people out there, I know you're very excited.  You want to yell and hoot and holler.  So, let's try to be quiet, and Patty, shut your eyes, or just relax, lean back, and use 
[03:47:00]  that like you do at home, and we'll see what happens.  Okay?  Sound good?  All right.  All right.  Well, anytime you're ready.  All right.  You want to get the lights off in here?  There it is.  Yeah.  Shut the lights off.  In here.  All right.  Just close your eyes and do what you have to do, Patty.  Make believe...  No.  Let me shut that one off.  Make believe it's just you and Anthony.  Shut up.  Oh, God, no.  I'm going to be alone in the privacy of my room. 
[03:47:30]  Right.  There you go.  It's from two countries.  All right.  Just relax.  There you go.  All right.  You've got to close your eyes.  Lean back.  Come on.  I don't think nobody wants to see that.  No, they do.  No, they do.  They just can't.  Oh, God.  Can I stop now?  No.  Keep going. 
[03:48:00]  Keep going.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Stop.  Just don't talk.  Just keep going.  No.  Just close your eyes.  I keep...  I keep...  Oh, my God.  See?  Just keep going.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Come on.  I want you to stop.  Don't.  Don't laugh.  Don't laugh.  Just keep going.  Shh.  Shh.  Oh, my God.  I want to stop.  Stop.  I actually don't go this... 
[03:48:30]  What?  Oh, please.  Oh, please.  I can't feel it.  I can't.  I'm a nice girl.  Come on, please.  Because I keep ruining the breeze.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Hattie.  Hattie.  Hattie.  Hattie.  Hattie.  Hattie.  Hattie.  Keep it there.  Keep it there.  Put it in your pants.  Put it in your underwear.  Why?  Just put it in.  I've never done that.  I need that. 
[03:49:00]  I need a firm idea.  Put it in the underwear.  Oh, I've never done that.  It's a whole other ball game.  Listen to me.  Touch the doorknob.  Let's go.  Yeah, you know where to touch.  Put it in the underwear.  Just do that and keep it there.  And relax and shut your eyes and just don't think.  Oh, no.  Why?  Why am I doing this?  Don't think so much.  Just think of air time.  Oh, my God.  No, wait.  This is too much now.  I've got to stop.  I've got to stop.  It's too much. 
[03:49:30]  I can't handle this.  Don't.  I've never done it this long before.  I can't.  When you do it at home, do you have an orgasm?  All I know is that I can't stand it after a few minutes and I've got to stop.  Because she's a good girl.  You build up to a point where you're going to fucking orgasm and then you just stop.  Because you feel all guilty.  Yeah, all right.  We're not even here.  Just go.  Oh, my God. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Does it feel good?  You're a bad girl.  I'm embarrassed.  I can't.  Just move it around there.  Why did you pull that away so fast?  Don't wash that off.  Why did you pull that away so fast?  I don't want to say why.  Oh, my God.  She's just ready to go.  You're ready to go.  Will you just go?  Patty, would you just go?  Do that until you're done. 
[03:50:30]  We're not going to let you stop until you finish.  Just finish.  Just finish.  Don't you pull that away.  Don't you pull that away.  Don't you pull that away.  We shook your head.  God damn, Patty.  Don't you.  Just keep going.  Don't stop.  Don't pull that away.  Don't pull it away. 
[03:51:00]  I can't.  I can't.  She's shaking like crazy.  I can't help it.  Leave it there.  Why do I go to the torch?  Just leave it there.  Move it around a little like you were before.  She looks like she has Parkinson's.  I can't help it.  I'm shaking.  You see her shaking all over the place?  I can't help it.  She's having a seizure.  I can't even make me cry.  Don't move it.  And don't wipe off the vibrator when you're done. 
[03:51:30]  Would you stop laughing and just.  I can't.  I'm going to cry.  Don't worry.  You're dead relatives in heaven are looking at you.  I can't.  I can't.  Keep it down there.  That's her stopping.  Keep it down there.  Keep it down there. 
[03:52:00]  Why?  Press it up against there.  I'm doing this.  What are you fucking trigger?  I can't help it.  Counting?  I'm just sensitive.  That's all.  I can't help it.  It's a reaction.  Picture your grandmother naked.  To get the thought of Patty masturbating.  That's Chester's liver from Whack Bag.  All right.  Back to Patty.  Fuck Chester's liver.  There you go, Patty.  There it is.  Why are you doing it? 
[03:52:30]  Throw that stuff in.  I can't.  This is torture.  Torture.  Yeah, she does.  She sounds like she's raping herself.  She's keeping me from...  I can't help it.  I can't help it.  Stop.  She's making me...  Keep going.  She's making me keep my...  Stop.  It's just a reaction.  It's come.  Go show her.  Why is she moving like that?  I don't know. 
[03:53:00]  Because I...  Her head is going like...  She's going to make you keep it there.  Because I'm not used to the feeling.  Of what?  I can't talk about it.  The feeling of what?  Chris from Oklahoma City.  Chris from Oklahoma City.  I never thought someone could rape themselves.  I'm actually making...  Come on.  Get the orgasm done.  Let's go. 
[03:53:30]  Ew.  She's having an asthma attack.  What the hell are you doing?  Come on, please.  Please.  Talk down into yourself.  I'm getting exhausted.  Oh, great.  She's going to die having an orgasm on her show.  Wonderful.  All right.  I'm getting tired.  All right.  Take the goddamn thing away.  Don't wipe it off.  Don't wipe it off.  Why?  We'll pay...  We'll pay...  Or give to somebody from the studio or a guy something.  If he kind of swallows that.  Ew.  Come on.  Come on.  One of these guys is going to swallow it.  Boy, Rich.  You couldn't wait to say that. 
[03:54:00]  I know.  That's the content.  Come on.  I can't move.  You know that?  He's going to take it.  Caroline.  Right here.  Look at him.  He's going to take it.  What's your name?  I'll fucking do it for ONA Glory.  Hold on.  We're done with you.  This is for ONA Glory.  ONA Glory.  All right.  What's your name?  Alex.  Alex, where are you from?  I live out in Astoria.  All right.  Let's go, Alex.  Alex is taking the dildo that Patty just used.  I got it.  I got it.  And in his mouth, the whole thing.  Oh, wow. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, he's deep-throating it.  Oh, he's sucking on that dildo.  How does Patty take there, buddy?  Wow.  It's a little salty.  A little tangy.  Oh, God damn.  I know it's a bad thing.  I can't move.  Oh, Jesus.  Are you supposed to be paralyzed temporarily?  What?  You can't move?  Yeah, I can hardly move.  Definitely need to drink water. 
[03:55:00]  Why?  I can hardly move.  You can hardly move.  This guy just ate fucking Charlotte's Web just now.  But more importantly, Patty can't move.  She's paralyzed.  Yeah, Patty, what happened?  I don't know.  It just numbs you.  It numbs you.  It numbs you.  You know, you passed the point where you could have sex.  Am I turning white?  No.  I thought I was for a second.  That's a team player right there.  You're a mess, Patty.  I'm sorry. 
[03:55:30]  Did you have an orgasm?  Did you cum?  I don't know if I did or not.  All I know is that I'm paralyzed.  Do you feel guilty right now?  Yes, I do.  You can.  I feel weird.  She started rocking, like, back and forth.  I never get to this point where I can't move for a second.  Can you move yet?  Well, my arms feel heavy for some reason.  Oh, yeah?  But is that normal?  I think she had an orgasm.  Yeah, I think you've got an orgasm.  Patty, we got $118.  Wow.  But you have to do money snatch. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Add more to it.  God damn it.  But are you going to be able to move?  Well, now you have $120.  Let's see what I can do.  I guess I'm moist enough.  Oh.  Wow.  Did you get a little wet down there, Patty?  All right.  Did we...  Now I feel it.  You feel like you're wet?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Well, now I do. 
[03:56:30]  I didn't feel anything the first couple of minutes.  Yeah, but now it's like, what is it, all wet in your panties?  I don't know.  I guess...  I'm embarrassed.  All right.  Listen, Patty.  Holy shit.  Can we rope off the area for a quick game of money snatch?  She fucking came and turned into Christopher Reeve.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  I can't help it.  Are you supposed to get numb?  I guess that's part of it for you.  Coke Logic is having a great day on Instant Feedback from Whackbag.  Ha ha. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, day glory.  Someone skull fucked a dead monkey and no one remembers his name.  Ha ha.  Oh, classic line.  Holy shit.  Fuck you, Coke Logic.  He's on fire today.  All right.  They're clearing the field for a quick game of money snatch to end the Opie and Anthony  show today.  Patty, you got to be completely naked.  Do you want a mask?  Yeah, I should get one.  You want a paper bag would be good for you.  Yeah, probably. 
[03:57:30]  Paper bag.  I'm a vibe bagger.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  I'll be completely honest with you.  That's the first time she has made me really laugh.  That's funny.  I'm a five bagger.  I know it.  I'm a five bagger.  You're truly not ugly.  You're not ugly.  Jimmy likes your ass.  You got to just.  Well, that's because I take care of myself.  I don't overeat or anything like that.  All right.  Make sure we cut some holes in the bag so it doesn't fucking suffocate. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, well.  What bag do we got?  Use a plastic one.  A rubber band.  A little space helmet.  Yeah.  Let me say I'm Rob on New Orleans.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, Rob.  Are you.  Did you suggest the amputee thing this morning?  No, no.  This is my first call today.  I just can't believe it's screwing the retard.  It could be so hot.  It was kind of weird because it sounded like we were doing it to her.  She was doing it to herself going, no, stop.  I can't do this. 
[03:58:30]  And I'm like, but no one's touching you.  It's hard doing it.  It was only you.  She was like that one guy said.  She was raping herself.  What the fuck?  No, I enjoy the hell of it.  Patty might have got line of the day with I'm a five-bagger, by the way.  I just want to acknowledge that.  I'm a five-bagger.  All right, Rob.  Thank you.  You got to cut holes in it.  What bag is going to fit on her head?  Oh, and they made the bukkake.  Oh, good.  You need a bigger bag, E-Rock.  Who for?  Wait, who opens for who? 
[03:59:00]  Patty, why are the bags under the ice?  You working too hard?  Staying up masturbating?  Staying up just surfing the net for porn?  What's going on with you?  I don't know.  I must be beginning my changes.  Now I'm starting to feel hot and cold and I'm not sleeping well at night.  That's just part of your body dying.  No, it doesn't mean that at all.  In fact, women past that age say they have better sex than they did in the 20s.  Oh, stop it.  You have nothing to compare it to. 
[03:59:30]  We just got a tray of homemade bukkake.  Yeah, that's a bigger bag.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah, that's it.  All right, Patty, mark out where some holes are.  Get some big eye holes in there.  Yeah, cut some fucking eye holes.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice.  Big fucking dagger.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, Patty, you are something else.  I'm a piece of cake.  What?  Yeah.  I'll touch a card. 
[04:00:00]  You want to squeeze H-Cup Jane's boobs beforehand?  Squeeze them?  Yeah.  Squeeze them.  Yeah.  Patty, do you like girls?  No, I don't go that way.  You don't go any way?  You haven't been with a guy?  No.  Not even when you were like a teen growing up?  Did you go to your prom?  Yeah.  Did you kiss anybody?  You know, I never went to my prom.  Surprise, surprise.  Because I didn't have the money to go to it. 
[04:00:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Carrie.  I know.  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Get in your closet and pray with me.  Pray with me, Carrie.  Let's go to Steve in Canada.  Steve.  Oh, I can really...  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Hey, not too much.  I just listened to your show.  We need a visual here.  What's this body look like?  Oh, God.  I thought everyone knew by now.  Have you ever had a cup of rice pudding?  Oh, man.  Wait, Steve, she's 51 years old. 
[04:01:00]  She's a virgin.  If that doesn't say it all, she's not fat or anything.  But gravity's taking over a bit here and there.  You know what?  I'll give you the perfect image.  You ever seen that actress Scarlett Johansson?  Think of the absolute opposite of that.  How about just...  Hey, I got one because he's from Canada.  You ever seen Rush in concert?  Oh, right.  Okay.  You know Rush.  I'm not Geddy Lee with tits.  I swear to God.  No, Geddy Lee has bigger tits. 
[04:01:30]  I swear to God.  Patty and Geddy Lee, definitely one of those separated at birth things.  Her body looks like...  Did you ever see the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark when the guy's face melted?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  You guys are out of control.  Let's just put it this way.  At this point, we're making her look like the elephant man.  Yeah.  And that's an improvement.  A paper bag over her head.  Oh, man.  I'll tell you what, guys.  Your show is awesome.  You guys are on in Fez.  I can barely keep my van on the road during the day, man.  Oh, thank you, sir.  How are you going to get your shirt off, Patty? 
[04:02:00]  I will.  You want us to just rip off the shirt?  Not rip, but walk.  Let's take it off.  Okay.  As usual, I don't wear a bra because I have nothing there.  Yeah.  Then why don't you wear a hat?  Put me next to H-Cup.  You won't see me at wall.  Why did you?  Hey, I'm triple A.  I didn't hear you.  I'm pressing myself.  All right.  Here we go.  Patty's getting naked, everybody.  We have nothing there.  Brain's joke.  Triple A.  Triple A Cup.  I wasn't born with anything.  They look bigger, though. 
[04:02:30]  They're just kind of...  Maybe that's part of it.  No, over the years, they're kind of going a little south.  That's all.  Look at his face.  I could just, like, shoot on a lemon or something.  I'm telling you.  It almost makes you say, you know what?  Cock doesn't look that bad.  Thank you.  I love you, too.  She's covering up now.  No, she don't look bad.  Don't cover up.  It doesn't matter.  People are looking away on their own.  That's all right.  People have seen two eggs in a skillet before.  Right.  Look at those fucking raisins. 
[04:03:00]  They look fuller.  Are you pregnant or something?  No, I'm not.  It could be my team.  She's pregnant.  Fucking look out.  If I am, it would be the Immaculate Conception.  You'd have to call the Daily News.  It would be second in history.  That would be the biggest media outlet we would go to.  God has impregnated a woman with his seed.  Is this the Daily News?  Can I get this on page six?  Hello, Bensonhurst High newspaper. 
[04:03:30]  All right, we're getting the paper bag back on our head.  Yeah, I may as well.  Money Snatch.  What do we do?  Give her a minute?  Don't forget you had a meeting with Bud after the show.  They know it has to be short.  What?  Fuck.  What?  I got a train to catch.  Oh, fuck me.  What's this meeting about?  And I love Bud, but come on.  Here?  I guess.  About anything important?  Hey, Poe.  You've got to tie it a little lower. 
[04:04:00]  Can one of these guys bring me a coffee with milk and sweet milk?  Oh, I thought you meant a guy named Bud.  Let's go out there and get this over with.  Do I get a microphone?  Yes.  Do you hear me?  Am I on?  I'm going to go out.  I just come in no fucking hurry.  That's for sure.  I've got to take the...  You've got to take your jeans off because you're doing my snatch.  The object is...  Wait, I need a headphone so I can hear it. 
[04:04:30]  The object of this game, as you know, Patty, is you have a minute to pick up as much cash  as possible, roll it up, and insert it into your vagina.  What about the condom or something?  Yeah, well, you've got to roll it up, put a condom on it, and then put it inside your vagina.  And then whatever you have inside your vag at that time, you get to keep. 
[04:05:00]  So now you've got to remember this also, Patty.  If you have the money in your hand after a minute, you don't get anything.  You've got to pick up the money and allot yourself enough time to roll it up, put it in the condom, and shove it up your snatch.  You're going to keep your socks on.  I can?  No, you can.  Stay warm.  Patty's got an ass a black guy would like.  Like, it's like sticking out, but so is the front. 
[04:05:30]  I've never seen a 51-year-old virgin have a cesarean scar before.  That's my appendix scar.  Oh, all right.  Even they wanted to get out of here.  It's like a C-section scar, though.  I know, you've got to crawl out into the money snatch field.  Yeah.  We'll walk the money out.  You're going to have a...  All right, hold on.  There she goes.  All right, who's got the stopwatch?  Come on, Dan.  I got it.  By the way, by the way...  Not good, Patty. 
[04:06:00]  Relax.  Let's go.  All right, ladies and gentlemen.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  Let's hear it for Starker Patty as she does the money snatch.  All right, start crawling.  To applause, applause, applause.  Or boos.  And she's crawling out onto the field.  Wow.  There's something very wrong about this.  This old gag.  Go ahead.  We're not doing anything.  Get out there.  She drops off. 
[04:06:30]  She drops off.  Can someone call her like a dog?  She has nowhere to go.  There you go.  All right, there you go.  Here, girl.  Here, girl.  Here, girl.  Here, girl.  Oh, my God.  She's crawling on all fours.  She's got a paper bag on her head.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, there you go.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah, why don't you...  All right, Patty, you ready?  Yeah, but where's the condom?  Here you go.  Here's your condom.  Dan's got the money.  Dan, you got to throw it all over the place.  All right, I'll start doing it.  You got one minute. 
[04:07:00]  Hold on.  Let Dan throw the money around first.  All right, Dan's distributing the money all over the floor.  And Patty, remember, has a minute to pick it up.  Roll it up.  Put it in a condom.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  She can't pay attention.  Let's see.  Oh, Dan's strategically placing some of the larger bills around.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Well, there's no... 
[04:07:30]  Patty.  Yeah?  We don't want you getting any diseases.  There might be, like, fleas on the floor, so we're going to just, you know, lay down a tarp real fast.  Oh, all right.  Why don't you stand up so you don't touch the fleas?  I don't know any of them.  Yeah, they're doing construction in here, as you see, and there's, like, insulation on the floor.  Well, don't throw the money down, then.  Jesus Christ.  Anthony, don't turn around. 
[04:08:00]  All right, lickety-split.  All right.  Thank you.  Patty, don't sit on anything.  Yeah, just stand there.  Just stand there awkwardly.  Just be naked.  Just be naked.  Jesus Christ.  God damn, Lopi.  I have never...  Yeah, fix her bag, E-Rock.  Her bag is coming off her head. 
[04:08:30]  No tarp?  It's coming.  Why is this taking so long?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  All right there, Patty.  You want to fix the rubber band?  You all right?  All right.  We have the tarp coming.  Hey, Patty, did that feel good or bad with the vibrator?  It felt different than what I usually do.  Different than what you usually do.  Yeah.  I never do it that long.  It's too long.  It's too long because you finally had an orgasm. 
[04:09:00]  You don't do it up to the point where you have an orgasm at home.  See, you got to do it that long.  Didn't it feel good?  No?  It just felt weird.  It felt weird.  It made me feel kind of dirty.  Body-wise, too.  Jesus, man.  I'm freezing.  Where the hell did they fucking store this thing?  Well, it had to be made. 
[04:09:30]  Oh, we're making a tarp.  It's taking a couple of hours.  Well, Patty, we want to keep you safe, you know?  We don't know what's on this floor.  It has insulation.  Insulation from above.  That shit makes you itch.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now, guys, look at this crew.  Look at this crew work.  Let's hear it for the O&A crew.  This is the grounds crew for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, it's like the grounds crew that comes out when it rains at the ball game.  There they are. 
[04:10:00]  The retarded pit crew.  All right.  Very good.  Ah, they're going to put a new rug in here anyway.  Yeah.  True.  That's true.  Don't want it to stink, though.  The whole fucking six months.  All right.  They're going to tape it down real fast.  Jesus.  All right.  No.  What?  Money's going to go over it.  What happened?  She thought the money was under it.  No, Patty.  Why would we do that?  You would suffocate that way. 
[04:10:30]  All right.  Again.  Yeah, just tape it up nice and fast.  There they go.  This is all part of the thrill and excitement of live radio as it happens, Opie.  Come up with something.  It doesn't matter.  This is a bonus show.  It doesn't matter, really.  We don't get paid for a bonus show.  Good.  It is.  God damn.  I'm never getting out of the city.  All right.  We almost there. 
[04:11:00]  Are you guys happy?  Because, you know, how about right there?  Yeah.  That hole right there, maybe.  On the plastic.  All right.  Patty.  All right.  Is that good?  There you go.  All right.  Then it's back to throwing the money all over the place.  Patty, back on your knees.  Get on the plastic and on all fours there.  And then throw the money around.  Just kind of sprinkle it liberally around the area. 
[04:11:30]  This is our testing of the money snatch.  These guys are lucky to be here today.  We try out all our bits before we bring it to the audience, usually.  Here at the O&A Institute.  That's right.  We like trying these things out.  Why does Patty have tan lines on her butt?  Are you tanning?  Jesus.  She's not talking anymore.  Yeah.  She didn't wipe good.  All right.  Are you ready?  Now the money is laid out.  She will have a minute.  Remember, Patty, now you've got a minute to pick it up. 
[04:12:00]  Roll it up as tight as you can.  And believe me, it's probably going to have to be pretty tight.  Put a condom on it.  And then shove it up there.  All right?  And we'll call off every ten seconds, I gather.  Should we give her a minute?  Yeah, a minute.  Yeah, a minute?  That seems like a real short amount of time.  And you guys all understand?  Because remember, she's got to do the roll-up thing also.  Maybe we should give her two minutes, just to be fair.  All right.  We'll give you two minutes, Patty.  We're actually a minute to collect all the money. 
[04:12:30]  And then, you know, then she has all the time in the world to roll it up.  Well, then she could take fucking forever.  We need her under a little bit of pressure.  All right.  Under pressure.  Two minutes, Patty.  Give her two minutes.  Here we go.  All right.  Ready?  Ready?  Set.  Set.  Go.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's collecting the money.  Picking up as many bills as she can.  Completely naked with a paper bag on her head.  She's searching around for all the money. 
[04:13:00]  How much time has elapsed so far, Dan?  Is it 20?  20 seconds.  20 seconds are gone, Patty.  All right.  20 seconds.  There's 10 20s in there.  There's 10 20s.  Very nice.  Wow.  Somehow makes $118.  She's picking it up.  All right.  All right.  How much time has elapsed?  30, now 40 seconds.  30 seconds, Patty.  You have a minute and a half left. 
[04:13:30]  Remember, you will have to roll.  You got to be.  Oh, she's organizing the money now.  She's organizing it.  This could be a big time waster.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't like her technique here.  She's collecting money.  She's collecting the bigger bills, I guess.  One minute left.  One minute, Patty.  One minute.  You have one minute to roll that up.  Get it in a condom.  What?  You think that's the best you can do?  Yeah.  She's putting it in the condom. 
[04:14:00]  Well, she is a virgin after all.  She's a virgin.  Don't rip that fucking thing.  What do you think?  It's made of steel?  All right.  Here.  All right.  Now she's shoving it up there.  Now.  And there we go.  She just got bombarded with red rubber balls and cup after cup of eggnog.  A fake jizz. 
[04:14:30]  That's got thrown all over her.  Holy shit.  All I know is, I saw Danny is the cruelest son of a bitch I've ever seen.  He wailed something right into her face.  I don't know if it was a ball or a fucking full cup of eggnog.  Look at her.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's covered in fake jizz.  She's still holding the money in her hand.  Count the money.  Count the money. 
[04:15:00]  Holy shit.  All right.  Wow.  Jesus.  That looks like plaster of Paris is all over.  Oh, I hope Sam got that.  Was someone taping that?  No, no.  Get the money, Patty.  Patty, you get all the money.  Don't worry.  Let's hear it for Patty.  Patty, you get all the money that's down there.  She's a complete mess, completely covered with fake jizz.  Yeah.  It's all yours, Patty.  She easily got hit with 100 red balls.  The run of Fez balls, I believe.  At least 100 of them.  Wait till you see this video.  We can't even explain it. 
[04:15:30]  We were handing out balls as she was on all fours.  Oh, that was on PalTalk the whole time.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  Got a good reaction from PalTalk.  Oh, I gather.  My God.  That was funny.  Holy shit.  I'm glad I had nothing to do with that.  It's all right.  We'll say goodbye, everybody.  Because we got a meeting anyway.  It's all right.  I guess that does it, Ant. 
[04:16:00]  Maybe we can get a mic on Patty just for one last comment.  All right.  We got the Yankees robe on her.  She's covered up in that.  I am all.  I've got all milk all over me.  Oh, that's huge.  What was in that stuff?  Was it milk and yogurt?  It feels like yogurt.  Well, it's.  Yeah.  It's our fake jizz concoction.  Fake jizz.  It's a secret.  We don't like letting it out of the Institute.  No, no.  Company secret.  That's right.  Just like Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Socks are ruined. 
[04:16:30]  Socks are ruined.  Who cares?  You got a hundred and, I don't know, close to 150 bucks.  Buy some new socks.  I'll get thrown in the laundry.  There you go.  We got lines of the day here.  I got plenty of lines.  One line of the day, a couple runner-up lines of the day.  It's brought to you by BodogFight.com.  BodogFight.com.
