<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a deep dive into the Manti Te'o catfishing scandal.  Opie, Anthony, Travis, and Sam Roberts dissected the conflicting narratives surrounding Te'o's fabricated girlfriend, using homophobic slurs and derogatory language while speculating about Te'o's sexuality and motivations.  They joked about the situation, referencing *Fargo*, and created a running "Te'o facts checklist" to track inconsistencies. Audio clips of Te'o discussing his "dead" girlfriend were played and analyzed, alongside discussions of catfishing and Deadspin's investigation revealing evidence of Te'o's potential involvement.  The hosts contrasted their own investigative approach with what they saw as the media's lazy reporting.  This analysis continued, focusing on the timeline of events and highlighting Te'o's delayed reporting and continued public grieving despite allegedly knowing the hoax.  The lack of photos with his girlfriend and the improbability of never meeting her were also discussed, further fueling speculation of Te'o's complicity.  The show referenced MTV's "Catfish" as a comparable phenomenon.

The show then abruptly shifted to Brooke Greenberg, a woman who hadn't aged beyond infancy despite being 20.  The hosts, shocked by photos and video clips, discussed her condition ("Syndrome X") and speculated on its emotional impact, interspersing this discussion with numerous offensive jokes, particularly from guest comedian Allie, targeting various racial and ethnic groups.  A false claim about Bubba Ray Dudley marrying Brooke Hogan was also addressed.  A caller then shared a story about their own 20-year-old daughter, Brooke, who hadn't physically aged in 15 years. The hosts and caller engaged in a darkly humorous and vulgar conversation, speculating about medical explanations, her awareness of her condition, and the potential for scientific exploitation of her situation.  Comedian Jim Jefferies called in, discussing his FX show "Legit," its production, casting, and personal anecdotes.  The conversation returned to the caller's daughter, followed by a segment on Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's gaffes and the reality show "Barter Kings," all laced with vulgar humor.  Barry, the hosts' financial advisor, briefly joined the discussion offering financial advice.

The show continued with discussions on economic issues ("lifting up the lower class"), a sponsor's oral sex enhancement product (SexualFlavors.com), and criticisms of reality TV, particularly "assisted reality" in biker bar shows.  A chaotic segment promoting Club Soda Kenny's sold-out Borgata show ensued, involving confusion over ticket sales and room reservations.  This led to discussions of Kenny's promotional skills, the hosts' need for babysitters,  Bubba Ray Dudley's upcoming wedding to Brooke Hogan (again), the Nicki Minaj/Mariah Carey feud on American Idol, and various "runner-up lines of the day," including jokes about a "pig mint." The show concluded with guest booking discussions, a preference for Arnold Schwarzenegger over other potential guests, a debate on potato chip-crusted chicken wings and the unpleasantness of chicken wing cartilage, and continued insults aimed at Barry regarding his bald head and perceived lack of engagement. Throughout the entire broadcast, profanity and vulgar language were pervasive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning everyone!  Ha ha noises!  Ha ha noises!  Hardy har noises!  There we go!  Yeah, tap-a-wah, tap-a-wah, tap-a-wah, tap-a-wah. 
[00:00:30]  What was that?  I'm singing that.  Tap-a-wah, ha-ba-wee.  We just spent the last half hour actually trying to prepare for this radio show.  We're trying to figure out this Tao story.  I am so fucking confused.  It's trending on Twitter, obviously.  Big story.  Big story on Deadspin, MSNBC, the Morning Joe people, they started their show with it. 
[00:01:00]  Everyone's talking about it.  All the news stations.  And I'm so damn confused.  Because there's so many different versions of what may or may not have happened.  Yeah.  Manti Teo, huh?  Manti Teo, the star of Notre Dame there.  Notre Dame!  Who was very close to winning the Heisman Trophy.  And he has like a dead girlfriend.  But now the dead girlfriend doesn't exist.  Or does she?  Oh no, we know that much. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, yeah, that we know.  That I know.  Yeah.  So I could check that off.  If someone was quizzing me, I know I would get that one right.  The dead girlfriend never existed.  Okay, so I would get that question right.  I've never heard the racial epithet quite like that one.  What?  What?  Wait, what did I miss?  Well, I'm seeing a racial epithet here on Pal Talk.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was something you said that went by me.  No, no.  I get...  What nationality is he?  I would guess a little of that Hawaiian.  Hawaiian or something. 
[00:02:00]  Or Samoan.  I don't know.  Somebody just called him a volcano.  And then the N word.  Oh, boy.  I've never heard that before, but okay.  All right.  Teo's checklist.  His dead girlfriend doesn't exist.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  That I know.  He might be Samoan or Hawaiian.  Okay, we're going to put that in the Teo checklist.  If anyone wants to help us out here, fuck.  We have a huge audience. 
[00:02:30]  Help us out.  Yeah.  Help us understand this story.  I guess there's a timeline that goes, he met this girl online.  Online.  Is what he's saying.  All right.  Now, beforehand, I never knew this online thing.  It sounded like they had been together.  Well, the online thing's been around since Al Gore invented it.  Right.  The intratubes.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So now you understand the online thing.  Somewhere in 2009, I believe, they supposedly met, but then it turns out they didn't really  meet in person. 
[00:03:00]  It's just a purely internet and telephone relationship.  So how do they meet?  I don't know.  Like a live voice on a telephone?  I don't know.  Again, I don't know.  And then by 2011, they were considered a, an item, a relationship, even though they had  never met in person.  All right.  So is the guy gay?  Is that where you're going?  Is this guy a gay guy?  I got to say, this could possibly be true.  Is he a gay guy?  Is he?  I don't know.  Well, well, why would you do that? 
[00:03:30]  Because now he's saying, okay, then, then, uh, this girl gets into a car accident, gets  injured.  Right.  And, uh, you know, he continues this relationship and talking to her.  Then I guess, uh, in 2000, September 11, 2012, wasn't it?  Hmm.  His grandma dies, and then hours later, she dies.  She had leukemia for a while.  He had talked to her on the phone and was trying to get her through this.  I thought, I thought she was in a car accident.  She was in the car accident, and she got injured in the car accident.  Did the car accident give her leukemia? 
[00:04:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  That'll make me laugh today.  But it's sounding a lot like Mike Yanniguita from, uh, Fargo.  Oh, she, she got leukemia, Margie.  She fought so hard, Margie.  You're such a super lady.  I'm so lonely.  It's fucking Mike Yanniguita.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She's Linda Cooksey.  She's fine.  He, he was harassing her for a while. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, gee.  Oh, my God.  Fargo, one of the greatest comedies ever.  She's such a super lady.  I look at it as a comedy, mostly.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  The old Fargo.  So the guy makes up a fake girlfriend.  Fake girlfriend.  Or, but he's saying it's not.  He didn't make her up.  Now this story that's coming out of his camp is that he is the victim of a very elaborate hoax.  Catfish?  That was perpetrated upon him.  Some of that catfish shit?  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  For reasons unknown, by the way, because there was never any attempted financial gain or anything.  All right.  All right.  Now, Opie has predicted, and as a member of this very program, you know, and the audience  knows, that in the past, this program has been very, very astute at picking out the bullshit  and giving it to you before anyone else.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to take the lead on this one.  And here it comes.  I'm going to take the lead on this one. 
[00:05:30]  Greg Opie is literate.  And I don't even know, I really don't know the ins and outs of this story.  I'm learning as we go along.  No, you know what?  It's called a hunch.  I got a good hunch.  You just get enough of the info, and now you got instincts.  I got a good hunch.  Yeah.  This kid, Tao, made up this whole fucking thing for whatever reason.  I don't know.  Maybe he's a little light in the loafers.  Trying to cover stories for the homosexuality.  Maybe he's mentally ill.  Right, right.  Maybe this was the little thing he needed to hopefully get the Heisman Trophy. 
[00:06:00]  That's the speculation.  But this guy, my hunch is this guy made up the whole fucking thing.  And in about two to three days, well, the weekend's coming, though.  Right, right, right.  He might skate the weekend.  You could just say by next week.  All right.  He might skate the weekend.  But early next week, you're going to see this guy in front of a lot of people breaking  down saying he made up the whole thing.  And we're going to be so uncomfortable.  Yes, there will be a statement.  We're going to be so uncomfortable.  Because now he's like, I'm the victim of a hoax.  And now he's got the athletic director pouring his heart out for this guy. 
[00:06:30]  And that's going to make people investigate.  And all the people that supported him will then turn around and support him, but say  he needs help.  Right.  And he obviously, we love him and he needs some help.  This is exactly like whenever the dick pictures came out for politicians, they would get on  and say, oh, my account was hacked.  Right.  My account was hacked.  And you're like, really?  Account was hacked?  And then a few days later, I want to apologize to my family, my wife, everyone else.  I hurt.  I hurt.  I hurt.  I hurt.  Judgment error.  We like to call it an eyepatch situation. 
[00:07:00]  We have an eyepatch situation here.  This is an eyepatch situation.  Remove the eyepatch.  He's going to remove the eyepatch.  There's no scratches.  And there's going to be a perfect eye underneath the eyepatch.  There's no glass.  This guy is going to be in front of a lot of people.  And it's going to be great TV.  And we're all going to feel what we like to call the douche chill.  The douche chill in full force because this guy absolutely faked this, did it himself.  There's some type of electronic trail.  There's other people involved. 
[00:07:30]  Sure.  People love these stories.  The news loves them.  They dig, dig, dig.  They're going to keep digging.  Yes.  And what they'll find is evidence.  Deadspin's already saying it was him that made it up.  They are saying that.  There's apparently a guy.  Oh, what the fuck?  And someone beat me to the hunch.  Well, Deadspin.  But the mainstream media, which, of course, Opie, we are part of.  Yes, I'm very excited about it, too.  You will see the mainstream media will run with the fact that it was a hoax and he's very hurt. 
[00:08:00]  But then in a few days, they'll be like, oh, info coming out.  Because Deadspin is saying that there's another guy involved that helped him perpetrate this hoax for whatever gains.  Like we've said, it might be the Heisman.  It might be the fact that perhaps there is a little sexuality question going on here.  And he was trying to cover up.  It's just really strange.  Very strange.  It's extremely strange, this one.  Very.  There are some creepy, mentally ill people in this world.  Just weirdos.  I want him reported. 
[00:08:30]  And if he has a gun, I want it taken away.  Well, that would be good.  Because he sounds like a mental case.  That would be good.  Yeah.  So what are our facts so far, Sam, as we build the case in front of everyone's eyes?  Okay, the facts are his dead girlfriend doesn't exist.  Oh, man.  He might be Samoan or Hawaiian.  The internet is a thing.  Right.  Is this the notes you've been taking during our discussion?  Yes.  Yes, very good.  The internet is a thing.  Uh-huh.  And we think it's a hoax.  What about sexuality?  Oh, yeah.  Could be a mo.  Well, no, I said light in the loafers. 
[00:09:00]  Light in the loafers.  I went old school.  I'm going to say mo.  You're going to go with mo.  I'm going to go with mo.  Probably a bit light in the loafers slash a mo.  A mo.  Also, could you please just put this in, too?  Queeb.  He's a queeb or a quay.  A quay?  What's his name?  Oh, okay.  That's...  A quay.  We used to call people quay.  That guy's quay.  Is that short for the queer?  That's like queer gay.  Queer gay.  So then the last fact is probably a bit light in the loafers slash mo. 
[00:09:30]  Also, he's most likely a queeb or a quay.  We don't know.  A queeb or a quay.  Can you add, so we don't get sued, but of course we don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course we don't know.  But of course we have no idea.  And of course there's nothing wrong with that.  Right.  Yeah, I mean, nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with it.  We're trying to build our audience.  We might need a few gays.  You know what?  Because 2013 OP is all about diversity.  Yeah, it sure is.  Whether it's gays, blacks, or the quays. 
[00:10:00]  So do I need to restate this for the record?  Yeah, please.  All right, run through the facts again, just in case people at home have just gotten a pen.  I want to jot it down.  It's a complicated story.  So the Teo facts checklist.  His dead girlfriend doesn't exist.  He might be Samoan or Hawaiian.  But can we, like, narrow that one down at least?  We should be able to quickly.  Can't someone at least, like, say it's a Hawaiian horse?  I think on his wiki page it probably tells where he's been. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  You know, where he's black.  These are the facts as they stand.  All right.  The internet is a thing.  That's true.  We think it's a hoax.  The internet?  No, no, no.  This is the hoax.  Oh!  Fact.  Because the internet is a thing.  Definitely.  That's a fact.  All right.  It's not a list.  And probably a bit light in the loafers slash mo.  Also, he's most likely a queeb or a quay.  But, of course, we don't know.  And, obviously, there's nothing wrong with that.  All right.  Very good.  I love a good fact sheet.  Just a bullet point.  We're fucking idiots. 
[00:11:00]  I love a good fact sheet to start the morning.  I'm sure we'll build on this as the story progresses, too.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Well, we got some bullet points here, thanks to Travis.  A real fact list.  Travis knows a little more about this, right?  By the way, after the legislation of Andrew Cuomo, we're only allowed seven bullet points on any sheet.  Really?  So, please keep them to seven bullet points.  We have 11.  My sheet is ten bullet points, but I only filled in seven. 
[00:11:30]  Ah!  That's very good.  Then we're compliant.  So, what do we know, Travis?  I really am so confused about this story.  Here's the problem with the story.  It's so complex that you really...  You can either do one of two things.  You can either go through the entire thing, or you can just say, you know, the short end of it is that, you know, he didn't have a girlfriend.  It was a lie the whole time.  Right.  But if you really want to get into it, it's fascinating.  Like, Deadspin did such an amazing job at just completely debunking this entire thing. 
[00:12:00]  She lived in Niagara Falls.  Hey!  Hey!  Like, they spent, you know, I don't even know how long taking her photos that everybody assumed were hers and doing, like, related image searches.  Where did the photos come from?  The photos ended up coming from some girl who has never met Manti before.  Did she come forward and say, hey, that's me, but fuck, I don't know.  Deadspin finally, I don't know how, Deadspin found her and said, hey, are these your photos? 
[00:12:30]  And...  This is Catfish, yeah.  Yeah.  And a couple of the photos were on her personal accounts, like Facebook and Instagram.  But one of the photos she never posted online.  Ever.  Ooh, that's crazy.  It was a personal photo.  Is it like Crazy Joe DiVola taking pictures of Elaine in the shower and stuff?  Yes, yes.  And then making a shrine to her?  In his dark room.  Before he got Panaka in the eyes?  She sent the photo to an old high school friend who got in touch with her saying, hey, my cousin 
[00:13:00]  was in a car accident.  What?  He saw your photos online, thinks you're really pretty.  I'm putting a slideshow together to make him feel better.  Would you mind sending me a photo?  Whoa.  This guy...  This is insane.  This guy is definitely friends with Manti.  Manti.  Ah.  So what does that mean?  There's online evidence that they know each other. 
[00:13:30]  He's been to games as Manti's guest.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, the guy  that asked for a photo, does he know the girl at all?  Yes, they're high school friends.  All right, so he knew the girl, but he also knows Manti.  Yes.  There's the common denominator.  Yes.  So how is he involved with this scandal part of it, besides just having a photo?  Apparently he created her in 2008, and Manti's not the first person who's had a, quote,  relationship with her. 
[00:14:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What the fuck?  So are you saying that Manti really did think she was real because this guy, like, fucked  him over?  Was bamboozling him?  I don't know.  My assumption is that he knew she was fake.  So what's the purpose?  Publicity.  It's a great story.  It's an inspirational and heartbreaking story.  What else did this guy use this fake  biography and pictures, this friend  of his? What else did he use it for?  Catfishing. Just as a goof? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah. As fun? Yeah. Is catfishing  a big thing? Dude, apparently it's very big.  It's a series now. No, I understand.  It's a series and I love the movie, but I  didn't realize it was a thing that a lot of people  are doing. I'm not going to use any names, but I know somebody.  I know a girl that  has made a profile  of a young  hip-hop guy  and has collected  probably six  young black women  as girlfriends  and just talks ghetto and 
[00:15:00]  bamboozles the hell out of them  into loving  the hip-hop guy. Yeah, I don't think  there's any financial gain to catfishing.  No, and then after a while, you  break up with them. You tell them  like, oh, I've been lying  about myself. Here's my picture.  And then sends a picture of an old corporate  businessman.  But I still love you.  I still loves you, though.  I mean, how many times has our own  Bobo been catfished?  Oh, yes, yes.  I'm just purely for fun,  but then they figured, why don't we 
[00:15:30]  do this for some type of gain,  perhaps the Heisman Trophy?  Oh.  Psychotic.  This is hilarious.  Yeah.  It gave him the edge on the Heisman Trophy,  but as we all know,  he came in second, right?  He came in second, yeah.  I mean, he's still a great football  player, like, whether his  girlfriend died or not.  Like, he's a  first-round pick.  He's a great football player.  But this story, you know,  kind of sets you apart from everybody.  He's obviously involved.  I think he is.  And he's going to have to break down  and tell everyone that it was wrong. 
[00:16:00]  I don't think he's dumb enough  to have fallen.  You know what might  clear this up a bit?  Ooh.  If we run through our checklist.  Again?  And see.  Okay.  You know, it might,  what we just heard from Travis.  Yeah.  Now, going back to the  facts checklist,  it might clear things up.  We're a big fan of the checklist.  Yes, yes.  Sam?  These are the facts as we know them.  As we know them.  And remember,  when we started the show today,  we didn't know much.  No, no.  We're breaking it down  in front of everybody.  Yes.  So, as we know it,  his dead girlfriend doesn't exist.  Uh-huh.  He might be Samoan or Hawaiian. 
[00:16:30]  Once again.  Can't we?  Can't we?  In the time since we last  read the checklist,  that hasn't been cleared up.  We haven't cleared that up yet.  No, not yet.  Why haven't we cleared that one up?  That seems like a pretty  easy one there.  I'm not willing to put anything  that is not a fact on the show.  All right.  So, we're still the he might be.  Right.  I like Sam's journalistic integrity.  Right.  Number three,  the internet is a thing.  Yes.  Number four,  we think it's a hoax.  Not the internet.  No.  No.  Why don't you put a  in parentheses,  we think it's a hoax, 
[00:17:00]  not the internet.  Yeah, because people  might get confused.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, good.  Hang on, I'll just add it.  Duh.  Oh, yeah.  That way, you know.  No, you added that.  Yeah.  Oh, you're right.  That's not a fact.  Uh-huh.  You added that.  Okay.  Don't editorialize.  Yeah, please.  He's probably a bit light  in the loafers slash mo.  Also, he's most likely  a queeb or a quay.  But, of course,  we don't know.  And, obviously,  there's nothing wrong  with that.  And the last fact,  newly added,  everyone loves to catfish.  Everyone seems to love  doing a little catfishing. 
[00:17:30]  I had no idea.  I didn't realize  the catfish thing  was as big as it obviously is.  This is very weird.  Let me go to Travis.  What do you think  of the gay angle?  Is that completely  just stupid?  The queeb angle.  Or a quay.  Or a mo.  Or is it more like,  this is a great story  and this could help me  with the Heisman.  He's Mormon.  I don't know.  They get really fucked up.  That was another big story.  He's a Mormon  going to a Catholic school.  Right.  Nobody expected that.  But, I mean,  if you're going to win  the Heisman,  they're really going  to look at you.  Yeah, yeah.  So, he has to be  half fucking crazy  to think this would have worked  to get him the Heisman trophy. 
[00:18:00]  Give him the edge  on that, anyway.  If he is telling the truth,  then he was obviously  embarrassed by  some part of this relationship  because he talked about,  you know,  they met at a football game.  They never met  at a football game.  No.  Yesterday, he said  it was completely online.  You know,  that he had actually  never met her.  This is odd.  But why wouldn't  the guy want live pussy?  Right.  And he didn't go  to the funeral?  He didn't go  to the funeral  because he said  that she insisted  he never miss a game. 
[00:18:30]  So, he didn't go  to the funeral.  And people were buying this  for how long  before it all fell apart?  Uh, well,  she died in September.  If they were so in love,  wouldn't the family  have maybe put the...  Family never met her.  No, I mean,  wouldn't her family  have maybe put the funeral  off for a day  where her true love  isn't playing football?  Well, obviously,  there's a, yeah,  a lot of red flags here.  There was a...  Yes, a lot of red flags.  A lot of red flags here.  A lot of red flags here. 
[00:19:00]  Put that on the checklist.  Please.  A lot of red flags.  On ESPN last night  who had done a piece  previously about them  and saying, you know,  like, in hindsight,  a lot of things, you know,  don't add up anymore.  You know,  when I was doing my report,  I asked, you know,  can I get in touch  with the girlfriend's family  for photos?  And he said,  oh, you know,  they would prefer  to be left alone.  Of course,  because they don't exist.  Yeah.  Well, can I add this too?  We've talked about  how lame the media is  and they're lazy  and they don't do  their own fucking homework.  This is a perfect example.  There's just so many things here 
[00:19:30]  where if you were  a real reporter  or a real news organization,  you would have dug  a little deeper  instead of just assuming  and copying and pasting  something you saw  by another reporter.  It's such lazy journalism  when you realize  that there was no record  of her death,  no obituary,  no funeral announcement,  no mention of it  in a college paper  that she supposedly attended,  no record of her birth,  no record of a car accident  that she was supposedly in.  So, like,  wouldn't you think  that at some point  some reporter  would at least try 
[00:20:00]  to find the obituary  for her?  Of course.  You're right, though.  It's just complete  lazy reporting.  And then,  I don't understand  why he did this.  He obviously is involved  in some way.  Because after the fact  that where it all came out  in their circle  that this was fake,  he continued  with the bullshit story  with other people.  Yeah.  Didn't he?  Yeah.  Is him not wanting  live pussy  that Opie mentioned  is a fact?  That's far as...  Well, I question.  That's a question.  I think as far as facts,  for the checklist goes... 
[00:20:30]  That would be on  the Troy Kwan list  of questions.  Questions.  I got questions.  I got questions.  Because you're a star athlete.  You're going to go  to the NFL.  You might win  the Heisman Trophy  and you're not  into live pussy.  Yeah.  You're having this  weird internet relationship  with someone  that you never met.  Hence...  You never flew her in.  Hence, we go back  to the Moe.  To the Moe.  To the Moe.  To the Moe.  To the Moe.  To the Moe.  California.  And we're...  Oh, and he's in  Notre Dame, obviously.  So why wouldn't he  fly her in for a game?  Apparently, they met  at a game in California.  No, they didn't, though.  No, they didn't.  Because she didn't exist.  Now he's... 
[00:21:00]  And he said they met  at a game.  He said they met  at a game.  He would talk to her  on the phone every night.  You think this will  fuck up his NFL career?  Yes!  He's a crazy person!  He said teams  are going to think  twice before they  draft him now?  And they're not  giving the Heisman  trophy to a fucking  lunatic either.  Well, he didn't win it.  Well, he didn't win it.  But they never...  He won a lot of  other awards.  Well, how close  was the voting?  Was it really close  this year,  the Heisman  trophy voting?  I don't really  follow college football.  Maybe he knew  he needed a little  something extra  because he knew  that, you know...  Yeah, there's  something we don't  know yet.  He was going to 
[00:21:30]  fall short of the  Heisman.  He might talk today.  He's going to talk  whether it's today  or really soon.  And he already  released the statement.  It's going to be  really uncomfortable.  Not believable, but...  And then you've got  the athletic director  supporting him still.  We've got that audience.  Are there media clips  of him talking  about this girl?  Yeah.  Oh, we've got to  play some of them.  I want to hear those  more than I want  to hear my own voice.  Go to Deadspot.  We've got to  hear those.  Holy mother of God,  this guy is bat shit.  How many bullet points  have we done  from your list there, 
[00:22:00]  Travis?  You've pretty much  got it.  We've got most of them?  If it's seven,  we have to now go  to a new bullet point  sheet written on  a separate  magazine piece of paper.  Oh, oh, we got...  Oh, there's the timeline.  I need audio.  God, do I want to  hear him talking  about his girlfriend  that doesn't exist.  Okay.  We've got to wait  25 seconds.  Why?  And then I have  to find the clip.  For Nick Kroll to finish.  Let's just keep talking  and when we...  It's a Radisson,  so it's pretty good. 
[00:22:30]  There are a couple  new facts  on our facts checklist.  All right.  And hold on.  Before you...  You want to add  any of these  to the fact checklist.  The dead girlfriend  called him  two months  after she supposedly died.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did hear this.  I mean, that's  in the Notre Dame clip.  Okay.  You know,  they're saying  that how Manti  found out  about all of this  is that when he was  at the ESPY Awards,  he got a phone call  from her phone number.  Was he really 
[00:23:00]  at the ESPY Awards?  Ah.  I don't believe  anything this guy says.  So he gets a phone call  from the phone number  that he thought  was Linnea's.  Congratulations.  There's only one...  There's only one...  The phones are lit,  but there's only one  call I want to take  because Robert  in Birmingham  has a little something.  Robert,  go ahead, sir.  Yeah,  I live in Birmingham.  When our guy,  Mark Ingram,  the running back,  got the Heisman 
[00:23:30]  a couple years ago,  the whole time  leading up to that,  there was this  special interest story  that his dad's  been in prison  and, you know,  a lot of what he does  is for his dad  and all that,  and this story  kept going on,  and every time  he was talked about  for the Heisman  with the other candidates,  this side story  was always mentioned.  And so it looks like  this has been cultivated  for that same thing  to sort of give  this extra attention  for him  when you look at him  with the other guys.  So obviously  Ingram's story  was false. 
[00:24:00]  No,  Ingram's story  is true.  His dad actually  is in trouble.  Oh, but also  it did work for him,  so somebody might  look at that  and go,  wow,  the sympathy angle  works,  let me fake some of it.  All right,  I got you.  So Ingram,  that gave him the edge  as far as the Heisman  trophy went.  It might have inspired  some shenanigans.  It inspired possibly  this situation.  Possible shenanigans.  Gotcha.  Maybe,  I'm also hearing  that late one night  he got a phone call  from her  after she died  and she was talking  to him  saying,  hello,  hello, 
[00:24:30]  hello,  and then the next morning  they followed  the phone line.  You know where it went?  Where?  The cemetery.  Whoa!  And one of the phone lines  had come down  in a storm  and laid right across  the grave  and the tombstone.  That's fucked up.  Yes!  What?  What's that soon?  What are you doing?  Oh, okay.  We have a clip  of him talking  about it now.  Oh, please.  So what year  is this from?  This year.  And by the way,  a couple months ago?  I could tell  if people are batshit crazy 
[00:25:00]  just by listening  to him talk  and watching him.  Okay!  No, no.  Okay!  Hey, brother,  she hit her head.  Okay!  Oh, my God!  She hit her head.  Okay!  When she got out  of the car!  And, uh,  I continued driving.  Yeah, I drove around  for eight hours.  I was in Allentown,  okay!  I dumped her body.  I mean, I dumped her.  I mean, I left her  at the hotel.  I'm gonna blink a lot  and touch my face, okay?  Which is obviously  a sign of lying.  Right.  Okay!  Okay! 
[00:25:30]  Okay, brother.  All right, let's see, uh,  Tao.  The only thing  that is completely true,  by the way,  is that his grandmother  did die.  Who's?  Tao.  Yeah.  Well, everyone's grandma died.  Did he have a grandma?  But this was the thing,  is that his grandmother died,  and then six hours later  he found out  that his girlfriend died.  So it's overcoming  all of this tragedy  in such a short amount of time.  I work at Honeywell.  But that's...  You could do a lot worse.  His grandmother did pass away.  This guy's good.  Think about it.  Grandma dies,  then you throw in,  oh, when the girlfriend died,  now it's all fucking...  Crazy.  It's like a fucking hornet's nest. 
[00:26:00]  Where do you begin?  What about his imaginary  cat or dog?  Yes.  Did they suffer, um,  any, uh, injuries?  Come up blind.  This is crazy.  This sounds like  one of E-Rock's  convoluted, vague, uh,  fucking screenplays.  All right, let's, uh,  listen to Tao  a couple months ago, I guess?  Yeah.  All right.  The answer that I got  to come to this school  wasn't the answer  that I was expecting,  and it wasn't the answer  that I wanted.  Mm-hmm.  But, luckily for me, 
[00:26:30]  I had great parents  that taught me  the importance of having faith.  He's crazy.  Yes, sir?  Faith was tested  to its core  on September 12th.  Ha-ha!  Tao was awakened  by an early morning  phone call  from his parents.  They told him  his grandmother,  Annette Santiago,  had died  after an extended illness.  That happens.  And then,  just six hours later,  Oh, what?  One heartbreaking loss...  What?  ...was followed by another. 
[00:27:00]  This is tragic.  An older brother  called me,  and he was just crying  and crying and crying,  and that's when I kind of knew,  but I was still in denial.  And I was like,  don't tell me you're crying.  Could you pause this  for a second?  That's what I'm thinking.  Please.  At this point,  does he know this is fake?  At this point,  when he's doing this interview,  does he know  this is fucking fake?  Well, it depends  on what you believe.  If you believe  that he was in on it,  then yeah,  he knows it's fake.  If you believe  that he was a victim  of a hoax,  then no,  he still thinks  that it's all real.  This is so creepy, dude. 
[00:27:30]  I believe he knew  the entire time.  Yeah, I gotta go  with that, too.  She fought so hard, Margie.  I gotta go with that, too,  that he knew the whole time.  How do you not  in this day and age?  Of course!  How do you not?  How about this, also?  You know why?  He didn't send anything  to the hospital?  What about get well cards?  What about the address  to the hospital?  Where was it?  Right.  He didn't send  a one fucking get well  mylar balloon? 
[00:28:00]  And where was she sick?  Back in California?  Yeah, he couldn't find it.  She was in a car accident.  When she was in the hospital  for the car accident,  she was diagnosed  with leukemia.  She got better.  She eventually graduated college,  which never happened.  Oh, my God.  He didn't go to her graduation?  No, apparently not.  And how many years  were they together?  Since 2012.  From 2009 till 2012.  Yeah, I think they didn't  become like a couple  until 2011.  But how long did he know her?  Since 2009?  Oh, my God.  This guy's the biggest 
[00:28:30]  bullshitter.  He knew the whole time.  I'm sorry.  He knew the whole time.  In three years,  he never met her?  He's very unbelievable.  And then she's in a car accident  and she has leukemia  and he doesn't go out  to see her?  Never saw her?  Who the fuck does that?  And obviously,  he didn't send her anything  because there was never  an address to the hospital  or anything.  What the fuck?  He said that he would  stay...  She was in a coma.  Now she's in a coma, too?  This is crazy.  His wife's in a coma. 
[00:29:00]  He would stay on the phone...  I had sex with your wife!  I had sex with your imaginary girl.  Or he would stay on the phone  with her  and just fall asleep  while she was in...  While she was on coma phone?  Like on the other side  of the fucking...  Yeah, because...  Is there phone records of this?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  This is crazy.  Probably not.  The clip we're watching  is really creepy  because it's very believable.  So is he that fucking nuts?  Right.  That's crazy.  Or is he that stupid?  Pathological.  I think he knew the whole time.  I think he knew the whole time, too, 
[00:29:30]  because he's already lied  a lot about it.  Saying that they met...  Oh, he's going to break down  and have to admit everything.  I can't wait for that!  What do you think  is happening today?  If her death  affects him so tragically,  like he's talking,  and we'll hear in a couple of seconds  here when we start this up again,  he would have had a feeling  where he had to see her.  Like, if I was that in love with somebody  and they were that ill,  you would drop everything  to see them,  to have some kind of physical contact  with that person. 
[00:30:00]  This guy is full of fucking shit!  Of course.  Stop with your bullshitting!  Of course.  Oh!  There's not a guy alive  that wouldn't drop everything  if you're in that...  Right!  You wouldn't go to your loved one's funeral.  And if you didn't,  and just were acquaintances on the internet,  then it wouldn't affect you like this.  Six to one and a half  does the other thing!  Holla!  I don't know.  Yeah, that's a great point.  If you had only just talked online,  this wouldn't be this...  Yes, yes!  All right, let's play the rest of this clip.  Please. 
[00:30:30]  And that's when he just said,  she's gone.  Yeah.  Mateo's girlfriend,  Lene Keikua,  who was battling leukemia,  had died.  Lene Keikua!  I just lost everything.  And, you know,  I cried,  I yelled.  I've never felt that way before.  This is six hours ago,  I just found out grandma passed away.  This is crazy.  You take, you know,  the love of my life. 
[00:31:00]  Last thing she said to me was,  I love you.  She never said no.  No, she didn't.  And the reporter never checked on this.  Lene had made Teo promise  that if anything happened to her,  he wouldn't miss a game.  Teo's doing a Tebow.  That Saturday night,  he was on the field  at Michigan State.  Wow.  What bravery.  Oh, look.  Pause.  This is so uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting so confused.  This is an eye patch situation.  Eye patch.  Eye patch.  And then he allows the whole crowd  to fucking feel for him. 
[00:31:30]  Holy fuck.  He did like to kiss his finger,  tap his chest,  and looked up at the fucking heavens  where his imaginary girlfriend is.  Oh, my God.  That's where Jesus lives.  Jesus lives up there.  Yeah, her last words were never,  I love you.  They never spoke.  Nope.  Ever.  She didn't exist.  No, she didn't.  Not only did she never exist.  Oh, my God.  Now, I completely think he knew the whole time,  but let me just throw this out there.  If this was a huge hoax, 
[00:32:00]  there had to be a girl involved  that was calling him, right?  Yeah.  Is anyone saying that?  Well, it's so...  A fake girl, obviously,  putting him apart.  Like, now he's saying,  or now the Notre Dame athletic director  is saying that it was completely online.  So now it depends on, you know,  what you believe.  Do you believe that it was completely online  and that he never spoke to her?  But he had said he did.  Then he's been lying about that.  Right.  So how do you believe that he... 
[00:32:30]  They are playing this,  and this piece we're watching right now,  like he had a real, true, regular girlfriend.  That's what everybody thought until yesterday.  Right.  He was flying to see her and all that shit.  Up until yesterday,  that's what everybody thought.  Why didn't this guy mention,  because he didn't know,  this reporter,  that it was an online thing?  Right.  That's a big deal.  Because they didn't know.  Nobody knew.  You just take your word for it.  You don't ask questions.  You know, oh, this is my girlfriend.  Right.  But no one saw him with her. 
[00:33:00]  What a fucking nut this guy is.  I mean, this is pathological.  If you can pull,  like get on the field,  do that,  have interviews,  talk about this dead girl  and emote.  I want to add to our list.  Oh, nice.  One thing,  this is what I want to add.  One thing is certain.  He's a kook.  Oh, good.  Yes, yes.  Regardless.  Regardless of how this plays out,  he's a kook.  Even if he was trying to garner sympathy  for the Heisman Trophy.  He spelled kook. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, technically kook.  Even if he was trying to get sympathy  for the Heisman Trophy  or if he was trying to cover up  maybe some sexuality issues,  he's still crazy.  He's nuts no matter what.  Yes.  He's either extremely naive  or completely crazy.  He's a kook.  Oh, I love this.  He's a kook either way.  I love this.  His official statement says  that they spoke on the phone,  but Notre Dame last night  says it was completely online.  And wait till you hear 
[00:34:00]  the athletic director.  Oh, my God.  He's going to be extremely embarrassed  in the next couple days.  When I heard him,  I thought he was going to talk  about his two bad knees  and his dream to become...  Jesus Christ.  Some 18 years ago  I left Dayton, Ohio  with two very bad knees.  Oh, yeah.  What else?  And a dream to become  a Major League Baseball player.  I hope that worked out for you.  God, I hope that worked out.  Did it...  What happened?  I think God  the dream came true.  Oh, thank God.  Good for you. 
[00:34:30]  The dream came true.  Oh, good for you.  Good for you.  Oh, good.  I mean, there's still  an entire part of the story  that we haven't even  talked about yet.  What's that?  Which is what Notre Dame  is saying.  Oh, right.  That he found out, you know.  Let's play the rest of this clip  because this kind of brings  a lot of the story together.  I am loving...  Go back a little bit.  So his girlfriend dies.  He promised her  he would never miss a game.  Now he's on the field  and letting everyone  feel bad for him. 
[00:35:00]  Praying.  And then he's saluting her  in the heavens.  This is so embarrassing to watch.  Oh, my God.  And this is Division I football.  This is like the...  Some say the best  college player of the year.  Oh, my God.  ...promise that if anything  happened to her,  he wouldn't miss a game.  That Saturday night,  he was on the field  at Michigan State.  Okay.  Very emotional.  His grandmother  passing away over in Hawaii  and then shortly thereafter  a very good friend. 
[00:35:30]  The game came easily  for the tale that night.  He is stopped  in the backfield  by Manti Teo.  He recorded 12 tackles,  recovered a fumble,  and broke up  two passes in the win.  They were with me.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't do it without them.  I couldn't do it without  the support of my family  and my girlfriend's family.  And I miss them.  I miss them.  But I know that  I'll see them again one day.  No, you won't.  The following Friday night...  Not even a grandma  because you're a lying...  You're a sinning liar. 
[00:36:00]  Manti Teo!  Manti Teo!  Oh, my...  They all started waving  the number five  with their hand  and they had the lays on  and it was an incredible scene  that forced me to ask...  Lays or lies?  ...speak.  40 years ago...  Ah, buffering.  All right.  Holy shit.  As it buffers,  let's go back to our checklist.  We're really breaking  this story down there.  This is...  All right.  Let's go through them  from the top again,  if you will.  This is the facts.  This is what we know.  Teo.  About Teo. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  His dead girlfriend  does not exist.  Absolutely not.  Check.  He might be Samoan  or Hawaiian.  Wait a minute.  Why is there a might  on this list?  Remember a little while ago  we said that we could kind of...  Do you remember  that we could break  that one down finally?  It might be either  one of those two.  It's one click  of the mouse  to find that out.  It may be...  Can you at least add  I'm leaning toward Hawaiian?  Okay.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Could you at least...  Yes.  Probably Hawaiian.  Okay.  Okay.  Probably Hawaiian.  Is that that Hawaiian player? 
[00:37:00]  Remember how we're talking about  reporters don't do their fucking...  Uh-huh.  That is a lion player.  We're talking about  how reporters don't do  the basics.  Yeah.  So we should do the basics.  Oh.  Yes.  But at least we're  to the point where  we're saying probably Hawaiian.  Probably Hawaiian.  All right.  Good.  The internet is a thing.  Right.  We think it's a hoax.  Not the internet.  Right.  Right.  Probably a bit  light in the loafers  slash Moe. 
[00:37:30]  Also...  That's my favorite.  He's most likely  a queeb or a quay.  Yeah.  But of course  we don't know.  Right.  And obviously  there's nothing wrong  with that.  Of course.  Everyone loves  to catfish.  Sure.  A lot of red flags here.  Yes.  The news media  are a bunch  of lazy bums.  When he talks  we will get douche chills.  Yes.  His grandma is dead  but everyone's grandma dies.  I think Opie reiterated that.  Sure.  He's a kook either way.  Yes.  A kook.  That should be in bold.  Can you change the font 
[00:38:00]  for that one?  Bold type on that one.  Just for the last one.  Just that one.  Just make it a little bigger.  Just so it stands out.  And by the last one  you mean the last one  for now.  Of course.  Of course.  Oh look at that.  Nice.  This list is constantly updating.  Why didn't the regular  news media do this?  Make a checklist.  Get together with each other.  Hash it out like we are here.  I don't know.  And why assume anything?  You know?  Especially with the  Samoan Hawaiian deal.  Yes.  Just assumptions  are not the deal.  Although his grandmother's name  sounded suspiciously Spanish.  Ooh. 
[00:38:30]  I know what it is.  Long shot.  Right.  Long shot Spanish.  Long shot Spanish.  Yes.  Probably Hawaiian.  Long shot Spanish.  There you go.  And then on grandmother's side.  Because we're not going to  look foolish like the rest  of the media.  We're going to cover  all our bases.  Yes.  On grandma's side.  Right.  Bases I should say.  Yes.  Okay.  Back to the YouTube clip  that should have buffered  by now.  Oh boy.  It looks like everyone  wants to watch this clip.  Oh yeah.  It's stuck here.  Is this guy going to have  a viral video from this?  I would rewind a little. 
[00:39:00]  Just refresh and then  start from three.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at Dr. Gaines.  Oh.  He knows his way  around the internet.  Oh good.  A 1600 pen clip.  Ah.  And we have Josh Gad  coming in tomorrow.  A little plug for him.  It wasn't that far.  It wasn't that far.  It was 309.  It was 309.  All right.  All right.  Go back a little further  because the Michigan  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right there.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  It was an incredible scene  that forced me to ask 
[00:39:30]  Manti to come up and speak.  Four years ago  I made a decision  to come here  and uh  From Dayton?  I didn't really know why.  In times like these  I know why.  I love each and every one of you  and I can't thank you enough for it.  Oh my God.  Is he crying?  Is he crying?  That's a fake cry.  Oh my God.  That's someone trying to cry.  Oh my God. 
[00:40:00]  No matter how much  I try to picture it in my head  what it would look like  I could never have  painted that picture  of what I saw on there.  One dog looking one way  one looking the other  In a close win against Michigan  Down the middle  saying my girlfriend said  Tail intercepted two passes  and he did it  on the same day  that Lene was buried.  I literally put them with me  and after every play I made  I said that's for you.  That's for both of you.  That was his roommate  the night before the game.  Pause.  This is his roommate?  Holy 
[00:40:30]  Holy  shit.  I am so fucking  douched out.  What an inspirational story.  Wow.  They wanted  to believe this.  The media  I think the media  plays their part.  This is the perfect  like oh my god  look at him.  Oh this guy  the game  the fucking  Just imagine the vignettes  Bob Costas would make  out of this.  No true shame.  Ah right.  And he transcended  his sorrow  and took to the field.  Well bleh bleh bleh 
[00:41:00]  No true shame  they're calling it.  That's pretty funny.  College football  is a weird fucking world  huh?  They got some fucked up  shit going on  the last couple of years.  Lion sack of shit  on my favorite team.  I don't like it  and here's the other thing  like now  all of these news outlets  are just saying  oh he was a victim  of catfishing  because Notre Dame  says he was a victim  of catfishing.  They're still not  doing their own shit.  Come on.  Read the entire report  on Deadspin  and then make your own  decision.  Right.  It's really almost obvious  that he was in on it. 
[00:41:30]  It's obvious.  But now they're just saying  oh Notre Dame says  it was catfishing  and it was catfishing.  And they just go with that  like alright  they run with this.  Do they have a department  at all that can make  a couple phone calls?  Right.  They go we're not  just taking your word  that it was catfishing.  Why are we the only ones?  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  They're calling it  a sick joke.  And we don't even  have a news department  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well that's kind of  my thing.  It's just use  your own fucking brain.  Right.  Sit down with your  buddies.  Hash it out like we are. 
[00:42:00]  Write yourself  a fact checklist.  I didn't even know  much about this story  when we first started  and now I feel like  I'm getting it here.  Here's this morning's  conversation right when  I walked in the door.  Opie's sitting down.  I walk in.  It's on the TV.  I go how about this story huh?  And Opie goes yeah.  And then there's a little  bit of silence  and then Opie goes  what's going on  with this anyway?  And I go I have no clue.  I think we were both  making believe we knew.  I know I wanted to hear  your side so I could  like get up to date  because we both  had no fucking clue. 
[00:42:30]  Alright confession time.  The first I heard  of this story  was late last night.  Me too.  On Twitter.  I saw people  joking about it.  I'm like I don't know.  I really am so  not in on this one.  Until today.  Ask you.  Until today.  Oh this happened this  and I go oh okay  I'm up to date.  The point being  in a little over an hour  we know more  than most of the  news organizations.  Yes.  And I didn't even know  about this story  until late last night.  No.  Right around the time  I went to bed  I'm like wow  what the fuck's going on  with this thing?  This thing seems a little weird. 
[00:43:00]  Now we're doing our own  investigative journalism.  That's how you do it though.  That's why I like  breaking it down  in front of everyone.  Can we go back  to the YouTube clip  that sort of puts  a lot of this together?  Oh god.  The roommate's  going to speak huh?  Yes.  That's for both of you.  That was his roommate  the night before the game.  How dumb is this guy?  You know he could  barely sleep.  You know it was just  a rough night for him  and for him to be able  to show up the next day  and you know play  inspired and play  as hard as he did.  It was just fitting  that he got the game  ball or Lene got the game. 
[00:43:30]  I love each and every  one of you.  We had our highs  we had our lows  but at the end of the day  we stuck together.  He is loving the attention.  Michigan and Notre Dame fans  standing with Lays on  just love.  It looked like love.  It was love.  And when you see that  that's when you know  that  he's gone.  I know I was sent here.  He's sent you for a reason.  He's gone.  He's gone.  He's gone.  You get that confirmation. 
[00:44:00]  He's gone.  You made the right choice.  I swear to you  I don't know.  I got another hunch.  Does he come from  like a broken family?  No.  He's got the mom  and the dad  and the  alright.  He is an attention  He needs the attention  for whatever reason.  Lunatic.  Like crazy attention.  Yes.  He's standing up  in the middle  of the locker room  addressing the team  talking about  his dead girlfriend  that doesn't exist.  Holy fuck. 
[00:44:30]  And he's a great player.  Jesus Christ.  But I guess  Bobo's relationship  with that Katie girl  on Twitter  is more real  than this fucking  relationship.  Oh I'm out.  Oh Jesus.  No dude.  It's tragic.  I'm out.  I'm all in with that one.  It's hilarious.  I'm with the nail  right.  Right.  I was with a  I'm inspired  right.  They're catfishing him.  I don't know  what's going on  with that  but it's  it's fucking hilarious. 
[00:45:00]  Katie  you haven't tweeted me  in two minutes  alright.  I gotta hear from you.  I love you.  Did you see Jim yesterday?  I'm heartbroken  alright.  Could you just tweet me?  Katie are you there?  I'm here.  Why don't you tweet me?  Alright.  1137 are you there?  1138 I want to talk to you.  1139 are you there?  1140.  Why aren't you replying to me?  Jimmy was  putting her in his tweets  saying  I can't wait to see you  and  when we're fucking  it's going to be great.  You know what  when  when you have  a hundred percent brain 
[00:45:30]  that shit will  drive you nuts  and now he's missing  in my humble opinion  he's missing a little bit  of his brain  to go through  that emotion  and that feeling  we all felt  when we first fell in love  oh I know  oh it's gotta be  I know  it's gotta be  it's gotta be  he sits there  and he tweets  and says things like  if I don't hear  I'm gonna be  I'm gonna cry  until I hear from you  I will be crying  until  I look at  the bag of gifts  that I was gonna give you  when you were supposed  to come for Christmas  and I start crying  pathetic  oh my god 
[00:46:00]  you're all going to hell  alright where are we  so that clip's over  yes  is our checklist over  well I'll read the checklist  oh no we got the  athletic director  that's right  I knew there was something else  you're caught up  pretty much  up until this  I can't believe  this happened  to his girlfriend  Susie  you know  Suze  Suze  the media  the media is  the media is 
[00:46:30]  embarrassed  and they're gonna  make it hurt now  because  you know  they got embarrassed  by this guy  so they're gonna  make it fucking hurt  they're gonna have  their payback  with this guy  you watch  so now last night  the athletic director  the athletic director  comes out  and basically says  yeah we've known  since last month  what  that  it was fake  that it was fake  it's all in the clips  the clips are a little long  but I mean  oh please  like I said  the story  is not  short  now they're saying  they knew it was fake 
[00:47:00]  but not on his part  he's the victim  he is the victim  they knew it was fake  and they launched  some kind of  an investigation  that led them to believe  that somebody was  bamboozling  a man tied tail  yes  okay  so here's the  athletic director  a man tied tail  Jack Swarbrick  yes  Swarbrick  on the morning  of  December 26th  very early  Alex Unger  was asked to remove  himself  from his  place of residence  request came from 
[00:47:30]  his dead  imaginary girlfriend  sorry  he lost the  Klugman huh  yeah  good old  Kluggy  Manti called  his coaches  to inform them  that while he was  in attendance  at the ESPN  awards show  in Orlando  he received  a phone call  from a number  he recognized  as having been  that he associated  with 
[00:48:00]  Linnea  Kakua  and when he  answered it  it was a person  whose voice  sounded like  the same voice  he had talked to  who  told him  that she was  in fact  not dead  come on  what  this is hilarious  with a straight  face dude  you're saying  this with a  straight face  I'm not  dead  Manti  promptly  took a 
[00:48:30]  fireplace  poker  and shoved it  through her eye  where she then  did die  she was in fact  a zombie  I'm just  staring at  Al Sharpton  what the fuck's  going on with  this guy  he keeps  losing weight  he is now  a shrunken head  he looks like  an old shoe  he's a shrunken  head  it's creepy  what's going on  with him  you ever skin  an apple  and carve a face  in it  and leave it  on the windowsill  what's going on 
[00:49:00]  with this guy  he looks terrible  he's got  fucking wolfman  hair  his hair  sticks out  like he's  brushed back  one of those  speed bicycle  guys  yeah  he really does  look like  when you carve  a pumpkin  and then it  just collapses  into itself  it falls in  yes  after a week  after Halloween  he's got one  of those weird  helmets on  but it's his  hair  alright sorry  oh god  oh look look  why  tail told his  coaches about  the hoax  on December  20th  ok that's where  we don't need  them  trust me 
[00:49:30]  we're doing  a much better  show than  CNN  I will guarantee  you that much  we got the facts  by the way  everything we're  saying here  will come out  in mainstream  media in a few  days  we have it  for you now  this ends  with him  press conference  admitting that  he fucking  made up the  whole fucking  thing  in shame  right  yes  Manti  was very  unnerved  by that  as you might  imagine  I will let him 
[00:50:00]  again talk about  that and his  reaction to it  but he  maintained  that  secret  vis-a-vis  the members  of the  football family  until he  called the  coaches  on the  morning of  the 26th  it was 20  days after  they promptly  reached out  to me  to inform  me  of this  shocking  piece of  news  and I  arranged  to meet  Manti  upon his  return to  campus  and did 
[00:50:30]  so on the  afternoon  of the  27th  now he  told them  that it  was a  hoax  that he  was the  victim of  a hoax  what  transpired  after he  told them  it was a  hoax  that we  got  to find  out  we got  this in  three parts  oh I  love it  that's the  first part  and they're  standing behind  him here  right  Notre Dame  they can't  stand behind  him  no one has  a girlfriend  online like  that 
[00:51:00]  unless you're  completely  nuts  behind  the fact  that he  was the  victim of  a hoax  whether that's  true or not  that's what  Notre Dame  is saying  it wasn't  just Facebook  magic  myspace  magic  with a  picture  something like  that  because we've  all fallen  for that  one  haven't we  guys  come on  let's all  get together  maybe they  just wanted  Teo's  password  stop it  Teo's  not  lawyer  I can't  wait for the  players to  come out  and go  yeah we  all knew  and we  all  you know  know that 
[00:51:30]  he's just  fucking  nuts  yeah  batshit  because they  had to be  wondering why  haven't we  ever seen  this girl  it's this  girl  why haven't  you just  like you  know flew  out there  to see  you only  have three  pictures of  yeah  right  here's  yeah  yeah  you think  you only  had three  three pictures  probably I  mean  in this  day and  age  you got  a hundred  pictures of  your duties  alone  why would  you only  have three  pictures of  your love  interest 
[00:52:00]  and a  decision was  made to  engage and  investigate an  independent  investigative firm  to see if they  could determine  what was it the  nature of what  increasingly appeared  to us to be a  sophisticated hoax  sophisticated we  received a final  report from  them on  january 4th  who did the  investigations just  some knuckleheads  at notre dame  or real 
[00:52:30]  investigators I  think they  hired outside  they did  hire  interesting  I met  with  brian and  otilia  teow in  miami on  the fifth  his pants  to share  with them  the essence  of those  findings  we left  that meeting  with  an  understanding  that they  would think  about  what they 
[00:53:00]  had heard  engage  mantis  future  representation  which would  be determined  later in the  week  in consultation  as to how  best respond  and keep  the university  fully informed  of their  intentions  and work  in concert  with us  when they  were ready  to communicate  the story  it was my  understanding  is my  understanding 
[00:53:30]  that they  were on a  timetable  to release  the story  themselves  next week  that's my  favorite part  yeah we're  releasing it  hey we were  going to release  it next week  yeah they're  saying that  that that  manti was  was going to  release this  story next  week anyway  all right  all right i  got i got  some things  they  notre dame's  panicking like  wait a minute  what the fuck  uh-huh and  so they're you  know he was 
[00:54:00]  gonna release  all this next  week but  they're wondering  why is it  taking so long  because obviously  teo and his  people are trying  to get some  kind of story  together uh-huh  now notre dame's  panicking like  holy fuck we  believed you so  it almost seems  like they're kind  of beating him  to the punch so  they could say  look we we're  starting to get  suspicious i don't  believe for a  second that he  was going to  release all of  this information  of course next  week oh hey  guys by the way  uh all that  stuff was fake  even though you  weren't asking  about it yeah  yeah yeah  right oh boy 
[00:54:30]  because you would  hit the oh  wow i mean if  you weren't  guilty you  would hit the  media with that  immediately yeah  you find out  about that on  december 6th you  wait 20 days to  tell your athletic  director right and  then another one  and then your  timetable is late  january you're  right right  to tell everybody  you come forward  right the fuck  yeah right  guys you're never  going to believe  this i was at the  espies right i got  a phone call because  it looks like i was  catfish you know  why because it 
[00:55:00]  wasn't something that  was just in the  privacy of his  own home and  and he had been  bamboozled but he  kept it very private  and personal if you  find out that this  was some kind of a  hoax being perpetrated  on you and you had  done all those public  things all the  interviews the crying  on the field the  fucking you know  adulation you're  getting yeah yeah  you would be like oh  my god i gotta get  this out immediately  that this was a  fucking hoax i i'm  i'm horrified that  this happened you 
[00:55:30]  don't sit on it  until the college  comes to you with  their investigation  and go oh right  you know what what  a coincidence because  that's exactly what  we found out and  we were gonna release  it next week  yeah unless this guy  is you're incredibly  embarrassed by the  fact that you fell  for some online  how did now i'm not  saying i'm not  believing that he  didn't fall for  now he's in on it  he's in on it  because he never saw  her absolutely  no one would put  up with that how  long was this  relationship with 
[00:56:00]  this girl according  to a couple years  couple years where  he never saw her  through car accidents  and leukemia too  like fuck it like if  you wanted to see a  girl that you would  absolutely see her if  you're in love with  her if she's dying  and when you got like  a like a cool life  happening like you  know he's got he's  gonna want to celebrate  those moments with his  girlfriend right  which would make you  question everything like  what the fuck that she  should be here right  now or i should be  with her there should 
[00:56:30]  have been pictures of  him bedside with her  with leukemia and just  fucking like makes him  look like a complete  asshole right  he's died of leukemia  and he never visited  her if he didn't know  her i mean if he if  this if he didn't know  this was a hoax  you know what add to  our uh checklist yes  yes we're done using  the word if oh yeah  okay because i see i  see that you're writing  if he thought but  yes i'm talking for  the room and i hope  everyone agrees at  this point we're not 
[00:57:00]  using the word no more  f's okay no more f's  at this point i  completely believe he's  all in on this yes  sorry his statement  basically says this was  really embarrassing now  i'm going to prepare for  the nfl draft oh so  leave me a lot less so  could you leave me alone  i mean the jets are  crazy enough to take  him oh yeah i just  want to i just want to  put that out rex ryan  probably loves this yeah  rex ryan loves this  story oh he likes a  good liar he can't  wait to have him on  the yeah on the  practice field yeah 
[00:57:30]  you're just as crazy  as me welcome aboard  this is great and  here's um chapter three  of the story yeah this  is about catfish yes  can you say what you've  seen or what the  investigators saw that  would um some people  you know us who don't  know the whole story  are going to question  whether manti was  behind the hoax what  have you seen that  would that would prove  that that it could not  be the truth well  there are several  things um one is i 
[00:58:00]  would refer all of you  if you're not already  familiar with it with  both the documentary  called catfish the mtv  show which is a  derivative of that  document documentary and  the sort of associated  things you'll find  online and otherwise  doesn't really prove  anything or catfishing  it is a scam probably  revealing my television  watching habits but was  covered by dr phil 
[00:58:30]  extensively recently  oh then it's gonna be  true that follows the  exact arc of this um  and it's perpetrated  with shocking a  frequency for me  shocking as an older  guy who's not not as  versed in the online  world but oh crazy and  it is it is just as  this one an initial  casual engagement a  developing relationship  online he has a jitter  bug phone a subsequent  trauma traffic accident 
[00:59:00]  illness and not  visiting our a death um  and you know as hard as  it is for me to to get my  arms around this there's  apparently some sport in  doing see this fucking  guy panicked until  someone said hey man  there's a catfishing  thing and he went oh  thank god I got  something I'm gonna go  with that angle yes  because he never met 
[00:59:30]  her so that means he  had to be in on the  catfishing yes for  whatever reason he had  to be in on it he  never met her he  catfished himself so  this guy bringing up  catfish as the reason  that he can prove that  this guy didn't make it  up himself right isn't  proof at all no he  might have been inspired  by catfish to do it  himself right this he  catfished the nation  whoa because he made us  all fall in love with his 
[01:00:00]  story  god damn it that's pretty  good he's in on this yes  he's in on well opie if  he's in on this oh no  no no let me refer to  the yeah okay we're done  with this yeah he's in  on this he's in on this  so why can't the  athletic director say  that no one has a  girlfriend that you  never see during tragedy  especially especially  during an illness like  that he's that in love 
[01:00:30]  but he doesn't go see  that to me is the number  one bullshitting item  right there he didn't see  her when she had was  dying of leukemia yet  he's so in love with  her that he can barely  talk he's inspired to  play again it's like a  love story with  absolutely no fucking  love in it and the  clips we're watching  you would assume they  had a a real  relationship having the  sex and what's not  dude you just you  don't play the game  you go fuck this i'm  going to california to 
[01:01:00]  be with the dying  girlfriend or or on  your day off yeah you  know what you know  either way all right  football's pretty  important or you  can't be that stupid  after a while you're  like what the fuck is  this real or not i'm  going out there and i'm  going to fucking figure  this out right or in  doing this and being  able to do it  successfully so that  was one that we sort of  found this external  um guidebook if you  will or platform for  doing this two were the  internal 
[01:01:30]  consistencies right as we  probe probe ask  questions um wanted to  make sure it all lined  up with what we knew  independently the facts as  we understood them we're  very comfortable with the  consistency and how it all  fit together doing a lot  of talking he's not doing  a lot of proving  thirdly our investigators  thirdly um through their  work were able to  discover online chatter  among the perpetrators  chatter perpetrators it's  like terrorism sort of the 
[01:02:00]  ultimate proof of this the  joy they were taking the  sort of casualness with  which among themselves  what chatter um they  were they were referring  to what they had  accomplished  what's that about what  chatter is he talking  about what's that people  were taking um uh were  laughing and having fun  with this i don't know  probably tweets back and  forth or something like  right it's a whole lot of  nonsense all right well we  started the show not  knowing much oh wow yeah  do you feel like you know  i feel like so much more  this guy is a loaded press 
[01:02:30]  conference i can't wait  for his press conference  he's gonna have to break  down and admit he did the  whole fucking thing yeah  and you think he'll do a  press conference or just a  statement a written statement  i hate the statement  probably statement i want  yeah i want a live people  so he could go and hide if  he if he does a press  conference the first  question has to be why did  you say you met her why  did you say she was the  most beautiful right right  right met here was here's  what we're gonna get now  you're saying you never we're  gonna get a statement  wait we definitely have  that on record that he 
[01:03:00]  didn't meet her once no  no that he says he did he  said he met her once in  interviews you know she's  the most beautiful girl i've  ever met yeah yeah i mean he  he claimed he claimed that  they met after a football game  in california before they  were dating yeah here's what  we're gonna get let me here's  what we're gonna get we're  gonna get a statement a  written statement that will  be released to all the news  that will conclude with saying  he is entering some type of  rehab where he will where  yes yes because that's the  only way you fucking get  through these things i think 
[01:03:30]  he tries to keep this going a  little longer why no they're  gonna there because nota  dame is gonna say it's over  johnny like what are you  doing he need knows he needs  to fucking uh uh get into the  nfl and he can't be this crazy  guy so he's gonna he's gonna  have a statement nfl's filled  with crazy guys though so that's  true you know and then he's  gonna go to some type of rehab  like sex fucking addiction or  booze or something there's not  enough people was mormon  questioning him yet you know  for him we are come out and  we are we're all in it's true 
[01:04:00]  we have the facts right here  we do right that is quite a  fact checklist um all right  do you want to review the case  so we're gonna go through our  checklist for the last time  yeah right this is we broke  this down for the last hour and  a half and i think we feel  confident oh very very confident  what's going on here here's the  summation of the case  uh-huh uh his dead girlfriend  doesn't exist meanwhile that on  the list is already out there  even in mainstream media right  yeah however the list goes you  gotta start somewhere exactly  because when we started the  list we didn't even know 
[01:04:30]  right but by the end of this  list we know everything he  might be so much jesus  could figure that one out  god the list is a list he  might be samoan or hawaiian  probably hawaiian long shot  spanish on grandma's side on  dead grandma's side please sure  let me write that on dead  grandma's side be factual about  it yeah uh the internet is a  thing yeah we did learn that  today we think it's a hoax not  the internet of course uh  probably a bit light in the  loafers slash mo also he's most 
[01:05:00]  likely a queeb or a quay but of  course we don't know and  obviously there's nothing wrong  with that obviously now i'm  moving past the gay angle oh  wow i absolutely am do you want  to um amend uh this this i don't  know i mean it's on the list it's  on the list i'm moving past the  the gay angle this guy just  i just love all right he's  crazy and loves attention here's  here's how we should uh do this  then we have probably a bit life  and light and lovers let's change  probably to maybe okay there's a 
[01:05:30]  chance there's a slight chance  sure he's a bit right but it just  shows you when we started this we  didn't know shit exactly now i i feel  like i know a lot more and it's okay  it's not that he's hiding the fact  that he might be gay it's right he  just loves attention sam could you  read that back for for the record um  with the new um yes the problem is  the second sentence uh-huh is also  most likely he's a queeb or a quay 
[01:06:00]  also he's um also there's a small  chance that he okay right yeah i know  i'm out on that whole thing but we got  to keep it in there just for real i was  in on that when we first started this  because if it does break that he is a  queeb or a quay or a mo but he could  light in the loafers we'll look silly if  we don't have it on one or all those  things yes i'm saying now that it has  nothing to do with this story okay i'll  continue the wasn't trying to hide that i  sure here's a guy that loves it just  loves attention i'll continue the list 
[01:06:30]  from that modified fact which is slight  chance he's a bit light in the loafers  slash mo also there's a small chance  that he's a queeb or a quay but of  course we don't know and obviously  there's nothing wrong with that okay  very good uh everyone loves to catfish  sure do a lot of red flags here so many  red flags not as many though uh really  yeah the news media are a bunch of lazy  bums right when he talks we will get  douche chills that should be amended to 
[01:07:00]  we did we do get when he when he talks  we get douche chills we heard him talk  yeah i got some douche chills when he  was giving that interview i certainly  did too what i mean by not as many red  flags now there's a lot of obvious  shit obvious at first we were like  suspicious but now yes yes we're  knocking down those red flags are  turning into facts yes when he talks we  get douche chills yes his grandma is dead  but everyone's grandma dies he's a kook  either way that's him bull that's that  one we're standing by regis must be mad he 
[01:07:30]  must be uh we're done with the word if  no more if and finally he's either a  liar or a complete asshole  uh how about he's either a liar and or  a complete asshole and why isn't cnn  going with that i know you know how they  have that that that shit on the bottom  of the screen yeah can't they at least  say that he's either a liar that should  be in the crawl at the bottom or a  complete that should that should go by  on the crawl on the bottom of the  screen it's either a liar and or a 
[01:08:00]  complete asshole espn is uh let me say  hi to todd todd hey hey this is todd how  are you hey todd hey listen uh espn is  currently running a statement that says  he put out a written statement about this  and that he uh was taken in by this hoax  yeah okay we got all that we're just  looking for updated facts we're so on this 
[01:08:30]  now yeah yeah we started this show  shitty and not knowing much we didn't  know anything now the second in new  detail comes in i could tie it into all  this i feel like after an hour i'm an  expert on this yeah a complete expert  exactly  mm-hmm what if notre dame is in on this  to get the heisman trophy to their  school  no fucking way not after that penn state  shit oh my god right you know all  those uh shenanigans go away after the  penn state thing i think  there's a player who came out on espn 
[01:09:00]  today and said he met her what yeah  there's some arizona cardinal who said  that that he met her and she's definitely  real that's like suze we spent one night  together  i think lance armstrong loves this right  now oh boy does he ever his big  interviews tonight and nobody's gonna  care and this is like what sports story  oh that's the sports story not you  fucking doing roids we don't care this  guy says i have a friend who went to  notre dame and saw teo the day after he 
[01:09:30]  announced she died excuse me partying  with girls  with girls oh that uh puts less of a  chance that he's a bit light in the  loafers mo or quay or queeb no i'm out  on that angle you're totally out just a  slight chance i'm out on that one i like  leaving it there just in case just in  case cover everything you got to say  this list because this list is going to  be yeah i'm going to take a picture of  it and tweet it out to the news media  you should yes yes yes that way they'll  see oh okay we got the facts you know 
[01:10:00]  what i'm going to do that too okay yeah  you should uh put up there um oh uh opie  and anthony yeah yeah opie and anthony's uh  man tied tail investigation yeah what  checklist no you gotta change you gotta put  opie and anthony up there yeah so that  anybody that that shows that are you  gonna print out this uh checklist opie and  anthony print it out so then the picture  will be better we don't have a this isn't 
[01:10:30]  connected to a printer i could email it  oh my god why would it be mad are all  the printers jammed yeah in eric was  complaining about their print i can text  this to you if you want is the printer a  character in his movie that would be  cool maybe that's how he goes back in  time all the printers jam and when they  try to press buttons and fix it there's  some crossing of electronics and he goes  back in uh to the 40s can someone push my  camera button and he goes what happened  to the printer and the guy in the 40s  goes what are you even talking about  what's a printer oh my god oh boy come 
[01:11:00]  on stretch it out there you go speedy it's  gonna be all blurry we hate when you try  to take pictures of text and it's all  blurry we could have just printed it out  you could have taken a picture can't  print it there's no fucking printer yeah  we could have sent it to another  printer oh you could email it to  yourself yeah exactly and then do that  really that's like weird shit no right  email yourself that's crazy paradox it's  crazy it's like the 70 year old guy  emailing his 18 year old self from 2013  about what happened in 1940 and then 
[01:11:30]  what happened i don't know well he won't  tell me why like your printer angle i  don't know you might have something  there she would and i'm gonna like zoom  in on this fucking thing so are we done  with this story i think well for now we've  got this is this is an ongoing  investigation here on the opian anthony  program really we get to the bottom of  things we accomplished more with this  story in in about an hour than the  mainstream media has uh or will in days  okay all right we got the checklist i'm 
[01:12:00]  gonna fucking send that out  wow he's nuts man bat shit fucking crazy  he's a kook either way in bold type yeah  he has to be  tell me the list no one would put up with  that shit and never meet the girl  unless you're a complete asshole right a  liar and or a complete asshole you could  you could skype there's all sorts of  shit there were apparently scheduled 
[01:12:30]  meetings where she never showed  well he knew she was in the hospital he  could have met her there he could  she's gonna fucking get up and run away  with leukemia or being in a coma oh my  gee so the guy from arizona he keeps he  states he knows to go yeah he's saying  that he met her at a party and that and  that the guy uh who we believe created  lanae is actually lanae's cousin so 
[01:13:00]  there is a lanae there's a there's  probably he probably met a girl who  this guy said hey this is lanae who is  probably the girl who you know if if  manti ever spoke on the phone with some  girl probably so there's a picture of  this girl out there so the media is now  gonna find this fucking girl well no  because the the photos of the girl  deadspin already found right is that  girl who who gave uh what's his face 
[01:13:30]  the photos unknowing about the entire  thing the the photos that you see she  has nothing to do with this right it's  just her photos i can't fish but there's  probably a girl who is friends with uh  what's this guy's name ranaia who plays  for the cardinals no no no no what i'm  now i'm confused i know it's very  confusing oh my god do it there's another  checklist there's probably a girl right  who is friends with the guy who created  lanae right who also knows manti right

[01:24:00]  yes  how sick is that  holy mackerel  but she's all tarted  what is she really  yeah  she's got the mind of an infant  of a baby  and the body of a baby  and everything  she just  it doesn't grow  so just make believe you got a baby  that's what they do  they absolutely have a baby  that's just a baby forever  so just make believe it's a baby  yeah  they were even saying that if they  because it looks like a baby  yeah  if a doctor was able to come up with a cure for it 
[01:24:30]  and say all that you have to do is give her this pill  and she'll be like normal  they said  she is normal to us  and we you know  I don't think they do it  because they have a permanent baby  it's like getting a kitten  and it never grows into a cat  I don't think it's the worst thing  everyone loves a good kitten  I mean I  I talk to a lot of parents now  because you know  I've entered fatherhood  a couple years back  and they  they tell me all the time  enjoy these years  they're the best years  yeah  because they're going to turn out to be assholes  mm-hmm  so this parent 
[01:25:00]  will never know that  yeah  changing fucking diapers on a 20-something though  is there a clip there  or do I have to read  I don't feel like  no it's a slideshow  it's just a slideshow  it's just a slideshow  see there's pictures of her with the baby  and then they show pictures of the mother like younger  but it's still with the baby  it's like E-Rock's fucking movie  E-Rock's movie is all around us  that movie is all around us  it's like Benjamin Button's kind of a thing going on there 
[01:25:30]  but they got to continue to buy baby stuff  do they at least like  I guess so  do they update their baby stuff  there's an older picture  but it's still just a dumb baby  look  baby  baby  and just acts like a baby  just acts like a baby  because it's retarded  this is kind of cool  it is weird right  and they call it Syndrome X  because they have no other cases like this  they can't find any genetic problem  it's like undiscovered country in there 
[01:26:00]  girl who doesn't grow  continues to baffle doctors  Brooke Greenberg  weighs 16 pounds  16 pounds  16 pounds  16 pounds is about a  I don't know  help me out there  parents  I wouldn't know  that's like less than a year old  yeah  right  yeah  somewhere around there  or maybe about a year  and stands 2 feet 6 inches tall  she can't walk or talk  but doctors hope she may be the key  to the fountain of youth  oh yeah  little Brooke Greenberg  has shining eyes  that twinkle 
[01:26:30]  when her mother  takes her clothes off  oh no  I mean takes her clothes off  pushing her stroller  through the infant wear department  of their local stores  where Brooke gets her clothes  20 fucking years  of pushing a stroller  holy shit  but Brooke is 20 years old  this year  and she hasn't grown an inch  since she was 4 or 5 years old  wow  she looks like a baby  isn't that crazy  like some of these  she's 20  some of these people  they do look older  but  yeah  but are stuck in kind of like  a baby body  but this one 
[01:27:00]  you would swear  is just a  I don't know  a one year old  one and a half year old  many of the best known names  in medicine  in their experience  they have not seen this before  no  they can't even find another one  like her  nope  you know like the  progeria people  they have like a fucking  convention every year  and get together  yeah  like if you want to meet  a progeria kid  and you're in New York  you fly to London  you meet the other  progeria kid  and then they feel like  alright  cool  yeah yeah  there's more around like us  yeah they feel better 
[01:27:30]  about themselves  the two of them  fly to Japan  you see that guy  right  yeah you go to South Pole  you find the other one  but this  there's only her  say it  progeria kids  they all look exactly the same  yes  they kind of like  wear different hats  or shirts  depending on what they're into  different hat  you know all the hats  are on the last  fucking little snappy thing too  those giant Star Trek  hiney headed aliens  from the menagerie  heads  can we talk about  the greatest  Maury Povich episode  ever  please  primordial dwarves 
[01:28:00]  yeah way before  he decided  I know it's not  the same thing  but it made me  think about it  because now  all he does  is those dumb  pregnancy shows  yeah  but there was a time  he played hide and seek  with the fucking  with primordial dwarves  in his office  there you are  look you're hiding  you're in the garbage  pal  I challenge you  to find a better  episode of Maury Povich  hi  look at you  you're up on the  bookshelf  did you find a clip  from that  that was the best  Maury  ever 
[01:28:30]  ever  even though he had  like the cotton ball  man or whatever  yeah  that shit  10th anniversary show  and it starts now  bringing back  memorable guests  I like that fucking  we didn't do any  show prep show  right  yeah let's do a clip  show I'm hungover  and she was truly  a giant superstar  take a look  at all the appearances  of Hannah  on our show  oh Hannah  the first time we met  Hannah at 4 years old  she was pint-sized  but her personality  was enormous 
[01:29:00]  what do you want to be  when you grow up  happy  do you have a dog  yeah I want  rascal  can you show me  how rascal  wags his tail  Hannah returned to the show  at 5 years old  and she looks the same  with a whole new bag of tricks  what do you got in here  well that's a CD  oh and you want to take a picture of me  okay  why did they give her a perm  right  after our perm 
[01:29:30]  we followed Hannah home  and spent the day with her  from sun up to sundown  oh  she got ready for preschool  what a freaky looking cat  what is she  costume  a primordial dwarf  oh so she could live a full life  on the trampoline  I don't know  well the progen  the third time  Hannah appeared  she brought her friends with her  and put me to work  oh  babysitting  they're all primordial  games  I didn't see  one  two  three  four  where could they be  I mean  Jenna 
[01:30:00]  they're in drawers  they're in the fucking  on the bookshelf  Hannah how are you  Hannah's behind the coffee machine  that was hilarious  wait she grew a little  how old is she  she's not so cute anymore  let's hear her talk  you're in a play  and you play an angel  show me what you do in the play  ouch  sorry  Hannah's acting career  was still going strong 
[01:30:30]  one year later  she's dancing  when she comes out  for a fifth time  have you grown  no  I'm great  you were in the Wizard of Oz  oh I bet  you were in the door  no  no  no  you got your  where did they get the munchkins  they make them out of fucking  hamsters  alright  well it wasn't the  best clip but  and here she is  now  Hannah  oh  Hannah  her 30th appearance  she's now  34 years old  brook is 20 years old 
[01:31:00]  this year  and she hasn't grown  an inch  alright  they can't find  another one like her  because no doctors  have ever been able  to provide a formula  a formal  excuse me  diagnosis  for brook's condition  her condition  has been labeled  like you said  syndrome X  syndrome X  weighing just 16 pounds  she is estimated  to have the mental  capacity of a toddler  Iraq is that the title  of your movie  syndrome X  ooh 
[01:31:30]  no  damn it  right  she has no apparent  abnormalities  really  uh oh  that just brings up  a world of questions  that brings up  a world of horrible  questions again  no gross  chromosome problem  nothing  nothing  nothing out of the  ordinary really  what about snacks  snacks  her Baltimore area  family treats Brooke  like any other child  insisting she does  not need to be cured  if somebody  okay you said all this 
[01:32:00]  yeah  they would not cure her  if they could  no  nonetheless  the baffling nature  of Brooke's condition  has led some researchers  to believe her unique  genetic code  could provide insights  into the aging process  genetics  geneticists  are now  sequencing  Brooke's  genome  in the hopes  that it may  someday lead  to new treatments  for age related  disorders  like Parkinson's  disease  when you get into  genomes  yeah genomes  look out  some scary shit  right  man  so she's 16 pounds 
[01:32:30]  she's 20 years old  and she hasn't developed  at all  like a one or two year old  yeah  and like you said  there's a ton of pictures  of her in that slideshow  she looks exactly the same  year after year  and the pictures are older  like you see the mother  is younger as a mother  but she just stays  exactly the same  that's fucked up  imagine if she was  like just immortal  you just keep  she just keeps going  through life  and she's got to be  passed off to other  people  because she's  like a  stupid turtle  yeah  you buy one of  those dumb turtles  and the next thing 
[01:33:00]  you know  you go to the  280 years old  yeah  her own grandkids  are like  taking care of her  but she's a baby  come here grandma  this could be a great  movie  or aunt maybe  a great movie  I wonder if she  could become pregnant  and have other ones  I don't know  oh sure  I'm willing to do  the experiments  sure  there's no video  clips of her  there's gotta be  a video clip  I wanna see how  she sounds 
[01:33:30]  hear how she sounds  whatever  my god man  I think she's just  like  she can't talk  or walk  yeah but that's all  the stuff you're not  really doing  as a kid  yeah  at that age  how cruel  how fucking cruel  is that  imagine if somewhere  in there that was  a 20 year old mind  just going like  oh my god  help me  help me  I'm in here  I'm in here  they put her in front  of Caillou  day in and day out  just sits there

[01:35:30]  pouring her emotions  out in her own head  she's making  a grumpy face  no I'm not  I wanna get  my driver's license  I wanna do  everything  I wanna go  to a mall  I wanna go  on a date  I wanna go  to the movies  I wanna go  out to dinner  oh  I wanna get  my pussy  finger popped  honey  honey  could you  get her  her baba  she's getting  very angry  oh that's  terrible  yeah  oh man  if there's  a 20 year old  trapped in there 
[01:36:00]  that is  cruel  how do you know  I guess you don't  how do you know for real  oh you got a clip  what show  is she on  Katie  Katie  the fuck's  Katie  alright  that's my  girlfriend  the right  leave her  little  alright  for the last  20 years  Melanie and  Howard Greenberg  have been  caring for  their daughter  Brooke  in a way  that most  other parents  care for  an infant  you know  Brooke  loves to be  held  all she wants  to do is  be held  you gotta pause 
[01:36:30]  this  I have to  stress this  can we put  this on our  Facebook page  20 years old  our audience  doesn't watch  Katie  no  they just  did the big  reveal for this  story  and she walked  out of a room  with this  what's her name  Brooke  Brooke  you would swear  it was an  18 month old  baby  it kind of went  like  meh  holy fuck  meh  Brooke suffers  from a rare  condition  that has stopped  her growth  and development 
[01:37:00]  she's been the  same size  for the past  15 years  oh my god  from one to four  Brooke changed  she got a little  bit bigger  but at four  four to five  she stopped  caring for Brooke  has presented  the Greenbergs  with a set  of demanding  challenges  I just learned  it's been 16  years of  on the job  training  giving her  medicines  knowing when  she's sick  the right amount  the key 
[01:37:30]  with Brooke  is  they put her  in a swingy  chair  she's 20  the Greenbergs  have learned  to adapt  to their  daughter's  condition  in their  own unique  and special  ways  now this is  very old  looking  hey  she's a big  girl  she should  have big  girl clothes  she's 20  oh my god  unusual  circumstances  pause  oh my god  they're in the  they're in the  baby section  trying to find  stuff that  that looks like  big girl clothes  but it's  fucking for  a one year  old  I am so 
[01:38:00]  confused  that's fucked  up  and this  goes back  to my  theory  this is  sideshow  shit  yes  it's the  only reason  this is  on Katie  it's  sideshow  shit  we all  continue  to love  sideshow  shit  but we  can't  we can't  do it  old school  where it's  a dumb  10 and  you pay  your quarter  or 50  cents  so you  do it  now  through  television  and make  believe  you know  there's  an emotional  attachment  right  there is  for her  family  but no  one  else  no  this is  just  pure  ratings  like  this is  pure  like  look at  what  we  found  this is  the tent  that's  got the  big line  in front 
[01:38:30]  of it  with everybody  holding their  nickels out  ready to pay  of course  yeah  if somebody  knocked on  the door  right now  and said  it's a  guaranteed  pill  give this  to Brooke  she'll be  fixed  well first  I would say  to him  she's not  broken  well a little  broken  and B  I would say  thank you  but no  thank you  well you're  a sick  fuck  she has a  wonderful  future  let's keep  pausing  he's a  sick  fuck  that's  crazy  as a 
[01:39:00]  parent  you go  holy  fuck  yes  please  they kind  of  you gotta  think  the kid  is missing  out on a  lot of  stuff  dude  but they  kind  of  dig  this  because  it's  like  they  have  a  permanent  baby  it's  like  I said  it's  like  getting  a  kitten  and then  when  a  kitten  grows  into  a cat  you're  just  kind  of  like  they love  the fact  that this  kid's  been a  baby  for  20  years  20  years  20  years  of pushing  the  stroller  and  you know  some of  the shots  it looks  like  the kid's  a little  off  let's just  say  but then  now I'm  looking at  this video 
[01:39:30]  we stopped  it  and that  looks  just like  a kid  a baby  a baby  it's like  the skin  even  it's not  like  once you  get  like  in your  twenties  like  your skin  doesn't  look like  it did  when you  were  fucking  two  years  old  but it's  the same  thing  and the  same  like  thin  hair  she looks  like  she has  the skin  of a toddler  you're right  it doesn't look  like it has  aged at all  that's fucked  up  you know  what  they should  fucking  hack out  her pituitary  gland  and juice  it  just drink  that  fucking  shit  down  fucking  fountain 
[01:40:00]  of youth  don't take  that idea  for a  screenplay  too  you fuck  would you  pay a million  for a shot  for her  pituitary  gland  yeah  I'd want  the whole  thing  I'd eat  it like  an apple  let's  continue  here  she's here  that's Howard  and our  job  is to make  sure that  she has  a wonderful  future  future  she's in  a swingy  chair  Carly and  Brooke  Greenberg  are here  today  so nice  to meet  you all  thank you  for being  here  pushing  in a  stroller  like  rocking 
[01:40:30]  her  back  and  forth  in  the  stroller  like  they  would  a  baby  I want  to see  how  Katie  handles  this  because  she's  you know  she's  not us  no  she's  not  she's  not us  but we  all  play  on the  same  field  don't we  Katie  don't  we  have  you  react  people  come  up  and  all  that  crap  instead  of  holy  shit  look  what  I'm  looking  at  we  just  tell  everyone  she's  contagious  and  if  you  have  children  it  will  fuck  them  up  too  keeps  them  away  you 
[01:41:00]  both  sound  so  hopeful  about  Brooke  and  about  her  future  and  yet  this  must  have  been  and  continue  to be  such  a  struggle  for  you  as  a  family  and  as  parents  what  has  it  been  like  it  hasn't  been  easy  but  each  day  you  get  better  at  doing  your  job  from  the  beginning  when  she  was  born  we  were  clueless  it  was  really  hard  we  didn't  have  any  answers  and 
[01:41:30]  we  just  took  each  day  as  it  came  but  throughout  the  years  you  become  an  expert  at  the  job  that  you  were  given  really  and  you  in  your  hall  of  mirrors  womb  still  challenging  but  a little  bit  easier  when  all  of  us  because  we're  a  team  a  team  she's  our  child  I  when  people  see  Brooke  and  tell  them  she  is  20  years 
[01:42:00]  old  they  laugh  what  is  the  lying  sack  of  shit  she  was  like  12  years  old  people  say  how  old  is  she  I  said  12  months  and  they  would  accept  that  but  now  today  she's  20  I'm  not  going  to  say  20  months  because  we're  starting  to  she's  20  years  old  in a  stroke  look  at  that  I'm  I'm  speechless  it's  it's  fucking  alien  it's  so  fucked  up  we're  gonna  put  this  on  the  Facebook  page  it  probably  is  up  there  you can  find  it  yourself  20  years  old  and  it  looks  like  a

[01:45:30]  five to  ten  children in  her class  they go  to music  they go  to art  they go  to  um  adaptive  phys ed  she gets  physical  therapy  therapy  I was  gonna leave  her at a  diner  that's a  tough  question  for the  foundlings  but I  figured  she'd  stay  a baby  but how  the fuck  do they  know what  she's  learning  yeah  why  do they  mix it  up just  in case  maybe  she snaps  out of it  one day  hi mom  how you 
[01:46:00]  doing  you can't  be in the  same grade  for 20  years  same grade  the report  card every  year  we're sorry  but we're  gonna have  to hold  your daughter  back another  year  she's gotten  20 of  those  well 15  oh my god  you can't do  that  Jesus Christ  how cruel  it's not like  normal children  she doesn't  you know  spell or  be able to  add two and  two and  things of that  nature  we see  different  changes on  her 
[01:46:30]  of her  noticing us  or communicating  with us  how does  she communicate  by shitting  her pants  she's tired  she'll rub  her eyes  and she'll  she'll you  know kick  and fuss  and want to  go to bed  if she  is wet  she'll let  us know  in her diaper  really like  really like an  infant would  communicate  if she's happy  she giggles  and laughs  she'll let  you know  if she's  unhappy  what about  her period  when did  you first  sense that  Brooke was  not developing 
[01:47:00]  normally  last week  i guess  i guess  a span  of three  years  three  to five  three  to six  Brooke  is my  third  child  so the  milestones  that  you would  normally  hit  with  your  children  she didn't  hit  what was the  last one  normal one  doing in the  womb  fucking  fighting  kicking the  shit out of  her womb  leaving it  like a  fucking  disaster  area  i want  boobies  like my  sister  buy me a  bra  just humor  me  humor me 
[01:47:30]  get me some  victoria's  secret  panties  give me a  bra  put two  plums  in it  i just  want to  feel like  an adult  i'm a  woman  god damn  it  i'm in  here  i'm in  here  i'm in  here  holy  fuckaroni  it's so  fucked up  terrible  she would  always play  catch up  and then  catch up  and she  didn't grow  so a lot  of it was  blamed on  she doesn't 
[01:48:00]  have enough  energy  she's not  big enough  to do  hit those  milestones  and at  first were  doctors trying  to figure out  maybe she  needed no  they just  said go  home give  her an  aspirin  of course  doctors are  trying to  figure it  out  katie  jesus christ  the freaking  anomaly  one-off  it's a  one-off  didn't you  notice when  the doctor  called all  his friends  in to  check it  out  that kid's  a prototype  oh wow  fuck  dumb question  katie  continue  very dumb  was she just  very very  low on the 
[01:48:30]  percentile chart  in terms of  height and  weight in  other words  what were you  being told  early on in  brooks life  she was on a  special growth  hormone that i  gave her every  day that work  out for like  six six to  seven months  so we went to  the doctor and  then six months  later we came  back to the  doctor and i  distinctly remember  her saying well  what happened  why didn't you  give her the  what happened  and i said i  gave it to her  every day  no you  didn't and  she said if  you would 
[01:49:00]  have given  that amount  that you gave  to her to  looks like he  gave the  growth hormones  to himself  ah yeah  looks like he  was taking the  medicine yeah  giving him the  growth hormones  looks a little  thick he said  he would have  been like a  fucking pro  athlete or  something if he  would have been  taking those all  those growth  hormones maybe  he was maybe  he was shooting  him into his  cock that's  right and it  did nothing to  brooke zero  wow she has  been the same  weight the  same height  for now 15 
[01:49:30]  years you at  one point almost  did not want to  have a diagnosis  for brooke i  think in the  beginning we  thought we  wanted a diagnosis  so we could  help because like  any parent she  was not normal  and we wanted  to look at  all right together  on that infant  like it looks  now i don't know  who's normal  her or us  i have a hard  time with that  with the  philosophy i think  she's normal 
[01:50:00]  and she's not  broken there's  nothing to be  shut up i  understand as a  parent you want  to rationalize  this but  fucking a she's  not normal she's  20 and she's a  fucking she's in  a stroller she's  broken she's  broken busted  maybe she's like  fucking new  evolutionary thing  but they're saying  they've never seen  anyone else with  this condition  yeah alien  it's an alien  uh you want  debbie's back  hey debbie  thank god debbie's  back  let's keep doing  the same joke  she didn't get  hopefully she'll  get it the second  time debbie 
[01:50:30]  yeah isn't this  great what were  you trying  you have to have  like the secrets  of life or  something in her  head like it's  just her in her  head right and  that's it it's  just awful and  and i don't know  i feel like it's  even cruel to to  let her live  yeah like she's  thinking the same  thing we are that  she's got a  conscious a  conscience of  of an adult  you know the  consciousness and  and she's stuck  not able to  communicate anything  but childlike 
[01:51:00]  like fucking  beeps and boops  she looks like a  child and she  can't move  the inner monologue  that you guys  have going on  is fucking  hilarious  i just want to  be fucked in the  ass  holy shit  well you sure  took it a little  further than we  were  wow we were  trying to hold  back a little  god  i did say  finger pop though  jesus  i am a woman  so you know  you like it in the  ass debbie  you are  you like it in the  ass debbie  so debbie  you like it in the  keister  it's just awful 
[01:51:30]  that is that's a  cruel cruel joke  if there is a  god  yeah  well  she doesn't look  like she's  suffering at all  i don't know  no she kind of  looks like a  happy little baby  what's creepy is  the more i look  at her on video  there there is an  awareness in her  eyes  yeah yeah  what that is i  don't know  that's called  sadness and  oh and just  giving up  she's just giving 
[01:52:00]  up like well i'm  an adult but i'm  gonna be a baby  forever  i'm gonna be 18  months for the  rest of my life  this is my  personal fucking  my biological  prison that i'm  locked in  right  it is whoever  she was in a  previous life  must have been  i don't know  she's fucking  quaddo  she's just the  worst person  ever  she's sitting  there going  oh great toy  story 3  oh good they  just plopped me  in front of  another fucking  cartoon  this will be  the millionth  viewing  this is really  great  jesus christ  can you put on  lincoln or 
[01:52:30]  something please  i really like  this is a total  side note but  opie i'm so  sad that you're  married because  i really  you're in love  with his wife  are you  no not her  whoa  oh  i don't even  know how to  handle this  oh  that's right  a little boost  for your self  confidence isn't  isn't bad it's  all right  all right  thank you tebby  there you go  have a good day  guys  yeah fuck you  you whore  good old 
[01:53:00]  dandy  dandy  all right let's  see uh  yeah let's  more of this  conclusion of  this interview  how could that  be broken  well so is she  aging internally  at all  oh that's that's  what we're wondering  the only thing that  ages and that grows  with brooke is her  hair and her nails  i have four girls and  i still have one who  has to go to the  beauty shop and get  her nails done  nothing she has  clothes literally 
[01:53:30]  that could be 15  16 years old  um what do you  mean i have  pictures i remember  one time we went  to her pediatrician  oh she can she  gets hand me down  to herself of her  school pictures on  the table and i  said to him can  you put them in  order and he did  not even get a  little game show  even close i can't  even get it i i  can only wait a  minute see her i'm  sorry but this is  just blowing my  mind so they take  a school picture  every year and they  can't figure out 
[01:54:00]  which is from what  year they can't even  figure it out and as  they show you more  and more pictures of  this of this uh freak  freak is the word  you're looking for  freak she it she  looks exactly the  same for the last  15 years that's  crazy and the only  reason she looked  different for the  first five years was  because they did the  growth hormone thing  right so that fucked  her up a little bit  and then soon as  they got her off that  all right then she  she stayed completely  the same that's  fucking is her skin  aging it didn't look  like it dude didn't  look like it this  looks like some 
[01:54:30]  fucking weird thing  that it i guess they  they haven't found  out why so it's not  a pituitary problem  it's not as far as  they know a genetic  thing but but the  brain stopped developing  and nothing else ages or  grows like all of her  internal organs and  everything just stays  the fucking why is  our hair and nails  growing then  interesting hair and  nails well that shit  continues to grow after  you die right i don't  know if that's a rumor  or not but i don't know 
[01:55:00]  wow that's so weird  keep going we're almost  done i see who's with  her in the picture like  i can see carly aging i  can see if that's carly  before braces or after  braces if it's a if it's  in a certain room in the  house and hairstyles does  anyone else or are there  any other children that you  know of or in the world  who have cross-eyed  condition we've been  told that she's the only  one lucky you like  herself don't find the  world now lucky you 
[01:55:30]  you win the lottery you  get something the odds  are more ridiculous than  any lottery in the  entire world and you get  that instead of the  lottery i would i would  be living in a mansion  because i would be  pimping her out yeah  yeah yeah not not in a  sexual way but i would  set up some hurry hurry  hurry hurry ladies and  gentlemen children of all  ages the amazing girl  that doesn't age step  right up step right up  get in here get away  from me kid get bother me 
[01:56:00]  that would be a big get  it would be a big get  yeah in the freak show  world just leave her in a  cage throw food at her  occasionally and look  do we have to be oh  jesus i got you this time  it's him it's him  there he goes i think  that's the one he was  with oh god  the father sounds like 
[01:56:30]  club soda caddy i heard a  little kevin meanie in  there too yeah it's weird  because they'll just keep  getting older and there's  gonna be a point where  they're just fucking  ancient they're gonna have  they're gonna have to  pawn it off on the sister  the sister's gonna be uh  yeah that's with her  yeah that sister's gotta  look and be like  motherfucker man this is  my future there's my  future taking care of  this fucking little lump  of shit my 40 year old  sister that's still a  baby 40 year old baby  sister  oh god i'm so this is 
[01:57:00]  like a a real life  cartoon like the simpsons  have been on for what  30 years wow and they  don't they don't age yeah  yeah she's a little  cartoon cartoon she's  maggie simpson right  maggie simpson there you  go i should have said  that that would have  been easier that was  for you yeah by the way  i don't think many people  know huge simpsons fan  huge what else can we do  with this uh i don't know  if we did it justice uh  it's easy to it's easy to  do the jokes but this is 
[01:57:30]  unbelievable it really is  uh quite a thought of all  the angles um how do they  handle our birthday just one  candle every year yeah she  can't blow her own fucking  candles out and obviously  that fucking birthday wish  shit don't work worth a  fuck so no another year  still this still this size  but they feel like she's a  20 year old so they try to  find toddler clothes that  look like an older person  would wear them yeah yeah  but if she's still a 
[01:58:00]  toddler mentally then why  don't you just keep with  the toddler keep her in  toddler not worry so much  about that wouldn't be  funny if her only thing  that grew were her feet and  she had 20 year old woman  feet on an infant body  well then we go to that  that monster that had  those uh legs that were  they weighed oh i thought  you meant fucking nicole  from morning mashup that  monster that monster with  the giant feet one of my  other favorite stories is  the lady that from the  waist up looks relatively  normal and then has  gigantic oh yeah legs yeah 
[01:58:30]  her big fucking tree trunk  legs that were way over i  don't know i think they  said over 200 pounds on the  legs alone man but she's  uh she's a skinny broad  yeah she's anywhere else  she's slight at the top  she has one of those rare  someone wasn't paying  attention fucking diseases  like a minotaur man yeah  crazy you got diseases and  then you got this weird  right right right just  throws it over the top  craziness and you don't  know doctors dedicating his  life to that there's no 
[01:59:00]  money in that one patient  hey i'm gonna dedicate  myself to a disease that  where i have one patient  do you think uh scientists  are trying to kidnap this  thing oh man they want  to want to dissect that  fucker they want to get  their hands on her  exactly because if this is  happening then it proves  that you can maybe slow  down some of that aging  shit maybe because we we  got an example we're  looking at we're looking  at a person that they they  did a whole montage and  she barely changed in 15  years 15 fucking years so  that means you could you 
[01:59:30]  could turn off some shit in  the human body yeah maybe so  you gotta think that this  thing is gonna be uh if  she isn't aging physically  then there is gotta be a  way to make it so anyone  won't age right or their  you know organs grow or  why are these parents being  selfish they are being  selfish they should cut that  thing open and just let  science deal with it let's  get the uh the aging shit  going yeah the non-aging  shit  i mean she's she's a cream 
[02:00:00]  waiting to happen oh  come on  give the kid to science you  selfish fucks really the  world you know how about the  world how about for yourself  yeah that too you're certainly  aging  take the blood and make a  serum  it's always some serum that  needs to be made just make a  serum  at the institute uh the old gag is  coming in would you  oh god 
[02:00:30]  i don't think so no that's uh  why don't you take a seat over  there  so you're here to see brooke  you've brought condoms and  some zima  all right you want line of the  day  uh this guy delivers it it  will be line of the day it'll  be funnier and better than  anything we do today  let's see if he can pull it  off  marshall in texas marshall  mr marshall  do you think baby wants her  pussy filled  it was said differently on the 
[02:01:00]  screen  screen  that's fucking horrible but on  the screen it just said do you  think baby wants to fuck  baby want to fuck  would your baby want to pussy  filled  but it's a 20 year old  person  yeah  albeit retarded  i mean but it doesn't look  like it's retarded you wouldn't  even fuck a 20 year old that  look 20 that was retarded you  know you can't do that that's  not my thing  no that's definitely not uh 
[02:01:30]  sorry to disappoint everyone  but  not my thing  it's not my thing  um  but  someone's going do you think  it's a hoax  oh she doesn't exist  maybe there's some catfishing  maybe that's it  maybe they like you know got  wigs and all those groovy  clothes from the old days and  just put it all together  or maybe the kid really is  just fucking 18 months old  and they took a bunch of  pictures  that's what i mean  yeah used like instagram  a whole bunch of costumes  yeah yeah put some filters on  sure  yeah maybe it is 
[02:02:00]  yeah it's just like a little  tarted kid or something  we live in a catfish world  we certainly do  right teo  teo  teo  do they have a life expectancy  for her  a million  they said her uh  internal organs aren't  really aging either  so they weren't growing  or growing  i don't know if they're  aging  i will they age by the day  but are they  having the same  biologically  kind of 
[02:02:30]  yeah  breaking down over the  course of the years  i bet you she's gonna live  to 400  imagine if she  does age  but it's so slow  that she'll be like  500 years old  and be 10  years old  and then like  wow  that'd be fucked up  iraq  don't fucking jot down  anything i'm saying  right here  this is my movie  he's getting fucking  scenes for his movie  i know  yes  storyboarding in there  yeah  his new 90 minute movie  is gonna cover 
[02:03:00]  fucking 12 millennium  how many generations  before uh  they say  alright enough of this  thing  right  kill it  just put a rock  over its head  cause i think of my own  like family history  like  all in with my current  family  yeah  all in with my mom  dad and my brothers  and sisters  sure  not so much after that  right  i know my grandma  didn't know my grandpa  and then so then after  that done  for me done  yeah  don't know anything  about him  have no fucking 
[02:03:30]  connection to him  so now you got this  that's just gonna live  forever  150 years from now  they're gonna be like  what the fuck  her parents  all in  they pass on  now she's living  with her sister  and her other siblings  they're gonna be all in  but then they pass on  oh my god  so now her siblings  kids will take care of her  they're just strapping her  in a fucking car seat  in a flying car  i'm tired of this  fucking kid  alright  get the baby  but i'm thinking  i'm thinking  her siblings 
[02:04:00]  kids  kids  that's when they go  look can we put this  thing in a home  enough  enough already  she's 130 years old  and still looks like  a fucking two year old  right  drooling baby  that has the fucking  wealth of first-hand  knowledge of the world  i can't discuss it  help  i know everything  i'm walking  i'm  i'm living history  right  it's all in my head  find a way to get  this information out  you don't have to read 
[02:04:30]  about history on the  internet  i was there  i was there  i saw it  i saw  i saw  let me talk  let me talk  i was around  when the first  black president  was elected  i was there  you don't have to  read about it  it's terrible  little fucker  or maybe she's like  figured out her own  like way to communicate  but we don't  we just don't know it  yet  she just gets to  talk to like leaves  are they studying the  blinking and all that 
[02:05:00]  crap maybe something's  going on  these two just seem like  they're just content  with having a fucking  20 year old baby  around the house  i'd be studying that  shit  i'd be putting  flashlights in the  pupils  yes they're dilating  well i don't know  what that means but  at least i'm doing  something  it does suck to see  your parents uh your  parents your kids get  older  you're kind of like  that you know a  certain age they are  at or they've  accepted it and love  the fact that they  have a perma baby  because part of that  parents you know wish  their kids didn't grow  up so fast  yeah but when do you  finally go all right  enough already 
[02:05:30]  yeah she's 305 they  grow up so fast  look she looks at  least six now  you think they've  been running into  the baby room for  15 years seeing if  a tooth is popping  yeah what happened  did she lose her  teeth and then they  her permanent teeth  came in or not  and and what about  the baby uh duty  does it smell like  uh adult duty now  it's just adult shit  yeah there's fucking  broccoli rob in there  broccoli rob  how many goldfish 
[02:06:00]  you think she's eating  how many cheerios  did she picked up  and shoved in her  dumb face  she holds the world  record for most  goldfish eaten  goldfish  oh god damn  oh wow  yeah  what if she lives to  400 years old  that's yeah  chuck in chicago  no one knows right  what if she lives to  400  at this point  this just brings up  so many questions  i feel like troy 
[02:06:30]  kwan again  when did this story  hit  on katie  and how did katie  find her  yeah  i don't know how  katie found her  but  jesus  uh you could claim  that kid as a baby  on your taxes  every year  oh could you  you think  i would  sure  maybe they could teach  the baby sign language  i bet they've tried  she does a couple things  obviously they said  in that piece  you're just like 
[02:07:00]  say something  communicate  your 20  we got a professor  on the line  oh  yeah we got smarties  that listen to us  andy in rochester  the home of brother wheeze  what's up andy  hey guys  use old  uh use a lot of  in the old days  just checked in here  yeah i have a lab  and uh  we study aging research  this is uh  fascinating  i actually have not  heard of this before  yeah see that's the problem  because of stupid katie  now you scientists  are going to try to  kidnap this thing  oh man  wouldn't you love to  get that in the lab  down there at the institute 
[02:07:30]  what would be the  first thing you do  would you keep her alive  as you're dissecting  the brain  yeah what would you do  would you just squeeze  her real hard  and see what kind of  like uh fluids  uh seep out of her  eye incision  to the fucking chest  what would you do  what would you do  now guys  you're talking to two people  you're talking to  the scientist  who  has to answer  this question  one way  you're talking to  the ona listener  with a sick sense  of humor  circular saw  really wants to  answer this question  top of the skull  top of the skull off  pop it off with a sawzall  what are you doing 
[02:08:00]  i'd look at that  you know  you guys were talking  earlier about  sequencing the genome  that's pretty easy to do  and that's very nice  of course it is  i do it every day  yeah  before the show  yeah  so knowing  i mean  knowing what  genetically  is different  is really  would be  very  interesting to know  yeah  um  i'm still putting  all my  i'm still putting  all my eggs  in the pituitary  glam basket  yeah  i want to fucking  squeeze that thing  i want to  i absolutely want to  run it through  one of those  jack lalane juicers 
[02:08:30]  and i bet you  the parents  are going to be  stubborn  and they're not  going to let  any of you guys  study her  no  well you know  i mean to get  a dna sample  all you really need  to do is get  a cheek swab  so it's not like  you need to do  anything invasive  at all  and you just  fucking put it  under her mouth  she's drooling  all the time  i mean there's  a ton of  questions  that  that  that just  brings up  for example  like  if she  scratches herself  or whatever  does the wound  heal normally  or not  or is it like  fucking  oh man  like wolverine  they heal  like immediately  cool  you know what  that is based 
[02:09:00]  on reality  though  babies heal  it's scary  how quick  they heal  how fast  they heal  from scratches  and stuff  it's really  bizarre  we're looking  at another  picture of  her  and she's  got teeth  i mean so  we know  for example  like in flies  or other  other model  organisms  that you can  make single  genetic changes  and get  huge extensions  of life  you monster  you frankenstein  well the goal  is not to make  people live 
[02:09:30]  forever really  aging research  is really about  improving  quality of life  later on  or preventing  sharing  oh sure  yeah  i'm sure  it won't  be used  for evil  evil  always evil  research  and use it  for evil  they always  go to evil  you had  good intentions  uh huh  but now  we're gonna  have 50 year  old babies  all over the  goddamn place  who needs  that  i don't think  anybody wants  50 year old  babies  nor do they  want 80  year olds  for 100 
[02:10:00]  years  oh well  yeah  oh my  my  god  yeah  if you stumble  on fucking  immortality  in that lab  of yours  you're just  gonna flush  it down  the toity  aren't you  you lying  sack  i know you  guys  use it  for that  evil  crazy  all right  there uh  scientists  get back to  work  get in front  of your  bunsen burner  go fucking  do something  with a beaker  and by the  way if you  get the uh  if you've  discovered the  fountain of youth  don't forget  about your  pals  o and a  give us a

[02:14:30]  jim jeffries  why didn't i get  screeners  uh because uh you  run out of here even  faster than i do  that's quite true  na na na na na na  and speaking of the  devil  oh  mr jeffries  hello boys  how are you jim jeffries  hey good thank you  this sucks now i feel  like i'm talking to a  star on the phone  i know  it's not just jim  jeffries like hanging  out ago now it's a  big fucking star that  is getting uh rave  reviews and all the  papers and i feel  like i have to be on 
[02:15:00]  my best behavior i  know this is jim  jeffries hollywood  star we don't want to  make him mad so he  comes back i hope he  liked the appearance on  our show i won't be  coming in again early  i'll be coming in for  last hour now  he's changing already  used to come for the  whole show  oh boy jim jeffries  jim jeffries i saw  the first two episodes  of legit i got the  first three but i had  a uh i had a good  you don't care where  i had to go all i'm  saying is i saw the  first two and i loved 
[02:15:30]  it  oh really  absolutely loved it  you're a natural i  know you're more or  less playing yourself  but you're a natural  on camera  oh let's face it  this whole acting  stuff's fucking  bullshit  is it  i was really scared  about the whole  acting thing  let's let's let's be  honest it's like it's  fucking what taylor  o'neill was eight or  nine years old when  she won a fucking  oscar  paper moon  everyone goes on  about all this art  and crafts and that  type of stuff  if your occupation  if you can find an 
[02:16:00]  eight or nine year  old who's better at  it than you your  occupation is fucking  shit  yeah you got a point  what about like  remember lines and  stuff  well this is all  this is all bullshit  as well  it's a single  camera shot  so what you do  is you learn  six lines  and then they  move it around  and then they do  someone else's face  and they do  someone else's face  someone else's face  by the end of it  you've done it like  twelve times  you just have to be  filmed last  and then you're fine  and then they set up  for the next shot 
[02:16:30]  you just memorize  your next six lines  that's what you're  doing  i love it  you're just memorizing  six lines at a  time  i just feel like  when you guys go  into this it's like  oh fuck i gotta  remember all this  shit for today  right  but you learn  as you go  i don't even  i don't even have a  script before i show  up  six minutes on  don't say that  he just gets the  script  learns a few lines  runs them out  well uh  we like asking the  artist  uh what's the show  about in your words 
[02:17:00]  sir jim jeffries  jim jeffries  uh this show  the first few episodes  are about getting a  guy with muscular  dystrophy weight  um but uh the  rest of the season  is not that  it's mostly  it's mostly just  my stand-up stories  uh dramatized um  and a bit funny  wait a minute  hold on hold on  the story uh arc  with the muscular  dystrophy uh pal  there that i so  that's not gonna be  the whole season  no no no no  oh okay  he's there the  whole season  he's there the  whole season 
[02:17:30]  and there's  different things  um that go on  um but the  the you know  the the stories  are based around  other people  you know he gets  the first few  episodes and then  like i think  episode four is  me fighting over  an armrest on  an airplane  um and then  episode five we  did a break-in  which i once  told on i  never told on  stage but i  once told on  your show  all right  all right  the fucking  harrowing story  of the break-in  yes  yeah we do  we do a lot 
[02:18:00]  more cartoony  version of that  it was scary  when we did it  no no i'm sure  on the show  it's not as  scary as it was  in real life  people will be  watching going  that must have  been hilarious  no kidding  i gotta i gotta  ask you about um  i think his name's  rodney in the show  right or is it  it's rodney not  ronnie yeah  rodney yeah  rodney is he uh  a little slow in  real life  he's mentally  challenged  okay  okay all right  because you never  know but uh  this is the weird 
[02:18:30]  thing when you  when you have one  disabled character  like the one  dj's playing you  gotta populate the  world a little bit  right right  so so in one episode  we have it set  there's an agency  that has disabled  actors and uh in  one episode we had  uh an episode where  i went and visited  them all in the home  and helped out to do  some community service  and uh i i go i go  to the home so we  we rang up the agency  and went just give us  all of them  it's all of them 
[02:19:00]  and he said he said  well i said i want  the whole flock  what is it a murder  murder  we had we had about  five down syndrome  three cerebral palsy  a couple of people  who obviously the  umbilical cord  caught around their  neck  you collect them  all  they didn't have  enough wranglers  to take care of  all of them at once  holy shit i'm telling  you this show is 
[02:19:30]  definitely going to do  very well man  holy shit man  uh also jim i i heard  uh my my my ex  auditioned for your  show  she she came in  it was funny because  he came in because  i knew her very  vaguely  off uh off uh  facebook  i'm friends with  you and you know  you know how you  get that weird thing  where you look at  other people's  holiday snaps  yeah  then you then you  meet them and  you're like oh  how was cancun  yeah  so she she comes 
[02:20:00]  in and uh  and i go oh  yeah we're i'm  friends with your  boyfriend anthony  and i was it was  only a small part i  was about to give it  to her and then she  went oh we're not  going out anymore  and i was like oh  well i better not  bloody cast you  then  i said oh that's  that's a shame i  said i hope  everything ended  all right and she  goes uh evidently i  became too old for  him and i went well  that'll happen 
[02:20:30]  she just became too  much of a cunt  age age had nothing  to do with it  she had a birthday  and turned cunt  years old  oh that's hilarious  she would have  gotten the part  she would have  gotten the part  it was only for  about five lines  it's nice little  resume stuffer though  all right  good work jim i like  the way you think  and then you got the 
[02:21:00]  uh you got the uh  the broad from uh the  austin powers movies  well we got we got  uh yeah we got  minnie sterling and  we got john rat  john ratzenberg plays  the uh the dad  now how did you get  that from our show  because we know you're  a giant john ratzenberg  fan and we just  asked him it's the  cool thing about  ratzenberg is like  you know i  here we go you  just wind him up and  let him go you know  he he he's basically 
[02:21:30]  cliff that guy  yeah he's not far  removed from cliff  someone would just be  sitting next to him in  like makeup and he'll  go hey you know that  uh jesus had a dog  named tippy  yeah yeah yeah  yeah follow him out  in the water and the  poor thing drowned  yeah he's a little  bit but it's also  he's a real big  republican guy and  he he'll he'll just  he'll we'll say  let's ad-lib a scene  right and you'll be 
[02:22:00]  ad-libbing a scene  and somehow he'll just  work in that hillary  clinton's a whore  just into any bit of  dialogue just ad-libbing  yeah he works his own  agenda in there  that's cool that's so  fucking cool for you  though like you've been  a giant ratzenberger  fan a ratzenberger fan  since uh you know he  was in star wars i guess  yeah yeah yeah we um  no that's really cool  sometimes i get i get  very excited just acting  with him yeah i think  he's i think he's  definitely we've also  got uh marlon waynes  comes in for the final  episode and we've got  uh verne froyer we 
[02:22:30]  got annie dick for one  week of being sober um  i think just before or  after he fell off the  wagon i'm not sure what  week we got him but he  was all right he had  about five carers around  oh my god  um you know we we  have a lot of people  in for this one episode  but hopefully the next  season if it if it does  well then we'll uh  then we'll get some you  know i can't i can't  see uh this not doing  well jim how do how do  they treat you over there  they let you pretty much 
[02:23:00]  uh oh fuck yeah get away  with a lot of stuff you  want they're pretty edgy  i'm not on the louis deal  you know but i'm not i'm  i'm not on louis i'm not  louis ck either they don't  just trust me to go off and  make a tv show and hand it  to them yeah yeah i don't  know how you got that  fucking deal good for him  but uh you know for the most  part yeah they're pretty good  it's weird like on fx there's  only like two things you  can't do and that's like say  cunt and fuck you know and 
[02:23:30]  that that limits me a little  bit but i'm kind of happy  that i'm not making a tv show  on f on on hbo because all  the reviews have been how  sweet the show is and how  it's edgy but it's got a  nice part not to that if i  was left to my own devices on  hbo i would just be like all  right naked girl say the  word comfortable yeah that  uh yeah yeah fx is uh pretty  good though i mean as far as  storylines go and stuff though  you uh you know you pretty 
[02:24:00]  much have have free reign  yeah yeah i've got i've got  you know most of it's you  know eight of them are  stand-up stories and then  the other stories are  sorry and the other stories  are um just ones that were  written to link you know  all those other stories  together but um you know  season three will be tricky  for me when i'm completely  out of town oh shit out of  fucking shit we did uh we  did uh what was it um we 
[02:24:30]  gave them like sort of 17  storylines and they picked  they picked i think the 13  ones we could afford to make  so you have a couple more in  the hole in case you need  them and then you're gonna  have to start going to like  just blatantly ripping off  three's company episodes  yeah yeah exactly  oh look there's a  miscommunication  about sitcoms now it's it's uh  a lot of three company model  is basically ruined because  people have mobile phones 
[02:25:00]  you know it used to be and  even in friends every now and  again they just went they just  went all right no one has a  mobile phone in this world  what i gotta get to joey and  tell him what's wrong didn't  he get my message right  there's some miscommunication  or misunderstanding or missed  message uh and that was  pretty much the plot line of  every sitcom until that  fucking cell phone came out  yeah yeah and now it's like  i'll just text him  glad that's been inverted  glad i can't use that 
[02:25:30]  storyline uh what if not  now jim i jim i've uh had  the extreme pleasure of  spending uh a couple of times  out on the town partying with  jim jeffries uh you you do  know how to party hard my  friend have you had to reign it  back uh when while you're you  know i've got i've got i've got a  baby at the moment uh at the  moment oh at the moment at the  moment and in a way i love it  yeah um i i no i have a i 
[02:26:00]  have a little son and um so  i'm i'm i'm trying to reign in  a bit and also i was working  sort of 60 70 hour weeks on  the show so uh yeah obviously  i'm not yawning it's very  sleepy as much as i used to you  know yeah i'll work on that  well the kids the kids uh it's  that weird thing that having a  child and i feel you look i  think you'll agree with me it's  people carry on about this  whole you'll never sleep you're 
[02:26:30]  going to be awake you'll never  ever sleep it's a good sort of  tired you know it's all right i  don't agree with you i want some  fucking sleep it's a lot easier than  a coke habit it's a different kind  of yeah tired there's a reason why  you're not sleeping a positive  reason is what you're saying  if you've gone through having a  coke habit then having a baby is a  piece of piss and the baby mama  worked on the show right she worked  she was the prostitute the pilot oh 
[02:27:00]  in the first which one was she she  was the one that actually slept with  billy no kidding yeah yeah left it in  once that's jim jeffrey's baby mama  left it in once yeah no kidding that's  that the pilot was great and uh yeah  she was the prostitute and that yeah  she was she was will farrell's wife in  semi-pro oh okay i remember that i  saw anyway and and and are you uh uh

[02:30:30]  what if it what are two high scoring  close games but let's say by everything  you would want in a football game i know  some of these purists love the good  defensive battle let's say there was an  opera on channel 13 and it was a really  good opera opera and someone's going but  obi it's a great opera you'd be like but  i don't care well you tricked a lot of  people for many years i thought you were  like a casual watcher i am very if the  jets or the giants are playing i will

[02:33:30]  looking down at his paper he doesn't  know anybody yeah that's why i said  brady's name three or four times because  i think that's the only one he knows and  then he looked down to pick out another  name and then the third name he picked  out he fucked up  so now i'll start the clip again that  i needed a setup  wilfork  i'm sorry  let me go back further  mm-hmm  wilfork  and steven ridley i mean another great  guy  ridley scott  wilcock  wilfork

[02:34:30]  you're the mayor  yeah well  grok  over and over again with this guy  it's it's it never ends with uh menino  mm-mm  the maya  you see the ads for uh  salvi  i guess that's gonna be on a and a  new show salvi  bunch of fucking cocksuckers  that's gonna be good  yeah doesn't that look uh  that chick uh  what is that jen i think her name is  on the show  she's pretty uh hot  how does eric know about this show  eric comment  they run it  every break during the storage wars 
[02:35:00]  marathons  that's southeast  oh you're a big storage wars fan  i i was  i'm now  losing it  thanks to the new york series  i was watching uh  such a crappy show  uh  last night  all right  he rock  he rock  you still got something to do today  oh but that was a great fucking opportunity  just  to make up  just fun  just for fun  just for fun  funsies  you're not into funsies 
[02:35:30]  oh god  what was this show  the show was  barter kings  what is barter kings  this is a show  it's like all the other ones  yeah  yeah  yes  aren't they running out of fucking  they're running out of shows  to make fake shows out of  it's two guys right  and they fucking start off  they they trade things  that's what it is  it's like a pawn thing  but without money  they trade  they barter  so they'll be like  all right  our goal today  is to get an airplane  we're gonna buy a twenty thousand dollar airplane  and we're gonna start out 
[02:36:00]  with a fucking  like a scuba equipment  like an aqua lung  and a regulator  and a suit  okay  for like three hundred bucks  so they got three hundred bucks  that they want to basically  turn into twenty thousand  right  and then they trade up  so they like  traded it for a kayak  and then they trade  the kayak  for something  well they  they trade a guy  the scuba equipment  for the kayak  but where do they find these guys  ah exactly  they go online  on craigslist and stuff  and find someone  that wants  scuba equipment  okay 
[02:36:30]  or wants like  yeah  and see what they have to trade  like they go to barter sites  and see  and then  and then they trade  but it's always the same fucking thing  they go  and the guy goes like  ah that equipment's pretty beat up  I'm pretty  you know  I like this kayak that I have  and your scuba equipment's beat up  and I  I don't think so  no  no  and then they  they show the guys go like  oh  with each other  like oh we're gonna have to really work this one  and they go  look  you're just gonna put the kayak in the garage  you're a scuba dive guy  you want a scuba dive  it's fun to do 
[02:37:00]  and you enjoy it  well why don't you do it  hmm  okay  and then they  they make the deal  and that's  every  single  time  they say no  there's absolutely no way  I'm making this trade  and then they trade  so  yeah  because they gotta get the airplane  by the end of the episode  yes  the show's a waste of time  they always get what they're looking for  by the end of the episode  is it fake  it's  so fake  it's  so  so they're just writing it in such a way  like okay  you're gonna say it's beat up  but then we're gonna twist this  and eventually  they're actors 
[02:37:30]  they're bad actors  so now they got the kayak  what was the next  uh  the next one from the kayak  might have been  I might be skipping a step  but it might have been  um  one of those signs  you see on the side of the highway  that blink and arrow  blink  blink  to divert traffic  right  so then they went to  um  a carnival  is  is our finance guy  trying out to be a villain  in a superhero movie  uh oh  I missed him  go walk over there  please  okay  just say hi

[02:42:30]  move  give the people out there  one tip  from your world  one tip from my world  is if you have debt  pay it down  wow  you've told us never  to pay down our debt  now we're paying down  our debt  no not  I'm not talking about  your mortgage  but credit card debt  credit card debt  get rid of it  right  now without any specifics  are you optimistic  about the future  or pessimistic  about the future  well I feel better  now that we passed  Nostradamus Day  alright that's good 
[02:43:00]  I mean the economic  future by the way  if Congress can get  through this  boring  ceiling thing  then I'll feel okay  right  that's the one  where they could  kill the world  as we know it  yeah we've only  gotten through  the point where  he starts his taxing  of people  I love the reaction  of the people  on Twitter  that are like  hey wait a minute  I don't make  $250,000 a year  I make a lot less  than that  yet I got my paycheck 
[02:43:30]  and there's more  taken out  than there was  last week  what happened  and they don't  understand  that everybody  took a hit  but that wasn't  highly publicized  was it  no actually  lower income  people take a  bigger hit right  now  right  because the  social security  tax that was  4.2% last year  yeah  is now 6.2  so they  this is going  great  2%  yes  it's a bigger deal  right  right  exactly  and yeah 
[02:44:00]  they didn't know  that was happening  those hard working  middle class people  yeah  we have to protect  we have to protect  them  and of course  the lower class  people that  we have to help  lift up  we're lifting them  okay  fuck it  what's next  Jesus  well  so  that was terrific  well it was  I like  I like getting  a little info  like that  a little economic  info  and uh  Tuesday  Tuesday at 1  we will discuss  a lot more  Barry do you like  sex  what  oh I'm just  doing a segue  oh you're reading  the uh

[02:45:30]  up getting it  they get what  they're looking  for every week  every day  or the show  doesn't work  whatever it is  or it doesn't  work  right  and it's  terrible  it's the same  exact thing  it's bad  actors  this is um  uh uh  barter kings  it's called  on a and a  and it's like  everything else  and then i turned  on that  why do they have  to do fake  shows  i don't know  it seems like  there's enough  good ideas out  there  there's that  other show  the uh  fucking one  with the biker  bar  that they um  put on  every year  i really don't  know  from um  barry do you  know  what's the biker  bar show  people on pal 
[02:46:00]  talk  hold on  it's almost  their full  throttle saloon  for the full  throttle  and it's like  all they have  is like  maybe a couple  weeks or  something  where they  have the  Sturgis  big biker  festival  and everything  like that  and it  fills up  and they  gotta make  all their  money  in this  two weeks  out of  for the  whole  fucking  year  so they  have  these  big  parties  and everything  like that  and that  if you  just took  a camera  and documented  it would  be great  but they  gotta fill  it up  with 90%  of this  fake  scripted  shit  you mean  to tell  me you  can't get  a half  an hour  a week 
[02:46:30]  of action  from a  biker  bar  in the middle  of the desert  that's a  no brainer  but they  fill it up  with horrible  scripted  shit  in the middle  of the desert  of course  yes  because they're  lazy  they don't  want to  spend the  time  waiting for  the real  shit  to happen  terrible  they do  that  assisted  reality  I can't  stand it  it all  sucks  it's all  very weak  assisted  reality  means fake  yeah  I didn't  come up  with that  assisted  reality  that's the  world I live  in

[02:51:30]  gray  but he did have  the horseshoe  bulb  like really  but he is a  jit  oh but he  you know what  he had the look  of an accountant  I think the horseshoe  works a little better  on the jit  he had the look  of an accountant  when you're an  accountant  you're supposed  to have that hair  right  when you know  he's not a  fucking ultimate  fighter  it's crazy  he ultimately  fights though  for our money  Opie  for our money  true  yes  oh he'll talk  your ear off  too  holy fuck  he's a UFC  and the C  means cash 
[02:52:00]  we gotta say  the Bubba Ray  Dudley for tomorrow  okay  wait a minute  who's Bubba Ray  Dudley  don't put it on  your show  who's Bubba Ray  Dudley  give him a taste  on my show  don't do  any of that  taste shit  we'll do it  tomorrow  I promise  and if we  don't do it  when does he  fight  tonight though  yeah  I gotta  I'm gonna  give him  a little  taste  a tiny  taste  should I  give him  a little  taste  or maybe  I'll just  plug it  give you  a taste  of a  fucking  hollow  point  I'm surprised  oh wait  they're gonna  take my  guns  holy shit  wait a minute  I can't  say that  you can't  act crazy  no I  can't  act  crazy  we should 
[02:52:30]  have done  the audio  today  I guess  we were  busy  with the  the thing  that doesn't  age  yeah  you could  mention that  his show  is on  Spike TV  I don't  care about  plug  I know  you don't  but  Bubba  probably  would like  that  bully  bully  bully  bully  Ray  is  marrying  Brooke  Hogan  tonight  at 8  so is  bully  Bubba  Ray  Dudley  so it's  gonna be  Brooke  Ray  I  can't  be  Brooke  Dudley  I asked  him if  he was  gonna  change  his name  to  Bully  Ray  Hogan  oh shit  that's  probably  an insult 
[02:53:00]  but what  is Brooke  changing  a name  too  Ray  is it  Brooke  Hogan  Ray  Brooke  Hogan  Ray  I guess  no it's  not  well not yet  no because  he's getting  married at  8 o'clock  sure he is  tonight  why is the  mainstream media  talking about  this  this is a  big story  Paul Hogan's  daughter getting  married would  be a story  because he  works for TNA  instead of  WWE  and maybe  they don't  have their  publicity shit  together like  Vince does  here's  one of the 
[02:53:30]  runner up  lines of the  day  pigment is  like when  you give  Iraq a  cert  see a  pig mint  oh  now I get  it  but it  made it  so  of course  oh okay  I didn't  get it  before  you didn't  nope  oh Sam  you won't  because he's  big fat  like a pig  right  and if you  had a  mint  like a  sloppy  dirty  pig  it'd be  a giant  fat  disgusting  pig  mint  yeah  a mint  for a  big fat  disgusting  obese  living in  his own  shit  he ain't 
[02:54:00]  taking no  shit  yeah we  get it  here's another  runner up line  of the day  I want to go  on a date  I want to go  to the movies  I want to go  out to dinner  oh I want to  get my pussy  finger popped  you did go  there  oh OB  oh now  she's just  a little  thing  oh now  yuck  everything 
[02:54:30]  everything  you guys  watched American  Idol last night  hell no  that show's  so done  it's played  yo  can I tell  you something  you know  they've been  talking about  this Nicki  Minaj  Mariah Carey  beef  that stems  from that  show  oh yeah  huge  I am more  convinced that  Brooke Hogan  is marrying  Bully Ray  than I am  that that is  a legitimate  beef  oh really  really  couldn't be  faker  that thing  why are they  like smirking  at each other  and the whole  time they're  like making  these little  comments and  rolling their  eyes at each 
[02:55:00]  other and  being like  but you can  tell  it's not  based on  anything  you  douchey  douchey  wow American Idol  jumped the shark  huh  big time  what's the  bigger loss  last year  I think with  Alan  Hulk Hogan's  the daughter  getting married  I thought that  was a lie  well I think  it is  the fight  on American Idol  or the football  player's dead  imaginary girlfriend  I think if only  one of those  three were false  yeah  Nicki Minaj  Mariah Carey  wow  really 
[02:55:30]  it's so fake  wow  I think when  Ellen  remember when  Ellen was a  judge for one  season  I swear to you  I just remembered  yeah  when you said  Ellen a little  while ago  I was so  confused  I forgot  she was a  judge  why didn't  they bring  her back  I think  that was  the jump  the shark  for the show  I think  that was  the jump  the shark  for all  of those  shows  actually  so  they were  hoping for  a lot  more from  Ellen  and they  didn't get  it  yeah  because  that's  when they  started  focusing  on the  judge  instead of  the contestants  and people  stopped caring  about the  contestants  there you 
[02:56:00]  go  Ellen  DeGeneres  is really  fucking  funny  really  I really  think so  I don't  know if  our audience  would agree  but  I bet  they  wouldn't  really  I'm betting  on that  man  so  maybe that's  not a popular  thing to say  but she cracks  me up  do you laugh  when she dances  down the aisle  trust me  there's a lot  of horse shit  the show is on  in my house  at times  and there's a lot  of horse shit  at times  somehow the remote  falls  I'm not playing  that game  I don't play 
[02:56:30]  that game  like these idiots  do  my wife  puts it on  and do I  watch  yes  do I watch  the whole thing  no  the game's on  do I  think there's  a lot of  horse shit  involved with  her show  yes  but I think  in general  she's very  fucking funny  naturally funny  you ever been  watching her  for daytime TV  instead of  Ellen  the Jeff Probst  show  no  holy shit  what a debacle  that fucking  hunk of shit  is  that man  is incapable  of first of all 
[02:57:00]  booking a guest  that anyone  would give a shit  about  secondly  speaking to that  who gives a shit  guest  and they committed  to him  oh wow  are they ever  that's a bomber  are they ever  they had  fucking  what's her name  Lisa Welch  the one from  fucking  facts of life  she was on  the other day  who gives a shit  she's a survivor  that's why  oh okay  by the way  we should have  talked about  buffing the hair  a little more  or the head  buffing the head  because the radio  wizard just walked  by  he's a buffer  is he a buffer  and if I was  bald  I wouldn't 
[02:57:30]  buff  because then  people  it calls attention  to the fact  you're bald  people start  writing songs  look he buffs  look how shiny  his head is  why is my voice  getting on  oh he is  kind of shiny  have you seen  Steve Harvey  oh wow  is that  dude  you buff  you want me  to go ask him  yeah ask him  if he buffs  we don't need  him in studio  dude the top  of his head  literally looks  like you know  alien  the adult alien  from the alien  movies  it's got that  big head  it's shiny  like that 
[02:58:00]  isn't it  it's shiny  why does he  lotions probably  why does he  shine his head  he's saying he  doesn't  because I think  you're not  supposed to admit  you're buff  you'll be baldest  he's saying he  doesn't  he's such a liar  he's saying that  the shine  is a natural  sweat caused  by your show  oh  maybe it's just  a natural occurrence  that if it's  shiny on the outside  it's very dull  on the inside  he obviously  buffs  yeah  you can't get  your head  that shiny  no  it's creepy  shiny 
[02:58:30]  look  it's like  that is  it's like a bowling ball  he's got some stubble  on the top though  if you look real close  really  some wispy stubble  is going on  right up top  oh is it  yeah  that is like  buff to a high sheen  we got two baldies  out there  one looks good bald  the other one  looks horrendous  which one looks good  though  I would say  that Radio Wizard  doesn't look bad  as a bald guy  but he looks like  the sidekick  of an evil genius  and Barry looks horrendous  he's just out there  with no idea  horrendous 
[02:59:00]  he looks horrendous  wow  oh is that mean  it's just like  you said  bulbous  yeah yeah  it is very bulbous  and then it just  makes his nose  look bigger  there are people  that can absolutely  wear fucking  no hair  Joe Rogan's one of them  Joe Rogan  shaved his head  he looks like  a fucking man  and then you get  people that  ah they can't  quite pull it off  no  Barry  Barry  Barry should  grow his hair  back  and usually  people that  are a little  more hefty 
[02:59:30]  than others  can pull off  the shaved head  more so than  the skinny guy  you're being nice  oh Jesus  fucking Barry  look I don't  want him fucking  screwing up my  books on Tuesday  who cares  we're screwed  already  we have any more  runner ups  one more  oh  did any of this  little back and  forth we just did  would that have  made it  not at all  fuck  not even the pig  stuff  I like that  remember that  pig mint  it was a mint  for a giant  sloth like  lazy bum  fat fucking 
[03:00:00]  piece of shit  pig  and he just sits  in his own shit  all day  right right  he's just fucking  yeah  in his shit  yeah  really  just eating a mint  that's kind of weird  pig mint  hilarious  very funny  TBS  I actually got to do that  TBS  very funny  I forgot to do that  when you were out in LA  are you going to pop up  like in a corner  like in the other TBS  I might pop up in a corner  are you going to nod your head  at the camera  and then fold your arms  there was a lot of us though  they make them all dance

[03:09:00]  who else  Sanjay Gupta  oh the fucking  doctor from CNN  what's he gonna talk about  he has a new series  he's not an actor  he has a new series  did he say doctor  he sounded like actor  what's his new show  the series  it's about the  doctors  that's what it's called  the series  it's called the series  that's crazy  that's the series  by the way  I don't think  there's a name of it  oh my god  by the way  I want to point out  how boring Barry is  yeah  this is the only reason  we're still on the air  oh my god  I'm delaying my meeting 
[03:09:30]  with Barry  walking out there  yeah  yeah I gotta talk to him  that's hours by the way  of fucking  just boredom  oh no  hours  he said yes to Sarah  I know  what  nothing  I didn't say yes to anyone  no you guys didn't  Sam did  she's really good too  we should say  we don't want it  on the after show  that's right  because still on  isn't coming on  Sunday show  I know  we don't want it  on any show  you do on this channel  I'll do it on Raw Dog  that's fine  it'll be a special  alright who else  that's all 
[03:10:00]  who's the  what's the Gupta guy about  him and David E. Kelly  has a new  discuss the series  it's kind of boring  on CNN  you find it to be boring  a little bit  but if you have  elements  you can look at it  and go  whoa shit  fuck Sanjay Gupta  no  can we just do that  with Dr. Steve  he said if we have  elements  he'll look at them  elements  oh I know what he's saying  I know what word he's saying  alright let's go around the room  I already know what word  you know what word  he's trying to say  but he said elements  elements  elements  he goes if you have elements  he'll look at them 
[03:10:30]  elements  ailments is right  ailments  he goes if you have elements  he'll look at them  yeah it says  if your butthole hurts  he'll go  you're okay  if your element is  your butthole hurts  if you have elements  elements  I've been stricken  with an element  man  That's a Spanish mint, by the way.  Would any of this have made the line of the day, which is not line of the day anymore, but we call it line of the day?  You're not coming.  Fuck!  You know why I wouldn't have made line of the day?  Because by this time he's zoned out. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I know.  Oh, he gave up at fucking six o'clock.  Right.  He's not listening.  When did he give up today?  I know you start the day all ready to go.  I think when pigment started coming to the discussion.  Well, you get it, right?  See what it means?  Roland, are you in a tough spot because we just said no to a lot of guys?  You didn't say no to Gupta.  Yes.  No.  I'll think about the Gupta.  He's one of the Forbes most tent-influential people. 
[03:11:30]  Tent-fluential?  I don't even know what...  What's a tent-fluential?  Is that an element you can be stricken with?  Is that a form of the flu?  Tent-fluential flu.  Yeah.  Sanjay Gupta did go to Iraq during the opening volley in the second Iraq war and was there  to cover the news, but then became part of the story when he played doctor and fixed 
[03:12:00]  or treated a child for a head wound.  Ah, shit.  And did Patch Adams.  Oh, and he was one of those guys?  Yes.  He wasn't supposed to jump in.  Ah, good for him!  Ah, good!  Good for you!  Oh, was he one of those guys?  Yes.  That's terrific.  He came from in front of the camera and just got on that operating table and gave some of  his surgical prowess.  I want to promote Mentality Mag on Twitter. 
[03:12:30]  He's got pictures of the broad we said no to.  Oh.  And he's got a really pretty good website there.  Noice.  So, uh, Mentality Mag, one word, it gets the plug today.  Very good.  Anything else rolling?  Um, we could get sandwiches for tomorrow.  From who?  That was not a no on Gupta, by the way.  I'm keeping track.  And what about the sauce guys and the meatball guys?  Do I get more of that stuff soon?  Well, if you start saying more no's, I don't know.  If you start saying more no's, all right, I'll start saying more no's. 
[03:13:00]  No problem.  I think the more no's you say, the less.  Oh, oh.  No.  No.  Yes.  Anyone else?  Looks like E-Rock says yes a lot.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, E-Rock.  You get that right, E-Rock?  Poor little pigment.  A lot of sandwiches in there.  Sang-  Tomorrow we'll have sandwiches.  Uh, anyone else, um, comment?  That's about it.  Comment?  No?  No.  No.  Can I, can I buy a breakfast for everyone tomorrow?  Wow. 
[03:13:30]  You got a good breakfast place?  Oh, when?  But breakfast is just eggs and sausages.  Raffle the eggs and sausages?  What happened?  Only one person is going to get it.  What, we can't all eat?  No.  We're raffling them off so we can make your money back on the breakfast.  That's exactly what I heard.  What did you say?  Eggs and sausages.  No, it was before that, though.  It was a raffle.  It was a raffle.  Raffle me.  You would raffle them.  What did you say again?  Eggs and sausages.  Okay.  Eggs and sausages.  Eggs and sausages.  Eggs and sausages. 
[03:14:00]  We're doing breakfast tomorrow?  Nice.  Well, not if we got a raffle off the eggs and sausages.  I know.  I'm going to talk to Roman about that.  Can we keep the pancakes to ourselves?  Oh, I hope so.  I love pancakes.  And waffles.  I like, I like a good French toast, too.  On-  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Oh, you want crunchy French toast?  How do they make it crunchy?  They crystallize the sugar?  No, the frosted flakes.  They dip in a yolk.  Oh, I hate when they add cereal to shit.  I tell the waitress, I go, I want some hollabread, girl. 
[03:14:30]  I want some hollabread, girl.  And then she brings it.  We all laugh.  That's pretty good.  It is good.  Are you a fan when they use cereal for breadcrumbs?  I hate that shit.  It's delicious.  Stop.  No, it isn't.  It's stupid.  It's good.  It's cheap.  Oh, you crunch up frosted flakes.  And you put it on-  No.  It's our Captain Crunch chicken wings.  Ah, stop it.  It's delicious.  I don't mind potato chip chicken, though.  It's stupid shit.  What?  Potato chip chicken?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wait.  All right.  Wait a minute.  That's not a cereal. 
[03:15:00]  So I'm still in.  What's that?  Have you tried?  What's that?  No.  What's that?  Potato chip what?  Chicken.  What's that?  What's that?  Really?  Yeah, you fry it in-  Potato chips.  Potato chips.  I'll leave it alone.  Instead of breading, yeah.  Holy fuckballs.  It's really good.  I don't like the taste.  That sounds good.  You put it in some milk and then in some crumbs.  Could you do a little buffalo wing sauce, too?  Yeah.  Why don't you?  Really?  And you can use buffalo barbecue chips and then throw some wing sauce on there. 
[03:15:30]  Ooh.  Yeah, because they're salty.  A lot of flavors.  Regular potato chips with the wing sauce.  I'm not digging it.  Yeah, for sure.  As a dip.  You got to dip.  Not to pour it on, just a dip.  You need it on the size of dip.  I'm not in.  So everything stays together.  I'm not in for this.  I had buffalo wings pot stickers.  Those were delicious.  Pot stickers.  Buffalo wings.  That sounds good.  Yeah.  Who does that?  Are you doing a food show, Sam?  I like a good boneless fucking buffalo wing.  I like a good boneless meat, too.  It's all meat.  And ranch.  Because there's nothing worse than biting into a chicken wing and getting that cartilage. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, I don't know about that.  Oh, I hate it.  Have you seen those people that just eat everything and there's just literally a bone left?  Yeah, yeah.  They eat the cartilage and ligaments and all that shit.  That's Western New York shit.  What kind of fucking maniac does that?  That's where they develop the wings.  They eat it like that.  They don't fuck around.  They're just eating that knob on the top of a chicken wing.  They don't fuck around.  If it's cooked right, all that stuff breaks down easy with your teeth.  It has a crunchy, like, cartilage, granule, grainy dick. 
[03:16:30]  It tastes like you're chewing through an eyeball.  Gristle.  Gristly.  Yes.  Like a little eyeball.  I don't want that at all.  My ex-girlfriend's bohemian father used to take a wing and just put the whole thing in his mouth.  Yes, and strip it.  And just peel the whole thing off.  Yes.  Fuck that.  That's how they do it.  That's very nasty.  You know what's at the end of that?  There's that knob of ligament, cartilage, and fucking yellow gookie shit.  Oh, I eat it like a faggot.  I have, all my fingers are out.  It's just my thumb and pointer finger. 
[03:17:00]  And I'm like, meh, meh, meh.  And I eat the chicken wing.  I put it up to my father.  I go, meh, meh, meh, meh.  That's so stupid.  I can't fucking, and sometimes I use a knife and fork.  Really?  I hate sticky fingers.  I know, but I don't eat that little ball-y thing.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  I keep that away.  You think Bubba Ray Dudley is thinking, well, if you're just going to sit here and ramble,  you could have fucking talked about me instead of chicken wings.  Oh, my God, Sam.  It's because Barry's waiting.  Yeah.  We all know.  Barry's out there.  If this company, I always have to look where we are, because we've been to a few places. 
[03:17:30]  If SiriusXM wants us to do extra radio, just put Barry outside the door every day.  Oh, man.  We wouldn't leave.  We'll do a marathon.  He has no awareness, does he?  He's just sitting there with this look, like, brr.  He's getting signals from the mothership through that head.  Stupid, lumpy head.  Oh, God.  What a bulbous head.  He's a good shave for shaving.  Because I'm sure the first time you shave your head, you find out all sorts of shit about  your own self. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, like, oh, man, I got to let this grow in now.  I got a big fucking mole over here.  I got a dent from when I was eight over here.  That's how Gorbachev felt when he started losing his hair.  He's like, what the fuck is this?  I got a fucking European Union map all over my head.  Yeah, I'm sure he didn't know that was there when he was 12, 13, 14.  He might have saw a little at his hairline and thought, like, wow, what the fuck is that?  Oh, I'll just comb my bangs over it.  No one will see it.  And then he starts going bald.  It's like, where's his end?  It ends at your fucking first vertebrae.  It looks like Africa. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know.  I'm sure it looks like one country out there.  Yeah.  All right, Roland, we're done with you.  We said no to everybody.  No, no, no.  And still on once to come in, we'll reconsider.  And what about Arnie?  Is he coming in or not?  We're waiting for February.  Schwarzenegger?  But is Arnie coming in?  We're waiting for his schedule.  So it might happen.  When does this movie come out?  I'm sure we're going to be pitched every fucking person that plays a low-grade criminal  on that thing and fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger won't come in. 
[03:19:00]  Are we going to get Schwarzenegger?  Schwarzenegger?  It'll be February.  Yeah, I would like that.  Yeah, but that's a winner.  Hello?  Imagine how he'd sit down and go, hello, hi, guys.  How are you?  It's a new movie.  It's a movie.  It's about the dead, blah, blah.  And we'd be like, ah, it's fucking awesome.  I'm just going to do that.  Yeah.  Would you get him to yell out Dylan just for longer or longer?  Just catchphrases.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Like all that good stuff.  All that wonderful stuff.  Dana!  Everything.  That shit takes me out of movies now. 
[03:19:30]  Doesn't it?  Yes.  We hear show clips.  Because we've played those fucking clips so many times.  Yeah.  When I hear it, my head pops up.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  It's like, ah, kindergarten cop.  Yep.  I couldn't watch that anyway.  It's just a bad movie.  We wasted your show today, Sam.  That's not a waste.  We had fun.  I'm sorry.  Well, at least he got to do it yesterday.  Oh.  That's right.  That's right.  Oh.  You were looking forward to doing it today.  He probably was.  And he got the Bubba Ray audio.  Did you write down your notes?  You got Snooki and JWoww audio you wanted to get to? 
[03:20:00]  No.  If you're not going to play Snooki and JWoww clips, I'm going to air the whole interview  on Sunday when the Sam Roberts show is on at 4 p.m. Eastern on this channel.  Very good.  Who allowed that?  Save me the N-word shit for tomorrow.  All right.  And save me, uh...  I thought you were talking to me personally.  All right.  I'll save you all of it.  Yeah, please.  Sam Roberts is next for a couple minutes, I guess.  What time is it?  You got a little time to do some shit.  You got to do break or you go right into it now?  No, I got to do a break.  So I'll be on for about five minutes.  But I've been talking with you guys this whole time. 
[03:20:30]  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Oh, you make me feel so bad.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  You are stupid.  You are stupid.  Pigment.  Pigment.  We nailed him.  And when a bald guy walks by another bald guy, is it like when you see a car on the highway?  Is it like when the two bus drivers pass each other and wave?  They have to wave because they're both driving a bus.  But they're both driving a bus, so they wave.  They flash their wacky heads at each other like headlights.  Or it's like, hey, that's also a forest green S10 blazer.  I got to wave at that guy.  If we understand what it's like to be bald, let's wave to each other. 
[03:21:00]  All right, baldy.  You're right, Bob.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with SiriusXM On Demand. </pre>
