<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with chaotic banter, including a joke about a "robbery rape," setting the tone for the "family entertainment" to follow.  Comedian Bill Burr, a guest in the studio, shared anecdotes about his experiences with TV makeup and his dislike of watching himself on screen, recounting awkward moments on sets, including a serious discussion about Hurricane Katrina interrupting his comedic timing.  The conversation touched on recent media sensations like *Grizzly Man* and *About Schmidt*,  with humorous reflections on inappropriate laughter in theaters.

A remote call from Jim Norton in Los Angeles detailed a disastrous trip filled with roach infestations, a disappointing encounter with a large escort, and numerous travel mishaps. He extensively complained about his accommodations and experiences.

Back in the studio, the hosts discussed the previous day's events, which involved multiple naked women engaging in explicit acts.  This transitioned into a segment focusing on an "assault on the media" incident in Boston, showcasing video footage of Opie and Anthony fans confronting a news reporter live on air. Callers, including "Blind Dave," "Sonny Ferrelli," and "Boston Strangler" (individuals involved in the Boston incident), described the prank's planning and execution in detail, recounting the chaotic scene.

The show continued with a listener's account of a failed "assault on the media" attempt on private property, followed by discussion of other similar pranks and potential targets in Chicago.  Callers criticized Howard Stern for his comments on Opie and Anthony's employment history and perceived hypocrisy regarding station management.

A significant portion featured the "Guess What's in My Pants" game with a female caller from Texas. Using sound effects from rubbing her phone against her genitals, she described her pubic hair style while the hosts and Bill Burr guessed, using offensive terms like "Hitler mustache." The caller ultimately revealed a "finely groomed regular triangle."

The show then covered several unrelated topics: the hosts' frustration with the New York Yankees' management; criticism of pop culture figures like Britney Spears and the VMAs;  comments on aging female celebrities; and new audio advertising techniques in magazines. Bill Burr remained a studio guest throughout these segments.

A segment focused on Hurricane Ophelia and its coverage, transitioning into discussions of past hurricanes, particularly Katrina.  Jamie Colby’s report on Ophelia's impact was discussed, leading to humorous speculation about sand in various body parts. Callers questioned the skipped letters in hurricane naming conventions and commented on the difficulty of making hurricanes sound alarming in the age of constant news coverage.  The hosts played clips of Laura Bush mispronouncing "Katrina" and Celine Dion's comments on the hurricane, and satirized Sean Penn’s aid efforts. A caller criticized the hosts for mocking Laura Bush's pronunciation.  The segment included a humorous interview with Master Poe, the security guard, about the studio's hurricane evacuation plan, followed by a song with homophobic slurs and audio from a Zach Wilde interview featuring a dress-wearing prank. The segment ended with a news story about a Long Island murder where two friends killed their orphan friend to use his house as a sex den.

Another segment heavily detailed the bizarre Long Island murder case, discussing the killers' poor planning, the methods of body disposal (including the use of pigs), and advancements in forensic science.  Callers shared anecdotes, and a humorous commercial for a "Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook" was played, as well as a call from Jeff Norris, a former guest and Frosted Mini-Wheats voice actor.

The final segment focused on *Breaking Bonaduce*, discussing Danny Bonaduce's erratic behavior, infidelity, alcoholism, and steroid use.  Clips from the show were played, highlighting his screaming matches and the impact on his children's participation.  The hosts compared it to other reality shows like *Surreal Life*.  A caller, "Kung Fooey," revealed they hadn't had sex in five years, sparking a discussion around celibacy and views on women.  The segment briefly mentioned a previous guest, Harry Reams, the hosts' attempts to provoke guests emotionally, and an anecdote about a woman named Maury shot in the face.  It concluded with the announcement that a listener, Eric, had won $100,000 in a Daily News contest.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're cordially invited.  To a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Mama!  Mama! 
[00:04:30]  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Hello, exactly.  Couple great beautiful girls, huh? 
[00:05:00]  Why didn't you go here to decro the piece of crap?  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big, fat body.  Idiot.  Idiot.  Oh.  That movie gets better and better the more you see it.  Yeah.  Napoleon Dynamite.  Cha.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:30]  That's right.  You are listening to the pioneers of satellite radio.  Sit back and enjoy.  Ah.  So much to do today.  I don't even know where to begin.  I guess we should begin by introducing and saying hi to Bill Burr.  What's going on?  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  How are you doing, Bill?  Doing great.  Yeah, just flew in, huh?  Yeah.  Heard that.  Still dressed up like he actually had somewhere to be. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You don't wear a button shirt on this show.  You don't have to impress us.  I still got the makeup on.  He came in with, like, TV makeup, a nice black collared shirt.  Yeah, this is my I'm going to be on TV shirt.  Yeah.  You have one of those, too?  Yeah.  This is the only color I can wear on TV, too.  It's got to be, like, totally black.  I'm with you, bro.  Because I'm just horrendously pasty.  Well, we have the same color.  They always, like, put the makeup on my face.  They go, yeah, that looks good.  Oh, look at your neck.  And they get, like, totally two-toned. 
[00:06:30]  Then they always forget the hands.  So at any point, if I'm trying to make a point, my hands come up.  I'm doing, like, Fosse.  Well, you were in L.A., and you taped some things and then jumped on a red-eye just to do our show today, right?  Absolutely.  Don't you learn that stuff through experience, though?  You learn that from going home and watching your performance on television and going, I've got to wear a darker shirt or something.  I can't watch myself.  You can't?  Oh, it's horrendous.  Every time you see, you're like, oh, God, look at the size of my head. 
[00:07:00]  It really is bad to watch yourself on television.  I hate it.  That's all you see is, like, the bad.  All the worst things possible, you see.  And it's like, didn't I look in a mirror before I went on?  Didn't I find my ears stick out?  You just hate yourself.  What am I making that face for when I talk?  Yeah, everybody else looks cool.  I just did it with D.L. Hughley.  Bernie Mac was on.  Some girl, Chelsea something or other from Tonight Show.  They were like, yeah, so they're going to be on, like, rapid fire. 
[00:07:30]  So, you know, try to get something in.  So, you know, it was almost like a change-up.  So I go there, and they immediately talk about the hurricane, and Bernie got, like, all serious and shit.  And I got all this wacky, what's up with New Orleans?  I'm like, well, I guess that shit's out the window.  So, yeah, yeah, it is a tragedy.  I'm going to make fun of the...  Yeah, nice buzzkill.  Jesus.  Turn around and start goofing.  Yeah, I'm going to start with people bobbing up in the water.  I wasn't going to go that far, but any joke at that point would have said anything. 
[00:08:00]  Right, anything.  You can't do anything when a comedian gets serious, right?  Yeah, and start bringing up God and stuff.  I was just like, oh, no.  You know, speaking of hurricanes, Hurricane Ophelia.  Ooh, we're all scared.  Yeah.  It just got upgraded from a tropical storm.  To a hurricane?  How cute.  Does anyone...  Is anyone looking at this like it's really that bad?  Well, hurricanes are this year's sharks.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, they had the sharks were at the beginning of the summer, I remember.  We went from sharks to grizzly bears for a little while. 
[00:08:30]  And now it's all about the hurricanes.  Yeah, because of that grizzly man movie.  And there was a few grizzly attacks.  Oh, did anybody see that, by the way?  They have, like, the audio of that guy just getting mauled to death.  I don't think I could sit through that.  Well, we were just talking about that yesterday, and I did see the movie, Bill.  And they don't play the audio.  Oh, they don't?  No.  Why wouldn't they?  I don't know.  That's a big selling point in the movie.  Yeah, we've coursed in about that.  It's like, why wouldn't you play the best thing?  The closest they get is they film a woman who's listening to it. 
[00:09:00]  So you see her with her little headphones on,  listening to the audio of the guy being killed by the bear,  and her doing that is in the movie.  Oh, that's great.  I remember the first time I saw Exorcist.  I didn't watch The Exorcist.  I just watched somebody's reaction to it.  Watching The Exorcist, yeah.  And I was like, wow, that's an incredible movie.  I still...  What a fucking waste of film that is.  I knew about 20 minutes into the film, I'm like,  oh my God, they're not going to play the audio.  What am I doing sitting here?  You could just tell how they were setting up things and stuff. 
[00:09:30]  I'm like, they are not going to play the audio.  And that's what the whole movie's about,  that the guy had a camera rolling as a grizzly was eating him and his girlfriend.  That's the whole movie.  Yeah.  So it's the build-up to the end.  Wow.  And they don't do it.  You know, you ever laugh at a really inopportune time in a movie and you get those looks?  That would have been the ultimate moment.  If they were playing the audio, somebody getting mauled, you just...  Wah!  You know what movie I did that to?  About Schmidt.  Oh, is that the Jack Nicholson one?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:10:00]  I openly laughed in the theater and I went to a matinee.  What awful part?  When he drove up to what he thought would...  Well, he thought his childhood home was still there.  Oh, right.  After all this shit happened to him.  The tire shop.  Where his wife died with the vacuum cleaner.  That would have been a good place to laugh.  Her shoe kind of off on her foot and the vacuum still going.  Just start busting out laughing right there.  So he loses his job, loses his wife, his daughter's a twat, but he's still going to go visit her. 
[00:10:30]  So he's driving across the country and he's stopping at all these hot spots that meant something to him in his life.  And then after all this crap they're just building, trying to get you to cry in this movie.  And then he pulls up to what's supposed to be his childhood home.  Well, it is, right?  The spot was anyway.  Yeah.  And it's now a tire store.  Yeah.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I just openly started laughing.  And the old ladies around me, because it was a matinee, were just pissed off.  Of course they were.  How dare you.  I did that in that, what was it, Sling Blade. 
[00:11:00]  Sling Blade?  And what was the country singer who was playing the role in that?  Oh, yeah.  Dwight Yoakam.  Dwight Yoakam.  Dwight Yoakam.  You remember when he flips out the whole family and he pushes that dude in the wheelchair right down the front porch?  Get the fuck out of my house!  Roaring.  Roaring laughing.  I was on a date, too.  I was getting, you know, the chick punches to the shoulder.  That was really funny, man.  That's a great way to test a future girlfriend.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:11:30]  See if she can take it.  Yeah.  If she's not laughing with you or getting pissed off, then you know, all right, I'm moving on.  Yeah.  It's just like, I can relate to it.  I'm relating to it.  Right.  Of course.  And he laughs in Schindler's List.  Oh, God.  Yes.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  Yes.  Yeah.  He blows that girl's brains out, like, when he goes, Jesus, I don't know, there's some  girl, like, one of the concentration camp people.  Yeah.  Wow.  Who was on a red eye?  One of them there Jews there was, she was bitching about something. 
[00:12:00]  And then the guy just sees, ah, gee, suddenly he was getting nagged by his wife.  And he just turned around.  He shoots her in the head.  I was more, like, amazed with, like, the acting.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I don't know.  We still laugh at that.  It's too early for that car crash sound effect.  I pardon you.  Yeah, we're just warming up.  Never too early.  Hey, we've got to say hi to Jim Norton.  Jimmy!  Stop.  Can you guys hear me?  Of course we can hear you.  Jimmy.  I can't hear you, maybe because the air conditioner's too loud in here.  Hold on a second.  Isn't it like, isn't it like midnight in Los Angeles? 
[00:12:30]  What time is it?  It's 4.12 in L.A.  It's, um, hold on.  Um, it's, uh, oh, yeah, a little after 4, I've got to go to bed because I've got to  get up.  I just had to leave the apartment that I was staying in, though.  Why?  Dude, this whole trip has been just a fucking disaster.  Oh, no.  Of course it has.  Oh, Jimmy.  Sound flustered.  Before I leave, the last thing I said, all right, let me treat myself.  I'll go out.  I'll get a girl.  Like, this is in New York.  I go to her place.  She was recommended to me by a federal police officer.  He said she's great because she has a big clit. 
[00:13:00]  I get there.  She's about 270 pounds.  Um, I'm like, all right, let me just see.  Well, maybe I'll do it and make the most of it because I'm leaving.  We're making out.  She tells me I shouldn't touch her back because she has Bengay on her back.  Yeah.  Because she has really heavy tits.  So she's got Bengay on her back.  And then she stands up and she shows me she has fat feet and she says she has legadermia.  Legadermia.  Which is kind of like what Hillary has, I think, where they get fat feet.  And the ankle goes right, uh, the foot goes right into the calf.  Yeah, it's where, like, water collects.  She's like, yeah, water collects. 
[00:13:30]  I've got to get that fixed.  So my fucking, before I leave, it's a disaster.  I get here.  The apartment is roach infested.  I've got roaches in my apartment.  Now, this is the apartment that you've rented for how long?  Five months.  Five months.  You went, you looked at it.  I remember you were very excited about it in Hollywood.  But I didn't look.  My managers looked at this one because the one we wanted to look at was too much money.  They lied about the price.  It was too much money.  So this one, um, we accepted.  I kind of signed for it without seeing.  Oh, no.  And it was fine. 
[00:14:00]  And I come back.  I got pictures.  I got video.  There's fucking roaches.  It was infested with cockroaches.  They were in the bedroom with the lights on.  I had to leave.  Holy shit.  Get out of here.  Are you kidding?  Dude, everything is booked in L.A.  because the stupid Microsoft convention and the, uh, uh, the Emmy's coming up.  So every hotel is booked.  I had to go into Beverly Hills.  My manager got me a deal on a hotel for two nights.  I have nowhere to stay out here.  So I have nowhere to stay.  I have nowhere to stay.  Homeless little Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm sure I won't be homeless, but it just, so far the trip has been an abortion 
[00:14:30]  and I haven't even gone to the studio yet.  And what are you going to do, uh, about living arrangements though?  I don't, I don't know.  You've got two days.  What's that?  You've got two days.  Dude, for, I know, you know, you're going to go to stupid's wedding in fucking Edmonton.  Rich Voss's wedding.  And I'm, and I'm flying Northwest, which is declaring bankruptcy and they've had a maintenance  strike for a month.  I'm never coming back.  Now, let me tell you, this is coming from Jimmy Norton who only flies Continental because,  as he's told everybody, youngest fleet.  Yep.  They are not in bankruptcy.  Yep.  They do very well. 
[00:15:00]  And, uh, he's very confident with flying that airline.  Only one of two airlines not in bankruptcy, right?  Yeah, it's crazy.  Actually, Jim, they laid off 3,000, uh, mechanics and they replaced them with 1,000.  Who did?  Uh, Northwest.  Northwest.  Oh, okay.  That's, that's, that's comforting though.  At least they, you know, they, they only cut their mechanic in force by, by two thirds.  That's fine.  That's acceptable.  They just got three times the work, man.  Three times the work and they're going to go in with a smile and make sure everything's  taken care of.  Of course, because none of their friends got fired, you know. 
[00:15:30]  Oh.  I'm sure they'll still do their jobs.  Look, my options were either that or Alaska Air, which I won't fly.  Oh, boy.  They have that fucking, it looks like Steve C on the side of the plane.  Yeah, it's a big, it's Steve on the tail.  Yeah, that big, you know, the, the, the, the cockpit recorder goes, wind shear, wind shear.  Pull up, pull up, pull up.  So I'm not flying them.  And the other one was an Air Canada flight connecting with United.  So I just decided to go with Northwest. 
[00:16:00]  I hate United.  So we'll see how that goes.  But Northwest.  It's been a nightmare.  I wasn't going to call until next week.  I'm like, I want to go to the wedding first.  You know, I'll call next week.  Right.  It's just been a disaster so far.  Well, did you bang that chick back here in New York?  No, I could do it.  I lost my rod.  She was kind of turning me on when she was rubbing her breasts on my, on my mule.  It was kind of nice.  Because the guy told me, yeah, she's dirty.  She'll do anything.  But then she wouldn't, she wouldn't do anything without a bag.  I asked her if she just like licked my balls a little.  She wouldn't even lick my balls.  She's like, no, I don't do that. 
[00:16:30]  Well, I don't do that.  She's a whore.  Well, yeah, I should have pointed that out to her.  But I'd already paid my money.  It was just, it was, it was just a waste.  And I just wanted to get out of there.  She was fat and she had a fake blonde wig on.  It was just horrendous.  I think she did like, like the top 10 things to make a man lose his fucking heart on.  Yeah, yeah.  My back smells like Bengay.  Because my breasts are too heavy.  I have legadermia.  Legadermia.  And I won't lick your balls.  You're becoming a huge star and this is what's happening to you.  Dude, I'm a fucking, I'm a train wreck of a human being. 
[00:17:00]  It's just the reality.  It's like the flight was great too.  Coming out was great.  I haven't slept since, since, since, uh, yesterday.  I haven't slept enough since I flew.  I'm like, the flight was good.  Everything was great.  No turbulence.  I'm like, this is going way too well.  The rental car, it's a brand new rental car.  57 miles on it.  I'm like, this is just, something's going to go wrong.  You know what?  Also, it's Jimmy's, like, he's going out there.  It's going to be in a series.  He's, it's like a dream come true.  Yeah.  And you probably have all these images in your head of what it's supposed to be like. 
[00:17:30]  And then you get out there and it just starts falling apart with a roach infested apartment.  He sounds like Jewel when she first got there, sleeping in her car.  It's like, dude, you booked a show.  It's not supposed to work out that way.  Dude, when you turn, this is how you know you're infested with roaches.  Yeah.  Like, when I turned the light on and I saw one on the door, that's bad because there's  no food source on the door.  But I like, all right.  And no crumbs are on the door.  But when you have the lights on for 20 minutes and you turn the air conditioner on and you 
[00:18:00]  still see them walking across the floor, that's a problem.  When I opened the cabinet, there was one in the cabinet.  Is the place dirty?  Is it like?  It's an older building.  And again, it's expensive by most standards.  But because it's a furnished apartment and you're in L.A., there's not much you can do.  You just got to turn the lights on, get in the middle of the room and go, I'm a fancy man.  They understood that.  It's like they were mocking the fancy man before.  Dude, it was awful.  And I know this woman's not going to want to give me my money back. 
[00:18:30]  It's going to be a problem.  So I paid like one month and then a month's deposit.  So I know I'm going to get fucked for that money.  This is just turning it to be an awful trip.  I'm not hoping.  The script is very funny.  I saw the script.  That's the only good thing.  You have video of these cockroaches?  Yeah, I did it with my camera because I know this bitch is not going to want to give me my money back.  So I took horrible photographs of the little fellas.  And I have video of like three of them on my camera.  Like just shit video.  But I have that.  I have one in the bedroom on the rug.  I mean, when you see cockroaches in a bedroom that's got the lights on on the rug, you're completely in the fast way. 
[00:19:00]  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.  Because I was going to stay for the night.  I'm like, maybe they're just in the kitchen.  Oh, dude, they'd be crawling on you.  Yeah, I know.  Or they'd be on the wall.  Crawling in and out of your mouth, seeing if there's food in there.  It was all a furnished apartment?  Yeah, which I don't like the idea to begin with.  Oh, what about the bed?  Did you look at the mattress?  No, it was okay.  It looked like it was a decent bed.  I didn't even lay in it, though.  Did you?  Was sheets on it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, did you look underneath and look what the mattress looks like? 
[00:19:30]  No, I didn't get that.  Dude, you've got to look.  There's probably stains and roaches and, ugh.  Well, I should have known better when, like, I was told there was, like, a fast, like, an  internet connection, and I get there, and I go to her house to sign the paperwork, and  she hands me a box and says, here's your DSL.  So I had to fucking hook my own DSL up, and of course it didn't work.  I called the DSL people.  They said his phone number's registered to somebody at a different address.  It was just the whole thing.  Oh, clusterfuck, yeah.  I would love to hear the audio of him doing that.  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:00]  Tourette's syndrome.  Yeah, why are you so calm right now, Jimmy?  We know you.  He's exhausted.  And then to top it off, I have fucking Fat Bob calling me to tell me that it was nothing  but chicks who wanted to put their pussies on a face, anyone's face.  I didn't even want to tell you about this yesterday.  I heard about it, Bobby told me, and I heard part of the replay in the car.  It's the first time since we've been on the air that we had the type of action in this  studio that we got yesterday.  We weren't able, whenever Jimmy's here, and girls come in. 
[00:20:30]  We are barely able to get them to get down to a bra and panties, never mind wowing or  taking their pants off, nothing.  We get nothing from girls that come in here.  Yesterday, Jimmy's gone one day.  We get three girls, more that were in here.  There were like five girls, but three of the girls, all the girls got naked.  Three of them decide they want to try the wiffle ball back challenge.  And take the wiffle ball back, comes down the first time in a year, and they lube it up,  and one by one, there they go, shoving it right in them. 
[00:21:00]  Five girls completely naked in the studio for, I don't know, close to an hour.  Then a lesbian show that was just box eating at its best.  Bob Kelly is just sitting on a chair with one of these chicks on his lap, massaging her tits.  It's just, and that would have been Jimmy.  Yeah, that's great, but instead I'm doing a great impression of a Puerto Rican in Los Angeles.  Oh, you poor son of a bitch.  Dude, it's just, it really is awful.  What was the name of that escort service that you got the Bengay waterlogged woman from? 
[00:21:30]  It wasn't a service.  It was this guy I talked to online, who's actually a cool guy who I like, but he recommended this one to me.  He's like, yeah, she's cool.  She had a big clit.  And she did have a big clit.  Maybe it was like a bait-and-switch thing that was happening.  No, because I've seen a picture of her before, it was her.  But the way she took the photo, she kind of like was laying out with like a long flowing thing,  so you can't see what a fatso she is.  She kind of hid it really well.  You know, but I can't blame her for that. 
[00:22:00]  I kind of knew she was going to be a fucking blimp, and I still went.  I just didn't realize how fat she'd be.  That's like on MySpace.  Whatever photo they use, everybody looks good-looking.  So what you do is you click on more photos, and then you see, like,  then you've got to see the real deal, because they're going to put the best photo possible.  Yeah, because if you're ugly, you've got one good one.  One good one in you, of course.  Everyone has one in them.  Poor Jimmy.  He's like the young girl from the Midwest that goes out to L.A. to go in movies,  and she gets there and, like, is met by a pimp at the bus, 
[00:22:30]  and she's just getting fucked in the ass a week later.  Yeah, that pretty much is what it's like.  I had stars in my eyes.  Yeah.  It's just...  Got off the Greyhound.  Yeah.  Gets off the Greyhound bus.  He's walking down Hollywood Boulevard looking at the stars on the sidewalk.  Hollywood.  It's an awful montage.  Yeah, I can see the montage.  I see the montage in my head.  And there he is in his cockroach-infested apartment,  looking up at the Hollywood sign.  Yeah.  Yeah, I made it.  Looking at Billboards.  Right at the end of the song, 
[00:23:00]  some homeless guy says something a little mean to foreshadow.  Right, right.  The roaches and shit that he's going to see in the next hour.  He looks up at one of the many billboards in Los Angeles,  and you see his face get superimposed on someone's face up there.  It's all excited.  Hey, Jimmy, you missed Harry Reams yesterday.  Yeah, I know.  Yoshi told me, so it was good.  I missed the chicks fucking each other with cucumbers,  and I missed a porn legend while I was running around  stepping on roaches with my fucking fat right boot.  That guy had a hell of a story to tell yesterday. 
[00:23:30]  Is he doing real estate in Utah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a real estate agent.  Imagine buying your house from Harry Reams.  Yeah.  You can see it in his eyes.  He's barely holding on.  He's been clean and sober 16 years.  He's married.  We could have knocked him off that wagon so quickly.  Yeah.  What do you think of the chicks?  He was the one that got him naked.  We thought the girls were just going to hand out wow stickers,  and they weren't up for anything.  The second they walked in, he's like, let me see something.  Let me see a little.  He turned in a second, and one of the girls flashed. 
[00:24:00]  She was wearing a skirt with no panties and pulled her skirt up and flashed the vag right at him.  And he goes, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We could have him drinking.  Easily.  Back in porno.  His mustache was growing back.  That big 70s porno stash.  Yeah.  He was definitely barely holding on.  Did she have a nice one, a nice meaty one?  All of them had nice meaty vagis.  Of course they did.  You loved it.  Of course they did.  They all had fine parts, Jimmy.  One girl, she was Korean and Jewish.  That's right.  And she got up on the console and put her ankles behind her head, 
[00:24:30]  and it just looked like an explosion at the Steakums factory.  God damn it.  God damn it.  Yeah.  The one day I'm not there, the first day I fucking leave.  That's who he was saying.  I'm going to do a shit karma.  Jimmy, one of the girls had a nickname.  What was it?  Cock Hog.  Yeah.  She self-proclaimed herself Cock Hog.  She goes, yeah, that's why I'm a Cock Hog.  Dude, you aren't here when Cock Hog is. 
[00:25:00]  That's even disgusting for a porn star.  Yeah.  You were taking pictures of cockroaches, and we were hanging out with Cock Hogs.  Cock Hog.  Yeah.  I'm a Cockroach Hog, and you got Cock Hogs.  Cock Hogs.  Yeah, so.  So we miss you, Jimmy.  Well, you can rest assured I miss you, too.  You understand, I haven't even done a table read, and I really do want to just leave.  I'm like, I can't.  Oh, no.  I'm looking forward to doing this, but just the fact that that stupid asshole has to get married in northern Canada. 
[00:25:30]  Because he's pussy whipped.  Why would you do that?  Why would you drag your friend up there?  You don't.  It's inconveniencing your friend and loved ones.  Dude, I really wish I had something else to do so I could just say, no, I can't.  Well, you've got to get married where the girl lives, though.  Yeah, I know, man.  That's the deal.  What's that's the deal?  That's the deal.  That's not the deal.  That's the deal most of the time.  It's the United States of America.  That's where you get married and divorced.  How many of you have...  Yeah, someplace cool like Italy. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, if you're going to go somewhere else, you don't go to Canada.  Is that even legal down here?  Is he really married if you get married in Canada?  I don't know if it holds up.  Don't you have to be married in the United States?  Good question.  Of course it is.  Smelling horses.  All right, Jimmy.  It sounds like you're off to a great start there in Hollywood.  Yeah, man.  I've got to sleep because I've got to go to wardrobe tomorrow.  Ask for the ring and a hockey player slap shoots it up the aisle.  Stupid Canada.  Stupid Canada.  Well, we look forward to the stories from Rich Voss' wedding. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, I'm sure it'll be good.  I'm going to try to tape some of it if I can.  Oh, the toast if you can, please.  Are you going to send the pictures of the cockroaches in so we can all check it out?  Well, yeah, I didn't have a connection.  I should get that in for you sometime later today, but I've got to shower now and go to bed and get up by like 12.  Is it true that when they want the couple to kiss at Voss' wedding, everybody walks up to Rich with their fork and taps on his teeth?  Cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling, cling.  That's cool. 
[00:27:00]  All right, with that, Jim, we'll let you be.  All right, Jimmy, please take care of yourself out there.  Well, you know what it is?  I think that they were telling all that they had to get me out of here.  Yeah, well, you know, Ben ran in and he said, you know, we've got to move on.  We've got other things to do today.  All right, guys.  Yeah, we've got to let you go.  We've got to let you go, Jimmy.  You should let me be.  All right, Billy, have a good call.  Unless you want to talk to, wait, we've got Steve from Yellowstone on the phone, if you want to.  Ramone, bring me a Spix resident. 
[00:27:30]  All right, Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy, take care, man.  Bye, later.  All right.  Oh, I feel bad for him.  He's out there taping the HBO show there.  He had everything but the Scientology story.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's coming.  I'm sure that's coming.  You know what it is.  He's such a pervert and he can be such a prick, but alone out there, he's such a vulnerable little guy.  He sounded like Woody Allen.  Yeah.  I don't know what to do.  He is like Woody Allen. 
[00:28:00]  He doesn't know what to do.  Cockroach infested.  He should.  And you know something?  Jimmy knows better.  I don't know how the hell he rented a place without looking at it, knowing Jimmy.  He doesn't do that stuff.  Well, he does things last minute, though.  So, he had no choice in the matter.  I was excited.  It was part of the montage.  Yeah, part of the montage.  Oh, the poor bastard.  Hand up the keys, shaking the hand, thumbs up.  Yeah, thumbs up.  Gleam in his eye.  All right.  I got to get a cup of coffee.  You want some coffee, Bill?  I got to say I'm good.  I got O.J. and some water. 
[00:28:30]  We got a Starbucks machine here, though, now.  Yeah.  I've never gotten into coffee, man.  You're not a coffee guy?  It's dirty water.  Burns my tongue.  I don't like it.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  We got Bill Burr in studio today.  We want to replay your OzFest PSAs.  Oh, okay.  We can't get enough of that.  Also, we found Celine Dion and Larry King.  We got to play this for you because you were talking about celebrities in the hurricane.  We'll get into that after the break.  Okay.  She's crazy.  We got audio of one of these reporters in the middle of Hurricane Ophelia. 
[00:29:00]  We'll get to that in a few minutes.  And when we get back, I guess we got to talk about the assault on the media that happened  in Boston.  I'll just say, I think we have a leader.  A leader.  For the month, and this could be the winner.  No one's going to beat this assault on the media in Boston.  It's brutal.  It's really, really good.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Sorry for all the background noise.  I just was opening a box. 
[00:29:30]  I got another gift.  Another gift.  I'll show you where the box.  Who's in the box?  What is in the box?  Oh, what's in the box?  It's really a cool gift.  Thanks, Andy from Seattle.  He sent me a used drill because I'd gotten the drill bits a while ago.  We're really starting to get some strange, strange gifts.  That is a skill drill.  This would be great to use in my apartment, though, right?  That is fine.  But for your needs, though, I couldn't see you needing anything better than a cordless thumb. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, this is kind of a fucking...  Yeah, now you need a cord.  You should have a cordless drill in your house.  Thanks for the 35-pound drill.  That is a heavy drill.  Which I can use to fucking hang my celebrity photos.  This is good if I'm going to build a deck in my apartment building, you shithead.  Anybody have anything lighter?  Like maybe a fucking bowling ball with two ledge shoes?  You're a creep, Andy.  It's a little strange, to say the least.  Fucking weird gifts I get.  How about just some pictures of vaginas and some pornography? 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Let's say hi to Reg on Long Island.  Reg?  Fucking Norton is totally pissing me off.  Why, sir?  What, sir?  Dick bag.  What?  Dude, you don't appreciate shit.  What, this guy had to send you a fucking drill?  Oh, it's...  Hey, wait, you sent him the drill?  No.  No, no, no.  Oh.  I'm saying, whoever this guy was, it wasn't me.  I wouldn't fucking send him shit.  You don't understand something.  Dude, here's what you don't get.  We do get really strange gifts, though, Reg. 
[00:31:00]  I'll tell you what you...  Dude, I'll tell you.  There would be nothing without the show.  Dude, I'll tell you...  I'll tell you what you don't get.  I want a new drill.  You understand?  I'm an entertainer.  And if a common person wants to send me a gift to pay homage, that is acceptable.  You want to jerk me off with your common parts and both...  But it will be a new fancy drill for a man of my caliber. 
[00:31:30]  You want me, me, plugging a cord in like you have to?  Yo, come on.  I want a cordless fancy drill, boy.  And think about how that guy feels.  You take it to post it, shove it in a five cents at your head.  Kitty, really?  Well, think about how I feel.  Hoping I have a new cordless gift and seeing that cumbersome cord.  Think about how a man in my position feels.  You don't deserve to sit there.  I wish Bill Burr would kick you right in the fucking teeth right now.  Bill Burr wouldn't dare. 
[00:32:00]  Bill Burr knows a fancy person when he's sitting next to one.  Yeah, it's not trying to divide and conquer.  That's right, sir. You're not smart enough to hurt my feelings.  No, I'm not trying to divide and conquer.  You're with your toes with the cords on them.  I'm not dead, so I can't kick him in the mouth.  Nah, you wouldn't kick me in the mouth.  I'll kick you right in the mouth.  Nah, you wouldn't. Fuck you and fuck your mother. What do you think of them apples?  Oh, jeez.  Fuck you.  What do you think, that shit gets to me?  No, I'm just saying it to you.  Well, Bill Burr kicking me in the teeth gets to me, so I'm saying fuck you.  How much was the postage on this shit?  Yeah, why don't you go hang yourself with the cord on your drill?  Hold on.  Wait, I want to know how much the postage... 
[00:32:30]  Hold on, common man. Hold on, union guy.  I want to know how much postage was on this.  I don't know, but whoever this is, it was shit, and it should have been first class overnight postage.  You don't deserve it.  Shut your fucking mouth.  You don't deserve it.  Shut your dumb Italian mouth.  I'm talking, boy.  Shut up, common person.  There's a fancy entertainer talking.  I don't know.  Where do little people put prices?  I don't even know.  I don't look at prices.  I just say, shit.  And they pick it up.  All right, Reg.  Jimmy, you're a cock.  All right. 
[00:33:00]  Go with Reg.  Toby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  And tell me, we are all on drugs, yeah.  Never getting on.  We are all on drugs, yeah.  Give me some of that stuff.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:33:30]  In studio today, Bill Burr.  Don't forget to watch Bill Burr tomorrow night.  On HBO, baby.  Nice.  Your half-hour comedy special airs tomorrow, right?  Yes.  Very, very cool.  If that doesn't do anything for my career, I'm going to kill myself.  I'm making that promise.  I'm going to leap off a comedy club rooftop.  Leap off the Hyatt next to the comedy store.  Twist my ankle, limp in, and do the third show.  What's up, Wichita?  Yeah, you guys have like a roller coaster type of life.  You've got the big highs. 
[00:34:00]  You've been doing a lot of TV lately.  Oh, yeah.  And you've got the HBO thing tomorrow night, and then what?  And then it goes back down to some club in the middle of nowhere, right?  No, I've got this show all next week, and then after that, then I'm at like, I don't  know, Assumption College.  You know, it's going to be like, in like a cafeteria.  You know what the worst is?  Those college gigs where they would put you in the cafeteria at like 12 noon.  Not only is it 12 noon, and it's broad daylight, which is like fucking kryptonite to comedy.  They wouldn't even have any posters. 
[00:34:30]  No one had any clue a show was even going to happen.  Oh, man.  All of a sudden, they would just come up, and they'd always fuck up the intro by saying  your name first.  You want to say the name last, so you go, and here's Bill Burr, they'd be like, we  have a comedian, his name's Bill Burr, he's been on Comedy Central, and here he is.  And then you're just walking up, and no claps, people just looking up.  Oh, God damn.  Because you've got to train the audience.  They've got to know when to clap, and usually it is with the big N.  Let's hear it for Bill Burr! 
[00:35:00]  They had no idea there was even a show.  That's one of those things you're just saying to yourself as they're bringing you up.  You're just going, okay, in an hour, I'm going to be in my car, driving away from this nightmare.  You don't even think about what you have to do in the next few minutes.  It's like, an hour from now, I'm going to be driving.  The worst one I ever had, I was in Kansas, some fucking awful place in the middle of Kansas.  And it's like, when you do a nooner, it's like you have to be totally on.  You've got to have the set of your life just to get minimal response. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  And I was fucking completely off, and there was like 20 kids spread out in this one table of black kids.  So I'm like, oh, fuck.  I just go up there, and they just start giving me shit, and I'm bombing, and I'm sweating.  At one point, I'm literally trapped in my act, like not even addressing the fact that I'm bombing.  And what's up with computers?  Those are crazy, aren't they?  Just like echoing off this fucking cafeteria.  And at one point, this black kid walks by.  I swear to God, he couldn't have been more than like two inches from my face.  Just walks by me and just goes, and I just kept walking, and I had no comeback. 
[00:36:00]  Dude, the fucking rage that was going through me when I left that place, just screaming at my windshield.  I'm not fucking doing these anymore.  These are fucking bullshit.  Blowing out my voice.  Oh, it was the worst.  Oh, that is bad.  We're going to say that a hundred times today now.  Oh, is that bad?  Oh, it was one of the most humiliating moments. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I really don't know how you guys do it.  Stand-up comics are like a holdover from Vaudeville or something.  You guys are just out on the road going to these shithole little places.  Who does that?  There's no respect for comics either.  No.  They were doing a review of that Pamela Anderson roast.  Right.  And they were talking how crazy they got it.  And they were like, it wasn't even like Tommy Lee or any of that.  It was the bitter comedians, these show business lifers.  I've never heard of that.  Oh.  And then they have like three lines from like really good comics, which are hilarious. 
[00:37:00]  They never think that maybe roasting somebody is a skill.  Right, right.  And they think that these guys are really bitter about Pamela Anderson making it like  she's taking their fucking roles on.  And that's what makes them get up there and say that shit.  Not that, you know, they wrote it, thought it up.  Yeah.  And all these other tools are reading off of a teleprompter.  Right.  Show business lifer.  I never even heard that expression.  That's again, you're just trapped, like you said, trapped in your act.  You're a lifer.  You're trapped in that life.  Never getting out.  Dude, don't paint it that way. 
[00:37:30]  I'm going to get out.  He's going to get out.  I'm getting cruel, man.  I'm getting out, man.  He's got a big hit tomorrow night.  Bill Burr, HBO.  His Hacker Alconomy special.  I got nowhere else to go.  Tomorrow night on HBO.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nothing.  Let's say hi to Blind Dave.  Call it from Boston.  Blind Dave.  Hey, man.  What's up, bro?  Just reporting.  I didn't see it, but I heard it.  Open it to the XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, the assault on the media that happened in Boston last night.  Fox 25.  Yes. 
[00:38:00]  I wanted to explain Blind Dave to Bill Burr, though.  Ah, yes.  Blind Dave has done a lot of great things for our show.  He's legally blind.  You can barely see, right?  Yeah.  I mean, there's nothing.  You see maybe some shadows, right?  Yeah.  We actually had him...  You're retarded, right?  Come on.  Try to read something.  Tell him how retarded you are.  I got to renew my license next month.  Already?  Yeah, it's four years.  It has been four years since he got his Connecticut license.  Easy, easy.  It's all right.  They won't know where. 
[00:38:30]  He got his driver's license renewed for us.  He figured it all out, how to walk up.  There's no eye test.  There's no eye test.  So he figured out how to memorize things and just kind of went up there and convinced the  person that he could see.  He had a friend with him helping him along, making believe he had an injured leg or something.  I lost my glasses in a car wreck.  Oh, that's what it was.  Right.  He lost his glasses and they gave him a driver's license.  The guy's blind. 
[00:39:00]  He was able to figure out where to stand for the picture and everything.  Isn't that amazing?  And then we had him do blind boxing where he got his ass kicked.  How many ribs did he break?  I think four.  I don't know.  Yeah, he cracked or broke four ribs.  Who did he fight?  Another blind guy.  That popped his eyes out before he fought.  This guy, Matt.  I remember.  When you see two blind guys back to back throwing punches forward, it is the funniest goddamn  thing ever.  That's the problem.  You have that on DVD. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  You want to own that?  Yeah, we got video.  Yeah, let's get the video back up on foundrymusic.com.  That'll get a lot of hits today, Steve.  And then when somebody, because we didn't have a ring, all we had was a ring of people really  standing around watching.  Whenever anybody in the crowd made a noise.  Was this some gangs of New York?  Did you give them gardening tools to smash each other with?  They couldn't see each other, obviously.  So whenever anyone in the crowd made a noise, like both blind guys would go lunging at the  person with fists flying. 
[00:40:00]  A few spectators got punched right in the face.  I got punched.  They bump into somebody in the crowd and turn around and just wail at them.  Yeah, I'd have to think there's not a lot of jabs thrown in a fight like that.  No, not a lot of jabs.  But we found a ringer.  Roundhouse.  We found a ringer of this blind Matt.  He popped his eyes out and just beat the crap out of Blind Ager.  Just destroyed him.  Bruce's kidney.  His spleen.  Bruce's spleen.  He was in trouble.  How many rounds did it go?  Like three.  I don't know.  Three?  Four?  I think it was three.  Yeah, like three rounds. 
[00:40:30]  I got beat up by him in a bottle of Jack Daniels.  Oh, yeah.  You were real drunk.  He was smashed.  He was drunk also.  Yeah, but the scary thing is we'd ring the bell and they would be slowly moving around  the room trying to figure out where they were going to punch and they'd be like it was saying  they're trying to listen for unsure feet.  Right.  Yeah.  And they would just be punching the air in front of them.  And then as soon as there was any, like Ant said, he's explained the whole thing.  Any contact and then all hell would break loose.  And then we'd have to stop the fight for a little while.  E-Rock putting up links to video as we speak to blind boxing. 
[00:41:00]  Good.  So, Blind Dave, you heard the assault on the media up there, huh?  Yeah, I was like half falling asleep and all of a sudden I just heard,  XM Satellite Radio, Opie and Anthony.  It was pretty good from an audio point.  I don't know what it looked like, though.  Oh, it looks great because I guess some of the people that were with the reporter got involved.  Oh, no way.  Tried to get the people holding the sign up out of the way.  Right.  Well, the video's up on opiananthony.com, foundrymusic.com. 
[00:41:30]  We should get Steven here.  He knows all about this one.  But I saw it quickly before it went on the air.  Thanks, Blind Dave.  Punch it out.  Later.  And the reporter's doing some stupid story about, I don't even know, sweeping or something?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden a huge Opie and Anthony sign appears from the distance  and the guy's running full speed right at the reporter screaming Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Steve.  Whoa.  Come on.  Set her down.  Come on. 
[00:42:00]  Nice lane.  Hey, hey.  Right on the seat.  I like that.  A little bit more room.  Look at that.  You're learning how to use your hybrid better.  Well, it's hard to navigate in these tight spaces.  Fagmobile.  It's not a fagmobile.  I don't know where you're getting this from.  So this was a great assault on the media last night, huh?  It really was.  It really was.  We're hoping that they can send some better video in, but you really get a clear idea of  what they're doing.  They went after, I think her name is Bianca De La Garza.  She's a reporter for Fox 25 up in Boston, and they were doing a story from the Beacon Hill  section, and these maniacs, you can just see this angry mob coming in from the background 
[00:42:30]  as she starts the story.  I see that.  First of all, it looks like people just walking on the sidewalk way in the distance, but no,  these guys are ready to do the assault on the media, and then they go from a walk to  a full run with a huge Opie and Anthony sign.  They're screaming.  Yeah, spin that screen around a little bit.  She's doing a story on snow fines, something weird.  Oh, now you've done it.  Oh, good one.  Damn.  He's turning the monitor around, and he shuts it off.  What'd you do?  There it is.  All right, so he's going to back up the video. 
[00:43:00]  I know this is radio, but you can find the video for yourself on opianthony.com.  Here's the latest assault on the media.  A story on snow fines, I guess.  On what?  Fox 25 in Boston.  You see the thugs walking.  There's like four of them.  Oh, in the background.  You see that?  They're just walking up.  Oh, she's showing us how to sweep things.  And here they come, screaming, Opie and Anthony XM Sign Life Radio.  Then the one guy has a huge Opie and Anthony sign.  Who's the guy that tackled him?  It's a thug from Fox. 
[00:43:30]  A thug from Fox.  Didn't officially tackle him, but he blocked him.  He blocked him, but you know what it did?  It took him out of commission.  But the other guy that's with the sign guy had a sticker, and he ran right up.  And that guy is, that's Meat Bosoms from the guy that went after Dan Housley.  Not the Meat Bosoms.  Yeah, the Meat Bosoms.  Holy crap.  I think he calls him.  Hog Hog.  Yeah.  We love the names here.  Of course.  We don't like real names anymore.  I think he calls himself Sonny Forelli, but I don't want to mess up his name.  Well, we got Sonny Forelli on hold.  Oh, maybe that's it. 
[00:44:00]  We got Boston Strangler on hold.  It's kind of funny.  Each city has their people that are attempting assaults on the media.  There's like a whole gang in Buffalo.  There's a gang in Boston.  A bunch of people in New York.  And these guys are relentless, because they just go after the news crews the second they  see them.  They must walk around with the stickers and the signs.  I was going to say, how the hell do they know?  I mean, how do you know that they're going to do this sweeping story?  And where they're going to do it?  Yeah.  I mean, either you live centrally located to where a lot of these news stories are going  on, or you're just driving around constantly looking for news trucks. 
[00:44:30]  But you have the sign and everything on you?  They must.  They must travel with the sign with them.  These guys set up the shot a good hour or two before they actually do it.  So all you have to do is drive by and see the news truck, and you know something is happening  in your neighborhood.  That is a slow-ass news thing.  I don't think I've ever seen them setting up a shot.  No?  Really?  Maybe a couple times in Times Square, but I don't know.  Yeah.  And they also have a very obvious pattern.  If they're doing a story at noon, they're going to do the same story at 5, and the same  story at 6, and the same story at 10.  Maybe they have a scanner.  Oh, they have a police scanner?  They have a police scanner. 
[00:45:00]  It would be easy to find.  Let's roll.  Oh, really?  But what a slow news day in Boston.  They're reporting on wiping snow off of your car and parking in the snow.  It's September.  The middle of September.  Stupid Boston.  I guess they're done with the Hurricane Katrina thing.  Time to move on.  Yeah.  More important things.  Well, let's say hi to Sonny Ferrelli.  Sonny!  Hey, how are you guys doing, man?  That was your assault on the media?  Absolutely.  And I've got to tell you guys, it's a lot hotter than what you guys explained it to  be. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Walk us through assault on the media.  Well, I can't really get into too much details, but let's put it this way.  It does take about an hour and a half to two hours of preparation before it actually  happens.  That's all you got?  He doesn't want to give away his...  I can't really get into details, guys.  I mean, but I'll tell you this.  I'll tell you this.  This is the second time I actually hit Bianca.  Yeah.  The first time was a botched attempt over in Foxborough Stadium, and I was on private 
[00:46:00]  property and I knew it.  And those guys over at Fox, they actually get to know me pretty well, which makes it  even more hotter, because they actually got my picture posted up at the studio.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Sonny Pirelli's been doing a lot of assaults on the media up there in Boston.  A lot of botched attempts, but finally he scored big time last night.  So, Sonny, you found out somehow that they were doing a live shot.  Yeah, well, first of all, they were doing a gay thing right down the street at Beacon 
[00:46:30]  Hill, because, you know, the gay marriage thing, and I thought I was going to be able  to get a shot there.  And then I realized those knuckleheads were doing another shot right by the studio, which  made it even more hotter.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, I just kind of hung around there in the dark alley somewhere, and Boston Strangler  ended up meeting up with me, and he was the one who actually was holding the sign.  Oh, he was the guy with the sign.  Wait, wait, he was holding the big Opie and Anthony sign?  Yeah, and what happened was we started going from the sidewalk, and we started running 
[00:47:00]  towards him, and the camera guy tried to stop me.  I think he had a better chance of stopping a Mack truck, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  But he did stop Boston Strangler for a little while.  And that allowed you to run toward the camera with the Wow Opie and Anthony bumper sticker.  Right, that was me.  All right, you got it all figured out.  They actually escorted Boston Strangler away from the picture.  Yeah, but he got to sign in.  And there's a huge commotion behind the reporter.  And I got to give her credit.  She didn't even flinch.  No. 
[00:47:30]  She continued with her story.  Did her story like nothing was happening.  She didn't turn around and say, what the fuck is your problem?  No, man.  Like Mike Myers standing next to Kanye West.  Yeah, exactly.  You think the control booth is telling them, you know, keep cool, keep cool, you got a bunch  of guys behind you?  No, I think they're just looking, going, don't upset her.  Just let her roll through this.  She's a professional.  Hey, Boston Strang.  Those four guys had nothing to do with the shot.  They were actually walking up the street.  We're using them as cover.  You know what else is great?  The shot turns into some kind of MTV TRL shot. 
[00:48:00]  Like the camera's moving.  Yeah.  It's one of those, like, you know, young, hip MTV cameramen tilting the camera.  Yeah, man.  They're trying everything they can do to keep the sign out of the shot.  I had no idea that you guys used those four guys as cover.  So it's only two of you guys.  Yes.  Oh, you got to see the video.  Using innocent bystanders as cover.  Nice.  Yeah.  Great shields.  It's on opianthony.com.  Boston Strangler.  Hey, what's going on, Opie?  Yeah, basically what happened was Sonny gave me a call last night. 
[00:48:30]  He said, dude, I'm down here on Beacon Hill.  We got an assault on the media going down.  Originally I was going to spot for him, but because I looked so damn close, I jumped in my car and just flew down there.  And basically what happened is we ducked right behind the church.  And as these, you know, four guys were walking out, Sonny got the okay to go up there and, you know, hit the news reporter.  Not hit them, you know, literally.  So we ran up there.  Sonny managed to get by. 
[00:49:00]  I got taken out by this huge thug.  I see that.  He dragged me, like, by my arm.  And he starts telling me, not today, not now.  And, uh, meanwhile, Sonny...  What, such an important story they were doing?  Yeah, they're talking about sweeping up snow.  No, today is the day we're doing it.  Not this story, fella.  Not on my watch.  Have some respect.  Not on my watch.  He got hit bad, bro.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Boston.  So basically, you know, Sonny got in there. 
[00:49:30]  He managed to get it out.  And I get dragged off looking like a little beaten schoolgirl or whatever.  Not at all, man.  You got the sign in the shot big time.  Then you get manhandled and pushed out of the shot.  And then Sonny comes running right toward the reporter with the wow sticker yelling and screaming.  It was perfect.  We got assaulted doing assault on the media.  That's right.  You certainly did.  I got the audio for the people that aren't watching the video right now.  Yes, we're very happy to say that.  But, you know, David, it is coming.  And I'm sorry to see the bearer of bad news. 
[00:50:00]  But folks, remember these?  The good old shovel and brumble.  We're going to have to get real familiar with these.  Because if you don't see the car off of the dust, you'll find...  Definitely worth taking a look at the video just to see the pandemonium.  That was going on.  I go home that night, last night, and my wife's in the living room.  She turns around and says, my 12-year-old boy came down running downstairs. 
[00:50:30]  I saw Daddy on TV.  I saw Daddy on TV.  That's great.  We need a better copy of the video.  The copy we got up on Foundry is pretty good, but...  You have a 12-year-old?  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I thought it was just some high school or college kid.  Bill, we're used to hearing that.  That's why we just went with it.  Yeah, you're right.  He has a 12-year-old.  So my grandson comes in.  That is scary.  I'm trying to explain it, which made it more harder. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, I'm punching out before I put my foot in the mouth more.  All right, guys.  It was a great assault on the media.  I think you're...  No, you're definitely in the lead for the assault on the media contest for September.  Listen, what's up for grabs this month, guys?  A portable Delphi MiFi radio.  Dinner with our own E-Rock at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Fantastic.  30 days free video game rental from Gamefly.com.  And finally, admission to the Opie and Anthony Show studios to watch the show live through  a glass partition in a hazmat suit. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, they get to sit out there and watch the show through the glass.  It's like it's an operating theater for students to learn how to do the latest medical techniques.  And then at the end of the show, we'll take a picture with you.  What the hell?  Sometimes.  I have to leave very quickly after the show.  Boston Strangler.  Yeah.  Great job, buddy.  Yep.  Thank you very much.  I would say those guys are in the lead.  All right.  Yeah, definitely.  Botched attempt on private property.  Botched attempt. 
[00:52:00]  I almost got her once in Foxborough.  I like how that other guy becomes a thug.  Yeah.  Like what they're doing is legal.  Right, right.  And then this thug comes in.  This thug.  The nerve of him.  The nerve of this security.  Oh, man.  We love the assault of the media thing.  So check out the video on opianthony.com.  Also, I just was handed a note.  The blind boxing is up for your viewing pleasure.  There you go.  On opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  All right.  Very nice.  Proffy, Simo.  A couple of people want to comment. 
[00:52:30]  Paul from Chicago.  What's up?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I'm in Chicago, and these pricks from Fox News do the same damn show every morning.  It's the Fox Chicago morning show.  They put on these gimmicks, these acts, jugglers, you know, line dancers, whatever they can think  of.  And it's pretty obnoxious.  But it's the same time every morning.  So I don't know if everybody's listening from Chicago, but if you're planning on assaulting  media, it's probably a good time to do it.  They do it on, I think, the corner of Michigan Avenue and Lake Street, maybe. 
[00:53:00]  Lake and Michigan.  There you go.  Bill, we have pests everywhere.  We have pests everywhere.  Yeah.  Nationwide.  Just looking for that opportunity.  Just sitting and waiting.  There's no reason to put an eye, except that they have nothing else to report on in Chicago,  so they just put on these stupid gimmick acts.  Right.  Anybody who's anybody with an act can go on there and just, hey, I got something.  Yeah, I'd like to see an assault on the media in Chicago.  That would be nice.  I'll try to work on it. 
[00:53:30]  It would be some awful news to watch.  All right.  Jugglers.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  What year?  Plates spinners.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got a guy who's going to spin some plates up here on a stick.  It's going to be fantastic.  Andy, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How's it going?  All right, Andy.  I would suggest that everybody that wants to do an assault on the media, watch that one.  It was beautifully diagrammed.  If you do it with two people, you always have one person that has to sacrifice their body when the big thug comes.  That's true. 
[00:54:00]  That guy took the guy out with the sign last night, something fierce.  I was sitting watching with my wife.  I'm laughing my ass off.  And my wife just looked at me going, that's not funny.  Yes, it is.  It is certainly funny.  Fucking broads.  They don't get it.  They're just anti-fun.  They are.  And when he's right on top of Bianca with the sign and the camera starts doing that MTV thing,  she kind of looks down to the corner and winces. 
[00:54:30]  And then they go to the serious story.  The whole thing was, the whole story after that was,  I guess a big sheet of ice fell off a truck on the Mass Pike  and went through some poor lady's windshield and, like, took her eye out and broke her jaw and all that.  We are.  Yeah, exactly.  You're kidding.  No.  That's not.  But, yeah, they should definitely diagram it.  All right.  Have one guy take it, and that's about it.  All right.  Have a wonderful day.  All I know is the assaults on the media are getting smarter and better as we move on. 
[00:55:00]  That sounds like a real topical news story.  Ice blowing off a car on the Mass Pike.  It's summer.  What the hell is going on?  What are they talking about?  Last year?  I have no idea.  All right.  Let's go to New Jersey.  Brad, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  I just heard some disturbing news from Howard this morning already.  He claims, first off, that he would never deny anybody a job anywhere he works.  Then he has the balls to say that when serious management came to him, they said, Opie and Anthony want to work here. 
[00:55:30]  Andrew Dice Clay wants to work here.  And Howard says he gave a textbook answer by saying, yeah, that's fine.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Truth of the matter is, we were hired here before he was hired there.  We had a job here before he was hired at Syria.  So what kind of discussions were going on?  We were employed. 
[00:56:00]  The deals were done.  First of all, people, you know, he was bitching that another station took his show off the air.  So then they got into talking about the little doggy station, and that's one of the things that came up.  And, of course, Bubba Bucktooth, he was like, yes, yes, Buff, that's right, Buff, totally kissing his ass.  Just annoying.  I feel really, really sorry for Bubba the Love Sponge that he had to go and kiss Howard's ass to get back on the radio.  You know something?  Thanks a lot, but we've had the experience of working for the same company that Howard works for. 
[00:56:30]  It's no treat.  Let me tell you that one.  And that's why I couldn't believe he said it, and I have to hop on the horn right away and notify you guys.  You think if Bubba thinks it was a bad thing having Clear Channel up his ass as far as content goes and what he's doing on his show,  just wait until Stern starts micromanaging his other stations and telling these guys what they should or shouldn't be doing.  Oof, what a fucking nightmare that would be.  Thank you, no.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, that guy before me went to, he stole my thunder. 
[00:57:00]  I was going to say the same thing, that douchebag Stern came on the air,  and he was whining and bitching about how he's getting thrown off the air in Columbus,  and the program director came on and gave a big spiel about it.  I guess he didn't prepare for a show today again.  Well, he just phoned it in.  I just wish YSD would throw him off the fucking air down here.  All right.  Ain't a matter of time there, buddy.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  Yeah, I heard the same damn thing. 
[00:57:30]  Matt Hook knows.  He's awful.  He's a liar.  We could have went to either Sirius or XM.  We went here.  It is kind of nice to know.  If we fuck up, we got one more place to go.  This guy.  I couldn't believe it.  I was going to drive off the road when he said that you guys wanted to go to Sirius.  Wait a minute.  Last time I checked, you guys have been on XM for a year.  No, you know what?  We were lucky enough to be able to choose between the two companies,  and sorry, but XM is the much better company.  So, stupid us, we decided to go with the better company. 
[00:58:00]  Mama.  But once in our lives, we made a smart decision.  We went to the better company.  Mama.  Bobby in Brooklyn.  What's up, Bobby?  Hey, what's up, boy?  Basically, same story.  I was on there fucking crying this morning.  But, I mean.  Well, he cries and bitches when he doesn't have a show to do.  Yeah.  So, he goes into that old barrel like, well, I didn't prepare for a show, 
[00:58:30]  because why should I at this point?  So, I'll just spend my time bitching about the FCC, bitching about my, uh, what?  Guy's going to throw any parties in New York.  I need a good party to go to.  I was just about to give you a really good rant, sir.  That's what happens.  All right.  Why don't we say hi to Jennifer?  We've got to bring the fun back into the show here.  Jennifer in Texas.  What's up, Jennifer?  Hello.  Hey.  Hi.  Hi.  I wanted to play What's in My Pants. 
[00:59:00]  Whoa.  I like the sound of this.  You know something?  Another game we haven't played in a long time.  For some reason, the girls just hadn't been calling in to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Jimmy's gone.  Look at that.  Girl calls out of nowhere to play this game.  Of course.  Jimmy is the cock blocker of this.  I think Jimmy's scaring the girls.  He is absolutely.  When girls walk in here and they look at Jimmy,  he looks like he could be a problem, is what it is.  Like, if they start taking their clothes off, it's going to end in a rape. 
[00:59:30]  I really don't know why the listeners aren't listening today.  Jim's the next bird man in Alcatraz.  Right.  Shaves all his hair off.  He's a nice guy.  If you drink a lot, he's nice looking.  So you guys are called listeners.  So your number one job is to listen.  To listen.  You're not talkers.  You're not talkers.  You're supposed to listen first and then talk.  Sorry.  That's okay.  All right.  So why don't we play.  We have the song? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, we have the song.  Bill, you don't know what this is all about.  No, but I like the sound of it.  You can play along.  It's going to be great.  Song.  Song.  Let's start with the song.  Mama.  He's time to play.  He's time to play.  He's time to play.  Guess what's in my pants.  Place the receiver.  A cough on your beaver.  It's time to play.  Guess what's in my pants.  It's time. 
[01:00:30]  Guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  Makes it all legitimate, doesn't it?  Oh, absolutely.  When you have a song that starts the whole thing rolling.  Of course it does.  Plus it sounds like it's from the golden age, like the 1950s.  Doesn't it?  Like you picked some engineer with a big set of headphones turning big dials to play that song.  People pointing.  You're on.  You're on.  Big on the air light blinking.  Applause.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  We're here live.  Ladies and gentlemen, all the ships at sea. 
[01:01:00]  Very good.  You are Frexa.  Jennifer, what do you look like, by the way?  Uh, I am a dirty blonde.  Filthy.  Uh, 34 double D's.  Uh-huh.  Are they real?  34 double D's.  Well, Texas is, uh.  Very small frame.  Yeah, big boobs, small frame.  Texas is known for the breast.  Yeah, we're known for that.  Are you a petite gal height-wise? 
[01:01:30]  Actually, yeah.  I'm 5'3".  5'3".  How much do you weigh?  Uh, 130.  Do you have Ben Gay on your back?  130.  Fat ankles.  No?  She's got a shape, uh, I would say, the way she talks.  And how old are you?  I'm 25.  25?  I picture her looking like the old, uh, remember Charlene Tilton?  She was petite height-wise.  Big set of cans, right?  Yeah.  The girl from Swan hair. 
[01:02:00]  She was in, uh, Dallas, I think.  Man, it's hard job to make these girls...  I'm only 25, but I remember Dallas.  ...sound hotter.  No, I'm just trying to go, uh, with the, the...  Because back in the olden days, Charlene Tilton wasn't that bad.  She had thighs.  How about the girl from Swan hair?  She did, I know, but that's what I'm saying.  This girl's probably...  You got a little thigh action?  No, actually, I don't.  No?  There's something slightly wrong with you, because 5'3", 130...  The pain is in the, in the mid-section, so... 
[01:02:30]  See, Charlene Tilton.  You got a belly?  No.  Mid-section is like, wouldn't that be the...  Do you just go straight down?  It would be the belly and the, and the ass and the tit, yes.  So you got, your ass is a little big.  No, I would go more...  Lumpy?  No, actually, it's when, when I gain in the boobs, I gain in the stomach.  Oh, boy.  This game is falling apart.  No, no, it's still perfect, Opie.  Stop.  Don't ruin it.  We barely got the... 
[01:03:00]  When you, when you...  The nails are wobbling.  Yeah, she needs something for her titties to rest on.  No, I'm okay.  It doesn't look like...  Hey, Jennifer, it doesn't look like you were sitting in a gravel driveway, got up, brushed  the gravel off, and your ass looks like that, does it?  No.  Okay, good.  You're not going to be featured in Cellulite Horror Stories.  Those many things that they got as they're trying to check out at the grocery store.  Yeah.  God, are those the best.  The bikini bottoms just hanging off.  They found one lousy, like, butt, uh, what, indentation, I guess. 
[01:03:30]  Yes, a little dimple.  On, uh, Jessica Simpson, and they had to circle it.  Wow.  And this is the cover of one of these magazines in the supermarket yesterday.  Look what's, look what's going on with her ass.  Look what's starting.  Dude, this tiny, I mean, this thing was barely noticeable, but they made a big circle, an arrow.  Guess whose butt this is.  She's throwing up in a mansion somewhere in the United States right now.  Yeah, yeah, just losing her mind.  Right.  You, uh, Jennifer, do you own a loofah? 
[01:04:00]  No.  Oh, good.  Jesus, Anthony.  What's that?  No, the thing you're finding pictures.  Don't turn it off, though, Than.  Do what?  All right.  Who is that?  Is that Charlene Tilton?  Doesn't look like her.  I don't know.  Not in the face.  Yeah, that's her.  That didn't look like her.  That's definitely her.  See the big, meaty thigh?  How old is that picture?  Not yet.  She was kind of hot for five minutes.  Jennifer?  Back in, uh, 75 or something.  Jennifer?  Yes?  Have you, uh, had a kid?  No.  No way.  That's good.  All right, that'll help. 
[01:04:30]  All right, I guess we're going to play Guess What's in My Pants with Jennifer from Texas.  All right, let me explain the rules for those of you that...  I understand the rules.  Well, our listeners, our other listeners...  It's not about you.  Jennifer, you're a listener.  I know it's not about me.  Go ahead.  You must listen.  Silence.  Silencio.  Okay, here's the rules for those of you that don't know how to play.  Uh, we will instruct Jennifer to take her phone...  Do you like saying that name?  No.  Yeah.  I write a check out when I say that name.  We will instruct Jennifer... 
[01:05:00]  Sorry to make your ex-wife's name.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Uh, to rub the phone on her most intimate of areas...  Yeah.  ...in various different ways, uh, to try to guess what type of hairstyle she's sporting down  there, just based on the sound that comes from the phone.  Uh, the, the choices are the basic, standard, government-issue triangle that all the women,  uh, start out with.  The mohawk, which is, you know, it's self-explanatory. 
[01:05:30]  They shave the sides off, so it's just a mohawk.  The, uh, Hitler mustache, which is, uh, starts off like a mohawk, but then they just shave  it down more from the belly button down to the, uh, clit area, so it's a little, what  they call Hitler mustache.  Right.  It looks like a little Hitler mustache down there, which, by the way, looks completely  ridiculous.  Yeah.  Hence the name, Hitler mustache.  We, uh, we tried calling it the Charlie Chaplin, but it's not as funny as the Hitler mustache.  That's right.  And the Hitler mustache, by the way, looks completely ridiculous on girls when they, uh, spread their 
[01:06:00]  legs apart.  We had an exclamation point in the studio yesterday.  Did you see that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was a little.  It was really long.  Yeah.  Long.  Yeah.  The Hitler mustache looks like that thing Stevie Ray Vaughan had underneath his body.  Yeah.  Just a little thing.  Kind of hangs out there.  When the girls spread their legs and they have that there, it looks silly.  We could change it.  Like they missed.  We could change it to the, uh, the soul patch.  Mm-hmm.  That's what that's called.  The soul patch.  A little soul patch.  Yeah.  It was just such a great reference.  Hitler.  Yeah.  He barely gets any, uh, mentions these days, so we call it the Hitler mustache. 
[01:06:30]  And, of course, he really fell off, didn't he?  Yeah, he did.  His popularity.  Lash in the pan.  Then there is the, um, what we call the wood floor, which is completely clean shaved wood  floor.  Or, it's also been known, uh, to be called on this program, the JonBenet Ramsey, we like  to call it the, well, you know, just because we can.  We can now call it the Bill Burr disgusted look on his face. 
[01:07:00]  I know, you know, I always say, no, he always feels bad.  He always, uh, I'm sorry.  What can I tell you, Bill?  I love it.  It's better than what Jimmy called it.  He called it Connor Peterson's armpit.  That's why he has cockroaches.  It's all karma.  Uh, Jennifer, of course, as we are guessing, the worst thing you could possibly do is give  us any clues or hints by saying no or yes or something stupid like that.  So you must remain silent until we ask you what indeed you do have down your pants. 
[01:07:30]  Uh, I got my underwear down to my ankles.  Where are you?  At my apartment.  What kind of underwear?  Uh, I guess they're regular, not like old lady underwear, but like briefs, I guess.  Briefs?  Well, I don't know.  It's not like thong.  I don't know what it's called.  You wear big underwear down there in Texas?  No.  This is like when you're trying to have phone sex with a girl, right?  And you're already rolling your eyes as your dick is starting to slowly go down. 
[01:08:00]  What are you wearing?  I don't know.  Underwear.  It's a standard issue.  Just underwear.  Got it at the Walmart in an eight-pack.  All right.  There's nothing sexy coming out of Walmart.  Three for $20.  And this mom would buy the five-pack with the guy in the front.  All right.  Well, the wheels are falling off, so let's start the game.  All right, Jennifer, if you would take the phone now, rub it in an up-and-down fashion a few times. 
[01:08:30]  Okay.  All right.  Listen.  Okay.  All right.  Now, if we could have the side-to-side rub.  Okay.  Could you do that a little slower, side-to-side, like five times?  Okay.  This is important.  All right.  Could you use it in a sentence? 
[01:09:00]  Now, in the most important, circular fashion.  Okay.  Okay.  Barely hear it.  Did you get that?  Are you pushing hard enough?  Push kind of hard on the phone and rub in a circle.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  There you go.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  To the ladies, when we ask for the circular motion, you've got to do it like you're making a crop circle. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  You've got to really get in there.  I was.  Yeah.  I think I got it.  I think I know.  Okay.  Who wants to guess first?  I'm going to go with the landing strip.  You're going with the landing strip, the mohawk?  Yeah.  There's something going on there.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with the, um...  There's a five o'clock shadow thing happening there, though.  You think?  Yeah.  That's the problem with this game.  I'm going to go with, uh...  Hitler mustache.  Hitler mustache. 
[01:10:00]  I am agreeing with Bill over there.  I think I heard, especially in the circular, what sounded like...  It was a certain sound, almost like a, uh, like you said, like a five o'clock shadow.  But then, it was this little...  Little wispy.  Thud.  Little thud thing that happened.  Little wispy thud every time she went around.  And I also heard it at the top and the bottom of her rotation, which means it's not a Hitler mustache.  You'd only hear it on one side of the rotation.  Wow.  Look at your ears.  He's got good ears, huh?  I think what I'm hearing is a mohawk. 
[01:10:30]  Um, anyone else?  Van, you like to, uh, join in since you're sitting there?  Uh, I'm sorry.  With your impeccable reasoning, I have to stick with the landing strip.  Landing strip also?  Which would be the mohawk?  Okay.  Mohawk.  Okay.  Uh, Jennifer, if you would, at this time, please tell us what you have in your pants.  You all suck.  I have a finely groomed regular triangle.  Ah!  Damn it, you know what?  That was going to be my first answer.  Damn, a triangle.  It's just a regular groomed triangle. 
[01:11:00]  That's what I heard, the five o'clock shadow.  Wow.  Damn it.  We all sucked out on that one.  Yeah.  I must have been doing a triangle.  You should have knew you were wrong if you were going with what I was saying.  Oh, no.  It was, believe me, it wasn't based on what you said.  It was based on my own, uh, reasoning, which sucked.  I must have just heard the, uh, boy, what were you doing?  Rotating it up to your thighs and back?  No.  I heard, I heard something.  I heard that, too, but I thought it was just like a five o'clock shadow thing. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I did.  Just what you thought, dude.  We don't get many triangles, so that's good to throw that in there as a little, uh, goof.  Very good.  You tricked us.  But it's not the Earth Mama Muff.  It's just the regular finely groomed triangle.  We understand, Jennifer.  Jennifer from Texas, thanks for playing Guess What's in My Pants.  It's time to play, it's time to play, it's time to play, hey, guess what's in my pants.  Yes. 
[01:12:00]  Place a receiver upon your beaver.  Yes.  It's time to play, hey, guess what's in my pants.  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I'm in a good mood, mood, because his stupid socks are winning and winning and winning.  Seven games in a row, two games in a row.  Ben doesn't even do jokes at you, though.  He'll just, like, list a fact.  He just does that. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, dude.  Seven games in a row.  Seven games.  That's a lot of comedian.  Seven games.  Isn't that wonderful?  And the Yankees' big thing is they have to, like, oh, they didn't get swept by the Mets.  Oh, I love it.  And they're talking like it's the best thing ever.  Yeah.  Great.  We'll have a big meeting with the boss of Tampa tomorrow.  I know.  It's going to be things done.  Steinbrenner and Tampa.  I'm sick of them.  I'm glad they're getting their faces smashed.  I don't want to see Giambi and Randy Johnson in Yankee uniforms.  Can there be no just enemies of your goddamn team?  Holy shit, is that aggravating. 
[01:13:00]  A-Rod's having me right here, though.  A-Rod.  Definitely.  I like A-Rod only because he was a bat for bat.  But why?  Stop buying it.  I never was one of these guys that said the Yankees bought the team.  I was never one of these guys.  No.  I like farm system guys.  Fuck.  Ring them up.  Somebody you can watch over the years and appreciate their growth.  Well, there's talk they're going to trade their top three picks.  Of course they will.  For who?  For some pitcher.  Either Barry Zito.  There you go.  Barry Zito sucks my dick. 
[01:13:30]  Top three picks, Jim.  Like the top three prospects in the organization.  They're talking about trading.  Jesus Christ.  They deserve to get the shit beat out of them for that.  Goddamn Steinbrenner.  When he was out of baseball, this team was built up and they won three out of four years.  Oh, is that frustrating?  Yes, it is.  God damn it.  Can we take one year where you just admit like, all right, this is going to be an off year where you let some of that young talent develop?  Any team.  Pick your team around the country.  You'd rather give up the young talent, get a name, and flounder. 
[01:14:00]  That fucking Barry Zito, I can't tell you how, I'd rather have Bob Kelly's leg pitching for the Yankees than that fucking Barry Zito.  Cocksucker, that's aggravating.  Catch my fist bump.  I hurt my dynasty, man.  God damn it, is that frustrating.  Fucking Barry Zito.  And Randy Johnson, what do you have in this?  That's one guy they're talking about.  They're talking about a bunch of different pitchers, but he's one of the ones that's taking that.  Yeah, who are we bringing Jim Abbott back, cocksucker? 
[01:14:30]  Bob O'Hita.  Holy God, is that aggravating.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I know you want what's on my mind.  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know the issue of this time.  I know you know, you know, you know.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  And they wonder why no one goes anymore. 
[01:15:00]  Bill Burr in studio.  His HBO comedy special is on tomorrow night.  At midnight.  At midnight?  That's right.  Make sure you check out Bill Burr on HBO.  I got HBO on demand, so I can watch it like a million times.  After it airs.  I'm very, very happy about that.  I'm going to hold you to that.  I love the on demand thing.  I can't get enough of it.  That's the future.  The future.  Sure.  I want him to get to that point where any movie you want to see is available on demand  through your cable provider or something. 
[01:15:30]  Where you can just, you know, you pop it in and it's there.  Yeah.  What are we waiting for?  That's going to be soon.  And that's why you just stop buying DVDs.  Yeah.  That's going to be like your cassette tapes that I still have.  All the VCR tapes.  Oh.  Just piling up.  And audio cassettes.  Oh, yeah.  Useless magnetic tape.  It's funny you say that because I've been unpacking a bunch of CDs lately.  Uh-huh.  And I'm going, this is a waste.  Why do I have CDs?  Oh, yeah.  You don't need those anymore.  Why would you have CDs anymore? 
[01:16:00]  I've noticed that at college.  With the iPods and the MP3s.  Yeah.  When I go to sell my CD afterwards, is that a DVD?  You're like, no, it's a CD.  Like, literally, like, three months ago, all of a sudden, it's like, CD.  I have an 8-track.  What is this?  I have a record.  A record.  And some hot wax here for you, kids.  A lot of our stuff is now available on audible.com.  So the kids just go there, download the show.  We're going to have, like, you know, best of.  It's perfect.  So even, like, when the iPod is over, the next thing it comes, you just fucking throw that out. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, just throw it away.  It's not this whole closet shit.  We're getting to the point where you really, everything will be available digitally,  and you won't need the hard copies of this way to transfer it from what it is, you know, music or DVD,  to the viewing source, your television or stereo or whatever the hell you're doing.  It's just delivered digitally, and that's it, right from the provider to what you have to watch it on.  It's getting close to that.  I was reading a Popular Mechanics the other day, Opie. 
[01:17:00]  That's where I get a lot of my information from.  And I like when they look back, they take a look back 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 50 years ago,  and show what Popular Mechanics was featuring.  And they showed 30 years ago or something, they had a cable.  They showed cable television.  And they had this smiling family around their old colored television set with one of those boxes that were connected with the cable,  with the wire that your drunk friends used to trip over,  and they would fling off your coffee table like a weapon across the room. 
[01:17:30]  And there were 33 channels on that box, and they were crowing about it.  And then Popular Mechanics predicted that in the future we could have, could have, up to 100 channels available.  Amazing, isn't it, what they were thinking back then?  God, you read, he reads Popular Mechanic magazine, and I'm reading Us Weekly.  It is the best for the bowl.  I read People magazine on the plane. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, People magazine, you know, Popular Mechanics.  I was saying, it's like watching TV.  You don't even have to think.  You finish the crossword, you feel like a fucking genius.  You know what it is?  It's starred with Alan Alda in MASH, pictured in the corner.  Like, that isn't easy enough.  I still can never finish the fucking thing, because there's always some sort of, like,  co-starred with Bob Denver on Far Out Space Nuts.  You're like, fuck!  That's the only one I need!  Yeah, I can't get that one.  God damn it.  So true.  So true. 
[01:18:30]  Dude, you know, speaking of, like, all the record things,  when did all of a sudden, like, I had to, you know, buy a fancy shirt here.  Yes.  To go do my TV thing.  Every fucking clothing store you go into now, they have a DJ in there.  And he's spinning stuff.  Spinning at the clothing store.  Yeah.  Go in there at 11 in the morning, and they're playing these raunchy stuff.  The F-word's just flying.  Real?  What store are you going to?  I was on Melrose Avenue.  They were playing, they actually, he had, like, the Outkast CD, the Andre 3000 one.  Yeah.  And there was some girl talking about whether she was a whore or not. 
[01:19:00]  You know?  I don't know who it was, but, you know.  That could have been any record.  But I wanted some dick.  Saying, like, shit like that, and you're walking in there like,  that's what you're like.  Yeah, I'm going to buy a shirt.  Maybe I'll get the pants, too, man.  This is infectious.  I swear to you, I'm really going to sound like an old person here,  but it's like the whole thing now.  It's just this whole big hype of fucking nothing.  Like, I watched, like, the VMAs, and it's like,  if half those whores could sing, they could put some fucking clothes on.  They're, like, running through showers.  They're lowering them from the ceiling. 
[01:19:30]  There's, like, you know, synchronized midgets dancing.  It's like, you're not fooling me.  You can't fucking sing.  Right.  Kelly Clarkson sounded like a drunk whore at karaoke.  Just screeching this fucking song with their ass crack hanging out.  It's true.  Yep.  They hype nothing.  It's so true.  And we could segue into the Britney Spears thing.  She just took herself out of the game.  She officially had her stupid shit.  She's done.  Oh, it's over.  Announce her retirement.  It's done.  Announce her retirement, yeah.  You're known as a sex symbol, so what do you do?  You go and wreck your body. 
[01:20:00]  Not only did she get pregnant, and from what I heard in things like People magazine, she  tacked on a lot of pounds, extra pounds that even other pregnant women don't put on this  much weight, and she got a C-section.  It'd be bad enough if she delivered it the normal way and blew out her pussy.  Right.  Blew out.  But you could at least, like, you'd forget after a while. 
[01:20:30]  She got in shape, and now it's just like.  New name for a whack bag.  Blew out her pussy.  Blown out pussy.  Blown out pussy.  Blew it out.  But the C-section.  A.K.A. Mothers of America.  C-section, yes, Anthony.  She gets the C-section, which now, you know, I know there are a lot of ladies out there that  have gotten the C-section.  It is one of the sacrifices you have made in your life to have a child, but there is  no way you're going to convince anybody that it is sexy, that it looks good. 
[01:21:00]  But they do it right along the bikini line, eh?  No, no, they don't.  They always got to yank them up like an old man.  Right.  Exactly.  You got to have the one piece.  She has to wear the one piece now because, you know, the paparazzi, they're just waiting  for her to stretch and that scar to come up.  Right.  So they can circle it.  Exactly.  How hot is it when a girl wears those little boy short bikini bottoms and they're pulled 
[01:21:30]  down to where you're just starting to see where the hair would be?  Well, the latest fad is sweat.  When they grow up.  The latest fad is sweatpants rolled down.  Right.  Rolled down a few times.  Right down to the pubic mound.  Oh, yeah.  Right down to it.  And they're not doing it for us either.  I love when they say that shit.  I don't dress like that.  I do it for myself.  Makes me feel good.  I feel good.  So what?  Brittany's going to go back on stage in a one piece now?  My tits mush together.  And we're all going to go to the concerts to listen to her talent now? 
[01:22:00]  Listen to her lip sync.  Stop.  Because that's what she does live.  She lip syncs.  And the only reason people were going was because she got in a bathtub.  I saw it.  She had some Showtime thing or whatever it was.  I watched the entire thing.  Oh, my God.  She gets in a bathtub.  She's wearing this skin-tight bikini thing.  And the bikini is the color of her skin.  So it looks like she's naked.  They should have just sharpied in some pubes on that thing and some nipples.  Because it looked like she was nude.  And she's in this bathtub.  And then she has fake sex with a big black guy on a bed that comes flying out from the ceiling. 
[01:22:30]  Nothing to do with her singing.  Nothing.  I was watching it with the sound turned down.  You didn't even need to hear this crap.  With my cack in my hand.  My cack in my fucking hand is broad.  Is fucking a black guy.  Oh!  She's doing what amounts to a live sex show.  I want to congratulate Christina Aguilera.  She officially wins.  You win.  Yes, she wins.  You win.  She won what we call the Tiffany... 
[01:23:00]  Oh, shit!  I wish I could remember her fucking name.  Tiffany and...  Debbie Gibson.  Debbie Gibson.  Open.  Yes.  Remember that one?  Remember that battle?  They were like, who's going to last longer, Tiffany or Debbie Gibson?  That was a much more evenly matched...  Was it, you think?  Yeah.  They were both slobs.  Oh, Debbie Gibson, I think, went a little further than Tiffany did.  She went to Broadway.  Oh, I thought you meant Playboy, but they...  No, they both wound up taking their clothes off long after anyone wanted to see them. 
[01:23:30]  But, man, Brittany...  I know.  Brittany's people must have been...  They always do that.  Brittany's people must have been just thinking, what the fuck are you doing?  Top of your career, you're fucking up your body.  Soon to be out of work, people.  They're going to have no job.  I like women always, like, complain about...  Oh, there's so many, like...  They exploit us for our bodies, and the second any one of them make it, they do the fucking  whore spread.  Yeah.  And the very least, Rolling Stone.  Remember Jennifer Aniston, like, two fingers over her nipples, ass crack hanging out? 
[01:24:00]  That's it.  Ass.  She was laying down on her stomach.  I remember that shot.  It was very tasteful.  It was very tasteful.  Ass shot showing.  Spooge just falling on those pages all across the country.  I like the ones that, you know, during their early 20s, they're popular.  They do nothing.  They just show no skin whatsoever.  And they fall off the map.  They become has-beens.  Maybe they get picked up on some reality show.  They're now in their 40s and decide, just as a freeing experience, I decided to do Playboy. 
[01:24:30]  Farrah Fawcett.  Yeah, there's a perfect example.  50, what, two?  And she finally decides to take it off.  And then, like, Oprah will come on and actually say that it's hot.  I think it's hot.  This is great.  50's hot.  You look better now than you ever have, girlfriend.  That's right.  Farrah.  No, you don't.  Thanks for throwing us a bone.  Yeah.  Jesus.  52 or something like that, she finally decides.  I'll tell you, if you're going to bang a 52-year-old.  Yeah, you want to go with the Farrah?  Oh, yeah.  What about Elle McPherson in the paper today? 
[01:25:00]  42 years old.  Yeah, 42.  They showed her on the beach.  Looks amazing.  42.  Amazing.  Absolutely.  That's genetically.  You tell me, if you've got the personal chef, that's the thing.  That's what it is, the personal chef.  Yeah, they just stick in front of you as you're hungry.  You just eat it, and then you're not hungry.  You know, I have Donald's voice goes away.  You're not a personal chef.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Comes to my house.  Anthony's a fancy person.  Comes to my house and cooks for the week.  And everything is... 
[01:25:30]  Puts in little Tupperwares.  Everything is in little Tupperwares, all labeled, all labeled what it is.  I just got to go.  I throw it in the oven.  I don't microwave it, mind you.  It's kind of a funny taste.  Scene.  An all-white room.  Just slides out of the wall.  A long pushing shot to the oven.  Yeah.  Through this long cavernous kitchen.  Some classical music playing in the background, and some whore fingers herself by a cupboard. 
[01:26:00]  As I'm opening my pristine Tupperware.  Latex gloves on.  Oh, is that perfect?  You've completely gotten me down.  That's it.  Hey, moving backwards a little bit.  Back to technology.  Yes.  Well, this is what kind of started us on the whole thing.  I got the September 16th issue of Entertainment Weekly.  Just trying to keep up on...  That's a hot issue.  Trying to keep up on pop culture.  You know how it is, right? 
[01:26:30]  As long as you don't have to wrap them in plastic.  And I'm leafing through this thing like this, you know, checking out the pages.  No big deal.  Moving along, right?  Mm-hmm.  And it's...  I'm, you know, by myself.  It's kind of nighttime, so it's starting to get a little creepy.  A little creepy at night?  Everything gets a little creepier as the sun goes down.  And I'm sitting there reading the magazine, and I turn the page.  And listen what ha...  Yeah, exactly.  Listen what happened.  My name is Earl.  Do good things, and good things happen to you. 
[01:27:00]  Do bad things, and I'll come back to haunt you.  I'm talking about karma.  My name is Earl.  Dudes, I jumped.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Why is the magazine talking to me?  That could shake you up in a quiet room.  Have you guys seen this yet?  Has anyone else seen these things yet?  Because you know this is a new trend.  This isn't one of those things like, hey, let's try this.  It's working, and now your magazine is going to be talking to you.  Oh, it's perfect.  You don't have to read.  They just turn in and send a mush.  Imagine you just have it set up where you turn the page, and it just will read to you now.  The entire page will be read to you. 
[01:27:30]  Nothing written on it.  I'm going to tell you right now, violence in airports is going to increase.  It's already bad enough you have douchebags talking too loud on their cell phones.  On their fucking cell phones.  Ugh.  But I turned the page.  Obviously, it's an ad for this new show, Earl.  Yeah.  But as you turn the page, it trips a switch or whatever.  It's a good idea for the show.  And...  My name is Earl.  Do good things, and good things happen to you.  Do bad things, and I'll come back to haunt you.  I'm talking about karma.  My name is Earl. 
[01:28:00]  I'm amazed.  Try turning the page.  And I'll tell you, that's all I need to know.  I'm watching that show.  That's it.  Now I'm tuning in.  They have figured out...  But they should have a warning on the front page of the front cover of the magazine that  the thing's going to talk to you.  In a quiet room when you're not expecting any noise.  That'll scare you.  All of a sudden, something starts talking.  Ah, the Jennifer Aniston picture with her ass.  Wow.  Yeah, remember that one?  The cover of Rolling Stone, right on the cover.  Let me see.  She got her ass just a little.  Wow.  Out of focus a little bit. 
[01:28:30]  That is a very hot picture, by the way.  That is really hot.  You're going to spank that hiney.  Some think she's hotter than...  That's going back a couple of years.  I wouldn't hook up with anybody who fucked Billy Bob Thornton.  I'll tell you, I called Pamela Anderson, too.  I remember that.  I said I wouldn't fuck anybody who fucked Tommy Lee.  And what does she get?  Hepatitis.  The hep.  The hep.  Yep.  She's got something going on, though, because she just hangs out with all her old boyfriends.  All of them. 
[01:29:00]  Recently, she was with Tommy Lee, and there were rumors that she was going to marry him  again in Vegas.  Kid Rock.  And then there was a picture of her with Kid Rock very recently.  And then she married her dogs in Malibu with her old boyfriend that was the surfer.  All within like a week.  Yeah.  She just jumps around from ex-boyfriend to ex-boyfriend.  And they're all fine with it for some reason.  Probably all have the hep.  She must be a great lay.  But there it is.  They put commercials in magazines.  You had your advertising, which you could, you know, you just thumb through.  Now there's just audio commercials in magazines. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  I bet Drew Boogie could play that.  Make it sound good.  Wait, you got one in Rolling Stone, too?  No way.  A little bit slightly different.  Is that Jack on the bar?  Ah, don't.  That's bad.  It goes.  Ah.  When something we can't explain occurs, we deny it.  But somewhere in the dark corners of our mind, we believe. 
[01:30:00]  You know what's out there?  I swore I was done hunting for good.  Supernatural.  The WB.  Tuesdays this fall.  WB.  Holy shit.  That lights up, too, huh?  Yeah, the headlights light up.  There's lights on.  Now that would have scared the shit out of you.  The headlights on the car light up.  That is so weird.  Thank God you got the comedy.  Exactly.  The scary one.  Am I late to the party?  When did this start?  Did this just start, like, this week or this month?  It must have.  Years ago, that would have taken an entire room of equipment to get a sound like that. 
[01:30:30]  Now it's in a magazine.  So there's one in the latest Rolling Stone magazine.  Those little chips were the size of a freight car.  Let's say hi to Sammy and Queen.  Sammy!  Hey, Opie and Bill.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Listen, that same shit happened to me at Entertainment Weekly.  Yeah.  Then I opened last night.  I'm watching the Yankees.  I get my new Rolling Stone.  That supernatural shit with the headlights looking at me.  Yeah, Ben just played that for us.  That was pretty creepy.  Yeah, but you know, this started about a couple years ago with the Sopranos. 
[01:31:00]  Really?  I had opened a magazine, Rolling Stone or something, and then all of a sudden the theme song came on loud.  It just scares the hell out of me.  Well, now that they got the technology, obviously someone figured it out where it's just a slightly thicker page of paper.  That's all it is.  Right, right.  It's like maybe the size of five pieces of, you know, paper.  I hate to use this word, but where is the mechanism?  Yeah, where is the mechanism?  You know what it is?  It's a little battery, I think, inside that thick paper. 
[01:31:30]  Open it up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there it is.  It's a cyborg!  Ah!  Look at it.  It's got...  That is a little archaic.  I thought it was smaller than that.  Yeah.  There's a printed circuit board.  There's two wire leads leading to a speaker.  A little speaker.  And then there's...  He just contaminated the room.  What are those batteries on there?  What?  Three batteries?  Three good things and good things happen to you.  You have an Opie.  A mechanical switch. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Let me see that thing.  The Opie magazine, there was a DVD for the new Chris Rock show at the beginning, right?  Yeah, I saw that, too.  So I thought the Earl thing was also a DVD.  Okay.  And that's what scared the fuck out of me.  Yeah, that is so weird.  That's just sick.  That's just sick.  It's a little big.  It's still a little big, but...  It's a little big.  They've got to get that technology a little better.  Oh, they will.  This is like the inside of a transistor radio.  Yeah, if you're putting out a magazine and you need a soldering iron, it's a little big.  But you know how this goes. 
[01:32:30]  That's the start of it, and they'll figure out how to make that smaller immediately.  But still, the point I'm making, it's not that thick, that section of the magazine that pulls that off for the new show, Earl, or whatever it is.  No, they're going for a new level of, like, irritating things.  Like, I was telling you guys earlier, it's like the third time someone approached me, they're like, you want to have, like, part of your act be like a cell phone ring, you know?  A ring cone, yeah.  Comedians be like cell phone rings.  Yeah.  There's no quicker way to become, like, overexposed and fucking irritating. 
[01:33:00]  Burn out your shit.  You might be a redneck, him.  You might be a redneck, him.  Hold on, my phone's ringing.  Ring tones.  And they're not going to stop, they're not going to have a law or something.  The magazine's going to be filled with these things.  You're going to have at least ten in each magazine.  Every time you turn the page, one's still going to be yapping, the next page is going to start talking over it.  Yeah, because now it's going to sound like a big loud conversation going on.  It's obviously a great idea, it's a brand new idea, we're talking about it. 
[01:33:30]  You've got to think all these ad agencies are jumping on the bandwagon, you know, trying to get fit.  Well, does it make you want to watch the show?  No, it made me want to throw the magazine at the TV.  All right, we're doing a little marketing research here.  Yes, well, you know what, they're just squeezing in advertising everywhere for everything, like we were saying about the movie theater.  You used to go to the movies and you'd see the previews and then the movie.  Now it's loaded with the same commercials that you see at home on television.  And it started out they would just play one a few years back. 
[01:34:00]  Now you sit there and have to sit through a shitload of regular, you know, Coca-Cola commercial, there it is.  And people aren't going to the movies as much.  Well, I don't even, when it says start time 4.10 or whatever, I don't show up until at least 4.10, 4.15 and then buy my ticket.  Yeah, you don't have to.  But then you get a shitty seat.  Well, but some of these theaters are starting to print the time the actual movie starts. 
[01:34:30]  So you can blow off all the nonsense in the beginning.  How about they just blow off all the nonsense?  Well, they're not going to blow off the nonsense.  I'll tell you what's going to be the next step.  Oh, why?  Because they need the money?  Because $10 for a ticket isn't enough?  I'll tell you what the next step is, Anthony.  Hire.  There will be a commercial in the middle of a movie.  Oh, I guarantee it.  No way.  No way.  That's crazy talk.  Now you're talking insane.  I guarantee it.  Could you imagine that?  You're watching a movie, all of a sudden it just fades out and a commercial starts. 
[01:35:00]  I'd lose my fucking mind.  How soon would they go interview Woody Allen?  This is my second Woody Allen fucking reference to this day.  Yes, it is.  He's always bitching when they colorize film.  Yeah.  Forget about it, man.  He'd be fucking all over the...  Just cutting...  It fades out at a dramatic moment and a commercial pops in in the theater.  There'd be a riot.  Let's say hi to Sue in Jersey.  Sue, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Sue.  Hi.  Listen, Opie, I'm surprised you didn't see this thing last week. 
[01:35:30]  It was in Us Weekly.  Us Weekly had one, too?  Yeah, the WB one with the scary car.  I swear, I just got turned on to this only a couple days ago.  I had no idea.  And this thing is going to be in every magazine, and they're going to have a bunch of them.  Oh, it's totally obnoxious.  But you know where it came from?  Do you remember a greeting card used to sing Happy Birthday to you?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I remember those, but you know, it's a greeting card.  That flopped.  You could choose it.  Here it is.  Well, the weird thing is I wasn't prepared for that, so it kind of made me jump a little 
[01:36:00]  bit.  Like, what the fuck is this?  I was driving my car.  I just picked up the mail and opened the thing, and it started playing.  Really?  And I almost had an accident.  It's actually a great idea.  It really is a good idea.  There's not a lot of great ideas out there these days, but that one's a huge one.  Anyway, thank you so much.  You guys suck.  You know what else is really bad?  When you buy a DVD, you buy it.  It's yours to possess.  And they put previews to other movies on the DVD, and you try to hit the menu button just 
[01:36:30]  to skip it, and it gives you that round circle slash.  Yeah.  Like, you're not allowed.  No.  You're watching this.  And I hear they try to guess, like, well, if you were going to watch this movie, maybe  you're into this stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  If he bought this thing, of course he's going to like these previews.  I've had that in some porn, and it's just like, wow, this is the fucking road I'm going  down?  Is this the next step?  That is really funny.  If you're watching this, let me show you your future. 
[01:37:00]  You're going to, like, ass-nafters 10.  This next clip won't be horrifying six weeks from now.  Right.  I wish that was just a joke.  All right.  Well, so that's going on today.  And they're taking over the magazines.  Fox News.  Yeah, we should do this.  Hurricane Ophelia has hit land, I guess, or kind of hit land.  Wow, who's the fatty on TV?  Is this that fat show? 
[01:37:30]  I know.  I look good.  I look good.  There's still got tickets available for this batch, right?  Tickets are still available, and they're $50 at the door.  Come on down.  Wow, that is a fullback.  Is that the Monique show?  No, it's just the news still.  Wow, look at the cottage cheese on that thigh.  Well, I guess it's Fashion Week here in New York City, and of course, I'm sure they're  doing a big girl fashion show.  Look at that doing the I'm going to win a beauty pageant wave.  Well, let me hear her.  She's got to say something stupid.  Well, I don't know.  Draw the line, Jody.  Saretta Barrington from Harlem, New York.  She's an aspiring actress, and she just graduated from Manhattan College, Marymount Manhattan 
[01:38:00]  College.  And we welcome everybody here.  I'm so excited.  I'm so excited.  Full-figure women are really making a landmark in the industry.  You're saying a lot more.  Every time they walk, they mark the land.  So-called real women.  These are full-figured women.  It's a full-figured beauty pageant.  I'm sick of these fucking people who want to be in entertainment.  They don't want to work out.  Go to the gym like the rest of us, you assholes.  You can't do this.  Yeah, you can't do this fat.  You're not going to be a lead. 
[01:38:30]  They're brilliant, though, because they're a bunch of fatties, but they made them sound  like they're hot by calling them full-figured women.  Gilda Jefferson from the Bronx, she's a caterer, can cook, and it can come to New Rochelle.  Life expectancy of 38 years.  Isn't this a variety of lovely full-figured women?  Isn't this a variety of lovely full-figured women?  If you have grandmother arms in your 20s, you should not be on television.  Only chubby chasers, only fatty chasers are attracted to these women. 
[01:39:00]  They make it sound like they're walking down the street, and if they're dressed nicely,  and they look like any guy is going to look and go, mm-hmm, that's hot.  No!  Only guys that enjoy freakishly fat women are going to be attracted to these women.  That's it.  Only guys want to fuck your obliques.  Tight.  Nice.  That's what's into that.  Let's get into Hurricane Ophelia.  It's reeking something off the coast of North Carolina this morning. 
[01:39:30]  Reeking something.  Well, after Hurricane Katrina, I mean...  Who really cares, right?  Katrina redefined havoc.  But Hurricane Katrina got everyone's attention, so of course these news channels, any hurricane  now is going to get a lot of exposure.  Yeah, they send their reporters, and they've been standing in the wind.  I think they're one of the main reasons why we weren't prepared for Katrina.  The reporters?  Yeah, the last five years, weather became like ratings, so anytime it's going to be like six  inches of snow, they make it seem like the apocalypse. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, trying to prepare the people.  They just rise up.  Some people are like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, how many times have they said, the eye of the storm is coming right at us?  No, it isn't.  And then, oh, it made a last-minute turn.  It's always a last-minute thing that happens.  It makes this last-minute turn.  It is barreling directly toward this city.  It's right at the last minute.  I don't know what happened there, but it made a little turn, and thank goodness for that,  because these people are...  This one was a tricky one.  We all got fooled on this.  Yeah, yeah, that's another thing they do.  I was watching the radar the whole time, and last minute, pfft, what are I doing? 
[01:40:30]  You've got like six weeks worth of beef jerky in your freezer.  Now, what am I going to do?  Well, they send their reporters down there to stand in the wind and make it sound horrific,  but after Katrina, eh, we've got some of that audio.  Listen to this lady in the middle of the wind.  Patty Ann, thank you.  Watching these live pictures now off the coast of Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina,  the conditions there are deteriorating today.  I love saying that.  And especially so over the past three hours. 
[01:41:00]  Jamie Colby is on the scene there for us.  She filed this report a few moments ago about conditions that she is hearing  and seeing and feeling there in Wrightsville.  I'm honestly not sure how much longer we're going to be able to come down here.  Yeah, sure.  She's not sure how long she could last there.  Okay, right.  She sounds...  It sounded really dramatic.  I can't believe you cut it off.  I know.  All right, hold on.  It's riveting.  I'll go back slightly right now. 
[01:41:30]  She sounds in trouble.  She sounds in trouble.  I don't know how much longer we're going to be able to come down here this close to the shore  as Hurricane Ophelia makes her way to the Carolina coast.  And it is stretching along the entire coast of North and South Carolina.  Everybody being warned to stay inside and stay off the roads.  We've already had 10 inches of rain.  We may get a foot or more.  Just today, as Ophelia makes her way,  she's expected to cause effects here of heavy rain and flooding for some 24 hours. 
[01:42:00]  Forgive the glasses, guys,  but I've got to tell you,  it's bad enough to eat sand.  It really hurts when it hits your eyes.  And it's also...  Oh, boy, is she informing everybody.  Yeah, I didn't realize that.  Forgive the glasses, guys.  I was going to go downstairs,  try to find some sand,  and throw it into my eyeballs.  But after hearing that report,  I'm going to think about that for a while.  I thought it only hurt when it hit your skin.  Right.  But your eyeballs were immune to that.  So I've had shit bounce off my eyes my whole life. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  I guess when it's really small like that,  granular could hurt more.  That's when it gets in there.  Yeah.  Guys, but I've got to tell you,  it's bad enough to eat sand.  It really hurts when it hits your eyes.  And it's also hitting me and blowing me all over the place.  As the wind's picked up,  we have felt 70 mile per hour winds.  We're expecting to get as much as 80 in the next hour  as the eye of Hurricane Ophelia makes her way.  No telling exactly where it'll make landfall,  but here in Wrightsville Beach,  we're definitely going to feel the strongest impact, 
[01:43:00]  the strongest that we've certainly felt today.  And throughout the day,  these heavy winds, heavy rains,  we've had even hail.  As the winds continue to pick up,  there's been flying debris,  some bridge closings,  and lots of electricity out,  including in our hotel,  that temporarily restored,  which is a good thing  because getting stuck in the elevator once a day  is more than enough.  Yeah, the blackout for a couple of minutes.  Back to you guys. 
[01:43:30]  I think she's going to get an award.  Yeah.  I'm getting this story.  This is me.  I'm getting this award.  The power went out in our hotel temporarily.  Good thing.  Yeah, wow.  She got caught in an elevator.  That's just like being caught in an attic.  Wow, that's bodies.  Wondering if the water's ever going to, you know,  stop rising.  Right.  Same thing.  Bodies floating down the street and looting.  Yeah, sure.  Same thing.  And you hear all the exaggerating.  It's like six inches could get up to another foot.  Right.  That's a big gray area. 
[01:44:00]  Just today, it could.  It could.  Probably won't.  But it could.  Buildings could tip over.  Chuck from Ohio makes a good point.  Chuck?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  This is Chuck from Ohio here.  Yep.  They named these hurricanes in alphabetical order, don't they?  Oh, yeah.  The last one was Katrina.  Now we're on Ophelia.  What the hell happened to L, M, and N?  Yeah, what happened to L, M, and N?  Did they not rate up there?  They didn't rate. 
[01:44:30]  They just weren't.  Well, how about that?  They were just hurricanes in the middle of the ocean that did nothing.  There was Hurricane Nate was N, right?  Yeah.  Nate.  I thought they were on Ophelia's.  I called it Hurricane Fan, though.  That's what I called it.  What was the other one?  What was L?  I don't even know.  We could go to the official hurricane website.  Not that important.  Mike in New York, what's up?  Mike A.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  It's amazing.  They can't make a hurricane sound bad enough to scare people these days, because every marginal 
[01:45:00]  storm merits this kind of news coverage, you know?  Exactly.  To scare people out of New Orleans for Katrina, they'd have to have been like, you know, holy  shit!  You know what I mean?  What are they going to have to do these days to get people to evacuate their homes?  Who was saying this?  Was it Bill?  What was that?  Before the show about Ophelia is kind of like the opening band or the band?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like the opening band going on after the Stones or something like that? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  After the headliner.  The headline's already gone up and killed.  That was Katrina.  Yeah.  Now, you know what?  We got one more storm for you.  Come on, you guys.  Right.  Come on.  Stick around.  We got to keep it going.  Stick around, yeah.  Next storm comes through.  Yeah.  Interesting.  You're trying to sell, yeah.  You're trying to sell another band on the stage after the Rolling Stones.  Come on, guys.  Give her a chance.  Come on.  Give Great White a chance.  Come on.  All right, boys.  All right.  Very nice.  Seth, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[01:46:00]  Love you guys.  You're awesome.  Hey, you guys are mistaken.  It's not Hurricane Katrina.  It's Hurricane Karina.  Did you hear the president's wife?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Oh, yeah.  That's where I go for all my news.  Well, Bill was too busy being a huge star in L.A.  He missed the show yesterday, so we're going to have to play that clip for him.  We have, yeah, Laura Bush mispronouncing Hurricane Katrina.  We're trying to find that clip.  Before that, we have another very short clip on Hurricane Ophelia. 
[01:46:30]  How do you fuck that up?  I don't know.  I can say not knowing, like, the latest, you know, hit band or whatever in your 50s, but  I mean.  That was on the news every minute of the day for days and days and days.  That stuff used to just piss me off when I would see it happen, and now I just laugh.  The worst hurricane to hit the country.  It was all over the place, and she couldn't figure it out.  You know what's funny?  I saw a picture of, you know, Bush getting debriefed and all that. 
[01:47:00]  You know, Kanye was like, George Bush doesn't care about black people.  Yeah.  I saw the vice president of the Dick Cheney.  He doesn't look like he gives a shit about anything.  Any people.  Yeah.  He's just sitting there like, oh, God, you know.  He's like the grumpy old bastard just wants out of office.  Just leave me alone.  No, I think he's the evil genius.  You think he enjoys his job?  Yeah.  He just, that guy is frightening.  He just looks miserable all the time.  He's doing someone a favor by sitting in that seat.  He's getting something for that in the end. 
[01:47:30]  Well, here's the president's wife.  Listen to this, Bill.  Because of Hurricane Karina, are starting to school this week.  And I also want to encourage anybody who is affected by Hurricane Karina to make sure their children.  That would be nobody.  Nobody was affected by Hurricane Karina.  She said it twice.  Maybe it's a, this is bad.  One of the victims' names.  That sounds like a black girl's name.  Karina.  Sorry. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Hurricane Karina.  And then we got Drew from North Carolina sent this in about Hurricane Ophelia.  I guess the local news down there.  Hurricane Ophelia arrives in North Carolina acting more like a slowy cane because she's going to be around a while.  A slowy cane?  He did not say a slowy cane.  What the fuck does that mean?  He even knew that joke sucked.  If you listen to him, he's trying to blow through it. 
[01:48:30]  Like, I don't think this is funny.  Just say it.  It's going to work.  He's just trying to run for the next thing.  A slowy cane?  All right.  Knock it off.  They should have had a guy with that trumpet right out there in the range and blowing that in his ear.  I've got to hear that again.  Hurricane Ophelia arrives in North Carolina acting more like a slowy cane because she's going to be around a while.  Hey, now. 
[01:49:00]  Hey.  Get this, people.  Slowy cane.  Oh, you need that banjo strumming.  Yeah.  It doesn't even make sense as far as a play on words.  Well, no, it just hit me.  Hurry.  Hurricane.  Hurry.  Hurry.  Hurry.  Oh, slowy.  All right, all right.  Hurry.  I just got it when he said it.  For some reason, it clicked.  When I heard it earlier, I was like, that doesn't even make sense.  You know what would be better if it really didn't just completely made no sense that you just fucking scream it? 
[01:49:30]  It was just such energy that people buy it.  Hurry, cane.  More like a meatloaf cane.  He's got this fucking wacky vibe.  People said, these kids today, they're crazy.  I don't even know what they're talking about.  You're a meatloaf cane.  That's great.  I don't know what he meant.  All right, well, it's a slowy cane.  That guy sounded like he was having more fun than I've had in weeks. 
[01:50:00]  The energy he put into that, he was waiting hours to say that.  Sport code just blowing in the wind.  Look at that guy.  Great line.  It's his big day.  It's his big day.  Hurricane Ophelia arrives in North Carolina acting more like a slowy cane because she's going to be around a while.  Do you think he went more like and kind of looked at the camera?  I think he leaned forward.  Put on your funny hats, people, because here it comes. 
[01:50:30]  Here comes the funny.  You ever see Andy Kindler do that, like mocking bad comedy?  He, like, leans forward when he does the punchline.  A slowy cane.  A slowy cane.  Jesus, what is the fucking benchmark for comedy in the weather room?  I don't know.  Oh, we found the Celine Dion clip for Bill Burr.  This is one of the funniest things we've heard in a while.  Yeah, if you missed this the other day, it's Celine losing her mind on Larry King. 
[01:51:00]  Here's another person, you know, she don't speak you too good, Ingley.  She's on her high horse, a lot of money.  I don't think she really knows a lot about reality.  This is Celine?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And she's commenting on the hurricane and the poor people.  Yeah, listen to that.  As Larry King just sits there and says nothing.  Yeah, listen to what she had to say.  You know, some people are stealing and they're making a big deal out of it.  Oh, they're stealing 20 pairs of jeans or they're stealing television sets. 
[01:51:30]  Who cares?  They're not going to go too far with it.  Maybe those people are so poor, some of the people who do that, they're so poor,  they've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  Exactly.  The one says it all from Bill Burr.  What is she?  She's trying to, like, book a dramatic role or something?  She's, like, trying to cry?  She's trying to win an Emmy on a talk show.  She wants poor people to touch things that they'll never touch in their lives.  That they'll never touch.  See, before the hurricane, they could have walked into Best Buy and touched a television. 
[01:52:00]  I think you can touch it.  Right.  You can touch it.  You can't buy it.  Touch it.  Just to touch these things, Larry.  And, uh, no.  They're not touching.  I think there's so many celebrities, like, down there, like, touching those people and doing all that type of shit.  At this point, you need to cry.  Yeah.  To get any sort of FaceTime.  To make it seem like you really care and to get, yeah, your face put on the news.  You've got to break into tears.  Yeah, you were, who were you, uh, talking about before the show? 
[01:52:30]  Oh, Sean Penn.  Oh, the Sean Penn in the news.  Oh, no, John Travolta.  John Travolta, right.  Just standing there with his hand on somebody's shoulder as they're telling, like, the, you know, the horror that they've been through.  And, meanwhile, there's, like, 50 paparazzi, like, taking his picture.  Yeah.  And they're, like, over here, John.  Two more over here.  Yeah.  Because you look concerned in this direction.  Okay, that's a wrap.  People were out, and the guy's, like, right in the middle of his story.  And then, then my grandmother was sliding down the stairs.  All right, we've got to wrap this, people.  Look, I got a goal. 
[01:53:00]  Ditchism.  Bush did the same thing when he toured the area.  All they had was pictures of him hugging and kissing black women.  Oh, and then he's dressed like he's actually going to start cleaning up.  Yeah, yeah, he's doing a coveralls or something.  Let me help out over here.  I think we can all pitch in.  He's got clothes for every occasion.  You're so right.  Yeah, show up with the wardrobe van.  Yeah.  Those big rubber boots.  I need some cleanup clothes.  Sleeves are rolled up.  Yeah.  He's completely dry with a full stomach.  Just in case.  Loading up some lumber in the back of the limo, the presidential limo in the trunk. 
[01:53:30]  Pop the trunk.  I think we need to clear some of this stuff out.  That's like when they're on the ranch, everyone has to dress like they're on Bonanza.  Everyone's got, like, cowboy vests on and shit.  You know, they're standing like, this is so fucking gay.  It really is time to get rid of the cowboy hat.  It's not doing anyone any good.  Like going out there chopping wood.  Just filling the land.  Here's this guy again.  He bitched at us about the Laura Bush thing when we played it the other day. 
[01:54:00]  Sean from Old Bridge.  It's great for you guys to make fun of Laura Bush because you've both got perfect diction  and have never had problems pronouncing words.  Good thing the hurricane wasn't put or hurricane finger.  It's not a mispronunciation of the word because...  It's a wrong name.  Yeah, because you mispronounced the word.  It's a whole different name.  She has no clue what the name of the most devastating hurricane to hit the country was, you idiot.  Fucking moron.  It's not a lisp or a stutter.  Right.  It's not a word you've been mispronouncing for years of your life and other people didn't tell you. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, it's a whole different name.  Yeah.  It's a name.  She...  She even stumbles.  It's not important enough for her to remember the hurricane's name.  She even stumbles because she's like, oh my God, I don't know the name of the hurricane.  Yeah.  You think she can't say Katrina?  Sean M. from Old Bridge, New Jersey.  Yeah.  Why I oughta...  I'll just see that Bush thing again.  Well, listen again and make sure we're accurate about this.  You know something?  Is she mispronouncing Katrina or is she saying a whole different name? 
[01:55:00]  I'm banning Sean.  Don't ban him.  I'm banning him from instant feedback.  One click.  No, don't ban him, Anthony.  What?  No, no, don't.  Don't.  He's just a stupid listener.  Don't do it to him.  All right.  He gets one more chance.  That's all he's got.  One more chance.  That's all he's got.  Just let him be.  All right.  All right, listen.  We'll listen again and see if he's right or if we're right.  Is she just mispronouncing Katrina or is it a whole different name?  You be the judge.  Because of Hurricane Karina are starting to school this week. 
[01:55:30]  And I also want to encourage anybody who is affected by Hurricane Karina to make sure their children...  Yeah, see that stutter is her trying to remember the name of the fucking hurricane.  Exactly.  What's the name of that devastating killer hurricane?  Yeah, what was the name of that?  Karina, something like that.  Jackass.  Got to play this clip for Bill, too, before we move on.  Celine Dion on Larry King.  It is...  You know, when I was hearing a couple of days ago that these things are not reachable, it's too full of water. 
[01:56:00]  Maybe I'm too much like a man.  I'm not thinking with my head.  I'm talking with my heart.  Nobody can open any roofs.  The helicopter's flying in.  Take two people at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  What?  There's kids being raped at night.  We hear gunshots.  Big guns.  What's that?  Those people are praying.  They're walking.  They're like this.  Hello?  Do you see us?  We're still alive.  But we're dying. 
[01:56:30]  It's terrible.  I do not want to talk to you about money.  I hate when these celebrities have to turn into experts about stuff they don't know anything about.  Take a kayak and ram into the wall?  Take a kayak through those walls.  Through those walls.  Take a kayak.  Put on some swimmies.  And just punch the walls in.  Put some flippers and swim up the stairs.  Get a snorkel.  And just do something. 
[01:57:00]  Karate chop the wall.  There are people raped at the big guns.  People are yelling.  What is that?  What is that?  They're saying I'm alive.  Sounds like someone having a nervous breakdown while doing like bad stand-up.  What is the deal with that?  Is any of this funny?  Why do they give you the peanuts on the airplane?  What's with those peanuts?  How do you open it back? 
[01:57:30]  You need to ram your finger in it?  Why could the professor make radio out of coconut but can't fix hole in both?  Those people were starving on island.  Poor Gilligan would screw up rescue.  Just get a kayak.  Have the skipper punch through the wall.  Why don't they use the headhunters' boats?  They seem to be able to get from island to island.  What is going on? 
[01:58:00]  Just ram the island with the headhunters' boats.  And push it back to shore.  Come on.  Why would the Howells have so much money on a three-hour tour?  That money could be given to these starving people.  Why?  Why did I marry someone 42 years older than me with a shriveled-up old gun that I had to suck like I enjoy it?  He rags it in my face.  Why?  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:58:30]  They're all survivors.  She's useless.  You think she was punching her chest?  Yeah, when she'd sing.  She would probably do that chest punch thing all passionate.  Oh, man.  Hold on, Jack.  All right.  One more clip from Celine.  We couldn't get enough of this the other day, and Bill hasn't heard this, so I love it.  We've got to play one more clip. 
[01:59:00]  We've been doing the show now for two and a half hours.  We've been asking a lot of people how they can help, how you can help.  A lot of people all over the world want to help.  You gave a million dollars.  You're going to help a lot of people live and survive.  You should take great pride in that.  One, that you've attained the ability to be able to do that, to be able to give a million dollars.  You take pride in that.  I understand it.  I understand it's very important because eventually we will need that money.  But it's just very frustrating that Franco and Constance West and me, oh, they're one million dollar. 
[01:59:30]  If this is one thing, in three months and six months, they will need that money.  Right now, they're praying for water.  So we need to send them the water.  They don't care about my check.  This should be her show in Vegas.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's just frustrating because on our part of the world, we're trying to our death, and we're expecting those people.  Ooh.  Your check was turning into something.  Larry's like, God damn.  Why do I have to deal with this? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, she's just fucking grandstanding.  Your check will turn into something.  What did you think of Sean Penn going down there with his boat?  I mean, if you've got a boat, go down there and rescue people.  I thought that was cool, but I just think it's weird.  All the boats that are down there, somehow there's paparazzi all around your boat.  No, he brought his own photographer.  That came out.  Oh, he did.  Yeah, that came out.  He brought his own photographer down there.  Oh, that's shameless.  And then his boat, he forgot to put the plug in it or whatever, so he had to try to get the water out of it. 
[02:00:30]  He had to picture him bailing out his boat with a little red beer cup.  Yeah, so he's frantically, yeah, exactly, left over from Mardi Gras.  Yeah, that's what it looked like.  You know what I love, though?  He's such like the Meisner actor that he actually took the time to grow the white trash mustache.  Right, right.  Because he totally looks the part.  He had like a shotgun walking up the street.  Shotgun.  He's wearing like a vest.  Very dramatic.  Going to clean up this town.  Well, he was doing his part.  Marshall.  I mean, yeah, he did save some people.  But aren't you supposed to, uh, the heathens pray in public? 
[02:01:00]  You know how it goes in the good book?  In the good book.  In the good book.  What a tool.  Well, we're all talking about hurricanes later than that.  Oh, break down the walls.  We've got to get Martini Steve back in here.  Because he interviewed our own Master Poe.  Oh, right.  This is hurricane related, isn't it?  Uh, yes.  Yes.  I guess Master Poe was watching some of the coverage and saw that this evacuation was a disaster.  And a lot of people died.  And being in charge of people's lives here at the studio, our lives are in Poe's hands at some points. 
[02:01:30]  You know, do you know that?  Yeah, I do.  And if, uh, God forbid a disaster like, uh, Karina, uh, swept across, uh, Manhattan, what would we do?  What would we do?  So, he's not the brightest guy, I've got to tell you.  Jeez, Opie.  He just isn't.  The other day, after the show, we had, I had a meet with Barry Shapiro.  My Jewish, basically, business accountant guy.  I don't even know what he does for us.  He's, uh, our finance guy. 
[02:02:00]  Our finance guy.  He figures out a way to funnel our money.  Typical Jew, no hair.  Jesus, Opie!  Typical Jewish guy, no hair.  Gee.  A punch.  Like, this guy wouldn't, couldn't hurt anyone.  So, sucked in gym class.  Ah, he was the last guy chosen when he was picking sides.  Accountant.  Yeah.  Dude, uh, next time I have a meeting with him, I'm going to record it because I swear  to you, it's another language that we don't know about yet. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  He talks about stuff, I'm like, this is going on somewhere out there?  There's all kinds of financial things that he tells us about.  He knows the latest laws and rules and, and it's unbelievable.  So, he bored me to death for at least 45 minutes.  It is boring as hell, I'll give you that.  I dread his meeting.  And I'm leaving with Barry and, as a joke, I walk by Master Poe and I go, watch out for  this guy.  He throws a mean punch.  Obviously, this guy doesn't even have a hint of muscle on him, okay? 
[02:03:00]  He's, he's like a veal.  Can't lift his arm above his shoulder.  He's a veal with a calculator.  He stinks.  So, the next day, I skate up to Master Poe, who, you know, makes sure we're safe and,  uh, Master Poe goes to me, hey, uh, that guy yesterday, uh, he throws a mean punch,  huh?  Like, Master Poe, it's, what, I, I couldn't believe you were buying that I was, I was  serious. 
[02:03:30]  Here he comes.  I go, who, and he goes, the guy you were walking out with yesterday after the show.  I'm like, Master Poe, it's Barry Shapiro.  He, he, he doesn't know how to punch or do anything.  How are you, how do you buy, how did you buy that?  Well, I don't know his background.  When you told me he throws a mean punch, you really can't underestimate anyone.  Uh, he can.  Anyone?  That's right.  Even Barry Shapiro?  Barry Shapiro. 
[02:04:00]  He could be 90 pounds and knock someone out.  Wow.  There was a skinny guy that fought, I, I don't remember his name, but he fought Muhammad Ali  and he knocked, uh, Muhammad Ali down.  But he was in the fight game to begin with.  Well, yeah.  Bow to your sensei.  Bow to your sensei!  Barry Shapiro ain't hurting anyone.  No, it's the, it's the martial art, uh, mindset.  Right.  I understand, anybody, anybody can be a threat.  Look.  Anyone's a threat and he assesses everybody.  But see, if you have that attitude, you'll never get to sleep at night.  This guy obviously is not going to be a problem. 
[02:04:30]  Who says Poe sleeps at night?  See him just sitting there.  I'm going to figure out what the threat level is at any given moment.  If some people you could just look at and realize there's going to be no problem there.  Well, sure.  Let's be honest.  I mean, Barry Shapiro is not.  How old is the guy?  50-something.  Dude, the guy hasn't done a, I don't think he's ever done a sit-up.  I don't think.  He's going to be, there was a 50-year-old accountant.  Yeah.  Who knocked out Joe Frazier.  You don't want to, you don't want to, you don't want to underestimate a 50-year-old, 
[02:05:00]  out-of-shape Jewish accountant.  Yeah, I'm with you, Bo.  He's done classic sports.  He should have trained for 10 years before that, who knows, or when he was a kid.  You know what it would be like, it would be like saying that, remember the time to make  the donuts guy from Dunkin' Donuts?  That's pretty much what this guy's threat level is, if you just look at him.  He kind of, it's like that.  You wouldn't think the time to make the donuts guy would be any type of threat.  Okay, well, Bernie gets, he's skinny.  As a matter of fact, he's probably skinnier than this guy.  Well, someone skinny is a different story, maybe. 
[02:05:30]  He's a quick figure.  But this guy isn't skinny.  Yeah, that was all about, yeah.  Yeah.  He had a gun.  Right.  True.  I was talking about Barry physically hurting somebody with a punch.  I said he packs a mean punch.  Right.  Poe just sees it as, all right, I'm going to take the world differently.  Every martial artist out there will not underestimate their opponent.  There you go.  Free the cricket from whackbag.com.  Poe equals literal idiot.  Jesus.  Very brave through the internet. 
[02:06:00]  So Martini Steve is in the studio.  Yeah.  And you interviewed Master Poe?  Well, yeah.  We were talking about the potential for a hurricane to actually hit Manhattan.  And I wanted to know what the evacuation plan would be if, God forbid, a hurricane hit while we were all in the building.  Uh-huh.  So we're up here quite a few feet off street level. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  Also, by the way, we are on the highest point in Manhattan.  This is, you know, right where we are.  Right.  It's downhill anywhere you go.  It's like east side, west side, you're going downhill.  Right.  Uh, I don't think we'd get the type of flooding here that we saw in New Orleans, which is below sea level.  Well, you have to be prepared.  And I just really wanted to hear what the plan might be.  Why is Master Poe giving you a look right now? 
[02:07:00]  I don't know.  What's wrong, Master Poe?  Well, because we were having a discussion and he was just asking me his advice because he said his wife was nervous.  Didn't know that he was being recorded.  Or you were recording me.  I certainly was.  Oh, yeah.  This was, yeah, Master Poe had no idea we were going to.  This is a scandal.  He didn't have an idea that we were taping this for the radio.  Take a look at what I'm wearing, people.  You think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys? 
[02:07:30]  Who was it, Linda Tripp?  So, it's not exactly the most, the most, the easiest interview to conduct considering the fact that, you know,  I know full well that this place is well above sea level and I'm not an idiot.  We're five floors up.  Yeah.  Well, Master Poe takes everything seriously.  Right.  And you said that you wanted to leave.  You're talking evacuation.  Now, how would we evacuate?  I think the safest place would be just to stay put here.  Right.  We'd probably stay on the air and just have a little fun.  That's right.  If there was a hurricane, we couldn't leave.  I think...  Well, what happens if the power goes out? 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Now the power goes out.  Right.  Auxiliary power kicks on.  We're back on the air.  Do we have a good time?  Of course we do.  Everyone does in New York.  Have you ever been in a completely blackout building?  I certainly have.  I was stuck at...  You were stuck where?  At NEW.  The last blackout.  And there's no auxiliary power there.  So, that sucks.  Were you always stuck in the elevator?  No.  Fortunately.  Stuck in the staircase?  So you could just walk down.  And we did.  We did.  But, you know, but it's...  But you're walking down...  How many flights down was that?  Nine?  I don't know.  You have to follow Earl's eyes and...  Hold nine stories to get to freedom. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, no.  I'm not, you know.  But he asked.  But there's no generators.  Light the way.  All right.  Well, so, Steve interviewed Master Poe and we got some audio.  Master Poe had no idea we were interviewing him.  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation plan.  I'm sorry?  What?  No.  I mean, there's apparently a...  I guess there's actually...  Steve, you're the biggest pussy.  What?  I can hear that you're nervous.  No, I'm trying not to crack up.  Are you sure?  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  I don't...  I'm not afraid of what Poe's going to do if he happens to get angry and, you know, knock  my head off.  You kind of have a nervousness to your voice, like, oh, God, I hope I don't piss him off.  No, no, no.  It's, oh, God, I hope I don't crack up.  All right, all right.  There's apparently a...  I guess there's...  Because he's, like, slamming things around, like...  No, I...  I hope this goes okay.  He can never infiltrate the mob.  Right.  They find the wire in, like, two seconds.  Yeah, exactly.  He's a little nervous.  From his voice, you can tell something's up already. 
[02:09:30]  I am...  I am trying to...  Desperately...  The sweat pouring off the floor.  Desperately trying to maintain my composure while asking questions without bursting into  fucking laughter.  You're right, Steve.  No, I'm not wearing a wire.  He just loses it immediately.  I'm just a little wired.  I mean...  Listen how natural Steve comes across.  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation slam.  I'm sorry?  What? 
[02:10:00]  No, I mean...  It sounds like...  What?  No.  Uh-huh.  It sounds like it's written like bad acting.  Like, they're reading...  Apparently I'm supposed to...  Uh-huh.  I am sorry?  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation slam.  I'm sorry?  What?  No, I mean...  There's apparently a...  Uh-uh.  I guess...  I guess there's actually now concern of this hurricane.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, fuck.  You're kidding me.  What are they saying? 
[02:10:30]  If...  What is it hitting?  If in the event that it hits this area, what is the...  I guess...  I guess what would your recommendation...  Holy shit!  Oh, Dave!  That is not a guy that thinks he's going to crack...  This is...  I guess...  That's not a guy that's going to crack up at any moment.  I'm trying to think how to phrase it.  Yeah, I'm really just trying to think how to phrase it, because I walked into this cold.  I'm not buying it.  What, you think I'm afraid?  You honestly think I'm frightened?  I think you're frightened. 
[02:11:00]  I'm sorry.  Bill, frightened or is...  I don't know.  It sounds like bad soap opera acting.  I think he...  Yeah, that's what I think it is.  It's just bad acting.  Yeah, horrible acting.  And the fact that maybe he's a little shook up that this is being recorded.  Right.  Yeah.  And he knows that his side is going to be on this also.  Yeah.  So he's got to perform...  I would agree with Anthony on that one.  I would totally fess up to bad acting and totally fess up to knowing it was being recorded.  Well, Poe, you've come back.  Rachel.  A string of peloponies. 
[02:11:30]  That's awful acting.  That's really bad.  I guess, what would your recommendation be for an evacuation plan to get everybody out of here?  Okay.  First, we have to find out when is it going to hit.  I would assume...  And six hours before it hits?  Oh.  We're out of here. 
[02:12:00]  Okay.  Not one hour before it hits.  Six hours before it hits.  Now, okay.  Why six hours?  What would that time frame allow?  Well, I was involved with Hurricane Floyd.  And I stayed...  You kicked his ass, right?  Yeah.  We stayed...  A talk kick right to the eye.  Yeah.  Take care of that problem.  No, we stayed in the house and we tried to fight this hurricane and that was stupid.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, the best thing for you to do is to get rid of your... 
[02:12:30]  Or take your clothing, your electronics.  Well, we'll listen to the tape.  I just want to know why the six hours.  That's all.  Because six hours...  Don't give you time.  That also sounds kind of dangerous.  Like, then you're out of the building on a crowded evacuating road as the storm hits.  All right.  Let's listen.  I don't know.  Let's listen.  Who am I to say while he's sitting next to me?  Because if anybody has ever experienced being in a hurricane...  Right.  It's one of the worst things ever.  Now, you guys were up on top of this building and, you know, if we stay here, most likely nothing's going to happen. 
[02:13:00]  However, depending on where we live, we may have to do some preparations in our homes.  Okay.  Make some preparations.  I know I will definitely have to make some preparations.  All right.  So far, so good.  Fairly normal.  We'll move on here.  If by chance that we are hit by a hurricane, let's say now.  Yeah.  And the best thing for us to do is to stay here. 
[02:13:30]  Stay here?  Well, it's too late.  The hurricane hit us.  If it's that bad...  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Because you know what's going to happen is you're getting...  Okay, you won't be able to get a taxi.  You won't be able to get a train.  And it will be difficult for you to get out of New York City.  Anthony will not...  It's going to take him four and a half hours to get home.  So that's why we have to stay watch of this hurricane.  If by chance the hurricane is going to hit us, then we have to be ahead of it.  If the hurricane is going to hit us at 2 o'clock, then we have to get out of here three, four hours preferably ahead of time. 
[02:14:00]  How much time for a slowy cane, though?  Because I would assume you've got more time.  No, that was wrong.  That was wrong.  If the hurricane is going to hit, just stay home.  Stay home.  Stay home.  We'd have enough advance notice.  So have you done any research on this shit, or he just came in and asked the question, and you just went with it?  No, I was hit by a hurricane.  I was hit by a hurricane very bad. 
[02:14:30]  I lost my home in 99.  We've got a comedian coming up this weekend.  This is my whole life.  And now the funny.  But when Steve asked you, it's pretty much cold.  You didn't know that you were going into this meeting to discuss evacuation.  He said his wife was concerned.  Yeah.  All right, let's continue listening here.  Hurricane liver cirrhosis, maybe, she'd be concerned with.  Like, you know, say it's 7 o'clock in the morning, and we get, you know, a heads up. 
[02:15:00]  Guys, get out of Dodge.  Go now.  What do we do?  How do we get open at home?  How do we get...  What we should have outside, okay, Anthony is going to be driving home himself.  I would assume.  I don't know.  Opie is probably going to need to be driven home.  He's not going to take a taxi or...  Rollerblades.  I mean, if the hurricane is that bad, then we would take him home.  Well, look at that.  You got taken home.  Just let the hurricane blow me home. 
[02:15:30]  Exactly.  I don't have to use my legs when I'm rollerblading.  You could put on your blades, and the breeze would whisk you home.  It would whisk me home.  Really nice and fast.  I guess the question is, let's, God forbid, if we're all stuck here for...  Okay.  Let's say we're all stuck in this...  What we should do is have provisions.  We should have our flashlights.  We should have our food.  We should definitely have our water.  Mm-hmm.  And we should have extra amount of that. 
[02:16:00]  Now, honestly, if the hurricane is that bad, we can see it on television.  We can say, okay, well, guess what, guys?  We shouldn't be here.  It's going to hit New York City this date.  Mm-hmm.  Do not be here, because this is going to be a deadlock.  Mm-hmm.  You won't be able to get in and out of the city.  9-11, same thing.  You couldn't get in and out of the city.  Right, right, right.  And the problem is that, okay, you have a hurricane, so now you have wind. 
[02:16:30]  Is it a tropical storm, the water's coming down so hard, you're driving, and then you're  stopped because the rain is coming down so hard, people can't even see in front of  them.  That's how bad it gets.  Painting quite the picture.  Someone had to really get in some feedback about, basically, something about Steve asking  Master Bonin to talk louder into his lapel.  I don't know the exact word. 
[02:17:00]  Just the worst fucking guy.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Excuse me, can you talk louder?  Yeah, postwhores.net, Clark, Master Poe, can you say that a little louder and say that  might love the bell?  That's a great line, bro. 
[02:17:30]  Poe's got a very dramatic delivery, though.  He's very intense.  He painted this horrific picture.  Like that Day After Tomorrow movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's continue.  So you're talking about barricading everybody in this place for a period of maybe several  days.  Oh my God, what kind of hurricane are we talking about?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  If you're talking about a severe, drastic hurricane that's coming in, first of all,  why be here? 
[02:18:00]  Right.  You know why?  Because the only reason why we're here is to do a show.  Well, guess what?  We won't have any electricity.  Oh.  Great answer, Steve.  Great answer.  I can hear myself scrolling through the phone as I'm answering this.  We won't have any electricity.  Oh.  Yeah, you're really good at how you keep leading Poe to other areas where the comedy can keep  coming.  I am terrible.  But you know what?  You have to understand that I'm the only person in the building at that point who's 
[02:18:30]  not going to lose his mind laughing.  The option was me or Ben.  That was the choice.  When you throw those two in the mix, I think I was immediately elected.  All right.  More.  Good point.  Imagine, no electricity, no computer ability, no access at all.  Do you know what's going to happen here?  Chaos.  Either Opie and Andy is going to make us all laugh, and Jimmy, well, Jimmy's not going to  be here, but Opie and Andy is going to make us laugh, or they're going to go crazy, and 
[02:19:00]  they're going to drive us crazy.  Maybe we can count on them to be entertaining, but who knows?  Good one, Steve.  You're welcome.  Did you get that one from Eric Logan?  All right.  A couple more clips here.  We've already talked about how to get open and home, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What about you got interns that are coming from Staten Island, Jersey?  How would they get home?  Talking about four kids who are going to have... 
[02:19:30]  Staten Island will be covered with water, gentlemen.  A tidal wave will wash over them, destroying the island.  I love the drama in Pose of the Boys.  Very, very melodramatic delivery.  Staten Island, write it off, kids.  It's gone.  Four kids who are going to have frightened parents at home.  And I'm assuming we're responsible for them.  Of course.  Okay, so if we're responsible for them, then either A, they stay here with grown-up adults 
[02:20:00]  that can handle the situation, or...  Where?  Where are they?  As opposed to those childlike adults.  They get taken home.  But if we're worried about taking them home, and Anthony's going to be spending six hours  getting home, getting to Long Island.  Well, like I said, if it's going to be that bad, Anthony shouldn't come in.  Right, right.  If it gets that bad, then no one should be coming in.  Right.  We'll give you the day off.  Hey, we got some great instant feedback coming in.  Rich from Allentown.  If the hurricane floods, Anthony is screwed.  He will not have any shoes from his shoelaces being wet. 
[02:20:30]  Chris from Dallas, Texas.  Hmm.  Being trapped in an office with Steve the Bear and no food.  Make sure you keep the cameras rolling, kids.  And Jimmy from WhackBag.com.  Steve would hover above the water in his hybrid.  Certainly would.  All right.  One more clip here.  Steve and Master Poe talking about an evacuation plan.  Or maybe not.  Nope. 
[02:21:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  All right, here we go.  All right, say you've got these kids.  Let's say, let's say, God forbid, this fucking hurricane.  We're all dumb enough to come in.  He's getting tough on them now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where do we take...  Do you have the ability to house any of these kids?  Would you feel comfortable enough taking any of these kids home?  My place is big if, um...  Is it fixed up enough?  Yeah, there's plenty of room.  They'll just sleep with the dogs. 
[02:21:30]  With the dogs?  No, I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ, Poe.  Cool fuck.  Um...  No.  And then...  I mean, shit.  There's plenty of room.  Providing you could get out.  Could you take kids home?  I don't know why you're smiling, because let me tell you, this is a horror for me, man.  I just, I'm tired, I really, I hate having these fucking conversations, because I really  do.  I fucking hate it.  This is what you call a nightmare, right?  And you're smiling, and I don't know why you're smiling.  This is a nightmare. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  You shot in the head in a second.  This destroys houses, this destroys homes, this destroys families.  You know what's making this bit better?  The listeners.  Brian from posthores.net.  Oh, yeah, you guys are just going to be sitting there telling jokes to everyone.  Who are you kidding?  Hope's going to be killing people for sport, and Anthony will be in the corner washing  his hands for hours on edge. 
[02:22:30]  That goes on and on.  And while this is going on, I have Ben and Wicklin in the other office, and Don in the  other room, phoning in questions.  Oh, really?  So I'm picking up the phone thinking it's somebody else, and I'm playing it off, but it's Don  and Ben in the other room, phoning in questions.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Master Poe's evacuation plan, courtesy of Steve.  Wow.  Very good, guys.  Thanks.  At least we're all safe.  And he did know, you know, stay home. 
[02:23:00]  Thank you, guys.  We would stay home.  Where's the hybrid song?  We've got to play that as Steve leads the studio.  No, hold on a minute.  Thanks, Master Poe.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was riveting.  Yeah, wasn't it?  Terrible.  You are really bad, Steve.  I know.  Where's the hybrid song?  Well, again, you know, it's either me or it's Ben.  And you want Ben trying to conduct an interview like that?  No. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  Can't find it?  No.  Oh, this won't bother you too much.  Is this the one?  Oh, okay, good.  Is that it?  All right, Steve.  There goes the...  Whoa!  Bye, Steve!  Bye-bye.  This is from Chemistry as we go to break.  Hybrid song.  I know a big bear.  He talks with good diction. 
[02:24:00]  Hibernates in Toyota with good fuel emissions and great tax deductions.  His habitat's a hybrid.  His paws are on the steering wheel.  He barely fits inside it.  His cave has XM and a keyless entry.  Don't leave a scent in your tent.  His belly is empty.  The only bear.  I know a gastric bypass.  Smarter than the average.  Roll up on the hybrid and steal your picnic basket.  The ranger's lunch always makes his belly grow.  Now last I seen him, he was speeding around.  Jellystone getting 40 miles per gallon.  Rolling through the Rockies.  Doing Ramon promos for two-disc jockeys.  Steeds a piece of garbage. 
[02:24:30]  Forged for nuts and berries.  Top of the food chain, but drives a car for ferries.  Piece of shit.  Stores energy with friction and magnets.  Ramon.  Hybrids are for faggots.  Hybrids are gay.  Steeds are queer.  Plug in your automobile.  You take it in the rear.  You homo.  Yo, his car got a kickstand.  Go and buy a new one.  Spend more than six grand.  Hybrids are gay.  Steeds are queer.  If you plug in your automobile, you take it in the rear.  You homo.  His car got a kickstand.  Go and buy a new one. 
[02:25:00]  Spend more than six grand.  Hybrids are gay.  Hybrids are gay.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Anything else for the Zach Wilde interview we want to play?  Anything else?  How about anything at all?  I'm telling you, I'm a bad interviewer.  Anything with Jimmy on it.  Well, there's so much audio.  I don't know if we can get to all of this, so I'm trying to just get to the... 
[02:25:30]  Talks about going with double duty.  He's very respectful towards the Aussie.  He talks about a prank he pulled in Philly where he wore a dress with his whole...  He brought his whole group of guys into a mall in Philly.  Group of guys?  Yeah, Zach loves homo humor.  Yeah, he does.  He lives for gay humor.  Yeah.  He's a big biker.  They love that shit.  By that, you mean the crew.  Yes.  That he's rolling with.  Yes.  I'm not going to get out of that one.  They were dressed like biz itches.  All right, let's play the audio from the prank here, all right? 
[02:26:00]  You did something in a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP was in love with you.  He was telling me that you did something in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you want to date a dress or did you do something in a public address?  It was completely uncalled for.  Something in a dress.  Anything in a dress.  Anything in a dress.  Anything with a D in it.  Fucking asshole.  Humna, humna, humna, humna.  Just so happy to be communicating.  Myself sick.  I love it.  Humna, humna.  Shuff for the future.  Dude, I knew it, too.  I fucking knew this was going to happen.  No!  It's fine.  I mean, I'm going to...  It's adorable. 
[02:26:30]  It's not adorable.  It's irritating.  It's like a big clock right behind whoever he's interviewing.  In 10 seconds, you will be kicked off this bus.  When did you start?  When did you start?  You had a guitar.  I had a dress.  You wore a dress.  You had bought a dress.  Something with a dress.  It's like I'm a $25,000 pyramid with Zach Wilde.  Something with a dress.  You wore a dress.  You had a dress.  Things guys like a homo do.  Pass.  Pass on.  Pass on.  Pass on.  I got to hear the beginning of this again.  Move on, ma'am.  All right, listen again.  You did something with a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking... 
[02:27:00]  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP, who was in love with you, was telling me that you did something  with a dress.  I don't know what it was.  If you want a dating address, you did something with a dress.  It was really...  I don't even need the answer.  I don't even...  He said dress like 18 times.  Oh, it's so awful.  Something with a dress.  That's bad.  Zach, what's your address?  I need something with a dress.  Oh, God.  And hit the bell every time he says dress, right?  I want to try to hear the rest of you.  You did something with a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, Kim from YSP, who was in love with you, was telling me that you did something  with a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on to a dating address?  Did you do something in public with a dress?  It was really...  He tried to, like, reshape that question every time he started to ask it.  Like, no, that's not the right approach.  Just try this approach.  Just try this approach.  Abort!  Abort!  Go this way.  Go this way.  Somebody else.  Someone else told me about the dress.  No, I knew about the dress.  It was hysterical with the dress. 
[02:28:00]  We wear dresses sometimes, and we...  Are you a fan of the birdcage?  Oh, it's not fantastic.  We're just...  We're smashing your face.  We should have been down there helping out with this whole thing, but...  You could hear his little heart pounding.  Oh, he's freaking out.  He was.  You kept waiting for them to realize, wait a minute.  You're Jimmy Norton.  Shut up.  Go away.  Leave.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Oh, I kept waiting for my professional mask to fall off.  You did something in a dress. 
[02:28:30]  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP, who was in love with you, was telling me that you did something  in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress?  Did you do something in a public with a dress?  It was really completely uncalled for and hilarious.  See?  I like what he goes.  It's uncalled for.  Oh, fuck.  That's been pissed off.  And hilarious.  Uncalled for.  And hilarious.  Don't hit me.  Don't kick me out.  Don't kick me out.  Yeah, this is my moment.  Don't kick me out, please.  Every question I ask has to have a disclaimer.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I love it.  I'm a worm.  I absolutely love it.  It is the cutest interview ever, Jimmy. 
[02:29:00]  It is awful.  Don't you worry about it.  See?  See?  All right.  We're hanging with Bill Burr today.  Don't forget to watch Bill Burr on HBO tomorrow night at midnight.  This half-hour comedy special airs.  And if you've got HBO on demand, like me, you get to watch it whenever the hell you want. 
[02:29:30]  That's right.  Go hang out at a friend's house or kill your best friend who has HBO.  I steal his cable.  Did you hear about this story?  I just did.  Animals.  Anthony has all the details.  I was just going to read the story, but...  Oh, yeah, if you just want the details.  Well, I'll do the first paragraph, and then you can fill in the blanks, okay?  Long Island sex den shocker killed for his house a 20-year-old...  Wow, he was an orphan, too?  Yeah.  A 20-year-old orphan who was living alone in his dead mom's Long Island home was murdered... 
[02:30:00]  Oh!  Murder.  ...by his two best friends because they wanted to use the house as a sex den to sleep with their girlfriends, police said yesterday.  Sex den.  I don't know why they're bringing the sex angle into the story.  It's the press.  They've got to make it sound, you know, even worse than it is.  But it just seems like these guys...  Well, they were friends of this guy.  There's two guys, and they were friends with the third guy, the orphan. 
[02:30:30]  He'd inherited this house from his mom, who had died five years earlier.  And so he's kind of a young guy.  I guess he's 20, 21, and he's got a house.  Wait, Michael Moore's dead?  That's what it says.  Michael Moore's dead?  I think it's a different one.  What are the liberals going to do?  I don't know, but it might be a different one.  Oh, it's a different one.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I don't think Michael Moore's living in Freeport.  Freeport!  Sorry.  And so he's like 21 years old. 
[02:31:00]  He's got his own house, his own car.  From what I read in there, a plasma TV.  So he had a few bucks.  A lot of nice things to touch.  Some nice things.  Just let them touch it.  Let them just touch the kayak!  Shut up.  Slamming into the wall trying to figure out how to go through a wall.  Kayak.  Kayak.  How many times would you have to slam a kayak into a wall before it would jam?  You'd need some sort of motor.  Yeah.  You'd need a motorized kayak, and then at that point I don't think it's a kayak anymore. 
[02:31:30]  Maybe like four Samoans.  Do you back up the kayak like 20 feet and then paddle real fast?  Yeah!  Here it goes!  Dun-kid.  Oh, man!  And then you back up again.  You've got to paddle harder!  Paddle your kayak!  Moron.  Do you jump forward in the kayak just in the last second to give it that last oof?  Does that help at all?  Who knows?  What a dummy.  Sorry, Anthony.  That's alright.  So this guy had a few items, possessions, and a house. 
[02:32:00]  And he had these two other guys as friends.  They were friends.  Used to come over to the house, hang out with them.  And then one day they got a brilliant idea because these two gentlemen that committed  the murder had girlfriends that they couldn't sleep with, I guess, because they lived with  their parents.  You can't bring the girl home because your parents would be angry with you.  So they came up with a great plan.  Just an airtight plan here.  It's going to work very well.  Kill your friend, put him in the basement, and you just move into his house. 
[02:32:30]  Can I ask you guys something?  We've all had friends.  What's the worst thing your friends have ever done to you?  Maybe write dick on your forehead because you had too much to drink one night.  When you're sleeping, partying a little bit.  Shaved off an eyebrow.  Right.  Shaved off an eyebrow, maybe.  Something like that.  Good.  Do the old gag with the warm water.  Put your hand in there so you pee yourself.  I think I once had shaving cream in my hand, and they itched my face while I was asleep,  and I splat inside the face.  When you go to scratch, yeah, you get shaving cream on your face. 
[02:33:00]  That's probably it.  That's probably the worst your friends have done to you, right?  But these friends are a little different.  They sure are.  They saw.  Well, they probably approached him with the idea, can we use your house as a sex den?  And when he said no, evidently these guys had a zero tolerance on cock blocking.  And they rubbed him out.  You think he was like a dick friend?  I would think that they would have approached him.  You think it just doesn't go...  Hey, can I fuck my girl on your couch? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  No.  No.  You're sure about that.  I want you to really think about your answer here.  Because the consequences...  Yeah, you better.  Put it this way.  I'm fucking the girl on the couch.  Yeah, regardless.  You're either going to be here or not.  Yeah, you're right.  They probably didn't just go, hey, let's kill the guy.  It was probably, ask him...  But then they kill him and they just leave him in the basement.  They don't do anything...  No, the second you start wheeling that body around, now you've got a problem. 
[02:34:00]  See, they were thinking ahead.  So they put him down in the basement.  And they had parties and sex with the girls and everything like that.  And moved into his place.  Used his car.  I'm sure that's good for the first 24 hours.  Yeah.  While the dead body's just kind of sitting there with its mouth open downstairs.  I think it could creep you out a little bit.  I think it could creep you out a little bit.  But I think you get...  Yeah, you barrel ahead.  Their whole plan was like the first draft of a bad movie script.  There's like 200 holes in it.  But they didn't fix it.  You don't think that far ahead. 
[02:34:30]  They went with the first draft.  You got a great first scene.  How long does it take for a body to really start smelling?  Start smelling?  A couple of days.  A couple of days you got?  Yeah, a couple of days it's over, Johnny.  So the first two days...  Summer months.  Come on, man.  But the first two days you're sitting there like,  Look, look what we got.  This is cool.  No one's going to know.  Is there any regret, though?  After...  Like, all right, you kill him.  You immediately call the girls.  They come over.  Now you're banging.  You shoot.  You're laying there, relaxed.  Do you think then it creeps in like, 
[02:35:00]  Holy shit, we killed our friend.  Yes.  There's got to be trouble.  That's like when you hook up with some girl you shouldn't be fucking.  Right as you start to cum, you're thinking,  Oh, what did I do?  That's what they were thinking.  Ah, why did we kill him?  Could he just knock them out?  Get an assault charge?  Yeah.  Could have tied him up for a couple days.  I always thought...  Fed him some food.  The crackhead, you always read every so often,  the crackhead that killed his grandma to get the money to buy the crack. 
[02:35:30]  He smokes the crack.  He's feeling all good.  You think right when you start coming down, you're like,  I killed grandma.  Yeah.  God damn, why did I kill grandma?  I think I might have a problem.  Yeah.  You've got to start thinking.  I've got to smoke some more crack so I don't start rationally thinking this.  Right.  And these guys must have gotten done with their first party after killing a guy.  So far, so good.  But then they continued.  They used his car.  One of the neighbors, kind of creepy.  His Lincoln Continental. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  He had a Lincoln Continental with all tinted windows.  And some of the neighbors said,  Wow, I was waving at the car as it was driving by,  thinking it was the neighbor who was already dead.  And they were waving at the guys that had killed their neighbor.  And they were using the car, driving around, picking the girls up, partying.  So far, our plan is, go ahead.  Sex den just sounds so seedy.  Yeah.  It wasn't really, I don't think it was so much sex den as,  sex den sounds like they're bringing prostitutes in,  using it for a business, different girls.  They just, they were guys that wanted to have sex with their girlfriends. 
[02:36:30]  Sex den.  And it sounded like a good plan for the first two days.  Guy had a house, had some nice things.  What happened after the two days?  They stole a few items, too.  Stereos and sold them.  Made a little cake.  And then, I guess during one of these parties,  they noticed it started to stink in the house.  Their friend was rotting.  And they had to do something about it.  So they, it said they put him in bags, pluralized.  Plastic bags and dumped it into the East River. 
[02:37:00]  The East River.  Where it was discovered in the Bronx 12 days after the slaying.  12 days.  Let me guess they found the torso.  The torso.  So, now, maybe they just used numerous bags to cover the one body.  Instead of hacking them up and putting them in different bags and then throwing it.  Regardless, the cops identified the guy.  They figured out who it was.  So they go to the guy's house.  Start talking to the neighbors.  The neighbors are like, wow, he's dead.  I didn't know.  Because there are people coming and going from his house. 
[02:37:30]  As a matter of fact, they're still living there.  So, so.  There's one sitting on the front porch reading the paper.  Yeah, there he is right now.  Without a worry in the world.  And, uh, they arrested these two.  I can't imagine what the defense is going to be.  The defense always comes up with some wacky reason why this happened.  You think if you're that fucking stupid at any point during your jail sentence,  you actually just think of how, you know, you got one life.  This is what you did with it.  Yeah.  You have to. 
[02:38:00]  They did not think further than a day or two ahead in this whole thing.  You don't kill someone premeditated, obviously.  Some type of premeditation to their murder.  And, you know, you go, all right, what happens when people start realizing this guy's missing?  What do we do with the body?  What happens if it's discovered?  What happens?  None of that went on.  It was like, god damn, I gotta fuck my girl.  That's as far as they went.  You got to think you have to go for a long drive. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  You know, you don't just let it sit in the basement for a few days.  Yeah, why?  You would think that's all planned out ahead of time.  And usually you leave the scene of the crime.  You don't move into it.  Move in right there, the scene of the murder.  The first place they're going to go.  Outlining the body and you're two feet away in a lazy boy with your feet up.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You look around.  That's all right.  I'm just watching the plasma TV.  Yeah.  You look whatever you want.  Where is he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Unbelievable.  Didn't think at all. 
[02:39:00]  And the body, you dump the body in the river, it's coming back.  It's coming back.  No, you have to fuck up the torso.  You think?  That's how you do it.  There's bacteria in the intestines.  Yeah.  That after you die, somehow it turns into gases.  That's why they always say police found a headless torso.  Right.  So you remember that book, The Westies I told you to read?  That's what they used to do.  Yeah, they used to.  I'm sorry.  They used to chop the whole thing up.  Chop it up so it don't come back.  So anybody thinking about that, that's what you want to do.  I'm reading another book called Rats. 
[02:39:30]  They had the car, though.  Rats.  Go ahead, Anthony.  What you do, why not put the body in the trunk and you take them somewhere like real?  Why not get a fucking motel for like 28 bucks?  There you go.  I'm thinking of, you know, after they've done this.  Not beforehand while you're actually thinking and going,  why don't I just, you know, get a few bucks, get a hotel room.  Banger in your car.  Banger, right.  Yeah, anything but killing your friend.  Anything else but that.  I'm just thinking afterwards.  They never go far away enough. 
[02:40:00]  Why not?  Obviously, they're not working.  Put him in the car.  Drive to Washington State.  Go into the woods and bury him somewhere.  What's wrong with that?  By the time they find him, figure out who, where, what.  I would just get in the car and drive for 12 hours in one direction.  Just 12 hours.  12 hours.  And when the 12 hours is up, good enough.  Find a secluded place.  Dig a nice hole.  Dump it.  And then drive the 12 hours back and I can still go to work the next day.  You know, they find something. 
[02:40:30]  They find the texture of the dirt.  Don't they always?  Grooves of your tires.  I always get irritated when I watch that.  Like, it's almost like it's not even fair at this point.  The cop will, like, dig a piece of dirt out, send it to the lab, and, bing, Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Oh, yeah.  It pops up.  This dirt is the only, they only have it in Tulsa.  They know exactly where it came from.  You make a good point.  The cops at this point have the upper hand.  Oh, always.  You can't get away with this stuff anymore.  They find out that one hair.  The guy suffocated the girl with the garbage bag, and, like, somehow they saw the imprint of her face. 
[02:41:00]  It's like the shroud of Turin of her face right there on the bag, the plastic.  He tells that story in prison, and I bet those people, they're riveted.  Yeah.  Like, get the fuck out of here.  They caught me murder in progress.  And your shit is just like, 12 years, this fucking person is dead.  One of their fillings fell out, and some guy with a fucking crumb brush in my backyard find it in the, between some blades of grass. 
[02:41:30]  Now I gotta go to jail, worry about getting raped every day.  I mean, what?  You had it knocked.  After 12 years, you gotta think, god damn, did I get away with this shit.  Yeah, my house isn't haunted.  Nothing came back from the grave.  Right.  I'm in the clear.  Haven't had a visit from a cop.  Nothing.  It's just not fair anymore.  And then, police department.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  I love it.  The wrist.  When they just find one stupid, like, pinky bone.  Anything.  They know the race, the age. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  It's amazing.  It's the CSI shows.  I watched it all the time, and guaranteed, about 48 minutes in, I go, you gotta be fucking kidding me.  He had the perfect crime, or did he?  Yeah.  How the body, beyond the grave, solve this murder case.  The dead speak.  Yeah.  How the body talks, beyond the grave, right?  I watch all those shows on A&E.  The real ones.  Like, not the CSI, or the fake ones like that. 
[02:42:30]  But the real ones on A&E.  Oh, yeah.  That guy, what's his name?  The creepy guy.  Bill Curtis.  Oh, Bill Curtis.  I'm Bill Curtis.  Is he creepy, or is it the piano in the background?  Bill Curtis has just that creepy voice.  Bill Curtis is really creepy.  A body of a girl found on the side of the road, raped, and decapitated.  The police went to work.  And then the case goes, yeah, 12, 15 years.  And then there's always, but one cop wouldn't let it go.  He digs into this closet, like, picks this lucky box to pull this, like, cold case down. 
[02:43:00]  And there's the guy that thought he got away with it, because one prick can't fucking just go home to his family one night.  Late one night, he decided to go into the cold case closet.  Motherfucker.  Go home to your family, you cop.  Finds DNA in a toothbrush from 1972.  One bristle.  One bristle.  It's a perfect match.  Yeah.  When the crime happened, they didn't have this type of testing. 
[02:43:30]  Great, thanks.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's the most fucked up thing.  Yeah, we've got to worry about what they're going to invent in the future.  Yeah, you have all bases covered for right now.  Yep.  And in 2026, you get the knock on the door.  Right.  They'll let you know you'll be being raped.  They work it out.  For your final 25 years.  You're an old guy, yeah.  That's the only good thing about that story.  I mean, as far as, like, I always put myself in the position of going to jail.  Looking at those two guys' headshots, they will not be getting raped.  No, not at all.  They will be the rapers.  There's two more rapists in prison. 
[02:44:00]  Their necks are too wide.  You couldn't hold them down.  No.  Let's go to Utah with that.  Ivan.  Hey.  How's it going, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, does this story mention which racial origins these two guys killed?  I believe all three of them involved in this crime.  The perpetrators and the victim were black gentlemen from Freeport, Long Island.  But it leans toward a freaky crime, so I was thinking that it could have been white dudes. 
[02:44:30]  No, it would have to be devil worship related.  Yeah, this was just blunt force violence.  Was it obvious that it was black guys, you think?  Yeah.  Because us whiteys, we pulled the weird crimes.  This definitely has black guy written all over it.  If it's white, like in Northport, you get a very white neighborhood, and one kid was killed by his friends, and that turned out to be Satan worship.  Remember that one?  Oh, yeah, I do.  Yeah, whenever it's Satan worship, you won't find a black guy around.  It's always white guys.  Something like this, though, where you just want to break in, maybe steal some stereo equipment, live in the guy's house, use his car. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, that's the weird thing about black people.  They can ride the subway at four in the morning and totally relax, but you bring up the devil, and they freak out.  Yeah, oh, no, I ain't going in.  Yeah, it's the exact opposite with us.  We're like sitting around painting pentagrams on the floor and drinking whiskey in the woods.  One other thing.  Bunch of creeps.  One other thing as we discuss this topic.  The shallow grave.  Yeah.  Enough with the shallow grave.  Put a little effort into it. 
[02:45:30]  That just screams no planning.  Yeah.  No planning.  I want to get out of here.  A couple more pushes with the shovel.  That's all you have to do.  Dig.  Dig a little.  You've already committed.  Kill in the summer when the earth is soft.  Right.  And you can go six feet under.  The shallow grave is just...  Always ends up a hand poking through a ditch in the ground.  A nosy dog.  Doesn't even refill it.  A nosy dog.  What is a shallow grave?  Leaves?  Yeah.  Leaves in a little dirt.  Like a hole and some leaves. 
[02:46:00]  And the dog always finds it.  Some farmer decides to look at some acreage he had that he hadn't walked on.  One in 50 years.  There has to be some...  People are doing them right.  Yeah.  Because there's a lot of people missing.  There's some people you know.  Obviously we don't know about the missing ones.  Yeah.  But they're missing.  Way up in the mountains.  But someone's doing it right.  Yeah.  They go seven feet down.  Seven feet.  No one's digging that deep.  No one.  No one.  No one's digging that deep.  No one's digging that deep.  No one's digging that deep.  Oh. 
[02:46:30]  Crop circles.  Bigfoot.  And the Loch Ness Monster.  UFOs.  That one looks good.  Very cool.  Is it real?  Monday.  Yeah.  We talked about this guy.  On the...  What is it?  History Channel?  Oh.  The National Geographic Channel.  Okay.  I like that one too.  It's a good channel.  Chris from Boston.  How cool is that psycho Dr. Michael Baden?  That's the guy.  Or Baden from the forensic guy from HBO.  We talked about him last week.  Yeah.  Right?  There's a show called Coroner.  Whatever it is on HBO.  And this guy...  What is it called?  Autopsy.  Autopsy. 
[02:47:00]  Autopsy.  On HBO.  And this guy is a coroner.  He discusses cases that he helped solve after the victims just been cut up.  And he's gone through their stomach and their brains.  And I remember one case he found.  It was...  I got the murder because the time of death didn't line up with the guy's alibi.  Because he went into the stomach and found french fries that they had eaten just fucking...  At a restaurant.  And they knew exactly what time they had been at the restaurant. 
[02:47:30]  And they weren't digested enough for the timeline to have been accurate for the guy that was with the girl.  Jesus, dude.  The serrations.  I'd be the worst defense attorney because my only...  You gotta be shit.  Right, right.  Did this guy ever miss a class in high school and just decide to drink beers with the guy in the parking lot?  They found that the fries had serrations in them from a knife.  A serrated knife.  And they were still visible in the stomach. 
[02:48:00]  Which means that...  And they know how stomach acid would have dissolved it away.  And at what rate.  And how these serrations would have been gone in a certain amount of time.  And since they were still there, she was murdered a lot closer to the time of dinner than the guy was saying.  And boom, guilty.  And you know how they know all that stuff?  I read a book called Stiff.  They got death fields somewhere in the middle of the woods.  Oh, we heard about the death fields, yeah.  Somewhere in like Virginia or somewhere.  I don't know.  And they have all these scenarios.  And they just...  They take cadavers.  They just lay dead bodies all over the woods. 
[02:48:30]  Maybe in a car.  You know, to simulate a car crash.  Shallow graves.  Shallow graves.  Please tell me there's a fence around this area so people aren't just kind of wandering.  You don't just stumble through it.  That'll stick with you for a while, I think.  It was the sickest part of this book called Stiff, which was a book all about what they do with dead bodies.  They had one wrapped in a carpet.  Yeah, they had all these scenarios.  Like someone that's wrapped up in a carpet and thrown in the woods.  Someone that's found in a trunk of a car.  Someone that is this and that. 
[02:49:00]  It gives them like a base.  But it's all the dumb shit that you do after a spontaneous murder.  And they study the bodies and what happens as they rot and stuff.  And what bugs appear and this and that.  So if they find a body rotting...  And they do all their research that way.  They know by the case that they put in, that they know how long...  Can you imagine that's your job, though, to go into the death fields?  You open up that gate of these creepy woods and there's all these dead bodies.  Some hanging from trees because that's some kind of weird scenario and this and that.  And they go in and study the corpses. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, that has to fuck with you.  I don't know how people do that.  How do you get that line of work and not just go home...  Every night, wake up in cold sweats with nightmares.  I can't watch...  How do you go down that progression?  Okay, you take a science class, take biology.  Right?  It's probably the way it starts.  It's kind of interesting.  We all dissected the frog, right?  Right?  Kind of liking that?  Yeah.  Like that?  How do you end up planting a body in the death field?  The dog's a little old. 
[02:50:00]  You think you start getting this fascination?  Yeah, and you just kind of maybe, you know, help him along to his final journey.  Maybe do a little Jeffrey Dahmer.  Yeah.  Just start moving up a little bit.  I think you're the guy, also, that helps the neighbors out when one of their animals die.  And they go, yeah, our cat died or something.  They're the first one to go, I'll take care of it for you.  There's got to be a crossroads there.  When you either pick, I'm causing this or I'm solving it.  You either go the serial killer route.  Absolutely.  I think there is that crossroad. 
[02:50:30]  You can either become the serial killer that's planting the bodies there or the guy that,  because there's a fascination.  There's got to be a passion and a fascination for dead bodies and working with them, whether  it's for your own pleasure.  I asked my dad about that shit.  He's like in the medical field.  Yeah.  And I said, like, how does somebody become like a proctologist?  Why would you choose that?  Why?  Out of all the places.  And he was just kind of laughing.  He's just like, well, you know, you go and you do the cadaver thing and all that.  And after a while, I guess the whole thing's kind of disgusting in a way to include in 
[02:51:00]  a body.  And he's like, you know, it's a good paying job.  You just start thinking, hey, you know, I'm making strong six figures a year.  It's down to the money.  The first time he just pokes somebody in the ass, you've got to be laughing.  I'm just horrified the first time.  You think it's like, because it is the first time, so you've got to be like, here it comes.  It's my first time I'm sticking my finger up the guy's ass.  Pull it out, you.  I mean, there's that third grader in all of us. 
[02:51:30]  You're just going to fucking lose it.  I'm laughing.  Hey, Brad Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, just wanted to check in.  When I was a kid, when I grew up in the country, basically,  there was a bunch of murderers that they had way out in the boonies.  And what they were doing was hacking up the bodies and actually feed them to the pigs.  Because the pigs would eat anything and everything in its sight.  Oh, you're getting your info from the movie Snatch, aren't you?  And from...  No.  From Deadwood.  No.  Oh, Deadwood did that whole thing, too? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, they do.  They feed him to the pig thing.  We've got to get that clip from Snatch, how he explains how to get rid of a body by using pigs.  Deeply, deeply disturbing.  Let's go to Tom in New Hampshire.  Tom, what's going on, buddy?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing, boys?  All right.  Hi, Jimmy Replacement.  That's hilarious.  During your last break, I switched over to Imus, and one of the callers was trying to get him to say that his favorite station was The Fan. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  And he said, oh, no, my favorite station's Opie and Anthony on 202 on XM.  Bravo.  Hey, there you go.  This guy, he's just a great friend in the business, helping us out.  Yep.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  I heard Don Imus went and visited the body farm, and they tried to plant him.  Hey, uh, assumed.  Mistaken identity.  Dan and, uh, Raleigh, what's up?  Hey, man, that guy just told my stuff here.  I'm an Imus listener, too, and I was going to tell you the same thing.  Hey, does anyone listen to our show while we're doing our show, I mean? 
[02:53:00]  They've got to keep an ear open for everybody else.  Well, that's the beauty of the replays.  Don Imus really could just work in a haunted house, like, no makeup.  Boo.  Yeah.  Big stupid cowboy hat, like he's a rebel.  Yeah, he's got a cowboy hat.  I'm fucking 78 years old.  Uh, Jack in Manchester.  What's up, Jack?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Uh, when I was a kid, it was this kid named Shane Tetz.  Uh, he was, like, on my school bus.  He was a babysitter and shit.  He looked right behind me.  He, uh, took a bunch of acid and killed his pregnant girlfriend. 
[02:53:30]  Like, took a revolver, shot her six times, reloaded it.  She had another three.  Wow.  Wrapped her up in an old oriental rug barrier in a wine cellar.  Wrote a whole note to the parents.  I'm missing her.  I'm missing her.  I don't know where she went.  Stuff like that.  I bought a bus ticket, did the whole thing, got caught because his brother's dog was digging  at the dirt in the wine cellar.  So that's how he ended up getting caught.  Going to jail, ended up becoming somebody's bitch and overdose on heroin, like, two years  ago.  Wow.  See, at that point, you've got to kill your pets and stuff, because they know a little 
[02:54:00]  more than us.  They love rolling around in that dead meat.  Exactly.  They're going to rat you out.  Their senses are a little stronger than ours.  Yeah.  Right off the bat, you've got to kill your dog if you're going to bury a body in your  house.  You never, you don't bury it in your house?  Not in your house.  Those are real nuts that want them close to them, I think.  Like John Wayne Gacy, putting all of them down in his crawl space, and he'd have lime  down there and dig the holes, bury them, and then put lime over them.  How do you sleep at night?  But it was part of it. 
[02:54:30]  He loved having the bodies that close to him.  It was like he was a collector, so.  I think he's the creepiest out of all of them.  Yeah.  Clown.  He was like a party clown.  Here's all the features of a complete freak.  What was going on in the 70s when you could fucking drive around dressed as a clown in  a van and nobody was looking at you?  With a dead body in the trunk and no one's looking.  No one's looking.  No one's looking at your background.  Well, the drugs were a lot better back then.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tennessee.  Ben, what's up?  Hey, man.  You guys are great, by the way.  I've been loving you for about six months now. 
[02:55:00]  And we care why.  I was a coroner up in Virginia, and they brought me a hand.  Well, they called me at two in the morning and said, we got a hand we need you to look  at.  And it ended up being like a child's hand.  But we investigated further, and it ended up being a bear paw and just kind of screwed  everybody up for a while.  They started the manhunt.  And it was pretty interesting.  They mistook a bear paw for a hand. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, it's easy to confuse.  We did x-rays, and it didn't quite look right.  And then we called the chief.  We gave it away the fur.  You know, I got a similar story.  When I was living out there in Huntington, my landlord was digging up the front yard.  No, digging up the porch.  That's right.  Because part of the porch in the front of the house was rotting.  So he was going to redo the porch, and he's digging up, I guess, to get some studs in  the ground or whatever.  And all of a sudden, he found some bones.  And they looked like human bones.  Were they big?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they looked like they could be bones from a child. 
[02:56:00]  Oh.  So he was ex-NY PD, and he works for the fire department and all that.  So he thought, I better do the right thing.  So he calls the cops.  They completely took over the house, yellow-taped the whole area.  That's great for the neighbors.  Oh, yeah.  Cops.  I'm not seeing that going on.  Cops everywhere.  I come home, you know, because I'm renting from this guy.  All the cops that are there are fans of the show.  There's another starting to think crazy shit in their heads. 
[02:56:30]  Like, I knew he was a wacko on the air, but wait a minute.  What's going on here?  And they kind of hinted, like, you might want to stay close, because they really don't know  what the hell's going on.  It's so early in the investigation.  I'm like, what?  So we had to wait around all day.  I don't know, like four to six hours, let's say.  And they finally came back from the lab saying, all right, and then, you know, it was like  a pig or a pig bones or a rag.  I forgot exactly.  Honestly, I forget now.  I don't remember exactly what the bones are. 
[02:57:00]  It was some animal, you know, that, you know, the bones were under the porch for whatever  reason.  That's odd.  But for an afternoon, it was all...  Still something goes.  The yellow tape was...  Ritual.  Yeah, definitely something strange there.  Unless somebody got drunk and planned on doing one of those pig pit barbecues and forgot  about it.  Bury him under the ground with the coals and then forgot.  But for an afternoon, it was...  Pig picking.  Yeah.  That's what it's called.  A lot of excitement.  Pig picking.  Let's say hi to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, guys.  All right.  What's up? 
[02:57:30]  I was just...  I had read a book on that body farm.  It's just outside Knoxville, Tennessee.  Oh, there's one in Knoxville, Tennessee?  Okay.  Yeah, and I guess it was started by a university over there.  And they bring, like, coroner students in from all across the country.  And it's just like you were saying.  This is what...  It's a plastic bag.  After five days, there's going to be this kind of bug on it.  I mean, it is amazing.  Yeah, they have all scenarios.  You know, people that are, like, wrapped up in, yeah, exactly, garbage bags and rugs and trunks.  I don't know if I want to live next door to that, though, man. 
[02:58:00]  I guess they have 50 to 100 bodies at any given time.  Yeah, just rotting away.  After you do it, there's no way to watch a horror movie and even be remotely scared at that point.  Just so clinically looking at the makeup.  Oh, yeah, it's like a trunk.  Seven days in the sun in July.  I can't even watch some of those scary movie trailers anymore at night.  They've gotten really creepy.  They've gotten very real.  They've gotten just creepy where I can't take the surprise out of nowhere shot. 
[02:58:30]  Like, they show some guy, and he's sitting on a couch or something, and he bends over to grab something,  and the camera follows him as he grabs it.  When he leans back, there's someone sitting next to him out of nowhere.  That shit kills me.  I cannot watch it.  I avert my eyes from the television like a pussy.  Yeah, horror movies are back.  They sucked in the 80s.  Yeah, they turned into just the slasher things I could watch.  Who cares? 
[02:59:00]  You know, like Jason and those things.  Not scary.  But the ones that are like the creepy, distorted faces and little children are always creepy in movies.  Oh, yeah.  And they've made a big comeback in movies now.  Creepy children?  Yeah, ever since The Shining with those two twin girls in the hallway, just creepy.  And now they put kids in movies all the time.  You hear the little...  Oh, get me out of here.  I'm not watching.  Did you like Blair Witch? 
[02:59:30]  A lot of people were like, eh, that sucks.  Yeah, I thought it was pretty creepy.  I went to that by myself.  I was living in L.A.  Yeah.  I saw the 1230 show after I'd worked at like a lap day.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  That last shot with a dude standing in the fucking corner.  That's what got me.  And then I walked out through the parking garage by myself, freaked the fuck out.  I can't take stuff like that.  And some people say, it's soaked.  It was another...  And other people, scariest thing they ever saw.  That was creepy.  Yeah, a lot of people saw Blair Witchwood.  I was laughing the whole time.  That was fucking lame.  I bought it from the second it was on. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Well, yeah, that's one of those movies you had to get in early, you know?  Yeah.  You had to watch it early before everyone started really talking about it.  Same with like Sixth Sense.  Sixth Sense was creepy as all hell, too.  That chick puking and the frigging underneath and his little fort thing when he runs in it  and there's people out there and the mother in the kitchen and just creepy shit.  Usually I see the endings of movies coming like no problem.  That was one of the only movies where I actually stood up in the theater when they had the twist  at the end and I actually stood up and went, no fucking way! 
[03:00:30]  I just lost my mind.  Like, they fucking tricked us.  And it was a full theater, but I was just taken by, you know, what they did.  It was the only time I got out of my seat and actually said something in a movie theater.  The Ring?  The Ring, yeah.  That was really creepy.  I saw that in Peoria, Illinois with this comic, Pete Holmes.  We walk in, I swear to go, we saw like the two o'clock show on like a fucking Wednesday.  We were the only two people in there.  And both of us are trying to act like we're not freaked out by this. 
[03:01:00]  The first time when that girl was in the closet and her head comes over and her jaw drops.  Oh, man.  I saw her face.  Wink!  Ah!  I couldn't take it.  Plus, I also think women being the murderer is way more scary.  Creepier.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was, and that whole weird video that they played with the woman in the mirror brushing  her hair, just that shit alone creeps me out.  Oh.  So much I can't, ugh.  Going down in the well in that fucking water, I can't tell. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Creepy.  They look like instant messages like, this guy's a pussy.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Real men on the instant feedback.  Hey, pussy, pussy, shut up.  I'm scared.  Let's take another call and then we'll move on to other things.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Actually, I got to the University of Tennessee and I was actually able to go to the body farm.  You went to one of these body farms?  Yes, it was amazing.  Good time?  The one in Knoxville, Tennessee? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  It was pretty wild.  There's probably 30 to 40 bodies in different stages of decomposition.  It was very amazing.  Wow.  Thanks, guys.  Sir?  Gary?  Sir?  Yes?  Your call stinks.  Is your brain decomposing in front of our eyes?  Like you're losing your mind here.  Yeah.  It's like you've been to someplace unbelievably interesting and you're not giving us any details. 
[03:02:30]  You're just going, we went down.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  So what happened?  Ah, it was wild.  Walking on campus.  Sorry.  If we had a whole show of callers like this, we would have no audience.  You understand that, right?  Yeah.  All right.  He's probably just a little nervous.  Someone has to see back here.  Yes.  Yeah.  I understand.  I suck.  That's why I just like dealing with dead bodies.  They don't hurt me the way you guys just did.  I could finally relate to your show, so I figured I'd better call.  Call.  I might think better of us. 
[03:03:00]  Ant, the creepiest trailer ever, and I agree with this.  This was really bad.  Was the girl from The Exorcist crawling down the stairs backwards on her hands and feet.  Remember, she was doing kind of a crab, upside down crab walk, but her head was turned the other way.  And, like, any time a body gets distorted like that, I can't watch it.  Crease me out.  And this is the color describing that.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  It's real scary.  Get us out of here, Derek.  It's pretty wild.  Life in corporate America can be a grind. 
[03:03:30]  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation.  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in, and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area. 
[03:04:00]  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat checks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go, click.  Take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations.  You send them to training to not have those big kids showing during the work.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor.  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships. 
[03:04:30]  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management.  130, Human Resources, attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  135, they're wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor.  Ha ha!  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  That's a good one, Ant. 
[03:05:00]  That is creepy.  Read that one.  42nd Street, Matt.  Hey, guys.  When I was seven years old, my older cousin told my mom they were taking me to see Tron.  Remember the movie Tron?  Instead, I was treated to a viewing of Poltergeist.  Holy shit. 
[03:05:30]  I'm fucking seven years old.  I lost it when the guy tore his face off.  Nightmares for weeks.  Absolutely.  That movie, for the time now, it's a little dated.  You're watching, like, meh.  It looks a little cheesy.  No, man.  That midget lady's still creepy as shit.  This house is clean.  She is creepy.  Walk toward the light.  I told you that story, though.  When I was a kid, my parents decided to take me.  I guess they didn't want to spring for a babysitter that night.  Took me to see Bonnie and Clyde.  Now, I was... 
[03:06:00]  That's not a scary movie.  I'm a little kid.  This is, like, 1969 or something.  I was a little tot.  What were you laughing?  Well, because you know Groucho, so 1969.  I don't know Groucho.  I met Groucho once.  By 1969, you had to be at least 17.  My early 20s.  I was a tiny kid.  Bill, you're talking to a guy that met Groucho Marx.  I met Groucho in...  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  We don't know how old he is.  I met Groucho, oh, my God.  We started to think he's a vampire or something. 
[03:06:30]  I met Groucho in 1975.  He was pretty much on his deathbed.  No, he was working out at fucking Gold's Gym.  He was on the road.  Me and Groucho.  We found out the other day that if Groucho was alive, he'd be, like, 108 or something.  Anthony met him.  He was an old man.  He died, like...  He ran track with him in high school.  All right.  Bonnie and Clyde.  1969.  Yeah.  Took me to see Bonnie and Clyde. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  And I vomited all over the inside of the car.  It was at a drive-in.  And I vomited all over the place.  What are they pointing at?  Jesus.  There's something going on.  Oh, Maury.  Yeah.  I know.  Maury.  We're only getting this out of one...  The doctor told Tarja, her daughter, would never be able to walk or talk, and she'd be  a vegetable. 
[03:07:30]  Tashana.  Tashana.  That's good.  I got it.  I got it.  Whatever you did.  Just don't touch it.  Dancing and singing.  Something's wrong with her, though.  I should be dead, but I'm a miracle survivor is the title of today's show.  We just had Maury on the other day.  She loves you.  How about that?  I mean, it's amazing.  Yeah, this is great.  And I just want to tell you, no matter what nobody say, keep your head up and keep God  first.  You don't need anybody but your mother and your family and God and your family.  Does she have to say, keep your head up? 
[03:08:00]  That is twice the size of a normal one.  Jesus, Opie.  Oh, sure.  We can hang out.  I'll come and see you.  Right.  And we have a special prize.  It was for you.  Oh, a special surprise, Maury.  Maury is a creep.  Maury has a special surprise for Tashana and her mom.  What's the surprise?  Tonight is Girls' Night Out.  We're going to eat at Mango's.  Right.  We're going to go hang out at a little spot.  I'm going to cancel my reservation at Mango's.  How's that?  It's Girls' Night Out tonight.  How's that?  You're going to hang out, girl.  Okay. 
[03:08:30]  Can you tell me all about it when you get back?  Okay, my dear.  Thank you so much.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  By the way, Tweets' new CD is in the stores.  It's called It's Me Again.  So we want to thank you, Tashana.  We want to thank your mom.  I think Maury is thinking about us right now.  Of course.  Of course.  All right.  Get her off.  Next freak.  Bring in the next freak.  Let's see what the next freak is.  We're going to get in a life and death struggle with Mother Nature.  The destruction was just happening so fast.  And then me and my family were going to die if we didn't get out of there. 
[03:09:00]  I was so scared.  I thought we were going to die.  She was shot point blank in the mouth.  Uh-oh.  And lost half of her face.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened to your baby?  Rabbit.  There she was, bella the ball, at her very own princess birthday party.  Want more, Maury?  Get the inside.  I don't want to see that.  No.  We had Maury in the other day.  We really hit it off.  It turns out he's a big fan of the show, listens all the time.  Yeah.  Maury's probably listening right now.  Maury, uh, he is truly the new P.T. Barnum. 
[03:09:30]  He just, it's just, it's a freak show.  If he's not doing freaks, he's doing the paternity test.  Yeah.  That's what he does.  But he brings people on.  Like, the one subject he has is, I'm, I'm a person, don't stare at me.  It's like one of the subjects.  And then he parades people on to have more people look at them than we'll ever see them  in a lifetime.  You're a special little girl. 
[03:10:00]  You're, you know something?  You're beautiful inside.  And then he brings out a singer that is desperate for the publicity.  Right, the publicity.  Her new album's available.  Like, I know, that was really bad.  Maury, I'm a bodega on 155th Street.  Like, it's nobody's, you know?  I'll sing to that walking piece of chop meat, Maury, but I want a plug.  Right, I'll do whatever you say as long as you plug my CD and when it's dropping.  Oh, Jesus.  They go way down the ladder to find these people to sing. 
[03:10:30]  What if she's going to blow that girl off at the after party?  Of course.  And mangoes?  Hey.  They're going to mangoes.  Hey, remember me?  She'll probably just stop in, say hi.  Is everything good?  Is your dinner okay?  All right, I got to run.  That's it.  Yeah.  Just leaves her there with her mother and a bunch of horrified customers.  We got to say hi to an old friend, Jeff Norris, everybody.  Hello there.  How are you?  Remember Jeff Norris?  Of course.  Jeff, how you been?  How you doing, buddy?  Good, he good.  You do realize we've been...  What's up, man?  How are you?  Jeff used to be on our old show all the time when we were doing commercial radio, and you 
[03:11:00]  do realize we've been back for almost a year, right?  Longer than that.  I haven't seen you in about three, two, three years.  Jeff's claim to fame is he was our first guest ever on our show at N.E.W.  How about that?  We had to start somewhere.  I was going to say, it got me a lot of success.  I'm still spackling in the daytime.  And he was the voice of the Frosted Mini Wheat on the Mini Wheats commercial.  I eat Cheerios now.  Fuck them.  All they do is talk about the fiber.  They got all old people and fiber. 
[03:11:30]  Now it's not about the frosted side.  You don't like them anymore?  Oh, I'm out of work.  I'm unemployed.  Oh, no.  But they gave you a good living for a while.  No, I mean, it's good.  You just fucked yourself out of any sort of reunion.  That's okay.  Here, do your voice.  Sometimes they bring it back.  Can you do the voice at least so people around America go, oh, that guy.  It's a Frosted Pesci.  Yeah.  That's all it is.  I'm sweet and delicious.  You're healthy and nutritious.  If we work together in harmony, we realize we're actually a pretty good team.  That's him. 
[03:12:00]  That's the Mini Wheat.  You got a Frosted side, too?  I close my eyes, man.  Yeah, here he is.  It's the Mini Wheat.  Oh, holy shit.  Now he's like, fuck that cereal.  No, I don't know.  Now I eat cereals.  You're listening to Colman.  Tony the Tiger's a prick.  I went out for Tony the Tiger, too.  Fuck Boris Karloff.  The Mini Wheat can't eat my shit.  That motherfucker.  Oh, man.  Did you get a lot of free Mini Wheats from doing that?  Not a box.  Not one box.  Not one box.  They didn't mail you one loud box. 
[03:12:30]  Not one box.  They give you a little something.  My mother bought me one when I got the deal.  That was it.  My mother.  My mother.  Did you ever try to get free Mini Wheats from the supermarket or something?  I do that as a gag every once in a while when we're in a magazine.  I try to get the magazine for free.  I go, hey, you just want to show the person behind the counter you're in it.  I go, hey, if you're in the magazine, do you get it for free?  And they laugh like, oh, silly stuff.  It's hard to prove.  And then I show them and still got to pay.  Put the Mini Wheat box.  I usually, when we're, I remember flying a few times and having us have a big article 
[03:13:00]  in one of the magazines and I sit there in first class as everyone's walking through  and I'll open up to my picture and tilt a little to the aisle and drink my Bloody Mary.  Like, this is why I'm up here.  Get in the back and row.  This is a good question.  You've got to take it where you can, Bill.  Let's go to Keith in New York.  Keith.  Keith and Pete, Danny's a moron, but either way.  All right, I'm sorry, bro. 
[03:13:30]  No, it's all right.  I want to know if the Frost and Mini Wheat guy knows the Angry Baby.  Yeah.  Bob Kelly's doing the Angry Baby.  Did you hear that, Danny Wheat guy?  Bob Kelly.  He what?  He wants to what?  No, he's doing a character called Angry Baby now.  For voiceover work and it sounds exactly like your Frost and Mini Wheat.  Does it?  Yeah.  We did a whole thing yesterday on the show.  Great.  A whole thing.  So what have you been up to, Jeff?  I'm just spackling in a day.  You're really spackling.  I should not admit that.  No, I bought a house, so I'm fixing it up.  Oh, there you go. 
[03:14:00]  But performing, doing a lot in Vegas, doing a lot around here.  Vegas?  Yeah.  What are you doing there?  The Tropicana.  You got a Vegas gig?  Yeah, five times a year I'm out there.  And are you encouraged?  Yeah, it's still Bob, but he's doing some different stuff.  He'll bring guys back on a regular.  And it's nice because it's just a two-man show rather than a three.  So you're supposed to also bring your other friends in show business  and encourage them to perhaps perform at this club?  Well, no.  I don't give a shit. 
[03:14:30]  Nobody help me.  I don't give a shit.  I ain't helping anybody.  I performed out there about eight years ago.  It was one of my first headlining gigs.  And I was bombing so bad, they actually bumped me down to the middle act.  And they made the middle act close.  It's not an easy room.  People get close.  Yeah, it's like people that aren't there just to see comedy.  No, no.  I mean, it's a good gig.  I like it, but...  Yeah?  Yeah, it's good.  How big a room?  About 400.  400?  Yeah.  Like gamblers and people that don't want to go see.  People are pissed off. 
[03:15:00]  They just lost their mortgage on a slot.  That's like...  Walk in there.  Yeah, they're not...  When you go to a comedy club, people have gone down there to see a comedian.  Yeah.  This, it's like, oh, we got tickets.  We were comped.  Yeah, it's like the first three days.  Hell, I...  They have locals night.  But the weekends are good.  Thursday through Sunday's night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anybody in there is taking a break from losing.  Right.  Right.  Because if you're winning, you're still going to be out there.  And most of the people that are in there want to be out gambling.  Right.  They're taking a break, but they're like, eh, I could be at the table right now. 
[03:15:30]  And if you go a minute over, they fly you home.  Because they want people back in the casino losing more money.  Of course.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  It's not too bad.  I'll keep it.  You're doing all right.  I'm doing all right.  Let's go to Ken in Jersey.  Ken, what's up?  Hey.  I want to say hello to Jeff.  Hey, Jeff, I don't know if you remember me.  We were playing Urgo and Rascals in Ocean Township Monday.  And I don't know who the other comic was, but somebody was heckling.  Remember you and I got into the fight with a bunch of assholes?  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Do you remember that?  That was with Greg Morton. 
[03:16:00]  Greg Morton.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember.  Oh, my.  I got to tell you this story real quick.  You got cut.  And remember the bartender got hit over the head with the bottle?  Yeah.  That was crazy.  This was at a comedy club?  This was at Rascals in Ocean Township.  Yeah, buddy.  I remember you and I took the guys outside, beat the shit out of them out in the park a lot.  They ran.  Yeah, I'm still paying that fine.  No, you're not.  Do you know Greg Morton, Bill?  Have you ever heard of Greg Morton?  No.  He's a black guy from Canada.  He's really good.  I mean, he's a great impressionist, great comedian.  And he's a light-skinned black guy. 
[03:16:30]  So there were some people there, and he does a joke saying that when he was a kid, his mother nearly beat the black off of him.  And he says, it's dear and dear worked.  I grew up beige, you know.  Some guy in the audience goes, yeah, but you're still an N.  Like, screams it out.  Wow.  And next thing you know, the bouncer comes over.  He hits the bouncer in the head with his Jack Daniels glass, and his big fight breaks out.  So I went over to help the guy, and it was three guys.  Any time there's a fight, you can always depend on the jump jump in.  I mean, the bouncer was getting, like, hit in the face with a Jack Daniels glass.  It was terrible. 
[03:17:00]  Split him wide open, kicking him.  And he didn't.  I remember you.  Norris is an animal, by the way.  No, I'm not.  Have you killed anyone yet?  No, I'm not a bad guy.  You buried him in a shower plug.  It's the shirt.  It's the shirt?  I behave.  I'm not a bad guy.  Remember when Jeff ruined my vacation?  What did he do?  Oh, a chokehold.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you asked me.  He goes, teach me a chokehold.  I did not.  You were demonstrating what you did to some guy after you brought him out of Caroline.  Remember the guy that was biting my ankle? 
[03:17:30]  That's why I defended you.  What?  Some guy.  You were there.  Some guy went over and said that you two sucked or something.  Some guy was.  No, you know what?  He was trying to come off like a fan.  He was like, I love the show.  Dude, you're great.  And then he bows down.  He's like, oh, you're fantastic.  And then he starts biting.  He tried to bite my ankle.  He was like, I need to get drunk off his ass.  So Norris sees this, comes over, picks the guy up, and escorts him out of the club, which  is fine.  I was laughing my ass off.  I thought it was great. 
[03:18:00]  Then I go upstairs after the gig, and Norris is upstairs, and I go, what did you do to  that guy after you got him upstairs?  He goes, ah, choked him out.  I was like, get the fuck out of here.  He goes, no, really.  And then he demonstrates on me what he did.  And I hate when people that are real good at martial arts.  You said, show me.  No, I didn't mean show me.  I know Anthony.  He wouldn't have said, show me.  Because I can't stand when people that fight or do martial arts actually go, so, all right,  stand there.  And I'll show you, like, let me grab your arm, and I want no part of that.  No part of it.  Those holes that just, just, so he goes, I grab him like this, and then he puts it, the 
[03:18:30]  crook of his arm around my throat, and squeezes.  Now, for Norris, it's like nothing.  To him, he barely even moved.  To me, it's a death hold.  He, like, did something where I had a sore throat and couldn't talk for a week.  It was right before I was on vacation.  I was on, I'm on vacation, like, I'll take another banana daiquiri, please.  I couldn't talk, I had a crushed windpipe or something, and he almost choked me out with  a split second, little crook of his arm, just, ding, little thing, and no blood to my 
[03:19:00]  head.  Unbelievable.  Two pounds of pressure.  That's it.  That's all you need.  That's all you need.  You can't make me sound like such a thug.  Just a couple of foot pounds per second per second.  I love the little son of a bitch.  Oh, wow.  Sorry I couldn't get here on time, man.  Coming here was crazy.  I got up at 5.30 this morning to be here at 9.15, and it took, like, four and a half  hours from New Jersey to get here.  I'm not even kidding you. 
[03:19:30]  High security out there.  Oh, no, not that.  The parkway, Garden State Parkway and the turnpike, and then coming through the tunnel.  You like the new joint?  It's crazy.  Yeah, it's very nice.  It's kind of weird, right?  It's in a good way.  In a good way.  No, in a great way.  We built this thing.  It seems more, that's what I'm saying, it seems more personal.  We designed the whole studio and everything.  Yeah, it's cool.  And you see all those cubicles?  They were supposed to be gone four months ago.  We gave up on that.  Yeah, but supposedly they're giving us this whole space.  No, it looks cool, man.  And we're going to have, like, a stage and stuff and a pole for girls.  Oh, it's going to be hooked up.  It's going to be hooked up. 
[03:20:00]  But that was supposed to happen already.  Remember, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  These guys were supposed to be out of here already.  Yeah.  Because they're staring at me over the cubicles.  What did they do?  Hello?  They work for you?  They work for you.  Every company needs dead weight, I guess, so they're just kind of, you know, they just  kind of do, we don't know what they do.  They just stare at computers and think about what 20 songs they want to play.  You know, it's stupid stuff.  I saw Earl.  Yeah, Earl's now producing Ron and Fez.  I saw Earl.  Oh, wow. 
[03:20:30]  He's the executive producer of Ron and Fez.  That's pretty good.  So.  All right.  We should move on to other things here.  A lot of business.  Well, we got audio from Danny Bonaduce's new show.  Have you seen this thing yet, Phil?  No.  Psycho.  I hear it's a clusterfuck.  Although Anthony's making me sound like him now.  No.  No, not at all.  You're just a fight animal.  I really am not.  I really walk away.  I really do.  This show has potential.  A lot of these reality shows, it's getting old, but the celebrity reality shows are really 
[03:21:00]  starting to take off, and some of them are really good.  The Hulk Hogan one stinks.  It's awful, because it's all fake and staged.  The surreal life is really good.  Mm-hmm.  They got that new show with the Brady kid there.  Yeah.  Coming up on the surreal life.  Peter Brady and his girlfriend.  Right.  He's like in his 40s, and she's a 20-something.  She's the next top model or something.  22 or something like that.  Yeah, 22.  Ridiculously hot.  And they hooked up, so they decided to make a show out of it. 
[03:21:30]  A little spin-off.  Any time there's a speck of interest in one of these reality shows, like any little highlight,  they spin it off and make it's own show.  Yeah.  Same thing.  I was like, oh, that was entertaining.  Now, when you take it in the context of the show, it's entertaining.  It doesn't mean it could stand alone by itself and be entertaining.  And it wasn't.  That whole thing with flavor.  It's like when they tried to give the Ropers their own show.  Yeah.  That did not work.  Or Flo off of Alice.  It's like people barely watched Alice. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  And they hook up Flo.  They go, well, we'll just have you say, kiss my grits every episode.  Kiss my grits.  Kiss my grits.  This is fantastic.  Well, the Danny Bonaduce show, I got to tell you, it has potential.  Yeah.  Later on in the series, I guess he tries to kill himself.  It gets so bad.  The show starts with him.  Say that for the finale.  Him and his wife that he cheats on all the time.  He's an alcoholic.  He does steroids.  All this shit.  Sex addict is what he says.  Every clip I see, he's just screaming at somebody. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's got like, I'm out of my fucking mind.  He's got roid rage and all that.  And he's got a kid in the business, so he's driving her to auditions and stuff.  He's got a kid in the business?  Yeah.  I guess the show got what?  Really?  How old?  I want to say 11, maybe.  Isn't that how he got fucked up?  Yeah.  That's what I was just going to say.  That's cruel.  Is that that kid that he brought to that?  Remember when we were out in L.A.?  When we first started at AAF?  Right.  At the comedy store?  And he had a baby and a stroller? 
[03:23:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Jesus.  When we met him out there?  Yeah.  That time do march on.  Well, she's now in the business, and he's going to prove that you could be in the business  as a child actor and have a normal life.  Ah.  One of the angles that the show's taken.  Well, the show's getting, or got so out of control, they took the kids right out of it.  They told the kids, you know, live with somebody else, or we're not continuing with this show.  Because the shit that was going on, I guess VH1, whoever filmed it, just couldn't do it anymore.  So it's pretty real, then.  It seems pretty real.  Yeah.  It's like his whole life is falling apart right on the screen. 
[03:23:30]  But I guess he's all right, because he'll be on our show very soon, so I guess he survived  the whole thing.  The name is weird, though.  It's called Breaking Bonaduce.  Breaking Bonaduce.  It's almost like, implying like VH1 was leaving the drugs around.  Like, let's fucking break this guy.  Let's get him.  Yeah.  I know we can put him over the edge.  Yeah.  But you know, we're in the business.  We had Harry Reams in yesterday.  He's clean and sober for 16 years.  We were trying.  We fake applause for the guy, but in our minds, we're like, how can we break him? 
[03:24:00]  How can we break him?  Oh, I saw you do that with Bernie Getz.  Right.  Yeah, same thing.  Bernie, we wanted Bernie to snap.  You just tried to figure out how to break these people.  And Harry Reams, we showed him the first live chick's pussy that he's seen since he was  married, like 16 years.  And he went right into the character?  Oh, he was like, yeah.  All of a sudden, he started mumbling under his voice.  He's like, yeah, that's nice.  Ooh, yeah.  Making noises he hadn't made since he was doing porno.  Loved it.  He's barely hanging in there. 
[03:24:30]  You can see it in his eyes.  Just nail scraping.  I got to hold on 16 years.  I'm a successful real estate agent.  I like your age, Benny, yesterday.  Oh, it was key.  He was telling great stories.  Good one.  He told a story where he doesn't remember from, I think it was 85 to 89.  He swears he just doesn't remember four years of his life.  Well, that one episode he talks about, he was staying in a hotel or at a hospital, rehab.  He was trying to go through with some kind of rehab.  They put him in a hospital here in New York City.  They would give him quarters for the telephone every day.  Well, he would stock away these quarters, and then when he had enough, he went out and bought some booze with it. 
[03:25:00]  He got hammered, just bought like a half a gallon of vodka, drinks that down.  He wakes up four days later in the Los Angeles County Jail, 3,000 miles away, in jail.  Still, to this day, has no clue how he got from New York to L.A. and ended up in jail.  How do you go that far?  Hey, you can't be that fucked up and get on a plane.  Yeah, on a plane, driving, hitching.  You have to function. 
[03:25:30]  You have to be able to move locomotion.  But that is fucked up.  That is hammered.  That really is.  Oh, Maury.  Jesus, Maury.  Six months pregnant.  You were six months pregnant when you were shot.  What happened to your baby?  She's doing fine.  She's doing fine.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank God.  This is the one that was shot point blank in the face.  Shot in the face with a shotgun by her boyfriend or something. 
[03:26:00]  How much do you have a pelican chin?  Oh, you are the one.  Well, you got to make the, you got to paint the pictures for the audience, eh?  Pelican.  That's severe that if I never got to help as fast as I did.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Shark attack.  Oh.  There's a person who saved your life, wasn't there?  This shooting happened like one, two.  No, I nursed myself back to fucking help.  The tongue is brutal.  You notice that?  The tongue is hanging out of her mouth.  And like a door.  Yeah.  It's not bad enough to do a dramatization of her being shot in the face. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  You hear that with the black and white?  Yeah.  It's like a bulldog.  You ever see if a bulldog with his tongue just won't go in?  Yeah, yeah.  It's all dried out.  That's a mastiff.  And there are lots of pieces of this puzzle that we want to just kind of put together so  we have an entire puzzle all done when it's over.  And the first big piece we got to bring out is your daughter.  Your chin.  Oh, Maury.  Oh, Maury.  Maury. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Listen to Maury.  Look at you.  Hi, Mohanis.  Oh, Mohanis.  Mohanis, who is that?  That's Grandma.  Who's that?  Grandma.  Is that your Grandma?  Who's that, Mohanis?  She's 25.  Grandma's 25 years old.  Holy crap.  Are you kidding me?  You helped save your mom's life.  That's great-great-grandma.  Her prom's tonight.  That is horrific.  Tonight is her 30th birthday. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, jeez.  All right.  So, uh...  Mess.  Breaking Bonaduce.  You want to hear some audio from this thing?  Sure.  It's pretty good.  Danny had an affair not too long ago, and I've been trying to deal with the damage of that.  Looking back on it now, I should have seen it happening.  But, you know, at the time, I really didn't realize that it was happening.  I actually told you it was happening.  No, you didn't.  And I gave you a pretty clear heads up.  Okay.  Do you remember this conversation?  Honey, I know you don't like sex. 
[03:28:00]  Somebody better start having some sex with me soon.  So, the reason that you had the affair was because you weren't having sex?  You know what?  I actually don't want to think of God and it slips the other direction.  I have to get this in because it's, I think, really relevant.  When he was having the affair, he was getting the relationship that he deserved.  No, we were not having sex because he was having sex somewhere else.  He wasn't getting any sex from me, and why should he have?  Having that affair meant when you were withholding sex from him that he was...  Well, this woman had no mercy for me and my children.  None.  You just see these letters that she's written to him. 
[03:28:30]  They're all like, oh, you're my husband.  And, you know, like, me and the kids didn't even exist.  Gretchen, I've got to tell you, I mean, that freaks me out.  It freaks me out.  That's so, like, over the edge.  I'm trying to understand how that happens.  How did that happen?  I don't care about sex that much.  I mean, I don't.  I just feel like I'm more involved and I have better things to do.  He is a sex addict, totally.  Do you think you're a sex addict?  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  Holy crap.  So, the wife ain't giving him sex, but he's getting it somewhere else,  and that's why the wife says she wasn't giving him sex.  She openly admits she's not interested in sex.  What do you do in that situation?  I think I'm a higher evolved person.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  We all need sex.  My God, man.  Watson from Allentown.  I just saw the black Jay Leno on Maury.  Oh, my God.  That is terrible. 
[03:29:30]  So, she's pissed off that he's having an affair, but she's not giving it to him.  What happened first, though?  Did she stop giving him sex, and that's what caused him to go out?  She said she doesn't like having sex.  I got a side with Danny on this one.  Yeah.  Point to Danny?  Point to Danny.  One point to Danny.  All right.  My career is my thing.  I'll work day and night for it.  I'll do anything for it.  I do that for my family.  Like I said, I used to live right behind Grauman's Chinese by the dumpster,  and I won't have that happen again.  And I've talked about us being in counseling for a very long time now on the radio, 
[03:30:00]  but I never specifically talked about an affair.  And I thought, here's an act of contrition Gretchen will understand.  I'm going to put my career on the line right now.  Hello?  Honey, I'm going to have to turn down your radio.  Yeah?  What a great guy.  He's going to tell her live on his radio show.  Live on the show.  That he's having an affair.  Holy crap.  He did that?  The guy's just desperate for fame.  He really is. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah?  Apparently, you've been listening.  Yep.  Sorry.  I know this is an inappropriate time, but I didn't know.  Well, how are you?  I'm not good.  You know, I mean, I never thought that I'd be in the situation in the first place.  And secondly, I never thought that I would stand for it.  You know, but once you have kids, you can't be selfish.  You know, sometimes you have to put them first.  And, you know, that's what I did.  What a wonderful guy.  Yeah.  Do it on the air. 
[03:31:00]  Do it on the air and try to fit it in before you have to play your commercials.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  So he told his wife that he was having an affair live on his radio show.  What do you think of that, Bill?  Sort of a break of the trust between the...  You think?  Yeah.  Just a bit.  I mean, is she in on it, though?  I don't think...  You never know what this Hollywood...  Could be an act, right?  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking, too.  I'm thinking, oh, well, she's crying. 
[03:31:30]  And then I'm thinking, of course she's crying.  They can do that.  Probably an open relationship.  She was in on the threesome.  Let's go to...  Right.  Let's go to Kung Fooey from White Bag.  Weeping on the phone.  Actress.  All right.  Your voice is quiet.  No.  I haven't had sex in over four and a half years.  Five years in December.  No surprise with a name like Kung Fooey.  No, no, no, no.  Hey, Kung Fooey.  Hey, Kung Fooey.  Bang me harder.  That's just his street name.  What's the problem?  Why haven't you had sex in four years, nine months, Kung Fooey?  Women are whores. 
[03:32:00]  Well, that doesn't make sense.  Well, no, no, no.  My ex would fuck the world is what it came down to.  And I don't want diseases, the emotional baggage, all that other crap.  I've never felt so free in my life.  But what about the sex?  I have it every day, sometimes three times.  With your cats?  With myself.  That's better than a woman.  So you're just a self-sustained unit right now.  Masturbation is the key to freedom. 
[03:32:30]  Will you ever have sex again?  Yeah, I'm working on a 21-year-old right now.  But, you know, she's a slut.  And her cousin's trying to hook me up with her.  So in my workout, I don't know.  My friends think I'm gay.  I'm not gay.  Shaggy, I'm not a queer.  That's all I've got to say.  Shaggy and Kung Fooey.  You guys have been dating for five years.  That's funny.  No one was even going in that direction.  I know.  Yeah, I'm not gay.  You know what?  I think you're a little worried about that, Kung Fooey. 
[03:33:00]  Well, yeah.  All one K plan and I'm not gay.  How do you get the name Kung Fooey?  It's my first gamer tag I ever had, like, years ago.  So I stuck with it.  Why?  Did you kick somebody in the head?  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  It just came to my mind when I was hooking up DSL about ten years ago.  And that's about it.  All right.  Oh, no good.  Nothing exciting.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Maury.  Thank you, Kung Fooey.  Oh, my God.  Don't even look.  Burned.  Landed or lost. 
[03:33:30]  Shot and run over.  It's like a sleet stack.  Remember that?  How brave you are.  How courageous you are.  Yeah.  So we all fell in love.  That was it.  Oh, my God.  It's an update.  It's an update.  The sleet stacks.  All right.  Let's move on with the breaking Bonaduce.  Oh, they gave her a plastic nose.  Aw.  That's nice.  They'll snap on noses.  From the Michael Jackson collection.  They'll snap on noses look really real. 
[03:34:00]  The sleet stack.  Wow.  Jesus.  All right.  Here we go.  More breaking Bonaduce.  Do you have kids?  Do you have kids?  We have two children.  We have two.  What are you teaching them?  You know what?  I noticed even with my daughters.  This is why you're in therapy.  It's because of those kids.  You're squinting your eyes at me.  What do your eyes want to say?  That it would be, I would walk a very careful line.  With my children.  You're telling me to watch my step?  Yes, I am.  All right.  I'm going to watch my step.  Thank you.  But I'm going to tell you the same thing back.  I want you to watch your step with your children. 
[03:34:30]  Because if there's one thing that's sacred to me, it's how parents treat their children.  And what they teach their children by modeling and their behavior.  You can bang out all the cliches you wish if it'll make my wife feel better.  Cross the line with my children and we'll have difficulties.  Okay.  Oh, man.  You don't want to mess with this guy.  Crossing what line?  What did he do?  Talking about his children.  That's right.  Talking.  Talking about his children.  Isn't this a therapy session?  Yeah.  That's not a real therapist.  The second you go on fucking TV, that's like Dr. Phil.  Right, right.  You're like me.  You've got the same problem.  You know, he's trying to get laid. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he wants to be in show business.  Yeah.  That's it.  Just a scam.  He's very unlikable.  I'm guessing that you get by now.  I'm not my biggest fan.  Do you get that by now?  Yes.  Okay, good.  And you know what else I'm guessing?  I'm guessing that you really are a good father.  Thank you.  And I want you to tell me how you're a good father.  That's what I can't guess.  That's what I want to know.  You know how I'm a good father?  I teach them not to be like me.  Are you happy?  I teach them the line's bad.  I teach them the cheating's bad.  I teach them all the things I don't know. 
[03:35:30]  I didn't do a thing.  I did not do a lot right.  I'm 45 years old.  And I didn't do a lot right.  Oh, boy.  It's not that my kids are off limits.  I just taught them to be better than I.  They know better in a way because I've been deceitful.  I don't tell them I know this from experience. 
[03:36:00]  I don't tell them I know this because I am soulless.  He's acting.  Yeah, he's not a very good actor at all.  He's an addict.  Yeah.  They will be better than I for not knowing me.  Yeah, come on.  I can't stand addicts.  They fucking make everything about themselves.  Like, you're actually feeling bad.  I'm a piece of shit. 
[03:36:30]  And they're waiting.  No, no.  You're not a piece of shit.  No, I am.  I am.  Fuck you.  You are a piece of shit.  You're exactly right.  And you get no sympathy.  I love that.  Very unlikable.  What's great about these celebrity reality shows, they'll do just about anything to keep  their fame going.  Yeah.  These shows are going to just get better and better and better.  Now, yeah, you've got to top this guy now.  Yeah, you've got to top this guy.  The guy's known for what he did when he was 11, 12, 13 years old. 
[03:37:00]  And now he's 45 and trying to rekindle things.  I mean, of course.  I like him.  I think he's funny.  I saw him on Politically Incorrect one time and they had like all child stars.  Really?  And he was the only guy who was like really being open.  Honest.  Like, yeah, it sucks.  I wish I never did the show, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.  And then like Gary Coleman's trying to play it off.  Like when people are going like, you know, saying, what you talking about, Willis?  Yeah.  He tries to think if he ignores it, people are going to forget that he's on that fucking  sitcom that's still airing today. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, that'll do it.  Yeah.  Just give into it.  Go to the mall.  Make an appearance.  Sign some headshots.  Yeah.  What is it about this being a star when you're a child that just fucks them up so bad?  Because that's all they're known for.  I mean, you don't want people to think about you as being 12 your whole life.  Just imagine what you were doing at 12.  And that's all they know.  Other people are able to move on.  Yeah, but when you're famous, it's like if you fuck up your life, okay, and you're anonymous, 
[03:38:00]  the only thing you've got to worry about is some guy you went to high school with, maybe  walking in when you're flipping burgers at TGI Fridays.  But if you're famous, everybody went to high school with you.  Just like, who's the fucking, he's making burgers.  What a loser.  Oh my God.  And then they're on their cell phone.  Dude, you remember that?  What is it?  One day at a time, right?  Remember the guy who played the janitor?  Dude, he's making me a burger right fucking now.  Steve.  No, Schneider.  Fucking Schneider. 
[03:38:30]  Fucking, I mean, every fucking day.  And you just, what do you do?  You just can't leave it.  It's fucking horrendous.  Your life freezes at a certain age, and that's it.  If you were in a sitcom, that's it.  I, you know, I had...  That is brutal when you put it that way.  That's why they shave their head, they get tattoos, they try to do everything to fucking...  Yeah, they look completely different.  And when you got that courtship of Eddie's father's face where you're 60 and you still look  like you're eight running down a beach, you're fucked. 
[03:39:00]  That's funny.  You're trying to be edgy and be a peep, but let me tell you about...  They always start up like a punk band.  Yeah, they do...  You get piercings, yeah.  They do heroin.  They wouldn't have done that.  No, no.  They got to get...  They went on Alice.  ...the opposite end of the spectrum.  Alice.  Oh, God, did that kid look horrendous.  He turned...  He got older?  Yeah.  Oh, his head just kept getting longer.  Longer and longer.  Look at that John Kerry disease.  With Tom Petty teeth. 
[03:39:30]  He probably got more ass when he was 13 than when he was 17.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Well, we used to hang with Barry Williams, did the show a lot.  He would get so pissed if you called him Greg Brady.  He's just had it.  Absolutely had it with that, you know?  And we would hang after the show wherever he went.  He was still Greg Brady.  What was that show where they pushed him into the pool?  It was just a final nail.  Surreal Life?  Was it on Surreal Life or one of those?  Yeah, and he just gave into it.  He was just like...  I think at that moment, he's like, well... 
[03:40:00]  Well, Greg Brady there, Barry Williams, did the celebrity boxing.  Celebrity boxing.  Didn't he fight Danny Bonaduce?  Yeah.  He got hammered, didn't he?  Got his ass kicked.  Danny's like a martial arts guy.  And what Barry Williams, what does he know about fighting?  My lawyer was one of the guys in, uh...  What is that?  The Goonies.  Oh!  Wait, that's your lawyer too?  Chunk?  Yeah.  Yeah, because, uh...  Who the hell was talking about that?  I don't know.  I don't remember this one.  He's fucking great.  You know what I love about... 
[03:40:30]  Was it Bob?  Bob?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You know what I love about that shit?  It's like, he...  He just fucking walked...  He actually went to law school.  Yeah, wow.  Took this shit.  Did all that.  Now he's out.  He's out.  He's a lawyer.  He's fucking great at it.  He's got pictures in his office of him as...  Well, I've never seen the movie, so it doesn't freak me out.  Never saw the movie?  Yeah, my girl was just like, dude, that's Chunk.  Because I guess he...  Dude, that's Chunk.  Do you know who's representing you?  Chunk.  All right, we got more audio from Breaking Bonaduce. 
[03:41:00]  Do you know what all my friends would call going to Las Vegas without your wife?  That's a hall pass.  Nobody takes their own wife to Vegas.  I'm begging.  I'm begging you to come to Vegas.  You should be flattered.  See what I mean?  I just would be grateful and much more comfortable if you would come with me.  I just don't feel like I need to be babysitting you.  I'm afraid I won't deliver.  I'm afraid. 
[03:41:30]  This marriage is so over.  What are you guys doing?  I respect that.  Fuck you.  I have to go with you so you don't cheat on me?  Yeah.  If it's real, one of them will be dead in a week.  If one of them will kill the other one.  The marriage is so over, though.  What are they staying together for the kid or the kids?  That was a good soundtrack, though.  Yeah, the dramatic music, right?  Yeah, so he had to do a gig in Vegas.  He wanted his wife to go with him because he thought he was going to cheat, and she said,  fuck you.  Cue the haunting guitar music.  That's right.  Now you're going to go to Las Vegas, and we're thinking that she's not going to go with you. 
[03:42:00]  What do you think is going to happen?  I think this is such a giant mistake.  Tell me about that.  Well, in four days, I will not have had a drink in six months.  I'm sure you're all aware, but I take a pill called Antibus.  What that does essentially is turn alcohol to formaldehyde on contact.  If you took one in the same day as drinking, you'll definitely go to the ER.  You could die.  I switched them with aspirin three weeks ago.  They've taken an Antibus in three weeks.  They've taken bare aspirin.  So not only can I drink, I most likely won't get a headache. 
[03:42:30]  What the hell is that?  Who's he trying to trick himself?  Yeah.  Wow, you pulled him.  That he switched it with the aspirin?  Yeah, I don't.  This whole angle, I don't get.  Right.  He's tricking himself?  It's like, well, then why don't you stop doing it?  Or does she dish out the pills to him?  I'm completely aware of how fucked up I am.  Everything that I'm doing.  Well, stop doing it.  What the hell is that?  What is that about?  Are you setting yourself up for a drink?  Because this is the deal breaker in your relationship.  The way you're kind of flirting with danger.  If you get busted with your pants down somewhere other than home again, 
[03:43:00]  that, you know, we got a deal breaker.  There's part of me that says, I can do this.  I can go to Las Vegas, do my job, and come home to my family.  What is he doing?  And there's another part that says, well, if you confess your dishonesty,  you're being honest, therefore hypocritical.  Oh, no, here's the deal.  That's what's given you permission your whole life with her.  He's been drunk.  It hasn't been him.  It's been the alcohol.  So now it looks like you're sober.  If you slept with somebody, man, she's out of there,  unless she found out that you switched three weeks ago. 
[03:43:30]  How freaking clever is that, Danny?  Pretty clever.  That's really clever.  And really shitty.  Yes, Ben?  Ben ran into the studio, threw headphones on.  You're not going to believe this.  What?  Remember when Eric entered to win $100,000 from the Daily News?  Yeah.  He won.  What?  And it's not a joke.  We've just confirmed everything.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  He was in that contest that went awry in the Daily News.  Remember a while back, they had numbers, the number game,  and they put out a misprint,  and it was like thousands of people across the city had won $100,000. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  They're very angry at it.  And they said, all right, everybody that won that, send in your ticket,  we'll put it in a hat, and pick a winner,  and one of you, instead of everybody winning, one of you will win $100,000.  He won it.  He just won, and we confirmed it.  We called back.  How did you confirm it?  I called the Daily News.  I talked to the girl.  Here he is.  You just won $100,000?  $100,000.  Holy shit.  They're coming down at 12 o'clock.  They want to take photos of everybody. 
[03:44:30]  How does it feel to win as much as Opie made just doing the show?  The show today.  Damn good.  We'll have more on this tomorrow.  Bill Burr, thanks.  Jeff Norris.  Thank you.  You'll be in the Anthony Show. </pre>
