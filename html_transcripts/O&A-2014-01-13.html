<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a scathing review of the Golden Globe Awards.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, heavily criticized the awards show, focusing on Jacqueline Bissette's seemingly intoxicated acceptance speech, the questionable seating arrangements, and what they perceived as a general lack of excitement and questionable award choices, specifically citing Jennifer Lawrence's win over the actress from *12 Years a Slave* and suggesting racial bias in Hollywood.  They also shared their experiences receiving movie screeners, including receiving pamphlets instead of films, and reviewed *American Hustle* (praising Christian Bale and the soundtrack) and *August: Osage County* (finding it boring despite the cast).  A caller recounted a frustrating experience related to *The Bridges of Madison County*. The discussion continued with more criticisms of the Golden Globe winners, including crude comments about various actors and actresses, a discussion of a Jared Leto Kurt Cobain impersonation video, and further negative commentary on *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*'s win.  Jonah Hill's awkward Golden Globes presentation due to a malfunctioning teleprompter, P. Diddy's presence, and Dan Aykroyd's struggling vodka brand were also mentioned.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about miniseries, referencing *Roots*, *Bonnie and Clyde*, and *The Day After*, before returning to a detailed and comedic analysis of Jacqueline Bissette’s Golden Globes acceptance speech, focusing on her slow walk to the stage. This segued into a live, explicitly described prostate exam performed on Andrew (Big A) by Dr. Steve.  The broadcast then covered a series of anniversaries: Large Marge's death in *Pee-wee's Big Adventure*, George Bush choking on a pretzel, Bernie Goetz's sentencing, and Pete Townshend's arrest for suspected possession of indecent images of children. A significant portion was dedicated to a vulgar review of the hosts' experience at the Big Apple Circus, criticizing the acts and lack of traditional circus elements, and describing their children’s reactions. The segment concluded with a discussion of a Woody from *Toy Story* character's arrest for groping women in Times Square, the regulation of costumed characters, and the hosts’ highly offensive reaction to the auction of a black rhino hunting permit.  A short audio clip about Sam, a child with Progeria, was also mentioned.

The next segment began with a discussion of Sam Burns' death (a child with progeria previously discussed on the show), reflecting on his life and contrasting it with their own complaints.  The conversation shifted to Maury Povich's past portrayals of individuals with progeria and primordial dwarfism, followed by praise for Sam's parents.  The hosts then discussed Governor Chris Christie's response to the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal, Jay Leno's departure from the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon's new role, and Seth Meyers taking over.  The discussion extended to the controversies surrounding Woody Allen, including allegations of child molestation and reactions from his son and Mia Farrow. The mistreatment of a long-time radio engineer was also mentioned.  The show then covered the water crisis in West Virginia with caller accounts, and a significant portion was dedicated to Alex Rodriguez's steroid scandal, including Anthony Bosch's 60 Minutes interview and details of A-Rod's alleged substance use. Callers offered opinions on A-Rod's punishment and steroid use in sports. The segment concluded with further discussion of the A-Rod scandal, the hosts’ opinions on Bosch's actions and the MLB's response, and a brief mention of a film crew in the studio.

A final segment heavily featured calls about performance-enhancing drugs, testosterone, and HGH, with callers detailing both benefits and side effects, accompanied by vulgar and sexually explicit commentary.  The discussion included disparaging remarks about Queen Latifah's weight and appearance, a caller's experience with a tornado warning, a rapper changing lyrics to make a song radio-friendly, and a frightening experience with a reckless cab driver.  The hosts mentioned upcoming tour dates, and a final caller provided additional information about the dangers of steroid abuse.  Beyond the hosts, no other guests were specifically mentioned as being in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning everyone. Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Dope.  A media destination.  Look at that. Here we are.  Or something like that, right?  That's what I hear.  Golden Globes were fun last night.  Yeah, I don't know.  I kind of enjoyed it.  Entertaining to a point, you know.  Tina Fey, Amy Poehler hosting was pretty good.  I like seeing all those celebrities in one room.  But there was just no, like I was trying to live tweet some stuff, you know. 
[00:00:30]  I did too.  There was just nothing really going on.  There was no...  I was deleting a lot of tweets before I sent them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why were they too mean?  Nah, just there was...  I was forcing it, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  There was nothing really just kind of easy.  I mean, I was trying to come up with a really good Jacqueline Bissette tweet and...  Well, she was fucked up.  She was wonderful.  The hell that is.  Staring at the camera, just fucking not talking.  Well, she didn't expect to win and you see...  No, of course not.  No one does.  And the Golden Globes didn't expect her to win because they had her way up in the boonies. 
[00:01:00]  That's another thing with that fucking show.  It's not like a lot of the other award shows, which is in those giant auditoriums and they're  just kind of movie theater seats and stuff and they can go out to the aisle and then  walk to the stage.  This is like a fucking party, you know.  They got tables and they're eating and drinking, fucking, socking.  It's like being at a wedding and then you have to...  And then they got to like, they're scooching between chairs and there's always somebody  to hug and shake hands with.  Right, right.  So they play the music for whatever show or movie that they're getting an award for and 
[00:01:30]  it goes on and on and on while this person is just making his way to the stage with no  one talking.  It really is a terrible arrangement they have.  Yeah, and then Jacqueline Bissette got up there and just kind of...  She went, oh!  And just stared at the camera.  And didn't know what she was going to do or say.  No one has cared about Jacqueline Bissette for...  I know.  It could be 30 years easily.  They hit the get the fuck out of here music on her pretty quick.  And those boobies that you got to see in the deep are hurting a bit. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They look like two moray eels now.  If you saw the movie, that's a clever little joke there.  Of course, sir.  How the fuck did Jennifer Lawrence win Best Supporting Actress over the girl from 12 Years  a Slave?  It's all about who you blow.  Wow.  The Golden Globes is all just...  It's all about just sucking up.  Golden Globes is more of a white award show.  Really?  I think so.  How the fuck did she...  She was good in that?  She was great. 
[00:02:30]  But the girl in 12 Years a Slave...  I mean, that was an amazing role.  No wonder black people hate white people.  I really...  I get it.  Oh, Jimmy.  And then they win the Oscars for things they don't deserve.  Stop.  Yeah, the Oscars will be very different.  Yeah, exactly.  Watch the Oscars just sweep the shit out of 12 Years a Slave.  You think?  Yes.  That American Hustle I got to see Friday night, man.  What a great fucking movie.  I like that one.  From the comfort of my home now that I'm a voter like the rest of you guys.  Yes, we get our...  We're voters. 
[00:03:00]  For our consideration.  When do we get our ballots?  The official ballot?  I don't even care.  I want to give my ballot to a listener.  Don't.  You get fucking in trouble.  That doesn't work.  That's why I said that to me.  Jesus Christ.  How stupid am I?  I did that for the Hall of Fame.  Hall of Fame.  Deadspin or something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I said that.  I just answered literally.  Oh, literal.  You get in trouble.  Oh, really?  Do we get ballot man on his lawn shaking his fist?  I'm embarrassed.  I know.  Because someone told me last year, look at all that paper shit, and if there's anything 
[00:03:30]  you've got to send back, send that shit back so they'll keep sending you movies.  Oh.  But so far, I haven't seen anything.  I just see that envelope from...  Screen Actors Guild.  Screen Actors Guild, and you just feel that there's something in there you can't really  bend, and you know it's a movie, baby.  There's movie goodness.  And then some of these assholes just give you like a pamphlet of their movie.  Yeah, fuck that.  What am I going to do with that?  With a movie.  Give me the fucking movie.  I got the boat movie. 
[00:04:00]  They sent the boat movie, but I had seen that already.  I got the boat movie too.  American Hustle, though.  I saw that Friday night, and God damn it.  That Christian Bale is just amazing in everything he does.  He's good.  And he's completely different in everything he does.  What, did he gain a shitload of weight for that movie?  40 pounds.  40 pounds.  Yeah.  Then how do these guys lose it like it's nothing?  Well, I guess they work out and eat right.  Or go to the gym and eat better.  Go to the gym.  Eating better. 
[00:04:30]  But they gain weight like it's nothing, because they know they can just get it off themselves  easy enough.  Yeah.  But the music in American Hustle is what I really like.  Yeah, yeah.  It definitely set the tone.  They did a great job with that soundtrack.  A great job.  Yeah.  You know what some girl pointed out to me about Christian Bale in that movie?  How he's sitting there when he's talking about him being confident, and he's sitting there  with his shirt open and his big, dumb gut sticking out.  It's like the opening scene, more or less.  But he's, like, you're looking at it like this is a guy who feels good about himself and 
[00:05:00]  gets pussy.  Like, that's how great he is.  He played a fat gut.  Well, fuck the fat gut.  Yeah, yeah.  What about the shitty hair?  Yeah, the comb-over is fucking classic.  How do you get chicks with that shitty hair?  His comb-over.  Unbelievable.  He's gluing it to his head at the beginning of the movie.  Oh, my God.  Using the hairspray and fucking...  Right.  Ah, shit.  I think that Jennifer Lawrence is going to be around for a while.  Yeah.  Holy shit, she does a good job.  She's pretty good.  Did you like Amy Adams in that?  Yeah, I did.  You did?  I thought she looked good. 
[00:05:30]  She looked the part.  That deep cleavage was all right, right?  Yeah, you know, she's wearing those big fucking...  Deep cleavage dress.  Deep cleave.  She was wearing those last night.  Yeah.  The awards.  Yeah.  At the award show.  I was kind of bored with the whole award show thing, though.  Really, it was nothing, really.  But after the football games, it was just good to have on in the background, I think.  There's idiots out there.  Yeah?  You know how I do the sports curse with my picks?  I picked the four favorites over the weekend, and I was four for four. 
[00:06:00]  And then I had to point that out.  I'm like, yeah, I know.  That's why I did this.  I picked all the favorites.  Idiots, of course.  Because I was bragging.  I was four for four.  Right.  And they're like, nothing to brag about.  You picked all the favorites.  I'm like, I know.  That's why I'm bragging, you idiot.  It's not a guarantee, either.  No.  Quite frankly.  It was a guarantee.  Yeah?  Yeah, those were easy picks.  A lock?  A lock.  Was it a lock?  Absolutely.  You watch any of the football?  Nope.  You watch any of the football?  I did not, no. 
[00:06:30]  I, um...  No, I was going to watch the Broncos game, but I was like, eh, just couldn't commit to it.  I was eating dinner.  Yeah.  That was Xbox all weekend.  Call of Duty.  Yeah, some fucking...  Some people finally gave me a little clue on what to do.  With what?  With that fucking Xbox playing Call of Duty, or any first-person shooter.  What do you mean?  Can't you figure that out yourself?  No, this was kind of like a little hinty, cluey kind of thing you do.  Oh, I see. 
[00:07:00]  Your shots will always go to the center of the screen.  Regardless if you're...  What?  When you shoot your gun, your reticle's always the center of the screen.  The Star Wars?  No, when you move around and stuff, the scenery's moving.  But the reticle's always in the middle of the screen.  Right.  So, you know, it still looks first-person and stuff.  So, if you zoom in on your scope with the crosshairs, and you take like a couple of little  corners from Post-it notes, and put it right there, like little arrows pointing there, 
[00:07:30]  now when you unzoom your scope, you've still got the pieces of...  You're putting Post-its?  Post-its?  Post-its on my TV.  Post-its on your TV now?  Yeah.  So, there's Post-its in the middle of my TV, little corners of them, just points.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Like a reticle.  Right.  So, now, when you're walking around, you don't have to snap your scope up to get the crosshairs.  It's right there the whole time.  So, you could what's called hip shooting.  You could just, like, spin around and shoot now, really fast, when people come around a corner. 
[00:08:00]  Well, that doesn't seem fair.  It is fucking fair, because that's what everybody's been doing to me.  Everyone figured that out a long time ago.  Exactly.  So, I've been...  So, that's what I did.  And then I'm watching movies with crosshairs on people's fucking faces, because I didn't  want to take the shit down for...  That is pretty accurate, because when I was playing Tiger Woods golf a lot, I would measure  shit.  Yeah.  I would have the game pause, and then I would go to the TV and actually measure units.  And it was incredible how accurate that turned out to be, when I got really serious with 
[00:08:30]  that dumb game.  What else about the Golden Globes?  We really just fucking...  Yeah, it wasn't really...  Dude, I am so fucking disgusted by that decision.  It's like that...  She's a great actress.  It's a nonsense award, though.  Golden Globes don't match up with the Oscars that much.  It's a Dick Clark thing that he came up with, right?  But still, the point, though, is that an actor works hard like that, it's like, oh my god...  It's a good way to spread out the awards, you know?  And it is about just kissing the foreign press's ass.  Yeah.  Who won Best Director?  Did they have Best Director for that?  I don't know. 
[00:09:00]  I guess they do it in a film.  I don't know.  Because they gave 12 years...  Look at your list in front of you.  The guy from Gravity.  Yeah, that's what it was.  So 12 Years a Slave wins Best Movie, but none of the things that went into making it the  movie win.  The director doesn't win, the actor doesn't win, and the actress doesn't win, and the  supporting actress doesn't win.  So what made it the best picture?  Unless they just decided to throw...  But how do you not give Best Director to Gravity?  Because that was just insane how they put that thing together.  That probably should have gotten it.  But I mean, none of the major awards went to this other than Best Picture.  Storyline a little weak, but Gravity was a hell of a movie to take a look at, right? 
[00:09:30]  Well, Jimmy, with your logic, then, the movie that wins Best Picture, you should just throw  them all the other awards to it?  No, no, no.  But I'm not throwing them the awards, because Crash won Best Picture and no other awards,  and I agreed with it as Best Picture.  But when you're nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress,  and you win none of those things, to I think...  Look, I saw the movies that beat them, and they were good, but they weren't...  It's just really irritating.  I don't know why I care, but I do. 
[00:10:00]  It's just bug me.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's...  Because you know how all the shit we hate about Hollywood, it's like...  It is.  We're right to dislike it.  They're predictable.  Yeah, but this is kind of a wacky awards show.  Yeah.  It's not really a real awards show.  Oh, they're all sitting there getting hammered and soused.  Emma, Emma, Emma, what's her name there?  Kent goes up there with her fucking martini.  Who is that?  I don't know.  Emma Thompson goes up there with a martini with her shoes in her hand. 
[00:10:30]  That's not...  I know.  What the fuck is that?  She throws the shoes over her head.  Kevin Bacon's little chubby daughter there.  Hey, chubs.  Look at her.  She's fucking cute.  She was the Golden Globe girl, but she's still...  She just has to know to lay off the fucking Burger King and shit.  That's all.  She looks really good, though.  When she realizes, you know, she's got to take a couple pounds off, she's going to be ridiculously stunning.  She's actually...  She's great. 
[00:11:00]  She looked fucking fantastic.  She's probably...  I bet she's like 15 or something, though.  Really?  I bet she they dressed her up nice for the...  They gussie her up like that?  Yeah, to make her a little older.  Jesus H. Christ.  I think that's what's going on there, if you think about it.  Um...  Hmm.  Yeah, and then they always go to commercials showing them all, like, hobnobbing with each other.  Right.  That was something.  It's like...  It's like looking at you like, oh, but what's he saying to him?  I know.  What's she saying?  Why do they...  Why don't you turn on a microphone?  I want to hear what they're saying. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Oh, the fun fact on E?  Yeah.  Everyone tweeted that yesterday.  This was the fun fact on E.  Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991.  Fun fact.  They call that a fun fact on E.  I guess they got in a little jam-up for doing that.  Well, who's the idiot that let that fly?  It could be a fact.  Yes.  Just take the fun out of it.  Or how about you decide not to do that fun fact?  You could do any fun fact.  Right.  There's plenty of fun facts. 
[00:12:00]  So someone had the fun facts ahead of time and said, oh, here's Michael J. Fox on the red carpet.  It's time to put his fun fact up there.  There you go.  Why would you do that?  You know what would have been a fun fact?  Michael J. Fox didn't have Parkinson's in 1990.  That would have been a fun fact.  That would have been a fun fact.  Yes.  A lot more fun for him anyway.  Of course.  Was there other horrible fun facts or is that the only one?  Yeah, that one went around a lot.  Fun facts.  Fun facts.  Terrible.  Did they apologize?  Yeah.  We regret the insensitive classification of Michael J. Fox's Parkinson's diagnosis during our E! online live stream. 
[00:12:30]  We understand the serious nature of the disease and sincerely apologize.  You got to apologize for putting a fun fact up.  That is so stupid.  Yeah.  And then I have all those movies and then Saturday I got talked into watching August. 
[00:13:00]  Osage.  Is that how they say it?  Osage County.  It's the Meryl Streep movie.  Oh, Jesus.  About a crazy lunatic mother.  I'm like, seriously?  What?  Do you hate me right now?  Was it fun?  It was.  No.  Is that the one with all the, it's got all the people at the table?  Yes, you got the Julia Roberts, you got the Juliette Lewis, you got the, who else is in that fucking movie? 
[00:13:30]  Sam Shepard, Meryl Streep.  Sam Shepard.  The dude that was like the villain in the Muppets movie, I always forget his name, a great character actor.  You know the guy if you saw him.  Oscar the Grouch?  Is this the trailer?  The opening scene, they show Meryl Streep as a crazy mom, walking down the stairs, completely drugged out, and talking to her husband, Sam Shepard. 
[00:14:00]  And I'm looking and going, I've seen that exact same thing in real life a million times.  Oh, wow.  Sam Shepard kind of has it together, and here's his, you know.  Hit a little close to home, as they say.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Wait, would something good ever be happening that that derailed?  Like, did that ever derail something that was happening?  Oh, yeah, me and my dad would be having a good time just shooting shit about anything, and then, you know, someone needed attention because of whatever the fuck, I don't know. 
[00:14:30]  Here's the trailer, though, for August, Osage County.  Osage.  I think that's how you pronounce it, I don't know.  Stunning.  Tell me if you would see this movie.  And I have all those other movies sitting there.  I do literally say, like, out loud, when I watch a trailer on TV or something, I go, I will never watch that movie.  All right, let's see.  And I think that's one of them.  I had the slave movie.  I had the boat movie.  I had the Dallas 40-whatever-the-fuck movie. 
[00:15:00]  Dallas Buyers Club.  I have the Ofra movie, and this is the one we ended up watching on Saturday.  But I watched football all day, so I'm like, you know what, fuck it.  I'll just...  How bad could it be if it's Meryl Streep?  Hey!  They say she's a brilliant actress.  National treasure.  Let me check her out.  Let's see how brilliant this broad is.  Yeah, right.  Go ahead.  Life is very long.  T.S. Eliot.  Not the first person to say it.  Certainly not the first person to think it. 
[00:15:30]  Boy, he got old.  Yep.  Absolutely goddamn right.  Judge Keesey.  No.  No way.  Oh, God.  Hey, Mom.  I'm here.  Oh, you're so big.  Look at your boobs.  Last time I saw you, you looked like a little boy.  Instantly, right now, I hate this movie.  Thank you for your father for putting me through this.  Do you remember your Aunt Karen?  Well, that must be this year's man. 
[00:16:00]  Soon you'll be gone, never to return.  Don't start, Laura.  Father, you broke his heart when you moved away.  That is wildly unfair.  You were Beverly's favorite, you know that.  I prefer to think my parents loved their children equally.  I'm sure you prefer to think that Santa Claus brought his presents, too.  I missed Uncle Beth's funeral.  That doesn't mean anything compared to what you have in your heart.  I could.  It just looks depressing.  Douchey. 
[00:16:30]  Pardon?  You and Barb are separated, right?  Or are you divorced already?  Is there a younger woman involved?  You've said enough on this topic.  Yes.  Well, odds are against you there, babe.  That's pleasant.  In my day, families stayed together.  I do like Abigail Breslin's new big tits that she wound up inheriting.  You're supposed to be smoking?  Is anybody supposed to smoke? 
[00:17:00]  What are you doing?  Do I smell what I think I smell?  Be a father.  Help me.  Our kid is trying to deal with this madhouse you've dragged her into.  This madhouse is my home.  Wow.  Think about that statement for a second.  Marriage is hard.  That's one thing about mom and dad.  You've got to tip your hat to anybody who could stay married that long.  Karen killed himself.  Thank God we can't tell the future.  We'd never get out of it.  That looks fucking terrible. 
[00:17:30]  Such a good cast, too.  Terrible.  I don't even know what it was.  That has chick flick written all over it.  And it just has bore fest.  It's pretty dramatic.  It's a lot of dialogue because it was a play.  Depressing.  When they make plays into movies, they can't get enough of the words.  They hook up a storm.  Oh, boy, do that.  Anyway, I sat there, and the movie went on forever and ever and ever. 
[00:18:00]  And then I committed to the movie, so I'm like, all right, I've got to see what happens here.  And nothing happens in the end.  Nothing is resolved.  Did you like the trailer?  I didn't like the trailer.  And I'll say it because you can tell from the trailer, Sam Shepard kills himself.  That's why they're gone.  Oh, great.  Well, who else's funeral was it?  That's true.  The trailer kind of ruined it.  You know what I would say if that was on my TV?  Xbox go-to Call of Duty Ghosts.  Nice.  And then I'd be playing that.  I should have just went and did something else. 
[00:18:30]  It was like, I'm like, what is the purpose of this movie?  Yeah, great.  Meryl Streep's a wonderful actress, and she can play a crazy person who cares.  Who cares?  And Julia Roberts is cursing a bit more.  Julia Roberts is the daughter that doesn't take any guff.  Yep.  She's the one.  And then there's the, what, the delusional sister that thinks everything's okay?  Is that one?  Is there any of them?  That's very good.  Oh, gosh.  And then the one that's a little, you know, hasn't really figured out her life yet.  Right, right.  The young one.  That's the one that gets a man every year. 
[00:19:00]  That's Julia Lewis, who looks fucking banged up these days.  What happened to her?  She's not that old.  She's been ridden hard and put up wet over the years.  But she looks really fucking, she looks banged up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  She, um.  There's some family secrets that come out.  Oh, boy.  But does it all come together at the end where they have more of a mutual understanding of each other?  I told you, nothing is resolved in the end.  Oh, I kind of like that.  They all go away and, you know, crazy mom Meryl Streep is there, you know, in her house by herself. 
[00:19:30]  Ha ha.  Is she a hoarder?  No.  She's like a hoarder.  Just like, there's no reason to make movies like that.  No, fuck that noise.  I don't know what the reason for that movie is.  I don't know what the reason to, if that was a play, what was the reason?  Who wrote it?  I don't know.  What's his name that was in it?  T.S. Eliot?  Sam Shepard?  Sam Shepard.  He writes that shit.  He writes stuff like that?  He writes that shit.  And then they put him in movies. 
[00:20:00]  I just thought he was great as Chuck Yeager.  And he was terrific.  That's Chuck Yeager.  And the right stuff.  But Tracy Letts.  What the hell is wrong with Tracy Letts that he decided to write something like that?  He obviously has a writing talent and he decides to do that with it?  Watch him win for best...  Of course.  It'll sweep or something.  Who cares, though?  Playing AIDS wins you the awards.  We've talked about that before.  But look at McConaughey won for playing a guy with AIDS in Dallas Buyers Club.  And then Michael Douglas won for playing Liberace. 
[00:20:30]  Liberace.  Behind the Candelabra.  So out of all the great movies I get from the Screen Actors Guild, I got the worst one  out of the way.  How you sat through that.  Did you watch 12 Years Yet?  No.  I watched this and I watched American Hustle.  What a drastic difference those two movies are.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  What do you think?  I will never see that movie.  There's no reason.  Under any circumstance.  But there's no reason to see it. 
[00:21:00]  There is no reason to see that.  I got to stick up for the broads, too.  I don't understand if broads would sit through that.  There are movies, when I'm looking at On Demand, right, and I'm trying to find a movie  to watch, there are movies that pass by in the scroll, and I'm proud of myself.  I look and go, I said I'd never see that, and I haven't seen it.  And it's like a 20-year-old movie.  Right.  And I remember back then going, I won't see that.  And I'm like, God damn it, I didn't.  You're holding strong.  I fucking would not see that.  Although I did see that fucking Bridges in Madison County. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, fuck.  We got dragged to that, didn't we?  Yeah, we did.  With our exes.  Remember at one point, I had my arms folded, and I just yelled, this is bullshit.  We were getting in trouble in the movie theater with our exes.  See, if you're really in love with someone, like, yeah, I sat through that, whatever.  You know, whatever.  But you realize how much you don't like the person when they drag it to something like  that.  Can I put my film in your refrigerator? 
[00:22:00]  That movie was so god-awful bad.  Fucking bore fest.  Not believable.  A bore fest.  And I went into it with an open mind.  You were there.  It was our exes, and I swear I finally...  I'm photographing the bridges of Madison County.  Are you?  Wow.  Do you shoot someone, please?  If not, could you shoot me?  Was Meryl Streep in that one, too?  Oh, she certainly was.  Remember?  She was touching herself.  Touching herself.  Because Clint Eastwood was washing...  As old doily tits were fucking... 
[00:22:30]  Was by the well, fucking washing his body off.  Washing his baloney tits, and there's Meryl Streep getting all turned on by it.  I just yelled, this is bullshit.  But was he going down on her, and he said, your douche ain't making it.  It was that movie.  Do you even know what that movie was about?  No.  No.  Many years later, you have no idea, right?  Not Oakland.  I know he filmed the bridges. 
[00:23:00]  He was taking pictures of the bridges to Madison County.  And somehow he got into Meryl Streep's house, but I don't know why.  I don't care why anymore.  I don't even know how the movie ended, what the point was.  I think there was some infidelity going on.  I don't know.  But I think when him and Meryl Streep kind of hooked up, or did they even hook up?  I don't know.  I think that was bad because somebody had a significant other.  That's as far as I go.  I swear I have no idea.  Did a bridge burn down?  I got to go out and photograph another bridge. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm just sitting there watching.  Traffic at the GW.  That was terrible.  It really was.  I remember how mad I was in the theater.  You didn't like it?  No.  It was just, we were dragged to shit all the time.  Just dragged.  Oh my God.  Just dragged along.  I had to go to that goddamn Christmas show in Radio City Music Hall, which, I mean, look, 
[00:24:00]  if you've got kids, that's fine.  You take your kids there, you fucking, you know, they see little animals and whatever.  Right.  When you're going with the likes of your fucking cunt ex-wife, a heart-drunk mother, Annie  Marg, who was okay, but you know, how much can you fucking say to a 70-year-old woman?  She was only 70?  I have no idea.  Maybe 80.  Way older than 70.  And then I'm just sitting there like fucking jonesing for a drink while, you know, here 
[00:24:30]  are the Rockettes doing their kick line thing.  Wow.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  That's got to be exciting for, I don't know, 17 seconds, though.  No.  And then they do it for, what, an hour straight?  I remember seeing it as a kid.  It didn't change.  It was the same fucking thing.  Probably the same dancers.  It was, yeah, right.  It was terrible.  Remember they came in?  They were great.  I barely remember them.  Oh, this guy's got his beat.  Bill in Georgia.  Bill? 
[00:25:00]  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Not only did I have to, go ahead.  Yep.  I said morning.  Oh, okay.  Not only did I have to watch that stupid fucking movie, Bridges of Madison County, but my family  lives in Iowa, and when we went on vacation, we had to go to every one of the bridges.  Are you kidding me?  The bridges were more exciting than the movies.  First of all, I wouldn't even be able to have told you that that was Iowa.  No.  Winterset, Iowa is where it's going.  How many bridges could be in that one area? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, there's a lot.  Every day he was taken off to photograph another bridge.  There are many different angles.  You could shoot a bridge.  Shut up.  Like, he had to walk down into, like, the brush to get an angle.  He had to get a good shot.  And the sun had to be right.  But that scene took, I remember, like, five minutes.  It was like he was photographing everything in real time.  Oh, my God.  And then he'd get back to the fucking little cabin that, that farm thing that Meryl Streep 
[00:26:00]  was on, and they would talk at the table for a while.  Who cares?  They're dumb conversations.  Women like these type of movies?  Well, the sun was perfect when I took a shot of the covered bridge about 80 miles west of here.  I'm going to drive it again tomorrow, and you're all going to watch in real time.  Yeah, I think they even filmed the drive to the bridge.  The drive to the bridge.  Oh, was that a shitty movie.  But this asshole, he had to visit the bridges. 
[00:26:30]  This poor bastard.  And what, did you try to take the same pictures that Clint took?  Oh, look, I'm going to photograph all the bridges just like he did in the movie.  What were some of the things that were said on your road trip about the bridges?  Well, it was just a, I don't know.  I don't remember it's been several years, but John Wayne's house was in the same town, though.  That was the only cool thing.  I got to go to John Wayne's house and visit it.  Was he home?  It's like, who cares?  What made going to John Wayne's house cool? 
[00:27:00]  Compared to a bridge?  Well, he's got a point.  But, I mean, is the house still set up how John left it?  He was born there.  It wasn't in the house.  Oh, my God.  The Duke was born there.  Who cares?  That really doesn't matter.  Iowa, what do you expect?  That really doesn't matter.  I think the only houses where maybe a president was born, that would be like, oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But besides that, I can't imagine going to a house where somebody was born. 
[00:27:30]  Well, the distinguishing thing that they talked about was the architecture.  The corner of the house, you know, where it comes to a 90-degree corner,  they had 45, and that's where the door was,  and it made the house distinctive because the door was in the corner.  Oh, God.  Shit.  What a dull fucking trip.  Did you go to a Friday's after this to really hammer your day home?  No, we went to a little mom-and-pop place and had tenderloins.  Oh, that's great.  Could we look at a little of the trailer for Bridges of Madison County? 
[00:28:00]  Because I need to remember what...  What year is this?  I need to remember what this was about.  You're serious.  Just until I just get an inkling.  All right.  Go ahead.  What year was this movie, by the way?  We were in Boston, so we were in Boston 95, 98.  95, 96.  96, I'm going to guess, maybe.  So how many years ago?  That's 18 years ago.  Jesus.  Give or take a year.  Yeah.  Oh, already, I'm bored.  Oh, the wheat. 
[00:28:30]  There are images that lie within my heart.  What the fuck?  This is lovely.  They haven't shown anything yet.  With the power to recall the warmth of a summer's night.  The stillness before a storm.  Reminding me of the first time I ever saw him.  Oh.  When he stopped and asked directions to Rosamund Bridge. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, that's right.  You have an accent.  A moment when there was nowhere else to go.  What?  Except towards love.  Tomorrow.  Warner Brothers presents  The most passionately read love story of our time.  Clint Eastwood.  Ugh.  Meryl Streep.  And a bridge. 
[00:29:30]  And a bridge.  Of Madison County.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  The trailer itself just reeks of boredom.  That was terrible.  I don't even know what they showed in the trailer.  The fuck is that?  It didn't make you feel romantic in the clothes?  Oh, fuck no.  Oh, my God.  I remember, though.  Fucking clearly.  He was more romantic in Kelly's Heroes.  He's a soldier.  Kelly's Heroes is one of the classics. 
[00:30:00]  Stealing Nazi gold was great.  When I first saw him.  When he first walked to my door.  Could I take a dump?  And they show her watching him shit through the keyhole while she's fucking herself with  the thing that churns the butter?  He's fucking veins in his head as he strains. 
[00:30:30]  He's been holding it in, taking a bunch of bridge pics.  He's reading the paper.  He's got one leg sticking straight out.  Goddamn piles.  He's sweating like a pig.  Yes.  You remember, right?  You remember being in that theater.  Dude, I certainly do.  I think to anyone out there, if you're not sure about your relationship, and this is real  shit, go to one of these type of movies and see what happens, what kind of feelings you 
[00:31:00]  have, and the feelings you have will be completely on the same level as what you think of your  woman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Because if you're really in love, you'll sit through one of these every once in a while  and be like, ah, what are you going to do?  Yeah, she's enjoying it.  You know, what are you going to do?  I make the sacrifices because I care about her.  But if you're like us, with your arms folded, yelling, this is bullshit, I think there might  be problems in the relationship. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Especially when you're in the theater, and you hear through the wall next door.  It's just like great fucking action going on.  The walls are shaking.  The walls are shaking.  You could feel it in your scene. 
[00:32:00]  And then your movie, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  Can I use one of your closets as a dark room?  Oh, my God.  I have to get some 800-speed film here.  I got to reload my camera so it's raining outside.  Next door.  That's right.  Oh, God.  It's just fucking, what a chore, just sitting there.  I just don't believe that women want to see those type of movies over and over again.  I know.  I just don't believe it. 
[00:32:30]  Awful.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  Would you have gone with a flash?  What?  Yeah.  Let me talk to you about aperture settings.  Next door.  Fucking.  Yeah.  Fucking great.  So that's it for the Golden Globes.  Ah, yes.  We were talking about the Golden Globes. 
[00:33:00]  Best movie picture.  12 Years a Slave.  I got to watch that damn thing.  Best actress in a motion picture drama.  Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine.  I saw part of that one.  I liked it.  I forgot why.  I think, I don't remember why.  Was she better than Sandra Bullock?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Cate Blanchett is a national treasure.  My God.  Another national treasure.  She's amazing at everything she does.  We have so many national treasures. 
[00:33:30]  We sure do.  Thank goodness.  Who else is a national treasure?  They're saying Tom Hanks is a national treasure now.  Yes, I heard that.  He's made it to the national treasure.  Who called him that?  Was it Matt Damon?  It might have been Matt Damon, yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Names are Leo DiCaprio.  Leo DiCaprio is a very good actor, but he plays the same guy in all his movies.  And then they still give him awards.  When it works, it works.  He really is the same fucking character a lot. 
[00:34:00]  He's not a national treasure.  Bob Dylan's a national treasure.  Oh, no.  We don't think...  Leo DiCaprio?  I'll say national treasure.  No, you've got to be around.  Oh, okay.  Keith sees him a lot.  Keith the cop sees him a lot when he does security stuff.  Yeah.  And he's always out at these certain bars with his buddies and stuff and just hanging out,  regular guy.  No one fucks with him.  He doesn't fuck with anybody.  Right.  So he apparently is able to still lead, like, some kind of a life.  That's cool.  So I guess once you're a national treasure, you don't have your life anymore, right? 
[00:34:30]  No, no.  Tom Cruise, national treasure?  Yeah.  Yeah, Tom Cruise.  National treasure?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Undeservedly so.  DiCaprio won for the Wolf of Wall Street, a movie everyone is talking about.  I've got to see this fucking thing.  Yeah.  Best actor in a motion picture, musical, or comedy.  It looks very expensive, that movie.  To me?  The look of that movie just has Scorsese written all over it.  Yeah.  And a lot of fucks in that movie, huh?  A lot of fucks, but it's not like...  It doesn't get in the way. 
[00:35:00]  It's very natural, normal guys in a fucking room talking fucks.  Our world is fucked up.  That movie is going to do extremely well.  Yeah.  Most people are going to go to the movie theater and see it, and it sets the record for fucks.  And then you'll go home and turn on the TV, and if someone slips and says fuck,  you're going to write a letter immediately.  Yeah.  It makes no sense.  Stupid.  That is stupid.  So Cate Blanchett won for Blue Jasmine, our national treasure.  She beat out the Dame Judi Dench. 
[00:35:30]  Dom Judi Dench.  Let's see.  Best actor in a motion picture drama.  But what's the difference between best actor in a motion picture drama and best actor in a motion picture musical or comedy?  So they split it up so they could give more awards out, I guess.  Oh, how stupid is that?  I think that's what it is.  So best actor in a motion picture drama.  Yes, Sam.  What?  Then they classified American Hustle and Wolf of Wall Street and movies like that as comedy.  As comedy musical.  And they're not comedies or musicals.  There's some funny lines in American Hustle. 
[00:36:00]  Funny lines, but it's not a...  You can be funny with that.  I mean, there's funny lines in Goodfellas.  It's not comedy.  Louis C.K. in there.  And in American Hustle, they didn't fire one gun, right?  No, I don't think so.  That type of movie, you would think there might have been a couple gunshots.  Yeah.  It was kind of cool right in it, in a way, right?  Yeah.  And how badass was De Niro as the mob boss?  Oh, he was good in that as the mob guy.  He was in the movie for what?  Maybe ten minutes?  No, not even.  It's probably five minutes.  You do get the impression that he would absolutely kill you, yeah, or have you killed. 
[00:36:30]  Holy fuck was that good.  The tension at the table between him and him was a great scene.  And it's like, uh-oh, they're totally fucked.  Right.  Yeah, that's a good one.  It was good to see De Niro switching it up.  Jesus.  I'm surprised he didn't play a cop.  So best actor in motion picture drama was Matthew McConaughey.  Incidentally, a terrible decision.  Dallas Buyers Club.  Beating out.  Who should have won that, Jimmy?  And I hate to keep harping it.  I forget.  I don't know how to say his name.  Chueto, whatever his name is.  12 Years a Slave. 
[00:37:00]  Naga, Naga, Naga be here anyway.  McConaughey was good.  He was really good.  But it wasn't like a whole lot.  Like, you know when an actor goes emotionally up and down all over the place?  It's like, it's hard to do from what they tell me.  It was just a different level of acting.  And it's like, ugh, fucking.  Whatever.  It is what it is.  It's not my business.  It's not my business.  Best motion picture comedy or musical, American Hustle was the winner there.  Best actress in a motion picture, musical or comedy, Amy Adams won. 
[00:37:30]  DiCaprio, let's see what else.  Supporting actors and actresses who gives a fuck.  Although Jared Leto came out of nowhere.  He hasn't been in Hollywood in six years.  Looked like a closet to me.  Who was fucking Sam Donaldson's son that he was fucking hugging?  See the eyebrows on that guy?  Mr. Spock?  No, I missed all that.  The guy next to him.  In the audience?  Yeah, like while they were sitting at the table together.  And then when he won, they stood up.  And then this guy, he's like kissing him and fucking hugging him and shit. 
[00:38:00]  Is Jared Leto, um, is he a gay gentleman?  I don't think so.  Jesus Christ.  He looks like Jesus Christ.  You see him as the kids that played a transsexual in, um, he was 116 pounds when he did this movie.  Wow.  Wave-like.  Yeah, he was really, really good.  But he's really short.  We met him down in, uh, West Palm Beach.  He was part of that whole thing we did.  Oh, that's right.  He is a little guy.  And, uh, that band of his, he thought was a little goofy side project, took off. 
[00:38:30]  And he had to take six years off from Hollywood.  And he comes back and he wins something right away.  This is his first movie in six years?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you see him play Kurt Cobain in that video?  Holy fuck.  No.  You guys aren't really a Kurt Cobain fan, so, are you?  Well, yeah.  It's pretty fucking creepy how close he gets to, uh, yeah, look at this.  What video?  Look at this.  Yeah, Sam's got it.  It's one of his, um.  Look, he's got the hair like Kurt.  Isn't that creepy?  That's him? 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  That's Jared Leto.  And then he almost pulls off the voice, too.  That is, uh, that looks, really.  I think he did this because he really wants to play Kurt Cobain badly.  Yeah, they're blurring.  Oh, he just did this?  I believe.  We've got to look up the story.  He's got it right there, big time. 
[00:39:30]  I'm a liar and a thief.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Not bad, right?  And he's got the look down, too.  Sit and drink, penny royalty.  Are these the accurate lyrics? 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, when he screams penny royalty, it's, like, perfect.  I'm a penny royalty.  Why doesn't, uh, Jared Leto get, like, any real respect?  People were surprised when he won last night because he doesn't get any respect.  Who doesn't?  Jared Leto.  You don't think?  I don't think.  They laugh at his band, you know, kind of like, you know, oh, what is this, Dogstar 2? 
[00:40:30]  But, I mean, he's obviously talented.  He's a great actor, man.  Travis, jump in there.  His band proved everyone wrong, though, man.  Yeah, I mean.  That band has a huge fan base.  They've been very successful for a long time.  Yeah, but it started out, you were right, to, like, what is Leto doing?  Yeah.  But that's a while ago now, man.  He filmed that, like, years ago.  What broke him?  Like, what made him, uh...  My So-Called Life.  Okay, that was why.  Jordan Catalano.  All right.  Now that's why he's got no respect.  That name of her dream was amazing.  Yeah, well, Claire Danes was in So-Called Life, and she's, you know, taken completely seriously. 
[00:41:00]  What do you know about that video, though?  He did it a long, not a long time ago, but years ago when he heard that they were considering making a movie about Kurt.  Kurt, so he says that he filmed it just to explore the character, and he never sent it to a studio or anything.  And then he released it years later on one of the anniversaries of Kurt's death, I think, last year.  Not bad, though, huh?  Pretty good.  And then, uh, moving to the TV categories for the Golden Globes. 
[00:41:30]  Although, do you want to know what won Best Original Song, or...?  Um, no.  You sure?  Positive.  Positive?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Okay.  Uh, Best TV Series Drama, Breaking Bad.  Oh, yeah.  We all saw that coming.  Uh, then, uh, Best Actress was Robin Wright, House of Cards.  Best Actor, Bryan Cranston for Breaking Bad.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Best TV Series, Musical or Comedy. 
[00:42:00]  This is a brand new fucking show.  That came out of nowhere.  Andy Samberg.  And Andy Samberg won the award for actor, too.  Right.  Yeah, that's what happened.  I've seen, well, I haven't seen, I'm going to start watching it again, because I might  be missing something, but I watched it the first couple episodes.  It's not good.  What was it up against?  Um, ah, dumb shows.  What was he up against?  Well, I mean, like, Big Bang Theory, they usually give it to.  I hate that show, but they usually give it to it.  That shouldn't get an award. 
[00:42:30]  Ever.  For anything, ever.  It's, people still love that dumb fucking show.  I don't understand.  Uh, it beat out Big Bang Theory, Girls, Modern Family, Parks and Rec.  Yeah.  Parks and Rec is a much better show than Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  Even Girls, you know, whatever.  And, and Modern Family's better, too.  And then what about actor?  Like, who did he beat out personally for him?  Ah, just.  Peoples?  Yeah.  Peoples?  No names like, uh, Don Cheadle.  He beat out Don Cheadle?  Yeah.  What kind of shenanigans is going on? 
[00:43:00]  That's a fix, right?  There's a fix because.  He might have had to blow some people because this doesn't make sense.  Somebody must be invested in the Andy Samberg business.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone's in the Andy Samberg business.  Andy Samberg beat out Jason Bateman for Arrested Development.  Come on.  You know, that's a show.  This is ridiculous.  Don Cheadle for House of Lies.  Uh, not to be confused with House of Cars.  All right.  I didn't know that.  It's a House of Something.  Both are very good shows, apparently.  Uh, Michael J. Fox for the Michael J. Fox show.  I got a fun fact about him. 
[00:43:30]  What?  In 91, he got Parkinson's.  There was another fun fact, too.  Yeah?  Why?  Uh, someone reminded me on the Twitter.  Thank you.  Uh, they did a James Gandolfini fun fact.  Fun fact?  That he died.  Oh, Jesus.  Was that a real one?  No way.  I thought it was a joke.  I just read that.  It has to be a joke.  Yeah, there were a whole bunch of joke ones.  No, that's a real one.  Oh.  I read it on Twitter.  It has to be real.  It's got to be real.  They wouldn't lie.  I'm heating up.  Is that really a fake one?  It's got to be.  Is that what a fake one?  Dude, I just read it.  I just got caught bad.  They would have been in apology mode for that, too.  I'm guessing just because they didn't know it. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, bravo to whoever just got me.  And Jim Parsons for the Big Bang Theory.  Which one is he on the Big Bang Theory?  He's the really famous one.  I don't know him.  Which one is he?  No idea.  You know if he's the awkward.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  Everybody knows him.  He's very, very famous.  Is he gay in real life?  Yes.  Wow.  You can never tell from the show.  I'm proud to say I've never seen a Big Bang Theory all the way through.  I've seen it.  It's been on the TV. 
[00:44:30]  It's been on the TV and I've stopped and went, nah, and then moved on.  Here's how I've watched it.  In a tiny little picture in picture, as the guide is on, flipping through, because Seinfeld  just ended.  Oh, I see.  And I'm flipping through the guide now, so I hear some of the hilarious science geek jokes  until I can find anything to change the channel to.  It's the same way I feel now when it's, same today.  All you see is violence in movies. 
[00:45:00]  Get me the fuck off of this.  You're done with that show?  Yes.  Why?  No, that reminds me of the time.  That's like that one time I.  All right.  Good.  Good.  All right.  Someone's being a dick on Twitter, but it made me laugh.  Oh, really?  He goes, a bunch of fucking wash women talking about movies.  Hey, Aunt Jim Norton and Aunt Obie Radio, let's move it along.  Move it along.  Fuck off.  I could talk about how awful the Bridges of Madison County are. 
[00:45:30]  Oh.  I could talk about that every day.  No problem.  Absolutely.  No fucking problem.  It just, it stirs up emotions in me.  Did you guys see the P. Diddy at this thing?  Why was the P. Diddy at the Golden Globes?  Because he's actor-producer.  Of what?  Mogul.  Of what?  Well, he was just presenting this time.  Yeah.  And he's shucking it up.  He's like trying to get hugs from Bono.  Bono's like, get the fuck away from me.  Yeah.  Well, P. Diddy was in his inimitable fashion of trying to take over what's going on or just 
[00:46:00]  add himself to him.  It really seemed like what he did with Biggie.  Like when the guy came out to do his speech, he had to jump in.  Jump right in.  How much longer do we have to deal with Diddy as a personality?  Diddy's forever now.  I mean, Diddy's not going anywhere.  Is he a national treasure?  I would consider Sean Combs a national treasure.  Ah, shut up.  He stinks.  He stinks.  Diddy stinks.  He comes.  What the hell has he done lately?  What was the last thing he did of significance?  Right. 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  I guess he's a businessman now.  Didn't he have a rap reality show or something?  That was Search.  I don't know.  Search.  Search.  Search is like, isn't that the last big, that's his, right?  Search.  Search, yeah.  Isn't that the last big thing?  Oh, Holmes?  What was that?  I thought you meant Search.  Search Holmes.  What is Search?  Search's his vodka.  Oh, the vodka thing.  Sure.  He's always pushing his Search. 
[00:47:00]  Shit.  I heard Dan Aykroyd's vodka isn't doing too well.  Really?  There's still a skull.  It's good stuff, and everyone loves that skull.  You know what the problem with that vodka is?  I think their finances are a little fucked up.  Oh, they're in trouble, huh?  Once you buy a bottle and have the skull, there's no reason to get another skull.  Then you buy Grey Goose.  Then you just go to Grey Goose.  Is it good vodka, though?  Does anybody drink it?  It's good vodka, but you know what?  Grey Goose is good.  That's brilliant.  Why would you keep buying the skulls?  Yeah.  So why wouldn't they have the same vodka in a cheaper bottle? 
[00:47:30]  Right.  And basically promote it as, look, you get this, and then what you do is you put this  in your skull.  Refill your skull.  You're absolutely right.  You don't want a whole house full of fucking...  A house full of crystal skulls.  You look like a fucking...  Idiot after a while.  ...evil genius.  But is it more expensive because of the bottle?  Because otherwise you just throw them out like they were sitting in the bottle.  I bet it is.  Yeah.  It's way more expensive.  I mean, that's why.  Yeah, I bet it is.  And no one throws the bottle out.  So the numbers don't work out after a while because you'll step up to get the crystal skull 
[00:48:00]  once.  You put yourself out of business with that goddamn bottle.  Wow.  You know what?  Hey, and can we talk about Jonah Hill, a guy who used to do our radio show until he became  a serious actor.  Uh-huh.  He doesn't want anything to do with us.  He's blown us off for at least three movies now, and a lot of big ones.  Yeah, of course.  And he apologized to me personally on Twitter that it was an oversight, and now I'm starting  to think it's not an oversight whatsoever.  Why?  Was he here again recently? 
[00:48:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  But he's in this Wolf of Wall Street, and then he had to go up and talk about Wolf of  Wall Street, and the teleprompter, thank you, wasn't working.  And so he didn't know how to talk about his own movie.  No.  Did you see this clip?  Yeah, he came out with that hot chick.  Right.  And then completely panicked.  And they were like, uh-oh, this is the teleprompter stuff for the next people that are coming  up.  Uh-oh, we don't have anything.  And then someone handed him a piece of yellow legal pad paper with some shit written on it. 
[00:49:00]  Aren't you a comedian?  Can't you just fuck around a little bit up there?  You would think if it's your movie.  And you're a comedian.  You could riff on it a little.  Right.  I haven't seen the movie.  Was that done on purpose to tie in with their movie?  Not at all.  Oh, God, no.  Okay.  Yeah, play this.  Oh, boy.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Right now, they put up the wrong stuff on the teleprompter.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  This is for Aaron Eckhart and Paula Patton.  And I've never done this before, so I don't want to improvise.  Don't you worry.  Okay.  You don't have to worry about a thing.  They hand her a piece of paper.  Cool.  Let's just be real about it.  That was not for us.  Maybe it was a joke that they do on, like, rookies like me, like, for the first time.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The first nominee for best motion picture comedy examines how the American dream can lead 
[00:50:00]  to corporate greed.  Money, power, women, drugs.  Temptations were there for the taking, and more was never enough.  This is the Wolf of Wall Street.  It's got to be amazing the first time you take her clothes off, huh?  Yeah.  What's her name?  She's lovely.  You just take her clothes off.  She's new to Hollywood.  Just standing there naked, and you're just like, this is fucking, that is amazing.  Hollywood's going to eat her alive.  Oh, I only hope.  She's new.  I only hope it spits her out the other side, bruised and battered. 
[00:50:30]  Sure.  I'm sure Jack Nicholson's already rubbing his penis on her behind, and she's just trying  to get a cocktail.  She's eating his ass in an elevator already.  Yeah.  You want to get fired in the business, honey?  Oh, no.  He's going to deal with all those fucking idiots.  Yeah.  She's gorgeous, man.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  But there's Jonah Hill, like, reading.  There you go.  Money, greed, power, what?  Money, greed.  Do you know what your movie's about?  How about you just say, hey, you know, I was in this movie. 
[00:51:00]  And then let's do the Jacqueline Bissette thing.  That was kind of fun.  Jacqueline Bissette.  What did she win?  Why not?  Was it an achievement, a lifetime achievement type thing?  No, you would think.  But she just, uh, had a...  Best, uh...  Artist of the Millennium?  No?  Actress in a miniseries, I think.  What?  They're supporting it.  Why is that an award?  Actress in a miniseries?  Actress in a miniseries?  For two weeks, big deal.  Why do they do miniseries still?  Anymore? 
[00:51:30]  Who cares?  Series, miniseries.  After Roots, who cared?  Or television film.  Series, miniseries.  What?  Actually, I did like The Day After.  That was a good one.  Good miniseries.  Was that a miniseries or was it just a movie?  Was that just a movie?  I thought it was a two-nighter.  I think you're right.  It was The Day After Tomorrow is a movie, I think.  Right.  And then The Day After was the nuclear war one with Jason Robards.  But a miniseries, what, it has to be two days in a row at least.  I think it's two.  How's the miniseries?  Bonnie and Clyde was a miniseries.  The Blue and the Gray?  The Day After. 
[00:52:00]  The Bastard.  Remember The Bastard?  No.  There was a show, a miniseries on called The Bastard.  Yeah.  And it was in a time where, like, you didn't hear any curses whatsoever on television.  And this ad would come on.  It's like, and this fall, The Bastard.  And we'd laugh our asses off as kids.  It's like, oh, The Bastard?  We've got to find that.  Yes, The Bastard.  It was very fun to hear.  They have all the Netflix shows.  And I think American Horror Story, because it's a different thing every season. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Are also in the miniseries.  Miniseries?  The miniseries has passed us by.  Yeah.  It doesn't need its own category anymore.  Remember Roots?  Everybody watch that.  Let's do the Jacqueline Bissette thing.  I taped it and watched it back.  I get it.  I get it.  Yeah.  And the Golden Globe goes to...  We're going to include her walk to the stage as well.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is she doing?  She took her sweet ass time.  Jacqueline Bissette, dancing on the edge.  Oh, God. 
[00:53:00]  Thank God.  First, she sits there for a while.  It's like, get your ass up.  There's a long walk to the stage.  Commercials are coming.  This is the first win and fifth nomination for Jacqueline Bissette.  Get up.  Get up.  Golden Globe tonight for her role.  No one has seen her in years.  And look where they sat her.  Wow.  Look how far away she is.  Oh, my God.  She had a fucking balcony?  Yeah, because it's Jacqueline Bissette.  No one has thought of her in a long time.  So they gave her a seat way in the back.  Now she's got to walk all the way to the front. 
[00:53:30]  She's going downstairs.  She's taking an elevator.  She looks fucking loaded.  Yeah, she's loaded.  Is she?  She has to be.  Oh, yeah.  You haven't seen this yet?  No.  Oh, God.  It's great TV.  Stopping along the way.  Say hi to John Voight.  Ah, John Voight.  Nice long walk.  Yeah.  She's horrible.  Everybody's talking at me.  And then she.  I don't need a word to say in.  And then she walks backstage and comes.  John Voight's car.  What a dope.  She went the wrong way.  And now she's coming from the. 
[00:54:00]  Where is she gone?  This looks like a Keystone Cops chase sequence.  What the fuck?  Is that a real time?  It seemed like it was a lot longer last night when I saw that.  That was real time.  Okay.  Now watch what this dummy does.  God.  Oh, boy.  One award for a miniseries.  Relax.  Like smattering.  Calm down.  Yeah.  What was the competition? 
[00:54:30]  47 years ago for the Hollywood foreign press gave me a promising, a nomination for the Hollywood, a promising newcomer.  Wow, are you fucking drunk?  Thank you very much, Hollywood foreign press.  I'm absolutely shaking.  I can't believe this.  God knows.  You've nominated me about five times.  I think this.  Anyway.  Can you pause this for a second?  It's fucking funny. 
[00:55:00]  Let me, let me explain what she just won.  This is not going to be complimentary, I sense it.  That's a supporting actress in a series, miniseries, or TV movie.  Uh-huh.  Jacqueline Bissette for Dancing on the Edge.  Okay.  Does anyone know what that was?  It was about a girl who lives by a curb and refuses to go on the street to dance.  Boo, Jim.  Boo.  Some broad for the White Queen.  Does anyone know what that is? 
[00:55:30]  No.  A miniseries called Nashville.  Nashville's a big series.  No, it's not.  Well, it is.  Yeah.  Who's in it?  What's your face from Heroes?  Hayden Planetary.  Hayden Planetarium.  Mmm.  And then a couple you do know, Parenthood and Modern Family.  Uh-huh.  So back to this.  So she won.  And she's making it sound like a fucking, yeah, a Vanguard award at the Oscars. 
[00:56:00]  Okay.  Scottish background to the front.  Okay.  Oh, is she fucking sauced?  Um, I was wanting to do something for the BBC.  Ooh.  She likes the BBC, don't she?  Good girl.  This is the second award of the night, so it's not like she'd been drinking all night.  This happened at 8.15.  The show started at 8.  What do you think? 
[00:56:30]  Nobody has a belt before they get there?  Yeah, right?  Sam is so naive.  A little pre-game.  They're all pre-game.  Lady Di's hammered right now.  And it's fucking...  Exactly.  Natty Ice is.  Natty Ice.  Yeah.  This is, uh, yeah, the Golden Globes.  You let your hair down a little bit.  You didn't see Jacqueline Bissette in the limo when she had the fucking, the hat on with  the two beers in it and one straw?  Classless pig.  Okay.  What are you trying to say? 
[00:57:00]  I always wanted to do something for the BBC.  All right.  And we did this, and this was great.  Chiwetel, where are you?  Can I see Chiwetel?  I need him for inspiration.  Where is he?  Inspiration?  Okay.  BBC.  Yes.  She's a BBC, a big, boring country.  Class, thank you for putting this on.  And, um, thank you to my British agent, uh, Steve Kennis.  James Bond?  And my American agent, Harry Abrams. 
[00:57:30]  I, I'm sorry, I'm going to get this together.  Get the fuck out of here, music.  People have given me joy.  Jesus.  And there have been many.  You can't, you can't say, it's my pride and joy, Jerry, you keep that.  Oh my God.  You can't say, I'm going to get this together as, as the walk-off music starts.  You're falling apart.  Right.  Yeah, they get the fuck off the stage, music's playing.  And now you're going to say, I'm going to get this together.  Yeah.  You missed the failed dump out.  Oh, right.  I said shit.  Oh, okay. 
[00:58:00]  Harry Abrams.  I, I'm sorry, I'm going to get this together.  I want to thank the people who have given me joy.  And there have been many.  Shit.  They cut everything but shit.  I said, like, my mother.  What did she say?  She used to say, go to hell and don't come back.  Damn, that's quiet.  Fuck yeah.  That's a good one.  They're trying to get her off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're saying, shut up.  However, however, my mother was not entirely me. 
[00:58:30]  I, I believe, if you want to look good.  Now they're playing like disco music, hoping she dances off the stage.  Think she's back at Studio 54.  The best duty treatment.  Forgiveness for yourself and for the others.  Shut your face.  I love my friends.  I love my family.  And you're so kind.  Thank you so much.  She should have closed on a big laugh.  They would get her on a front break.  She could have had a nine and a half.  She could have fucking left.  All right, well.  Wow, that was fucking painful to watch, huh? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Golden Globes.  There you go.  She didn't look like she was completely there.  No.  I think she was tipping a few.  Perhaps.  A little bit, a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  Perhaps.  All right, we got some A-Rod audio for everybody.  Oh.  We got some new Christy shit.  And what else?  Hmm.  Oh, yeah, that thing.  Thing?  Yeah, that thing.  Cool.  Mm-hmm.  But first, we're going to eat.  Yes, let's do it.  Opie and Anthony have been creating broadcasting magic for 20 years. 
[00:59:30]  Doug from the O&A Vaults.  This is a 20th anniversary O&A radio gem.  We got Big A in the corner with Dr. Steve.  And Big A's going to get his prostate exam.  Are you nervous, Andrew?  How do you feel?  Let's talk to Ants Mike.  Tell me to Ants Mike.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am a little nervous.  All right, well, that's part of...  I'm sorry, I got it, Andrew.  What did you say?  Actually, I am a little nervous.  Yes?  Yeah.  Why?  What's going on?  You can pull the mic towards you a little bit.  What's making you nervous? 
[01:00:00]  Um, I'll have a finger up your ass, maybe.  Well said.  All right, yeah.  Not a bright question.  All right, Big A, you ready?  Your gum.  Put the gum out.  Put the gum out, Tom.  We'd hate to have Steve pull it out of his finger.  So what we'll be looking for is enlargement of the prostate,  and we've also got a card here for testing to see if there's any blood.  And his rear end, so a pretty common procedure that is done usually when you start to hit middle age 
[01:00:30]  or if you have symptoms.  And it's a simple procedure.  It's relatively painless and just a little bit of discomfort.  What's the thing that you do to test for blood?  Shouldn't that just be you use a white glove?  Well, okay, that's an excellent question, Jim.  Yeah.  Actually, you can detect microscopic amounts of blood using this card because you can...  So how does it work?  There's a chemical in there that reacts to hemoglobin.  When we put the developer on there, it'll turn blue. 
[01:01:00]  And you can detect just a few red blood cells, which you would not be able to see,  so you can catch it before.  I mean, if you've got bright red blood pouring out of your ass, then, I mean, you know you've got a problem.  This is a way to catch it before it becomes a huge thing.  So he swipes with that little card?  Yeah.  Kind of like a purchase in a store.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I picked the worst time to start eating my blueberries.  I may find a few of those myself.  Yeah.  Okay, are you ready? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, here we go.  What you've got to do is drop your drawers, and then I need you to...  I want a big cheer when Big A drops his drawers, you know.  You don't need to say that.  We're all going to do it instinctively.  Yeah.  That's right.  Drop it.  Atta boy.  You dropped those pants.  All right.  Yeah.  And now, yeah, they've got to go down, too.  The underwear's got to come down, sweetie.  Yeah.  And bend over the...  Bend over.  Hold on.  We've got to get the mic by Big A's mouth.  There you go.  There's my finger. 
[01:02:00]  And...  Big A!  All right.  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  Hello.  I'm Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear the train coming.  It's rolling around the bend. 
[01:02:30]  And I haven't seen the sunshine since...  Yeah.  I don't know when...  You like this one, right?  Yeah.  It's a classic, you know.  And time keeps dragging on.  Well, this is 46 years old.  Wow.  The live album at Folsom Prison.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We talk about this.  You don't see musicians going to prison anymore to perform.  No, they don't.  They kind of frown upon that now.  Yeah.  I'm sure there were a lot of people 46 years ago that really wanted to see Johnny Cash 
[01:03:00]  but never had the opportunity.  Right.  And then he goes to a prison to perform for prisoners.  Uh-huh.  Convicts, right?  What is that?  40...  Convicts voice.  46 years?  Yeah.  That's what?  That would be 1970.  Yeah, 67.  67?  I'm 45.  46?  No.  68.  Jesus, what's wrong with us?  1968.  I found an anniversary over the weekend.  One one jumped out at me while I was watching a movie. 
[01:03:30]  What was that?  Well, I was watching Pee-wee's Big Adventure.  Oh, I saw you tweet that.  And as I noticed the plaque on the wall commemorating the life and death of Large Marge,  I noticed that it was exactly 40 years to the day of me watching that Saturday night, January  11th, that Large Marge on a night just like this night, died in that horrible crash of 
[01:04:00]  her truck.  So it was, yeah, January 11th, 1974.  That's a good find right there.  I'm like, fuck, wait, I was like, what's the date?  It's January 11th, 2014.  It's 40 years.  Large Marge.  You should have sent that to BuzzFeed.  They would have loved that one.  Oh, would they ever, right?  They love things like that on BuzzFeed.  That's a good one.  Well, I just posted it on Twitter and went back to the movie.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Tell them Large Marge sent you.  That always reminds me of a lady trucker. 
[01:04:30]  Again, only more attractive.  A couple more anniversaries, would you like to hear them?  Large Marge, that is.  Yes, please.  George Bush fainted after choking on a pretzel.  That was 12 years ago already.  Remember that one?  Seems like that should be longer, actually.  I thought that was longer.  Sometimes you get that little relief, like, oh, I thought that was longer.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  And then you got the, uh, you got the Bernie Getz sentenced to a year, 25 years ago.  Weapons charge.  That's all they got them on.  Shooting those poor innocent kids on the subway. 
[01:05:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then finally, uh, this was a doozy, but he got out of it.  Pete Townsend arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children 11 years ago.  That means they saw, they found this shit on his computer and he skated 11 years ago.  Did they find images, though?  Or was it because he was trying to show him?  Possessing indecent images of children.  That means he has them in his possession.  Wait, you said suspicion.  You said he joined with a credit card and was trying to prove that you can join these sites with a credit card. 
[01:05:30]  I guess that suspicion word is very important.  Yes, it is.  Pete Townsend was arrested on suspicion, you're right, of possessing indecent images of children 11 years ago.  So what's the difference there?  I mean, I know what the difference is, but what do they say?  Well, technically.  Well, I think that they were saying he was doing research on how easy it was to join these sites.  And he was proving that you could actually just with a credit card sign up. 
[01:06:00]  And maybe the credit card companies had denied that they...  I don't know.  It was something like that.  What a brilliant defense.  I don't buy it from...  Oh, no.  Didn't they see that you hadn't downloaded any?  I'm completely remembering something someone said, so I could be wrong.  I just don't buy that.  Mm-hmm.  You probably tried to get the images, and there was some kind of snafu.  You think there was a snafu?  Yeah.  And they were closing in on him, and he was like, oh, thank God for that snafu.  Oh, it's research.  I'm doing research.  So now I could say this and that.  Research. 
[01:06:30]  Right-click, save as, didn't work.  I don't know.  What do you think?  Yeah, who the fuck knows, but he skated.  He did skate 11 years ago.  That was 11 years ago.  Oh, my God.  I went to the fucking circus yesterday with my young kids.  How dare you?  In between football games, I snuck in a little circus.  I thought...  I had to squeeze out...  I had to miss the first half of the Broncos game.  You're entertaining that archaic form of...  Well, I went to Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus last year. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  And I think, if you remember, I was completely annoyed because I can't handle...  I'm a fucking circus faggot.  I can't handle the elephants and the tigers and all that shit anymore.  Because it's just downright depressing.  You just feel bad for the poor little guys.  Yep.  So, I don't really want to go to circuses anymore, but it's not about me when you have kids.  You've got to kind of do the right thing.  And there's not a lot of things to do with your kids in the wintertime, especially...  Museum of Natural History. 
[01:07:30]  We've done.  I guess...  Wait in the planetarium?  No, I haven't done.  That's a good one.  For a three-and-a-half-year-old?  Eh, why not?  Sure.  I'm actually pushing four now.  Wow, we're a few months away from four.  He'll sit back, put his head up, watch the stars spin around.  Yeah?  Eh, I think that's pretty good.  Do you hate when people who aren't parents give you suggestions that aren't practical?  Give them a ball to bounce.  Yeah, that's it.  I like ants' suggestions, though.  I kind of like that.  As a kid, I loved going to those places.  That's three and eight months-ish.  And then I got a 15-month-old, so...  Oh. 
[01:08:00]  That's a little young, I think, for planetarium.  She won't know.  No.  No.  Yeah, but we'll keep her home.  She's still just a thing.  She's coming at her own, bud.  So the Big Apple Circus was very close to my house.  Oh, God.  Very close.  And what is that now?  And I've heard about this Big Apple Circus for many years.  And I could have even got the VIP treatment, and thank God we didn't, because the VIP treatment  was lacking a bit.  Yeah?  They had a room set off to the side where you could, like, be away from people, where 
[01:08:30]  there was food in there, but there was food out here, and...  By the same food.  It was when you're watching the Big Apple, they could no longer perform.  And then the seats we ended up getting were literally right behind the VIP seats, but we  were up higher, so they were better than the VIP...  Whatever.  They were trying to, like, squeeze out a few extra bucks.  Uh-huh.  And I hated it.  Any circus.  And my kids were bored after, like, an hour, and we bailed, even.  It's entertainment from the fucking Middle Ages. 
[01:09:00]  It shouldn't even be a thing anymore.  Here's the problem with the Big Apple Circus, as I see it.  I didn't see one fucking clown.  I guess they're against clown makeup, I think, because...  Wait till Monday morning for that.  Why clown makeup are they against?  I don't...  Why else?  Why wouldn't you have a clown?  You'd think you'd have a clown.  But they had a guy that was a goofball, but he didn't have clown makeup on.  No clown makeup?  No clown shoes?  So what, are they trying to do something a little different, I guess?  I don't know.  And then, instead of having the tigers and elephants that, you know, you could feel bad 
[01:09:30]  about...  Mm-hmm.  I guess the Big Apple Circus has decided if you use horses and dogs, it's not as bad.  Oh, so they get the animals that we're a little more familiar with, you know, fucking with.  I swear to God, one of the acts was...  And it's very close, because it's a small circus tent, so it's like old school.  The horses ran around in a circle over and over again.  They must love that.  Over and over again.  Who cares?  What are they doing?  And who cares? 
[01:10:00]  Like, is that amazing to watch?  And then the trainer was on another horse in the middle with, like, a whip.  Of course.  And everyone, you can tell, everyone's watching that whip, like, you better not fucking hit  that fucking horse.  That fucking horse will come over there and punch you in the face.  And I don't know what else they really did.  I think they twirled.  Oh, my God, it's so smooth.  The fucking...  Yeah, the ladder guy was good.  But here's the problem with the Big Apple Circus.  It's all the acts from America's Got Talent that get voted off.  So they have a place to go. 
[01:10:30]  Like, this guy is doing amazing things with this ladder.  You know, the ladder is in the middle of the square, this tiny little square they set  up.  Yeah, it's just a straight ladder, but he's balancing on it.  Yeah, he's doing some impressive things, but who cares?  It's great.  I watch, you know, people change my light bulbs in my house on one of those.  Yeah, he's taking a ladder.  Good for him.  Wow.  Ooh, look out.  All right.  And then...  Death-defying ladder.  Then they had a juggler that dropped the ball, like, three times.  You can't drop a ball if you're a juggler ever. 
[01:11:00]  You can't.  He dropped it three times, but at the end, he was juggling seven balls.  Why is it called...  Wait a minute.  Big Apple Circus.  Right.  Luminosity.  What does luminosity mean?  I don't know.  Is that their theme?  There was no theme in this big...  There was no theme.  No, I didn't see any theme.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, see, here's the guy that's, like, a clown without the clown makeup.  Big Crapple Circus, I say.  Atta boy, Ant.  Yep.  It didn't hold our attention whatsoever, and then... 
[01:11:30]  The kids didn't even, like, you know...  No, we made a mistake of giving my kid cotton candy, which literally is, like...  A crack.  It's crack.  Crack cocaine for the kids.  It's crack cocaine for the kid.  So he was out of his fucking mind.  Did the sugar get him a little hopped up?  Oh, my God.  He was hopped up.  He was kicking everything.  Oh, that's a clown kind of a thing.  Why no makeup?  I don't know.  Maybe he's allergic.  Plus the music's updated.  That's just it.  Circuses are for fucking... 
[01:12:00]  Well...  Like the 1800s.  If there was TV in the 1800s, circuses wouldn't have made it out of the first city.  No.  By the way, I could have just watched this online, because it's everything I saw.  Right.  This is the...  He's fucking spinning a plate around it.  This entertainment stinks.  You don't find this entertaining?  No!  You know what his act was?  What?  He pulled the tablecloth off the table, and there were, like, stuff on it.  That kid doesn't give a fuck about that. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, volunteer from the audience?  Volunteer from the audience.  You know, get the kids involved.  Oh, look.  She's trying to spin a plate on a thing.  Stinks at it.  But it ain't happening.  And if the shit had fallen all over the floor, that's what the kids would find entertaining.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then they had the two guys that you gotta make believe aren't gay that, like, do that  weird, like, the one guy holds the other guy up by his hands.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a lot of contact, a lot of balancing. 
[01:13:00]  And they're, like, nose to nose at times.  Oh, yeah.  They are.  Oh, these two.  Is this that?  Yes.  Yeah.  See, they're all, America's Got Talent Acts, that failed.  You're absolutely right.  That's what this is.  You son of a bitches are in damn good shape.  They're in arm strength.  All right.  Yeah, they are.  But this went on for 15 minutes.  No kid wants to see this.  They don't give a fuck.  Doing amyl nitrate poppers in between their fucking routines.  I was impressed, because you're like, wow, that's pretty fucked up.  But a kid doesn't understand yet that that's pretty fucked up.  That's amazing, right. 
[01:13:30]  To him, it's like, yeah, whatever.  The one guy is literally balancing his entire body with his one hand on the top of the guy's  head.  Yeah.  But to a kid, what does that mean?  Oh, my God.  Now, his fucking head is right in the other guy's ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we chose radio.  And they were dressed up like construction.  So is everyone else.  They were dressed up like construction workers.  And they took off their construction worker vest.  Juicy. 
[01:14:00]  Listen to this music.  It's like fucking.  It sounds like the closing credits to Chips.  What's that?  Yeah.  Ponch and John are chasing somebody down the I-5.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Nick in Ohio.  Nick.  Hey, yo.  Hey.  You should have took that vaporizer, Pam, with you, buddy.  It would have been a lot better.  Ah.  Now that guy makes a great point.  The old G-Pan.  If you caught a little buzz watching the circus.  The old G-Pan.  Yeah, buddy. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Thanks, sir.  That?  I like who?  Is there any words to this?  I feel bad that you had to go to this.  Oh, the teeter-totter where they fling people up.  You didn't see this?  We left.  Oh, you left?  Yeah.  It was probably one of the big finales.  All right.  It looks like it might be the finale.  Wow.  This is god-awful.  All right.  The guy flipped up onto a chair.  That's like 15 feet in the air. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  And onto stilts.  Yeah.  Is this disco Star Wars?  This is horrible music.  I know.  And he falls onto a fucking big fluffy thing.  He's on a mat.  Gives a turkey.  I just...  Wow, does the Big Apple Circus suck.  Yeah.  Put knives around and make them fall between them.  Yeah.  Do something.  Exactly.  Now.  Oh.  A Times Square tradition.  Oh, no.  Blowjobs through walls?  Yeah.  Or it's a black guy with a CD that he punches you in the face if you don't buy it.  Five, eight, seven, six, six, six, the Israelites. 
[01:15:30]  The New Year.  Five, four, three, two, one.  That's it.  That's a dumb dance number.  That's it.  That's it.  What was that?  It's awful.  What was that?  Did you see that?  Yes.  I didn't know what it was.  They were doing a reenactment of Times Square counting down New Year's Eve, I guess.  I guess.  A guy standing there pissing into a cup behind another guy. 
[01:16:00]  But it doesn't work if there's only ten people.  No.  True.  It only works if there's two million.  Oh, my God.  This is awful.  This is terrible.  The non-profit Big Apple Circus has entertained.  What do you mean the non-profit?  Oh, now they're going to try to make us feel bad that it's for charity.  Well, you know what?  I think circuses that make a profit are way better.  Yeah.  Apparently you need that profit.  Please take a profit so I can see some cool shit.  Wait, do they use animals cruelly or no? 
[01:16:30]  No, they use dogs and horses.  The dogs, I don't know, one dog.  No, and then they had a little pony, those mini ponies.  Dog and pony show?  See, it was a subway thing because the pony would run around a circle but stop under these platforms  and these little dogs would jump on top to catch a ride to the next platform.  That sounds adorable.  It was amazing.  First resident hospital clowning program.  Oh, see, now they're going to the hospital with the clown. 
[01:17:00]  Look, just because you do good things for sick kids doesn't mean your circus doesn't blow.  The circus can't even afford makeup.  Yeah.  What?  It just reminded me of that awful, sad story from yesterday.  Oh.  Just when they showed him, I was like, oh.  Progerio Sam?  Yeah, fuck.  We weren't here Friday.  No.  We were talking about Progerio Sam on Friday saying how great he's doing and he should be  around for at least a few more years.  And as we're saying this on the radio, he was probably dying. 
[01:17:30]  And we brought him up out of nowhere.  Do we have that clip from Friday?  Okay.  Yeah.  Was it fast-paced and acrobatic thrills and magical?  What?  That's what they're saying, the Big Apple Circus.  No.  Oh.  It was none of that.  None of those?  None of the above?  No.  That looks awful.  But maybe it's meant for kids that are a little older than mine.  I don't know.  I think it's meant for kids that get no entertainment.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:18:00]  And then they had the guy that has a picture pockets.  That was pretty impressive.  Was that part of the show or just outside?  Brought a guy on stage and by the end he had his wallet, his watch, his phone, his tickets,  and the guy had no fucking idea.  Damn.  But then he did it over and over again.  Oh, right.  To show, look, it wasn't, you know, I didn't just get lucky by doing this.  Oh, Jesus.  So then he did it over and over and over again.  Enough.  And then he told the guy to go back to his seat four times. 
[01:18:30]  But, hold on a minute, I still got your wallet.  I still got that.  So then he put the wallet back in and then he put the wallet back in and then showed that  he actually didn't put the wallet back in because it showed it behind his head so we  could be in on the gag.  And then he goes, all right, go back to your seat.  You got everything now.  And then, oh, wait, one moment.  And then, is this yours?  And it was his fucking cell phone.  Spoiler alert.  And then he goes, you should keep the cell phone in your front pocket.  So he puts the cell phone back in his front pocket.  But he didn't really.  You're absolutely right.  You know how this goes. 
[01:19:00]  And then he showed the cell phone behind the guy's head so we're still in on the joke.  Uh-huh.  And then that went on about two or three more times before he fucking...  Oh, God.  He fucking...  Enough.  Let this guy sit down.  Jesus.  And I swear to you, if I saw my, especially my son having a good time, I wouldn't care.  Of course.  But I'm like, holy fuck, he doesn't give a fuck about this.  He wanted to go home.  And we set it up as his big surprise for the day. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  And he goes, I liked my surprise, but I didn't like any of that stuff going on.  Oh, see, he knows that shit.  It's like, yeah, I like that.  You know, I appreciate the effort.  I appreciate that you gave me a surprise today.  I like that you put in the effort, Pops, but wow.  I don't want you to feel bad, but I didn't like that.  I remember when my dad used to try to do things like that.  Surprises?  Yeah, like weekend things, you know.  We'd do weekend things, and then we would go to, like, Adventureland out there in Farmingdale.  Right.  And I wouldn't want to go on any of the rides because I was scared. 
[01:20:00]  Even the Adventureland rides?  Yeah.  This is like a mini theme park for the rest of the country.  Oh, it's just terrible.  It's a terrible place.  Everything is just smaller in scale.  And then my dad would ask me a viable question.  Why do I have to be such a faggot?  Well, could you answer the question?  Because we've been mulling the same one.  Mulling.  I know.  But he would get annoyed that you didn't go on the rides. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, you know.  But how old were you?  I was probably...  I guess I was 7 or 8, something like that.  Oh, my God.  And...  Kind of have a little understanding.  Nah, at that point, you know, I was being a little faggot.  Joe would go.  Even my sister Dawn.  I'd have to sit there at the bottom of the...  Remember that one...  I don't know if you remember the one ride at Adventureland.  You got in a little car.  Right.  And it would go straight up.  Right.  Through the middle of this, like, rocket-looking thing.  I know which one you're talking about.  And then it would come out the top, and then it would just spiral its way down... 
[01:21:00]  All the way down to the bottom.  To the bottom.  I didn't want to go on that.  What?  Because I was scared.  I was sticking up for you.  So I had to stand there while I watched my dad and my little sister go on the ride,  because she wasn't scared of it.  And then I would just sit there, stand there, and, you know, have to be like, oh, you...  Your tummy hurt?  My tummy...  Yeah, I got a stomach ache.  That was my battle cry.  My battle cry was, I got a stomach ache. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  But that's all right.  And then we would go to bars and stuff, and Dad would drink and talk to people that he probably  owed money to while we sat and drank Shirley Temples in a booth.  Well, that sounds like fun.  That was fun.  That was a fun weekend.  Yeah, when my dad brought me into a bar or something when I was a kid, that was like,  holy fuck.  Or we'd go fishing sometimes.  We would take a rowboat out of North Port.  That's nice.  You guys could only afford a rowboat?  It was a little rowboat.  Well, it was like Uncle Mario had a... 
[01:22:00]  We had no money, but our boat had a fucking motor on it when we went fishing.  No.  Uncle Mario had a rowboat, and we used to go see him, and...  You had to row out to the middle of the harbor or whatever?  Oh, Dad would fucking get on them oars and row out, and I would get seasick and start  crying, and I would lay my head down on the bottom of the boat, and then the bait crabs  got in my hair.  Did you scream?  Oh, boy, did I ever.  Oh, sure.  My dad probably just wanted to throw me overboard at that point. 
[01:22:30]  But you didn't mean for the bait crabs to get in there?  No, I was petrified.  So you felt...  Bait crabs.  How did they fucking...  How did you notice they were in your hair?  I felt them crawling around in my hair.  How many were there?  There were a lot.  They were covering my head, because I had to lay down in the bottom of a rowboat.  I'm laying down on the woods.  But why would you have the crabs just on the bottom of the rowboat?  Why would they be in a bucket?  They probably snuck out of something.  They were.  They were.  It tipped over or something.  You know, my dad was probably reaching for another alcoholic beverage, and...  Gotcha.  You know, it fell over.  And they saw your giant mat of brown salvation and went to Hydenus. 
[01:23:00]  Saw that afro.  Thought it was a coral reef.  Like, oh, good.  Lawrence Hilton Jacobs is on the boat.  He's hiding his hair.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, all the fun things.  Very good.  By the way, speaking of, like, kids, kid entertainment in New York in general, Big Apple Circus.  Could say, Keir, the man dressed as Woody from Toy Story arrested for groping women in Times Square. 
[01:23:30]  These guys are fucking creeps, man.  It's about time to get rid of those fucking things.  They're useless.  We've talked about these guys over the years, right?  Yeah.  I'm not one to, you know, hey, get that out of there.  Get that out of Times Square.  They are nothing but annoying in the way and potentially dangerous.  I hate when the city regulates shit, but then you realize, like, they don't have a choice  after a while.  Yeah.  You know, like, the pedicabs, they were, like, they were kind of cool when they popped up  at first.  And then there were hundreds of them out of nowhere.  And so now they had figured they had to kind of regulate the whole business. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, they were just fucking up traffic.  You know, because I hate when the city gets involved with anything.  But I think they got to regulate these assholes.  Yeah.  Because they're groping.  One guy pushed a kid because the mom didn't tip after they took a picture.  See, I think people get confused when they look at the cute little cartoony faces.  In Times Square.  Because underneath there are animals.  Are literally criminals.  They're fucking the dregs of society criminals that if they weren't wearing that suit, you 
[01:24:30]  would push your kid away and guide them away from these people.  Right.  Just because they're in some suit, these dumb tourists think it's okay to put your kid  in their fucking arms?  Right.  You dummies.  Right.  I think that people assume that they work for somebody official there.  Oh, probably.  Do you know what I mean?  Oh, they wouldn't be here if they didn't work for the city.  Because you're a rube.  That ham-handed segue.  Yes.  And more and more are popping up down there in Times Square. 
[01:25:00]  Down there, we're pretty much in Times Square right here.  We're down one of the side streets to Times Square for the people that care.  Yeah.  Why should it make a difference that somebody's dressed like fucking Elmo  that you then have this trust that you thrust your dumb kid in their fucking arms so they  could grope them?  Yeah.  Google image, Times Square, is it Elmo?  Well, and then they all pop up where they're in handcuffs with their head off.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, and believe me, when that head comes off of these fucking things, it's never what 
[01:25:30]  you expect.  Has that fucking head come off?  There you go.  There's Juan being hauled away into the NYPD vehicle.  He has to hold his Elmo head as he's handcuffed.  Oh, poor cop's got to put an Elmo head in his trunk.  Smell that fucking horrible.  You know what those things smell like?  The stink.  Wow.  E.  Let's go back to our bit.  Oh, that was the Philly Philly Fanatic.  One of the worst smells.  Okay, man.  And we had to smell some shit over the years with this radio show. 
[01:26:00]  The old Philly Philly.  But the Philly Philly Philly could be one of the worst smells we ever smelled in studio.  Philly Philly Philly.  And we smelled rank pussy and fucking dripping assholes and all sorts of stuff.  Someone mentioned me the baby diaper mustache last night.  What smelled worse, that or the Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly  Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Philly Ph 
[01:26:30]  after police said they saw him groping women in Times Square  while dressed as Woody from Toy Story.  How do you get that done?  What a guy.  What, do you put your arm around, you know,  and maybe grab a tit or something?  Maybe you do that. 
[01:27:00]  That's kind of ballsy, man.  Grab a tit.  It's not hard to figure out, you know, to point you out.  If they're next to you and you just fucking grab their snatch.  Grab their ass a little bit.  While they're next to you.  Put your arm down the front and just grab or snatch.  If you get punched, it won't hurt as much  because you've got that giant helmet on.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever it is.  And to the people in this business, you know,  you did it to yourselves because I don't like this,  but the next line is the Times Square Alliance  is now calling for greater regulations of costume characters.  You guys did it to yourselves. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Because you've got to now regulate these idiots down there.  Got to self-police and fucking kick some of these guys' asses.  Right.  Get them out of there.  They want them licensed and regulated.  Good.  First of all, to be licensed, to be something,  they're not paying a fee to use the images of these characters.  It's like, do you think Disney wants how protective they are of everything?  That they want some guy in Times Square representing a Disney character? 
[01:28:00]  Fuck no.  Here's a witness.  The first time we heard about this was a co-worker who came into the office and said,  on my way to work today, Elmo just pinched me on the bottom.  Oh.  Some of them can be up in your face.  They're a little bit of pushing and shoving to try and get tips.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're very aggressive if you don't tip them.  Because you just assume, oh, I'm walking through Times Square.  Oh, look.  You know, you've got a kid.  Oh, fucking Woody from Toy Story.  Go get a picture.  But they don't want that.  They want a fucking tip. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Period.  They're not doing this for fun whatsoever.  Yeah.  Woody Washington.  That's who's in that suit.  It's Woody.  Yo, Woody Washington.  It's actually Vasquez.  Yeah, Vasquez is a Hispanic gentleman.  Yes, I believe so.  So.  Yeah.  Just don't fucking, you know, don't pay these guys to fucking smell up your kids. 
[01:29:00]  What's wrong with you people?  So trusting.  People are idiots.  I know we've got a lot of hunters out there.  This story bothers me.  I've got to say it.  The Black Rhino thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not into this.  This bothers me, man.  I'm not into that big game hunting shit.  I know we fucking get killed for taking this stance on this one.  I don't know.  What do you think the percentage of people are?  I think a lot of people also agree with this.  Against this.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Black Rhino hunting permit auctioned for 350,000 proceeds will go to conservation efforts. 
[01:29:30]  So they're killing a black rhino to get some things done is basically what they're trying to say.  Got to sacrifice one.  The need of the many outweigh the need of the few or the one.  Well, they sold the permit.  Is that guy going to use the permit?  Because the money he said went to whatever.  A permit to hunt an endangered.  An endangered African black rhino.  There you go.  Why would you want to do that?  Because all of us.  Like, but why would you want to do that?  Like, what kind of a cunt are you that you want to go and hunt something?  Commander McBrag.  Who's that? 
[01:30:00]  There I was.  Right.  Africa.  Deepest dark as Africa.  A black rhino was charging at me.  Oh, my goodness.  Whatever did you do, McBrag?  Well, I grabbed my fucking, and then he fucking kills him somehow.  I don't know.  It's a specific rhino.  What?  Like, the permit is for it.  One rhino.  Like, not a type.  A specific.  Wow, it's a fucking bounty on one guy?  It's an old rhino that apparently they plan on taking out anyway because he's aggressive  towards other rhinos.  Because he's a rhino.  How about they just let nature do its job and fucking don't get their greedy cocksucker 
[01:30:30]  hands in there?  Because this way they get $350.  But I'm not, I don't know, I don't know if I'm buying it.  It seems like they're trying to justify it a little bit.  Like, look, look, look, before you get all mad and outraged, you know, it's an older one.  We've got to get rid of him anyway because he's being aggressive to everybody else.  I got an idea.  Bare hands.  Nice.  You just have to use your bare hands and see if you can take down the old rhino.  You're just punching a rhino in his face.  Your fists are bleeding.  And this is why these guys are so fucking hateable. 
[01:31:00]  Because the auction took place Saturday night in downtown Dallas under tight security and  behind closed doors.  You fucking cocksuckers want to go out and hunt something with your gun, that's fine, but  you want to do your thing, like, all secret?  Where's your balls?  Yeah.  You got guns.  Yeah.  Oh, the black rhino you're not scared of.  Some big, dumb, lurking idiot in the fucking, you know, just wants to bully a few of the  rhinos and feel good about himself.  Well, I'm sure they wanted to fucking cut down on the, um, heckling and yelling and protesters 
[01:31:30]  that are so fucking annoying on either side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Murderer!  You're trying to just talk with your friends.  Murderer!  Murderer!  You!  Murderer!  Oh, man.  I'm just trying to have a beer here with my pal.  I love the best, the best part of those is, no, no, no, let him, no, let him talk.  Let him, dude, let him talk.  Let him talk.  Oh, but I would defend his right to say it.  No, no, no, no, don't take him out.  Let him talk.  Oh, nothing better than hearing that and then the clicking of that taser. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, that was great.  The tickety tick of the taser.  Don't tase me, bro.  Don't tase me, bro.  Um, I don't know, like Travis said, um, you know, this rhino's old, male, and non-breeding,  and the animal was likely to be targeted for removal anyway because it was becoming aggressive  and threatening other wildlife.  Removal.  Let nature take care of that shit.  Mm-mm-mm.  He's a dick rhino.  And then the money will be used, uh, for some good things. 
[01:32:30]  Will they grind up his horn for some fucking Japanese dick powders?  Probably.  The Japanese love their rhino horn dick powder.  One of our sponsors, I think.  Ah-ha.  Never seen...  The Japanese rhino dick horn powder dick.  You watch any of those, uh, shows like Bizarre Food and all that.  Yeah.  And they'll travel to Japan or one of those Asian, Asian, Asian nations.  Hong Kong?  And, and, yeah, no, not Hong Kong this time. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Not, not this time.  Oh, all right.  And, uh, they go to the food markets, the, the horrible food markets.  Yeah, yeah.  And they'll just show a pile of black rhino fucking horns.  Horns.  And I just, I just automatically get so depressed for human nature.  It really is.  You know it's happening, but then they, they just have a whole bin and, you know, it's just  hundreds of animals and it's just in some shitty food.  Slaughtered.  Fucking food market now. 
[01:33:30]  Ah, God.  Because they think, yeah, that it's going to do something for their fucking inadequate  dick.  To their peonies.  Yeah.  To their peonies.  So when, when are they going to kill the black rhino?  And what are they, the other part I don't like about this is it's usually like in just  an enclosed area more or less.  Right?  Yeah.  What do they do?  They didn't even really have to hunt the thing.  Put them on one side of a field.  You're on the other and you just got to fucking make your shot.  Yeah.  Go at it. 
[01:34:00]  It's just some fucking jerk off trying to make himself feel better about himself.  Look what I did.  And you can take that picture next to it.  Yeah.  Look at my picture.  Look what I did.  Look what I did.  Look what I did.  My gun.  I shot the thing.  It was running, but I shot it.  Look what I did.  Fucking assholes.  And all you hunters that get mad when I say this, A, too bad.  B, I'm not talking about the guys that hunt and eat.  There's a difference between a deer hunter who's got, like Ted Nugent, as annoying as he  can be, the guy I think just does hunt things. 
[01:34:30]  He reminds you that he uses every single part of the animal.  Yeah, that's fine.  I get no issue with that.  And feeds the hungry and then homeless with the meat that he kills.  Yeah.  I have no issue with that.  Yeah.  Not at all.  But if you spend that much money and actually want to use a permit to go and kill an endangered  species, I hope your fucking plane goes down and you're the only one who's killed.  Everyone else survives.  Oh, how about, no, the plane crashes in the Serengeti and you're wounded enough where you  can't really move.  And then you start hearing stuff like out in the middle of the, oh, man. 
[01:35:00]  And then they just fucking eat you.  And I think the problem here is if this goes well, then they got to find another old black  rhino.  But then they're like, you know what?  Oh, this one's sort of old.  This one's sort of old.  Well, then you fast forward five years and they're just fucking taking out rhinos left  and right.  Some young baby rhino jumping around, playing and frolicking.  They just put a slug through his head.  You know?  Because how do you say no to that money if this goes well? 
[01:35:30]  And I guess it did.  Yeah.  Because they made $350,000 off it.  Of course they're going to want to do it next year.  Yeah.  So they're like, all right, you think there's another old rhino out there somewhere?  We could use another $350,000.  You ever see those piles of buffalo skulls from the 1800s on the plains when they used  to just flash the fucking buffaloes?  And after they would strip everything that they needed, the pelts and everything, they  would stack these skulls up. 
[01:36:00]  And Sam, if you could find that, it's 1800s buffalo skull mounds, I guess.  You cannot imagine there were even that many buffalo when you look at how many fucking  skulls.  That's a pile of skulls?  Right there.  Look at that.  We just suck.  Those are buffalo skulls.  No way.  That's insane.  You sure that's not just more of the animal?  No.  That's just the skulls? 
[01:36:30]  Just the skulls.  They grind them up and make fertilizer out of it.  We put all this stuff on our Facebook page, right?  Yeah.  What is our Facebook page these days?  It's a mountain.  O and A show?  Yeah.  O and A show on Facebook.  That pile, let's say it's a six-foot man.  That's one, two, three.  That could be 30 feet high.  Yeah.  And just way out over the sides.  And way out to the sides at least, I don't know, I'd have to say at least 30 to 40 yards  sideways, right? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  It's a crazy amount.  And there were a bunch of those piles.  And they would just grind it up and make fertilizer out.  What do you mean a bunch of piles?  They killed so many buffalo.  How many buffalo did we have at one time?  I hear the planes were alive with buffalo.  Like herds that you couldn't not see the herd.  No.  People used to want a home where the buffalo would fucking hang out and walk around.  What do you mean you couldn't see the herd?  Like you couldn't see where it ended or began. 
[01:37:30]  It would go to the horizon and to the left and right either way.  Like you would, it was full of buffalo.  Just fucking packed giant herds of buffalo.  And then when they put the railroad through and stuff, people would just shoot them out  the windows of the train just for fun.  Jesus.  Just blast them out the window.  And now what?  We have 100?  Now there's like 10 left.  I don't know.  Fucking we make burgers out of them.  There's so few rhinos.  They actually know them by name.  Well, he bought a permit to shoot Herb. 
[01:38:00]  Who's Herb?  He's that dick rhino that was bullying Jerry, Mary, and Teddy.  Oh, no.  How do they all have American names in Africa?  I don't know because Jim doesn't improv foreign names.  Yeah, apparently that's true.  I've never seen the pile of skulls before.  And they were killing off the number one food source of the American Indians.  So that kind of helped too.  You want to get rid of your enemy.  What was our main reason for killing all the buffalo? 
[01:38:30]  Oh, there was no heat back then.  Nope.  So you would fucking take those big furry things and wrap them around you.  Make all kinds of fun stuff out of it.  I think the idea of extinction back then too because growth wasn't as fast as it is now.  I think just the concept that we're going to wipe out a species didn't mean as much  because survival was a little more...  You probably never thought you could do it.  Yeah, and it just didn't pretty resonate.  Whereas now I think people are kind of okay with the natural enemies and elements.  Yeah.  It is pretty amazing to think that back then there was the capability of really impacting a whole species. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  It's fucked up.  Because you'd think, yeah, how many people are out there out west shooting these things?  It couldn't possibly add up.  And then it looked like, what were they using, fucking machine guns?  Right.  These are all single-shot fucking little Winchesters.  The human perspective is really strange.  Yeah.  Look at that pile of buffalo skulls.  And I swear, you could show that picture to 100 people today, they wouldn't be that face.  Nah.  But if it's people, you know? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, well, that would be...  That's like a major deal.  Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge did that many skulls and they were human.  But that's because of the human perspective.  I mean, if you look at it like the universe, I think the universe, whatever that is, would  have a major problem with that.  You think like the essence of the universe would look at that and say, oh, that wasn't  what you were supposed to do with those things.  You weren't supposed to do that.  It's all about what we see as human beings.  Yeah.  But the universe doesn't fucking look at it that way whatsoever. 
[01:40:00]  Unbelievable.  Yeah, pass that fucking vaporizer over here now.  You've had it long enough.  You've had it long enough.  It's just sitting there.  I don't know what I want to do with my pot.  You're going to vape, dude?  I don't think so.  No.  Maybe every...  Maybe every...  If it makes me sleep better.  Dude, if it helps me sleep better, I'd start fucking...  I'd fucking eat pot out of an HIV positive asshole if it helped me sleep better.  Whoa. 
[01:40:30]  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, we have the Sam clip from Friday?  We have that, right, Travis?  All right, we'll play it after the break, because I think it's break time anyway.  All righty.  And then we've got to get into the A-Rod thing.  A-Rod.  And other stuff, too.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.  Because we're as cold as the Ice Road Truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies. 
[01:41:00]  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, we're sick, we're sick fucking puppies.  Bucking up your tree.  clean the bowl with your song  opie and anthony are back 
[01:41:30]  how's everyone doing oh lovely nice  well on friday we talked about uh sam  progeria sam little progeria sam i think anthony was the one that turned us on to this uh  documentary on hbo sam burns i loved it but we were talking about this on friday out of nowhere 
[01:42:00]  do we have the clip travis that we can play really fast i'll tell you that uh that hbo  documentary on sam uh yes progeria kid turned me around for real that's a great one uh little  progeria kid yeah i didn't get in uh the massachusetts area yep what has the longest uh living progeria  kid at this point yeah what is he 17 17 18 he's how old does he look amazingly smart 108 for real for real 
[01:42:30]  yeah look oh but he is the coolest dude going yeah but that kid turned me around to him yes  and his parents working their asses off to try to figure it out they're pretty much one step away  from just having test tubes and beakers in their house and and mixing shit up the mom is an amazing  individual and she figured out a lot of stuff great documentary that has prolonged his life and it looks  like he's gonna he's gonna have at least a few more years and most most people are long gone by 
[01:43:00]  by his age whoops that was friday he's not the oldest living progeria kid i mean like you know he  died he wasn't the oldest living one this one are you i certainly am not a progeria kid i'm a healthy  adult male i know jimmy there's a 20 year old progeria kid wow right who i think is the oldest one  that was friday we were talking about it out of nowhere and young whoops young sam burns died uh  a few hours after that that discussion we had on the on the radio got a couple more years 
[01:43:30]  kind of creepy no someone pointed out on twitter we've done that a few times where we'll talk about  someone out of nowhere then you know oh yeah the person fucking dies after that i don't know  yes yeah so what happened to sam burns uh they just said uh you know succumb to um  progeria complications due to progeria how old was he 17 79 and he was supposed to be what honorary  the honorary captain for the pats game yeah the pats game um yeah that didn't happen wow 
[01:44:00]  how sad man the day before such a nice yeah fucking awful dude that really depressed me when i read that  because he was such a likable and you just realize like no matter all the love and all the hard work  and it just maybe it bought him a little extra time but they just couldn't fix him entirely a couple  years maybe yeah that's just you know fucking genetic anomaly there yeah what are you gonna do  but it's so full of life it makes you wake the fuck up oh really i'm i'm really i'm bothered by this 
[01:44:30]  little thing in my life it's all relative yeah if you're gonna fucking eat it out till 75 80 years  old or you know maybe you take a few days and you just relax on the couch that guy wasn't that the  lifespan of a mayfly you're gonna fucking be every day is uh but he wasn't bothered bothered by anything  he was full of life we whine and complain all the fucking time yeah and i'm talking about everyone 
[01:45:00]  everyone  yeah that was uh horrible news i liked that everybody was really nice to him though  yeah yeah yeah he really kind of i i before that all you got was that maury povich exploitation  kind of you know put him in a wastebasket yeah put him in a fucking let's see how small they are  put him in a little small setting let's hear him talk in that voice and we'll have him read lines  from the lollipop guild and shit like that did he really have him do that no oh but but he did play 
[01:45:30]  hide and seek though with the uh the primordial dwarfs oh what's the difference there you are i see you  in the bookshelf you found me maury oh no you ever see that i did but what's it i thought they were  progeria kids they're not becky becky you're in the garbage pail that's right maury she's looking up  oh god looking up from the garbage pail at maury they're different they look like those little  things from the dark crystal wow very good and uh and they uh live a lot longer do they i believe so 
[01:46:00]  yeah i think they make it to like you know their 30s oh wow but uh fun fact yeah fun fact he was like  the first kid that you got to hear speak at length about um progeria and just you know his life what  he does before that no one even thought about it no they're like oh wow that's pretty fucked up 
[01:46:30]  anyway anyway moving on want to go get a beer or something yeah that's the problem with those  diseases where it's like hey lucky you that's one in a quadrillion uh people that get this  because then you don't get the medical attention get the funding and the funding because people say  well you know we got to play the numbers here and diabetes yeah ms and your kid uh kind of doesn't  fall but then his parents both being doctors kind of brought it out into the forefront right  they were very educated and articulate and conveying what uh was needed right for these kids and stuff 
[01:47:00]  and uh i think they made an impact i think they put a dent in it you know absolutely yeah yeah i think  it'll get a lot more attention i'm sure the parents work will still continue with uh progeria kids and  and whatever you know they were good people they were definitely people solid and uh you know god  speed god speed  into your next fucking whatever it is  well we move on to governor christie who's keeping it very quiet 
[01:47:30]  yeah for a politician that likes to be front and center he's being very quiet since it's almost two  hour uh press conference hour and 48 minutes whatever it was yeah you could you could speculate  that he spoke so much at the press conference that he's just letting that settle in and letting the  investigators do their investigating if he truly feels like he didn't know shit i you gotta think  he'd be out front and center everywhere just keep pushing that almost looks like point i'll protested 
[01:48:00]  too much though he he was up there for fucking a long time and that's strange over and over again  almost like he was trying to convince himself if i stay up here long enough here's my take on it i  think i i don't think he had anything to do with the execution of this whatsoever i don't think he was  in on any uh planning um where i have my doubts is that after it happened and in between when it became 
[01:48:30]  exposed yeah was there any cover up shenanigan finagling going on about him saying all right how do we keep  this quiet or something oh when did he find out about it and what did he say he said he found out  about it with everyone else you know on the news and that but if it it turns out he found out about  it beforehand and was trying to you know cover it up he's done he's done he found out way before he 
[01:49:00]  said he did what did he say after his workout he's like i've worked out man uh and then i found  out when uh everybody else did no way there's no way what he says when there were rumblings  that's his stomach he was very hungry what do you think jimmy i don't know i mean we didn't talk to  you after his press conference because you were in north carolina i think he um might have found out  there's something maybe i'm just being naive but there's something about the way he denied it which  was convincing like when he said things like i never would have been out there joking if i had 
[01:49:30]  known makes sense and that also make does make perfect sense growing in words like unequivocally  like i did not know let me say this again like it doesn't leave you any wiggle room maybe he's a good  lawyer maybe but he's also by lying like that if he's lying he's saving he's giving himself not one  ounce of room to go i meant something they usually they keep it ambiguous when they're like you know um i did  not know about this or like they don't state it with such certainty and absolution yeah but maybe 
[01:50:00]  he did know after and maybe that's what he was trying to clear himself up before he spoke my staff  was briefing me uh earlier about like you would say something like that yeah like that leaves you like  yeah well i told you my staff told me when i said they were briefing me on he's like nope nothing  knew nothing did you see someone put his face in the sergeant schultz helmet i know nothing he looked  apart yeah big fathead leno had a good joke that he's denying everything he's sounding even more  presidential yeah that was good that is good where's leno going he ain't retiring uh what's the rumblings 
[01:50:30]  what do you know jimmy i think he has to i'm guessing he has to sit for a while because his staff is  being paid throughout their contract i think which i believe goes till i want to say the end of 2014  or early 2015. it's a year early i think that that they're pushing him out i don't know where he's  going believe me i hope it's on the west coast and that they continue to fly me out there yeah but i  have no idea what is it about leno why are they pushing him out a year early when he's still doing 
[01:51:00]  it right he's still he still has good ratings the argument that they probably made i from what i've  heard i think maybe it was in the paper article we read lauren said to uh again nbc how much of a  head start are you going to give kimmel so kimmel going to 11 30 might have forced nbc's hand  because they might have been like well kimmel's going to build up this nice following and then  when it's jimmy's time people will be so used that's my guess so used to turning on kimmel at this time  i've also read that uh they really wanted to use the olympics as a launch pad kind of a thing uh no 
[01:51:30]  maybe a springboard oh a springboard i go with launch pad damn it i go with teeter-totter  with a rock at the end to drop on it rolls off the tongue yeah i don't know leno goes to cnn  i've heard that i've also heard fox i've heard abc you know he's not retiring though he's got a few  years left in him fucking fallon man jesus christ did he step in shit it's amazing he's great pops on  there he's great he does a talk show that people you know they i think everybody gets that doubt when 
[01:52:00]  somebody gets a new talk show the first thing your first thing you say is oh that'll never last  after one show they're like oh he sucks uh and then in five short years you know he's fucking  last the tonight show conan must be fucking livid oh but he's doing great where he is right i was  past all the still great where he is all the supporters are watching this show tbs very funny  still great over there isn't he if something's funny and no one's there to hear it is it really 
[01:52:30]  funny current also like he wouldn't the same situation would have happened it's not like he  would have gotten that tonight show and been successful anyway the whole thing about jimmy  fallon is that he's treating it like you're supposed to treat a tonight show now and doing stuff for the  internet and yes it's got to be updated and current and things like that like kimmel has done with his  show yes conan's still old school he's not uh that young upstart anymore no he's been out of 20 years 
[01:53:00]  i think yeah lauren's getting the fucking franchise man and then yeah because uh who's taking over  seth myers seth myers takes over fucking jimmy fallon spot is he gonna be good you think  i don't know he's a funny guy i'm just gonna say fail to fail no he's when you watch him on  fucking we can update the guy is he's a great no he's got jokes and i think i think i think he'll  be okay i think he'll be good but he's not quite as charming as jimmy fallon is well that's true  you know that charm that jimmy fallon is a charming motherfucker that's gonna like that pig arnold from 
[01:53:30]  green acres i think we'll get fallon on our show again maybe yes i say yes he's keeping the show  in new york he's taking the show to just keep it but but then new york that's the cool thing  they're going back to new york with it carson's old studio that is amazing what's in there now  i don't know what have they done with carson studio since and where is it uh it's here in  new york i don't know it's not 30 rock though it may be i don't know why don't you know not 
[01:54:00]  helping if i know what's in carson's christmas has it been just sitting there waiting yeah it's  just sitting there still fucking i don't that studio thing is like you know they they don't  get smart in this space get smart who cares it is funny that you do kind of put this reverence  in a place you hear it all the time in hollywood you know on this lot they did i love yeah i  agree that's right there is desi's bungalow where he uh but it doesn't look like in a lot 
[01:54:30]  of bung but it doesn't look like it did in the past if they kept it as it was then that  would be kind of cool i guess it really is just a warehouse that you replace yes you strip  it down to stone yeah it's a it's an empty space yeah absolutely you weren't thinking  about the fact that the beatles were standing on that stage playing at the ed sullivan not  really yeah not really because it doesn't look like the ed sullivan no it does studio uh yes  e rock e cold um fallon is using carson's old studio and seth myers is using the old 
[01:55:00]  caroline ray studio say it's been pretty empty for a while what are they gonna do a fallon  studio which is conan's old studio he's staying and that's no conan was out in la uh conan  in new york was using letterman's old studio it's now dr oz what's going on you're all right  he's nervous are you okay what happened not to like sneeze breath what were you out of  breath no how's the diet going exercise you still doing you got sick yeah i um i'm trying 
[01:55:30]  to will i walk up the hallway yeah that's exactly what it is i did friday night videos in conan's  old studio years ago yes where it's very stop at the old studio thing i don't care i like  saying old studio it makes me feel like i've been around the business a while yes but it's  just like sam said it's an empty warehouse space that they make into something cool they  make this into a tv studio yeah what was this no you can't serious apparently not what pharrell 
[01:56:00]  studio no what was this before it was even a fucking oh xm studio like a financial floor  yeah like oh boy did i tell you that this where we're sitting stocks were being traded  this is caroline ray remember caroline ray she did a comic show was she the blonde yeah she was on it  was she the first host host of biggest loser i think she might have been now you mentioned  i think she was trying to capitalize on the success of like rosie she was trying to do like a rosie type 
[01:56:30]  show yeah yeah yeah yeah she was on that teenage witch show yeah sabrina that's sabrina right  why would you bring up the fact that she that they're using caroline ray's old studio the old  studio i get to i get she was barely in it i don't think she lasted a year i know the studio with a  rich broadcasting tradition like connect caroline ray where's woody on fox film director missed his honor  because he does never shows up they had diane keaton uh accept the award last night and now fox is all 
[01:57:00]  about it where's woody i'll bet that they're talking about hold on join us with  the highlights and the lowlights from last night no oh they won't thank you guys all right  bye dominic all right i bet he gets his fucking nobody sends a legal team after anyone that even  fucking mentions it they don't even want to be bothered read about the tweets that his estranged son  yeah certainly did we're tweeting yeah we got to talk about what what well that that son might be  frank sinatra's son that's it right and it looks just like a young sinatra new york papers did something 
[01:57:30]  on that recently uh you know many years they thought it was woody's son biologically anyway  and now they're starting to hint that it looks like it could be frank sinatra's son what i read  me a faro me a faro is saying yeah it could be sinatra's son it could be but no dna test for that  this is what bothers me why wouldn't you do a dna test to determine who if he hates woody so much and  he obviously does why wouldn't he want that fucking completely wiped clean from the record what his  son hates him oh ronan faro yeah based on the uh based on the tweet that he sent yeah what was the 
[01:58:00]  tweet he sent do we have that tweet in front of us we do tweet i believe we do uh look let's start by  saying that we're all woody allen fans he certainly makes some amazing i don't like the guy really i love  him you don't like his movies no no i really don't i got the tweet here if you want why not  uh why not it's really are odd to say um and it sounds like you know i'm being i'm joking and 
[01:58:30]  stuff but i honestly think he's very over fucking rated never really liked his stuff i i don't like  his style of comedy i don't like his yeah it's supposedly like this genius element in his movies  but i i've seen a lot of goofiness and slapstick and and just shit that i never really considered  amazing comedy about zellig to me it's not like schmelig that was right that's what i say like  any hall any hall any small that's what i say whoa was that the one he did i think it was any hall 
[01:59:00]  where they're online debating some director yeah or whatever some author and the pompous asshole  behind them is going well no technically and then from off screen the author just walks on  and says what an asshole this guy really is and then walk like it was weird little shit like he did  like that uh-huh brilliant brilliant yeah yeah i'm not saying you know he just doesn't have some  fucking shit going on some talent but i mean i think it's way overrated i find his movies a chore to  watch a lot of times they're just fucking dull see midnight in paris uh no i haven't seen that one 
[01:59:30]  that was a good movie i didn't see that one colin hated that movie did he yeah why what was his take  on it probably because it was fun and happy for all yeah no i think he just thought the message  was stupid but i liked it yeah i can't speak for coming who writes lines like these pretzels are  making me thirsty that makes sense it's from a woody allen movie yeah yeah pretzels will make a person  thirsty depending on the salt yeah it's that side film sure of course it is i heard you got me twice 
[02:00:00]  on friday two of them went over my head on friday i heard so uh what was the tweet so woody allen got  some kind of lifetime was it the vanguard what is the van i don't know this video vanguard award  what is your vanguard what kind of award lifetime achievement in film vanguard what was it for  it was for his lifetime in film it was the cecil b de mill oh the cecil b de mill right cecil b de 
[02:00:30]  mill i'm ready for my close-up mr de mill and then what he signed what he wasn't at this thing to get  the award no he doesn't really show up to these things in general right no no no why it's just who  he is the tonight show i heard offered him the entire hour he could play clarinet do whatever the  fuck he for an hour what he could have just stood on a box and fucking tap dance while juggling apples 
[02:01:00]  yes and he wouldn't take he just he will not do it it's just not what he likes didn't it used to be  like oscar night he would fucking go and play clarinet down at uh yeah that fucking bar then  at least he's been consistent with that shit like he's not a fake when it comes to not uh going to  thing he just wants no part of him or maybe he knows he can't keep his his his creep inside his  personal life personal he probably can't keep that creep once you marry your adopted daughter you  probably have decided not to open yourself up to questioning good points before that though even 
[02:01:30]  before that he was fucking so what what do the uh the sun say about woody not being at the golden  globes or the lifetime achievement award he tweeted miss the woody allen tribute did they put the part  where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age seven before or after annie hall i could answer  that i will because i watched the whole thing no they never mentioned that on the show yeah so i guess  that's taken care of wow and that's like yeah woody's son woody certainly raised him as his son 
[02:02:00]  was that sarcastic though was there like a winky face after that um was there any sarcasm that is  only a question mark uh-huh okay direct all right what is he referring to because i don't even know  the story the girl's name is dylan or was dylan she changed it every time she was an adopted daughter  and back when there was a big custody thing in 92 there had been these allegations that woody had put  his face in her crotch and had done molesty things i don't know exactly molesty things i don't know i i 
[02:02:30]  don't know the exact things that he was accused of but of course he denied it and they fought it out  in court and i had never heard that she spoke about it and then i guess it was in november's  vanity fair which was really fucking recently this i think she finally talked about it and said that  he did touch her inappropriately and i think she was saying that she felt it seems truthful what  she's saying because she's like well he took me into the attic and i think she said he was putting  his hands down her pants or whatever it was and uh how it bothered her and she felt guilty as a kid 
[02:03:00]  like you're supposed to listen to the adults but this didn't feel so again maybe she's a fucking  lunatic and is just believing what mia farrow told her or maybe she's telling the truth but the fact  that it got no traction at all i found kind of surprising well he's beloved i love him american  treasure woody allen national treasure yeah yeah national treasure that put a damper on it though  it becomes difficult tarnish the old treasure a bit wow what's interesting and i think i don't 
[02:03:30]  it's hard because i love the guy so much but when you do something that is like if you if you're  overheard dropping an n-bomb hollywood turns on you but for things like that they're very forgiving  like roman polanski hollywood's forgiving with really weird things yeah well you know at least  he hasn't been exiled from the united states that's true amazing well he didn't run away either well  that's true what did mia say anything yeah she just tweeted time to grab some ice cream and switch  over to girls whoa i guess during the tribute right before she's still not over it you don't think 
[02:04:00]  she would like to sit there and watch her and watch and go like wow that's how great he is he is  great we had our differences but he really is quite honest he's great mia farrow might be a little nutty  but she's fucking does i'll do a lot of nice things for people and she's all helping yeah and she adopts  fucking adopts dates for fucking woody yeah yeah i'd say your uh ex-husband leaving you for the 
[02:04:30]  daughter that you adopted is like probably up there with things that could drive you to the point of  being nutty talk about a woman scorned that's a fucking scorn right there wow that's fucked up  that's gonna make he's fucked up that'll make you crazy he's fucked up and i think the husband  woody's i don't know if it was uh her first husband or whatever it was before who adopted  sunyi said that she's like she doesn't exist to us but it's almost like well sunyi was a teenager  who the fuck knows what happened before that or what yeah remember the guy who heard care hug  wood ye wood ye oh boy do they fuck him over oh did they ever that's right he used to do howard's 
[02:05:00]  show as uh he started doing ours a little bit yeah what was his name again it was really his voice  sounded like that he sounded like woody allen what was his name wait a minute oh i wish i remember  they forced him into retirement early so they didn't have to pay him something yes okay definitely  that's steve from base show i get man he was an engineer at uh k-rock forever remember tim  of course yeah yeah i haven't thought about him in years i didn't realize there he is there's steve 
[02:05:30]  uh-huh oh boy did he motherfuck the company because they made him retire early so they didn't have to  pay him some extra shit uh-huh and he needed that extra shit badly remember oh the tragic stories he  would come up with remember uh remember my wife and this and that his wife's sick or whatever he  needs insurance and they didn't give a fuck they still said bye didn't he have 40 years or something 
[02:06:00]  he was just short of 40 years 40 years is when everything kicked in he used to tell stories  he was trying to hang in there right he would tell early mel so when mel was like a fucking copy boy or  something right and uh there he was just getting fucked what a lousy company by the company he was  like just short of 40 he needed the 40 for whatever right a pension or whatever the hell they were  going to do for him yeah and they decided well we could cut some corners here uh-huh and just 
[02:06:30]  fuck over this guy's golden years 40 years of service or 39 years of service and go fuck yourself  yeah that's why i have no loyalty for any fucking one company yeah it's tough for them to do the  right thing in the end always i have 40 years of service they do that shit good for them i wonder  if he's still alive even you think let's not talk about him see how that works out what what about  pete johnson pete johnson my chin dildo pete johnson he was great another old engineer yeah 
[02:07:00]  from cbs radio fucking radio engineers are the weirdest fucking guys man they're all just  fucking weirdos because they're wired differently they're technology geeks before like everyone  considered themselves you know because you walk around with an iphone you're not a geek believe me  but uh these were old school like they would rather spend their time in an electronics store 
[02:07:30]  going through capacitors and fucking shit like that than then go out just just wired differently  that's all yeah weirdos they knew how to and liked building electronics right solder they love solder  just solder all day oh just solder things on and on fucking board we were talking about um uh governor  christy so julianni uh... is popping up talking about the christy thing no i am yeah this is what 
[02:08:00]  he's saying it's quick he said he didn't realize he said he didn't know i think it's pretty darn  credible he wouldn't make this blanket denial unless uh... he it it it it's not true but i was like  the other thing that i'm sorry we're talking about two different things you're talking you're talking about  him him saying he he didn't know there was any scandal involved in this he had to know there was all that  traffic  well yeah i'm saying to you miss things i mean things happen in an administration things happen  when you're running for reelection  after the fact it seems like how didn't they know 
[02:08:30]  but the reality is you miss a lot of things  when you're running a government that's as complicated as new jersey new york or the united  united states this has happened to many presidents many governors many mayors it's happened to the  present president at least three or four times where he said i didn't know  and then the press says gosh how could he how could he have not have known  she's like what a dumb question she has what about that traffic someone if he heard about  his four-hour delays the gw yeah they're doing some kind of oh there's calling yeah you don't 
[02:09:00]  instantly think hmm something's up you don't immediately investigate spidey senses are tingling  yeah there's delays every fucking day yeah yeah it's not completely out of out of the ordinary at  all no no that's longer than normal but what if there was a structural issue they would fix it you  know yeah so i was from the casual gym casual man whatever what the hell do i know i sit there  i get paid anyway i nip at the lunch pail and traffic that's what i do oh you do yeah i reach  in i pick out a few of the fritos does the wife put in something extra for you she puts in a few 
[02:09:30]  fritos she says now don't buy any more i got whatever honey you talk i listen what do i know  i hate this guy nice thermos full of milk ah well just the thermos full of milk yeah oh look it's  supposed to work i just hope he doesn't uh snarl up the traffic on the pensacola bridge  because what he's down in florida what's he doing down there yeah he's doing some of that endorsing  so a politician had to say that you know yeah yeah get it just having a little fun with it 
[02:10:00]  everyone just tries to make the joke nah man we gotta have the joke and some more  shits coming out oh no more shits coming out i honestly don't know oh yeah and why isn't that  bridget girl uh not talking they probably you know what bridget girl but when he fired his top eight  probably been instructed to um keep her mouth shut while she cooperates with investigators but they 
[02:10:30]  can't like give her a nice package because that looks suspicious so she's fired fired so what would  be her reason uh for keeping quiet well because she looks really bad right now maybe she doesn't get  sued or there's always an investigation going on never good to start blabbing when  you know you play ball crosshairs they help you get a corporate job at like you know what i mean 
[02:11:00]  it's like christy still likes her he doesn't just because you can't hand her cash doesn't mean you  know you can't make a couple calls for bridget and kelly on the day that she sent the now infamous  emails and texts given that they were together in seaside heights responding to a boardwalk fire at  the time now new jersey democrats plan to issue a new round of subpoenas as soon as today  an incoming state assembly boy this thing isn't going away so they were together when she sent that  or in the proximity oh wow come on it come on there's just doesn't seem to be any evidence 
[02:11:30]  pointing toward it i'm all in i'm all in he knew she might have said something to him like there's  going to be some traffic and he might go okay but there's no way to prove that no i know i understand  that and he feels like there's no way that it could be linked till that's why he goes all in yeah  he knew he just knew  politician that can't do no wrong almost a landslide victory 
[02:12:00]  get addicted to that power he's got an ego on top of it  i think he has an ego oh jesus oh jesus  and when can they start drinking the water down there in west virginia yeah what happened there  some chemicals fell in the uh the water 300 000 affected water tests encouraging but no timetable  for water use yeah some kind of chemicals spilled out of a train or some whoops that's pretty bad 
[02:12:30]  i'm sure they uh you got the protesters keep all our toxic away from our water please  i think they do a pretty good job overall occasionally you know you see how many of  those train tracks wind around lakes and rivers and nothing worse than being out in nature like  fly fishing or whatever and going down a river and then you see that big old pipe just pouring 
[02:13:00]  god knows what into the river who thought this was a good idea back in the day  it moves along it moves along the river's rolling  or the brilliant idea of putting a power plant right next to the right next to the water you need  the coolant i know why oh man but can't you bring the water inward oh but then inward then what are you  going to do with it you got to spill it out right spill it back out all right then have another long 
[02:13:30]  pipe going back to where it came from just  they've done a much better job these days with the power plants with everything you look at the  way the hudson used to be and it's uh it's a lot better than it used to be the united states has done  a pretty good job cleaning up um it's more the third world countries that are just emerging into  they're way behind industry that are fucking everything up china so why can't they gotta be 
[02:14:00]  one of the biggest polluters on the fish why can't they learn from us and do it right because it's  expensive expensive right that's yeah you gotta it's again i bring up the sim city games all the  time you gotta level up you can't go right to the fucking clean power plant you gotta pop that smoky  fucking coal one in your neighborhood so then when you check the environment it's all yellow and red  around the neighborhood your water's contaminated your residents are all pissed uh love that stupid ass  game all right we're gonna do some a-rod uh stuff next a-rod yo 
[02:14:30]  not from west virginia wants in on this water man he he's saying that people  wow skin is peeling off people's fingers what thanks to the chemicals in west virginia i have  a lot of info on it that is scott and we have scott on the line what's up scott hey my buddy lives  up there in south charleston he said uh he poured his tap water put his finger in there in about 15 
[02:15:00]  minutes his skin started peeling off his fingers well why would you do that who would do that  well the chemical that that fell in the river it's used for what he's been told to uh clean  the coal off out of the coal mine clean the coal off yeah and i guess they spread the coal down oh  yeah and uh right now he's worried about his hot water heater and his pipes what it's doing to  to that you know i'm sure it's fine yeah just go about your business i wouldn't i wouldn't worry 
[02:15:30]  about your don't mind don't mind pipes i'd worry about your intestines yeah your peely fingers  your peely fingers looking good wow that's uh yeah some lawsuits going to be happening there  he said what they're having shortage of now is paper plates and uh silverware because nobody wants  to use the water to wash your dishes and frozen foods and shit you're not allowed to use your water  they're basically telling you not to right yeah you said the health department has shut down 
[02:16:00]  everything in in charleston what if you barrel it if you barrel your borders  barrel you have such wisdom and then just put it in a bottle in your refrigerator here in new york city  we have the best water yeah that's great they always say how we have some of the best water in  the entire country yeah but man you turn it's just such a weird thing to turn that tap on you like  huh i'm supposed to drink the water out of this this is point b it came from point a and there's a 
[02:16:30]  lot of shit in between that's what i think twists and turns and pipes and how do you know is the water  okay we grew up where that was our only choice if you drink a lot of tap water do you drink do you drink  tap water no i do here never the pipes are old too i think they said the water's the best but the pipes  so some of the pipes are really shitty oh well what do you get from the pipes just probably  you know bite us yeah you get the pipe itis yeah that don't sound i did an 11-year study on new york 
[02:17:00]  city water pipes i conducted it by myself really your conclusion yeah i went door to door and knocked  and they don't the door they said we help you i go we take your pipes your pipes and i write down  the ranchers and i lost the results oh my god the wind blew them away they were on notebook paper how  awful is that uh hey um we're going to talk about a rod we will in a second here but i i look down  here nevada's biggest casinos lost 1.3 billion dollars last year and people are not going yeah 
[02:17:30]  why are they going they're broke they're on that disposable people are broke 1.3 billion but it says  nevada's biggest casinos how many are in that that's not one because probably those big ones  that are all on the but how many like 10 yeah maybe that'd be about 100 million each then good  number how does a casino lose money that just amazes me how's the tangiers doing the tangiers  not good not as the skim not not as good as it used to be um this leads to an article i read that you 
[02:18:00]  know how detroit is completely uh just a mess and falling apart they were predicting what other  cities are going to turn into detroit and on that list surprisingly yeah there's las vegas  turning into the next detroit why what's uh well if the casinos go just imagine what that would do to  that area yeah that's kind of their their bread and butter as they call it can you find that list i know  i didn't ask for it and um but atlantic cities on that list a bunch of these cities that they predict 
[02:18:30]  will be the next detroit atlantic city and nevada were the two that really popped out but there  are a couple others on there of interest uh i'm trying to remember oh yeah there it is thanks sam  what's the list of uh cities that could be the next detroit uh  uh it's an article it's not in our list format that we like ah we love a good list i love a good 
[02:19:00]  list i guess it's any city that uh their industry is failing or out of date um sure yeah urban sprawl  las vegas las vegas atlantic city what about manch vegas no manch vegas is doing manch vegas is  good well scorch left so everything's okay where is he going san diego that's where i've heard  the economy is booming now that he left i'm hearing scorch got a gig i hope so world syndication i wish  nothing but the best for scorch we all do nothing but the best but it's hard to take i don't understand 
[02:19:30]  how we take the from scorch when it's our listeners right that are perhaps sometimes being a little  you know and we've given a lot of a lot of exposure over the years wow yeah that's that's it for the  cities there's more in there well there was one and there's one in portugal macau no man this was  american cities you might have found oh here you go ohio no well the racinos i love that place i got 
[02:20:00]  the market about oh you might have found the wrong article this is horse races and they're legal in  delaware louisiana maine new mexico new york ohio i'm sleepy i'm so sleepy why are you sleeping because  i stayed up late and couldn't get my sleep cycle well that's uh well this is a dead end it is but it just  says cities that are like you know depending on gambling yeah could be the next detroit all right 
[02:20:30]  jeez oh you saw that yeah that's pretty cool a bunch of unfinished condos just uh blowing over in  the wind we got a tornado warning in north carolina wow here there's that house that's gonna cost you  wow that they're just not put together well are they no when you look at it like that  your houses aren't shit it was like a house of cards ah gary indiana should be on the list  gary indiana and who's this lady trucker who are you oh hey tell them lady trucker sent you 
[02:21:00]  gary indiana should be on that list they got the uh mayors selling their houses for a dollar  yeah they're already on they're already detroit yeah that's true we're talking about we're talking  about cities that are doing very well as of now that could turn into the next detroit gary indiana is a  shithole everyone knows it we all know that yeah but the south side of chicago has got the building 
[02:21:30]  deterioration that is part of town from what i hear bad bad you go down there you better just beware  uh some kind one leroy brown yeah all right trucker  oh boy what  keep her between the ditches let's say hi to mike in west virginia mikey mike  hey guys uh the guy reporting that the fingers skin's rolling off the fingers yeah hate to say it 
[02:22:00]  but he's full of shit i knew it i knew this call is coming why is that i think it's a real one it is  real issue that local news it has stopped reporting on it so it's nothing well the guys nothing they're  showing videos of supposedly water catching on fire and the people aren't even putting the flames in the  water to see if it'll catch on fire because they know the water will put the flame out i saw this  one video clip on facebook that was really funny it's this woman and it's serious and she runs the 
[02:22:30]  water in her faucet she lights a bic lighter and she puts just the flame part under the stream of water  right and she goes what kind of water doesn't put out a flame no what kind and she's dead serious  could you send this video she goes i don't know what kind of chemicals they put in here but  you can you could see i got the flame and it's still the fire not realizing like it's the source  that you have to get you know just like the flame itself she has no clue how fire do you know where 
[02:23:00]  we can find that i don't know i saw that video also the facebook but your your fingers are okay  my fingers are okay the only issue was they told people not to drink the water not to bathe in it for  about a day and it shouldn't be hard that's easy for west virginia god how hack are we i know walmarts  everywhere ran out of water but other than that there's no big issue all right all right hi guys thank 
[02:23:30]  you all right guys found it yeah i don't know if i found this from a month ago but uh check this out  funky water i don't know if this is it is it you don't know i know it's going to set the water on fire  but no it's not one that sets the water on fire yeah it's this woman trying to put out her lighter  in water and she's just hitting the flame part with the water saying why won't it put out the fire  see she's an idiot we didn't start the fire there is some kind of one the fire's still going in well 
[02:24:00]  because she lights the lighter oh i see you gotta put out the source you gotta dump the where the fire's  coming out of sure i was looking for it on um on youtube the other day after i saw it on facebook  i couldn't find it so but it was on facebook somebody's got a boom mic outside boom who's  talking about what are they doing filming a movie yeah they're filming a major what's going on where's  the boom mic right behind these guys who the fuck is this here it comes hi sir yo boom you're addressing 
[02:24:30]  the microphone yo boom he's got a little fucking whoa they're filming me they're filming in here oh  i didn't give approval for this that's right that's right over there what the oh kenny's gonna talk to  here open the door all right yes we're a media destination god damn it oh yo boom oh what's

[02:25:30]  kenny he'll pinch who are those guys you're filming those fat cats  now we'll throw our head back and laugh like we're all having fun here oh you get that i can do it again  all right there goes boom that's great ah that looks awful look at that terrible looks like who  the hell would watch they're filming this room for what they can do with it in october yeah exactly 
[02:26:00]  a corporate film here is some of the studio this is our engineering facility all right well the a-rod  one uh went in front of an arbitrator and uh he got his uh suspension reduced slightly oh yeah by  what 40 some odd games maybe is it reasonable well now he's got to sit out 162 games instead of 200  and whatever the it was does he have to show up in uniform and sit on the bench should make him do  that like in school suspension yeah well yeah why do they get to go home and collect their paycheck and 
[02:26:30]  just do whatever the they want i think he should have to show up for every game great with that  big suit up obviously the yankees don't want that but still right that's a real punishment that's a  fucking punishment make him put on his uniform every day and sit on the bench for an entire year  fly all over the country but why not sit there if i was the yankees i go look we're paying you all  this money just because you're suspended we want you at these ballparks wait they have to pay him through 
[02:27:00]  this yeah i'm assuming they do i'm assuming they don't he doesn't get paid okay he's getting  something isn't he getting like two million oh wait just two million it's some i thought he was  getting like 60 million who's paying him the two million yankees all right so we're right okay it's  just not his uh his full salary so for the two million i would sit there and go nope we want you  to fucking suit it up every game i fear no reprisals how great would that be yeah that'd be hilarious  they should make him fucking suit up and go to every shithole in the united states and sit on that 
[02:27:30]  bench just get hemorrhoids from sitting on so many fucking benches oh wow yeah uh people are saying  i think it would be travis actually who knows a bit about baseball that he is done right travis no one's  going to pick him up after this well i mean if the yankees can't get out of the contract he'll have  to stay with the yankees but if they find a way to to say that he violated the the terms of his  deal outside of steroids and they get out of that deal no one yeah no one's gonna no one's gonna pick 
[02:28:00]  him up no barry bonds couldn't find a deal after after he was done with the giants you think i always  found that weird about barry bonds because there were some desperate teams that i'm surprised they  didn't just say it let's get him i think a rod will get another gig you think yeah for a lot less  money i think he will completely disagree and barry bonds had a couple years left in him you think  as a dh maybe i think so yeah go to the american league and dh definitely but no one i mean a rod's 
[02:28:30]  gonna be 39 when he's allowed to come back and he's still i heard 40. he'll be he'll be 39 uh in 2015.  okay uh and then he signed through 2017. right because it was such a good deal and more yankee idiocy  yep uh-huh wow so you think this is it for him he doesn't play ever again well i mean that's if  the yankees can get out of the deal but if the yankees can't do they play him uh it's a lot of  money to just sit on the bench who knows yeah but you make it hurt dress up but we're not using you 
[02:29:00]  the bat boy imagine he's got to just bring the bats in or the ball girl he can just sit there and  throw the ball to people and how great get off the little stool if they could just punish him like  that the grounds crew he's got to do that ymca thing he's got to call the subway races on the big  screen at the stadium and it's the seven train they can do the t-shirt t-shirt guns yeah just 
[02:29:30]  firing the two shirts out into the crowd yeah well seven is shea stadium city field right yeah that's  you take the seven over there yeah that's the one that uh got um that one guy in trouble from atlanta  right talking about the address john rocker john rocker john rocker is talking about how the seven  train was full of homos and black people and got all yeah kind of trouble for being honest 
[02:30:00]  he really lost his mind didn't he certainly did good old john rocker yeah was off his  so uh anthony uh bosch was on 60 minutes last night so what's the connection with this bosch guy  there travis officially let's see one of these biogenesis guy biogenesis and he's claiming he shot  up a rod right in the high end was that after peter gabriel oh he was so confident red ring 
[02:30:30]  that'll be a good genesis joke why'd you look right at me when you said it yeah you really did  let's go to brian in boston uh he's a red sox fan so you know this is his opinion's gonna be a bit  tainted okay what's up brian what up guys hey welcome aboard bry oh uh they definitely should  suspend uh a rod for maybe more than one season yeah absolutely okay this isn't happening 
[02:31:00]  what a great call what but your reason for that he's a douchebag oh okay all right  okay i like how he pulled it all together there at the end oh yeah yeah yeah not that he might be  guilty of the crime no he should be suspended a lot because he's just a douchebag uh-huh  there's not a lot of people that would disagree with you sir he comes across a bit douchey 
[02:31:30]  well no he's definitely guilty of the crime you know 212 games is not enough for a douche like uh  uh hey rug well now it's down 162 so he got 50 games uh knocked off this thing that's fine  oh less less is good okay wait now that's fine yes you said more would be better no um  um you have no idea what you're talking about wow i know i'm fascinated by this 
[02:32:00]  what are you trying to say bright guy what i'm trying to say is that the  socks are going to go uh win back to back  he's so nervous did your brain explode i don't think he's drunk he drunk what happened to you brian  no i'm not drunk i don't drink i don't okay good good good for you god bless you might want to start 
[02:32:30]  yeah yeah give it yeah you think so yeah no you it's it's a good call all right to spend him another  year for being a douchebag all right all right yeah yeah he's okay that it got lowered  or is he yeah are you are you okay yes sir yes i am because  do you want him to get more games or less games are you cool with the hundreds  you want more than the 212 originally well good give more give him more but you said you're okay with 
[02:33:00]  all right prime we're gonna let you go thank you i don't i don't want to be a douchebag i'm sorry  no you're not being a douchebag i think you just got a little nervous i think  we've seen this from time to time it all made sense in your head and then you  you get connected to the guys and all of a sudden you just lose your mind  yeah you didn't plan on being a monumental 
[02:33:30]  yeah okay all right go uh go pass let's go pass oh we'll go pats i do want i do want i do want  i do want the pats to actually go all the way i think it's going to be the pats and the seahawks  i really don't follow tom brady you know you know kind of take over that game you know  just draining the brady talk he's done yeah he's a great quarterback i want somebody else to win  isn't he kind of a douchebag no but if the pats win this year that'd be almost unbelievable they 
[02:34:00]  no one gave him a shot uh at the beginning of the year he has no receivers and then they decide all  right we have no receivers we're going to make an amazing running game if the pats win the super  bowl it would be their best super bowl ever because no one is no one expected them to get this whole  fucking team together i still want them to lose no i i agree with you why isn't anybody uh thinking uh  san francisco huh huh no one no one's no one's liking san francisco that's all right come on out who

[02:38:00]  insulin growth factor one  human growth hormone  and some different forms of peptides  rat all of them bad he's a fucking rash all of the rat and he knew that  yes he did he knew that  mo bag was rodriguez injecting himself with these substances alex is scared of needles 
[02:38:30]  so at times he would ask me to inject you've injected him yes personally personally that whole  scared of needles thing no one likes needles you're talking about but why why is this guy's going to  jail or no  what's this guy's mo why is he doing this what's his motive for being a  fucking rat like that whether you like a rod or not to just have someone come out and spill the beans 
[02:39:00]  like that yeah this guy's worse than a rod trav they caught him so he flipped and he  flipped for what what was he going to do what was going to happen to him well because they they caught  him you know giving illegal drugs to players all right well he turned states and what was going to happen to him  was he going to see jail time yeah so he's not going to go to jail even though he was the guy providing 
[02:39:30]  shit to the po because they wanted to get a baseball player who fucking hits a ball this  yeah this guy this guy's worse than a rod much worse he's got the fucking juice  when's the last time they fucking let the drug dealer go right to go after the client right  yeah that's pretty fucked up so what do we give up the 60 minutes is covering this  shit who gives a fuck yeah he's a baseball player he's not doing what he's doing is has no social  import it is ridiculous that they give this much attention he's like the most popular most you know 
[02:40:00]  player in the league he's suspended from a game from his game  and he can't play the first words out of his mouth mouth were you know what did manny ramirez  take in 2008 and 2009 what were you given what were you giving many ramirez bosh says manny ramirez  came to him at the age of 35 and the next season he nearly doubled his home runs nice ramirez retired  in 2011 after testing positive for doping alex cared alex wanted to know he would study the products 
[02:40:30]  he would study the substance he would study the dosages because he wanted to achieve all his  human performance or in this case sports performance objective and the most important one  was the 800 home run club the 800 home run club which was only going to have one member alex rodriguez  it's amazing that these things help you that much in baseball it just amazes it really is 
[02:41:00]  it's fucking and it doesn't affect your nerves magic it doesn't lead your nerves yeah right it's magic  he remembers one night a blood test was supposed to be done precisely at eight o'clock but rodriguez  was in a miami nightclub so we ended up drawing the blood in the bathroom of this one restaurant 
[02:41:30]  slash bar slash club in the bathroom stall at 8 p.m with the crowd there with the crowd right people  coming in and out of the men's room i take it and you're in a soul with alex rodriguez drawing his blood  yes as crazy as that sounds what were you thinking i'm not getting paid enough  bosch told us he was getting paid twelve thousand dollars a month in cash  he didn't think he wasn't getting paid enough nothing i'm not getting paid enough don't do it 
[02:42:00]  yeah exactly don't do it shut up come back oh he's nice enough to take you to the toilet  he knows how to treat a baseball player by shooting you up in the toilet in the toilet  say hi to josh in new york the phones are lit on this one man josh go ahead hey yeah i bet he's joshing  uh a lot's lawyer on fox and they were interviewing him about stuff that uh like things uh mlb's doing  for bosch in return for testifying uh the mlb is letting him write a book uh the mlb is paying for 
[02:42:30]  uh security his lawyers uh the mlb is going to the district attorney where bosch is being charged for  uh peddling steroids minors and they're asking for leniency yeah they really hate a rod this guy's a  fucking piece of shit they're really just going after uh they're on for everything the mlb agreed  to drop a million dollar lawsuit against this guy too pays legal fees and all sorts of shit so 
[02:43:00]  it sounds like a witch hunt hates fucking a rod sounds like a witch hunt right millions of dollars  in uh lawyer fees that they're covering for bosch thank you sir i gotta go to rob in baltimore  thank you uh let's say say hi to rob rob hey guys how's going this morning they're all right  buddy hey look i think we're missing the point on this yeah the whole thing about steroids is a joke  i mean the steroids should be legal basically what it is it's just testosterone it's a male hormone 
[02:43:30]  uh it's just it's not cocaine it's not heroin you talk about it like some kind of horrible drug  but it's not the only thing it does is help enhance the athlete well i guess that's the problem  they have with it yeah you probably got guys that are 40 years old that have less testosterone than  guys that are 20 or have more you know they don't measure the individual testosterone of the player  it just comes with these laws that all testosterone stop saying that words oh i know another time

[02:54:00]  thanks yeah all right ronnie thank you sir all right and no one listened to my hurricane story  i was a fucking tornado came no you didn't really see it though i already asked i already asked kenny but  i woke up with the wind i thought my windows were going to blow it i fucking put my computer away  but that's not a tornado though it was supposed to be a tornado tornado yeah you would have known  if it was a tornado it was just very windy down there for you no it was a tornado warning a tornado  warning is different than having a tornado though was it an f4 no f5 hall no figure of god i don't 
[02:54:30]  think it was at all was it already here i don't know but i was scared did dusty come over and i dreamt  i dreamt i was in a plane landing in vegas and that the plane was being spun around as we landed  wow like like just uh not end over end but just kind of left right like a frisbee i dreamt i was  landing in a plane that was spinning around and i woke up and i heard and the fucking windows i'm like  these windows are going to blow in on me to freak out i was scared oh i was scared i stood brave with 
[02:55:00]  my cock up against the window and i'm dared nature to take this away kenny anything to add to the  tornado well i got the uh alert on my phone right it says extreme threat alert oh so it says tornado  warning in this area ah okay take shelter now shelter extreme severity immediate urgency certainty 
[02:55:30]  observed right look at it that's pretty scary to get on your phone without a doubt but it didn't  happen is my point right then what happened when the tornado came i don't know i was hiding under the  bed oh kenny because we had a sliding glass door it was like one wall of the uh-huh to go out to the  balcony right and we were on the top floor those are the people that always get killed that's the  ones who get ripped off you guys almost lost me we survived modern survivors it's just not a good 
[02:56:00]  story it's a terrific story i have the evidence to prove when was blowing i tell you my dream  i forgot about the dream part you're in a modern hotel right yeah well it's very close my computer  put it away in case the water blew in the water you have to take precautions you put your computer away  because you thought the windows might break and some water might blow it get into your computer  oh yeah i was sitting right by the window why don't you just move from the window to where 
[02:56:30]  i don't know the part that doesn't have the window the whole room had a window it's like i had the  whole room it was a sliding glass door with the sliding glass door how small was your room that  really i had a sliding glass door took up the whole wall i had two windows i had a suite i had two  uh patios then you could get away from why to go to the living room portion between the side doors  well then what about the bedroom that had a patio too it was two patios enough with the patios what  was it the bed and then you fall out of bed and you're on the patio pretty much yeah well that's 
[02:57:00]  a shitty room then that's a very nice room lapping and lapping and luxury there but you guys got home  safely no uh you beat the odds no no spinny planes no planes canceled that's another story ga what  happened oh a lot of adversity uh-oh adversity yes yeah and what about yeah a lot of discomfort  with the planes well i'll tell you what happened with our flight was canceled what first it was delayed 
[02:57:30]  before it was canceled to la guardia that stinks and due to what uh they said maintenance issue but  kenny pointed out like there's only nine people on the flight so they may have just ixnade wasting  the fuel oh those bastards so we went to jfk and it was an embrayer and i had the nice emergency  roll all two seats to myself and then one second before we take off he comes lumbering down the aisle  i'm like what are you doing he wasn't happy oh i was miserable because i had so much room and then 
[02:58:00]  he just comes down with his big dumb winter jacket on him and lumbers into the passenger seat and  falls asleep with his mouth open like he does i was the worst kenny sleeps with his mouth wide open  i was cramped in a regular seat so i went to the emergency row for the leg room oh i should have  actually just moved to his seat but yeah well you guys should travel together like that that sounds  nice sit next to each other share stories yeah and then you should the cab driver from from kennedy to la 
[02:58:30]  guardia right he didn't believe in the brakes he was frightening right yeah  he was all gas pedal you get one of those guys every once in a while and it really is  horrifying scary it looks like he was horrible he was driving with his right it was like one of those  uh it's a it's a higher cab it looks like a minivan almost no like a van van almost so it's like it  looks like it's top heavy and he's driving with his right hand  fucking whipping down the grand central and it looked like he had picked up his phone 
[02:59:00]  and was texting with his left hand oh wow i kept looking over the thing and he kept looking back  and making sure i wasn't catching all the features that was really scary so now with him looking back  that's not good either as he's flying down the highway that was very frightening right  he survived mania we're survivors yeah we can play a surviving song sounds like a very harrowing  experience people are very lucky oh you want to play uh soul survivor by the first super group asia  oh no why they're survivors though yes asia yeah asia survived nothing the first super group terrible 
[02:59:30]  uh let's say hi to chris in cleveland chris hey what's going on guys hey that uh yg song or whoever  that that rapper was that we talked about a few weeks ago my nigga my nigga through the whole song  like 8 000 times yes i heard that on the radio the other day and they made them change it to my  hita so they went back redid the whole song i wonder if they got a lot of uh my what my hita hita  hita h-i-t-t-a so my song is so hot that they had to do that well maybe there's a radio editor

[03:03:00]  they pretend it doesn't happen they block it out we wrote out a hurricane in greenville north carolina  oh man when it hit the outer banks that was the first we could get and that was scary man  all right man my her my hitter my hitter my hitter thank you sir hitter gotta eat let's go to aldo  in albany aldo all right good morning guys hey aldo um i'm an antibiotic uh steroid user and uh not all of  us uh talk like a complete gabon uh you're talking about those meatheads they call them you sound kind 
[03:03:30]  of stupid yes you do i'm a single man who lives in albany new york so you know okay i'm pretty stupid to  have moved here it's pretty bad here for a single guy but some of us actually have some sort of semblance of  how to speak phonics you know why are you on the steroids oh um i hate my dad um  and uh you know former athlete but right now i'm just a guy i'm over 35 right now 
[03:04:00]  and uh i'm a libertarian and i'm not hurting anybody i can afford it this guy's a kook  yeah you're a kook you're a kook you're a kook all right all right aldo  i see stuck in my head now that song my hitter my hitter my hitter's better  one more track from uh anthony bosch talking about a-rod this is a good one because he talks  about testosterone gummies really bosch says that his records show the days and times of injections 
[03:04:30]  plus when to use skin creams and oral medications six substances on this list are banned one is  testosterone trochies or lozenges bosch also calls them gummies which he says were taken in combination  with growth hormone and all the rest he would put one of these trochies in his mouth probably about 10  15 minutes before game time or as soon as he he he went into the field a player could take it right 
[03:05:00]  before game time and by the time they get back into a locker room after the game and there was any  possibility of testing they would they would test negative they would test clean if you were telling  alex rodriguez to take these gummies a few minutes before the game he's taking these in the locker room 
[03:05:30]  or the dugout that's quite an image quite an image they're so small that you could literally  while sitting in the dugout take it put in your mouth and people could think it's his balls is is uh  either some flower seeds or or or or or a piece of candy or a piece of gum for that matter  just all sit down and have a chew yeah let's go to ronnie in north carolina ronnie hey just like i 
[03:06:00]  said before there's another meathead calling in he needs brain cells well we're happy you called  thank you ronnie i love talking to the guys about their steroid use a lot of guys apparently yeah  taking the old roids we're missing the boat on that one they uh they talk about it on on commercials they  have like the commercials for low tea and what you put it on like a roll-on deodorant or something  see that one yeah but your girl hair or something in bad places i don't know and you're supposed to  keep it away from your wife and kids and shit like that it doesn't sound too safe wife gets a hold of 
[03:06:30]  that she's like i'm blowing you you're feeling a razor stubble on her thighs rubbing it on a box on  our fucking box her clit turns huge right all right we're gonna take a break we're gonna wrap up the  show next with something really good all right we got another meathead that wants in let's see how  to bob in louisiana bob hey there bab hey guys um yeah wait i like the doot toot part 
[03:07:00]  asia sucks how dare you sir oh asia's the lousiest super group there's ever been  no you just continue to pretend that you're hip this is real hipness right here going out on a  limb and saying super group asia rules  listen uh look how full that is so much happened in there 
[03:07:30]  all right back to bob let me know if that doot doot comes back though go ahead bob  all right i'll listen for that too all right uh so anyway i'll listen to dr steve dr steve you  know checked nuts and all like that went down got my test and i had to get on the uh testosterone  shots problem was that the jackass at the at the pharmacy mislabeled it i was taking three times the  amount that i was supposed to take well it was great man because i mean i could bang the 
[03:08:00]  shit out of my old lady was i mean she was loving it to death problem was about a month into it my nut  one of my nuts turned into like basically a sponge i mean you can sit there and squeeze it like like a  gummy bear and it was the worst and uh did that change back yeah did it change back after you got  rid of the testosterone uh no no no it's all up i mean they sit there and play yo-yo in the toilet  when i go take a shit but um oh it just troops down into the water oh yeah one dips the other one 
[03:08:30]  dips and dips it's all up man that doesn't sound good if you sit there your balls could play the tom  toms i don't i don't uh why would you do that to yourself yeah well he didn't mean to take you that  much more oh three times the amount recommended you have a lawsuit my friend well he's gone i guess  because he needed to go squeeze his spongy ball 
[03:09:00]  well poor guy let's see what else we could do here's fun  yeah i think it's just about done we did the rhino uh bill de blasio uh eats pizza with a fork  and knife that i guess is a huge story what a dork he is gotta eat your uh snickers bar that way  though put in a plate with a fork knife save some for later and you just eat it like that  who does that i do what do you use your hands you don't really do that do you huh do you really do 
[03:09:30]  that yeah it's nice that way really because then you don't get your uh all right side felt what  thank you mr pitt you know the best way to eat a snickers bar is i like this i like to clip a nice  thick toenail and i dig it into the snickers bar and then i hold it like a cocktail frank that way  that's good i think if you eat a piece with a fork and knife you don't like eating the 
[03:10:00]  pussy oh that's probably you know what i don't think you like eating pussy if that's how you eat  your pizza there's nothing that gives me any like i don't know why that should be but i think you're  right because you don't like the juices you don't like the juices running down your face you're  fucking just get your face in that slice of pizza that's right fucking lick it yeah the cheese is  dripping exactly yeah and then throw it out the door as soon as you're done open the door and  fucking plant your foot in it it's never nice no it's never nice i love it and uh i think i think we 
[03:10:30]  did everything else man yeah we didn't get the story of the teen cutting off his own penis and  saving his mother while high nice jesus turn that meow meow you give birth to your own monster yeah yeah  that's like the thing you give birth to your own fucking you could have retroactive tumor that killed 
[03:11:00]  you you can have a relatively good life whatever decide to have a kid and then that's you you give  birth to your own killer yeah that's pretty fucked up it's fucked up come on come on all right hold on  we got one more one more meathead call uh billy in myrtle uh beach billy hey how you doing guys all  right yeah i was listening to the one caller about the goofball who basically was odin on his testosterone 
[03:11:30]  treatment people do not know how bad that is for you i mean if you have a deficiency in it that's one  thing okay take it to get your levels back up but yeah what happened to him it can literally make  your body where naturally you won't produce testosterone you end up producing estrogen which  is what women produce uh to what balance it out yeah it will well your body will stop producing it  wow and where it stops producing it or you end up basically producing estrogen instead will you grow a 
[03:12:00]  cunt uh you might very well i have not confirmed that but uh i do know i bet you get some breast  this is definitely you round out your hips a little oh softer less visible facial hair  and uh just a generally softer look a softer appearance right have warning labels on it that  even says that warns people because people are stupid how do you know you mo exactly yeah because i take it  oh what's that what happened uh i actually just my body just stopped producing as much as it should 
[03:12:30]  for whatever reason they've never figured out why i take it because you know you are not the real man  well maybe maybe not but all i know doc told me to take it what's up with the baby what's up with  the high-pitched uh dudes what's that about is that low testosterone levels might be you mean like dan  this is dan uh yeah his voice is a little high right this guy's yeah but i'm just saying in general 
[03:13:00]  what's that high talker when you have the high voice as a guy what's that about i don't know low  levels of testosterone i bet that does it or some kind of genetic voice thing voice box thing maybe an  injury like the leno kid who has his own talk show what's that about ross yeah he's got a very high  voice yeah but he's super playing it up too yeah oh you think he does oh yeah i think it's probably  yeah he probably plays it up because yeah because his voice is very stereotypically homosexual
