<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with typical bizarre, sexually suggestive, and vaguely violent banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  A substantial portion of the show was devoted to a furious denunciation of radio personality Sid Rosenberg, filled with vulgar threats and accusations of backstabbing, substance abuse, and gambling debts.  Their anger stemmed from Rosenberg's negative comments about their show.

The hosts then launched into an extensive discussion about a police shooting in Queens, involving a groom and his friends at a bachelor party.  They presented conflicting accounts from police reports and witness testimonies, focusing on the number of shots fired, a possible attempted vehicular assault on an officer, and the ensuing public outrage, including Reverend Al Sharpton's involvement.  The discussion touched on racial implications, but largely centered on procedural details and the hosts' frustration with media coverage.  Numerous listener calls contributed diverse perspectives to this segment. This section concluded with promotion of the show's upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree" and further discussion of the Queens shooting, bookended by a *Family Guy* clip satirizing stereotypical radio personalities.

A caller's comment about racism sparked a wide-ranging discussion about race and the Rodney King beating.  The conversation explored the complexities of racial dynamics, with one host expressing the difficulty of defending himself as a white person without being labeled racist. The disproportionate number of shots fired by police in incidents involving Black individuals was a key topic, fueled by caller anecdotes and opinions on police procedures and the aftermath of such events.

A particularly heated exchange occurred with a female caller, Tina, who vehemently criticized the hosts' perceived trivialization of racism and demanded reparations.  This resulted in a highly charged and offensive back-and-forth filled with insults and sexually charged remarks from the hosts. The hosts accused Tina of incessant talking, while she accused them of inciting racism.  The juxtaposition of a commercial break for NYPD recruitment immediately following a segment on police brutality was noted humorously.  Further calls included a playful exchange with another caller referencing the challenge to Tina, and a joke about one host's genitalia.  The segment ended with promotion of the "Eggnog Challenge."  Kevin Smith briefly called in towards the end, engaging in lighthearted banter.

A significant segment featured a conversation with Kevin Smith, beginning with his discussion of body image issues, specifically his discomfort with nudity due to his "man breasts."  This transitioned into a debate about Jesse Jackson's proposed ban on the n-word in entertainment.  Smith, Opie, and Anthony discussed the word's contextual use, varying interpretations depending on the speaker, and the potential ramifications of a ban, including the possibility of banning other slurs. Specific movies like *Pulp Fiction* and *Jackie Brown* were referenced, along with differing policies of XM and CBS.  The discussion broadened to other racial slurs and offensive terms, with opinions shared on their usage.  Smith's movie reviews, including his work for Ebert & Roeper, and reviews of *Half Nelson*, *Shadowboxer* (described as "spellbindingly awful"), and the possibility of an *Iron Eagle* revival were also included.  The discussion returned to the n-word ban, its potential impact, and its contextual use.  The segment concluded with promotion of the "Homeless Shopping Spree" and "Eggnog Challenge," banter with a homeless man named Andrew, and a discussion of the Laugh Factory's ban on the n-word and its implications for freedom of speech in comedy clubs.

A significant portion dealt with comedian Michael Richards' racist rant and freedom of speech.  A caller, Jay, discussed the implied protection comedians have from audience violence compared to actors, and noted Black audiences' ability to differentiate between artistic use and gratuitous shock value.  Another caller, Nick St. Louis, debated with Jimmy Norton about Jamie Masada's n-word ban at his comedy club, with Norton arguing that while Masada had the right to set rules, doing so out of fear was cowardly.  This prompted a discussion on the right to say something versus the consequences.  The show included Big Kev's heavily mocked celebrity interviews (Val Kilmer, Adam West, and Catherine Bach) from a comic convention, with Sam providing sarcastic commentary.  The hosts' commentary was laced with personal attacks and offensive jokes about Sam's appearance and race.  Segments from the "Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour," including "Best of the Walkover" and "When the Mics Are Off," were previewed, along with a Kramer rap and Jimmy Nortonâ€™s creepy old-man character bit.

A "When the Mics Are Off" segment showcased unintentionally recorded audio of the hosts and producer Jimmy during commercial breaks, revealing mundane conversations and activities, including eating a pineapple and grapefruit salad and racially charged comments about a Black coworker, Sam. Another segment featured comedian Patrice's highly vulgar and sexually explicit commentary on *King Kong*.  The hosts reacted with a mix of embarrassment and amusement.  Listener calls included praise, criticism of Howard Stern, and various requests, including ringtones based on "Uncle Paul."  A bit about a video of President Clinton with an HIV/AIDS awareness puppet was met with vulgar and sexually suggestive commentary.  Kevin Smith was mentioned again. A listener's "line of the day," referencing *Blackboard Jungle*, won. The show ended with a song, vulgar remarks, and sponsor mentions (Bodog).


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  So, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  And then eventually, everything just stops. 
[00:00:30]  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny? Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb? He he.  O.P. O.P., do you want to play?  Anthony, I will beat children about the hedge.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing. I'm dancing. I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance. 
[00:01:00]  Oh!  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Ha! Ha!  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know. It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the O.P. and Anthony's Joe.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Let's show on road.  Hi.  And you seem like you're in a little bit of a foul mood.  Ah.  A foul mood.  What else is new?  I don't know if the rest of the country is going to understand this, but this radio business stinks.  We love doing radio.  We absolutely love it.  Who wouldn't? It's fun to do. 
[00:02:00]  We just don't like any other radio guy.  There's very few.  They're few and far between.  Actually, I like Brother Wee's in Rochester.  I love Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Who do a show on XM right after ours.  Yeah.  But then you, like, kind of befriend these people over the years.  And then they just end up turning their backs on you for no reason whatsoever.  They turn into scumbags.  Is what they turn into.  Just lackey, backstabbing jackasses. 
[00:02:30]  I've never understood it.  I've never been party to it.  I've never taken part in any of the crap.  But then you just, you read stuff, you see it.  It's just the noise of the crap out of you.  I thought Sid Rosenberg used to be on the Imus in the morning show.  We worked with him for a while at WNEW in New York. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, he was the morning show.  He was the morning show.  Nice enough guy.  I never, you know, never went out to dinner or took warm showers with him.  But, you know, nice enough guy in the hallway.  A few discussions.  Always had something nice to say.  A little chit-chat in the hallway kind of thing.  That's great.  Personally called me a bunch of times when we weren't working.  And then when I kind of befriended Imus, he was like the liaison. 
[00:03:30]  I would call Sid to get to Imus and then Imus would get back to me.  Yeah.  There was no real sign that there was any problems between us and Sid Rosenberg, but out of nowhere he went on Howie's show and trashed us.  Well, he's.  For what reason?  He's.  Is he that desperate?  He's always had problems.  Sid is just full of problems.  Whether it's drug use allegations or gambling debt allegations. 
[00:04:00]  All these things pop up.  And apparently some people know more than I do, and I know a lot, and throw his ass out of wherever he's working.  He's a bum.  He's a bum.  But it's come down to this?  And now it comes down to this where, you know, he's got to drink the Kool-Aid and kiss the ring of that jerk off over there to try to get, you know,  the last bastion of hope for him for a paycheck to perhaps, I don't know, maybe buy more crack with. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know what he's doing with his cash, but from what I hear on the street, word on the street from dependable sources and past history,  I hear things.  I hear secondhand information.  That's pretty reliable.  Hey, Sid, why don't you take a walk in Bay Ridge?  See how long it takes before someone beats the crap out of you or maybe even kills you because of things I hear about gambling debt. 
[00:05:00]  I was just at a bar in Brooklyn over the weekend and hearing about from people, plenty of people.  Hey, Sid, man, geez, that guy took off with eight large from me, and I've never heard from him since.  I hear he's down in Florida or something like they can't find him.  But believe me, they find him.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, get threatening to jump out of windows. 
[00:05:30]  He's got a kid and he's threatening to, you know, jump out a window in tears.  He's the guy is just a cluster F who, you know, I don't even know if I can blame him for his latest tirade.  Maybe he needs more money for drugs.  I don't know.  Maybe he's filming intervention or something.  Yeah, maybe that.  Maybe they're filming the meltdown.  Sid, you're a piece of crap.  Go F yourself. 
[00:06:00]  Don't want to see you or hear from you again.  You're dead.  You're just dead to me.  Sid, you're so brave.  Why don't you give our show a little call?  Yeah, call up, brave man.  Dude, I talked to him when I was in Florida.  He called me and I had called him.  Of course.  He's a two-faced crap.  And he was going to come to the improv and see his show, I think with his wife he wanted to come.  It was during the Mets playoffs.  That's only a month ago, a month and a half ago.  Last time I was down there, we talked.  How was everybody?  Everybody's great.  And it was friendly.  And I was happy to hear from him.  I left tickets when he never came.  I'm like, all right, he's probably watching the game. 
[00:06:30]  And I hear he's bad-mouthing us.  Why?  Oh, bad-mouthing us.  What?  Just put another frigging glass pipe in your mouth, you tool.  Go ahead.  Suck on the big fat glass one.  The business is just filled with asses.  It's just filled with asses.  I could give a crap when it's people that, first of all, I don't know, never met, whatever.  You try to get yourself a little publicity by bashing the big guy on the block or whatever.  That's fine.  It's part of the game.  You take it.  You bash him back. 
[00:07:00]  But then when people that actually were friendly to you and you didn't do one thing to change that, and then all of a sudden they turn around and just backstab you, it's typical radio, first of all.  It's just what always seems to happen with these people when they lose their job.  And not for a big publicity thing.  They lose their job or lose their job over something that will get them a better job, things like that.  You lose your job over the fact that you can't be an adult.  You can't be responsible.  You can't hold down a job. 
[00:07:30]  You can't take care of your kid.  You're doing drugs.  You're gambling to the point where you lose everything in your life.  It's those type of people that will just turn on you on a dime.  Good.  Go F yourself.  Here's my wish for Sid.  Here's my wish.  Either you're found OD'd somewhere or one of these guys that you borrowed money from put a bullet in your head.  There you go. 
[00:08:00]  There you go.  Merry Christmas.  And Happy New Year.  And Happy New Year.  And said Merry Christmas.  I don't know if you heard that.  And I say Happy New Year.  I threw the F-O.  Yeah, you certainly did.  Sorry.  It's so funny because over the years, you know, we get these opportunities to go to, like, boot camp and these places where radio guys hang out.  And we say no every single time.  In the beginning, when Ant and I first started doing radio together, you know, we were too new. 
[00:08:30]  We had to do a few because someone's going to call us out and go, well, weren't you out at the comedy store back in the day with a bunch of other radio shows?  Yes, we were.  But as soon as we got a little juice in this business, we realized, God, we can't hang out with these people.  That'll never happen again.  We can't hang out with these people.  They all stink for the most part.  Come on, Sid.  Give our show a call.  Give our show a call, Sid.  Backstabbers.  I honestly cannot think, and please point it out if I'm in error here, I can't think of one radio personality that I was friendly with that I just turned around and all of a sudden out of nowhere started bashing for my own gains. 
[00:09:00]  I don't, I don't.  Even with the Howard thing, he started that whole stupid thing.  Yeah, even that.  Even with the Howard thing.  We came flying into New York out of Boston and gave the guy all the props and respect that he was due and didn't say a bad word about him. 
[00:09:30]  And all of a sudden we started getting a little ratings, doing our funny dopey little show.  And he was a little upset that somebody right in his backyard was getting a little notoriety.  So all of a sudden we turned into the clones and this and that.  And the same line he used about everybody else, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And that's what happens.  Well, I can't think of one person that I just turned on and stabbed in the back because of this stupid, stupid business.  You know, I was laying in bed over the weekend watching, had to be three different shows. 
[00:10:00]  One was Family Guy.  I think another one was The Simpsons.  And then another one was â€“ it wasn't a cartoon.  It was another show.  But all three of them showed radio personalities in just this hysterical, cliched light where it's just nothing but two dopey guys with radio voices doing stupid breaks about nothing and hitting the one sound effect of the passing gas or a couple of movie clips. 
[00:10:30]  And it was just like I started laughing and I turned to my girlfriend and I go, I am in a cliche job.  It is just a job full of cliches where you just make fun of the â€“ the people in the business make fun of the same crap, the same sounds, the same dopey voices.  And you realize the whole job and business is a goof.  And then you throw in these scumbags that just have to turn it into, you know, a backstabbing. 
[00:11:00]  And you actually think there's going to be maybe a little something a little different where someone like Sid, who you've had conversations with, sat down, maybe shared a beer with or something like that, and then just out of nowhere turns around and bashes us.  Go screw.  Go overdose.  Could you please overdose and do the frigging world a favor?  And all these guys make the same mistake.  They go over there and they trash us or somebody else thinking Howard gives a crap in the end.  He doesn't give a crap about you, Sid. 
[00:11:30]  Stop. He's got his own problems over there.  Trust me on that one.  Please just trust me.  He's got his own huge problems over there.  Pharrell did the same thing.  It's like we were friends.  Everybody hung out.  There was no problems with Scott Pharrell.  We liked the guy.  He supposedly liked us.  And then he just starts trashing us on his website and then goes on Howard's show and just starts trashing the show.  It's like, why do people think they have to do that?  Because it's another desperate â€“ it's a desperate move.  There was another guy.  Can't hold a job.  He's run his course in broadcast radio. 
[00:12:00]  He's burnt all â€“ these guys are known as bridge burners, both of them, total bridge burners.  And there's no one left.  So they had to crawl over there, kiss the ring, probably make nothing to sit there and just do a commercial for him for whatever hours they get over there.  And now I guess Sid is begging for a job over there.  Good luck to you.  You know who I have a huge respect for?  Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer was a huge part of the show. 
[00:12:30]  When we got back on radio, we were trying to get him involved with XM.  And he decided it was best for him to go to the other company, which was a real bummer for Anthony and I and Jim Norton.  Would have loved to have had him.  We would have loved to continue with Jim Brewer.  He did some great radio with us.  But he wanted to make it on his own, and he felt this was the right move for him.  And we were bummed.  But he went over there.  He hasn't trashed us.  He doesn't go on Howard and trash us.  He's just doing his own thing, building his own radio show.  And I respect that. 
[00:13:00]  You don't have to, like, all of a sudden turn on, you know, your supposed friends in the business to better yourself.  No.  Unless you have a real beef.  But to make up these fake beefs out of nowhere to try to, you know, to better yourself is ridiculous.  He actually said good things about you guys.  Not just the opposite.  He actually said good things about how you guys taught him a lot about doing radio.  He did nothing but say good things since he's been over there.  He's never once been a scumbag.  He's a great guy, man.  He's not a scumbag.  Grr.  Uh, let's say hi to Steve on Long Island. 
[00:13:30]  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Steve.  It hasn't even been, like, 15 minutes.  Can't you go one day without talking about Howard?  That's funny because in all actuality, I don't think we've even said a peep about him in months.  Speaking of Howard, did one of his fans, like, smash one of our fans' windows in because they had a wow sticker?  What's that about?  Yeah, that's what I've, uh.  What is that about?  And I'm also hearing, and Ant's not going to, you know, say it on the show, but behind the scenes, Ant turned around and did the right thing and paid for a window or something? 
[00:14:00]  He had a guy, not a rich guy.  Ant's not a fan of the show.  He's got wow stickers on his car.  And the desperation that is coming out of that camp over there is blatantly obvious when, you know, what is supposed to be an adult audience is throwing bricks through people's windows that have stickers on their car that support this show. 
[00:14:30]  How do we know one of his fans threw a brick through one of our fans' windows?  They put a sign.  They put a note.  They put a note?  They left a note.  Yeah.  It said Howard Stern written on paper.  On some type of loose-leaf paper.  What a tool.  So, uh, yeah.  Throw a rock through the guy's window.  The guy just, you know, listens to this show, supports this show.  None of our guys, you know, fans are doing stuff like that.  You know, not destructive. 
[00:15:00]  Have fun with it.  It's a dopey radio show.  Relax, people.  I guess the Howard fans are getting really frustrated that the wow stickers are appearing more and more lately.  Gotta be.  You know, we're doing Letterman.  We're doing Leno.  Magazines.  You know, I'm sure it's gotta be frustrating for the few but dedicated fans that went over there to listen to him.  It's gotta be upsetting.  So they take it out on the fans.  And one guy got his back window blown out. 
[00:15:30]  But, um, you know, he's just a regular working Joe.  And Anthony doesn't pat himself on the back.  Anthony, behind the scenes, ended up paying for the guy's window.  It just annoys me.  It's like an annoying way, you know.  It's just a bunch of friggin' idiots.  All right, let's go to Joe.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey, Ant.  You sound like you're getting down on yourself, bro.  You guys got the best damn radio show ever.  I was a long-time Howard listener. 
[00:16:00]  I listened to you guys back then.  When you guys get on the radio, man, you guys make better points.  Who gives a crap about that other guy?  And these guys are throwing bricks.  I'll tell you what.  I swear, if I ever see Howard ever, I'm going to throw a brick right in his face, man.  How's that?  Oh, sir, that never solved anything.  Yeah, it doesn't solve nothing.  But, come on, it would be funny, wouldn't it?  Yeah, it's always funny.  Anyone with a broken nose?  Come on.  When anyone gets a brick thrown at him, it's funny. 
[00:16:30]  Who wants to get it anyway?  All right, Joe.  Punch it out, man.  Don't be able to tell yourself that.  Anyone with a broken nose is funny.  Geraldo with that chair on his face.  Or Fabio when the bird hit his nose.  When he was on the roller coaster.  I cannot look at Fabio now without thinking of that bloody nose and his eyes going cuckoo,  cuckoo around his head.  And the big bloody spot and the dead bird in his lap.  Anybody who gets bricked in the face, rule of thumb, laugh riot for those around.  Funny, unless it's you.  Make sure you point and laugh. 
[00:17:00]  Don't just laugh, just point and laugh.  You got a brick in the face.  It's funny unless it's you or your date.  Because now instead of going home and unloading like you, we were supposed to get taken to the hospital  and have her teeth sewn back in.  And she expects you to defend her instead of laughing.  All right, we got lots to do today.  Lots to do.  I just knew Ann was a little bummed out.  I should say bummed out.  I really, really don't.  I wasn't close enough with Sid to be bummed out.  To tell you the truth, it wasn't like we had a close friendship. 
[00:17:30]  But it was one of those things where never a bad word was said.  And it was just nice pleasantries in the hallway.  And again, an occasional beer or something like that.  And then just to turn around, there goes this stupid radio knife, just like it always does  in this dopey-ass crap business.  He was asking for you guys when I was in Florida.  We were talking.  We had emailed each other a few times.  I was supposed to do a show, but I kept missing it.  And it was always good stuff.  How are the guys doing?  Tell my sister hello. 
[00:18:00]  It was never anything negative.  Well, good.  Whatever.  Now all of a sudden the show sticks.  Take a big, just take a big drag of some crack.  Sid, crack.  It's so good.  Just take a big hit until your heart explodes.  Could you do that?  Do the world a favor, you scumbag.  There you go.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony Show are appearing in

We found that clip you were talking about, Anthony.  Oh, one of them from Family Guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Making fun of this stupid business we call radio.  Yeah.  It's easy.  Like you said, we're in a business of what, cliches? 
[00:19:30]  Cliches.  Yeah, it's just a cliche business.  We really do try on a daily basis to do something a little different.  Try.  I wouldn't even say a little.  We try to be much more different than any other radio show out there.  We try.  We really do.  Just hang out and try to carry on real conversations.  That's, there's a plus.  How about not throwing on a dopey radio voice?  We try to stay as honest as possible.  Yeah.  We really do. 
[00:20:00]  And then you got Family Guy making fun of the business and you can't help but laugh, but  then you realize it's also very, very sad.  Oh my God, I work in this business.  Like I was laughing my ass off because it's every cliche.  Yeah.  And then you go, oh my God, I work in this stupid business.  Yeah.  Well, here it is from Family Guy.  Hey everybody, it's Weenie and the Butt here live at the Quahog Air Show.  We're all ready for the Weenie Soundalike Contest.  I don't know, Butt.  I don't think they can say my catchphrase because they no funny. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, there it is.  And if you think you can say that just like Weenie here, you could win $97.1 for the  Cool Weekend Ahead.  We have a butt.  We, we, we have a butt.  Cool weekends in the morning.  97.1 at 10.  Weekends in the morning with a Weenie in the butt.  W-H-G, 97.1.  97.1.  97.1.  We, we, we, we have a butt.  In the morning.  Bad production.  Cool weekends.  Seven.  Weenie.  Weenie.  Weenie.  And a butt. 
[00:21:00]  All that bad production.  Hey, okay, we, oh, my God.  And there are stations.  They no funny.  He's got his catchphrase.  And there's a million of these stations.  A million.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what city you're listening to us in.  You know the stations.  And they're all doing this.  And they have no idea how ridiculous they sound.  They really think they're getting something done with all that crap.  You know how many of these awful shows I've had to do on the road?  You guys don't have to go on these shows.  I've had to go on my rotten gigs.  Oh, yeah, funny, man. 
[00:21:30]  Jim Norton here.  Jim, funny, man.  And they pop up the mics.  Flick, flick, flick, pop.  Pop, pop, pop, flick, flick, flick.  Go, Jim.  Time for you to bring on the funny.  Yeah, just you and one guy.  There's nothing worse than all one guy.  He's in one market, and he's miserable, and he's afraid you're going to say something  to get him in trouble.  Yeah.  Radio is filled with a bunch of bullshit.  But they act like they have edge.  That's the beauty of it.  They're all, like, terrified of their own shadows.  But all their production around them makes it sound like they're the crazy show. 
[00:22:00]  Life on the road, Jimmy Norton.  Do you miss your home?  Is that an issue?  No.  Die.  Okay.  This comedy minute was brought to you by the Chuckle Haunt.  Comedy minutes.  Just stinks.  Everywhere you go, you've got to go in and do these awful shows.  Like, no, this is a big show here.  It couldn't be.  We have Jim Norton in for our 5 o'clock funnies.  Do ya?  Do ya.  Well, they get paid by the clubs, a lot of these guys, to have the comedians on.  So no matter who the comedian is, they will take the comic. 
[00:22:30]  They'll take the comic.  What do they get, 50 bucks or 100 bucks?  I don't know what the club pays them.  But a lot of these places...  Really?  Is that a form of payola?  So wait a minute.  Maybe it's an advertisement.  I don't know.  Who knows, yeah.  So Gallagher is coming through town.  They have to take him?  Yeah.  Or guys that aren't even famous like Gallagher.  At least Gallagher's famous and you can make fun of him.  Oh, so you're talking about guys that are doing the same type of Gallagher humor, but  they're not even famous.  How great would it be to have an intern or somebody else sneak up slowly behind Gallagher  as he's on the air and smash his head like a watermelon with a big giant mallet? 
[00:23:00]  In mid-sentence, Gallagher's head goes flying across your studio.  I gotta be honest, I like the anger today, Anthony.  Oh.  Loving the anger.  Just had it.  Well, there's part two of the Family Guy skit.  Hey, okay, we've got our first contestant.  Let's hear Weenie's catchphrase.  Danophony.  I think we have a wiener.  And that's Dickie the Punchline Donkey on 97.1. 
[00:23:30]  Dickie the Punchline Donkey on Cool 97.1.  Cool weekend.  On the radio.  In the morning.  FM.  Cool.  WQHD.  Cool weekends.  In the morning on 97.1.  97.1.  And Weenie and the Butt are just sitting there, like staring into nowhere as all these sounds  are playing.  Right.  Not even looking at each other.  We wanted to change our name to, what was it, Rape Kit and Crawl Space? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, Rape Kit and Crawl Space.  Do we still have those jingles for Rape Kit and Crawl Space?  Yeah, we figured we needed some really outrageous name.  So, you know, we used the wacky production, but we had, you know, killer names.  Rape Kit and Crawl Space.  In the morning.  Hey, how you doing today, Rape Kit?  But that would be the problem with, you know, you'd have a really cool name, but you would  still have the wacky radio.  Yeah, the Void.  I'm Rape Kit. 
[00:24:30]  That's Crawl Space over there.  Crawl Space where they are.  We're outrageous.  They talk to you normally before you go on?  Yeah.  Yeah, so you're doing the club this weekend?  You know, pot off the mic, pot, pot, pot, pot, pot, pot, pot, all the buttons.  You know, yeah, you've been around?  Yeah, okay.  You're on.  Okay, here we go.  You're just talking to me three seconds ago.  Here we go.  Jim Norton is going to be appearing this evening as a blah, blah, blah.  And then they read about our success and they get jealous.  It's like, dude, look at yourself in the mirror. 
[00:25:00]  You're a hack.  You're a hack.  A cliche.  You're a cliche.  Using the fake radio voice with a ton of production that doesn't mean crap.  Make him believe you're edgy, but you're not.  You're scared of your own shadow.  The boss tells you, you know, don't do that anymore.  You go, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Sorry about that.  Never again, never again, never again, never again.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Work within the guidelines.  All right, let's move on. 
[00:25:30]  Well, it's like I was pitching my new thing, Health Break Tuesdays.  Oh, I like that.  I have a health break.  Nice.  Yeah.  New feature of the Opie and Anthony show.  Health Break Tuesdays.  Obesity Breast Cancer, Link, stumps docs.  That's right.  Odd terminology.  They're stumped, yeah.  They said that women who are obese are almost 30% less likely to develop breast cancer.  Why is that?  They don't know. 
[00:26:00]  Harvard doctors don't know why.  Big fat pigs are less likely.  Maybe they die of some other disease, heart disease or something before they get breast cancer.  Stats are very misleading.  Yeah.  Or maybe you're so fat that it's stomach cancer but your body thinks it's your breast because it has no idea where one starts and the other stops.  I have no idea.  Oh, if you have an idea out there, why don't you give us a call?  Hey, let's say hi to â€“  Health Break.  Thanks for the health break.  Oh, you're welcome.  Just a little something to help the community.  For the ladies.  Let's go to Sal in New York.  Sal, what's up? 
[00:26:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Sal.  Hey, Sal.  I just want to give one shout-out.  You're talking about Jim Brew.  He's from my town.  He went to Central via Valley Stream Central, and he's like a local legend.  Yeah, Brew's a good guy.  Yeah, I also want to ask you guys, what did you guys take on, you know, the guy who got shot and cleaned from all the cops?  Yeah, it seems like all of America is talking about this.  I was reading the Chicago Sun-Times.  They're all over it.  The Boston paper, all over it today.  Jury's still out.  You know, what are you going to do?  Everybody wants an answer right away. 
[00:27:00]  They've got to do an investigation.  Got to see what happened.  Everyone says it's excessive.  Well, why don't we explain this story?  Because maybe there's a few cities that don't understand this one.  Who the hell ain't heard this one?  That's what I...  Well, you never know.  There's a bunch of dummies that listen to us.  Yes, you.  I was talking to you.  Apparently, a bachelor party was leaving a club.  Black gentleman.  In Queens.  Yeah.  And as they were leaving, there was a sting operation going on that had been going on for months in the strip club at the same time. 
[00:27:30]  So some undercover cops were in there.  And undercover backup team was outside the club.  What were they looking for in the club?  Underage prostitution.  Underage prostitution and drugs.  This, they say, is all the response from that girl that was killed leaving the bar.  Kind of trying to make the bars a little safer.  Okay.  Things like that.  So they put undercover sting operations in some of these shadier bars.  And when there was a little altercation inside between one of the undercover cops and a gentleman who had come up to the undercover cop while he was talking to what he thought was a prostitute. 
[00:28:00]  And he said something to the effect of, don't worry, lady.  I got your back or I'll take care of you.  And padded his waistband as if he had some kind of a weapon in there.  So the cop communicated to his buddies outside that he thinks there's a guy with a gun in here. 
[00:28:30]  So that kind of started the whole thing rolling.  They go to leave the club.  And as they leave, they're followed out by this bachelor party.  Some type of words are exchanged.  They're not quite sure they're still sorting that out.  But at some point, the police in the backup van pulled in front of the bachelor party's, one of the bachelor party's cars to stop him from moving. 
[00:29:00]  Cops got out and identified themselves as police officers, at which point one of the cars from the bachelor party went to run over the cop.  That's the cop side of the story.  Someone else yelled, gun, and shooting started.  Now, once you get especially two different squads, the guys that were inside the place, guys that are outside, so they're not in direct communication with each other. 
[00:29:30]  And you start hearing gunfire, and you think it's coming from the bad guys, all hell breaks loose.  You start opening up on anybody that isn't your friend in that situation.  And apparently, three of the bachelor party got hit.  The groom was killed.  And there's a huge investigation going on now, whether it was excessive force. 
[00:30:00]  Fifty shots were fired.  One of the officers, a 12-year veteran.  Shot 31 times.  Shot 31 times.  He threw another magazine in his pistol and started firing away on that one.  But, again, when all you're hearing is bang, bang, bang, and it's not stopping yet, and you've already exhausted all your rounds, you're going to throw in another clip, you know, and start taking some shots.  There's outrage.  Reverend Al is outraged.  Jesse Jackson's outraged. 
[00:30:30]  The mayor is with Reverend Al, which I think is a travesty.  The mayor should not be meeting with Reverend Al.  If he has to, meet with Jesse Jackson.  But even that, I think the mayor should stay out of this until more of the facts are in.  So he's already saying, it looks to me like excessive force.  In that situation, until the investigation's done, it's very hard to tell.  He's just wishy-washy, Bloomberg. 
[00:31:00]  He's very wishy-washy.  Wishy-washy is a great way to describe it.  He's very, very wishy-washy.  But now until all the facts are in, the police have agreed to testify now without immunity.  So they apparently are thinking, you know, they did nothing wrong.  The ruling here usually is if the police officers feel that they're being threatened,  them or their colleagues' lives are being threatened,  they have the right to use deadly physical force. 
[00:31:30]  Whether the threat was real or just perceived, they have the right to use deadly physical force.  So that's going to be part of the investigation,  whether they felt that them or another officer's life was in danger when the shooting started.  Did the bachelor have a gun in the end?  No, he didn't have a gun.  Nobody that was shot had a gun on him.  There was an original guy, and they're not sure if he was with the bachelor party or not,  that padded his waistband inside the place that disappeared. 
[00:32:00]  They haven't been able to find him.  Whether he had a gun or not, they don't know.  But again, if the car was being used as a weapon, that's deadly force.  They could use deadly force on somebody if they're trying to run you over the car.  They're saying that that's just a story, that that never happened,  that they never identified themselves as police officers.  So it's one of these things where there's really two different sides based on the bachelor party side and the police side. 
[00:32:30]  Where does Kramer stand on this issue?  Kramer?  On this issue, yeah.  I think is with the police.  I haven't really...  I don't think I've heard his statement yet.  Yeah.  But I do think we have it.  I'm not siding with the...  Jerry.  But they didn't find a gun which has people's eyebrows up a little bit.  But again, you don't necessarily... 
[00:33:00]  No gun?  You don't necessarily need to actually have a gun to use deadly physical force.  There can be a perceived threat, and you're still justified.  That's happened before in just people in their house.  Right.  You know, they've shot people that never had a weapon, never intended on robbing them.  And they've killed people, and the grand juries found that they thought their life was in danger.  And with all the facts in, a jury decided, yeah, you know, something, me put in that situation, 
[00:33:30]  I would have thought I was going to be harmed at that point.  And so the guy was justified, even though the guy didn't have a gun or a weapon or never intended on harming him.  If you feel a perceived threat that deadly physical force is going to be used against you, you can use deadly physical force.  So when the shooting started, what did these guys do?  Did they try to leave in their car?  Were they using the car as a weapon?  Yeah, that's what happened.  They started...  The cop's side of the story, again, I don't know. 
[00:34:00]  The cop's side, so far, from what info is out, they're saying that they were using the car as a weapon.  One of the cops was in front of the car, drew on him, and said, stop, police, identified himself,  and the car lunged forward and tried to run him over, and then backed up and then went forward again to try to hit him again.  Cop's side of the story.  So that's when all hell broke loose.  And again, you can't... 
[00:34:30]  When you've got so many cops involved, you can't just count bullets.  It's kind of, you know, it's silly when you have this many cops involved to say 50 shots.  It's like one guy with a 50 cal just opening up, you know?  And then you get Reverend Al just counting.  One!  Yeah.  Reverend Al, regardless...  Two!  Regardless of the innocence or guilt of the officers in this case, Reverend Al is a race-baiting jack-off.  He jumps into these things for his own publicity. 
[00:35:00]  He doesn't care.  It's only black issues.  The guy will never get behind a cop that has been shot by a gang of blacks.  I never see him at the hospital visiting a police officer that was shot.  The guy's a race-baiter.  He uses this, and he'll just run to the side of the family and want to get in every single shot,  and he becomes the unofficial official spokesman for everybody, 
[00:35:30]  and it's disgusting that this guy, that's his job.  All right, let's say hi to Mike in Queens.  Mike, what's up?  The media has to...  Hold on, Jimmy.  Hold on.  Mike.  Yeah, the funniest thing about Bloomberg is he doesn't even spend weekends in the city.  He treats it like it's his office.  He was in the Bahamas again this week, and that's why he was nowhere to be found all week,  and then he flew in yesterday, started shooting his mouth off.  He leaves here Friday or before, goes to the Bahamas, plays up, lives in his real house,  and then back here Monday morning like he's working at 9 to 5. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, Bloomberg should have just kept his mouth shut until there's an investigation.  There's going to be an external investigation.  Deal with it.  Don't jump up and the first thing you say is it looks like it was excessive force.  You don't know.  Of course, on the outside, it can look like that, and it looks like that, whatever.  But he's not...  He didn't investigate this.  No, wait.  He said he has made his investigation, though. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, hasn't he?  I interrupted you.  I'm really sorry.  Well, we got the Bloomberg statement here.  Here's what the Queens DA had to say, that his investigation will be fair and impartial.  That ended a day where we saw Sharpton and other community leaders visiting with Mayor Bloomberg  to talk about what happened early Saturday.  The mayor has said it appears to him the undercover officers used excessive force  in firing 50 rounds at Bell, who was killed, and his two friends, who were wounded.  The officers had suspected, though, that one of the men had a gun. 
[00:37:00]  It sounds to me like excessive force was used, but that's up to the district attorney to find out.  And I do not want to prejudice their investigation.  The mayor went on to say that Bell and his friends were unarmed at the shooting right there  outside the Gentleman's Club in Queens.  As for the five undercover officers, they remain on administrative leave.  And the cops were black and Puerto Rican, right?  Yeah, I think they were multicultural. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, really?  It was like a Sonny D investigation?  Sonny D.  They fired up a few rounds, went to the fridge, and got some Sonny D.  It was a black cop, a Puerto Rican cop, and a white cop.  An Asian cop in there?  That would have been nice.  Maybe an Asian cop.  A Sonny D investigation.  This guy Malik is saying, and this isn't a race issue, because the cops were black.  One of them was black or something.  Malik.  Yo, eh.  Yeah.  Well, what up, yo?  Malik, the Post mentions the race. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, I'm just saying it's a race issue because Reverend Al is in there and because the victims  were black.  That's why.  Yeah, but how do you say it's a race issue if the two cops were black and Puerto Rican?  That's what the question is.  Yeah, I know.  Why are they mentioning it in the paper?  Who cares?  No, you're right.  It's because the victims were black.  I think, I don't think Reverend Al...  It wasn't even that the victims were black, bro.  It was that you had undercover cops that, first of all, they didn't justify who they were,  and then they let off 50 rounds? 
[00:38:30]  Bro, you got a fast car that you drive fast on the LIE or wherever you drive.  Now, just imagine that you didn't see a cop siren going on, and they start spraying your  car.  That's just plain injustice, Ant.  There's no way you can cover it up.  Start spraying the car.  But, look, I'm not going to make any judgments until there's an investigation.  I'm just saying that a cop, I'm not saying in this case, I'm saying police officers have  the right to use deadly physical force when they feel their lives or the life of another 
[00:39:00]  police officer is in danger.  That's the law.  They have the right.  But don't they have to be right, though?  Like, they have to admit that they're in danger.  No.  They have to have a perceived danger.  It doesn't have to be a real danger.  If a grand jury, if they go before a grand jury and plead their case and say, look, I honestly  thought, to the best of my knowledge and with everything I've learned in my training and  everything else, that my life or the life of my partner was in danger at that very moment, 
[00:39:30]  it doesn't matter if it really was.  Does not matter.  How about if they shot somebody who was running and they didn't, they shot him only because  it was raining and they didn't want to get out of the car and run?  All right.  I'd agree with that.  You can absolutely shoot.  Those drops can kill you if you get outside.  You could catch a death of cold.  And I've been reading that the NYPD is not supposed to be shooting at cars or is what's  what's that about?  I would think it's probably dangerous to pain in the ass, innocent bystanders. 
[00:40:00]  If a car is zooming down the street and you're taking pot shots at it, I don't know.  But I believe if you're drawn on a side window telling somebody to get out of the car, maybe  Kenny would know better than this.  I think a driving vehicle.  But I think if a car is stopped and you draw on the window and tell the guy get out, I'm  not sure.  Again, if you're if there's a threat where you perceive a threat against your life, I think 
[00:40:30]  you can use deadly physical force there.  Yes, Kenny.  I was asked for some, you know, input on this vehicles.  Yeah.  Generally speaking, you should never shoot at or from a moving vehicle.  Well, that's cowboy.  Right.  Out west, though, down in Texas.  They love it.  They shoot tires out, my friend.  What's the rule on perceived threat?  I think you would you say to go before a grand jury. 
[00:41:00]  But wouldn't you have to completely justify what the perceived threat was?  Like, it better make sense.  Like, you can't just say, look, the guy, you know, you have to make it seem like, you  know, you were you thought you were going to die.  Yeah.  The correct legal term is eminent danger.  Eminent danger.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  No bad news today for us.  I told these guys I had more to say.  Oh, no.  No, it's easy to second guess a Monday morning quarterback, everything. 
[00:41:30]  But when, you know, when we're talking about dead people and 50 shots, not a pass that  didn't you have to second guess it, Kenny, you know, they might turn out to be right.  But you can't just fire 50 shots.  Have nobody go.  You know why?  No use crying over spilt milk.  Guy throws a simple cliche on a deadly shooting.  But the entire country is disgusting.  A bird in the hand.  The cops do a terrific job every day.  I think it's one of the most difficult jobs in the country. 
[00:42:00]  And, yeah, they do, for the most part, a great job.  Until you walk a mile in their shoes.  All right.  Flatfoot.  Beat it.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah, listen, one of the greatest things about your show is how blatantly honest and there's  no no spin on anything.  But listen to the Michael Richard story and listen to your spin on this.  You guys are waving the flag from the white grandstand again.  OK.  And what did what was said?  I'm just talking about the law. 
[00:42:30]  I'm not even talking about this situation.  I said until an investigation is done.  But I'm just saying what the law is and what the cops are claiming and what the bachelor party  is claiming.  How am I waving a flag, sir?  Just that I just noticed that each time there's a question about it might have gone this way.  It might have gone that way.  You usually spin it the other way.  That's all.  I said the cops.  How many times did I say and the car lunged forward?  I go, that's the police officer's story. 
[00:43:00]  I go, no, there weren't any guns found.  I was stating what's in the papers, the facts that I've read online on news sites, what I've  heard from public statements that have been made by some of the people and lawyers involved  in the gutter, the stupid mayor.  What do you mean waving the white flag on the Michael Richards thing?  How are you supposed to handle Michael Richards?  Same story.  I listened to the whole tirade on Friday.  I wanted so bad to call and I understand it.  But you guys spoke about Michael Richards as though you guys were on stage. 
[00:43:30]  Were you one coat of paint from dropping the end bond if a bunch of black guys in the stadium  started threatening you like your show last week with what's-his-face, the rapper?  Oh, flavor, flavor.  Yeah, you're always going to wave that flag.  Hey, listen, I'm in your suit.  I'm in the same boat.  But after a while, it starts to sound like this show is pure white and I'm black.  God, thank God for Patrice O'Neal.  What are you talking about?  Should we just unleash it?  White power!  White power!  White power!  White power!  White power!  White power! 
[00:44:00]  The guy wants it.  I mean, we might as well just unleash it.  All right.  Sir, I think we're being very factual here.  Yeah, you might want to go wake up with Whoopi.  No, no, no.  Oh, well, that's...  Or, you know, Austin.  Or Austin Powers.  Wake up with Whoopi.  All right, Rob, thank you.  All right, thank you.  Well, listen, we're going to continue with this.  I mean, the phones, look at this.  It's a very heated debate.  The phones are lit.  We got more audio.  Yeah, don't go anywhere.  No, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way. 
[00:44:30]  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall, maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden funds is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:45:00]  Bye.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yes, it is.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Talking about the bachelor party shooting.  Phones are lit.  More audio.  The community reacts.  They shot him a lot of times.  For what reason?  They were trying to kill him.  They killed his friend.  So I guess they say, okay, I killed his friend.  Let me kill the rest of them so I don't have no witnesses. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, stop.  Okay, look.  What a dummy.  Look, I understand people are upset with this whole thing.  But you can't just throw all reason out the window.  Do you honestly think this is a goddamn Scorsese movie?  That they're shooting everybody to get rid of the witnesses?  Stop it.  That's someone who's watched way too many freaking likes.  This is a case of friendly fire.  It's friendly fire. 
[00:46:00]  There's not much difference out there when the cops are in this situation than there is in a war.  And it can get very, very confusing when bullets are flying and you really think your life is in danger.  These people aren't superhuman.  They're guys with families that want to go home at night.  And they're getting shot at or think they're getting shot at.  You're hearing bullets flying.  They're taking cover and shooting at what you think is the threat.  And at that point, you see your friends, your other officers standing there drawing on people. 
[00:46:30]  You have to assume that they're the people that are doing the shooting.  If they're wrong and they're wrong in a way and it's neglectful and stuff, then they're going to pay.  But to say something like that is as ridiculous as they feel the police statements are.  More so.  None of these guys have any shootings on their records.  None of them are like guys that have had problems like this before.  No. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Happens.  None of them have problems.  But let me tell you a little bit about a couple of the guys that were injured.  They're all college students.  Fine young men.  No.  All records, drugs and weapons.  And armed robbery, one of them.  Yeah.  And armed robbery.  But that doesn't mean they should be shot 50 times, Anthony.  I'm not saying that.  That's what I'm going to tell you.  I'm not saying that.  But they're also not telling us that.  That isn't splashed all over the paper.  You know, of course you shouldn't be executed for crimes you've committed and may have, I don't know what the circumstances, paid your debt to society for. 
[00:47:30]  But, you know, drugs, gun charges, I don't know.  We got some audio of an eyewitness, Anthony.  An eyewitness that was on the scene.  Let's play that now.  All right.  Uh-huh.  She was shaking real bad news.  She said, Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, boo got shot.  Boo got shot.  I said, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We just got, my suicide called somebody, or a pin. 
[00:48:00]  She called my cousin, Punkin, just sailed up.  She called her, and Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  And Chi-Chi, she had left out, and she went and got in her car, and she bailed out.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again, when I heard the gunshot, and I seen some boy had run in the building over that way, he ran in that building.  And I seen that car that flew off.  And then I seen a long gun, a big old gun in the car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Boy, she makes it to a lot of shootings. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  The community reacts.  Let's continue here.  They shot him a lot of times.  For what reason?  They were trying to kill him.  They killed his friend.  So I guess they say, okay, I killed his friend.  Let me kill the rest of them so I don't have no witnesses.  This is absolutely crazy.  What they need to do is get rid of the task force.  That's what they need to do.  Emotional words from relatives of a man who is in intensive care, recovering from gunshot wounds.  Joseph Guzman was in the car police shot up Saturday morning, along with Trent Benefield, who's in stable condition, and groomed-to-be Sean Bell, who has died. 
[00:49:00]  If B-boys had guns, I can understand that.  If it was fine with them, fine.  All right.  They have a right to pull out their gun.  You know what?  This is wrong.  Well, they're emotional.  It is hard to justify 50 shots.  It is.  It's hard.  Like, you know, with Diallo, I understood.  Like, I read the transcripts of what they say happened.  And, you know, I'm very pro-cop, but it's hard to justify 50 shots. 
[00:49:30]  When you have that many cops, 50 shots can add up pretty quickly.  Yeah.  Speaking of which, let's talk to an ex-cop, Mike.  He says just that.  Mike in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What is the show?  Yeah.  You know, first off, at Jamaica, at 4 in the morning, you know who the cops are and who  the cops ain't.  That one's pretty simple.  Guy stood in front of the car, drew his gun, told him he was a cop.  The driver of that car ran the cop over.  That's your deadly weapon.  You don't need a gun.  Right.  That's your deadly weapon. 
[00:50:00]  One cop fires.  All you know is you have seven cops.  One guy fired.  The other cops are going to fire, thinking that there is a threat against one of them.  It takes about five seconds to unload your clip.  Five seconds.  Let me ask you a question.  If that's the case, if that's what happened, then they're justified.  If the guy really did try to run the cop over, that's understandable why you'd shoot him  on principle, because it's annoying.  But I've never heard of a case where there's a shooting where a cop just went, ah, I panicked. 
[00:50:30]  It's like there's always, always a reason.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  There's no panic involved.  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is I've never heard of a case.  I'm sure in life, all cops aren't perfect.  There's been unjustified shootings.  Most of them are justified, but I'm sure there's been some unjustified.  But I've never heard cops come out and go, yeah, that one we screwed up on.  We just misread something and shot him.  So how do you know, as a person who's not a cop, how do you know what account to believe  and what exactly is accurate and what's not accurate when you've never once heard them 
[00:51:00]  come out and go, yeah, we screwed up?  Well, you know the odds are they're human.  And let's say this, if you unload your clip and you still hear gunfire whizzing and you  don't know where it's coming from, are you going to sit there or are you going to load  your gun again?  You're going to reload.  I'd reload my gun and try as best you can without getting your head taken off, assess  the situation and return fire at who you think is shooting. 
[00:51:30]  But there were too many people and there was a lack of communication here.  Personally, that's not what I would do.  I would actually, I would try to get everybody together and I would try to talk and be rational.  That's the way I behave.  Poke your head up and go, hey, hey, hey, enough of this.  Who's shooting?  What a target your head would make.  Wow.  Even for people not involved in the melee.  See Jimmy's head come apart like that.  Just this white thing to be shot at.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island, Joe.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up with 50 shots and only three people getting shot? 
[00:52:00]  That's pretty pathetic for our police, don't you think?  Yeah, maybe back to the range, gentlemen.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Well, I think, you know, if it was a bunch of, you know, white cops that shot a bunch  of black kids, then there would have been a lot more public outcry than what you're  hearing now.  Well, I mean, you know, it's just, I guess it's a good thing that it wasn't, there was  only one white cop there, like, what was it, two other black cops?  No, I think it was two, two, and one who's Lebanese and Syrian. 
[00:52:30]  They pretty much cover everything except Asian.  I'm sorry, it's terrible, I was shooting, and Lebanese.  How did those gentlemen die?  My big, fat Lebanese fingers couldn't stop hitting the trigger.  I thought I was having, I thought it was a right click so you could download, and we're  making fun of Steve from Foundry Music, by the way, for any non-listeners.  For all the, yeah, the newer listeners out there, enjoy the Steve abuse, it's going to  happen often.  It never stops.  It runs the opianthony.com website, and he's a boob and an ass. 
[00:53:00]  All right, John, yeah, thanks.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey, John.  Perfect description.  Yeah.  It certainly is.  Hey there, Jan.  John, let's go.  John A., New Jersey.  Technical problems.  I forget it.  I heard it.  There you go.  Go, John.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Retired cop, 20 years, New York City.  You know what?  Again, we're paying, like the whole Michael Richards thing, if there were white kids in the  car, we'd never hear about this.  Because I am so sick of having to play this tune day in and day out. 
[00:53:30]  I mean, it's unfortunate.  No one deserves to be shot 50 times.  Right.  But it seems like being a white male in today's society, we are losers.  We cannot voice our opinion.  Yeah, we really have no recourse as far as anything goes.  There's no defense.  There's no â€“ you constantly feel like you're defending yourself just for being a white guy.  Now, black people are going to hear this, and this is just, again, devil's advocate, 
[00:54:00]  and go, how could you complain being white guys, you have no defense, when three black  guys were shot in the car and they were unarmed?  And I know it was by black and white cops.  I'm just saying, but how could â€“  But it was officers.  Yeah, it was police officers doing it.  It wasn't a gang of white youths that came up and shot into them.  It's very unfortunate, but it does happen.  It happens.  Every so often, you get these cases, and it happens. 
[00:54:30]  It's tragic.  All right, let's go to Jennifer.  What are you going to do?  She's irate.  Jennifer, what's up?  Hey, yeah.  I had another comment.  That's the other thing I wanted to comment on because it's been on my mind.  You sound all revved up already.  Oh, yeah.  I'm so sick and tired of this race bullshit because, you know what?  Listen.  Hold on.  No one's going to be able to hear you because they â€“ yeah, potty mouth.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I won't use that word again.  All right, go ahead.  Race.  Okay, I'm so sick and tired of the race stuff because, you know what?  The black man is just as much as racist because every time he calls me white, he's being racist 
[00:55:00]  because white is a race just as much as black is.  Oh, no.  White's a color.  No, then I should be called American.  Oh, shut up.  Ew.  I like the way she thinks â€“ no, I don't.  Oh, you're annoying me.  I'm not white.  I'm not black.  I'm American.  Are you?  Shut up.  I should be called American.  Should you?  American.  How about irritating and broad or whole?  Can we call you those things too?  Stop it with that childlike race attitude.  Why you?  Why you?  I'm American first, but we know that. 
[00:55:30]  By the way, I hate your name.  Reminds me I have to write a check.  Is it time for a check-in?  No, not January 1st.  All right.  Look, I despise political correctness.  It's vomit-inducing.  But white people, we're not really â€“ I can't say that we're victims.  I just â€“  I would say in a certain way.  We're not victims in the sense of other races that have to deal with certain things as being victims.  But we are victimized in that we cannot defend ourselves without coming off and being accused as being racist. 
[00:56:00]  You can't defend yourself as a white person.  You can try your best as an Italian, as an Irishman, as whatever, whatever other group you can fit in.  But just as a white male, you cannot defend yourself without having a Klan hat thrown on your head or a swastika drawn on your arm.  You're not allowed to.  You can't.  You're just not. 
[00:56:30]  I don't agree.  To a certain degree, I don't agree.  To a certain degree, I do agree, but to a certain point, I can't.  Like the Rodney King cops were acquitted.  Kiss me.  I'd love to.  It's not about my attraction to you.  Hey, we've got to bring this up.  Dave in Jersey has a good observation.  Dave.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Dave?  Dave.  Nothing.  Just like you were saying, quick observation.  Basically, how are you going to talk about police brutality and all this, and then right after you guys go to commercial, it's 2-1-2 recruit for the NYPD. 
[00:57:00]  Well, the NYPD needs recruits.  There's a couple of points they left off there, which I happen to point out to Anthony, I think, that on the next read we're going to mention.  Let me tell you how hard it is to read copy off of a sheet when Jimmy is holding up his own copy in front of my face.  That is 10 times more hysterical.  We've got to explain for the rest of the country, when we went local here in New York, we do live reads for the New York radio station.  And right after that intense discussion about what happened with the NYPD, we have a live read for the NYPD and how they're recruiting right now. 
[00:57:30]  Just timing.  It's in the log, so we were reading it.  It's for the NYPD recruiting.  And Jimmy is writing things down and holding them up right in front of my face.  Other things, qualifications, maybe adventures that you might get into.  Things you can do that Michael Richards would be proud of.  Oh, no kidding.  High me up, boys.  I'm ready.  All right.  Thanks for picking up on that because we forgot about that.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt in Jersey. 
[00:58:00]  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Matt.  Hey.  Hey.  The whole question, I have a friend that's an NYPD officer, and the question I don't get is, he told me what it says in the rule book.  I asked him this morning.  He says, when you shoot, you shoot three times and you reassess the situation.  You don't fucking empty your clip and then reload it when everyone else is shooting around you.  Like, don't you look around to see what's going on and see, like, who else is shooting?  Well, how many cops were there?  There was, like, seven cops, so three shots. 
[00:58:30]  He just 21 shots.  I mean, that's already a lot of shots.  Yeah.  No, they said there were four cops.  Man, who the hell is going to look around to see what's going on with the situation?  Yeah, and let me tell you something.  You fire three shots.  Your life is on the line at that point.  You fire three shots and shots are still winging around, the situation is assessed.  It's still dangerous.  Who would actually stop and look around and go, hmm, should I shoot some more?  You're just shooting.  Yeah, I mean, like, I understand.  That's a human reaction.  You're just going to keep shooting. 
[00:59:00]  You're not going to be the guy that pokes his head up.  Let's see.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Uh, hey, Bill, you all right?  Well, let me think.  I still hear some.  No, I think I need to continue shooting.  It's not gunfire.  I hear I.  No, I totally understand that, but it's just like, that's what the rule book says, but  like, for every different situation, there's always something different, so.  All right.  I don't get the whole, like, unloading of your clip.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, if you think someone's shooting at you out of a car, you should be able to shoot as 
[00:59:30]  many times as you have to.  I don't think you should shoot.  If you think guys are firing at you, and apparently one of the guys said that they fired through  the window, so the other cops who weren't with them thought they were being shot at from  the vehicle.  And look, in a situation like that, you're in a dumpy, awful neighborhood, you know,  you're going to empty your clip.  I'm just saying that they, you never hear, it's hard to tell because cops never come  out and go, look, we screwed up.  Yeah.  So it's really hard to tell when they're just giving you a story that sounds right and when  that's what actually happened.  And you can, you know, when you hear Reverend Al counting out 50 shots, you assume the  shooting took for, you know, an hour or whatever, a couple minutes. 
[01:00:00]  I mean, what's the reality?  It was five to 10 seconds, the whole thing?  Seconds, man.  It just, it's, this was one of those situations.  Didn't you say less than 10 seconds?  Yeah.  It's all about, it's all about split decision making, like basically how you assess it right  at that moment.  And the circumstances that happened, everything that led up to this was something being misinterpreted,  something like, things just happened.  There was a chain of events that happened that caused this. 
[01:00:30]  Um, it, I, I cannot see this as being this intentional conspiracy, uh, you know, thing  that, that some people are trying to make it.  It's a tragic, uh, case of friendly fire where innocent people were caught in the middle  or it was a case of some guy, some guy trying to run over a cop with his car for some apparent  reason, whether he thought he was in danger of his life will come into play.  If he's in this, like you said, crappy neighborhood, they're plainclothes cops. 
[01:01:00]  He gets drawn on.  He thinks maybe it's a gangbanger.  He thinks maybe it's someone trying to rob him.  Uh, he's going to step on the gas and try to run the guy over.  Maybe that's what he thought.  And that would justify him in trying to run the cop over.  But you know, if the cop identified himself, pulled out a shield, there's another thing.  This all has to be hashed out in front of, uh, uh, an investigation and a grand jury.  And believe me, it'll be looked at really closely. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  My question is this.  None of the guys in the car had drugs.  I mean, to my knowledge, none of them had drugs.  None of them had guns.  Yeah.  Why, when you're on your way to your own wedding or when you're on your way from a bachelor  party, I'm not saying that you haven't done scumbag things.  Why do you try to kill a cop with your car when you have nothing?  You have no weapons.  You have no drugs.  Yeah.  I'm not saying you're not angry at the cops or you like the cops, but just a question.  If you know it's a cop, why do you try to commit a murder on a cop on the way to get  married?  Exactly.  Maybe he didn't know it was a cop. 
[01:02:00]  Like I said, maybe he thought he was, his life was in danger.  And then he was justified in stepping on the gas and trying to run the guy over.  This is all the stuff that's got to be looked at.  And it's way too early.  And for the mayor to jump on and say, yeah, he's done his investigation in what?  Less than a couple, what?  Two, three days tops.  For anybody to jump in, the mayor, all these activists that are outraged and this, that  or the other thing have to sit back and wait and, and wait for the investigation. 
[01:02:30]  Off of the instant feedback, you got to give me a little bit of a break.  I said, 50 shots, what?  What?  That takes an hour.  But I quickly, you know, corrected myself.  Someone writes, hey, Ope, is this 1870?  Yeah.  If it was 1870, then you could assess the situation in between shots.  If it was 1870, you wouldn't have to.  Oh my God.  To use the Kramer method.  Yes.  Fork not included.  Yes.  You'd be, you'd be yelled at for wasting bullets.  Why did you miss?  All right. 
[01:03:00]  Well, well, this is ongoing, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This will go on and on and on.  So.  We got to get to a duty talk.  And, you know, like you said, when is the next time the cops came out and admitted that  they screwed up?  When's the last time black leaders came out and admitted that the white cops or whatever  would justify it?  I mean, it's the same thing on both sides.  They never come out and say, yeah, these guys were animal.  However you defend the animals that attacked Bernhardt gets.  I mean, when civil and community activists rush to the defense of those animals, you can't  take anything they say seriously. 
[01:03:30]  It's, yeah, because they don't cover both sides.  All right.  Yeah.  There is one more we want to get to.  Tina in Long Beach.  Tina.  Tina, turn down your radio.  Turn down the radio.  Turn down the radio.  Hi, Tina.  Heavy up.  Heavy up.  Turn down that radio.  Three.  Good morning.  Hi, Tina.  Good morning.  Yes.  I just wanted to state that when is the last time that there was a Caucasian person that  got shot mistakenly by the New York State police? 
[01:04:00]  When did they get shot?  I'm not sure.  And also, I wanted to say that you guys are like enticing racism.  How?  With your remarks that you make, white power.  It was, oh my God, that was such a joke.  Tina, Tina, Tina.  It was a joke, but it's not funny.  I agree, Tina.  No, hold on.  I agree.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I agree with Tina because it doesn't cite.  That's not funny.  I agree.  It incites hate.  Oh, it's funny.  Tina, Tina, let me.  You guys really should take other people's feelings into consideration. 
[01:04:30]  Let me explain, Tina.  Did you see, Tina, Tina, Tina, did you, I agree.  Did you see that the caller that was on when we did that was baiting us and the only way  to satisfy what he was, what he wanted out of us was to go to the extreme other end  and say something so ridiculous like white power as to make that point?  See, but that takes.  Do you understand that that's why we said that?  That's not funny, right, Tina?  See, that takes intelligence to figure out, which you don't have, obviously. 
[01:05:00]  All right, go ahead.  We go through a lot of racism on jobs, on anywhere we go.  I don't doubt it.  In the street, even.  In the street, in the mall.  I understand.  In Chess King.  And then the talkers are taking it lightly.  We're African Americans.  We're trying to make it.  Give us reparation, then.  What do you want reparations for?  Wait, Tina, what?  Lavery.  What?  All the money that you kept from us.  But what did I do?  But Tina.  I love her.  Tina, what did I do? 
[01:05:30]  Are you insane, Tina?  You know how you can laugh, but everything you got, you didn't earn.  You took it from people.  But I earned that.  I earned that job.  Tina, reparations would have been.  Because you can do that.  But if you give us our reparation back, all the sweat and tears.  Reparations.  Reparations.  Tina, I didn't.  Go screw it.  Nothing to do with slavery.  We can sit down and laugh together.  I agree.  Good point, Tina.  I didn't enslave anybody, Tina.  You shouldn't do that.  Tina, could you listen for a second? 
[01:06:00]  I have a passion for the African Americans.  This is why black guys date white women.  It's right here is why black guys date white women.  You can't get a word in.  You want to put us back.  You have a black code.  You understand?  A what?  We need to stop you.  I like her.  Let me hear her.  Yeah, let's just listen.  Let me listen.  You need to stop advocating for racism because it's real.  You understand?  You're laughing and joking, but it's not funny.  But Tina.  It's not funny to you.  It's funny to others, including some of our fine black listeners out there, Tina. 
[01:06:30]  But Tina.  You really do talk a lot.  Can I get a word?  Will you shut up and let's have a little bit of a discussion?  Can I get a word in, Tina, please?  That's disrespectful.  Yes.  You're a babbling woman.  Shut up.  Tina, can I get a word in edgewise?  Yes, you can.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Tina.  The reparations thing is a little silly because, and let me finish, nobody that is here was  there during that time. 
[01:07:00]  So what do we, doesn't, but wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Tina, I can't steal this  line.  Matt from Jersey, where's Ike Turner when you need him?  Your 10 children, trust funds, everybody's benefiting from it from us.  Who the hell has a trust fund?  Tina, from you, don't you believe that the United States was built on everyone's back?  No.  Just black people.  We were forced to come here.  Just black people's back.  We were forced to come here.  We were forced to work.  Then go home. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, but.  We were in shackles.  God.  Yeah, no, no.  We know the story.  Kramer said, as Kramer said.  Kramer.  That's what happened.  I missed that episode.  Hello, somebody.  So this is something that's an ongoing thing.  And then it's evasive racism that's going on.  But Tina, don't you think that, then don't you think, don't you think every.  It was no reason for them to shoot that gentleman.  That many.  Tina, why do you talk so much?  Tina, will you shut up?  You're a babbling woman. 
[01:08:00]  That's why I'm talking so much.  Why are you babbling?  We're in edgewise.  You're babbling.  We're not able to like talk back.  I want to meet you guys.  I want to meet you guys.  And I want to give you guys a hug.  Because it seems like you have been discriminated against by African-Americans.  That's right.  I want to give you some love.  They talk too much.  I want to give you some love.  Oh, my God.  So you can understand where we're coming from.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I know.  That's who you call on.  Call him.  You talk too much.  Sweetie, you talk too much.  Yeah, you got it.  You talk too much, too.  That's why I had to call.  Good comeback.  So they had to call and talk to you. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, but you don't let anybody have a conversation with you.  See, this is babble.  This is not a black-white thing.  This is a woman thing.  There's no forgetting you, Tina.  I know.  Thank you.  And I'm going to give you a shout-out, too.  I'll be calling back again.  Thank you, Tina.  Thank you.  Tina.  Yes?  What do you think when you hear the word uppity?  Be nice.  Be nice.  Be nice.  Be nice.  You're a bit uppity, though.  Respect.  Respect.  You're a bit uppity.  Respect.  It's hard to have respect when you can't get a word in edgewise.  You are a chatty Cathy. 
[01:09:00]  You are a chatty, chatty Tina.  Who's married to you there, Tina?  You got a husband?  Yes, I do.  And what does he do for a living?  He works hard.  All right.  What does he do?  Yeah, of course he's working hard.  He's got four jobs, so he doesn't have to come home.  Oh, you're so funny.  So disrespectful, and that's funny.  I don't like the disrespect.  That was funny.  You got to admit.  No, it's not.  It's disrespectful.  It's not.  You're not funny.  You're very arid.  Tina, you sound a little intense is what I'm getting at.  It has nothing to do with color. 
[01:09:30]  And if I was a man and I was coming home to this house where you lived, I would be a  little on edge.  A little on edge.  He believes the same thing I do.  Stop being racist.  I just want to have a conversation with you.  It's impossible.  Tina, here's the point.  It's impossible.  Tina, the point.  Tina.  Tina, shut up.  You try.  I'm trying to agree with you.  I'm trying to agree with you.  The point I'm making is that black broads babble a lot, and it's broads like you are why I  don't bang blacks because of babbling black broads like you. 
[01:10:00]  If you didn't babble so much, I'd throw you one.  Oh, we are staying.  Have you ever lost a loved one?  What's that?  Have you ever lost a loved one?  No.  Every relative I've ever had is still alive.  My great-great-great-grandmother is 430 years old.  They're all alive.  And it's getting tougher to get them that Christmas gift.  Exactly.  What do you buy someone who should have been dead 400 years ago?  I know.  They have everything. 
[01:10:30]  I'm not going to put all this on the radio.  Tina.  It is on the radio.  You are on the radio.  It's live.  You're live on the radio.  We're live.  Are you kidding me?  We wish you would call every day.  We want to give the family a shout-out and let them know that we've been making joy for  a night, but joy cometh in the morning.  Just keep your head up.  Joy cometh in the morning?  Joy cometh in the morning.  When you finally wipe off your back and get out, that's when joy cometh.  You guys are foolish and have no compassion.  Yep.  What?  You have to stop to condemn your radio station.  What's a radio station? 
[01:11:00]  Your radio station.  But, Tina, you never allowed us to even respond to you.  You're not being very nice.  You never allowed us to respond, which is the ultimate disrespect.  You've disrespected us.  Yeah.  You've disrespected us without allowing us to respond to anything you've said.  You're so disrespectful.  I tried to tell you that I don't bang black broads because you babble too much, and the  reason I don't bang the darkies is because you don't stop talking.  You're saying something for the family, because that could have been my son. 
[01:11:30]  That could have been my husband that got mistaken.  No, he couldn't have, but he would have shot himself to get away from the sound of your  voice.  My God.  You don't know who they were.  You don't reload up.  The law needs to be changed.  No, it doesn't.  You're not able to shoot 5,500 whatever times.  5,500?  5,500.  Wow.  That would be silly.  Wow.  Whatever is right.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  All right, Tina.  I like you.  You got spunked.  Tina, how long have you been married?  How long have you been married?  Oh, you're not. 
[01:12:00]  No, we're not.  And why should we be?  And what is that?  You don't want nobody that's ignorant.  You're acting very ignorant.  Are you insane?  I'm in a great relationship.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kramer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kramer.  Yeah.  F***.  Opi.  That's why you talk so much because you can't handle your business in a room.  No, we talk a lot because that's our job.  Tina, are you insane?  Do you know what I can do in a bedroom?  Do you know what I can get done in a bedroom? 
[01:12:30]  She's black.  Calm down, Ophie.  She's seen things you never, ever could imagine.  Are you insane?  Are you trying to say I'm not good in bed?  You're dysfunctional in a bedroom, and that's...  How the F do you know?  That's why you have...  I get the job done, Tina.  Tina's got a little jungle fever.  Yeah.  I think she wants a white guy.  The problem with Tina is she's not getting...  Your husband's not taking care of business, and that's why you talk so much.  If your husband knew what he was doing in bed, you would shut your mouth.  Because my husband's on the same page.  Reparations.  Of course he's on the same page. 
[01:13:00]  Of course he's on the same page.  He's scared to disagree with you.  I want reparations.  Yeah.  I want reparations for this phone call.  I want the 20 minutes of my life that you stole.

[01:16:00]  but you come down here  and I will prove I'm not a little man  all right  you better be  so long  you better be packing  she's probably  that's all she's got  that she's gonna  say that  I'm a little man  you're a little man  Jimmy's a little man  cause we're white  you know cause white guys  I guess don't have big ones  like black guys  that's what she's saying  Tina  if you're still listening  come down anytime you want  and I'll prove I'm not a little man  Tina was very racist  that's right  I got a giant hog  what a babbling hole  it's like just shut up  she was very racist 
[01:16:30]  her husband  how do you not choke your wife to death  in front of her husband  I bet she shuts the hell up  cause he'd probably smack her in the face  no he doesn't  he's probably emasculated  and agrees with her reparations nonsense  while he performs in a mediocre fashion in bed  alright  he makes good money  wow  she is probably still babbling  I'm sure she is  oh she certainly is  and the phones are still lit  and we gotta get in  it's very heated  yeah there's a lot of race on the show today  because uh  you know 
[01:17:00]  now they're  they're calling for the ban of the n-word  yeah  this is very very dangerous  isn't it already banned  look  we can't say it  yeah  unfortunately it is  it's banned  you watch the news  they don't say it  they bleep it out of everything  they cut it out  they say the n-word  it's already banned  so  so  shut up you  well the laugh factory in LA  has banned the n-word  the laugh factory  a comedy club  uh  the  what is supposed to be like  the last bastion of free speech  we'll talk about it 
[01:17:30]  when we come back  because Jimmy's got some thoughts on that  which I wasn't thinking  and I think Jimmy's uh  Jimmy's onto something  also  what Jesse Jackson wants uh  entertainment in general  to  to get rid of the n-word  right  alright  we're gonna get into some stuff  it's the Opie and Anthony show  it's the 2006 eggnog challenge  coming to the Opie and Anthony show  Friday December 1st 
[01:18:00]  if you have a hankering  for rich  creamy  thick  holiday eggnog goodness  and a lot of it  then you need to step up  and take the eggnog challenge  for details on how to participate  visit opieandanthony.com  or foundrymusic.com  it's the 2006 eggnog challenge  Friday December 1st  it's the Opie and Anthony show  hey thanks for checking us out  this morning  it's the Opie and Anthony show  we got Jamal from Jersey  what's up Jamal 
[01:18:30]  hey  oh and hey Jim what up  this girl Tina  is a poor representation  of black people  wow she wouldn't stop  she's like  reparations  you know honey  you wasn't alive  in 1762  yeah I don't get  the reparations thing  you do  I just don't understand  the reparations thing  I understand  there was  you know  a lot of hardship  for black people  brought over 
[01:19:00]  as slaves  back then  I don't think  anyone's denying that  well maybe a couple  of people down south  yeah  but  I think the majority  of the people  will agree with that  but the idea  that some type  of payment  be made  to long  dead  ancestors  through their  families now  by white people  that probably  most of the families  weren't even here  like where's  where's that money 
[01:19:30]  coming from  taxpayers  it'd be coming  from like three  families in Alabama  don't black people  pay taxes  like wouldn't that  be kind of  some of that money  going back  like how would  they make sure  the reparations  are only coming  from the people  that it's supposed  to come from  how much money  is everybody  supposed to get  what if you're  not African  what if your  ancestors were  never brought over  as slaves  what if  you're Caribbean  they might say  that the black  with the situation  for black people  that started back  then they may say  affected all blacks 
[01:20:00]  that came over here  they may say  it snowballed  so like all the  things that benefit  white people now  and went against  black people  kind of started  back then  so even though  we our families  are from Ireland  or whatever  we are still  benefiting from  what happened  look  I mean that's  their argument  look I could do  without peanut oil  I heard that's  a myth too  I can do  without the peanut  I heard George  Washington Carver  was actually  a peanut hack  and didn't invent  a lot of peanut  treats  I heard peanut butter  yeah  was actually invented 
[01:20:30]  before George  Washington Carver  this is something  I read called  the debunking  the legend  of black inventions  which was probably  some white revisionist  writing it  you know  it was very funny  to read all the  things that black  people invented  that he said  they didn't  there's fun people  on both sides  that like  the revisionist  history  hey while we have  Jamal on the  the phone here  Jamal  I needed  I needed help  from a black guy  better get a black  guy on the phone  good luck  I just  I put out a  challenge to Tina  now I'm getting  a little nervous  during the break  I went into  the old bathroom 
[01:21:00]  to check out  some stuff  and I'm now  a little nervous  you should be  so I want to know  what the average is  you don't throw  that challenge  out there  I'm trying to  fluff up in the  bathroom  he walks out  he looks like  Bob Kelly's  Shih Tzu  when he picks it up  just pink  wet  and of no value  to anybody  that's great  if your lip  gloss is wearing off  you put yourself  up against  a militant  black guy  who wants  reparations  right  I put  the challenge  out there  to Tina  and now I'm  getting a little 
[01:21:30]  good luck  you could use  a metric  tape measure  she was  calling us  little men  or me  I guess  it turned out  to be  she was  calling me  a little man  and I said  alright  well come down  I'll show you  what I got  packing  now I'm  getting a little  nervous  so maybe  before the end  of the show  some of the  black dudes  could call up  and give me  the average  in the community  I want to see  if I have a chance  give us the area  just take your width  and multiply it  by length  we'd like the area  the total area  let's go to 
[01:22:00]  Kina  from Queens  Kina  hi  good morning  how are you guys  hi Kina  well I'm hoping  to be the intelligent  black woman  to count against  oh thank god  Tina was a little  much to deal with  yeah she was  Jamal said she was  a bad representation  of black people  a bad reparation  I don't know  what I was about to say  so what do you got  to say today  basically what I was  going to say  is that  it is a difficult  situation to deal with  the fact that  things like this  are such a hot button  helps us to appreciate 
[01:22:30]  racism  unfortunately  is still alive  but one thing  for me that's hard  I'm a middle class  black person  good for you  thank you  never lived in the  projects  and most of my  friends are the same  and yet  I did  not most of my  friends  some of my  black male  friends  have been  stopped by the  cops  seemingly just  because  yeah  because when  the cops  you know  they say to the 
[01:23:00]  cop  you know  what did I do  don't ask me  any questions  yeah  unfortunately  a lot of  innocent black  guys get pulled  over because  cops especially  in the New York  area  a majority  of that type  of crime  where you know  it's in a car  something's going  on are committed  by black guys  so they are  profiling  not supposed to  they get stopped  in the middle  of the day  in Richmond Hill  Queens  yeah 
[01:23:30]  where black  people live  and it's  middle of the  day on Liberty  Avenue  it seems  kind of like  what's going  on and when  the cop  let you go  and he  doesn't even  issue a warning  or tell you  what you're  for  just checking  on shenanigans  just checking  to make sure  you're not up to  any shenanigans  you can make  your life a lot  easier by just  driving around  in a crappier  car  is that it  maybe your  car is too  nice and he  assumes it's  stolen miss  I'm sorry 
[01:24:00]  let's just be  honest here  you drive a  crappier car  you would  have no  problems  there are  there are  plenty of  injustices going  on as far  as profiling  goes and  innocent black  people  responsible  hardworking  taxpaying black  people are being  pulled over  which is a  form of  harassment  on the part  of the police  unfortunately  where is that  coming from  is it a  deep-seated  racism  that has  existed for 
[01:24:30]  hundreds of  years  or is it  something  a response  to what  these people  have to deal  with on a  daily basis  with black  people  well I put it  like this  this weekend  I was watching  the documentary  eyes on the  prize  have you ever  heard of that  yeah  it talks about  the civil rights  struggle of the  60s  oh I thought  it was black  guys getting  white chicks  sorry  damn it  not that one  another document  Y-E-Z  yeah  no but 
[01:25:00]  basically  what it was  just talking  about black  people really  in their  struggle to  vote  to you know  go to equal  schools  have equal  housing in the  sense of  being able to  live where they  wanted to live  because in the  south a lot of  black people  and white  people were  on the same  claim  financially  but it  was this  separate  society  and blacks 
[01:25:30]  had to do  things separately  so they were  fighting for the  right to be  equal because  as American  citizens  and no  matter what  anybody says  you know  people say  black people  if they don't  like it  they should  go home  well  that's  that's  ridiculous  but don't  you think  don't you  think we've  we've passed  that point  though  because a  lot of  times when  we get  into arguments  about race  when blacks  and whites  get into  arguments  about race  it always  has to go  back in time  we always  got to jump  in a time  machine  why can't 
[01:26:00]  we look at  what's going  on right  now  a lot of  other people  do  I mean  but let's  just deal  with what's  happening  right now  but let me  finish  a lot of  times when you  talk to  Jewish people  you take it  back to the  holocaust  yeah I know  that's  which never  happened  that they  take it  back to the  holocaust  but  I'm sorry  what did you  say  Jimmy said  that never  happened  that fantasy  that fairy tale  Jesus Christ  you know but  it's like  other people  do take it  back  but it seems  a lot of  times when we  say well 
[01:26:30]  let's take it  back  it's like why  are you talking  about the past  the past is  over  you know why  because I think  the Jewish  people and  Asians  everyone's got  their crosses  to bear as far  as their history  goes with  enslavement  and just  atrocities  committed against  them  but they seem  to have  assimilated  to this  society  better than  the black  people have  Jews  of course  they've  assimilated  to the  society  but they  remember  their hardships 
[01:27:00]  but Jews  and Irish  were also  considered  second class  citizens  Italians too  I mean  not to the  extent  that  you know  we were  used  as  slave  labor  like  blacks  were  but  again  we gotta  jump out  of this  friggin  time  machine  every time  this  conversation  comes up  and deal  with the  now  there are  rights  now  and  special  scholarships 
[01:27:30]  and programs  that are  just dedicated  to black  people  there are  plenty of  advantages  out there  right now  that aren't  being used  by the  majority  of black  people  why is  that  how come  there has  to be  this easy  fix  the reparations  the because  you did  this to us  this many  years ago  you owe  us this  why can't  we just  work for a  living  pay our  friggin taxes  and in  time I  bet not  as many  people are 
[01:28:00]  going to be  getting pulled  over  well I  would hope  so  yeah  wouldn't  be nice  and see  the thing  about it  is  oh boy  Kina you  gotta wrap  up  we're  going way  too fast  today  yeah I'll  come over  to your  house we'll  chat  yeah we'll  have some  tea or  something  but what  do you  want to  say  can I  just say  one thing  about reparations  I don't  believe that  each individual  black person  should get  a check  from the  government  but the  government  is very  good at  doling out  money to  different  people  German  Jews 
[01:28:30]  who the  US  government  did nothing  to have  gotten  monies  from the  government  to account  for what  the German  government  do  Japanese  Americans  who were  put in  German  camps  were  given  monies  for the  atrocities  that are  committed  against them  and I  don't have  a problem  with that  but I  have a  problem  that when  I feel  that if  you say  American  government  there's  no  you know  why  there's  really no  accountability  again as  to who  needs the  money  who gets 
[01:29:00]  the money  how the  money is  distributed  but there  was for  Japanese  that were  in  internment  camps  there's  a record  of that  so that's  why  they were  why did  you pluralize  money  money  people always  say monies  when they're  trying to  sound official  said monies  were given  to  said  money  no one  says  monies  Kina  we'll continue  at a later  date  have a good  day  guys  thank you  Kina  let's say  hi to Mike  in Jersey  what's up  Mike  Mike  Mike's

[01:40:00]  from 12  to 14  it's an unlucky  number  and then of course  when it's something  where it's good news  I don't want to  read this  let someone else  read it  oh it's good  good okay  but also  the first words  I mean  you know  you know the deal  because you do  the same thing  by the time  Kenny sees me  I've only been awake  maybe maybe  15 to 17 minutes  and also  what's wrong  with your neck  and also  now I think  something might  be wrong  in my neck  I'm going to  find out  when I  officially wake up  rats been 
[01:40:30]  chewing on  and Kenny's  the best  at telling you  to shut up  politely  like we all  complain about  the same thing  he has to hear  our nonsense  and he's just  good at listening  he's a good  listener  but I'll say  something like  man I can't  believe I ate  like such a pig  it's okay  treat yourself  treat yourself  you deserve it  you worked hard  gets all excited  if you start  getting a little  roll  he secretly  is happy  just stay away  from the trans fats  because they'll  kill you  I knew a guy  I got a whole  list of things  that'll kill you  if you want to 
[01:41:00]  hear it  and by those  he means fats  that are  male fats  dressed in  female fats  clothing  not transgendered  fats  what you go  and pick up  at night  so that was  my ride today  come here chubby  I'm trying to  think if there  was anything else  every morning  it's some  just bad thing  weather's going  to be bad  for our flight  to West Palm Beach  and there's  something wrong  with my neck  that I was  unaware of  you do understand  planes fly above  the clouds  I know  but if there's  going to be  delays 
[01:41:30]  then you know  you're going  to be miserable  sitting there  see  Kenny's the only  person on a plane  it actually rains  on him in the  plane  he's the only one  it's weather  I fully expected  it  stewardess  umbrella  please  we could have  flown out on the  10 a.m.  if someone knew  how to do  ticketing  oh yeah  that one  yeah we've heard  that one  I'm sitting in  the last row  of the plane  and you purposely  it's the worst one  because he purposely  does that  he's the martyr  he is the martyr 
[01:42:00]  the seat doesn't  go all the way  back  oh no it would  they just wondered  why is there a hole  in the wall  I put my head back  I had to sleep  like Herman Munster  flying  Kenny told me  one time  he was flying  in first  for working with  Dice  and he puts his  chair all the way  back  and there was  like the seat  went all the way  back  and the guy  behind him  was annoyed  so the guy  kept opening  his newspaper  and brushing  the back  of Kenny's  hair  oh it could  start a fire  and what did  you say  you said  something menacing  to him  on the plane  I forget  but that was  like a whole  big deal 
[01:42:30]  the stewardess  yelled at me  to put my seat  up  and it was  coming back  get out of here  from the weekend  you know  and I'm like  I'm not putting  my seat up  it goes back  just as far  you know  tell him to put  him to put his  back  because I purposely  I sit in bulkhead  so nobody can  put their seat  back  you are a bulkhead  and the stewardess  yelled at me  to put my seat up  and then the guy  next to me  who was like  minding his own  business  I made him  put his seat  because she said  my seat was broken  it was going  too far back  and the guy 
[01:43:00]  next to me  who wanted  no part of the  argument  I made him  put his seat  back  to show that  it went back  the same length  and then the guy  was so annoyed  he just kept  kicking my chair  and like  you know  hit me with  the newspaper  what an ass  stewardess was  taking his side  so what finally  happened  I just went  the plane  went down  all perished  but me  didn't you  tell the guy  to stop  touching you  I probably  did  alright  way to humiliate me  alright  bring up a fun  story  something menacing  something menacing 
[01:43:30]  no no  this is gentle  Kenny  I don't remember  I have no  common sense  filter in my brain  alright Kenny  I'm out the window  like Goldfinger  hey let's say hi  to Kevin Smith  good friend of the show  Kevin what's up buddy  good morning sirs  how is everybody  hi Kevin  oh boy  Kevin's on LA time  we can tell you're  calling from LA  Kevin has his LA voice  this is the same  you would imagine  me being in LA  and on LA time  I could just do  an LA bump  and I'd be like  oh boy  yeah  now you got that  same voice I used  to have when I used  to call my boss 
[01:44:00]  and tell him I wasn't  coming in today  because I was sick  five minutes before  I was supposed to be  there  ironically this is also  my sexy voice  my wife says  yeah your bedroom voice  my bedroom voice  very much my bedroom voice  but my wife  obviously no taste  chubby chaser  so  did you get up  or are you laying  in bed nude  no I actually  had to leave the room  and come upstairs  onto the couch  not to wake  everybody up  but when we're done  I might be nude sir  are you in your  underpants 
[01:44:30]  I'm in my  sleeping shorts  just about as close  to underpants  as I get  I'm not a nudist  man  I always gotta be close  what was that thing  from the rest of development  I'm a never nude  always  never nude  not even in bed  huh  oh heavens no  no  sometimes you gotta  just kinda  take it off  I love being naked  in bed  I swear to you  this is the only way  I'll sleep  I don't care who  I'm sharing a bed with  bunk beds with Kenny  if I had a body  like Norton's  I'd be naked all the time  yeah  it's delicious  from the waist down  from the waist up  I need a little work  from the waist down  lick your lips 
[01:45:00]  here it comes  that's odd  is that like a  what is it about  being nude in bed  self-hantored  for him  no for you  like why  why don't you want to be  oh  you know  body shame  is it body shame  I've been with this woman  for 8 years  and I'm still like  if she sees me  with my shirt off  she might be like  oh I'm out of here  you're a shirt  and shorts  to bed guy  oh totally  and air conditioner  on all the time  year round  it's like  it's like  going to  going to bed  and you know  the Ingalls house  on Little House 
[01:45:30]  yeah you're going  to the Soddy  everything but a  but a nightcap  the little nightcap  what do you do  I went away with my girlfriend  and we took a bath  recently like a jacuzzi  and it's  it's just  because I'm self-conscious  about my man breasts  and all  don't you  don't you hate  when your wife  or someone wants  to take a bath  and you have to ease in  and suck your own gut in  in front of somebody  that you're actually  sleeping with  we're way past that  so she's given up  on asking to take baths  and I'm like  that's no romantic  it's just gay  and it's code for like  don't look at me 
[01:46:00]  don't see me  in the light of day  try to keep yourself  covered  that's why I look out dude  because she's a  you know  she's a total top  and I'm a bottom  and that's good  that's where I get  the most afraid man  because if I'm a top  then I'm over  and guts swinging  and looking disgusting  oh man  you gotta do like  the push up  so you don't put  all your weight on her  absolutely  yes  oh boy  if I lose balance  she's dead  but I never have to  worry about that  because she's a total top  that's nice  Kevin now that you're 
[01:46:30]  kind of waking up  what do you think  of Jesse Jackson  he's calling  for everyone  to ban the n-word  especially in entertainment  the n-word  he's talking about  movies and music  and TV  I mean  I guess he has to  start within the community  right  because that's where  is most prevalently  yeah  apparently he said  the entertainment industry  which people are assuming  is rap artists  but he also mentioned  movies  and television  now I haven't really  seen much on TV  but the news 
[01:47:00]  doesn't even show it  or use it  or show it in transcripts  that are underneath video  they blocked it out  when Michael Richards'  video was being played  but movies now  and that's  you're in a line of work  there Kevin  and I've seen  a couple of movies  where perhaps  that word was used  yes  yeah  and it is  I'm sorry  it's always funny  to hear in a movie  I don't know why  it's all context  yeah  it's all context 
[01:47:30]  no not in Ruth  you idiot  Jimmy  but you know  we were bringing up  movies where  you know  God  where would  taking that word out  really just destroy  a movie  and Pulp Fiction  is one I can think of  well Pulp Fiction  more than Pulp Fiction  was Jackie Brown  yeah Jackie Brown  Jackie Brown  was where he used it  you know  he used it to the point  that Spike Lee  chided him for using it  yeah  yeah  yeah I remember that 
[01:48:00]  Quentin Tarantino  got like  bitched at  for using  the N word  we're adults  saying the N word  by the way  by the way  we don't say the N word  over at XM  no  CBS for some reason  they have banned  that word  from radio shows  it's a CBS policy  not an FCC policy  but if a black guy  comes in and uses it  it's not a derogatory way  as long as he does it  only like twice  it all has to do  with whether you're using  the ER ending  or the A ending  no they didn't 
[01:48:30]  they don't even want  the A ending  nah  they don't even want  like  how does a rapper  come in and talk  about his friends  yeah  well a rapper's able to  as long as he's not  K-Fed  is this all stemming  off of the KK Kramer  incident  no this is before that  this is from the  FCC has  radio companies  petrified  and they're afraid  that you know  if a word is used  and a letter is written  that every sponsor  will just pull out  so they're very  petrified 
[01:49:00]  or far  I mean  the thing is  I have mixed feelings  about it  because I'm like  now  what happened like  in the midst  of the civil right movement  wouldn't that be a time  where you're like  let's get rid of that word  but now  like 40 years later  yeah I know  it makes no sense  whatsoever  a lot of power  has been taken away  as far as that word goes  over the years  and now it's like  now that what they're  trying to do  is bring the power  back into the word  by doing this  totally  I mean you're talking  about a word  that has been  kind of sapped 
[01:49:30]  of most of its energy  because it's been  appropriated by  in the same way  that the gay community  uses queer  to call queer  it's  I just don't understand  why you would  campaign now  there are certain words  in the gay community  like you know  that you can't use  like you know  they dump us  if we say  if we finish fag  if we go beyond that  describing gay people  they dump out of it  not on XM  by the way  not on XM  no only on CBS  of course  because it might  affect sponsorship  yeah like I could say  like hey  someone goes  you know 
[01:50:00]  hey Kevin  you want to go out  tonight  and you go  nah I'm tired  and then you go  don't be a faggot  come on out  that's fine  but you can't use it  in a derogatory way  to a gay gentleman  or else it will be  dumped out of  but isn't that  isn't that  what isn't that  six of one  half dozen the other  exactly  it is the rules  that's very strange  like I would imagine  the prior usage  the you want to go out  tonight  no I don't want to go out  tonight  oh don't be a faggot  is more incendiary  because it's really 
[01:50:30]  it's taking the term  and turning it into  an even deeper negative  yeah  yeah it's adding  another negative to it  I mean but I don't want  to give my ideas  so keep using  ah don't be a faggot  come on  are we really going to miss  are we getting  my only problem with this  is like if they drop  the n-word  not that it's going to be  a restable offense  but does it really serve  any good purpose  in entertainment  I mean I'm playing  devil's advocate  away but a part of me  is like eh  let him take it away  it's like  all the people  you want to use it  are rappers  and occasionally  in movies  it should be used  but do you really need it  I think it does  in movies 
[01:51:00]  and also well  you know what  the Chappelle show  is over  so we don't need  the word anymore  you probably used it  the best  in the last five years  yeah  the most entertaining  so much so  that you were like  man I think I could  get away with using  that word  but not really  yeah yeah  oh we're so close  he turned it into  an art form  and really just  kind of colloquialized it  and really drained  a lot of its  negative energy  but since that show  is not on anymore  I guess they can take it  it's dangerous  when you start 
[01:51:30]  banning words too  man  because you get  the n-word  banned  and then  then what  you know  then we got to  ban spick  we got to  we got to go  right down the line  eventually right  and Dago  Dago  WAP  yeah  but how often  like in all truth  how often do you use  racial expletives  in your day to day  every moment  I'm in the car  driving in New York City  every single day  I am  I'm more of a  whore guy  I use whore quite a bit 
[01:52:00]  whore  whore and bitch  I use the C word  rarely if ever  is it used in reference  to women  it's just  I just like those words  we talked to Sean Hannity  yesterday on the XM show  and he  we had a whole discussion  about this as well  and he said that  it never comes to mind  those words  when he's in a really  really  you know  tough situation  or he's been pushed  to the limit  and the furthest  he'll go is  he'll say jerk  yeah  like jerk  and we're like  come on Sean 
[01:52:30]  could you just be honest  are you kidding me  you gotta be honest  I understand that  would probably wreck  your entire career  but no one's buying that  that's the furthest you go  when you're being  pushed out there  because we were saying  it's always the atomic bomb  it's that last weapon  that you can use  that is the ultimate  so if you're driving  down the road  and you get cut off  and almost driven  into a guard rail  and then whatever  the ethnic background  of the driver is  you might not yell it  out the window  but you're at least  gonna think it  it's gonna creep  into your head 
[01:53:00]  if it's a black guy  I'm sorry  that n-word pops in  if it's an Asian guy  you'll say  the ch word  right  I'm gonna do that  to every thing now  the ch  the ch word  or the guh  or the guh word  yes the g word  remember when  sarah silverman  got in trouble  for using the ch word  on letterman  yes  in the midst of it  like a joke  like not even using it  in a  like just tossing it off 
[01:53:30]  in terms of  that was on her mind  at the time  it was all set  payoff for  a very long setup  about going to court  yeah  well  and that's what  opa was saying before  if the n-word  is banned  in movies  guaranteed  it is followed  by every other  ethnic slur  or perceived  ethnic slur  and then where  do we go  after we ban  all the slur  every group  then you ban  black people  from movies  it's the only way  we can go  then I'm prepared 
[01:54:00]  because  then all that time  spending  sleeping in a shirt  and shorts  I'm prepared  because then we're  returning to the  to the prairie sir  then it is the  little house  on the prairie  so I've got to  step ahead of  everybody  then we go back  to calling people  half pint  stuff like that  half pint  paw  hey Kevin  switching gears  just a little bit  man  loving your movie  reviews  I mean  we finally got a guy  that you know  knows what he's  talking about  when it comes to  these movies  that are out 
[01:54:30]  on Ebert and Roper  yeah  yeah I mean  Anthony turned me  on to it  and you do  a really good job  yeah you know  it's actually  been kind of fun  I go back  one more time  this year  they asked me  to come back  to do  the worst of show  where they do  like you know  each one picks  ten movies  that they like  the least in the year  actually I guess  each one  since they both  see every movie  that comes out  they pick what  they seriously  consider the ten  worst movies  of the year  I haven't seen  every movie  that's come out  yeah  what was the worst  movie you saw  this year  I gotta hold it 
[01:55:00]  dude  I gotta save it  for the show  I can't bring it  big surprise  leave it in the  locker room  I like it the fact  that you got on  critics so badly  at one point  because they were  getting on you  and the critics  a few of them  were like  oh well you know  why don't you  give it a try  and then he  steps right in there  and kicks all their  asses  by doing a bang  up job  I thought the  departed was  really good  but a little  overrated  I like that  movie a lot 
[01:55:30]  a little overrated  a little overrated  a little overrated  did you guys  see Half Nelson  no  you see it  this movie  with Ryan Gosling  it's really good  that's the teacher  that's doing the drugs  I did see that movie  it was amazing  oh who saw it  which one  Opie  wasn't it great  yeah I got a  theater up in my  neighborhood  where they sell  smoked salmon  sandwiches  it's the artsy  theater  and I go there  when I'm just  sick of all the  crap that's out  and I saw Half Nelson 
[01:56:00]  it was amazing  I mean he was  fantastic  that kid  the little girl  she was fantastic  the dude who played  the dealer  the neighborhood  everybody  crossed the boards  great performance  it's a teacher  that the kids  absolutely adore  he's there for them  we've all had  one of these  teachers growing up  and the little  black girl  catches him  what was he doing  in the bathroom  was he snorting  I guess he was  snorting heroin  in the stall  and she catches him  he was a crack smoker 
[01:56:30]  he was on the  glass pipe  oh that's right  the glass pipe  basketball coach  and after the game  he thought everyone  was gone  he's in the bathroom  in the girls bathroom  like in a stall  smoking crack  that's how he deals  and they didn't  like what I thought  was cool about it  was they didn't  show you  like some heinous  things that had  happened to him  in the past  and that's what  led him to it  like there's one  scene where he goes  to have dinner  with his family  and it's so  uncomfortable  and both of his  parents are like  drinking like fish  and you kind of  get the idea  like alright  I can see how  a dude  who's pretty with it 
[01:57:00]  and pretty smart  could wind up  being this guy  it was just so  well done  but he's smoking  crack in the bathroom  and one of the  kids on his team  younger girl  walks in  and finds him  but it's one of  those movies  that like  unlike say  a dead poet society  it's not  mawkish  in terms of like  here's a teacher  that we love  and he's flawed  you know  like the  Robin Williams  flaw in that movie  was the system  didn't like him  because he's too  rebellious  Ryan Gosling's  flaw in this movie  is he's a  crack addict  and also 
[01:57:30]  let me ask you  what are the odds  because you're  a great director  and we all want  to see the  Chappie Sinclair  character brought  back with Lou Gossett  what are the odds  of doing  I mean  just talking about  a believable  interesting  well named character  Chappie Sinclair  what are the odds  of maybe doing  a Lou Gossett  you know  Iron Eagle  8  it's just an  inspirational film  and you always  root for Chappie  what are the odds  do you remember  the theme song  to Iron Eagle  I'm a bald douche 
[01:58:00]  comes to mind  but I don't think  that was actually it  it was a queen song  and it was like  lightning  I am lightning  sure you are  I think I saw  the last Iron Eagle  that was made  I'm not even sure  of the number  but recently  I watched it  it was on  late one night  was he in all of them  yeah he was  the sets  were hysterical  how cheap they were  he had a fight  in some room  that was just  I swear  it had to just  be paneling 
[01:58:30]  that was being  held together  with duct tape  the walls  were moving  it was just  I think the whole  budget had to be  about 50 bucks  Lou Gossett  I know this is  an odd thing  to talk about  in this day and age  does a great  performance  an officer  and a gentleman  and wins an Oscar  and then does  garbage  for 25 years  yeah but that's  that's where  that supporting  actor Oscar  and supporting  actress Oscar  is a curse man  you think it ruined  Timothy Hutton too  I just watched  here's a movie  if you haven't seen it  pick up this DVD  it's a movie called 
[01:59:00]  Shadowboxer  it's got Cuba Gooding  in it and Helen Mirren  who's right now  like everyone's going  she's going to win  the Academy Award  for Queen  the Queen  this is another movie  she was in this year  that came out  and limited release  it is so spellbindingly  awful  you have to watch it  it is not to be  believed  like he  him and Helen Mirren  Cuba Gooding  and Helen Mirren  play stepson  slash lover  hitmen team  who are hired  by Stephen Dorff  to go 
[01:59:30]  put a hit  on his girlfriend  who when they  go to shoot her  turns out to be  pregnant  and her water  breaks  and the movie  takes off  from there  you must  make the time  to see this movie  absolutely  but getting back  to Norton's point  yes  that thing  is a curse  man  like Mirren  Servino  what's the last  thing she did  yeah  yeah but don't  forget Enemy Mine  I forgot to mention  Enemy Mine  Enemy Mine  where he's  yeah  he's Dak  let's have sex  remember he has  he's self-generated  or what is it 
[02:00:00]  he's the  the organism  that impregnates itself  I don't know  I blocked it out  like a childhood episode  he has a kid  he has a child  he had a kid  Lou Gossett Jr  not to spoil it  his character dies  and so Dennis Quaid  has to raise  his alien kid  such a strange flick  that was odd  yeah we gotta  take a break  God damn  Clerks 2  on DVD  today  Clerks 2  is on DVD  and An Evening  with Kevin Smith  2 Evening Harder

[02:05:00]  you know  they throw out  one apology  and then forget  about it  this dumb  dummy  Michael Richards  is running around  like a chicken  with his head  cut off  apologizing to everybody  and in order  to keep it  in the light  it's just  never good enough  so now we  apologize  up the yim yam  and they're telling  him  not good enough  to boycott  the seventh season  buy three of them  at a clip  buy a copy  for every person  on your Christmas list  everyone gets  that for Christmas 
[02:05:30]  and let me tell you  by the way  blackmail  that crap  doesn't work  and you watch  the sales  of this  seventh season  of Seinfeld  good  it's gonna go  through the roof  you wanna give  your ancestors  a present  give them a copy  of season seven  season seven  season seven  what a gift  drop it near  that unmarked grave  wherever it was  anyway  speaking of  banning me  speaking of  banning the n-word  from movies  and stuff  well we got  some examples 
[02:06:00]  ah  good  you know  Pulp Fiction  Pulp Fiction  great movie  funny  and a great  use of the n-word  in that movie  constantly  if you ban  the n-word  you know  Pulp Fiction  that famous scene  would just be  a little different  now wouldn't it be  just a tad  Bonnie goes shopping  she buys  I buy the gourmet  expensive stuff  because when I  drink it  I want to taste it  but you know  what's on my mind  right now  it ain't the coffee  in my kitchen  it's the dead 
[02:06:30]  African-American  in my garage  oh Jimmy  don't even worry  no no no  don't think about  anything  I'm gonna ask  you a question  when you came  pulling in here  did you notice  a sign on the  front of my house  that said  dead African-American  storage  Jimmy you knew  I ain't seen  no  did you notice  a sign  in the front  of my house  that said  dead African-American  storage  no  I didn't  you know  why you didn't  see that sign  why  because it ain't  there  because soaring  dead African-Americans  they might  business  that's why  that's pretty good  it doesn't have 
[02:07:00]  the same impact  no  it really doesn't  it really loses  something  yeah well  we got a quick  I never liked  that scene anyway  because they made  his wife black  just to explain  like see  and it was kind  of corny  yeah  stupid  better than  true romance  that's where  the words  was perfect  oh yeah  see  true romance  get that clip  and throw in  African-American  well we're gonna  have a few more  tomorrow  but  oh I love  this guy  we got another  example from the  movie of course  Blazing Saddles  Blazing Saddles  who hasn't seen  Blazing Saddles  come on  Mel Brooks  Richard Pryor 
[02:07:30]  helped write that  one  yep  Cleavon Little  Cleavon Little  well you get  word of the  n-word  this scene  sounds a little  different  hold it  the next man  makes a move  that the African-American  gets it  hold it man  he's not bluffing  listen to him man  he's just crazy  enough to do it  drop it  I swear I'll blow this  African-American  head all over  this town  oh lordy lord  he's desperate  do what he says  do what he says  it just  you know  I  I'm not feeling it 
[02:08:00]  doesn't have the  same comedic  impact  the boys work  fast behind the  scenes  we'll have many  more tomorrow  we can guarantee  you that  and they'll enjoy  watching the movies  that they came from  they're gonna order  popcorn and pizza  and some beers  they're gonna stay up  all night for this bit  the godfather  Anthony  here's a quickie  and going with what  we said  you start with the  n-word  then you gotta  start banning  every other race  creed  religion 
[02:08:30]  everything is gonna  have to want  their word banned  too  with that in mind  here's something  from the godfather  let me tell you  something my  German-Irish friend  I don't remember  it sounding like that  it's not funny  at all that way  or this way  let me tell you  something  half German  and half Irish  friend  somehow  that line  was funny  when he said it  now  not funny  yeah  so  we'll have  many more tomorrow

[02:24:30]  opie and anthony  show  it's worse than  i imagined  that's terrible  i'm sorry  we are a bunch  of dopes  i think we're  lewd  we're probably  pushing 20  arrests because  of this radio  show  out of touch  corn balls  three retards  we have the  effect of  talenol  opie  you know i  can't have been  a model  anthony  i'm dead  james norton  i like yogurt  robert reed 
[02:25:00]  but enough of  this palaver  let's get the  show on the  road 
[02:25:30]  hey  hi everybody  it's the opie  and anthony  show  xm version  strictly xm  so any of you  niggers want to  call in and say 
[02:26:00]  cunch feel free  it's xm  satellite radio  wow how things  change with a  short walk  uh speaking of  that uh that  dreaded n-word  uh the laugh  factory banned  the n-word  every comedian  will be  be fee  will be f-i-e-n-d  who uses it  find  find  find  yes  no you got  the story  uh saw it on 
[02:26:30]  channel 11  call that dick  up  that can't be  uh true  the comics  should rebel  and just not  play his room  it should be a  rebellion  it's it's it's  freedom of speech  i'm gonna side with  jamie  and i'll tell you  why  i'm gonna punch  you  no no no  i have a reason  he's got a good  i agree with you  i do agree with you  he's got a good angle  on this actually  jamie is in a very  tough situation  and believe me  siding with a club 
[02:27:00]  owner  you really do feel  like the fucking  slave siding with  the master  but the reality is  he's in la  which is gang  territory  there's been race  riots there  he's getting death  threats and arson  threats  are you kidding me  he is worried  that someone's gonna  burn his club down  i'm telling you  that's what it is  self preservation  but on a real level  and in la  i mean he's probably  worried someone will do  a drive by at his club  i mean  that's a major problem  for him  and he's just trying  to weather this storm  because it's not  going away  and his 
[02:27:30]  as much as he loves  publicity  his insignia  is on every  fucking person  that watched  michael richard  yelling  sees laugh  factory behind  it  yeah that's  true  so i think  he's just  worried about  i don't think  he's trying to  restrict freedom  of speech  even though it  is pukey  los angeles  i think this  is just about  preserving  because masada  jimie masada  has been around  forever  he's seen a lot  of stuff over  the years  a lot of  great comics  he's just  reacting  some crazy  crazy stuff  i um  i would leave  it just the way  it is  you could use  whatever language  you can 
[02:28:00]  muster up  i don't care  if you use  the end  would that  be the  end result  do you think  i think  he's just  worried about  his club  getting the  windows  knocked out  or again  getting burned  down one  night  some fucking  maniac  burns you  down  in the laugh  factory  what about  this  masada  suggested  richards  donate at  least a half  a million  dollars to  charity  for every  time he  unleashed  the derogatory  term  masada  also said  the comedy  club will  ban comedians  from using  all hateful  words  all hateful 
[02:28:30]  words  wow  all right  fuck  them  that's  no  act  yeah  all hateful  words  you know what  they go to the  comedy store  yeah  there's no  act  which is right  down the street  from the laugh  factory  and i'm not  believe me  i'm not  saying that  the word  nigger should  be banned  from comedy  clubs  if there's  a place  for it  if you're  doing it  to be  gratuitous  like to me  that one  tarantino  scene  where he's  going  is this  dead  nigger  storage  he's  just trying  to be  the hip  white  guy  but in  true  romance  to me  it made  perfect sense  in the scene  it worked  i mean  that's why  that's what  it was there  for  i mean  you used  it where  it should  be used 
[02:29:00]  artistically  it was  great  what the fuck  is wrong  with jamie  miss  now he's  just panicking  here's another  quote  we want to be  the first place  in the world  can we get him  on the phone  today  let's try  we want to be  the first place  in the world  to ask all  of the comedians  if they go  on stage  and use  the n-word  it comes  out of  their paycheck  all right  we've lost  all reason  and sanity  if it's only  for that word  he is simply  panicking  and trying  to avoid  his club  from being 
[02:29:30]  burned  that's the  only word  i can understand  you know  something  for self  preservation  that's one  thing  but all  how about  you know  and i like  i'm saying  this  not being  in his  situation  but that  situation  there has  to be a  bit of  bravery  you're still  this is  the biggest  right  we have  in this  country  is the  freedom  of speech  the protection 
[02:30:00]  thereof  comes from  people  that gave  their lives  that were  very brave  to make  a stand  against this  kind of  thing  he is  cowering  buckling  under  and giving  in to  fear  and  forfeiting  a right  that you  have in  this country  he  it's easy  to say  because i'm  not in his  position  but  the guy's  a coward  he's a  coward  for his own  safety and 
[02:30:30]  protection  he is  taking away  the rights  of other  people  i agree with  you in a  sense that  it's  you're correct  you can't argue  the point  that is  correct  and i agree  that as an  artist  i agree  that of  course  but i do  understand why  he's doing it  i don't think  it's coming  from his heart  i think  that as soon  this is going  to pass  but right now  he's in the  middle of it  unwittingly  i mean he's  just there  and he's got to  react somehow  so when they say  what have you done  even though he  knows it's  horse shit  we ban the 
[02:31:00]  use of the word  nigger  comedians will be  fine  almost like saying  look that's all  i can do  so don't  fucking put  molotov cocktails  through my windows  i mean i don't know  if he's being a coward  because to me  a freedom of speech  issue which i agree  with you  is if it was a  political thing  or somebody was  criticizing blacks  and he buckled  i would completely  agree with you  but this is such  a violation  like uh  do you understand  of what is  like kind of  by standards  of what people  behave in public  he's just panicking  and trying to keep  his club from getting  fucking molotov cocktails  thrown through the window  he also jumped right  in the middle 
[02:31:30]  of this whole thing  i mean he didn't  shy away from this  you know he had  press conferences  with the logo  right behind  paul rodriguez  maybe he didn't know  it was going to  snowball  and paul mooney  he was thinking  oh great  i'm going to get  the name of my  club out there  this story's got  legs  yeah  big thin  kenyan legs  that can run  for miles  yeah and i'm not  saying i side  with the club owner  banning the word  nigger  i think it's  disgusting  but i won't go  as far as to  call him a coward  i don't even  work the laugh  factory so i'm  not sucking up  to him  when i'm in  la i work  the improv  the laugh  factory audiences  don't like me 
[02:32:00]  so i don't work  the club  i see it as a  bit of cowardice  though  maybe but  i mean  understandable  cowardice  you want to  think that  people are  are brave  and will  stand by  uh  their rights  and say  no i'm not  backing down  this this place  is especially  a comedy club  is really  that that last  stronghold of  free speech  in this country  where people  can go in  and say  and sit  and listen  to ideas  and language 
[02:32:30]  that you just  cannot hear  anywhere else  comedy clubs  really are  a very unique  place  for freedom  of speech  you sit  in an environment  where you can  hear things  that you will  not hear  outside those  doors  they are  taboo  and will get  you in trouble  outside those  doors  completely agreed  but had michael  richards been  doing a bit  and nigger  was the punchline  or he was using  it  i would be  a hundred percent  with you  but it came  it's such a weird  time in a comedy 
[02:33:00]  club  it's very rare  you have a white  guy yelling  we could have  hung you  there's niggers  in the back  it's very rare  you have this  kind of situation  this is a bizarre  i mean no one  said he should  go to jail  so his freedom  of speech  isn't being  violated  it's a very  odd situation  where you have  a guy screaming  something for real  at black people  but other people  other people's  freedoms are being  stepped on  because of this  now  him  the owner  you're banning  any  free  any  word  hate speech  well i don't like  any hate speech 
[02:33:30]  that's disgusting  you know  what about a comic  that really  in context  uses the word  nigger  and it's funny  and it's done  well  artistic  you're taking away  that comic's  right  to speak freely  in that establishment  and the people's  right to hear it  because of this  one instance  i think he's just  panicking  yeah  i think one thing  he doesn't want  is protest  against his club  which i don't  think there has  been any  but again  in la  you saw how  the white people  ran out  because it's  gang territory  la is a different  animal 
[02:34:00]  we don't deal  with that here  we don't deal  with guys  driving by  and shooting you  it's such a  fucking different  vibe out there  and they had  the riots  i mean there  was riots in  la we never  dealt with that  here in new  york  so they  i mean  it's almost  like  i'm trying  to put myself  in their shoes  and go look  it is a  legitimate thought  that his club  could be trashed  it's not a  crazy thought  let's go to  brooklyn  stupid kramer  brooklyn  what's up  what a douche  who the fuck  ever thought  that little  jimmy would  make 110%  sense  jimmy  gotta love you  brother  thanks  but you're 
[02:34:30]  right on the  mark  and it's a  shame  that  like that  woman who  called in  today  she can sue  me  because she's  a cunt  and if she  wants to  burn my  house down  but all they  want to do  is run  their freaking  mouth  about how  everybody's  oppressed  them  and then  you gotta be  afraid  that somebody's  gonna burn  your house  down  i'm like  you man  i'm just  like you  falling down  because you  called me a  truck driver  and burn  your house  down  they're such  fucking idiots  god bless you  guys man  it is disgusting  if he bans 
[02:35:00]  all hate speech  now if he bans  all hate speech  i'll try to  burn the club  down myself  you wouldn't  be able to  play in that  i would be  able to say  hello and  good night  as a comic  jimmy would  just go to  the comedy  store  so in the  end this  could hurt  him  who wants  to say  nice comedy  laugh factory  is that kind  of comedy  predominantly  that's why  i don't do  well  that's dane's  home club  they love  what dane  does  there's an  energy there  a fun  energy  that is just  the comedy  store is a 
[02:35:30]  hardcore club  and to me  the improv  i like better  the laugh factory  is just not  my vibe  so i lose  nothing by  not being  there  you still  got plenty  of clubs  that will  let you do  whatever the  hell you  want  i think  it's a  temporary  move  and i think  again once  the firestorm  dies down  it will  go away  this is just  a big one  man a guy  yelling nigger  and not in  being funny  but yelling  we could have  first of all  making some  sort of a  lynching reference  and then yelling  there's niggers  here  it's really hard  to fucking  just kind of  bypass that  one  you know  i mean he's  in a really  bad position 
[02:36:00]  certainly  and siding  with a club  owner  but i feel  like the  husband of a  rape victim  siding with  the rapist  they're repulsive  but i have  to on this  one  all right  let's say  hi to jay  who's black  and he lives  in alabama  hey how's it  going guys  how you doing  jay  how crazy  are you  to be black  living in  alabama  hey man  that's all  i know  i grew up  here  but hey  man look  you know  where i feel  i don't  i agree  with paul  mooney  on one  thing  and i 
[02:36:30]  know  don't  say  i do  agree  on one  thing  when he  was talking  to you  guys  the other  day  i wanted  to bite  my own  fucking  face  good point  then he  starts  fucking  up  real bad  oh  oh  i'm on  x  that's okay  yeah  um  the thing  was  when he  said  well  no  i don't  agree  with it  because  it's  dangerous  remember  when you  asked  was it  any  context  would  the word  nigger  be okay  well  look  he was  he was  dang  he is  exactly  right  it is  dangerous  and you  know  what  if the comic  wants to  take that  risk  to say  to stand  by  his 
[02:37:00]  art  so  fucking  be it  I agree  with everything  that we  do it  I can't  walk up  in Brooklyn  and call  an Italian  guy  some type  of fucking  mooc  or all  of this  kind of  crazy  without  getting my  ass beat  so you  know  I don't  have a  problem  with it  and I  live here  in Selma  Alabama  one of the  most racist  places in the  United States  and do you  know  that just  until about  four years  ago  we just  got that  same  mayor  that was  out  you know  in  bloody  Sunday  we just 
[02:37:30]  got his  ass  out of  office  so you  know  it's  still  alive  and  well  man  but  the  thing  about  it  you  got  to  know  what  you're  dealing  with  who  you're  dealing  with  and deal  with  you  raise  a good  point  like as a  comedian  if you  want to  take the  risk  I mean  because people  sometimes as comedians  we do think  that we have  barriers  like Michael  Richards didn't  seem to understand  that there are  guys that would  have walked  on stage  and knocked  his fucking  teeth out  like we do  have this  invisible barrier  which really  is if he  had done  that in a  mall  he would  have been  pounced  on and  beaten  there really  is a weird  barrier  which people  do cross  and smash 
[02:38:00]  you as a  performer  but as a  comedian  you're willing  to take  that risk  you have to  realize  you're dealing  with other  men  you know  women  usually  are not  going to  attack  you  physically  but  you're  dealing  with other  human  beings  who might  attack  you  I think  your barrier  there though  is the  art itself  the fact  that you're  on a stage  performing  and people  are in  front of you  as an  audience  it's almost  like you  get this  hey  why  doesn't  De Niro  get punched  for some  of the  language  he's  used  you know  you know  you kind 
[02:38:30]  of have  this  armor  on you  because  you're  a performer  but don't  you  is he still  there  sorry  I think  like as a  black guy  you understand  and I think  black people  sniff this out  immediately  from a performer  or anybody  else  when a white  guy is  saying nigger  just to be  shocking  or when there's  a real point  to it  like as a  comic on stage  I think  black people  in the audience  will accept it  if your point  is valid  if it's really  part of what  you're doing  and it makes  sense  if it's  bullshit  and it's  gratuitous  and you're  trying to  be shocking  and you're  trying to  use that 
[02:39:00]  shield  just to  say it  to a  black guy  they can  sniff it  out too  exactly  and Anthony  you know  what I want  to mention  one more  thing  you know  you say  how  you know  that we  that we  all should  have the  right to  say these  things  we actually  do  you know  what I'm  saying  but the  thing  about it  is  you know  the place  that this  came from  with him  and him  you can tell  that was  under his  skin  for a while  you know  what I'm  saying  you can tell  not only  from the  outburst  but from  his body 
[02:39:30]  language  and the way  he talked  during the  apology  and everything  you can tell  this guy  definitely  has got  some kind  of issues  I mean  that I  would never  even try  to argue  against that  one  that wasn't  a slip  of the tongue  that was  his anger  kind of  exposed  to what he was  you don't  come off  on a tirade  like that  he was just  annoyed  because black  guys probably  heckle him a lot  because he stinks  funny Kramer  mask came off  that night  and yeah  that was  Michael Richards  on the stage  thanks for calling  him  yeah thanks  Jay  alright man  I've been  listening  since Drill Doe  thank you  we haven't  played Drill Doe 
[02:40:00]  in a while  I love Drill Doe  we gotta get  some new  Drill Doe's  going on  I agree  one on me  one on fan  we'll see  they were awful  they stopped calling  they were pretty good  for a while  I know  and then we got  a couple bad ones  speaking of course  of live sex acts  on the phone  yeah  you know couples  would just call  and just start  going at it  and then they would  get the title  of sexiest state  in America  because they would  represent their state  yeah  Nick St. Louis  what's up  yeah what's up guys  Jimmy 
[02:40:30]  Jimmy I cannot  believe you  you do not  take a stand  on anything  that's not true  you have a weak chin  and a weak spine  that's not true  but I think you're right  one thing at a time  what are you talking about  what are you talking about  let me tell you  let me tell you  there is no room  for any grey area  on this one  you tell them  this is a temporary thing  not saying  the n word  the nigger word  whatever it is  any speech  should not be outlawed  unless it is speech 
[02:41:00]  that is to make  someone riot  or incite  I understand  well dude  wait  we'll go back and forth  I understand  what they call  I think it's TPM  time place and manner  and freedom of speech  I understand that  this is not about  the legal issue  of freedom of speech  okay  you can't stand  in a library  and yell cunt  without getting thrown out  either  so I'm not talking  about the legal issue  I'm not talking  I'm saying I understand  his point of view  because the reality is  it's real easy  to be a maverick  and sit here  and yell  yeah man  but I don't own the club 
[02:41:30]  that literally  there's a reality  he could be burned down  by some  I agree with you on that  but don't say  I don't take a stand  I said if he's banning  all hate speech  he's a fucking coward  if he's just banning  the word nigger  because he's afraid  of a Molotov cocktail  flying through his window  then he's reacting  to a bad situation  what kind of stand  would you like me  to take dude  no that's his right  as a business owner  but listening to you guys  because I love you guys  and you're my favorite comic man  but let me tell you something  listening to you say things like  well there's a difference  if somebody's saying 
[02:42:00]  the n-word  and then they're saying  it artistically  I don't care how they say it  I agree coming from  your point of view  as an artist  I don't find it funny  all the time  believe me  because sometimes  some of the race references  on this show  actually I'm like  oh that wasn't necessary  but sometimes it's funny  I think you're confusing  also the right to say it  and then the consequences  to the right to say it  like you can say it  and that guy can outlaw it 
[02:42:30]  in his own club  it doesn't mean it's outlawed  I mean you have the right  to say it  but it is his establishment  and he can outlaw  whatever word he wants  in his own establishment  it doesn't mean it's against  the actual laws  of this country  yeah it's not about  the legal issues  it's about you're on fire  which you're correct  he's talking about  his own policy  I'm all for his policy  and I'm all for his  rights as ownership  all I'm worried about  is you guys getting  caught up in the  agreeing  and this being  the first step  towards adding on 
[02:43:00]  Hey Nick  no no Nick  you're way off on that  you're completely wrong  you're way off on that  do you really think  I'm going to fold  no no  I'm not  it will be the last one  I'm the last fold out  don't you worry  I'm the Omega man  I just won't  Jimmy understands  the tough position  that Jamie Masada  is in  that's all  I do it for a living  I've been on stage  and there's a really weird  like you understand  as a performer  when you're going  somewhere with a person  where violence can happen  you do understand  that there's a really  weird thing 
[02:43:30]  like I've had things  with people in the audience  where the only thing  that kept us from fighting  was the fact that  I was talking to a microphone  and they were seated  in a chair  really bizarre  invisible wall  between you  I'm not going to be  a phony maverick though  and go fucking  say nigga  whenever you want  like I understand  why Masada  how can you say  I'm not taking a stand  on it  all I do is offer  horrible strong opinions  that have no room  for compromise  yeah and you know  Nick  Jimmy's home club  is the comedy seller  here in New York City  you know  if Estee all of a sudden  started banning  the n word 
[02:44:00]  and all these other words  make sure you tune in  the show  and see what Jimmy  has to say  because it would be  a whole different story  thanks guys  I appreciate the time  punch it out  the chin comment hurt  and if Jamie was  banning this word  because of just a few  letters or a few  complaints  but when Paul Rodriguez  I was agreeing  when Paul Rodriguez  said man  they're getting  arson threats  I'm like  yeah it is LA man  they fucking  10 years ago  the police had to stand  at Beverly Hills  so people didn't want  I mean it was scary  thank god 
[02:44:30]  so beautiful  Beverly Hills  are we getting Jamie  on the phone  he's not answering  I hope he's okay  no  he's probably laying down  with a black woman  hey  the dump report  we don't have to do  the whole dump report  but 607 from Anthony  Merry Christmas  fucko  was dumped out  why would they dump that  you should have said  happy holidays  I thought the O  would keep it okay  yeah  and we don't need  fucko  don't need explain or nothing  it's just fun to see  that Anthony got dumped out 
[02:45:00]  for saying Merry Christmas  fucko  fucko  alright we're gonna take a break  we got the razzle dazzle  variety hour  remember we asked for  some examples  razzle dazzle  I'm a douche bag  some of the new program  on  the virus  oh yeah  I forgot  they changed the name  of the channel  to the virus  also  Kramer rap  what's that  is it good  alright we got a lot  of things to do  Kramer rap  and is Big Kev still here  because we got his  interesting celebrity interviews 
[02:45:30]  interviews  from the last  con  he went to  the last convention  where they  parade out all these  D-list stars  who put this together  for us  Sam  Sam is a wise ass  Sam  let me just say  because I've talked  about this  Sam looks real innocent  yeah  out of everyone  in here  don't  I'm talking  everyone  the biggest scumbag  is Sam  the one that gets  the most pleasure  out of other people's  pain 
[02:46:00]  is Sam  the one that  tries to fuck  with people  more than anyone else  is Sam  well he's got a lot  of hate in his blood  as he should  half black  half white  big wide feet  giant cock  red cheeks  what the fuck  is wrong with him  it would have been okay  if he was half black  or half white  it would have been okay  because then one of the  groups would have  accepted him  but he's in that  category of  what the fuck  he looks like  he might be  American Indian  because of his lip shape  he just don't know  and he's got a lot  of hate  because of that  black hair  white cheeks  Sam's a fucking mess 
[02:46:30]  but he writes in  parentheses  Kev's been practicing  his radio voice  the label of the tracks  some of the labels  of the tracks  you're about to hear  after the break  actually  track one  Big Kev has a boring  conversation with Val Kilmer  this is all  editorializing on the  titles  yeah this is Sam  number two  track  Adam West talks to  Big Kev about his  upcoming projects  and then in parentheses  listen to Kev's  great seg  and his attempts  at humor  and then track three  is labeled 
[02:47:00]  according to Sam  Big Kev talks with  Dukes of Hazzard  star Catherine Bach  listen for Kev  not caring about  her first answer  as he moves  to his second question  wow  that's cool  you're a picky  patty over there  a picky patty  we'll get into that  we'll get into  or a nitpicky  well you know  we'll get into  some clips  from the  razzle dazzle  variety  razzle dazzle  we got Clinton  talking to the  AIDS puppet  today on TV  I want to hear that  we got a bull  getting tased  we got bacteria 
[02:47:30]  in airplane  bathrooms  great  lots of shows  still to do  I told you  the current  it boys of FM  talk are the  New York based  duo of Opie  and Anthony  and the talk  is racy  and raw at times  pushing the limits  as far as they can  show your hairy  pork chop  my mother smokes  crack rocks  I'm for drunk teens  what are you kidding  how about I lay you  down and give you  a little bukkake  we left  we're gonna have  a disgusting body  fluid blowout  gay porn  hey could you  soap up 
[02:48:00]  your bad place  the sluttier  the better  I would definitely  be willing to  have sex with you  if we both  already had AIDS  it's certainly  not your father's  talk radio  the Opie and Anthony  show is headed to  Florida  and you're not  tune in to the  Opie and Anthony  show Monday and  Tuesday morning  December 4th and 5th  as we broadcast from  the Buzz 103 FM  studios in West Palm  without you  if you're in the 
[02:48:30]  West Palm area  feel free to stop by  and watch the show  from a safe distance  that's Monday and  Tuesday morning  December 4th and 5th  live from West Palm  details on  Opie and Anthony  dot com  all right  back with the  Opie and Anthony  show  do we want to  razzle dazzle  do we want to do  Big Kev's really 
[02:49:00]  interesting celebrity  interviews  what do you want to  do what do you want  to do  we can probably do  both  we got to think  Kev here  I mean  it's very rare  to get the  actual  the interviewer  in studio  when the  riveting interviews  are being played  and these are  big celebrities  I don't think  they should wait  absolutely  these interviews  Big Kev doesn't  fuck around  with his interviews  I mean he could  take  Kev has a gift  he could take  any celebrity  and just make  them seem inane  no offense  no  none taken 
[02:49:30]  I'm sure  right  no  well the beauty  of the interviews  are the fact  that they're  less than two  minutes  I mean  he gets in  another in-depth  crap that some  guys go for  in and out  this is Big Kev  do you acknowledge  that you're Val Kilmer  yes I do  thank you  thanks for talking  to me today  you should do that  just for the fuck  of it  that'd be funny  to hear  okay  I climbed out  like a fucking  jewelry store  robbery  it's a stopwatch  we got two minutes  so Sam  tell me about  this movie 
[02:50:00]  and go  we should get  Sam in here  because the  fireworks could fly  Sam doesn't  like your work  there Big Kev  I hate to be  the bearer  of bad news  but Sam's  saying you're  not that good  at interviewing  I don't want  to upset you  but Sam said  that your stuff  stinks  you know  and Sam  would know  look at this kid  appley cheeks  sweet disposition  you'd think  look if it wasn't  for me  you would've  never known  that someone  thinks that  you're interviewing 
[02:50:30]  stinks  Fiona appley body  he is a waif  those are just  ideas that  popped into my head  oh don't be a pussy  don't be a pussy  we know you  we know you  have it in ya  editorializing  in the titles  of the tracks  it's what you  were doing  I love it  maybe  alright well  Big Kev  how is he a  black man  partially black  man with lips  like a Vietnamese  man  maybe part  Vietnamese  too  same as thin  lips 
[02:51:00]  but I hear  he's all cock  gotta respect this  he's a good boy  have we figured out  all of them yet  we know we got  the black  black and white  we got the white  we got the  American Indian  right  yeah I guess  part Jew  part Jew  you got some Jew  in ya  a little Jew  a little bit  a little bit  yep  none that I know  of  I see it  alright  it's there I guess  so young Sam  finds Kevin detestable  yes  Sam  paraphrasing  what do you mean  a lot  what do you mean by this  it says Kev's been  practicing his radio voice 
[02:51:30]  well Kev's voice  was made fun of  the last couple times  he presented his interviews  and it sounded like  he's sort of getting  that broadcast quality  to it  ah  perhaps it's because  of his numerous  podcasts  that he's been doing  that's true  yes  Sam is  listened to over at  bigkevsgeekstuff.com  that's a long name  bigkevsgeekstuff.com  at least it's memorable  close my mouth  the tongue  Sam is just better at it  than Club Soda Kenny is 
[02:52:00]  well no I'm just saying  that his voice  seems to have  broadcast quality  well more  we listen in  I'd like to say  that  oh boy  these interviews  this is the best part  of the bigkev  interview experience  I have a good one  this time  the Tuesday  so this would be  Friday and Saturday  I did these interviews  and on Tuesday  that week  I had five wisdom teeth  out  so I was on the  Oxycontin  all that weekend  oh  drugged out interviews  that was totally  I thought we only had  four wisdom teeth  I had a mutant 
[02:52:30]  fifth one  growing up  are you shitting me  no  I'll bring you the x-ray  wow  hey  can the boys get like  all of bigkev's excuses  for next time  that would be good  because he hasn't asked  before  every  time we do this segment  guys it was jet lag  it's fucking C-Caucas  oh yeah  but I just  look there were a lot  of people that  wanted time  with the guys  so you know  I figured  I only had a minute  hey that  that actually 
[02:53:00]  developed very nicely  into the  that was an excuse  though  you have many excuses  maybe we can find them  real fast  alright here we go  see what old great white teeth  had to  five wisdom teeth  he pulled one out  it grew right back  Sam writes  in this first track  Big Kev has a boring  conversation with Val Kilmer  so  it was really  not interesting  whatsoever  it wasn't the questions  oh  alright  well the questions  were terrific  you're saying  that's what I'm saying 
[02:53:30]  whatever it was  hey this is Big Kev  I'm at the National  Comic Convention  oh I hear a little bit  of that radio voice  yeah  the uh  by the way  National  not this local shit  Big Kev with ya  National  where were the  Big Kev  right across from  Madison Square Garden  to Penn Plaza  bigapplecon.com  oh  hey this is Big Kev  I'm at the National  Comic Convention 
[02:54:00]  and I'm here with  Val Kilmer  Val how are you  Val  not bad  how are you  I'm good  Val tell us  something about  Deja Vu  Deja Vu  I'm having one  right now  it's as though  we've met before  isn't it  Deja Vu  is a really  great role  he didn't want  to play anymore  he said I'm  having one right  now  you like set him  up to come  back at you  and do some  kind of Deja Vu  joke and he  just didn't want  to play  it's a movie  about  yeah  he said that 
[02:54:30]  he probably said  that in every  interview  and you're the  first guy to  try to take it  into like a  fucking Laurel  and Hardy  bitch  Kev wanted to  make a seven  episode miniseries  out of it  I did one line  he's done eight  times and you're  like all right  let's go with  that  he's like no  here's what  we will not  be friends  you're the  interview  I'm the  interviewee  it's as though  we've met  before isn't  it  Deja Vu  it was a  really great  role of  he totally  didn't even 
[02:55:00]  acknowledge  what you said  there wasn't  even like a  nervous titter  to make you  feel a little  more like  well anyway  the movie is  about just  like you  weren't even  fucking speaking  but let's  listen  why don't we  listen closely  here  again  having one  right now  it's as though  we've met  before isn't  it  Deja Vu  is really  great  I never  heard 
[02:55:30]  somebody's  eyes roll  before  it's as though  we've met  before isn't  it  Deja Vu  is really  holy shit  is that  great  not an  inkling that  you were even  in the room  it's as though  we've met  before isn't it  Deja Vu  is a really  great roller coaster  it's really fun 
[02:56:00]  movie  and  Tony Scott  just never  fails to deliver  and  I just heard  the other night  that Jerry  Bruckheimer  has amassed  50 billion  dollars for  his employers  isn't that crazy  that is crazy  I mean he really  knows what  people want to see  and it's  it's just a really  fun movie  can you tell  us just from  a personal  point of view  what it's like  being recognized  for the great  one of the  greatest westerns  ever  your performance  as Doc  Holiday  in Tombstone 
[02:56:30]  I had such  a great time  my mom lives  in Arizona  and love  Kurt Russell  and it's kind  of a love story  you know  these two guys  that couldn't  be more different  Doc Holiday  is a guy  that had his  life and  he knew he was  going to die  when he moved  out west  because he  had tuberculosis  and he met  a man that  was honorable  and had  brothers that  he cared  about  so Doc  Holiday  found a  family 
[02:57:00]  so it's  a really  moving story  we saw it  about  Jesus  10 year old  movie  it's a true  story and that's  why people love  it I think  awesome  that's Val  Kilmer here  at the  National  wow  awesome  maybe overstating  it a bit  wow  hey that's one  of my favorite  movies  it's one of the  best performances  I've ever seen  in a film  yeah I'm sure  it's fantastic  I was very  excited to actually  just get him  to talk to say  anything about  I don't blame  you a bit  but awesome 
[02:57:30]  I'm saying  may not have  been  how about  bringing up  Iceman  in Top Gun  yeah  yes  when you  clenched your  teeth in the  locker room  surprised you  remembered his  name I would have  said awesome  that was  melatonin  wow  was he a  bore  Val Kilmer  is a bore  ready for  track 2  bring him on  the Adam  West interview  Adam West  come on  the original  TV  Batman  this will be  good  this is how  it's labeled  how is it 
[02:58:00]  labeled  this is how  it's labeled  by Sam  here  Adam West  talks to  Big Kev  about his  upcoming  projects  listen for  Kev's  great seg  and his  attempts  at humor  that doesn't  mean jokes  were good  by the way  when you say  listen for  someone's  attempts  at humor  that doesn't  mean put  your laughing  hat on  Sam  comment  well  Big Kev  breaks the  formula here  from his  minute interviews  as he goes  about two  minutes  wow  and he really  fills that  time  in depth  were the jokes  good  no  no  I didn't  find them  to be good 
[02:58:30]  I love that  Sam  out of his  shell  what a  fucking  little  creepy  looks like  a turtle  out of his  shell  certainly  does  fucking  little  little  red  cheeked  slug  boy  just  shitting  all over  Big Kev  I think  Adam West  as a cultural  icon  deserved  two minutes  instead  well Adam  West  very recognizable  yeah cultural  icon  a poor man  William Shatner  yeah there you  go  here we go  hey this is 
[02:59:00]  Big Kev at  the National  and I'm here  with superstar  TV legend  Adam West  Adam how are  you  pretty good  shape Big Kev  Adam I hear  that you have  a bunch of  superstar may  not be good  yeah  do you realize  the last time  he was on  television  blacks couldn't  vote  that's not  true Jim  all right  we're gonna be  literal with  some humor  wow  what are the  facts  he's uh  he's actually  has a reoccurring  role on family  guy and he's  uh going on  the George  Lopez show  this year  as he'll  again in the  interview 
[02:59:30]  as Jim said  from being  Batman  to he'll be  appearing on  the George  Lopez show  back to you  Kev  he's not on  TV if he's  a reoccurring  character  I like the  volley here  but I think  Jimmy just  smashed one  right down  the sideline  when he said  I hate to  disagree  I'm like  okay  it must be  some television  roles  well he's  on a cartoon  and he will  be on the  George  Lopez show  I bet you  were leading up  a little bit  he also has  a game show  in development  what's it  called  who am I  I suspect  yes  after 40 
[03:00:00]  years  it's no longer  a hiatus  off TV  I don't want  to be picky  but  why the  distortion  in the  interview  you're a  broadcaster  at this point  I had a  technical  difficulty  there  it sounded  loud  there  was it  loud  so you  might have  been talking  into the  mic a little  louder  than you  should have  been  over  modulating  he was  pinning  the needle  I didn't 
[03:00:30]  compensate  enough  I'm learning  let's take a  listen  hey this is  Big Kev  at the  national  and I'm  here with  superstar  TV legend  Adam West  Adam how are  you  pretty good  shape  Big Kev  Adam I  hear that you  have a bunch  of upcoming  projects  can you tell  us about  some of  them  Big Kev  I got a  bunch  I hear  you're  going to  be doing  a reoccurring  character  on the  dream  wow  what a  doll  we're  going to  summarize  shitbox  it's an  interview  you fucking  cocksucker  can you help  me out here 
[03:01:00]  Hendry  I got a  bunch  do you  also have  a bushel  you fucking  farmer  I've got  a bunch  I've got  a metal  project  and his  head was  empty right  then  it's awful  he's trying  to think  what project  can I say  I have  he gets  into all  of them  give him a  chance  to the  project  cave  let me  look  no it's  empty  I hear  you're  going to  be doing  a  reoccurring  character  on the  George  Lopez  show  yeah  that's  really  fun  you know  a lot  of people 
[03:01:30]  actors  others  say  hey  that was  fun  to do  you know  but  many times  work is  not fun  you know  you make  it fun  if you  can  but I  gotta  tell you  George  Lopez  is a  fun  guy  he's  the  greatest  and  he's  the  greatest  Batman  fan  yeah  but we  got along  wonderfully  and it  it was  a good  role  and  something  I  could  get  my  comedic  teeth  into  shut up  and you  sink your  comedic  teeth  into the  role  of the  mayor 
[03:02:00]  oh  no  a  segway  that's  the  thing  that's  so good  about  yeah  sink your  comedic  teeth  and they  ripped out  with  polydent  strings  going to  his  roof  of his  mouth  I wonder  if he  had an  extra  fucking  comedic  tooth  he had to  have removed  fucking  first of all  George Lopez  looks like  Burt Ward's  cock  I'm tired  of him  someone off  their cell  phone  did anyone  else notice  that Adam  West is a  superstar  but Val  is just 
[03:02:30]  Val  yeah  Val  yeah  well  superstar  and something  I could get  my comedic  teeth into  and you  sink your  comedic teeth  into the role  of the mayor  on Family  Guy  Family Guy  has been  an amazing  project  you know  it's one  of the only  shows  or maybe  the only  one  that the  fans ever  brought back  with just  making a lot  of noise  right  and I think  it really  paid off  I hear you  also have  an upcoming  Disney movie  yes I did 
[03:03:00]  chicken little  and now  I'm doing  meet the  Robinsons  right  speaking of  little  you haven't  been on  television  in quite  a while  what's been  happening  with your  career  I'm just  thinking  a different  segway  you could  have used  I'm taking  mental notes  he was  looking around  for the  bat signal  to get out  of this  fucking  interview  where's  commissioner  Gordon  when I  need him  I know  you look  fuck  you look  over the  clouds  it's just  a fucking  head on  a pillow  with Z's  coming out

[03:04:30]  Batman  as a  character  Adam West  yeah  not that  Batman  no no no  I mean he's  played  he's known  yeah but  that was a  goofy send up  I don't mean  that I don't  mean he was  the greatest  as Batman  I'm saying  he's known  as Batman  right  he's Batman  I don't give a  fuck  there's a lot  of new guys  he's the goofy  TV Batman  fine but he's  still Batman  if you look at  him he's Batman  I like him  better than the  other ones  superstar  yeah but he's  Batman  superstar  that's what  I say  dark shit  sniffer from  Woodside  Kev should have  kept his  wisdom teeth 
[03:05:00]  that idiot  all right  get those  implanted  back in  going to  last  but if  if we feel  that they have  any longevity  then I think  we'll go for it  hey if Shatner  can do one  why not you  oh  who  oh you just  put me in the  best company  there  I mean another  icon  that is Adam  West here at  the National

[03:06:30]  Katherine Bach  all right  give us a little  background because  we know  Katherine Bach  the original  Dukes of  Hazzard from  television  she was the  hot cousin  I guess  and Daisy Duke  who the  Daisy Dukes  were actually  named after  correct  Jessica Simpson  playing it in  the movie  the little  Daisy Dukes  and stuff  we remember  her beautiful  ass on there  but what's  her name  Barbara  Katherine Bach  Barbara Bach  was Ringo's  wife  yeah  Katherine Bach  so gotta be

[03:07:30]  my cock in the  grill of the  charger  Jesus Christ  and there it is  back on track  alright well  what happened  so no Daisy  Dukes  I'm 20  what  was it 25  27 years ago  well stop eating  the pie  that's right  remember you as a  hot piece of ass  make sure you can  still fit for the  Daisy Dukes  wear those cunt  huggers  if I may  that's what you  should have said  to her  you should have  been real polite  and said look  it's good to see you  but how does it feel  to know that so many  American girls  wear cunt hugging 
[03:08:00]  shorts like you did  when are you going to  lose it  Big Kevin  ask the real question  yeah  real hard hitting  hey you know  I don't want to lose  these opportunities  to bring you  these  unbelievable opportunities  they're all about  the fluff  wow  they're all about  the fluff  I don't want to  lose Hollywood  they're lining up  at Best Buy  to get their XM  because of this  he ought to do  another show  called lack of  entertainment tonight  that's lovely  thank you 
[03:08:30]  alright here we go  listen for Kev  not caring about  her first answer  as he moves  to his second  question  comment Sam  just seemed like  Kev had two  questions in mind  and regardless  of her first answer  he was going  for the second  question  you know  I have a format  that I use  and you know  we got to stick  to that format  take the wig  from fullblown  aids.com  just simply writes  Daisy pukes  no Daisy  should puke  a little more 
[03:09:00]  so she can get  into her dukes  Adam's a very nice  older woman  older woman  you should ask  the real questions  like where are  the shorts  I mean come on  the whole country  is sorry  did you ever get  a yeast infection  from those things  pushing up  into your cunt  I couldn't ask  a question like  that  how was  what was she  wearing  was it anything  sexy  no it was  it was a nice  a tracksuit  probably  like a pantsuit  a pantsuit  that famous 
[03:09:30]  Daisy Duke ass  what does it look  like these days  it's easier to see  there's a lot  more of it  great  is that it  she's a very nice  older woman  is what she  time stinks  time does  stay  what's the  worst question  you would ask  her  if you could  do you think  that General Lee  could jump over  that fat ass  I don't know  I don't know  why don't we  just take a listen  here  hey this is  Big Kev  I'm here at 
[03:10:00]  the National  with TV  hottie legend  Catherine Bach  from the Dukes  of Hazard  how are you  Catherine  you had to say  hottie  legend  hottie  slash legend  he's not like  Carson in 1978  we're here with  Catherine Bach  she'll be sitting  on Jim Fowler's  shoulder  she brings a  falcon out  and it eats  worms out of  her cunt  may your five 
[03:10:30]  wisdom teeth  fall out  I don't think  she wanted to be  called hottie  legend  no  that means  she's not  a hottie anymore  I think maybe  she's ready  for the old  timers game  former legend  and now  old fogey  why didn't you  say you know  the last time  someone jerked  off to you  Gerald Ford  was falling  down the steps  there we go  hottie legend  oh boy  hey this is  Big Kev  I'm here at  the National  with TV 
[03:11:00]  hottie legend  Catherine Bach  from the Dukes  of Hazard  how are you  Catherine  hi Kev  I'm great  how are you  I'm great  thank you  what are you  up to  these days  you know  I'm busy  raising my  family  which is  for all you  women out there  you know  how hard  that is  I'm doing  that but  I'm loving  it  I've got  a few  projects  I'm just  now that  the kids  are a little  older  starting to  get back  to work  I guess  started on  the episode  of Monk  on an episode 
[03:11:30]  of Monk  oh  you know  what  I remade  the song  Waylon Jennings  song  Just a Good  Old Boy  with John  and Tom  my co-stars  from Dukes of  Hazard  and that's  going to be  on CMT  and it's also  going to be  oh my god  she didn't  get me that  immediately  I need a  copy of that  you know  she's going to be  in the video  and they're only  going to show  her eyes  oh yeah  two feet  and two eyes  oh my god  oh she  fucking  finished  John Schneider 
[03:12:00]  and Tom  Wolpat  and her  are re-recording  the theme  to the Duke  of Hazard  and it's going  to be played  on the country  music television  holy fucking  disaster  wow  and that's  going to be  on CMT  and it's also  going to be  the inner  jacket  of the new  box set  of DVDs  wow that's  awesome  can I ask you  how do you feel  about Jessica  Simpsons portrayal  of the character  wow that's awesome 
[03:12:30]  in other words  it's not awesome  at all  it couldn't be  farther from awesome  if it tried  it's miles from awesome  I have to keep  the interview moving  and keep my  personal editorials  out of it  awesome really  gets overused  do you know  you have to be  in awe of something  for it to be awesome  yeah  or on drugs  you are in awe  of the fact that  John Schneider  Tom Holpat  and Catherine  Bach recorded  the theme 
[03:13:00]  to the Dukes  I was in awe  of shiny objects  for four or five days  so that was great  DJ ate a light bulb  from Post Horse  Big Cass  should have asked her  if she ever got  her labia  caught in her zipper  now that's  a good question  that's what  everyone wants to know  absolutely  those are the  hard hitting questions  and then Redding  from Whackbag  is Kev reading  off cue cards  he is over pronouncing  every word  no I'm trying  to be a responsible  broadcaster  yeah 
[03:13:30]  alright well  here we go  you should have  said Catherine Bach  who played  Boss Hog  really  throw her  just as a goof  alright I'm gonna  stop this next  I'm gonna stop  this next question  before the answer  alright  awesome  can I ask you  how do you feel  about Jessica Simpson's  portrayal of the  character you created  on the original  Dukes of Hazzard  oh I'm sure  she feels just  great about that  I  let me think  you reminded  how hot she used 
[03:14:00]  to be  let's guess  she didn't like  it  don't tell us  Kev  I'm saying  she didn't  really like it  because it was  a little too much  her character  while it left  more to the  imagination  Jessica Simpson  character  a little too  much exposed  and a little  too much  feisty  blah blah blah  now I'm gonna  go into the  opposite and say  I think she's  gonna say  I think she did  a terrific job  she was really  perfect as  I think she's 
[03:14:30]  gonna be the  Hollywood schmaltz  yeah  and I hope  in this question  you at least  refer to her  as old  lemon cunt  he didn't see  it  so I  I don't really  have a comment  but I do think  that she seems  like a  what  she didn't  see it  she's gonna  schmaltz  what a liar  I don't believe  that  she's gonna  schmaltz  wait she wasn't  in the movie  so she's bitter  so now she's  gonna tell her  she didn't see  the movie  not as bitter  as Cooter  Cooter's real  bitter  he didn't  he don't like  the movie  at all  he was boycotting  I find it really 
[03:15:00]  hard to believe  that they didn't  at some point  it's been out  on DVD forever  and I find it  really hard to believe  that none of them  because according  to what she told  me after the fact  as far as she knows  that not really  none of the people  have seen it  all the way through  or they were sent  clips or something  like that  that's such a lie  that's a lie  liar liar  big fat pants  on fire  let's say they do  a movie about  the Opie and Anthony  show  but they don't  invite us to do  a cameo in it  we're much older 
[03:15:30]  and stuff  we're gonna sit  at home and not  watch the Opie and  Anthony movie  I wouldn't  you think I don't  want to see how  Tom Cruise plays me  sorry I didn't  mean to laugh  too hard  it'd be hurtful  if I laughed  too hard  here's the answer  see it  so I don't  really have a comment  but I do think  that she seems  like a sweet girl  why didn't you  see the movie  I haven't had a chance  everybody out there  that has kids  and a busy life  knows it's not  that easy  Catherine Bach  very busy lady  thank you so much 
[03:16:00]  wait you have kids  and I'm gonna be  looking for this  you don't have time  to watch a movie  you'll find it  you lying cunt  don't have time  to watch a movie  because she's  raising kids  what are they  monkeys  she's lying  they're shitting  and throwing it  at her  she has to duck  and they put  feces in my VCR  she's lying  she certainly is  alright big Cav  there you go  I have to give her  butthole a good  fingering her  straighten her right out  Daisy Duke  give her a good  buggering  what are the next

I just saw somebody walking away  did he look about  I don't know  like he's 58 years old?  no  I heard some guy talking  no  I can tell you're not  being sincere  because you don't know  what to do with your hands  right now  and what he said was  that's not the way he talks  he said  I'm 58 years young  57 actually  I'll be 58 in March 
[03:22:30]  I used to babysit you  I worked with your father  and I got fired  I had a niece  who was a bit of a tattletale  she was 2 years old  and she made up allegations  about what I would do  when I was babysitting  oh my god  I can't even look at it  I know  it's really creepy  because the voice  doesn't sound like him  not at all  I remember  when you was a little girl 
[03:23:00]  maybe you was  9 or 10  and you come to me  and you says  Uncle Paul  I got hairs growing  down here  I explained to you  that your body  was changing  you are awful  gives her the willies  oh no doubt  you think  gives us the willies  you can't even hear  like Jim Norton  in there at all 
[03:23:30]  no  do you go to another place  when that voice starts  I don't know  where do you do it  do you kind of do it  in her ear  or is it sitting  next to her on the couch  or  like where  where do you do that  let's say we hug in  or something  and I may put my lips  to her ear  yeah  and go  you know your mother  was always an attractive woman  your father and I  had an argument  one time  because he said  I was being inappropriate  towards her and you 
[03:24:00]  she really gets discouraged  oh my god  oh god  Jimmy I love it  greatest character ever  people are saying  horrible  oh she gets really creeped  she's a tough one  to creep out too  I couldn't believe  she never should have  let me know  and that one bugs her  leave it to you  to find something  oh  she fucking tickles me  it's so  I'm really throwing myself  but she pokes me  we're joking  with each other  I'm very ticklish  and I go  let's have little names 
[03:24:30]  for each other  and she's like  okay how about Ribsy  and she just starts  jabbing her finger  into my ribs  and it really hurts  like tickles  so we'll be out in public  and she's so obnoxious  so she starts calling me  Ribsy and tickling me  and it sounds kind of  faggity  but I'm like  in a restaurant  I'm like  come on  stop  stop  and it's really  fucking embarrassing  she really doesn't  give a fuck  so I had to  find one  I'm glad  she can embarrass you  yeah she can  yeah  that's good  because you  do nothing  but embarrass  everybody you're with  yeah  that seconds me 
[03:25:00]  hey before we play  some clips  from the razzle dazzle  variety hour  by the way  everyone's saying  another guy  Dennis D from Jersey  wow that character  is fucking brilliant  oh  here's a quickie  it's the Kramer rap  that is making its way  around the internet  sweeping the nation  sweeping the nation  yes  very viral  this thing  listen to this  if you haven't heard it  yet before  that is racism  I'm not a racist  that's what's so insane  about this  I'm not a racist 
[03:25:30]  that's what's so insane  about this  oh my god  I'm not a racist  that's what's so insane  about this  I'm not a racist  That's what's so insane about this. 
[03:26:00]  He's a piece of trash.  Lee Edward.  He's black, isn't he?  He is?  I'm black.  I thought he looked Irish.  What's his last name?  That's not Irish.  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this. 
[03:26:30]  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this.  He's black, isn't he?  I'm black.  I'm not a racist.  That was the worst father you've ever seen.  I should say that I don't have to worry about working for a while.  A long while.  Wow, that's really good.  That's a great job.  A great job.  What's his name?  Nigga!  You want that for your iPod, Jimmy?  That's fucking...  Yes, I do, actually.  I'd love to play that in my car real loud. 
[03:27:00]  It's a good one.  All right.  Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  We need a little background on this.  Getting mixed reviews, by the way.  Some people think it's really, really good, and other people think it stinks.  I would probably lean, then, toward it stinks.  Have you heard it yet?  It's not a peep.  It's not a peep of it.  Razzle Dazzle.  Why did they pick Razzle Dazzle?  Is it because of Steve's promo that he did?  Yeah, we were just working around. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Razzle Dazzle.  So it's dumb things like we did Best of the Walkover as part of this Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  Best of the Walkover.  We have this new bit called When the Mics Are Off.  See, they're not ever off.  Yeah.  Even when we go to commercial breaks, the mics are still on.  Right.  So, whoa, Steve.  Hey.  So it's the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  Could you say Razzle Dazzle like you do in production pieces?  Oh, you mean for the Ron and Fizz thing? 
[03:28:00]  Just say Razzle Dazzle.  Just work yourself up.  Get a good one.  And I want to hear you say just Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  Like that one?  No, that's stupid.  Oh, give us a little.  Razzle Dazzle.  That's it.  Go ahead.  Razzle Dazzle.  God, is that stupid?  Is it?  I didn't think of it.  I just did it.  Razzle Dazzle.  I was just following instructions.  How the fuck year is this?  I don't friggin' know.  I didn't get it.  You're watching Ronan Martin's laughing? 
[03:28:30]  I don't get half the stuff I get handed by those guys.  I just say it.  Yeah.  You just say it.  You're a good soldier.  Here's Steve.  The Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour Best of the Walk intro.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh my God.  Now, on the Opie and Anthony virus, it's the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  Holy fuckaroni.  It's hokey and it's fucking boring.  Yeah, this is fucking normal.  You would have to be a drooling retard to accept anything that's happening 
[03:29:00]  in this show.  It's just a bunch of white disasters.  It's absurd.  Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot.  Walking isn't supposed to be difficult, yet we've figured out how to screw it up.  It's the worst of the walk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there's no walk clips.  No walk audio.  Because there's no best off on the walk clips.  Yeah.  Because nothing's happened that anyone would care about. 
[03:29:30]  That was kind of the point we tried to make when we were having these discussions about it.  But no one wanted to listen to you, right Steve?  Nobody wanted to listen.  Yeah.  They see things that are not there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  When the mics are off.  This was actually played during the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  Razzle Dazzle.  Supposed to be longer form pieces, but we listened to them.  Well, this is stuff that's not supposed to be on the air because it's just us shooting  the shit while we're waiting to go back on the radio. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  But then they got the bright idea that this would actually be interesting.  Yeah.  And I would say if it was interesting, wouldn't we just throw it on the air to begin with?  Hmm.  Are you following me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But maybe it is interesting because you're catching us like not realizing that the mics  are off.  I don't know.  Ah.  Maybe it's voyeuristic to some people out there.  Sure.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony, my favorite radio show on XM.  The great minds at the Opie and Anthony show are always planning the next great moment 
[03:30:30]  in radio history.  To capture these brainstorming sessions, we've developed When the Mics Are Off, a voyeuristic  journey behind the scenes of the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's Anthony yelling at somebody through PalTalk.  What happened to the audio?  Where's the audio?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Where's the audio?  Oh, I'm sorry.  You dumb fuck. 
[03:31:00]  Sometimes we start the audio off sometimes.  Sometimes it's going to turn off.  Here's hoping the next time we leave the microphones on during a break, we get something worthy of  blackmail.  Stay tuned for another edition of When the Mics Are Off.  When the Mics Are Off.  I listen.  I would listen to that all day.  That's not a bad thing.  I would listen to When the Mics Are Off all day.  Yeah.  It's quick.  It's highly produced. 
[03:31:30]  Because our guard is down.  Yeah.  There's Anthony just making retard sounds.  Because people don't understand with the PalTalk on, they could hear us during commercials.  Right.  Just like When the Mics Are Off.  You know, it still runs during PalTalk.  But sometimes I shut the mic off.  Right.  Because we're discussing things.  Well, here's another example of when the mics are off.  Whoa.  I have chitty porn on my computer.  I have chitty porn on my computer.  I have chitty porn on my computer.  We're in commercials right now.  Oh, wow.  That's actually my computer. 
[03:32:00]  I have chitty porn on my computer.  I have chitty porn on my computer.  I have chitty porn on my computer.  I have chitty porn on my computer.  Oh, my God.  I thought somebody hooked that mic up to my subconscious.  That's, yeah.  That's my phone ringing again.  We're back live.  This isn't when the mics are off.  That has got me.  Maybe you ought to change that.  You want to talk about embarrassment.  I talked about the time online at the bank.  And then when I had to go to the psych ward and I was in the elevator with a bunch of doctors, 
[03:32:30]  it went off as well.  Good for you, balls.  It's kind of.  All right.  So another example of when the mics are off.  I guess it's myself here eating.  Whoa.  Sleep.  We're in commercials right now, and usually a real radio show.  We'll discuss what they're going to do next.  But we eat fruit during commercial breaks.  Listen to the goodness of a pineapple. 
[03:33:00]  Jimmy, would you like to share your goodness with everybody?  I'm going to see you.  Jimmy eats very safe when he flies.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's grapefruit. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, my God.  It's grapefruit salad.  Want some sugar?  Oh, I want some sugar.  Eating fruit.  Wow.  That was fucking riveting.  Stay tuned for another edition of When the Mics Are Off.  Horrible.  Dude, I'm going to...  When the Mics Are Off.  Who would listen to that crap?  Especially when it's dumb production.  I wouldn't have said fucking there.  Huh?  Why?  I would have said...  Because that was riveting.  Sounds more announcer-ish. 
[03:34:00]  Okay.  Thank you, Jimmy.  But how he wraps it around and just beats us up is pretty good.  I wouldn't listen to that crap.  Stan, how long did you have to listen?  How much audio did you have to listen to to pull out that 30 seconds, whatever that  was?  Ten minutes.  Thank you.  Basically, when the mics are off, there's nothing going on.  Well, we're eating and doing nothing.  It sounds a lot like when the mics are on.  Here's another one.  When the mics are off, Sam's blackness is disgust. 
[03:34:30]  Oh.  There's no one else in the world is...  He's just black.  He is just black.  You put, like, one more drop of white blood in him, and he would be a white guy.  It's that hair.  It's that face.  It's the eyebrows.  It's something going on, man, with you.  It's just something...  You know who you look like?  You look like Bizarro Todd Berry.  Oh, my God.  Don't do that to him. 
[03:35:00]  He's too young for all that.  Put it this way.  Will he be chased around in the 60s?  No.  Yeah, maybe.  Will they try to hang him in the 60s?  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, we sincerely apologize for the last 36 seconds.  You won't be getting them back.  Stay tuned for another edition of When the Mics Are Off.  Dude, it is so bad, it's good.  Who's complaining about that?  I don't know.  It's only aired once.  It's so bad, it's good.  I kind of like the mics off.  Yeah, okay. 
[03:35:30]  Because it is really...  And it's presented like it's shit.  Yeah, that's what saves it.  You're just beating us up after you hear this awful audio.  Yeah, that was the conversation that Ope and I had.  I called him up when we started cutting up the audio.  I said, Ope, I hate to break it to you, but there's nothing here, man.  This sucks.  This really stinks.  And he was like, well, then presented is that.  Presented is shit.  It's total shit, and you know it's shit.  I was like, all right, done.  Dish up.  Some shit.  Lee Abrams would teach you a few things when he's not flying his plane very, very high. 
[03:36:00]  There are times that he's actually completely sober and has some interesting things to say.  When?  And one of the things he would tell you if you were a radio broadcaster is to make sure  you're never average.  Make sure you're either really, really good or really, really bad.  Extremely good.  That's a great example of being really, really bad.  It's true.  Which makes it interesting to listen to.  John in Philly, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I want to tell you, man.  Those fucking, um... 
[03:36:30]  This razzle-dazzle variety hour, it's fucking sweet.  I deliver pizza, right?  Yeah.  I deliver pizza, and I just get to listen to you guys fuck around all day, and it's great.  I've been a fucking XM listener for, uh...  Man.  Since I had to pay for it, dude.  All right.  Thank you.  Good.  I like it.  Hey, someone was saying, uh...  This is the guy that told us yesterday when the mics are off is brilliant, and he wants  to know, did we play the Patrice King Kong one?  Do we have that?  Uh...  We can get it.  It was...  That was the fourth of the fourth piece. 
[03:37:00]  Is it good?  Yeah.  Just a little longer.  It's just a little longer.  Oh, yeah.  Let's listen to it.  The other ones are around like 30 seconds.  Because we haven't heard it.  And then, of course, the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour outro.  This concludes the Razzle Dazzle Variety Show.  Ye effin' ha.  That is just horrific.  Well, it looks like someone's getting fired.  Tune in next week for more Awful 10 a.m. Saturday with replays throughout the weekend.  Obie and Anthony.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  Indeed. 
[03:37:30]  All right.  Here's another one.  The mics are off.  This is Patrice, I guess.  The great minds at the Opie and Anthony show are always planning the next great moment  in radio history.  To capture these brainstorming sessions, we've developed When the Mics Are Off, a voyeuristic  journey behind the scenes of the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's Patrice talking about King Kong.  Let's listen in, shall we?  That shit's so perfect.  That new King Kong that was like, oh my god, this is so fucking, oh, it's just heart-wrenching. 
[03:38:00]  That scene where he, that scene after he fought the Tyrannosaurus, and he was just standing  there, still breathing heavy, and he just dismissed them.  Tell me, you fucking, tell me, he pulled a bitch, that's how you get, he did all that.  That's how you get a bitch.  And she's just standing there all like, and she's all getting into her all about me mode, 
[03:38:30]  and he just, he just started to leave.  And she's like, wait, motherfucker, because she saw what the real monster was.  Yeah.  Them Tyrannosaurus was like, ooh, I'm going to eat this thing here.  That fucking, they weren't going to pick her up and stroke her hair.  And they wasn't going to do a James Bond villain thing where they go, mm, sweetie, you look  a little shit there.  They was going to bite her fucking head off.  That's it.  And he fought, and she's like, wow, this motherfucker ain't the monster. 
[03:39:00]  Then she's like, okay, I'm going to dance for you, because that's what you want me to  do.  And he's like, she's like, hello, titties, pussy.  And it's just like, you don't even know, bitch.  Look at that right there.  She's like, I've never seen no son of you.  And she's like, man, if I could suck his dick, I would.  Yeah, there was a little logistics problem between those two, but.  And she just climbed on her tip and slide down, climb back up, slide down, like the bat  pole. 
[03:39:30]  Just jerk him off.  Yeah, with an umbrella, waiting for the money shot.  Put a trampoline on his balls and slide up, slide up.  Yeah, we'll do it.  Just work it out.  Stay tuned for another edition of When the Mics Are Off.  Or on.  Yeah, on.  Because we recorded it.  When the Mics Are Off.  It's got potential. 
[03:40:00]  It certainly does.  It definitely has potential.  Unfortunately, we're just horrible dullards in real life.  Right.  That's all you get.  I was trying to listen to the FU line in the background, because it was a new one.  So I wanted to hear how it sounded.  If I would have turned that down.  Who knows, though?  Because I didn't know you guys were recording that.  Because, you know, it's supposed to be When the Mics Are Off.  When the Mics Are Off On.  Someone is suggesting that we do the whole show with the mics off.  Ah.  What are they getting at with that?  Wow.  I don't like that implication. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, it'd suck.  Oh, was that Jimmy, or was that...  I didn't like the implication.  Was it Jimmy turning...  It sounds like he's slowly turning into old creepy guy Paul.  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  His name's Uncle Paul.  He's not a real uncle.  He's a friend of the family uncle.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  Not blood.  No.  Well, a little at first.  It's natural.  Everybody bleeds the first couple of times.  Don't let that upset you. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, my God.  It's okay.  Oh.  This is the voice that a therapist gets out of him on a couch after they hypnotize you.  What the fuck did he...  What?  That was Uncle Paul.  He's trying to comfort someone.  As he sings in their ear.  Happy fourth birthday to you. 
[03:41:30]  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul's a ghoul.  You know how old he is?  You know how old he is?  58.  Yeah.  No.  57.  57 years young.  Years young.  Oh, what a creep.  Is he married?  My wife was killed in a fire.  I got an insurance settlement.  Settlement.  Settlement. 
[03:42:00]  She was burned over 92% of her body.  I took care of her seven years.  Never stopped making love.  DJ and a light bulb from Post Wars.  Wow.  And off the air speaking to a black man.  Yeah, I know.  That's the most surprising thing ever. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  Oh, Steve, could you throw this online?  Everyone's requesting it.  The Kramer rap.  Yeah.  That's really good.  Is that one of our fans that did that?  I thought so, too.  But no, unfortunately not.  I mean, our fans have come up with some great stuff.  Who's that?  We found it off the internet.  It's online.  Is it a YouTube video?  No?  That was actually done a year ago, too.  Let's go to Dom in New York.  Dom, what's up?  What up?  What up?  Hello, kid.  Hey, buddy. 
[03:43:00]  Hey.  Yeah.  What up?  What's up?  How you doing, man?  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  You called us.  Dom?  Dominic.  Hey, Dom.  Dominic, what's up?  What's going on, brother?  This is from Rochester, New York.  I wanted to say thank.  Because ever since I heard you guys on 94.1 The Zone, I made my way to go out and buy  me an XM.  Now I don't listen to the fucking radio no more.  Oh, great.  And another thing, Howard Stern's a fucking douchebag.  And Jimmy, Jimmy, I thought you were a lot bigger than when I seen you on David Letterman.  Yeah, I'm a little fella, sir. 
[03:43:30]  People think I'm big, but I'm really small.  The way you talk, you tell me I'm a fat bastard, you know, so I think it's kind of  funny.  Thanks, man.  All right.  But no, you know what?  Do people think that I'm very, very tall, but I'm actually not?  One character a day, Jimmy.  Hey, that shit happened in New York?  You're going to blow your wand.  Huh?  That shooting that happened in New York? 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Well, it was well deserved.  Fuck it.  What are you going to do?  All right, Dominic.  Thank you.  Hey, God.  All right, brother.  Hey, you know, I appreciate Dominic's phone call.  I really do.  But you might want to support the radio stations a little bit.  Absolutely.  Support the advertisers.  Support the radio stations.  Support what the radio stations are doing.  They've been very good to us.  Like the West Palm Beach station is throwing a refined concert called The Bake Sale.  You support that.  You support that.  You support the station.  You support the advertisers.  Yeah, because a lot of, you know, we understand a lot of people hear us on radio and then want 
[03:44:30]  to listen to XM.  Yeah.  And get the XM.  That's fine and dandy.  Yes.  Yes.  But just support the local radio stations that we're on.  That's right.  All right.  We have time to take a break then, dude.  Line of the day.  Do you know what the most common misconception about me is?  Um, that you were not voted sweetest boy?  Oh, I was.  Oh.  I always voted sweetest boy in town.  In town. 
[03:45:00]  Five years in a row.  Wow.  That's my size.  Must have been sick of you.  No, no, no.  After five years.  People think I'm much smaller than people think.  Really?  Tiny.  You're teeny.  You're pocket size.  People always think that I'm going to be such a tall person.  But then they see me and I'm like a little, little appution. 
[03:45:30]  I need to get more than two and a half hours of sleep or this is what the listeners get.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Hey, let's go to Jeff in Cleveland.  Jeff.  Hey, you know, I want some Uncle Paul ringtones and you've got to put that character in a rockstar game, man.  That character is so rock.  All right.  You get some ringtones.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul ringtones.  Yeah.  Ringy, dingy, dingy, pick up the phone, little girl. 
[03:46:00]  Pick up the phone, little boy.  Pull down your underpants and pick up the telephone.  Work on it.  Holy crap, Jenny.  It's really good.  And creepy.  It's too creepy.  Before we do line of the day, we'll stay here.  Fuck the break.  Whoa.  Wow.  Hey.  We do things on the fly here.  Uh, President Clinton talking to the AIDS puppet today.  Oh.  There's a, there's a, there's a HIV puppet, right? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  I guess so.  We've talked about it in the past.  Because he was, uh, on, uh, some news show and all we saw was the, um, video.  Didn't hear the audio.  Right.  But it was the, yeah.  President Clinton talking with an AIDS muppet.  And the muppets think it got AIDS from somebody's hand.  Huh?  Yeah.  Bob Diaz, of course.  Oh.  Hey.  The feedback coming in like crazy.  Uncle Paul freaks me the fuck out.  That's from, uh, someone's cell phone.  Watch your language.  Here's Clinton with the, uh, the AIDS muppet. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  HIV muppet.  Yeah.  AIDS muppet.  Well.  War.  Mr. President, I have a very important question for you.  What does a former Mr. President do?  Well, Cammie, one of the things I do is talk to people about things that are important to  them, about things that will make a difference in their lives.  Oh, yes.  Well, I do that also.  I like to talk to people about my school and my friends and my favorite things. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, and I also talk to them about HIV and AIDS.  Me too, Cammie.  Anyway, talking and listening and helping people learn about HIV and AIDS.  Excuse me.  Can we, for one second, please?  Yeah.  How does dumb Kimmy fucking add AIDS as an afterthought?  Yeah.  Well, I like football.  Oh, by the way, I have AIDS.  AIDS.  How is that number eight on the priority list to talk about?  Uh, school.  Uh, snacks.  You would blow off sports, I believe. 
[03:48:00]  Of course you would.  No one would want to play with you.  Don't tackle her.  You'd score every time you touch the ball.  They'd just throw it to you.  Go.  My son had 12, uh, touchdowns.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, Jimmy.  That is a bad one.  I didn't think it would be bad.  Oh, it is really bad.  Uncle Paul voice.  That's Uncle Paul.  He's got a little intimidated.  Uncle Paul really stinks.  Yeah, Uncle Paul has colon cancer.  Smelling Uncle Paul's colostomy bag.  Oh, my God. 
[03:48:30]  It is so bad, I'm going to vomit.  Yeah, he's just got a tumor in his colon.  Oh, my headphones have fallen off.  Wow.  Jimmy, you're cracking me up today, man.  That is like sulfur gas.  So, I've got a bad diet.  Yeah, what's wrong, Uncle Paul?  I eat a lot of potato chips.  Why potato chips?  Kids like potato chips.  Yeah.  Yeah, bounce a little on my knee.  Give me some potato chips. 
[03:49:00]  Kissing it back in the neck.  Aw.  Good to see you.  All right, we're good.  Yeah, we're good.  Wouldn't it be funny if Clinton said, well, you can't get aged because you're a Muppet.  You're not a faggot.  Oh, yeah.  What are we doing?  Yeah.  Bill, yes, yes.  That's what I'm saying.  Yes, Bill, yes.  Yes.  Oh, you need a cough. 
[03:49:30]  Sorry.  Just a secret message.  What?  Just a secret message.  There's no secret messages here.  Have to do secret message.  Have to.  Have to.  Is he putting something together?  Have to.  Have to.  Is he putting something together?  Secret message.  And needed a cough?  Well, once you read for yourself.  I don't have IF, as I call it, up over here.  Yeah.  Instant feedback.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's about the...  Ah!  Just cough a lot. 
[03:50:00]  All right.  Back to Clinton.  It's what you think it is, Ant.  Okay.  The, uh...  You got it?  What's his name?  Bill.  Mm-hmm.  And Frank.  Go down.  Go down.  Go down.  Go down.  Go more down. 
[03:50:30]  More down.  Uh-huh.  No, Bill!  No!  Now Bill's being an ass.  Is Bill stupid?  No, Bill!  No, Bill's very smart.  But now he's fucking with us.  No, Bill.  Yes.  All right.  We got to move on.  Why?  Why are you ringing a bell?  I'm ringing a bill.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Talking about HIV and AIDS are two of the things I do a lot. 
[03:51:00]  Really?  Well, I also like to talk about my feelings with my friends and family when I am feeling sad  or scared.  And I like to talk to parents about how important it is to listen to their children and how to  help to take care of each other.  Yes.  And do you tell everybody that it is okay to hug someone who is HIV positive like me?  No.  I sure do, Cammie.  Ha, ha, ha.  That makes me very happy.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:51:30]  Give me a hug.  That would have been so funny.  She went to hug her and go, don't touch me.  Give me a hug.  Yeah.  It's hugging a Muppet.  Exactly.  It's hugging a Muppet.  Why don't you have the same conversation with a kid with AIDS?  Leave a cum stain on it.  That would rule.  Yeah.  Gives him a hug and then just fucking spurts all over it.  Wipe your cock on the Muppet's neck.  Then we'll see what happens.  You hear the guy controlling it.  I think it's a, hey, hey, what are you doing over here?  Cum drips off his nose.  Oh, wait. 
[03:52:00]  I got to do another one.  Guy told me to cough if Jim has AIDS.  Oh.  I don't have AIDS.  What type of talk is that?  I just had to.  Test.  I know, but it was just a coincidence.  I just happened to have a tickly throat at the same time.  I got a tickle most of all.  A tickly throat.  A tickly throat.  Ugh.  Make a difference.  Talk to your children about HIV and AIDS. 
[03:52:30]  We're puppets.  Yeah.  Children, puppets.  Same difference.  Today's show is brought to you by the letter T.  T sound.  Anthony, not Cumia, East Brunswick, New Jersey.  The letters A, Z, and T.  All right.  Line of the day.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Kev, you got a plug?  Yeah.  You can check out my show at bigkevsgeekstuff.com.  Yeah.  You're sweet. 
[03:53:00]  Thank you, Jim.  And thanks to, wow, I almost said Will Smith.  Jesus.  Thanks to Kevin Smith for calling the program today.  We love Kevin Smith.  Clerks 2 on DVD today.  Good guy.  We'd love Will Smith too if we'd call.  Yeah.  And also an evening with Kevin Smith too, evening harder on DVD today.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Sean.  Sean, what did you learn on the show today?  Today I learned that it's actually possible to hear somebody roll their eyes.  On the radio, yeah.  Yeah.  Good boy.  Good boy.  That did happen today.  Good boy. 
[03:53:30]  All right.  You know, line of the day is sponsored by bodogfight.com.  You log on.  You watch the American fighters.  They're battling the right to represent the U.S.  in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on bodogfight.com.  It's kind of like a docu-reality thing, I think.  Is it?  Yeah.  Here's today's runner-up line of the day.  He has a tiny Vic Morrow baseball hat.  Should you be hitting Glenn Ford with a baseball bat?  Huh?  A little blackboard jungle.  1954 movie reference.  Way back.  That's very impressive. 
[03:54:00]  Daddy-O throwing a switchblade.  I wish his hat would get taken off like Vic Morrow's did.  Nothing better than a good Vic Morrow decapitation joke.  There is nothing better or on par.  Right.  I think that...  I actually thought that was gonna...  I think I was gonna top that.  No, no, no.  We're getting a request to play Rick's AIDS song as we leave today.  Can we find that?  Oh, I don't know.  That could be hurtful.  It's insensitive.  Are you guys ready for today's line of the day? 
[03:54:30]  Of course.  There's no faggity song before it.  Here.  Come on.  Oh.  Here.  Come on.  Here.  What, line of the day?  Line of the day.  What?  I didn't hear you today.  Oh, line of the day.  She brought a peewee?  La, la, la, la, la.  You're a...  La, la, la.  La, la, la. 
[03:55:00]  You're a...  You're a...  La, la, la.  La, la, la.  You're a loud mouth.  Yeah, we get it.  We get it.  You call this little man.  Right.  Good morning, Mrs.  I pity the poor fool have to live with a...  Like you.  Oh.  Ah.  It's an eight.  Line of the day.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:55:30]  I thought there were better ones.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't think I deserved line of the day today.  I was happy with my runner-up position with Vic Morrow's head.  But, um...  I'll listen to the replay.  I'll point it out.  I'll email you.  All right.  Sorry.  Teasing, of course, like I could give a flying fuck.  Flying fuck.  Interesting.  Who are these people that fly and fuck?  How are you supposed to eat your peanuts when you're flying and fucking? 
[03:56:00]  Come on.  Let's go meet.  Yeah, we got meetings.  Ew, you got to go back to Free FM to meet him?  No.  Right here, my friend.  Oh, who's calling now?  That was good when that went off when we were having dinner with the Hollanders.  I had half in there, too.  It takes balls to have a ringtone like this, by the way.  It really does.  It takes porn to admit that.  Did I say it takes porn to admit that? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, what an unfunny nothing.  The boards are right.  I really can't answer that right now.  The boards are right.  What?  What's in the grudge?  What are you doing?  Are you coming to New Year's Eve, by the way?  You didn't say yes.  Um, Borgata.  Yeah, I'm performing.  I almost sold out, so I'm not worried about taking a break. 
[03:57:00]  New Year's Eve.  Are you coming?  I was scared about that guy down there killing hookers, and I wanted to stay away.  I don't think you've got to worry about that.  You're scared.  Who am I supposed to celebrate with?  He's fucking removing all my options.  Wow.  Kev is falling asleep right there.  That's nice.  You just, like, your eyes rolled, and you just passed out right there.  Oh, what's that?  A ring?  That means he has a message.  I have a message.  I was hoping you'd come.  I got, uh, my girlfriend will be there.  Anthony will be there.  His girlfriend will be there.  Yes. 
[03:57:30]  And I was hoping you'd come as well.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think?  All right.  There's a bald chick on television with the orange jumpsuit.  She looks like a Russian spy.  She ate some sushi in England.  We said the same thing, but you said it's funnier. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, no.  Now you did.  No.  I went with the obvious.  I said, you know, why don't you say, cancer head, cancer head?  Fucking no couth whatsoever.  Bald cancer fallout hair.  Fucking obvious asshole I am.  Oh, we're going to end with Rick's age song.  Yeah.  Oh.  What happened?  You got it?  What?  Oh, fucking Eric giving you some lip.  Way to go, kid.  Where is it?  A little hat.  Do you have a slingshot in your back pocket? 
[03:58:30]  The magnifying glass.  Yeah.  Probably wants to get home and read the latest Encyclopedia Brown novel.  Highlights.  Highlights.  Are you goofus or gallant?  Do you rush home and check the mailbox for your x-ray specs you sent away for?  By the way, dog shit sniffer again from Woodside.  He's been on fire today.  Kev, don't fall asleep with Uncle Paulie in the room.  Might touch ya.  Yeah, Kev's a big boy. 
[03:59:00]  I like a big boy.  More up in a hug.  People are confused.  They're thinking they're hearing when the mics are off right now.  Well.  No.  No.  No.  This is when the hosts are tired.  Yeah.  It's called when the hosts hit the brick wall.  Yeah.  11 o'clock.  Boy, what a coincidence.  Oh, 11 on the nose.  We don't work late.  On the nose.  Let's get out of here. 
[03:59:30]  We're all gay.  Stick and see.  N-R-A.  T-cell's low.  We got the HIV.  It's a great way to lose some weight.  On our way to Christopher Street.  Dead in days.  Legion's all over my face.  Pound my eggs and grab some A-Z-D. 
[04:00:00]  You can watch my life wither away.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby.  Hockey.  Bubby.  Shoot.  Shoot.  Shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to all the millions.  You hear me?  Shoot.  Shoot.
