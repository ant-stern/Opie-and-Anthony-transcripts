<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with darkly humorous speculation about Hurricane Rita's potential impact on New Orleans, following Katrina.  Callers and hosts made morbid jokes about the city's repeated flooding and the suffering of its residents, and discussed potential casting for a Hurricane Rita movie, suggesting actors like Sandra Bullock and Morgan Freeman. This transitioned into a comedic, highly offensive critique of Little Rock, Arkansas tourism commercials, with callers and hosts mocking the city's attractions.  Numerous listener calls contributed to both segments, featuring offensive and sexually explicit comments and jokes.  A pre-recorded, extremely profane and aggressive movie trailer created by Laszlo for the show was played, along with segments from the "F-U Line," featuring angry and obscene messages.  Guests present in the studio during this portion included Laszlo and Julia from *Coed Magazine* (scheduled to discuss sex), with a later scheduled call from Gene Simmons.

The show then moved to an album sales trivia game. Opie and Anthony attempted to guess which album outsold a list including *Nevermind*, *1984*, *The Joshua Tree*, *Abbey Road*, *Ten*, *Purple Rain*, *The Black Album*, *Born in the USA*, *Appetite for Destruction*, and *Physical Graffiti*.  Their guesses were interspersed with crude banter and insults directed at Bruce Springsteen and other artists. They briefly discussed sign language, a Brian Wilson character from the *Imus in the Morning* show, and the merits of Long Island versus New Jersey musicians. The correct answer was revealed to be Hootie and the Blowfish's *Cracked Rear View*.  The conversation shifted to morbid airline facts about transporting dead bodies and the Coca-Cola formula's secrecy.  A caller challenged the album list, noting the omission of *Dark Side of the Moon*.  The hosts discussed Bill Burr's HBO special and a *Blender* Magazine list of "500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born," leading to further debate and humorous riffing. A clip of Diddy poorly teaching Martha Stewart to rap was played.  No guests besides Opie and Anthony were explicitly mentioned in-studio during this segment.

A segment on hip-hop slang followed, featuring a teaching session with a female participant attempting to rap.  Bill Burr, in studio, discussed his HBO special, mentioning a female-imitating voice that negatively affected his female audience.  The hosts and guests explored the meanings of slang terms ("Benjamins," "on the low," etc.), often leading to humorous misunderstandings and crude jokes.  A song, "Psycho Stick Beer," was played, and its origins were debated between show staffers Steve and Eric (E-Rock).  A "New York Black Street Slang Exam" tested the female participant's knowledge. Listener calls interjected, with some questioning the number one song on "Squizzle" and slang definitions. Laszlo, a sound designer for Grand Theft Auto, was a guest, promoting his work and discussing controversies surrounding the game. He played his vulgar movie trailer parody for the show and recounted an anecdote about receiving calls from someone claiming to be with the FCC. E-Rock joined, discussing the Opie and Anthony auction and his experiences at K-Rock.  Audio clips of a near-miss pronunciation of "jack off" and a gamer's tantrum were played. The segment concluded with discussion of content on Steve's website, Foundry Music, including listener-submitted videos and Laszlo's movie trailer.  Finally, audio from Laszlo’s show with Big Wayne was played detailing graphic sexual encounters and an abortion.

A further segment covered listener emails criticizing Anthony's appearance, the creation of a radio serial, "Jaguar Skills" (a 1970s action-adventure show with a DJ ninja protagonist), and a call from Julia from *Co-Ed Magazine*. Guests included Laszlo, Bill Burr, and Julia.  A significant portion focused on Julia's experiences as a dating columnist, including her thoughts on the walk of shame, dating experiences (including a relationship with a Congressman), and advice on dating dynamics.  Her responses to the hosts' crude and sexually explicit questions were a central feature.  A tangential conversation about a contest winner, Hawk ($100,000), and how he might spend it, was included. Gene Simmons' absence was briefly mentioned.  The hosts' banter was characterized by crude humor and sexual innuendo.  The "Jaguar Skills" audio clip featured exaggerated violence and sexual references.

The final segment was a phone-in dating advice segment with Julia.  Numerous sexually explicit and offensive calls from male listeners ensued. A Yellowstone caller made vulgar demands, as did Andrew from Brooklyn. Vern asked about the "friend zone," prompting discussion of confidence and "game" in dating. Subsequent calls contained graphic descriptions of sexual acts, including discussions of forced oral sex and a 55-year-old seeking relationships with 15-16-year-olds.  The hosts and Julia reacted with shock, humor, and attempts at relationship advice.  The segment ended with a reflection on the contrast between men's on-air and dating behavior, mentioning a *Friends* writer's lawsuit.  The absence of Gene Simmons and Brad from the Islanders was mentioned. Julia provided her website and magazine information.  The hosts' interactions were laced with sexually suggestive comments and vulgar language.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Do you ever suck a guy's cock? 
[00:05:30]  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you, who were you tonight?  The kick-ass pose?  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:06:00]  I know a thing.  I can't go with a thing or two about a thing or two.  That's right.  That's right.  Hi.  I'm just checking Fox News.  I've got to keep track of Rita.  Lovely Rita.  Now they're saying Houston, huh?  They have it plotted through, like, next month.  Yeah, they won't know exactly where this thing's going once it gets into the Gulf.  To tell you the truth.  They just don't know.  It's just so funny.  They're showing the hurricane and what it could possibly do. 
[00:06:30]  And so far, the projections are that it's going to hit to the left of Houston.  But you know they're all in the newsrooms just praying.  Praying that it's going to move a little further east.  Who doesn't want this to hit New Orleans?  Just as a viewer.  Taking the human tragedy out of the mix.  You know, I understand people will be killed and it will be a horrible thing.  But as like a movie, who doesn't want to see it hit New Orleans again?  See what a one-two punch will do to that city. 
[00:07:00]  Of course you want to see that.  Of course you want, right when they get all the water pumped out, for it to completely flood again.  Of course you do.  And the news is already hinting.  They are.  I was watching Fox News.  They just want to jump right on with that graphic.  The mayor has already stopped people from coming back.  He said people could start returning.  We want to return to normalcy.  Everyone in the federal government is telling him, hey, slow down there, pal.  You know, there's still a lot of danger there.  I don't think people should come back.  And he's like, no, we need people to come back. 
[00:07:30]  Sees the hurricane.  Now he's like, we're going to put on hold the return of the citizen of Norland.  Norland.  God, I can't listen to that guy talk.  He is the worst.  Two hurricanes makes it a comedy.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  Two negative.  Now it's funny.  Yeah, now it's funny.  First time.  Oh, my God.  The levee broke.  The second time.  Dude, they just put it back.  That same fucking guy who was going to live. 
[00:08:00]  Now look at him.  You dumb jackass.  You should have stayed in Houston.  This Negan guy, the mayor, he's telling everyone, you know, to stay away like you just said.  Yeah.  So they're on the outskirts.  And most likely the hurricane is going to hit on the outskirts.  Yeah, it's not going to, odds are it's not going to hit directly where they were in New Orleans.  It's going to go to those outlying areas where everyone evacuated to.  You know, I bet Jesus freaks down there making a fortune.  I have to be.  Because right now it literally feels like the hurricane is like stalking these people. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, chasing them.  Yeah.  If you're in the middle of that shit and all you get is a flip-flop and a t-shirt,  and some guy is just like, dude, this is it, man.  God is coming.  You need to repent.  Whatever you've got left in your pocket, you're going to do it too.  Sinner.  Sinner.  Just amazing.  Yeah.  Absolutely amazing.  Well, very busy hurricane season.  And they get him in the Gulf.  It does happen.  What are you going to do?  Poor New Orleans.  He'll still have Mardi Gras, though.  I'm certain of it. 
[00:09:00]  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, on the brighter side, if Rita misses, we have a second chance.  Yeah?  Yeah.  With?  With the storm hitting New Orleans.  Holy shit, John.  Wow.  What are you talking about?  That was record time.  We weren't on for two minutes.  You know that we're on fire already?  We have a really good start to the radio show?  And you're, like, screeching halt. 
[00:09:30]  Let's go with this.  Goodbye.  Well, what is he trying?  He...  Did he just...  Is he...  I like how vague his sentence was.  He's just like...  Yeah, that's like, you know, the other thing, too.  Like, we're going to be like...  We got another chance with the other one.  What other one?  Is there another hurricane besides Rita?  I think there's one spinning somewhere off the Bahamas.  Yeah, there were two down there.  So that's what he's saying?  If this one doesn't hit, there's another one behind Rita that might hit? 
[00:10:00]  Much of a threat.  I haven't heard of the other hurricane that might hit.  It was very vague.  Who do you think is going to star in the New Orleans made-for-TV movie?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, gee.  Maybe a little Liv Tyler.  Screaming on top of...  She'll be like a deputy sheriff.  Yeah, she...  Horrendous New Orleans accent.  She would have to be somebody, yeah, like a cop or something like that.  Not a victim.  It would be Sandra Bullock.  You think Sandra Bullock?  Yeah.  They'd have to bring every black actor in, though. 
[00:10:30]  Every black actor would have to be brought in.  Morgan Freeman playing the same role again.  Frank Amos playing a diabetic.  I need my insulin.  Is he too...  Morgan Freeman too old to be the mayor, though?  Or could he play the mayor?  They could just...  Why not?  Morgan Freeman can do anything.  Yeah, he can do anything, of course.  Actually, they'll have Will Smith as the mayor.  Will Smith?  No, Will Smith's got to be like one of the guys that helps the shit.  Shitload of people.  Well, it's going to be an action movie. 
[00:11:00]  Out of the roof.  Out of the roofs.  We've got WB-11 here in New York already teasing that the hurricane might hit New Orleans.  Even though...  Already.  Even though all the real people are saying that it's looking like Galveston.  And they have no clue, these things.  You've got to wait.  You've got to wait.  Yeah, you've got to wait.  For the second time in a month, New Orleans residents are fleeing for higher ground.  Another storm could be headed this way.  And people have been told to get out by tomorrow.  Yeah, it's like you're fighting a losing battle, but this is all means.  We're not going to quit. 
[00:11:30]  We're going to build this back.  Business owners began returning over the weekend.  The Algiers neighborhood across the river from the French Quarter just reopened Monday.  Now the plan to bring nearly 180,000 back is on hold.  We are suspending all re-entry into the city of New Orleans.  Criticized for reopening the city too soon, Mayor Ray Nagin is now bracing his city for round two with Mother Nature.  Our levee systems are still in a very weak condition.  Our pumping stations are not at full capacity. 
[00:12:00]  We're on a mop.  Any type of storm that heads this way and hits us will put the east bank of Orleans Parish in very significant harm's way.  Nagin says a mere three-foot storm surge could cause another breach in the levees.  President Bush, who is headed back to the region today, had questioned the plan to return evacuees to New Orleans.  If it were to rain a lot, there is concern from the Army Corps of Engineers that the levees might break.  And so, therefore, we're cautious about encouraging people to return at this moment of history. 
[00:12:30]  Of history?  The president is making two stops.  Later this morning, he will be in Gulfport, Mississippi.  This afternoon, he will be here in New Orleans where he will get a briefing on Rita and meet with businesses recovering from Katrina.  Live in New Orleans, Sabrina Fang for the WB-11 Morning News.  John, back to you.  Sabrina, thanks.  I'm going to go down and hug black people.  Get some photo ops.  In this moment in history, I'm going to fly over black people. 
[00:13:00]  Look down with a concerned look on my face.  I'll turn to my photographer and put a little thing on my brow.  Make me look concerned.  I'm concerned about this moment in history.  Oh, God, is he the worst.  He's going down there again today, right?  Why?  He doesn't know what the fuck to do.  He's just going to go down there again and look around.  There is nothing he needs to go down there for.  There are people you delegate responsibility to in these situations. 
[00:13:30]  You make the first initial visit so you look presidential and look like you're in charge.  Then you go back and you say, you take care of this, you do that, you do that.  And, you know, there's no reason for him to fly back down there again and look around.  Oh, yeah, going down there, we'll put his hand on somebody's shoulders with that look of concern.  Look of concern.  There'll be some mother and a child and he'll pick the kid up and walk a little with the kid.  Set it back down in the water.  All right, that's a wrap. 
[00:14:00]  Let's go, people.  All right, load up the copter.  I'm leaving.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Alan.  Hey, Alan.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, what are you guys going to auction off for Hurricane 2 here?  Yeah.  I know, man.  We've got shit left.  We have nothing left.  We have nothing.  Man, you better start digging up over at Jimmy's house there.  I think he's got a few things hidden in the closet there for us.  You know, if this hurricane hits another city and destroys it, we have nothing.  We, there's just nothing we can have. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, think of that.  You have to go with, I think they deserved it.  Yeah, yeah.  I think they deserved it.  They were evil anyway.  Like, any time there's a tragedy, people always got to, like, talk up their city, like,  New Orleans is a special kind of city.  We're going to, like, really?  What would, what, Little Rock would quit?  Like, ah, yeah, we don't have it in us.  We're not like those people down in New Orleans.  Those people rebuild.  They just, they don't, they're not quitters down there.  They say, fuck it.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be hilarious if we just walked away like that? 
[00:15:00]  Hurricane 1, I'm moving out.  The city has no redeeming value whatsoever.  It's contributed nothing through the history of this country, and we're not rebuilding.  It's everything Las Vegas wants to be.  And it's commercials, you know?  Those commercials are great, though, when you turn on, it's like from the Arkansas Tourism  Bureau, and they show, like, people on a beach, riding horses, and then some historic building.  And you're thinking, what could I possibly do that's fun there?  Nothing. 
[00:15:30]  They are really trying to rope me into this one.  You're so right.  Some of these places, I could do all that in three hours.  Yeah.  And I'm supposed to go there a week?  Every building down there is historic.  They don't have any money for a new one.  And they have some stupid catchphrase, you know, something.  You'll be surprised by Little Rock.  You know, I will.  And then they show the horseback riding and the beach.  And that's pretty much it.  And I'm thinking, if I want to vacation there, all right, horseback riding.  That could be fun for an hour or two.  Like, maybe two hours. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And then you go to the beach, if it's nice out, one, maybe two days.  What are you doing for the rest of your vacation in Arkansas?  No idea.  They've shown me nothing in this commercial.  I'm sure there's a Starbucks there.  Yeah.  Some sign Bill Clinton grew up here.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what you would do.  Look at his birthplace.  Let's say hi to Mark in Oklahoma City.  Mark?  I just hope they have enough kayaks in New Orleans.  We need to fly in more kayaks.  I said kayaks.  There's another hurricane. 
[00:16:30]  These people need more kayaks.  We go in two at a time.  We take them out.  It only takes 168,000 years.  Two at a time.  Jim in Brooklyn, what's up?  Guaranteed if this hurricane hits them, they're going to have problems evacuating people.  People are going to die.  And on that note, down in Florida, I know my mother's a nurse down there, and she got  cold into the hospital last night.  They locked them down in the hospital last night.  The Florida ain't going to get much help. 
[00:17:00]  Don't worry about Florida.  All right.  Have a good one, guys.  They're going to have some flooding and a lot of rain.  This thing's going between Cuba and Florida.  Cuba and the Keys.  It's staying in the water, it looks like.  And then it goes out into the Gulf.  It's not even a hurricane yet.  It'll be a category one.  Yeah.  Let's get a pool.  I say just on the Texas-Lusiana border.  Really?  Yeah.  I say Houston.  You think Houston? 
[00:17:30]  That would really be funny, too.  Because that's where everyone went.  Houston would be good, because that's where a lot of them went, man.  I'm going to go with Corpus Christi.  This is like Corpus Christi?  Yeah.  Just because I like saying that.  This hurricane thing is like the Jaws series.  Yeah, it is.  Now the shark is following them.  Yeah.  Didn't the shark follow her down in the Bahamas or something?  Oh, it was awful in the last one.  What was that?  Jaws 8 or something?  The next one will be 3D.  Yeah, I know.  Louis Gossett, Jr.  Louis Gossett, Jr. 
[00:18:00]  Now the hurricanes have minds of their own, and they're following the people.  Yeah.  I like how they call Houston, the rappers call it, like the third coast.  If you go there, there's no sign of the ocean.  No.  When I go to the beach, you'll get in a car for like fucking two hours.  On a map, it looks like it could be close to the coast, but in reality, yeah.  You're driving hours to any beach.  You know, I didn't want to look dumb, but now that Mike is asking this on the phones,  I have to ask this as well.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, Ant, where are you finding a beach in Little Rock? 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  They show it on the commercial, my friend.  I just want to know.  Yeah, there's a beach.  I was thinking.  Probably some shitty lake or something.  I wasn't saying it was a nice beach.  I didn't say it was an ocean beach.  There were people on a beach.  When you said beach, I'm thinking ocean.  And then I'm thinking, I'm not in lake.  They go beaches every place.  They got beaches right down the hill from Mount McKinley, so no problem.  Yeah, believe me, I saw the stupid commercial.  It's those states that no one visits. 
[00:19:00]  Tennessee.  Come to Tennessee.  What am I doing in Tennessee?  They show green pastures, running horses, cows.  Some guy dressed like Davy Crockett.  Yes, the moccasin on a rock, the musket.  Yeah, this old timey dress, and some guy bending over, handing little children a piece of striped  candy, something from a restoration village.  I don't want to go.  I'm not going. 
[00:19:30]  I'm going to Vegas.  I'm going maybe if I got a weekend, I'll go to Atlantic City or Mohegan.  Sure.  I'm going to Miami.  I'm going to L.A.  There are so many places to go besides Ida, before you get down to Tennessee, before you  start getting to that area.  You're hype in a city that people leave.  Yeah, people leave.  Come to Minneapolis.  Minneapolis.  Did you guys even not?  We'll surprise you.  They always have some awful festival.  Some orange festival celebrating their history that no one knows or cares about except them. 
[00:20:00]  Anthony, Nathaniel's helping you out today.  Okay, Nathaniel.  And you know something, Than?  Thank you.  I knew Than would do something sitting there.  Free things to do in Little Rock, Arkansas.  All right.  Kill yourself.  Enjoy the art of it all.  The Arkansas Art Center.  That sounds like a thing they would do.  Arkansas.  The art of it all.  Send for your free brochure on the Arkansas Tourism Bureau.  No, I won't. 
[00:20:30]  Catch a ride or at least admire a bevy of dream machines from April through October every  Thursday of the month from 6 to 9 p.m.  More than 100 vintage, classic, and exotic cars, trucks, and motorcycles gather under the  River Market Pavilions.  For Mullet Fest 2005.  In the River Market District for the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau, popular cruising  in the rock.  Cruising in the rock.  See, they've got to make it sound cool and fun.  I want to, you know, you hear it and go, I want to go cruising in the rock. 
[00:21:00]  Enter a war zone.  Oh.  The MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History.  Wow.  You know they have a symphony.  Of course they do.  Like the Little Rock Symphony.  Little Rock Symphony.  At the Arkansas Performance for the Arts.  Do you think there's a section of Little Rock?  I got one.  Where they do Broadway shows?  Like they put on their version of Les Mis?  Of course.  Of course.  Here's a good one for you.  You go to Little Rock to see Bill Clinton's running shoes and saxophone.  Oh, my God. 
[00:21:30]  The actual one he played on the Arsenio Hall show.  Where is that?  The old state house.  Ah.  300 West Markham Street.  God, there is no reason.  Snapper shot with the Sugar Bakers?  The Sugar Bakers?  Considered a local Little Rock landmark, the circa 1881 Villa Mare, second Empire Italianate  home gained fame.  When in the 1980s, television producers and former Arkansas residents, Harry blah blah 
[00:22:00]  and wife blah blah, used the home's exterior to depict the Sugar Baker design firm on the  couple's CBS television series, Designing Women.  Are you kidding me?  Holy shit.  That reach?  They took that long to say that the stupid house used in Designing Woman is...  The exterior shot.  Right.  The establishing shot at the beginning when they go, do, do, do, do, do, at the beginning  of the show, that house is in Little Rock.  You could feed the ducks, Anthony.  Well, book me a ticket.  At the beach.  I'm going. 
[00:22:30]  At that beach I was talking about.  Visit the Peabody...  No body surfing.  Visit the Peabody ducks.  Arkansas is known as a duck hunter's paradise, but bring your camera, not your shotgun.  Oh, see?  For this free fun.  Why?  Is that their slogan?  Someone's saying their slogan is, come to Little Rock, we ain't so little after all?  Yeah.  Go window shopping, eat a peach, see the rock.  Eat a peach. 
[00:23:00]  Eating a peach is one of their selling points.  That's how bad this fucking place is to visit.  Eat.  Do something.  Sustain your life.  Breathe.  Inhale.  Exhale.  Inhale.  Exhale.  Repeat.  Eat a peach.  Well, the peach will cost you, but not much.  And a juicy, farm-fresh Arkansas peach, hand-selected at the farmer's market in the heat of summer,  is well worth the pocket change.  Isn't Georgia known for its peaches?  Yeah, but you know what?  The hand-picked peaches are so much better.  That's true.  Than some... 
[00:23:30]  Hand-picked.  Machine.  What picks a peach?  They got that tree shaker machine.  A Mexican.  A Mexican, they call it.  See the rock.  You gotta see the landmark for which the city was named.  Little Rock?  There's actually a Little Rock?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Do they have a famous sandwich that you just have to have?  It's gotta be.  This first...  What is their food?  This first outcropping of rock along the Arkansas River above its mouth was known to  pioneers and early explorers traveling the river in the early 19th century as Lapite Roche 
[00:24:00]  to distinguish it from the Big Rock upstream.  The Little Rock on the South Bank marked the transition from level lands of the east to  the rugged hills of the mountain ranges and offered a natural landing for those traveling  by boat.  We are learning more than I ever wanted to know about.  I have to admit, I actually found that a little interesting.  Was it?  Yeah.  The Little Rock.  So there's a big rock somewhere?  I guess.  You could climb a mountain. 
[00:24:30]  You could take a hike.  Book it.  Why buy the book when you could read it for free with a brand new main library in the river  market?  There's never been a better time to browse the shelves looking for a good read.  Visit a library.  That's another selling point.  Because the library is new, there's never been a better time to browse.  I bet all those books are brand spanking new and there ain't a fingerprint on them.  You want to read a fresh book, crack it open and it smells like new book, have a grave experience. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, this sounds scary.  You go to a cemetery and walk around a little bit.  Let's see, ranging from the more common angels and cherubs to a unique pair of two young  girls, two sisters who died in childhood and are buried there.  Sounds scary.  Those buried in this graveyard include at least ten Arkansas governors and three U.S. senators,  five Confederate generals, 20 Little Rock mayors. 
[00:25:30]  If you can name one, you win two days and three nights.  Exactly.  Cultivate your senses.  It just keeps going on and on.  Yeah, I would love to listen to more, but I just went to the Arkansas Symphony website.  There is indeed a symphony, Bill.  You are absolutely right.  They always do.  You know, the sad thing is I bet they're great.  None of them are from there.  You think they're really good?  It's like working up the farm teams of symphonies.  That's like quadruple A. 
[00:26:00]  You can get their performance.  Some lifer playing the fucking cello.  Steve in Philly.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, enter a war zone.  You make a wrong, turn them Little Rock and a shwoogie's Jackie before you escalate.  Yeah, I hear there's a lot of gang violence down in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Oh, absolutely.  I saw a show on that once.  All right.  Gangs of the Rock.  Hey, when are we going to have more sex on the radio?  Dude, we had a lot of sex last week.  Last week was like our sex shows.  That's right, man.  We need more sexiest state. 
[00:26:30]  Arkansas, my friend.  Yeah, do we even know who the sexiest state is at this point?  Hopefully it was me last time in December in Pennsylvania.  That was you?  Yeah.  Brought up the poop chute?  Yeah, yep, yep, yep.  All right, I remember you.  All right, let's say hi to Scott at Little Rock.  Scott?  Yeah, fellas, don't come to Little Rock.  You ain't missing a damn thing.  No?  100 degrees.  100 degrees every day, 90% humidity.  Don't waste your time. 
[00:27:00]  What do you do down there?  I travel for a living, so I'm not there very often.  Oh, so your job takes you out of Little Rock?  Yes, fortunately.  Did you grow up there?  Did you grow up in Little Rock, though?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And what did you do?  What was some of your activities for fun in Little Rock?  Fishing.  Fishing.  Yeah, we got some good fishing lakes.  That's about it.  At what age were you when you realized that that place sucked?  Damn, when I first got there.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  It's like New Orleans made over.  But the only way you would know it sucks is if you ever left there.  There's probably people that have never left Little Rock.  Think Little Rock is just the shit.  Thinking it's the Mac Daddy.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mac Daddy, my ass.  Now, boy.  All right.  That was the show.  It was Banging in Little Rock.  That was the HBO special on the gangs of Little Rock.  Who knew, right?  No one knew that before.  But weren't they a bunch of, like, Wiggers?  A bunch of little white kids trying to be in gangs or something?  Oh, maybe Anthony knows. 
[00:28:00]  Anthony!  Yo, I hope you're having me, Bill.  What's up?  Hey, man.  That Banging in Little Rock.  Was it white gangs?  No, no, no.  It was, like, strictly, like, Bugs and Crips.  That's how, like, these two gangs just pretty much dominate all the crime that's going on over there.  Yeah, I remember seeing a lot of guns and stuff.  And they were, like, beating people into the gangs.  Yeah, that was, like, one of the first HBO on the covers.  Like, one of the first cities they really, like, went into before, like, Crack Street and everything.  How weak is that, though?  Like, if any of these people went to L.A., they would just get their asses handed to them. 
[00:28:30]  But in Little Rock, they're, like, the big daddy.  Little Rock, yeah, you run the show.  Bloods and Crips, they're, like, a corporation.  Yeah.  They're, like, Burger King, McDonald's.  It's, like...  They franchise out, yeah.  All the other gangs are bummed when they come to town.  Dude, they're putting up a Walmart.  Fuck.  What about my hardware store?  Yeah, what about my mom-and-pop gang?  I just...  We were terrorizing.  We were causing mayhem.  If I had that kind of budget, I could get those kinds of weapons. 
[00:29:00]  Exactly.  Now I've got to get beaten into a gang all over again.  Fucking 32.  That was the shit, man.  I like every city, like, west of St. Louis is, like, on those HBO things.  Seems to be, like, uh...  I mean, before you get to, like, L.A. and that stuff,  there's all white kids making, like, crystal meth.  Yeah.  Stealing their dad's, like, Chevy Love pickup truck.  Chevy Love.  The rusted-out bed.  And them coming home just crying,  Why do you keep doing it?  Making crank. 
[00:29:30]  You can't even buy any...  If you notice here, even in Great Neck,  Opie Great Neck, where I live,  you cannot...  I walked into a Rite Aid.  You cannot buy cold medication.  There are signs up there that say,  these cold medications, and it's a long list,  are available behind the pharmacy counter.  You have to ask for them.  And then there's a reason.  It says, because this can be used  in the creation of methamphetamine, 
[00:30:00]  an illegal drug, blah, blah, blah.  So now, in Great Neck,  I have to get cold medication.  I have to go up to the pharmacist and ask him.  How else are you going to make your crystal meth?  How else am I going to concoct my crystal meth in my lab?  I don't know how many crystal meth labs  there are in Great Neck, to tell you the truth.  I've never seen a...  I've never seen a bus than cops  where they bust into the crystal meth lab,  and there's a mezuzah on the doorway.  I have yet to see Jewish crystal meth makers.  Ever. 
[00:30:30]  Why are you living in a Jewish neighborhood?  Because it's a wonderful place to live.  I love the Jews.  I love their lack of any crime  that they want to commit.  Perhaps white-collar crime.  I don't know what they're doing.  But as far as breaking in your doors,  as far as keying your cars,  stealing your cars,  breaking into your house, your yard,  things like that,  Jews don't do it.  They just don't do it.  I've never seen a Hasidic  walk by a car  and just key the shit out of it 
[00:31:00]  and laugh.  An Hasidic prowler?  No, there's never a Hasidic prowler.  Although they are dressed for it.  Very dark clothing.  You can probably break in  very easily undetected,  but they just don't do it.  Is there anything more uncomfortable  than seeing a Hasidic Jew  waiting for the subway  in the middle of July,  wearing that whole  little house on the prairie outfit?  You're like, too.  It's like, you know,  I believe in God  and that type of stuff,  but I don't think he minds  if you open,  like, take your coat off  or something.  Yeah, I don't think  you're going to hell 
[00:31:30]  if you just kind of  cool down a little bit.  Oh, those curly Q things  just dripping with sweat.  Curly fries?  Yeah, whatever.  Just kind of hanging there.  The payus?  Hey, you know,  I've got to go back a little bit  because the instant feedback is,  you know,  notice something  and the phone's  notice something.  How do you know  the theme song  to Designing Women?  Did I actually  do the theme song?  You did a little bit  enough where people  are like,  what the fuck?  Dude, I was just doing  random notes.  If I hit lucky,  boy, that's amazing. 
[00:32:00]  I thought that was  like a talk show,  like The View.  Yeah, see,  I was just kind of doing  an establishing shot  song type thing.  All right.  I really don't know  the theme.  Was that one of those  awful sitcoms  that you never watched  but went like 19 years?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it was close,  I guess.  I guess.  All right.  Ugh.  You're safe.  That's the soundtrack  to Suicide.  Please.  Just some awful  fucking marriage.  Honey, our show is on.  You don't have the pulse  to say you want  to watch the game. 
[00:32:30]  You just like it.  Wanna?  It is so funny.  Designing Women's on.  It's a riot.  That show  and that other one  with the old broads,  the Golden Girls.  Oh.  Oh, you know  there's another one  that was on forever?  Caroline and the City.  That whole cast  could walk by me  on the street  and I would have  no fucking clue  who they were.  And it was on forever.  Oh, they all got  huge houses.  Yeah.  And yeah,  I could not identify  one of them.  That was funny.  Oof.  I wonder what it's like  to be on a show like, 
[00:33:00]  you're making all that cash  but like nobody gives a fuck.  No one cares about it.  People and friends  are getting mobbed.  Yeah, you're not a celebrity.  You're making money,  your show's been on for years,  you walk the streets anonymously.  You go down the red carpet,  they think you're like  a publicist.  You're like,  I am starring in my own  fucking sitcom.  There you are, buddy.  Keep it moving.  Eight years.  Oh my God,  we got the cast  of Caroline and the City  on the internet here.  You're right.  Yeah, who are they?  I wouldn't recognize  any of these guys.  Who are they? 
[00:33:30]  Well, my buddy Adam Ferraro  was I think a recurring character  on two episodes.  Are we getting video of that, Ben?  Do we have video  where we can talk about that?  Yeah, we'll have video  in one second.  I want to see that clip.  Yeah, really?  Of Adam delivering  that horrible material.  I know.  Ben just wrote this down.  We need another minute  before we can say  anything on the air.  Okay.  That's wonderful.  Let's say hi to Frank in Jersey.  Frank, what's up?  That's so good.  Hey, guys.  You missed the obvious  attraction in Little Rock. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  The Bill Clinton Library.  Mm-hmm.  Where you can buy cigars  and blue dresses.  Punching out.  No.  No, you're not punching out.  Realize there's no punching out.  You are a crater  of burning jet fuel.  All right.  Let's say hi.  I always want to punch out  after the crash.  It doesn't happen that way.  I've heard people that go like,  yeah, the Clinton Library,  have you visited that? 
[00:34:30]  No.  Well, it's punching out.  Like, that's punching out.  Right.  Before he gets to the bad punchline  that is impact.  Your family will get  your dental records,  and that is the only way  they can identify you,  my friend.  That joke needed, like,  an awful late-night band  to start playing  as we went to commercial.  Hey, this is...  Hey, what's the deal with that?  It's been crazy.  Hey, Bruce.  Bruce in New York.  Hey.  Anybody else?  What's going on?  What's going on?  I heard on Fox News  or CNN this morning, 
[00:35:00]  I can't remember which,  but they say  the governor's mansion  had a fire.  Damn near burnt down  the whole trailer park.  All right.  I think we're done  with our Arkansas segment.  Jesus.  Yeah, that's a joke, son.  Don't you get it?  I made a funny, son,  and you're not laughing.  Here's Nathaniel.  Did you print that up  or somebody else?  Travis printed out  some of the bad slogans  out there.  Yeah, but they're bad slogans  for places around the world.  Like, none for the United States. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, we need the same thing  for the United States.  I see, like,  the tourism authority  of Thailand  is Thailand,  happiness on earth,  amazing Thailand,  experience variety,  Thailand.  Well, what's the slogan  for Vegas again?  Little boy?  I know.  You know what Thailand  is known for  as far as the tourism goes.  Going there,  getting and having sex  with underage,  with little children.  Yeah.  Not underage children.  What does that mean?  Having sex with underage children.  I like the children 
[00:36:00]  that are of age.  By that beach  they got there.  Thailand.  Malaysia.  It's Malaysia.  Truly Asia.  It rhymes.  You know everybody over there,  that's what they get trashed for.  Yeah.  That ain't Asia.  That ain't Asia.  Malaysia.  Truly Asia.  Incredible India.  Eternally yours.  Don't people bathe  in their own shit water  in the rivers over there?  You get a slogan?  Sounds nice. 
[00:36:30]  Well, Vegas is the good one.  Does anyone know  another slogan  for another city?  That the tourism  people said that?  I love New York.  Oh yeah, okay.  I love New York.  What does that really mean though?  Greece.  Beyond words.  Live your myth  in Greece.  Virginia is for lovers.  Oh yeah,  Virginia is for lovers.  Why?  Is that like  the license plate  or do they really...  They're even fucking  in Little Rock, so...  Wait, what's on the... 
[00:37:00]  The New Jersey license plate  is live free or die.  Is that the state's saying  or is that just...  That's not New Jersey, Ben.  New Hampshire.  That's New Jersey.  New Hampshire.  New Jersey.  New Jersey.  I meant New Hampshire.  Idiot.  Idiot.  God.  You want to see  some good video,  by the way?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Ben.  Tell everybody  what you want to do.  Poe's sound asleep  at the security desk.  Sound asleep.  Steve just videoed it.  So if you walked past  the Kevlar  and bulletproof glass window,  you could see  Poe sleeping in there. 
[00:37:30]  Thank God he's safe.  He's asleep on a cell phone.  He's got his hand up to his...  Thank God he is safe.  Doesn't he look like  he's getting some awful news?  That's just...  Can you hear him  snoring in that video too, Steve?  Oh, that's all.  He's in the soundproof area.  His head is down.  He is completely...  Not even trying  to look like he's awake  or hidden or anything.  That's great.  Someone get him on a phone.  I don't want him in studio.  He's dreaming  he's squared off  with Bruce Lee. 
[00:38:00]  Whoa!  You got like a fake gun?  Somebody put like  a ski mask on  and just freak him out.  Walk up to him  and put it to his head.  You'd probably end up dead though.  Get on the ground, motherfucker!  You'd probably end up dead.  He'd twist your arm off.  Kind of disheartening  when you're trying  to do a morning show  and make people laugh  and entertain them  and your security guy  is fast asleep.  He really would.  Wake up and smother you  with that leather vest.  That he wears  every fucking day.  All right, let's...  Where's...  Andalusia.  Andalusia?  Andalusia. 
[00:38:30]  There's only one.  I didn't even know  there was one.  Iceland.  Unspoiled Iceland.  I want ones  from states though.  Yeah, that would be fun.  Like, how do they...  How are they talking up  like Oklahoma?  How are they talking up  South Dakota?  I've been to South Dakota though.  They've got  the Badlands there.  That's nice.  They've got Mount Rushmore.  They've got a lot  of pretty rocks.  Rocks are there.  Lots and lots of rocks. 
[00:39:00]  All right,  we're going to take  our first break  and we'll continue  with the Opie and Anthony program.  We've got lots to do today.  We've got Laszlo coming in.  Oh, you want to hear  the Laszlo trailer?  Yes.  We should play this right away.  Laszlo coming in studio  at 9 a.m.  He does some great production  for the Opie and Anthony show.  Also, Julia from Coed Magazine  in studio to talk about sex.  Gene Simmons calling in  later on.  That'll be fun.  Well, he's promoting  his school of rock  or whatever.  He's got another...  He's got something else too. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that school thing  still on?  Does he have like a kiss laptop?  He's got so much stuff  going on.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  Just remember when you  were surprised to learn  he was Jewish?  Remember that?  Like years ago,  no, the guys from Kiss,  get out of here.  Gene Simmons doing...  Now it's just like...  Of course he is.  He's always hawking his wares.  Do you guys remember  at NAW when he came up  to the studio  and he's like showing you  the Kiss Visa?  He's like,  you guys got to get these.  He's showing them  with everyone.  Yes, the Kiss Visa.  You guys need this.  It's wonderful.  My interest rate is only 15%. 
[00:40:00]  He's got Kiss like...  The Kiss coffin  was the big thing.  Remember that?  Didn't Dimebag Daryl  get buried in a Kiss coffin?  Yes, he did.  Oh, God.  We got Master Poe in line?  Master Poe.  Yeah, how you doing?  Are we disturbing  your sleep today?  No, I'm doing just fine.  They got video of you sleeping.  Oh.  Yeah.  You have a long night?  No, no.  Not at all. 
[00:40:30]  I kicked the Sandman's ass,  gentlemen.  Tried to sprinkle sand  in my eyes.  I choked him out.  Choked him into submission.  I was choking sheep all night.  What happened there, Poe?  Were you sleepy?  No, I just had my breakfast.  I'm fine.  But you fell asleep,  so you're probably  a little sleepy  from something last night.  Yeah, we don't have video  of you eating an egg sandwich.  We have video of you  snoring and sleeping.  We're not getting out  of this one.  Okay.  Why do you feel like  you're the only one  that can't be part  of this radio show?  We caught you sleeping, 
[00:41:00]  so now you have  to tell us something.  Were you meditating?  You know something?  I was.  Does that look like  what he does?  He meditates?  Remember Mr. Miyagi,  Karate Kid?  He was meditating,  and Daniel's son  walked in,  and he thought  he was sleeping.  Yeah, I was meditating.  He didn't budge,  he didn't move,  looked to sleep.  That's right.  He was meditating.  You were meditating.  Prank for the victims.  Yeah, if you want  to call him meditating,  sure, I was meditating.  Yeah.  No, tell us.  My mouth was open,  meditating?  I've never seen people  snore meditating.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  What happened?  You didn't get a lot  of sleep last night?  No, I'm fine.  I was just doing,  I was just cleaning up  my place,  and, you know,  extra work,  that's all right.  Yeah?  That's a little sleepy  this morning?  Just a little.  I'll be fine.  All right.  All right, Poe.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  There he goes.  He was just meditating.  He's not happy.  No.  He wants people  to think he's perfect.  No one likes  being caught sleeping.  And that he never, ever, 
[00:42:00]  ever fucks up.  Duck that chink  a day's paper  napping on the job.  I just saw that  the other night again.  No one likes  to be caught sleeping  on the job.  Okay, Gene Simmons  calling in a little later.  Laszlo coming in,  and he did this  production piece.  We've got to hear this.  This is great.  Yeah.  I'm going to start over  because the, uh...  Just like that.  That's it.  What happened?  I'm just babbling.  We're still on.  Why? 
[00:42:30]  I thought you were  playing something.  I was going to play  something, but it was...  We were congratulating  each other that we made  it through a break.  We go like,  well, and there it is.  Not a clue what the fuck  we were going to talk  about at a minute to seven,  and now 45 or so minutes  into the show.  We way worked.  That was like  behind the scenes.  A little pat on the back  to each other.  I took the headphones off.  I leaned back.  Let me read  some instant feedback.  That was my fault.  I thought you were  doing a bit,  but then quickly realized  that you really  were patting yourself 
[00:43:00]  on the back.  A little pat on the back.  We had shit.  We molded a fucking sculpture.  That was my fault.  More power to us.  That was my fault.  I was like,  that was easy.  That was easy.  Fucking rookie in here.  Dude, we're still on.  I'm like the fucking  weatherman out there.  And it's going to be  sunny in the 50s.  And back to you.  God, I'm fucking tired.  We're still on.  Back to basic cable.  And back to you, Bob.  Sometimes rape is good.  Hello? 
[00:43:30]  Fuck.  Normally, that's how  it would have went,  but the Laszlo production piece  was so fucking loud.  I know we blew out  some speakers,  so I wanted to start it over.  Maybe someone didn't  hear it then.  I want to turn it down  a little bit.  Were you able to hear us  babbling then?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We all heard you guys.  All right.  Here's the Laszlo production  piece again.  Suck my cock.  In 2002, darkness covered the land.  The Catholic League is praising  Infinity Broadcasting for canceling 
[00:44:00]  the Opie and Anthony show.  And evil reigned supreme.  Who?  Robin?  Until one day, they returned  and all hell broke loose.  Bullshit!  Can you hear me?  I'm Jim Norton,  and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  One Wednesday,  I picked up a guy in a dress  and he sucked my dick.  You just sit back and watch  what happens next.  Opie.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Anthony.  Away with you. 
[00:44:30]  Away.  Away.  Leave.  Leave the fucking studio.  Jim Norton.  Every one of you  is a time-wasting cockpeak.  I will beat children  about the head.  And the O&A Army.  Our fans are a bunch  of jackasses.  Three men leading an army  from the pits of darkness.  You are shit.  You are worthless.  We're all losing.  I could give a fuck.  Fighting the evil nemesis  poisoning the land. 
[00:45:00]  Tell him, friend.  You're a fucking,  you're just a little scumbag,  you know, I'd just spit  in your fucking face.  I'd love to spit  in your fucking face.  Fuck him.  And a battle  that almost separated them forever.  I'm an actor.  You're insane.  You know how a show works  and then you have  these stupid opinions.  I understand you  trying to do a radio show.  We're not gonna do that,  you ass.  Aw, don't get all angry  and yell.  Jim, you're fucking  pissing me off.  Whatever.  Holy shit.  What happens  when love  pushes you  over the edge? 
[00:45:30]  I gotta feel the tits.  Nowhere to run.  Who is this idiot  on the radio?  Nowhere to hide.  You're shit out of luck.  And no way out.  Dance, motherfucker, dance.  Yeah, look at my cock.  The most anticipated  thriller of the year.  Give to me the money  I will make for you  the like I fuck.  Ah, no!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rated R for retarded.  The very worst 
[00:46:00]  of the Opie and Anthony  F-U-Line.  Yeah, how about a big  fuck you to Harry,  the intern  for Ron and Fez.  Harry,  you better get your ass  wired to your head  or I will take a big  shit on you.  All right.  Fuck you, Harry.  Yeah, it's Dan.  Hi, Harry.  I just wanted to remind you.  Fuck you, Harry.  My fucking foot, man!  Something fell on my fucking foot, man!  Pussy.  Fuck you, Harry. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, come on!  Fuck, you can't give me  one minute of airtime?  Fuck, you won't even  fucking answer the call now?  F-U, Harry.  I want to give a big  fuck you to the town  for making my job  a living hell  every goddamn day.  I want to give a big  fuck you to the  gas station manager  who thinks she's hot shit  because she told me  I couldn't give a credit card  over the phone.  I want to say  fuck you,  fuck you,  fuck you,  fuck you!  Fuck you,  you're a fucking  fucking  butthole of America  in North Carolina!  Fuck you! 
[00:47:00]  You are a fucking  tool, Harry!  Fuck you!  This is Noah Mike.  I want to give out  a big fuck you  to my brother, Andrew.  I'm homeless now  because of this damn  hurricane here in New Orleans.  This douchebag's got  two apartments,  one that no one's in.  So what does he do?  He offers it to me?  Then what do you do?  Because that whole  of your marriage  who controls you  and has your balls  in a jar,  you end up giving it  to his,  her mother's  friend of a friend 
[00:47:30]  instead of your brother,  your own family  who's homeless.  Fuck you, Andrew,  and fuck your wife.  Hey, Alex,  how's about we  go steal some  picnic basket?  Oh, I don't know, Steve.  I don't think  the park ranger  will like that.  Oh, if the ranger  doesn't see,  the ranger won't know.  Hey!  Fuck all y'all!  Call the O.P.  at Anthony F.U.  line at 1-866-FU  line at 1-866-FU 
[00:48:00]  line at 1-866-FU  line at 1-866-FU  Oh, fuck you very much.  Let's hear that we play.  That's how we speak  of rock out  sodomy.  We're back  with the O.P.  and Anthony program.  We like to call this  the O.A. virus  and it's spreading  slowly but surely  across America.  We just came up  with a pretty good idea,  Yeah, but Steve is very bummed out about our brilliant new idea. 
[00:48:30]  More work for poor Steve.  Well, we just played the Laszlo O&A movie trailer, and it was really, really good.  We'll be playing that from time to time.  Oh, whoa!  Watch it, Steve!  Steve is making a joke.  Oh, Jesus!  Oh, there he goes.  Come on now.  So, you're getting a little ballsy with that thing.  You came right over my head.  I wasn't expecting Bill to be here.  I was looking for a spot.  Yeah, Jesus Christ. 
[00:49:00]  Sorry.  That's really stupid, though.  Dane, you know Bill's going to be here every day.  Well, you're right.  You're right.  I just...  Oh!  Hydrogen exhaust is so tiring.  You can't let that slide.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I'm working on three hours of sleep.  All right, so...  Hybrid improv skills.  Yeah.  So, Laszlo did a great O&A movie trailer.  So, I turned to Anthony.  I'm like, you know, the listeners like to get involved from time to time.  Remember when we did jingles? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Oh, where are the jingles?  Hold on.  They're all in...  Oh, those jingles.  Yeah, hold on.  I got two of our favorite jingles that came in.  Oh, you're playing the Obey!  That one's great.  Well, I liked it.  All right, yeah.  That's my favorite.  Yeah, this one's my favorite.  Obey!  Anthony!  And Norton, too!  Good times!  Great hits!  XF-202!  Suck my fucking cock! 
[00:50:00]  Oh!  Well, look who's just locked in!  It's E-Rock!  Fuck, dude.  We're in the middle of doing something.  Sorry, I was showing Nathaniel something.  What were you showing Nathaniel?  Roll the listener, James.  His new album.  Yeah, if you weren't listening yesterday, Eric has walk-on music now.  Yeah!  From one of his favorite artists.  Where all the rest of the listener jingles are.  We don't need the rest of the listener jingles.  We only need the ones we have. 
[00:50:30]  All right, there he goes.  Thank you, Eric.  It kind of saunters out when that music starts playing.  Doesn't he sachets?  All right, here's a look of humiliation on his face.  Oh!  Is he the only one that has walk-on music?  Steve has the hybrid thing every time he comes in.  We used to have Martini Steve music every time he came in.  God, that is the worst music.  Do we still have that?  Yeah.  It's on your replay, I think.  Is it? 
[00:51:00]  All right, hold on.  Danny, do you know where it is?  I think it's over here.  I actually think I know where it is.  In the old days when Steve was drinking like a maniac.  Oh, well.  No, that's the remix.  We used to just play the music from Austin Powers.  All right, here's the other jingle that came in from one of the listeners.  That one is so creepy that I love it. 
[00:51:30]  I can't hear what he's saying.  Of course you can't.  He's going, Greg, and Tony show Greg, and Tony show Greg, and Tony's got Dr. Norton with  Sex Advice, wear no bag, spread the hiv, it's on XM.  Jesus Christ.  For now, listen, I'll play it again, you'll hear it all.  Now, isn't it so obvious? 
[00:52:00]  That is so creepy.  He just picks her in his basement carving women up.  Yeah.  You know, with that creepy voice.  Yeah, you're tied up like that.  And he's sitting there going, and he's sitting there going, and it's a big ball gag in their  mouth, and they're just, it's so horrific that he's having such a good time singing and  carving them up.  You're just waiting for the horror to begin. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, is that awful?  Oh, my God.  Very funny.  So the point I was going to make really fast, and it's taking about 10 minutes, Laszlo,  ONA movie trailer.  Well, the listeners did the jingles down the road.  That was months ago.  Yeah.  I'm thinking maybe listeners could come up with Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  Take it upon themselves to use their own computers or studios or whatever they do, and concoct 
[00:53:00]  a movie trailer.  Yeah.  Based on the Opie and Anthony trailer.  Why not?  And use the voice guy.  So, you know, that's how these ideas start.  It's just Anthony and I shooting the shit, but Steve, unfortunately, was listening in,  and all he was saying was, oh, dear God, no.  Oh, God.  Because they all get sent to Steve.  Dial tone.  All right.  That was a little weird, huh?  What was that?  Stop it. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, because they...  Get down.  All the production for the show is sent to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, Steve at foundrymusic.com.  So, you make these things up, and Steve will sift through acres and acres of diarrhea.  Like Nolens.  Yeah.  He will seek out some type of little nugget of gold.  A little morsel.  Yeah.  You'll love creativity, but it's just some people really want to pat themselves on a back,  on the back for...  On the back, yeah, right back down. 
[00:54:00]  On a mush.  Right back down, man, for the flow shit.  He really gets all flustered.  He is so flustered right now.  He's adjusted the arms of the chair.  Or...  Okay, that's going to be a good level.  I found my little chi.  Yeah.  This is going to flow.  What's the matter, Steve?  You're a little nervous.  No, no.  I'm really sleep-deprived after last night, because I didn't get home until midnight.  Oh, you went to Bon Jovi?  Bon Jovi.  Oh, how was that?  Actually, it was very good.  It was...  To see a band like that in such a small venue, like that Nokia Theater, which is really one 
[00:54:30]  of the coolest, coolest venues I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  You caught all the nuances of Shot Through the Heart?  I certainly did.  You know, it's...  Living on a Prayer.  I don't know if they did that one.  Come on!  They had it.  Whoa, we're halfway there.  Whoa, whoa, living on a prayer?  Yeah, they must have.  They must have.  I was...  It's like, not for not singing my way.  Yeah, they must have done it.  They must have done it.  I mean, it was a lot of hits.  Three songs off the new album, and a field of middle-aged women.  Did they do Runaway?  No.  No Runaway. 
[00:55:00]  No old-school Runaway?  No, but they did...  What about...  Wanted!  Yes.  Dead or alive!  Yeah, they're not like that.  Richie Sambora pulled that his double-neck acoustic guitar, and they did that.  Of course they did.  Don't let me slide on that, Bill.  I love them.  So, Bon Jovi, and you said the fans, a lot of older women...  A lot of...  The middle-aged women love the Bon Jovi.  It is.  Because they were youngsters when Bon Jovi first came out.  Right.  But they're not now, and they're a lot of... 
[00:55:30]  Were they all like, you know, whoa, living...  And dancing, and screaming the music, nodding and pointing at each other.  Yeah, in the beginning of the show.  Looking at their watch, because they had to get home to the babysitter.  In the beginning of the show.  The old days are done with them.  This is my song, man.  I remember...  I lost my virginity, this song.  Absolutely did.  I mean, intermixed with all the industry people that were there, because it's a New York showcase,  it's a brand new theater, so there's a lot of, you know, suits in the place, but there's, 
[00:56:00]  you know, a thousand middle-aged housewives that are trying to recapture...  Do you get cell service in the Nokia theater?  Did you try?  Ironically, no.  My Nokia...  You can't get cell service in the Nokia theater.  You watched as a bunch of people were trying to make calls, just looking at their cell phones,  going, what the fuck?  How could the Nokia theater not have cell service?  I'm sure that's something they can fix, but we were all looking at our cell phones,  saying, why do I have no single...  Signal?  Single.  Wow.  You are a wreck. 
[00:56:30]  You are absolutely a wreck.  So tired.  People like you here, Steve.  Do they really?  Yeah, there's no reason to be like...  Yeah.  You think I'm flustered?  Yeah.  Really?  I apologize.  Yeah, you are.  Well, with each fuck-up, you get more and more flustered.  They're really just compounding.  I can't talk.  He's just too tired.  That's really good.  But he's got a cute shirt on today.  I bet you that means fuck you.  It certainly does.  In sign language.  In sign language, yes. 
[00:57:00]  I'm hoping it does.  Where did you...  You're hoping it does.  Well, it's seven letters.  One of them resembles an F.  It looks like fuck.  It looks like fuck you, so I took the guy's word for it.  And the Y-U, yeah.  Well, let's see.  Yeah, that is K.  I know K.  That looks like U on the bottom.  That is U.  That is U.  That is O.  That is...  Wait, no, that's Y.  Yeah, all right.  How do you know sign language?  I don't know.  I learned it once.  Not a lot of it, but enough of it.  That's definitely a Y-O-U.  I don't know if that's...  He knows how to say, don't scream and I won't hurt you. 
[00:57:30]  It's not like this.  Opie, when you sign the word put, do you do B-U-T?  P-U-S.  That would be odd.  All right, Steve.  That Brian Wilson character guy on Imus let out an O&A party rock at about 6.50 this morning.  He said, hi, Opie.  O&A party rock.  Hi, Anthony.  That was Overman from Whackbag.com.  Checking in.  Imus is helping us out once again today. 
[00:58:00]  We love the Imus in the Morning program.  All right.  Speaking of music, this is a quickie.  There's one album out there that has outsold the following albums.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Nirvana's Nevermind, Van Halen 1984, which was a huge album for Van Halen.  I had it.  Used to plug in the headphones, man.  Actually, I'll even give you that.  Nevermind sold 10 million.  1984 by Van Halen, sold 10 million.  Joshua Tree, U2, 10 million albums sold. 
[00:58:30]  Abbey Road, The Beatles, 12 million sold.  10 from Pearl Jam, 12 million sold.  Wow.  Purple Rain by Prince, 13 million sold.  Metallica's Black Album, 14 million sold.  14 million.  Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen, 15 million sold.  Wah-wah-wah.  Appetite for Destruction.  Well, I'm here in Jersey, and I'm...  Shut up.  Who likes Bruce?  With his four-hour stories.  Oh, aren't they awful? 
[00:59:00]  Hey, Wendy, I got a record.  Shut up.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Well, we went to the Jersey Shore in my...  Oh.  Wah-wah-wah.  He is the worst.  Every song's about a factory.  Just ponder.  That's closing.  Like, everybody's decent people who fucking work in those places.  And I grew up thinking that I'd work there, too.  But they closed it. 
[00:59:30]  Now where am I gonna work, Wendy?  Shut up.  Song goes on another 10 minutes.  So I got in my car.  So I got in my Chevy and went down to the shore.  Who cares?  Walk in the boardwalks of Jersey.  Shut up.  Wah-wah-wah.  How ponderous.  What a pompous ass thinking anyone wants to hear a 10-minute storytelling session from this idiot. 
[01:00:00]  About love, losing his job.  About anything.  Who cares?  That's like Carlos Mencia building his whole act around the greater San Diego area.  They finally gave a beaner a show.  Dude.  Anyone ever see the signs with the families crossing the street?  No.  Never.  It's pretty wacky.  I've never seen...  I live in Minnesota. 
[01:00:30]  I've never seen a family of Mexicans on a sign across the street.  Never, ever.  All right.  Well, Bruce Springsteen, born in the USA.  Born in the USA!  Oh, would I love to see his throat pop out.  80,000 idiots in Giants Stadium.  Oh, just chanting along with Bruce.  That sold 15 million copies.  15 million idiots.  Guns and roses.  Tough-skinned jeans. 
[01:01:00]  Working man denim.  Yeah.  That's what he's got on.  I'm on stage with a thermos.  I'm going to sing a couple of songs for you people.  And a bandana.  And I'm going to go dig a trench.  Sure you are.  Because I don't know any other way.  I'm just a working man from Jersey.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You know, he's like the Midwest's answer to like John Cougar Mellencamp.  Yeah.  He just sang about farms every fucking time.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Real relatable.  I can really relate to that one you did about cabbage there, John.  God, every time I'm out there picking the cabbage.  I'm an idiot.  He's doing a killer Bruce Springsteen, and I bring up some obscure douchebag.  No.  I agree wholeheartedly.  It's fine.  Appetite for Destruction.  Guns and Roses.  15 million copies sold.  Physical Graffiti.  Zeppelin, of course.  15 million copies sold.  And that's a double album, too, right?  Wow.  Yes.  Does that mean 30, or they sold 7 1⁄2? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  How does that work?  Love the big double album.  You can clean your pot on it easy.  The seeds rolled right down the seam.  The ancient days.  I did it to you again.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  What?  I'm just fucking...  That's how it works.  That's how it works.  You just plow ahead.  You contribute.  We just plow ahead.  Some of these are going to work.  Some will acknowledge, and some will just sit here uncomfortably and go, oh, Jesus,  that sucked.  We're just plowing ahead here in Jersey. 
[01:02:30]  You've got Robert Kelly on speed dial right now.  I do.  We might need you.  He's not making it past Wednesday.  I do want to acknowledge, I saw Dane Cook Friday, and Robert Kelly warmed up.  Holy shit.  In front of 5,000 people, he killed.  Yeah?  Absolutely killed.  We make fun of Robert Kelly a lot on this show.  Holy crap.  We do?  Yeah, I think we do.  There's this whole, I broke my knee, man, and everything else.  Anyway, there's one album out there that sold more than all of those.  That's not the top-selling album of all time, because people are getting confused. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, people are commenting, like, is it Dark Side of the Moon, which probably sold more  than all those albums, I would think.  Did it?  That's a good question.  Than?  You've got to think, if they have physical graffiti up here, that Zeppelin 4 sold a hell  of a lot more than 15 million copies.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of any other albums.  What Beatles album sold the most?  Sgt. Peppers.  If Abby wrote, it only sold 12 million. 
[01:03:30]  I bet Sgt. Peppers is probably the Beatles' top-selling album.  You think?  I'm just, you know, pulling it out of my ass.  This is us just...  Summer, Rubber Soul?  Rubber Soul.  This is us just guessing, and we'll never have the answer, by the way.  No.  In case you're playing along at home.  Oh, oh, oh, oh!  Where's Dark Side of the Moon?  Jesus, man!  The Recording Industry Association of America's top-selling albums of all time.  Wow.  The Big Countdown.  The Big Countdown.  We'll be doing this all morning. 
[01:04:00]  Wait, I want...  Coming in at number 10.  Two for Tuesdays.  Like, that's a two for...  Yeah, give me the 10.  Double shot.  Oh, we can't go 10, because there's a bunch of albums...  What?  Well, there's a bunch of albums in, like, let's say...  Tied for 10th?  Let's say in the 15 million category.  Get the lead out, coming up at 5.  Yeah, where we play Led Zeppelin for your ride home.  All right, here we go.  Here's, um...  Well, like, Boston's first album sold 17 million copies. 
[01:04:30]  Also, the Bodyguard soundtrack with Whitney Houston.  Just when you thought Boston's first album was huge.  Shut up.  She, uh...  That thing sold 17 million copies.  Slim Whitman.  Fleetwood Mac.  Rumors.  19 million copies.  Back in Black.  19 million copies.  How do you sell 19 million copies of anything?  Well, ask Shania Twain, because she also sold 19 million copies.  Very good, Opie.  Thank you. 
[01:05:00]  Let's see.  Zeppelin 4, 22 million copies.  The Wall by Pink Floyd, 23 million copies.  Thriller by Michael Jackson, 26 million copies.  And the top-selling album of all time is...  Ah.  Uh, sing along with Mitch Miller and the gang.  Sing along with Mitch.  That was my first record.  The Eagles' greatest hits, 1971 through 1975, 28 million copies.  That's the biggest-selling album of all time. 
[01:05:30]  Yes, but getting back to our cute little thing we were doing...  Wow.  Now that we confused the fuck out of everybody, all those albums I mentioned earlier,  there's one album that outsold all those great albums.  They're writing it down.  So what album has outsold The Eagles' greatest hits?  No!  I thought that's what you were getting at.  No?  That's the way you were phrasing it.  Yeah.  It was excellent news.  You know, keep the people watching the news, but probably vastly exaggerated. 
[01:06:00]  We can see there was no major outbreak of any...  This is the Imus in the Morning Program.  Yeah, I was told that, uh...  Oh, what is this?  That's the audio.  From today?  Yes.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  Steve.  When Steve fucks up, he works extra hard to make up for it.  I certainly do.  Yes, he does.  Here's Imus.  Brian Wilson is here this morning, and...  Uh, how are you, Brian?  Hi, I'm Brian Wilson.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Good. 
[01:06:30]  What's new, Opie?  No moment.  O&A Party Rock XM Show 2.  Hi, Anthony.  Good morning.  Sports are coming up.  Love them to lay on.  What the hell is going on with those guys over there?  You know, I tried to call Imus, but the number I got for him that he gave me a while ago...  Uh-oh, disconnected?  Yeah, I guess.  I can't get a hold of him.  I asked Eric, uh, I don't know, three or four days ago to get me a new Imus number, but...  Something tells me he changes his number a lot. 
[01:07:00]  He probably gets people that, uh, find out his number and call him.  I just wanted to call him and thank him for all the, you know, the plugs he's been giving  us on MSNBC.  Yeah.  During his morning show.  Anyway, so all those albums, should I do it again?  Real Fast, Nirvana, Van Halen, U2, Beatles, Pearl Jam, Purple Rain by, uh, uh, Prince there,  Metallica's Black Album, Born in the USA, Bruce Springsteen, Appetite for Destruction,  Guns and Roses, Physical Graffiti by Led Zeppelin, there's one album that has sold more than  those.  Uh, Thriller.  Not Thriller.  Oh, he's so upset, I'm ruining his bit. 
[01:07:30]  Wait a minute.  No!  No!  No!  Don't rip it!  What is it?  I want to know!  It's going to drive all the OCD people crazy today.  Fuck you all.  I don't remember.  It's the Eagles.  You're going to set them off!  1975, tonight, their second one.  It had to be.  Sometime during the program, I will just blurt out this band.  Ooh! 
[01:08:00]  No, I won't.  Ooh, keep listeners.  Let's say hi to Rx.  Rx!  Yo!  What's up, Rx?  What's up, guys?  It's the correct answer, um, Hootie and the Bluefish.  Ooh.  I'm not telling.  Good guess.  It's Tiffany.  Yes, it was supposed to be a quick, dumb thing.  Yes, Hootie and the Bluefish.  Saw it standing there, saw it standing there.  Cracked Rear View.  Oh, my God, what an album. 
[01:08:30]  Sold 16 million copies, beating out Physical Graffiti, Appetite for Destruction, Born in  the USA, The Black Album from Metallica, Purple Rain from Prince, Ten by Pearl Jam, Abbey  Road by The Beatles, Joshua Tree by U2, Van Halen's 1984, and Nevermind.  By Nirvana.  And you mentioned that you saw, what's his name, on a plane, right?  And no one cared.  I saw Darius Rutger.  What?  Rutger. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  I saw him on a plane, yeah.  And no one cared that he has outsold all those great albums.  The guy walked on, walked off, got his bag, left nobody, bugged this guy at all.  Could you imagine, you know, James Hetfield walking through the airport?  The guy would be mobbed.  Bruce Springsteen.  Springsteen.  Well, I landed at Newark and I'm driving to the shore.  Oh, yes.  Rev from Jersey's all pissed off at me.  Why?  Will Jersey ever get any respect in your eyes? 
[01:09:30]  And I defy you to name one big name artist from Long Island.  Excuse me, how about a guy named Billy Joel?  Sold a few records, didn't he?  How about a little lady named Pat Benatar?  How about a guy named Eddie Money?  How about...  You might know Eddie Money.  How about...  The all-time showing female.  That was a big drop-off, by the way.  Certainly was.  I got to Eddie Money.  Oh, no, it gets worse from there.  How about Blue Oyster Cult?  How about Twisted Sister?  How about Foghat?  How about...  Tell me what you want! 
[01:10:00]  Right.  Zebra.  Wow, now we've totally fallen off.  Who's behind the door?  Like, the members of Zebra, I used to do gigs with them when I was at BAB.  They were selling cars, and Randy Jackson decided to keep the whole Zebra thing going,  so he would do the whole show by himself.  Yeah.  You ever see, like, that one-man band that has all that stuff he has...  Like karaoke.  He walks around with a drum set attached to him, and then he has a guitar and everything 
[01:10:30]  else.  And the cymbals when he stomps his feet.  That's how the stage looked, and Randy Jackson was doing all the parts.  He didn't want anyone else...  Zebra.  Is Zebra even on Dilette?  It is?  Wow.  I'm amazed.  I've been wasting my time...  There he is.  Whoa!  Hey, it's Bob Buckman on WBAB.  It's Zebra.  Here's the Zebra twofer on this fine twofer Tuesday.  Wow!  This is your home of rock and roll. 
[01:11:00]  And Little Rock, Arkansas.  Give me flashbacks, Opie.  Yeah, here's a Long Island...  How about Joan Jett?  Joan Jett.  Joan Jett.  You know, there's one, you know, she's the all-time leading female recording artist of  all-time selling records.  Ooh!  Mariah Carey.  Oh, Mariah Carey.  Has sold more albums as a female artist than anyone else. 
[01:11:30]  So I don't want to hear it, Jersey.  How about Rotgut?  How about him?  It's got to be a VJ or something.  What's the baggage of the singer?  I mean, how is that the white...  All right.  Brian Wilson character's on Imus again today.  He...  It is so funny.  They do a radio show, but it's on TV.  Yeah.  But they only show his character every so often, but he sits there the whole show with  that retarded look on his face.  That retarded Brian Wilson look on his face.  And just looks around the studio and stares at stuff. 
[01:12:00]  Look at Imus, uh, yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.  With that hat?  He's got...  It looks like he just rode a horse.  There should be a horse tied up outside his studio.  Is there a hitching post?  I want a hitching post to tie my horse up before I do my, uh, my, uh, show deal thing.  Shut up, stupid.  See, there's a lot of people listening to us right now that are like, what's the big deal  with the cowboy hats?  Because they're in an area where it's acceptable.  We're in New York City.  Yeah.  When you walk around the streets of New York and you see a guy with a cowboy hat, he stands 
[01:12:30]  out and not in a good way.  You call him victim.  He looks like...  He looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  He's got those Eastern Airlines headphones.  Yeah, he doesn't wear the headphones.  Well, you can't wear headphones when you got that, uh, big cowboy hat on.  That's right.  You ought to just have him built into his hat.  Big, like, amplifier and that big tall section up top and the headphones on the side.  That's not a bad idea.  He's a rebel.  Why don't we get on Imus' show today?  Look at, like, the hat looks like it's supposed to, like, look at the hat band, has like a  sweat stain, like he's doing work on the ranch, I'm clearing a brush, uh, chopping wood. 
[01:13:00]  Can we get on Imus' show today?  How do we do that?  We will never be on Imus' show.  Let's give it a shot.  No, Viacom won't allow it.  Let's try it.  Won't allow it.  What's the request, uh, line number?  Oh, you just want to call in?  Yeah, we'll just call in.  Does he take just callers?  I don't know.  Well, let's figure you've got to be a high-profile politician to get through on that line.  Mark, New Jersey, what's up?  Yo.  Yeah.  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Hi, Jimmy's replacement.  It's Phil Burr. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, Mark, where do you live in Jersey?  Whoa, whoa.  Hey, uh, oh, I got a problem with you.  He didn't answer me.  What?  I got a problem with your list there.  All right.  You're missing Dark Side of the Moon.  Yeah, where was Dark Side of the Moon there, Nathaniel?  That's what I was asking for in the first place, Than.  Don't make us get you theme music.  You won't like it.  Yeah, you're trying to tell me the wall outsold Dark Side of the Moon?  The list you got is all fucked up.  You saw Dark Side?  I remember Dark Side of the Moon was like the number one selling album. 
[01:14:00]  Dark Side of the Moon only sold 15 million copies.  Yeah, it was kind of a drop-off after a while.  Shania Twain outsold Dark Side of the Moon?  Yeah.  Oh, these are famous people born in Jersey.  What about Long Island?  I'm working on it.  Yeah, let's go.  It's Long Island versus Jersey today.  All right, Travis.  We'll take on Jersey!  Any day.  Well, this is now all famous people, not just musicians.  All right.  We got people like Norman Schwarzkopf from Jersey.  Nice.  In Jersey.  The Outfield.  The Outfield. 
[01:14:30]  The Outfield.  Remember them?  We have the Stray Cats.  Kirsten Dunst.  Another Long Island band.  Ed Harris.  Ed Harris.  Dude, you guys got Janine Garofalo.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  John Travolta is from Jersey?  What about, um...  Yeah.  Used to look at the Jets flying over.  Ah.  Have you seen that awful story?  So, I named the first kid Jet.  Yeah, yeah, he did.  And he's a pilot.  He dresses like one, too. 
[01:15:00]  He dresses like an airline pilot.  He has his own 707 that he keeps at his house.  He's able to taxi a passenger jet, four-engine passenger jet, to his house and then out because  he has an airport at his house.  Where?  No shit.  You've never seen that?  But he has one of those old 7...  What is it?  707.  Yeah, where the Jets engines are a little bit smaller.  Yeah, they're smaller.  There's like four of them on the wings.  Yeah.  It's like the one that was used in the first airport movie.  You know, one of those? 
[01:15:30]  Elvis flew on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  And it's like an old TWA.  And he wears, like, the pilot thing.  So, it's like John Travolta in, like, a pilot uniform.  He wears the hat and everything.  It's about dancing at the disco and flying jets.  But he could taxi right to his mansion?  Yeah.  Holy crap.  He could taxi the plane right up to his mansion.  That's money.  Now you're a cunt.  Now you're a cunt.  Give back in, coach. 
[01:16:00]  John Travolta.  Okay.  Loretta Swit.  Meryl Streep.  Joe Pesci.  Of course, Bruce.  Queen Latifah.  Come on.  That drunken whore, Tara Reid.  Kevin Spacey.  Kevin Smith.  Ugh.  All right.  Donald Fagan.  Jersey has Billy Crudup.  Frank Sinatra.  Well.  They win.  Kevin Smith.  Frank Sinatra's a biggie.  Okay.  And Buzz Aldrin.  Walked on the fucking moon.  Yeah.  Come on.  What about Einstein?  Frank Sinatra.  Hoboken.  Einstein?  I mean, Thomas Edison. 
[01:16:30]  Thomas Alva Edison?  Yeah.  Was he born in Jersey or just set up shop there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's...  Back then...  I think he's from Edison.  Edison, New Jersey.  No.  What was Edison called before then?  Before Thomas Alva.  I hate that shit.  Shaquille O'Neal is from Newark.  See him on the path train ever?  Never.  Never see him on the path.  Joe Pesci.  Nice. 
[01:17:00]  Let's say hi to Jim.  Jim, what's up?  Nicholson?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Bill.  Great show Saturday.  Oh, thank you.  I saw the HBO half-hour comedy special last night, and bravo to Bill Burr.  It was awesome.  Oh, that airs tonight, if you didn't see it, 11 o'clock.  11 o'clock, if you missed Bill Burr on HBO and you don't have HBO on demand.  Hey, I wanted to ask how little Jimmy's doing and if he's going to be calling in today.  Little Jimmy.  We've been in touch with him the last couple of days, and I think he's supposed to call in today  because he went to Rich Voss' wedding and he started the table reading for the HBO series. 
[01:17:30]  So, we should get an update, hopefully today, maybe tomorrow.  Cool.  Also, Anthony, I've got a house for you.  Oh, you do?  Yes.  What is it?  It's 2,200 square feet.  Uh-huh.  It's in a small town in Illinois.  Illinois, huh?  Yeah.  The commute's kind of a bitch, my friend.  I know.  I know.  But it's a little, it's a picture-upper, but I need to sell this thing.  Is there a punchline, or are we wasting our time here? 
[01:18:00]  Sir, you're plummeting.  I'm plummeting.  I'm burning.  I'm burning.  I'm burning out.  You're losing cabin pressure.  Yeah.  Wow.  The oxygen would drop down from the top.  Just put the rubber hose in your nose.  That's got to be something.  Hey, guys, I got conversation starters.  What?  Because you can't just sit there and look pretty.  Hmm.  Because you can't just sit there and look pretty. 
[01:18:30]  They're conversation starters, so if you're at a party, you can't just sit around and look  pretty or handsome.  Oh, so you can walk up to maybe a group or a person.  So I got some things, and then you're sitting there.  Oh, I thought that was what you were supposed to say to the girl.  She's sitting there.  You just walk up and go.  Because you can't just sit there and look pretty.  And she was going to respond to it.  That's it?  That's all Long Island has to offer?  Wow.  And this is all of New York.  No.  Travis.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, what happened?  The New York list is really big, and I'm sure that there's more, but some of them just 
[01:19:00]  say New York on there.  Oh, I see.  This is Long Island.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're fucking with the whole state.  All right.  You want the whole state of New York?  No, this is good.  All right.  That is funny that they actually compared Long Island to an entire state.  To an entire state.  Right.  Jersey.  Long Island, we got Ashanti.  Uh-huh.  Oof.  All the Baldwins.  Come on.  We own the fucking Baldwins from Massapequa.  Lenny Bruce.  The Baldwins are your Kennedys.  One thing's for sure. 
[01:19:30]  With song titles like The Place Your Love Calls Home and The Ghost of a Chance.  All right.  We missed them again.  Yeah.  Lenny Bruce.  Yeah.  Mariah Carey.  Billy Crystal.  Yep.  Rodney Dangerfield is from Babylon.  Mm-hmm.  Howard Dean.  Mm-hmm.  Sarah Hughes, your sister.  Yes, that's right.  She won a gold medal at the Olympics.  At the Olympics.  Very proud of her.  Billy Joel.  Not my sister, by the way.  A cousin.  Oh, cousin?  Yep.  Everyone's favorite fat dyke, Rosie O'Donnell.  Mm-hmm.  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
[01:20:00]  Mm-hmm.  From Southampton.  Who's that?  Thomas Pinchon.  Yeah.  Pinchon.  Franklin Roosevelt.  That's right.  Telly Savalas.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Rod Steiger, James Van Praag, and the immortal Walt Whitman.  They named a mall after him in Huntington.  I was going to say, the guy that builds malls?  The Walt Whitman Mall.  Would you guys like a conversation starter or not?  I certainly would. 
[01:20:30]  Would you, Bill?  Absolutely.  Who wouldn't?  Jet Blue Airways.  Oh, denied.  I think that was bound for glory, my friend.  You definitely stopped it.  Who has flown Jet Blue Airways?  I have.  I have.  I had to fly it to the Bahamas.  Direct flight, by the way, which is nice.  You don't have to stop in Miami.  It's the first time in years I haven't flown first class because, Opie, they have no first 
[01:21:00]  class.  What do you think of the upholstery on those?  The leather seats?  Looking like it was, like, you know, the leather jacket you forgot about and it's in the back  of your hatchback all wadded up.  That's the way all those seats.  All hard.  Yeah, they're all wrinkled.  But they got basic cable.  Yeah.  Which is the shit.  Right there.  You just watch ESPN the whole way out.  And that make the flight go by so much quicker.  Unbelievably, it really is good.  I enjoyed my Jet Blue experience.  Yeah, Jet Blue does a very fine job.  Well, Jet Blue Airways, here's a conversation starter for everybody, awards mortuaries a free 
[01:21:30]  round-trip ticket for about every 15 dead bodies they ship.  Whoa.  Exactly.  Wait, they're shipping dead people?  They're shipping dead people on almost every plane that you're on.  Now, the obvious thing is, what happens during a crash?  Do they, like, count that?  Of course they do.  You've got to find the remains again.  Again.  Listen to this.  You've got to find...  Listen to this.  Wow. 
[01:22:00]  Jet Blue...  They could be all set for an open casket.  I missed that.  And then all of a sudden, you're burnt up and...  I'm going to say it again, because I think Bill did miss this.  All right.  This is a conversation starter.  Or something you could just bring up at a party, and then you'll have a nice discussion.  Jet Blue Airways awards mortuaries a free round-trip ticket for about every 15 dead bodies  they ship.  Nicknamed frequent dire programs.  Many airlines offer tickets or frequent flyer miles to funeral directors who ship bodies 
[01:22:30]  on their planes.  Wow.  Oh, I thought they meant, like, if 15 of your relatives die...  You get a free ticket.  Yeah.  We've established motive.  Little consolation.  Free ticket.  Is it true that 15 of your family members died?  Objection.  Objection.  15...  So, for every 15...  That you ship.  That you ship.  Every 15 dead bodies.  They give them your...  You get a free ticket.  They give them your free ticket.  Because what...  What's Jet Blue's advantage? 
[01:23:00]  They charge him by, like, weight or something like that?  Yeah, that's probably...  Because what, do they charge you over 50 pounds on your baggage?  Yeah.  Some fat fuck dies?  I've never seen a coffin being loaded in, though, with the luggage and stuff.  Because that would just be creepy as you're sitting there waiting for the plane to take  off.  It's a bad...  We all have looked out the window and see the luggage going into the plane.  You're right.  Sure, we all have.  You just sound like you're doing like a...  Sorry.  You're just like, we've all looked out the window.  I was saying something off. 
[01:23:30]  I have, too.  Yeah, you know what they do?  But when do they throw the coffin on?  Do you want to make more money?  Sure, we all do.  I was setting up.  I just wanted...  Paralegal.  Mechanic.  Stenographer.  Private investigator.  It's the number one thing you do in radio.  You sit there and you say, we all have looked out the window to see them, you know, putting  the luggage on the plane.  We all do.  Everyone out there in Radio Land is like, yeah, yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, but that was the...  And then they relate.  See, we try to relate to our audience on a daily basis.  But that was the radio version of being a comedian.  Like, come on, back me up, ladies.  I mean, come on now.  We've all done this.  Look at this guy over here.  He knows what I'm talking about.  We've all looked out the window, haven't we?  So you're trying to say, as a comedian, you try to relate to your people...  No, I'm just...  You just kind of used a hacky phrase.  You've looked out the window.  Sure.  We all have.  You know what you were missing was, like, the hand gesture pointing to an audience that 
[01:24:30]  isn't here watching.  But you know what?  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that was a little hokey.  Oh, is that good?  Oh.  All right.  So anyways...  Wow.  You know what?  I'm not going to tell you the rest of this.  No, don't rip...  Jeepers.  Creepers.  It's becoming a theme.  I want a conversation starter.  All right.  You've got to finish.  How am I going to...  Have you ever flown...  Have you flown Delta Airlines? 
[01:25:00]  Yes, I have.  Bill?  Delta Airlines?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Delta is ready when you are.  Delta Airlines...  How many dead bodies do you think they transport a year?  Delta Airlines.  A year.  What would your guess be?  3,000.  3,000?  That'd be...  Oh.  A year.  A year.  Every single year they're doing this.  3,000 a year.  I bet it's even more than that.  I mean, how many flights do they have a day?  I mean, it just boggles the mind. 
[01:25:30]  Ready for this?  I'm going to say 3,200.  Bastard.  3,201.  3,001.  3,201.  I'm going to get the refrigerator.  I want to play Plinko.  I meant to play this.  Yeah.  You're both wrong.  You both overbid.  No, you underbid, but...  Underbid.  6,000.  Delta Airlines.  And one.  Transports.  50,000 dead bodies per year. 
[01:26:00]  50,000?  A year?  A year.  That's like everyone that died in NAMM.  Just on Delta Airlines.  On one airline.  One airline shipping 50,000 dead bodies a year.  A lot of people are dropping far from home, I guess.  That must be it.  It's the only reason I could see for flying a dead body.  Guys?  Send them through the x-ray machine.  Yeah.  Send them through security.  Would you like another conversation starter?  Of course.  Can you tell I read some magazines overnight? 
[01:26:30]  Getting all spread across this floor like a fucking serial killer.  Trying to make a ransom note.  There's got to be some comedy in here.  That's what you do, man.  Just wait till you see what I got on Yogi Berra coming up.  Yes.  I read that one.  It's called Merchandise 7X.  I don't know what that means.  By Coca-Cola employees, the formula for classic Coke is kept in a bank vault in Atlanta. 
[01:27:00]  Very secret.  So the recipe is called Merchandise 7X.  Okay?  It is kept in a bank vault in Atlanta.  But it's seldom, if ever seen, the recipe for Coke.  For Coke, the company's bylaws specify that the formula is to be known to only two high-ranking Coke executives at any one time who reportedly may not fly in the same plane. 
[01:27:30]  Stop it.  That's ridiculous.  So wait a minute.  And the recipe?  If only two guys know how to make the Coke.  Right, yeah.  Then how do all the...  I mean...  Yeah.  What are the two guys with bottles?  Yeah.  Shut that door.  Like, of course there are people that know how to make it.  They probably have, like, the beginning five ingredients, and then every other factory has their two ingredients.  And the guys from the first room can't go into the second room.  But even then, you'd have to make all those five ingredients. 
[01:28:00]  We need to know more about this one.  That doesn't make any sense.  Can we find out about this on the internet?  Yeah.  I think this is hype.  Is that...  And the recipe is passed down by word of mouth.  I know where to go.  Do you know where to go for this?  I know where to go to find it.  What?  What?  CokeWars.com?  Right.  No.  I'm going to my urban legend site.  Put in Coke.  Coca-Cola. 
[01:28:30]  He's doing your fucking job, man.  Go to that one.  Acid.  Is Coca-Cola formula known to only two people?  Here it is.  Only two Coca-Cola execs know Coke's formula.  Each of them only knows half of it.  Status.  False.  For three quarters of a century, rumors about the measures Coca-Cola company has employed  to keep its formula secret.  Uh-huh.  Well, it's bullshit.  See that?  At least one of the ingredients.  A little quality control over here. 
[01:29:00]  With your magazines.  Here's an interesting fact.  Conversation starter.  Only one chisel was used to make Mount Rushmore.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's right here in time.  Citrate caffeine.  Vanilla extract.  Yeah.  Flavoring.  F.E.  Cocoa.  Citric acid.  Lime juice.  Sugar.  Water.  Caramel.  Sufficent. 
[01:29:30]  There you go.  A Coke hitman's going to come in here right now.  Yeah, before I blurt out the last ingredient.  Put two behind your ear.  Some silent shot comes to the window from the Parker Meridian Hotel.  Pepsi spies in a van.  Damn it!  We lost the feet!  Yeah, that's urban myth.  Any more there?  Yeah.  No.  Tell us about the kidneys being sold on the black market.  You know, the guy that woke up in the bathtub of ice with a note that said, get to the hospital? 
[01:30:00]  Done.  How about the, uh...  The one-night stand.  He wakes up and then written in lipstick on the mirror.  Congratulations.  Now you have AIDS.  Yes.  Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS.  How about the, um, the guy that went to the wedding?  And, uh, at the toast, uh, the, uh...  How do you start one of those?  The groom told everybody to turn their plate over and the picture was of the bride having sex with the best man.  Right.  How do you start one of those?  You had, like, all your interns go to bars around Manhattan.  Yeah.  And tell the same fucking story.  Wouldn't that get started?  It wouldn't work.  It would never work. 
[01:30:30]  Somehow, those...  One guy had to tell it at first.  And he's around going, hey, you hear my story?  It's everywhere now.  Yeah.  How does that happen?  That was me.  That was me.  I'm one of the best fucking liars.  My lie is everywhere.  Don't make me go into the 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born list from Blender Magazine.  Now I think we could safely say you read a little too much last night.  The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.  Is there a power outage in your building? 
[01:31:00]  Fucking sitting there by a candlelight.  Just reading.  No, he's an asshole standing at the newsstand.  Hey, buddy, you going to buy that?  No.  I decided to step it up today.  Yes.  Thank God.  All right.  Does anyone care about the 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born?  Absolutely.  Best song since 1980.  Since 1980.  Best song.  Susudio.  It's got to be.  Susudio. 
[01:31:30]  This is Susudio.  Let me think.  Since 1980 till now?  Yeah.  500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.  Should I give this list to Dirk so he can play to you?  I will say Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Smells Like Teen Spirit came in fifth place.  Fifth?  I've cut the list in half.  Fifth place.  Bill, would you like to guess one of the top 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born?  Top 500 and I hit number five? 
[01:32:00]  How about top ten?  Well, we'll go with top ten, but Blender, you know, they spent...  How about White Lion's cover of Radar Love?  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be up there.  That's got to be number two.  Sorry.  No, it's too long.  Apologies.  Number ten.  In Da Club by 50 Cent.  Number nine.  Britney Spears in Baby One More Time.  Are you kidding?  Wait.  500 songs.  500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  What are they remembering about?  Going back to 1980s.  And that's number nine?  Yes.  No, I can't agree with that.  Run DMC in eighth place with Sucker MCs.  No.  Sorry.  Huh?  Sorry, I don't agree with that either.  Why?  Because.  Because he's racist.  Yeah, that too, but...  The Joy Division, a song called Love Will Tears Apart.  What was that about?  What?  Is this album sold?  This is two hip-for-the-room people.  These are just greatest songs since you were born. 
[01:33:00]  No, it's not.  This is Joy Division right here.  It's seventh place.  Love Will Tears Apart on your home of rock and roll.  New Jersey, are you listening tonight?  I've never heard this.  Oh, I know this one.  Sounds a little 80s.  I'm picturing Molly Ringwald dancing.  I was going to say, is this one pretty in pink?  You beat me to it.  Of course it sounds like this. 
[01:33:30]  Look at Larry Singh's awful arm.  Look at that thing.  It looks fake.  Why is he on Imus?  He's on Imus.  God, Imus gets some good guests.  I'm here with the Iron Man.  We were doing well with guests for a while there,  and then all of a sudden it went back down to Schittsville.  The bat came off the wall.  Schittsville and you, perfect together.  Wow, who do we have? 
[01:34:00]  Fuck, man.  It's so easy to compete with all the other morning shows out there.  Yeah.  Imus has Larry King on.  Who do we have, guys?  Who do we have?  Julia from Coed Magazine talking about sex.  And for the hundredth time on our program, Gene Simmons of KISS.  Hundredth time.  Holy shit.  Do we have anything new to learn from Gene?  No.  None.  Nothing.  All right.  Moving on.  The sixth greatest song since we were born, 
[01:34:30]  or since you were born, because it goes back to only 1980.  That would be Madonna Like a Prayer.  Fifth place, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Nirvana.  That's what I said.  Fourth place, U2.  Yeah.  And one.  Mm-hmm.  Third place, Sweet Child, Oh Mine.  Not Of.  A lot of people think it's Of Mine.  Oh.  Guns N' Roses.  Second place, believe it or not, is OutKast and B.O.B.  What? 
[01:35:00]  Derek?  Yeah.  You know it?  One, two, one, two, three.  Yeah.  It's just national underground, thunderbolts, and I stop the ground.  Yeah, it's just pretty good, though.  I like the OutKast.  This is the second greatest song since you were born?  No.  No.  I won't give it that.  How did Britney Spears get in there?  Yeah.  Britney does not belong in there.  You know, one awful day in my life when I was on the road in Cleveland, I actually went 
[01:35:30]  to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh.  We went there.  I refused.  We all went there.  We actually have, like, you know, I thought it was, you know, I had some, like, you know,  obviously the Hall of Fame guys, but in the beginning when you first walk in there, they  actually had clothes that Britney Spears wore.  And it was one of the first exhibits that you saw, and you were just like, are you fucking  kidding me?  Why?  Who cares?  That's going to have a high turnover rate, the case where her clothes are.  Like, there's somebody coming up right now that's going to be in that case.  Jessica Simpson's thong is in there now. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  It's got to be.  I wasn't too impressed.  The building's awesome and all, but.  There is no way I was going that day.  It's like, you want to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Why do I want to go to the Hard Rock without a burger?  Because that's pretty much what it is.  It's the Hard Rock, no food.  It was a lot of shit that obviously just came from, you know, addicts after these people  died.  Yeah.  Stuff they didn't even care about.  Yeah, unbelievably.  John Bonham's drum kit was the only cool thing I saw there.  Like, he had one, though. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, I know.  That's like the one that was used once in a studio, or.  That was the one he was thinking about using for Moby Dick, but decided not to.  But he was thinking about it, so we got to, you know, put it on his plate.  Yeah, put it up there.  He probably never even played it.  Ludwig sent him all these drums.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Give me the ugly green sparkle.  Give me the sticks he used to tap out Moby Dick.  All right.  And the greatest song since you were born means the best song since 1980. 
[01:37:00]  The number one song is.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  So what do we got coming up next?  I don't know.  We'll find out after these messages.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I'd like some more free time to relate to the listeners.  I have no time in my Saturn to relate to them at all.  Oh, I'm punching around town trying to find whores in a family sedan. 
[01:37:30]  Fucking loser.  Do you lease or did you buy?  Bought.  You bought.  First time I ever owned a car.  It's all paid off?  Yeah, yeah.  Three years.  And what are you going to, are you going to keep it?  Or are you going to upgrade it?  I have like 30,000 on it, dude, but it's having some problems.  It's running a little bit sluggish.  It's kind of, I've brought it to the same Saturn dealership like 30 times.  I'm still having like these weird little problems.  It's like, just make it run better.  My fucking engine light won't stop coming on.  Dude, it's running sluggish because it's a Saturn.  It's a three-year-old Saturn.  Who are you kidding?  My other Saturn, I've had this much.  I got 160,000 out of my other one. 
[01:38:00]  Really?  Dude, this one has only not started one time.  I've had great success with these cars.  That's why I buy it.  Only not started one time.  That's one time too many.  No, but this is why I like Saturn.  It was a battery.  It was like some kind of a battery.  What did you do?  Did you hit your OnStar and go, my car won't start?  And they send somebody and fix it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But my OnStar is even better than yours because it comes in my pocket and Sprint does it.  So I just, I pick it up.  No, actually, it's twice didn't start.  Once it actually just broke down.  Yeah.  I really had enough of this fucking Saturn.  Three years and you already have it breaking down on you.  Yeah, this one's not as good as the other ones, man. 
[01:38:30]  I've had some good ones.  I don't know, though, dude.  You beat the crap out of your cars.  Not really, dude.  I got less than 30,000 on it in three years.  I used to do 30,000 a year when I was living in Jersey.  90,000 by this point is what I would have on it and it was still going good.  It's tough city miles, though.  Yeah, that's true.  How many brake jobs have you had?  I think only one.  One?  Yeah.  30 miles driving in the city?  Yeah.  30,000 miles, I mean?  Don't forget, sometimes I'll go out and do gigs or whatever, but most of us.  Is your door all scratched up from Tranny's fake nails hitting the side of it?  Yeah, well, like two feet down from there are big mules banging into the side. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  A dent in your door?  Yeah.  You got a mule dent.  Hi, Daddy.  Sometimes I only crack the window, so I get lipstick prints on the very top of my window.  I won't open it because they'll put their heaving hands in.  What could I do for you, Daddy?  That big lips.  Dance.  Dance.  What are you doing, Daddy?  Oh, lipstick marks on your window.  Yeah, because you open the window like an inch just so they can shat into it.  It's like an old lady's coffee cup. 
[01:39:30]  O.P. and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  There's too many men, too many people, making too many problems, and there's not a lot of  blood to go around.  And you see, this is a land of confusion.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, that's cool.  Is that Disturb?  Yeah, it is.  Disturb doing Genesis Land of Confusion, right? 
[01:40:00]  Nice.  Well, they had some success with Shout, doing their cover of Shout on their first album there.  Wow.  And I like Disturb.  I love Disturb.  Yeah.  There's rumors that the singer was wearing an ONA Pest t-shirt on the stage.  Or Spread the Virus t-shirt.  Instead, ONA Party Rock from the stage.  Yeah, they are fans, and the t-shirts and the stickers are being handed out, but I don't  know.  Until I see a picture, I don't know if I'm going to believe that. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  But they are being handed out at the shows.  That'd be huge.  Hey, guys, if you're fans and you're listening, please call.  We would love to have you.  We will blow off the always trying to hawk his wares, Gene Simmons for you guys.  That's right.  Please.  A couple of instant feedbacks coming in.  Case from California.  Greatest song since Anthony was born has got to be the National Anthem.  Oh, you look great, but we're starting to think you might be a vampire or something.  We really don't know how old you are anymore.  I am not.  You know, the Groucho thing is throwing a lot of people off. 
[01:41:00]  Just because I met Groucho Marx.  Say no more.  Pat from Menachie.  Since Anthony was born, the greatest song has got to be Rudy Valley's When I'm Calling  You.  When I'm calling you.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my ragtime gal.  Is that the song?  I don't know which one that is.  I've never heard of such things.  I met Groucho in 1975 when I was a small child and he was near death. 
[01:41:30]  He met him when he was running the New York Marathon in 1938.  Fighting age.  I did not.  Ladies and gentlemen, all the ships are safe.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  Morse code.  I did not.  How easy was it to write a hit back then?  You could come up with that horse shit.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my ragtime gal.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  So easy.  The cool guys have that song blaring how they have their Sotos. 
[01:42:00]  All you have to do is, poop-poop-ee-doo.  That in the song.  Poop-poop-ee-doo.  You got a hit.  Dan, dan, dan, dan.  It's a Charleston.  Some lame-o song.  Ah, poop-poop-ee-doo.  That's only the first shit you would just play.  Like, two notes.  Ba-da.  Ba-da.  Da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, horrible stuff.  It's so, like, so involved and intricate now, and, you know, a lot of different instruments  and synthesizers.  Don't say it under the apple tree.  What anyone else want me?  Anyone else want me?  Anyone else want me?  No, no, no.  You're getting pussy off of that.  People mobbing you.  You fucking raccoon coat. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, damn, is that funny?  And that was probably considered the devil's music to other people that were around in that era, you know?  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  They were listening, too, that that's the devil music.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  Makes people want to fornicate.  This type of music is the devil's music.  That's the guy born in 1876.  Scott Chaplin.  That's good music. 
[01:43:30]  This land is your land.  You know what?  Yes, Opie?  I think I want to clean up my area.  Stop it.  Those things have been sitting there for about a year.  What happens is the guys, we have a great crew behind the scenes,  and they're always finding stuff for us to play on the show.  And a lot of this stuff piles up because we'll just go off on a two-hour tangent about nothing.  And then we have actual really good stuff that we should have got to and we never get to it.  And then it gets older and older.  And then we like, I don't know. 
[01:44:00]  Then we put a rubber band.  A rubber band goes around it.  Around it.  So then you don't even look at it anymore because it's a pile of stuff.  Yeah, Opie's got, like, CDs in front of them that are all loose.  And every day I see them, like, thumbing through them and stuff.  And, hey, what do you think of this?  And then there's the ones that have the rubber bands around them that just never see the light of day.  Never.  Well, here's one thing.  We did start really late in the show last week.  Diddy teaching Martha...  Martha.  Martha.  Diddy teaching Martha Stewart how to rap.  Remember the dude's chills we got? 
[01:44:30]  So bad.  A lot of people commented on a bunch of the websites and fan sites that this stuff was so bad we had no comments.  It didn't need it.  It spoke for itself.  Stand alone.  Well, remember this one.  This is the only one I think we played last week.  And then we'll play the others.  I'm here with my bro, Diddy.  And I'm so excited because he's going to teach me how to rap.  Now, I just want you to notice.  Wes, what are the security guards doing?  PB and J's.  Oh, they're eating.  See, they took me out. 
[01:45:00]  That is so great.  Well, first of all, what I really want to know is what are the meanings of, like, these few words, okay?  Cheddar.  Little 101.  Is cheddar cheese?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  Why is she getting a laugh out of that?  Because her white audience is there.  It's cheddar cheese.  When the world ends, right, and someone was filming it and they were just pulling the camera shot away from the earth and everyone died,  that audio should be playing in the background. 
[01:45:30]  Like, we just all died of stupidity.  And you just keep pulling away.  Perfect.  All the way out into space.  It's just fucking horrific.  Cheddar's money.  That's an image.  Oh.  Cheddar.  Okay.  Cheddar's money.  Okay.  Shorty.  Okay.  I don't know if that's a little bitch.  I'm tallie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're tallie.  You're tallie.  You're tallie.  I've seen your daughter.  Yeah.  You know, I would call her a shortie.  Because she's like six feet tall?  No, no, no.  No, she's a young pretty thing. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she's a shortie.  Oh, I'm tallie, see.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've heard it the first two times.  No, you're cunty.  Which is?  What you're doing right now with that $8 million piece of ice around your neck.  That's Florsen.  Benjamin's, which you make a lot of, that's $100 bill.  That's money.  Oh, Benjamin Franklin.  Yeah, yeah.  It means money.  Okay, but what does Florsen have to do with not flossing your teeth?  No, Florsen is just over the top, so it's just.  Okay, and then ballin'. 
[01:46:30]  Ballin'.  I mean, I know what ballin' is.  She's like the white cop on Sanford and Son.  Oh, remember him?  What's going off?  Hey, it's the Sanfords.  Yeah, and they walk in and get all the slang wrong.  He was always in his underwear.  Had a big ant on the front of it.  That's what I found fucking hilarious about that.  Like, black people always trash white people about how stupid, you know, we make them look.  And then the second they meet, Paul Mooney and all those guys are writing on that shit.  Okay, we'll have a white cop come in.  He's in his underwear, and he's a fucking moron.  Every show, it's just like, you're doing it too. 
[01:47:00]  Paul Mooney wrote for us, Everton, Son?  Yeah.  Now it makes perfect sense.  Who is fucking hilarious if you've never seen him.  Oh, I've seen him, yeah.  Hysterical.  But man, he is angry.  Oh, it's great.  Oh, is he angry at the white man?  The best thing is, yeah, he plays Carolines all the time,  and you get, like, those tourists who have no idea who he is.  Like, oh, a comedy show.  Oh, this is good.  This could be stepping off that red double-decker bus.  Yeah.  And they walk in there.  He just trashes the shit out of them. 
[01:47:30]  I wonder if this guy's going to be like Sinbad.  No.  No.  Nothing like it.  What is it to rap?  Oh, okay.  Ball into rap.  Was that a fucking joke?  Ball into rap is living life to the fullest.  It's just, you know, um...  Oh, okay.  Having a ball.  Having a ball.  There you go.  Work hard, you play hard.  Okay.  Wow.  Why is she allowed to be on TV?  She stinks.  What's Diddy doing?  What is he doing? 
[01:48:00]  I don't know.  Well, he doesn't have any, uh, like, artists right now.  No.  Once Biggie, uh, died, that was it.  That was...  He was like Biggie's little cohort.  He was like the underling.  The guy no one really paid attention to.  And then Biggie died.  He gets huge.  He does that tribute song to the Sting song.  And then that gave him license to just do this?  He's got, like, he has a new line of rims coming out.  I'm serious.  He's got the rims. 
[01:48:30]  He's got his clothing line.  Black Gene Simmons.  Yeah, exactly.  He had those, the white parties out in the Hamptons where everyone had to dress in white.  The puffy, bulletproof vest.  Yeah.  Regis was invited to these parties.  He's inviting Regis Philbin to his parties.  The guy can't have any credibility left with any of the real street guys anymore.  None.  Martha Stewart.  Well, it continues.  We've got more clips.  Listen to this one.  Now we're going to try to put some of it together. 
[01:49:00]  There's some lyrics from one of my songs called the Benjamins.  And, you know, the first song that I taught you.  Were you making lots of Benjamins when you wrote this song?  No.  Did this make you lots of Benjamins?  After this song.  Benjamins.  You know, a lot of things about rap people is like we kind of put out there our dreams  and things we want to achieve.  And so this is the Benjamins.  I wanted to make a lot of Benjamins.  When did you write this?  This was before.  This was in 1995.  1995.  Okay. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  And so the first song that we learned when we were in the garden watering the flowers together,  I love the way you had your clarity.  Now with this song, I need some attitude.  You know what I'm saying?  You've got to put yourself into it.  Okay.  Okay.  See?  I'm learning.  I'm learning.  So I'm going to say it.  Okay.  Want to be ballers, shot callers.  So ask them the question.  Okay.  Want to be ballers, shot callers.  I'm not going to be able to listen to this.  Yeah, I can't.  I can't.  Okay? 
[01:50:00]  Oh my God, no.  What's the problem?  I can't listen to this.  Why?  Because she's rapping.  She's trying to...  She's learning how to rap.  I can't.  This is so...  So embarrassment-inducing.  Oh!  Now we're going to go from here.  Oh, no.  No, we're not.  Who'd be dipping in the bins with the spoilers?  Who'd be dipping in the bins with the spoilers?  Okay.  I know what that means.  Okay.  Now this is a very... 
[01:50:30]  This is a very important one.  Okay?  Yeah.  On the low from the Jake and the Taurus.  On the low and the Jake from the Taurus.  Okay.  One more time.  Okay.  On the low from the Jake and the Taurus.  On the low from the Jake and the Taurus.  Okay, now...  Now Jake's in the Taurus, which is a lesser car than the Benz.  Yeah.  The Jake is the police.  Okay?  Okay.  Oh!  Okay, I don't know that.  We got to be on the low from the Jake.  Stop it!  Who's in the Taurus.  Oh, the Ford Taurus. 
[01:51:00]  Okay, now we are going to end this discussion right now.  We don't want to give the Jake too much information so they can decipher our window.  Just a couple of criminals hitting it off.  Great.  Very great.  Very great.  And finally, this douche chill.  Okay, so ready to rap?  Let's go, man.  Okay.  Okay.  What you want to do? 
[01:51:30]  Want to be ballers?  Shot cold.  Who likes to trawlers?  On your shoulders.  Now, here you go.  You've been in the Benz with the Taurus.  On the low from the Jake and the Taurus.  Who you going to have?  It's just a great slap.  I like it.  I like it, girl.  I like it.  I'm so glad I can't see this video.  Give a round of applause.  But I pictured it in my head and it was bad enough.  When we come back, I'll be rapping dumplings at the Lipshaw Dumpling House.  Oh, my God.  I'll be rapping dumplings.  Get it? 
[01:52:00]  We're going to have some hip-hop corn coming up.  You should be assassinated.  Oh, crap.  They should have, like, the ghetto boys go in there and teach us some of that rap.  Really.  NWA.  NWA.  Get in there.  Teach us some of that.  Teach us some of EZ's old shit.  Mystical should go in there and sexually assault her.  Wow, was that really, really bad.  Yeah, and it was worse the second time.  Yep. 
[01:52:30]  Rapping.  The New York Black Street Slang Exam.  Where did we get this from?  Travis.  Courtesy of Travis.  Well, that's kind of taking a risk coming in here with material that doesn't really know  how we'll take to it.  How do you say excuse me or pardon me or sorry?  You just don't.  It's a trick question, isn't it?  Sorry?  Is that my bad?  My bad.  My bad.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Thank you.  Dude, you're like the whitest person in the studio.  Exactly.  Nah, he hangs in the community.  All right.  How about if someone says,  I, uh, to you on the street, what is your reply?  See you later, then.  Wow.  Pull out your cell phone and dial 911.  The answer would be aight.  Aight.  Aight.  Derivative of all right.  Well.  I'm a snuff you means. 
[01:53:30]  Oh.  Means I'm gonna kill you.  I'm gonna punch you.  I'm gonna kill you.  I'm gonna leave you.  All of the above.  I'm a snuff you means.  I say kill you.  Bill?  Oh, I thought you were saying it meant all that shit.  I'll kill you.  Uh, snuff you, uh, I'm gonna leave you.  Uh, you're both wrong.  It's I'm gonna punch you.  I'm gonna punch you?  I'm willing to bet no one says that.  She gotta guess.  I'm gonna snuff you. 
[01:54:00]  Snuff just.  By the way, it doesn't work.  When I was watching your half hour comedy special on HBO last night, that voice you do really  makes me laugh hard.  That, I was just commenting on it yesterday when I was home.  I was hoping you were gonna finally do it on our show.  Did you do it on our show?  Yeah, yeah.  Yesterday, there was some, and I just started laughing.  My girl voice and my gay guy voice, you can't, you can't really, you have to have like perfect  pitch as a musician to tell the difference.  But it's perfectly annoying.  The girl voice is hilarious. 
[01:54:30]  What are you doing, Mike?  I was laughing yesterday, I listened to the replay, I was like, I love that voice, man.  Oh, that, the second I started doing that chunk of material, the amount of women who  would come up, like, maybe like every weekend anyways, because I'm a fucking howdy-do-looking  idiot, I might get three.  One of them was a divorce waitress, but the second I started doing that bit, it dropped  off to zero.  Really?  Yeah, they just felt like it.  I would just give you, you hate women.  You can totally fucking see it.  It's like, why don't you look behind, stop taking it, you know, fucking face value. 
[01:55:00]  Let me see issues.  Bill Burr's half-hour comedy special re-airs tonight, right?  Yes, it does, at 11 o'clock.  11 o'clock on HBO.  She got a gas face means, A, she has light skin, B, she's very happy, C, she's giving  you a dirty look, D, none of the above.  Dirty look.  She's giving you a dirty look, yes, Bill Burr.  Wow.  That's what she got a gas face means.  Oh, here it is.  Who are those two white dudes who used to sing there?  Late 80s. 
[01:55:30]  You looped it.  You looped it.  Oh.  Wait.  Oh.  You know those two fuckers, the guy with the, you know, we need somebody black in here.  They were white guys, though.  Come on, the guy had the cane, he was kind of cool looking.  There you go.  Third base, there you go.  Weasel.  What?  Pop goes the weasel.  Yeah, third base, pop goes the weasel.  And they had another one called the gas face.  Yeah, Lazzle's here.  What's up, Lazzle?  Look at you.  Look at you.  Little Yo MTV raps.  I don't go that deep.  I'm very surface with the hip hop. 
[01:56:00]  That's where you got your info?  Yeah.  I don't buy any mixtapes.  It's the ball means what?  It's great.  It's the shit.  That's good.  Very good.  Nine pound means what?  Nine pound?  Yeah.  The amount of coke you got in your trunk.  Nine pound.  You can't carry weight.  Nine pound.  Remember the days you used to be able to figure this shit out?  Yeah, you can't figure it out anymore.  Nine pound means the year 1995. 
[01:56:30]  It's doing some kind of equation on the...  I'm trying to see LB, L...  Well, what happened in that year in the black community that they need to hide that from us?  LB.  So the...  I don't know.  All right.  Five.  What is a hoopty?  We all know that, right?  Of course.  A car that rides low to the ground, driven mainly by Dominicans.  Name the following places in New York.  Now we don't need to do that.  Washington Heights, you're on the phone.  All right.  We don't need any of this other crap.  That was informative. 
[01:57:00]  You know what we just did?  We just...  I think we just topped the fucking Martha Stewart.  We just did exactly what the Martha thing was.  And I totally got lost in it.  I'm cleaning up my area.  We completely just did the Martha Stewart thing.  And I'm like, you know what that means?  I think that means...  I'm cleaning up my area.  Yeah, we did just...  I'm going to make a pie over here now.  You're a fucking loser.  Somebody brought in the psycho stick.  Psycho...  What?  Psycho...  Where's Eric?  Let's get Eric. 
[01:57:30]  Where's E-Rock?  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock's been working on the Opie and Anthony auction the last few weeks.  Oh, I wouldn't have known he was in.  But here he is.  E-Rock.  What's up, E-Rock?  How's the Opie and Anthony auction going?  Doing very well.  And I noticed a lot of people are paying, which is a very good thing.  We just got $4,500 for intern for a day.  That's mere bag of shells to you, by the way, right?  Of course.  Mr. Cheddar, as I may call you, like Martha Stewart knows. 
[01:58:00]  Eric, what's Psycho Stick Beer?  That's something Steve brought in.  It was the number one song on Squizzle that I guess you guys talked about a long time.  Did you just say Squizzle?  Squizz.  I just liked how before he told you what it was, he blamed it on Steve.  That's not my handling.  So now if it stinks, it's Steve's problem.  The first thing he had to do was go, Steve brought that in.  Eric, do me a favor.  Go get Steve.  Okay.  All right.  There he goes.  Eric actually started walking, stopped, because Steve walked into the studio, so his music 
[01:58:30]  had to stop.  And Eric's still in the studio, and now here's Steve.  With his walk-on fucking hybrid sound effect.  Hey, Steve.  What is Psycho Stick Beer?  Eric brought it in.  Psycho Stick Beer.  Psycho Stick Beer.  Why does that sound familiar?  I'm putting it on my...  Because you brought it in to us. 
[01:59:00]  That's why it's familiar.  Well, Eric said you brought it in.  I probably did.  It's something I brought in maybe a month ago.  Some drunken haze you brought in?  No.  It has nothing to do with drunk.  I brought it probably in a course of pending like six discs, and that was one of them.  Now I can't remember what it is.  Is it a band called Psycho Stick and a song called Beer?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now I remember what it is.  That's like the number one song on Squizz.  On their...  On Squizzle?  They've got like a weekly countdown that they do, and apparently that's like the Biggins  countdown?  Yeah, the Biggins countdown.  Thank you. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, it's written on the disc.  Okay.  You know, I could have done this whole thing myself.  Yeah, there you go.  I didn't need any entry music.  I just want to hear the sound effects on the entry music.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Get out of here.  Get back to the O.P.  Anthony auction.  There you go.  Oh, it's leaving the studio at the same time.  I was very confused.  If you faded that music down, that would have sounded like that was playing in Steve's  hybrid song.  In Steve's hybrid.  Yeah.  Look at him raising his hand.  Fuck, I missed it.  Yeah, Gary Cole pissed at himself.  Missed the opportunity.  Well, we've got to play Psycho Stick and Beer.  Now we have to. 
[02:00:00]  I like beer because it is good.  I drink beer because I should.  If there was a song to sing, I sing it and beer you'd break.  I drink beer when I am sad.  Cause the beer, it makes me glad.  Now there's nothing left to say.  So let's go drink beer.  Beer is good.  Beer is good.  Beer is good.  It's not beer is good. 
[02:00:30]  Beer is good.  Beer is good.  Let's go drink some beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  I would have loved this when I was 16.  When it's warm, it tastes real crappy.  But cold beer will make me happy.  When I pull up on the floor, I can go and drink some more.  They say beer will make me dumb.  It aren't so good with pizza. 
[02:01:00]  Now that we have drunk some beer, let's go drive a car.  Beer is good.  Beer is good.  Beer is good.  It's not beer is good.  Beer is good.  Beer is good.  Let's go drink some beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer. 
[02:01:30]  Dude, I think you had enough.  Beer.  Beer.  Let's go drink some beer.  I am drunk. 
[02:02:00]  Drunk is me.  I am drunk.  Woo.  I am drunk.  Drunk is me.  I am drunk.  Woo.  Okay.  Terrific.  So that's it, huh?  That was Psycho Stick and Beer.  Number one on Squiz on the Biggins.  Wow.  Countdown.  Let's say hi to Michelle.  Hey, Michelle, what's up?  Hey.  You can't tell me that that Martha Stewart thing is the number one song since somebody in 1980 was born. 
[02:02:30]  What do you mean?  I think, did I miss the number one song?  Did you miss what?  Did I miss the number one song?  I love it.  All the OCD people are now coming out of the woodwork to call.  They need to know.  They need to know the number one song.  Oh, God.  I'm sitting in my vehicle in front of my office.  I was supposed to be there at 830, but I'm waiting on the number one song.  What do you think the number one song is?  It's coming up after the next break.  Number one song.  No.  Number one song since you've been alive.  Yellow Lead Better, but Pearl Jam. 
[02:03:00]  Very interesting.  That actually was number 92.  Oh.  It's better than that.  It's better than Britney Spears.  I know.  You would never guess the number one song.  It's going to be a big surprise.  All right.  We'll see you later.  Stay tuned.  Sweet spot.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I have a comment, and then I have a question.  All right.  My comment is that E. Rizzle is a fat gizzle for listening to Paula at Bizzle. 
[02:03:30]  But I'll do it myself.  Oh, hey.  Anyway.  The home version.  I had a question.  Billy.  Yes.  He got you.  Hung up on you.  And you know what?  You can get me 100 times in a row.  I'm a sap for all those games.  All right.  Hey, Dick Shortner from Whack Bag.  Yeah.  He's saying he works in an electronic store, and we often play walking music to piss off the  other salesmen and managers.  They have XM in the store, so they have plenty of channels to choose from. 
[02:04:00]  I guess when a manager is walking across the floor, they'll play some faggy music for  him to walk to, and it pisses him off.  I thought that was an Opie and Anthony original.  Maybe this guy got it from us.  Hoo-hoo.  We might be ripping them off.  Hoo-hoo.  All right.  Just trying to clean up my area.  Here's audio of a reporter almost saying jack off.  Jack off.  Thrilling.  Let's listen in.  Can't you say jack off on TV?  You would think you could.  All right. 
[02:04:30]  Well, here it is, I guess.  The queue's up.  Here it is.  Sask Energy is announcing a proposal to jack up the cost of heating your home by 27 to 30%.  That's hot because it's a chick.  All right.  That was worth sitting here for a month.  Was that in rubber band or was that sitting?  That was almost in rubber band.  Wow.  Good thing.  That'll clear out the rubber band section.  But look, we're clearing out stuff.  Who was sitting there smoking pot, saw that, went, this is hilarious, man.  She almost said jack off. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  I got a real good one.  Got to be on the show.  Actually, I do have a really good one.  Guy freaking out playing video game.  Oh, yeah.  I saw this clip.  The video clip.  This is really good.  Where's Steve?  Steve, you know what this clip is all about?  I can relate to this.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  I got better.  He doesn't go around the pattern anymore.  No.  Comes right in for a direct approach.  I certainly do.  Guy freaking out playing video games. 
[02:05:30]  He's playing a first-person shooter, I guess, on Xbox Live, and he's just screaming at the  top of his lungs at the game while he's playing.  Been there?  Don't really know what game it is.  Anthony might know if he saw the clip.  I don't know.  It looked like Halo.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  It might have been.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  Shut the fuck up.  Fucking get ready.  Who the fuck is driving a warthog?  Wait!  Shit!  Gosh!  What? 
[02:06:00]  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Warthog!  Shut up!  There's no one in the room with him, by the way.  Right.  You're smashing the controller. 
[02:06:30]  What the fuck?  Get out.  Double kill!  Triple kill!  Triple!  Oh, fuck you!  Oh, fuck you!  What the fuck?  Get back, get back, get back, get back, get back.  Get back, fucking war on.  Oh.  What the fuck is this?  Fuck you! 
[02:07:00]  Fuck you!  Yes!  No!  Yes!  Oh, shit!  Fuck!  I had it!  Fuck!  God!  Oh, my fucking blue screen!  Stand by, bitch! 
[02:07:30]  Fuck!  Fuck this...  For all my...  Fuck this shit!  I love it.  I lagged out!  What the...  Fuck! 
[02:08:00]  Fuck this...  Fuck!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fucking let it go, piece of...  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  Fuck!  Fucking dick!  And there you have it.  The video's up on...  Wow!  Foundry Music?  Yeah, it is.  I'll put a link to it right now.  Bravo!  Yeah, the video's even funnier.  Holy shit!  He just loses his mind and breaks all his shit. 
[02:08:30]  What else is on your website there, Steve?  Uh, you got a list.  I think we got, um...  Uh, the brutal street-beating video?  Yeah, we found that this morning it got sent in.  Uh, video's much better than the audio.  I guess it's, uh, two guys in...  Probably Los Angeles, just based on, uh, attire.  And, uh...  But this guy hits the other guy so hard that his shoes fly off.  Nice.  All right, that's up there.  Uh, the new Laszlo O&A trailer that we played earlier is up there.  That's up now.  Your listening pleasure.  We're looking for listeners to come up with their own Opie and Anthony movie trailers. 
[02:09:00]  Please, please spend more than...  All audio should be sent to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Also, uh, intern Bill's pathetic assault on the media.  The video's now up on, uh, the website.  Yeah, you can see pathetic it is.  It certainly is.  He's about 30 feet back from the, uh, camera when he does it.  It's funny, because all of a sudden you see the bag, uh, drop to the floor...  Right.  ...because he's pulling his sign out of the bag.  And then he's jumping up and down in the background, and no one cares.  It's pretty funny to watch.  Also, the assault on the media clips, uh, from the Eagles' home opener. 
[02:09:30]  That one was a really good one, and that might be in the lead for the assault on the media  contest for September.  It's between those guys and the gang from Boston that also had a great assault on the  media this month.  And we're looking for new assaults on the media, uh, as the month winds down here.  And five video clips from Jimmy's going away party.  That's right.  People have been bitching.  They're like, where the hell was the video?  Yeah, I've been moving.  I've been moving, so I haven't had a chance, but I finally got a chance to get the video  up.  Are they good video clips?  Yeah.  All right.  And that's about it for now. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you, Steve.  Okay.  Gamefly.com, Anthony.  Speaking of video games...  Ooh.  ...I met the fine folks from Gamefly.com at the Rolling Stones concert the other night.  You did.

[02:12:00]  Oh, you're on the phone.  This is a story about a man.  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, my friend, the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad, get out of here, and he says, and you know I have an angel, and he says that angel, shelter me from the falling rain. 
[02:13:00]  You have bombs, this is my life, I'm living with so much pain, shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs, this is my life, I'm living with so much pain. 
[02:13:30]  That's just a little piece.  All right, what a show, what a show, what a show.  Bill Burr in studio. 
[02:14:00]  This half-hour comedy special re-airs tonight on HBO at 11 o'clock.  I saw it last night, he kicked ass.  Absolutely.  It's really good, we're going to sit and watch it.  I love that.  Should we make pop?  I can't do it.  I want to do the voice so bad.  It's so funny.  He does his voice during this half-hour comedy special that really made me laugh hard.  Want to go to the container store?  Yeah, that's what it is.  Get some containers.  Get some t-shirts.  Oh, get some containers for your t-shirts. 
[02:14:30]  I know you're art better than you are.  You stink.  You want to go to the container store?  No, I stopped doing that shit because I don't want people lip syncing my act next time I'm out at the stress factory.  That is so funny.  You already did that.  What are you doing?  This guy's funny, but I heard this shit.  Barracuda, whackbag.com.  Hey guys, can we get an update on Opie's green apple squirts?  You want to go to brunch?  The brunch was the best.  Yeah, an update on the green apple squirts.  It was one and done. 
[02:15:00]  One and done.  A one-off.  When does that ever happen?  A prototype.  Good.  When do you ever have the liquid shits one time and one time only?  On a lucky day.  And then go right back to solid action.  Very good.  Although I went to the bathroom with Anthony later on in the show.  And I heard noises.  You walked into my stall, first of all.  Yes.  And that kind of threw me.  So I had to go all the way to the end stall.  And I'm like four stalls away.  And I just hear Opie start laughing.  And then it starts me laughing. 
[02:15:30]  It's something about the acoustics in a bathroom that just makes those noises.  It's just that hollow, echo, tile wall sound.  Fantastic.  It's like every airport I've ever been in.  Yeah.  Before you get in your flight.  Just some totally uninhibited jackass just squeezing it out.  And then they've got to go, oh.  Make that groan of pleasure.  The best is when they're talking on their cell phone while they do that.  You ever been in the airport and there's a guy on his mobile phone taking a dump? 
[02:16:00]  I was like, what are you doing?  What business is so important?  I know.  I can't lay off for a while.  I already sent those figures.  Here's some PowerPoint for you.  Slide one.  Laszlo in studio.  What's up, Laszlo?  How's it going?  Good.  I figured out your guest problem for you.  You did?  Yeah.  Because you know you guys are always saying you have trouble getting guests?  Yeah.  Well, one of the first times I was on, Ben, like a couple of days before, emailed me and  go, you're on in a couple of days, aren't you? 
[02:16:30]  I'm like, yeah.  You didn't sort of have that written down.  Oh, no.  And then two and a half weeks ago, I get an email from Ben and he says, you want to come  on the show?  In two and a half weeks?  I go, cool.  I'll do it on Tuesday, the 20th.  So last week, I get an email from him and he goes, hey, how about coming in next week  and being on the show?  I go, Ben, you got me booked?  I go, you got me booked for Tuesday.  He goes, oh, excellent.  Oh, excellent.  Guests are having to book themselves on our show.  I have one calendar with me and the other one without me. 
[02:17:00]  So it's, you know.  What are they, different?  No, I have an electronic one and then we have the one in the office.  I screwed it up.  That's great.  He's here.  Hey, he's here.  But I get nervous.  I email him the night before.  I'm like, still on, right?  Am I supposed to be on your show?  Fredo will come in and be like, you're not on your show.  I'm on the day, dude.  Laszlo?  When do you think they're going to find out in Washington that this radio show is a complete  mess?  Yeah, I have no clue what we're doing.  If anybody has a perception, this is a well-tuned machine. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Laszlo handed in a fine production piece today.  Yeah.  A fine piece.  I want to play it again.  Cool.  Yeah, I've been wanting to do like a movie trailer spoof for you guys for a while.  Because the most fun production I've ever done for GTA has always been the movie trailer  stuff.  Yeah.  Because it's just, I mean, they take forever to put together.  For anyone not familiar with Laszlo, maybe new listeners to the show, you hear his production  work in Grand Theft Auto video games. 
[02:18:00]  And his voice.  And his voice.  Yeah.  All those commercials, the wacky commercials for Glory Hole Theme Park and all that fun  stuff.  That's Laszlo.  And his sick, twisted mind.  And now you're out of a job, kind of, with GTA getting all fucked up.  Yeah.  With the porn shit, huh?  What's going on?  Are they going to be able to pump out some fun games still?  Or have they been fucked now because of the rating?  Well, there's a new game out.  I mean, they just reissued the game, from what I understand.  But, you know, from my perception, I don't work for the company. 
[02:18:30]  They just hire my production company to do stuff.  Yeah.  From my perception, it seems like there's a few politicians trying to get a little attention.  Maybe try to get that whole family values vibe.  Yeah.  It's an easy target.  No shit, Sherlock.  I mean, the Democrats are never going to beat the Republicans at the whole family values  thing.  But I don't know why, but Democrats always go after video games.  Yeah, they love hopping on the video game bandwagon. 
[02:19:00]  This is evil.  It's causing our children to...  They come up with these things that it's making children violent.  It's turning them on to guns and drugs.  And they're going to kill cops.  Let's just play that audio that we just listened to.  Yeah, that's the...  Fuck!  All right.  Ah!  Piece of shit!  Yeah, maybe they have a point.  Double point!  There's basically one guy who sort of leads it.  His name is Jack Thompson.  He's an attorney down in Florida.  And after Columbine, he sued the video game companies.  He got all these, you know, distraught parents together whose kids have been killed and said, 
[02:19:30]  I figured out the reason.  It was video games.  And they sued the video...  I mean, the video game companies had to spend millions defending this case.  And they won.  Yeah.  But...  But still cost them a lot of money.  Yeah.  Yeah, the lawyers won.  The politicians sound so out of touch when they talk about these games, too.  They don't know.  I've heard this donkey kong.  Our children are now throwing barrels at each other.  It's ape on Italian violence.  We really can't have...  Throwing barrels at goombas. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Let's listen to the Opie and Anthony movie trailer that Laszlo came up with.  In 2002, darkness covered the land.  The Catholic League is praising Infinity Broadcasting for canceling the Opie and Anthony show.  And evil reigned supreme.  Who, who, Rob Bin?  Until one day, they returned and all hell broke loose.  Bullshit!  Can you hear me?  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio. 
[02:20:30]  Shut up.  One Wednesday, I picked up a guy in a dress and he sucked my dick.  Can you just sit back and watch what happens next?  Opie.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Anthony.  Away with you.  Away.  Away.  Leave.  Leave the fucking studio.  Jim Norton.  Every one of you is a time-wasting cockteam.  I will beat children about the head.  And the O&A Army.  Our fans are a bunch of jackasses.  Three men cleaning an army from the pits of darkness. 
[02:21:00]  You are shit.  You are worthless.  We're all losing.  I could give a fuck.  Fighting the evil nemesis poisoning the land.  You're a fucking, you're just a little scumbag and I'll just spit in your fucking face.  I'd love to spit in your fucking face.  Fuck him.  And a battle that almost separated them forever.  I'm an actor.  You're insane.  You know how a show works and then you have these stupid opinions.  I understand you trying to do a radio show. 
[02:21:30]  We're not gonna do that, you ass.  Aw, don't get all angry and yell.  Jim, you're fucking pissing me off.  Whatever.  Holy shit.  What happens when love pushes you over the edge?  I gotta feel the tits.  Nowhere to run.  Who is this idiot on the radio?  Nowhere to hide.  You're shit out of luck.  And no way out.  Dance, motherfucker, dance.  Yeah, look at my cock.  The most anticipated thriller of the year.  Give to me the money I will make for you the like I fuck. 
[02:22:00]  Ah, no!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rated R for Retarded.  That is awesome, man.  That's what I did from Friday from 5 p.m. to about 2, 3 in the morning.  Bravo.  Wow, wow, wow.  And now we want listeners to try to come up with their own movie trailers.  We'll see what comes in.  You never know.  Oh, just the crap that's gonna come in.  The garbage.  I love the evil in Jim's voice.  Oh, I know.  I love to spit in your face. 
[02:22:30]  Spit in your face.  It's so calculated and nasty and comes from such a deep, dark, evil place.  Oh, it's great.  There are fun Jimmy things when he goes, shut up, I want to bite your face.  But then there's, I want to, like he's got to spell it out for you.  To spit in your face.  I just, when I put that together, I said, you know, maybe I should include the other  guys.  And I put Steve's, like, Jetson sound effect in there.  I was like, oh, this just suddenly went a different direction.  Yeah.  Pull it out.  In a Disney movie. 
[02:23:00]  Very nice.  Are you still working at K-Rock?  Yeah, supposedly.  I kind of stirred up a bit of shit over there.  Yeah.  The, um, the, the, the hoo-hoo fans have been, uh, or I guess people that are associated  with them have been sort of sabotaging the show.  Oh, really?  Which is kind of weak.  Because, you know, in radio station studios, they've got the hotline, and it's that one  number that makes all these strobe lights in the studio flash.  Uh-huh.  And the etiquette in radio is that you don't call someone while they're live and make those 
[02:23:30]  strobe lights go off.  You wait until they're in a song or they're in a commercial or something else.  Because when the hotline rings, everyone panics because it's the boss ready to yell at  you.  Right.  That's the reason he calls the number.  So.  Remember those days?  He doesn't call it to go, hey, how's your shift going?  I'm just checking in.  Well, I mean, and the other issue is I've been.  It's always something horrific.  Right.  And then you've got another three hours in your shift, and you sit there like, oh, crap.  And you're sitting there bugging.  Am I going to get fired for not playing a song on the playlist? 
[02:24:00]  And I keep waiting because I keep playing less and less music.  I'm playing about one to two songs an hour now.  And, uh, because it's, and it's all just talking.  And so the hotline rings a couple weeks ago, and everybody in the room looks at each other,  and you can't talk with, like, strobe lights going off.  Yeah.  So I answer, I bust out to commercials, and I answer the phone, and this guy goes, who's  in charge of this radio broadcast?  And I go, uh, I am.  Like, who's this?  He's like, my name's John.  I'm with the FCC.  And I'm like, really? 
[02:24:30]  And he said, uh, yeah, you need to, uh, I'm working with the commissioner of the FCC.  And, uh, you know, I'm monitoring this, uh, broadcast, uh, and you, you need to, uh, call  him.  And I said, really?  Like the FCC hotline station.  And I go, how did you get the hotline number at KROQ?  And he's like, oh, you know, because of Howard Stern, you know, we, uh, we monitor.  And, you know, I've been in radio long enough that I'm just like, what?  You know, especially since somebody that works for the FCC, some, sounds like some jackass  from Jersey that, you know, is under a car changing out carborators. 
[02:25:00]  I work for the FCC in Jersey.  He gives me, he gives me this phone number and he says, uh, yeah, you need to call the  commissioner.  I'm like, yeah, what is the commissioner's name?  Uh, and he's like, the commish.  I'm like, okay.  All right.  So, but now I guess, uh, some of Stern's boys have the hotline number.  Cause I think it's the same hotline as, as, uh, Stern's phone bank.  And I'll just be sitting there talking and the strobe lights just go off.  So it's like, I got to unhook it. 
[02:25:30]  It's really fucking annoying.  Yeah.  Time to spray paint over the, uh, strobe lights.  Yeah.  Get a Pokemon seizure during your show.  But, uh, yeah, E-Rock came on the show.  E-Rock?  A couple of weeks ago.  Oh, did he really?  Yeah.  Wow.  E-Rock came on.  Where's E-Rock?  We were talking about, uh, talking about the Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Carina.  Carina, yes.  Yeah.  You got that clip?  We played that clip on our show.  Amazing.  What, what, what could E-Rock possibly have added to your program? 
[02:26:00]  Um, well, this was pre, you know, lottery winning, so, uh.  Ah, the poor E-Rock.  Yeah.  What is he doing with that money?  Is he going to have, like, uh.  Here he is.  To his new theme music.  Wow.  He has walk-on music.  That's our new book.  Favorite artist.  He loves Paul Abdul, so that's his walk-on music.  E-Rock, you hung with Laszlo at K-Rock?  E-Rock was at K-Rock.  Hey.  No?  All right.  Go ahead. 
[02:26:30]  Wow, you were hanging out at K-Rock, huh?  Yeah, he was nice enough to invite me up to the show and, uh, plug the auction.  How was that?  It was pretty good.  Yeah?  No one knew, uh, it was you or was there anybody there?  There was nobody there except, uh, Laszlo and his, uh, his friend there.  Big Wayne.  I would assume they would probably be a little upset if the, one of the production staff  to the Opie and Anthony show were up in the K-Rock facility.  And we put some bumper stickers up.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I put some wow stickers up.  Wow stickers everywhere.  That got ripped down.  You can actually, uh, there's pictures of, of E-Rock applying stickers around the K-Rock 
[02:27:00]  studio, uh, at, uh, my website.  But, uh, we came in the next week, they were, they were ripped down.  And then I started getting harassing calls and, and like, in the next room, here's the  other thing that is insane.  I mean, I left radio.  I worked at WDRE slash WLIR out on Long Island because I got so sick of the production studios.  It was, they were so half-assed.  And the engineer there, who was like this Italian Goomba guy, was like, listen, Luzlo, you just  go behind the board and jiggle the wires. 
[02:27:30]  Because I'm like, I'm only getting like the left speaker.  Jiggle the wires in the back.  I'm like, is this a radio station?  Of course it is.  That sounds like every station I ever worked at.  But I have to record my show on cassette at that fucking, at K-Rock.  Cassette.  Cassette.  Cassette.  I, I haven't used a cassette tape in ages.  No.  And in the next room, I run a DAT backup.  And I guess there was a couple of Sterns dudes there last week and I came in and it was turned 
[02:28:00]  off and I was like, what are you doing?  Like, oh, we need the studio.  Like, I'm sort of using it.  And I'm like, it's, it's getting fucking annoying.  Yeah.  I guess you're probably not liked over there very much.  Remember what we used to do at the AAF studio?  No.  We were the ones that used to break the stuff.  What was the game we used to play?  Was it scissors?  Or a knife?  Oh, yeah.  Where we used to throw it as hard as we could into the wall?  Oh, yeah.  And sometimes we'd miss because we were way across the studio. 
[02:28:30]  And there's these things that are called monitors.  We would throw it at the wall of afros.  Yeah, we had a wall of afros.  We'd clip out pictures of afros, whether it was newspaper magazines, old, new, baseball  cars, whatever, and have this huge wall of afros.  And then we'd take scissors or knives or whatever other sharp things and throw them, I swear,  as hard as we could from across the studio into this wall.  And they'd stick, like, real deep and we'd see who we hit on the wall of afros. 
[02:29:00]  And the monitors for the studio were on the same wall.  And a couple of times, the scissor went right through the big speaker.  We were animals.  Don't we start throwing the fire extinguishers through the wall?  Then the ultimate.  Someone brought a tombstone into the studio.  It was just this huge piece of granite that had to weigh, what was it, 90 pounds?  It was, I don't know, it was ridiculously heavy. 
[02:29:30]  It was really heavy.  We took this thing and both picked it up and just rocked it back and forth.  One, two, three.  It just went right into the wall of afros and collapsing the wall of afros.  It just went right through the wall.  I don't know why we did this.  Really weird racial undertone to this whole thing.  I was going to say, this was the wall of afros.  There were as many white people on the afro wall.  It was just afros.  Yeah, the set-ups.  My picture was on the wall.  Oh, my gosh, damn wall.  The hand-lovers.  My picture was on the wall. 
[02:30:00]  We found one picture of Boston.  That was this.  Yeah.  The band Boston.  The band Boston was up there.  Yeah.  You know, and they had the big afros.  And I don't know why we used to destroy.  That seemed like a Boston scene.  Roy.  It was bad.  Throwing knives at the wall of afros.  Throwing knives or anything else, we just would destroy that studio.  Well, what about the time Green Day came in and we told them, you know, yeah, you could destroy the studio.  Oh, we do it all the time.  Go ahead, trash it.  Yeah, that took a while to clean up.  Yeah.  I don't know why we would destroy.  Like, were we angry at the time that we felt we had to rip the walls down? 
[02:30:30]  I don't know.  Like, gorillas in there.  The guy on before me at K-Rock, he goes, dude, what are you doing?  You know, keep going the way you're going.  They're probably going to blow you out.  I'm like, dude, this is something I'm doing between projects at the moment, you know?  And I guess you guys had a little bit of history with him.  Nick Carter.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  You have Nick's over there now?  Yeah, he's on, he does like a show before me or whatever.  Is he doing full-time or just?  No, he's just part-time.  I guess he used to be on.  You guys battled him up in Boston or something? 
[02:31:00]  Not really.  I mean, he was on the same time as us, but he never really.  A little smack.  Talking a little smack.  Nah, I mean, he's a friend of ours now.  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  The battle was before him, the guy before him, and then he took over, and the battle  was already won.  We butt heads a little bit, but then we were fired, so.  Much ended.  Throw him out.  You got some, uh...  Oh, there goes Ark.  All right, Ark.  Yeah, I brought him some stuff for your auction, man. 
[02:31:30]  He's just sitting there waiting for him to walk out.  And by the way, that's what he did on my show, too.  Really?  Yeah, just sort of a blank look with a mic in front of him.  Oh, that's him.  That's him.  What is he going to do with that $100,000?  Are you going to, like, some camp called Halitosis for Hope or something?  Oh, he's right there.  I don't know what he says.  He says he's going to invest it.  And live off the interest.  Live off the interest.  He told me he's going to live off the interest.  Good luck.  I don't know what stock market he's investing it in.  Yeah, hopefully it's the Colombian stock market, because they tax it. 
[02:32:00]  But from what I heard, he's got some kind of a loophole on his residence.  You can live off the interest if it was 1977, maybe.  Yeah, those days are done.  You can't live off the interest anymore.  You can't live off the interest of $70,000.  He's going to stick in his own offshore account.  Yeah, there you go.  He's going to steal it.  My brother did that.  Well, Nigeria.  Some guy emailed me from Nigeria and said that I could get $20 million if I send him my bank account number.  When I was in the airport in Switzerland, it was in Geneva, we were headed up to the French Alps.  And my buddy and I, as a joke, there's like a Swiss bank branch right there in the airport. 
[02:32:30]  And as a joke, we went up and said, hey, we want to open up a Swiss bank account.  And they said, excellent, you need $25,000 in cash.  Cash?  Sure.  I was like, wow.  Because you're not even supposed to leave with more than $10,000 in cash.  They think you're buying drugs or something.  But you can open a Swiss bank account right at the airport.  But what do you do with one?  I don't know.  Just say that you've got one.  It sounds like it would be cool to have a Swiss bank account.  Yeah, I've got a Swiss bank account.  I'm part of the Illuminati. 
[02:33:00]  What do you do?  Keep your Nazi gold there, fillings.  Do you get a debit card from them and use the ATM?  How do you get your money out?  You've got to go there again?  I think so, because a buddy of mine, his parents died.  And he found this piece of paper and found out that they had a Swiss bank account.  We actually flew over there, took a bunch of money out in cash, and then traveled around  Europe getting whacked on it.  Just strap it to your body?  Fly it back?  Just stuff it in a suitcase. 
[02:33:30]  What is it, 10 G's you're not allowed to take in?  More than $10,000 cash into the United States?  $10,000 is that.  You can't have more than $10,000 on you in cash.  Wow.  Guido from Morris Park.  Was that Laszlo's Italian accent?  It sounded more like Mickey Mouse.  Can we hear your Italian accent again?  I have no Italian accent.  Dude, I'm from Oklahoma.  It was this guy.  Hey, jiggle of the wire.  You guys were talking about...  I'm trying to chase him.  Moving along.  You guys were talking about the different slogans from countries. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  In Oklahoma, on the license plates growing up, it said, Oklahoma is okay.  Okay.  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  Just okay.  We're getting by.  We're fine.  When did Oklahoma become a country?  The country of Oklahoma.  They had slaves.  Did they?  They did.  There were slaves in the oil field.  All right.  We have some of your show stuff here.  Yeah.  On my show, there's three of us.  It's me, Big Wayne.  He's my sidekick. 
[02:34:30]  He's a former biker who used to wreck motorcycles on the BQE at 100 miles an hour and rob shoe  stores and do crack and stuff.  But he's a carpenter now.  He's one of my best friends.  We surf together every weekend.  Why shoe stores?  I'm out of curiosity.  Nikes.  Get some Nikes.  Looking cool.  Oh, stealing sneakers.  Yeah.  This is going in.  That was a big cash heist.  Steal all the size 10s.  Going to knock off a shoe store.  Where do you surf?  Long Beach.  Long Beach?  New York. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, we had some hurricane surf go through with Ophelia this weekend.  Oh, good.  It was so big.  There was a lot of people couldn't get out.  Big 10-foot, glassy faces.  Wow.  It was incredible.  Big 10-foot, glassy faces.  Nice.  You're talking shop here.  I know.  All right.  So we got some pieces from your show?  Yeah.  Wayne's had a lot of experiences with women that have been a little less than stellar.  So we play music, much like you have different theme music for people here. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Here's Romantic Moments with Big Wayne.  Romantic Moments with Big Wayne.  I was with this girl, and it was in the early 80s.  She was actually a friend of a girl that I was dating.  And we had a little relations, and she got knocked up.  And so we told her family, and everyone was all happy at first.  And a couple weeks went by, and the father kind of grabbed me and said,  You know, these guys are kind of young, and you don't know what direction your life's going into. 
[02:36:00]  And take her to the clinic.  And then I took her to a place on Fifth Avenue and 60th Street.  After the procedure, we got back to her house.  You know, there was moments of, Oh, you aren't going to love me anymore.  And da-da-da.  We're not going to last.  We're not going to be together.  And, you know, it turned into another moment.  And little to say, three weeks later, I was back in Fifth Avenue and 60th Street for the Ram 2.  Oh, my God.  We were in the house.  Control his instincts.  Romantic Moments with Big Wayne. 
[02:36:30]  Holy shit.  Wow, the music really sets that pace.  It is so...  I'm bringing it all together.  Thank God I'm in delay on that station, because I have to keep hitting the goddamn dump button.  Because, I mean, he's a carpenter.  Every other word's fuck, shit.  It's killing me.  Goddamn.  She just had an abortion and was able to have sex again.  He took the chick home and fucked her again and got her pregnant again.  I like how the whole thing went, though, where she felt that he wouldn't love her because of the abortion. 
[02:37:00]  And that turned into romance and him showing that he loved her by having sex.  And then she gets pregnant again.  Wow.  There was no guilt or shame in that one.  No, none.  None.  You've got to see this guy.  He's about 240 pounds.  He's got a dreadlocked beard down to his waist.  He's a piece of work.  That's all right.  That's great.  He might be perfect for this fine channel of ours.  It's a good one.  All right.  Romantic Moments with Big Wayne, number two here.  Yeah, there's another one on there. 
[02:37:30]  Romantic Moments with Big Wayne.  Chick's name was Debbie.  Her brother's name was Mooney, who we really hung out with.  And she was born with a disfigured arm.  And at the elbow joint, it had a little hand that never grew past a five-year-old's hand.  When I met it, it was actually a baby hand.  And then it grew to be like a little child's hand.  And she always kept it coming up.  And I had a fantasy of that, you know, I'd like to be released by hand from the mini hand.  And not being that well-endowed, I might feel humongous. 
[02:38:00]  Romantic Moments with Big Wayne.  Yeah, I like that bit a lot, man.  Yeah, like a thalidomide hand, a little thing on the end of your elbow.  Oh, wow.  I like that guy.  He just talks about unbelievably disgusting shit, but he does it with such a bouncy kind of voice.  Yeah, he's shuffling through it.  I think he goes up at the end of the sentence.  Yeah.  And it grew into kind of a little kid's hand.  Little hand.  Oh, and those are the tame ones. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Like, there's stuff that I can't even put on K-Rock just because you can't say fart, for God's sakes, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Regular radio.  Stinks.  Here's the show opener for week seven, show number six.  Yeah.  Is it worth playing or?  Yeah, sure, man.  Well, we'd love your production, so.  Who's at risk and how prepared are we?  Are we next in America?  How safe are we in America?  Can we prevent a subway or bus attack in the U.S.?  This is why I thought the Brit should have let the French have the Olympics. 
[02:39:00]  Why are they doing this?  You have to wonder, will we ever truly feel safe again?  There's a lot to worry about in America today.  Terrorism, the economy, gay marriage.  But when the anxiety sets in, I turn off the TV, pull up a chair, hop a Percocet, and a nice cold Brooklyn lager, and I turn on the Laszlo Show.  Stand by, baby.  It's starting right now.  Please, stand by. 
[02:39:30]  Should we start with the national anthem?  You know what?  Ah, screw it.  I got too drunk last night.  Just, uh, play the opening music.  And this is where I start talking.  The kid's hysterical always.  Love the kid.  I get emails from, uh, from ONA fans.  Tell me more about the kid.  Like, he's a pedophile.  Yeah, that's frightening.  Dude, I got this email from some, one of your fans.  He's like, hey, there's, you know, they're talking about you on Whack Bag. 
[02:40:00]  And I was like, oh, okay.  And so I went to Google, and there's this Google search you can do where you can sort of like spider through a site by typing, like, Laszlo, site, and then Whack Bag.  And I'll show you every instance that your name is mentioned on that site.  Wow.  And, you know, I'd heard Jay Moore one time talking about the pit of despair that he got sucked into, going on Whack Bag.  And I was like, eh, it'll be different for me.  Oh, no.  Dude, two hours later, I was like, oh, my God. 
[02:40:30]  Which is why I got the idea for that movie trailer, because I was watching, like, Lord of the Rings, and, you know, like all those orcs, armies coming.  I was like, that's what the fucking ONA army looks like.  That's what they're like.  And they can turn on you the drop of a dime.  They will just turn on you.  There was this one thread.  I was like, what does Laszlo look like?  And I'd never had any pictures of me at my website.  You know, I'd always just, like, kept low key or whatever.  And somebody found a picture of this fat guy in Birkenstocks with a goatee. 
[02:41:00]  And they're like, this is what he looks like.  And so this thread explodes.  Oh, he looks like a fag.  And I'm sitting there waiting to go, no.  You will never find a larger collection of guys who are more concerned about how guys look than in radio.  I swear to you, I have had, throughout my entire life, I've had no problem getting and keeping girls and girlfriends. 
[02:41:30]  Never been an issue in my life.  And that, to me, is all I need.  When Mitch will email and talk about how ugly I am, I'll be like, why does Mitch, first of all, care about what I look like?  And how can he really, like, judge?  And how is he sitting there going, I don't find Anthony attractive?  It just, it dumbfounds me.  You're not going to fuck him. 
[02:42:00]  He's just there to make you laugh.  Right.  Calm down.  I'm there to talk into a microphone.  You don't even need a visual.  It's radio.  This isn't TV.  You went out of your way to see what I look like, to then comment on it.  Our looks will never get in your way.  It's always.  It's not a TV show.  And it's always guys.  Yeah.  It's always guys.  And there's this thread on there.  They start talking about, yeah, I really like his stuff from Grand Theft Auto, ba-da-da-da-da.  And this one guy puts in there, yeah, Grand Theft Auto stuff.  He was ripping off Stern.  Well, you were. 
[02:42:30]  Because you spoke into a microphone.  Right.  To do it, right?  Hoo-hoo right there.  You're ripping off Stern on the Grand Theft Auto.  What are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  I probably heard Stern like two or three times when we were writing the scripts for that.  Yeah.  The first game.  There were just, there are just some people that are so brainwashed that anybody, a sound  coming out of a speaker, there you go.  You're ripping them off.  All right.  It doesn't matter.  Hey, this just in. 
[02:43:00]  Gene Simmons is MIA?  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  What a shame.  He's got some hair on him.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  The show always starts with potential.  We sometimes have guests that actually look like somebody on this sheet.  Sometimes they actually show up.  Sometimes they actually call in.  All right.  Anything else on this, Laz?  Yeah, there's, Jaguar Skills is this weekly radio serial that we've been doing.  We're really into comic books and stuff like that, and I thought, you know, the radio serial 
[02:43:30]  is very much dead.  So I got contacted by this DJ in England, and he and I actually collaborated on this album,  and his name's Jaguar Skills.  So we've been making these, like, 1970s action adventure episodes.  Ovi, could you imagine preparing for a show like this?  Could you imagine corresponding and collaborating with someone in another country for a break  on the show?  Can you imagine Anthony staying for longer than five seconds after the show? 
[02:44:00]  After the show is over?  I start to walk over across the room to shake your hand and say, great show, and there's  this wisp of smoke, and he, like, appears on Long Island seconds later.  The elevator is in free fall to get me out quicker.  I just pull a handle, and it drops.  I can't get out of here quickly enough.  And he's on the phone with England.  Yeah, I think they, uh, I got a great idea.  Unbelievable, the dedication.  We're actually, we've played a few of these, and we're talking to an animation house about 
[02:44:30]  possibly turning it into a cartoon.  Some guys that do some stuff for Adult Swim.  Will this make sense?  Who knows?  No, let's take a listen.  If not, what the hell.  If not, it still kills two minutes today.  Oh.  My name is DJ Jaguar Skills.  Secret ninja powers are revealed to me when I hold aloft my magic stick.  Jaguar.  Jaguar.  Jaguar.  Jaguar Skills.  With my fly ebony honey at my side. 
[02:45:00]  And my friends, the mighty Fat Boss crew at my back.  I battle evil.  Jaguar Skills.  The funkiest ninja in the universe.  Jaguar Skills.  Tonight, we join our hero, Jaguar Skills, the UK's flyest ninja DJ, deep into a session  of lady pleasing.  Uh-uh.  Don't tell me that was it.  Yo, that's super speed, baby. 
[02:45:30]  That's DJ ninja style.  I'm in an hour before you even know it.  You got that right, fool.  Look, shut your stupid face before I chop your head off with a sword, yeah?  Damn.  It's the Chuck D alarm.  Damn.  Throw me my magic stick and my ninja knickers.  Shortly after meeting up with his sidekick, Tiger Chan, and the mighty Fat Boss crew.  Jag, yo.  It's your evil nemesis, DJ Nuptial.  The wackest wedding DJ in all of Britain.  Oh, man.  I hate that fool.  Yeah, he and his evil ninja crew, they've taken this club and everyone inside hostage. 
[02:46:00]  They're about to unleash some romantic ballads and Hasselhoff and all kinds of shit.  Look, it's time to get grey-white on these fools and burn this place down.  What about the children?  Tiger, we're going to have to go around the corner and rape all the women and children.  Jaguar, what are you talking about?  Jaguar, your eyes are red.  Have you been smoking hash all day?  Totally mashed.  I'm massively mashed.  Look, do you know how mashed I am?  I'm massively mashed.  Jag, I'm going to have to take you back to the hideout.  You are bugging out. 
[02:46:30]  I think it's time to go back to the hideout and smoke some Hass.  Join us next time for another Jaguar Skills adventure.  Jaguar Skills.  Hop, hop, hop.  Jaguar Skills.  Five gorgeous young ninja bits protecting Earth's entire galaxy.  Always five.  Acting as one.  Dedicated.  Inseparable.  Invincible.  Hop.  Wow.  That's some production, man.  That's too much like the real deal.  The stories really never go anywhere, and it's really based after this guy's real character. 
[02:47:00]  He's like a black belt that sits around and smokes hash all day at this, like, mountaintop  villa in Spain.  He's a weird dude, so I was like, I've got to create a cartoon about you, dude.  Wow.  Very good.  Very, very good.  He's calling people in England.  I know.  You're making us look bad.  Opie reads a magazine, and he's, like, crowing.  I read a magazine last night, and I got something here. 
[02:47:30]  He's, like, on the phone with England.  Well, what did you bring to the show today?  Clipping out the articles like an old lady with coupons.  What did you bring to the show today?  I wasn't saying.  I read Giant Magazine.  I wasn't saying that I did more than you.  All right.  I'm saying Laszlo is blowing everyone away.  A positive attitude.  That's it.  And isn't that all you really need?  What a bit of love.  We were patting ourselves on the back 45 minutes into this bullshit today.  We're going to take a break. 
[02:48:00]  I guess Gene Simmons is not calling the show today?  Of course not.  I'm sure people are just sitting around waiting for Gene to call the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And who's Julia?  What is she?  She's going to talk about sex.  She's from, hold on, hold on.  Who is still?  Co-ed Magazine.  Oh, and I see Super Agent Robert Eatman.  This could delay my exit by the tens of minutes. 
[02:48:30]  I haven't even met him yet, and he's now my agent.  Is he?  Yes.  Wow.  He's everyone's agent.  I know.  After the headlines we got.  I'm going to be doing overnights in Paducah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Talk to him now, because you'll never get him on the phone.  He's everyone's agent.  Can you get the Opie and Anthony deal for me?  Well, yes I can.  All right.  I'll sign with you.  Who suffers in the end?  Opie and Anthony.  Oh!  His stable of more than 10,000 hacks. 
[02:49:00]  He's got 10,000 morning hacks.  10,000.  And one.  And one now.  Thank you.  And Anthony and I.  Yeah, we used to be like the big guys.  I don't want to bet he watches Entourage.  You think?  Look at his dress is different.  Yeah, what is it?  He's looking a little more casual.  You watch Entourage.  Is that what it is?  He wants to be, what's his name there?  He's wearing like a.  He's dressing like Ari.  Look at him.  I usually see him in a suit.  He's from Chicago.  All of a sudden he's dressing like Ari.  Wearing like a yellow button-down shirt, kind of open at the collar, all sexy. 
[02:49:30]  Have you ever seen him dress like that?  No, never.  I think he got influenced by Entourage.  He wants to be Ari.  He is.  He's a day away from getting the gold hoop earring.  Ari making it cool to be a super agent nowadays.  Probably had a flesh-toned t-shirt during Miami Vice days.  Is he representing anyone from Entourage, perhaps?  Maybe that's the deal.  Oh, don't talk about it.  I'm in negotiation.  Love the Bob. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  And I forgot to tell you, Anthony, our old GM called yesterday.  Brucey Mittman.  Bruce Mittman.  Boys, is he going to be in town and want to have dinner?  I have no idea.  I didn't call him back.  Again, another boar-fest dinner with Robert.  I was going to say with Robert Eatman, but that's true, too.  But with Brucey Mittman?  Who knows?  We'll have to call him back.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah, I got to take a leak.  Bill Burr sitting in today.  Laszlo sitting in today.  And we got, what's her name?  Julia from Co-Ed Magazine to talk about sex next. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, we knocked off.  Sweet oral pleasure.  Such a talented little heroin addict.  Oh, dear.  Overdose.  Ramon.  Get the wood chipper.  Ah, just when you thought the show couldn't get any more exciting, entering the studio 
[02:51:00]  is Julia from Co-Ed Magazine.  Yeah.  A magazine no one has ever read.  Hey.  People have read it.  I use too much Purell.  Wow.  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hello.  Whoa.  Look at this. 
[02:51:30]  Hello.  How are you, Tyson?  You've got confidence in your walk and everything.  I like it.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I've been a dating columnist for like four years, so it does get you...  A dating columnist, huh?  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  Hey, we have our own dating columnist.  His name is Patrice.  Patrice O'Neal.  This could be a good time to run this by a professional.  Do they have headphones go with my outfit or...  It's a little red.  Yeah, that's fine.  That looks perfect.  Don't worry about it.  Now look, now we all clam up and get intimidated. 
[02:52:00]  I'm looking at a different set of cans.  An attractive girl in the studio.  I'm going to warn you right now, when it comes to a girl with like a brain, we stink.  Ooh, you guys are in trouble for today then.  Yeah.  We really do stink.  Well, I need me to do that.  Any woman shows intelligence in this studio, we all just fall apart in front of us.  You're like under the table.  That's Bill.  Bill?  Yes.  Yeah.  How are you?  That's Laszlo.  Laszlo.  Is that your first or last name?  One.  Nickname?  One name.  It's like Madonna.  Laszlo.  Madonna.  You could be huge with that name. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Like Laszlo.  You could have a whole cult.  Laszlo.  That's Opie again.  Hello.  Just one name.  And you must be.  And Anthony.  One name.  You don't go by A?  No.  No, we have the big A.  No.  And that's Fan.  Hi, Fan.  Hi.  Doesn't have the worst name.  You thought Opie was bad, but Fan.  Fan, no.  It's sort of like Thor, but.  It's short for Nathaniel.  Oh, very creative.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Six ticket.  Awful.  At least your parents didn't name you Peaches or something like that. 
[02:53:00]  There's a star kid named Peaches.  Oh, yeah?  She's not into it.  Star teen.  I don't know why I follow this kind of stuff.  Peaches who, though?  Apple?  No.  Kid named Apple.  It's like, you know, she's actually in Britain as well.  Yeah.  She's British.  Now, you're a dating expert.  I am.  Now, how did you get to be an expert?  You must have gone out on a lot of dates.  I did.  I have.  You did.  Yeah, it's true.  How old a gal are you?  You're young enough to ask that without.  Now, what do you think?  Can you guess?  I'd go with like 31, 43. 
[02:53:30]  She's very clever.  You know how to woo a woman.  I understand that.  That is awful.  I would say.  No, she's beautiful.  I don't know.  25.  Younger than 25?  Yes.  But you've been doing this a while.  You know why?  You're holding yourself as a mature woman.  24.  I know you're really up.  You're 24.  You freaked out when you said 25.  When's your birthday?  It's a huge February.  All right.  So, I'm a half a year off. 
[02:54:00]  It's a very important half a year.  Yeah, it is.  24 to 25.  But you've been doing this for five years.  Well, I started doing it in college.  You know, I was at Georgetown.  Oh, okay.  And I started writing the column after I took a year off and I worked on Capitol Hill.  And you know, the ratio of unattractive men to attractive women in D.C. is ridiculous.  Really?  I mean, if you're even remotely good looking, you can get any man there.  So, it was a...  Wait, who's the ugly one then?  The guys?  Yeah, the guys were the ugly ones.  But they got the power, right?  They do.  Power is an aphrodisiac.  Because it's politics. 
[02:54:30]  Now, what's the difference between being a dating expert and just a slut with a pen?  Because you would think you would have to be with a lot of people to be an expert in the  whole dating thing.  I'm a big reader.  I don't know.  You know, I think actually the difference is that dating experts have methodologies and  sluts with pens just sort of go with it.  Right.  Probably with alcohol involved.  Yeah?  You know, I only involved alcohol when absolutely necessary. 
[02:55:00]  Did you ever bang a senator?  Congressman, actually.  A congressman?  There's a big difference.  Senators are really hard to bag.  And they're quite...  Is that when you hit expert status?  Yeah.  That was...  I said, check, you know.  No, I dated a congressman for a while.  Really?  Yeah, that was sort of...  How old was he?  I was 32.  He was young.  Wow.  And he was single.  Can you believe it?  No.  Any congressional sex, like in his actual office, or...  No, no, no. 
[02:55:30]  Never in his office.  No.  I'm not going to tell you where, though.  They're like, oh my God.  That private subway to the Capitol?  Yeah, you know, I think it's a little bit of a cliche, but I'm sure that there are some  people out there who get off on that, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know there are people who love doing it in their office, but I've never done that.  But you guys would love that public sex, right?  How about the waiting room outside the office?  I've been outside his office before.  And I used to work in a congressional office.  Now, these are not the same people, of course.  Now, you're right about all this, the magazine. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  You're right about your dating experiences.  Yeah, I started out...  How graphic does it get?  Well, at my Catholic university, Georgetown, not very.  It took me a lot of time to convince them that they should use the word sex.  I said, listen, it's not, you know, we're not describing the act.  They said, well, you know, you're not married.  You shouldn't be having sex.  And I said, yeah, you should tell that to the rest of the students here, because they  didn't get the memo.  You're having a whoopee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, actually, they asked me to say making out, you know, making love. 
[02:56:30]  Heavy petting.  I love heavy petting.  I was like, these frat guys are not making love.  Let me tell you, you know.  So that was in college.  I was in college.  And then I started writing for co-ed, which is coedmagazine.com.  You can check it out.  Yeah.  Now, this has nothing to do with the Catholic religion, so you can be a little more aggressive.  Yeah, my picture's in college.  Did you tell them?  Where is it?  No, I mean on the website, so our fans could, you know, check you out.  I don't know.  And if it's not, someone over a coed should.  Here's my college.  I just thumbed past Jeffrey Ross's picture. 
[02:57:00]  What the hell happened there?  Oh, there you are.  Catholic school girl outfit.  There you are.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  Oh, wait.  We don't have to look at a picture of you.  You're in studio.  I am.  I'm right here.  Seymour Cleveland right here.  So now you start writing for a coed.  I start writing for coed after I graduate from Georgetown, and coed is a new collegiate  magazine that is, at every college, it covers everything college, you know, the best stuff  frat parties, it profiles four schools in every issue, hot women, but it's technology, 
[02:57:30]  fashion, et cetera.  It's written by a lot of college students.  Now, can you get graphic in there?  I get a little more graphic.  I just want to know how far it goes.  Is it more about dating, or do you kind of get in-depth on your sexual experience with  the person you're with?  Well, my last column was about cheating.  Any of you guys ever cheated?  Want to talk about it?  Never.  No.  Oh, no.  Why would you do that?  I'm sitting at a table with a bunch of angels.  I can just sense it.  Yeah, that's right.  I don't believe any of you.  Except for him.  Everyone's cheated, please. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  How about the walk of shame?  My smile's cheated.  The walk of shame.  You ever write an article about the walk of shame?  I have.  Yes.  I love the walk of shame.  Now, did you know that prior to this?  That's my next column.  Is it?  Oh, really?  The walk of shame is classic.  I'm an expert.  I'm an expert on the walk of shame.  You're like missing a shoe.  I do it like every morning, let me tell you.  Really?  Yeah.  Almost every morning.  You do the walk of shame yourself?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You should explain what the walk of shame is.  Oh, the walk of shame.  Let's see.  If you get up early on a Sunday to go get bagels, you see a lot of people walking home. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, my God.  You know, I was up.  You get to see the best sights.  Exactly.  Just going to get the paper and some bagels.  The walk of shame is happening all around you.  Hair's all fucked up.  Right.  No, I was up at 7.30.  Holding on one high-heel shoe.  You wonder where the other one is.  No, no one dresses in a mini skirt on a Sunday morning unless they're coming from a little bit of a good time.  Usually, you can call it.  They've got jizz in their hair.  Big load in their head.  Right.  I'm not even kidding, man.  All over their shirt.  This is the worst.  You want to see some horror shows?  Just get up early on a Sunday. 
[02:59:00]  Torn blouse, look of confusion.  Bring a digital camera on.  It's classic.  Yeah.  That happens with you a lot.  Not, well, it happened, well, let me explain.  I have currently a boyfriend right now, and so his house is obviously separate from mine,  and I usually sit over at his, so every morning, walk of shame.  Why is that the walk of shame, though?  Well, any time you hook up with someone.  The walk of shame is like when you're just doing the one-night stand and then have to walk home to your frat house.  No, not necessarily.  The frat house, or?  Yes, usually.  In college, definitely. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I mean, and it's usually, it's something where you're wearing, you know, your hoochie outfit from the night before.  You're hungover as all hell, and you look like crap.  Usually, there are priests up at that hour, and they're, like, crossing themselves, like, dear God,  and you've kind of stuck to your, you know, skirt or something.  I was on vacation in North Carolina, and we were driving home on the highway,  and I saw a girl doing the walk of shame on a major highway.  That's awful.  That's a good one.  And you're wondering.  You're sure she wasn't a rape victim? 
[03:00:00]  Maybe you should have stopped, Toby.  Look at that whore.  You know, she needs medical attention.  Staggering out of a rest area.  Hey.  Slut.  It was just very obvious.  Well, you guys have, have you guys done the walk of shame?  I mean, guys do it, too.  No, no.  No, you take them back to your place, and you kick them out the next morning.  It's the proud walk of the cock.  That's what you do.  Yeah.  When do you kick them out?  7 a.m.?  8?  You let them stay until 10, maybe?  4 a.m.?  It depends on how disgusted I am with them at the time.  Jesus Christ.  Usually, about two minutes afterward, I'm ready. 
[03:00:30]  Depends on how big your beer goggles were the night before, right?  One of them stayed for nine years.  That was my concern.  Fuck.  She's getting half the page like everything when she finally did leave.  She got a U-Haul truck.  You haul truck and a Swiss bank account.  Listen, you're a sex columnist.  I have a question that I've been wondering about.  Ask me.  What is it about not showering for five or six days and being covered in feces that makes  you want to rape somebody?  Who are you referring to?  I'm talking about the Superdome, because I don't know what it was about. 
[03:01:00]  I mean, what is sexual and turns you on about a bunch of people piled into some kind of Mad  Max movie covered in their own shit?  No, no, no.  But you have to understand, rape is not about sex.  It's sexuality.  It's about violence.  Don't you know about Laszlo?  It's a violence.  It's violent.  It's a romance.  It's violent.  Not about romance.  No, no, no.  Oh, it's not?  It's about having a strong opinion.  No, no, no.  It's about teaching them a lesson.  No, because, you know, rape is definitely not... 
[03:01:30]  It's not guys get so turned on they have to rape someone.  No, no.  That's not how it works.  No.  It's just guys who just cannot control their violent instincts.  But wouldn't you have to be a rapist to really know?  I don't know, but I think they've done a lot of sociological, psychological studies on that.  Yeah, but if you're a rapist, are you really going to be answering these questions honestly?  I mean, you're really just morally devoid of any sort of...  And I think lying isn't very bad.  I'm not really sure how we got on the subject of...  How did we get here?  I think when the world... 
[03:02:00]  Oh, Laszlo.  I think when the world is...  Laszlo wants to get serious on it.  When the world is coming to an end, there's something in the evolutionary part of your brain that says it is time to start banging.  Copulating.  After 9-11, nine months after 9-11, there was a ton of births.  Yeah.  Because people are like the world's ending...  I think those are totally different things.  I think that the Superdome was really more of an exercise in absolute desperation.  I think it's just when you think the world's coming to an end, it's time to start banging.  So, does that mean that you don't do that before?  How is your sex life right now? 
[03:02:30]  All right.  Here's a question we need answered.  We've got to ask you questions that everybody, all the guys in the audience are going to need to know.  That's right.  How do you know when the guy is going to be able to fuck you?  How do I know...  Yeah, how do you know?  You go out on a date...  When he's going to be able to?  When he's...  After he's taken his Viagra?  No, no, no.  Like you go out on a date.  You go out on a date.  He's wondering if he's going to get some that night.  Oh, God.  You know immediately.  You know immediately.  Yeah, but you've got to make them wait for it.  You want it.  Damn these bitches.  Oh, I'm telling you. 
[03:03:00]  No, the more that you make them wait, the better it is for you, the woman.  Yeah?  Because after they've gotten it, it's like, okay, been there, done that.  Your power's gone.  Your power.  Exactly.  You have no more power.  No, it's really an unfortunate fact of life.  You're tied up in your golden lasso.  No, make them wait.  And by the way, the more the girl likes to...  He's stealing your invisible jet.  Shit, it's over.  I don't know, really.  Fuck you, lady.  That's not always true.  I'm sure you've had a lot of dating experience. 
[03:03:30]  Aren't there guys that are, you know, stand-up guys?  They have the sex and then, you know, hang out, still treat you well, still take care of you.  Oh, yeah.  I've dated a lot of them.  Things like that.  But I'm telling you, it's better if you make them wait.  It's just better for everyone, by the way.  No, not for everyone.  There's one person that would say no, the guy that's waiting.  No, but you know what?  Guys do want you to make them wait, unless they're thinking of you as a one-night stand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know something?  You're speaking for rapists.  You're speaking for men.  You're not in any of these categories.  Guys would want you to make them wait if they know there's going to be the payoff. 
[03:04:00]  The thing is, you don't know if there's going to be the payoff.  But there's something very sweet about the anticipation.  Yeah, all the movies and the dinners.  Yeah, I know, all the money that you have to pay out in the interim.  Yeah, right.  Money is no object.  Just ask Hawk.  Where's Hawk?  He knows.  He just won $100,000.  Big spender.  He just won $100,000.  $100,000.  $100,000 large.  $100,000.  He's going to be out on the town.  You can see him picking up some broads. 
[03:04:30]  Well, we'll see.  Let's ask him a few broads here.  What do you think of this guy right here?  Here he comes.  Hawk.  Look at him.  How did you win $100,000?  I'm not aware.  Oh, very skillful.  Oh, yeah?  Very skillful.  Yeah, poker.  Selling your body on the streets?  No, that's it.  He mailed something into the daily news.  Like an old woman.  Yeah.  Like an old wash woman.  Actually, it was all old women and Eric that won.  Yeah, old women and Eric won.  He was in a laundromat when he killed it out.  What lucky lady are you going to take out?  What are you going to do for your woman? 
[03:05:00]  Do you have a woman?  Yeah.  I do.  Multiple women?  No, just one.  Just one woman?  Just one.  How long have you been with her?  Several months now.  Oh, and so what are you going to get her?  I don't know yet.  Yeah, she's going to.  I'm going to take her shopping when she comes out here.  Is she like a high maintenance?  I mean, I say high maintenance in the best possible way.  Is she like shopping or, you know, what's her deal?  No, she's very low maintenance, but when she comes in, I'm going to take her shopping.  Oh.  Where?  She wants to go to Tiffany's, so.  Oh, yeah.  Let me tell you something about Tiffany's. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Good luck.  A hundred grand and go real quick.  There's shit there, I know.  No, no.  Let me tell you.  You will get a very good night of loving after that.  His money's going to be done in a weekend.  You're totally getting fucked.  Don't go to Tiffany's.  You can spend $100 on a whore and get the exact thing you want.  That was the best.  That is propaganda.  God, that's when I wish this was television.  That's when I.  She goes, you're going to get a good night of loving for that.  And then Bill's face is.  He threw his arms up and looked around like, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  That's that Oprah propaganda. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Hawk is looking for love, not just sex.  This is going to be.  She's speaking for somebody else.  I can tell.  This is a matter.  Sweet face.  The rapist.  All right.  Let me speak for you.  Julia, would you go out with him?  Sure.  Oh.  Without the money?  No.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  No, no.  If I didn't have a boyfriend, yeah.  Oh, if I didn't have a boyfriend.  That's a great excuse, isn't it?  You wouldn't go out with him.  Be honest.  Not at all.  He's a good guy to speak with.  I would. 
[03:06:30]  Why would you go out with him?  Exactly.  Because I think that you should give everyone a chance.  He could be amazing in bed.  Who knows?  Oh, come on.  Jesus.  You heard $100,000 and your eyes poked.  Nah, $100,000 is not going to impress me at this point.  Yeah, $100,000 is nothing.  No, I'm really happy for you.  I would love $100,000.  So, you know, you want to donate.  Why would you go out with him?  Because I think he could be interesting.  Why?  He's a zero.  Everyone.  No, no.  That's not nice.  Liar, whore, liar, whore.  You know it. 
[03:07:00]  Who's that guy?  You guys just put that on every now and again?  Yeah.  No, you give everyone a chance.  That's the problem with women right now is they are too picky.  You have to go out and see what the guy is like.  You know, there could be a Casanova underneath his polo shirt.  I'm calling Bravo Sierra.  Oh!  Easy with the language, Opie.  Bravo Sierra.  You're just trying to be nice and stuff.  Well, professionally, you'd go out with him.  Yeah, on the radio.  On the radio.  See, professionally.  And then she'd write about it.  And, you know, words like dork and shit would be filling up. 
[03:07:30]  I love dorks.  I love them.  Do you?  Yeah.  I don't go for the Brad Pitt type.  I go for the Zach Braff type.  Really?  You and I are out.  Have a huge thing for him.  Dorks are easily manipulated.  Easy prey.  Look at the bitter, Bill.  You are just so like, yes, they easily manipulate.  I've got to do something.  Listen, let me say.  I've got to, you know, I'm playing devil's advocate.  Of course.  He's trying.  All I want is a guy who's going to talk string theory.  Bill's had some recent problems.  That's all we're going to say right now.  Uh-huh.  Okay. 
[03:08:00]  Recent problems.  So he's a little bitter right now.  What are you bitter about?  I'm not bitter.  It's not working correctly?  Or what?  What isn't working?  Oh, I was like, oh.  I think if you, if you want somebody.  Fucking hack.  It's not what you guys, how you use it.  I think if you want somebody that is going to speak string theory,  maybe it's Stephen Hawking and not Hawk.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm not sure how.  That's hot.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, very clever, Laszlo.  You're redeeming yourself.  I worked on that all night. 
[03:08:30]  Do you have...  I'm going to cock block him.  Crash everything you say.  Do you have sex on the first date?  No.  Why not?  No?  Ever?  Never?  Well...  Ah, one time.  Yeah, I've done it once, yeah.  Yeah?  It led to a year-long relationship, if you can believe it, with a crazy person.  But, yeah, no, I don't recommend that.  It's not a good idea.  Yeah.  How old were you when you first started, um...  Effing.  Effing?  I was going to start with dating.  Oh.  I was going to start with dating.  My first date, my first kiss was at 14. 
[03:09:00]  Aw.  That's adorable.  Well, okay, when was the first time...  When did you guys lose your virginity?  Let's hear it.  13.  Yeah, you're lying.  No, no, it was 13.  Really?  Yeah.  His father got him a whore.  She was 19.  No, it wasn't a whore.  It was too a whore.  She was a friend of the family.  Yeah.  She was 19.  Her name was Buzz.  And my father and his wife went out that night, and Buzz was over the house.  We were watching Monty Python's Flying Circus. 
[03:09:30]  She told me to go into the shower, so I didn't know.  I just went in, and I came out, and she was in the bed.  Hawk is leaving.  See you later, Hawk.  She was in the bed, and as I was walking out of the shower to my bedroom, I heard,  Aren't you coming in?  And it went like, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  This is it.  How did you even know what to do at 13?  I had been reading a lot of magazines and jerking it like a rabbit.  Really?  It was a monkey.  What am I saying?  A rabbit?  Yeah, hump like a rabbit.  Anytime.  If you find a rabbit jerking off, please call me. 
[03:10:00]  Two little paws.  Yeah, they don't even have thumbs.  God.  What a rabbit jerking off.  He's reading Watership Down, jacking off.  He's sitting up using those big back legs.  Yeah, in the briar patch.  I think 13 is shockingly young.  Opie, how old were you?  18.  Freshman in college.  That's more appropriate.  Thank you.  Appropriate.  Now she's speaking for everybody that lost their virginity.  Yeah.  You were inappropriate.  You think that's appropriate, though?  You were inappropriate.  I was inappropriate.  It probably was inappropriate.  You were baby.  It was pretty good. 
[03:10:30]  I'd been jerking, though, for years.  Oh, for years.  What, since you were seven?  Well, no.  You're like eight.  Probably like 11.  God.  Or something.  Oh, my God.  I think I was still reading The Babysitter's Club at 11.  Yeah.  My God.  So was I.  I thought I was jerking, too.  Remember that back in the day?  It's just like a Jordan Marsh catalog would turn you on.  You're like, oh, my God.  I see a calf.  Where are you?  The dick is standing up.  Women in those bloomers that came up to the middle of their abdomen and their kneecaps.  The bra ads.  Yeah.  The Sears catalog.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Airbrushing out any bit of their sexuality.  So your tolerance is a lot higher now.  Yeah.  Well, it's also pre-internet, pre-Victoria.  Yeah.  Secret.  Seven-year-olds nowadays.  You needed everything.  You needed anything worked back then.  But your first kiss at 14.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was very good.  It was like every year.  You took all the steps, the appropriate steps.  I'm very organized.  Yeah.  So I was organized in my love life as well.  So then I will guess you lost your virginity at 17.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:11:30]  I was just running through that.  A base a year.  If you kiss at 14, you're fucking by 17.  When did you lose the back door?  Oh, Jesus.  This is so big.  And what base is that?  That we're not going to talk about.  What base is that?  It's like five and a half.  Come on.  Wow.  That's out of the baseline.  When should the ladies give up the back door?  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe you're married.  My God.  Married.  You know what?  You know what?  I don't have any judgments.  If you want to do whatever you want to do.  I had a girl actually say that.  Really?  She actually said, like, I have to save something for my husband. 
[03:12:00]  For marriage.  What if your husband don't want that?  I don't know.  I mean, do you guys seriously want it?  That treasure.  I'm saving this prize for my husband.  No, no, thank you.  I don't really think it's that hot, to be honest.  No?  No.  No, yeah.  Wait, what?  Visualizations of what else that's used for.  She didn't save it?  No.  You whittled her down?  You got her down?  Yeah.  She loved it.  It was one night.  She starts out at the prize waiting for her husband.  No, no, no.  And it's like, nah, I'll toss it to Bill Burr. 
[03:12:30]  Nah, nah, nah.  A couple tequila shots later.  Yeah?  No woman has that much low self-esteem.  I went out with her for like three months before she's like, ah, all right, all right.  Three months?  Howdy doody looking chick.  Three months later.  That prize was yours.  What kind of fantasy was she having?  So then you lose your virginity at 17.  Yeah, yeah.  And when did you decide that now you were expert enough to start writing about this?  To be honest with you, I got a couple of negative, I had a very serious boyfriend at that time.  I got a couple of negative comments about my performance with regard to oral sex. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, well, your boyfriend was downplaying your abilities for oral sex.  Yes, but.  When was the first time you did that?  What, oral sex?  The beach.  The who?  The BJ.  Oh, the beach.  Was it before or after standard sex?  I think it was before.  Before?  It usually comes before.  Yeah, 14, 17.  A lot of women are kind of mediocre.  There's like that host, like guys, there's like the, like guys just automatically don't  know what they're doing, which is true, but they're always just like women somehow know. 
[03:13:30]  No, no, no, no, no, here's the thing.  A woman giving a hand job is the worst.  No, let me tell.  Unless you teach them.  If you teach them, they're fucking amazing.  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing.  I actually, I went to the, well, not the library.  Library.  I was going to say, you know, Urban Outfitters, which has a lot of great books on sex, like  Gay Guy's Guide to Having Sex with Men, you know, who knows better than a gay guy.  Oh, so now you're getting your instruction.  Studied up on this stuff.  I was diligent.  I mean, I read everything.  And that's how you get to be an expert.  And let me tell you, he said my performance was markedly improved. 
[03:14:00]  What a romantic guy.  Did he put it that way?  He's a good guy.  He's like, yeah.  What was his complaint?  He's like, let's see.  What was his complaint like at the beginning when you sucked?  A little bit of a teeth, I think.  A teeth?  That is the ultimate no-no.  I think it just wasn't up to par.  And now it is.  So the current boyfriend gets the benefit.  The teeth is the ultimate no-no.  Anthony can help you with that.  I can?  The teeth?  Oh, yeah.  You've got to make Charles Brunson face.  You know, Charles Brunson makes his mouth. 
[03:14:30]  You barely ever see his teeth.  He tucks his lips and ties his teeth.  You dig.  I dig to get out.  You've got to, you know, make Charles Brunson mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't even know what that is.  A lot of spit.  That's great.  You know, a lot of saliva.  Yeah.  Yeah, things like that.  Unless you're into the asshole.  You've got to use the hand as an extension of your mouth.  Yeah, there you go.  I demonstrate, but I'm not going to.  Would you like to see Ben's hog?  Yeah, no.  Thanks, though.  Yeah.  But we want to know what's going on.  Because it's either, like, a really big ball or he's packing something. 
[03:15:00]  And we've been trying to figure it out for years.  Packing.  Yeah.  Socks in your pants?  What do you mean?  I don't know.  Something's going on.  Hey, if you know right away if you're going to have sex with a guy when you're out, do  you know right away if you're not?  Yeah.  So you know right away.  You go out.  Yeah, so here's the thing.  What are some things?  The most persuasive argument comes in glasses, and it usually has a high alcoholic contact.  So, I mean, you know, if you're not impressing me with, let's say, your pedigree or, you 
[03:15:30]  know, the amounts of arcane knowledge that you can spew out, tequila shots.  Yeah, sense of humor actually does work.  It does.  But tequila shots will do it too.  I'm telling you, in case of emergency, break tequila bottle over.  Wow.  Have you ever had a guy, right, the second you saw him, okay, I'm going to fuck this guy,  but then just during the date he just so horribly fucks it.  He screwed it up.  Oh, what an asshole.  Because I think they can say, yeah, I'm going to fuck you, but there's this minefield that  you have to walk and not step on anything.  You know what, though?  The primary thing for guys is, like, total confidence. 
[03:16:00]  But you don't want to be cocky, you know?  You know, I dated a guy once who, he really, he was quite bright, but he knew it, and he's  like, da-da-da, Princeton this, Princeton that.  And I'm like, great, I know you're smart.  Stop using such big words.  You know, I know a lot of words.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Did you have sex with him?  No.  No?  And I wanted to at the beginning.  And you were gone.  See, that guy screwed it up.  This is what they want to do in the middle of the dinner date.  Take a cell phone call from your mom.  Hang on a second.  Like, still living at home. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, really?  Over.  That's bad.  That is bad.  Hey, yeah.  When are you coming home, honey?  Late?  Wow.  No, they redid the basement.  Mommy.  It's totally cool.  Yeah, leave the door open.  I'm going to be home late.  I've got to interrupt this great conversation because Jim Norton's checking in.  Oh!  Jimmy!  Hi, guys.  This is Jim Norton.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Jim.  James.  Jim usually sits in that seat over there where Bill is sitting.  Why are you MIA, Jim?  He's up.  I'm in California.  I have a question, too, about...  I think I had, like, a little faux pas on a date. 
[03:17:00]  I just caught kind of what you were saying.  Yeah.  But is it bad if you're on a date and a girl found my condoms and she's like,  what are these for?  And I said, oh, they're going to save your life tonight.  Believe me.  Yeah, that...  Somehow I'm not believing you actually said that.  If you did, I...  No, he said it.  Oh, God.  Jimmy's out in Hollywood filming a series for HBO.  Oh, what series?  It's called Lucky Louie.  It's a sitcom.  I play kind of a scumbag friend.  A brand new sitcom. 
[03:17:30]  Scumbag.  Yes.  Obviously, that's a real departure from your true persona, huh?  Yeah, I'm actually a really good guy in person.  I didn't realize you guys were talking about sex, but I don't really want to interrupt  the sex call.  I apologize.  Stop.  No, no.  So how did you apologize after she slapped you, huh?  She didn't slap me.  She just kind of freaked out a little bit.  And I tried to...  I kind of like looked at her and I'm like, ha, ha, ha.  You know, I stood up and...  You're like, it's not a really bad STD.  It's just sort of, you know, uncomfortable at times.  Yeah, no.  You know, I honestly thought I had chlamydia recently.  You know, remember I told you my whiz was burning for like a week. 
[03:18:00]  I'm not even kidding.  And I didn't say it on the air because I didn't want to freak out any chicks that I banged  at.  But it turned out it was like a...  It took out an infection.  I thought it was chlamydia.  Oh, dear God.  Yeah, Jimmy's had...  How do you get dates?  What's that?  He pays for that.  Right.  The tech book.  Yeah.  I feel like, don't worry about these scabs.  That will go away.  You asked him how he gets dates?  Yeah, it's called the Second Amendment.  Yeah, there's a website called Craigslist.  You know, actually, my roommates are from Craigslist.  They're pretty hot, let me tell you. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know.  It might not be a bad place to go.  You found your roommates on Craigslist?  Yeah.  They're really, really cute.  One was a former runner-up for Miss California.  The other looks like Paris Hilton.  They're both blonde.  I'm telling you.  Come over to my place.  Hot stuff.  Well, Jimmy's not finding that type of caliber on Craigslist.  No, he's getting ones with leg things.  What did that woman have?  Oh, it was kind of like gout.  It was called leg something where she had fat.  Do you know what this is, Miss?  Because the girl had fat feet.  Something osis or... 
[03:19:00]  It was like, yeah, water on the feet.  She had like something which made her feet swell up.  Oh, God.  Because she was too fat.  Only the best.  Well, how do you like the chicks out in Hollywood?  Much hotter, right?  Yeah, they're the same.  Their Adam's apples are hidden a little bit better.  What you can do nowadays with modern surgery, right?  Yeah.  So, no blondes that you're taking out?  Because really, you can't go to Hollywood and date a Brunette.  It's just wrong.  No, I don't do it particularly well here.  What were you talking about? 
[03:19:30]  I'm sorry.  I don't want to...  No, it's okay.  Her name's Julia, and she does a sex column for Co-Ed Magazine.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's like some magazine.  She goes out on dates and talks about the dating.  Oh, oh.  That's fascinating.  How long has the column been going?  Well, I started at Georgetown University three years ago.  Really?  You're saying this like you know, but you don't.  No.  And then I just started at Co-Ed.  Now, that was a fake laugh.  That's good.  I'm going to come after you.  And I started at Co-Ed a year ago, and I've been writing for them ever since. 
[03:20:00]  Co-EdMagazine.com.  Check it out.  Or you can check out my website, Julia Bogger.  You have a website?  I do.  Julia Bogger, B-A-U-G-H-E-R.com.  Jesus.  I never would have guessed that.  That's a brutal name to try to remember.  B-A-U-G-H-E-R.  Wow, you photographed real well.  Oh, thanks.  What is that supposed to mean? 
[03:20:30]  See, now right there.  You're dead.  Right in the middle of the date.  It's over.  If you're going to bang him, he says that in the middle of the date.  Okay, now you say something nice, like, oh.  I was just saying you photographed real well.  No, you went, oh, but you went, wow, you photographed real well.  Right.  Wow, you look so different in person.  Oh, you usually say that, though.  It's like, you know, I don't know.  Shut up, Jimmy.  No, no, you usually say that.  Like, if somebody is kind of, like, kind of pig in person but really attractive in a picture,  you'll usually say that they photographed well.  No, she's, she's, we can't even play that game. 
[03:21:00]  Is that the only picture you have on there?  Yeah, so far.  You've got to put more pictures up.  Jimmy's asking a question, ma'am.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  I apologize, but it wasn't trying to be disrespectful.  Are you very attractive?  You guys, I don't know.  You don't have to ask them, are you?  She's a very attractive girl.  She's like a six and a half.  Oh, that's cool.  Jesus.  That's it.  Never coming back here.  Oh, two.  Negative two for you.  Personality is negative eight.  OP?  She's fine, Jimmy. 
[03:21:30]  Not porn star material here.  No, I don't like porn stars.  Oh, yeah.  No one does, really.  That's why no one watches them.  I don't like porn stars.  Porn stars are disgusting.  I've seen one porn.  We've had a lot of porn stars in here, and I'm not a big fan of the porn star.  Really?  Why is that?  The fake boobs, the fake, like, stripper blonde hair.  Oh, you think these are real?  I'm saying they are.  They're not big enough to be fake.  Jimmy, don't you wish you were here?  I do, actually. 
[03:22:00]  I miss being there.  And I don't like porn stars either.  They're gross.  Yeah, porn stars suck.  Give a girl money.  She fucks you.  Who needs that?  I don't think, actually, that's what porn stars do.  I think you're confusing them with prostitutes.  Well, Jimmy likes prostitutes.  Oh, yeah.  It's his hobby.  If I were an investment banker in this city, and I was very busy, and I just needed a GFE, girlfriend experience, I'd go for the escorts, you know?  Yeah.  That's what Jimmy does.  I'm not sure I'd have sex with them.  It's a little bit dangerous, you know, but...  Well, just hang out and, like...  Do you have, like, abbreviations like that in your columns? 
[03:22:30]  Like, people read it after a while, like, GFE?  Yeah.  I mean, I advocated for a long time something called dating with a lowercase d, which means you're not just hooking up with a guy,  but you're actually, you know, going out with him, getting him to spend money on you, that kind of thing.  Uh-oh.  Take you to Tiffany's before you...  Why do you call it with a lowercase d?  I'm sorry.  That's horse shit with a lowercase h.  Because you're not married.  You know, like, a lot of people in college, they're either hooking up or they feel like they're in this exclusive relationship.  I'm not, you know, the biggest advocate of exclusive relationships in college. 
[03:23:00]  I don't think it's necessarily a great idea.  So that's why there's a lowercase d, Jimmy.  Lowercase d.  Well, the thing is...  Oh, isn't it like you're not kind of committed?  You're not committed, yeah.  People are really obsessed with commitment in college.  It's too young to be obsessed.  Jimmy dates with a capital A-I-D-S.  That's right.  After I blasted with something, I apologized with a lowercase a.  Yeah, yeah.  I apologized with what exactly?  Jimmy's a little different than you and I. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, yeah?  How so?  Short?  You might want to ask him.  You might want to ask him what he's into.  Jimmy, what are you into?  I'm actually not into anything.  Trendies?  No, no, no, no, no.  I mean, no, as well.  A little bit.  No, not at all.  I'm not actually going to say anything particularly crazy.  No.  No.  Liar.  Logs.  It's always the one that looks...  Oh, God.  Dear God.  Yeah.  Did you hear them?  The ones that look the most innocent, I think, that are really the worst.  He doesn't really look innocent.  There are times when he has women over that he has to put down a tarp on his bathroom floor 
[03:24:00]  is what he is into sometimes.  You know, somehow I don't believe that.  I've actually never met anyone who's been into that, but maybe I just...  Believe it.  You just did.  We set you up.  We got your column for January.  You're there.  Logs.  Yeah, no.  My mother edits my column, so I don't really think...  Your mother edits your column?  Yeah, she was a former speechwriter for Nixon, and she edits my columns.  Yeah.  How did she go from Nixon to a column about sucking cock?  I was...  You know... 
[03:24:30]  That's just wrong.  Thank God she doesn't have XM.  Me and Kissinger were in the Oval Office.  He pulled his pants down.  He had a lovely, clipped Jewish cock.  Yeah, not sure that ever happened.  I want to put peanut butter eyeballs so Sheckers can lick it off.  Yeah, this was, of course, before Monica.  Right.  Yeah, no, she's a great editor.  Yeah, she's...  My father's a little more conservative. 
[03:25:00]  Does she know Ben Stein?  She does, yeah.  Because he was the speechwriter also.  Yeah, he was.  One of.  One of.  There were quite a few for old Tricky Dick.  He was probably the best-looking one.  Aren't you a little concerned about revealing personal information in your column when your  mom's reading it?  Yes, but you know what?  I'm concerned for about two minutes, and then I get over it.  Did she have been shocked by something she read in there?  Yeah, she's a little confused about booty call.  She was like, what is a booty call?  Really?  That was pretty tame, though. 
[03:25:30]  That was pretty tame.  Yeah.  How do you explain it?  How do you explain it?  You know, I believe in openness.  I told her.  I actually, I told her before.  Shut up, Jimmy.  How did I explain booty call, you mean?  Yeah.  Well, because it's very awkward.  If you've got to talk to us talking, it's one thing.  But when you've got to talk to your mom, that must have been crazy.  You know, it's definitely opened up our relationship, that's for sure.  Yeah, I said, Mom, it's, you know, sometimes late at night, women and men, mostly men, but  sometimes women, they just have needs. 
[03:26:00]  And she said, I understand that.  She and my father, I'm sure, are having a good time.  I don't want to think about it too much, but, you know, they're cute, very in love still.  So she's like pretty open.  She's like, yeah, when I was in my mid-20s, I was crazy.  I'm like, oh, don't get too much into that.  That's enough.  Thanks.  Right.  So any women on women?  That's how I go from one segment to another.  Any girl on girl?  Girl on girl.  With you?  Any dates, like with the girl on girl? 
[03:26:30]  Nothing like that?  No, I did have a, you know, I had a girlfriend in college.  Ooh.  Quite, no, no, no, a girl space friend in college.  See, I never call my friends boyfriends.  Yeah, but, you know.  I never go, I'm going out with my boyfriends tonight.  You know, it comes up to a little bit.  You're right.  No, guys don't do that, but girls do.  They say they're girlfriends.  They say that all the time.  She, one of her favorite things to do, she had quite large breasts, although that's sort  of ancillary to this.  She loved to kiss girls.  Is she a...  No, no, no.  It's her name.  Your mother's sister? 
[03:27:00]  No, no.  This girl...  Oh, oh, ancillary.  I get you.  I thought it was her name.  Her name was Abby, or still is, I guess, and she loved to kiss girls to get guys' attention.  Not like, you know...  It was going wild kind of thing.  Only in front of other guys, you know.  It wasn't like she would kiss you, you know, when she's at home.  And she wasn't gay.  She just...  It was the attention thing.  It was sort of hot, you know.  So she used to kiss all of our girlfriends.  What was that noise that stopped finally?  I don't know.  That was Jimmy going away.  Yeah, Jimmy had to get back to the set. 
[03:27:30]  We're going to go to the phones in a second, though.  Oh, damn it.  You want to take some phone calls from our listeners?  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  All right, let's see.  Wow.  Let's go to a lot of them, huh?  Do you guys have fun at dating questions?  Yeah, I'm trying to get some good ones here.  We got Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve from Yellowstone.  You're on with Julia.  That's Julia.  Hi, Steve.  She writes a column for Co-Ed Magazine, Steve.  Hi, Julia.  How are you?  Good.  I've just been running into a problem where I've been seeing this girl, and she's saying  that I'm too neat, and I speak too well, and that I'm too cozy, and I'm not too sure 
[03:28:00]  what to do.  She thinks I might be gay, although I'm not gay.  I just have certain mannerisms that are very, very homoerotic.  Ah, I understand.  I understand your problem.  You're from New York, I'm guessing.  I'm from Yellowstone.  Uh, okay, well.  Ramone!  Tell the orders to pay attention!  Oh, well, uh, yes.  I have no idea what that meant.  But let me...  Ramone!  Bring me a woman who sucks cock and shuts up!  Wow.  Who is this guy? 
[03:28:30]  Definitely homoerotic.  Let me tell you this, though.  You know, we've got our listeners.  We want, uh, uh, serious questions only, and...  Ramone!  Fuck this girl with a stick!  Ew.  What is going on in Yellowstone?  I don't know.  Maybe he's a little bored or something.  I don't know.  Listen, lay off the booze in the morning, man.  Exactly.  What is fun?  Talking with booze does not matter.  Ramone!  Shut this whore up!  Yeah, that's enough.  We've got to go...  That guy is really frightening.  Sounds like he had too much... 
[03:29:00]  Angry.  Sorry, Julia.  Sounds like he had too much honey in his teeth.  Exactly.  Do you come across many angry guys like this?  Yeah.  What is that?  I wrote an article about ugly men dating attractive women, which happens all the time in this unfortunate  society we live in.  And a guy wrote me this angry email.  He's like, listen, that's true, but, you know, I think that you shouldn't harsh on guys  with game.  He said, guys only need game.  They don't need attractiveness, and you're not even that hot. 
[03:29:30]  Harsh on guys?  Yeah, harsh.  Yeah, apparently that's like an 80s word or something that he's reviving.  All right.  All right, let's go to the podium.  So, yeah, there are angry guys out there.  Angry guys.  This guy's one of them.  Let's say hi to Andrew in Brooklyn.  Andrew!  Hey, ONA, Bill, ho, how you doing?  Sorry, did you call me ho?  No, no, no, I have a question.  I'm dating a girl right now, right?  Okay.  And she doesn't quite understand that it's my house, my rules.  You can either have a doggy style on your back.  Light and a whore!  Light and a whore! 
[03:30:00]  Is that...  Do you guys usually...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jesus.  Are there any serious calls?  If this happens so often...  Wait, I've seen something.  Please make her cry.  Where?  It's just weird.  Polo from New York.  That's weird.  Tuesday.  I'm about Tuesday.  Well, here's a good question from Vern.  Crazy.  Vern?  Yes.  Go ahead, Vern.  I had a question for her.  How come when you see a girl and you get to know her and then you get shoved off into what we call the friendship or the big brother zone? 
[03:30:30]  Oh, very good question.  Thank you for axing.  Acting?  Acting.  What am I saying?  Axing.  Is it Vern?  Vern?  Was that Vern?  Yeah, it's Vern.  That's a great question.  You know what?  I think it's because of your confidence or lack of.  If you act like you are a sex god, she will not shove you off into the friend zone.  It does not matter what you look like.  Check out this book called The Game by Neil Strauss.  I'm telling you, if you want game, read this book.  Copy what he's doing. 
[03:31:00]  Anyone can get any girl with this book.  I'm telling you.  Did you check that out from Urban Outfitters?  Yeah, right.  Good.  No, actually, it's like Barnes & Noble.  I don't know.  You said the library.  I mean Urban Outfitters earlier.  Yeah, you're right.  Laszlo's back with his clever comments.  Well, yeah, Laszlo.  I'm just kidding.  Laszlo.  Laszlo, let her be, man.  She's doing a great job for us today.  No, I'm serious, though, because a lot of guys get shoved off into this just friends  thing, and they think there's something wrong with them.  There's nothing.  They just aren't having enough confidence.  They don't have, you know, the moves.  You've got to pull it out. 
[03:31:30]  All right, let's say.  Yeah, no, that's not going to work.  That will get you arrested.  We're going to go to a.  Be surprised.  Yeah, they'll be surprised.  All right.  We're going to go to a college town.  That's not going to work for anybody else.  College town.  You just hit that awkward moment.  I'm taking it out.  When have you ever done that?  You talk a big game.  I'm not feeling it.  Okay.  I mean, they don't have to believe me.  I mean, I'm really not trying to convince you.  This is the guy that went from I'm saving it for my future husband to backdoor action  three months.  He's got some game. 
[03:32:00]  And if he felt he.  No, three months.  Three months is not game.  I don't have game.  I know guys.  Pulling it out is game.  Yeah, that's game.  That's a risky move.  But I stole that.  I stole that from Bobby Kelly.  Yeah.  I was living with the time.  He goes, dude, you pull it out.  He goes, it's like you're hitting the time.  Jay Moore calls it.  What are we going to do about this?  He said he would sit in a car with a girl and they're talking.  And when he gets impatient, he just pulls his dick out and looks at her and goes, what  are we going to do about this?  I sincerely hope the next time he does that, she has the guts to call Richard Johnson and 
[03:32:30]  report it because that is just nasty.  Isn't that funny?  It's Dick Johnson.  40% success rate.  All right, well, let's go to a college town in Boston.  I hope he's like, yes.  I'm trying to sink into some real shit here.  You know what?  I haven't did that.  I'm the only...  You're just sitting on the couch and all of a sudden you're not going to go into that.  Hopi.  You just pulled it out.  I'm trying to help you out.  All right, let's go to Boston and say hi to Ben.  Ben in Boston.  Ben in Boston.  Hi, Ben.  Hello?  Ben.  You're on the air.  Ben.  You're on with Julia. 
[03:33:00]  I've been seeing this girl and she keeps laughing and stuff because my heart is so big.  Yeah, that's hilarious.  You talked with Tom Brady.  Tom Brady?  I swear to God, your collars are all in crack.  Ramones, shoulders or this bit is tired, but he doesn't care.  Ramones.  Or they're the same collar over and over and over.  This is Steve from Yellowstone again.  What?  Steve.  You guys have the worst screener in the history of the world. 
[03:33:30]  Our screener stinks.  Who's the intern?  I'm going to come after you and pull it out.  Danny, and he's terrible at screening calls.  Danny.  Danny, you suck.  Get your ass in here.  You can't tell Steve from Yellowstone.  That guy sucks.  I knew the second I heard it was Ben from Boston, I knew it was going to be Steve from Yellowstone.  How did you know?  All right, Ben.  Because I heard his voice.  Ben?  I heard his voice.  Thank you, Ben.  Get someone real.  Now, come on, guys.  Yeah, let's go to Sean.  We got a great opportunity to learn a little something here. 
[03:34:00]  Sean?  Yeah.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's up?  Hi, Sean.  Hey, you've got to have this going on every week.  I don't know about that.  There you go.  Thanks, Sean.  Because you found the perfect hole ever on radio.  Wow.  What is with the hole thing?  The hole.  It's like...  She's an intelligent woman.  Thank you.  She's an expert, and her mom edits her column.  Right.  Calm down.  Maybe we should edit this show.  Maybe we should have our moms here, Opie.  Yeah, what would your mom say if they were here? 
[03:34:30]  What would they say?  She'd say, thank you for the checks you send me.  Do your moms listen to the show?  Do any of your moms listen to this show?  No.  Are they frightened?  Are you like, I'm not buying you a radio?  My mom turns it off while she's driving, she says.  My mom turned off the show when we were doing the fart game recently.  Yeah.  Really?  She's like, that's very inappropriate, Opie.  Yeah.  I trained you better than that.  Does she say that?  She's like, I'm humiliated?  Again, I'm just switching segments.  Next segment.  That has nothing to do...  No, no, don't take it personally. 
[03:35:00]  No, it's fine.  Nothing to do with it.  I'm just going to cry.  You know, make a listener happy.  I'm crying.  Let's say hi to Jammer.  Hey, what's going on here?  What's up, Jammer?  Joey, I got a question for you.  I'm a truck driver.  Is it inappropriate to grab a girl by the back of her hair, and when she's going down  on it, just keep jamming it in there until she gags?  That's a good question.  Yeah, until she gags.  I don't think you want to kill, you know, the girl you're hooking up with.  Yeah, but it's hot.  Is it hot?  It depends on, you know, is she into the sort of, like, force thing?  I think some women are into that, you know? 
[03:35:30]  It's sort of hot to have a very aggressive man.  Well, she's into it until I let her go.  Is this a lot, Lizard?  Wow.  Ew.  That's sort of weird.  I mean, honestly, though, like, if you want an honest answer, you just want to sort of,  you know, fuck around.  I don't know.  I can't tell.  It seems like all the callers want to fuck around.  But I think if she's into the aggressive foreplay, then yeah, but, like, don't hurt her.  I mean, she's not going to give you a good head if you hurt her.  My God.  Maybe a gag is not a good idea.  Yeah.  Is it true the difference between like and love?  It's fitting and swallowing? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, actually.  That is true.  I like that.  I'm going to use that.  Nice.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  What's that, guys?  Oh.  I'm out.  All right.  We got a call from Jersey.  Henry.  Hello.  Henry.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Hi, Henry.  Is it Henry?  It's Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Okay.  We don't know.  Okay.  Hey, French.  Now, the French are known for romance and love, right?  Are you French, Henry?  Henri.  Well, I think that's pretty obvious.  I wanted to ask you a question.  Since he was talking about the French.  I want to ask you a question. 
[03:36:30]  I want to answer it immediately.  Immediately.  I want to ask you a question.  Since the French are such good lovers, as you were just told, I have a woman who I'm  talking to currently who maybe, you know, she doesn't understand how much of a good  lover I am.  Oh.  So what I was asking, Conte, is like, when I'm having oral sex with this woman, she doesn't  exactly take it all the way down to the testicles.  I'm wondering, is there any way I could get her to maybe do that?  To do that?  Well, you have been, I'm sort of confused as to how this has anything to do with you 
[03:37:00]  being a good lover.  I mean, if she's not noticing that, maybe you're not a good lover.  I don't know.  That having been said, you do realize that the most sensitive area of the penis is actually  the tip.  So I'm not really sure why you want it all the way down.  No, no, Conte, because the shaft, obviously, to me, is the most sensitive part.  To you?  To the French, the shaft is very sensitive.  Is that it?  What, Conte?  I'm trying to ask you how to get this woman to...  Hey, hey, I don't respond to the C word, so...  What do you talk?  What do you talk?  What do you think I'm trying to... 
[03:37:30]  This woman's a bitch.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  Just because...  You know...  I'm a little harsh.  Why does this happen?  That was brutal, actually.  I think there are a lot of men who have issues, maybe, you know, with their mothers originally  or something.  I think you're exactly right.  I think the new round of interns may not be as good call screeners.  Interns are going to get beaten.  Let's say hi to another trucker.  Chuck.  Hi, Chuck.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi.  Chuck, do you respect women, hopefully?  What?  How does a 55-year-old man like myself go around hooking up with, like, a 15, 16-year-old 
[03:38:00]  girl?  What do I have to do?  That's a good question.  Jesus.  Honestly, can you just raise the age, like, three years so you're legal?  Because that will get you in jail.  Yeah, but, you know...  Hey, I'm on the road.  They'll never see me again.  Uh, um, well, 15, I mean, 15, that's, like, that's a little disgusting.  But is it consensual?  18 is, yeah, well, what's with the focus on that?  Um, I'd go for 18.  I'd go for college, you know?  I mean, honestly, why, why take it younger than that? 
[03:38:30]  That's sort of gross.  But if you're, you're 55, you said?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Um, I don't know.  I mean, maybe take them out to nice...  Most of the girls I know are not interested in, in men that old if you're, if they're 18 years  old, however, I mean, maybe you get to a college town and...  Maybe not a truck driver.  Maybe if he, uh, maybe if he had some cake, you know.  Depends on what college.  Hollywood.  Maybe a little money.  Hollywood, right?  Hollywood.  Yeah, I know.  The old story, like, my sister's a hooker and, and stuff, and should I tell her about my  other, my other brother is a truck driver, right? 
[03:39:00]  You drive the truck by the schools.  You, you ask them if they want to see what the sleeper cab looks like.  And once they're in there, boom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom,  mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom,  and it's over, Johnny.  All the ones who get in here in the hall, their horns.  That's my advice.  I just, yeah, I throw it out there.  Let's see what sticks.  Hey, why don't we get a call from a lady?  That could help us out here today, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Ah, the men have let us down today.  Amy.  Hey.  What you want to do? 
[03:39:30]  I did have a question.  Like, I really, I like giving my husband head, but, like, every night when I do it,  I want to swallow, but, like, his mind over matter just don't let me.  Yeah, I hear you.  Like, how can I get over that?  Because I know he really wants it.  You know what I think is a very effective tool?  Hold your nose.  No, no, no.  I'm so serious.  First of all, if you're doing it with a room dark, have a Kleenex near my spit and then say you swallowed.  Very effective.  Really?  Well, if you're doing it in the shower, he will never know if you just sort of let it dribble out. 
[03:40:00]  I'm telling you, that's the way to go.  Lying.  So this is your relationship advice.  Lying.  About this small thing, you know what?  It is very effective.  And have you guys ever tried to swallow it?  I don't think so.  So, next time.  No one is going to go down my throat.  Disgust me.  Yeah.  It's like, right now, like, when I think about it, it's like, it turns me on.  You don't swallow the goo then?  And it actually happens.  Like, I just can't do it.  I have to finish it off.  Julie, you don't go that far with that? 
[03:40:30]  I can't do it.  Well, I think he's, I think, who is that who said it's the difference between like and love?  I mean, when it's with your husband, it's one thing, you know?  I really think.  Yeah, I know what he's eating, so I know what's going in there, but.  Oh, dear God.  Hopefully lots of.  You know, I think if you just think about, if you just think, if you focus on how hot  it is and how much you need, you're so into it, and then just pretend like you're swallowing  pills.  I don't know.  I mean, I, that's, that's very effective.  Swallowing pills?  Swallowing pills?  Yeah, why not?  More Percocets, please.  Some water.  That's hot.  Dear God.  You know what I like to do? 
[03:41:00]  If the girl does spit it in the tissue, I like picking up the tissue and eating it.  Yes.  It really gets the girl.  I really like Godwin.  Oh, yeah.  I like the angry pirate.  And what's the angry pirate?  That's where you shoot a load in her eye and you kick her in the shin so she hops around.  You guys have serious issues.  With one eye shut and going, arrr.  Arr.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, Amy.  All right, yeah.  Happy swallowing.  You know something, though?  I think this is an exchange of knowledge right here.  As we get an education from you about the girl's side of the whole dating thing, you're 
[03:41:30]  getting a crash course in what guys are like when they're alone in a room with other  guys chit-chatting.  Yeah, yeah.  Unfortunately, when they're sitting across from you at a table in a restaurant, no, they're  the same guys.  You don't remember that writer on Friends who sued because she was hanging out and all the  writers were going, hey, what if Monica got raped and Baja just kicking around ideas  and she sued?  That's seriously, though?  That's, like, really fucked up, though.  But the guys that you sit across from at a table, at dinner, that are being all nice,  they're the same guys that are on that phone right now calling with horrific things. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, dear God.  Isn't that awful?  Well, it does make you worried.  You know, I think I'm a pretty open-minded person, but there are certain things you just  don't joke about.  You know, molestation, rape.  I don't think that's, like...  Those are the things you joke about, but then what are the bad ones?  Who's that?  That's terrific.  That's one of the answers.  Oh, the engineers in the studio.  Oh, my God.  Isn't that horrible?  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Yeah.  No, no, I'm serious, though.  I mean, like, there are lots of things that you can talk about with sex and that kind of  thing, but that kind of stuff is just wrong, you know? 
[03:42:30]  You don't have to go to, like, you know, when I go out on date, it's an Amber Alert.  An Amber Alert.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  That's not funny.  It's bad.  No, it's really sick.  Yeah, it's sick.  I'm actually being quite good.  Who is that?  I think it's Super Agent Bob Eaton laughing at everything.  Although I do like this Nintendo, old-school Nintendo music.  I have the old-school Nintendo at home.  Yeah, actually, it's a huge conversation piece.  Guys love it.  When they come over, they're like, sweet.  This lets us know we have mere minutes left in the program. 
[03:43:00]  Ah, I know you guys are all crying.  You're like, please, make her leave.  Ah, this was a great segment.  I think you did a great job.  Yeah, you look excited, Opie.  What?  You're like, uh...  This is why we...  What happened?  Gene Simmons, no show.  Uh, uh, Brad from the Islanders, where was he?  Uh, Laszlo, who gives a shit?  Laszlo looks like someone.  Who does he look like?  Laszlo?  He's famous.  No, no, seriously.  He does all the voices for DTA.  I usually get Kid Rock. 
[03:43:30]  Yes, that's it.  I usually get Kid Rock.  Yeah, like homeless people will stop and say, you know, can I have some money?  And I'm like, no.  And they go, I bought your last album.  Like, you're fucking homeless.  You're like, how's Pam in bed?  No, seriously, tell me.  Time to go to the next segment.  Yes.  Laszlo, don't look so excited.  No, I've learned from listening to this show that that means it's time for the next segment.  I got it.  So it's Julia from Co-Ed Magazine.  Yep.

[03:44:00]  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  Only the classic Warner Bros. cartoons.  Only the classics.  That was so disrespectful.  I'm sorry.  That was really bad.  You guys are really...  Give the plug.  Do you have wives?  Do they like you still?  Not anymore.  Yeah.  We have women that love us.  You nailed me from the beginning.  You were like, this guy's a dick.  He's an asshole.  Fucking Bill just goes, no. 
[03:44:30]  Who the hell would be with us?  Sad.  Which is how bitter men are.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
