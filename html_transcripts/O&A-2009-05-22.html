<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Anthony Cumia's absence due to a severe case of diarrhea, graphically detailed throughout the show, allegedly caused by chicken fajitas from Poco Loco. Opie recounts numerous calls from a suffering Anthony from the toilet, emphasizing the comedically unfortunate timing and descriptions.  The show then revisits a previous segment featuring a caller named Lydia who offered highly uncomfortable but funny psychological analyses of Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Lydia's assessment included Opie's anger issues, Anthony's potential for self-isolation, and Jim's sexual issues, alongside extensive commentary on Lydia's physical appearance.

The hosts then discuss a man who received a face transplant after a subway accident, finding humor in his claim of looking the same, and a porn star's failed oral sex world record attempt due to respiratory issues.  Several listener calls follow: one deeply personal and emotional story about a caller’s daughter’s death causes discomfort, another is a birthday wish for Opie, and Christopher Lloyd's birthday call to Anthony is also mentioned.  In-studio guest Sam Roberts discusses his exclusive interview with Vince McMahon, focusing on the controversy surrounding the relocation of a WWE Raw event from Denver due to a scheduling conflict with a Denver Nuggets game.  The hosts and Sam analyze the press release, finding it self-serving, and Stryker calls in to provide further context on the arena situation.  Sam's past as an illegal wrestling tape trader is also discussed.  The segment ends with more birthday wishes for Opie and continued graphic descriptions of Anthony's condition.

A phone interview with Vince McMahon follows.  The conversation humorously begins with McMahon's near-miss with a falling set, attributing his survival to being a "man of steel" and mentioning Mr. Fuji's investigation.  This leads to discussion of Mr. Fuji's age and past stereotypical portrayals. The conversation shifts to McMahon's dispute with Stan Kroenke over arena usage, with McMahon using improvised humor and nicknames, referencing photoshopped press release images.  A listener call clarifies Mr. Fuji's involvement, referencing a "Tuesday Night Titans" skit, "Fuji Vice." McMahon expresses openness to future appearances but seems eager to end the call.

After the interview, the hosts mock Sam Roberts’ intense passion for wrestling and collecting memorabilia, sharing a humorous anecdote about him getting a Hulk Hogan autograph at a Florida gun store.  A WWE live read interrupts, followed by voicemails from the "FU line."  A discussion of Bob Kelly's poor grammar and repetitive Twitter feed leads to a call from Eric "Elo" Toppenberg, who discusses his weight loss, sobriety, his employment at Oprah's show, a new singing sensation on Oprah’s show, and his missed camaraderie with the Opie and Anthony team.  He also shares a story about a passenger spotting a fuel leak on a flight.

The show heavily focuses on Opie's 39th birthday, with numerous calls, some planned, some unexpected.  Opie recounts a plane incident involving a fuel leak.  Birthday calls include one from an ex-girlfriend, causing discomfort for Opie and Weezy, a frequent caller, who also discusses his planned birthday trip and tattoos. The conversation shifts to 9/11 conspiracy theories, referencing previous guests like Jesse Ventura and Dr. Michio Kaku, leading to a discussion of government accountability and information reliability.  Dane Cook calls in, discussing his tour and collaboration with Robert Kelly, focusing on Kelly's bizarre website photos. Jim Norton's comedy engagements and New Jersey Hall of Fame induction are also discussed, alongside anecdotes about false accusations of domestic abuse and pedophilia.  Terrell Owens' upcoming appearance is mentioned.  The show promotes Vossipedia, presents Opie with a surprise cake, and plays a pre-recorded segment with Andrew Dice Clay Silverstein.  A guest named Mare engages in bizarre conversations, including discussing her booger-saving habit. E-Rock's planned birthday appearance is cancelled after he tells Opie to "go fuck himself."

The show continues with the description of a young woman wiping her booger on Opie's arm as a birthday "cake," and failed attempts to get E-Rock involved.  A female guest ("Mayor"), described as a nose-picker and diet pill user, engages in bizarre conversations about bodily fluids. Her Twitter following increases after her appearance.  The conversation includes an upcoming Rich Voss segment, a birthday call from a friend, and further discussion of the Mayor's unusual habits, including examining her menstrual fluid.  The hosts and Mayor engage in increasingly absurd and vulgar discussions about bodily fluids.  A listener suggests "Clots and Snot" as a nickname for the Mayor.  The conversation moves to a foot fetish photo shoot featuring the Mayor's large toe, leading to sexually suggestive comments and a call-in segment for foot fetish photo advice.  A birthday message from Louis C.K. is received.  The segment heavily features Rich Voss's Twitter account, after he inadvertently reveals his password on air, with a Kentucky listener gaining control and posting inappropriate content.

The final segment focuses on the fallout from Rich Voss revealing his password ("comic 630"), leading to the hacking of his accounts.  The hosts react to updates to his Wikipedia page, his new profile picture (a horse's ass), and mispronunciations compiled on "Oapedia," leading to a “Voscabulary” segment. Voss’s wife, Bonnie, calls in, expressing frustration over Voss's insensitivity, lack of childcare help, and discussing his personality and habits. The hosts repeatedly express amusement over Voss’s blunders and Bonnie’s reactions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Swine flu.  The swine flu has taken out Anthony Cumia.  Anthony Cumia.  Good morning, welcome to the, what is it today, Opian Gym, we'll call it.  It's Opian Anthony minus Anthony.  Sons Anthony.  Sons Anthony.  Sons.  I hate that word. 
[00:00:30]  That's terrible.  See, it worked like a charm, though, because Anthony was calling my cell phone around, I think he started calling around 4.30.  But I answered his phone call at 5 o'clock when I finally woke up.  See, the beauty of turning your cell phone off.  What time do you get up normally?  Five.  All right.  I don't want to be woken up at 4.30 hearing him having explosive diarrhea into the bowl.  Is he really shitting? 
[00:01:00]  Good.  Poor Anthony's tummy.  Good.  There's nothing better than knowing your friend is your shitting liquid.  Oh, my God.  There's nothing left.  I'm drinking water to try to rehydrate, but it's like the puckering asshole now.  It's just like, wham, wham, like after a horse takes a dump, that's what his ass does.  Like, it's so embarrassing calling Opi from the toilet. 
[00:01:30]  And I believed you, too, because the echo.  I mean, how fucking big is your bathroom?  Well, it's pretty big.  Yeah.  But you know something, even a big bathroom's a lonely place when you're rocketing out your ass.  So when did you get sick last night, or did you wake up and start feeling terrible?  Yeah, last night a little bit, but for the most part, I just thought, you know, whatever.  I'll go to sleep and wake up, and it'll be fine.  And I got up, I got dressed, and I was ready to just get in the truck and start driving. 
[00:02:00]  And I was like, you know something?  I should probably sit on the toilet for a minute.  And that minute turned into just, I can't leave this bowl.  I cannot leave the fucking bowl.  I hope it gets to the point where you're dry heaving.  That is all I was talking about.  It was.  It was just.  Okay, you're up to the dry heaving?  That only happened to me once, and it's just an unbelievable experience,  because your asshole is still trying to do its job, but nothing is left. 
[00:02:30]  It looked like slag, like something you'd call slag or slurry.  A slurry in the bottom.  It's horrible.  Do you think you ate something bad?  It might have been something I ate.  I've been trying to go through everything I ate yesterday, and I don't know.  It could have been a number of things.  Well, we know what we hope it wasn't.  Well, maybe it's all that raw chopped meat you're eating.  That must be it. 
[00:03:00]  Chopped meat.  Going with the chopped meat character that Anthony is known as.  I didn't even get that.  I'm so stupid.  Yeah, of course.  How ironic.  It looked like chopped meat.  We're starting to think it was dinner, because we all ate the same thing yesterday.  Yes, we did.  And you're the only one that has this problem.  It definitely wasn't the turkey chili, because I had some of that.  We're thinking it had to be something after you left here. 
[00:03:30]  Well, last night, I did have chicken fajitas.  Oh.  So that might have done something.  A little spicy.  Where did you get the chicken fajitas from?  Over at Poco Loco.  You love that place.  I love the Poco Loco, but it's, wow.  Yeah, but maybe they finally figured out you're a racist and said, you know, we'll take care of this motherfucker.  He hates us.  Oh, my God.  No, it's not.  Jesus. 
[00:04:00]  They were all rubbing a pre-com inside of your chicken wrap.  They're rubbing their quesadillas.  I thought it was very tasty.  They're just rubbing the quesadillas on their ball bags.  Oh, we'll show this motherfucker.  Can I tell you, that segment yesterday, where you started playing the sound effects.  Oh, my God.  It was, I listened to it.  I was in the truck last night, and I listened to a lot of the Lydia segment.  And I knew it was coming up, and I laughed so fucking hard.  I was doubled over on the steering wheel laughing. 
[00:04:30]  It was so uncomfortable and funny.  Maybe it's God punishing me.  Dude, that was.  You know what?  It might be God's revenge.  Why?  If you were shitting and your heart fell out, that would be punishment for that.  Yeah, because he could get that done.  That was.  Yes, he could.  Dude.  God could do that.  I was doubled over.  I had to pull over, but I was already pulled over.  But I was doubled over the steering wheel laughing.  That was so goddamn funny and brutal. 
[00:05:00]  That was so fucking wrong to do.  Well, you know, you've got to check your guilt at the door there at the radio station.  That's part of being a comic, I guess, too.  It's like, there's times where there's inappropriate laughs.  You know, it happens.  You know, you laugh when you're not supposed to.  We don't know how to handle it sometimes, so we just act stupid.  That was fine.  In the end, it was fine.  Yeah, he was okay with it.  He knew what the shirt was going.  I was just pissed at the instant feedback or thinking it was me.  Go fuck yourself.  I still say fuck you and your mother. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, that guy.  That was my insensitivity.  Go, why don't you pay attention?  Yeah, that was very uncomfortable.  So I'm thinking it's the quesadillas.  Yeah, or the fajitas.  Yeah, it was chicken fajitas.  Oh, fajitas, fajitas, right.  Do you need someone to rub a little salve on your hiney, Ant?  Yeah, I need a little salve.  I'm going through those whites like crazy.  My whole cesspool is going to be filled up with those fucking things.  And Ant hates the bathroom. 
[00:06:00]  No.  Ant doesn't do well with duty, so this has got to be just a complete nightmare for you.  Is your ass all burning?  Oh, boy.  I need big-duty hat guy to come in.  Oh, yeah.  Were we on the air when we were talking about how he just kind of went away?  We were, right?  Who?  Yeah.  I was just talking about off the air, on the air, how he was such a big star.  Cream Pie Jones?  Yeah.  Guy picked up shit and we forgot his name.  That was terrible.  Wow.  You're so right. 
[00:06:30]  It's that wave.  Those waves of, like, sweating and the abdominal pain that comes in.  And then the watery shit, it goes away for a little while.  And then you've got to sit there because there's acid on your asshole.  Uh, I need to put, like, I need to put baking soda on my ass to utilize the acid.  There's nothing worse.  It's just, it truly is.  Your asshole has complete control over your body. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Because you just can't fucking think or anything when you've got to shit and it's just awfulness.  I was telling Jimmy, too, you know, everyone knows I don't, I don't keep my cell phone on at night.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you can wait for everything until you wake up.  Yeah.  And then you have a clear head because you had a good night's sleep.  Yeah.  And I need to hear this.  My alarm goes off.  I turn and there's my phone just, it just said Anthony on the cell phone because it's on silent. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Anthony.  And I'm up for seconds.  Dude, I got an explosive diarrhea.  I'm like, oh, what a way to wake up.  What the fuck?  The echo of the turlet.  Maybe you got the swine flu, though.  No, I don't have the cold or anything.  Which, you know, I don't know what I have the fucking, does swine flu come out your ass?  They're saying salmonella from the chicken. 
[00:08:00]  No, I don't feel, it's just, it's obviously I ate something too fucking spicy or whatever it is.  I don't know.  It's something disagreeing with you.  It's probably not food poisoning.  You'd be really sick.  Yeah, there are three things I ate yesterday, one of which I really hope it isn't.  Yeah.  The other two, I could give a shit.  I could give a lot of shit.  And then.  We need a doctor.  How many hours does it take from eating something to explosive diarrhea? 
[00:08:30]  I know every once in a while.  I was feeling it like at about five o'clock yesterday afternoon.  Like the, the, the, the, the, the, the bloatiness and the hot gas.  Everyone's saying they can hear your video game in the background.  Are you playing a video game right now?  What?  There's nothing on in here.  No. 
[00:09:00]  What a video game.  I hear a little echo of myself, but that's just the phone.  What a great way to start your three day weekend.  Just shitting stomach bile.  Yeah.  I'm really, really hoping this clears up pronto.  You don't think I'm, I'm sitting here a bit happy.  You don't, you don't, you don't think we're, I mean, if you guys think we're staying to  the end today, you know, you're high.  Yeah.  Since Anthony called me this morning, I'm like, man, it's off me.  I all have to do is show up for a couple hours, put in the effort and get the fuck out 
[00:09:30]  and start the nice long weekend because it's my, it's my birthday weekend.  That's it.  You're a hero now because you were there.  That's right.  I even wrote bladder.  I'm like, it's got explosive diarrhea.  Jimmy's got to leave early for LA.  Look, man, I'm going to go in and try to figure it out, but I don't know what I'm going to  do yet.  That's what, that's what I told him.  We're the only idiots doing a show this morning, aren't we?  Yeah.  Well, we're always the only idiots doing a show because we, because guess what?  As much as people like try to slam us, we, we give a shit about our, our, our show and 
[00:10:00]  our product.  Everyone else that when, whenever they can, they take a day off.  There's no one here at there's literally no one here.  Yeah.  I assumed that there was not going to be anybody there.  How about this?  The guys that run the channel.  Yeah.  Quotes in the air.  Uh, they're not even here.  They took the day off.  The guys that are responsible for our channel took the day off.  But do they have diarrhea? 
[00:10:30]  How about they let us know and go, you know what?  It would be, it would be smart to just take Friday off.  We are, and we run your channel.  Well, uh, no guilt here.  A couple hours and we're out, Jim.  Yeah.  I say, I say, I say we do like till about six 40 and fucking leave.  Watch how I cleverly, uh, make an excuse why we need to replay the rich Voss, uh, giving  out his password bit.  It was very funny.  That was, that's one of the biggest laughs I've had in a year. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Me and Voss walked back in on the break and we're told what that dummy had actually done.  I got his act falling out of my asshole.  Poor Voss.  Poor dumb rich.  Hey, God bless his dumb soul.  Lomox.  Before we let Anthony go and, uh, go back to shitting, when was the last time you had a  little movement?  Uh, probably about 15 minutes ago.  Oh, you might be heading.  It's working pretty steady every half hour or so.  It starts.  Like right now, I don't feel bad. 
[00:11:30]  I'm laying down on my back and it's not that bad, but then that, that just ends immediately.  You feel a little twinge and go, oh, come on.  I thought I was done.  Yeah.  Well, before we let you go, uh, Sam did a backstage with ONA and the only reason I'm  playing this is because it's Lydia.  After her appearance on the show yesterday, she analyzed me, you and Jimmy.  Oh no.  So let's see.  I haven't heard this.  You haven't heard it.  Jimmy hasn't heard it.  So we're going to hear it for the first time. 
[00:12:00]  I've heard it.  Did you really hear it?  No.  By acting.  And now backstage with ONA, here is primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts and Lydia, the middle school therapist who regularly calls into the  ONA show, stopped by to meet the guys in person.  She ended up yapping for over an hour and we grabbed her after her appearance to find  out what she thought of the guys.  Lydia, now that you've met the guys in person and you've had, you know, a lengthy conversation 
[00:12:30]  with them, what's your analysis of Opie, Anthony, and Jim?  I think they make an excellent team together, but boy, are those guys fucked up.  What are their problems individually?  Like what's Opie's issue?  Opie's probably the hardest one to figure out because on the surface he has the most  normal looking life.  Uh, but I think everyone knows about Opie's anger issues.  I mean, he is the one who told me to, uh, suck a big black dick when I suggested psychotherapy.  So you think he's harboring a lot of, uh, issues? 
[00:13:00]  I guess growing up in a family so big it must be hard to be heard.  So he's certainly figured out his way to be heard by millions of people every day.  After filling us in on Opie's anger, Lydia confided with us that she was worried about  his co-host, Anthony Cumia.  You and Anthony got into some stuff.  What's your, uh, analysis of Anthony now?  You know, I think that Anthony's a great guy, but I do really worry about him.  I was very serious about that, all joking aside.  I worry about him isolating himself. 
[00:13:30]  I worry about him identifying with the aggressor.  I know he was beat as a child.  I know that's why he likes guns and control.  And I just sort of worry about what's going to happen over at Casa Cumia one day.  Do you think the story of Anthony could end in tragedy?  I hope and pray not.  And after all this time, she struggled to get to the root of Jim Norton.  What do you think's going on with Jim?  Jesus, I don't even know where to start with Jimmy.  He's got well-documented sexual issues.  Do you have any ideas where those might come from? 
[00:14:00]  I don't know.  You know, I think that Jimmy really feels pretty bad inside about who he is.  And he's working that out.  When you want someone to pee on you, you know, you want someone to pee all over you for a reason.  So he's the typical sad clown, laughing on the outside but crying on the inside?  That's a nice way to put it, Sam.  Thanks a lot.  Wow, Lydia.  Thanks for reminding us what a tragic and pathetic group of people we are.  Oh, well.  Back to abortion jokes.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been... 
[00:14:30]  Backstage with ONA.  Wow.  By the way, to answer Lydia's question, the reason you asked someone to pee all over you is because you're thirsty.  Jesus.  Yeah, I just feel thirsty.  Those backstage...  I love them.  They're really good, man.  I like that a lot.  The piano music really made that really sensitive, serious piano music.  Fuck, she's got a sense of humor, too.  Well, Opie told me to suck on a pig like that. 
[00:15:00]  Boy, that stuck with her, didn't it?  Yeah, it sure did.  Do you think?  You know what, though?  Oh, the picture of her tits doing very well on my Twitter.  Yeah, of course.  Now let's talk about the shrink that needed fucking breast implants and drinks like a fish.  Yeah.  Yeah, Sam, get that mic in front of us.  We'll do a backstage about Lydia and her issues.  Yeah, who emasculates her husband.  Oh, who over there?  Oh, he just sells these things that clip hairs.  She has no idea what he does.  She doesn't care.  She has no idea.  She knows every fucking school she ever went to by heart and everything. 
[00:15:30]  And meanwhile, her husband sells something that has to do with clipping pubic hair.  The poor cuckold Gary.  You think he's cuckold?  I think there's something going on there.  How many times has he just watched?  How many times has he just watched?  Of course he has.  He's watched Lydia take Opie's advice.  Those tits are made for fucking.  She was a lot hotter than I.  I knew she was going to be sexy, though.  I don't know how I knew it.  Maybe because when she said, I'm okay, I just kind of had a feeling that she was going to be definitely attractive. 
[00:16:00]  She definitely is hotter than I thought.  But as I looked at her, I feel like she might have dirty gums.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't get that impression.  Maybe she does.  I didn't look close enough.  I didn't actually look above the neck.  I couldn't get past the fact that she might have dirty gums.  It does seem to have farsitis.  She has to just keep everything clean all the time.  She can't keep up with the cleaning.  Does she smoke? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  I swear that's all I was thinking.  Dirty gums.  She didn't have bad breath or nothing.  No, she didn't smell.  But I bet you she's going through a lot of floss and she's scrubbing and cleaning and trying to just keep ahead of the whole thing.  Full-time job.  Yeah.  I don't even know why I thought that, but that's what came to mind.  Look at those tits.  Or a hubby just sits there and watches.  I think I took a perfect cleavage shot.  You really did.  That was like if you were selling that shirt online.  That would be the tits you should model it in. 
[00:17:00]  Well, they said she was wearing a...  What's the word at?  That Rorsch...  That psycho word.  No, that stupid word where you look at the blobs.  Rorschach.  What?  Rorschach?  Oh, Rorschach.  Rorschach.  Yeah.  They said she was wearing a Rorschach test because her dress has the blobs.  All right.  Did you see this face transplant guy?  Mm-hmm.  It is ridiculous.  Just leave him without a face at that point.  It's a... 
[00:17:30]  This guy stared in wonder and told the doctor who performed the operation that he couldn't  believe he looked so much like he used to.  That's shit.  Really?  What the fuck was this guy?  Is he going back on his ship and heading to Mars again?  I mean...  I don't know if he said...  He said his face was disfigured in June of 05.  The guy fell onto the electrified third rail at the Boston subway station.  He lost his nose, upper lip, cheeks, the roof of his mouth, as well as muscle, bone, 
[00:18:00]  and nerves.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  He fell on the third rail with his face.  How drunk was he?  I don't know.  You got to ask.  Was he drunk?  Why didn't they kill him?  How did they just zap out half his mouth?  What a tough guy.  Do you bounce when you hit the third rail?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  He must have looked like a fly flying into one of those fucking things in the backyard.  And then his face is gone. 
[00:18:30]  He said he looks the same as he used to look, but he looks silly with his hair and his little  hat on.  Yeah, and that little jaw.  He looks like the spy versus spy guys.  I don't know if we said the line on the air, but the first thing I thought of was he looked  like Greedo from Star Wars.  Yeah, from Star Wars.  What a creepy looking guy.  Greedo.  You know what, though?  They're figuring out this transplant thing.  Yeah.  Are they?  Really?  No, I mean, the first couple heart transplants didn't go too well either. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And now that thing is a piece of cake.  This is exactly face-off with John Travolta, you know, and Nicolas Cage.  Yeah, it is, because you're looking and you're going, would you please just take that face  off?  Right now, they're still on the fucking hammer the face on with nails stage.  You didn't read the best line of the story, Jim.  The hospital did not charge Mackey for the operation, which cost about $200,000.  Wow.  So I think they're even saying, oh, fuck.  It's on the house.  You know what?  This one's on us.  They're saying they donated their time to this guy. 
[00:19:30]  The face is on the house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poor Ant.  That's terrible.  Are you still going to miss Obie's birthday bash?  We have cake and stuff?  No, there's nothing planned.  I know it.  Why not?  How about a cupcake?  I know it.  There's nothing planned for me.  The idea of eating cake right now is not sitting well.  Yeah.  I'd be able to write happy birthday on top of the cake and chocolate fudge ice.  Or blow the candle out with just like a little stomach bile. 
[00:20:00]  You know what?  Lydia's really concerned about your isolation, but I was thinking about that yesterday, for  real.  And it's like if Anthony, it comes out of this, and it's really simple.  If Anthony's happy doing what he does, then shouldn't that be the only thing that matters  for real?  Yeah.  I know.  I don't know.  And isolation is a weird word.  I mean, there are people around in my life.  Yeah.  I'm not completely isolating myself. 
[00:20:30]  I just think the general public are assholes and don't want to deal with them.  That's pretty much it.  If you don't want to be married again, if you don't want to have kids and all that, and  if you want to party hard, as long as you're happy, that's where I'm at with my life.  As long as the person's happy, whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Why are they smart to live like everybody else?  Yeah, exactly.  Good fucking theory.  Well, what's, I mean, what's the end game?  Yeah.  You know, a lot of people.  The end game for everybody.  A lot of people, you try to make them like everyone else, and they're miserable because 
[00:21:00]  they don't want to live that way.  Yeah.  We're individuals, man.  You were the smart one of the three, though.  You were smart enough to eat at a place that was just going to ruin your stomach and you  could stay home and relax.  Yeah, I love your timing.  Your timing's perfect.  It's impeccable, isn't it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Before we let you go, this story just has to be read.  Porn star blows world record bid. 
[00:21:30]  Porn star, do you know this sexy Cora?  Let me see her.  I don't know.  That's a hot name.  That was Phil Rizzuto's wife's name.  Cora, that's right.  Not sexy, though.  No.  Porn star, sexy Cora, bit off more than she could chew when she tried to break the oral  sex world record for a new blue movie.  Blonde Cora.  What is this story in?  What?  What paper is this story in?  I don't know.  I think it comes from overseas.  Wow, wee. 
[00:22:00]  Look at that.  Oh, okay.  She's a very...  What's covering up her asshole there, Dan?  She has something inside of it.  That, my friend, is a butt plug.  Oh, I thought they were trying to, like, keep it clean for the kids.  They're like, well, the kids can't see the asshole.  She's a pretty plump vag, a nice tattoo.  She's sexy, man.  Well, listen to this one.  Blonde Cora, real name Carolyn Berger, had aimed to service 200 punters.  What's a punter?  I don't know, unless there's a whole bunch of football teams in Germany right now.  In Hamburg, Germany.  But she was forced to call off the bid. 
[00:22:30]  Ready for this?  When she collapsed after reaching her 75th man and was rushed to the hospital with breathing  difficulties.  That is fucking hilarious.  She was blowing guys to the point she couldn't breathe anymore.  I know.  She thought she could get oxygen out of that thing.  The 21-year-old star is apparently...  Dope.  The snorkel dummy.  On police bail for filming sex scenes for another porno in a family park in broad daylight.  Oh, I remember reading about this one.  No, I don't think it's the same one.  Oh, it's not the same one?  I don't think so, no. 
[00:23:00]  That was a trend for a while where these porn stars were going to, like, you know, where  the swing sets and the little kid parks and having sex, you know, before the kids got  there.  My Uncle Paul.  I know.  We got there too early.  Anthony, when you was a little boy, you always had trouble with your backside.  I remember your father used to call me to come over and help you.  From Sam on it.  Hey, this girl, by the way, the last line makes me laugh.  She's facing indecency charges after the outraged family called the cops. 
[00:23:30]  When the cops showed up, her semi-naked co-stars, they had to be rounded up as they fled, including  one who broke his wrist as he tripped over his trousers.  Fucking great.  The guy's got half a rod.  He's getting blown.  The cops show up.  Like, one minute you're getting blown, and the next you got fucking dirt on your knees  and a broken wrist.  It just stinks.  You're trying to do that shuffle run with your pants, run your ankles, big rods.  You trip and you get, like, dirt on your knees, and the tip of your cock bends back when you  slams him. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, we're getting some mind knowledge.  Punter is a UK name for a John.  Oh.  So there you go.  We learned something today.  We certainly did.  All right.  Go back to shit.  Yeah, I'm gurgling a bit here.  You're going to be up for a while.  Maybe we'll call you back with a little more radio.  All righty.  All right, Anthony.  We all know that call will go unanswered.  Yeah, no kidding.  Who do you think you're kidding?  Ring.  Ring.  Hi, this is Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  Ring.  Ring.  Anthony's going to go fucking pound his pud, right, Ant?  Yes.  It makes you feel better.  He's going to hang up the phone and go, was that believable?  You think they bought into it?  Did they buy it?  Well, Ant's obviously, I think he's probably actually just shitting.  I have a theory.  I think there's so much going on for my birthday tomorrow that he really just needs more time  to prepare for this big pass.  I need more time to decorate and get everything ready for Opie's big birthday bag.  Well, I think when he called, he was actually making the cake filling. 
[00:25:00]  Why is there lima bean skin on the top of my cake?  I don't understand how shit can be so hot.  That's what I say.  You're hot shit.  How does the temperature go up like that?  It's amazing.  This is the first year where I really believe I'm going to have a good birthday.  I can't wait what it is.  I think it might be something going on at Ant's house.  That's my feeling.  The big 4-0 should always be a special one. 
[00:25:30]  That's right, my friend.  Yeah.  That's right.  So, well, then I have a lot to look forward.  No, I have a lot to look forward to next year, then.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  39 again.  I tell that joke sometimes.  It gets lofts and lofts.  Except I always go a year older than I really am.  Boo.  Boo.  All right.  We're going to set up the uncomfortable phone call from yesterday.  So, Lydia was in.  She was giving advice to everybody. 
[00:26:00]  I think we've got to do that again.  We've got to get her in here, talk about her alcoholism for a little longer, and then have  her field some phone calls.  Because some of the phone calls were really, really good.  And the fact that it was an uncomfortable moment, and the fact that Ant did that, I was like,  I turned away.  If you can't see this side of the studio, I actually moved the mic away from me.  I was ashamed.  I faced the fucking TVs and just giggled.  I just giggled.  That was fucking funny, man.  Yeah, I looked at Jim.  He wasn't laughing, but he was chuckling and could not look at anybody in the room. 
[00:26:30]  I was beyond laughing.  I was shaking uncontrollably.  I mean, I really was laughing, but it was beyond just giggling.  I was shaking laughing so hard.  And it wasn't that the guy's story was funny.  I could not believe you had just done that.  It was a complete wrongness of the whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  Well, completely.  It sort of built, too.  So it was like it was bad at first, and then it just got worse because I started getting  more ideas. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, it was a great time to be creative.  Yeah, exactly.  More ideas to crush this guy's soul.  Jesus.  Look, I think the guy, I think, took it in stride.  He knows he's calling this silly show, and he was okay.  He was a fan.  Maybe we'll see.  I don't know.  Maybe that guy could call, and then we'll see if that's exactly what he was thinking.  As the sound of it, as it got worse and worse, I just, listening to it in the replay made  me laugh just as hard.  Maybe he works at Poco Loco. 
[00:27:30]  All right, man, we're going to set that up, and maybe we'll call you back.  All right.  Just to leave you messages.  Yeah.  Yes.  Anthony Cumia, live from the bowl today.  Live from the churl.  Bye, sweetie.  By the way, not one flush in the last half hour.  We're a little suspicious.  No, no.  We're a bit suspicious.  I've been laying down.  It's feeling better, but I, you know, I'm gurgling.  He's been laying in bed.  I don't know how to stand up.  Are you just shitting in bed like a cancer patient?  Yeah, I have a bedpan. 
[00:28:00]  I was completely dressed, had all my fucking clothes on, everything ready to go.  I was walking out the door.  I was fucking leaving to go there, and oof.  You think he's just laying in his bed with his thin veal legs?  Yeah.  Just shaking.  No way.  Just shivering.  I would have been a wreck.  Anthony just shivering in bed right now.  His shitty fucking quarter body suntan.  His horrendous sunburn. 
[00:28:30]  I'd like to do this.  His tiny veal-like legs.  I appreciate your assessment of me today.  While you're sitting there shaking on the bowl, I like to turn the air conditioner on  so you get the chills.  Oh, dude, totally.  Repeatedly slap your fucking forearm while you're sunburned.  Dude, I turned to thermostat.  It's now on 67 degrees.  I can't get it cold enough in this room.  Oh, you're hot.  I need it to be freezing cold in here.  Oh, my God.  I'd rather have the heat on when I'm in that state. 
[00:29:00]  No, because then I'll sweat and fucking, ugh.  Just laying.  For some reason, you feel a little cleaner when it's cold than if you're sweating.  That's all I need is sweat running down a fucking chapped asshole.  I can picture you right now lying on your side, like, naked below the waist, and your legs  are together, shivering, and your fucking flu bag is stuck back between your legs like  a tail.  Holy shit. 
[00:29:30]  Like, your fucking flu balls are wrapping over your leg.  It's, like, hanging out behind you and in front of you.  Ow.  Like a giant, fleshy fruit roll-up.  I'd like to sink my teeth into it.  A detective fruit roll-up with two air bubbles in it.  All right.  Let us play this very uncomfortable phone call from yesterday.  Goodbye, sweetie.  And we'll check in with you.  Let's do that.  All right, man.  Take it easy, guys. 
[00:30:00]  All right, Ant.  All right.  Thank you for the birthday wish, by the way.  That was awesome.  Oh, happy birthday.  All right.  There it goes, Ant.  Here's the uncomfortable phone call from yesterday.  We'll continue for now.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim, whatever.  You want to go real serious?  Oh, my God.  You want to go real serious?  You want to end here?  Yeah, let's go with the awful.  Hello.  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Joe from Long Island.  Hey, Joe.  How are you? 
[00:30:30]  I'm okay.  Mike, I was hearing your discussion, and I'm divorced seven years.  I had two children.  My 17-year-old daughter five years ago died in a car accident because my ex-wife told her  that I would not put her through college.  And my 19-year-old son doesn't talk to me today.  What do I do?  Well, a little detail.  So the 17-year-old daughter killed herself with a car?  No, no, no.  She didn't kill herself. 
[00:31:00]  She was on the way home from a job.  Right.  Because she took a job because my ex-wife told her that I wouldn't pay for her to go  to college.  And on the way home from that job one night, she was killed in a car accident.  Oh, man.  First off, let me let you off the hook.  Your daughter's death is not your fault.  I know that it's not my fault.  I grieve my daughter's death.  But I still, it hurts terribly that my ex-wife would actually say this to a child. 
[00:31:30]  It's hard to believe that someone you once loved could hate you so much, to be so cruel.  Well, like I said, it was all about having a boyfriend and money and getting everything  that she wanted, which includes this.  It sounds like this is still so fresh for you like it happened yesterday.  I'm divorced since 2002, and my daughter died two months after our divorce. 
[00:32:00]  You can't bring your daughter back.  There's nothing you can do about that except to let go of the guilt.  Holy shit.  For the first time ever, I am so uncomfortable.  Yeah, well, I've let go of the fact that my daughter died, you know, needlessly, and  I grieve her.  And I also forgave my ex-wife for what she did, even though she doesn't believe it.  I wrote her a letter telling her that.  Yeah.  Have you tried to talk to your son? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, he talks to me.  Let's see.  You got money?  You got money?  But other than, you know, asking for money or for medical.  It doesn't go any further than that. 
[00:33:00]  It's hard to hear this stuff.  I think you hear that the boys are having a little trouble hearing this stuff.  Yeah, I know that they are, but that's okay.  I understand their motives.  You have to try and reach out to your son in any way.  No, he's dead.  Yeah, I try to reach out to him, but he's very non-cooperative.  Keep trying.  You can't control how he reacts.  All you can do is control your attempts. 
[00:33:30]  True.  That way, if God forbid you died tomorrow, you knew you did everything in your power to  make that relationship better.  Are you kidding me?  My son tells me he wouldn't come to my funeral.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  He will have to live with that grief and lack of closure with you, sir, but you don't have  to live with that.  You do everything you can to make things right and know that you've done everything you can. 
[00:34:00]  No one can do more than that.  Okay.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Good luck, sir.  Sounds like a tough situation.  Thank you very, very much, and have a good day, boys.  Oh, take it easy.  Sorry about your loss.  Got it, man.  Still going to be okay.  I am, uh, I've never actually been grateful to not have a sound clip machine. 
[00:34:30]  So mean.  Wow.  Oh, God.  I didn't do anything.  Funny, but man.  Checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  I was just hanging out with Jay Thomas, a radio legend.  I haven't met him.  Broadcasting down the hall here at Sirius XM.  And you know what?  I walked in.  I go, hey, Jay.  Never met him before.  I go, you were an influence on my little radio career. 
[00:35:00]  I was in high school, and he was a morning guy here in New York for a station called 99X.  And he was doing some very, very different stuff.  And it piqued my interest.  So he was one of the guys that I kind of, like, listened to.  Is he on the morning or no?  He's on right now, yeah.  Now we've got to kick his ass and get more, you know, listeners than him.  But still, gave him a little respect.  Now we crush him.  It's Opie and Jimmy today. 
[00:35:30]  Ants on the bowl with explosive diarrhea.  Instant feedback.  We got friends.  He writes, Jimmy, maybe you can help me out with this.  Can you please give a happy birthday shout-out to my husband, Corbett?  It would make his day.  Many happy birthday, Corbett.  Many more.  I hope Corbett steps into an empty elevator shaft and paralyzes himself on his birthday.  What did Corbett do to you?  I just, his name stinks.  It is a bad name. 
[00:36:00]  Fucking creep.  It is.  I was hoping you were going to sing him the special Jimmy Norton happy birthday song.  I'm not singing to that zero.  I hope they go to blow his candles out and he has a little gas on his face.  And he fucking needs a face transplant.  And he looks like this fucking creep in the paper today.  Spies, Corbett.  Poor Corbett.  All right.  Sam.  Sam Roberts in studio.  Got an exclusive interview with Vince McMahon.  That's right.  You guys said you wanted it. 
[00:36:30]  And I got it.  It was a private press conference.  No fans.  Just legitimate members of the press.  Like me and E-Rock.  And you're getting lazy with your Twitter because I, Opie, Opie Radio on Twitter, was very quick to show the Twitter nation a picture of you and Vince McMahon.  It was on WWE.com.  It still is on WWE.com.  No, no, no.  It's on my Twitter.  I mean it's on Twitter slash Opie Radio.  And Sam gives me the link.  I'm like, who needs a link when you can take a picture of your computer? 
[00:37:00]  Come on.  That's true.  You're very innovative.  Yeah.  So how did it go down?  You got to make this interesting for the people that could give a shit about your stupid wrestling, by the way.  Well, this should.  I mean.  Put your hand down, Danny.  Danny, you're one of them, right?  Definitely.  You could give a shit.  Wrestling was really cool back in like 1997.  It was.  What were the golden years for the WWE?  1997 through 2000.  Yeah, that's about right. 
[00:37:30]  Yep.  That's when we were all in.  All in.  That was the number one golden era for pro wrestling.  And then what happened was, you know, the PC police got under Vince's skin kind of with the advertisers and stuff.  And then he had to kind of move away from some of that crazy edgy shit he was doing.  Right.  Well, now they're focusing on getting the kids involved.  They're trying to get the kid audience again.  Well, you're perfect.  No, no.  I'm older.  No.  What are you, 17, 18 now?  I'm 25.  It'll be 26 in September. 
[00:38:00]  Sam brought up a really good point, though, about wrestling, where, you know, wrestling grows with their audience to a point until everybody kind of drops off.  And then they have to just start from stage one again, which is recruit the kids.  So, you know, they got edgy, edgy, edgy, edgy.  It got to the point where they couldn't be any more edgy and raw, and they just kind of have to now reset and just hook that kid audience again to just build it up all over again.  Right.  They'll get edgy again in, like, between three and five years, they'll be crazy again.  Is The Rock still wrestling?  No, The Rock is actually a movie actor. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, really?  Yes, he's in Hollywood now.  Does he do well in Hollywood?  He does all right.  Yeah, he's had a few movies.  Well, at least they got Stone Cold Steve Austin, so that's good.  Actually, Stone Cold no longer wrestles.  He has not wrestled in years.  What?  He's in the Hall of Fame, as a matter of fact.  What is he doing?  He's just sitting at home drinking beers.  Then he should be wrestling.  No, it's fake anyway, so get back in the wrestling room.  Well, I don't know.  The movie career didn't work out.  Get back in the squared circle.  He's done what he had to do in the squared circle.  At least we got mankind, so, you know. 
[00:39:00]  Well, technically.  Vince is in good shape.  Well, Mick Foley works for the competition.  What?  He's the TNA world champion now.  So who the fuck do they got?  Worth watching.  Yeah, they did.  They got John Cena.  They got Randy Orton, Triple H, Batista, The Undertaker.  And why hasn't Triple H lost any muscle tone in the last 15 years?  Because he works out like a fiend.  That's a bit creepy.  This man, he's all business.  Yeah, is he?  I saw him yesterday.  He recognized me in Iraq. 
[00:39:30]  Of course he did.  Specifically me.  When you guys stalk him.  Of course you guys do.  Iraq and me sat down.  I love how these guys get excited.  They get recognized.  But the guys that are doing the recognizing are recognizing for a whole different, you know,  reason.  And that's what Danny said.  Because they really look at you as stalking.  I'm sure that chick that was stalking Letterman.  Right.  I'm all excited when Letterman.  Yeah, I'm sure Letterman recognized her a lot.  Iraq and me sat down at the press conference.  We were waiting for it to start.  And then all of a sudden I just heard on the side of me somebody say, Jesus Christ, you 
[00:40:00]  guys come to everything.  And I turn and look to my left and there's Triple H.  You should, well, Jimmy, I got to get you involved in this because Sam's obsession with  wrestling, I learned recently, is really creepy.  No.  Are you allowed to talk about what you were telling me about your little on the side?  Yeah.  Why don't you tell Jimmy what you used to do until your parents finally shut you down?  Oh.  Well, I was a big wrestling tape trader. 
[00:40:30]  Like a huge, I was on the internet.  I had like a website and everything.  Like all throughout high school, I was bootlegging wrestling tapes and trading them.  I have like, I still have all the tapes.  How many tapes do you have?  Like boxes.  I just have closets full of boxes of tapes.  Thousands and thousands.  Thousands of tapes.  I had everything.  And this was before the internet was really, no, no, you were doing it with the internet.  I keep forgetting you're a fucking kid.  Yeah.  Fuck yourself.  Fuck yourself in the ass.  It was when the internet.  You old dick, you cocksucker. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  The black one.  It was, but yeah, I mean, I had everything from every country, every era from the 70s  to the 90s.  And so someone would go, hey, do you have like a stone cold fighting in Japan, April, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  And then he would dig through his tapes, get it.  Make a dub.  I wouldn't have to dig through the tapes because I kept, I had to start keeping an inventory  list.  A lot of portions.  Good, smart.  Yeah.  What was the hard one to get that you had?  Hard one?  I mean, I had a lot of very difficult ones.  A lot of TV shows from the like 80s, like territorial TV shows. 
[00:41:30]  Like, because in the 80s, wrestling was territorial, so it was always on local cable.  Yeah.  It wasn't national.  But so I started collecting stuff from Dallas and the South and Mid-Atlantic.  Was there anything you really wanted to get that you just couldn't get your hands  on?  No.  No, I started collecting like satellite feeds.  Like they start, they send out for shows that are taped, they send out a satellite feed  to the truck.  And some people with satellite dishes in their house can actually pick up the feed and get  it live instead of the taped version.  And you can hear the commentators talking during the commercial breaks, like talking about 
[00:42:00]  to each other off camera.  And you can, anything they edit for TV, you get raw and live.  So I started collecting those and those were kind of tough to come by.  But I have a few of those.  Yeah.  So, and then he would go to the post office every day with a big, cute stack of, you know,  tapes.  I started, I had to buy mailers, like padded mailers and wholesale.  Because I was doing some, a little bit.  Nothing to scream about. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was more trading and just amassing the biggest collection I could possibly.  Hold on, Sam.  I got a big star wishing me a happy birthday.  I don't know who this is, though.  Hello?  Hello, this is a comic 630.  Fucking, who did Anthony get for his birthday?  He got fucking.  He got Christopher Lloyd.  And I get fucking Rich Foss.  That's right.  It doesn't matter.  It's just getting that call.  And the uncomfortableness of me even calling just to say happy birthday, it's almost like 
[00:43:00]  being touched by somebody.  Oh, is this pathetic?  I really was hoping for a lot this year, too.  I think my girl's going to take care of my birthday this year.  I think I'm going to have a good one.  What do you think?  I'm going to have a good birthday.  What?  She'll just wake up.  You'll say happy birthday.  She'll give you a kiss and a gift, and I'll be it.  No, I expect way more than that.  I expect trips and things to blow out and good gifts. 
[00:43:30]  Although I already told her what she got me, so she's not happy with me.  You know what?  It's early, though.  If I call early, it can only get better.  You think?  Yeah.  What are you kidding me?  By the end of the show, people like Bobby Kelly will be.  Did you survive your whole password ordeal or what?  It was a complete nightmare.  I mean, not a complete nightmare.  You know what?  They were actually good.  The guy gave me the Twitter back, but I had to have my daughter, the middle one, 
[00:44:00]  clean up all the, try to get all the gay stuff off of my Facebook.  My one daughter emails me on Facebook or whatever and says,  is there something you want to tell me?  And I didn't realize.  I didn't even look, but it was all these gay ads, these websites I like to visit and stuff.  And I go, look, I mean, someone hacked into my Facebook thing. 
[00:44:30]  But, yeah, there is something I'd like to tell you.  So I had to take care of that.  But, you know, whatever.  It was, I think I was cool that got to Twitter.  Then I had to switch my, was it PayPal?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Sam, so where were we?  We were talking about.  Oh, you and your illegal business.  Yeah.  Well, I wasn't, I was called.  You obviously didn't make any money off this.  Yeah.  So you would certainly not be talking about it on a radio show. 
[00:45:00]  It was called, it's not up anymore.  So I'm not actually plugging it because it doesn't exist.  Right.  But it was called RasslinTapes.com.  Yeah.  That's it, Danny.  Let me see it, Danny.  Danny found it in the archives of the Internet.  You had a nice, you had a website and everything.  Yeah.  And how they could get a hold of you.  Yeah.  I was all set up.  New, in stock now.  What was the new one on that page?  What got you out of the business?  I went to college.  A little visit from one of Vince's henchmen. 
[00:45:30]  No, I started getting worried about that.  Shut down your business.  I started getting cocky, too.  I started putting tapes on eBay.  Just thinking, oh, who cares about copyright?  And just got cease and desist from every, like, maybe eBay's not the way to go on this.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Josh.  Josh, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, Opie?  Hey, how are you, man?  I'm doing great, man.  I couldn't be better.  I got a fucking rental car yesterday, and it has that tin, and I haven't heard you guys  since little yee-me days.  The first time you're listening in a while? 
[00:46:00]  Since little yee-me.  That's the last thing I remember hearing.  Well...  And I'm up at six this morning listening.  I'm driving around in circles.  I got nowhere to go.  Dude, you got to buy the service.  It's fucking...  It's great.  It's totally uncensored.  We'll do an hour and a half without commercials sometimes.  The only problem is, because you haven't heard us in a while, you know, Anthony's voice  has changed.  What do you think of the new Anthony as far as the voice is?  I didn't notice it.  Yeah, listen.  I listened to the replay yesterday.  I didn't notice it.  Hello, sir.  What?  Hello? 
[00:46:30]  That's Anthony.  Anthony.  Well?  That's Reagan.  I'm confused.  Why are you confused?  Anthony had a little, you know, voice problem, and this is his new voice.  My voice changed.  You know, voices change.  Oh, it's Sam.  Oh.  All right.  Well...  Yeah, thanks, thanks.  Bye.  Bye, Josh.  Danny was just going through the archived webpage, and I forgot that I had, uh, I taped every  XFL game.  Did you really?  When it was on TV.  And every XFL pregame show. 
[00:47:00]  How many people were just dying for a copy of the XFL tape?  I don't know.  I just figured there'd be some value in having them, because they would probably never release  them.  Mm-hmm.  And so one day I would go through old tapes and be like, wow, look at all these old  XFL tapes.  Maybe we throw an XFL bit up on the, uh, the YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  I'll have to go through all my tapes later.  Oh, we put up, uh, Evan P. in his pants last night.  What'd you put up?  Uh, Evan P. in his pants is up on the, the YouTube, uh, my YouTube channel, Opie Radio. 
[00:47:30]  It's up there for your viewing pleasure.  It's a good one.  All right, so you talked to Vince, so there's a problem with Raw, and now he moved his Raw  from Denver to LA, because the Nuggets have a home game.  Yeah, well, basically, yeah, because he booked the arena in Denver, and it was signed and  everything, but the guy who owns, Cronky, Cronky, who runs the, uh, the arena, who owns  it, said, you can't have it here.  Then he sent out a press release, or he said, he said, here's what we'll do, Vince.  If you want the arena, you can tape Raw on Sunday and air it on Monday, and you have to 
[00:48:00]  put out this press release that's from both of us.  And Vince said, well, number one, I'm not going to tape Raw, and number two, I'm not  going to put out a press release, because Vince was already quoted in the press release when  he hadn't, like, Vince did not say anything.  So instead, Vince took the press release that they wrote, and had his own press conference,  and handed it out to us.  And made fun of it.  Yes.  It's the most bizarre thing when, uh, when you, uh, well, I can speak for Ant and I,  when the company has quotes from us, they're never our quotes. 
[00:48:30]  They usually hand you over the press release and go, well, this is what we have you guys  saying.  Like, well, how about we just say what we want to say?  Ah, well, you know, it's already written, and we're about to send this out.  We're about to push send.  So just to prove what you're, what you're saying in this press release.  But I didn't say it.  Right.  And this happens all the time.  Vince spent days talking about what a terrible businessman this guy was, and he was the  worst.  And then they put out this press release.  Can I just say that this, coming from Kroenke's people, what an asshole this guy sounds like. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  What a self-serving asshole.  Yeah.  What's in there, Jimmy?  Dude, it's, it's embarrassing.  How do you not like Vince for doing this?  He just hands it out.  Yeah, hey, look what this asshole wanted me to say.  That's exactly what he did.  Really?  God damn, I like Vince for this, yeah.  Well, what is it?  What's in there?  Sam, you might as well do it.  It's embarrassing.  All right.  So it says, uh, uh, Kroenke Sports Enterprises, whatever, they reached an agreement with World  Wrestling Entertainment, which they obviously didn't do, but this is, uh, and that they're 
[00:49:30]  going to tape Raw on Sunday.  It says, uh, we are pleased to announce that we have reached this agreement with WWE, said  KSE.  And then it had Vince McMahon, WWE chairman, quoted as saying, I would like to thank, thank  Stan Kroenke and his team and his management team for resolving this matter so quickly in  ways that allows all WWE and Nuggets fans to watch two world-class main events Sunday and  Monday.  By all accounts, Mr. Kroenke is one of the most respected professional sports team owners 
[00:50:00]  in the world.  And the professional way he and his staff good-naturedly handled this conflict gives further testament  to the type of business leader he is.  And, and Kroenke wrote that for Vince.  What?  And of course Vince would never say that.  What a self-serving asshole.  You know, it wasn't probably him, it was probably somebody who works for him, some worm that fucking  works for him.  But how would you expect Vince to say that?  That's amazing.  Let's say how to Stryker. 
[00:50:30]  Uh, Stryker.  Morning, boys.  What's up, Stryker?  Yeah, uh, Sam and Vince are leaving a few things out.  Like the fact that WWE had three events in Colorado this weekend.  Sunday they were performing in Loveland, Monday they were performing in Denver, and Tuesday  they were going to be in Colorado Springs.  Well, since they've moved to the Staples Center, they've postponed the other two events, may  not recognize the tickets that were already sold, and when they talk about, you know, taping 
[00:51:00]  raw, they were, for Monday, they were also given the option of continuing to hold the event  at the, uh, facility up in Loveland, and Vince said, no, he didn't want to do that.  And Vince has kind of left that out a little bit, and there is zero sympathy in the Denver  area for raw.  A lot of the sports talk people are saying, fuck you, WWE, we don't care if you ever come  back.  Well, that's why I think that they probably opted to just, they were smart to lead, because 
[00:51:30]  the Denver fans never would have forgiven them for that.  They really would have hated them for it, just for the arrogance of it.  But, uh, you're also competing with 17,000 people going to see a Nuggets event.  It's almost like you don't want to have to compete for tickets last minute with that.  Well, and that's just it.  None of these three events in Colorado were sold out.  And Vince has kind of left that out, too, the fact that these events weren't even totally  sold out.  But just by this press conference, this, uh, this, this press release that this horse's 
[00:52:00]  ass wanted released in Vince's name, just shows you what a self-serving boob he is.  We want to, by all accounts, Mr. Kroenke is one of the most respected, who the fuck would  say that?  He wrote it for Vince.  What a fool.  I'm going to put this out on your behalf.  That was Kroenke's deal.  He was like, here's what we'll do.  We'll let you tape on Sunday, but you also have to put out this press release.  So, of course, Vince said no.  And if you're going to cancel the Monday event in Colorado, you can't do Sunday in Colorado, 
[00:52:30]  Monday in L.A., and Tuesday in Colorado.  Economically, it makes no sense.  Yeah, but they had the chance to still perform in Colorado on Monday at a different facility,  and they refused.  Yeah, because the facility wasn't big enough to do raw.  It wasn't big enough to do TV.  Actually, it is.  Actually, it is.  How big is it, sir?  I don't remember the ticket, what the seating is, but it's the same size as the Pepsi Center.  It would be zero in print.  Well, according to what we were talking about before, that one place was too small by 13 
[00:53:00]  seats.  Thanks for bringing the jokes back.  All right, Stryker.  Thanks for the info, man.  All right.  Settle down, Stryker.  You're fucking having a panic attack.  Just relax.  You're fucking coming apart at the seams.  So, Sam got to sit down with Vince yesterday and talk.  Did he?  Yeah.  And he's on the front page of the WWE.com.  That's pretty impressive.  With the Opie and Anthony Mike flag.  Very nice.  Representing.  Representing.  Sam checks on Vince's health.  Because I haven't gotten it. 
[00:53:30]  You guys always have questions.  How did he?  Is he okay?  Because we haven't talked to him since the set fell on him.  You're asking him if he's okay after he survived the fake death plot?  No, because the set fell on him.  No, it fell around him.  He had a safe area.  I don't know.  What was that old black and white movie where, is it Charlie Chaplin?  The whole freaking facade falls down, but he's safe because he was in the doorway.  Yeah, but this wasn't one.  Anybody?  It's a very famous film clip.  Buster Keaton.  You're going with Buster Keaton, Mars. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  There you go.  Here's Sam checking on Vince's health.  We're here with Vince McMahon.  Sam, we haven't spoken to you in a while.  The first thing I want to do is get a health update because we haven't spoken to you since the set fell on you.  Oh, that's right.  Well, some people have a kryptonite.  I have a set that kind of falls on me from time to time.  But me being the man of steel that I am, I'm perfectly healthy.  Thank you.  Well, that's terrific.  And did you ever find out who might have been behind it?  That's a mystery.  And we have Mr. Fuji, who was a longtime superstar many, many years ago, who's investigating the matter. 
[00:54:30]  Why?  Oh, that's good.  That's good to hear.  Why would you have Mr. Fuji?  Why not the police?  Why does everything have to involve a wrestler?  Why don't you get the real police?  Exactly.  Right.  Mr. Fuji's got a lot of free time, so he's able to put himself 100% into it.  Isn't Mr. Fuji like 70 years old?  He's an older guy, yes.  And he's confined to a wheelchair.  There's been a rape.  We called Bob Backlund to take samples.  Well, Mr. Fuji knows wrestling, and this is a wrestling investigation, so I think it's suitable. 
[00:55:00]  So an old wrestler in a wheelchair is going to make sure the right thing is done.  Yes, Mr. Fuji.  And why is he in a wheelchair?  Because I do remember him from when I was watching wrestling.  Well, he's just an older gentleman now, and he's lost his ability to walk.  Maybe because he sacrificed his legs for the company.  And maybe now that Vince is getting older, he feels a little guilty, and he's like, you know what?  All right, we'll give him a little part in my stupid fake wrestling thing.  They also, for years, forced him to play horrible Asian stereotypes.  Right. 
[00:55:30]  All right, and the interview continues with Sam asking about Kroenke and if Vince lost.  Because Vince, in the end, had to move his event.  But onto this Stan Kroenke thing.  It's Kroensky?  It's E period.  I've never trusted anyone, by the way, with an initial for a first name.  Now I know why.  It's E period Stan Kroenke.  Kroensky.  Crappy.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  Something like that.  Good improv, Vince. 
[00:56:00]  It is good improv.  He went to the Steve School of Improv.  Yes.  Steve Crappy.  It actually works.  Yes.  Now some people are saying that because he said you can't do Raw here and you said, well, you know, it's in the contract, but now you're not, that you lost, which is not the Vince McMahon I know.  Is there something that you'll be doing this Monday night to make sure that you're obviously the winner of this battle?  Well, in the end, the WWE and Mr. McMahon always win in one form or another. 
[00:56:30]  And there will be a parody, probably a very interesting one, where Mr. McMahon's character will go one-on-one with E period Stan Kroenke.  Oh, Jesus.  They also, at the press release, because this is a serious press conference, handed out pictures that have been obviously photoshopped, believe it or not.  It said, you know, on Raw this Monday, and it was a picture of Vince McMahon, and he had a halo, and then a picture of Kroensky or whatever his name is, and he had devil horns and a devil tail.  I wonder if Vince is going to have his hiney kissed in the ring by this guy. 
[00:57:00]  You know what? I might watch for the first time in a long time.  What a smart dude Vince is.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why he's a billionaire.  He brought attention to his business.  But to make a fight with this boar in Denver, this Kroenke or Kroensky, to make that like the theme of your Monday night live show, he's a smart dude.  I just added nothing.  Well, we got more info on Mr. Foose.  I got what you were saying.  It was boring, though.  Thank God our wrestling talk continues. 
[00:57:30]  Jesus.  Lefty, PA, what do you got?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, Sam, I'm disappointed in you.  The reason Mr. Fuji was labeled by Vince is because back in the 80s, they had that old TNT skit show, and Mr. Fuji and Don Morocco did that Fuji vice.  Yes, of course.  Where he pretended he was a detective.  They had a late night style show called Tuesday Night Titans where Vince McMahon would host it and interview the wrestlers, 
[00:58:00]  and sometimes they would do skits, like Fuji Vice starring magnificent Don Morocco.  Oh, wow.  And Mr. Fuji.  It was like Miami Vice, except with Mr. Fuji and Don Morocco.  Did you all, do you think you've seen, is there a lot of wrestling stuff you haven't watched?  No.  I've seen most of it.  I've seen a lot of it.  No one will beat him in wrestling trivia.  I'll tell you that much.  I destroyed Fez three-peat.  Yeah, I don't know if you should be proud of that, but good for you.  Vince talks about the press release that we just read here on our show. 
[00:58:30]  Right, it's the same, yeah.  Now, His Camp proposed a press release that you'd put out that just complimented him and talked about what a great businessman he was.  Would you have said compliments like that about him had he given you the arena for a live Monday show?  I would never have complimented anyone like that.  If those words would have been written by me, then they would have been true, but no, I would have never done that, ever.  You know, Kronsky, Kronky, Crappy, whatever his name is, never picked up the phone, never called me, never apologized, nor did anyone in his organization. 
[00:59:00]  How many people really care about this story?  Vince McMahon is making people care.  It's all over the news.  It's all over ESPN, SportsCenter.  Yeah, but he's making people care.  I saw it on ESPN and all, but.  Yeah.  The guy just wants to get it over with and get Vince out of his hair.  He hasn't made one comment publicly.  Nothing.  Vince McMahon is just hammering him at every corner.  He won't stop.  That's all he talks about.  Vince is obsessed.  Just holding press conferences out of nowhere to talk about how much he sucks.  That a guy with a horrible name who owns the nuggets?  No one gives a shit about this guy. 
[00:59:30]  No one cares about him.  And now he's going to make someone dress up as him so he can beat him up.  Compare him with the Antichrist.  Just from fucking up a date on a calendar.  Two worthless events when you think about it.  Still starving people.  Jeez, should we wrestle or throw a ball through a hoop?  Gives a fuck.  Shit either way.  That's a great...  Now he thinks he's the devil.  That's hilarious.  Fucking Vince.  Jesus.  He's the best.  Is he?  Yes.  He really is smart, man. 
[01:00:00]  Your unbelievable interview with Vince McMahon ended with this.  This is a good interview.  Hopefully our fucking teeth get knocked out.  Do you ever see yourself doing a show at Kronsky's Arena again?  Well, yeah.  I never say never in business.  Sometimes in life, but never in business.  And if we ever do go back to the Pepsi Center in Denver, I would hope it's under different management.  All right.  And just for the record, Opie and Anthony would really love to have you in studio anytime you have any minute free in your schedule on a morning, weekday morning.  I'd love that myself. 
[01:00:30]  Thanks a lot.  Really?  See?  He's coming in, I think.  Really?  We had a mom once.  Has to be eight years ago.  Has to be.  You could almost hear him walking away as he said, I'd love that myself.  You could hear him pulling off the mic like, I'd love that myself.  Yeah.  He'd love nothing less.  Yeah.  He couldn't wait to get away from you and your ridiculous hair.  I thought he was just on his way to the studio.  He's like, I'll come right now.  He started walking towards the studio.  No.  No?  No.  I'm finally out as far as your hair goes.  I decided.  How do you figure?  My hair's at an all-time high right now.  I was hanging in there with you, bro. 
[01:01:00]  But I'm so out now.  Can you put a shower cap just over the bun part?  Yeah, I'm sure I could.  I want to see that.  I think I'm in Danny's camp now with the hair thing.  Well, then if you want to pick losing sides, pick losing sides.  I really think.  My hair is much better than yours.  No, it's not.  You have to wear a hat all the time.  It's been for quite some time.  I was in, even when you started pulling it back and it had kind of a small, what would  you call it?  Poof?  Like a little poof.  But now the poof is now two poofs, making it look kind of like mouse ears.  No. 
[01:01:30]  I'm out.  Well, you can be out if you want to, but this is the winning team.  Let's go to Ken in Iowa.  Ken.  Hi.  Do we have Ken?  Let's try that again.  Ken?  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, how's it going?  Welcome aboard, Ken.  Sam.  Hey, buddy.  This is going, I didn't go a little too far.  I mean, I was like seven years old and I was really into this stuff, but this is kind  of like still looking up to the Ninja Turtles.  It is not.  How do you figure that?  Ninja Turtles are cartoons.  Ken says online, I had all the belts, you know, because you collect the belts if you're 
[01:02:00]  into this wrestling thing.  But the problem was, he was seven years old.  But this is kind of something you just grow out of.  This is getting intense, man.  You didn't have the real belts.  Are you going to grow out of this wrestling obsession of yours, Sam?  No.  What's there to grow out of?  If this doesn't lead to a job with the WWE, then what?  You're going to be the old guy at all the wrestling shows?  I'll still be going to wrestling shows.  I'll bring the kids.  Kids will grow up.  I'll still go.  You're going to lose your girl, though. 
[01:02:30]  She loves wrestling.  She hates it.  Does she like it?  No.  She sits there and texts me the whole time while you're up there.  She texts you?  Yeah, of course.  Why?  Because she's bored.  I don't even get to text you.  You're trying to get autographs on your dumb chair, and you don't even know that she's  like...  I got Hulk Hogan on my chair.  How'd you get him?  He did a signing in Armonk at a gun store in fucking Florida.  Can we play that clip?  Does Travis have the clip?  That guy's a loser, though.  Is he?  He sounds a lot like you.  He does not. 
[01:03:00]  This guy's got the soul of every wrestling fan.  That's the E-Rock genre of wrestling fan, not the primetime Sam Roberts.  Didn't we talk to this guy on the phone?  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, he kind of knows it was douchey, but...  You know what?  I think we did.  Yeah, we did.  I don't even remember.  Why would you?  Don't act like you missed a big one, Obitz.  It wasn't exactly a fucking Obama interview.  Sam, get ready to do the live read for the WWE thing.  Okay.  Because they bought time on our show.  How cool is that after we just trashed Vince for the last half hour?  We didn't trash him. 
[01:03:30]  We talked about how cool he was.  Yeah.  I'd love to make fun of Vince, but he's fucking...  I'll say it again and bore myself.  Smart dude.  Yeah, we got it, Jim.  Makes him into the devil.  Wishes cancer on his kids.  Vince, what are you doing?  He's fucking amazing to make this interesting, though.  It was just a little oopsie, a little mistake.  Why don't we try to work this out?  Yeah.  Instead of vilifying the guy, his family, his ancestors, make Vince praise him.  What an amazing business owner.  Asshole. 
[01:04:00]  Nah, I like Vince.  I like what he did with this whole thing.  He's the bomb.  Here is the wrestling clip of all time.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I'll be...  Take it easy, man.  Thank y'all guys.  Y'all are awesome, man.  Thank you so much, Mr. Vaughn, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Take it easy, man. 
[01:04:30]  I can't listen to that without cringing.  It's so bad.  That could be the worst clip on the fucking internet.  You'll never catch me saying something like that.  Not on the air.  It'd be sad.  Just the fact that even the wrestlers are embarrassed for him.  Like, oh, you assholes.  Oh, they're just like...  Oh, God.  Take it easy, man.  Obi's been to a wrestling convention.  No.  Because they're all hanging...  No.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he did.  Obi met Terry Funk.  No.  Your stupid signing thing was going late. 
[01:05:00]  And a bunch of us were getting together for dinner or something.  Oh, we're going to be done soon.  Why don't you come down?  Where was it?  Caroline's?  Yeah.  It's like Caroline's...  Ringside Fest.  Ringside Fest.  And I show up and I had another hour to go and I'm just sitting there like, you've got  to be fucking kidding me.  Did you bump into Obi?  You thought he was in a sneaking or wrestling convention and he bumped into him?  Yeah, he was going to Terry Funk's Q&A session.  Yeah, that's what I was going to.  He had his notepad with questions already.  I'd love to go to that.  The first thing I'd say is, who the fuck are you?  I've never heard of Terry Funk.  What?  I don't know who he is.  He's from Amarillo, Texas. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, all right.  You should ask Terry Funk.  Do you know where Terry Funk is?  Because I'm here.  Exactly.  What's his real name?  What's the WWE thing?  Do it proud there, Sam.  Me and WWE will help you through it.  Classics on demand.  Gain access to the entire video library of Royal Wrestling Entertainment.  I don't need a copy for this.  For those of you that haven't bought it from Sam illegally.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  What I'm telling you is...  So wait, you're in business with the WWE now?  No, there's no buying tapes for me illegally.  There's no reason to... 
[01:06:00]  Self-addressed stamped envelopes to you?  No.  I'm nothing to do with this.  I'm just a watcher.  It's classic wrestling tapes.  This is you.  This is your business.  It's not tapes.  That daddy made you shut down.  There's nothing like that happening.  What I'm saying is, WWE Classics on demand.  And if you've ever wanted to go into the WWE tape library, which Jim Norton has always said  that's one of his dreams.  It just seems like it's an impossible thing to do.  Like, you'd love to go into the tape library and just rift through them for hours.  Or to be sifted.  I don't know.  Look. 
[01:06:30]  You can do that.  It's all WWE stuff.  ECW stuff.  WCW stuff.  Stuff from the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.  Everything on this channel.  And it's all perfect quality.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You just piqued my interest.  70s?  Everything.  Who were some of those big wrestlers in the 70s?  Coconut Willie, who I named my penis after.  Gorilla Monsoon.  Gorilla Monsoon.  It's not even.  All right.  I'll ask you one.  Yeah.  Do they have the Andre the Giant match where he took on three very short wrestlers? 
[01:07:00]  They weren't officially midgets, but they made sure they were short.  And at the end of the match, he stacked them up and sat on them.  They do a theme.  Like, every month has a theme.  And I think a couple months ago, like, this month is Latino Legends because it's May.  Cinco de Mayo.  But a couple months ago, they did Giants.  Like, Giants of the Ring.  And they had all kinds of Andre the Giant matches.  Big John Studd matches.  Everything.  Every big man.  And they're featuring them as well as they have complete episodes of old TV.  How big was Big John Studd? 
[01:07:30]  He was like 6'10".  Oh, he was that big?  Was he really 6'10"?  More or less.  They all, like, bumped up their heights a little bit, though.  He was like 6'10".  But they have complete episodes of TV, the old ECW TV shows, old Raws, old Nitros.  Complete.  Not just, like, matches.  The whole episode.  When I was living in Rochester, I was ringside for a wrestling event.  And Andre the Giant, you can't even begin to tell people how big this fucking guy was.  7'4".  But on TV, you don't understand because he's in the ring with guys that are relatively, not relatively, they're bigger than the average man. 
[01:08:00]  But then you put him next to just average guys.  It's ridiculous.  And there were flies.  I've told this story a bunch on the air that just followed Andre around the entire match the entire time he was in this arena.  Flies.  Like, he was a horse.  Well, they have Legends of the Roundtable, which is, like, an original series where Legends of Wrestling sit around and talk about whatever wrestling theme it is.  And they've done a show just about Andre the Giant.  And people just sharing stories of, like, Andre sitting in a bar and drinking 100 beers in a sitting. 
[01:08:30]  No.  Yeah.  He was ridiculous.  His reputation for drinking was beyond all others.  He used to just get new guys.  You knew that too, Dan.  He used to just...  119 is actually the number I heard.  It's a legendary story.  Yeah.  Actually, I heard a story about...  Wait, 119 beers?  Yes.  In one sitting, yeah.  How many hours?  Is that a weekend?  Is that...  No, it's in one.  It's not like a 24-hour marathon.  It's like he went to a bar and drank 119 beers.  Well, he didn't actually go to a bar.  He had one in his basement. 
[01:09:00]  Get it?  Anthony?  There's actually some classic stories about...  He was obviously in the classic 80s film, The Princess Bride.  Yeah.  And production had to be halted a few times because Andre the Giant was notorious for taking  the crew out and getting hammered with them.  So they had to keep him away from the cast and crew because they knew if people started  going out with Andre, they were never going to get this movie done.  They said that on the Legends of Wrestling show, they said that he used to take young guys 
[01:09:30]  who were starting out and they'd be like, oh, Andre the Giant wants to take me out for  drinks and just drink them under the table so they were in no shape to compete the next  day.  They just ruined careers.  I had no idea.  I didn't know Andre was a drunk.  He was a monster.  But dude, a guy that big and heavy, he was so much body mass.  I mean, a fucking...  119 beers, though.  That's a lot.  Oh, come on.  But there are alcoholics.  You think there are guys that can sit down and...  A regular guy can sit down and drink two cases, two and a...  You know, that's 24.  How many is in a case?  I don't even...  It's 48 beers.  I mean... 
[01:10:00]  How much is in a case?  24?  You've got to be a real drunk to drink today.  24, right?  I used to...  That's like four cases.  I was going to brag about my...  What's wrong with me?  Why?  So I...  So I...  Do you know what I was about to say?  I don't know.  I'm sure it's...  What?  Me and my...  Ugh.  Me and my two best friends, like around the senior year of high school or the year  after, we would split a case before we went out.  That's what I was going to say.  I'm glad.  Exactly.  That's a lot of fucking alcohol for a young man. 
[01:10:30]  Eight beers each.  Andre the Giant would just destroy you.  Yeah.  He's talking about Andre the Giant.  Andre the Giant.  Yeah.  119.  And I'm about to try to relate to Andre with my, I'm splitting a case with two other  guys before I go out story.  Ugh.  But like speaking...  Like when the Iron Sheik was in here and getting drunk and pissing on himself, I said,  what's happened to this guy?  And I went home and turned on WWE Classics On Demand and I could watch when the Iron Sheik  was actually like muscular and in his prime.  He was great in the ring.  He was fantastic. 
[01:11:00]  Did we do the live read?  We're good?  Let's tag it.  WWE Classics On Demand costs less than $8 a month for most cable providers.  To subscribe to WWE Classics, call your local cable provider or 1-888-WWE-CLASSICS and  sign up today.  I don't even watch...  Sorry.  I don't even watch wrestling.  I'm honestly...  I'm looking at the read as he's doing it.  It's like, fuck it.  That's a great idea, man.  Yeah.  It really is.  I thought we were just going to go, whatever, just read this dumb thing and we'll move on.  But it piqued my interest.  I want to check this out.  Was Andre ever married? 
[01:11:30]  I don't think he was.  He didn't have any kids?  No, I don't think so.  He used to have to sit because he was such a big dude.  He used to have to sit on the floor sometimes in planes when they didn't have a first class  or whatever because there was nothing built for a guy who was 7'4".  Do you think his back just ached all the time?  Yeah, he was in constant pain.  And his knees just gave out on him eventually.  Do you remember that match where Andre would beat up the three guys and just pile them  one on top of the other in the middle of the ring and just sit on top of them like  it was a throne?  He had a ranch. 
[01:12:00]  He was big on this farm.  He had a ranch that he loved going to.  Very cool.  Another interesting fact.  We got a birthday call coming in.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  Hello?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday?  Hello?  Hi.  Call him to say happy birthday to Opie.  I don't know.  Who's this?  Hello?  We don't...  I don't know who it is, though.  What do you say, guy? 
[01:12:30]  Come on, Opie.  It's the Bear Man.  Oh!  No way!  We're sitting here listening to you guys.  It's the Bear Man and Keith, by the way.  Keith's on the phone.  So we're sitting here listening to you guys talking about Andre the Giant.  Yeah.  Wait, I gotta explain.  Bear Man.  Oh, wow.  I got Bear Man stories.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Good morning, Bear Man.  Yeah, this Bear Man.  Thank God there's not many Spuds Buckley tapes out there, Bear Man. 
[01:13:00]  Lord knows I've been looking.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of people are looking.  But I worked with Bear Man in Buffalo.  I was just a nobody doing overnights.  And Bear Man was the king of Buffalo Radio.  And then moved back to Allentown.  And he's been working with Keith ever since.  How long now for you guys?  Well, we've been together here for 20 years.  God damn it.  I haven't seen you.  Are you kidding me?  I haven't seen you in 20 years?  Yeah, give or take.  Yeah.  Geez.  Heard it was your birthday.  I thought I'd call up and say happy birthday.  Because I remember the story you were telling about Andre the Giant reminded me of, see, 
[01:13:30]  because I'm not 7'4", but I still weigh about 500 pounds.  Every time I'd walk into the room in the morning to relieve Opie, he'd go into orbit around me, you know?  Are you really that big a dude?  Oh, I am one big, big, big, big SOB.  Yes, sir.  Bear Man, it's Jim.  Do you remember Spuds Buckley?  Oh, absolutely.  It worked for the time.  Tell him, Bear Man.  Come on.  Oh, my gosh.  It was wonderful. 
[01:14:00]  And Spuds was a hero in that town.  Spuds never had to buy a drink.  It was great stuff.  Now they'd just be thrown on him when he walked in.  No, I remember working with Opie.  He was on overnight, and then I'd do the morning show.  And when I'd come in, we'd usually, because he was the kind of guy, Opie is just fearless.  Right.  And, I mean, here he is working at this radio station for, like, no money whatsoever.  And all he would do is sit there all night and write.  Right.  He would write things.  He'd write bits.  And he approached it like he was in school, but still getting paid for the education. 
[01:14:30]  You know, that's right.  He took his craft very seriously.  And I was really impressed with it.  I always was impressed with that.  And I was also impressed with the fact that he could play softball like nobody you ever saw  and could attract girlfriends that were just drop-freaking-dead gorgeous.  We had people show up at the company softball games just to look at his girlfriends.  I want to tell a story I've never told before.  Are we live on your show?  Yeah, sure. 
[01:15:00]  Uh-huh.  We won't curse then.  But make sure you cuss it up good.  That way I get to work for you.  Do you remember...  Wow.  Do you remember how I got you to come in early?  No.  What happened?  Do you remember me playing some...  Wow, I'm going to date myself.  Some reel-to-reel tapes?  Reel-to-reel tapes.  I don't know if we should go here.  Yeah.  Yeah, keep going.  Well, when you do overnights, you know, you got the run of the place.  Yeah.  And there may have been a young lady that came up to say hi to me. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  And something might have happened.  And something may have been recorded.  Yeah.  And something may have been played for the bear man for his enjoyment.  Yeah.  Does this ring a bell?  Yeah.  Yeah, it does.  All right.  I'm trying to keep it clean.  I, you know, I was doing my show and then, you know. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, really?  But I taped it for the bear man.  Oh, nice.  The audio?  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  That's the kind of good, solid, upstanding citizen Opie was and is to this day.  Did you know what it was when you heard it?  Or did you think it was just somebody drinking soup?  No.  No, no, no.  Well, no, no.  Because, let's face it, at the time, Opie was quite the ladies' man.  Yeah.  I'm married now, bear man.  Finally.  He wasn't shy around the chicks.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You know, yeah.  But at the time, he was looking for, you know. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, but they were all psychos, bear man.  That's the problem.  You can always find a really hot girl, but they were batch.  I didn't say it.  You know, they were crazy.  Well, they were nutty because, of course, they were awake at the same time you were.  And who the hell's awake from midnight to six is a normal person.  That's true.  No offense.  I learned a lot from you, bear man.  Oh, geez.  Well, I had heard it was your birthday, and I thought, geez, maybe I could sneak in and  wish you a happy birthday and many more.  And I understand that from time to time, you'll say some kind things about us on the radio, 
[01:17:00]  and I do appreciate that, too.  Absolutely.  He's one of the good guys in the business, this bear man.  All right.  Enough of that ass, you know what?  Kissing.  Oh, I say ass, but I leave the kissing part out.  Yeah.  Boy.  K-I blank blank I-N-G.  What an idiot.  Bear man, thank you so much.  Oh, you're welcome.  Happy birthday, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Say hi to Keith.  Okay.  All right.  Keith is right there.  Yeah.  Well, he wasn't talking, though, so.  Wow.  He's shy.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, bear man was, uh, he liked living through me back then. 
[01:17:30]  So he got some audio of you, uh, having your fucking hog licked.  Well, what the fuck, man?  You're playing music for a half hour straight.  You're bored.  By the way, there was a picture of Opie up.  And, uh, can you please put that back up?  What?  This fucking picture of you.  That's not me, though.  Oh, that's not?  No.  It looks exactly like me.  That's not you?  No.  It's like Owen Wilson.  Wait, is it me? 
[01:18:00]  Photoshop.  It might be a Photoshop, but I don't care.  It's hysterically funny.  I can't even tell if that's me.  I mean, that's not my hair.  I've never had my hair.  I've had some bad hair over the years.  If you Google image Spuds Buckley, it's like one of the first results to come out.  Oh, it's a cool thing.  It doesn't matter if it's real.  It's hysterical.  Is that, but is that me with, like, Photoshopped hair?  I can't even tell.  Yeah, I think it's definitely you.  It looks like you.  But, uh, that hair is something else.  Dude, I never had hair like that, though.  It's open. 
[01:18:30]  It's got, like, it's like bright yellow hair.  And an awful, like, teeth together, kind of half smile.  It's a fucking horrendous photo.  It's like feathered hair.  It's like a 1978...  I would almost jerk off to that hair if it was, like, on a sexy chick.  It's like Farrah Fawcett hair.  Exactly.  It really is.  That is, uh...  Feathered.  Feathered.  And your neck is really wide, too.  Yeah.  That's a horrible photo.  I think that's someone that just looks like me.  How are the teeth?  Very straight. 
[01:19:00]  The bottoms have to be crooked.  If they're not, it's not me.  I don't know.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Sam, very good.  Good job at the Vince interview.  Good job at the live read.  Good job at Steve getting Bear Man a call.  That's cool.  I haven't talked to that guy in a long fucking time.  Well, he'll come in and tell us how he did.  You know, I put a call in last week to the producer.  There's not many cool guys in this business.  He's one of them.  That Bear Man was great.  And really, really...  What?  What are you doing?  Did you just hear the noise he made? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  What noise he went?  What were you just doing, Kenny?  I didn't say a word.  I opened the door.  No, you said it.  Maybe it was the door.  We heard a noise.  He said it.  Do you guys hear him?  I probably...  It's Mars.  What?  What the hell's going on with the show?  Mars is making noises in the corner.  What noise did you make?  Mars...  What noise was that, Mars?  We're blending poor Kenneth.  I know we're just trying to get to 9 o'clock, but I think we should give him a little bit 
[01:20:00]  of an effort today.  He...  I don't know.  Why would you go...  What's wrong with you?  Because I thought Steve was coming through that door, so I started laughing in advance.  Oh.  Oh, all right.  How you laugh?  Why don't we go to break and regroup here?  Mars laughs.  The FU line is back.  Is this the first week we're playing it?  How about we call it the fuck you line now?  We can.  Yeah.  We could do that.  I like just saying FU. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know why.  What?  Yeah, I got it over here.  We'll go to the FU line.  We'll continue.  Or the fuck blank.  Yeah, because he's on regular radio.  I'm like, I don't know if, you know, he's allowed to say ass, so I'm like, ass blank.  What a dick.  Which makes it so much worse.  I know.  I'm such a dick.  Yeah, exactly.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have five new voice messages.  First voice message.  Hey, this is a big old talk to you to the bitch I used to work with a few months ago. 
[01:21:00]  So, bitch, you made my wife mizzle every single moment of the day.  Fuck you and your false teeth and your fat ass and your floppy boobs.  Next message.  Yeah, this goes out to all you assholes in the morning that have to start work as you leave the house.  Put your fucking paperwork down.  Put your makeup down.  Stop texting your friends and fucking drive. 
[01:21:30]  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Dennis from Ohio.  I want to leave a big FU to Mother Nature.  Fuck you, Mother Nature.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a FU for that bitch ass motherfucker that called up saying FU to the dude that was pissed off that couldn't get his FU on the phone.  Fuck you, you fucking fat fuck.  Next message.  This FU goes out to my ex-wife.  You think he can leave me for some other guy because he's got more money and his business works good? 
[01:22:00]  Well, hey, if I were bankrupt, do you think you can call me back and take me back and come back and call me and want to get back with me?  You've got a better chance of getting laid by little Jimmy.  Well, I think.  I think.  I think.  I thought.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:22:30]  Doing some great stuff.  Right?  Yes, I've enjoyed most of the crush. 
[01:23:00]  I'm liking the O&A sweepers.  I'm liking all the behind-the-scenes bits we're doing.  We're on our way.  After all these years, we're finally on our way.  Fucking E-Rock told me I got six more birthday calls to go through.  Well, you said you wanted a birthday special thing.  Which basically proves that these guys hate me.  I get uncomfortable with this stuff.  Most of these people don't care.  They're being forced to call the show.  I don't think they don't care.  No, they don't.  Can I say that I'm now obsessed with Bob Kelly's Twitter? 
[01:23:30]  Bob said every time we talk about it, he loses followers.  I know.  I encourage everyone to follow Bob.  Yes.  Just to look at some of the fucking horrendous things he sends out.  And the misspellings and the misquotes are absolutely worth it.  I don't understand it with him because he's on tour with Dane Cook.  He's flying around in private jets, right?  Yeah.  Playing to what?  15,000 people a night?  17,000 a night.  Yeah, huge crowds. 
[01:24:00]  And his tweets suck.  Bob is a fucking boob.  Here's one he wrote.  Hanging backstage with the boys, Showtime in Utah.  That's one sentence.  It should have been hanging backstage with the boys, semicolon, dash, period, space, capitalized, next letter.  But he wrote, hanging backstage with the boys, Showtime in Utah.  And then the next sentence is, hanging backstage with the boys, Showtime in Utah.  The same sentence twice in a row.  That's a tweet you would have done in January. 
[01:24:30]  For real.  I'm not even going for a joke.  For real.  That's how fast this Twitter thing's moving.  When everyone got Twitter, reading those little mundane things were kind of interesting, right?  But now, you've got to pump it up, or you're going to lose followers.  Now, this is a good one.  Around 3 a.m. Vegas time, Show this Friday, Saturday, Sunday at the Pearl at the Palms.  I don't know who cares.  And pretty much, if you're sending a tweet without a picture, it's almost, almost useless at this point. 
[01:25:00]  Almost.  Right?  I sometimes will, if I have a photo of something, I'll send it.  But sometimes a photo takes a couple minutes to open.  So there are times where I actually just want to read someone's tweet.  Most times, I actually don't go to the photo, because it takes, you have to have a good connection to open it.  No, I don't want, people should not stop following Bob.  Everyone should follow Robert Kelly.  He's a funny guy, but he really hasn't figured out this Twitter thing yet.  It's Robert Kelly, fans. 
[01:25:30]  Just to enjoy the misspellings.  Oh, you misspelled?  Bob, all I think about is fucking Bob Kelly's tweets.  I misspell, and then I discovered something called check spelling on my phone.  It's a wonderful thing.  Another uncomfortable call for me.  Lucky me.  Hello.  Hello.  Happy birthday to me.  Happy birthday to me.  I'm just going to say this.  I haven't been part of this show for coming up a year now, and the first thing I hear is now, all of a sudden, we've resorted down to grammar humor. 
[01:26:00]  My God, what has happened after all these years?  Well, I'm just trying to give him Bob Kelly a beating, because he's a...  Wait, you know who this is?  I have no idea who this is, but I have to defend that.  Bob Kelly...  First of all, Bob Kelly's an a-hole.  Okay, let's just establish that.  He's a fool.  Holy shit, Elo!  Oh, hi, Eric.  I didn't recognize...  Elo!  Elo!  Elo!  You can't be on the phone with us now that you're working for Oprah?  Oh, you know, I'm on vacation.  I got a little window here.  Holy shit!  Hi, Eric.  I'm happy. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, how are you guys?  What's up, Eric?  What's going on, Jimmy?  Well, I'm okay.  You're certainly missed.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, we got to talk, my friend.  How are things going at Oprah?  Hopefully terribly, and you're ready to leave.  Yeah, that's what we're hoping.  Listen, it couldn't be worse.  I'm just ready to leave any minute.  We're hoping for a complete disaster and that we get to work with you again.  Trust me.  Oh, you're too sweet.  You're too sweet.  You lost a lot of weight.  We're looking at a photo of you with the two chipmunks.  What is that? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, that was...  Yeah, the chipmunks are actually me.  The chipmunks are dressed as me in the picture.  That's me, the fat one on the left.  Is that a recent photo?  That was during the inauguration back in January.  Yeah, I'm probably down to about 160 pounds from my drinking weight of 210.  Wow, you lost fucking 50 pounds, man.  And I just started following you on Twitter only, I don't know, two weeks ago, and I read  that you might be running a marathon?  Yeah, well, I just signed up for a half marathon already, and I may do the Chicago one this year. 
[01:27:30]  We're talking to Elo, right?  Yeah, same guy.  Same guy.  Same guy that drank Super Agent Bob Eatman's entire wet bar after the Letterman taping.  What made you change there, Eric?  I don't think we ever talked about this.  You know, honestly, it was just time to...  You know, it's one of the things that just kind of got off the wagon once we had Hudson  and just started running, working out, and felt a little bit better.  You know, after you stop drinking, you give it up, you don't really miss it that much. 
[01:28:00]  You mean you get on the wagon like...  How long has it been?  Do you dabble occasionally, or are you completely off?  Yeah, no, I'm completely off.  That's great.  Wow, that's awesome.  Yeah, it is so funny, Jimmy.  I mean, you know, because you've done the program.  When you say, oh, I don't drink, people look at you like you're crazy.  I'm like, oh, he must have been arrested or have one of those deweys.  I'm like, no.  You know what I tell people?  Because sometimes people really are so weirded out when you don't drink, and they're like,  why don't you drink?  It's just sometimes easier to go, I'm allergic to it, because technically that's true, and it 
[01:28:30]  just shuts them up.  They're like, oh, that sucks, and then they never ask again.  You know what's weird with me?  My casual drinking is even way down.  Like, I used to like my wine, and now I don't even like that.  It just, I don't know what's going on.  It's called getting older.  It sucks.  You think?  You think?  Yeah, it's called getting older.  It's just an awful thing.  How's Chicago?  It's great.  I'm actually in Georgia right now.  I'm actually down in Atlanta, outside of Atlanta, hanging out down in the Warren.  But Chicago's great.  You guys are sounding great.  I was listening to the other day, I was listening to Live at the Compound Gate. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  They saw it our way for once, which is kind of nice.  They're going to allow it for now.  But you know what?  My go-to place this year for my birthday was going to be Chicago, but Elo went to Georgia on me.  Yeah.  Because I've never been to Chicago.  I almost said the Windy City.  Glad you didn't.  You'd have been doing the last hour by yourself.  That's so hack.  I know.  What's the Twitter name there, Elo?  Because a lot of the old fans want to check you out. 
[01:29:30]  It's E. Toppenberg, which is my real last name.  Good luck trying to spell it.  Yeah, exactly.  T-O-P-P-E-N-G?  E-N-B-E-R-G.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, I take a peek at Oprah every once in a while because my girl's got it on.  And that's the truth because most people go, no, I bet you watch it.  It's not a show for guys like us for the most part.  But who is that singing sensation that was just building out that tune that had everybody crying?  Oprah was crying.  Oh, it's Sharice. 
[01:30:00]  By the way, new single on iTunes, number two on iTunes.  That's Sharice.  She's from the Philippines.  She's from the Philippines.  And she, I mean, it's not my type of music.  It's kind of like a Celine Dion type of genre.  She belted out this tune.  The whole Oprah audience lost it.  Yeah.  And she cut a song by Diane Warren.  She's 14, 15 now, I think.  And she's amazing.  She's really amazing.  What have you told Oprah about Opie and Anthony? 
[01:30:30]  Well, I've heard I spent most of the time talking about little Jimmy Norton.  I'm sure my name has come up many times.  Right.  She has a book club.  I'm trying to get her warmed up a little bit.  You know, so I dropped off a copy of Happy Ending, and we'll just go from there.  How many times have you run into Oprah's office as she's trying to Google your name?  Oh, Oprah, you don't need to do that.  I've got to talk to you about something else right now.  Right.  That'd be none.  Does she know you by name?  Oh, yes.  Yes, sir.  Okay, so you actually work.  You're not just in the company. 
[01:31:00]  You actually work right with her.  He got a good gig for himself, this Elah.  Yeah.  No, no.  And by the way, everybody asks the same question.  What is she like?  And she's exactly as you would expect her to be.  I mean, she's as wonderful a person as you would assume she would be.  I've actually heard she's really nice.  People who have met her have always said that she's...  I have to sneeze.  People have always said that she...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Go, Jimmy.  Go.  Go.  Go.  People have always said that she's...  People have met her on planes and stuff have always said she's very personable, 
[01:31:30]  and, you know, she's nice to everybody.  Harry, have you had Shawn Stevenson on your show?  On Oprah's show?  If we do, I'm not familiar with it.  I don't think so.  You would know.  He's three foot tall in a wheelchair.  He's 45 pounds, and he's like a motivational...  Oh, yeah, that speaker.  Anthony Hopkins.  No, Anthony Hopkins.  Anthony Robbins.  Anthony, sorry, Robbins.  Yeah, Anthony Robbins.  What is it?  Hannibal III?  He's like a...  What do you call him?  He's a motivational speaker.  Motivational speaker.  He's like a dwarf, but he's in a wheelchair, and I forget what he has, but his bones break 
[01:32:00]  easily.  Yeah.  He has the same thing as the character in Unbreakable, as Samuel Jackson had in Unbreakable,  but he has it for real.  I'm reading his book.  He came in to promote it, and it's perfect for Oprah.  Perfect.  And he's in Chicago, by the way.  Really?  And he used to intern for Clinton.  He's got a really good story.  When he was born, this is the part of the book I'm up to.  This is a laugh riot. 
[01:32:30]  When he was born, he broke every single bone in his body.  That's how he started his life, with every bone broken in his body.  Welcome to the world.  Yeah, no kidding.  So you might want to look him up, though.  I will.  I will.  So what are you doing for the birthday tonight?  Big plans?  Party?  I think the girl's got something, because I try to get a couple things going.  She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I think she's going to try to surprise me with something.  Now, Jimmy, you're on the tour, too. 
[01:33:00]  Are you out this weekend, or are you in town?  I'm going to L.A.  I'm doing a benefit, some benefit for Tom Hanks' charity, whatever the charity is.  It's at Carolla's house, and it's with Leno and Bob Saget and Jeff Ross and Patton Oswalt and me.  That's great.  Yeah, no money.  So it's a great way to spend Memorial Day making money.  I mean, I think the next weekend, you've got a gig next weekend.  Where was that one at?  Do I have one next weekend?  He's just trying to lead you, my friend.  What is happening? 
[01:33:30]  What's wrong with you?  No, because I'm actually thinking I will be in Chicago.  What happened to the show?  I mean, I used to throw softballs at you, Jimmy, to get you plugs, and it's like you're like sleepwalking.  What is going on?  No, no, I'll tell you why.  Wait, you're going to be in Chicago?  Yeah, I don't have any gigs coming up in the next few weeks, so I didn't know which one you were.  I couldn't think of one to mention because my, I forget when I go back on the road, but I'm going to be in Vernon Hills at Zaney's.  So I'd love to see you when I'm out there.  I'll be out there for Friday and Saturday coming up either in June or July.  Maybe I fly with you, Jimmy.  You should go out there for that. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, we should do a little rendezvous.  Elo, it makes me sad to talk to you.  Yeah.  Brings back all those good memories we had building this thing together.  Oh, it was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  You're going to a lot of Cubs games?  I do.  We live five blocks from the stadium.  Jeez.  My one memory of going to a Cubs game is I was out there for a comedy festival, and they gave us free tickets to the Cubs game.  So I went because I was in Chicago, and I guess it was by the second inning. 
[01:34:30]  I had to shit so badly.  I did not think I was going to make it back to the hotel.  I just walked out in the second inning.  I stiff-legged, and I jumped in front of someone for a cab, and I made it back to the hotel.  That's my Chicago Cubs story.  Well, we can probably do one better.  At least you can come to my house, which is closer, and then go back to the game.  How about those apartments where you can just sit on the roof and watch the game from there?  Yeah, those are great.  Those seats are sometimes more expensive than they are actually getting the damn stadium.  Well, didn't they make them pay for them or something?  Like the stadium was mad that they were selling those?  They did.  They did.  Fascinating conversation. 
[01:35:00]  We're having no cares.  Yeah, but it's Elo.  Come on.  A lot of people miss you, Eric.  Well, I miss the pests, too.  I miss hearing from them.  And, you know, I just was thinking about whoever got my e-mail and all those lovely photos that they used to send me.  It just brings back all the terrific memories.  Right on.  All right.  Well, I'll definitely let you know when I'm going to be out in Chicago.  Please do.  I follow you guys on Twitter, too, so I'm part of the Twitter thing.  I stealthily follow under that name, and I enjoy Opie's morning wake-up pics. 
[01:35:30]  And where he's running, and, you know.  I'm doing, like, radio bits on my Twitter now.  That's what I do.  It's great.  It's entertaining.  All right.  Thanks, Eric.  It's entertaining.  Well, I know you guys have got some great radio ahead of you.  I'm sure.  Yeah, we'll be out of here in an hour.  July 7th.  Sounds great.  I just – I can't wait to hang up and hear Jimmy critique more semicolon talk.  I mean, that's just –  But, Eli, I understand the point you're making.  It was embarrassingly boring.  But I am smashing Bob because his Twitter, he's such a fool. 
[01:36:00]  I'm like, people just have to follow Bob because he's a funny dude.  It's not about his – he just – around 3 a.m. Vegas time, show this Friday, Saturday, Sunday at the Pearl at the Palm.  I'm like, that's the whole thing.  So what are you doing?  What are you doing, dummy?  Yeah, what are you doing, stupid, with his sexy new photo where he's pointing, kind of looking sexy?  Eric, for my birthday, I want Oprah to just give out my Twitter.  That's all.  That's all.  She was the fastest person to reach a million tweets. 
[01:36:30]  Is she in a million already?  Yeah.  She was a million, I think, in two weeks.  I understand.  Or, like, just put a graphic up that's the wrong graphic, but it's my Twitter, and go, oh, wait, that's wrong.  And then go to the real graphic.  Just a little slip-up that gets me a few followers.  Yeah, what would it take for me to get an interview on Oprah?  Oof.  That would be a tough putt.  That would be a tough putt.  Why?  She had no openings?  She's pretty booked.  She's pretty booked.  Who does she have coming up?  I don't know because we're not taping now.  The season's over.  So we're done. 
[01:37:00]  We're on hiatus until the fall.  Which is when?  So what do you do now?  Oh, we just sit around and do nothing.  We just hang out.  It's a great gig.  Is she off for the summer?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know that.  I thought these guys taped all year.  No, they got seasons.  Okay.  Yeah, she's done.  Well, you're definitely missed.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, I appreciate it, guys.  Well, I miss you guys, too.  I really do.  I really do.  And you know what?  When you come to Chicago, you better call, and we should all go to dinner.  All right. 
[01:37:30]  Thank you.  Perfectly appropriate.  But it's funny.  When he called up, he starts critiquing the semicolon talk.  I'm like, who is this dick?  That was him.  And he was right.  He's getting a little lazy, isn't he?  He didn't see that one coming?  No, he's all yammering through.  We'll do dinner.  Right.  All right.  Play around and golf, will we?  Will we?  Will that ever happen?  No.  We'll go into Chicago.  I'll text him.  He'll get back to me two days later.  I just saw this. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  Fuck you think I don't know you?  Kind of happened, actually, because he comes to New York a lot, because Oprah has offices  here, and he always goes, oh, let's do lunch, and then I don't hear from him.  By the way, I'm looking at this fucking fuel leak.  Oh, that's a great story.  The fuel leak story?  This guy, there was a United flight going to Tokyo, and that's actually his footage.  He took footage of fuel leaking out of the wing.  And he saved everybody on this plane, because they were going, where were they going? 
[01:38:30]  They were going to Tokyo.  Yeah, so they had to go over the ocean for many hours, and if they discovered this problem  over the ocean, they could have had a serious issue.  So the guy, who was he again?  He had some kind of...  I think he had some military...  Yeah, some military experience.  He's looking out the window, and he sees the fuel just flying out of the wing, and he's  trying to get their attention, and they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, but they finally  listened to him, and then the pilot walked back to the guy's seat to check it out for  himself, because the pilot was trying to figure out why he's losing fuel so fast. 
[01:39:00]  And then the guy happened to take video of the fuel flying out of the wing, and then  they said, wow, and they turned the plane around, and where did they land, San Francisco  or something?  Yeah.  But the fucking flight attendant, the flight attendant, actually, let me see, I think  I have this story here.  This is how stupid sometimes the crews in these...  I had this story, and I can't find it.  All I'm thinking of now is stupid Elo listening and critiquing the show, and I'm all nervous.  Oh, I know.  We get all the...  He was...  But you missed my little thing, though.  He comes to New York all the time, and we try to do lunch, and then I don't hear from 
[01:39:30]  him.  He goes, yeah.  He goes, yeah, when I get to New York, I'll give you a call.  We'll set it up.  And then a week goes by.  You got it?  Yep.  Right after Tokyo Bound 747 took off, this guy spotted what looked like fuel leaking from  the left wing.  You're always scared to mention it, because you don't want to look like an asshole.  I don't know why we're so scared to tell them anything, but about an hour later, once  he was certain what it was he was seeing, he alerted a flight attendant, who at first brushed 
[01:40:00]  off his concerns.  Sometimes that stupid fucking flight attendant almost got everybody on the flight killed.  Mm-hmm.  He got her attention by saying, ma'am, it's an emergency.  I told her, you need to inform the captain before we go oceanic.  He used that word.  And the captain was, like Ope said, trying to figure it out.  So he went to his seat, looked out the window, and he watched the video.  And they said, they decided to go, instead of going back, they landed in San Francisco where  United has a hub.  And their flight was delayed by six and a half hours. 
[01:40:30]  And the guy said, when we got off the airplane, everyone was thanking us, adding that he flew  to Tokyo the next day, seated in the first class section.  They're afraid of them probably round trip.  I had something like this not as serious happen on a U.S. air flight.  I forget where we were going.  But I was in the emergency row.  And I could see that there was some tape.  They used this silver tape on the wing sometimes.  And it was peeling off.  And I was uncomfortable with it.  So I got the flight attendant.  And we were delayed by like an hour because they had to go and rechange the tape on the 
[01:41:00]  wing.  And it was like someone next to me was kind of mad.  And I said, like, what would you rather fucking take off with that off the wing?  What's the matter?  I love the people that get frustrated.  It's like, all right, I get this one.  I'm okay with sitting here if you really think there might be a few screws loose.  But what type of flight attendant would blow off the concerns about fuel leaking out of  the wing?  God almighty, how stupid.  How long have you been flying?  A lot.  Exactly.  So answer your own question. 
[01:41:30]  They're good at making sure the brownies are just right.  The hell do they know?  I saved a plane load of people.  No offense to you, you know, flight attendants.  Can we take a break?  I think we should.  It's 8.15.  No, we can't because there's another birthday call to make me uncomfortable.  Oh, good.  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you.  This is the best birthday ever.  Half these people don't even want to call.  Of course, half of them, 100% of them.  Who wants to get up at 8 in the morning and give a happy birthday to another guy? 
[01:42:00]  You know what?  It was great to hear Elo's voice, though.  It was.  I love the audience.  I can't get him on the phone anymore, so it's nice that he calls in for the birthday.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were actually talking to me yet.  Are you calling in for Ope's birthday?  Yeah, well, I'm calling in for Weez so he can say happy birthday to Ope.  Oh, God.  My heart just stopped.  I'm like, did they just, like, you know, find an ex-girlfriend of mine? 
[01:42:30]  Possibly.  Really?  Did we have sex?  Maybe once or twice.  Nice.  Yeah.  Great improv.  All right.  Do you want me to tell him that you're ready for him?  Yeah, let's go.  All righty.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Why is Weez calling?  I can do this off air.  We're, we talk all the time. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, that's, can I, can we get a break?  Well, where, where's, what happened?  Oh, we just on the air.  I really, okay.  Who else is supposed to call?  Maybe we can blow off some of these.  I'm really uncomfortable.  Oh, no, it's, people want to sing happy birthday to you.  Dan, who else is calling for?  Hey.  Weezy.  God bless you, my brother.  Opie, 39 years old tomorrow.  That's right, my brother. 
[01:43:30]  39 and looking like Obi-Wan Kenobi and pulling off the great radio stunt of being on a million  stations all over the country and having a ball doing it.  What a gift.  Can't we just do this when we're not doing our radio shows?  I wish.  Yeah, I could, you could just call me at home.  Why do we have to do this in front of everyone?  Oh, somebody, I don't know, bro.  That's what I was wondering myself.  Yeah, okay.  But somebody asked.  Honestly, we just heard from Eric Logan.  I haven't talked to him in a year, so that makes for some cool radio, you know? 
[01:44:00]  But Weez, I talk to all the time, so we could just do this in the privacy of our own homes.  Bro, I agree with you 600,000%, but I was pushed.  And by the way, last year, I went to Rochester for the birthday.  And by the way, man, where are you going this weekend?  Just curious.  Well, I mean, my thing is to try to, like, you know, hit a city every year for my birthday.  I was going to go to Chicago, but Eric Logan's in Georgia.  I think the girls got something planned, but I'm not really sure.  A little sneak fun thing.  I'm thinking, hopefully, or I'm going to be really disappointed. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, because I got a spot waiting for you up here.  Yeah, I know.  I'll be up there soon.  I still got to get my tattoo.  Lily got two tattoos already.  What do you got on you, Lil?  I got a, on my cute foot, I got a star.  And on her ugly foot, she's got a nose.  And on my wrist, I got my name in Albanian on my wrist, which means freedom.  There you go.  Pretty.  Very, very good.  How about that energy this broad's hitting you with?  And Anthony, you don't really have a met him, but my producer, Anthony from Brooklyn, 
[01:45:00]  got never had a tattoo, tattoo version, virgin, and he got some Jesus action on him.  Wait, now, I hear you guys online all the time.  Anthony sounds like the type of guy that would have a lot of tattoos.  Yeah, he sounds like it, but he's basically really a pussy from Brooklyn.  No, I'm working on it.  I'm going to get another one today.  I'm going to see Gooch at a physical.  Yeah, see, you hear the voice?  That guy should have a lot of tattoos.  What are you guys talking about today?  What are we talking about today?  Well, we've had some, you know, a lady founded a car in the water, so we had to talk about that. 
[01:45:30]  And I'm staying away from the politics for the holiday.  Yeah, because when you talk the politics, you know, we had, we had Jesse in.  Oh, my God.  I love the Jesse.  See, we don't know what to think of the Jesse.  Well, how was the set?  It had to be a great set.  It was a good set.  He always, I'll tell you where he loses me.  Like, I really believe we should question the government all the time.  I wonder what Bush and the gang knew leading up to 9-11. 
[01:46:00]  But then when he starts getting into, you know, they...  Conspiracy.  Yeah, super thermite paint.  He just kind of loses you.  Now he's on to the super thermite paint theory and this and that.  We had a physicist on our show, Dr. Michio Kaku.  Wow.  I love Dr. Kaku.  And he explained the whole thing and said the buildings felt like they were supposed to fall.  Yeah, the conspiracy theorists make other liberals look even worse.  Oh, so, okay.  I like this.  So, all right.  So, you're not all in with the conspiracy thing.  No, no.  But you would believe that maybe some things, you know, might have been known? 
[01:46:30]  Well, no.  I just think things that you actually see, I think things that you can actually debate,  like the fact when conservatives always put forth Bill Clinton had Osama bin Laden in his sights,  and people always picture Bill up on a hill somewhere.  He did, though.  Let me finish, bro.  You guys shut the hook up.  He was standing there in a helicopter looking down the scope of a gun.  But then when you pull off the bait and you say,  Condoleezza Rice was handed a dossier on Osama bin Laden and didn't know what the hell was going on 
[01:47:00]  and didn't do anything, those are the kinds of things I'm talking about, bro.  Yeah, I'm still in when I hear that type of thing.  Absolutely.  That's all I'm talking about.  But, you know, but the demoing the towers, we live here, you know, that's so ridiculous.  Well, and by the way, I know you had my buddy Pete Dominick on the program.  Sorry for calling in on that one, too.  But that was a semi-request.  But, man, I love the Pete Dominick, and he knows a lot of stuff. 
[01:47:30]  I'm not kidding you.  Yeah, Jimmy and him went out pretty good that day.  It was a really good set of radio.  I just wish I had, because Pete was definitely informed.  I just wish I had been able to talk to some of the same interrogators that he was able to talk to.  You know, but I like Pete.  He's just way too liberal.  He's a psychopath.  Jim, okay, listen, Jim, I got to tell you, I was just listening to the kid's show yesterday,  and he had that interrogator on again.  I mean, he has this guy who's got a book who supposedly interrogated 1,000 al-Qaeda members, 
[01:48:00]  and this guy breaks it all down.  He was just on again yesterday.  I mean, that's something that everybody should hear.  Don't you agree?  I'd be very interested to hear.  Of course, I would put much more stock in what an interrogator says than what my opinions on it are.  I would also want to hear, though, from other guys who have actually used the technique and found it help.  I would want to hear from both sides and just kind of figure out who made more sense.  Well, that's fair, but then you've got to find out who's vibing, too.  Well, yeah, it's like you never know, because Pete got annoyed when I raised this point.  I think this guy was FBI. 
[01:48:30]  From what Pete said, Pete said the FBI yanked him back.  But as everybody knows, the FBI and CIA, they very rarely communicate properly with each other.  They love throwing each other under the bus.  So an FBI guy would probably love to just take shots at the way CIA was doing stuff when CIA is in hot water.  You know, that's the way they operate.  Well, I know the FBI is the agency that's mentioning that kindness and trust in all those methods worked a lot better, according to them.  Yeah, and the CIA is the one getting screamed out for the waterboarding. 
[01:49:00]  But I think the whole thing is crazy.  To do it to soldiers is wrong.  But to the number three guy in Al Qaeda, I think you've got to kind of take the gloves off.  Well, I mean, I can feel it.  I can feel it.  But, you know, there's just too much controversy, and this stuff is going to go on forever.  I just want to ask Jim Norton if he ever has time, if we can get him up here to the comedy club, if I know we can make him a lot of money.  I would love to.  As a matter of fact, we've talked about that recently.  The only reason I'm not doing it now is because there's something in Buffalo that I'm working on, and I want to separate them.  So I'm not doing one.  Because I can't draw in both. 
[01:49:30]  I'm not big enough to do both.  Dane can do both.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I have to split them.  I think you could do both.  No, I don't think I'd sell out in both.  With Wee's behind you, you could do both.  Yeah.  No problem.  Joe T is sitting next to me.  He can't get to the Norton.  Why?  I'm not very accessible.  I'm very easy to get to.  All he's got to do is pretend he's a chick and email me.  Hey, pretend you're a chick and send something dirty.  Joe T, who's got the big, oh, can you tell the Jerry Seinfeld story? 
[01:50:00]  Which one's that?  Who was the guy who owned the comedy club that didn't really even know who he was?  Oh, that's JJ.  JJ.  Yeah, JJ, I forget I'm on the radio here, and you might hear this.  Who cares?  Bro, listen, wait a minute.  JJ, you know, we get the comments on the radio show, so one day he told us Seinfeld was coming,  and, you know, we have him on the program.  That was a big deal, right?  Yeah.  But it turned out to be, what's his name?  Schimmel.  No, no, Steinfeld. 
[01:50:30]  He thought we were coming.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Schimmel, he told us David Chappelle was coming.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, he was a little confused with his comedian, so.  Hey, by the way, Schimmel just got in a little trouble, right?  Yeah, well, I guess they dropped the charges.  Did he beat up his wife or not?  Well, who knows in real life.  Right.  But that's one of those charges that I don't want to talk about.  Controversial.  But I was on a conservative talk show yesterday, believe it or not, and we talked about that  stuff because, man, if a woman wants to do you up one phone call and you're in trouble 
[01:51:00]  forever.  Yeah, that's the truth.  Even if you did nothing.  Yeah, that's the Anthony tells a story about his brother.  Brother Joe.  Brother Joe was having a problem with his wife at the time.  And basically, they're in the kitchen and having a little disagreement.  She picks up a frying pan.  And this is how it's been told on our show, and smashes herself in the face and then calls  the cops.  Bro, it can happen.  And man.  And brother Joe, swear, that's how it went down. 
[01:51:30]  And then he was in a world of trouble after that for a while.  Yeah, bro, it's terrible, man.  I mean, who knows the percentage, but a woman has a weapon called a telephone, and you are  screwed forever.  It's the same thing if you ever get, somebody ever calls up and mentions the word pedophilia,  you're guilty.  You are guilty.  Once someone mentions it, it's it forever.  Whether you did anything.  Nothing.  Yeah, absolutely.  One final thing, because I know you're doing your show. 
[01:52:00]  Terrell Owen.  Are you guys excited up there?  Bro, are we excited?  I am the biggest fan of every a-hole in sports.  Anybody that's known as a goofball or a dickbag, that's my man.  So I am so excited that he's coming here.  And then, you know, we're hoping to be at training camp.  Lily's already thinking she might get a date with Dio.  I don't mess with black guys.  Oh, I forgot.  That was nice.  Why doesn't she mess with black guys?  Do you add it?  She thinks it rubs off. 
[01:52:30]  Happy birthday, bro.  Let me let you go, Norton.  I hope we get you up.  I'm sorry for the call, Ope.  No, you definitely will get me up.  And it's good talking to you, man.  I'd definitely like to come up there and do a gig.  Yeah, right on.  Thanks, Wheeze.  See you guys.  Love you, man.  Love you, too.  The J.J. story that sticks out in my mind is the...  Is what?  Is what?  I want to hear it.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We got Vossipedia as we go to break here.  Opey and Anthony starring Jim Norton.  Today.  Attention, college students.

[01:54:00]  Oh, my girl's here.  Nice.  Hello.  Look how she makes me smile.  All I see is Steve's ass.  Oh, there she is.  Let's go back to the phones.  It's my almost birthday.  Hello?  Happy birthday, man.  Happy birthday, man. 
[01:54:30]  Did you get my gift?  Gift.  Oh, I recognize him.  Do you?  I do.  Wait, keep going.  Check the mail, man, because any minute now you're getting, it's on dry ice.  It's a lifetime supply of Ponderosa steaks.  Come on, baby.  Dane Cook.  What's up, man?  Happy B-Day.  What the fuck?  What's up?  Very cool.  How are you, man?  What's going on, man?  We were just talking about Robert Kelly and his awful tweets.  Are you talking about Bobby's tweets?  They're horrendous. 
[01:55:00]  I figured you'd be talking about Bobby's brand new website.  Oh, the sexy head shots?  I'm going to throw acid in his face when I see him.  We don't know what he's doing.  He's a funny guy.  And you've got to teach him how to do the Twitter thing, Dane.  Listen, I'm with him.  He's going through some kind of, like, male menopause, early midlife crisis situation.  Yeah.  You know, because he's dropping the weight.  And then he did these shots of, like, him as Frank Sinatra with hats, like hoodies and hats. 
[01:55:30]  I wish he'd do a shot of him as JFK with his fucking head blown off.  He's so, those sexy head shots, the hood, like, the kind of, like, the deep, the pensive look he has on the front page of his website with the shadow.  He's just kind of a man of intrigue and mystery, gazing.  I want to smack his face.  He's like, you know, he's like a young, old Marlon Brando. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, that's perfect.  Perfect.  I mean, we're excited for him because he's on tour with you.  It's a nice hit for him.  But what the hell, man?  I don't know.  Bobby will always have that look to me.  Like, you remember when you were a kid in school, it was a bald guy with a magnet pen, and you would just put hair around his head.  Yeah.  Whatever, magnet face.  Yeah.  That's it.  Bobby's got that thing going.  He's just.  Dude, what's the thing with the scarf? 
[01:56:30]  He's wearing, like, a, like a, like a, like a, like a Kangol hat, and his head is tilted, and he's wearing a jacket, which he thinks makes him look really sexy.  And what is he doing with the scarf?  He's, like, putting it around his head.  The scarf, and then there's the outtakes.  He's got one where he's wearing a bonnet.  These sexy bonnet shots.  He's got a couple, I think, where he's wearing, like, one of those colorful rainbow clown wigs, the red, green, and blue.  He looks like an icy. 
[01:57:00]  Who did his, who did these shots?  I think the devil himself.  Yeah, we haven't been able to talk to him about his head shots yet, but I got a couple things I want to say.  First of all, Dane, your Comedy Central special, amazing.  Oh, thanks.  Amazing.  And then I'm reading here, you're going to be the first comic to headline the Staples Center in Los Angeles.  Wow.  Yeah, May 30th, we're doing it at Staples, which is just incredible. 
[01:57:30]  I can't wait to bring the show through there.  The thing is, with this show, too, is it's like people were asking me before it started,  you know, yeah, I saw you on the tour, you know, in 07, and, you know, is it going to be most of that material?  And, you know, I'm just psyched that it's a new hour, a new hour plus.  It's pretty much kind of what you saw in the special, but then there's another, like, 20, 25 since we filmed it that I've been kicking around.  So it's cool to be out there with new, all new shit. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, you're definitely mixing it up a little bit on this tour.  It's called Isolated Incident, and it's the number one iTunes new releases, and you're number three overall behind Eminem.  Who's number one?  I think it's like Adam Lambert, Eminem, and Green Day or something, and me.  I haven't checked the list.  No, that's pretty good company when you're talking pop culture right there.  Yeah, I know.  I'm just psyched people are listening to it and laughing, man.  It's definitely a good, it's been a good week.  Now, Dane, I was spying on you and Robert Kelly last night. 
[01:58:30]  So this is very weird you're on the phone today, and I'll tell you why.  Oh, please.  No, this guy knows what's going on with this social networking thing, okay?  Now, I missed the boat with MySpace.  I missed the boat with Facebook.  I sort of missed the boat with Twitter, although I'm doing okay.  And I see you got a new one.  And I am on board early, my friend, finally.  What is this, what is it called, Zanel or something like that? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, I work with these guys, Zanel, who are, they're almost like, they're kind of in that Twitter vein where it's like, you know, instant kind of status updates.  But they were smart enough to add video and photo updates.  And so I worked with those guys on the iPhone app that people have been following me on the tour with.  Yes.  Well, yeah.  It's almost like a documentary now that we can make, you know, day to day.  You can upload, you know, any footage from the show or backstage or stuff we've done on stage that, you know, maybe people didn't see on the special. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, Zanel.com is pretty badass.  I was fooling around with it last night.  I'm not ready to go, you know, on the grid yet with it.  But I was fooling around making some, you know, quick videos with my BlackBerry.  And I'm like, holy crap, this is where this whole thing's going.  Because I make videos, but then you have to load them up to YouTube and all that.  This is, like, instant from your phone.  Yeah, everything was, you know, with the iPhone app, it's, like, everything I can do on the phone, whether it's, you know, the status update, which is fine. 
[02:00:00]  You know, even though, you know, how many, what does that even mean?  Hey, I'm eating a slice of pizza.  Yay.  You know, it's like.  See, Dane knows.  Dane, I was just saying to Jimmy, like, when we all got into Twitter, it was kind of fun to say, look at my breakfast.  But now it's already, this thing is on a rocket ship.  It's like a shooting star.  And already that type of thing is boring in that world. 
[02:00:30]  So you've got to, like, either send a pic or a video or something like that to try to keep the interest of your followers, you know?  Yeah, I mean, I'm still, my home base has still been my space.  And I do most of my work out of there.  I've had an amazing relationship with those guys.  They've always been really great to me.  And so people know where to find me first and foremost has always been through my space.  And everything else is kind of, you know, cool to play around with a little bit.  Yeah, very cool.  Well, Dane, I know you're a busy guy.  And I definitely appreciate you calling in for the birthday thing.  Hold on, Dane.  Before you go, I've got to say, how many gigs? 
[02:01:00]  Let me say, how many gigs have you done with Bobby?  Now, Dane's on an arena tour.  So you're doing, I'm going to guess, let's just round it off.  Say 17,000 seats a night, roughly?  Yeah, yeah.  How many shows have you done with Bob recently?  We've already done about 15, 16 gigs.  Let's say 15.  170, I got it already, Jimmy.  And then another...  170,000.  And then another 80, maybe 85, right?  So 250,000 people already?  250,000 people Bob performed in front of.  Now, Bob had about... 
[02:01:30]  I know where Jimmy's going with this.  Bob had, when he started his tour, he had about 5,000 Twitter followers.  Okay.  He now has...  Leave him alone.  7,850.  That's impressive.  He's picked up 2,800 people after doing 15 arenas.  I've fucking picked up more people in a week.  What is Bob doing wrong?  He's a funny dude.  And I think of those couple of thousand, it's pretty much just the same fat eight  in MySpace that just make new pages. 
[02:02:00]  But how many followers could Dane Cook have on Twitter?  For real.  What do you got?  You got like 30,000, 40,000?  You got 30, 40?  I have like 380,000 followers.  Well, you know what, dude?  I'm just the opener, dude.  Oh, fucking Bob.  I wish he was here so I could just poke his eyes out for this website.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to get people to follow him because Bob said every time we tease him, he loses like 500 followers.  I want people to follow Bob just to look at his horrendous grammar and his fucking horrible punctuation mistakes. 
[02:02:30]  Bobby's typos are so bad that you know how like most web browsers have automatic spell check update?  Yeah.  They put a little red line under.  Yeah.  Like even his browser just shuts down on him.  Like just gives a few suggestions.  I think this is what you were trying to write.  I don't know.  Man's a fool.  Yeah.  Hey, Dan, I'm glad you're doing so well with everything that happened to you in the last year or so, man.  Yeah, I appreciate that, man. 
[02:03:00]  It's definitely been a, like I said, I'm absorbing it and just enjoying it with my fans this week, and that means a lot for you to say that.  So happy birthday.  Cool.  Jimmy, good talking to you.  And is Ant there too?  No, he's homesick.  He's actually got the shits.  Yeah, he had explosive diarrhea today.  Oh, by the way, tell dumb Barry, because when Dane was in town, Barry sent me an email and goes, you know, hey, do you want to do a spot on the shows or one of the two shows?  I got it.  Like I was doing something with Voss at the New Jersey Hall of Fame. 
[02:03:30]  It was like the night of the last show is when I got the email.  So tell Barry to call me, because I don't always check my email every day.  Yeah, I'm like Barry.  Maybe give some guys a heads up before we ask them to go on in seven minutes.  Yeah, it was like Saturday afternoon.  It's like, all right, Barry, we understand I'm not blowing the doors off the comedy world, but I am booked day of.  I actually did tell him, I go, hey, listen, can you even see a few days in advance once we go back through there if Norton wants to come through?  And he's like, I'll definitely get to that, man. 
[02:04:00]  Cats is like snail mode.  So sorry I was so late, man.  No, it's fine.  It's been cool to have you on that.  I just didn't want you to think I didn't get back to you.  That was why I got the thing late.  But all right, man.  You were doing the inducting, and how did that go?  It was good.  You know, I mean, me and Voss kind of bumbled our way through it, and nobody fucking knew who we were, and it was uncomfortable.  And Buzz Aldrin blew me off for a fucking sign of my picture.  Besides that, it was great.  Who did you have to talk about?  I mean, Costello, we inducted.  Oh, that's right.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, it was great, because I heard Jerry Stiller was the one who canceled. 
[02:04:30]  So they just, they panicked, and they called Voss, and they called me, and we both said yes.  So they're like, all right, could you guys do it together?  They just kind of threw shit against the wall, and we both picked up the phone and took it.  Perfect.  Bobby showed me a picture of Voss the other day with, like, his old teeth or original teeth.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I mean, his mouth should come with a letter of apology.  He's horrendous.  Did he have the shitty, long, like, greasy, jerry-curl hair?  Whatever the photo that I saw was, I've never, and I mean this, I used to watch, like, those extreme makeover shows. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Whatever, what did he do to his mouth?  That's a little smoke and crack, you know.  He just genetically had bad teeth, and I guess he never took care of them.  Yeah, look at his old head shots.  We're looking at it now.  It's unbelievable, the space between those teeth.  Wow.  And the hair and the dumb smile and the shitty chain.  Voss was horrendous.  Voss is, but he's not, I don't really know him that well, but he's a dad now and stuff, right? 
[02:05:30]  He's a dad for the third time.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  He's got two daughters basically leaving high school.  Well, one, I think, is graduating, and then one pretty much right behind her, and then  he's got a new one that's, what was he saying?  An 18-year-old, a 17-year-old, and like, less than two years old.  Yeah, the 16 months.  No, 20 months, whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  Okay.  All right.  Well, congrats to Mr. Voss.  Yeah, good for him, right?  And, yeah.  All right, man.  Have good shows, and when Bob wakes up, just slap him right across the face. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, I'll drop my balls on his head just to get him going.  Perfect.  Please tell him that website.  We have to fucking work on that.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Dane.  Later.  Dane Cook, everyone.  I'm glad he understands how fucking Bob's head shot on that sultry look.  Dude.  All right.  Intern Matt actually handed something in today.  Hope it was a suicide note.  What are they doing? 
[02:06:30]  Now this is getting uncomfortable.  Why?  Why are they drawing the curtains now?  I'm sure it's not for anything terrible.  A dancing girl?  I honestly don't know.  I don't think so.  Are we going to have a dancing girl in here?  If we do, it'll be...  What?  What are they doing?  Jimmy, what are they doing?  I honestly have no idea.  I'm sure it's nothing.  It's probably...  They're probably bringing someone that they don't want you to see.  That's what I'm going to guess. 
[02:07:00]  They've closed the curtain and opened his eyeline.  Dan, is this cool?  Oh, Dan.  Oh, a cake.  Well, how about the happy birthday part?  Matt, you're supposed to sing.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Opie. 
[02:07:30]  Happy birthday to you.  To me.  Yay!  Are you guys being forced to do this today?  Of course we are.  Now, this is fun for us to sing happy birthday to a guy that we know.  It says...  Oh, it's cool.  It's a fudgy-wudgy bar cake.  Yeah.  Mars, did your wife make that?  Yes.  Cool.  Wow, really?  It looks like a giant fudgy-wudgy bar.  Wait, I got to get that on Twitter, man.  Those cakes, your wife makes excellent-looking cakes.  That's pretty amazing. 
[02:08:00]  It tastes like shoe leather.  It doesn't matter what it tastes like.  It just looks good.  I'm going to have a piece.  Oh, that's cool.  All right, we're going to take a break and cut up this cake and then wrap up the show next.  I normally wouldn't, but it's a special occasion.  Wait, but first, Thousand Ways to Woo Your Lover, featuring Andrew Dice Clay Silverstein.  Intern Matt wrote this?  Yeah, guys, I did.  Matt, what the fuck?  They're saying it's good, too.  Thanks.  Well, I just blew it.  Tried to make the best of an interesting situation. 
[02:08:30]  I'm bombing, so I'm going to shut the fuck up.  I'm going to have to go walk.  Why?  That was great.  No, no.  No, continue.  Early radio.  I've never done before.  Yeah, continue.  All right, let's play this for everybody, and we're going to wrap up next.  We're going to start the weekend early today.  Jimmy's got to go to L.A.  Ant's not here.

Banana Juice LTD.  Saving relationships since 1978.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Without Anthony today, he had explosive diarrhea. 
[02:10:00]  He wasn't even missed.  He actually did the first hour with us.  Yes, he did.  An Opie I trust in Denver writes,  I spent my last birthday alone with a broken collarbone.  You get to talk to Dane fucking Cook.  Stop bitching, ass.  No, I just get uncomfortable.  I'm very appreciative of what everyone did for my birthday.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't really like this type of attention.  It's weird.  But I like it.  Like, I want it to happen, but then I don't want it to happen. 
[02:10:30]  If that makes sense.  Right, Jimmy?  Yes.  Hey, the cake is amazing that Mars' wife made.  No.  It's a fudgy-wudgy bar cake.  Actually, Iraq got a real good picture of it.  Could you send it to me so I could Twitter that shit?  Opie Radio on Twitter.  That's what you could do for my birthday.  Follow me, I guess.  Yeah, what are you doing for Opie's birthday, Iraq?  He took you out of obscurity.  Yeah, what are you doing for me?  And ruined this show with you.  I got Bear Man on the phone.  Yeah, that was pretty impressive.  I haven't talked to him in a few years.  Yeah, but I made the Bear Man connection when I was doing a phoner. 
[02:11:00]  Did you like the Bear Man interview?  Even the part where I had to talk about that?  Yeah.  You want to come on the radio?  Horrified?  Do you want Eric?  Huh?  Do you want Eric to sing happy birthday to you?  Yeah, maybe Eric can take off his shirt and sing happy birthday in his underpants.  I think that's a great idea.  I think in nothing but his underpants, he should sing happy birthday to you.  Oh, that's a good idea.  The girls agree.  Everyone agrees.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Iraq should stand in his underpants and socks and sing happy birthday.  Don't talk.  You don't like talking.  Shh.  She almost talked on the radio.  That's crazy.  Mayor.  Yeah.  This is my friend, Mayor.  And she is completely insane.  I'm not completely insane.  And I suggest that everyone follows her on Twitter because her tweets are ridiculously crazy. 
[02:12:00]  I'm semi-hilarious.  No, you're crazy.  And really boring.  No, you tweet some good stuff and people should follow you.  Do you follow her on Twitter?  Jimmy doesn't follow me.  He doesn't even know who I am.  That's Mayor.  Oh, hi, Mayor.  Hi.  Did we meet?  That's my...  We met.  We met you New Year's Eve or whatever it was.  We met New Year's Eve and we met, yeah, the wedding.  Okay.  Yeah.  She's, you know...  The only thing you've ever said to me is, I watched you talk to yourself the entire time 
[02:12:30]  you were walking down the aisle.  And I was like, that's so embarrassing.  Oh, yeah.  I think you are.  I was like, why was I talking to myself?  And you're like, yeah, you were talking to yourself.  She was the maid of honor.  I don't remember what...  That's a big shindig.  What were you saying?  I was saying, step, step, step.  Cool.  Helps.  It was really genius.  Why?  You were just nervous about doing it wrong?  Yeah.  I was worried about stepping.  Stop and then wonder why you're not moving?  Well, I didn't even know I was talking.  You were the one who was like, this is what you were saying, too. 
[02:13:00]  And I was like...  Oh, did I tell you what you were saying?  Yeah.  I don't even remember.  I just say so many things.  Wow.  You want to tell Jimmy the advice he gave you last night?  I'm good at giving advice to Mayor.  Cool.  Hopefully the advice was sleep with Jim Norton.  Ooh.  No, that wasn't the advice.  I don't remember what you told me last night.  Well, you're kind of like a boy, right?  Yeah.  And I said you had the big boobies going for you.  Oh, so it's okay if I'm a little bit fatter. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's okay if you're a little fatter?  I thought that's what we talked about.  Because I was like, I'm not as skinny.  And you're like, it's okay if you're a little fatter, because your boobs are bigger.  And you're not fat for Eerie.  Exactly.  Which you got going for you, too.  Exactly.  See?  So you got a lot of good things going for you.  I got a lot going for me.  But you said that one.  Can I ask Mars why he's cutting 65 pieces of cake?  There's fucking nine people in the entire complex.  There's no one here today.  What are you doing, Mars?  You're just excited. 
[02:14:00]  You just want to cut cake all day long.  Mary, you want people to follow you on Twitter?  Yeah.  Well, before we give out your Twitter address, though, you got to kind of give us something.  Give you something?  What can we get from your Twitter?  Well, um...  Give it to Danny.  Write it down for Danny so we can go through your Twitter and decide if it's worth mentioning  to about a million people right now.  Okay.  Because you'll get tens of followers after this plug.  I'd like to have tens.  Tens. 
[02:14:30]  Tens more.  Tens more.  That's an E.  By the way, Travis from Kansas City writes, she sounds completely insane.  I would like to marry her.  I'm looking for a husband, so...  She just...  This girl will just take off and just start driving around America.  I can't stress how insane this girl is.  And that's why we keep her around.  What do you do for work, Mary?  I'm currently unemployed.  I just dropped out of school, so things are going really well for me. 
[02:15:00]  She decided after, you know, almost four years of college, she should just drop out.  Oh, it's been five and a half.  Five and a half.  Which is just brilliant.  What do you want to do?  Well, I'd like to marry someone and have babies and have a swimming pool.  I don't really need a house.  Preferably maybe at least a trailer.  Just a pool for them to wander into when you're busy?  Yeah, I'm going to, you know...  Have the babies in the pool, swim in the pool, sleep in the pool. 
[02:15:30]  You have nice feet.  You think?  Yeah.  My toe is, like, bigger than most males' toes that I've seen.  She has pretty nice toes.  My big toe is humongous.  It must be a good toe because Jimmy's not into feet.  Really?  I didn't see the big toe, though.  I mean, he doesn't have the big foot fetters.  She just knows that you have nice feet.  She could stop a car in the Flintstones.  Exactly.  But her feet are nice.  The big toe is huge.  It's embarrassing.  My thumbs are the same way.  It's gross.  It's your thumbs.  That's fine.  The only problem with potential suitors out there, Mare does like to pick her nose. 
[02:16:00]  I do.  Do you really?  Um, yeah.  Mare, is it like a nervous habit going to your face?  Yeah.  Me and, yeah.  Well, me and, uh...  I don't pick my nose as much.  Have you noticed, Jimmy?  Yes.  I'm doing better.  I now blow my nose.  Look, I got tissues and everything, which is so weird for me.  Tissues?  Who needs a tissue when you got a long fingernail?  I blew my nose in your shower a lot this morning, so I didn't tell.  I didn't tell anybody. 
[02:16:30]  Wonderful.  Is it just hanging on the wall?  It's like just...  No, it's sitting in the drain.  All right.  Why do you pick your nose?  Do you have bad sinuses?  Um, I've got pretty bad allergies.  What do you load you to?  Dust, dogs, cats.  Really exciting stuff.  Don't you take allergy medication?  I get three shots a week.  Um, I take pills and nasal spray.  Okay, you're hooked on nasal spray.  Right now, I have Afrin wearing off.  Oh, no, I don't take Afrin.  I occasionally, like, I couldn't sleep last night.  Really?  Because I'll take Cialis once in a while. 
[02:17:00]  Mm-hmm.  Just to really punish my girlfriend.  Is it fucking me isn't punishment enough?  Get out of here, yo.  Are you a fan of the Cialis, Mare?  Um, I like the commercials.  Why?  Because they're stupid.  Oh, okay.  Dogshit sniffer.  Follow her Twitter.  I want to follow her home.  Did you find any good tweets by Mare, Dan?  Dan, it's going to be really up to Danny.  Honestly, is there any weird ones worth reading?  Oh, no.  I haven't really seen anything so crazy yet. 
[02:17:30]  Some of them are kind of boring, like, when I talk about clothes or something, but...  Well, because you're in the fashion business, right?  Yeah.  Right.  Business.  And why do you wander around America?  Like, all of a sudden, my girl will get, like, a phone call from you, and you're in some weird state just wandering around.  Um, well, I just, I really just prefer the white trash, you know?  It's just way more interesting than being in New York or a big city.  I like the middle of nowhere.  Are you a nice girl, Mare? 
[02:18:00]  I'm super nice.  No, I don't mean that.  I mean, um, are you a Philly girl, right?  Uh, yeah, I love that.  I have very bad luck with Philly girls.  Really?  Yeah, they're hot, but none of them ever sleep with me.  Well, she's not from Philly.  She's not from Philly originally, though, so...  Where are you from Berkeley?  Uh, Erie, Pennsylvania.  I was hoping for Boston.  You liked Boston.  I used to take out my dick and walk down the street in Boston and meet someone.  But in Philly, nothing.  Really?  No.  Hmm.  No, I'm a big flop in Philly with the girls.  I don't, I don't know why.  Why do you think that's...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hmm. 
[02:18:30]  So you're single?  I'm, well, you know, I have a rotating cast of, uh, boyfriends, but, uh, I guess technically  I'm single.  Are you dirty?  Um.  Is Mare dirty?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  I'm not dirty.  No.  A little bit?  No.  You pervy?  I mean, I only shower, like, once every three days.  I don't mind that, actually.  If we have good chemistry, I don't mind a little fucking armpit smell.  You want to smell her armpits to see if there would be chemistry?  Oh, I didn't shave them.  No, not if they're hairy. 
[02:19:00]  Huh?  No.  You could just smell them.  All right, I'll smell them.  It's only been two days.  I mean, we're not, you know, I don't have a fetish for it.  It's a chemistry thing.  If the chemistry is good, that can be sexy.  Let's see if there would be chemistry with the smelling of, uh, Mare's armpits.  All right.  Come on, Mare.  Do you want to come here?  Mare?  It's the birthday show.  You got to do this for us.  Whoop.  Are you mortified?  Um, semi, because my...  Semi.  All right.  She's wearing deodorant, so it's hard to tell.  She smells very clean.  She smells good.  You want to smell her ass crack, then?  No. 
[02:19:30]  You don't...  Oh, now you draw the line.  I mean, as long as I don't have to pull my pants down, it's whatever.  Yeah, that's fair.  She probably dropped a deuce.  That's why she shouldn't do it.  Can you drop a deuce before you came over?  No, I haven't in a few days.  I've been taking diet pills.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm serious about this weight loss thing.  That's why you're eating cake.  She's eating red velvet cake.  If you can see my face, it's confused.  Yeah, I guess that would probably be a bad...  Yeah.  Odd question.  Are you into spanking at all? 
[02:20:00]  Um...  I'm not opposed to it.  Okay.  Are you into spanking at all?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like it.  Good.  All right.  All right.  No, I'm just...  You should end the show now.  It's 9-10.  Oh, really?  All right.  Yay.  So I guess...  See, we don't give out your Twitter.  You didn't make it good enough.  Oh, seriously?  Yeah, you got to give us something.  Yeah.  You will get...  Some followers.  You'll probably get 30 or 40 people easy. 
[02:20:30]  Well, Opie...  She's very sexy.  Opie already follows me, so...  I do.  Um...  I've never called you that before.  And you're my best buddy.  We are best buddies.  We're best buddies.  Don't call him Opie.  What do you call him?  I call him Greg.  Why?  Because that's his name.  Greg is creepy.  Yeah, I never really liked the Greg thing.  No.  I'm in a quandary.  I don't like either name.  I might go with a third name.  Sweetie.  How about that?  How about just Sweetie?  Sweetie.  Ew. 
[02:21:00]  Why?  Fuck.  Good.  All right.  Mare, you didn't do anything.  Mare's nervous.  I wouldn't want me to do.  I, like, can't...  I used to go on the radio.  Uh...  Flash.  Oh, okay.  I'll flash.  Because anyone can see that.  I don't know which...  Well, Jimmy could see it.  If you flash, I guess that's good enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy's standing up, even.  Yes, I am.  No.  I'm just gonna...  I'm gonna finish eating my cake and then take my diet pills.  Do you have a...  Do you have on song underpants? 
[02:21:30]  I have on extremely adorable underpants, actually.  What kind?  They're like little white cotton ones with ruffles.  Well, it's gonna be a ruffle?  On the side.  Not the...  Yeah, if they're adorable, you gotta show them off a little bit.  Yeah, because you're wearing them, obviously.  That kind of makes sense, actually.  No.  Can I see the side?  Well, without pulling your pants down, just lift it off that side?  I've got on, um...  She has, like, little sexy pants.  Ooh.  Those are hot.  Yeah, they're really cute.  Is this the kind of craziness we could expect by following her on Twitter?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, this is so crazy.  Danny's right.  This is... 
[02:22:00]  This really is...  Look, I'm trying, but, you know, what are you gonna do?  The fucking door...  The doors have come off the hinges here.  I'm sorry.  Whoa!  Oh!  It's early.  I usually don't get up before noon.  Those little sexy skin pants are really turning me on, to be very honest.  She's wearing skin-tight little jean pants that look like they'd be really nice to spank.  Let me play this before we leave.  All right.  Goodbye, guys.  He considers it a mistake by the university, but adds, he is not condemning the university  or the president.  Ad-lib to John.  You know what?  I'm reading everything on a prompter. 
[02:22:30]  It's all good.  Ad-lib to John.  It's all good.  At this point of the weekend, I'm...  You know what I mean?  I was waiting on the story to come up.  An amazing story about some women in Kuwait, but we'll try to bring it to you tonight at 11 o'clock.  That's all right.  What did I miss?  He said he read the words ad-lib.  Yeah, he read the, like, parentheses transition.  Oh, oh.  It's supposed to be, like, it said on the screen ad-lib to whatever the co-host was, and he  actually read ad-lib to...  Oh, okay.  Usually when we have the anchors messing up, it's, you know, it's a curse or something, so...  We should give out her Twitter, and this way we'll force her to make interesting tweets 
[02:23:00]  because she'll know that everybody is watching now.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Idea.  What is it?  Idea, mare.  Yeah.  Is this it?  Um, flamenkers?  Yeah, it's flamenkers.  It's F-L-A-M-E-N-K-E-R-S.  See, even her Twitter name is nuts.  What does that mean?  F-L-A-M-E-N-K-E-R-S.  Flamenkers.  What is that?  Um, it's what me and my sister call flamingos.  Super exciting!  Why do you call them flamenkers?  Um, because, uh, flamingos, uh, it's hard to spell, um, so I just came up with a different 
[02:23:30]  word for it.  Are you waking up now?  Uh, yeah, that would be my alarm.  That was your alarm?  Sorry.  All right, well, things have gotten a little out of hand here.  Yeah, this is getting crazy, you know.  Super crazy.  I'm gonna get out of here before we get fired.  We're handing out pieces of cake, and she's babbling about diet pills and cake.  Yeah, should be the top of her ruffles.  And the lack of, uh, showering and duty-making.  Oh, my God.  I got flash better when my grandmother had a heart attack and fell in the kitchen linoleum. 
[02:24:00]  How about you eat a booger for Jimmy?  That's fair.  I don't eat them.  I like to, uh, save them on my knees.  Um, it's actually where I prefer to stick them, but when I have pants on, I stick them,  like, on my cheek, maybe.  What?  Yeah, I'm telling you.  Do you like to put boogers on your cheeks?  I have not done a good job showing everyone how to mess.  Wait, you rub boogers on your own face?  Well, I'll just, like, save them.  You got one?  I just save them.  You got one?  I don't think so.  Get in there. 
[02:24:30]  She just put her finger in her nose.  Come on.  Come on.  Give it a shot.  We checked on the way here, and we both had nothing.  So, all right.  She's picking her nose.  Now, let's say there was a booger on your finger.  Now, what would you do?  I would, well.  Kenny's freaking out.  I guess my first initial, Kenny, I know.  She just ran out of her wrist.  I usually, this would be my initial reaction right here.  Why do you put boogers on yourself?  Do you want to save them, or do you want to be, like, were you, like, fumbled with when  you were young?  So you want to be, like, like, you'd do some weird, like, a weird, oh, okay. 
[02:25:00]  That could have been a weird anti-social thing.  So no one would be, people would be attracted to her.  No, but you should, I'll, like, once I'm done, then I'll roll them all up, and then.  And then, like, flick them?  Yeah.  Go with the flick?  Oh, isn't that awesome?  It's horrendous.  We found Kenny's kryptonite, by the way.  He cannot handle it.  He's completely red-faced.  Kenny, what's wrong with the booger thing?  You know, I've seen and done a lot of things in my life, but that's, like, the worst thing  I've ever heard. 
[02:25:30]  Really?  Why?  Well, she used to be a hot chick.  I'm so depressed, because I thought, like, you were my backup, and now.  You're not.  Now you're, I'm just, no.  And I heard Iraq used to follow you, and now he doesn't.  Yeah, he stopped following me, because he said my tweets were making him nervous, because  I was saying too much weird stuff, and he was scared for me.  But now he's going to follow me again.  Iraq is trying to be sensitive.  Yeah, I know, exactly.  He is really sensitive.  Oh, is Iraq doing the birthday thing in his underwear? 
[02:26:00]  Of course he is.  Oh, he is?  That's how we're going to end today?  All right, because I'll, can we get that fucking fat-titted zilch in here so we can get out  of here?  He said he was very, he said he wouldn't do it in his panties, but I don't know.  I think he'd get him.  Mayor, a lot of people want to take you to Olive Garden.  I love Olive Garden.  That's right.  Well, so you could pick a big crouton.  Did that nose thing bother you, Jimmy?  How could it not?  I want to spank her and fucking be dirty with her. 
[02:26:30]  It's like my grandmother would say, when you get to the bridge wave, remember she can't  be picking my nose?  My grandmother would say that.  People are trying to figure out who you are online.  All right, I'm going to go.  Brunette is the answer.  Bye, guys.  I'm going to go.  You're going to miss E-Rock in his underpants.  He's not coming in.  He's fucking around.  I got to do, I have something notarized for him.  Is E-Rock coming in in his underpants to sing happy birthday or what?  I don't know.  Is E-Rock coming at all?  If he has any respect for Opie in the show. 
[02:27:00]  Happy birthday.  Where are you going, Jimmy?  I got to go.  Are you seriously leaving?  Yes, because I have a flight to catch.  I have to catch a plane and I have to have something notarized that's important.  See, no one really gives a shit about me.  I do.  E-Rock is fucking letting me down.  You know that.  I can't believe this.  I thought E-Rock was doing this.  This is shameful.  Yep.  Danny says it's going down.  The big ending to the birthday show.  Where is this fucking...  Well, I just got an instant message from Steve that says, 
[02:27:30]  Eric said go fuck yourself.  Oh, my God.  What is that about?  Sam.  On your birthday, he said that?  Danny, what's that about?  Did I just get a go fuck yourself?  Eric said, fuck him and his stupid birthday.  I'm not doing it.  He said that about Opie?  What?  That's what Eric Nagel said.  Eric the Sex Bagel Nagel said that.  What a Sex Bagel asshole.  That is wrong.  Well, Mary, you got to do it in your brown panties.  I don't think that's going to happen today.  Oh, sorry.  I'm getting dirty luck.  Eric said, I don't care if you fire me.  I'm not doing it. 
[02:28:00]  Eric said that.  Why?  You know what he's trying to say?  He thinks Opie doesn't have the power to fire him.  Or the balls.  That's exactly what he's doing.  What?  Steve, is he doing it?  I don't know.  I haven't been listening.  I don't know.  He's still screaming, fuck him.  Oh, my God.  Why is he mad at me?  Because he doesn't want to be humiliated.  He's an asshole.  Why?  Does he fucking get something that comes in the morning?  He's such an asshole.  He hands it to work.  Mayor, would you do something for me for my birthday?  What would you do? 
[02:28:30]  How about what?  I could give you some cake.  You could wipe a booger on my arm.  I could do that.  I don't really have any.  It'll make us best buddies for real.  You want one of mine?  Bye, guys.  I can feel like it's coming out of my throat.  I'm out.  Jimmy, come on.  I'm going to be late.  I can't.  Wipe a boogie on my arm.  That'll be good as Eric in his underpants.  All right.  Jimmy, you've got to at least see this.  Can I spank you?  Can I spank you?  I can't believe what failure your E-Rock is.  Jimmy, you want?  Can Jimmy spank you?  She's a very spankable hiney, I'm sure.  Mayor, can Jimmy spank you? 
[02:29:00]  You know she has a nice spankable hiney.  It's my front photo.  Ew, she's picking her nose.  It's so fucking gross.  I'm trying to go along.  I've got a pretty character, man.  I'm trying to go with this, but it's horrendous.  It's kind of not.  All right.  Just wipe it on my arm.  I'll make a birthday cake picture.  She's wiping her booger on my arm.  Exactly.  Forearm. 
[02:29:30]  Where is it?  Lick it.  Come on, birthday.  Lick it.  Why would you listen to me?  All I said was, come on, birthday.  What happened?  I'm a best buddy, see?  Now we're best buddies.  Look how excited she gets.  She's jumping up and down and stuff.  Last chance, E-Rock.  Is this going down?  No.  He's adamant that he's not doing this.  He says, I don't give a fuck about his birthday. 
[02:30:00]  Can we at least talk to him about it?  Jimmy, are you?  We just called him and he hung up on us.  And I have to have something notarized.  And I'm worried about leaving the city today because it's the holiday, the big getaway,  as we say.  The big, big, long weekend.  The big, long weekend.  And I got to go out to California because flights were hard to get.  Do you like the mayor?  I'm going to leave, too.  Yeah, she's a great spankable rump, but she's just a fucking weirdo.  Are you depressed now?  Huh?  Are you depressed?  Oh, no, no.  Mayor hates herself.  I don't know why a mayor hates herself.  Why do you hate yourself, mayor? 
[02:30:30]  She's eating.  She's taking diet pills.  She picks her nose.  Mayor is filled with self-hatred.  Why are you filled with self-hatred?  She's like a...  Yes, sir.  She's got that artsy mind.  She's, you know...  Are you an artist?  I guess.  Cool.  Well, we know what she uses instead of paint.  Yeah, that's how she's going to try to make it in the art world.  Can I have to leave now?  Yeah, you can leave.  The cake was a real hit, by the way.  It was.  Thank you to Mars' wife, right?  Yes, thank you.  Okay.  Thanks to the staff for getting people to call. 
[02:31:00]  Very cool.  It was awkward because that's just how I am, but in the end, I really appreciated that.  Sam?  The Vince McMahon interview was for your birthday.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  Thanks for the Vince McMahon.  Now what?  Is it necessary to suck up even more?  I'm just saying it was.  No, it wasn't.  That was for you.  No.  No.  I don't like this stuff.  What?  She likes...  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  We're going to leave, I guess.  Oh, are we setting up the Rich Voss thing?  What?  The Rich Voss giving out his password.  It was the bit of the week.  We figured it's worth a replay today.  Yeah, it'll be after break.  After break.  Maybe I'll be here.  Maybe I won't.  Oh, my goodness.  How many people do the show with?  Radio tease.  Danny and me will do the show.  Hells yeah.  What do you want to do?  Daniel getting buck naked right now.  Do the go-home show?  Huh?  Daniel getting naked.  Hell yeah. 
[02:32:00]  See, but that's easy.  I want E-Rod because, you know, it'd be very awkward.  Yeah, just the visual of him standing in his underpants with his jeans around his stupid  ankles saying happy birthday was really starting to make me laugh the story.  With his socks pulled up.  Yeah, and the fact that he's not going to do this is now crushing my day.  Me too.  And more importantly, Opie's day.  Actually, yeah, it's Opie's day.  Let's not forget this.  Hey, Mare, you're up to 300 followers.  Is that good?  What were you up to before the appearance? 
[02:32:30]  All right, she's coming back.  She's...  Previous to that?  Yeah, previous to the picking of the nose.  I had 107 and like half of them were spam.  So...  What do you mean half were spam?  Like fake people that make up names.  Oh, really?  And, yeah, have like dating websites and stuff.  Oh.  So it was like 107, but now it's a...  300.  How exciting.  See?  Just because you picked your nose.  Um, I wish I could get more for just picking my nose.  If you could belch your fart, it'll put you right over the top. 
[02:33:00]  Can you queef?  No!  I don't ever do that.  Do you have a fart in you?  I've...  Uh...  No.  She thought about it, though.  Was she a trooper or what?  Last night, definitely.  Really?  Yeah.  You didn't fart in my guest room, did you?  Um, not in the guest room, but living room.  What did you do in that...  Leather chair.  What did you do in that room last night?  Anything bad that I have to deal with?  I know you blew boogers all over the shower.  I wouldn't worry...  Yeah, I was going to say, nothing... 
[02:33:30]  I wouldn't worry about the bed or the room, just the bathroom.  What else is in the bathroom?  Um, just, like, stuff that...  Do you have, like, a guest computer that she might have used?  Because there's probably all sorts of boogies in the room.  And watch out for the guest computer.  What else is in the bathroom?  I just, like, uh, womenly stuff.  Is it...  You're going...  Yeah.  Are you serious? 
[02:34:00]  Just don't worry about it.  At least I didn't have, uh...  Do you do anything with that part of your body?  What?  Well, you know, we're talking fluids today.  Do you, like, fool around with...  Do you make tea?  I don't really think that...  I don't know if even I can talk about that in public.  It's...  I don't know if I've ever really discussed this with anyone.  Oh, you do?  You do stuff?  I don't do stuff, but...  What do you do?  I'm very...  There's a story there.  No, it's just, like, I'm very examining of all of my bodily fluids, and, uh, it's really 
[02:34:30]  disgusting.  Do you hold a mirror under yourself what you're making?  I just really want to know, like, what's going on with me.  Make sure I'm not sick or something.  So, wait, you...  Taste?  Oh, no.  Oh, God, no!  I didn't know!  Well, that's why you better explain.  So you have...  Oh, jeez, that's...  Yeah, no.  So you have your period in my freaking toilet bowl, and then what do you do?  Then what do you do?  You examine it?  I don't examine it.  Do you check for clocks?  It doesn't...  I don't know. 
[02:35:00]  Do you poke at it and make sure it's not moving?  It's good to check the consistency to make sure there's nothing else going on, but not  with your mouth.  Yes, it's like a...  Do you poke at it with your finger?  I never did two days ago.  What?  What?  What?  Oh, yeah, it was just two days ago!  Just two days ago!  Dan, now, do you believe me?  This girl...  We're getting there now.  We're getting there.  This girl's worth following on Twitter?  Getting there. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, but she's got a tweet about using her cycle as dip.  I don't...  I don't...  What do you do?  You poke at it with your finger?  I just...  I don't know.  It's like I just thought that there was my...  I don't know if I can really talk about this.  I don't know.  Well, it's out there now.  What do you think?  Sam.  It's just us?  Don't be a bad influence on me.  It's all good.  He's like, no, you really can.  You just go like this?  You'd poke at it?  Yeah, just like that.  We were in the T-1000 was going to rise back and kill you. 
[02:36:00]  I don't know what that means.  It's a Terminator joke.  Oh, I see.  That's why.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Thank you, Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Did you say something mean?  Ope, your guest toilet is filled to the brim with clots and snot.  Call a plumber.  Oh, someone's got a brand new nickname.  Clots and snot.  Clots and snot.  Clots and snot.  Clots and snot in the morning.  Pew, pew, pew.  I don't know if that's something I want to be known for. 
[02:36:30]  What?  The poking at your own byproduct.  Do you think anybody's going to reply on her Twitter with the words clots and snot?  I don't think so.  Well, she could just block people.  I guess I'm just going to have to get a new Twitter now.  Whoops.  It's okay.  It's okay.  You like being on Twitter, though.  I can tell.  I love Twitter.  This broad is a weirdo.  No, she's not real.  She's like...  I'm really normal.  It's just like I don't mind sharing every detail of what goes on. 
[02:37:00]  And in my body and stuff.  So, I'm really normal and nice and sweet and fun and...  And would love to do radio someday.  I would love to.  Well, what else can you talk about besides snot and clots, though?  I mean...  That's what you've got to worry about.  I could be a good entertainment reporter.  Talk about what's going on.  I mean, I couldn't talk about politics or anything like that.  I got this new bit I was thinking of doing.  It's called Backstage with O&A.  It's taken.  What?  We already have a host for Backstage with O&A. 
[02:37:30]  Somebody who hosts and writes and reports.  It's all done.  It's all taken care of.  No, I'm trying to replace the girl voice in that with another voice.  There is no girl voice in it.  What?  There's no girl voice in it.  What?  Right now, as it stands, there is no girl voice in Backstage with O&A.  I'm positive.  I'm going to make Mare do it.  Why?  It's mine.  I think we've got to pump it up a little bit.  Sam, you don't want to work with me?  Isn't it by primetime Samantha Roberts?  No, it's not Samantha.  It's Samuel.  Thank you very much.  That's what Sam is short for.  Samuel.  Samantha?  You're now Samuel? 
[02:38:00]  You're now Samuel?  What do you think Sam is short for?  Sam.  Sam short for him.  Or Samar.  Samar.  People want to know if they can see all the whites of your eyes, which is a sign of craziness.  Oh, it's close.  Oh, yeah.  It's close.  I don't know.  It's almost low tide in those eyes.  Oh, that's nice.  What happened?  Someone named Schnitt said,  Schnitt, yeah, he's a regular.  Enjoying your appearance on the show.  Enjoy your shoe shopping.  Thank you.  See, it all ties together.  My feet, the shoe shopping, my Twitter, Jimmy, spanking. 
[02:38:30]  Jimmy couldn't deal with you.  He left.  I know.  Why did he do?  He was just like, I'm just going to leave now.  He goes, look, dude, I got to be out of there by 10 and look what time it is.  It's like 915, isn't it?  You turned him.  Oh, that was when my alarm went off.  All right.  Sorry about that.  That's all right.  Anything else you want to share?  No.  I'm done.  The cake was really good.  It was good, right?  Very delicious.  How were the cupcakes last night?  I didn't actually eat any.  I just looked at them. 
[02:39:00]  Diet pills?  Sniffed them, poked them.  Like the clots.  Like the clots.  Exactly.  The snots and clots and bobo show coming soon to 202.  197 on Sirius.  Sam, you could do that one with me.  But you're moving soon, so, you know.  Well, I can, I mean, I'm flexible.  I'm moving back in with my parents, and I'm not really tied down to anything.  So, just let me know.  Really?  Yeah.  Where's going to be your next trip? 
[02:39:30]  I'm planning, well, I'm thinking about going down to the, driving down to the Grand Canyon.  There's a trailer park I want to go stay at with my friend Tara.  So.  Grand Canyon rules.  Yeah.  We're going to.  Go to the bottom.  You can stay at the bottom.  You can stay at the bottom?  Yeah, but you got to, like, you got to, like, get that in advance.  Oh.  Way in advance.  Like, year in advance?  I don't know.  Or, like, two months in advance?  A few months, definitely.  Yeah.  But you hike down on the bottom, then you stay down there for the night. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, I have to hike.  Yeah, why not?  Oh.  Or you could jump on one of those donkeys.  You could do it that way.  Well, we.  Mules, whatever the hell they're called.  Oh, Tara's a donkey whisperer, so that's perfect.  What?  What do you mean?  Well, we went to the mountains in Low Gap, North Carolina a few weeks ago, and there was  a donkey, and she was talking to it, and she was like, donkey, roll over again.  So it rolled over.  Wow, so she could jerk it off?  Into the dirt.  And then she was like, I'm like the donkey whisperer. 
[02:40:30]  I was like, you are, like, a fucking retard.  So, yeah.  What did she get from the donkey?  What was the donkey saying by rolling over?  Well, she, oh.  I guess that's the whole point.  I'm not sure what.  I don't think it was.  It was just expressing its love for dirt.  That was a good one.  Cut 50.  What?  On that replay machine.  Cut 50?  Mm-hmm.  Yay. 
[02:41:00]  Yay.  That was embarrassing.  Okay.  People want, can I take a picture of your feet?  They want a picture of your feet.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, they're really gross.  John, what's up?  Hey, get a picture of this maniac's feet and put them on your Twitter so we can all get  a look at the giant toe.  Oh, you need the picture of the giant toe?  That's fair enough.  Yeah, you know, we want to see, you know.  It really is freakishly large.  All right, hold on, man.  Let me try to do that.  Hold on.  We're just kind of screwing off. 
[02:41:30]  I hope you guys aren't hoping for great radio right now because we're not going to give  that to you.  All right.  I feel bad.  It's all my fault.  No, it's all right.  What are we doing?  All right, get in the light.  Dan, talk or something.  So you're listening to The Dan Show.  Oh, my God.  Welcome to Dan and Sam.  They're huge, aren't they?  That's what you said.  People are asking for it.  Yeah, well, it's been a long time coming, Sam, and I'm very glad that I now have the opportunity  to host a show with you.  I want to kiss more guys.  Oh, well, that's interesting, Sam. 
[02:42:00]  I mean, I don't know if I'm going to join you in that activity, but I want to kiss more  guys.  No, I'm not about that, really.  But you can do whatever you like.  I want to kiss more guys.  Go for it, bro.  I mean, it's all you.  I'm a part of this show.  I want to be live.  I want to kiss more guys.  Well, then do it, dude.  Stop talking and kiss me already.  I want to kiss more guys.  Well, then let's go.  The foot fetish picture.  Less fucking money talks and bullshit walks, Sammy.  Get over here and put your tongue in my mouth.  Dude, night.  It's your neck, bro.  Her feet look too veiny.  Oh, she's got Paris Hilton feet? 
[02:42:30]  Oh.  All right, move your feet together.  Now, her feet are nice, but that one toe is just as big as, like, three of her other  toes.  I know.  Who knows how to take a foot fetish picture?  I do.  That was really quick, dude.  There wasn't even any hesitation there.  All right, Dan, just explain what's going on.  All right, well, for some reason, this has now become a two-person shoot.  All right, get your foot up.  And we now need two people to take a picture of a foot.  Classy, like that. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, dude.  Now she's got her foot up on, like, a glass coffee table.  Can we take calls?  Hold on.  Call up if you know what would make a good foot fetish pic.  Sit down in his chair.  I noticed that foot fetish guys, they like toes, and they like the foreground should  be the foot and toes.  And then, like, in the background, it's her.  So she could almost...  Yeah, so Sam's got it going on.  She's in the chair.  But, Sam, if you're going to take that picture, you've got to have her feet up.  The shoes have to come off.  Shoes got to come off.  But she likes her shoes. 
[02:43:30]  And then what you've got to do is...  No, man, keep one shoe on, because some people like having the shoe in the picture.  Now, Sammy, when you're taking the photo...  Someone with a foot fetish, give me a call.  How do we do this?  I got this.  You've got to make sure that the foot is very large in the foreground, and she is way in  the background, so you can still see her face.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, and spread the toes out, too.  Please do not get...  Sam, do they smell bad?  No, use my fucking camera.  I see what you're doing, motherfucker. 
[02:44:00]  Tell me.  We're all, like, way up on the Twittering thing.  Sam, does she have smelly feet?  I'll tell you this.  Don't get my face.  Okay.  My mom.  Sam!  Foot fetish photo is...  No, you're not doing it right, Sam.  I so am.  Dude, you're not doing it right.  Sam.  That's not right.  It's not...  She has to have her foot, like, up, almost, like, in your face, in a way.  Yeah, I don't like the angle on this at all.  This is going to be great. 
[02:44:30]  You've got to trust me.  No, I don't like this at all.  And, Sam, could you talk with your man voice if you're taking the foot fetish picture, please?  This is my voice.  Oh, my God.  No one knows how to take the good foot fetish picture.  Dude, I'm telling you, man.  Have her toe posing in an intern's asshole.  Let me Google image you some foot fetish.  Actually, people are noticing that you do know what you're talking about, Danny.  I don't have a foot fetish, but I've seen the pictures before.  See, kind of, like, sort of like this, but not so much. 
[02:45:00]  All right, hold on.  Let me...  I'm going back in.  Come on.  Let's get this done already.  Huh?  It would look so much better if you had your shirt off.  Wait, oh.  Hi.  Don't we go from above?  Well, you could do that.  That sounds like a good idea, an aerial shot.  You've got to get this...  See, now it wants to do, like, the top of the foot.  No?  Well, how do you do it?  That's not it.  I'm telling you, man.  You've got to think about what position...  I'm going to start with taking a picture of just her giant toe. 
[02:45:30]  You've got to think...  I like that.  What position would you be in if you were about to suck toes?  Ew.  You really thought this one out, Sam.  I think we've found something with Sam.  I think he really does, like, feet.  All right, hold on.  How do you know so much?  I know a lot about everything.  Sometimes I pretend to be an expert.  Yeah, but, like, you had an answer just like that.  Yeah, well.  You thought about it.  I know things.  You want to see a girl's foot right before you suck it.  I want to kiss more guys.  Well, you could kiss more guys, too. 
[02:46:00]  It's out of context.  I mean, that's fine.  I'm getting so many nice comments.  What are some of them?  Yeah, what are some of the comments on your Twitter, Mayor?  Oh.  And by the way, no one's helping me out with this fucking foot thing.  And should we have E-Rock suck on her toes?  Definitely.  Oh, no.  He got in trouble last time, didn't he?  Oh, no.  I like, I have respectful for the boys and their ladies on the show.  Yeah, I understand.  Puddle of AIDS said, you like tequila, boogers, and the Aquabats? 
[02:46:30]  You're perfect.  Very nice.  Kurt Love said, I've never seen you, but the way you say thank you has made me fall in  love with you.  We can get married if you want.  Let's see.  Both feet together, knees slightly bent, is what they're saying.  Needs to be done.  Oh.  Together, slightly bent.  And then someone else saying, you need to put one of your feet in the crotch of a guy. 
[02:47:00]  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  What?  Did he leave?  I don't know.  E-Rock?  Oh, yeah.  Read more of your comments.  Oh, more comments?  Mm-hmm.  I clicked off.  My phone's a little slow.  Can I take my foot fetish picture the way I feel it should be done?  Yes.  You don't know what you're doing.  I do, I think.  Can you?  All right.  Get back in the chair.  Back in the chair.  Get back in the chair.  Dan knows this stuff. 
[02:47:30]  Now, put your feet up on this glass table.  On the same stage.  Put the glass table.  You got to move it just so the rug is completely black under the glass table, because that was  one of the things I was having a problem with.  No, it'll be the angle that I'm going to work this on.  It's going to be fine.  But now, you've got to prop your foot up so that the bottom of your foot is facing me.  You know what I'm saying?  Like this foot.  Yeah, like that.  Right.  Now, take the other one.  Take your other foot with the shoe and kind of go over like this and try to put it flat.  Yeah, actually, you know what? 
[02:48:00]  That's fine.  And then what you've got to do is you've got to get the angle.  Are my feet dirty?  Well, you have like a birthmark or something.  I do.  That's kind of freaky.  It looks like you stepped in chocolate or something.  Chocolate or something.  There's some picture taking.  Wait, she doesn't want her face in it, though.  Oh, okay.  I've got Sam's face in it.  Okay, wait, wait.  All right.  I'll reshoot.  Turn the TVs off.  We're taking foot pictures here on the show.  Danny and Opie down.  This is probably the creepiest thing I've ever done.  It's probably the creepiest thing I've ever done. 
[02:48:30]  I want one of these, too.  Everybody wants their own mere foot picture to take home.  I'm not behind Danny.  Now, you're going to tell me that that's not...  Look at this.  Look at what I got for you.  Yeah, I like it.  Dude.  Put that on your Twitter.  What's your Twitter?  My Twitter is twitter.com slash bigduties.  All right, I'm next.  Sam, you want one of these?  Definitely.  All right, hold on.  All right, cover your face.  All right.  Mars, get out of my fucking foot fetish picture.  Oh, look at what?  Mars! 
[02:49:00]  Stop.  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  In front of my face is Sam.  Why did my foot fetish picture get really white?  Mine's going to be the best.  Oh, because those BlackBerry flashes are something else, man.  All right, hold on.  I've got to turn off my flash.  Are people still listening to this?  No.  I love doing radio where there's no pressure.  There's another surprise birthday call if you want to go to that.  No, tell them to go fuck themselves. 
[02:49:30]  All right, here we go.  You heard.  All right.  Mayor, this is going to work, finally.  All right, one, two, three.  See, I do the three.  How we do?  How we do?  I'm probably not as good as yours, Sam.  Mine's going to be the best.  I'll send you mine.  You want mine?  I'll send it to you.  No, I'll send mine.  I'll fuck it.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  Tee hee.  All right, what do I label this, Dan?  Mayor's sexy feet.  How do you spell mayor?  Mayor? 
[02:50:00]  Where do I put your Twitter name?  That shit is so tight.  Yeah, Sam got it.  Sam knows what I'm talking about.  How do you spell your Twitter name again?  Flamankers.  F-L-A-M-E-N-K-E-R-S.  F-L-A-M-E-N-K-E-R-S?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Sam's got a good one, too.  I told you I'd do it.  At Flamankers.  Wait.  Mayor's.  What am I trying to say?  How would you spell my name? 
[02:50:30]  M-A-R-E-S?  No, no, no.  What am I trying to say?  Mayor's what?  Foot fetish picture?  Yeah.  Foot.  Oh, that is just disgusting.  F-L-A-M-E-R-E-S-E.  Disgusting.  That's so embarrassing.  This is so embarrassing.  And her lovely feet I'll just do.  I don't know.  I'm really excited.  I got an at reply from my friend, Trucker Brent.
