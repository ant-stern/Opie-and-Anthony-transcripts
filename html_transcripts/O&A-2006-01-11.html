<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recounting of the hosts' and several unnamed companions' (including Jimmy) night out in Georgetown.  This included a lavish Italian dinner, a purported encounter with the German Chancellor, and an extensive shopping spree at Lush, resulting in significant spending on bath products, particularly by Jimmy.  The conversation then took a sharp turn to a discussion of a police report filed by a runaway bride detailing a fabricated abduction and sexual encounter involving a Hispanic man and a white woman.  The hosts and callers dissected the report's lurid details and speculated on the bride's motivations.  This segment concluded with comedic audio clips from the "Diary of an Unborn Fetus" series, specifically one focusing on a child whose father was an alcoholic, detailing escalating abuse culminating in a violent incident.


The show continued with a darkly comedic, rambling story about a family dealing with a father's alcoholism and abuse, ultimately resulting in the death of his son. The narrative was presented in an exaggerated style, incorporating religious themes and the child's acceptance of his death.  This transitioned into a discussion of Michael Bloomberg's Spanish-language mayoral campaign ads, prompting a replay of their “Bill’s Dead” prank call, followed by its Spanish-language version.  Further segments included anecdotes about using a police scanner to eavesdrop on a neighbor, leading to an unexpected sexual encounter for the neighbor;  a discussion of a friend’s party boat offering "alternative lifestyle" cruises, including a Gay Pride Weekend cruise; and a studio visit by Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine.  Richard Cheese performed a song about sex, and the in-studio segment included a discussion about his new album, his rivalry with Paul Anka, and the band’s experiences.  The hosts peppered the entire broadcast with sexually explicit and offensive jokes and comments.


A significant portion of the show focused on Richard Cheese's intense frustration with Paul Anka, whose new CD significantly outsold Cheese's (8,000 vs. 1,000).  Cheese used profanity repeatedly to express his anger, fueled by Anka seemingly covering songs Cheese intended for his next album. The discussion delved into the tumultuous history of Cheese's band, detailing multiple keyboard player departures – one for a gig with Hilary Duff’s band, another due to alleged inappropriate behavior in a Vegas hotel room.  The hosts played a song, "Shit Dick," from Panzerfaust Records, a defunct white supremacist record label,  and read its lyrics aloud, which featured many homosexual celebrities.  Audio clips of Paul Anka yelling at his band were played, highlighting Anka's temper.  The hosts speculated on Anka's success, partially attributing it to his "asshole" persona.  A caller, Jeremy from Jersey, requested "Shit Dick." The hosts also discussed their negative experiences with record labels, including underpayment and contract disputes, specifically recounting Cheese’s frustrating experience with Oleo Records. The humorous situation of RichardCheese.com being owned by someone else and DickCheese.com's association with a porn site was also discussed. The segment ended with additional songs by Slipknot and a rambling appearance by wrestler Aaron Sheik.


The show then featured Stephen Lynch as a guest.  The broadcast began with Opie and Anthony's banter, including self-congratulatory remarks and a discussion about Roman Treco damaging radio equipment.  They also discussed a grandma giving sexually explicit advice on television. Lynch performed several songs, including a new, radio-exclusive song about a Nazi girlfriend and another about Satan, both containing offensive language. They discussed the songs' reception at colleges. The majority of the remaining broadcast focused on Jim Norton's recent appearance on the Jay Leno Show.  Audio and video clips were played, showcasing Norton's stand-up routine, including jokes about massage parlors, prostitutes, and interactions with celebrities like Ozzy Osbourne and Tiger Woods.  The hosts speculated on Norton's future, predicting his departure from the show and discussing the need to replace him with Rich Voss, who was present in the studio.  A caller expressed displeasure with the constant praise of Voss.  The discussion also included Hillary Duff's appearance on the show with Norton. The hosts and Norton exchanged offensive names, expressing both excitement and cynicism towards Norton's success.  The broadcast concluded with continued discussion of Norton's career prospects and loyalty to the show.  Sea Bass was also mentioned as being present at some point during the broadcast.

[00:04:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you very much.  All right.  All right.  I'm sure it's not going to help whatsoever.  Yeah, we went shopping in Georgetown and we discovered a shop called Lush.  Here's Opie and Anthony.  Here's Opie and Anthony.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Oh, who took their shoes off.  There's a bunch of things I want to get to.  There's a bunch of things I want to get to.  There's a bunch of things I want to get to right off the bat.  There's a bunch of things I want to get to right off the bat.  I was trying to remember.  You were saying something about that thing and...  Well, our little evenings last night. 
[00:05:30]  Well, I guess we could start with that.  Sure.  You guys went out.  Well, we went to Georgetown and we ate at a fine Italian restaurant.  It did.  We knew it was going to be a good restaurant because right at the front door is a picture  of Bill Clinton and Hillary.  Oh, really?  That's where they went for Valentine's Day.  Both of them?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were...  Like there's any romance in that marriage that they need to go out for Valentine's Day.  I guess it's his favorite restaurant here in Washington, D.C. in the Georgetown area. 
[00:06:00]  A fine Italian joint.  We had a really good meal.  Yeah.  We're hanging out and all of a sudden the Chancellor of Germany walks in and the whole place stands  up and applauds.  Really?  That was a little weird.  Yeah, except for us.  We had no idea who he was.  He looked like the fat guy from Lethal Up in Two.  The South African guy.  Right.  Yeah.  That's exactly what he looked like.  Really?  We're just assuming he was the Chancellor of Germany because our waiter was telling us that  there's a special VIP area where...  Because we asked, you know... 
[00:06:30]  So why did you pick the Chancellor of Germany for him to be?  The waiter said that the Chancellor of Germany is here tonight.  Yeah, they said that he's here tonight.  Yeah.  But maybe he was already here and this was another guy going to this VIP area.  Because we asked, we're like, where does Bill go when he comes to this restaurant?  Because he can't just sit out there with everybody.  Wow.  All the schmucks like us.  So there's like this back room right next to the kitchen that they go into I guess.  Ah.  Yeah, so we're sitting there and also this big, just enormous...  He looked like a raging alcoholic to be honest with you. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  He looks like he's been to a few Oktoberfests in his day.  All the Europeans are anyway.  And then his like security looked like we could have taken him.  He's a little weird guy with pistol balls in his right...  Really?  Yeah, and we were studying his bulge trying to figure out what kind of weapon he had.  And he gave us the up and down like, don't even, don't even think about it.  I talked to the chancellor, I said hello and he went, Kaffa lover.  I pardon you.  There's a ring around the restaurant. 
[00:07:30]  So we had dinner and then it was Lindsay and I, it was Jimmy, it was Derek, it was Martini Steve, and we all started shopping.  Shopping.  Shopping.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shopping.  Now, what could you shop for?  Well, Georgetown's awesome.  It's, it's a lot of fun.  There's a, you know, there's a martini bars, there's nice restaurants.  Ooh, martini bars.  There's a, there's great shopping, there's Abercrombie and Fitch and The Gap and, I mean, you name it, they have it there. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, whatever you want, man.  Nice shirts and clothes and soap and shoes, like whatever you want to buy, there's plenty out there.  Yeah, why don't you back up?  There's no Rodeo Drive.  Exactly.  And you missed the key word there.  Yeah.  I know.  He's trying to get, he's trying to get past this.  Soap.  Soap.  I like soap.  What's the name of the store we went into?  I don't know.  Lush.  Lush.  What?  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop it. 
[00:08:30]  How, you even, how would you even go into a store named Lush?  We're walking by the store and the loveliest scent hit me.  I was hit by a lovely scent.  Oh.  Jimmy loves to shop.  He loves stuff like Pottery Barn and Bed Bath and Beyond.  He likes these like, eh, like kind of girly stores.  Yeah.  They have a word for guys like that.  Package.  There he is.  His whole, his whole demeanor changes though. 
[00:09:00]  We're walking by this store called Lush.  Did he go, ooh.  That would have been more masculine.  It really would have been.  And all of a sudden he, I don't know, he, I guess you, you smelled the, the fragrances  coming from the store.  It was an ensemble of fragrances.  Ah.  Because we're on the sidewalk, the doors are open and all of a sudden Jimmy goes, ooh,  or whatever.  And, and he just runs into the store.  A cornucopia of scents.  So, so we walk into Lush and Jimmy is just beyond excited. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  He wants to know about all the soap.  Ah.  The place has got these handmade soaps.  Okay.  And it's, it's, it's like, they look like just chunks of like clay, but they're, they're  just, they're.  You know what it is?  It's like cheese blocks.  Exactly what they look like.  Cheese blocks.  Like big cheese block looking things of soap.  Yeah.  And then you smell one and then you go, oh, I like that.  And then they.  Each one tickling the olfactory.  And they cut off a piece of the, uh, the soap for you. 
[00:10:00]  They cut it off and wrap it up all night.  Oh, look, he's got his soap.  What, this is a, this here is called Bohemian soap, specially crafted with luscious lemons  to get you squeaky clean.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, martini steam.  It works great for getting male jizz out of your ass crack.  It would, it would've been more masculine to wash my face with a cock.  Oh.  So, uh, you know, there's a lot of people.  We're all hanging out. 
[00:10:30]  Here comes martini steam with his bag.  He's got his lunch bag.  Oh, you bunch of fruits.  You bunch of fruits.  I'm not gay, but I like to be lemony fresh.  Oh.  I didn't get the lemon one.  I got the.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't know.  What, what is it?  Is it?  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There's martini steam has walked in with his bag from lush.  Oh, they still smell.  So, so Jimmy's running around this joint thing is the coolest thing he's ever seen.  They have stuff like bath bombs. 
[00:11:00]  Bath bombs.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  It's like the size of a softball.  And I guess you drop it in your bath water.  It's like an Alka-Seltzer tablet.  Oh, and you get a little bubbling action there.  Wow.  Lavender.  All the scents you'd want for bath bombs.  Of course.  Then they have like face soaps with actual seaweed in them.  Really?  And they have soap for every type of skin problem that you might have.  Oh yeah.  Dry skin or oily.  So Jimmy, there's mostly women in this place. 
[00:11:30]  Of course there are.  Working there and shopping there.  And Jimmy just kind of takes over the whole joint.  He's got two or three people working for him.  You're asking questions.  All sorts of questions.  Asking your soap questions.  What's good for this?  What's good for your pores?  Yeah, because I want to get a facial.  A facial.  I've never gotten one.  You've got a facial, all right.  No, not that kind of facial.  Not the fun kind.  Hey, Bobby Bigrigger is very confused on the phones.  He says he likes urine and soap.  Both very, in a weird way, cleansing. 
[00:12:00]  There you go.  If you want to tease my tinkle enjoyment, that cleanses things, I think.  Uh-huh.  So he's running around all excited.  And we're all just kind of standing around, taking a slight interest, Anthony.  Like, oh, that's a little interesting.  Oh yeah, whatever, you know.  Next thing you know, we're all shopping.  You're all sucked into this whole thing.  He sucked us all in.  Picking up, this one is very good.  This is my favorite.  It's the Demon in the Dark soap.  It's called Demon in the Dark.  Of course it is. 
[00:12:30]  It has a lovely, like, mint flavor scent.  And it says, peel the wax, lather, and wait for your dark side to appear.  Oh.  Ooh, saucy.  This really is the type of soap you should be using on yourself as you open your robe,  while you stand there in the doorway, thanking your friends for visiting again.  They have gentle on your sarcoma.  Wow.  Yeah, they have soap that looks like brownies and all sorts of crap, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  It was quite amazing.  And this bastard sucked us all in.  It's a great place, though.  You can't not buy soap when you're there.  You have to.  They're all different shapes and sizes.  Anthony, ready?  Jimmy, how much did you spend on your soap yesterday?  A few dollars, I think.  How much?  A few bucks.  This bar was $11 for this bar.  $11 for that.  Well, yeah, this is sandstone soap.  Follow the Brazilians and keep your body smooth with sand soap.  Yours only cost $11?  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  What kind of a hunk did you get?  I got this for $16.  I didn't even realize.  That is a $16 bar of soap.  They weigh it.  They weigh it.  Is that what they do?  Of course.  You're going to be shitting me.  They're paying for it.  You'll lather with it.  Oh, you got the same one, Steve.  Yeah, yeah.  I sensed you.  I was told not to get the sandstone soap.  By who?  It's exfoliating, I bet.  Well, that's what...  I was looking for one of those soaps for my face, and like, you don't want the sandstone.  It'll just rip you apart.  That's for like your feet, Anthony.  You know how it gets all calloused in the middle of summer? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  What's that?  It's got that rough skin and it's all peely.  Oh.  So you use that on the bottom of your feet.  Rockstar soap, is that what that's for?  For your feet?  No, this is...  The sandstone soap.  The sandstone's for your feet.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Don't use that on your face.  I'm going to.  No, they say not to use that on your face.  Maybe gently, but slow circular motions with just your fingertips.  Dude, it's actual sand.  Fruit.  It's actual sand.  Dude, look at this dispenser.  It has a helmet on it and you squeeze the bottom two things. 
[00:14:30]  But it says, aim for back.  But Jimmy's the worst.  He's the worst.  Because he sucks everybody in.  Yeah.  And then next thing you know, everyone's pulling out their credit cards, walking out of the  store with their little Lush bag.  Lush bag.  You can't help it.  It was just fun stuff.  And then we're walking around Georgetown trying to look cool and you can't look cool  with a Lush bag.  No, you can't.  Is that the receipt, Jimmy?  Yeah.  How much total?  Actually, it's not the whole receipt actually.  It's something else.  What was the total that you spent on soap last night? 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  Wait.  No.  The bottom number, Jim.  No, but there's a bunch of numbers.  I spent, it's more than that.  Oh boy.  I know about how much he spent.  Oh boy.  Not that much.  Less than $40.  No.  No, you couldn't, you couldn't have gotten out of there for less than $40.  I got a few of these.  I got a few of these.  This cold face was $12.46 for this little bar.  What does that do?  Black soap for clear skin with charcoal, licorice, and soothing oils.  I got one of those too, Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  Of course you did.  I got one of those and then I got some body wash, some shower gel, a lemon-lime mixture  and some kind of mint mixture.  These are just good.  You're just standing there with like a bar of quarry soap, just washing your...  It has a heavy weight to them, man.  Yeah.  What's wrong with, I don't know, ivory?  Nothing.  A bar of ivory in your shower and...  Steve, what other soaps did you buy?  Soap, Bob?  I got...  Ivory is good for common people and those little people that like that, that's fine, 
[00:16:00]  but again, I'm a fancy person.  Soap diva.  This is what happens when you hit the road though.  You get bored and you start doing things.  You would never do at home.  Shopping for soap.  Soap.  I would never go shopping for soap in New York City.  No.  Steve, what do you got there?  I have a piece of the sandstone that Jimmy got and then I got rockstar soap, which is...  It's not as overwhelming.  The one thing you realize is when you walk into these places, the smells are so overpowering  you get pulled in different directions and you don't really know which one. 
[00:16:30]  Good point, Steve.  And you just...  I went for the least offending one of the group.  Yeah.  This smells like candy or gum or some of the...  It does.  Rockstar.  That's all you got, Steve?  Well, yeah.  But these two pieces of soap cost 24 bucks.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a lot.  It must have been late.  I guess the cock store was closed.  Oh, yeah.  I figured you'd just...  I don't know what time that closes, but...  I know I spent about $60 in there. 
[00:17:00]  $60 on soap.  On soap.  On soap.  Wowee.  It's not just soap.  It's not.  It's a fun showering and bathing experience.  I should have bought a bathing...  Ball bomb.  Bathing bomb.  Bath bomb.  Bath bomb.  Yeah.  Are you going to...  Are you going to, like, maybe display these in a basket in your new bathroom?  No, no, they don't.  They look like you said, like a cheese, but it's like big hunks of, like, cheese.  So, no, I'll just use them.  You could just use them.  You could kill somebody with this soap.  Yeah, they seem very... 
[00:17:30]  It's very heavy.  It's very brick-like.  Yeah, very chalky-looking softball-type things.  And what do you say?  Give me two pounds of that and...  No, they're in, like...  Imagine, like, a fruit basket, like, arrangement, but it was...  Good analogy.  Yeah, I can imagine that.  Like a fruit stand, but instead of fruits, there's soaps.  Just imagine a basket filled with a drug cocktail.  How awful is this, Anthony?  Oh, it's horrid.  Yeah, but he sucked us all in, because at first we're just standing around like, 
[00:18:00]  oh, God, how long is he going to be in there?  And we're actually out on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  Kind of checking out the sights and stuff, and slowly but shortly, we all started walking  in.  We all started walking in and purchasing your soaps.  You can't help it.  It's phenomenal.  The bath balls were great.  I'm moving into this place next week, and my tub is really deep.  I should have got a bath ball so I could have taken a nice lavender bath.  Lavender bubbly bath.  But I didn't.  No, you should have.  What else did you buy, Jimmy?  That was it?  That was just...  I think most of the soaps is all I got.  And they gave me a couple of samples, like, you know, little creams and such. 
[00:18:30]  Weren't you going to buy the face soap cream crap that has the seaweed?  The actual seaweed?  Yeah, I actually got talked out of that, because it smelled bad.  Really?  Yeah, it had, like, actual seaweed in it.  Seaweed would probably smell bad.  Yeah, I decided not to get that.  I traded it for some sandstone.  It's called Lady's Snatch.  Let's go to Sea Bass.  Sea Bass!  How you doing, fellas?  Hey.  Hi, Sea Bass.  I want to know if the Lush bag has a picture of two fellas lathering each other up on it.  Lathering each other up. 
[00:19:00]  You're not dying, Sonny.  You're soaping everyone around you.  Let's say hi to Rob.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Just want to know why Steve didn't get the flaming soap.  Is there flaming soap?  I didn't see any.  If there was, I missed it.  That would have been a coup.  Steve bought soap.  It smells like an olive.  Let's go to Tim in Jersey.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, bu-bu-bu-boys.  Good morning.  Hey, Sugar.  Hi. 
[00:19:30]  Hi, mister.  Hey, Jimmy.  Did you ask the girls when they were helping you around if they had any soaps that were designed  to help remove the scent of logs from the chest?  No, sir.  I kind of kept that under my hat.  I just asked.  I kind of hinted around.  Look, I have a son and his diapers are always full.  Is this good?  Let's see what's...  Can I, can I soap up your ass?  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep...  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  Let's go to Rhode Island, and say hi to Jeff.  Jeff, what's up?  By the way, don't you love in message boards, whenever they write something I want to suck 
[00:20:00]  your seat  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  You're...  Yeah, smart.  Hey, come on, fellas.  How you doing?  Ah, I get it.  Hey, I got a question for Jimmy and Steve.  Do you guys have to say camo when you lather up with the Brazilian soap?  Camo.  It's made for washing your belly, and you rub and go, camo, camo, camo, wash-o.  Camo.  Camo.  Why is it only Jimmy and Steve? 
[00:20:30]  I hope he bought $60.  She certainly did.  Because it's the Brazilian soap.  Oh, because I went with the shower gel.  I guess that was the expensive.  I don't know.  Shower gel?  Yeah.  What else did you get?  It was a lemon-lime shower gel.  Ooh.  Some kind of mint shower gel.  Minty fresh.  And that black soap.  Oh, that's the coal stuff.  The face.  Coal.  Yeah, it's your coal soap for exfoliation.  Did they come out singing Mammy? 
[00:21:00]  Black coal soap for your face?  Yeah, and then they had, like, soap, shampoo.  What the hell was that about?  Oh, these were actually lovely.  I was going to buy one.  Lovely.  Lovely.  Our show should never be using the word lovely.  Lovely.  Yeah, these things were cool, man.  These soaps fucking reminded me of tits, you know?  Yeah, that's it.  Big soap tits.  I wanted to buy these ones, but I didn't, they were shampooed.  They looked like those little round, like, again, like smaller cheese things, but these 
[00:21:30]  were whole circles.  Uh-huh.  Like, picture a donut.  A whole, you know, solid donut.  Right.  And they smelled great, but they were shampooed.  And I guess you would just rub them into your hair.  Rub it into your hair like a...  Yeah, like a little hair bar.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That is lovely.  Yeah, it is.  Nice shampooing experience, but I don't really need that, so I didn't buy it.  And we all walked out with our lush bags.  We sure did.  A bunch of men just walking, smelling good.  With your lush bags.  Yeah.  Thumbs up to other people.  Did you shop anywhere else, or that was your only shopping experience? 
[00:22:00]  I ran into Pottery Barn quickly.  I wanted to get a...  Dude, I wanted to...  I'm sorry.  I wanted to use some of my new soap last night, but they don't sell soap dishes in this place  that you can travel with, so I am not going to use...  Oh, jeez.  A traveling soap dish.  Well, you know, like the one that you take your block of soap in.  There's no way to wash, and then put your wet soap back in your bag.  It's going to get stuff all over.  So you would want a little case, perhaps like Howard Hughes used in the Aviator?  I almost got that last night, but I didn't, by the way.  He opens it up every time he goes into the bathroom, Howard Hughes would open up this 
[00:22:30]  little silver case and pull his soap out, and just wash until his hands bled.  Would he really?  Yeah.  Pop it back in, and hold his breath when people with polio passed by him so he wouldn't breathe  in the air that they were giving off.  Are we talking about Howard Hughes or me?  Yeah, or you, Anthony.  Yeah, a little crazy like that.  Howard Hughes would close that thing up and put it back in the glove compartment of his Escalade.  Exactly.  You can't be too careful.  And I don't think you can wash your hands to the point of making them bleed, by the way. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I think you can.  How?  You just wash them and wash them, and all the oils wash away, they crack.  Yeah?  Yeah, I've heard of that.  You've heard of that, Anthony?  I've heard of that.  All right, let's go to Don.  I never saw it.  Look, my hands are very smooth.  Let's go to Don and get out of here.  You've got money all your life.  You've got city hands, Mr. Hooper.  Tie me a sheep shank.  Get the lush soap.  Going to need a bigger soap bag.  Let's drink to your sandstone. 
[00:23:30]  So, I need a soap dish once.  Swallowed it whole.  Eyes rolled back white.  Bubble coming out of his mouth.  I'll never go into the lush again.  Hey, let's go to Don in Connecticut.  Hey, Don.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  This is horrible.  You know, you guys are, Anthony, you've got to fill up the pillowcase and just beat these  guys with it.  With the soap.  There you go. 
[00:24:00]  Ow!  Ow!  It's just funny how it goes down, though, because it always starts with Jim and you're  Oh, that smells good.  Remember, Fat Boy, it's just a beautiful...  I was trying to say beautiful and odoriferous in the same sentence.  That's a tough one to pull off.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  Ow!  Ow!  That's lovely!  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, God.  Beaten with the soap as it walks up into your nose.  Hmm. 
[00:24:30]  That's the problem with going on the road, though.  You find these little things to occupy your time and entertain yourself, I guess.  Yeah.  Because every city has the same stores.  The Gap and, you know, Abercrombie and Itch and...  Baggy stores.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  Then you see an unusual store like this and you have to take a peek because you're kind  of bored out there and next thing you know, you're spending a lot of money.  I don't even think I'll use the stuff I bought.  Someone is asking if you took a sliver off the big block named Shit Dick. 
[00:25:00]  Dude, I remember one time I was in Baltimore and I was doing the Baltimore Improv and I  actually went shopping one day in Baltimore and I was bored.  I went to Evita because the hotel had Evita in it and I had never smelled that kind of stuff.  Oh, Evita.  Yeah.  And what do they sell?  Oh, the same type of lovely, you know, like little shampoos and like little things for  your hands.  Lotions.  I spent almost $200 in Evita.  Oh, my goodness.  And it sat in a bag on my counter for a year and a half.  I never used it.  I do that.  A year and a half.  I'm compulsive.  I don't shop to the point of spending thousands of dollars. 
[00:25:30]  Like, I'll go out and just do something stupid like that and then just never use it  and go, you really are a faggot.  And I don't, you know.  I can see you using your soaps, though.  Yeah.  Then we went to Barnes & Noble and we're all buying books, relatively normal books.  Yeah.  No big deal.  I bought the latest book from the Fight Club author.  I can never say his last name.  Uh-huh.  Was this one, what, 30, 35 pages?  Fight Club was a little thin.  Oh, no, no.  It's longer than that. 
[00:26:00]  And Jimmy finally goes to the checkout counter with his chess books.  Oh.  Put a couple, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Look, intellectual.  Chess problems and the one about chess players and then the confederacy of dunces.  I just wanted to buy some books.  I know, but the chess books, I was, like, just browsing through really fast while he was  online.  I'm like, you're actually going to read this stuff?  I love them.  I'm weird with chess books.  I'll buy a bunch of them and I know I'll never really go through them.  Yeah.  But they're great in the toilet and they're just kind of like, when I can finally, you  know, break away from my stupid computer, my porn sites, I can actually just play  out the moves from the book, which I was killing. 
[00:26:30]  You just sit there reading.  Oh, chess.  But they're actual chess problems and then you've got to, what, try to solve what's happening?  And I'll play some one out of 50.  Oh, he castles here.  Makes perfect sense.  As opposed to going out and banging a girl.  I can just picture him in a lathery bathtub with candles.  Light candles all lit around him.  And then reading his chess problems.  Holding his chess book out of the water.  Yes.  That's fantastic. 
[00:27:00]  That's right.  Just playing a little chess and bad-mouthing the Jews.  Like, you know, Bobby F.  That's sociopath.  Bobby F.  Yeah, I see Fisher interviewed him because Iceland and recubed.  They finally gave him, like, you know, some kind of a place to live now.  They gave him citizenship in Iceland and he's just, he had a press conference recently.  He's like, you know, the fucking Jews, man.  He just hates it.  Oh, yeah, he really does not like the Jews.  And he's half-Jewish.  Yeah.  His mother's Jewish.  God, but it was very interesting in Georgetown last night, Anthony.  It was fun.  We kind of missed you out there.  The National Board of Health and Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and you. 
[00:27:30]  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping.  Just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay.  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight-decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody. 
[00:28:00]  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck?  Like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the face.  XM202, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, where are we at?  We got Jimmy on the phone.  He's in the bathroom.  He's taking his smoothie dump.  Are you forcing, Jimmy?  Dude, I'm just trying to relax.  I haven't dumped much in the last couple of days because I'm a house guest. 
[00:28:30]  But you can bet that smoothie hit my system and it is all coming.  I'm like a tube of toothpaste right now.  And it's lovely.  Disgusting.  Yeah, the smell has finally walked it up.  It's brutal.  All right, listen.  Runaway bride sex stories, Anthony.  Discussing bride's fake story about being abducted by a Mexican man and a white woman.  Oh, yeah.  Remember the runaway bride? 
[00:29:00]  The bug-eyed, howl-eyed looking lady there?  Bug-eyed bride.  Bug-eyed bride.  This is our discussion on that whole thing.  Jimmy, how are you doing?  What the hell was that?  Oh, my God.  He's pissing out his ass.  He's at the pissing out his ass phase.  Are you having explosive diarrhea?  No, I was actually tinkling.  I'm holding the phone by my helmet. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, okay.  I thought you were having one of those moments where you actually piss out your ass.  No, I was starting to cramp during the show, so I'm really happy I'm in here right now.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Have you heard the steamy, seedy description of the runaway bride's sexual encounter?  No.  With the Hispanic man and woman that abducted her?  This is from her story. 
[00:30:00]  It's pretty steamy.  What happened, Ed?  Well, let's see.  They talk about how she was jogging out on the evening of April 26th.  She was grabbed by two individuals, a Hispanic male and white female.  This is from the police report, obviously.  In a van and thrown in the back of it.  Her hands were then tied with rope.  The individuals placed her on her right side on the floor of the van and made her face the back door.  The male then began driving while the female stayed in the back of the van with Jennifer. 
[00:30:30]  After approximately 30 minutes, the male pulled the van off the side of the road and shut the vehicle off.  She's all tied up and wondering, why are we stopping?  Can I jump in really fast?  Sure.  This obviously is her fantasy that she really wants to happen to her.  Absolutely.  This girl is so horny.  So horned up that the fantasy of an abduction has to include this little sexual thing that happened.  All right, go ahead, Ed. 
[00:31:00]  Off the side of the road, the vehicle gets shut off.  The female took off her pants and underwear but left her shirt on.  The female then pulled down Jennifer's pants and underwear, performed oral sex on her,  and digitally penetrated her vagina.  So this couple abducts you and licks your pussy.  This chick rocks.  The girl takes her clothes off and starts going down on you.  Dude, this reminds me of when I was a kid. 
[00:31:30]  I had a bad thing.  I was actually walking, and this girl with a really meaty vagina pulled over and made me get in the car and jerk off looking at her and listening to Ozzy.  Right.  It was horrible.  And then let you off somewhere.  This doesn't happen.  How about stabbed her in the chest a few times and shit on her face?  Ooh.  Ooh.  I'm going to take the band with the good.  Is there more?  Of course.  Oh, good.  Pulled down her pants and underwear, performed oral sex on her, and digitally penetrated her vagina.  The female then moved over Jennifer's head and told her to perform oral sex on her. 
[00:32:00]  At the same time, the male had gone to the back of the van.  He then removed his pants and placed his penis into Jennifer's vagina.  Oh.  According to Jennifer, she performed oral sex on the female until the female had an orgasm.  The male pulled his penis out from Jennifer's vagina once the female had an orgasm.  Jennifer was not sure if the male had ejaculated.  The female and male then dressed themselves and pulled up Jennifer's underwear and pants. 
[00:32:30]  The male then moved to the front of the van and began driving again.  One of the sergeants asked Jennifer if prior to the van stopping, did the male or female make any comments?  Jennifer said they only spoke in Spanish.  Now, this is the investigator trying to trip her story up a little bit.  The sergeant also asked Jennifer if it was dark or lit in the area they had stopped during the sexual assault.  She replied it was dark. 
[00:33:00]  He then asked, if it was dark, how was she able to see the female and male removing their clothing?  Jennifer stated when she was...  Well, look at those eyes of hers.  She sees in the dark, of course.  Of course she does, man.  Those eyes are adapted for the dark.  If only she had thought of that.  She didn't say that.  Look at my eyes, you idiot.  Look at my eyes, you idiot.  Turn the lights out in here and hold up some fingers.  Well, these pupils don't move.  The investigator kept asking her questions.  She kept going, who? 
[00:33:30]  He went, you?  What do you mean all you did was eat wise potato chips?  What are you talking about, miss?  I can't answer that, but I can tell you how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll Center of the Tootsie Pop.  What exactly did the female, um, blah, blah, blah, let me see, Jennifer stated, I lost my spot.  Where was it?  That's all right, Ann, take your time.  Wait a minute, because I still got the nice visual in my head of what she wants done to her.  I guarantee you this is what she did in Vegas with this couple, because she did hang out with a Spanish couple in Vegas. 
[00:34:00]  Darker light.  All right, okay, Jennifer stated, when she was told by the female to perform sex on her, the female placed her vagina over her face.  She could tell the female was only wearing a shirt, because I guess the shirt kind of was hitting her in the face a little bit as she was licking her pussy in this fantasy this woman had.  Oh, God, this guy better marry this broad.  He's got a lot of fun ahead of him. 
[00:34:30]  The sergeant asked Jennifer, what exactly did the female state to you when she wanted you to perform oral sex?  Jennifer said the female told her, now you can lick my pussy.  The sergeant asked if the male or female made any statements to her while the sexual assault was taking place.  She said, no.  The sergeant asked Jennifer if the male was wearing a condom when he penetrated her.  Jennifer replied, she did not know.  Would girls know that or not?  Not necessarily. 
[00:35:00]  Feel a condom?  Let's hope not, because I've been pulling it off for quite a few years.  Yeah, yeah, it's on, it's on.  Sergeant asked Jennifer if she was bound by rope during the entire sexual assault.  Jennifer said, yes.  And the detective asked if Jennifer had penetrated her with any force.  Jennifer said the male did not use any force, but he did not use any foreplay either.  I asked her if she was sexually assaulted at any other time throughout the incident.  She stated no.  After the sexual assault, they began driving again. 
[00:35:30]  She told them she remained lying down and did not sit up.  And then she, they stopped numerous times to get gas and junk food.  She was dropped off in Albuquerque where she made the 911 call.  So that's her little sexual fantasy.  That's the police report.  That rocks.  She told the cops.  And the cops asking her those questions must have just known she was lying.  But the fact that the girl was sitting on her face, that turned me on.  Yeah.  I got like half a rod going.  That's really hot.  I like how it didn't include anything really bad, though. 
[00:36:00]  Like, the guy might have been wearing a condom.  Didn't seem like he even came.  He was just, like, having sex with her until the girl came.  The girl that was sitting on her face.  She's so good at oral sex that she made her cum.  And this kook is...  And then the guy just stopped.  This kook is going to marry this religious nut.  Because now I think he's nutty, too.  How about plowing it into her ass until it bleeds?  How about that?  Now, that's a rape.  That's not her fantasy, Anthony.  That's not her fantasy.  She's into the threesome.  Why didn't he put his uncut gift into her face when he was finished? 
[00:36:30]  Right.  The husband-to-be had to read this police report.  He must have been out of his mind.  We'll pray together and hopefully get through this with prayer.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Pray together.  What you need to do is get another chick to squat on her face.  She's probably already licked some box in the loony bin.  She's been in the shower with another nut.  Room handles.  And they're scrubbing each other's faces.  One of them kneels on some flip-flops. 
[00:37:00]  We heard they do that.  Yeah, we have.  Oh, the story just gets better and better.  It's pretty hot.  That's off the smoking pot.  You know, the religious family had to read the police report going, oh, my God.  They had to read everything.  Are you kidding me?  They had to read everything.  We thought our son found the perfect woman.  They don't want this woman now.  And now we're going to have to deal with this.  Just the fact that she had the ability to make up this perverted crap.  The family would go, oh, no way.  She did that.  She did that in Vegas. 
[00:37:30]  I guarantee.  You think that's it?  She did hook up an Hispanic guy and a white woman.  That is exactly what she did.  And that's what happened somewhere.  She's probably a nympho that was trying to change her ways and then realized, oh, my God.  I just can't do this.  I need sex.  I need sex.  I need that cock.  I need the cock.  And just went.  Started contacting the old boyfriends.  That wasn't working out too well.  And then maybe in Vegas ran into a couple like this.  Maybe.  That's why you go to Vegas. 
[00:38:00]  That is why a woman like this would run off to Vegas.  Where can I go in the United States where I could just probably hook up with a couple of people and have some sex?  Ah, Sin City, Vegas.  There you go.  She ends up there, hooks up with this couple, Hispanic guy and a woman.  And they probably did exactly this.  She probably sat on her face.  Guy's banging her.  Oh, he probably had her legs pinned back.  Just looking at this owl-eyed whore eat his girlfriend.  Oh, God. 
[00:38:30]  Let's say hi to George in New Jersey.  George?  Morning, guys.  Morning.  Hey, the cops knew this wasn't real the minute she said the other girl came on her face and the guy didn't blow a load.  Exactly.  Stop it.  I'm out.  All right.  Big eyes.  Is that just hitting the press?  The police report finally?  I don't know.  It's on the smoking gun.  I don't know how long it's been here.  All right.  Let's go to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass?  We love Ben's raw ass.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I got a little funny story for you. 
[00:39:00]  Uh-oh.  Hold on, hold on.  Is it a funny story?  Let's put our laughing hats on.  You guys ready for a funny story from Ben's raw ass?  They're clapping, applauding in the other room.  They're ready to go.  All right.  I was trying to hook up with this religious chick once, right?  And so was my friend at the same time.  So she said she was going to have to pray to God to tell her which guy to go out with, right?  Yeah.  Needless to say, she didn't pick me, but she also didn't put out.  So he ended up raping her. 
[00:39:30]  Wait a minute.  Is that actually...  I got to disagree with the boys.  That was funny and hot.  Okay.  Good story, sir.  All right.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Funny story?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's a bit where we talked about retards swimming with dolphins.  Dummies. 
[00:40:00]  You guys aren't going to add to that?  Oh, no.  It was fine.  You explained it perfectly.  Yeah, but that was just a setup.  And then, like, we have a little cute back and forth talk.  I say we leave it like that.  Just like that?  Why not?  Just like that.  What is it to say?  I mean, sometimes the title says it retards with dolphins.  How do you add to that?  And then sometimes what you read afterwards, if you elaborate on it, it kind of ruins the bit  because we talk about it in the...  Who writes these up?  In the discussion.  Who writes these up?  Oh, look at Eric having no problem throwing Danny under the bus.  He must fax him in since he's not here anymore.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  He always puts, like, little punchlines.  Story about retards swimming with dolphins is supposed to be therapeutic.  Goofing on Flipper and SeaWorld whales trying to jump over their big water heads.  Now, that's funny.  I've got to sit back and listen to this.  Yeah.  It's funny in the context of the bit.  Yes.  Not written on a page.  What do you want to say, Jim?  Nice meals.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  There's some sexual reference.  Live on the Today Show, there's some genetic disaster.  Oh, poor kid.  Are changing the lives of some pretty special kids. 
[00:41:00]  Special.  It's a place where we celebrate ability, not disability.  Some is called a therapist.  Others come just for the fun.  Alicia Danoon is in remission now.  She had a brain tumor when she was three.  All right.  You know what?  I'm turning off you.  Oh, God.  I didn't want to be tempted.  Why?  She didn't remission.  That's good.  I didn't want to be tempted.  The cute girl petting a dolphin down there in Florida.  Got a bad brain tumor.  God bless her. 
[00:41:30]  Let her be.  Look at that little swimsuit on her.  Thanks, Mom, for that nice genetic handoff.  A brain tumor at three.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Can't be harmful.  Yeah.  Must have been my smoking, Mom.  Let a three-year-old get a brain tumor front.  From Mom doing dope.  Nice smile.  Here's a softball on your brain stem, kid.  Get headaches until you're 40.  Oh, Jesus.  It is cruel, and there is no God, and I don't want to hear an argument about it.  Yeah.  What did this kid do to deserve a softball tumor? 
[00:42:00]  A brain tumor.  Brain tumor.  In her little head.  And now she gets to pet a dolphin.  Swim with a dolphin.  Hits him with that bottlenose right in the tumor.  Jeez.  The dolphin, like, goes, can smell the sickness.  You're just, like, dolphin noises they make.  Tries to beach the kid and kill it.  Yeah.  So it doesn't...  Yeah.  I smell the sickness on you.  We must beach you.  The kid has no clue that she's...  I'd beach you.  There's a ring around the head.  Whatever the thing is. 
[00:42:30]  Oh.  The yeast dolphin.  She's not sure if she's petting a dolphin or a goat.  Take her to a petting zoo, for God's sake.  Mommy, why is the goat in the water?  It's all right, Puddin' Head.  It's a dolphin.  Puddin' Head.  Oh, is that a horrible Puddin' Head.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[00:43:00]  Very good.  Ah.  Ah.  Children and their families that needed this.  Fifteen years later, Dina's Island Dolphin Care is the largest non-profit program of its kind.  Recently, they moved into a $2 million facility.  Oh, nice.  A museum of sorts.  And take pride in rich stories.  Oh, God, that was a nice picture.  It would be funny if you get a little shirt for the kids.  I went to the dolphin farm and all I got was this lousy gene pool. 
[00:43:30]  I'm going to swim with the dolphin.  Okay, dear.  Be back later.  Get up later.  Why do dolphins get pegged with these jobs these days?  You think the dolphins sitting there like, oh, Jesus.  Why can't it be that hot stripper blonde that's on vacation with the other ladies from Hooters?  I used to strap mines to my head and I put them to enemy boats. 
[00:44:00]  Now I got to play with this special child.  He's drooling on me.  Oh.  I remember this.  Isn't this the theme to Flipper?  They call him Flipper.  Flipper.  Swimming with retards.  Swimming with retards.  The one you see is smarter than me.  Smarter than him.  Not the kids he's swimming with. 
[00:44:30]  Balancing their heads on his nose because he thinks it's a big dumb ball.  When I look under the sea.  Everyone loves the king of the sea.  Oh, Jesus.  It's so good.  This is nice music.  Tricks he will do.  Tricks.  Children are near.  Tries to jump over his big head, but it's too big.  Crashes into the ear and falls back. 
[00:45:00]  Sneaks under and bites the kid's foot for making him look bad.  Dolphin almost dies because the kid's big tongue gets stuck in his blowhole.  I can't breathe, kid.  Dolphin.  Puppy.  Kitten.  Yeah, right.  Okay. 
[00:45:30]  That's why the dolphin's jumping out of the water.  He's just saying, get me away from this retard.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, that's mean.  That is really mean.  They're trying to do something nice and we're mocking it.  I don't mean it.  That's why there's a three-month wait to swim with the dolphins.  Is there really?  You can't get close to the dolphins anymore.  Where?  Here?  That's all the rage down there in Florida.  It is all the rage.  People love swimming with dolphins.  You go to that.  You're on vacation.  You go to the resort there and you try to sign up for the dolphin excursion. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, that's booked six months in advance.  I'm not saying it's inconvenient to have that in your family, but I know there's some parents  trying to start it, but instead of a dolphin, it's a shark.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Swim with the shark.  Swim with the shark.  It's a dolphin, honey.  Yeah, pet this, you photograph ruiner.  You guys, we got a quickie.  It's only a minute and 15 seconds. 
[00:46:30]  I saw a friend of mine, Dally Dooley, once.  Thought he was sleeping.  Gave him a nudge and his tongue was bitten in two.  Still plenty of it for three men, though.  Let's drink to the dumb look on your face.  Here's to swimming with Down syndrome, women.  Sharks in the water.  Retard goes in the water.  I'll retard.  Farewell and Ado to your brain-damaged child. 
[00:47:00]  I'll educate him, but it's going to take $10,000.  So we need a rocking chair once, not the shark, the kid.  Uh, boys, you're going to need a bigger hat. 
[00:47:30]  Very good.  Look out.  There it comes.  I'm Chrissy.  Yes, well, you know, we're all going to hell, of course.  Instant feedback, like people are telling us anything new.  That's horrific.  Good.  I've had the time of my life, now I've never felt this way before. 
[00:48:00]  Yes, I swear, it's the truth, and I know it all to you.  Cause I've had the time of my life, now I've always felt the view.  I've been waiting for so long, now I've finally found this fun to stay by me. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, we're riding on the wall, and you've felt the magic called fantasy.  Yeah, we're rushing in our lives, and it's a way we couldn't decide secretly.  Something so young, the wind, because I'mAA11.  It could change.  In reality. 
[00:49:00]  Don't we take it, each other's hands, don't we only understand the mastery.  Just remember you're the only thing thing.  Yeah, yeah, no, no.  So I tell you something that's gonna be long now.  Because I am at the top of my mind  That I never felt like it was before  Yes, I swear it's the truth that I hold you 
[00:49:30]  Hey, baby!  And my body and soul, God, you know  That you never know  So don't just let it go  Be afraid to lose control  No 
[00:50:00]  You have noise on your mind  You say, stay with me tonight  For me, stay with me  All the one day  I can't get enough of  So I'll tell you something  This time belongs  Because I am at the time of my life 
[00:50:30]  No, I never felt like it was before  But I am there  It's the truth that I hold you  I'm there  All the one night  I have the time of my life  And I can't get enough of  I can't get enough of  But I don't know  And I can't get enough of 
[00:51:00]  I can't get enough of  Thank you. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you. 
[00:52:00]  Thank you. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The alcoholic father.  This next bit is very, very sad.  From the makers of Diary of an Unborn Fetus with Lil, what's his name? 
[00:53:00]  Lil Marky?  Lil Marky.  Marky.  Yeah.  He talked about how he was a fetus and how he loved his mommy and daddy and wanted to come  out finally and meet his mommy.  And he gave a month-by-month explanation of how he was growing.  And at the end, in a comic twist, he gets yanked out in an abortion.  Yes.  Yes.  In this one, Lil Marky has an alcoholic father.  And see what tragedies unfold because of that in this bit. 
[00:53:30]  The alcoholic father.  Dun-dun!  Ow.  That hurt.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, jeez.  The worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Where's Martini Steve?  Is this good?  We finally got the story of an alcoholic father.  All right, let's get the fucking R-gang shorts wearing psychopath in here.  It says, mostly very preachy and religious.  Very spanky and religious. 
[00:54:00]  R-gang.  Jesus.  Look at your R-gang shorts.  Hey, Weezer.  I like that.  That's great.  You've got the biggest shorts ever.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  See, that's a little bit of fabric.  You've got massive shorts on.  Massive legs.  You're a big guy.  You really are.  I feel like you have linebacker cabs.  I do.  I work out.  What's going on with this?  What's going on with this thing?  It's not as to the point as the first one, but it had some good need in it. 
[00:54:30]  It's 14 minutes long.  I took two of the tracks.  One of them centers around an outburst from the alcoholic father.  And the second one is kind of a surprise ending.  I don't want to ruin it.  Oh, I like surprises.  Anybody else?  Yeah, sure.  Perhaps, let's try to guess.  A fatal car crash.  Don't tell us.  Don't tell us.  I'm going to guess a fatal car crash.  I'm going to guess dad is late for work one day and decides to get help. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, really?  You're looking at the good thing.  I'm going to guess sodomy.  I mean, that would be a hot ending, not a surprise.  Either car crash or he pushes mom down the stairs.  Something violent.  I'm going to guess he's carrying scissors and he sneezes and accidentally gives mom a mastectomy.  A mastectomy.  Well, here's the first track.  Let's listen in.  My daddy was one of the last people called an alcoholic.  He used to drink so much. 
[00:55:30]  At first he didn't.  He'd go to a party and one of those business kind, you know, and all the guys around said,  come on, Bob, take a drink or two.  He said, no, thank you.  Oh, come on.  Don't be one of those freaks.  So daddy said, in order not to be unsociable, he went ahead and take a drink.  Well, he kept drinking more and more, more parties and more drinks.  Sounds like fun.  Why did daddy have a drink before he got up in the morning?  After he got home? 
[00:56:00]  Before he got up in the morning?  How the fuck?  Did daddy have an IV by the bed?  I drank before he woke up.  And what would he say when he drank?  My kid sounds like a chipmunk.  My kid sounds like that fetus I had aborted.  Who the hell is that?  Yeah.  He pulled through, old hanger head.  Bastard, who saw that coming?  Last time I go to that doctor.  Old doctor, Nike in the stomach.  That's who you got to call. 
[00:56:30]  You know, it went well when there's a tread print on her belly.  Wait, what's that?  Air Jordans, why is that on your belly?  Medical procedure.  My daddy jumped up and down on her belly until I shot across the wall.  Shot across the room, I should have said.  You know, old litty.  Get rid of that old inconvenience.  The old, we can't go to Atlantic City this weekend.  Yeah, jumping up and down on her stomach yelling,  18 years of financial freedom, coming up. 
[00:57:00]  Vacations to places that don't have Ferris wheels, coming up.  We don't have to take separate flights anymore.  Coming up.  Coming up.  Lace it up tight. 
[00:57:30]  Here it comes.  Lace it up.  Set those buckets up, honey.  Let's make this fun.  Steve, don't encourage him.  It's the coming up.  Coming up.  That really sells it.  Well, he's just trying to make his wife feel a little bit better,  like this is something we're accomplishing.  It's a good thing.  That's right. 
[00:58:00]  All right, let's go back to this thing.  All right, dinner, after dinner, we go to bed.  That's how bad it would do.  Well, Mr. Dad, I said, Daddy, I wish you could save.  He said, I made me alone.  I said, Daddy, please.  I said, Jesus, to come in your heart and save you.  I said, quit it.  I said, Daddy, if you don't get saved, you're going to go to hell.  You don't get saved?  There's a whole religious thing going on here, huh?  Yeah, these are, I did a little bit of research. 
[00:58:30]  These are done by, the character's called Little Marky,  and they're a bunch of Christian records.  Little Marky.  Little Marky.  And, yeah, they're all very preachy,  so you've got to sift through all that preachy stuff  to get to the actual funny parts.  We're just a bunch of jerks.  I like Little Marky.  Little Marky.  I wonder if he wears little boxers like Marky Marky,  shows off those little abs,  still has that little thing coming out of his belly button. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, I shouldn't have said that.  Oh, boy.  Daddy got up, and he started chasing me around the living room.  He told me, if I didn't watch it, I was going to get you.  I said, Daddy, please don't hit me.  He took a ball back, and he started to swing,  and Mama came out right outside my kitchen door  just at the same time.  Daddy swung him.  If he hit me, he hit my mama.  I like this guy.  Oh, this guy's a real go-getter. 
[00:59:30]  Save my ass.  Hand me that bat boy.  Oh.  Chase the little Marky.  And then Scatman Crothers came in,  and he hit him in the chest.  Daddy's book was really redundant.  Mama tried to find me  and saw a bunny rabbit blowing another man.  I was quite a willful young boy.  I needed to be corrected. 
[01:00:00]  So did Mommy.  Thanks, bro.  Oh.  The drunk swings a towering high fly ball deep to center field.  Mom's head goes over the fence.  He caught it?  Oh, wait.  I thought it was a home run.  And he hit her.  And he hit her.  And he hit her again.  Mom didn't move for a long time. 
[01:00:30]  I thought she went to go to heaven.  Well, after Mommy got out of the hospital,  Daddy promised he'd be a good boy.  Oh, he'd go to church Sunday morning, Sunday night,  Wednesday night prayer meeting,  Thursday night meditation.  There was no other job.  I thought my daddy was a Christian.  Oh, I wouldn't say happy.  Oh, my God.  You just want to kill the whole family.  Oh.  Ugh.  So the wife didn't leave.  The stupid wife.  He beats her almost to death with a baseball bat. 
[01:01:00]  Put her in the hospital.  Put her in the hospital.  And she doesn't leave.  Because he promises to go to church.  Yeah, well, she shouldn't have swung the bat at him on the steps.  Backing up in that hotel.  Like, that's where he got it.  Stay away.  I'm very confused.  And Daddy said she's had her whole fucking life to think things over.  And wondered what a few minutes more was going to do her now.  She hit Daddy and dragged him to the meat locker. 
[01:01:30]  And then Grady came to the door and he was very angry.  He said Daddy didn't have the stomach for him.  But he said he'd do better if he just let him out.  Then he grabbed an axe.  And, well, you already heard Jimmy say Scammy and Crowther's got it in the chest.  Oh.  He's angry. 
[01:02:00]  That creepy music.  I have two little twin girls to play with.  Boy, are they creepy.  After Daddy beat Mommy, she looked like the woman in the tub.  All swollen.  We've got to hear more of what happens.  All right.  It's the greatest opening theme in movie history.  With the car driving up the mountain.  Oh, it's the best music ever.  All right.  It got kind of rough around the house, Daddy. 
[01:02:30]  Didn't let me and Mommy go to church very much.  Uh-oh.  Once Sunday night, it got so bad, we had to sneak out of the house.  Oh, we went to the service and it was so great.  The singing was tremendous and the preaching was bad.  Mom and I started home and we were so happy.  But yet, it was so burdened for Daddy.  Uh-oh.  Here it comes.  What happened now?  Here it comes.  There's always irony with these things. 
[01:03:00]  All I know is they went.  The father said he was going to go to church.  He was going to be a good guy after beating up the wife with the baseball bat.  Going to his meeting.  Going to the meeting.  Going to church.  Then he starts falling back into his old bad habits.  He's drinking again.  Didn't go to church.  But the mother and the son go to church.  And all I know is right now, they're done.  They had a great time at church.  And are they driving home?  I believe they were driving home.  Who's driving?  Was it Dad?  No, I think the mom's driving. 
[01:03:30]  See, the ironic thing would be if they got hit by a drunk driver.  Oh, that would be great.  You know?  Please let it happen.  Could be.  We were so burdened for our Daddy.  We opened the door.  Nope.  And there was Daddy's seat in his favorite chair again.  Is he dead?  Uh-oh.  Is his favorite chair?  Is Daddy dead?  Dad's in his favorite chair.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Who is this?  He was just drinking. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, no.  He was drinking.  And he was drunk.  Oh.  Mommy walked over to him and she said,  Honey, when are you going to get your life straightened down and accept Jesus?  She deserves another faithful bet.  He said, leave me alone.  I couldn't believe my ears.  I said, Daddy, you promised Mommy and me you would never drink again.  Why did you do it?  I said, leave me alone. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, Daddy, I'm going to pray for you, Daddy.  And my father said something I never heard him say.  I said, fuck you, you little fucking fucker.  Said something he never heard him say.  What do you think he said, Jimmy?  Um, hmm.  Stop talking, kid, and put this in your mouth.  At least I hope that's what he said.  What could he have possibly said?  Um, Mommy's sleeping now. 
[01:05:00]  Help me drag her to the tub and get that chainsaw.  And get those garbage bags.  Oh, my God.  I hope that's what he said.  What did he say?  I don't know.  It could be, I hate you.  Maybe he said, son.  Drinking's more fun.  Son, you and your brother get in the minivan.  Mommy's taking you for a lift.  He said, you have to go to the Steinbergs. 
[01:05:30]  Joel and Hedda are going to babysit you.  Quick, baby-killing parents.  Oh, hmm.  There's such a shortage of them.  We got audio of what he said, I guess.  Yeah, let's, I gotta, I gotta know what he said.  We're all wandering and waiting here.  I think this is what he said.  Yeah, if that queued up, I would have it.  Ooh.  All right, well, we'll go back to this then.  I hate you.  Yes, I hate you.  And I hate you, mother.  And I hate everybody.  I hate God. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, God, I don't say that.  I do.  I love the little son of a bitch.  I went to my bedroom and fell to the bed and broke it.  And I was laying down.  I said, Jesus, we got pretty close, my man.  I said, this is your buddy, Mommy.  Speak to me at the end.  Did you hear my daddy out of the living room?  He said he hates Mommy.  He hates me.  And he hates you.  Oh, Jesus, I'd do anything to see my daddy saved. 
[01:06:30]  Please save him.  Oh.  In Jesus' name.  Oh.  Your daddy is a waste.  Accept it.  Deal with it.  Your daddy's a drunk.  Your daddy is a sot and a sodomite.  And I cried myself to sleep that night.  I woke up the next morning.  I had a big pain in my chest.  I said, Daddy, Mommy, come here, quick. 
[01:07:00]  He ran in.  What's wrong?  Oh, my chest hurts so bad.  I said, will you stay home from Christian school today?  Christian school.  I said, all right.  I stayed home.  And as the day went on, the horse I got fired.  I called a Christian doctor and he examined me.  Marky.  Oh.  Oh, it's so bad.  He has a broken heart over here.  Marky.  Oh, yes, sir. 
[01:07:30]  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  What?  What?  Oh, yeah.  Who saw this coming?  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  I know what happened.  And little Marky and his mother apparently raped and killed this guy's wife and daughter.  And he's asking, do you believe in Jesus?  Well, you're going to meet him.  You're going to meet him.  Oh, no.  Let's see.  Could it be fetal alcohol syndrome? 
[01:08:00]  No.  No.  I don't know.  This kid's 11 already.  Yeah, sure.  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  You mean I'm going to die?  He said, yes.  Well, I'm ready to go see Jesus.  But my daddy's not.  He said, I think you better call your mommy and daddy in right now.  And I said, daddy, mama, they walked in and they were supposed to cry. 
[01:08:30]  I said, daddy, the doctor said I'm going to go see Jesus tonight.  And I'm so happy because I love Jesus and we're good friends for daddy.  I love you for your kid.  Daddy said, why?  I'm a good man.  Daddy, the Bible says I'll have sinned and come join the glory of God.  And because you're sinned away, you can send his death, daddy.  But the gift of God is eternal life.  He gives it to you freely, daddy. 
[01:09:00]  And I, too, couldn't.  Mommy, too, can't.  We've been wanting you to take over, daddy.  You wouldn't do it.  Of course he's drinking.  Listen to this shit.  Daddy, please don't go to hell.  I love you.  Daddy started crying very bad.  We moved back a little bit.  I said, mama, please come here.  I could barely talk in a whisper.  My mama knelt down beside my mouth and she said, honey, what? 
[01:09:30]  I said, mama, I'll see you in heaven, okay?  Okay.  Okay, honey.  I said, mommy, you pray for daddy, okay?  Okay.  I think daddy's going to get saved.  Okay.  Daddy, come here, daddy.  What?  What?  Daddy, why am I so slow and so slow?  He looked down at me. 
[01:10:00]  I just followed.  Take my hand and I reached out to him.  And he grabbed my little hand.  My little.  But he's holding so tight.  I'll give daddy.  Don't pull my fucking hand up.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I said, choke yourself.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I said, choke yourself.  At least more, choke yourself. 
[01:10:30]  Well.  No shit.  What happened to the kid?  He died.  From what?  Yeah, but what did he have?  I don't know.  He had something wrong with him.  He got a pain?  They called a Christian doctor to the house.  We're at the little house on the prairie.  You don't take the kid to the hospital or nothing.  What's that got to do with the father's drinking?  The father's drinking.  I don't know, man.  It just takes a wild left turn about seven minutes into a 14-minute clip.  It's some kind of redemption thing.  See, the kid's fine with dying.  And he was going to go see his pal Jesus.  But he'll never get to see his father again because his father doesn't believe in Jesus. 
[01:11:00]  And he's going to another place.  He's going to hell.  And basically...  If that isn't a commercial for hell, I don't know what is.  If you don't believe in Jesus, you don't get to see the rest of your family that believes in Jesus when they die.  Maybe if Jesus had a little compassion, he'd fucking ask the father who's drinking and kicking the shit out of the mother.  And let the kid have a few years.  Yeah, really?  Maybe Jesus should cut the malarkey.  The Lord works in mysterious ways.  He sure does.  That are really fucked up and unfair.  Daddy, are you going to go to hell?  I'm already in it. 
[01:11:30]  You sound like Marion, kid.  I'm going to be out of hell in about five minutes when your heart stops beating.  Take that awful blue room and change it into an office.  Coming up.  Steve, don't encourage him.  That's funny.  Out with Disney, in with Vegas.  He's doing math in the head.  All right, $35 for this.  Flowers, little coffin, burial.  A little coffin.  A little Marky's coffin. 
[01:12:00]  Wow, that's...  That's something, huh?  People are really disturbed by the fact that they're trying to convert someone using complete guilt.  Yeah, wasn't this kid killed a while back?  Well, that's right.  This kid never had a life.  This kid is just...  I don't know what...  He's amazing.  He dies at the end of every skit.  He's like Kenny.  Yeah.  I think Bob Kelly's at home right now blubbering into his...  Oh, Bob is just crying.  He's blubbering into his afghan. 
[01:12:30]  When the little kid said, hold my hand, I understood.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  There's a hanger in my head, dude.  There's a hanger in my head, dude.  I didn't see the kid dropping dead.  Not again.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are we rolling?  We are rolling.  Yes, it's Opie, it's Anthony.  Look at this. 
[01:13:00]  It's almost like the old days, Opie.  It's just the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kind of like this.  That's it.  It's just us here.  There's no guests, no Jimmy, nothing.  No producers.  Nothing.  I have to get your coffee, you know.  Yeah.  I like this a lot.  You want to jerk off?  No, thank you.  No?  Hey, let's see who's got the biggest dick.  No one else is here to see.  Yeah.  It'll just be you and me, eh? 
[01:13:30]  Remember that time in L.A.?  What, Opie?  Don't talk about that.  I know.  I know.  Well, I'm not going to finish the story, screw it.  Let them try to figure it out.  Don't.  In the meantime, the fine mayor of New York City decided that he needed to hit the Spanish audience,  so he made a Spanish commercial.  Yeah, Spanish language, trying to get his voting audience up.  Yeah, so a light bulb went on in our heads, and we decided, you know, we could reach more 
[01:14:00]  listeners as well if we started doing bits in Spanish.  Why not?  So that's what we did.  Here's Opie and Anthony, when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  Anyway, let's get the Bill's Dead thing out of the way again.  Yeah.  Now, to explain, we were talking about the mayor of New York City yesterday.  He's making commercials for Hispanics.  Well, he wants to win another term as mayor.  He's got a shitload of money. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, the guy's a billionaire, so he can spend it, and he can spend it like other candidates  can't.  He could go for the niche advertising of himself.  You know, it costs a lot to make a commercial, and to make one in Spanish that just, you know,  exclusively for Spanish people, that might not be good for somebody on a limited budget.  You want to cover as much ground as you can, but Bloomberg can just, it doesn't matter.  He can speak Yiddish to get to the Hasidics.  You know, he's one of those guys who can spend all that money, and that's what he did, and  he did one completely in Spanish. 
[01:15:00]  And it sounded like he didn't really know how to speak the language.  Of course he didn't.  He just read it phonetically.  He read it phonetically.  So Anthony and I came up with a cute little idea, a quick idea, that maybe we should translate  some of our better bits into Spanish for the...  Maybe we'll get some Spanish listeners that way.  For the Spanish-speaking audience.  Imagine they're just tuning around the dial XM, and they hear all of a sudden some Spanish  coming out.  And go, oh, what's this?  I think XM is launching a Spanish station, or a couple of them, or something like that.  So maybe we could, you know, give this bit to the Spanish station on XM. 
[01:15:30]  And they could play it a few times.  So the only way this is going to make sense is to play the Bill's Dead phone call again.  I know it's kind of overplayed, but it is one of our favorites.  Yeah.  Basically, this old lady called one of the old stations we worked at.  Wrong number.  Wrong number, and we messed with her a little bit by telling her her dear friend Bill was  dead.  A little bit.  So we're going to play the original, and then we'll come back for a quick second, and we'll  play the Spanish version.  All right.  All right.  But first year is the original. 
[01:16:00]  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Uh, well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Uh, Bill, uh, Bill died today.  Yeah, kid, oh my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Oh, who is this?  Who is this? 
[01:16:30]  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Well, where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pile up. 
[01:17:00]  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  So, there's the original Bill's Dead call.  Uh-huh.  Now, uh, here's that same bit in Spanish.  Yeah.  Hey, it's making us chuckle today.  Listen for Who Is Is This? 
[01:17:30]  Listen for our awful Spanish.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Bill's Dead in Spanish.  Hola.  Hola.  Hola.  Hola.  Guillermo.  ¿Quién es esto?  Patricio.  Patricio, ¿cómo estás?  No estoy hablando con el Guillermo equivocando.  Ah, pues, Patricio, yo tengo malas noticias.  ¿Qué?  Ah, Guillermo se murió hoy. 
[01:18:00]  Estoy brumando.  Ay, Dios mío.  Sí.  ¿Qué tragedia?  ¿Quién es esto?  Él estuvo en un accidente de cotto.  I know.  I know.  ¿Quién es esto?  Esto es Juan.  Juan?  Sí.  Sí.  Sí.  Sí.  Dios mío, yo no lo creo. 
[01:18:30]  Sí.  Pedro, yo estaba hablando con él hace mucho.  Yo sé.  ¿Cuándo peso esto?  Esta tarde.  ¿A dónde?  En la carretera.  Ay, que Dios lo quiera.  Sí, grande, grande, ok. 
[01:19:00]  Pues esto sí creo que la de los hijos al pacín.  Pues me tengo que ir.  Está bien, Juan.  Está bien.  Gracias.  Hasta luego.  Hasta luego.  No.  No, ya está. 
[01:19:30]  No.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  So stupid.  You can pick up on a few of the classic lines.  Donde.  Just to know.  Donde.  Donde.  Donde.  It's a bit twice as long because we have to try to do it in Spanish.  I know.  Our awful Spanish.  Un accidento.  Un.  Un.  Un.  Un.  Un.  Are you French?  Well, I took a little French too in high school, so I got it all mixed up, I guess. 
[01:20:00]  Rubbed off a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  All right.  Well, there you have that.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here we go, guys.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and we're going to do a little bit here where,  I don't know.  Good one.  It's a great intro.  What happened?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  While at Anthony's apartment, O and Air listening to a phone scanner and scanning the, scaring 
[01:20:30]  the woman who lives on the first floor.  She got so freaked out.  She invited the guy over she was talking to and got laid.  Yeah.  This is actually a really funny bit.  What is that?  I don't remember it.  Well, you know, people have listened to scanners for many, many years.  I used to have a scanner, and I would listen to, you know, police calls and stuff like  that.  But one little thing I noticed is I could get cellular phone calls on it.  So I would listen to people on their cell phones and cordless phones in your house.  So the woman downstairs from me was listening, was using a cordless phone, and we were upstairs 
[01:21:00]  listening to her conversation.  And we figured we could make it interactive by making noises upstairs and doing things  outside that would get her to talk on the phone and get a reaction.  And this is us talking about that very instance in much more detail with much more of a comic  element to it.  Oh, wow.  I would hope.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:21:30]  We have a real good scanner story that we haven't told in a while.  Oh, my God.  I have a scanner.  I've had one for years.  And, yeah, you can pick up cell phones and cordless phones.  And the conversations I've heard over the years, hysterical.  I was out in the Hamptons once listening to phone calls.  And a couple of, you know, gay guys talking on the phone, you know, as they were gay guys.  Now, they were talking about fisting. 
[01:22:00]  Really?  Yeah.  It was hysterical.  Sitting there, like, listening to this guy going, you know, I'll bury it up to the elbow.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wow.  Heard breakups, drug deals, affairs.  It was great entertainment.  You'd have to sift through all the crap, you know.  I'll be home in an hour, honey.  Oh, great.  Good call.  Tell them about the call we heard that one night.  Oh, what?  Up in the apartment?  Yeah.  We're all hanging out, drinking at Anthony's place, checking out the scanner. 
[01:22:30]  Up in Boston, yeah.  Checking out the scanner, you know, and got a nice strong signal.  Heard some girl talking on the phone.  And she's talking to some guy about how her boyfriend sucks and how she kind of wants to get together with this guy and blah, blah, blah.  So, at one point, we're listening to the scanner, but we're also joking around and laughing.  And at one point, I guess, we were laughing and I slammed the floor with my foot. 
[01:23:00]  Opie stomped on the floor.  You know how you do that?  Because I was laughing so hard, right?  A real knee slapper type thing.  So, all of a sudden, the girl on the phone that we're listening to on the scanner goes,  Oh, people upstairs again, banging.  Like, holy jeez, it's that person downstairs.  And then she starts going,  Oh, it's not the first time.  They walk around up there like elephants.  I think they must weigh 500 pounds.  And then she starts saying, 
[01:23:30]  Now, this is me, Jen, Opie, and his girlfriend, Sandy.  Right.  Sitting there.  I think there was another couple there, too.  Making it more embarrassing.  And we hadn't been on the air long together,  so it's not like we had a friendship, really a good friendship.  You know what I mean?  We were still getting to know each other.  We were still getting to know each other.  This goes way back.  Go ahead.  So, then she's like,  And their bedroom is right over mine.  So, all I'm hearing at night is,  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:24:00]  Boom, boom, boom.  The bed.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I just heard Pete ran.  I'm looking.  Opie's laughing his ass off.  All night long.  Oh, it's disgusting.  Right.  I'm like, oh, well, maybe it's not downstairs.  But it was downstairs.  It was, because then we started effing with her.  Because then we decided to play interactive phone call. 
[01:24:30]  It was, I believe it was Halloween night.  Right.  So, um, she was kind of scared to be alone.  She was talking to this guy.  Well, and, I mean, your apartment complex, pretty much everyone was scared to be alone.  Oh, my God.  Halloween night.  Well, when you look outside and you see somebody just bagged a zebra and were dragging it back into their, uh, lean-to.  I was in a bad neighborhood, man.  When it would rain, I swear to you.  When it rained?  When it rained, it was the highlight of the day for the six billion little children that lived there. 
[01:25:00]  Because they could play in the pothole puddles.  It was like a little pool for them.  I was just waiting for one of them to go to the shores of one of the puddles and have a croc come and grab him.  Drag him in.  I swear, this neighborhood.  There was, there were people.  It was an apartment building.  Right.  Outside of the little porch of your apartment, someone had fenced off a whole area, planted grass, and was raising chickens. 
[01:25:30]  I swear to you.  It was the community property.  Yeah, it was.  Like, he took up three people's backyards, because no one had a yard.  He had a cement patio with a wrought iron fence around it.  That's your yard.  This guy decides, you know, hey, I'm going to make a fence.  I'm going to make a fence and raise a chicken, just like I did back in Puerto Rico.  And they would fence off the area. 
[01:26:00]  Beautiful lawn.  I mean, he had it well kept.  Raising chickens.  So freaking funny.  Frightening neighborhood.  The second I moved in, like, what floor do you want to stay in?  What's the top one?  I want the high ground.  Love the high ground.  Every night, the police were there.  There was something going on.  Some domestic dispute going on.  Someone's head was going through a wall.  It was wonderful.  So we're listening to the lady downstairs on the scanner.  So she's kind of scared, and she's talking to this guy.  So we decide to go out onto the porch, which is right above her porch, three high, and throw 
[01:26:30]  things at her sliding glass door from our porch.  So we're taking little pieces of candy and stuff and leaning over and winging it.  So we hear it hit the door and hear her go, oh, my God, what was that?  It was just so much fun because we're listening to the conversation and controlling what she's  saying.  Then we decide we're going to ring her buzzer and run.  So it was down on the first floor.  I'm on the third floor.  So Opie goes downstairs to the buzzer. 
[01:27:00]  And after coaxing him for a half hour, come on, you got to do it.  You got to do it.  Buzz is it.  I hear him start running up the stairs.  You can hear it on the phone.  On the phone.  Yeah.  And then I just hear this horrible.  He tripped going up the stairs.  Some getaway because she was on the second floor.  So we had to run past her floor to get back upstairs before she opened the door.  Because we were paranoid, convinced that if she opened up her door and I'm just casually  walking like I'm there visiting you, that she was going to bust us. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  You know.  And it turns out the whole end to this whole thing is we got the guy late.  Yeah.  Because she got so scared at what was going on.  She said, you better come over here.  And he's like, oh, really?  She was like, yeah, I'm very scared.  Well, it's important to the story.  The guy talking to this lady was trying to pick her up the whole time.  Yeah.  And she's like, no, no, you know, kind of give him the brush off.  My boyfriend's driving by.  We got her so freaked out by the end of the conversation.  Yeah.  She invited him over for the night.  Scanners are fun, though, man.  They used to have a blast with those things. 
[01:28:00]  That's a great story.  Forgot all about that.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Ah, we talk about the River Rose.  Ah, the River Rose.  Our buddy Billy Mac has a party boat.  Charters it out for people.  Jimmy really shines when we talk about gay subjects.  So sit back and enjoy it.  Jimmy excitedly talks about the gay cruise.  I'm not going on it.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Should we talk about the cruise now or what? 
[01:28:30]  Oh, I can't wait.  Here we go.  That's what I need.  To take off the sting of my stunning defeat, I need to go for a ride on the River Rose.  The River Rose.  That's where you do some spinning, but it's with a mule between your ass cheeks.  What the hell is the River Rose?  I don't know.  Ben, what is that?  This is one of our buddy's boats.  Now, I went out on this boat for 4th of July.  You've been on the River Rose?  You've been on the River Rose?  Oh.  They have specialty cruises that I have no clue what they are. 
[01:29:00]  And he hadn't started doing this yet.  Did you go on the Periwinkle Cruise?  No, I wasn't on the Periwinkle Cruise.  I went on the 4th of July, about four years ago, I guess.  And we went up the East River, right by the United Nations, right where the fireworks just set off.  And it was really great.  Did some drinking on there.  Watching the fireworks, it was a really good time.  We should get a booze cruise together for this show.  Yeah.  Thinking about the Bill O'Reilly disaster.  How about the cruise right here?  The River Rose?  The one they're talking about. 
[01:29:30]  They have to change it to the River Tulips on your organs.  Well, apparently, you know, one 4th of July cruise a year isn't enough to keep the boat going.  So he has opened up the boat to various specialty cruises.  And I guess one that he's advertising is...  The River Rose is available for alternative lifestyle weddings, engagements, birthdays, or any occasion.  Any occasion.  Basically, no matter where you stick your dick, you can do it on this boat. 
[01:30:00]  Midnight cruises, sunset cruises, Sunday tea dances.  Oh.  Sunday tea dances.  No, no.  And it's spelled T-E-A, but I think it's supposed to be just the letter T.  T.  Everybody does those dances.  We're leaving quickly.  Leaving quickly.  Tea dances.  The Gay Pride Weekend sunset cruise.  Basically, you know, you can watch the sun go down out of the river.  Sunset.  Hey, set your sun on this car. 
[01:30:30]  That's right.  And then he can set his eyes on his friends' families who appear normal, while yours doesn't.  How come there's a mom and dad in that home, and I just have two fellas with bath robes who cough a lot?  Bath robes.  He was so excited about his joke.  I know.  That was a Japanese fact.  That was more just excitement coming out.  He knew he had a good one.  Breath rolls.  Oh, my breath rolls.  Breath rolls.  Yeah, me cough. 
[01:31:00]  Gay Pride Weekend sunset cruise, Friday, June 24th, boarding at 6.45 p.m., returns at 11 o'clock p.m.  And God knows what's going to happen during that cruise.  That's right.  It's going to be sassy.  Going to have to squeegee the deck off when he gets back.  Cruise the skyline.  Oh, this is around here.  I thought this was in Florida.  Cruise the skyline of Manhattan's Statue of Liberty.  That's right.  Just see a, which is actually a tranny, the Statue of Liberty.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Big Dick Daddy.  Wave a big thing in the air. 
[01:31:30]  Aboard the River Rose, sailing from the World's Fair Marina in Queens.  There's free parking there.  Our sunset cruise features guest DJs to the sounds of 70s, 80s, 90s, disco classics.  Yeah.  House music, salsa, merengue, cash bar with bar, special beer, wine, mixed drinks.  Ron B. as Tina Turner.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  That's right.  What a shock.  A female impersonator.  We'll host a show featuring Miss Mess performing a salute to disco. 
[01:32:00]  Be sure to get your tics early.  Yeah.  And the free exclamation point.  Of course.  Which means they're going fast.  $35 in advance on our site.  Put your dick in another man. 
[01:32:30]  Stick it in his can.  In the Navy.  In the Navy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a ball bag on ass tape.  And my ass is black and blue.  They want you.  I'll suck off a Puerto Rican or Jew.  All right.  So be sure to hop on the hip cruise.  $35 in advance or $40 at Dockside. 
[01:33:00]  Oh.  Oh, Dockside.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I heard that wrong.  I love the website.  www.divasgamesanddykes.com  You know what you're getting when you go there.  Divasgamesanddykes.com  Yes.  Woo!  In the Navy.  Catch the HIV.  Yes.  So he's doing gay cruises, obviously. 
[01:33:30]  Yes.  Our friend, who ironically has a gay porno mustache, will be fine.  Yes, he does.  They're going to say, everyone that gets on the boat with Billy is going,  Did I see you in 1978 in a film?  Ah, no.  You're going to be with me.  Somebody else.  I just can't picture him on this cruise.  I neither can.  Does he go or does he just send the boat out by itself?  I bet he goes.  I bet he goes, he probably ties his shirt and a little fucking bow in the front 
[01:34:00]  and wears Speedos and a pair of sneakers with no socks.  Oh, he's a queen.  All right.  Divas, damesanddykes.com  Or you can email divasdamesdykes at aol.com  And it's June 24th of Friday night.  And it should be a nice cruise.  I've actually cruised around in the boats, not this particular one.  No?  But yeah, it's actually cool.  You went on a gay cruise?  I certainly didn't.  Oh, okay.  It was the comedy cruise.  I wonder.  We should get a booze cruise together, though. 
[01:34:30]  Squeegee the deck.  It looks like a bunch of white jellyfish behind the boat.  Jesus.  Just chasing it.  Hey, somebody spilled silicone implants all over the place.  No, no, no.  Hey, everyone wants to talk about gravity.  We're done with the gravity.  And by the way, you don't have to squeegee the deck.  Just ask the guests to lick the floor before they go off the boat.  For to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the fruit roll-up factory, making a fruit roll-up.  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that are so much better than your Americans. 
[01:35:00]  Because I, you know, what do you, let me just, well, you already know, but.  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right.  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad.  You fat American.  Right.  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should, uh, need to know.  Okay.  Back to work. 
[01:35:30]  10-2-8-2.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes.  Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine stopped by the XM Studios, and what a great,  fun time we had that day.  Oh, the music, the laughter.  We played some of the Paul Anka tapes, I remember.  And, uh, Richard Cheese, uh, not a big fan of the Paul Anka.  Feels he's ripping them off.  Hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  The tool.  Shut up.  And, of course, uh, Richard and the band, they, uh, redid one of our classic songs. 
[01:36:00]  Yes.  One of our favorite songs on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mm-hmm.  So why don't you just sit back and listen and see how this all develops.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo más mal de Opie and Anthony en XM2-02.  Good evening.  You guys just want me to start singing?  No good morning, Richard Cheese?  No.  Good morning, Richard.  I'm getting at home with my dick on hard. 
[01:36:30]  So I got the black book for a freak to call.  Picked up the telephone and dialed the seven digits.  Said, yo, this RC baby, are you down with it?  I arrived at her house, knocked on the door.  Not having no idea what the night had in store.  I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny.  Oh, me so horny. 
[01:37:00]  Uh-oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Girls always ask me why I fuck so much.  I say, what's wrong, baby doll?  With a quick nut.  You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted.  But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted.  My dad'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted.  Your mom'll be so mad if she knew I got that ass. 
[01:37:30]  I'm a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Uh-oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Everybody sing along, won't you?  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  No one sing along, for God's sake.  You said it yourself, you like it like I do.  Put your lips on my dick and suck my asshole, too. 
[01:38:00]  I'm a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  My appetite is sex, cause me so horny.  Me so horny.  Me so horny.  Me so horny.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bravo.  Richard Cheese in studio.  What's up, Richard?  Oh, man. 
[01:38:30]  Good to see you, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you so much.  Good to see you.  This is such a nice place.  This is so much better than the dive you used to play in.  Yeah.  We are so glad that there's a dump.  It was.  And thank you for all the pictures of the ladies.  This is lovely.  We got quite a collection started here.  Quite a collection.  It's lovely, beautiful starlets and singers.  Yeah, this is good.  How long have you been in this room?  About a, almost, well, in October it'll be a year.  It's so cute.  They built this room.  Fabulous.  They did, didn't they?  It's your room.  There's a big Opie and Anthony sign. 
[01:39:00]  This whole place is going to be ours out there.  Really?  Doesn't it have a feel and a smell that says the Opie and Anthony show?  It's mostly the smell.  Yeah.  Mostly.  Not so much the feel.  Sorry about that.  Let me just say, speaking of feel, how about these guys, the band?  I brought the kids in.  The whole band.  On the bass, Gordon Brie.  Play a little bass there, Gordon.  And then on the drums, Mr. Frank Fetta, everybody.  And on the piano, the great Bobby Ricotta, everybody.  Pickle in the Ivories.  That's right.  And I'm Richard Cheese.  Thank you so much for having me in.  We didn't even get practice.  We just walked in and started singing. 
[01:39:30]  It was set up, and you guys were playing, and you're singing within three seconds of  actually setting everything up.  That's right.  Very Vegas.  Very live.  Very swinging, late-night show.  Absolutely.  Very exciting.  And Richard, you've got a new album out, huh?  I do.  You know, it's a brand new CD.  It's called Apertif for Destruction.  I love it.  And it's available in stores everywhere.  And at iloverichardcheese.com.  And also at iTunes, which is good, which sort of helps the motherfuckers who like to download  the music illegally.  This gets them a head start. 
[01:40:00]  It's already been formatted into a tradable, burnable format.  So thank you.  Great.  I see you sell thongs.  I love dick.  Yeah, I brought some, actually.  Girl thongs are available.  I was hoping there'd be a bevy of hot female producers on the show.  Yeah, well, look around.  And I'm exactly 100% wrong on what I saw.  Yes, you are.  But these are the hot thongs.  These are great.  We're smart, Richard.  We're smart.  If we knew that there were hot women all around all the time, we would never do a good radio  show.  So we had to sacrifice that part of it.  Well, yeah, that's why they're not here. 
[01:40:30]  The show is really good.  The show is really good.  That's how many women there aren't around here.  Seriously, I've not seen this many dicks since this morning when the band woke up in  bed next to me.  Seriously, get a chick in here.  One girl would be nice.  Can we get a listener to drive down?  One girl.  Well, remember the old days when they were, you know, chicks coming in?  Yeah.  Well, we could get some girls down here to get their I love dick panties.  That'd be good.  You think that'll work?  Sure.  Absolutely.  It's a size two. 
[01:41:00]  So someone medium, you know what I'm saying?  Well, all right.  I haven't seen our listeners.  Yeah, now you're asking for a lot.  You might want to staple two of those together.  Okay, I will.  Hey, can I get a chair for Richard Cheese?  Yeah, why doesn't Richard Cheese have a chair?  Yeah, we're in my damn chair, doesn't he?  We should say hi to Ben Bailey, too, who has entered the festivities.  Ben Bailey finally woke up.  How you doing, man?  I'm doing good.  Came in?  Yeah, I was stuck on a train.  It's the life of a comic, right?  Oh, stuck on a train.  Sure you are. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, of course you were.  I only would have been a half hour late if it hadn't been for that five-minute delay  on the train.  That darn train.  Don't you love when you're late for work or something?  Because I used to do this, too.  You wake up, you're real late, because I would do that all the time.  You drive to work, and you do hit some weird traffic thing that only takes about five minutes  to get through, but it gives you the reality of the excuse, because now you walk in and  go, ah, traffic, I hit it with an accident or something.  And you're not really lying.  You have some motivation for your acting when you're going to the boss. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, you can actually deliver it, make it believable.  Yeah, a little more believable, instead of, I can't believe the traffic today.  Rachel, you've come back.  It was truly awful.  We're lucky I made it at all.  What I can't stand is when you get somewhere, and you had trouble getting there, and by the  time you finally get there, everybody there is an expert on why you had a problem getting  there.  All right, you're like, oh, I was stuck on the train.  Oh, you can't take the train at this hour.  You fool.  You should have gotten a cab. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, well.  Where were you when I needed you?  You know what?  I did take the train.  It only took me three minutes, asshole.  Yeah, I'm lying, idiot.  I overslept.  I'm lying.  I'm a liar.  You're stupid.  Let's say hi to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Tell him, Fred.  Hey, I was watching that Dawn of the Dead, and out of nowhere came that Richard Chee song,  and the Sickness.  That's right.  Yeah, we did Down with the Sickness.  Give me a little Down with the Sickness, boys.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, this is a great story.  The director of the movie, Dawn of the Dead, he was listening to the CD on the set, and 
[01:43:00]  one thing led to another, and they said, let's put that song in the movie.  And they paid us.  They actually paid us a couple grand or something like that.  Really?  And for every DVD that sells, we get, I think it's nothing.  We get nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  So that's pretty good.  But it was great exposure.  We got some good fans, including Fred, who, by the way, also a dude.  I don't know if you're keeping track at home.  Oh, if you go with phone calls, too?  Yeah, we get it.  It's all actives or guys.  This is a big, yeah, male dick fest. 
[01:43:30]  Well, let me tell you, it's one big sausage party.  Let's have a dick fest right now with a little Richard Cheese, a little dick, if you know  what I'm saying.  Thank you.  That's me.  I'm complaining and learned to love the cock, Richard.  Thank you.  I might.  As you paged through the Playboy that was right in front of my microphone, now it's over  there.  You show up late.  I'm not sure what happened.  Fucking stolen pornography.  My band is playing a little song by Disturb, ladies and gentlemen.  Do you feel that?  Oh, shit. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, wah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, wah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, wah, ah, ah, ah.  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness  Open up your hate and let it flow into me  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness  You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness 
[01:44:30]  You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the dickness  Open up your hate and let it flow into me  I can see inside you the sickness is rising  It seems that all that was good has died  Oh no, the Bowery Ballroom, which we're playing at on Saturday night, is a scary place  Now that you've woken up the demon in me 
[01:45:00]  Alright boys, will you give it to me?  One, two, three, four  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness  You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness  You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness  Open up your hate and let it flow into me  Why can't you just fuck off and die?  Get down with the sickness  Fuck you, I don't need this shit, I'm down with the sickness 
[01:45:30]  You stupid, sadistic, abusive fucking whore  Get down with the sickness  Here it comes  Get ready to die  Get ready to  Die  Thank you  Richard Cheese, everyone  Thank you  Uncensored for the first time anywhere on broadcast radio  Fantastic  I love richardcheese.com for more information  We should get him downstairs at the Steinway joint again 
[01:46:00]  Imagine that  The Steinway headquarters, Bobby, my piano player, the Steinway headquarters are right next door  Right downstairs  If you go down when you came in the lobby  It's to the right  So we can go down there and maybe jam, play a couple of things  Well, the old ivory  John Valby might have wrecked that for everybody  Yeah  You know who John Valby is, right?  Mm-mm  You really don't?  I've heard the name, I don't remember who he is  We call him Dr. Dirty  Dr. Dirty  Oh, yeah, okay, I know who this guy is  He's an amazing pianist  Yeah  That just happens to sing really dirty songs  The C word, everything, okay?  He says cunt  Yeah 
[01:46:30]  Wait a minute, you say C word when you're on XM?  How do you?  Yeah, we leave that to other people on the show  Oh, that's nice  It's like an old habit, we're used to doing broadcast radio  So we still do the initial thing from time to time  So Valby was up here, he didn't have a keyboard  So we told him to go downstairs  And we asked politely if we could use one of their awesome Steinway pianos  Like, what do they cost?  Like, a hundred grand or something crazy like that?  Yeah, easily  So he started playing just beautifully  And then finally kicked into one of his songs  And just horrified everyone down there  That had their suits on and stuff 
[01:47:00]  Did you bring a microphone down there?  Oh yeah, well we brought a cell phone  Oh, the old days, it was a cell phone  Such good sound quality we got out of the piano  It was hilarious  A hundred thousand dollars Steinway through a cell phone  Sounds just the way they meant it to be heard  If it's a mobile, a T-Mobile  The quality for the Steinway is really good  Is it?  It's got a Steinway setting on it, I believe  That's right  It's got real Steinway tones  Speaking of which, we have fucking ringtones  Everyone's got ringtones  We got Richard Cheese ringtones  If you go to iloverichardcheese.com 
[01:47:30]  You can download them, I swear to God  See, that's a pretty cool ringtone to have, though  Yeah  Like, some of the people with ringtones  Are like, why does Newt Gingrich have a ringtone?  Like, what?  Some people, you just  Music makes a good ringtone  Can I just say something?  It's good to have you guys back  Am I right?  Thank you, Richard  Because they're funny, am I right, fellas?  Are they funny or what?  Yeah, the band concurs  I like that  It's so true  You guys, I missed you  Now, you're back on the air  It is just a thrill and an honor  And I hope they're paying you  And I hope there's actually people 
[01:48:00]  Who get the service  Well, they  Yeah  They certainly are  How many listeners have you got on this show?  Any idea?  At least  How many people are on XM these days?  Well, I think listening to our show  I think we're up to about 180  That's pretty good  That's about right  180  XM has well over 4 million  I was just at XM's headquarters  In Washington, D.C.  The other day  You were down there?  I was down there  I saw the big sign  It says 4 billion served  I'm at 4 million served up on top  Yep  And it's a nice facility 
[01:48:30]  When we signed with these guys  A little less than a year ago  It was like 2.1, 2.2  Really?  It's pretty good  It's growing that fast  I'll go out on a limb  And say they've almost doubled it  I don't know how you do the math  So fast like that  But thank you  Slow down  It's early in the morning  I like to show off like that  Every so often  It was pretty good  Richard, the next time you come by  You see all those cubicles  They're going to be gone out there  There's a bunch of sales weasels  Out there right now  They're all leaving  And we're going to have  A nice performance area  No kidding  And we're going to have  A poll for the ladies  To do their thing  We're going to build a stage 
[01:49:00]  A poll  So when the ladies strippers  Come in  And they bitch about  Having to take their clothes off  Like they do now  We could actually put them  In the work environment  That they're used to  Where they feel  They could take their clothes off  And do the poll act  Can you get at home  If Norton's here anyway?  Well, I think Norton  Scares him sometimes  Talking about clear stuff  I love Jim Norton  I met Jim Norton  For the first time on this show  And now I see him all over  He's fabulous  He's blowing up  He's in Texas  Well, we're here all morning  For you guys  We'll play as many songs  As you want  And do not plug my CD anymore 
[01:49:30]  Oh, no?  Because you've already done it once  And that's all I need  I just want you to know  I'm here for the love  And for you guys  Not to plug  Where can people get the CD  That we're not plugging?  No, I really don't want to talk about it  I'm not even going to do it  You're not going to tell people  Where they can get it  Absolutely not  Where's the website  That you don't want to give out?

How about we do a little  Nine Inch Nails for the kids?  Oh, nice  Start it up for us there, buddy  I mean, Frank  Is this going to be just like  Old drummer name  I get confused  I know what song it is  Is this going to be just like  Johnny Cash's version of Hurt? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, man  How great was that record?  Start it up for us, boys  That was a wonderful song  When he did Hurt  On the American Reportings  Yeah, this is almost as good  It's Johnny Cash  Little Nine Inch Nails  With a Taste of Sesame Street  Built right there  Oh, yeah  Here we go  Love this tune  Thank you, fellas  Can you hear the bass okay? 
[01:51:00]  Oh, yeah  Tell me  The only thing that  Works for me  Help me get away from myself  I wanna fuck you like an animal  I wanna feel you from the inside

[01:53:00]  And it's sold out though  But you guys are welcome  In fact, everyone on the staff who's a girl  And Opie and Anthony can go  Wow, that's rough  Sorry guys, but seriously  Sex change operation, anything  Please, just a woman  Any woman  But I know that  I don't know how long you want us on the air  But I do have a topic that I'd love to talk about  Yes  At some point  That involves me swearing a lot  Oh yeah  Because I'm very angry about something  And this is the only radio show  Well, vent  Go for it  That's what it's about  This is the platform that I've been waiting for  But I need to take some water  Can I get some hot water for tea?  Hot water for tea? 
[01:53:30]  Wow  My throat hurts  The hell happens  It used to be all about the booze  Well, you know  I'm hot  It's a little early  By the way, congratulations to Boston  What happened over there?  New York may be America's most intoxicating city  But when it comes to pot  Boston and Boulder are on a higher level  All the college towns  They said that all the college towns  Which is a big surprise  Yeah  This is pretty sick, actually  According to a new government study  12.1% of folks in Boston 
[01:54:00]  And 10.3% in Boulder  Report smoking marijuana in the past month  12%?  That's what they're saying  Wow  That is a lot of people  12.1% of Bostonians  That seems really low  Low?  Low?  I'm thinking high  You've got to think of like  I'm thinking high  But that includes  Doesn't that number include like  Children?  Like infants?  And the elderly?  Yeah, I mean  Slow down there  That's everybody  I'm sure if you said 
[01:54:30]  Of college age  It would be  Higher  Than 12%  80 or 90  It's more or less  One out of eight  In Boston  Smoking the dope  In the past month  One out of eight  Remember Smoke Two Joints?  Or math  Give me a little rhythm  And give me a C  One out of eight  I guess that's a lot  Yeah, that's a lot  You've got to figure  Some people didn't admit it  That's true too  Uh oh  We've got a song  Yeah  You're painting to your  Fabulous news guy  Great  Oh, alright  Gordon on the bass 
[01:55:00]  It's Lawson  Smoke Two Joints in the morning  And I smoke Two Joints at night  Thank you, okay  That's all we know  It was very timely though  What we make up for  With the quantity  I've heard that song  Yeah, we used to do that live  But you know  The potheads in the band left  So that we don't have  The legal right to do it anymore  Yeah, is this a new band?  It's a brand new band  We've got a new bass player  A new drummer  And the new piano player  And oddly enough  The original piano player  Is in town today 
[01:55:30]  In New York  Really?  Out of Chicago  And the other piano player  Who fucking sucked  Oh, wow  Is also in town  Doing a very plum gig  This morning  With the Hilary Duff band  Was on TV?  Yeah  This morning  I think it was on  Whatever that  Good Morning America  Today Show had him on  Today Show  Is there a little  Friction  There's always tension  In the Richard Cheese organization  Are you tough?  Are you like a tough  I'm a pussycat  Do I pay you guys well or what?  Because I'm thinking  I'm thinking we got another 
[01:56:00]  Paul Anka over here  I've heard the Paul Anka  Behind the scenes tapes  And maybe you're like that  Did you really?  Are there Paul Anka tapes?  You haven't heard the Paul Anka  Oh my god  You don't hear this fucking scumbag  Going to go to town  He just put out a new CD  That is in direct competition  With the Richard Cheese Empire  Absolutely  And that's one of the things  I was angry about  I was going to ask you about this  Because you've been doing this  A very long time  And now you've got these guys  That can't sell records anymore  And decided this is a way to go  And they found a niche  For themselves out of nowhere 
[01:56:30]  I just  So it's like Paul Anka  Old school guy  Doing exactly what you're doing  Richard  He just put out his new CD  Which is called  Rock Swings  Not as clever as  Lounge Against the Machine  No  And it's got  Smells Like Teen Spirit on it  Which we do in our act  It's got  What's the other song on there?  Do you have that Paul Anka CD up there?  Yeah  Dedicated song  The problem is  There's no humor involved  In the Paul Anka stuff  And there's a couple songs  On there  Yeah he shouldn't be doing it  Do a Paul Anka song  You should do a version  Of one of his old songs  Having My Baby  Having My Baby 
[01:57:00]  Or you should fuck him  Like an animal  Having My Baby  Thank you  But I just found out  He sold  Now don't play his fucking CD  While I'm here  Just read the titles  I was going to play it  To show you how bad it was  Oh I heard it  It's horrible  I mean it's great  I want to hear his outtake  If you like shitty  Alright no  We'll play his outtake  You haven't heard Paul Anka  Yelling at his band  Oh I'd love to hear that  Because that's what I need  That's the ammo I need  To turn the country away from  Because we sold  A thousand of our CDs last week  He sold 8,000  In his first week out  Son of a bitch  I know  And he took  Well they got these old 
[01:57:30]  Paul Anka fans  That think they're going to  Get something that they  Richard you sound so angry  I'm bitter  You know what I am  I'm bitter  I'm going to record  My own backstage tapes  But I don't yell at the band  I yell at someone else's band  What happened with  The keyboard player  I'll tell you that story  It's a good one  Oh here's a Paul Anka CD  Hold on a second  He did Eyes Without a Face  By Billy Idol  Which is what we were  Working on for the next album  He did Love Cats  Which we do  And Black Hole Sun  He stole that  Steven Eadie did that  Five years ago  Steven Eadie did Black Hole Sun  That's right  I forgot about that 
[01:58:00]  Fuck you Paul Anka  Yeah  Hold on  He does Wonderwall  By Oasis  You know any of those Bobby  Yeah  Screw him  Screw Bobby  Yeah  No I'm just kidding  I love you Bobby  But now what happened  You had a falling out  Because I noticed  It's a whole new band  The first keyboard player  He left because he was married  And his wife was in Chicago  Or something  And he was too far away  So he moved home  So we let him out  So I got this new guy  We auditioned this new guy  His name was  I don't want to say his name  But it rhymes with Gorin  Okay  And he showed up in the band 
[01:58:30]  And he was slick  And he was cool  And he did a couple shows with us  And then one day  You know we've got like  Ten shows booked in August  And in July  He calls me and goes  Hey man  Gordon do your impression  Of his voice  Yeah because we're all  Going to know  Yeah it's phenomenal  He goes  Hey man listen  I got a gig with  Hilary Duff's band  I got to go  I got to  I'm going to be his touring  You know the touring musician  I got to  I can't turn it down man  I'm like  Okay well  You know I got 12 gigs booked 
[01:59:00]  What are you  What am I supposed to do  So he just left  And he also  Got paid for his last gigs  And I didn't have to pay him  And I paid him all his gigs  Why did you pay him?  I thought he was going to  Reimburse me for the airfare  For the gigs that we had booked  He didn't do a damn thing  Look at the tension going on  I'm telling you  In the lounge against the machine  But luckily  Sorry Bobby  As soon as he did  We got this new guy Bobby  Yeah  Whose name also Bobby Ricotta  Total coincidence  And he's really good 
[01:59:30]  And he's on time  And he hasn't bailed on me  For any tours  Is that correct?  Still in the band  Really good  And also  He looks black  Which helps  Well  Well  I think it's more  I'll go Hawaiian  Yeah  Well he is  But if you look in the CD  He totally looks like a brother  And he's like  Giving us so much cred  Cred  Some street cred  Some street cred  So thank you Bobby  For staying in the band  Oh there's a CD  That's pretty good  Something tells me though  You wield an iron dick  With the band  No I'm not that bad  I'm not that bad 
[02:00:00]  I mean  The other bass  The first bass player  He might have  Done something with a girl  In a hotel room in Vegas  Oh well  That might have not been  To her liking  Ah  Jesus  Alright  Some bad room service  I would assume  No no  It was  I don't want to talk about it  Because I think I'm not allowed to  But he had to go  He had to go  He had to go  It was him or the band  Going to jail  You know  And those allegations  Rear their ugly heads  Sometimes you just got to 
[02:00:30]  Cut your ties  Or the band  Going to jail  That's what you want to hear  The band and the whole  Richard Cheese thing  Going into the  Wow  That would be  Actually it would probably be good  You could put out  A prison album  Like Johnny Cash  Lounge against the machine  We really would like to play  In a prison  If there was  Someone over at  Rikers  Could just book us  There you go  That would be a pleasant gig  I got fucked  Up the ass  Last night  I read an article  Those guys in Rikers  And God bless them  I'm sure that they're all 
[02:01:00]  On drug busts  Which are totally stupid  They use their own feces  As a weapon  Right  I have heard this  That is a sweet  How do they do it though?  They put it in their mouth  And spit it at the guards  Nice  I'm so serious  Why would you have to  Put it in your mouth?  Couldn't you just throw it at the guards?  Well I think they want the propulsion  And the surprise factor  A lot of surprise  And it's coming out of his mouth  Yeah  Yeah you might  If the guy raises his hand  And wind up  You might be able to  Duck out of your way  But if you're just looking  At some guy in the face 
[02:01:30]  And going hey  Hey boy  Of course it's like 1920s  On a chain gang  What am I doing?  Hey boy  What you doing in there boy?  What we have here  That's right  Is a mouth full of feces  And he just spits it out at you  Now you got trouble right?  That's dedication  How is that a weapon?  That is dedication  To the act right there  Remember that great song  By Pat Benatar  Give me an B  Oh a B  Stop using shit as a weapon  Thank you 
[02:02:00]  I'll be here all week  Paul Anka's going to record that tomorrow  Fucking Paul Anka  Comes out with a CD  The week after mine  He sells eight times as many CDs  And he's online  Fuck Paul Anka  I'm calling Letterman's show  Every week for six months  Hey you gotta have us on  We're funny  Dave will like us  The whole Letterman band loves us  Will Lee  Yeah  Plays on our fucking CD  Really?  He played bass on American Idiot  So I call up the booker  And I'm like  Hey we do lounge versions  Of contemporary rock songs  And they go  Oh yeah Paul Anka's on  This Wednesday doing that  Son of a bitch 
[02:02:30]  How about going to Jay Leno?  Paul Anka  Ah Jay Leno  Very very funny man  Uh oh  Oh wait  No I won't do that show  Uh oh  Oh boy  Now that's Jimmy's favorite  It's loyalty  Jimmy was just on Jay Leno  Jimmy Norton  Jimmy Norton  Yeah  He was just on like two days ago  On Monday actually  Was that his first time on there  Or second time?  Second time  And then he sat down with Jay  And had a great long conversation  Cracking the audience up  And making pedophile remarks  About Hilary Duff  Who was sitting next to him  Hilary Duff coming up a lot today  Look Hilary Duff 
[02:03:00]  What is with Hilary Duff?  She's on the Regis  And what the hell is that girl's name?  Jenilee Harrison  Jenilee Harrison  I don't know which one of the Janits  Or Chrissies that she is  I don't know  Which twin were you in that TV show?  That is an excellent Regis  I love it  That's a very good Regis  Well it is  You gotta just plug your nose  And yell at everything  I do an impression of Edward G. Robinson  I'd like to do for everybody right now  It's from the movie Key Largo  Can I have a drum roll there Frank?  Alright let's hear this  Edward G. Robinson addressing 
[02:03:30]  Humphrey Bogart's character  Who formerly served in the military  Edward G. Robinson about to be shot  But he knows  So he's trying to cut a deal  With the character  And here he goes  Soldier  Soldier  Soldier  Thank you  I'll be here all week  Edward G. Robinson  I felt like I was there  Wow  I had my eyes closed  And it was just like it  It sounded like Richard Cheese  Doing a bad Edward G. Robinson  Why isn't Hilary Duff on our show?  She's doing the press junket  In New York 
[02:04:00]  She looks good  She sure does  She's lost all her weight  Hey let's go to the phones Anthony  Because we were talking about shit  And Jeremy has something here  Jeremy in Jersey  Go ahead  Love this show  God the piano playing in the background  Just mellows us all out  I love it  Keep it going  Keep it going  Nice  Go ahead Jeremy  Some shit music Bobby  Listen you gotta give him recording  And that shit dick song  So he can cover that  Next time he comes in  The shit dick song?  Have you heard the shit dick song?  No I'd love to hear that song  Yes  We have the shit dick song  We haven't played this one  In a very long time  Is it about ass?  You think you guys 
[02:04:30]  Could work up a version of this?  If in a few minutes  Sure  Our faithful listeners  Would just love you  We got time this morning  Love you  Can we get some headphones  For my good friends  Bobby, Frank and Gordon  Wow that would be  Are you insane  That would be lovely  Are you kidding me?  It's a work in progress  Still a radio station  This is  I had trouble getting my own headphones  That's how they are around here  You got pop screens  Oh wait  These guys want to hear the songs  Well they're going to need to hear it  At some point  No we can do it  We can play it 
[02:05:00]  We'll turn off all the mics  And then it'll be on the studio  In the studio  Okay that's good  And then maybe you guys  Leave the studio  And try to work up a quick version  Bobby's so good  He could probably write it up  In a nice spot  Here's shit dick  You want to explain shit dick Anthony  It's from  Well there's  Panzerfaust Records  Panzerfaust Records  They have disbanded  Yeah  Because there were partners  That ran  Panzerfaust Records  And one of the partners  Found out that the other partner's mother  Was Hispanic  Uh huh  And since Panzerfaust  Is a white supremacist label 
[02:05:30]  Right  Uh this kind of shook up  The corporate world over there  At Panzerfaust  A little bit  Which is really funny  When you think the guy  Probably was so nervous  Keeping this secret for so long  Yeah  Uh Panzerfaust  Eric we're going to need someone  To get the lyrics  For these guys  Immediately  So that'd be great  They got to transcribe  They only handled  White supremacy  Uh  Racist  Homophobic  Uh  Bands  That would sing these songs  And uh  This song  Shit Dick  Is about the homosexual community  And some of the um 
[02:06:00]  Some of the celebrities  Uh  That are homosexual  And how this guy feels about them  I'm looking for new material  For our new Greatest Six record  And this is something  I don't think Paul Anka  Is going to cover  And this could be one of those  B-side things  That some of these artists do  That really takes off  One of those obscure songs  That you just happen to have  Let me tell you about  The hidden track  That's not listed  I'm very angry about Paul Anka  Don't say it  Don't say it anymore  Because it totally angers me  You just said it  Oh fuck  The P word  The P word  It is the P word  We have audio  Of Paul Anka losing his mind  We'll play for it  I can't wait  Because I can put that on my website 
[02:06:30]  And say don't support  Yeah listen to this guy  This raving lunatic  We'll give you a copy  He yells at his band  Like they're animals  There's a Great Buddy Rich  Recording  Yeah  The Great Buddy Rich  Doing that on a bus  And I love that track  Because he uh  He says  You fucking guys  I could  I could play better  Shit out of my ass  And you hear a bus engine  Through the whole tape  It's so good  You hear that  It's so good  Alright here we go 
[02:07:00]  For Richard Keys  And the band  This is one of our faves  You can pick it up  We're always trying to find  Ways to play this  We always try to find  An excuse to play  This lovely little ditty  We hate all shit 
[02:07:30]  Andy Warhol  Mick Jagger  Michael Jackson  Shit dick  Shit dick  Jeffrey Dahmer  Cannon  Shit dick  Shit dick  We ain't shit  Dick  But slamming shit  Dick  Boys 
[02:08:00]  George  Shit dick  Freddie Mercury  Shit dick  David Bowie  Shit dick  Rob  Albert  Judas  Free  Chicken  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Robert Engel 
[02:08:30]  Freddy Krueger  Bitch  Fuck  You  Shit dick  Truman Capote  Richard Simmons  Ron Stewart  Richard Gere  Hunter Blaine  We ain't the fuck you 
[02:09:00]  You're six  Goddamn, I love that song  That is so good  We love that thing, we haven't played that in a long time  That's really good, yeah, we can work up a little  You can work up a version of that, Richard?  You know, loungeify it, give it a little more swing class  Richard Gere, butt gerbilin' shit dick  We're not doing it now  I don't have the lyrics yet, but let's tease the quarter hour 
[02:09:30]  The lyrics are star studded  What we'll do is we'll take a break in a little while  The band, you know, leave the studio  You work it up a little bit  Maybe hear the song again in Steve's studio  And then we'll come back and do that  Yeah, we'll totally do that, that's good  Hey, uh, Hawk, where are you getting those lyrics?  Just type them up  You just typed those up?  On the fly  From memory?  I think you missed a couple, but he did a very good job  That's very cool  I'd like to volunteer to do the fart noises  Yeah, that'd be awesome  There you go  But we need you to do them not just like the original song  You need to sort of lounge your fart noises out  And by the way, as a song guy 
[02:10:00]  I think, and by the way, what a great title for myself  Song guy  That is a really well constructed  Isn't that good?  Song, because they didn't just repeat shit dick over and over again  And throw names in there  They built a real song  They had a verse, and then there was a bridge  And there was a turnaround, and there was a refrain  And then they did that double time with the call and answer  Right, right  That's a great song  What's the name of the artist?  Who did that?  We just know they were on Panzerfaust records 
[02:10:30]  I'd love to find out  A little racial problem  Every time we sing a song, you know, we play a royal record company  Yeah  Panzerfaust was an anti-tank weapon that the Nazis used to use back in the day  And by the day, I mean the 40s  Back in the day  Back in the day  Back in the good old days  When we was hanging in Poland and shit  Back in the day, gee  We was glitzkrieging all over the Europe  Yo, B  Yeah  I don't ever laugh when I do these radio shows 
[02:11:00]  Because all the rest of the DJs in the United States suck  And you guys are funny  And I love that guy  Richard, thank you so much  Thank you so much  You don't even know, because I'm on 100 radio stations all the time  I can only imagine  We were just on Z100  And those guys are sweet  I know these people for a long time  But it's regular radio, too  It's regular radio  They're not hilarious like this  It's so very nice  We hope we can ruin it for regular radio  Yeah, I hope so  Did they play shit dick?  Oddly enough, they did  But it was Shakira's version  Let me tell you, though 
[02:11:30]  That is sexy  It's sexy because, you know, music is an entity unto itself  I'm phoning Shakira out of the USA today  Remind me, speaking of Panzerfaust  I also have a Nazi record label story about my old label that I want to tell you guys later  Really?  You think I hate Paul Anka  Well, we got Paul Anka clips for you  Oh, I can't wait  I've got to tell you about my old record label, Oleo Records  Let me get that spelling right  Oleo?  The slander and libel suit  Why have I heard of Oleo Records?  Who else was on there? 
[02:12:00]  They put out a lot of independent stuff  They put out the Richard Blaine  Was Jackie Martling?  Yeah, Jackie Martling was on Oleo Records  I remember him always hawking his wares  Let me tell you a little story about that label  Do we have time now?  Sure  What time is it in real time, by the way?  It is five minutes  Now, if we say the time during the replays  It is about six minutes to the hour  To the hour  To the hour  And there's no Arbitron, is there?  And there's no commercials  We stop when we want to stop  There's no nothing  There's no ratings 
[02:12:30]  There's no accountability  There's no nothing  There's just XM's money  I was just thinking  We've got to get into that five minute till break  No, we can get in the news  At the top of the hour  And do the legal ID  Hatred of shit, dude  Oh, man, I love this  Wow  Hatred of shit, dude  Well, the old record label  When I first did this Richard Cheese album  This first label  Bought my first CD for $7,000 
[02:13:00]  Seven cheese?  Seven grand to record the entire album  Seven large  16 songs for seven grand  $500 or less per song  Now, at the time, were you psyched?  Thinking, hey, I'm making money with my music  I'm thinking I'm going to be on a record deal  I'm going to have CDs in every store  I'm thinking this is going to be huge  Right  And I did the whole album with just a couple guys and musicians  And it worked out great  He put the thing out  This is day to boo, by the way  Yeah, I know  I was about to  Go ahead  We have a little story, too  No, no, no  You go  You first  And then we'll tell the exact same story  Oh, good 
[02:13:30]  Well, it gets so much worse than I think any other horror story I've heard in the music industry  So, he put out the CD and it sold maybe, you know, 5,000 copies  And he just stopped doing anything about it  I go out there and I start working it  I come into New York  I go on the O.B. and Anthony show when it was on FM  Those were the days  And then we sold CDs  And we were promoting and it was great  And then he calls me up and says  Hey, we'll do a second record  We'll do your second record for the option  Now, my contract said the option was 15,000 for the next record  All right  It was great 
[02:14:00]  15,000, I'm making double as much  I can do it twice as good an album  And he goes  No, but I'm only going to give you 7,000 for the second record  I said, but the contract says 15,000  Did he pull the legal term contract schmontrack?  He did  Which it was so much better than that  It's hard to get out of  He said, I know  And my lawyer said to him, argument?  And he said, argument schmargument  That's what happened  God, I hate that legal jargon  I know  So he said, no  Because I'm rich  I'm only going to pay you $7,000 
[02:14:30]  Take it or leave it  And I said, but the contract says you have to pay me $15,000  If you exercise the second option  I said, you know  He said, well then I won't exercise the second option  And he walked away  Release me from the contract  I'm like, okay, fine  You asshole  Then I'll go put out my own CDs  So I put out Toxicity  My own CD  And it went well, thank you  I said to him, look  I'm going to put out my own CDs  Are you cool with that?  And he said, sure  He said, I'll write you a letter  That says you're free and clear  Uh-oh  He writes me a letter  You can use Richard Cheese 
[02:15:00]  You can say the name  You can run the whole CD  And do what you want without obligation  So I put out Toxicity  Great  I put out I'd Like a Virgin  I'm holding this up for the radio audience  I see that  I have two CDs out there independent  And I'm thinking to myself  You know what?  RichardCheese.com is his website right now  I should own that  Absolutely should  Who should have OpieAndAnthony.com?  Well, we had a fight for our website  Yes, we did  You did?  It took a good year  And you won, right?  Yeah  Because you can't fucking not be  OpieAndAnthony and own it  An anti-fan had the site 
[02:15:30]  I'm kind of getting some thing here  Because I see your website as  I love RichardCheese.com  Exactly  And not just RichardCheese.com  And you can't imagine how much I enjoy  Saying those extra two syllables  A hundred times a day  And people coming up to me going  Hey, can I go to your website?  RichardCheese.com  I go, no, don't go to RichardCheese.com  Because he set up his website  By the way, I love Bobby  Playing beautiful, lovely music  Behind my horrible legal nightmare  He has RichardCheese.com  Just selling the first CD  And no information about my other CDs 
[02:16:00]  Now you don't get it  So like you're sober squatting  You're back  Do you get any money?  I barely get any money from that CD  Yeah  And so anyway  I've been fighting him  To get RichardCheese.com back  And I said, look man  I'm Richard Cheese  Right  You told me it was okay  For me to put out Richard Cheese CDs  I have a trademark on Richard Cheese now  Maybe you should shorten your name to Dick  Well, I got DickCheese.com  Oh, you got DickCheese.com  DickCheese.com  I called this porn guy in Florida  Who owned DickCheese.com  And I said, hey man, look  You're not using it  It just forwards to CyberFoxes.com 
[02:16:30]  If you pull up CyberFoxes.com  Pull up DickCheese.com on there  And look what comes up  Opie, read that  If you see it  DickCheese.com  I love this guy  He was so nice  I don't have BenBailey.com  I had to use the real BenBailey.com  See?  Really?  Well, Ben Bailey could be another guy  It's a British  Some guy in England  This is so great  This is hilarious  You go to DickCheese.com  It says, welcome to DickCheese.com  If you're looking for lounge singer Richard Cheese  Click here  If you're looking for top-notch explicit internet porn  Click here 
[02:17:00]  I split this DickCheese.com  With this porn guy  He was so nice  That's hilarious  That is pretty cool  Because now two people are sharing the same link page  That's right  And he gets my traffic  And I get his  Isn't that great  How you're working together  Exactly  And that's a really  We play We Are the World for this  Hold on  This is a tough decision though, Richard  It's like  Do I go to the lounge singer Richard Cheese  Or get top-notch explicit porn  I don't know which one to do  I guarantee you  Everyone does the porn first  They go right to the porn page  Absolutely  And they get their rocks off 
[02:17:30]  And then they're like  Alright, what was I doing again?  Oh yeah, Richard Cheese  I'm looking for Richard Cheese  But I've got a couple extra minutes  I've got to click on this  Richard, our story really fast  We put out a CD called Demented World  Uh-huh  Sold well over 100,000 copies  Oh my god, that's great  We maybe saw 10 grand each  Maybe  We got so roped on this  I don't even think we saw that much  Right now  No, no  And then the guy decided to stop  Well, go ahead  He decided to stop paying us at all  Wow  All of a sudden  All these CDs are out there  He just stopped paying us 
[02:18:00]  And know why he decided to stop paying us?  Because we were bitching on the air  For a year  That we weren't getting paid  We weren't getting paid  So we started bitching about on the air  He finally calls us up and goes  Uh, I heard you bitching about me on the air  Said, yeah, well we haven't been paid  He goes, well you know what?  Now you're not getting paid  But  Oh my gosh  He stopped  So you're not going to pay us?  Even though you haven't been paying us  Now you're really not going to pay us  These shysters  Please tell me you've sued him  No  No  Why not?  You can get a lot more dough out of that  I'll sue him for you 
[02:18:30]  You know what I say?  Sue Shmoo  I  I went to high school with her, by the way  Huge fit  Some Asian girl  She was beautiful  And quite a slut  We knew that we were in trouble with this guy, Richard  Sue Shmoo  He was representing Bozo the Clown  Right  But not the original Bozo  That's a big contract  Not the original Bozo the Clown  And then he actually told  Because he had the real website  He was trying to be our agent as well  So he was bragging with these stories of people he knows  And things he's done in his past 
[02:19:00]  He actually told us a story  You know the song  Na na na na  Hey hey  Do you know who sings that?  I do  Very obscure band  It's got an S in it  Yeah  One hit wonder  Water vapor  Sweet or sweet or  Steam  Steam  No no  Steam that's right  It is Steam  He claims that he  Wait I think I got  It's Steam  Oh very good  Very good  Is it A  Steam  This guy who wanted to be our agent  What is  Steam  Was telling us that he was in the studio while this band was doing this song but they didn't have a name 
[02:19:30]  Uh huh  And he saw  He saw Steam  And it was this long stupid manager agent type story where they go into these long winded things  It takes forever  So I saw Steam coming out of the radiator and I said why not call the band Steam  And they went what a great idea and as we know the name of the  Shut up  I was with a manager one time and he's telling us this long story about how this other manager he was with 
[02:20:00]  They were fighting over clients all the time and this one manager turned down this one client and he signed her to a contract on a napkin  A cocktail napkin in a bar and they signed the contract and do you know who that artist was  And now we have to  Now it's a game  We gotta say  Um  Uh  Heart  No  Was it  Uh  Pat Benatar  No  Yeah  Panzerfaust  Shit dick  No  And you're just sitting there going could you just say this so I could go home 
[02:20:30]  Oh that's awesome  That artist was Cindy Lauper  Oh my god  Wow  Wow  That's fantastic  How about that  I love that  I heard Scott Shannon this morning on the PLJ doing a story about which  Which starlet has herpes  And they were doing the mystery question  The answer is D  All of the above  Yes  That's an interesting  Although I was just like wow  Shannon is  Get the post  That's the blind item in the post today  They had a couple  Blind item  Exactly  They had a good  A couple good ones today  And then the same guy was trying to get us to sign a five year contract in the middle of a food court in a mall 
[02:21:00]  With a big  Because he wants another story for next time  With a big  And I was in a food court  And I signed it on a root beer  And that was Opie and Anthony  He brought  And remember he brought his muscle with him  That big scary black dude  Brought a big black guy with him  It was almost like you will sign his contract  Anyone could sit in an expensive office  I use food courts and pass the savings on to you  How many people can claim a deal in front of the Shinnebun?  Yeah  By the way  Try the chicken chow mein here 
[02:21:30]  It's wonderful  To finish the story  Only the free sample  Yes sir  Just to finish the story  The reason we were in the food court  When your food has toothpicks stuck through it  You know you're dining inside  Look hors d'oeuvres  To finish the food court story  We put out this Dementor World CD Richard  And we toured  We kind of toured the CD  We went to  Signings everywhere  All over Massachusetts  We were  We went on that mall tour  Right  We went to all these malls and record stores  And no joke  There was a few  We were there all day  Six, seven hour signings 
[02:22:00]  Unbelievable  And we're just thinking  Ka-ching, ka-ching in our heads  Because we weren't making any money  And this is like  We're finally going to make some cash  For what  You know  With what we do  So he wasn't paying us  And we finally meet in the mall  At the food court  And now he's going to give us  He's going to give us our checks  So now we're like  On the way there  Me and Oprah going  This is great  Finally we're going to get money  This motherfucker better have  Ten grand  At least ten grand each for us  And that would only be  Maybe you know  Part of the money  Part of the money  And it's like  At least  In good faith  It better be a check  For ten grand each  Uh huh 
[02:22:30]  This guy was like  Selling t-shirts and posters  And counting the cash  In the back corner  Oh man  Oh it was all cash  He'd sell these posters and t-shirts  We didn't see one guy  And you just see his arm  Moving in here  And you know  He's not jerking off  He's out  Just wads of cash  And we never  Looked up every once in a while  Keep it up boys  Keep it up  Keep going boys  Keep going guys  Good work  Thumbs up  His big green stained thumb  Thumbs up  You son of a bitch  Because we were just  Pictures of like  Friggin Benjamin Franklin  On his thumb 
[02:23:00]  From counting hundreds  We were just happy  To be there  Because you know  I mean this is huge exposure  The CD kind of went  All over the country  Not you know  But I mean  But a few here  A few there  All over the country  It was exciting  You know  So he had nothing  He didn't have a check  For anything  Oh he had a check  I think it was for a grand each  A grand each  One thousand dollars each  He slides it in the envelope  Like a big money deal  Is going down  Like a ransom  For a hostage  Thing is slide  A suitcase of cash  And a thousand bucks  He slides up  And we are like  This son of a bitch 
[02:23:30]  And he wanted to sign us  At that moment  You know  Hey guys  Here's the contract  It's a five year deal  Like  Dude  You just stiffed us  And we're going to now  Sign with you  Which item  Five year deal  You guys get a thousand dollars  Every six months  Yeah  Yeah  Every six months  I know  I was ready to take my  Dry veggie burger  Yeah  Who knows what it was  I went to high school  With her too  Oh dry veggie burger  Big tits  Asian  Also Asian  Alright so where are we at  We got the Paul Anka clips  Oh I want to hear Paul Anka 
[02:24:00]  You guys want to hear Paul Anka  Listen to this  Paul Anka just losing his mind  How he treats his band  You guys might have flashbacks  Sorry here we go  Paul Anka yelling at his band  The light at times of your life  What is that blue doing over there  On all the way to the middle  And then you shut it off  What is that all about  That was a fuck up  That was a fuck up  I see that again  You're gone with the rest of them  Is that clear  That's just the way it is around here  You understand that  That's how fucking crucial this is  That's how fucking crucial this is 
[02:24:30]  Is my new catch phrase  That's how fucking crucial this is  He had his amp in the wrong setting  Yeah  It was something  You got that turn to the middle  Yeah what are you doing  It was actually something to do with  I guess the way  The lights  He was pissed at  I don't remember  The way they came in and out of songs  And he threatens their jobs  Well here's the one where he puts them on  Fucking notice  You thought  You thought  You thought  You thought eight things tonight  You're on fucking notice John  I gave you a list 
[02:25:00]  Get half a list that I gave you  We're choosing everything on it  Okay  The guys get shirts  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me  The guys get shirts  You understand  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link  The guys get shirts  The guys get shirts  Shirts  He's upset about the shirts  I know  Hanging around in the shirts  The guys get shirts  I chewed out Frank for losing one of our tiger stripe ties  But he found it  Yeah  And everything's fine  He's still in the band  Did you chew him out though?  I didn't say that it was that fucking crucial 
[02:25:30]  Sometimes  Fucking notice  But yeah  Guys wear ties  God that's awesome  This one's really good  Listen to this clip  Now guys  I'm giving you all one week  To get this together  Okay  I'm giving you one week  To play that music  The way it's supposed to be  I'm giving everybody one week  Everybody's got one week  To do it right  Because I'm in my form right now  If you guys are not going to come up 
[02:26:00]  And support me  With the enthusiasm I've got for  You need to work  I'm the only important one on that stage  And you are letting me down  Do you understand that?  I don't get it  I don't get it  Do you understand that?  I'm the only important one on that stage  I said  He's the only important one  I need to start being an asshole  See?  That is not  That is why he sold 8,000 CDs last week  Because he's an asshole  Doesn't that sound 
[02:26:30]  And that's the secret  Like a lot of fun though  Oh man  Just getting up in front of a group of people  That are supporting you  And just treating them like shit  Oh boy  That's great  I love it  Well I'm staying in this business  It's a fun guy to work with  Y'all must just be a treat  Shooting around with Paul Anka  Shitless  Well  We have one more clip  Go ahead  One more clip worth playing  Because he asked them  If they like their jobs  Now we're all important  In this mentality  If you don't care like I care  I don't need you guys  To take my money  Just like that guy last night  That fucked up my crew  And was short labor 
[02:27:00]  I lost out 20 or 30 fucking thousand dollars  Because my crew got fucked  Do you understand?  Do you understand where I'm coming from  With integrity?  That you guys are better at the same thing  Because you're all replacing  Do you all like your jobs?  Do you want your jobs?  Do you?  Then you better protect his  Because if that happens again  He does not have that job  Do you understand?  You better make it right  The band gets shirts  The guys get shirts  You don't know how crucial this is  Do you fucking like your job? 
[02:27:30]  Wow  See I like that  Do you fucking like your job?  I like the new Richard Cheese  Well done  I love Richard Cheese  My crew fucked me for 20 or 30 thousand dollars  Do you not understand integrity?  Right  I think I got it  I think I got it  Thank you guys  Thank you Paul Anka  For giving me a reason  You could go off with that Hillary Duff bitch  Oh jeez  Use that one  I actually did yell at him  That was good  But he's out of the band  You can yell at him as you're firing him  You want to hear a slice like a hammer? 
[02:28:00]  This one's pretty good too  Oh absolutely  We have millions of them  This will be the last one I guess for today  There is a lot of loose shit going on  And I am telling you  You guys are thin ice  Alright  I'm telling you right now  And when I fucking move  I slice like a fucking hammer  You've seen it?  When I take you to the band  You better look  And make sure everybody's here  When you walk in this room  I will not put up with this shit  Do you understand that?  Oh man  That's just the fucking way it is  Every one of your fucking checks cash 
[02:28:30]  With the amount on it  Do any of your checks bounce?  Do y'all get full value on your money?  I want full value on your fucking service  Do you hear me?  Oh wow  What a scumbag  I love it  He slices like a hammer  Like a hammer  When I move  I fucking pound you like a pair of scissors  That's what I use  It's like a restaurant  You know what?  When I get a nice filet mignon at a restaurant  I use a fork and a hammer  I just kind of  And it slices  And Paul Anka's right  I never thought it would work  I used to watch SCTV  And there was a character on 
[02:29:00]  The Days of the Week  Called Rocco  And he was this dumb hit man  And he'd go  Yeah I'm crazy  Crazy like a snake  It's bad idiom  We fail to consider the possibility  That maybe the band is just awful  Yeah I know  We're sticking up  Beyond the band  Maybe they were really bad  They're just fucking everything up  He really legitimately  Has a reason to yell at them  It's a bunch of like  Twelve year old kids  In a high school  Junior high band  Sitting there in their briefs  They pull back  And he's yelling at all these kids  In an orchestra  Kids are crying  Junior high 
[02:29:30]  I like his cliches  That he uses too  When you sit there  And you're yelled at a guy  That's saying  You're on thin ice  And we're only as strong  As our weakest link  It's like you're getting  Clichés thrown at you  Oh man  Stop it  A bird in the fucking hand  Is worth two in the bush  I have no idea  What that means Paul  Yeah  Fuck you  Well get your shirt  It means  Get your shirt  This is  You know  A shirt has two sleeves  And a neck hole  And you could  Ball be leaving  Out of one of them  Some of them have buttons  Yeah buttons 
[02:30:00]  And I'm buttoning down  This stage show  And trying to make  As many shirt references  You know  Don't make me  Collar you  And  Those checks are  Cast for the amounts  That are written on them  Legal  Tender  Not a penny more  Not a penny less  God that is awesome  I am so relieved  Because you know  When I came in here this morning  I was thinking  I hate Paul Anka  I hate Paul Anka  But now  I feel sorry for him  Don't you feel sorry for him  And now it's okay  That he needs that money  This is  I'm riding over here  Thinking I hate Paul Anka  I hate Paul Anka 
[02:30:30]  I know  The whole time  I hate Paul Anka  And I hate Olio Records  I hate Paul Anka  I hate Olio Records  Now you can vent  This is addicting though  We gotta play another one now  Oh please  He talks about Jesus Christ  In this clip  Jesus  The only satisfaction I'm gonna get  Is to win your fucking asses  Like the coach of a ball team  Or any god damn business  Do you get it  Understand that?  Because if you don't feel embarrassed about it  And you have no conscience  You have no heart  You have no integrity  Do you understand that?  Then all you do  Is you take the fucking money  And you've got no substance 
[02:31:00]  Remember that  People of substance and character  Care about what the fuck they do  When they fix it  Okay?  And I think you're working with me  Because I think that's the way you are  And I don't pull any punches  When you guys  I am telling you  That his job is on thin ice  And you know how fast I move  I don't care if you're a light man  A production manager  An agent  Or a theater woman  Like last night  You understand  I have a new philosophy  I don't care if it's Jesus Christ  He'll fire Jesus Christ  This guy will fire Jesus Christ  Remember when Jesus Christ 
[02:31:30]  Got fired that time  I'm sad  I don't care if it's Jesus Christ  It was so awful  Because he was always late  And he'd use that excuse  About the subway  You know  You know what the saddest part  Is watching Jesus  At unemployment  Sitting there with the woman  Going  Did you try to be the savior today?  I showed up at Paul Anka's rehearsal  Without a shirt  But he's Jesus  He doesn't have a shirt  Jesus hasn't worked since  I want to know what happened  Between Paul Anka and his ball coach  You've got to ream your ass  Like a ball coach  Like a ball coach in 6th grade 
[02:32:00]  That makes you go home  And cry at night  Curl up in the shower  In the fetal position  His little league coach  Was fucking him in the ass  That's why  Like a ball coach  Oh man  Alright one more  We've got to do one more  No no you've got to stop  One more  Don't make me a maniac  It hurts my face to laugh  Now we're all important  To me so Calvin  If you don't care like I care  I don't need you guys  To take my money  Just like that guy last night  That fucked up my crew  And was short labor  I lost out 20 or 30 fucking thousand dollars  Because my crew got fucked  Do you understand?  Do you understand where I'm coming from 
[02:32:30]  With integrity?  You understand where I'm coming from  With integrity?  Because you're all replacing  Do you all like your jobs?  Wait what's your jobs?  Yeah  Do you?  It's a little different  Then you better protect his  Because if that happens again  Remix  He does not have that job  Do you understand?  You better make it right  If you don't do the job  You're gone  And that goes for everybody  That's just the fucking way it is  Because you've got to do good  And as long as you've got it good  You've got to make it good  Get it fucking right 
[02:33:00]  That's just the way it is around here  Do you hear me?  Do you understand that?  Don't make a fucking maniac  Get the fuck out of me  There you go  Too late  There you go  It sounded like the same clip  But everyone has done it  When you're arguing  You say the same shit  Over and over again  Over and over  I'm Paul Anka  Awesome  Make a fucking maniac  Well that solves all my problems  Because if I can get that recording out there  I think that'll dip into his sales  And bring up the Richard Cheese  Uh huh  Richard this is what we're going to do  Yeah baby  It's going to make me think  What the fuck I did over here  Fucking Paul Anka 
[02:33:30]  You motherfucker  Keep him here  Keep him here  No shirt  You understand where I'm coming from  With integrity  If that came from a mafia boss  Everyone should be scared  But it's Paul Anka  Someone at one of the shows  What can he actually do?  Well they refer to him as the bat  The bat?  Because he looks like a bat  Holy the bat  Sometimes  He's got that tux on  And for some reason  The collar seems extra high  He's all tan and dark hair  Looks like George Hamilton  A bat  A bat  That's hilarious  Alright this is what we're going to do  Yeah baby  When we get back from break 
[02:34:00]  We'll do Shit Dick  Because we'll do Shit Dick  We want you guys to hear it again  Just to make sure you got it  It seems like you do  But just to make sure  Absolutely  But as we go to break  Why don't you do another  Track off your new CD there  It's ILoveRichardCheese.com  It's a little tuned by my good friends  Green Day  Don't want to be an American idiot  Don't want a nation under the new mania  Can you hear the sound of hysteria

[02:46:30]  Shots and beers  And the heroin  Oh it was fantastic  Remember at the end there  Lenzy got so out of control  We hired a bartender  Were you in for that  Were you in for that  Those days  No  We were bringing in mixed rum drinks  Into the  Umbrellas and straws  There was a blender going on  We actually had a bartender  That set up every Friday  On the old show  Every Friday  How we talked Ken Stevens  Into that  Like oh no Ken  It's like a bit  That we're doing  But no  It had nothing to do with the show  It was not a bit  It was the fact that 
[02:47:00]  We wanted to drink hard liquor  At our job  In the afternoon  And then the bartenders  Started bringing shot girls  With them  We actually had shot girls  Shot girls walking around  With a test tube  And we were doing the drinks  And it's like  Was there a velvet rope  In front of the building  You're not allowed in  You're not dressed right  Yeah  That was pretty much  We were running a bar  It was amazing  I got turned away  From the door  Oh did you  I had too many dudes with me  You can come and steal  With these guys  Yeah man  Those guys outside

The guitar?  Very pretty  Nice yeah  It's beautiful  It's haunting  Hey now come on  That's a quote from another song 
[02:54:00]  It really is  Oh what?  We're trying to redo it  We really are trying to redo it  All right  I'm nervous about this one  You're the love of my life  But it cuts like a knife  And I feel that I'm being misled  See I'm a little concerned  For I recently learned  Of the swastika tattoo on your head  And it makes you smile 
[02:54:30]  When you hear Zig Heil  You love the smell of a burning cross in the yard  You do goose step salutes  In your Doc Martin boots  And you quoted Mein Kampf  In our fifth anniversary card  I think you're a Nazi baby  Are you a Nazi?  I think you're a Nazi maybe  You keep extensive files 
[02:55:00]  On the Nuremberg trials  And you watch them  Whenever they're airing  I guess I should have known  When you bought a new bone  For your puppies  Named Goebbels and Goering  And you showed up late  To our very first date  I said how are you?  You said white power  Call me paranoid  But I'm not overjoyed  When you ask me  If I want to shower  I think you're a Nazi  Don't be lying baby 
[02:55:30]  Tell me if you're a Nazi  Are you anti-Zion maybe?  Your every dress is monogrammed SS  You hold an annual Tom Metzger bash  And it makes me irate  When you say I look great  If I wear a little tiny mustache  Your social politics 
[02:56:00]  Say that races don't mix  And you call it pure blood pollution  And whenever I'm sad  You say it's not so bad  For every problem  There's a final solution  I think you're a Nazi  Give me an answer baby  Are you a Nazi?  You drive a fucking Panzer baby  They say that love is blind 
[02:56:30]  So how could I have guessed?  But then again I met you  At the Wagner Fest  I know you're a Nazi  And that's why I'm leaving  I know you're a Nazi  Sure is my name is  Steven Lynch 
[02:57:00]  Bergstein  That's a Nazi song  That's a sweet song  I like it  That girl sounds nice  Yeah that one doesn't go over too well  At the colleges  No  They get all pissed off  It's a humor  You get how brilliant the references are in that  What a bunch of dummies  Of course  Yeah I don't think I know who Tom Metzger is  Of course not  And Gerbils and Gehring  It's a nice little history lesson 
[02:57:30]  And a love song  All in one  At the same time  All in one  They tell you not to perform that song?  Who?  The colleges?  No no  Well I've only done it twice  Oh and you get the looks right?  Yeah  I get a lot of  Fucking little dummies  That fun little shower line  I bet they groaned  Oh yeah  Oh  Oh yeah  Like they never had just legitimate showers  Not get a look  Not get a look  I was referring to  There you go 
[02:58:00]  Come on  Very lovely  That's my new one  I like it  I like it a lot  You guys want to do another one?  I like it a lot  A lot  I just don't know if Nazis are appropriate to be making fun of  I felt the tension from over there Jim  Too soon  It's too soon  You kidding?  You gave him a hard on man  He was really into that one  It's a good song  But I'd like to have a body count in there  Yeah you couldn't fit six million in there? 
[02:58:30]  No?  What's wrong with a million?  Billion  From the optimist point of view  You could have went for a trillion  There we go  My goodness  My God man  All right let's do another one from Stephen Lynch  And then we're going to get into the sex talk with the grandmas  Yeah  Hot  Another one  All right 
[02:59:00]  Let me figure out something here  How about a  Well we'll do another new one  All right  Fuck it  I'm just trying all my new shit on you guys  Why not?  What we have for?  All right  Because when you go see like you know  Zeppelin or something  If you went to see Zeppelin  When they were actually playing as a band  Yeah  You wouldn't want him to do the hits  You'd want him to do like stuff you aren't familiar with  Right  I hope John Paul Jones is a 20 minute keyboard solo  Exactly 
[02:59:30]  Actually Anthony I think you'd rather have them do the hits  Thank you for adding that  All right  This is a song of hope  Oh  I thought the last one was  No this isn't a song of hope  This is kind of the antidote to the Craig Christ song  Oh  It's because I figured since I did a Jesus song 
[03:00:00]  A God you know type song  I'd have to do kind of give the opposition equal time  So that's what this one's kind of about  All right here we go  Ever since first man has walked this earth I have been here  To whisper seeds of doubt and evil thoughts into his ear  I am the beast the outcast angel fallen from on high  I go by many names but there is one you can't deny 
[03:00:30]  My name is Satan  Hi everybody  Let me tell you a little bit about myself  Okay here we go  My friends all call me old scratch  And I am a Capricorn  I turn on cyromagic walks  And killing the unborn  I got little devil horns and a little goatee  Little devil eyes help a little devil see  Little coven hoops make it kind of hard to ski  I am Satan  Mephistopheles another name I go by 
[03:01:00]  My real name is the Elzebub  But you can call me Beals  I love to watch Fox News and then go club some baby seals  Then I'll take a bubble bath and drink a Zinfandel  Try to wash off that baby seal smell  Then I'll make a toast to me  Hey  Here's to my hell  My name is Satan  To carry on my evil ways I went and had a son 
[03:01:30]  And now he makes his living as a singing comedian  I'm in every Zeppelin album  I'm in all Rush Limbaugh's rants  I'm the reason that the Boston Red Sox even had a chance  And if I want to eat your soul I'll just throw it on the griddle  Don't need to make a deal I don't need to tell a riddle  And fuck Charlie Danis I don't care if you can fiddle  I'm Satan  The devil went down to Georgia  He was looking for a soul to steal  Which is fucking bullshit because I would not be caught dead in Georgia 
[03:02:00]  Okay it's like oh my god  Sick, sick, sick  I like the new stuff  You can tell I've been doing a lot of musical theater lately  That was very influenced by the great white way  I guess so  The great white way  What are you working on nowadays?  Well I just finished my tour and I'm recording the new album this Monday  And then I'm taking the summer off to try to write some shit 
[03:02:30]  And then tour again and then I'm doing the  Well it doesn't matter what I'm doing in the winter  I'm sorry I just brought that up actually  Really?  What are you doing in the winter?  Having a kid?  No, no, no, no kids  A show?  A show, yes  A show  What show?  It hasn't been formally announced yet  Oh really?  Sounds like somebody got a show on maybe a satellite network  No, no, no  Get out!  A stage show  A stage show, yes  Is it a revival? 
[03:03:00]  It is not a revival  It is an adaptation of a hit movie  Adaptation of a hit movie  What decade movie?  Uh, 90s or 2000s  Either late 90s or early 2000s  Schindler's List the musical  Yes  He's essential to the war effort  I auditioned with my Nazi song  Got the lead  I pardon you  I pardon you  Big brown ring  Round about the big brown ring 
[03:03:30]  Round about the big brown ring  I like the little boy song  Why am I standing in shit?  Devil in a little red dress  I like it  Let's work on it  I can't even say  Someone wants better than my head 
[03:04:00]  You're awful  Oh wow  You can do it  No  No  Oh go ahead  Best leave that one alone  Oh yeah  Hey everybody  It's Stephen Lynch  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  And also I have herpes  10-2-0-2  The Opie and Anthony Show  Ah, a little Jimmy Norton in studio with us  We're about to play Jim Norton on the Tonight Show  With Jay Leno  What a moment  It was a huge moment for Jimmy's career 
[03:04:30]  That was good  That was awful  Opie saying Jimmy's on the show  And Jimmy just going  Way to show excitement for you, huh?  Yeah  Leno  Jimmy  You forgot the rest of it  Where Anthony comes to the conclusion  That Jimmy will be leaving the program  In a matter of months  And they'll be stuck with Voss 
[03:05:00]  Yes  As a replacement  I do go on and on about that whole thing  I see you making it big  And having no option whatsoever  But to leave this program  Please, I'm going nowhere  And Jimmy, we were very excited for you  Thank you  Yeah, extremely excited  Picture yourselves  Here's what you are  Picture yourselves  You're one lung  You're one lung  And you're another lung  And I am a hard black thing  Stuck to it  You got me to snow it  That was my favorite part of Three's Company 
[03:05:30]  When Chrissy Snow would laugh  That and when Jack would fall over  And then get back  Unlike  On the side of this new program  And I might have been funny  If I didn't say get back  Get back  You get them back  Get back  Get back  The worst  Of Bogey and Anthony  I know  And Jimmy was on  The Tonight Show last night  With Jay Leno  Did you see it yet?  I watched it last night  My bets are in  I give Jimmy  Six more months on this show 
[03:06:00]  And he's gone  That's it?  And we lose him  Yeah  He's going to be much too big  The offers are going to come in  And then we're going to be stuck  With this motherfucker  Who's outside the glass right now  Buying Rolls Royce off the eBay  As Jimmy is propelled to the ultimate stardom  And forgets our names  Yeah  We'll be stuck  Ladies and gentlemen  Rich Voss  You have a movie premiere coming up?  Rich, I guess we've got to start giving you a lot more respect  Because we're going to be losing Jim Norton soon  We're still losing Jimmy  We're doing our pilot next week 
[03:06:30]  Wait a minute, what?  We're doing our pilot next week  You are  But I, you know  We don't know if it's going to be picked up or anything  Until you're on the Tonight Show  Killing like Jimmy did last night  It was ridiculous  He sat down with Leno  And went back and forth with him for ten more minutes  And it was just killer stuff  It was sharp  Very funny  And like very on the edge for network television  Alright, listen  Elliot, exaggeration  It wasn't  Elliot, exaggeration  Elliot, exaggeration 
[03:07:00]  What show were you watching?  He killed  No, I said he killed  Too busy bidding on a Sherman tank  You just picked the worst E name too  Elliot  You should have said Ernie  First of all  Or Earl  Ernie better than Elliot  For what we learned today  Remember that  I'm bidding on a 747  Oh, you're bidding on a 747  He killed  He killed  I was watching  I was really happy  And I'm probably the only comic  That called him before  And said good luck  Have a good set  Because none of our friends  Are nice enough to do that  Of course not 
[03:07:30]  And he did  He destroyed  And he was so  You know what?  He was so comfortable  Yeah, that's what it was  He sat down  Completely comfortable  Because the B material  When you're that comfortable  You know, B material comes out  B material  B material  Yeah  It's too bad that the plane  Lost his luggage  And he had to wear that outfit  But  Yeah, we gotta rag him about that  What the hell was he wearing?  Bonnie wrote that  Really?  Good one, Bonnie  Why don't we talk to Bonnie?  We don't need to talk to you anymore 
[03:08:00]  That is funny, man  He came out  And he was wearing  Just a t-shirt  And some  That's his favorite shirt  Oversized shirt  That's unbuttoned  Yeah  It was like one of Tyson's shirts  That's one of his favorite shirts  He's worn that  For a lot of his big gigs  I was really excited  You know what is so exciting  Besides that he's a friend  That he's doing such edgy material  Yeah  Finally that somebody's getting on  You know  On network TV  Yeah  I mean, I did a prime time  But  And he's doing stuff  Nice try, Vos 
[03:08:30]  That he's doing  It's not about you today  Well, yeah, it is  I didn't take a train, all right  To talk about meaty breasts, all right  I mean, to talk about it Wednesday  His mic stinks, right?  Is that why you're coming in?  Yeah, it is low  Why is that?  Is he pushed all the way up?  Vos, just jump over to that mic  See if that works better  Damn it  I have him cranked, too  That's better  I don't feel comfortable over here  But, you know, doing that edgy material he did  And it was great when he said about, you know  Too old about the girl 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh my God  Well, we got the whole thing  We're going to do  We're going to give Jim Norton's stand-up  You know, a listen here  From The Tonight Show  And then his couch time as well  Yeah  Yeah, but going back to what Anthony said  Anthony thinks six months he's off this show  He's gone  He's gone  So I guess we've got to start treating you a little better  This is  He's going to hit  Let me tell you  If that HBO show hits  And then his special  Let me tell you something  He's going to do really well  He's going to be able to pick up  Like fives instead of fours now 
[03:09:30]  But he'll move on  He's doing this gig  Because it definitely pays his bills  He's really got no other huge source of income  Hawking his t-shirts and CDs  But, I don't know  I think offers will come in  Where he's not going to be able to turn them down  It's going to be for more money than he's making doing this  And that's when we lose him  Bye-bye  And then what we do  We just hose down that seat  And welcome Rich Voss to the program 
[03:10:00]  Like when someone gets killed at Disney  It happens every year or so  Someone's on a ride  They get killed at Disney  What does Disney do?  Shut the ride down  Close the park down  They put up the little barriers  They hose it down  Open it up like it never happened  You're back in business  Let me explain about Norton  Because Norton's like my best friend  I've known him  Norton's middle name should be Stepping Stone  But, you know, he might have used  You know, he went from you like Dice  To you, to Colin  Back to you  But here's the thing 
[03:10:30]  He'll hit big  But he'll self-destruct  And something will happen  And it'll probably be with a black male  With a wig  And what's going to happen is  They're not going to tolerate his nonsense  In Hollywood  And he's going to be back  He will be back  Beaten down  He'll have a little cash  And, you know  But he's going to hit big  And then he's going to fall  I see like  And I want to be outside his house  When he has that garage sale  And he starts stealing all that stuff  Outside his million dollar condo  Yeah, because it's closer than eBay in Florida  What's that?  Because it's closer than eBay in Florida  Oh, look at the sprained leg football players 
[03:11:00]  Talking to me now  I'm fine right now  Oh, you are?  You want to go oompa loompa?  Let's go  You guys  Want to play me in golf or catch?  I'll play you in golf or catch  Oh, my God  My money's on him  Wow, really?  Because he drives the ball far  I'll take three clubs and beat you  Are you out of your mind?  I'll take a putter, seven iron, and a three wood  Is he a scratch golfer?  You have no idea who you're talking about  Is he a scratch?  Talking to, I mean  All right  Three clubs and you'll be  300-yard drives, no problem  Big deal  Drive for show, putt for dough  Probably 
[03:11:30]  Oh, you'd make that up?  I like that  You should get that on a t-shirt  Actually  You should get that on a t-shirt  I never heard of that  You heard of that  Actually, I played golf with both of you guys  It would be a very good match  He drives the shit out of the ball  And hits it straight  Yeah  But on the greens  He's like a gorilla  He has no touch whatsoever  To be fair, when we played  It was January  And I haven't played in six months  So  That's my disclaimer  I saw him drive a par four  Yeah  And then four points  Look at those big gorilla arms  He's going to touch the ball  It's going to fly back into the rough 
[03:12:00]  That was a donut hole  This guy has no touch  But man, he can hit the shit out of the ball  Very good  So did you guys talk about Michael?  No, we'll get into that after the break  What we're going to do here  We're going to play Norton's set from Jay Leno last night  Money, man  It's unbelievable  The video's up on opianthony.com  Foundrymusic.com  And when you listen to this  Just remember  This is on fucking NBC  That's what we're saying in the office  When we're watching this  We're like  Jay Leno  You know  I wasn't buying Norton's whole argument 
[03:12:30]  Between Jay Leno and Letterman  But I'm just starting to see it now  Yeah  I'm just starting to see it  You get away with a lot more  I understand that now  Unfortunately  Listening to audio too  You don't get the expression thing  Because there were a couple of times  That he got the audience roaring  Just from a look  He looked over and did  When he looked at Hilary Duff  Yeah  Like, hi  You know  And she was just looking into the eyes of a rapist  And Jay, you know  Turns to him and just says 
[03:13:00]  17, 17  And he's like  Bam, two seconds  Oh, too young  Too old  I stink  Too old  This is a huge day  I rot  God, I fucked that whole thing up, didn't I?  But you know why I think he gets away with a lot more?  Thank you  Thank you  Boss had to jump in  And now it's all fucked up  No, I was acknowledging that  I had to call myself a dick for that one  But I was just going to hose it off  Hose it down  I was going to hose that joke off  Move on  What were you going to say, boss?  I think he gets away with a lot more on Leno  Because Leno still does stand-up 
[03:13:30]  And he's a stand-up comic  He's out there  So he, you know  He lets you get away with more  He appreciates it more  Yeah  You know what I'm saying?  It's not like  Yeah, he knows what comedy is about  What comics are  He's out at the clubs  Leno goes to the clubs every week  Letterman has no clue  Alright, let's go to Bill in North Carolina  Bill, what's up?  Hey, first off  Let me preface the whole thing  With Jimmy is freaking awesome  He killed last night  It was wonderful  But I'm just sick and tired  Of Opie and Anthony  And everybody out there  Caressing Rich Voss' ego 
[03:14:00]  Every time he comes on the show  Oh, he killed  He's a freaking nobody, man  He gets on there  And it's just  You guys start telling me  What a great job Jimmy did  And as soon as he does  Oh, I'm doing a pilot  Oh, Bonnie this  You know, Rich  We don't give a fuck  You are a worthless piece of shit  Yeah, how much money  Are you making this week?  How much money  Are you making this week?  Why sucking cock for it, Rich?  How much money  Are you making this week?  I made a fucking cock for it, Rich  Neither am I  How much money are you making?  How much  Cheap-ass used car sales  And motherfuckers  Oh, hey, hey  You know what?  Obviously I'm doing my job  Because look at how angry you are 
[03:14:30]  I'm doing my job as a comic  Because you're so angry  Now keep listening, faggot  All right  Yeah, Bill  Can you go on eBay  And buy a Rolls Royce?  Yes, that's right  All right  And let me tell you something  I've done three network TV shows  In the last two years, stupid  All right  Let's go to Will in Jersey  Will, what's up?  Hey, guys  Hey, make it fast, Will  Yeah, all right  I just wanted to say  Do you notice when Jim sits down?  Jaylon will retract that little footstool  He had up for Hillary Dump  That was funny  And Jimmy's feet 
[03:15:00]  Don't quite hit the ground  He's got to do a little  His feet were dangling off the big guest chair  And Jay said something like  You don't need that, do you?  And he pulled away the thing  That Hillary Duff had to use  And there's a little electronic thing  And Jimmy was like on his tippy toes  Trying to touch the floor  His little feet were dangling down  In that huge chair  That's all I got, guys  All right, good enough  Let's go to Brian in Boston  Brian, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys  Morning  Do us all a favor  If Jimmy leaves  Can you just pick someone from random  At Uppenway?  Oh, we'll do that old gag 
[03:15:30]  Yeah  Hey, we're going to be checking ticket numbers  At Fenway Park  And deciding who's going to be  A co-host on the Opie and Anthony show  Stupid hack radio bit  Ugh  All right, why don't we play  Norton's set from last night  On the Leno show  All righty  On the Leno show  Jay Leno's Tonight Show  Mm-hmm  Huge, huge night for Jim Norton  And a nice little mention  For the Opie and Anthony program as well  Absolutely  That's not going to hurt us at all, huh?  That's very good  So without further ado 
[03:16:00]  Check out the audio  The video's up on our website  He's on the Opie and Anthony show  On XM Satellite Radio  Every single morning  June 25th  He'll be at the State Theater  In Falls Church, Virginia  Please welcome  Jim Norton  Thank you  Thank you  How are you?  Good  There's always this weird moment  When you first look at the audience  Like, I'm hoping you're going to be a great crowd  And you guys are kind of looking 
[03:16:30]  And hoping I don't suck  And the most common question you get as a comedian  What happens if you tell a joke  And it bombs?  To be honest  I tend to just go to the next joke  There aren't exactly a lot of options  Not like I can run through the room  And tickle you individually  And it's not uncomfortable for a comic  It's a part of our job  The reason that frightens audience members  Is because in your own lives  You don't have the next joke option  It's much harder to bomb in real life  Like, you ever try to be funny 
[03:17:00]  Around your girlfriend's family  Or your co-workers  And it gets a zero?  Like, the kind of bomb  Where they just avoid eye contact with you  For a little while?  You gotta just stand there  And soak in your humiliation  With your stupid eye-bombed face  You ever try to play it off  Like you didn't mean it to be funny?  You ever have a joke bomb so badly  It may have been a serious statement?  So you try to sneak out of it  By going, oh, I'm just saying  You know, maybe you're at work 
[03:17:30]  The big meeting's about to start  Your boss walks in  There's no eye in team  You're like, yeah, but there's two in syphilis  I'm just saying  I'm actually enjoying my time  Back in Los Angeles  I live in New York  I got ripped off this week, man  I went for a massage  Did you know there are  Legitimate massage places?  I, honest to God 
[03:18:00]  I had no idea  I thought she was kidding  She finishes with my feet  She's like, all done  I'm like  It was awful  I'm on my stomach for 55 minutes  She finally turns me over  And she said  Alright, I'm gonna crack your toes  Which means she grabs each toe  Squeezes it  And yanks on it  Which, you know  Right idea, wrong location  I felt like such a creep 
[03:18:30]  Every time she grabbed her toe  I tried to scooch down  Two and a half feet  I'm a lonely man  I've been single almost three years  Kind of playing the field  I call it playing the field  You might call it picking up prostitutes  And I've fallen into this place  With this girl I know  This horrible place  But I have become  The guy friend  Is there anything more repulsive 
[03:19:00]  Than being the guy friend  And women  You always know when we like you  And you deny it  Even to your girlfriends  You're like  I think he's in love with you  You're like  I don't know  We're just friends  He enjoys taking me to the airport  And there is nothing worse  As a man  Than when you're hitting on a woman  And she has that awful  Blocking male friend  Because you can just feel his energy  You're trying to talk to her  He's like  Dude don't hurt her  She's like my sister  Is she really you 
[03:19:30]  Fun draining cancer  Why does a guy  Always make a sister figure  Out of some brawless model  Who looks like Jessica Simpson  You never hear a man  Claiming that  About a fat chick  With facial hair  Even if she is your sister  You keep it under your hat  Who's that  I don't know  We met at a barbecue once  I think we have the same parents  So I don't know  What to do about this girl  I like  I really am very uncomfortable  Around women  I know you look at me  And you think  God it must be so easy for you 
[03:20:00]  If I get really nervous  I mean this  Was just a front  And for me  Making the first move  Means you roll down  The passenger window  You know  Beep beep  If she gets in  You hope it's not a guy  You ever make that mistake  You don't get your money back 
[03:20:30]  That's why my motto  Is toughen up and finish  Hey look  I'm not gay  This is a matter of economics  I wish I was gay  Gay men are lucky  You can go out and rob banks  If you get caught and go to jail  Thanks a lot everybody  You guys were great  Thank you  There you have it  A huge night for Jim Norton 
[03:21:00]  On Jay Leno's Tonight Show  Unbelievable huh  Yeah  That was huge  Then he sat down  Yeah that's what I'm getting now  The couch  The couch  The all important couch  A lot of comics  Do Leno  You know  But then the couch  The sitting  The chatting  That's huge  It's kind of weird too  Because  It looked fake  I was saying  It looked fake  When I watched it  It looked like 
[03:21:30]  You went to an amusement park  And they kind of make you look like  You're on Leno  Or something  Yeah  Because it's Jimmy  And he's sitting there  And he's talking to Jay Leno  And it's on the Tonight Show  And Hillary Duff is next  And it's like they just  Popped him in there  Using some kind of  Green screen technology  Or something  You know we're pretty jaded  At this point  We've seen a lot of celebrities  And stuff  But I gotta tell you  You're so right  Seeing our  Our old pal  On Jay Leno  Last night  Our little mess  It just didn't seem real  It was like  It was really  It was cool as shit 
[03:22:00]  To check out  But it just didn't seem right  And you know what  He killed the first time  No could you just move over there  Jesus fucking Christ  What that was supposed to be fixed  Yeah and then they move him over  The fucking Mike sucks  And we need all Mikes today  You know  God  He killed the first time  So the pressure  For him to re-kill  You know what I mean  Yeah  The first time he was on Leno  He killed that night  So I mean  He killed even more this time  Yep  You know  And that's huge  They'll invite him back now  He'll become a regular  Then he'll do the sitcom 
[03:22:30]  And then  And then he'll do movies  And forget it  Bye bye  Bye bye Jimmy  Let's say hi to George in Texas  George  Hey what's up guys  What's up  Oh not much  I'm just wondering  If anybody else noticed  Hillary Duff  She looked like she was  Pretty coked out of her mind  She was going like  A hundred miles an hour  Coked out  She's sticking to her teeth  Like  She's 17 years old  You guys are too much man  Yeah she looked coked out man  That's all our dream  Yeah she was all energetic 
[03:23:00]  On the Leno show  Or something  Right  She should have just lounged  What should she have  Fallen asleep on the couch  Or something  Dude she looked like  She was a vikoden  Or something  She was all slow  And shit  You would have known  If she was coked out  Because she has the hugest teeth  I mean  She can't hide the fact  That they would be grinding  Yeah  She's too fat  To be coked out  Fat  She's like 98 pounds  That's a good joke actually  Chris in Dayton Ohio  Chris what's up  Hey I wanted to tell you guys 
[03:23:30]  To die  We watched that at work last night  And you guys sold two ex-m units  To the guys that never laugh  At anything on Leno  And they laughed at Norton  Horribly  They love that guy  And he just killed Hillary Duff  I mean it was great  Alright very good  It was a good thing to see  Yeah the looks he was shooting over at  Were just frightening  Alright why don't we play  The couch time then  So after Norton's stand up  He got to sit down  With Jay Leno  A huge honor I would assume 
[03:24:00]  A lot of these comedians  They just do their thing  And that's it  Yeah  But Norton got to do  Some couch time  Sit down  Do the couch time  And he killed there too  So are you liking L.A. now  I know you are  A dyed in the wool New York  Are you enjoying your time here  I actually  I used to hate L.A.  But I have one stupid hobby  And L.A. is great for that  I get pictures  With celebrities  Which I annoyed you for  The first time I was here  And I've been doing it for years  And it's very rare  That I'm ever turned down  By a celebrity  For a picture or an autograph  And I finally realized why  It's because I look 
[03:24:30]  Like I could be a problem  Yeah  There is just something  About my rapidly blinking eyes  That's why I took the picture  Yeah I just  I don't want any problem  With this guy  It's not that people  Think I'm going to kick their ass  But I do look like  I might bite your face  Yeah  And I came to realize  This years ago  I'm an Ozzy Osbourne fanatic  And my friend sneaks me  Into MTV  He's like  Alright man  Just kind of hang back  So I walk by an open  Dressing room door  And there is Ozzy  So I stare  And Ozzy is talking 
[03:25:00]  And he looks out at me  And when he looks at me  I smiled and licked my lips  And he kind of walked out of view  So I couldn't stare at him anymore  And I realized  I'd made him uncomfortable  And then it dawned on me  Do you know what a weirdo  You have to look like  To make Ozzy Osbourne  Any other celebrities  That you've seen  I don't even necessarily  Have to be a fan  I remember I was opening  For Dice in Vegas  Years ago  And Tiger Woods  Was in the crowd  I don't like golf  I think golf sucks 
[03:25:30]  And golf clubs are great  For assaulting people  Yeah  But I like Tiger Woods  So I walk up to him  After the show  And I'm nervous  And I'm like  Hello Mr. Woods  And he is such a sweet guy  He's like  You were awesome  Which was odd  To hear a black guy go  Awesome  Yeah he's black  And I wanted to have  Like a nice moment  With him  I just got really intimidated  He's like  You were awesome  I'm like  Thanks man  You golf good 
[03:26:00]  You ever open your mouth  And wish you had a shotgun  With a toe attachment  I have one second  With this icon  I sound like an extra  From M.A.S.H.  You golf good  Me have head wounds  Hawkeye  Well how about dating  Are you seeing anyone  Right now  I do  And I give people  The creeps  It's hard for me  To date  I have a tendency  To be too toothy  When I smile  Which really grosses  A girl out  If you're in a bar  You're like  Where are you from  And then I rubbed my hands 
[03:26:30]  Together vigorously  Yeah that's  While staring at her  Cleavage and mumbling  Nice  Yeah that's  I can see how that  Could be a problem  Uh  Hi  Hi  Hey did you uh  We just step away  With that problem  Every once in a while  Yeah  17  What's that  17  Oh  Troll  Now did you watch 
[03:27:00]  The uh  Did you watch  The Tyson fight  Center  Uh  The Tyson fight  I actually did not watch  I had my  Probably my most  Embarrassing experience  Uh  Trying to get a  Tyson autograph  Uh  Years ago  In uh  In New York  About five years ago  Uh  Mike Tyson's outside  The comedy cell  With a big entourage  And I go up  To get an autograph  And his bodyguard  Goes  Whoa whoa whoa man  Where are you going  And I said  Oh man  I just wanted to get  An autograph  He goes  Sorry man  Mike's not meeting  Anyone tonight  And I actually said  But he's the champ
