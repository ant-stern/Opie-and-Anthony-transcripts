<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock analyzing a viral YouTube video of a heavily medicated child ("David") making incoherent statements after a dental procedure.  The hosts found the video hilarious and played several clips, highlighting the child's ramblings.  This was followed by a pre-recorded interview with Ron Howard, who discussed his career, from his role as Opie on *The Andy Griffith Show* to his directing work on films like *Frost/Nixon* and *Angels & Demons*. He also touched upon his experiences working with Tom Hanks and his perspective on the "Jump the Shark" phenomenon related to *Happy Days*.  The hosts jokingly questioned the lack of violence involving the Fonz.  Next, the show played audio of comedian Bob Kelly, whose incoherent political rant was heavily mocked by the hosts, who described his performance as "blithering idiot" behavior.  The show concluded this portion with Sam Roberts delivering a requested open-hand slap across E-Rock's chest, leading to a vulgar discussion about the impact and resulting handprint, and a mention of an implied "motorboat" action.

The next segment featured a studio visit from professional wrestler The Iron Sheik, preceded by banter among the hosts referencing old food and a sandwich. Drew Boogie, a remix artist, briefly promoted his work.  Sam Roberts' significant role in booking the Sheik, resulting in a memorable, unspecified photographic moment for the show, was discussed.  The Iron Sheik arrived with what he claimed was the Intercontinental Championship belt (though the hosts referred to it as a hubcap and a flag) and a DVD.  He then launched into a series of offensive, homophobic and antisemitic rants against Hulk Hogan, the Ultimate Warrior, and his agent, Eric, filled with insults and boasts about his sexual prowess, particularly his claimed 10-inch penis.  The hosts laughed along and participated in the conversation, which also covered The Iron Sheik's wrestling career, financial struggles, drug use, and personal life.  A significant portion focused on the debate of whether E-Rock should see "proof" of the Sheik's claimed penis size. Sean from Kayfabe Commentaries was briefly mentioned, and his "Iron Sheik Roast" video was promoted.

The following segment focused on the aftermath of The Iron Sheik's visit.  The conversation shifted from a story about a comedian (presumably Pete) soiling himself after drinking eight beers to the resulting smell of urine and a large wet spot on The Iron Sheik's pants.  The hosts described and reacted to the stain extensively, with photos being passed around. Bill Burr was briefly mentioned in this segment.  The Iron Sheik later returned, seemingly oblivious to the incident, posing for photos, unintentionally highlighting the stain. This was followed by a studio appearance of comedians Jim Florentine, Jim Jefferies, and Jim Norton. The conversation focused on their experiences with drunk sex and humorous, explicit anecdotes about encounters with women while on the road.


The show then played a previous segment featuring Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock, focusing on E-Rock’s disgusted reaction to eating a sardine and onion sandwich, a raw potato, and buttermilk, a meal described as a "treat" by Sam Roberts's father. E-Rock’s struggle to eat and his near-vomiting were heavily featured.  This was followed by a "worst of 2009" segment featuring a call from Ted Sheckler, describing his bizarre movie memorabilia collection (Marlon Brando’s mustache hairs, Darth Vader's alleged footprint, Scatman Crothers' toenails etc.) and commentary from Richie from O-Town.  A surprise birthday call from Christopher Lloyd, in character as Doc Brown, followed, with participation from Jim Norton.  The final segment featured a studio interview with Penthouse Pets Taya Parker and Shana Lanay, which devolved into a tense exchange after Taya became upset by the hosts' crude and sexually suggestive comments and images. Taya eventually left, visibly upset.

Another segment discussed Lainey, a previous female guest who was upset despite being briefed on the show's raunchy nature, and a video of her past appearance, described with vulgar language.  This transitioned into a studio interview with 50 Cent, who promoted his video game, *Blood in the Sand*. The conversation included details about his game development, experiences performing for soldiers in Iraq, business ventures (especially Vitamin Water), a graphic feud with Rick Ross, his past experiences, philosophy on success, the competitive nature of hip-hop, his acting career, and his views on violence in media. The segment concluded with the hosts jokingly claiming Sam Roberts was taking all of Sirius XM's money.

[00:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts and fellow New Jersey Devils fan, E-Rock. 
[00:05:30]  Is that good? 
[00:06:00]  And so somebody saw me in the post on my Facebook, and so somebody saw me in the post on my Facebook, then two days later, somebody posts, hey, I love how you shop at this mall.  It's the second time I've seen you there.  And I had to post it, and I had to post it, and I had to post it, and I had to post it, and I had to post a thing on my Facebook that said, look, if you see me in public, just come up and say hello. Don't later be like, oh, I was watching you.  Was this from your girlfriend? 
[00:06:30]  It was fantastic. It was fantastic. It was fantastic. I know. And what it is is I found on YouTube, and it took over the internet, so it's hard to really take credit for it. But a kid went to the dentist and got all drugged up on painkillers and whatnot. And so his dad decided to ask him questions and videotape him. 
[00:07:00]  I believe the young boy's name was David.  And this is O&A and Jim playing the audio of David Goes to the Dentist.  On the worst of 2009.  Opie and Anthony.  He stepped on me.  You're ready to be fucked, man.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, the dentist. That's where we're at. So the dad videotapes his kid and laughs at how doped up he is after the dentist trip.  Why is Sam here? Do you have a Dilbert update? Is that why you're here?  Dilbert?  What do you got, Sam?  I just was here in case you had any questions about this audio.  You like it or nah?  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of like it?  Yeah, it's not bad.  All right. So you got the dad videotaping his son. Here we go.  How did it go?  I didn't feel anything.  I didn't feel anything.  Oh, God. 
[00:08:00]  I'm in.  This is funny.  The little kid is all left up?  Yeah, there's a couple of really good little kid lines in it.  How old is the kid?  He's probably like eight.  And what did he... Oh, Uncle Paul.  And he...  Oh, Dr. Paul.  What did he have...  What was he given? Like, what kind of drugs?  I don't know.  I think that he was under for getting his tooth out or something because he had stitches in his gums. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  So they must have knocked him out with whatever.  Yeah, maybe they gave him some of that Valium or something.  Valium and doped him up.  And then put him through some of that gas, that nitrous oxide.  Yeah.  Is there outrage?  No, there's remixes, but not outrage.  Oh, let's get some of the remixes.  Oh, that's good.  Look at the kid.  How did it go?  I didn't feel anything.  Yeah.  I feel something.  Kind of felt good, didn't it? 
[00:09:00]  Is this real life?  Yeah.  What did he say?  Is this real life?  Oh, this kid rules.  Oh, soap in there, you little bastard.  So been there.  You're never not there.  Is this real life?  This is a kid effed up.  Yes.  That's what they think.  Is this real life?  I feel funny.  Why do we give little kids stuff like that?  It's just a preview for what you could do when you get older. 
[00:09:30]  Dude, this would be, if I had a kid, if I was ever cursed with a child, I would have  him drugged up all the time because this is hysterical.  Oh.  Is this real life?  Yeah, this is real life.  Okay, now I have two fingers.  Good.  I have four fingers.  Let's find him more fingers as he goes. 
[00:10:00]  He has a little tooth missing.  Yeah.  Apparently the lad had to have an extraction.  Yes, he did.  Wow.  He's hysterical.  Is this real life?  It gets better.  Yes.  This next track is amazing.  You feel good?  I can't see anything.  Yes, you can.  Stay in your seat.  Yeah!  I think I've drank with this kid. 
[00:10:30]  The video's amazing.  The video's amazing.  And then he just falls back in his seat after that scream.  He sits way up and just starts screaming.  Leaves forward.  This is hysterical.  Oh, wow.  You feel good?  I can't see anything.  Yes, you can.  Stay in your seat.  I don't feel tired. 
[00:11:00]  You don't?  Draw stitches.  Uh-huh.  Why can't I touch it?  Because it'll mess up the stitches.  You have four eyes.  Yeah.  You have four eyes.  I feel funny.  Why is this happening to me?  It's just from the medicine.  Okay?  Is this going to be forever? 
[00:11:30]  Forever?  What was the last one?  Is this going to be forever?  He thought he was going to be all effed up for the rest of his life.  But he's probably hoping that the father says yes.  Yes.  Right on.  This is too goddamn funny.  What a cute boy.  Oh, he's all effed up.  It's going to start a new trend.  You know, there's other fathers out there a little jealous going,  Oh, I'll get my bastard.  Is this going to be forever?  All doped up on film.  It's just, you don't hear these questions out of your adult drug addict friends. 
[00:12:00]  They're the innocent little kid questions of how effed up he is.  How is this going to last forever?  How is this kid going to avoid like pod and alcohol and pills when he gets older?  Well, when he gets older, I think, you know, you got to throw a little agent.  But how do you tell him it's a bad thing?  Yeah.  He's loving it.  He starts writing song parodies with his brother.  And the next thing you know, it does last forever. 
[00:12:30]  It's just from the medicine.  Okay.  It's just going to last forever.  Plus, he's famous now for being high.  Yeah.  When he gets older, he's always going to be the high kid.  YouTube kid who's high.  You're the high kid from YouTube.  Yeah.  Give me some heroin.  Why is this happening to me?  It's okay, bud.  It's just from the medicine.  Okay?  Is this going to be forever? 
[00:13:00]  No.  No, it won't be forever.  Ugh.  Just laughing at him.  Laughing and videotaping him.  That rules.  What a scream.  That's funny, man.  How many views has it gotten?  It's gotten almost 4 million.  Holy crap.  Look at that.  When was it posted?  This video just hit probably earlier in the week.  Yes.  That is what you call your viral video, man.  That's a touchdown right there. 
[00:13:30]  That's a biggie.  It's pushing 4 million.  It's got everything that makes a great video.  The cute little kid, drug addiction.  Yes.  When I saw this video, I pulled the audio on a version where the description was in Spanish  and it had Spanish subtitles on it.  Oh, really?  Yes.  It's worldwide.  It's a phenomenon.  That is really good.  Absolutely.  You know what?  We could probably just chalk it up to way over 4 million because I'm seeing in the related 
[00:14:00]  videos, there's at least 3 or 4 other reposts of this video in a different form.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like of the top viewed YouTube videos, it's like 6 of them.  Phew.  Wow.  Yeah.  Guy hit a home run with that one.  I love the scream.  This is going to be forever.  And then he just screams for no reason.  What a little maniac.  That kid, you know what?  That kid's a punk.  He knows what he's doing.  And it would be great if they arrested him.  They want to give Michael Phelps a hard time. 
[00:14:30]  How about this little junkie?  Arrest the little kid.  I feel fucked.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  I like this in the background.  What the fuck is it with you?  Is this real life?  No, shut the fuck up.  All right?  Okay, now.  No.  Okay, now I have two fingers.  Oh, good for you.  Four fingers.  You're un-fucking-believable.  I'm fucking serious. 
[00:15:00]  You're a nice guy.  You're a nice guy.  But I don't fucking cut it when you're bullshitting and fucking around like this on set.  What don't you fucking understand?  Give me a fucking answer.  I can't see anything.  I'm going to fucking kick your fucking ass.  You know, shut up for a second, all right?  What the fuck are you doing?  Fuck's sake, man, you amateur.  I don't feel tired. 
[00:15:30]  Seriously, man.  You and me, we're fucking darn professionals.  Hello, this is Cloris Leachman.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to The Worst of 2009 so far on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's The Worst of 2009, The Worst of Opie and Anthony so far.  And we've had a lot of celebrity guests come through the studio this year. 
[00:16:00]  But maybe the biggest could have been Ron Howard.  I'm Iraq, and of course, that was primetime Sam Roberts.  Ron Howard, the original Opie.  How could you not be listening to this?  It's true.  It's Opie meets Opie on The Opie and Anthony Show.  He described where the name came from, talked a little about the movie Angels and Demons.  He wasn't afraid to talk about, you know, Andy Griffith and Happy Days, jumping the shark.  It was just such a good interview.  I just had such a great time listening.  We can't do any justice describing this. 
[00:16:30]  You just have to listen for yourself.  It was so, so good.  So this is Opie meets Opie on The Worst of 2009 so far for you and The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to The Worst.  Holy shit.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, fuck it.  Oh, fuck it.  Yes, that's your answer.  That's your answer to everything.  Ladies and gentlemen, Ron Howard.  How you doing?  Hello.  Nice to see you.  What's up, Ron?  Hi.  Can we call you Ron or Mr. Howard? 
[00:17:00]  Ron.  I know.  He's like a big director.  But I answered almost anything.  Yep.  Ron, you know why you're here?  What happened to Chuck?  Of course.  Of course.  That's such a deep, dark, complicated question.  Actually, we want to ask you why no one ever beat up Fonz.  We talk about that on our show all the time.  He's this tough guy, but we never saw him fight anybody.  But everyone was scared of him.  The beauty of it.  The beauty of it.  It's all mental.  It's all mental.  You had the reach on him and everything. 
[00:17:30]  If you just would have cracked him once.  Just one pop, one time.  He never would have bossed you around like that.  Dragged into the bathroom all the time.  All that stuff.  It was a little weird.  I've got to be honest with you.  We used to wonder about it ourselves.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here they go again.  We were talking about this just earlier, too.  What do you guys call it when some show does something that's awful and kind of ruins the flow of the show throughout a few seasons?  I was like, we would call it Jump the Shark.  Right.  What do we call it?  Do you actually call it episode 60? 
[00:18:00]  Something like that?  No, we call it Jump the Shark.  Jump the Shark.  Did you know at that point that maybe, ah.  There was a little undercurrent of eye rolling.  Yeah.  You know, among all of us.  And yet, the fact of the matter is, you know, it was fun.  We were getting to be outside.  We didn't have to be stuck on the stage, on stage 19.  I mean, you know, we were outdoors, and the thing got great ratings and all that stuff.  Yeah.  The first couple of seasons of Happy Days was so much different from the last few seasons, the first couple of seasons. 
[00:18:30]  It was done on film.  Yeah.  And just had more of that American graffiti, Love American style kind of look to it.  Yeah.  And when the decision was made to switch over to video, live audience thing, did that bother people?  Well, it always stayed on film, but it didn't bother people because it was so much more, I don't know, electric.  And we were competing with shows that were working with live audiences, and those shows had a kind of an energy. 
[00:19:00]  And the other style, although it was more comfortable for me because it was more like movies,  or even going back, more like the Andy Griffith Show, which was a one-camera show.  All right.  And I was the rookie.  I hadn't done any stage at all.  And everybody else, they were all stage veterans.  How were you the rookie when everybody, you know, you were in the business forever?  I was getting nauseous before, you know, every show for the first year that we did it that way.  But, you know, in retrospect, as a director, I was so glad that we did it because later it taught me so much more about comedy. 
[00:19:30]  Because when you really are dealing with an audience, you actually are hearing what gets a laugh, what doesn't, what's the timing,  how you can screw up a joke, you know, what makes, how you can intensify a laugh and things like that.  It really helped later when I started directing things like Night Shift and Splash and others to know that.  Yeah, sometimes it's just an energy breather, it's just, it's a lean, there's just sometimes something that will propel a laugh forward that you can't write.  There's like a kind of a, yeah, there's a rhythm to it and there's sort of an algebra. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, the comedy writers are fantastic, the way they'll break down a thing and, you know, you change a syllable and suddenly it gets a laugh.  Yeah, then it's funny.  Yeah, yeah.  You put the funny word at the end of the sentence instead of in the middle so you don't step all over it.  And Gary Marshall was brilliant.  He was like this great teacher because we do the run-throughs, do the run-throughs.  He was a creator of the show and he's also a great director now, but then he was sort of one of the kings of television.  And he'd come in and we've done the show and suddenly he would give like eight notes. 
[00:20:30]  And they'd be little things like that, change a word, why don't you lean in, take a pause.  And every time, suddenly that new fix would just make it a joke, make it a laugh, get a laugh.  He was kind of, you know, a genius at him.  How did you avoid the obvious pitfalls of child stardom and keep your career going and then get into directing?  I mean, it's one of those things where it's very rare that you do see that from a child star, especially from the era where a lot of people had no money afterwards. 
[00:21:00]  There wasn't as many laws in place.  You know, it's luck.  I mean, first of all, I was already at that point where the money was put aside.  But my folks were great and did put the money aside.  So when I turned 18, you know, I was in good shape from Andy Griffith's show and all that.  And you knew you wanted to go into directing pretty early on.  I knew really early.  I knew really early.  By the time, I used to even talk about it when I was like eight or nine.  But by the time I was 14 or 15, I was thinking about it every day.  Telling Andy Griffith he should stand over here. 
[00:21:30]  I think it would be better if Barney comes in off the left.  You know, the thing is about that show is that the environment was unbelievably creative and it was fun.  And yet, because of Andy, who set this tone all eight years, never getting lazy about it, it was really about doing something for the audience.  Let's make this as good as it can be.  And nobody would ever walk through it.  Nobody would ever be allowed to be.  And yet, there was a lot of laughter on the set. 
[00:22:00]  And as a director, one of the reasons I like working with Tom Hanks so much is he has that understanding, has that quality of, you know, we don't have to make this an agonizing experience.  We can have a lot of laughs.  And yet, you know, we're here for one reason.  And we're, you know, we're trying to achieve some level of excellence.  When you killed that bird.  I know.  That's a...  And, yeah, yeah.  And then had to nurse the little baby birds.  I actually bumped into that episode.  Did you?  And watched it about a couple of months ago. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  How is that for you watching?  Because all I can equate that to is watching home movies of when you're a little kid.  You know, but, I mean, this was seen by everybody.  What do you feel when you're watching those?  Well, two things happen.  First of all, it is like home movies.  Because I remember...  Do you critique yourself also?  And that's part two.  Really?  I wind up critiquing it.  At such a young age, and now you still look back and go, ah, what a dummy.  I could have done this.  Yeah.  But it was, you know, it was just a great jumping off place. 
[00:23:00]  Absolutely, yeah.  And, you know, it used to bother me.  People would say, hey, Opie, hey, Richie, or Eddie Murphy, hey, Opie Cunningham, or whatever.  And now I just view it as this great nickname.  And, you know, of course, as a director, I've been able to achieve the things that I wanted to achieve.  Yeah, you transcended that whole thing where, you know, some people have to do that for the rest of their life.  And they're, you know, working in parking garages or something.  You're, you know, obviously a name director. 
[00:23:30]  You've made a few films I think we've seen.  Frost Nixon.  Frost Nixon.  Thank you.  Blew me away.  Yeah, thank you.  Did you see Frost Nixon?  No, I haven't seen that yet.  I didn't know what to expect.  I'm like, yeah, it's kind of a documentary type thing.  It was amazing how good it was.  It was good.  It was been a great two years because I was working on Frost Nixon and Angels and Demons kind of simultaneously, preparing them both.  And I shot Frost Nixon, did a little editing, then went and shot Angels and Demons, then finished up Frost Nixon and put it out while I was editing.  So they're two totally different movies because Angels and Demons has all this action, these big sort of violent set pieces. 
[00:24:00]  They're really intense.  I mean, it's quite different from Da Vinci Code in that way in that this is really about Jeopardy and, you know, a ticking bomb.  And as a director, I'd never really made a film that was that intense and sustained it for that long.  So maybe a little like Backdraft in some ways, but, you know, you and Tom Hanks must be on a level now where you can just get together and work without having to really even talk to each other.  You know, it's always kind of been like that. 
[00:24:30]  And maybe because we both came out of TV, maybe it's just a similar sensibility.  But going back on Splash, I remember thinking, you know, I'm a couple of years older than Tom, but I was a veteran compared to Tom at that point.  I remember thinking, look how relaxed this guy is.  Look how creative he is.  And then when I worked with him on Apollo 13, I saw that he was all that and yet he'd reached this other level, which is what gives him so much power as a dramatic actor, which is he's not just entertaining. 
[00:25:00]  He's engrossing, even when he's not talking, he's like taking you, the audience, on a story.  And now with Da Vinci Code and now Angels and Demons, it's a whole other different kind of movie.  It's a different kind of character.  And I really like what he's doing with that Robert Langdon character from Da Vinci Code to Angels and Demons.  It's kind of like he's taking charge of the movie version of that character.  And it's really fun for me as a director and also as his friend to just sort of see how brilliant he is and how, you know, how smart he is about what he does. 
[00:25:30]  And yet he's having laughs and enjoying himself.  He's one of these actors that kind of got past the comedic actor thing, which obviously and amazingly, he brings that in even into serious roles.  Yeah, when you see him in Saving Private Ryan, a horrific movie, yet that humor that he has really comes through in whatever he does.  You can tell he's genuinely a funny guy.  Oh, well, he genuinely is. 
[00:26:00]  And I think, you know, and he was able to get a lot more humor into this latest, this one with Angels and Demons.  But again, a lot of that has to do with the style of the story because it's flowing.  It's a little more chaotic.  It's a little more intense.  And so for him to come in with a good line once in a while really eases the tension and it's very entertaining.  Can I ask something for the readers out there?  Now, Angels and Demons was the first Dan Brown book.  So how did you make it into a sequel when it probably should have been a prequel?  Well, there –  Maybe a little technical question, but – 
[00:26:30]  No, it was – first of all, as many millions of people who've read both Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons –  We all read Da Vinci Code first and then went, wait a minute, this guy had another book.  So for them it was almost like a sequel already in my mind.  And also even though a lot of people have read it, millions more have seen the movies.  And so I thought, you know, for them it was important to do it this way.  Also, Da Vinci Code cinematically is about a sort of a philosophical idea. 
[00:27:00]  It's about its controversy.  It deals a lot with the past.  It necessitated a lot of conversation and explanation in order to tell the story.  And it was sort of a – it was that first and kind of the mystery thriller second.  It's reversed in this one.  Oh, okay.  And it's a much more violent, intense, dangerous situation that Langdon is coming into.  And I felt like that it was better to have established the character in the other movie and now throw him into an even more intense situation in this one. 
[00:27:30]  And so for movie audiences and also for Tom to play the part, you know, it makes more sense to follow that story with this more intense one.  I'm looking forward to one other question.  Now, the church is finally off your back with this movie, right?  Because for a while there – we have Bill Donahue on our show from time to time.  And I get frustrated with the guy because he came out against you.  And then I go, well, Bill, have you seen the movie?  And he goes, ah!  I know.  And he does it all the time because he did it with a few other projects he had problems with. 
[00:28:00]  And our first question with the guy is, well, did you see the movie that you have a problem with?  And he goes, I don't know.  I'm not going to be bothered with that.  I'm like, but you're all over the press talking about it.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  Well, you know, look, that's my frustration as well.  See, I hope he's thinking like that.  Well, it's common sense, isn't it?  I hope he's a common sense kind of a guy.  You just don't succeed at the same rate. 
[00:28:30]  But then the church saw the movie, I guess, just to help this along a little bit.  And now they're okay with the movie.  Yeah, I think it's fun.  I think it's fun.  And look, hey, you know, look, intrigues at the Vatican, even, you know, violence, murders, assaults from outside and within.  You know, if you're at the Vatican bookstore, with this one guy pointed out to me, you can read all about it.  I mean, it's in their history.  It's a part.  I mean, you know, it's it's it's a it's it's it's an amazing institution. 
[00:29:00]  They've done so much good.  But any institution is is going to, you know, occasionally be compromised or, you know, you know, human beings come into play with all those weaknesses.  So they've had all those kinds of dramas.  What Dan Brown does is he sort of draws on on on these possibilities and then he creates a work of fiction.  And, you know, and that's what Angels and Demons is.  And this even more than Da Vinci Code is is is is is really about the ride that the audience. 
[00:29:30]  I can't wait to see it.  I think you'll like I'm really excited to start showing it to audiences.  Yeah.  What is it like to not win an Oscar, like when you're nominated for something and like you believe in it, it's like, you know, that being nominated is such an honor.  But I always wonder, what are they like?  What are you thinking when you're sitting there and like they mention the other name?  It's like, all right, you've been but is like is it a tremendous letdown or do you kind of a feeling like I think they're going to take it?  Well, I've had different experiences with with Apollo 13, which which was sort of neck and neck with with Braveheart.  My favorite, by the way, Apollo 13. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, thank you.  I was very proud of it.  And we were nominated for Best Picture.  And we started winning some of the awards leading up to it.  And Brian Grazer and I were sort of sitting there side by side and we felt like, well, this is it.  And a lot of the pundits had had said we were going to get it.  And Braveheart won.  And so for us, that was one of those that was one of those moments where I said to Brian, well, this is like somebody kicked a field goal to beat you with one second left in the game, you know.  And and even though I love I loved Braveheart, but I was very proud of Apollo 13. 
[00:30:30]  We won with Beautiful Mind.  And that was thrilling.  And with Frost Nixon, you know, we we were thrilled to be nominated.  We didn't I don't think Brian or either one really expected to win.  Slumdog Millionaire was a great movie.  We loved it.  It had a lot of momentum.  And clearly, you know, it was it was the favorite.  And still, you're sitting there and you're just you just you know, upsets happen in those award shows.  And it'd be thrilling to get to the microphone and talk about your movie and get an award.  I guess it's easier once you've won a couple, too. 
[00:31:00]  Like, you know, that would be nice.  It's probably a little easier to follow.  It's nice.  When you're there, you'd like to get it.  Yeah.  Is Clint in the new movie at all?  No, my dad is.  Oh, my dad is in it.  And he plays an American cardinal.  The whole thing takes place during Conclave, during that time when they lock all the cardinals in and they're trying to vote for a new pope.  Right.  Because it begins our film begins with the death of a pope.  And and, you know, they never let cameras in there.  And and but it's it's pretty well documented. 
[00:31:30]  And I I took pains to try to be as authentic and detailed about that as the capsule going to the moon.  Right.  But it was really interesting.  Anyway, my dad got to play, you know, one of the American cardinals there.  And it was it was it was a great experience.  Was there a was there a competition between you and Clint growing up?  Because he had, you know, General Ben, his own pretty much his own vehicle.  You had Andy Griffith show, but you were kind of, you know, it was Andy's show.  One time, one year for one week. 
[00:32:00]  And I think Andy Griffith was first and General Ben was second in the ratings.  And that was pretty great.  I remember really appreciating that.  But there's a five year spread between us.  And we've always been close.  And and, you know, the in all honesty, the business has never gotten in the way of that.  And we don't talk about it too much.  But but Clint's got a, you know, a great life, works all the time.  I would just constantly go to him.  It's Tranya. 
[00:32:30]  Well, he's in Star Trek episode.  Jesus.  He's he's kind of I might get this wrong, but I think he's in an upcoming episode of Fringe.  If you like that, you might want to see this episode of Fringe because he's really I know we're running out of time.  But Arrested Development, I got to just mention, that's just an amazing show.  Thanks.  It's an amazing show that I discovered when it came out on DVD.  Critics loved it.  And then for some reason, you know, sometimes I'll upset it before or Greg, if I don't want to. 
[00:33:00]  It's like too weird for me.  Sometimes the shows are too smart and too clever for the majority of the people watching television, I think.  Well, it was also a kind of a a a breakthrough stylistically in terms of what a half hour TV comedy could look like and sound like.  Yeah.  It looked totally different.  And, you know, now there's now there's the office and 30 Rock.  I didn't even realize that.  You know, it started with the Arrested Development.  Right.  That's what I'm getting at.  But Mitch Hurwitz, the creator of the show, is working on a screenplay along with a guy, Jim Vallée. 
[00:33:30]  And, you know, Fox Searchlight really wants to make a movie of it.  And so I'm excited because it's, you know, another another announcer gig for me.  Yeah.  You're not going to be involved with the creative process, though, of the movie?  Well, a little bit.  But it really that became, you know, Mitch's Mitch's baby.  And, you know, I mean, I it's it's I was involved early on with the show creatively.  And then soon it just completely, you know, he he he really owns it. 
[00:34:00]  He's a brilliant guy.  He's he would also direct this.  And so, you know, he's he's writing as we speak.  I loved how it was uncredited.  Yeah, I was about to say that.  It's like if everyone in the world doesn't know Ron Howard's voice.  Why would you be uncredited?  Why would you be uncredited?  What is that?  I don't know what that means.  It's almost silly for him to be credited because you knew it was Ron Howard's voice.  Yeah.  And I don't mean to be naive.  I mean, I'm an actor. 
[00:34:30]  It was sort of an accident because in the beginning I did the narration as just a temp, a temp thing.  And we expected to get somebody else.  And and then they liked the narration and it tested well and Mitch liked it.  And he asked if I would do it.  And and I hadn't been credited on the pilot.  And and then there was a lot of people sort of saying, is that Ron Howard's voice?  Is it not?  I don't know.  So we just thought going into the new season, it'd be more interesting to do it that way. 
[00:35:00]  And and so we just kept it that way.  It's kind of a statement how famous you are, too, and how well known you are.  So you're like, no need for credit to recognize Ron Howard's voice.  Can I can I pitch a future project for you, Ron?  Sure.  I'll play a documentary on all the Opie's out there.  Yeah, there must be some.  Hey, do you know where the name came from, by the way?  No idea.  I know where mine came from.  It was you.  Andy, everybody always said, well, is it short for something?  And he said, no, when he was a kid in North Carolina and it was it was before before TV, 
[00:35:30]  there was radio, but they were in a small town.  And the biggest thing that would happen is once in a while a circus would come through or a carnival.  But the other thing is he's traveling music shows.  And there was a band leader named Opie Opie something who had this, you know, this band that he would come through.  Andy loved music, would always see the show and always remember that name.  And so when they were looking for the name of his son, it's like finding out something about your family tree. 
[00:36:00]  So some alcoholic that would travel.  But you won't you won't like shave your head in sympathy with me.  If you put me in it, I'll do whatever you want.  I'll say goodbye to these two guys in a second.  I got to say, I met Ron on the streets.  I mean, we get starstruck every once in a while, but I was out of my freaking mind.  And I don't know if you remember, but then I ran home to get a camera.  I'm like, what am I doing?  And my wife, she wasn't my wife at the time. 
[00:36:30]  I'm like, I got to go back.  I got to get a picture.  And I never do that.  Well, I like bumping into you.  Did I tell you what happened in that Starbucks?  I was recognized.  We were both in the Starbucks.  I know these guys have heard the story.  Two big stars.  No, I'm not even going there, but I'm in the Starbucks.  It's really early.  And I get recognized going, I can't believe, Opie, you're in the Starbucks.  And I go, do you understand how surreal this is?  You're saying that as the guy I'm named after is right over there putting whatever he's putting in his coffee. 
[00:37:00]  And then I blew that guy off to go talk to you.  And then Ron blew you off.  Oh, yes.  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  Well, whatever.  It was one of those moments I'll never forget.  It was awesome.  It was fun.  I enjoyed it, too.  Hey, when you hear something like the Christian Bale meltdown, which happens, I'm sure, with actors.  Does stuff like that kind of happen, maybe not to that level, but commonly on sets where it just never gets recorded or where people just kind of freak on each other a little bit?  Well, that was pretty intense.  My daughter, Bryce, was in that scene with him.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, I forgot.  And so I heard all about it way before it ever broke. 
[00:37:30]  And it was uncomfortable for her, and she was surprised because that's not who he is.  So clearly he was in an intense scene.  And when I heard the circumstances, even from Bryce, of why he blew, frankly, I understood it.  Yeah.  Because emotionally you're doing something like that.  And if you feel like that, you know, even somebody you respect, the cinematographer, is doing something that's preventing you from getting, from, you know, the moment that, you know, you're kind of been building your character to, you're going to lose your temper. 
[00:38:00]  Now, you know, he went overboard, and I'm sure he regrets that, and, but, you know, so those kind of tirades, I probably haven't heard anything that went on and on and on like that before.  But people blow up all the time.  It's, you know, it's like probably in a dugout or in the locker room.  It's very intense, you know, and people are giving everything they've got.  And let's face it, it's, you know, it's not the kind of career that draws people who are, you know, all emotionally stable.  Emotionally stable, okay. 
[00:38:30]  Ron's got to go, man.  Yeah, we got to respect his time.  I mean, this was great, Ron.  And now, Academy Award winning director Ron Howard getting high.  Dude, you are so mad.  Dude, dude.  Dude, don't watch TV. 
[00:39:00]  There's a wonderful and exciting world out there.  We discovered that we don't need TV to entertain us.  He said, ain't up.  Have you guys heard a word I've said?  Yeah.  Ain't up.  What the fuck was I even saying?  What was it like, man, when you were on that TV show?  Well, to think. 
[00:39:30]  Ron.  Man, we should hang out more.  Cool.  Yeah.  That was Academy Award winning director Ron Howard getting high.  If you're listening to the worst of 2009.  Suck my tennis cops so far on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, 2009 thus far. 
[00:40:00]  I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  You're E-Rock and that's your fiance.  Walking the hallways.  All right, so let's get into this.  Hey, E-Rock, you know Bob Kelly's a blithering idiot.  Yes, and this couldn't have been portrayed better had Jim not designed this bit.  It's where Bob Kelly goes on a rant.  Oh.  He sounds intelligent, tries to prove a point, but he falls to pieces as soon as you ask him a follow-up question.  It's like he goes home and figures out his theories in advance. 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  Like he sits alone in a room and he's got this theory, but the minute you insert a question or comment in, he just falls to mind.  Because it's not what he wrote down.  No, he doesn't know where to go with it.  And, well, we just described this bit to a T.  Yes.  So you'll hear it exactly how we described it on the worst of 2009 so far for The Opie and Anthony Show.  Which is this show.  Right now.  You're listening to the worst.  Holy shit.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, fuck it. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, fuck it.  Yes, that's your answer.  That's your answer to everything.  A riot with the Air Force One scare.  Shut up.  No, no, no.  It's the Scare Force One.  Scare Force One, they called it.  In their time of need.  Yeah.  Because if that doesn't rhyme, if they don't give it a hokey thing, we're not going to get it.  God, what a bunch of faggots we are in this country.  We get it.  They should have let someone know they didn't.  Move on.  Joey Vegas.  We've got to show the footage.  Yeah, it's...  They're showing I Am Legend footage up there.  Do you see that?  Oh, my God.  What is that?  I Am Legend?  Why are they showing I Am Legend footage?  Because they're assholes. 
[00:41:30]  This is what it's going to...  This is what the fagg flu is going to do.  Now they're scaring other people.  Why the fuck would they do that?  Because they're dumb.  All right.  But they're just showing that to scare people.  They're trying to start a riot.  Why don't they just show shit from, like, Independence Day and say it happens?  There's going to be a bunch of Amway people out there.  It's a big riot.  You know what, dude?  The whole thing's a scam, dude.  Here we go.  A pre-planned speech that can handle no interruptions.  Dude, I figured it out. 
[00:42:00]  It's Air Force One.  Yeah, dude.  They know they're doing that, dude.  They don't care.  They tell the mayor, but his whole thing...  Why, Bob?  Damn, I'm just going to keep talking because one question fucks me up.  Fucking...  What a blithering idiot.  Bob is a blithering idiot.  One question fucking wrecks him.  Could you say blithering one more time?  What's that?  I just need to hear blithering.  That's what he is.  He's a blithering idiot. 
[00:42:30]  That's what Bob does.  He fucking rambles on.  I think the whole time he talks, Dane is just on a PSP, fucking politely not listening.  You know what, Dane?  The whole thing's fucked up.  You're going to go to court.  You're going to get your stuff back.  Dude!  How do you think?  I don't know, dude.  I just thought out my speech.  No interaction with people.  Can't ask him a question about it.  You can't.  It fucking stops him in his tracks.  Bob's a fucking...  He's a yammering ninny.  Are you trying to say he blithers too much? 
[00:43:00]  He fucking can't stop.  That fucking dumb, juicy-lipped hole in the middle of his face just opens up and shit  tumbles out of it.  Bob is as stupid as you can possibly be and still walk on two fucking legs.  I'm telling you, dude.  The whole thing.  They're going to trace it.  But what about the play?  They're like, who's going to cross?  Hey, you know what, dude?  You know what, dude?  He's just fucking...  He has no idea.  That's his home base.  Dude. 
[00:43:30]  Just centers him.  The play...  Because they got that thing, dude.  It's all worked out, man.  You know what, dude?  They got two planes.  The mayor knew.  They want people to leave.  It's the whole thing, dude.  But why would they do that?  Well, hey, yeah, yeah.  He just stops talking like when you unplug a machine.  Hey, yeah.  He just runs out of gas immediately.  Are you saying you can throw him off easy?  That dumb motherfucker...  Try and listen to him talk politics is a fucking...  It's like a day at the movies.  Ask him anything about politics. 
[00:44:00]  What do you think about politics?  Oh, fuck, dude.  The taxes are going to go up, dude.  It's all they're going to do is try to keep on fucking you with your taxes going up.  How much of yours is going to go up?  Yeah, yeah.  He just freezes and makes sense.  Oh, Jesus.  Bobby, what about the prisoners there in Guantanamo?  Oh, do you know what, dude?  I say waterboard.  What are we supposed to do?  Not waterboard anybody?  I don't understand.  Did you hear, though, that there were some people that knew about it? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  That's blithering, all right.  Oh, he is.  He's a goddamn fool.  Holy shit.  I love making fun of Bobby.  I can't stop.  My face hurts.  He looks like mini-me.  Now that he lost weight with that stupid bald head.  I'm obsessed with decapitating him.  Did you see his Twitter?  And ask Bob Kelly about the swine flu, will you, please? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, what about that swine flu there, Bob?  The whole thing's a scam.  First of all, they named it after me.  Second of all.  Dude, there's no such thing.  I eat pigs.  But in Mexico, there are dead people.  Hey, but in Mexico, yeah!  Fucking Jimmy.  Fucking Jimmy.  The road hurts. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God.  Let's not drop that bit.  Let's bring that bit back.  Why can't they have a character as good as that on SNL, man?  That would be perfect.  Just make him the White House correspondent.  Just ask him a question.  Yeah, blithering Bob.  So I love that we have something new on him now that he isn't fat.  Oh, I know.  It's just...  Now that he's not fat.  He can just be a blithering idiot.  He's got to find that perfect balance of sort of out of shape and not quite stupid. 
[00:46:00]  And you got one more?  Dad, the thing is, taxes are going to go up and they're going to keep throwing in all  their own shit.  Everybody got to get their own shit in there.  Nobody cares about what's going on for everything.  So what about a set flat tax?  Yeah, but I...  Oh, fucking A, man.  He just freezes.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wait.  What happened? 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  I hope the phone ain't ringing.  He freezes like the Tin Man when he gets water thrown on him.  Hello?  No, you're just a mean...  I don't know if this show helps me or hurts me.  Are you listening, Bobby?  I think this show actually helps me not sell tickets.  Who would come see a guy that goes,  Dude, you know, Obama?  You're just a mean person.  Well, dude, it's not about...  Dude, you don't do it good. 
[00:47:00]  Ask him.  I don't do me good?  No.  It's not about you on stage.  It's just off stage.  On stage, you're fine.  It's off stage where you should be shot.  You think these assholes...  Yes, I'm sorry.  Bob, show them your intelligence.  Talk about politics.  What do you want to know?  I just can't randomly throw my intelligence out on the fucking table.  Of course not.  Who would see it?  Well, how about...  All right, how about something that's in the news?  What do you got on the swine flu?  Well, actually, the swine flu is not that big of a deal, to be honest with you. 
[00:47:30]  Most diseases sometimes...  How many people have come down with it?  Well, 60 have died in Mexico.  Nobody's died in America.  More than 60 have died.  He has no idea.  You're trying to sound smart.  You're trying too hard.  No, no, absolutely.  More than 60 have died.  Just be quiet.  You'll hear him clicking, Googling.  No one's died in America now, he says.  Yeah, they have in Texas and Dallas.  Yeah.  It's in Vancouver, too. 
[00:48:00]  It's infected...  How many people in Mexico have died?  I like how he's really trying to keep his voice low right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, what's going on here?  Let me tell you about the swine flu.  The swine flu.  He'll get mad.  All right, dude.  When Bob rehearses at home, here's what will happen.  He'll hold in a shit while sipping a coffee and smoking a cigarette,  and the dogs just fucking feign interest.  Poor Diva and Kelby have to listen to him.  You know what, dude?  I'm telling you, you're going to go to court.  You're going to get all your shit back.  There's not going to be any problems. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, but do you think that will be...  Why don't you...  It's just, you know, it just hurts my feelings.  Dad, dude, you know what the problem is, dude?  You're being too smarmy.  You're getting all caught up in your thing.  Smarmy.  How am I being smarmy?  Because you're just...  I don't like that you added a new thing to it, you fucking asshole.  It's brand new and hysterical.  It sure is. 
[00:49:00]  Mwah.  I don't like to do that.  No, but that's you running out of steam talking.  You just stop in mid-sentence.  Like, you just freeze with your hands up in the air.  I'm not painting you well, Bob.  I have nothing bad to say about you, Jim, as a human being on and off stage.  You're just an amazing...  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:49:30]  You're listening to the worst of the worst of 2009 so far.  On the virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  Hi, everyone.  Hi.  And welcome back to the show.  Don't talk over me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's primetime Sam Roberts here.  Hi, Sam.  What was that?  That's one, Sam.  Along with E-Rock.  And this is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2009 so far.  All the most memorable things to happen in 2009. 
[00:50:00]  And E-Rock, this is one of the things I remember best because I was a part of it.  It was the time I chopped you live in studio.  Ah, yes.  This was humiliating for both of us.  Mainly for you.  I was pretty much in the clear.  I just slapped you.  Dead center in the chest.  And left a massive hand.  Wow, we're talking too much about it.  Is there a motorboat involved with this one?  Oh, maybe.  Oh, maybe it is humiliating for both of us. 
[00:50:30]  Well, let's find out, along with the audience, on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of 2009 thus far.  I think Travis has a photo of this.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  I actually felt retarded.  Like, really retarded.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We kind of gave the show to the listeners today.  But this guy, he's got a good point.  Jordan from Pittsburgh.  He's calling us out.  He writes, if it's our show truly, I want someone to open hand slap E-Rock's man tits just so I can laugh. 
[00:51:00]  Now, if we don't do this, that means it's not really the listener's show today.  It's their show.  E-Rock?  Anybody out there that is even...  We were talking about you.  I know.  All right.  Well, get on mic.  Would you allow somebody to open hand slap your man tits?  I guess so.  It is their show today.  I guess so.  For the listeners, yes.  All right.  Who wants to do it?  Jimmy, can you do it? 
[00:51:30]  No.  I think a listener.  Wow.  I don't know.  Well, it is the listener's show.  Well, then you have a listener actually slap E-Rock's man tits.  Yeah.  Who would really want to slap your man tits?  Who doesn't like you on staff?  Would you imagine they're E-Rock?  Let's be honest.  How about Sam?  Everybody.  Who doesn't like it?  Maybe Sam comes in right at the...  I'm just walking in.  I...  No, he's got the camera.  Sam, you kind of like E-Rock?  Yeah, I pretend not to.  You pretend not to, but you actually like him? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I know there's some of that that does go on.  Who doesn't like you on staff?  Would you imagine, E-Rock?  Hmm.  Whose foot have you stepped on?  Probably, well, lately, probably Poe.  Well, he's not here.  Oh, he's not here.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Well, Danny would do it, but Danny's not here either.  Right?  Yeah, Danny would do it in a second.  Now it's getting crazy, the listener's show.  I want Steve to blow Jimmy.  Come on, we're going with this a little bit, but... 
[00:52:30]  Jimmy volunteers.  You know he'll do it good.  E-Rock?  Who doesn't like you?  Travis?  I'd imagine Travis doesn't like you.  You want to do it, Travis?  He's coming.  Travis.  What?  We got, like...  I'll do it, but I won't do it.  No offense, but you guys are fucking, like, not really the biggest, bulkiest guys...  I disagree.  ...that we can find.  Sam and I are very good looking.  How do you open hand-slap man tits, by the way?  Wait, it's like a nature boy chop.  I better do this.  It's like a Ric Flair chop. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, you know how to do it?  Yeah, I know how to do it.  I better do this.  But could E-Rock make it more humiliating and kind of squish them together?  I know that's a little different than how the WWE does it, but...  So he would squish his man tits together.  And then where does the slap actually take place?  Is it in the cleavage?  Well...  Is it underneath his breast?  He has to hold it from the bottom and push them together.  I think if E-Rock, like, pushes way from the sides to give plenty...  Like this, look.  Yeah, he'll have huge tits.  Give Sam a nice target, all right? 
[00:53:30]  And then you're hitting the cleavage?  Yeah, you hit the cleavage, and then the goal would be to get, like, a red handprint.  But then when he lets go, it's going to look like two halves, like one half of a hand,  and the other half, and it'll be separated by his chest meat.  Yeah, we could write best-on-one thing.  Yes, like a Mad Magazine fold-over rear page.  Am I right?  Get up, E-Rock.  It is their show today, and this is what they want.  Assholes.  Yep.  All right. 
[00:54:00]  John from Utah.  Stop with listener content.  We admit we're not as funny.  Ah!  Finally.  Well, this is good right here.  You got it, E-Rock?  Let's get a little focus.  E-Rock's got little 12-year-old boobs.  Those big nipples.  They're little buds.  Oh, my God.  You got little training bra boobs.  He has butting breasts.  What?  Why would that be on?  E-Rock's tits would look like the cover of the Blind Faith album. 
[00:54:30]  That's a reference.  Nice.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You got a...  Is he doing it right?  No, you got a little...  No, I think he's got to go all the way from the side.  He can't squish his boobs together.  But they're very man-booby.  How about you just slap without squishing them together because you can hurt them more that  way.  No offense, Eric.  No, I think...  All right.  Sam, you know what you're doing?  You ought to squish them a little bit. 
[00:55:00]  Hold on.  Anthony, you should squish them.  Squish them together.  Let's see.  What?  You should squish them together.  Anthony, you should squish them together.  So squish them.  Is there room there?  Can you tape them?  Oh, my God.  Those are boobs.  Dude, that's hysterical.  You got, like, real boobs.  Yeah.  Wait.  It is audience participation here.  They would rather hear Sam do the motorboat.  That I don't know how to do. 
[00:55:30]  Fair enough.  Hey, the audience is cheering that.  I hear him cheering in the background a little bit.  What do you say, Sam?  No, because we got to get somebody...  For the radio.  Atta boy, Sam.  For the radio.  Sam's a good kid.  It's not gay if it's for the radio.  Exactly.  Don't cover up like some fucking...  Rape victim?  Like, yeah.  It's cool.  Or like some stripper between songs.  Yeah.  Like they got some kind of fucking morality.  Yeah.  I don't like this song.  Oh, could you eject this?  And they cover up.  Yeah.  What do you say there, Iraq? 
[00:56:00]  Would you let him motorboat you?  I'd rather just take the slap.  Iraq, why don't you let yourself go?  Like, is it the holiday?  Was it the holiday thing?  Or life, either one.  No, because he was like...  He was...  He lost so much weight, and then you just fucked it all up.  Yeah.  It happens.  All right.  I say we do the motorboat, Sam.  What if we do the motorboat followed by the slap?  That way all the listeners are happy.  Yeah, that's true.  Followed by the slap?  Yeah.  I'll wheel and deal with you. 
[00:56:30]  You do a good motorboat.  You get to do the karate chop slap thing.  Sure.  Why is Iraq laughing?  He's warming up.  Exactly.  How's it going to sound there, Sam?  Let me see your...  Way to get the gay out.  I was going to say, just keep telling yourself this is not gay.  This is not gay.  This is not gay.  Here goes Sam.  He's getting close to Iraq's moves. 
[00:57:00]  Iraq didn't like that.  What's wrong, Iraq?  It scared him.  He was frightened.  The vibrations.  It was frightened.  What happened?  Did it vibrate a little too much?  It was gross.  Really?  It was wet, Sam.  Oh, come on.  Fuck, Sam.  I spit a little.  Another man.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Just give Iraq a stage where that bull here can rage. 
[00:57:30]  Come on, champ.  If he looks like Lamont when they woke him up, he didn't do symptoms, then.  Here's, uh...  Now here's the slap.  It was the deal we made.  Iraq, you're prepared for this, right?  No, but...  Across his man boobs.  Here goes Sam.  Oh, fuck it!  Did it hurt?  Can that stop a heart?  Maybe we should, like, test drive some of this shit.  Nah, not an open hand.  Oh, wow.  Let me see. 
[00:58:00]  Please tell me what I'm saying.  Is it all red?  Wow, I think I see a handprint.  Wait, come under the light.  I want to see the handprint.  It's like a sunburn.  Holy shit!  Yes, Sam.  I can't see it, Iraq.  Look at that handprint.  Show the audience.  It's like hyper-colored skin.  Show the audience.  Go under the light.  I can't see it.  You should have done it on his stomach.  No, you can see it.  Oh, there's a fucking light.  Do you want one more?  Hey, Iraq, can he hit one of your stomachs?  I can't see it.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I can see the handprint.  You should put it on your stomach.  Yeah, let him do it on his belly. 
[00:58:30]  Well, you know, it's actually not on our show.  It's a listener's show.  Listeners are saying they want him to hit him in the belly like that.  Oh, wow.  That's rough.  The listeners.  Is there anything I can hit him in the face afterwards?  With your dick.  You have a handprint on your chest.  How'd that happen?  That's pretty good.  Exactly.  I wasn't looking where I was going.  Why, is it warm now?  It's like I'm having a breathing problem.  Don't say that.  No, no, I'm not. 
[00:59:00]  But you know when your lungs get really raw from...  Like if you're swimming in a pool or something and you inhale and...  Well, it's probably the reaction.

[02:04:30]  It's the worst  Of 2009 so far  As told by  The Opie and Anthony  Show  And uh  Eric  What happens  When you take  Two special guest  Comedians  Both named Jim  And both with  Deplorable habits  And put them  In the same room  Along with Jim Norton  Three Jims?  You have  Jim Florentine  And Jim Jeffries  Talking about  Drunk sex  Well primetime Sam Roberts  I would have to say  That could be a paradox  Well it's not a paradox 
[02:05:00]  It's just they all  Happen to be named Jim  Which is a fairly  Common name  So that's not at all  A paradox  Then I would say  It would have to be  Ugly hysterical  Yes  It's just a bunch  Of funny guys  Telling funny jokes  And talking about  Debauchery  Debauchery  Drunken debauchery  Sex  Debauchery  Porno  Private parts  Degrading women  I'm just doing  Keywords to try  To get listenership up  Thesaurus  Thesaurus  Thesaurus  Thesaurus  Thesaurus  Thesaurus  Triceratops 
[02:05:30]  On the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  The worst of 2009  So far  You're listening  To the worst  It sucks a pile of cock  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Oh shit  Oh my god  It's an easy one today  Everyone just  During the break  A lot of yapping  I love it  Yeah  I think there were  Five different conversations  Going on  During the break  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Jim Jeffries  Jim Florentine  A lot of Jim's in today 
[02:06:00]  All time I say Jim  Yeah  Should be a theme  We should have like  Jim Thursday  Yeah  Call it the gym workout  Sure  Now that's  Oh wow  The gym workout  Mornings  Pew pew pew  Oh that's great  That's terrible  Mornings at the gym  This is creepily bad  I just did a show  Gym radio  I don't even want to say where  But I just did a morning show  Somewhere in another market  And it was free for all Fridays  Oh yeah  What happens on free for all Fridays  There was nothing going on 
[02:06:30]  I expected when I opened  The elevator doors  Like people going nuts  There was no free for all  Anywhere  I went in  We just talked  Ancient Rome  It was not free for all  Drinking  Vomiting  Having sex  Hacking people's limbs off  Nothing  Nothing  You gotta hate morning radio  I mean you've been fortunate  To do Howard's show  Our show  And then you go out there  And you have to deal with  Free for all Fridays  Free for all Fridays  It's just horrible  Isn't it  Yeah  It's something that's really bad  Did you ask any of the staff  What free for all Fridays meant 
[02:07:00]  They busted my balls  About coming on the show  They were like  We need five topics  You know  So you were on a plane recently  You know like that  Yeah  We want stuff from your act  They go look  I do 45 minutes of penis jokes  Can I say  They're like no  You can't  I go that's all I talk about  Is just taking care of myself  I've never understood  These radio guys  Where someone like  Florentine  Or Jeffries  Or Norton  You don't need to prepare  You just sit them down  And start yapping  But they do do that  It's the easiest thing to do  In radio 
[02:07:30]  It's a talk show  I was doing one  And they do that thing  Where they  Because I know I do  A lot of religious material  And they go  Hey so you're in that hotel  There's always a bible  In the bedside table  What's up with that  Do you ever read that  And you're like  Oh you want that joke do you  Oh no  And then I just said  Alright just say  That I'm single  I got a bunch of material  I could just talk about  On the radio  Fine  Because I want to sell seats  That's the bottom line  So  And then the producer comes out  And he's like  Well how is he going to get into this  That you're single  I go I have no idea  Yeah it's his job  How the hell do I know  I don't know 
[02:08:00]  How is he going to get into this  How is he going to get into this  He's like he likes this  That you're single  But how is he going to get into that  Are you kidding  I swear to god  I almost thought  I was getting messed with  I'm like alright  Somebody's punking me right now  Yeah  Do you have change of a five  Yeah I got a few singles  By the way  So what does your wife think about that  You don't have one  What  They're the worst  Ham handed wave  They're terrible  Unbelievable  That's why we  I mean we love the comedians  That come in on  And do our show 
[02:08:30]  But there was a time  We hated having comedians  On our show  We were able to turn this thing around  Because they would come in  And you would ask them  Something like  How's it going  Florentine or whatever  And the next thing you know  They're doing their act  Like how did that happen  We just want to do the hang  You know  Yeah how's it going  Well not as good as it's going  For George Bush  Yeah right  You said we like doing the hang  There was one comic  That would do his act  When he came in  And I believe he hung himself  Oh yeah  Doing the hang  Did he really 
[02:09:00]  I don't know  Was it Jenny  Did he hang  He shot himself  No he shot himself  Oh that's alright  I was thinking of the other guy  From the Family Feud  Oh Ray Combs  Yeah Ray Combs  Survey said  Survey said Brooks was here  Adios funny man  Was he the host of Family Feud was he  Yeah for 10 minutes  You wanted to say something on the air  About your parents  No no no no  What were you talking about  There was something else  No  Me and Anthony were talking about 
[02:09:30]  At the moment I've given up alcohol  For a couple of weeks  Just to drop a few pounds  And just so I can have a clear brain  That was the scream you heard from me  Yeah just to have a clear brain  For a couple of weeks  Before the special  And then I've been on the road  For two weeks  And I've picked up three times  And I  Have you ever had sex  Where you're sober  And they're drunk  I've never done this  In my whole life  It's like  It's like rape  Without the  Guilt  No not the guilt  Without the justification  Of being drunk 
[02:10:00]  Like there is  It's rape  Rape with the guilt  Because the whole time  They're passing in and out  Of consciousness  You're just pulling their hair up  Going  You're sure you're into this  Yeah  You're positive  Oh yeah  Okay  Put your head back down  It's rape without the charges  Without the charm  There is  There is  Something about that  When  If both  Both of you are drunk  And you're rolling around  There's this mutual  Alright  We're hammered  Kind of a thing  But if you're not drunk 
[02:10:30]  And that girl is ripped  It is just like  Ridiculous  Just get this over with  Shut up  Whatever  It's so awkward  What do sober people do  How do they meet each other  How do they get together  And how do they have sex  Yeah  Like the first time  You've got to be plastered  Right  Yeah  I would think so  You've got to have a few in you  Is it just me on this one  No  I'm right with you 
[02:11:00]  It does feel like  I've slipped into material  This is true  I'm right with you  And also there was this girl  In Cleveland  Who I went out with  On the Friday night  And I really liked her  And then I go out with her  On the Saturday night  And she wouldn't have sex  With me then  After two days together  And then she's like  Like I still want to see you  And I'm like  Well why aren't we having sex  And she goes  I don't think we're ready  And I'm like  I'm here for two days  This is as ready as we get  This is  This is the whole romance  Here it is  We've got to confine  Like on the Titanic  Sunk after two days 
[02:11:30]  How big a romance was that  Or a comedian  Two days is like  Two days is everything  Regular guys  In a relationship for a year  I had to kick her out  Of the hotel  And go  If you're not going to  Sleep with me  You have to leave  Because I'm an adult  And if you're not going  To have sex with me  Then I have no interest  In talking to you  I know it feels bad  But that's the reality  Of it  What's going to happen  In the morning  I'm going to chat to her more  I'm going to see  How crap she looks  In the morning  Without makeup  And not have sex with her  That's going to add  To your appeal  At least I would have  Had happy memories before 
[02:12:00]  What are you sleeping  In my bed for  We'll just sleep together  No  Unless I can wank  In the corner  I don't want you  In the room  Well that's the thing  When they always say  You know  Look nothing's going to happen  Like no  I don't want anything  To happen  Let's just crash  And that really annoys them  They're like  Wait a minute  Wait he doesn't want  To bang me  Look at you  You turn it around  Seven out of ten times  You're nailing them  Within ten minutes  Wow  Oh we started out  I don't want to have sex  We're just mad  I mean come on  We don't even know each other  Why do we do that  Let's just crash  And then next thing you know 
[02:12:30]  They're all over your mule  Do you guys' comics  Do the same thing  When you're in bed  With a girl in a hotel  Where she goes  I bet you go from town to town  And just have sex  With girls in different  Do you deny it  No  I denied it for years  I'm tired of denying it  And now I go  Yes  In every town  I try to  And you're just one of many  And it makes them feel small  But I like that  No  Or I just go  I bet you bang every comic  Every week  How do I know  You don't do that  No I don't  I go  Well you're here with me  And you just met me  Flartine is the turn it around 
[02:13:00]  Always  Always  Wow  Any kind of argument  With your chick  You just turn it around  Make it their fault  Yeah  And then they're crying  Go how did this get turned on me  You just banged my friend  And somehow it's my fault  Always  You brought her around  Exactly  You were looking  You threw the garbage out  You were out for a couple minutes  I don't know how to do that  You're a veteran  A road veteran  Girls always say that thing  They do say that sentence  Where they go  I don't normally do this  Yeah  Well I want some tramp 
[02:13:30]  Who normally does  I don't want an inexperienced person  Can you tell me that you have  I feel like I have enough diseases  To kill off yours  Well Jim  You always gotta walk them downstairs  Cause you never know  If these girls are gonna cry rape  At the hotel  After you're done with them  Go walk them out  And go to the front desk  And make sure you go over there  And say hey  I need a wake up call  For 6am  So the guy behind the desk  Sees you guys  The girl's not crying  Yeah  And then you crack a joke  Like hey  I go hey  Do I look like Brad Pitt 
[02:14:00]  And they're like  No  And I turn around  I go how about from this  I go just something stupid  And we're all  Ha ha ha ha ha  Yeah she thinks I'm Brad Pitt  Ha ha ha  And then she's laughing  And then she wants to press charge  Like hey  She was at the front desk  Look at the video  Who laughs  Who laughs  After they just got raped  Yeah  So you got that  You know what I mean  You put them off  You better laugh  She was very despondent  At the time  She did not know  What to do  And how to react  Some people react differently  To these situations  And she reacted 
[02:14:30]  To her horror  With laughter  I'm doing a very Jewish lawyer  Certainly are  When I was in New York  The first time I ever came  I picked up two girls  From Caroline's  And it's very  Very rare  You get the three thing  Going on right  But to convince them  To have a threesome  I had to keep on doing shots  And stuff like that  It turned out  They drank better than me  I was plastered  They took me back to the hotel  And they stole my video camera  So if you're out there girls  I'm still up for it  Even after the crime  Even after the crime 
[02:15:00]  Even after the crime  I forgive you  I was in on a  Jim Jeffries attempt  One day at the bar  We were both trying  And just failing miserably  I think we were a little  Too drunk  Halloween  Was that Halloween?

[02:18:00]  To this thing  And they're all in the hotel room  Before the pageant  And it said like  35 minutes before stage time  And the mother is crying  She's literally  Literally crying  Going  I bring the big hairspray  And I can't find it  Get your father  Get him  Because we need to  And she's pulling the sheets  Off the bed  And then she looks  Under the suitcase  And goes  I found it  Get over here  To the kid now  Spray her head  With the hairspray  Why wasn't the kid there? 
[02:18:30]  She was cowering in a corner  They had her out  Working the streets  Yeah  She was just trying to be a kid  Somewhere else  Just  The poor kids  Yeah for a second  Trying to be a child  Tina  Get the axe  Just that type of  Overbearing  Bitch  Well this guy swears  It's a whole  Positive thing  He swears  Oh really  I continuously go to  Weddings  And parties  And things  With girls  With whom I've met  At pageants  And I see what 
[02:19:00]  It's done for them  And you know  You have to sort of  Weigh out all of the pros  And all the cons  But when all is said  And done  I think pageants  Really are a positive journey  If you could trade places  With your mom for a day  What would you do?  Kill myself  She'd probably go shopping  If it's been on her credit card  I'd eat all the chocolate  Hidden under the couch  I'd drink out of the special bottle  She keeps over the fridge 
[02:19:30]  I'd keep a secret  I'd abuse another child  I'd let me play  Just burst into tears  These poor little bitches  What kind of problems  These are actually perfect though  These are the disturbed 
[02:20:00]  Kind of girls  I've always liked  And been attracted to  The ones that  After a while  Yeah yeah  I like girls with  Just like tons of baggage  And just  No dad  I like girls  I never  I don't think I've met  A girl's father  In years  You like them being  A complete mess  I just want  Daddy issues  I want everything  And after a while  You get sick of it  But initially  It just works perfectly  Yeah in the beginning  It's really cool  Because they're totally  Attached to you  Yeah they're all 
[02:20:30]  Left off  Yeah  It's just fantastic  They're a complete mess  They're messes  If I can't see  So bomb  It's a deal breaker  It's fantastic  When they gotta come to your door  With a bell hop  For all that baggage  Just bringing it all upstairs  Here you go  Here's my father  Oh fuck  Just log that  Take this steamer trunk  Of my mother was a bitch  And everything  Oh here's an uncle trunk  There's another one out here  And another one over here  The wildest in bed  Yeah yeah  That's what it is  Yeah  You gotta have the crazies 
[02:21:00]  And then  But the thing is  You could run into that landmine  Of bursting into tears  At any moment  Oh yeah exactly  And holidays are special too  Cause oh  Christmas  It's a happy occasion  Oh wait  That's the day dad left  Alright  Right off Christmas  But you have one minute  To cry  Next minute  To give me your treats  In a movie theater  You know what I mean  You don't know why  You're like  Alright I'm going with it  She was just crying  Ten minutes ago  It's like you just  Fell into girl interrupted  It's like they're trying  To suck daddy's love  Out of the bottom  Of the thing  All your problems

[02:22:00]  Hi  Hi  Were you one of the  Girls that went home  With Jeffries  After Caroline's last year  Yep me and my friend Jen  It is  She wears my camera  Oh we didn't take  Your camera  We took your CD  Someone  No someone took  My video camera  You're fessing up  To stealing something  So your credibility  Is shot  There was  There was  The Sony DVD  Camera  The ones that you  Put the little DVDs in  That wasn't there  In the morning  And I  Anyone could have  Taken advantage of me 
[02:22:30]  Mind you  How old are you  And your friend  I'm 26  15  Yeah  I met him at a pageant  How old is your friend  She's 14  No come on  How old is your friend  24  25  25  Okay so do you remember  These girls Jim  I don't  I remember the situation  Did you do anything  What Jim  I cannot remember  What the girls looked like  Jessica  I was plaster drunk  Jessica  We closed down Caroline's  Then we went to playwrights  I don't even know  What playwrights 
[02:23:00]  I'll tell you that's her  That playwrights  Is around the corner  No it's definitely her  Jessica walk us through it  Because Jeffries  Doesn't remember anything  Well he was on your show  It was like the week  He was on your show twice  And I thought he was hysterical  So I convinced my friend  To go to Caroline's  You're welcome by the way  No I'm saying you're welcome to Jim  Yeah you're always  You're welcome  We drank all day  We went there  Drank  This is so embarrassing  Okay  Met him  We met him  And he was really friendly  Asked us to say for a drink  So we did  And then we just kept drinking  Jim told us his life story 
[02:23:30]  Pretty much  Started singing show tunes  In Caroline's  And then  And then finally  The bartender was like  You guys gotta leave  We have to go  So we went to playwrights  But we pretty much drank  And chain smoked all night  Talking about his life story  It was pretty exciting  And wait  You went back to his room  So keep going  Let's go  Keep going  We went back to his room  The three of us  Yeah  And  Jim do you remember this  I can't remember  I'm a drunk  I'm a horrible  Horrible 
[02:24:00]  I can't remember  Anything past  Waking up  And not getting  I can't remember anything  Before waking up  And losing stuff  Wow  Pretty much  Jen and I decided  We live in Westchester  So we missed our last train  So I pretty much told Jen  Listen you have to give it up  We have somewhere to sleep tonight  Jen agreed  We went back to the apartment  No see that's not how I remember  Wow  Alright wait  Let her go  So Jen agrees  Keep going Jessica  So we go back to the hotel room  And  Sorry to disappoint guys  All three of us passed out drunk  So it wasn't just me 
[02:24:30]  You guys  You guys were as drunk as I was  I threw up in your sink  You threw up in the sink  This is  What a rock star  Holy crap man  You rule  This is a great story  Were you all naked in bed  Passed out  A little bit  I mean  You know  As much as we could be  Before we passed out drunk  If you would have died  If Jim would have died that night  He'd have been a legend  Yeah  Hold on  There's a little more left here  So you guys pass out  You're a bit naked  You don't really do much  With Jim Jeffries right 
[02:25:00]  No  So then like  Five o'clock rolls around  Jen becomes conscious again  Decides to go down to the  Front desk  Ask where the next train is  They were no help  So then  She came back to the room  At some point  I don't remember  She's like on the floor  I'm on the other side of the floor  We both end up  Jen and I end up  Spooning on the floor  To keep warm  The phone rings at six  To wake us up  And I pop up to answer  And Jim makes up  Screaming  And goes  Bloody hell  Why are you on my floor?  And how do you get this? 
[02:25:30]  You can't startle me  I'm not a good person  Remember when I told that story  About the break in  With the knife  And all that?  Ever since then  I'm a mess  If you try to wake me up  I'll scream  I will punch you  Yeah  I will just  Especially if I'm hung over  I'm horrible  Yeah  There was no punching  But he was pretty scared  So what about the stolen item?  What happened?  Yeah how did you get the item  Out of his room?  So okay  So then Jen and I  Haul us to the train station  A cab would not take us to the train  Because he thought we were hookers  He flat out and I  Driving us anywhere 
[02:26:00]  We get to  Close enough  Wait wait wait wait wait  You're out of the hotel  Which is fine  But how do you get the CDs?  I don't know  Jen okay apparently  So I get to Grand Central  Jen's like looking through her purse  I look in her purse  I'm like what is that?  She's like oh it's for you  It's a parting gift  I'm like excuse me?  She's like well I was looking through his drawers  Trying to find a train schedule  Or something  And I found these CDs  I thought he would  I think your friend stole my video camera  My video camera was gone  I've still got the CD  She took the camera 
[02:26:30]  The video camera was gone  Yeah your friend took it  She definitely would have told me  That she took it  Nah but maybe not  Now she wouldn't have told you  About the CDs  Because you saw them in the bag  What were the CDs?  That's true  That's true  I shaft her  What were on the CDs?  I just watched stand up  Oh was it?  The stand up  Stand up  They were awesome  Thank you  Well at least your comedy was awesome  Even though you passed out  Do you really think  That's the best review I've ever had  From a girl who didn't sleep with me  Who passed out in my bed  The other girl's got your camera 
[02:27:00]  It's so obvious  So obvious  Wait Jessica  Do you really think  That your friend was looking  Through his drawers  For a train schedule?  She was looking for money  Probably not  Oh my god  Jordan just got his pants pocket right?  Your friend's a thief  Yeah your friend's a thief  A little bit  A little bit  She was a fun girl though  Oh yeah she was a fun girl  Yeah she doesn't want to bang you  And she steals your CDs  She's great  Can't wait to hang with her  Hopefully the next parting gift  Will be chlamydia  Yeah but she won't bang you  She'll just throw it on you 
[02:27:30]  Well I won't bring Jen this time  She's moving to LA tomorrow  So she won't steal anything  Well tell Jen that I live in LA now  So if she wants to steal anything  She has your phone number  No she wasn't  To tell her the call  I'll tell her the call  When she gets there  Why is she going to LA?  So I can punch her in the head  To get my camera back  Better stuff to steal  She was hoping that would happen  She wants to be a filmmaker  With Jim's camera  She actually said 
[02:28:00]  Yeah I think  I'm picking up  Amateur filmmaking  Oh great she's a porn girl  You know that right  She's doing like  She so stole your camera dude  Yeah she's doing like  $500 porn videos  At least we know  That I was telling the truth  Yeah  That's pretty much  All right  The show's about  Getting to the bottom of things  Did Jim get naked at all?  Um no  He couldn't  What do you mean he couldn't?  What do you mean  It's not like an erection  Like no matter how  He couldn't get his pants off  This never happens to me  He couldn't walk  He couldn't walk 
[02:28:30]  We drank  We drank him  Under the table pretty much  Yeah they did do that  Wow  That's a good story  What a great opportunity  That was just like  Blown by alcohol  I know exactly  But the thing is  It's that little dance  You do with alcohol  If I didn't have any  If there was no alcohol involved  The opportunity wouldn't have  Come up  And then you can  You can drink past the opportunity  It's a fine line  As well as a fine line  I always said it  There's a graph that goes up  That things will get better  Your performance at certain things  Will get better as you drink  Especially bar related things  And picking up girls 
[02:29:00]  Is a bar related thing  Playing darts  Things like that  You'll get better  Better better better  And then instantly  Wham  The graph drops off  In one second  You play darts really well  Next thing you know  There's a family of four dead  Family of three would have been good  Why?  Because you only shoot  Three darts at a time  I just meant a drunk driving action  Yeah yeah yeah  Oh I thought you meant  Hit him in the head with darts  I would have thought  Hit him in the head with darts  I meant that you're playing  Darts really well  And it's a great night  And the drop off is 
[02:29:30]  Right  You're picking different color hair  Out of the grill  That's okay now  I got the old patent leather shoe  And the hair ribbon  I'm wondering how that happens  There's a lollipop and a Timex watch  Uh oh  Someone was holding hands  Jesus  Hey you're listening to Opie and Anthony  And if you're not listening to him  You might be deaf  Or retarded  And just have the radio on 
[02:30:00]  And just be looking at it  Staring and nothing's really computing in  But you wouldn't be offended by this  You can't hear me either  It's the worst of 2009  The worst  Hey what do you think  So far  On the virus  Sirius 197  XM 202  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show  The worst of 2009 so far  And here to give it to you  Is myself  Primetime Sam Roberts  And my buddy E-Rock  Who's standing in the chair over there  Both of us from  The Opie and Anthony show  So we're kind of experts in these fields 
[02:30:30]  And E-Rock  You and I are probably  The two utmost experts  As far as this next bit is concerned  Yes  And much like I am right now  In this material  I am enjoying  Some of the greatest treats  Of all time  What are you eating there?  What do you like?  Well this right here is a  What type of food?  I'm not saying it the way you want me to  I need some milk  What kind of food do you like?  Sam  But in this bit  This is not what your dad enjoys  No  Well my dad enjoys  Being the center of attention 
[02:31:00]  Yes  And so he called up  He started calling the Opie and Anthony show  Because I started telling stories about him  And how old fashioned he was  And so he started calling in  And explained to the guys  That a sardine and onion sandwich  With a pickle  A raw potato  And a glass of buttermilk  Were some of the greatest treats of all time  And what did he enjoy for dessert?  Taking saltine crackers  And crumbling them up into the buttermilk  And that was dessert  That's the sweet treat at the end 
[02:31:30]  How did you deal with this growing up?  Well I never ate any of it  I just watched him  And I was like  Like even when I was a small child  I was like  That is a weird thing to do  Yeah  And so  In their infinite wisdom  Opie, Anthony, and Jim decided  What better person  To prove whether or not  This was a great treat  Than E-Rock  Yes  And so  Currently my role on the show  Is eating  Yeah  Well  You brought that upon yourself  Let's be fair  It's either you or Steve C  And what does he really do here? 
[02:32:00]  Oh Steve's way out doing me  In the eating department  Yes but unfortunately  Not in the providing things  That make for good air department  Oh you mean content  Content  Okay  And we can fearlessly say this  Because he's not listening  And Steve  Yeah he's not listening  Because he doesn't provide content  No exactly  So they decided that  You would eat these things  And I guess  Should I ask you how it went?  Should we just play the clip?  I think you'll find out how it went  And I also think  This is the reason  That you don't eat normal food  Like regular people 
[02:32:30]  Because I said  This is what adults eat  There's no way I'm going near this  Yes  And also steak and rice  Well yeah  I don't eat that either  But I associate it all together I guess  Yeah  I think he damages  Your sense of taste and smell  Listen  I'm here to host a radio show  Not to be analyzed  Your dad ruined your childhood  If you would respect that  We could move on  It's the worst of 2009 so far  I know it is  The Opie and Anthony show  Sam and Iraq  And these are some of the greatest treats of all time  You can at least call me prime time  No  It's the worst of 2009 
[02:33:00]  The worst  So far  On the virus  Sirius 197  XM 202  Let's have Iraq try the greatest treats  Or some of the greatest treats of all time  Wait a minute  Look at it  It's all stacked up  What is that?  This is  The whole can of sardines  A whole can of sardines  Okay  Yeah  And then two  Slices of onion  That are about  A quarter inch thick  Yeah  They kind of fell apart a little bit  So I spread it out across 
[02:33:30]  Oh the pickles  Oh the pickles on the sandwich too  No the pickle  Is right here  With the raw potato  That's a little snack  On the side  Oh a little snack  And then  I waited  I didn't put the  Buttermilk concoction  Together yet  Oh no  Because you gotta eat  You know  The crackers  Out of the buttermilk  Right away  And that's  That's like dessert  That's dessert  And your dad would be proud  Of how you prepared  Some of the greatest treats  Of all time  This is  He would look at this sandwich  And say  Oh my goodness  What did I do  To deserve such a treat 
[02:34:00]  You're an ass  Here present  Some of the greatest treats  Of all time  With the pickle  And the raw potato  Okay  Get a little picture here  Before we move it over  To E-Rock  It's prison food  Look at it  It looks like  It belongs on a prison track  Yeah  Absolutely  You gonna eat that?  All right  E-Rock  You ready to try  Some of the greatest treats  Of all time?  We have some salt  For the potato  If you prefer with salt  Some people do  Some people do  I prefer pepper actually  What about your  Oh really? 
[02:34:30]  What about your dad?  He likes salt  Like salt on that potato  He pours salt on everything  Though he doesn't even taste  He just pours salt  What else does this  Health nut do?  Salt on everything  And buttermilk  Buttermilk  Did you prepare the buttermilk  With the crackers?  Well I wanted to wait  Until just before  He eats the crackers  So that way  They don't lose their crunch  He's gonna be able  To squeeze mustache wax  Out of his aorta  I definitely think  He should start  With the sandwich  Because as we discussed  The cracker 
[02:35:00]  Buttermilk concoction  Is a treat  It's like dessert  But it's timely  You gotta watch  The timing on that one  How does he  Warsh down the  Sardine sandwich?  How about if you  Had the buttermilk  And occasionally  You sprinkle a cracker  And when Fatso  Has to wash down  A little bit of  I'm just for the bit  He just threw his arms  Up in the air  When he wants to  Wash down some  You give him a little bit  Of buttermilk  And you sprinkle some cracker  And he spoons it  Into his mouth  And that way  You're eating a little treat  Along with the sandwich  I want to keep  The authenticity  Of Sam's dad 
[02:35:30]  And his consumption  Habits  Does your dad  Ever just drink  Buttermilk in a glass  Oh yeah  Okay then that's fine  Then give him a little  Glass of buttermilk  To wash it down  Warsh  Would anybody  Like to smell the buttermilk  I like to smell it  Yeah  That's a lot of warsh  I don't even have to  Get it too close  It's very strong  Oh my god  It is  It's very strong  It's like soury  I can't smell that  It kind of smells  Like it's  The milk went bad  No there's a little  More going on in there  Oh god this is  Smells like brush milk 
[02:36:00]  Anthony  No shop  Yes thank you  Oh god  That's the reaction  I had too  There's a sour butter smell  It's a salty treat  It actually probably  Is good with crackers  I gotta say  No effing way  It's probably good  With crackers  No it's not  Then eat it  Make sure that you  Take a big smell of it  Right before you take a gulp  Alright bring it over  Alright here's  Let's see what it looks like  When you pour it  I want to see what it looks like  Well it is  It is thick  It certainly is thick  Anthony 
[02:36:30]  Oh you can't even hear it  You know how like liquid  When you can't hear it  No no  It just kind of goes  Into itself  You're pouring motor oil  This is one entity  You're pouring like mercury  Or something  Right into it  Put that in a crank  40 weight milk  Very viscous  Alright where do you want  To eat this  Right here  Do you want to do it on camera  Or do you want me  To do it over there  They're filming it  Come over here  Go over there  I want you close  Get over there now  I'll just put the top piece  Of bread on the sandwich  Uh huh  Look at that  Tomorrow we'll have  Sandwiches 
[02:37:00]  There you go  Let's see  What's wrong  The onion smell  Well  Do you like onions  You rock  Yeah I do  Do you like sardines  I've never had sardines  They're actually good  Oh wait  Maybe in like Caesar salad  Or something  But that's about it  Sardines and Caesar salad  Oh it's anchovies  Yeah  Whatever  Sardines  Eric you'll like this  Alright  Which am I eating first  Well this  Have the sandwich  This is just your side dish  Okay  Your side dish 
[02:37:30]  You should try a sip of  Buttermilk first  Before you taint your mouth  They want you to  Wash out your palate  With some buttermilk  Yeah  Cleanse out your palate  Smell the buttermilk first  It's not bad  Like a fine wine  Smells like butter  Give it a smell  It's clumpy  Why are you shaking  I don't know  Yeah  It smells like ranch dressing  Really  Well you've drank that before  He brings in a thermos  Alright 
[02:38:00]  A little swig of  Buttermilk  Just have a sip  Just  Yeah  Hey Sam's dad drinks it  Go ahead  Here we go  It's probably good  Iraq  Yeah it is  It's terrible  Oof  Here he goes  Enjoy it  It's a great treat  Yeah  Enjoy the buttermilk  What happened  Alright so the great treat  So far  Is a bust

[02:44:00]  E-Rod  They do scrape the buttermilk right  Yeah they scrape it from the bottom of the barrel  Oh yeah  It smells sour  Oh it's all the goodness that's left over  It's probably a little like cow urine in there  Oh yeah  Yeah it's gotta be  It's a little of everything  Might even be some you know  Baby maker in there  When you look at a cow's udders  There are a lot of nooks and crannies in between the udders  And what collects in there is this dirt  Dirt, sweat, sweat  It's manure  Yeah  It's sweat  Yeah 
[02:44:30]  It's other stuff  And it actually forms these flat plates of gunk  Mm  Mm  That fall out into the milk and make black speckles  And I know that when they do the buttermilk  That's part of the byproduct also  That is filtered out and put in the buttermilk  Like hardened scabs in a way of gunk  That's what makes it so salty to tell you the truth  It's the bovine sweat that you're getting from the cow teat  This is starting to look like rice pudding  Oh good enjoy it 
[02:45:00]  It curdles real fast  It's getting a little clumpy  You're gonna say that about your waist later too  Rice pudding  That just  It smells like curdled like cottage cheese  It's a little cottage cheese  That's been left out a little too long  Enjoy your treat  Nice big warm mouthful  Yeah  Delicious warm mouthful  Make sure it's nice and warm  What a treat  It's nice to  What a treat  Sam  Sam  That's pushed away  He's shaking  Chew your milk  Big gulp

You're not done with the sandwich yet  Yeah  That's the reward right?  Yes  You don't get your dessert first  Clean plate club

[02:49:00]  I've seen crushed glass  Enjoy more than he's enjoying his meal  Sounds like the potato  Yeah bite into the potato again  I want to hear the potato  And some pickle  Yeah  And then wash it all down  With the buttermilk  Butter  Buttermilk  Get a nice big bite of the potato for everybody  It sounds good on the radio  Yeah  Yeah  It's good  Iraq can't even really stand up straight  No he's shaking  He doesn't look good  Sam it's official  Your dad is a weirdo  He actually enjoys this 
[02:49:30]  Oh here goes the  Here goes the potato  Raw potato  Doesn't it sound wet and uncooked?  It sounds awful  But it's so inviting  I've never been able to hear  Compared to everything else  I've never been able to hear  Hear something that tastes awful  Yeah  That sounds terrible  This is the best part of the meal  It kills the taste of everything else 
[02:50:00]  Oh good  Then you need some sandwich  You want to wash it down  With some more buttermilk?  Now you gotta wash it all down  With a nice  Brand new cup  That he's got  That's right  Delicious  Milk butter byproduct  Before the skin forms at the top  Yeah  Like when you leave pudding out  Yeah  It gets a skin on it  And then you leave it out longer  And it cracks like an earthquake  Yeah  Good stuff  Good stuff  Righty  Oh yeah 
[02:50:30]  Come on Iraq  Alright Iraq  It's like drinking out of a giant zit  If you're just turning in the Iraq  He just put the cup down  After Jimmy's comment  He's taking a little more time  Oh it is  Isn't it like  Pustule fluid?  Yeah  That's true  How else can we describe this?  Some kind of sample  Yeah  Do you ever squeeze one  That just takes so long  And then it finally gives  And just all over the mirror?  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  Are you actually chewing the buttermilk?  Some people want to know  Supposed to  Is it lumpy yet? 
[02:51:00]  Not yet  This buttermilk  Roll that around in your mouth  The buttermilk really changes form pretty quickly  Yeah  If you're just turning in, Iraq is enjoying some of the greatest treats of all time  According to Sam's dad  Yes  This is amazing  Because he really doesn't like this  No  Well, the buttermilk  Wow, look at that  It's a big, nice, full cup again  No, no  That's okay  I've seen it  You can do it  Alright  It's globby  Don't go with a little dabble, do you, either 
[02:51:30]  We're looking for a nice, big mouthful  Wait, can we have him do a little  In his mouth?  Oh, yeah, yeah  Like a little swish it around  Yeah, yeah  Sometimes you use the drink that you're washing down everything with  To kind of cleanse your teeth and your palate and your tongue  Swish it around  Why don't you swish it around your mouth a little bit?  Yeah, you should, Iraq  Steven S. from Bayshore, usually good with the lines  He's just writing today, Iraq effing rules  Yeah  No jokes, just saying, Iraq effing rules  Yeah, swish it around your mouth  Go ahead  Before you wash out your mouth 
[02:52:00]  Looks like he's drinking a tumor  Yeah  Oh, Jesus  Oh, no  Now swallow that delicious  It came out  He can't drink it  Oh, he can't do it  How is this a treat in your house, Sam?  There's a man vomiting from drinking it  This is supposed to be a treat 
[02:52:30]  Iraq, why don't you bite into the potato  Because that's the only thing that helps you out  How about some pickle?  I think that would be helpful too  Yeah, get that pickle  How about a combo?  A little bite of the pickle  And a nice big bite of the raw potato  Yeah  Is it an acquired taste?  Or I don't understand  It's just  It's one of the great treats  Of course  Of all time  Yeah  We figured that out  I say you enjoy some pickle without the potato first  I don't like the way you're trying to kill the pickle taste  I know  That's cheating and it bothers me  Get that pickle  You're wasting 
[02:53:00]  He seems to like the pickle last time  Sure he does  Right after the buttermilk  Ah, the pickle has got to be very inviting  Inviting at this point  He's angry  What's wrong?  His face looks angry  Now you don't like the pickle anymore?  Why do you have such an angry face?  I have no taste buds left  This is burning  He looks like little Steven on the Sopranos  He's making that  Yes, still  Yeah, thank you  I can remember his character name  And a big 
[02:53:30]  There he goes  Heating a granite countertop  Oh, E-Rock  We're taking  Ant's taking a video with his flip  Oh yeah  I'll put some of this up on my Facebook later  And I've been sending pictures out  To all the followers on Twitter  OP Radio on Twitter  I'm sending pictures out  As E-Rock enjoys the greatest treats of all time  Or some of  Some of  Of all time 
[02:54:00]  Yeah  I want to know  In time  What some of the other treats are  Yeah  Obviously  Not today though  Oh no  That would be crazy  No, we're concentrating on these  The wonderfulness of the buttermilk  Around the holidays  Your father will enjoy a gravel driveway  Can you eat enough of the sardine sandwich?  Only half  No, only half  Oh, well  He's got to finish that up  What do you want to do, E-Rock?  People starving  We're heading toward a break  But what do you want to do?

These are some of the  Greatest treats the world has seen  Yeah  In my dad's typical  Sunday lunch  Yeah  Like a lazy Sunday lunch  That's what makes this so great  I mean, we could do this  We could get the same reaction  From Fear Factor crap  Yes  This is regular crap  Back city, bam-a-lam  Whoa, back city, bam-a-lam  She really gets me high  I'm a lamb, you know  That's no lie  I'm a lamb, she's so rock city  I'm a lamb, she's always late  I'm a lamb, whoa  Whoa, back city, bam-a-lam 
[02:57:00]  You're listening to the worst of 2009. 
[02:57:30]  Suck my tennis comp.  So far on the virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 so far for the Opie and Anthony show.  E-Rock is me.  Primetime Sam Roberts is me.  My name's longer.  Yes.  So that means more important.  And he gets top billing.  You're headlining.  Of course I do. 
[02:58:00]  It's Primetime Sam Roberts and the rest.  But there's one other name that actually beats out Primetime Sam Roberts on the show.  Who?  That would have to be our good friend Ted Sheckler.  Of course.  Ted Sheckler is a regular with the Opie and Anthony show.  And in 2009 has made some very memorable appearances.  Yes.  We found out more about his various business ventures.  Of course.  Yeah, he's an entrepreneur to say the least.  And this happens to be one of them.  Of course, it's Ted's movie memorabilia.  Our favorite Ted bit so far. 
[02:58:30]  Probably yours too.  And you'll only hear it here on the worst of 2009 so far as presented to you by the Opie and  Anthony show.  Have you ever listened to the worst?  The worst.  No, I don't want to be involved in this.  The worst.  Yeah.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Who is that?  It's Professor Ted Frump.  Ted, Ted, Ted Burns.  Teddy Rash.  Ted Portnore.  Ted's Match Emporium.  Ted's Inflatable Rat Factory.  Ted's Egg Emporium. 
[02:59:00]  You're listening to the Ted Show.  Ted's an ass.  Let's say hi to Richie in O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  I found some Back to the Future memorabilia on Ted's movie memorabilia website.  That is exactly a very good site.  I sell all the rare items.  What do you have, Ted, from Back to the Future?  Because I'd really like to...  I have a shoelace that was in Christopher Lloyd's shoe when he arrived on set.  I have a cup that had coffee in it, so Michael G. Fox spilled it. 
[02:59:30]  I have things for every movie.  Oh, what other movies?  I don't know.  You name a movie, I'll tell you what I got.  All right.  What do you have from, like, Star Wars, maybe, or something?  I have some dirt that Darth Vader stepped in.  Oh, so it's a footprint of Darth Vader?  No, it's just the footprint wasn't preserved.  It's some dirt that was under the boot of James Earl Jones.  Oh, I thought it was maybe a plastic castle footprint, which would kind of be cool. 
[03:00:00]  No, it was originally tracked onto the carpet by Lando Calrissian.  But James Earl Jones wasn't actually in the Vader suit.  That's why it's so rare, Daniel.  It was actually that big guy from...  Yes, David Prowse.  Clockwork Orange.  But one day, James Earl Jones showed up, and David said,  Get that jig-a-boo out of my suit.  I don't think he said that.  It was very inappropriate.  That's very inappropriate, nasty, and rude.  Yes, I didn't care for that type of talk.  Yes, you can't have that kind of talk about such a fantastic actor. 
[03:00:30]  I couldn't agree more, Anthony.  Yes, Gregory.  Do you have anything from the Godfather series?  I certainly do.  I have three of Marlon Brando's mustache hairs.  Mustache hairs.  They fell out by the car when he was shot, when Fredo fumbled with the weapon.  I also have some gravel that was on the ground that got caught in his pant leg when he fell.  How could you get that but not get something better?  If you were that close to get mustache hairs and gravel, couldn't you have gotten maybe the prop gun that Fredo had? 
[03:01:00]  I had that, but I traded it for the mustache hairs and a piece of lemon pie.  Oh, okay.  I have very rare movie items.  Do you have anything from The Shining?  I bet Ant would love something from The Shining.  I certainly do.  I have red gelatin that was used to come out the side of the door, I believe.  Or maybe it was on the children's head.  I have a swatch of carpeting.  That was in room 501, which wasn't featured in the movie. 
[03:01:30]  There is no 501.  Yes.  Sometimes.  Wow.  Reposably false.  I don't understand why you would have something like that and not get something from The Shining, like one of the knives.  I had the axe that he was chasing the boy with, but I traded it for hedge seeds.  Why would you want hedge seeds?  So I could make my own maze in my living room and run through it for hours. 
[03:02:00]  But you had the axe.  That's like a key prop from the movie.  Yes, I had that, but I would refuse entry on seven straight planes.  I would carry my axe and go here.  I'm checking this.  I wish I had a Scatman Crothers related piece.  Oh, wow.  Imagine that.  Yes.  That painting.  I used to have that, but I traded it for the comforter he was laying on.  I have that, the comforter.  And I have three of his giant black toenail clippings. 
[03:02:30]  I use them as visors when I play cards.  Well, that's very unique memorabilia.  Yes, it is.  I don't see that on eBay or anything like that.  No, it's very, very, very hard to get things.  Yes, yes.  A lot of stuff's easy.  Yeah, anyone can.  Who's getting those toenails?  They certainly can.  That movie was very frightening.  Yes, I was frightened watching it.  Yes, I also have the Continental Airlines seat that he sat in. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, you do?  Yes, I do.  I sit in my living room when I watch television.  That actually sounds like a pretty good prop.  Yes, it is.  It's not the original, though.  Oh, well, wait a minute.  It's actually the chair they used in rehearsal.  It's just a plastic chair.  But they said this is the one he pretended he was on the plane.  So, but Scatman sat in it?  That's what I've been told.  I spent $4,000 on that.  I certainly hope so.  And I traded Jack Nicholson's jacket. 
[03:03:30]  The jacket that he wore, the shining.  I traded that for the seat that Scatman sat on, allegedly.  That would have been something to have.  I don't know.  You hear the organ that actually is playing this music?  Yeah, you have that?  No, I'm just enjoying the music with you.  They wanted me to.  Somebody tried to sell me this, but I didn't believe it was the actual organ.  You have anything speaking to Nicholson from Cuckoo's Nest?  That's a great question.  Yes, I do.  Oh.  What do you got?  What do you got from Cuckoo's Nest? 
[03:04:00]  An indented pillow.  Is it the pillow that Chief used?  I've been told.  And I have broken glass from the window that Chief threw the giant sink through.  And I have water from that sink.  I drink it on a daily basis.  Whatever happened to the sink?  What's that?  Whatever happened to the sink?  I had that.  I traded for shards of glass.  Who needs a big, heavy sink, Gregory?  You seem to have given away a lot of good memorabilia for stuff that people really wouldn't care about.  I've had a bunch of bunk memorabilia, and I traded it for rare items. 
[03:04:30]  Well, I can't wait to maybe come over and see your collection.  Oh, it's fantastic.  And I have the $25 that Mr. Hardy was going to bet.  That he was going to bet.  Yep, and I have a pack of Mr. Cheswick cigarettes.  And I have one of Louise Fletcher's vaginal lips.  How do you get that, Ted?  I was on my front porch.  Somebody thought it was a slug, and they threw salt on it. 
[03:05:00]  Nice.  Oh, God damn.  Where can we see the rest of this stuff, Ted?  You got a website?  I'm working on a website.  Yeah?  Yes, I'm trying to use my computer.  I have DOS prompt.  I'm C-prompting.  C-prompt?  Why don't you get an operating system like Windows or Mac?  Yes.  See, right now I'm trying to get Ted Sheckler's rare, yet not impossible, to get movie memorabilia.com.  But that's cyber squatters have it. 
[03:05:30]  It sounds like something somebody wouldn't have, and it's very inconvenient.  They tried to hijack me for $7.  We're going to court in May.  That's a long name.  It certainly is, Anthony.  It's hard to type in.  Yes.  Ted's memorabilia didn't sound right to me.  That would have been easy, though.  Exactly.  Who needs easy?  Ted, we're getting a question from James in Michigan.  Oh, welcome aboard, James.  Thanks for calling the program.  Do you have any people? 
[03:06:00]  You sound like Gregory.  Do you have any Pink Panther memorabilia?  Oh, yes, I do.  Yeah?  I actually have Peter Sellers spleen in a jar.  Really?  Yes, I do.  I bet you Steve Martin's jealous that you have that.  Yes, he is.  He sometimes, he wears it as a hat, and we all make little jokes.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Yes.  I have a toilet, which is where that piece of shit should have been played for.  All right, there you go.  Ted, what's the website again? 
[03:06:30]  Ted's...  Ted Sheckler's rare.  Yeah, not impossible to get moviememorabilia.com.  Oh, my God.  That's impossible.  I just had a brain out of it.  That's impossible.  I had a brain out of it.  I'm trying to remember that.  That wouldn't even fit on the top of the webpage.  That's right.  Yeah.  Ted, everyone.  I fucking love Ted, man.  I love Ted.  You're listening to The Ted Show.  I'm Ted the Whale Watcher.  I'm Ted Hitler.  I'm Ted Hitler Jones.  The Ted the Jones part of the good parts.  Dear Corinthians. 
[03:07:00]  Hi, Corinthians.  Ted again.  I'm Ted the Bad Push-Ass.  Ted.  Dr. Ted Kocko in studio today.  Did you understand that this is a big thing happening?  How wild that would be?  It hurts your ears.  I'm Ted the Rich Boss.  Yes.  I'm Ted the Rabbit Tooth Jew.  I'm Ted Sullivan Baker.  Oh.  I'm Ted.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I investigate the paranormal.  Oh, Ted. 
[03:07:30]  Yes, I am very afraid of ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  Yes.  I hate ghosts.  I hate ghosts.  Ghosts.  Ghosts.  Scare me tremendously, Robert.  I'm just.  I'm just.  It's the worst of 2009. 
[03:08:00]  I'm getting deuce chills.  So far.  On the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009.  So far, the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  And this is E-Rock.  That would be me.  Yes.  And what we like to do sometimes, so far in 2009, Anthony's birthday has already passed.  Yes.  And when big celebrities of the show, like Opie, Anthony, Jim, or Sam Roberts, have a  birthday, we try to get celebrity call-ins that relate to them. 
[03:08:30]  Mm-hmm.  So for Anthony's birthday, we took a character from, an iconic character from his favorite  movie of all time.  Godfather.  Doc Brown from Back to the Future.  Wow.  Wasn't even close.  The best part about this call is the way Christopher Lloyd calls in.  But he embraces the Doc Brown character.  Like, Gary Coleman came in and just didn't want anything to do with Different Strokes.  No.  Wanted to get as far away from him as possible.  But Doc Brown, you know, Christopher Lloyd, completely was one with the character. 
[03:09:00]  He loved it.  Doc Brown made money.  Gary Coleman didn't.  And I guess maybe that's what it is.  Doc Brown's parents didn't take all his cash.  Also, I want to point out that we work for some guys who don't like to have their birthday  acknowledged, but kind of do.  Yeah.  They really don't.  So they don't want gifts.  They don't want presents.  And if you do anything right off the bat, they act like they're insulted and angry until  they see what it is.  So when this surprise guest was calling in, listen to how Anthony reacted.  We said, oh, there was somebody on the phone for him.  Yeah.  And then listen to the way his little voice perks up when he realizes who it is and how 
[03:09:30]  well it's going.  Yes.  On the worst of 2009.  So far, the Opie and Anthony show.  What the fuck is this?  You're listening to the worst.  What the fuck is this?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I don't know what's going on.  The guys behind the scenes really set up a nice surprise, I guess, for Anthony.  I have no idea.  They said, Anthony, we got a surprise before we went to break.  We got a surprise.  He goes, oh, great.  What the fuck is this going to be?  Yeah.  Because we hate surprises.  We hate them.  And show surprises are usually just bad and embarrassing. 
[03:10:00]  Immediately, Anthony was like, look, I don't want to be touched.  I don't want to get up and do anything.  Yeah.  I don't want it to be.  I have to participate thing where I'm or some hooker comes over and grabs me and I  smell like hooker all day.  Hello?  Well, why don't we just go?  It's just a phone call.  You can get rid of a phone call.  Yes, I can.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Is this Anthony?  Yes. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, great Scott.  Thanks for your birthday.  No way.  Oh, my God.  Am I right?  Or am I right?  Is this real?  Yeah.  Come on.  Wow.  For real?  Doc Brown.  Doc Brown.  Well, how are you, sir?  Happy birthday.  How are you doing?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  What a...  I am flabbergasted that one of my favorite stars is calling for my birthday. 
[03:11:00]  This is fantastic.  Well...  You do not know how many times I have watched you, even in number three, in Back to the Future  three, which, you know, even a big Back to the Future fan, three is kind of meh, meh.  But you, you pull it off.  Well, that was my favorite.  Number three.  Number three?  Yeah.  Wow!  I had romance. 
[03:11:30]  I had all that stuff with the trade.  I had a horseback riding.  It was a Western.  I mean...  And a red log.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, how are you?  I'm doing great.  Thank you.  I'm here.  I'm good.  I'm working.  What are you working on these days?  I'll do some sort of film in Detroit in a couple of weeks.  I don't know.  It depends.  I'm just keeping my stuff moving along. 
[03:12:00]  I have to ask you something.  You were always so concerned about the whole future and you shouldn't know about it and  don't mess with the past.  Yet you gave Marty the hoverboard at one point.  You said, here, take your floating device to go back into the Old West with.  That's ridiculous.  Why would you do that?  Golly.  You know, I never gave it a second thought.  Oh, okay.  All right.  At least that makes sense. 
[03:12:30]  You know, you're a little scatterbrained.  I can understand that.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, a fluke there in my key.  I don't know.  That's good.  I'm going to be thinking about that all day.  Yeah, well, I've been thinking about it for years and I've never really gotten a straight  answer because for all the times you don't want to affect the future by screwing around  with the past, you certainly screw around with the past a lot.  I don't have a good rationale there.  Good rationale. 
[03:13:00]  I mean, as we've learned throughout the Back to the Future series, Doc Brown, for all of  his smarts, never really used good common sense during any of the movies.  Like, why in the world would you think that ripping off Iranian terrorists was going to  be a good idea?  Libyan, by the way.  Libyan's what I say.  I'm a Libyan terrorist.  I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've, I've had some, some, somebody a few years ago came up to me of Arabic descent and  I was quite offended by that. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, you know what?  It's so good to, it's, it's refreshing.  I think that's why that movie holds up too.  It's refreshing to watch a movie from a time where it didn't matter.  You know, you could actually use characters like that and it was fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, yeah, it's gotten a little too, uh, stuffy these days.  Uh, I gotta ask you also quickly about maybe, um, uh, Eric Stoltz being cast, uh, as Marty  McFly at the beginning.  How is that working with him?  And did you, did you yourself see a problem, uh, working with him that, that maybe the producers 
[03:14:00]  saw?  And that's the reason, uh, he was, uh, I mean, they, he, he was in it for about six weeks  before they made the change, but I had no idea whatsoever.  And he was, you know, a very good actor and everything seemed to be going well between  us and all, but apparently he didn't have just a little bit, they wanted a kind of a  comic edge and they felt, uh, you know, the producers, everybody felt that that was, 
[03:14:30]  had to be there and, and he didn't quite have that.  He was playing it seriously well, you know, I was playing the situation and all that, but  they wanted, you know, Michael, Michael's got that comic flair.  Did you, did you notice that?  Like, even, even though you thought Eric Stoltz was doing a good job at the time, did you  notice once they cast Michael J. Fox?  No, I didn't, I had no idea, you know, because I, you know, I didn't know that clearly what 
[03:15:00]  they were looking for.  And I was trying to, you know, survive and hope that I was, you know, not going to be the  one, so, um, no, I didn't, it was a big surprise.  We came back, we were working in a huge industrial, um, area where that parking lot was where they,  you know, and we all gathered after lunch, which, which was 1 a.m. in the morning.  Spielberg was there, Bob Zemeckis and everybody, there was something very solemn about it and 
[03:15:30]  kind of grizzly and the announcement was made, it was made with a, with kind of deep, with  that, and, uh, you know, because, uh, suddenly the next day was Michael.  Were you at all, uh, annoyed that you had to reshoot all those scenes?  Because, I mean, I know that you did shoot at least a, you know, a good portion of the  scenes with, uh.  Yeah, I'm not really annoyed, I was just hoping that I could repeat myself.  Oh, right, yeah, it's like, damn it, I did a good job.  Or at least do it better, you know.  I think you did it. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, I think you pulled it off.  Did you ever go on the, uh, did you ever go on the ride, the, uh.  Oh, yes.  Back to the Future ride?  When it opened up, uh, I think I went on it four or five times and nearly made myself  six.  Yeah.  I gotta tell you, it's probably one of the best rides I ever went on and I hear that's  not, uh, not there anymore, is that true?  No, it's, uh, it's, uh, I forget the, uh, uh, uh, comic, the comic.  Yeah, they, they, they put the Simpsons ride.  Oh.  Yeah.  And that might be pretty exciting because they're using the same setup, the same kind 
[03:16:30]  of the, you know, um.  Right, that motion, uh.  That motion, all that.  It really fools the senses, man, when you're flying through the, uh, uh, Hill Valley there  and, and, and, uh, you're actually getting some motion, uh, it really was a great, uh,  great ride.  They put that, that.  They got to dive down into that crevice and all, it was, like, amazing.  Yeah, they put that in the, uh, DVD that they just released.  They put the, uh, footage from the ride and, uh.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it is very cool to watch, um, on a giant screen. 
[03:17:00]  I have a question for Christopher.  Jim, Jim Norton is, uh, here also.  Yeah, Jim, Jim Norton here.  It's not your birthday, is it?  No, no, no, no.  I just wanted to, no, an odd question.  I said a question for you.  Yes, that's Jim Norton.  Um, I'm a big taxi fan, and how come only the first three seasons have come out?  Is Taxi Season 4 going to come out?  That's a great question.  For real.  I'm out of my mind about Taxi Season 4.  A lot of taxi fans here.  Um, I'm not aware of this season 4.  It never came out on, uh, on repeat. 
[03:17:30]  On DVD?  No, I'm very hurt.  I have no idea.  Okay.  I didn't even know that.  All right.  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah, see, Jimmy, what do you think?  He's putting these things out?  I don't know.  He might know.  From his garage?  It was a bad question.  It was a good question.  Wow.  Well, I...  I'll work on it.  I, uh, I don't want to keep you, and thank you so much for, uh, this birthday.  Oh, I have one.  I'm stunned.  Uh, Christopher Lloyd, man.  It's, uh, fantastic. 
[03:18:00]  Can I compliment you on something before you go, Chris?  Anthony, this is Anthony's birthday gift, but I just wanted to tell you how much I loved  you rooting for McMurphy to kill Nurse Ratched at the end of Cuckoo's Nest.  Yeah, yeah.  I was, I was like a, you know, a dream.  And, uh, and of course, one of the best Klingons in any, uh, Star Trek movie.  Christopher Lloyd.  Yes, very, just ruthless.  Ruthless.  I loved it.  Uh, Christopher Lloyd, thank you so much. 
[03:18:30]  This is, uh, like such a great birthday present.  You're, uh, one of my personal heroes.  Have a great birthday, and I wish you the best.  And, um, who knows, we'll maybe do this again sometime.  Well, come on in and see us when you're in New York.  If you're in New York, we'd love to have you in the studio.  All right.  All right, sir.  I actually know where, I actually know where you live, so.  I'll just, that sounds like a threat, Opie.  No, I, I.  Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Whoa!  It's, it's, it's, it's our little secret, because I was walking home one day, and, and 
[03:19:00]  here comes, here comes Christopher Lloyd walking out, and I was the one that, uh, took a picture  of you and, uh, a couple big fans.  Oh, well, okay then.  I want, I want, I want poppy.  So I'll just, uh, check in with your doorman every once in a while and see if you're back  in town, and then, you know, then we'll go out for coffee, and we'll set up the whole  thing.  All right, all right, thank you, Dan.  All right, Mr. Lloyd, thank you so much.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  I hope I didn't scare him.  I'll just try to have fun. 
[03:19:30]  My friend, what a great, Steve.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Uh, thank you so much.  I did that.  I went through my friend, Brian Scalero.  My friend, Brian Scalero, did a sitcom with him.  I don't believe a word you say ever, though.  Chuck, Chuck, it's Marvin, your cousin Marvin Berry.  You know that new sound you're looking for?  Well, listen to this.  All right, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[03:20:00]  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're listening to the worst of the worst of 2009 so far on the virus. 
[03:20:30]  Sirius 197 XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 so far on the Opian Anthony show.  I am Iraq and celebrity guest host, primetime Sam Roberts.  Yes, it's me, primetime Sam Roberts.  I took a little bit of time out of my busy schedule to enjoy the worst of 2009 so far with all of you, my fellow Opian Anthony listeners.  Now, before we go into ONA's worst of the worst of the worst of 2009 so far, let's talk about the accomplishments for primetime Sam Roberts for 2009 so far. 
[03:21:00]  You've had a string of celebrity interviews.  That's true.  I mean, the celebrities have been knocking down my door.  I mean, we're talking about hip hop's greatest, pop music's greatest.  Super models.  Super models.  Pro wrestlers.  Political figures.  They all want to talk to primetime Sam Roberts because they know that I not only get the hard-hitting questions in, but my fan base is completely loyal.  Yes.  And so they will buy whatever it is I'm selling. 
[03:21:30]  But enough about me, Eric.  Let's talk about some porn stars.  Hmm.  Porn stars in 2009.  That would have to be Taya Parker.  I don't know if she's really a porn star.  She was a penthouse model.  Well, yeah.  She was in penthouse.  And you know her best from Rock of Love.  Yes.  Bus.  The winner.  She won the bus.  Yes.  Not Bret Michaels.  She just got the bus.  Well, I think that was the thing.  Yeah.  It's whoever falls in love with the bus.  And who was with her?  Shana Lanay, of course.  Now, we didn't know much about her body of work until we had her in studio and decided to Google her. 
[03:22:00]  And we did it while she was sitting there.  Instead of doing some prep ahead of time, we did it while the interview was happening.  And instead of Googling her, we Googled imaged her.  That is true.  And I think it went well.  I think it was a really informative interview.  That is not true at all.  No?  She left in tears.  As a matter of fact, if you don't believe me, why don't you listen for yourself?  On the worst of O&A, 2009 so far.  Here it is. 
[03:22:30]  It's the worst.  No.  It's so good.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  We have the two girls from Penthouse, Taya Parker and Shana Lanay.  Hopefully, they're coming in.  And they're going to walk into this stench palace because that liquid ass was...  Excuse the smell in here.  It isn't us.  It's liquid ass, it's called.  It's horrible.  Yeah, why wouldn't you put one on each bike, Yorick? 
[03:23:00]  It's horrible.  What are you doing?  They're sitting here.  They're sitting right here.  What?  I don't know.  Oh, thanks a lot, you cock-blocking motherfucker Jimmy Norton.  That wasn't me.  I didn't ask him.  You told her to move.  No, I was saying one on each bike.  It stinks in this...  It's terrible in here.  What the hell now?  It's a little dropper bottle of something called liquid ass that everyone thinks is hysterical  until it wafts over your way.  Can we give her a booster seat at least?  I know.  I feel like I'm in the kiddie section.  Yeah.  I have to. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Give her another seat.  I'm going to do something that is going to be very unusual.  I think Ann's only seen this once or twice.  I'm going to apologize to you.  You're going to apologize to me?  Why?  When I came in, I was thinking, I'm just going to mess with her.  And I was an asshole.  And I threw everything I had at you.  And you were cool as shit.  Oh, stop it.  You don't have to apologize to me.  And then even after the show, I'm like, oh, you know, it's for the radio.  It's just...  It's your show.  You can beat me up if you want.  No, but it wasn't fair. 
[03:24:00]  I mean, usually we beat the shit out of people we, you know, have a problem with.  That's okay, honey.  You don't have to apologize.  You ended up doing like backwards flips into guys' faces.  Yeah, it was amazing.  It was amazing shit you were doing for everybody.  This girl's jumping through hoops and I'm just being mean.  And then our good friend, Bret Michaels, comes in and goes, this Taya chick is, you know,  is the real deal.  She's awesome.  Aw, did he say nice things about me?  Absolutely he did.  Aw, how sweet.  You brought your friend Shauna today.  I did.  Isn't she cute?  How'd you get into the business?  I got into the business when I was 18 and five days old and it was what I always wanted. 
[03:24:30]  She said 18 and five days.  Really?  Nice.  That's so cute.  The 18th part.  So the, oh.  Son?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You just had the five days?  So.  18 and five days.  So, you know, it's right after your 18th birthday.  You've always, you always wanted to do it?  Yeah.  Well, not always, but for a few years.  Until when?  I mean, since like what?  How old?  12.  Really?  Yes.  You knew at 12?  Yeah.  I thought it was going to be that. 
[03:25:00]  I discovered internet porn at the age of 12.  Yeah.  Internet porn.  I love internet porn.  Who was the first porn guy you looked at or who was one porn guy you looked at when  I really want to fuck him?  Oh, no.  I looked at girls.  Yeah.  A girl looking at girls at first.  I love naked girls.  All right.  Well, who did you look at that you realized?  We have so much in common.  I don't even know their names.  I mean, I wasn't like a 12 year old porn fan.  Again, we have so much in common.  12 year old porn fan.  It didn't really matter what their names were. 
[03:25:30]  A 12 year old porn fan.  More in common than you thought, Angela.  I mean, I didn't know the names.  That wasn't one of my priorities to know.  So now, what was your first gig at 18 and five days?  It was for Joey Silvera's service.  This is a horrible title.  Service animals.  Service animals is great.  Service animals number 21.  No animals were involved.  Thank you guys.  What you did?  I did a regular boy girl scene.  I was totally dressed as a really young girl.  With pigtails.  Of course.  She's going to be able to play the really young girl forever. 
[03:26:00]  No, I don't play it.  They don't hire me anymore.  Because I'm not a teenager.  Most companies are guaranteed teens.  Oh, yeah.  So as soon as I hit 20, I cried.  I was like, oh.  Fuck over the hill.  Do you want to retire?  At 20?  From the teen porn?  Yeah.  Wow.  She blew out a cliff.  She blew out a cliff.  You know, it was this guy.  How?  It was this guy named Trent.  I don't even know what happened to him.  It was actually one of his first scenes, too.  Oh.  Yeah?  And before your breast enhancement, were you very small? 
[03:26:30]  I had nothing.  So you really pulled off the kid thing?  Yeah, I hated it.  No, what about like after, you know, so you get into it, you do that.  Was it easy to start getting a little more hardcore?  What do you do?  Like anything?  I just started out hardcore.  DP and shit like that?  Oh, no.  No?  Oh, no.  What kind of hardcore stuff do you do?  I don't do, okay.  Well, that hardcore that you're talking about, I don't do hardcore.  Like, I don't do anal.  No.  I only do straight up boy-girl scenes with like five guys that I know. 
[03:27:00]  Five guys.  Not at the same time?  No.  No.  That would be fun, but you know, I can't be put out like that.  Yeah.  I guess there's a line that every girl draws.  You're talking, the scene starts, clothes come off, you start sucking his dick, he goes  down on you, some straight fucking, pulls it out in your mouth, comes on your face.  Yeah.  That's how it goes.  You are ornery, Anthony.  Scene.  Scene.  That's the routine.  What?  You are ornery. 
[03:27:30]  No, I'm just, I was just describing.  He's just like, he's the blunt to the point guy.  I love it.  Yeah.  I'm absolutely unexcited about the entire date.  No, because that's cool.  I like that, because you could fast forward.  Don't make me come over there.  To your favorite shit without having to guess.  That's really the routine.  It's like, what's coming up?  All right.  I want to see a cump shot on her face.  I want to see him fucking.  I want, you know, the back of the balls shot.  Like that, you know.  Wow.  You got that camera down there.  Here's a little action shot.  There you go.  Holy mother of.  Oh, whoa.  Do you remember that dick?  That's a nice action shot right there.  Yeah.  That was a good one. 
[03:28:00]  I came really hard on that thing.  And this, I'm actually having sex with this guy who was like, my mom's boyfriend.  Because she wouldn't let me go out with my boyfriend.  So it was like, payback's a bitch.  So he comes over and, hi, how are you?  I totally seduced him.  Wow.  Your mom's not home.  What are you doing here?  No, I seduced him.  Hey, what are you doing to me?  One of those things.  No, I seduced him.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's what I mean.  It's like, you go over and you start going like, hi.  And he's like, what?  But I'm your mom's boyfriend.  Yeah, pretty much.  I like pretty much drag him into the room.  Until his fat schlong comes out.  Did you write the script for this? 
[03:28:30]  That was a good one.  Oh boy, I've seen so many.  I love them.  Wow.  That's a fat kid.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Come on.  He's fucking on the diet.  Eric, I'm sorry you had to hear that.  I get that one off.  Thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, you don't like that one?  I just don't want to put out and stuff.  Who's the guy?  I don't know.  Wow.  You don't like that one, huh?  No, can you please change that picture?  No, it's not.  Because it's not a flattering picture.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  What better photo a person?  You need to put up this picture.  Look how pretty. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, that is.  This is a good picture.  Right here.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't worry about that shit.  That's right.  Nothing.  You guys are so bad.  Yeah.  You guys are really mean.  Actually.  No, we really are.  Except to all the main tricks over there.  He's monitoring the mouth over there.  I swear to God.  Actually, am I being mean?  Anthony, you're being great.  Fuck, what did I do?  Really?  Serious.  For a second.  What did I do that with me?  Because I was just like interviewing you in the way I would interview somebody that does  adult films.  I realize that. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  I apologize.  Do you feel Anthony was too harsh in his descriptions?  I just would rather be seen as a penthouse pet today and not an adult film hardcore sex  addict.  Oh my God.  She said sex addict.  What happened?  I can't take it.  Anthony loves you.  I got too many fucking girls upset with me today.  Enough of this shit.  Oh shit.  Why are people upset with you?  Why did you upset with you in?  Why?  Because I must be a fucking asshole.  There's enough big juicy cock for all.  Yeah.  That's true.  Anthony loves you, by the way. 
[03:30:00]  I swear to God.  I think you're stunning.  He adores you.  Shit, did I fuck this up?  No, you didn't.  It's all salvageable.  No.  Look at her face.  I'm sorry.  I think if you go over there and give her a foot massage, she'll forgive you.  Wait, she's pissed, Anthony.  Go give her a foot massage and she'll forgive you.  My feet totally don't hurt anymore.  I'll give you a foot massage.  She's here to promote penthouse.  She is.  Yeah.  I mean, she's on stands right now.  So we're here trying to get everybody to buy this issue and come see us at the romantic  depot.  See, I was just trying to make a conversation. 
[03:30:30]  But remember before?  Everything was fine before.  It was fine before.  Can we go back to when it was all fine?  Yes, we can.  I didn't screw it up.  I've been getting pissed off for like 20 minutes now.  Are you shitting me?  No kidding.  What part got you?  No kidding.  What part got you?  Like, you guys make me feel like a little girl and you keep calling me cute.  And then you make me feel like so dirty.  No.  Like, you really, you guys do.  You're making me feel gross and young and a little girl.  Well, you've got a huge cock in your mouth.  What are we supposed to do?  No, no.  That is unnecessary.  It really is. 
[03:31:00]  That is really unnecessary.  We don't know.  The fans aren't on the computers at all.  Yeah, well, who's it?  That would be Danny.  Okay, can we stop?  Danny pops them up there.  Yeah.  I have to say, I think you're being a little sensitive about it.  No.  I mean, I don't.  Jimmy.  I'm not here promoting come on my face right now.  I'm here promoting.  No.  Well, it looks like you're just, we're looking like a.  That isn't even what I'm here promoting.  This is stuff that you've done in your career, right?  This isn't what I'm promoting today.  I understand, but it's something that you've done.  It's in your past.  If we had De Niro.  This is not what I'm promoting.  This is not from penthouse. 
[03:31:30]  But if we had De Niro in studio, we'd be talking about Raging Bull and Dog Day after.  Well, penthouse.  Can I be honest?  I think one reason, though, you got to say this, is the video that was on the council  for me when I got here.  Yeah.  Is that one?  It was a penthouse.  It's called Bring Me the Head of Shawna Linnae.  So it is a penthouse video.  Yes.  Well, she's promoting penthouse.  But she's saying that's not penthouse.  That is not penthouse.  No.  We're not promoting that stuff today.  The radio audience cannot see that.  No.  What they hear is our descriptions.  Well, I hope not. 
[03:32:00]  How could the radio audience see it?  No, no.  They don't see it.  They don't see it.  So what they hear is us describing scenes which are sexy of you, which makes people want  to go out and buy you.  I didn't know she was getting mad for 20 minutes.  I am getting this.  3, 2, 1.  I thought I was doing very well with you.  Wow.  Scene from Arthur.  It's funny.  Yeah, Anthony was really digging you.  Let's talk about Rock and Love Bus.  I thought it was like...  Can we talk about what we're supposed to be talking about?  Let's talk about Rock and Love Bus.  No.  No.  Yeah, you really are starting to...  You're even starting to annoy me and I'm very easy.  Hey, Jimmy.  I gotta be honest. 
[03:32:30]  I'm very tolerant, but this...  The penthouse video.  We're promoting penthouse as a brand.  Yeah.  Talking about hardcore stuff.  Saying the pictures are very sexy.  And, you know, come on.  You guys were not putting sexy pictures up there.  They are.  You guys were picking up the worst pictures you guys could find and putting them up there.  No, it's not.  Yeah, you were.  I swear.  I swear they're...  He was putting up just dirty pictures, which we thought were very sexy.  They're very sexy.  No, they were not.  They're very sexy and very hot.  There was one.  I swear.  They're very sexy when you were getting it combined.  No, they are.  They're very sexy.  Looking back and stuff.  Hey, stop it. 
[03:33:00]  It was nice.  I was saying, they're very sexy.  Yeah.  You're a very pretty girl.  And I didn't mean to, you know...  Those pictures were not...  So you guys picked out, like seriously, like, oh, awesome.  Thanks.  I'm out.  Stop.  Don't...  No.  What happened though?  It's a picture...  Why are you guys doing this?  What?  To be honest, I gotta say, what is wrong?  It's just her sucking on a big black ball bag.  Hey, hey, you guys.  Come on.  Be nice.  No, no, no.  What?  How are you?  Nothing wrong with that.  It's a dirty photo. 
[03:33:30]  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  It's just her sucking on the big ball bag of the black gentleman.  Exactly.  What's wrong with it?  Where did they go?  I can't.  Why?  I can't deal with this situation now.  It's just...  I feel so bad.  I don't.  I never fuck with the girls that come in here.  Never.  Never.  Oh, do I feel terrible.  Yeah, I'll talk to her.  She's here to promote...  Well, you know something.  She's here to promote Penthouse.  Wait, wait, wait.  She looks beautiful on the cover. 
[03:34:00]  Wait.  Fuck these people.  They're assholes.  Oh, shit.  Get them back in here.  They're fucking assholes.  I've never been through to look at this on the radio.  Aww.  You ruined Howard's fucking...  fucking whatever the fuck he calls that insertion machine.  Shut up.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'll be.  I'll be.  Stop it.  Hold on.  That wasn't our intention.  Trust me.  Like, getting to know her and stuff.  And actually, if I dare say, I see a little twinkle in Anthony's eye when he first saw 
[03:34:30]  her.  So he was definitely trying to be even nicer than he would in general.  If you listen to any interview with any girl that's done any adult films from me,  it will be the same question.  Well, I think what she's saying is, you know, she's very proud of, you know, she just  was announced as the pet of the year runner-up and I think that she's...  Sorry.  Yes.  You know what?  I'm getting fucking...  Tell her to fucking leave that or she's not happy.  Oh, Jimmy.  She's really beginning to fucking ask her.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[03:35:00]  Ask her if she's just ashamed of what she's done in her life.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  What's going on, Danny?  You guys are putting me in the middle of a very awkward situation.  I know.  You're really in an awkward situation.  I know.  The first scene was shot with a fucking good friend of mine.  I don't wanna fucking hear this shit.  Sylvarez is a good buddy of mine.  It's getting sensitive.  No one is shittling on her stuff.  I have to leave.  And I don't wanna leave.  You guys, I don't wanna leave.  I know.  I know.  Don't worry about it.  You come back whenever you want.  I know, but I'm saying I don't want to leave just because, you know, the situation went bad. 
[03:35:30]  So don't make her stay.  Oh, I hate being an asshole.  Boo-hoo!  Boo-hoo!  Boo-hoo!  Oh, Jesus.  Boo-hoo!  Please tell her.  Boo-hoo!  Please tell her how.  No, if you go to the autograph signing, please just say how cute she is.  Yeah, just tell her she's cute.  You're cute.  What a cutie patootie.  Use Rosie's.  I'm so embarrassed.  Cutie kids, cutie pie.  I've never seen one of these girls whose skin is thinner than the pages her nude pictures 
[03:36:00]  are on.  Jesus Christ, I know.  Should we have David go in there and try to smooth things over?  Bopey, radio genius, get David with a microphone to smooth things over with his headset.  Just tell him to smooth things over.  David, I want you to go in there and go.  The guys really want you to come back on the show.  Go talk to her.  Smooth things over.  Smooth things over.  Don't just go right with the question.  Get him a fucking headset right now.  Don't just go right with the question.  Smooth things over first.  Just break into the conversation.  Say, you know, agree with her. 
[03:36:30]  David.  David.  Yeah, that might not hurt.  I got it.  I got it.  Oh, yeah.  David.  Go in.  Break up the conversation and go.  The guys want to know when the whore is coming back into the studio.  It's part of the joke, David.  It's part of the joke, David.  Yes.  You know what, David?  We might give you an executive intern stats back.  Okay, don't say whore.  Just say, look.  Okay, no.  Just say when the cute girl is coming back in the studio.  Don't say when you're coming back.  They want to know when the cute girl is coming back in.  What the fuck's wrong with that?  I'll tell you.  Way to go, man.  Way to bring us a head case.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot. 
[03:37:00]  I blame you.  They pushed me out.  I blame you.  You blame me for everything.  All right, well, that's just wonderful.  Maybe I can help.  Look, our people are waiting for something to happen.  Well, they, they, they, trust me, they, they're here for a classic.  They're not stupid.  But you guys are still having fun, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get naked, will ya?  I'm, like, bummed out now.  I don't even.  Here's someone that knows who she is. 
[03:37:30]  Now, go get naked for these guys.  Oh, God.  Opie, Anthony, I don't know.  This is.  I didn't say anything.  You want to talk to Shauna?  I was being really nice.  Anthony, do you want to go talk to her?  Should I?  Go give her a hug or something.  Go say you're sorry and give her a hug.  She'd be okay with that?  Maybe.  Well, grab the, grab the mic so she knows she's on the air.  Grab the mic so she knows she's on the air.  Take the mic there.  Ann's good at this stuff.  Jim, your face.  Okay, no.  I'll be back. 
[03:38:00]  Okay.  All right, no mic.  Anthony, Anthony's talking to her.  Okay.  There's no mic allowed in the room.  Okay.  He's trying to smooth things over.  Right.  Some of her conversation was being picked up by the audience.  It's like, she gave him the dismissive thumbs up and it's just nodding him off and saying,  I know.  Let me see what I can do here.  Oh, it's back.  Wow.  I've never seen you look like this before.  What happened?  Did you just see a psychopath? 
[03:38:30]  That didn't go well.  What happened?  What happened?  Well, I punched her.  No, I just kind of explained, you know, the situation.  Yeah.  Were you sensitive, Anthony?  Hi.  I love when Anthony gets sensitive.  He's like, hi.  Were you just trying to?  Well, I was just trying to smooth things over, you know, but there's not much smoothing  going to be done.  I don't want to smooth it over.  What'd she say to you?  Nothing.  It was mostly hand signals.  Really? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  God, you were being...  Different fingers.  I swear to everyone out there.  It was being so nice.  He actually...  I...  He was actually, like, attracted to her.  Like...  Well, I think she's a pretty girl.  Of course, you'd have to be nuts not to think, you know...  No, but I mean, it was a little more than that.  She fucking annoyed me so much.  She fucking annoyed me a lot.  But, Jimmy, you get annoyed at girls like that because you're so used to, you know,  having to pay them.  Oh, stop it!  No, the girls that come in, especially the penthouse girls, and I'm not even just saying 
[03:39:30]  that because you're...  The penthouse girls are universally fucking great.  Like, there's been no issue.  They're all fucking cool.  Uh-huh.  That's the first one I can think of, whether it was Justine Jolie or fucking Victoria's  Drucker or fucking Brie Olsen or yourself.  They're all cool.  Thank you.  Yeah.  But her, she's the first one that was like, what?  Take my shirt?  Why?  I didn't want to press my tits up.  What?  Like, what are we doing?  You don't know how to fun on a radio show?  You're completely naked.  What do you think you're going to do?  Just talk about the cover?  Well, here's a magazine. 
[03:40:00]  And that's going to entertain fucking a million-something people listening.  It doesn't make sense.  Well, maybe she's, you know, not as comfortable with what she has to do or is doing as the  other girls that were...  How about this?  It's a fiercely competitive business.  You want to fucking sell magazines?  You got to promote...  How do you think you're getting people to buy fucking paper magazines in a computer internet  world?  You got to go on the radio and talk about it and make people like you and want to see you.  What do you think?  You're going to say, hi, I'm on the cover and anybody's going to give a shit? 
[03:40:30]  Well, I think that was part of the problem is, you know, she wanted to promote the paper  thing and there was the old internet.  Yeah, but you know what?  Oh, Jesus.  I was also talking...  Oh, God damn you, Danny.  That's hot.  She wouldn't like this one.  Wow.  We were talking about the fucking...  She did a penthouse video.  That's all part of penthouse.  What's the fucking problem?  All right, shut up.  I'm watching the video.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we get it in?  Lainey's got to get her out of here because we got to...  Oh, boy.  Lainey's very good.  We like Lainey a lot.  Very much.  She does a lot for this radio show. 
[03:41:00]  Holy mackerel.  Maybe she's mad because she's never recovered from that.  She's coming out.  Okay, she's coming out.  All right.  Everybody boo.  Boo-hoo!  Boo-hoo!  Bye!  Bye!  Bye!  I hope everything works out okay.  Where's she now?  Holy fuck!  It's amazing.  That doesn't make her cry.  There's a giant penis in her hiney.  It looks like the fucking Titanic going into the Lincoln. 
[03:41:30]  Speaking of Lincoln.  I know.  That video makes you realize the mistake.  She was making out with some broad on Howard's show yesterday.  Oh, screw.  Oh, was she really?  What's up, Steve?  I was going to ask.  You know what?  Oh, you weren't there?  I was going to ask.  Was she upset after yesterday's show that she did with Star?  Lainey was very apologetic, first of all, because Lainey has...  We have extensive conversations before the girls ever come on. 
[03:42:00]  They know exactly what they're walking into.  They do.  She actually gives us, like, a breakdown of every show we're going to do and what is to  be expected on the show.  And it says...  We weren't even doing it.  I know.  I know.  And Taya's last appearance was fucking huge.  It's all over the goddamn internet now.  And, you know, and it went perfectly.  And Lainey's baffled by this.  And she's very apologetic because she wasn't expecting this because her appearance...  Who could have?  She said...  I think it actually says...  I actually have my paper in there that breaks down, like, what the show is.  And she said it's a dude show. 
[03:42:30]  It's guys being guys.  And they're going to kind of be raunchy.  And so we definitely know everything we're walking into every time we go on to every  show.  Because Lainey is very thorough about that kind of thing.  It's the worst of 2009.  I'm getting deuce chills.  So far.  On the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 so far for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock.  Now, I got to take some time here for myself for this segment because it needs a little 
[03:43:00]  bit of an introduction.  Yes.  This segment involves a very well-known rap persona.  That's true.  We were fortunate enough to have him in the studio.  And it just became its own when primetime Sam Roberts came into the mix.  Well, it's true.  This is a person who now I'm starting to build a relationship with in a major, major way.  I think you're actually part of the G-Unit.  Of course I am.  And of course we are talking about the leader of the G-Unit.  The one and only 50 Cent's.  Uh, Cent.  Cent. 
[03:43:30]  Cent.  50's Cent.  You kind of need to know that if you're going to wear his clothing.  50's Cent?  Yes.  It's 50's Cent.  Who is in studio advertising his cologne.  50 Cent.  50's Cent.  Well, whoever he is, he was here.  And he had fun with us.  He was very nice and he had a video game.  That's true.  Blood in the Sand is 50 Cent promotes it.  Only here on the worst of Opie and Anthony, the worst of 2009 so far.  You're listening to the worst.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool. 
[03:44:00]  No, not at all.  Yeah, because it's a piece of shit.  What's going on?  Y'all look there early in the morning, man.  Oh, it sucks.  Believe me.  Just look at me like why I'm so energetic.  It's no, uh, it's no treat to wake up early.  No, not at all.  We're checking out the video game.  It looks great, man.  It looks great.  This looks so goddamn cool.  How do you get out of this?  We're trying to get out of this room so we can get into the strip club and he's just running,  he's just shooting himself and shooting through the bars and not getting out.  We just want to go into the strip club and check out the...  You just want to go to the strip club?  Yeah, we want to check out the broads and the strip club.  See some eyes.  I'm still finding myself around the game, too. 
[03:44:30]  Do you play video games?  Yeah, I do.  My son is just a fanatic right now.  I mean, I guess it's where I was at at that age.  I was 12, you know, I was crazy.  That's when it was, you know, one joystick, one button.  Yeah, right.  The old Atari game.  ColecoVision.  Was there things that you wanted to do in the game that they said no?  Was there anything you suggested?  They go, like, oh, no, we can't put that in a row and get sold?  You know what I learned?  I learned to let the people who actually do it take the lead.  Yeah.  Like, I walked into the room, because Bulletproof, I had so much input that the game didn't 
[03:45:00]  come out as good as it could have.  And I said, this time I came in and I was like, yo, hold on a second.  I'm going to listen.  What is the best possible things that we can actually do?  And I kind of let the guys do what they do, and then I added my input to it.  Like, the environment is the way it is, because, like, two years ago, when I first I started  with Vivendi Universal, and then they merged with Activision, and now I'm with THQ.  But when we actually, when I went and sat with them, I had an opportunity to see Blood 
[03:45:30]  Diamond.  Yeah, yeah.  And to see, I went to perform for the Soldiers in Iraq.  So I kind of took both of those things.  That's what inspired me to be a part of the film project, Home of the Brave.  It was myself, Samuel Jackson, Jessica Biel.  I had a great director on that project.  It was Irwin Winkler.  You know, and from that, like, that's what, because this is the most intense situation  you could possibly be in.  Like, when you've been through some tough periods in your life, you can feel like you've  been through it until you get there and you realize that they made a conscious decision 
[03:46:00]  to be in a life-threatening situation.  And that's got to be mentally a lot tougher than what is out there.  Like, you don't make choices.  Somebody just runs up on you in the street.  Were you scared of being over there?  I went over there, we did shows in the end of 2003, and then they started beheading  people.  And I wouldn't know.  No, it was crazy over there.  I was scared to go back over.  Yo, look, the first thing you said to me is, look, I'm not going to bullshit you.  You can die today.  So when I got out of the car, I was like, what the fuck did I come here for?  Yeah, right. 
[03:46:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Like, I couldn't have went to Dubai.  That was my day, like, time off that I said, let me go do that with the soldiers.  You know what I'm saying?  And I come here, you're going to tell me, you're not going to bullshit me.  You could die today.  Damn.  You know, but it's interesting.  I know the people that I saw there weren't the same people their loved ones miss here.  Because your spirit would absolutely have to change to have that much death around you.  If you come into a platoon of 45 people, and then now it's 30, and then it's 26.  Yeah, there's a lot of guys you know.  Yeah, and then it's 20.  So then those guys are writing death notes.  Like, if I actually pass away, send this note to my family. 
[03:47:00]  You know, because they see people moving around them.  Now, putting a strip club in Iraq, that was definitely a stretch.  You had to get one there.  The champion was.  I absolutely needed that.  The motivation.  I mean, like, what is your motivation?  I said, what is my motivation, man?  Are you able in this?  Because, like, in GTA, I mean, this has got the same level of graphics as Grand Theft Auto  as far as believability.  And the shooting is great, because when someone gets shot in this, the blood actually splashes  behind and sprays the wall. 
[03:47:30]  Are you able to shoot civilians in this, too?  Because in GTA, you could just shoot anything that walks.  Yeah, you can.  It's like, what's the name?  They've got the same engine as Gears of War.  Yeah.  Oh, it has Gears of War engine.  Gears of War is good.  You're definitely involved in the business end of a lot of what's out there that is marketed  as 50 Cent, as you.  Do you have to tread a fine line between keeping your credibility with especially your original  fans and being a businessman?  Well, for me, it's my personal growth as I get into different things. 
[03:48:00]  But you've got to take some shit from people.  They've got people that's going to hate you for whatever you do, you know what I mean?  And they're not even being conscious of the actual business.  Right.  See, the guy who was in hip-hop 10 years ago, if he had the same morals and the things that  they consider would give you street credibility and everything, he's completely broke right  now.  Yeah.  It's a VH1 special.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You watch that Hammett special, man. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, that hurts.  Yeah.  Like, it's crazy.  That's an eye-opener.  Because he didn't understand brand extension.  Uh-huh.  When the business is changing and the marketing dollars are changing.  So, if the company can't see the same returns off the CD sales, which we know obviously isn't  the same, they can't spend the same marketing dollars they could on presenting you to the  public as a star.  But who turned you on to vitamin water?  Like, who would think to get into that?  And what a payday you got from vitamin water.  Initially, vitamin water for me, it's so basic, man.  Like, I went in the Walmart, the no-frills section, like, they had toilet paper for 29 
[03:49:00]  cents.  So, I was like, yo, how much is this cost to make?  It's got to be, like, nothing, right?  Yeah, it has to be 9 cents.  They're selling it for 29 cents, right?  Like, you know, and then I'm like, I just want to take three of these, put it in a wrapper  with a different brand and move it to the middle of the aisle.  And sell it for 50 cents.  You know what I'm saying?  Holy crap.  That's all I want to do.  That's all you did.  You know what I'm saying?  So, when you're looking at that, like, initially, look at spring water.  You got Poland Spring in the same section for, like, $2.89. 
[03:49:30]  And then you got 59, the same gallon of water for 59 cents.  And they say, this is spring water, too.  Yeah, what's the difference?  So, I'm like, I don't know the difference.  Me, I'm like, they're both spring water.  It's two different things.  It's just which brand are you going to actually pay for.  So, I'm saying, like, I wanted to actually go into, I just wanted to move the spring water  from 59 cents to a dollar.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, there had to be a bigger profit margin.  If I could just take 59 cents more off of what they already have, and they got that profit point selling it at 59 cents. 
[03:50:00]  If I could just move it into the middle and then spend marketing dollars to brand it.  And he's thinking of all this shit when the store manager's following him around the store.  Around the store, saying what?  Saying, I have a carbon bite.  Carbon bite.  Exactly.  Carbon bite.  So, then I explored the possibilities.  The vitamin water thing, I came across it in Los Angeles, in the gym, working out.  And, you know, I was looking for a supplement for soda. 
[03:50:30]  And, I mean, they had so much water that it just, like, I felt like I wasn't.  After a while, you'd be looking like, I don't want that.  I want soda.  I want sugar.  Sure.  You know, and then that was the thing that I had in between all of the water that I had while I was training.  And then, you know, I did the research.  It was a private-owned company based in Queens.  And they was providing stock options for their employees to create incentive for them because it was private-owned.  And then they allowed me.  When I came in, I bought equity from individuals. 
[03:51:00]  Because people who go to work live in the now.  They say, well, if I sell this, I can move.  Junior can have his own room.  And we can get a new car now.  And, you know, they spend the money before they actually get the money once they know someone's willing to buy it.  And then, you know, they sell it.  How did you get educated as far as the business end goes?  Because there aren't many people that are that, you know, streetwise.  And also, I mean, you've been in the shit earlier in your days.  We've all heard the stories. 
[03:51:30]  When did that happen where you, you know, now you're talking fucking, like, stock options and shit.  Well, it's a lot of new information coming at the same time.  But if you've always actually wanted those opportunities and didn't have the finances or generate the interest that allow you to be involved in those deals,  when the opportunities come, you absorb it and you learn.  Like, New York City is a million.  When the nighttime comes on, every light is representation of a great idea that has no finances to support it.  Yeah.  You see what I'm saying?  Wait, did you say that again?  Because I'm completely lost. 
[03:52:00]  I said, tonight, when the sun goes down, every light in New York City is representation of a great idea that doesn't have finances to support it.  So a lot of people have good ideas.  They just don't have the finances or the energy around them to make someone else come in and actually support it with the finances.  So there's, you know, there's a chance.  You're taking, obviously, a chance with your backing with the money.  Yeah.  But then you've got to make kind of an educated choice.  Absolutely.  If you want to invest in something.  The vitamin water was a great idea. 
[03:52:30]  That's not just all 50 cents.  The public just sees me, but they don't see my attorneys.  There you go.  And the team of people that I send to do due diligence on the companies that I associate myself with.  I'd love to see them because mine fucking stink.  They got me involved in the stock market five months ago.  Wow.  Five months ago.  It's a great time.  That's true.  Can we tell people what the Rick Rush thing is, too?  Because there's, like, a conflict with another rapper.  And you, Bobby, turned me on.  What you did was what everybody would want to do.  Right.  The guy was, I guess, what was he, just shit-talking you for nothing?  Yeah, he just came pretty much because his album's going to come.  He looked for additional publicity by, you know, saying different things. 
[03:53:00]  And then he called me Curly.  And when you call me Curly, it's like, you know, like Moe Larry and Curly.  He called me Curly.  I said, well, I'm going to turn, I created this character called Pippin' Curly.  You know, and then I started creating these webisodes that happen every other, like, every week.  And it's generating millions and millions of hits.  But you're really embarrassing him because this guy came out and it was, I guess he started something.  And so what you do is, you come on and you go, I'm going to fuck up your life. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Which is really going to be unpleasant to hear.  But the seriousness where you went, you know what, nobody tells, I have no bosses.  And I've decided, you actually made a decision to do it.  To fuck up, you said, I'm going to fuck your life up.  Because I'm saying to you right now, I have 90% of my project completed.  The only reason why it's not 100% completed is because I have to wait for Dre to be complete what he's doing with Em in Detroit before I can have him to focus on everything else to mix the last few pieces of my actual album. 
[03:54:00]  So Em's album will end up coming out first now because he'll be done by the time I get my hands on Dre.  So I make good music away from him, but when me and Dre are together, it's something organically happens that I want to see happen on this project.  So I'll wait.  I'll be patient.  So while you do that, this guy decides to jump out there at a time that I have idle time. 
[03:54:30]  I will fuck you up.  I have disposable cash.  I will sit there and figure out how to fuck your life up.  Now you got time to give it a little thought.  He said I have disposable cash to fuck another human being's life up.  This is crazy.  I mean, you picked the wrong time.  Bad, bad time.  So if you had stuff to do, you'd be like, ah, you'd let it go.  Yeah, I mean, but I tapped him and just kept it moving.  But now I'm going to beat his ass.  Jimmy, get into what he did.  But it's not, it's the stuff you'd want to do because immediately you think, all right, there's two rappers going at it. 
[03:55:00]  One, there's going to be a problem.  This is just embarrassing shit.  He takes the guy's ex-girlfriend, the mother of the guy's son's mother, flies her in and takes her and her girlfriend out.  On a shopping spree.  Yeah, he wasn't doing it.  He wasn't doing it.  Somebody got to do it.  Yeah, but you had her, you interviewed her like a talk show.  Yeah, you see me very serious.  You were so serious.  It was like a regular talk.  It was like Charlie Rose.  He was so serious.  He would ask her a question and then he would look right into the camera and just let her answer about him not paying child support. 
[03:55:30]  But his jewelry, his jewelry's rented.  He loves this.  This guy's a joke.  I mean, you see before to the highest level.  Like I've seen a lot of guys to the highest level.  Like this guy's the biggest fraud we've seen thus far.  Like if you go from, like the guy was a correctional officer and he writes from the perspective of the biggest drug dealer in Miami. 
[03:56:00]  Now we know Miami is a port when it comes through there and we know how, you know, people like the way they love Scarface.  His infatuation with that guy, he done created this new character.  Actually, the guy named that he took, Rick Ross, Freeway Rick, he gets out next month.  18 years.  You know he's going to be knocking on his door.  I just take my name, motherfucker.  Yeah.  He gets out next month.  And you're a correctional officer and you decide to stop working corrections in order to go rap as if you're the biggest drug dealer in Miami. 
[03:56:30]  But you had a photo of him.  You had a photo of him when he got his diploma as a corrections officer shaking this white, this old white woman's hand.  And he's got the biggest shit-eating grin.  Like, I did it, mom.  I did it, mom.  But he doesn't, he doesn't fit in his outfit either.  That's amazing.  I mean, didn't he have to know if he decided I don't dress good?  I think I dress good.  No one in here is going to argue.  Why not you're going to argue?  He said, oh, don't you worry about it.  He said, I didn't dress good. 
[03:57:00]  And then he mentioned Gucci, Mr. Metz.  All of these high-end brands.  Well, we know that they got European cut.  He can't fit in none of that shit.  He got a shop in big and tall.  You know what I'm saying?  He had a picture of his mom, too, that was fucked up.  He actually said, he had a picture of him with his mom.  But it was one of those photos they were eating.  They just were eating at a table.  And he's clumped.  Yeah.  And the clump.  He goes, look, he looks like the nutty professor. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Crazy.  Can I ask you, with all the attention you're giving him, does that help him?  Well, it doesn't.  You don't think it does?  Because they always say, you know, even bad publicity is good.  Yeah, bad publicity is good when you, not at a time when you actually, your material isn't generating energy.  Right, because I don't, I didn't know the guy's name until today.  Right.  So what happens is, you're aware of him, so you're going to notice his record sales are super low.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Because it's not enough for you to go buy his record, because you didn't hear a song that made you feel like you should be interested. 
[03:58:00]  You just heard he was talking to 50.  So at the end of the day, like, the record sales come in and they go, wow, so you really suck.  You saw like 30,000 records.  Oof.  Get out of here.  Now, with shit like this, pulling stuff like that, obviously, you know, especially from past events and things that have happened,  you got to kind of be concerned that somebody's going to snap and take a shot at you.  You know, ever since Biggie and Tupac had their issues, it altered the entire art form. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  Because hip hop is, the competitive nature of the art form, it always had battling as a part of the culture.  You know what I'm saying?  And if you got someone that isn't intelligent enough to draw lines, then we're in danger.  Yeah.  You see what I'm saying?  Like, if you got people to cross those actual, those barriers in their spaces, then you got issues.  But do you know people that, you know, you could completely fuck with and they won't, they won't do anything? 
[03:59:00]  And then do you know other people that it's like, me, better, yeah, this guy will fucking get a shot at me.  I'm the guy, you're the guy, you're the guy, you're the guy, you're the guy, you're the guy.  Yeah, that's obvious.  Him, you fucking idiot.  What are you talking about?  Unlimited expenses.  You know, I mean, you've been shot.  I mean, it's, you know, you get to talk to many people who have actually, you know, who for all intents and purposes shouldn't have made it.  And you got shot more than once.  Yeah.  And here you are, you know, and you do a hundred million dollars with vitamins.  It's like, do you ever look at your life and go like, why the fuck did this happen?  Or how is this?  See, look, I know I'm crazy, right? 
[03:59:30]  Because I know that I, I convinced myself that these things were going to happen long before anything came to pass.  So, like, my grandparents look at me like, okay, we understand now, but I was, like, I was absolutely crazy to them.  Like, I was, I got shot, I came back, I lost my record deal, everything, I'm not at Columbia anymore, and I'm by the radio mumbling.  Wait, did Columbia just pull the deal because they just didn't talk to me anymore?  Okay.  Like, after that, I got shot.  So, I was, like, I'm, I'm by the radio mumbling, but what I'm mumbling is get rich or die trying. 
[04:00:00]  You see what I'm saying?  So, my, to my grandparents at that point, while I'm there, it's like, poor baby, you know, he had a shot out of it.  He almost, he had something.  You know, but for me, I, I can't, I don't take no as an answer.  When you come from where I come from, there ain't no plan B.  You got to make it.  You see what I'm saying?  So, a lot of other people, they'll, they'll create the excuses.  Mm-hmm.  They'll create reasoning for why they're not supposed to make it in their lives because they don't have things. 
[04:00:30]  Like, if you grew up in a household with one parent, a single parent, where I'm from, that happens so common that you can't use that as an excuse.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  You can't, you can't use minor things like that.  Like, so you lose a leg, so what?  You get a chair and go.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, you don't, I don't care.  The rest of the world doesn't either.  You could just look at, like, everything that's happened in your past and say, like, that brought you where you are now.  Absolutely.  And educated you to bring you to where you are now. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  So, there's no, there's no real looking back and regretting anything.  No regrets at all.  No regrets?  You know what I think?  I think the things you go through make you who you are and shape you as a person.  So, those experiences allow me to become what I am now.  And I look at, you know when you, when you, when you say, um, where you're headed?  Like, I have no idea.  I'm going through a tunnel that doesn't end.  My ambition is leading me so many different places that who knows where I'm going to end up.  You know what I mean?  When you're getting, when something like that's happening and you're in the process and someone's shooting at you and it's hitting you, what, what are you thinking? 
[04:01:30]  You're scared.  You just, you're going to die maybe.  Yeah, you're going to die.  Like, any other, it's a life-threatening situation.  So, I mean, and anybody, those things change you because either you become, when you're hurt as bad, somebody halfway killed you, it hurts.  You get shot nine times, you're hurt bad, your hip is fractured, you can't even sit in the chair straight.  So, from there, either your fear consumes you or you become a little insensitive.  Like somebody who survives a plane crash.  You know what I'm saying?  And you, yeah, I mean, those type of things happen and then you have to assess life and death, even though we know it's our fate, all of us in this room. 
[04:02:00]  We know we're going to die at some point because humans are habit forming and we look forward to the future.  We push that to the back of our minds and still concentrate on saving money for tomorrow.  Right.  You know what I mean?  But in all reality, we're going to go, all of us.  Fuck Tony Robbins.  You should put out a fucking self-help.  Yeah, motivation speaker right here.  Listen up, motherfuckers.  Hey, as a businessman, how's the portfolio? 
[04:02:30]  Did you get hit?  Well, like the rest of us?  Everybody.  I think everybody.  I mean, I think if you had enough.  Did you beat up your broker?  Well, no, but I made adjustments.  You know what I'm saying?  Moved some motherfucking money around.  I mean, if they tell you they didn't make, if they didn't take any losses, they didn't make enough money.  There you go.  Like adjustments, like Pesci did in Casino.  I want that money back that I invested.  Well, we can't do that.  I'd like it back.  I'm going to knock your fucking head off.  Do you worry about, you trust everybody that's around you? 
[04:03:00]  You keep an eye on your finances and shit like that?  Well, my circle is getting a lot smaller.  Is it?  Yeah.  Of just people that surround me anyway.  Did you notice there were people that were just kind of, you know?  You know what it is?  Is you have, you develop a comfort with people that you know.  Or you feel like you know.  But their intentions change.  Right.  Because people every day, they're not the same person.  I had my son's mom know for 13 years.  So I woke up one day, she decided we was enemies.  You know what I mean?  It's like how many, 53% of the people who get married get divorced. 
[04:03:30]  Right.  And I'm sure that there's one side of that party that really don't, listen, we don't have  to get divorced, do we?  You know what I'm saying?  I'm just going to split up half of everything I've earned at that point.  I'm sure that there would be a compromise on some levels if they could just come to that,  you know, to that actual medium.  But the other person is like, no, I'm going to go.  Give me my half.  And that's it.  You know what I'm saying?  So, I mean, it creates a phobia financially.  I think we conditioned ourselves without even being conscious of it.  Like a little boy, we're going to give him a car. 
[04:04:00]  The car is actually on the street right now.  So, what does that car equate to?  Finances.  Because you've got to get the money to get the car that he's actually playing with.  If it's a Tyco truck, then it's saying work.  Because it's saying construction.  If it has to say in gas, if it's a fire truck, it's saying be a fireman when you get older.  And then a little girl, before she grows into being a little girl, when she's still a baby,  we give her a baby.  Yeah.  We give her a house.  We give her a cooking set.  So, we teach in a nurturing and actually groom the family at home. 
[04:04:30]  These are traditions that we already have.  Like when a woman should take care of the home and the man should, you know, be the breadwinner.  Wow.  In different ways.  And we're not even, like a lot of people are not even conscious of it.  But we do those things.  We went to the premiere of Righteous Kill and we saw, we were sitting actually in front of Erwin Winkler.  So, we saw you having a nice gentlemanly chat.  And I'm like, I knew he was somebody.  I didn't know who he was.  I don't recognize him.  But you got up and, you know, just chit-chatting with him and his wife. 
[04:05:00]  And, you know, Erwin Winkler doesn't look like the type of guy that hangs out with 50 cents.  You know, picture them two in a car together.  You did scenes with Pacino and De Niro together.  I mean, you're not nervous rapping.  Are you terrified doing that?  Because my acting is shit.  I mean, it's a loaded experience.  Definitely when you're with someone that's that great.  Their choices have been what we've been watching for, like, decades.  I mean, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro don't get no better than that.  Why do you think hip-hop artists translate so well into acting?  Not all of them.  I've seen some shit. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, but, like, some of them, some of us develop a comfort that allows you to be in front of the camera.  I'm in front of the camera so often.  Like, we're here right now.  You're taping me.  Don't mind.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  And you just relax and be yourself in front of it in different ways.  But, I mean, acting is a whole other thing.  It's a study of human behavior.  You watch other people and kind of take things from it.  It makes you more observant.  Even when I watch a film, I see it differently now because I see the shot.  I see how they shot the scene instead of just watching the film.  Before, it would just be sit and look. 
[04:06:00]  Right, right, right.  Just watching it as a spectator.  Because I know that it took 45 minutes for them to go ahead and change the lights and they wouldn't set the lines again from a different angle.  It was like, you know, so it changes the whole process.  Do you get tired of all the emphasis put on, because I'm sure you don't, you and I flew together one time.  I'm sure.  I know.  We took a flight together to Cancun.  We sat next to each other and we just chit-chatted about the FCC.  And then I got, you know, I just shame-spiraled and ran out of things to say. 
[04:06:30]  I sounded like a fucking idiot.  You were being very engaging.  Sort of like now?  No, but I mean, I was actually surprised he was so, like, you know, soft-spoken, nice dude.  Do you remember him?  I don't remember that.  Thank you.  You know, what I do is, though, is I maintain a general respect for everybody, regardless of because you don't know how important the person is you're talking to.  Well, in that case, the person you're talking to is not particularly important.  No, but what I'm saying is, like, I don't know when I'm going to run into them.  Right.  Or what that person actually does.  You could be somebody that I need in the future to help me move to the next level. 
[04:07:00]  And if you don't show that courtesy and respect.  Like, I've had the same situation happen, and the president of Lionsgate was sitting across from me in the actual airplane,  and I didn't know he was the president of Lionsgate until I got to that point where I'm meeting him.  But I recognized him from there.  I said, yo, did you ever, did we ride on a plane from New York to Los Angeles?  And he said, yeah.  And I remember it because he got a head full of white hair.  Like, his whole hair is, like, white.  So he was one of those guys that you look at and go, how the fuck does that happen? 
[04:07:30]  You're either really old or something scared the shit out of you.  So we were talking about the FCC and how hard it was to get videos and stuff done,  and you were saying that there was all these problems that they were giving hip-hop with content.  How tired are you to have to explain, you understand, like, it's not your responsibility or my responsibility to raise people's family for them.  And how frustrating is that as a performer?  I think that, you know, they'll ask in different positions. 
[04:08:00]  They'll ask the craziest questions.  They'll try to place the weirdest responsibilities on entertainment.  You know what I mean?  Like, the pro athlete, because, you know, their kids want to be those pro athletes and join them, they create dress codes.  Yeah.  Now you got to wear a suit.  Period.  You know what I'm saying?  But a lot of these guys come from environments that come from not having.  So their tattoos read the same as mine's.  When they get on a court, you see things that reflect the same energy and the mentality that lives where I actually come from. 
[04:08:30]  But they got to wear a suit because it's mandatory now.  It's got to be ridiculous.  I know you had a problem with the billboard, with the guns in your hand, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  When I was doing Get Riches, I tried.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know what it is?  There's standards that are completely acceptable in different art forms.  Like, if I mentioned 007.  Right.  What do you think of?  The logo is the gun pointed at you. 
[04:09:00]  Yeah.  If you think of Rambo, what is the highlight in that?  What, Terminator?  All of these things, the gun is the star of the actual film.  Yeah.  You see what I'm saying?  So when you actually, those things are acceptable in film to utilize for marketing purposes.  When you think of, even, wasn't it, at the time it was Angelina and Brad was in the same movie.  Mr. Smith, and they had the guns out at the same time, and nobody had an issue with that. 
[04:09:30]  And the problem is, they look at me and says, no, you don't understand.  He fucking has that gun right now.  You know what I'm saying?  You might.  I mean, it's true.  We're certainly all wondering.  It's like Spielberg went back and took the guns.  He, uh, they competed in PT, and they put walkie-talkies in the agency's hands, so they wouldn't have guns enough already.  How upset were you when McCain lost?  Were you upset about that?  I wasn't.  You were upset about that.  Okay, I mean, but I was like, there's low taxes to be low, but. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's my big beef.  I'm just like, you know.  You're listening to the worst of 2009 so far on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  I feel a hunger, it's a hunger, that tries to keep a man awake at night.  Are you the answer?  I shouldn't wonder.  When I feel you wet my appetite. 
[04:10:30]  With all the power you're releasing, it isn't safe to walk the city streets alone.  Anticipation is running through me.  Let's find the key and turn this engine on.  I can feel you breathe.  I can feel your heartbeat faster.  Take me home tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light. 
[04:11:00]  Take me home tonight.  Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  Be my little baby.  Oh, oh.  Just like Ronnie sang.  I say, just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby. 
[04:11:30]  Baby, my darling.  Oh, oh, oh.  I feel a hunger.  It's a hunger.  Take me home tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light.  Take me home tonight.  Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang.  Well, that was the worst of 2009 so far, and what a year it's been. 
[04:12:00]  Well, it hasn't been a full year.  That's why it's so far.  It's just been about five months, six months.  But so far, it's been one hell of a year.  It seems like it's been a year as long as it's taken.  Yes.  No.  The answer was time flies.  Oh.  So it has not seemed like a year.  It seemed like a month.  I thought the answer was the year of primetime.  I can't believe 2009 is already half over.  I know.  It's like, whoa.  But we've managed to sneak in so many marquee bits.  I just, I don't see any end to this Opie and Anthony train.  What's next for the show, then? 
[04:12:30]  Well, here's what I think.  I'm going to be the Ryan Seacrest of Sirius Radio.  I'm going to be all over the place.  You can have every paycheck.  I have every paycheck.  Everyone's paycheck is coming to me.  Mm-hmm.  But I'll always stay loyal to the Opie and Anthony show.  But I'm taking everyone's pay.  What can I be here at Sirius?  You can be the other Ryan from American Idol season one.  That is exactly correct.  That's not what I want to be.  I'm taking everyone's money.  I did not grow up to be that.  I'm taking everyone's money.  Everyone's money.  Wow.  Everyone's been put on notice. 
[04:13:00]  I'm taking your money.  If anyone's out there listening, works for Sirius XM, I'm taking your money.  Even the...  Yeah.  Wow.  Everyone's money.  That's a lot of zeros.  If you're broadcast on satellite radio, I'm taking your money.  All of it.  Then I don't owe you five bucks anymore.  There you go.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  I'm taking all your money.  This has been the worst of 2009 so far for the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you for listening.  I have been E-Rock.  That has been Primetime Sam Roberts.  And it's all mine, baby.  All your money.  All those $12.95 a month subscriptions, all straight to me. 
[04:13:30]  I'm taking your money.  We'll see you at 6 a.m.  Bye.  Taking your cash.  No!  No!  And that's the worst.  The worst.  What the fuck is it with you?  Of Opie and Anthony.  Are you professional or not?  Listen to Opie and Anthony live at uncensored weekday mornings from 6 to 11 a.m.  Oh, good for you!  The virus.  Sirius 197.  197 X. </pre>
