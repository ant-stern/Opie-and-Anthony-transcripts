<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of a severe illness sweeping their office, particularly affecting Earl, who was hospitalized with violent symptoms including vomiting and bloody stools.  The hosts humorously speculated on the cause, inventing names like "Thrax" and "Snifleys," before moving on to a conversation about outdated names like "Adolf" and "Mildred" and a description of a gingerbread house made by a "Frenchie" in the studio.  Anthony then recounted a disastrous Amtrak trip from Boston, plagued by delays and poor communication. This prompted numerous caller accounts of negative experiences with Amtrak and Greyhound, featuring colourful descriptions of fellow passengers ranging from pimps and prostitutes to intoxicated individuals. One caller even detailed a week-long Greyhound journey from Los Angeles to New York with his brother, involving police encounters and a suitcase of marijuana.

The conversation shifted to the Middle East conflict, specifically Israel's response to suicide bombings and the targeting of Yasser Arafat's helicopter, as well as an American Taliban member flushed from a basement. A caller criticized the hosts for their lighthearted approach to the situation. Jim Norton then shared a frustrating experience with his broken Palm Pilot, sparking further discussion about technology's shortcomings and more unusual bus ride stories. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine, the house band, performed throughout the show, interspersed with the hosts' riffs on Donald Rumsfeld's press conferences, the New York Jets, and the upcoming "What the Hell Is That?" segment featuring a doctor examining unusual growths on callers.  The comedic banter between the hosts and Richard Cheese continued throughout their musical interludes.

The show then focused on the upcoming "homeless shopping spree" segment, with the hosts discussing the strategy of selecting appropriately destitute and dishevelled participants, recalling past sprees featuring a memorable character named Ziggy known for his smell and rendition of "Silent Night."  Richard Cheese's band performed again, including a controversial rendition of "Rape Me."  A caller described witnessing underage girls engaging in explicit acts on a school bus. A mock feud between Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather, involving violent fantasies, was also enacted. A call from Earl, still in the emergency room, provided further comedic fodder.  The hosts frequently promoted their live shows at the Mercury Lounge and Trocadero.

A segment heavily featured Earl's hospitalization, focusing on graphic jokes about rectal probes, a potential ulcer, and an upcoming stomach scope. A listener congratulated Earl on losing his virginity, leading to more ribbing.  Discussion of ulcer causes included input from a biology major listener on *Helicobacter pylori*. Blind Dave called in, sharing his recent back surgery and pain medication experiences, resulting in more off-color jokes. A song about colonoscopies, "The Pipe Song," was played, but portions were cut due to offensive content. The conversation shifted to a missed moment of silence for George Harrison, followed by discussion of the band's performance at Travis Barker's wedding and his wife's attractiveness.  Stalker Patty arrived in the studio, her dishevelled appearance, unusual toes, and request for money becoming the focal point.  The hosts teased her extensively about her appearance, job history, and financial situation, revealing Jim Norton secretly gave her money during a commercial break.  Details of her foster care background and deceased parents emerged before the hosts ultimately gave her money.  The segment concluded with promotions for upcoming shows and the "What the Hell is That?" segment.

The final segment discussed the fallout from repeatedly pranking Mr. DVD, who subsequently refused further appearances.  The "Homeless Shopping Spree" was heavily promoted again, including graphic descriptions of anticipated antics involving Ziggy. A listener shared a disturbing anecdote about witnessing a homeless assault.  The reading of Mr. DVD's email and listener calls during a "What Did We Learn" segment, filled with crude humor and inside jokes, punctuated the show. New York State Police and Fire Department representatives briefly appeared to promote a benefit lacrosse game.  Ben, a producer, was mentioned, but no other guests beyond the hosts and Richard Cheese were explicitly in-studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, a couple phone numbers real fast in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else,  please give us a call, use 866-277-4-WOW, that's 866-277-4-WOW, what's going on Anthony? 
[00:00:30]  Ah, not too much, how was the trip back from Boston?  You know, I decided this time, going up to Boston, I wasn't feeling very well, you know,  I had the cold thing cranking last week, so I decided...  Oh, by the way, you spread it to everyone in the office.  Yes.  Jim Norton's sick.  Avenger of death. 
[00:01:00]  I love it.  Our own Ken Stevens.  Yes, good.  The only radio show that likes Ken Stevens, Opie and Anthony.  He's now sick.  Sometimes.  Earl is gravely ill.  And Earl has Ebola because of you.  I don't know how I gave Earl Ebola, but Earl gravely ill.  Well, actually, this is probably the first day of work he has missed in years, if ever,  if ever, here at this radio station.  And he is indeed, no joke, in the hospital, crapping blood and puking blood. 
[00:01:30]  Puking and crapping blood.  We're trying to figure out exactly where he is and what room he's in.  I think he's checking in or something.  He's all messed up.  And we'll have to get him on the phone to see what's going on.  Because what happened to him?  Over the weekend, he just got sicker and sicker.  If you remember, he puked when Patty was getting her toes sucked on Friday.  Oh, my God.  Her hammer-toed disgusting toenail. 
[00:02:00]  I almost forgot about that.  Thanks, Anthony.  So, it turns out he was throwing up then.  And then, I guess, over the weekend, it just got worse and worse.  And, you know, I hate to bring up the Thrax, but, you know, he might have the Thrax.  Does he have the Snifleys?  I don't know.  Ask him if he's Snifling.  I don't think he's Snifling.  If he's Snifling, no anthrax.  He didn't even know where he was.  He didn't know what the hell was going on.  He is a mess.  He was like that all weekend.  He just started getting more sick.  So, it's the first day I've worked at this radio station that Earl's not here. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I mean, he would come in because he's got nothing else to do.  This station is his life.  Swear to you.  Where's he going to go?  On a date?  You know?  Right.  Is he going to work around the house?  No.  He comes in here.  He's been coming in here for years.  And his first day that he had to not come in because he's sick and he ends up in the hospital.  I want an update.  But who's going to handle the public file while Earl's in the hospital?  What do you want in this bedpan? 
[00:03:00]  Blood.  The other thing about Earl, I know our mail gets open, but he gets more mail than anyone  because he still gets all Scott Muni's mail.  Yeah.  He gets all that public file crap.  That we don't know what it is.  He has the most mail out of anyone.  Yeah.  He gets like a stack that's like a foot high every day of mail.  So, I don't know.  See that old woman in Connecticut that died?  They figured out that it was cross-contamination.  Some letter that she might have gotten went through the same sorting machine as a contaminated  letter.  Huh.  And that's it.  That's all it takes. 
[00:03:30]  Poor lady survived two world wars, 94 years old, living out the last few days of her life.  What was her name?  And she dies with a thrack.  Oh, Lily.  Oh, Lily.  Some old name that like, you don't look at girls now and go, wow, oh, Lily, you're hot.  Just one of those names they've retired?  Yeah, like Bertha.  We've talked about this before.  How about this one?  Mildred.  We're going to get back to what we started with here.  Yeah.  Know what name has been retired for many years now?  What?  Adolf.  Oh, well, of course. 
[00:04:00]  I think it might still be popular in Germany, though.  I don't know one Adolf.  Have you ever met an Adolf?  Seriously?  No.  No.  He ruined the freaking mustache for everyone.  Ruined the mustache and ruined the name.  And he took one name out of the mix.  I think it was a very popular name.  Remember Adolf's meat tenderizer?  Sure.  Adolf.  That's the only other Adolf right now.  No one is called Adolf, though.  And Mildred, things like that.  Otilli, her name is.  Otilli.  Otilli.  Otilli?  What is that?  And they'd call her Tilly. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, Tilly, 23 Skidoo.  She's a hot one, Rick.  Well, sure, Fred.  Look who's here.  The French chef.  Hey, Frenchie.  Are you cooking today?  Oh, you're broken.  What did you make?  You made a gingerbread house.  He made a gingerbread house.  We say, wow.  Look at that.  It's got our names written on it.  It's got a roof.  It's all gingerbread?  Gingerbread, yeah.  Let's take a picture of it. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  Yeah, we'll take a picture of it before we destroy it.  Yeah, you're going to do that.  Hey, gingerbread's pretty good stuff.  I might have to...  What, you don't like gingerbread, Norton?  No.  No, no?  Gingerbread stinks.  Gingerbread's good.  Gingerbread houses stink.  I'm going to have to rip a wall out of that.  There's only one thing during the holiday season that stinks more than a gingerbread house,  and that would be a fruitcake.  That's the worst.  Fruitcake's a lot.  Fruitcake, number one.  Gingerbread house, number two.  Too bad Earl wasn't here to enjoy that, but he's in the hospital gravely ill. 
[00:05:30]  I could have picked the cotton over here.  All right, listen, so let's get back to your story, Anthony.  So you've got everyone sick around here.  Yeah.  Gravely sick, it seems like, because Earl, yeah, puking and cramping blood in the hospital  as we speak today.  Yeah.  So then we went up to Boston for our little CD signing.  I didn't want to drive because I was sick.  I didn't want to be in a car with my girlfriend driving.  I just didn't want the whole car driving up the Boston experience.  Been doing it a lot lately. 
[00:06:00]  So I decided I'm going to go Amtrak.  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  I'm taking the Amtrak.  Choo-choo-choo-choo.  Did you get business class on the way home like I told you?  No, I don't even know what class.  It didn't matter.  It was late.  Why do I care?  I got in some great handy crap to Ielbo where it was the seats and then a whole bunch  of space in front of me.  Right.  And then we could pull the trays from the back of the seats forward even further, put  the DVD player on there, the portable DVD, and watch some movies. 
[00:06:30]  But it took, put it this way.  I left the hotel in Boston.  I saw when you left.  About noon.  I went shopping for two hours and then finally got in my car and I think I beat you up.  I think you did.  Left at noon.  We had to come here into Manhattan, pick up our cars and drive back to Brooklyn.  Right.  Uh, I left at noon.  I got to my house at 7.30 at night.  So, seven and a half hours.  There is, there are not many places on this planet that take that long to get by air. 
[00:07:00]  Like, you could get, there's a pretty wide spot that you could get to.  You could get all the way to Seattle.  Well, of course.  It's seven and a half hours.  With time to spare.  With time to spare.  Yeah.  You could take the Concorde.  You're over in Europe.  There you go.  So, I took the Amtrak and, uh, you would think more people seem to be taking the railroad  these days because they're afraid to fly.  You would think that we go, okay, guys, this is our shot.  Let's step it up. 
[00:07:30]  We'll really make it good.  Uh, that way, when people aren't afraid to fly anymore, maybe we'll get some of that residual.  People say, well, that was a good experience.  I'll take it anyway.  They were late.  You just see the big delayed thing in front of your train.  It wasn't just our train.  Everyone's train.  Delayed, delayed.  There's no one that gives you an answer as to why they're delayed or how long it's going to be.  I want to know, did a bomb go off on the track?  Or is there a wire that has to be reconnected?  You know, there's no clue if it's going to be a 10-minute delay or three-and-a-half-hour delay. 
[00:08:00]  There's just no answers.  No one cares.  It really sucked.  And that's my personal experience with Amtrak.  Thank you, Amtrak.  I'm flying again.  I'd rather risk maybe flying into a mountain.  Well, no one.  I did Amtrak, New York to Philly, and my train was late an hour and a half, okay?  Check out this one, though.  So the train before me going to the same destination, Philly, which was an hour late, is now arriving in Penn at the time I'm supposed to board my train. 
[00:08:30]  You get it?  Uh-huh.  But I'm not allowed to board that one.  No, because it's the other one.  Oh, no, because it's the other one, and that one's an hour and a half late.  But I'm like, wait, can I get on this one because it's here, and it's going to the same destination?  Not your train.  Oh, they thought I was insane.  Of course.  It's not your train.  And that's the one that was late from before you.  They thought I was insane.  Of course.  But I'm like, technically, my train is on time.  Here it is.  It's just a different name.  No.  It's late.  That was the other late train.  People were losing their minds, like, this doesn't make sense. 
[00:09:00]  So we're not allowed to board this, and it looks like you have room, and we have to wait for our train that's an hour and a half late.  Right.  And they said, yeah, that's how it is, of course.  Yeah.  What are you, stupid?  So I'm not too hip on the whole Amtrak experience.  I didn't bring enough DVDs.  You know, silly me.  I thought, you know, one movie, and then hang out a little bit, maybe sleep.  I don't know.  Two movies tops.  You need at least two movies, and maybe a couple of Twilight Zone episodes to get you through the whole thing.  Just took forever.  It was an awful experience. 
[00:09:30]  I shan't be taking the train again.  All right.  Let's go to Chrissy.  Chrissy, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  What's up?  I just wanted to, if you talk to Black Girl, can you tell him Ice Cream Girl says that she hopes he feels better?  Ice Cream Girl?  Yeah.  We know a lot of Ice Cream Girls.  How do we know you?  Well, I've been in there twice.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I met you in the hallway there.  Yes, you did.  We're going to call Earl in the hospital and see how he's doing.  Yeah, I hope he feels better.  He didn't look too good the other night. 
[00:10:00]  Do you have a little something for Black Girl there, Ice Cream Girl?  I just think he's a really nice guy.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  He's a very sweet guy.  Uh-huh.  All right, we're going to call him soon and then make his life a living hell.  Okay, you guys are great.  Thank you, Chrissy.  Love you.  All right, bye.  There goes Ice Cream Girl from the Ron and Fez show.  Mark, what's going on?  And he has to be how you feel about it.  I just want to let you know that I get on the next plane with European two hours ahead of time,  and I arrive in Ireland in seven and a half hours. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, this guy could get to Ireland before he could get from Boston to New York.  Ireland.  Great.  Thanks.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Are we going to get her all on the phone?  I'm trying out loud.  It is one step above a Greyhound bus.  That's what John is saying, the Amtrak.  It's one step ahead of Greyhound, and I took a Greyhound from Los Angeles to New York.  Me and my brother, when my mom sent out money for airfare for us to get back from California.  Where you were visiting your father.  We were with my dad. 
[00:11:00]  This is a great story.  And my mom sent out money for two tickets on American Airlines from me and my brother,  my father cashed in the tickets and bought us bus tickets and popped us on a Greyhound for a whirlwind, week-long cruise across this great nation of ours.  How long does a bus from L.A. to New York take?  Seriously, a week?  Dude, it took, yeah, a week.  A week on a Greyhound bus.  On a Greyhound bus.  And that's without stopping or anything.  I mean, that's being on the bus the entire time.  Was it at least the bang bus? 
[00:11:30]  No, this bus, it was the dregs of society.  There was a pimp that put his whore on the bus in L.A. and was sending her to a new pimp in Chicago.  So that's the clientele that were taking the bus.  And then she hooked up with a male prostitute who was on his way somewhere, and then they decided they were going to team up.  And also there was an Uzo bum, some Greek guy that was just snotted on Uzo the whole time. 
[00:12:00]  And when he passed out, me and Joe and the hookers stole his Uzo and got hammered.  It's really a week, and you have to sleep in your seat for a week.  A week.  And my father's great.  He gave us like 20 bucks each to get us across country in a week, which we promptly lost in the slot machines in Vegas trying to parlay it.  And how old were you?  I think I was about 14.  My brother was 15, 16.  Yeah.  Brother Joe.  No. 
[00:12:30]  What's up?  Hey, remember that, Joe?  Maybe I was 16.  Yeah, you had to be about 14 years old.  Isn't that fun?  We, um, yeah.  Did you, uh, talk about Antoine and what was her name?  BJ, the hooker?  Yeah, the hooker.  Antoine was, it was, it was in the, like, uh, uh, 70s.  So what it was, was, uh, this guy, and he was just like Huggy Bear or something.  He had like the hat and the feather and he was, uh, he was putting his girl on the bus like he traded her for another bitch or something in Chicago. 
[00:13:00]  He's like, you do me proud, baby.  You do me proud.  And, uh, he kisses her and he's making faces at her through the window.  And the hooker's sitting there.  She's going, bye, I love you, Antoine.  She was white, but she talked black.  And she's going, oh, Antoine, you fool.  Dude, and it was Peppa Mae Bradley.  Peppa Mae Bradley.  That was her name.  Peppa Mae Bradley.  Peppa Mae Bradley.  Yeah.  The hookers, the Uzo bums, it was fabulous.  And then I fell asleep, uh, one day, and I woke up and half my head was asleep.  Like, I pinched a nerve, because you can't sleep in those seats. 
[00:13:30]  So I pinched a nerve or a blood vessel in my neck, and half of my skull fell asleep for the entire ride.  I'd be like, dude, my head is numb.  Did it feel like you had a stroke or something?  Yeah, I was like, uh-oh, oh, great.  I'm 13, I had a stroke.  This is wonderful.  And what about the nice-looking chick that we were competing for?  Yeah, that was a girl.  She was going to Cheyenne, and she decided to stay on the bus and hang out with us into New York.  Thank God she did, because we got arrested when we pulled into the bus terminal in New York. 
[00:14:00]  And this cop comes up and goes, come here, because we're looking for runaways.  So he goes, get your bags and meet me back here.  I don't understand why he left us alone for a minute.  But I don't either, especially I had that big open-blade knife strapped to my hip.  Yeah, well, it turns out my brother Joe thought it was a fantastic time to bring back tie stick and drag it from California.  So we had a suitcase full of pot, and we left it with this girl from Cheyenne while we had to go get debriefed by the police. 
[00:14:30]  And she was cool.  She hung on to it until we got done, and we got out and grabbed it from her.  I was scared assless, though, man.  Who was it?  And I'm like, look, he goes, oh, I've got to call your mother if she's going to come pick you up.  I was like, yeah, she's coming to pick us up.  She knows we're coming in.  I was like, oh, I've got to call her.  Like, oh, all right, look, when you call her, say, I'm with your two sons here who are fine.  I just want to know if, and then your questions. 
[00:15:00]  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He gets her on the phone.  Hello.  Pretty much saying, did you have two children that were, oh, it scares the bejesus out of her.  I'm in the background like, well, we're okay.  Don't worry, man.  She never came to pick us up.  Well, we had to get on the Long Island Railroad.  Yeah.  And go out to Huntington.  Yeah.  What a great time that was, but that was great.  That was, I tell you, the Amtrak trip, if it was longer, it would be just as miserable.  Amtrak. 
[00:15:30]  I'm sticking to the air.  All right, brother Joe.  I never stunk so much in my entire life.  Oh, yeah.  I was just going to get back to New York and just give me a shower.  Do you guys get to get off the bus for a little while to stretch your legs?  When they stop to pick up more dregs and let off dregs and whatever, you get to get off, stretch your legs,  but you spend a week in your seat or in the bathroom in the back of the bus.  What a nice pop.  That's it, man.  It was foul.  Instead of, what, a six-hour flight?  Hey, you needed some cash.  The Uzo bums. 
[00:16:00]  That Uzo bum that just stunk like the whole way.  And there's no...  Some of these puking, burping, farting.  The guy was just disgusting.  And there's no, like, shower in the back?  I don't know.  It was a week straight of just stinking and...  Oh, my God.  I would go absolutely insane.  Yeah.  There was an onboard bathroom, though, because it stunk to high health.  Yeah.  Yeah, the bathroom was just anus.  Really bad.  Two days.  Two days of Uzo bum dumping in the rear of the bus. 
[00:16:30]  It was effing nasty.  All right, brother Joe.  All right, fellas.  See you later.  Thank you.  There he goes, Joe.  TJ, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You're bringing back some terrible memories from this summer.  I took a greyhound across from San Francisco to New York, man.  Yeah.  Dude, I was stuck next to this punk girl, like, who just kept on talking about how she would  eff her boyfriend with a spiked dildo.  Dude, it was like a nightmare, bro.  Yeah, people that just won't shut up.  And it's no way to travel. 
[00:17:00]  Well, maybe if you're going from one city to the nearest city, you know, it's not going  to be more than two hours.  Like, I know a lot of people take that Peter Pan bus from New York to Boston.  If you can't, you know, hey, if you can't afford it, what the hell?  It's not going to kill you.  Yeah, but when you're going 3,000 miles, man, a bus is no way to do it.  It was terrible.  We got stopped in Nebraska and got stormed by state troopers.  It was a nightmare.  Yeah, I'd assume it's a good place to find, like, criminals trying to flee. 
[00:17:30]  It pretty much is.  That's all that's on there are fleeing criminals.  And quickly, Tim on line two has got something else.  Thank you, TJ.  Tim.  Hey, Tim, what's up, man?  Anthony, man, what are you talking about?  I went from New York to Seattle, bro.  They stop at Chicago, different cities.  Man, sometimes you have to wait, like, seven hours for the next bus to pull up.  You get out.  Yeah, you know what?  We never got off the bus.  You can get off, and with your ticket, you could hop back on any other bus at any other 
[00:18:00]  time.  You could stay there a month and then hop back on a bus and continue your run.  But I had no money.  But, see, I'm assuming that L.A. to New York, that's, you know, that's, boom, that bus  is going L.A. to New York.  If you're going to a place like Seattle or something, you've got to transfer here and  there.  Yeah, you did have to transfer if you were going elsewhere.  You get off in one city and you wait for the next bus a few hours?  Yeah.  Sure.  No, this one, and it stopped at so many places in between L.A. and New York.  Well, that's got to drive you crazy because you're on a highway and then you're taking that  exit ramp. 
[00:18:30]  The whole way.  You stop.  All right.  It's all you're hearing is smelling bathroom.  You take the exit ramp and you know it's like a 15, 20 minute ride.  Yeah.  Bus depot.  Oh, yeah.  Just having all this time on your week long journey.  Oh, my God.  It's like a wagon.  Like the wagon trains they used to take out west.  Someone wants to know how they switch drivers.  They pull into the bus depot. 
[00:19:00]  And a guy will hop on and we won't get off.  And they change the dregs of society.  And then, you know, you get a new driver.  They refuel whatever it takes.  Yeah.  Man, that's crazy.  It was something.  All right.  We should take a break, Anthony.  We're just getting started.  Jim Norton in the studio.  The Frenchie's here with the gingerbread house.  We have Richard Cheese in the lounge against the machine guys.  Isn't that what they offered the Nazis to not take over France?  Exactly.  Please do not take us.  I have a gingerbread house. 
[00:19:30]  Look at the butt of the rifle in your face.  You French.  I love it.  And we got a band today.  Yes, we do.  We'll be playing in and out of breaks with Richard Cheese in lounge against the machine.  They're setting up the guys.  And they'll be on the radio next with us.  So stay there.  He's a son of a bitch.  Anthony.  That guy's a rapist.  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:00]  Yo.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Looking very pissed off, Anthony.  Hey.  What's your problem, bro?  The technology's got him down.  I have a Palm Pilot.  And I'm running to the toilet.  And I drop my Palm Pilot.  And the batteries.  I have the type that takes batteries.  Yeah.  Both tumble out.  They're back in place in 30 seconds.  Every effing number I have is gone.  My chess game is gone.  Everything is gone.  What happens when your batteries just run out? 
[00:20:30]  I don't know.  It's never happened.  But apparently you lose everything.  Scumbags at Palm.  I hope you're listening.  You're scumbags.  There's not even a place in there to keep your numbers for 30 seconds.  I don't have a chip.  I would think there'd be something in there.  Yeah.  A little capacitor.  Yeah, because the batteries are going to go out eventually.  You were assuming too much, my friend.  Yeah, absolutely no leeway whatsoever.  None.  Not a 10-second leeway.  Three seconds later, the batteries win.  So you drop the Palm Pilot.  Batteries fall out.  You lose everything.  I quickly put them back in.  How many numbers? 
[00:21:00]  387, actually.  387 numbers.  Gone.  Now, have you hot-synced?  Yes.  And I can get them back.  Yes.  On the principle, I am furious.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hello?  Mike, go.  Took a bus one time from upstate New York.  Yeah.  I was with my wife.  And for some reason, we pulled off in a place where I had no idea where I was.  And we picked up a busload of Attica prisoners who just got out.  Prisoners were getting on the bus. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, that's great.  Hacked with them.  Well, they did their time, and now they're going back into society.  Yeah.  Except my wife was the only female on the bus.  Oh, really?  Yeah, one of the few.  They haven't seen females.  You got it.  And now I was stuck with them for a three-and-a-half-hour ride into the city.  That's classic.  With their plastic bags, their luggage.  Right.  Shaking.  Did it work out for you, though?  Yeah, it worked out.  It's something I never got over, though.  Yeah.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  I got to go to Roast Beef, because he says he can help Norton out. 
[00:22:00]  Roast Beef.  Roast?  It's Roast Beef, man.  Whatever.  What's up?  Roast Beef.  Yo, man, you got to connect it to your computer, and you save everything.  Oh, he...  Of course the batteries are going to...  No, dude, I did that.  That's what he said.  But just the idea that the information just goes away so quickly, and all that work is  spoiling.  Right.  It's just aggravated.  Because I need numbers today.  I'm going to make a couple calls, and I can't...  Right on, right on.  But there's an indicator that tells you when the battery's going to run out.  No, no, but I know, but his batteries fell out.  There's no indicator.  He dropped the whole unit, man.  It should be able to stay there until you pop the batteries back in. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  That's what he's saying.  I'm sorry.  He's saying there should be some type of leeway.  Batteries fall out.  You got 30 seconds to get your damn things back in there.  Although, I got to say, that did look like one of the first POMs they've put out.  It's the POM 3XE.  All right.  Yeah, it's kind of an older POM.  You got that a few years ago.  No, I just got it because my other one was stolen.  Let me see.  Let me see your POM.  Out of my car, so I got a new one, and I bought a POM.  Stolen.  Jeez, what kind of friggin' crime evidence was on that thing that someone stole? 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Nice little chess game.  Spoiled.  Batteries.  Takes regular double A's, does it?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  How you doing, ONA?  Pretty good, man.  Norton, hello.  Hello, sir.  Anyway, Anthony, I'm calling because you're so upset about your ride from coast to coast.  Took you about a week.  Yeah.  I was on the Greyhound.  I took the Greyhound from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Kansas City, Kansas. 
[00:23:30]  Not too far if you made a straight line.  Yeah.  But 27 and a half hours.  All right.  Okay?  27 and a half hours.  From Santa Fe, we went straight up to Denver, Colorado, and then down to Kansas City.  But the story gets much better.  Anthony, did you ever...  Does it get longer, too?  Dude, I'll be a minute.  Maybe that.  Anthony, on your ride... 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my God.  Joe, Joe, Joe, it says on the screen, I had a pissed-off husband follow my bus from Mexico  to Colorado.  How long does it take to say that?  Okay.  Well, whatever.  We picked...  Hey, all right.  We picked up this girl in Taos, New Mexico.  Okay?  Hey, the husband followed us up to the second stop in Colorado.  All right?  Back in.  State police.  State police.  Hold the bus over.  Torture!  That's torture!  Asshole. 
[00:24:30]  Let's flip.  Portable!  Shut up.  What a dick.  I said, I had a pissed-off husband follow the bus for...  Yeah, tell that story.  ...to Mexico to Colorado.  Let's tell that one.  Oh, yeah.  And let me tell you, the story really...  If you've got to say, and the story really gets great from here.  Are you ready?  Oof.  I took a bite of a bus ride this weekend.  It was aggravating me.  I was going from Jerusalem to Haifa.  Oh, my God, Joe. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  They tried to take Arafat out today.  Oh, they certainly did.  Look at that.  Those Israelis are insane, I've got to tell you.  They know how to respond to something.  It happens that night.  The next morning, there are copters and rockets right there at your door.  And, you know, they had a lot of people die and injured in suicide bombings over the weekend.  They respond immediately with a helicopter rocket attack on Arafat's house. 
[00:25:30]  Some other Palestinian leaders, his helicopter.  He blew up...  I don't understand.  They blew up Arafat's helicopter.  All of Israel may be defending himself.  Hello.  I was the Osborne, but I don't condone the killing of innocent helicopters.  He pulled a helicopter on a pad, and it's just sitting there, and they blew it up, and the helicopter didn't do a thing. 
[00:26:00]  The thing is, we have to institute a mission of helicopter rights, so we don't injure helicopters.  Thank you, Ozzy.  Yes.  Helicopter rights.  Blew up his helicopter.  Blew up like a...  They went for his house and everything. 
[00:26:30]  They are trying to kill Yasser Arafat.  This world's getting interesting.  When I saw the suicide bombings in Israel on the news, I'm like, all right, you watch this.  Because these Israelis, they don't take time.  They don't sit and have the president make some speeches and go, we're going to do this, and we're going to do...  The president only comes on to say, we did this.  They don't take their time because they know exactly who did it.  Right.  We weren't really sure at first.  Yeah.  We had some ideas, but we had to make sure.  When something happens over there, they know who did it. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, it's going to get really interesting over there.  Like it has in the past, anyway.  I like our own situation, though, over there in Afghanistan right now.  You hear about the American kid?  Little American kid from California?  Yo, dude, I'm going to go fight for the Taliban.  This kid was from California.  He converted to Muslim religion when he was in his teens.  Then he told his parents he was going to Pakistan to help out some Muslim humanitarian thing. 
[00:27:30]  Turns out he somehow went from that to fighting for the Taliban.  And he was in that prison uprising.  He survived it with a small group that decided to go down into the basement to hide out and fight from there and not give up kind of a thing.  Well, the Northern Alliance has a way of getting people out of the basement.  First, they dropped diesel fuel down there and lit it.  This is... 
[00:28:00]  Bravo!  Bravo!  To smoke them out.  To smoke them out.  Not all of them came out.  Not all of them came out.  Tough little boogers.  They're like roaches, those people.  And the American kid, it was one of them.  He had a bullet hole in his leg, some other wounds from shrapnel.  And now he's in this basement that they poured diesel fuel in and lit.  Well, diesel fuel, I guess, was hard to come by.  They couldn't pour a lot of it down.  One thing they did have a supply of was water.  Cold water.  They ran through some chillers or something.  And they pumped icy water down into the basement until they all came running up like rats. 
[00:28:30]  Is that brilliant?  I love it.  I love the fact that they got these damp animals to come out of this basement.  The only thing bad is they should have shot them as they came up one at a time.  And this American was one of them.  He was interviewed on CNN talking about how he was fighting for the Taliban.  He's a convert.  And his parents, his mother goes, oh, he's a quiet kid.  Quiet, shy, nice kid. 
[00:29:00]  Isn't that treason at that point?  Absolutely.  Can we just shoot them dead?  This guy, an American citizen, picked up arms against the United States government.  Treason, shot, that's the only way to deal with it.  You try him here, a military trial, and you shoot him.  It's a little example.  Sweet American kid.  Yeah, that's how they're, uh...  That's what the parents are calling him.  He's a sweet kid. 
[00:29:30]  Kind of shy.  Tony, what's going on?  Yeah, one of you dicks just made fun of the bus bombing in Israel the other day.  Who was that?  Me.  Oh, no one's making fun of anything, sir.  Yeah, they did.  I was...  You know, I don't listen to this show.  Oh, it always starts with that.  I don't listen to the show, but...  I don't listen to the show.  My elbow just happened to hit the scanner, and I bounced onto you guys.  You weren't listening to us.  At least admit that.  I was not listening.  I was flipping around.  So how did you get to our show if you weren't listening? 
[00:30:00]  I love this crap.  You were listening, and then you heard something you didn't like, and then also, hey, man,  I don't listen to you guys, but...  You were listening.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  See?  Oh, see, even though the terminology...  You tool...  You dick.  I hate people that say that.  You know, I don't listen to your station, but I was reaching for coffee, and my arm hit  the scanner, and I came across you pigs.  Did you hear him?  You guys shouldn't be making fun of him anymore.  He turned up his radio so he could hear himself, too. 
[00:30:30]  Bye, Tony.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, you shouldn't be making fun of this.  Ah, Johnny, what's going on?  How's it going, ONA?  And Morton, you are amazing.  Thank you, buddy.  I just want to know if you guys saw Vladi Divac in Palestine the other day.  If you go to page six in the airport, it is Vladi Divac.  Opie and...  I said that today in the back office.  I'm like, no one's going to get this.  He looks just like Vladi Divac in the paper, doesn't he?  Yeah, Rick Fox was there a couple weeks ago, I swear to God. 
[00:31:00]  What page in the New York paper?  The real page six, not the fake page six.  Yeah, page six, the real page six in the post.  The guy they arrested looks just like Vladi Divac.  And I said that to Stinky.  I'm like, how many people are going to get this one, Stink?  All right, Johnny.  All right, thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Let's go to Baxter.  Baxter, what's up?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yo, you guys see Rumsfeld this week on Meet the Press?  Baxter.  Yeah, Rumsfeld rocks every time he's on TV.  Yeah, that guy knows how to talk.  Rumsfeld got all squirmy on him and said, you know, well, you might have to gas him out. 
[00:31:30]  He did one of those cute little smiles when he adjusted glasses.  Yeah, right.  And said, well, we're going to flood them out, actually.  Right.  And he just looks so happy about it.  Yeah, this guy...  Rumsfeld rocks.  There's no BS with this guy, Rumsfeld, man.  You know what's great, and this is an example that other politicians should pick up on, is what Rumsfeld's doing right now.  Right from the beginning, this guy didn't back down.  He didn't try to sound politically correct when he's talking about the job of killing people. 
[00:32:00]  He got on and spoke plain and clearly about what was going on.  And some of the press would be, like, asking him these questions that are supposed to make him sit and go, oh, I better answer this right.  Oh, boy, I don't want to make it sound like we're killing people.  It's a war, first of all.  And he never bowed down to that.  And people were looking at him with respect and listening to what he says and feeling like they're getting an honest appraisal of what's going on.  Yeah, he didn't sugarcoat anything.  And that's how it should be.  I hope more people pick up on this. 
[00:32:30]  Because, you see, it's not killing this guy.  People are digging the way he's handling the press.  And if more people had balls like this and not try to sugarcoat it and not try to look at the polls and let that dictate what you're going to say, just speak plain and clear like this guy does, you probably do well for yourself.  Unlike that tool Bill Clinton that was in there.  I read a whole thing on him that just made me puke how after every terrorist event we had, the embassies being bombed in Africa, the coal being bombed in Yemen, he looked at the polls. 
[00:33:00]  And since he was still getting a high approval rating, his people told him, don't respond to this with anything more than words, than strong words on how you're going to find these people.  Because that might bring your rating down.  You're doing fine.  You don't have to do anything.  And he listened to them and did nothing.  He spoke like, we're going to hunt these people down.  It's going to be great.  We're going to kick ass.  And did nothing.  And that's why we're where we are now, by the way.  And don't let anyone tell you different. 
[00:33:30]  But this Rumsfeld man is right in there and he will just tell you what's going on.  How do you intend on getting these people out of this basement?  Well, we're going to gas them, burn them and flood them out.  Okay.  Oh, well, doesn't that mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, it does mean we're killing them.  Yes.  Next.  He is John Wayne.  It shuts them right up because they can't find the question that they're looking for that's going to make them go, oh, boy, I can't say this.  He is John Wayne, man.  We're going to pump razor blades and AIDS down into the basement.  We got some clips, actually. 
[00:34:00]  We got some Rumsfeld?  Yeah, well, this one's about the ground war.  Check it out.  Rumsfeld.  We are entering a very dangerous aspect of this conflict.  There is no question about it.  It is a confused situation in the country.  The amount of real estate they have to operate on has continually been reduced.  The noose is tightening, but the remaining task is a particularly dirty and unpleasant.  Yeah, they're telling you like it is, man.  It's a dangerous part of the war. 
[00:34:30]  Here's Rumsfeld.  The whole part dangerous?  Yeah.  Here's about using gas to get them out of the tunnels.  Ah.  Rumsfeld.  If need be, would we put gas into those caves to flush them out?  Well, I noticed that in Mazar, the way they finally got the dead-enders to come out was by flooding the tunnel.  And finally, they came up and surrendered.  The last hardcore Al-Qaeda elements.  And I guess one will do whatever it is necessary to do.  If people will not surrender, then they've made their choice. 
[00:35:00]  Nice.  See, that's what they've got to understand.  Again, we aren't going into people's houses, the United States government, while they're sleeping somewhere and pumping gas and water into their basement to get them out.  These people have chosen their own destiny.  They have chosen, if you don't come out, are we going to walk away and let them regroup somewhere?  No.  You stay there until they come out or they die.  And that's the way he puts it.  And I love it.  I would be honored to stand in a shopping bag and drain Mr. Rumsfeld's mule. 
[00:35:30]  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.  A lot of crinkle, crinkle jokes in Boston this week is in the shopping bag.  When we were hanging with everybody at Newbury Comics.  Someone actually goes, look what I brought.  He brought a big shopping bag.  You got crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.  Those confused little feet moving around inside the bag.  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.  And finally, Rumsfeld, what if they don't surrender?  Uh-huh.  The hope is that they'll surrender and save the city and save some of their lives and that they will do that. 
[00:36:00]  The problem is that in most of these situations, there have been not just Afghans, but also outsiders, mostly Arab.  But in some cases, Pakistanis and other countries, some Chinese, some Chechians.  And they tended to be the most determined and the toughest fighters.  And in some cases, they have actually killed Afghan Taliban if they threatened to surrender or to defect. 
[00:36:30]  So it is a complicated situation.  If they don't surrender, they're going to be killed.  That's plain English, man.  Boy, you don't need somebody to interpret that line for you, do you?  You were starting to sound like some of our callers, though.  I'm like, get to the point.  Like the point?  All right.  They don't surrender, they're going to be killed.  There you go.  You heard it.  That's it.  That's it.  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  Wouldn't you hate to live next door to Rumsfeld and piss him off? 
[00:37:00]  If you don't turn down that freaking music, I'm calling in an airstrike.  He would be the worst neighbor.  Norton, you suck, man, from the bottom of my heart.  Thank you, buddy.  See you.  The children of the neighboring yard will be moved out of my flower bed.  Right.  We will make an attempt to move them out peaceably.  If this is not, if we cannot do this, we will use explosives, napalm.  And I'm sending my dogs in. 
[00:37:30]  Send my German shepherds in.  He's got some people to throw him and eat his at their house.  So, Anthony, what's going on?  O.P., Norton, Anthony, Brooklyn.  In the house.  In the house, brother.  Listen, this is why you guys rock.  Because you're not some self-serving show that has a bunch of misfits around them telling  them how great he is.  Well, you're not two over-the-hill douchebags in D.C. that talk about their wife and their  kid and driving them to parties and their school friends and their English people on 
[00:38:00]  the block.  Nobody cares.  18 months can't come fast enough, all right?  You guys rule.  Martin, you rule.  You guys are like the Rumsfeld or the radio.  Well, thank you.  The Rumsfeld or the radio.  You're welcome.  And O.P., who do you like against Miami and the Rose Bowl?  You know what?  I don't even want to talk football.  Oh, my Jets blew it last night.  O.P., listen, I'm the guy.  I almost drove off the Mass Pike on the way home.  Oh, there's a local reverend.  Well, that's where I was when the freaking Jets were losing to the Pats. 
[00:38:30]  I was losing to the game on WBCN, of course, and I couldn't believe they couldn't get a  drive together at the end.  The only thing is you guys got to stop talking all this Boston crap.  Don't forget where your bread is, buddy.  Oh, we know.  Everything is fine.  We went up to Boston.  We got laid.  Everything's fine.  We're back.  Let's relax, okay?  All right.  But listen.  Listen, Anthony.  You live in Brooklyn.  You know.  This is the kind of guy that doesn't stop.  You go, okay.  And he goes, all right, all right. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I know.  Your mom's box.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  There you go.  That's a great way to punch out.  Who knows what made the radio from that little phone call.  Okay.  That's insane.  Let's get Richard Cheese in here.  Incidentally, can I just mention that in the last eight years, in December, the Jets are  seven and 20.  Shut up.  Wow.  It's even worse than that, actually.  It goes back even further.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they always suck in December.  December, not kind to the Jets.  How about that Brady, though, man? 
[00:39:30]  I give him props again.  Bledsoe's got to be losing his mind at this point.  Brady takes his job and then just continues to perform.  Richard Cheese, what's up, bro?  Hey, nice gingerbread cake.  How does Boston and Massachusetts feel about Bledsoe these days, Ben?  You got a line on that?  Yeah, kind of iffy?  Nah.  They like him still?  Huh?  They love their losers up there.  They don't have a losing team.  The pats are right in it now. 
[00:40:00]  I'm talking about Drew.  Pats are, we're going nowhere fast, and now they're right in it.  Yeah.  They're right in the hunt.  Richard Cheese.  Oh, hunt.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  All right, sorry.  That mic's not working, my brother.  How about this one?  Is this one working?  Yeah.  How are you, baby?  How have you been?  Good, good.  I love you, guys.  Thanks for having us back.  Nah, no problem.  Can I get my piano player to play while I'm talking?  Sure.  That's the only time.  I only have a piano player to talk.  You need musical accompaniment.  Always.  Can you hear me now on this mic?  Yeah.  Oh, can they hear you?  Well, testing one, two, three. 
[00:40:30]  Or as they say, we're going to do a two-hour.  If you have a player to play, it's usually good if he starts playing.  Play me a little music, my friend.  He's probably in the bathroom.  Maybe he's puking and crapping blood.  I think he's on a bus to high five.  Is he?  He's playing.  We can't hear him.  That's all right.  But, you know, thank you.  Is he really playing out there?  Awful.  All right.  Well, you got a gig, Richard Cheese?  Yeah, baby.  We're going to be at the Mercury Lounge tomorrow night.  And speaking of local references, we're going to be in Philadelphia on Friday at the Trocadero. 
[00:41:00]  There you go.  And we're very excited to be back in New York.  And we got some numbers for you today.  We're going to do some new tunes and some old tunes and some Christmas tunes.  Old Christmas tunes.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Would you like to hear one now?  It's in the Christmas spirit.  I don't know if we could get your piano player to play.  They're freaking out right here.  Unfortunately, there's no music today.  That's all right.  All right.  They're running around.  Hold on.  Yes, Norton.  Peter Boyle is working on the problem.  Yes, he is.  Everybody loves raining.  There you go. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  How's that?  Is that working any better?  You made the yummy noise.  Loved it in hardcore.  All right.  In hardcore.  I have that on video on beta.  It's one of our favorite movies.  Peter Boyle was in hardcore.  That's right.  I have it on beta.  Who was it?  Oh, he was the cop.  He was the cop.  He was the guy that found the film.  That's right.  Of the daughter.  That's right.  Having sex in the hardcore theater.  God, that's great.  I love this place.  How are we doing? 
[00:42:00]  Do we have any music back there?  Oh, here comes Pete.  Oh, no.  Pete, oh, no.  They had to bring in the big guns.  The big guns.  Pete Johnson.  Peter?  I know which buttons to push.  Look, he pushed one button.  What button?  Pete, look at the board.  For two seconds, he is the Rumsfeld of engineering.  He pushed one button.  No holds barred.  I will push the button.  No holds barred with Pete.  I love that.  Oh, that's so much better.  Oh, look, now you sound great.  Yeah, and I brought my reverb with me from the east, and I'm very happy. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, boys.  All right.  So, you're going to give us a little tune, a little quickie here?  No, I'm sorry.  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  Of course.  This is a little tune by the kids in the Dead Kennedys.  I think you'll like this one.  Oh, okay.  Because it's the holiday season, and we're overseas right now.  What do you say we do a little holiday in Cambodia?  You got a lot of reverb there, my friend.  Yeah, turn down the reverb there, Peter.  Sounds like you're in a gym.  Oh, that's much better.  Is that a little better or a little less?  Oh, that's very sweet.  Hit it, boys.  This is a song from our Lounge Against the Machines CD. 
[00:43:00]  So, you've been to school for a year or two, and you know you've seen it all.  In daddy's car, thinking you'll go far.  Back east, you're tight, don't crawl.  Play at Nicky Jazz to parade your snaz on your five grand stereo.  Bragging that you know how the brothers feel cold and the slums got so much soul.  It's time to face what you most fear. 
[00:43:30]  Right guard will not help you here.  Grace, you're self, my dear.  It's a holiday in Cambodia.  It's tough there, but it's life.  A holiday in Cambodia.  Don't forget to pack your wife.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Isn't that a fabulous number?  That's nice.  I feel in the holiday spirit. 
[00:44:00]  It's hot.  Pole pot.  Pole pot.  Oh.  Oh.  Holiday in Cambodia.  It's tough there, but it's life.  A holiday in Cambodia.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Richard Cheese.  You know, I love you against the machine, yeah.  I got the sore throat like that guy in the hospital.  Earl.  Yeah, give me a Vermont teddy bear, would you? 
[00:44:30]  And we'll have it embroidered with your name on it.  Thank you.  You know, there's not enough Christmas songs with pole pot in it.  I know.  You know?  It's a great lyric.  It's a Camerouge and everything that goes along with it.  It's such a Christmassy kind of thing.  It is.  It's a killing field.  It's wonderful.  Santa Claus.  When Santa Claus goes down to Afghanistan.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  He's going to pour some diesel down the chimney.  Ah.  Isn't that sweet?  Burn up the kids.  Burn up the kids.  Because normally we get coal.  That's right.  Instead of coal, it's going to be hot burning Rumsfeld oil. 
[00:45:00]  Flaming diesel fuel.  I love how they're using tactics that were used back in the medieval times.  The burning liquid on you thing.  Are they throwing any bloated animal carcasses to give them diseases?  Isn't that a good one?  They used to catapult like dead cows over the wall and give them all kinds of diseases.  Yeah, we're catapulting dead livestock over the wall.  You wanted to hear it and I said it.  Thank you, Mr. Rumsfeld.  I love how the piano guy is just kind of giving you a little music. 
[00:45:30]  It's almost like...  As you rant.  Today, kids, we're going to go to the hat factory and we're going to see how hats are made.  So if you want to come with me, look who just joined us.  It's Mr. McFeely.  Crinkle, crinkle.  He's coming in.  We'll get a kid in a bathroom stall to stand in front of me with a little bag.  In a little shopping bag so when the police look underneath, they can't see him. 
[00:46:00]  And his confused little feet, they go crinkle, crinkle.  Here comes the trolley.  Here comes the trolley.  He's got the trolley, man.  Bobby, my piano player, Bobby Ricardo, was the actual accompaniment for Mr. Rogers for many years.  Oh, how about that?  Until he was forced to testify and then he wouldn't do it anymore.  It's over.  That's right.  Nice work, Bobby.  Richard Cheese, why don't you play us the commercials with something here?  Sure, boys.  What do you say we do that Linkin Park number that we love so much?  That One Step Closer.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Everything you say to me.  I need a little room to breathe.  Everything you say to me.  I love this wireless microphone.  I can walk around the studio.  Yeah.  Take me home, boys.  Shut up when I'm talking to you.  Shut up.  Shut up when I'm talking to you. 
[00:47:00]  Shut up.  Okay, guys, shut up.  Seriously, they're going to commercials.  Shut up.  Everybody shut up out there.  All right, I've got to go out there.  Thanks, guys.  I'll be back.  I'm Richard Cheese in Lounge Against the Machine.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A visit from Tom Brokaw?  Possibly.  Right around the corner.  Welcome to the bottomless kick of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard. 
[00:47:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That thing's hilarious.  Let's do a little smack my bitch up, Bobby.  Yeah.  Change my picture.  Smack my picture.  Thank you.  Change my picture.  Smack my picture.  Yeah.  Whoa. 
[00:48:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Change.  Change my picture.  Smack my picture.  Ouch.  Smack my picture, everybody.  Yeah.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got a house band today, Anthony.  Yes.  This is Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine helping us out with the tunes as we  go in and out of break today. 
[00:48:30]  So I think I've got to keep your mic up so we can hear you.  Can you hear me now?  There we go.  Thank you.  All right.  It's the O&A Show in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow.  A couple things real fast, Anthony.  Yeah.  This Friday on the show, what the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  I love the idea of what the hell is that.  We're doing a service.  We've seen a lot of crazy things growing on people that have come into this radio show. 
[00:49:00]  Sandy Kane has inspired us.  Yeah.  First and foremost, Sandy Kane.  There was also the plague.  Remember the plague?  We're going to have to bring the plague back for this.  But Sandy Kane had that thing we like to call twatto.  It looks like quatto from Total Recall.  It's a little growing conjoined herpes sore.  I don't know what it is on her area.  And we don't know what it is.  We keep telling her it's genital warts. 
[00:49:30]  And she gets mad.  She gets really mad because now no one will touch her because of us.  Yeah.  So now we finally decided we're going to get a doctor in and have him decide what the  hell is that.  On Sandy Kane.  And then we're inviting other people down with their afflictions and groats and things.  Abnormalities.  Do they have to be on the genital area?  No.  They could be anywhere.  We have a guy that has a yam bag under his armpit.  Great.  Great.  We're trying to figure out that one.  I might send some people down here.  Good.  We'll have a doctor and he'll straighten the whole thing out. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, Richard.  Richard, are you more important than us that you have to have reverb and no reverb?  No.  You want me to turn off?  I'll switch to the no reverb mic.  How's that?  I kind of like you on this.  No, I like you on the reverb.  You like me on the reverb?  Okay, good.  I'll be here.  I'm the voice of God today.  It makes you sound pompous.  Yeah.  Yes, I am.  Thank you.  Someone wants to know if you can do DMX.  Sure.  Give us a few minutes to work it up between the break.  Oh, really?  Absolutely.  We'll play anything, baby.  We'll take requests.  All right.  Because Brother Joe does DMX in a James Taylor style.  James Taylor DMX.  We might have to play that a little later. 
[00:50:30]  I'd love to.  It's pretty funny.  All right.  Yeah, I met this girl at a bar at a club we played the other night in Baltimore.  And she had this thing.  I don't know what it was.  It could have been a burn.  It could have been a mole.  It could have been another hand grown out of her butt.  I don't know what it was.  Oh, boy.  But I didn't look at it.  I just looked away from it.  You still...  I could cover it up with my hand, so it was okay.  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't deter you from your mission.  No, it did not.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  All right, so if you want to be part of What the Hell is That?  It goes down Friday.  Give us a call.  Tell us what you got. 
[00:51:00]  We're going to get a few doctors down here, and they're going to pretty much tell you what  you got.  Right.  All right?  Yeah.  Sandy Cain is booked for Friday.  Rick?  Um, sure.  Show doesn't work without Sandy Cain.  No.  And then, Anthony, a week from tomorrow.  Yeah.  What you have been waiting two years for.  Two years in the making?  The return of...  Yeah.  The homeless shopping spree.  Oh, thank God.  We're helping again.  One week from tomorrow, the return of the homeless shopping spree.  Look how we help on this program. 
[00:51:30]  You know, we are helping people with medical conditions, with what the hell is that?  And now, we get to help the homeless yet again.  Remember when we helped them a couple of years back on Christmas?  We gathered up some of New York's most disgusting, smelly homeless.  The real homeless, Richard.  Real homeless.  Not the fake homeless.  The ones that live, you know, right on the street.  Smell.  No shoes.  Urine soaked.  Just disgusting homeless.  Those are the best kind of homeless people.  The only kind of homeless.  Well, there's a few fake homeless people out there.  Yeah, I don't like that. 
[00:52:00]  But they live in a shelter or something.  We're talking about people that live in dorms.  The hardcore homeless.  The hardcore homeless, yes.  And if you remember, we gathered them up, we threw them on a bus, gave them $102 each, and  took them to one of the most exclusive malls in this area.  Short Hills Mall.  The Short Hills Mall.  Where they went on a shopping spree and were met by cheering crowds that were fans of our show.  A couple thousand people followed them around the mall. 
[00:52:30]  And met by pull-down grates in front of a lot of the stores that normally don't come down until closing time.  But for some reason...  And then there's a chant.  God, we should just replay the show from two years ago.  Then there's a chant.  Let the homeless shop.  Nothing better than...  What is the suit place that's in there?  Is Versace in there?  Versace's in there.  Nothing more fun than watching the look on a Versace employee's face when he sees the 
[00:53:00]  likes of little short, smelly Ziggy coming in.  He's going to foul one of their suits.  Well, he tried on a suit.  He tried on a suit.  His urine-smelling, disgusting body in one of those Versace suits was priceless.  Just for that reason, don't let him shower before the shopping spree.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no.  We pick him fresh off the street.  There's no showering, no nothing.  Richard, we have people on the street right now looking for the best homeless people.  Great.  Some of them get turned down. 
[00:53:30]  They don't look homeless enough.  They don't look disheveled or stinky.  Come to our show tomorrow night at the Mercury Lounge.  We get a huge homeless contagion.  Of your whole audience, right?  Absolutely.  It's great.  Look at you sneaking the plug in.  You're doing how I do it?  You're good.  Wait, let me mention Commonwealth Avenue in Boston.  Give me a bell for a local Boston reference.  Thank you.  Yeah, I love Commonwealth Avenue.  And you're going to be in Philly.  Philly on Friday at the Trocadero opening up for Elves, the Mexican Elvis.  Local reference.  Thank you.  The Trocadero right off Arch Street.  Yeah.  So the return of the homeless shopping spree a week from tomorrow. 
[00:54:00]  We're not telling anyone what mall we're going to.  No.  It's going to be a nice surprise for everyone.  It's very secretive.  We keep it secret so that things like, oh, security don't know that we're coming.  We don't want them preparing in advance.  No, no.  We like it to be just like it would be for any other shopper.  Any other holiday shopper.  Weren't we going to have Ziggy sit on Santa's lap and take a picture?  Oh, yeah.  Because they had the Santa.  We did do that.  Yes, we did.  There was a Santa in all the malls.  They have a Santa.  And it almost. 
[00:54:30]  Hold on.  I get all choked up at this park.  Seeing little homeless Ziggy on Santa's lap knowing that he left a probably a brown smelly stain on Santa's leg.  And good news, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ziggy is back drinking.  Oh, that is great.  Congratulations, Ziggy.  Last time we had Ziggy equally as confused but not drunk, which I didn't like at all.  Ziggy stopped drinking for a while, and he just wasn't as good on our show.  He went back to Bud Light, I think.  Yeah.  Keep him on the liquor.  You know, that makes him happy. 
[00:55:00]  So Ziggy's back drinking, and he's in rare form, and he will be leading the charge a week from tomorrow.  Homeless shopping spree, too, coming to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Are we going to get a little Christmas song out of him again?  I hope so.  Remember two years ago, I think we made a nation cry when he sang Silent Night, little homeless Ziggy.  You know, his life maybe didn't go the way we all would like our lives to go.  He ended up in a place he never imagined, but still had the heart to sing a Christmas song with as much spirit as any body that's doing well in life. 
[00:55:30]  Why don't we take a listen?  Oh.  From two years ago.  Get your tissues, people.  I'm ready.  Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs?  I know.  I like all of them.  You want to sing one real fast for us?  I can sing it.  All right, yeah.  Let's go.  Silent night.  All right.  Holy night.  I didn't have him pegged as an alcove. 
[00:56:00]  Brown yon virgin, mother and child.  Holy infant, so tender and mild.  Deep in heavenly peace.  Deep in heavenly peace.  All right.  Wow.  Let's hear it for Ziggy, huh?  All right.  Oh, my God.  I love it with the piano being added now.  It's almost like when Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole did the duet like that. 
[00:56:30]  There's Ziggy somewhere sitting in his own feces right now, yet he is singing a duet.  He's singing along with piano accompaniment.  Brilliant piano accompaniment, by the way.  Thank you, Bobby.  Wonderful.  We can put a drum beat under that and put it out on the next Enigma CD.  I'm sure.  That is fascinating.  An Enigma joke.  Nice.  Thank you.  Give me a bell because they're based out of, I think they're based out of Portland.  Awesome.  See how I heard of Korea?  And we're on in Portland, so there you go. 
[00:57:00]  Nice.  Local reference for Portland.  Someone is requesting Beastie Boys, and I know Richard Cheese, you guys, and the band.  We would love to do some Beastie Boys.  You do a lot of Beastie Boys.  Well, you know, we do.  What do you say we do that space song?  You know what I'm saying there, Bobby?  Give me a C, yeah.  Give me a tempo there, buddy.  Something slow and low.  Yeah.  Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic, intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic. 
[00:57:30]  Another dimension.  Another dimension.  Another dimension.  Mr. Scott, thank you.  Intergalactic, fabulous from the Hello Nasty album.  I love those kids.  I love those kids.  They're very sweet. 
[00:58:00]  Me and Mike D in the fiddle faddle, you know what I'm saying?  I love those kids.  You look 25, dude.  I know.  What am I saying?  I'm a little hopped up right now.  All right.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  This guy sounds like the Paul Schaffer band.  Well, yeah, that's the idea.  The same thing, but we just don't get any money for this.  Good deal, guys.  Do it.  All right, Chris.  There you go.  When Opie said, Ant's been waiting two years, I thought he was going to announce the divorce was friendly.  No. 
[00:58:30]  No, and it would be longer than two years, that's for sure.  You were married to Ziggy?  Yes, me and Ziggy were married.  You're just getting a divorce before the single comes out.  Anthony, Chris is going to bring up a good point, and we're going to talk about something here.  Chris, go ahead.  All right, Chris.  Chris, go.  Hey.  Hey, man.  You're on the radio.  Turn it down, man.  That's a delay.  Go.  Sorry, guys.  Now, listen.  When you guys get these homeless guys in there, they can't be allowed to accept any free gifts.  No free gifts.  They've got to go in there, and they need bonus bucks for who can try on the most lingerie. 
[00:59:00]  You know, that's not what you wanted to talk about.  All right.  You've gotten two of those so far today, Opie.  But he brings up a good point.  He says you guys need more urine soap homeless people.  Yeah.  Last year.  We found out the last time we did a homeless shopping spree.  Our general manager at the time felt like we should be doing a good thing with our little bit,  and they wanted us to use a shelter.  Yeah, if you remember Scott Herman, who used to be the GM here two years ago. 
[00:59:30]  And no one told you and I that that was going on.  No.  We wanted hand-picked, disgusting homeless.  Real homeless.  Right off the street.  Right.  We didn't want some guy who might have had a job and fell on some bad times and ended up at the Y or something like that.  No.  That's still a guy that has the capacity to pick himself up, pull himself up by his bootstraps.  Remember, we brought all the homeless people in here, and instead of having goofy fun,  all of a sudden they're telling us their hard luck stories.  Yeah.  You know, I don't want shelter homeless people. 
[01:00:00]  I've been off coke for 10 days, and this money's really going to help.  I'm like, what the hell happened to our bit?  Well, it turns out Scott Herman went to some shelter and had us get a bunch of people from the shelters that were, you know,  so we would really be helping.  Quite frankly, Ziggy saved the whole homeless shopping spree the first time around.  I don't want the homeless to use the money we give them to get themselves back into society.  I want them buying drugs and booze with them.  That's right.  I want them soaking themselves back in that booze. 
[01:00:30]  So we promise this year these homeless people are going to be extremely homeless.  You don't want the faux homeless.  Yeah.  You want the authentic homeless.  I don't even want the temporary homeless.  Like, they're just a...  I want a guy that I know is going to die in the street.  That's it.  I want a guy that's going to spend his 102 bucks on mouthwash because it's a good buzz.  Right.  He still, even though he has the money, he doesn't even understand how to buy booze.  Wait a second.  What kind of mouthwash is that?  I want to write this down.  Listerine.  No, I'm not kidding.  But we had guys that, you know, it was a very serious thing and they're trying to figure out, 
[01:01:00]  you know, they have like 10 relatives to take care of with 102 bucks.  It's like, what happened to our bitch?  No, no.  I want homeless people, solo homeless, just thrown out by their families.  We got some experts on the case, though.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm hearing reports that this crew is going to be over the top.  A couple of them were arrested, but thank God they're going to be out of jail in time for the homeless shopping center.  Is Rich Voss available?  No, he's not homeless. 
[01:01:30]  Big Al?  Nookie's checking in.  Nookie, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I heard Richard Cheese's version of Nookie last year.  Hey, your name is Nookie.  It is.  Well, that's my nickname now.  Everybody calls me that because I listen to it constantly.  Oh.  And I was wondering if I could hear it now.  Are you hot?  Very.  What do you look like?  Well, what kind of girl do you like? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, see?  She's going to custom tailor her looks to you.  Yeah, this is not how I like the phone sex.  I want you to have a story prepared.  Yeah, go to Mercury Lounge tomorrow night to check out the band and Richard Cheese, and then he'll take a look for himself.  We'll do some Nookie for you right after, right into the next break.  Awesome.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, baby.  Bye.  Later.  Email me a pic.  All right.  Later.  Thanks.  You would not believe some of the chicks.  Email me a JPEG.  Yeah, I've been asking for Jeff, if you will.  If you go to richardcheese.com, and that's not a plug, I'm sincere, at some point, you see this woman.  We can get her on the phone.  She's just got the most amazing, what's the word I'm looking for? 
[01:02:30]  Melons?  Yes.  Arthritis.  Where she's just, and I'm telling you, she came to one of the shows and modeled a T-shirt for us, and we accidentally spilled some water on it, and it was great.  Did you get to the Bang Bus through your website, though?  The Bang Bus is so great.  You know about the Bang Bus?  I know the Bang Bus, baby.  I love that.  We can hang.  Are those guys on the show?  Have they been on the show?  We're going to have to get them on the show.  They're clear.  We're going to get them on the show.  I want to hear the story behind that.  The Bang Bus is awesome.  What I like, it's really the Bang Minivan, which is my favorite part of it. 
[01:03:00]  It's not really a bus, but who cares?  No, who cares at all?  That's the best.  And Bang Minivan, well, actually, that would sound hotter, wouldn't it?  Yeah, kind of.  I like it.  It sounds like something you'd do in Thailand in a whorehouse.  The Bang Bus, you can get to through FoundryMusic.com.  Yeah.  And you can get to FoundryMusic.com by going to OpieAndAnthony.com.  It's a lot of fun.  They seem to drive around and pick up these women, offer them money to perform some type  of sexual favors on them in the Bang Bus.  A lot of them, graphic shots of oral treats and whatnot. 
[01:03:30]  And then they not only, sometimes they give her the money, sometimes they don't give her  the money.  They not only don't give her the money, they steal her purse and kick her out of the Bang  They push her out of the van and then scream at her and push her and let them drive away.  And drive away with her pocketbook and the rest of her money.  They're sweet gentlemen.  Norton said because of the Bang Bus, he's now chafed from the weekend.  I almost pulled a back muscle last night.  Really?  You enjoy the Bang Bus?  I need, I got to, by the way, I'm going to throw out a plug, and I don't care about my 
[01:04:00]  stupid gigs.  My email is TinkleDrinker at AOL.com.  If you have a password, please send it, because the one I was using is no longer good.  It was disgusting how much time I spent on that.  Yeah, cchorny at richardcheese.com on that one.  Oh, there you go.  That's the best one.  That's not your email, is it?  Yeah, anything goes to Richard Cheese.  Now, Jim, do you use, when you use the mouse with your right hand, so you're getting extra  practice with the left hand, then?  Laptop, little button in the middle, I stick a movie on, and I begin.  Steve from foundrymusic.com. 
[01:04:30]  What else do you know about the Bang Bus?  I am stunned that this website exists.  But people are losing it.  It's their favorite website out of nowhere.  It is my favorite website now.  I love this thing.  Yeah, Steve came in one day, a couple of weeks ago, during commercials, and goes, you've got  to see this.  It's like a run it into the other studio.  He's got it on the computer.  And it's women in the Bang Bus doing things to these guys, and then being degraded as they're  kicked or thrown out of this Bang Bus, and their money is stolen from them. 
[01:05:00]  They don't start out on the bus.  They're walking along the street with their groceries, and they're propositioned while  they're on the street, and then they get themselves on the Bang Bus.  Yeah.  Then maybe they partake in a little drink or something.  Right, right.  It might be a little drink or something, and then it always ends up in some very graphic  sexual contact, and then she is heaved from the bus, and her money is taken from her.  Or she's led outside, maybe 20 feet away, then they shove her down on the ground and run  back in the bus.  Right.  And she starts chasing the bus and cursing at them. 
[01:05:30]  The best one was the Puerto Rican woman.  She was probably 40.  She was hot.  And she did what they wanted her to do.  And as she leaves, they not only don't give her the money, but they toss her groceries out  the window.  It's just the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Nice drained bag and throw your groceries out the window.  It is, it is, it's an out there sight, I'll tell you.  It's great.  It is out there.  All right.  Well, why don't you do Nookie into break?  It's Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine.  Hit it, boys.  And Tom Brokaw, definitely after the break.  Check, check, one, two. 
[01:06:00]  I came into this world as a reject.  Look into these eyes, and you'll see the size of these flames.  Dwelled on the past, burning up my brain.  Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain.  Hey, I think about the day my girlie ran away with my pay when fellas come to play.  Now she's stuck with my homies, and she's just a sucker with a lump in my throat.  Like a chump, hey.  Like a chump, hey.  Like a chump, hey. 
[01:06:30]  I did it all for the Nookie.  Come on, the Nookie.  Come on.  So you can take that cookie and stick it up your yeah.  Stick it up your yeah.  Stick it up your yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nookie, everybody.  Isn't that a fabulous tune?  I love it.  And we'll be back with the O&A Show.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You won't win it.  Ah.  O&A, ask for me.  No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, this Richard G, man.  What's the deal, man?  Richard G?  I've been a fan of the show for the longest time.  And you got this Richard G on.  He's just this old Sinatra freaking guy.  Yeah.  He's like Weird Al Yankovic from like the 1920s, huh?  Exactly.  Yeah, just like that.  Isn't that what's on your CD?  Yeah, it says the Weird Al Yankovic of the 1920s.  That's our catchphrase.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're not enjoying the musical stylings of Richard G's and Lounge Against the Machine? 
[01:07:30]  Not really, man.  It's just like a rip-off name for Rage Against the Machine, dude.  No?  Oh.  Wait a minute.  That's brilliant.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wow.  You know, I didn't even notice this.  We could use that.  You are ripping off Rage Against the Machine, Rage Against the Machine.  You know, I'm glad you pointed that out.  Adam, we can't get anything past you, my friend.  I hope their lawyers aren't listening.  I'm going to get a lawsuit.  You know what, dude?  You're right, though, because I recognize a couple of these songs from other performers. 
[01:08:00]  They sound kind of familiar vocally.  No, no.  Really?  I think some of the words might have come from others.  You're just a cover band.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a second.  That guy sounds like he was smoking a hash pipe.  Oh, man.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hit it, boys.  Oh, oh, oh.  This is a little song by Weezer.  Written by a fabulous lyricist, Mr. Rivers Phoenix. 
[01:08:30]  I can't help my feelings.  I go out of my mind.  These players come to get me because they're like my behind.  I can't love my business when I can't get a trick.  Down on Santa Monica with the tricks of her kids.  Whoa, come on and kick me.  I should have said Busselton for a local reference.  Whoa, come on and kick me.  Whoa, we've all got problems. 
[01:09:00]  Right, San Francisco?  I've got my problems.  I've got my ass wide.  Thank you.  I've got my big cheese.  I've got my hash pipe.  Thank you.  That's a cover song.  Yeah.  See, we take the songs.  Bravo.  You know what we're doing.  Bravo. 
[01:09:30]  Thank you very much.  I'm also a little distracted because we just announced, Anthony, that the homeless shopping  spree returns a week from tomorrow.  It's been two years.  We blew off last year and we're doing it all over again.  And the homeless people this year, we're guaranteeing, will be just messes.  Right.  Okay, and Ziggy will be leading the charge once again as long as we can keep track of  him between now and next week.  But we found a picture of Ziggy on Santa's lap.  Aw, Ziggy and Santa.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  I think if you go to opandanthony.com, you could find the picture of Ziggy on Santa's lap 
[01:10:00]  from the last time we did homeless shopping spree.  Poor Santa.  Aw, there's another guy with Santa.  Criminal.  Wow, that guy.  Boy, all I see are eyes and teeth.  Wow.  I saw that guy on a Greyhound bus a couple months ago.  Nice call back.  Thank you.  With, I think, one of his brand new jackets that he had just bought, one of the homeless  guys.  Yeah, we got a lot.  Wow.  Oh, all the pictures are up from the last time we did it. 
[01:10:30]  Look at all the pictures.  That's Grey Wolf.  Ziggy leading the charge up the stairs with a thousand people behind him, Anthony.  That's great.  That's on the Wall of Fame.  That's on the Wall of Fame if you go to opandanthony.com?  Yeah.  All right.  And there's Grey Wolf with the girl he picked up.  We actually gained a homeless person, Richard.  Yeah.  On the way back, there was one more homeless person.  They actually got on the bus and came back.  Some chick.  That's nice.  There you go.  So, a week from tomorrow, we do it again.  We are not announcing this year what mall we're going to. 
[01:11:00]  No, no.  There you have it.  All right.  Hey, you got a little Christmas song there, Richard Chiefs?  Yeah, we sure do.  What do you say we do that Peanuts song, boys?  Hit it out there, would you?  Yeah.  Christmas time is here. 
[01:11:30]  Christmas time is here.  Happiness and cheer.  Fun for all those children call their favorite time of year.  Hey, look!  Snowflakes in the air.  C-c-c-c-c-carols everywhere.  Older times and ancient rhymes and love and dreams to share. 
[01:12:00]  Say bells in the air.  Gray bells in the air.  Bell-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-ton beauty everywhere.  Yule-tide by the fireside and joyful memories there.  Christmas time is here.  We'll be drawing near  Oh, that we could always see  Such spirit through the year 
[01:12:30]  Oh, that we could always see  Such spirit through the year  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Richard G.  Fabulous.  Thank you so much.  We've got to keep the cop on the line.  He's helping us out once again with the homeless shopping spree.  Hey, gentlemen, gentlemen, how are you?  Pretty good.  I've been combing the streets.  Hey, can we get a little Christmas music in the background  as Keith the Cop talks about the homeless people  he's rounding up for the homeless shopping spree? 
[01:13:00]  All right, go ahead, Keith.  Nice.  I've been combing the streets  and I've been looking for some of our favorite homeless folks.  I did speak with Ziggy today.  Oh, great.  He's in as long as he can remember in a week's time.  Well, keep reminding him.  Yeah, can we tag him or something so you know where he is?  That's the sort of thing that we need.  I mean, last year I think I started looking for them  at about 1 o'clock in the afternoon  when we started at 2 o'clock.  Homeless lowjack.  Now get a GPS on him.  Yeah.  Global position homeless guys.  We might need something like that  because a week's worth of time.  I'm going to have to keep track of them every day. 
[01:13:30]  All right, Ziggy is, you know, he's a piece of work.  We need more pieces of work this year.  We have a second person that will be coming back again.  Greywolf?  No, I haven't found Greywolf yet.  If anyone has a Greywolf sighting,  if they could reach out, we'd appreciate it.  Okay.  There was a guy, Keith.  It was like a telethon.  That's right.  We had a guy, Keith, who I ran into today.  He's still homeless two years later,  and he would like to attend again.  All right.  Do you remember what he bought?  What did he buy when he was there last year?  I think he got a jacket and a pair of boots.  So we can get a description on that. 
[01:14:00]  Just look for the guy  because you know he's wearing the same outfit  that he bought two years ago.  The same exact thing he bought two years ago.  You know how sick this city is, though?  All the homeless guys that got brand-new coats and stuff,  they were robbed for their coats.  Yeah, that's true.  A lot of them, I think Ziggy even got robbed of his.  He got beaten and robbed.  You know, they get nice stuff,  and it's just an imitation for them  to be beaten and robbed for Christmas.  But we do have a couple new people  that I've spoken to who would like to partake.  Some real characters, hopefully.  Are they really disgusting homeless?  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Tell us about them a little bit.  You know, they're the average sort of homeless guy.  A little bit of smell, a little bit of grunge.  But I think they'll fit in quite nice  compared to the crew we had the last time.  Because I remember when Ziggy came in here  a couple of years ago for a homeless shopping spree,  the studio stunk of human feces and urine.  Yeah, I remember he was cleaned up a few months ago,  but he's back on the source again.  Oh, thank God.  Because if you're homeless,  you better be drunk or on drugs  because how the hell could you be sober and homeless? 
[01:15:00]  You'd go nuts.  Better to keep them all tanked up.  Yeah, he doesn't drink the regular stuff.  He drinks the white beer now,  so it's not as bad.  I heard he was trying Listerine for a while,  which is so delicious.  Yeah, it keeps your breath fresh as you get drunk.  But we were trying to keep them...  Keith, the smellier the better.  You said you had two guys that got arrested?  One guy I spoke to yesterday,  and half an hour later,  he someone arrested him.  Oh, damn.  What was he arrested for?  I think he was trespassing or something. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  So we've got to try and keep tabs on them  and keep them out of trouble, but...  How dare they look for warmth somewhere?  They're bastards.  All right.  They'll be happy to be aboard.  And what we're trying to do  is have the homeless guys,  or some of them,  come in Monday  so we can interview them  and talk to them a little bit, Anthony.  Yeah.  And then we'll send them loose  on a bus the following day, Tuesday.  That will be quite the feat  if we can accomplish that one, but...  I can't wait.  Well, we have a...  You know, we used to do two to seven,  so, you know...  Yeah, the extra hour.  We don't have much time,  so we're going to have to, like,  pre-interview them the day before, I think.  All right.  We'll work on it. 
[01:16:00]  All right, Keith.  I'll speak to you guys soon.  As you find homeless guys,  you've got to call us and tell us,  you know, about them and stuff  so we can get psyched.  You got it, pal.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Keith the cop.  Hey, a lot of people loving Richard Cheese.  It was very sweet.  Chris, what's up?  Oh, hey.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, that Cheese Whiz guy sucks.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, my friend.  Come see our show tomorrow night  at the Mercury Lounge.  It's...  Mercury Lounge.  Have you ever heard his version of Rape Me? 
[01:16:30]  Apparently not.  Chris.  He had a heart attack.  He's speechless.  Hold on.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  I just turned it on.  All right.  Shh.  Shh.  Chris.  Hear me out.  Richard Cheese and his band,  they're going to do Rape Me.  I'm going to put you on hold  and then you tell me if you like them or not, okay?  I think you'll like this song.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here they go.  Rape Me.  Hit it, boys.  I'd like to dedicate this song to the ladies.  Rape Me. 
[01:17:00]  Rape Me, my friend.  Come on.  Rape Me.  Rape Me again.  I'm not the only one.  No, no, no.  I'm not the only one.  Let's go to the Ben Franklin Bridge.  My only inside source is your open source.  Thank you.  Appreciate your concern.  You always stink and burn. 
[01:17:30]  Rape Me.  Now, Rape Me, my friend.  Rape Me.  Come on, Rape Me.  Rape Me again and again and again.  Everybody, Rape Me.  Put your hands together.  Rape Me again.  R-A-P-E. 
[01:18:00]  Rape Me.  Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape, Rape Me.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You suck.  You suck.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What do you think?  No, it still sucks.  Yeah.  The best part about that scene on the phone is that you can't hear the piano.  You can't hear the piano on the phone?  No.  All right.  So then you got the acapella version.  I'd love to rape him with that organ he had.  All right.  Rape him.  Ah, there you go.  We'll come to the show tomorrow night. 
[01:18:30]  We're going to be doing that at the second set.  Well, Richard, you can't win them all, right?  No.  You know what?  We were at the show on Saturday night in HFS in D.C.  It's a big radio station concert with all these great rock bands.  And I cannot tell you how loud.  Thanks for talking about the competition, Richard.  We're on Jazz K, though, right?  Yeah.  Now that we're on in Washington, and we're slowly trying to build a following.  Not many people listening.  It's always great to.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to.  Talk about the great station we're up against.  You can take back two of my bells.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  But we played the show, and I cannot tell you how loud the you sucks were from that audience.  It was a huge, just a writhing pit, a mosh pit of just, you suck, you suck, which is very sweet. 
[01:19:00]  We love that.  All right.  But, no, I love the JFK, and I mean that.  Okay.  Our buddy Gary's on the line.  11-year-old Gary.  Gary!  Hey, guys.  What's up, Gary?  I wanted to say, on a Friday, Friday, I was on the bus to go home, and there was a wowing on my bus.  There was a wowing on your bus?  There were these three girls, eighth grade, showing each other dongs, mooning people in the back, and showing their boobs. 
[01:19:30]  Gary, exactly where do you catch that bus?  Exactly where?  No, it's my school bus.  Now, wait a minute.  On your school bus, they were showing their area?  Yep.  Interesting.  How about that, Norton?  Again, where can you find this bus?  And again, I said to my cousin, because he rides home, I said, this is the best bus ride I ever took because of that.  Well, congratulations, little Gary. 
[01:20:00]  Gary, you're wowing.  Was that the first time you ever saw little boobies?  No.  Oh.  Silly me.  11, I thought, maybe.  Are you digging Richard Cheese and...  He's great.  Lounge Against the Machine?  He's great.  You're a hit with the kids there, Richard.  Yeah, they actually love us.  All right.  Well, thank you, Gary.  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  All right.  All right, please.  I like the bus sound that Anthony makes better.  Let me hear that.  All the...  No.  That was...  That's when you're on the bus.  That's all you hear.  And it's going down the road, like, and tilting forward and back. 
[01:20:30]  I've been on here 10 minutes.  It seems like three hours.  Bobby, play Magic Bus for me.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Gonna see my baby, yeah.  All riding that Magic Bus.  Thank you.  All right.  And Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know, at first, I thought that Richard Cheese was pretty good.  Yeah.  But I've reconsidered.  He really does suck.  Thank you.  Wow.  I think Bill Murray did it better on Saturday Night Live. 
[01:21:00]  Well, yeah.  We're in big legal trouble with him right now.  He's going to sue us.  I hope he wins.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Come see our show tomorrow night and also in Philly on Friday.  Well, you're getting rave reviews here.  Let's talk to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  Listen, Lounge Against the Machine should be  The Lounge in Front of a Speeding Epic Train.  Lounge With My Balls Under a Steam Roller.  Just something.  It is terrible.  That's the next album is The Lounge With My Balls Under a Steam Roller. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, really?  It's coming out.  We have to switch labels.  But, yeah.  Is it going to be the Soprano version?  Yes.  Will it be on an indie label?  It'll be on an indie label.  An indie 500 label.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Lisa, what's going on?  Lisa, give me some love, baby.  Lisa.  Hello?  Hi.  Yeah, what's up?  I just want to say nobody should be, you shouldn't listen to those guys because you are so hot.  Thank you, Lisa.  You could rape me, baby, because I am so turned on by hearing you say it.  That'll hold up in court, by the way. 
[01:22:00]  It's an oral agreement.  If they say it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would love that.  Lisa, are you coming to the show tomorrow night at the Mercury Lounge?  I can't, but that's why I want your website, so I could get a CD of yours.  It's richardcheese.com.  You can also buy the CDs in stores all over New York and Philadelphia, and name another  city that they open and anything the show's on.  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  All right.  I love Cleveland.  Thank you.  Love you.  Right back at you, baby.  There you go.  My mother, Lisa.  Isn't she fabulous?  By the way, it's not rape if they blink twice for yes. 
[01:22:30]  Pete, what's up?  Oh, my God.  Pete, what's going on?  Oh, not much.  How about you guys?  We're hanging out.  I want to know if Lounge does any Aussie covers.  Oh, yeah.  Jim, we understand Jim Norton here is a big Aussie fan.  Oh, yes.  Bobby, you know any Choo Choo Train songs?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Scooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-dooby-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[01:23:00]  We're going off those rails on that crazy train.  On that crazy train.  Thank you.  No, we don't know any Ozzy.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  That really hurt.  Yeah, it sucked, didn't it?  That'll really get the people behind you now.  I need to call in and say I suck to me.  That stunk.  I know.  I'm sorry about that.  You know what?  Let me work on another Ozzy number for you.  We'll have it ready.  Some old Sabbath, maybe? 
[01:23:30]  A little bit of the universe just to straighten me out.  Let me see what I can do.  All right.  Thank you.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  One, two, three, four, four, four, five.  Hold naked girls.  Hold naked girls.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Hold porno.  Hold porno.  It's not good for you.  It's not good for you.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:24:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Richard Cheese.  My band, Lounge Against the Machine, I'm the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'd like to do a number for you by a special cat named Trent Fresno and his fine band, Nine Inch Nails.  You let me violate you.  You let me desecrate you.  Yes, you do.  You let me penetrate you. 
[01:24:30]  You let me complicate you.  Help me, I broke apart my insides.  Help me, I've got no silver set.  Help me, the only thing that works for me.  Help me get away from myself.  I want to F you like an animal. 
[01:25:00]  I want to feel you from the inside.  I want to F you like an animal.  Oh, my own existence is fun.  You get me closer to God.  Yeah, closer.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Erin from Boston has something to say.  Erin, what's going on? 
[01:25:30]  Hey, I just want to know when he's leaving.  Why?  Are you inviting him to your place?  Seriously, I love you guys.  I listen to you every single day.  And I want to change the channel.  I've never wanted to change the channel.  Oh, no.  Oh, Erin.  I've been through 20 minutes of commercials for you guys.  This guy sucks.  Erin?  Yeah.  We don't know how to tell him to leave.  I know.  It's tough.  You won't leave?  Erin, seriously.  I mean, I know what you're saying.  Maybe it's my voice today.  Or maybe it's just...  But, you know, these are great songs.  And we're just trying to sing them the way they were meant to be sung.  Where's the love?  Where is the love?  It's not funny. 
[01:26:00]  You guys are supposed to be funny.  Erin?  Yeah?  How do you tell him to leave?  I don't know.  Just don't let him sing anymore.  All right, Erin.  You know what?  I'll make you a deal.  If you come to my show tomorrow night and you come on stage and dance with me,  during our cover of Guerrilla Radio by Rage Against the Machine,  I'll leave in ten minutes, I swear.  Yeah, right.  I'm serious.  There's your show.  I'm from Boston.  Yeah.  Erin, do you have maybe a request?  Maybe something you'd like to hear?  Oh, my God.  No.  Nothing.  Thank you.  We don't know what to do with this guy. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, I know what you mean, baby.  How about a little suck my kiss for Erin?  Oh, yeah?  Sure.  A little red hot chili peppers.  I think you'll like this one.  This is a really faggy show today.  We got the French chef bringing in a gingerbread house with little gingerbread.  Cute gumdrops.  Gingerbread.  He's got gumdrops on the damn thing.  Gumdrops.  Everyone's eating it.  It took him three days to make the thing, and now we got Richard Cheese.  Three days, and then the Nazis moved in, and I just let them stay.  And they were working backwards, as always, right?  In order to make that, do you actually have to have a guy rubbing a mule on your face? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  At all times, my friend.  At all times.  What do you think I used to do all the stuff on?  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  I've been eating that all day.  I don't know if that's a good idea.  Richard, I'm sorry you had to hear that.  No, no, it's okay.  Erin, this one's for you.  Suck my kiss, boys.  And then Tom Brokaw.  Should've been, could've been, would've been dead if I didn't get the message going to my head. 
[01:27:30]  I am what I am.  Most mother effers don't give a damn.  Oh, baby, think you can.  Be my girl, I'll be your man.  Someone full of fun, do me till I'm well done.  Little bull feet coming from my stun gun.  Beware, take care.  Most mother effers don't give a damn.  Oh, baby, please be there.  Suck my kiss, cut me my share. 
[01:28:00]  Hit me, you can't hurt me.  Suck my kiss.  Kiss me, please pervert me.  Stick with this.  Is she talking dirty?  Give to me, sweet, sick of this.  Your mouth was made to suck my kiss.  Thank you.  Yes.  Erin, do you still need me? 
[01:28:30]  No, she's long gone.  She hung up on.  She's on the way to the show tomorrow night.  She's long gone, man.  No, seriously.  We tried, but thanks for having us on.  We couldn't turn her around.  No, but we know we suck, and that's why we're here.  Thank you.  All right, we've got to talk about Tom Brokaw, Anthony.  Yeah, it seems the competition's really heating up between him and Dan Rather.  Hopefully, you've been following the saga on our show the last few months.  Yeah.  Well, the latest, Dan Rather.  Oh, listen to this. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, he's ripping me off.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  That's pretty good.  That's wonderful.  All right, the latest on Dan Rather.  Well, Dan wants to go to, I think he is in Afghanistan, right?  Is he over there already?  No, I don't think so.  I know he wants to go really badly.  He might be, like, on a border.  I don't even know where Dan is right now, or where Tom is right now.  Well, basically, Dan Rather wants to go over there to do some reporting. 
[01:29:30]  Mm-hmm.  And now Tom Brokaw, very pissed off, because now, once again, Dan Rather has one up on him.  Yeah, I mean, that's the place to be if you're a reporter.  And it turns out it's a lot more dangerous.  Journalists, eight journalists have been killed.  One American's been killed in combat.  So, you know, the journalist outdoing the military as far as getting themselves killed.  So I don't know if it's safe.  And Geraldo's running around with a cowboy hat.  Good.  Geraldo looks hysterical.  Put a target on the top of your head. 
[01:30:00]  Have you seen Geraldo?  He's out there, he's interviewing people, and he's got this big cowboy hat on.  I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride.  I'm wanted dead or alive.  No, no, no, no.  Look at Russell Cheese.  Hey, we know that one.  We know that one.  That's okay.  It's okay.  Sorry, baby.  So, I don't think it's safe, though, for Tom Brokaw, who's 61 years old, to be a trotting  ... picture your grandpa out there trotting across the desert looking for a story. 
[01:30:30]  He wants to be by a marine base at Kandahar, one of the airstrips that's there that was  made into a marine base.  And he wants to hang out with the marines.  With the marines, sure.  And I guess get the story.  Well, he wants to get it before Dan Rather, because they're in a fierce competition with  each other lately.  Yeah, that's what it seems to be.  And Peter Jennings, well, he's a pussy.  Peter Jennings is the biggest pussy in the world, while me and Dan Rather fight it out  to see who's going to be an Afghanist man. 
[01:31:00]  Afghanist man.  Peter Jennings wants to stay home.  He's a panty waist.  What's the matter, Jennings?  Are you quitting on me?  Are you quitting on me, Jennings?  Come back to NBC Nightly News.  Jennings, are you quitting on me?  Then quit, you slimy little walrus looking piece of... 
[01:31:30]  Get the...  off my obstacle.  Get the...  down off my obstacle now.  Move it.  I'm going to rip your...  off so you cannot contaminate the rest of the world.  I will motivate you, Jennings.  You short...  every...  on the Congo.  Hey, that was from a movie, Mr. Brokaw.  Hey, I'm inspired by the marines here.  Well, I hope to be inspired by them. 
[01:32:00]  when I broadcast a lot in person  from the marine base at Canada.  Well, Dan Rather's...  In Afghanistan.  Dan Rather's pretty close to broadcast live from Afghanistan.  Well, I've got a problem with Dan Rather, too.  I'm broke out NBC Nightly News.  My mission with Rather is to seat up the Nunk River  in the Navy patrol boat,  pick up Rather's path 
[01:32:30]  in New Bang Ba.  Follow it and learn what I can along the way.  When I find Rather,  I will infiltrate his team  by whatever means available  and terminate Rather's command.  Terminate Rather's command  with extreme prejudice.  Tom, that's...  That son of a bitch.  That's...  That's from a movie.  I don't recall any of that.  I'm inspired  just the thought of being over there  and saying things  and firing weapons  and helping the marines  over there.  It just gets me hot. 
[01:33:00]  I feel hot.  That's all I want to do.  Hey, look out.  Here comes the enemy.  A 12-foot...  12...  12...  He's coming right in front of us.  You know,  it just makes me feel so good.  Imagine me saying that.  Tom Brokaw,  NBC Nightly News,  live from Afghanistan.  You want to be right in the middle of the action.  I want to be right in the action.  I want to...  If somebody gets hit...  Yeah.  You take a look at this lump of...  Remember what he looks like.  You... 
[01:33:30]  Up in a firefight  and I goddamn guarantee you  a trip out of the bush  in a body bag.  Out here...  You keep your...  Wired tight at all times  and that goes for you...  For brains.  You don't sleep  on no...  Ambush.  And the next son of a bitch  I catch copping Z's in the bush,  I'm personally going to take an interest  in seeing them suffer.  I f*** you not.  Doc, tag him and bag him.  I'm inspired. 
[01:34:00]  Just the...  Being there.  Look at that.  Wait.  Do you smell that?  Uh...  That's napalm, so...  Nothing else in the world  smells like that.  I...  I...  I'm attracted to the smell  of napalm in the morning.  You know, one time  we had a hill bomb  for 12 hours.  When it was over,  I walked up.  We didn't find one of them.  Not one stinking dink body.  The smell, you know that?  Gasoline smell. 
[01:34:30]  The whole hill  smelled like...  Victory.  Someday,  the store's gonna end.  Tom, you're not in the Marines, though.  You're just a newsman.  This is wonderful.  I love it.  I love being with the Marines.  God has a...  For the Marines.  Because we kill  everything we see.  He plays his games,  we play ours.  To show our appreciation  for so much power,  we keep having  a pact with fresh souls. 
[01:35:00]  God was here  before the Marine Corps.  So you could give  your heart to Jesus,  but your ass  belongs to the Corps.  You're not part  of the Marines.  I feel like it.  I'd love to go over there.  Look out, look out.  I'll throw my body  on a hand grenade.  And my brother,  Marine, Marine, Marine, Marine.  I love the military.  Yeah.  Even though I'm  61 years old, 
[01:35:30]  it doesn't matter.  I would just  love to get in there  and get a piece  of the action.  Get Osama's ass.  Yeah, why don't you  go in the caves  and try to hunt him?  I'll do that.  I'll be a tunnel rat.  Yeah?  Here I am,  Tom Brokaw.  And I'm in  the tunnels  here in Afghanistan.  And I'm ready  to kick some ass.  Come on out, Osama.  Come on,  I see you.  I see you.  I didn't start this.  I didn't draw  first blood. 
[01:36:00]  You started this.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Adrian.  Oh, time.  That was a fighting movie.  What are you doing?  It's a regular movie.  That's Rambo.  Yeah, blow him up.  Sand monkeys.  Kill all the sand monkeys.  There you go.  Kiss my ass.  Tom Brokaw,  NBC Nightly News.  I can't wait  to get over there. 
[01:36:30]  I cannot wait  to get over there.  You  tools.  Rather,  rather,  I'm going to give you  three seconds,  exactly three  seconds.  Swipe that stupid  looking grin  off your face,  or I will gouge  out your eyeballs  and skull  you.  Wow!  The answer  to that one,  you pussy boy,  rather.  Rather,  you best  un-  yourself  and start 
[01:37:00]  me Tiffany  Cufflings,  or I will  definitely  you up.  Rather,  you will give  your rattle  a girl's name,  because this is  the only  you people  are going to get.  Your days  of banging  old Mary Jane  Rottencotch  through her  pretty big panties  are over.  Rather,  I just 
[01:37:30]  love being  there.  I can  smell it.  Smell it  in the air.  Can you?  I can't say it,  but I can  smell it.  Wow.  Let me  hear you  pronounce  Taliban,  Tom.  The bad  guys.  That's  how  absolutely  Tom Brokaw,  NBC,  and nightly  news. 
[01:38:00]  This ain't  your show,  Elias.  You sound  motivated,  Mr. Brokaw.  Well,  I am.  Rather was  full of  s**t.  Rather was  a crusader.  Now,  I ain't got  no problem  with a man  who does  what he's  sold,  but when  he don't,  the machine  breaks down.  And when  the machine  breaks down,  we break  down.  And I  ain't gonna  let that  happen from  any of  you,  not one. 
[01:38:30]  Looks like  Mr. Brokaw  watched a lot  of movies  on the  train from  Boston.  I have no  idea what  you're talking  about.  You've got a  lot of DVDs  in your back  pocket,  huh,  Mr. Brokaw?  Well,  I'm inspired.  Tom Brokaw,  NBC nightly  news is  inspired by  victories of  the Americans  in the past.  Humberkaw, 
[01:39:00]  NBC nightly  news live  from Afghanistan.  Tom,  how do you  lead the  women and  children?  No,  it's how  can you  shoot innocent  women and  children?  The answer  is you just  don't lead  them as much.  If they run,  they're VC.  If they stand  still,  they're well  disciplined  VC.  Rather, 
[01:39:30]  get your  boots on.  And the  next time I  catch you  spraying  skeeter  repellent on  your feet,  I'm going to  court march  your nigger  ass.  Whoa,  Tom.  You can't  say that  on the  nightly  news.  Out in the  field when  death is  around the  corner,  you say  what you  want.  Tom Brokaw,  NBC nightly  news.  Tom,  can I  interrupt you?  Sure.  We have  Earl from  the emergency  room. 
[01:40:00]  Oh,  then we  must get  to Earl  from the  emergency  room.  Our own  black  Earl.  We were  talking about  him earlier.  He's puking  blood and  crapping  blood at  that point.  Very sick.  In the  emergency  room.  Earl.  Hello,  boys.  How are you,  Earl?  I could  be better,  guys.  Earl,  let us  know exactly  what's  happening.  Um,  what is  playing in the  background?  What are you  talking about?  Music from  heaven.  Yeah,  you must be  on some  good drugs.  You don't  have anyone  here today. 
[01:40:30]  Don't stop  it.  What's the  matter?  Um,  I have an  ulcer.  An  ulcer.  Doesn't that  mean you're  stressed out  at your  job or  you've been  working hard?  Most people  get ulcers.  No,  it has nothing  to do with  it.  Is it  another curse  of the  black man?  No.  Like high  blood pressure  and heart  disease?  No.  No?  It is a  bleeding  ulcer.  You have  a bleeding  ulcer and  you were  vomiting  blood?  Yeah,  it was  coming out  of both  sides  pretty hard.  And how  did you  get this  bleeding  ulcer?  No idea. 
[01:41:00]  That's what  they're trying  to figure  out.  It's  from yelling  and screaming  a lot,  Earl.  No,  not at all.  You get  ulcers from  worrying too  much and  stress and  all that.  Yeah.  No,  not at all.  That's one  of the first  things they  told me.  Earl,  is it  from a  diet of  fried  chicken  and  what not?  Myth  number  two.  It has  nothing  to do  with  diet.  Well,  then how  do you  get an  ulcer?  I don't  know.  You  don't  know.  Actually,  you catch  it from  various people  who are 
[01:41:30]  Oh,  is that  it?  Yeah,  it's like  a viral  infection  that gets  passed in  stressful  workplaces.  That's  impossible.  It's true?  That is  absolutely  not true.  I must  blame  Anthony,  though.  I caught  his cold.  Everyone  caught  his cold.  I caught  his cold  and they  had to  stick a  tube up  my nose  to go  down  my throat.  Why?  It must  have been  a garden  host.  Oh,  hey,  Earl.  Earl,  with the  cursing.  with the 
[01:42:00]  cursing.  I just  hope four  seconds went  by before  you cursed  me so  everyone got  to hear  the line.  A little  inside humor  for everyone.  So,  Earl,  where are  you right  now?  Are you  in a  room?  I'm  still in  the  emergency room.  You're  still in  the  ER.  And  someone  is  saying  it's  your  period  fag.  Plug  it up.  Plug  it up.  Plug 
[01:42:30]  it up.  Pull  the  string.  Earl,  Ernie's  saying  that  you're  period.  Earl,  that's  how you  get  the  ulcer.  It's  all that  cursing.  Relax.  Earl,  it's  supposed  to be  though.  I  do  know  the  ulcers  is  supposed  to  be  brought  on.  Do  you  think  you  have  a  lot  of  anger?  No,  not  at all.  Maybe  you  wake  up  remembering  that  uncle  and  that  little  bottom  assault?  No.  Earl,  they  ruled  out  the  thrax  though,  right?  Yeah.  Did  they  check  you  for  the 
[01:43:00]  thrax?  I have  no idea.  Still  getting  blood  work  done.  Engine  51,  squad  51.  Get  Earl.  He's  bleeding  from his  butt.  What's  the matter,  Earl?  Are  they  going  to  admit  you,  Earl?  Yeah,  I'm  going  to be  here  a  couple  of  days.  Oh,  he's  got  a  vacation.  Earl  gets  a  vacation  is  what  this  amounts  to.  You're  getting  a  vacation  from  your  vacation,  Earl.  Earl,  the only  man  that  gets  a  10-year 
[01:43:30]  vacation.  I  had  a  tube  run  up  my  nose,  which  was  agony.  I've  had  two  rectal  probes.  And  that was  before  you even  got to  the  hospital.  Thank  you.  Good  night.  Hey,  Earl,  is  it  true  Scotso's  broadcasting  from  the  bed  next  to  you?  No,  stop  it.  Everybody  knows  that's  I missed.  Yeah,  you're  going to  have to  come  into  work  with  the  oxygen  mask  on  like  I missed.  Hey,  baby,  when I  fell off  of  Destiny,  my horse,  I wore  oxygen  mask to  the radio  station,  and now  Earl's 
[01:44:00]  going to  do the  same  thing,  baby.  They  told me  I lost  a third  of my  blood.  Stop it.  They didn't  lose a third  of your blood.  Stop it.  They told me.  Really?  Anthony from  West Orange  writes,  Hey,  congratulations,  Earl,  you're not a  virgin anymore.  Earl,  if you  lost a  third  of your  blood,  you would  not be  talking to  us right  now.  I'm just  saying what  they told  me.  Did they  check you  for sickle  cell?  No.  Oh,  my God.  What,  what,  are you in 
[01:44:30]  a good  hospital?  I won't  give out  the hospital  yet,  but is  it reputable?  Yeah,  it's very  reputable.  I'm still  in the  process of,  my family  knows less  than you  guys know  that.  Hey,  you want  the psychobar  to deliver  a bucket  of chicken?  And this  isn't a  black joke,  it goes  back to  a callback  from a  show about  two years  ago.  I will  say,  I know  I'm feeling  better because  my appetite  is,  I'm so  hungry right  now.  Yeah,  have a bunch  of orange  juice and  other acidic  stuff.  It really  hurts. 
[01:45:00]  It doesn't  give me  anything.  No,  Earl,  you get  the ulcer  from stress.  Yep.  I don't  care what  they say.  Everyone I've  ever known  that had an  ulcer,  they're stressed  out people.  No,  I mean,  I've found  that a lot  about the  old.  But Earl,  how is the  probe,  man?  Yeah.  What do  they do?  Do the  doctor put  both hands  on your  back?  You know  what it  is?  It's a  glorified,  I don't  know if I  could say  this.  It's a  glorified  what?  Wiping  of your  ass.  Oh,  stop it.  I swear to  God.  Wait,  wait,  Earl,  I don't 
[01:45:30]  even know  if I  could say  that.  Earl,  hold on,  let me  ask you  something.  Did  they check  your  colon?  No.  They  didn't?  The  very  outside.  Yes.  And what  did they  do?  They  kind of  wiped the  culture  off or  something?  Yeah,  it was  basically  the  equivalent  of that.  Earl,  didn't you  go to the  future to  see this  coming or  what?  No.  I saw  this coming.  I hopped  into my  DeLorean, 
[01:46:00]  I went  into the  future and  I saw  me laying  in a  hospital bed.  But I  couldn't  talk to  me because  that would  cause some  kind of a  paradox which  might destroy  the world.  But I  saw them  taking a  wipe and  a culture  off of my  bottom and  I just  thought I  was in  for a  good night.  I popped  in right at  the point  where the  nurse was  wiping me  and I  said,  oh,  our black  girls are  in for a  good time  in the  future.  I didn't  know I  was in  the hospital.  I just  saw me in  bed.  It's a  curious thing.  Make one  man weep,  make another  man sing.  Now I 
[01:46:30]  gotta get  back to the  future and  stop eating  so badly and  being so upset  at my  nothing job.  Hold on,  Steve says that  ulcers caused  by stress  is a  myth.  Steve,  what do  you know?  What do  you know,  Steve?  What I  know is  that this  might help  Earl out a  little bit.  Most ulcers  are caused  from a  bacteria called  Helicobacter  pylori.  Ah.  Yeah,  and they  can be  taken care of  with antibiotics.  That's in  most cases,  like 90%  of cases.  Earl,  were you  with any  hookers with  that name? 
[01:47:00]  No.  All right,  so it's  caused by a  bacteria?  Yeah,  in most cases.  Yeah.  I'm a  biology major,  so we  learned that  in my  papology class.  All right,  thank you.  Blind Dave  has something  to add to  this.  Blind Dave.  Oh,  great.  Hey,  how's it  going,  guys?  Are you  the Blind  Dave?  Yeah.  Where you  living now,  bro?  I'm up in  Massachusetts,  man.  Oh,  that's right.  You guys  have been  keeping me  laughing,  man.  I had  back  surgery two  weeks ago.  Oh,  you are  a mess.  What  happened to  your back?  I had a  can I  stop?  Hold on.  I had a disc 
[01:47:30]  removed.  You didn't  see that  coming?  You had a  disc removed?  Yeah.  Why?  Herniated.  Herniated disc.  Didn't have  anything to do  with somebody  punching you,  did it?  What?  Didn't have  anything to do  with somebody  else punching  you,  did it?  No,  I've been  sober,  man.  Yeah,  you sounded.  Yeah,  the last time  Blind Dave  called,  he got his  driver's license.  Yeah,  I hit the  wall at that  last show,  man.  Let me tell  you something,  Blind Dave,  you might be  sober,  but when you  have back  surgery done,  I'm sure  you're on  some really  good drugs.  Oh,  yeah.  See, 
[01:48:00]  I'm sober,  man.  That stoner  chick who  called in,  she goes,  it's oxy  something,  it's oxy  cotton.  Is that  what you're  on?  It's like  a sister  to morphine.  Great.  It's on  the morphine.  All right,  Dave.  No,  but I know  what Earl  has.  Yeah.  I had that  like six  months ago,  and they  didn't find  out until  they did  a colonoscopy  and a  scope down  the stomach.  They thought  I had a  bleeding  ulcer.  It's  something  called 
[01:48:30]  diverticulosis,  which is  from not  eating  roughage.  Hey,  Earl,  do you  have a  colonoscopy  in your  future?  No,  they're  going to  scope my  stomach  tomorrow.  They do  that first  to me.  They do  that first,  and then  if they  don't find  anything  wrong,  Earl,  I think  go in your  DeLorean and  go a little  bit into the  future and  tell us what  you see.  Is Earl  going to  get the  pipe in?  Oh,  my Lord,  I'm seeing  me getting  the pipe.  Hold on,  Earl,  we've got  the pipe  song for  you.  We'll play  the pipe  song for  you.  Hold on,  everybody.  Richard Cheese,  the pipe  song. 
[01:49:00]  Well,  if you  turn 53  and you  find it  hard to  pee,  you  need  the  pipe.  Or if  your prostate  is  rolling on  a  photographic  home  with  the  pipe.  Let's  go!  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  If  it  can  mean,  use a  lot  of  Vaseline 
[01:49:30]  with  the  pipe.  And  you'll  know  when  it's  starting  because  you'll  feel  your  bugs  part  with  the  pipe.  You'll  be  bonged  like  robo  when  the  doctor  feds  you  over  with  the  pipe.  Hey,  let's  go!  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  Let's  go get  the  pipe.  And 
[01:50:00]  there's  half the  pipe song.  For some  reason,  we used to  play it all  the time,  but we  can't play  it now.  It gets  dumped out  of.  There was a  waste of  time.  Thank you.  I'm so  glad the  communication  has  gotten  better.  That's  good.  Thank  you.  Thank  you.  Thank  you.  Oh,  look  out. 
[01:50:30]  Flying  microphone.  Isn't  this exactly  what we  discussed?  I'm so  glad things  have gotten  better.  If we  can't play  something in  its current  form, you  got to tell  us so we  can bleep  out all  the bad  words, you  twat.  All right.  Well,  there it is.  Earl might  actually have  to get  that, though.  Get what?  No one knows  what.  A big pipe.  Six to eight  times, Anthony.  Wow.  Oh, my  God.  Blind Dave. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  All they  could do  for it is  you take  prescription  antacids and  you have to  be on like  the strictest  you can't  eat nothing  that tastes  good diet  and eat  vegetables.  Is that  what roughage  is, dude?  Like lettuce  and stuff?  Vegetables?  Is that  roughage?  Yeah.  You got to  eat celery  and carrots.  Nothing with  seeds, no  nuts and no  corn.  Ever.  So Earl's  F'd, huh? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  And your  stomach's  messed up for  like two  months.  Wow, Earl.  That don't  sound good.  Yeah, I'll be  afraid.  You don't  sound like  crap.  And if it  goes into a  worse state,  then they got to  remove like a  foot of your  colon.  Can we  give it away  on the  arrow?  Earl's  colon.  I'd be  home as  early as  Thursday.  Could  someone eat  it for  Aerosmith?  Put it on a  slice, slice it 
[01:52:00]  nice and thin.  Good to know  someone else's  life sucks as  bad as mine did  six months ago.  Hey, Dave, at  least Earl can  still see, okay?  Uh-huh.  Hey, Earl.  Well, I could  say something that  Norton would  probably laugh  after that, but...  What?  What?  No, I won't  go there.  He's going to  say at least  I'm white.  I didn't say it.  That's what he  was thinking.  I read your  blind mind.  You know  white is  white.  I wouldn't  say that.  Hey, guys.  Guys, blind  back surgery.  Yes, sir. 
[01:52:30]  I have to  give up this  phone.  Oh, all right.  Are you wearing  black in the  hospital?  Yes, I am.  Are they going  to give you a  black gown where  your black ass is  going to hang  out the back?  No.  They have to  go and get  special band-aids  for him, too.  Earl.  Yo.  Can we call you  tomorrow, Earl?  Can we call you  in your room?  Uh, yeah.  I'm going to  call Ben later  when they have  me more situated.  All right.  I'll probably be  here all night.  All right.  Hold on,  all right, Earl?  Yeah.  Hope you feel  better, man. 
[01:53:00]  We're thinking  about you, pal.  Poor Earl.  All right.  There goes Earl.  I hate to think  that maybe it was  our measure  the office bit  where he got  so pissed  through the  tape measure  and stormed  out of here  pissed that  might have  put him  over the  edge there.  Pumped a  little of that  stomach acid,  you know?  All right.  Dave, thank you.  All right, man.  Later, guys.  All right.  Aw.  Poor Earl.  Earl.  I can't believe  they dumped  out of that  song.  Eh, I can. 
[01:53:30]  That doesn't  even surprise  me anymore.  All right,  Ant.  Uh, forget it.  Someone had a  jelly donut line  for Tom Brokaw  and...  Yeah, well,  Earl kind of  was more important  than Tom Brokaw.  All right.  But now in hindsight,  how about Richard  Cheese and Lounge  Against the Machine  plays us to break  here?  You got it.  And I got  something special  for Earl.  Let's do that  Huey Lewis number  we just heard,  boys.  Oh.  Don't take money.  Don't take fame.  Don't need no 
[01:54:00]  credit card to  ride that train.  Earl's in the  hospital and it's  rectal pro time.  But they're gonna  save his life.  That's the power  of love.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good night.  And I gotta go  back to the phone.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's  going on?  I just want to  make sure to warn  you to check under  Earl's eyepatch when  he comes in tomorrow  to make sure he's 
[01:54:30]  not faking.  A la Lion Brian.  Right.  There's one for  New York only.  Very good, Scott.  All right, you  guys suck.  Take it easy.  All right, yeah,  our lying intern.  That's a story we  can definitely retell.  All right, we'll be  back, right?  Yes.  Okay.  It's open.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little  drunk, Anthony.  Go ask yourself,  okay.  Wake up. 
[01:55:00]  Grab a brush and  put on a little  makeup.  Hide the scars  that fade away  that shake-up.  Why did you leave  the keys upon the  table?  You wanted to.  I don't think you  trust in my self-righteous  suicide.  I cry when angels  deserve to die.  Father, father, mother, 
[01:55:30]  father, brother, father,  effort.  Father, into your hands,  I commend my spirit.  Why have you forsaken me?  I don't think you  trust in my self-righteous  suicide.  I cry when angels  deserve to die.  Thank you.  System of a down,  aren't they fabulous? 
[01:56:00]  It's Richard G's  and Lounge Against  the Machine,  our house band  today, Anthony.  Thank you very much.  We're playing the  Mercury Lounge  tomorrow night  right here in  New York City.  And the Trocadero  in Philadelphia  on Friday night  and Vegas,  December 15th  at the Venetians.  Look out,  Vegas!  Thank you.  Yeah.  By the way,  I am really tired  of those  longitude commercials.  Are you?  Yeah.  You don't like  the longer schlong?  No,  a pill to make  your more satisfying  problem. 
[01:56:30]  How about a pill  to shrink your  swelled-out  catfish mouth?  How about  something for that?  Maybe we're not  the problem  all the time.  All right,  maybe the people  will work on that.  Your swelled-out  catfish mouth.  Rotten stalactites  in it.  Why don't you  fix it?  Anthony,  a few things  going on here.  Yeah.  First of all,  we forgot to do 
[01:57:00]  our moment of silence  for George Harrison,  all the other  radio stations  in America.  They did it  at 4.30  and we blew it off.  We were supposed  to meditate  for 60 seconds.  Meditate?  Oh.  At 4.30.  But we couldn't  find a sponsor for it  and that's the reason  why we didn't do it.  Oh, is that it?  That moment of silence  sponsored by...  Launcher 2.  Sponsored by caps  when your hair  is falling out.  Don't you think  with current events  in the world  that maybe the moment 
[01:57:30]  of silence  for George Harrison  is just a little much?  Maybe you can  remember him  with a little  Beatles tune  in the privacy  of your own home  or a car  or something?  Yeah.  If we didn't do  a moment of silence  for the victims  of the Twin Tower thing...  Well, we did.  We did a lot of them  at the ball games  and whatnot.  But not on the radio.  Not this national...  They wanted all  the radio stations  at the same time  at 4.30 to do  the moment of silence.  Yeah.  And if we're not doing it  for the Twin Tower thing,  you're S out of luck.  Am I kind of against  what George Harrison  was all about  and what he believed in? 
[01:58:00]  The whole self-importance thing  I don't think is...  Yeah.  They're going to dump  his ashes  in the Ganges River?  They're going to smoke him.  Is that it?  Just smoke him up.  That's what I heard  in India.  That guy really  got carried away, man.  He took some acid  with some Indian guy  and that was it for him.  That's what I believed  in me whole life.  That was it, man.  Most of them guys  went, screw it.  It was some mushrooms  we took, George.  No, no.  I was truly enlightened  by the whole thing.  Hey, George.  Back off.  Whatever. 
[01:58:30]  This guy lived  his whole life that...  Hare Krishna.  You hear that?  When he got stabbed?  When that guy  came into his house?  Two years ago, yeah.  He pulled the knife out  by the blade.  Got it out of the guy's hand  or something.  His wife beats him  over the head.  He runs out bleeding  on the porch  and starts going,  Hare Krishna,  Hare Krishna.  And then the Shangri-Las  sued him.  Yeah, he was sued again  by the Shangri-Las.  Thank you.  Dulang, Dulang,  she's so fine. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  So we missed  the moment of silence.  And we apologize  to the Beatle fans.  Oh, well.  Well, next moment of silence  they have for him.  We'll do that.  What do you say?  How crazy is this  that Ringo's going  to outlive all of them?  Oh, who saw that coming?  Ringo.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, so that's going on.  And Stalker Patty's here  for some reason.  Why the hell is she here?  I'm getting word  that you played  Blink-182's Wedding?  That is correct.  We performed  at Travis Barker's,  the drummer  for Blink-182's Wedding. 
[01:59:30]  We played his wedding  a couple months ago  in Los Angeles.  And his wife  is smokin'.  Well, of course.  She's like a rock band.  Someone should put her out.  Those guys can't.  Oh, Jesus.  Those guys can't go around  with ugly chicks.  You know, cheesy music,  cheesy humor.  Huddle, huddle.  They were very nice  and they paid us  a crap load of money  to put that cake.  I just flew in from Los Angeles  and boy, are my arms tired.  Oh, oh.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck. 
[02:00:00]  Yuck.  Try the VLB  you're here all weekend.  Thank you.  Chip, you're waitresses.  Yeah.  All right.  What does she want?  I have no clue.  You want to bring  Stark and Patty in?  We had Patty in Friday,  by the way.  We had Mommy,  What Would You Do  for Britney Spears tickets.  The winner was  a fine young lady  who sucked on Patty's  disgusting big hammer toe  and a toenail  that is like a hawk's talon.  I didn't see.  Can I see your...  I never see.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to see it.  I don't want...  I'm going to...  I'm going to walk away. 
[02:00:30]  Last time I was on the show,  I had to look at male boobs  and I don't want to see this toe.  Patty, show Jim Norton  your hammer toe.  Show Norton your hammer toe.  I don't make fun of it.  I just...  Well, I have tights on.  What are you wearing tights for?  Die already.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Frenchy's like,  why don't you die already?  Hey, Patty,  sit down in that chair, right?  Yeah.  Wheel over.  Yeah.  Richard Cheese,  you can move  if you're afraid of Patty's feet.  I'm going to practice it over here.  And let Norton see this.  Sit down  and take your goddamn clothes off. 
[02:01:00]  Speaking of cheese,  wait till you see her toes.  Oh, no.  I won't make fun of it.  Wheel her that way.  Frenchy,  Frenchy,  step out of the way.  You're used to doing that  as a people.  I like that.  Norton.  Wow.  Norton.  Good one.  You know how many people  are counting on you right now  for the comment  that's about to happen?  Well, I hope you can see  through the tights.  No, no.  You've got to take  all that off, Patty.  I've got to go  to the bathroom.  Why?  You stripped in here before?  Go ahead.  Show them your...  Oh, come on.  Show them that...  Let me please... 
[02:01:30]  They believe this is  a homeless shelter.  Just strip in the corner.  They believe it's a homeless  shower thing  that you stayed in  where someone stole  your underwear.  Do you want to just  give me two seconds  inside to get them?  Give me two seconds.  I've got to take  everything off to get  some pants off.  Do you have your wig  tied in a ponytail?  Yeah.  It looks like,  you know when you do  the sumo wrestling  and they give you  that helmet  with the hair on it?  The sumo wrestling  and they put you  in a big fat suit?  That's what her hair  looks like.  Richard, I just washed it  last night,  so I had to put it back today. 
[02:02:00]  Did you put a dryer sheet  in there with it  when you dried it?  You washed your wig?  You're supposed to.  Two or three times a week  because you're wearing it.  Richard, I've got to  explain to Richard.  You have to.  We lost every female  listener we had  when we shaved her head  for U2 tickets.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, look at her head.  Take it off.  Let's see how well  it's growing in.  Yeah, she thought  it was good.  There it is.  Oh, that's pretty good.  That looks better now.  She thought it was  going to grow back  in time for Thanksgiving.  Actually, they have  the same hair, though.  So I overestimated. 
[02:02:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm optimistic.  Yeah, but she's  going to die first.  She sounds like Edith.  Edith's bonker.  You've got the same  hairline as Frenchie.  Oh, my God, I do.  Isn't that beautiful?  Well, just give me a second.  Why don't you go back  here and take your clothes off?  Go and take your  tights off.  Tights.  Don't worry.  No one's going to be  peaking.  Trust me.  Yeah.  What are you wearing  tights for?  She talks slow.  She walks slower.  She's just...  Why don't you go outside  and give me a bus?  She goes, I can't cut 
[02:03:00]  my big toenails  because my hammer toes  make them very sensitive  and it's going to have to  get them without the...  Someone put a new  battery in her.  Steve, do we have a video  of her hammer toes  on foundrymusic.com now?  Yes, we do.  And that girl sucking on him.  What was her name?  And Erin, I believe.  Erin came in  and she was the 19-year-old  mother of a 4-year-old.  Erin wasn't bad.  She was nice.  Cute girl.  To win Britney Spears songs?  Tickets.  Yeah, to our show.  She wanted to take  our 4-year-old daughter,  the 19-year-old girl.  We know some Britney Spears. 
[02:03:30]  Nice.  We sing Britney  in our show tomorrow night.  Do you?  Do that crazy number  real quick.  Yeah, because she turned  20, I think, today.  That is correct.  Oh, look it.  He's taking his clothes  off like Britney.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to show you  some middle.  You drive me crazy.  I just can't sleep.  Me and Britney,  I'm in so deep.  Crazy and it feels  all right.  Loving you keeps me up.  All right. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Britney is such a remarkable  performer and a writer  and a singer  and I really want to  just write up there.  Just love her.  You know what the problem is,  though?  It would be better  if you could actually do it  and not have your lips move  with the music.  I know.  That would be a little  more realistic to the Britney  that we know and love.  I know.  But Britney's old news, man.  We got a new one.  Shakira, whatever her name is.  Oh, yeah.  What, that Spanish girl?  Yeah, that's dancing  in the modern stuff.  She got some John.  She got some junk  in the trunk. 
[02:04:30]  She's got some hip.  Don't she?  Yeah.  She does that little  belly dancing thing.  She was on the SNL  over the weekend.  Nice.  Where I also saw  a ton of Brewer's bits  being stolen.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Classic.  After, we got to talk  about that a little later.  Wasn't Brewer supposed  to call?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're trying  to hunt him down.  But Patty's back, Anthony.  And there you go, Norton.  Look at that.  What is that?  A saucer?  Disgusting.  I glued a goddamn 
[02:05:00]  Fritos corn chip  on my toe toenail.  It looks like Stonehenge.  Oh, it does.  Look, they're all pasty.  She has these pasty feet.  Because they're covered  over all the time.  You got to see it  in the summertime.  They're super white  and the rest of me  is tan.  You don't tan.  Oh, stop it.  If you were one shade light,  you'd have those big pink eyes  like the trolls.  Edward Winner.  Yeah.  It looks like her foot  has an elbow. 
[02:05:30]  She'd have that thing  off her head  with the light  like those deep sea fish.  Like an elbow foot.  Norton nailed it.  It looks like you have  an elbow on your foot.  You don't have that thing.  Sorry.  The more I look at you,  the more I realize  Susan Smith had a point.  What's that?  Well, I don't get it.  Look at those toenails.  I don't get that.  Why don't you go outside  and let the truck  go over your feet?  It would help  a little bit.  That's not nice.  Patty, why don't you  smash his gingerbread house?  Use that big hammer toe  to break that.  I got no power  in my hands. 
[02:06:00]  Hammer toe.  I wish she'd have  a hammer head.  I like the gingerbread.  Bite over it.  I like my arms.  Why don't you die already,  god damn it?  Francie's had a little bit  of beer.  You know how they get.  They drink a little.  It's like,  take out complete.  I don't care.  Wee, wee.  Patty, why are you here,  by the way?  Well, number one,  to find out  what my pedicure's  going to be.  And then Rick's, 
[02:06:30]  you know,  I was supposed  to work on Friday,  but I called up,  you know,  my friend in Princeton  and said,  well, I had to come here.  And he said,  I think it would make up,  you know,  what I would have earned.  Make what up?  So it's my rent.  Make what up?  He said you'd give me  the money if I came here.  We'd give you money?  We told you we'd give you  money if you came here  Friday instead of Friday.  When was that said?  I don't remember  saying that.  It was on Wednesday.  No, it was Wednesday.  Wait, you're saying Wednesday  you called and we said  we would pay you  to come down here? 
[02:07:00]  Patty, you're out of your mind.  When would we ever...  That's what I said.  Does it look like  we're made of money?  You heard wrong.  Well, that's what you...  I said, well,  I'm supposed to work,  but you said,  we need you down here.  We'll give you the money.  Do you think we pay people  to come on this show?  Then why should we pay you?  Well, I would have worked  and made my rent for the day.  So you're saying  what'll happen  if you don't make  that money up?  Then I'm behind in my rent. 
[02:07:30]  And?  And I just moved in.  And?  How much is rent?  Well, I'm paying  $125 a week.  $500 a month?  Yeah, for a room.  Oh, please.  Play that sad  walking away song  from The Incredible Home.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And it's like a dormitory.  I'm there for like  a year or something  until I get some  Section 8  and stuff  that I'm applying for now.  You going on the welfare?  No.  Well, what do you call that? 
[02:08:00]  I'm applying for Section 8.  Section 8.  Isn't that the crazy thing  that Clinger was always  trying to get?  That's what Clinger is, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Radon,  teach me how to run the camp  before you leave.  Emma, look,  I'm wearing ladies' clothing  to try to get out  and get sent home.  Well, if I put...  Henry Blake's plane  spun in  to the Sea of Japan  with no survivors.  Well, you know...  Play the mash theme, Bobby.  Put myself on a waiting list 
[02:08:30]  and then I might get  a nice, like,  apartment for one person  at, you know,  maybe half or a quarter  at the cost  a month.  Half?  So it's welfare?  Well, I don't think so, no.  It's welfare, Patty.  You're going to be  on the welfare?  No.  Nice.  You get food stamps?  That's not what Section 8 is.  You getting the food stamps?  Um, temporarily,  I had them.  Well, now that you're not  working at McDonald's anymore,  how do you eat?  Because I know you're probably  just pilfering the stock  to get through the day. 
[02:09:00]  No, I wasn't.  Eating french fries  like a baby bird  swallowing a regurgitated worm.  And my food stamps are up  in December.  Only not as attractive.  Then I wait a month  and then see if I  still meet income  requirements.  You know, you'll meet  any income requirements.  It's like, oh, gee,  I hope I don't get put  over that tax bracket  this month, this year.  Obviously, you make  any type of aid  you can get.  Why haven't you  done this sooner?  What do you mean?  Because I've gotten  public aid. 
[02:09:30]  You're always out  of a house.  You're always coming here.  I don't have a place.  Guys, can you get me  a place to live?  I tried living  in a birdhouse,  but I kept sliding off  of the squirrel protector  that they put  at the place.  That bird seat looks good  and I learned how  to crack open  the sun flare  with sweets.  I don't apply  for welfare  because I have a job,  you know.  I got a job.  My income is low enough  that I don't qualify.  It's not enough  that your niggas 
[02:10:00]  got to eat.  You know?  Patty, we don't have  any money for you.  What have we got money?  Ouch.  How much do you make a day?  What's it come to?  Well, I just started  working full-time  just this week  and I'm not going to  see that paycheck  and the results of that  until the end of the week.  How much money  are you looking for?  How much challenge  are you looking  to make a week? 
[02:10:30]  Right now,  I make about  $170  after taxes,  $180.  Right.  The rent comes  to $125.  Plus,  I pay another $25  a week  to cover security  that I didn't have  when I moved in.  So, I made a deal  with my landlord.  So, you have $30  a week to live on?  Well, yeah.  Well, I do.  Half of it's in car fare  and then the other half  is I just have  an all-natural food diet.  I don't buy anything  in packages or cans.  I just get vegetables  and stuff  and pasta 
[02:11:00]  and whatever.  I'm fine with that,  you know.  Patty, move into  Frenchie's gingerbread house.  Oh, no.  It's right there.  Perfect size.  Hey, it's raining  and my roof's leaking.  Frenchie,  do you got some icing?  I've got to plug the roof.  Frenchie,  could you come over?  I drop the gumdrop  off my chimney  and it's leaking.  Patty, maybe you shouldn't  worry about your diet.  Yeah.  The food's too expensive  for the money you're making.  Yeah.  Well, spinach doesn't  cost that much. 
[02:11:30]  Ah, got, got, got, got.  It doesn't cost that much.  I don't eat some food.  And she looks like  the olive oil.  Ah, got, got, got, got.  Well, blow me down.  I don't eat some food.  I drink only water.  Oh, olives.  Ah, got, got, got, got, got.  Ah, got, got, got.  Oh, I'm disgusted  by your feet.  It's going to lift up to you.  It's going to lift up to you.  Hey, Patsky.  We have no money for you.  What you say?  You eat some spinach. 
[02:12:00]  Can't you get a job  in a carnival  with those feet?  His job is a can opener  with those feet.  They look like...  You ever see Nosferatu?  They look like his hands.  Yeah.  He's knuckles.  There it is.  Nosferatu's hands.  Oh, my God.  That is sick.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hi, babe.  What's going on?  What's going on?  No, I've been listening  to Patty for quite a while, right?  Yeah.  She sounds very intelligent to me.  Are you going to give her  a free read?  What?  Patty, call me now. 
[02:12:30]  When can't she get  a better job?  Well, I just found  a good job in Godiva.  Good diva.  You could do a nurse's aid course.  You could do something else  that pay you more.  What are you doing there?  Poking holes in the chocolate  with those toes  so they can put the cherries in?  No.  I love the brain.  How will I open these spinach?  Oh, I'll do it on Patsky's Toeskies.  Thank you, Patty.  Hey, Patty, if you don't pay the rent, 
[02:13:00]  you could join the homeless  shopping spree next week.  Patty, she needs to get a better job.  You need to get a better job.  Exactly.  She can do so much more.  Because we're not paying you  your money.  Ouch.  Right in.  No.  Getting you crap.  Moving to the house.  Getting you a dime.  Move again.  Live and learn, Patty.  It's a tough old world. 
[02:13:30]  You're all right with us  not paying you?  Don.  Just don't.  Hi, Opie.  It's only 50 bucks.  You're all right.  Yeah, Cheryl.  What did the tarot card say?  I feel more or less  she just wants a job  that she can stay close to you guys.  She can always get another job  and get a radio  and listen to you guys  just the same.  Patty, didn't you go to college?  Why aren't you using  your college education?  You're working at places like  McDonald's and Gadeeb. 
[02:14:00]  Why don't you get a good job?  What are you educated in?  Speech and theater.  Speech and theater.  Open up a little speech theater shop.  Speech and theater.  Great.  How long did it take you  to take the speech classes?  Yeah.  Two semesters.  Three years.  I'm good.  I'm going to be a speech therapist.  Bunch of little kids.  Hi, how are you?  I was at speech class today. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, my family's taking us  to McDonald's.  I've got to go to speech class  again tomorrow.  I love my teacher, Patty.  She looks like an egg.  This is wonderful.  Here's my sister.  She goes to the same class.  Hi.  This is wonderful.  Wonderful.  I'm over to grab  and get a job at Gadeeb.  Give me Gadeeb.  Speech and theater. 
[02:15:00]  Can you picture that one?  Bunch of little kids  walking around.  Oh, pick me, Patty.  Teacher Patty.  Cheryl has a better chance  of being a speech therapist  than Stalker Patty.  No, she can do so much more.  She's just wasting our time.  We're going on a field trip  to Gadeeb.  Actually, I think I made it  in the wrong thing.  I really should have  made it in business.  I have more of an interest  than that.  Oh, and you do so well  with your own business  and finances.  Every month, 
[02:15:30]  I'm in the red.  All right, well, Patty,  we don't have money for you  and we've got to move on  with the radio show.  So why don't you go outside  and get run over by a bus?  Oh, that's not nice.  That's not nice to do.  Maybe they give you  some money.  What do you think  about that?  You could be a superhero, Patty.  I talked to you again.  You could be a superhero  like Wolverine  with those toes.  Yeah, I'd be like  Patty Wolverine. 
[02:16:00]  Give me some money.  No, I tried to explain  on the way  that I had a chance  to work.  Maybe we didn't understand  what you were saying.  Maybe we misunderstood  what you were saying.  You know, I would.  I thought you said  you had enough  and you were going to  blow it off  and come down  because you wanted  to hang out.  I thought you wanted  to hang out.  You know,  we've got to pay you now  to come and hang out here.  You know.  Patty, thank you.  Why don't you just  get up and walk away.  Play that music.  Thank you, Patty.  Thank you, Patty. 
[02:16:30]  Thanks for coming down.  Thanks a lot.  Here she goes.  Take your hammer toes  and pound a few nails  out that door.  There she goes.  As she walks away.  Oh, her toes ticking  like the velociraptors  on that kitchen floor  in Jurassic Park.  And there she goes.  Bye, Patty.  They're communicating  with each other.  In the submarine 
[02:17:00]  or something.  Oh, and there she goes.  Oh, man.  She's just walking  down the hall.  Play that music,  that walking away music.  I'm going to lose  my place.  There's Patty  walking away.  Empty in it.  That stupid seat.  Wow, Frenchie.  This even got  to Jim Norton's.  What?  Yeah, I feel bad for her.  I really do.  Oh, stop.  She could be part  of our homeless  shopping spree.  Let's give old  Stanley Toes  a little money. 
[02:17:30]  She's still out there.  What is she doing, Rick?  I'm kidding you,  I said, Phil.  Those aren't even  hammer toes.  That's a crowbar toe.  It's bent up so  distorted so bad.  Now she's telling  her herself.  It really is.  Why, why did they  treat me like this?  She's pulling on her  wig out there.  Why did you open  the window?  How much was the wig?  How much did the wig  cost?  It was 50 bucks  right there.  I don't believe.  Eight bucks.  Really?  I was like, really?  Dude, the characters 
[02:18:00]  in Mad Magazine  had nicer feet  than she does.  Rick, what does she  say now?  That wig looks  like a divot.  She went into the  bathroom to put her  tights back on.  I've got to put my  tights back on.  All right.  Well, we should  take a break, Anthony.  All right.  Richard Cheese,  you got one last one?  Yes.  As we say goodbye  to you in the  Lounge Against the Machine?  That's right.  Well, we'd like to  do that song.  I think this will  really help Patty  and everyone.  Let's do that  lotto song.  What do you say?  Boys, you ready out  there?  I know you guys  love this tune. 
[02:18:30]  If I had a million  dollars, if I had  a million dollars,  Tom Brokaw, what if I 
[02:19:00]  had a million dollars?  I would buy myself  a rifle and go kill  some sand monkeys.  We'd take that  limousine.  Yeah, if I had a  million dollars, I'd  cut my hat with it.  I'd be rich.  I'd be rich.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Richard Cheese in 
[02:19:30]  Lounge Against the  Machine, the house  band today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  We'll be at the  Mercury Lounge on  Tuesday night.  Thank you so much  for having us in,  boys.  And for Philly  Friday.  Friday at the  Trocadero.  And seriously, love  you guys.  Thanks.  Wow.  And I mean that.  Thank you.  Good night.  And we'll be back  with the O&A show.  A lot of people on  hold very pissed off  that we're not  giving Patty her  money.  There will always be  retarded idiots to 
[02:20:00]  entertain us with  this stupidity.  Mindless.  Crotch-grabbing Anthony.  Mindless.  Crotch-grabbing Anthony.  People grabbing the  crotches and saying,  suck it.  You'll get Anthony  show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  And we're back  with the O&A show.  In the studio,  Jim Norton.  Frenchie with his  gingerbread house.  Richard Cheese has  left the building. 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  That was a lot of fun.  Something a little  different for you today.  I hope you enjoyed that.  Ah, yeah.  And, I don't know,  listeners are giving us  a lot of grief.  They're saying that we  promised Stalker Patty  the 50 bucks.  Anthony and I don't  really remember.  A lot of people  promising her money.  A lot of people  saying we even said  it on the air.  That, um,  that we would  pay her $50.  Now, I, uh,  I say they're  lying scumbags.  I don't remember this at all.  I didn't hear that.  I say you're lying scumbags.  You're lying. 
[02:21:00]  So, uh,  now Patty really  needs some money.  Now she wants to  come back in and  kind of beg for the  money, Anthony.  The boys are  begging you.  Let me get the money.  Turns out that she  only has 30 bucks  spending money a week.  She uses half that  money to tool around  town in cabs.  And the other half  goes to her  strict riot.  Walk it off,  dick.  Yeah, die.  She's got to walk.  So, uh,  Patty, um,  was telling Rick  during the commercial  that she really  needs the money  really bad, 
[02:21:30]  but she doesn't  want to cause  any confrontations  between us  and the show.  Oh, is that it?  Mm-hmm.  So, uh,  why don't you  bring Patty in again?  Die, you twat.  Oh, my God.  Frenchie.  Frenchie, man.  You stupid sea  bear.  Suck it.  Frenchie, put down  the beer.  Relax, all right?  All right, no more  beer for me.  No more beer for you.  All right, hi.  What's in that  gingerbread house?  And he only had one beer.  Take that wig off, 
[02:22:00]  God damn it.  People are saying  it's really pathetic  when Frenchie's  goofing on you.  Uh, Patty.  Patty.  Yeah.  Now, if you don't  get this $50,  are you going to be  thrown out of your  place?  Not really, no.  That's old name.  That was an easy one.  Patty, how much  money do you have  on you right now?  Too much.  Shut up, Frenchie.  Maybe a few dollars, 
[02:22:30]  enough to take a train.  How much is a few  dollars?  About ten.  You have ten bucks  on you?  Yeah.  Right now in your  pocket?  Well, not in my pocket.  Where's this ten bucks?  Where is it?  Where's the ten bucks?  Patty, where do you  keep your money?  Well, I keep my money  in my wallet.  And you only have  wallet with my lucky  two dollar bill.  And you only have  ten dollars on you,  right?  That's Thomas Jefferson.  Well, that's all I have 
[02:23:00]  for the week.  Huh?  That's all I have  for the week.  Ten bucks for the week.  Right now you have  ten dollars on your  person.  No more, no less,  right?  There is exactly  two dollar bills  in my wallet  and there is  eight dollars  at home  on my bureau.  So you have  two bucks on you.  Right now, yeah.  And you wouldn't  be lying to us, right?  That's all the money  you have, right?  Right.  The eight dollars  is home.  Is that all the money  you have in the world?  Well, until I get  paid Thursday.  You don't have a bank  account or anything?  Patty, are you lying 
[02:23:30]  to us?  Are you lying to  Opie and Anthony  and the rest of the  gang on the Opie  and Anthony show?  You have two bucks  on you, right?  Well, in my wallet.  What do you mean  by in your wallet?  In my wallet,  I got two dollars.  You're not telling  the truth, are you,  Patty?  Are you lying?  No.  You were trying  to get more money  from us.  You're lying.  How much money  did Jim Norton  hand you  during the commercials?  I didn't even  look at it. 
[02:24:00]  I just put it away,  but he said  don't say anything.  Ah, Norton.  In fairness,  I don't think  she's lying.  Believe me,  I'd love to yell  at her.  Norton,  don't you bang  enough chicks  that you don't  need this.  But he said  don't say anything.  So you probably  collected about  Noah Norton.  He probably gave  you 20 to 25 bucks,  so you're getting  that,  and then you're  coming in here  begging Aunt Nye,  so you're going  to walk away  with a pretty penny  today because you  lied to us.  You don't have  two bucks on you.  Well, I had  two dollars  in my wallet.  What's the money 
[02:24:30]  that Norton  shoved in your  hand during  commercials because  he felt so guilty,  you pussy.  I know.  And most girls  don't say anything.  I didn't even look at it.  Oh, shut up.  I just put it away.  Die.  Most girls,  Norton gives money  to it,  they have to wipe  strudel icing off  their face first.  He told me  don't say anything,  but I didn't even  know what he gave me.  I didn't even look.  I will say she's  telling me,  look,  it's out of  money.  Look at you.  Put it in her hand  and just look at you.  Like grandma  would give you money.  Here, here you go. 
[02:25:00]  Here's your money.  You know what,  you're right.  Most women I hand  money to,  within six months,  have a T-cell count  dropped.  I'm dying of AIDS.  Oh.  Why don't you  suck his mule for it?  But I really did  have money.  You should be bad  at it.  You know,  before he did that,  I really did have money.  Why can you tell us  that you have  more than two bucks?  How much money  are you going to  try to get from us?  Yeah, really?  He told me  don't say anything.  How much did you  give her?  He told me not  to say anything.  How much?  Twenty-five.  Not a big deal. 
[02:25:30]  Twenty-five bucks.  I don't even know  what it was.  We got to,  didn't we?  Yeah.  I love it.  Jeez.  Well, I just put it  in my pocketbook,  but I didn't look at it.  I just,  it says,  well,  thank you.  Whatever.  So obviously  you don't need  Anthony and I  to pay you  any more money.  You got some  good money today,  right?  You did all right.  It's all right.  Now you put that up  with the eight  on your bureau.  Then you got  thirty-three bucks  for your future.  Did you say bureau?  Yeah,  that's how I say it. 
[02:26:00]  Bureau.  Isn't it a dresser?  Yes,  since 1908.  Yeah.  It's up on the bureau.  Well,  I still say on,  wah.  So,  you know.  What?  Just shut up.  Oh my God.  It's an old-fashioned word  for the word bureau.  Do you call a living room  a parlor?  Sometimes.  You go in the bureau.  Raised that way.  All the parents  that raised me.  Raised by Lizzie Borden. 
[02:26:30]  No.  Black and white pictures.  Well,  my foster parents  were the same age.  Oh my God.  Did she just say  foster parents?  No,  they were the same age.  Your life gets  more pathetic  the more we dig.  Your foster parents?  Why were you  given away  by your real parents?  Your foster parents  were in their 60s?  Yeah.  And how old were you?  I was like  11, 10.  And why were you  given away  by your real parents?  Well,  they couldn't  take care of me.  They took care of you  for 10 years  and saw their investment  go down the tubes. 
[02:27:00]  I was given up as a baby.  What?  I was given up as a baby.  You were given up  as a baby  by your real parents?  Nine months old.  And your real parents  gave you to these  other people  that raised you  until you were 10?  And then they said  screw this  and gave you  to someone else?  No,  I was just in  foster home.  That's all.  Oh,  you were in foster?  That's what I'm saying.  Your real parents  gave you away at nine.  At nine months.  All right,  and that's it?  All right,  and I'm out.  You win.  I can't do it.  Why?  You win.  People have problems 
[02:27:30]  and can't raise their kids.  Giving up already?  I'm out of this.  Do you have any clue  who your real parents are?  Well,  yeah,  I met them  when I was a child.  You did?  But they've died  since then.  They killed themselves.  Yeah,  probably so.  I don't know  what they died from.  I know my father  died of emphysema.  Emphysema?  No one died  of emphysema.  You're smoking.  Doing the smoking,  huh?  I guess so.  I don't know.  I don't remember too much.  Please,  emphysema,  take me.  You outlasted everyone.  Congratulations. 
[02:28:00]  I could go for an hour.  The foster parent thing.  All alone,  right,  Patty?  Home to home.  You know what the funniest thing is?  Foster parents are usually  the most loving,  will take them in.  They have a hard time  giving the kids up  because they grow  so attached to them.  Foster parents  are just tossing you away.  Get this mess out of you  with our hammer toes.  Yeah,  exactly.  Oh,  then you turn to religion  and that effed you up.  Ugh,  what a mess.  Find Satan.  Just find Satan. 
[02:28:30]  Make a deal.  Say,  look,  Satan,  give me ten good years.  You know?  Become a whore.  Make a deal  and then just,  you'll be committed  eternally to hell  but I don't see how that one's  much different than your life.  So,  Patty,  where do you go  on Christmas morning?  I have friends  I spend it with.  Do you go home?  Do you have friends  you spend Christmas with?  Every year.  Yeah,  the same people.  No foster parents  send you the cards?  Well,  no.  No?  Sorry,  I touched you cards.  Very funny. 
[02:29:00]  My friends are very good to me.  This is somebody  I used to work for  a long time.  Yeah.  The guy you brought  to the U2 show?  Oh, yeah,  my friend,  yeah.  He's a nice guy.  There you go.  I'm out of this, babe.  I can't do this.  Can't take it anymore?  No.  Yeah,  damn it.  All right,  we're going to make you  beg for the money  and stuff.  Oh,  look at George  is straightening things out.  He says,  Patty wasn't a foster child.  She was traded  for two cans of Foster.  That'd be funny.  Thank you,  George. 
[02:29:30]  That's cute.  Just straightening that out.  That's funny.  That's real cute.  Yeah,  bye.  All right.  Congratulations, Patty.  You made people feel  sorry for you  once again today.  Keep your streak alive.  They threw the baby away  like Batman 2  with the penguin.  Remember that one?  Well, she's got penguin feet,  so...  Yeah,  it might be.  She might be able  to do a trick with them,  huh?  Make some money.  All right, Patty,  we'll pay you.  We'll pay you.  All right,  we'll give you your money. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Give that to me.  Other people want to  want to give you money.  I don't know.  Maybe they can stop by  and we'll collect it  and Patty could  give a retarded telethon.  Patty could kind of,  you know,  take the money  and do what she needs  to do with it,  okay?  Blessed be Norton.  Shut up.  Oh, God,  it's something  I never wanted to hear.  Believe me,  he still chokes hookers.  I'm a dirtbag boy.  I have not changed.  All right.  Thank you, Patty.  You're welcome.  Yes, she gives. 
[02:30:30]  Well, Anthony,  let's not change the subject.  A couple things going on  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What happened?  She likes the house.  She's moving in  on the gingerbread house.  I like it.  I think it's cleverly.  I want to move in.  All right.  It's a virtual mansion.  Eat some of it.  All right,  a couple things going on  on the show.  Yeah.  Friday is the big day.  We're going to play  What the Hell is That?  What the Hell is That?  We have people  with these problems,  maybe growths,  just things. 
[02:31:00]  If you have something  that is on your body  or there's something  going on with you  and you don't know  what it is  or what it does,  give us a call.  We'll invite you down  Friday for the big party.  What the hell is that?  We need a couple doctors  to donate their time  and come down here Friday  to pretty much diagnose  these fine listeners of ours,  okay?  I think finally  we're going to have  someone diagnose  what Twato is.  Yeah,  on Sandy Kane,  that growth  that we've been  wondering about  for so long now,  a doctor's going to  finally get to the 
[02:31:30]  bottom of that.  Because it was all  fun and games,  but now Sandy Kane  is very mad at Aunt and I  because no one will touch her  because of the things  we have said about her Twato.  We say it's genital warts.  I still stand by that.  I will stand by that too  and we're going to get  a couple doctors down here  and they will tell us  what it is  and they'll tell you  what you got as well  if you got something,  okay?  Right.  So we still need a doctor.  Call in or email  oaproducer at yahoo.com  oaproducer at yahoo.com  okay?  And Mr. DVD,  by the way,  will not be on our show  anymore.  Yeah,  we got a little email 
[02:32:00]  from who?  His people?  Yeah.  We fooled him twice  and I guess he's on to us.  Yeah.  Well,  actually,  Ben,  get on mic  because I'm part of this one.  So after the second time  that we played the silent game  with Mr. DVD  like five times in a row,  Anthony,  and he hung in there?  Uh-huh.  For the record,  by the way,  the silent game record.  Oh,  yeah,  he called back  more times than anyone.  So Ben talks to me  and goes,  dude,  what do you want to do  with Mr. DVD,  man?  They're calling back again. 
[02:32:30]  I go,  oh,  make believe  we had a problem  with the phones  and we really want them on  and,  you know,  book it.  I was hoping for a third  appearance by Mr. DVD.  Unprecedented third appearance.  Right.  So what happened,  Ben?  They didn't buy it,  right?  Dude,  I wrote an email  just doing what you  had told me to do.  Yeah,  what was the email,  basically?  I was just like,  you've got to be joking me.  What kind of idiot  do you think I am?  I heard the whole bit.  You guys are on 15 markets.  How are we not going  to hear it?  I said,  all right,  you got me, 
[02:33:00]  type thing back  and then that's the response  to that.  I said,  yeah,  we were screwing around  but we still want to have him  back on.  This is from Mr. DVD's people.  Hi,  Ben.  Sorry for the delay.  I was busy shaking my head  and chuckling to myself  at your email  that you sent me.  Thanks for the kind  and gracious offer  of an encore performance.  Unfortunately,  at this juncture,  we must graciously  and with deep regret  decline your invitation  to be ridiculed yet again.  Then it turns out  the guy's going to be  on Letterman. 
[02:33:30]  Oh,  yeah?  He's going to be  on Letterman.  Wouldn't it be great  if Letterman just did  the silent game with him?  Like,  he comes out  and the guy sits there  and Letterman just  starts talking to  nobody,  actually.  It's just a silent game.  Or maybe Mr. DVD will cry  and Letterman will hold his hand.  Oh,  that would be good courage.  Yeah,  he's going to be  in New York City  in early 2002  for a Letterman visit.  Perhaps at that time  we can work out  an in-studio visit.  I will bring my hockey stick  for protection  and several Soprano-like  Mr. DVD fans.  Till then,  PH. 
[02:34:00]  Oh,  a Letterman visit.  It's probably like  Bill Letterman,  one of his friends.  So,  okay.  So,  yeah,  Friday we're playing  What the Hell is That?  We need some doctors  and we need you to call  if you've got something  you want the doctors  to examine.  Yeah.  And then we announced  it earlier today.  We're very excited  to announce  that a week from tomorrow  homeless,  the homeless shopping spree  returns.  Yeah.  For just in time  for Christmas.  We're helping the homeless.  That's right.  It's going to be great.  We gather up  some of the most  smelly, stinky,  degenerate homeless, 
[02:34:30]  put them on a bus  and send them  to a very plush,  very lovely mall  during the crowded  holiday season.  And we give them  some cash  and let them shop.  Right.  Let them try on clothing  with their urine-smelling bodies.  Let them try on shoes  with feet even more disgusting  than our own patties.  And they will go  to Victoria's Secret  and maybe buy  a lovely number  for their homeless partner.  Picture Ziggy.  Oh, my God.  Picture Ziggy  coming out of the dressing room  wearing one of those  underwear that has 
[02:35:00]  the elephant trunk  and ears sticking  out of the front  and nothing but feces  smeared on the back of it  when he gives it back.  The stores just love  when we do this.  This was a huge success  the last time we did it  two years ago.  We had a blow-off last year  because it was so intense  the first time we did this,  but we're bringing it back  and we're not announcing  the mall.  Yeah.  So it'll be a big surprise  to everyone  which mall we pick  this year.  Homeless shopping spree,  two coming a week  from tomorrow.  Smell it now.  Did I ever... 
[02:35:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Jim.  I don't know if I ever  told you this.  Real quick story.  I was coming home  from acting class  and I'm looking  at a doorway  and I see a homeless girl  passed out.  Did I tell you that?  With her pants pulled down  and a homeless guy  taking advantage  of the fact  that she was passed out.  Wow.  And his face was...  Really?  I swear to God.  And this is as truthful  as I can be with you.  Wow.  A giver.  I stopped  and I caught myself  pinching my helmet  and I'm like,  you have to get help.  You thought that was hot.  It was just so...  Well, the chief...  It was so wrong. 
[02:36:00]  It was so dirty.  It was so dirty.  Dirty.  Just so dirty.  He probably wasn't  even thinking of it sexually.  He probably just wanted  a meal.  Hot meal.  So we promised  the homeless people  are going to be  way over the top  this year.  A week from tomorrow.  Homeless shopping spree,  too.  Okay?  That is a sick story.  No, it's true.  Face right between the cheeks.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, hey.  Dude, my image  of Norton  is completely blown.  He's not the tin man 
[02:36:30]  the guy's got a heart.  I knew when he came  back in the studio  that he snuck  Patty some money.  Oh, he could bust  balls forever  for the rest of his life  and nobody will  ever believe him.  The dude is just like,  he's got a heart, man.  He blew it.  All right.  Guys, be good.  Thank you, Craig.  Chuck.  Well, we're going  to take a break  and I guess  when we come back  we'll play  What Did We Learn  on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right?  All right.  O.P. and Anthony.  I can't stumble.  We can't let these people  reproduce.  How does he know class? 
[02:37:00]  In the toilet.  I'll never work  in the town again.  Disgusting.  How do they let this  on the air?  We suck.  Everyone hates us.  Child.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ah, you're checking out  the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We had a lot of fun today.  Hey, some of our pals  have been hanging  outside the studio  for over an hour.  Hour and a half.  What's that?  I believe we got  some firemen  and some cops. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Let me grab a mic  for you there.  There you go.  What's happening?  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  Do you guys  want to plug something?  Yes, because you weren't  knowing.  Sorry to make your way, bro.  No, that's cool.  Here, you want this?  Here.  Another great cause, Anthony.  Yes.  Yeah, the New York State  and the New York State  police department.  Hey, dude, dude.  You got to plug it  to the mic.  Yeah, and take the chair  out of your mouth  and we'll be good.  Hey, you just got  to pull that mic up 
[02:38:00]  by your mouth.  Yeah, so people  can understand  what you're saying.  Sorry.  There you go.  Yeah, the New York State  police department  and the fire department  were going to have  a benefit lacrosse game.  It's right before  the Saints on Saturday,  November 8th.  It starts at 5.30.  November?  December 8th.  December 8th.  This Saturday.  This Saturday coming up.  Lacrosse, huh?  Yeah, they do the indoor  cops and firemen  playing lacrosse.  Well, they're doing  the indoor lacrosse game  at the Coliseum  and you guys are going  to do a game  before the actual game, right?  Yeah, right before  the Saints game.  We're going to start  at 5.30.  Their game's going  to start at 7.30. 
[02:38:30]  You get two games  for the price of one ticket.  It's easy.  If you want tickets,  you just got to call  up the Saints  which is 631-567-9114.  Tickets are $20  to $14.50.  Okay.  It's going to be sick.  Party afterwards  and have a good time.  Very cool.  And the money's going  to half of the ticket sales  for each ticket sold.  $8 is going to go  to the Widows  and Children's Fund  and the Police  and Fire Department.  Great cause, obviously.  So, it's this Saturday.  They're playing lacrosse 
[02:39:00]  at the Coliseum  before the Saints game,  all right?  Call the Saints  and take a box office  for more details.  Who do you think  of winning, though?  Firemen or other cops?  Oh, man.  I ain't going there.  I was hoping  he would just say  who it was  so you could put  all your money  on the other guys.  We won this summer.  The Police Department  beat them this summer.  We beat them.  Yeah?  All right.  10-4, 10-5.  What was it?  10-5?  Nah, I think we won  by two.  10-8.  That's a tough game.  That's crazy.  I like watching that.  Crazy bastards.  I love indoor lacrosse.  And we're actually  playing the indoor way, 
[02:39:30]  too, the Police Department  and Fire Department.  We're playing  with the 4x4s.  Right.  So, it's going to be...  Actual 4x4 posts  that you'll hit each other with?  Is that it?  Is that...  No 6x6 nets now.  It's going to be  all the small nets.  Cold nets, small nets.  Check it out.  Sounds like a good time.  All right, Anthony,  time to play  What Did We Learn  on the Opie and Anthony Show?  Very educational,  believe it or not.  It certainly was.  I'm going to go  right to earn  right off the bat here.  Aaron,  what did you learn  on the show today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned that foster kids

Today I learned  that Norton had  300 victims' names  in his Palm Pilot  before he dropped them.  Victims.  Jeff from Philly.  Patty should go on tour  with Voss.  This way people  could feel sorry  for both of them.  Voss for his horrible jokes  and Patty for her pathetic life.  You know,  more abuse about Voss 
[02:40:30]  comes from Philly  than any other city.  They love him.  They love him in Philly, man.

The year in sex  or something. 
[02:41:30]  They have the actual  WOW bumper sticker.  Yeah, it's cool, man.  I learned that  Earl took Norton's advice  and drank a glass of AIDS.  Thank you, Bill.  Later.  All right.  No, Anthony from West Arms  said he learned  Earl's doing an impression  of a boy leaving  Norton's apartment  bleeding from the can.  Oh, my God.  Craig, you're next  on the O.P. to Anthony show.

Hey, how are you?  Hey.  I learned the words  to the Chop Suey song,  finally.  You know,  when Richard Cheese  and the gang  were playing that,  I'm like,  oh, that's the word.  That's it.  Oh, wow.  I'm not the only loser  that doesn't know  the words that way.  That's excellent.  Yeah, cool.  All right, thanks.  I hope you enjoyed  Richard Cheese  and Lounge Against the Machine. 
[02:43:00]  I enjoyed the month.  I'm considering  going to Mercury Lounge tomorrow.  Oh, there you go.  And I believe  they have a CD out.  It's pretty cool, too.  All right, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Uncle John,  one of our regulars.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned a whole bunch  of things today.  Yeah.  I learned we shouldn't  hurt innocent helicopters.  That's right.  Ozzy's.  I learned if they run  their VC,  if they stand still,  they're a well-disciplined VC.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Did I blow that joke  or what?  Yeah, really.  I suck.  That was the only line  I had in the whole bit.  I blew it. 
[02:43:30]  How do you lead them?  That's the worst.  How do you lead them?  Oh, no.  And I do,  since I said it,  I start sweating  like you do  when you say something stupid.  I'm like,  oh, no.  And cover my ass.  Oh, no.  What happens  if two guys own a bar  of their shoes?  I know.  What an idiot.  Go ahead, Uncle John.  Okay.  I learned if a woman  is smoking,  you should put her out.  Yeah.  I learned Norton  doesn't like the longer schlong.  And the last thing  is blind Dave fought.  He had a colonoscopy.  Yeah.  Oh, very good. 
[02:44:00]  Later, guys.  Thank you, John.  Gary said he learned  that sometime in January,  Rocco's going to have  a houseless spending spree.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, boy?  All right.  Today, I learned  that it takes $102  of Listerine  to get a good buzz.  Yes, we did learn that.  Norton?  Yes, sir.  You stink.  Hey, Paul,  you're next.  What's up?  That's great.  What's going on, dude?  Hey.  I learned that  Stalker Perry's parents  are older than 
[02:44:30]  Rich Voss's material.  And that the original joke  was,  do you want to buy  an arm or a dollar?  Very good.  Thank you, Paul.

Actually learned something.  Jeff, what's up?  Yo, boys.  What up?  Hey.  I learned that  if she blinks twice,  then it is okay.  Rape, that is.  And ping pong sound  always funny.  Ah, yeah.  We like bringing that  back every so often.  Later, I got to go  listen to myself.  Bye.  Cool.  I learned Norton  will give cash 
[02:45:30]  to anyone who  wets themselves.  Good callback.  That's very good.  That's Chris Crotch  from Philly.  Chris Crotch.  Wow.  Here's one.  Where's Frenchy?  Is he drunk somewhere?  Yeah, thank God  he's playing.  Paul from South Jersey,  I learned on O&A today  Frenchy is a one-beer queer  and needs to shut the F up  and that Norton  actually has a heart.  I learned Norton  will be riding around  in school buses  in Gary's school district.  That's Ron from Jersey.  Nice.  There's just so many. 
[02:46:00]  I think we got to go.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I learned that Tom Brokaw  is a 61-year-old Marine.  Semper fly.  I learned that  Storker Patty  is now on welfare.  And Norton,  you sick bastard,  you'd be honored  to go and train  Remshore's...  Rem...  Remfeld's...  Rem...  Remshel.  Remfeld, Remfeld.  You know what I meant.  Train his mule.  All right.  Good job.  Renfield,  Dracula's assistant. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, I learned  Patty's toes  look like Nosferatu's hands.  Did anyone get that one?  Uh, Anthony from West Orange.  I learned no good homeless people  will be going this year.  That is true.  They are going to be messes.  They're just going to be...  Awful.  And I can't wait  because no one's  in our way this time.  All right.  What do we got to give away?  A couple pairs of Aussie.  Nice.  Aussie tickets.  Uh, where?  Nassau Coliseum.  So, like,  the gang in Philly  could possibly win this, too.  We got two pairs of tickets 
[02:47:00]  to the Merry Mayhem Tour  featuring Aussie,  Rob Zombie,  and Mudvane  at the Nassau Coliseum  on Friday,  December 21st.  Tickets available  through Ticketmaster Outlets  and the Coliseum box office.  We got a couple pairs  right now  for a couple random callers,  okay?  And I want to say  no helicopters  are going to be hurt  at this event.  Not one helicopter.  And with that,  we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper, 
[02:47:30]  they would have wiped  their asses  with the tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
