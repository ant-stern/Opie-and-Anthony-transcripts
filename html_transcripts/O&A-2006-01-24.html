<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show began with a chaotic, obscenity-laden argument between Opie and Anthony, punctuated by repetitive phrases like "I bring nothing to the table" and "shut up."  Anthony then introduced the show, mentioning a jingle containing the phrase "suck my fucking cock."  The show featured listener calls, including one from Nova Scotia (which prompted geographically inaccurate banter) and another from Dan in Cleveland, who recounted a hilarious incident involving Patrice O'Neal’s *WebJunk 20*, John Daker videos, a laxative, and an unfortunate soiling of his pants.  This led to a discussion about ruined couches, particularly those destroyed by children.  A subsequent caller praised Patrice O’Neal's contributions, prompting speculation about O'Neal, Jimmy Norton, and Bill Burr potentially taking over the show, leaving Opie and Anthony to simply receive paychecks.  Plans were made to play clips from *WebJunk 20*, including a slowed-down video of President Bush designed to make him appear intoxicated.

Patrice O'Neal then shared anecdotes from his acting career, describing his experiences with actors like Edward Norton, Meg Ryan, and Barry Pepper, highlighting their contrasting personalities.  A caller mentioned positive feedback from *Truckin' Bozo*, a trucker radio show.  Further discussion involved O’Neal’s run-ins with *WebJunk 20* censors, including the rejection of a clip featuring *The Passion of the Christ* with Benny Hill music.  A caller inquired about O’Neal’s ability to promote the show elsewhere, which inexplicably led to a heated argument between Anthony and O’Neal concerning the geographical location of New Zealand, Google Earth, and flight paths, resulting in a frustrated caller from New Zealand hanging up.

Anthony then shared a deeply personal account of his recent divorce, detailing negative experiences with his ex-wife, her lawyer Dominic Barber, and the disappearance of $40,000 from a joint account.  He went into significant detail about the divorce proceedings, including the grounds for divorce and financial settlements.  Numerous callers shared their own divorce experiences, often using vulgar language and describing strategies, some of which were illegal, to navigate financial burdens.  The discussion included misogynistic and offensive language toward women.  One caller relayed a story where a friend’s unfaithful ex-wife was awarded his house, only to lose it due to financial difficulties.  Anthony described breaking into his own house to retrieve his belongings after a separation.

The conversation shifted to the hosts' long-standing feud with Howard Stern, referencing an old newspaper article detailing Stern’s threat to reveal details about Anthony’s divorce if the hosts didn't stop mentioning him.  The segment extensively covered past incidents in their rivalry, including on-air pranks, suspensions, and accusations of sabotage.  Kumia, the hosts' brother, was highlighted as a key figure in several pranks played on Stern, including successful entries in a Stern-hosted song parody contest.  The hosts also discussed their move to satellite radio, contrasting their experiences with Stern and other radio personalities.  Patrice O'Neal remained present in studio throughout this segment.

A subsequent segment focused on anonymous accounts of negative experiences with a radio host, referred to only as "Roth," detailing unprofessional behavior such as demanding renovations and then refusing to use the studio, conflicts with management, and erratic behavior.  The nonsensical phrase "Bozy bozy bop city bop" was frequently repeated.  This transitioned into recollections of their own past experiences with Howard Stern and his management, including threats of violence and restrictions on mentioning Stern’s name on air, using "radio edit" as a euphemism. A David Lee Roth parody song was played.  A significant portion recounted outrageous and sexually explicit stunts from their previous radio show, including a woman shooting eggs from her vagina, a blind man attempting to catch them, a cell phone being inserted into a vagina to check signal strength, and various stunts involving bottle rockets, cherry darts, and bodily fluids.  Listeners called in to share their memories of these events.  Bill Burr and Patrice O’Neal, both in-studio guests, contributed anecdotes and commentary.  The discussion included criticism of VH1’s *Flavor of Love*, observations about stand-up comedy at colleges, anecdotes about midgets, an audio clip from a tech podcast, and critiques of Linda McCartney and Yoko Ono’s singing abilities.  A listener recounted a story about Linda McCartney firing a truck driver for having a McDonald's bag in his truck.

The final segment centered on the song "She Let Herself Go," initially misconstrued as a commentary on weight gain after a breakup, but later revealed to have an empowering message.  The hosts discussed the song's ironic meaning, contrasting their initial interpretation with the actual lyrics. A listener, "80 inch," submitted a crude and misogynistic version.  The conversation touched on the reluctance of friends to offer honest pre-marriage advice, the awkwardness of witnessing someone's decline, and listeners' experiences with similar situations. The discussion then shifted to Paul McCartney and Heather Mills, with crude jokes about their relationship and drug use. A caller, Ken from Jersey, and another caller corroborated the hosts’ points about pre-marriage advice and ultimatums regarding drug use.  The segment concluded with a fundraiser for a regular show participant, "Patty," facing financial hardship.  Listeners raised $2000 for her rent, but the hosts orchestrated a humiliating stunt involving a blindfolded Patty finding the money amidst mousetraps, with the hosts and interns testing the traps beforehand.  Patty participated naked and blindfolded. The hosts made numerous crude and sexually suggestive comments throughout the stunt.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I bring nothing to the table.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:05:00]  I bring nothing to the table.  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, man.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Please, just shut up.  You're good.  You dick. 
[00:05:30]  I mean...  You dick.  For many days I didn't bring them here because I suffer when he bite me.  Well, I'm in my vagina.  Oh, those guys are fast.  You need to shut the fuck up.  My vagina.  And welcome to the Opiate Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:06:00]  Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  Can you turn down the rage for one second?  Cool.  O.B.  Anthony.  And Norton, too.  Good times.  Great hits.  XM 202.  Sucked by Huckin' Cork.  Still love that one. 
[00:06:30]  Still the best jingle we ever got in right there.  I thought you liked Greg and Tony's show.  No, Greg and Tony's show is good.  Believe me.  See, I like that on a creepy level.  But the other one has all the jingle rules and that surprise is suck my fucking cock ending.  And it's still an open-ended bid.  I mean, if you want to send in a jingle. 
[00:07:00]  Let's go for it.  No one's going to beat this one, though.  O.B.  Energetic.  Anthony.  And Norton, too.  Good times.  Great hits.  XM 202.  Suck my fucking cock.  Yeah, that's a great one.  You want to take a call from Nova Scotia right off the bat?  Nova Scotia?  Where is that?  Off the coast of Canada. 
[00:07:30]  It's way up there.  Yes.  Little island.  It's like north of Maine, I think.  Yeah, it's like north of Maine.  Yeah, you can fucking actually take a rowboat to fucking Nova Scotia.  If you wanted, I guess.  I didn't have that.  If you was fucking retarded enough.  Is that a suggestion?  I don't feel like being a Viking today.  I only know that because when you fly in the little GP, what is it, the fucking computer  right, the navigation system on the plane that they show you on television, you fly up  to Nova Scotia for some goofy reason and then you take a right. 
[00:08:00]  And then you turn?  Yeah, then you take a right turn going to England.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's some kind of probably tracking or air traffic control up there.  They want to make sure everything's cool before they go over that water for six straight  hours.  When there's no chance of landing in anything safe.  It's like, let's test out the instruments.  We've got a little land below us.  What a set of balls, man.  All right, I guess we're ready to go.  And then you take the shock right and you're off and running.  There goes the last airstrip, Nova Scotia.  Let's, well, buckle in because, I don't know, there ain't nowhere to land after this. 
[00:08:30]  Fuck, I don't know.  Let's say hi to Ian.  All the way up there in Nova Scotia.  What's up, Ian?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Brr.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Oof.  That's not nice, sir.  I didn't think there were races in Nova Scotia.  I didn't either.  You're not really from Nova Scotia, are you?  Yeah, we just like to have a little fun.  I'm just kidding.  I love your...  Oh, yeah, now he's from really...  He's from Nova Scotia.  Yeah.  You fucking apologetic.  I'm just having a little fun.  Joe, I love you. 
[00:09:00]  Didn't mean nothing.  He'll buy it or nothing.  Professor Anthony, I was just wondering if you might know the name of our new prime minister  last night.  You have a new prime minister?  Yeah, I'm just curious whether you're up on that kind of stuff.  Oh, yeah, because I saw some of their...  We've been following our elections, so I was wondering if you know ours.  I saw some of their campaign ads, and they're really different from American campaign ads.  Not as much, really, mudslinging and stuff.  But even in Canada, they use George Bush as the bad guy in their ads. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Like, one of the candidates was like, hey, this guy's friendly with George Bush, eh?  You sure don't want him to be the prime minister or nothing, eh?  What a slow motion handshake.  Yeah.  With Joe...  And it's all zoomed in and grainy and black and white.  And his face is twisting.  Yeah, dude, I don't remember their names, but I knew you had an election and everything.  How'd that go?  We got a new one.  After 13 years, we got a new one. 
[00:10:00]  Stephen Harper.  Stephen Harper is the guy now.  The next four years?  Yeah.  And he's the guy for four years, and we care why.  There are neighbors to the north.  We don't know shit about Canada.  It's the whole country.  Nobody in the Atlantic province has voted for this guy.  We're always liberal down in this part of the country, but our vote don't matter because  we're in office.  Let's do a quick round the table here and tell Canada, because we're on XM Canada now.  Yeah.  What we know about Canada. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  I know Rush and Neil Young came from Canada.  I know they like mayonnaise on their French fries.  And vinegar.  Vinegar.  They do a little vinegar action on their French fries.  And they have a coin called the Looney.  Ah!  And the Toonie.  Don't forget the Toonie.  And the Toonie.  I know the dollar one, yes.  I know that Vancouver is on the next disastrous fault line, that when that ruptures, there's  going to be a tsunami of devastating proportion on that region. 
[00:11:00]  You guys haven't touched on the fact that Howard isn't allowed in Canada.  They spent all that money for him, and they'll let him in Canada.  We've already went down that road, but we know that.  Yes.  We know Canada is a lot of Canada, and northern Canada, very barren.  Not many people up there.  Jim Carrey from Canada.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's all I know.  Second city, most of those guys.  You guys are like the North Pole South.  And if you don't fucking behave yourself, we'll make you a 51st state.  Yeah, yeah.  I wish.  And you're pretty much at our mercy. 
[00:11:30]  I wish.  Oh, fucking temp top.  All right, Ian.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Love that free health care.  Yes.  Let's go to Dan in Cleveland.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I didn't get a chance to call in yesterday.  I had my own little revelation watching WebJunk 20 I wanted to share.  Patrice O'Neill's new show on VH1.  Blowing up.  I think he's got a hit.  Knock wood.  Knock wood.  Absolutely.  I was sitting on the couch there just about to go to sleep, so three things you should  never combine is Patrice O'Neill, the John Dacre video, and Oxy Powder while you're sitting 
[00:12:00]  on your couch there.  Did you shit yourself, sir?  Holy shit.  The face that Patrice makes, imitating John Dacre, holy crack, I pooped right in my drawers.  John Dacre just singing awful versions of these classic tunes, I guess.  He's going to read this.  Absolutely.  And he started singing pizza pie, too.  That's Amore.  Holy shit. 
[00:12:30]  So now I'd like to add to Ant's booger couch.  I have a shit couch I need to get rid of.  Dude, you've got to throw away shit couch.  I don't care who you are.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't care how free with yourself or your germs or your bodily fluids you are.  You shit on your couch, that couch has to be out on the curb that night.  None of it's leather.  Leather will squeegee off.  Just wipe it off, man.  There's no pores.  No, we got two little ones, sir.  It's the Sam's Club special with all the funky decorations. 
[00:13:00]  You ever notice that?  I didn't know this because I'm not a parent, but what parents do when they have kids,  they forfeit any right to a nice place.  Like, you don't buy furniture you would want.  You buy this crappy furniture that can have crayons on it and be cut up and snotted on  and shit on and pissed on.  And that's how you live until your kid is old enough to leave the fucking house.  That's a great sacrifice, isn't it?  But when you get leather, it maintains more than the cloth. 
[00:13:30]  It's skin.  How do you get pen and magic marker off a leather?  Buy a black one.  I don't think that works with children.  They will fuck it up.  Do you know what's on my leather couch?  Oh, I can only imagine.  Oh, can I only imagine.  They could clone Patrice's into the fucking 31st century.  You wouldn't know unless you had one of those blue lights.  And the whole couch is white once you turn it off. 
[00:14:00]  It's not one spot.  The whole couch is white.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What the?  Let's go right to Ed in Chicago.  It's crackly, too.  It's crackly.  Ed, what's up?  It's flicking off.  Ed.  White cornflakes.  Ed.  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey, Ed.  I just want to say, Patrice, you're awesome, man.  You make me want to not turn off my radio.  I think you're the...  Jimmy's great, but I think Patrice is awesome in this radio.  Well, here's the deal.  Jimmy comes back on Monday, and we can't let Patrice O'Neal just go away. 
[00:14:30]  So he'll be...  He'll still be on the show.  I'll still be in New York.  Yeah, he'll still be on the show.  Call me up.  As long as you're in New York, man.  Patrice is in New York.  Make sure Patrice doesn't have an outside.  I just wanted to say, man, thank you, Patrice, for some of the best radio, man.  Yeah, Patrice has killed the last couple of weeks, especially.  Yeah, this is just going to bite us in the ass eventually.  It's going to be...  We're going to get to the point where it's Jimmy and Patrice and Bill Burr,  and they're going to tell us what days we should come in.  OB, you come in Thursday at 9. 
[00:15:00]  As I go, hold on a second, fellas.  Hey, OB, let me just sit over there and see how you're doing.  Yeah, let me check your seat out.  I'll be sitting outside the studio looking at my watch.  When the fuck do I get to come in?  It's 9.30.  Whisper it easy and going, you know, you treat your life.  Let me tell you something.  It's a sergeant in his back.  That's our ultimate goal, by the way.  That's our ultimate goal, to franchise the name of the show out  and just sit at home and collect the paychecks.  Ain't even us anymore.  If you guys want to do the show and it's still called OB and Anthony, 
[00:15:30]  I don't give a shit.  The OB and Anthony show starring Bill Burr and Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  As long as the name's there and they don't get it wrong on the paychecks they send out,  I don't care who does the show, quite frankly.  Hey, speaking of WebJunk 20 on VH1 with Patrice O'Neill, there's two clips I want.  I want to get the John Decker or...  John Daker.  Daker.  Hilarious.  I want to get the John Daker clip.  And also, it's a brilliant clip of President Bush.  We need to play that today as well.  Which one?  Can we get the whole clip?  Is that the slow motion drunk one? 
[00:16:00]  Holy crap, what a great observation.  WebJunk 20 pointed out, I guess it was a Craig Ferguson clip or something from one of his shows.  And they slow down President Bush's speech to make him sound drunk.  It's really, really funny.  And he looks and sounds drunk.  It's slowed down to the perfect level of drunkenness.  Yes.  Where he's talking and you're like, oh my God, he's drunk.  When that show came on, I thought, I'm like, okay, you know, of course.  I'm like, okay, but you can't believe how many people haven't seen this shit.  And doing this show, it's all on it. 
[00:16:30]  And you just figure it's just out there like that.  You've got to give yourself a little credit, too.  Because you can watch this shit online and it's great and stuff.  But like that guy said, sometimes just they pop in with one of your fucking facial expressions and it kills me.  You're either just completely disgusted with something or surprised or dismayed.  The gamut of emotions on Internet's videos.  Well, I love your delivery in general with the show. 
[00:17:00]  You're like, I can't believe I'm doing this shitty show.  I love that.  Like, one week you went, oh, lucky me.  I'm like, God damn it.  Finally gets like a huge hit on VH1.  He's like, I can't be bothered with this horseshit.  You can't understand.  Like, we were just talking before the show.  It's like, I parked the car and the dude's like, hey, oh, I know you.  And I'm like, okay, from what?  Yeah.  And he just, oh, the web thing, man.  The web junk.  And you just go, God, you know, I did a movie. 
[00:17:30]  I played a fag in a movie.  Big Ryan.  I played a transvestite, man.  Edward Norton.  Edward Norton.  Damn.  I was in a movie.  I had dialogue with Edward Norton in the movie.  It wasn't like it was just in the background.  I talked to Edward Norton.  You were talking with him.  I was fucking, and I'm not a Sklana Slavsky method, motherfucker.  I'm not.  I actually acted.  He has to, these, the whole cast of that movie was in character all the time.  Really?  Meg, every movie I did, everybody's an actor.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Like Meg Ryan, she, she walks around as the fucking person she's playing.  And I'm like, hey, how you doing?  The only person in any movie I ever did that who's not on like that sociopathic, don't talk  to me, I'm fucking in character, is Barry Pepper.  Barry Pepper.  Really?  Barry Pepper.  He's like, dude, what's happening?  I was like, hey man, congratulations on Battlefield Earth.  And he just fucking started laughing.  Oh, shit.  So he's like a real dude.  But you go, excuse me, Mr. Philip Seymour Hoffman?  I'm sorry, my name is Jack.  Please don't call me that.  It's like, motherfucker, are you in the, are you, are you okay? 
[00:18:30]  I'm acting.  Do I really believe him?  Well, I play basically me anyway.  But it's like Edward Norton, I'm laughing at him and stuff.  And Spike says, keep laughing at him.  But Edward goes, because he's an actor, he'll go.  So he said, listen, I think we did seven takes already of you laughing at me about going  to prison, I think maybe, maybe we should try another, just another way of doing it.  And then I did it his way and Spike came over and goes, the fuck you doing, man? 
[00:19:00]  I go, I didn't want to snitch on him.  I go, I just thought I'd try to do it.  And I'm protecting this fucking asshole.  So he goes, nah, just laugh.  So next take, it comes on.  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm going to jail for seven years.  I'm like, oh, shit, you going to jail?  Oh, my God.  And he just looks at me like this, you peasant motherfucker.  You extra.  Extra.  You extra.  How high is these fat extras?  Wow, that's cool, because Barry Pepper isn't like that.  And he's like a great actor. 
[00:19:30]  Barry Pepper, fucking guy, went, he just, cut, he's like, hey, how's everybody doing, baby?  What's going on?  Wow.  I said, I love you in Battlefield Earth.  He goes, start telling me stories about fucking the movie and how awful it was.  Yeah.  Just awful.  Horrible.  Horrible experience, and he was a cool motherfucker, but like Meg Ryan, I did in the cut, didn't  talk to her, pass, action.  Really?  Action.  Hi, how you doing?  I'm fine, fine, and I'm being a sissy.  Then it's like, cut, and I'm like, hey, Meg, and she's just like, huh, what did you just 
[00:20:00]  say to me?  The help is talking to me.  Get my assistant over here and get rid of the help.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, man.  Let's go to South Carolina.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, sirs, how y'all doing?  Pretty good.  Mike, a pest checking in, Anthony, has some info for us.  Yes, Mike?  Yeah, I called in on the Truckin' Bozo Friday night, just to give y'all a shameless plug,  and to my surprise, he ran it on y'all for about five minutes, some good phrases.  Oh, yeah?  He called it on the Bozo? 
[00:20:30]  What's that?  I've heard the Truckin' Bozo a few times.  Yeah, we like the Truckin' Bozo.  It does a great job for those truckers out there.  Yeah, that's why I told him, and then he went on and said it.  He said many times that even playing field, y'all would just totally destroy Howard Stern,  and he talked about how boring Howard was and how y'all were just the cutting edge, that  kind of thing.  Awesome, man.  Well, thank the Truckin' Bozo for us.  We sure will, and it was on at 645.  Y'all want to pull up the audio and listen to it? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, we'll try to find it.  All right, y'all be careful.  All right, thank you, Mike.  Let's go to Charlie in New Jersey.  Charlie, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, listen, Patrice, I would love it if you did Boo Got Shot on WebJunk 20.  I don't have any power with these clips.  I could suggest it.  You suggest it.  We'll write it down for you.  But I bet you Boo Got Shot is too, they're so, like they let me be a little edgy.  A little.  They let you curse?  They let me curse. 
[00:21:30]  A little.  You were talking about a clip on Dr. Phil where the lady was describing oral sex?  Yeah.  You saw that, right?  Actually, this week's show was really, really good.  I'll give you an example.  Can we get that clip too?  Damn it.  They was going to do a thing that I said no to.  Really?  It was a clip that I was like, look, I can't do.  It was Passion of the Christ with the Benny Hill music to it.  Sped up.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And it was just like, and it would like do the thing where it clawed his chest and pulled 
[00:22:00]  his meat out and the wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, wow.  And it hit him.  And I'm like, look, I'm not a motherfucker who's afraid of, like I said, but I don't know  how to make fun of Jesus with the Benny Hill music.  I can't do it.  That would probably cause some crap to him.  This would just be crazy.  And now, they was going to do that, and they said, okay, we're not going to do that.  They made a decision.  But they said, no, it's a clip of Hervé Villachez singing. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah, it's awful.  We have that clip.  And he's so awful.  From Dinah Shore.  We actually have that clip.  And they go, no, he's dead, and we can't.  And I'm like, what?  What?  Like, yeah, it was some sort of...  So is Jesus.  So Bougat's shot is like, I think it's too...  It's too over the top, yeah.  Even though I did Chocolate City yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They let me do Chocolate City.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But they didn't, you know.  Did they give you the whole, after he talked about Chocolate City when he said, do you know  how do you make chocolate? 
[00:23:00]  Of course not.  Like, they just go to the Chocolate City, and I have to make innuendo.  Yeah.  Like, oh, no, he didn't, you know, he didn't mean black.  He just, he meant real chocolate, because everybody looted, you know.  He wants real chocolate, and he, oh, they cut out the part where he wanted a hamburger  city, and, you know.  Where do we get the Passion of the Christ clip?  Because we'll throw it on our website.  Dude, it's like...  Do you know where it is?  It's on iFilm.  Oh, it is on iFilm?  All that shit's on iFilm, man. 
[00:23:30]  Eric, let's link that to opianthony.com, because now we've got to see the Benny Hill music  in the Passion of the Christ.  Oh, it's so, it's so wrong, but it's funny, but it's so wrong.  All right, let's just, yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Brooklyn.  Joe, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, I just want to know, like, Patrice, are you ever able to, like, throw a plug in  the way, like, Leno does and, like, Norton does on, like, Leno, like, ONA and XM,  or are they, like...  Oh, fucks no, dude.  This is...  Let him build a power base here first.  I have a...  I am...  I am...  I didn't know this caller was going to say this, by the way. 
[00:24:00]  It's cool.  I'm on...  I'm on...  Big ONA shirt on.  It's a...  It's a...  Wait, oh, on that level, see, I'm such a fucking idiot when it comes to this stuff.  On that level, I bet you I could wear a nice, you know...  Yeah, but that...  It wouldn't go with your nice hat that you like to wear, even though you don't like the  team.  You fucking sell out.  I could wear something nice, like, nobody knows.  I could do that.  I could do that.  You could name three players on the Atlanta Braves, but you love their fucking hat. 
[00:24:30]  I know there's a Puerto Rican and two Cubans.  Dominican.  I don't know.  I don't know the fucking, you know.  But there's real gold there.  Hey, where's New Zealand?  It's way over there, right?  New Zealand's by Australia.  This is from...  Is it up or down?  Down.  It's the down one?  No, it's across.  It's across?  Down.  No.  New Zealand's in the Southern Hemisphere.  Is it south of Australia?  If you fly to New Zealand, you fly west.  You must to get to New Zealand.  You don't fly any south.  You must go south. 
[00:25:00]  You absolutely fucking do not.  Hold the phone.  What do we ask Brian?  You absolutely fucking do not.  Hold on.  You leave from here to go to...  You leave from New York to go to New Zealand.  You fly across the United States.  Right.  Then you get off the fucking plane, and you fly over Hawaii towards Australia to get to  New Zealand.  Australia?  You do not...  Let me just answer.  I don't know the course heading.  I don't know about changing planes.  All I know is, New York is in the Northern Hemisphere. 
[00:25:30]  Okay.  We are in winter right now.  Fair enough.  New Zealand is in the Southern Hemisphere.  They're in Georgia.  They are in summer right now.  Under the equator, but you...  In order to get there in some way, shape, or form, you must go south.  No.  Yes.  Absolutely.  No.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We just did a little Google Earth on New Zealand.  I'm telling you.  Turn that around and show him Google Earth.  It is southeast of Australia. 
[00:26:00]  Now, do the track again that you did.  Yeah.  Do the track that you did and show Patrice.  That is absolutely south.  Oh, fuck it.  We're not talking...  Look at...  I know when you fly to Japan...  I don't know how Magellan would be.  Watch, watch, watch.  Here it is.  Look.  We're going north right now.  We're going northeast.  Northeast.  Northeast.  Northeast.  Northeast.  Northeast.  Northeast.  Northeast.  United States.  What the fuck is this?  What the hell did you do there, Iraq?  They're actually showing like...  We just crashed into the water.  Yeah.  You made the United States look like a tiny little island in the middle of nowhere. 
[00:26:30]  It's the map from NASA.  I know because of the curvature of the Earth, when you fly to Japan, you actually have to  go over Alaska.  What?  Okay.  Then that's fair enough.  But...  So you go north.  I'm not saying it's not planet.  What you're saying is not...  I'm saying to get there, you don't go south.  You go west.  You absolutely go southwest.  Dude.  You have to go south.  You have to go south eventually.  You just go west.  I get the west thing.  You...  When you go to Australia...  Did you ever see a globe? 
[00:27:00]  I've looked at one once or twice.  Let me tell you, when you go to Australia, you go nowhere near South America.  You don't go near that.  You don't go that way.  Yeah, because it's further west than South America.  We finally found something that Patrice isn't good at.  Geography.  Geography.  Wow.  You stink at geography.  Dude, you fly over Hawaii to get to...  You don't...  You may dip.  That's again, so they can tell you, all right, now you're turning.  Here we go.  That's the last airstrip.  Here we go.  Here it is.  Here's the map.  Here's the map, and here's how you get there.  Okay, that's America.  Here we go. 
[00:27:30]  Look.  We're going south.  We're going south.  That's west and south.  Look how far south.  Look how far south.  That is so south.  What is wrong with you?  Shit.  You don't fly.  That toilet flushes counterclockwise.  I'm going to say it.  It's not where it's supposed to be.  Let's go to Brian, who's calling from New Zealand.  Why don't we just ask Brian.  Brian, it's south from America.  Brian hung up.  And there he goes.  He's disgusted.  We didn't know where his stupid little country is.  Now everyone's calling up to tell us where it is.  You're Kiwi. 
[00:28:00]  Don't worry about it.  It's 80 in New Zealand today.  That's why they call it Down Under.  That's right.  Let's go to Ralph in Connecticut.  We're all over the place today.  Ralph, what's up?  Hey, I just called to thank Ant for helping me save my life.  I saved.  So did I hit the OnStar for you after an accident, sir?  Nope.  How did I save your life?  I got my divorce finalized on Thursdays.  I heard all your stories.  And none of them beat you being a radio rock star.  Right.  It closely emulated mine.  So I had to go.  Wow. 
[00:28:30]  You got out before it got hot and heavy?  About eight years of marriage.  Eight years.  Okay.  But how did Anthony help you?  He just pushed me over the edge and said, no, I can't do this no more.  So he would have stayed in that marriage probably, being miserable.  Are you a successful man as far as your business goes?  I do about 70 a year.  I'm a truck driver.  All right.  He's a truck driver.  So you never know.  Do you have any dreams or aspirations to be something else? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  But I got to work on paying off on my debt first that she made up for me.  Oh, great.  See, but then if he achieves this dream of his, he doesn't have that big money pit called a  wife to take all his money.  Well, congratulations, sir.  I got off a little better than you, though.  Yeah, you did.  But she's only getting 10% for one year and then I'm done.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Look at you.  God, you lucky bastard.  How did that happen? 
[00:29:30]  I don't know.  How did that happen?  I talked to her and I said, look, you got two choices.  Either I'll pay you alimony for one year or I'll pay all the money I was going to pay  into alimony to a lawyer and make sure you get nothing and I'll take all the household  goods.  Yeah, I love when you can make those threats.  Oh, is that a Connecticut threat?  Because that's not an L.A. or a New York threat.  A New York threat.  I don't know.  Well, the divorce is actually in Tennessee, so all my stuff's in storage down there.  I've got to get it back up to Connecticut, so.  I just found all my, because I'll be moving shortly, so I'm trying to get my shit in order. 
[00:30:00]  You know, I'm going through boxes of stuff and found my transcripts from the last day  of my divorce proceedings where they sit you both down after you've settled and everything  is like the court reporter takes every word down and I'm flipping through page after page  like it was yesterday and just reading what the settlement is and Dominic Barber's little  statements and, can we go off the record?  And then I remember like what he said off the record there and then he has this whole thing 
[00:30:30]  about where I can talk about certain aspects of the divorce if it's for the show because  they can't, you know, they can't rein me in, this is, part of the show is me talking  about my life.  Sure.  So they couldn't make a stipulation in there that I couldn't talk about the divorce, but  I can't talk meanly, I can't be mean about Dominic or my ex-wife or anything like that.  I could talk about my life, which included, you know, some things that weren't fun.  Who's Dominic?  Dominic Barber. 
[00:31:00]  A stupid fat fuck attorney.  One of Howie's best friends.  You want to sue me for calling you a fat fuck?  I'd let any jury try that case.  They'd look at you and say, well, he is a fat fuck.  Son of a bitch.  Unless he lost a lot of weight in the last month.  Yeah.  Last time we saw him, he was still a fat fuck.  So you don't like him because he lost some money for you?  The guy was my wife's lawyer.  He was my ex-wife's lawyer.  Oh my God.  And I had the lawyer that the Benny Hill music should have been playing with. 
[00:31:30]  They came in.  I swear to God.  Dominic.  You know, for as much of an asshole as he is, he is the perfect divorce lawyer.  If you're getting divorced.  Jesus, don't give the guy a free commercial.  I'm going to endorse the guy because he is the biggest prick when it comes to divorce.  And I had a guy who'd come in with like, he reminded me of me in high school.  Coming into class with a sheet of paper and not a pencil and asking, do you got them? 
[00:32:00]  And meanwhile, Dominic is wheeling in hand trucks with boxes of paperwork that I paid every penny for.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, if we look back at the year 1973, that's when you started your joking.  It was only enhanced when you met your wife and she...  Are you still paying her out?  Of course. 
[00:32:30]  Until when?  I was married nine years.  I'll be paying nine years.  How long ago was this?  2000.  So I'll be paying until 2009.  Oh, you're almost there.  It's getting close, dude.  It's getting close.  The year goes by and I go, another year.  Tick, tock, tick, tock.  If she gets married, though, you don't have to pay anymore, right?  Oh, that?  No, I do.  Even if she gets married?  Even if she gets married.  Dude, I had to fight to get this out of there.  They wanted to write into the deal that if she died, I still had to pay her heirs and 
[00:33:00]  her estate.  And if she had kids, I had to pay the children.  If she died, I got that taken out.  I don't know how.  In what state?  New York?  New York.  Because you know why?  It's a settlement.  You can make up whatever rules you want.  If I sign it, that's how it goes.  And it reached the point where this was going on for three years.  I'm paying legal fees, so I'm pumping money into Dominic Barber's pocket.  Where is she getting money? 
[00:33:30]  From me!  To pay for the fucking divorce?  The whole time, I'm paying what is called support.  So during the whole thing, before you're even divorced, I have to keep paying.  Pay and pay, pay.  Pay her lawyer bill.  Pay, pay, pay, pay, pay.  When it's over, I've got to pay.  Pay, pay, pay, pay.  Nine years.  And she wiped out the joint account.  Oh, and then I go to take out half of our joint account.  I had $40,000 in my account.  All I ever had, everything I worked for up to that point in my entire life, 40 large. 
[00:34:00]  I go to Fleet Bank in Manhattan where I was.  Yeah, and I went.  Me and Ope, I go, you know something?  It was actually my idea.  I go, and things are getting a little ugly.  I would go down to the bank and see what you could take out of your joint account.  And I swear to you, and I say this every time we bring this up, this guy is a nice guy.  He goes, you know what?  I'll go down and I'll take half.  It's a joint account.  I go, I'm going to take $20,000 out.  I'll take my half out and leave the other half for her.  I go down there.  I write out a big withdrawal slip for $20,000.  Go up to there.  I go, give me $20,000.  They're like, could you talk to this gentleman over here? 
[00:34:30]  I talk to him.  She took the fucking money.  He goes, sir, there's about $86 in that account.  It's like, oh my God, 40 large.  And never got the money back.  Never got that back.  Never got that back.  Never got that back.  And get this.  What was the grounds for the divorce?  What was...  Get this.  She took the $40,000.  And above and beyond that, even though I went into court and said, Your Honor, she took $40,000.  She should be able to live on that for a while.  Day one, I had to still start paying her. 
[00:35:00]  So she took everything I had and I still had to pay every month.  Could you believe it?  How can you look another bitch in the face?  It's divorce.  No, it's not how can you look another bitch in the face.  How could you look another bitch in the face and go, I do?  That will never happen.  Now, are you at the...  Your girl's cool.  I know your girl.  There's no common law shit.  Is she on some shit to get off the park thing?  Is she feeling it?  She don't want to get married either.  That'll change eventually.  How long have y'all been to get?  Like five years? 
[00:35:30]  Seven.  Seven?  Seven?  And it's not even...  She doesn't blink slow at all?  Nope.  She knows she's taken care of.  She would be taken care of.  Yeah, that's a fucking famous last word.  She knows.  She knows?  Holy shit.  He got killed.  What was the grounds?  Did bitch cheat on you or anything?  Dude, grounds.  Well...  Irreconcilable horseshit?  In New York, there's only three grounds for divorce.  You can't get to...  It's holding back sex for a year.  That's one ground. 
[00:36:00]  The other ground is cruel and unusual punishment.  Which is redundant.  Which is holding back sex.  And the third one is adultery.  Yeah, I gotta say...  Things were shaky for a few years before I left the house.  Now, who was holding back sex?  You or her?  Well, it was...  Mutual.  Well, see, I'm the worst person at cheating. 
[00:36:30]  I've brought this up.  I'm really bad at cheating.  Right.  Because I bring my girlfriend's home with the wife there.  Like, I don't care.  When I find somebody that I'm really into, I'll just bring them home.  Hey, baby, this is my girlfriend.  See, you left that part of it, so you used to bring them back home.  No wonder she took on you, but she...  My wife, this is my girlfriend, and I guess we're through. 
[00:37:00]  It's...  But, you know, regardless...  Jesus, I was feeling all bad.  I was on a campaign and just, you know...  Dude, I was in nine years of shit.  You should feel bad for this man.  It was just the worst.  Was she hot?  Let me tell you something, you son of a motherfucking bitch.  She was a drunk.  I can't...  I will not...  Let's just say.  Let's just put it in these terms.  There were days where everything was fine, and when we would go out to the bar, I would 
[00:37:30]  have the pre-bar speech, which would be like, hey, could we just keep cool tonight?  Let's have a good time.  Do some shots if we want, but please, any time we get into these drunk arguments, they're  always about nothing, so let's just not get into them.  So, he was the reverse Eric Clapton song. 
[00:38:00]  She would have to sing, he puts on his makeup, brushes and plucks his pretty eyes, then he  asks me.  But then, by 11 or midnight, what the fuck do you think?  And I try to rationalize.  I'll be like, you know, listen, we've been, and by we've, I mean you, we've had a few  tonight, we're drinking, it's just like I said earlier, this would happen, so could we 
[00:38:30]  just, this argument is about nothing, so let's just have a good time, you know, you fucking  have a good time, and I'll do what the fuck I want, because you're, it's trying, it was  me thinking I could rationalize with somebody that wasn't in any condition to be rationalized  with, but you honestly think when you're leaving to go to the bar, and she's going, yeah, no,  no, no, baby, no problem, man, it's not going to happen. 
[00:39:00]  Woosh, Jack, woosh, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.  And what was, what was you wooshing down?  Was you wooshing down anything?  Yeah, Jack Beers.  I'm a great drunk, Patrice.  I can drink like a motherfucker, and the cops won't know it.  I swear to you, I am one of the best drunks you will ever see.  I can be drunk right now.  So why not a movie or theater or something?  You think I like club soda?  This is vodka.  Every day, I drink a bottle of vodka on the show.  No, I'm a great drinker. 
[00:39:30]  I can drink, and no one even knows.  She would drink, and after, her whole personality would drink.  She'd cross a line, and ho, ho, ho, man, did it just get nasty.  Now, did she, was she following you, or, you feel me?  Like, could y'all have gone, let's say, power gliding, or whatever, skateboarding together,  if you made that what you was going to do?  So basically, I'm trying to put you at fault a little bit.  Yeah, I hear you.  Could you have made this bitch do something other than drink? 
[00:40:00]  No, no.  It was pretty much.  There was inner blood.  And it was, you know, I enjoyed going out to the bars, too, you know?  If I decided maybe, hey, we're not going to the bars anymore, let's, you know, go to museums or something.  Right, right, right.  I don't know.  No, I think, you know, you should like to tip them back, but so did I, you know?  We'd be at the bar.  I was on, I was one of those typical white guys, suburban bar, dart league, fucking, like, 
[00:40:30]  drinking beers, playing darts every Tuesday and Thursday.  Hey, are you walking?  Yeah, of course, everyone.  Hey, Johnny, what's up?  Hey, Anthony, sit down.  Hey, beer.  All right, and upside down, shot glass in front of me.  Hey, you're backed up by Petey, Billy, Bobby.  He's there, like, all night, we're backing each other up, drunk, watching the games.  Hey, Tony, hi, Frank.  It was great, yeah.  The girl behind the bar, everybody.  It was one of those situations.  And she was a bartender, so she would be tending bar. 
[00:41:00]  I'd get done with the show, or before I was even doing a show when I was working for a living.  I'd get done with work, you know, it's like 3.30, 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  I'd go to the bar.  It was off-Broadway out there in Greenland.  Greenland, sure.  I'd sit at that bar until she was done, about 8 o'clock.  Then she'd go on to the other side of the bar, and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, pounding,  pounding, get home about 10, 11 o'clock, smashed, get up for work the next day. 
[00:41:30]  That was pretty much the way the life went.  Wake up late, call into the radio in my truck.  16 to base, 16 to base.  I'm on my way in.  I just had to stop for gas.  Yeah, no, the battery was bad this morning, and I had a flat tire, and the tranny won't  engage.  That's why I'll be an hour late today.  I'll think of some new shit tomorrow when I'm late, but that's what I'm sticking to today.  And this is the radio.  This is even more.  No, that was before radio. 
[00:42:00]  This is just the air conditioning.  Yeah, that was pre-radio.  That's fucking unbelievable.  Then I got into radio.  I fall into fucking radio.  Opie discovers Anthony.  That's how it works.  And you almost didn't write the song.  You probably was just fucking like, ah.  Yeah, he was almost too hungover to write the song.  Come on, dude.  Let's write this song.  Whatever.  So then I get to the point where, after a while, I'm not making $27.5 a year anymore.  I'm doing a little better.  Right. 
[00:42:30]  A little better in Massachusetts after a while.  And then when we come to New York, I'm doing much better.  And then that's when things really got shaky.  Now, did she come to Massachusetts with you?  Yeah, her mother lived up there, so she loved it.  We lived a mile from my mother-in-law's house, which is another treat that I've talked about on the air.  Oh, man.  Let me tell you something.  I know you're on vacation, but could you just hang an electronic garage door opener in my garage, please? 
[00:43:00]  And that's how I spend my...  That's the mother-in-law.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talk exactly like that.  You married the drunkies.  It was the...  But, you know, I enjoyed...  I would go over the house, and I'd pour myself the biggest...  It was like a water glass of Captain Morgan and Coke.  And, wham, this shit would go down.  And I would like...  I'd be fine with it.  Hey, whatever. 
[00:43:30]  And let me tell you, we're going out.  I want to go get some lobster tonight.  And this was just me.  That's my life.  And it started getting a little shaky there.  And then we came to New York, and, you know, we started really doing much better.  And it wasn't so much a cash issue at that time.  And when I left, it was before we signed our...  What we call our big contract, the one that was reported in the paper.  And years went by before Dominic would settle. 
[00:44:00]  He wanted us to sign that deal before...  I would...  I was already out of the house.  I was out.  Out.  Out.  Working on a divorce.  He postponed, delayed, delayed, postponed, delayed.  So she got some of the fucking church money.  Some of the big money.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how lawyers work.  Wow.  Ruthless.  Wow.  Ruthless.  Let's go to Dave in Boston.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I actually witnessed one of the bar fights with Anthony's wife. 
[00:44:30]  Nice.  I used to work in Metro West, and there was a bar in front of me.  I mean, I can tell you what it is, because it's not there no more.  Ebeneezes.  Ebeneezes.  Right.  I used to go to Ebeneezes all the time.  You used to fight, too?  Oh, she would do.  I would just try to, like, I didn't like scenes.  I still don't.  I don't like a scene being made.  So I would try to, you know, sit down.  Just sit down.  Listen to these guys.  They used to make me laugh. 
[00:45:00]  I go to the bar, and here's Anthony with his head in his hands, sitting on the table.  And I'm going, what is this guy so miserable about?  And here she is yapping in his ear.  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  I witnessed a lot of them.  Are you serious?  A lot.  Ebbs.  I used to love Ebeneezes.  So you knew his wife?  The old train station.  So did Opie ever, like, try to figure out how to carefully cross the boundary of get this  bitch out your life? 
[00:45:30]  No one did.  Like, tickle you first?  Hey, Annie Booty.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  We're all like this.  Unless, until it's over.  When it's over, then everyone comes out of the woodwork and goes, dude, what the fuck were  you doing?  It's like, dude, I was there for nine years.  You couldn't have chimed in at year five, maybe?  I wish I knew you then.  Oh, Patrice, brutally honest.  We had some talks on the commute from Huntington to New York City.  And I know you all do, because white guys, when they talk to each other, there's a lot  of dudes who don't want to step over the boundaries, dude. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dude.  Wow.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Let's go to Dino.  Dino.  Dude.  Dude.  Dino, go.  Go ahead.  Man, you got to stop talking about divorce, man.  You got to be scared shitless.  This is my cringe factor.  Yeah.  I'm a physician.  I'm just coming out of residency, you know.  Oh.  Are you married?  Five years.  Got married in my intern year.  Five years.  Do you know that she is entitled to your future earnings as a doctor? 
[00:46:30]  If you get divorced, they will figure out.  They have these guys that come in that will assess your career.  And, of course, you're paying for them.  The guy that comes in, he's hired.  He comes in, makes this huge amount of money.  And he will determine, based on your past performance, where you are now, how much money  you will make in the future.  And based on that, you can get this flat fee you will have to dole out.  So, they're talking like, well, it could be $100 million.  So, you got to pay her $10 million cash right now, or we can work this deal. 
[00:47:00]  And I'm like, but I had $40,000.  That's all I had.  Where's this $100 million?  What you're worth.  So, it would have been better if you had got rid of her before you got into radio, because  your future...  It would have gotten...  If I got rid of her in 1990.  It would have been better.  If you're...  Because your future...  But see, guys like this, it's like everybody thinks they have this plan. 
[00:47:30]  I mean, I hope he's not married, but it's like this plan where I have to do this.  Like, he can't be a single doctor, or people will think he's gay, or he won't be able  to go to the functions or whatever.  And guys like this, when you talk, I hear you talk, these guys are the guys that get  their wives killed.  Like, they're fucking...  You're scared to death, and then he'll have somebody to fucking, all right, look, this  is what you need to do.  All right, make it look like an accident when you push her into the grill.  Right.  And close it away and cook her.  My problem was, I got successful in radio after I was married. 
[00:48:00]  So when I got married, I was a sheet metal worker making shit money, and then never thinking...  What am I going to...  I need a prenuptial agreement so she can't get my tin snips and hammer.  You should have sued her for the self-esteem that you gave her, because she managed you  thinking you was just going to be a fucking scumbag steel worker your whole life, and her 
[00:48:30]  fucking, her dreams went up when you decided that, when this fell into your lap, it's like  you should have brought Opie into this too.  You don't think all this was brought up in law offices?  I'm a goofy-ass steel worker.  Everything was brought up.  I had my friends that were ready to be subpoenaed, my close friends of years, including Adam Ferrara.  And I was going to be subpoenaed.  Joe Curry, you, they were all going to come in to testify that I was a funny guy, even 
[00:49:00]  before I knew her.  Because there was a claim that she, like, was very responsible for his...  For his funniness.  For my career, yes, to me being funny.  Amazed me where I sat.  I'm like, what?  I'm like, wait a minute.  I, but, what the, but I, but I made people laugh when I was, like, five.  That's what I did.  She sued you for your funniness?  My funniness.  But that's how divorce works.  The guy gets, fuck, you are entering in a contract.  If it was a business contract, any lawyer would tell you to run for your life. 
[00:49:30]  But for some reason, guys, feel free to sign away their careers, half their earnings, and  everything, based on, on nothing.  It's ridiculous.  All right, let's go to Rob in Virginia.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, uh, Anthony, uh, just a thought, uh, you know, fuck, punch it out.  Ha, he just went down in flames.  We waited a half hour to say that.  Let's go to, uh, Mike in California.  Mike?  Hey, guys, how's it going? 
[00:50:00]  Hey.  I got some sad news, man.  Uh, Howard sucks.  I, uh, I was really excited.  I, I subscribed to both services.  And, uh, I've just been disappointed, and it's week three.  And I'm, I'm really, I'm glad you guys are there, because I'm just so fucking disappointed.  Ah, yeah, he just doesn't have the passion to do this anymore.  He took the money and ran, and that's, God bless him for that.  But as far as doing an actual, uh, entertaining radio show, fuck no.  He's already going to spend, uh, another show today probably bitching about how the 
[00:50:30]  government's, the government is after him.  He's, he's getting old.  He's recording old bits.  And, uh, you know, fucking Backstreet Boys songs from five years ago.  Oh, wow.  That's, uh, that's great.  That's the revolutionary.  You're a funny motherfucker, man.  You're pretty much better than Howard.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  I appreciate that.  That's the revolutionary radio.  Gooch!  Mr. Comey, uh, can you please tell me when your wedding anniversary is?  Oh, yeah.  That was great.  They asked me that on the stand.  Now, this is.  I gotta hear your answer.  Dude, the worst part of this whole thing, too, was, the worst part of the whole deal 
[00:51:00]  was, and I know we've been through this, but there are some new listeners, so the old  listeners, just bear with me on this one.  Uh, Dominic is, uh, like I said, a very, a very good divorce attorney.  I hate to, I hate to plug him, give him a plug like that, but the guy knows his shit.  He knows how to get.  So, on the first day, I am to take the stand.  I look at the gallery, and there is a New York Post and a Daily News reporter there. 
[00:51:30]  Now, I am suspect that they were called and brought in, because some of the testimony could  be extremely embarrassing.  You're on the radio now.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  We, you know, we had, uh, we were rocking.  We're at our peak, man.  We are really rocking.  We are meeting with our agent, and numbers are going around that are head spinning.  So, yeah, I'm, we're at our peak on terrestrial radio.  Uh, and there's the Daily News and the Post.  Uh, reporters are in there, and they start asking all kinds of questions, and one of them  is, uh, uh, Mr. Cumia, uh, when is your wedding anniversary date? 
[00:52:00]  And I was so flustered.  I was, that was me.  I'm like, this is in the transcripts, by the way.  I, the, not only the transcripts, oh, yeah, mumble, mumble, mumble.  Not only in the transcripts, it was in the Post and the Daily News.  The next day.  Stutter.  When, uh, Mr. Cumia was asked what his wedding anniversary was, he could not remember.  I knew it was either March 19th or May 19th, because March 19th, growing up, was very important 
[00:52:30]  to me, because it was Swallows Day in San Juan Capistrano, and I used to live there, and  it was a big to-do, and parade, and everything.  Isn't that great?  He said March 18th or May 18th.  Or May, but I had no clue, and I just said.  It was the whole month, it wasn't, it wasn't, it's either February 19th or September 3rd.  I had no idea, so I just went, I don't know, I don't know, and it was like, Mr. Cumia  didn't even remember what his wedding anniversary was.  Oh.  And neither does nine out of ten motherfuckers in this world. 
[00:53:00]  So they start asking, uh, so Dominic starts asking about, like, sexual stuff, and now  I'm like, oh, shit.  I go, uh, Your Honor, um, I'd like to have a conference, please.  So, uh, yeah, it was me and the ex out in the hallway.  I'm like, okay.  All right, what do you want?  What do you need?  But what was the fear?  Was sexual stuff on what level?  What did you do?  What a lack of?  Yeah, you know, just certain things that might be brought up that, you know, it could have 
[00:53:30]  been me and my wife, and then there could have been another girl there, and there could,  there could have been things going on, Patrice.  Let's just leave it at, there could have been things.  Answer the question, Mr. Cumia.  All right, I had some side pussy.  There could have been things that didn't want to be brought up.  I rest my case.  Three boys. 
[00:54:00]  So at that point, looking at the Daily News and the Post guy, who are now salivating,  there's foam coming out of their mouths.  They're so happy.  I settled out.  I went in.  Asked what you wanted.  Right when the cheating shit.  He tapped out.  I tapped out.  I was like an extreme fucking fight.  Tapped out.  I was in the octagon.  The lawyer threw in the towel.  Tapped out.  Fuck, why didn't you lie?  You should have said, but we did it.  You should have said y'all were swingers or y'all did threesomes.  You should have fucking lied.  There was no proof. 
[00:54:30]  No proof that you didn't.  There's enough shit that it was enough where I just said enough.  Enough was enough.  You scared me, cat motherfucker.  You could have looked.  Damn it, man.  No, because even after all that, nothing's guaranteed in a divorce.  The judge could come back and have given her more money than I have to give her or less.  Could work out.  You just don't know.  So when I asked, it was just me and her.  Finally, after three years, it was just me and her in the hallway. 
[00:55:00]  Ham it out a deal.  That I was okay with.  She had like a toothpick hanging out of her mouth like, you know, all right, what?  What do you propose, pussy ass nigga?  That's good.  I saw you tap out.  What are you going to offer me that I ain't going to take?  I can't just get.  Yeah, I mean, what you going to give me, motherfucker?  Because I was just going to take it all.  What you going to offer me, less than all?  What was also bothering me was the fact that I had to pay her lawyer.  So I wanted that to stop as quickly as possible. 
[00:55:30]  How in God's name do they make you pay the fucking lawyer?  Isn't that amazing?  It's the law.  It's New York State.  That's how it is in New York.  That's how it is.  The guy gets reamed up the ass.  Oh, this bitch I'm with, she's in deep, deep trouble.  She's going to be my girlfriend for the rest of my life.  Any guy getting married out there needs a prenup.  I don't care if you're a plumber's assistant and you're making nine bucks an hour.  And there's no going against the prenup.  Because that seems like something that lawyers can probably work around. 
[00:56:00]  Yep.  You need a prenup.  I don't care what you do because you never know where you're going to be.  The phone's just exploded and there were some great calls.  Oh, you mean like bad exploded.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like there was a guy saying he's on his third marriage.  How?  How do these guys?  It's loneliness.  How?  It's a thing.  It's a lonely thing.  It's a self-esteem thing for you to think.  Look, marriage is a one-time thing.  Why not have 50 girlfriends?  Then you say, I'm going to take this chance.  Maybe like, you know, it's going to take at least 10 years of me being a woman for 10 
[00:56:30]  straight years for me to go, you know what?  You've been through enough.  And it would have to be the shit I put her through.  Yeah.  To get her to the point where you go, you know, she deserves at least to get a chunk of  me because I took a chunk of this bitch for 10 years, took some good years from her, you  know, maybe gave her a kid, maybe not, whatever, gave her a little bit, but you know what?  At least I can give her a marriage.  I can at least give her that fucking, because you know, a marriage to a woman, if you ask 
[00:57:00]  a woman with marriages, you think she would go, it's a union between two in front of God  and it makes us legitimate in the eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ.  No, it's security.  The bitch just wants to be able, in case you die, to continue to live and get money.  Right.  It's something, it's investment.  And it's like, you know what?  You'll get that when you fucking deserve it.  And if you ask a lot of guys, man, their wife don't deserve, it's just they pussy motherfuckers  get pushed up in a corner to that whole shit or get off the pot thing. 
[00:57:30]  Yep.  But you're taking away my good years.  He's like, I'm not ready to marry you yet.  I'm not ready to marry you.  You can go, you know what you can go do?  Find another husband.  And that's very hard to do because a man is a lottery ticket.  You know what I mean?  It really is.  That's why women are in a rush because they're like, look, lottery ticket.  If you ain't a winner, I need to scratch you, see if the shit is bullshit.  Right?  And then go try to find another lottery ticket.  That's really funny.  That's why they want to get married over a year or two. 
[00:58:00]  You're a scratch ticket.  And it's like, you're not a, look it, if you ain't going to marry me, man, this ticket's  no good.  It is an expiration date.  You don't want to leave it unscratched in the glove compartment for that long.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And then they go, if you don't do it, then I got to go start playing a lottery again  because they don't have their own skill base to like go and get a man and make him want  to marry her.  And the older the girl gets, it's not like she's getting the set for life tickets anymore.  Exactly.  She's getting those little, you know, you win two bucks here, five bucks there. 
[00:58:30]  It's athlete.  Women have to look at themselves as athletes.  It's, it's, it's an age, there is an age thing there.  You know, like I said, you come into the basketball league when you're 19, you can jump over everybody.  You can run fast and everybody, but when you get 30, man, you cannot, the games you play,  you have to learn different skills.  You have to learn a little stutter step.  You have to learn how to cheat.  You have to learn how to outdo.  But if you're trying to be 35 year old woman and you try to run with LeBron James and you 
[00:59:00]  try to run with Kobe Bryant, you're going to lose and your age is going to show.  So you have to learn skill levels over the years and they never do that.  Your wife, you're doing better.  You got to, you learn, you got a happier situation.  You are happy despite paying her and she's miserable because she, she doesn't have the  skills to get another guy.  She never, she's not going to find another guy, find another guy that going to put up with  is the lottery.  How many people will hit the lottery fucking twice in their life? 
[00:59:30]  You understand?  Just none.  So you is it.  Let's go to Timmy and Southie.  Timmy.  Hey, what's going on guys?  What's happening?  How are you, Timmy?  Hey, pretty good.  First, I just want to say, Patrice, I love you, man, but something weird has happened to  me since you've been on the show.  I, uh, I put the word motherfucker in every single sentence.  Yeah, I, uh.  My hookah.  My hookah, you're a regular person, I'll just, I'll be having a regular conversation  and go, you know, motherfucker, that's what I'll do.  You know, when Patrice is in here, the cursing has gone up. 
[01:00:00]  And, and that's fine now.  Let me, because it's just guys talking, you know, the, at first when we started this  satellite radio, we were all cursing because it's like, hey, this is really cool.  We can curse.  Now it's, uh, it's just coming out in normal conversation.  Yeah, I don't, I don't curse because I, I don't curse because I, I definitely don't  curse because I can.  But I, I listen to replays and there's a lot of motherfuckers.  Yeah, I, you know.  It's all motherfuckers.  I know, all right, what do you got, Timmy?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, man, that doctor, screw him, man.  I've been listening to your divorce stories for like, geez, I don't know, it's been at  least since 2000. 
[01:00:30]  I can remember one time going out, and we were either on BCN or AF, whatever it was, and  I was going out of range and actually pulled off the highway just to listen to the rest  of the story.  So screw him, keep talking, it's probably therapeutic for you.  All right, Timmy, thank you.  Yeah, those stories are great.  Let's go to, uh, Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Um, I know the best way to get out of divorce.  Yeah.  You go uptown to Washington Heights, buy an ounce of heroin, bag it up, put it in the  car, and have your girlfriend call the cops on it.  That old gag.  Yeah, you plant drunk.  Yeah, that's great.  You end up in prison and, uh, for planting evidence. 
[01:01:00]  Listen to what happened.  Did you watch CSI?  Listen to what happened to John.  John?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  A friend of mine, uh, got a loan right out of college, took all the money, and built  the house.  He literally designed it from the ground up and went over there and worked on it every  night after he got out of work.  So he gets married a couple years later.  Wife moves into his house.  He comes home from work one night, finds his wife in his bed with another guy.  She files for divorce from him.  First thing the judge does is tells him, my friend, to get out of the house. 
[01:01:30]  Get out the house.  Yep.  So the woman naturally moves in with the dude.  And, uh, in the, and by the way, my friend has to pay all the bills the whole time.  He's got to pay the mortgage.  He's got to pay all the, uh, all the utilities.  So this bastard can live in his house that he built with his, his still current wife at  that point.  Divorce gets settled.  Naturally, the woman gets the, you know, gets the house, moves in with the guy, of course.  And, um, they got busted out.  They couldn't pay the mortgage, couldn't pay anything.  They moved back in with this dude's mom. 
[01:02:00]  And so the ex-wife and the, the, you know, the guy are living with the mom.  And his house is up on the market, the one that he built.  Broke.  Yep.  Totally.  Everybody's broke.  Right.  My friend, he didn't even want it anymore after, during the divorce, because he couldn't even  afford to pay the bills anymore.  You go from starting out, young guy, trying to be successful to being broke.  I had a, I had a, I was renting a house in Huntington.  Thank God I didn't own a house.  And thank God we didn't have kids.  That's the two things that are like, thank you, God.  Or there would be a connection forever. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, forever.  So, uh, we had a house out in Huntington, Long Island.  And after the $40,000 thing happened, I'm like, there's no way I'm going to now call  her up and ask her for my possessions in the house.  Right.  Because those things are now hostage, uh, that can be used to negotiate.  I didn't have a lot of things, but there were some things I wanted.  My computer equipment, a few toys, little things like that.  So I waited until she was gone one day, uh, went to the back door, smashed the little  window out, and, uh, crawled through there. 
[01:03:00]  And got my stuff, loaded it into the truck.  But, uh, here's the kind of criminal I am.  Here's the kind of bad guy I am.  I swept the glass up, sealed the hole back up so the cats wouldn't get out, and left a  note.  And she was pretty much raping him at the thought.  I should have left the cats hanging on the shower curtain rod.  You did the right thing.  You did the right, the, the, the one weapon against women that men don't have to understand, 
[01:03:30]  the one secret weapon is not to care.  Even if you do, you pretend like the guy who finds his wife fucking in the bed, you go,  you go, whew, thank God you did this, now I can get out of this whole situation.  Oh, the not care.  You all, it's, it, it, it may backfire from time to time, but, hey, you're fucking another  guy?  Oh, my God, thank God I was waiting for you to get some more dick so I could leave you.  It's just, they can't, they can't function when you don't have a drop of feeling about 
[01:04:00]  them.  When you don't have a, uh, like, if you had gone, oh, thanks, sweetie, you know what,  I should have did this before, you deserve more, I'm just gonna give you what the cords  give you, but it, it, it really, it's costing me less in my soul.  Than it is paying you.  So it's like, freeze my soul, you can have the money, enjoy your life, and I could just  get me another woman that I'm happy with.  Woo!  Thank you, Pumpkin, for being a cunt.  Mwah!  Mwah!  Let's go to Doug Out Dog.  Doug!  What's going on?  Hey, Patrice.  Yeah, I, I kind of did something like that. 
[01:04:30]  I didn't involve the court or anything.  When my, uh, ex-wife confronted me with the pictures of, uh, me leaving the hotel room  with my current girlfriend, um, she just looked at me in the eyes and said, we can work things  out, baby, if you just sign these papers.  As I signed the papers, she never, ever went to a single counseling session with me.  She took me for everything. 
[01:05:00]  And I was a crushed, broken man.  Jesus.  And then I, and I gave the excuse, it was great, I gave the excuse when she asked me just what  I was doing in the hotel room, because she had a private eye, follow me.  Um, I, I told her that we were both tired during work, so we went and laid down, uh, at a hotel  room during a lunch break.  I laid, I laid in a pussy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I fully expected to remember that.  I got, I had arrested somewhere, huh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I was, well, a warm safe place. 
[01:05:30]  Why does your face smell like a badone?  Oh, I just fell asleep right on my face, right on the pussy.  Whew!  I'm in a warm safe place for, uh, my dick.  Uh, I had a, uh, cheating incident once where I was, uh, I was cheating on a girl  that I was living with back in, oof, 88, I guess it was, somewhere around there.  I'm trying to think.  You don't believe in karma?  How can you be mad at us?  Like, you deserve it.  You deserve a fetal.  No, this is going back, and this is like back when, you know, 
[01:06:00]  it wasn't real relationships.  This is bullshit.  We were more like roommates.  And I come home, and I'm like, I can't walk in the house like this.  I cannot walk in the house like this.  So I had a Volkswagen that used to break down all the time,  and I popped the gas line out and just covered myself in gas,  reached underneath the oil pan, oil, all of my arms and stuff, 
[01:06:30]  and, of course, I was late.  Oil and pussy.  So I come in all mad.  You smell like a sardine.  I come in all pissed off.  Boom.  Ah, fucking car.  God damn it.  No, don't even come near me.  I'm covered in gas and oil.  I'm getting right in the shower.  Mother fucking car.  Son of a bitch.  Right into the shower.  You know about cars?  It's like, what?  What car?  What happens to a car where it explodes?  Gas and oil and...  And oil.  Yeah, what do you think?  Isn't the oil in the front and the gasoline is in the back? 
[01:07:00]  I'm just, oh, it's all over.  Brake fluid, tranny fluid.  What's the...  I got everything.  I got windshield washer fluid.  I got to put in my hair.  I got to get this.  Ah, I need to shower.  Ah, the ashtrays went off on me.  Did the car explode?  Shouldn't you have shrapnel on your back, too?  Oh, my God.  He was fucking coming with...  I'm going to tell you what this dirtbag...  I can't say his name.  This is the dirt...  Filthiest dirtbag move I've ever heard in my life. 
[01:07:30]  It was almost genius.  It was so fucked up.  He fucking cheats on his girl, right?  Fucks.  Doesn't take a shower.  Right?  Smelling like whatever girl is fucking...  Whore.  This son of a bitch runs home, right?  He goes...  He breaks in his door and acts like he's having a fit of passion with his woman.  Like he can't control herself.  Like, I'm going to fuck you, baby.  And just...  And fucks her so that the sex smell...  Oh, man.  He can think it's them.  She can think it's their fucks. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  Wow.  It was the dirtiest move I've ever heard.  What, he fucking put a clothespin on her nose first?  He goes, you are so sexy.  Boom.  Boom.  Oh, my God.  This room smells like...  We fucking so well, it smells like other people.  Let's go to...  Baby, for the foreplay, breathe through your mouth only.  I've heard that's really good.  Let's go to Megan in Boston.  Megan.  Hey, how are you?  All right.  I need to know how Anthony met this little charming douchebag. 
[01:08:30]  Wow.  Jeez.  A little harsh.  Oh, the ex?  The ex-wife?  Let's see.  Let's see.  Oh, God.  It was through my brother.  Yeah.  Is that who you have to blame for that?  Yeah.  She was, like, banging my brother or something.  This was your brother's fucking side.  My brother's throwaway.  Your second?  Your brother's seconds?  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  You in this motherfucker.  I don't...  You was covered in, though, while he was fucking her, though, right?  She was looking real hot.  No.  Even her drunkness was hot when your brother was fucking her.  Where do you know?  No.  It just wasn't like that.  You got to know not to marry a chick that would do that, dude.  Somehow...  I didn't know shit back then.  I was stupid.  I was stupid.  How old was you back then?  Physically or mentally?  I was about, you know, just entering my 30s, I guess.  I was still late 20s. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  But, you know, I was still, you know, with me, my brother, and our band thinking, you  know, we were going to be the next rock stars and just working just enough to make enough  money to have it crumbled up in my pocket for the bar.  You know, so I wasn't Mr. Responsibility.  I thought being married would boost me to the next level where I would then kind of become  like an adult because I still, no matter where I went, I was a kid.  Yeah.  You know, my mother and all her crowd that she hung out with at the bar she was tending 
[01:10:00]  at, like I would go there and I was always the kid.  I'm like, I'm almost 30 and I'm still like, hey, it's Rosie's kid, you know?  I was like, when am I not going to be a kid?  And I thought maybe that would propel me to this level of manhood.  Right, right.  Adulthood.  And it was just...  Do you feel like an adult now?  More so than I ever have, but...  Yeah, I don't...  You?  No, absolutely not.  More, like, for some reason we have decided never to grow up in it. 
[01:10:30]  I feel more adult-like.  You know why?  And the only reason is because I'm looked at by people as an adult.  Yeah.  Like, we got fucking, you know, Derek and Thann and fucking...  Yeah, we got you.  Travis.  We got you all around us.  They look at us like we're adults.  Right.  The fact that you're running a ship here.  Running a show is...  Yeah, yeah.  When it was just me and Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show, for many years, was  Opie and Anthony.  Period.  That was it. 
[01:11:00]  There was no other people.  There was no third mic.  There was no producers.  There was no nothing.  Just me and him walking into a studio.  Walking in.  That was it.  That was it.  And then when you start having other people relying on you doing shit, which was, you  know, really glaringly apparent when we got fired and other people also got their asses  thrown out the door based on, you know, what we did, that all of a sudden, that clicks  you up again.  Like, all right, I don't feel like it, but what I do affects other people's lives. 
[01:11:30]  See, I'm not there yet.  I have a...  I'm incorporated.  I have a company with no employees.  I'm a CEO of no employees.  Like, I'm like, I have a company and I make you feel like...  When I buy...  When I fill up my gas tank, I'm proud of it.  Like, when I don't just put in 20 bucks and it goes...  The corporation is...  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  It's like...  Jeez.  Let's go to Chuck in Albany.  We want to wrap this up because we have so much to do today.  We got the Daily News coming in.  They're doing a little feature on us today. 
[01:12:00]  It's an exciting day for the program.  Chuck, Albany, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  You kick ass, man.  Hey.  Fall for divorce in March.  Real quick, fellas.  Fraternity test in April.  Tests came back on my two kids.  Found out they weren't mine in June.  I have to pay that con...  684 bucks weekly.  Weekly.  For child support on kids that aren't even...  New York state law, man.  New York state law.  Once those kids, after the age of four years old, man, that's it. 
[01:12:30]  You're fucked.  You got to pay until they're 18 or until they finish college.  For kids that ain't yours?  For kids that ain't mine.  And I filed for the divorce.  It was granted a divorce due to...  You know who's writing a book on this whole divorce in New York thing?  It's Alec Baldwin.  He's had it.  Oh, that must have happened.  He's jumping up and down all over the place.  But he hates fucking Kim Bateson.  Yeah, but he fucking hates her.  But he's exposing all this stuff we're talking about in a book.  He's going to get a lot of attention because of the book, too. 
[01:13:00]  He's going to talk about the system, the lawyers, all that shit.  Well, something needs to clean up, man, because I filed.  I got granted a divorce on adultery and fucking mental cruelty, and she still got that cash.  Wait, do you love the kids, though?  Yeah, I love the kids, but goddamn, I'm...  But he doesn't love them that much.  Thank you, goddamn, sir.  I love them enough to maybe get them some ice cream every once in a while, and they can go to Toys R Us for a toy, but...  I'll take them to Disney on ice once a year, but fuck. 
[01:13:30]  I love them, but I don't love them.  That's right.  Fuck that.  It's 24%, man.  They started putting cancer in their food.  All right, Chuck.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, you guys kick ass, man.  Yeah, we know that.  Thanks, Chuck.  Thanks, Chuck.  We appreciate it.  Let's go to Danny in Jersey.  Danny.  Hey, guys.  You guys are awesome.  Patrice, you rock.  Listen, I got to thank Anthony real quick.  Got out of a divorce.  2,500 bucks.  No alimony. 
[01:14:00]  But Jersey's the best.  Listen, guys, check this out.  Anthony.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  Hooked up with this Puerto Rican chick, right?  Not sure.  I haven't played the game in a very long time.  I have to go home now to the wife, the ex to me.  I'm saying to myself, my hands smell like cunt like you wouldn't believe.  Figuring the shit out of her all night.  What do I do?  I use that spare tire in the back that I blew out, rub brake dust all over my shoulder, and straight to the shower.  Straight to the shower.  Don't come near me.  Oh, I'm filthy.  Oh, don't come near me.  We have some talented listeners out there. 
[01:14:30]  I smell a new country song straight to the shower.  Straight to the shower.  I smell a song.  Puerto Rican pussy and brake dust.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  I went straight to the shower.  It's coming in.  You watch.  Well, thank God my truck was a-leaking oil.  It cost a grab me a handful, and I ran straight for the shower. 
[01:15:00]  You were flammable.  I came in flammable.  You was a fucking bomb.  You was a walking bomb just to cover up your porch.  Just in case, if she figured it out, I could have just lit myself up like a Hindu protesting.  Motherfucker, I know that old oil-gas trick, motherfucker.  You've been fucking.  No, no, I've been fixing the car.  There's no physical way for you to get oil and gas on, you asshole.  All right, you're on to me.  I had to blow a tire to prove it.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:15:30]  Very good.  Where did this come from?  What is it?  E-Rock hands me an old newspaper article.  E-Rock.  You know, because the new listeners don't understand how deep the hatred goes for Howard Stern.  First of all, Howard's best friend was Ant's ex's divorce lawyer, so there were problems there.  And there's a quote in this article, Stern gets personal.  Opie and Anthony yanked off the air for getting Howard riled up again.  Where'd you find this fucking thing?  Oh, you brought it in?  Who's that guy?  He's a friend of yours.  Oh, he's a friend of yours, and he just happened to have this today? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  That is so weird.  Wow, what a coincidence.  No, because it's exactly what we're talking about.  Wow.  What, he wants us to sign this?  Usually, like, fans come in and they want us to sign old newspaper articles and stuff.  So this guy, who's just a friend of Ben's, who showed up out of nowhere, we're talking about Anthony's divorce and hands an article that I guess he wants us to sign after the show.  It's from the New York Post, and there's a huge quote here.  It says, it's from Stern, shut your mouth or I'll bring your wife in here, the one you're divorcing that nobody knows about.  Ah, yeah, that's great. 
[01:16:30]  Go ahead.  There is nothing she could say that I haven't said on the air.  And that's why we talk about Howard and his daughters.  How about you talk about your divorce, Howard?  How about you go on and talk about what a treat it must have been for that poor woman to live with your sorry fucking ass every day.  Go ahead.  There is nothing.  I think I said this when this article came out, didn't I?  Yeah, this is great.  It was like, yeah, he's threatening.  He was threatening like it's going to be some kind of John DeBella fucking scenario where some ex-wife comes on his show and spills her guts. 
[01:17:00]  There's nothing I didn't talk about on the air about that situation.  I don't think it said word one about his divorce.  How much you have to give her?  Oof.  Now that must be some bill.  That has to be some bill.  How much of that half a billion is she still getting?  Yeah, you've got to think she's getting some of that.  This is pretty fun, though.  Opie and Anthony yanked off the air for getting Howard riled up again. 
[01:17:30]  Just in case you thought all this shit we talk about from time to time is bullshit.  The radio feud between Howard Stern and the team of Opie and Anthony has grown so intense that Stern is now threatening to bring in Anthony's ex-wife for a kiss-and-tell expose.  Shut your mouth or I'll bring your wife in here, the one you're divorcing that nobody knows about, a furious Stern told listeners yesterday.  Nobody knows about.  I could in two seconds.  Believe me, the stories aren't too good.  No, they're great.  Meantime, Opie and Anthony banned from even mentioning Stern's name months ago. 
[01:18:00]  See?  It's all reported.  It's all out there.  We didn't make it up.  Just Google our names.  Mentioning Stern's name months ago were mysteriously AWOL yesterday, causing speculation that they were either suspended or subjected to front office thrashing that lasted through their entire five-hour program.  Thank you.  Another thrashing by management.  That's what the people in the radio world, they don't get it.  They do their fake suspensions and stuff.  If you're a brave broadcaster, you get suspended for real. 
[01:18:30]  That's the difference between us and the rest of the pack.  And it's not a week off where they take a vacation and go, he's been suspended.  We get a day here, a day there, and they're like, no, you're just not going on today.  I can't tell you how many times we got suspended.  It was like, another day to play golf.  That's all it matters.  We didn't give a shit.  We loved it.  On Tuesday, ONA crowed that they had slipped one over on a certain radio show host in Stern's song parody contest.  Oh, this was great.  Oh, I forgot.  Oh, I forgot all about this.  This was payback.  God, there was so much back and forth back then. 
[01:19:00]  We had so much payback.  We had pests from the beginning, by the way.  We're just finally acknowledging that this whole pest mentality exists, and we're encouraging these fuckers.  But it's always been part of our show.  We've always had a very interactive radio show with our listeners, and pests give us reports every single day.  Anyway, Stern unwittingly played an entry from Anthony's brother Joe, a regular contributor to ONA on the air.  This story is so fucking good, and fucking Imus, to this day, talks about this with me. 
[01:19:30]  He goes, that was fucking brilliant.  It was brilliant.  He's doing our stuff, and he doesn't even know it.  It said a clucking and gloating Opie.  Did you cluck that?  Did you cluck and gloating?  Yeah.  Lichen de chicken.  Oh, clucking and gloating.  Da-da-da-da.  Clucking and gloating.  This is one of the better fucking stories, man.  The team told listeners that they'd had more to say about the contest prank on Wednesday. 
[01:20:00]  But instead, NEW listeners heard a slapped-together best-of show while the station's switchboard reportedly told callers that ONA were in a meeting and should be on the air live shortly.  But they never were.  Spokesman for Viacom, owner of both NEW and Stern's K-Rock show, declined to comment except to say ONA took a vacation day.  Yeah, see, this is what they used to have to do.  Any hack jock will take a vacation, and the people say, they were suspended. 
[01:20:30]  Horruff, horruff.  With us, they suspended us and had to say we were on vacation.  Right.  They took a vacation day out of nowhere.  Vacation day.  Hey, Ope, let's go to Barbados for the day.  All hell's breaking loose around us, and we need a day off.  No, we would always get in there and fight.  Jesus Christ.  We fight to this day.  Kumia, who is an accomplished song parodist, that's Anthony's brother, produced at least one Stern contest entry called Fat Naked Fag, 
[01:21:00]  a riff on Survivor Millionaire Richard Hatch.  Yeah, Howard was doing this hack bit where he was getting song parodies, and we had more than one in the top five.  Yeah, yeah, in the top five.  That we submitted ourselves, and he's ranting and raving on his show how great this song is, and he's playing it over and over again.  Oh, was he pissed when he found out.  And then we fucking broke it to everyone on our show that that great song that Howard's talking about every day is our song.  Actually, they both were really good. 
[01:21:30]  The other one was a parody of Everlong by the Foo Fighters, which was really good as well.  We had two in the top five, and it was a huge contest.  It was a huge prize they were giving away.  It was a real big deal, and we snuck two in there, and they were in the top five.  Our fucking boss is wanting us fired that day, because this fucking loser can't take this at all on any level.  That was one of the situations I totally forgot about until right now.  There have been so many meetings with the bosses where we were threatened with our jobs about Howard,  and I completely forgot about this one. 
[01:22:00]  What was the job threat?  Talk about Howard, and you'll be fired.  Yeah, simple as that.  That was it.  Fuck with his contest or his show, and you'll be fired.  Unbelievable.  And this is all Howard had to say about it.  They have a quote in this article.  Do something original on your own program.  Stern rallied yesterday after a caller blew the whistle.  But we were doing something original.  Right.  It wasn't original at all.  We just decided to play it on your show.  Play it on your show.  Why not?  Because you used to say how we were hacks and stuff.  So we were showing you how brilliant we actually were by giving you material that you said was brilliant. 
[01:22:30]  I mean, think of the audience that got to hear our material.  Right.  And my brother's material.  I've got so many imitators.  It's like, love me, Daddy.  Please love me.  Pay attention to me, Mark Stern.  That's where the love me, Daddy quotes came from.  Hey, Howie, if you maybe would have listened to the one that really was crying love me, Daddy, your daughter Emily, she might not have been naked on a fucking stage in some Jewish production of God knows what. 
[01:23:00]  Maybe the love me, Daddy's.  Maybe if you didn't hear us in your head.  This just has to fucking stop.  Somebody has to die.  Yeah, maybe if you heard that, instead of imagining us yelling love me, Daddy, and heard the real girl that was yelling love me, Daddy.  When you left your family.  And she got into a naked play. 
[01:23:30]  My vagina.  Rappers don't go this long without somebody getting shot.  That's the real love me, Daddy.  That's the real love me, Daddy.  Don't worry about us.  And then another quote from Howard in this article.  I'm not your daddy, stupid ass, Grout Stern.  We got so under his skin.  My vagina.  And then Imus was on his show, which is also owned by the company, laughing and thinking it's the greatest thing ever.  We learned a long time ago that poor Howard Stern can't take a joke. 
[01:24:00]  Can't take a joke.  Stern has never mentioned his afternoon counterparts by name, and they have been forbidden to mention his.  Well, he did start mentioning our name as soon as we got fired and we couldn't fight back, by the way.  That's a fact.  Their feud erupted last February when ONA crashed a news conference for Stern's TV show, Son of the Beach, and were promptly ejected by Stern.  ONA returned to fire in April.  What a clusterfuck this was.  Holy shit, I forgot all this stuff.  Let me ask you guys this. 
[01:24:30]  Don't, doesn't, I was listening to Stern when I was a kid, you know, coming up.  It's like he, doesn't he have the weaponry you guys are?  Aren't you two fair countries?  He's like, your armies are just as powerful as you.  We assumed.  Dude, we didn't have an army when we went after him.  Now we got the power behind us, but we were just two dicks that weren't going to take his shit.  We assumed that he would fight back and we were totally ready for it, but he never really fought back on the air.  Like you got the Ramon thing and he had the Baba Boo thing. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  Doesn't he have the, it's like y'all, it's China and U.S. in this situation, isn't it?  We're proud to say we were the first radio show that he didn't know how to handle and did not go after.  So just ran to management and we went right to Mel Karmazin.  We're proud to say we were the one that he couldn't take on.  Yeah, all the other ones just folded.  It's a fact that's been written about many, many times.  All the other ones, I mean, and some of them are historic.  The DiBella situation, those two clowns out in California.  Mark and Brian. 
[01:25:30]  Mark and Brian.  I mean, those are just brutal beatings that Howard gave those guys because their program directors told them the best way to deal with Howard is to ignore him.  That's what we do.  So when he attacks, you just ignore him and it'll go away and he wound up crushing them.  And we knew that.  So we weren't going to take any shit.  And that's where it started.  That's where it started.  And we are, like, you know, I'm pretty humble when it comes to this show and, you know, when people compliment us, it's thank you and everything like that. 
[01:26:00]  But when it comes to battling, if someone shoots a pea shooter at us, we pull out a cannon and just fire it back.  Like, it's ruthless.  Were you ever nervous at any point?  Like, okay, when you got together, did you take one gulp and go, all right.  Nervous that we were going to be fired a couple of times.  I'm never nervous about him and what he can do?  No.  Fuck no.  I said in the Long Island Press article we did recently, they asked that question and I said, I haven't been scared of that guy in 12 years. 
[01:26:30]  There was a time 12 years ago when I was doing this radio thing?  Sure.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like, that's being honest right there.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  But for the last 12 years, absolutely not.  The Juggernaut, it's just like, okay, at the time he was fucking, he's, you know, Juggernaut.  So it's like, was it like you just go, whew, all right, Ant, you ready for this?  Or was you just like, what, motherfucker?  No.  It was just like, come on.  Bring it.  Bring it on.  Yeah.  Bring it the fuck on.  We were ready.  So listen, these three paragraphs are really funny in this old article. 
[01:27:00]  Their feud erupted last February when ONA crashed a news conference for Stern's TV show, Son of the Beach, and were promptly ejected by Stern.  He waited in his limo outside the hotel.  He didn't do shit.  He had all his people behind the scenes do it.  He waited in a limo until we left the hotel, and then he walked in to do a stupid press conference.  ONA returned the fire in April by blowing the whistle on a surprise rock concert announcement Stern had been promising.  That's the oldest gag in radio, you know, but. 
[01:27:30]  And last month, Stern show regular high-pitch Eric was arrested for making a bomb threat on ONA's answer machine.  I forgot about that.  High-pitch Eric's threatening to kill you, motherfucker?  Yeah, and he got arrested for.  A bomb threat on my answer machine.  He was going to blow you up.  He's going to kill you, motherfucker.  Oh, my God, he's a bitch on the radio threatening to kill you.  God damn.  High-pitch.  And then finally, we had two in the top five in the song parody contest.  Incidentally, Stern will announce his $10,000 grand prize winner this morning. 
[01:28:00]  This is an old article, but.  So he was giving out $10,000.  And Anthony's brother would have won if we kept quiet.  We should have kept quiet until Brother Joe got to $10,000 and then blown the whistle on it.  It would have made an even better story.  Like, oh, God.  Funny shit.  God damn.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've been at it an hour and a half.  Yeah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[01:28:30]  Memories.  Memories.  Yes.  You go on for a half an hour about each of those different events, too.  Oh, I know.  I know.  You know, Platinum Records getting shattered.  Oh, I know.  We've got all the stories where he was breaking shit in his office because he was just, he just did not know how to handle us.  Where's my daughter?  Where's my daughter?  Where's my daughter?  They're hot.  They're hot.  They're hot.  And one's just got the biggest set of tits.  The big Jewish tits.  G-I-T-T.  You just want to stick one between it. 
[01:29:00]  Ooh, you're Howard's daughter, aren't you?  Yeah, he hung up on me in 86.  I'm just going to bang you.  Bang.  Howard's daughter.  Bang, bang, stick one between it.  Oh, the soiling.  I think that's wonderful, Howard.  That con is a bitch.  A lot of people asking us about censorship in satellite radio because it's a hot topic lately. 
[01:29:30]  Yes, it certainly is.  We don't have censorship here, ladies and gentlemen.  Nope.  We can now talk about Howard freely and how he's a hypocrite and a fucking phony.  Try, try, try  Try now  Try, try, try  Try now  So before my penis starts to get sore 
[01:30:00]  Don't pick up some bad you look at your local  Cavalo Center  Yeah, the Stern, Emily Stern remixes continue to come in, by the way  Yes  First, you saw the infamous sexy home videotapes of Pamela and Tommy Lee making love 
[01:30:30]  Now, for the first time, the stolen video sex tapes of Howard Stern  Oh, baby  Oh, I'm so horny for you all  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, it's all good, baby  It's all good  I'm so lucky, baby  You're the sexiest woman on earth, baby  Howard, who are you talking to?  Oh, I don't know one  I'm not talking to anyone 
[01:31:00]  All right, I gotta go  Before you go, do me a favor, give me some tissues, honey  Just a few that have come in  Ah, it's funny shit  We have at least another 30 to go through  We'll play some more of the better ones  All right, Patrice O'Neill in studio  We got the clips of Bush sounding drunk  From WebJunk 20  Okay  And the John Dacre clip  Is that how you say his name?

[01:32:30]  Looking at the ceiling  With tears of regret and sorrow  Rolling down the sides of my face  Just follow the simple steps  And you'll have the perfect wedding  Just like  And  Eh, I got nothing  I was shocked  I was horrified  I was broke  Hopeless  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave  Never marry a lot  I was a broken, beaten man  And I had been married for six hours 
[01:33:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program  It's the only virus spreading across America  Thanks to you  And you  And you  And you  And you  And you  And you  And you  And you 
[01:33:30]  And you  And all the people on Pal Talk  All the ONA Pess out there  It's a lot of fun doing this radio show every day  Teresa O'Neil in studio  We finally changed the music  I know  You guys will make that into a promo  So  Whatever  Fuckers  The youth of America 
[01:34:00]  Making fun of the old guys  I start doing the math  I look at these guys  You know  And we're not even that old  And I'm like  Man, I started radio  And these guys were still like  Taking dumps and diapers  Shitting themselves  Anyway  One event  Some of them still do  After a night of drinking  Well  They shit themselves  I almost said absolutely there  But I'm trying to not say absolutely as much  Where I sit  I didn't even hear it  There you go  You're too busy trying to say finger right  This guy 
[01:34:30]  Mike  He just brought in a whole bunch of old Opie and Anthony articles  And here's another one that's really funny  You gotta go through all the articles you brought in  Because we could do this all morning  It's a huge headline in one of the New York papers  From about maybe a year and a half ago now  Who wrote that?  David Hinkley  Well  David Hinkley's coming in today to do a little feature on the boys  That's right  And  David might have missed the mark on this one a little bit 
[01:35:00]  But do you see what's going on here?  Yeah  Tick  Tick  Tick  We're ticking up again  Oh we destroyed our careers  It was just ugly  Yeah it was pretty much over Johnny  But now it's just going  Quite a while  Tick  Tick  Tick  I love the slow build  Slowly but surely  We've always done it  Our whole career has been based on the consistent build  We go up consistently  I'd rather that than the big hype  Jesus  And then the big letdown  He's got a cartoon 
[01:35:30]  We made the political cartoons  I was in hiding during a lot of this time  So I really don't remember it  Well they got a station manager  With a clipboard  With me and Anthony crying outside the studio  We used to broadcast in  This is a cartoon I'm looking at now  And it says Opie on the back  Anthony on the back of his shirt  We're crying our eyes out  And for some reason they have me with my right hand on your ass  Hey  I don't get that 
[01:36:00]  We captured that moment  And then in the studio where we used to broadcast  Is Clinton taking our place  Ha ha ha  And the station management says in this cartoon  Sorry guys we found a replacement  Ah I get it  And then you see the booth  And it's Bubba  Bubba Clinton doing his show  And it says  I'm shocked Opie and Anthony would defile a secret institution  Who do they think they are?  Me?  Ah  Because the blowjob in the Oval Office 
[01:36:30]  It's hysterical  Wow  That's bad  Dude I don't know what this one's about  You gotta explain these  This is just a long involved one  I can't go there  The best and the worst  I'm not that good  Anyway so David Hinckley from the Daily News  This is about a year and a half ago  Another article that Mike brought in  The headline is really funny  Because it just says  Sirius likely to relaunch Opie and Anthony's show 
[01:37:00]  Hey how about that  We're going to be on Sirius  How'd that fall through?  Oops  Ha ha ha  What happened to that one?  What happened?  They both won us really bad  Yep  What did it boil down to?  Uh technology  Boiled down to  More subscriptions  The better company  More subscriptions  Better technology  Oh okay  XM  Before I give you guys credit  Uh huh  Was it you  You two were like  As fast as you said technology  Was that you?  They were already moving  Or was it your people? 
[01:37:30]  Did that  People like  People surround your ages and stuff  You know we're not stupid  Nah we pretty much  I didn't call you stupid motherfucker  But that is like  To say  Hey the technology  I don't know  I'm a student of this game  If I'm going to satellite radio  I'm going to do my own research  We went to both companies  The technology of the radio  I learned all that stuff  We went to both companies  Went to their headquarters  I taught the panelists  I taught  Yeah  We looked at all their stuff  Talked to their tech guys  Who showed us  What was coming up  The technology they had available 
[01:38:00]  At the time  It was kind of funny  What was like right around the corner  Because at  Sorry to interrupt you Anthony  At the time  We had access  That no one else had  We got to get inside  Both headquarters  And these two companies  Hated each other  Since day one  And we were able to get  Behind closed doors  In both companies  Because they both  Really wanted us badly  They did  And  That is unheard of  From what we saw  And what we heard  XM was the better company  Wasn't even close  They still are 
[01:38:30]  They're light years ahead  In technology  And when you say  The business model  The my five  When you look at  When you look at  The systems that people  Are listening to  Sirius through  And look at the systems  That people listen to  XM through  It's ridiculous  And coming up  In a couple of months  That new portable unit  That XM is coming out with  And real portable  Which means you can  Walk around  And get live  XM satellite radio  In a unit 
[01:39:00]  That is no bigger  Than a cell phone  Hey you know what  Don't confuse people  We have that already  We're just making it better  Making it better  We're making it smaller  And we're adding more  Bells and whistles  Features  Now you can download  All your mp3s  Right into the system  Easier interface  That's not what  Well we have the  My five  We got the tau  And we got the  Pioneer airware  Whatever it's called  And is it called  An airware  I forget now  I don't have that one  So we got three units  Right now  Where you can walk  Around the streets  And listen live  Satellite radio  Live satellite radio 
[01:39:30]  What car do they have  To deal with  General Motors  And then a whole bunch  Now GM has to deal  With both radios though  They make decisions  Before you confuse  Everybody  You know  They have car deals  We have car deals  But as far as  That game goes  We have so much  More in the market  A much higher percentage  And GM cars  Roll off the assembly line  With XM  In it  Ready to go  Anyway  And that portable unit  Is amazing  That we saw at CES  Yeah so now 
[01:40:00]  They don't even have one  That could actually do this  Yeah  And ours  Our second generation  Of this stuff  Is coming out in a month  Two months from now  Which is  Smaller  And now you can  Throw all your  MP3s in it  They're  Putting out these  Press releases  That make it sound  Like they have  A portable unit  It's some kind of  You know  On the go unit  But you have to  Dock it  With a docking station  Download programming  And then you can leave  And listen to it  And as Jimmy Norton 
[01:40:30]  Said congratulations  You've reinvented  The tape recorder  So the XM  The Wi-Fi  Is like a Walkman  Yeah  You can  Oh my god  Yep  Yep  It's amazing  And that  That like  Floored us  Right there  Both companies  Wanted us  Badly  Yep  We were going to  Pick XM  And then something  Weird happened  With the little  Doggy company  That we still  Haven't talked about  Yet  But it had  Something to do  With Howard  That's a little tease  I know  We'll get into that  Another day  So this article 
[01:41:00]  That Mike the cop  Brought in  Sirius likely  To relaunch  Opie and Anthony  Show  This is from  A year and a half ago  Bill Burr  Everyone has  Entered the program  Entered the studio  So the article goes  Don't be surprised  When WNAW  Exiles  Opie and Anthony  Pop up more and more  As June approaches  And they prepare  A return to the radio  There are no  Accidents in the  Promotion game  At which ONA  Accel  Also don't be surprised  If they sign  With Sirius satellite radio  Meaning fans  Would have to buy  A serious receiver  And pay $12.95 a month 
[01:41:30]  Opie and Anthony  Have been off the air  Since August 2002  When two listeners  Were arrested  For having sex  In the St. Pat's Cathedral  As part of  ONA Sex for Sam  Contest  NEW station manager  And program director  Were fired  And the station  Soon dumped  The whole hot talk  Format ONA  Had been anchoring  The two have  Always implied  That they wonder  What the big deal was  And they say so  Again in the new  FHM magazine  They also used  The interview  To reinforce their  Irreverence  Sniping at  WNAW's 
[01:42:00]  Parent company  Infinity  And complaining  Because Infinity  Has been keeping  Them off the air  Of course Infinity  Has also been  Paying them  Millions  But they have  Always painted  Themselves and  Their fans  As proudly  Rebellious targets  Of a disapproving  And humorless world  And they're not  About to abandon  That position  As for where  They will surface  In June  Three major factors  Suggest Sirius satellite radio  Three major factors  First satellite  Has no content rules  Yes  Second  Former NEW program director  Jeremy Coleman 
[01:42:30]  A big ONA supporter  Now works at Sirius  Ah well  Still works there  Another clue  Still supports us  Still loves us  By the way  Listens every day  I saw him on the street  Recently  He goes  I listen to you guys  Every day  You guys are sounding  Better than ever  Thank you Jeremy  Third  Sirius trails rival  XM and wants  Splashy high profile  Programming to close  The gap  100 channels is nice  But that's not what  Sells  Says Tom Taylor  Editor of the trade  Magazine inside radio  We've seen from cable TV  That what sells  Are specific things  People really want 
[01:43:00]  That they can't get  Anywhere else  Opie and Anthony  Would likely cost millions  Millions Opie  But if they brought  Sirius 20,000 new  Subscribers  A small fraction  Of their daily audience  When they were syndicated  Out of NAW  That alone would mean  3.1 million  A year in subscription revenue  Exclusive of advertising  Asked if Sirius  Would be interested  In ONA  Acknowledging that  They are still  Under contract  To infinity  Sirius vice president  Of programming  Jay Clark  Who's still over there 
[01:43:30]  By the way  Says and I quote  Yes  You never know  They're very talented guys  Thank you  Who are restricted  By the rules  In commercial radio  Thank you Jay  ONA would have  To make decisions too  They would have  A similar audience  They would have  A smaller audience  Also part of their  Shtick on NAW  Was getting around  Content rules  With winks  And code words  Sometimes graphic  Is less interesting  Than suggestive  You know  You could replace  Anthony  Opie and Anthony  With Howard Stern 
[01:44:00]  And that is an article  From a couple of weeks ago  I know  Like it's the same article  I know  But if it worked out  ONA could say  They were to satellite radio  What MTV was  To cable television  And it did  And we are  We are here first  Annoying  Oh isn't that  What MTV was  No  And that's about it  Hey see  We made it  There you go  Why does this mic  Smell like Lysol  Did you guys already  Have some whore in here 
[01:44:30]  No I think  The mics are all  Lysoled  First thing in the morning  Yeah  Infected  Very clean  Don't want to get sick  You know  Again  Bill Burr  How are you  Oh I'm fantastic  Yeah  Oh yeah  How you been  On the road  Yeah I was actually  I was down in Miami  Doing the South Beach  Comedy Festival  How was that  Fucking unbelievable  Nice broads down there  It was ridiculous  I think  I was actually  That's all you hear about  From guys in South Beach  Hey you ever been to South Beach  All the fucking girls  Down there huh

[01:45:30]  They don't even give you the time  They don't even give you a little  They don't give you nothing  They're all like super tall models  They're all models  Yeah  We were sitting in a restaurant  And these three girls came in  They all almost look like somebody  Like one almost looked like Serena  Like Crawford  Yeah  And they're standing there  And they had like a fucking  Like this bodyguard  Standing over there  So I'm like  Who are they?  Are they famous?  And they were just rich  Just rich  Yeah it's like everybody in here is rich  Except one guy with red hair

That's a hello  That's a how do you do it  Yeah I know right  My fault  He knows that  We're just pulling shit out of our ass today by the way Bill  Because the papers have really nothing to talk about  Yeah I noticed  Because when I came in here  You were reading your XM fucking contract  For like 20 minutes  Subsect  Paragraph B states  You know here's the problem man  Yeah your Lenny Bruce moment  It's paragraph 
[01:47:00]  Someone asked if St. Pat's didn't happen  Would you still be on satellite?  I believe we would be  Yes  You think?  Yep  Nice  Why what happened on St. Patrick's Day?  St. Pat's Cathedral  Oh the St. Pat's thing  I believe we  I wanted to ask that yesterday  I believe we would have  Taken this road yes  You think so?  I think so  You would have just left?  I think we would have gotten fired  No I don't know if we would have gone to satellite  You would have left free FM?  Unless we were fired  I don't know  David Lee Roth a huge disaster here in New York 
[01:47:30]  It's hard to tell  They have a great article in the Daily News  Or the Post today about him  And how he's just  They can't work with the guy  It's in Radioland  It's the sour grapes of Roth  Get it?  The grapes of Roth  They're always funny  He's an old school rocker  What do people like  You can't tell that dude  And he's a cool dude  You ever meet the motherfucker?  He's like  He's a cool guy  It just shows you  What's going on in commercial radio  They just don't get it  Of course this guy was going to be a problem 
[01:48:00]  Of course  Looks like rock star turned shock jock  David Lee Roth is having an ugly launch  As Howard Stern's successor  The radio station's staffer is grumbling  About Roth's alleged bad behavior  My sources at 92.3 Free FM  Formerly K-Rock  Tell me that former Van Halen frontman  And his manager  Matt Sencio  Is that his name?  Are quote  Totally out of control  And out of their league  When it comes to producing a radio show  As one disgruntled employee put it 
[01:48:30]  Quote  This guy Roth  Is impossible to work with  A real arrogant  Self-righteous ass  Says a lowdown spy  Quote  All the execs know  They made  The two biggest errors  In radio history  Letting Stern go to Sirius  And hiring this moron Roth  He never preps for a show  He is out the door  Five minutes after the show  Unless he is forced  To record a commercial  I thought we were talking about 
[01:49:00]  The David Lee Roth show  Is that David Lee Roth or Anthony?  He's forced to record a commercial  Or records ones he made errors on  According to the anti-Roth faction  He demanded that general manager  Tom Chiasano  Do expensive renovations  On Stern's old studio  Then refuse to use it  Claiming asbestos infestation  He ripped down the walls  Of the temporary studio  Because of suspected dust 
[01:49:30]  Behind the walls  He swears he's allergic  To dust and smoke  But smells like an ashtray  The source also says  Roth's manager  Got into a shouting match  With program director  Mark Chernoff  On one of the first few days  Of the show  Then the spy says  Roth insisted on decorating  The halls of the studio  And the studio  And then had  A moving company come in  And remove dozens of pictures  And his fake palm trees  While he mumbled about  Tom and the bastards  At infinity  Bozy bozy bop  City bop 
[01:50:00]  Roth said  In addition  Says the source  Roth  Quote  Hates Tom  And his vocal  Is vocal about it  To almost everybody  He talks to  Bozy bozy bop  City bop  Roth was quoted as saying  It's almost like  He wants to get fired  And take the money  And run  Bozy bozy bop  City bop  My detailed message  Went to various 
[01:50:30]  And sundry  Yesterday  The station declined  To comment on the whole thing  And what did Dave  Have to say about that  David Lee Roth  Had one last quote  Bozy bozy bop  City bop  You know what's funny  Is if he was getting  Great ratings  He could have done  All that shit  And they would have  Been in the paper  He's a dream to work with  He is such a professional  He just comes in  He's in a great move  The reviews were in  First one here  Last one to leave  Right  Hey we gotta back up  One reason he rocks here 
[01:51:00]  He has the most amazing  Catalog of radio stuff  I bring nothing to the table  But Steve brought this one in  But he just said  But I bring nothing to the table  But he just said  He brings nothing  Remember that article  We were reading about  All the stuff we did  To Howie  Uh huh  And one was the  High pitch Eric  Bomb threat  Yeah  We do have the audio still  We do  First skipped message  Hey Opie  What's up  One word of advice  You mother 
[01:51:30]  You suck  I hope you die  I'll put a bomb  In your radio station  You mother  You fucking punk  You fucking punk  You motherfucker  Pussy  I'm radio edit  You mother  No we had to  We played that on the air  And we had to use radio edit  Because we weren't allowed  To use Howie's name  Yeah he said  Howard Stern is better than you  Even though his people  Were threatening to kill us  With bombs and stuff  We weren't allowed to use Howie's name  Bomb the studio  We had to put in radio edit  When um  Anyway  When his name was mentioned  And then we would talk about him by saying 
[01:52:00]  So did you hear fucking radio edit  Was doing this or that or the other thing  And then Mel actually called us in for a meeting  To tell us we are not to refer to Stern as even radio edit  That became where people knew who we were talking about  So he got so angry  That he went to Mel  And Mel told us not to even  We couldn't even call him radio edit  That's how crazy it got  What a sick situation that was 
[01:52:30]  Did he finish the David Lee Roth story?  He had one more quote  He did?  Yeah  And the story ends just like that  Is this out of E-Rock's iPod?  Nothing  Nothing  My radio show blows  Everybody knows  No that's what the song is about  It is?  You don't even have to like make it up  I didn't know it was a parody  I was coming out there  I was going to say  Look at you already go to work  It was riffing  You were singing over an actual parody  That was already done

[01:56:30]  Some above comedians  Some  Yeah, some  I'm not talking dame  See, the company  The old company realized that  They thought they could move on without us  Yeah  And they've tried so many different things  At our old station  Now with K-Rock  They're going to call us again  Yep  There's no doubt in our minds  Look at the call  Because now they're desperate  Now they're like  Oh, we're ready to, you know, forgive  And forget  Well, look at it this way  We're not leaving XM, though  How about I rephrase it  Mm-hmm  Who would you endorse

[01:57:30]  To figure out  Who the fuck  They were going to put  At all of his stations  And you see who they came up with  It just goes to show you  There really isn't much out there  As far as pick and go  And that doesn't mean  There's no one with talent  Out there  It takes talent  And balls  And the  You have to be fearless  You have to be able to  Reach a point  Where you can tell your  Program director  To fuck off  You're doing the show  You want to do  Same thing with the GM 
[01:58:00]  And have some balls to you  Yeah  Sounds like he's doing that  But he doesn't have the ratings  Tearing shit off the wall  See, you need talent  To back that up too  Yeah  And you've got to put  A little bit of time in  More than just like a month  You've got to be there  Maybe three  Six months  He'll be out by spring  And then when you get  A following  This is the Boston  O&A plan  When you get the following  Then you do whatever you want  Whatever you want  Except sex in a church  By the way  That doesn't work 
[01:58:30]  I was going to say  The mayor died  You know, isn't it good to see  No, the mayor died  Helped us out  Yeah, that helped  We doubled our salaries  Doing that  That was good  It is nice  That was a good one  That was a great one for us  By the way  On a side note  With the sex for Sam thing  It is nice to see  Jim Cook actually being  Brought back into the fold  Of Sam Adams  He's on all their commercials now  Yeah  He had to go away for a few weeks  He had, oh, they put him in a closet  And shut that door  And locked it  Jim Cook  Hi, I'm Jim Cook  You remember me  I was involved with the  Opie and Anthony  Sex for Sam promotion 
[01:59:00]  Like, ah, put him in a closet  Yeah  And now they bring him back out  And he's selling his beer again  They're like  They got rid of him  And got some pilgrim  To the spots for a while  Yeah  Ah, yeah  Sam Adams  I felt so bad for that guy  You know something  You've got to dress up  Sam Adams  You can't even tell your family  You booked something on TV  Yeah, did you see me?  Sam Adams  I hold the pewter mug  And I, um  No?  Yeah  But it is  Because Jim Cook  Is a really good guy  He was always a friend of the show 
[01:59:30]  And it's good to see  That he's back with them  And I will bet money  That he will be back advertising  On the Opie and Anthony program  Would be nice  It's going to be  It's going to take a little more time  But you watch  By the way  That was David from New Jersey  Doing the David Lee Roth parody  He's a friend of Voss's  Is he?  Yeah  Wow  And he did a great job with that  David from New Jersey  Thank you  A friend of Voss  Did that belittle the talent now?  He's just going  Yeah  I'm kind of like

Hey, what's up, shit dicks?  Hey  Uh, quick question  Do you still have tape  Of that lunatic Anthony  Reciting Howard Stern's name  Over and over  Back when he owned N.E.W.?  Oh  Well, they would start  Dumping out every time  We mentioned his name  So then we're like  You know, this is bullshit  So we just said it  Over and over again  Until they ran out of delay  They ran out of delay  And then they had to  Turn our show off  And go to a Van Halen record  Yeah, coincidentally 
[02:00:30]  It was the Van Halen record  They used to have a box  With a key  And a button  In the general manager's office  It was a  An actual key  Like launching an ICBM  And when they ran out of delay  Which we had huge amounts of delay  And various buttons  All around the place  That could be hit by  Numerous people  To dump out of our show  When they ran out of the delay  And we were back actually live  If we said something bad  The key was turned  The button was pushed 
[02:01:00]  The station was completely detached  From its ability to broadcast  And a tape would play  From the Empire State Building  From the transmitter  Was it another motherfucker  With a key that he had to turn  Turn your key, sir  Now  Turn your key, sir  Gun at his head  Wait, think about this, man  Think about it  We have to take the human element  Out of the loop  The code doesn't match  The code 
[02:01:30]  And yeah  There was a tape  At the transmitter  At the Empire State Building  That would play  Jump  By Van Halen  That was the song, right?  It was Ain't Talking About Love  It was Ain't Talking About Love  Ain't Talking About Love  It was Jump  Yeah  Ain't Talking About Love  Would start playing  And we were off the air  We were off the air  So we actually got to the point  Where they had to go to this  Because we just kept reciting  Y'all can suck my  Oh, hey you  Hey, hey, hey  Woo

Oh, they were rewiring that  That joint on a weekly basis  But that was just because of Stern  Or even before that  They were getting miserable  It was when we started getting popular  And they were afraid of what we were doing  Because we weren't so far under the radar 
[02:02:30]  We used to be able to do shows that were about  I mean, we had a girl  Get down on  Completely naked  Sit on the floor  Right behind Opie  And smoke a cigarette with her pussy  She actually was inhaling through it  And blowing smoke rings through it  And to the best of our abilities  Adhering to FCC regulations  We described what was going on in the air  This, nowadays  Doesn't matter how you describe it  Doesn't matter what type of  Three degrees of separation

[02:11:30]  It's gonna be an open call this Friday  That was horrid  That was some of the worst  Egg shooting  That we've had  On this program  Since the beginning  I gotta tell you  This guy's name is brilliant  His name is 32 Across  Oh, very good  32 Across  You're brilliant  Thanks boys  How you doing?  What do you got for the show today?  You guys should explain to Patrice  About the Louis Anderson  Family feud bit  And that was the closest  That you guys  Didn't get kicked off the air  That was brilliant  Hmm  Yeah 
[02:12:00]  I don't know  Oh, I suck  Punch it up  No, that was it  No, that was good  We were just kind of pondering it  But now people are bringing up  All sorts of stuff  Yeah, it's not  You know what?  You go to OAVirus.com  You can hear like  Jackie the Knife Girl  Someone's mentioning  The Louis Anderson bit  I'm sure is up there  Go to OAVirus.com  For all the old material  Nothing was worse than him  On the  I think it was 60 minutes  Of one of those shows  Just talking about  This alcoholic  Abusive father  That, you know  I turned tragedy  Into comedy 
[02:12:30]  Yeah  Where's the comedy?  Where is it?  Where the hell is it?  Oh, here's tragedy  When he was sitting there  And then it ruined  Comics cannot open up  In a public forum  Like 60 Minutes or 20-20  Because it's all you think about  When you see him  Now, I never found  Louis Anderson that funny  You know  But when I see him now  All I think is  He would hit me  With whiskey bottles  And my enabling mother  Allowed me to gain  So much weight 
[02:13:00]  That the schoolyard children  Would beat me senseless  It was just horrid to watch  Turned me into  An introverted homosexual  All right, Louis  Where's the funny?  Dab your head with the rag  And say  I sweat  And if I didn't  I'd explode  I move the mic stand  And say  Let me move this out of the way  So you can see me  Do one of those  Fat gags  Help us out a little bit 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, do something  I don't want to hear  About your father  Smacking you  Until you bled  Then I was sexually assaulted  By an uncle  At eight  That might have led  To my eating disorder  Great stuff, Louis  He bent me over  A buffet table  Yeah, that  I don't know why  It gave me a love  For the buffet table  I think as I was  Taking it in the ass  I was looking at the table  Saying, save me 
[02:14:00]  Save me  At least there's something good  And there's something good  I was eating  Off of the roast beef slicing table  As he was doing it to me  So I could never get enough  Roast beef  High carb rate  You saw this coming  Chaos from Whackbag  What's up?  What's happening, guys? 
[02:14:30]  I was at my local Walmart  I happened to be walking over  By the electronics department  I see this ladder  Moving by itself  I look over the counter  Little bitty guy  Just happened to be carrying  And I started laughing my ass off  A little midget  Carrying a ladder  Did he work there?  Yeah  And he was going to  I guess use the ladder  To get something that was  Easily accessible  To a real human  Yep  Yeah  I thought it was hysterical  Nothing funnier 
[02:15:00]  Than a little midget  Moving something  Because it looks like  It's moving itself  For a while  And you freak out  And then you go  Oh, it's one of those  It's one of those  Meanwhile  Back at the show  So  Yeah, it's not  You know  Let's look back  Look  People bringing up  The Buffalo Road show  I know  We're trying to move on  The most offensive song contest  Which I don't know  How we ever got away with

That would be the first thing  And we were playing music  Or talking  We would say nothing  So we'd be like 
[02:16:00]  What are you trying to win?  You know  And the people would tell us  And we'd just kind of  Fuck with them  We'd kind of just  Riff a little bit  And illegally put them  On the air  You know  Things like that  Against all FCC regulations  Why not  So this lady  Called us  Thinking she won  Donna Summer tickets  We'll play this  Going into break  Bill Burr in studio  Playing the Stress Factory  Yeah  7-3-2-5-4-5  Ha-ha  All weekend long  Starting Thursday  Yeah  Thursday through Saturday  And Patrice O'Neill  In studio  Playing Helium Comedy Club

[02:17:00]  Yesterday  Right in the middle  Of live on the air  He fell asleep  Patrice gives me love  With my lines right  So yesterday  I had a line  And I was in the zone  I'm like the line  Is a good line  You just know sometimes  Right  So I'm feeling good  I do the line  And it's giving me nothing  Which is fine  I look over to Patrice  I'm like I know  He's going to give me  One of those big  Patrice O'Neill laughs  Right  And I look over  And here's Patrice  Just  She's going to take  This picture  No you're not  Because that's the one  They'll use  There's Patrice 
[02:17:30]  With his head back  Like this  Snoring away  I'm like  Damn  That's when he was  Doing this whole  Fucking  Patrice doesn't get up  Till like what  Two in the afternoon  Three  At least four  If I can help it  Yeah  Yeah  Lately  I've had jobs  It's all of you comics  Just  You sleep in late  It's a wonderful life  And then you  But we work till like  Two  I mean  Yeah but that's good  20 minutes of comedy  Then we hang out  Giving each other shit  Until two in the morning  But that's fun too 
[02:18:00]  Like I understand  As opposed to what  Fun too  As opposed to  As opposed to  Getting up  At an ungodly hour  Of the morning  What having naked girls  Coming in here  Shooting stuff  All right  Pussies  It could be worse  Free tickets to concerts  It could be worse  I understand  That saves the Metallica  I mean come on  I understand  But afternoons now  Now that was the lifestyle  I'm used to sleeping  Till I get up  Like until  Until my body goes  What the fuck  Get out of bed already  For no reason  That's what I like  But it's just like 
[02:18:30]  Can't get up  I don't like being told  When I have to get up  I don't know  Like an alarm going off  And then having to get up  I want to get up  When my body says  You want to take out  When you're  Get out of bed  Yeah  Every day  I get up at five o'clock  To get here  Like it's because  It takes me about  A half hour  To just take a shower  But every day  I get up  I sit on the side of the bed  And I go  I should just call  And say something to Ben  Just say  I can't make it  We're going to be late  Can you call somebody else  I can't  Help me please  I stagger into the bathroom 
[02:19:00]  Every morning  The light comes on  You hear your pupils slam shut  And you look in the mirror  Just oh I can't  I'm exhausted  I always wake up like mad  Because I always forget  That I'm doing radio  And I think for some reason  I put the alarm on for no reason  I woke up this morning doing that  And I go  What the fuck  No  No  Come on  What is this for  The furtherment of my career  And there's some truck driver driving  And he's cocks 
[02:19:30]  Like he gets up at three  And he has to drive to  Alabama  Saying things that aren't worth  And a truck driver has to know  Where to go  Because I drive  I drive sometimes  And there's so many places  Where it says  Get the truck driver  Stay the fuck over  Like they can't drive in the fast lane  They can't drive all parkways  They can't drive fast  They just can't do shit  And I'm complaining like  I gotta get up and try to be famous  Fuck  Yeah but you know what  Everybody who gets into entertainment  You get into it  Because you don't want a real fucking job 
[02:20:00]  That's why  You know  That's why you do it  I don't want a boss  Yeah  Well let's move on  I don't want to get up early either  Let's go to Chris on Long Island  Chris  Good morning ladies  What's up Chris  Hello Bill Burr  My little only MySpace friend  It's Chris from Livewire  Oh hey what's up man  Hey Patrice  I was watching Flavor Love the other day  And I don't know if you noticed this  Opie when you watched it  When they went to the commercial  For the preview for next week  Yeah 
[02:20:30]  And they showed  The lineup of the chicks  That were on the next week  So you already know who was eliminated  Oh they  They kind of blew it  Blew it  Yeah  The payoff is watching the whole fucking thing  For an hour  To see who gets eliminated  So they show the promo  And then they show who's left  So you know who's not going to get knocked out  Because you see them for the next week's promo  Exactly  Yeah that is kind of a blow it move  Yeah VH1 doesn't exactly have a score CZ over there  No  Alright  He kind of goes  Hey Patrice  Yeah 
[02:21:00]  Hey Patrice remember Opie  Hey Bill  Hey Patrice  I want you to talk to those guys over at VH1  And tell them to stop fucking up  Sure fucking people I don't know  I'm just an asshole in front of a green screen  With white people walking around  I don't know who the boss is  Yes boss  Yes boss  Somebody said flavor of love  Not to be a fizzle  Let's go to North Carolina  Bill what's up  Yeah I want to talk to Patrice about him cracking on Appalachian State 
[02:21:30]  And it's not Appalachian it's Appalachian  It don't matter  It just doesn't matter  It really doesn't matter  That's exactly it  That's the point  That's how obscure it is  No one knows how to say it  Appalachian State is hot hot hot  Does anyone care  What an awful school  That was part of Web Junk 20  Patrice O'Neill's new show on VH1  They do  They have one  Nice for the set up Bill  Because we're going to play some of our favorite clips from there  We got three quick ones  We got the Bush clip  We got the John Dacre clip  Doing awful versions of really good songs 
[02:22:00]  Not well really good old songs I guess  And then the Dr. Phil clip  Which is just classic  Yeah make sure you get a shot of Opie there  As Iraq is eating his cereal and mayonnaise  Get that  I hope you got a tight shot there  We got the Daily News in doing their little photo shoot  Yes  I think you ought to do something with a cool little depth of field  Where out of focus eating motherfucker isn't right there  But Opie's in focus  Out of focus cereal bowl and gorging idiot 
[02:22:30]  Yes  In the foreground  Too bad you weren't here earlier when he was sucking mayonnaise packages  Look at that  He just turned his hands up like  What did I do?  Yeah like he'll be eating a sandwich  And rather than put like the mayonnaise on the sandwich  He tears it open and just squeezes it in  You suck the 47 hand mayonnaise package?  He sucked the last bit of mayo out of the package  Out of the package  You know how many mayonnaise packages I touched  I found the right one? 
[02:23:00]  Alright  Second on it  Like space food  So from WebJunk20  Patrice O'Neill  VH1  Here's the Bush clip we were talking about earlier  Well it's explained within the clip here  Did you hear these rumours that President Bush is drinking again?  Have you heard this?  I mean it's frightening  I'm not sure it's true  It's probably not  But I'm telling you  Well look  Take a look at this  Stink  I'm thinking  I'd have stood up here a year ago  In one of my many press conferences 
[02:23:30]  And told you  That in the  Next year  I make this prediction to you  That over 10 million Iraqis  Including many Sunnis  Will vote for a permanent government  I think you probably will have said  Where he goes again 
[02:24:00]  That is brilliant  That's Craig Ferguson  Wow  On his show  Great observation  It's really cool with the video  Because the video kind of makes it work also  But the audio is great  It's just  That's actual audio  It's slowed down  They slowed it down slightly  To make him sound drawn  Slightly slowed it down  And it absolutely sounds like he's hammered  Yeah  Perfect  Why didn't we think of that?  Damn it  I hate the obvious ones  And then there's the John Dacre clip  That also was featured on WebJunk 20  This guy is just a complete tool 
[02:24:30]  He's scary to look at as well  When he's trying to sing these songs  My name is John Dacre  Lord is risen today  Hallelujah  That's what it sounds like, right? 
[02:25:00]  Once there was a girl  Who  When the moon hits you  I like a big pizza point  That's a moray  That's moray  That's moray 
[02:25:30]  Moray  Sing about the eel  Moray  Listen to the piano getting too mad  He's doing it any better  You should see the lady on the piano  She's not even paying  She's just grooming some  You know 
[02:26:00]  A large-march type of lady  From like Hicksville  And she just  If you notice  She's off beat  But she's just in the whole space  Like  He just sucks  And she's just like  What is she supposed to do?  Like  Keep up with this guy?  Why?  She's doing it right hand  With one arm  And  That is a clusterfuck  Awful  What is that from?  Moray  Well it was featured on WebJunk 20  That's the longer version of the clip  Yeah  That's the real version  Yeah where do you find him?  Like what is he?  Is that a podcast 
[02:26:30]  Or is it on a religious channel?  Or  Where does this guy come from?  Off iFilm  It's off iFilm  But  The dude  Is  It's a lady  It's public access  Like  Oh public access  Just  Wherever  Yeah  They make crazy  And everybody in the situation  John Dacre  Is not a weirdo  In this situation  You know what I'm saying?  And there's another girl  That's just awful  She's singing like  You know  Love is  It's just a lot of retards  Doing whatever they do  Fantastic  And  And  And it's just like 
[02:27:00]  Some public access thing  And  And it's run by the lady  Doing the piano  Yeah  Like she just put everybody together  Cause some preacher  Couldn't show up  But John Dacre was available  She's like  We have John Dacre  And she gives you the intro  Like  A bad college intro  Like  The worst intro ever  When you go to colleges  For a comic  Is when they have a fucking idiot  Who  Who introduces you by name first  Then reads your  Your thing  He's like  Who we have  Billy Burr is here  Billy Burr  Does Opie and Anthony  And he has an HBO special  Yeah  And here he is 
[02:27:30]  Coming to the stage  And here he is  Oh  Billy Burr  Smattering of applause  Again  It's supposed to be  Ladies and gentlemen  Billy Burr  They don't say  They don't say  They just say your name  At the beginning  And then they just read credit  It's gotta go at the end  And then he's  He's been on premium blend  And he did comics  Come home  Yeah  With Dennis Leary  And then they just  Walk away from the mic  And then people are like  Do we clap here  When do we  I always say that to him  I go I don't give a shit  What credit you say  Just say my name last  Last 
[02:28:00]  They don't get it  Patrice O'Neal  Is coming out now  He's  He's  Will be performing here  And he's been on HBO  That's horrible  They just walk  They just walk off  That is not a way  It's even bad enough  That they don't walk up  To the mic  And at least get the crowd  Like hey  Thanks for coming out tonight  Give yourself a round of applause  That hacky shit  To bring  They just go up there  And start talking  Half the time  And get some kind of  Energy going  Half the time  People are still talking  I don't care how little money  I get paid for colleges  Someone goes with me 
[02:28:30]  That takes the brunt  Of the pain  Because it's never good  Never  That's brutal  Alright we got one last clip  You always make sure  You have a buffer  I gotta do that  I bring somebody  That's a smart guy  He's a smart comedian  Of insulation  Yeah  Hey we got one more clip  From Web  Go ahead  One more clip  From WebJunk20  This is the Dr. Phil clip  That I found  Very very disturbing  And funny  At the same time  Where is he messed up  On this  They're talking about

[02:33:30]  You just put him  In your lunchbox  And carry him down  We threw him  In a Ziploc body bag  Did you just do a CS on him  Cause he wasn't big enough  For an eye  He just did a C  What did  What did the little fella die of  I have no idea  He was just laying on the bed  He was feeling low  He did call the hospital  With shortness of breath  All right guys  Watch it out  Oh  He had a little of this 
[02:34:00]  And a little of this  That's so funny  I'm trying to think of  Something low to the ground  That he bumped his head on  Oh  Shit  Meanwhile  Back at the show  Anyway  So that oral sex thing  Yeah  That's some clip  That's incredible  WebJunk 20  With Patrice O'Neill  And VH1  Check it out  Take a peek at that  You've been checking out  Any podcasts  You go to Apple.com  There's a few podcasts out there  I downloaded one  There's two guys 
[02:34:30]  That do kind of a tech show  Yeah  Thing  They're on a couch  With laptops  But they drink beer  The entire time  And I guess it's about  40 minutes long  And they progressively  Get more and more drunk  During the show  And one guy  You can tell  Can kind of hold his beer  The other guy  Completely can't  And the one guy  That can  Really is into  The tech end of things  So as the show goes on  He's trying to show him  Like this new technology  He goes  Here's a camcorder  That I got for Christmas  And my father 
[02:35:00]  Wound up getting the same one  And he's like  Do you think anyone cares  About your camcorder?  And they're both  They both get hammered  By the end of the show  Can we get some clips of this?  I thought that was pretty cool  Yeah I'll dig up some  I've been just  Trolling through a few of them  There's a lot of just boring crap  But you really want to start featuring  Some of the better podcasts  Video podcasts  Of what's going on  And it's video  So you see the guys  Yeah right on  On there  A lot of fun  Alright  There's not much in the news today  That's why we're kind of screwing up  There were a couple of interesting stories 
[02:35:30]  The Paul McCartney story  Really hit me  Listen to this  His wife  What's her name there?  Heather Mills  Now read this real fast  It's short  Wife to Sir Paul  It's short  So is the corpse  Pot or me  Yeah  Listen to this  Pot or me  Heather Mills said  She gave Sir Paul McCartney  A strict ultimatum  As their relationship blossomed  Quit smoking marijuana  Excuse me  Or forget walking down the aisle  Huh?  I told him I would not get married to him  If he was taking drugs 
[02:36:00]  I hate it  Heather 37  Told London's  Observer newspaper  I could not have him  Lying to our child  About not taking drugs  And then going out  For a sneaky puff  He says he had a good incentive  A good incentive  To stop smoking pot  Her ultimatum?  Yeah  You don't give a Beatle  An ultimatum  Excuse me  Yeah  You think John Lennon  Would have taken that?  No  He would have thrown her  Off the balcony  Yeah with the one leg  It's Paul McCartney  This is a chick with one leg  Giving them rules?  Yeah 
[02:36:30]  It's Paul McCartney  You know what  He obviously didn't sign a prenup  Because there's no way  To take that  She wouldn't even  Brought it up  This was before  They got married  She wanted him  To stop smoking pot  There is no way  Paul McCartney  Should be taking an ultimatum  From anybody  Especially a bitch  With one foot  The second wife  Not even the one he wanted  The one he wanted  And married died  She's like  The stand in  He really has just  Been pussy whipped  For like four fucking decades 
[02:37:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Someone needs to help that guy  He sat there  And let Linda  Sing on those songs  Where she is just  Making an abortion  Of a classic Beatles song  He's like  Love was just an open book  And I said  Live and let live  You know you did  You know you did  You know you did  Oh you fucking  She's playing keyboard  Did you ever hear the  Hey Jude?  With her in it?  Yeah this is the real  Oh my god  You never heard this? 
[02:37:30]  With her in it?  Dude  She had such a bad  Singing voice  That the engineers  Finally decided  To just isolate her mic  And hit record  This is real audio  From a Paul McCartney concert  Where she was singing  Background vocals  I guess they turned her  Down in the mix  But this guy said  This is way too good  I gotta share this  With others  So he taped  Just her microphone  As Hey Jude  Is being sung  I'm guessing  She was probably  Kind of cunty to the guy  And started actually  Thinking that she was  Actually a musician  And he was just like  Part of the band  Alright bitch 
[02:38:00]  Yeah  Oh I'm sure  She probably  You know  They knew she stunk  Can I get more bass  In my monitor please?  I don't think you're  Turning me up  I can't hear me  In the show  I just can't hear  What the fuck  I'm playing with  She's the one  Every time  Looking at the sound guy  Pointing at her ear  And putting her thumb up  Like more monitor  I can't hear me  Louder in the mix  You want louder  In the fucking mix  She holds the air phones  One over  One air phone over the air  To get the tone  And holds it 
[02:38:30]  Na na na na  Na na na  Hey Jude  This is the real deal  This is actually  Linda McCartney  You'll think this is a joke  This is so bad  This is the real deal  Listen to this  Na na na  Na na na

[02:45:30]  To make it a hit  That's how we're doing  Thank you dude  Are you taking  Paola  Opie  For this song  Because I haven't  Seen Dime One  You got an eight ball  You got an eight ball  Yeah  The record rep came in  Gave me an eight ball  And Opie's spinning  This like crazy  You know what's funny  About that shit  No one said anything  Even nine years  That exists on all levels  I remember  I got a new head shot  Like two years ago  And I go to give it  To my management  And I've been with them  For like three years  At that point  I give them the head shot  Like oh yeah yeah  It's great  It's great  Yeah your last one  Was awful  Thanks  I'm just like  Why didn't you bring that up 
[02:46:00]  No one brings shit up  And then they just  Start trashing my last  Patrice brings stuff up  That's who I've noticed  Patrice will bring something up  Patrice actually brings shit up  That doesn't even need  To be brought up  Right  Because you know what  Because it can't be fixed  It's just mean  And it's something  Like the size of my head  He has told me  About the size of my head  Like I can do something about it  How do you fix that?  Billy's head looks like  Easter Island  Why didn't you tell me  I'd have deflated it  And what kills me is  His head looks like  A fucking butcher block  And I'm actually 
[02:46:30]  Sitting here listening to him  Going like  Is it too big?  Do I need to work up?  He justifies the size of his head  Because of the size of his body  His body right  Alright well  I'll go eat some more cheesecake  Alright we got a place  She let herself go  And niggas hate me for that  And you talk about  Nine years ago  Nobody took  And you would hate me  If I go  Look Ope man  Your wife is a drunk  You don't deserve this dude  You need better  And you'd be like  Dude you out of your place  And you need to be hated  That's why no one says anything  You can't tell  You can't tell somebody 
[02:47:00]  Especially  Right before they're getting married  Or something  You go dude  You are making a big mistake  Because then what ends up happening  Is the person ends up  Mentioning it to the girl  And then you're phased out  Oh yeah  I'm sorry Ope  I know you get into this thing  But I just want to say  That is  That is a sign  Of your own  Non fucking understanding  Of your own life  Like if somebody said  My girl  Man your girl's a hoe  I'll go  And what's your point  I know that motherfucker  I'm not delusional  Bitch it's a hoe 
[02:47:30]  It's like your wife's a drunk  And you don't deserve  You know she don't deserve you  And you're like  Fuck you  Get out of my life  But you gotta accept  What is what it is  Yeah well  Yeah  Should've went  Yeah  No no one said anything  No one said anything  I just kind of sat around  No one does  Let's go to  Let's go to  She let herself go  I think when you  When everyone  When you walk in  And everyone just kind of  Stares off into the distance  Yeah yeah  That's usually like the thing  Like no one wants to say anything  To you  Just staring straight ahead  Like yeah  Yeah hey  Anthony and fucking 
[02:48:00]  Cunt I can't stand  When you hear like  When booze is being  Hidden like in  The animal house  When Dean Warmer  Walked in  And you hear  Clink clink clink  When she walks in  Yeah  You know she walks in  A house or room  Or a party  And people start  Hiding the jack  And the beers  Clink clink  Clink clink clink  What do we got  Club soda  You want some club soda  Get some high C  What kind of fucking party  Is just club soda  Let's get the fuck  Out of here 
[02:48:30]  Let's play  She let herself go  Alright  By 80 inch  It's one of these bits  That has taken over  And now I think  They're going to just  Start making country songs  Because what was the one  We suggested today  Oh damn it  The oil on the hands  Yeah  Oh washing it  Washing up before you go  Yeah  Sneaky shit  Something about the shower  Clean up  Straight to the shower  Straight to the shower  Straight to the shower  Is going to be the next  Country song we get  But she  Coming home and going  Straight to the shower  Just to let Bill know  Oh yeah 
[02:49:00]  We last week  We were listening to  The top ten country songs  In America  And they have silly titles  So we would see the title  Then we'd try to figure out  What the song was about  My hands might have smelt  Like a stranger's vagina  So there was a song  On the country charts  Called  She let herself go  Focus focus  I hope he's been trying  To get to this song  For 15 minutes  Focus  And Ellen just started  Dancing on TV  We get it  She's dancing 
[02:49:30]  We don't need to go there  Who gives a fuck  At this point  Her stupid dancing  So one of the country songs  Was she let herself go  So then we try to figure out  What the song was about  And it turns out  It's a song about a woman  Empowering herself  And doing something  About her life  And letting a bad situation go  And she's going to make  Something better of herself  But we thought  It was just the obvious  You know  She was hot  When it was hooked up  And in country fashion  She got fat  And he left  She let herself go  Yeah 
[02:50:00]  So then a guy  One of our listeners  80 inch  I think his name is  He came up with this song  Called  She let herself go  The real version  Would you shut the fuck up  There ain't no reason  For you to go to the store  And stay your fat ass  On the fucking couch  That's what you do  All day long anyway  And if I put you  On my damn truck  Then that motherfucker  Is going to take twice  The amount of gas  Just to go two miles  Down the goddamn road  Said I can't take it anymore  You better lay off the pad  All you do is stuff 
[02:50:30]  Your face  From morning to night  A traveling salesman  Out on the road  Only to come back home  To a heavier load  I've got to get this fat bitch  Out of my life  Cause she let herself go  Let herself go  No dying plant inside 
[02:51:00]  She keeps every goddamn thing inside  Let herself go  She leaves the toilet all shitty  No matter what she does  This bitch could never be pretty  That's all I can do  To keep her closed  She let herself go  Sounds like a real song  It really does  It's got the country feel  He's got a country voice  It's got that same country sound  That makes me want to kill myself  Right  It's perfect 
[02:51:30]  What is that guitar  Where you sit down  And you play that  That's the sound  I was trying to do  That's the country sound  Right there  Once you put a steel guitar  You can put a steel guitar  In a Metallica song  And all of a sudden  It's a country ass country song  Let's go to Ken in Jersey  He got one of those warnings  From one of his friends  Ken, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, Anthony  You're totally wrong  Most of the time  You think it's a joke  When you're about to get married  But your friends  Do give you a warning  They say  Are you sure you want to do this?  Are you sure you want to do this?  Yeah, but it's like  You're sure you're  Yeah, no  They laugh  But they're not kidding 
[02:52:00]  And let me tell you something  At the altar  It's too late  It's too late  It isn't  It's never too late  It is  You're going to be the guy?  You're going to make that scene?  It's a ballsy move  It's a ballsy move  It is a ballsy move  But to make a scene like that  Wow  I just remember  That's a rough one  I took this class in college  And a lawyer was teaching it  And he was bringing up  Just the nightmares  Of going through divorce  And he goes  I don't care  If you're standing at the altar  Never forget  He said that  He goes  Leave  He goes  You are going to cause 
[02:52:30]  Like so much less pain  Just walk  Yeah  Right then  Just take the embarrassment  It's going to be so much better  Than waiting  You know  Five, six years down the road  Having kids and all that shit  To fucking walk out  Absolutely right  All right  Let's go to Randy in New York  Randy  What's up guys  Hey  Going a little back before  Do you think Paul McCartney  Was using her leg as a bong at all?  Later  Oh smoking out of the pot  That's how this started  Maybe that's where the ultimatum was  To stop smoking out of my leg  Heather Mills is telling a beetle  Pot or me  How about me smoking pot 
[02:53:00]  Or you gimp your ass out of here  And try to find another beetle  Lottery  Who's been 90  Lottery  Yeah  Thank God  There's one left  Thank God Paul McCartney  And it's Ringo you idiot  If it wasn't for drugs  We wouldn't have had the second half  Of the beetle career  That's what I was going to say  Yeah  Sergeant Peppers  All that  Right  That was drugs  Yeah  It was drugs that did that  Thank God an earlier girlfriend  Didn't give the same ultimatum  We wouldn't have all that shit  That came out  You think that would  I want to hold your hand  Are serious  You think the beetles  Would have been  Like 
[02:53:30]  Wouldn't have gone down  In history as much  I want to hold your hand  I want to hold your hand  They would have sounded like  The Hanson brothers  Help me  Do you think you couldn't be wasted  And put  You don't want to hear that  Put those satin  Majorette fucking outfits on  Dude they sang a song  Called the yellow submarine  That's  That's  Somebody on drugs there  I think that's pre-drugs though  Isn't it  No  No  No  You can tell  There is a definite line  When they discover drugs  And it is so apparent  And now 
[02:54:00]  Someone is telling Paul McCartney  To lay off the pot  Yeah  He might still have  Some of this in him still  One little puff  And all of a sudden  A brain cell gets hit  And it's a brilliant song  Coming out  Remember me  Yeah  Smoke your pot there Paul  Smoke your pot  Jeez  She's bitching at him  Find another beetle  Go ahead  Go ahead  That's amazing  I wonder  Is he too pussy to go  Let's be honest here  You see this house  You see this house you're living in  That was because I was smoking pot  With my pals  Smoking pot  And doing a lot more

[02:55:00]  I can get  I bet you Paul McCartney  Could get a 21 year old  Dude  He bet you  You don't have to bet  This is not even  He could buy South Beach  Yeah  This isn't even an issue  That you have to say  I bet you  Right right  This is  He can  He's Paul McCartney  The Beatles  There's only two left  You just sit there right  When she's talking shit to you  You just shake your head back and forth  Like  And you just keep looking at her  Until she shuts up  And you just keep doing this 
[02:55:30]  You shake your head  Look at her eye  Then look at her foot  See  Once again  Patrice  Something she can't  The whole time she brought this shit up  He'd just be going  Back to the eyes  Which one is it again  Back to the eyes  Oh hold on a second  Then knowing it  And then knocking on the fake one  Um hello  I'm a Beatle  Bitch who fills your closet  With left shoes  Paul McCartney  Paul McCartney  And that's when you
