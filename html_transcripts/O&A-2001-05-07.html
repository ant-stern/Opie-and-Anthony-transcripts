<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a chaotic bit mocking a Bellevue Hospital patient from an HBO documentary who repeatedly exclaimed, "I hate this place. Nothing works here. The medications don't work. I've been here for seven years." This became a running gag.  The hosts dissected the documentary, focusing on eccentric patients like "Cheryl" (with constantly broken glasses) and a self-proclaimed God.  Callers reacted, many finding the documentary hilarious.  A listener contest, the "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest," was ongoing, with voting encouraged.  Graphic descriptions of patient behavior, including masturbation, were aired, along with audio clips from the documentary. A former psychiatric technician called in, sharing similar experiences.  The show culminated in a live phone interview with the documentary's "God."

Next, a guest named Greg, who identified himself as Jesus Christ and God, joined the show.  He recounted a cocaine-fueled attempt to break into Ronald Reagan's house in 1990 for publicity. Greg discussed his chaotic website and his plans for a unified global electrical grid to lower birth rates. The hosts repeatedly tried to get him to perform miracles.  The conversation then shifted to movie reviews, mainly *The Mummy Returns*, with criticism of its plot and child actor, alongside mentions of *Pitch Black*, *Memento*, *Pearl Harbor*, *Jurassic Park 3*, *Fast and the Furious*, and *Tomb Raider*.  The Robert Blake murder case was also discussed at length.

The show continued with the on-air firing of Jesse, a summer intern recently given a paid position.  His tardiness to a major WNEW event, explained away by a power outage, a broken cell phone charger, and a missing train, led to his dismissal.  Opie, Anthony, Earl (in studio), and Ben (off-air) participated in the heated, comedic firing.  The conversation then moved to listener calls discussing the firing, the changing standards of Bugs Bunny cartoons (specifically the removal of offensive content), a caller's boyfriend's deployment to Kosovo, and ensuing insensitive speculation. A Radiohead listening party contest was also announced.

A final segment heavily promoted a vote, repeatedly urging listeners to visit WNEW.com and FoundryMusic.com to participate, emphasizing the word "vote" numerous times.

The show concluded with plans for a "WOW sticker" distribution event across New Jersey and New York City, mentioning Frank Caliendo's earlier appearance, and further listener calls discussing the movie reviews and the Robert Blake case, along with continued promotion of Optimum Online and the "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest."

I've been here for seven years.  Now we're having fun.  Well, hello, everyone. 
[00:05:30]  This is the twisted and demented radio show called Opie and Anthony.  I'm sorry, man.  Funniest thing I've ever seen.  Unbelievable.  I hope you caught it after the Sopranos.  We warned everyone.  We said watch the Bellevue special right after the Sopranos.  Yeah, there was no reason to turn away from HBO last night.  After the Sopranos.  The special on Bellevue. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  They could put that on every effing week.  I would watch it right after the Sopranos.  Every week, different people.  Screw Survivor.  I was telling everyone in the back office we should do real-world Bellevue.  Real-world Bellevue.  Yeah, you start getting to know some of the people.  Un-effing believable.  Nothing works here.  I hate this.  I hate this place.  I've been here seven years.  Seven years. 
[00:06:30]  Hey, Rick, you got the crazy lady, too?  The crazy lady.  You got Cheryl?  The one with the glasses.  You got clips of her?  I got Cheryl.  She's out.  Well, this special was great.  They went through a few people.  I don't know.  Half dozen, dozen people, I guess, maybe.  And, uh, at Bellevue.  And there was that guy.  I hate this place.  He would just yell that around the halls.  Wouldn't shut up.  And then he'd just stop out of nowhere and kind of look around like, what the eff was I just doing?  Looks at his watch like, okay, I'm done.  Yeah, I'm done for now. 
[00:07:00]  He does that, what, for 40 minutes every single day of his life?  Every day.  Every day.  We got to go right to the phones, because everyone picked up on this.  That's why we started the show with a, yeah, I hate this place, guy.  Dave, what's up?  Oh, guys, that was probably one of the funniest America undercovers they've done.  Oh, without a doubt.  And you know what?  They purposely put these people on TV for us to laugh.  I got a strange feeling.  In about a few weeks, you guys are going to be walking around the place going, we've been here for three years.  Three years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place. 
[00:07:30]  Earl doesn't work here.  We hate this place.  You know what?  We went out for lunch today, and we're walking, and we walked about four or five blocks,  and the whole time, there was like five of us.  We're just, all of us.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  Nothing works here.  The medication doesn't work.  You know what?  A ton of people went into work today seeing the exact same thing.  The looks we got on the street were priceless, because obviously a lot of people didn't  see the special last night.  But one guy would start.  It's a great new game.  Do it.  I hate this place.  I'm always just playing. 
[00:08:00]  Yes, I am God.  I would like to go to court.  Yeah.  Tell people, I am God.  Yeah.  I hate this place.  Oh, man.  How are they going to top that one?  I don't know.  There's no way they can top that.  Nothing works here.  It's going to be tough.  All right.  The medication doesn't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  All right, Dave.  Whatever.  Bye.  He rocked.  That guy was the star of the show last night.  Well, him and, of course, the girl, Cheryl.  Yeah, we're going to get to Cheryl in a minute.  The sad part about that guy, he knows exactly what he's doing. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  No doubt about it.  All of a sudden, there's something in his head, and he's got to start saying this crap over  and over again.  Yeah.  And he starts saying it, and he knew exactly where he had to go.  He had to go back into the seclusion room.  Back into the room.  He knew the drill.  All right, I've got to take my glasses off.  You're going to close the door, and I'm going to be in here until I stop.  He was saying that as they were giving him the medication.  Right.  And he downs it, and then just keeps going.  Nothing worries.  Hair.  Hair.  I hate this place.  Zach, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Doné?  Hey. 
[00:09:00]  Did you see the lady that said, oh, yeah, she owns Microsoft Computers and all that other  stuff?  Yeah, she owns a computer company, she said.  She didn't even know what she was talking about.  They wheeled her in.  She was so incoherent, and, yeah, her talking was confused.  They were saying it.  And then they just know what drugs to give her.  Yeah.  All right, we'll give her this, this, this, and I don't want to calm her down enough to  where we can figure it out.  And she was like, oh, yeah, you better let me out, because my computer will just blow  up everything and stuff.  You better watch out.  Yeah, my computer, she's like the boss of a company, and no one's going to get paid if 
[00:09:30]  I'm in here.  And all of a sudden, they just go, okay, give her some Paxil, some Klonopin.  Yeah.  Give her that.  Close that.  That'll hook her up until we can talk to her.  And then they show her a few days later, I guess, or a week later, in her room, and  she's like, well, yeah, these drugs have certain side effects.  All right, all right.  And you can understand what she was saying.  All right, you let her own it.  All right, Zach.  Let's go to Jared, who's next on WNEW.  Jared, what's up?  Oh, WNEW, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yo, I think after that little opening, I'm going to check myself into Bellevue.  I'm not sure.  Jesus.  Well, we had a pound at home, just like they did on the show last night. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, it isn't effective unless you do it so many times, and people are like, oh, my  God.  Because they're interviewing other patients at Bellevue, and you can still hear the guy in  the background.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  I've been here for seven years.  All right, I'm going to throw this out there.  I was the only one looking at that woman's show and going, holy ass Bubba Ray Dudley has checked  and started to sell you out for those.  Bubba Ray Dudley, the chick with the taped-up glasses.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  Oh, my God.  And then they give her a brand-new set of glasses, and she effed those up as well. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, those are taped up.  They never really explain why she kept messing up her glasses.  She probably throws them down or something.  It throws them at people.  She's a nut.  She looks like Dr. Melfi from The Sopranos.  She sounded like her.  A little bit, right.  After The Sopranos, I didn't think you'd get much better last night.  That was a good episode.  I couldn't watch her before they gave her her new glasses with the chocolate in her mouth.  Stinky goes, oh, my God, it looks like she was eating squid ink. 
[00:11:00]  She's talking, and all the, like, strings of spit and chocolate in her teeth.  Yeah, yeah.  It's disgusting.  And then what does Opie do?  He runs up to the TV in the office and starts making out with her on the TV screen.  It's disgusting.  It looked like blood or something dripping.  It was just...  She had a chocolate bar in front of her.  It was chocolate.  And then they put the new glasses on.  It goes, oh, you're so beautiful.  You know, they're crazy.  You don't have to lie to them.  You know what?  I think the people that work in Bellevue are just this close to being a psychotic themselves. 
[00:11:30]  And then when that other chick, the one that loved her daddy that died, oh, my God.  She, uh, she's standing there with the fat woman, Cheryl.  And, um, Cheryl starts accusing the doctor of, uh, having a thing for the other girl.  Yeah.  You want to seduce her, or you...  She's all jealous.  Well, nothing wrong with hot mental patients.  You gotta love that. 
[00:12:00]  She'd be an easy score, huh?  I think we got...  Boy, there's a vulnerable chick.  We got some audio from her, I believe.  I can't make up.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I don't want to make up.  Oh, this is the girl that looks like, uh, uh...  Bubba Ray Dudley.  Bubba Ray Dudley with the taped-up glasses.  She got in a confrontation with the hot mental patient, Cheryl.  And, uh, I guess they wanted them to make up and hug and stuff.  I can't make up.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I don't want to make up with her because she got me into trouble.  You're a forgiving person.  Not when I'm tied down and thrown in the skin and I get in. 
[00:12:30]  And I'm seducing my camera.  That was a long time ago, and we're going to have to forget about that and work on now.  And you think she's so pretty that you want to seduce her, don't you?  No, I don't.  Because I feel like you have the hots for her and everything.  I don't have the hots for anybody.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, Jesus.  Ew, the hots for her.  Because she was that chick.  She was, uh, you know, for a mental patient and for what was going on in there, she was all right looking. 
[00:13:00]  You know, a little weird when she took her leather jacket off and started dancing around to daddy's home to stay.  The girl obviously has some problems.  They said ever since she was 17.  And then she's talking about her father.  She pulls this picture out and goes, he had a heart attack in front of me.  And I didn't know what that was.  And I didn't know CPR.  He died in front of me.  And then daddy's home is playing in the background.  And she's dancing with herself in this room looking up going, I love you, daddy. 
[00:13:30]  It was so awful.  I openly laughed.  Oh.  She had no bra on it, which made it a little special till.  Yeah, she's got like nips, but she's a little saggy.  And she's a little dumpy in the ass and stuff.  But as far as coots go?  Yeah.  And she was dancing to Shaft for a while.  Yeah, beforehand she was dancing to Shaft.  And then, daddy's home.  I love you, daddy.  Still. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, what's up, Bowenette?  I think he's laughing so hard he had to leave the phone.  What's up, still?  Horrible.  What's up?  I'm watching the promo before it starts.  Yeah.  And that chick is like, she's like, don't laugh at retarded people or whatever.  No, no.  Don't laugh at, yeah, mental illness or whatever.  Dude, I was rolling on the floor.  My girlfriend turned over to me.  She's like, you are a sick F.  How could you not laugh at that?  I know.  It was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I know it's tragic and all, but how can you not laugh at that? 
[00:14:30]  She's got the twisted glasses all taped off.  She's got like the squid ink dripping out of her mouth.  The squid ink.  She's telling us not to laugh at her.  All right, Stu.  All right, later, guys.  People who suffer mental illness are suffering from pain.  And it's nothing to laugh at.  And it's not funny.  Oh, my God.  But they put that clip there because it was funny. 
[00:15:00]  She looked like a, well, she is a nut.  And even the nuts have the pecking order.  Yeah.  Like, she's online.  She's losing her effing ass.  She's just like, ah, freaking out.  All the other nuts waiting in the food line think she's a nut.  Yeah.  And they're putting their fingers up like antennas behind her head.  Then they just start singing happy birthday for no apparent reason.  How cool is it that nuts realize that someone else is nuttier?  Is nuttier.  Like there's a pecking order.  I love it.  And then they all go in for food.  And the one black guy that was online, he walks in and goes, we getting pizza. 
[00:15:30]  And, like, makes his gang sign.  It felt like he's the tough guy in there.  What's this clip?  This is the opening clip.  We are getting pizza.  We are getting pizza, which we never get, hardly ever.  All we get is mashed potatoes.  Mashed potatoes.  You like that?  You don't get gold, sir.  This isn't a diner.  Come on. 
[00:16:00]  Come on.  Oh, my God.  James, what's going on?  Hey, Owen, what's going on?  Hey.  You know, if you didn't watch that show last night, it sounded like Opie losing his F.  Right.  When he goes, like, nothing works here.  Yeah, we're going to play that clip for the next year.  I wasn't watching the TV last night.  I was listening to it.  And all of a sudden, I was like, it's like, Opie's on?  It's true, though.  Nothing works here.  We've been here for three years.  Tim's got a good question on seven.  The medication doesn't work. 
[00:16:30]  Tim, what's up?  Hey, Owen, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  What is this guy?  Incrementing or what?  Did he start at one and work his way up?  Or did he just hit it right that it was a seven?  They don't know why he says seven years.  Yeah, but he's been there seven years, right?  No, it's seven years.  Like when he started, did he go, I've been here one year.  Nothing works here.  Yo, syndication when he hit 70.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Years.  Fast forward 20 years.  Ant and I at WNW. 
[00:17:00]  We've been here for 20 years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Oh, that guy had a good question.  He hung up.  Oh, well.  I want to hear more of the Cheryl clip.  We got more Cheryl.  Cheryl number two is pretty funny, too.  Cheryl?  What is she doing in this clip?  I think this is when she's trying to talk, and then she loses it, and they start singing  to her.  This is not for kids.  This is for the help of everything, but we're trying to say... 
[00:17:30]  How could you not laugh at that guy?  I know.  He's walking down the hall.  They got the camera on him.  He's building up in him, and he just starts blurting it out.  Come on.  At least we had the balls to admit on the air that we openly let it.  It was amazing.  Amazing.  Another thing that I wanted to touch on was the guy who kept repeating himself, this  guy was on literally 12 different type of medications, and every time they gave him  one, he seemed like it didn't faze him.  Right.  It's just normal, normal, normal stuff. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  All right, guys.  I just wanted to pass that comment about the masturbator.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah.  Scott, also online, too, has something to say about the masturbator guy.  Scott?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  They dump out of the J-O word these days.  All right.  How do you pull your plug?  And you can't even say the M word.  Don't say it.  Look, look.  Dude, dude.  Just say, crank it.  How do you pull your crank?  Right.  For six hours a day? 
[00:18:30]  And did he explain that he's doing six hours straight?  Did he, like, take a break and go to work and come home for lunch and do it?  He'd just go six hours at a clip.  No, he lost his job or whatever.  Had to make a leave of absence.  He was doing it for six straight hours.  He'd sit in front of the computer and just pull it.  I thought they showed him pulling it while he was in the hospital, too.  But they didn't even show that.  But the thing is, let me tell you, at his age and that whole thing going on, you know,  you got to work, you can't just do that. 
[00:19:00]  But I remember being, like, you know, 13.  You'd just crank it forever.  You finish, you start back up again.  That's the best thing ever.  That's because you can reload pretty quickly.  Yeah.  But, I mean, this guy's sitting in front of his computer.  And then he, did you hear that thing that was said also?  He noticed, or he didn't know he was being observed.  Like, he must have been by an open window doing this.  Or his wife.  Or, well, I don't know.  The way he said being observed, it sounded worse than if it was just his wife. 
[00:19:30]  He was throwing his web everywhere.  Throwing web.  He was throwing that web all over his room.  But, I mean, how you just sit there, you know, six hours in front of the computer.  I'm going to blow off work today.  She's going to sit here and crank it for a while.  I'm going to toss another web.  Here it comes.  And then what about when he's rubbing the shoulder of the other psychotic lady?  Oh, it's talking.  That the CIA is beaming into her head. 
[00:20:00]  And she's got to keep moving around so they can't get a fix on her.  Yeah.  It always throws them off.  Everyone knows you need the tinfoil hat to combat the CIA's radiation.  A vanilla envelope.  Eddie.  Eddie, hey.  How you doing, guys?  Don't I?  Live in law, live in law, live in law.  Live in law.  Listen, you guys got to do a better job of describing for those who didn't see what you're talking about.  This may have been the greatest comedy show in the history of the world.  But you've got to set up the premise.  There's a lot of people out there who didn't see the show.  Like what? 
[00:20:30]  Go.  Like, the whole premise was HBO didn't approach it from comedy like you guys were talking about.  They set it up as a whole medical, you know, like a review of the Bellevue situation.  No, no, no.  HBO, I think they knew exactly what they were doing.  Of course they did.  They had a lot of other people in Bellevue they could have focused on now.  We're packing up.  And Swiss cheese, rack around once, twice, and a big Coke. 
[00:21:00]  I've been in a few of these places, so.  Oh, yeah?  I think I could openly laugh at this crap.  But have you lived there?  No, not for me personally.  He was there for seven years.  Not for me personally.  They seem nice.  They seem like, you know, you get a nice room.  You get to walk around in your PJs the whole day.  And you're on drugs.  That sounds cool.  And there's even...  A person like a sailor. 
[00:21:30]  And then they get her a couple of days after being in a detox.  And she's like, well, I did a drink a lot.  And I want to go home.  Well, didn't you see the drawing, the latest drawing of Christ?  No.  I think Christ had some color.  I saw the pictures of Christ.  They look like nude women with whipped cream on them.  As per the way Rick is posing.  People are like that.  It's because of people like you who don't understand them. 
[00:22:00]  Look.  Hey.  Twat.  They own me.  Twat.  They're not like that because of people like us that don't understand them.  They're lunatics.  I hope you two dumbasses end up in a mental hospital.  We could.  And maybe then you'll understand.  No, we won't because we'll be crazy.  But believe me.  After three years at NEW...  I've been here for seven years.  Three years.  Three years.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place. 
[00:22:30]  I've been here for seven years.  That guy was a star last night.  Brian.  All right.  We got some psych ward people.  Ron says, I have to wait 30 minutes to go back in the pool.  Because you ate something?  Yeah, but that was an hour and a half ago.  Then why do you have to wait?  I had an accident on the diving board and there's stuff cleaning it.  You f***ing pig, you ruin another summer.  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to three.  1027. 
[00:23:00]  WNEW.  Shocking, dude.  These people, you know, they're born this week.  And sometimes, you know, they go through something in their life and it changes them forever.  And they can't help that.  You don't understand that?  I understand all that.  But funny is funny, too.  Funny is funny.  I mean, come on.  I mean, you guys are being ridiculous right now.  It's unbelievable.  No?  No.  No good arguments.  No.  I could say a lot.  Some people are sensitive.  Some are not. 
[00:23:30]  I've been in those places.  I've seen a lot of those people very close up.  You haven't lived until you, like, did arts and crafts with someone you really love.  Oh.  And made some really stupid thing that you probably made in kindergarten class.  All right, man.  You know, again.  Is that when you were visiting Ken Stevens, our GM?  I remember that.  We made baskets.  And I went.  I'm just saying, guys.  You two.  I'll speak later.  There you go.  I'll answer, Jeff.  But when I was watching last night, I'm like, without a doubt, this is going to make a great  little segment for the radio show.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Definitely.  Of course.  It's right up our alley.  Nuts.  I think I would look at it differently if I knew the people.  Of course.  You know.  But maybe we could have some guests on our show.  We'll get to know them.  That's the famous.  I mean, that Homer line says it all.  It is so true.  It's funny because I don't know them.  Right.  It's funny.  Yeah.  There you go.  And the people that are really pissed at these places.  I understand that.  I can relate to that, man.  There you go. 
[00:24:30]  Vermont Teddy Bear, Anthony.  Absolutely.  Mother's Day is coming this Sunday.  Send one to the institution.  Why not?  Mother's Day, yes.  Sunday, May 13th.  Make Mom happy with a gift from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  It's fun and original.  It's a great way to let Mom know she's loved and appreciated.  I've celebrated many holidays in institutions.  Nice.  Yeah, it rocks.  Your mom, wife, grandmother, they'll receive a beautiful bear handcrafted in Vermont personalized  just for her with a card and candy all delivered in a colorful gift box. 
[00:25:00]  Just call a bear counselor, 1-800-829-BEAR.  Choose from over 100 bears like the do-it-all mom.  Mama's boy bear with a heart-shaped mom tattoo on the arm.  There's even a pregnancy bear tailored your bear to your mom's occupation or hobby.  We have the nurse bear, doctor bear, teacher bear, and gardening bear.  A bear gram is a creative alternative to the usual gifts.  Sending it to the office makes it even more special.  And dads, don't forget to get something for me.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, B and Anthony.  What's your life, baby?  1-0-2-7. 
[00:25:30]  A little piece of it, that's all.  And that's, like, the best part.  Yes.  The filet cut.  You get it without all the fat.  Yeah.  Anthony, we really got to move on.  We were talking about the HBO special about Bellevue.  Yeah.  We'll get back into that maybe a little later, but there's so much else to talk about today, obviously.  A lot went on over the weekend.  Yeah, the Knicks are out of it.  Oh.  It's tragic, Mikey.  Oh.  Don't worry, we won't spend 12 straight hours talking about it. 
[00:26:00]  I don't know what we're going to do now.  I was hoping on the Knicks being in the playoffs for a little longer.  Now, how the hell are they going to compete, Mikey?  I hate this play.  Yeah, the Knicks went down.  No real surprise to real Knicks fans.  Yeah.  But it still sucks.  Got a bum in.  They're going to have to retool the whole team in the offseason. 
[00:26:30]  Tool.  Yeah.  But, Anthony, just to wrap up the Knicks season.  Yeah.  We have audio of Jeff Van Gundy at the press conference right now.  So here's Jeff Van Gundy after the game Friday.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:27:00]  Surprisingly, no one could ask him a question.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  I hate this place.  I don't leave little patches of hair.  There you go.  Anthony, big news here.  Yeah.  We've been doing the whipped cream bikini contest for the last couple of weeks.  We've had the ladies qualifying.  I want to thank all the ladies for coming down.  Unfortunately, we couldn't have all the girls in the finals.  It was a tough decision.  We had, God, how many people we have checking out the pictures? 
[00:27:30]  There was quite a few.  Twenty or thirty guys were, you know, around the computer, say, in our office, you know, picking the finalists.  And now it's time for you guys to vote for your favorite whipped cream bikini chick.  Yeah.  Now, here's the deal.  If you guys are relatively new listeners to our show, when we do these type of contests, we do it in a different way where we need you guys to vote every single day.  Every day, people.  Every day.  And what's going to happen, as the days go by, the girls with the least amount of votes will be knocked out of the competition. 
[00:28:00]  Eliminate.  So by the end of the week, we'll be down to two or three girls that you'll be voting on, okay?  Right now, what do we got?  Three, six, nine, twelve, thirteen?  Yeah, we won.  We won at the, you know, the top ten, but it was tough.  So we decided, you know what, we might as well just put thirteen girls up there.  Yep.  And their names, Anthony, for the people that aren't close to their computer right now?  In absolutely no particular order.  Right.  They are, Daisy made it in. 
[00:28:30]  Liz.  Chris.  Remember, Emelisa.  Emelisa.  Laura.  Laura, yes.  Charlie, the tall, strawberry blonde model girl.  Mm-hmm.  Teen.  Teen.  Teen.  Our only teenager, I believe.  Darian.  Darian, who's that B-movie softcore actress.  A favorite with the crowd, Kelly.  Yes.  Savannah.  Correct.  Jessie.  Jessie, who is now 20.  She's one of the Voyer Bus girls.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  That got arrested for us.  Mm-hmm.  Then you have, what, Dallas?  With the cowboy hat.  Yeah.  Celia.  Right.  And finally, Madison.  Madison from Privilege Gentleman's Club.  Yes.  There are your finalists.  You know what?  It's so, it's interesting because a lot of people have abused us over this contest.  Uh-huh.  They've trashed us and said, what's wrong?  You guys can't get the hot-looking girls into that studio.  Mm-hmm.  You look at those finalists and I think you're going to change your mind.  Yep.  There are 13 smoking girls right there.  There you go. 
[00:29:30]  You have to vote for your favorite.  We have a trip to Hawaii that we're going to give away to the girl with the most votes.  But it's very important that you vote every single day.  And those ladies that came down and were eliminated were not finalists.  It was very close trying to decide.  As a matter of fact, that's why we picked 13.  Right.  We couldn't just narrow it down to 10.  And then it got to the point where, look, now we've got to draw the line somewhere.  There was probably three or four more girls that we could have put up there.  But we had to cut it off. 
[00:30:00]  And I'm not talking about a Stalker Patty or a Mendy.  No, no, no, no, no.  And the Ringers are out of the contest, by the way.  Right.  Gloria Ann's out of the contest.  That, uh, Nikki Sterling's out of the contest, the porn star.  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  The Survivor's out of the contest.  Because they can't win the prize.  Those are like celebrity things.  Right.  So please vote at www.wnaw.com or foundrymusic.com, okay?  All right.  Uh, this guy outraged that Stalker Patty didn't make the finals. 
[00:30:30]  What?  Tony!  Hey!  What's going on?  Arby, you're letting me down.  I can't believe Stalker Patty's not in there.  Yeah, what a surprise.  She almost made it.  Uh, I don't know who I'm going to vote for now.  All right.  Thanks, Tony.  Carlos, uh, checking in.  Instant feedback.  Loves.  Melissa, what happened to Mendy?  Mendy, like, sent out a bulk email to all her fans.  To vote for her?  To vote for her and rigged the contest. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, stop.  You're like, you're going to make it through the...  See, that's why we do the, uh, first screening.  And we put the finalists in, so there's no goof factor.  No, we put the real finalists in, and then it's up to, uh, the listeners to take it from there.  That's it.  But I went to, um, went to a party Saturday night.  The message board had this, uh, big party in Jersey.  Had a great time.  Uh, a lot of people there.  And walk off the stage.  Now, I'm on the stage.  She ruined it.  Mendy's on the stage.  She ruined it.  Everyone's screaming, you ruined it. 
[00:31:30]  You ruined it.  She got lambasted.  And Patty came up on stage, too, and, uh, showed her, uh, her hooters, if you want to call them that.  I don't even know what you want to call them.  And, uh, the crowd, again, very, very disappointed.  Patty's got to stop.  She's got to stop.  Yeah.  Patty's out of control.  Patty.  Dude, what is happening?  Now she's doing this out in public?  Oh, yeah.  Now she's, uh, she's wowing the crowd.  She's got to stop.  Yeah.  Really.  Or we're going to have to get her in Bellevue.

[00:55:30]  you bring it into reagan's place okay it was a night um it was july 4th of 1990 i had had been up  all night having a party um it was actually in the house of the hotel california doing a little cocaine  uh a lot of cocaine yeah it was a lot of crap god loves his coke opie the crack was good but uh the  problem was i took the first piece of crack i was looking at a small crack out yeah and i took the first  piece of crack from my roommate he got mad and we got into a fight right so we were like fighting about 
[00:56:00]  it and carrying on and i said before i kill him let me do something worthwhile and i went down  and i got myself checked out of the hospital yeah and said that i was going to kill reagan  and they said well if you do what let's find a court of law that you were saying it's the time of the  crime so then i was like i pleaded with them i said please admit me please admit me please admit me  and the guy gave me two dollars and said um you know take care go buy a hamburger i was broke how'd you  get into reagan's house the door was open i uh i had chased out the joint one time before that 
[00:56:30]  and um so then uh you know uh well i didn't see any security who left you just walked in toronto  reagan's house well the door was wide open you know that's what you didn't lock the door so when  i called it when i ran up the side fence some defense and ran up the driveway an agent was following  up the driveway i ran uh to the door and i stopped and i said um this is as far as i said to get  because i read two and a few leary's books said the best way to get publicity is to commit a famous 
[00:57:00]  crime to go through the trial you know like oj the oj trial and stuff like that so you get all that  publicity from the trial and then you get the folks that the book deals after the trial's over hey god  yeah you know everything because you're god did oj do that did he kill us let me tell you oj knows  right for sure yeah but you're god you know oj's god too we're all one we are one believe it read the  books it's all right oj's god too we're all god we are one everyone is god but god i thought you were  the god no i am the christ oh there's only one christ oh you're christ are you the second coming 
[00:57:30]  of christ yes i am look at that i'm god and it's actually if you will say they don't believe it  maybe i'm the exception that proves the rule maybe i'm the rule that proves the exception  oh god god god on the hbo special last night that they said because of this whole reagan  thing that the secret service kind of keeps tabs on you and stuff yeah yeah and they take you to  movies and nightclubs well they differ when a president is close to you they did for a while  to this guy in the shacket god stop cursing yeah i'll be good um so so god no you're you're jesus 
[00:58:00]  right i'm jesus you are all god you i'm jesus we're all god but why not jesus see according to  to jesus in the bible i'm supposed to use my own name so my name is greg jesus's new name it speaks  about the new name oh his name is greg my name is greg opie you share a name with jesus uh the new  jesus look at that the new jesus yeah so so now why don't you do some miracles walk on some water and 
[00:58:30]  stuff the miracle the only miracle i can perform is to um talk clearly and no that's not a miracle  jesus when he was around open your eyes it'll be a miracle when the long-haired go teed white jesus  was walking around he was feeding people and walking on water i can see more people than jesus ever did  how um by having um the world around electrical generation system put in place and then going to 
[00:59:00]  i love and then going to any of the what is the worldwide electrical generation system it's a uh  and a system that links the electrical grid of each of the world countries together so we have  one united grid all around the world so that we're all united and we can people love electricity and  power like it's great and i'm kind of uh screwed up because i love it too like i love machinery and  electronics and beaming and satellites and stuff and now uh jesus yeah greg excuse me uh you think 
[00:59:30]  the whole world should link its electrical system together correct the fact and what will this do  that will um okay well lower birth rates around the world because it's a direct correlation between  the population between electrical consumption and birth rate they love electricity so um as your  electrical electrical consumption goes up your birth rate goes down equally um there's a number of other  benefits can't remember them off hand but the site you look at is jesus can't remember and i dot 
[01:00:00]  work my palm pilot hey god what's moses up to these days heaven heaven and who killed jfk um yeah who did  that and did marilyn monroe really kill herself these are all good questions yeah for jesus known by god we've been  waiting all these years to talk to god you should answer so yeah it is known by god so if everyone  realized they were god that part of god that knows no wait wait you're jesus you came back and people  don't believe you because it's such an amazing thing right well it's supposed to happen i don't know why 
[01:00:30]  well no okay look i'm giving you the benefit of the doubt right here i'm i'm willing to go out on a  limb and say okay you're jesus okay you've got to prove it to me here you've got to give me something  that jesus would and could only do i'll give you a biblical interpretation that nobody's ever heard  before but that's okay something we could touch and and well it's got to be by the bible i don't  know what you're going to go like what do you want for me i want you to turn water into wine all right  well give me some dried wine pills or something i don't know but i have some wine hey he's got that 
[01:01:00]  figured out it's like a hey you're not damn david copperfield you're not a convincing god i'm not  i'm trying to convince you that when the secret service uh brings it to the nightclubs what what  happens uh well the best club in the city is cheetah obviously anyone who's been around the scene knows  that cheetah is the best club in the entire city he's endorsed by that he's wrecked that place as  far as being trendy it's over for cheetah go ahead you don't like nobu so god uh hangs at cheetah with 
[01:01:30]  the secret service well they usually can't hang outside because they can't go in with guns and cheetah  no cops allowed in there with guns so that's a good thing for me yeah yeah everyone else in the  place has guns but secret service have to keep their guns outside right because they're legal they're  um hey hey god who killed uh robert blake's uh wife oh that's a good question very topical who killed  robert blake's wife yeah beretta remember beretta the tv show well that was yesterday right or something  yeah yeah a couple of days ago who did that i don't know just a detective on the case they're god too they 
[01:02:00]  see god knows and god will find out everything because we are all god i think god is full of  that anything that is known to god anything that is known to man is known to god yeah but  you're jesus you are jesus return i'm a human being i am one with all of us you got no powers  though you're crap you're like a superhero with no powers go to light of the wall.com you'll see  my powers i can talk to god has kryptonite in his face pocket any christ yeah hey god can we crucify 
[01:02:30]  you again uh only if it's by lethal injection when the question depends on that now all right uh  i think we've had enough uh all right uh greg gordon god all right thanks a lot good fun guys uh take  care go to his website god.com light of the world it i'm looking at it right now it is it's worse than  foundry on its worst time period remember when i couldn't figure out foundry music before they fixed it  yeah this is impossible there are things thrown all over and topics and i don't know what to make 
[01:03:00]  of it and hoo-hoo look at that all right wonderful we just talked to god yeah sure we did well you  don't believe him we'll take a break keep voting for uh the whipped cream bikini contest the finalists  are up and it's up to you guys to vote wnew.com and foundrymusic.com yes anthony gordon  has six letters and gregory's prize six g-r-e-g-o nope seven yeah well six six plus then the one

[01:06:00]  everyone we met uh over there i didn't run i got tired just watching them run did you i used to be  a runner letting you run sandy ran where's she running from i say i don't get the whole running  thing unless you know what's chasing me or i gotta catch something she uh she ran the half marathon  and she she did well yeah hour and 53 minutes not too shabby did they list the names in the paper  uh um i don't know how did haywood jablomi uh yeah right place did he do well i don't think 
[01:06:30]  he ran in the long island marathon michael hunt no no likes a short name mike no it was no it's funny  because uh i was at the the finish line and the runners come through and uh just every once in  a while there's someone that's just gotta gotta you know make that impression uh-huh and i actually  gotta hand it to a a few guys they dressed up like the village people oh is that what they were  doing and the goofy guy yeah they crossed the finish line as the village people which got a  a huge laugh course huge laugh it's like the guy that dresses in the gorilla suit for like the new 
[01:07:00]  york marathon the boston marathon he's half dead by the time he gets through it but the beer keeps  him going but i gotta say we were up like at five in the morning on sunday most of our listeners just  getting to bed i saw a lot of you guys included saw a lot of you guys on the highway as we were  driving to uh eisenhower park because they are swerving all over the road i'm like man my life  has changed because i used to be the guy swerving home at five and now i'm like like getting up at  five to to bring sandy to run you don't notice him swerving when you're swerving yourself what it was 
[01:07:30]  i think i was probably on my way uh back at that hour after saturday night i was pointing out the  drunks i'm like that guy's drunk that guy you can tell at five and five five o'clock is a dangerous  time to drive easy pickings because who is who is driving around at five in the morning just  on a sunday especially just drunks there's no one going to work there's no delivery trucks out there  it's yeah it's people coming home after like like hooking up at a bar right and they're the real 
[01:08:00]  late-nighters you know right it's not like one in the morning even two in the morning people are  driving home all right there's there's a few drunks out there but there's people maybe coming home from  work late maybe uh whatever but at five in the morning early sunday morning everyone drunk  hammond hammond box of wine yeah they left the bar what two two-thirty got a little tail and now  they're going back to their pet going home five a.m is that hour man so uh so san ran and she did 
[01:08:30]  really really well and then uh we got back home and it was it was beautiful yesterday what was like  80 and just sunny and stuff it was oh you slept the whole day away because i ended up sleeping the  whole day away because i was exhausted all right what do you consider sleeping the whole day away  when did you get up no no well i got up at five we did the marathon in the morning yeah and then uh  we were home by noon and then i crashed from uh noon to six oh okay and said it's funny because sandy  ran the race yeah she looks at me i'm like man this is a great excuse to sleep the day away because i'm 
[01:09:00]  usually looked at as the lazy bastard so i'm like no i'm tired i'm tired from watching you after a  saturday night's party in jersey um i finally got out of bed as sunday three in the afternoon so i was  finally able to get out what time to go to bed though like four or five you got home i don't even  remember wow it was it was really bad i didn't drive big kev is the uh designated driver because he 
[01:09:30]  doesn't drink so it's like oh you want to drive out there fine by me kev's becoming your little  pal and then i got designated driver security can't beat it the guy that doesn't drink oh  that's that gave me an excuse to completely get him because even you even know like if i'm having  a couple of beers right and i know i have to drive like at the office party there that we had right  i'll stop i can't like pound the shots or anything but saturday night i knew i didn't have to drive 
[01:10:00]  oh jägermeister and then when you got to keep up with the likes of lynch and dina cola forget about  it but who says you have to keep up with them no you do but you got it see ben's saying yeah  i don't get the i got to keep up thing well you just want to stay in the same head  you know if if look at ben yeah if you're kind of sober and everyone you're around is hammered  you're not having fun so and it was just a massive party atmosphere right we're hanging drinking 
[01:10:30]  then sunday i got up and went to uh see the mummy saw the mummy i was part of the 70 million returns  70 million uh driven in second place 6.1 million yeah i mean if you were going to the movies this  weekend you went to see the mummy simple as that yeah you got in i mean the lines must have been  just insane yeah well no it wasn't that bad that's one of those movies you show up for like a seven  o'clock uh showing on a saturday night they're like well we're all sold out until midnight and you buy 
[01:11:00]  the midnight tickets and now you got four or five hours to kill i went to the four o'clock it wasn't  bad really bad i went to a big theater though i mean it helped a lot of people right and um it was  good i'll give my thumbs up two thumbs up one here see look there you go how was it how was the uh  special effects special effects are great yeah i love the uh the whole uh huge armies plowing into  each other it's fantastic and just the mummies and the creatures and the uh the army of darkness 
[01:11:30]  that rises out of the sand really cool what about when what in the beginning when they're being chased  on the in the uh double-decker bus yeah and running up the walls and stuff yeah very cool something  they did in the first movie but it's always cool to see the uh guy there uh that uh head muckity  muck with the emote brought back the four big nasty mummies right to chase them down the street and  they're getting away in a double-decker bus and the battle's really cool all the fight scenes the there's 
[01:12:00]  a scene where um where the two chicks yep are going at it rachel wise and uh they both taste yeah she  doesn't look as hot as the first movie what happened no she does you know something yeah maybe the  previews didn't show okay but they they show what happened back in uh ancient egypt right  and these two are in these little egyptian like where you like genie outfits they look like i dream  of genie they're in these little outfits with these three uh three pronged fork things that they're 
[01:12:30]  fighting with right one of the hottest fight scenes i've ever seen i'm watching this and i'm going this  is hot yeah this is like it was a great fight choreographed very well and everything but then  i'm thinking i'm just like this is so hot to watch hot chicks fighting hot chicks fighting and then  they do it again uh toward the end of the movie in their regular clothes right and it's hot again  two hot times chick fight now i heard a rumor yeah that uh the mummies are are dead throughout the 
[01:13:00]  whole movie is that true anthony the mummy's dead throughout the whole movie yes they are just like  six cents okay i just want to make make sure uh andrew dude the mummy stunk oh wait a minute  why did you say it sucks why i'll tell you uh the girl is reincarnated brandon fraser is some kind of  savior and and he's going to save everyone and he was born in an orphanage come on what is that what  brandon fraser had the tattoo on him yeah they fight you know they had a little storyline you know 
[01:13:30]  with the tattoo on his arm and what it means and everything i won't get into it i don't i don't  mean it but all right yeah there were a couple of ridiculous things in there the whole movie's  ridiculous but what are you looking for fact no i love science fiction i will go to every science  fiction movie and tell all my friends i love them this one i walked out with like five minutes left  the balloon he presses a rocket ship button on the balloon and it goes flying away like a jet plane in 1933.  no it wasn't quite that oh it wasn't no the guy's got thank you a rocket ship engine 
[01:14:00]  you make it sound like buck rogers yeah i don't think you go to to the mummy returns uh for a story  no it's more of a special effects uh straganza right it's cool when when when you see the uh the magi  guys you know the guys are the defenders of uh good and whatever and they're in the desert and they're  fighting this uh army of darkness that comes out of the sand it's unbelievable it looks great and 
[01:14:30]  just when you think they're out of trouble i mean you just see more than you could possibly imagine  coming over these sand dunes right it's great stuff yeah it almost looked like uh what they call  the science fiction movie with uh with the bugs oh yeah yeah yeah oh uh stars starship troopers  starship troopers the way they come over the mountain i love when there's so many of something  that you're just like they're so apt but they're never right yeah but that's cool yeah sometimes 
[01:15:00]  they are left and starship troopers they were they were asked repeatedly or that other movie  did you see that uh the one um where the planet was pitch black and the uh the monsters came out of  the darkness man and they had to get back to this other ship and uh the monsters would would just  rip these people apart in pitch blackness i remember that one and they showed a scene in  the preview where the guy spits out a flammable liquid and goes and lights up the area and he's  surrounded by all these monsters in pitch blackness and he only saw him for the split second that you 
[01:15:30]  saw the uh the flare up i'm sure now by now somebody will say was it a popular movie yeah it was it  didn't do well in the movie theater but it's a great rental and what about the pygmies the little  pygmy love the thing mummy things are great bobby come on hey yeah all right real quick uh special  effects are great the movie sucked what had the kid was so unrealistic it wasn't even funny this kid  who uh friggin was putting uh his shirt down over the sandcastle that he was making telling him where 
[01:16:00]  to go back and forth okay i i i'll agree with this part you know i'm not saying it's the best movie ever  i love the special effects the second i saw the kid i'm like oh yeah yeah they got out of those  chains yeah why don't they always they didn't even say why do they always have to throw the kid in  the cute kid it sucked they ruined the entire movie the checks were hot everything else that  all right the kids are thanks bobby thank you guys rock i i have no desire to see the the mummy  returns you really swear i'm not a huge special effects movie oh i really love i'm really not 
[01:16:30]  it was cool faggot what are you talking about that's just not especially i mean the rock  there's no bridges and magic alley jesus christ how do you not like the special effects i love that  i don't know the previews for a couple of the movies that are coming out look great too  i don't know i thought i want to see pearl harbor that i want to say and that'll have some special  effects and i'll get into that sure will i need a little more story with my i don't know special 
[01:17:00]  effects movie uh sometimes you just got to go with a lot less action look i know i'm i'm not in  the you know the majority i mean it made seventy million but it's i i wasn't running out there to  see it i i thought it was great no movie i saw pitch black is the movie pitch black you dumb ass pitch  black you tool they gotta add like it was pitch black ass wipe who was in pitch black i don't even  remember that movie was there anyone in there any star no no no no stars or anything someone's saying 
[01:17:30]  it's faded black no it's pitch black so we can hang up on that all right i think there was one guy in  it but i can't remember his name oh internet movie database i saw i saw a movie recently that uh best  movie i've seen in um a couple of years what and uh what's his name turned us on to that movie a couple  weeks ago when we were talking to him about his movie blow ted denny oh you saw that one he was  talking about the backwards moving uh memento yeah good unbelievable uh guido the killer pimps in it 
[01:18:00]  oh there you go uh ralph from the sopranos was he the whole time and he gets blown away boom that's  how the movie snowed but that okay you see it the first five seconds that's how the movie starts  and it's the end of the movie and then they work their way backwards from there it's like a  backwards episode of seinfeld remember that one yeah the backwards episode  unbelievable movie though seriously if you're looking for something a little different  i mean i would get whatever no one's gonna care 
[01:18:30]  i understand that now so i'm gonna stop but what what which one we'll go to  let me go to louis first uh louis yo what's going on how much how was the rock what did he  do he gonna have more movies out or what the rock didn't even really have any spoken lines at all  like they just showed the beginning and uh he was in uh ancient egypt and and then uh that's it yeah 
[01:19:00]  he uh no you know i think they used them well you don't want the rock you don't want it to be a  movie with a wrestler in it you know how well those do when they have like a but a big part  in it remember when he did his movies oh yeah those are great actually rowdy roddy piper and they  live was pretty good that was actually good that was real good the whole kogan movie is blue oh shock  i mean anytime you try to get a wrestler in a big part in a movie except for they live no the rock is  getting uh rave reviews though and isn't he gonna be in the sequel or whatever the scorpion king they're 
[01:19:30]  actually doing a spin-off of his character because oh really there's a lot behind the character they  figured and he works so well with it they're doing a whole movie the scorpion cake how is he not going  to talk the whole movie though and just go ah and give the people's eyebrow right i swear to god right  before he goes into battle like all the two armies are based uh are facing off across the desert the rock  like puts his head up and goes like he sniffs if you smell what the scorpion king is cooking 
[01:20:00]  jackass and also they made him do that with they they also do that with the with the computer  generated computer generating at the end scorpion king rock gave the little computer generated rock  people eyebrows before he went after brendan but that is a kick-ass beast man you get to see somebody  gets totally dismembered oh that's right oh jesus christ head arms leg body fly different directions  different pieces god damn that was great come on who doesn't like that john what's up that's great 
[01:20:30]  hey uh you know that you guys were just talking about pro harbor before you know what i'm you  gotta admit the previews for that movie look just looks great unbelievable right uh the thing is is  that like all those planes that you see are all computer generated they only had one real plane that  they could use and they based everything on that but you know what you can't even tell  that looks great from the previews all the zeros flying over uh hawaii yeah when you have the two  kids standing on top of the mountain and they just sit there like holy eff and that looks great  two thousand planes coming in that's one of those oh my god you're screwed and they got screwed 
[01:21:00]  you know how that one ends all right take you later fellas bomb's eye view is another great special  effect that they showed in the um preview of pearl harbor when the zero drops the bomb yeah and it  follows it right down to the deck of the ship oh they really got uh special effects figured out  that finally it's amazing when you look at the previews like pearl harbor like it's all computer  generated and you go back to like uh et and they do the little bicycle ride in the sky and you can  tell that it's it's all boxed out and looks fake and everything but back then it was like wow kick-ass 
[01:21:30]  special effects yeah and of course if you ever went to universal studios tour you could see how it was  done maybe rick could be there to show you this is what's filmed in front of a blue screen  now if we can get a young boy from the audience to sit in this bicycle and we will actually reenact  the scene from et and the kid gets on the bicycle they have the blue screen they put the scenery  behind it and everyone looks at the tv monitors it looks so bad it looks so bad it's like soap opera 
[01:22:00]  car trip bed we're out the back window you can tell they're they're in the studio and it's a blue screen  they also do that with uh with alfred hitchcock alfred hitchcock where they have you hanging from  the uh what do you call statue of liberty oh yes yes you're hanging down now make like you're kicking  look up but but you're hanging there and smiling and laughing because with the universal studio shirt  on i remember we went into the universal studio thing with the earthquake with another one yeah where 
[01:22:30]  you reenact the scene from the movie earthquake all right now your job is to stand here and when  you look at the monitor it's going to look like the building's shaking so you have to move around  like it's an earthquake and you look at the monitor going look at this idiot shaking around with a big  smile on their face you're kind of taking me out of the action here look horrified tell me and then  get on the tram and listen to rick hey paul what's going on hey lp i daily agree with you but i got to 
[01:23:00]  tell you something memento was and is the best movie so far this year that movie's so whacked out it's  unbelievable yeah i mean you're not gonna get the special effects there's not that many different  scenes there's only what six to eight characters but yeah but but very clever right well anthony it's  one of the movies that i downloaded from the news group that you can't get the movies from about  three months ago so damn you did i mean it no i have somebody else that does it for me now as long as  they're not on raw it you know that's the whole thing anthony would enjoy memento you really would 
[01:23:30]  yeah oh yeah anthony i hate movies like newtronic ross with uh uh saturday night he has no short-term  memory paul oh i know i know the uh story oak told me yeah so i don't have to see it thank you  don't talk about the ending of pearl harvey you'll ruin it shut up paul hey hey guys what's up paul  the jew hey hey oh when the movie memento ended were you like what the f just happened yeah yeah i  i i gotta see it again i'm sitting in a packed theater everyone's looking at each other like 
[01:24:00]  three people clap because i think they just figured they're supposed to know what's going on  but everyone else is like what the hell just what the hell's going on i got a bunch of theories but  i don't want to wreck it for anyone because it's it was even if you tried to wreck it no one would  know what the hell was going on it's impossible to pick up on everything as the movie's playing i mean  it was cool as hell but like it ended and you're like i'm waiting for the rental so i could just flat out  stop it and maybe uh the view the movie backwards it still wouldn't make sense yeah it would yeah  no it wouldn't it goes backwards but if you play it backwards then it goes forward it would just 
[01:24:30]  yeah what that makes sense i swear to god that makes sense on some like no i swear to god well  the memento starts at a point and works its way backwards right yeah but so if you get the rental  and start from the end of the actual movie and go backwards it's actually forward all i know the  the only important thing is that carrie ann morse was a hot piece of ass in that movie uh yes all  right paulie later boy bye and i did see the uh preview for jurassic park 3 which is supposed to 
[01:25:00]  be the big blockbuster coming out i wasn't very happy with what i saw wow i i because tony's online  10 saying it was amazing really i wasn't very happy with what i saw because the whole gist that they  give you is that um now they have some kind of a i don't know they did some kind of research on the  eggs or something and now they think now they're thinking and planning like the velociraptors are even  smarter now and they set traps and do things i don't know i don't need thinking dinosaurs it was 
[01:25:30]  funny though all of a sudden like i hear uh i hear this sound coming out  some of this here and i go i hope you just reached for his wallet it's the same sound  i got a little chuckle it never makes you laugh you sick ass but i don't like the thinking you know  dinosaur angle two simple words jaws three oh 
[01:26:00]  jaws 3d jaws 3d how about jaws uh why not uh why not jurassic park 3d the final conflict or  whatever that was yes what was that one the last one they made this time it's personal yeah oh the  shark is after you i got a way to beat it stay out of the water i win and why are you going i have  to go out on a boat yeah confront the shark yeah why are you going to the bahamas move to i don't  know kansas kansas kansas i defy that shark to get you in kansas right it'll run through the sewers 
[01:26:30]  yeah although that's what they'll do bite you in the ass while you're changing your tampon most  problems aren't uh solved that easily uh fast and the furious you see the as for this the street  racing movie that looks cool yeah it looked pretty pretty good there's some driving in that  where the cars are passing underneath the trailer of the trucks and stuff because it's about street  drag racing street drag racing so you watch this movie will be the one that oh my god now kids 
[01:27:00]  are drag racing because of what they see in the movies right and you know kids are going to crash  trying to reenact something underneath the semi yeah i'm going to take my car under the semi you own  a pickup you idiot the guy's doing it in a little toyota oh jim ah jim how are you doing all right  i have a question for you jim you gotta call back that is a distorted he want to talk about final  fantasy i saw the preview for that i saw like 18 previews today going into uh you know that  stayed in the obvious but i mean the preview thing is getting just ridiculous you know what we don't 
[01:27:30]  even leave our house until if it's a 10 20 movie we don't leave our house till 10. no i don't mind  15 20 minutes to get to the theater so i'm like well i don't mind no no this time of year the previews  are great but i mean in the middle of the winter oh yeah when there's not many really good movies  coming out you said it's a story of love you sit through some crap oh boy  that's a story of never-ending love oh no and was this freaking previews never in how was final 
[01:28:00]  fantasy it looked really good look good a lot of the computer generated stuff are they showing up  tomb raider uh yeah so previous to that too how does she look she looks good but i wasn't getting  really pumped for the for the movie the preview didn't do it for me i played all the tomb raiders  too yeah they might like it i don't know she's gonna reen it for me she might reen it because  lara croft is that fantasy i just can't get a computer chick i just can't get past like all  right oh there she is speeding in her little jeep thing or on her uh her little uh vehicle what was 
[01:28:30]  that thing she used to ride the all-terrain vehicle yeah in the game it's like oh they have  to put the game things in and you know that's the only reason it's there i don't know i wasn't i  kind of wasn't you know what i think the mummy you know we're up to two we're up to two mummy  movies right that's kind of taking the you know the juice away from tomb raider in a way yes because  a lot of the same type of effects you know you shoot a mummy and what does it do hoping it breaks  apart and turns to dust right that's what mummies do i learned that from the mummy movie 
[01:29:00]  all right i guess we're done with movies for now  oh the guy in fast and furious was in pitch black how about that it's a small world benny has a  comment about the jurassic park movie benny what's up hey yeah go ahead hey yeah um you know that  fast and furious movie yeah yeah um that movie gonna be real good i like it that thing has a lot  of speed in it and stuff all right another movie that was really really good we got a prize pack a

[01:36:30]  friends oh sorry i got carried away this is this is what we're going to do uh manhattan all right  straight down broadway okay we're going to pop into jersey colin carteret we're going to take uh  jersey all the way up uh to to like the westchester area taking a long way big loop all the way up all  the way up and then uh we'll do a little westchester action and then uh we're going to hit long island  cool and then back uh to manhattan are any new teams going to be on this bus not a bad idea we'll 
[01:37:00]  see we'll see which ones we can pick up on the way yeah we're going to figure out who's going to be on  the bus and all that we're picking up the car wash anthony we're looking for runaways looking for  runaways right we'll pick up hitchhikers and opie how many stickers right now do we have in this building  that we're going to take out with us and um uh we have five stickers five stickers left in the building  yeah and where are we getting 100 000 stickers i hate this place nothing works here

[01:38:00]  another bus no we're gonna try to uh keep everything on the up and up with this one uh i have faith that  we will have a hundred thousand stickers by friday yeah because what's his name from uh the sticker  place is the coolest guy in the world then give him a give him a plug in i know his name's ted but  where does he work this guy hooks us up when we need prime time plus yeah jersey all right we'll have  the stickers yeah without a doubt we'll have the hundred thousand stickers and uh we're going to  spend friday on the road the whole day so we'll be doing the show kind of live from the bus and stuff 
[01:38:30]  road trip it's a road trip a little o and a road trip you guys can follow us if you want we don't  care we're going to try to get a bunch of locations that we're definitely going to be at  hopefully we'll put that on websites and stuff so you know uh where we're going to be in jersey  where we're going to be in westchester where we're going to be on long island but on the way as we're  stopping and we're stuck in traffic we're just going to be i'll hand them out handing them out  left and right so yeah and that's that it's gonna rock more details on that as the week goes on i've 
[01:39:00]  seen uh we're just hoping that the the staff could get it together for us because this is what we  want to do i've seen pictures of the inside of this bus and it looks like it's a party but it's a tour bus  that like a band would tour looks like the limp biscuit tour bus yeah i mean it's it's unbelievable  and so now i'm figuring if we get into reality by uh friday we'll have a hyundai to drive around  you know paul ass on line one are you going to staten island yeah i kind of i i blew off brooklyn 
[01:39:30]  and staten island yes oh we'll be going through there sure yeah we're going to all that and then  we're going to go to all the boroughs jersey westchester hopefully even just a piece of  connecticut to say we did it we're going to drive through east new york in brooklyn and reenact the  scene from the gauntlet the clint eastwood movie with the bus and the firearms and i'll see if we  make it through our goal is to hit uh just just about everywhere this this damn you know show broadcast  too so staten island only gets half sticker half sticker half sticker for staten island stopping 
[01:40:00]  whole bus only half sticker whole promotions of half so should be fun bring lots of bail money  all right anthony yes what's your take on robert blake this is a twisted story there's some unanswered  questions here and now it seems uh robert blake everyone knows the story right his uh his young  hot wife of 44 years was uh gunned down as he went back into the restaurant they just ate at i guess 
[01:40:30]  he was driving home realizing he left something is well here's what happened they uh they were eating  at this restaurant out there that he had gone to uh forever he's been going there for years vitello's  in la so uh they're eating in there he comes out gets in his car with his wife then he goes oops i forgot  my gun inside the restaurant right there is like hello what if you're carrying a gun and you go into a 
[01:41:00]  restaurant you don't it's not the old west check your guns you don't have to check your gun it's  still on you but he says he had to go in for his gun he said it kind of fell off his person right just  kind of that too just kind of fell off he had it in his waistband or something he's beretta for god's  sake how's it falling how's he losing his weapon well beretta's got to realize that uh dying the hair  is just not working anymore all the uh shoe black uh hair color let me tell you the thing about dying  your hair okay you know you could dye your hair for many years and you you look fine and there's 
[01:41:30]  no problem with that you know if you gotta do you gotta do it but there comes a time that you just  get too old and to dye your hair it looks just completely ridiculous yes he's at that stage he's  at the uh age yeah so he he goes in says he gotta get his gun now the uh one of the owners of this  restaurant this uh vitello's place said when he walked in he looked a little shaken up and he 
[01:42:00]  didn't come in to pick anything up he asked for uh two glasses of water which he downed and then went  outside so that kind of weird right there again now he goes outside lo and behold his wife is shot in the  head right in uh the front seat of his car so he goes across the street it's kind of weird he could  have been uh away from his wife for more than five minutes tops yeah he goes across the street 
[01:42:30]  bangs on some guy's door he answers the door they call 9-1-1 he's run back he's puking he's freaking  out freaking out puking yeah and uh then the cops come the ambulance and she's dead now he's hired a  private investigator well i guess this uh this wife has had a shady past she's one of these uh ladies  that would kind of find lonely men with lots of money and milk them for all they're worth to milk  them uh she's also uh had she's on probation for um fake id like she had gotten someone else's identity 
[01:43:00]  to write bad checks and credit cards and whatnot she's been doing that that was in her past so they're  saying all right maybe her past caught up to her but it's just it just is a little weird the whole  robert blake going into the restaurant thing and they're questioning him and they're searching now  they're saying at this time robert blake is not a suspect all right can i give you my take uh-huh 
[01:43:30]  he's 67 she's 44 she has this past of milking you know guys with lots of money they have a kid  together have a kid together which is all part of the scam you know all right without a doubt she  was milking them yeah somehow he found out maybe she was seeing some other guy on the side right and  he hired a hit oh now this is your speculation based on the limited facts that you have at this  point yeah just a hunch allegedly allegedly of course you know when no one knows for sure but i don't 
[01:44:00]  think he he didn't kill her no no way no no he didn't kill but he he knows you you think he knows  who who might have uh done it or might have orchestrated it or something oh it's just a little  shaky that that small what is time period that he went inside all right a bunch of people saying we're  missing points of the story that's why we we all right we do this show together mike hey how's it going  guys hey yeah uh what do we call it his wife she uh allegedly she was you know she was sleeping around 
[01:44:30]  with uh marlon brando's uh son christian was but isn't that that was a lot that's who they thought  the kid was from yeah yeah that was that's part of her past though yeah yeah it was also that uh  she the reason to carry around a gun was she was freaking out because she thought that like someone's  gonna kill her or something well hey so yeah so he was carrying that around and everything so you  know all right mike i guess you uh filled in all the holes for us i don't know it seemed a little 
[01:45:00]  weird ed dudes yeah you're missing the whole point i'm thinking that the hair dye is to draw your  attention away from the fact that he now looks like the joker since he got that facelift yeah have you  seen him like on the tonight show i saw the pictures when they were questioning him on the  news and it was pretty scary he is one freakish looking dude he's got the facelift and he's dying  the hair doesn't look human he's got to have a skin knot on the back of his skull god damn all right 
[01:45:30]  hey you guys rule thank you bye bye lenny lenny hey what's up guys hey um let's say i just want i think  there's something obviously it smells of setup i mean the guy uh robert blake suppose we have a  carrying a gun because of what his you know four things you just said she felt threatened and that  uh obviously somebody was probably following her around and she got wind of it and um i mean you  don't forget if you if you're a gun holder it's not something that you just like lose like your wallet 
[01:46:00]  no that's like a huge uh violation all right you can lose your your license to carry for doing that  i mean the thing is you have if you're carrying a weapon you know what that thing is all the time  mm-hmm and it's just like oh you know walk out of the restaurant and say oh i forgot it i think  i i left it on on a table or whatever i used it to hold the tip down and i didn't realize it was my  gun and i walked out there's a couple things there maybe robert blake he has a witness that that that 
[01:46:30]  is pretty much seeing him getting his gun from the restaurant right yeah so they keep so the people  can't can say look you know he he couldn't have shot her he came back to get this gun obviously but  anthony's got another theory on the gun if it was do you remember what you were saying in the  back office if it was a hit and that to make it even better he would come out of the restaurant  right he would come out and and fire a few shots in the air or something to make it look like he was  trying to to save her and uh i don't know did did are there any reports that anyone saw anyone walk 
[01:47:00]  up and shoot her drive away no one heard or saw nothing nothing and she ends up shot in the head  no one sees a thing right except for when robert blake runs to the house hey reese what's up hey  what's up reese hey man do we do we need mark firman to drop like you know a bloody glove in  the coach room no to figure out no no no no he's a hiring an investigator just hire oj 
[01:47:30]  in my spare time while i'm not looking for nicole's killer i will look for robert blake's  wife's killer too oh wait my tea time's coming up i have to go chip a few golf balls but i'll be  back robert and help you out uh was i seen in the area no no okay i'm not a suspect that one down a lot  to go i think maybe have you spoken to your parakeet or that old rummy that was on barretta with you 
[01:48:00]  perhaps it was the parakeet no knife was used wait i have to take this phone call hi it's bill  shatner why not just drown the bitch worked for me right wow guns are so messy gentlemen i say  gotta lick it up and have a check the drain at the bottom of the bowl that's what i did bill shatner 
[01:48:30]  easy quick clean like the vulcan nerve pitch  thank you bill john what's going on yeah uh i was probably thinking that this whole thing  is coming from the train where oj had him kill his wife and then vice versa to work it out oh so oj  did this but robert blake is the killer of nicole yeah he's just paying back a favor okay i'll shoot  her lisa's got something to add here lisa you're next on wnew hi guys how you doing pretty good today 
[01:49:00]  robert blake's wife allegedly was receiving death threats that's supposedly why he got the gun  now the whole little twist of the story is that they don't know if robert blake put the person up to  giving her the death threats or not well i'm sure once they go into all kinds of phone records and  everything else they might they might get something if that's the case the insinuation is that it was one  of her old lovers that allegedly she did burn all these old guys one of her old lovers something's  turning back up again you know robert blake's lawyer said uh that the actor only married his 
[01:49:30]  wife because she became pregnant with his child right they don't even live in the same house that  doesn't uh sound good oh oh but the guy's 67 right well yeah that's why he probably left the gun man  he's old he forgets things 67's not that old all right lisa thank you bye bill has a theory on what  happened ah theories i love theories yeah conspiracy theory or just a regular theory it's a regular 
[01:50:00]  theory all right bill i'm thinking that he went into the restaurant and got a drink of water because  he was sweating he was nervous well that's what the uh the owner of the restaurant said he looked a little  shaky and he asked the two glasses of water and down to both right there yeah come on he's sweating  he's nervous he knows what's about to get capped he knows because yeah all right he knows about it he  goes in the restaurant and now he's freaking out like oh my god it's going down right now get me some  goddamn water i'm sweating remember the cotton mouth you used to get as a kid before you try to  hide some donuts oh yeah imagine you're going to go away somebody or have somebody taken out 
[01:50:30]  oh i would have got gin if it was me all right thanks bill but  appeared flustered yeah asked for two glasses of water drank them and left it did not appear  that blake retrieved anything the owner said so what's with the gun story i don't know  would have made a perfect columba though robert blake could play robert blake  so you say you went back into the restaurant to get your gun who do you think shot your wife 
[01:51:00]  oj simpson okay oj will play oj this is great we don't have to get martin landau at all  and i suppose the getaway car was starsky and hutch's old uh sereno  has anyone questioned huggy bear i don't know why you trusted him so much he was a pimp  i believe also dining in a restaurant was angie dickinson police woman 
[01:51:30]  and i hear you high in barnaby jones or was it petra kelly  this whole murder was a quinn martin production  autopsy was done by quincy  i love the hollywood murder stories  they're too they're surreal when actors are involved like this  this one's just shaky i cannot wait till uh more details come out on this one this is gonna get 
[01:52:00]  really interesting robert flake robert rummy okay let's go to don before we take a break here  don what's up hey john or hey guys you're done yeah i'm john uh would you guys agree that last night  sopranos are probably the best the whole season it was really good last night was a good one but i'm  still i'm i'm a little i'm getting a little pissed with the show there's not enough of that there's  not enough good action that fight between the uh russian guy and uh and paulie and christopher 
[01:52:30]  and the house and everything that stuff was great and then the shovel over the head  paulie loses his shoe yeah i mean it was kind of uh slapstick funny stuff going on it was like a vaudeville  routine yeah and the pines in jersey um i can't believe we lost we're in jersey  there's uh there's only what two episodes left yeah they better get some crazy ass going on the  next two weeks you think that russian guy's still alive oh without a doubt oh well come on dude he 
[01:53:00]  he took the car and now he's on his way to tell his boss and paulie is dead yeah you know he killed  16 chesnids and he's an inferior decorator that was pretty funny with the cell phone cutting out  i don't know with the sopranos though you never know i mean it's obvious to everyone that paulie's  dead right yeah there's gonna be some weird twist that something will happen that's that and then a  lot of people saying that uh uh uh what's his jackie jr is dead no way no they won't kill him off that 
[01:53:30]  quick that's just going to develop uh you know the tension between ralphie and tony obviously meadow uh  leaves her uh by the way they called it x last night you bastards jesse you're not here because  you call it x everyone knows they call it e now all right guys well great until last night by the  way by the way if uh jesse's listening call the show we got some news for you today our old intern 
[01:54:00]  jesse thank you don all right yeah but the sopranos rocked last night yeah and then uh uh meadow  what we were saying with uh jackie jr meadow caught him with another chick and uh he's walking out of  his place with the chick meadow confronts him and they what did the girl say it's like uh she's a  whore yeah bitch called her a bitch and stuff that's tony soprano's daughter well you should think  about that instead of telling you who is he's she was a whore that should have to be pretty good 
[01:54:30]  that i just i just hope the next two weeks rock yeah they got so much going on so many storylines  now yeah but now they got to do something with them i said it from the beginning tony's like side  bitch yeah psycho psycho i threw a steak in his head i knew that from you know the first time she  she was uh she entered the show this year wait i'm telling you that girl's gonna go psycho on tony  when he walked into uncle june's place i'm gonna do what are you eating steak 
[01:55:00]  because she smelled like steak she threw a big that looked like a great piece of london broil  threw it right at the back of his head and then proceeds to tear up the table and everything  and he just turns around and looks at her you'll see what i thought he was going to say something  like that don't f yourself there was a new term last night when they were walking in the oh what  was the word they used yeah what was it auntie because i can't say the word oh yeah yeah don't 
[01:55:30]  go getting auntie on me auntie on me yeah right right that's pretty good of course talking about  the c-word oh yeah i never heard that before i never heard that either auntie don't get auntie on me  all right every show talks about the soprano so i mean whatever it was good we all know it blah  blah blah blah stop acting auntie right that's what it was jesse yeah our old pal our old intern 
[01:56:00]  what's going on i'm shopping you're shopping yeah my new apartment what are you shopping for like  food and stuff nice food how was the hoboken festival over over the weekend well other than  my uh mishap in the morning it was very good yeah what happened uh well i just moved into my apartment  and apparently somehow my power went out in the middle of the night thereby cutting off my alarm 
[01:56:30]  and i didn't wake up i was to get up at like six if only the power grids of all the countries were  connected open this stuff wouldn't happen just like god told us early so what time did you have to be at  the station to go to hoboken i had to be at the station about eight o'clock eight o'clock and i  see your legs come back and uh what's your power i can tell about one one yes and what happened to  your cell phone when they were calling that it was charging charging it off so no one could get a hold  of you and john didn't know where you were and he had to go there with the wow van right yeah and i 
[01:57:00]  felt really bad what happened john my first event and i screwed up and it was your first event yes  what what happened to the train well then yes then of course my luck is awesome so then i go to get  the train in uh south orange and it just didn't come the whole booking train never came it was  come at 1107. i see your legs come back so the train never came yeah i thought the 1207 train came 
[01:57:30]  but the 1107 didn't so well well you had to be on the 1107 train well that was the that was the best  train i could catch that was the first one i could catch once i woke up hence you got on 1207 and that's  why you got to hoboken by one exactly i ain't saying you're a lying scumbag first impression i  heard a lot of people were really pissed yeah i got there and earl was yelling at me and  nothing works here what what jess 
[01:58:00]  jess earl was yelling at me right he was just like any comment go ahead anytime i said anything he was  just like say nothing i'd say your legs come back and i heard the sales people were all bummed out  yeah because i was put up the banners and i didn't get there on time  and no they had just like i think one of them had to do it with john  oh and this was your first and that was supposed to be my job and i you know i screwed up this is  your first event yeah and your alibi was a little weak that's what i'm not trying to make an alibi 
[01:58:30]  i take responsibility for it i mean i mean what what a coincidence i mean your electricity goes out  your cell phone's charging and uh a train that is never late doesn't show up well they the new  york train didn't come either the new york train was supposed to come at 1102 and uh no one never  showed up either right hmm made it go on the first day right i didn't press the suits jesse yeah 
[01:59:00]  so what do you have to say for yourself uh just said i'm sorry and i i called dan i accepted  responsibility for it and uh i promised it would never happen again what did dan say uh he wasn't  there so i left him a message uh a lot of people asking is this the same guy that was in the fake  uh uh car accident no no we fired him what the hell were you thinking  um earl's gonna take great pleasure uh earl earl earl's in the studio black earl hello 
[01:59:30]  someone known for his work ethic yes earl i was just so mad at this guy yesterday i just get i cut  him no slack he showed up at one o'clock just like a hoboken uh festival huge hundred thousand  people gorgeous day and we only had three people to begin with jesse's not there now we only have  two people earl and and poor john you know john was late waiting for him um jesse yeah john here john has 
[02:00:00]  a great piece of uh detective uh uh logic here how could you be charging your cell phone if the power  was out well that's my point it was off because when you charge you have to leave it off but then  it wasn't technically charging when i got up but it was in the charger but off this is i see your legs  come back this is as suspicious as the robert blake thing how did you so john was late i left my gun 
[02:00:30]  yeah on top of it i made john late because he was waiting for me because i was with the drive yeah john  was waiting at the station for how long john waiting for jesse and you were calling his cell phone and  really freaking out right because you're new to this uh new job yeah i mean like i figured john  and jesse did such a good job interning for us we would throw a bowl and give them this uh this job  for the summer yeah i mean i waited a good amount of time but you know and then finally had to give  up right yeah but of course like i was going to give him like a window of opportunity because i knew  there he would never skip out on something like that right just because oh i just don't feel like  going so i hung out for a little while made sure if he was coming i didn't want to leave him 
[02:01:00]  behind and have him stand in any w and then he's really of no help to anybody you know what i mean yeah  so it's only the biggest station promotion of the entire year for wnew might add uh ryan on line  10 who was the driver of that uh train wants to say sorry to jesse he says uh jesse i'm sorry that  the 1107 didn't make it my alarm didn't go off oh i just didn't go to work that day well then that's  understandable yeah obviously i see where he's coming from with that by the way jesse they said x on the 
[02:01:30]  sopranos last night you tool yeah i was i was angry because there they are trying to be hip again and  they have it all wrong jesse jesse can you hear me jesse okay jesse let's make sure jesse  this is too good ben i'm going to give this one to you what do you want i'm giving this one to you  cool am i getting a silent game now no i said jesse didn't you hear me no i'm i can't i didn't hear  what you said where are you i'm in a supermarket all right operate and what are you uh shopping for

[02:16:00]  medication doesn't work the medications don't work no one knows how to write copy nothing works here  fans firing people fans firing people i hate this place i've been here for three years i've been here  for seven years three years i've been here for seven years i've been here for three years i hate this  place i do hate this place the medications don't work contract runs out in three and a half weeks i've 
[02:16:30]  been here for seven years no one knows how to write copy i hate this place no one knows how to hand out  wow stickers. Nothing works here. Absolutely nothing works here. I've been here for seven  years. Wow. That's a claim where the copy should be perfect. It's not like horny goat  weed or something. Yeah. It's all about communicating your message to the people. And you're talking 
[02:17:00]  about kids of opportunities and a campus in Stratford. Maybe they do that. You go to  Connecticut School of Broadcasting. They give you this copy and you have to find out what's  wrong with it. And it's just riddled with errors. Maybe that's part of the class, Opie. Wow.  Never gets boring around here. Are we going to Stratford with our bus this Friday to hand  out wow stickers? I think we can make a stop over in Stratford. I love Stratford. All right. 
[02:17:30]  Well, Anthony, there you go. The Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting. You want a little  dose of honesty? You'll find it here on the Opie and Anthony show. You're a couple of idiots.  Filthy, disgusting, breezy idiots. 1027 WNE7.  212-757-1027 is our phone number. Mary's upset with us. Mary, what's wrong? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, man. Okay. I think you guys totally jumped the gun there. I mean, you could have  at least, like, investigated a little bit to see, you know, if his excuses panned out.  Are you talking about Jesse or Robert Blake? Jesse. Jesse. Come on. Oh, okay.  Totally. Like, you guys totally sort of, like, you totally jumped the gun, you know? Like,  whatever happened to us being innocent before being proven guilty, you know? That's in a court  of law. Yeah. I couldn't believe that. Yeah, this is the O&A show. Ah, so there's different 
[02:18:30]  rules. We work differently. He's got a great story to tell. I don't know, though. He obviously  had to work hard to get where he is, you know? He had a paying job there and everything.  Eh, we were kind of just throwing him a bone because we really liked John better and they  were roommates. Ah, well, I think it's John. Jesus, man. That's so true. So true. That's  uncomfortable because John's, like, best friend and roommate just got fired and he's still 
[02:19:00]  here. It just makes for a fun work environment. Oh, my God. Yo, did you guys plan that Connecticut  School of Broadcasting thing or did it just pop up in the breaks? We don't plan anything. Can't  you tell? I don't know. That was too perfect, though. It was way too perfect. Mary, let me tell  you something about this place. Reality is so much better than anything we can write. I mean,  we have a library for a communication school and the copy is all left up. The copy is so screwed up 
[02:19:30]  that it's hard to read. You can't write better material than that. Is there really a place  called Stratford? And by the way, we know it's Stratford, you idiots. Yeah. Go along  with the joke. It's Stratford. People calling up outside. Tell those guys it's Stratford.  I know it's not Stratford. It's Stratford. Oh, really? It just came in from Venus. I have  no clue. And we also know that Robert Blake didn't have a parakeet. No, it was a cockatoo.  Some girl's calling up going, it was a cockatoo, not a parakeet. Yeah, but OJ calling it 
[02:20:00]  a parakeet's funnier than a cockatoo, you twat. Don't give me a cockatoo. You guys should  at least give him, you know, investigate a little bit. He had his excuses turn out. Mary,  man, we spent at least 10 minutes investigating. Yeah, but he had an excuse for everything,  you know? Exactly. That means he's lying. Let me tell you something, Mary. This isn't really,  it has nothing to do with how it happened or looking for facts. Some of it is just, I think, 
[02:20:30]  maybe his own bad luck, that it was his first day on the job. And I bet people could come  up with plenty of stories about how they screwed up on their first day on the job.  Do you really think he's that stupid? Like, he screwed up on purpose the first day on the  job. You think he's that stupid? Let's just put it this way, Mary. He has a history as an  intern. If he has a history, then how did he get the paying gig there? We told you, because  John's his roommate, we like John better, and we kind of just did this. Oh. What's wrong?  I thought Jesse was kind of funny. Oh, no, he's definitely, he's a hilarious kid. He's 
[02:21:00]  working on trying to get into broadcasting. What, what college student do you know that  would intentionally throw away a gig in the biggest, hey, you're walking on thin ice  there, pal. I know Jesse. Rick can go off on a confusion. All right, John, now you're  working on, you want to go on thin ice. Yeah, John, come on. I'm just presenting a possibility  to you guys. I was thinking for some of my friends, too, but after a while, you've got to  say, look, John, John, it's what it is. It's about any knowledge of Jesse. Right. Yeah, 
[02:21:30]  I'll go in for two seconds. Okay. All right. It's nice now. I don't have anyone around  there. I just want to punch every two seconds. Oh. Ben really didn't like Jesse. Ben always  thought he was a music snob, too. Well, he's a music snob, and that's a whole other story  for a different day, but, you know. I know what it is between Jesse and Ben without boring  people, and we can move on to the Bugs Bunny cartoon, which is pretty interesting. Ben  prides himself in being, I want to be careful about this, like Hip in the know. Like, he 
[02:22:00]  knows, like, he knows the city. He knows music. He knows, you know, what drugs the kids are  taking today. He's just, he's in tune with his surroundings. Right. And he takes pride in  that, because he does a lot of reading and stuff. Okay. I want to say this carefully.  All right. Ben is, like, he knows New York and all that. And Jesse comes in and, you  know, kind of challenges Ben's knowledge, and it pisses him off, because it's, you know. 
[02:22:30]  You understand what I'm saying? With the knowledge of the city and music.  Ben will casually mention a band or a club, and Jesse will be quick to tell Ben, oh, man,  that's. Oh, that sucks. Oh, that sucks. That's the biggest piece of crap. Yeah, that's  not the, that's not the happening. Felt Boy Swim sucks. He is the worst. Shut up. Oh,  and the other thing I heard was, uh, you were saying something. Yeah, this new Godsmack  rocks and stuff, and he's like, Godsmack rocks, it's the same tune every time. Yeah. That  was, that was one. And Ben just lost his mind. Stone Tone Pilots suck. They're the biggest  piece of crap, man. I'm just like, dude, shut up. Take your pants and take your stupid 
[02:23:00]  slick hair and jump off the GW, okay? Wow. But that's basically what it's based on. Oh, Jesus.  Like, uh, a club will be mentioned in the back office, which is truly a happening place,  if you care about those things. And, uh, and Jesse will try to tell you why it's not happening.  It's not a cool spot. Even Steve just came into me, and Steve even couldn't stand him  either, because him and Steve had an argument. Oh, he would, he would go on and on, oh, yeah,  well, they were great before they sold out, about, like, bands like Metallica, or, or. 
[02:23:30]  They sold out. Oh, they were. Well, the Metallica is not the best example. Okay, well,  poor example. I just can't think of the real one, but he would go on and on. I mean,  he just wouldn't know anything, so he'd try to think of a smart-ass excuse to cover for  the fact that he didn't know what he was talking about. All right. Oh. All right,  enough with that. Another firing live on our show. Stinky's loving this one.  It's the best. And Spaz was fired, too. You got to go back to that one. We fired a lot  of people. His was done right before the show one day, because he didn't want to be Spaz 
[02:24:00]  anymore. Anyway. Anthony, what do you got on the Bugs Bunny cartoons? It's a more,  more, another case of, um, political correctness coming into play. You know, Bugs Bunny cartoons.  Grow up watching them. Warner Brothers put them out. Well, a cartoon network is going to  do this, uh, whole retrospect on Bugs Bunny next month. And they're leaving out about a  dozen cartoons based on racial insensitivity, Opie. They are racially insensitive. Some 
[02:24:30]  of these, uh, cartoons, you might remember, uh, parodying, uh, black-faced Al Jolson. Well,  the truth of the matter is Al Jolson used to do black-faced stuff. And, and doesn't it give  you a little insight into what was going on at the time that these cartoons came out in the  thirties and, uh, forties? You could, you could get, they haven't run these cartoons  in a long time. These, these sensitive cartoons. Yeah. Our, our friend Buzzy, he has, uh, all 
[02:25:00]  the band cartoons, all the Bugs Bunny band cartoons. And there, there were cartoons that  were on TV where they show black people being lazy, eating watermelon with flies around their  head as they're taking naps under trees. Yeah. Swear to you, this is Bugs Bunny. Okay. They  had, uh, Bugs Bunny cartoons where Bugs was dressed up like Hitler or something, right? Yeah.  There, there are a bunch of the ones made during the war where, uh, Japanese guys are portrayed as 
[02:25:30]  the big buck tooth, uh, Japs and they're, they're slanty eyes and stuff. Yeah. Like caricatures  of, uh, Jap, uh, Japanese people. Japs. They were calling them Japs back then. Well, get the Jap.  And, uh, uh, a German, same thing. The big fat Schultz German guy. Yeah. And Bugs always  won. You know, he always kicked the Nazis and the Japs. They took those, uh, off TV years  ago. Yeah. Now, I mean, you can still get them kind of underground and stuff. Yeah. And, 
[02:26:00]  and they didn't stop there though, because then they started getting rid of all the violence  from all these Bugs Bunny cartoons, which pisses me off to this day. Cause that's part of the  fun. The Wabbit season, Duck season one's a perfect example where they started editing out  where, um, they'd get there, where Daffy would get his beak shot off. They, they would edit  it out. It, then the cartoon makes no goddamn sense. You're watching it. All of a sudden  they say Wabbit season, Duck season. And the scene cut to Daffy putting his bill back, uh, 
[02:26:30]  in front of his face. You're like, well, that isn't how it went. That isn't how the writers  and the guys that drew this stuff by hand years ago, uh, wanted it to be made. And if you're  going to put out a retrospective on Bugs Bunny, you could present it in a way that,  Hey, this was during wartime or Hey, this was during the thirties when this was an acceptable  thing to do. Pretty much go on there and go, this was so wrong, but we want to show you.  Well, you know what it is? Warner brothers pulled it and said, no, we were going to pull 
[02:27:00]  a dozen episodes. Cause they were going to put a disclaimer or something, maybe something  like that. But because of the multi million dollars that Bugs Bunny merchandising makes  for Warner brothers, they don't want to taint that image with a racist Bugs Bunny or a violent  Bugs Bunny. So they're going to take out a bunch of cartoons, which you can't cover up  what, what the past was. You know what I mean? And it was all done and on. It's not like,  you know, Oh brother, look, it's a porch monkey. You know, he's not saying that. I mean, I'd 
[02:27:30]  watch that one. Which cartoons are they getting rid of? That one, the one with the, the Al  Jolson, another one where he calls a buck tooth Eskimo, a big baboon. But that's, he called  everyone a big baboon. Get your hands off me a big baboon. You know, it wasn't a racial  thing. And who the hell calls an Eskimo a baboon? It's not a racial epithet for a Eskimo. 
[02:28:00]  So they're pulling those and any of the other ones they deem racially insensitive. Let's  go to Oscar. Oscar. Hey, what's up fellas? Hey. Yeah. Previous to this, they took one  during wartime where he was selling, where Bugs was selling ice creams to the Japs and he  was calling them a bunch of slanty eyes. Yeah. Yeah. You call them Japs. That's great.  And what do you call it? Now, are they going to finally admit to the fact that Omar Fudd  had a thing against homosexuals and blacks because he was always going to have to buzz 
[02:28:30]  when he was gay? That was going to be next? He had a thing. Yeah. I never know. Back  to you, Russ. All right, Oscar. Thank you. There you go. Taking it right back. Let's  go to Matt. Matt. Hey guys. The guy that's responsible for this is Jamie Kellner, who's  had like a reign of terror over Warner Brothers animation. He was the guy that canceled Batman the  animated series because it was too violent for kids. He's the one that told him to redo  the Superman series because it was too scary for kids and they couldn't sell it, even though  it was one of the best cartoons ever. He's the one that canceled Animaniacs and replaced 
[02:29:00]  it with that hysteria show. I mean, the guy's a frigging tool. He's done all this stuff and  he's destroying Warner Brothers. He's the one that sold WCW to Vince for like pennies on the  dollar because he didn't want, even though it made money for them, he didn't want it anymore.  I mean, the guy's the tool. He's the one that let Buffy get away. This guy's destroying the network.  Wait, Animaniacs isn't on TV anymore? No, because he didn't get it. God, that was such  a funny cartoon. It was kind of a blast from the past. It was cartoons the way they used  to be. Right. Because he didn't get it. That was the thing. He said, I've got an idea. 
[02:29:30]  Let's have George Washington with Pee Wee Herman voice and put him on there. And it was a stupid  history show that made no sense. People don't realize a lot of these cartoons were made before  a lot of people had television sets. It was made, they were the beginnings of movies.  You'd go into a movie, they'd show a short, you know, cartoon. A funny cartoon. They  were made for adults. Yeah, they were made for adults.  I hate this place. During, you know, Gone with the Wind. Before Gone with the Wind, you'd  see a cartoon as an adult audience. Right. Bill's got something to add. Bill? Hey, Bill. 
[02:30:00]  Hey, Bill. Joe. What's up? What's up? The one with the Japanese was actually called  Bugs Nips the Nips. The Nips. They called them the Nips. That's what they called them back  then. Sure, everything's hunky-dory now, aside from an occasional submarine that comes  up under your fishing boat. But, you know, back then, they were the Japs. There were atrocities  going on on both sides. And it was reflected in cartoons by clever writers that were writing 
[02:30:30]  stuff for adults. Now they're trying to pawn this stuff off on children, and they're butchering  it. And they're taking away the art that was making these cartoons. You know what I  mean? Devin. More censorship. Hey. What's going on, guys? What's up? Listen. Remember  Hair Raising Hair? The cartoon where Bugs, you know, puts the rollers in the monster's  hair? And it's dynamite. Of course. It's dynamite. It hasn't been on TV in years. They  don't blow up the head anymore. They don't blow up the head. They cut that out. I think it's 
[02:31:00]  because Bugs is kind of femme in that scene. You know? I gave up watching the Bugs Bunny  cartoons because, just like you said, there's a cartoon how you remember when you were a  kid. And the scene, like, you know, someone's head getting blown off or something. It's just  flat out not there. And it's a bad edit. You don't... It just jumps to another part of  the cartoon. It sucks. It's the funniest cartoon ever. And they ruined it. I'm pissed.  All right. I just don't like the idea that they get away with it under the guise that 
[02:31:30]  it's something, like, oh, we've got to be sensitive. No, it's not. It's history. How  could you not show history? That's like, you know, turn on a movie from back then and watch  some of the issues they're dealing with. It's the same thing. Just because it's a cartoon  doesn't mean it's for the kiddies. It's going to happen to Hollywood, too. The movies you  watch. Oh, yeah. You watch. We're always bitching. Where does it end?  You watch. Gary. What's up, ONA? You'll get some powerful people in place and they're 
[02:32:00]  going to decide, you know, no more gunplay movies because this has affected our society.  No more of this violence. How do they say... And they say they're doing this to protect  the children because the children of today are so effed up and people wish they could  be like they were in the old days when these cartoons were airing and stuff. When we grew  up watching them and, you know, people in the 50s grew up watching these things. But when  they finally made it to TV, you know, I'd be plastered down in front on Saturday morning  and watch every cartoon on television. There's a little bit of hypocrisy going on there. 
[02:32:30]  Because today the kids know that there are really talking rabbits who talk to their duck  friends and who have short little guys with mustaches chasing them around with guns.  Right. Gary, what's up?  What's up, ONA? I got a couple of valid points here. Remember the old cartoons where they see  something really whacked and they're like a fish or something will come out of the water  and say, well, now I've seen everything and put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  They don't do that anymore?  Uh-huh.  Or how about the old, like, Daffy Duck Porky Pigs when he was, like, really drawn weird?  He was really psycho?  Yeah.  And he was in the hospital and he was trying to saw Porky Pig with, like, with the hand  saw?  Uh-huh.  What, like, kids are going to go attack each other with hand saws?  Well, how about the Heckle and Jekyll cartoons when they call them magpies?  Yeah.  We all know what magpies are.  But they don't even do that anymore, right?  You'd be lucky if you didn't even find them anymore.  Yeah.  You know, it was a good one that they used to cut the ending out of. And the ending was  the whole friggin' cartoon. Daffy Duck trying to outdo Bugs on stage. And he finally 
[02:33:30]  does it with the drinking the nitroglycerin and gasoline, plutonium, and then he takes  the match and swallows it and blows up. They would never show him drinking this stuff.  They would show him come out on stage in the costume and then show him blowing up for  no apparent reason.  I'm surprised that he'd show him blowing up at that point.  I know.  They wouldn't show him drinking the gasoline because, oh, a kid might drink some gasoline.  It's like jackass, only cartoons. This is also happening with Little Rascals. That's 
[02:34:00]  why you have the Little Rascals episodes are too racially insensitive. It's called  history. You know? You don't look at it going, oh, wow, that's cool. Let's treat  people like this. Well, let's do this. You look at it and go, wow, this is a nice  little piece of history, you know? It gives a little insight on what was going on  back then.  And you know what? In a way, it was entertaining.  Rich, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  There was this Bugs Bunny cartoon where he goes, he's looking for like some  carrot country or whatever. And at some point in the cartoon, Bugs Bunny's dressed 
[02:34:30]  up as Abraham Lincoln. He goes, what's this here about you whipping slaves? And that was  one thing that they cut out years ago that I hadn't seen in a long-ass time.  Yeah. Jesus.  Yeah, there's many examples of this, Rich. Thank you.  Yeah, no problem, man.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, when Bugs is in Africa and he gets captured by the tribe of the, and they got the huge  lips on him and they put him in the pot because they're, because they're cannibals. You won't 
[02:35:00]  be seeing that.  Cannibals are black. I mean.  Unga, bunga, binga, bunga, unga, bunga, bunga, bunga, bunga, bunga.  Something like that, yes.  What'd I say?  And the funny thing is they won't show it, but meanwhile, Bugs Bunny isn't a person, so  he's a rabbit, for Christ's sake.  He's a rabbit.  He's supposed to eat them.  He's a cartoon rabbit.  He's fooled.  But if you could ever, I don't even know, someone should help us out with this. There  was a tape that was going around called, um, uh, band, uh, shoot, band cartoons or something 
[02:35:30]  like that.  Yeah.  Someone put the tape together of all the ones that are just not seen.  Yeah, I just, on TV. It'll shock you.  I rented a couple of those, uh, like two weeks ago.  It was called Weird Cartoons.  Weird Cartoons?  Yeah, and there were things that were banned and stuff.  A lot of, uh, a lot of sexual stuff from Betty Boop and, um, racial stuff.  They had that one.  It was called Lazy Town with the black people sitting around eating watermelon.  No joke.  Under the tree, taking naps, flies around their eyes.  Flies are buzzing around. 
[02:36:00]  Eating watermelons while, like the white people are working around them.  They scrub up, uh, the baby and then, uh, uh, they go to dry him off and the towel turns  black and the one guy, a black guy's sitting at a shoe shine thing, but he's got no shoes  on and the guy shines his foot really polished black.  It was, it was sick.  All right, we got to take a break.  We'll play What Did We Learn Next and wrap up this fine, fine radio show.  Yeah.  The Sports Guys. 
[02:36:30]  You give us sports with a twist.  Yeah.  Like hanging out with the boys.  Like you're hanging with us at the bar or on the corner.  It's very intimate, you know what I mean?  Not in a faggy way.  Right.  We're talking sports.  We're busting jobs.  Right.  This is a great show.  Wayne, your brother's never been more right.  By the way, what did that cost us?  Ah, just an O&A t-shirt.  The Sports Guys, mornings 5 to 9, 1027 WNEW.

Dead air spot.  Ah, every effing time it gets me.  What I want to say is I'm jonesing for some Java Deli from Planet Java.  And our shipment hasn't come in yet.  Oh, man.  I'm dying for it. 
[02:37:30]  Heads are going to roll, Ben.  I'm jonesing.  I like iced coffee.  Yeah, we love the iced coffee drinks.  My favorite is Java Deli.  It's low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  They also have the Caramoca.  And the one drink a lot of people are talking about, Tremble, Anthony.  Yeah, if you need a boost.  It's got a lot of caffeine in it.  The highest caffeinated drink in the country.  You get the idea.  Tremble.  It'll give you a boost, deliciously.  The wildest thing in town.  Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  Available wherever you find Coca-Cola products.

[02:38:30]  Opie and Anthony.  You dribbling puke.  Our former intern, Maritza, on the line.  Hey.  Hi, everybody.  Who got a paying job here at WNEW.  Yes.  Because of the fine work she did for us.  Which I love very, very much.  And this radio program.  Thank you, Maritza.  Thank you.  We had a fire Jesse today.  Or Ben fired Jesse today.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  He kind of really sucked on the first day on the job. 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  Oh, so then I can work with you guys now.  Well, we have a job opening.  No, we have a job opening.  That's pretty cool.  Or we could get you some more hours.  Yeah, definitely.  So what's going on, Maritza?  Nothing much.  I'm finishing up school, so.  Oh, guess what?  You guys know my boyfriend's leaving for Kosovo?  Kosovo.  Kosovo.  He's in the Army.  He's in the 340th Military Police Unit.  Nice timing.  Yeah, great timing.  Wonderful timing.  Aren't we done with that place?  No, we're not done.  And I guess people can't just get along in their own country. 
[02:39:30]  So why the hell do we have to go over there?  We.  Look at the we.  Why do we have to go over there?  Or your boyfriend?  Military police?  I guess to keep the peace or something.  I don't know.  Oh, military police.  They'll just be breaking up bar brawls between the rest of the American soldiers.  How long is he going to be gone?  He's already been in training, so he'll be gone until November.  Wait, what is he in?  What do you mean, what is he in?  What division?  What branch of the services is he in? 
[02:40:00]  It's the Army.  Military police.  He's in the Army.  Yes.  Reserves?  Yeah, now he's active.  They made him active, though.  This is pretty serious.  Yeah, they activate you.  Yep.  Oh, and he's got to go to Kosovo.  Yep.  So, wow, there's some hot, horny girls over there.  No, don't say that.  There are some girls that haven't seen, like, men, because a lot of their men got killed.  No.  So, there's a hell of a lot of women over there.  Yeah, most of them are, like, just walking the streets homeless because their apartments 
[02:40:30]  were bombed.  Are you serious?  And they're just looking for a peg to jump on.  And they love military guys.  They love American soldiers over there.  Oh, no.  You guys, see, I was worried before he would get hurt.  Now I'm just worried that some...  Well, if he doesn't get hurt, he'll at least get laid.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Marissa, these girls, too, they're, like, model types.  Yeah, they're very attractive over there.  It's not like when they sent our guys over to Rwanda.  You mean you're cuter than me?  You're pretty cute.  Oh, no.  Very comparable. 
[02:41:00]  If you're his type, because they look...  A lot of the girls over there are the same type as you.  I've read a lot on the situation over there in the military, man.  They love to throw their web.  Oh, no.  A lot of webs being thrown.  Yeah, they toss their web every chance they get.  Yeah.  See, now I'm worried, because I know he has handcuffs.  He has, like, a huge...  Schlong.  Yeah.  No, no.  I meant the stick that they hit you with. 
[02:41:30]  Night stick, schlong, whatever.  MPs, too, man.  They got an in.  They're the guys that can go to the places that the regular enlisted guys can't really get into.  They have special passes.  See, now, he didn't tell me this.  They have special privileges that extend above and beyond those of enlisted men.  Oh, man.  He's in trouble.  No, I'm sure he won't cheat or anything.  Don't worry about it.  No, especially when you think maybe your life can end the next day.  You wouldn't, you know, want to live it to its fullest.  It's not like military men cheat when they're overseas. 
[02:42:00]  Seriously.  It'll be fine.  It'll be fine.  I don't even think there's been any stories about military guys, Army, Navy, whatever,  going to other countries and having sex with their women.  Nah.  Well, I mean, of course they're not going to print that up or anything.  It's not like there's a lot of, you know, kids roaming around the United States that  are half American and half Asian.  Nah, nah, nah.  And if our American men were plowing those little Vietnamese chicks, boy, those Kosovo 
[02:42:30]  broads are going to look like supermodels.  Right.  Oh, man.  I wouldn't worry about it.  I'm sure he'll write you every day and then a couple months will go by and it'll be every  other week.  And, you know, if you're into getting a letter once a month, that's cool.  Oh, well, I have you guys, like, come for me, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  We'll come for you.  Yeah.  You'll let, you know, you'll make me delete.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, wish him well live on the radio.  Yeah.  Um, wish you well, Andy.  I love you.  And, um, good luck to all the military people that are going to Kosovo. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Good luck to them.  Thank you, guys.  Bye, Marissa.  Bye.  Bye.  Happy hunting over there in Kosovo.  I don't think they're going to need any luck.  Nice.  Nice over there.  Nice.  We have a few minutes to play.  What did we learn on the show today?  Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I learned two things today.

[02:45:30]  They've got to give it up.  Go ahead, Doc.  Hey, guys.  Thanks for today's show.  I figured it all out.  Yeah.  It was Pedro Guerrero who killed Blake's wife.  The bullet ricocheted.  Hit Jess's building to cut the power.  And then the neighbors started complaining about the violence caused by the cartoons.  Thanks to O&A for that one.  All right.  Thanks.  Keep it going, Echol and Jekyll.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  All right.  Thank you.  Casino from hell.  I learned God likes his coke.

Today I learned that fart may equal funny, but Jesse fired equals hilarious.  Steve from Islip Terrace.  I learned that when you rent memento and play it backwards, it will play forwards.  Because when you watch it forwards, it is really backwards.  Got it, Opie.  Uh-oh.  Marissa's calling back.  I hope we didn't upset her. 
[02:46:30]  She's too cute and innocent for that.  Uh-oh.  Never mind.  She doesn't want to talk to us?  No.  I can't get her.  Get her to come on the air real fast.  Carolyn.  Yeah.  Or is it Caroline?  Caroline.  Caroline.  It's Caroline, Brian.  Caroline.  Caroline.  I'm real.  I learned that the C word is now an adverb.  Yeah, auntie.  We learned that on the Sopranos yesterday.  I loved it.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Don't get auntie on it.  Don't get auntie.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Today, I learned that Friday, the Wow Fan, or Wow Van, what is he?  I can't even write.  That the Wow Fans will go to Statford, Connecticut.  That's right.  By the way, I was with my brother this weekend, just kind of walking around and stuff.  Yeah.  He just started breaking out laughing because of your Brian Regan, mother-in-law, box of wine.  Oh, box of wine.  He says one of the funniest things he's heard.  Box of wine, isn't it? 
[02:47:30]  Oh, box of wine.  Oh, that's good, Brian.  Three rights make a left.  I want to go home.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned sometime you've got to walk your own.  Yeah, unfortunately.  I've got to...  Hello?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Just a quick question.  You guys wouldn't have any tool tickets laying around, huh?  Tool tickets.  Yeah, that should have sold down 30.  No, nothing laying around.  You know, you guys wouldn't be using.  You know what?  We might be able to get a few.  We might have to do a tool contest. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  We might be able to work something out.  Good.  All right.  Yeah, I'll be going at a tool.  Yeah, I'm going at a tool.  No, I'm really going at a tool.
