<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic, albeit crude and rambling, segment featuring Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton reciting the names of past Speakers of the House, embellishing their histories with fabricated and offensive anecdotes, including one about a Speaker arrested for selling feces-laced cookies at a children's event.  This abruptly concluded.

The show then transitioned to a voicemail from a listener filled with racist and hateful conspiracy theories about Barack Obama.  The hosts reacted with disbelief and exasperation.

The main focus shifted to a critical discussion of the inadequate response to Hurricane Sandy victims, fueled by anger at perceived political incompetence and inaction, particularly targeting Speaker John Boehner with highly offensive language.  Audio clips of Governor Chris Christie and Congressman Peter King expressing their outrage at the delays were played.  The hosts also lambasted the media's coverage of the disaster, accusing certain outlets of sensationalism and manipulation, citing specific examples from a CNN report.  This segment broadened into a general condemnation of the US government's dysfunction and perceived corruption, utilizing extensive expletives and derogatory terms, speculating on the upcoming Speaker of the House vote.

Throughout the broadcast, the conversation veered into numerous tangents including discussions about Jim Norton's radio advice show, artificial sweeteners, childhood memories (noogies and purple nurples), and further offensive jokes.  A caller or contributor named Stunty was also mentioned.

Another significant portion of the show involved the hosts' increasingly frustrated reactions to repeated attempts by a podcast host, "Talib," to promote his podcast through calls and tweets.  Opie and Anthony played audio clips of Talib's calls and podcast content, openly criticizing its quality and humor, and detailing a prank call Talib made to Jim Norton.  Despite interruptions from another listener's phone call, the hosts' annoyance with Talibâ€™s persistent self-promotion remained a recurring theme until the end of the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All aboard! All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show!  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  It's gonna melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker!  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  I've fired it three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking about cock and ball.  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  He's cocked.  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah.  Your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy on the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass, because it makes me feel like I have  to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful, but I just can't take them. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Jeez Louise.  Wow, I like the new open.  That's some funny stuff in there.  Or new clips in the open, right?  It makes me laugh and laugh.  Good morning, everyone.  Good morning, people.  Look at us.  We're already in Thursday.  This is crazy. 
[00:02:00]  I like this.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  How do we do this every week?  I know, last night I'm just, I'm sitting around, I'm thinking, tomorrow's fucking Thursday.  Yeah, it's a piece of cake.  And then when it is Thursday, I can say, tomorrow's Friday.  That's right.  Fucking perfect.  I think that's sadly, though.  There's been some radio we didn't get to do this week.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, Jimmy.  You go off and do more radio.  That's Jimmy.  How fun.  Jimmy was doing radio yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  I was listening on the way driving home.  You're very good, Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  You're very good at that.  You, you, you, uh, he does the, the advice show on Wednesdays after our show.  He does the, it's very, it's a different Jim Norton, too.  It's not like, oh, it's Jimmy from the Opie and Anthony show.  Like, you genuinely sound concerned, yet funny.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  I'm lying.  I don't care about any of them.  Oh, right?  I assumed.  You gotta give the illusion.  It, uh, no.  Did you care?  And it's interesting.  People's fucking dumbass problems are kind of interesting to, to listen to. 
[00:03:00]  I thought it was going to be a goof.  Like, I figured the whole thing people do.  Ow!  But they're.  Did they call it nonsense?  But they're, like, real.  Real, real situations.  Fuck yeah.  And some real emails.  I feel like, wow, man.  You know.  It's my responsibility to drive these people to just fucking blow their brains out.  Are you going to take on Dr. Phil eventually?  Oh.  Oh, I would love to.  I think I could do a much better show than Dr. Phil.  Yes.  I couldn't muster up the fake caring as well as he does, though.  Yeah, true.  I would slip through in my, like, I'd be looking at you and you'd hear, ugh. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  They would have to, they would have to turn your mic off as they're, as the person is  spilling their heart out to you.  Jim, you're going to lose your obese audience.  You can't, ugh, every time they talk about how hard it is.  Dr. Phil stinks.  He's terrible.  He really is terrible.  That guy and then the other doctor.  Who's the other?  Oz.  Dr. Oz.  Dr. Drew.  Do you trust a doctor that absolutely is so self-centered that he's had so much fucking  construction done?  Reconstruction on his face? 
[00:04:00]  Like who?  That Dr. Oz?  Oh, he has?  Yeah.  Like, his eyes are all, he's got that, whenever guys get work done, their eyes go all lopsided.  They don't have it figured out for guys yet?  They completely lose symmetry in their face.  Oh, look at him.  Look at him.  He's pointing at you.  I'm Dr. Oz.  Dr. Oz.  What's that?  We're going to talk today about colon health.  Yeah.  Oh, and the audience goes, ooh, and chuckles a little.  Oh, it's a laugh.  How many heinies was that finger in over the years?  As he points at you, hey.  That'd make a good meme. 
[00:04:30]  This is the finger I use.  Can I tell you, Dr. Oz had a good episode one day, though, about artificial sweeteners and  what it does to your bladder.  Oh, down the hall?  Give me a fucking case of it.  And he said it makes your bladder like, he had two liquid-filled pitchers, and he had  like a rubber squeeze things, which would mimic the bladder muscles, and he had a woman 
[00:05:00]  come up, and he goes, now squeeze that, and she would squeeze it a little bit, and  a little bit of liquid would come out, and he'd go to the other one, and he'd go, now  squeeze that rapidly.  And he would say, now this is what if you have the artificial sweetener, and she'd squeeze  it rapidly, and he goes, you see, that's how your bladder muscles move.  But it's like, no, you told her to squeeze it a lot.  Yes, what is that?  That made no sense.  That was a terrible demonstration.  He stinks.  But I've cut down on my soda now.  Oh, yeah?  Artificial sweetener?  Yeah, that's a terrible story.  I'm sorry.  It really was bad.  I know. 
[00:05:30]  I was going to just let it sit there, but if you couldn't acknowledge it.  I felt confident after my compliments, so I figured I'd tell a Dr. Law story.  So you figured you'd keep going?  Yeah.  Bombed.  That's funny.  I guess the Sandy Hook kids are going back to school today.  Yeah, they went to Monroe, I guess.  And I heard the biggest lie on CNN last night.  They said the media has decided, as a group, not to be there when the kids go back to school  today.  And I started screaming at the TV like a lunatic. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, you're lying.  Totally.  Finally, the town got together and said, fuck, we're keeping everyone away.  And there'll be long shots.  The media didn't agree.  Guaranteed there'll be long shots of parents driving in to the school.  Sure.  Or at least down the road.  Right.  They'll have something.  There will be fucking intrusions.  But for them to say the media as a whole agreed, that's such a fucking lie.  It's bullshit, because they were vultures when it happened. 
[00:06:30]  What, they all of a sudden fucking get, they got ethics?  Right.  And fucking morality?  Shut up.  And then another guy, I was doing his report, and I actually laughed and called him an asshole,  even though he can't hear me.  I love talking to the TV like that.  Because he interviewed, it was CNN, it was Gary somebody, he interviewed the daughter  of the principal that was killed.  She looks just like the mom, a whole fucking thing.  She's on the couch, she's got a mommy tattoo now, so she can remember her mom.  Really horrific fucking piece, right? 
[00:07:00]  And then he has to, when they go back live, make it hurt even more.  It's like, look, you did your job, you got her on camera, you asked the right questions,  make sure she cried, because that's what you have to do.  And then they go back to him, and he goes, and she's getting married in July, and her mom  helped her pick out her wedding dress.  And I just pointed and started laughing, and then yelling at the guy, I'm like, that's  what every mom does.  So that didn't need to be said. 
[00:07:30]  It was said to make it hurt just even more.  I'm surprised he didn't say.  That guy, yeah, what's his name?  Gary Tuckman.  Gary Tuckman, you're an asshole.  I'm surprised he didn't say, and her mother will not be at the wedding.  Of course.  Really?  She won't?  She'll be there in spirit.  In spirit.  And then, of course, the other knucklehead had to go, oh, that's really sad.  Yeah, of course it's sad.  We all know, if you're getting married, that it's a really big day for the woman and the  mom, especially.  Yeah, boy.  Those are probably the two most important people in a wedding. 
[00:08:00]  The groom doesn't mean shit compared to the fucking bride and the mom of the bride.  He ain't nothing, yo.  Yeah, they apparently have a school that was closed that was nearby, like about seven miles  from the other school in Monroe County.  And they renamed it.  What do they name it?  Well, the same name.  I guess they gave it.  I would probably get rid of that name.  Yeah, me, me.  If you're named Sandy, you really, really, at this point, should change your fucking name. 
[00:08:30]  I guess they want everything as normal as possible for the kids.  I read, I did read a, sorry, go ahead.  I'm fucking.  No, that's it.  Because you just reminded me of something.  Go ahead.  Yeah, so it's like seven miles away, and they're trying to keep it as normal as possible  for the kids there.  I guess a lot of the parents are going to be dropping them off, they're not going to be  taking the bus and shit like that.  Fucking mega security.  Not that it matters.  I mean, it's the old closing the barn door after the horse.  It's going to be the safest school in America, obviously. 
[00:09:00]  No, you remind me of something.  Someone tweeted, and when someone tweets something like this, you're like, fuck, why didn't I  come up with it?  And you get really mad.  Basically, someone tweeted, if in 20 years, whoever's named Sandy, you know their parents  had mental issues.  That's true.  Anyone using that name anytime soon is a fucking lunatic, a crazy person.  I thought when you mentioned Twitter, we were going to hear the voice. 
[00:09:30]  I don't want to overdo the voice.  No, there's the two voices on Twitter.  The regular read when it's a good one.  Yeah.  Because these idiots, I know where they're tweeting from.  They're tweeting from a pathetic place.  Yes.  In a basement somewhere.  They're absolutely doing nothing with their lives, but they're going to tell you what's  wrong with yours.  Boo-hoo!  He's got to give up some more of his money!  Right.  Oh, right, right. 
[00:10:00]  I know where they're...  You can afford it!  Like, it's really going to hurt you!  Oh, okay.  Yeah, right.  It's hundreds of thousands of dollars, people.  It's so ridiculous, and, you know...  And really, I wouldn't feel as bad...  And that's not a boo-hoo, but it's the famous not doing your share that drives people nuts.  Not doing our fair share.  I mean, if we're one country, then the 46, 47% of the people that don't pay anything should  pay a little...  Just pay anything.  People should pay.  And then the whole deal with, you know, where the money's going is more important to me 
[00:10:30]  than paying the taxes.  Look, the taxes...  If I decide not to pay them, I go to jail.  So I really don't have much of a choice in that fucking matter.  But you know what?  How about you spend the money that pours in wisely?  Yeah.  How about we spend it a little more wisely?  Because they're going to get about $62 billion, they're saying.  And you know it's going to be another waste.  It's just a waste of money.  You don't really see anything improving around you. 
[00:11:00]  No.  It's terrible.  You'll still have shitty fucking roads and shitty commutes.  Yes.  Paying way too much to go over bridges and into tunnels.  I know it's, you know...  It's a different thing, but I get it.  But I'm just saying your life is just shit no matter what.  They don't improve you.  It's all in the same thing.  Like, I heard the ex-head of the MTA wants to run for mayor.  Oh, God.  How the fuck do you give that guy any job?  Please.  That, like... 
[00:11:30]  You've done nothing but lose money.  In the biggest city with the biggest transportation system, public transportation system.  You have the greatest business plan ever.  Right.  People have to use your product.  We don't have a choice.  And how do you lose money if you have a business plan like that?  Right.  That's like if we set up right now, like, okay, anyone that passes our studio, you're going  to have to pay us.  You've got to pay.  And then, fast forward, we're losing money.  I'm losing money.  How is that possible? 
[00:12:00]  And then you get these idiots, well, because it takes this to do...  No.  No.  I'm sorry.  No.  The business plan is set in such a way that that should be, you know, a moneymaker.  Well, here's why, Opie.  Because we would have to put a rope in front, right?  A little velvet rope.  Okay.  So how much is that from Home Depot?  Well, no.  See, we're going to buy it from this guy that I know.  Right.  And I'm going to, because the money just pours in, I'm just going to buy it for fucking  800 times what I could buy it for in Home Depot.  All right.  And then a couple more of my buddies are going to come by and install it. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  And then I want to make sure it's okay.  So I'm going to have a couple more buddies watch it.  Okay.  And they're going to get some of this money.  All right.  So we're not going to make money right away.  Wait.  No, no.  We're out of money.  All right.  We've got to start charging them more to come down the hallway.  Wow.  Wow.  That's what we've got to do.  Are we going to make money eventually?  Probably not.  But they'll just keep paying it, so fuck it.  Are we going to have to put a new rug in?  And we'll make money.  So it doesn't matter.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  We're getting paid.  We're on salary.  We're in?  And bonuses.  We're part of the inner circle? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Do we ever replace the rug?  Fuck no.  Of course not.  Let it rip up.  And if they trip over it, fuck them.  Where else are they going to go?  Of course not.  Where else are they going to go?  But every once in a while, we will clean the carpet, right?  Every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  We're going to show that we're doing something.  What are they going to do?  Use another hallway?  It's fucking ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  The waste.  It's amazing.  The waste.  Man, I just watch when I go through those tunnels over these bridges. 
[00:13:30]  I'm like, the amount of money they're pulling in and they can't make a profit.  I'm sure you've done it.  When you're stuck in traffic and you're by the toll booths and you just, it's a crowd  of people at the booths and you just look and go, one, two, three.  I'm like, how much money is it?  I'm like, in the next two minutes, they're going to make a thousand dollars.  In no time.  Right.  In one booth.  Right.  It's, but they're always out of money.  That's unbelievable.  The whole world is insane.  We're fucking up this country. 
[00:14:00]  We have shitty politicians.  Everyone hates the Congress at this point.  This speaker is a cocksucker.  Oh, Boehner.  I've hated Boehner forever.  Boehner.  Boehner.  How great is it that Peter King is the first one to start trashing him?  First, Governor Christie.  No, Peter King did first, then Christie.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Then Christie.  Here's the deal, though.  Obviously, the Republicans were playing politics.  They fucking look at these states that are Democratic states.  As far as elections go, they don't give a shit about New York, Jersey, and Connecticut. 
[00:14:30]  So go fuck yourself.  Right.  Where's your Democratic fucking leaders to help you out?  But the problem is, then you've got a Republican like Governor Christie saying, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  And it makes him look really bad.  And it also proves another thing, that when aid wasn't getting to Katrina victims quickly enough,  it had nothing to do with race.  It has to do with a bunch of incompetent motherfuckers.  Right.  Because this is a well-to-do, for the most part, considered a well-to-do area.  Well, it's way better than the Katrina area.  And they weren't even helping them.  And when they said, well, I bet when a disaster strikes a white area or a more well-to-do area, 
[00:15:00]  that aid gets in there immediately.  No.  Because they're incompetent to everybody.  Yeah, I agree with you.  What a scumbag, this guy.  What just, what scumbags are they?  He didn't want to, so people know, he didn't want to put the vote forward.  Nah, two, what's two more weeks, guys?  Oh, how about the guy that doesn't have a house?  Two weeks is a long fucking time.  But he was forced to do the two weeks.  Oh, yeah.  Because he wasn't going to vote anytime soon.  When's the new Congress coming in?  It's all happening. 
[00:15:30]  A couple weeks.  Yeah.  But aren't they voting on speakers soon?  Isn't there a chance that they're going to kick him out?  I have no idea.  Is there a vote today or something like that?  No.  No.  Boehner's in there.  Boehner.  Yeah, there's some kind of, like, loophole or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a chance they could get Boehner.  How did they think that this wasn't going to be a problem?  If they just went, bah, we're going to push off the vote until after the new Congress comes in. 
[00:16:00]  Bah, we'll just push it off.  It's ridiculous.  New Congress starts today at noon?  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, okay.  I think it all starts, uh, yeah.  Damn.  Yeah.  So, do we have the Peter King audio?  And Peter King, uh, I'm a little off here.  He's a Republican, too, right?  Ooh, he's the master of macabre.  Oh!  Steven.  Oh!  See, I...  Man, I gotta tell you, I was telling him before the show, obviously a lean Democrat, but,  man, I would vote for, I would vote for Christy in a second. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  More people have to, like, stop thinking, oh, if I'm a Democrat, it's gotta be Democrat every  fucking time.  You gotta...  He's a real leader.  Yeah.  The only thing standing in his way is his fucking belly.  The guy's too fat to vote for.  And when you see him around, like, other people, you realize, wow, he is really fucking fat.  He's huge.  And he's got that body that it's obvious that he's not supposed to be that fat. 
[00:17:00]  Some people are just supposed to be fat.  I really believe that.  Yeah.  But he's got that, like, roundness where it's like, I think...  He's so huge.  I think you can melt that down a little bit.  It's all over fat.  Yeah.  Head-to-toe fat.  I can't believe I didn't get a picture with him when I could have.  I'm such a guy.  Oh, man, that is a good one.  I didn't know who he was.  He was...  Where was he?  We were doing Hannity, but he was doing an interview before I did a panel.  And we were just in the dressing room together.  It was me, him, and some other lady.  And we sat alone.  He's sexy.  He's becoming a star.  I know.  He is.  He's a huge fucking...  Well, huge. 
[00:17:30]  Because he's had...  A force in the...  He's out of Congress.  A lot of people have had it with Congress.  Pretty much America hates Congress.  You know what it is?  He's coming across, at least, like a guy that will jump party lines to help his constituency.  I like those guys.  I love those type of guys.  Absolutely.  We need not more.  We need way more of that in this country.  Yeah.  These guys don't give a fuck about the people.  They give a fuck about their careers.  It's their career.  That's a career.  I don't think this shit was supposed to be a career when you talk about congressmen and shit. 
[00:18:00]  Fuck.  And they didn't vote on the aid for the Sandy victims, right?  No.  But I also heard there's a lot of pork in there.  A lot of pork.  I don't understand why they do that.  Why can't it just be, we need aid, we gotta vote on this?  Why does it have to be like, okay, we're gonna add this and that.  And they start adding weird shit in there.  It's become business.  It has nothing to do with the actual...  Business as usual.  It's become such business as usual in Washington that...  But that doesn't make sense to me. 
[00:18:30]  It doesn't make any sense.  Well, they also know that you can't say no to it.  So they throw things in this way.  If you vote against it, they can go, well, they voted against aid for Sandy.  But meanwhile, he's not voting against aid for Sandy.  He's voting against this fucking garbage you're throwing in.  Yeah, they throw a lot of shit in there.  They do it because, alright, the fucking guy from Iowa isn't gonna fucking vote for this bill.  He hates it.  He's not gonna vote for it.  So let's throw in this subsidy for some Iowa farmers and shit.  And then he goes, oh, okay, these people love me. 
[00:19:00]  I'll vote yes for it now.  But then when Iowa needs the help, then everyone should come together and help Iowa.  That seems crazy to me that's how it works.  That's exactly how this fucking shit works.  And meanwhile then, it's not only Iowa.  The guy from Iowa that doesn't want to vote for it.  So he gets a little taste.  So he gets something.  Iowa gets a little taste.  Other states.  That's because Jersey, New York, and Connecticut need help.  Yeah, so he votes yes.  And then every other state has their fucking guy, and they gotta give them favors.  I don't believe it.  That's how this fucking shit works. 
[00:19:30]  It's corrupt.  The older I get, I just don't believe in this government, man.  It's terrible.  I just don't believe in it.  It's terrible.  They're a great reflection of us.  Of people.  It's pathetic.  Very good, yes.  Great reflection of people.  Greedy motherfuckers.  They really are.  What's in it for me?  They are an absolute blown up version of us.  Everyone just lines up, every senator and congressman, and goes, all right, what is in  it for me?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  What do you need?  Well, I need, you know.  Yeah, we could use some of our roads or our highways.  Actually, we need new manhole covers.  Yeah, we could use a few of those. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  All righty.  How much will that cost?  Oh, $10 billion.  All right.  You got it.  You got it, sir.  We'll put it on page 8,362.  No one will see that.  Oh, God.  Can I see the Peter King?  I don't know if I saw this little thing.  The master of...  Republicans have no problem finding New York when they're out raising millions of dollars.  They're in New York all the time, filling their pockets with money from New Yorkers.  I'm saying right now, anyone from New York and New Jersey who contributes one penny to 
[00:20:30]  congressional Republicans is out of their mind.  Damn.  Because what they did last time was put a knife in the back of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans.  Literally?  It was an absolute disgrace.  And Congressman King, I got to tell you, I felt that knife, too, because I'm from New  Orleans, and I suffered through Katrina.  We lost 10 family homes.  I lost all my childhood memories.  Boo-hoo!  I understand what these people are doing.  You're...  What about you, miss?  Please!  I'm going to ask you now, as of Thursday, you have to really like your Congress in place.  You guys have to start from scratch.  Why are you thinking about her? 
[00:21:00]  I know.  I hope that you can get this back on the books and get something, get a deal done quickly.  Yeah, I don't see how.  The reason I say that is, we're not in session next week, the following week we're in session  two days, then you have the presidential inauguration, then you have the State of the Union.  We're going to be into February.  And by the way, there is opposition among Republicans to giving the $60 billion.  They want to give us $27 billion, which is the money they have to give us anyway.  So last night was really the chance to get it through.  That was the arrangement that was made. 
[00:21:30]  We played by the rules.  We did everything they asked us to do.  Governor Cuomo, I was talking to him last night, he's outraged.  Governor Christie is outraged.  Mayor Bloomberg is so disappointed in what happened here.  And again, we're not looking for anything.  All we're saying is, treat us the same as everybody else that's been treated.  And why the Republican Party has this bias against New York, this bias against the Northeast.  Gee, I wonder why.  This bias against the Northeast.  They wonder why they're becoming a minority party, why we're going to be a party of the permanent minority.  What they did last night, it was so immoral, so disgraceful, so irresponsible. 
[00:22:00]  They're supposed to be the party of family values.  And you have families that are starving, families that are suffering, families that are spread all over, living in substandard housing.  This was a disgrace.  They are inexcusable, and they've had it.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm on my own.  They're going to have to go a long way to get my vote on anything.  Wow.  Wow.  That is a fucking devastating indictment on national television by one of your own.  Pretty good.  You very rarely see that.  God bless Peter King.  Good for him, man.  He's great.  Not sure if I believe in God, but it's just the right thing to say.  That's a good one. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Governor Christie went at it, too.  It's all plain politics.  I mean, obviously, you know how New York votes.  You know how Jersey votes and how Connecticut votes.  And when they voted Obama in the election, the Republicans tell them to go fuck themselves.  This is their go fuck yourselves, right?  Yeah.  Yep.  But then you get, you know, Peter King, obviously, is New York.  And then you get Christie's jersey.  So the Republicans in those states and cities and whatnot, they're going to want the money. 
[00:23:00]  And that's why you always hear, put politics aside.  Right.  Which never happens.  But it doesn't happen.  This is one of those, put politics aside things.  It doesn't happen.  And believe me, the Democrats are no fucking angels as far as playing games like this is  concerned, either.  It's across the board, man.  It's across the board.  It is.  It's terrible.  I'm not sitting here thinking the Democrats are the solution.  It's so busted.  It's so busted.  The system is busted.  Yep.  And I think America is finally getting sick and tired of it.  I hope so. 
[00:23:30]  Here's Governor Christie, another Republican, going after his own party.  31 days for Andrew victims.  17 days for victims of Gustav and Ike.  10 days.  Now, before he says all that, I mean, where does this rank, this superstorm that we had?  As far as what?  It's pretty big.  With devastation?  Like, as far as, uh, how does it compare to Andrew?  Andrew is a biggie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How does it compare to Katrina? 
[00:24:00]  Financially?  Or, you know, because there's, like, loss of life.  There's property damage.  Is it right up there?  Or is there an actual?  Fuck yes.  Huge.  Okay.  Huge.  For victims of Katrina, for the victims of Sandy in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut,  there's been 66 days and the wait continues.  66 days.  The wait continues to go on.  That just shows you that, uh, you know, it's just gotten worse, how they deal with this  shit.  There are still people out of their homes. 
[00:24:30]  Out of fucking their homes.  There's still people without fucking basic, uh, you know, power, water, things like that.  And this piece of shit tabled the vote.  Yeah.  This fucking piece of shit tabled the vote.  But, Jimmy, what's two more weeks before you vote again?  It doesn't matter.  There's one answer.  I would never say on the radio what that answer is.  Oh, of course.  There is one answer.  Yes.  And everybody knows there's one way to handle this stuff.  Oh.  Yeah.  I will never say on the radio what I think it should be. 
[00:25:00]  Of course.  But until certain things start happening, they will continue to fuck us.  They will continue to do it.  A sound tongue lashing.  Perhaps a bit more.  A good Indian burn?  Yeah, that hurts.  Yeah, so to speak.  Yeah, yeah.  A purple nurple?  A perpeza, kind of.  How about charley horse?  Charlie horse.  Those hurt like a motherfucker.  Did you guys call them purple nurples when you were growing up?  Yes, purple nurple.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that universal?  Yeah.  Okay, good. 
[00:25:30]  A noogie is universal.  A noogie.  A noogie.  Everybody knows what a noogie is.  I don't know why everybody knows what a noogie is.  Yeah.  How did you noogie?  Did you grab the head by the neck or by the crown of the head?  I would grab my...  It's when your pants get pulled down and you grab your ankles and you yell noogie, noogie,  noogie, noogie while things are happening behind you.  Okay.  Ours was different there in East Northport.  We come from an innocent time.  Right, right.  You grab the head and you put the middle finger knuckle into the head and you go noogie patrol. 
[00:26:00]  And do you twist or do you rub back and forth?  I think it was more of a twist, but it could have been either one.  I think either was acceptable.  I think it was like...  I did a rub back and forth because that hurt.  And then you finish off with a couple of just fucking jabs punching.  Noogies hurt.  I know.  Terrible.  And nobody was shooting up schools when we were growing up.  Nah.  They took their noogies.  Took it out with noogies.  And they took their purple nurples.  A horrible noogie today in the schoolyard. 
[00:26:30]  Terrible.  I guess a kid got kicked out of school, suspended or whatnot, for making a gun with his hand.  That's it.  And going pow.  That's it.  That's all it takes now.  Boom.  Out.  Out, motherfucker.  It's crazy.  You know, where's the fucking...  Where's the little line?  Because it was a little kid, you know?  Yeah.  He was just fucking around.  I used to bring toy guns into school.  It was like acceptable.  Are you allowed to do that anymore?  Just play with them.  Oh, boy.  No.  You used to...  Oh, just...  Toy guns.  Yeah.  You'd be like, for Christmas or your birthday, you'd get like your toy gun set. 
[00:27:00]  And you'd bring it in.  And you'd bring it into school.  Bam, bam, pow, pow, woo.  Yeah.  We used to play like fucking Vietnam on the front lawn and all around everyone's houses.  You'd just play war.  You'd go, bam, bam, bam, you're dead.  You missed me.  No, fuck you.  I don't want to be the Viet Cong.  Back, you know, in the 80s.  Shout out to the 80s.  My town adopted a lot of Vietnamese kids, so we didn't really know that.  Oh, wow.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, our parish. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Our church enjoyed bringing in the Vietnamese kids for the families that had the wombs that  were barren.  Oh, oh, oh.  So they would bring in the Vietnamese kids.  Did they assimilate nicely?  Yeah, what pissed me off was, you know, I remember these kids in junior high, they didn't  speak English, and they walked around with that damn fucking Vietnamese to English dictionary  or whatever.  On the iPad?  Huh? 
[00:28:00]  On their iPad?  No, they didn't have iPads, Ant.  Oh, Jimmy.  And you fast forward, they're now seniors in high school.  They absolutely spoke way better than myself.  On a roll.  On a roll and graduated way the fuck above me.  That's because they were given so much right when they were born.  Oh, that's right.  They were fucking refugees.  But they saw an opportunity, and they went for it.  They knew they were in a better place, and they walked around learning English.  Why can't people just take that kind of attitude? 
[00:28:30]  You would play Vietnam in school?  Yeah.  And the kids would be like, why are you playing that?  And he'd be like, well, it's the war we're going to get into in a few years.  Yeah, all we knew is I played an advisor.  I want to be McNamara.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That pissed me off.  Those kids got way smarter than most of us, too.  Not just myself.  Yeah.  Everyone.  They were pretty much like top ten when they graduated.  Learning machines.  Learning machines. 
[00:29:00]  I hear you.  More of Governor Christie.  Oh.  There's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims.  The House majority.  Oh.  And their speaker, John Boehner.  Wow.  Nice.  This is not a Republican or Democratic issue.  National disasters happen in red states and blue states.  In states with Democratic governors and Republican governors.  You state, you state.  We respond to innocent victims of natural disasters, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans. 
[00:29:30]  Or at least we did until last night.  Last night, politics was placed before our oath to serve our citizens.  For me, it was disappointing and disgusting to watch.  Oh.  Nice.  He was talking about him eating dinner.  Yes.  Disappointing and disgusting to watch.  I caught myself at trip number five at the buffet in the mirror as the people serving  avoided eye contact. 
[00:30:00]  Good for you.  Wow.  That is a fucking, another devastating indictment.  Yes.  Now, if he ran for president like that, would he do very well, you think?  Or would that piss off a lot of people?  Absolutely.  I think a lot of people want someone that's going to grab the old bull by the horns.  I hope so.  Oh, there's more to this.  Great.  It's very, it's, the Republican Party, by the way, is in shambles.  Fucking shambles.  And, and post-election, there's info coming out that, like, Romney didn't even want to  fucking run. 
[00:30:30]  He didn't even want to fucking be president.  Well, it's easy to say that.  Well, I know, but I can almost say it.  I would think if you got your ass kicked like he did when you had a weak president, you  would now want to spin it and go, you know what, I didn't even want it.  But there's so much.  Is that true, you think?  I don't know.  The way he ran, especially the, post-Sandy, he, it was very difficult for him to get in  the news.  And it didn't seem like he even tried.  And I know the news is very biased and it was very hard for him to even try to get in  the news.  But why would he try to get in the news?  But he just, you know, he went to fucking Pennsylvania. 
[00:31:00]  But why would he even try at that point?  Why don't you just go away and relax like the rest of the guys?  I guess you got to finish the game.  Yeah.  You know, you got to finish the game out.  Because you never know what the next guy is, what's going to come out a week before  the election or what stupid shit he's going to say.  Obama might have said something like cunt lips by accident.  You know what?  I, well, of course, never mind.  I was thinking you were talking about after the election.  I'm so stupid.  Oh.  I'm so stupid.  Because they heard it out there.  I got to fucking acknowledge. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  No one.  I'll tell you what happened.  I looked to my left.  Stump Brain wants to give us an update on Boehner's job.  And then I went back to you and you're in the middle of talking.  And I, I didn't realize you were talking about Sandy, which happened before the election.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Of course he should have done more.  Of course.  It was.  He should have done more.  And that's just, it pretty much like fractured the Republican Party during the election.  Right.  Before, during the campaign.  All of it.  It was, the Democrats were very united, of course, because he's the incumbent, with Obama. 
[00:32:00]  It was so busted up between the conservative right and the, you know, the middle of the  ground people, the liberal conservatives, the fucking fiscally conservative.  There's just too much shit going on.  And now, I think, since the loss, there's this just underlying funk in the Republican Party.  You think, uh, Christie and Obama palling around for the day really was, yeah, that hurt.  That was massive.  That was massive, right? 
[00:32:30]  Massive.  Massive.  Yeah, I don't think.  Uh, a massive blow against Romney.  And then Romney, what did he do during that time?  Exactly.  Nothing.  We don't know.  What was his main, major photo op there?  He did nothing.  Because that was a great photo op for Obama.  And they think about all that stuff.  And it seemed genuine, I mean, because Christie, look, he needs help for his state, and Obama  came, right.  Even if Obama just did it because it was a smart political move, for whatever reason,  he showed up.  It was a smart political move for Christie because if Romney had won as an incumbent, he would 
[00:33:00]  have another four years, so eight years.  Christie wants to run.  You think he wants to run now?  In 2016, so he would have to wait another four years if there was a Republican in.  Now, Obama's going to be gone after four years.  Christie gets to run.  You can say that it's a little politically motivated that way.  But I honestly think it's a byproduct of Christie.  It's not his main motivation.  It's a byproduct of the fact that he wanted help for his fucking state. 
[00:33:30]  But he is aware that it would certainly help his political career.  He knows that.  Everyone knows what's going to help your political career.  That was just a man trying to take care of the people at that point.  That's just gravy.  Yeah, exactly.  But gravy.  A little icing on the cake.  I really like Chris Christie.  I didn't like him for a long time, but I was wrong.  I genuinely like this guy.  Let's see how he spits out of the other end of a fucking presidential campaign, though.  Let's see the damage people can do to him in that forum.  Let's go to Stunty.  Stunty.  Good morning, boys.  Good evening. 
[00:34:00]  Mr. Brain.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  I'm good.  And congrats on the tapes, Opie.  Obviously, the videos from underneath the city were spectacular.  Oh, well, put them on the blaze.  I think we should.  Let's see the other one.  Shut up.  Yeah.  But you missed on the...  There's another one coming.  Shut up, boys.  Yeah, you remember Watergate?  I got a video that blows away the underground tapes.  I want to see it.  I want to see it.  Oh, yeah.  Well, come on over.  By the way...  Come on over, because I don't know if I'll ever post it. 
[00:34:30]  I do think Boehner gave Christie his delayed Christmas present.  I do think this was totally payback for the hugs of Obama.  Oh, wow.  The only thing...  But what about Peter King?  He fucked over Peter King, too.  Yeah, but you're never going to win New York in terms of an election.  Exactly.  You know, you're totally outnumbered five to one.  Jersey's really never in the mix.  So it was politically expendable for three days, because the new Congress starts today. 
[00:35:00]  They're sworn in.  Yeah, they have to rewrite the whole bill and present it, but it's already on paper.  So they just, you know, press copy and reprint, and it'll have to go through the new system.  So, yeah, it did kind of slow things down for a few days.  But the big deal is, Will Boehner loses his job as Speaker.  Yeah.  And a lot of people are saying that Cantor could do it, but if they choose to have a  battle for Eric Cantor taking over and getting the job and they screw up, Pelosi could be 
[00:35:30]  back.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We don't...  Oh, God.  Oh.  It's unlikely that the Republicans, as dumb as they've been...  I want to gamble that.  So what?  They're not going to take a shot at that, because can you imagine Speaker Pelosi with  the Republicans having the majority?  We'd get nothing done, less done than has been happening in the past four years.  So it all goes down today?  Yeah.  It'll all go down today, and then...  Well, do you think Boehner keeps his job?  I think he does, unless...  He's disgusting. 
[00:36:00]  ...unless something miracle happens and Cantor pulls together a new coalition.  He really is a despicable individual.  Yeah, at least he stopped the tanning.  He was orange last year, remember?  Yeah, I do remember that.  He was just a strange...  You want to make sure he looked good on TV.  You know what?  He is an absolute piece of shit, but fucking Pelosi was an absolute piece of shit as Speaker  too.  They all are.  Fuck him, fuck her.  Fuck everybody.  That's my quote.  You don't like Cantor, do you?  I'm a fan of term limits, but these guys will never vote themselves... 
[00:36:30]  He looks like a complete asshole.  Yeah, let them vote themselves out of a job.  Term limits would be wonderful.  Yeah, but they won't do it.  Why would they do that?  Yeah, let me vote myself out.  Yeah, but what is their argument, Mike?  Obviously, they wouldn't do it because they can't go, look, we're pigs, this is what we  do.  What is their justification for no term limits?  They say the term limits are in the hands of the people, that the vote is the actual term  limit, so that if the voter is denied the right to make that decision, it's really unconstitutional. 
[00:37:00]  Well, in a way, they're correct, but why are they for the presidential term limits?  Well, that's a great question.  Of course it is.  It really is.  I did it in Jimmy's voice.  Every time a Democrat gets elected, somebody proposes repealing the amendment and allowing  a president to run for, let's say, a third term, President Obama.  So they did it the first time he was elected, and it's a congressman from New York City,  actually, who keeps, I think his name is Soriano, who keeps putting forth the bill to repeal 
[00:37:30]  the 23rd Amendment, is it, that restricted presidential terms?  I think it was the 24th.  Okay.  I'm not sure which one.  I'm almost positive.  It was the 18th.  No, it was the 24th.  Whatever it is, they would love a third term opportunity for Obama, but they're not going  to give themselves any term limits.  No, of course not.  I don't buy that whole thing either, that, you know, it's the public's vote that is the  term limit, because you're only given, you know, the choices of the same fucking people. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, and I think this is actually the year you're going to probably see another run at  a third party, where you'll see that if they actually get it happening, and then 2014 you  have it take hold, and there could be a real third party candidate in 2016.  Well, maybe.  I don't know.  I hope so.  It's what we need.  The country's stupid.  It's a long shot, but there it is.  But that's a new Congress starts today, and you should see, unless a canter coup happens, 
[00:38:30]  that the Boehner will be back.  Coochie coup.  Canter coup.  That's actually a really good band.  Canter coup tonight.  Heard you, Jim.  All right.  All right.  That's Stunty.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, boys.  Happy New Year.  You too, buddy.  Happy New Year.  Show me the tape, Opie.  What?  Show me that tape.  I want to see the secret video.  Oh, the secret video.  Yeah.  It even makes Ant nervous, to be honest with you.  That is a crazy one.  All right.  I'll see you next week, buddy.  All right.  Later. 
[00:39:00]  See you next week.  What's that about?  Oh, what?  What is that?  Did he just say, I'll see you next week?  See you next week.  What did he say?  That's getting written down.  What is that about?  Why would you write that down?  That's juicy.  What do you mean, why would I write that down?  Juicy.  Juicy.  Juicy.  Yeah.  We got more, Governor Christie, just beating the hell out of Boehner.  We worked with President Obama and his administration and satisfied them of the urgent need of this  $60 billion aid package.  This was good enough for 62 United States senators of both parties to vote for this package. 
[00:39:30]  This was good enough for a majority of the House of Representatives.  It overcame all the factual challenges.  It just could not overcome the toxic internal politics of the House majority.  Wow.  Damn.  That's a motherfuckering.  Holy shit.  Has Boehner commented on any of this?  Yeah.  I think that they're going to rush it.  He's rushing it through now because, again, selfish cocks. 
[00:40:00]  And again, he's just typical.  He's just the guy that we're talking about now.  Yeah.  But all of a sudden he realizes that his own party wants to lynch him.  Right.  And he is absolutely.  When he said, when Peter King said, anybody who gives money to congressional Republicans  is out of their minds.  Now you're talking money.  Yeah, there are a lot of Republicans in New York.  Not as many as Democrats, obviously, but they are giving money.  And the whole country hears this.  He said that on Fox.  He didn't say that on a little local TV. 
[00:40:30]  That was a national news show.  And this vote going through is all self-serving.  It's not all of a sudden he got this whim that, oh, you know what?  It would be good for the people.  Every single vote is self-serving.  This is, ah, I got to keep my gig.  Every single vote is self-serving.  Yes.  We're learning that more and more these days.  Bunch of fucking pricks is what they are.  New Jerseyans and New Yorkers are tired of being treated like second-class citizens.  New York deserves better than the selfishness we saw on display last night.  New Jersey deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display last night. 
[00:41:00]  America deserves better than just another example of a government that has forgotten who they are there to serve and why.  66 days and counting.  Shame on you.  Shame on Congress.  Two months.  Shame, shame, shame.  Two months.  Shame on you.  But he's saying things like, you've forgotten the people you're supposed to...  Like, you know...  Two months.  That's a biggie.  Way longer than the other ones that he mentioned in the beginning. 
[00:41:30]  If you want to look good as a politician and turn on your own party, this guy...  I think people kind of like when somebody motherfucks their own party a little bit.  Hell yeah.  Because it's really rare and it's obviously...  There's obviously a reason for it if you do it.  Because nobody likes to fuck their own party publicly.  No.  It's kind of...  It's the rebellious thing.  People like that.  You know?  They like seeing somebody not following the party line.  Mouthing off.  Motherfucking the guy.  Makes you feel like you're yelling at your parents. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  That was a root-ree.  All right.  We should head to the first break.  Yeah.  I gots to eat.  I'm going to get my breath-fixed on.  Mm-hmm.  I need me some breath-fixed.  Some breath-fixed.  Some breath-fixed.  Got a guy in Instant Feedback, Jamie.  Just want to acknowledge him.  Oh, he's from Canada, though.  Well, I guess it would make this Instant Feedback even more crazy.  Oh, boy.  I would bring my shotgun to school so I could go hunting with my friends after school. 
[00:42:30]  Oh.  Yeah, you used to be able to, like...  They used to be shooting in school.  Like, there was classes.  No, they still do that.  Really?  Where?  They still shoot in school.  Where?  Classrooms.  Oh, well, see, that's different.  I meant sanctioned.  Oh, oh, oh.  Sanctioned events.  Oh.  Yeah.  FBI gun checks set record for the month.  A lot of people buying guns.  Mm-hmm.  There's Boehner and Cantor walking the halls of Congress. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, boy.  He looks like Bob Dole, actually, Boehner.  Bob Dole.  In the face.  Yeah?  Yeah, he does.  A little bit.  But he is really a hated guy right now.  Why can't they get Cantor in there?  Is he that vulnerable, or would he make a good speaker?  He's an asshole, too, though.  He just comes across like a complete douchebag.  They really...  It's very hard to find one of the good ones.  Who was the last good one?  Man.  I don't know.  Who have the house speakers been? 
[00:43:30]  I mean, Gingrich, O'Neill.  Tip O'Neill.  Tip O'Neill.  Tip O'Neill.  O'Neill is Reagan's guy, right?  Pelosi.  Yes, hello.  Who else did we have?  Who was before Pelosi?  Who was...  Clinton.  Clinton's.  I don't know.  Speaker of the House.  Oh, God.  Oh, I know who it is.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I just want to...  Yeah, I don't want to say.  Bill Tetley.  Wait, Jimmy wants...  Is Bill Tetley?  Yeah, dude.  It's just...  I come off to...  Sam, what do you got?  Oh, come on.  Don't forget Newt.  Newt Gingrich.  Of course. 
[00:44:00]  I said Newt.  Did we say Newt?  I did say Newt.  But you said Gingrich.  That's what threw us off.  Oh, okay.  We like to say Newt.  Yeah?  Will you give us a list of the speakers?  Give us a list before I kiss you on the lips.  Where's the list of all the speakers?  Why did you put the list of the speakers of the House?  Because you just asked what the Clinton speakers are.  No!  But you know we're going to ask for...  Oh, my God.  We want all of them.  Give us a list.  Going all the way back to, like...  All right.  The first one.  Why couldn't you have wanted to take a stripper to the fucking D fucking... 
[00:44:30]  And been like, fuck you.  Yeah.  All right.  Name the speakers.  What are you going to do?  Does anyone know the first speaker of the house?  That's easy.  Yes, I do.  All right.  In 1789, it was Frederick...  What?  Sherbert.  Muhlenberg?  Muhlenberg.  Muhlenberg?  I can't...  A Jew?  No, he's probably German.  Probably German.  And then you had Jonathan Turnbull, Jr.  Oh, God.  And then there was Frederick back in. 
[00:45:00]  Wait.  Frederick got back in again?  Yeah, he did.  Back in.  What happened was, there was a John...  Who was the second guy?  Trumbull, right?  The second guy...  Trumbull.  Mrs. Trumbull.  He had problems, so they brought the other guy back.  Oh, they did.  Trumbull had a thing.  He fucked up.  He got caught with a boy.  And then he was fucking a boy.  Is it great how you could slander people from the history?  What are they going to do?  They won't do anything.  Yeah, that guy, the second one, Jonathan Trumbull?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was fucking a boy in the ass, and they found out.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  He was a boy fucker.  That's why he never did it again.  Yeah.  And then we went with Jonathan Dayton, the first Federalist.  Yeah.  And then there was...  Who else?  Theodore...  Theodore Sedgwick came in, I think.  I'm just going by memory.  What happened to him?  Well, because what happened was, they were all happy with Jonathan Dayton, but he had  a heart attack.  He had a heart attack, and he dropped dead.  Wow.  When he saw the boy, that the other guy had been fucking...  Oh, that Trumbull was fucking?  He's like, his last words were, now I get it.  And he dropped dead on the floor of Congress, and then this guy stepped in. 
[00:46:00]  Jonathan?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Theodore Sedgwick came in.  Theodore was the first one that said, you know what?  Fuck the Whig shit.  Yeah, he's a Federalist.  That's what I love about looking back at history.  I love seeing the guy that goes, you know what?  Fuck the Whig shit.  Fuck the Whig.  Teddy Sedg.  Oh.  And then you got Nathaniel Macon.  Yeah.  Keep going.  I want to do the whole thing.  I believe it was first Senator Hughes that actually said, fucketh, taketh thine wig.  Nice.  And like grabbed it off the guy's head, and he started crying. 
[00:46:30]  Do you know the exact quote?  Lingereth longer.  Oops.  The exact quote?  Go down a little bit.  Man, I really was an asshole back in the day.  More than now is what I'm saying.  Man, that was hilarious.  The exact quote by Nathaniel was, wigs, what are we, fags?  That was the exact quote.  Nice.  And then that was it for the wigs.  Thank you, Nathaniel Macon.  And then you had Joseph Bradley.  What is that?  Of Arnhem, I guess.  Of Arnhem. 
[00:47:00]  Okay.  No one cares.  Then we went with Henry Clay.  Bill Clay.  Yeah.  But, you know, people kept saying that he didn't win re-election because people were slamming  him saying, Henry Clay.  It's very easy to mold him to do what you want him to do.  And he lost because it was such a good campaign slogan.  Boo.  All right.  We're into the 1800s.  They were afraid someone would have kiln him.  I don't understand. 
[00:47:30]  Is a kiln is a clay thing?  Yeah.  That's how you bake.  They cook the clay.  You bake the clay.  Oh, God.  You didn't have a kiln in your school?  No, I did not have a kiln.  Henry Clay.  Then you got Lang in Cheeves.  Yeah.  And then Henry Clay was back in.  Yeah.  Then we went with John W. Taylor.  Now we're up to the 1820s.  Johnny Taylor, yeah.  We're getting there.  Then we had Philip Pendleton.  I can't remember.  What are you forgetting?  Andrew.  I think Andrew Stevenson wasn't there, right? 
[00:48:00]  Andrew.  He's not until a little later.  A little later.  Oh, that's right.  Then Henry Clay again.  Johnny Bell.  Then John W. Taylor.  Again.  He came back.  And then you had Andrew Stevenson.  Holy shit.  Can we just scroll to modern times?  And then you had John Bell.  All right.  Look.  And then James Polk.  Oh, Polk was the president.  That's right.  We know James Polk.  Sure do.  And then there was Robert M. T. Hunter.  And then there was John White.  A lot of wigs, actually. 
[00:48:30]  And then there was John Winston Jones.  Well, you know what?  There's the wigs back then.  We're running going,  y'all, you got to vote for me and shit.  They were called wiggers.  Yeah.  The supporters were called wiggers.  Yeah, we bring back the wigs.  Then there was John Wesley Davis.  And then there was Robert Charles Winthrop.  And then there was Howell.  Oh, my God.  We can't read every speaker of the house on the show.  We're up to the 1850s.  That's crazy.  I see where the scroll thing is. 
[00:49:00]  And then there's Lynn Boyd.  They started using photographs.  We're up to the part where they started using photographs.  Oh.  Instead of those dumb paintings.  Yeah.  And then there was Nathaniel P. Banks.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy.  James Lawrence Orr.  Or what?  Then we had William Pennington.  Oh.  Jim, you want to take over for a little while?  No.  That was the first Republican, by the way.  William Pennington.  Back in 1860, we're up to. 
[00:49:30]  Well, after him, where's William Pennington, Galusha A. Groh got in.  Sam, I implore you to scroll to now.  No, we're giving everyone a history.  Yeah, what do you not want me to talk about Shulier Colfax after a...  Yeah, you don't want to learn today?  What's wrong with you?  Galusha A. Groh with the giant campaign scandal.  What was the scandal, Jimmy?  Galusha A. Groh, but your economy won't. 
[00:50:00]  And they got him out.  They got him with that one.  Are people loving this bit?  No.  No.  They're loving it.  All right, go ahead, Jimmy.  They're loving it.  Teddy Pomeroy came in.  Wait, what about Shulier?  I said Shulier Colfax.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  But then after him was Theodore M. Pomeroy.  He was known as Teddy M.  Okay.  And, you know, because he would bowl with Ralph Crouch.  I thought it was Teddy Oberman.  And then there was, you know, James Blaine came in, of course.  And then Michael C. Kerr.  Okay. 
[00:50:30]  Not to be confused with Michael R. Kerr, who was arrested for shitting and baking cookies  and actually selling them at a child's get-together.  Michael.  A child's get-together.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he was a...  And then you had Samuel J. Randall.  Sammy Randall was good.  Sammy!  Yeah, Sammy!  We liked Sammy J. Randall.  All pictures.  He did a lot.  Yeah.  J. Warren Kiefer?  Yeah, J. Warren Kiefer.  And, of course, after him was John Carlisle, who was a Democrat from Kentucky.  Sure, sure. 
[00:51:00]  Thomas Brackett Reed.  He was a biggie.  He really was.  Yeah, big, fat, bald guy.  And then Charles Frederick Crisp.  Right.  Oh.  I just can't do this anymore.  No.  Why?  There's too many more.  There's so many!  No, we're getting there.  No!  Charles Frederick Crisp, you said.  Thomas Brackett Reed.  Then you got David B. Henderson.  Now we're into the 1900s.  Are you guys really going through the entire list just to say Boner?  No, Boner. 
[00:51:30]  No, Boehner.  All right.  Then you have Joseph Gunny.  What?  Cannon, it looks like.  No, Joseph Gunny Cannon.  They're using a blue font, and I'm like 15 feet away from the computer.  It's like an eye test.  Champ Clark?  Yes.  Champ Clark, what happened with Champ Clark?  They used to call him Champy, I think.  Yes, Champ Clark.  The problem with him is he, back in, this is probably around 1920, 1915, was for gay marriage.  Wow.  And nobody back then was for it. 
[00:52:00]  No.  No.  No.  And so Frederick Gillette came in.  Wow.  And he ran.  He goes, we will not allow those queers to ruin the institution of marriage.  And people agreed with him.  He was the speaker for eight years, Champ Clark.  Then we go with Frederick.  The second Frederick on the list, by the way.  Gillette.  Gillette.  Gillette.  Yeah.  Okay.  The razor guy.  Nicholas Longworth was next.  Then you got John Nance.  Garner.  Garner.  Yeah.  Wow.  The RN combo is really hard to read from 15 feet away. 
[00:52:30]  Do you see that?  No.  Okay.  Then who?  Henry Thomas Rainey?  All right.  Look.  We're getting there.  No.  We can't stop now.  We're into the 1930s.  Please.  We started in the 1700s.  Then there was Joseph Wellington.  Help me out, Sam.  Burns?  Yeah.  Okay.  I want you to take over from here for a little while.  William B. Bankhead.  That was, what, 1936, I believe. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  That's correct.  Maybe he was to put money in his head.  Sam Rayburn.  We're not into the colored pictures.  No.  Bankhead, by the way.  Yeah.  What happened to Bankhead?  He had a little slit in his head that looked like a piggy bank, and they called him Bankhead.  His real name wasn't that.  Okay.  It's fun to improv on these names.  It's a challenge, isn't it?  Comedy gold.  It's a challenge.  Joseph William Maron Jr.?  Martin.  Martin?  Yep. 
[00:53:30]  Sam Rayburn came back.  Yeah.  Wow.  He came back in, huh?  Joseph William Martin.  It was a weird scandal.  What happened?  It was a weird rape-murder thing.  So he stepped down, and then Sam Rayburn came in, and then Joseph William Martin came back.  What?  When it got proven that he did not rape and murder the girl, that she did it herself.  Oh.  And then, of course, Sam Rayburn came back again after that, and then John William McCormack came in.  And going up...  What year are we up to?  We are up to 1970... 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, okay.  What are we up to?  Go back to that.  Where are we?  Where are we?  No, no.  Right here.  My God.  John William McCormack.  All right.  What year is that?  That's 1965 through 71.  Okay.  Carl Albert.  Right.  It was like 71 through 77.  Oh.  You know what?  We can end the list there, I guess.  All right.  1977 is good enough.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  What?  That's good enough.  Yeah.  I think people are sick of this.  Yeah.  We made it up to 1977.  That's close enough.  Yeah.  It's just...  What?  I mean, none of those names.  Maybe just one name that you mentioned I recognize.  Polk?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I think they're sick of the list, and we made it to 1977.  Yeah.  We already said Tip O'Neill, and then blah, blah, blah.  That's fine.  Okay.  I'm done.  All right.  Let's go to break.  All right.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM. 
[00:55:00]  And about me sounding like a white supremacist over the past week or so since Obama was elected,  I'm seeing things that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my imagination.  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  I'm hearing all about the two names.  Come on.  Now, I've been listening on the radio to what's going down on the O&A show.  Obama's got Anthony's tickets in a twist. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  There's something about the tax and the guns in the stairs.  Wow.  Guessing to bet they're going to take Anne's guns away.  Robbing the rich or the black man's batting down.  Wow.  That's just crazy if you think for a second.  Yeah.  Now, why the fuck would I want Anthony's check?  Unless I'm getting a Shelby that you get to smell me.  Wow.  Sweet radio show.  Yeah, that would sell me if the am I getting paid, and go buy my president now.  That's right.  Well, I'm going to take Anne's money and give me all my things.  You're right.  I'm not taking this crap.  I'm going to take Anne's money and give it all up to me. 
[00:56:00]  We're going to move on.  I'm not taking this crap.  We're going to move on.  We're moving on.  I'm going to take Anne's money and give it all up to me.  That's what you do.  You're a high-profile radio host.  Dude, I can't take this anymore.  I can't take it.  It's the United Negro.  Call me a bond.  A chicken every bad nut.  Yeah.  So turn in your guns for the common brain.  Turn the Starbucks for the ring soda machine. 
[00:56:30]  Gonna get me fired to punch it in.  And Anthony's gonna have to take it on the chin.  I'm bumping in the crackers at Dosted Clear.  It's the black man's time for a terror and fear.  Don't worry about the mortgage or paying your rent.  Obama's got your back because he's heaven sent.  And when he's done improving my life, I'm gonna have more money than it's actually worth it.  I'm not joking.  This is what we're dealing with.  I'm gonna take his money and give it all up to me.  And in this country, you've been allowed to voice that opinion 
[00:57:00]  and then have a dialogue about it with other people who disagree with that opinion.  That's great.  It's a great thing.  But we've gotten to this point where you just can't do that anymore.  It's, um, it's, no.  Hey, Obama president.  Nah.  That's what the president's gonna do for you?  Now you can walk in front of white people's cars.  I'm sick of it.  You need a baby aspirin or something?  Shut the F up.  I was blind, but now I see. 
[00:57:30]  Obama president, nah.  Serious.  Serious.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Show.  Show.  Way to go, E-Rock.  I like this.  Is this in a movie? 
[00:58:00]  Is this in a movie?  Forest Gump.  Oh, that's right.  A lot of Vietnam stuff.  Yeah.  Very good. 
[00:58:30]  Who does this again?  Norman Greenbaum.  Ah, Norman Greenbaum.  Norman Greenbaum.  Unless you want the remake.  Who did the remake?  Doctor and the Question Marks from the 80s.  Oh, sure.  Let me hear that.  He's an angel, not a saint.  John Gibraltar is Michael.  Oh, yes.  Doctor and the Question Mark.  This is the original?  No, this is the remake. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, this is the remake.  Yeah.  Oh, Doctor and the Medics.  Sorry.  Doctor and the Medics.  Okay.  Doctor and the Medics.  Wait, who?  What band had the question mark in their name?  I think that was a 60s band, though.  Question Mark and the Mysterians?  Something like that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And what do they sing?  Let me sing.  Hang on.  Do you remember Question Mark and the Mysterians, I think?  Not really.  You'll know the song.  I would know the song, I'm sure.  What song do they sing?  I'm looking.  Hang on.  Give me a listen.  I'll tell you. 
[00:59:30]  No problem.  96 Tears.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  They did 96 Tears, Ant.  Ah.  96 Tears.  Cry, cry, cry.  Cry, cry, cry, cry.  Cry, cry, cry.  Yes, with that groovy 60s organ.  I like that, though.  I like a good organ.  Get it?  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  We're your feel-good station.  That's a...  Is that the Moog?  The Moog?  No, I think that's a...  No, it's like the big fucking organ.  A Hammond.  A Hammond B3.  With the spinning wheel?  Leslie Cabinet.  Yeah.  I sat behind Greg Allman at the Beacon Theater when the Allmans came into town and it had that  big spinning thing?  What?  That's how they got that?  Oh, man. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  His fucking organ or whatever the fuck he was playing was ancient.  Yeah.  Look at that hipster out there.  Troy's got a pom-pom hanging from his head.  What's going on?  The hand is now...  Did he just graduate from somewhere?  Oh, Jesus.  Huh?  What?  You mean because the tassel is down?  Did I fuck it up? 
[01:01:00]  I meant tassel.  God damn it.  That's the joke.  And I thought...  No, you said, did he just graduate?  Yeah, but I said pom-pom instead of tassel.  Oh!  Of course it's a tassel.  It's a tassel.  Fuck!  Don't tassel me.  I almost had line of the day.  Sorry.  Man.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  Still make fun of Troy.  You'll make the bloopers bloops and blunders real.  I will.  Let's say tassel.  Fucking bummed out.  I had it.  He's going around with the hair that... 
[01:01:30]  It's a tassel.  It's like that South Park episode where they had the emo kids.  Right.  Yeah.  He's like one of the emo kids.  Takes balls to walk around like that.  He keeps flipping his hair out of his eyes.  Oh, fat Jimmy.  What happened?  What's going on?  I don't know.  I just saw some fucking...  What's going on?  Some hot stir.  Oh, I didn't even see.  From Fox News or something.  Peter, Congress has ended, so we have to start all over in the next Congress.  And I just felt at the time, and there was nothing planned here, it was impromptu, that  we needed a form of shock treatment, because we just treated this as another political 
[01:02:00]  issue.  Ah, he's backing down slightly.  Is he?  Yeah, because he knows they're going to now vote on it.  Ah, yes.  He's now trying to explain why he was so harsh.  Well, you've got to be cruel to be kind.  In the right measure.  Yeah, but now he'll start wanting...  Well, you know, if you want to give money to Republicans, you know, it's understandable.  Yeah.  If you want to give money, that's cool.  Peter King, irate.  Is he irate?  He was irate. 
[01:02:30]  Sackling.  Do we have...  Stuck in my head now.  Do we have...  Yes, we do.  ...baby crying sounds?  I wish I did.  Do you have baby crying sounds?  E-Rock.  I'm looking hang out.  Oh, E-Rock.  Jimmy's up to son-in-law.  He needs baby crying sounds.  Just take E-Rock's sandwich away.  There we go.  Here's a tweet.  What the fuck, you sensitive fag?  Why did you block me? 
[01:03:00]  It's towel head radio, dude.  You can't take a joke.  What's towel head radio?  Exactly.  To the fucking...  Wait, but he said it's...  What does that mean?  There's a guy, and I will address you directly, because there's always this weird thinking,  do you mention the person?  But in this case, I have zero worry that people will go and listen to the show and then not  listen to this one.  Go and listen to it if you like it.  I've already blocked it.  What is it?  I don't even know what it is or where it's at. 
[01:03:30]  I guess it don't matter.  He's a guy who does, I guess, a podcast, which I've never heard.  Everyone's doing podcasts.  Who has been begging to be noticed.  Pleading.  Pleading to be noticed.  Right.  And, dude, I'm going to explain to you why I blocked you.  If you're listening.  Does he tweet us?  Yes.  Yeah, I blocked him already, because he was so...  Just annoying.  You're annoying.  Yeah.  You're not offensive.  You're not shocking. 
[01:04:00]  No.  You're annoying.  Because he likes to believe that he's blocked because, oh, you can't take it.  No, it's not an issue of not being able to take it.  I block, like, annoyances like I swat a fly away.  Because what he tweeted, this is, go back to his Twitter, and I did block him, and here's why.  He tweeted something, I don't know who's least important, and it was me and the actor Jim Norton.  Right.  Fine.  Yeah, whatever.  But I saw it in my at mentions 30 times because he's so desperate to be noticed. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  He's Twittering everybody the same thing.  That's not offensive to me.  I get the joke.  What do you mean I'm not important?  Jesus Christ.  It's annoying.  Do you really think, uh-oh, boy, this guy really took off the gloves.  Block.  You're not a fucking frightening, devastating force.  No.  It was irritating to see the same cornball joke, 30 fucking... 
[01:05:00]  How desperate are you?  Begging for retweets.  Begging.  Yeah.  And let me tell you something.  What?  You think you're the only one who can make fun of celebrities, but I can't?  What?  I have never...  If you notice, I almost never directly at mention celebrities.  I have done it, but very rarely do I do it.  And it's never begging for a retweet or to be noticed. 
[01:05:30]  And then he calls in my Wednesday show with some awful joke, and I nailed him with, uh, could  you say that again?  Oh, this tells me your sister.  Dude, it's not offensive.  It's not upsetting.  Like, oh, God, this guy.  Oh, get him away from me.  He's crazy.  Right, right.  He's crazy.  You're not crazy.  You're fucking...  You're not offensive.  It was just irritating.  It just gets to the point where it's fucking annoying.  I got so many tweets that were just like, oh, you know, you got a break. 
[01:06:00]  Why don't you give me a break and retweet me or something?  Oh, you're the only guy that should be doing radio or anything.  I was like, ugh.  Who the fuck are you?  You needy cunt.  Bam.  Gone.  Let's go to his Twitter.  You want people to like you and go see what you do?  You have to be entertaining.  Twitter is a vehicle for plugs, but you can't just plug.  Just plug, right.  It's part of it, but you can't just do it.  Okay, let's see his last tweet, which happened three hours ago. 
[01:06:30]  New podcast episode up, and then he puts his iTunes address.  The next one, to some girl, you are ugly.  And then the next one, I talk to an Israeli real estate broker and get into a funny altercation.  That's his tweet.  Ew.  And then he writes...  What?  That's a bit he did?  Then he tweets at Opie and at somebody else.  New podcast up with pranking real and talking to a Russian escort.  It's all plugs.  Nobody wants to see all of your plugs. 
[01:07:00]  Ugh.  Why don't you call in, dude?  You have the number.  Why don't we play one of his bits, if it's so good?  I've never listened to him.  He might be great.  He might be awful.  I don't care.  What's the Israel one?  Yeah, let's hear the Israel one that he plugged.  And if it's great, we'll say it's great.  I'm listening through one of his episodes, because on the description it says he discusses being on the Jim Norton show.  Oh, he discussed that.  Oh, good.  Did he play the plug?  I mean, the thing is an hour long, so I'm just kind of picking through it right now. 
[01:07:30]  A prank call to Jimmy is worthy of him doing an entire podcast on it.  But yeah, again, your prank wasn't offensive, but it wasn't a good prank.  I fucked your fist.  Really?  That's what he said?  But literally, I can't picture myself calling a performer and just doing that.  And just doing that.  And then going, huh?  Ah, right, ah!  I've Ramoned enough people, but I don't then go, why are you mad at me for Ramoning you? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, look who's here.  What are you doing?  Travis.  Hi, Travis.  Hi, Travis.  I was running the board when he called during your show.  Right.  And then he called back 12 more times.  Holy shit.  For what reason?  By the way, he's now getting publicity.  You know that, right?  Absolutely.  Give him the publicity.  Let him have it.  Because he'll make nothing of it.  And if he's good, people will listen to it and love him.  I never mind that if, because it's getting to a point where, I could just block your other name, dude.  It's not upsetting, but it's irritating when somebody thinks that you're such a force to be. 
[01:08:30]  I've invited you to call in.  Jesus.  So pick up the fucking phone.  You have the number.  It's the same as the number I give out, right?  He's crazy, Jim.  You just can't see, you just can't think up an answer for him, because he's so crazy and wild.  He's so, this guy's dangerous.  Oh, look out.  And then he tweets, subscribe to my podcast.  The guy that brought down Jim Norton, Opie and Anthony, Bill Burr, and Joe Rogan.  Like, what?  Who wants to, like, what does that mean?  Did you see that tweet?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I definitely saw that tweet.  What does that mean? 
[01:09:00]  Exactly.  What does that mean?  Who are you trying to get to help you?  You're not going to be such a wild guy that we all go, oh, my God, wild guy coming through.  I've had shit in my mouth.  You're not a frightening force.  Give a fuck about you.  Yeah.  I haven't pre-listened to the whole clip.  I just know that he's talking about you here.  Yeah, I have not heard this either.  Okay, I haven't heard it yet.  Well, volume, and we're on.  Let's hear it.  With that video she made, what the fuck, man? 
[01:09:30]  Like, what else apart from what she's done?  Like, what is it?  Is that it?  Like, what am I supposed to, like, what is her skill?  What is her talent?  Like, what does she do with a cunt?  Can you pause this?  Is she a singer or an actor?  What does she do?  I wouldn't listen to this.  It's horrible.  No, no, you can't even barely understand what he's saying.  He sounds British.  What is he?  Sounds British, but like Hispanic British.  I guess he's Arab, because he tweeted about another one.  And he writes, war it is, towel, oh, no, oh, I've been talking shit about arrows some 
[01:10:00]  years, and now I show my true color.  He's wild, Jim.  The fact that you are delusional to how annoying you are is what bugs me.  Sometimes annoying is good, no?  It can be if it's funny.  In the right measure.  Believe me, it's not, but I don't find him to be.  Follow-up hit?  I'm reading his Twitter.  Yes.  And it wasn't like, wow, these are great.  Dude, your capital letters, what does that mean? 
[01:10:30]  You're angry?  It is valueless.  Look out.  I've invited you to call in three times, and you just tweeted 17 minutes ago.  So call in.  So pick up the fucking phone and call in.  Well, Jimmy, if you can't fucking stand the heat, you know, maybe you should get out of  the kitchen.  Let's hear what he has to say.  This fella.  Who gives a fuck about these coasters, man?  And that's the mainstream media.  That's what, you know, that's what the fucking masses apparently want.  And we do our thing, you know what I mean? 
[01:11:00]  We talk shit.  We go fuck.  And we get shut down.  So.  But yeah, so I was on the phone, and I was like, fuck it, man.  I'm just going to hang up, man.  I don't even want their phones.  You know what I mean?  If you listen to TMZ or whatever, fuck that shit, man.  I don't give a fuck.  Is this another language?  Well, I don't know.  But yeah, this week as well, I was, or last week actually, I was on the Jim Norton show.  I actually play the clip right now.  What happened?  I told Jim Norton was doing his advice show, and I thought I'd be, you know, kind of cute 
[01:11:30]  to fucking, you know, call in and, you know, give Tide Radio a shout out or whatever, and  I'll let you hear it.  But the dude played me, you know, pretending he couldn't hear me and shit, fucking Jim Norton.  You know what I mean?  Jim Norton is one of the funniest motherfuckers.  Oh, all right, you know what?  Pause that for a second.  Oh, fuck.  I mean, all right, you know.  You just turned Jimmy around.  Listen, Talib.  You just turned Jimmy around.  Listen.  You're not a bad guy.  That's all it takes.  That's all it takes.  You're in a quandary now. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, my God.  No, I'm not in a quandary, but I tell you, it's still very annoying to have the same thing  tweeted at me 30 fucking times.  This psychopath.  His tone has changed.  You know what?  Because I'm trying to help this guy.  His tone has changed for real.  Why?  The guy.  He's a, you know what?  He's a guy who's not a bad guy.  He just.  He's one of these guys who's trying to make his way. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  And he needs a hand.  I know Jimmy's trying to turn it into a bit, but he really changed his tone.  You can tell.  He's like, all right, all right, all right.  All right.  Can I hear the rest of it?  I'm not as angry.  Can I hear the rest of it?  Well, who knows?  Maybe I'll say something that'll anger you now.  Maybe.  That's what I'm hoping for.  Wow.  Stand-up is cool.  It's kind of cool.  You know, I'm not really a big fan of stand-up.  So, I'm more of his, like, his off-com, like, his off-the-head, like, he's the funniest  dude I've heard.  You know what I mean?  Not a big fan of your stand-up.  His stand-up is not really my cup of tea. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, he does have some funny points he makes up.  All right.  That's fair.  But the funniest shit is, like, you know, when Patrice O'Neill, you know, used to be  on the show, Louis CK on the opening, Anthony, like, he said some funny shit, man,  like, off the top of his head.  Like, yeah.  But this is what happened.  I called the show.  I've recorded it.  I put it up.  This is what happens.  Listen to it.  Mental illness, and I'm sorry to hear that, but boot this fucking pig out of the house 
[01:13:30]  because she's making decisions to not take her medication or to mix booze with medicine.  So, that's my advice to you.  Stop coddling this fucking destructive slob.  Had enough of mentally ill people fucking it up for the rest of us.  And we have any phone calls tonight?  I'm hoping people call on the phones.  Yeah, you want to go to one?  Yes.  Let's go to Tony.  Hi, Tony.  Oh, Tony.  Is that the Tony I just read?  No.  Okay.  Hello?  Hi, Tony.  Yes.  Hey, is this Jim?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  No, no.  I'm someone else.  I have a different dialogue.  Okay.  Well, basically, you know, Tau has radio.  He's fucking your sister.  Well, apparently she's not into Arabs.  Well, did you affect her, man?  Is that what happened?  I didn't hear.  Dude, your phone is cutting out, brother.  I didn't hear you.  That's what happened?  Your phone is cutting out.  You didn't hear me now.  What did you say?  I got this girl that, you know, I've been trying to, I'm allowed to swear on her.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm trying to, you know, fuck, but she just, she said she doesn't want to date Arabs, 
[01:14:30]  you know?  Um, I told her, who your brother is?  She told me Jim Norton.  Oh, Jesus.  So I told her, what?  Can I put my phone in?  Dude, your phone is, your phone is crapping out.  Are you calling from a landline or a cell line?  Calling from a cell line.  Okay.  Slow down and pay attention and make sure that it's not crapping out.  You destroyed him.  Is it better now?  Now I can hear you.  Okay.  Basically, I'm trying to fuck this shit.  I heard you!  You dumbbell. 
[01:15:00]  Well, three times you said it.  You're plugging towel head radio.  Three times he said it.  All right, who's next?  I love when they repeat themselves.  Now, can we pause that real quick, Sam?  Oh, shit.  Now, to the towel head guy, did I seem angry after that or did I block you after that?  No, I didn't.  He set you up.  Even though you called up in the first thing he said. 
[01:15:30]  Meaning Jimmy set you up, you idiot.  Yeah, I made fun of you.  You didn't give a fuck what you had to say.  But, I mean, it wasn't like, oh, my God, he pranked me.  I'm blocking him.  You didn't even prank good.  No.  The first thing you said was, hey, it's towel head radio, which kind of was an annoying plug.  Yeah.  But I let you do it, and I even said it after.  I didn't block you.  Right.  But when you tweet the same thing at me 30 fucking times, it's annoying.  It's not threatening.  It's not, whoa. 
[01:16:00]  It's just irritating.  You can't take it, Jim.  Yeah.  Come on.  You can't take it.  So that is why you were blocked.  Because you were irritating.  And you irritated Ant, too.  And you've irritated other people.  Yeah, yeah.  It made me block you.  I, you know, if at some point you would have said something funny or tweeted something funny,  I would have retweeted it.  But that, that, just the, the needy desperation to be retweeted is like, no, fuck yeah.  The neediness.  Fucking 30 times with the same dumb.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  First one was fine.  When you addressed it to me, I didn't mind.  And if you did it to other people, it wasn't like I went through your timeline and went,  wait, what is this buster saying?  Yeah, yeah.  But you're at mentioning me every time, which means you want me to hear it.  So basically you keep knocking on me.  Hello?  Right.  Hello?  Yes.  Hello?  And then I closed the door in your face and you're like, what?  No one deserves a break.  You're closing the door.  And my, not one moment of understanding that what you did might have been annoying.  Let's hear his take on what we just heard because I, I bet you he thinks he got you 
[01:17:00]  even though you set him up badly.  Badly in a good way.  I got played, motherfuckers.  Okay.  Yeah, he played me.  I don't give a fuck.  You know what I mean?  It's funny though.  You know what I mean?  We got the plug.  You know, I don't know how many listeners he gets.  I guess it's in the thousand, a hundred thousand.  I don't know.  But yeah, at least, you know, I'm going to call him again.  Don't tell him though.  Because I'm, I'm planning to call him.  Well, I suppose, we're supposed to have a show Monday yesterday, but it's Christmas,  I guess.  So I think I'll have to wait until next Monday. 
[01:17:30]  This is terrible.  Because I don't know.  Because I don't know. </pre>
