<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a self-congratulatory intro boasting their controversial style, followed by a recap of their successful Detroit comedy tour, including a lengthy post-show book signing and Anthony's casino adventures at Greektown Casino.  He initially won $40,000 but ultimately lost his initial $5,000 stake.  Photos of a "bulge" in Anthony's back pocket were discussed, clarified to be police business cards, not cash.  The hosts then covered a busy sports weekend: Barry Bonds' controversial home run tying Hank Aaron's record (met with indifference by the hosts due to steroid allegations), Alex Rodriguez's 500th home run, Tom Glavine's 300th win, and the New York Mets' apple-themed home run celebration.  They discussed the upcoming demolition of Shea Stadium and various quirky home run celebrations across different stadiums.  Listener calls covered the Detroit show, Anthony's gambling, and hypothetical robot baseball leagues. The show briefly touched upon the Women's British Open at St Andrews, with Anthony adding humorous comments about an abs infomercial and the physical challenges of golfing with large breasts.

The show continued with a discussion about a difficult golf course, segueing into a humorous tangent on woolly mammoths and their extinction.  This led to a review of their "What the Hell Is That?" contest, showcasing graphic descriptions and audio of disturbing medical conditions, culminating in the winning entry: a large, pus-filled cyst, which caused co-host Bob Kelly to vomit repeatedly.  The hosts then dissected skateboarder Chip Nance's X Games fall, sparking a debate on optimal falling techniques. Listener calls offered various perspectives and personal anecdotes about falling.  The segment also featured a discussion of controversial quotes by golf commentator Ben Wright, concerning women's breasts and lesbians in golf, with listener calls adding to the humor.  Finally, they briefly discussed Michael Irvin's emotional Hall of Fame speech and played audio from a hip-hop abs infomercial, concluding with more listener calls.

The final segment started with a story about a man’s life’s work being dumped in a dumpster, followed by a comedically disastrous movie plot involving death, an RV trip, and a childhood home turned tire store.   Audio from Michael Irvin's Hall of Fame speech was played again, criticized for its emotional tone, compared unfavorably to Mike Schmidt's speech.  A bizarre, emotional speech from a wrestling fan ("Wrestling Fan," later revealed to be Dave Wills) was played and heavily ridiculed.  Wills called in to explain his outburst, citing the physical toll on aging wrestlers and recent deaths in the wrestling world, also mentioning his website "itstillrealtome.com."  Audio from Andre Agassi's retirement speech was also played, highlighting its sentimental aspects. A nervous caller, Steve from Yellowstone, had a brief, interrupted call.  Further discussion ensued regarding Chris Benoit's death and the dangers of professional wrestling, with more calls from wrestling fans and continued criticism of Dave Wills.  The show then shifted to a planned paintball match against Adam Carolla's show, a listener's story about an arrest, the X Games, Tyra Banks' interview with primordial dwarfs (prompting a lengthy, humorous hypothetical battle scenario between a person and numerous primordial dwarfs), and a caller's story about her boyfriend's inappropriate birthday joke. The show concluded with a call from Doug Stanhope, leading to a discussion about Chris Hansen, pedophilia, and internet pornography, filled with darkly comedic and offensive humor.

[00:05:30]  and I'm like oh okay  so they're well informed  they read the newspaper  before they do their radio show  and then these people said  no  they read the newspaper  that's what they do  on their radio show  like on the air  they just  they read the newspaper  they read the newspaper  and for some reason  Detroit likes that  when you just sit around  and read the newspaper  on the air  I don't get it  and then we don't have  any ratings in Detroit  we keep it honest  on this show  we'll tell you where we're doing good  and where we're doing bad  we're not really tracking yet 
[00:06:00]  in Detroit  and our old  one of our old  assistant PDs  is now the big guy up there  and he knows  what this show could do  and  so we're not really tracking  in the ratings  but then you do the comedy show  and people are coming out  of the woodwork  to see this thing  yeah  doesn't make sense  any station  or show  that's doing really well  in the ratings  I'd love to see them  try to put something together  where they draw crowds like that  yeah supposedly  it was like 7,000 people  up there  7,000 lunatics  watching that comedy show  great time 
[00:06:30]  it was absolutely  a great time  but no weekend  for the boys  a little tired today  and then  Anthony's just an animal  because we finally  got out of the venue  I know we were heading back  to the hotel around  close to 1 in the morning  yeah it was about 1  1-ish  and the show ended at 10.30  so yeah I guess  it was a couple hours  of signing after the show  and we're all pretty tired  and it's like  I'm going to the casino  I'm going  that's the thing this summer  do the comedy show

[00:08:00]  but we were all exhausted  I don't know  where it comes from  with you man  well there's a certain  energy when you're  you know  right there  no  I was drinking  my wine at the show  but then once I hit  the casino  it was nothing  but club soda  that was it  oh you had a focus  right  no I just didn't  want to feel like crap  and throw up  the next day  especially on a travel day  I wanted to keep it nice  so yeah  me and Keith  hit the casino  that was it  went to one of the casinos

[00:11:00]  okay  just don't do it  people pick  pick pocket  alright so you go  to Greektown  yep  go there  and sit down  again high stakes  I'm a little upset  at the fact  that the  limit  the high limit  table  was $2,000  a bet  oh that's such a drag  that  yeah  yeah  $2,000  yeah I'm with you  now 
[00:11:30]  I like  something  in the  $5,000  $6,000 range  but this was  $2,000  but  I'm like  okay  let me sit down  start grinding  I sit down  like I said  I have a few  grand with me  and  start out  and  in a very  short time  I had  stacks  of $500  chips  amounting  to  $40,000  $40,000  $40,000  was in front of me 
[00:12:00]  so your winnings  are closing in  on  $200,000  dude  I was  destroying  right  again  playing  two hands  splitting  doubling  down  max bets  just maximum  betting  and  then  something  happened  I felt  a distinct  turn  in my luck 
[00:12:30]  but I thought  I could  ride it out  all right  so I had a  little dip  but I'm sure  you got that  back and then  some  no  you've been  on a roll  I had a  pretty good  dip  let's say  then  I changed  tables  all right  and  started bringing  it back  started coming  back  wait you

[00:13:30]  but  I didn't  I wanted to  you know  at least get  the $40,000  back  probably bring  it up to $50,000  and then leave  did you have  a number  you wanted  to bring  it up to  yeah  probably $50  would have  been it  because you're  thinking  okay  this will  bring my  winnings  to $200,000  I like a nice  even number  a nice even  number  like even  numbers  for the comedy  tour this summer  yeah  alright  what happened  I had stacks  stacks of $500  chips in front of me  um  well  I wound up  walking out  of that casino  come on  give me the number  give me the number

[00:16:00]  on my  dealt out 17  that dealer's got  like a 4  showing  dealer's got  like a 4  showing  I'm like  I'm in  that's good  turns over  a king  it's like  14  nice  next card  bam  7  like what  where's your  picture card  to break  it was the  unbreakable  dealer  that I hit  and it was  just  nothing was  working for me  and I went  through that  in no time 
[00:16:30]  and then just  went you know  something  get me the  hell out of  here  but the casino  was kind  enough  to give me  and Keith  a limo  to get us  the hell  out of there  oh really  yeah  I thought  the van  was waiting  for you  nope  they were  very  appreciative  that I  had not  taken their  money  and  they took  a little  of yours  that was it  took some  of mine  threw us  in a limo  and drove us  back to the hotel  where I  got into the room  and my  girlfriend's there 
[00:17:00]  and she goes  hi baby  how'd you do  and I'm like  um  she goes  oh  okay  go to sleep  no stories  of conquest  and victory  from the front  just stories  of defeat  but then he  took a king  and a seven  and a four  what was I  to do  what am I  gonna do  yeah I'm  gonna explain  it  and then there  was one hand  my god  I thought  I had it  so what  are we at  now with you 
[00:17:30]  because everyone  wants to know  it was 150,000  you were up  that I dumped  about  dumped about  five  I dumped  a little  over five  all right  so you're  still in  really really  good shape  I'm still  I'm still  doing good  yeah  I think  next stop  is  next stop  is DC  gotta find a casino  in the Washington  DC area  the only gamble  in DC  is walking  the streets  at night  I don't want  to play that  game  their own  game in  Washington  DC  yes  try to make  it from  point A to 
[00:18:00]  point B  with your  life  no I  I think  next stop  might be  a nice  Caribbean  adventure  with a casino  oh boy  we'll give that  a whirl  I've read  about those  back rooms  man  oh no  I've read  about those  back rooms  they don't like  when you take  their money  no no no  no  they're not  gonna be  offering limos  and private  jets down  there  find you  behind the  rocks  somewhere  off the  beach  oh yeah  oh yeah  the guy  that sells  you coconut  drinks 
[00:18:30]  during the  day  with a  smile  yeah  that breaks  your head  open like the  top of the  coconut when he  makes a drink  out of it  dude man  you're crazy  to gamble  high stakes  in the  Caribbean  that'll be  great  they got some  different laws  down there  their own laws  they see the serpent  in the rainbow  oh no  creepy movie  about Haiti  where the guys  who are like all  the witchcraft  and stuff  you're out of  your mind  to deal with  those people  oh is that  what they're  gonna do  yeah  they heebie jeebie  on me  they don't take  kindly to the  high stakes  we'll see  yeah  all right  we'll see  well the gambling 
[00:19:00]  thing continues  that's  so you did  all right  you know  you did lose  40 g  no no  you lost  40 g  you did not  lose 40 g  I made 40  thousand  right  and then  I gave it  back  but if you  walked at that  point  you would have  40 g  it's not  your money  until you  go to the  cage  and they  give it  to you  in green  backs  my friend  like here's  something  and it's  probably a  really dumb  question  I understand  but is there  a number  in your head  or is it  more of a  feel  it's 
[00:19:30]  if it was  a feel  I would have  walked away  yeah it's  pretty much  a number  could have  been  I'm hot  I think  I could  turn this  into  I was  I was  really hot  I was  moving  and that's  why  we asked  we asked  the deal  we said  could you  raise the  limit  raise the  limit  I don't like  the god damn  two thousand  dollar limit  I want like  a five thousand  dollar limit  and they said  no we won't  raise the limit  next time you  come back  Mr. Kumia  I go I don't  know why I'm  going to be  back  come on  raise the  limit  that's the  only way  you're going  to really  win 
[00:20:00]  but what  does it  take for  you to  walk away  because that's  the whole  thing with  gambling  if you knew  when to walk  away  to be so  tired  it's a tired  thing  and exhausted  I think  but I wasn't  drinking  I was drinking  club soda  and yeah  to be just so  tired that you  look you're  ahead  and you go  you know  something  let's pack  it up  and then  maybe you  might make  a couple  of bets  if I feel  it turning  and I'm  real tired  it's the  end of  the night  I might  make a  couple  of bets  just to  feel out  if it's  still on  the down 
[00:20:30]  swing  and then  if I  lose a  couple  of bets  in a row  like that  I'll go  okay  pack it  up  come on  see I don't  have the  gambling bug  I like to  gamble  you know  here and  there  but in  my head  if I was  up 10,000  it would  be so easy  to leave  just 10,000  I wouldn't  be sitting  there going  I think  I could  get this  to 20  like I  don't have  that  I don't  have that  in my  head  it's a lot  of work  and focus  but then  there's  this identifying  time  where you  realized  luck  has changed  and I  saw that  happen 
[00:21:00]  and when I  changed  tables  it turned  around  again  and I'm  like okay  that's good  now I'm  hitting  but that  turned around  how many  hands does it  take before  you realize  luck is  changing  because you're  going to  lose hands  I mean  you don't  just win  every hand  you see it  even the  dumb  gambling  I do  you just  see it  it isn't  even the  amount  of hands  you're losing  it's the  way you're  getting burned  gets really  bad  like your  big bets  because you  know you  want to win  on your  big bets  you want to  lose on your  small bets  and your 
[00:21:30]  big bets  are just  being taken  away by  the worst  beats possible  you're sitting  there going  oh god  great  I'm sitting  on a  9  19  and that  deal  has got  a friggin  6 showing  or a 5  or a 4  or something  like that  and you're  like this  is great  okay good  it looks  good  they show  a 6  boom  they turn  it over  it's a 5  boom  then pull  the next  card  it's a  picture  and they're  like 21  what the  frig is  going on  here  and if  that happens  a few 
[00:22:00]  times in a  row  not even in a  row  just a few  times  you realize  uh oh  okay  the shoe  really sucks  this is  changing  on me  yeah  and then  you gotta  be smart  enough  I guess  to move  away  or leave  or say  you're done  but  it happens  alright  well there  you go  you can't  win them  all as  they say  there's  your update  uh  Anthony  did not  take  Detroit's  money  no  Detroit  has beaten  me  officially  he lost  how much  7  uh  probably  yeah

[00:24:30]  a lot of  lot of  yes  we don't spend  too much time  on sports  but we're  we're aware  of what's going  on there  and we'll give  you the headlines  yeah we had  a bunch of  people stealing  each other's  thunder over  the weekend  it could have  just been one  big thing  where they were  like oh  look at that  it was like  three things  going on  maybe even  more  yeah  four or five  well the big  one Barry  Bonds  tied Hank Aaron  for the all-time  home run  leader  and I was  thinking about 
[00:25:00]  this on the  plane yesterday  on the way  back from  Detroit  and I'm  thinking  do I really  care if  Barry Bonds  breaks Hank  Aaron's  all-time  home run  record  and I'm  sitting there  going all right  just take a  couple minutes  and do you  actually care  about this  no  I could give  a crap  I could give  a crap  about the  steroids  I could give  a crap  about all  of this  I don't know  if I don't  I think I  don't care  but it's just  because they're  both  so if it 
[00:25:30]  was a  white guy  yeah  what  same  you know  what  ballplayers  what  who said  anything  about  them  not  being  guys  it's always  has to  has to go  too far  Opie  I'm asking 
[00:26:00]  what the beep  is  I'm in the  middle of  talking about  something  I'm asking  what the beep  is  that's all  so  that  they're  you know  okay  they're  bleeps  so  I  came to  the conclusion  I could  give a  crap  I mean  so many  people  are doing  steroids  and  here's  the home  run  call  2-1  pitch  Bond  swings  and he  drives  one to  left  going back  on this  ball  is  Harrison  and  good  off the  facing  of the  second  level 
[00:26:30]  and  Barry  Bonds  has  equaled  baseball's  all-time  home run  record  number  755  for  Bonds  he does  it in  San Diego  and  Bonds  teammates  led by  the manager  Bruce Mochi  are walking  out to  home plate  as Bonds  crosses  home  gives a  huge hug  to his  son  Nikolai  Bonds  with  755  career  home runs  and that's  how it went  down  and that's 
[00:27:00]  how it went  down  yeah  I really  didn't care  it didn't  make any  difference  to me  I guess  you know  if you're  really into  it  and then  A-Rod  decided that  he needed to  hit his  500th  finally  he was in  a drought  yep  and this is  the A-Rod  home run  call  and the 
[00:27:30]  right-hander  Davies  is set  runners lead  the pitch  swung on  it  high in  the air  deep down  the left  field line  it is  going to  be  gone  he's  done it  a long  high drive  down the  left field  line  just there  for a  three run  home run  Alex Rodriguez  has made  Major League  Baseball  history  the youngest  player ever  to hit  500  home runs 
[00:28:00]  an A-bomb  from A-Rod  his 500th  home run  his 36th  home run  of the year  a three run  home run  in the first  inning on  Saturday  August 4th  2007  against Kansas  City  and the Yankees  take a 3-0 lead  see these  announcers  are so aware  that sounded  like a script  like he had  it all written  out  I'm sure he  would have  known what  to have said  yeah 
[00:28:30]  like he wrote  it down  or something  it seems like  the great  home run  calls from  back in the  day  seemed like  it was just  off the cuff  you got caught  up in the  excitement  and you  know  and you just  went with it  these guys  they're so  well prepared  now  they know  people are  going to be  playing their  home run  call  that sounded  like a script  like you had  it in front  of them  for the last  month  just waiting  yeah  because A-Rod  was in a  pretty bad  slump  there  you know  there's no  energy  there's nothing  exciting  about that  we got  here on 
[00:29:00]  pal dog  an A-bomb  from A-Rod  called by  an A-hole  he like  kept it  under control  too  because he  knew that  that home  run call  was going  to be played  a ton of  times  today  so  and that's  another reason  why I don't  really care  about the  Barry Bonds  thing  because A-Rod  this is  Barry Bonds  record for  what  five years  yeah  how many  more home  runs  could Barry  Bonds  possibly hit  really  is he  going to  retire  after this  year  after he  sets the  record  he might  play  next year  where are 
[00:29:30]  we at  with that  I have  no idea  we know  he's going  to be  indicted  in the  fall  most likely  so  are you  allowed  to play  if you're  indicted  I don't  know  just to  give you an  idea  Barry Bonds  was 36  when he  hit his  500th  home run  A-Rod  just turned  32  so  he's got  four years  on Barry  Bonds  this thing  this record  will be beat  by A-Rod  if he stays  healthy  within what  five six  years  yeah  another reason  who gives  a crap  you know  yep  A-Rod's  a better  guy 
[00:30:00]  you like  A-Rod  Jimmy  yeah he's  terrific  oh okay  yeah  great  and then  we had  Glavin  there  yes  a lot  of  milestones  over the  weekend  for the  Metropolitans  Billy Wagner  from the  third base  side  of the  rubber  ready  Wagner  checks  second  here's  the pitch  and it's  hit on the  ground  the second  right at  go tie  he's got  it  throws to  first  put it  in the  history books 
[00:30:30]  Tom Glavin  has become  the 23rd  pitcher  in the  history of  Major League  Baseball  to win  300  career  games  23rd  doesn't sound  that impressive  that didn't  sound impressive  you know  when we're  23rd in the  market  the company  gets mad  yeah they're  not like  I'll be it  Anthony  you're 23rd  guys you're  23rd  alright keep  it up  I don't know  I mean it's  impressive because 
[00:31:00]  it's harder to  get 300 wins  in a career now  yeah  definitely  they don't  pitch as  many times  within a  season  and they're  taken out  of the  game  earlier  and all  that crap  so I  don't know  I think  it'll happen  though  what  another  300  really  yep  Randy Johnson's  got 284  wins  yeah  I'm not  talking about  those guys  what  talking about  robot pitchers  when we get  the robot  league  it's the  future 
[00:31:30]  it's the  future  baseball  yeah robot  league  robot league  who wouldn't  watch the  robot league  but  yeah  I'm psyched  for the  robot league  whenever that  starts  20  let me think  2025  robot league  robot league  yeah  taking over  I'm gonna date  myself  if this tape  ever turns up  somewhere  2025  we will have  the robot league  it's 2025  we don't 
[00:32:00]  just to give you  an idea  Pedro  Martinez  206  wins  Kenny  Rogers  210  wins  with all  that singing  he does  he has time  to pitch  jeez  that guy  is multi  talent  this 300  isn't coming  around anytime  soon  Curt Schilling  I thought he  had more  wins  213  wins  he's got  a ways  to go  Jamie  Moyer  225  David  Wells  who's  pitching  with one  leg  at this  point  235  Mike  Mussina 
[00:32:30]  245  and then  Randy Johnson  is he still  pitching  they traded him  right  but he's out  for the rest  of the season  already  he's got  some kind  of surgery  they're doing  on him  so  he's got  284 wins  so  that's great  what  couth surgery  huh  couth surgery  class surgery  I think  Randy Johnson  will do  300  before he  retires  yeah  what  yeah  well  he  he's out  for the rest  of the year  he had  some surgery  and he'll  come back  next year 
[00:33:00]  gotta be  career wins  not just  show ups  jeez  you don't think  he has a shot  at this point  no  he just needs  a couple  he's got a mess  also in  stupid back  also in sports  you were talking  about  Bernie Brewer  Bernie Brewer  was I talking  about Bernie Brewer  last week  remember Bernie Brewer  the mascot  oh the stupid  mascot  for the  Brewers  right  yeah  and we got  he's the guy  that takes 
[00:33:30]  the slide  the big slide  and he used  to slide  into a big  mug of beer  but because  the children  you know  are there  at the ballpark  they didn't  want to glamorize  beer  so they  took the beer  away  now this guy  with the big  foam head  and a big mustache  and he's supposed  to look like  he's brewing  beer  walks around  on this platform  like an idiot  and then he  slides down the  slide whenever  they get a  home run  right  and it's just  awful because  he doesn't  end in the  beer anymore  no  that was the  whole thing  and the reason  he did that  well I mention 
[00:34:00]  that because  here in New York  they're building  a new stadium  for the New York  Mets  yep  Shea Stadium  right next to it  they're building  a new stadium  and the old  Shea I guess  what are they  going to do  blow it up  or something  or just  disassemble it  slowly  are they going  to blow it  up  yeah  that'll rock  the watch  no they're  easy to blow  up  yeah  there's not  much to them  there's a lot  of emptiness  yeah it's just  pretty much is  just like the  walkway  but uh  and I guess  we gotta ask  this question  today like 
[00:34:30]  what does  every stadium  do for home  run calls  because the  Mets  we forgot  about this  until they  showed it  on TV  this morning  every time  the Mets  hit a home  run  this stupid  freaking  apple  rises up  out of a  top hat  it has a  top hat  on it  see the  apple  comes out  of a top hat  okay  so there's  a top hat  yeah  a big top hat  just sits there  I stopped paying  attention to this  thing years ago  I forgot  all about this  until they brought  it up on the  news today  and I didn't  even realize  they were still  doing it  and I go to  a couple games  every year  I don't even  notice this 
[00:35:00]  thing anymore  it's the  dumbest thing  so it's a  huge top hat  with the Mets  logo on it  and every time  a Mets hits  a home run  this dumb  apple pops  out of it  because it's  the big apple  and oh  and on the  top hat  it says  home run  okay  and then the  apple pops out  and then the  Mets logo  is on the  apple  and there's  lights and  stuff  yeah  it's been  the thing  every time  they've hit  a home run  for the last  what  30-40 years  oh yeah  it's been  there forever  well the  thing barely  works  according to  who  Travis  or Danny  one of  these guys  was there 
[00:35:30]  recently  and saw  this thing  it's in  like  this is  all plywood  and crap  they would  know things  that barely  work  and  they want  to save  the apple  who  because  the Mets  organization  is like  enough  with the  dumb  apple  yeah  let's  move  on  just  move  on  let's  come up  with  something  maybe  a little  cooler  that we  could do  every time  the Mets  hit a home  run  and they  want to  save this  dumb  thing  for what  reason  we don't  know  you know  what  I'll give  you the  reason  because  no matter 
[00:36:00]  what  happens  tradition  people cling  on to this  stupid  sense of  tradition  that because  the goddamn  thing has  been there  for over  30 years  that it  should be  there  when they  build the  new stadium  right  just for  that fact  because it's  been there  long enough  if you put  something  somewhere long  enough people  aren't going to  want you to  move it  doesn't matter  what the hell  it is  robot league  I can't wait  I can't wait  robot ain't gonna  stand for a  stupid hat  and an apple  I like robot  league  robot league  just waiting 
[00:36:30]  but they're only  gonna play like  one out  no what  what do you  mean they'd  they'd be good  yeah but see  the pitchers  would be perfect  and the hitters  but the hitters  would be perfect  so what happens  lots of home  runs  that's what I'm  saying  but Hank  Hank Aaron's  record  done in a week  but robot  pitcher better  than robot  home run  hitter  like who  wins that  battle  it's it's  it all depends  on who's  tuning up  the robots  see that's it  you got a bunch  of geek 
[00:37:00]  mechanics  in locker  rooms now  but how  does  and they're not  locker rooms  anymore  they look  like car  repair bays  oh nice  and there's  just  that's like  I'm trying  to put the  arm on that  right hander  you know  they put a  new arm  on him  right  right  and they  ship him  out there  how does  robot pitcher  get like  the edge  over the  robot  home run  hitter  well with  their eyes  they could  kind of  look in 
[00:37:30]  and know  what the  whole  robot  hitters  record  is  okay  so they  could  like  back  they got  like  bluetooth  they can  communicate  with each  other  but then  the robot  pitcher gets  the weakness  of the  hitter  but then  doesn't the  robot  hitter  adjust  to that  he could  see that's  where the  problem is  he probably  would know  what the  pitch is going  to be before  it even  comes out  because he's  bluetooth with  the pitcher  that's the  problem with  your robot  league  is what I'm  getting at  love it  you need some  kind of free  thinking  involved  look dude  if I had  all the answers  we'd be  watching robot  league baseball  right now 
[00:38:00]  so you think  they're still  figuring out  they're still  working on  them  they're tweaking  this  2025  robot league  look for it  alright  I'm so  psyched  so what's  that website  save the  apple.com  so the rest  of America  can  save the  apple.com  so the rest  of America  can see  how  how ridiculous  this is  save the  apple.com  because the  big apple  loves big  apples  no it  doesn't  I don't  even know  what the  f the  apple means  as far as  New York  goes  the big  apple  what does  that mean 
[00:38:30]  why is  it the  big apple  what does  that mean  we get  that I  like the  empire  state  have a  big  building  come out  of a  hat  it is  stupid  alright  our phone  number is  877-212-ONA  let's go to  Brandon in  Michigan  what's up  Brandon  hey guys  how you  doing  hey  hey  I drove  two hours  to get  to the  show  on  Saturday  yeah  well worth  it  you guys  rocked  yeah  it was a  great show  up there  oh heck 
[00:39:00]  yeah  it was the  best show  I've ever  been to  and I  hope to see  you guys  next year  yeah I think  we would  come back  to Detroit  we couldn't  believe  gotta get  my money  back  yeah  we're going  back  just so  Anthony  doesn't  get a  loss  as far as  gambling  goes  hey Jimmy  yes  hey  I had  the girl  the tall  blonde  girlfriend  who sat  on your  lap  and you  signed  her  boobies  for her  oh the  one with  the short  black dress  dark dress  yeah with  the pin  stripes  yeah she  was lovely  she was 
[00:39:30]  very excited  to see you  I even sent  some pictures  out to your  email  oh thank  you  a lot more  girls listening  to the show  and showing up  at appearances  than the old  days  yeah it's good  to say  yeah  because we were  kind of getting  sick of the  sausage factory  that was becoming  our events  yeah  let's go to  Bruce in Philly  what's up Bruce  hey boys  what's going on  hey man  just want to let  you know  what we do  down here in  Philly when there's  a home run  is it worse  than the stupid  apple popping  out of the  it's pretty close  back in the old  vet stadium  they used to have  this very large 
[00:40:00]  liberty bell  out there  and you used to  hear this fake  gong  well in the new  stadium they've  upgraded it  it's now an  electronic bell  that wiggles  back and forth  but it's  strategically located  right above  the citizens  bank sign  so everyone knows  who the sponsor  is of the  ballpark  oh so you hear  the bell  you instantly  look up  and there  you got  citizens  bank  staring you  in the face  and then you  get to see  what corporate  america has  done to sports  in general  great  sponsor everything 
[00:40:30]  that's wonderful  that's why  I don't give a  crap about  the whole  steroid thing  yeah well  anyway  is that worse  than a stupid  apple popping  out of a  top hat though  no  I would agree  with you  I don't think  it's that bad  but it gets  close  go to save  the apple  to see how  lame this  thing is  and the apple  is just this  decrepit  patched up  mess  they showed  a close up  of it  it's all  dented  and stuff  where engineers  are kicking it  because it's not  working  get the apple  up  get the apple 
[00:41:00]  up  right  they actually  took the bell  from the old  veteran stadium  and it's outside  of the stadium  as a tourist  distraction  believe it  tourist attraction  tourist attraction  right right  right  he's all  rusted  anyway boys  can't wait  to see you  in Camden  no right on  September 15th  yes we got  three comedy  shows left  Washington  Jersey  and Philly  brought to you  by Bud Light  always worth it  and hopefully  we'll update  the MySpace page  virus tour  one word  to get all your 
[00:41:30]  updates  and what's  going on  in the last  three cities  alright there  Bruce  take care  well I thought  we were going  to go to  Pittsburgh  but maybe  after the break  okay  our phone number  877-212-ONA  it's Opie and  Anthony  hey good morning  you're checking  out the Opie and  Anthony show  phone number  877-212-ONA  people got a  couple questions  about your  robot baseball  there Anthony 
[00:42:00]  okay  Dave in  Pennsylvania  what's up  yo ONA  what's up boys  hey man  Anthony  I love the  idea of  robot league  but I have  a question  for you  yes sir  how does  robot league  react when  a robot pitcher  punches robot  wife in a face  outside of a  restaurant  I don't know  that'll be  interesting  it's not  until 2025  but I don't  think robots  will have  wives  why not  there have to  be robot wives 
[00:42:30]  you think  there'll be  robot baseball  league groupies  like there are  now  well you won't  need wives  because you're  not going to  have little  robot kids  right  because the  robots are  just going to  be built  somewhere else  that's why  it's so much  more economical  they could  just put them  away  like you know  instead of  a bus  like they  got that  they got like  a vehicle  like in  Star Wars  where you  know the  little things  come out  and then a  little carousel  drops them  down  and they start  playing ball  yeah  that's it  all right sir 
[00:43:00]  don't question it  by the way  it is pot  talk  Monday  so I guess  we're  pot  talk  Monday  right in  the middle  of pot  talk  uh  Bill in  Pittsburgh  what's  going on  oh no  what's  going on  boys  hey Bill  hey uh  I was just  thinking  there was a  game back  in the day  called  base  wars  it was  robots  that played  baseball  and you  could  equip  them  with bats  and guns  and everything  else  guns  guns  yeah  you can run  the bases  and fight  each other  there it is  base  wars 
[00:43:30]  but that's  just silly  I'm talking  traditional  baseball  played with  robots  yeah that's  a little  different  you can't  add weapons  to baseball  not changing  the rules  or anything  just  just the  players  robots  let's go to  Jason in  Arizona  Jason what's  going on  hey nothing  man I just  want to talk  about a little  robot thing  okay  I saw a  Twilight Zone  episode with  the pitcher  he was a  robot  and uh  I guess  it's like 
[00:44:00]  he was too  good so they  made him get  a heart  I guess  it was the  rule book  or whatever  and uh  he just  felt bad  for being a  perfect pitcher  and they  like uh  just screwed  him up  so  that's right  I do remember  that one  wait so how  did this go  they had a  pitcher  and uh  he was a  robot  and they put  him in  and he was  just great  and and it  was a uh  it was a real  bum team  and they needed  help so they  got this  robot pitcher  and then he  was kicking  ass  he was just  striking everyone  out  and uh  then the  league said  you know  you can't  have a  robot  it's you  know  he's got 
[00:44:30]  to at least  have a  heart  some kind  of heart  to make  a human  so they  gave him  a heart  and then he  couldn't bring  himself to  strike out  so many people  because he  started feeling  badly  for them  and uh  became a  crappy  robot pitcher  but it's  the twilight  zone  so then what  he went  on a  killing  spree  no  Rod Serling  came out  and smoked  a cigarette  and then  died of  cancer  yeah  with that  dumb  twilight  zone  all those  stories  were great  but then  the last  they always  had this  stupid twist  I love  those ones 
[00:45:00]  you're gonna  be dead  you know  by morning  or some  dumb thing  oh it's  great  yeah  I like  the one  with the  glasses  all the  time in  the world  we're after  a nuclear  war  Scott locked  himself in  a vault  and he  comes out  and he  was not  a people  person  it was  Burgess  Meredith  and uh  he just  liked to  read  that's all  he liked  to do  so he  went to  the library  and grabbed  all these  books  and piled  them up  and put  them all  in sections  of books  he wants  to read  and uh  as he's 
[00:45:30]  starting to  look at  all the  books  he bends  down for  something  and his  glasses  fall off  and break  and he's  blind without  his glasses  yeah  so he shot  himself in the  head  see that's  what I mean  that's what I  mean  he'd find some  glasses on a  body and just  put them  I know  but he really  couldn't see  like they  showed his  point of  view  and it was  just completely  out of  focus  there was a  guy who's  just doomed  he'd been  tripping over  everything  couldn't even  see glasses  couldn't he  just hold  him up to  his face  and walk  around  they were  completely  destroyed  why 
[00:46:00]  because Rod  Serling wrote  it that way  he's a prick  Rod Serling  he doesn't  give you any  hope  whatsoever  Rod Serling  was like  sitting  he was just  off to the  side  smoking a  butt  from the  beginning  why couldn't  he help  him out  but he  disappears  as the  show goes  on  but if he  helped  him out  then the  ratings  wouldn't  be good  and we  wouldn't  be talking  about the  twilight  in the  year 2007  hey what  do you got  on St.  Andrews  you don't  really follow  golf  I was going  to say sports  but that's not  true  but you don't 
[00:46:30]  follow golf  and all of a sudden  you were way into  the women  playing at  St.  Andrews  well  after casino  night  when I finally  did wake up  I didn't have  the energy  to grab the  remote  right  and golf  was on  but that was  after the  hip hop  abs  infomercial  hip hop  abs  I sat  through the  whole hip hop  abs  infomercial  which is  ridiculous  they got  some guy  who as  I see  him  I believe 
[00:47:00]  he is  gay  but perhaps  he isn't  I don't  know  this  African  American  hip hop  abs  get flat  sexy abs  without ever  doing a single  crunch or sit  up  how the F  oh dude  and they show  these people  doing the  hip hop  thing  and they have  let me show you  some moves  like the  flavor  and get  busy  that's another  one of the  moves  do you think  I could do  those moves  wait so you  watched an  ab  infomercial  hip hop  abs  and you  didn't do  one crunch 
[00:47:30]  I was  laying down  I was  watching through  one eye  like sleeping  but laughing  at these  people that  they had  on there  so the  women had  to be  really hot  then  no  they weren't  there was  one  the woman  hosting it  is hot  and you  can tell  she didn't  do one  thing  of hip hop  abs  she's at  the gym  really working  out  doing a thousand  crunches a day  then they show  some housewife  you know  going I lost  like five inches  and a dress  size  it was funny  she goes  my jeans  used to be  a size  14  but I was 
[00:48:00]  watching that  and laughing  because they  think they're  getting hot  abs by  dancing to  hip hop  music  and it  ain't  working  and then  golf came  on  and it was  the women's  golf  which you  know  British Open  I believe  yeah  I think  and it was  from the  old course  at St.  Andrews  in Scotland  that's the only  reason you  cared  and it  is the only  reason I  cared  a little  caddyshack  action  all I was 
[00:48:30]  thinking  was Judge  Smales  saying that  with his  stupid jacket  on  just want  you to  know  Lacey  this jacket  was given  to me  by the  knights  of the  links  of St.  Andrews  they called  it  golf  without the  L  they invented  the game  and every  second of it  I'm just  looking at  it  thinking  you know  golf  golf  yeah  but that  course is  ridiculous 
[00:49:00]  it was  raining  cold  and windy  as hell  and you  could just  like hit  the ball  and it  goes off  a cliff  into the  ocean  and ends  up in  like Germany  or somewhere  I don't know  where the hell  it is  it's eaten  by the  Loch Ness  monster  and the  sand traps  are ridiculous  we got  sand traps  here  you know  it's fine  you're hitting  the sand  you knock  it out  whatever  they got  they're sand  traps that are 
[00:49:30]  like foxholes  they're like  military foxholes  I told you  during the break  I think they're  old dinosaur  prints  yeah  there's no  way you're  hitting a  ball out  of those  traps  they're deep  and the  sides go  straight up  but this  I guess  this Mexican  broad  she's pretty  good  I don't  know  I just  know from  watching  I just  know what her  name is  I just  know that  Michelle  wee girl  and she's  a bust  yeah  she was  supposed to  be like  the female  Tiger Woods  and she's  doing nothing  ain't doing  it  nah  oh 
[00:50:00]  that's her  name  her last  name  she's from  Mexico  and she  won the  whole thing  yeah  she's like  she was  kicking ass  or something  I can't  tell  I think  they have  to remove  their left  breast  so they  can get  a good  swing  just  they're  really  dedicated  to the  game  they would  do  that  hey  it's pot  talk  Monday  come on  remove that  because you  know something  when you're doing  that backswing  that breast is 
[00:50:30]  going to get in  the way  you're going to have to  carve that off  I would think  if they  took it off  if the breast  gets in the way  though  didn't the  Amazon women  used to do  that  to get a  better  pull on  their bow  they would  chop off  their right  breast  so they  could like  pull the  arrow back  but if the  breast  gets in the way  we have some  golf experts  out there  what would  that mean  like would  you be slicing  or hooking  I think  you'd be  pushing it  so you'd  probably  come back  around  into the 
[00:51:00]  ball  you'd probably  be hooking  that thing  yeah  so if you  have big  boobies  you're hooking  it  big boobs  ain't playing  golf  well unless  you kind  of adjust  for the  hook  that might  work  maybe there's  a big  breasted broad  on the LPGA  that adjusts  for the hook  because their  boobs get in  the way  see I don't  know enough  about the LPGA  to know if  there are big  breasted girls  like this  Ochoa girl  she had small  breasts  flat as a board  so I think  that helps her  out  or they might  wear these  sports bras  that really  like  I think 
[00:51:30]  there's a rule  that if you  have big  boobies  you're not  allowed to  play  you can't  play  yeah  because the  other girls  get jealous  ah  distracting  yeah  so they're  walking around  bouncing around  I think they  allow full  bees  that's about  it  and you  could hide  golf balls  in there  and then drop  them without  people knowing  if you lose  your ball  just dumping  balls out of  your cleavage  that's stupid  St. Andrews  I did  I took a  little  St. Andrews  I did take  a peek  that is just  a horrible  part of the  world  they're already 
[00:52:00]  in the middle  of winter  it's not even  supposed to be  winter yet  no wonder  they drink  they all have  like rain gear  yeah  they were all  in this rain gear  it looked freezing  like one of the  girls would get  her club  and then pull  her collar up  around her neck  and sitting there  just freezing cold  trying to whack  the ball  just awful  and it was this  misty rain  that you know  was ice cold  they're on the  I guess the channel  and it's just 
[00:52:30]  wind blowing in  you can't even go  swimming  it's all rocky  the water is like  ice water  there's cliffs  you could die  playing there  you can't even get  down to the beach  even if you wanted to  there's no beach  there  it's just raining  constantly  they gave up on  building anything new  it's like ah we got  castles that are  600 years old  yeah screw it  that's what they said  it's 600 years  that course has been  there  they've been playing  on that course  for 600 years  just imagine 
[00:53:00]  like  who was playing  there  some knight  with his sword  what animals were  alive 600 years  ago  oh my god  the brontosaurus  was alive and well  600 years ago  woolly mammoths  woolly mammoths  plenty of them  when did we lose  the woolly mammoth  there E-Rock  E-Rock  do research  I want to know  if like you could  be playing golf  back then  and a woolly mammoth  it just happens  to walk across  a course somewhere  I'm saying  the last woolly mammoth  was probably around 
[00:53:30]  50,000 years ago  no  I'm going to say  50,000 years ago  for a woolly mammoth  I think  I think  Professor Anthony  is going to be off  fan you know  no I was going to  guess 10  10,000  I think it's less  than that  less than 10,000  yeah I think  the last one  died off  right around  the revolutionary  war  1700s  a woolly mammoth  I've seen them  in museums  they can't be  that old  no  I'm saying 
[00:54:00]  50 G's  12,000  died out  at the end  of the  yeah  12,000 years ago  push  sort of  but a small  population  survived on  St. Paul Island  in Alaska  up until  6,000 BC  wow  well yeah  hot dog  Monday  well yeah  I didn't know that  alright  10,000 years  that's barely  barely a minute  oh boy  what douches  woolly mammoths 
[00:54:30]  are just hairy  elephants  that's what they were  hairy elephants  who likes them  imagine the stuff  that would get  stuck to him  under that tail  oh  it's bad enough  when like your cat  you have to chase him  around the house  because he ate  a little tinsel  dragging around  click clacks  that almost  are just dumb  they have their own  crap  pasted to their fur  back here  I don't know  what's going on  but that cat's  dragging some  stinky sausage links

[00:57:00]  have any  faith in  what the hell  is that  this time  around  we weren't  getting the  phone calls  like the  first time  we did  it  and then  in the  end  it all  just came  together  nicely  yep  and  great  contestants  to the  point we  want to  bring it  back  sooner  than  later  yeah  we  want to  do  one  within  another  month  or  two  that's  some  disgusting  afflictions  but the  vomit  inducing  huh  vomit  inducing  afflictions  I was  thinking  about  that  contest  and  I was  thinking  that  the  poor  guy  that  had  his  nostril  ripped  off  his  face  by  his  dog  he  went in  to  just  kiss  his 
[00:57:30]  dog  at night  and the  dog  just  ripped  off  his  face  or  bit  his  nose  off  pretty  much  bit  a  whole  nostril  completely  off  and left  a hole  between  his  nostril  and his  lip  I mean  just  awful  I don't  even  know  but he  was  trying  to do  some  kind  of  English  here  there's  the  picture  Jimmy  he  was  trying  to do  the  right  thing  he  brought  a dog  home  that  probably  had  problems  back  in  the  day  obviously  the  problems  were  he  doesn't  want  anyone 
[00:58:00]  kissing  him  he  was  molested  that's  what I  hinted  at  to this  fine  owner  he  worked  for  Ving  Rames  I  hear  that  story  is  pretty  wild  which  should  have  sicked  dogs  on  him  dead  with  bull  mastiffs  and peanut  butter  all over  his  lap  date  gone  wrong  what was  it a  worker  at  Ving  Rames  house  yeah  something  happened  I think  the workers  found  the dead  guy  yeah  I don't  know who  the dead  guy  was  though  yeah  I  don't  know  it  was 
[00:58:30]  a  worker  on  Ving  Rames  property  but  getting  back  to  this  guy  so  he  loses  his  nostril  and  what  you  see  in  there  Jimmy  is  that's  his  new  nostril  growing  in  which  used  to  be  part  of  his  cheek  they're  building  it  out  of  his  cheek  yeah  the  picture  is  up  on  our  website  and  this  is  what  I  was  thinking  so  we  do  what  the  hell  is  that  this  guy  comes  in  to  share  with  us  he  gets  his  nostril  ripped  off  his  face  now  now  they  have  to  take  part  of  his  cheek  to  build  a  new  nostril  and  build  a  nose  for  the  guy  or  half  a  nose  and  the  guy  came  in  second  place  second  place  eventually  they're  going to 
[00:59:00]  cut  that  off  and  remold  it  into  the  side  of  his  nostril  yeah  it's  amazing  they  built  it  out  of  his  cheek  and  some  of  his  leg  and  I  guess  it's  going  to  look  pretty  good  in  the  end  we'll  see  you  don't  have  faith  in  this  thing  zero  faith  why  what  seems  to  be  the  issue  here  look  it's  a  bit  big  right  now  but  they'll  shave  it  down  or  something  it  looks  like  they  made  a  nostril  out  of  hubba  bubba  yeah  well  it's  stretched  across  his  face  because  they  said  what  the 
[00:59:30]  name  was  some  kind  of  bridge  thing  and  then  they  shape  it  when  they  flow  and  then  it  lives  for  a  while  like  that  and  then  they  cut  it  off  and  then  slap  it  to  his  side  of  his  nose  and  bend  it  around  so  it  kind  of  looks  like  the  side  of  your  nostril  right  well  amazing  what  they're  doing  these  days  but  when  he's  at  this  point  kind  of  looks  silly  yeah  when  he's  in  that  transitional 
[01:00:00]  phase  he  came  in  second  place  and  the  winner  was  the  guy  with  the  bump  the  tumor  what  was  that  a  pus  filled  lump  on the  top  of  his  head  Jimmy  that's  that  oh god  I can't  even look  at it  yeah but  that  picture  doesn't do  it  justice  I'm  sorry  enough  because  I  saw  it  that  bump  is  a lot  bigger  than  the  picture  showing  it's  flaky  oh there  you go  there it  is  oh my god  it's  flaky  and it's  full of  this  green  brown  and 
[01:00:30]  it  went  all  over  the  guy's  hair  and  left  this  globule  of  it  on  top  of  the  actual  mound  on  his  head  and  Bob  Kelly  vomited  profusely  and that's  what we  want to play  today  just in case  you missed  it  but  what was  it  I was  just about  to ask  that too  did we  find out  what this  was  a pod  from  the  gremlins  I guess  what it  looked like  when they 
[01:01:00]  opened up  what was  this  it  was  some  type  of  cyst  that  was  infected  on his  head  have  that  removed  unless  you  enjoy  squeezing  pus  out of  your  head  every  so  often  it  was  so  like  it  was  just  flaky  like  you  said  flaky  like  it  looked  like  it  was  like  dandruff  that  just  built  up  over  time  and  just  layers  and  layers  and  layers  of  like  dandruff  scraping  off  this  thing  it  was  under  so  much  pressure  that  when  the  doctor  barely  like  squeezed 
[01:01:30]  it  it  just  exploded  this  pussy  yeah  see  doesn't  it  give  you  the  heebie  jeebies  yeah  well  so  disgusting  that  guy  deserved  to win  and  he  won  and  this  is  what  happened  I  think  when  we  popped  this  this  thing  Bob  Kelly  was  in  studio  listen  to  this  oh  wow  wait  wait  I want  to  see  this  wait  can you  guys  do  it  over  here  what  the  hell  is  that  see  that's  why  the  show  is  called  what  the  hell  is  that  what  is  that  is  it  leaking  pus  right  now  it  would  if  I  squeezed 
[01:02:00]  it  oh  Jesus  Christ  oh  my  god  I  can't  look  holy  crap  oh  my  god  this  is  awesome  don't  even  show me  a picture  get out  of here  Bob  Kelly's  vomiting  Bob  Kelly's  vomiting  Bobby's  puking  it looks  like  oh  Bobby's  puking  already  it  took the  first  guy  on  what  the  hell  is  that  Bobby  dude  that  would  squirt  across  the  room  I  bet  how  far  have  you  gotten  it  have  you  gotten  it  all  over  the  mirror  and  stuff  we 
[01:02:30]  learned  a long  time ago  the guy  has a  very weak  stomach  very weak  so then  Bob  Kelly  is  just  so  annoyed  that  he's  seeing  this  he  continues  here  it  sort  of  exploded  once  in  front  of  me  and  I  had  dust  some  particles  off  the  mirror  get a  hat  it's  bad  for your  hair  to wear  a hat  I hope 
[01:03:00]  we have  the line  where  Bob  just  screams  out  somebody  help  him  in  desperation  Bob  Kelly  just  starts  yelling  somebody  help  him  and  then  we  got  Bobby  puking  again  over  this  whole  thing  yeah 
[01:03:30]  Bobby  really  doesn't  like  this  at  all  nobody  nobody  you're  right  Bobby  we're  still  on  regular  radio  Bobby  Bobby  sorry  that's  okay  Bobby's  got tears  in his  eyes  all right  Bobby  check  tears  in his  eyes  I guess  he looks  at this  lump  it's like  jumping in  a pool  give me  a second  give me  a second  give me  a second  Bobby's 
[01:04:00]  looking  here we  go  he took  one  look  ran  off  in his  bucket  and  is  puking  in the  corner  he's got  a weak  stomach  man  it's  a hole  in that  kid's  head  somebody  needs  to help 
[01:04:30]  him  he can't  talk  his eyes  were all  watery  it's  amazing  he could  puke  that easily  just seeing  something  like that  and then  finally  it ends  with  this clip  from Bob  Kelly  can you  pop  this  I want  to see  something  squirt  out  oh  Jesus  don't aim  it at  me  aim it  over there  well just  give it a little  squeeze  I'm right  here  oh god  damn

[01:05:30]  Bobby's  puking  no joke  Bobby is  puking  and he had  an empty  stomach  a huge  gob  of pus  squirted  out of  that thing  and went  into his  hair  this is the worst  show I've ever been on 
[01:06:00]  we're back live  there you go  he makes the best puking noises  I thought  Pat from  Minaki made some good puking noises  but Bob Kelly man  that's  he was so genuinely disgusted  so was I  I could not take it  for me it goes from disgusting  to just so funny  that it's not disgusting anymore  well thank god Bobby was here  and I was able to laugh at that  because that guy's pus 
[01:06:30]  shooting out of his head  yeah when the green brownish  pus came  yeah flying out like that  I was  I was skeeved out  but then I started listening  to Bob Kelly  and I was back  I was back in  that's like a primitive  animals  defense mechanism  yeah  they squirt pus  from their head  to chase away predators  so there you go  what the hell is that  was a huge success  and um  and we're already  taking contestants  for the next one  yeah  what do these people  have to do  just get a hold of Travis  I guess 
[01:07:00]  yeah Travis  at Foundry Music  Travis at Foundry Music  dot com  what do you got  what's your affliction  there could be a prize  waiting for you  that guy walked away  with an iPhone  and we had some other  guys that were great too  but after that  yep  you know we're barely  remembering the poor guy  that's getting a nostril  you know  nostril job  being built for  for his face  and then tell me  one other guy  scar back  scar back  yeah where the scar  came out of nowhere  yeah  that scar came out of nowhere 
[01:07:30]  his skin mutated  into scar tissue overnight  yeah  and they don't really know  why that happens  that's gotta be wonderful  something like that  if I remember correctly  and then you had  the lump head  and then you had  the lump head  because glass was still  coming out of his head  years after a  after a car accident  he got into a car crash  and he was pulling glass  out of his head  for years later  he was feeling the lump  one day  and he shaved his head  and the barber  actually went  what's this  and pulled this  big chunk of  glass out of his head 
[01:08:00]  yeah  so his body was pushing  pushing the glass  out  pushing it out  of his head  not good enough  to win though  puss head  no puss head  it's all about  puss head  that guy has  two uvula  right  with a little  punching bag  in your throat  we gotta take a break  but Tim came back in  to update the promo  for free ringtone  monday mania  didn't say a word  either  came in  threw it down  and walked out  oh is he mad  I think he's annoyed  it's free ringtone

[01:09:30]  greetings  the agony  of defeat  on TV  over and over again  we were just  watching  that skateboarder  what a tool  on the X Games  he fell  45 feet  45 feet  went up  one of those  huge ramps  I guess it was  a hike competition  you know  see how much  air you can get  and he  went up  and man  just lost  his board  and ends up  plummeting  what's great 
[01:10:00]  about the X Games  there's really  no rules  it's a new  sport for the  most part  compared to  all the other  sports  and they're  just making  up crap  every year  that's getting  more and more  insane  yeah  how high  can you get  on a skateboard  so this guy  was just  flying  goes up  the ramp  and they  have a  whole  thing  on how high  you went  on the side  he was pushing  20 feet  above the  lip  of the ramp  yep  and then he  lost the skateboard  and sort of 
[01:10:30]  was doing this  look I'm running  in midair  thing  I hope this  helps me  damn that  gravity  he did that  for about  10 seconds  as he plummeted  back to the ramp  plummeted to the ramp  he hit on  kind of the back  of his heels  first  and both of his  shoes flew off  I lost my  shoes  his shoes  fell off  and then he hit  right on his ass  and then  bam his head  hit  on the  wood  he was still  wearing his helmet  or he would have  been dead 
[01:11:00]  but he got  knocked the F out  just knocked out  gone ragdolled  and they're calling him  the agony of defeat  or the headlines  agony of defeat  he's a hero now  everyone knows his name  what's his name  because I don't know  I was like  I wish they'd show his name  so at least we could say  who the hell he was  but  Chip Nance  Chip Nance  yeah  we'll call him that  thanks Jim  good name  he's the  Chip Nance  the skater  so Chip Nance  Chip Nance  they're gonna have to 
[01:11:30]  I bet he's got a  stupid name like that  they're gonna have to  add parachutes to the  X Games  Steve's writing  me a note  no one cares  no one cares  love your taste  of your  no one cares  could you please  in my  I don't know  his name  Jake  Jake Brown  Jake Brown  ask me again  and I'll knock you down  alright  hey by the way  this is coming in  from Buffalo today  what's up Buffalo  Chocolate Rain  has made the Buffalo news 
[01:12:00]  so there you go  oh yeah  it's officially  Chocolate Rain  phenomenon  and they did  something on E  yeah  about Chocolate Rain  it's just taking over  the world  it was  this guy Fuzzy  in Connecticut  saying it wasn't  a height competition  why would they have  like a measuring thing  hey Fuzzy  my friend  what was that then  yeah what it was  it's a trick competition  you know how  he goes down  that long ramp  and then he's gotta do  like a trick  into the quarter pipe  right  and then a trick  at the other end  of the quarter pipe 
[01:12:30]  and he pulled off  a reverse 720  when he went in  but then when he went out  he got the speed wobbles  on the way up  and that was his demise  right there  it looked like he went  to grab the front  of his board  and kinda couldn't  get the front of it  no man  it was obvious  he got the speed wobble  he got the speed wobble  he got the speed wobble  and that took him out  but his shoes flying off  were like explosive  it's hilarious  yeah his shoes  went flying man  they gotta make shoes  that don't come off  when bad things  happen to you 
[01:13:00]  cause like  every time someone  gets hit by a car  the news shows  those shoes  on the street  you fly out of  your goddamn shoes  no matter how tightly  they're tied  the worst  the worst is when  you see somebody's  pants ripped down  from a car  oh yeah  like when they've  been hit by a car  and their trousers  have been pulled down  and their shoes  are still on  so the pants  buckle down  and pull over  the shoes  it looks like  you're walking  out to the linen  closet for a new  roll of TP  because you forgot it  you're doing  the shuffle  here's the official 
[01:13:30]  explanation  after pulling off  a difficult 720  over the ramp  70 foot gap  he launched up  the adjacent  quarter pipe  and immediately  lost control  plunging face first  his legs  pedaling wildly  Brown turned over  in the air  and landed on  his tailbone  with his head  and limbs  hitting soon after  he knew how to fall  he figured out  how to get his body  sort of around  so he could survive  the damn thing  yeah  because everyone  when you fall  from any type  of distance  you definitely  try to fall  on your side  no matter what  do you  I think people 
[01:14:00]  instinctively  try to land  on their feet  no that'll  that'll  like I think  it's I know  but I think  it's an instinct  like other people  know  not to do that  but  you would really  fall on your feet  well there's  a  what they call  a PLF  so like  parachute landing  fall  and you know  you hit your feet  first  and then you bend  and then your knees  and then your hip  and then your shoulder  so you do kind of  a roll thing  and it absorbs 
[01:14:30]  the shock  over more parts  of your body  anytime I've ever  had a fall  I always try to  fall onto my  like shoulder  and side  no way  that was  screw your  organs up  supposedly  if you land  on your feet  from  help us out  somebody out there  is an expert  I'm not talking  like  the roof  of this building  your leg bones  could go right  right up  and kill you  yeah well  let me tell you  something  if that's gonna happen  like if he tried  to land on your side  you're getting  so many internal injuries 
[01:15:00]  I think I'm gonna say  it's better to fall  on your side  from that distance  the distance he did  especially  falling contest  falling contest  let's go  me and O  come on  let's start  with the couch  it's a good  one foot  one and a half feet  my friend used to  do karate  and he said  the way to fall  it's hard to do  is when you're falling  just release  roll of your tension  fall  like let yourself  hit the ground  but don't  he goes  when you tense up  is when you get  really hurt  but he might have  been wrong  but I'm just saying  that's what you're  supposed to do  is just not tense up  alright we need 
[01:15:30]  an expert  on falling  is it better to fall  it depends on how  how many feet  are we talking  ten feet  ten feet  you can land  on your feet  ten feet  I'm thinking  the best  dude you gotta  you gotta spread  the energy  over as much  of your body  as possible  without  any one part  taking all the impact  so when you land  on your feet  I'm not saying  stiff leg  your knee  lock those kneecaps  and land on your feet  like you land  on your feet  you bend your knees 
[01:16:00]  you absorb  that energy  then you hit  your hip  which  your butt  part of your hip  and then  you kind of  do a roll  over on your shoulder  you know  you're kind of  absorbing all the energy  that's what the  old parachutists  used to do there  I don't think  they still do  because they got  those nice chutes  where you could  just kind of  like land on your feet  while you're running  but the old  World War II guys  they would do  what's called a PLF  and they came down  pretty hard  those guys  and did a little roll 
[01:16:30]  you know  they're experts  the World War II guys  I think you just  come home  I mean  land on your hip  like that  or on your side  what if you land  on a rock  what if you do that  and your ankle  hits a rock  where your hip  hits like a little pebble  Nazis are shooting  your ass  that's pretty much  what happened  let's go to  Jared in Boston  I'm sure a lot of guys  are all ready for battle  and just snap  there now you got  a broken leg  behind enemy lines  godspeed  good luck to you bro  Jared what's up 
[01:17:00]  er  chocolate rain  he'll never ever  try that trick again  chocolate rain  I hate to say it  but we might have to  retire the chocolate rain  thing  wow  the helmet kept us  from seeing his brain  chocolate rain  chocolate rain  it was featured on  VH1's best week ever  and then I'm getting  this from the instant  feedback  well I was  John  from Kansas City 
[01:17:30]  these hacks in Kansas  City  the Dick Dale show  on 96.5  hey  on 96.5  the buzz  are playing  chocolate rain now  please come to KC boys  all right  we're  every radio station  in America is now  onto the chocolate  rain thing  retire it  retire it  hoist the number  to the rafters  chocolate rain  bye bye  oh no  it's a hack bit  now  then again  what we do  with it though  is we rhyme  awful things to it  yeah  I'm sure  the Dick Dale show  isn't rhyming 
[01:18:00]  awful things to it  was he  huh  he wasn't doing that  was he  nah I don't think so  it says here  bend your Iraq  came at this  bend your knees  possibly nothing  is more important  to surviving a fall  than bending your knees  research has shown  that having one's knees  bent at impact  can reduce the magnitude  of impact forces  36 fold  wow  what's one fold  I don't know  36 folds  the worst way  to hit concrete  is to point your toes down  like when you're doing 
[01:18:30]  a straight dive  like in ballerina form  oh my god  that doesn't help  I know what it means  your legs fold up  36 times  alright we're getting  a lot of people  calling in now  they're all saying  the same thing  legs work as shock absorbers  if you bend them  alright we got it  and don't split  like you're doing a split  like don't open  no never do that  and try to land  on your testicles  that's never good  for a fall  imagine if that was  someone's strategy  I'm just gonna  spread my legs apart  my testicles  will absorb the impact  that's what they're there for  Bill from Waterford 
[01:19:00]  is saying  the Dick Dale show  the show should be attacked  for having an awful name  let's find out about  Dick Dale in Kansas City  poor Dick Dale  his phone's gonna start ringing  and he's not even gonna know why  why are my phones ringing  hey Matt in South Carolina  off the instant feedback  you were talking about  the left boob getting in the way  where'd you get that theory from  what the one where they cut it off  the Amazon women  no no no  the LPGA  oh cause I was watching them golf  and you know how guys  guys do that backstroke 
[01:19:30]  and the left arm  stays pretty close to their chest  yeah  you know  but you didn't hear this anywhere right  oh hell no  I got a microphone  I make up my own crap  someone is backing you up  and god  really  I hope we can find this clip  Matt in South Carolina  supposedly back in 1995  Ben Wright  who is a  CBS golf  broadcaster  said the following  oh  please  I pray this is right  or true  women are handicapped  by having boobs 
[01:20:00]  he wouldn't say boobs  though would he  boobs  he would have to say breasts  no  I'm obsessed with this now  I need  I need to find audio  where's this quote  women are handicapped  by having boobs  it's not easy for them  to keep their left arm straight  and that's one of the  tenets of the game  their boobs get in the way  I think I remember  hearing something like that  find that clip  there was a lot of  controversy there  find that clip  just  make a commitment 
[01:20:30]  to your sport  and lop it off  you still have the  right one  but the left one's  gotta go  you gotta be  she'll quit the game  let's say hi to Matt  in Boston  Matt  yeah  what's up Matt  what's happening  hey man  come on let's go  speak  oh yeah  I got a nice  following story  for you guys  I have an uncle  I'm not gonna name names  but  he got hammered 
[01:21:00]  one night  he got dared  to hang up  like a bridge  over these train tracks  and  being hammered  you know what I mean  he couldn't hang on  too long  he got just over  the tracks  and  let go  and landed on  the train tracks  and it actually  pushed his hips up  so now he's got  like a permanent  penguin walk  like  you know  penguin for Batman  pretty bad man  he should see the guy  he should have  bent his legs  yep  I mean he's short  and fat too  so he kind of like  fits the pot 
[01:21:30]  it's hilarious  you gotta see him  another mistake  people make  when they fall  is a lot of times  people will try to land  on their cheekbone  that's the mistake  they say  never use the cheekbone  to absorb  because it's meaty  and plump  you would think  you could land on it  and it would be safe  like a little padding  you'd go from cheekbone  into like nose  onto other cheekbone  and use your face  to absorb  use your face  roll slowly  across your entire face  can you imagine  to absorb the shock  hey let's go to  Sarah in Maine  Sarah  hey  I just wanted to say 
[01:22:00]  that when I fell  10 feet from my horse  and I landed on my hip  I dislocated my hip  and couldn't walk  for like 3 days  like don't think  it's such a good idea  3 days  that's nothing  that's how I fall though  on my side  not good huh  yeah but on your side  yeah it's like  I bruised my hip  and I was in the hospital  for like a day  and like they had to  like shove a catheter  in me  it wasn't fun  oh  were you in that  horse gag video  I love that one  loved your work  I think Jimmy's idea  of no tension  is a better idea 
[01:22:30]  no tension  just let it out  that's impossible though  when you're in that  situation  you're tensing  every muscle  you're talking about  fighting though  not like falling  from 45 feet  just like in a fight  he goes  in a karate fight  he goes  you just gotta  fall on your ass  and he goes  just relax and fall  because that will  help the impact  a lot more  but that's the true  talent being able  to do that  as soon as anyone's  in a moment  you just tense up  when you know  a car accident  that's gonna happen  what do you do  you tense every  freaking muscle  you know you're  gonna get in the  clocks in or fall  just get drunk  you don't get  tense then  yeah 
[01:23:00]  alright Sarah  thank you  I'd pull out  an umbrella  and float down  on it  and sing a happy  tune  yes  or whistle a happy  song  Anna's right about  falling  alright enough  enough about  the falling  you know what  way it works  this is something  people try  which is not  as effective  as you think  is when they're  falling  they put their  legs straight out  as if they're  on a chair  with their legs  straight out  and they straighten  their arms  beneath them  and they try to  brace their impact  with the tips  of their fingers  with their fingertips 
[01:23:30]  braced underneath  them  they figure that  will absorb  the impact  and it never  works  you would think  because your  fingertips bend  they would absorb  the shock  let's say hi  to Carmen  from Jersey  she's a girl  Carmen what's up  hi  I have such  a hard time  swinging  I can't  my boobs  get in the way  so you like  to play golf  but your boobs  get in the way  they do  how big are  your boobs  I said to my  boyfriend  I want to get  them reduced  to like a  32A 
[01:24:00]  so I can have  a better swing  you'll have  a better swing  but no boyfriend  no way  he says  keep those  babies  keep going  no do not  how big  oh my god  alright so you  can answer the  question  so you play  golf  you got these  big boobs  that get in  the way  do you hook  or slice  oh I don't  know  hook I hope  yeah  she doesn't  know the  difference between  a hook and a slice  it's a hard time  I'm going to give  up golf  listen to me  so are you 
[01:24:30]  a righty golfer  left  lefty golfer  lefty golfer  just give up  the sport already  play ping pong  we don't make  golf courses  for lefties  I know  so I'm learning  now with my  right  but still  they're so big  they're just like  you know when you  put your hands  together  they squeeze  you gotta squeeze  them  you squeeze the  boobs  you squeeze the  boobs  and it's  uncomfortable  you know  you don't have  the freedom  to swing  yeah she needs 
[01:25:00]  some golf  instruction  she's really  trying to keep  her phone call  going  your left arm  has to be  straight  I've never  smoked  in my life  oh yeah  oh yeah  it's hard  so I'm learning  I'm learning  to be a righty  no no you gotta  bend the right  though Jimmy  as you keep  the left straight  you come up  like this  and then you  have to squeeze  and you're  squeezing these  boobs  and it's like  terrible  all right  we get it  we get it  we get it  good luck  godspeed  you big breasted  animal  we understand 
[01:25:30]  hey  on the course  with your mouth  open  let them hit the  ball into that  all right  thank you  hey we got  more Ben Wright  I heard she was  hit between the  first and second  holes  that old gag  I love that old  joke  by the way  Ben Wright  supposedly that quote  we read you  it ran in a paper  he denies saying it  here's another Ben Wright  quote coming in  you might have  your own out there  I don't know  maybe you're doing  research too  CBS veteran golf  analyst Ben Wright  was quoted as saying  lesbians are ruining 
[01:26:00]  the ladies pro golf  tour and that  women can't play  because they have  breasts  he said that too  is he still working  no he's not  no he's not  yeah they dropped  them  damn  even back then  huh  wow  well he said  something about  how come he's  like those dykes  can't play because  god doesn't love  them  yeah  I remember that  quote  that might have  been the one  that put him  over the edge  dope  the breast remark  sounds like legit 
[01:26:30]  though  that's like a  physical thing  yeah but you  probably can't say  it  really  I would think  you'd get in  trouble  say it's harder  because of the  swing  uh yeah  yeah  you gotta keep  that pretty close  you gotta keep  your arms straight  and you can't do  that with the  the boob  with your boob  snap man  from whack bag  this bitch  should keep  the boobs  and remove  the vocal  cord  so what  happened  now  what are you  typing up  so go ahead  iraq  he did  admit  that the 
[01:27:00]  comment was  wrong  in the  may 18th  1995  issue of  sports  illustrated  which  comment  about the  lesbians  ruining the  game  and the  breast  comment  why are  lesbians  ruining golf  what they  couldn't  they can't  help themselves  and they  just gotta  get in  some action  constantly  like  like  why do they  say that  everyone knew  that like  if you  if you  were a  women's  golfer  there was  odds were  good that  you were  a lesbian  yeah  probably  because  like  every time  someone pulls 
[01:27:30]  the flag  out  they jump  on it  and bury  their face  yes there  his quote  was  let's face  facts  here  lesbians  in the  sport  hurt  women's  golf  when it  gets to  the  corporate  level  that's  not  going  to  fly  they're  going  to  a  butch  game  and that  further  the bad  image  of the  game  wow  a butch  game  I must  say  watching  some of  the  women's  British  Open  there  a lot 
[01:28:00]  of  girls  that  appeared  to me  to come  off  like they  weren't  very fond  of gentlemen  and the  woman  that was  doing  some of  the  color  commentary  with  two  gentlemen  wow  yeah  wow  she must  have  played  golf  years  ago  she  was  an  older  broad  but  I'm  talking  probably  probably  in my  opinion  just  from  basic  first  like  when you 
[01:28:30]  first  get  impression  of  somebody  who  lesbian  really  oh yeah  is it  true  too  that  most  of  these  golfers  had  a tough  time  getting  to  the  back  nine  well  they  just  want  to  play  the  front  nine  over  and  over  again  they  love  the  front  how  could  you  tell  she  was  a  lesbian  is  just  the  way  she  said  oh  the  way  she  spoke  the  way  her  hair  was  done  you  know  the  stereotypical  kind  of  you  can  just  kind  of  tell  the  haircut  the  haircut  definitely  it  was  a  mullet  type  thing  with  the 
[01:29:00]  spiky  top  what  about  her  chin  what  about  it  it  wasn't  smell-o-vision  I  couldn't  tell  her  chin  yes  a few  hairs  on her  chin  they  didn't  go in  that  close  yeah  thank  god  tennis  no  golf  we  just  picture  I  don't  know  lesbian  golfers  in the  locker  room  just  going  to  town  on  each  other  something  about  straight  people's  perception  of gay  people  is that  whenever  they're  alone  they're  just  having  this 
[01:29:30]  like  sick  sex  all the  time  they  just  can't  help  themselves  like  two  gay  guys  get  alone  somewhere  and  it's  just  sex  no matter  if  they  know  each  other  or  not  the  lesbians  are  in a  locker  room  at a  tennis  match  or  something  and  they're  in the  shower  and  it's  just  sex  sex  everywhere  sex  because  it's  all  about  sex  we  just  have  that  impression  I don't  know why  wow  alright  yeah 
[01:30:00]  oh god  wow  we'll have  to read  these  Ben Wright  things on  the other  side of  the show  today  did he  say a  little  more  people  speculating  or  well  this  has  come  from  pow  talk  supposedly  Ben  Wright  back in  the day  said  there  are  enough  holes  on a  golf  course  already  alright  we gotta  take a  break  so the  women  are  bad  enough 
[01:30:30]  as long  as we  never  accept  the  on  the  way  Danny  found  your  hip  hop  ab  infomercial  we got  some  clips  from  that  and  we also  have  we like  when  athletes  retire  Michael  Irving  yep  he  well he  retired  obviously  but he  got  inducted into  the Hall  of Fame  over the  weekend  right  so we  got him  sobbing  a bit  I saw  it without  the sound  on 
[01:31:00]  I saw  the TV  and I'm  like  I see  some tears  there  we might  need  that  audio  it's  just  gives  us  an excuse  to play  the  Mike  Schmidt  he  didn't  do  a  Mike  Schmidt  no  but  then  we  get  to  play  it  we  still  got  a lot  to do  stay there  it's  Opie and  Anthony  the conversation  takes such a unique  turn when we're off the air  for the  for the breaks  it sure does  Opie and Anthony 
[01:31:30]  Jim Norton  Ben Wright quotes  coming in  from instant feedback  sometimes I love  hearing Kenny's  take on sexuality  yeah yeah  very funny  can that  go on the air  you think  of course not  probably not  sorry Kenny  you're funny  in front of six people  yeah but it wasn't  original  I was just  repeating something  a friend once told me  alright  a little heads up  to Al  Al 
[01:32:00]  I'm just gonna read  these and hope  for the best  Ben Wright  what was Ben Wright's  original quote  basically saying that  women's boobs  get in the way  in golf  in golf  well he's curious  how he's lesbian  he said lesbian  shouldn't be  yeah that too  he's not a fan  of the lesbian  they can't swing  that golf club  with the boobs  in front of them  like that  well we got  Nate Sack  from Jericho  Long Island  he writes  the grounds crew  think that  women's golfers  are ruining  golf  because they  don't have  any more  lawns to mow  messed up 
[01:32:30]  his line  sorry  that's alright  and then we got  no bones  from PA  Ben Wright  said lesbians  are ruining  the game  because they  have no  experience  handling  balls  that old  gag  and fast  ready  from Jamaica  station  Ben Wright  said  dykes  shouldn't  play  golf  because  they  don't  know  how  to  work  the  shaft  alright  well maybe  because  someone's  hands on  a golf  club  they kick  it  and go  yuck  get it  away  from  there  you go  boo 
[01:33:00]  alright  we got  the ex  gamer  falling  50 feet  we got  some audio  of that  dude  we got  the hip  hop  abs  that you  were  watching  while we  were  in  Detroit  couldn't  tune  away  the infomercials  I'm one of  those people  that get  like hypnotized  by the  infomercials  and I'll  sit and  watch them  even though  I'm cringing  in embarrassment  for everybody  that's on  them  why  I don't  know  they're just  so bad  they're so  like this  is great  I've lost  so much  weight  and then 
[01:33:30]  they show  why they  like lost  weight  and they're  doing it  I like  doing the  flavor  that's a  great move  I like  doing the  get busy  it even  works in  the clubs  and I'm  just watching  on  why  oh god  this is  horrible  do you know  when I was  new in my  career  I warmed  up for  an infomercial  it was a  six hour  shoot day  it was for  the guy  and the girl  Jan  that awful  girl  that always  do them  together  the home  right  paint stick  where they  wanted a comedian  to come in  and warm up  the crowd  while they  were  I remember  that one  and it was 
[01:34:00]  atrocious  I was bombing  so badly  like in between  takes I finally  just started  talking to the  audience and  like just  find out where  they're from  and they're like  we want to  follow your  career  it just  became a  not the one  where the  paint handle  acted like  a syringe  almost  and like  sucked the  paint into  it  and then  you'd slowly  squeeze it  into the  roller  so you  wouldn't have  to keep  putting it  in the  roller  yeah  that's how  it looked  on TV  you squeeze  it and paint  you shoot  you're carpeting 
[01:34:30]  it was just  junk like  well they never  work like  they're supposed  though  yeah  a lot of  a lot of  reviews coming  in from the  Detroit show  by the way  we could take  calls all day  just want to  acknowledge all the  people calling  from Michigan  today  you guys  were unbelievable  the show  was awesome  the Detroit  show is amazing  it's coming in  like crazy  on instant  feedback  great time  look look  here's another  one  Chris real  fast go  ahead  hey what's  going on  guys  hey  how are you  see this is  why we're not  taking these  calls by the way

[01:42:00]  band  you get it  yeah that's  that's pretty  much what he was  watching yeah  well I think  that's part of  the tape  and again  not the infomercial  the infomercial  was a lot more  cheesier I guess  than the actual  tape  these dancers  are in the best  shape on earth  but they always  dance they dance  for six hours a  day  yeah these aren't  like the people  that are doing  this at home  like sending  away for it  yeah some fatty  from the middle  of Akron or  something is gonna  get this tape to  get her fat body  in shape like  these dancers  ain't gonna happen  my mother used to  do stuff like this  when I was growing up 
[01:42:30]  she would jog around  the house  my mother was a  psychopath  she would jog  around the house  she would jog  from room to room  like a little old lady  she would start in  the living room  and jog through  the kitchen  get the hell out of here  I swear to god  and she would jog  into the bedroom  because she had to  watch my sister  why wouldn't she  go outside  oh she had to  watch your sister  she had no friends  who could help her  out for an hour  and she would just  jog like into the  rooms around the house  and my mother would  just jog in the house  actual jogging  slow  putter walking  putter  walk putter  walk putter  it has to be slow  how big was your  house going on  yeah she wasn't sprinting 
[01:43:00]  she would jog  it was awful  that's hysterical  alright  and have a  Bailey's Irish cream  and have to sleep  with a cigar  I don't know  what that meant  alright here we go  Michael Irving  cries at  Hall of Fame  ceremony  we love the  crying athlete  yeah  the crying athlete  rules  here's Irving  introing his sons  and he starts  to sob a bit  I want to share  something with you  today  I have two sons 
[01:43:30]  Michael  he's 10  and Elijah  he's 8  Michael and Elijah  could you guys  stand up for me  that's my heart  right there  that's my heart  when I'm on that  threshing floor  I pray  I say God 
[01:44:00]  I have my struggles  and I made some bad  decisions  but whatever you do  whatever you do  stop whining  don't let me mess  stop  and yes  Jimmy  it's Michael  Irvin  I always pronounce  the G  I'm an idiot  the kids must have 
[01:44:30]  been so awkward  like alright  do we sit now  now I can stand up  and watch dad  babble like this  that's my heart  shut up  it must be great  to be an athlete  you retire  and you get this  whole thing  the rest of us  we get a stupid  gold watch  and a box  for our crap  watch the guy  that's coming in  throw your stuff  out  all your ideas  out in the dumpster  not even a watch  maybe  maybe like dinner  with your fellow  employees  and half of them  can't even show up  because they have  better things to do  than go to your  retirement party  go home and see  your wife 
[01:45:00]  with a vacuum  cleaner on  and her shoes  askew  as she's just dead  there's a great line  in that movie  about Nicholson  he goes  yeah I hate  my wife's smell  my wife's smell  bothers me  just like her skin  or her whatever  it's so funny  Bout Schmitt  is one of the  funniest movies  if you look at it  not meant to be  if you watch it  differently  god  I told the story  when I saw that movie  I was laughing so hard  in the theater  old ladies were getting  really really mad  of course  so pissed off  but it was so ridiculous 
[01:45:30]  you had to laugh  everything went wrong  for the poor guy  the best though  was when he retired  and the new guy  was coming in  and he's trying to  give him some  advice  about the job  and the new guy  doesn't want to hear it  and then he goes  and all these files  that he's been saving  for 30 years  30 years of his life's work  in this place  and you know  he actually told the guy  you know  I got a lot of stuff here  maybe you can use  make your job easier  the transition easier  all my files  all the research I did  in this place 
[01:46:00]  all of his work  and then as he's leaving  he's passing the dumpster  out back  and all those files  are in the dumpster  his life's work  they just threw it away  you are nothing  wasn't it awkward  that he's sitting there  talking to the guy  about you could do this  and the guy's like  okay yeah no I'm cool  the guy's being polite to him  which made it even worse  yeah made it more like  that's how somebody  would really deal  with the situation  you know  yeah yeah be all cool  but then when he leaves  it's like  and then it's one thing  after another  then he goes home  and his wife 
[01:46:30]  yeah is dead  with the shoe off  the vacuum cleaner's going  and then  she was just vacuuming  the house  and keeled over  see I started watching  that morning  that movie  and I was in shock  in the beginning  but by the time  he's in the RV  and now what  he's driving cross country  to see his daughter  who doesn't give a crap  about him  yeah  and then when he stops  in front of where  his childhood home  his childhood home  and before they even  showed the childhood home  in quotes here  I started laughing  because I knew  that had to be  some horrific thing too  and it's a tire store  and the guy's like 
[01:47:00]  yeah I guess you could  come in  and he's kind of like  reminiscing  and like trying to figure out  where his bedroom  used to be  in this tire store  and the guy's in the  background selling radials  to somebody  oh I howled  it was so funny  the house had been  gone for years  they'd knocked it down  and built a tire store  his childhood home  that film is funny  alright here's more  Michael Irvin  still talking  about his son  with his sons  I guess  you can hear Irvin  choking up here  I asked  I said please  help me 
[01:47:30]  help me raise them  for some young lady  so that they can be  a better husband  than I  uh oh  help me  help me raise them  for their kids  so that they  could be a better father  than I  and I  tell you guys  to always  do the right  thing  so that you  can be a better 
[01:48:00]  role model  than that  I was wondering  if that was getting  old  it's not getting  old  yeah  I love the laugh  what an awful  speech  yeah  this is terrible  Emmett  how about thanking  your offensive line  stupid  yeah talk about  the game  keep that  crap to yourself  when you're talking  privately with your  kids  you're going into  the hall because  of Nate Newton  and Eric Williams  and Larry Allen  and all those guys  that would give  Aikman 45 minutes 
[01:48:30]  to throw passes  so you could stop  and have a Gatorade  and then tap dance  in the end zone  for an hour  how about thanking  the offensive line  Larry Allen  was an animal  oh he's the worst  we got some great  stories from our  pal there  Tyson yeah he said  Larry Allen would  chew tobacco  and then spit  the gunk  on the floor  of his passenger  seat in his  Mercedes  just an animal  he was a savage  he was unbelievable  that he was saying  here's the final clip  from Michael Irvin  I sat 
[01:49:00]  right here  where you are  last year  and I watched  the class of 2006  Troy Aikman  Warren Moon  Harry Carson  Rayfield Wright  Rayfield Wright  John Madden  and the late  great  Reggie White  represented by his  wife  Sarah White  and I said  wow  that's what a 
[01:49:30]  hall of famer  is  it's tight  boring  certainly I am  not that  and I doubt it  stop it  I would have a chance  to stand before you  today  so when I  returned home  I spoke with  Michael and  Elijah  and I said  that's how you  do it son  you can act  like a man  you do it  what's the matter  with you  like they did it

[02:00:00]  tell ya  goosebumps  every time  goosebumps  Dave I gotta  ask you  what was  going on  through your  head when  that happened  sure I'd be  happy to talk  about that  what it was  was it was  a fan fest  in Spartanburg  South Carolina  back around  November 2005  they had a lot  of the older  wrestlers there  as a matter of  fact I'm going  to a fan fest  in Charlton  North Carolina  this week  too  the NWA  Legends  which is  gonna be  great  who's gonna  be there  who's the  big get  for that  one  they're gonna  have  Midnight Express 
[02:00:30]  Luger  gonna have  a whole bunch  of folks  Ole  Orn  Anderson  JJ Dillon  is gonna  be there  a lot  of folks  JJ Dillon  yeah  to me  to name  if I  might  like I  said  I'm just  going  as a  fan  I had  to pay  but  it's  the  nwalegens  dot com  if anybody  wants to  take a look  but it's  just gonna  be a great  gathering  for sure  now  how did  you get  so emotional  at that  point  did you  know  you were  gonna  get that  emotional  where'd  that come  from  I'll continue 
[02:01:00]  on  being that  it was  the fan  fest  and a lot  of the  older wrestlers  were there  whenever I  first showed  up  and first  got there  I saw  Harley Race  getting out  of a car  and he  was really  walking  real rough  and everything  and I'm  thinking  good lord  this man  you know  gave his  body  for our  sacrifice  for our  entertainment  sure  for the  entertainment  and it  was the  week of  the fan  fest  in november  2005  was also  the week  when eddie  guerrero  passed away  yes  first day 
[02:01:30]  and nick  densmore  or eugene  or whatever  had just  been sent  home  from the  european  trip  for  well  let's  just  say  other  things  yeah  we all  know  that  yeah  that was  on my  mind  and then  i got  you know  because it  was  you know  that had  me kind  of upset  because i'm  seeing what  happened  and i'm  seeing bobby  eating  barely able  to get  around as  fast as he  used to  and he was  one of the  quickest guys  in wrestling  you know  the cornets  knees are  shocked  so this  started 
[02:02:00]  working on  you then  just seeing  these guys  started  working on  me  and then  i'm like  well i'm  going to put  out of my  head a little  bit  i'm going to  go out  there and  i'm going  to enjoy  myself  i got to  meet jerry  the king  the wall  or i got  to meet  my favorite  rest of the  barbarian  i get to  have some  fun  but then  they started  talking about  well tell  me this  you know  what what  would you  rather have  as your  if you could  have one  match  your favorite  match  what would  you like  and terry  funk mentioned  i'd like to  have one more  vitty guerrero  and then he 
[02:02:30]  started speaking  about certain  things like  well every  every city  in america  besides  spartanburg  has a  crack house  and if you  go back  and you  trace  the  deaths  in wrestling  or you  go back  and trace  the deaths  of that  crack house  in spartanburg  south carolina  the last five  years  you'll find  that pro  wrestling  has had  more in  the last  five years  than that  crack house  and  with the  been  watch  tragedy  and everything  a lot  of this  has come  to light 
[02:03:00]  because i  mean  that had  me a little  choked up  that there  are so many  deaths  in wrestling  and it  looked like  the wwe  wasn't  you know  they got  their wellness  policy  but you can  get around  that with  a prescription  you can go  out  and you  know  as long as  you've got a  doctor  and a lot of  stuff like that  but it seems  that so little  was being done  about it  and no one  really gave a damn  about these  wrestlers  and i wanted  to stand up  but at least  thank you  for what 
[02:03:30]  they did  sure  right  and you  man you  made a  moment  huh there  uh well  unfortunately i guess  i got a little  too choked up  right there  but if nothing  else you know  i'm uh  i can take it  and of course  you can take it  you're it's now  a catchphrase  it's on t-shirts  uh you have a  website dedicated  to this right  oh yeah  it's still wrote  to me dot com  www  still wrote to me  dot com  and how weird  is it uh  dave you now  have fans  i mean they're  calling in now  we got fellow  wrestling fans  calling in 
[02:04:00]  they can't believe  we're talking  to you  that's very  bizarre and  everything uh  believe me i'm  just a guy  i'm you know  go to work  every day  what did you  mean by  it's still  real to me  well at that  time i was  thinking back  to when it  wasn't a lot  of this sports  entertainment where  they weren't  doing stupid  stuff like  blowing up  cars with  vince mcmahon  in it  right  where it  wasn't a lot  of the nonsense  that you see  on the radio  you know  when you  didn't see  blatant  they had  great racial 
[02:04:30]  xenophobic angles  back then  a lot of  stuff was a  little more  toned down  it was more  believable  it seems that  you know  believability  is almost  totally gone  from wrestling  on the ufc  but for that  moment  that i got  to meet  some of my  favorite wrestlers  that i got  to speak  to some  of the  favorite  wrestlers  that by  sure  accident  i helped  raise awareness  of you know  the death  problem in  wrestling  and stuff  like that  and i was  able to  assist in  doing that 
[02:05:00]  for that  day  i was the  7th grader  buying wrestling  books at the  time  sabre and  acworth  when i first  became a  fan  and you  shouldn't  downplay  we got a  lot of  people on  the lines  that want  to talk  to you  about this  they were  moved by  your clip  and they  understand  what's  going on  we got  this guy  from  yellowstone  steve  let's put  him on  with  yellowstone  let's put  him on  with 
[02:05:30]  dave  wills  steve  how are  you  sir  hello  yeah  what's  up  steve  can you  hear me  is this  david  hey steve  how you  doing  hi  how are  you  i'm a  little bit  i'm a  little bit  nervous  actually  i'm actually  talking to  someone like  you to be  a celebrity  boy has  the word  celebrity been  cheap in  the last  few years  i couldn't  hear you  i'm on  an iphone  surprising me  the reception  is not  good  indeed  indeed  what can 
[02:06:00]  you do  for  i get  laughed  at a lot  because  i'm  such  a  wrestling  fan  and people  will always  tease me  and say  that it's  homoerotic  entertainment  but i  happen  steve  you there  yes i am  i'm just a  little bit  nervous  i'm certainly  not doing  anything  behind the  scenes  take it  easy  buddy  yeah  take it  easy  that's what  they told  you  dave  i remember  that  what do  you think  it is  about  wrestling  that you  like  so  much  at one 
[02:06:30]  time  they had  storylines  like  oh my  goodness  you know  sometimes  you get  callers  that are  sometimes 
[02:07:00]  the callers  get through  the screeners  i'm sorry  i'll tell you  what isn't  real to  damon  um  well at least  somebody's  playing  wrestling  deaths  should be  accompanied  by a  laugh track  that isn't 
[02:07:30]  uh  hello  hello  uh dave  yeah  dave  sit  ups  god damn  jimmy  sit  ups  ah  well  can we get  dave back  on the phone  no  can we get  dave back  on the phone  no i don't  want to hear

[02:23:00]  grinder and a leash and a cup i said we put them in the middle of a  mosh pit make chimp noises i could beat up 10 000 primordial  you would be like uh hercules to them when does it get to the point where you  can't beat them up anymore because you're just tired because they just  keep coming and coming from all directions how many you think you could  take out how many oh no man your muscles are going to get tired after a 
[02:23:30]  while they can't do anything to you all right but they can hit you as hard as  they want you could take a break you could sit there and just go  look take a break no but what are they gonna do here's the bit though  they keep coming and coming and coming when do you finally lose the battle  if somehow they can suffocate you it's pretty much it but you could wait  until they're climbing up your body and if you don't die from freaking out  at those those creatures crawling on you you just shake like a dog shakes 
[02:24:00]  water they're off you and then you just start kicking i would kick i say after  about 10 000 it gets a little tougher you're a little 10 000 your reaction  isn't as good and you're slowing down a little bit now at that point do you lay  on your back and just start kicking no no you don't get on the ground because  now you're on that's the weakness you gotta keep the high ground i'd step on  them because you can lift your leg up and just start stepping on them or kick  them and they they'd go like bowling pins i think step on a thousand things 
[02:24:30]  though i'm telling you after a couple hundred you're starting to get a little  tired yeah but then what if they're coming at you then what you're all  adrenaline i'm like one into the other just start start being them you ever see  the wanderers when there's that fight and perry's father is swinging the ducky  boy oh yeah ducky boys see pick a couple up yes and swing them around your arms  gonna get tired use them they're light do like a cheerleader routine swing and  stomp like you know oh you're non-humans not even people non-humans not even people 
[02:25:00]  just stomp and swing sweet salad from rhode island thank you like matrix too  they're just they're they just keep coming and coming when do you finally lose the  battle you're gonna lose eventually  if 10 000 come at you you could you could kind of pace yourself and know you only got  10 000 agent smith style but they just keep coming and coming when do you lose the  battle and how i got it you said it here's how you beat them you set a trap for them  you take a giant glue trap and you put a sign on the front that says become a real person here 
[02:25:30]  and they all run in to become real people i think i'm sure they have to stand on like  an x or something to become this real person well no it's just a room they just run into  the room and they just get stuck in the glue trap oh that's nice yeah there's only so many  fit in a room though jimmy then what me a bunch of rooms help me help me like the fly  throw a rock on him brundle douche  hey let's go to cara cara's got a very interesting question today we're gonna take a lot of phone  calls today cara jersey what's up hey uh yesterday was my boyfriend's birthday and

[02:30:00]  tall they are freakish alien looking things yeah they're very like they're squishy like they they  look like their parts are squished in a little bit like those twisty cats  what's a twisty cat twisty cat it was like a big news story uh uh several years ago where this  woman was breeding these cats that didn't have front paws the bones were missing from the front 
[02:30:30]  paws they were genetic defects that she was purposely breeding and they hopped like kangaroos on their  back feet missing both how great is that how cute and why was she why was she doing this she thought  they were adorable i'm looking at twisty cats a quick google and there you go you can look at twisty  cats thanks to doug stanhope see and what they hop primordial dwarfs oh go to primordial dwarf in  your google yeah yeah take a look at one of these you've never seen anything more rapable

[02:32:00]  want but they keep on coming there's not like a certain amount like it's not like you against  10 000 they just keep coming when do you finally lose the battle with the primordial dwarfs uh you  know what i can't imagine them actually like once they got to you like how would they i can't i can  only imagine them like giving you like this slobbery hickeys or something yeah but just  basically imagine biting and punching and kicking you now they'd be easy to kick away i think but if 
[02:32:30]  they're all coming at you from all angles you'd have to start helicoptering a few around i think  one of us one of us break all right yeah so we're talking about primordial dwarfs and twisty cats  today with doug stanhope what's up doug hey good morning uh yeah i'm i've got my uh fake i'm awake 
[02:33:00]  voice on yeah sort of way are you in new mexico yeah arizona i'm at home okay also it's pretty early  yeah yeah so we're on uh dirty talk ona yeah this is filthy language uh radio it's good old filthy  talk fantastic just yeah hey we had chris hansen on we were trying to get a hold of you but uh it  didn't work out unfortunately yeah that was a wednesday i have these these wednesday drunk dial 
[02:33:30]  nights now because i got last comic standing followed by chris hansen so it's like this double  whammy of hate i drink through it and then i just i try to vlog but i can't spell so i just call  people and go you might believe this shit god damn it yeah you don't like chris hansen oh no that  guy's just self-important fucking douche hole like self-important douche oh yeah he's awful that show  this fucking kills me like it's worse fear-mongering than even terrorism because 
[02:34:00]  parents get so into that oh well if you watch that show you'll see that these pedophiles are more of a  problem yeah if your kid's sitting online going hi uh yeah hi random 55 year old dude i've never met  my name's britney i'm good i'm rubbing baby oil on myself by the pool god i wish i had a wine cooler  i live at 125 washington avenue christ i wish you'd just stopped by if you're yeah if you make 
[02:34:30]  yourself a pedophile's wet dream yes it's such fucking horrible entrapment like i'm not i don't  think entrapment entrapment though is like come on if you're getting somebody to like approach you  as a pedophile it's almost like you can't trick a non-pedophile into trying to fucking a 13 year old  well maybe you can't first of all fucking well pedophile it means someone who wants to fuck  pre-pubescent kids that that's when you get a fucking hot chick like they have on there and they 
[02:35:00]  you know well you know what can i jump in uh uh patrice o'neill was in and uh he kind of made the  point that they're making these uh these girls these decoys just short of fuckable and patrice is  like if you really want to do this why don't you do it with 10 and nine and nine year olds but they're  trying to kind of they're kind of like tapping into the i hate to say it's sort of the hotness of the  whole thing that it's a it's a 13 it's a 14 it's in that weird age for it don't apologize for it were 
[02:35:30]  you 14 once did you want to fuck okay then right did you know what you're doing yes you did basically  what patrice was saying you know they know exactly what they're doing by using that that weird age  there you know i mean if they really did it with like uh eight and nine year olds it would be so  creepy no one would yeah then you would just want to like shoot the guy when he walks in the door  yeah then you'd have a serious still wrong obviously i don't want to be jumping on the radio saying that  you know i'm condoning this but i mean i think patrice made a pretty interesting point you know 
[02:36:00]  because if you really want to take care of this problem you know set you know set it up with eight  or nine year olds but do they do predators really catch eight or nine year olds i think most pedophiles  or whatever probably don't go after eight or nine year olds online because the communication skills  aren't there like a 12 or 13 year old can sneak out meet you somewhere have a relationship online i  don't think an eight or a nine year old can i mean i mean it's i they got to be taken from the house  yeah i think most times you got to meet them and most pedophiles or most victims of pedophilia 
[02:36:30]  they know they're they're attacker you know it's a family member it's not someone they met online  because again you you don't if you teach your kids even though the most basic skills we grew up  without the internet and there were just as many pedophiles they we just didn't have the internet  and your parents dealt with it by talking to you they'd go hey don't talk to strangers some of them  might want to fuck you and you go thanks dad i'm going to log that information in my brain and that's 
[02:37:00]  why you didn't you know get fucked by a stranger that's why you got fucked by your uncle they never  said don't talk to your uncle but but yeah if you have just the most minimal parenting you're not  going to do that online but it's also hard go ahead okay i'm good i say it's also hard because  it's like online you really think you're talking to a 13 year old in person you know you're talking  to a strange adult like they'll say don't go up to strangers but you kind of know you're talking  your parents never say to you when you're a kid never talk to somebody else your age who's a stranger 
[02:37:30]  they encourage you to make friends so it's like online it's a little bit different because you  a lot of times think you're talking to somebody who's 12 or 13 but you're really talking to a guy  who's 50 that's the difference is the anonymity typically you don't have in person that you have  online i i would love to do a reverse thing with like a a 35 year old woman saying god i really want  to get laid by a 14 year old boy and just bust all the sea of 14 year old boys who show up  shove their dicks out you just touch their penises with lit match heads and say dirty boy 
[02:38:00]  and then watch what happens to them in 20 years condoms what were you planning on doing  it's such a it's such a double standard though man i mean you know women sleeping with uh boys of  14 or 15 we barely we barely blink when those stories hit the paper hey by the way by the way  squeaky wheel writes uh hanson explained that it's not entrapment because they do not approach the  pedos the pedos reach out to the plants unprovoked he did make that point on our show but even if 
[02:38:30]  even if they didn't even if they didn't you couldn't entrap me into having sex with a 10 or  11 year old you just couldn't do it because it's not what i want to do like i always kind of believe  in entrapment but in a way i don't like if you're gonna do it man you're gonna do it yeah it's like if  they if they put dope on the table as if they yeah as a weak analogy but if they put a hundred  dollar bill on a bus bench and if they've vilified fees as much as they do pedophiles they go oh this 
[02:39:00]  person they they pocketed the hundred dollar bill all right if you're gonna wave it around like that  you're gonna get takers but don't act like it's this epidemic that it's not well i'll tell you the  thing is though like with a hundred i mean i know i know you acknowledge a hundred dollar bill is kind  of an odd thing but it's like you know a hundred bucks is something anybody can use fucking a child  is something only a small percentage of the population comprehends most of us don't like  work 40 hours a week to fuck a child i said most of us you know occasionally it's a it's a fun thing 
[02:39:30]  and a stress relief who am I to judge asterisk and i know this borders on a nambla argument but  at what point are you an adult nature gives you the ability to bear children to be a parent  at roughly 13 years old at what point i and and the government says you're not even ready to drink  a beer till you're 21 like at what point is it bullshit like naturally you don't want to fuck  someone way out of your age range that's natural i don't want to fuck a 15 year old for the same 
[02:40:00]  reason i don't want to fuck a 70 year old i have nothing to say to them you know but  i'll take the 15 year old over the 70 exactly hey reverend uh writes from north carolina just  tell doug to shut up and view it as entertainment i think even nbc would admit that it's gotten uh  past the awareness stage of this show but it does probably scare pedophiles though i guarantee you  that that has changed the way they do things maybe i mean i guarantee you there's less guys doing it 
[02:40:30]  because they're like fuck that man you can talk but you can't go over at least less guys doing it  that way yeah hey doug yeah find a nice new way doug you got that computer go to uh break.com and  type in to catch a chris hansen he came in and anthony did chris hansen to chris hansen it was  really really funny really good you're gonna want to check that out oh by the way i just gotta  acknowledge something i didn't i didn't intentionally try to steal a uh a ron bennington bit so relax  about what fighting things like but it's people are just getting a run oh relax i wouldn't try to 
[02:41:00]  first of all i wouldn't try to like just casually steal a ron bit we traded that bit for big a and  uh stalker patty there you go i'm the one that mentioned that not ope and i've never heard ron  do that bit i i mentioned i mentioned i could beat up 10 000 of them yeah ron talks about uh beating  up kids oh really kids or uh animals i love ron it's like how would you fight a giraffe oh you 
[02:41:30]  gotta choke him big neck you can't punch him in the face it's too high so ron's got his logic on how to  beat things up but we're talking about primordial dwarves and you know and they just keep coming  like the matrix matrix too so whatever dude i didn't try to steal a ron bit so relax exactly you'll  hear about this all my gymatorial yes give the gymatorial what doug i'm sorry man i just got i  had to free up the instant feedback there doug because they're writing in like crazy and i i want

[02:44:30]  where they go child pornography is rampant on the internet and like why don't i ever see it but i've  seen cock fingering like i have a if you go to my message board there's a there's a thread called  the tsunami of poon where people just post like the most horrible pornography they can find and i've  like yeah there's just stuff shoved down the cockhole i've seen several times i've seen it just  wandering the internet just clicking on oh i used to see a dominatrix and she would uh you know 
[02:45:00]  whatever old toilet games but she was talking about a doctor she used to see and what he liked  her to do was take a scalpel and put the scalpel in the tip of his cock and just hold it there and  then yank it out like not dig deep with it but just put the blade in all right and go and yank the  scalpel up and she said the thrill for this doctor because he knew it wouldn't permanently damage him  was that when he'd pee like for the next couple days he would feel it and remember that domination 
[02:45:30]  feel it and was talking about it like we've all like masturbate with shampoo and shit and something  happens where like a little gets in your pee hole and then all of a sudden you have to take a leak  like an hour or two later and it burns man what is that about by the way i don't know the inside  disease a fucking dick hole ain't meant for any fucking nothing dr sanjay gupta on line six  sanjay gupta my friend zuul he was this biker comic dog he was really funny he was just a fucking

[02:59:00]  that's what what's your call buddy i know i actually have a split cock oh why why oh it's awesome  why why it's hard to explain it's uh i actually do the sounding the shoving metal things in there  and stuff and if you split up a little bit you can fit more in oh that logic of course but rob you're  not explaining why like you're talking to a lot of guys right now and how does it get to a point where  you just how do you get to a point where you you decide i want to split cock i've seen i've seen 
[02:59:30]  a few pictures of the split cock and not even not even a thought of ever attempting this no yeah i  had a lot of gentle piercings i used to be a piercer for about four years i do sideshow performance now  and just seen a lot of guys just figured it'd be cool to do and i did it and i really enjoy it so  how'd you do it how'd you split your cock uh it's uh it's a underground surgeon type of guy  and it's just a scalpel you cut and you sew the sides together and it splits how much does that  hurt i gotta i gotta see three people just to get a xanax prescription 
[03:00:00]  you know that's a tough one to write off for insurances and medical necessity i had to get my  dick split do you have to use a rubber weird to have like some kind of fetish or whatever like that that  even me and norton go i don't get it yeah what the fuck i can see a little log in the mouth is  how do you fuck with a split dick you carry around rubber bands so it's you know i still get hard 
[03:00:30]  still normal but it's not tip like in the end it's sort of hold on dude but when it gets hard what the  fuck's going on it's split oh no it's not split all the way so it's still like a hot dog in a  microwave type of thing yeah but what about the tip like that doesn't get hard right  don't you feel like yeah blood flow still goes there and aren't you worried that right now it's  like a moray eel well i'm i'm thinking if it's split already and you're having sex aren't you  worried that the damn thing's gonna tear uh no not really i mean it's fully healed up so 
[03:01:00]  we've all you know we've all went for that piece of skin on the side of our nail and decided oh i  could i could take this off next thing you know you got a long red strip all the way down to your elbow  ow ow i'm just thinking having a lot of sex with a split cock you know that it's got a tear  well also sex feels a lot better because your urethra yeah it's real sensitive so sex just feels a  lot better for me as well i love that sex feels better sex is great the way it is i don't have to 
[03:01:30]  chop my cock into rob we're really trying to get into your brain here though uh chris on long island he  asked and i we asked and you're still not helping us out here he goes what makes people do this  like all right there's a ton of people that do piercings yeah just one step further  that's more than one yeah it's almost a slippery slope theory i'm not going to split it anymore i  mean i like where it is now but just something different i really enjoyed it so good thing 
[03:02:00]  it's almost like cutting your dick off or like wanting to cut your dick off almost  yeah you have to have it done yeah dude you have a new dick right into that too and i'm not into  that yes yeah we did the amputee fetish on the show it's hilarious wait sir let me ask this i don't get  like you know how when you come and you're pissed there's a hole there's like the urethra how do you  avoid splitting that like how do you not going to cut it like a straw oh no no the urethra is split  it's up here do you come like a blender bus well yeah i come all right so let's i guess i'm gonna 
[03:02:30]  be dropping sex them so girl girl gives me uh pleasure with her mouth uh you could say whatever  you want she gives you a fucking blow job exactly give me a fucking blow job you know i come  fucking come on the chin she doesn't have to swallow it just hits her face automatically  because uh the shoot the actual holes near the base near the balls somewhat so it actually  the hole so you did it to be a gentleman hello a gentleman you you you come out of the hole that's 
[03:03:00]  kind of near your balls oh no i mean the urethra goes all the way in so yeah i'm on the urethra i'm  still at work yeah but when you shoot you're shooting like halfway down your dick yeah pretty  much all right that's fucked up right there she must look like she's wearing a a scuba regulator  sucking both halves of your cock going over her teeth one way the other

[03:04:00]  didn't come out and uh the mom had to go in and she tried pulling it and tried tried getting it out  out anyway he ended up at the uh the hospital and they had tweezers trying to go pick this thing  out man but uh pretty crazy there's some so uh so you can push it in and but it could also get stuck  we're learning today as a kid maybe she should have put her mouth over it and like given some  suction and that probably would have popped it back out well she should have put things in his 
[03:04:30]  asshole and push them in and out really quickly happened a fucking screwdriver and a hammer flicked  his nipple showed him tinkle videos till his little weenie just popped out naturally so doug how's  butters i don't i just see him on my message board i i don't i don't uh i don't go out when i'm in town  but uh he sends me emails saying he wants to come over and make us tamales and i i i don't uh i don't write  back you're not hanging with butters these days huh yeah butters doesn't understand i don't really

[03:10:30]  that so when i was like 10 i was into 10 year old that's how it worked so i think when i was about 10  years old i had this fantasy of a girl that was about about four inches tall totally naked and i wanted  to put her in my mouth and then just pull her out of my mouth and kind of suck on her like a lollipop  you wanted to be danny from the shining i said tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth she's  a little whore that lives in my throat but i wanted to do that with her completely naked but really

[03:11:30]  i you know thought it was cool what's that about i don't know story about that wait a minute i think  really that is okay i'm sorry oh no bukowski had a short story called six inches i believe where it  was about how his girlfriend told him he was fat and told him how to punch himself in the sides to  lose his love handles and he gradually got smaller and smaller till he was only six inches and then she  used to fuck herself with him but uh my story i think that anthony's i want to know that's what i 
[03:12:00]  want to know of anthony's uh dream that the little girl you were putting in your mouth was she standing  like in a thatch of grass with two beanbag chairs in front of her  no it was a girl not a weenie and it was just the thought that like i would feel 
[03:12:30]  all of a naked uh girl's body all on my tongue at the same time like her ass her stomach legs  everything all at the same time and that was like like a kid fantasy i had okay terrific  it went away after a while i thought it was pretty cool for a kid hey uh i thought it was  pretty cool for a kid little fantasy it's wrong it's matter it's just weird it is weird i'm not  saying it's not weird all right you guys blow kids under the porch all right listen that's what i'm

[03:26:00]  way when it first happened to me i had to go every week for six months to have this dog nine rods one  one that starts as the size of your pinky the whip i'm talking right right kind of stretch it yeah  they stick it in and they like fucking twist it to stretch it back open because the tissue on the  head scars back down so now they got me to a month what uh the name of the condition it's called  urethra dilation now i was doing research on it on the internet to like so i can show people what the 
[03:26:30]  fuck i go through because everybody says to me oh it can't be that bad and if you and you know the  only documentation on the internet is like doctors pictures and books rather of drawings and they just  show like a little stick inside the dick hole which is fucking you know ponderous compared to what they  do to me it's it's crazy guys dude how'd you know there was a problem like you would try to piss and  what your dick would blow up like a balloon you want or you want to get into it i'll get into it  i'll try to be as quick as possible one morning after a long night of drinking i woke up dude could 
[03:27:00]  not fucking piss i fucking looked down i'm weary headed i got a hangover my hole was gone just gone  not there no more it's just gone wow it's like your piss hole was gone it was over yeah it was  like somebody fucking turned it off it was gone i guess you know it's kind of like when you uh you  had an earring and you decide the earring wasn't cool anymore so you took it out and then like the  earring comes back it's cool again so you're like you know what i have an earring hole i'm gonna 
[03:27:30]  fucking put my earring back in and then you realize that earring was gone and you gotta poke it  through your piss hole disappeared i swear to god this is no i mean i went to the emergency room  mind i'm drinking all night so my bladder feels like it's going to explode so they take me in right  away to the emergency room i and it was the most embarrassing thing of my life i got two nurses  and a fucking doctor who looked like an intern trying to use a scalpel to reopen the hole i'm sitting  there with me they're like here control your morphine drip i'm like okay but turn that 
[03:28:00]  fuck her up as much as i can and i'm fucking high as hell and i got my poor pregnant wife sitting  next to me drop this whole thing and they finally were about to wheel me into the or to cut my belly  open i guess to put a catheter in that way and then thank god luck fucking the urologist on call  walked in there threw everybody out of the room and he was able to get a catheter in me drained like  fucking two bags of fucking pissed out of me and then put a catheter in me for three days i went to 
[03:28:30]  his office he did the procedure for the first time and let me tell i cleared out his waiting room  because i was fucking screaming so loud oh wow it's horrendous man i mean if i don't know what  causes it it just happens it happens mostly in older gentlemen let's say that maybe go through it  once a year just to make sure everything is okay i'm 33 years old no i'm 32 years old this happened to  me when i was 28 29 there's no drug in the world that could prevent you from screaming on that thing 
[03:29:00]  well i mean they know oh here take a couple of viking before you come in you know that'll help and  they they inject laticane in to numb it up it which it works for the first two rods and then that's it  forget it as long as i've been doing it you know it's over two years now you think i'd be used to it  you ain't getting used to it no matter what will it heal eventually they don't they say that it can  be cured with surgery i guess they they stitch it open somehow but this doctor's saying to me that  well you're a young guy if you fuck it up and it don't work then you're gonna have to come here every 
[03:29:30]  fucking week for the rest of your life i'd rather wait and i'm thinking how much longer do you want  to wait dude it's been like two years it was two years in may how much longer do you want to wait  because this is starting to get you know out of hand just have an implant a straw or something in  there like one of the ones where you can bend the neck like yeah bendable straws bendable straws  how comfortable you think that would feel guys i mean i mean better than what you're going through  ever offer at this point but i mean that can't be comfortable i don't think too bad that's like um 
[03:30:00]  you would have won the what the hell is that competition oh hell yeah that's a that's a big  disappearing piss hole disappearing piss hole beats everything magic tell me that i'll come in  there with a fucking rod tomorrow and shove it in okay give you a buck how much rod can you take at  this point these things i'm telling you i have pictures of my fucking email with travis whoever  i have pictures of rods i'm telling you they're 12 inches long and the longest one the girth i'm 
[03:30:30]  telling you it's wider than your thumb picture you look at your thumb and just think of of it round  totally round and he jams them in like all the way i mean it's like touch it's got to be touching  my bladder at this point it's not comfortable i was going to come into that for a while because  they had me doing it every week and then they were like well come back every two weeks  but here's an at-home kit you can use and i'm like what they're like oh do it every two days i'm like 
[03:31:00]  okay so they give me this little plastic one it's probably about you know four or five inches long and  it starts off from skinny and it gets to be probably about the width of your index finger  maybe and my wife was doing it to me because i can't fucking do it myself see again this is a  perfect place for dominatrix health care good luck to you it would be way better after some chicken  latex skirt was making you eat her ass while she i'm gonna jam this down your cockle if you don't  eat my ass good it would be better i don't think it was gonna be good enough for the uh what the hell

[03:34:30]  all right want to thank doug stanhope for checking in today we were going to play the uh the x games  boarder uh jake brown yeah he was on good morning america this morning uh i'm sure everyone has seen  the video by not if if not go to youtube or break.com or wherever you go maybe i'm sure steve even has it  up on our sites uh everywhere the guy was what 50 feet in the air basically just under 50 feet pretty 
[03:35:00]  much yeah and he had a speed wobble is that what one of the skateboard experts told us when he hit  the lip he was going his board was going too fast the wheel started wobbling he lost his board and uh  just when it launched him and he was almost uh 20 feet above the top of the ramp yeah and that meant  another like close to 30 feet down it was just under 50 feet he fell i think the worst thing he did too  was he got away from the the wall itself yeah because usually you see these guys they wipe out 
[03:35:30]  they lose their board they hit the wall and kind of slide down it like they're hitting that little  slope yeah and they're all right and they're okay they even like like land on their knees yeah yeah  that it's gonna be all right seen that happen plenty of times this guy got out further than the wall  dropped and hit flat on the surface of the uh the bottom surface of the pipe and he was out cold right  oh yeah you got knocked out well here is his uh first interview with diane sawyer 
[03:36:00]  jake good morning to you how do you feel how  jake how do you feel how do you feel well you know let me tell you  i feel like uh i feel pretty good  how do you feel that dumb question what do you think diane  hey diane how does it feel not being young anymore and you're on hd tv it's probably the 
[03:36:30]  same feeling i have right now not too happy jake good morning to you how do you feel how sore are you  my muscles are pretty sore my back and neck and uh wrist i've been through a feel like a plane crash  i can't what are the doctors saying to you more surgery anything up to heal  i've got to have surgery on my wrist but that's the only thing that i know about so far for surgery  surgery where's he from made him talk funny too huh yeah fucked up his uh speech pattern 
[03:37:00]  that's from jersey jake knew he was in trouble heading up the ramp  oh fuck didn't just stop yeah call time out stupid just jump off the board do something  you're heading back up the mega ramp and what the board starts wobbling you know you're in trouble then  yeah i was uh i was a little too far to the left when i landed the 720 so i tried to carve across 
[03:37:30]  to the right just there and then the g-forces pushed me into the wall see there i'm carving  to the right i'm trying to come back to the left the g-forces push me onto my board and then i got  shot you can see the g-forces push me onto my board there and then i just get catapulted from there  to the flat bottom and you're uh you're going 30 to 40 miles per hour and you know you know the  board's going to separate you know you're going to be entirely on your own airborne 
[03:38:00]  yeah well you have to use technique to keep the board with you and the only technique i had there  was survival so wow survival that was just dumb luck that guy's a youtube star though now oh yeah  you trade that right they're calling it like the agony of defeat but the guy is like well known now  yeah that's a good one you know everyone has seen this video the old agony of defeat guy on the uh 
[03:38:30]  wide world of sports yeah the ski jump that was a good one that was a lame one compared to this guy man  what are you doing with your feet what are you pedaling with your feet for  well i did that he's not asking that why does dumb broad who was like interviewed everybody what what  do you think diane he's his instinct yeah it's it's it's natural instinct to like just start like  doing everything you can to start he's trying to fly diane is what he's trying to do you idiot how 
[03:39:00]  about because you cunt i thought i was on a bicycle what a dumb question why don't you lay back put your  hands behind your head and float down the fuck when you're falling he's petrified when you're falling  from a great distance your instinct is maybe i could fly it's worth a shot yeah yeah you're not  to lose you have nothing to lose exactly god she's such a dope what happened there he called her he  said why do you fuzz your lens and they cut him off where is it that's so i could keep my head above 
[03:39:30]  water oh okay here it is i've just got up let me start over here what are you doing with  your feet what are you pedaling with your feet for well i did that so i could keep my head above water  so my head would be above my legs just to keep my balance in the air and then uh i made the decision  to turn around backwards before i hit the ground so i would uh didn't go face first into the ramp you  know so you're actually planning the fall which is to hit your feet first then go down on your bottom
