<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about an upcoming Fox News segment on the show, followed by Opie sharing an embarrassing childhood story about retrieving gum from under desks.  The hosts then transitioned to listener feedback regarding their recent launch in Cleveland, noting a significant amount of overwhelmingly negative, vulgar, and offensive calls criticizing the show's talk-heavy format.  This was contrasted with positive feedback from their new Columbus affiliate.  A recurring segment featured calls from "Crazy Paul," a listener who initially disliked the show but became a fan, mirroring the experience of many early New York listeners.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on an upcoming "catfight" segment featuring amateur female fighters, including teenage girls.  The hosts detailed the rules (no punching or eye-gouging), discussed the potential for nudity, and engaged in graphic comparisons of potential injuries (e.g., a London broil in a dryer, a snow leopard in a chainsaw).  Melee, an organizer of catfights, was interviewed, providing details about upcoming events and promotional materials.  A caller, Aaron, described a violent catfight he'd witnessed at work.  Earl, an employee, repeatedly called to announce his resignation from a sticker shop, only to later retract it, providing comedic relief.  In-studio guests Jim Norton and Colin Quinn joined the discussion, alongside Melee, further elaborating on the catfights and promotional materials.  Warren Tong, a photographer for Penthouse and Playboy, was mentioned in relation to photos of Melee.  Melissa, a radio station promotional representative, called in mentioning aphrodisiac drinks.  Opie claimed he could guess a person's age by looking at their taint, leading to an explicit attempt to demonstrate this with Melee.  The segment also featured a detailed description of "The Den of Iniquity," a BDSM establishment, with a demonstration involving Jim Norton.  A brief glimpse of a catfight was shown, and the show promoted a live event at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and Optimum Online.

The broadcast continued with a live "catfight" outside the studio, improvised with a sheet and pillows. Two women, initially in unsexy pajamas, engaged in a staged fight involving hair pulling, hitting, and attempts to remove each other's clothing.  Melee joined later, displaying aggressive fighting skills.  The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive comments throughout the segment.  Colin Quinn and multiple camera crews, including Fox News, were present filming the event.  The show promoted a "Moms I'd Like to F" contest, featuring a young mother participant. Further catfights ensued, one involving a woman who identified as a professional in "edge play" with razors.  The upcoming road show was heavily promoted, including the catfight, a $1,000 wet t-shirt contest, musical acts like Dickie Betts, and other events.  Numerous callers participated, some reacting to the catfight, others promoting their own ventures.  Sponsorships and various aspects of the roadshow were discussed throughout.

In-studio "catfights," both real and staged, were featured, alongside numerous calls.  One caller, Consuelo, accused the show of racism, referencing jokes from *Blazing Saddles*, leading to a contentious exchange with the hosts and other callers making similar accusations or racially charged comments. A "What Did We Learn" segment summarized the show's often vulgar and offensive content.  The Stone Pony roadshow was heavily promoted, including catfights, a wet t-shirt contest, and various acts. Stacker 2 and Planet Java were promoted as sponsors. The "Moms I'd Like to F" contest continued, with photos and descriptions of contestants.  The show concluded with a discussion about a recently fired employee and an ongoing dispute with a show producer ("Earl") regarding promotional copy.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for today.  Let's give out the phone number.  Cameraman, please move away from my phone number. Thank you.  877-692-1027.  We have Fox News in the studio today, Anthony.  That's right.  Doing a little piece on the radio show.  In-depth expose on the Opie and Anthony show.  Always a treat when we have news in on our show.  Oh, yeah. Opie spilled his guts in an interview today. 
[00:00:30]  What did I do?  Well, you had to bring up back in school.  I don't even know how this came up.  Back in school to get attention.  Usually you'd tell jokes or kind of be funny or something.  You were a class clown, but for the fact that you used to peel gum off the bottom of desks and eat it.  For lunch money, yeah.  I felt like I had to give Fox something today.  You were like...  Something we haven't given all the other media outlets.  A suburban school version of a crack whore.  Pretty much.  You're getting the laughs and money by eating gum off of the bottom of desks. 
[00:01:00]  I've always been about getting a reaction, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yes, of course.  It was a bad reaction, but...  Well, you're going to hear this on Fox in a few days, but basically...  When class got really boring, I would make sure a lot of people were looking at me.  And then I would reach under the desk, pull out a nice hard piece of gum,  rip it off the bottom of the desk, and eat it for lunch money.  What if it was snot?  It was...  Is that like, you know what goes on under desks? 
[00:01:30]  Snot, earwax.  I'd rather not...  Bloody boogers.  I'd rather not think about it.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, no.  It's disgusting.  This is years ago.  And then the whole classroom would freak out, and the teacher would turn around,  and I would act like, what?  What?  What?  I'm just sitting here learning about some science.  And everyone would laugh.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah.  They were definitely laughing at me, not with me.  Great way to get attention.  So I shared that with Fox today.  That would be fun.  My parents are going to be proud.  And others.  Your parents must be proud. 
[00:02:00]  Cat fighting today, too.  Very excited.  Well, we should continue with this Fox thing.  They made us do the stupid walk.  Oh, we had to do the walk from our office to the studio.  So you could see that.  Are you going to get the little meters on the board?  You know how they show the little meters going, do, do, and you'll have a little voiceover  and the shiny red buttons on the board?  Oh, I'm sure.  That's usually a good thing.  I'm sure they'll add that to the piece.  And then you need the radio, the digital radio inside the car, and it's got to be tuned 
[00:02:30]  to the radio station here in New York.  That's always a good thing.  The camera is like a foot away from your head right now.  Yes.  Hi.  I know.  It's a little distracting, sir.  Just a tad.  Sir, who's a big fan of the show.  Sir.  Sir.  No one ever wants to fess up to that.  So that was fun.  Yeah.  We did that before the show today.  We also got to welcome our new affiliate, Anthony.  Brand new.  Brandy.  Shiny new affiliate. 
[00:03:00]  Columbus.  Columbus.  Hello.  Columbus.  The ONA virus is spreading all over the place, and it's now in Columbus.  Don't worry, Columbus.  You'll grow to love us.  On the big wazoo.  The big wazoo.  The big wazoo.  The real rock station.  Another rock station to the Opie and Anthony family.  That's good.  We love it.  We so win in the end, it's not even funny.  Who's going to see block us now that we're on like four or five rock stations?  We're going to have every single artist we want on our show. 
[00:03:30]  You think so?  Without a doubt.  We had a couple more rock stations.  You watch who ends up in this studio jamming with us.  You watch.  I'll believe it when I see it.  We've been C-blocked for three years by the midget across the street here in New York,  and he's going to lose this game.  Look at that.  We win again.  Whoops.  He's laughing, yet you talk about midgets.  The only bands we really have on this show are midget bands.  That band was fine.  Dwarfs, yes.  Yeah, I know.  They kicked ass.  The Little Kings, right? 
[00:04:00]  Columbus.  So hi to Columbus.  Hi.  And don't worry about it.  I can hear him already.  Dude, I've heard you now.  You've been on the air for 11 minutes.  You suck.  Get off.  You will grow to adore us.  That's right.  Just give us time.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Opie.  On your trip to the studio, were you riding your scooter?  Oh, no.  I gave that to Extra.  You've got to give them that shot, man.  I gave that one to Extra, coming down to the studio on a scooter. 
[00:04:30]  We don't ride the scooters from the office anymore.  Extra didn't air it, though, so you've got to do it again.  For Fox?  Yeah.  No.  You can ride the scooter.  I'm not riding no scooter down at the station.  It looked really stupid.  Huh?  It looked really stupid.  That's why they didn't use it.  Thank God.  So, all right.  Thanks, Joe.  All right.  Me, Crab.  Me, Crab.  Me, Crab.  Anthony, we should start by playing some reaction calls from Cleveland.  We started up in Cleveland yesterday on Extreme Radio. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  And I guess they have a comment line.  Would you like to hear some of the comments from our first show in Cleveland?  I guess we have to.  Now, this is one day in Cleveland.  Yeah.  And I guess not many positive reviews coming in after a day.  Oh, they hate us.  Oh, do they hate us in Cleveland already.  It takes a while.  You know, when you do that first skin popper of heroin, you might not enjoy it.  But before you know it, you're selling grandma's silverware to buy more. 
[00:05:30]  That's what this show is.  You're not going to like it at first.  Give it time.  Right.  But one guy was so obsessed with our show, he called the reaction line or whatever they call it in Cleveland, I don't know, five or six times.  He listened to the whole show even though he hated our guts.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they do.  It's pretty entertaining.  So let's go to that now.  If you need me to stop this, just tell me, okay?  You've reached the extreme comment line.  Leave your comment after the beep.  Whatever these morons are and you got on during the afternoon, get them off the air. 
[00:06:00]  They suck.  Orally, these two a**holes.  Get them off the air because it's boring.  You should play more extreme radio.  Get these guys off the air.  I like how it was when you did that little talk show.  Thanks.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Okay, you guys are, like, starting to suck, man.  You're like every other radio station with bull****.  We wanted to hear some extreme new music, not some extreme retard.  Extreme retard.  But we got to, like, listen to stupid talk shows. 
[00:06:30]  We're the host of music.  Hey, you guys almost had a pretty good station going through it.  I'm close.  You suck.  Hello?  Hello?  Uh, I guess MMS isn't so bad between the hours of 3 and 7.  I suck.  Play some f***ing music.  And my daughter wants to know, why do we have to listen to 105-7?  Why, I say, because 92 sucks now. 
[00:07:00]  Hey, what's up, man?  You guys f***ing rock, man.  Let me tell you something.  You know what I appreciate about your station?  You play good f***ing music every day, man.  It's all good.  And you know what?  You don't have a pompous jackass talking on the radio about himself, because that's the  last thing I want to hear.  I just want to hear the music, man.  Play the commercials, fine.  Give me the weather, fine.  But don't put jackasses on the radio talking.  I want to hear the music, man. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  That was almost a positive, right?  I didn't know where he was going at first, and then, yes, it was an insult.  What's up with you guys?  My dad's making me listen to the oldies, because you're playing a bunch of fruitcake talking  on the radio station.  Fruitcake?  Come on.  Where's the music at?  She was a ho-er.  I just want to leave you guys a quick comment.  I'm the same guy that called in and left a message asking what circles when a buzzard  died once in the past.  I got one new comment for you.  It took MMS 30 years to screw up the best station in Cleveland. 
[00:08:00]  You guys did it in a f***ing month.  Ouch.  This Opie and Anthony f***ing sucks.  To answer their question from the radio commercial, if they're so bad, how come they're on in  20 cities?  Because idiots like you guys keep putting them on the f***ing air.  Is that a consultant?  Is that a radio consultant?  I think that's our own boss here in New York, Ken Stevens.  Ouch.  How long is their goddamn contract for? 
[00:08:30]  How long do I have to put up with this?  The only thing I've not liked about you guys being in town was I missed the flat show in  the afternoon.  Guess what?  I got to hear it today, because that f***ing sucks.  All right, I'm feeling good.  We're worse than Alien Ant Farm.  We're worse than Alien Ant Farm.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, I just called in with them a minute ago chastising you guys for putting these  opening ants to be on the air, talking about how MMS took 30 years to ruin the best station  in Cleveland you guys took a month.  One qualifier I want to put on that. 
[00:09:00]  If these are f***ing only talking in between the music, it's not that bad.  I heard a song since then on the way home.  All I heard was them talking no music.  That's not as bad.  It's just out as New York station for music, not some f***ing talk about people eating  f***ing, licking, bloody f***ing, just gross f***ing.  Play some music in between and it's okay.  Don't play no music.  Take your f***ing station off the air.  He can't even describe it.  He can't even describe what we were talking about without being beeped.  There's some promise with this guy, though.  In the beginning of the message is he completely hated us. 
[00:09:30]  Now he's like, well, they're not too bad as long as they play in between the records.  Oh, in between songs.  But we're growing on him already.  Oh, do you think?  A little bit.  Please.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I wasn't feeling him.  Just a bit.  No way.  Hey, don't even f*** up your good radio with these two idiots talking all day.  I want to hear music, okay?  You guys are doing so great.  We want music from new people.  Don't f*** it up, please.  Thank you.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  How long is that talk show, O.B. and Anthony, going to be on?  It's the same guy.  You can listen to the whole show.  Talk about f***ing the moorant, man.  You guys are going to lose a lot of f***ing listeners with those f***ing bulls on.  O.B. and Anthony, suck the moorant, man.  Where'd you get those f***ing bulls from?  Goddamn bunch of f***ing losers.  You know what?  I like that guy.  I think he's got some potential. 
[00:10:30]  He's got potential.  He'll be on board.  Yeah.  It was the same damn call.  Yeah, listen to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, I'm in New York, and I remember when you guys started, I was saying the same stuff  because I miss the rock music, and now I'm a dedicated fan listening every day.  Where's Paul's call from NEW when we first came to New York years ago?  It is a carbon copy of everything you're hearing.  Of what we just heard.  Of what we just heard.  I mean exactly the same. 
[00:11:00]  Yo, get these jackasses off.  Open-ee and amphi-na-na-na-na-na-na-nee.  Shows you how much they know, because now you're syndicated in 22 markets, and you guys still rock.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Yeah, I got an interesting story to tell later about one of our new affiliates coming on board.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, my God.  You're going to die when you hear this one.  Ashley, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to call from Cleveland.  I said, I love your show.  It's hilarious.  Oh, thanks, Ashley.  Hey, look at that.  And I hope you stay on.  Well, we're going to stay on for a while. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, we'll be there.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Is this a call from, like, three years ago?  Yeah, this is Paul.  See if you can tell.  It's the same calls you just heard.  Now we can't lose them.  Hello, N.E.W.?  Yes, hi.  It's the program director.  No.  Who's this?  Okay, no.  I just have a little bit of a complaint.  All right.  Who's this?  Well, hi.  My name's Paul.  The two gentlemen that are on the radio now...  Paul, I'm just an intern.  Let me get the program director you want.  Yeah, or somebody, please.  Okay, hold on a minute, please.  I just want you guys to... 
[00:12:00]  Engineering.  Hi, Engineering.  How are you?  Could you guys do me a favor?  What's the problem?  I'll give you guys a hundred bucks cash under the table to pull a plug on them two blabbermouths.  I'll come to play some music.  Oh, you want programming?  This is Engineering, sir.  Oh, programming, please.  Oh, please hold.  Yeah, hello.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, do me a favor.  I'll give somebody in programming, whoever it is, I'll give them, like, five hundred bucks  under the table to shut these guys up for a little while, play some music or something.  What are you talking about?  This is the jock lounge. 
[00:12:30]  This is whose house?  The jock lounge.  Oh, the jock.  Where the DJs hang before they go on the air.  Oh, no.  They keep transferring me around.  I want to talk to somebody.  I mean, these guys are a little bit ridiculous today.  You know, let them...  They call themselves disc jockies.  Let them throw on some discs.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  You want the PD or the general manager?  I guess the program director would be fine.  I'm not going to bother the general manager.  Maintenance.  That's great.  You guys are great.  Okay.  Very funny.  That's pretty cool. 
[00:13:00]  Maintenance.  But, yeah, you guys keep ping-ponging me around.  Is there any way to shut those two dudes up?  You want programming, sir?  Sure.  All right.  I'll hang out and play the game.  Go for it.  Programming.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm trying to get...  I'm trying to talk to somebody to keep Tweedledum and Tweedledum and just a little bit quieter  and play some more tunes.  Is that possible?  Who's Tweedledee and Tweedledum?  No.  Tweedledum and Tweedledum.  And them two yahoos you got blabbered on the radio.  They sound like two old women from Long Island.  Is there any way to keep them quiet, you two Gs?  Just play a couple of more tunes? 
[00:13:30]  Is that possible?  So you're looking for programming?  I don't know who they got me looking for now.  Where am I?  What did I get now?  I apologize.  We're having a problem with the phone system.  Can you hold on one last second?  Hey, no problem.  I'm cool.  All right.  Hold on.  You've reached 1-900 Suck My Gs.  On Gay Male Sex.  If you like big fists up your a**, stay on the line.  You'll get a hot a** right in your mouth to blow a**. 
[00:14:00]  All over that face of yours.  See?  Didn't it sound just like the Cleveland calls?  The Cleveland calls.  We've only been on in Cleveland for one day.  And there you go.  That's a call that came in three years ago when we first started in New York.  And that guy, still listening to our show, and he's now on the line.  Crazy Paul, what's up?  Yeah, Anthony.  See the difference?  This is my worst friggin' nightmare. 
[00:14:30]  I've seen him with the guy.  First of all, you've got to understand something.  People in Cleveland, Philly, understand something.  When these guys came to New York, we didn't know what we were getting.  They promoted them as disc jockeys.  You guys are already up from the get-go.  You know what you're getting.  You're getting the best goddamn show in America.  With imbeciles like me helping out, and Psycho Mark, Ben, and of course that friggin' son of a bitch.  Ow!  I'm going to kill you!  Ow!  Anyway, Cleveland, deal with it.  You're going to have to. 
[00:15:00]  You're going to be closet fans like I was.  I started calling up a couple months later on the 74 different names.  I love these tons of bitches.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Thank you, Paul.  All right.  Thank you.  See, that's the guy that called up that was offering money to shut us up when we first got here.  Now look at the enthusiasm.  It's like falling asleep next to the bean pod in the Invasion of the Body's Mansion.  You fight it and fight it so hard, but when you wake up and you've been sleeping next to the bean pod, everything's fine. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And you hate the people that haven't slept next to the bean pod yet.  Remember that?  Yes, I do.  Lisa, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to call from Cleveland and let you guys know that I think you're wonderful.  Friends of mine from New York City have been sending me tapes of your shows, and I love you for years.  Softening up the beaches.  Yes, yes, yes.  And I wanted to tell you, those people that are calling and complaining can't be true Clevelanders.  All right.  They have to be from somewhere else.  Well, the guy wanted to hear his Pantera, and we weren't giving him his Pantera. 
[00:16:00]  Well, you know, he probably needs a lot more than Pantera.  All right, Lisa, thank you.  All right, thanks.  Enjoy.  All right, bye.  It's rough for some people when they're used to music.  You know, and then all of a sudden we're talking for four hours, and they're not used to it.  That's something new.  It's all right.  It'll catch on.  If it doesn't, there's plenty more radio stations to check out.  We all know that.  Anthony, I've got to play Brother Joe's parody.  It's unbelievable how much email we're getting.  And, you know, we're going to take a break here in a few minutes, but we should play this before we go to break. 
[00:16:30]  Everyone remembers the DMX song, right?  Yeah.  Joe did a James Taylor version.  If James Taylor would have done, y'all going to make me lose my mind.  Right.  So I'm going to play a little bit of DMX just to get everyone on board.  And then I want to, you know, follow it up with Brother Joe's version of the song, done.  Okay.  Done if James Taylor was doing it.  Okay?  Right.  So here's the DMX, you know, this song.  Who doesn't?  Gee, you hear this at every sporting event. 
[00:17:00]  There's your goddamn music.  Up in here, y'all going to make me go all out.  Up in here, up in here, y'all going to make me act a fool.  Up in here, up in here, y'all going to make me lose my fool.  Up in here, up in here.  The Mike Piazza's dancing.  All right.  There's no air there.  All right.  We know the song, right?  I think we're all familiar with it.  I don't know what he's singing there, Anthony. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  But your brother, Joe, he knew exactly what the lyrics were to that song.  Well, if James Taylor did it, you'd understand every word.  Here it is.  Same song.  Y'all going to make me lose my mind.  Up in here, up in here.  Y'all going to make me go all out.  Up in here, up in here.  Y'all going to make me act a fool.  Up in here, up in here.  Y'all going to make me lose my fool.  Up in here, up in here. 
[00:18:00]  If I've got to bring it to your cowards, then it's going to be quick.  All right.  All you men's up in the jail before.  Suck my d***.  And all them other cats you run with get done with dumb quick.  How the f*** you gonna cross the dog with some dumb s***?  All right.  There go the gun clip. 
[00:18:30]  Line one one s***.  All over some dumb s***.  Ain't that some s***?  Y'all n***s remind me of a strip club.  Cause every time you come around, it's like, what?  I just gotta get my d***s up.  And I don't know who the f*** you think you're talking to.  But I'm not him.  I ain't slim. 
[00:19:00]  So watch what you do while you go.  Find yourself buried next to someone else.  And we all thought you'd love yourself.  But that couldn't have been the issue.  Oh, maybe they just saying that.  Now, of course, they can miss you.  S***, a n*** tried to diss you.  That's why you're laying on your back.  Looking at the roof of the church. 
[00:19:30]  Preacher telling the truth.  And you know that it hurts.  Yeah.  Oh, y'all gon' make me lose my mind  Up in here, up in here  Y'all gon' make me go on out  Up in here, up in here  Y'all gon' make me act cool  Up in here, up in here  Y'all gon' make me lose my groove 
[00:20:00]  Up in here, up in here  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, up in here  There you have it, Brother Joe.  It's a great little crossover version.  That's classic.  Classic.  All right, we have to take a break.  This is the last day to qualify for our Moms I'd Like to F contest.  Ah, yes.  I'm looking at the website.  My God.  The competition's on, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  If you want to see our contestants that we have thus far, 
[00:20:30]  go to WNEW.com.  But ladies, moms, if you think you're hot and you got something  that you want to show us, come on down.  We'll get your pictures up with the other contestants.  The voting is going to start right after the show tomorrow.  So ladies, this is your last day to come down  to show us what you got.  We have a five-day, four-night trip to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina  to give away.  I want to thank Spirit Airlines for helping us out with that, okay?  I thought we took the Keith the Cop pictures off the...  Oh, that's the moms I want to...  Ah, what's it?  You know what's going on, guys? 
[00:21:00]  Hey, you're on the radio, Woodsy.  Let's go.  Yo, let the catfighting begin, baby.  And that's the other thing we're doing on the show today.  Yes, yes.  Catfighting, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  What's that?  What?  Hold on.  Dude, what's that?  What?  You guys look like Keith the Cop's picture.  Huh?  What happened?  I thought we were doing much better.  Hold on.  You don't like that mom, Anthony?  That's not a dad?  Can I...  I got to point something out to you. 
[00:21:30]  No, dude, you don't have to point out a thing.  Oh, that?  No, no, no.  Yeah, what's going on down there?  I don't know.  That is, my friends, a camel toe.  No, that's...  That's worse.  That's a T-Rex toe.  Looks like she's...  A velociraptor toe.  Looks like she's smuggling a yo-yo.  Well, you know, we don't turn down any women that want to come in here and be in the contest.  Right.  And the final word is with the listeners, who will vote online for their favorite mom. 
[00:22:00]  I think I can guarantee that that lady's not going to win the contest.  Win?  It's coming right for us.  Yeah.  It's coming right for us.  All right, so moms, you've got to come down.  This is the last day to qualify.  And Anthony, today on the show, catfighting.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got catfighting.  I'm really psyched for this.  We saw some of the videotapes.  It looks intense.  We have the ring out there.  All padded.

Her girls are probably about ten minutes away from getting here.  And we've got a bunch of amateurs showing up, too.  Yeah, we have one guy that's bringing down seven teenage girls.  Seven chicks.  Well, we're going to have teenage catfighting as well, so...  Well, why not?  We might as well start the festivities next, or at least, you know, start talking to the  ladies and see what they're all about, all right?  Sure.  Hello, Columbus.  Thanks for joining us today.

[00:25:00]  You have, like, mental problems.  What?  I don't know.  We got the CD in.  Drowning full.  And Opie puts this song on.  And you start heaving stuff around the office like a child.  And you have no regard for people's safety or people's personal possessions.  What do you want me to do?  Slow dance or something?  No.  Can't you just, like, enjoy it?  Listen, you're picking up heavy objects. 
[00:25:30]  You threw a box or kicked a garbage can right into a stack of the DAT tapes and the CD machine.  Rick got pissed and throws something back at Opie.  It's like a freaking play school in there.  You know what?  I love getting on Rick, but I think Rick was enjoying it.  Especially when I was knocking it out.  You know, the furniture over and stuff.  Ben was pissed off at me.  Ben was pissed.  Ben was very pissed.  You forget we work in an office.  Somebody's back there dealing with these other cities.  They're like, the F is going on in the background. 
[00:26:00]  Opie proceeds to then try and throw that metal thing at me.  We're just trying to get psyched for the show.  Someone welded this big stainless steel paperweight.  I think it's iron, dude.  That's heavy.  It's stainless steel.  Yeah.  It's very heavy.  It's got to weigh, what, 25 pounds?  Seriously?  At least.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Opie picks it up and just threatens to throw it at people.  The guy, I don't know where this comes from.  Like, I'm really going to throw that at somebody.  Oh, shut up.  Look at everybody.  You're the boomerang.  Yesterday he threw a quarter or something right at me. 
[00:26:30]  He'll throw something as hard as he can.  And then when it hits somebody, he goes, oh, sorry.  Oh, sorry.  What?  Oh, he threw it back at me.  He threw a boomerang once.  It's a frigging boomerang.  You can't tell where those are going to go.  And it hits Ben in the knee.  Let's slow down.  First of all, Bennett.  He threw his stool and broke it one day.  I hit you with a dime yesterday.  Oh, what's the difference?  A cart didn't fire.  He throws it at the huge wall of CDs.  He got taken out five CDs.  You hit me with a cart like a year ago.  You threw a cart across the room and nailed me over there. 
[00:27:00]  You got, like, some kind of problem.  Like, I don't think you're weighing out the consequences of your actions until after you're done.  I was just getting psyched for the show today.  A great way to get psyched.  Destroying Rick's equipment and the bands on the phone.  Did you see the garbage can explode when I kicked the garbage can?  It was a full garbage can.  It was funny.  Oh, my kid.  I was laughing because it wasn't me.  It's funny because it's not me.  The funny thing about it is Fox is in here, Fox News.  Yeah.  And they wanted to roll some B-roll, they call it. 
[00:27:30]  You know, the goofy stuff where they have you and I walking down the hall toward the studio.  And they're like, hey, we want to roll some B-roll in your office.  No!  No.  No!  You would have got a great shot today.  That's hard.  First of all, you'd need to see the reporter.  And here is how they prepare for their syndicator radio show.  Is that what you sound like?  And there's me just losing my effing mind to Drowning Pool, destroying the office.  You ever hear of an air guitar, dude?  Yeah, play air guitar or something. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  That's to go crazy.  That's like passe, the air guitar.  You've got to, like, throw stuff.  Whatever, Ben.  Shut up.  Shut up.  First of all, we couldn't allow the cameras in there because the pixelation crew would have their hands full.  I don't think there's one wall you could videotape that wouldn't have to be edited in some way, shape, or form.  We have our, in here, there's what they used to call the largest rock and roll library.  It's a bunch of CDs, a bunch of bands.  We have the largest porn library in our office. 
[00:28:30]  It's just, we get sent pornography all the time.  Tapes, pictures, DVDs, and an entire wall is dedicated to porno.  Most of them empty boxes because people at night pilfer them, put the empty box back,  and you don't know until, like, a week later when you try to pilfer it that it's gone.  But there's still plenty of porno.  We could show you some if you want, Fox.  We've got Century Sex.  It's a 100-year-old woman getting some for the last time, I think.  My personal favorite. 
[00:29:00]  Looks like E.T.  My favorite is Granny Gangbang.  Granny Gangbang.  Awful.  All right, let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on, man?  Yeah, I was wondering when you get into some real places like D.C. and L.A.  instead of, like, Columbus, which is, like, 30th in the nation.  Columbus is a cool market.  Cleveland's a cool market.  Philly isn't a big market.  Hey, Cleveland's a mistake, by the way.  We all know that.  Aw.  Come on, be honest.  Aw.  I've never been to Cleveland.  I'm not going to lie.  Actually, I went to a Bills game.  That's not true.  About 10 years ago. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, and when are you going to get to D.C.?  I don't know.  Working on that.  Yeah, I called the Ron and Fez show, like, last year and asked you when that.  Don't you worry, Mike.  You just listen to the show and enjoy it.  Oh, I have been.  It's your first year.  We're on some fine markets right now.  Get some better ones, okay?  How could you argue with the big wazoo in Columbus?  Right.  Well, the big wazoo, I can't argue with that.  I'll admit it, but...  You can't, see?  Go to their website.  They got pictures of some hot interns.  Mike and Keith's mom, though.  Keith's mom?  Yeah.  From yesterday? 
[00:30:00]  Why not?  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Imagine the carnage if our office was 60 feet underwater.  Hopefully we'd just be out of control.  He loves the submerged fighting.  We're going to replay that tomorrow when we take the day off.  Right.  The fight I had at 60 feet under the water.  Earl was at a sticker stop, and he's calling to tell us he's leaving.  Was?  He's 45 minutes.  Is he really leaving?  Yes.  Stop.  Do we have to explain Earl to more markets now?  Oh, it's self-explanatory when you put him on the air, and he just brings the whole energy 
[00:30:30]  level down to zero.  Now, you're going to think, if you're listening to this in another city, that, you know, why  should I listen to, you know, a couple guys talk to a guy that's doing a wow sticker stop  somewhere in Jersey?  Trust me, it's worth listening to.  It's worth listening to.  He's at, what, Progressive Brick?  I believe.  190 Route 17 North in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey.  But don't go there, because Earl's calling to tell us he's leaving.  Here it is.  Entertainment kryptonite.  Earl.  It's our buddy, our pal, Black Earl. 
[00:31:00]  Earl.  Earl.  Hello, guys.  Hey.  You're leaving?  Hello, Columbus.  Earl.  Yeah.  You're leaving?  Can you wake me when this call's over?  Oh, because I usually just have this narcoleptic fit when he's on the phone.  Ah, lady, good night.  The shortest call ever.  See, Earl does the sticker stops.  He takes the show's van.  We have, like, our own Scooby-Doo van.  And goes to various locations to hand out wow stickers.  Whip them out Wednesday stickers. 
[00:31:30]  We'll explain later.  And he goes there.  He calls up to tell us where he is.  We goof on him.  He quits.  It's the same gag every...  It's like his catchphrase is him just, I quit and leaving.  But he's serious right up until he gets back here.  And then he comes back into the fold.  Then he realizes he doesn't really have a life without this place.  So where the hell would he go?  So then he doesn't quit it.  But he hung up.  Now, we don't know if he's leaving or not. 
[00:32:00]  Earl, you have to give the information.  All these other fine radio stations, you know, when they do the call-ins with the guy on the street, it's nice.  It's very professional.  Right.  They call up.  Hi, guys.  I'm here at whatever, located wherever.  And I'm going to be here until...  All the information.  Earl's like, hello?  Um, I'm here.  And...  So he calls to say he's leaving.  So there's no reason for his call to begin with.  I was at a sticker stop. 
[00:32:30]  Great.  Great.  It's really helping everyone out, Earl.  Speaking of wow sticker stops, now Philly doing the first one today.  Oh, I wonder how that's going.  We got to check in with Melissa down there and see.  Because it should be interesting.  All right.  Let's go to Aaron.  Aaron, what's up?  Yeah, there was a cat fight at my work yesterday between these two girls.  And they were pretty rough.  They started at break time.  And they were...  I don't know what it was about, but they were slamming each other against walls.  And there was blood on the floor. 
[00:33:00]  A real fight?  Yeah.  It was...  One chick was black and the other chick was Puerto Rican.  Right.  And so it was real...  Yeah, it was pretty gruesome.  One girl's slam, the other girl's head into the wall.  And then they hit the window.  And then I think it was cracked.  Aaron, Aaron, can I cut in?  Yeah.  I hate to cut you off, but Earl is on the phone.  And, of course, we need the excitement of Earl on this program.  All right?  All right.  Stay tuned for our own cat fighting. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, that's coming up very soon.  We're waiting for some of the ladies to arrive.  They should be here very, very shortly.  Earl, thank God you're back on the phone.  Earl, what happened?  We had a minor problem.  So, Earl?  Yeah.  You're on in six cities.  What a dick.  I'm quitting.  What a dick.  What's wrong with this guy?  And management allows us day after day. 
[00:34:00]  Equal opportunity employment.  Well, sure.  We would be down a shwoogie if Earl laughed at him.  Oh, my goodness.  Jesus.  Inappropriate, Bill.  I'd do that for the reporter.  Inappropriate.  Look at her over there.  We love Earl, but he's not doing anything to bust apart any stereotypes.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, let's make believe he's here because he's not black.  Okay.  No one knows what Earl does in this building. 
[00:34:30]  Earl comes in every day for work.  Rick's laughing.  We've asked him, what do you do, Earl?  He goes, I do the public file.  What is the public file?  I don't even know what that is.  Do you know what the public file is?  No.  And how long could it possibly take?  A year.  And then he goes to sticker stops 45 minutes later.  I gotta go.  Can we get him on the line one more time?  Possibly?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[00:35:00]  Here he is.  All right, here he is.  All right.  I'll try to be nicer.  Okay.  Earl.  Yeah.  What's the problem today?  Is there a phone problem?  No.  Oh, you just keep hanging up when you hear something you don't like?  Possibly.  Okay.  Earl, are you still at the sticker stop?  We're at 190 Route 17 North in Hasbrook Heights, Progressive Brick, handing out wow stickers.  And we got some t-shirts here as well.  And that's pretty much the deal.  And when are you leaving? 
[00:35:30]  We have to leave shortly because we have to get maintenance done on the van.  Oh, Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  Yeah.  So you're calling us to tell us you're leaving in 10 minutes.  Well, you had me on hold for 45 minutes.  What if someone is 15 minutes away from the sticker stop?  Well, I told Stinky off air that we had to leave at 4 o'clock.  They're out of luck if they're 15 minutes away. 
[00:36:00]  They don't get their wow sticker today.  And I told them, I said, to let the guys know that we're going to leave stickers inside a Progressive Brick.  When you pull in, go inside, check the store out, pick up the sticker.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love.  All right.  So what's wrong with the van that you've got to have maintenance done on it?  You name it.  You're right.  We've got to get the air conditioning redone.  We've got to get the new wiper blades put on.  We've got to get the oil.  The wiper blades. 
[00:36:30]  The guts are shot.  Charcoal briquette.  Hey.  Couldn't we get the...  Oh, Tony Soprano, stop.  Couldn't we get these repairs done, I don't know.  Well, we've got a long holiday weekend.  This is the only time we could slide it in.  A Moulignan.  Jesus Christ.  Earl, our fine website says that you're showing up at this sticker stop at 4.  Not leaving at 4.  Well, we were told by our illustrious sales department to come an hour early.  Oh, that's good.  Well, we've been advertising that you'll be there at 4.  That's what I said. 
[00:37:00]  And when we're not on the air to promote the fact that you're going to be down there for an hour before we...  Well, like I said, you had me on hold.  I called in at 3 o'clock.  You had me on hold for 45 minutes.  Well, we had to get to the comedy, Earl.  Well, I know that.  I'm Big Dick Black.  All right.  Earl, you know we're a syndicated show now.  Yes.  You guys are the hot stuff now.  I was going to say another word and I caught myself.  Nigga, please.  No, stop it.  We're cakes for nothing.  All right, Earl. 
[00:37:30]  Thanks, I guess.  Thanks for the effort today.  You know, we've got some balls.  Now we get us crapped on.  Now we're having fun.  Earl, what did I say?  I said, thanks for the effort.  Why are you reading into that?  I said, thank you.  Thanks for helping out the show.  Thanks for the effort.  Well, you do have a sick, psychotic sense of humor.  So I didn't know how to read that.  What a stupid voice.  Could you shut up?  I really appreciate that you put in 50 minutes today for our show. 
[00:38:00]  So we try.  Oh, God.  So we try, guys.  We really, really try.  It's mighty white of you.  Help us out today.  No, don't stop it.  Well, remember, Earl.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, kites, wops, or greasers.  See, that was insane because I love that movie.  Thank you, Gunnery's Sergeant Hartman.  All right, see?  Earl's laughing now.  All right, Earl.  All righty, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:38:30]  Another fine job.  I am not going to play the coon for six markets.  Transversion.  Boring.  Too late.  I refuse to do that.  Refuse to do what, Earl?  I refuse to be the coon.  No, you're the HNIC.  I'm not that either.  All right, Earl.  We're boring people.  Well, I apologize to the other markets. 
[00:39:00]  What?  And it's okay for New York and Philadelphia because they've been with us a little while?  No, they're used to it.  They're used to you already?  Yeah.  Can you imagine someone in Columbus, Ohio listening to you for the first time?  Must be a treat.  Earl, who's taking care of the public file right now?  Well, I am.  That's one of the things I've got to do when I'm rent.  The quarter's almost over.  What?  What is it?  What is it?  Well, you really want to know what it is?  Yeah.  Without boring people, it lists all of the charities, all of the public service announcements, 
[00:39:30]  everything that allegedly helps the community.  So when you guys go on the air and someone complains about it, they look in the public file and they say,  hey, they're doing...  What do you do with it?  Translation boring.  What, Earl?  I'm sorry?  Yes, you do.  Why do you have to put it together?  I'm the public service director.  Shut up, dummy. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, look at that, Earl.  People are peeping at them.  A fan of yours.  All right, you better go because you've got to get the van in for some work, right?  Yeah, you want it this Saturday for the road show, don't you?  We don't need the van at our road show Saturday.  Right?  Earl?  Who's driving all the drunk people home?  Hey, Earl, we've got to go.  Okay.  All right.  There he is.  Thank you, Earl.  Earl, thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  We look forward to your next phone call.  With great anticipation.  That's right.  All right.  Can we get the catfighting lady in here next?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's get to the catfighting.  I want to hear about this.  All right.  Any other ladies show up for that?  A couple of them are like two blocks away.  Two blocks away?  Yep.  Okay.  877-692-1027.  Catfighting next.  Opie.  Wow.  That's the road show.  Opie and Anthony hit the Jersey Shore this Saturday for an all-day road show at the Stone 
[00:41:00]  Pony in Asbury Park featuring special guests, the nerds, and the Ultimate Wet T-Shirt  Contest.  First prize winner gets a thousand bucks.  The party starts at 1 p.m.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Yeah.  The Planet Java sampling trucks.  They've been crisscrossing the Tristad area for months now.  This Thursday, July 5th, they're making a big-time appearance in New Jersey at the  Keensburg Water and Amusement Park.  Exit 117 off the Garden State Parkway.  Stop by for a wet and wild time and sample the coolest drink to hit the streets yet.  It's Planet Java. 
[00:41:30]  Great tasting Planet Java.  How to kick the competition's ass.  And the Planet Java sampling trucks have cool new flavors.  They got Javadelic, Trimble, and Karamoca.  Javadelic, it's a grown-up milkshake.  It's real smooth.  A mix of a low-fat milk and coffee.  And Karamoca's chocolate caramel and coffee tastes really good.  And Trimble, bam, in a bottle.  It's 121 milligrams of caffeine.  Highest caffeinated drink in the country.  You get the idea.  Trimble does the trick deliciously.  The wildest thing in town.  Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold. 
[00:42:00]  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet demand, they get it.  So you get some Planet Java tool.  Iced coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  Planet Java.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027. 
[00:42:30]  Jim Norton has arrived.  What's up, Jimmy?  Say hi to the Fox crew from Fox News.  Hi, they're filming me.  Nice.  They're annoying as hell.  Nice.  You're not being very nice, Opie.  He should have been bludgeoned.  Best line ever, man.  Have him.  Someone's suggesting we should just give Earl enough gas to get to the sticker stop. 
[00:43:00]  That's a great idea.  And then afterwards, when we want him to leave, he send a little gas can.  Yeah.  He can fill the van up and make his way back.  And then he can't leave.  Well, we should get the lady in.  Melee.  Melee.  You know, let's talk to her.  We're doing catfighting today.  She called us up last week.  Said she has girls that cat fight.  They rip each other's clothes off and just get into big brawls.  We're ready to rumble a lot.  Wow.  What kind of drugs are you on? 
[00:43:30]  Nothing.  Really?  It's me.  She gives really good hugs, Anthony.  Very nice hugs.  How are you?  Oh, that's okay.  I prefer...  I'm like a germaphobe, I guess.  I prefer not to be...  Well, that's my excuse for not being touched.  I just don't like being touched.  You don't like me?  No, no.  I'm a very cold person.  I'll touch you with my eyes.  No.  Well, see, that's why I thought you were on drugs.  You guys, your eyes are like...  Whoa.  No, I'm on the...  I like being touched.  Pupil dilation. 
[00:44:00]  Pupil dilation.  Pupil dilation.  What does it do to you?  Okay, terrific.  Melee.  Melee.  So, we're ready for some action.  You have girls...  I was anticipating all this all day.  You have girls that fight.  Yes, we got girls that fight.  You got a little magazine there?  I got some magazines.  All right, let me take a look.  I'm on the cover.  Oh, that's you on the cover.  Can I have a magazine?  You will have a magazine.  Oh, my God.  I bought some videos.  I have some CDs, and I have some gifts for the girls. 
[00:44:30]  Cat Spats, special issue.  Cocky Cat Fighters.  Woo!  How about that?  Go get them.  So, you're in charge of the catfighting in New York City?  Well, not per se.  I mean, I work for a company.  They're Crystal Films.  And if you want more information, you can find them at catfight1.com.  You can get some information there.  We are putting on a show, like I had mentioned to you guys, at the Day of Iniquity, July 28th, at 7 o'clock.  If you want more information there, you can call at 229-2149. 
[00:45:00]  There you go.  L. Scott Sales, also here in the city on 39th Street, has some information.  Could you take it down a notch?  Take it down a notch.  Who's the chick with the braces?  Oh, my God.  She got her teeth straightened out before they took them off.  Oh, really?  Now, melee.  Yes.  What are the rules of catfighting?  We thought the rules were really simple.  The girl that gets her clothes ripped off first loses. 
[00:45:30]  Not necessarily.  The way we've been doing them for the last maybe seven years is by points.  We have judges.  Ah, the point system.  And originally, this whole thing was to invite you guys to come down and be judges because we needed people to be judges.  We're so busy that day.  What day is that?  July 28th, at 7 o'clock.  Yeah, as I was saying, we're so busy that day.  Well, we need people, you know, that can move.  All right, listen. 
[00:46:00]  We're just so busy.  Is there any hardcore sex in these videos, or is it just chicks punching each other?  No, pretty much girls going at each other.  I saw the video back in the office.  You would like it.  A lot of hair pulling.  We saw the opening.  It was a lot of lead-up.  The only two things that we do not allow is fist punching in the face and eye gouging.  That's best left at home anyway.  Yes, absolutely.  So we're going to play Opie and Anthony rules today.  We're going to get the girls in some nice outfits.  Okay. 
[00:46:30]  And the girl that gets her clothes ripped off first loses.  We're talking complete nudity after a while?  Well, if the girls want to go completely nudity.  Wait, wait.  I'm talking today.  Do they want to?  If they want to, that's it.  If they want to.  If they want to go topless, fine.  If they want not to be bottomless, then you're going to have to attend the show to see the bottom.  Uh-oh.  Oh, all right, well, we'll see what happens.  We've got a lot of girls coming down for this, Ant.  Don't worry.  So, I mean, it's, you know, up for grabs.  I know our listeners will.  Up for grabs.  By who?  Oh, up for grabs.  I know our listeners won't let us down. 
[00:47:00]  Okay.  Your girls might let us down.  That's intense.  We've got some wild girls associated with the show.  We've got teenagers that are going to do teen catfighting today.  Okay.  How old are they?  Like 13, 14.  Nice.  I'm young.  I want to see.  Look at the face.  No, not 13, 14.  They're 18.  18, legal, still considered teens.  You know, the barely legal variety.  Okay, well, that's acceptable.  All right.  I want them to get, like, their necks and leg locks and leave hickeys.  That's what I want. 
[00:47:30]  I got bitten once, and the girl beat me so hard.  I was ready to seriously punch her in her face.  And what happened?  Why didn't you?  The bell rang, and she got saved by the bell.  There you go.  But it was an intense fight.  I mean, I think it was the most intense fight I had ever done.  Saved by the bell, though.  Well, if you're pissed off, you've got to keep, you know, punching after the bell.  After the bell.  See, we do five minutes of the actual fighting, and we take a break, give the girls, you know,  a chance to breathe, and get their act together.  Right.  Then we do it three more times. 
[00:48:00]  By the end of the third round, I mean, you're out of air.  You know what I mean?  Your adrenaline is going.  You're stabbing.  That's how Norton likes him.  Totally out of air.  Just about choked out.  Are we allowed to jump in and throw a punch or two if you want?  No, sir.  No punching.  No punching and no eye gouging.  Aren't you listening to it?  How about an open-handed slap, maybe, or a good nipple grab?  The audience is not allowed to participate.  Hey, can I jump in?  Because I used to punch Robin Givens right in the face, and it was wonderful. 
[00:48:30]  That was the best punch I ever threw on my whole effing wife.  And I punched Robin Givens.  She flew across the room and hit the wall.  It was wonderful.  More power to him.  And then I bit her ear off.  No guy on girl stuff.  You've never done that.  Well, the girls that I'm bringing down, they do fight guys.  Oh, they do?  Yes.  So if you want to talk to them when they show up, you can make an arrangement or an appointment  with them, and there'll be more than one.  All right.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:49:00]  Hey.  Hey, Melee.  Hi, Melee.  What's up?  Nothing.  How are you?  Why didn't you tell us you were going to be on?  Excuse me?  Wait, Michael, you know Melee?  Yes, we do.  How about bringing everyone else up to speed?  Somewhere.  All right.  How do you know Melee?  My wife was wrestling with her in Brooklyn.  Oh, yeah?  Melee, why are you handing me pictures of you naked?  Because that's a layout that I did for this particular magazine, and we do talk about the  cat fight and all that. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, look at that.  You've got a couple of great ones down there.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  When did those start coming in, Melee?  We're not going to go there.  Wow, look at that.  Well, look at that, man.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  Let me see, Opie.  I haven't seen this pictorial yet.  No, he hasn't.  Well, you have a choice.  You can take that one or the other one.  Whoa!  Boy, you're not shy.  No, not at all.  Look at that.  I can see what you had for lunch before this shot.  Ooh.  How old are you, Opie?  No, she ain't shy.  We're not going to go there, either.  You're not?  How old do I look? 
[00:50:00]  I'll just look at this picture.  That's a load of cash.  Count the ring, right?  Okay.  Hey, Michael, so your wife fought Melee?  Just about, in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  In Brooklyn.  When they were in the loft.  Oh.  And your wife kicked Melee's ass?  No.  No.  Not quite.  Not quite.  No?  Not at all.  She ran out of air.  Okay.  All right, Michael.  Thank you.  All right.  Melee, take care.  Thanks.  Bye, Mike.  Thanks for adding nothing to our show.  This hair is great down here, Melee.  It looks like you got a Paulie Walnuts from The Sopranos' head and a leg lock. 
[00:50:30]  Doesn't it?  Go get them.  Have you seen Paulie Walnuts?  I have had some pulls during a head fight.  It kind of looks like that.  Believe me, if Pepe Le Pew saw that, he'd try to kiss it.  You know how he gets?  You know when the black cat gets the paint on her back and he's like, yes, I'm all to  me.  I love you.  He'd be chasing this all over town.  All right.  Because it kind of looks like that.  You got a few stragglers.  Hey, could you tweak the you-know-whats when you're catfighting? 
[00:51:00]  People want to know.  You can if you want.  A purple nurple open.  And you can scratch?  You can scratch.  All right.  What else can you do?  Well, you can do this kind of punching.  You know what I mean?  Like an open, but not in the face.  In the body, on the chest, in the behind, on the legs.  Okay.  You know what that looks like?  Now I got it.  Opie, if you threw a London broil in the dryer, went through a cycle, and then cleaned  out the lint filter.  Woo!  That's a perfect...  That's perfect what that looks like.  Hey, that's hot.  That's hot.  Where do I get some? 
[00:51:30]  Well, London broil you normally eat.  Is that good enough to eat?  I'm kind of disturbed, but...  Okay, terrific.  Could I...  Excuse me.  Tasmanian devil, how long have you been...  How long have you been wrestling and fighting for?  I've been wrestling for the last 10 years.  I have gone up against bigger girls, like 5'11", 5'10", shorter girls, heavier girls.  Hotter girls?  Hotter girls.  Definitely hotter girls.  As a matter of fact, talking about hot girls, this next cat fight, I had done a cat fight 
[00:52:00]  before...  Melee.  This shot, oh my God.  It's just not attractive.  Aww.  And then with the gray, and you're really showing a lot.  Let me say, because now you're using your hands to show...  It looks like a snow leopard fell into a chainsaw.  If I could, yet again, try to convey to the audience what we're looking at there.  Melee, there's something like that.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's good to leave some to the imagination. 
[00:52:30]  Imagination, good.  That was Warren Tong.  He takes pictures for Penthouse and Playboy.  Oh, he does?  Hmm.  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  There you go.  Wow.  I have all you need to say.  I figured out what she likes to do in bed.  Sure.  In any case.  Okay.  Do we have some of the ladies here yet that we can talk to?  We're going to be doing this outside the studio.  We're going to be taking a lot of pictures and video. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  And you'll be able to check out the pictures and the video on a few websites.  We'll give out those websites in a little bit, right?  Okay.  Who's here so far for the cat fighting?  I had spoken to the girls a half an hour ago, and they said they were on their way.  They're on their way?  Okay.  Okay.  If there's anybody interested in joining us, in participating, I have a phone number if  they're interested in being a wrestler.  Okay.  Just like taking people off the street and letting them go to town.  To participate. 
[00:53:30]  You know, we want to give everybody a chance if they can do it.  What we find is that some of the girls that smoke have a hard time wrestling because they  can't breathe and they turn into asthma.  Really?  I'm like, now that I'd pay to say some woman trying to go for her inhaler and another one  just claws her eyes out.  She gets punched right in the ventricle.  That's great.  We had a serious accident this couple of months ago where the girl landed up in the hospital.  Uh-oh, really?  Yeah.  Could get dangerous. 
[00:54:00]  Because we have an EMT person there.  We have a doctor.  We have insurance.  Michael.  That's good.  Yeah.  Does this girl ever get to the point?  She sounds like Dr. Howell on Gilgans Island, for Christ's sakes.  Mr. Howell.  Mr. Howell.  Whatever.  Or the professor.  She's like one long sentence.  Why don't you just keep fighting?  Just fight already, will you?  You want me to fight?  With that voice that's driving me up the wall.  All right.  Oh, sorry to hear that.  Malay's an interesting woman.  She's in the Over 40 magazine.  I just saw the cover there.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Over 40.  It is. 
[00:54:30]  She looks good naked.  All right.  Just start fighting, please.  You like that, Norton?  Yes, very much.  Nice, right?  Wait for some of the ladies to show up.  So far, we only have Malay.  Well, they're on their way.  You sure they're on their way?  Yeah, yeah.  You wouldn't let us down, right?  No, absolutely not.  Okay.  Malay can't fight with herself, can you?  Not really.  Tyler Durden type of thing?  Let me go to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Matt.  What's going on?  I got a question for you, real quick.  For the girl?  Yeah.  Can they get punched in the crotch?  What about, well, no punching, but is there a grabbing or smacking? 
[00:55:00]  Yes, yes.  Yes, you can smack.  I've gotten my hairs pulled a couple of times.  Oh.  It's not very pleasant, but it hurts.  It's real.  I got a date night with Jim Norton, right?  You could pull the hair, though.  Yes.  Okay, good.  All right, check it out.  What if you're on the rag, though, and you're using, like, a really thick one?  Is that, like, illegal?  What about that?  What about a pad?  Something thick.  Illegal?  Is that like padding?  Is that like cushioning that might help?  Eating.  It's like a mouth guard in boxing. 
[00:55:30]  I think the girl is all about it.  So you don't bite your tongue or anything else happens there.  I mean, they might use a tampon, but I don't know about a pad.  Okay.  It's not a sight.  All right, we're talking to Melee.  We're talking about cat fighting.  Did you ever get that thing so bludgeoned that you had to yell, cut me, Mickey, cut me?  Did it look like a punched eye?  It could look like a punched eye.  Oh, my God.  Hey, look at that thing.  It looks like a cut over the eye or something.  We haven't had that one yet, but anything is possible.  That's great. 
[00:56:00]  Fat lip.  I like your fat lip.  You give her a fat lip.  Yes.  Hey, if you do have a tamp, can you take it out and swing it like a medieval mace?  Well, if there's no rules, anything can happen.  Okay, I like it.  All right, our phone number, toll-free, 877-692-1027.  Let's talk to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, ONA, how are you guys doing?  We're doing pretty well.  Hey, you know, from your reaction, guys, it kind of sounds like she got caught up in a 
[00:56:30]  melee, you know?  Well, they call her, is that, you're kind of, that's a play on words, your name.  Melee being a melee.  Right.  Well, I got it.  Absolutely.  She's just showing a little too much in her pictorial, that's all.  I like them.  Dude, it's over 40, so what do you expect?  You've got to have that over 40.  A couple of gray ones never heard anything, right?  No.  Sure, it looks like dental floss.  Yeah.  Well, some people go gray premature.  Can you, um, was that premature?  It looks like Catherine Hepburn scowling. 
[00:57:00]  Look into my eye.  All right.  What else do you want to know?  I'm psyched to see this.  Well, it's real.  That's all I have to say.  We really don't want to talk anymore.  We'd rather see it.  You want to see it.  Yeah.  And then we'll give a big plug for the catfighting that's going to happen in New York, okay?  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Rick?  We need judges, we need girls, we need an audience.  Did I come to the right place?  Yes, you did.  I think we can help you out there.  Sure.  I bought this for Keith.  This is the proper thong, I believe. 
[00:57:30]  Is that a used thong you're holding on?  No, it's brand new.  That is not brand new.  It's stiff.  It looks faded, and it looks a little stiff.  It looks like it might have been used.  It was not used.  It's brand new.  All right.  Nice to see.  It's leather?  Yes, it's leather.  That's great.  The cow gave his life for, it's going to be right there.  All right, shall we take a break and hope the ladies show up?  Yeah, I got to ask Melee.  She said the girls would be here between 3 and 4.  I called a half an hour ago.  They said they were on their way.  Whoever answered the phone, they said they already left.  All right, we'll check in. 
[00:58:00]  Ah!  Ah, she threw the panties at Opie.  No, it's a bug.  All right, toll free, 877-692-1027.  Quick break.  We'll be back with Melee and some of the ladies that will be catfighting today.  I'll give you the option of apologizing or I'll tell you what I'm going to do with your telephone number.  I'm going to go to the city paper and I'm going to take out an ad that says,  I like it in the bung. 
[00:58:30]  All right, I'll apologize.  Create a nice apology.  I am absolutely 100% apologetic that I ruined and degraded your wonderful, professional radio show.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Not accepted.  The Don and Mike Show, weeknights on 1027.  WNEW.  Opie Anthony.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:59:00]  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Hopefully we'll have some catfighting in the very near future on the show, Ant.  Well, Melee is here.  She's in charge of some of this stuff.  We should say hi to Colin Quinn in the studio.  Hi, fellas.  Jim Norton in the studio.  It's turning into a party.  Were you thumbing through Over 40 magazine?  I was.  I like Over 40. 
[00:59:30]  Do you?  Well, it's either this or, I don't know, a female comedian, Paula.  She likes Under 12.  Paula Poundstone.  Probably already made that joke four times today.  That's a good joke.  Paula Poundstone joke's always funny right now.  Yeah, let's get Melee back in here.  Yeah, wait till you see this, Colin.  This is disturbing.  Show Colin her pictures from the magazine.  I just opened it.  Oh, you did.  You just opened it.  I was offended.  Yes.  You.  That's just the beginning of it.  This gets really bad.  Melee is back. 
[01:00:00]  And we're still waiting for your catfighters, Melee.  I just told you that they left a half an hour ago, 45 minutes.  I can't imagine what's going on.  You're not lying to us, are you?  I am not lying.  You know what we do to liars around here.  If no girls show up, we're going to have to just kick your ass.  Kick my ass?  We're going to just beat you up.  You and what army?  Well, I'll tell you right now.  Colin Quinn.  Rick is so nervous because he produces the show.  He says if your ladies don't show up, he's going to wrestle you.  He's going to punch you in the vulva.  I'm just going to throw you out a freaking window if you think I'm going to show up. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I'd like to see that happen.  No way.  We've been pushing this show for the last week.  Fight club.  Fight club.  Fight club.  You think you can take Rick, Maylee?  I can take Rick.  You think you can take Rick?  I'm not talking like the cutesy wrestling.  No.  Rick will punch you in the face like really hard.  No, he'll do.  Yeah.  I took boxing lessons.  Did you?  Yes.  He'll do catfighting rules.  You'll do catfighting rules.  Right, Rick?  You'll put the thong on.  Do some Tito Ortiz tour, man.  Yeah.  Forearm smash.  I'll Tito her ass.  I'll Tito her ass.  You know, looking at this open picture, did you ever play softball without a mitt? 
[01:01:00]  God damn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll have to think about it.  Yeah.  One of my wildest fantasies.  Thwock.  I thought of something during the commercial break.  I thought of something during the commercial break.  It's a talent Opie has that is amazing.  He's 100% on this.  He could tell people's age.  You know, Ann, I don't think I want to...  No, no, no, no, no. 
[01:01:30]  Don't even back down on this.  He could tell people's age from the taint.  You know what the taint is?  I don't think I want to show off my skills today, Ann.  Melee.  Fox News is here.  No, because I got to see this.  This is amazing.  We've done this before.  He never fails.  You know what the taint is, Melee?  Where?  It taint the front of you and it taint the back of you.  It's taint, you know what I mean?  Right in the middle, in between.  It's right there in the magazine.  It's the part most covered with the gray hairs. 
[01:02:00]  The taint.  The taint.  Right where the stripe is.  And I know, because this is a great test.  Would you show Opie your taint and he can guess your age?  It's a miracle.  You will be amazed.  It's like watching Kreskin work.  I'm a little tired today.  I don't really want to show off my skills.  You're not backing out of this one.  Would you just...  And if you want privacy, just show Opie.  But he will guess your age from just looking at your taint.  I am really good at this.  Show me.  Opie, please.  Humor me a minute. 
[01:02:30]  Would you just go over there and show Opie your taint?  We do have a lot of new cities listening to the show, too.  You'll be amazed.  Would you please just show Opie your taint?  Can I take a ring check?  Um, no.  Could you just...  It's easy.  You go over to that side of the console.  I'll do it first.  You're wearing a dress.  Colin, show Opie your taint.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is this going to be on the O'Reilly Factor?  I swear to God, we thought Norton was like 24 until he got drunk in the office.  I hope he, like, blurted it out when you had that episode. 
[01:03:00]  Easy.  No.  Melee, would you?  Yeah, we'll turn off the cameras.  I'll think about it.  We'll turn off any cameras.  I'll think about it.  There's no time to think.  It's live radio.  Yeah, we've got to do it now.  And we'll plug your catfighting for the rest of the show, without a doubt.  Melee, please.  Where is this going to take place?  You're right, like, in the corner, back behind the equipment, anywhere.  He could get a look, but he's got to get a look at the taint.  Quick look.  If you come over here, the cameras.  He wouldn't take your gun out.  Melee, if you come over here, you're just doing what you did in your photo shoot. 
[01:03:30]  I wouldn't even push it this hard if it wasn't so fantastic and amazing.  You'll be stunned.  Could you please just.  I will guess your age.  Take off the headphones.  Yeah.  Take off the headphones.  Walk over to that side and watch.  You'll be amazed.  I'll guess it within a year, without a doubt.  Within a year?  No.  I've never failed.  He's never failed to hit it on the mark.  Yeah, but if she just had a birthday.  Don't say anything.  You know what I mean?  Just.  Could you take your headphones off and walk over there?  You'll be stunned. 
[01:04:00]  He's not going to look at the other areas.  No.  He's right in the middle of the taint.  Just in the middle.  Right.  Melee.  Thank you, Colin.  If you don't want this film, you just tell the crew and they will not film it.  No filming.  They wouldn't show this.  They're not going to show this on Fox.  No filming.  Yeah, Fox News is going to show this.  Fox 5 coming up.  Taint.  Anthony.  We'll show you a 10.  Taint.  By the way, Anthony, payback is a bitch.  Yeah.  What's that?  Oh, no.  You got to go around that way.  No one's going to look.  Just go around that way.  Get a big sheet so she's completely blocked. 
[01:04:30]  Where are you going?  She's walking around the studio.  Hey, where?  She just disappeared behind her.  She's so wired for the idea of it all.  Get a big sheet to hold up.  Where is she?  Are you stuck back there?  She disappeared.  Oh, here she goes.  Now, go around that way.  Oh, that's okay.  I understand.  She's got to take off some stuff.  Come on.  Just go over there.  She's a bro.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  And I'm going to kill you.  Take.  No, because I'm stunned at this.  This is outrageous.  This is a great idea.  All right.  Show the taint.  Show the taint to open.  No, no, no.  You got to.  Scott, go around that way. 
[01:05:00]  Ride.  No, you can back up.  No, no.  She knows what a taint is here.  Lift up.  You're going to learn really quick.  No, wait.  I can't do this.  Opie, do it for crying out loud.  I'm not feeling my talent today.  No.  No, I'm really not feeling it.  Use the force loop.  No, no.  You're going to read it.  She's sexy.  Come on.  I am not feeling this today.  Stare into Medusa.  My psychic powers are on vacation.  Let her tell her.  She's sexy.  Opie, don't ruin it.  All right.  Back up a little, though.  She's sexy.  Take a look.  He's like Karnak. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  All right.  Now, watch this.  Now, you got to lift up.  Now, lift up.  Take a look at the taint, Opie.  No, lift up.  Just a little more.  There it is.  See?  You see it?  Taking a look.  Oh.  Did you get it?  Wait, no, no.  Did you get it?  No, I had him look away.  Don't look away.  What are you?  It looks like it looks like it looks like it looks like it looks like it looks like it looks like.  I stared into the face of Medusa.  All right.  Take a good look and guess the age.  I'm looking like an idiot because this is an amazing thing and you're not.  All right.  Take a good look. 
[01:06:00]  Staring into the abyss.  There he goes.  Get the abyss.  It looks like a documentary.  You have to show him a little more real estate with them.  There you go.  There she goes.  Opie.  Wow.  Look at that.  Now, watch this.  I'm stunned whenever he does this.  Opie, please.  Guess the age.  Will you shut up?  I'm working it out in my head right now.  All right.  Looks like a documentary on Sarajevo.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[01:06:30]  If you could just a little.  Yeah, right there.  All right.  Oh, very interesting.  He's taking a look.  Okay.  One, two, three.  Now, do you do some kind of math?  I don't know what it is.  Okay.  It's an aspicus.  Alchemy.  I'm almost there.  Alchemy.  I've turned it into gold.  I'm almost there.  Is there a turtle head poking out?  Okay.  I got it.  Yes.  All right.  I hate you.  I will get you back.  Buckle in.  You're going to love this.  Here, sit over there because if I'm wrong, I don't want you to punch me. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, because.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you come up wrong on this.  I must say.  I get stunned.  A bit deceiving.  Why?  I was going to go a little older.  Were you?  Yeah.  Now, judging by her taint alone, you will tell us her age.  Well, she just showed us over 40.  Yeah.  She should not be in that magazine, Anthony.  Whoa.  You're saying she's younger than 40?  No.  She's.  Oh, really?  She should be in over 50. 
[01:07:30]  Am I right so far?  How old?  Watch this.  She just had a birthday.  Uh-oh.  See that?  Okay.  Then I'm going to change my guess.  Why?  Because if she didn't have a birthday, then I would have...  I'm going to go 52 years old.  How old are you?  Holy Jesus.  Nice.  All right.  You know something?  He never gets it wrong.  You are amazing.  Wow.  Holy S.  You look like two miles of bad road. 
[01:08:00]  What gave it away?  Was it the Calvin Coolidge stamp on the thing?  What's the secret?  How is that?  It's amazing.  You know something?  It's just something that I discovered when I was very young.  You learned it from your father and his father before him.  Right.  It's been passed on for generations.  I believe they found out the age of the pharaoh using the same technique in the pyramids.  It is a gift.  It's a gift.  What would you call it?  52 years old, right?  Unless he's been with another woman.  It's a gift. 
[01:08:30]  Are those lips or war bonds?  Well, after having four children.  That's great.  Well, that's why I was going to go a little older.  Four children.  It's a little rough.  A little rough.  Brian, what's going on?  How do you figure it out?  By, like, lip drying or something?  I don't know.  Brian, we will never know.  I am probably closer to Opie than many people.  We've worked together for years.  He will not tell me how the hell he does this, but it's amazing 100% every time.  There's counting involved.  There is some kind of math involved. 
[01:09:00]  Counting, yeah.  Micromotors or something?  What do you look at?  You're stunned.  Well, it's kind of like counting rings almost.  Is it almost like rings of a tree?  Yeah, but each ring is a certain group of years.  Oh, okay.  Oh, how about that?  Isn't that something?  London Amaze.  Once again.  Colin, what do you think?  Isn't that amazing?  It really is quite a talent.  Yeah.  You do only women? 
[01:09:30]  He's got to market that somehow.  I'm going to practice on my cats, you know, so I get to know.  Boy, thanks, man.  I know how he does it.  It's amazing, Norton.  How do you know, Jim?  It's math.  It's math.  It's got something to do with the distance between one area and the other area,  and you subtract the nose clip and multiply by pi.  Where was my nose clip?  No, where was mine? 
[01:10:00]  Point missed.  Somebody dropped pennies in a dog's mouth.  How'd you like to suck my egg?  No, that's okay.  Hey, I'm Anthony.  Some cat fighters have arrived.  Really?  All right.  Is your hair turning gray now?  Shut up.  All of a sudden, he looks like Moses after he looked at the burning bush.  I have looked into the face of God Almighty.  He did turn red.  He's still red.  That's because I was holding my breath here. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, he just stared into Mount River Rat.  Al, what's up?  I know how you do it.  I do it myself.  You have to calibrate the thickness of the callus.  All right.  Now I'm getting completely disgusting.  Let's go to Logan.  Logan, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I just think I'm calling from Columbus. 
[01:11:00]  Welcome, Columbus.  Seen bus in the house.  What's up?  And I'm just letting you guys know this show kicks ass.  And, I mean, everything.  Catfighting.  Just everything, man.  All right.  Thanks, Logan.  No problem.  We've only got to get on the radio like an hour and a half.  But thank you.  No problem.  All right.  Bye.  Look, Columbus fans already calling in, Opie.  Why don't we get the catfighters in here?  Yeah, let's get some of these girls in here and they could share your mic.  Oh, Hot Melissa is doing the first WOW sticker stop for Philadelphia. 
[01:11:30]  Really?  For all the fine folks listening to us on WYSP today.  Yes, she's on the phone right now.  Let's see how it's going.  Melissa.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  How are you today?  I'm pretty good.  I actually just came from a Cuban bar and had some aphrodisiac drinks.  Yeah.  So I'm actually in a really good mood right now.  Oh, cool.  And all your listeners are really excited about that.  They're outside.  There's a bunch of them that showed up.  You guys should be proud.  Well, you guys finally got the WYSP WOW stickers in, right? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, definitely.  They look really cool.  Wait till you see them.  All right.  I'll bring some up with you.  They're really cool, though.  Yeah, we're looking forward to getting those stickers.  Hey, what's so funny?  Nothing.  You guys are up to something as usual.  No.  No, we're not.  Well, we have the WYSP van, and we had the show playing on Market Street, 21st and Market.  And I don't know, but a bunch of people came up and was like, what is that? 
[01:12:30]  Right.  So we had to tell them it was Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Well, thank you, Melissa.  All right.  I think we got a few new listeners there.  You sound kind of drunk today.  You sound tipsy.  I wasn't kidding about the mojitos that I had.  Uh-oh.  I'm on my way on vacation for two weeks, so I had a cocktail beforehand.  Oh.  Wow.  Well, Melissa.  All right, guys.  We'll check in with you when you get back, okay? 
[01:13:00]  All right.  I'm going to come in and stop by when I get back, all right?  All right.  Thank you, Melissa.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  The first ever Wow sticker stop in Philadelphia, Anthony.  I hope it's going well.  Basically, whip them out Wednesdays.  Tomorrow, we will not be here.  The show will be on, but we're going to take a day.  But basically, you put Wow in your car.  This is for all the new markets.  New York understands already.  Yes.  Make homemade Wow signs.  Put them on your car.  And if the ladies feel like it, they will flash their boobies to you as you drive your car.  What a great way to break up your commute home. 
[01:13:30]  You just put a Wow in the car.  You forget about it.  All of a sudden, you're driving.  You're stuck in traffic, maybe had a bad day.  You look to your left or something.  There's a girl just showing you her lovely body.  And you don't know what happened.  You go, what?  Why is she doing it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I put a Wow in my car.  And for the newer markets, it'll take a few weeks.  Yeah.  You know, because we've got to get some ladies to understand the concept of Wow.  But basically, to get started, get a homemade Wow and put it on your car and drive around  tomorrow and see what happens.  Okay?  Right.  And if your radio station really feels like it, they'll make some bumper stickers up, right? 
[01:14:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Let's go to Joey.  Joey, what's up?  Joey.  Hey, Rangel.  Hey.  You're a man of many talents, but I didn't know you could read lips.  Lip reading.  Of course.  Thank you, Joey.  That old gag.  All right.  We should get the catfighters in, because we're going to start the catfighting next.  Colin, you ever see girls catfight?  No, I really haven't.  Yeah.  They rip each other's claws off, clawing, biting.  I hear it's pretty hot.  Some of this dialogue is pretty saucy, actually. 
[01:14:30]  Pretty saucy out of the catfighting magazine?  Woo.  I told you I was going to kick your fat ass, you blonde bitch.  Nice.  Look at that.  Were you reading that or just talking to Norton?  That's what I...  Hey, I just figured something out.  That's Colin Quinn from Saturday Night Live.  Dick.  What?  I just figured it out.  You're a real sharpie, Opie.  You want to look at his taint?  No.  I just don't think I'd offer.  You can tell how many years the show has been on looking at my taint. 
[01:15:00]  We almost screwed him over really bad the other day.  Tell the horse story real fast.  We won't mention the horse, because it's still going to...  No, it's still...  No, mention that bomb.  It's late, anyway.  I mean, it's...  We saw...  The race is over, Opie.  We won the fifth at Belmont last week.  No, I know.  Well, I'm just thinking if the horse is racing again.  What was it called?  Presumed Innocent.  Presumed Innocent was the name of the horse.  He comes up and gives us a tip.  Well, we were out getting a pint before the show, what, last Thursday or Friday, and we 
[01:15:30]  run into Colin Quinn.  Did you go in that bar with the...  I didn't eat Italian food in 95 degree weather.  I admire that.  Did you even have a real parmigiano?  We hit the bar to get some Guinness before that.  We were at the bar near the OTB.  Ned Kelly's?  Yeah, it was.  That's it?  Yeah, we were grabbing some Guinness before the show.  And Colin caught up with us and gave us a tip on a horse.  I was strolling Mainz Avenue.  Yeah.  Gave us a tip on a horse.  He was so excited.  We're like, where the hell are you going?  He's like, I'm going to OTB.  I got this great horse.  And I'm pissed because we didn't have time to stop at OTB.  And then I'm kicking myself in the ass. 
[01:16:00]  I check the results.  And the horse comes in second.  You said, don't play it to win.  Yeah.  Do it across the board.  Win plays show.  And I could have made some money.  But the best part of that, Ant...  He's got a gambling problem.  He remembers everything I told him.  I was like, you said don't play it to win.  Belmont the horse.  The best part, though, Ant, was when Colin Quinn told us about the horse.  Yeah.  And we're like, how stupid are you?  We're going on the radio in five minutes.  I know.  And we could have completely destroyed your odds.  I would have been in, like, Gravesend Bay right now.  The three mob guys would have killed me for it.  You ruined the officials in you, loudmouth. 
[01:16:30]  Place a $2 bet.  You get $2.02 back.  $2.02 is two cents.  It's just awful.  I hate when that happens.  Some of our listeners voting on you.  He started at 20 to 1.  Betting on your horse.  Yeah, but it came in second.  So I was impressed.  I was like, wow, Colin Quinn's got a little connection, maybe.  Maybe.  There's more than that came from.  Oh, nice.  Hey, let's check out the girls.  Are they here?  Yeah.  Let's bring a couple of men.  Three lovely ladies.  Let's talk about the track more, because we're going to attract more 80-year-old listeners. 
[01:17:00]  Forget the girls.  Let's talk about the...  Nothing better than going to the track.  You watch the guys with the polyester pants up to their nipples, slapping their hand with  the rolled-up program.  Son of a bitch.  I had the three with the two and the five, and then I had the two with the five and the  three and the six.  Did you win?  No.  God damn.  Son of a bitch.  Cordero, you little monkey.  I used to love that when they'd yell at Cordero.  So, you go to watch the horses before the race in the paddock area, and they're yelling  at the jockey, you better win, Cordero, you little monkey. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Vasquez, you son of a bitch.  You're costing my house.  And they always have like, yeah, they always have like, uh, this guy flew in on his vacation  to ride this horse.  Yeah, yeah.  He cut his vacation short.  It's a short one.  It's a short thing.  Um, Jason, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  Yo, Ant, why don't you tell Colin about that horse that you bet on died in the middle of  the race or whatever the hell it was?  I had a horse drop dead on the back stretch at Belmont one day.  But, you know, I was pissed off that I didn't win, but it was kind of cool, because, you  know, you pay two bucks to watch a horse die. 
[01:18:00]  It's kind of fun.  Oh, yeah.  You know, and then they get the winch out there and just, they come along into the trailer.  They're heavy.  It's a dead horse.  They just hitch his mouth up and right into the trailer.  Wow.  I paid two bucks for that.  Named Jack Lemmon?  Jack Lemmon.  Died in the back stretch.  Hey, look at these ladies that are going to cast my thoughts in a few minutes.  Bring in the cat-fighting girls, finally.  Hey, nice.  Okay.  Wow.  A little better than me.  Whoa.  You look like some tough girls. 
[01:18:30]  Sexy.  Holy jeez.  Yeah, very sexy.  Sit down.  You're beautiful.  Take a seat.  Hey, Rick, let's get pictures taken right away and put it on the website so everyone can  see what they look like.  Let's just relax.  She looks like Debbie Maison.  Yeah, look at that.  I told you, she's like, watch it.  Yeah, you're going to watch.  Don't hit Colin Quinn.  Yeah, don't hit me.  He's a big star.  Hit, hit.  Hit me.  Smack me in the face.  She's smacking Colin Quinn.  She's already hit me.  You're up.  You're up. 
[01:19:00]  You ladies are part of Melee's crew?  Well, actually, Lexa is with Melee and Ariana is with my crew, the Den of Iniquity.  The Den of Iniquity.  Nice.  That's my dungeon.  I'm the proprietress.  Are you like a dominatrix?  I am.  Yeah, guys come to you to be humiliated, beaten.  They do.  Tied up, gagged, bound, kicked in the groin.  All that good stuff.  Do you do face-sitting?  Do you get pierced?  With my panties on, yeah.  How about that?  No reason for that.  Are you do that for a guy?  All the time. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  If the mood strikes me.  Yeah.  If the mood strikes me, yeah.  You've got to be, like, near a bathtub or something, because that makes a mess.  Well, we have special facilities.  Tarps and whatnot?  Yeah, we have incontinent pads that we use.  Incontinent pads?  You don't have any of those, Norton?  What's an incontinent pad?  What is that?  That's for Grandma when she can't hold it anymore.  It goes in the bed.  We use it.  We put it under the slave's head, you know, so that...  Isn't that bad when you need a whole bag?  Yeah, that's embarrassing.  In my life.  You have to use, like, 70-year-old props.  We have a room that is completely waterproof. 
[01:20:00]  A waterproof room.  It's got a jacuzzi, a bidet.  Anthony, that's great.  I'm looking at...  I like that.  I'm looking at the Den of Iniquity.  Iniquity.  Den of Iniquity.  Look at all these rooms.  Breathing stuff.  They have Waterworld, which is the medical room.  The medical room?  That's the one that's for some nurses come in.  Yeah.  And then they give you the...  An enema.  Enema.  That's the word for it.  Thank you.  Enema.  That's a great album by...  Oh. 
[01:20:30]  The Cyberdome.  That's the main dungeon, right?  And what is that?  It's about 1,200 square feet.  It's a traditional dungeon.  You know, it has your basics.  Your St. Andrew's Cross, your Catherine's Wheels, your...  Catherine's Wheels.  Stretcher racks.  Like your basic...  We have a futuristic kind of cyber theme to the room.  That's where we have...  But you've done a futuristic theme of an ancient dungeon thing.  What'd you say?  You've done a futuristic theme of an ancient dungeon, medieval...  Exactly.  The hell thought of that?  That's brilliant.  Do you just run the place or do you get naked?  No.  It is my place. 
[01:21:00]  I am the proprietress.  And yes, I am the headmistress.  And for the worthy slave, I have been known to be a bit of an exhibitionist at times.  Oh, yeah?  She's really hot.  She's very sexy, but I just don't understand the face sitting with panties.  I'm not saying you're very attractive.  Jim, you're hung up on that.  Yeah.  It's like, why do you have panties on?  I mean, there's no use if you can't put your nose in there like Caligula.  I mean, it's not Caligula.  Well, if you'd like, I could do a demonstration.  Maybe you'd like that with the...  Oh, man.  He looks a little scared now. 
[01:21:30]  No, no.  Norton will not back down.  Paralyzed.  I'm paralyzed with my whole...  I'm not into pain.  I don't like pain or spanking.  That never did anything for me.  Let her do a demonstration.  We won't even describe what she's going to do because now people understand what she's  going to do.  Do you have to smack him or something, though?  I won't go for that.  Because he doesn't like being smacked.  No, none of that.  I'm not into pain at all, but I like...  What do you like to do...  No one's ever done it to you, right, baby?  No, I don't want to be smacked.  Would you like to do the demonstration?  What'd you say?  With Jim?  I would be happy to do a demonstration with...  Jim, lay down.  What are you going to do?  You're not going to kick me or pinch my nipples hard or crack me around? 
[01:22:00]  No, I'm just going to do a little breath control.  Nah, I'm not...  Oh, nice.  All right.  We're going to try this.  And you're not going to bounce up and down hard on my head?  No, I'm not going to break you.  All right.  Don't do that.  I'm not going to break you.  Make it sweet.  Anthony, she also has...  Romantic.  I need a little romance, honey.  You know?  I don't know if that's getting through.  Yeah, let's tell you the truth.  Yeah, I don't know.  I might be dumping out of the way we're describing that.  Some of the other rooms, Anthony, they got the Queen's Spa for cross-dressing. 
[01:22:30]  That's what we had my nephew's christened.  It's a nice room, right?  And on that note, we do do weddings and bar mitzvahs.  Oh, Colin, you're going to be able to have it with us, man.  Oh, classic.  The boiler room, which is for kidnapping and interrogating.  Oh, is that like with the single light bulb dangling from the ceiling?  Oh, yeah.  The stark wood chair.  You beat people with phone books.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Hey, will you be...  Nice.  Will you be catfighting today? 
[01:23:00]  Please, please, please, please.  I may.  I may.  Good.  Okay.  The romper room, Anthony, which is the wrestling room.  We talked about Waterworld.  What else?  That's about it, right?  Those are the five now.  We're expanding probably to a second floor in about six months, and then we'll have more.  It's like Disney.  They're always expanding, right?  All right.  You never have too many dungeons.  Give me that mic, and let's have a demonstration with Norton, because Norton was disappointed on  how she does this, and I think he's going to change his mind after she's done. 
[01:23:30]  Possible.  Jim, get over here on the floor.  Actually, I think I should put a different pair of shoes on for this occasion.  Well, don't...  What do shoes have to do with that?  I'm not getting stepped on.  What is that?  It's like, Jim.  Because he doesn't like any of that.  I know.  I know.  She won't hurt.  You just want it to look good.  Well, I really feel like my heels should be very high when I'm...  All right.  Well, she's got a little altitude.  Jim, she's got...  Jim, we'll make sure nothing happens to you as far as being speared with a heel or something.  Yeah, I'm not into that.  That doesn't do it for me.  I know. 
[01:24:00]  I'm so not into that.  Jim, she's putting on special shoes for you.  She looks great.  She's gorgeous.  I don't like the pain thing.  I don't like the smacking stuff.  I like, you know, I like what they call romance.  Well, there's a lot of romance in S&M.  You think so?  Because every video clip I see on the web, it seems hurtful.  You know why?  Very hurtful.  That's because there are all these...  You can't have sex in bondage films.  So you're only allowed to do abusive things.  Well, you can't have sex in bondage films, so it's only bondage against the law. 
[01:24:30]  It implies rape, right?  Is that why?  Yeah, because you're depicting rape.  Yeah.  So you're not allowed to...  I should have asked Norton.  Of course he'd know.  Very up-to-date on these laws.  You know, so that's why they're not as sensuous as a real session would be, because we're  not allowed to be sensuous in our films, and everybody should write their congressman.  This is terrible.  Write your congressman.  Yeah.  You can show killings on every TV show.  Right on, man.  Killings, but no sex, man.  What's wrong with this country?  Write your congressman, but he's sleeping with a page or an intern right now.  He'll read it later. 
[01:25:00]  He's at the junction right now.  Hey, Mrs. Hot S&M lady?  Yes.  I noticed you're married.  I am.  Whoa.  I want to ask you something.  Seriously.  What does your husband think about that?  Well, he knew the story.  Before?  He knew before.  He knew getting in.  Does he get a little jealous?  No, not of the time that it takes away from him, but not of the activity.  Was he not only the mistress's husband, but also a client?  No.  One of those deals, no?  No.  Actually, he was my drinking buddy, and I'm bi, and we used to go and pick up chicks together,  and I just started to think he was a really swell guy. 
[01:25:30]  That's great.  Swell.  That's great.  Swell.  He was a swell guy.  I love beaver cleaver terminology.  Isn't that great?  Gee, that's swell.  They kidnap girls like Rick James and his wife.  That's a swell guy.  Wow, this is really keen, honey.  Okay, love been sweeter and more sensitive and nice and burning you on the thigh with  my crack pipe.  Isn't that great?  That says love.  All right, the hot lady.  What's her name again?  I forgot your name.  Tara, Indiana. 
[01:26:00]  Tara?  Tara, Indiana.  Indiana.  I want that alternative girl to do it to me.  You like that, right?  I have a missing person's fantasy from the next day.  Yeah.  The El Bosio.  That's good.  Yeah.  All right, we're over here now.  We're over here now.  All right, don't worry, Norton.  We'll protect you.  Norton's very tight.  He doesn't like pain.  No pain.  I'm gentle.  Yeah, he's a, you know, he might look like a rough and tumble guy, but...  Don't look at him.  Don't look at that. 
[01:26:30]  She's stroking his face right before she gives him a short right that'll put him on the floor.  Nice short hand right.  Bow.  Does he have to sign a release or something?  A release?  Speaking of release, I think he just did.  All right, now she's being sweet.  She's really weird.  She's being nice.  Tara can be very gentle.  Now he's on his knees.  How could your husband not be jealous of this?  And unzipping.  All right, she's unzipping her dress.  That's nice. 
[01:27:00]  A nice little gray number.  And he's a reel.  Whoa.  That's a nice reel.  Yeah, she's nice.  And there he goes.  He's getting...  Jim's getting a face full.  A face full, as they call it, of the upper section.  Jim?  There we go.  Jim, what do you think?  Jim, nice?  Jim.  Nice.  Are they real?  Oh, yes, they are.  They're lovely, I might add.  That's good.  And I'm one of the few people who has a .30-6D and can pass the pencil test. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, we would love to see the pencil test, sure, to make sure...  Her version, she thrusts it in Norton's eye.  It's a little different pencil test.  All right.  She's really romancing him.  How's this?  No, she's being nice.  Well, you kind of have to trick him a little bit.  Yeah.  I don't like tricks.  No, no, don't trick him.  You heard me.  Oh, please don't trick him.  Looks like she's ready to break his neck. 
[01:28:00]  That's great.  When she gets his head right between hers, it looks like the three-boobed girl from my movie, Portal Recall.  Open.  What the hell was that?  What the hell was that?  That's how a mistress kisses a slave.  By spitting in his mouth?  Right, Jim, did she just spit?  No, I don't think she actually spit.  I think it was more air.  I don't think she actually hocked into my mouth.  If I hear, oh, I'm moving.  That was a little, uh... 
[01:28:30]  That's unique, because that's how I greet my mom on holidays.  It's the same kiss.  Sometimes a peck on the cheek.  Sometimes hock-a-loogie in her mouth.  Now is...  Wow.  Okay.  Okay.  He's buried.  Actually, if this was Opie, he'd be telling her her age right now.  But no, it's Norton, and he's really getting a face full.  If you get locked up like that, make sure a car doesn't come.  That's how a blind guy tells the age.  That's how dogs say hello.  Well, Norton's on his back.  Let's just say that.  He's now reclined on the floor. 
[01:29:00]  This lady is very, very sexy.  Very sexy.  Very sexy.  She's got a way about it, but it's like tricking you.  She's tricking you.  Like a black widow spider.  You think you're just going to have some fun, and then before you know it, she's gnawing on your leg.  I've just been informed that she's not, uh...  Oh, wow.  Now you don't have to be informed.  You can see.  I can see for myself.  Oh, there's pantyhose right there.  That's right.  No.  But if there's pantyhose...  Okay.  And here goes, uh... 
[01:29:30]  Tara.  She's wearing pantyhose.  She's above, uh...  Jimmy.  There it is.  You getting a good eyeful there, Norton?  Nice.  Yeah.  For some reason now, um, she's got her hand in his face, and, uh, he's, he's, he's smelling her fingers for some reason, Opie.  Nice.  You realize we're a hundred feet from Carnegie Hall right now.  Isn't that a sin?  Tim?  And there... 
[01:30:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  All right.  What are you taking off your forehead?  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now she's finally ready to do what she said she would do about ten minutes ago.  Well, I told you.  Damn, Tara.  This is the move Tito Orteez did to Elvis to beat him in the Ultimate Fighting Championship last Friday.  I swear to God.  Same move.  She's one of the Gracie sisters.  It is.  It's Gracie.  Well, you know how you shut them up, finally.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:30:30]  Whoa.  All right.  Jim.  Jim.  Yes, Opie.  Jim, do you want to tap out?  No.  He's not tapping out.  My God.  Jim, can...  All I want to know is, are you...  Can you breathe?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to not be able to breathe.  Yeah, I can breathe.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's great, but when he inhales and exhales, our boobs get bigger and smaller.  What the hell is that?  Of course he can breathe. 
[01:31:00]  Wonderful.  All right.  Jim's getting smothered.  He is.  Uh, Jim?  No, she's feeling she's good.  She's very, very...  Do you like that?  Oh, beyond belief, yeah.  You are like the guinea pig for this show, Norton.  You get the best things happening to you.  What a fine job, the Opie and Anthony program have given me.  He's so happy.  He'll do anything, too.  No, I won't.  He had a girl in here the other day?  I don't like not being able to breathe.  My greatest fear is being buried alive in a coffin, but this is very nice.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  No, I don't go for that.  That doesn't...  My penis would shrink and run away if I didn't.  You know what he had done to him, or he did the other day?  We had a girl in here.  She was firing ice cubes.  Let's just say it wasn't from the front.  Wow.  She could fire ice cubes.  He took one after it was fired and put it in his mouth.  Hey, those are lovely.  Yeah, he'll do anything.  Those are really lovely.  A hot day.  Hey, Rick, are you taking pictures?  Those are all natural, too. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, those are...  Wow.  Wow, look at...  Oh, yeah.  They sit up nice.  Nice.  Right, Norton?  Nice.  What do you think, Jim?  I'm very pleased.  Yeah?  Sexy, but the wedding ring throws it off a little bit.  That is really weird.  I mean, she's having her husband fighting in the car.  Yeah, right.  So when you were doing that to him, did you like it?  Weird science.  All right, let's give him the great...  Weird science.  He's got the bra on his head.  I love making a little hat for this.  I feel like a football player from 1914. 
[01:32:30]  With the leather helmet.  How was that?  That's great.  In other words, you feel like GIF.  Maybe he should try a leg scissors, maybe a...  Yeah.  You don't want to hurt him.  He's not into the pain thing.  It wouldn't even be fun for him.  How about one more, you know, what you were doing before?  A little suffocation as the grand finale.  Not bad, though.  Nice, where I can breathe.  She was doing it nice.  They always respect him.  Yeah, let's do it as the grand finale, and then we'll take a break, and we'll get into  some cat fighting, finally.  Jim? 
[01:33:00]  Read through the regulator, and don't come up quick.  You'll get the bends.  Jim?  Yes.  Yeah, very good.  There he is.  The girl is very sexy.  He's so hot.  All right.  Hey, Fox News isn't filming this for some reason.  What, you can't pixelate that?  Just wipe the whole screen off.  Just play The Simpsons again during the whole show.  Sorry.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Open your mouth.  Oh.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Finger licking good. 
[01:33:30]  There you go.  Sure, why not?  Jim?  Yes, I'll...  Nice?  Nice.  Okay.  She's terrific.  That was...  Punch him in the face.  That was a nice...  Yeah.  That was a nice display right there.  Wow.  Oh, lovely.  And now we are going to get ready for some cat fighting.  Yeah, we have to take a quick break, and we'll do that outside the studio with the other  fine ladies that are here, okay?  Tara, you got a cat fight.  Is it the dungeon's name and phone number?  Yeah, you got it.  Yeah, after that, yeah, give it out again, please.

I didn't think it was going to go down today.  I thought Melee was pulling our leg.  I don't know.  But, oh, the mics are on out there. 
[01:36:30]  You can hear it.  We're going to move this whole mess outside the studio.  Your mic's not on?  No, it's unplugged.  Oh, that's better.  Jesus Christ, professionalism.  That sucks because the whole Stone Temple Pilots thing was funny, but no one else.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Maybe next time, okay?  Maybe next time.  All right.  Yeah, so we're just about ready for catfighting.  We're going to put pictures up on WNEW.com, I'm imagining.  I think we already sent some pictures up onto WNEW.com where they'll be up very, very soon. 
[01:37:00]  Also, I should remind the moms, this is the last day to qualify for the moms I'd like to  F contest, Anthony.  Yeah, you've got to come down now.  Get in under the wire.  The voting will start after the show tonight, sometime when Steve gets all the voting boots  up on foundrymusic.com.  We're not going to pick finalists.  We're just going to leave it up to the listeners.  Well, we're going to let them vote for the first couple of days, and then Friday we'll 
[01:37:30]  narrow it down.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Yeah.  Just vote for your favorite mom starting later on tonight.  But ladies, it's not too late.  If you're in the area and you want in on the contest, you better get down here so we can  get your pictures up on the internet for the moms I'd like to have contests.  Right.  Got that trip to Myrtle Beach.  Thanks, Spirit Airlines.  Also, Samsung for giving us that DVD slash VCR player, which is very, very cool.  All in one.  All in one.  All right.  Are we ready to move this mess outside for catfire?  Yeah.  Let's take it outside into the ring. 
[01:38:00]  I got that.  Thank you, Ben.  Ben's got that, Opie.  Ben's got that.  He's going to take care of my mic.  And.  Ow!  That's my headphone cord.  I just lost an ear.  Yeah, people step on the head.  Opie's headphone cord is three feet long.  He's like hunched over because it's going to pull out of the box. 
[01:38:30]  This is great.  This is great.  We can't even do a remote from right outside the studio door.  We're pathetic.  All right.  Look, now we've got a hell of a dally storm going here.  What the?  All tangled up.  Where's everybody?  I'm out here.  Ant's out here.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got a Colin Quinn over there.  We have the, uh, what a, what a pathetic ring this is.  It's pretty much, it's a sheet that's been taped down and there's pillows underneath it that I guess, um, John went to Bed Bath & Beyond and bought it. 
[01:39:00]  Only the best for our show, Anthony.  Are those pillows or are those the kids from Houston?  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  You know.  Jim.  See, Fox TV, I guess there isn't a limit.  There is not a line.  We were talking about the line earlier with Fox.  Speaking of Fox News, Anthony.  Yeah.  You notice that more and more camera crews are showing up as, as we move on with this show today? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Oh, what's up with that?  I think they're making excuses to come down here to cover our show today because they know what we're doing.  Yeah, it's cat fighting.  And, um, I'm looking forward to this.  Mele is here.  She kind of got a couple of the girls.  The girl's back there now.  Let's, uh, smoking and drinking.  I thought smoking was bad for, uh, girls.  What's that?  Because I thought you would run out of breath.  Yeah, walk up to the mic.  Yeah, one of the cat fighters is smoking. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah?  It helps you warm up.  Yeah, it's good for my lung.  Pharmaceutical tobacco.  All right.  Hey, hey.  Only, only pharmaceutical tobacco, just for the doctor's perspective.  All right.  By the way, what are you wearing there?  Nice little, uh...  PJs.  Yeah.  PJs.  But, uh, this is what was selected for my apparel this evening, and, uh...  Who the hell bought that?  I guess the shoes have got to go, don't they?  You just made a really sexy girl look dull and boring.  This girl is sexy. 
[01:40:30]  It's like a...  You guys have this...  It's like a...  It's like a...  It's like a...  It's like a pillow party, like pillow fight.  Pillow fight, slumber party.  Yeah.  I got you.  That's right.  Who brought the pajamas?  I was ready.  I got it.  Who are you?  Boo.  Just a listener.  Just a listener.  You picked some of the unsexiest pajamas.  My God.  That girl went from a 10 to...  That girl went from a 10 to a 3.  Oh, I can never be a 3.  A 3, Opie.  Well, come off.  Come on.  Who'd you get them from?  Your grandmother?  They were awful.  I know.  Aren't those just...  I'm not going to say.  Are those maternity PJs? 
[01:41:00]  I mean, what the hell is going on with those?  Awful.  We can't do anything right.  That's all right.  All right.  Because if it was up to us, we wouldn't...  If he left it to us, we wouldn't have any PJs.  Well, thank you for bringing them down.  No matter how unsexy they are.  There's someone out there who's really turned on by the fact that I'm wearing my PJs.  Ah, no.  No one is.  Dressed like Hester Prince.  Someone else's PJs.  Someone else's dirty PJs.  Okay.  How is this going to work today?  Are we going to do Opie and Anthony rules? 
[01:41:30]  What are those?  I don't even know what Opie and Anthony rules are.  Well, basically, the girl that loses her clothes first...  No, because you want them naked, both of them fighting.  What are you talking about?  One girl gets her clothes ripped off, and then you stop it?  No.  First girl that bleeds from the ears.  No.  Anywhere.  All right.  The shoes are coming off.  What do you want to do?  Like a three-minute round, and then we'll figure out who won or something?  That's great.  You know what those...  Markets of Queensberry rules.  Markets of Queensberry rules. 
[01:42:00]  To submission or to a pen?  Huh?  To submission or to a pen?  Submission style or to a pen?  All we care about is that you're going to lose some clothes.  Yeah, that'll probably happen.  Okay, now, those of you who've been married 20 years, and you come home, and your wife  is wearing those PJs.  That's exactly what that is.  Walking around the house.  And then she wonders why you're having an affair on the side.  You're not in the moment.  I'm a wreck of itch.  All right, who is the other...  I mean, period, those are the PJs you wear.  Those are period PJs, right.  Period, pen fighting. 
[01:42:30]  Ready?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hey, hold on.  We have a bell for a reason, and we have to talk to the other fighter.  What's your name?  Lexa Khan.  All right.  Lexa Khan.  I get it.  Lexa Khan.  Now, how many fights have you had?  This will be my first legitimate cat fight, I suppose.  What's the legitimate ones?  Just being a dirty, rotten fighter.  Nice. 
[01:43:00]  No fair fights here.  And how many fights have you had?  Oh, I was on wrestling teams in high school, so I've been catfighting and wrestling for longer than I'd like to say and date myself.  Some good bitch fights.  I like it.  This is sort of an unfair, you know...  You're going to lose.  But I don't know any, you know, legit, you know, wrestling maneuvers, so...  Well, maybe I'll show you a few.  Well, since it's illegal and you have to pay money to use the Michael Buffer line,  and let's just say, let's prepare to fight! 
[01:43:30]  Go down on the floor, right?  Yes.  Leave it at that.  Okay, here we go.  We are ready to...  Here they go.  They're squared off.  Or what?  And they're on the pillows, and...  All right, a little leg take down.  Oh!  Took it down like Steve got taken down by a Tito Ortiz.  That's a professional...  Oh, there's some hair pulling.  Hair pulling is definitely...  Oh, scissor around the neck!  Oh, wow. 
[01:44:00]  The other girl got really pissed because Tara pulled her hair.  Yeah.  Now Tara's pulling.  I'll pull back!  All right, they're pulling each other's hair.  I pull back!  Nice and hard, Anthony.  Oh, she's in the scissor hole.  The scissor hole is very painful to the midsection, Opie.  What is it, shoulders to the floor?  Me?  Hell no!  I'm on top, bitch!  Do you?  Yeah.  All right, they're really fighting.  Oh, whoa!  Whoa, nice move!  Now she's got her around the head.  Yeah, this is starting to get real serious now. 
[01:44:30]  The one in the Jan Brady blue...  Oh, now she's hitting her.  She's spanking her.  Blue PJs.  Oh, a little butt spanking going on there.  Wait, is the fight over?  I just needed a breath break.  She's out of breath.  Kick her ass!  My hair was shoved down my throat!  Her hair was shoved down her throat, Anthony.  I need a worthy opponent.  Tara's not happy with her opponent.  How about one of these guys?  Get in there and rip her goddamn clothes off.  Yeah, screw the hair pulling. 
[01:45:00]  Let's pull on some clothes.  Here we go.  All right.  They're never coming off.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  They don't rip.  Oh, great.  What'd you get?  Tough skin PJs?  Wait, I got a good party.  Oh, there they go.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the top of the PJs.  Oh, those are ripping off now.  Completely ripped off of Tara.  Those pink ones are chain mail.  That isn't even coming off.  It's like ancient times.  Shred.  Shred.  All right.  Oh, she's got her in a chokehold.  Opie looks familiar. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, she's got...  Oh, pull that hair.  It's in the back.  Oh, man.  Nice.  And again, the scissor hold and the chokehold.  Wow, the girl on the bottom's really got the advantage.  No, she just slipped the hold.  Pulling more.  More hair pulling.  The hair is really getting...  Yes, the hair is a pain in the ass.  Wow.  Wow, this is getting too real.  They're turning red.  They're getting all scratched up. 
[01:46:00]  Tara's got her in a headlock.  Oh, she's punching her in the cab.  More spanking.  Oh, and the bra pretty much coming off now.  All right.  That white bra is kind of off the shoulder.  What the hell are you doing?  They're sizing each other up again.  Uh-oh.  The bra is being pulled on now.  Yeah, now we're seeing something.  I just needed to get a little...  Sorry, I'm a jaffer.  And the bra's off, and she's working like a speed bag. 
[01:46:30]  That's good.  Hey, look at that.  Both girls.  Oh, another takedown.  Have lost the top half of their...  The uniforms.  The top halves are gone.  They are just wearing those ridiculous little PJ shorts.  Well, the one girl has two door knockers.  Wow, she's getting choked out.  You can't make me laugh.  I already can't breathe.  She's getting choked out.  Yeah, kick her with something.  I've got to go into the show to see the bottom one.  Oh, no.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, we'll all jump in and rip your panties off. 
[01:47:00]  I swear to God.  I'm a flipper and a flogger and a caner, not a wrestler.  But we want to see them completely.  I think she did really well, though.  I think she did pretty good.  I don't wrestle.  What do you guys think of the ladies?  And now she's smacking her boobs.  They still have underwear.  Yeah, I know.  You wrestle.  You come and play.  By the way, we know Fox News is never going to use this footage.  They better give us a copy of this tape.  I know.  I'm already tired.  All right.  Is anyone else going to wrestle here today? 
[01:47:30]  I don't know.  These are my asses.  How about Bridget Nielsen over there?  She's been a boy.  Yeah?  Melee.  Melee, the old broad's going to wrestle.  Melee.  Oh, Jesus.  That's nice.  I'm called the old broad.  What are you, insane?  You're absolutely right.  His mama did not bring him up right.  No, of course not.  That's great.  When she gets you in a leg lock with those great pubes, you look like Phil Donahue.  It's cool.  It's cool.  For a second, you look just like her.  It's great.  Not really.  Well, just for that, you're not going to see anything. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, come on.  We want to see that.  Melee is about to wrestle Tara.  Tara's already without Tom.  All right.  Here they go.  Oh, wow.  She's rocked.  She's a tough bitch.  Look at this.  Wow.  Melee is kicking her ass.  Oh, Melee is brutal.  Melee is brutal.  This girl doesn't have a chance.  Now, Melee is pulling her hair.  She's got it down.  She's punching her.  Oh, this is terrible.  Is this a sanctioned fight, Anthony? 
[01:48:30]  This is...  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Guess who's not wearing underwear, Anthony?  Wow.  Doesn't it look like that scene in...  What was that one with Joan Crawford and Christina?  Because I'm not one of your fans!  Oh, fighting.  Fighting going on, Anthony.  Tara's fighting back with somebody.  Oh, come on.  Melee just...  Oh, she's fighting her.  Look at the teeth marks on her arms.  It's all over.  I love this thing. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Melee is a rugged...  You're like a tank.  I told you.  All right.  All right.  Let's...  Wow.  Let's get them in the corners again and size them up again here.  Phew.  Wow.  Melee turns into...  She is wild.  Oh, my God.  Ever since she got out of the tub in The Shining, I've been a fan of her.  Who did this to you? 
[01:49:30]  Listen.  Wow.  Melee just...  I guess she has to drop some weight of the clothes, so she took them off.  Wow.  Okay.  Hold on.  They're sizing up again.  Tara and Melee.  Hey, Melee, what's on your right boob there?  What is that?  It's a little heart.  It's a heart?  Is it a tattoo, though?  Or...  And where is your torso?  All right.  Okay.  Here they go.  Here you go.  Oh.  Nice.  Oh, man.  Now they're standing up. 
[01:50:00]  Melee got her in a headlock again.  Nice.  They're screaming.  Oh, purple nurples.  Oh, they're tweaking.  They're tweaking with the purple nurple move.  Oh, now Melee throwing her weight down on top of this girl, which could really hurt.  Feet in the air now.  It's...  Oh, she's got...  She's on top of Melee now.  Oh!  Oh!  She's smacking Melee's ass.  There's slapping going all over the place now. 
[01:50:30]  Her groin looks like Gorilla Monsoon.  Thank you, what's the problem over there?  Bill Donahue's toupees coming out.  Oh, no.  I thought it was a guest appearance by George the Animal Steel.  Here in our own studio.  Victory is mine!  You got her pinned by her ankle.  All right, here's the deal.  You both have one fall here, so we've got to do the third one.  All right.  Three falls.  Melee won the first one.  Tara won the second.  This is for all the marbles. 
[01:51:00]  Melee, you're going to really have to, uh...  Oh, forget it.  I don't know what she's going to have to do.  What do I know?  I don't know what this is.  By the way, Rick has taken a million pictures.  This is the scene they cut out of Vision Quest.  Colin Coyne, everyone.  Okay, here's Melee in the left corner.  Tara in the right corner.  You ladies ready?  This is it.  What's up, Melee?  You want some water?  You want some water? 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  All right, they're in their respective corners.  A little water break.  Melee, just like an armored personnel carrier.  You are, like, stocky.  Melee, I'm not going to make fun of you anymore, because...  I wouldn't...  You're serious.  And you see her eyes now?  She's all worked up.  She's in the zone.  You're good.  She's in the zone.  Well, no, I said you're in the zone.  I said you're in the zone.  That's nice.  What, she threw water at me, Opie?  I can't believe...  Could have been worse.  I'm going to run away. 
[01:52:00]  She could have run to change on you.  Don't make me expose myself to the big pussy I am.  And who would want to see what you got?  Oh, bell!  There's the bell.  Start the fight.  Oh, my God, save me.  Please.  Oh, my God.  I like the way this is...  Oh!  Nice.  All right, Tara with a huge takedown, Anthony.  Swifts her over her back.  Tara is kicking Melee's eggs.  I hope Tara kills Melee, because I'm screwed.  What? 
[01:52:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, now they're in this trying submission holds on each other.  She's fighting Melee's arm, and now Melee's pulling her hair.  Melee's getting really pissed.  Tara bit her arm, and Melee...  Oh, now she's tweaking.  Purple Nurple.  Purple Nurple again.  She is Yankee on the chest.  Wow.  Wow.  I got it.  Purple Nurple.  I am Nillix.  Oh, yes.  Thank me, baby.  Yeah!  Woo!  Woo!  This is horrifying. 
[01:53:00]  Okay, Tara's trying...  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's got the face hold on her.  Melee's got the face hold.  Tara's trying to fight her way out, Anthony.  Tara having trouble with Melee.  Oh, no, Tara.  Tara got loose.  Tara on top of...  Oh, it takes Melee down.  But Melee really holding her own here.  She's on top of Melee.  Get in there with the bike, Stiggs.  A senior citizen being beaten.  Hey, Norton, why are you saying that, Norton, about Melee?  Okay.  I get the couple lines.  I'm going to climb.  What are you doing? 
[01:53:30]  Oh!  Melee, is she tapping out?  Is she tapping out?  It's over.  Power emerges victorious.  Melee taps out.  Spotting the choke hold.  Wow, that was...  Now they're hugging.  Look at that.  Sportsmanship, Anthony.  Yeah.  Tara, how do you feel?  I feel great.  Yeah.  I feel great.  Unbelievable.  I won fair and square.  Wow.  Great job.  Wow.  I've ever fought for her.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  She's good, huh?  It's the first time we fought.  She's good.  She's good, too.  Melee, how do you feel?  How do you feel, Melee?  I feel stimulated.  Did you hear all the...  The adrenaline is just pumping.  Unbelievable.  Did you hear all the rude comments that this man was saying?  I hear you.  Okay, she said, do you think I'd give an F?  Do I get to keep these PJs?  Yeah.  Yes.  They're different from my normal latex and leather.  I know.  Take it that way, all right?  This is not fake.  This is real.  Your adrenaline is pumping, and everything you've got goes into this. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, are there any guys that want to fight Melee?  No, no.  No.  Any guys want to get in there with Melee?  Give it a whirl?  Rick is even saying no.  No?  Any guys?  No.  Wow.  Look at that.  Give him a headlock over there.  She scared everyone away.  No one wants to fight her.  Yep.  Meow.  I'll say it first.  I ain't fighting.  What, Melee?  He doesn't have what it takes, and he's not a sports person.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, you could kick Jim's ass.  Probably, yeah.  He's a strong loser. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, I'll weigh me by four counties.  Hell for you.  Okay.  You got you.  Why don't we take a break?  Are you going to wrestle?  Security code red.  Code red.  How about the guy from Planet Java?  Yeah, right?  Why doesn't she wrestle?  Who?  Her.  She's tall.  I can teach her how to wrestle.  You want to wrestle?  Is that your boyfriend?  I won't get naked.  You don't have to get naked.  Just wrestle?  Just let the naked woman beat you up. 
[01:55:30]  Well, why don't we take a break, and we'll figure this out.  All right.  Okay, sounds good.  We're catfighting on the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie.  Wow.

[01:57:30]  That'll be later on tonight.  We'll give out the websites after the next break, okay?  Because we're trying to get pictures up there right now.  Jim, is that mic on?  I don't know.  Is it on?  Yeah, that's on.  I'm taking off, so I just wanted to say goodbye.  Have a great time at the road show.  I'll be in Vegas with Dice.  Oh, I know.  Pick-ass time on Saturday.  Damn.  We're going to bring catfighting to the all-day road show at the Stone Pony, I think, on Saturday.  Have a good one in the parking lot.  Rattle.  Because it's unbelievable.  I mean, it's one thing to have it on the radio.  You've got to see it in person. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  Because these ladies, I mean, they're serious about it.  You know, it's not just fooling around like, oh, let's get naked.  It's weird.  Right at the beginning, they're a little more lax than you'd think they'd be.  And then, before you know it, one of them does something that pisses the other one off a little bit.  And then they start going.  And the hair pulling, the punching, the biting.  The sweating.  The sweat.  Is the monitor off out there?  The monitor's off and programming note for Saturday.  It's a go.  Catfighting on stage.  At the road show. 
[01:58:30]  Holy S.  Nice.  Stone Pony this Saturday.  We're expecting a lot of people from Philadelphia to come up.  Of course, the New York audience.  You guys in the other markets are S out of luck on this one.  It's an all-day road show.  It's a Stone Pony.  It's going to be unbelievable.  Doors open at noon, I believe.  Melee smells like Trenton, New Jersey.  Like a blimpy restaurant.  Stinky had the field mic.  And he was not happy about it, man.  But you were catching some wafts. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, it was disgusting.  When they hit the mat and the air would just come up.  It was waffing.  Yes.  That was disgusting.  It was waffing.  Who's going to mess with Melee, though, now?  No one.  No.  She is serious about her catfighting.  Isn't that big chick out there doing it?  Yeah, we're going to go back out in a second.  We just need to take a breather and kind of get some fresh air.  She smells like Luca Brasi's vest.  The other thing, Anthony.  I've got to remind people at the Roadshow this coming Saturday. 
[01:59:30]  We have a wet t-shirt contest and all wet t-shirt contests.  Yeah.  It's going to be a good one.  We are going to give away $1,000 to first place.  Where did we get that?  $1,000.  We've got to thank Whipped Cream Bikini and MafiaMob.com.  All right.  For sponsoring the wet t-shirt contest.  A grand.  A grand for the lady that wins the wet t-shirt contest this Saturday at the Stone Pony.  That ought to bring in some ringers.  And then we've got the catfight.  You guys know. 
[02:00:00]  The roadshows are legendary.  Oh, yeah.  And just announced?  Yeah.  Dickie Betts.  Dickie Betts?  The Dickie Betts from the Allman Brothers is going to do some acoustic songs for us as well.  All right.  It's shaping up to be a great roadshow.  Cool.  So, yeah, the nerds are playing.  I know.  It's just going to be amazing.  You're going to put Earl in the dunking booth?  Earl's going to be in the dunk booth.  We're going to have a lesbian pool, right?  Yep.  It's just insane.  We're kind of going with a little festival with our roadshow this time around.  Is that what it's going to be? 
[02:00:30]  It's going to be a little something happening over here, a little something over here.  We're going to have the stage.  We've got the ocean right there.  O-N-A-A-Palooza.  Something like that.  Oh, my God.  I just got this injunction from them saying not to call it that.  Anytime you put a palooza at the end of anything, you get an injunction.  Hey, our buddy Roy's checking in from Dallas.  Hey, Roy.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Roy, how the hell are you?  Hey, I heard y'all last night.  I don't want to call y'all from Dallas.  Yeah.  You heard the show last night in Dallas? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And why?  This old Russ.  Hi.  That's Russ Martin.  That's what we have to put up with.  Oh, yeah.  You're listening to it.  Just like that.  Well, listen, Roy, tonight on the show in Dallas, you're going to hear catfighting.  All right.  All the way to hear today's show down there, you're going to love it.  Let me tell you there, Roy.  Y'all be, hey, old Ron and Don walked off the show Friday, Friday.  Why?  Friday, Friday?  Yeah, they got mad about something.  Something?  God damn.  All right, Roy, no one cares about what you're saying. 
[02:01:30]  Roy, are you?  Are you smoking?  I don't know who the hell I'm talking about.  Roy, are you smoking pot?  Yeah.  God damn.  Smoking that whack in the baggie.  Uh-huh.  All right, Roy.  Hey.  Yeah.  How come I ain't never on the radio at night when I turn it on?  Y'all always cut me out?  No, we don't cut you out.  No, let's do it on that.  No one does.  Maybe the radio station's cutting you out.  Why would they cut out Roy?  I guess we're talking about their people down there, huh?  Smoke weed every day.  They don't want to know if it's Don and Ron, if it's going to get fired, everybody down 
[02:02:00]  there knows.  All right, Roy.  Roy, maybe you just pass out before your time on our.  I watch it.  It comes on at 11 to 2 down there.  You watch it?  Yeah, I watch it and listen to it, too.  All right, Roy, we got to go.  We got more catfighting.  All right, bye.  Listen to that.  Bye, New York.  All right.  Let me go to Martin.  Martin, what's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony, what's up?  What's up?  All right.  Hey, look, I got a question for Opie.  Yeah.  How can you even let that woman whip your butt, man?  You would have enjoyed it.  Me?  She wasn't after me.  She was after Anthony.  No, she was after Anthony. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Get out of here, tool.  Come on, man.  Yeah, I want a piece of that, right.  Yeah, that's my dream come true, to have her beating the crap out of me, ass, D, F, tool,  jerk off, snot, crap, dick, jerk.  Why would I like that?  What?  You don't find that hot and sexy?  Oh, what?  You're not going to beat you up and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I want that. 
[02:03:00]  Having a smelly 52-year-old lady on your back.  Oh, stop, Opie.  I'll have to crank one out right here if you keep talking like that.  Yeah.  And a coffin.  Me crab.  All right, we've got to get out there and see if we've got some more catfight to go.  And listen, guys, don't all come running to my mother-effing defense, either, next time  she steps up to me like that.  Not one person stepped up to help.  She's standing right in front of my face, like, really ready to go wild. 
[02:03:30]  She threw water at you?  Yeah, no one said a word.  No.  No one said a word.  Everyone's quiet and backs away, leaving me to the wolves.  Oh, yeah.  And I don't mean to demean wolves like that.  All right, man.  Let's get back out there.  All right.  It's a very professional thing, so I've got to unplug my mic here and plug it back in.  And I've got my phone.  All right.  All right.  Is this thing on?  No.  Hello.  Hello. 
[02:04:00]  Is this thing on?  Hello.  I don't hear myself.  I don't either.  Yeah, we must be on.  I think the headphone jacks aren't on.  Oh, there we go.  Now I hear myself.  Okay.  Melee.  We're experiencing technical difficulties.  Come here.  What's going on, Melee?  And we wanted to give it to one of the audience people that we hear, but I don't know who,  so I'm going to leave it up to you.  Oh, my God.  I hope he's touching her.  I gave her.  He comes arm around her.  So it'd be fair.  Okay.  It smells like ass.  Thank you, Melee.  I will give this video to, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Okay.  There it is.  File it.  Okay.  What do we got going on out here now?  Who is this hot guy?  Who are you?  Melissa.  You're here for the Moms I'd Like to F contest?  Yes.  You're a mom?  Yeah.  How old are you?  24.  You're 24.  How old is your kid?  Two.  Two.  Let me do some complicated math.  Wow. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  You don't look like a mom.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I'm 13.  You look like you're 13.  She is hot.  Where's your husband?  Oh, that's...  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  Yeah, we want to talk to you.  Okay.  What's happening?  Thanks for bringing your piece of...  Dude.  Nice.  Nice score.  How'd you hook up with her?  Lucky.  You got lucky.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Well, hang out for a minute, because we're going to do a little catfighting, then we're  going to take your pictures for the Moms I'd Like to F contest, okay? 
[02:05:30]  And we'll get her pictures up with the rest of the contestants.  Right.  She is a guaranteed finalist.  Yeah, that's finalist.  Let me tell you something, Anthony.  I'm going to go out on a limb.  Yeah.  She is guaranteed to win a prize.  You think guaranteed to win a prize?  I think...  Let me look.  If not the trip to Myrtle Beach.  Yeah, you're going to Myrtle Beach.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, guys.  Yes, Rick.  Guys, check out some of the remnants of the last fight.  Hey, what is that stuff?  That's...  Wow, look at that.  There's like clumps of hair all over the catfighting. 
[02:06:00]  Any gray?  Matt.  Yeah, the girls are pulling each other's hair out.  And a lot of spots.  That's all I'll say.  A lot of spots.  Spotting?  There's a lot of spotting on the sheet.  No, there's a spot there, spot there, spot over there.  Okay, Stinky, why don't we talk to our next competitor in the catfighting?  We only have like a short mic cord.  What a mess.  There you go.  Are you a professional catfighter?  I am a professional... 
[02:06:30]  I work with Tara.  Oh, you do?  Down at the dungeon?  Yes, at the dungeon.  What's your specialty?  Yeah.  What's my specialty?  Edge play.  What's that?  Knives?  We had a girl on the show that got turned on by having a knife like, you know...  I know a lot of people like that.  Dragged along her body.  I know a lot of people like that.  It's some of the best audio ever.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's just like, ah, really freaking out about it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a very good flogger.  Flogger?  Wait, what's the edge thing?  Because you said it's not... 
[02:07:00]  Oh, yes, yes.  Oh, it is the knives.  Razors.  Razors.  Razors, do you actually cut people?  Maybe you should come find out.  No.  No.  Maybe I won't.  Anthony, I cut.  I cut, okay?  Um, yeah.  But you've never catfighted?  Oh, yes, I have.  I have.  Yeah, okay.  This lady, I don't think she's ever done anything like this in her life.  Nope.  Hi.  And why are you here?  I came to watch.  But now you're just going to get involved. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  All right.  They called me out.  What the hay-ho?  It's a tall girl coming at it.  How tall are you?  Six foot.  Six foot.  Have you been in any fights?  Only with my brothers.  Really?  Oh, grew up with brothers?  Yeah.  That might be good.  All right.  And what's your name?  Kim.  Kim.  And what's your name again?  Ariana.  Ariana.  Yeah.  All right.  Ariana and Kim.  And once again, Ariana has the grandma pajamas on.  God.  All right.  A few ladies would both step into the ring.  And, um, uh-oh. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Let's, uh, they're squared off.  And let's, um.  What, Opie?  What, Opie?  On three, okay?  It's Kim and Ariana.  We'll just give it the bell.  They're staring at each other.  One, two.  And they're off.  There they go.  All right.  Kim is, uh.  Kim, uh, tried the takedown.  Ariana got on her.  And now Kim.  Ariana went for a trophy.  Kim's on the bottom.  Wow.  Ariana's got her in a scissor thing and kind of did a reverse move.  Ariana's trying to get out of this hole. 
[02:08:30]  Ariana's outweighed in this match here.  Definitely a difference in, uh, weight class and size class.  Kim trying to get back up on her feet.  Ariana on her back now.  And they're trying to, they're both up now trying to get the other one down.  Kim is the Andre the Giant of catfighting.  Oh, my.  Oh, Ariana's holding her own, though.  She's on top of, uh, tall Kim right now.  I like that move, uh, Kim did.  She spanked Ariana when she had the opportunity.  All right.  Hold on.  They're off the mat.  Let's, uh, separate. 
[02:09:00]  And get back on the mat.  I believe Ariana won that fall, Anthony.  You think so?  Got her out of the, got her out of the rings.  Ariana, how are you feeling?  Pretty good?  Great.  Okay.  And Kim?  Kim, how are you feeling?  You've never done this before.  I'm okay.  A little out of breath.  Hey, by the way.  Tough competitor.  By the way, I, I, you don't want to get naked.  That's okay.  But you, you could get her naked just for us.  Are you cool with that?  Yeah, she's cool with that.  Rip her clothes off.  Hey, what happened to the, the Fox News reporter? 
[02:09:30]  She's seen enough?  Oh, there she is.  Way back there.  In the corner.  She doesn't want to be on film at all, Anthony.  Okay.  Here we go.  They're going to square off again.  It's Kim and Ariana.  Yeah, she's real cool with you ripping off her clothes.  Trust me.  Let's try.  One, two, three.  And they're off.  And, oh, oh, wow.  Kim going right for the clothes now.  Kim is just ripping at Ariana's clothes.  Ariana's trying to flip Kim.  Wow.  Now she's going for the bottoms. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, there's nothing.  They're kind of just, Kim, a lot of power, but not really the skill.  Ariana got Kim in a choke hold a little bit.  And now.  Ariana's biting Kim's hand.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, oh, she's got, got her top now.  See, this is what happens.  Then they get pissed, and they realize it's real.  Kim is trying to rip off Ariana's top.  That is some tough material.  Uh-oh.  A little leg kick.  Now they've parted.  They're kind of breathing heavy.  They're circling each other, trying to catch some breath, and now back in the clinch. 
[02:10:30]  Ariana is getting her top ripped right off by Kim.  There it goes.  Down to her black bra.  The crowd very happy with that move.  Oh, the wedgie.  Oh, the power wedgie.  She's going for her body.  Kim gave Ariana a power wedgie.  They're fighting pretty good now.  Oh, my God.  Kim's on top of Ariana.  Ariana's holding her own, though.  Yes, Ariana's doing a great job, but that power wedgie had a hurt.  She looked like Celine Dion in that jumpsuit with the big camel toe. 
[02:11:00]  Okay, that was pulled up pretty tight.  All right.  Ariana's down to just black panties and a black bra.  What's going on in there?  What's going on in there?  They're changing your phone number.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  And Kim has Ariana down.  No, but Ariana squeezes out of it.  There's clothing laying all over now.  Kim is red all over her back.  Spider, spider.  Uh-oh.  Ariana in some scissors. 
[02:11:30]  Kim looks like she doesn't really...  Not affected by it.  No.  Ariana is now on Kim's back, trying to get her in that half-Nelson.  A lot of...  They're having some time breathing at this point.  Yeah.  Come on, Ariana.  Uh-oh.  That could be a dangerous move.  Kim is trying to pick up Ariana.  Ariana is now on Kim's back.  Riding her.  She's riding Kim.  Yeah, fall backwards.  All right, break, break.  Let's get back to the corner here. 
[02:12:00]  Hold on.  We got one more line here.  That was a draw.  That was a draw.  One more round was a draw.  I don't know if Ariana is going to make the belt in the third round, Anthony.  No.  Stinky, is Ariana going to make it out?  What?  You want to substitute, or are you going to make the third round?  You can't put in a substitute, a French substitute?  Are you insane?  What about Kim?  Kim's a lot taller, though, Anthony.  It doesn't matter.  He's out of shape.  He's out of breath.  Kim's a lot more out of shape.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  There's no issue over here.  He's got skill.  I beat guys much bigger than me. 
[02:12:30]  Really?  He's got much, much bigger than me.  Okay.  What is Tara saying?  Get up here, Tara.  I beat guys a lot bigger than me, because when you're small, it's hard to get you in a hold,  and you can squirm out of it.  Sure.  Yeah.  No, I beat guys that were like 6'3", 250 pounds.  Hey, Tara.  And the other thing is, I'm double jointed all over my body, and I feel absolutely no pain.  Yes, you are.  So, even if they get me in a hold, it doesn't bother me.  I mean, if you put a leg scissor around me or something, I don't feel nothing.  Really?  I feel no pain.  Hey, Tara?  Yeah.  You're a very hot lady. 
[02:13:00]  Could you lose the grandma pajamas?  The grandma pajamas?  Yeah, it's just...  But I'm not wearing any panties.  That was never a problem in this place.  If you could get me a pair of panties, I'd take them off.  Well, where are those black things that...  Those had a big pocket in the front.  All right.  Melee's going for some substitute things.  This is the Ariana show.  Okay.  Ariana and Kim are going to go at it one more time here.  All right.  Let's get back in the ring.  They've had a little break.  Ariana has just a black bra and her black panties on.  Ariana has one round.  The second was a draw. 
[02:13:30]  Here's the third one.  Third and final round.  Kim could tie it up, or Ariana could win.  They are back in the ring, and let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Kim and Ariana.  Oh, they're spinning.  Oh, my God.  They spit water at each other.  Okay.  Wow.  What a brutal move.  Kim is getting really good.  Oh.  Wow.  Ariana took Kim down.  Big, big, big.  Ariana won that hole.  Come on.  Stand up.  No, she's out.  She's choking her out.  She's out of the ring.  Out of the ring. 
[02:14:00]  Ariana won that.  She won that ball.  Why?  It's out of the ring?  Yeah.  That's what we did last night.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  You guys.  No, that just fell out of the ring.  They have to end it in the ring with a pin.  Are you sure you have to go?  Submission move.  One, one.  This is for the win.  Okay.  Look at your legs, man.  All the bite marks and the red.  Damn.  I didn't bite.  All right.  Here's Ariana and Kim.  Ready?  This is for the match, Anthony. 
[02:14:30]  They're sizing each other up.  Ariana.  Two kicks going in now.  All right.  They're still standing.  We're waiting for a flip.  We're some kind of.  Oh, wow.  Whoa.  Okay.  Here.  Whoa.  Some real battling going on now.  Yeah.  They're both.  It's very.  Both very wily.  And squirrely.  Whoa.  Okay.  They're down on the mat.  They're off the mat again.  Kim is trying to pin. 
[02:15:00]  Okay.  They're back on the mat.  Oh, my God.  Look how red she's getting.  That's hysterical.  Ariana's on Kim's back with a choke hold.  They're getting really tired now, Anthony.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Uh-oh.  Ariana's got her in a choke hold, Anthony.  Tap out.  If you want to tap out.  She's out.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give it up.  Wow. 
[02:15:30]  We might have to call this match a draw.  Yeah.  I'm calling it a draw.  She won.  She won.  Wait.  You bitches are crazy.  Call me one.  Jesus Christ.  She totally won that match.  She's a winner.  She's a winner.  She's a winner.  Hey, who won that match?  I don't know.  No, no.  It was a tie.  It was a tie, right?  No, it wasn't, because the first one I won, the second one we drew.  You're saying that we're drawing ever since?  That I won.  We can't be paying attention to a score.  Hey, Anthony, Ari, I won.  You're supposed to throw people around.  Ariana, the winner.  We'll give it to Ariana. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  That looked like our last contract negotiation with Ken Stevens, didn't it?  What does the mom think?  Oh, I'm very proud.  No, this mom.  Ariana.  You thought Ariana won?  The hot mom.  Yeah, the hot mom was getting her pictures taken for the Moms I Like to F contest.  Well, you guys, let's hear it for the Cat Fighters today.  That was awesome.  We got some great video and great snapshots.  We're going to take a break, and we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  One of my favorite guests of all time coming back in. 
[02:16:30]  Dr. Drew.  Heard every weeknight at 11 o'clock right here on WNEW.  Thanks to you guys for 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  We tried to work a little magic here.  We don't carry a lot of clout, but all of a sudden you were here, and the next day you  were on at 11 o'clock.  All you got to do is get my vag involved and things get done.  The Radio Chick, weekdays 9 to noon, 102.7. 
[02:17:00]  WNEW.  Wow, Anthony, Sam Adams.  Oh, yeah.  I love the Sam Adams.  I'd be drinking one if we had some in the fridge in the office.  Unfortunately, we drank all of our Sam Adams supply.  These guys send us about three cases a month, three or four cases, and it's gone.  It's only the second.  We went through four cases in two days.  We got a problem. 
[02:17:30]  At that rate, we're going to need a lot more cases of Sam Adams.  But I did hear tell that they've been delivering some Sam Adams to Ron and Fez.  Oh.  We drank Ron and Fez's, too.  Two days, six cases of Sam Adams.  We definitely need some form of counseling.  Sam Adams, we're going to have to send someone out.  We love it.  We drink it here on the show.  And if you want to declare independence from boring beer without taste, get Sam Adams this 4th of July. 
[02:18:00]  Sam Adams.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  What a day, what a day, what a day, Anthony.  Pat wants in real fast here.  Pat, what's up? 
[02:18:30]  Pat.  Yo, Pat.  Matt.  Matt.  Matt.  What's up?  Not much.  Calling from Cleveland.  Yeah, right on.  For a long time since anything like this has ever been the air.  Got to tell you, it's been the best freaking time in the car that I've ever had.  Look at that.  Just trying to help out on the commute home.  I just, I want to thank you guys.  Made me laugh.  Almost hit a car, but not.  And, uh, like I said, first time I had in the car for a while.  Hey, we got a lot more stuff coming at you, Matt, so thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thanks again, man.  We greatly appreciate it.  Hey, thank you.  All right.  Early support from Cleveland, Anthony.  Jesus.  Listening on extreme radio.  Isn't that great?  We've been on in Chicago for two and a half weeks on one call.  Well, when the hell are we on?  In the middle of the night.  We'll learn them.  Cat fighting rocks.  That was cool to watch, man.  And we got the videos and pictures, and, uh, I hear they're going to be at the road show. 
[02:19:30]  Uh, yeah, we're going to have a cat fighting thing going on at the, uh, road show at the  Stone Pony this Saturday.  Um, the thing about the cat fighting, though, it starts off, they're kind of like, oh, this  is, this will be fun.  By the end of it, they get really down and dirty, serious, and they start getting really  pissed off at each other.  I know, because one of them will do something that, uh, upsets the other one, and the other  one's got to retaliate, and then the other one feels more pissed off, and before you  know it, they're really, uh, ripping at each other.  Right.  Fun.  During the commercials, um, the Fox News crew ran out of here.  They, they've seen enough.  They've seen enough. 
[02:20:00]  The reporter was completely horrified.  You know what the best part is?  Um, they were, they were supposed to be done.  They were going to, they interviewed us before the show.  Right.  And then by four o'clock, they were going to just wrap up.  They got an hour of footage of the show.  That's it.  They stayed until just after six.  Yeah.  So, and the reporter was hiding in a closet, because she didn't want to be in the background  of any of the shots.  I know.  And more camera crews from Fox were showing up, because, uh, we hear rumors that they're  all fans of the show, and, yeah. 
[02:20:30]  And, you know, you hear catfighting on the radio, and you're a camera guy for a TV station,  you can tell your boss, look, man, I gotta, I gotta make sure they get all the shots.  I know.  They have more cameras than a shuttle launch over here.  I swear to God, it was just, and then during commercials, uh, Jeremy, the program director  here, he, uh, he introduces me to this guy, and he's the photographer for Time Magazine.  Did you see that?  Yeah, I saw, I met him.  Oh, you met him?  Yeah.  We're going to be in Time, I think, as early as next week. 
[02:21:00]  He was, he was loving it.  He goes, I have a great idea, because he has to, you know, get a photo of us for the  article.  Mm-hmm.  He goes, how about you guys, uh, wrestle?  I'm like, we're not wrestling.  Eh.  And then he got pissed at me, because I'm like, we're not wrestling.  No, we're not going to wrestle.  And then he's giving me a look, like, no, you guys will just go like this.  He.  How about no?  How about we think of something else?  He's like, no, just into the camera.  He.  How about we just take a picture? 
[02:21:30]  Put it in the magazine, and be done with it.  Be done with it is right.  All right.  Um, should we get the ladies in here to say, you know, say what they have to say and get  their plugs out of the way?  Get their plugs, wrap it up.  Dan's saying that was a huge tease.  Dan.  Yeah.  What's up?  Not much, man.  Um, I just want to say, yo, those girls were a big tease.  Why's that?  Why?  Because, man, like, you didn't ascribe them that much, man, and it's like, we're not 
[02:22:00]  there.  You guys get to see all that stuff.  Yeah.  You know something?  It's still fun.  Yeah.  You got to use your imagination.  And if you want to see it, you can go to the website.  Yeah.  It's not a pay website.  It's, you know, you just go to the NWNEW.com.  Check it out.  Yeah.  And foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Dan, it rocked.  You didn't hear the glunting and the screaming and the, it was unbelievable.  Yeah, that was awesome.  All right.  Me and my buddy are sitting in my car cracking up. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Then it wasn't a waste of time.  You had fun.  No, I didn't want to have one of mine.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  All right.  No problem, man.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Graham.  Graham, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Graham, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Kim, where are you, Kim?  Kim, mom, is out of...  I'm good friends with Kim, and I'm kind of like, you know, disrupted by this.  She dogged us out.  She did a great job.  She was against professionals.  I mean...  Yeah, but come on.  Look how tall she is.  She's like six foot tall, but she did very well.  She's exhausted outside the studio right now. 
[02:23:00]  I can imagine.  I've wrestled with her, like, a little play for it with her a little bit, and she gets  going, but come on.  Right.  I'm a guy.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  Downpour.com.  Go to Downpour.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  This guy getting his plug-in.  Get out of here.  Trev from Connecticut's noticing that that was the first exaggerated car crash call from  Cleveland.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The last call we just got from Cleveland.  We love when people exaggerate and say they almost took out a pole. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  Let's go to Matt.  That old gag.  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show, Matt.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just started listening a week ago.  I'm tired of listening to the news, and I wanted to hear some rock, and I hear the Olsen  Twins song last week.  And a couple of minutes later, I hear the Adult World commercial.  What a combination.  I'm driving home without having a steer.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The universal sound of the boner.  Thank you, Matt.  I think that was a compliment. 
[02:24:00]  I'm not really sure, though.  All right.  Rick, let's get the ladies in here.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's wrap it up.  We'll wrap up the catfighting and let them give their plugs.  God, that melee.  And here they come.  Ariana.  There she is.  Who won the second match.  You did very well, Ariana.  And, of course, melee.  Thank you.  We were hoping to see you topless, but it didn't happen in the second match. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, maybe next time.  And that's Tara.  Tara, yeah.  Back in her sexy clothes.  There are 60 fetish films.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she gave me one of her films, Brawling Babes.  I would have brought one of my crystal films, but I haven't got my talent copy yet.  You ever do the bondage, and I know you can't do the sex and bondage in once,  but you ever do the regular sex pornos?  Um, actually, I just branched off into some more mainstream stuff.  I just did my first hardcore with my husband for Big Top Videos, 
[02:25:00]  and that is called The Case of the Three Screwy Redheads.  He plays a private detective.  A private dick.  Yeah.  A private dick.  Sure.  Sure.  And I'm sure he probes all of your cases.  Yeah.  Yeah, good.  A porno with a story.  I have to have motivation as an actress, you know?  How long from the beginning of the movie till the first money shot?  Uh, maybe five minutes.  Five minutes?  All right.  That's acceptable.  Hey, Tara, can you give us a fake O? 
[02:25:30]  A fake O?  Yeah.  You're an actress.  You're an actress.  My whole body shakes, so it's more of a visual than it is a...  I could give it a try.  Yeah, a little fake O.  You're an actress.  Yeah.  I want to see your acting skills.  I play myself, though.  You're very sexy.  Um, well, I would need some stimulation from...  Oh.  Some motivation from Ariana.  Oh.  All right, they could team up and give us a little fake O.  Yeah, she's a little, uh, acting motivation, Anthony.  This is not really...  Is this going to be a group thing? 
[02:26:00]  Dim the lights a little for the girls, so it's a little better.  It's pretty bright in here.  Ariana.  That's better.  Helping her, uh, relax.  Oh, yeah, okay.  It's the ambiance.  She kind of got, um...  Ooh.  That'll work.  Oh, yeah.  This is just all fake, Anthony.  Even I'm getting turned on.  Geez.  Oh, let me turn off this mic over here.  Okay, um...  Tara?  There you go.  She's just, uh, giving us a demonstration of her acting skills.  Yeah.  Working it up. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  She's a pretty good actress, because that really sounds authentic.  That's good.  Yeah.  There's some real stimulation going on.  Well, just, um...  Okay, yeah.  Wow.  Anthony, there's a demonstration of a little acting. 
[02:27:00]  She was shaking like Michael J. Fox.  Yeah, she was.  Wow.  Look, see?  It was all fake.  Look, she could just talk normally.  Right?  Is that okay?  Yeah, that was excellent.  I can't say it on television, but...  No, on television or radio.  Television, radio.  I've christened the chair.  I got so hot watching those catfights.  Right.  CB, walkie-talkie, nothing can get through like that on any broadcast.  Let me go to Pete.  Pete, what's up?  Yeah, you guys have to give a little more description of what's going on, because you've got new listeners, 
[02:27:30]  and they don't know what's going on in your studio.  Oh, I think we call the fight.  Pete, what's different about the show, though, and the other markets will understand, we explain  as much as we can, and then we have a website where you could go later on at night and check  out the pictures and the video for yourself.  Hey, man.  All right.  This is awesome.  And that's how you fill in the blanks, you know?  You've got to use the imagination.  All right.  Look at this way.  Right now, I'm on the phone.  Yeah.  And my hands are not on the gear.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  Everyone driving with your genitals. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, we should have to pay for that.  Yeah, he's got one of those hands-free phones, Anthony.  That must be what it is.  Of course.  You can't even say J-O.  You can't even say J-O.  I'm sorry.  You can't say that either.  No, you can't say that.  And there's nothing illegal about that, Tara.  Consuelo, what's up?  I have a problem with you all.  I mean, what do you have against black people?  Every time...  Where'd that come from?  What do you mean, where'd it come from?  I mean, you always plan those little things from Blazing Saddles.  I mean, how stupid is that? 
[02:28:30]  Blazing Saddles is a very funny movie.  I don't care if it is funny, but you don't have to disrespect us like that.  We are highly intelligent people.  And what makes you think that you're more intelligent than us?  Who said that?  You never said that, Consuelo.  You're looking too deep into this.  No, no.  We're having trouble.  It's in this, in that.  Who's climbing up in the tree?  I mean, come on.  Who said that?  That is just so ridiculous.  Hold on, Consuelo.  Who said that, Consuelo?  Please, don't even try it.  Consuelo.  No, no, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  No. 
[02:29:00]  Do what he's saying.  That's from Blazing Saddles.  I don't hear you making fun of your people.  Consuelo.  We make fun of our people all the time.  Consuelo, where are you calling from?  Where are you calling from?  We'll discuss this.  In Philadelphia.  Yeah, please.  Like that.  Why?  There's a sound effect from movies and whatnot.  Consuelo, what are you talking about?  Like what?  You better have them stank women up in your place rolling around, and you're going to  disrespect us.  I bet you there's no black women up in there doing that change. 
[02:29:30]  Excuse me while I whip this out.  We have black women up here all the time, Consuelo.  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  I just think it's wrong.  It's just not right.  What's wrong?  You're making it seem like we're ignorant, and we can't spell our names, and we don't  know one plus one.  We never said any of that.  What show are you listening to?  I listen to your show.  I mean, someone told me to listen in, and I listened in one day, and I was like, I  don't believe anyone listens to this crap.  I mean, all you do is talk about black people like we're ignorant. 
[02:30:00]  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  Yeah, very cute.  What?  We didn't even say anything.  What's cute?  Very cute.  What's cute?  Consuelo, were you going to say it?  I don't get it.  You don't have to get it.  You're ignorant.  I guess so.  I guess so.  I don't know.  Hey, don't make fun of me.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  Oh, that's cute, too.  A little Sanford-ness on action.  I'm big dick black.  Very funny. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, you all can't find anything better to do?  You have any other cute ones you want?  Spear checker.  What?  You have anything else cute you want to do?  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, tights, wops, or greasers.  Very nice.  Spear checker.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  You are too much.  Mm-hmm.  Anything else?  Yeah, I challenge I Live You Every Day.  I'm much more intelligent than you, too.  You're, uh, did so.  I did.  Charcoal briquette.  A morning gun.  Goodbye.  I hope you're so wrong. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, please.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make look.  It's not so much that I want to kill her.  It's just I want her not to be alive anymore.  I don't know what she was talking about, Anthony.  Tim, what's up?  Tim.  Where's Tim?  Hey, Tim, what's up, man?  Tim.  Yeah, she's saying you guys are, uh, you know, saying that African-Americans or blacks  are ignorant or whatever.  Only ignorant people are going to get offended by this.  Oh, she listened one day. 
[02:31:30]  She doesn't even really know the show.  I don't know what she was listening to.  Yeah, she's obviously, sorry, I'm at work.  She's obviously ignorant if she's going to get offended by it because it's just a joke.  You got a call coming in.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, man.  Yeah, shut up, you stupid whore.  You don't know what you're talking about.  I don't want to rule.  Wow, Matt.  Wow.  Are you black?  Yeah, I'm black.  I listen all the time.  You had, like, a whole show about this once.  You were talking about Polish people, Chinese people.  Chinese people do suck. 
[02:32:00]  But, like, a whole bunch of different kind of people, you know?  Jesus, man.  All right, Matt, thank you.  Okay, thanks.  Bye.  I don't understand why he had to say that about Chinese people.  Stock that chink a day's pay for napping on the job.  Yes, sir.  Anthony, Antoinella.  Antoinella.  Antoinella.  Antoinella, what's up?  Hello.  Yeah.  Antonella.  Antonella.  Antonella.  Hi.  I called in a few days ago.  I love you guys.  But anyway, um...  What was wrong with Antoinette?  Oh, I don't know.  Why are you, like, putting a few names together here? 
[02:32:30]  My mother made it up.  I don't know.  Antoinella.  There's a book out there with plenty of names to choose from.  Why do you got to make up your own?  Because she's dumb.  I don't know.  All right.  But, um, I always want a lady to shut up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you a fine African princess?  No, I'm white.  Why would you assume that she was...  My God, Opie, you're terrible.  No, because you make fun of white people all the time.  I listen to you, like, every day at work.  Holy S.  Your name is Antoinella, and you're white. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  It's in Italian.  Actually, I'm Sicilian.  Well, okay.  Well, that makes sense.  Close enough.  People think I'm gay.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  They think you're mulatto, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's okay, though.  I mean, I can't call him...  My boyfriend's black, so...  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Your dad must be happy.  He's a Sicilian father.  He's, uh...  He hasn't met him yet.  What?  He hasn't met him yet, so...  Oh, he hasn't met him yet?  And why not, Antoinella?  Uh, but...  Uh...  We have some audio of your father finally meeting him. 
[02:33:30]  You're, uh...  Did so.  Charcoal bricette.  A moulin yarn.  Tony Soprano, everyone.  Me crab.  Me crab?  Me crab.  All right, Antoinella.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  You're a girl.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  My God.  When will people realize we goof on everything in this place?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, him too.  Hey, okay.

[02:39:30]  What did you think of the cat fight?  I forgot your name.  Larry.  Larry, that's right.  I'm sorry, Larry.  I'm a little bit shocked, actually.  I was going to make believe I knew your name and call you Dude or Champ or something.  But I figured, you know what?  I might as well come clean and just say I forgot.  Dude, Champ.  Champ.  Hey, Champ.  Hey, pal.  Don't call me Champ, pal.  I'm not your pal, friend.  All right, buddy.  No, that was disturbing.  Melee, was it?  Melee, yeah.  She's a freak.  She's a 52-year-old freak, sure.  That was just bad.  That was just ugly.  And she needs a shower.  I think I need a shower after watching that. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  The cat fighting was cool, though, right?  Yeah, it was great.  Hey, I just wanted to stop down because you guys are doing such a great job getting the Planet  of Chava stuff out there.  But one thing that's kind of really bothering me about the Tremble, you guys talk about the  Tremble and how much caffeine it is.  Yeah.  And I still hear stuff on the street, like, you know, oh, I drink Red Bull when I go out  and I need to get my energy drinks.  Red Bull is for girls.  I mean, lose the goddamn skirt.  All right.  So if you want to get girls, get Red Bull once.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying you drink the Red Bull and you get the girls.  I'm just saying, people say, oh, yeah, this has so much caffeine. 
[02:40:30]  Tremble kicks its ass.  Yeah, Tremble has an insane, insane amount of caffeine.  Tremble's great and you could smoke it in a crack pipe and it really gets you going.  Well, you know, you mix it with a little 151 and you call it a cyclone.  That's what the college kids are doing.  With the Tremble?  Yeah.  Nice.  Or a man's speedball.  Yeah.  Well, you know who else is doing that?  Tremble is our parents.  Yeah.  The moms, you know, they come up to the tasting booth and they're like, give me the Tremble.  I'm like, no, the shrink was designed for college kids.  Right.  And they're like, no way, I've got to chase up these goddamn brats and they're all over it. 
[02:41:00]  Right on.  I'm just saying, lose the skirt, drink the Tremble.  All right.  Thank you.  Larry from Planet Java.  There he goes.  Now it's time to play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show, Ant?  Very educational.  Let's go right to the phones and start with Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, I'm from camp.  Hey.  I learned that Opie can count the taint on an old boy, like the 200-year-old red oak.  Opie, again, guessing Malin's age merely by looking at her taint.  Thank you.  I really didn't want to show off my skills today, but Anthony forced me and payback is a bitch. 
[02:41:30]  Me, crab.  That's right.  Let's go to John.  John, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned Dalwin A are worse than Alien Ant Farm.  Yeah, we learned that.  Yeah, how's that work out?  Very good, man.  All right, that flew us.  All right, thank you.  Dan writes, I learned that $2 is a fair price to charge for seeing a horse die on the backstretch.  Yep.  And that horse's name?  Jack Lemmon.  Dave, what's going on?  How you guys doing?  Pretty good.  All right, I learned two things today.  Yeah.  First, another name for an African-American is a charcoal briquette. 
[02:42:00]  Oh.  And secondly...  Only funny when Tony Soprano says it, my friend.  And secondly, white women can have a black name as long as they're Sicilian.  All right, thank you.  You guys are great, thanks.  All right, bye.  See, we use characters.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I learned today that melee's paint smells like Trenton.  Like Trenton?  Yeah.  Very right.  Very good.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[02:42:30]  Today, I learned that melee's intimates look like someone took a wand and broil, put it  in a dryer, ran it through a cycle, then emptied the wind trap.  Wow.  You paid attention.  Have a good day.  I had to write that down.  It was way too long.  That's good, though.  Enjoy your day off, fellas.  Hey, thanks, man.  He's prepared.  The show will still be on the air tomorrow with some really, really good stuff to get  the other markets caught up in.  Mike writes, today I learned that keep the cops ass is still just as disturbing 24 hours  after the first time you see it.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned air guitar is passe. 
[02:43:00]  Al Mack, today I learned that O&A are extreme retards and they're worse than Alien Ant Farm.  Look at John from Brooklyn.  He learned any W van needs new wipers.  Where else are you going to learn that?  But right here from Earl.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey.  I learned more affiliates equals no more C blocking.  That's right.  And if Earl quit, N.E.W. would be down a shoogee.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, man.  Me crap.

Listen, I learned two things today.  Yeah.  Number one, hot moms can make great dominatrixes.  Nice.  And number two, I've got to tell my wife I'm working Saturday because I've got to make it to this road show down in Jersey.  Yes, you do.  At the Stone Pony.  I'm going to have to hear about their t-shirt contest, man.  I'm there.  Yeah, Stone Pony.  Thank you, man.

Also, catfighting will be happening at the road show at the Stone Pony this Saturday.  Yes, catfighting.  I'm going to love it.  Let me go to Tony and see what he learned.  Tony, what did you learn on the show today?  Two quickies.  I learned the new hairstyle, Donahue and a headlock.  Uh-huh.  And I learned Tara is one hell of an actress.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Home run, boys.  Very good.  First day for Columbus.  I think we just spoiled it.  Warren learned that there's a Paul in every city.  Just give it time.  Oh, hey, that's really good.  Yeah.  Paying attention.  Uh, someone from somewhere, I learned that One will wrestle for an XFL football, but won't  wrestle for Time Magazine.  Jersey Gary, I learned on the show today how to make everything okay.  Uh, sleep next to the pods.  Sleep next to the pods.  And Opie's new nickname is the Amazing Taint. 
[02:45:00]  Ray writes, today I learned what a white tiger looks like when it falls on a chainsaw.  It was a snow leopard, but we'll let him slide.  Anthony, our final qualifier for the moms, I'd like the F contest, are now up on WNEW.com.  What's her name again?  Her name is Neo.  She's going by Neo.  Neo, okay.  And I learned that a stay-at-home mom, none more hotter.  Look at this lady.  Look. 
[02:45:30]  Winner.  Wow.  Winner.  Look at Stinky come running in.  Stinky was cheering me when I was posing her.  Wow.  Wow.  Kazowie.  That's the last girl to qualify for the contest.

Um, is she laying on the wrestling mat?  Of course she is.  Little advantage for her there. 
[02:46:00]  And Rick.  Yes.  Did you ask her to pull the bra straps off of her shoulders like that?  I didn't ask her.  I did it for her.  Oh, look at you.  Helping out the show.  Wow.  That works.  It's very functional for this contest.  I thought it was...  You know, I'm published.  I gotta keep the reputation.  Rick.  Yeah.  Did you pull down her skirt also exposing her ass crack in that shot?  That her bra straps her off the shoulders? 
[02:46:30]  I may have suggested one or two things she do to enhance her look.  Sure.  Okay.  Very nice.  Yeah, I know.  We have a minute left in the show.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that if you want to get your point across, you should call the comment line multiple  times reminding them who you are.  Yeah.  And every call from a new city sounds like an old Farley bit.  You know that afternoon show?  Yeah.  They suck.  All right.  Stinky rolls, guys.  All right.  Cool.  Stinky rolls.  I look forward to playing more complaint calls tomorrow, Thursday on the show.  Yeah.  Pete, what's up?  Yeah, I learned today that all black women like to blame everything on the white guy. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  And that ain't fair.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  How does this turn into such a racially heated program sometimes?  Anthony, we got to go.  We're going to take tomorrow off, but the show will be on the air with some really, really  good stuff, especially for the new markets.  It is Whip'em Out Wednesday, so really fast.  Make sure you get a homemade wow sign on your car.  If the ladies feel like it, they will be flashing you on the highways all day tomorrow.  Holiday wow.  The new market's going to take a little time, but trust me on this one.  It works like a charm, okay? 
[02:47:30]  Mm-hmm.  Wow stickers or wow signs on your car, homemade ones, and see what happens.  And Mele's peach smells like Luca Brasi's vest.  Very nice.  With that, thank you.  Opie.  Wow.

They're going to be like, wow, those guys are like the greatest radio show ever.  And then, like Thursday, we're going to suck really bad.  We'll give them one of those really crappy shows that New York is so familiar with.  You guys know the shows we're talking about.  They're going to be like, what happened?  Where's that show I was listening to Tuesday?  Right.  Because this show sucks.

I know.  The guy who fired us in Boston, who was the Terminator, who actually fired us, just gave  his approval to hire the Opie and Anthony show for a radio station in syndication.  Nice.  You learned, you bastard.  Details coming on that.  Earl?  Yes.  Why, why, why?  Why slam the door?  Earl, those doors are like five grand apiece, man. 
[02:55:30]  You'd be working here for about 362,000 years to pay it off.  Why did you slam the door?  What's bothering you today?  Why are you upset?  Because I warned everyone that the copy was long.  I said it was long.  It's okay.  I understood it was long.  I said it wasn't your fault.  I acknowledged it was long.  I said it wasn't your fault.  I was just, you know, a little frustrated.  Be careful in the future.  Yeah, it's the year 2058.  I'm still paying for that door.  The hinge done snapped. 
[02:56:00]  Earl, I understand it was long.  I wasn't blaming you.  Yeah, it was just long copy.  Or actually not even copy.  It was a contest folder.  It was a contest folder.  You all right?  I'm fine.  You all right, man?  Yes.  Want a beer or something?  No.  Want a little, you know.  Cool.  What the hell is that?  Huh?  Want a little pot?  No.  Some H?  No.  No?  Want a hug?  No.
