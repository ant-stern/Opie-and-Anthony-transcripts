<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a replay of a caller, Andrew from Brooklyn, whose heavily slurred pronunciation of "Space Shuttle Endeavor" as "Space Show Endeavor" became a running joke.  This was followed by "Is Tom Alive Friday?", a segment focusing on a terminally ill listener, Tom, who was contemplating suicide.  Tom's chest x-rays were displayed and discussed, with a medical student caller offering an opinion on his condition.  A listener death pool concerning Tom's survival was also mentioned.  The hosts then launched into a scathing critique of the movie *Daddy Day Camp*, mocking its predictable plot and clich√©s.  This was followed by listener calls, including one from a woman detailing her unpleasant experience losing her virginity at summer camp at age 13, and another from a woman with ornithophobia, whose increasingly bizarre anecdotes about birds and the hosts' cruelly humorous "cures" for her phobia provided comedic relief.  The segment concluded with a call from Tom confirming he was still alive.

The show continued with a segment featuring Andrea, another caller with an extreme fear of birds.  Maury, dressed as Big Bird, was present in the studio to confront her phobia, resulting in Andrea's distress. The hosts added to the comedic effect with suggestions for escalating the bird-related "treatment" with owls, strobe lights, worms, and funnel cakes.  Further caller segments followed, including questions about Flakka Seagull's "Iran" and a listener's anecdote about being pooped on by birds twenty times.  E-Rod was teased for drinking Nesquik, sparking a discussion about his diet, alongside mentions of Point and Laugh Friday and the pink flamingo prop in the studio.  Tom from White Plains called again, detailing his severe lung disease, broken back (from a car accident that later delivered his pizza), lesions on his spinal cord, and loss of feeling in his legs and hands.  He reiterated his plan to end his life if his condition worsened.  The hosts responded with a mixture of dark humor and concern, and listeners called in to offer support and suggestions.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of Anthony's upcoming trip to the Renaissance Festival, featuring comedic banter about the event and its attendees.  This transitioned into a promotion for the return of "What the Hell Is That?", a segment showcasing unusual medical oddities.  More discussion of Tom's health followed.  A humorous song about Dungeons & Dragons preceded further promotion of "What the Hell Is That?", along with the announcement of "Tom Alive Friday," "Boy and I Laugh Friday," "Mispronunciation Friday," "Air Guitar Friday," and the return of the "F.U. Line."  Audio clips from Maury Povich's show were played, specifically focusing on a woman terrified of cotton balls, which the hosts discussed using highly offensive language. A call from Rob in Brooklyn delivered an "F.U." to Anthony. Kid Rock's "So Hot" was played and reviewed.

A major segment involved a heated exchange between Opie and Anthony and Adam Carolla, accusing Carolla of hypocrisy and dishonesty regarding his relationship with Howard Stern and his comments about Opie and Anthony.  Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio during this segment.  Similar accusations were leveled against Man Cow, another radio personality, with the hosts using highly offensive language ("douche," "cunt," "asshole") throughout this extended segment. They mocked Man Cow's perceived limited reach and audience, describing the characteristics of the small towns where he allegedly broadcast.  Listener emails and a call about Man Cow's horror movie, "The Sixth Floor," further fueled the hosts' mockery. The segment ended abruptly, likely due to a commercial break, with the hosts continuing their verbal assault on Man Cow.  A final promotional segment was briefly mentioned.  Throughout the show, a consistent thread of dark humor, often bordering on offensive, was present in the hosts' commentary and interactions with callers.

There's people listening right now going, what the hell are they talking about?  Friday edition.  The Spice Shuttle and Devil.  It really made me laugh all day yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  It was out of his mind.  And some people get it and others are like, what's wrong with you guys?  Dude, why did you play that?  It's always fun to point out someone's speech impediment and then exploit the hell out of it and make them say it over and over again.  We had this guy from Brooklyn, it was Fun Fact Thursday, and he had a fun fact about space shuttles.  His fact was not nearly as fun as the way he sounded like a retard. 
[00:03:00]  Do you want to play that from yesterday right off the bat?  It's Fun Fact 2.  It's Fun Fact 2.  I want to hear him say that.  All right.  Wacky voice.

You know, the Space Show Endeavor, you know, the part that the, the Space Show Endeavor was actually, was actually built. 
[00:03:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The what?  Space Show Endeavor.  The, uh.  The Space Show Endeavor.  All right, wait.  It's, uh, hold on.  There's something wrong with the phones.  Uh, Andrew, right?  Yes.  All right.  Andrew from Brooklyn?  Yes.  Okay, you're on the air.  What's up?  Um, Space Show Endeavor.  Um, that space, that spacecraft was actually built to replace the Challenger.  And the, something about the Challenger.  Andy. 
[00:04:00]  I can't hear him.  What, what, you can't hear him either?  No, please.  What ship, uh, was built for, to replace it?  I said, Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  Challenger.  We're back live.  Space Show Endeavor.  We're just getting warmed up with this guy.  We just want to jump in for a second here.  Space Show Endeavor.  That is hysterical.  What's, what was wrong with him? 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  I love that he's gotten into his story.  Maybe he'll call back today.  It, it continued with this.  Uh, you're going to have to start over.  Sorry.  Start over.  Sorry, Andrew.  Go ahead.  This sounds really interesting.  Um, the Space Show Endeavor, the part, the shuttle that replaced Challenger Endeavor was actually built with spare parts from the shuttle's Discovery and Atlantis.  They were left over when they were finished built.  From, from what?  When they finished building both.  The Atlantis? 
[00:05:00]  No, I said, Space Show Endeavor.  It's spare parts.  I mean, the parts that were used to build it.  Excuse me.  The, um, the parts that they used to build the Space Show Endeavor came from.  I said it again.  The parts that they used to build the Space Show Endeavor.  And then he goes, excuse me.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Like we're interrupting him.  Hey, sorry. 
[00:05:30]  I had finished.  The Space Show Endeavor.  The Space Show Endeavor.  Oh, that was great.  And, uh, it ended with this.  Here we go.  A little more of Andrew from Brooklyn.  Yeah, sum it up.  So, uh, the, the, the what replaced the what with the what?  Endeavor replaced Challenger.  Wait, what's Endeavor?  Space Show Endeavor.  Right.  And the material that they used to build Space Show Endeavor. 
[00:06:00]  We're wrestlers from, um, from, um, from Discovery and Atlantis.  Oh, God.  Wow.  So the Space, uh, Shuttle and, and, what did he say?  Endeavor?  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  What is it?  Special Endeavor.  What is it again?  Say it.  You've got to be clear, dude, and say it loud.  Yeah.  Space Shuttle Endeavor. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that, uh, you mush mouth.  We all, uh, we all learned something from Andrew in Brooklyn.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Andrew.  And that's how we begin today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-DA.  There's just something about that that makes me laugh really hard.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm talking about the Space Show Endeavor.  Special, special Endeavor. 
[00:07:00]  He just gets stuck at the end of the word.  Yeah.  Never.  Rrrr.  The Challenger.  The Challenger.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  All right.  It's Point and Laugh Friday.  We point and laugh at Andrew today.  He's point and laughable.  Also, it's FU Friday.  If something pissed you off this week, you give us a call on that one.  It's Mispronunciation Friday.  Ah.  It's Air Guitar Friday.  Which no one ever does.  And here's the big get. 
[00:07:30]  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Oh, yeah.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  What is that?  I knew there was something Friday I looked forward to.  This is the big get for today.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  What is that again?  And right off the bat, people are like, Tom Chiasano?  No, not Tom Chiasano.  Some guy from White Plains.  Oh, very good.  I think he's from White Plains, and he's got this horrific lung disease that's affecting  both his lungs. 
[00:08:00]  It's affecting his heart.  I guess the doctors gave him seven years.  He's up to six years already.  It's up to six years of his seven that the doctors said he had left.  And he said he's not going to go out, you know, in a hospital, wheezing out of his little  parrot lungs.  When push comes to shove, he's going to blow his brains out.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a gun, and he's going to use it.  And he's going to just...  He's going to control his own death.  Blow his brains out because he doesn't want to go out like that. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Do you guys call him, or does he call you?  Well, that's the beauty of the bit.  He calls us, so we don't have his phone number, so this is the beauty of the whole thing.  One day, one Friday, because it's a Friday thing, we're going to go from six to nine without  a call from Tom, and we're going to just have to assume that he's dead.  He's just going to have to assume the worst.  He's just going to have to assume he's dead.  Imagine he just had a late night, and maybe he's a little sick, and he had to take a little  Tylenol PM or something, and he overslept. 
[00:09:00]  He had one of his many doctor's appointments or something.  Yeah.  We just know this is going to end with Anthony and I going to a wake, and...  I will not go to a wake for this guy.  You won't go?  Why would I go?  And saying something nice like, in the short time that we knew Tom, he gave us all laughter.  He's a very good, very brave young man.  Well, part of this program.  And the weird thing is, the listeners are doing a death pool. 
[00:09:30]  There's money involved.  I swear to God, this thing has taken on a life of its own.  I think frunkus.net or frunkus.com, and I believe Wackbag is starting to get involved  with this.  Yeah.  It's just awful for everybody involved now.  It started out as a cute little thing, but it's kind of taken on a life of its own.  And if Frank could put a bed in and just blow his brains out exactly at that time, exactly  on that day, and make his daughter a billion dollars.  Well, last week we asked Tom to send in an x-ray. 
[00:10:00]  Is Tom alive?  Tom's chest x-rays.  Oh, right.  And they're up on the website, our website.  But I don't know what I'm looking at.  It kind of looks...  Let's see.  That's pretty dark, dude.  Is dark good or bad when you're looking at a lung x-ray?  Let me take a look.  Wait, you know something about lung x-rays?  Okay.  See, the darkness is not good, but see all this white stuff in there branching off?  Yeah.  Very bad.  What?  Very bad. 
[00:10:30]  Isn't that his ribs?  That's like scar tissue.  No.  No.  All the white spider web looking things.  Right.  Oh.  Wait, so a dark lung x-ray is not good?  No.  You want what?  Puffy white?  Yeah.  In your lung x-ray?  Yeah.  Well, it looks like only one of his lungs has about...  You can't even call it a quarter.  I would call it a sixth.  He's got like a quarter of a lung capacity.  In one lung.  And then he's got all these little problems with... 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, see all that white spider web-y looking stuff in there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's bad.  So, you know how to read chest x-rays?  No, I just know what a good one looks like.  It's conducted to the same thing.  You see all that white spider stuff there, my friend?  White spider stuff?  That's bad.  Yeah, the spider stuff is bad.  So, what do you want in a chest x-ray?  You want just clear, nice, white, cloudy...  Nice, white lungs.  Lungs.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  That's like nice and clear.  See, I was thinking he wasn't that bad because I thought black meant good in an x-ray.  No, no.  Black, never good.  Never good in an x-ray.  Black in x-rays, never good.  You shouldn't have any black in you.  Well, I guess for the doubters out there...  Well...  That goes with neighbors.  Let's...  Sorry.  I guess for the doubters out there, if you think this Is Tom Alive thing is kind of a  joke, it's really not.  If you look at that x-ray up on the website.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll hopefully hear from Tom today. 
[00:12:00]  Is Tom Alive Friday is in effect.  Wow.  He is in bad shape.  That's...  It's like a quarter of his lung is working.  Al Dukes is pointing out...  Could you go back to the x-ray?  Al Dukes.  Dr. Dukes is checking in.  Al Dukes, who runs the...  Dr. Al Dukes.  Al Dukes, who runs the dump button down the hall and also does the fine show rundowns for  92.3krock.com, if you go to the O.P. and Anthony page, he writes, notice there's an ad for  porn right above poor Tom's chest x-ray. 
[00:12:30]  Where's the porn in?  Where's the porn?  Is it right below Tom's chest x-ray?  Tom's sharing with us and there's a porn ad.  It just says, buy your mommy something nice.  That can't be a porn ad, is it?  For a hardcore superstore.  Oh, what does it say?  Oh.  Hardcore superstore.  Buy your mommy something nice.  That's right above, is Tom alive, Tom's chest x-ray.  That's nice.  I guess we just put up this x-ray for today's show, so you can check out what's going on 
[00:13:00]  with his chest.  So this guy's going to be dead someday.  Someday.  He's just going to...  He's blowing his brain down.  Some minute.  Well, this sick F, he calls up.  He does have a great sense of humor.  He's a huge fan of the show.  He called up and did a rock screen for us and ran out of air.  He's just...  He's a trooper when it comes to Is Tom Alive Friday.  But there you go.  There's a porn ad above the chest x-ray. 
[00:13:30]  You should see if he can break the world record of holding your breath underwater.  That was accomplished yesterday on Regis, of all people.  It can't be an official record if you do it on Regis' show, I don't think.  Regis.  They were talking about it on the news this morning.  Oh, they were?  Yeah.  I saw that on the news.  They were making a big to-do about it.  Apparently, it's record-breaking week on Regis.  He does that every year, the Guinness Book of World Records thing.  They're going to break some records!  Yeah.  But Regis could care less. 
[00:14:00]  He's outside that oversized fish tank with this dude in it.  That's looking like a mannequin for 15 straight minutes, and Regis is just staring.  He doesn't care.  He's just happy to be alive at this point with all the problems he's had.  All right.  What else is going on today?  We got Is Tom Alive Friday?  That's the big get.  Can't wait to see that.  And a huge distraction for everybody.  By the way, he hasn't called yet.  Not good.  The beauty of this bit, as soon as he calls, we get him on so everyone can breathe.  Except him. 
[00:14:30]  Except him.  Poor guy.  How ironic.  And, you know, it's Friday, so a lot of people are going to be heading toward the old movie theater.  Well.  There's no real movies that are being released today.  The big one is next week, Superbad, that we're all behind.  That's a week still?  We had Jonah Hill on the show yesterday.  He was absolutely hilarious.  Part of the interview is on YouTube already.  Sam put the video up, so if you want to check it out, just type in Opie and Anthony Superbad, and you can see Jonah Hill. 
[00:15:00]  Well, I don't care about that.  When does Daddy Day Camp come out?  Oh, I think it's today!  All right.  That's Cuba.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is just knocking off fantastic film after fantastic film.  And his latest film, Daddy Day Camp, just looks hysterical.  Just from the poster.  Just from the movie poster where he's laying down on the ground, clawing at the ground, making a, oh no face, as children drag him into a tent or something. 
[00:15:30]  And they're all celebrating and cheering behind him, little kids.  The poster alone makes me want to shoot Cuba Gooding Jr.  There it is.  I was trying to defend him yesterday, but oh wow, look at that poster.  Yeah.  Is that, that's going to be one of those that if I ever saw it in a video store, if I ever went into video stores anymore, 
[00:16:00]  I would stare at that for about 15 minutes to a half hour, getting angry.  He's one of those guys that completely lucked out in Hollywood because his first movie, for the most part, was a massive hit.  Oscar winner.  Oscar winner.  That gave him, that gave him years in Hollywood to make bombs.  Years.  Because we were talking yesterday, I can't even think of a second Cuba Gooding movie that I enjoyed.  The one with the dogs.  Oh, that snow thing.  What was it called? 
[00:16:30]  Snow dogs.  Snow dogs.  Yeah, that was terrific.  Come on.  That was terrific.  Fantastic.  What about the one where he was on that gay cruise, but he was straight.  Oh, right.  What was that called?  Wow.  He wasn't gay.  He was straight.  That was the whole funny part about it.  And he was on a gay cruise.  You get it?  Yeah.  But how did he get on the gay cruise ship?  I think it was a mix-up.  A little mix-up?  He brought his buddy.  No, they wanted a scoop.  There was some girls going.  So they wanted to be the only ones.  Or something like that.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah, so they get on, and it's all about them having a man-on-man sex. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The hijinks ensued.  Hey, he was in Rat Race, though.  Come on.  Rat Race?  He was in Radio.  Come on.  He was on Home...  Oh, he played...  Well, see, that one he thought was going to be his big Oscar winner again.  Yeah.  Radio, where you play a retard.  Yeah.  And you instantly win an Oscar.  But I guess not.  What won in 2003?  What won the Oscar in 2003 that stole it away from... 
[00:17:30]  Let's find out.  Cuba Gooding Jr.  Hey, this guy is disagreeing with you as far as Tom's X-ray goes.  Really?  Adam in Jersey, what's up?  All right.  Yeah.  Hey.  O&A, what's up?  What's going on, buddy?  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Please don't ever read my chest X-ray.  Why?  What's the problem?  Black is good.  In this situation, black is good on X-ray.  Oh, what did I say?  I was a doctor?  I have a microphone.  I could lie into it.  What do I know?  Is Adam a doctor?  I'm a medical student. 
[00:18:00]  What does the black mean?  Black means there's air.  There's nothing that stopped the X-ray, absorbed it, so it just penetrates right through.  Oh!  We got that part.  All right.  So we could breathe a little sigh of relief today.  Oh, I thought it was bad.  What about...  Yeah, but he has this white spidey thing in one of his lungs that's pretty impressive.  That's really bad.  And then the other lung is about one-sixth white.  Not good. 
[00:18:30]  Not good.  Hey, dude, what about when they show smokers' lungs in an X-ray and they look all black?  Yeah, that's because emphysema just stretches them out real big.  Lots of air in there.  They trap air.  So that's not good either.  But in his case, you want to see black.  It means that there's lots of air in there.  All right.  But there's still some kind of...  Don't read in my X-ray.  There's still some kind of crazy spider-looking thing happening that's taking up a nice portion 
[00:19:00]  of one of his lungs.  Yeah, that sounds like the disease.  Like sarcoid.  All right.  Oh, sarcoid.  Sarcoid.  That's a villain from the new Spider-Man movie.  I wonder how many...  Sarcoid.  Yeah, sarcoid.  I have no idea.  Sorry.  I have a mic.  I can say whatever I want.  People will believe me.  I wonder how many people are tuning in on Fridays just to see if Tom's alive at this point.  I'm hoping Tom's alive.  Yeah, so far, no call.  I think last week he called real early and let us off the hook. 
[00:19:30]  So we'll see what happens today.  All right.  Cuba Gooding Jr. was in Norbit.  He was in Norbit.  Wow.  Small part in Norbit.  Of course, he was in Pearl Harbor.  So, you know.  Yeah.  So he's been in two good movies out of like, I don't know, his IMDb goes and goes and goes  and goes and goes and goes and goes.  Wow.  This guy was allowed to make a lot of movies after Jerry Maguire.  Well, he had Boys in the Hoods he was created.  Oh, as good as it gets he was in too.  He was in the Gladiator that wasn't Gladiator. 
[00:20:00]  What do you mean?  In 1992, there was a movie Gladiator.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But it wasn't the Gladiator?  No.  Oh, wow.  Isn't that great when they put movies out?  Like, didn't a movie Titanic come out?  Like, pretty much the same year.  Yeah.  Titanic came out.  You know, the huge movie Titanic.  And then this crappy version came out.  I think with Titanic, there was like a lame TV version that just so happened to hit the  same time the big movie hit that they spent years and like basically billions of dollars 
[00:20:30]  on it.  To make and build sets for and everything.  And then this TV crap.  If you got the lame TNT version at the same time.  You'll be stunned at Marky Post in Titanic.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  We got the Cuba Gooding Daddy Daycare or Daddy Day Camp Trail or whatever.  Oh, I want to hear some of this. 
[00:21:00]  Buckle in.  Buckle in.  We'll do it next.  Bob Kelly here as well.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  8-6-6-WOW-1-WOW.  8-6-6-WOW-1-WOW.  Cell phone and PDA users send your message to feedback at opieandanthony.com.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  Good morning. 
[00:21:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  And it.  Rocking you early.  That's right.  Let's not forget, Is Tom Alive?  Friday.  Every Friday we check to see if Tom's alive.  Hopefully he'll call soon so we can move on to other things.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  We were talking about Daddy Day Camp hitting theaters today, right?  It's getting awful reviews.  Horrendous reviews. 
[00:22:00]  What did Rotten Tomatoes give it?  2% good reviews.  And the one good review we read wasn't really a good review.  What did it say?  Something like, uh...  It said, what do you expect from this?  They gave it a good review because you were supposed to have low expectations to begin with.  It wasn't even a good review.  It was kind of like, look, it's crap.  We know it's crap.  So why would we give it a bad review?  It's great at being crap. 
[00:22:30]  Right, right.  That was the good review.  You want to listen to the trailer?  Yeah.  This is what's sad about America, though.  It is so obvious this movie blows.  Right.  You watch.  It'll be probably number one at the box office this weekend.  Oh, of course.  Probably number one, maybe number two at the box office this weekend.  Because we're a bunch of lemmings.  We see the commercials.  Must see.  Oh, it looks so funny.  And it's the people we've talked about before where you're sitting in the movie theater  and this trailer comes on and then the trailer ends and you hear people going, 
[00:23:00]  oh, that looks good.  Oh, I got to see that.  Oh, that's funny.  And you want to punch them in the face and go, no, it's not.  It's not funny.  Stop it.  And a lot of people go see it because it has kids in it.  So you got the parents.  They're like, ah, I'll bring my kids to see Daddy Day Camp.  Non-threatening black guy.  I can deal with it.  The kids can deal with it.  You know, it's just a dumb formula to get people in the seats this weekend.  And this is everything that is wrong with a movie and with movie trailers. 
[00:23:30]  Just listen to how they try to hype this garbage up.  Raise your hand when you want this to stop so we could, like, analyze it a little bit.  For four years, they've been the daddies of daycare.  I can't believe our sons are seven.  I'm going to spend as much time with Ben as possible.  But now, they're taking everything they've learned.  The daddy daycare brand means a lot.  Repurposing that brand in the summer is just far business. 
[00:24:00]  But you hate the outdoors.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  There's the conflict, everybody.  He hates the outdoors.  He hates the outdoors.  I bet there's going to be some crazy outdoor things happening.  And it's a day camp.  So, they're in the woods or something or outdoors.  And, oh, boy.  Who wants to guess there's going to be an altercation with a bear?  Hijinks ensue.  There's going to be a beehive in this movie.  Oh, I bet.  I bet you.  Oh, the kids love beehive humor. 
[00:24:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  But you hate the outdoors.  This is what you're going to see.  Something with a bear, something with bees, and something with poison ivy.  Ah, the poison ivy one.  The poison ivy scene.  They'll have a bunch of makeup on him where he's all swollen.  And he comes in.  The kids scream.  And he goes, what?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, this is horrible.  It'll be interesting to see how he gets into the poison ivy hijinks in this movie.  The only way this works is if the day camp is Camp Crystal Lake. 
[00:25:00]  All right, ready for the next part?  Kill them.  Kill them, mommy.  I wish Hollywood had a real sense of humor.  Yeah.  Where they would just trick everyone to go see a movie like Daddy Day Camp.  And then it's a slasher film.  Just like the most grotesque slasher film.  But it wasn't in any of the trails.  The trails were like, and the kids are having a great time.  No, they send this version to all the movie reviewers. 
[00:25:30]  And this is the one everyone previews.  So it's out there.  It's a nice movie for families.  And then they switch the film.  Oh, just some serial killer tearing the children in half with his bare hands.  Everybody's eating cereal, and then one of the kids is just decapitating.  And blood is squirting in their Cheerios.  Just crying kids in the movie.  I just wish Hollywood wasn't so predictable.  That would be hilarious.  All right, let's continue. 
[00:26:00]  You know, and it has to be some kind of director or producer that is at the end of their career.  They have nothing to lose.  This is the way I want to go out.  Here I go.  I'm going out on top.  Watch me.  Watch this.  But this movie is so bad because this is actually a sequel to a crappy movie.  It's a sequel to a crappy movie where the actual stars of that crappy movie didn't want to do this one.  So they just recast the same characters.  Yeah.  So it's Cuba Gooding Jr. instead of Eddie Murphy. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, let's go to Nick in Montana.  He wants to help us out today.  Nick, go ahead.  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  Listen, there's also going to be this scene where there's a little forest creature, like a squirrel or something, who jumps on somebody's back and he runs around screaming.  Of course.  But they make friends at the end of the movie.  Well, but the animals get me on a person.  That person's not going to know the animals on him at first.  Yeah.  So he's turning around and everyone else is screaming and he doesn't know why yet. 
[00:27:00]  And then he realizes and then he has to run around like a lunatic.  Or maybe one of the kids will be afraid of the squirrel and he's going to teach him.  It's like, no, no, come here, come here, come here.  And he'll go to pet it and the squirrel will jump on his face and just start clawing him and he'll run around in and out of frame.  Back and forth.  They're also going to actually have to have some type of like, you know, games against the other camp of all blonde, really good looking white kids.  Right. 
[00:27:30]  Superhuman campsters.  And they'll realize that through teamwork and camaraderie that they can beat them.  But the squirrel helps them win right at the end.  Of course.  And of course, it's going to have to be a scene.  It's going to be nighttime and everyone's bedded down for the night.  And then you're going to hear like a wolf or something in the background.  And then it's going to cut to a scene where everyone ended up sleeping together in one room.  Well.  All in a panic.  Well.  In Cuba Gooding Jr.'s bed. 
[00:28:00]  In his sleeping bag.  And then dateline begins.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Of course, there's going to be a wacky outhouse scene exploding.  You know, and also, don't forget the spooky campfire scene.  Oh, where they tell ghost stories and something will happen.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah.  Oh, he was trying to get you.  All right.  Here we go.  Bob Sly.  To a more natural setting.  There it is. 
[00:28:30]  Camp that way.  We were here when we were kids.  We don't know how to run a camp.  Yes, but we didn't know how to run a daycare center either.  What could possibly go wrong?  From the studio that brought you daddy daycare.  This is it.  Time to give them a summer they'll never forget.  From the studio that brought you daddy daycare?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they can't even, like, it's not a producer, director, the stars, nothing.  Okay, look, it's the same building from the building that brought you daddy daycare. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, because the producer of daddy daycare and the director, they don't want their names  associated anymore with this crap.  From the studio.  From the same piece of real estate that brought you daddy daycare.  From the same camera that was used to film daddy daycare.  They had to just say a building.  It's pretty much the building that brought you. 
[00:29:30]  From the same set.  We're going to film this the same month that daddy daycare was filming.  They won't forget that.  It's August.  We're going to show them the adventure.  Charlie and Phil style.  They'll discover the excitement of camp and the importance of family.  And the importance of family. 
[00:30:00]  Every movie has to have some kind of message.  Well, this will have a nice, tender, sweet message that people can walk away from and go,  wow, you know, that really sucked.  This has nothing going to happen that's going to make you think this movie doesn't suck.  Nobody's going to relate to this movie.  Just the dad who really wants to spend time with you.  He took the summer off.  Watch the numbers on Monday morning, man.  We'll be here for you. 
[00:30:30]  We'll discuss this dumb movie.  You guys just need to be yourselves.  And know that you're going to be winners no matter what.  Yeah.  Cuba Gooding Jr.  I guess we showed them.  Daddy day camp.  What did it go wrong?  No, no, no, no.  Please, don't say that.  I think we're going to need more toilet paper. 
[00:31:00]  There's your outhouse scene.  That's your wacky outhouse scene.  It blows up, so there's everywhere.  We should all go and take all the pests and ruin it.  Just a bunch of kids and just boo at every scene.  Surprise ending.  The kids go to the camp driftwood showers and are gassed.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Let's go to Scott on Long Island.  People have no heart.  No.  Scott, what's up? 
[00:31:30]  I saw the trailer.  It reminded me of the great outdoors with Dan Aykroyd and John Candy.  Yeah.  Back scene and the water ski scene.  You're going to see the same kind of thing.  What are you making, cake icing?  Can I lick the beaters?  Let's go to Frank in Philly listening on WISP.  I hear WISP has a new program director.  Ah.  They're heading in the right direction now down there in Philly.  Let's say hi to Frank.  What's up?  Good morning, fellas.  Love you. 
[00:32:00]  Love your show.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I just want to say there's also going to be something's going to catch on fire, either  the tent or the car, and everybody's going to go crazy.  Just run around and not know what to do.  Hopefully it's one of the kids.  They're going to go crazy.  One of the kids are on fire.  All right.  Thank you.  I predict this on video in a month.  All right.  I got to tell you what happens on this show sometimes.  There's somebody on hold.  It says, I lost my virginity in summer camp. 
[00:32:30]  This could be either really good or really bad.  Here's the problem.  I don't know if this is a male or a female.  Yeah.  Let's hope for the best here.  Hello.  Who's this?  Hi.  This is Amy.  Oh, yeah.  And the voice.  Let's check.  All right.  Wait.  Hold on.  All right.  We're getting there.  Yeah.  This is hot.  You can tell.  You remember me? 
[00:33:00]  No.  Uh-oh.  What?  We're just happy that you're a female.  Oh.  We remember.  Uh-oh.  A little down there.  One time.  What?  You told me one time, Amy, Yeager Mouth.  Get off the line, Yeager Mouth.  Oh.  Oh, you're that alcoholic that calls every once in a while.  Once in a while.  Only once before.  What?  Only once before.  Okay.  So, summer camp is very good. 
[00:33:30]  I have to say.  I don't think Cuba Goody Jr. encapsulates summer camp the way that it should be.  I don't think he does.  How long can you go with this thing?  All right.  Ask me what. 
[00:34:00]  It's got such potential, too.  I know.  I was so happy.  All right.  Let's try to get her back on track.  All right.  Let's get.  Hold on.  Hold on, Amy.  I want to get you back on track.  What is your losing virginity story?  Well, the first time I smoked pot and the first time I lost my virginity was in summer camp.  Smoking pot was with girls and the virginity was with a guy. 
[00:34:30]  And he was like, you know, he gave me cigarettes and stuff.  It was like 1988 and I was a Metallica fan and he wore Metallica t-shirts and stuff.  And he gave me some cigarettes and, you know, trapped me in the mess hall sometime, you know, and put me up against the metal, you know.  And he said, you know, you want it?  I said, yeah.  And I said, no. 
[00:35:00]  It was terrible.  It was horrible.  He looked like Kristen Slater in Point Break.  Kristen Slater?  He looked like Kristen Slater in Gleaming the Cube, rather than Point Break.  There's too much.  There's too much feedback going on.  You guys are doing it all.  Yeah, that's what it is, you dummy. 
[00:35:30]  Amy.  So you lost your virginity at summer camp, right?  So, like what?  It was amazing.  All right.  How old were you?  How old were you?  I was 13.  And he was 21.  Where was Chris Hansen back then?  What the hell's up with you?  He was the maintenance man.  I was 13 and it was like an arts camp, you know.  And I was like theater and music and art. 
[00:36:00]  And like.  All right.  So, did he teach you anything that you use these days?  He like got me out of evening activity really early.  Like 15 minutes.  He like leave there early than I did.  And then I met him in my cabin and he would fucking take my shirt off.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  No cursing.  He took your shirt off. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  He took my shirt off.  And, you know.  He, you know.  Before anyone else would get back.  And then one time they, they set a camper, lost camper search, you know, like drill, drill to find the lost campers and stuff.  And so, we all had to like beat, all the bunks had to have their designated area to go find the lost campers. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  You're babbling again.  You're losing us.  You're losing us.  Bring back the sexiness.  Bring back the sexiness.  Let's go.  I was the first one.  I was the first one that they had to do the lost camper search for it during lunch.  That they, that they knew that I wasn't there and only two girls knew where I was.  And where were you?  And where were you?  You know where I was.  No, where were you?  He looked like Christian Slater in Gleaming the Cube.  You're losing us again. 
[00:37:30]  You're losing us.  You dummy.  I was in his little cabin.  I was in his little cabin.  What were you wearing?  What were you wearing?  I don't know.  Metallica t-shirt and jean shorts.  You know, I was 13.  It was like 19.  It was like 1989.  All right.  Get out of here, Amy.  It was like when things were dirty, you know, and things were still dirty and nobody cared.  Yeah.  All right.  Can I just tell you guys?  The story was not sexy.  What?  That I'm happy that K-Rock is back and that I'm happy that, like, other radio stations 
[00:38:00]  are back and that there is no question about rock and roll radio anymore.  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Tell me.  Tell me.  Ask me.  Ask me a question.  What do you want to know?  Yeah.  What do you want to know?  Boy, I haven't killed yourself yet.  What do you want to know?  Ask me a question.  What do you want to know?  We know all we need to know. 
[00:38:30]  What do you want to know?  No, we'll ask you a question.  What do you want to know?  Let's...  You want to know something?  Well, we'll ask you a question.  What do we want to ask Amy, the drunk?  Hmm.  I'm not a drunk.  I'm just an insomniac.  It's not...  It's not insomnia when it's seven o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, but honey, these are my hours.  Like, they're your hours, too.  Why are you an insomniac?  Because I'm a bartender. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, where do you bartend?  In Astoria.  Astoria, yeah?  What kind of bar?  It's like a neighborhood.  Neighborhood bar, lounge.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Uh-oh.  Watch out.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, this humanity.  Oh, jeez.  What's that?  Oh.  Amy. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Amy?  Oh, yeah.  That's...  Uh...  Amy?  Yeah.  Amy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amy?  Oh, wait.  She still has a pulse.  There you go.  Hey, is that a train?  By the way, somebody from their mobile device, did they leave their name?  Yeah, Bobby Bagpipes.  I lost my virginity on the Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor. 
[00:40:00]  Thank you for getting the Spatial Endeavor thing.  Because we love that guy.  Yeah, a lot of people.  Spatial Endeavor.  She didn't even have a good lost her virginity story.  No, man.  If you got a...  Ladies, give us a good I lost my virginity story today, will you?  You know when you start swearing the story stinks?  Yeah.  She's got to spice it up with the N-word.  She can't just say...  She had nothing.  By the way, I'm enjoying the Winkies today on Instant Feedback.  Oh, they're giving you a Winky?  Yeah, the Winky Eye. 
[00:40:30]  That's nice.  Those are the people that were listening the other day.  So then I could figure out what you mean by your comments, if you're being sarcastic and dry,  or if you're meaning what you're saying.  Hope he needs emoticons.  Yes, I need emoticons.  An emoticon.  Hey, is Tom Alive Friday?  Oh, well, here's the official sweeper.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  I'm still standing. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, it's Tom.  I'm still alive.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, we haven't heard from Tom yet, so...  No.  Hopefully, Tom's still alive.  And hopefully, he'll call us sometime between now and 9 o'clock.  You can't control the hospitals?  What?  Yeah.  Hey, what do you got there?  Oh, you're going to live?  All right, I'll talk to you.  It's a great fit.  Well, if he calls up, we know he's alive. 
[00:41:30]  If he doesn't, we have to assume the worst.  Yeah.  They're kind of getting attached to the little bastard.  The little foe.  Yeah.  All right.  And what's more important than friends?  One lonely Friday is not going to call in.  No.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  In the movie coming out this Friday called Parrot Lungs.  A man with the lung capacity of a condom calls a radio show. 
[00:42:00]  Steven S. from Bayshore is really messing me up.  He goes, great show today, Ope.  And then he winky-eyes me.  Oh, ah.  And then he writes, figure that one out.  He's screwing with you.  What the hell does that mean now?  He knows all those brainwashing tricks and torture tricks.  After the break.  I think it's Friday.  Well, I know it's Friday.  So I think it's Friday. 
[00:42:30]  I was going to say, I think we should just kind of get silly and have some fun.  Of course.  So we're going to play some Maury phobia audio.  Oh, Maury.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  We got some phobia audio.  That's just terrific.  The first one is a lady that is scared of birds.  Birds.  It's hilarious.  We'll do it after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We carry on with the Opie and Anthony show.  The Friday edition.  Still waiting to see if Tom's alive today. 
[00:43:00]  You haven't missed anything yet as far as that goes.  Big Doody's Jay from Jersey.  There's no way Daddy Day Camp is going to beat the comedy juggernaut that is Rush Hour 3.  Oh, yeah.  What's up with Rush Hour 3?  Good reviews?  Bad reviews?  Who gives a crap?  One and a half stars.  Nice.  That's the review I saw.  I don't know what Rotten Tomatoes is giving it.  Well, Daddy Day Camp, 2% good reviews from all the reviewers across America.  And we want to read just a couple of these before we move on.  Some would argue that kids aren't as jaded as adults and will enjoy an agonizingly unfunny experience like Daddy Day Camp just fine. 
[00:43:30]  Using the same rationale, you could feed them Alpo.  One of the reviews.  Uh, where's the one that Travis wanted me to read?  Not quite as funny as a perforated ulcer.  This terrible sequel to a bad movie was directed by Fred Savage, the now grown star of the Wonder Years.  Are you kidding?  Though there's no evidence of any behind-the-scenes adult supervision. 
[00:44:00]  An excruciating stew of kindergarten-level toilet humor and an absurd and false sentimentality.  About as much fun as being given a wedgie and hung from the camp flagpole.  What's worse than a listless sequel to a terrible movie?  How about a listless sequel with a far less interesting cast than the first film?  How does Cuba Gooding Jr., Oscar winner, allow himself to be directed by the kid from the Wonder Years? 
[00:44:30]  That's a little weird, right?  That must be a little odd.  And finally, poison ivy jokes, poop jokes, runaway bus jokes, young love jokes, skunk jokes.  Oh, we forgot the skunk!  The skunk!  Of course the skunk's going to be in this movie.  Some fake fatherly tender moments, vomit jokes.  This film has them all.  Sounds like a show.  All right.  We're going to try this virginity thing one more time before we move on to the lady who's scared of birds.  All right.  Rachel in Massachusetts, listening on WBCN. 
[00:45:00]  What's up, Rachel?  Hello.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi, Rachel.  Not too bad.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Just wanted to say that.  Hey, thanks.  So you heard Amy's awful virginity story, right?  Yeah.  All right.  What do you got?  Well, I was probably about 15 at the time, and the boy was wanting me home.  And we just decided to have sex behind a factory in Fall River. 
[00:45:30]  So what happened?  Some details.  It was, you know, radio friendly.  Yeah, you suck at telling a hot story.  I got to tell you.  You got right to the point, don't you?  Yeah, you got right to the point.  Yeah.  We were behind a factory, and we did it.  Huh?  It wasn't even, you know, it wasn't even, like, that sexual at all.  And people were driving by us, like, walking by us, everybody, everything.  It wasn't, you know.  You're losing us.  You're losing us.  You're losing us. 
[00:46:00]  I'm sorry.  All right.  Listen.  We're going to cut our losses.  Is there one lady out there, one woman, one female that could tell us a hot, I lost my  virginity story?  Rachel got right to the point.  What an awful storyteller she is.  15.  My boyfriend at the time decided to have sex.  We did it behind a factory.  Cars were going by.  It wasn't sexy whatsoever.  No, like, how he talked her into it.  Not what I was wearing.  It's like she texted us that sex story. 
[00:46:30]  A text.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  It was key to a virginity story.  You got to say you were, like, a teenage nymph.  Details.  You were wearing short shorts.  Those old pony shorts.  Something, man.  Those chicks used to wear.  Pony, yeah.  Some details.  Like, what did it look like around the area that you were doing it in?  And how did he talk you into it?  What was the first thing that came off? 
[00:47:00]  Right.  Things like that.  All right.  Let's go to Chris and Monroe.  Chris, what's up?  Monroe.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Love the show.  Yeah.  So, I went to the Traveling Virus out in Jones Beach.  Yeah.  Loved it.  Yep.  Made my way home wasted.  Yep.  And then my girlfriend decided that, or actually my best friend decided that he was going to  take me on the 25th for my 22nd birthday, because it's on the August 26th. 
[00:47:30]  The PNC show.  The O&H Traveling Virus when it hits the Jersey area there.  PNC.  August 25th.  Exactly.  All right.  Yep.  What about it?  Wondering if you could make me feel special and, I don't know, say happy birthday or something.  How old are you going to be on the 25th?  I'm going to be on the 25th.  I'll be 21.  On the 26th, I'll be 22.  All right.  Absolutely not.  Happy birthday. 
[00:48:00]  What are we doing?  Happy birthday shout outs?  What?  I really thought you were going to give the guy a shot.  No.  No.  Happy birthday.  You went, ah, absolutely.  I saw that coming a mile away, because there's no way in hell we would do that.  I'm saving that guy a lot of humiliation.  Yep.  It's looking like we're going to have at least 12,000 to 15,000 people at PNC, somewhere in  there, depending on how the tickets go the last couple of weeks.  If we wish that guy Tom a happy birthday, the boos.  Boo. 
[00:48:30]  Who gives a crap?  All right.  Maybe we'll bring him on stage.  If he wants a happy birthday, we'll ask for Tom.  It'll be memorable.  That's right.  He can sing it to himself.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  As we wait to see if Tom's alive, we get to meet Andrea here.  She's afraid of birds.  My name is Andrea, and I am definitely afraid of birds.  They are out to get me.  They know that I hate them.  And the more I run, and the more I try to get them.  I don't like that bird.  I just can't get away from them. 
[00:49:00]  I'm Brian Fellow.  I'm seven years old, walking down the boardwalk to the seagulls.  They just attacked me for my funnel cake.  A funnel cake.  What?  The seagulls attacked her for her funnel cake.  Throw the funnel cake down, you fat slob.  It's a dumb funnel cake.  It's a funnel cake.  If the seagulls are attacking you for a funnel cake, leave the funnel cake.  If it was tiramisu, I would understand.  Tiramisu.  It's a funnel cake.  It's a funnel cake.  If she was using it to funnel more food into her mouth. 
[00:49:30]  It's tiramisu.  Ah, you know.  Maybe a nice slice of cheesecake.  That's right.  But funnel cake.  A funnel cake.  Get a hold of yourself.  Creme brulee.  Right.  You could get another funnel cake.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Where my funnel cake attacked my hands and flapping my face.  I pulled into the store in the parking lot and they started sitting on my car and I was breathing heavy into it.  They started what on her car?  Sitting. 
[00:50:00]  Can I?  Really?  Oh, you thought they said.  Can I hear that again?  Oh, you thought they said something else?  I thought.  I could swear it says something else that would be horrible.  All right.  Let's listen.  They're sitting on my car.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Oh, wow.  All right.  They were sitting on her car?  I pulled into the store in the parking lot and they started sitting on my car.  Wow.  They were sitting on her car.  One more time.  I just got to.  This is from Maury? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So it's got to be that.  Parking lot and they started sitting on my car.  You know how birds can be.  Oh, okay.  We're just idiots, man.  We really are idiots.  Yeah.  Into the store in the parking lot and they started sitting on my car.  I was breathing heavy into a brown paper bag.  Because of you, I don't even hear sitting anymore.  No, it's a.  I hear it differently. 
[00:51:00]  I believe she's saying the birds were sitting on her car.  She pulled into the parking lot.  The birds are sitting on her car.  But it sounded like something that birds can also, you know, do to a car.  Yeah.  Let me hear that one more time.  I pulled into the store in the parking lot and they started sitting on my car.  I was breathing heavy into a brown paper bag.  And there was a bird in the bag. 
[00:51:30]  Oh.  All right.  Let's get through this.  I pulled into the store in the parking lot and they started sitting on my car.  I was breathing heavy into a brown paper bag and I just wanted to run and get away from  them.  And I was just in the store in the corner.  I had to call my sister-in-law to come pick me up and carry me to the car.  Can't breathe.  What should I think about?  I don't know why they always come after me.  Why they always poop in my hair. 
[00:52:00]  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Pooping in a weave.  Maybe it wasn't like a bird's nest.  They wouldn't try to poop in your hair.  All right.  Raise your hand or honk your horn if you're thinking the same thing we are.  There's a reason why the seagulls are following you.  I'm reminded of that commercial with the mother and the daughter walking down the beach.  Yeah.  Seagulls following you?  It's time to freshen up. 
[00:52:30]  You smell like old pennies.  You got to freshen up, man.  Something's going on down there.  That would be a great commercial.  A bird's following your vagina.  They was chasing me and they was pecking at my pants.  I don't know what happened.  Well, the best part of these phobia shows, you know, more he just gets sick.  I don't know how he's going to bring birds out on stage.  All right. 
[00:53:00]  You got to overcome.  You're a wonderful lady with a lot to live for.  You got to overcome this fear.  Yeah.  Let's release the birds.  Vultures.  Like some frigging condors.  Things like 12 foot wingspans.  Brings an ostrich.  An ostrich to kick her.  He gives her an ostrich egg.  Cover her in bird feed. 
[00:53:30]  Just cover her in, like, melted sugar and bird feed and release giant birds of prey.  Falcons and eagles.  Strap meat on her chest.  Strap dead rabbits to her.  Make her run from eagles.  Salmon hanging off her neck.  Just give her some kind of wound and release the vulture.  Seriously, strap it to a tree and just slice her open.  There we go. 
[00:54:00]  It continues.  She's really obsessed with it.  In this next clip, she's really obsessed with the fact that the birds are pooping on her.  Yeah.  You really believe they have singled you out?  They singled me out.  All the people on the boardwalk, and they chose me.  How many times have you been pooped on?  Close to 20 or more.  Always.  The birds?  Yes.  Always.  Since I was a kid, they loved to poop on me.  In my hair.  Everywhere.  I was eating ice cream, and I just saw something dripping in my ice cream, and it was poop. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, what's wrong with this lady?  Stop eating ice cream and funnel cakes.  Yeah.  Under a tree.  What the hell is going on?  Pilot to Bombardier.  Pilot to Bombardier.  Wow.  We have a douche eating.  I saw something dripping in my ice cream, and it was poop.  It's horrible.  It's not funny.  It's horrible.  What happened last week?  I was in Walmart.  I was driving into Walmart, and they smelled my fear, Marv. 
[00:55:00]  They knew it was me.  They smelled your fear?  Yes, they smelled my fear as soon as I pulled into Walmart.  That's not what they were smelling.  That's not what they were smelling.  She calls it her fear.  Yeah.  Her fear.  They smelled her fear.  I get my fear once a month.  My fear.  Fear's visiting.  Hey, Mommy, my fear's here.  Aunt Fear is visiting.  Aunt Fear has decided to visit.  Do you have any fear pads? 
[00:55:30]  As soon as I pulled into Walmart's parking lot, they just started sitting on top of the  car, flying in front of my mirror, sitting in my window.  You couldn't get out of there, could you?  No.  You had to call somebody, didn't you?  Yes.  Who'd you call?  I called my sister-in-law, Mary.  Mary?  Yes.  Mary?  I thought she, her purse was snatched or her car broke down.  She said, because the birds, they won't let me out.  When I got there, Maury, she was all the way in the back of the...  Where do you live?  The Galapagos Islands. 
[00:56:00]  I was making baskets and braiding pretty ladies' hair.  What do you do for a living?  I work in an aviary.  No wonder they're crapping on you, you dummy.  Mary, she was all the way in the back of the store, down in the corner, talking about  the birds, the birds, I can't get out.  Enough about the birds.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  So, of course, now Maury, in one quick hour show, has to solve everybody's phobias, because 
[00:56:30]  that's all it takes, to get on a national talk show, and then they could, you know...  Cure you like that.  They could cure you like that.  No matter what your problems are.  So, sick Maury decides to bring out a bird for Andrea.  Listen to this clip.  We have to face your fears.  We have to have you face your fears.  He's sick.  We have to have you face your fears.  No, you don't.  No.  And his voice changes, too.  You're going to have to face your fears.  You don't have to. 
[00:57:00]  That's the most basic advice you can give anybody.  It's Maury.  Just face your fears.  Just face it.  You're afraid of heights?  You've got to go to the top of the Empire State Building.  Right.  No.  No, I don't.  No, I don't have to do that.  You're afraid of planes?  Get on a plane.  No.  Maury's getting turned on by...  Afraid of water?  Swim.  No.  Listen to his voice change.  Yeah, come on.  You've got to face your fears.  Face your fears.  Come to Daddy Maury.  All right.  Bring out.  We've cloned a pterodactyl.  Bring it out.  Carries her away and rips her in three pieces. 
[00:57:30]  Craps on a dead corpse.  And feeds her to her young...  To little baby.  Right.  Just see her weave being regurgitated into a big pterodactyl baby's mouth.  Oh, they make a nest out of it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, wow.  And then just regurgitate her funnel cake.  Stupid funnel cake.  We have to face your fears.  We have to have you face your fears, Andrea.  Bring out the birds. 
[00:58:00]  Just look over there.  Just one.  No.  Wait a second, Andrea.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Don't do this.  This is helping.  This is helping.  This is good.  The music and Maury's dressed like Big Bird.  Maury's in a Big Bird.  Where are you going?  Wait, wait.  Come back.  This is not helping her at all.  Dramatic music.  He's traumatizing. 
[00:58:30]  You know, she could go to therapy for probably years, and they would start out with pictures  in a book of a bird.  Sure.  Or a feather.  Cartoon birds.  Cartoon birds.  A feather duster.  Right.  Something like that.  Not just, bring out a whole flock of birds.  And start the dramatic music.  And no matter how much she screams, keep the birds are coming.  Lock the exits.  Throw funnel cakes at her.  Turn down the lights.  You turn off the lights. 
[00:59:00]  Bring out the owls.  They can see good in the dark.  Turn the strobe light on.  Cover her with worms.  What do you got, Danny?  Well, I was just going to say, I mean, you heard how upset she was getting.  I do believe that was over a parakeet in a cage.  Oh, come on.  Are you serious?  A parakeet.  If I remember correctly, that's what it was.  And that's the only bird he brought out?  Yeah, they might have had another cage with more birds in it as well, but I believe that  particular clip was just one parakeet. 
[00:59:30]  That parakeet's got to feel badass, man.  Yeah.  Just got to start thinking, you know, I'm going to tell these other parakeets, we have  a shot here.  Yeah.  We have a shot at this planet.  With women like that running around.  What?  She lost her mind.  Jimmy Hatz from FBA.  Maury turns into Vince McMahon.  Bring out the birds.  The birds.  Come on, bring them out.  You'll like those birds, don't you?  Bring out the birds. 
[01:00:00]  You're scared, aren't you?  Come on, look at the birds.  Just angry Vince.  Look at the bird.  You're scared.  They're scared.  Tear down a wall.  You know, Maury is hoping that she's going to freak out.  That's the whole reason to do this show.  He doesn't want to care or anything.  Who is the wrestler with the bird?  Oh, Coco Beware.  Bring out Coco Beware.  Come on, look at Coco's bird. 
[01:00:30]  Just angry Vince.  Release the birds.  You're scared of birds, are you?  Well, bring them out.  You're not going anywhere.  Come on, look at the birds.  Oh, I can't tell you.  Look out.  Take off your bra.  Wrap this raw meat around your arm.  Get out of here.  Here we go.  He steps into an exploding limo. 
[01:01:00]  And a wrestler chokes his family.  Oh, Jesus.  That's what happens.  Oh, boy.  We were having fun, too.  Yeah, I know.  Why?  Had to take it there.  Yeah.  Let's go back to birds.  Wait a second, I'm there.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Ah!  Don't do this.  Ah!  It's not the bird.  Ah!  Run it over.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Are you okay?  Oh, my God.  Hey. 
[01:01:30]  A gram.  A gram.  One bird.  It's one little bird.  You think she's kidding now?  You think she's acting now?  I don't think so.  Look at Maury.  Maury is so into it.  You're sick of it.  Is this acting?  This is authentic fear.  I think she's going to die.  Right.  You think she's acting now?  No. 
[01:02:00]  Bring out more.  More birds.  This is just pour a bucket of bird poop on, like, a carry.  Just the door's shut.  No, instead of, yeah, reenact the scene from Carrie, but instead of the blood falling from  the sky, it's just a bucket of bird seed, dumping right on her head.  I love Maury's advice, too.  He says, psychologist, it's just one bird.  It's one bird.  Come on.  Oh, he gets so excited, man.  Oh, he loves it.  Yeah, just dump a bucket of honey all over it, and then a bucket of bird seed. 
[01:02:30]  Bird seed.  And then release the...  Just a blinding amount of birds.  The whole studio just turns completely...  It's full of birds.  You just hear that flapping sound.  You can barely hear her screams over there.  And then, you know, at the end of this, he should give her a trip to that place out there  where you used to, with the birds, the thing.  The birds come back every year.  Oh, Capistrano.  Right.  We're giving you a trip to San Juan Capistrano. 
[01:03:00]  And she's screaming, like, oh, my God, thank you.  Where the swallows come back.  Right.  You could go to the mission at San Juan Capistrano, where you could get a bunch of swallow poop  on you.  Wah!  Did they keep getting out?  The kids in the Hitchcock movie, The Birds, didn't get this upset.  Right now.  I can't get enough of this.  You think she's acting now?  I don't think so. 
[01:03:30]  Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, stand up.  Stand up.  It's going to be all right.  I'm going to take him away.  I'm going to take him away.  Stand up.  Okay.  You don't even want to look at him.  Andrea, stand up.  Stand up.  We're going to take him away.  They're gone.  They're gone.  Stand up here.  Oh, gosh.  Oh.  We're going to help him.  We'll be back right after this. 
[01:04:00]  Andrea, it's all over.  We'll be back right after this.  I thought I saw a hyperventilating.  I did.  I did.  I did see a hyperventilating.  Oh, my God.  Stupid woman.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  You guys missed the obvious when you were talking about Vince McMahon.  Yeah.  Her and the parakeet in a cage match. 
[01:04:30]  How about a cage match?  You and a parakeet.  You and a parakeet in a cage match.  No holes barred.  At Summer Slam.  Right.  No holes barred.  No holes barred.  Come on.  Get in the cage.  Angry Vince.  Let's say hi to Jeff.  Come on.  Get in the cage.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Jeff in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:05:00]  Hey.  Hey, I just want to know, do they play Iran by Flakka Seagull?  Might as well.  Or get the theme from that old Hitchcock Birds movie, yeah.  Let's say hi to Chrissy, a girl in Philly listening on WISP.  Chrissy, what's up?  Chrissy.  You guys totally missed it.  When she said that she'd been pooped on 20 times, Maury had to ask her, by birds?  God, how did we miss that?  Was it the last clip to play?  By birds? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, now we're going to have to find that.  Let's come out.  Now we've got to hear that again.  We'll try to find that during the break, all right?  Hopefully we'll find out soon if Tom's alive.  It is Tom alive.  Friday.  Yeah.  We haven't heard from Tom yet.  If you don't know about this, we'll explain the whole thing after the break, okay?  Right.  All right.  And also, more of Maury's phobia show.  I love how he cures him.  That woman seems fine now.  It's the next one good?  He's a miracle worker.  Yeah, he just... 
[01:06:00]  Keep your laughter to yourself.  Scares them.  He did it right before the commercial, too.  Puts them in a catatonic stage where a bird can now land on her head and she'll just sit  there and drool.  We'll be back right after these messages.  What an ass.  We love Maury.  Hey, Rolls.  She's just under a tree, birds all over her.  She doesn't care.  She's just saying, birds, birds, birds.  That's it.  Get down and tweet like a bird for me.  Come on. 
[01:06:30]  Tweet like a bird.  That's it.  I love Angry Vince.  Angry Vince rocks.  I was doing a show when I was in Montreal doing the Nasty Show.  One of the comics wouldn't come in the room when I was eating bananas.  It's afraid of bananas?  It's afraid of banana peels.  Why?  Is he a carton?  A comic that's afraid of banana peels.  And this guy's like real dirty, real edgy.  I was like, you know, mate, can you let me know when you're done eating the banana? 
[01:07:00]  What's his name?  Jim Jeffries.  All right.  If you're going to see Jim Jeffries soon, please throw a banana peel up on stage.  I mean, he was petrified of it.  Banana peels.  Petrified.  I mean, I thought he was joking.  How can they hurt you?  He petrified.  Wouldn't come in the room.  Wow.  I had to throw it out in the garbage.  It's an odd phobia.  Yeah.  Well, after the break, we got Carolyn.  She's afraid of cotton balls.  Wow.  Only imagine what they do to her.  Carolyn, afraid of cotton balls after the break.  There's only one cure for this. 
[01:07:30]  That's right.  Carolyn is afraid of cotton balls.  After the break, Carolyn, who's afraid of cotton balls.  Tell me.  Tell me.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Go to Robert Kelly live for his tour dates.  But basically, he's playing Bohegan Sun tonight and tomorrow.  Friday, Saturday night.  Yeah.  There you go.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  The return of What the Hell is That to the Opie and Anthony show was an overnight success.  Oh, my God.  This is awesome.  Who could forget the sounds of cysts being ruptured and Bob Kelly vomiting into a bucket?  Oh, Bob.  He's...  Bob.  He's puking.  Well, we're going down that pus-filled road again, kids.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  If you have a bump, boil, bruise, legion, pustule, cyst, inflammation, or otherwise unidentifiable  oddity on your person, then you're perfect for What the Hell is That? 
[01:08:30]  See?  That's why the show's called What the Hell is That?  Email Travis at foundrymusic.com with your ailment or freakish growth and your contact  information, and we'll have our crack team of medical professionals take a gander at it  and most likely giggle at it.  It's the return of the return of What the Hell is That on the Opie and Anthony show.  I can't explain how gross it is.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:09:00]  Want to send a message to the Opie and Anthony show?  Not you.  Go to opieandanthony.com and click on live feedback.  Like I'm a computer idiot over here.  It'll get red, but it may not get respect.  Oh, gosh.  If you're using a cell phone or a PDA, why don't you send some messages to feedback at opieandanthony.com?  You can reboot it.

Opie and Anthony. 
[01:09:30]  Infamous CJs.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah, Opie and Anthony.  It's Friday.  It's F.U. Friday.  It's Point and Laugh Friday.  It's Air Guitar Friday.  Um.  Oh, you're doing a little air guitar there.  Oh, yeah.  Something's been, uh, brought to my attention.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  What do you got?  What is, uh, E-Rod?  What do you, you got a mic?  What are you drinking this morning?  Nothing right now.  Why?  No?  What did you have to drink?  This morning?  Yeah.  I had a chocolate milk.  Okay.  People are suggesting perhaps the Fat Smash thing is over when you're drinking Nesquik.  Oh, my God.  He had a thing of Nesquik. 
[01:10:30]  I love reduced fat chocolate.  I would love reduced.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Reduced.  You fall for the reduced fat crap.  Reduced from what?  Let me see.  How many calories in that bag?  All right.  Opie knows, uh, how to read these bottles and stuff.  What's up?  Ah, just 200 calories.  200 calories for a beverage.  For a beverage.  First thing in the morning.  I would love to drink this every morning.  Wouldn't it taste good?  I'm sure it's delicious.  Right?  Oh, my.  I would love this every morning.  I'm eating awful egg whites, again, with horrible raw vegetables. 
[01:11:00]  God bless you, Ryan.  Right.  Well, if he was on Weight Watchers, he could have that.  That would just be pretty much it for the day.  Did you make a, you just kind of decided, conscious decision?  What?  No, I'm saying for a split second.  I'm just saying.  Oh, Jesus.  He's, he's throwing things.  Keep giving me this stupid pink flamingo and putting it on my lap. 
[01:11:30]  Are you afraid of pink flamingos?  Pink flamingo.  What's the pink flamingo thing all about?  Come on, have the pink flamingo.  Put it on your lap.  He's the pink flamingo.  Look, they're passing out flyers.  That's Eric's wrestling name.  That's his wrestling name now?  The pink flamingo?  Oh, nice.  I like that.  Can I see?  When you grabbed that Nestle's quick, did you think, like, maybe I shouldn't have this?  Or did you even give it a second thought?  I'm just, I'm just asking. 
[01:12:00]  No.  No what?  I said, screw it.  I want it.  But you, but you knew it was not good.  Oh, my God.  He's throwing that pink flamingo around.  Why are you throwing the pink flamingo around?  Because every time I'm doing something or talking, all of a sudden, in my peripheral vision,  the pink flamingo slowly comes.  And you're what?  It's mispronunciation, Friday.  Let them be.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm just going to question anything.  Okay, then I can do this.  Why?  Why are you pointing and laughing at me?  It's Point and Laugh Friday.  That's right.  Yeah.  Come on.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander. 
[01:12:30]  Ah, birds!  Ah!  Guys, geese and ganders!  Come on!  Take the gander!  What's a gander?  Someone had a great line on Instant Feedback.  I don't have it in front of me anymore, but it's Maury going,  After these messages, the birds will sing, turn, turn, turn.  As she screams.  Oh, Steve's got the flamingo.  He's taunting.  He's taunting E-Rock with the flamingo. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, and see, E-Rock's not brave enough to, like, give Steve any bonk.  He won't whack it out of Steve's hand, I don't think.  No.  Come on, E-Rock.  Just take it out of his hand.  He's making him kiss.  Take it out of his hand.  The flamingo.  Take it out of his hand.  There you go!  Take it out of his hand!  Punch Steve in the mouth.  Smash it with the flamingo.  Aw, Steve's hugging him now.  Big bear.  What are you doing?  Oh!  It's mad.  He's really angry.  He's angry so quick.  I don't think he likes the fact that everybody picked up on the Nesquik. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, boy.  He's breaking the pink flamingo's neck.  Aw.  And I saw Travis run out of the studio.  That can mean only one thing.  They already have a replacement.  Yeah, of course.  There's another pink flamingo.  These creeps invested in flamingos.  Where the hell do they get all these pink flamingos?  They actually raided a gay bar last night just to mess with Eric tonight.  How many pink flamingos do you guys have, realistically, here?  How many?  That might be the last one.  Oh, boy.  It was Ralph in Belleville for that line. 
[01:14:00]  Thank you, Ralph.  All right.  Why don't we move on here?  It's also Is Tom Alive Friday?  Yeah, we got to know.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  He's in.  We have to be in.  We have to be in.  Don't you know I'm still standing?  Better than I ever did.  Oh, is Tom?  Tom still alive?  On the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:30]  Oof.  Yeah, Tom called a few Fridays ago, and he basically gave us some bad news.  Is that he's got this really, really bad disease.  Lung disease.  That's kind of closing up his lungs slowly.  The doctor gave him seven years to live, and he's up to six.  He's on year six.  He's on year six.  Seven to go.  Seven to live, and that leaves a year.  And it looks like the only way for him to survive is to get, like, a double lung heart transplant eventually.  Yeah.  And what was the other thing?  Oh, yeah.  And if it gets to the point where he can't handle it anymore, he's already decided he will blow his brains out. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  All right.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Take me back.  Take me back.  Spatial Endeavor.  It's Endeavor Friday.  Spatial Endeavor.  Endeavor. 
[01:15:30]  Spatial Endeavor.  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  He just lets the rest of the word just keep going.  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Replace the challenger.  Tom is...  Uh-oh.  Alive!  Ah.  Ah.  I feel alive.  Yeah, Tom.  Tom.  Tom's still alive.  We're... 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, Tom.  Hey, Tom.  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  Tommy, are you breathing?  Dun-dun.  I'm still breathing.  All right.  So what's...  What's...  Huh?  I can...  Uh-oh.  Add one more injury to the list.  Add another injury to the list?  I just want to know how was, you know, the last year of your life there.  See, to...  Because to you, like, a week going by is like a year. 
[01:16:30]  So how was...  How did you...  What did you do in the last year there?  Oh, it was fabulous.  I, uh...  I went to the doctor last week.  And...  Oh, sorry about that.  That's okay.  You had to breathe.  Don't scare us.  And, uh...  Uh...  Breathing test, uh...  A little bad, a little bad.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:17:00]  You're sounding a little bad today.  You don't sound as good as last week there, Tom.  Uh, uh...  Yeah, I...  I called, uh, earlier, but, uh...  What did the doctor...  Dude, what did the doctor say?  Uh...  Stick your head between your knees and kiss...  It's a part of your anatomy goodbye.  No way.  Hold on a minute. 
[01:17:30]  I want to help out this phone call.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, that's not nice.  Oh, look at me.  He's laughing on the phone.  Guy's got a good sense of humor.  He's laughing.  He's wheezing.  So, Tom, uh...  The doctor...  It wasn't...  Actually, it wasn't that bad.  I mean, it was worse than, uh...  Than...  Marches.  So, uh... 
[01:18:00]  Oh, so worse...  I could tell that...  I could tell that just the way I'm breathing.  Really?  It's getting harder to breathe?  Yeah.  You know, it's been going downhill since March, so...  Oh, since March, April, May, June, July, August.  Oh, man.  That sucks.  And you could tell by the breathing test, huh?  Oh, I can tell just by my breathing, but the breathing test confirms that it's a little  more accurate.  What's the breathing test?  Does it let it match and you have to blow it out? 
[01:18:30]  Don't make him laugh.  Oh, Jesus.  That's not good.  Did you just...  Hey, Bob, you're killing.  First time in his life.  Oh!  Next month couldn't come quick enough.  So, Tom.  Yes, Anthony.  Well, that was Opie, but...  Whatever.  What are you going to do?  We'll touch you some slack.  It doesn't really matter. 
[01:19:00]  Call him anything you want.  Opie, Anthony.  So, Tom, since the last time we talked to you, what have you been up to?  What have you been doing?  Gasping.  Well, uh...  Besides gasping.  Jesus.  I was doing some work on our website.  I sent you guys the, uh...  The x-ray?  Yeah, we saw your chest x-ray.  It's up on our website.  Interesting.  There's some kind of spider-looking thing in one of your lungs.  Yeah, it's all scar tissue. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, is it?  It's wrapped around my bronchies.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That doesn't sound good.  Uh...  Breathing in is easy.  Breathing out is hard.  Really?  That's what they give.  Yeah.  You can, like, hold your breath.  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  You guys have me on a disadvantage.  I already took my pain medication for my broken back.  What?  You have a broken back?  Why do you have a broken back?  Uh...  From the prednisone. 
[01:20:30]  Uh...  It, uh...  Weakened my...  Weakened my, uh...  Bones.  And then, uh...  So...  At some point, uh...  In the past seven, six years, uh...  I broke my back.  You don't know when you did it?  Uh...  I'm pretty sure I know when I did it.  It was when I was hit by a car.  Oh, my God!  All right.  What the hell is wrong with... 
[01:21:00]  What did you do?  Huh?  What happened to you?  Were you Hitler in, uh...  The Last Life?  You're the reincarnation of Hitler.  Well...  When it goes to that theory, I very well could have been.  So you were hit by a car...  Which broke your back.  So you're taking painkillers for that.  Not because your lungs are shutting down slowly.  No.  No.  It's, uh...  For... 
[01:21:30]  For, uh...  Severe back pain.  Yeah.  From the, uh...  Accident.  Right.  How'd you get hit by a car?  What were you doing?  Breathing.  I was on vacation, and every...  In Massachusetts...  Mm-hmm.  Every corner has, you know, yield for pedestrians.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Sure enough, you know, the woman yielded, let me pass.  And I'm looking to watch this car making a left. 
[01:22:00]  And next thing I know, I'm flying up in the air over this woman's car, breaking her antenna, landing down on the back of my head and neck.  And, uh...  Uh...  The ambulance is, like, saying, yo, dude, we're just, like, getting off shift, man.  And the hospital's, like, an hour away.  Uh...  You don't look that bad. 
[01:22:30]  The aristocrats.  They took me back to my bed and breakfast.  And the same woman that hit me was the same woman that delivered my pizza.  Oh, my God.  You know, you're getting everyone depressed.  Let's, uh...  Let's play a little more music.  Is there anyone out there?  Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe.  Is there anyone out there? 
[01:23:00]  Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe.  Hmm.  Tom, you've had a string of bad luck.  You must be used to this sound.  What did you do?  Rape a leprechaun?  It was burning all those...  It was burning all those used in my past life.  In a past life, right?  What did you do, man?  What did you do in a past life?  What?  No one deserves this.  Did you work in a mirror factory and just went nuts one day? 
[01:23:30]  Hold on a minute.  Let's, uh...  Let's say hi to Molly in Massachusetts.  Molly, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I'm sitting here listening to this.  This is just completely heartbreaking that this guy's living, like, week to week.  And here I am smoking my 22-year-old healthy lungs away.  Ah, you're smoking, huh?  You're a fool.  Yeah.  Well, she's alive.  Hey, Tom, tell her.  Tell her.  I never smoked a day in my life.  You should have.  Yeah.  Let's start now.  I hadn't done a path.  Not good. 
[01:24:00]  Making me, you know, think about quitting because of this.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  At least my life spent something.  I mean, you can barely carry it.  At least my life spent something.  I don't know.  I saved a girl from Massachusetts, a state I hate.  Yeah, you got hit by a car there, honey.  All right, listen.  Chris from Staten Island has a problem with this whole thing.  Chris, what's up?  You're on with Tom from White Plains.  No, I don't have a problem with it, but you guys are going to hell in a handbag, bro. 
[01:24:30]  Why?  Come on, man.  Let me ask you a question.  Seriously, if it was somebody that you love, God forbid, would you goof on it as well?  We've goofed on people in our own lives.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You've got to have a sense of humor in the end.  Tom.  I do.  I do.  How about we ask Tom.  Hold on, Chris.  Seriously.  Tom, do you mind that we're doing this every week?  If I minded, I wouldn't have called back.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Don't laugh too much, Tom.  Huh?  You guys got to do like a make-a-wish foundation for this guy.  Grant him a wish or something.  Something to make him happy.  Come on.  This might end either with a wake or maybe a double lung heart transplant.  Who knows?  Let him get his double lung heart transplant.  Let the guy live forever.  God bless him.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  How's that looking, Tom?  How's that looking, Tom?  Any prospects about the lungs and a heart transplant or something?  No, no, not yet.  Not yet. 
[01:25:30]  The lungs have to get a little more white.  They're pretty white, huh?  Oh, Jesus.  The side view, man, it looks pretty white.  It's not like they're going to get better, so why don't they just put one in now?  I bet if you were famous, they'd have to find a donor, and they don't want to waste, you  know, three organs.  It's kind of like Southeast Asia. 
[01:26:00]  They just, they'll kill a kid over there for like 20 bucks for you, and they'll get a  fresh set of lungs and a heart.  You can actually have sex with them first, but we'll kill them.  Yeah, they don't care.  Life is cheap over there.  You know, as we move on with this whole thing, this could get really interesting.  I mean, you know, it could raise awareness for donor transplant.  We should do a make a breath foundation.  Blow out the candle and make a wish.  He can't do it.  Our Celisa breath foundation.  Well, Tom, I think you gave us a lot this week. 
[01:26:30]  We learned a little more about you, that you have the worst luck in the world.  Stay inside, Tom.  And stop ordering pizza.  Yeah.  No, I did.  No, I order the dinners.  Yeah.  You order the dinners?  You don't have to rush them as fast.  They stay hotter longer.  Yeah.  All right.  Anything else we want to ask Tom today?  Wow. 
[01:27:00]  Is it ticking?  I'm punching out.  It's ticking clock in the background.  Yeah.  You're just punching out for today, right?  Punching out for today.  That's right.  Tom, I get more questions about you than anything else we're doing on the show lately.  And it's true that you're going to kill yourself before it gets too bad, right?  Yeah.  If I lose the use of my legs.  Why?  That could happen?  Uh, why, I have no feeling in them already. 
[01:27:30]  What, because are you a broken back or the lung thing?  Uh, there, uh, there's, uh, in my spinal cord, there's, uh, uh, some lesions.  And, uh, what the hell?  You are a mess.  Oh!  Yeah.  I hate to bring it all out.  I'm not looking for pity.  Yeah.  Well, you're not getting any on this program. 
[01:28:00]  We're just saying.  It's, uh, that is a bitch, man.  Wow.  You have lesions on your spinal cord, so you have no feeling in your legs?  Yeah.  And, uh, on my hands, on my, uh, ring finger and pinky and going up the glove, uh, I don't  have any feelings, uh, on either of those.  All right.  Obviously, you're bringing us all down again, so we need some music to bring everyone back  up.  All right. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  I feel better.  I feel better, dude.  Thanks.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, you rocked it up.  All right.  So, so what did we learn today from Tom?  Not only does he have this awful disease where he needs a double lung heart transplant, he  broke his back.  After getting hit by a car, they gave him pain medication. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, but the car that hit him was the same car that delivered his pizza.  Delivered his pizza.  The ambulance guy was actually getting off work, so they really didn't want to take him  to the hospital because it was a shift change.  Yeah.  So he has a broken back for that.  But then, now he's got numb legs and he's got legions on his spine?  Legions.  Legions, excuse me, on his spinal cord?  Okay, we don't have to apologize.  Oh, mispronunciation fraud.  Legions of Romans on his spine.  Legions.  Just like the ones in my lungs. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, wow.  I can send you a CT in my spinal cord.  Were you just sipping on something or was that your lung actually?  Yeah, what was it?  It sounded like you were finishing up a milkshake.  Uh, no, it was, uh, it was, uh, water.  Coming out of you?  Like, you, or you drinking?  No, no, I was drinking some water through a straw.  Okay.  All right, well.  No, it was really my lung collapsing. 
[01:30:00]  Good character.  Ah, you gotta give it up.  He's got a great sense of humor.  The only reason we're doing this is because the guy has a great sense of humor about that.  Was that you doing a pity laugh?  Who, me?  Yeah.  No.  All right, Paul in Philly, what's up?  Real fast.  Hey, uh, why don't you and, uh, you and Anthony put your celebrity to, uh, good use and, uh,  try and get him a, uh, long.  Well, maybe someone should...  I mean, listeners want to give up their lungs.  Yeah, how do we get longs?  Yeah, we're going to cut open an intern? 
[01:30:30]  No, no, I mean, just put out a, put out a call to, like, a surgeon somewhere.  Well, this, uh, this, uh, this time is getting a lot of attention out there.  So, who knows?  We'll see how this ends.  I'm hoping it ends nice.  Yeah, he lives.  It's either going to end with, uh, some kind of transplant going on or a gunshot.  But if you live, Tom, no, you'll never be on the show again.  So, this is your only chance at fame.  All right, Tom, any, uh, any last words just in case?  Yeah.  Uh, have a great weekend. 
[01:31:00]  Oof.  All right, I like that.  It's just, it's optimistic.  You know what we say to you?  I hope you make it through the weekend.  Well, have a great weekend.  Thanks, little Jimmy.  That's, uh, Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly.  But again, it doesn't matter.  Oh, Bob, I'm sorry.  It doesn't matter, dude.  You're on Cody.  That's a harsh comment I gave you, too.  A weekend for Tom is four months, so.  That's like 70% of his life.  Yeah.  At this point.  All right.  He's like a mayfly.  I hope he lives.  All right, there's your update. 
[01:31:30]  Tom is alive.  Yes.  Wait, wait, don't say bye-bye.  Oh, no.  You mean you're just hanging up the phone?  I thought it was over.  He said he didn't put on the music.  Yeah, but bye-bye is so final.  It really is.  Say so long.  Yeah.  See you next week.  Something like that.  We'll see you next Friday, uh, hopefully. 
[01:32:00]  Talk to you next week.  Hopefully, right?  There we go.  Yeah.  All right.  God willing.  All right.  God willing.  Thank you, Tom.  It's going to sound like Buddy Epson.  Thank you.  At the end of that whole episode.  There he goes.  Tom from White Plains.  He is alive.  Is Tom alive Friday?  He is.  He is.  He is.  He is.  He is.  He is.  Don't you know I am still standing?  Little than I ever did.  Oh, it's Tom.  Tom. 
[01:32:30]  Tom's still alive.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  You know what we got to do next week if Tom's alive?  Because we're getting to know him a little more every week.  Yeah.  We got to do some kind of like make a wish thing.  What does he want to do?  Yeah.  That we could do.  What does he want to do?  We can help him out there.  Anything from hookers to a trip to Disney.  You can't really give him a hooker.  He'd be out of breath.  Disney.  That too.  I'm just saying.  Put him on the space mountain. 
[01:33:00]  It might be something simple.  Who knows?  We'll find out next week what Tom wants.  Hike Everest?  How about a tank of oxygen?  We'll find out and we'll make it happen.  That'll do.  Climb to the summit of a speed bump?  I'll write that check next week.  We'll find out what Tom wants to do.  What does he want to do?  We'll do a little make a wish thing with Tom.  Maybe we'll just blow pollen in his face.  That's not very nice.  See what happens. 
[01:33:30]  I think we'll know what happens.  We're going to face your fears like Murray said.  Face your fears.  We're going to blow pollen in your face.  You can't breathe.  You're afraid of dying.  That's right.  Breathe in the pollen.  I'm going to duct tape your mouth shut and then hold your nose.  Go ahead.  Breathe in the pollen.  This is a good point.  That guy from Philly listening on YSP is like, hey, get him some longs.  Well, Matt has a good observation.  Matt, go ahead.  Yeah, you guys can't even get new bumper stickers.  How are you going to get somebody's long? 
[01:34:00]  Damn, that is perfect.  Good point, Matt.  Good point.  You're going to get longs.  You guys are going to get bumper stickers?  While we were meeting with Tracy yesterday, supposedly the wow stickers are going to be ready just in time for fall.  Okay, good.  Even though this is a great summer promotion, this quick amount Wednesday thing.  The warm weather.  It takes like a day to make a bumper sticker.  Whatever.  Not in the corporate world.  And it's not her fault because she'll yell at us after the show going, ugh.  Who's Tracy?  We know it's not your fault.  Whoa. 
[01:34:30]  The one that you said was really hot.  Oh, her?  Yeah.  Our PD walked in, Tracy, and Bob was like drooling on himself after she left.  She's, I mean, she's, but you know, you ever have a type?  That's your type?  Well, you're just like, oh my God.  She walked in, I was like, that's it.  Wow.  Did you hear me clam up?  I couldn't even talk.  Yeah.  I was trying to act kind of cool like Burt Reynolds.  Yeah.  Kind of cool like Burt Reynolds?  What the hell century is this?  Who's cool to you?  There's a picture of her there.  There you go.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Bobby lost his mind when we went to break after Tracy came in and said hi to everybody. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  Yeah?  You like that, right?  Oh, my God.  What would you do with that, Bobby?  Anything I was told.  I'd clean her pool.  I'd take her garbage out.  Why don't you take charge?  Okay.  I'd hold her down.  I'd put her hair in a scrunchie and I'd paint her toenails.  And then I'd act like Burt Reynolds.  Yeah.  What's wrong with Burt Reynolds?  He was cool.  It was in 77. 
[01:35:30]  Well, who's your idol?  Who would you say?  I don't have one.  Oh, really?  I'm an adult.  No.  I don't sit there and watch movies and go, oh, I wish I was him.  No, you just make them and put them on your MySpace.  Freaking adult.  Booby man from Brooklyn.  A little callback to, I think, yesterday's show in Larry King's voice.  Updated.  I love when it does that.  Breathing.  Breathing.  Is it important or overrated? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Lungs.  How important are the lungs when it comes to breathing?  All right.  We'll take a break.  Hey, Tom, if you're still listening, we want to know what your wish is.  And you got to tell everybody next Friday when you call the show.  I don't like that Than will think of, like, a funny line and, like, run over and maybe,  hey, dude, check this.  Like, he'll fly to you guys.  He actually thought of a funny line for me.  And he walked over here so slow, threw it at me, and goes, eh, whatever.  What was the line? 
[01:36:30]  Could you show some enthusiasm?  Yeah, Than's a comic, like, you know, like Bobby.  Than is hilarious.  But every once in a while, if he digs it, he'll be like, yeah, check it.  He knows that it's all about timing, so he should get it over to you quickly.  He actually was like, ah, and then he threw it, and he didn't even make it.  I had to reach over your console to get it.  It was like, it says Lonely Ant 15.  That would have been hilarious.  At the time, it would have been hilarious.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're a little late. 
[01:37:00]  What?  Nothing.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shop Jock.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:37:30]  There are a lot of bands that sounded.  All the bands sounded.  All the bands sounded.  Oh, I'm still alive.  That was quite the sound of the 90s, wasn't it? 
[01:38:00]  It sure was.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got more phobias.  Also, what else is happening in the world today?  Just to make sure we're on top of things here.  They got the air pipe thing down to the miners or whatever.  What were they doing?  They were drilling all night long.  Oh, the miners that are trapped.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they were drilling a little hole down into where they believed they were.  They're not even quite sure, but where they believed they were, they were drilling a hole 
[01:38:30]  and they dropped the microphone down there and heard nothing.  Nothing.  And then they took some readings on the air and found that it is breathable.  There's some oxygen down there, but there's also, you know, carbon dioxide.  But thank God, no methane gas or anything like that.  Right.  But they haven't found them, so they're making a bigger hole and they're going to drop a camera down  and take a little peeksy around.  Didn't you think that this wouldn't be a problem anymore in the year 2007? 
[01:39:00]  They would have some kind of...  Robot miners.  Robot miners.  There you go.  That's what I was saying.  There you go.  They could take the ballplayers on the offseason, the robot ballplayers, and put them in the mines.  They're robots.  They don't care.  No.  Robots.  Why aren't we utilizing the robot?  It's 2007.  There were TV shows where they had, like, do you know, Lost in Space was supposed to be,  I believe, take place in the 90s.  It was.  That was supposed to be the 90s, where they went into space in the Jupiter 2. 
[01:39:30]  They get lost, of course, in space.  And there's the robot.  And the robot did everything.  You know, the robot walked around, kept Dr. Smith from molesting Will.  It would do everything.  We don't have robots like that.  No, why?  Got nothing.  Because we know eventually the robot's going to attack us.  So why bother?  Fine.  They're going to attack us with their robot strength.  Robot army?  You don't have...  You have nothing compared to a robot, as far as the strength goes. 
[01:40:00]  Off switch.  What about that?  They got the intelligence thing, and they'll work around that, too.  Self-taught after a while.  How about an EMP?  From a nuclear blast.  Electromagnetic pulse.  Shuts them right down.  Yeah.  Shuts them right up.  Yeah, Lost in...  Stupid robots.  Lost in Space was set in the fine year of 1997.  In 1997, the Jupiter 2 took off for Alpha Centauri and got lost. 
[01:40:30]  Great.  Guess what we get in the year 2007?  Another space shuttle launch with a big, huge, freaking fuel tank on it.  The same thing.  No Jupiter 2.  The what?  The space shuttle.  Enduro.  Do you know it was built with parts of Enduro from Atlantis to replace the space shuttle  cylinder?  Challenger.  The space shuttle Enduro.  It's a really big shoe.  And now Topo Gigio is going to go on a special endeavor.  Special endeavor. 
[01:41:00]  I love the fact that Anthony is stuck between two worlds.  He wants a lot of technology, and he wants all this robot, and then on weekends, he puts  on a sword and goes into the woods.  I will be going to the Renaissance Festival.  You can find me tomorrow at the Renaissance Festival in Tuxedo, New York.  I will be going there.  And I am going to document it all on video and put it up on the web. 
[01:41:30]  Because that makes it cool, right?  It's going to be documented with video.  Do you have a velvet ruffled case for your iPhone?  No.  Oh, boy.  What do I do if I get a phone call?  You can't use your iPhone during a Renaissance.  Unless you found a little black hole and people from the future come in.  Oh, see.  You know what it is?  Sometimes at the Renaissance Festival, people just don't get it, and they come dressed in  like Star Trek uniforms.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Those people are stupid.  Have you seen the Endur?  The special Endur. 
[01:42:00]  Endur.  But, no, no, I want to, like, document it.  Because there's so many characters there that I really want to get that on tape.  There's some strange people there.  Will there be any LARPing going on?  Well, there's...  Two damage!  Two damage!  Two damage!  Oh, Jesus.  You scared me.  I almost cast a spell on you.  Watch out!  I'll cast a spell right on you if I'm scared.  Two damage, two damage. 
[01:42:30]  There's LARPing in that they put on displays of sword fighting and of...  And if you hit someone with a sword, it's two damage, right?  Well, it could be more.  It depends on what kind of sword you have.  I just got, like, a plastic sword you would, you know, get from, like, a young nephew or something.  That's fine, but you've got to give it kind of a name.  The Sword of Eternal Damnation or something.  And that would, you know, give you a real...  Ooh, ooh, ten damage.  Ten damage.  Really? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Two damage stinks.  What about the Sword of Gay?  The Sword of Gay.  You know where that goes for the most damage?  The Sword of Gay.  They ought to put that in, like, games like EverQuest and make it the most uber sword out there.  Like, in order to have the greatest sword, you have to wield the Sword of the Gay.  And you know what it's shaped like, and it has to say gay on it.  So you're like, God, this is tough, man.  I can have the Sword of Gay, but I'm not... 
[01:43:30]  It's just, it's kick-ass.  Right.  Like, it kills everything.  But it is the Sword of Gay.  The handle is just two peaches.  The Sword of Gay.  And you look really, like, swishy, wielding it.  You have to, like, your character does a stupid little dance, and he's nude.  Instead of pulling it out of a rock like Excalibur.  We know where you're going to pull it out of.  There you go.  We like to leave a...  We like to let the listeners do some of the lifting on this.  You can only equip the sword if your pants are off. 
[01:44:00]  You have to walk around with your character's pants off.  You know what?  That would be hilarious.  Why don't they do that?  It would be really fun.  The Sword of Gay.  So you're going to document the weirdos.  You.  Yes, yes, but I am going to infiltrate by also dressing in Renaissance.  So I go every year.  So you're not doing undercover work.  You're actually gay like the rest of them.  Yeah, I'm gay like the rest of them.  It's actually a good time. 
[01:44:30]  You're on the quest for the sword.  It's fun.  They have a guy.  I've got to be honest.  It's a good time.  I've gone to a couple over the years, and it's a good day out.  You drink your yard of mead.  What is it?  A yard of mead, sir.  Thank you.  Oh, oh, a tip from the gentleman.  Huzzah.  Huzzah.  Huh?  Two diamonds.  Two diamonds.  I'm casting spells.  You've been rooted.  You can't move.  But Opie has the Sword of Gay. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I'll back off.  Cast a chill spell on you and just freeze you for a while.  Watch it.  Hey, are you going to be watching any loot playing?  Oh, see?  That might do something I want to get on video.  Loot playing for an hour.  I'm just going to tape a guy playing the loot for an hour and then shoot myself.  Hey, Al down the hall wants to know if you're going to drive in costume to the Renaissance Festival. 
[01:45:30]  Well, that is probably something I won't be doing.  See, I'm not going to.  He's praying that you do and that you get pulled over.  Get pulled over.  Why, ye man of the law, what haveth I done wrong?  Have I insulted thee in some manner?  Back in the day, I don't remember the costumes anymore.  I've told this story a couple times on the radio over the years.  But one Halloween, I was driving into work at a radio station.  And there was a fender bender on the side of the highway.  And two people were going at it, really pissed off. 
[01:46:00]  But they were in silly Halloween costumes.  Because they were driving to some party or something.  It was two superheroes.  Duking it out.  It was hilarious.  No, it's a, you know, it's a whole event.  You see the jousting.  You buy little trinkets.  Do you want to buy a trinket?  Do you talk?  Do you have to talk with that?  No, I don't.  But the people that work there do.  And one time I said, excuse me, where are the restrooms? 
[01:46:30]  Restrooms?  Does thou wishest to take a rest?  I was like, no, I need the bathroom.  Oh, thou wantest to bathe?  I'm like, no.  I have to go.  He goes, oh, you are requesting the privy.  The privy.  I'm like, yeah, the port of privy.  That was built in 2000 and gets sucked out by a big truck that comes through.  Look at Anthony.  See, that's me on stage at the Halloween party in part of my costume with my rapier. 
[01:47:00]  I own a rapier.  See, look at that sword.  That's a real sword, my friend.  Is that a rapier?  That would kill you.  Is that a rapier?  That is a rapier.  That's pretty much the gay sword right there.  Why are you?  That is not the sword of the gay.  You've got the sword of the gay.  Look, I'm holding it up and the light is shining on me.  Yeah, you're holding the sword of gay with two hands, I see.  Let me tell you something.  That's how it makes the outfit makes it the sword of gay.  That's what I mean.  Why?  I'm dressed in authentic.  Look at your fat knees. 
[01:47:30]  Fat knees?  Thin boots.  I'm wearing.  Oh, he's wearing puffy pants.  They're puffy like.  They're like knickers.  I like that.  Knickers.  If you take that jacket off, you look like a Nazi with his coat off.  Oh, stop with the compliments.  They're not going to work now.  All right.  Hey, we've got to squeeze in more Mori-phobia thing stuff here show from what he did.  All right.  Travis pointed out that there are ATMs at the fair, so you can get ye money if you want 
[01:48:00]  to buy ye trinkets.  It is kind of weird seeing people dressed in costume, swiping their cards through an ATM machine.  I like going to the Renaissance fairs to see all the girls with their boobies way up.  Well, that's what they do.  Some of them look good.  A lot of them look awful.  They push these things.  They wear these, you know, they're cinched up in these bustier things that are really  cinched up tight, and their breasts sit like on top of them. 
[01:48:30]  Love it.  And then they're covered with this little light fabric dress thing, so they get pushed  into one breast in the middle.  Yeah, but here's the problem.  Some girls, they're kind of a bit on the sloppy side, but they've got big them.  They've got big'ums, and they push them way up.  Yeah.  And you feel like, remember back in the day, you used to play with, like, Mercury in class?  Yeah.  Like, she would move in the whole top of this thing.  It kind of sloshes over. 
[01:49:00]  It sloshes around.  Her flesh and being actually become slushy.  It's like a wave machine.  Yeah.  Well, that's a beautiful thing, because that's called being Rubenesque.  Like Ruben stuttered.  Yeah.  When you go to the ATM.  As close to Rubenesque as these broads are.  When you go to the ATM, do you pretend like it's a foreign thing?  Like, how do I use thee?  What is this?  Twice.  What is this?  How dost thou use it such a thing?  It must be the work of a wizard.  And then when money comes out, do you scream? 
[01:49:30]  Like, oh!  It's the work of a witch.  And then they come by and burn it.  It's amazing.  All right.  What kind of infernal machine is this?  I'm going to have to visit the wizard and see if he's responsible for such an infernal machine.  You should just do that character until they go, all right, we get it.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Like the hardest core guy tells me to shut up already.  All right, dude.  Listen, you're pissing me off, kid.  Enough, douche.  Dude, can you bring in your film and the whole thing?  Yes.  So you've got to bring in the tape so maybe we get some audio clips off. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  For Monday's show.  Absolutely.  You at the Renaissance Fair could be really fun.  I'll look authentic walking around with a high-def video camera, too.  Is that high-def-eth?  High-def-eth?  Wow.  It's just some things.  How could I be dressed up and carrying around a video camera?  That looks silly.  I'm going to have to camouflage it as something.  As what?  A turkey leg.  I have a camera staff.  Yes. 
[01:50:30]  Big tripod.  This is a prosumer camera.  See, it's better than consumer, but not quite professional.  I call it a prosumer camera.  My name is Prosumer.  I carry the gay sword.  I'm wielding the sword of gay.  I am wielding the sword of gay.  Look at my picture.  I am wielding.  It's wonderful.  I now have two swords, by the way.  I purchased another sword last year at the festival.  And I don't know which one to wield. 
[01:51:00]  Maybe I will dual wield.  Yeah.  But you know what's also kind of sad?  Like, you want to feel like you're badass with swords, like cool swords, like hanging from sword scabbards on your belt.  But when you walk in, they go, step this way, and they zip strip your swords into your sword sheath so you can't pull them out.  Why?  Because they don't want people having sword fights and killing each other.  It's not Westworld.  Yeah, but they're all carrying guns in their, you know, socks. 
[01:51:30]  Well, you just can't, like, pull out a sword and start clanking away with each other.  So they zip strip them into your scabbard.  Where's the fun in that?  None.  None fun.  Scion.  Yeah, you can't.  So the sword of the gay will stay in its sheath.  In honor of sword of the gay, can we play Sting doing that Lute song?  Oh.  Just a hook.  That's great.  Oh, stupid Lute.  That's the only reason the police got together, because he really thought the Lute thing was going to take off and realized how awful it was, 
[01:52:00]  and it wasn't being perceived by anyone as something they would want to listen to.  So then he's like, all right, time to call the boys up.  Axe throwing.  Yeah, yeah.  There's axe throwing and archery.  Yeah.  Oh.  Prove your manhood.  Bunch of corn on the cob eating homos you guys are.  Oh, here's a great one.  Eric in Newark.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, guys?  You're talking about the one up in Sloatsburg, New York, right?  No, it's in tuxedo, so I guess that's close enough, yeah.  Well, yeah, Sloatsburg tuxedo, what's the difference, you know? 
[01:52:30]  Well, I was wearing this outfit.  My wife had that outfit on, like you say, with the Boussier kind of deal in it.  Yeah.  I got a little hot and bothered, and there's this building that had a hay roof on it.  I took her behind the building with the hay roof, and I started calling her a wench.  We started acting out the whole thing, and we got caught.  I mentioned we got arrested for lewd and sexual act in public.  You couldn't resist?  We got arrested, bro.  We actually got arrested, locked up the whole mind.  That's how they had sex back in the day. 
[01:53:00]  In the dungeon.  I gave her the whole mind, so to speak, too.  That's what happened.  That's what happened.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  We got arrested at the Renaissance Festival.  All right.  To wrap up the Renaissance discussion, which was just terrific for everybody.  Yes.  Twas, twas.  Here's Sting playing some lute.  Just want to get to the part where he goes, ta-da.  Oh, come again, sweet love that thou invite thy graces that we friend. 
[01:53:30]  An app.  To do need you delight.  Here comes the hook.  To hear, to touch, to kiss, to die.  With me again, this is the same.  Oh, God.  How awful is that?  Let's play a real cool song.  Stephen Lynch doing his D&D song.  Yes.  We're going to break.  How's that sound for everybody?  Dungeons and Dragons song.  We'll continue with Opie and Anthony in just a bit. 
[01:54:00]  Let's get a little harmonica.  I'm sorry.  I got my 12-sided die and I'm ready to roll with a wizard and my goblin crew. 
[01:54:30]  My friends are coming over to my mom's basement bringing Funyuns in the Mountain Dew.  I got a big broad sword made out of cardboard and that stereo's a pumpin' Zeppelin.  It's that time of the night.  We turn on the black light.  Let the Dungeons and the Dragons begin.  It's D&D.  Fighting with the legends of yore.  It's D&D.  Never kissed a lady before.  Nope. 
[01:55:00]  Woo!  All right.  Take it home.  Take it home.  A little solo for it.  One more time.  Now the Lord of the Rings, the Dark Crystal and things.  We use these as a reference tool.  And when we put on our cloaks and tell warlock jokes, we're the coolest kids at the school.  No, we're not.  I know.  Now Tack's a real bastard, but a fair dungeon master.  He's got hit points and charisma to lend. 
[01:55:30]  And I rehearse in my room are what I call the Dragon's Tomb.  When I'm not out with my girlfriend, it's D&D.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got a girlfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  It's D&D.  Warriors who terrify.  It's D&D.  Virgins, till the day we... 
[01:56:00]  One, two, three, four.  Yeah!  Yeah.  The return of What the Hell is That to the Opie and Anthony show was an overnight success.  My God, this is awesome!  Who could forget the sounds of cysts being ruptured and Bob Kelly vomiting into a bucket?  Oh, Bob, he's...  Bob, he's puking.  Well, we're going down that pus-filled road again, kids. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ!  If you have a bump, boil, bruise, legion, pustule, cyst, inflammation, or otherwise unidentifiable oddity on your person,  then you're perfect for What the Hell is That?  See?  That's why the show's called What the Hell is That?  Email travis at foundrymusic.com with your ailment or freakish growth and your contact information,  and we'll have our crack team of medical professionals take a gander at it.  Break it all to the head!  And most likely giggle at it.  It's the return of the return of What the Hell is That? 
[01:57:00]  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  I can't explain how gross it is.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Tom Alive Friday.  We learned about an hour ago that Tom is indeed still alive.  Still chicken.  And next week, we're going to find out what his wish is, and we're going to make that come true.  To do this.  It's a wheezing.  It's also Boy and I Laugh Friday.  It's Mispronunciation Friday.

You can call up the F.U. line and vent.  See, we get to vent.  We have these microphones.  If we're mad about something, we vent.  And a lot of people get to hear it.  Right.  Most people don't get that liberty.  Does this song ever get to the part that I like?  No.  It's Luke just before the part I like. 
[01:58:00]  Let's go to the F.U. line and see what's going on today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  You have six new F.U.s.

The F.U. line.  Let's say hi to Rob in Brooklyn.  Rob, what's up?  What's going on, gentlemen?  How are you?  I'd like to send my, uh, pretty good.  I'd like to send my F.U. out to Anthony.  Yeah.  What'd I do?  For not liking phone call Thursdays.  There you go.  You can't give me an F.U. for not liking phone call Thursdays. 
[02:00:00]  Especially on a Friday.  Yeah, thank you, sir.  Point and laugh at you, sir.  Hey, speaking of, uh...  Anthony just pointed and laughed at that.  Did you, did you say point and laugh?  Yeah.  Because it is point and laugh Friday?  Of course it is.  We have a sweeper.  Of course.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:00:30]  It's point and laugh Friday.  Oh, my God.  What the hell was that?  It was creepy.  I thought it was more audio from Maury.  Maury.  Did you say sweeper?  Uh, no.  But what the hell?  Sweeper.  Yeah.  Speaking of sweepers, we got the official winky eye, uh, emotion sweeper. 
[02:01:00]  Emoticon.  Emoticon.  I say emotion.  It's mispronunciation Friday.  But I can still ha-ha point and laugh at you.  Oh, yeah.  Emoticon.  Winky eye.  Winky eye.  Winky eye.  Hey, can you put that in my machine?  Some of them are quicker than others.  Put that in my machine.  All right.  Let's do a little more Maury before we get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  Love the Maury.  We, uh, when we last left Maury, he was taunting a woman with a parrot. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  With a parakeet in a cage.  Yeah.  Because she was afraid of birds.  Yeah.  Not just afraid, like, oh, I don't like birds.  Like, ridiculous, insane, lost her mind, drooling, blithering idiot, afraid of birds.  Yes.  And, uh, Maury, uh, and some of these other talk show hosts that do this type of, uh, program,  uh, think that this is good.  Yeah.  That this is a way to cure, uh, who they're, um, oh, Jesus.  Okay. 
[02:02:00]  I'm looking at, uh, what, flight benefits?  Is that who you're looking at?  Yeah.  Flight benefits is, uh, topless every morning now.  She just, did you, are she putting pants on?  What the hell is she doing?  She just stopped us in the tracks.  She had her, she had her peonies on.  She had her little peonies on.  Yeah, she's hot.  Look at that.  She just sits there, her hair cascading over her breasts.  I'd punch my mother in the face to be with that right now.  Would you?  Now, hey, Mom.  Hi, Bobby.  Whack, why?  You know what?  That's the move right there.  You know what that look is right there? 
[02:02:30]  That's the look where you grab the panties by the top, and she gives a little hip lift.  And then, whoosh, they come right down.  That's right.  You know the hip lift?  That little, uh, that's when you know you're going to see some, uh.  No, I wasn't asking for it.  Oh, she just gave you the back and forth pointer finger.  No, I wasn't asking for it.  I'm just saying that the positioning you were taking on the bed there, Flight Benefits,  was the same one where the girl then gives the hip lift. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  So it was better to remove the panties.  Now she's putting a shirt on because I made her uncomfortable.  I ruined everything.  All right, can we get back to maybe doing some radio instead of watching Kyle talk?  Can I say philanthropist?  Why?  Because it's, uh, it's, uh, mispronounced.  What is it?  Oh, it sounds like a real word to me.  It is, philanthropist.  All right.  Maury.  Maury moves on and brings someone out on, um, out on stage that is afraid of cotton balls. 
[02:03:30]  Cotton balls.  What a dumb fear.  And I was thinking, I'm sitting here going, God, do we even play this one?  It's like cotton balls.  Who cares?  But Maury makes it interesting.  And, and something tells me that this fear of cotton balls because of the way she's afraid of it.  Yeah.  And the stories she has is a little more than just cotton balls she's afraid of.  Oh, really?  It just sounds to me like something may have happened in a, a closed room late at night at home.  The closet.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  When she had her homework due the next day and didn't get a good night's sleep because something happened.  I have a friend that's, uh, afraid of cotton.  Yeah.  He, he couldn't, uh, stand the, the, the, you know, touching cotton.  Yeah.  And the problem is he also likes to drink a lot.  Yeah.  And I was his roommate and he would be really hungover and he would beg me to open up a brand new, uh, aspirin, you know, bottles.  Then take the cotton out so he could, uh, take aspirin.  He could not touch cotton.  Are you kidding me?  Could not touch cotton.  Why not just, why not just hire a, a what? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, good Lord.  Let's go to the Maury audio.  Carolyn is afraid of cotton balls.  Shane and his fiancee Carolyn are here.  Shane says living with Carolyn's phobia has been nothing short of an emotional thrill ride.  You see, Carolyn is deathly afraid of cotton balls.  Why don't you laugh?  I'm laughing.  This is the funniest thing I've ever heard.  She's starting out real sympathetic there, Maury. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  Why don't you laugh at her?  Come on, everyone.  Laugh at her.  Come on.  It's point of life, Ronnie.  Laugh at her.  Laugh at her.  Laugh at her.  She's an idiot.  Come on.  Laugh at her.  It's a real fear for this broad, Maury.  He's asking the audience to laugh at her.  Right.  It's a real fear for this broad, Maury.  First of all, you know something?  You know what she says?  Cotton balls make a certain sound. 
[02:05:30]  You think so?  Yeah, they do.  Kind of.  If you have a cotton ball product, anything like that, Carolyn is fearful of everything.  Whoosh.  Now, she will explode in a fit of fear-fueled rage if she's approached with cotton.  So, what are you going to do, Maury?  Nightmares of a cotton ball man.  She has nightmares of a guy in cotton balls who attacks her.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  She got molested by a carny. 
[02:06:00]  Step right up, little girl.  Play the game.  Win a stuffed animal.  No.  Yeah, take that stuffed animal.  Cotton ball man.  Stop it.  You want it.  She was at a circus and all she wanted was some cotton candy.  She gets a nice, soft Roman war helmet.  Oh, my God.  Well, she has a nightmare of a cotton ball man. 
[02:06:30]  Well, she explains here.  I have a nightmare of a man who was made of cotton balls and he was trying to kill me by putting them in my mouth.  All right.  Hold on.  See, there's a problem right there.  This has nothing to do with cotton balls.  She has turned it into cotton balls.  This is a man that is made out of cotton balls that comes in and tries to kill her by choking her with shoving cotton balls in her mouth. 
[02:07:00]  That was actually his slave name.  Cotton balls.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Terrific.  This has nothing to do with cotton.  And more he's exploiting it, thinking it's a silly little thing.  Yeah.  A silly little fear, man.  This is stupid.  This is a lot deeper than...  Get every word that comes out.  He's trying to see cotton balls and he tries to kill me by putting them in my mouth.  Isn't this woman stupid? 
[02:07:30]  Come on, audience.  What a retarded idiot bitch this woman is.  Please kill me by putting them in my mouth.  You need a good deep...  A good deep...  We got to take the taste of cotton balls out of your mouth.  That's right.  Please kill me by putting them in my mouth.  And I've had this recurring dream for as long as I can remember. 
[02:08:00]  I have a one-year-old and he has toys that I can't even play with him with.  Or when I go to change his diaper, I'm scared that the cotton's going to come out of it.  I don't...  I don't want to deal with this anymore.  Take that baby away from this woman.  She's going to microwave it.  You'll beat me down.  I had to microwave the baby because the cotton balls told me to. 
[02:08:30]  Laugh at her.  Her baby's dead.  Goddamn, Maury.  Maury's the greatest.  Come on, put the baby in the microwave.  Do it.  She cooked her baby.  Cotton balls are driving her crazy.  But Maury thinks it's the funniest thing.  So what do we do?  Make sure the studio is clear of cotton balls, right?  No!  Bring on the cotton balls! 
[02:09:00]  What do you think Maury does?  Seriously.  Well...  He brought the bird out for the bird lady.  He's got...  I would say he just starts dropping cotton balls from the ceiling.  I hate...  You're not...  You wouldn't be a good writer for Maury.  No?  No.  I say he has a baby bow and arrow and he shoots Q-tips at her.  Is she just a little afraid of Q-tips?  Okay.  Kind of shake me up a little bit.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Makes her take Advil.  This is what Maury does. 
[02:09:30]  I got pictures of cotton.  Are you upset at those?  Pictures.  Yeah.  Tell me about this.  I thought that they're making that noise.  What noise?  They're just making the noise.  Cotton doesn't make a noise.  It does.  I got to find something.  Oh, God.  Wait a second.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Carol, don't go back there.  You're going to see more cotton than you want to see.  Don't go back there.  There's a lot of cotton back there. 
[02:10:00]  He's a sick F.  So he chases her backstage?  Around the studio to the cotton ball area that he had set up.  But how did he get her to run back there?  I think what had happened was she knew that he was going to get some cotton balls.  All right.  She didn't want to deal with it, so she went to run backstage.  And they had a cotton ambush set up.  There was something that was going to come out that she ended up running into.  You've been bushwhacked.  They surrounded the stage with cotton.  And, boy, Maury worked this out like a little plan. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  We'll get her in a pincer maneuver and funnel her into this area.  She won't be able to escape the cotton balls.  Oh, it gets better.  Here we go.  There's a lot of cotton back there.  Carol, come here.  No, no, no, no, don't do that.  I'm going to hit you.  Get back.  No, I'm going to hit you.  No. 
[02:11:00]  Get back.  Listen up, laugh.  He's laughing.  What's going on at this point?  Well, do you want us to give it away?  No, I think he explains.  Here we go.  Okay.  What is this?  No.  Get back.  What is this?  This is somebody who works for the show.  I guess.  Oh.  Leave this.  So what they had done.  Oh, no.  Was taken one of their staffers and completely covered him in cotton balls.  Oh, that cruel bastard. 
[02:11:30]  He's a genius.  So he looks like the Michelin man coming out just covered in cotton balls.  Was he walking like Frankenstein?  Yeah, he was just slowly lurking.  Yeah, like a zombie or something.  It's got to be scary.  So they actually created her nightmare.  Her nightmare.  The man that she dreams of that's going to come and kill her.  Yeah.  Oh, is that him?  For your enjoyment.  Is that him?  Yeah.  That's the guy.  I'm looking on YouTube.  He looks like.  Wow, that's creepy.  He looks like if he took like 100 cans of shaving cream and completely covered his body. 
[02:12:00]  Dude, and they're showing it in black and white and with that weird choppy thing.  It looks like a tool video.  That's like creepy.  It really is creepy.  Look at him.  Oh, no.  Dad, he's running away.  She's a big fat broad.  And by the way, just to shut up the instant feedback, it's a white broad.  It's a white broad.  Look at this guy.  All covered in cotton.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Go to YouTube.  A woman's scared of cotton balls.  There's your visual.  Well, I'm sure Al Dukes will add it to his show rundown today. 
[02:12:30]  If you go to 923krock.com and check out the Opie and Anthony page.  All right, here we go.  She's a big fat broad.  Here's white trash.  Here's the last part of the clip.  What is this?  Is this somebody who works for the show?  I can't believe this.  No, it's Cotton Man, idiot.  Who do you think it is?  All right, that's enough.  Free and free.  Move back, guys.  Move back.  Move back. 
[02:13:00]  Okay.  We got it.  We got it.  All right.  All right, go off.  Okay, we got it.  They all laugh.  Yeah, so it's okay?  You're traumatized there.  Is this someone that works for the show or the man from your nightmares?  Morrie is hysterically laughing and then tries to pretend that he's better than that.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, that's enough.  He's laughing his ass off and then, all right, get away.  Get away, Cotton Man.  We got it.  Douse him in lighter fluid and set him on fire.  Imagine if it's a serial killer and this is his thing, that he dresses himself in cotton 
[02:13:30]  balls and it's really not someone on Morrie's staff.  And it was just a ridiculous coincidence he showed up that day.  Morrie's guy is still in the green room putting cotton balls on.  That's ridiculous.  Who is this guy?  Does he work for the show?  I can't believe it.  Oh, oh my God.  I'm shot.  The Cotton Man is killing everybody.  Stupid Morrie. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  What does she do when it's her time?  I was just thinking about that.  Oh, wow.  She can't deal with the kid's diapers.  Right, right.  Great.  And he can't go the other way.  Good point.  Maybe the ancient way.  By the way, it is FU Friday.  CB from Atlanta is writing F YouTube.  That video is on break.com.  Search for Morrie Cotton and you'll get it.  Very good.  Morrie Cotton.  I just had to cut everyone off because we're real late.  We got to get out of here.  Yep.  All right.

[02:21:00]  yep  DJ I was about  to say you're crazy  but now you got  me a little  worried  back in the  day  who was that  guy  it was Tom  or something  Stucker Patty  was homeless  I don't remember  the guy's name  but he was a  little weird  and you know  the cops went  over and checked  him out  and that kind  of shit  yeah  what  oh it was  Eddie  Eddie the  murderer  Eddie the  murderer  that got  really really  creepy  we had  camera crews  showing up  at our station  we had  detectives  showing up  at our station  and taking  us into  closed rooms  and separating  us  and interrogating 
[02:21:30]  us  it got  scary  and then  they went  over to  his house  and realized  this guy  could have  never murdered  anyone  and they  never explained  why they  came to that  conclusion  just some  kooky guy  kooky guy  that showed up  at the door  in his underwear  or something  and still lives  with his mom  said it was a  drug deal  gone bad  back in the  70s  70s  he was in  some warehouse  yeah  he killed  somebody  and then  poured gas  on him  and burnt  the body  right  right  right  and it  got a lot  of attention 
[02:22:00]  here in  New York  huh  we got  Eddie's laugh  we got  Eddie's laugh  really  how do you  got Eddie's  laugh  C-Rock  it's isolated  here we go  this is  Eddie's laugh  from back  in the day  wow he could  be on  that's a  maniacal laugh  Eddie's laugh  laugh  well we got  Fast Freddy  from Jamaica  Station  I mean he's  a faithful 
[02:22:30]  listener to  this show  he goes  Tom is not  Eddie the  murderer  not even  close  it's something  to think  about though  do we have  him talking  yeah it's  that same  weird speech  impediment he  has and that  kind of thing  I could be  wrong but it  just sounds  very funny  I think you  are sir  we're going  to definitely  look into it  a little bit  further  alright  thank you  DJ  make us  second guess  things  why you  and that bit  came out of  nowhere anyway  so  we didn't  really set  that up  it just 
[02:23:00]  came about  naturally  alright  to Kid  Rock  Kid Rock  is confusing  the hell out  of everybody  he just  released his  latest single  yeah  and  when you think  Kid Rock  what do you  think  I think  a little of  that rock  rap  rock  rock  rap  he realizes  that rock  rap isn't  too popular  these days  so he's not  doing that  but then he  did a little  country  yeah he did 
[02:23:30]  he did a couple  of duets  he's not doing  country  no  now he's got  some kind of  now he's just  decided to be a  classic rock  artist  he has that  kind of  classic rock  you know  over the top  guitar sound  yeah  with his latest  song called  So Hot  but it's got  like a southern  rock  a little bit  maybe a little bit  to it  a little  yeah he's  going big  guitars here  you want to  listen to this  or what  a little bit  alright  it's Kid Rock  So Hot  it's Big Bottom 
[02:24:00]  yeah this is  like  70's music  by the way 
[02:24:30]  Chris from  Monroe  Monroe  they decided  that Eddie  couldn't have  done anything  because when  they went to  his door  I forgot about  this  he was wearing  just a Giants  jersey  that was it  and he had  our NEW number  written everywhere  in his hole  of an apartment  nice  it was written  all over the  place like  beautiful minds  yeah  it was nuts  and tiny little  writing everywhere  on little receipts  packed to the wall 
[02:25:00]  yeah  Kid Rock  so hot  are you ready  a little rock  scream there  it's coming in 
[02:25:30]  she was shaking  Kid Rock  Kid Rock  equals  the new  Eddie  money  that's from  Klaus  from Paul  that song  does kind of  the intro  there  sounds like  a few songs  and a lot  of people  saying  a little  ACDC  as well  I have a  clip of  Eddie  it starts  right after  he says  he'll take  in  Stalker  Patty  alright  let's listen  to this  Eddie  the murderer  the crap  I did  all my life  maybe this  will give  me a gold  star  to get up  to heaven  you know  something  it might  what's  some of  the crap  you did  in your life  there  Eddie  I don't

[02:39:00]  me douchebags  and danny  bonaduce is half  assedly trying to  stick up for you  do you want to  hear the audio  yeah let's hear it  probably because  me and howard  stern get along  right  right howard  stern gets along  with nobody on  the air i mean  look he's the  he's the tip of  this era he's the  leader of the past  hating anybody i'm  not going to try to  defend stern  he hates everybody  who's on the air  everyone's on the  air hates him  i magically get  along with stern  i don't know why  he decided not to  hate me probably  because i was on  at night not on 
[02:39:30]  in the morning  and now maybe  people hate me  because they hate  him and what  have you  well it has  nothing to do  with  more lies from  radio guys  more lies  i made my opinion  because i ran into  him in la and he  was a complete  douche to me  and the reason he  was a douche  because he is  friends with  howard so he  felt like  well i know  howard hates  opian anthony  so i gotta not  acknowledge this  guy  fucking liars  in this stupid  business  and his audience  will believe  whatever the fuck 
[02:40:00]  he says  i had no opinion  on adam carolla  until i was out  in la and i went  by his love lines  with uh with our  agent who just  happens to be the  agent of adam  carolla he goes  you want to stop  by love lines i'm  like yeah you know  what i think that  love lines is a  pretty good show i  would love to check  it out live i have  nothing better to do  i go there i sit in  another room he's  doing a show through  a glass fucking  booth i'm sitting  on a fucking couch  he's eyeing me the  whole time like what  the fuck drew could  care less they go to  break drew comes out  and says hey nice to  meet you adam carolla  looks at me in the 
[02:40:30]  eyes and goes what are  you doing here and  walks out and has a  smoke that's where  this comes from you  fucking asshole i'm  so sick of radio guys  lying i had no opinion  on you until i met you  and then i made my  opinion had nothing to  do with howard stern  you douche  fucking i fucking hate  this business i really  do well i love doing  radio with anthony and  jimmy and everybody  else but besides that  this business is filled 
[02:41:00]  with fucking liars  brit why are you  bringing howard into  this it has nothing to  do with howard i met  you and you were a  complete douche bag  he's got to speculate  that it's because he  gets along with howard  who gives a shit who  gives a shit if you  get it's like he's  tooting his own horn  who cares holy shit  send this fucking audio  over to fmqb so we get  the real the word out i 
[02:41:30]  had no opinion of uh  about adam carolla except  that the love line show  that he did with drew was  pretty interesting and i i  kind of liked uh listening  to it every once in a  while and i had the  opportunity to go check it  out live and i did i  didn't i didn't even i  even knew that he was  friends with howard i  didn't give a shit and  the guy blew me off which  is fine i i'm just  telling the story on the  air i didn't need him  to like me i didn't need  him to talk to me i'm  just telling people what  happened i couldn't even  have told you he was  friends with howard i i 
[02:42:00]  so like wouldn't even  care about something like  that like i i had no  idea i just don't find  the guy very compelling  uh when him and and  jimmy kimmel did the man  show that was interesting  you know i had some funny  episodes and stuff like  that but uh i don't find  him interesting or  compelling or anything or  funny to be completely  honest with you he's a  he's a bore by himself on  radio and that's why they  had to bring in danny uh  bonaduce to inject some  energy into the fucking 
[02:42:30]  program the show sucked the  ratings sucked and they  needed to jump start the  show they realized it needs  some energy because when you  do morning radio you need  to be a little peppy yeah  that all slow delivery  thing that dry monotone  delivery doesn't work in  the morning fucking  asshole stop fucking lying  they can't they can't help  it i made my my whole  opinion on the fact that i  went out there and he  goes what are you doing  here he was all bothered  because i was uh you know 
[02:43:00]  there yeah that's all and  i don't need adam carolla to  like me i'm just telling the  fucking story the day you  need an adam carolla to  like you but then he goes  on the air and has to you  know pull howard stern into  it you're a fucking loser  dude you're a loser just like  everyone else you wanted to  be the next howard and you  couldn't do it so now you got  to kiss his ass guess what  aunt and i did our own  fucking thing and we didn't  have to kiss anyone's ass to  do it you fuck look where  we're sitting  hey obi yeah and i'm doing 
[02:43:30]  this rant from howard's old  seat you fuck how does that  make you feel you fuck  there's one thing i swear to  god man you know there's one  thing that bothers me is when  fucking radio guys lie through  their fucking teeth there's  another video out there of  man cow uh shooting trash on  fox oh my god fucking host  don't even call him out on it  or call us and say what's the  deal with this man cow goes  on tv find me the fucking 
[02:44:00]  man cow clip this is one of  the biggest liars in radio is  is man cow and he gets on and  tries to come up with an  excuse why he isn't doing uh  imus's slot when imus got  fired uh oh it has nothing to  do with his lack of talent lack  of markets lack of ratings lack  of personality lack of anybody  that in the business that likes  him or respects him or  appreciates him it had to do  with us it was our fault and 
[02:44:30]  the company's fault why they  didn't put him in the imus uh  slot over at the fan here in  new york it's the it's the one  thing that'll that'll just get my  blood boiling is this this right  here jocks that lie and no one  that calls him out on it fucking  lie through your teeth you know i  talked to bob our our agent about  mankind goes oh yeah this has been  his his thing ever since i had  known him that he'll just lie and  and say whatever the fuck he 
[02:45:00]  wants because he knows no one's  gonna the fact check no one will  call him out on it this company  doesn't want fucking man cow to do  imus's old slot that's that's as  simple as it gets but he's claiming  because he uh he didn't stick up for  us through the through the through  the last uh problem we went through  that's the reason why they decided  not to have him do a week are you  kidding me and then he goes i lost  money on hotels and flights because  of those guys the company didn't give  a shit who or who didn't stick up for  us through that believe me they did 
[02:45:30]  not give a flying fuck who was  supporting us or who was bashing us  on the air and here's something too by  the way uh there was a time that  howard actually wanted anthony and i on  his uh show after the whole sex for  sam thing we said no we had no  fucking interest no fucking interest  okay luke what do you got what else  is he saying  uh they're on commercial right now  actually  what a fucking liar  i only got one thing to say to him 
[02:46:00]  frankis  yes frankis indeed my friend well we'll  put you on hold if anything else is  going on we'll go to you someone  monitor luke for a minute or two  thanks luke i really appreciate  actually  god it's so stupid where's the man  cock audio  oh it's coming and i even you know i  even took back kind of what i said  about bonaduce because i felt like  but uh you know you set me straight on 
[02:46:30]  that one we try to get we try to keep  it fair on the show we really do yeah i  really thought that bonaduce bonaduce  ducci was uh was trashing us when we  went through our problem and it turns  out that anthony saw it a different  way and then i listened to anthony i'm  like all right i think you're right  yeah i think it was uh yeah i think he  he didn't really bash us and by the  way adam howard likes guys that uh he  feels aren't competition you loser that's 
[02:47:00]  it that's why howard always had a problem  with us we were doing real well right in  his backyard that's the real reason why  he hated us he knew at some point he  knew you were a softy so of course of  course regardless of the situation he  knew at some point we'd be sitting in  these seats you know it was just the  way it was going to happen no matter how  many times we fucked up and he has to get  his old friend jimmy kimmel to you know  help with his uh fucking la show yeah  you're gonna keep relying on jimmy kimmel 
[02:47:30]  keep relying on jimmy kimmel oh i'd be i'd be  proud of what i do that's gotta hurt just  keep relying on jimmy kimmel right  douche you're a fucking loser  yeah good morning well the reason the  reason why is because you know yeah  everyone has to hate howard and because  i'm friends with howard they have to hate  me too they have to hate me too  yeah they have to hate me too i guess 
[02:48:00]  because i was friends with howard and i  guess because i uh i wasn't in morning i  was doing nights that's why howard didn't  hate me he didn't hate you because he  he knows you're a softy and you were no  threat and you know that douche you know  that  where's the man cow love it watch me pop a  blood vessel where's man cow shit let's  go down this road 
[02:48:30]  watch him we can play from here all right  lie listen to this horse shit and the and  what bothers me the most look at man cow  wants to spew his shit whatever but  there's not one fucking host that is  gonna go whoa man cow this sounds  completely ridiculous call him out on  it well they was sort of did but then  one guy repeats what he says as if it's  like wait a minute what you're saying is  you didn't get the job because of this  reason and man cow gets all tripped up 
[02:49:00]  he's like well i don't don't get me in  trouble here right right like he's saying  something he's not supposed to be  saying no one's calling man cow from from  this company it just isn't happening he's  not going over to the fan he never was  they weren't gonna try him out for a week  the guy the guy is just full of shit right  and here's a little uh little little tease  for everybody wait to hear how much of a  baby man cow is there's today's opiate  anthony tease wait to hear it's coming soon 
[02:49:30]  trust me but this one man cow had to say  on what that fox fox they kiss his ass  over there go ahead you're gonna be here  today originally we're supposed to be in  new york i wish you would have brought  that up but since we did well i guys i got  to tell you you know what people like us  and all foxes is is is uh you know fair  and balanced haha i will tell you something  i've worked here for years i've never had  anyone tell me what to say ever and yet it's  just so amazing it's such i i work for emma's

[02:51:30]  idiot a stage why i don't know why  shit another guy full of shit that is the  biggest load of crap like he was coming  in to do a week on the fan it wasn't  happening it was not happening i guess he  came in did he do something on broadway  did he do a walk-on on the radio broadway  show that's going on i don't know idea i 
[02:52:00]  mean this clips a couple months i saw  jerry springer in rocky horror on  broadway once so maybe they were  bringing him in like that you know one  of those uh little cameo by a radio  dickhead oh is he the worst i don't  work for the company because i wouldn't  support the rape of god shut up first of  all it was supporting like uh do you  really want to get into it what the 
[02:52:30]  situation was we all know what happened  that day it had nothing to do with uh if  if you were supporting our show that had  nothing to do with supporting the rape  of anybody that wasn't supporting the  rape of any woman  uh condoleezza rice or or the first lady  or anything by by supporting our show  after that incident happened that had  nothing to do with supporting rape  you douchebag 
[02:53:00]  the guy turned it around like like like  there was a rape committed and he  wasn't supporting a rape what a fucking  dick god i hate that guy sean hannity  support us by saying he doesn't really  agree with what we did that day you  know we really didn't do much that day  it was a homeless guy but sean's just  like some hate right yes i guess sean  hannity supports a rape but he  understands the bigger issue that you 
[02:53:30]  should be able to say pretty much  whatever you want on a radio show  especially one that that uh you know  people have to pay for he's uh without  getting into it because you know it's a  touchy situation yeah that's that's  what sean hannity said no matter what no  matter what you think of what happened  no one was raped all right can i can i  fucking say that no one was raped that  day uh on our show and we didn't talk  about anybody that was raped so for him
