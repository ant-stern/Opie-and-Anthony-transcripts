<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their morning commutes and musical preferences, ranging from Led Zeppelin and Grand Funk Railroad to Nine Inch Nails and jam bands like Fish and Lettuce.  They debated the merits of various song covers, particularly Johnny Cash's rendition of "Hurt."  A significant portion was dedicated to the San Diego Mayor Bob Filner sexual harassment scandal, featuring sexually explicit and offensive commentary on photos of the alleged victims. Caller Jillian contributed to this discussion and suggested a Fish cover.  The show also covered Richie Sambora's firing from Bon Jovi and a Canadian dentist's possession of John Lennon's tooth and his plan to clone him, leading to a broader discussion on cloning.  Bruce Springsteen's "She's the One" was played, and an upcoming Metallica concert was briefly mentioned.  The hosts consistently used vulgar language and engaged in sexually explicit and offensive humor.

The Metallica concert announcement, prematurely revealed by a tip from their contact Roland, became a major plot point. Roland's escalating panic, conveyed through increasingly frantic texts, was a central feature of this segment.  The hosts' continued discussion of the concert despite Roland's pleas fueled the situation, with the story rapidly spreading across news outlets like ABC News and TMZ.  Roland's fear of repercussions and his pleas to remove previous mentions from replays highlighted his distress.  The segment culminated with Roland arriving at the studio, visibly distraught, after the hosts revealed the information was already public knowledge. The ensuing discussion covered potential consequences for the hosts and transitioned into discussions about Jimmy's upcoming comedy tour and the planning for the annual "Jocktober" segment.

The "Jocktober" planning segment featured guest Denny Morris, a radio personality. The discussion encompassed the nature of radio, pranks, and the personalities of various radio hosts.  Morris shared anecdotes from his radio career, including a prank gone wrong and a memorable incident at a college radio convention involving a "mushy marijuana cigarette."  The conversation shifted to a new song by intern Sean B., critical of Opie, sparking a debate about the appropriateness of such material on the air and the practice of radio editing.  A call from Jim Norton followed, heavily promoting his new Epix comedy special, "American Degenerate," detailing its content and sharing his views on various controversial topics, including rape jokes, the media's reporting on race, and the Anthony Weiner scandal. The conversation also touched upon past interactions with Free Beer and Hot Wings and concluded with further discussion of Norton's special and a brief mention of an audio clip about a flatulence protest.


A segment focusing on online reactions to the hosts' opinions explored their experiences with negative feedback and online harassment.  Jim Norton joined the discussion in the studio, sharing his experiences with media bias in reporting on racial issues.  He further discussed his comedy special and views on media handling of news stories.  The conversation then took a bizarre turn with an extended discussion about Penthouse Pet of the Year Nicole Aniston, who was a guest. The hosts spent considerable time examining photos from her pictorial, making frequent sexually explicit remarks and jokes.  The discussion included commentary on photoshopping, sleep habits, lingerie preferences, and online dating experiences, all laced with profanity and crude humor.

Further discussion with Nicole Aniston explored her physique, dental work, and childhood food memories. This segment contrasted the humorous farewell to male intern Tyler (presented with a half-eaten muffin and pretzel rod) with the more elaborate farewells given to previous female interns.  The Metallica concert mishap featuring Roland and his panic was revisited, with details on his conversations with colleagues and their reactions.  Sam Roberts, the after-show host, recounted his travel woes and panic attack, leading to discussions about sleep problems, the movie "The World's End," and listener calls.

The final segment included Sam Roberts, Eric Nagel, and Ryan. The conversation revolved around Sam's experiences with professional wrestlers, particularly a negative encounter with Virgil and a positive one with the Ultimate Warrior.  Sam discussed his ambitions for an independent radio show and his frustrations with his current after-show role. A listener's question about Mick Foley and a Reddit AMA regarding a steak-feeding incident was addressed. The segment concluded with a Steven Singer Jewelers advertisement, a call from Rich praising Sam's work and suggesting a potential timeslot change,  and the show's ending. The segment was filled with informal banter and the frequent use of expletives.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:00:30]  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in eight every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  Why doesn't it smell too bad?  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gone, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  First laugh of the morning.  What's up, everyone?  Hi.  Welcome to this horse shit. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Oh.  That's nice.  People are on the edge of their seats right now.  Yeah.  Wondering what I listened to on the way in today.  Are they?  Yeah, they're on the edge of their seats.  They tweet me all the time.  They're like, oh my God, I can't wait till...  Edge of their seats?  I can't wait till sort of 6 a.m.  Let's call it sort of 6 a.m. 
[00:02:30]  Because I want to know what you listen to on the way in.  Oh, man.  Now that you're driving about 90 minutes each way.  Mm-hmm.  They're on the edge of their seat.  Oh, yeah.  Why wouldn't they be?  Sure.  There's nothing going on on the SiriusXM thing today.  Yeah, not much.  I noticed that I kind of miss DJs.  Ah.  I'm a corporate guy now.  Scott Greenstein begged me to be a corporate guy.  So that's what I'm doing for everybody now.  So I'm spinning the old satellite radio dial. 
[00:03:00]  Sampling the channels.  I'm sampling the channels, yes.  Yeah.  Heard a little Gallows Pole today by Zeppelin.  Oh, right.  I tried to sing that song really loud, and I realized I don't really know many of the  words.  You know, you're alone in the car, though.  It doesn't matter.  I'm going to take myself.  I'm really good at, like, every other word when I sing a song.  Yeah?  It's pretty pathetic, because I did music radio for many years.  You would think I would know every single fucking word.  I don't.  You just put it in your head, though, especially Zeppelin songs like that. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  You don't really know the words, so you just make up, like, the sounds and the words.  I know the hangman part.  Hangman!  Hangman!  So I was really screaming that out.  Oh, wow.  And then it went into the next, like, you know, fucking words.  The next words.  And I realized, I'm like, hangman, hangman.  Then it was Grand Funk Railroad, Some Kind of Wonderful.  I'm like, oh, I know this one.  Some kind of wonderful. 
[00:04:00]  I don't need a whole lot of money.  Right.  And then, I don't need a big, big, fine car.  All right, I know that part.  And then, wow, things are being thrown around in this studio.  Oh, no.  It's always something.  Everything that I've seen a man can have.  But I got more than I can ask for.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[00:04:30]  Yep.  This is one of those that you leave on your radio when it comes down.  Because I got me a sweet, sweet, loving woman.  See, I'm a little behind.  How to treat me right.  My baby, she's all right.  My baby, clean out of sight.  Don't you know that she's some kind of wonderful.  All right, I got this one.  Yeah, I got this one.  I'll do this one.  All right.  All right.  No, no.  She's some kind of wonderful. 
[00:05:00]  And then I was listening to Nine Inch Nails' Hurt.  Holy fuck, is that a great song.  And I know I'm not.  Blown in.  I don't like that version as much.  That's a Johnny Cash.  Johnny Cash.  It's hard for me to like that version.  Really?  Johnny Cash blew that song out of the water where it's almost hard to listen to Nine Inch Nails' version, to be honest with you.  Oh, I don't know.  Trent Reznor really fucking whispers through that song.  Oscar award winner Trent Reznor.  Oscar award winner Trent Reznor.  Yes.  And at 4.30 to 4.40 in the morning, it's kind of creepy to hear him whispering through that song. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I kind of like that.  Oh.  Oh, man.  I hurt.  Were you looking like out into the darkness?  Oh, yeah.  There's fog.  Oh, man.  This is creepy.  Waiting for the lights to be on the LIE.  Yeah.  I'm on that stretch of road where there's no lights because they're like, yeah, no one lives out this way.  Oh, that's scary.  And then you finally hit the lights and go, okay, civilization.  Nice.  Oh, man.  Creepy.  The line about everyone goes away in the end or whatever.  Holy fuck.  And then you just think Johnny Cash's version as you're hearing this. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And then I was thinking to myself, is it the greatest cover ever?  Johnny Cash doing Hurt.  I think so.  That's way the fuck up there.  Remember we looked at that list of covers that was the best covers ever, and they gave it to Shine Down for Simple Man, which is fucking amazing.  But I still put Hurt over that.  Hurt is the fuck up there.  Yeah.  Someone tried to turn me on to a fish yesterday by sending me, it's like, dude, you gotta hear fish do while my guitar gently weeps. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, nice.  And they did, no.  No?  I was like, I was like, all right, I'll give it a listen.  I'll give the seven-minute version a listen.  Oh, that's a short song.  And, yeah.  And the guys, the singer's voice is so weak.  Like, it's so fucking weak.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, and this isn't like a rock, you gotta belt it out song, but the vocal has gotta be strong.  Yeah.  You know?  And dynamic.  It's this thin, listen to his dumb voice. 
[00:07:00]  It's weak.  I don't mind it so far, to be totally honest with you.  You know, I don't mind it, but it's not like, wow.  It's such a great song, how can you fuck it up?  I'm not getting blown away.  Right.  And I see it needs sweeping.  He's just running through the motions. 
[00:07:30]  You know, like this.  Like I said, it's not bad, but he's just running through the motions of the song.  But it's not spectacular.  Oh, that part sucks.  That part's okay.  You pick up on every word.  Yeah, it is kind of a weaker voice.  I hear the weakness.  It's a little thin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, relax, because the jam people are really pissed at us.  We're making the jam boards.  We're making the jam message boards.  Jam boards. 
[00:08:00]  We're making the jam message boards.  Are they a little more calm than the cake boards?  Way calmer.  They're calmer than the cake boards?  But the people that are fans of, like, Fish and Us, they get it.  They get that the jokes are there.  But then you got the hardcore fans really not happy.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're making fun of Fish and the Grateful Dead.  Here's the boring.  Yeah.  I need you guys to do a song that's under 40 minutes.  Yeah.  Put a little oomph into it. 
[00:08:30]  I went to the Dead Channel.  Oh.  They did a little trucking.  Oh, God.  And it was all the trucking part that you like.  And then a little, you know, they're fooling around a little bit.  A little noodling.  They're a little noodling.  And then three minutes later, I'm like, all right, enough with the noodling.  And I moved on.  Yeah.  I moved on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I went to the Jam Channel, and there was a band on called, Are You Ready For This?  What?  And people out there are going to go, they know the band, but we don't.  Yeah.  I was listening to a band called Lettuce. 
[00:09:00]  Lettuce.  Like, not let us.  Lettuce.  Lettuce.  As in, get me the fucking, you know, vinegar and oil.  Oh, God.  Lettuce.  Was jamming out this morning.  Lettuce.  And what is that like?  I don't know.  It was really fucking weird.  Was it jammy?  Yeah, of course.  It was on the jam station.  Man, that sounds terrible.  I was thinking that the person that programs the jam station has the easiest job ever. 
[00:09:30]  It's like two songs an hour.  Right?  That's all he has to worry about.  Wow.  That is fucking...  Tops.  That is easy.  Maybe three.  Maybe you could squeeze three jam songs on in an hour.  Damn.  So, and then, um, the song of the morning, though, was, uh, Roland would be proud.  Oh.  Well, Bruce?  Yes.  That fucking song, She's the One, is such a great fucking song.  Yeah?  Which one is that?  Oh, you know it.  It builds, too. 
[00:10:00]  And then I see the front page of the Daily News, and it says, She's the One.  How weird is that?  Oh, ooh.  Because they're, uh, endorsing, uh, that Quinbrood.  Of course they are.  Endorsing the Quinbrood for the New York City mayor.  How does the paper endorse people?  I don't know.  How can you give unbiased news if you're promoting one candidate?  You're absolutely right.  It's ridiculous to have an endorsement of a candidate from a newspaper.  Oh, we're, you know, we're balanced.  We're not biased.  We're not...  But we want this person to win because of their political, uh, fucking ideology. 
[00:10:30]  Uh, yeah.  I think if she does win, um, it's just New York will edge a little further into, uh, the abyss that it used to be.  Um, I don't think she's tough enough for this city.  I don't think she is either.  She's way liberal.  Way liberal.  And, um, I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm not feeling it.  I liked, I liked having a guy.  You need a strong guy in there.  Yeah.  Even Bloomberg is an asshole and shit, but, you know, he doesn't take much guff.  No.  And, uh, Giuliani, of course, very strong, powerful mayor, uh, did a lot of things people didn't like. 
[00:11:00]  But, you know, if, if you want a city to be safe and make money and be a prosperous city, you need a guy like that in there.  I don't see as how she is really going to be tough where she needs to be and, and, um, uh, strong and tell her, sometimes tell her constituency, no, we, we got to do this for the good of the city.  And not just because some fucking hairy armpitted hippie broad wants to, uh, you know, save a tree or something.  Right.  We'll see what happens. 
[00:11:30]  And Wiener's out of it, I guess.  Is he?  I think so.  Is he moving up in the polls at all?  Uh, he was in the debate.  He was, yeah.  Yeah.  They had a little debate, I guess.  Yeah.  Good for them.  Good for them.  What does this have to do with lettuce?  I don't know.  I, we didn't hear any lettuce.  Do you want to hear lettuce?  Does Iraq have any lettuce?  That's like a joke waiting to happen.  Oh, Madison Square.  What?  What is this?  Lettuce.  Madison Square.  Madison Square. 
[00:12:00]  Madison Square.  Madison Square.  They have horns?  All right.  This sounds like action movie shit.  Like 80s action movies.  Holy shit.  Look.  Axel Foley's in a truck.  He's fucking driving.  Holy shit.  The lethal weapon guys are fucking ready to take someone down.  Chris Tucker. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  Chris Tucker.  Let's name them all.  I'm not feeling this.  This sounds like movie soundtrack shit.  This is not what I heard.  This is an old episode of Mannix.  Yeah.  Hear that building?  Yeah.  How long does this go on for?  You've still got another five minutes.  Oh.  That's a short song.  You know what?  This is different though than like the dead or fish type jamming.  What about the string cheese incident?  What?  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  He doesn't know about the string cheese incident.  Oh God, yeah.  They're famous.  They're really famous.  They're a band, right?  Yeah.  What do you got?  You rock?  On the string cheese.  What were they named after?  This is a different Lettuce song.  I switched it up.  Oh.  Yeah, they got a funk thing to them.  I don't mind them.  Got some horns.  Yeah, I don't feel that guttural hatred that I usually feel when these songs come on sometimes.  Oh, you would have hated the version of Truckin' today. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, I'm sure.  It was going well.  It was from like 1979.  Wow.  I'm like, all right.  Feeling it.  And they were singing about all the towns and everything was good.  Oh, great.  And then, as you'd call it, they started the noodling.  Just noodling at your expense.  Maybe this will be a short noodling and they'll go back into the chorus.  Never.  I don't know what happened because I had to move on.  And then Elvis.  The Elvis Channel, they weren't doing their stories today.  Just playing Elvis? 
[00:14:00]  You shamed them.  They were playing that Hallelujah song, which is an amazing.  Hallelujah.  Glory.  Hallelujah.  Holy fuck.  Is that epic?  Kids say epic still, right?  Sam?  Epic.  Yeah, it's still right.  Jim Norton is on Epics.  Jim Norton will be on Epics tomorrow night.  Yes.  And I'm epic.  And you're epic.  You sure are.  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  Glory, glory.  Hallelujah. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  And it just builds.  And then when you think Elvis can't build the song anymore, he keeps building and  building.  It's amazing.  Holy fuck.  It makes you want to jerk off in the car.  Wow.  Oops.  Whoops.  I mean.  Let that little tidbit slip.  Oops.  Whoopsie.  And then on the pad date it said, blah, blah, whoever the blah, blah guy is.  Uh-huh.  His memories of Elvis from 2008.  Oh, boy.  So they're replaying someone's memories that he talked about back in 2008. 
[00:15:00]  So I guess what he had, uh...  I don't know.  They didn't go to the stories.  Yeah.  Because they were too busy with the hallelujah thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would they even announce that?  If it's just memories, it's not like anybody would know.  Like, if you didn't say this is from 2008, people would say, oh, look at this.  It's brand new memories.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But they're not brand new memories.  It's some dude they interviewed back in 2008, and they thought his memories were so damn good,  they had to replay it in 2013.  This one was about yellow coats.  Right. 
[00:15:30]  Everyone's saying you've got to hear fish.  Well, not everyone.  Just one guy.  Everyone.  I got caught.  Actually, it's not even a guy.  Jillian.  Hold on.  We love when the females call, which is very rare.  It's probably a guy named Jillian.  Oh, please, no.  Let's say hi to Jillian.  What's up, Jillian?  You've been in San Diego.  Have you been groped by the mayor of San Diego?  No, I have not.  Oh, man.  You must be hot, then.  He loves pigs.  Oh, he goes for the pigs? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Really?  They're not even good-looking?  Jesus.  How do you have been a minute?  You guys go for the pig joke, ready?  Well, if you're going to blow up...  Hold on.  If you're going to blow up your career, you've got to make sure they're not pigs.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  It's disgusting.  If you've ever looked at him, I mean, who would?  Who would fuck him?  Yeah.  What are you doing up so early?  Oh, I was up drinking all night.  All right.  I hear it in your voice.  You and David Cassidy.  Nice.  That's nice.  Did you go home with anyone?  No, I did not. 
[00:16:30]  What's wrong with you?  Come on.  Get out there.  Really?  Spread them rigors.  Anyway, you guys need to listen to Fish Covering No Quarter.  Huh?  You need to listen to Fish Covering No Quarter.  Really?  Oh, yeah?  That's one of the broads he sexually harassed?  Oh, yeah.  That thing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Hold on, Julia.  It's a Mr. Potato Head.  What the fuck?  Peggy, she's a 67-year-old great-grandmother.  Peggy, they spelled it wrong.  She faced continuous inappropriate sexual advances by Filner while she was just trying to do 
[00:17:00]  her job.  How long did it last?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  She looks like that.  Can I say something that's not popular?  Sure.  If I was a broad and I looked like that, I'm just saying that I wouldn't mind a few gropes.  All right.  Is that bad to say?  No, you know what? 
[00:17:30]  If I was a broad and looked like that, I would welcome some groping.  Everyone likes to feel like they're wanted and attractive, even an old great-grandmother  like that.  67 years old.  And if some guy is groping you, you know, it depends on how bad the grope is.  All I'm saying is I would be flattered if I was a broad and I looked like that.  You're saying if that big fat lady was homeless, you'd jump on her scale.  Oh, little Jimmy's there.  Hi, little Jimmy.  Good evening.  I'm not saying I would be groping, but I would like to be groped if I looked like that. 
[00:18:00]  There you go.  A little sexual attention.  Yes.  Never hurt anyone, right, Sam?  No, Ed.  Well, Bob, you don't grope a great-grandmother like that.  Wait, let's see all the broads he's groped.  Is that what we got here?  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  The guy or the girl?  Wait, they look like the guy.  Oh, he groped.  Wait.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that lady's face?  Jillian, you want to hang out for this, or are you good? 
[00:18:30]  I'm probably going to hang out and smoke my ball, but I was just going to say you guys  really need to listen to it.  No Quarter.  By Fish.  I think I'm going to do that today.  Thank you.  You're so full of shit, but enjoy looking at all the women that he has groped.  Yes.  All right.  Hey, Iraq, put No Quarter by Fish on in the background.  Yeah, that's good background music while we see who the mayor, Bob Filmer, groped.  Apparently, during this very photo that we're looking at, he put his hands on her buttocks. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  Yes.  But she's got like a plastic face or something.  Yeah, she's got one.  All right, let's go.  Girl number two.  All right.  Well, she just looks like, that looks like a face and body you'd see on a realtor sign.  Holy fuck.  I swear to God, that's where I was going.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The fucking chemistry this week's been amazing.  She, she, I told you!  I love both.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, a realtor woman.  All right, where's number three? 
[00:19:30]  Well, number three we met.  That's Peggy.  We met Peggy.  All right, Peggy's so far the ugliest of the broads.  I mean, I don't think we're going to get much uglier than Peggy.  It's not going to get worse than Peggy.  How could it?  How do you sexually harass her?  She's just a fucking pig.  I know, right?  Yeah.  I'm liking the no court.  Whoa.  All right, now we're talking.  Now we got a bit of a milf on the screen.  All right, that ain't bad.  Blonde.  She looks like Heather Locklear a little bit.  Covering up her aging eyes with sunglasses. 
[00:20:00]  Yes, yes.  But she's got the breast implants looking good.  This is Catherine.  She said that her husband walked away at a public event ten years ago, and Philner made  an inappropriate movement on her body.  Really?  He is a predator.  All right, let's go with number five.  Oh.  Okay, she looks like a politician woman.  Yeah, she does.  Yeah.  She looks like a spokesperson.  She looks like, uh, almost, she almost looks like Lily Tomlin.  Lily Tomlin.  Almost.  Yeah, good one. 
[00:20:30]  This was over the phone and email.  Mm-hmm.  Number six.  Whoa.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  This guy absolutely has issues.  Is that?  I don't know if that's a girl or a woman or a man.  She looks like a cast member on Orange is the New Black.  She looks like, yeah, she looks like the guy that came in with the giant balls.  She looks like Bookman from fucking, uh, Good Times.  Yeah.  Tracy Morgan.  Tracy Morgan.  Yeah.  Wow.  Terrible.  Oh, wow.  James Earl Jones. 
[00:21:00]  This guy didn't set his, uh, sights high.  No.  No.  Very low.  All right, number seven.  Okay, number seven.  Hmm.  Which one?  Well, it's not, what's her name?  I'm sure in the middle.  Oh, that's Gloria Allred on the left.  She's getting involved, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, she's fully.  Oh, she's all over this.  Fully involved.  I believe she's doing a pro bono.  How long is this version of, uh, No Quarter, by the way?  The fuck are we listening to her?  Um, there's a nine and a half. 
[00:21:30]  No, sorry.  There's a ten minute version, and then there's a seven and a half.  Which one are we playing?  Seven and a half.  Oh, boo.  Kitty.  Gotta always go long form.  This is number eight?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, like a, I guess a black woman with blonde hair, short blonde hair.  She looks like NeNe Leakes.  Oh, no.  She's average, too.  That is weird.  Her hair looks like a turban.  Yeah.  A swoop over.  Oh, Kitty on the, that's CNN.  Oh, it's gone now.  Number nine.  Oh, Jesus.  Marilyn Monroe kind of looking, uh, woman. 
[00:22:00]  A pudgy Marilyn Monroe.  Pudgy Marilyn.  Yeah.  A bloated Marilyn Monroe.  Yes, yes.  Drifting towards late in her life, Annie Nicole Smith.  Right.  Uh-uh, that too.  Sure.  All right.  Number ten.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  Wow.  This is the.  You know, one of those broads that thinks it's really cool to have long gray hair.  Long gray hair.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Long gray hair.  All right.  Keep going.  Oh, fuck.  She's like another blonde aging. 
[00:22:30]  She looks like another one that you'd see, like, on a split screen on CNN or Fox News  talking about some issue.  Right, right.  Her neck is the same length as her face.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, but that's a disease.  You shouldn't make fun of that.  Oh.  It's cold.  It's called, um, equidistant neck face.  Oh, my God.  Equidistant neck face?  Okay.  Ah, equidistant neck face.  Yeah, it happens when you're born in the forceps get caught on your ear.  You get equidistant neck face.  It's very common.  Equidistant neck face.  When the fluid drains through your neck quickly and your shoulders. 
[00:23:00]  That's great.  Well, number 12 is the winner.  She's all right.  She's all right.  Another blonde.  Yeah, all right, all right.  Looking pretty good.  She got her posterior patted.  A little pat on the ass?  Yeah.  What's wrong with a little pat on the ass?  Nothing.  And that bothers a woman that much?  A pat?  I probably wouldn't want the mayor to pat me on the ass.  Yeah?  Yeah, but you wouldn't be like...  I'd be like, I'm a young man.  You shouldn't be doing this to me.  Yeah, but you wouldn't go running to the press and just be like, you know, that kind of was weird. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, Jesus.  What the fuck is that?  Hey, this is another one.  He touched me, actually groped me on my backside inappropriately.  He loves grabbing ass.  Wow.  Who doesn't, Sam?  She looks like Joe Biden with a wig.  Yes.  Damn.  Wait, I thought there was only 12.  No, there's 17.  Wait, 17 women.  Right now we're looking at Tom Petty. 
[00:24:00]  With makeup.  This is terrible.  All right, number 14.  Oh my God.  Come on.  That's a lesbian.  It's gotta be.  That looks like fucking Christina Quinn.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, with frizzier hair.  Very spiky hairdo.  Wow.  He would come in and try to kiss me on the lips and I'd have to squirm to get away.  What a weirdo.  This guy is a fucking creep.  And not selective.  No.  No.  He couldn't wait to get out of the house.  His rule was this. 
[00:24:30]  I'll go for anything with a cunt.  From the minute the door closes behind me until I get to work.  Oh, he doesn't care.  Very funny.  Oh, this guy's naughty.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, Mike.  What is that?  She looks like Irma Bombeck.  Yes.  Only 1% of the audience will get that.  But very good.  She does.  It's Scotty from Boogie Nights.  She's a truss.  Very bad.  Wow.  He's terrible.  Her hair is awful.  The average number here is about a 4. 
[00:25:00]  4 to 5.  And that average is going down.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Top's 4 or 5.  All right.  This one says...  You got a couple 7s in there.  Take out the 2.  Yeah, the 2 7s and you're left with a bunch of 2s.  Right.  This one says,  He stopped me and he got very close to me and he ran his finger up my cheek and he whispered to me,  Do you have a man in your life?  Oh, God.  He really thinks like he's got this delusion that he's this lady's man.  He's just a total junkie.  Monsters man. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, he's a junkie.  Oh, wow.  What a do on her.  She's got like a fucking Bay City Rollers hairdo.  She looks like Stern.  Yeah.  Number 17.  Last but not least.  Why wouldn't she?  That's everyone's mom.  Yeah.  That's just some mom.  Yeah.  With the short, sensible hair that's easy to take care of.  You know, after women give up. 
[00:26:00]  They've been married so long, they have no more sexuality left.  They don't care what any guys think of them anymore.  So they chop all their hair off and make it sensible.  So they can leave the house quicker.  Right.  Looks like the mom from the Partridge family, except now.  Oh, yes.  Very good.  Shirley Jones.  Aged Shirley Jones.  What happened to her?  Filner grabbed her hand and fingered her wedding ring and asked if it was real.  She also said he tried to kiss her. 
[00:26:30]  Of course.  But she moved her head and felt his tongue on her cheek.  Wow, he went in tongue out.  Oh, he's great.  Damn.  He's like a fifth grader.  How long has he been to kiss all the girls?  Kissing the girls.  Obviously.  Run away.  Obviously, he's a horrendous person, but there's something funny about some of this stuff.  Because we don't know the people, I guess.  Is that what it is?  That's it.  I think he's a total buffoon about it.  He's ridiculous.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Where are we at with No Quarter, E-Rock?  Oh, I already started the longer version.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, we ran out, so I just went in.  I was listening a little in the background.  It's terrible.  I don't know if it's terrible.  No Quarter is a great song by Zeppelin.  By Zeppelin.  Yeah.  By fucking Fish.  Why?  Fucking Fish.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a hell of a lineup this guy's got.  Oh, man.  What a great...  So what's going on with this guy?  He don't want to leave.  No. 
[00:27:30]  All this fun he's having.  Yeah, he says no.  Can they yank him out of there?  Is he going to find strange women to kiss on the lips?  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll get him out.  The people want him out, and they're taking some referendum to get him out.  How long has he been in office?  I'm not sure.  Eight months.  Eight months.  That was it.  Yeah?  I'm pretty sure it was eight months.  If that long.  He didn't...  He also...  His excuse was no one ever gave him the sexual harassment lesson.  You know? 
[00:28:00]  How in the workplace they give you those...  The film and the little booklet and everything.  He said no one gave that to him,  so he had no idea what was appropriate or inappropriate in the workplace.  Is there a scene in the movie, the sexual harassment,  don't do this movie,  where it says don't lick your co-workers on their cheeks?  Their cheeks.  Yeah, yeah.  Just don't walk around grabbing every ass you see.  Don't put him in the sleeper hold.  And drag him around the office.  Drag him around the office in the sleeper hold.  Fill in their sleeper hold.  Yeah.  And he's saying because they didn't give him that lesson, 
[00:28:30]  that they are responsible for what happened,  so that they should pay his legal bills for all these cases against him.  What a wonderful man.  Yeah, so he wants the taxpayers to put the bill.  Yeah, quite amazing.  He also said that he will be vindicated by a full presentation of the facts.  Oh, full presentation of the facts.  Can't wait to see that.  So let's wait until we judge anything.  Yeah, we should wait.  I'm sure there is.  Before we judge.  Yeah, before we judge the Filner headlock. 
[00:29:00]  We could judge that he has terrible taste.  Oh, look, we were just talking about the Parcher family.  What was David Cassidy arrested for?  Drunk driving.  Drunk driving.  Was it?  Drunk driving?  He pulled a .1.  .1.  South of Albany.  Poor bastard.  He had his high beams on.  Yeah.  And, you know, he didn't turn them down.  Oh, boy.  So that alerted the cops that maybe something was going on.  They pulled him over.  And he was drunk.  And the guy's name was, why do I know all this? 
[00:29:30]  I guess because we do a radio show.  Hey, you're informed.  Never be ashamed of being informed.  It's healthy.  The officer's name was Tom Jones.  What?  So David Cassidy thought it would be fun to go, hey, what's up, pussycat?  Did he say that?  I swear to God he said that.  Oh, you dummy.  He said yes, sir.  No, sir.  So he used to be a teen idol.  He's now 63.  63 years.  David Cassidy's 63.  And called police officers pussycat.  What's up, pussycat?  Pussycat.  Pussycat.  Pussycat.  Pussycat.  Pussycat. 
[00:30:00]  What?  Just the things people do after it.  That reminded me of Choo Choo.  It was What's New Pussycat?  Pussycat.  Pussycat.  I thought it was killing it.  Choo Choo.  Oh, that goddamn.  That's a damn good song, by the way.  What?  Fucking What's Up Pussycat?  What's New Pussycat?  Tom Jones is great.  Oh, Tom Jones is great.  Now that's a powerful voice.  Yes.  Tom Jones is the shit. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  By the way, the San Diego mayor, he's only been mayor for a year.  Oh, it is a year?  But he was in Congress for 20 years before that.  Oh, do you know the shenanigans he must have pulled in Congress?  Kissing, grabbing ass, and headlocking all day long.  All day long.  It's like, you have the Filner internship.  You're a, you're, oh.  And they're just horrified.  No.  No.  Another run. 
[00:31:00]  But I'm not attractive.  No, that's perfect.  I should be safe.  Oh, boy.  Locks him right in.  Headlock.  Headlock.  The old Filner hug.  Come here.  I'll make you feel better.  Yeah.  He goes in tongue first.  He's like a mosquito.  He just goes in with his proboscis out.  Filnerfly.  Filnerfly.  There's never been a mayor with less couth than this man.  He's couthless.  Yes.  You never want to see a tongue. 
[00:31:30]  No.  Tongues could feel good.  But you don't want to actually see it.  It looks ridiculous when you see it.  Absolutely.  Like, I'm not doing this.  No.  No, it has to remain in the mouth until two mouths are together.  It's like an astronaut in an airlock.  You gotta just keep them inside until we've docked.  Right.  And then let's get some fucking wrestling going on.  Yikes.  What is this we're listening to?  No quarter.  Fish.  Turn it up.  No, it's not no quarter.  It's doodoodling. 
[00:32:00]  Could you fucking imagine the anger of standing there?  Dude, I don't want to deal with the jam boards anymore.  No.  Those people are vicious.  Yeah, but I don't care.  For sure.  This could be anything.  This could be fucking no quarter or it could be low spark of high-heeled boys.  Low spark of high-heeled boys.  A little traffic.  That was a pretty good goddamn song back in its day.  Absolutely.  People are reminding me, actually one guy, BC Justin on the Twitter, he writes, and I 
[00:32:30]  forgot about this, Tool covered no quarter.  Tool did.  And it's pretty fucking amazing.  I'm sure it's a lot better than this fucking crap.  I forgot all about it until about ten minutes ago, but Tool definitely covered no quarter.  And did a very, very good job.  More self-serving drivel shit.  What?  Someone's actually saying, come on, Ant?  What?  Ant's right.  What do you mean?  Oh, Tool's version is stellar.  Okay.  It's amazing. 
[00:33:00]  Can you turn this up for a minute?  You gotta hear the vocals.  A lot of music breaks this week.  It's alright.  You sure?  Yeah, we don't usually do many, um, normally.  Alright.  Well, fucking Tool.  What are they up to lately?  I'm a little behind with their music.  Oh.  They still, uh, doing shit out there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Eh.  Eh.  How long is this version?  Uh, ten minutes. 
[00:33:30]  Nice.  Oh, God.  Let's settle in.  Can we get to the meat of this?  No, man.  You gotta settle in.  Oh, I don't want to settle in.  You gotta settle in.  God, I hate fucking jamming.  You need everything in your face immediately.  I need it.  How about a little settling in?  Instant gratification, Anthony.  That's what they call me.  Settle in.  Get your head together, man.  How about riding the wave?  Oh, my God.  Look at Bob Kutchenberg.  Looks like Santa Claus.  With a suitable haircut. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Rob Reiner.  All right.  Sounds like sober.  How about we turn it up a little bit?  Oh, man.  All right.  Does he kick in with the vocals, man? 
[00:34:30]  When did he come in?  Denny would love talking up this stuff.  Oh, my God.  He can't breathe.  All the info.  All the shitting.  Barometric pressure.  You can get everything.  A dew point average.  Traffic.  Oh.  Why?  Are we getting there?  No, we're not.  Relax, man.  This is taking forever.  Relax, man.  Why am I the one that has become the relaxed one? 
[00:35:00]  I don't know.  How the fuck did this happen?  Just chill out a little bit.  Chill?  Should I chill?  Yeah.  It's the waves.  Jimmy is shaking his head disgusted, too.  Come on.  Do you know the original song, though, Jimmy?  No, I don't.  No one's coming home tonight.  What is that called?  No Quarter.  Zeppelin.  Oh, is that called right? 
[00:35:30]  This is just...  It's ponderous.  It's creepy.  I want to hit.  Yeah.  Nice, right?  Nice, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  There's the cool sound.  Yeah.  That just sounds like cool.  All right.  You can figure it out.  It is pretty good.  We'll cut our losses.  In other music news, I knew about this for a while, and it's finally hitting the fucking press.  Richie Sambora has been fired from Bon Jovi.  What happened?  We had Richie Sambora in here recently, and he said he was doing well. 
[00:36:30]  We asked him about drugs and alcohol and shit.  Uh-oh.  It's money.  Is that why they threw him?  Well, they're saying it's money.  There's been rumors for a while that he might have gone back to his old ways.  But now the band has released a statement saying that Sambora has been fired from Bon Jovi over money.  How does that happen?  I think this is complete bullshit.  I really do.  Sources say that Sambora was raking in $2 million a month and 20% of the profits from the tour.  And so he got $2 million a month plus 20% of the profits from the tour. 
[00:37:00]  And his fill-in guy, Phil X, was earning far less, about $10,000 a month on the track.  But how does that happen if you're together for 30 years?  That's why.  It's not about money.  You wouldn't do that.  It has to be personal.  It's either Bon Jovi himself is sick of Richie Sambora's bullshit.  You know, maybe the drugs and alcohol or whatever.  But it's not about money.  You wouldn't do that.  Wow.  With the other guy. 
[00:37:30]  It's pretty much those two guys.  Yeah.  In Bon Jovi.  So you wouldn't do that.  So who are they going to get to go,  Want it!  I think Phil X does.  Oh, yeah?  I think Phil X, if I know a little bit about him, he's replaced Sambora in the past.  And does a very good job.  Oh.  And I believe the fans of Bon Jovi don't mind him at all, actually.  Damn!  You don't want to be expendable like that.  Right.  Yeah, he left the band in the spring, and it's finally coming to light.  They're finally talking about it. 
[00:38:00]  He left citing personal matters.  Okay.  But has since remained mum on the subject, opting to tweet pictures of himself hanging out with his daughter  and talking about his most recent solo album, Aftermath of the Lowdown.  So there you go.  Damn.  Yeah.  Well, if they replaced him, then everybody's fine with it.  They hate each other.  Yeah.  Wow.  And it got to a point they couldn't figure it out anymore.  I told you!  I wonder if the Bon Jovi message boards...  Oh, of course. 
[00:38:30]  I told you they didn't fucking...  I told you they didn't get along.  Wow.  Oh, okay.  A little rock and roll news right there.  You want more rock and roll news?  Sure.  Yeah?  I like a little rock and roll news.  There's some asshole out there that has John Lennon's tooth.  What?  Yeah, he has John Lennon's tooth.  Ah!  And he wants to clone John Lennon.  Oh, well, that sounds reasonable. 
[00:39:00]  Why is this a story?  That sounds reasonable.  Wants to clone him.  Does he have some pulp in the tooth?  He must have the pulp.  He needs some pulp.  Is that where the DNA is, in the pulp?  I think it's easier to get some DNA out of the pulp.  Hey, E-Rock.  Yeah?  Have you had any teeth pulled yet?  No.  Make sure when you get your teeth pulled, you save that shit.  Uh-huh.  Like your jizz.  You don't want anyone cloning your ass.  Imagine that.  Never mind the jizz and the kid.  Yeah, we all know E-Rock fucking takes his jizz with him. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Or at least in the past, before he was married, he didn't want to leave any jizz laying around.  Right?  No way.  Because he was worried the girls were going to impregnate themselves.  So now you've got to fucking make sure you take all your teeth home, too, E-Rock.  It never ends.  I was at the dentist yesterday.  Yeah.  I had a crown put on, and you know how they fit it?  Right.  They've got to fit it, and then pull it back out and fit it, and all that stuff.  Yeah.  And then at one point, she goes to pull it off, and I swear, I almost swallowed it.  You almost swallowed the fucking crown.  It popped off and went right down my throat, but at the nick of time, my tongue went, and 
[00:40:00]  I was able to push it back out.  So I then conveyed that joke to her.  I was like, there's a joke about that.  She said, what?  Yeah.  I was putting a crown in, and the guy swallows it accidentally, and the dentist goes, I can't  do this.  You've got to go to an ear, nose, throat guy, because it's in your throat, and he goes to  the ear, nose, throat guy, and he can't get to it.  He goes, it's gone down to your digestive tract.  You've got to go to a gastroenterologist, and then it goes to the gastroenterologist, 
[00:40:30]  and he goes, no, this is already working itself into your digestive tract.  You've got to go there.  So he goes there, and then that guy goes, uh-uh.  He goes, it's in the end of your colon.  You've got to go to a proctologist.  So he goes to the proctologist, and the crown is just working its way out, and he goes,  oh my god, I can't do this.  You've got to go to a dentist.  He goes, the crown, he saw a tooth in his asshole.  So he looks and said, I can't do this. 
[00:41:00]  You've got to go to a dentist.  It's hilarious.  Did you hear him rushing through the joke?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Were you on laughing gas yesterday?  I wasn't really telling the joke.  Why did I tell this?  I wasn't really telling the joke more than conveying it.  You're way funnier than that.  Why would you do that to your dentist?  Oh, I got it.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a log of shit with a tooth in it.  Yes.  Yes.  Very good.  Well, yeah.  But they laughed.  I told a little slower at the dentist. 
[00:41:30]  I assumed everyone had heard that joke.  So it was a Canadian dentist who bought Lennon's tooth.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, two years ago.  Me too.  He's seeking headlines again, putting out a press release,  and launching a website indicating his intention to extract DNA from the tooth  with the lofty goal of cloning the legendary musician.  Why is this in the paper?  Aren't there other people to clone at this point?  There's other things to put in the paper.  Yes, or other things to put in the paper. 
[00:42:00]  Well, the fact that he has John Lennon's tooth is probably a story.  That's kind of cool.  Take it down to the Pawn Stars' place there.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, it is just a tooth.  We got to frame it.  I'll give it ten bucks.  Ten bucks?  Yeah.  What tooth do you think it is?  Is it a molar?  An incisor?  I wouldn't want a front tooth.  A front tooth would be the one.  Yeah.  Because that's the one everyone saw.  Either a front tooth or a molar. 
[00:42:30]  Anything in between.  Who gives a fuck?  How about a fucking eye tooth?  Eye tooth.  All right.  Now you're talking.  All right.  The John Lennon fangs.  Are we going to clone people eventually?  Or do you think we have?  We better.  Do you think we've already cloned people?  Like we've done the sheep?  We did the sheep.  I think some dirty doctor out there has cloned a human.  You think?  Yeah, but he just can't announce that to the world.  Yeah.  It's very unethical.  I guess the scientific community has made a deal, you know, and said, ah, we won't do 
[00:43:00]  that.  That's bullshit.  It is bullshit.  I think they've already cloned humans.  They probably have somewhere.  All fucked up, though, I bet.  It just didn't work.  Yeah, and just they're observing and, you know, seeing what the fuck, and then maybe  they'll finally announce it to the world.  It would be good to clone yourself, like, right at, let's say right at birth, right, you  clone yourself so that you have pretty much the same age. 
[00:43:30]  Okay.  And then you put the clone in a coma.  Nice.  And then you nourish it and stuff, much like the Matrix.  Fuck yeah.  Or something, and then if something goes wrong with you, you have spare parts.  Right.  That are perfect for you.  And then, you know, your clone, it's been in a coma since it's fucking been an infant,  so it doesn't really have a life or anything.  Can I bring back my long hair?  Your clone is just fucking laying there, all chewed up like a fucking car in the backyard 
[00:44:00]  where you pull parts off of it.  The officer did well when he had the long hair.  Oh, can I bring back the long hair?  The long hair.  You know how unethical that would be?  I'm going to take, yeah, I need three clones from this baby here.  You have a kid, and it's like, yeah, three clones.  Oh, is that a, and stop ripping off a shitty Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.  Which movie was it?  That was it?  What movie was that? 
[00:44:30]  What movie was that?  I'm sure it was a movie.  I know, you know, it was a movie.  Six cents?  No, it's not Sixth Sense, you dummy.  Now they don't want to talk to me.  End of Days.  Sixth Day.  Fuck you, you guys don't even know what the movie is.  Oh, I'm going to start bouncing, you morons.  Why don't we go to break?  I see food is in front of you guys.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Can we play Springsteen's She's the One?  Oh, God. 
[00:45:00]  Why not?  I hate Bruce.  We got a music theme this week.  Yeah.  You don't even like She's the One?  I don't think I even know it.  You know She's the One.  I don't know it by title.  I'm not a Bruce fan.  I mean, I'm a fan.  Seeing him live was pretty cool.  By the way, oh, seeing him live.  Are we going to get to go to the big fucking gig that's coming up?  I would hope so.  I'm sure we will.  I'm sure we will.  I want to see that fucking thing.  Can we talk about what gig? 
[00:45:30]  We're allowed to announce, Dolly.  I saw it somewhere.  Metallica.  Metallica at the Apollo.  What is that about?  Metallica at the Apollo Theater.  Are you serious?  I know.  I want to go.  When is that going down?  In September.  Oh, we're so there.  We better be.  Of course we're there.  But that'd be.  I think so.  I don't think they would.  Now that we're company guys, we're going to be there.  You were talking about the VMAs when you said the big gig coming up.  No.  No, dummy.  No.  I wonder how many fucking Christopher Lane shirts are going to be worn at the VMAs. 
[00:46:00]  You think they're going to wear any shirts?  Yeah, I wonder if they will.  Say justice for Christopher or things like that?  No.  No.  Jamie Foxx will get up there with the...  At least the Daily News has a picture today.  At least the Post.  The Daily News is totally staying away from it.  Yeah.  But at least the Post, it shows a picture.  They leave out the motive.  Why is the Daily News staying away from this story?  Because they're the same reason they're endorsing Christine Quinn.  Right.  They're extraordinarily left-wing.  Yeah.  And I'm not being paranoid. 
[00:46:30]  They're really liberal.  But that's the motive behind it.  Yep.  So, and they're not mentioning the motive.  No.  They're just not mentioning it.  Did you see the guy's tweets?  Of course.  90% of white people, I hate white people.  Yeah.  Did you know we were called Woods?  No.  I did not either.  Oh, yeah.  He goes, since the Zimmerman verdict, I've knocked out five Woods.  That's white people.  For Peckawood.  Comes from Peckawood. 
[00:47:00]  Peckawood.  Aye.  Yeah, yeah.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Yeah.  Aye.  Aye.  I knocked out five Woods since Zimmerman court.  LOL.  Shit, I'ma keep sleepin' shit.  Woods is a derogatory term for white people.  And they're staying away from all of that in the paper.  90% of white people are nasty.  Hashtag hate them.  Could you imagine if Zimmerman had tweeted anything derogatory toward black people at all? 
[00:47:30]  At all?  It would have been like, obviously this is racially motivated.  If his brother tweeted something about black people, it would have been fucking front page in every paper.  Yes, this guy blatantly has been targeting white people, admits to punching and knocking out white people since the Zimmerman trial, shoots a white kid in the back for no apparent reason, and it's not a racial...  And the cops are just as full of shit.  Oh, I know.  I saw that.  They're like, well, we don't see any gang activity, because they don't want their fucking stats to change. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  That's a big part of it, or they're told from above not to do it.  Yeah, you think the brass wants that fucking, that type of behavior in their precincts and areas?  No.  So they go, no, it's not that.  We don't have hate crimes in our neighborhood.  And the paper just, it gives them the excuse not to address it the way they don't want to address it.  Exactly.  But the Drudge Report is the only fucking place I've seen it mentioned.  This is what happened.  Amazing.  And this Michael Dwayne Jones. 
[00:48:30]  This is the life of this promising athlete and student from Australia.  Well, we're going to just take a look at what went into their stupid decision, and we're  also going to hear about who this young man was, their victim, from his girlfriend, who's  speaking out.  CNN, by the way.  Dr. Phil is quite used to helping other people after their personal drama, and now he is at  the center of some controversy himself.  Nothing.  Nothing.  A tweet posted to his account, who's supposed to start a discussion about teen sex and drinking,  has sparked all sorts of outrage online.  The question is, did that tweet cross the line? 
[00:49:00]  Much more on that.  But first up, this hour, we're learning more this morning about the heroic efforts of a  school bookkeeper.  Of course.  Yep.  Stay away from the uncomfortable thing, you fucking white frauds.  Ugh.  Wow.  And Jesse Jackson tweeted, what did he say, that this type of violence is frowned upon?  Frowned upon?  Frowned upon.  I remember.  Frowned upon.  The first time I heard frowned upon was, it was the Homeowners Association, when I was 
[00:49:30]  out in California.  They frowned upon putting CB antennas on the roofs of their buildings.  Frowned upon.  That's as big as the event should be when you use frowned upon.  That's the soft fucking language he uses for these guys.  It was frowned upon.  The justice system must prevail.  Not that this is obviously a racist attack.  All racial attacks have to stop.  It's a hate.  All hate crimes have to stop.  Nothing about it.  He's just as big of a twat as the fucking, as our media is. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, he stinks.  And so does he.  Yeah.  This world is fucking crazy.  They're just dishonest.  The whole world is nuts.  They won't tell the truth about it.  It's very sad.  All right.  Travis.  What you got there?  You know what else is frowned upon?  What's frowned upon?  Having sex with a cleaning lady.  It's frowned upon.  Was that wrong?  Was that wrong?  Sign phone?  Of course.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to do She's the One.  Oh, boy.  Because we can. 
[00:50:30]  And then, like, next break, you're picking a fucking song for once.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  How about that?  Any Abba?  It doesn't matter what the fuck it is.  I don't know.  Just pick anything.  All right.  You can snap your fingers, too.  Yeah.  A hit.  Pearl Jam.  It's going to be quick, because it's a hit.  Stick with the hits.  Yeah.  Nice and quick.  Nice.  Something by the O'Netters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Without the dream, I wish she'd just leave me alone 
[00:51:30]  Because French dreams won't soften  Their boots and French kisses will not forget her song  With her long hair falling  And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun  Oh, she's the one  She's the one 
[00:52:00]  There's a thunder in the heart of a mad  When you're kneeling in the dark  It says you may become an eager  But there's this danger that arises 
[00:52:30]  That tells such desperate lies  And all you want to do is believe her  And tonight you'll try just one more time  To leave it overnight and to break on her  Oh, she didn't take you  But if she didn't break you  She's gonna find out that it's a easy view  And no matter what you see tonight 
[00:53:00]  Oh, she's the one  She's the one  Oh, she's the one  She's the one  Lonsomeness  With her tenderness  A secret love you made 
[00:53:30]  And when love would save you  Whatever you do  Was that beautiful  A secret love you made  A secret love you made  A secret love you made 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:55:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show  On Sirius XM  See, told you we had sponsors  And now, back to  The O.P. and Anthony Show  And it all crashes down 
[00:55:30]  And you break your crown  And you hold your finger  But there's no one around  Nice!  Oh, man.  So psyched.  You are.  I'm psyched.  No.  No.  Yeah!  Nah!  Very exciting.  I'm calling it.  It's Metallica Day.  No.  Yeah, we really should.  With the big announcement.  No, no, no, no, no.  What? 
[00:56:00]  No, no.  No.  There was a big, uh...  No, no, no, no, no.  There was no announcement.  There was no announcement.  Forget, uh...  Sad but true!  Forget that last thing.  There was no announcement.  Big announcement.  No.  I heard from  A very reliable source.  I don't know what source  You could have heard that from.  Roland.  No.  No.  Why would you say his name?  What?  You did.  Roland does not want you  talking about Metallica  playing the Apollo.  Stop saying that.  What? 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  He doesn't want...  I don't know.  What?  What?  Has he been, uh...  in Communicate?  Yeah, he's been texting me.  He's been texting?  Why is he panicking?  Why is he panicking?  Metallica's playing the Apollo.  Hey, when is it?  September?  September.  September, yeah.  21st.  Fuck it.  Someone's got to announce this shit.  Yeah, but...  Is there a big announcement  that was supposed to happen today?  I believe at, uh...  10 a.m.  Where?  At probably one of the rock channels.  I don't know.  Why not us?  Why wouldn't they give us that scoop?  So...  I don't know.  Because most of it...  There's probably more Metallica fans 
[00:57:00]  listening to where they play Metallica.  What's going to be announced at 10 a.m.?  Not really.  And we have more fans listening here  than they do on fucking other stations.  We have a show of fans.  And there's a lot of Metallica fans.  Yeah.  A bevy, I might say.  Holy fuck.  Heavy metal talk.  Well, it's the show going down.  It wasn't running around  telling everybody.  Yeah.  Maybe, uh...  Why are you laughing?  No.  Is he panicking?  Roland is...  Is he panicking?  Roland is in full panic mode.  Why?  He's beyond panicking.  Full panic mode. 
[00:57:30]  Because...  We announced Metallica's playing the Apollo  during our first break.  Yeah.  And now we've turned this into Metallica Day.  What's wrong with that?  Roland says it's still a rumor.  What?  Who cares that at 10 o'clock  they're making the official announcement  when we can make it now?  It's not the rumor.  And I know a little bit about radio.  7.30, a lot of people are listening to their radio.  Absolutely.  So this is the perfect time to do an announcement.  To snatch it.  Yeah.  10 o'clock, everyone's at work.  Exactly.  No one's hearing the big announcement.  Who gives it a turkey?  7.30 is when you make the big announcements. 
[00:58:00]  Metallica, Apollo Theater.  What day?  Sam?  Well, it's September 21st.  September 21st.  Cool.  I can't wait.  Me neither.  I better get tickets.  Yeah, I hope we get tickets to see it.  Front row.  Yes.  We better.  We saw that Bruce thing there.  Saw Paul McCartney there.  That's right.  That was pretty amazing.  And to see Metallica at the Apollo would be fucking cool as shit.  Metallica to rock the Apollo Theater.  I think this was private information.  What?  I think it was private information.  Until Roland told everybody. 
[00:58:30]  Roland's got his ear to the ground, brother.  He knows shit.  And I appreciate that he fucking passes that shit on to us.  How long is the delay before Roland hears this and starts texting and losing his mind?  I don't know.  Let me tell you.  Why is he losing his mind?  He has to be.  This is what we do.  He is in full panic.  We blow up people's spots.  He was texting everybody, requesting certain statements be removed from replays.  Now, why would you remove it from the broadcast if this announcement is supposed to be at 10 a.m.? 
[00:59:00]  Right.  Why take it out of the replay then?  Because it'll already be announced.  Right.  So why?  I don't understand that part of it.  He doesn't want any responsibility.  And I'm sorry.  I also don't understand why he's freaking out.  Yeah.  What has he written yet?  Who's he writing?  I asked him if it was bad if they say it again, since they already did.  Yeah.  And he said, yes.  Super bad.  Why?  Super bad?  And then what did you write?  I'll take the bad movie.  Super bad. 
[00:59:30]  He said, the rumor is the Apollo.  The venue can change.  I said, so it's only a rumor so far?  Not reported?  Right.  And he said, yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And then what?  Well, the rumor is the Apollo Theater.  My mistake, then.  And then what happened?  Who'd you hear the rumor from?  Huh?  Roland.  Yeah.  We shouldn't do it anymore to cover us.  Huh?  What happened?  Oh, we got to cover our asses?  Are we covering asses here?  We now have to cover our asses.  I think he's in route because my last message is not showing up to me.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's in the front car of the train going, can you go faster, please? 
[01:00:00]  I can't push you, push you.  I can't push you.  Could you go faster, please?  I have a text from Roland earlier.  They were saying, they haven't signed.  Tell Jimmy in his ear to stop.  Tell him in his ear.  Like in the middle of the break.  Oh, my God.  Did you imagine that?  No, I did not.  Come on, Jimmy.  Please.  No, shut up.  Jimmy.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  And then, can you cut that out of the replay, please? 
[01:00:30]  Hello?  Cut that out of the replay.  Oh, my God.  He's panicking.  He is freaking out.  He told me, he said, I told Eric to cut that out of the replay.  I said, do you think we should?  He said, yes.  God, yes.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's going to come in here.  We got to lock the door.  Like a fucking monster.  No, I think it'll be the exact opposite.  I think he'll come in defeated and sad.  Do you think he'll cry?  No.  But he'll be like, oh, my God.  He's going to go straight to the boss's office.  No, he wrote something.  He wrote it.  What he wrote was pretty good.  Metallica's show hasn't been announced. 
[01:01:00]  Please, please don't say it again.  Please, please.  I might get murder now.  Telling.  Telling.  That's why yesterday I said it's secret.  He wrote you?  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot this part, too.  Oh.  It was after where he said, tell Jameen is here to stop.  And he goes, he wrote in big letters, secret.  And then it says, Jesus, why?  He only told you yesterday?  Poor guy is going to fucking lose his mind.  We got to lock the door. 
[01:01:30]  We have to.  He's freaking out right now.  He's very scary.  We should not be talking about this.  Apollo Theater, Metallica, September 21st.  Oh, no.  I think that's correct, but I wish you wouldn't bring it up anymore.  You could murder Roland by saying that.  And knowing how the company works, I'm sure there will be about ten seats for actual fans.  Because depending on celebrity involvement, I think there will be ten spots for the fans.  And the rest of the Apollo Theater will be filled with celebrities.  With who's who. 
[01:02:00]  Like Tom Hanks.  Oh, my God.  Do you think they'll hold back a pair of tickets to Lotto to the employees?  Oh, maybe bring a stripper or a tranny?  Well.  And I.  Huh.  This is exciting news.  It really is.  I can't wait.  It's not news.  No?  Ten o'clock, it'll be official?  It's a secret.  Until ten.  Is it a secret or a rumor until ten?  Some people can't keep secrets, can they? 
[01:02:30]  Who are you talking about?  I don't think it's a secret anymore.  So, I guess.  Lose lips sink ships?  It's a rumor, I guess, officially, right?  Well, you have announced it as fact that you guys are a trusted source of information.  Oh, no.  This is happening.  Lose lips sink ships.  This is happening, and it'll be official at ten o'clock.  According to Roland, it's still a rumor.  How could it be a rumor, like, this close to ten?  Yeah, no one's signed.  But they're not up at this hour still signing contracts.  The ink is dry.  Oh, please.  This is going down.  No, no. 
[01:03:00]  Don't say anything.  Why?  No, don't say anything.  Fuck, man.  It's all good, right?  Poor Roland.  Oh, man.  He's got to be en route.  He's got to be.  Could you go a little faster, please?  Please.  You gotta go faster.  Could we not stop at 59th Street?  According to some text messages, this could indeed be the last Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, no.  Because you guys chose to make that announcement.  Wow.  Is that from...  Who's that from?  I mean, based on the information we've gotten, there could be murders. 
[01:03:30]  Murder.  Because of...  I love that one.  Why?  Because of this announcement that you guys chose to make.  And I love the other one.  Was it Jesus Why?  Yeah, Jesus Why.  Jesus Why.  Can you imagine living that tortured life?  That's what you say when you're given a terminal diagnosis.  That's what the girl said after her fucking foot got cut off by that road cam.  That's what you say when you realize you've lost a foot.  Not when you announce a Metallica show at the Apollo Theater. 
[01:04:00]  How cool is that?  I can't wait to fucking see that, man.  That is cool.  That's going to be great.  I hope we get tickets.  We're definitely going.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  After all the trouble...  It'd be great.  After all the trouble, you guys are going to get in for announcing this?  I don't see you guys getting tickets.  What?  No?  No, I don't see it happening.  Come on.  I hope you guys don't get suspended for like a week and two days.  Oh.  Oh.  I wonder if...  Look out.  I hope some of us don't get suspended for one day longer. 
[01:04:30]  Uh-oh.  Well, you know what?  We're hearing from the bosses and we might just get suspended.  Nah, we'll be here tomorrow.  Don't worry.  Yeah, don't worry.  Everything's good.  Yeah.  Of course.  I got a great fucking idea.  Oh, yeah?  Could you mute the mics?  All right.  They're muted.  Yeah?  Let's act like we stole some fucking tickets.  I'll pretend I broke into the boss's office. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  It made sense at the time.  No, but I'll come in.  I'll go like, what the fuck?  I broke into the boss's office.  And you guys go, chip off.  Although I like that Roland is now playing up that in the reality thing.  The bosses don't want us announcing this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just heard back from them.  Okay.  Okay.  What did he say?  What did he say?  I said, they're talking about it again.  He said, why?  I'm in the subway.  Oh, no.  Tell him what you've been hearing.  Well, the why is because they're very excited.  They're very excited. 
[01:05:30]  They're big Metallica fans.  And they couldn't help themselves.  Let him know.  Very excited.  They were asked, how did they get this information?  And they announced on the air that Roland did indeed.  They said you told them.  Oh, Jesus.  Roland Cantlos presents.  Oh, poor Roland.  No, don't tell him that while he's in the subway.  Wait till he's away from the train.  Oh, he's going to jump on the tracks.  He's writing back.  I already sent it.  He's writing back?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I said they're very excited. 
[01:06:00]  They said you told them.  Oh, no.  I texted, Opie needs 12 tickets.  He's texting.  He said, I told Jimmy it's a secret.  Great.  Secret.  He's having a terrible movie.  Anthony is the one who said it.  Exactly.  I didn't even.  It's not for air.  It's not for air.  I'm telling him I think it's okay.  He's having a lousy morning.  No, no, no.  Just write back.  Oops.  Oops.  Right back.  Yeah.  What are you going to do? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Whatever.  The guys say it's one of those things.  Yeah.  Shit happens.  Shit happens.  Yeah.  You know the guys.  Boys will be boys.  I think he's.  Ladies and gentlemen, there's been an emergency on the subway line.  We're going to need you to get off and we will supply bus transportation.  A gentleman has thrown himself in front of the subway car.  He's fine, but the train is broken.  Is he riding back? 
[01:07:00]  No, he's back underground.  Oh.  Feel fast, Tiffany.  Please skip the station.  He probably stopped at a station that has, you know, cell service.  Oh, so he can listen.  Oh, he's typing right now and he sees like no service is panicking.  The delay is crazy long.  Right.  So he might actually hear the entire break.  There's going to be like when at AAF when the news guy popped out and caught you guys  in the elevator.  Yes. 
[01:07:30]  The news guy is going to pop out and say, how do you feel?  Your talent booker threw himself in front of a train because you announced a concert.  We feel about, look, we apologize to Roland and his family.  And then Opie will go, I didn't even know the conductor was a fan.  With that stupid laugh afterwards.  Oh, God.  What?  Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  What?  I don't know.  What?  What?  Uh, yeah.  I mean, Roland's, he's got to relax.  Man, man.  It's all good.  You sold him out. 
[01:08:00]  Yep.  The Apollo.  That's a, man.  That's a secret.  A secret is the word that.  Because to see fucking Paul McCartney there.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Springsteen.  Even Bruce.  Like, and I'm not a Bruce fan, but to see him there, the energy that.  Somehow it just energizes the performers.  Now, to see Metallica at the Apollo Theater.  Oh, I can't wait.  On September 21st will be amazing.  Why do you keep bringing it out?  What?  It's a secret.  What are they going to open with, I wonder?  I don't think it's a secret. 
[01:08:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  They're not close with that.  Ride lightning.  But at this point, it can't be a secret, so we might as well keep talking about it.  Yeah, we said it.  Yeah, we said it.  Fuck it.  Right?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do, man?  I'll just be, uh.  Jim's nonchalant shrug.  After we said it, we said it.  I mean, what are you?  Yeah, it is what it is, right?  I'm going to tell Roland, sorry, I guess it's sad but true.  Nice.  That they'll be playing there, Roland.  Yeah.  We announced it.  Looks like the Sandman entered. 
[01:09:00]  Hmm?  Yeah.  Jim, they might need an opener.  Fuck yeah.  Maybe I will.  Sick fucking puppies, man.  That'd be cool.  Everything sounds like...  Horrible guitar sound.  You don't think they would get cheered in front of Metallica?  Oh my God.  You'd think people would want Metallica on as soon as possible? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  And by the way, I know you guys may not have enjoyed We're Cutting the Cheese.  Oh God.  But somebody's manager can't stop singing it.  Oh no.  Oh really?  Somebody's manager has been standing in front of the TV and singing it while his wife is trying to watch TV.  Jonathan is nuts.  He is nuts.  And apparently even created his own opera version.  That's what I've heard.  Yeah.  Do we have it?  No.  That's crazy.  Yeah, but it's not good. 
[01:10:00]  Text message.  Oh no.  Roland.  Oh.  What's he saying?  How's Roland doing?  Where is he?  What is he saying?  Almost here?  I said, I think it's okay.  But hey, what are you going to do?  You know them.  And he said, yeah, I thought Jimmy would.  He loves them.  I don't know what that means.  He really thinks I blew it.  So he's accepting it.  They're all very excited.  Roland thinks that I blew it.  Because he trusted me and I never would have blabbed it. 
[01:10:30]  You didn't blab it.  Should we pump it up and say that Scott Greenstein's waiting outside the studio to talk to us?  We just said, no, Scott's been in communication.  Like, Scott's pissed.  Pump it up.  Just let him know management doesn't seem happy.  Should we pump it up?  Yeah, management's not happy.  Should we ask him, did you clear this with Scott?  Because he's been...  He said, kill me.  He's so bummed.  Say Scott wants to talk to us during the next parade.  He does not handle work-related pressure well at all.  At all.  Fucking Major Hassan handled it better in Fort Hood. 
[01:11:00]  Fucking Roland handles it.  Oh my God.  Poor guy.  See what he says to that.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  My turn to go.  Oh, yeah.  It was delivered, so we'll see.  All right, we'll see what he says.  Hate.  I'm your hate.  God, I can't wait to see it.  Pay.  Pay the price.  Pay for nothing.  You think they're going to play the hits?  They better play the fucking hits. 
[01:11:30]  Well, they're promoting their movie, so it's like they don't even have a lot of new songs,  I mean, because they're promoting their film.  It's just insensitive of you guys to get further on.  Like, even for the people just tuning in now, you're still making the announcement based  on exclusive information given solely to you guys by Roland.  Roland, as we discussed.  Roland.  Well, what are you going to do?  Roland gave you the facts, huh?  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  Because then you could come in and make the announcement. 
[01:12:00]  You could come in and say it and be all excited about it.  People are excited.  What's this fucking 7.30, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, noon?  And now you have a one-up on everyone requesting tickets.  Exactly.  You knew we were going to win.  We say right away, we need tickets to this amazing event.  Metallica, the Apollo.  Yeah, I can't wait for the Apollo Theater show.  It'd be great.  Those shows are so good.  I got a lot.  Da-da-da-da.  We're the four horsemen.  I hope we get the guys in. 
[01:12:30]  I mean, they're...  Now we won't.  No, now we can't.  Is he running back?  No.  Oh.  I don't know where he is.  His phone is going right to voicemail now.  It's just laying on the third rail.  Yeah.  Fizzling.  Dot.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Shh.  I know, I'm not saying anything, but...  What?  That's great. 
[01:13:00]  Come on.  Ah, well.  We'll give away the punchline in a minute here.  Ah, ah, ah, Roland.  Oh, boy.  This is not going to be good for Roland.  No.  It's not confirmed, though.  Nope.  No.  That's why I'm saying it's not going to be good.  Yeah.  Hi-oh.  What the hell's going on with that hovercraft that just...  Oh, it's Russia.  Okay.  Russia really doesn't care about their people.  No, no.  There's people on the beach somewhere, and a giant military hovercraft just comes screaming  onto the beach. 
[01:13:30]  Wow, that thing's fucking big.  Is that a fake video, or is that real?  No, it's real.  Oh, okay.  Big hovercraft.  Well, it's obviously...  You're seeing the foreground, but they probably have it roped off.  Wow, man.  That's fucking cool.  I didn't see that at the beach.  No.  That'd be crazy.  Oh, wow.  Did he just text again?  Well, I told him that Scott wants to talk to you guys, and he said, great, I am fired.  Do you want him to come in when he gets there?  Why is this funny to us? 
[01:14:00]  Hold on, let me write.  I mean, it...  Oh.  What are you going to write?  There's a good chance that that could happen.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm going to write him back to make him feel better.  Murder.  Oh, I'm sure.  To make him feel better.  What did you say?  Dude, chill.  Chill.  He'll probably appreciate it.  Yeah.  Hello.  Yeah, it's like, don't worry.  Tell me to chill.  Right.  Everything's fine.  I'll just chillax that in the meantime.  Have you checked your Twitter?  No.  Everyone is...  Can we give away the punchline now, or...  No.  No. 
[01:14:30]  No.  No, no.  Wait for Roly.  Wait for Ro-Ro?  Do you want him to come in when he gets there?  He's on 42nd right now.  Of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right here.  Yeah.  Jimmy told me to chill out.  Everybody except for Roland is probably aware of the punchline, but...  Yeah.  Can you come in right...  When you...  And also, right, right, things are getting pretty heated.  Things are getting heated.  Yeah.  Tell him to come straight to the studio.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:15:00]  I did.  Oh.  Oh, this poor boy.  Poor little Roland.  Oh, my God.  Poor Roland.  You told me to chill out.  Tell Roland we made ABC News.  You want me to...  Yes, tell him...  Tell him that...  I swear to God, they just posted this 14 minutes ago.  ABC News is picking up on us, talking about it, and they just put it on their website.  Oh, no.  Oh, Roland. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  I mean, that's not a lie.  ABC News has picked it up.  Oh.  It says the headline...  Tell him the headline says, Metallica set the headline, legendary venue.  Oh.  And then write, oh, no, after it.  Posted 14 minutes ago.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Posted 14 minutes ago.  I wrote, ugh.  Yeah.  Did you write that?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Can you come in right when you get here?  Things are getting heated.  ABC News has picked it up.  Ugh.  Right.  Oh, he thinks he's so fired.  Poor boy.  You writing to him? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  What?  What are you telling him now, Jimmy?  Seriously.  Chill.  No, I wrote something.  Dude, it's exciting!  Exclamation point.  This is so fucking mean.  He's our friend.  Oh, he's like a little puppy.  It's a terrible work environment.  He's a panda.  Sal, are we getting the panda angry?  Don't get the panda angry! 
[01:16:30]  And then there's the panda.  Listen to the panda.  Listen to the...  Wait, wait.  There we go.  I love right to the end.  Yeah.  It's a lion.  It's a lion, right?  He's not telling the truth.  Oh, oof.  Sorry, guys.  It's a little levity.  Good one, sale.  I miss the girls.  You do?  Yeah.  What were their names?  What?  Jackie and fucking...  What's her name?  No. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  It's...  Of course, Sydney.  The...  I just miss, you know, coming in the door and getting a...  Good morning!  Yeah.  I know.  From the...  I waved to you today.  The playroom.  Yeah, exactly.  From the playroom.  Exactly.  The playroom.  From summer camp office.  Oh, Roland's here.  Yes, Roland.  Oh, boy.  Where's Roland?  Oh, no.  He's welcome.  That's cool, though.  Roland.  Roland.  Yes.  How was your commute?  Oh, fantastic. 
[01:17:30]  TMZ just picked it up.  What?  Yeah.  We're on TMZ.  That's fucking awesome.  Well, awesome.  Congratulations.  What happened?  It's exciting.  I'm going to text Troy, see if he wants a beach mate today.  Why?  I mean...  You think you're in trouble?  Come on.  Well, you think there's some level of professionalism when we say don't see anything.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Roland.  And I love you at all.  It's just...  But we're getting our names out there.  Just hit Google.  Google News. 
[01:18:00]  Just hit Google?  Yeah.  Should I look it up?  Oh, fantastic.  Show them the ABC headline.  That's the best one.  Oh, wow.  Who told you that this has to be kept quiet?  Metallica set the headline like...  Oh, shit.  ABC News.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah, guys.  Oh.  Who told?  And this is just like a fun thing that they're adding.  And while Apollo is known for its Sandman character, Enter Sandman is one of Metallica's  famous songs.  Oh.  I did not know that. 
[01:18:30]  That's a little fun.  What...  Roland.  Yes, sir.  Who said that this really has to be kept quiet?  Well, you just...  You always get those sense of secrets.  Like when you guys talk here and you guys look at us, we're like, okay, that information  should keep quiet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This one was tough to keep quiet, though.  So I didn't know that...  And then that's why it said that when Jin was concerned about, like, what about this?  I go, don't worry.  We're taking care of this, this, and this for you.  Everything will be taken care of.  So we're going to get tickets?  You think we'll get tickets?  Yay.  I don't know. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know.  And I emailed the guy.  He's calling them today to talk to them.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So it's confirmed?  This one was a little too exciting.  Metallica?  I don't know.  Apollo Theater?  Confirmed?  Is it confirmed?  I guess you guys take care of the PR department work.  We go home.  Mission accomplished.  That's what we do if we do Marge's job.  Everyone's thanking us on Twitter.  That big stump is probably Hillary.  Now, do you think, why do you think you're in trouble here? 
[01:19:30]  I don't know.  You know how this place works.  It's like, you on the air, you talk, and they go, oh, it's fine.  And then you hear other things like, oh, well, you're not on the air.  And if we could speak, before you got here, I mean, you did, you said on the air that you  got the information from Roland.  I got my information from Sam.  Oh.  I just heard about it just now.  Well, everybody pretty much heard from Roland.  See, that's why he thinks. 
[01:20:00]  I thought it was exciting.  It's very exciting.  I don't know.  It's another one of these legendary performers at a legendary venue.  I guess if you're a fan, it'll be woo-hoo.  Roland.  Now the show's making some headlines.  Roland.  Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  Yeah, we're cool.  It's okay.  We'll be all right.  All right.  We'll get you through this one.  Yay.  Well, at least they're all on vacation today.  Who, Metallica?  No.  The Apollo. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, management.  Management's on vacation?  Mani Gio Mente.  All of them?  I think the ones who yell are.  The ones who yell.  Oh, man.  There's already a fucking...  You guys were right.  It is exciting.  Thanks, Rolando.  99. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, that's so mean.  You're being credited.  That's kind of cool, Roland.  Somebody made a photo of Metallica, and on top it says, Metallica at the Apollo 921, and  on the bottom it says, thanks at Rolando's 99.  Yeah.  Which is Roland's Twitter handle.  Yeah.  Last time this happened, the guy's running for president now.  Christy.  Oh, when I see this.  Oh, right, right, right.  I remember that.  It'd be flashbacks.  And that had to do with the Apollo Theater.  Right.  Yeah.  No, that was The Garden.  Okay, The Garden.  Right, right. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, I forgot about that.  But still, though, I didn't know he was going to come running for president.  My bad.  Are you going to go?  Where?  Metallica.  No, thank you.  Apollo Theater.  No, I'd rather have a fan go.  September 21st.  I'd rather have a fan go than...  What?  You don't want to see Metallica?  No.  Why?  I have no interest.  Then why would you announce this?  I'm not announcing it.  It just was...  Why would you announce this to everybody?  You don't even care about the band.  Did you worry about some bookings?  I said, don't worry, we're working on it.  Oh, cool.  See?  Because Roland told Jimmy... 
[01:22:00]  I didn't say nothing.  And then Jimmy told...  Jimmy told...  In confidence, though, I think.  ...me.  No, he didn't say anything about the...  Yeah, we didn't know.  ...secret.  Oh.  Oh, me.  I just heard...  You gotta blame Jimmy.  I was like, get the fuck out of here.  And he goes, no, Roland, you know, it's probably good information.  And it was, apparently.  I guess.  Are they...  And we're desperate for attention over here, so we've said, fuck it, let's do this.  Is it all signed?  I don't know.  The venue's secured?  Let's ask the... 
[01:22:30]  Because I hear tell, maybe the venue's not secured yet.  Oh, boy.  Let's ask...  Let's ask our on-air reporter, Mr. Rick Hughes.  Hey!  Why are you panicking?  You are freaking out, Roland.  This is the hell that is my life.  Oh, my God.  Everybody's good.  Everybody's psyched about it.  Yeah.  Oh, yay.  It's only good news, right?  It's all good, right?  It is.  Until the wizard comes. 
[01:23:00]  I can't imagine this would actually be a problem.  No worries.  Right?  Hopefully, the wizard gets stuck in the subway.  Please, Jesus.  Do your magic.  We saw your tsunamis.  What the fuck?  We saw your tsunamis.  They stay stuck in the subway.  It does seem like sensitive information.  Was it, though?  How sensitive was this?  Scale of one to ten.  Ten being, like, fucking...  I heard other people yapping a lot in the hallways, so... 
[01:23:30]  Fuck them and bring them all down.  Wow.  Hallways are a little different than on-air, though.  Especially on this giant show.  Quarantine chart, too.  That's what they said.  Yeah.  Y'all.  Y'all.  That's great.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We should go to break, I guess.  Yay.  Oof.  It's going to be awkward.  Yeah.  When we're off the air.  Are you going to yell at us when we're off the air?  Or are we going to just crawl to the table and take a shit and just walk right now? 
[01:24:00]  I don't want to go to break.  I know.  It's all fun when we're talking into the mic and then you go to break and we've got to  look at Roland.  Like a real person?  Yeah.  Did we let you down?  What?  Did we?  We didn't let you down, did we?  Let's rewind the history of this show.  It's one of the bumps, as we say.  It's one of the bumps, as we say.  I feel bad now.  Yeah.  That happens.  What are you going to do, right? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, you know.  We should be good.  A few more dicks in the ass.  You think this is a dick in the ass situation?  No.  This is probably like a Puerto Rican dick in the ass.  It's a little bit bigger than others.  Oh, wow.  Gee.  Thanks for listening to me that.  Like, yeah, yeah.  You leaving some nasty comments on his Instagram later?  I'm going to find his children picture and post them.  Ah, that is a good one.  I'm going to find out where he works and then shit on him and his company.  That's one of my favorite things to do, by the way, is find the pictures of their kids. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  When somebody really fucks with you on Twitter, you just fucking dig, dig, dig into their Instagram,  into their fucking...  You look way early on in their Twitter account.  You have to keep going back, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to keep going.  But you go, like, years back, because when they originally got Twitter, that's when people  post the most pictures, you know, because they're all excited and shit.  And that's where you find their pictures.  And then you go, wow, what a fucking cross-eyed-looking dork kid you have. 
[01:25:30]  And then they cancel their account.  Well, they call me fat.  I find Instagram.  His wife is fat.  I go, can your wife join me for the biggest loser?  That fat whore.  What?  Wow, we were keeping it fun.  Whoa, whoa.  Taking it a little too far.  Look at his eyes.  They're a little crazy.  Oh, the wife is good, too.  You go after the wife, girlfriend, fucking anything.  Yes.  Go for the throat.  They hear your feelings.  Right?  Yes.  We were just doing good, exciting news today.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  The news is Metallica, the Apollo Theater, thanks to Roland, September 21st. 
[01:26:00]  Confirmed as per Rolando's 99.  So you can thank him on Twitter.  Hey, fans.  Enjoy.  Oh, God.  He's freaking out, man.  Why are you freaking out?  I don't know.  Enough with the secrecy around here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  If we got info, we're going to fucking say it to the transparency.  Yeah.  Why wait till 10 o'clock?  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  What's so special about 10 o'clock? 
[01:26:30]  Who cares you got this info illegally?  Right?  We're fucking going to talk about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're part of the story.  We're going to get some hits, boys.  Yeah.  Oh, sweet Jesus.  Riding.  Riding.  Oh, no.  Now Edgar's fucking molesting him.  Do your duty and stop talking about Malika.  Oh, Malika.  What the fuck?  All right.  Good.  Oh, Rolly.  So now they don't have to make the announcement at 10 o'clock. 
[01:27:00]  You save them time, paperwork, and all that stuff.  What else are they going to talk about?  Like the fucking, what?  There's a channel?  No, the special opener.  Oh.  I'm just kidding.  I don't know.  There's a Metallica channel?  I don't know.  That's going to be kicking up?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know in serious.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  No, that's pretty cool, though.  Yeah, it is very cool.  I would think.  I'll listen to that.  I'll fucking listen to that in a second.  Or listen to the Bruce channel.  Well.  She's the one I played today for you.  The Metallica channel thing was probably part of the big announcement that was supposed 
[01:27:30]  to be made later.  I am.  I don't think that's been reported.  That probably came from Sam.  Oh, boy.  You're an ass, Sam.  I think, as I said, this is all news to me.  Yes, Sam.  Oh, gosh.  You wait, Timmy.  You all right, Roland?  No, I should be all right.  This is serious accident.  At least we got to get health insurance.  Oh.  So I could go tell the doctor, remove the dick.  You think this is a dick in the ass situation?  I think so.  I think he thinks that.  I don't think it is. 
[01:28:00]  How big, though?  Chill.  Is that a Puerto Rican dick in the ass?  Yeah.  Like a poe.  Did you get Jim's text to just chill?  Yeah, but you always say to just chill all the time when I go freak out.  Yeah.  Why aren't you chilling?  If Jim says, just chill, that should be good enough.  It's all good.  Vacation's coming.  I get that from all these guys, and when things hit the fan, they're like, ah, don't  worry.  And should we cut this from the replay?  Well, I would.  It's too late. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, but now it's not just an announcement.  Yeah, now it's a giant segment.  The replay's going to be short.  It's already on fucking YouTube, probably.  Oh, yeah.  I was thinking about taking a sick day today and just fucking just get wasted.  Fucking zoot it.  Yeah.  A little zootage.  Yeah, zootage.  I was thinking nice morning shit and everything.  It's ruined.  Yeah, it was the shootage.  It was good.  The entire thing, he texted me and it was ruined.  Oh.  It's ruined.  This ruined your morning shit?  Yes.  That I'm sorry about. 
[01:29:00]  That is bad.  Well, how many people knew about this?  Probably now.  Check your Twitter.  No, I know.  I mean, the Twitter has exploded.  People are very excited about Metallica at the Apollo Theater, September 21st, thanks  to Roland.  And the new Metallica channel.  Right.  That's going to be launching here on SiriusXM.  What?  Mandatory Metallica.  Mandatory Metallica.  Are we doing Mandatory Metallica?  That's the name of the channel.  Nice.  Yay.  That's the name of the channel.  Mandatory Metallica.  Wow.  Where'd you hear that?  That's sweet.  Roland.  Why would you? 
[01:29:30]  You guys got my email?  Awesome.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, this is scary, Roland.  I hate this version of Roland.  I know.  It's not fun.  It's scary, Roland.  And no one wants to go to break.  Nothing.  Gosh.  It'll be all right.  It'll be fine.  Don't sweat it.  We'll try to talk to the bosses today.  I checked out.  I got to leave right away.  Well, I mean, you got to leave right away.  Talk to the bosses.  If they want to meet us in the elevator, that's cool. 
[01:30:00]  Or maybe if you...  I don't want to overstep my boundaries.  Maybe if you guys could Skype in for me.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  I can't take this.  Oh.  I feel bad, Roland.  Yeah.  It's got to suck to be in the know like you are.  You know, and then we have to do what we do.  But he's never going to tell us anything again.  But we have to.  Why do you have to?  I was so psyched to hear this yesterday.  I know.  Absolutely. 
[01:30:30]  Run onto the radio and talk about it, right?  I had good dreams of me running around.  Chocolate fountains.  And then you woke up to this.  There's shit everywhere.  That's ironic.  I'm just not looking at anyone.  That's not good.  Chocolate fountains.  Now there's shit everywhere.  Never free.  Never me.  Yeah.  Say about true.  Don't be unforgiven.  I hope we don't remain unforgiven.  Yes.  Yeah.  It is exciting. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Huge band, small venue.  Maybe I might as well do it now before I get asked.  Slabo!  I know for my last slabo.  It's not your last slabo.  I don't know if I get yelled at.  Why would you get yelled at?  Yeah.  They like meetings here.  You told us something.  You can't see for three seconds and you go, oh.  Look, you told us something.  We couldn't help ourselves.  We're the ones that spilled the beans.  When we'd be in trouble.  You know.  You don't have a radio show.  They're free to view.  No.  That's true. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah.  I love that.  Once they hear the dean in the elevator closed, they're like, oh, we need to see you for a  minute.  I'm like, oh.  Oh, and then they'll take it out on you?  Of course.  Oh, man.  Well, we won't allow that.  Management 101, chapter four.  Yeah.  Dick's in the ass.  We will not allow that and we'll stay behind you 100%.  Do you have my Escalade number for when I'm driving home?  I do.  If you need it.  I'll slice your tires.  Oh, shit.  Here it comes.  The scary Roland. 
[01:32:00]  Here it comes.  Run away, man.  Oh.  It's in my blood.  Oh.  Yeah, you can't go to break.  Why?  No, this is scary.  No, because there will be venom at the break.  Come on.  Now we're all having a good time.  He just starts choking people out.  No, I'll just bite Sam.  Oh.  Why do you bite me?  You always take your anger out on me.  Yeah.  Should, uh, maybe Roland should leave the studio before we go to break.  Because I'm a little scared of you.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Don't forget people.  Apollo.  Oh, God.  Oh.  You should have more excitement.  Oh, no.  Not this music.  What is it?  It's the Hulk slowly walking away music.  Sad Hulk.  You want to give out your, uh, last slobo?  Sure.  Slobo!  Oh.  That was a sad one.  It was a sad one.  That is a sad slobo. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  You're, uh...  He doesn't want to leave the air either because he knows that...  That's probably it.  You know?  I'm used to his uncomfortableness.  What's up?  This is uncomfortable.  I know.  The reality is right outside the door.  Why?  Yeah.  It's fantasy in here.  You get all the credit now instead of some nobody on this platform.  Yeah.  Oh.  Looks like you put it that way for a lot better.  We're in all the headlines.  It's nice.  It's nice to have our names out there a little bit. 
[01:33:30]  I just don't think this is the way the company that put together the event foresaw this.  Company schmumpany.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, at 10 o'clock when they make the big announcement, make-believe, you don't know.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah, just fake it.  When someone says that, just go, oh!  Oh, I heard that at 10.  I didn't know about this.  Do tell!  Whoa.  Ta-da.  I'd better tune in the metal station.  Yeah.  Yeah, so they go, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo.  Guess what?  The guy that right now is dead. 
[01:34:00]  Check their Twitter.  Yay.  All right.  We're going to go to break.  Yay.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to go order bacon.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go order bacon.  I will.  We'll try to figure out a way out of this.  Oh, he's walking away with the slow walking away music.  Oh, no.  He's kicking dirt behind him.  He just kicked dirt behind him.  Like a cat bearing a doody.  There he goes.  I love the clip.  He's so, he's so mad.  Hang on. 
[01:34:30]  He's about to go into the production studio so he'll be able to hear.  Yeah.  He's going into CD Rock?  Yeah.  He's in there.  E-Rock, turn on the mics.  Could you, could you?  Um.  What was you?  I rolled.  You all right?  So, um, I don't know.  Let me check the internet.  I can't hear you.  At least press release.  I think he did because they set it on the air.  Oh, no. 
[01:35:00]  It's like a serious release.  Okay.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you breathing?  Mm-hmm.  That's what murderers do.  Breathe.  Breathe.  You okay?  It's really press releases.  And is there one?  Mm-hmm.  Those fuckers.  Fucking with me. 
[01:35:30]  They go eat a piece of shit.  What's a piece of shit?  There's three press releases here.  God damn it.  You fucking asshole.  They got me.  Fucking asshole.  They got me.  Come on in here, Roland.  Three press releases here. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, Roland.  Yeah.  Yeah, Metallica!  Yeah!  Apollo!  It's been on Metallica's own website for seven hours, by the way.  Yeah, ABC had it for seven hours.  ABC's had it.  We definitely don't like them anymore.  It's been Outlook.  Billboard.  It's on Billboard Magazine's website.  I don't look at the internet when I wake up in the morning.  And I heard about this on Twitter last night. 
[01:36:30]  So that's what I brought up this morning, because Jimmy never told me.  He was quiet.  I didn't hear it from you.  I heard it on Twitter.  I'm like, oh, by the way, anyone hear about this Metallica thing at the Apollo?  I heard about it on Twitter last night.  Well, all these three assholes were texting me.  Dude, Scott wants to talk to you.  You know who got the information before we announced it?  Who?  Kentucky.com.  Look at that.  Kentucky.com.  Kentucky.com.  Actually, Kentucky.com is big with music announcements. 
[01:37:00]  They got the Sabbath record before anybody else had it.  Wow.  Because when Sam flipped there, I saw a bunch of them.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Did he release your print series?  I'm the one who gave it.  Yeah, it's been out this past, right?  Yes.  I bet you thought we were like a four horseman.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  We're the four horsemen.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[01:37:30]  Sirius XM.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Till the window burns.  Time to slowly turn.  Someone there is dying.  People's of the flames.  Do you feel your name?  Can't you hear your babies crying?  I don't remember.  Metallica playing September 21st at the Apollo Theater for Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:38:00]  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Being a company guy, I figured we really should announce it on our channel.  Yes.  We got a lot of...  Throwing himself out the window.  Yeah.  We got a lot of people listening to this damn channel, I think.  We don't know, for real.  We've never seen numbers.  We have no fucking idea.  It's weird.  Well, now the purists come out.  Does your rock know any old Metallica songs?  Yay!  Fishman's mad at you.  Fishman's mad at you.  Oh, Fishman.  P-H or F-I? 
[01:38:30]  P-H-F.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I got to go, guys.  You're going now?  In a few minutes, yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  I know.  It's a heartbreaker to lose me.  Oh, man.  I'll wait a couple minutes.  I have to walk over to do this radio and satellite TV tour.  Whoa.  For the big comedy special that's happening tomorrow night, 10 o'clock.  Yeah, tomorrow night.  On Epix.  EpixHD.com.  Thank you, buddy.  I hate...  American Degenerate.  I hate these TV tours and stuff because you sit there.  I haven't done a TV one, but I hate doing morning TV because I'm not good on it. 
[01:39:00]  So how does this work?  What do you do?  For the radio tours, it's 10 minutes on every station.  Uh-huh.  And you basically pass through.  And this is all the guys I've talked to before who I like, and they have good audiences in  their markets.  You know, Jim.  Hey, guys.  I talked for a little bit.  They fake a few laughs because I'm clumsily fucking meandering to my horse shit because  they're being polite and they want it to sound good.  And then we go, all right, well, again, they promote the special and they...  And then you move on to the next one.  Move on to the next one, yeah.  So we want to patch in. 
[01:39:30]  How do we do this?  I don't know.  Come on.  We need to patch in.  I have zero idea how to do it because of its premiere radio networks.  I just don't know.  And what about the TV thing?  How do you do that?  That I haven't done, but I've done enough of the morning shows.  We probably just sit there and they talk to you on an ISDN line or, you know, there's  a camera.  Oh, right.  So you're there in the little box in the corner.  Yeah.  I think the same way that you see the actors doing it, these will be awkward.  Yeah.  The list of stations, Iraq's saying, because maybe we could just patch in individually. 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  I'll give it to Iraq.  Kenny's got a copy, too.  Okay.  How do we patch in?  I don't know.  We probably have to stream it.  Yeah.  We probably got to go find out where he's going to be.  Right.  And then pop up a website and see if we can listen live.  All right.  Where's Mars?  Oh, boy.  It's between Venus and...  We want to patch in.  We have to do it through the computer.  Yeah.  All right.  So we don't need Mars.  Why?  Why would we need Mars?  We just put up the station website.  You can say that in any situation.  That's exactly right.  We don't need Mars.  No.  But isn't there like a thing on Jimmy's end where it's always on and then we just patch into 
[01:40:30]  that part?  No, we can't.  So we got to do individual stations?  How are we going to keep up?  Yeah, because you'd have to patch into, I think, the radio, to actually into Premier's  feed, which is only going to those stations.  Yeah, but let's see what the Premier feed is and then we patch into that.  I don't know if we'll have access to that.  That's why we need Mars.  Oh, okay.  And that's why we got to ask permission.  Yeah, I don't think we'd have access to that because that's a different building.  I'm not doing it here.  I'm doing it on Fifth Avenue.  Ah.  Oh.  Whoa.  Fifth Avenue. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  The world famous Fifth Avenue.  Wow.  Whoa.  I'm going to do a little shopping.  Yeah, it's Mars.  Mars.  Yeah, we need permission to do an IP-corded connection.  Of course we do, Mars.  I knew that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  Oh, what?  IP-corded connection.  Why wouldn't they give us permission for that?  It's more people listening.  Oh, they would if you were to ask, I guess.  All right.  So how do we do this?  Uh, where is the, uh, executive producer of the show?  We don't have one. 
[01:41:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  There we go.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it for three years.  I thought it was you.  It was you.  Ain't you?  Ain't you?  Ain't you?  It'd be funny here, Jimmy, on like a whole bunch of different stations.  Oh, I'm not good on them, dude.  No, you rule.  Come on now.  I'm not good on those.  How about Mr. Gary?  Can he help?  I don't know.  Is he here today?  Exactly.  Exactly.  What do you need from Gary?  You see, I'm vacationing.  Head-waxing tips?  I believe he is here.  He is.  I believe.  I believe I could.  What? 
[01:42:00]  Where is he?  Oh, no.  Where is he shaking today?  What do you mean?  He gets a little nervous around us.  Oh.  Look at his hands.  It's hilarious.  Oh.  He's a good guy.  You know, it's, uh.  I really like him.  It's probably rage.  It's probably Gary's rage.  Rage.  I bet you he's a real brood at home.  He bats everybody around.  His neighbors are scared of him.  He's a fucking animal.  Shit rolls downhill.  You gotta shit on somebody.  That's right.  Or be shit on you.  Well, yeah.  Mars, could you take it upon yourself to go talk to Gary?  Yes.  I use proper names now that I'm a company guy. 
[01:42:30]  And ask him how we get this done.  Because we want to pipe in and see, or hear Jimmy do all these interviews.  Dude, I'm so bad on these.  It's embarrassing.  Absolutely.  Jimmy.  No, I really am.  I'm not good.  And they're all good.  They carry me through most of them.  I've just never been good with the phone or something.  Like, I'm too afraid I'm going to say something dirty or.  That is weird when you're on regular radio these days.  Like, it's very hard to.  Could you sneak in like a, like a con or something for us?  It would never make it out.  You could probably get the radio feed. 
[01:43:00]  Kevin and Bean were really good.  Like I said, I was in studio though.  In studio, I do great on these shows.  Like, I'm being in studio for radio shows, I have really a great time.  But on the phone, I suck a pile of dicks.  And then in studio for these TV studios, I'm terrible.  Are you terrible?  I fucking stink.  I love your little in studios.  Yeah, I'm never good.  It's always awkward.  So tell us about it. 
[01:43:30]  I shot it in Massachusetts.  There was one I watched where they just weren't getting like what you were saying.  Yeah, that could have been any one I've done.  But they get it.  They just reject it.  Oh, some woman.  Oh, what's this?  Not getting the jokes.  I don't have a picture of her.  It's just radio shows.  Nice.  Let's listen to her.  We can't listen to her now.  It's almost October.  Because, yeah, but these are the shows that he's going to do.  Jocktober.  Are we going to pump it up this year?  Or are we going to do Futurative Audio every day again? 
[01:44:00]  I mean, here's the thing with Jocktober.  Yes, Sam.  People are very excited.  There's actually a countdown that has started on Twitter.  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Oh, Jimmy.  Believe me, I hate to leave.  I wasn't going to do any radio.  I hate doing them.  And I don't like walking off this radio show.  Oh, who does?  However, I do try to promote this radio show on every other show that I'm on.  Did you promote my Twitter? 
[01:44:30]  We've got a list of stations, Lee, so we can probably...  Jimmy.  Okay.  So you cue us and say, all right, Jimmy's on this channel.  But you guys always forget that within the first week of Jocktober, you're sick of it.  So let's do it a little different.  No, we love it the whole time.  No, you don't.  How about you have Denny as kind of a consultant for Jocktober this year?  I think he should be the host of Jocktober.  Of course he should.  Hey, everybody.  And he should be...  He should be voicing Jocktober. 
[01:45:00]  He should be bringing in jingle packages.  He should be telling us, this is a great thing.  Like, instead of us just making fun of people, Denny should say, this is what you need to be more like.  Oh, no.  This is a fantastic segment they're doing here.  And once again, I got a lot of tweets from people going, Denny's not real, right?  No, he's...  Everything about him is absolutely authentic.  He absolutely collects jingle packages.  He is radio.  He collects bumper stickers.  And he collects bumper stickers.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Like, let me take on Denny as a partner this year.  Yeah, please.  Oh, wow.  Maybe we can mix it up.  Maybe he could suggest things that we're not hitting on for Jocktober.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Like, I want it, like, this year for Jock, it'll be, like, some of Denny's favorite things.  Yeah, I want, like, quick hits, too.  Yeah, me too.  Things.  But, yeah, he'll enjoy everything that we goof on.  No, it's good.  They're doing it at the top of the hour.  That's good.  That's good.  Oh.  Denny's coming in.  Oh, my God.  He's wearing a Not Sam shirt. 
[01:46:00]  Is he?  That's my guy.  Oh, God.  You got different Not Sam shirts?  Yeah.  He's listening to the radio.  Oh.  Yeah.  Ah, look, he's looking good today.  What's up, Denny?  Oh, man.  He's looking handsome.  How are you, gentlemen?  Not Sam shirt, huh?  Have you heard Jocktober over the years?  Yes.  What do you think?  That's cool.  How do we pump it up?  How do we pump it up?  How do we make it a little different this year?  You've always done morning shows, right?  That's really all you're going to get at radio stations.  What are we missing out on? 
[01:46:30]  What other things can we, like, exploit about radio and how awful it is?  I think we kind of cover it all the time.  I mean, you bang on it and hit on it all the time.  What if we do it once a week instead of every day?  You would be the worst consultant.  No, no, no, no, no.  Consultants' jobs, their job is to come into a market and tell you how awful you are or they don't get paid.  Exactly.  If you come in and go, God, you guys are great, everything is perfect, then the GM is going to cut you loose and say, well, we don't need a consultant anymore.  That's why I'm not a consultant.  I'm not a consultant. 
[01:47:00]  But I know the thing that Jimmy is going to do.  I used to do those.  I used to work for that company.  I used to do those.  Of course you did.  So what Jimmy is going to be, he's going to be in a studio, probably on a phone line or an ISDN, and they'll hook him up and they'll say, hey, we're live with Jimmy.  And they'll record it.  Chances are they're probably going to record it because they'll do it when they're in a stop set, when they're running commercials.  I don't know.  I got summer tape and summer live, it says.  Some, yeah.  Some, some.  It depends.  Yes, Iraq?  No, I was waiting on that.  But then he also used to do stuff for Premiere for radio tours. 
[01:47:30]  Right, that's what he said.  He used to handle all those.  Right.  I always hated this.  It's like, all right, let's go to the phones right now.  Hang it up.  I'd go like, ah, I don't know what to say.  I'm all fucked up.  We've done a few radio tours.  Yeah, we've done a lot.  And you know, we have Jim Norton.  We've done them too.  Right.  And I don't know if they're going to let you, you know, into the studio there.  I mean, yeah.  Why is Morris laughing?  You like Denny Morris?  You have to have the ISDN information. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need the ISDN.  Denny guy's full of himself.  We can't hack in.  I don't think so.  I don't think they're going to let you hack in.  That would be good to hack in.  We're going to hack in.  And Morris knows how to hack some shit, man.  I was walking by and he stopped me and said, hey, Mars, I used to do that in Premiere.  I know.  So he has a point of contact.  As long as I can help you guys.  I just thought I could have a little bit of a difference.  I have some numbers over there, some names.  We like your expertise.  Have you appreciated me being a company guy lately?  Yeah, you've been doing a great job.  It's been nice, right?  Yeah.  I mentioned listening to the channels. 
[01:48:30]  That was funny what you do with Roland.  Poor guy was sweating.  Oh, was he...  It was great.  Was he nervous about that Metallica thing?  Do you appreciate good, clean fun on the radio?  That was good, clean fun.  That was good, clean fun, right?  That was fun.  A little prank.  That was good.  It wasn't dirty.  No, no.  Nobody got hurt.  The whole family got hurt.  He was from the school of all's well that ends well.  Poor guy thought he was losing his job, but we knew he wasn't.  We knew he wasn't.  You would have loved our old PD who always insisted that we let everyone off the hook.  They got to be let off the hook. 
[01:49:00]  By the end of our pranks.  And we said, fuck that.  And we would just leave them hanging.  No, that was great.  He hated that we left people hanging.  That's not the way to do a good radio gag, though.  They got to get off the hook at the end.  You need some closure.  I think so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was funny.  Remember him coming in like beat red going, when are you going to tell people the April  Fool's prank is a prank?  Oh, yeah.  We'll get right on it.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get it.  And then 7 o'clock comes around and he's staring at us through the studio window waiting  for the big, okay, we're just fucking around.  And we did it.  And he goes, hi, baby. 
[01:49:30]  And we go, oh, we thought.  Was that Dave Dickless?  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, see, because we thought what you meant.  Come on, guys.  Oh, now, guys.  I think at one point he was trying to wrestle the microphones away from us to try to talk  himself.  Physical altercations.  God damn it, guys.  Can't have that.  And then we're just naive.  Oh, we thought.  We talked about this.  We thought tomorrow we let him off the hook so they could sit on it overnight.  Of course we're going to let him off the hook. 
[01:50:00]  We thought you meant tomorrow.  I meant right away.  No.  You knew what I meant.  He tried to make us feel disappointed.  That was his tone.  Or that we've disappointed him.  I forgot he took that tone.  You know what I meant, guys.  Because yelling didn't work with us.  Yeah.  You know exactly what I meant.  He'd do something like that.  Like, oh, now, come on, guys.  You know what I meant.  Right.  Oh, we were supposed to go, we feel so guilty now.  Meanwhile, we're like, yeah, good.  Fuck you.  Is the first station about to go with Jimmy? 
[01:50:30]  I think it actually starts at 9.  What is that about?  What's it got to strap in?  The car.  It's in a different building.  So the car picks him up at 8.30.  The car.  It's across the street.  Picks him up.  Isn't it?  The building next to Radio City.  Whoa.  Denny does that.  I think he deserves a car.  No, no, no.  Again.  Hey, it's right down the road, right across the street.  It's quicker than to cross the street than to drive in Midtown at this time of the morning.  Well, that's true.  We used to do that all the time.  They're coming from Fox, which is right across the street. 
[01:51:00]  Uh-huh.  And by the time they would come down 6th Avenue, it's like, we're waiting for these people to,  you know, to come up here.  Right.  They could have walked.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Another amazing story by Denny.  Yeah.  I love him.  My God.  He just gives and gives.  I'm shot full of him.  He just gives and gives.  I was talking to my daughter yesterday.  She said she heard from your sister.  Yes.  She said she was in.  She said Dawn was in the store.  They work for the same company.  Who knew that?  Fucking fascinating.  It's like we're related somehow.  I know.  I'm glad you didn't do that story off the air. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  No.  I was like, we got to save this for the air.  That was relatable.  Oh, you can relate to a story like that.  It was terrific.  You know how I sum that up?  Huh?  It's a small world.  It's a small world after all.  Yeah, yeah.  And Jim is not going across the street.  He's going several blocks away.  So he got a car service.  Oh, maybe because he's doing the TV also.  You should have given him a Not Sam shirt to wear on TV.  What, so he could wipe his ass with it and leave it here?  What's the first child he's talking to?  I'm not going to tell you.  You don't want to know what show it is.  Why?  Because it's free beer and hot wings. 
[01:52:00]  So?  You've made fun of them multiple times in the past.  Have we?  Yeah, whatever.  I don't recall that at all.  E-Rock?  Yeah, they're not fans.  Oh, they're not?  Why?  Where'd it go wrong?  A while ago.  Where'd it go wrong?  I've heard them say things.  Where'd it go wrong?  Oh, you've heard them say things.  So they started shit with us out of nowhere?  What the fuck?  Well, I don't know if that was the case, but where did it all go wrong?  Maybe we thought it was silly to have the name Free Beer and Hot Wings. 
[01:52:30]  Well, that was probably a consultant's job.  That their actual names on the air.  It's like, hey, hey, Free Beer.  How you doing, Hot Wings?  Who doesn't love Free Beer and Hot Wings?  Right.  Who doesn't love Free Beer and Hot Wings?  So they figured if they named themselves that.  Let's build a bridge today.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So build a bridge with them and also with Lewis and Floor Wax.  I want to call myself Sloppy Ass Sex.  Because who doesn't like Sloppy Ass Sex?  No one that I've met.  The Floor Wax dude's been around for a while. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah?  Floor Wax.  Yeah, he does a show with Lewis.  Lewis and Floor Wax.  Why would you call yourself Floor Wax, though?  I don't know.  That's a silly radio name.  Well, I'm Opie, so I got it.  Nah, but you were that before you even got into radio.  Twelve.  You were like, that was your name as a kid.  Yes.  So you grow up with it.  I'm sure at 12 years old, they weren't going, Floor Wax, it's dinner time.  Right.  Floor Wax.  Oh, Floor Wax.  Hi.  Is free beer here?  Could he come out and play? 
[01:53:30]  They weren't calling him that at that age.  Hot Wings, come over.  I got the new fucking...  Those are radio made-up names.  Let's ask Denny about radio made-up names.  That's kind of...  Some of the crazier ones.  Chuck Roast?  Our own Chuck Roast.  I always like Machine Gun Kelly.  And then they kind of...  He's a rapper.  No, no, no.  He was a top 40 disjointed.  No, he was a gangster back in the old days.  The 30s or 20s or something.  Then they kind of toned him down and made him M.G. Kelly. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, because Machine Guns are very...  Ew, because Machine Guns are...  Machine Gun Kelly.  That's not politically correct.  That's a great name.  Are we ready to go to Jimmy?  I'm Machine Gun Kelly.  Rumor has it we might be getting Jimmy time.  I am.  Very optimistic.  There's a decent chance that Dumber Than Zane Trivia gets played tomorrow when we're live  and Joe plays instead of Zane and everything gets all stupid.  Is this free beer and hot wings?  This is all going to be weird.  Jim Norton will join us at the top of the hour.  Lewis Black, an hour from now.  Top of the hour.  Fantasy Football is back.  Top of the hour. 
[01:54:30]  And DraftKings.com is celebrating with millions in cash prizes.  We're going to get our stuff together a little bit.  But that's...  I'm going to get...  No, he's doing a show at 8.45.  Yeah.  I'm certain he's doing an earlier show.  They might record him and just play him back.  Stop telling me.  It says if it's live or TV.  They might, though.  It always says that.  It always says that.  How about we change it on the fly?  How about we change it on the fly?  How about we change it on the fly?  How about we change it on the fly?  How about we change it on the fly?  Holy shit.  Change it on the fly.  They might cut out if he promotes your show.  Oh, that's true.  They got a dump button, man. 
[01:55:00]  They'll be like...  That Jim Norton, he's with that Opie and Anthony, and we don't want to promote them.  So, uh...  Now what?  Free Bear and Hot Wings are mad at us?  Who's this guy?  He is the intern.  He's been here all semester.  Are we getting him a cake tomorrow?  He's a good guy.  He does a nice job.  Today.  Did you give him a shirt?  He did not get a shirt.  You want a shirt?  Do you miss the girls?  I do.  Very much.  Yeah, who doesn't?  So do we.  Fucking sucks around here without the girls.  What?  Look at that lug. 
[01:55:30]  You guys are insulting him.  Are you going to be interviewing more interns?  Dude.  Some more young ladies?  I hope so.  Wasn't it nice to just have them around?  They were very nice.  Very nice girls.  Yeah.  You bring the content, man.  It's unbelievable.  Very nice girls.  You fucking bring the content.  Wow.  Content is king, Danny.  That's what it is.  Beautiful.  I got some in front of me, and I'm just too scared to fucking...  Oh, what is it?  It's a new E-Rock song.  I see it.  I've been holding back for two and a half hours. 
[01:56:00]  Trust me, I want to put this...  Wow, I want to hear this.  I want to play this at 6 a.m.  Dude, I got to hear it.  I know, but he gets really mad.  I got to tell you.  We've been getting along with E-Rock today.  I've heard it.  Everyone's been on the same page today.  It's a different Sean.  It's Sean B, not Sean F.  Oh, this is a different guy.  What?  It's Sean B.  Is he related to Sean F?  No.  They just have the same first name.  Oh.  But I will tell you...  So Sean B is dipping his toes into the E-Rock song thing?  Yes, he is.  That's going to piss off Sean F.  Sean B is not a nice person. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  So it's even worse than Sean F.  He is...  E-Rock's going to wish it was a Sean F song?  Oh, no.  Sean F may finally have his wish of E-Rock being his friend after E-Rock hears what Sean B did.  E-Rock, do I have your permission to play Sean B's new song?  Why not?  Because they're afraid to make a song about anybody else on this fucking show.  Go ahead.  Wow.  Are they afraid?  That was harsh.  Yeah.  Where's everybody else's song? 
[01:57:00]  I think they just know they'll get on the air if they do you.  It's all about me.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  It doesn't mean anything.  It means everything.  It means everything.  Why does it mean everything?  Because it's always me.  It's always you?  Every promo, every fucking sweeper, fucking half-ass parody songs that the fans think they  can do, it's always me. 
[01:57:30]  Who's laughing in there?  Sal.  He is right.  He's a good sport about it, though.  And he's making sense now.  He is making sense.  When you're right, you're right.  It really is.  Can't really argue that point.  Are you saying the listeners have picked up on some of the habits of the show staff and  talent?  No, they didn't pick up.  They just heard that guy chuckling over there all the time and go, oh, I'll make Opie happy,  I'll make another song.  So you're saying all of us in production and all the listeners that make parody songs know  that the easy out to just get a rap on the show is to make fun of you? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, that's lazy, right, E-Rock?  Yes, it's very lazy.  I think it's lazy, too.  Now, were you planning on playing the song?  That's not going to stop him.  Only if E-Rock gives me permission.  That's cool of you.  Oh, man.  E-Rock?  I don't know if I know this song.  Some kind of skeptical.  You don't know the song.  It's new.  Sort of like a premiere.  A worldwide premiere.  Shut up!  You didn't bring that into the music meeting? 
[01:58:30]  It took you long, man.  To say that.  Sort of like a premiere.  A premiere.  A worldwide premiere.  What's a worldwide premiere, Danny?  Just playing that song for the first time.  Nobody else has heard it.  You really got to talk those up, right?  You tease them.  You can't do those anymore because of the internet.  But back in the day, a radio station would get the song before anyone else.  That happened last week when the Katy Perry song leaked.  Yeah.  Back in the old days, man, these record guys would come into a city and decide which rock 
[01:59:00]  station would get the big fucking premiere.  And it would upset the other rock station.  But then they would do something nice for the other rock station to make it all even.  It's like when you go into a supermarket and you see the front, somebody's got Coke.  This week they've got Pepsi.  You know, so it's a fair share.  Everybody gets...  You ever get some of that cocaine back in the day?  No, I never did that.  Oh, no.  Don't do that stuff.  No.  Just give me my black coffee and I'll be percolating in the morning for you.  Uh-huh.  You know about it, though, right?  Oh, I've heard about it, yeah.  The plug all in the payola?  Yeah.  A little envelope of Coke?  Yep. 
[01:59:30]  Play our record.  Which jock did the blow?  I don't know it.  I would walk out of the studio when they were doing that kind of stuff.  What a fuddy-duddy he must have been back in the day.  I don't play that way.  Oh, God.  Dennis is leaving again.  And that's why you're poor and nowhere in this business.  You had to do a little Coke back in the day.  Yeah, man.  Back to the show that you were one of the guys.  Never did that once.  If you wanted the brand new Yes song.  You're in.  I was at a college radio convention and they were passing by, yeah.  Oh, God!  Back in the day with the IBS, the International Broadcasting System. 
[02:00:00]  No, it gave you IBS.  It's a problem.  And they were passing.  We were all sitting around listening to the new Joe Jackson album at the time.  Oh, wow.  That's exciting.  Which one?  It was Look Sharp.  No, no.  That would be 1984.  Real estate to Look Sharp, which was the early one.  You gotta look sharp, sharp.  You gotta look sharp, sharp.  And they were passing around a marijuana cigarette.  Hold on.  Hold on.  A hash oil.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Joe Jackson, very, very overrated.  Thank you. 
[02:00:30]  Now continue.  Okay.  And they were passing it around the room in a circle.  And they came to me.  And I said, no, thank you.  And I dropped it on the floor and just.  Oh, what a what?  You stomped it out.  And like 20 guys, like all pile on the rabbit.  It was like.  How are you doing?  How about you fucking pass it to your right?  Just pass it if you don't want to be pushing it out like that.  Sort of like hot potato.  Just pass it on the right when the music stops, right?  Why would you stomp out the fucking marijuana?  Just say no to drugs.  This is called like.  Denny. 
[02:01:00]  Dennis, here you go, man.  No, thanks.  Dude, what the fuck are you doing?  Bam, bam.  Not into that stuff.  Not cool, man.  You're gonna go nowhere in this fucking business, man.  It was a mushy cigarette.  It was wet.  You don't stomp out my fucking dube.  Not cool, man.  Sorry.  Why would you do that?  Because I don't.  I don't partake in that stuff.  Pass it.  Pass it to the right.  Is that worse than actually going to a college radio convention?  I don't know.  The whole story is reeks.  It reeks of fucking horrible things. 
[02:01:30]  Where was the college radio convention?  Washington, D.C.  You got to go to Washington.  That's kind of cool.  Why wouldn't you just say no thank you and pass it?  Like, why do you have to ruin other people's good times if you don't want to partake?  I just thought it was a mushy cigarette.  And I said no thanks and threw it on the floor.  And some guy goes, no, that's marijuana soaked in hash oil.  Marijuana.  Soaked in hash oil.  Man, you really fucked that up.  Yeah.  That's not my scene.  Not my bag.  Not my bag. 
[02:02:00]  You're gonna go nowhere in this business like that, man.  Man.  And then look, they were right.  I'm happy.  I'm happy.  He's almost made it.  I'm happy.  You're doing fine.  He's dead now.  He's 20 years into his almost made it career.  He's on the road, though.  You're on the road.  He's like me.  I'm gonna be there.  He's doing fine.  Now that I'm going around the channels, I still haven't heard Denny on SiriusXN.  Sunday nights on the 60s channel.  60s on 6 on Sunday night.  What time?  Can you hear Denny?  9 o'clock Eastern time. 
[02:02:30]  9 east.  Do you voice track your shift?  No, I come in on Sunday.  And I come in on Sunday and take care of it.  I don't call it a shift.  I always call it a show.  Right.  A shift is when you're unloading a truck.  We've gone through this.  I know, but it's a shift.  It's a show.  It's a show.  What do you say?  Or a radio program.  What do you say between the records where someone out there goes, oh, this Denny guy?  Well, I try to stretch the weekend out a bit longer.  Keep it going.  It's Sunday night.  6M, Sounds of Summer.  And here's one from the summer of 1967. 
[02:03:00]  How do you stretch out the weekend?  Well, it's a subliminal thing by saying, hey, you know, these great songs just making you feel better on the drive home, wherever you might be driving home from, the beach, the park, the barbecue.  You have that weird shift, though, because people are starting to think, ah, the weekend's over, Monday morning mindset.  Well, it's 6 o'clock on the left coast.  You've got to start, you know, you've got to keep people there.  And it's TV night.  Like, every major show is on Sunday night.  Right, exactly.  Who's listening?  Exactly.  Who's listening?  You know what?  I'm just happy to be a part of it.  I think you have to sound as good at 9 o'clock at night as you do at 9 in the morning or 2 in the morning or 2 in the afternoon. 
[02:03:30]  I am.  You never know who's listening.  That's exactly right.  You're still wondering who's listening, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  It is an important shift.  That's stretching out the weekend.  Stretching out the weekend.  That's something not a lot of people can do.  That is a talent right there because you can't just stretch out the weekend.  You've got to know what to say to the people to make them forget that it's Sunday night.  And I cross-promote what's happening on the other channels on Monday.  Oh, good.  I am.  Coming up, what?  What would you say?  Well, if there was something happening on Road Dog or it was happening on the Jimmy Buffett channel, Margaritaville, Jimmy came out with his new albums. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, nothing's happening on the Jimmy Buffett channel.  That's a great channel.  I mean, it's always summer.  I've been tuning in every morning on the way in.  It's always summer.  Yeah, it's good stuff.  Nothing really is happening.  Jimmy's out at Jones Beach, I believe, tonight.  Right?  I have no idea.  You've never gone to a Buffett concert?  I went to two Buffett concerts.  Yeah.  I liked them a lot.  Yeah.  Wow.  But not enough to listen to them on...  You're not a parrot head?  No, no.  He's got a casino now in Atlantic City.  I am. 
[02:04:30]  Do you want to hear his newest song?  Went on that one.  Not yet.  I'm monitoring over here.  There's a lot of them.  Is this the first challenge he's going on?  This is the first one.  I'll give you a heads up.  All right.  I'm going to hear Jimmy in a minute or two, hopefully.  I hope.  Do we have time to do the other thing?  No, we don't.  Did we get permission from E-Rock officially?  E-Rock, I'm telling you, this one's mean.  Oh.  Wow.  I will say that this one is...  Sam is saying it's mean.  I was listening this morning, and I was chuckling, but I was also like, what the fuck?  Let me ask.  Do they talk about weight? 
[02:05:00]  It's mentioned.  All right.  It's mentioned.  All right.  If it's just mentioned, then it's passing.  But it's also like...  Is anything mentioned about his work ethic?  I don't remember if his work ethic is mentioned, but the way loved ones feel about him and the  outcome that they would like to see happen is mentioned.  Is this a case of a listener taking it too far?  I mean, I'll let you guys be the judge.  I don't think it's too far, but I definitely think it's mean. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  It's not Sean F.  No.  I want to hear it so bad.  Because it's not attacking loved ones.  That is too far.  But...  Yeah.  It starts out nice.  Wow, that sounds nice.  It's mellow.  That's nice.  A little acoustic guitar.  Is that Beatles?  Sounds a little Beatley.  Is this Blackbird?  Blackbird.  Yeah, it is.  All right.  I can almost tell what they're going to say.  You have like an album of these songs, right? 
[02:06:00]  There's so many of them.  Sean F. has done quite a few.  Wow.  This is Sean B., though.  What do you think, Sean?  It's a shame because he's such a nice guy.  You rock too.  What do you think of mean-spirited radio, Danny?  Mean-spirited radio?  I don't like it.  Oh.  I don't like it.  Why don't you like it?  What's that?  Because to me, radio is an escapism.  Right.  Entertainment.  I mean, if people are into that, fine.  But again, it's not my cup of tea.  I think I know where he goes with this.  You do? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I think I know where he goes.  Slab while eating in the dead of life.  Sneaks into the kitchen for a bite.  And his wife is hoping that that fatso has a heart attack and dies.  What the fuck?  That's not my cup.  That's not my cup.  No, no, no, no.  That crosses the line right now.  That is-  What the fuck?  No, no, no.  Denny, is that even fun? 
[02:07:00]  That's not fun.  No.  That's not even fun.  No.  No.  Oh, man.  Like, what the fuck?  Does he redeem himself, at least?  Wow.  Let's find out.  If redeem means repeat.  Pretty pickin' right there.  Slab while eating in the dead of life.  Start from the beginning.  It's no wonder why his clothes fit tight.  All his life.  He's been eating goldfish pizzas, donuts, and some fries. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, that's nice.  Nice, right?  Slab while eating.  Till you can't even see your feet.  Sounds like Napoleon Dynamite's brother.  Kip?  Yeah.  Sounds like Kip singing.  Slab while eating in the dead of life.  He's gonna do this all day.  He has to buy an extra seat to fly. 
[02:08:00]  All his life.  Eric, please don't lose the weight.  We're hoping that you'll die.  Oh, that's not.  That's not.  Come on.  That's not.  That's mean spirit.  What the fuck, dude?  That's off-roading right there, man.  You gotta keep it between the lines.  Right, Denny?  Yeah, that's not nice.  That's not.  Poor guy would die.  Come on.  There's a line between funny and mean, and the listener knows that.  Yeah.  That's just.  Yeah.  I don't want that to happen.  Let's see if he understands that.  All right.  Oh, so you're gonna keep playing it? 
[02:08:30]  Oh, and you had to back it up.  Thanks.  I didn't know he was gonna say it twice.  Jesus.  Yeah, he did.  He said it twice, to be fair to him.  To be fair to Opie, he said it twice.  Wow.  He didn't back it up.  No, he didn't back it up for real.  That's mean.  He said it twice.  No, I would just edit that part out.  Oh.  Do a little radio edit?  Yeah, a little edit.  I've heard that before.  They've edited things.  What are some of the great songs that were edited by AM Radio?  Charlie Daniels, right? 
[02:09:00]  Devil Went Down to Georgia.  I told you once, you son of a bitch.  Whoa.  And then they had, I told you once, you son of a gun.  Son of a gun.  Big Bad John.  Big Bad John.  At the bottom of his mind lives a hell of a man.  Oh, wow.  They didn't like hell in there.  So what did they say?  Heck?  I think they said heck.  I think they said dumb one.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, this was the early 60s.  What about Johnny Cash, right?  The boy named Sid?  Did they mention something nasty in there?  Did they curse in that one?  Well, Blinded by the Light. 
[02:09:30]  Remember?  Because they thought it was saying douche.  Well, they weren't really saying.  They were saying douche.  And I had like four versions of the who.  Who are you?  Oh, who the fuck are you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can't play that, can you?  No.  Well, who the fuck are you?  So what did they do there?  Who are you?  They either edited it out or they just faded it.  Oh, man, I worked that up.  Sometimes they just.  They let it go.  I played that enough.  Yeah.  Where they just didn't care about that one.  I recall, I've said it before on the air, my dad, oh boy, did he get mad. 
[02:10:00]  He didn't like the salty language?  No, not on the radio.  And when, who the hell was it?  Simon and Garfunkel.  Yeah.  When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  My father looked at the radio and he was like, I don't like that.  I was coming back from a Boy Scout trip with a bunch of Boy Scouts and the Scoutmaster  was in the front seat.  And that came on the air.  Were you the sucky or the.  Oh, Jimmy's on.  Jimmy's on.  I know you're a fan.  I still know really how.  I mean, he's. 
[02:10:30]  He hates him.  Yeah, he's raw and he's edgy.  But he's honest, man.  And I love it.  He's not afraid to say whatever the hell he thinks.  And he's a good follow on Twitter.  Great follow on Twitter.  He's part of the Open Anthony Show on XM Sirius Satellite Radio.  Oh.  Or is it Sirius XM?  Whatever.  You know, satellite radio.  Right.  Yeah.  Jim Norton's actually.  Is he ready to go, Patrico?  All set.  All right.  Oh, here's Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Hey, what's going on?  Hi, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  It's us.  Hi. 
[02:11:00]  Jimmy.  Hey, can you hear me, Jimmy?  Jim.  I'm happy to be on the show.  Jimmy.  He's got a message from Jimmy's people because he's got this Epix comedy special.  You remember Please Be Offended?  That came out, what, last year, right?  Yeah, it's actually coming out on DVD yesterday, I think.  It came out on DVD, but this is a new one.  Yeah, so he's got a new special, American Degenerate.  And so, you know, they want to get some promotion out for it.  And, of course, I mean, this is the perfect place to go.  I have a, like, borderline man crush.  I just think he's seriously, like, one of the funniest people on the planet.  I tell you, then you'd be totally jealous. 
[02:11:30]  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Have you seen the ads that Epix has been running for the special?  So Jim's making out with this really old chick, like, really, like, shoving his tongue  down her throat.  Who's the Hulk?  Are they showing that?  I'm so happy.  I'm happy they're showing that one.  Where me and the old lady are on the floor.  Yeah, and the family's there, disgusted.  And, you know, we had to do about 12 takes of that.  And I have to say, because, you know, I'm as creeped out by old people as everyone is.  I mean, nobody likes being around them.  Hey, that's not nice.  They do.  They're terrible.  It's like talking to a dead person. 
[02:12:00]  But she smelled great.  Like, she had amazingly fresh breath.  I was so happy.  Well, how old was she?  She had to be in her 60s.  26?  She's probably about 68 to 70.  And I was like, oh, God, her mouth is going to smell like just a corpse.  Yeah, I was trying to think of a radio clean word.  She said corpse.  Thank you very much.  I'm assuming she was cast, though.  Like, you were looking for, like, a really old-looking, beat-up lady, right? 
[02:12:30]  I mean.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't cast her, but I wanted an old lady.  And I chew a lot of gum because I used to smoke.  And when we're on the floor making out and she's under me, my gum almost fell out into her mouth.  And I'm like, I'm going to drop my gum into this old lady's mouth and choke her to death.  Like, which would be a lawsuit, but it would be such great promotion for the special.  You know, like, old lady dies during sexual liaison for the special promotion.  There's some people that are vomiting in their mouth.  But anybody that knows Jim Norton has heard his comedy.  I mean, I've read your books and everything else.  They have to.  Hey, hey.  He's done some pretty degenerate stuff. 
[02:13:00]  I mean, American Degenerate really sums it up.  I mean, the nasty, disgusting, sexual stuff.  Yeah, I mean, I've been a bit of a pig.  Yeah.  A bit of a pig.  Yeah, I think the difference is I talk about it.  A lot of people do the same stuff I do.  They just don't talk about it.  I mean, it's like, a lot of people don't want, what's that?  Do they, though?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, look, have you never gotten a prostitute and then made a gender error?  Like, oh, what the heck?  Why not?  You're already there.  You've already paid. 
[02:13:30]  What, are you going to ask for her manager or his manager?  No, no.  You always got to check for the Adam's apple.  Oh, my God.  You know, looking for the Adam's apple, it just seems rude.  And no woman wants to do that.  What are you going to do if you pick up a hooker in a scarf?  You know, because you take that off.  You know, sometimes you've just got to kind of muscle on through, you know, and laugh about it later on the way home as you're questioning everything.  So, I mean, please be offended, obviously.  I mean, you can tell just by the title of that one that it was going to be raw and in your face and politically incorrect and everything else.  You can tell they're just not dumb. 
[02:14:00]  It's kind of going more into, like, some of those personal stories that we know about you and the, you know, transgender hookers and different, you know, there's a lot of things we can't say on the radio.  Oh, I understand.  God, what can't you say, transgender?  Is that more the tone of this special?  It's always in my stuff because whenever I attack somebody or make fun of somebody, like, whether, and please be offended, it was Mel Gibson and Tiger Woods.  And in this special, I talk about Travolta and his massages.  I have to relate my own experience to it. 
[02:14:30]  Hey, hey, easy with Travolta.  To me, like, nobody kind of rats on themselves when they mock celebrities, so I try to tell on myself, like, yeah, I'll make fun of Tiger Woods, but I'm also a...  Hey, hey, that's racist.  Same thing with Travolta.  Be safe.  Be safe.  I have a lot of happy ending massage experience, so I know exactly what was happening in those rooms because I've been through it.  So, I think I talk about my own...  What's that?  Anthony Wiener.  Like, that kind of stuff.  Careful.  This was taped before Wiener came back.  Oh, okay.  Wiener came.  Uh-oh.  Edit that.  Every other photo on my phone looks like a small grain silo with two giant feet behind it. 
[02:15:00]  I know exactly why he took that photo.  Angles.  Yeah.  He did it for the same reason every man does it.  It's because you have a camera.  That's the first thing you should take a picture of.  Dong?  Yeah, of course.  But does that ever work?  Like, you hear these stories about guys in parking lots and they just expose themselves to chicks.  I mean, has there ever been a documented case where, like, a guy whips his wiener out and women are like, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I need that right now. 
[02:15:30]  And they just drop to their knees.  But here's why it's not documented.  Because if a woman likes it, she's not going to report it.  Like, no woman is going to walk into work and go, guess what a whore I was on this plane.  That's true.  You know, they just kind of keep it under their head.  Easy with the language.  That's true.  I mean, sending a random dong pic to a random chick, is that really going to work?  No, probably not.  But you don't send it to a random girl.  Because if you have her number, she's probably giving it to you.  It's like, I wouldn't send it to, like, the way I'll do it is I'll always kind of ask as a joke.  Like, hey, do you want a picture of it?  LOL.  LOL. 
[02:16:00]  And then, like, I just send it.  And then if she responds, hopefully, yes, it's on its way.  And if she responds, no, I'm like, oh, sorry, I didn't get that.  So I assume that your lack of response was a yes.  And what is she going to do?  Just delete it?  Who cares?  Or are you going to say, I meant to text that to my mom.  Right.  Sorry, wrong person.  I got enough shots.  This makes me appreciate satellite radio.  You know, the thing is, we knew it was so stupid because he kept his face.  Like, that was the creepy part.  It wasn't even the below-the-waist shots.  It was all those pictures of him in the Congress locker, you know, like, kind of grabbing himself with his towel on. 
[02:16:30]  He just looked like a serial rapist because his face was in them.  You never put your face in those photos.  I mean, that guy's got a lot of – I mean, are you a confident guy?  I don't – you don't really put out a lot of confidence.  It's a lot of self-deprecating stuff.  But, like, Anthony Weiner, this guy's got to be confident.  Because every time he comes up on the news or a picture, my wife sees and goes, oh, my God.  He is just an awkward-looking dude.  But he's a great politician because he's confident.  You're right.  Yeah.  Like, I have very little confidence, justifiably so. 
[02:17:00]  Like, I should have very little confidence.  It's so hard to –  He looks like –  Not cursed.  He looks like a big ragu from Laverne and Shirley, but with cancer.  Like, he's just gross-looking.  Jesus.  He looks like a big, dumb nose and a little arm.  But he's a good talker, and his confidence convinces you that your perception of him is wrong,  and that he's really got it all going on.  That's the beauty of confident men.  It's called being a shyster.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a shyster.  He seems like one.  And I like the fact that, I mean, watching him here in New York, he just won't give up. 
[02:17:30]  He won't – he doesn't care anymore.  He's kind of – you know, he knows it's all out there.  So now he's just plowing right ahead.  He's calling old candidates, Grandpa.  He's dropping F-bombs.  He's really entertaining.  How do you not want him mayor?  Yeah, he's become like the rent is too high guy, where it's like the guy's got no real shot,  but it's at least entertaining.  Do you know – that guy's name was Jimmy something.  We interviewed him on Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, good one, Jimmy.  He wasn't as crazy as you'd think.  Like, the rent too high, whatever it was his catchphrase was. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  But then you're like, you know what?  This guy kind of makes a little more sense than I – Jimmy McMillan or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy McMillan.  And, you know, we have Bloomberg exiting here in New York, and it's a weird thing.  Like, I've been bashing him for over 10 years, and I kind of realized that I like him now.  Like, you know what I mean?  He's kind of like – all he's done is kind of attack fat people, and he's spying on mosques,  and he's stopping and arresting everybody.  Like, the guy's a real – he's a creep, and I kind of wish I hadn't been bashing him.  You know what's a dick or an asshole?  Real quick, let's plug the special. 
[02:18:30]  American Degenerate on Epix premieres tomorrow night.  The website is epixhd.com, and you can even sign up and get a 14-day trial of Epix.  I mean, canceled afterwards if you want to, but that way you don't miss the show tomorrow night  if you want to see Jim Norton, American Degenerate, the new special.  We have the same agent.  Oh, Bob, that's –  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Sorry.  I have sympathy for him.  I guess you've got an advance of the special, and he's like, dude, for no other reason to watch the special,  he goes, the opening – the opening segment of the special.  He didn't say it like that.  He won't tell me what that is.  You got to watch.  Well, I mean, Jim, apparently it's can't miss. 
[02:19:00]  Without giving too much away, like, what do you talk about first?  Well, I mean, I tweeted the opening, so it's okay to talk about it.  This is just a scene where I'm on my – I'm nude with my pants around my ankles,  and I'll say this carefully.  Let's just say, and I have – my hands are taped and my mouth is taped,  and you see a black hand come into frame on my shoulder.  And then somebody comes in and makes a remark, and he kisses and licks my head,  and you realize that things have been happening, and, oh, look, something's painted on my back. 
[02:19:30]  It's a very, very – it's a fairly graphic opening with a fairly recognizable black iconic TV character  who I love, and everybody who knows me knows I love him.  So it was great that I got this guy to do it.  It's just like Bob, you know, is our agent, and this guy, he's an old guy.  He's got no sense of humor whatsoever, and if he finds it funny, it's got to be really funny.  Our agent is a dead person.  He really is.  It's like Unopin' Anthony, whenever they talk about him, they play musical music. 
[02:20:00]  He literally is a cadaver.  Super nice guy, though.  He's a great guy.  Super nice guy.  Hi, great guy.  But a lot of – of course he's a nice guy.  He's the Grim Reaper.  He's always nice.  He does nothing but tap people on the shoulder and give them bad news.  And he plays the French horn in his garage.  He's an absolute, like, creep.  He plays the French horn?  He does.  You didn't know that?  He's way into, like, classical music and stuff, and so, like, you know, you go over to his house,  and his, like, kids are there, like, almost like hostages.  Yeah, and they have to listen to his awful French horn. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, my God.  He does.  He torches him with it.  Yeah, like, let's just make Dad feel good about this before he hangs himself off the banister.  I mean, besides the honesty and everything else,  the other thing I always like about Jim Norton and why he's such a fun follow on Twitter,  especially if you're into, like, news and current events,  are you just, like, reading stuff constantly?  Are you that interested, or are you just – is it more just preparation for your comedy?  Like, you read this stuff, and you get into, you know, Al Sharpton about stuff,  or you get into, you know, whatever the politically correct case of the day is,  especially – and I so agree with him on this one – you know, every time – 
[02:21:00]  and we brought it up before, but there was a bullying story here in St. Louis  where it was the white kid, they got beat up by, like, a whole bunch of black kids on the bus.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they said that that was just – they were just, like, pranking him.  Or not pranking him.  They were just, like, oh, it wasn't racially motivated.  It's a hell of a prank.  Yeah, they were just joking.  It wasn't racially motivated.  But, you know, the tables had been turned.  Or if there's somebody that gets rolled by a couple black guys, you know,  they will never say that it was black guys.  It was just, you know, rambunctious youths.  Or teens. 
[02:21:30]  Teens is the code word.  And you know what?  That's not black people doing it.  That's the white press.  And I have such a visceral hatred for the media and the fact that they don't –  this is not about the justice system.  Black people are treated very harshly in the justice system.  My only attacks are on the media.  And they do not report the racial motivation of black on white.  It's almost like they expect black people to behave that way.  It's really a frustrating, like, white elitism.  So, yeah, I attack that a lot.  Oh, even today you tweeted out, I think, the cover of the Daily News something. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was just them endorsing stupid Christina Quinn here.  And I don't really care if they endorse someone.  But how can the press – how can they endorse somebody?  Well, I tweeted out a picture in the post of this shooting of this poor Australian baseball player.  That's what I want.  That's a terrible story.  And they're harping on the board angle.  That's a terrible story.  Like, literally, they're not looking at the back.  I think you reiterated that.  This one kid had tweeted how he hates white people.  And then he goes out and shoots one.  And the media's like, ah, you know, the youth is bored.  And then Jesse Jackson tweets that that type of violence is frowned upon. 
[02:22:30]  Ooh, way to use harsh language.  Why not just call them fresh or naughty teens?  Dude, I've got to run because I've got live TV coming up.  Oh, cool.  I really appreciate you guys having me on, though.  Bob talked – I wish I had called in earlier, but I had to walk to this place that I'm at right now.  No, it's all good, man.  Well, thank you.  Hey, you know, I'd be curious.  Did you get into – I must have missed it.  I know you've got to go.  But the Missouri rodeo thing?  I did not.  Oh, with the Obama thing?  Yeah, big deal or not a big deal.  That's all we need to know. 
[02:23:00]  I don't care, to be honest.  It's not a big deal because if it was George Bush they were mocking, nobody would care.  Right.  That's what we said.  Cool.  I knew that.  We're on the same page.  Fantastic.  People were calling us racist for it.  Thank you, guys.  I look forward to seeing you guys in person.  Of course.  All right, Jim Norton.  Thanks, man.  See you soon.  All right.  Jim Norton, American Degenerate on Epix.  It's premiering tomorrow night's new special.  The website is epix.  Let's see what they say about it.  epixhd.com.  Like I said, sign up for the 14-day trial so you don't miss the show tomorrow night.  And then after the 14-day trial, canceled if you don't like it.  Dude, I know you don't like books.  I know. 
[02:23:30]  I love the idea of books.  I buy books with the intention of reading them.  And then I'm like, eh.  Did you read this, his book, I Hate Your Guts?  Yes.  Dude, that is.  It came out a couple years ago.  Remember we were talking about, like, what's the last book you read?  I think I read Artie Lang's book.  Should we move to the next show?  Too Fatty Fish, I read that.  Yeah.  And then right before that.  Is he or is he doing TV?  No, he's got another radio show.  He lied?  I think he was just incorrect.  Or maybe.  $25,000.  I forget what it's called.  I got to say, what was that show?  That show was called Woody and Rizzuto. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, they were really good.  We're always beating up radio guys.  They were pretty good.  Yeah, they did a good job with Jimmy.  They sounded good.  Unfortunately, they got a hole in the bag.  They got to have a hole.  I heard her giggling, and then she fucking probably went to take her tampon out, because  I didn't hear her at the end.  You know, because that's what girls do.  They got to take out their tampons.  Next on schedule is Free Beer and Hot Wings. 
[02:24:30]  Ah, they don't like us.  Well, you said terrible things about me.  When's he going to be on TV?  I don't think we did.  I don't think we said anything bad about Free Beer and Hot Wings.  I don't remember, man.  Everyone loves Free Beer and Hot Wings.  Oh, the show!  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, see, I thought when you said...  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  I think Jimmy's doing our show today.  I know, right?  That was fun to listen to.  It really was.  I kind of enjoyed that.  I want to hear how similar the interviews are, too. 
[02:25:00]  Although Jimmy mixes it up good, but sometimes it's hard with these radio guys.  Right.  Should we take a break, or are we going to miss out?  If you take a break, you'll miss this show.  You sure?  Most of it.  It starts at 9.  Well, it's 9.02.  Oh, man.  True.  So we should take a break.  Does it sound like they're ready to go?  It does sound like they're ready to go.  Are they promoing it?  Later on today, with the audio of that reporter where the person who was against oil decided  to fart in her face in order to repel her from asking him questions. 
[02:25:30]  That's pretty awesome.  Do you think Jimmy's sitting there going?  We're playing Top Jimmy.  Jim Norton.  Oh!  There he is.  Down the Opie and Anthony show.  Great comedian.  He's got a brand new special airing tomorrow night.  Jimmy, we're listening!  Jimmy!  Jim!  Jim!  Jim!  Hi, Jim, welcome back to the show.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, can you guys hear me?  We're just working on the audio.  Yeah, sounds good.  Sounds good.  Okay, great, man.  By the way, who farted into someone's face to protest something? 
[02:26:00]  It's some Canadian group of protesters who are anti-oil, and it's sort of like the Occupy  Wall Street gang, where instead of answering questions, they scream in your face and bang  on drums and just be repulsive.  How can anybody be anti-oil?  It's pretty tough, right?  I know.  I've always found that to be odd.  Yeah.  Everybody utilizes it.  Being anti-oil is really a smart idea until you have a girlfriend with a strap on and  you're screaming in pain. 
[02:26:30]  I apologize.  I hear an echo, so if I keep stopping myself, it's because I hear myself twice.  So I'm sorry if I keep stopping.  Double good, man.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's that XM technology.  Not that it won't be annoying for you, but we don't hear it on this end.  Okay.  I keep thinking I'm interrupting or stepping on one of you guys, and I'm like, oh, it's  my own dumb voice.  Oh, now it's gone.  Okay, cool.  Well, if you step on one of us, it's still an improvement, so we're good with that.  Jim Norton.  Courtesy laugh.  At Jim Norton on Twitter, JimNorton.com.  Jim, I wanted to tell you, obviously we'll talk about the special coming up tomorrow night 
[02:27:00]  on Epyx TV, but you did something recently, and I've always thought you were really funny,  but I was so impressed by this, and that was when there was the blog that was posted, the  column that was posted on Jezebel.com, and I forget her name.  Or Lindy West.  Where Lindy West had said there was no room and never the right time to make a funny rape  joke, that it was always inappropriate, and she had a variety of reasons, and you ended  up going on television to debate her, and just the very point of someone saying, okay, 
[02:27:30]  well, I'll be the guy who's pro-rape joke, which sounds terrible, but you went on there  and, boy, you handled yourself so well.  It was really impressive, and I want to recognize that.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  It's weird.  It's like it's so easy to go on and yell at each other, and all these news pundits do  it.  And you ever watch a talking head show?  It's just one guy's liberal, one guy's conservative.  Blah, blah, blah.  What about the Congress?  Blah, blah, blah.  Right?  I mean, like, oh, this stinks.  It's unwatchable, so I didn't want to get into a screaming match with her, and as a 
[02:28:00]  comic, it's not hard to defend doing whatever you want to do, because you know how it is  on the radio.  If you do certain ethnicities, you get dumped out of, or you get in trouble, or if you do  certain subject matters, you get in trouble, and you just get sick of it after a while.  So rape jokes, hey, look, I know a lot of people aren't going to love them, but there's  no way as a comedian I'm going to edit an entire piece of human behavior out of the  out of the possible arsenal of things I'm going to talk about.  Yeah, and for those who didn't see it, I know you can find it on, I'm guessing it's on YouTube. 
[02:28:30]  I saw it when Jim had tweeted it on Twitter, but I'm sure you can still find it.  It was, is it the, what was the show it was on?  I'm sorry.  Oh, it's W. Kamau Bell.  That's right.  And he's on FX, and I used to say, you know, Jim Norton rape, and that usually tends to  come up.  If it's not going to be my radio contract, it'll be my debate with you.  That's very funny.  But the point you made about it not being like other screaming, talking head debates  where they're not listening or whatever, this was an actual, like, the way it's drawn  up debate, not like Lincoln Douglas or anything like that, but it was, it was well done for 
[02:29:00]  both of you.  And then you did something else afterwards where some, some of your fans or some fans of  the radio show were going after her, uh, and, and tweeting terrible things about her.  And then you went on, on Twitter and said, Hey, you know what?  That's, that's totally against what I was trying to do.  We're debating, you know, what's, what's okay for freedom of speech and for, for entertainment.  And I don't like to tell people what to say.  Like, I'll never tell like Opie and Anthony fans or Jim Norton fans, Hey guys, don't, but it  was almost like what they were saying is, Hey, I hope you get raped.  And then people who are on Lindy's side would say, well, that strengthens the argument for 
[02:29:30]  rape culture, but it really doesn't because what was happening is they were just rebelling  against what they saw as an argument against free speech.  Like if she and I had been talking about drunk driving jokes, all those people would not  have went on and said, get raped.  They would have went on and said, I hope you're killed by a drunk driver.  They were just taking the subject that we were discussing.  They didn't agree with her.  So they were trying to hurt her with that subject.  But they would have done that with whatever the subject was.  But I was like, you know, she was nice and I liked her personally. 
[02:30:00]  And I didn't want to see her getting attached so badly for just expressing an opinion that  a lot of people have.  Do you think she appreciated the respectful way you handled it?  I think so.  And her boyfriend I actually liked too, sent me a nice tweet and said, man, you've been  really nice to this.  And it was like, I didn't feel like I was doing anything special.  I mean, when you debate somebody, if it's a pleasant debate, you're not supposed to go on line  and bash them after.  Why aren't these guys asking the pertinent questions?  She was nice.  We had a nice talk and the heart-hitting question.  She's the only person in the country with this opinion.  Right.  And if I am mean to her, then this opinion goes away. 
[02:30:30]  There's a lot of people that have this.  I mean, how many letters have you guys gotten or complaints to management about something  you make fun of?  It's never going to end.  Every second.  There has to be a way to navigate it without wanting to pick up a hammer and chase somebody  with it.  That's why they don't let me respond anymore.  Because it's always that way.  It's always a big, makes it worse.  They don't let you.  It's hard to be nice, though, honestly.  Because if somebody calls in and complains, you guys know, send me that.  Don't you just want to scream profanity at them?  Oh, absolutely.  And find out where they live and cave their head in with the phone?  And you know who the worst is? 
[02:31:00]  Wrestling fans.  Uh-oh, Sam.  Now they're bashing you.  I think it's so bad if you make fun of wrestling.  Wrestling fan.  I have to be a big Bob Backlund fan.  Calling you a little fucking wrestling faggot.  I'm glad Jim was there as a sport pop back.  Yes.  In 1982.  I haven't watched wrestling in probably 30 years.  He's calling you like a retarded child that plays with toys and watches wrestling like  a douchebag.  Real good.  He named himself either Free Beer or Hot Wings.  Oh, okay.  You know, that's where we're at.  And I didn't know back then what the deal was.  The sergeant slaughter walked by and I almost spit in his face. 
[02:31:30]  I literally, I'll never forget not spitting in his face.  And looking back, I wish I had.  Because he would have slapped me in the face and my father would have been embarrassed  because he probably would have slapped my father too.  And then the Norton men would have had to go home as two, you know, wrestling cuckolds  and just kind of held each other.  But it would have been a great story now to have.  It would be.  I don't know.  It works anyway.  Jim Norton joins us at Jim Norton on Twitter.  Something else that you do that I really respect is, and you do it a lot on Twitter,  is the way you sort of try to hold the news media responsible for their actions. 
[02:32:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  I have such a hate.  Thank you, man.  I have such a hatred for them.  It's like, you know, you look at the black-white reporting, the way they talk about racial  motivation, and it's not like I don't think black people are punished.  I think black people are treated very, very harshly in the justice system.  So this is not a white guy going, we're not treated fairly.  I mean, I'm not a naive dope.  My attacks are only on the press.  And they're white people.  It's a bunch of elitist, condescending, crap white people who have no black friends. 
[02:32:30]  They sit around with their other white friends, and they go like, oh my God, why?  Black people aren't treated very nicely, and they're just a bunch of fakes, and I have  a visceral hatred for them, so thank you.  Well, it really, it rings on Twitter and everywhere, so it's really impressive.  Did you hear Jesse Jackson and that stupid tweet, like, this poor Australian baseball player  is shot, and Jesse Jackson tweets, that type of violence is frowned upon.  Yeah, I know, you know, it's justice for this other guy, but for that guy, boy, that is 
[02:33:00]  not nice.  It's frowned upon, I know, ooh, easy, Reverend, with the harsh talk.  Oh, these boys, they need air conditioning, that's what they need, so they don't behave  this way.  Air conditioning.  It's just soft language when it comes to talking about what happened, which was, this  guy hated white people, and he said it on Twitter, I hate white people, and then he went  out and shot a white guy.  I said, okay, that happens, but just say that's what it is.  You know, it's like, for a long time, I pretended I didn't know they were transsexuals.  All right, I knew. 
[02:33:30]  Jim Norton joins us.  I saw a pundit yesterday talking about that same story, the one from Oklahoma where the  baseball player was shot, where he said that the reason that happened was because America  is on Facebook, and because there haven't been enough laws passed against third trimester  abortions.  Thus, the entire country has devalued life because of social media, secondlife.com, and abortion  laws.  There should be up to 18 years of old abortions.  I'll take care of the problem.  Black people have a legit point, too.  Like, black people will complain. 
[02:34:00]  Like, whenever it's a black guy that does it, it's like, ah, black culture stinks, but  when it's a white guy that does it, he's crazy.  He's a lone nut.  Like, and there is, I have to admit, a legit point to that, like, all white society is  not indicted when, like, you know, Holmes or Jared Lofner or one of these psychopaths  goes on a shooting spree.  We see them as lone animals, but when a black guy does it, we look at, like, oh, my God,  black culture is in trouble.  So, I guess, you know, we're all a little bit kind of twisted when it comes to race. 
[02:34:30]  That's true.  Jim Norton's new hour-long comedy special, Jim Norton, American Degenerate.  That's right.  That premieres some around night on Epyx TV.  How else can we get it?  The percentages don't add up, though.  That's probably going to be on more than one's eventually on DVD.  Yeah, well, it'll be on.  Epyx is like one of those.  I'm debating Jim on another show.  I know.  It's great.  X amount of cable providers.  They're not on every one.  So, go to epicshd.com, and you can get a free two-week trial.  You can watch my special whenever you want.  And if you don't like it, just cancel it.  But you can at least go there and watch it live. 
[02:35:00]  Deal-dot-com.  You don't have to wait for it to be out on Netflix or anywhere else.  Perfect.  Follow Jim on Twitter, at Jim Norton and JimNorton.com.  Continued success.  Thanks for joining us, Jim.  Continued success.  Hey, guys, thanks a lot, Matt.  You take good care of me.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  That's great.  I'm a huge fan.  Oh, yeah.  While you were discussing it, I followed him on Twitter just because I'd been meaning to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I like comedians like that.  Even if I don't necessarily agree with them, their opinions are still based just in common sense. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Where it's not caught up in the dumb rhetoric.  I mean, I share the same hatred that he does for the talking heads.  That's good.  On both sides.  I mean, they drive me.  I don't care if they're liberal or conservative.  They all do.  Those guys sound good, too, E-Rock.  Yeah.  We have no issue with them.  They sound good.  That didn't sound like anything that would be Jocktober-ish or anything.  Right.  Well, I guess a lot has changed in five years.  Oh.  Five years ago?  That's crazy.  What?  They're holding a grudge for something we said five years ago? 
[02:36:00]  What the fuck is that about?  Damn.  They're getting mad at them.  Yeah.  I like these guys.  Motherfuckers.  Fuck.  Why were they playing a music bed through the whole interview?  I didn't even notice.  That's, you know, you got to do that shit.  Maybe the PD is like, yeah, whenever you're on, you have a music bed.  The music never stops.  Right.  The music never stops.  It's a music bed.  That's how we got away with it.  Yeah.  We only stop the rock twice an hour.  And we go, but Bruce, we're talking like ten minutes at a time. 
[02:36:30]  Well, actually, the music bed under you.  There's a music bed under you, boys.  So technically.  The music hasn't stopped.  The music is still playing.  So why not play music under all the commercials and then you can say the music never stops.  Right.  Ever, ever.  Right.  Well, boys.  Boys.  That's why I make the big bucks.  Why don't you just go in there and babysit my cheese?  You like that story, Sam?  I love that story.  That's a true story, too.  It is fantastic. 
[02:37:00]  He enjoyed his time on our show last week or whenever it was.  Oh, good.  Yeah, he wrote me.  It's like, good catching up, boys.  Have you seen that commercial for the fucking Deal Dash?  I guess it is.  I don't know what it is.  There's, there's like these women and they're talking about, it's another one of these auction sites where you buy bids and there's this one woman and she's like, I won 150 auctions.  And all I'm thinking is, could you imagine the poor fuck that has to be married to that piece of shit? 
[02:37:30]  I don't believe that if you're qualified.  Oh, more Jim.  Yeah, this is, uh, what is this?  Todd and Tyler.  Todd and Tyler in the morning.  Hey, isn't that, uh, isn't that our intern's name?  I wish I had a gun.  Uh, I'm not, yeah, yes it is.  Yeah.  Hey.  Look at me.  He just said it before.  The new special is called American Degenerate.  Jim, thanks for joining the program.  Appreciate it, man.  Hi, guys.  Thanks.  I apologize for being a little bit late.  Stop apologizing.  I hate hearing myself.  I actually like this new special a lot.  And I'm not saying that just because I have to promote it. 
[02:38:00]  Like, I usually detest listening to myself.  And that clip was actually fairly painless.  So I appreciate you playing with it.  I don't hate it.  Well, we had, uh, our producer put that together.  And obviously I've seen a couple of your specials.  And there's a few swear words in there we couldn't play on the air.  But, uh, that was a nice, clean, uh, part.  And I agree with you.  What's up with his voice?  What's with the voice?  I also think people that really, really want guns shouldn't be allowed to have a leader.  I think it's one of those things that if you really, the guy I always knew growing  up that wanted a concealed handgun is a guy that shouldn't have one. 
[02:38:30]  And that'd be you.  Fuck you.  Well, it depends on the guy.  Like, cause I'm on, like, you know, I work with two very opposite dudes.  I'm on the Opie and Anthony show.  Familiar, yeah.  Oh, you know, okay.  Cause Opie's not a gun guy.  Yes, I am.  I'm obsessed with guns.  But he's a responsible gun owner.  The difference.  Like, he fills out all the paperwork.  Right.  And he does everything you're supposed to do.  I mean, you know, occasionally he'll, he'll drink a fifth of bourbon and then drive like  Pesci down the street firing out the window.  But aside from that, he's pretty good at handling guns. 
[02:39:00]  Like, he's a guy, he's a guy who probably should be allowed to have a gun because he handles  it well.  What a similar situation here.  Yeah, you're responsible.  Well, somewhat responsible gun owner.  I'm not into guns myself.  Oh, do you own one too, man?  You have one?  Do you have one, Todd?  Todd's got guns.  I got a couple of handguns.  I got a shotgun.  I got a .30-06.  They both got their skin going on with their gestures.  I got Anthony's words, and this is not a lie.  There was a .50 cal on his kitchen table.  Oh, no. 
[02:39:30]  If you come to my house, there will not be a .50 caliber handgun on the table.  That's who I deal with every morning.  Somebody has a .50 caliber weapon.  I got to hear what he thinks of us.  This rules.  Isn't that the thing that he's talking about now?  Like, when they're shooting at, you know, go home, GI, and he's fired into the woods  and he killed the sniper.  That's who I work with.  That's the gun that you use.  Sure, sure, sure.  I saw your last special, Please Be Offended, and I howled because, you know, I like really,  really hardcore stuff. 
[02:40:00]  And you are.  And you nail the hardcore stuff.  Now, even with ethics and those kind of specials, does the network come to you and say,  Ah, man, maybe one too many C-bombs.  No, ethics is really weird.  Like, they're the same as they do.  How many C-bombs?  Too many C-bombs.  Too many C-bombs.  They were great.  They were just wearing a C-bass.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Like, that's the only thing they care about.  Like, you can't go on and say something like, you know, hey, you know, it was a terrible effort.  You've got to be careful with that.  Oh, that's so much fun to do.  Yeah, let's hear it again.  Let's hear it again. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was a frustrating thing to do that and not have to deal with, like,  Shut up, Jimmy.  Let them talk.  They want to hear them say c-c-c-c-c.  They were amazing.  I don't know if you saw the opening to the special, but, you know, I'm kind of being sexually assaulted.  And at first they were like, well, is this okay?  And then they're like, all right, the fans loved it.  We're good with it.  That's all about it.  That's all about it.  If people are going to see Jim Norton, they want to see uncut Jim Norton.  Because you can't do a clean show.  It's Jim Norton.  You're still, uh, you're still, you're still, you're still, you're still.  Yeah, I know.  This is probably the one clip of my last three sessions you could play on. 
[02:41:00]  You are, you are, you're still, you're still.  You still got your own radio show?  I do an advice show on the Opie and Anthony.  Advice, you're still.  At 11 a.m. on 10 a.m. on Wednesday.  All right.  And I do something on the Boneyard on Sirius.  It's like a meditation.  I know, I know.  But, but, but, are you, are you listening to the Boneyard?  But mostly I'm with those guys.  And it's, you know, I don't know how many guys you have in your studio, but it's so much  easier for me.  They do all the heavy lifting and I just fire into the cyber lines.  That's right we do, Jimmy. 
[02:41:30]  Carrying their ass every fucking day.  That's our news guy.  Yeah, exactly.  It's our news guy.  News guy who tells franny stories.  He's actually carrying us today.  You're pretty warts at all about it.  We've had this conversation before.  Of course, sure, sure.  Conversation.  If you didn't have all that trouble, would you be an uninspired comic?  No, there's certain guys, like you look at guys like Leno or you look at Seinfeld or  guys that do Kleenex that aren't wrapped around their own personal. 
[02:42:00]  Yes, of course.  And they have great success.  I think it depends on what has always made you funny.  Like, look at Brian Regan.  Like, Regan is a clean comic.  Very funny.  Oh, you're pregnant.  But he's hilarious.  Like, he's goofy.  He doesn't talk about his horrendousness.  And yet, Jeff Dunham's another guy.  Yes.  We interviewed Jeff Dunham.  Jeff Dunham.  He's a guy.  He's got a ventriloquist.  Like, he's not a happy puppet guy in real life.  No, not at all.  This studio, he's not happy at all. 
[02:42:30]  No, not at all.  But that made me really respectful.  He's a miserable piece of shit.  And he was a clean act and he made fun of Islamic terrorism and he gets, you know, 100 million  hit.  But his personal life is probably going to end with a shotgun blast.  So I love that.  That's it.  I don't have the ability to separate those.  See, but I'm drawing more to the comics like you, so I don't know what that says.  Comics.  Well, you know, you look at George Carlin and he was a guy, like, prior to the guy who  talked about his own personal life.  Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. 
[02:43:00]  He's all a little weird and sexual experiences.  Comics.  Comics.  Oh, comics, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.  He didn't expose of his own a lot of personal stuff.  That's true.  No, he never did.  That's a great point.  I love Carlin, but he definitely wasn't that type of comedian at all.  Right.  I'm like my partner here.  I like to, we talk about a personal life a lot more just to get some comedy out of it.  And it helps a lot.  And we've had some issues.  I find it, too.  You know what it is, man?  Sure, sure, sure, sure.  So many people on a PC or radio, guys, it's like they think radio is easy.  It's like, man, we're doing 20 hours a week.  Yeah, we are.  We just have to let it all hang out. 
[02:43:30]  You can only talk about other people for so long.  And then there's a big lull.  And you're like, all right, all right, I had a homosexual experience when I was younger.  That's just a good point.  Check, check, check.  There's a long conversation.  Carry yourself under the bus.  I'll deal with you on that.  Dude, if it gets up to the next break,  I'll talk about anything.  Oh, I thought he was set fuck for a second.  It made me such a better comedian.  Because if you go on the air every day with schtick,  you don't feel good.  You have to say something that's really important.  Schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick. 
[02:44:00]  Jim Norton, American Degenerate,  the name of the new special on Epics.  We appreciate you calling Jim.  Oh, they're telling us you've got to go, Jim.  Are you touring?  I think you're stuck there every day.  Do you get a chance to go tour?  Yeah, all they are great with letting me go out and miss Friday shows  to go out and do my gigs.  Got it.  Start again, probably end of September.  Got it.  Yeah, we allow him.  That's hilarious how many times he gets our names in there.  It really is funny.  It's ballsy.  Big fans.  Hopefully meet you soon, sir.  Sure, meet you soon.  Schtick, schtick, schtick.  Hey, have a good one, Jimmy Norton. 
[02:44:30]  Schtick, schtick, schtick.  And like you said, not for the faint at heart.  American Degenerate.  I'm sorry, American Idiot.  That was a great album.  That was a Green Day album.  That's a really good album.  Schtick, schtick, schtick.  I knew I was going to say it eventually.  I kept saying American Degenerate.  I'm going to say Idiot.  And I did.  Yep.  All right.  All right.  Oh, it's getting late.  First you say it, then you are it.  Then I am it, right.  Then I am it.  I'm going to go on here with a funny bone tonight with a special, right?  Yep.  That was good.  That was good. 
[02:45:00]  Breathe in.  Breathe out.  Breathe in.  I heard that on the way in today.  Schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick.  Schtick, schtick, schtick.  All fucking day.  They were pretty good.  I will be doing that.  Schtick, schtick, schtick.  They were good, too.  Some good radio out there.  Damn it.  Yeah, right.  What the fuck?  Maybe that radio is turning around a little bit.  Maybe they got to, you know, step it up now with the way things are.  Yeah, I think that was pretty good shit right there.  They did all right, right?  Yeah, you got to give it to them.  That schtick thing was a little weird. 
[02:45:30]  That was Bush.  Schtick, schtick, schtick.  Schtick, schtick, schtick.  Schtick, schtick.  I could do that all day.  Machine head from Bush.  Oh, man.  Fucking guaranteed.  Five o'clock this afternoon.  I'll be out by the pool.  I'll have a cold bud with me and go, ah, schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick, schtick.  Like a fucking retard.  I love how we pick up on, like, the dumbest, stupidest, littlest thing.  As always. 
[02:46:00]  Scht, scht, scht, scht, schtick.  Don Wicklin, the jock sounds like Bill Murray in Caddyshack.  Yeah, sure.  The Dalai Lama.  The lamb himself.  The robes, the grace, bald.  Is that it?  Stricing.  That means we got to do radio if there's not another one.  Come on, man.  Sam, what's up?  I think there's broads here.  Oh, we got a broad.  We got a broad.  There is another one, but it's not until ten minutes from now.  Ten minutes?  Wow, this broad is pretty hot.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, man.  Let me see her.  Is it Cole Aniston?  Pussy.  Is she related to Jennifer?  Oh, man.  Look at the tits and pussy on her.  She's related to Jennifer Aniston.  No, how?  Yeah.  It's her cousin.  Yep.  Holy fuck.  Confirmed.  Fuck.  Whoa, look at this.  Them tits running the family, huh?  Them nice fucking tits.  She's not really her cousin.  No.  Look at her hairy pussy.  What the fuck?  What?  What?  Why would you do it?  Oh, man.  Look at her ass. 
[02:47:00]  I know, but then she's got to pull it aside.  Look at her legs.  Look at her hairy pussy.  Hey, someone sent me that.  Oh, she's got a little dirt back there.  A little dirt.  A little dirt.  Oh, shit comes out of there.  She might need a little bleaching back there.  It's crazy.  Maybe she's into having just a little dirt back there.  I got a video.  Someone sent me that video of that fucking wiener chick's porno.  Is it good?  No, she's terrible.  What was she doing?  There's a photographer, and he's telling her to do things. 
[02:47:30]  He goes, okay, now go down.  Give an orgasm face.  He goes, okay, now just make believe I'm not here.  Lay your head back.  Shut your eyes and just, you know, masturbate.  She's sitting there with her eyes closed, just slowly going in and out with her finger.  There's no sexuality to it.  No.  It's so dull.  And then at one point, she turns around, and she got that.  The ass is a little bit.  You're still with the fact that the ass is big.  Yeah.  It could be fun, though. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  She looks like one of those, like a throwdown, you know?  All right.  Yeah, she puts that face on.  She grabs a kid.  She's just, ah, ah.  Oh, there she is.  Whatever.  Who's this?  Oh, my God.  Ew.  What?  Is there all this shit?  It's like, like.  Oh, God.  Hey, Joe.  Smells like hot garbage.  Hot garbage and sizzling.  Hope Otto's doing well.  Yeah, I think he is.  That's right.  That's good to hear.  Very good to hear.  Whoa.  Oh, man. 
[02:48:30]  You see this one?  Wait.  Nice, right?  No, I was looking back at the girl that's here.  Shush, shush.  And, oh, close the curtains.  Oh, gee.  Wow, what up.  Jimmy would like this girl, because she's got a fat pussy right here.  Which one?  Look.  Oh, yeah.  See?  She's putting her finger in.  Let's do stuff to it.  Oh, man.  Whoa.  What the fuck is this about?  It's a box licking in this penthouse.  I'm back in fucking Saigon with this spread.  Oh, wait.  She's from Tokyo. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, fucking David Tell's in this one.  Look at this.  Talking dirty.  David Tell.  Nice.  That's why we should be promoting penthouse.  There we go.  Big fucking David Tell article in the latest penthouse.  Sweet.  Fucking A.  Way to go, Dave.  This chick looks like a girl next door kind of a girl right there.  That's the one I say.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not bad.  Not bad at all.  Whoa.  Look at that vulva.  I like using technical terms.  They love showing a lot of that pink.  She has a nice labia majora. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, what is this thing?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Is that poo coming out?  Or is that...  What is that?  Is that part of her lady parts?  Is that the little hangy thing?  But it looks like...  Why would they put that picture in?  Yeah, yeah.  Snip that.  I'm going to fuck...  Can you tweet this?  It looks like a little...  If you put not safe...  It looks like a little Opie and Anthony nugget's coming out.  Ah, the nugget.  But it's one of her...  What part of it?  It could be a labia minora.  I'm not sure for real because her hand's in the way, 
[02:50:00]  which makes it look more like she might be squeezing out some duty.  Well, you know, some girl's got them things.  They hang a bit.  I don't know what's going on.  Looks like when you leave the steak on the fire a little too long.  I hear you, man.  I hear you.  All right, we should take a break.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my.  Whoa, an article on weed.  Oh, well, what do we hear?  Oh, hi.  Who is this now?  Who's your friend? 
[02:50:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Women do this when they're with each other?  They do.  Wow.  All the time.  That's what I hear.  Oh.  Ooh, phone sex.  Blonde ambition.  That hasn't been used.  Call me, you fucking loser.  That's how they're promoting their sex life.  It just says, call me, you fucking loser.  Oh, I love the ads in the back.  I haven't seen them in a long time.  Oh, man.  Yeah, call me, you fucking loser.  That's nice.  Here for 89 cents, you could talk with dripping wet cunts. 
[02:51:00]  Really?  Yeah.  89 cents.  If they're not dripping, do you get your money back?  I hope so.  Satisfaction guaranteed?  Yeah.  Wow.  I've never seen no.  School girl pussy.  Oh.  That's good.  Uh-huh.  I'm holding for you.  Get it?  Like on the phone?  Yes, I got that.  But if you call, you'll talk to her.  I like that.  Call me, you fucking loser.  That's how they're promoting their number. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, okay.  I guess I better call.  This one is mine, obviously.  Hi, is this mine?  I'm a loser.  My lips, your cock.  No, where's that?  It's right there, second page.  She's pulling her little panties down.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Hot blondes, brunettes, redheads, European, Asian, and local sluts.  Bisexuals and she-males.  Housewives and college sluts.  Really?  $29.99 flat rate per call. 
[02:52:00]  That's a lot of money.  For fucking what?  What are you going to get?  Some fat piece of shit.  And you're not seeing these girls.  Calling from another room while her kids cry.  Boy, the internet has really done something because there's one page of these ads.  This used to be the entire fucking magazine.  Was just these fucking ads.  Oh, look, we got a bedtime story.  The long ride home.  Well.  What do you think happened here?  Buckle up.  In the confines of a vintage Mustang. 
[02:52:30]  Two soldiers just back from Afghanistan.  Head for home.  Along the way, they managed to bring new meanings to the phrase park and ride.  Oh.  Oh.  Well.  Well, what do we got here?  Oh.  I leaned over his lap and turned my attention to his thickening cock.  Oh.  And fingered the curve of the satin soft cap.  Soft cap.  He slid me down, his fingers biting into my hips.  As his cock crowded through swollen tissue, I bit my bottom lip as I savored the stretch.  Why are they doing the girl's point of view? 
[02:53:00]  It should be the guy talking about the girl.  Oh, what do we got here?  Well.  The, uh, we used to go into the job trailer, you know, on the, um, fucking job site.  They got the trailer there that the architect goes into.  And they have all the plans and the supervisor, general contractor.  And, uh, they had the, the job site phone.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, we used to dial up these chicks.  Really?  From the magazines.  Let's talk.  Oh, they must have been so pissed because it cost so much money.  So why don't we dial up?  We used to do this.  Where's our big fat phone?  I don't know.  We should call up because I want to see what happens. 
[02:53:30]  I want to call up.  If you don't call me, you fucking loser.  I want to call, call me, you fucking loser.  Yeah.  Uh, one-on-one phone sex, two bucks a minute.  Right.  Discreet billing.  Pay by credit.  Wait.  Pay by?  Pay by credit, debit, prepaid, or gift card, or check.  Can I write you a check?  You write it.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  You take a check?  Yes, we take checks. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Where do I send that?  Can I just give you my account number?  Oh, that's good.  You know, jot it down because this has to be reputable.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, check.  You have to wait for it to clear.  Right?  Yeah, you wait for it.  There's a...  Yeah, I'm sitting here and I got my dick in my hand.  Did that check clear yet?  Is that cleared?  Did I endorse the back?  If I didn't endorse that, it's going to take even longer. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, this is a product and it says,  Increase Ejaculate Volume.  That's what you want.  Hey, ladies, you want a bigger load?  Guess what the name of the product is called.  Kumquat.

Order now.  Oh!  Rope.  What are we doing?  We got to get our guest or...  She's waiting.  Yeah, she's waiting.  Whatever.  Make her wait.  She can wait.  It looks very nice on the...  What?  What's wrong?  The cover.  The fuck's rude?  Very nice.  What are you talking about? 
[02:55:30]  Very rude the way you said that.  I know the fucking doctor's office have to wait so somebody can wait around here for  once.  That doesn't make any sense.  Is she the pet of the year?  Yes.  She is pet of the year.  Pet of the year.  Wow, man.  I'm going to get her picture right up here.  All right, the grading's going to be a little tough today then if she's pet of the year.  I'll tell you right now.  Oh, man.  All right?  That would not be nice.  I mean, you can actually see her in person.  You don't have to look at photos of naked women.  Well, I like having the naked picture up here so I could look at her in real life and  then look. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Compared to Travis.  See if she gained an ounce or two.  Yeah.  Wow, she really...  Those are implants, I would think.  What page?  I lost my page.  The question you could ask her.  She's got a nice, what they call pussy on her.  What page, Ant?  I lost my page.  It's page 43.  43 in my workbook.  Yeah.  Turn to page 43 in your workbook.  Or 44.  All right.  The boobs are fantastic.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  She's got a great ass, too.  Her hair and her eyes are beautiful.  A little dirt around the asshole.  Maybe you try to see all those things in person.  Um, nice red butter stick.  She's got a nice, um, yeah.  She's got a nice technique as far as, like, spreading.  I like the way she's squatting.  If you turn to page 46.  Sure, okay.  The way where she's squatting.  Right.  Uh, lovely pink, uh, pussy lips that are separated.  Very nice, even.  Right.  Um.  Oh, she's just down the hall. 
[02:57:00]  What?  What happened?  Oh, she is?  All right.  Relax.  Oh, look at here.  You usually have to wait at the doctor's office.  A long fucking time sometimes.  Like, over a half hour?  Oh, God, yeah.  A lot of candy crush time.  Well, fair is fair, then.  She's been here, uh, she's 34 minutes now.  She's been waiting.  Oh, shit.  All right.  We're going to take a break and talk to Nicole and Aniston.  Yeah.  I think she's related to Jennifer Aniston.  She is.  They're cousins.  They are.  They are.  All right, cool.  I don't believe it.  I believe it.  I don't believe it. 
[02:57:30]  If we're all insane, it's got to be true.  He was right about the Apollo Metallica thing.  He sure was.  I gotta go, I gotta go brush my teeth.  All right.  All right.  I haven't brushed them in a few days, so I figured today would be a good day to do that.  I'm going to read some things.  Some bass breath.  Uh-huh.  Do I have something to read, or is this old?  No, that's yours.  Oh, thanks.  You got more after that?  No, he doesn't.  Oh.  God damn it.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  What's serious next time? 
[02:58:00]  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  Metallica Day.  Let's welcome Nicole.  Yeah, let's bring her in.  Aniston, to the show.  Yes.  Her and Laney, coming through the door.  All right.  We are talking to the Pet of the Year.  Penthouse Pet of the Year. 
[02:58:30]  Penthouse Pet of the Year.  That's quite the distinction.  Bro, what's going on out there?  Well, they're coming in.  What?  Hi.  Hi, Nicole.  Hi, Nicole.  Beautiful, Nicole.  Take a seat right there.  Hi, Laney.  How are you?  Hi, Laney.  How are you?  Good, thank you.  Good, man.  Great.  Oh, look.  She is beautiful.  You are deserving of Pet of the Year.  I'll tell you that much.  Her finger up her nose.  What happened?  She was picking her nose.  Were you just picking your nose?  That's a pretty girl. 
[02:59:00]  Pretty girls can get away with that.  Were you really picking your nose?  I was, yeah.  It's weird.  If you just saw some girl picking her nose, you'd just be like, oh, a girl's picking her nose.  But, like, pretty girl picking her nose is like, aw, that's adorable.  She's picking her nose.  Well, if it's a creepy, like, big fat guy or something.  I was like, oh, oh.  Well, yeah.  Pretty girls could get away with a lot of stuff, though.  Yeah, you don't need it.  Like, picking the nose.  You don't need it, though, right?  I don't eat it?  You don't eat your...  I don't?  Oh, you do?  You pick and eat?  Just kidding.  I don't have the nails for that anymore.  No.  Why?  Why did you get rid of your nails?  I couldn't stop eating it. 
[02:59:30]  Jesus.  I might as well just carry it.  You don't really have nails?  Why?  No.  You know what?  It ends up shredding your nail beds, anyway.  And then you start losing sensitivity, and then you start poking people's eyes out without  knowing it.  It's a liability.  Hey, I see that.  That's terrible.  In your spread, you've got short nails.  Yeah.  I like that.  But they're well-groomed.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Wow.  Yeah, you're a...  What do you call it?  A spread?  Hey, you see your spread in penthouse. 
[03:00:00]  That's kind of an odd thing to say.  Photo of...  Pictorial.  Yes.  You're pictorial.  Wow.  If I may say, hubba hubba.  In the vernacular of the 30s.  We don't know how to talk to girls.  No, that's why we're here and doing radio.  We get really shy.  Always here.  Yeah.  We get shy in front of girls.  Yeah.  Right, Laney?  Yes.  We clam up.  I used to be a guy.  I understand.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  She's got a sense of humor. 
[03:00:30]  Jimmy's not here.  Yeah, Jimmy would love you.  I'm Jimmy.  What, um...  You have a boyfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah?  How long?  Wow.  A couple months.  I mean, it's dick.  Is it?  What?  I'm teasing, of course.  How long?  Did you see how she said yeah, though?  Eh.  You know what?  Nothing is forever until I get a ring in my finger.  Oh.  Are you looking?  You're looking to get married?  No.  Good.  No.  I got too much to do.  I got too many places to go.  You're a busy girl now.  You're pet of the year. 
[03:01:00]  Where does one go after pet of the year?  That seems to be the pinnacle.  Straight to hell.  No.  That seems to be the pinnacle.  Where do you go from there?  In the adult world, yeah.  That's kind of...  I've kind of mastered my domain, so now I'm just going to kind of hang out and do a little  radio show and...  You're doing radio?  I'm doing a little radio.  I really like radio.  I've had a hell of a time with it.  And I like mainstream print work and mainstream acting.  Wait, wait.  Where are you doing radio?  Where am I doing radio?  Right here.  Oh, I thought you meant you had your own radio show.  No.  That'd be cool.  That'd be cool. 
[03:01:30]  Why not?  That would be cool, yeah.  You should.  I want to say penthouse is working on it.  Oh, okay.  So that'd be kind of cool, but nothing solid so far.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  So what about this relationship?  What is it?  Long distance?  Where's Vick?  It's long distance.  It's a state-to-state.  Oh, boy.  Situational.  Those work well.  Sure does.  You know what?  I'm a very independent woman.  I don't want anybody in my house all the time.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, okay.  So it's like it's not a live-in.  It's not a live-in situation or anything.  Good for you.  She is so not into it. 
[03:02:00]  Good for you.  I just want to be alone all the time.  She's being honest.  I love it.  Where do you call home?  Temecula?  Southern California.  Yeah.  Where is that at?  You know?  Yeah, it's Temecula.  Almost like a mini Napa.  You know.  Temecula.  Southern California.  Sounds better when you say it.  Orange County.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Where is that as far as L.A. goes?  It's like what?  In between San Diego and L.A.  It's 85 miles south of downtown.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's where Bob wanted the receipt for the 25-cent toll when we were in San Diego. 
[03:02:30]  We got a really cheap agent.  Yeah.  And he collects receipts when you drive around with them.  What a whinny.  And it was, I think it was 25 cents.  I'm serious.  It's probably gone up since then, but he asked for a receipt on 25 cents.  I was mortified.  I know, right?  It is embarrassing.  Yes.  He gets receipts for everything, but that doesn't matter.  I used to live in San Juan Capistrano, where the swallows come back.  And Laguna Beach.  Sam and the Capistrano.  Laguna Beach.  Dana Point.  I lived in Dana Point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know. 
[03:03:00]  It's a little...  I was a kid.  It's not like now.  You know.  Yeah.  You're out there.  Probably partying it up every night.  What does a girl like you do for fun?  I'm tired.  Are you?  I'm tired for that.  Yeah.  Do you?  Are you one of those just getting your jammies, sit on the couch and watch some TV?  Sweats and jammies, and unfortunately, this is my day job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nudity is second choice to jammies.  Really?  Yeah?  Yeah.  What about sleep?  You sleep nude, or do you put a little jammies on?  I'm a jammies.  I'm a jammies sleeper, but absolutely no underwear when you're sleeping. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  And no socks, either.  No.  Socks.  I don't understand people that sleep.  No, they don't keep warm.  I'm a socks guy.  Socks make my feet colder than if I don't have socks on.  My feet get cold.  You can rub them together.  You go.  And you can't have blanket over the feet when you're sleeping, either.  No, everyone knows you put one leg out.  There's temperature regulation.  One leg out.  I like nothing tucked in, because I like to take my sheets and blankets and switch them  and swirl them.  Yeah.  Bed yoga.  Yes.  Exactly.  Bed yoga.  And you could regulate your temperature by hanging a leg out a little bit. 
[03:04:00]  You know, you'll whip it over.  Now you've got more real estate uncovered.  But the pajamas?  I don't know.  I don't know.  And they're not even sexy at all.  No?  So any kind of scenario you want to think of.  If I were you, I'd be rolling around that bed with my big fucking tits.  Just fucking.  I'd be fingering myself.  This is great.  I'm beautiful.  Look how high I am.  I'm fucking beautiful.  This is what everyone wants to do.  You do.  And I look down and I'm like, oh, it's a great fucking day. 
[03:04:30]  Right?  Look at this.  Nice.  Jesus.  Yeah, because if I didn't have tits and I looked down, it would be kind of shitty.  We've got a lot in common.  We like to touch your pussy.  Yeah.  I'm just saying.  Nothing?  No.  Well, that's fucking, all right.  That's pretty hot then.  Yeah.  Sleepy.  But, you know, you're a regular girl, you seem.  So it's not like, you know, you think there's this glamorous kind of silk-sheeted thing.  You're drooling.  You've got some wacky pajamas on and you're just watching TV. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  And I got like a bowl of fucking beef jerky.  Beef jerky.  Eating my weight and beef jerky.  I love beef jerky.  Beef jerky's the greatest.  It's the best thing ever.  But she's not selling magazines, lady.  No, no, no.  No, no.  But you know what?  I'm basically saying I got bad breath.  That's how much I like it.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going all out.  Can you make it as well as they fucking make it?  When you just get it at the deli or something and just grab...  It's got to be the roadside stand in the middle of nowhere on the way to Vegas.  Yeah?  On the way to Vegas, you hit one of those roadside stands. 
[03:05:30]  Okay.  Yeah?  You like Vegas, do you?  And it's almost like Alien or butthole beef jerky or something.  Ant loves Vegas, too.  Yeah, I like Vegas, too.  Do you gamble?  I just got back.  I just learned to play poker and blackjack about two weeks ago.  Oh, man.  Beginner's luck.  And I played a tournament in Sturgis and it was the shit.  It was so much fun.  Isn't that great?  Why did you go to Sturgis for the bike thing?  The bike rally, yeah.  Oh, wow.  They must have loved you up there.  It was really cool.  You were a hit, I'm sure.  It was really cool.  Did you have a title up there?  The Hangout Queen?  I don't know.  The Hangout Queen.  We're talking to the Hangout Queen right now.  With those fucking biker broads up there, they must have been like, wow, her tits is 
[03:06:00]  above her belly button.  It was so...  That's amazing.  50, there were men and women, tons of wives out there, but none of them with any kind  of high tit situation.  No, that's so weird.  They got the hangers?  I think that motorcycle vibrating turns your tits completely flat.  Breaking down the tissue.  And droopy.  Majority were like pancakes with like nails.  Yes!  Wow.  Then it's those fried egg ones.  It was hot, right?  That's terrible.  Hanging on for a while.  Sexy, right? 
[03:06:30]  Hot, I like that.  Yeah, with fucking property of crowbar tattooed on the fucking nipple.  Did you have like...  A lot of barbed wire armbands.  Yes!  And tramp stamps, too.  Any tats on you?  I have two.  I have...  What do you got?  An anchor on my wrist.  And I got a little...  Something on the back of your neck?  That's kind of good, though, because in your line of work, it's kind of good that you  didn't get a bunch of shit there.  No, and you know what?  You tatted up.  A lot of girls just go all out.  Crazy now, yeah.  And there's a niche market for that, but not everybody fits that category.  Exactly.  And if you... 
[03:07:00]  You know, if they want someone with a lot of tats, you get some Sharpies on you.  You draw it in and wash it off.  You can get a mannequin and draw on a mannequin, and the mannequin will do anything you want.  There you go.  Any size you want, you can...  That's good.  What's the significance of the anchor?  Were you a Navy girl?  What was that?  What branch of the service?  What branch?  What are we talking about here?  Don't let the language...  Carry a vessel?  Destroyer?  What'd you serve on?  Right, right.  Ideal and semen.  Whoa.  Nice.  Nice.  No, it's like a...  It keeps you grounded kind of thing. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, okay.  It's a thing for my mom and I.  It's kind of symbolic, like...  Is your mom cool with the nudity?  You know what?  Yeah, she's good.  She kind of laughed at the cover of that penthouse, though.  Why?  Really?  Because the face is...  They cut off half my face and pasted the other half on it.  All right.  See, she...  Thank you.  Thank you.  We had a situation once.  Yes.  They made my neck twice as long.  We had a situation.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  And they gave Anthony a baby arm.  They gave me a baby arm.  Can you show the picture?  Where is that picture, Sam?  I have to see.  Oh, it's so terrible. 
[03:08:00]  No, we obsessed about my long neck and then it turned...  See?  They put, like, Ronald Reagan makeup on me.  Did they bring your hairline down, too?  Yes.  Yes, they did.  We figured out there's at least 20 things wrong with that picture.  They also made...  They took an eyebrow from another shot.  And put it in there.  Because they liked when he raised his eyebrow.  It's like Frankenstein.  Yeah, what?  That doesn't even look anything like that.  I know.  It's terrible.  And it doesn't even look anything like that.  Thank you.  And they made his neck too long.  They made him smile.  He looks like some nerdy tech geek in, like, junior college. 
[03:08:30]  Right?  And the guy showed us this new program and he goes, look what I'm going to do.  And I swear to you, I said, don't touch the photos.  And he still did it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now we understand.  So what happened?  They took...  They cut off half my face and pasted the half to make it symmetrical.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's the same shot, just reversed.  It's not even my face.  It's not my lips.  It's not my nose.  It's nothing.  They say that you can't take the right side of your face, reverse it, and put it on the  left.  Yeah, look.  Because her eyebrows, you can see there's like... 
[03:09:00]  The lashes.  Holy shit, this is only half your face.  Yeah.  Can you believe that?  They mirrored it.  Can you believe that?  Why would they do that?  Because...  What's wrong with half your...  I told her, like, get a fucking mannequin if that's what you wanted.  Wait, turn to me.  Well, what's wrong with your face that they would do that?  Well, clearly I'm not the right woman for it.  Because that's not me on the magazine cover.  If they would have taken the other side and mirrored it, Frankenstein would have been  terrible.  Why would they just take a picture of her?  Lainey, what happened?  Lainey, explain.  Why do they do this shit?  I don't get this.  They're crazy.  They are crazy. 
[03:09:30]  I also have no freckles, no pores, no stretch marks.  There's nothing there.  There's nothing.  You know what it looks like?  One of those promo shots for the toddlers in Tiaras?  Yeah, it does.  Where they just move everything out.  I'm airbrushed to dance.  Can I tell you something for real?  Yeah.  The picture isn't that bad, so let's relax there.  You're way hotter in person in this shot.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That photo set was phenomenal.  And I love the photographers that did it.  And I was so stoked to see them and all their creativity. 
[03:10:00]  And then they just photoshopped it.  Now, did they also mirror your labia here?  Because I'm seeing that I'm seeing.  Let me see.  Let me see.  I'm teasing, of course.  Right there.  Nope.  That is all me.  That is you.  And you like your little hair down there, I see.  I do.  Let's make it a comeback.  I'm a grown woman.  God!  I'm not a child.  I think that once you hit puberty, you grow hair down there to signify, I am a woman.  I have hair down there.  I just like it because it harkens back to a simpler time.  Yeah.  You know, when you were a guy, when you were a guy, no, when I was a guy growing up, 
[03:10:30]  that's how you knew you were hitting what I call pay dirt.  When you'd shove your hand down the front of the panties and you'd go.  And back then, you didn't realize how far down you had to go.  You don't know.  You're like reaching like, whoa, holy shit.  I'm like four inches below the belly button.  I'm still on skin.  There was a time I thought it was two inches tops below the belly button.  I swear.  I thought it was right at the buckle of the belt.  Because these girls, they would keep their pants up so high.  Right.  Well, then they arch their back and it's like further back. 
[03:11:00]  Exactly.  Like, what the hell are you doing?  And then it looks lonely.  Sometimes that patch looks lonely, though.  Yeah.  Yes.  Sometimes it looks lonely.  You got to get it to tie in.  Yes.  You got to get it to tie in.  You can't have it too high.  You get your hand down there and you were like, oh, there it is.  Yeah.  Get a little hair.  And it just looks cool.  We used to call it patch.  It does look cool, right?  We used to call it touching patch.  Touching patch?  Yeah, it was a big deal.  Did they call it?  I was in junior high school.  Well, not even.  I can't even say I was in junior high school.  I was in high school.  Stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. 
[03:11:30]  Putt.  Putt.  Putt.  Putt.  Putt.  Oh, man.  I was still calling into a man.  Yeah.  You sure you weren't touching your own patch?  No.  This is great.  Is that what you called it when you asked me?  Huh?  Hey, guys.  At home last night, I was touching patch.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, this is the January 2013 issue.  It's outdated now.  This is the beginning.  Well, but you're the pet of the year all year, obviously.  Yeah.  So you've been doing this for the whole year so far?  Yeah.  So far, so good.  What are some of the duties of the penthouse pet of the year? 
[03:12:00]  Drinking beer, telling loud nasty jokes, risen on war veterans graves.  Holy shit.  I'm the penthouse pet of the year, then.  Good job.  Congratulations.  That's amazing.  That's exactly what I do.  It's appearances and PR and representing the company that I love and care for so much.  And I'm giving hell to the editing department.  What a great gig, man.  Are you going to move on to other things, like acting?  Yeah.  I'd love to jump into a little acting. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  I got a knack for it.  Yeah.  Got the look.  Yeah.  Well, they got to look at me.  Well, you got the look.  That's good.  I think you got that look.  Yeah?  Yeah, you look like Hollywood.  You could do that.  Thanks.  You start off.  My surgery ended up pretty good.  Yeah.  I can't even see my atoms.  I'm holding.  Yeah.  You know what you need to do, though?  Cut off half your face and then just peel the other side off and paste it on the other  side.  And my plastic surgeon said, you know, Nicole, we just can't do that for you.  Yeah, they should be able to do that.  You can do it to your vagina, but you can't do it to your face.  I would love to talk to the guy that decided, well, here's what we're going to do. 
[03:13:00]  It's probably the guy that used to work at XM.  He probably moved on to the penthouse.  Unless you sneezed during this picture, they loved every bit of it, but half your face  was going like...  Yeah, seriously.  Was I having a stroke?  Yes, maybe you had a stroke.  Then they photoshopped your nose.  They did.  My nose is not my nose.  My lips are not my lips.  No, it doesn't look anything like you.  You're a natural beauty.  My mother looked at that and she said, what the hell is this?  Who is that?  Right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Well, was that the only mom thing she had a problem with?  That was the only thing she had a problem with, ironically enough.  And she looked at every picture and...  Oh, yeah.  She's like, oh, this is beautiful.  Oh, my God.  It looks like mine.  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't realize yours looked like mine.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Pete.  What?  I've got a couple kids and they go, oh, she's got your eyes.  So, I would imagine the mom would go, oh, my God.  You got my labia.  Oh, you got mom's labia. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, my God.  And that's...  Sorry.  That's great.  You really have a wonderful body on you there.  Thank you.  Missy.  That was a couple pounds ago, too.  I've been...  Was it?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  What are you, dieting?  You're getting gain or lose?  No, no.  I'm not dieting.  Okay.  Because you look very thin.  You look good.  And running.  Okay.  My ass.  You do look thin.  Man, I like that, though.  That's fucking...  I'm just going to paw through the magazine now while you're sitting here.  One-handed. 
[03:14:30]  Look at you.  One-handed.  There you go.  Jacking it.  My work here is done.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I got to get a tooth fixed.  That's good, though.  What?  Do you got to get a tooth fixed?  I got to go.  You fucking dentist.  Come on.  That's why I brush my teeth.  Got a beautiful girl.  See, I brush my teeth.  You brush your teeth so you can go to the dentist and have to clean your teeth?  Because I forgot to brush them this morning.  Are you going to brush them right now?  I brushed them already.  You're just holding on to the supplies for brushing?  Yeah.  I realize before you go...  I'm going to have to brush them again.  Before you go to the dentist, you always brush your teeth, and it's the same thing as 
[03:15:00]  the way sports teams play when the game is close and it's the last, like, minute of  the game.  Like, you brush your teeth the same way.  Yeah.  It's like with this energy and power.  And if you did that every time you brush your teeth, your teeth would be amazing.  But you only do it before you go to the dentist, because you've got to be like, well, this  guy's going to really be poking around in there.  Right.  Right.  I'm poking around for a compliment, because I want him to say, huh?  You're taking care of your teeth, I say.  Yep.  Yes, I am.  And everyone lies about flossing. 
[03:15:30]  I floss.  You know what?  I am a sick fucking floss.  Your teeth are stunning.  They're stunning.  Thank you.  I could bite a dick right off.  Wow.  Okay, then.  That's nice.  Look at the time.  No, it's great.  She seems a bit angry.  Your teeth, are those all yours?  They are.  You know what I did?  The Invisalign?  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  I had a little overlap.  Did you?  A little booby trap going on.  Like they were misaligned or something?  Just a tick.  Yeah.  And I got the...  Did you ever have braces?  I did.  Invisalign.  I mean, when you were a kid?  Did you ever have the big silver ones? 
[03:16:00]  No.  No, we had mac and cheese instead of braces when I was a kid.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's adorable.  I still love mac and cheese.  Mac and cheese and green beans.  Really?  And ground beef.  That was our home cooking on a paper plate.  Just slop it out there on a paper plate and go to town.  I think it's just straight up nostalgia, but I still fucking eat it.  That's great.  Brings it back to a simpler time.  Again, a simpler time.  For me, it was margarine and butter sandwiches. 
[03:16:30]  What?  Margarine and sugar sandwiches.  And sugar, right.  Did you ever do the Nestle quick on the toast?  Nestle quick?  Oh, my God, no.  That's like the chocolate stuff.  We weren't rich enough to have Nestle's quick.  The powder?  Yeah, I got a friend of mine who used Nestle's quick on toast with butter.  With butter?  That sounds really good.  That doesn't sound bad.  Yeah.  I'm going to try that.  I bet it's like a Nutella thing.  Wannabe.  Like a wannabe Nutella.  Yeah.  Not-tella.  Say yes.  They thought it was a great idea to spread the margarine and then dump sugar on it.  They were poor.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:17:00]  We were a bit poor.  He was poor, so they had to eat those things.  Yeah.  I had to, meanwhile, I'm sitting there in the lap of luxury eating chocodiles.  And tang.  Yeah, chocodiles, a little tang.  We're now filthy rich, though.  Ovaltine.  We're filthy rich now.  Good job.  Oh, yeah, crazy.  Crazy rich.  Money turned you on?  Now you got the real Nutella, huh?  Right.  That's right.  I'm busting a Nutella all over.  Obviously, we don't dress the part, but don't let our clothes fool you.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Lumberjack and Lusterjack.  At least I'm not fucking U.S. Army.  This is the only shirt I could find in the middle of the night when I left this morning.  You can't imagine what it's like waking up in the morning that early and running around,  looking at the clock, and trying to find your clothes.  It's just so...  Wear when you're not being seen.  It's tough.  Yeah, because you don't really give a shit.  Like, I don't look at Opie and start judging what he's wearing in the morning.  Who cares?  And who else are you going to tell, anyway?  Yeah, but then, you know, then you come in, and we're like, oh, man. 
[03:18:00]  I didn't realize the beautiful girl was coming in today.  I would have dressed better.  Fucking like a slump.  We would have dressed better for you.  I actually have that exact outfit on underneath this.  Oh, good.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  That's good.  Thank you.  I'd love to see it.  And I got...  No.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Well, I got to go get a toothpick.  Yeah, yeah.  We ran much too late today with our other guest.  Oh, we got to say goodbye to our intern real fast, too.  Oh, where is he?  Yeah, you want to hang out for this? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Our intern, you know these internships that go on?  Him, she, it.  We had two girls, Jackie and Sydney, and they were beautiful and awesome.  Perfect interns.  And every day was a treat to have them in here.  Oh.  And then...  Magical.  This.  This.  We get a guy who's just like every other dude that's interned for the show.  He has better hair than me, and I'm...  Oh, God.  Well, it isn't quite as greasy today as it usually is.  Oh, wow.  He must have taken his...  What is that?  ...once every two weeks shower.  That's his goodbye cake.  I got a cake. 
[03:19:00]  You guys.  It's a chocolate chip muffin.  What's that?  With a pretzel on it?  You guys really shouldn't have.  With a pretzel rod.  Is that pretzel going to be lit on fire?  Because otherwise, it's just not...  Don't like the pretzel.  Did someone eat half of it, too?  Is that what I'm saying?  Someone's been gnawing on the outlet.  Oh, it's...  Roland already ate...  I don't mind.  I'm sure it's been wrong before.  For you to enjoy.  I just want to acknowledge his internship.  Oh, yeah.  You gave him a half-eaten muffin with a pretzel rod shoved into it.  Well...  I don't even understand why the pretzel rod's there. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  Godspeed.  Thank you.  We should light it on fire.  Yes.  What, the intern?  Yeah.  Sure.  You're right.  We should.  The other intern's got like a party.  What are you talking about?  The girl interns, you spent like half an hour with them.  You bought them cakes.  Yeah.  One of them had like a rock star in there singing.  Is someone going to come sing to me?  Is that...  No.  What are you singing to the interns?  Is there an intern song?  No.  No.  There was...  We should make one up.  No, that's...  Yeah, Ryan Starr came in and sang to one of the interns. 
[03:20:00]  Serenaded her.  Kind of a goodbye song.  Jackie's hot mom.  Little Jackie.  Balloons.  Both doable.  There were balloons.  There was cake.  There was a real emotion.  They brightened up the place.  The pretzel rods are free.  We got them in the kitchen.  Oh, well, there you go.  We have a kitchen?  Company guy.  Yeah, the girls were amazing to have around here.  Just every morning I'd walk in, I'd pass the little playroom, and just be like, hi.  And they'd be like, good morning.  It was so nice.  Like kindergarten? 
[03:20:30]  Like playroom?  Pretty much.  You know what?  Yeah, it was like a little summer camp that the girls had.  And it was just fantastic.  They brightened up the day.  When they came in to bring in water or food or something like that, it was like, oh, Jackie,  thank you.  Hey, Sydney.  The girls left a week ago.  This is his last day.  All right.  Well, he's got a muffin and a pretzel.  Congratulations on your job well done.  Thank you.  You're the only one that would call it that.  A dail muffin with a nasty pretzel. 
[03:21:00]  A nasty pretzel rod in it.  That I found on the floor in the bathroom.  In the men's bathroom.  With the pre-chewed muffin.  All right.  Nicole, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Of course, the Penthouse Pet of the Year.  Can people see you somewhere?  You're going to be somewhere, right?  I'm going to be at headquarters tonight.  Headquarters.  9.30?  Headquarters at 9.30 tonight.  And what are you going to be doing?  Drinking beer.  Drinking some beer.  Drinking some beer.  Hanging out.  Hanging out.  Taking some pictures.  Signing some stuff.  Taking some pictures.  Do you dance a little bit over there?  I'm actually not dancing because it's really embarrassing. 
[03:21:30]  Do the Elaine from Seinfeld?  It is exactly what I'm doing.  But the fingers are spread.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Oh, you're like a little kitten.  A little angry kitten.  Yeah.  Fingers spread apart.  Sometimes they go.  Aw.  Sway.  It's adorable.  Nice.  Got to give it to you.  Thank you.  What?  Sam?  You didn't even mention his name.  Oh.  I don't know his name.  We don't even really know it.  I remember Jackie and Sidney.  I think it's Tyler. 
[03:22:00]  You got it.  Okay.  That's all I needed.  These last three months, we're all for that moment.  But the thing is, I just know it because I didn't know it so much.  Right.  I mean, people just kept telling me.  Next week, you won't know it?  No.  That's all right.  No, there'll be an instance in the future where it'll be like, oh, yeah, the intern, Tyler.  And I'll be like, ah.  And that's like, oh, yeah, the intern, Jackie.  Oh, wow, Jackie.  Of course, Jackie.  Jackie.  Yes.  Let's call her.  Yeah, we should.  All right.  We got to go.  Is there a website or anything, Nicole? 
[03:22:30]  Twitter?  What do you got?  Yeah.  Oh, you got Twitter?  Twitter is xnicoleannistonx.  And pretty soon, nicoleanniston.com will be up.  Very cool.  And you'll be able to watch some video tutorials on how to not do stuff to me that you'll never  get to do.  She's an honest girl.  I love it.  I kind of like her, man.  You got to come back and see us.  For sure, Jackie.  All right, lady.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And good luck to you.  Yeah, whatever.  Thank you.  Bye.  Yeah, whatever.  Godspeed. 
[03:23:00]  Old Pete and Anthony have left the building.  After O.N.A. Live with Sam Roberts.  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  Remember this?  After O.P. and Anthony Live.  866-WOW-1-WOW if you want to call in and join the show. 
[03:23:30]  Where's Jim's advice at?  Don't worry about Jim's advice show.  I got some advice.  I thought we were doing that now.  Look for it on Wednesdays.  Thank God they opened the curtains.  I promise to keep it in my pants if I can get that light in here.  If I can feel like the room's open.  Sal's walking in feeling accomplished.  Roland is walking in.  Even though it turned out just to be a joke, you still ended up with a dick in the ass, didn't you, Roland?  You have no idea. 
[03:24:00]  The panic.  It was so funny.  You've got to listen to the replay of today's show.  I can't.  I can't.  I should have checked my Twitter or that before I hopped the subway, but I was just so panicked.  So what happened was, Sirius XM is doing, remember we did the concerts a while back.  We've talked about it on the air.  Paul McCartney at the Apollo.  Bruce.  Bruce at the Apollo.  And they're big deals because they're these massive acts in this tiny little venue.  The Apollo holds, how many people does it hold?  Maybe three or four.  Not even that, though.  You can't buy tickets.  Right, and it only holds three or four thousand people as it is. 
[03:24:30]  So you're going to this once-in-a-lifetime thing, and the next one they're doing is in September.  They have Metallica doing a show at the Apollo, and it's also to promote the movie, but Metallica's  also getting like a 24-hour pop-up channel, and I was reading that it's going to be on  the radio for like a month, but then it ends up, I don't know what that was, it ends up  on the website, SiriusXM.com, like for a year and a half or something like that. 
[03:25:00]  So it was a big secret, I guess.  I didn't even know it was happening, so it must have been a big secret, because I always  know when something's happening.  It was.  There's very little that goes on here that I don't know about well in advance.  I didn't know about this for a while, but it's still, I was like, ugh.  It was a big secret, though.  Yes.  So we made the announcement today, because Ant had read about it on Twitter last night,  and then I did a quick Google search before they actually said anything.  Yes, a quick Google search. 
[03:25:30]  No matter what you hear, I'm capable of that.  Nice.  And I saw that it was all over the Google News alerts.  Like, everybody was reporting that Metallica was doing this show.  So I go, okay, it's on Billboard, it's on ABC News.  And they tweeted it.  It's on Metallica.com.  And Metallica's tweeted it, and it's like everywhere.  So they say this, and, you know, say that it's happening.  They go to break.  And Sal runs in here with this look on his face of just sheer joy. 
[03:26:00]  Like, I finally have something.  Like, there is no way this one is going to turn around and bite me in the ass.  Because I don't have Sirius.  Because every time Sal runs in here with something, it's usually like, uh, I'm going to go for it,  but it's probably going to turn around and they're going to kill me for it, correct?  Absolutely.  But this time you were confident.  I was like, yeah, this one's good.  Because he ran in.  Because Roland first started texting Sal, panicking.  No, he first started texting E-Rock.  And E-Rock didn't say, E-Rock just goes, oh, Roland's texting me. 
[03:26:30]  He's freaking out.  I was like, oh, my God, this is perfect timing.  And then I text Roland.  He chimed in.  Oh, and then you, so.  He's like, oh, my God, dude, it's fucking bad.  Yeah, that's when I started panicking.  Me and Roland's conversation.  So how did you, how did you find out it had happened at all, Roland?  Um, uh.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I should probably.  I think Eric, Eric wrote, oh, my God.  I was like, what?  They're talking about it.  I was like, what?  Wait, Eric, you texted Roland and told him to begin with? 
[03:27:00]  No, no, no, no.  Hold on.  Somebody texted me that they're talking about Metallica at the concert.  I was like, oh, my God, they're not supposed to.  No, because I was talking to him originally about getting the stuff for Tyler's going away.  Which, by the way, we'll get to Tyler in a minute, but it was a half-eaten muffin with a pretzel rod.  Travis and I were hungry, so.  So you bit off the top?  Yes.  And it's the top part of the muffin, too.  It's the only part that anybody likes.  Man, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  We had to buy ourselves.  So whatever.  Roland somehow finds out, and he starts, like, texting Sal. 
[03:27:30]  Travis.  And E-Rock.  And Travis.  And everybody.  And he's panicked, and he's going, oh, Jesus, no.  Oh, I'm going to be fired.  I'm going to be killed.  I'm going to be murdered.  Why, God, why did this happen to me?  Jesus, why?  Jesus.  I texted Jimmy, too.  I was like, please, dude.  I thought this was in confidence.  And he said, I'm too excited.  Whatever.  Chill.  Well, yeah, I know.  He was reading all your texts on the air.  And then saying, I'm going to just tell him to chill.  And I was like, I knew, because that panicked me. 
[03:28:00]  Because when bad things happen, you say the same thing.  Just chill.  It'll be fine.  I was like, it's not going to be fine.  Oh, so you thought this was more of, you know there's something bad happening, and people  around you are telling you to calm down, because they don't realize the severity.  Because they don't need to come into work.  They don't want me to bail out at work.  Right.  So that's why I thought, oh, my, that's going to be bad.  Did you think you were going to be fired?  Or some, or maybe, because then Travis goes, green scenes, and I'm going to be on the hotline.  I was like, oh, no.  And he's like, our boss's boss's boss's boss.  And he's on vacation.  I go, oh, my God, this is bad. 
[03:28:30]  You believed him, that our boss's boss's boss's boss was calling into the show.  Because at the same time, Sal texted me, dude, hurry up.  They're looking for you.  It's bad.  Then I thought, oh, my God, Sal knows about Green scene, too.  You didn't know.  Everybody was just making shit up to talk about how bad it was.  One woman goes, are you okay?  Because I was just sweating in the subway.  I was like, yeah.  I was just so panicked.  Those stops in between the subway where you don't have cell service was probably, it probably felt like hours. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, and then I go, boop, boop, boop.  I was like, oh, no, oh, no.  Then I tried to reply.  It wouldn't go out.  I'm like, oh, my God, they got to stop.  And there goes, they're talking about it.  I was like, they got to stop.  And then that was the last I heard it from them.  Now, be honest.  When you walked in here, you were, even though you wouldn't say it, you were livid with Obi and Anthony and Jim.  I was between, basically, it wasn't really pissed.  It was just like, what's going to happen to me at that moment?  And why would you do it to me?  I was like, just come on.  Like, did you really fuck me over this bad, is what you're thinking? 
[03:29:30]  I was thinking, how am I going to get out of this one?  Without realizing that Google News had had it for eight hours already.  I went to bed early last night.  It wasn't feeling too well.  And then I woke up.  I don't turn on my phone.  I mean, I don't look at the internet.  I don't have Sirius.  So I didn't know what the hell was going on.  Oh, God.  And it was funny.  And then we were listening to you in E-Rock's little production studio.  So we went on and on with Roland about, you know, how bad this was.  And, like, how did you feel when Anthony was sitting in that chair to your face going, 
[03:30:00]  well, I found all this information out from Roland.  Roland told me.  What really panicked me when I saw the fans, like, saw, hey, thanks, Roland, for the announcement.  Well, all the fans started.  That, I felt that sinking feeling going, I'm fucked.  Right, because you knew that the Twitter was then going to go to SiriusXM.  Because they tag everybody.  Right.  It's not like, hey, Sam, and ha-ha.  It's like, at Sirius, at Metallica, at this, at this, at this.  Because you didn't know that they could tag as many people as they want.  The people that were tagged were like, yeah, this news has been out there since last night. 
[03:30:30]  I didn't know that.  So you walked back into the E-Rock studio after, like, we put you through the ringer for, like, half an hour.  And you walked back into E-Rock studio.  E-Rock had the mics on.  And we heard mumbling.  You called somebody a piece of shit.  Oh, I don't know who I, like.  And then you go.  Oh, because my phone wasn't working.  It was too slow.  And then, like, it was that scene in Superbad.  You called them a bunch of assholes.  Right.  And then you go, oh, those motherfuckers got me good.  Yes.  Because you realized. 
[03:31:00]  It was awesome.  It was awesome.  I was so, so panicked.  Now you're feeling better?  Is it still in you?  No, it's all right.  I mean, I went back there.  Gary and Rob loved it.  So I was like, they.  They thought it was funny?  Yeah, because I went through the ringer.  Oh, my God.  When you showed me the fan, your fucking face was like this.  Like, dude.  You pointed?  I was like.  I'm like, yeah.  Like, I gave him this face.  Like, I know we were all kidding around before.  But this is bad.  And then you go, hey, yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Sure, I did.  But you're like, dude.  E-Rock, how did it feel that Roland thought he might be getting fired?  And he wanted to use that opportunity for his last words to be slobo?  I was disappointed and hurt.  Right.  But.  It's an honor.  It was not an honor.  It's an honor.  It's not.  At that point, there was nothing honorable about your face, Roland.  It was a slobo.  No, you looked like Private Pyle.  You did.  E-Rock was in my ear going, he looks like Private Pyle.  Like, your eyes were going back.  Your eyes were, like, really tight and twitching. 
[03:32:00]  Like, you were like, if I'm going down for this, I'm taking everyone down with me.  Roland had that darkened brow.  Like, his eyebrows were lowered.  Like, he had that flush look in his face.  And it lets you into Roland's mind.  Like, you know, if the shit ever went down, Roland would take down as many people as humanly possible.  Like, anybody.  He's going to start swinging.  Anybody who thinks they have a relationship with Roland, if he's in trouble, he's going to take you down with him.  No.  No?  I would just say, well, I mean, I heard it from the guy from the middle channel. 
[03:32:30]  You were making shit up in here.  You tried throwing Sam under the bus.  You said, yeah, well, I heard it from Sam.  And I go, what are you talking about?  You're like, I didn't know what else you did, because I know Sam would go, yeah, yeah.  Because you always have to weasel your way out of the situation.  Well, I didn't have to weasel my, you made something up out of thin air.  Like, there's no weaseling out.  I just responded with the truth of, I didn't even know this was happening.  And you went, ah, you weaseled your way out again.  How'd you do that?  You always got a way out.  Because I tell the truth.  Eh, that's for, that's 2010 there.  I guess.

Well, Roland, I'm glad you're still working here.  Yeah, and actually, my favorite ticket was Eric texted me and he goes, yo, opening six 
[03:34:30]  tickets.  And they were like, oh, never mind.  I'll go through Gary.  I'm like, whoa.  That's right.  I'm like, oh, no.  Is that asking tickets?  Like, I don't know.  And you're sitting there going, oh, no.  He's going to ask for Gary.  Does that mean...  And then like a minute ago, I'll just ask Gary.  I was like, oh, no.  What's he doing?  Yeah.  That scared me very much.  It's so funny.  It's so funny.  I got to tell you.  I don't know.  I feel like a child.  Like, I can't handle travel anymore.  Because I was out...  The reason I wasn't here on Monday and Tuesday is because I've been out in Los Angeles.  I was there for a week, and I'm all jet-lagged up. 
[03:35:00]  Like, I haven't slept more than three hours on any night the last three nights.  Really?  Yeah.  You got jet-lagged?  I don't know.  I don't...  I didn't think I was going to get jet-lagged.  And I guess I was just sitting there in bed last night trying to figure out why I was  just exhausted and just staring at the ceiling, and it just hits you like a motherfucker.  I mean, I was up like...  I was shaving last night at midnight because I couldn't sleep.  I was like, wow, maybe if I had less stubble on my face, it'd be easier.  I don't know. 
[03:35:30]  I started writing shit down, just ideas or whatever.  I don't...  Because...  And then...  And then, on my way home from the airport, and maybe this is God telling me that I shouldn't  be traveling as much.  I got carsick.  Do you know...  What are you, six?  Exactly.  Did you puke up, like, a grilled cheese or something like that?  It was coming back from the airport back in New York.  My parents picked us up at the airport.  And look, we had a bit of a rocky landing when we landed on the plane. 
[03:36:00]  And when I was a child, when I was a kid, and that's acceptable, I never did well with  the landings.  Like, I was always fine on the plane, but then that landing came, and more than once, I had  to grab that little paper bag in the front of the seat.  You know what I'm saying?  But when you're an adult, you can't look around at other adults on the plane and be that one  dude who's, like, puking on an airplane in front of everybody.  It's gross.  And it's like, seriously, dude, handle your shit. 
[03:36:30]  It's an airplane.  Like, we've all been on them before.  So then we land, and I'm sitting there, and Jess is just looking at me like, what is wrong  with him?  Because I had my headphones on, and I was trying to concentrate on the people's court.  Because that's what was on the little TV in the seat.  Yeah, I was just trying to concentrate on Harvey to get my mind off of it, but I'm going,  and I'm sitting there, like, smacking my hands, like, whatever I gotta do, I'm like,  okay.  And I'm probably, I think I was mumbling, too. 
[03:37:00]  I was probably going, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  And Jess is sitting there, like, Jess is like, yeah, I mean, I guess I'm a little nauseous,  too, but what's going on next to me with this guy right now?  Sam's having an anxiety attack.  And she's going, she's looking at you, she's looking at me, going, like, are you okay?  And, like, I can't talk about it, because then they'll start, I'm going, yeah, fine,  fine, fine.  Like, I just had to brush her, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.  Okay, okay, okay.  It's all good, it's all good.  And the plane, and we hadn't eaten, so I guess that is something, and I hadn't slept, but still. 
[03:37:30]  And then we get in the car, and my parents picked us up, and we're driving, and we made  it most of the way, and we're in the backseat, because both my parents decided to pick us  up, because they had to both find out what, like, wonderful events happened while I was  in Los Angeles.  And, you know, my mom's asking me all these questions that, you know, are just nonsense.  Oh, where did you eat?  Oh, what did, did you like it?  Did you get dessert when you ordered?  And it's like, why would you need to know this many details about a story that isn't even 
[03:38:00]  a story to begin with?  Yeah, she wants to cook you with, like, later on.  You think she's trying to figure out if my tastes developed?  Yeah.  She needs to know every event that happens in the life of her Sammy, like, every little  tiny hour of every day, every detail.  She can't fathom that she's missed anything.  But I'm sitting there going, like, oh, this lady has to stop asking me questions, because  my stomach is starting to go loop-de-loops again.  Do you know what kind of place you have to be?  I'll be 30 years old in, like, two and a half weeks, and I had to ask my dad to pull over 
[03:38:30]  the car on the highway and be like, you got to pull over, dude.  You got to pull over.  I mean, I felt a little better about myself, because, like, usually when I get sick, I  throw up like a little kid, and there's just dry heaving.  But, like, I kind of threw up like an alcoholic.  Like, I just, because I had waited so long, I guess, I just jumped out of the car and just  went, blah, and just, you know, like, right out of the side of the mouth, blah, and I'm 
[03:39:00]  back in the car, but I couldn't believe that at this age I'm still getting, like, motion  sickness.  Oh my god, I just, I'm sorry.  No, go ahead.  No, no, no, something about the Roland story.  What about it?  I found a tweet.  This guy literally tweeted a screen cap to Roland, to Opie, to Jim, to Ant, to you, and  Eric at five in the morning today.  And then the guy responds to himself, never mind, well played.  How can I be more on top of my shit when I'm throwing up and not sleeping, Roland? 
[03:39:30]  I don't know.  Makes you question things, doesn't it?  Roland does that every day.  What?  Throw up and not sleep.  Throws up and not sleep?  Yeah, but he makes up for it in the office.  That's true.  A little naps throughout the afternoon.  I have a little blood sugar.  It's a disease I suffer with.  You're right, I shouldn't be making fun of that.  Yeah, it's a disease.  Psycho Bob.  Hey, Sam.  Mm-hmm.  You're talking about having trouble sleeping.  Is this your way of telling us that maybe there's a little Sam on the way? 
[03:40:00]  Do you think I'm pregnant?  It's morning sickness?  I'm wondering.  I'm wondering.  Oh, no.  I hope I'm not pregnant.  I can't be pregnant right now.  Are you bloating at all?  I feel like a little bit.  Sal, do I look like I'm bloating?  Do I have a glow?  A little bit, yeah.  Do I have a glow about me?  You're glowing, dude.  And your feet are swollen a little bit.  Oh, man.  I can't lose my figure now.  Not this early on.  I'm not ready.  No, I don't think I'm pregnant.  I'm a man.  Unless I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger in the hit film Junior, I don't think I'm pregnant.  But it is just a horrible thing. 
[03:40:30]  Because I figured when I was out in L.A., we were leaving early, so we didn't sleep much  before we got on the plane.  Because I'm like, okay, we'll get on the plane.  We'll be tired.  We'll come home.  Everything will whip right back into shape.  No.  I just lay in bed tired and not sleeping.  So you should stop by In-N-Out Burger's before you went to the airport.  It's like right next to it.  Okay.  Well, it's like 5.30 in the morning, and how would that have helped me sleep?  It wouldn't, but your tummy would have been happy.  You think that I wouldn't have gotten motion sickness if I went to In-N-Out Burger at 5.30 
[03:41:00]  in the morning?  Yeah.  Definitely would have made it worse.  Roland, you have the most unhappy tummy of anybody I've ever encountered.  It gets around.  I will never take digestive advice from you.  Anytime I say to Roland, oh, man, my stomach's killing me or something.  I said, Roland always is like, yeah, I puked last night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said it.  He said it earlier.  He goes, you know, last night I went to bed.  I wasn't feeling well.  There has never been a night that Roland has said, no, I went to bed at a reasonable time 
[03:41:30]  and felt good.  Yeah.  Do you ever go to sleep not feeling bad?  No, I do.  A few days ago, fantastic.  Went to bed at 8 o'clock.  Passed out.  There was one day.  A few days ago.  There was one.  Yeah.  There was one time when I felt like a human being.  It was after Suits.  I was like, oh, wow.  That was a great show.  That's it.  Yeah.  Suits puts me to sleep, too.  Nobody watches it.  It's boring.  It's awesome.  No, it's not.  This week's was amazing.  I bet it was.  Flashback.  Unfortunately, no, we watched it.  What was the story you told me?  It was another thing.  I was like, yeah, I was sick last night. 
[03:42:00]  And Roland was like, yeah, I got to my apartment.  I couldn't even make it upstairs.  And Roland just was puking on the street in downtown Manhattan.  What?  No, no.  Why were you puking on the street?  You went to the bathroom on the street?  No.  No, no.  I thought he puked on the street.  No, I didn't puk.  I didn't take a shit on the street.  Can I remember?  We didn't get to the bathroom.  I went to take the subway.  Oh, that's right.  How many times do you shit?  I don't know.  In a given day?  If I'm lucky, maybe five.  Maybe five.  By the way, by the way, when somebody says how many times do you shit a day, you shouldn't 
[03:42:30]  have to pause for thought.  That shouldn't be like, I don't know.  What the fuck am I supposed to know in a day?  A ton.  When we went out to you for the other day, Roland made me get chili for lunch as an appetizer.  That's right.  We went to some steakhouse or something, and Roland was like, no, my friend Sal will have  the chili as well.  And I was like, do I really?  I mean, yeah, chili sounds nice, but as an appetizer to lunch, I'm not going to eat anything  for the rest of the day.  Sal's going, okay, I'll have a cup of chili.  Roland, bring in the bowl.  Bring in the bowl of chili.  Go ahead.  And I couldn't even make it home. 
[03:43:00]  I had to come back here and shit.  It was terrible.  Do you ever think about changing your diet?  Like, I'm sitting here, like, I'm trying to figure out if there's something, when I  get something where I'm not sleeping, like, I'm not, and I'm just, I know, I see you in  the office all the time, and I, but I wake up, like, after three hours, it's just, like,  where the fuck am I?  Everything hurts.  I'm nauseous.  I don't know what's going on, because you can't sleep for three hours at a time.  It's not the way a body's supposed to behave.  Like, last night I was exhausted, so I fell asleep on the couch at, like, eight o'clock, 
[03:43:30]  right?  But then I woke up at nine, and I was like, okay, I'll just stumble into bed and fall  right back to sleep.  That's what you're supposed to do.  Nope.  Nope.  Staring at the ceiling.  Midnight shave.  I just want, it's, it's torture to be sitting there, and you're lying in bed, and you shut  your eyes, right?  Because you're like, no, I am going to just drift back off to sleep.  And you can actually feel yourself getting less and less tired.  Yeah.  Like, you can feel the, I just woke up, uh, drowsiness fading away, and you're like, 
[03:44:00]  oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.  And then thoughts start coming through, and then you start thinking of things, and then  you start planning things, then you start coming up with ideas, and then, that's it.  You've lost it.  It happened to me last night.  I was, I was up pretty late, and then I had, like, a snack at, like, 12, 12 at night,  and I was like, all right, I'm exhausted, I'm going to go to sleep.  And then I ended up watching, like, Mythbusters on my phone from, like, one to two in the  morning, like, all right, I've got to get up in two hours, this is going to be great.  Exactly.  And you're sitting there, like, I'm, like, figuring out a strategy, like, what am I going 
[03:44:30]  to say?  I ended up, I sat down in the kitchen, and just started writing down everything that  was going on in my head, while my cat just sat there batting me with his paw.  He doesn't want anything, he's just bothering me.  I can't sleep, cat.  Leave me alone.  But I'm sitting there, when that stuff is happening, I'm sitting there going, how can  I fix this?  How can I improve this?  This can't be my reality.  Especially, I start panicking.  When I'm, like, I'm tired, and I'm not sleeping.  Like, I start going, like, holy shit, is this going to be my life from now on? 
[03:45:00]  I always counted on the fact that if I don't sleep, I'll get tired, and I'll be able to  sleep the next night.  If this is just life now, I've got to kill myself.  There's no other options.  Yeah, I'll do that, too.  If I'm up, like, late the night before, I'm like, all right, I'll just come home the  next day.  Right.  And go sleep from three to four.  Right.  But it never works out like that.  Right.  I'll be like, okay, here's what I do.  So, you know, like, yesterday, I was like, okay, I was up all afternoon doing work.  And I was like, okay, well, this means at night I'll be able to sleep. 
[03:45:30]  And then when I didn't sleep at night, I was like, oh, this is going to make my tomorrow  a disaster.  How am I not sleeping?  But you, Rowan, you sit there like, oh, yeah, I shit myself all the time.  And you never, you never, like...  You pop through it.  You don't think to yourself, how can I stop this from happening?  I just pop through things.  That'll be fine.  You don't worry about that?  What if I do worry?  You don't sit there going, well, maybe I shouldn't be having chili with every meal.  I know.  Yeah.  If I...  Obviously, I'm shitting myself five times a day.  This is not good. 
[03:46:00]  You don't think that...  You're just saying, well, this is just life.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys pulled the joke on me, scared me, so then...  That has nothing to do with...  It is.  That's how my life is.  No, no, no.  You guys throw me down a bad path.  You...  No, it's not.  It's you putting you down a bad path.  You can't...  Don't you think to yourself, look, I fall asleep all...  I don't sleep like a regular night.  You don't think that to yourself?  Yeah.  Like, you just go, ah, I'll sleep for like four hours here, take a nap in the office. 
[03:46:30]  Like, you fall...  The first time I fell asleep in a meeting, and I've never fallen asleep in a meeting, but  the first time I fell asleep in a meeting in front of bosses and stuff, I'd be like,  okay, my habits have got to change, because that is humiliating.  Like, it's a funny story, but it's embarrassing.  You're like, oh, good, I got the meeting.  I can take a little resty.  A little nap-ski.  Oh, God.  I love when Roland's watching trailers for movies, for like, you know, for booking guests  and stuff, and Roland is just dozing off. 
[03:47:00]  Like, his head's gonna hit the screen, you know?  You could see him in a conversation.  If you talk to Roland, and you're talking to him for long enough without asking him a  question that he can answer, you see his eyes start to flutter, and you're like,  it doesn't matter how exciting the story you're talking about is.  Like, at first, I would question myself, like, am I that boring?  But then I realized, no, I'm dealing with a narcoleptic.  Quite often, Eric will, like, tap me on the shoulder and, like, you know, like, do,  like, the quiet, be quiet thing, and, like, he'll just point to Roland, and I'll be out  cold.  Out cold.  You're good with it, though. 
[03:47:30]  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Let me go to Larry.  It's been a while since we had an after show.  I'm leaving.  I'll talk to you guys later.  You don't like Larry?  I like Larry, but it's just, like, the same thing all the time.  What do you think he's gonna say?  Oh, Sammy Primetime, Sweetheart Roberts.  Larry!  Sam Roberts, Professional Broadcast.  There you go.  What's up, buddy?  Sam, exercise will help you sleep.  It'll take about a week or two weeks.  Just do daily exercise, and I tell you now, you will sleep like a baby.  You will drop immediately off to sleep. 
[03:48:00]  You will wake up refreshed.  It really helps.  Yeah, but then I'm like, I can't motivate myself to do any exercise.  I'm like, ah, I'm tired.  I don't want to exercise.  Yeah, but I'm just talking about modest exercise.  I'm not talking about, you know, busting your gut and, you know, having all those good muscle aches, pains.  I'm talking about just a, you know, a very brisk walk for 20, 30, 40 minutes a day or a jog of a mile a day.  You'd be amazed at it.  After a couple of weeks, how it'll help you sleep.  Maybe I'll start trying to briskly walk. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, that'll work.  Seriously, it really does help.  Like a 30, 40 minute brisk walk really helps.  And after a couple of weeks, you'll really notice your sleep is a lot higher quality.  All right, well, that's right.  Thanks, Larry.  And the other thing on the motion sickness, Sam, there's a reason cruise ships feed you 24-7.  You got to fill up the stomach?  Don't get motion sick.  That's correct.  Eric, you get motion sickness?  No, not usually.  That makes sense.  Larry's probably right then.  I knew that now. 
[03:49:00]  Walked right into it.  Didn't he, Rowan?  I thought that was.  Eric, you got what I was saying, right?  Yeah, I know.  It's not much for you to do that to the sex bagel.  I can only say one thing to that sex bagel, and that's, oh, my God!  Legos, I love it, Larry.  Thank you very much.  Just kidding, Eric.  I got to tell you, though.  I think a lot of us are going to have trouble sleeping tonight because tomorrow is the world's  end.  Have you seen the world's end yet, Rowan?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I got the cups.  What a film.  You got cups?  I got the glass, the whole set of the bars. 
[03:49:30]  So you're all about the world's end.  You're very excited.  Yeah, it was really funny.  From the guys who brought you Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, the world's end is about one  night.  Six friends and the pub crawl that will end them all.  Simon Pegg, he's the actor who plays Scotty in the new Star Trek movies, gets his high school  buddies to return to their hometown for an epic pub crawl that they weren't able to finish  20 years ago.  The route is called the Golden Mile.  It stops at 12 bars, finishing up at the final place, the world's end. 
[03:50:00]  It's all a drunken good time until they discover that the town has been taken over by what?  You've been waiting for a twist.  An army of killer robots?  Then there's a lot of fighting, exploding, robot heads, and of course, drinking.  It turns out that if these guys want to survive the night, they have to make it all the way  to the world's end.  New York Magazine raves it's the most entertaining movie of the year.  There's been a lot of entertaining movies this year.  GQ Magazine says it's rip-roaring and hilarious. 
[03:50:30]  And Richard Roper declares it's funny as hell.  Ooh, the potty mouth on that Richard Roper.  Remember, don't miss this blockbuster sci-fi comedy.  See it on the big screen.  The world's end is in theaters everywhere tomorrow.  What does a professional broadcaster, comma, Sam Roberts say about it?  I haven't seen the film yet.  I will.  I saw your jobs review.  I will review it.  Did you?  Yes, I did.  What did you think?  Well, you were kind.  What do you mean I was kind?  You could have been crueler. 
[03:51:00]  Well, I try not to.  I've been doing YouTube movie reviews, you know?  And I don't want to be mean about it.  I want to maintain a little bit of integrity about it.  You got your point across, though.  But I tried to get my point across.  I did not like jobs.  I thought...  You said, yeah, good job, Kelso.  I thought our buddy Josh Gad did great in it.  He's actually a good actor.  But I felt bad for him because he was stuck in this movie that was just not a good movie.  It wasn't.  And I thought I made that point very clear on the Sam Roberts movie reviews on YouTube. 
[03:51:30]  What's your next movie?  I don't know.  You know what I watched on the plane ride to L.A.?  The Canyons.  I think maybe I'll do a review of The Canyons, the Lindsay Lohan movie that went right to  Video On Demand.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  If you ever want to make a six-hour plane ride seem like 12, put The Canyons on for an  hour and a half of it.  What a stink-a-roo that was.  Lindsay Lohan's big comeback movie, although her titties were in it.  I think I saved that for your YouTube.  And that's always good. 
[03:52:00]  Don't waste it here?  Don't waste it.  All right.  Nick in Chicago.  Hey, Sam.  I've been having problems sleeping for about 10 years.  And I used to be an addict as well.  And there's a prescription called Trazodone, which is non-addictive.  And you won't have any withdrawal symptoms.  Like, if you take it for a week and then stop taking it.  And about 100 milligrams, you'll sleep like a baby.  Or if that doesn't work sometimes, smoke a little pot.  And that just drops me right to sleep.  But usually the Trazodone works beautifully.  And your doctor won't give you a hard time because it's not addictive. 
[03:52:30]  And you should be able to sleep fine with that.  Well, thank you, Nick.  I mean, I'm doing it drug-free.  Yeah, just do a pot.  And then you'll be stoned.  Messed at work.  Right.  No, I don't want to take pills.  But I'm assuming jet lag wears off eventually.  Yeah.  Rick in Brooklyn.  It's because I've got so many.  Who kid?  He just sleeps whenever he's done fucking.  Like, he just has sex with somebody and then falls asleep.  Me, I've got so many genius ideas just rumbling around in this giant head of mine that it makes things like this difficult. 
[03:53:00]  What's up, Rick?  Hey, buddy.  Let me get this straight.  Larry called up giving you exercise tips, right?  Mm-hmm.  This fat, overweight truck driver is giving you one of the most skinniest guys I've ever seen.  True.  True.  Fucking exercise tips.  That's true.  And that advice of taking a brisk walk for 30 or 40 minutes, that really is fat guy exercise, isn't it? 
[03:53:30]  That huge fat guy exercise.  I won't even do it.  And I'm not overweight, but still, I'm not going to fucking walk for 40 minutes.  No, fuck that.  Thank you, Rick.  Hey, I got a question.  Yeah.  It's pretty much for Roland.  Roland, when can I get on the ticket list for Metallica?  I want to be one of the first fans to get tickets.  Come on.  I live in Brooklyn.  Hook me up.  You're going to hook him up, Roland?  We'll just take one away from Opie's.  He doesn't need six pairs. 
[03:54:00]  Well, Opie doesn't actually need.  He wasn't actually asking for tickets.  Oh.  You were getting fucked with again.  Oh, man.  I mean, he would like to go, of course, but E-Rock just made that up.  Yeah, I don't have control over the tickets.  When he sent it to you.  So, but yeah, the L.A. trip was very good.  I don't know if you guys are following my progress on Twitter and YouTube, but I interviewed every wrestler you could possibly think of.  Was it you, your wife, and McFoley on vacation, or just you and your wife?  I did Burt Kreischer's podcast. 
[03:54:30]  You remember Burt.  He was on, he's been on the show before.  He does a podcast at BurtCast.com.  And TripFlip.  And he does TripFlip and Burt the Conqueror and all that stuff.  He's on the Travel Channel all the time.  He's hilarious.  I love that guy.  But I did his podcast, and I was going to do it anyway.  But then he said, oh yeah, I'm having Mick Foley on the podcast.  You should come do it.  You should come be on that one.  And I was like, oh, okay, yeah, I'll do that.  But then, like, I saw Mick Foley at a red carpet event.  Then I interviewed him at the SummerSlam Radio Row event. 
[03:55:00]  In the video game.  Then I saw him, right.  I saw him at the video game press conference.  How did you know about that?  Publishes email me.  I know everything.  Yeah, I saw Mick Foley at the video game press conference.  And, like, he gave me this.  Like, to the point, I saw him so much that I ran into his daughter at the SummerSlam FanFest.  And she was like, oh, hey, how's it going?  Because now we have a relationship.  We've crossed paths that many times over this weekend.  And I was sitting there, like, at the video game press conference deal. 
[03:55:30]  And all these wrestlers are on stage.  And Mick Foley, like, waved to me because he saw me in the second row.  So, and I think, Jess was telling me not to be so hard on myself that, you know, I just, she said, no, no, no.  He likes you.  He knows you're supposed to be here.  But in my head, all I can think is Mick Foley is looking down at me like, will this fucking weirdo leave me alone?  And the last time you came to the studio, you were right here co-hosting.  Yeah, I'm just here like, nope, my show too.  And Mick's like, who the fuck is this guy? 
[03:56:00]  And then I show up at Bert's house.  And I actually said that on the podcast.  Bert was like, he goes, do you have any wrestling questions for Mick Foley?  I go, no, I don't have any wrestling questions.  I feel like Mick Foley thinks I'm just some weirdo who's following him around this weekend.  And you know what Mick said?  He said, I've thought that for a long time now.  Not just this weekend.  He was Stone Cold.  He liked it.  But he said, yeah, he was here.  He was there.  He was here.  Yeah, I interviewed Stone Cold a couple times.  The second one's going up today.  He might be coming to New York soon.  Oh, that's good.  We have a relationship now.  I'm going to air all, a whole bunch. 
[03:56:30]  If you want to hear a bunch of these interviews, and they're all good.  You don't have to be a wrestling fan.  You watch a bunch of them, right?  Yeah, I don't watch wrestling, but I watch interviews.  And they're fun, right?  Yeah, The Miz.  Right.  So if you want to, Fandango was hilarious.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  You remember Fandango.  I actually got to talk to him.  You can hear his voice and everything.  It's the girl he's on television with.  Oh, I didn't know.  He's a storyline girl.  But on Sunday, on the Sam Roberts show, I'm going to put together a shit ton of all the  interviews and stuff I did out in L.A. over the weekend. 
[03:57:00]  So that'll be fun.  Let's go to Ryan in the Bronx.  Sammy.  What's up, Ryan?  This is Racist Francesa, which I want to put an end to.  I want to introduce myself as Ryan.  I'm Ryan.  Okay.  Well, I mean, we also love Racist Francesa, so maybe Ryan on the after show, Racist Francesa  on O&A.  No, I just don't want to be pigeonholed.  You know what I mean?  Good for you, Ryan.  Good for you.  I mean, a lot of people, they used to just say, oh, primetime Sam Roberts, primetime Sam  Roberts.  Now, it's like, no, no, no. 
[03:57:30]  That's Sam Roberts, comma, professional broadcaster.  It's like El Generico.  Now he's Sammy Zang.  You know what I mean?  You're going very inside with that one, Ryan.  Right.  It's just for me and you.  Yeah, go ahead.  I love the interviews, man.  You do such a good job.  I got a quick question, and then I have an idea for you.  Okay.  The question is, who's the biggest asshole wrestler?  Like, not necessarily was nasty to you, but you're not comfortable.  I don't know that I've ever had an experience with a wrestler where they've been an asshole.  Like, I've gone in thinking they could be an asshole. 
[03:58:00]  Like, Roland, this was great.  You would have loved it.  You remember we went and interviewed the Ultimate Warrior, right?  And we were like, oh, we don't know how this is going to go.  He's kind of a weirdo.  But the interview was good.  On Sunday, we went and had brunch, and the Ultimate Warrior was the speaker.  And it was too funny because the Ultimate Warrior, he gets up on stage, and I guess it's there because they're doing, he's going to be in this wrestling video game.  And he's there to promote the game.  But his first words that come out of his mouth, he gets up on stage, and he goes, well, fuck. 
[03:58:30]  And we're all like, what?  And then Ultimate Warrior is like, you know, after he said, well, fuck.  He goes, they told me one thing, not to drop any F-bombs while I was up here.  But that's all this whole vibe is.  Fuck it, you know?  I'm just like, no, I don't know what you're saying.  But he went on to give this, like, motivational speech thing, and he was great.  And they were lining up people to get pictures with the Ultimate Warrior.  And most people had not met him.  I got online because Jess was with me. 
[03:59:00]  And I was like, my life won't be complete until I have a picture with the Ultimate Warrior and Jess.  So we go up, and we say hi.  And as we're walking up, the Ultimate Warrior goes, Sam!  And I'm like, what the fuck is going on?  The Ultimate Warrior just, like, said hi to me by my name.  And he goes, he goes, Sam, I know what the Haps is now.  My daughter gave me a ton of heat for that.  And I go, Jesus Christ, I can't believe I made an impact on your life.  But that's to say, you know, the Ultimate Warrior is awesome to me. 
[03:59:30]  There's been, I can't think of any wrestler that's...  The other guy was there during the interview.  Yeah.  When she yelled, like, hey, this man said, yeah.  Yeah, I can't really think of any wrestler that's been an anus to me.  Virgil?  Except maybe Virgil.  Yeah, Virgil's an asshole.  I went up to him once and asked him for an interview, and he said he was too busy making money,  which was obviously a lie if you've ever been to LonelyVirgil.net.  Who's the one that you pay him?  He'll give you a shot across the chest.  That's Greg the Hammer Valentine.  You know, I had an incident with Virgil once, Sam. 
[04:00:00]  So, who's the biggest asshole you've met, Eric?  That would have to be Virgil.  Virgil, okay, that's the name.  Virgil, of course, autographed Eric's million dollar belt without his knowledge or consent.  And then tried to charge me for it.  Awesome.  So, what was your, what was the other thing, Ryan?  I'm glad he rocked there, all right?  Now, just let this sink in, and I'm going to hang up.  Okay.  Sam Roberts.  Mm-hmm.  Eric Nagel.  Mm-hmm.  Myself.  Wrestling Discussion. 
[04:00:30]  Let's put these fuckers out of business.  Yeah, all right, you hang up, you hang up, I'll think about it.  Come on!  But then I could also just do it by myself.  So, I don't know what exactly Ryan, the voice of Racist Francesa, is.  And Sam doesn't like my ideas anyway.  Right, and Eric would just frustrate me because he's a fan-fiction hour.  Yeah, Eric would just read his fan-fictions for a while.  How about I do it, and then I bring in Eric for five minutes a show, and give him a fan-fiction segment?  Well, I'm not the creep following Mick Foley everywhere.  Listen, we're friends. 
[04:01:00]  Okay?  That is true.  And then, I don't know if he thinks I'm putting people up to it.  I'm starting to get paranoid because, like, it might be too much.  Like, I might need a break.  Because I saw some guy tweets me, and he goes, hey, I just met Mick Foley at an autograph signing.  Mentioned your name.  And I go, I don't know if he wants this.  Then Mick Foley does an AMA on Reddit, Ask Me Anything.  And one of the questions from a guy on Reddit is, when you fed steak to Sam Roberts on the Opie and Anthony show, was it the greatest moment of your career? 
[04:01:30]  He can't go anywhere.  Was it the greatest moment of yours?  Of mine?  And it was probably what launched me.  I can't say it was the greatest moment, but it was...  I saw Joe Villain, your background of all your videos.  I mean, we were hanging in...  I like when your wife's filming, she's, like, trying to give you the wrap-up sign.  I was like, Jess, he hasn't paid no mind to that.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  It's like, did we only have, like, two minutes with Ultimate Warrior?  Ended with ten.  Yeah, don't worry about the wrap-up sign.  I put Jess to work, too.  You know what I had to do?  Was she mad filming all the...  That's a lot of arm work. 
[04:02:00]  Jess was running around filming interviews with me, and I gotta say, I gotta get her a gift after all that.  And I'm trying to figure out what the best gift to give the woman in my life is, and I figured it out.  The best gift for any occasion.  Carrot cake?  Or no occasion at all.  No, it's not carrot cake.  It's an I love you gift.  What is an I love you gift?  Well, it's a gift that says, without words, how much she truly means to you.  It shows how much you love her, appreciate her, value her.  Something you gotta remind her of, and it's something she can keep forever and look at every day to remind her how much you love her.

[04:03:30]  No, Roland.  I don't want it looking like you.  Rich on Long Island.  Yeah, what's going on, Sam?  What's up, buddy?  Listen, I was actually wondering, what are your ambitions in this industry?  What exactly are you trying to achieve?  Because I've got to tell you, I really, really enjoy you on After ONA.  Of course, I enjoy you during the regular show.  Right.  But, you know, I honestly think that you should be on, okay, 11 to 3.  I'm really getting sick of these other guys that you've got on there.  I'm not going to mention any names. 
[04:04:00]  You mentioned their time slot, and I appreciate the compliment, Rich, but I think Ron and Fez will be safe in their position.  I mean, obviously, I would like to move on from doing an after show to doing an actual show.  I've made that quite clear to everybody.  The immediate goal, this is not what I want to happen tomorrow.  It's what should have happened yesterday, is for me to have my own show that's independent of any other brand.  That's the goal.  Monday through Friday, a daily show.  That's the immediate goal.  Now, moving forward, there's lots of stuff I have in mind. 
[04:04:30]  But that's what should have happened yesterday.  Not from 11 to 3, because we have a fantastic show that's on from 11 to 3 on this very channel.  They're called the Ron and Fez Show.  They're coming up next.  I thank you all so much.  I hate you, Sal.  And I will see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the ONA Show on Facebook at facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  And catch O.P. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  The Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey!
