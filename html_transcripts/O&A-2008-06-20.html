<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a self-promotional segment highlighting their controversial nature, announcing a jam-packed show featuring Mike Myers (promoting *The Love Guru*), Stephen Lynch, Big A, Tippy Tom (a homeless friend), Dr. Steve, and Brie Olsen.  Myers’ demanding rider, including specific food and drink requests, is a source of amusement. The hosts playfully compare Myers' star power to Tippy Tom's, favoring the latter.

A significant portion focuses on Anthony's relationship with Jill Nicolini (Antellini), heavily featuring a CW11 video of their Dave & Buster's date.  The video shows them playing games, including an incident with a malfunctioning claw machine, and elicits humorous commentary from the hosts.  A caller, Maria, questions the authenticity of their relationship, suggesting it's a publicity stunt, which Anthony vehemently denies.  This discussion continues throughout the show, fueled by listener calls expressing skepticism.

A caller, Tom, who previously discussed suicidal thoughts, calls in to update the hosts after a suicide attempt resulting in SWAT intervention and a psychiatric hospital stay. He credits Anthony and the Antellini relationship as an inspiration, contradicting earlier media reports. The hosts react with a mix of humor and concern.  A segment on musical rip-offs follows, featuring Danny playing examples of similar songs by various artists, including Chuck Berry and The Beach Boys, Brian Adams and Green Day, Paris Hilton and UB40, Avril Lavigne and Peaches, Ray Parker Jr. and Huey Lewis, and Coldplay and Creaky Boards/Joe Satriani.  The show concludes with continued discussion of Tom's situation and plans to further investigate musical plagiarism.

Early in the show, a humorous exchange involving a porn star and a "Cream Pie" reference precedes a discussion about a man whose girlfriend is lazy and financially dependent on him. Opie mentions his side project band and plays a riff.  The hosts again detail Myers' extravagant rider, contrasting it with their own, using humorous examples of questionable deli meats.  The pre-recorded video of Anthony's date with Antellini at Dave & Buster's is shown, featuring self-deprecating comments from Anthony and negative viewer reactions.  Further discussion of their relationship and future plans ensues, along with a "FU Line" segment featuring angry listener messages.

Mike Myers' in-studio interview focuses on his career, including *Saturday Night Live*, *Austin Powers*, and *The Love Guru*. He discusses his family background, father's death, comedic influences, collaborations with Dana Carvey and Chris Farley, hockey, admiration for Peter Sellers, upcoming projects, and the writer's strike. Opie plays another musical riff.

A segment heavily features the alleged plagiarism of Led Zeppelin's "Taurus" from Spirit, referencing the biography "Hammer of the Gods" and leading to a broader discussion on musical plagiarism, with one host admitting to copying other artists.  The conversation shifts to Anthony's relationship with Jill Nicolini, their tumultuous relationship, and their reconciliation facilitated by Mick Foley.  Audio clips and video from their one-month anniversary at Dave & Buster's are played and discussed, with humorous commentary from the hosts and Stephen Lynch.

Stephen Lynch performs a heavily censored song, "Waiting," with explicit lyrics about STIs and sexual acts, and another based on a purported Anne Frank diary entry.  He discusses touring in Europe and previous appearances on the show.  The latter half features Tippy Tom, whose odor is a running gag, and Cream Pie Jones, who recounts a nervous breakdown after a planned birthday lap dance from a porn star.  The segment ends with Anthony abruptly leaving for the Bahamas with Jill Nicolini.

A segment focuses on Cream Pie Jones' previous vomiting incident on his 21st birthday.  Brie Olsen, a Penthouse Pet, is brought in to help him ejaculate. The segment contains highly explicit sexual content, including Olsen performing sexual acts on Cream Pie Jones, resulting in him ejaculating.  Olsen's breasts are exposed.  The hosts, E-Rock’s father, and Dr. Steve provide highly suggestive commentary.  Olsen's signing event is promoted.  The show continues with Dr. Steve performing prostate exams on Big A and Tippy Tom with explicit descriptions.  Other guests, including Eastside Dave and Tom, are briefly mentioned or appear.

A humorous impromptu medical examination of Tom occurs, focusing on his swollen ankles.  Opie and PA John offer to perform a prostate and rectal exam live on air.  Tom agrees, leading to exaggerated descriptions and reactions.  The exam concludes with a clean bill of health for his prostate, but his ankle issues remain.  The segment includes discussions of Tom’s walking, runner-up lines of the day, plugs for websites and events (including Brie Olsen's website, Dr. Steve's show, Big A’s birthday party, and Jimmy's Gong Show appearance), and a brief appearance by Erock’s father.  The show mentions only taking Monday off, concluding with a Mike Myers ad.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs.  Opie and Anthony.  Refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Where are you driving to kick somebody out of the house?  No, I'm driving to a television program where I work here in Hollywood.  Opie and Anthony.  John, where do you work?  I work on Long Island.  I can't really tell you that.  Oh, what radio station?  Star, I know. 
[00:01:00]  Exactly!  Opie and Anthony.  I like boobies because I wasn't breastfed as a child.  Aw.  It's like Opie keeps E-Rock around.  For a good suckling.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  We got a busy show today.  Hi.  Good morning to everybody. 
[00:01:30]  Morning.  We got Mike Myers coming by at 745 this morning to talk about the love guru.  Right.  We're running around Manhattan trying to get all his demands met for the big interview.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, my God.  He's got a rider for his radio interview.  Ooh.  We're very excited to have Mike Myers in today.  But what does he need?  He needs like silk milk.  He needs Twizzlers.  He needs, what, cantaloupe?  We need fruit salad.  We do need silk. 
[00:02:00]  The soy milk.  You know, fake cream.  He also wants a specific kind of sparkling water.  It's a raspberry flavored Poland spring.  And, of course, the red Twizzlers and a certain fruit salad.  So the fresh fruit salad is being made as we speak.  All right.  Twizzlers.  Let's keep note of where that fruit salad is made.  So the next time we want some, we don't have to have a plastic fruit with water on it.  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  All for a half-hour interview.  Also, we've got Stephen Lynch and old friends stopping by to say hi this morning. 
[00:02:30]  Big A's coming by.  Tippy Tom, our homeless friend, is coming by today.  Action-packed.  Dr. Steve is coming by.  And Brie Olsen.  Can I point out how that list really does taper off?  Mike Myers.  Stephen Lynch, Big A, Tippy Tom, and Dr. Steve.  And Brie Olsen.  And then Brie Olsen brings us back up a little bit.  I'll put her between Mike and Stephen.  I was trying to sell them all the same way, too. 
[00:03:00]  You notice that?  Mike Myers got the same as Tippy Tom did.  That's the beauty of this radio show.  877-212-ON-A.  I'm going to hold my opinion until after the interview.  About what?  About who's bigger and better for the show.  I am going to go with...  Tippy Tom?  Tippy Tom will be the star of today's radio show.  Of course he is.  It's very exciting to have someone like Mike Myers in.  But are we really going to get the crazy radio out of here? 
[00:03:30]  We're going to get Golden Buns.  Golden Buns will bring it home for us today.  Of course he will.  And Big A.  Also, I think Roland's stopping by to do Tragic News.  He's going to be in an odor smorgasbord today.  Oh, yeah.  With these people.  And every time Dr. Steve comes to New York, he wants to give somebody a prostate exam.  I don't understand how that started, but we've got to humor him and keep his bit going. 
[00:04:00]  So somebody around here will be getting a prostate exam once again on the show.  Perhaps it was you egging him on.  What?  Perhaps I even think there might have been a threat.  What?  That he wouldn't have his Saturday show if he didn't perform a prostate exam.  That's right there was.  There will be more fingers disappearing today.  Right.  Because Dr. Steve is in town.  Yes.  I'm thinking it's Big A's turn.  Thank you, doctor. 
[00:04:30]  That was very good.  It was a good exam.  Yeah.  I have to get back to see my first baseman's mission.  I see Anthony has a bag packed and ready to go.  Well, one of them, yeah.  And you're keeping your eye on it because that's what the airports tell you.  Well, yeah.  I have my luggage that gets checked and then my carry-on.  And your carry-on always has your important stuff in it.  So I like keeping it near me at all times.  Right.  Because, you know, what am I going to do, leave it in my truck in the garage? 
[00:05:00]  Leave it out in the office with people riffraff that I don't know who they are from CBS FM?  But then you could also give the correct answer when they say, you know, has the luggage been in your sight the entire time?  Indeed it has.  This is what they mean by that because a lot of people don't just pack minutes before they go to the airport.  Or, you know, you have to watch it all day long.  Yeah.  So you'll keep an eye on it.  You're just going to be watching your carry-on.  I got it right there next to me.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Where are you going? 
[00:05:30]  I am going to the Bahamas.  To get married.  What?  That seems to be speculation.  I've read a lot of that.  Where is all this speculation?  Oh, whack bag.  Oh.  It's all over the place.  It's everywhere on all media outlets.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  Yeah, that's just like Perez Hilton and TMZ and what would Tyler Durden do?  Exactly.  They're right up there with those websites.  Well, you know, these rumors have to start somewhere.  You know, we did a very big piece yesterday for the CW11 website over at Dave & Buster's in the city here, Times Square. 
[00:06:00]  Taped, some photos, an interview, things like that.  Us playing games.  It's all going to be up on the website.  I'll let you know when.  What's the gist of it?  The gist of it is following us around on one of our many fun-filled little dates that we go on. 
[00:06:30]  Boring.  Hey.  Hey.  Boring.  How is that boring?  I think it's great.  As long as the entire date is followed.  I don't want them to stop.  Oh, you want the whole thing.  Hold it.  I want the entire day videotaped and documented.  Yeah.  Even after we went home.  Is that a picture?  Date crash.  Chantelini busted having fun at Dave & Buster's. 
[00:07:00]  What's the highlight of this video?  Be honest.  The highlight is probably...  Besides two people being in love, doing like a little, I don't know, date to Dave & Buster's.  I think the highlight is probably when she was in the big claw machine, the giant one.  And she was in there.  And then the mechanism actually started moving, and she had to run out of it because it was  chasing her.  Do you have makeup on? 
[00:07:30]  No.  Looks like you have makeup on on the WB11 website.  I guarantee you there is no makeup on.  And they're calling it the...  Wait, what was that other thing?  Oh, here it is.  Antelini date crash.  The one month anniversary.  Well, yeah.  They're documenting your relationship with Jill Nicolini on the WB11 website.  Or is it referring to a Jill's downfall?  Hey.  Can we get audio of this? 
[00:08:00]  It's up there already, so we can at least play the audio.  Oh, she's playing air hockey with you.  She, uh, yeah.  And she just kicked your ass, it looked like.  She's pretty good at the air hockey.  And now you're being interviewed at a bar area.  Of course.  And it looks like you're not even allowing her to breathe.  I mean, can you be any closer to somebody?  I look like, uh, Obama and Michelle having, uh, an interview where I have to just constantly  keep, you know, hey, hey, let me say that.  All right.  We got to get this audio immediately.  It's like a five minute piece on.  Is it already? 
[00:08:30]  On the website.  Put that up fast.  Yeah.  I didn't even think it was up there yet.  That's why I mentioned it.  I wasn't going to mention it.  It ends with her and Anthony getting his and her mullets.  The Long Island staple.  Do you guys, uh, keep anything private or is this like?  Oh yes.  Very private.  Yeah.  We have some very private moments.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The second we leave work.  All right.  Well, we got to get the highlights of that video.  If there, well, of course there are.  If there, sorry, we don't spend our day with you just farting and your girlfriend yelling 
[00:09:00]  at you, sorry, that sounds like a banner day to me.  I actually agree with you.  Oh my God.  And now you're doing like a, like.  We were at Dave and Buster's.  See, we had to see what our children would look like.  So we went into that booth where they take your pictures and then, and then see, and  they have got to be the ugliest children that ever came out of a machine. 
[00:09:30]  You guys would probably have good looking kids.  They were heinous.  I think I negate all of her attractive genes.  Wow.  That's what your kid would look like, huh?  Oh, geez.  Just put them in special class.  Very.  Window licker.  Very, uh, tossable, this kid.  Oh God.  It's horrible.  How old was he?  40 in that picture?  I know.  He had like a, the toupee on or something.  They had Herb Tarlick.  You're in the ball pit.  You're surrounded by like stuffed animals. 
[00:10:00]  It's the giant claw machine.  It's giant.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, we went in there and, uh, then, you know, the mechanism started moving.  Get me this audio.  Very dangerous.  Immediately.  We'll have this after the break.  We just got to cut it up a little bit.  You know, you put your, you know, you pick up prizes with the claw and you have to drop  it in the little thing and then you win the prize.  But this was like giant stuff with a huge claw.  So you're supposed to be, are you supposed to be in there?  No, you're not supposed to be in there.  No, that's the gag. 
[00:10:30]  It's like, oh, you get to be in the giant claw machine.  Yeah, we were special.  Oh, no one's allowed in there.  Just you guys.  No one.  Oh, I thought it was kind of a new thing they were doing.  Oh no.  There are also 45 new photos of the date.  45?  Oh, we haven't even looked at the last two to three hundred yet.  You guys got to slow down with the picture taken so a lot of people could catch up.  And now we're winging off to the Bahamas, so there'll be more pictures.  We sure like pictures. 
[00:11:00]  This is known as a whirlwind romance.  Yes, that's what I call it.  Whirlwind.  We're jet setting.  Married by the end of the year, my friend.  Oh, now you know my views.  Married by, yeah.  Why don't you yell and scream about marriage and kids right now?  Go ahead.  What?  Let's see if you can.  I will.  Marriage is a horrible institution. 
[00:11:30]  Horrid.  There's nothing in it for the guy.  And nothing but liability in it for the guy.  And I'm still paying through the nose.  So, no.  And what about kids?  Not getting married.  Kids are little atrocities put upon us to keep us from doing spontaneous things,  like running off to the Bahamas at a moment's notice.  What if Jill wants to have a kid?  Oh, then fine.  Yeah, then I'll have kids.  What are you talking about?  Just for Anthony. 
[00:12:00]  It's Anthony's favorite song out there right now, and Kenny sang it for him.  No.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony's top song of the day.  Brad Paisley.  I'm still a guy.  When you see a deer, you see Bambi, and I see antlers up on the wall.  When you see a lake, you think picnics, and I see a large mouth up on that log. 
[00:12:30]  You're probably thinking that you're going to change me in some ways.  Well, maybe you might scrub me down, dress me up.  Oh, but no matter what, remember, I'm still a guy.  All right, we're off to a fine start.  We're going to get the audio of this video you guys made.  The Anthony video will be on the show in a few minutes here.  But first, this is a huge surprise. 
[00:13:00]  Very busy show, and it just got busier.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Maria's kind of pissed off from Hoboken.  Maria.  What?  Maria.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  You know, I love the whole Anthony bit,  but this thing is just, it's turned into just a big publicity stunt, you know.  I'm not so sure I'm buying it anymore.  Really?  What?  I mean, Dave and Buster's on a date.  I know. 
[00:13:30]  Is there something I've better to do?  We've been on plenty of other dates that have been other places.  Are you actually getting any?  Am I actually getting any?  Oh, damn, no, you didn't.  All right, but you know, Maria.  Maybe, maybe I should invite you over so you can take a look.  How about you invite one of us so we can report to Maria?  Yeah, we'll be the Opie and Anthony reporter.  That would be something for the website.  What do you say, Maria? 
[00:14:00]  I said, that would be something for the website.  That would be something for the website.  Oh, well, yeah.  Well, not that website.  I'd make my own and make money off of it, for God's sake.  Come on.  You know, I wanted to laugh.  You guys are my heroes.  I love this.  It's just unbelievable at this point, though.  You don't believe it's a real relationship.  They are winging on down to the Bahamas, though, today.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  But you could go there for a divorce.  People don't have to like each other.  People don't have to like each other.  Hey, she's kind of right.  She makes a good point.  There have been places, yeah.  I've gone with people I hate.  So what do you say, Anthony?  There's some critics out there saying this is a big publicity stunt.  It's not a bit.  Please.  All right.  We've tried to tell the folks out there.  We saw it with our own eyes, right, Jimmy?  Yes, we did.  I'd love to, you know, get into the graphic details of how it's not a bit. 
[00:15:00]  But, you know, I'm kind of a private person when it comes to that.  But, boy, it sure wasn't a bit.  Could you say words that rhyme with it?  Just think whatever you want, Jimmy, and, you know, you're probably right.  So this is what we got.  Day 31 of Anthelini.  I think we're up to 32.  Yeah.  Bahama wedding, question mark.  That's the latest rumor.  Wow. 
[00:15:30]  And then 136 days until the presidential election, just in case you.  Well, I'm keeping count on that, too, of course.  Keeping track of that.  All right.  Do we have time to do it?  Should we take a break?  Because I don't know if we have time.  Will he be there?  Can he stay?  This show just got a lot busier.  Tom.  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Will you be able to hold through a quick commercial break?  Yes, I can.  You sure?  We got your number just in case?  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  No.  If we come back from commercial and you're not there, they're going to crucify me.  Oh, they'll kill us.  They're going to kill me, Tom.  I'll be here.  All right.  Cool.  There's Tom from Is Tom Alive?  Who tried to kill himself on our show a mere week, a little over a week ago, and then  they dragged him into a hospital.  He has finally left the hospital.  We are going to get an update from Tom right after the break.  I guarantee that.  Okay?  Right.  Also, let's not forget, Mike Myers in a little over an hour, Stephen Lynch stopping by, Big 
[00:16:30]  A, Tippy Tom, our homeless friend, Dr. Steve, and Brie Olson.  Brie was in once, right?  Yeah.  She's sexy.  She's sexy.  She's very, very sexy.  A porn star coming by.  It's nice.  We're finally getting porn stars back on our show.  Finally.  I think corporate finally had enough with all the gay crap we've been doing on the show.  I said, all right, all right, all right.  You're allowed to have women on the show again.  877-212-018.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Got to get right back into this.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:17:00]  So, Tom from White Plains, a friend of the show, started calling us about a year ago.  Actually, more than a year ago.  He has this horrible disease that is slowly but surely taking his life, turning his lungs  into cement, way, way back.  He told us when it gets really bad or too bad, he's going to take his own life.  He'd rather go out that way instead of continuing to suffer.  So, last week he decided that the day has come. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  Calls us up out of nowhere.  We had no idea that he was going to try to kill himself.  We thought it was just another phone call from Tom, like many, many others we have taken  over the last year or so.  He had guns loaded in front of him.  More than one.  It was pretty intense.  Jimmy did an amazing job talking to Tom.  We talked him down.  And then Anthony was telling Tom to unload his guns. 
[00:18:00]  And as he was unloading his guns, a gun went off.  I don't know, around, kind of left in the chamber.  And went through a wall or hit a wall or what have you.  I think he has a basement apartment now, so I think it hit like cement.  And then, of course, when you unload a gun, well, the authorities get involved.  I heard, we'll find out in a second here, that a SWAT team was called.  And they dragged Tom out of his house, his apartment, and brought him to a hospital. 
[00:18:30]  That was eight or nine days ago.  And for the first time since then, we got Tom on the show.  Tom.  Hi.  How are you, sir?  Hey, Tom.  How you guys doing?  Well, good.  We want to know how you're doing, my friend.  I'm doing much better.  Yeah?  Much better.  Yes, yes, yeah.  Now, kind of walk us through what happened after, you know, you weren't on the air with us anymore.  Well, my sister was listening to the radio show live. 
[00:19:00]  So the first phone call I got after hanging up was her.  Mm-hmm.  Then, you know, off air I spoke with Travis, and he gave me a, he gave me a, he asked for  my number to give to Dr. Steve.  Right.  Yeah, because we have a doctor that does a lot of good stuff for the radio show, and we were 
[00:19:30]  hoping that maybe he could do something for you.  And he called, he, he called back, I spoke with him for about 15 minutes, and, you know,  he said he's going to do some research and get back to me, and, which I found his first  email, and unfortunately, there's a deficit in palliative care.  A what? 
[00:20:00]  A what?  We didn't, we didn't understand what you just said, Tom.  A deficit in what?  A deficit in, in, in palliative care.  Okay.  What does that mean?  What does that mean, Tom?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're confused.  It means there's not a lot.  Oh, okay.  Of people to take care of, people with multiple illnesses.  Oh, I see.  Oh, okay.  And, well, you know, I made some phone calls. 
[00:20:30]  I made some of, actually, Jimmy and Anthony, all you guys did a great job talking to me.  Uh, and, uh, so, I called to make some appointments that I need to be, have to be done.  And, uh, you know, I'm sitting in my, uh, office area, and, uh, you know, somebody's 
[00:21:00]  ringing the doorbell, pounding the door, and I'm like, you know, I'm not expecting anybody.  Jesus.  And, uh, and, you know, it's been about two and a half hours, you know, after the show,  after your XM show, uh, and, uh, well, you know, they were all sneaking up and around getting 
[00:21:30]  rid of all the neighbors.  Oh, gee.  They cleared out the neighborhood just in case any errant, uh, shots might go through  some walls, and...  The local, the local, the local news, the local news came, uh, you know, News 12 here  in Westchester.  Mm-hmm.  News 12 in the metropolitan area.  You mean, you mean the college news came by?  Yeah.  Or the local university?  That's pretty much the same thing.  How did they know to come by, though? 
[00:22:00]  If the cops are doing a thing, how did they know to, how did the news notice show up?  Uh, the scanner.  Yeah, they just listened to the scanner all day long.  Okay.  All right.  And, uh, so, so, uh, you know, because of the pounding and the, uh, and the, uh, and  the, uh, and the ringing of the doorbell, you know, I thought it was like my landlord is  91 now, uh, and I thought it was like the upstairs neighbor, you know, found her in the driveway 
[00:22:30]  when she was bending over to pick up the newspaper.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, so, you know, I, so, I just ran to the door in socks, uh, underwear, uh.  Oh, not a good way to confront the police.  Uh, and, uh, and a t-shirt, uh, a ratty old t-shirt at that.  Uh, and I opened the door, uh, and the screen door's already open, and there's a bunch of 
[00:23:00]  shields, and two AR-15s pointed at my head.  I was like, uh, they're like, are you Tom?  And I'm like, yeah.  Well, at that point, I would go, no, I'm not Tom.  I, I, I, yeah, I probably would have been, yeah, I'd put it in shot anyway.  Uh, I'd put my hands up just instinctively, and they're like, step out. 
[00:23:30]  It's a good instinct.  And I'm like, no, I, no, I wanted, I need to go get some shoes.  Mm.  You know, and shorts.  And they wouldn't let me back in.  No, they're never really good with letting you get dressed after you've shot guns.  And, uh, they, uh, they, uh, you know, they cuffed me and detained me, uh, in a police  car, uh, and just in my underwear and t-shirt and socks, and, uh, that's how they took me 
[00:24:00]  to the hospital.  Mm.  Fortunately, they grabbed my shorts, which had my wallet and keys in it, and, uh, it was  not a very pleasant situation, uh, it was six days in there, six days.  Six days in the hospital.  Yeah.  But it, it seemed like a year.  Was it against your will, or they, what happened?  It had to be the loony bin, right, Tom?  Oh, yeah, it was a psych ward, and, uh, at first it was against my will, but I signed over 
[00:24:30]  the voluntary, uh, because, uh, actually, uh, it gives me more rights, uh, and, uh, you  know, uh, and then I was...  Oh, it's what, it's time as opposed to being committed, you mean?  Like, for them to commit you?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You know, there's, you know, I went there involuntarily, uh, but once I got there, I signed the statement 
[00:25:00]  voluntary, because I get more legal rights.  Sure.  So what kind of mental drugs did they put you on that makes you, uh, talk like Johnny Carson?  Ah.  Ah.  Yeah.  Actually, Dave from New Hampshire, he's waiting to get on the air, he says, for someone who  says he can't breathe, he sure is long-winded when he talks.  Oh, God.  People are saying your story's making them want to commit suicide.  Uh.  Well, how long... 
[00:25:30]  Well, you...  Hold on, now, you were in there for six days.  What'd they do?  Uh, they just, uh, made sure that, you know, I actually ran out of my antidepressant, uh,  so, the, uh, and I just got it back the week before, when I got a new doctor, uh, and wrote  the script, so it didn't have actually time to bring up to a therapeutic level.  Okay.  And, uh, and, uh, the, uh, you know, they just waited until, uh, the, you know, it was a therapeutic 
[00:26:00]  dose in me.  So, it kicked in, and, uh, you weren't as depressed?  Uh, did, did, did the, uh, the law officers take your, uh, weapons?  Uh, they confiscated what I gave them.  All right.  I think I understand. 
[00:26:30]  Do you have, uh, gun charges now?  No.  No, no.  I'm licensed to carry.  Jesus.  And that was just considered, what, an accidental discharge?  Uh, uh, no, no, no.  They just let them go slide.  Okay.  Uh, uh, as just yet, they haven't given me any charges, but if they haven't applied them,  uh, well, they do have 120 days, but, uh, you know, they were more, they were more concerned 
[00:27:00]  than all the medications that were on my desk.  Oh, really?  Uh, night's dead.  Yeah.  Uh, and that wasn't even the half of them, you know, the controlled substances were in  the safe with the, uh, well, uh...  Oh, God.  We're in the safe.  Right.  Now, Tom, a lot of people want to know, how close were you really to killing yourself 
[00:27:30]  when you called us last week?  Uh, pretty close.  But I'm going to tell you, uh, you guys, uh, always have a way of cheering me up.  Uh, and the way, uh, both, uh, both, uh, Jimmy was fantastic.  Oh, thanks.  Uh, uh, and, and, uh, you know, usually you can very be sharp-witted and, uh, you know, 
[00:28:00]  make fun of things, which, you know, I heard afterwards, but, you know, that's all part  of it.  Well, Tom, what was, what was said that got to you and said, okay, I can handle this,  I'm not going to do this?  Was there one thing that, uh, Jimmy said where you went, you know what, I could, I could,  I could live another day.  Actually, it was something Anthony said.  Oh, wow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, breaking news.  Seems, uh, well, that's not, that's not what the newspaper said, but, okay. 
[00:28:30]  What did Anthony say?  Because Anthony has a lot of wisdom.  No, it wasn't, it was what he said.  It's the fact that he can go out again, uh, means I can actually live.  Uh.  What?  What, what did Anthony say?  it wasn't more than what he said  it's the fact that  you know  he went on living his life  Anthony?  yeah  you know 
[00:29:00]  with Antolini  are you telling me  Tom wait please  look at the scene  now this is breaking news  Antolini was your inspiration to live  of course it was  yes  that's just the opposite effect  I'm being open  can we have your guns Tom  that is fantastic  I love it  at this point I think we can use one or two  oh Tom you're an inspiration to us all 
[00:29:30]  are you saying that Antolini saved your life  well  that was a part of it  I mean it was a whole combination of things  but Anthony goes  you know people have been through a lot  a lot you know  a lot worse  right  and  and you know  I just remembered  his glorious marriage  yeah see  and the fact that  you know 
[00:30:00]  here he is  you know  getting pretty serious  with a woman again  and not just  look at the inspiration  we're saving lives  that newspaper  I gotta tell you  got everything wrong  they did not  they did  even Tom is saying they did  the paper's never wrong  here's what happened to Tom  he was gonna do it  he was very depressed  talking to us was fine  he got a picture of Jill  in a low cut shirt  and he said  that's worth living for  that's what happened  it wasn't you  it was her 
[00:30:30]  it was her  in a low cut shirt  her bosom  of course  Tom is basically saying  you can turn your life around  as miserable as you are  it could always get better  like it did for Anthony  right Tom  am I summarizing  yes  that's great  well how are you feeling Tom  I  what's that  how are you man  how are you feeling  you sound better  better  yeah  you know  I was in air conditioning  for a week  I was for many years  oh the business  I thought you meant  the business 
[00:31:00]  yeah that's pretty  that's pretty cruel  in your state  that they made you  go into you know  air conditioning  for a week  wait do you don't  what are you  you're crawling around  in hot attics  and stuff  this time of year  in your condition Tom  are you doing  duct work  for the hospital  what's going on  you don't have  air conditioning  in your house  no I do  I do  I turned it on  I turned it on  the  you know  not the first day  of the heat wave  because 
[00:31:30]  I'm on the ground floor  there's a sub  basement below me  but I'm above ground  but it's all concrete  yeah  so  locked behind  the sheet rock  and insulation  yeah  made a nice little  bong  sure  wait does he have  air conditioning  no  yeah he says  he does  yes I do  but I guess  the air conditioning  in the hospital  was much better  it was  it was on ice  icicles  oh nice  it was nice and cold  now Tom  what's your prognosis  what are they telling you  did they tell you  anything at the hospital 
[00:32:00]  did Dr. Steve  give you any hope  where are we at  I took the doctors  48 hours  to get my pain  medications up  so the first two days  was just miserable  hmm  and  let's see  a  little putty  patched the hole  a little putty  patched the hole  okay  from the gun  going off  a little putty 
[00:32:30]  yeah  you know  actually  the police  left my place  a mess  everything was  tossed off  all around  they  they covered  the hole  themselves  so they couldn't  find it  by tossing stuff  in front of it  so they couldn't  tell if I  discharged the gun  or not  cuts down on the  paperwork  wow  man  well there's your  update Tom  you sound really 
[00:33:00]  good  yeah you sound  much better  you sound better  than you have  in quite a long  time  well yeah  hey Tom  do you go to  therapy or anything  sorry to interrupt you  man  do you go to  therapy  well I'm  supposed to now  yeah you should  man it helps  uh yeah  actually I did  years ago  I used to go  to a pain  management group  uh but I  don't want to  go into that  uh but uh  yeah  there's a  discharge  order 
[00:33:30]  uh as  opposed to  uh see  a psychiatrist  and a  therapist  but uh  I was looking  for one  anyway  but you know  everyone I  called  was uh  I'm not  seeing patients  now  yeah  oh that's  nice  so Tom  you're not  gonna kill  yourself anytime  soon right  people need  to know that  no  no  no  no  I'm not  planning on it  and you got a lot  of uh  lot of people out  there concerned  about you  the websites 
[00:34:00]  have been talking  about you like  crazy lately  and I think  they're trying to  figure out what  they can do  for you  the uh  that's very  very nice  actually what  really touched  me is when I  was in the  hospital  my landlord  called up  she's 91  years old  you know  I found out  the hospital's  the pay phone  number because  they don't let  you call the  desk and get  it to  uh  and uh  you know  just to see  how I was  doing  uh  that's nice  of her 
[00:34:30]  you know  it was just  like I said  when I came  home yesterday  she like  took me up  to her apartment  and was like  oh I'm so  happy you're  home  I was so  worried  and you know  that's kind of  touching for a  landlord to be  that way  do you kind of  when you feel  like you feel  that depressed  do you kind of  in one way  like you're  really depressed  and we felt  you were sincere  and is there  a part of you  that's kind of  just you  you want to  kind of know  that people  care about you  like sometimes  you just kind  of want to  be around  like you  you kind  of call  it because  you want  to know  that your  friends are  somehow  concerned 
[00:35:00]  with you  on some  level  I'm not even  thinking about  that  you know  actually it was  afterwards  where people  were like  you know  look you really  hurt me  you know  why didn't you  call me  why didn't you  call me  and stuff  you know  that's what I  got  for most people  you didn't  call me  Tony  you didn't  call me

[00:45:00]  it's called  ripoffs or coincidences  in music  mmm  I like these  and I thought this would be a throwaway  but then I listened to a couple samples  and it's unbelievable  it really is unbelievable  blatant  yeah for example  Chuck Berry did a song called  Sweet Little 16  mmhmm  little piece  they're really rockin' in Boston  and Pittsburgh, PA  deep in the heart of Texas  there you go 
[00:45:30]  a little taste of Chuck Berry  doing Sweet Little 16  right?  sure  uh  does this sound familiar  yeah well  it's the same effin' song  different lyrics  beach boys  surf USA  yeah 
[00:46:00]  yeah  it's a tolerable song  not a big beach boys fan  a bunch of fruity sand kickers  teehee  surf sub  shut up  oh sand kickers  okay  yes  I thought you meant  they were from another nation  no no no  alright  um  yeah that is kinda close  kinda close  well black people hate us  I thought we'd have to really  focus and concentrate  that one was right on  yeah  apparently that's  I didn't realize  but apparently that's one  that's one of the more  well documented ones 
[00:46:30]  and apparently now  uh  the beach boys pay me royalties  to  well they have to  yeah they have to  oh really  cause they originally claimed  all the writing credits  and now they actually have to give  uh  what's his face  a writing credit  Chuck Berry  Chuck Berry  what about Marvin Berry  well yeah we were making those jokes all day  I missed that  you wanna hear another one  you know  uh  Marty McFly  ought to get a writing credit  for uh  Chuck Berry  because his cousin Marvin  uh  Berry  uh 
[00:47:00]  turned him on to um  Marty's playing  at the uh  Enchantment Under the Sea dance  oh  you're obsessed  just Danny is laughing  that's it  yeah  of course  it rules  you want another one  sure  okay  Brian Adams  Summer of 69  Jimmy quit  Jody got married  I should've known  we never get far  oh let me look back now  that summer seems to last forever 
[00:47:30]  and if I had a choice  yeah  I'll be there  I like Brian Adams  remember that song  and Anthony had a great comment  when he was listening to this  during the break  but here is  Green Day  wow yeah okay 
[00:48:00]  that's pretty close  that's pretty close  and you said  during the break  you thought it was  Brian Adams  Summer of 69  in a different language  yeah I thought  it was like  some German band  doing Summer of 69  a remake  Green Day  shows up on this 
[00:48:30]  a lot  they seem to be  repeat offenders  I mean who knows though  could be just coincidence  yeah  them blatantly ripping it off  I don't know  I know that from my experience  you know  trying to have bands  and playing with other people  you write a song  and then two weeks later  you realize  oh man that sounds exactly like  and then  you just drop it  but I guess some people  just don't drop it  if it happens multiple times  especially a song  that's bigger  Summer of 69  that's all over the radio  you probably just heard it  and just took it  I don't know  that's pretty obvious though  yeah  Danny give me  you want another real good one  yeah give me a really good one 
[00:49:00]  before we move on  we got tons of them  but we'll do a little here  and then we'll do a little later  the next two tracks are identical  and if you want to do 7 and 8  that's Paris Hilton  Stars Are Blind  who stole from her?  no one stole from her  this is UB40 Kingston Town  soon I'll be on a beach  listening to this stuff  you will be  a man of daiquiri 
[00:49:30]  lingers on  lingers  there you go  you got the  UB40  and then remember  when everyone's like  oh Paris Hilton  she's the next big pop star  yeah  listen to this  yeah wow  wow  wow  this thing  UB40  wow that is  the same epic song

[00:51:30]  God, like thieves  I don't know how  I don't know how you just  You blatantly get away with things like that  I wonder if that's the artist or if the  It seems to always be the music  Is it the producers, the musical  Yeah, it's gotta be the writer  I mean, I doubt she's coming up with her own stuff these days  I'm sure that's her writing team  Or whoever it is  They figure, we'll try to get away with this  If we don't, well, we throw a little money their way  F-U-H-Q  I'm not gonna say his name 
[00:52:00]  Is saying  They both sound like  What, what in the butt  One more, Ray Parker Jr.  Well, yeah, this one got a lot of  I didn't know at the time  Of course  Remember Ghostbusters?  Oh, who doesn't?  Oh, look at that  Just make you smile here in this  Yeah, this was a very famous lawsuit 
[00:52:30]  Remember who ripped them off?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Oh, oh  Well, Stuntbrain knows, of course  Yeah, he knows  Oh  Oh, come on  Huey's a genius  Is he?  Well  It was the other way around  Oh, okay  Oh, wait  Yeah, I know  I messed up on the track list, I think  But it was actually  It was actually Ray Parker Jr.  Who had stolen from Huey Lewis 
[00:53:00]  They were only a year apart  Yeah, and that was actually settled out of court  And now  Huey Lewis actually gets residuals from Ghostbusters  From Ghostbusters  Nice  Ghostbusters  I guess you're right, Anthony  Huey Lewis is a genius  Huey's a genius  There you go  We got  There's so much  Dude, there's so much  We got a few more  We got some Zeppelin  Back in Time song that he does  He's in a little movie  I can't remember the name  Huey gets everything  Ray lost all of his royalties?  I don't know  Oh, God 
[00:53:30]  Why do you rock?

No, actually it was  Stairway ripped off?  Yeah  Come on  Apparently, well the story goes  That Zeppelin toured with this band  When they weren't 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, Spirit  When they weren't so huge  And just pretty much  Lifted the opening riff  From Stairway to Heaven  Oh, there's a song  Boy, in hindsight  That must have been like  Oh, maybe we shouldn't have picked  The biggest song ever written  It's been acknowledged  And apparently  The original band is cool with it  And I think he actually  I think Jimmy Page  Actually asked permission  If he could  Like play with their riff  Oh, really?  What?  Stairway to Heaven  Is the greatest song of all time  And it was ripped off by Spirit?  No, no 
[00:54:30]  They ripped it off by Spirit?  Spirit apparently  Spirit had a song called  Taurus back in 1968  Oh, jeez  Are you kidding?  These poor bastards  Wow  Hey, could I have the riff?  That's a good one  Yeah, okay  Take it  Let's make the most popular song  Ever written  They just missed with this one  It was Elevator to Purgatory  Oh, my God 
[00:55:00]  How bad do you feel for Spirit right now?  What was their one hit?  They had  It was  I don't even know  Nature's Way  Off the 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus album  God damn stunt brain  You're unbelievable  He's on fire  I love that  I actually wish he was on fire  Yeah  Literally  And then, of course  It's not  Wow  Wow  That's how I ended up finding all of these 
[00:55:30]  Because there was a video  That was making the rounds  It was just a whole bunch of Zeppelin  Stuff that Zeppelin had either ripped off  Or borrowed  Or, you know, covered  Yeah  And it just led me to all these other  All these other plagiarized songs  Well, Led Zeppelin had fun with the black man  That's for sure  Oh, man  They had a lot of fun with the black man  They just took every blues  Every genius blues song from the 50s  Yeah  And just kind of, you know  Made it a little more rockin'  And based their entire career off of it  How many Zeppelin ones you got? 
[00:56:00]  Well, not on that  But I could get more  Oh, I'd love to hear more Zeppelin ones  Yeah, hey  Is there another good one on there?  I want to move on  Well, you know what  The reason that this  I decided to compile all these  Because Coldplay was just in the news yesterday  For claiming  This other band was claiming  That Coldplay ripped off their new single  Which is huge  And it's like the theme for iTunes  Or iTunes these days  Viva La Vida  It's bigger than anything  Yeah, this is the new Coldplay song  A little taste  Viva La Vida  Sounds like someone wants to be Bono 
[00:56:30]  It's a good song  I don't even like stuff like that  And like, you know  After hearing that commercial a few times  I'm like, god damn it  I like Coldplay  I gotta be honest  What does it rip off?  Well, the band that is claiming  That they were ripped off  Is if you go to the last track  28? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah  What is that?  A band called Creaky Boards  Creaky Boards  This was on Drudge Report all day yesterday  And they were claiming that  They did a show last year  And Chris Martin was there  Just observing  And like digging their song  That's what they claim  Who knows if it's true  But whatever  But this is their song  I would understand  If it was the who or something  But you think Chris Martin  Has time to go search out  Creaky Boards songs  Here's Creaky Boards  And a song they did  Called The Songs I Didn't Write  Ironically  A year ago  When you have gone to bed 
[00:57:30]  And I am all alone inside my head  I turn on the stereo  The one only I can know  It's pretty close  It would have made me cry  But what would have fallen from your eyes  Same thing  Yeah, it was close  And I was like  Maybe they're just trying  To get some publicity out of this  But then that led me  To this Joe Satriani track 
[00:58:00]  Which is even closer  Than that track  Oh  Oh really?  So yeah  Maybe he's ripping off Joe Satriani  Wow  Alright  Wow  That is  And the way that I had found this one  The guy actually layered  The guitar riff  Over Coldplay's song  And it fits  This tempo  Perfectly  Perfect  Everything is perfect  Refresh your memory  And then you got Coldplay  With the brand new song 
[00:58:30]  I used to rule the world  The seas would rise when I came to work  Yeah  Now in the morning I sleep alone  Sweep the streets I used to roam  Oh wow  It's tough man  I mean it's hard for me to imagine Chris Martin  Sitting there in his basement  With old Joe Satriani records  Just going  Yeah I gotta steal this 
[00:59:00]  But it sounds so  That's too close  That's very close  I want to get more Zeppelin  Definitely  Yeah I'll get some more for you  Yeah we go  You know who's one of the biggest defenders ever?  The Offspring  Really?  Yeah there are so many songs  Like one song they do  Sounds just like Lady Madonna  I'll try to remember the song  Yeah that was  Yeah that's right  That's right  Obladi Oblada  What song?  What song?  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Yeah yeah  Maybe Iraq can find it  Oh my god 
[00:59:30]  I'm depending on Iraq  Holy Jesus  Oh my god  Get a job  All right yeah  Okay  Get a little bit of it  Think Obladi when you hear that  Yeah  Give me a taste there Iraq  Why would you rip off such a well-known riff?  Yeah  Really does  It's not showing up  Oh it is showing up  It's in there  I know it is  You're misspelling it  I don't think it's called to get a job  That's the problem  I'll find it  I'll find it  Cream Pie Jones is in here helping 
[01:00:00]  Oh we're gonna talk to Cream Pie Jones  CPJ  CPJ  In the house  Having a nervous breakdown  Because the porn star  Was trying to do some things to him  Stop pretending you don't hear a stupid  Hey Cream Pie  This might be a little too inside  But hey Cream Pie  You know what day it is today?  It's Friday  Oh  What does that mean?  What did I miss?  Let's check  Oh  All right  All right  We gotta take a break  You can't find it that fast?  It's not in here 
[01:00:30]  It's gotta be  I think it's called something else  Oh  Huh?  Oh you got it?  Yeah  Obladiobladiobladi  Let's see  My friend's got a girlfriend  Man he hates that bitch  Wait till it kicks in  He tells me every day  He says man I really gotta lose my chick  In the worst kind of way  She sits on her ass  He works his hands to the bone 
[01:01:00]  To give her money every payday  But she wants  It really is  Yeah  Everyone  I want me  Oh what that  Whoa  Man I know  Why don't you get a job  Say no way  Say no way  Yeah  No way  Hey  Man I know  Why don't you get a job 
[01:01:30]  I can't say  It really is  I wasn't feeling that one at first  Yeah yeah  You can definitely hear it in there  All right  We gotta take a quick break  We gotta like  Get set for Michael Myers  Stopping by  Mike Myers in studio  At 745  And we want to squeeze this  Anthelini date crash  From cw11.com  On the radio  Before that  So quick break  We'll continue  Opie and Anthony  I knew that would happen eventually  Wow 
[01:02:00]  I went to reach for something  And my thumb hit one of the sound effects  During the middle of your read  Yeah  I'm just glad it wasn't one of those  That get us in trouble  Yeah but it was a bad one  Because I was talking about  This great car dealership  All-American Ford  Here in New York  Yeah  And you hit a button by accident  And the button said  Don't do it  Oh it was it  It was this  Don't do it  Is that why  I don't want to laugh  That was it  Well no  Do it  I'm sure  Go down  To All-American Ford  I'm sure we'll be hearing  From All-American Ford 
[01:02:30]  Later today  It was an accidental discharge  Of the sound effect machine  Yeah  By the way  I got a little side project  Going on  Do you  Yeah  Drug dealer  No no  You're listening to it right now  I'm in a band  And I came up with this cool riff right here  I'm just  Oh  I'm just working on the words right now  Oh this is yours  Yeah it is  Wow that's a  That's like a catchy riff  Thank you  Thank you  I just need some words  I'm still like writing it out  Trying to figure it out as I go  Like maybe something about Michael J. Fox 
[01:03:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show  I just ran into the green room  Mike Myers is going to be here any second  Yeah  Wow  What he requested today  There's a lot of stuff in there  It made the paper today  There was a Conan O'Brien thing  What was that stunt brain  Stunt brain knows everything  What?  Just ask him  Mike Myers wants his demands met 
[01:03:30]  The comic made an appearance on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien  Wednesday to promote The Love Guru  But he drove backstage staffers bonkers while he waited to go on  Bonkers?  He sent a team of interns on a wild goose chase for silk non-dairy creamer  Twizzlers and raspberry seltzer  Said our witness  Then he sent one of the interns back out to get him a new drink  When he realized his seltzer was not the brand he requested  What are they crazy?  Why didn't they get him the brand he requested?  Let it be known  The staff of the O.P. and Anthony show 
[01:04:00]  Much better than the staff at the Conan O'Brien show  Of course  Because we met his demands  And they're in the green room waiting for Mr. Myers to show up  I certainly hope we get 100 on our test  We better  Our rider test  I ran in there and took a picture  It's going to be up on onaradio.com  Oh, he also requested no photos of the stuff on his rider  Well, you better get that picture up there immediately  It's unbelievable  We got a lot of food to eat after Mike Myers leaves  I think what happens is  He probably likes to have a couple of things 
[01:04:30]  Like, you know, you go out, you do an interview  You want to eat a couple of snacks or something small  And then what happens is the people around him start going  I'd like this  They just start throwing in  Oh, so you think it's just for his support staff  Yeah, we like 40 bags of Twizzlers and 3 truck tires  And we need a DVD player  Where'd you get that idea from, Jimmy?  We've done a tour, too  It's funny, because Mike and I are men of similar ilk  I have a rider as well  Oh, do you?  Do you, yeah  Yeah, and it's usually some filthy deli tray 
[01:05:00]  Yeah  I'm like, why is this rotting meat here in the dressing room?  And Kenny's like, it's on your rider  I'm like, take it off  Yeah, it's the meat underneath the plastic wrap  And it's got, like, sweat on it  Yeah  It's beating up with moisture  The ham has, like, a rainbow hue to it  It's been sitting out too long  I've got to call out Pete Pappalardo  He does a great job with the Virus Tour every summer  When we get our comedian friends together  And we do a little thing  Going to do one, what, at the PNC August 2nd?  August 2nd, yeah  He puts on a great show 
[01:05:30]  He really organizes the hell out of the thing  But he sucks at catering  He sucks  I was going for the joke  I was just like  We're just looking like, yeah, you know  That's right  We're all reviewing the catering  The catering at  I don't know who books the venue catering  Like, because, you know, they all have  Every event has them  So they might be venue brought in caterers  I don't know how that works 
[01:06:00]  Could that possibly be more wishy-washy?  Well, let's be honest  Yeah, that didn't go anywhere  So why don't we move on?  Pete, I love you  Exactly  And take olive loaf off my rider  Yeah  Four pounds of olive loaf  And one slice of bread  I want to squeeze this in  Because we're going to have to take another break  Really fast  So we can set up the Mike Myers interview perfectly  Oh, yes  We started the show by talking about Antellini again  And we learned yesterday  That you had a film crew  You and Joel  Yeah, yeah  Went to Dave & Buster's here in New York City

[01:09:30]  Uh  Just you know  So we can hang out  More time to hang out  And I spent about two hours  Cleaning up after my cats  Because right now I have  Five  I have two little babies  Right  So there's five of them  So I had to come home  Clean litter  Clean everything  And clean the whole house  That was it  I also spent time  Taking cat hair off stuff  That's uh  That's uh  That's uh  Five cats  Boo  Oh dear lord  Oh look at the comments

Today?  I was watching a lot of clips from the movie on YouTube last night  And it looks like it's going to be a funny movie  Jeez, I'm sure they love hearing that  Well, what did I tell you? 
[01:16:30]  It is kind of the  I don't know  Kind of the downside of it  If you're into making movies  I don't think the whole movie was up there  But the clips I saw were really, really funny  With that said, Mike Myers entering the studio  Mike  Sure  Or you could sit there  Could sit there  No problem  How are you, Mike?  I'm sleepy  I see that  This is just  It's a ludicrous time to wake up  To do any type of entertainment 
[01:17:00]  Yeah  Sweet tarts and a coffee  And I could do the state bar exam right now  You know what's funny?  Like, we're used to this  So we forget that it's really early in the morning  And then we're reminded when people come in  And they're tired  And they haven't had their coffee yet  Yeah, I was on Saturday Night Live  Right  So you get used to that kind of late night  Yeah  Yeah  Thing  Where you don't really start rolling in  Until four o'clock  Right  And you get there at the crack of noon  You know  That's how people in entertainment should be  You know, not that I'm saying we're in entertainment 
[01:17:30]  We're in radio  We're on the lower rung of entertainment  But it's like  Getting up  It sucks  I hated getting up early when I worked for a living  And I just  I don't like it now  Afternoon drive radio was good  But if you can't be to work by three  You should really be fired  You gotta be used to it for being on sets though  I mean, you get like a six o'clock call  In the morning or something  It just, you know  It just sticks  No, I try and push it later and later  You know, Steve Martin doesn't get in there  Until nine o'clock  And that's what I heard one day 
[01:18:00]  And I went  I like that  Yeah  I'll do that  That sounds good  I must be nice though  You're just gonna put on the New York Island  You know, my team is the Toronto Maple Leafs  I call the New York Islanders a defoliant  And because they wear orange  I call them Agent Orange  Because they take away all the leaves  I just got cold  So I had to put my Islanders jersey on  I haven't worn the Islanders jersey in  I don't know, a couple of years  But I figured for the Mike Myers interview  I'd rub it in a little 
[01:18:30]  Oh, he's a big Islander fan  He's still waiting for his drive for five  Yeah, I certainly am, my friend  I'm a huge hockey fan like yourself  Oh, yeah, I'll pray  Huge  I'm still waiting to win the Stanley Cup  Well, we're waiting to get back there  It's been a while  It's been 20 some odd years at this point  I don't know much about hockey  Did those two teams not like each other?  We had our problems  There was a problem  We had some problems  There was a little bit of an incident  Of, on the same week that  Four Canadian soldiers got killed  In a friendly fire incident  Some Islanders fan booed  The Canadian National Anthem  Yeah  Which was kind of like 
[01:19:00]  Well, that's gonna hurt a fella  Yeah  I was at the Coliseum  And it was a playoff game  Against Toronto  And I'm sitting there  And they're booing the Canadian Anthem  And I'm thinking  Half our team is Canadian  Yeah  You dummies  There's not a lot of Americans in hockey  Why are you booing their national anthem?  You're insulting the Islanders as well  Well, I don't hold a grudge  I can't imagine it was everybody  And, you know, the thing about Americans  And I'm an American now, too  Is that it was pretty self-policed  A lot of Americans got on those dudes 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  Well, it's like soccer fans  I mean, like, they'll yell the most  They're the worst fans in the world  I mean, occasionally  There might be a bullying  At a baseball game  Or a hockey game  But, you know, soccer fans  Will just, you know,  Will throw stuff on the field  Darts  Darts, yeah, they're animals  Darts  I do gotta say  Before we talk about the love guru  One of my favorite hockey players  Of all time is Ty Domi  Ty Domi, number 28  He used to beat the crap  Out of some of the Islanders  And I would be sitting there  At the Coliseum  Like Kieran Amon  And I'm a hardcore Islander fan  But it's just how this guy plays 
[01:20:00]  I can't help myself  He's the type of dude  Who is like  Hey, Mike  You wanna go to dinner?  Yeah  Call me  And I'm like  Are you trying to kill me?  Did I just get invited to dinner?  Or am I in peril?  It's a tough call  And what I also love  About hockey players now  Because of helmets  Because I'm old enough  Where, like, people  Didn't wear helmets  Where it's now, like  Everybody's got, like, perfect hair  And everything's normal  But there's just this little  Circle here  That is completely scar tissue  Yeah 
[01:20:30]  And they have this  Extraorbital ridge  That's just all cuts  And it looks like a Picasso  Yeah, the old  The old  Who was that?  Ron Duguay  That used to skate around  With the locks of hair  And no helmet  The hair being blown  By unseen winds?  Yes  You can't mess with that hair, man  No  I was fortunate  When I was growing up  I caddied for all the Islanders  As they did  Their Stanley Cup runs, man  Clark Gillies  And Billy Smith  And the rest of them 
[01:21:00]  And in between games  They were just drinking  Their faces off  And playing golf  And when they won it  Back in the day  I got a picture  As just a little kid  Next to the Stanley Cup  Well, you know  We had  I had a different experience  When the New York Islanders  Had their dynasty run  I was looking for ways  To hang myself  With electrical cords  But, you know  Tomato, tomato  You know  What can I say?  I was sitting there going  I'm from Toronto  I want my cup now  I want my cup  I'm a good guy  Well, we bring up hockey 
[01:21:30]  Because the Love Guru  Is based around  You know  Some hockey, right?  Some hockey, yes  I mean, you know  It's based on  The Toronto Maple Leafs  Basically having a little  Problem  And they call in you  Well, I remember  The Yankees hired a guru  Which is kind of  One of the things  That happened  They hired a guru  And I thought  What if the Toronto Maple Leafs  Hired a guru?  Yeah  And as Marilyn Monroe  Says in her song  When love goes wrong  Nothing goes right 
[01:22:00]  And I wanted to combine  Two interesting  And seemingly  Unlike subjects  Yeah, exactly  And, you know  It's kind of like  Field of Dreams  You know  Rink of Dreams  You know  If you write it  They will win  You know  The last time  I saw the Stanley Cup  I was four  And, you know  At that point  I was still pooping  In my pants  And I think  The next time  I see the Stanley Cup  In Toronto  I'll be pooping  In my pants  Either from excitement  Or incontinence  It'll be a 
[01:22:30]  Depends moment  Who is the guru  Based on  Did you grab  Any people from history  Well, there was  The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  The guy who came over  In the 60s  And helped  All these different  Celebrities  Come to  The Beatles  The Beatles  And stuff  A little bit of  Deepak Chopra  After my dad died  I  You know  I love my dad  He's a big sports fan  He was funny  He was a tough  Liverpool guy  If you stepped out of line 
[01:23:00]  Not only would you  You know  Get cut down verbally  But you could  You could expect  To get a nice cuff  On the back of the head  Good Liverpool Irish  Background  So, you know  I was devastated  To be honest with you  And  The good news is  Is that my dad  Would never want me  To be bummed out  He figured that  To be enlightened  Is to lighten up  And he was super  Super funny  So this movie's  Kind of a tribute to him  That's cool  Just to  He died in  1991 
[01:23:30]  He died in 91  Of Alzheimer's  Yeah, it was a pretty  Brutal way to go  Horrible  And he never saw  Your success, right?  Not one bit of it  I think he's singing it  Up in heaven  But he's  You got something  In common  You got something  In common with Anthony  Yeah, because I'm  As successful as Mike  You know what  I mean  We've done pretty well  In the radio world  And Anthony  Hit in radio  Right after his dad died  Yeah, I was in construction  I was just doing  Construction work  And got into radio  And it was like  Three months after 
[01:24:00]  My dad died  I got into radio  So I was like  Oh, this is great  So his last memory  Is Anthony and Addicts  Putting in  Traditioners  I was like in 95  So  Well, the irony of my dad  Is that  Nobody would have found  His Alzheimer's  More funny than my father  Really?  Oh my god, really?  He got Alzheimer's  He just kept  I got Alzheimer's disease  He was like  Making jokes  I'm going  You're making jokes  You're losing your mind  You're dying  What are you doing?  But that's the Liverpool way, man  You can't  Yeah  Everything's a joke  There's some tough people 
[01:24:30]  From Liverpool, it seems  They're the toughest people  They own nothing  Except their own bodies  Yeah  Yeah  It's  There's a lot of  A lot of public sex  And  Everybody knows how to play  The guitar  It's the weirdest thing  If you take the bus  In Liverpool  From downtown  To the suburbs  Where my relatives live  You will see  It's the pool of life  You know, you'll see  Every possible act  Somebody taking a poop  Somebody engaged in things 
[01:25:00]  They shouldn't be  And dudes just telling jokes  And they're hilarious  And there's a lot of drinking  Yeah  You can skate home  In people's vomit  On a Friday  It's actually on the brochures  Yeah  The city of Liverpool  Have decided that that's a virtue  You know  But you can't fix feature  You know  It's the gastric tour  That's what they call it  So were you like  First generation Canadian born  Or were you born over there?  No, I was born  I was born in Canada  But I'm the only 
[01:25:30]  Me and my brother  Is the only people  In my whole gene pool  That aren't from Liverpool  Yeah  And aren't incarcerated  It's the car theft capital of Europe  Having said that  My relatives are awesome  And they're all law-abiding  And they all work in the railways  And they work as postmen  And stuff like that  They're good people  Is it true when you were growing up  You weren't the funniest in your family?  That doesn't sound possible  My dad was hilarious 
[01:26:00]  My mom's super eccentric  My brothers are super, super geniuses  And I used to try to be funny  My mom would go  Oh, you're not funny, Michael  Don't try  It's sad, actually  You're making a fool of yourself  All right  All the Myers brothers  Who are funny  Take one step forward  Not so fast, Michael  Just don't try  Are they in the business?  Your brothers?  My brother's a music journalist  He's written two books  And he writes about music  And my other brother  Works in business  And thank you very much 
[01:26:30]  He's super, super funny  Yeah  So it was a great house  You know  We grew up in government-assisted housing  And the suburbs of Toronto  And again  When you own nothing  Except a sense of humor  You know  Yeah  Yeah, it kind of gets you through sometimes  Absolutely  Do you ever call Colin Quinn  And just read off the numbers  That Austin Powers did?  He always comes up to me  He goes  I just want to tell you something  I am an effing asshole  Let's just get that out 
[01:27:00]  Straight away  You called me  You called me not even once  You called me ten times  I'm an idiot  Stupid Colin  Wait, Mike  Mike called Colin for a role?  He offered him a role  In what movie?  Austin Powers  Oh my God  Initially Scott Evil  And then  Oh no  Things happen quickly  And the director, Jay Roach  Had a casting session  And he found Seth Green  Who I was really  You know  Seth Green's hilarious  Yeah  You know 
[01:27:30]  He just brought so much to it  But I had worked with Colin Quinn  On Saturday Night Live  And you know  He's just so funny  He's just a funny dude  And I just thought  It would be great to have  Do you ever meet like  Like  I'm like way taller than my dad  You know  And I'm not even tall  I'm 5'7 and a half  Though I claim 5'8 on my hockey card  You know  And my  You know  I just thought it would be hilarious  To have you know  A son that was a good  Three or four feet tall  Weighted four times as much  He's a big dude 
[01:28:00]  That's hilarious  Because Colin's a really good friend  Of the show  He does the show a lot  I did not know  Oh I can't wait for him  To come back in here  It's the beauty  Because Colin criticizes  He's the most brutal guy I know  And he'll always  And it's like  He refused that  But he accepted  Crocodile Dundee 2  Crocodile Dundee 2  That's the beauty of Colin  He's made the worst movie blunders  In history  But he's Colin  He's so funny  He told the funniest joke  About  He said  You know  I got Al Jazeera  You know  I got all the cable stations  I got Al Jazeera  You know  For the kids 
[01:28:30]  He's hilarious  He lives really close to here  So he might pop in that door  Because whenever we're talking bad about him  He comes running in  So who knows  He might show up now  Well let's talk bad about him  Because I miss him  He's a good dude  I run into him all the time  In New York  The last story we had from him  Was when he  And this was  He just caught hell for this one  He was pushing Jerry Seinfeld's car  To start it  Out in front of  Where was it  Comedy Cellar  Down Mineta Lane 
[01:29:00]  Yeah  And Jerry apparently  Couldn't get his car started  So it needed a bump start  Yeah  And Colin was pushing it  And some guy  Right at the end of it  When he pushed Jerry's car  And Jerry's car starts  And drives away  Some guy turns around  And goes  Hey good work Colin  I just saw him pushing Jerry's car  Yeah made the paper  Very embarrassing for Colin  Yeah  He's a good guy  I love him  Speaking of the guys  From the past  Wayne's World  During the MTV Movie Awards  Man that made me really happy 
[01:29:30]  And you guys looked exactly  Like you did  When you made the movie  Some what  14, 15 years ago  Oh thank you  I gotta tell you man  That was so much fun to watch  I had missed Dana Carvey  He's like the funniest guy  I ever worked with  This guy  When I first got on  Saturday Night Live  I was a stupid new guy  From Nowheresville  I didn't have an office  My office was me  Being cross-legged  On my coat  By the elevator bank  Yeah  Lauren called security  On me four times  Dana had to go  Well no actually  Lauren you hired him 
[01:30:00]  He's in the cast  He's a great guy  Yeah  Phil Hartman  You know when you have  A group of friends  And this one guy  Is the guy that always calls  And keeps everybody together  We used to call him  The glue  Phil Hartman  When Phil passed away  And you know  It just sort of got hard  For all of us  To kind of get together  And then they said  Do you want to host  The MTV Movie Awards  And I'm like  I love doing it  Because you know  You get to do characters  And I love the excitement  Of a live show  Sure  And I said  Wayne's World  And so I called up Dana 
[01:30:30]  And came  And we didn't even rehearse  All we did was just  Tell old stories  And I feel like  I'm related to him  I think we're from  The same factory  Or something  But he's like a cousin  And we just couldn't  Stop talking  And they were like  Can we just rehearse  The scene please  And I'm like  Yeah okay one second  Hey do you remember  That time that guy  So it was great  He's a good guy  Wayne's World  He's in great shape now  I don't know  If you guys heard  He had like some  Weird heart thing too  No but  We did hear 
[01:31:00]  I forgot the exact story  But they operate  On the wrong part  Of his body right  Dana Carvey  Is the best  He's the most  Health conscious person  I've ever met  I mean we would do a show  He took me on tour  Took me under his wing  Which was super cool  And we would be out  And we would have  We'd have some brown pops  We would sample some  Local brood beverages  Which was super fun  After a show  And then he'd be up  At 6 o'clock in the morning  In the gym  Sweating 
[01:31:30]  Working out  He just had one of those  Genetic predisposition  For heart stuff  He had like three  Angioplasties  And they said  If this angio  You know when they put  The balloon in your heart  To open up the thing  They said if this one  Doesn't work  We're gonna have to operate  And he went okay fine  They operated on the wrong valve  You imagine  So he was out for  Like two years  And I'm like  That sucks  But honestly  This is a dude  Nothing but generous  He's a joy  Super super funny 
[01:32:00]  Did they go back in and kick him?  I just kept pimping him  To do Johnny Carson  The whole time  I was like his worst fan  Oh yeah  I was like in the back of the car  Because we drove all the way  Through mid America  And I was going  So what would Johnny do  If he was playing golf?  And he'd be like  Come on Mike  Give me a break  And he'd be like  Well that is weird  That is some weird wild stuff  And I'd be like  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yeah  He did do a great Carson man  And he's got  I feel he is Carson  Yeah  He's got HBO now  I think  Right  Yeah  I think I saw that on demand 
[01:32:30]  Or something  I gotta check it out  Why didn't they get  He had to play Carson  Because I don't know  Was he doing him back then  When that Leno Letterman movie  The Late Show  And they got Rich Little  Who was like  Who was like  Way 250  And he sounds like Johnny  But he looked  Nothing like him  Like why didn't they grab him  They should have got Dana  I don't know  I don't know  I saw that once  I thought it was pretty cool  Yeah he just didn't  He didn't look like him at all  He just kind of sounds like him  Wayne's World was one of those  Movies that  Obviously came from  An SNL skit  That really  Was successful  There were a few  You know  That kind of fall flat  And a lot of people  Have speculated  Did you have 
[01:33:00]  The Austin Powers character  In mind  During SNL  But didn't  Put it out there  As a character  For the show  Because  Again I've heard this  Because you know  Lauren gets a pretty nice  Cut of  Of money  From  Movies that come from  Characters from the show  So did you just go  I've got to hold this one back  And  The weirdest thing is  You know  Like you know  My dad's old  Encyclopedias  My mom worked in the office  Of the factory  This kind of business  Sense thing  Just really wasn't  Talked about  At the dinner table 
[01:33:30]  Do you know what I mean  It's not  You know  We were like  You know  A lot of topics  Of conversation  Were like  Hey the water heater  Doesn't work  You know  This is the sort of thing  So this kind of like  Thinking ahead  And strategizing  Just really wasn't  Part of the equation  Austin Powers was just  Every British comedy  My father loved  And when he died  I just went  You know what  I'm just going to do a movie  And I thought  If nobody gets it  Sure fair enough  I just need to make  A tribute to my father  But 
[01:34:00]  You know  The kind of thinking ahead stuff  Honestly  Yeah  You don't have any time  And  I'm just  I'm an okay businessman  But nothing in my gene pool  Would suggest that I'd be  Any good at it  You know what I mean  That was just a topic too  That  Like you said  If anybody gets it or not  It was one of those  Subjects that was like  I remember watching  Those movies as a kid  Yeah  You know  You'd watch these  I had fuzzy memories  That's all  I write from fuzzy memory  I don't do any research  But you know  It's so funny  You know  You do this stuff 
[01:34:30]  I mean  I grew up  Super working class  Like literally  Like  You know  And to this day  Like my mom  You know  For Christmas  My mom said  Oh I got you a lovely gift  I think you'll really love it  She got me tube socks  I'm like  Yeah  Tube socks  You know what I mean  But  This kind of like  Paul Bunyan  It's like  Why I  I believe he has  An ox named Blue  That weighs two tons  Why he can  Clear a forest  With one swoop 
[01:35:00]  Of his mighty axe  I'm like  No I'm an idiot  Actually  I'm an idiot  From Toronto  Got lucky  Who works hard  I'm the dude  That studied  For the exam  That's about it  Going back to  Austin Powers  I was reading up  On you last night  I didn't know  It didn't do well  At the box office  When it first came out  I had no idea  And then it found  Its way on DVD  I believe  And obviously  The movie is hilarious  So I don't even know  Why people didn't see it  Originally  But that must have  Been a little strange  Right  I'm just happy  To have a job 
[01:35:30]  And like I said  I'm just happy  To be an employer  I was just like this  You know  Up in Toronto  I went  God I'd love  To make comedies  And Gilda Radner  Played my mom  In a TV commercial  When I was 10  And I fell in love  With her  It was a 4 day shoot  And I cried  And my brothers  Called me  Sucky baby  And it's like  Sucky baby  They're like  Where to go  Sucky baby  Got something else  You want to cry about  And then they said  Hey  Sucky baby  Your girlfriend's  On some stupid show  On Saturday  Doesn't even have a name 
[01:36:00]  And it was  Saturday Night Live  And I went  God I'd love to be  On that show  And 14 years later  Not only  I was on it  But I didn't even know  That there would be  A show on  14 years later  Right  So it's all  Kind of just  Amazing  I still don't know  How it all happened  I pinched myself  And your movies  It's got to be said  Grossed over what  3 billion dollars  Something like that  I don't know  3 billion dollars  It's also got to be said  You can't  You just have to do stuff  That you think is funny  And you know  I love 
[01:36:30]  I love comedy  So  It's also got to be said  Sucky baby  Is not a great nickname  For a guy  But that could actually be hot  Under the right circumstances  For a chick  That's actually not a bad nickname  I wouldn't mind  Giving that to somebody  Can I just say  At this point  That I'm mildly uncomfortable  I'm not afraid  But we're entering a zone  Where I'm not quite sure  How I feel about that  What was your favorite character  To do on SNL  I like doing Ron Wood  Oh yeah  Because it's like  It got on  According to my  Came out of the gatling  I didn't even know  He took his shit on a turtle 
[01:37:00]  You know what I mean  We had some good times  Yeah  We had some good times  It didn't matter  What the gatling  I was saying  Because you know  It doesn't matter  Imagine  I guess you know  But that's  That's me man  Yeah  He's crazy me  I was watching  The one you did  With Nicole Kidman  Last night  Over and over again  I don't even know  The name of the character  Where you're the kid  And you're strapped to the  With the harness  And the helmet  Phillip  Phillip  Thank you  That was me as a kid  I was hypoglycemic  Oh my god  I was on a harness 
[01:37:30]  And I had a hockey helmet  My head is mostly scar tissue  So  And I had a big head  When I was a kid  You know  My dad used to always say to me  You know Michael  When you're indoors  Take off your hockey helmet  And I'm not wearing a hockey helmet  And it's like  Oh  Sorry  And you're a huge  Peter Sellers fan  What do you think of  Steve Martin  Redoing the movies  I thought he did a great job  I  You know  I'm  He's just such a great 
[01:38:00]  Steve Martin  Can do no wrong  You know  The jerk  They're shooting at the cans  They hate the cans  I love that  I didn't like him redoing  The Sellers roles  I was like  Because comedies  Shouldn't be redone  Yeah we feel like  Some of these movies  Just should not be redone  Peter Sellers  The Pink Panther movies  When they redid  The In-Laws  It's like  What are you doing  The movie was perfect  As far as the comedy goes  Yeah  It's a tough call  You know  Usually they remake movies  Because it was either  In black and white  And now it's color 
[01:38:30]  It was in  Silent  And now it's sound  Foreign language  Into this language  But you know  Some movies  Really do benefit  From like  The technology now  It's like  God you can do anything  Now with computers  Sure  Those are the things  That people usually  Do remakes for  Yeah  Yeah CGI stuff is great  Like you know  King Kong  I like what they did  With that  Yeah  Even from 77  To the one they just did  A couple years ago  Was a great improvement  But comedies  It's like  You're not gonna  There's no advance  That's gonna make  The jokes any better  It's like 
[01:39:00]  No  But there's some  Some cool stuff out there  I'm gonna do a movie  About the Battle of Britain  Which is the big thing  I wanna do next  My mom was in the Battle of Britain  Which is amazing  My mom had top security clearance  She knew that the British  Had broken the German codes  And you know  When you see those  Those ladies  With the big maps of England  And they have those  Bacharach  And it's like  Jerry's over Norfolk  Scramble big in hills  Mackenzie  Play the bagpipes 
[01:39:30]  I don't know  If it frightens the Germans  But by God  It terrifies me  That type of thing  That's  That's what my mom did  She has awesome stories  They used to use  The big map of England  As a Ouija board  Trying to figure out  Where the Germans  Were gonna attack next  And it was always right  Wow  That's weird  Yeah  And stuff like that  And just  I just  That's my big thing  I mean  I don't wanna like  Kill anybody  Or hurt anybody  But you know  I watch the History Channel  And when they have  Those gun sight cameras 
[01:40:00]  And a spitfire  Oh yeah  Yeah  And it strafes a train  And it blows up  And stuff like that  It's just amazing  I watch that all the time  I said  If it wasn't for the death  And maiming  Yeah  And stuff  War just looks like  The most fun you could have  I like it when stuff blows up  And I like those shows  Where like big trucks move earth  Yeah  Why is that?  Cause I'm simple  That's a lie  I love that stuff  I like you know  When they blow up hotel casinos  Yeah  And you know how it's gonna turn out  But it's like 
[01:40:30]  I'm gonna switch the channel  Forget it  Just gonna keep watching  Of course  I love it when stuff blows up  Blows up real good  Aren't you doing a Keith Moon movie too?  I'm developing  Well the writer's strike  Stopped everything  Messed up everything right?  Just was a big  I always wanna say spanner  In your country  Monkey wrench  We're separated by a common language  Americans and Canadians  Yeah  It just threw a  Just screwed everything up  I love Keith Moon man  I mean there was drumming 
[01:41:00]  Pictures of Lily  Is a masterpiece  There's drumming  Rock drumming  Before Pictures of Lily  And then rock drumming  After Pictures of Lily  He's like one of the only drummers  That used the drum kit  As a compositional tool  And he was just a nut  But a lovable nut  And I've done some research on him  And you know  It's like  It's like Farley  You know  Like Farley  You know  They described him  He was you know  A bad boy but a good man  As they said about Belushi too  You know  These people are fascinating 
[01:41:30]  And when you  When you get to meet somebody  So just  Hilarious  Like Farley  Farley  Every Saturday  I used to  Take a show  You know  You run your  Take a shower  You know  You run your lines  And you're so focused  And stuff  And every week  There's this  Public shower  You know  For men's shower  And every week  Farley used to  Take off his clothes  Come into the shower  And press me up  Against the wall  Prison style  And go  I love you Michael  Just kiss me 
[01:42:00]  And every week  I would forget  You know  And you just  Literally laugh  Until you whiz yourself  He's just  He's just so funny  He's knocked out  A tooth of mine  And I got like scars  On my hands  On my head  Because he was just crazy  He's like a Tasmanian devil  Man  Keith Moon was like that  And people like that  Are fascinating  And movies take a long time  I always have like  10 to 20 ideas  Circling the airport  I don't even know  What my next movie is  I just kind of go  What's in me 
[01:42:30]  And you know  I'm so lucky  I get to do this  For a living  I can't believe  It's worked out  As well as it has  Where I get to make something  And be part of something  And you know  Saturday Night Live  Was great for that  I have an idea  In the bath on Sunday  And see it on national TV  On Saturday  It's got to be  Obviously a good feeling  That things that you find funny  The masses find funny  Because you know  That's tough  But you can't 
[01:43:00]  You know  You'd go insane  If you  You know  If you had to go  Into a laboratory  And come up with  The least commercial idea  In the world  It would be Austin Powers  Yeah  An English dude  With bad teeth  That doesn't even look like  Real chest hair  He's really inappropriate  And I'm parodying parodies  Yeah  And at the time  It was parodying  A parody of a James Bond movie  This was before Casino Royale  I don't know if you saw  Casino Royale  Oh yeah yeah  That movie rocks  Wasn't that David Niven  No the new one 
[01:43:30]  The second  Oh right  The first one  Everyone's talking about  How great the new one is  Yeah I love the new one  The dude that cries blood  It's like just one  And then running  Just one awesome sequence  Yeah  But this wasn't that  When I came up with it  This was like  I mean bless  I won't even name names  Because I don't want to  Hurt anybody's feelings  But it was at  It's lowest point  And so if you had to  Go into a laboratory  Come up with that  And then all of a sudden  It's like  People are like  I like that movie  And I'm like  I just have the greatest job 
[01:44:00]  In the world you know  I don't know how  It all works out  I gotta ask you about  The Dr. Evil  Lorne connection there  It's more Donald Pleasance  Is it really  A Donald Pleasance thing  If you look back  It's the same kind  Of Englishy accent  Yeah  But hey listen  Lorne gave me  A break in TV  Lorne gave me  A break in movies  Lorne's like  The smartest dude  I know  He is honestly  Just  You know  It's one of those  Rare occasions  Where you work  For a producer  Who's funnier than you are  And you're not  Sitting there going  Okay here's the joke 
[01:44:30]  Here's what I meant  And he's a great  Joke repair man  Which is awesome  As is Conan O'Brien  By the way  Yeah  The best joke repair man  In the world  Joke repair man  Well no  Cause you come in  You kinda got it  You got it  It's almost there  It's the  Near funny  Yeah  It's virtually funny  And these dudes  Can make it actually funny  But you know  He  He has a private army  Lorne  You know  That's what it was  He has his lair  He has a private army  But everything's done  With love  I'm 
[01:45:00]  I'm indebted to that man  Will be for the rest  Of my life  Yeah  Save me a break  Do you have another  Austin Powers movie in you  You think  I have  You know  It's one of the  10 to 15 ideas  That is circling the airport  This one would be from  Dr. Evil's point of view  It would be  In essence  Dr. Evil 1  The start of a new trilogy  Nice  From his thing  And it just has to get written  And it takes a long time  You know  When you create  Create and write  And produce  These things just eat up 
[01:45:30]  All your time  And it's exciting work  And it's fun  And it's great  But it just takes a long time  You got one of the coolest  Two pieces of like  Band  I guess  Memorabilia ever  George Harrison's  Last letter  This is an amazing  Thing  That I sometimes  I often get choked up  Telling about  You know  My dad was from Liverpool  Working class  So proud that the Beatles  Came from Liverpool  You have no idea 
[01:46:00]  I did  Austin Powers 3  And it was  The  You know  The Austin pussy  You know  The fake opening  Of the movie  Like they did  One of the James Bond movies  Where they had a guy  That was supposed to be  Sean Connery  And they were  Trying to figure out  How to kill James Bond  So I just went  Oh wouldn't that be great  So I called up  Steven Spielberg  Because I did Shrek  Right  And so  I said  Steven I got this idea  I would love for you  To be the director  Of Austin pussy  Which is the movie  Within the movie 
[01:46:30]  You know  And he said  I love it  Tell me what to wear  And when to show up  I'm like  I'm sorry  I thought I was going to  Have to like  Pitch this thing  For two hours  I had all these ideas  I was going to come over  With charts  I was going to  Juggle kittens  Have sparks coming out  Of my ass  Anything to get him  To do it  And he's such a lovely guy  You know  Steven Spielberg  He called all these people  And so it's one day  We called it Big Friday  And because we had to  Change for everybody's schedule  Just to rechange the schedule  Was a million dollars 
[01:47:00]  Just because  Wow yeah  Movies are so  So expensive  So we called it Big Friday  We shot outdoors  At Paramount  I wake up  It's raining  We don't have rain cover  I'm like  We're dead  Then I put on CNN  And George Harrison  Has died  I cried like a baby  You know  George was my favorite  He was spiritual  And just cool  Man  Just  Just cool  He's died  And I thought  This should be the best day  Of my life  It's the worst day  Of my life  Then I get a call 
[01:47:30]  From a guy  Who's a private investigator  And he was like  I'm very  But he was in an  Underground parking lot  So he was like  Very important  And I'm like  What?  Okay I'll call you later  Bye  And I thought  Okay so some dude  Wants to kill me  Or something  I don't know  But there's a letter  He has to show me  It's probably written  In somebody's blood  I don't know  What the hell it is  So I go  And I'm sitting  I'm in the makeup room  And there's  Steven Spielberg  There's  Kevin Spacey 
[01:48:00]  Danny DeVito  Gwyneth Paltrow  Tom Cruise  And I'm sitting there  Like  I feel like  I'm in  Madame Tussauds  It looks like  The Wax Museum  Like I can't believe it  Drives up  Jay Roach  The director  Geniusly  You know like  In basketball  Where they mop it up  You know  When somebody falls  And they mop up the sweat  He did that  Like on the grandest scale  Came up with a genius idea  He's so smart  Jay  Son comes out  We shoot it  Better than written  Unbelievably great  I'm like  Tears in my eyes

[01:50:00]  Would come on  There was a truce  In the house  And even the house  Smelled better  When a good comedy  Would come on  So it means a lot to me  I work really hard  Because I go  God you know  Movies are  You know  The price goes up  Every week  Then plus popcorn  Plus milk duds  Plus babysitter  Parking  Diet coke  I mean it's a major investment  And so I go  Every molecule  Of this movie  Better be entertaining man  Because it's a lot  Yeah and let's talk about  The love guru  Because we only have  Like two or three minutes left  Mike Meyer

[01:59:30]  Oh thanks  Just to get the  Lynch up  Now first of all  No one understands  That this  You know  Obviously we're  Dave and Buster's  On a date  With cameras  Following us around  That maybe  There's a little bit  Of tongue in cheek  In this whole thing  Right  But when  As a radio show  When they try to get us  In this situation  We're like  Go F yourself  That's  You are no  Jill Nicolini  That's  This is TV though  Yeah  We've had TV  Try to like 
[02:00:00]  Get us to do  Wacky stuff  We always said  No  I don't find you pretty  That's alright  That's fine  Here's  So here's some audio  Of their  One month anniversary  At David Buster's  Yesterday  The video's up on  Onaradio.com  So what's next  For Aunt Fellini  Aunt Fellini and I  Have a very special  One month anniversary  Vacation plan  Yeah  We're headed out the door  To the Bahamas  Any plans for like  Engagement  Or  Or is that just  Crazy talk 
[02:00:30]  Oh that's  People are  Let people speculate  I think  Because  Athelini being like  You know  Brangelina  Bennifer  That type of  Hollywood elite  They like keeping  Things  You know  Under  Underwrapped  A little while  Africa  Africa trip  Adopt some children  Yes  I'm thinking  We should go  I'm thinking  A little like  Norway  Somewhere no one  Goes to adopt  Children  Interesting  A little Norwegian  Child  Oh that'd be cute 
[02:01:00]  As long as it's  Cuter than the one  That we had tonight  At the  Photomorph booth  What's wrong with that kid  Oh my goodness  Oh we're condemned to have ugly children  I can feel the magic  I don't know  I get in the way  That kind of magic  But what do you say  To your detractors though  Because there are people  That are saying  You're doing this  Purely for publicity  How would you answer that  Oh my goodness  It's just  Spend the day with us  Spend five minutes with us  And you can see 
[02:01:30]  And you'll be disgusted  Because  Everyone else in our family  Oh my goodness  What about South  Your stepfather this weekend  Yeah  What did he say  He said  They're always whispering  Little things to each other  Gee  Who knew  You know  One of those things  They don't even look at me  How can you  You're ruining the natural reaction  Of Stephen Lynch  I hear the laughter  Okay 
[02:02:00]  I hear it  I see it  Let it play out  My favorite part  Is the way that  When he said  When they said Africa  He went  Oh maybe Norway  You didn't have the guts  To say  I want a white kid  So he's just naming  Maybe Austria  Germany  Norway  Finland  Look at Lynch  You can't stop laughing  You know  I'm just being ripped apart here  And there's no reason for it  I really don't understand  Why you would be  We went  We go out  We  Okay  There's no need for booze 
[02:02:30]  I don't really  You know  So we got another clip  That we're gonna play for everybody  Yeah  What do you think so far Mr. Lynch  I'm  This is so embarrassing  I can't even look over there  Really  You're gonna break your guitar  Across the radio host  Come on  I've known you for ten years  And I've never seen you like this  Look  You heard one clip  Yeah  What about the picture of you  Holding pink bags  Look at that  Yeah  Lynch's bag  Look  Okay look  That first of all  Is a big pink boxing glove 
[02:03:00]  That was one in the  In the crane  And then  That  Yes  Is a pink bag  It's very heavy  And why wouldn't you carry  Your lady's bag  If it's very heavy  The big boxing glove  Huh  Did somebody punch you  In the dignity  With it  You guys want another clip  Or what  One more here  I  I kind of like  That song  You dream me into life  You know  You look at something  Long enough  You envision something  Long enough  And it just  Pop  Magically appears 
[02:03:30]  Is that how things work  Yeah  It's like that vision board  Thing I told you about  Like in the secret  Like that book  You know  Okay  I'm gonna envision  That  Opie and Jimmy  Do not rip me to pieces  For this whole  Segment  Opie and Jimmy  Rip me to pieces  Please  Given the special  Nature of this whole thing  And given what you do  Anthony  Is there  What's off limits  To this  For your show  Um  That's a good question  Because uh  Contrary to  Everything you're seeing  On this whole 
[02:04:00]  Segment  I'm supposedly  A shock jock  So uh  You'd assume  Nothing's off limits  But um  Yeah  Until I see  A line  And nothing's  Off limits  We talk about  Everything  Are you getting  I see a line  Here  We just want to  Ask the public  To leave us alone  Please  Just leave us alone  And let us be  Oh my goodness  No  Like the Beatles 
[02:04:30]  Love is all there is  And certainly true  With Jill  Nicolini  And Anthony  Cumia  With your  Anne Fellini update  This is Doug  Venoni  At cw11.com  This really is  Getting out of control  This really is getting out of control  I mean this is just  The  And the  The listeners have just  Completely made a U-turn  The same people that were so  Happy  For me  Just mere  Days ago  Or weeks ago  Are now  Just calling me a sloppy  Party bottom  Anthony 
[02:05:00]  Have you been pink socked?  Anthony  You're a hypocrite  Did you up your estrogen?  They are  Pounding me  Can't imagine why  After such a light hearted  Charming segment  So how was Europe  Lynch?  Hey as Paul McCartney said  Love is all there is  What is he talking about?  I don't know  Look I didn't write it  No McCartney didn't say that  He said could you wash the stump 
[02:05:30]  The room smells like a belly button  They're calling it  Douchealini  Hey  Anthony  You can act like a man  What's the matter with you?  Before we put this to bed for now  Sam and Derek  Have  Put something together for you  The updates are back  With more news coming in  The Anthelini power couple  Is truly taking over the media  As the two are now  Starring in a video  That they have produced  For the CW11  Is it just hanging out  And saving busters? 
[02:06:00]  Following us around  Following us around  On one of our many  Fun filled little dates  That we go on  Hey  They allowed a news network  To film them  Celebrating their one month  Anniversary at Dave and Buster's  The two played games  Laughed  Sang  And even put  Jill Nicolini  In the claw machine  Talk about special treatment  She had to run out of it  Because it was chasing her  Anthelini even used  A computer generator  To see what their kids  Would look like 
[02:06:30]  If they had them  Yeah  Right  If  They have got to be  The ugliest children  That ever came out  Of a machine  Anthony and Jill  Will be spending  National Anthelini Day  Shirking their responsibilities  And pretending they don't  Have jobs  In the Bahamas  I am going  To the Bahamas  To get married  What?  Could Jill come back  Akumia?  Not a chance  But our sources  Are telling us  That we may have to  Get used to saying  Anthony Nicolini  In a quick retraction  Opie from radio's 
[02:07:00]  The Anthelini Experience  Was recently credited  As saving a life  We found out today  That not only  Did he have  Absolutely nothing  To do with  Bringing the listener  Down from the brink  Of disaster  But it was Anthelini  That gave the man  A reason to live  Are you telling me  Tom wait  Oh my god  Don't tell me  Look at the scene  Now this is breaking news  Anthelini  Was your inspiration  To live  Of course it was  Yes  It seems the only thing  The Anthelini power couple  Can't do  Is disappoint 
[02:07:30]  And yes  They are fertile  Stay tuned  As the O&A updates  Continue  I don't like these updates  Sam doing a great job  Of those  And Derek  Helping out  Doing very  Very good work too  Wow  Alright  Enough of that  Central Park  Yeah  Jimmy  Yeah we really  Want to move on  So that's  Summer stage  Maybe I can bring you guys out  And you know  You could take a bow  No they're going to be  On a plane  In a mere few hours  Oh yes  Next time  Summer stage tonight

[02:08:30]  What do you want  From these people  Yeah that was back  That was back when you were  Single though  You've changed so much  Since then  I know why  Steven stopped doing  The show by the way  Why  There was a moment  He comes in  Was it Guinness or something  He had like his own  Like 12 pack  And he's drinking beers  It's like 6.37 in the morning  Looks around  And he's like  What the hell  No one's drinking with me  We're like  Steven we're drinking coffee  It's early  It's not the afternoon show anymore  Lightweights  That was the last  I saw of you  You walked out 
[02:09:00]  With your beers  Oh over at XM  Yeah yeah  Yeah yeah  Because it was  It's early  You were very disappointed  No one would have a brew with you  Because we would drink  All the time  Me and Steven  Would drink all the time  During the afternoon show  Yeah  It was so easy  You could just  You know  Those days are over  It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon  You're drinking  We're all adults  And sober now  Yeah  Wow  Doing the best we can  Well  Trying  You got any new CDs  Or anything  No I have some new songs  But I'm trying to get a new CD  For Christmas time  Can we hear a song 
[02:09:30]  That would be like  Awesome actually  Yeah  Let me try this new one here  Although  You know  I really  Can't play any of this stuff  On the radio  I was wondering  Do you have like a  Beep  Oh  Type of thing  Yeah  Do you think I could just  Sort of cue you  To hit that every once in a while  I hope it works  I'll give it a whirl  All right  Well let's practice  Okay  Right so  Hey I'd love to  You in the  All right  Perfect  You got it  Now try doing this  You know  Music  Music 
[02:10:00]  Might be a little different  If I hear you say the word bunt  I'll know the next line coming up  Maybe I should beep  But not if it's used as a proper noun  Right  This is bunt  All right  This song is called Waiting  Did you do it?  Yeah  Okay  Just practicing  It's out of my hands  And all I can do is wait  It's the not knowing 
[02:10:30]  That has put me in this state  The minutes feel like hours  The tension is too great  I've done my part  So now it's in the hands of fate  Waiting for my AIDS test to come back  I shouldn't have bunt that prostitute  Without a prophylactic  Waiting for my AIDS test to come back  Regret is dripping from me  Like my bunt  Down her crack  And now I wait 
[02:11:00]  Is that working?  Yeah  Oh it's perfect  My nerves they have been frayed  My pants they have been bunt  I know the nurse will say  It's time to have a chat  At least I'll never worry  About getting fat  I should think positive  No wait  I didn't say that  Waiting for my AIDS test to come back  I never should have bunt that tranny in my Cadillac 
[02:11:30]  Waiting for my AIDS test to come back  I just had to taste that sweet forbidden nectar from his sack  And now I wait  Is it over?  Will my jersey be retired?  Will my name stitched upon a quilt be required?  Did I make a difference?  Was my life inspired?  Will Denzel Washington defend me when I'm fired? 
[02:12:00]  Waiting for my AIDS test to come back  Eating a**hole shouldn't be an aphrodisiac  Waiting for my AIDS test to come back  If I'm clean I swear to God  I will stop shooting smack  Probably  Boys and girls don't be naïve 
[02:12:30]  Take it from your Uncle Steve  AIDS cares not whom it affects  Caught from unprotected sex  Sharing needles  Blood or spit  Or f***  Or f***  Even f***  From handshakes, sneezes  Toilet seats  From monkey bites  And uncooked meats  From dirty coins 
[02:13:00]  And dreadlocked hair  From certain children  In daycare  Drinking water  Breathing air  I tell you AIDS is everywhere  Oh God  I can't take any more  I think I'll run right out that door  But wait  The nurse comes straight away  Tell me  What does my test say? 
[02:13:30]  I'm okay  I'm okay  I'm okay  It's just chlamydia  All right  Yeah, right on  Steven Lynch  I didn't have my phones on  So I couldn't tell  Oh yeah  I always love accompanying you  On certain songs 
[02:14:00]  I think I played a whistle once  Yeah  Always fun  Have you been touring Europe, Steven?  Mm-hmm  They're loving Steven Lynch over there, huh?  I guess so, man  How long were you over?  I went over for three weeks  And I came back  And went back for three weeks  Wow  It was unbelievable  All these kids  And I will say that I  I think I just had my comedy bar mitzvah  In that I played Germany for the first time  Ooh  And I was debating doing the Nazi song there  And I thought  I am not a man unless I play the Nazi song  Yeah  Angry Germans 
[02:14:30]  Yeah  You could probably get in trouble for that though over there  I don't think they like acknowledging that whole part of their history  For some reason  That's why I had to do it  And it worked  It was great  They loved it  They loved it  Did you see if Steven Lynch whips them all up into that frenzy  They get into every so often  To, you know, take over the world  They're like, yeah  You got video of that?  I'm sure there's video of it  God, we need to see video of you doing that song in Germany  Yeah  Well, we're running out of show over here  But we'd love to get another one out of you if you could

No, I haven't played this on the show  And  I don't know, I just thought they were really beautifully written 
[02:15:30]  And so I took a few  And they spanned from recently to hundreds of years ago  All these diary entries, sort of unknown  And so I took a few of them and set them to music  And maybe I'll take you out on one of them here  So  This is a diary entry that I just thought was really lovely  Dear diary, today is a good day  Papa and I picked wild flowers  Mama joined and we lay in the sunshine 
[02:16:00]  Then we sang and danced for hours  I know tomorrow will be even better  So the good Lord I thank  I'll write more later  Love, Anne Frank  So, yeah, I mean, I don't know who this Anne Frank is  But I'm sure she lived a long and wonderful life  But I just thought it was a really pretty, you know 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that's  I played that one in Germany, too  That one they did not laugh at  No  We didn't laugh at that one  No  In fact, it was cold, stony silence  They just looked at the ground a little bit  Yeah, the aw shucks look  Oh, yeah, you got us  We had an action-packed show today  Oh, yeah  We ran out of time, Stephen  I mean, you gotta hang more often  I'll come back  All right, he'll come back  Summer stage tonight with Mike Birbiglia

[02:20:30]  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  With his entourage?  Yes.  Is that your entourage over there, Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve has an entourage.  I like that.  This show's more partner than Howard Sturridge.  And of course, and of course, he has already begun. 
[02:21:30]  Howard Sturridge can't beat this.  Holy shit, he said something intelligent.  Howard Sturridge ain't gonna win.  Tippi Tom, everyone.  Tippi Tom, everyone.  Let's hear it for Tippi Tom.  There are people on the bleachers wearing surgical masks and other kind of protective gear.  One guy has a shirt pulled over his nose.  Yeah.  There's surgical masks and people just putting their teeth.  Hey, get a mic on Tippi Tom.  I heard you in Mexico, he says.  Who was in Mexico, Tom?  Tippi.  Who was in Mexico? 
[02:22:00]  Who's in Mexico?  What should I say?  Who's in Mexico?  Well, a guy named Tippi Tom was in Mexico.  Let's see, who else is in Mexico?  Well, I think Overy and Anthony might be there.  But they're here in New York now.  I think.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Hey, Sam, I gotta ask the guys behind.  How bad does Tippi Tom smell?  Oh, my God.  It really is bad because I walked in and I was amazed by how many people were here for 
[02:22:30]  the show today.  And then all of a sudden, I didn't see Tippi Tom, but I smelled him.  That's how big.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom, you stink.  You stink.  Well, nobody smells that good.  And so, you know, but I rule.  But I rule.  That's why I use root.  Hold on.  Give them a hug.  All right, Travis.  The funny thing about working for the show is that Danny and I both don't think he smells 
[02:23:00]  that bad today.  But, like, just what we've known.  Yeah, you know something?  As opposed to the audience.  You're right.  No.  He doesn't smell as bad today as he has.  As soon as you walk in, you smell them, though, man.  But there have been, the last time he was in had to be the funkiest he ever was.  Well, Tippi, I heard Tippi say to somebody outside that he doesn't smell that bad because  he just took a bath three weeks ago.  Yeah, three weeks ago.  And he uses brute.  See, you guys don't get it because he, uh, you're not in close quarters with him.  When I bring him here in a car, it's horrendous. 
[02:23:30]  Because you can't, you have to have all the windows open and your head out the window.  Do you use your own personal car?  No, no, no, no.  No.  Except for the one time I was returning Ange's lease, and I did put him in the back of the  car because the leasing company was scumbag.  So I put him in the back on the way.  You should have left him in there when he turned in the car.  Yeah.  Hey, what am I doing here?  Look at these guys.  They're just plugging up their, uh, noses, man.  You guys want Tippy Tom to leave the area?  Uh, please.  Tom's got a whole bench to himself, too. 
[02:24:00]  I gotta tell you, yeah, Anthony has the observation.  There's easily 40, 50 people out there, and the bleachers are packed.  There's a ton of people standing in the back.  No one will sit on the front of the bleachers.  Yeah.  Or in the second row, even.  Yep.  You know where you should sit, Tom?  There's a, uh, maybe there's a little office in the back there where you could sit, Tom,  for a little while.  Because Ron and Fez like Tom.  I think you should bring Tom to the Ron and Fez office.  Okay, I'm smelling him now.  We're gonna have Tippy Tom change his clothes in, uh, Ron and Fez's office. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And he can leave his clothes in there.  That's how much we like those guys, you know.  Can you buy me a beer?  Yeah, get him a beer.  Can you buy me a beer?  What is this, a bar?  It's Friday, Tom, right?  Don't forget your food, Tom.  Hey, Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Have Tom do a circle around the bleachers for everybody.  Yes, I do.  It's a photo op for everybody, because a lot of people bring cameras to the Opie and Anthony  show.  Photo op.  Photo op.  Walk through the crowd, Tom.  Walk through the crowd. 
[02:25:00]  Walk through the crowd.  Over here?  No.  Walk through the crowd.  I'm not talking radio.  Wait, walk around.  I'll take the mic.  Go that way.  Go that way.  Yeah.  Sam, follow him with the mic, and then he'll follow you.  Yep.  All right.  He's walking.  There he goes.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's walking through the crowd.  Oh, the crowd's horrified.  It looks like they're running with the bulls in Spain, the way they play it. 
[02:25:30]  Where's he going?  He's just wandering around.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve is doing Saturday Night Virus this weekend.  Tomorrow night, of course.  What time?  Not a guy.  Hold on.  Weird Medicine.  Why isn't his mic on?  Put his mic on.  What's this one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Try it again.  Oh, it's Weird Medicine, 9 p.m. Eastern on the Saturday Night Virus.  Yeah.  And it's your thing.  Every time you come to New York to do your Saturday Night Virus and say hi to the boys, it's your 
[02:26:00]  thing to stick a finger up someone's ass.  Right.  My thing.  Is that his thing?  How did I become a thing?  What have you?  You stuck fingers up Pat Duffy's ass?  Pat Duffy.  Roland.  And that was very special.  Yeah.  Roland opened wide.  Did he really?  Oh, I got it.  It was Friday wide.  Sorry, I blew it.  I'm not kidding.  Friday wide.  And today, you're either going to put fingers up Big A's ass or fingers up, we're hoping, 
[02:26:30]  Tippi Tom's ass.  Right.  And I've never seen Big A look more relieved when he saw Tom walk in.  Well, how about one of each at the same time?  Yeah, I think you need to do a double today.  Yeah.  Fucking Eastwood.  All right, what's going on out there, Sam?  Sam, what's going on?  That's Willy Wonka.  Willy Wonka?  Ow.  People are taking off their shirts and fanning the air toward Tom.  Tippi insisted that you guys wanted him to sing a song, and then I wanted him to sing 
[02:27:00]  a song.  Okay.  So he's serenading me with some of the tunes from Willy Wonka.  All right, let's hear a song there, Tom.  I like Willy Wonka.  Let's hear a song, Tom.  He's my favorite.  Yeah.  Willy Wonka at a chocolate factory.  Come with me, and you'll be in a world of your imagination.  Take a look at a book, and you'll be in your imagination.  Your imagination!  Simply do it! 
[02:27:30]  He's killing it.  Won't it change the world?  There's nothing to it.  Yeah!  That's it!  Nice.  That's Willy Wonka!  Yeah.  That's...  And the chocolate factory is his underwear.  He's...  He's doing this all with dignity, as his fly is undone.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, we just got breaking news.  Cream Pie Jones will also take fingers up his ass from Dr. Steve. 
[02:28:00]  They're lining up today for their exams.  Where's Cream Pie Jones?  Yeah, he freaked out the other day when the...  He just...  He's on a run.  When the porn star...  Oh, he's on a run?  Porn star wanted to give him a blowjob.  Yeah.  And, um...  Allegedly.  And he, uh, well...  Tell that fat flop!  He freaked out.  But he's okay with me doing my...  Well, yeah, apparently so.  That's a little odd, isn't it?  That's a little odd.  Hog out the whole studio, you motherfucker! 
[02:28:30]  But, Tom, our names are on the billboard.  I'm sorry.  He's like...  He's talking about us.  Tom!  Well, anyway, thank you for the beer!  You're welcome.  Tom, can you hear us?  Uh, bring Tom in.  Bring him over there.  Bring him.  Oh, the crowd loves that.  I'll cheer.  Well, they're cheering, because then, you know, they can get some fresh air.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tippy Tom has made his way into the studio.  No, over there!  Tom!  You gotta sit over there. 
[02:29:00]  Way over there.  Yeah, over there.  Holy shit.  Hey, Tom, were you in West Virginia working in the mines?  The fuck, Tom?  He's not as bad as usual.  Tom!  What have you been up to since the last time we saw you?  Well, what I've been doing is making millions of dollars.  Yeah.  And, um, I forgot where I put it.  Yeah.  I buried my money.  Yeah.  And so I gotta go looking for it. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  And so I can come out with some more money.  Yeah.  So I buried cans and stuff like that, and blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.  Yeah.  It probably does.  And so what I gotta do is I gotta go find where I put it.  Yeah.  Hey, are you still wearing the underpants we gave you the last time?  Excuse me?  I can't hear you, sir.  Are you still wearing the underpants that we gave you?  Oh!  That you gave me here?  The last time we saw you, we cut your underpants off.  And there was, like, a shit brick in there.  You got another new...  That was last time. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I got new ones.  Tom's dressing stylish.  I went to the Stylation Army, and they gave me brand new pants, because I wore the ones  out that they gave me.  He's looking very stylish.  Who did you kill for those clothes?  You need a belt, huh?  Who did I kill?  Tom, you need a belt, don't you?  Are you holding your pants up?  I'm holding them up right now.  What do you think?  Are they too big for you?  No.  What's the matter?  Those golden buns want to hold your pants up? 
[02:30:30]  Golden buns get skinny.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, and you'll keep getting skinnier.  Why are you getting skinny there, Tom?  No, my hiney.  And, um...  They call me flat ass, and I don't recall that, because I had the golden buns.  Yeah.  And that's why I want to be known as...  Hey, has the crowd seen Tippi Tom's ass yet?  You guys want to see golden buns?  Yeah, it looks like they said yes. 
[02:31:00]  Kimmy, are they saying yes out there?  Yeah, they want to see.  Yeah, I think that...  Tom, go back outside there, Tom.  They want to cheer for Tom.  They want to cheer for Tom.  This crowd...  They're cheering for Tom.  Wow, no, wow.  This person loves Tom.  And there's...  And there's golden buns.  He's got a whiff.  Yeah, he's thinking.  Oh, my God.  I just made him do it.  His hands fell off, because my golden buns are getting small. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, Sam, talk to the crowd.  Anybody want...  Anyone have a comment about golden buns there?  What did you guys think of golden buns?  What did you think of golden buns?  It was coming with me.  He's got a skeleton already.  Who's the original golden buns?  Me!  I'm the original golden buns!  I'm gold-bun granddaddy.  I am the best.  Holy crap, is that the worst smell? 
[02:32:00]  There's all the fake golden buns out there.  Oh, God, it's awful.  I'm the real golden buns.  Hey, Danny, grab his mic and show everybody the real golden buns, please.  Sorry, Tippy.  We got the real golden buns in studio.  I'm the original golden buns!  You're just a buzzer!  Get all these fake tippy towns running around.  I'm the original golden buns!  Hold it.  Let me show my original golden buns, everybody!  That's my original golden buns!  Is Danny showing his ass?  That's the original golden buns!  Oh, God, that smell.  Danny has a fat little rump.  Competition! 
[02:32:30]  Tom goes, okay, competition.  I got a little competition!  Yeah!  Hey, where's Cream Pie Jones?  Yeah, but can you shake them buns like me?  You can't shake.  Yeah.  Shake them buns!  Come on, shake with me!  Where's the Cream Pie Jones?  We gotta talk to him.  I think he might still be out right now.  Oh, all right.  Where can you shake them buns?  Tom's sweatshirt has dollar symbols.  Oh, my God, he can't!  He had a big portrait of Benjamin Franklin from the $100 bill. 
[02:33:00]  Bad day for me.  We also have Brie Olsen stopping by, the porn star she was in once.  Yeah, where is she?  Is she here yet?  Not yet.  Not yet, okay.  I hate to bail, but I got a fucking plane.  Oh, boy.  Sucks on a day like this.  Huh?  Brie just got here?  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice big audience.  Tippi Tom's stench.  Boy, this sucks.  And I have to go down to the Bahamas and drink banana rum drinks. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, that really sucks.  By a pool.  We get to stay with Tippi Tom while you fucking hobnob with Nicolini in a bikini.  It sucks to be you.  I'll leave it in your capable hands, boys.  I'll be listening.  I'm sure it's going to be entertaining radio with this crazy motherfucker out there as he  just keeps drinking. 
[02:34:00]  I got the best ass.  No, I'm not saying you have a bad ass.  I'm just saying that you are not Golden Bungs.  I am Golden Bungs.  And I am the best.  Was anyone disputing his title as Golden Bungs?  It's like there's people clamoring to be Golden Bungs.  No, no, sir.  I'm Golden Bungs.  No one's arguing.  Oh, no, we have another Golden Bung.  No one's arguing.  The Golden Bung Party.  Wait a minute.  The Golden Bung Party.  No.  He thinks everyone's here for him.  I know. 
[02:34:30]  I'll let him.  All right.  Hey, Tom, everyone showed up for you today, buddy.  Everyone's here for you.  Everyone's here for you.  We're all in the Golden Bung.  We want to see Golden Bung.  No, no, no, no.  Golden Bung.  Golden Bung.  All right, gentlemen.  I'll be in touch.  All right, buddy.  Have a safe trip.  Have a safe flight.  Thanks to the Bahamas.  Hold this, please. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Stronger shirt.  All right.  I want to dance.  You want to dance, Tom?  Stand back.  You want to get this?  The Tippy Tom step.  All right.  Come on.  Get some music going.  What song you want, Tom?  It goes like this.  We're going to go to...  What is he doing?  I don't know.  The shit shuffle.  Yeah.  It's the Tippy Tom step. 
[02:35:30]  Two.  And I can sing this.  Oh, here's Cream Pie.  Sam, we'll get back to Tippy Tom in a second.  Come on.  Let me sing.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ladies and gentlemen, Cream Pie Jones has entered the studio.  We haven't talked to him since his outbreak.  His nervous breakdown.  Can I say so, please?  Hold on, Tom.  We're going to get back to you in a second here.  Stupid.  How are you feeling, Cream Pie?  All right.  A lot better.  Thank you.  Good.  So, walk us through it.  We were trying to do something nice for your birthday. 
[02:36:00]  You can close that door, Sam, for a second.  We'll get back to you, Tom.  We were trying to do something nice for your birthday.  We had Lisa Sparks in studio with three X's.  And she was going to do a little something-something for you.  At the very least, give you the best lap dance ever.  And you freaked out.  And you ran away.  You started puking uncontrollably.  And then you had to call in sick the next day, because you were just a nervous wreck.  Yeah, I kind of had a nervous breakdown. 
[02:36:30]  I'm sorry.  Why?  What happened?  I don't know.  It was just...  Is there someone in your life?  No.  Okay, so it wasn't loyalty to a chick.  No.  Okay.  I just...  I don't know.  Do you have a little penis?  I don't know.  Yes, you do.  Is it little?  Probably, yeah.  How big is it?  Yes, you do know.  How big is your cock?  What, like six inches?  That's not bad.  Arrest that man.  Wait, here.  Tom, what happened? 
[02:37:00]  What...  Who do you want arrested?  Arrest him.  Why do you want him arrested?  Arrest him right now.  Put the cuff on him.  Come on.  Why?  Get over here and cuff him.  Why?  Why do you want to arrest Sam?  Well, because he insulted me.  What?  What did he say?  It hurt my feelings, man.  What did I do?  What did he say?  You said my golden buns weren't golden.  I'm in third place.  I did not know that.  You're in third place.  Now I know.  All right.  Get back out there.  Hang with the listeners.  They're here for you, Tom. 
[02:37:30]  Tom is charming today.  He's a whimsical, charming man when he's only been drinking for four hours.  Yeah, he's still relatively sober.  So, drink pie.  Yes.  Probably too personal, but I got to ask.  Do you like girls?  Yes.  Okay.  I do.  As you smile and smirk.  You do.  So, what was the problem?  I don't know.  What got to you?  I think it was just being in a room full of, you know, guys and all that stuff.  That kind of made me a little bit.  Were you afraid that your penis was going to be humiliating and minuscule? 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  That's fair enough.  And it wouldn't get hard.  And she'd be pulling on it and she'd be fucking probably berating you or something.  Or we'd all be laughing at you.  Yeah.  Yeah, jackass.  Jack and police.  Yes?  Yes.  Wait, what happened, Tom?  Tom keeps opening the door and screaming.  It's like the fact that Sam closed the door.  He's telling Sam to get a haircut.  No, you tell officer that he got a bad haircut? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  He look like a freak.  Sam, he doesn't like your hair.  No, it's Keith's hair.  He doesn't like Keith's hair.  Give me Tom's face for real.  You don't like Sam's hair?  You can't catch me, guy.  I run faster than you.  Oh, that's a threat there, Keith.  He doesn't think you could, you know, catch him.  All right, so cream pie.  Yes.  What does that say?  So what got you all nervous, though?  It started off okay.  Yeah, and I don't know.  You kind of said, make cumsy in the pants. 
[02:39:00]  So what's wrong with that?  I don't know.  Were you afraid you would cum in your pants or you wouldn't be able to?  I wouldn't be able to.  Okay, well, not money.  That's a good sign.  That's fine.  We thought it would be hilarious if you came in your pants.  Yeah, I thought that would be funny, too, but I just couldn't do it.  Have you had the occasional erection difficulty?  No.  Okay, so why would you be nervous?  So what if it happens?  I don't know.  Do you feel like you let the show down?  I heard that a few times.  Yeah, to a certain extent, yeah.  Well, you got another shot today because we got Brie Olson, another porn star here. 
[02:39:30]  You know that.  You know you have another shot at not letting the show down.  And what happened afterwards?  You started throwing immediately?  Throwing up immediately?  I went to the bathroom.  I just wasn't feeling well.  Yeah.  My name is Tippy Tom.  Back to Tippy.  Hold on a second.  What I'm saying is I'm having a good time.  How did he find a mic, Sam?  He didn't work for the show.  What I'm saying is that I'm having a good time, and you tell Keith that I will not deal  with him with his bad behavior. 
[02:40:00]  Okay?  I'm having a good time.  That's right.  It's Keith's job to find Tippy Tom every time.  He was a juvenile delinquent, and now he growed up a little bit, but he was a bad boy, and  he's a good guy now, though.  But still.  Hey, Tom.  But he's over weight.  He's got to lose 10 pounds.  You're saying Keith's overweight.  10 pounds.  He just told Steve he also needed to lose 10 pounds.  Yeah, that's generous. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, that's generous.  Who's that, Opie?  Yeah.  What are you doing over there, Opie?  I'm trying to, like, fucking control the festivities here today.  Just sitting around?  This is what I want you to do.  We want to give you the best seat in the house.  Sam, give him the middle of the bleachers, please.  Yes.  The middle of the bleachers for Tippy Tom.  Make way for Tippy Tom.  Move over.  Tippy Tom's going to sit down and enjoy the show.  Up top there, Sam, on the second, maybe third row for Tippy Tom. 
[02:41:00]  Right in the dead middle.  You're running the show, Tippy.  There you go.  Sit down.  All right.  They're not happy.  He's hogging on the street.  How does he smell?  Terrible.  They all have, like, face masks on.  Where do they get the face masks?  All right, Sam, get the mic away from.  We're almost done with cream pie.  So, cream pie.  Yes.  You started puking when, then?  Maybe a few minutes after.  Like, I went out and was trying to hold my faculties together. 
[02:41:30]  And then I went to the bathroom and just...  But it was a naked girl.  How does a naked girl get a guy to puke?  I don't know.  It was kind of...  I don't know.  Are you a shy boy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you had sex with a lot of girls?  Yeah.  Okay.  How many?  Double digits.  Last time you got laid.  No message boards, just counting.  What was the girl...  Two months ago.  What was the girl the last... 
[02:42:00]  The girl's name of...  What was the girl's name?  Nina.  It's still shit.  That was her name.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You haven't gotten laid.  He just made that...  I know.  No, that was her name.  He almost said Pinto or Santa Maria.  I study facial, you know.  You were so lying.  Nina.  No.  Yeah, that was her name, I think.  Yeah.  Nina.  I kind of don't want to remember her.  She's kind of fucking bitch.  All right.  So, if Brie Olsen's up for it, are you willing to, like, try this again? 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  And will you disappoint again?  I hope not.  Hey, guys, you want to see Cream Pie Jones make Cumzies in his pants?  Yeah!  All right, Cream Pie.  Here's your choice.  Cumzies in your pants, or Dr. Steve will give you an examination.  One could make the other happen.  Right.  I'll take choice A. 
[02:43:00]  What's that?  Cumzies?  Cumzies in the pants.  Do you want to try Cumzies in the pants right now, Jimmy?  Well, I would like him to try it.  Well, yeah, sure.  Sure.  All right.  Let's get Brie Olsen in here.  Or should we take a break?  How about we take a break?  I want to piss.  Yeah, we want to take leaks, regroup.  So, here's what we got.  We got Tippi Tom, obviously.  We got Brie Olsen, the porn star here.  We got Cream Pie Jones.  He's going to make Cumzies in his pants.  We got the great Dr. Steve here.  He's going to be sticking fingers in half these guys' asses by the end of the show. 
[02:43:30]  What?  And Big A.  Big A is here.  Is he here yet?  Yeah, he is.  All right.  We got to introduce Big A to the crowd after the break as well.  Opie and Anthony, and of course, Jim Norton.  Stay there.  You want to hear a song?  Yeah, let's hear a little tune.  All right.  Give me time.  The best song.  Hey!  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey!  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey!  Pull your bass down, man.  Let me see your ass.  Hey!  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey!  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey!

[02:44:30]  That's real ass.  Oh!  Oh!  God!  Oh!  That's the best ass I've ever...  My God!  Pull me back.  I'm an ass, ma'am.  Are you ready?  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony shoot.  We've got a huge crowd here at XM today.  The lovely Brie Olsen has joined the festivity.  She's sitting at the big table here.  We've got Dr. Steve at the table. 
[02:45:00]  We've got Tippi Tom wandering around out there and bothering people.  Yeah!  Hold on.  That mic's not on.  Why does the mic work sometimes and then other times it doesn't?  Well, what is it that you're trying to say?  I was just saying hi to you, Tippi.  Oh!  You're saying hello?  Yeah.  Well, hello to you, too.  All right.  Hey.  I got an idea, Tippi.  How you doing?  I got this idea.  It might be a little crazy.  I don't know.  But Anthony had to leave the show early today.  He's going down to the Bahamas with Joe Michelini. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, that's good news!  Why don't you come on in here, Tippi?  Come on in, Tippi.  Come on in.  Tippi.  Tippi, I want you.  This is great news.  I want you to sit in Anthony's chair in a big, comfy chair.  Make yourself comfortable, Tippi. 
[02:46:00]  I feel like talking.  Let's hear it for Tippi Tom sitting in Anthony's chair.  Yep.  There you go.  You're right, Anthony.  It's the Tippi.  I'm all cleaned up just for you.  Tippi, it's the Opie and Tippi Tom show.  Beautiful.  Here you go.  Oh, there's your mic.  Hey, what can try out some of your questions? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, Tippi.  Hey, it's my new song.  Wait, play that whistle for everybody.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  I'm going to get it right.  There you go.  There you go.  Tippi Tom.  Sitting in Anthony's seat.  Why don't you try some of the other stuff out, Tippi?  Why don't you try some of the other stuff out, Tippi?  Why don't you try some of the other stuff out?  You are a song. 
[02:47:00]  What do you think?  What do you think of the horn there, Tippi?  I can play anything like you've got.  Yeah?  I'm a musician.  Why don't you try some of the buttons over there?  Just push some of the buttons over there.  What button do you want to put?  Whatever one you want.  It's you, Tom.  All right, one.  Don't you try.  Is that enough?  No, keep going.  I got no one up to the top.  All right, two.  Hold on, hold on, Tom.  One at a time.  I'm trying to do it.  I'm going to do it. 
[02:47:30]  Two at a time.  Okay, three.  Four.  Four.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, mid-friend.  As far as I go, I'm up ten.  I don't care how many Dago, Getty, Wolf, Priest, Paul, Kumbach.  Come on, I don't know what it works.  Oh, here's the one there.  Hey, try the bell there, Tom.  Try the bell. 
[02:48:00]  Hold on.  How come Tom doesn't have headphones on?  Oh, Tom, do you want headphones on?  He was having a spray.  Tom should put those headphones on.  He don't need spray.  Put the headphones on.  Talk to somebody.  All right, why don't you put the headphones on?  There you go.  Oh, what's in here?  Yeah, try that.  Try blowing into that.  Yeah, that's funny.  There you go.  Oh, look, it's Anthony on line three.  Hey, wait, Tom.  Tom.  Take this next call through the bullhorn. 
[02:48:30]  Hey, Tom.  I like the bullhorn.  Yeah, give him the bullhorn.  Here, try the bullhorn out there, Tom.  Well, yeah.  Wait, over there.  Right there.  That's a goddamn good idea.  Right here.  I know that.  What I'm saying is this.  Push the button, Tom.  Here we go.  Yeah, go ahead.  Push it in and talk.  All right, now.  What I'm saying is that I like the bullhorn,  and I don't see no bullhorns around here. 
[02:49:00]  There's no buffalo over here either.  I'm tired of all this New York City.  Hey, Tom.  No buffalo, no.  Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.  What?  Focus, focus.  Grab the mic.  Put the bullhorn down.  Now take the next call for us, okay?  All right, who's calling?  No, just go, hi, who's this?  Go ahead.  Say it.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, who's this?  Get that animal out of my house. 
[02:49:30]  Get that animal out of my house.  No.  The animal's not here now.  I will not, I will not use any of those things again.  I want everything disinfected, the entire side of the studio, and I will not sit in that  I will buy it.  I will buy it.  You're out of business now, buddy. 
[02:50:00]  You're fired.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What I don't understand is why he ain't playing no rock and roll around.  I knew this was going to happen, too.  I knew it.  I'm like, the second I left, I'm like, why haven't they sat him in my seat?  I know these scumbags are going to do that.  He's having a ball over there.  He's touching everything.  Well, yeah.  Tom, don't put your mic, your mouth is not far enough. 
[02:50:30]  You have to move your mouth closer to the microphone.  Yeah, you got to get closer to the mic so he can hear you.  Get closer to the mic, Tom.  He can't hear you.  I got the headphones on.  Yeah, but get closer to the mic.  His lips are touching it.  Now I know everything I can't use anymore.  The mic, I'm taking the mic off and throwing it in the garbage.  Is your name Mike?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Where you been, Mike?  I'm hearing fucking think bombs.  You might think about getting rid of the chair, too.  You started pissing me off, Mike.  The chair's going to be gone.  Yeah.  When I get pissed off, I turn into the Hulk. 
[02:51:00]  And I swear to God, I will come after you.  He is turning into the Hulk.  Look at his legs are green.  Well, have fun with Tippi Tom.  I'm going to go to the Bahamas.  Hey, Tom.  Take away everything in that studio.  Can I go?  You want to go to the Bahamas with me?  Yeah, why not?  Wouldn't that be great?  I could just ditch him there and have him switch out. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  And you get to enjoy my company.  Hey, Tom.  It's hard to...  It's hard to...  What?  You have to adjust the Paltor cameras with that handle right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I want to...  Nobody can see.  Jesus.  What about that?  Let my spray alone.  No, get rid of that.  He's even touching the scent things.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, what's this for here?  You get nothing.  You lose. 
[02:52:00]  Good day, sir.  Somehow, his sound effects are very appropriate.  Are you ready?  That was Rocky Pitcher Horror Show.  Well, have fun with that stinky motherfucker.  I got to go.  Where are you going?  And I knew this was going to happen.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Go fuck yourself.  Thank you.  There you go.  There's Anthony on his way to the Bahamas.  That's not nice.  Yeah.  That was very...  Uncalled for. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, that was very wrong of you to hurt my feelings, man.  I actually feel sorry for Ronnie, because Ronnie has to sit in that seat at noon today.  All right, Tippy.  Why don't you go get a beer?  There you go.  Well, yeah, I want to get a beer.  Where's the beer?  Well, they're going to show you where the beer is.  Tippy Tom sitting in Anthony's seat.  I'm all hooked up here.  Yeah, get him over there to enjoy a beer.  Take my horn.  Yes.  Take the horn. 
[02:53:00]  Tippy.  Have fun with it.  Oh, I got the beer here, man.  We have to sit over there.  Yeah, go ahead.  Damn, I was having fun.  All right, Tippy.  We'll get you back in a minute or two.  Go have a beer.  All right.  We're going outside.  You earned yourself a beer, my friend.  We're going outside.  We're going out of bleachers.  So, Brie.  Hey, Brie.  Are you horrified?  Oh, my goodness.  What's wrong?  Now you've seen it all, right? 
[02:53:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  It's a little gamey.  Huh?  A little gamey.  Spray some of that in the air over here.  I'm dying.  I'm dying.  Oh, my God.  You didn't like that?  You know what?  Like, two girls, one cup didn't even gross me out, but that's something else.  That grossed you out right there?  Yeah.  We have, uh...  Where's Cream Pie Jones?  Ah, geek, get out of here!  Get out of here!  Where's Cream Pie?  Here's Cream Pie Jones. 
[02:54:00]  Ooh!  Yeah, this is, uh, Cream Pie Jones.  Yeah, I'm sitting at the feet.  I, uh, I want...  Closer.  Cream Pie.  What are we, queer?  I'm gonna buy this.  I'm not you.  Put...  Eric, pull that chair.  He just said yes.  E-Rock, bring the other chair closer.  I'm gonna get a lap dance in that chair.  Yeah.  All right.  Get...  Sit down there.  All right.  This is Cream Pie Jones, Brie.  Brie Olsen in studio.  The beautiful Brie Olsen.  Uh, Cream Pie, why don't you tell Brie what happened to you a mere couple days ago?  Um, do you know who Lisa Sparks is? 
[02:54:30]  No.  Not so much.  Well, uh, she was in studio, and, uh, they thought it would be a good idea, because it  was my 21st birthday, uh, two days ago, to, uh...  Aw.  Give me a special present, and, uh, they wanted me to make cumzies in my pants.  But, uh, unfortunately, I couldn't rise to the occasion.  I got nervous and threw up.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:55:00]  I swear to God.  Wow.  So, we're hoping that we could get something together here, because he wants to redeem  himself.  He felt like he let the show down.  Yeah.  Yes.  So, what did that guy say?  Tom, I think, said something about the best.  Oh, really?  And, uh, Cream Pie, are you nervous again?  No, I'm fine.  You're fine today?  Are you attracted to Brie?  Oh, yeah.  She's lovely, isn't she?  Definitely.  Do you like her better than Lisa?  Yes.  You should. 
[02:55:30]  Nothing against Lisa, but you really should like Brie.  Aw.  A bit better.  I can't help myself.  A lot better.  Yeah.  A lot better, right?  Yeah.  What was the problem with Lisa?  I don't know.  This is disgusting.  I'm real big.  She was disgusting, or you were just disgusted?  I was kind of just disgusted.  You didn't like the other?  A little bit of a...  Who is Lisa?  She has a gangbang record, like 900 and something.  919 or something like that.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know.  I'm hoping we could, like, do something for Cream Pie Jones today. 
[02:56:00]  Is that possible, Brie?  Okay.  What do you want me to do?  What a trooper.  Well, comesies in the pants would be hilarious.  That's probably...  Yeah.  How are we going to achieve that?  Well, as a birthday gift for him, they kind of wanted you to fuck Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'll be right on that.  It'll go telepathically to him.  I have a suggestion for the listeners out there.  If Cream Pie Jones makes comesies in his pants, everyone comes inside. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah!  Everyone!  Except Tom!  Except Tom?  What should I say?  Huh?  That's not nice.  I know.  Look, man, I want to come back indoors.  I'm outdoors now.  How about we hear it for...  How about we...  A little chant here.  Cream Pie.  Shoot it again!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Well, what do you want me to do?  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie! 
[02:57:00]  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Cream Pie!  Hey!  Hey!  Can I get a lap dancing?  Can I just blow him or something?  Can I just blow him?  Well, what a fucking...  Jesus.  Woo!  Well, how about we get you comfortable?  Can we turn down the lights a little bit for Brie Olsen?  Can we get a song on for you?  Oh, there's a good mood.  Much sexier.  Can we get a...  I'm not good at dancing.  I'm good at fucking.  No, I understand that, but just some kind of song that you like, that's all.  Oh, okay.  We're not expecting moves.  So, what am I going to do? 
[02:57:30]  Just kind of rub on him and maybe your thong or something like that, you know.  Can I just, like, unzip his pounce right now and just go to it?  Okay.  You can do whatever.  I don't know if he wants you to blow him, but...  What do you think, Cream Pie?  What's up, Cream Pie?  It's awesome.  What?  It's awesome.  What do you want me to do, baby?  No idea.  Yeah, you got to...  I've lost the words.  I'm sorry.  Talk to him.  What do you want her to do?  Yeah, talk to the Brie Olsen.  Beautiful.  All right, give me that.  She is, uh, rubbing...  Thank you so bad.  Oh, okay. 
[02:58:00]  You're doing my money.  I'm going to shut the fuck up.  Rubble it all up.  Trying to hold back and feel it.  She's, uh, she's kind of working on, uh, Cream Pie Jones' jeans.  Fuck.  I got you.  Come on.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Let's get dark.  Is that fine?  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:58:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Danny, what's going on over there?  She's rubbing his cock and showing her breasts.  I hate him right now.  Cream Pie, you want to see your boobies?  You're up.  Yes, please.  I love you.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, she's like, I love you.  Oh, she's like, I love you.  Jesus.  Cream Pie can't look at her.  Look at her, Cream Pie.  Look at her.  Oh, my God.  It's so good. 
[02:59:00]  I love you squeeze up in natural titties.  I'm nice and sand, Cream Pie.  Come on, now.  Fuck, son.  Fuck, do it.  Enjoy.  Oh.  My pussy's getting wet for you.  Hmm.  Let me see you.  Let me see your pop.  Oh, shit.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Hit the horn.  Oh, she's flowers with us.  Hit the horn, Tom.  Oh, shit. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, I like my dick.  Oh, my God.  You're getting hard for me.  Getting all ready.  Mmm.  Oh, I love it.  It's gonna be a tight little pussy.  I'd love to climb on top of you right now.  Mmm.  Mmm.  What are we doing, bro?  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  You've got a girl's ass before?  Yeah, I want.  Yeah?  You want to see what you can? 
[03:00:00]  Sure.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Give me a pink sock.  Boo.  Yes, dude.  E-Rock, what's going on?  He's grabbing him like he's, like, three years old.  I'm sorry.  Like they're gonna fall off.  Why don't you show me how to go?  I can.  I could.  I love it, baby. 
[03:00:30]  Show.  You can grab him like you're three years old all my life.  E-Rock, ask her if there's anything going on now.  Let's just stood up.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, lift it up.  Yeah, lift it.  Feel it.  Fuck, yeah.  Creepi is lifting up her dress.  Oh, yes.  Just attempted to spank her butt.  Oh, God. 
[03:01:00]  He's kind of spanking her.  Is there anything going on down there?  Hey, Brie, is there anything going on down there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sexy, man.  I love it.  You're so cute.  Let's go do it.  He's rubbing her boobs in his face.  All right, let's go.  All right, let's go. 
[03:01:30]  Where are they going?  I don't know.  Take her to the Rana Fez on the side.  Do you want to?  Yeah, we could bring him in the office like we did yesterday with Pat if you want.  I'll supervise.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy's going to do it.  What are we doing now?  Do I get some?  Jimmy will walk you through it.  Yes.  Why don't you grab a mic there?  Okay.  Jimmy grabs the mic.  Do I have headphones?  I think Jimmy might be a cussies in his pants.  No.  Jimmy's only going to watch.  How about headphones, Iraq? 
[03:02:00]  Big fat body turning around in circles.  You guys, let's hear it for Brie Olsen.  Great job for us today.  Jimmy's going to take Brie and Pre-Pie Jones into the Rana Fez office.  Who had this in their dirty ears?  He's just giving me this thing that was stuck in somebody's ear.  Yeah.  It'll be all right.  No?  I'm confused.  Where are we going?  There's a little office back here.  We could give him a good lap dance there.  Yeah, Brie Olsen is, well, Pre-Pie Jones is kind of like just staggering toward the Rana Fez office. 
[03:02:30]  Jimmy, can you hear me, Jimmy?  Yes, I can.  All right, Jimmy is...  Hi, Eastside Dave.  Eastside Dave.  Jimmy, what's going on?  You going to the Rana Fez office?  No, it's just me.  They're sitting down, all right, and...  I don't know.  He's closing the door right now.  He's very shocked.  I'm very quiet.  Okay.  I don't want to kill the door. 
[03:03:00]  Don't even pay attention to me.  I'm just talking.  They're looking at me.  She's like, what are you supposed to be doing?  He's just relaxing.  He's afraid I'm going to see his penis, so he's turning around.  And it looks to me like his pants are coming down a little bit.  Okay.  And it looks like Brie is taking his penis out.  Or maybe it's still in his underwear. 
[03:03:30]  I can't tell.  Okay.  I'm very jealous.  I want to suck his dick.  Oh, my God.  Don't worry.  He's looking over his shoulder at me.  Fantasizing.  For approval or something?  What is he doing?  I think he's nervous.  Of course he's nervous.  He's going to puke again.  She's squeezing his hiney.  And rubbing his penis, I think, through his underpants. 
[03:04:00]  Okay.  She's a lovely girl.  And he doesn't look very comfortable.  Did you ever see somebody's face when the FBI takes their hard drive?  It's kind of like that face.  Okay.  She's so fucking hot.  Jimmy, as you do the play-by-play, can we have Eastside Dave do the color commentary? 
[03:04:30]  I think Eastside Dave may damage the mood a little bit.  I'm just thinking two sportscasters on the scene.  Well, I can't recall Howard Cosell ever having a brand mark on his asshole.  And it looks to me like she's just kind of rubbing his crotch a little bit.  Okay.  There's nothing too heavy.  I'm going to take a peek over his shoulder.  All right.  She's touching his penis through his pants. 
[03:05:00]  He has a full erection.  There'll be two kids on a date.  Actually, they're like one teenager and one awkward rapist.  Jimmy, a lot of people are betting that you're going to make commsies before Cream Pie Jones does.  A lot of people might be doing very well to win that bet.  Yeah.  We might be losing Jimmy's mic.  That's because Jimmy's mic is crackling. 
[03:05:30]  Can you guys hear me now?  I'm sorry.  The door's locked from the inside.  Oh, the door's locked from the inside.  Jimmy, I might have to open the door so we can switch bikes.  No, no.  I'm okay now.  Okay.  All right.  She's so fucking hot.  Yeah.  She's riding his lap right now.  Yeah.  And he's sucking her big, beautiful breasts.  Yeah.  Let's hear the sounds of the sport.  I keep sucking my titty.  Oh, shit. 
[03:06:00]  God, I'm such a whore.  She just read everybody's mind.  Do it.  Do it.  What are you?  Do it.  Do what, Jimmy?  Do what?  She wants him to stand over her chest and do something on her breasts. 
[03:06:30]  Are you kidding?  No.  Because it's the same thing that I've wanted to do on her breasts.  Yeah.  Or on anybody's breasts right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we get a word from Cream Pie?  I don't think he'll talk.  Okay.  He's staring there awkward.  Yeah.  I've never seen an unsexier pose in my life.  No.  He's so shy.  I think he thinks that he's the important one in this scenario.  But no one's looking at him. 
[03:07:00]  It's fucking horrible.  All right.  Let's go back to the action.  What action?  And I can't see anything but his big dumb back.  Fucking Samuel the shy sealant.  Yeah.  I want to start screaming, blood-curdling voice just to kill his fucking 21-year-old rod.  Fuck him.  Does he look nervous?  He's jerking off on her tits.  He's a good boy.  He's a...  No, no.  He's being okay.  He's doing exactly what I would do.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  It's very sexy.  Have her talk.  Jimmy, the...  She can't talk right now.  The listeners are begging for a word or two from...  From Breals.  Um, she won't say anything, but the sounds...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-mm.  She can't talk right now.  Do you have anything to say, Brie?  Mm-mm.  Oh, boy.  I've never wanted to be him before. 
[03:08:00]  Wow, he's even got the hand on the head.  This fucking kid adjusts quickly.  Okay.  What's happening to you?  Did you?  I heard something.  Oh, my God.  Do you know what?  I'd still kiss her.  Um...  I'm kidding, fucks.  What happened?  Uh, it looks to me like fucking cream pie. 
[03:08:30]  He kind of did, but why am I still whispering?  He...  I think he made the cumzies.  Yeah.  But there's no evidence due to the fact that Brie is what you call a good egg.  Uh, Brie Olsen making her way back into the studio to a standing ovation, by the way.  Standing ovation.  How was it?  For Brie Olsen and cream pie.  Let it be known, cream pie, uh, cream pie Jones has redeemed himself today. 
[03:09:00]  Can I tell you?  It was, uh...  She's so sexy, because she's rubbing on him, and I tried not to kill the mood as much as possible.  I tried to stay back, and he was fucking...  You did a good job.  Yeah, I had to hang back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, and, uh, all of a sudden he stands up, and he's just tugging a little.  Yeah.  It looks like he was tugging, maybe with his underwear on.  And, uh, her big natural bosoms were exposed.  Yeah.  And then, uh, she tried to talk, but couldn't.  Yeah, what got to you there, cream pie?  The big boobies?  Yeah.  Yeah?  She's a goddess, so... 
[03:09:30]  I can't hear him, by the way.  What's that?  Turn on.  Why don't we spend half our show going?  I can't hear him.  Is it on?  All right.  Cream pie?  She's a goddess, so...  She's a goddess.  That was kind of sexy.  Look, I gotta be honest.  Watching, uh...  Watching, uh...  Good old cream pie.  Watching Brie give, uh, what is arguably the best birthday gift ever given to a boy.  Yes, thank you.  Aw.  Thank you.  Fucking 21st birthday.  My fucking mother bought me a trapper keeper because I was going to community college. 
[03:10:00]  I'm a sucker.  Wow.  Uh...  You're a good boy, cream pie.  We're very happy for you.  I try.  Thank you.  This is the best birthday present ever.  Yeah, I know.  It's really tough being you.  Uh, gee.  I had to shoot a load in a porn star's mouth.  Poor me.  Tough being you, kid.  Doesn't wear a doody hat.  All right.  Fair enough.  I'd live in a shit house if I could get that.  Wow.  She's fucking so sexy.  Oh, my...  I can't tell you.  It was so hot to watch that.  As an addict?  Are you just out of your mind right now? 
[03:10:30]  As a fucking...  As a human being.  That would not be out of my mind.  If I was a nun, I'd be teasing my clit.  Yelling, fuck the Lord.  Wow.  That was really sexy.  Cream pie, any final thoughts?  Wow.  Sorry.  Just a wow?  Yeah.  And you redeemed yourself.  Are you going to go puke now?  No.  Now, could you see yourself...  Honestly, now, did you feel any type of connection with her?  Because she was very...  It seemed like she was kind of...  She's a very nice girl.  Aw, you're nice, too, baby.  Thank you.  You're not going to follow her now, are you? 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Don't worry about that stuff.  You're going to go home and go to sleep?  Yeah.  It's funny.  It's going to count Brie's.  Let's hear it for Brie Olsen, everyone.  Thanks.  Thanks.  What do you got?  We can meet Brie Olsen along with Penthouse Pets, Victoria, a bunch of other...  Oh, Dr. Z from our show.  Dr. Z and Justin Jolie.  Oh, yeah.  We like Justin.

Can we get the Brie Olsen plugs in again there, Jimmy?  Yeah.  She's going to be appearing...  Oh, wait, wait.  Before you do that, you guys want her to do the rest of the show topless?  I don't know.  Yeah!  Sure, why not?  I've got to be honest. 
[03:13:30]  Her breasts are...  It's almost like you can't even talk about them.  You just look at them and go...  They're beautiful.  They're very beautiful, natural.  Yeah.  Just...  And you can meet her tonight, along with a friend of ours as well, Dr. Z.  Victoria, Victoria Zdrock, and Justine Jolie, who we love.  They're going to be at the nightcap video on Staten Island.

You never know what I'll do.  Oh, my God.  Do you have a website, Brie?  Yeah, BrieAlson.com.  Yeah, a lot of people on Instant Feedback are checking out the website right now.  And they made comesies in their pants, too.  Yeah.  And for some reason, they need to tell me.  I don't know why, but...  Because we get girls in here that just talk a good game.  And I'm telling you, I watched it. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  And, wow, I've never seen 4 1⁄2 inches disappear so quickly.  Since birthday, I gave the kid an inch.  I noticed another celebrity in the studio today, and I want nothing but respect for the next person I introduce you to.  Ladies and gentlemen, E-Rock's father right there sitting down.  E-Rock's father.  E-Rock's father. 
[03:15:00]  Now that he's very embarrassed, we've got to bring Roland...  Oh, my God.  Ladies and gentlemen, if the show couldn't get better, this is Is Time Alive?  I swear to God.  Oh!  Just in case you thought we were bullshitting, look at this guy.  Nice intro.  Hey, Tom, I'm going to take you to Central Park for some sun after this show. 
[03:15:30]  I'll probably die.  All right, Tom.  So, we didn't know you were stopping by today.  Well, I heard Dr. Steve was...  And, once again, the mic doesn't work, so hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  We'll get your mic.  Wireless?  Why don't we just use the one with the wire on it?  Yeah.  Mr. Dr. Steve.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Good.  Nice to meet you.  Good to meet you.  Dr. Steve was very important in this whole damn thing with Tom from White Place. 
[03:16:00]  Different Tom.  Yes, yes, yes.  He talked to you, right?  Huh?  You can call me TJ if that's easier.  TJ?  Yeah.  TJ in the house.  And, Dr. Steve gave you some hope, right?  Yeah.  And, you sent me a couple emails and a couple phone calls, which I couldn't return for reasons.  I got in my control.  Right, right.  Yeah, for Brie Olson, this guy tried to kill himself on our show last week.  Wait, wait, wait.  I swear to God.  You both have got hands. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, it's clean.  Okay.  Yeah, it's clean.  I was listening on the way in.  Yeah, I figured my own rear with it.  Yeah.  Hey, we want to give you some inspiration for not killing yourself anytime soon.  Look at those boobies.  Hey, baby.  Yes, that's it.  Nice view.  I grew these for you.  It's coming in.  If you kill yourself, you're not going to have this visual.  Exactly.  You get to miss being rejected by this.  Exactly. 
[03:17:00]  But thanks.  I didn't want to make a big deal.  I just wanted to catch Dr. Steve before he left and say hello to you guys.  Why don't we give him a seat, man?  Why don't you sit down, Tom?  Is there another?  There you go.  I say he can sit there.  Tom wasn't sitting there, was he?  Who?  We got Tom sitting down there to enjoy the rest of the show.  There you go.  He went from trying to.  How about we get our guests some water?  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[03:17:30]  You're not thirsty?  And maybe a tanning bed.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, tan doesn't come very easily to me.  Yeah.  I understand.  Where do you vacation?  Neptune?  Mighty Tom.  I've got to go after Uranus.  Hey, he's waiting a minute.  Hey, he's dying.  Give him a little something.  Were you great on a curve for Christ's sake?  He used that line last week.  Huh?  He used that line last week.  It's all right.  He didn't think he'd be around to use it again.  Yeah, he looks great on a curve. 
[03:18:00]  Anything Tom says is funny, right, guys?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't need pity.  Thank you.  You sound better, though, man.  You sound a little healthier and happier.  You sound like a little more upbeat.  It's good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We were very concerned, Tom.  I was a few blocks away.  I was, like, trying to hail a cab to get him in the parking spot to hear.  Yeah.  Well, it's tough.  You know, black people and translucence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all good to see me. 
[03:18:30]  Hey, we've got a couple more people we want to introduce.  We should just go get a keg, man, at this point.  I didn't know we were going to.  What a goddamn party going on here.  I can't really drink, though, but.  Why not?  What are you, a pussy?  I feel like crap in the next one.  Ah, just drink and fire your guns in the air.  Fuck it.  All right.  You guys want to see Roland?  Where's Roland?  Yeah, bring out Roland.  All right.  Roland's coming into the studio. 
[03:19:00]  It'll be hot in here.  Here's Roland, everyone.  Roland.  Roland, if you could stand in front of all the people.  We would like you to give a synopsis of the new Mike.  I actually want Bree to do it, because I think that would be.  Roland, talk about what the Mike Myers people said.  After the interview.  And Bree, if you would just humor us.  Could you just go up and tickle him while he's talking?  Tickle him?  They had a really good time, and they...  Wait.  You can't do it too hard. 
[03:19:30]  They had a really good time, and they were like...  To come back.  Let's go.  Look, I...  They had a really good time. 
[03:20:00]  And I swear to you, Bree, that's the real deal.  He's not putting it on for the show.  For some reason, he's extremely ticklish.  Yeah.  Myers tickled me in the dressing room.  He tickled you in the dressing room?  Because his publicist goes, yeah, I heard he has a word.  And he did it.  Yeah.  He goes, okay.  You want a Bree Olsen motorboat, Roland?  What's a motorboat?  You know.  Yeah.  What do you say, Roland?  I don't know. 
[03:20:30]  You want it?  Just, look, just put your head in there and...  Oh.  Get in there.  Get in there, Roland.  Just pretend they're balls.  I'm all the tough.  So there you go.  You know who could use a motorboat?  I mean, if you don't mind, Bree.  Who?  Our friend's been a little sad lately.  He's doing better.  But I think that Tom deserves a motorboat.  I would love to. 
[03:21:00]  Tom's going to be getting it.  Tom, sit down.  Please.  Yes.  You only have a few breaths left.  Don't stand up.  I know.  You're big enough to hang down anyway.  And the fact that you're dressed like Ernest goes to camp is irrelevant.  You got to move your hat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Wait, he's doing it right.  Get a mic on him.  This is how you do a motorboat.  Good job.  Thank you.  The irony, if that shocked him so much, he just grabbed his chest. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Well, if he's going to go, that's a hell of a way to go.  She's fantastic, isn't she?  Yeah.  She's a trooper.  A metabot troll.  Bree Olson.com.  Bree Olson.com.  Would you like to just work the crowd with a couple of motorboats?  You know, I would do that.  Yes.  Yes.  Bree Olson's going to work the crowd.  Who wants a motorboat?  Everybody just raise their hand.  We're going to be here until noon.  Bree.  Bree.  Bree.  Let's go right here.  All right. 
[03:22:00]  Bree Olson working the crowd.  She's not big.  Woo!  Yeah.  All we ask is you make the noise for everybody out there.  Radio land.  Oh, look at the creep waiting for his motorboat.  What a fucking creepy motor...  Oh, I got scared.  I got denied.  Oh, no.  I got denied.  Hey, how did Bowser from Sean Anah get his fucking motorboat hit?  Whoa.  Go for it.  Yeah.  All right.  A girl just did a motorboat. 
[03:22:30]  Really?  I love it.  Yeah.  All right.  We got...  I think we got one more.  All right.  That was the fucking...  Bree, could you do one more?  Because Danny Zuko didn't get his motorboat.  And you kind of skipped over the kid.  He's a good boy.  Be nice to him.  Have a one for Jimmy.  Have a one for Jimmy.  No.  After five guys just motorboated.  No.  Hey, Jimmy.  What? 
[03:23:00]  I think it's only fair that E-Rock's dad gets a motorboat.  Yeah.  What?  What happened?  I'm a home man.  You want to kill me?  What do you say?  Are you a trooper?  No.  What?  Oh, look at E-Rock.  No.  Bobby's going to be bad.  There you go.  E-Rock is a cock blocker.  No, no.  I tell you what.  After you get one, I'll take two.  Oh, boy.  No, no.  Come on.  You know, he's a smart man.  You know, step up.  Step up.  Yeah, now he's...  Nah, I'm out.  Yeah.  I'm out.  E-Rock's dad. 
[03:23:30]  The coiner of the phrase, yeah, he's mine.  You know what?  He just...  No, he's not.  You know, E-Rock's dad just played me perfectly.  Bravo to you, sir.  Yeah.  He's...  All right.  Brie Olsen, everyone, doing motorbots.  Fantastic.  Now we've got Big A.  Big A.  Where's Big A coming in to the studio?  Big A. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, can I get in?  No.  No.  Here's Big A, everyone.  You have any words for the audience there, Big A?  Turn to the crowd and, you know, say something.  Wow.  How was that powdered donut?  Cool.  All right.  What was he doing?  Coke in the back?  Oh, we love Big A.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Big A.  I want to welcome everybody here to the Open Anthony show. 
[03:24:30]  I hope you have a good time.  All right.  That's good enough.  Hey, Big A.  Hey, Big A.  Well, actually, I've got to go to Jimmy.  Now, you know, if we were smart, we would just end the show right now, go home early,  because it was really hot and sexy.  And a great energy.  Yeah.  But now we're going to fuck it up, because we're going to have Dr. Steve sticking fingers  up the back of the guy's asshole.  That's right.  Oh, look at the time.  Dr. Steve, you're in town for your Saturday night virus, right?  That's right.  The great Dr. Steve. 
[03:25:00]  The great Dr. Steve.  He does a good radio show.  He's got a real radio voice, and he's a good friend, and he fucking knows what he's talking  about.  The great Dr. Steve secretly helping all members of the Open Anthony staff with their medical  problems.  The great Dr. Steve, winner of the creepiest fucking medical photographer.  Every picture taken of him, it looked like he should be the fucking angel of death somewhere  with like 30 old people smothered.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not very fun of Jack.  Guys, I don't know how this happened, but it's Dr. Steve's thing. 
[03:25:30]  Every time he comes to New York, he sticks fingers up guys' asses.  I don't really understand it myself.  You don't understand it?  He's a doctor, and we're faggots.  So we got some people here.  We got Big A.  Yep.  Big A, have you ever had your prostate checked?  I don't know.  No, no.  Wow.  You would know.  I think no.  You'd know.  We have to send a parakeet in first.  Make sure.  We have Big A.  Who else is... 
[03:26:00]  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom and Tippi Tom.  Big A, you're changing gloves, aren't you?  Yeah.  Good question.  You're changing gloves, Tom.  Yeah, of course.  Cool.  Big A, would you be willing to get your prostate checked real fast?  It's a healthy thing.  You got to do it anyway.  How old are you?  It's very important.  Absolutely old.  Isn't that Jimmy?  I'm going to do this.  It is a medical...  I say that we have to kind of have a little bit of privacy.  I got to say...  So maybe right here.  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  Facing the audience.  I got to say, it made Breals, it put a problem.  I'm thinking, I'm hearing all this.  I'm like, it might be time for me to go.  Oh, see what we do.  See what we do.  You're the only one keeping it from being totally gay.  That's true.  Can you imagine if she walks out and all of a sudden he takes his pants off all our dicks  get hard?  Yeah.  If he's doing prostate...  Sorry, Oak.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  If he's doing prostate exams with both hands on your hips, I'd be worried. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, that old joke.  Hey, hey, what did we say?  Sorry.  Actually, Bre does have to go.  People are telling us that.  Oh, gosh.  She's got other things to do.  I think she's done enough here.  You were great, Bre.  I love you guys.  And we loved you.  Thebrebrewison.com  Yes.  I hope I'll hit this one more time, too, because the Penthouse girls are great, man. 
[03:27:30]  They always come in here, and none of them are fucking having an attitude.  They're all really cool.  You can meet Bre tonight with Dr. Z, who we love, and Justine Jolie, who's also fantastic.  Nightcap video in Staten Island.  It's from 4 to 8 p.m.  And if you want our hot, just nasty, hardcore stuff, go to penthousestore.com or her own website.  Yeah.  But, you know, we love when you come in, so come back.  I love you.  I'd suck all your cocks all day.  Wow.  Fine.  I think that's an endorsement. 
[03:28:00]  I'm not sure, but there you go.  I love you guys.  All right.  All right.  Bre, we'll see you soon.  Bre, we'll see you soon, everyone.  Bye.  Standing low.  Standing low for the last one.  There you go.  There we go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let's get to the hotness.  Big A, drop your pants.  Come on, Big A.  Let's get that asshole out.  How are we going to do this?  Are we going to go?  Where are we going?  Over there?  I think, yeah, I think we should set up where Keith is right now and have Big A face the 
[03:28:30]  crowd and we could have Dr. Steve behind him, right by the wall.  You are correct.  What's with the gloves, Steve?  What are you, fucking pussying out?  What are you, what are you, amateur?  This was for Tom.  Yeah.  Look when they're barehanded.  I want to acknowledge the creepy guys that Dr. Steve brought with them today.  Oh, what a fucking motley collection of friends you have.  Is there a nerd convention in New York today? 
[03:29:00]  Fucking asshole.  What the fuck?  I know.  They had to come here because Trekkies were beating them up.  Why is he putting on a glove?  I know he's not a doctor.  I met him earlier.  This is P.A.  John.  Doesn't he own a tanning fucking business?  No, that's the other guy.  Oh, that's the other guy?  Who's this strange man?  Yeah.  This is P.A.  John.  He's my partner on Weird Medicine.  Oh, okay.  Hey, P.A.  John.  9 p.m.  Saturday on the Saturday Night Virus.  Correct.  Pema cult card with the developer to make sure he doesn't have rectal bleeding or anything 
[03:29:30]  that may need to be.  Laughed at it.  Farther.  And actually, if we, you know, if we get to Tom, and if we don't get to Tom, we're going  to take care of Tom after the show because I've got an appointment set up with him at  a clinic downtown, and they've agreed to see him after the show.  So, I mean, Tom probably doesn't pay a lot of attention to his, you know, health care.  Where's Tom?  Tippy.  Tippy Tom. 
[03:30:00]  Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  And so we're going to take care of him after the show if we don't get to him during the  show.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  We're actually starting to do the right thing with this goddamn radio show.  We know Tom needs to really be looked at.  Yeah.  He really does.  It's about time.  We're going to look at him.  All right.  Who's on your show?  So, Dr. Z is a guest on your show?  Yeah.  Dr. Z will be on.  She'll be answering sex questions, and she will actually be having a regular of this channel 
[03:30:30]  on to try to get him into a relationship by getting some advice from Dr. Z.  She has big nipples.  Excellent.  Look at him.  Excellent.  Yeah.  That works great on radio.  You know, you get...  Yeah.  That's a good point.  Your show gets great reviews.  Really?  In the Yoni community.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  They're going to love it tomorrow night.  Nine o'clock, right?  We, you know, we don't try to be funny.  The material ends up being funny, because it's amazing what people will not ask their regular  doctor, but are completely free to ask, you know, to us anonymously in front of the 
[03:31:00]  whole country.  Right.  We could do a few of those questions today.  Anyone have a question in the audience that...  Oh, Tom?  Oh, no.  Tom.  You don't have Dr. Laura come in at any time, do you?  No.  Please say no.  No.  Oh, what are they?  That's funny.  All the lines of the day.  Yeah.  Aren't you glad you changed your mind last week, Tom? 
[03:31:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Very much.  However, as the audience...  We really are.  All right.  Big A has to take a leak?  Yeah.  Why?  Are you going to run away?  No, no.  No.  Big A's a trooper.  He doesn't run.  He can't.  Actually, I tried before, but Tippi Tom was in the bathroom, and I was told I can't go  in.  Well, what happens with Tippi Tom, Danny, you want to explain how to get Keith involved?  Well, because what I've noticed with Tippi is that he'll drink, obviously, and then he  needs to relieve himself, but Tippi doesn't like to use urinals. 
[03:32:00]  Tippi likes the seat, so Tippi will get into a stall, he'll lock it, he'll sit down,  decide that he has to make a shit, and then after he shits, he decides he's nice and  comfortable and decides that he has to now take a nap with his pants down on the toilet.  So, there's been a few different occasions where we've had to wake Tippi Tom up on the  toilet bowl and get him motivated to pick his pants back up and come back into the studio,  because he was just taking a nap.  Unbelievable.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  You might have pissed off Tom.  That's my personal business, okay?  You understand that?  If I fall asleep on Tom bowl, that's my business.  That's right.  It's not your business.  Don't tell the world, either.  That's right.  Yeah, I do fall asleep on Tom bowl once in a while.  I took it back, Tippi.  Tippi Tom, do that.  All right, Tippi Tom, do that.  So, Big A needs to take a leak, so...  Yeah, fucking Tippi Tom's doing his hair like Ashton Kutcher now.  He looks like the guy from Oasis. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, I know.  He's fucking emo.  Should we do a quick break and then we do Big A's prostate?  We should.  If you want to do that, we could do that.  Really quick, though?  Sure.  All right, Big A, go leak, and then the grand finale is going to be Tippi Tom getting a  figure up the ass, by the way.  Andrew.  And tell his ass.  Oh.  I'm at my voucher.  All right, listen.  I'll pay that motherfucker.  You guys having a good time today?  Yeah.  The grand finale next.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  Opie! 
[03:33:30]  Anthony!  And Norton, too!  Good times, great hits!  XF-202!  Suck my fucking cock!  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:34:00]  Starring Jim Norton.  Jim Norton, everyone.  I didn't like your waning lack of enthusiasm.  That's all you got.  What the hell is that?  What was that noise?  Oh.  Oh, he wants to say something.  Oh.  He's going to make a proclamation.  Did we check him for guns today, by the way?  All right.  Tom is here for Miss Tom Alive Friday. 
[03:34:30]  We got Big A in the corner with Dr. Steve, and Big A's going to get his prostate examed.  That's right.  Examined.  So, Dr. Steve, take it away, man.  Ready?  Yeah.  We need something for Andrew to prop himself up on, because he's going to need to...  Do we have anything...  Freestanding prostate exam usually ends up in tragedy. 
[03:35:00]  It's the worst.  They give and they give, and we just take and turn.  Hey, by the way, people are editing their own Opie and Anthony show today.  They're all turning off the show and going to the music channels.  That's smart on their part.  Why?  They want the last thought in their heads being Brie Olsen and her fake boobies.  Not fake.  Real boobies.  Big, real boobies.  Juicy.  All right, Big A.  We got a... 
[03:35:30]  Wow.  We're going to be draping you with that shower curtain.  Are you nervous, Andrew?  How do you feel?  Let's talk to Ants Mike.  Yeah, I am a little nervous.  All right.  Well, it's part of...  I'm sorry.  I got it, Andrew.  What did you say?  Actually, I am a little nervous, yes.  Yeah.  Why?  What's going on?  You can pull the mic towards you a little bit.  What's making you nervous?  I'll have a finger up your ass. 
[03:36:00]  Well said.  All right, yeah.  Not a bright question.  No.  I know we're better than Howard Stern, Tom.  I've been saying that for 10 years.  I'm just fucking around.  Thank you, Tom.  All right, Big A.  You ready?  Your gum.  Put the gum out.  Put the gum out, Tom.  We didn't have Steve pull it out of his finger.  So what we'll be looking for is enlargement of the prostate, and we've also got a card here  for testing to see if there's any blood in his rear end.  And so, and this is a pretty common procedure that is done in, usually in middle, when you 
[03:36:30]  start to hit middle age or if you have symptoms.  And it's a real simple procedure.  It's relatively painless and just a little bit of discomfort.  And it's usually saved for the last, for the end of the physical exam because we save  the best for last.  Yeah, but Dr. Steve, more importantly, when did you get obsessed with assholes?  Because, you know, it started with this radio show.  And can I get a blocker? 
[03:37:00]  I really don't want to see that.  Everyone else is blocked.  Why am I not blocked from this?  Hey, I have a question, too.  What's the thing that you do to test for blood?  And shouldn't that just be you use a white glove?  Well, okay, that's an excellent question, Jim.  Yeah.  Actually, you can detect microscopic amounts of blood using this card because you can...  So how does it work?  There's a chemical in there that reacts to hemoglobin.  When we put the developer on there, it'll turn blue.  And you can detect just a few red blood cells, which you would not be able to see, so you 
[03:37:30]  can catch it before.  I mean, if you've got bright red blood pouring out of your ass, then, I mean, you know you've  got a problem.  And this is a way to catch it before it becomes a huge thing.  So he swipes with that little card?  Yeah.  Kind of like a purchase in a store.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I picked the worst time to start eating my blueberries.  I may find a few of those myself.  Yeah.  Okay, are you ready?  Yeah, here we go.  What you've got to do is drop your drawers, and then I need you to... 
[03:38:00]  I want a big cheer when Big A drops his drawers, you know.  You don't need to say that.  We're all going to do it instinctively.  Yeah.  And raise your hand if this makes comesies in your pants.  Andrew, what are you doing?  You're pulling them down.  Don't be so shy.  Let's get that dumper out.  You undoing your belt?  Oh, you've got to pull the belt down.  That's right.  Drop it.  Attaboy.  You dropped those pants.  All right.  Yeah.  Now, yeah, they've got to go down, too.  The underwear's got to come down, sweetie. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  And bend over the...  Bend over.  Hold on.  We've got to get the mic by Big A's mouth.  And, um, Big A...  For Ron and Fez, when the finger goes in, you've got to go Big A.  All right?  And hold on.  Take that...  Hold on.  There you go.  Someone...  Hold on.  Big A, mic by your mouth.  So I'll put that mic by Steve's mouth, so Steve can talk into that mic.  Oops.  I've got to move back, because I'm good with you.  As soon as the finger goes in, a nice Big A for Ron and Fez. 
[03:39:00]  There's my finger.  And...  Big A!  Big A!  All right.  Testing the, uh, fecal matter.  Ugh.  And then you've got the developer, John.  Yeah.  The developer.  How's the glove look, Steve?  It's, um...  It looks pretty normal.  Oh.  That's good news, Big A.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  Prostate wasn't enlarged.  Get a free appetizer at FH this weekend.  And the developer's going on.  Oh, the developer, Jimmy.  And, uh...  Very technical.  No, no blue, so no blood.  No blood!  You're good, man.  No blood!  What do you have to say, Big A?  You happy?  Yes, I am.  Ron and Fez don't do this for you.  Actually, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, really?  Thanks, Tomo.  You didn't hear you.  Big A went, two fingers.  Use two.  You guys can probably...  You can probably drop the...  Dr. Steve has a shit fist right now.  So, Steve, um...  Because I had, uh...  Um...  A sonogram done on my prostate.  Yeah.  Because I pissed so much.  So I thought I might have a problem. 
[03:40:30]  They, uh...  A sonogram would show if you have an enlarged prostate, right?  Because they showed a...  Oh, yeah.  And they said it looked pretty normal.  Oh, I like it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Now, the, um...  Sonogram's a little bit bigger than...  Than my finger is, though.  I can't...  Well, no, they did some kind of...  They did something through my stomach.  Oh, they did the...  Okay.  And they didn't do the transrectal sonogram.  No, I...  I asked.  You make it sound so sexy, Dr. Steve.  Yes.  Transrectal. 
[03:41:00]  That's from asshole across an ocean to another asshole.  Swimwalker.  You didn't get the transrectal.  You got a stand?  All right, Big A.  What are you hoping for?  A fucking sequel?  You got your ass checked.  Now beat it.  Who wants more?  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, once again, let's bring in Tippy Tom.  Yeah!  Tippy Tom, everybody.  He's drinking five-hour energy.  Is he?  Oh.  I need some more gloves. 
[03:41:30]  Big A's fisting was sponsored by Five-Hour Energy for the free product there.  Come on, I feel like...  Hooking the show up with some energy drinks for the passing crew.  That's Five-Hour Energy.  It wakes up your brain, gets you bright, alert, focused without the jitters or the crash later  in the day.  Five-Hour Energy.  You guys enjoyed the Five-Hour Energy game?  No, they're not cheering for you, Tom.  Bring them over there.  Tom raised his hand as the cheers started.  No, they're cheering Five-Hour Energy.  All right, well, it's too late. 
[03:42:00]  We've got to throw all this stuff away anyway, so fuck it.  All right, uh...  All right, Tippy Tom, I want to talk.  All right, Tippy, yeah.  I'm going to sit down now.  Tippy.  I guess on the...  Why are the doctors putting on all sorts of fucking biohazard gear?  I know.  Do you have a question for me, please?  Hold on, yeah.  When was the last time you saw a doctor, Tippy Tom?  About a thousand years ago.  When I was growing up.  Yeah.  And then, um...  Yeah, but that was about it.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to doctors and I don't like them. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Because I'll find out things that are wrong with you that aren't.  Tom, I've got to ask you something.  So I'm really not happy with doctors.  Have you been drilling for oil?  How much oil do I drink?  No, have you been drilling for oil?  You have fucking hands like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Oh, drilling for oil?  Right.  Oh, well, I do that all the time.  Yeah.  So, um, what else do you want to hear?  Tippy Tom, the doctor is going to examine you now, so you have to take your clothes off.  Yeah.  Oh, see my body? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, you've got to take your clothes off.  Again, take your clothes off.  Well...  Step out in front of the crowd.  That's going to cost them some money.  Well, step right over here.  That's going to cost...  No, they said no.  No, no, they didn't need no.  Go ahead.  Want some money?  Come on.  Well, yeah.  No, I'm on our radio.  Right here.  This is the...  Oh!  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the charity portion of the Opie Anthony show, where we pass around  a basket like we're in church.  What do you want to do?  Give.  Give to the homeless.  Give to the baby.  Take my clothes off. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, be sexy.  Take your clothes off and throw them like a stripper.  Wait a second.  All right, take your clothes off, Tom, for your exam.  Take your clothes off.  Throw your money, ladies and gentlemen.  Throw your money.  I'm not taking all my clothes off.  You've got to take it off for your exam.  Yeah.  Get your pants.  Well, where's the doctor at?  He's right there.  That's the doctor.  All right, all right.  Come on, come on.  Just...  All right.  You do this.  What are we doing? 
[03:44:00]  We're standing here.  Dr. Steve's keeping...  Dr. Steve's keeping it very professional.  He said, Tom doesn't have to take all his clothes off.  Get your hog away from me.  How is his penis next day?  Jimmy was...  Don't sprinkle them by me, E-Rock.  Jimmy was three feet from Jimmy's penis.  All right, get over here.  Tom, we're going to...  Yeah, I'm getting over here.  Tom, we're going to examine you.  Dr. Steve is a real doctor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom and I talked before the show. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  All right.  And he's cool with doing this on the air.  Am I sitting down or standing up?  We'll let you stand up.  You got to take your jacket off the top of it.  Take Anthony's chair away, please.  Jimmy Tom is standing up right now.  All right.  Because I'm going to get an exam.  Yes.  To see if I'm okay.  He hasn't been to the doctor in a long time, and we've arranged for someone at the Ryan Center  uptown to see him after the show if we find anything.  Okay.  Yeah, because, you know, my pancreas is given out.  Not your liver? 
[03:45:00]  Let's see.  Something else is breaking down.  And plus, I stubbed my toe.  And that's what bothers me the most.  So, can you fix the toe?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Let's see your feet, Tom.  Yeah, let's see them.  By the way, who's working the pal talk camera?  No, and I stink the place up.  No one's working the pal talk camera.  The thing is, I got my new socks on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Dad, you know how to do that?  And I have to keep them on.  That's right where Tommy is.  My doctor told me. 
[03:45:30]  Because I stubbed my toe.  All right.  Dr. Steve is listening to his heart.  Steve, you got to give us commentary, obviously.  I'm just listening to his heart, and it actually sounds pretty darn good.  Then take this working, huh?  Yep.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Take a deep breath for me.  Take a deep breath.  Oh, boy.  Emphysema for everyone.  Occasionally.  Well, I mostly smoke other things. 
[03:46:00]  I'm just going to feel it.  I smoke corn silk.  Corn silk?  How is his lungs?  Where do you get that in the city?  How is his lungs?  They're getting a cornfield in Jersey.  Where do you think you're going to get it at?  All right.  They got it in Long Island, too.  Steve?  Okay.  Now, Tom, you know your liver's a little enlarged.  I think my liver is a little enlarged.  Oh, that's not enough. 
[03:46:30]  Can I see your ankle?  What you're feeling, Steve, is the help me sign.  The liver's holding up.  Oh, the ankle, no good.  Ankle, no good.  Yeah, this is where it gets serious.  Well, this one's not too bad.  Oh, Tom.  No, this went worse.  Yeah, Dr. Steve is looking at Tippi Tom's ankle.  They're not too bad.  I can still walk.  So, obviously, everything's...  Have they been swollen like that for a long time?  Dr. Steve, you don't have to.  Well, they go up and down, you know. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  You know, some days up, some days down.  Dr. Steve, it's been about a year that I've seen it like that, yeah.  Well, uh...  Do you get shorter breath when you lay down?  No.  Okay.  All right.  What do you think that means, this ankle?  Get the podcast.  When you have big ankles, it can be from a lot of things, but it's always fluid, and it's  just the question is where...  Edema.  Edema, I mean?  Yeah.  Where is the fluid coming from?  Now, in his case, what this really looks like is a thing called venous stasis, which 
[03:47:30]  is just, um...  It's from gravity pulling on the veins in the legs.  The gravity?  And then...  I did not know that!  And fluid...  Now I know it.  Fluid leaks out from the veins.  And, uh...  Uh...  We'll talk about that after the show.  But if you, uh...  Elevate your legs when you're laying down, that'll actually help that.  That is true.  Yes.  Elevate them.  That's what I do!  Yep.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I...  Yeah, but...  Maybe you do.  I lay on concrete. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  It holds my back, too, because I got a bad back.  Okay.  So I lay on a flat surface and elevate my dukes, my feet, and that way there, the blood circulation  run right, so, because when I wake up, if I go to sleep, if I'm lucky, um, then I wake  up, or get up when I'm getting up, when I'm done laying down, so I can walk.  You spend most of the day on your feet?  Because I like to walk around town!  Yeah! 
[03:48:30]  Now, the thing that I'd like to do next is what we talked about earlier, is to check  your, uh, prostate, and check your rear end.  My prostate, Glenn?  Yep.  Well, that might be a job.  You want to go off my ass?  Yep.  What we'll do is we'll have you, uh, drop your drawers, and I'll have you bend over the  table, and we'll bring up a...  Right here?  Yep, we'll bring up a, uh, uh, sheet so that nobody can see you.  So something?  A camera?  No, and I'll just use my finger, and we'll just, uh, test you for blood, and we'll check 
[03:49:00]  out your prostate gland.  Check the, uh, so you can put the finger up the ass, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Will you rotate it a little bit?  I want to enjoy this process!  You don't have a free!  See, I just let the material be funny.  I don't have to try to be funny.  That's fucking great.  Will you rotate it a little bit?  Well, if you're going to put a finger up my ass, I want it to feel good. 
[03:49:30]  Okay.  And that's the way it is.  All right, let's get the sheet off for...  If you don't feel good, I'll be mad.  Mm-hmm.  You okay with doing this?  Well, when are we going to do this job?  Right now?  Where?  Right here?  Yep.  In front of everybody?  Yep.  They'll bring the sheet up.  Right here?  The sheet's up.  No one can see you, except us.  The figure's going in your ass?  If it's okay with you?  In front of everybody?  There's only a matter of time. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, it's just...  Wow!  You're just naked!  We're in front of everybody.  Yeah.  Tom, you bend forward and he checks you.  Yeah, that's all.  It's squeaky.  Yeah, but suppose they like my ass.  I'm golden buns.  And they may like me.  That's why we got to check out...  The golden buns don't want to...  I have too many people on me.  We're checking out...  And I can only handle a few at a time.  We're checking out golden buns for you.  It'll just be me.  Yeah.  And this is my partner, PA John.  We met before.  Oh, another doctor.  Yes, sir.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good! 
[03:50:30]  I got two doctors.  That's right.  And I'm happy.  You ready?  All right.  How are we going to do this?  You just drop your drawers and bend over to the table.  Just kind of touch your ankle there.  Just kind of bend over?  You going to do this?  Yep.  Yep.  All right.  Everybody, I'm going to get checked out.  Let me see what happens here.  By the way, I got to remind people, Dr. Steve got him a real checkup for later on today.  Dr. Steve is behind.  Come on!  Get this asshole out!  Tom, do you want to tell us what's going on? 
[03:51:00]  Ow!  It hurts!  You haven't even started yet.  Yeah, come on, Tom.  All right.  Let's listen to Tom.  I'm up here now.  Come on, man.  Get rid of me.  Oh!  All right.  Here we go.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Call the cops!  Wow.  Actually, your prostate is a normal size. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, that's good news.  If you have anything abnormal on it at all, and we're checking you for blood right now.  Oh, you got to pull some blood out of me, man.  No, no, no.  We're checking what we got out of your rear end.  Oh, you get it in there?  We hope not.  We hope we don't find it.  It's a miracle!  Miracles do happen!  What do you have to say, Tippi Tom? 
[03:52:00]  What do you think, Tippi Tom?  Well, I'll say I'm very happy that my doctors are here, and I'm very happy that I got a  clear, clean bill of health, and that's it.  And so what I got to say is that, thank you for the medical.  How much is the bill?  Okay, I'll pay the bill.  Dr. Steve handing over money.  It's very unusual for a doctor.  I'm going to go blow my horn. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  How did it feel?  The finger up there.  It felt great, man.  Well, he's a doctor.  He knows these things.  Sure.  Can this be the end of my bed?  Can this be the end of my bed?  I don't think we can get better than we did today.  All right, Dan.  I'm not a doctor.  All right.  Go get a beer, Tom.  Thanks, Tom.  Anyway, I think I better get out of here.  We've still got you an appointment at the Ryan Center today. 
[03:53:00]  What time?  Around one o'clock, it'll be fine.  Well, you know where I'll be.  I've given Keith the address.  You've still got to get those legs looked at.  Well, the blood test?  No, we'd just get, well, you'd need some blood test.  Well, I ain't got nothing wrong with my blood.  Fair enough.  Huh?  And my asshole's fine now.  Yep. 
[03:53:30]  So everything's all right, right?  We got to get your...  Everything that we've checked is all right.  Yes.  Yeah.  Except for your ankles.  Yes.  That needs to be dealt with.  You have Hillary Clinton-itis.  My ankle's no good.  All right, Tom.  Problem with my ankle.  Tom, go get a beer, buddy.  Don't forget your money on the table.  Well, I need a beer.  Anybody got any beer around here?  And you got money, Tom.  I don't have money.  You're outside.  Anybody else want to throw money?  You've got to make a trail of it out the door.  Dr. C, what's up with the legs?  Terrible.  He's just got a lot of fluid in there. 
[03:54:00]  Tom, Tom, Tom.  When the skin stretches out like that,  the blood can't get to it, the capillaries,  and it causes a thing called stasis dermatitis,  which is just a thickening of the skin.  It can crack and break, and he can get infected,  and it can cause some problems.  So he needs to get looked at.  He needs some elastic stockings.  How does he cure that?  Getting off his feet.  Part of his problem is he's probably on his feet 16 hours a day. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  Can he lose his legs?  Because that's what we worry about.  If he got an infection there, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it's a possibility.  All right.  Ah!  He's got poor circulation, too.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, poor circulation.  That's what it is.  We're heading toward line of the day.  We could go a lot later,  but the problem is we're going to have to cut something out of the show,  so we're thinking maybe we should just end here.  We could do that.  Because we don't want any of this cut out of the replay today,  that's for sure.  Anybody have a question for Dr. Steve? 
[03:55:00]  I have a question for you.  Is the virus coming to Boston?  My ass.  Is the virus coming to Boston?  We don't know yet.  I don't think so, to be honest with you.  It's hard to get a venue up there because they hate us,  so we can't get the venue we need in Boston  because it's owned by the city.  I think we're going to do one show,  and that's in Jersey, August 2nd, PNC.  We're going to take the summer off.  Yeah.  Any medical questions for Dr. Steve  before we get into line of the day?  Dr. Steve, I hear this incessant horn.  Tom's just whispering to thin air, Tom. 
[03:55:30]  You may have a schizoide affective disorder.  All right, let's do line of the day.  Sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive  so you never have to worry about losing any of your files.  Check it out at Carbonite.com, promo code XM. 
[03:56:00]  Here's the first of many runner-up lines of the day.  I'm sitting in my office area,  and, you know, somebody's ringing the doorbell,  pounding the door, and I'm like, you know,  I'm not expecting anybody.  Jesus.  Let's hear for Tom from that place.  Very happy he decided not to kill himself live on our show 
[03:56:30]  because that would have been the end of our show  as well as your life there, Tom.  Yeah, I realized that after the fact,  so I apologize.  I said that would be a lousy thing  because after the sex with Sam,  so I apologize.  Hey, Tom, what did you think of Brie Olsen?  She was very nice, very nice.  Brie Olsen.com.  You got to take a...  She has very nice... 
[03:57:00]  Boobies.  Yes.  You got to get a peek of what heaven's going to be all about there.  Well, hopefully.  How many people get to see heaven before they die?  You did.  That's right, and you also got to see...  Yes, they got to play motorboat, too.  That's right.  You also got to see the other option,  which was Tom taking a finger in a shitter.  Oh, yeah.  So be a good boy, Tom.  I'd do five bucks out the door, Sid.  Go that way.  All right.  And you can meet the penthouse chicks tonight.  Give them one more hit.  Brie Olsen along with Victoria Zedrock,  who's Dr. Z,  who will be on Steve's show tomorrow night,  Dr. Steve,  and Justine, Julie, today, 
[03:57:30]  if you're in Staten Island,  nightcap video from 4 to 8 p.m.  Yeah.  And, oh, fuck.  You all right, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's really easy to recover from sex addiction with that.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Oh, God, I'm such a whore.  She just read everybody's mind. 
[03:58:00]  Now, this is going to be interesting,  because how the fuck did someone have a better line than that today?  That was a runner-up line of the day?  All right.  It was a very funny show today.  It was a very funny show today.  Absolutely.  Here's the next runner-up line of the day.  Yes, you do know.  How big is your cock?  What, like six inches?  That's not bad.  Arrest that man.  Wait a minute.  Tom, what happened?  Who do you want arrested?  Arrest him.  Why do you want him arrested?  Arrest him right now. 
[03:58:30]  Put the cuffs on him.  Come on.  Why?  Get over here and cuff him.  Why?  Why do you want to arrest Sam?  Well, because he insulted me.  Yeah.  You're damn wrong.  I'll insult you.  I'll insult you again.  Three times in a row.  What do you think of that?  You scared?  This is live?  Yeah.  Let's hear it for Tippi Tom, too.  He had a great opinion today.  All right. 
[03:59:00]  I apologize.  All right.  Be quiet for a second there, Tom.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Okay, look.  That, first of all, is a big pink boxing glove.  That was one in the crane.  And then that, yes, is a pink bag.  It's very heavy.  And why wouldn't you carry your lady's bag if it's very heavy?  The big boxing glove, huh?  Did somebody punch you in the dignity with it?  Take some of Anthony's stuff home with you, because he's not going to be using that. 
[03:59:30]  And the video of Tippi Tom sitting in Anthony's seat.  That was good.  That one's going to be a good one.  That'll be up online, hopefully, in the next day or two.  You made more money, Tom?  Yeah, I need more money right now.  Right now!  Another runner-up line of the day.  I will not, I will not use any of those things again. 
[04:00:00]  I want everything disinfected, the entire side of the studio, and I will not sit in that  You're fired!  You're out of business now, buddy!  You're fired!  Hey, you talking to me?  That's Tom Live again.  I know you ain't talking to me, man!  Tom Live, pushing Anthony's buttons. 
[04:00:30]  He picked the perfect button there.  One more?  One more runner-up line of the day.  Erock's dad, the coiner of the phrase,  Yeah, he's mine.  You know what?  No, he's not.  You know what?  Let's hear it for Erock's father stopping by.  He gets right in the action. 
[04:01:00]  This is the first show you've seen live, right?  Second one.  Second.  We're proud of your boy, you know that.  I'm going to say it right to your face.  I love the Erock, you know that.  I used to.  Oh, God.  All right, here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:01:30]  No, and I'll just use my finger,  and we'll just test you for blood,  and we'll check out your prostate gland.  Check the, uh...  So you can put the finger up the ass, huh?  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Yeah, well, you rotate it a little bit.  I'm enjoying it, Tom.  Oh, we can't have a free.  Come on, you fucker, to my bedtime.  All right.  Tippy Tom with Line of the Day. 
[04:02:00]  The next time I see you on the street corner...  Yeah.  ...you in a lot of trouble.  All right.  You guys have fun today?  Yeah!  This is a blast.  Big A, thank you.  Who else?  Dr. Steve, tomorrow night, 9 o'clock.  9 o'clock.  Saturday night virus.  Big A wants to plug his own birthday party.  Big A, when's your birthday?  It passed.  When did it pass? 
[04:02:30]  June 14th.  June 14th?  Actually, me and...  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Big A.  Big A!  Happy birthday to you.  Who loves you, Big A? 
[04:03:00]  Who loves you?  Open Anthony.  That's right.  How old are you?  You, you, you, you, you.  45.  45.  45.  45.  45.  41.  Happy birthday.  Yeah, absolutely.  What did you get for your birthday?  I'm 12 years old.  Look at me.  Where are you going to be for your birthday?  Um, actually, me and no brother Paul is having a breath party tonight at Olouni's. 
[04:03:30]  145 West, 45 between Broadway and 6th Avenue at 8 p.m.  Well, judging by that plug, by that plug, it's going to be a rather poorly attended party.  No one understood it.  Because you said me and Paul are having a birth party.  Yeah.  Um, uh, you and no brother Paul are having a birthday party at Olouni's?  Yes, I don't, yes, at Olouni's Pub.  Olouni's Pub.  Anyone know what that is? 
[04:04:00]  Nope.  No, Olouni's.  Olouni's.  Olouni's.  Olouni's.  It's 45th and 6th.  45th and 6th?  Oh, 45th and 6th.  And, um, what time is the party?  8 p.m.  8 p.m.  Okay.  And, uh, we haven't seen or heard from Paul.  Uh, FH isn't good enough for you anymore?  Yeah, why weren't you at FH Riley's?  Why, yeah, what's up with that, Big A?  Where is FH Riley's?  I don't remember.  Why wouldn't you go to F400 New York Avenue just to have, I don't know why you wouldn't have your party there. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  What, did Brett piss you off?  No, no.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  All right, let's hear it for Big A, everyone.  Let him off.  Oh, yeah.  And where's Cream Pie Jones?  Cream Pie Jones?  He's probably trying to smell his own dick.  If you don't, I will.  And finally, finally, Cream Pie Jones, everyone.  Were you napping? 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah.  How was that?  How was it?  Let's be honest.  That was the most amazing thing of my entire life.  Yeah, it was fucking so cool to watch her fucking doing that.  It was like watching somebody, like, smoke a roach.  All right, guys.  No, Cream Pie's in good shape.  She was fucking, it was hot, man.  Absolutely.  Not your dick, but it was hot.  A lot of people think we're taking next week off.  We're not.  It's just a long weekend, that's all.  Yeah, no, I'm not. 
[04:05:30]  We'll be back Tuesday.  What?  Because a lot of people are saying have a good week off.  We're not.  No.  We're back Tuesday.  We're just taking Monday off.  That's all.  Yeah, just Monday.  So spread the word.  Spread the word.  I'll be gone, though, for the few days.  Where are you going, Jimmy?  Los Angeles, or as I call it, La La Land.  I'm, uh, because David Tell's hosting the Gong Show, so I'm the judge on two of the episodes,  which we shoot in one day.  Very cool.  You'll be back, what, Thursday?  No, Wednesday. 
[04:06:00]  Wednesday, Wednesday, but I'll be back on the show Thursday.  Oh, snap.  That almost deserved a swim walk, you know that.  Oh, well, you know.  I'm shy.  And we didn't hear from Ted today.  More jive talking, Jimmy.  You know what?  There was so much busyness, we didn't need them.  I mean, Ted is very frightened.  Ted's a fearful person.  Yeah, he gets nervous.  By the way, I asked D-Rock to pull a yodeling song.  Maybe we could talk about yodeling next week.  Ooh. 
[04:06:30]  Did you get my text?  Yes, I got it.  Don't scream at me.  All right, guys, we gotta go.  So, thank you for stopping by.  Biggest time we've ever had here at XM.  And we'll see you guys Tuesday.  Bye.  Hey, this is Mike Myers, and you're...  Wow, one second, I'm sorry.  I thought for a second I was inside Opie, and I thought, boy, that's faintly medical.  Hi, this is Mike Myers, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. </pre>
