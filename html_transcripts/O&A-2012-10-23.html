<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the presidential debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  The hosts criticized the debate's focus on foreign policy, finding it boring, and expressed their annoyance at the upcoming election.  They heavily commented on Ann Coulter's Twitter reactions and the perceived biases of MSNBC and Fox News.  The segment was punctuated by humorous jingles, including "Hoagie in my mouth" and "Coke floats in my cup."  The conversation then shifted to the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Detroit Tigers, followed by a venting session about the New York Jets and Mark Sanchez.  A lengthy, mocking discussion of the 2000 election's "hanging chads" ensued.  The hosts previewed upcoming guests, including D.L. Hughley, The Big Show, and a highly anticipated interview with Peter Criss of Kiss, emphasizing the controversial revelations in his book, "Makeup to Break Up."  They also briefly discussed Donald Trump's upcoming announcement regarding Obama and criticized Facebook's design. The segment concluded with the offensive "F.U. Line" calls.

Comedian D.L. Hughley then joined the show.  After initial comments about his attire, the conversation turned to the Obama-Romney debates, focusing on Obama's performance and criticisms of Romney's stance on Detroit's bankruptcy and job creation.  Hughley shared personal anecdotes, including a humorous but uncomfortable story about his estranged father's unexpected appearance at a family barbecue.  He also discussed the adoption process, racial disparities in adoption, and the Boy Scouts, with several crude and sexually suggestive jokes.  The hosts and Hughley made numerous negative remarks about "Honey Boo Boo" and her family.  The segment concluded with plugs for Hughley's upcoming projects.

Professional wrestler The Big Show was the next guest.  The conversation began with comments about the show's coffee, before transitioning to discussions about artificial sweeteners, video game appearances (including his absence from WWE 13), and the Attitude Era. He recounted his pre-wrestling jobs, his love of science fiction and fantasy novels (mentioning authors like Brandon Sanderson and Brent Weeks), and his impressive collection of Star Trek memorabilia.  Big Show discussed boxing, his travels (including Egypt and China), the challenges of his size, and his family. He also shared anecdotes about his early career with WCW, his interactions with Hulk Hogan and Stone Cold Steve Austin, and a run-in with a Canadian border agent. He promoted WWE 13 and answered questions about his career and preferences amongst younger wrestlers.  Big Show's responses were frequently punctuated with colorful language.

The show then delved into a discussion of Peter Criss's book, "Makeup to Break Up," detailing its unflattering portrayal of Gene Simmons, including descriptions of Simmons' hygiene and sexual behavior.  They played a snippet of an acoustic Guns N' Roses performance, criticizing Axl Rose's vocals.  A pre-recorded interview with Peter Criss followed, covering his battle with breast cancer, his strained relationships with other KISS members, financial troubles, and near-death experiences. He discussed power struggles within KISS, revealing feelings of betrayal and resentment towards Simmons and Stanley, and shared numerous anecdotes, including a comparison of Ace Frehley's and Criss's penises and an unusual game involving Gene Simmons. The hosts interjected with comments and jokes throughout.

The live interview with Peter Criss began, focusing on the book's controversial content, including mentions of "mafia involvement" and other unspecified issues. One host recounted a childhood fantasy involving Kiss members.  Criss received hugs from the hosts. DJ Who Kid then entered, wearing a Spider-Man mask, boasting about his Instagram and using offensive language.  The conversation shifted to "Jimmy Guest Day," focusing on Jim Norton's relentless ribbing of Sal, the guest prep sheet writer.  Who Kid's often vulgar and sexually charged commentary dominated the segment, including discussions of his promiscuity, Instagram, and sexual encounters.  His claims about Lil Wayne and Stevie J were verified with online video.  Reef from Shade 45 repeatedly distanced Shade 45 and SiriusXM from Who Kid's statements.  Who Kid also discussed producing 50 Cent's "What Up Gangsta." The show ended with a jingle for E-Rock and mentions of Vivica A. Fox's previous visit and Jim Norton's reaction to a particularly shocking detail from Peter Criss' book involving a public figure and a double blowjob.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we? 
[00:04:00]  I have no idea if we do.  So, flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that I can't believe that I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in air every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Pying to these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off like, surprise! 
[00:05:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Oh, you want to hear the greatest of all?  Double gathers, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Coke floats in my cup.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Coke floats in my cup. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  E-Rod.  Hoagie in my mouth.  Hoagie in my mouth.  I was watching a movie last night, and halfway through it, I turned to my chick, and I'm  like, oh, did you hear that jingle yet?  She's like, what are you talking about?  And I actually had to pause the movie.  I stopped everything.  It went over to my computer.  And I listened to the Hoagie in my mouth jingle twice.  E-Rod, call me, nerd girl. 
[00:06:00]  Laughed for a little bit, and then I was like, all right, time to put the movie back on.  Cool.  Float.  I like that one.  Yeah.  The jingle contest.  Did you see the video?  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Where it almost looks like the dude's singing.  Got all the features.  Of course, we're talking about this.  The big jingle contest underway.  We look on the board like I run the show.  Hoagie in my mouth.  Hoagie in my mouth.  E-Rod, army nigga.  E-Rod.  E-Rod, army nigga. 
[00:06:30]  E-Rod.  E-Rod.  E-Rod.  Fat boy in the seat.  Bikini girls on the street.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  That is a goddamn good one, man.  Sure is.  Yeah.  Well, should we talk about this debate for a minute, or what?  Well, yeah, I guess so.  That was boring.  It was pretty dullsville, the debate.  I think people have had it.  I mean, the undecideds are really undecided still. 
[00:07:00]  They shouldn't be.  Fucking make up your mind and let's do this.  Come on already.  Two weeks, right?  Yeah.  Two weeks out.  Two fucking weeks.  Holy fuck.  Let's get it over with already, for the love of God.  Enough already.  How funny is Ann Coulter on Twitter?  I was reading her live tweets to the debate.  And when Obama...  I thought Obama was doing well.  I watched like 10, 15 minutes.  And there was one answer where Obama said, I did not apologize. 
[00:07:30]  I did not go on an apology tour.  And she Twittered, no, Obama didn't apologize.  He rolled over on his back like Fido.  Jesus.  She's Fido.  She's a tough broad.  Dude, she's brutal.  She's tough.  Yeah.  She really makes me laugh, though.  I wonder what gets to her.  It's got to be something.  Yeah.  I wonder what it is.  Got to crack that code someday.  Yeah.  The debate last night was on foreign policy.  It was dull.  None of those real, like, holy shit moments. 
[00:08:00]  I mean, there were a couple of funny one-liners.  I think it's a dumb debate topic, considering where we are as a country.  Sure, you got to know where these guys stand in some foreign affairs.  But I don't think you need two and a half hours, or an hour and a half of it.  It was ridiculous.  It's very hard for them to stay on topic, too, with foreign affairs.  Because it's just, I don't know.  And they didn't really delve into foreign affairs.  It was pretty much Middle Eastern affairs.  Right.  So, I mean, they never got into anything about Korea or Mexico. 
[00:08:30]  You know, there's apparently a giant drug and gun murder problem south of our border,  and immigration problems.  What about Ireland?  Ireland?  Yeah.  We didn't hear much about Ireland last night during the debates.  I didn't think there was that much to talk about with Ireland.  Yeah.  But, I mean, let's see what's going on with the whole world.  Just, like, pick a country.  I'm just going with your whole thing there.  Enough with the Middle East.  Enough about the Middle East. 
[00:09:00]  And Romney's in a bad spot because he's never done foreign policy.  Yeah.  The president always has the upper hand against the challenger for foreign policy debates.  And even with that said, it wasn't a trashing.  Obama, you know, I'm not blind.  Obama won the debate last night.  That's what I think anyway.  A lot of other people do, too.  But there's some staunch blind people that say that Romney won, which is kind of silly. 
[00:09:30]  Well, you're going to get that.  But, you know, there's the blind people on both sides that won't admit to anything.  But I don't know.  But, I mean, Obama's doing foreign policy.  And then when you ask Romney, he's like, well, this is what I would do.  And Obama almost smiles.  And I'm like, you know, you don't even know how this is done yet.  He's got the job.  Just like you said a few minutes ago before we started, when Obama took office, he had no clue about foreign policy.  No, he's some Chicago guy.  And, you know, he didn't know shit about foreign policy. 
[00:10:00]  Next thing you know, he's thrown into the Middle East crisis.  Yeah.  You just got to hope you can surround yourself with some wise people.  You know, listen to the people that you have in place to deal with foreign policy.  And get yourself up to speed on it.  That's pretty much what every president has had to do over the course of the years.  And I think Romney could do that.  I don't think he's retarded.  I think he could get in there and do the job if need be. 
[00:10:30]  And I personally think better than Obama.  But, you know, it's kind of hard to say at this point.  Based on what, though?  That's the problem.  Based on the fact that Obama, you know, contrary to some people's beliefs, even in this very studio, I don't think Obama has done this bang-up fucking job as far as foreign policy goes.  He did the work that anyone would have done.  Again, people can debate that as far as killing Osama bin Laden goes. 
[00:11:00]  I don't think that was this great, difficult decision for a president to make.  After 9-11, Jesus Christ, everybody was looking for him.  Let's not...  Bush never found him.  No, he didn't.  He didn't.  Pakistan found him in fucking...  For lack of a...  In November of 2001.  Right.  Gave him a nice, comfy spot for a decade.  The worst.  I don't know.  It was one of those fucking debates where the one that got the most zingers seemed to have come off as the winner. 
[00:11:30]  And Obama had a couple of funny lines about, you know, the battleships.  He smashed him with that one.  The battleship line was like the big one.  We got that clip.  Our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917.  The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.  We're now down to 285.  We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.  That's unacceptable to me.  I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.  Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since it was founded in 1947. 
[00:12:00]  We've changed for the first time since FDR.  Since FDR, we've always had the strategy of saying we can fight in two conflicts at once.  Now we're changing to one conflict.  Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.  And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is the combination of the budget cuts that the President has as well as the sequestration cuts. 
[00:12:30]  That, in my view, is making our future less certain and less secure.  Well, Bob, I just need to comment on this.  First of all, the sequester is not something that I propose.  It's something that Congress has proposed.  It will not happen.  The budget that we're talking about is not reducing our military spending.  It's maintaining it.  But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.  You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.  Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military has changed. 
[00:13:00]  We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them.  We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.  And so the question is not a game of battleship where we're counting ships.  It's what are our capabilities?  Wow.  That was a fucking...  And the funny way was to watch him get into it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you mentioned the Navy, and it was like he was just setting up.  He was waiting for it.  That fucking chin pop. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, that's just based on experience.  I mean, Obama's in there, and Romney just doesn't know how that works yet.  Why didn't Chris Matthews mouth off about how disrespectful that was?  He was being very condescending.  Like he mouthed off about how Romney was actually going against the Constitution when he would call out the president on certain things.  Chris Matthews is a fucking idiot.  Well, I can tell you why Matthews did that.  Why?  He's biased.  Oh, that's right.  Kind of like, you know, Hannity might be.  Oh, last night it was hilarious. 
[00:14:00]  And O'Reilly might be.  Yeah, but I mean, really?  Coming out and saying it's against the Constitution of the United States to call the president out on something.  What a stunning victory!  It was unbelievable!  Someone got my men's hairspray!  My hair's flying all over the place!  Yeah, he, uh...  I watched CNN.  It seems to be a little more in the middle.  A little bit.  A little bit closer to the middle. 
[00:14:30]  Well, way closer than MSNBC, certainly.  Or Fox is, that's for sure.  Right.  Those two networks are completely out of control now.  Oh, it's really crazy to watch people that are supposedly delivering the news, and their bias is so strong one way or the other that you can't possibly watch them and think you're getting a fair assessment of what happened.  Fair and balanced, right?  Fair and balanced. 
[00:15:00]  And then they use slogans that are completely not what they do.  MSNBC is lean forward, which is like, we're not left, we're not right, we lean forward.  And then there's Fox fair and balanced, as long as it's on the right.  You could go back and forth and swear you're watching two completely different fucking countries.  It's amazing.  Yeah, because I was going back and forth after the debate.  I don't know how that's good for our country in the end. 
[00:15:30]  Well, as long as we know it.  I mean, there are people...  Most people don't know it.  I get accused constantly of being a Fox shill.  And why don't you...  I love this one, too.  It's like, Anthony, why don't you turn Fox off once in a while and stop just repeating talking points?  Shut the fuck up.  Phone news.  Phone news, man.  And the truth of the matter is, I go from...  I look at every news station. 
[00:16:00]  And if I want to hear something that someone's saying, I'll watch it on goddamn C-SPAN without people chiming in.  I make my own goddamn decision.  But if I like Romney, of course, I must just watch Fox and I'm brainwashed.  And that's why I like Romney.  No, I like Romney because he's not Obama.  I think Obama's horrible for this country.  I think just looking at where this country is four years later is reason enough to vote for somebody else than Obama. 
[00:16:30]  The fact that there are still people with blinders on that don't see the shitty shape that the economy is in,  us on the world stage, how we look silly,  and how he just wants to keep decimating the things that have made this country great in the past,  that's reason enough for me to vote for anybody else but Obama. 
[00:17:00]  Thank God.  Two weeks to go.  Yes.  Thank God.  I can't register.  Thank God.  I missed my registration.  I didn't know I was fucking a month out.  It doesn't even matter.  Obama already won this state.  That's actually right.  Unless you care about the local guys.  Unless you care about the local guys, it doesn't even matter in New York.  It's a landslide victory for Obama in New York State.  And the Democrats almost every fucking time.  Some of the local elections go this way or that. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, it's all about the local elections.  This election comes down to what?  Three states at this point?  That's it?  It really is.  Stupid Ohio.  Stupid Florida.  These dumb states that can't make up their mind.  Are there three or four swings?  Again, I've said it.  I think they're the only smart states.  There's about four, I guess.  It really is crazy.  But they're really saying Florida and Ohio at this point.  I mean, I know they could come up with some formula that would incorporate the popular vote into the electoral college  and make it a little more fucking interesting for people that aren't in the goddamn swing states. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  You know?  It's frustrating.  This country really has a lot of red.  This country is ready to split in half.  That didn't work well back in the day.  Might as well give it another shot.  Look at that map.  Give it another shot?  Look at that map.  Yeah.  Look at that map.  There's no blue.  We just need to agree to disagree.  Just agree to disagree.  There's blue on the left and some blue on the top right, and that is it. 
[00:18:30]  The rest of this fucking country is red.  A lot of red.  Yeah.  So what is it down to?  We're down to pretty much, what is it, Ohio?  Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Michigan, Colorado, Nevada.  From recent poll averages, the closest races are in Colorado, Florida, and Iowa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Iowa.  Yeah.  They don't really talk about Iowa that much.  48-8 for Obama and 46-8 for Romney. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  Two weeks, and then we finally figure this shit out.  But then again, it looks like it's going to be really close, and we're going to have  some hanging, what were they again?  Hanging chads.  Remember the hanging chads?  Are we going to have some hanging chads this time around?  Yeah.  What's the hanging chads?  Remember the fucking, well, they weren't, well, it wasn't completely, you know.  It was the stupid ballads, the ballads from Florida.  Remember those assholes holding it up to the light?  Well, I see a hanging chad here.  I don't know. 
[00:19:30]  Let's put it in the hanging chad pile.  They called those little nubs that would pop out of the ballad a chad, and if it wasn't  all the way popped out and it was just hanging there, obviously the person  popped it out for that.  But if it was just hanging there.  How do we know for sure?  Yeah.  Oh, it could have been this.  So they had a whole pile of hanging chads, and one by one, they're like, well, this  hanging chad.  Oh, hanging chad.  Look, there you go.  Look at these idiots.  Hanging chad.  We're looking at a guy lifting up his glasses. 
[00:20:00]  His eyes are bug-eyed so he can check out the hanging chad.  Sounds like something the Klan is doing.  Chad.  Exactly.  Look at this guy.  Look at this guy.  The guy's got a magnifying glass up to his eye, looking for hanging chads.  Fucking hanging chads.  Oh, man.  This country is ridiculous.  Well.  Why did we even allow this?  And who were these people that had to decide on the hanging chads?  That's how they're voting for the president of the United States in some states. 
[00:20:30]  Meanwhile, in New York, we've had touchscreen MetroCard machines for the last 15 years.  I just don't understand.  Yeah, when I go in.  We don't want to make it easy for people to vote.  Right, Ed?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what it is.  And that's against black people, apparently.  If you do anything, if you change anything in the vote, they come out and say you're racist and you're trying to prevent people from voting.  Yeah, we've had my polling place. 
[00:21:00]  You've got the piece of paper and shit.  Right.  And then you fill it out and then you've got to put it through some machine.  That's it?  And it reads it.  Yeah.  Oh, so it doesn't do hanging chads?  No hanging chad.  Chad.  No, but then it reads it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  This election is going to be really fucking close, man.  Yeah, it is a close one.  Will this be closer than Bush Gore?  Yeah.  It's going to be closer than Bush Gore.  I think it's going to be closer.  Will there be a recount? 
[00:21:30]  My God.  Of course, any close vote, there's going to be a goddamn recount on this thing.  Yeah.  But I really do think it's going to be closer than people think, especially people on Obama's side.  Obama's, I really still think they think it's a home run.  They've got nothing to worry about.  Yeah.  Really?  I think a lot of the Obama people can't even conceive of him losing.  They can't even fucking imagine it.  I don't know, man.  No, dude, please.  They're crazy as far as that goes. 
[00:22:00]  They really don't think he's going to, he's even got a chance of losing.  Stupid.  I'm obsessed with the hanging Chad now.  Chad!  Obama looks like Gilbert Godfrey in this picture, doesn't he?  He looks like fucking Gilbert.  Yeah, he's making a scrunchy face.  He's a dork from the side.  I don't like that they shake hands and they're all pally-wally.  Yep.  Because the rest of this country, fucking, you pick a side and then you hate the other side.  Yeah.  So why are the two main guys, like, shaking hands?  And then they go to things and joke. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Kind of making jokes.  Yeah, the joke night was fun, right?  Yeah, they were having fun making jokes.  I don't know.  Romney should have, the thing, he should have won this.  I think Romney needed to win this.  I know he had a great one the first one.  He didn't have a chance of winning this thing.  Because he was in a bad position with foreign policy.  I think he, on purpose, I think he laid back.  He was agreeing with Obama on a lot of things.  A lot of people were saying he was trying to not come off like an extremist. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  Trying not to challenge the president in such a way where the president can turn around and make him look silly, which he did on a couple of points.  It's like that battleship thing.  But I also think it's very hard, foreign policy, for a challenger.  Of course it is.  Obama had a good moment, too, which I watched one 15-minute hunk where he said, you know, Governor, you agree with us on a lot of things.  And for some reason you think that if you say it louder, that it changes. 
[00:23:30]  He's basically saying you're just saying the same things we are, but you're saying it louder, which I thought was a good point whether or not it was true.  But, I mean, why can't the challenger agree with the incumbent on certain foreign policy issues?  You should be.  I mean, it's not that far out to say, wow, Osama bin Laden being dead is probably better than him not being dead.  Wow, you're crazy agreeing with the—  It's good to agree.  —on that.  Yeah, yeah.  There's some things, of course.  It doesn't happen a lot with either side, but it's good when that happens. 
[00:24:00]  Did you see the honesty graph?  Were you studying the honesty graph since the last time we talked about this?  No.  The undecided voters with the line going up and down?  I wasn't watching that.  You weren't watching that version?  No.  Which version were you watching?  I watched C-SPAN, so I don't get distracted with any of the stupid—  C-SPAN!  That way you don't get distracted with any of the news station's own fucking personal bullshit that they throw in.  Do you honestly think on Fox News or MSNBC or CNN, whenever they have a certain poll that they're showing, that it isn't biased because the people watching that and participating in that— 
[00:24:30]  Want to hear that?  They're the ones—yeah, of course they're biased.  MSNBC will find a positive Obama poll every time.  Of course they will.  Yeah, well, I call it the honesty graph because every time either Romney or Obama had a little taste of honesty, no one in this country wants to hear that.  No.  They'd rather hear your candidates and your politicians just lie, obviously. 
[00:25:00]  Of course.  Keep it all above the line.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  And they both call each other off of being a liar constantly.  Now, that isn't true.  But soon as—  That's not true.  No, sir.  That is not true, Governor.  But supposedly these are undecideds.  And as soon as either guy was, like, taking a little shot or saying it's not true, it would dip down as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The stuff from the side, when you watch their profiles looking at each other, Obama had a better stare down on this one. 
[00:25:30]  Because Romney had, like, a weird half a smirk that he looked almost gay.  It looked really weird.  It's very—I couldn't imagine having to sit there and look at the other guy as you're—  Trashing them?  Well, no.  As he's talking, because you know you're on split screen.  You know people are seeing you.  You can't be blinking like a lunatic.  You can't scratch your nose like you're picking—  There goes my candidacy.  You're picking your nose.  You can't fucking make a—  There goes my candidacy.  I know, really. 
[00:26:00]  They can't—  You've got to think they want to pick their nose once in an hour and a half.  How do you not want to scrape a good one off the roof?  And admire it.  They never drink water.  Right.  They never go, like, and open their mouth and do it weird.  Why is that?  Every single move.  But what's the water thing?  Obviously, they've learned—  It makes you look guilty.  Don't put a finger to your nose.  Yeah.  Is that what you learned?  It makes you look guilty if you're drinking water.  Yeah, yeah.  It makes you look like your mouth must be dry.  There's probably—there's a problem here. 
[00:26:30]  Or if you have a sip, maybe, but—  Yeah, yeah.  And they probably do it at a strategic time.  But, like me, I drink water every 10 seconds.  Of course.  These guys fucking never do.  Pull a flask out of your back pocket and fucking make a swig.  Yeah, it's a beer.  I'll loosen up.  We're not talking about Joe Biden right now.  Oh, yeah.  Because he—  Old Joe Biden.  What else happened last night?  We should move on because we've got a lot of guests today, man.  Oh, yeah?  You've got the Giants going to the World Series, Anthony.  Yes, the Giants win the pennant.  Remember baseball?  The Giants win the pennant.  The Giants win the pennant.  I have no idea.  Remember baseball? 
[00:27:00]  No, it's over, right?  That's it?  Well, the fucking—  That's it?  I guess you've got the Giants and the Tigers.  You've got to—sorry, San Francisco, but you've got to push for the Tigers.  They have some tough times up there.  Give them a World Series.  All right.  Give them a World Series.  Are they actually in?  San Francisco is a beautiful fucking city.  Detroit, not so much.  Let's give the World Series to the Tigers.  How about we all do that?  The D.  Give the D something to celebrate.  At least you know the town won't go up in flames. 
[00:27:30]  There's just nothing left of it.  You know what?  Nothing left to burn.  They might as well at this point.  What, are they going to flip over?  Win the World Series, burn the rest of the city down, and let's start over.  Well, if you ask Florenton, because he's a Giants fan about that, like, what about Detroit?  Yeah, yeah, well, why would they want to do that?  Because Florenton will have the most logical answer about why Detroit should be burned to the ground and San Francisco should win.  Yeah, but where was everybody in the 60s when San Francisco was fighting for gays?  Exactly.  They should win.  What's the problem?  I want to be fantasy football. 
[00:28:00]  He's a Giants fan?  Oh, he's been in San Francisco.  He's a fucking creep.  He's a weirdo.  He's a Giants and Dolphins fan.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  He's a weirdo being from Jersey.  How does that happen?  That's strange.  I know you get one team you kind of take interest in for whatever reason, but not hardcore two fucking sports like that.  San Francisco, yeah.  Well, you guys didn't discuss the fucking Jets game yesterday, did you?  No.  Did you watch the Jets game?  No.  I tweeted about it at the end.  I thought Sanchez looked good.  Yeah, but that's Sanchez. 
[00:28:30]  I mean, at the end.  No, but that's Sanchez.  That's what us Jets fans have to deal with.  He's got pretty good above-average skills, but he fucking panics every fucking time, and he can't do it.  In the end, he can't do it.  I could show you 10 games where he did that exact same shit.  How annoyed were you?  Marching.  I didn't even tweet.  I was just so depressed.  We should have won that game.  Marching down the field, and then I'm sitting there going, well, all right, how is Sanchez going to blow it this time? 
[00:29:00]  He can't do it.  I don't know what it is.  He's like Romo.  He's a choke.  Romo's a choke.  He's a choke.  I don't know above-average skills, but when it comes down to winning the big.  He's a first-ballot Hall of Fame player.  He's one of the greatest fucking home run hitters.  He really is great.  But in the playoffs and pressure, he sucks a dick.  That's what we should do one of these days.  Pressure situations. 
[00:29:30]  Who fucking blows it?  And Sanchez is on that list.  Yeah, he's got skills.  Of course he does.  But man, when the pressure's on, I don't know what the fuck happens to the guy.  Look who didn't blow it.  Fucking Manning in the Giants Super Bowl.  It was fourth down, and the man caught the fucking ball on his helmet.  Tyree.  It's like, that's the guy who gets it done.  Say what you want about Brady, but in pressure situations, for the most part, the guy hangs  in there and tries to get the job done.  He doesn't panic.  Joe Montana stunk under pressure.  Did he?  No.  He scared me for a second there. 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, what am I missing?  But fuck, I mean, Eli Manning, under pressure, he doesn't fucking blow it.  You know who wasn't good under pressure?  Theismann's leg.  Oh, wow.  And then he gets away.  Eli Manning doesn't fucking fall apart under pressure.  Well, that's the famous catch, of course.  That's one of the best catches in the history.  I was at your house when we watched that.  Yeah.  That's one of the best catches ever.  Was that more than a catch?  It's got to be the greatest catch ever.  We've had this argument. 
[00:30:30]  What catch is better?  Lin Swan had a few good ones.  The Franco Harris weird one?  Yeah.  That might be the best.  Off his leg?  No, he caught it off whose leg?  It's been too long now.  I don't know whatever.  I like those wacky ones where they bounce around.  He gets it done.  He had that fucking pass to Cruz on Sunday when everyone thought the Giants were done.  And then Sanchez.  Stay out of football.  Believe me, you don't have to sell me on that.  Why don't you like football, though? 
[00:31:00]  It's an amazing sport to watch.  It's a great, great sport to watch on TV.  Way better than basketball, way better than baseball, and way better than hockey, which I love.  If there's nothing else on, I'm not doing anything else, I might pop it on.  You never got into it?  Not fanatically.  I'll fucking watch it occasionally, but I won't make sure I'm seated in front of a fucking television every Sunday to fucking watch a multitude of football games. 
[00:31:30]  I finally got the red zone, too, man.  The red zone.  I'm all in.  As a matter of fact, I need four tickets for the game this Sunday with the Dolphins.  Oh, boy.  Who's stepping up?  Oh, boy.  Who's stepping up for me?  Oh, boy.  Do we have any connections?  Roland might be my connection on this one.  We'll see.  Roland.  Roland.  I see the Giants.  The Jazz.  The Jazz.  Hey, your boy Trump says he has something very, very big concerning the president.  What's that?  My boy? 
[00:32:00]  Trump.  My boy Trump?  You love Trump, don't you?  Not really.  I'm joking, dude.  He's fun to fucking watch.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  The headline is, I have something very, very big concerning the president of the United States.  He's planning a big announcement about Barack Obama.  I have something very, very big concerning the president of the United States.  Something very big.  I think you're teasing it as opposed to just getting it out there.  Yeah.  I will be announcing it sometime, probably Wednesday, and it's going to be very big. 
[00:32:30]  He's teasing his big announcement.  What a fuck.  Another guy that keeps making it about himself.  But I'll tell you, as much as Trump can drive you fucking nuts, that genius knows how to market himself.  He certainly does.  Fuck.  He throws himself into the election.  How did he do that?  Who cares what you think?  You build houses.  They were fucking talking.  The president and the challenger were talking about him on fucking one of the debates.  That motherfucker gets him.  His whole thing is, he builds fucking buildings.  You're fired.  You're fired.  And he does that dumb show.  And yet he's somehow in the mix. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  Fucking genius, man.  You gotta give him that.  Gretchen Carlson asked Trump, will it change the election?  Trump replied, possibly.  It's very big.  Bigger than anybody would know.  Oh, boy.  Did it happen in Gurney?  Yeah.  Is that something?  Where's the Gurney guy?  Did it happen in Gurney?  I like to think that the Gurney guy was completely telling the truth, but he's such a fucking  weirdo.  No one bought it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good old Gurney guy. 
[00:33:30]  So Trump will announce that tomorrow, I guess.  The Donald, as they call him.  He's had some funny tweets lately.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  He's a good one to follow.  I do follow him, yeah.  I do follow him.  Twitter's just mutating into a very strange thing.  It really is the be-all, end-all of everybody's discussion.  And how it's just, it really, no one does anything without having to comment on it on  Twitter.  I know.  I'm guilty of it.  You know. 
[00:34:00]  Of course, we're all in.  It's just such a weird thing to want people to know what you're doing, and it's just  an odd thing.  Facebook is kind of like, uh...  Just sitting there.  Just sitting there, and Twitter is sort of the thing right now.  People realized, you know, people do realize they didn't need all the bells and whistles  and stuff.  I mean, originally, the MySpace thing was hilarious, with the fucking 20 videos playing  the second you logged on someone's page, and fucking music starts playing.  You gotta, you're clicking mute on 20 windows that are there. 
[00:34:30]  The spam was unbearable.  The spam is crazy.  And it just reached the point where it's like, look, here's fucking, you know, 140 characters.  That's all you got.  You could link stuff, you know, pictures, videos, and things like that.  But for the most part, uh, good, be funny, be interesting, whatever.  I've been, uh, I was late to Facebook.  I've been there, uh, about a year and a half now, maybe.  Maybe closer to two years.  I'm not really sure.  And, uh, the, the, the, the design of the page is what fucking is horrible. 
[00:35:00]  Isn't that annoying?  They figure that out?  Yeah, it's crazy.  Get some people that know that shit, and you could save Facebook.  I still don't know what the fuck is going to have to do.  I don't even know what I'm looking at.  Like, I'll, I'll do, I'll, I'll have two updates.  One's right at the top, and the other one's like, I don't know, the, the eighth one down  on the right side now.  I'm like, what?  There's no rhyme or reason to it.  It doesn't make no sense.  It fucking, Shelby sent you an invite.  Fuck you, Shelby.  I don't want to go.  I want to talk to people I know.  So-and-so sent you a pillow fight invite. 
[00:35:30]  Well, so-and-so should get leukemia.  I don't fight with pillows.  But it's how the page, when you go to your Facebook page, how it looks.  It's not inviting.  And you can't work the fan page properly.  No, of course not.  Those fucking idiots, and their fucking app still-  Still stinks.  The fucking stock is half of what it was, and this fucking cunt won't fix his app.  Still stinks.  And then people, you know, write comments and stuff, and I want to, like, you know, reply  to them.  I don't know where those replies go, because I want it right next to the one. 
[00:36:00]  You can't do that.  Stinks, dude.  You can't have it as a sub thing that happens, only if it's the last one that commented.  It's just stupid.  Yeah, it's terrible.  They deserve everything that's going to happen to them, because, look, we're looking at it  now.  What is all that shit, Danny?  What is that?  I swear it's-  Hold on.  I got some app requests that are outstanding.  Hang on.  I don't want app requests.  Marianne wants me to play Buggle.  I don't want-  Tell Marianne to fuck herself with a stick.  Wait.  Go play Buggle. 
[00:36:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's sort out.  Buggle.  What is Buggle, though?  It sounds like it might be fun.  I don't know.  But Alan wants me to play Township.  Who wants you to play Township?  Alan.  Tell Alan to go fuck his mother.  Alan stinks.  And Rob invited me to try Into Now.  What's Into Now?  Get more from TV.  Connect with your friends and show the TV.  Oh, these sound like-  These sound like-  Why should you be bothered?  That's the only thing that can make money.  They sound like fun.  I got some more.  Beth wants me to check out Disney's Ghosts of Mistwood.  Hey, I like the one on the bottom. 
[00:37:00]  What's that?  Oh, that's Dice with Buddies.  Hey, it's Dice with Buddies.  Hey, look.  It's my buddies.  Come here, Jake.  Let's go out.  Who are your friends?  Dice?  My buddies.  Like Happy Face?  Happy Face.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Wheels.  Wheels.  Todd.  Dice with Buddies.  No, that one I would play.  But the pages, I just, I update mine, but I don't enjoy it at all. 
[00:37:30]  It's really all about Twitter.  I really don't like it at all.  Betsy wants you to guess the weight of her hysterectomy organs.  You can win some jelly beans.  If we didn't know any better, that Facebook page, what year is that from?  You know what I mean?  The design of it.  Like maybe-  Well, I guess the-  Early 2000s.  It's about 10 years behind.  Too busy, man.  Yeah, some of the things, give it away is new, but a lot of things really have that old  feel to it because like the amount of advertising that is on this page these days. 
[00:38:00]  Well, just the white background.  No one uses a white background.  What's on the left end?  What's all that shit under your picture?  Thank you.  It's all that shit.  There's favorites, and then there's the ads manager, and then there's pages, and then  groups, and then there's apps, and then there's more.  You should be able to clean your page up where you only have to look at two or three things,  and I understand a couple of ads so they can make up money.  And then what they do also is you have this ticker, which you can open up on the right-hand  side, and so that's kind of like, it's like a, it's like a, it's like, you know, picture 
[00:38:30]  in picture?  That's like Facebook in Facebook.  It's just like if the regular Facebook is too confusing for you, you can just open this  up, and this works like a stock ticker.  It's ridiculous.  I don't understand what this has become.  Yes, Irock?  Anytime we post something on the O&A Facebook, it gives you the option now of, do you want  to make this an ad for $75 so that anyone that likes our page, it'll show up on the  right-hand side each post like a banner ad?  So they want to charge, they want you to pay for every time you post something to make  it like a commercial. 
[00:39:00]  Well, if it's an ad, I understand that, like, because they have to make money.  It's like Twitter has to find a way to monetize if they're going to die.  You have to make money.  And like, I paid for one ad one time to promote something.  It's like $300.  On what?  No, on what?  Twitter?  Facebook?  On Facebook.  And it might have been...  Did it work?  Hard, I mean...  It's hard to tell.  For Epix, it did very well, the special.  I mean, but I just wanted to do something a little bit extra.  The Oapster might be interested in this.  Yeah.  For the amount of money that you paid.  Get a few more extra views on those viral videos of the Oapsters. 
[00:39:30]  For what you end up paying for, like, you might as well just go with Google Ads.  Yeah, honestly.  But I didn't mind doing it because I felt like it's showing you how many pages you're exposed  to, and if it works, it works.  What's the Trump announcement, you think?  Oh, it's just going to be awesome.  New season of The Apprentice?  Yeah.  Is it going to be something about...  I talked to a nurse in Hawaii.  Yeah.  Is it something about the birth certificate?  Oh, who cares?  What could he possibly have?  Nothing.  Why is he teasing it if it's that important? 
[00:40:00]  Why wouldn't you just do it?  Why does it have to be this whole thing?  Say it.  Why does it always have to be this thing with him?  It's a thing with him.  And then his son is so down to earth and nice.  There are different people there.  I don't know if I necessarily agree with all his politics, but as a person, I like Donald  Trump's son a lot.  And congratulations on him, by the way.  He had another kid.  Did he really?  Oh, that's nice.  I don't know.  I think Sunday.  I believe it was Sunday.  So congratulations.  Oh.  He's so different than his father, though, man. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, the Donald just loves publicity.  And actually, I like the Donald, too.  He's like a fucking man.  But he's sort of, I mean, for a billionaire, he's kind of cartoony.  He really is.  He's, when you think back to how long he's been around and in the public eye as kind of  a showman builder guy.  Mogul.  It's a weird thing.  I remember being, I thought, maybe I was in my 20s, but I felt like I was a kid coming 
[00:41:00]  into the city.  We'd go to that Trump building on, what, Fifth Avenue.  Yeah.  Beautiful inside.  And then he had that first book of his.  Yeah.  Do you remember the first book?  I forgot the name of it.  Was it just called Trump?  I think it was Trump.  I heard parking is $700-something a month in that fucking building.  Really?  It's in Columbus Circle.  I mean, it's prime real estate.  Columbus Circle.  Is that the one you mean?  No, I'm talking about the one, I believe it was on Fifth Avenue.  All of that big, okay, I'm thinking the one in Columbus.  The one that's been around forever, I'm talking about.  Okay, that's the original. 
[00:41:30]  He's got to be 25 years old at this point, I would assume.  Maybe more.  That's where he lives.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one.  Yeah, there's the original book.  Oh, Art of the Deal, yeah.  Art of the Deal, of course.  That's when everyone started knowing him.  That book did very, very well.  He's a smart guy, man.  He's not a, again, he knows how to make his fucking name have value.  And it sounds like a dumb thing to say, but when you look at real estate, it's  like Trump's name, people have faith in it because you know stuff's going to be well  maintained, his buildings don't go to shit, that people who work in them are competent, 
[00:42:00]  like, he's just, he's really smart with that stuff.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, well, his big announcement's tomorrow.  Whatever that is.  I don't know.  Whatever it is.  Oh, we have a lot of guests today.  We got D.L. Hughley coming in in a few minutes.  I love D.L., but we have one guest.  The big show.  He's cute.  The big show.  Me and I get to go home early today because Peter Criss is coming in.  I will handle that one.  I'm not going to sit here and just stare at him as you talk to him for a half hour straight. 
[00:42:30]  It's going to be wonderful.  I wouldn't miss watching Jimmy talk to Peter Criss.  Wait, this is the first time we've met him.  No, I've never spoken to him other than a quick photo.  Did we have Peter Criss back then when they all came in?  I don't think so.  No, I think we did.  At NAW, the big interview where they all came in.  Dude, I didn't sleep last night.  I was fucking tossing and turning.  He's a gun-packing fucking animal.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Probably the most revealing, and I swear to you, probably the most revealing fucking rock book. 
[00:43:00]  You've read the whole thing already?  Oh, I fucking...  Give us one.  That really...  A story that...  This is just his mentality.  This is not even a great big...  This is just why he didn't like going to dinner with Kiss during the reunion tour.  Oh.  What year is this now?  Because there were a lot of reunion tours.  I think this was the 03 or 04 around there.  Okay, fair.  Enough.  He was just talking about how much he didn't enjoy it.  He was saying, uh, they weren't my people anymore.  You had one pompous asshole in Jean, a supreme egotist who would drool over every woman in the restaurant. 
[00:43:30]  If the waitress was attractive, he would take her hand and lick it and try to give her his room number.  It was so embarrassing.  He'd be wearing his stupid Kiss baseball hat to cover his balding, weaved hair.  That is this great song.  He used to have this weave that looked like Davy Crockett hat.  It looked like birds were living on his head.  And his stupid cap would sit on top of it because it couldn't fit over that plugged-up monstrosity.  Holy fuck!  That is the tone of the book. 
[00:44:00]  And that's sort of how me and Ann think of Gene Simmons.  But he's...  We've seen it ourselves in the few times he's been in here.  He's rather brutal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's rather brutal.  That is fantastic.  But what is that based on?  He feels like he got screwed over as far as money goes?  Many times, yeah.  Because Ace Frehley thinks pretty much the same as Peter Criss at this point.  Oh, boy, is there some good stuff about Ace, too.  What do you mean?  In the book?  Yeah.  I'll ask Peter about it.  Oh, I can't wait for this interview, man.  Yeah, there's a couple of amazing things that he says that I'm... 
[00:44:30]  But the fact that he talks like that, and the tone he takes when writing about things that  he's angry about, I just like the honesty of his opinions.  Oh, I got a question for you that I need to know.  Sure.  The whole Beth thing.  Because even Gene Simmons tried to take credit for Beth, even though it's Peter Criss' song.  Well, it was called Beck originally.  But Gene said something about it that didn't sound right.  So I said, let's go with Beth, even though Peter Criss wrote the entire fucking song. 
[00:45:00]  Well, I think Peter addressed that.  I think it was the producer of Destroyer, I believe, was Bob Ezrin, who's a genius producer.  They said he was a coke head.  Peter tells whoever was a coke head, Peter said they were a coke head.  And apparently, this guy did a lot of coke, but was brilliant, and figured out the tempo  of Beth.  And I think it was Ezrin that said the change.  We'll ask him when he comes in.  Gene Simmons tried to take credit for work.  Not on our show.  Peter, I'm sure he'll have something to say about it.  Well, E-Rod, can you find that clip?  Do you remember? 
[00:45:30]  Were you listening?  Yeah, I don't have anything from the old NEW stuff where you had everybody in.  No, that's fine.  No, this is newer stuff.  Yeah, he wasn't listening.  That shit's hilarious.  What were you asking for?  Yeah, you were asking for Gene Simmons stuff with Peter Criss.  What?  What Gene Simmons stuff?  Yeah.  All right, that part.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Coke, flow, drink my Coke. 
[00:46:00]  At this second, I was giving DL's breakfast order to the intern who's downstairs.  Why would you do that?  Oh, boy.  Because I was told to give it to him.  Well, how about somebody...  This right...  Not yelling at Iraq.  Yeah.  This right here is the type of fucking shit.  Stop with only Iraq talks to the interns.  Yeah.  Iraq's kind of got to...  Because that's not Iraq's fault.  He's been told to do that.  We're on here.  He's in the nerve center.  He can't be like doing...  What the fuck?  How about somebody else gives the fucking order to the interns? 
[00:46:30]  Well, our guy on the board pays attention to the show.  Yeah, he's got to pay attention.  It's hard enough.  No disrespect, Iraq, but you are a blithering fool.  Coke, float in my cup.  Coke, float in my cup.  That's not Eric's fault.  He was told he's the only one who can speak to the interns.  Yeah.  So how about that changes so this doesn't have to happen?  You talk to the radio wizard.  Iraq intern, nigga.  Yeah, I don't pitch anymore, if you haven't noticed. 
[00:47:00]  I'm all good now.  But I just wanted Beth Clips, and all of a sudden the fucking...  Iraq, what we're looking for is...  Gene talking about Beth.  Yes.  I don't have that one isolated.  Okay.  No, you need to find that.  Yeah, I'm looking for it.  It's kind of important for today's interview.  We have time.  He's not until 9.30.  I'll find it.  Yeah, please find it for after the break, because I want to hear exactly what Gene...  Because we brought up Beth, and then, of course, Gene had to make the whole Beth thing  about himself, even though everyone knows it's a Peter Criss song.  Can I tell you how much that must drive him crazy?  Gene Simmons?  The biggest song in their history, as far as that's concerned. 
[00:47:30]  That has pretty much nothing to do with Gene Simmons.  Yeah, it was Beth.  Pretty much.  And his balding weave.  Oh, dude.  Oh, is that fucking nasty?  I actually...  And he talks about, like, you know, a lot of guys will gloss over how they felt during  a moment.  Yeah.  It's...  The things he says are fucking brutally...  Whether or not he's right or wrong, at least he's saying honestly how he felt.  I would imagine he's pretty accurate.  Oh, hell yeah.  I would imagine.  I would, too. 
[00:48:00]  It looks like Ace and Peter, at this point, are done with Kiss, right?  I don't even know if they're...  Yeah.  Yeah.  But there have been times in the past where they were sort of done and they came back.  But when you hear the money that they got compared to, like...  He talks a lot about feeling very fucked over financially, even in these later times.  And there was plenty of money for everybody.  Plenty of money.  Right?  Plenty of money.  How much less did he make than Gene?  Oh, my God.  I think at one point, he said, and this was almost stopped the reunion tour, was in 2000 
[00:48:30]  or whatever when it came...  Or 2003, whenever it happened.  No, 2000...  Or 96, I'm sorry, because I went with Jeff Ross to Philly.  96.  Is that when we went to Boston and saw that?  It probably was around when that was happening.  That was the first reunion tour?  That was the first one started in Detroit.  Yeah, okay.  Gene and Paul...  So, and again, Gene and Paul kept KISS going.  Like, if Peter was gone and Ace was gone by 82...  Fair enough.  I think they should get a little extra bucks.  I wouldn't argue that point.  It's the difference that I want to know about.  But is it crazy, right? 
[00:49:00]  They were taking 70%, 35 each.  And they were giving Ace 20 and Peter 10%.  And Peter said, I'm not making less than Ace.  I'm not...  Me and Ace can make the same.  What was their reasoning?  Uh, I think their reasoning was that something to do with Ace just won a big guitar award or something.  There was some weird reason they gave...  That's sleazy, man, because Beth...  That, according to Peter...  That song, Beth got him to places. 
[00:49:30]  Obviously a big band kiss.  Can't take it away from it.  Man.  But Beth puts them on a whole other stage when you have a fucking pop song like that.  It just...  That everyone knew.  Man.  They've sold over 100 million records.  I mean, they were...  They're fucking...  And again, Paul and Gene kept the band going.  But to the reunion tour, he wound up getting more.  Him and Ace...  He said he wound up talking to Ace.  And they...  They fixed it.  And Ace was actually cool going, look, man.  Because Ace was fucking...  You know how Ace comes in?  So Ace knocked down his percent to take care of Peter Criss? 
[00:50:00]  And they did something to do with the percent.  They might have gotten more from Kiss.  I don't know.  We can ask Peter that.  I just don't know.  But you know how Ace comes in and he's kind of fun.  Like, hey, man.  You know, he's a little nutty.  And he's a great guy.  That fucking big cocked monster couldn't stick his dick in a girl's ass fast enough.  What?  What, Ace?  Yes!  With his big giant cock.  Is that in the book?  Of course it is!  Oh, that's fantastic.  I knew he had the biggest cock in Kiss.  Who wouldn't fucking buy this book? 
[00:50:30]  Dude, I'm not overselling it.  This book...  I felt like I was just fucking drinking liquid gold every page.  Fucking...  Good for Peter Criss.  I fucking love...  Most of those books suck because they don't want to be honest.  Because they don't want to be honest.  They don't want to say things that they feel.  And I like the fact that he said things he felt.  God, is that fucking great.  You know, they offer...  This is how much I want to interview Peter Criss.  I was supposed to do Leno Friday.  I mean, tomorrow.  And then they cancelled me because Obama's on.  So they said, can you do Friday? 
[00:51:00]  And I said, I can't because I'm working Helium in Philly.  Plug.  But then they're like, could you do a Tuesday?  And I said, no.  So I could be doing the Tonight Show tonight.  And I said, no.  I'm interviewing Peter Criss.  Now watch him cancel.  It would serve me right.  Fanboy jizzbucket I am.  Instead of thinking about my career.  That's later on this morning.  Right around the corner, D.L. Hughley.  Yes, D.L. is coming in.  And the Big Show coming in today.  He's just a monster.  We've never met the Big Show.  We will today.  No?

Donald Sutherland smelled great  Donald Sutherland  You got his  Yeah, it smelled great  Speaking of  The other night I was doing  The Stewards  You know, his roast  His celebrity telethon  Right  Night of too many stars  Night of too many stars  Right  And Al Pacino  Who doesn't want to meet Al Pacino?  I was telling Auntie Al Pacino  Where you get to take a picture  With Al Pacino  For your Christmas card  Pretty funny bit  He walked into a wall  Like right there 
[00:57:30]  Oh shit  And I saw it  And I was like  Oh my god  Michael Corleone  Just walked into a wall  And it fucked me up the whole day  Like I'm like  Oh my god  I just watched  He really did  Just walked into a wall  Walked into a wall  Like  What's that about your thing?  Like an old dude  Walked into a wall  Oh man  Like this is hilarious  Did you meet him?  He certainly is no kid  I right there  Right after there  So what  You could get your picture  With him for a Christmas card  What a great idea  It was a bit they were doing  You know  To the highest bidder  It was a pretty funny bit  How much did he go for?  Louis CK was the one  That was getting the bid  I like 20 grand right? 
[00:58:00]  20  Yeah  20,000  Because Louis wanted it  To be 25  But he wanted it  To take it off his hand  And they did  Louis  No  But Louis had to pay his 25  Did he?  Yes  Did he get it?  He didn't get the picture though  Yes he did  I was watching at home  I thought the family  Got the picture  And then Louis came in  Oh  I took a picture  With Al Pacino  It was all awkward  After he walked into a wall  I was done  You were done  Oh boy  After I found out  About the Boy Scouts  Fucking all those kids  I was done with them  That actually made me  Want to support them  Finally 
[00:58:30]  They're admitting it  I never trusted them  Anytime somebody wears  Tight shorts  And a kerchief  I was a Cub Scout  Thank God  I had no interest  In the boy  I stopped  I stopped  It's the lower  It's like the minor leagues  I think down there  They only just like  Kind of breathe on your pee pee  When you come on the Scoutmaster  Once your son  Is to teach your son  How to start a fight  With two dicks  You know  Are you sure you're saying that right?  Yeah  No  No  You rub them together 
[00:59:00]  Real hard  And they go to sleep  I remember even  You rub them together  Real hard  Then light a match  I remember even  As a little kid  That just seemed like  A weird world  That I didn't really  I tried it  And I was like  Nah this isn't for me  I was out  And the thing about it is  The people that are the most  The organizations that are the most  Opposed to gay people  Are generally  The places full of gay  Of course  They're all gay  It's like  Because any dude that wants to be around children 
[00:59:30]  And it ain't court ordered  Sure  Yeah there's always an odd thing  They hook themselves up  In those weird positions  Of you know  Soccer coach  Right  And fucking  Yeah yeah  I'm just volunteering my time  Yeah where's your son  No no  He's  He's out of the house  I can't go to college  Yeah  I can't fuck him  He'd tell  His mother would never go for that  I like  I like being a father  But I can't imagine  Being around  Like other kids 
[01:00:00]  No man  You're onto something there  I'm very  Like when my kids  Were growing up  And they were in the house  And they would have company  I was very  Aware  And always had somebody around  That was an adult  Yeah yeah yeah  Just one of those little fuckers  Snapped and said  He touched me  Exactly  You know what I mean  But I grew up next to a pedophile  Did you  And little kids  You're sitting next to one now  Not registered  Kids would leave the house  Crying and with candy in here  And like true story  And they were like 
[01:00:30]  Do you want candy?  No motherfucker  Not that bad  Like  Cause booty for Skittles  Is not a deal  That's not optimal  It is a strange  Situation  But is that  Based on  Really  Your neighbor  That really happened  And did you see some shit  I wouldn't ever see it  Or some suspicion  No no  Everybody knew  Everyone knew  His wife knew  Everybody knew  And my father said  Don't you ever go over here  And kids would leave the house  Like it was always these dudes 
[01:01:00]  Who wanted money  Or whatever  And they would come out  With this dazed look  On their face  And you know  And I was like  Wow  Is this what  Even money does  No one was protecting us  When we grew up  Yeah yeah no  You can't get away  With this shit  Not now  Where everyone knows  Not now  I can only imagine  What his house looked  Like around Halloween  Probably fun  Spotlights  Like those big movie  Premiere lights  Come here  Look at all those toys  They look so fun  It's a tunnel of love  Did he ever get caught?

[01:02:00]  Boy Scouts  I mean is there like  A lot of black kids  In Boy Scouts  Or is it mostly white kids  It was like  But they were like  They were like  Kids that  Like I knew an Eagle Scout  Like he was an Eagle Scout  Turned into an Eagle Scout  But it's just  Going away on camping trips  With dudes with tight shorts  And curtships  Like strange dudes  No good could come  Like staying in tents  Yeah  Oh shit  Why are you bringing  KY Jelly  They're for bugs  I just never thought  That that was a good look  So I never 
[01:02:30]  I never liked  Any of those  Civic minded  Kind of  Yeah it didn't look  It didn't look  Cool enough military  I mean if it was like  You know  If you looked like  You were fucking  Some kind of Navy SEAL  Or something like that  That might be cool  But yeah the shorts  It looked like  You were wearing  Some kind of  Bastardized later hosen  Or something  And it was always  Like they always  Had to go away  At the most fun times  And they would come back  Like my friends  Who were in it  Would come back  And it would be  Fucking cold  Like black kids  From the city

It's Comedy Central 
[01:06:30]  October 27th  I'm trying to get the black man  Put on the endangered species list  Jesus  The two best things we did  Was once we talked to  A Klansman  Out of Detroit  Because you know  Every species needs  You know  A natural predator  Uh huh  These people that depend  Are into dependency  So you know  He needs  Like if black people go away  Just hating Mexicans and Jews  Would not be enough  That's like the appetizer  Yeah yeah 
[01:07:00]  So we talked to him  And tried to get him  To sign a petition  To save the black man  And he would not do it  To save the people  He wouldn't do it  He wouldn't do it  And then we talked to  The private prison industry  Uh people for the  You know the private  They own private prisons  And what they can do  Is they can  They can get  Buy prisoners  They can say  Give me six of those  Oh nice  Yeah so they can get  And what they want  Is young  Um  Healthy prisoners  With long lengthy prison systems  So 
[01:07:30]  It's like slavery  And so what we did  Is we talked to them  And got the established  Wait why would they want  The prisoners  To do work prior  Well because  They get paid  On occupancy  Like hotels  Wow  Like Expedia  So  They sent letters  To 48 states  Saying  If you  Let us have your prisons  And let us run your prisons  We will do it at X price  And all we ask  Is 90% occupancy  And  They can actually  Bid on prisoners  They can say  We won  And so we 
[01:08:00]  We got that information  Then we went out  And talked to gang members  Who had a couple of strikes  And knew they were going to prison  And bought them stock  In a private prison company  So  So  When they go to jail  They'll not only be inmates  But they'll be shareholders  So  It was just  But it's really  It's funny  And sad  But  Then we talked to a preacher  Who  Was trying to get black kids  You know  To get a black kid adopted  It's hard  People will pay $100,000  Up to $100,000  To skip  Adopting black kids  Oh shit  To skip  Like white kids 
[01:08:30]  It's very hard to get them  It's like  They're like the iPhone 5  They're like  They're never in stock  Have you ever tried  To adopt a white child  Have you seen how long it takes  Give us your name  And we'll email you  When some come in  Yeah  Get here early  Because I'm sure  It's a shipment coming  Like black kids  Is not  Like  You have a Groupon  For this palette  Of black kids  It's a palette  They was horrible  Holy shit  And the only people  Who actively adopt  Group that actively 
[01:09:00]  Adopts black kids  Is gay  Family  Oh really  Yeah  Gay couples  So gay couples  Wow  I think I've seen that  On a few shows  Because they're available  I guess  Right  Because they're like  They want families  And they don't really care  Because it's probably  Hard for them  To adopt a white kid  Still  Right  Yeah  So they have to go  To the  They have to go  They've got to go deep  Yeah  They've got to go to the  Deep  Yeah  Got to go deep  In the pile  It's so sad  No 
[01:09:30]  Someone in my family  Is going through  The adoption process  I know exactly  What you're talking about  They basically told them  Look  You know  If you want a kid  We can get you one  Tomorrow  You want it fast  Or you want it white  Thanks very much  That should be the new  Adoption slogan  You want it fast  Or you want it white  Oh my god  But they basically said  Blonde blue eyes  At least a year  Yeah  Wow  But they mentioned  A few others  And said  Three months  Yeah 
[01:10:00]  Four months  My manager  You know Dave  Becky  Oh yeah  My manager  He when he was  Adopting kids  He you know  Went and told me  This true story  I said  He wanted a kid  You know  Because they all  Ambitious  You know  You want kids  That look  Ideally like you  And so they wanted  A white kid  And they were like  That's impossible  We don't ever get them  No one's ever even  Seen one of them  It's like  It's like a pink diamond  It's like that special  Baseball car  That never comes  The Honest Wagner baby 
[01:10:30]  I'll take a white child  A unicorn  And an Easter bunny  Bigfoot  Yeah  Bigfoot  So eventually  He just gave up  On that idea  And they ended up  Getting you know  Half Latin  Half white  So it can almost be  You know  And I said  He said how long  You know  If I want any kid  How long for that  She said  You could have a black kid  Like right now  I'm pretty sure  Have a nice selection  In the trunk  Off the rack  Yeah  It was so sad to me 
[01:11:00]  And my wife wants to adopt kids  And I could never do it  Yeah  I could never do it  Why  Because I wouldn't really love them  Nah  I know I wouldn't  Nah  I wouldn't take care of them  I could be functional  I could you know  Make sure you ate  Go to college  Right  Hey scooter  Say stuff like that  But like when it came to the hard stuff  Why does nobody love me  Well something  You know  Some people don't get love  Oh shit  Some people don't get love 
[01:11:30]  You got food  You got a roof over your head  Right  Yeah  Right  And he would be 17 and a half  Like six good months  Before it's time to go  It's like  Alright  It's time for you to get the fuck out  Yeah  Holy shit  It's your birthday  Goodbye  Yeah take it easy  What'd you get me for my 18th birthday?  Luggage  A lot of brochures  I've given you the best weeks of my life  It's time for you to leave  Like my wife  Like my  I think I  My wife 
[01:12:00]  I have a niece  And she has four kids  She's 21  22 now  Four  And she had a real bad drug habit  Stayed in California  Took her kids  My wife gets in the process  And so they have to come out  And evaluate your home  Like they have to  See how much food you have  Home visit  Yeah  You have to get a gate around the pool  And like  You have to get a carbon monoxide monitor  Like  And I'm like  Why?  Well a little protecting from fumes  I'm like  These motherfuckers just came from a crack house  Fuck fumes are gonna be that bad 
[01:12:30]  That's a great point  How can methane  Possibly be as bad  Should be able to  Should be able to keep him in the doghouse  Right  Still gonna be better than where he came from  So they got all like  And they were like  Oh  So you know  They thought I was being kind of  You know  Weird about the rules  And it was just like  When we had kids  We never got  You were in California  You're supposed to get a gate  Or a monitor  But we taught our kids to swim 
[01:13:00]  And  Yeah  That's the rule  Like  And part of the graduation  Is you have to knock them in the pool  When they're not  When they're not  You know  Oh wow  Not ready for it  So my two year old  Who's my  My daughter  She's a  I call her  She has her  Sundress on  And her hair  And her lottipop  And little sandals  Oh  Oh no  And not to be mean  But you're supposed to do it  Like  Come to daddy  And she fell  And knocked her into the pool 
[01:13:30]  Boy  It was  My wife  I'm a Jesus  20 years later  She marries a guy  Who just throws water on her  I guess that's to make sure  They can swim  In their panic  Right  Right  She panicked for a while  And then she got it  And got out of the pool  And how old was she?  Two  Yeah  We already started  Swimming lessons from my kid  What do they teach babies  To like lay on their back  And cry and float?  They teach them  They do right?  Yeah  But she could swim 
[01:14:00]  But she freaked out  Because he wasn't  Yeah you're not expecting it  There's somebody  I watch in the pool  In my building  There's a guy  He teaches the kids to swim  And he comes in  And he doesn't seem  Like a pedophile at all  But he really does  And he's  But he's  The way he's  Like he's got their hands  On the stomach  And the parents are right there  But I'm like  It must be weird  To see your child  Being touched like that  It's weird to see somebody  Reaching to your woman's ass  To get a baby out  That's kind of weird  Like if you're kind of going deep  What are you grabbing?  That's kind of weird 
[01:14:30]  Like the first time  You go for an examination  Like where they put the glove on  And like a fist full of KY jelly  And they're talking to you  While they're fingering your wife  Is it hard not to go  Is it hard not to go  Oh man  Yeah it's a little  Wow  Why are you in the  Why are you in there  With the doctor doing that?  Well you have to  Like for the first time  You have a kid  You have to  Be supportive  Supportive is one thing  But shit like that 
[01:15:00]  I still think it should be  Like it was in the 50s  I do too  Where you just  The guy isn't even  At the doctor  He's just  You go to the bar  Home with those pals  And I'm a black man  I just hope to be there  When they're born  In their life  I want to show up  Before they win  The Heisman Trophy  Yeah you're doing  You're doing way more  Than you have to  It was horrible  It was horrible  So where were we at  With the election  We got two weeks left  What's your thoughts?  Well the first  Debate was so 
[01:15:30]  Bomber got his ass kicked  I'd never have seen  It was uncomfortable right?  It was like wow  What the fuck do you think  Was going on with him?  I don't know  It's just like he  I actually think  It was his anniversary  And his wife  Was giving him the side eye  Oh man  I think she was mad  Like you  Like 20 year anniversary  You out fucking around  Trying to be president  That's hilarious  That was like  That it doesn't matter  If it's this little thing  That he's doing  That fucked up the anniversary  Or having a debate  Yeah  To get re-elected  She's just another wife 
[01:16:00]  And I don't think  I think when you get  Your ass whipped like that  You're not getting no pussy  That's just not  You know  And you can't even  Shout at her  Hey girl  Hey why didn't you  Use some of that fucking  What was all that vigor  When you were arguing  I said vigor  So let me get that clear  But I think that  He just  I've never seen  Anybody  That is that bright  Do that  Like  It was very  Lackadaisical  As they say  Just kind of  Stood there  Didn't seem like 
[01:16:30]  He was paying attention  He seemed very mentally off  Yeah  Very mentally off  And I'm like  You're not a Mormon  Have some coffee  Yeah  You can have cafe  And then I thought  The second was  He  You know  He won  But I thought  Last night  Romney  Basically played  The role  He played  The first time  I don't think  It was that bad  No not that bad  But I'm saying  Because there'll never be  Anything  Yeah that was  Pretty fucking bad  I think it's very hard  For a challenger  To challenge  An incumbent 
[01:17:00]  On foreign affairs  It's kind of  His job  Now you've got  A guy that  His job  Is taking care  Of foreign affairs  He's done it  For four years  Right  Regardless of  What kind of job  You think he's done  He's been in the forum  And now you've got  Another guy  That's been governor  That hasn't really  Had to deal  With foreign affairs  It's kind of hard  To step into that role  And sound  Better than the guy  That's got the gig  And I will say this  That you know  I don't think he's  The devil  Or bad  Or anything  I do think  That he'll say  Anything  Like last night  I never said 
[01:17:30]  Let Detroit go bankrupt  Motherfucker  Yes you did  But that's a whole  I think there's a lot  Of dishonesty  On both parts  With that bankruptcy  Thing  He said  Go into bankruptcy  Protection  American Airlines  Did it  Fucking  A lot of the  Airlines did it  If a car company  Can't run a business  And make money  File for bankruptcy  Protection  Get yourself  In order  And then  Get out of bankruptcy  Except nobody  From the private sector  Was willing to  Lend at that time  There was  Nobody was going to lend 
[01:18:00]  It was such a  Financially turbulent time  That the idea  Of getting money  It's their businesses  That have been around  For decades  That couldn't get financing  Because  There was nobody  To lend  The car company  The government  Had to do  During the debate  Last night  They had a little  Issue as to  Whether Romney  Had ever said  That there should be  Some kind of  Government backing  After they filed  For bankruptcy  Because it was so hard  To get loans  At the time  And Obama said 
[01:18:30]  He never said that  That Romney  Had never said that  But it turned out  Romney did say that  That's true  And it did end up  So both sides  Will just throw  I was waiting to hear  You know  Liar liar  Pants on fire  At some point  Because they both  Are throwing shit out there  And they're both  Calling each other out  Romney's neck  Do you think  When President Obama  Gets up there  And says  About his job record  That there's  Four and a half  Five million jobs 
[01:19:00]  That he's created  I was making an analogy  That that's like  Me going to Atlantic City  Dropping ten thousand dollars  Winning five thousand  And saying I won five thousand  In Atlantic City  I didn't  So that is dishonest  And it doesn't  It's  It's deliberately misleading  I will agree  But I'll say this  When Mitt Romney goes  Government can't create jobs  But then turns around  And goes  I who run the government  Will create twelve million dollars  That's the  Twelve million jobs  That's the biggest  Bunch of bullshit 
[01:19:30]  I've ever heard  Government can't create jobs  But if I were in charge  Of the government  I would be able to  Create twelve million dollars  That's another  Kind of soundbite clip  Obviously  Him being a  Businessman  And very business oriented  I think him  In the position  Of president  And being in the government  Would know  What policies  The government  Could put in place  Where businesses  Can prosper  Not  I'm the government  I'll create  Twelve million jobs  Right  But I'm the government  I'll put certain things 
[01:20:00]  In place  That will foster  An environment  Where jobs can grow  But all the things  That he did  When he was a businessman  Are exactly the problem  For the American worker  When he outsourced  He made money  By leveraging companies  With debt  By straddling them  With debt  Breaking them up  And selling them off  That's how he made money  Certain companies  A lot of them  Certain companies  That weren't  Financially viable  Even were  KB Toys  Was okay  It wasn't  Financially viable  But it wasn't  It wasn't  In the fucking 
[01:20:30]  KB Toys  Is the most  Ghetto fucking  Toys  And that's why  I know it  That ain't no  Toys  Wait a minute  Pal  Wait a minute  I used to love  Toys  And I would  Walk right past  Fucking KB  With a bunch of  Shit on those shelves  Are you kidding me  I live in KB Toys  I got my first  Train set  From KB Toys  It didn't work  But I got it  God damn it  A lot of  Black G.I.  Joes  In KB Toys  A lot of  Black G.I. 
[01:21:00]  Joe  You can't really  Tell G.I.  Joe is black  Nah  He was all  Gruff and rugged  Anyway  Except when he  Laid on his stomach  Like he was shooting  The black guy  Was up a little  And the gun  Was sideways  And they were  In a car  A little  Difference  It's changed  To a gold  So who wins  This election  You think Obama's  Got this  Their deal  I would assume  He's the one 
[01:21:30]  You want right  Definitely  But I think  That this is  What I imagine  I think that  It'll be  Really close  Really close  I think that  He's heading  Iowa  Ohio  Wisconsin  And I don't  Know about  Florida  Or  Virginia  And I think  That you could  Have a situation  Where Obama  Wins the  Electoral college  And Romney  Wins the popular  That does  Seem to be  Something that  Is  Looks like  That could  Happen  When was the 
[01:22:00]  Last time  That happened  2000  Yeah  Yeah  Did Gore win  The popular  Vote  Oh yeah  In the end  He did  And then of  Course  And if that  Happens this  Time  I don't think  One democrat  Is going to  Come out  And say  The election  Was stolen  Yeah  Like they  Did  With Bush  And Gore  Well that's  The difference  Obama's brother  Is not the  Governor of  Ohio  Not the  Governor  He wasn't  At dinner  With him  When he  Went  Hey we  Lost  Florida  Hey let me  See about  That  And his  And his  And his  Father  Didn't  Appoint 
[01:22:30]  One of  The  Justices  That  Would  Decide  Very  Political  Family  You know  It's  Kind of  Hard  But other  Than that  But it  Does  It  Doesn't  I don't  Think they  Were put  In place  Years  Before  Just for  That  Occasion  By the way  Obama's  Father  A conspiracy  That  I don't  Think that  Either  But I  Think  It worked  In his  Favors  What  DL  Saying  I  Don't  Think  That  They  Went  I  Don't  Think  Obama  Was  Deliberty  Born  In  Ohio  So  He  Could  Be  President  I  Don't  Think  That  Either  By the  way  Obama's  Father  Much 
[01:23:00]  More  Fun  Than  Bush's  Father  Drinking  And  Driving  And  Fucking  Banging  Brugs  Much  More  Fun  Not  Meeting  Until  He  Was  10  Is  That  True  Yeah  Yeah  He met  Him  Once  I  Knew  He  Wasn't  The  Greatest  Father  But  I  Didn't  Know  That  And  Actually  Obama  Thought  I  Mean  The  Mother  Just  Sung  His  Praises  Obama  Thought  He  Was  A  Great  Man  He  Was  A  Bright  Dude 
[01:23:30]  Right  But  He  Was  Anti  Colono  The  Mother  Really  Like  Apparently  Talked  Him  Up  To  The  Young  Obama  The  Sister  Leveled  Him  When  She  Told  Him  Yeah  Yeah  What  The  Fuck  Are  You  Like  Treating  This  Guy  Like  A  God  When  He  Was  A  Piece  Of  You  Never  Have  To  Oh  Your  Father  Who  You  Never  Fucking  Seen  Was  A  Great  Guy  Your  Father  Is  A  Fucking  Deadbeat  He  He  He  The  Dick  You  Wrote  In  My  Mother

[01:52:00]  I  Put  A  Lot  Of  Time  In  With  It  They  Always  Wanted  Me  To  Play  Football  I  Was  7  Foot  313  As  A  Senior  In  High  School  And  Ran  A  5  Flat  40  And  Pads  So  It  Yeah  So  Everybody  Was  Like  Why  In  Hell  Aren't  You  Playing  Football  Because  Number  One  It  South  Carolina  There  There  There  Bugs

[01:53:30]  Had  A  Real  Bad  Experience  With  A  Coach  That  Was  Kind  Of  A  Dick  You  Know  What  I  Mean  What  Did  He  Do  To  You  Mean  Yeah  Just  Went  Through  A  Lot  Of  Stuff  With  This  Guy  He  Was  Just  Wasn't  A  Player  Coach  Was  More  Of  A  Just  An  Ass  I  Don't  Know  How  To  Explain  It  And  I  Just  You  Know  My  Attitude  Was  You're  Going  To  Need  Me  A  Long  Time  Before  I  Need  You  And  I  Wond  Up  Playing  My  Senior  Year  At  A  Different  School  Just 
[01:54:00]  Because  I  Like  The  Coach  And  He  Invited  Me  Out  To  Play  One  Time  And  My  Junior  Year  And  I  Didn't  Play  And  My  Senior  Year  Yeah  So  If  You  Want  To  Come  Out  You  Last  Year  Might  As  Well  Have  Some  Fun  So  Yeah  We  Went  To  State  Wow  So  Yeah  He  Was  A  Good  Coach  Coach  Rankin  At  The  School  I  Went  To  He  Had  Guys  With  Hair  Lips  Can  Usually  Fight 
[01:54:30]  Yeah  He  Was  Pretty  Rugged  He  Was  Pretty  Rugged  So  Good  Guy  And  When  You  Did  You  Ever  I  Mean  I  Know  What  Happened  With  Mayweather  Was  That  Wasn't  Expected  Was  It  To  Get  Popped  That  Hard  Let's  See  What  We  Do  Here  What's  The  Ethics  Of  This  I  Would  Say  That  I  Was  Very  Proud  Of  Mayweather  In  His  Ability  Promote  And  His  Ability  To  Really  Set  That  Angle  Off  Okay 
[01:55:00]  So  There's  Not  Many  People  That  Get  On  One  Knee  And  Let  Somebody  Blast  Them  In  The  Face  Yeah  Which  Is  Also  Humiliating  For  A  Boxer  Like  When  A  Guy  Will  Kneel  And  Let  You  Punch  Him  In  The  Face  That  Really  Just  Shows  You  The  Fucking  Pecking  Order  Of  Things  My  Wife  Ways  More  Than  Mayweather  My  Wife's  Like  5'10  159  I'm  Probably  Going  To  Eat  Peter  Barton  Jelly  For  A  Week  Now  The  Kids  I  Can't  Believe  You  Said  That  I  Don't  Bad  Anthony  You're  Tall  What  Do  You  Want  Me 
[01:55:30]  To  Say  Damn  I'm  In  Trouble  Did  You  Ever  Box  Before  I  Did  A  Little  Bit  Mainly  Getting  In  Shape  And  Tried  To  Venture  At  It  When  I  Took  A  Year  From  WWE  It  Didn't  Work  Out  Boxing  I  Have  A  Lot  Of  Respect  For  The  Tremendous  Dedication  Athletes  It's  Not  A  Sport  You  Jump  Into  At  35  But  It  Was  Cool  Getting  In  The  Ring  And  Training  And  Going 
[01:56:00]  Through  All  That  So  It  Definitely  Gave  Me  A  Lot  More  Respect  And  Understanding  For  The  Sport  It's  Definitely  A  Warrior  Sport  Yeah  What  Was  The  Hardest  Part  The  Speed  Because  A  No  How  Strong  You  Are  If  There's  A  Guy  Who  Can  Throw  Eight  Punches  Before  You  Go  On  Yeah  I  Think  So  But  Even  With  Reach  And  Stuff  Like  A  Lot  Of  It  Is  Just  What  They  Call  Unconscious  Competence  It's  A  Lot  Of  Seasoned  Boxers  Aren't  Thinking  About  What  They're  Going  To  Do  They're  Just  Reacting  And  Doing  It  And  When  You're  New  And  Trying  To  Do  It  You're 
[01:56:30]  Trying  To  Think  Oh  There's  A  Stomach  It's  Gone  There's  A  It's  Gone  You  Know  By  The  Time  Your  Thought  Process  Puts  It  Together  And  You've  Already  Missed  The  Opportunity  Wow  You  Know  And  I  Think  It's  One  Of  Things  Where  The  Boxing  Trainer  Made  Very  Clear  Says  You  Know  It 
[01:57:00]  Me  Appreciate  What  I  Do  I  Was  Amazed  With  The  Way  These  Guys  Move  Like  Cause  I  Hit  The  Heavy  Bag  Obviously  But  I  Can't  Move  No  It's  Just  Swings  Back  You're  Going  To  Go  Flying  But  I'm  Amazed  With  The  Fact  That  I  Just  Stand  There  And  Punch  It's  Just  For  Cardio  But  Like  When  You  See  Guys  Actually  Move  It's  Really  Hard  To  Move  And  Hit  A  Bag  Yeah  Well  If  You're  Hitting  The  Bag  Right  The  Bag  Doesn't  Move  Really  Yeah  Cause  If  You're  Moving  The  Bag  You're  Pushing  It  The 
[01:57:30]  Idea  Is  To  Pop  The  Bag  And  Transfer  Kinetic  Energy  From  Your  Fist  To  The  Bag  If  The  Bag  Swinging  All  You're  Doing  Is  Pushing  It  With  Your  Fist  You're  Not  Speeding  In  And  Popping  It  So  Hitting  It  Properly  Is  Transferring  Kinetic  Energy  From  Your  Heel  Through  Your  Hip  Through  Your  Shoulder  Through  Your  Elbow  Through  Your  Wrist  And  Transferring  Energy  In  The  Bag  So  It  All  Dumps  Into  The  Bag  And  Pulling  The  Fist  Back  Without  Pushing  It  I  Had to  Learn  To  Because  I  Was  Out  There  Just  Pushing  The  Bag  All 
[01:58:00]  Over  The  Place  You  Know  And  That's  Just  Not  The  Way  You  You  Hit  Hard  You  Hit  Quick  And  Something  You  Know  The  Other  Guys  Come  Right  Over  The  Top  Of  It  And  Cracking  You  In  The  Chin  I  I  I'm  Always  Amazed  When  They  Say  Well  He's  Timing  Him  Right  Now  He's  Timing  Him  It's  Like  How  Are  You  Thinking  That  When  There's  A  Guy  Trying  To  Knock  Your  Teeth  Out  Like  That's  That's  Part  Of  That  Unconscious  Confidence  Thing  I 
[01:58:30]  He  Shoulder  Drops  Before  He  Throws  A  Big  Right  Whatever  It  Is  You  Know  These  Guys  Are  Seas  And  They  Pick  Up  On  It  And  If  You  Don't  Know  What  You're  Doing  You'll  Just  Get  Your  Handed  To  You  So  I  Was  Amazed  During  The  Ali  Foreman  Fight  When  They  Were  Talking  About  The  Right  Hand  Leads  That  He  Threw  And  They  It  Is  A 
[01:59:00]  Slap  In  The  When  You  Cross  Your  Body  To  Hit  Somebody  Because  You're  Saying  That  He's  Slow  Enough  That  You  Can  Do  That  But  These  Guys  Actually  Think  That  That  That's  A  Disrespect  To  Throw  Across  Your  Body  To  Punch  Them  Yeah  Yeah  It  Is  Because  You're  You're  Leaving  Your  Open  It's  A  Slower  Punch  And  Basically  To 
[01:59:30]  My  Favorite  Was  Sugar  Ray  Robinson  Oh  Wow  He's  Just  I mean  I  Know  He's  From  An  Older  Era  But  Just  Watching  Some  Of  His  Old  Fights  How  Amazing  And  Fast  He  Was  How  He  He  Throw  These  Shuffle  Punches  To  The  Stomach  And  Then  He  Come  Back  With  Three  Four  Shuffle  Punches  To  Stomach  Left  Hook  Straight  Right  I  Mean  He  Was  Just  An  Amazing  Boxer  To  Watch  His  Combos  And  His  Footwork  And  You  Gotta  Figure  He  Was  Fighting  About 
[02:00:00]  Every  Week  Really  I  Mean  You  Used to  Fight a  Lot  More  Back  Oh  God  Yeah  He  Used to  Fight  All  The  Time  So  They  Were  Fighting  Rounds  To  They  Were  Putting  Them  In  There  My  Favorite  One  Of  His  Interviews  When  He  Lost  His  Title  To  Timberlake  Timberlake  The  Guy  From  Britain  I  Can't  Remember  His  Name  Timber  Something  Take  Him  A  Few  Rounds  And  Make  It  More  Entertaining  Something  Like  That

[02:05:00]  The  Years  It  Was  Insane  The  Fan  Response  From  The  Fans  In  Egypt  Were  Insane  I  Actually  Really  Felt  Famous  Over  There  Because  Everybody  Followed  Me  And  Took  Pictures  It  Wasn't  Just  Because  Oh  There's  An  Ogre  Kill  It  They  Actually  Knew  Who  I  Was  Big  Show  Is  Funny  That's  Hilarious  I  Saw  A  Documentary  It  Was  Morgan  Spurlock  Documentary  And  He's  Going  Into  All  These  Tiny  Little  Areas  Of  The  Middle  East  And  They're  All  Watching  Wrestling 
[02:05:30]  They  Got  The  Wrestling  T-shirts  On  They  Understand  Who  You  Are  Why  Do  You  Think  It's  So  Popular  Over  There  I  Don't  Know  That's  A  Good  Question  I  Think  Maybe  It's  Sports  Entertainment  Wrestling  Has  A  Lot  To  Offer  Our  Main  Thing  That  We  Offer  Is  A  Drama  That  Has  You  Know  Good  Guys  Overcoming  Adversity  You  Know  Little  Guys  Fighting  The  Good  Fight  You  Know  Maybe  That's  Kind  Of  A  Good 
[02:06:00]  Theme  For  People  I  Mean  You  Know  The  Infrastructure  In  Egypt  Is  Going  Through  Trouble  There's  A lot  Of  People  That  Are  Working  Very  Hard  And  Going  Through  A lot  Of  Things  Over  There  So  Maybe  That's  An  Escape  Who  Knows  If  Our  Product  Can  Bring  A  Little  Bit  Of  Happiness  To  Anyone  Then  I'm  Definitely  All  For  It  I  Got  The  Other  Side  Of  The  Question  Is  There  Part  Of  The  World  Where  Wrestling  Just  Never  Caught  On  And  The  WWE  Has  Tried  So  Hard  Seems 
[02:06:30]  Like  You  Guys  Are  Pretty  Big  Yeah  Man  We're  Pretty  Much  Everywhere  You  Know  We're  Huge  In  China  Everywhere  How's  China  China  Was  Amazing  It  Really  Was  I  Was  I  Mean  The  Country  Wrong  Dude  I  Do  Know  That  You  Ever  Fuck  You  Ever  Fuck  Bubba's  Wife  No  No  No  Is  China  Cool  Yeah

[02:07:30]  To  Chant  Knew  What  To  Say  So  I  Mean  That  Is  A  Huge  Market  That  Is  Hopefully  Going  To  Open  Up  For  Us  Potentially  Hundreds  Of  Millions  Of  Viewers  So  Our  Products  Doing  Real  Weather  I  Think  It 
[02:08:00]  Five  Five  By  God  Everyone  Does  Fifty  Five  We  Had  A  Ride  From  The  Airport  And  The  Airport  Ride  Was  Like  I  Think  Like  An  Hour  From  The  Airport  To  The  Hotel 
[02:08:30]  Up 
[02:09:00]  So 
[02:09:30]  It's 
[02:10:00]  Different  Philosophy  On  Things  You 
[02:10:30]  Point  October  As  Opposed  To  September  Or  November  Of  And  WWE  The  Big  Show  On  Twitter  If  You  You  Were  Six  Two  As 
[02:11:00]  A  Twelve  Year  Old  Yeah  Were  Your  Parents  Big  My  Dad  Was  Well  My  Mom  Was  Five  Ten  The  Milkman  Was  No  My  Dad  Was  About  Six  Four  Six  Five  My  Mom  Is  Five  Ten  Do  You  Have  Siblings  I  Have  A  Sister  Lives  In  Rensselaer  New  York  She's  The  Smart  One  In  The  Family  She's  Like  Really  Super  Smart  No  You seem  Pretty  Smart  No  I'm  A  Complete  Idiot  My  Dad  My  Dad  And  My  Sister  Are  Genius  Level  And  I'm  The  Guy  That  Got  Big  Hands  So 
[02:11:30]  That's  How  That  Works  Do  You  Have  To  Go  Out  When  You're  Like  A  Big  Dude  Do  You  Have  To  Go  Out  Of  Your  Way  To  Show  People  That  You're  Gentle  Guy  And  He  Never  Does  That  He  Doesn't  Get  Caught  A  Because  He  Knows  He  Could  Throw  A  Guy  Through  A  Window  So  He  Doesn't  Have  That  There's  A  Certain  Amount  Of  Calmness  That  Comes  With  That  I 
[02:12:00]  Just  So  Rude  And  It's  Canada  Canada  Is  Like  America's  Backpack  You  Know  What  I  Mean  It's  Like  You  Know  If  It  Wasn't  For  Us  You  Guys  Are  Speaking  Russian  Korean  Right  So  Chill 
[02:12:30]  On  The  Immigration  Stuff  In  Canada  Which  Means  Now  I'm  Pretty  I'm  Going  To  Get  Probed  The  Next  Time  I  But  This  One  Lady  Was  Just  So  What  Are  You  Doing  Here  What  Do  You  Think  I'm  Here  To  Wrestle  You  Know  And  She  Was  Just  Very  Very  Aggressive  I  Don't  Know  If  She  Dated  A  Wrestler  In  The  Past  And  He  Gave  Her  A  Dirty  Sanchez  Or  Something  Whatever  The  Problem  Was  She  Was  Super  Aggressive  I  Said  Man  Can  I  Just  Have  My  Passport  And 
[02:13:00]  She  Is  Like  No  You  You  Are  Going  To  Listen  To  What  I  Have  To  Say  And  I  I'm  Thinking  There's  Just  A  Little  Wooden  Table  Here  And  What  If  I  Wasn't  Right  In  The  Head  It  Would  Take  Two  Seconds  To  Pull  Across  The  Table  Break  Her  Spine  Hope  You  Didn't  Say  That  At  That  The  Last  Thing  In  Stuck  Somewhere  In  Northern  Canada  Shoveling  Polar  Bear  Crap  So  I  Want  To  Go  Back  To  The  Traveling  The  The  The  Beds  And  the planes how are you how do you deal with that as much as you have to help you fly first um 
[02:13:30]  sometimes when it's available but we flew business first coming back on the egyptian air which is  you know it's business class like every other airline but uh my show they have they all have  these cute cubicles now for business like you have your own little section it's modular and  it looks nice in magazines well it's it's too damn small my shoulders are wider than the cubby hole  oh so it's like you know my right shoulder is a little bad my left hip's a little bad so i can't  lay on my right side my left side my shoulders are too wide to lay down flat so i just have to sit in 
[02:14:00]  the chair like i'm really interested in playing angry birds for 11 hours wow there's nothing else  to do and it's not like he also he didn't fly back on sunday and he's been wrestling he was wrestling  last night yeah at 11 30 last night he was wrestling in jersey yeah it was uh it was yeah how many hours  it's only a couple hour flight though so yeah it's no big deal i mean i had three hours sleep  before we left didn't sleep at all on the plane oh had about two hours sleep sunday night because 
[02:14:30]  of jet lag but you couldn't sleep by the plane either like even sitting up right also i just said  earlier where i couldn't fit the seat thanks for keeping up no no no but i knew you couldn't fit  this i hope we don't have a problem see how impressive he is i mean for my sake  sometimes like when you're like patrice was a comedian buddy of ours he was like six two or six  three big guy big wide dude and he said you learn how to live being uncomfortable and like he can sleep  in plane seats it's just sitting up uncomfortable he's like you learn how to live a real pain like 
[02:15:00]  every year we do a a handshake tour um for the military uh during the holidays and uh like we  go to afghanistan we'll go to iraq and it's usually four or five of us last time i went it was vince  eve kelly kelly and myself we went to afghanistan and got to go to a lot of the fobs that don't get  to see uh entertainers or or and help bring a little bit of america to them it's my absolute  favorite most passionate trip is going to see in our troops i love our troops and 
[02:15:30]  love the commitment to excellence that they have and and this year i was really excited because we  were uh had the possibility of maybe going to an aircraft carrier wow although the united states  government vetoed me because i was too big to be on the aircraft carrier really because of the it's  eight floors from what i understand and the uh i guess the the ceilings and the bunks and the the  actual doors that i have to go through i'm just too big yeah you could have hung out i was like 
[02:16:00]  dude you could just put a cotton hanger i'm cool i'm just happy to be here man come on out so yeah  i got uh i got my dude and what about one more question the hotel beds how the fuck do you sleep  in hotels oh i do it's just king-sized bed you know i actually i don't take up much room usually  at home i've got a mastiff a pit bull a german shepherd a boxer all sitting in bed oh wow yeah  it's i don't get very much bed i have a wife that thinks she's you know ginormous who has to like 
[02:16:30]  sleep in the middle of the bed and take all the bed i i literally sleep on the edge of the bed and i got  one arm that hangs off the bed but doesn't she understand you're the big show no she should  understand you're the big show no when i come home i'm the guy that leaves dirty socks on the floor  that's it dump the cat box can you think of a worse house to break into with fucking a pit bull  little dogs make me uncomfortable i mean if i plop down the couch and said i'm one of my dogs i'm 
[02:17:00]  gonna get an ass full of teeth you know what i mean if i said i'm a little dog it might be like  that far side commercial i might be putting up you know please find my dog and it's stuck  wow i'm so glad we i'm so glad we didn't get off to the wrong foot that would have been so bad for  me that would have been awkward for you i don't have anything to prove i'm i'm i'm happy i'm excited  to be here i know but we should uh we should ask some wrestling questions go ahead fire away  i mean sam's the secret weapon sam i guess a million wrestling questions let's not be too niche 
[02:17:30]  though come on something that maybe all right so when you started started wcw you were a young guy  yes but you immediately went into a program with hulk hogan right what was the vibe in the locker  room like when when this young guy is coming in you know what and he gets the main event spot it was  a completely different era the the business wasn't full as many young guys as there are now back then  everybody was a seasoned veteran arn anderson rick flair um uh hogan savage uh jim duggan there were so 
[02:18:00]  many seasoned veterans that uh they saw a guy like me as uh potential for the industry um somebody that  could basically our business is about entertaining and selling tickets and somebody that could do that  so right away i became uh i think everybody's kid brother so i mean you know they looked after me and  they ribbed me a lot but they also um took care of me and and helped me to to come along i didn't find 
[02:18:30]  out really how competitive our business was till i came to wwe um wcw was kind of laid back for a while  there was a lot of guys that were already established already very secure in their career so they were  they were very amiable to to help in younger talent out i know when i came up to wwe um  holy crap what an education i mean you know they didn't give a crap who i was where i'd come from 
[02:19:00]  i had to earn respect all over again um it was uh a very rude lesson i remember  wrestling stone cold and rock in the garden and uh i came into the ring and you know i used to just  thing i threw my arm up the air and yelled like for the chokeslam and rock looks right at me goes  completely made fun of me in the garden and i'm looking at him like i looked right at him i said 
[02:19:30]  man that's all i got you know what i mean i didn't know how to do all the entertaining and have all the  personality that they had it was your one thing yeah and uh i learned a lot stone cold was probably uh  one of the best influences working with him in my career you know he's just uh  just an amazing uh amazing personality and amazing amazing talent in the ring he uh  i got stuck working with him um stuck i worked with him in europe for one of the tours in europe and 
[02:20:00]  he just beat the hell out of me every night and hit me with a stunner didn't tell me anything in the  ring didn't didn't help me along did nothing i was like jeez you know what is it with this guy  what's a stunner his finish okay and uh um some of the other guys are like hey look you got to take  over on steve you know you got to earn steve's respect and i said yeah but you know he's stone  cold you know he's kind of the golden goose of the company you know i don't want to thump the guy  you know what i mean you know so we're arguing back and forth and um we had a show in london a 
[02:20:30]  non-televised match and uh i was working stone cold and he rolled out of the ring um to the floor  and i got out beat him up a little bit threw him back in the ring but i i hiked his tights up his  butt so which apparently pissed steve off so when i got back in the ring he blasted me like three times  in the chin as hard as he could and goes off the tights you son of a bitch like that and it got me mad 
[02:21:00]  i grabbed him by the face and picked him up and carried him across the ring and stuck him in the  turnbuckle said who in the f you think you're hitting he goes there you go kid way to fire up  so you guys are all fucked up but it clicked in my head it was like yeah i don't need to tell  anybody when it's my turn to take over i take over whenever i want to so we're working a couple  weeks later and steve's really helping me a lot just with psychology and mentality and aggression 
[02:21:30]  in the ring and uh we're working one night and steve's real hard to hear in the ring you know  with his voice and he'll tell you that you know he hits me a couple times goes  takes off and hits the ropes i don't know what the hell he's doing i don't know where he's going  what he wants so i just held up a boot i figured he could run into the boot he could duck the boot  you know he could catch the boot there's a myriad of options he stops right in front of my boot and 
[02:22:00]  then jumps out of the ring the most unorthodox awkward made me look like a complete idiot  i'm staring in the ring with one foot in the air haven't hit anything and i'm like i look over the  top rope to the floor he's on the floor what in the hell was that you stupid son bitch and i'm like  okay great he's mad so he finished the match you get to the back he goes i'm trying to teach  you out there i'm i got tenure if you listen to me and do what i tell you you'll learn how to work 
[02:22:30]  that's what i'm here for damn it when i call spot you do a spot um what do you say at that time right  you don't say hey i didn't understand you mumbling bastard and say yes sir i'll try to make sure that  doesn't happen again what's a spot uh just uh what a sequence of events that happens in the ring  oh okay so where everyone knows it's yeah okay yeah yeah it's whatever i'm stooging off some  stuff here and i'll probably get in trouble no no we love this shit how old were you when you went to  the wwe uh 26 i've been three years i started 23 but it's just amazing to think because you know 
[02:23:00]  you guys were watching when you debuted wwe to think of the big show being too scared to like  put up his offense against stone cold yeah no no it's not that he's too scared he didn't say he's  scared the whole thing no the whole thing is with this i mean this is entertainment you know we're  with sports entertainment you know i mean and let's face it i'm big enough to cause a lot of very 
[02:23:30]  serious damage that's not what i'm about i'm about you know entertaining folks being my character  you know the big show on tv is nothing like i am in real life i mean it's a part of me you know i  mean sometimes i get looks on my face and my wife says oh i know that look you were mad i said no i  wasn't i said oh you were mad because i've seen that look you know so i mean yeah there's a certain  part of your your inner persona that comes out that becomes more part of your character i mean you  know stone cold is an aggressive you know ass-kicking son of a gun but people don't realize also that 
[02:24:00]  stone cold is a very intelligent brilliant guy you know i mean he's very quick-witted very  intelligent with marketing and merchandising and understands business you know um you look at  kane kane's got a degree in economics for crying out loud you know what i mean that's crazy to think  you know we did what we did weakest link you know and i think kane kane kicked butt on weakest link on  his so i mean uh there's a there's a different myriad of guys there's a lot of guys that have 
[02:24:30]  teaching degrees and and uh you know so uh i think one of our guys has a degree in um chemistry or  something like that one of the guys i think brodus clay has some kind of maybe marine biology degree  or something like that i mean you wouldn't expect it right of course so when when wcw comes to you  and says we're going to do a spot where hulk hogan's going to throw you off the roof of cobo hall  yeah are you like at that point young enough that you're just like okay whatever you guys say 
[02:25:00]  and you don't realize yeah yeah i'm excited yeah sure yeah they came to me now i'd be like  have you lost your damn mind because they did this thing where hulk hogan and and the big show the  giant at the time where they had a monster truck sumo match on the roof people don't realize it was  like minus 20 on the roof of that building it was so cold freezing hogan threw me off the wall  i took a nice plunge into a nice airbag but the announcers are going no no he threw me off the roof 
[02:25:30]  of cobo hall this is terrible  hello hilarious were you worried sam at the time at the time no even at the time he didn't give a  crap about me he was like i'm a hogan fan he was a bad guy you know thank god hulk hogan's person  you're a little hulcamaniac yeah but then the giant was able to  yeah i had the album too hulk hogan the wrestling boot band is he a nice guy hulk yeah yeah he is 
[02:26:00]  uh definitely uh was very instrumental in helping me out and get my break i got my breakthrough  danny bonaduce and hulk danny bonaduce danny bonaduce we were doing he was doing a morning drive  karaoke in chicago right do a karaoke and uh it was like american idol some people came in and sang and  were excellent some people came and sang and were garbage um but uh karaoke company that i was  working for was working with danny danny had a charity basketball game with hulk hogan jimmy hart 
[02:26:30]  and mr t and brought me in as his ringer to play with them and then i got to that's how it started  that's how it started for me wow i never did that hulk met me and says brother you got a dollar sign  you're for here i said well please show it to me because eyes broke that's how i got my break  how it started it was a different business back then you didn't have the you know like the fcw  tryout camps and training camps and uh and the all the avenues they have now for young athletes to  pursue a career in this i mean back then it was very hard to get in you had to know somebody that 
[02:27:00]  knew somebody that knew somebody again what year was that that you went in oh i met hogan in 94  started 95 so wow that's a hell of a jump up in your life yeah karaoke to wrestling karaoke to  wrestling yeah i uh i remember uh um the the first contract that i got i was like oh my god  after about six months in the business i went man they are screwing 
[02:27:30]  anything else that's amazing i mean we could talk about wrestling for hours i don't know if you want  to i don't care you know thanks sam wow that was like you're giving me the boot appreciate it  oh man yeah this is kind of humiliating for everybody sam why would you do that he's a  great guest you're just leaving him there with his boot up in the air yeah exactly what the hell  was that when did you when did you get to that point where you were comfortable that you could be  like a a ring general is what they call it that that you weren't you know what i mean um i would say 
[02:28:00]  probably probably after about five or six years in seven years in um we acknowledge that was a bad  question i don't think no it's actually it's actually a good question some guys some guys get  it really early i mean uh my favorite thing is when i watch the third generation guys guys like ted  dibiase randy orton um um joe mcgillicuddy who's kurt henning's son um who's ax henning's grandson i 
[02:28:30]  mean you see these guys alberto del rio's third generation you see some of these guys that have  grown up in this industry uh you know rock same thing um these guys that have grown up in this  industry they're it's so ingrained in their in their blood um they make decisions and great decisions  um so naturally and so much easier uh that's a good question sam sorry yeah no it is a good 
[02:29:00]  question i mean you know it's different for every guy some guys some guys don't ever get that yeah  that ability to understand uh themselves understand what the crowd needs and understand their opponent  and tell the story at the same time it's a um it's a unique gift and some guys are brilliant at it  you know you look at triple eight sean michaels undertaker the reason those guys are so good is  because you know they are that good they're that good at understanding what's going on in the ring  you know and i think that's uh something that uh anybody that does this business that really loves 
[02:29:30]  it should should strive for that right you know i got one more i think it's a good one  sure it better be we'll be the judge of that i think it's gonna be a good one yeah uh you're  promoting wwe 13 i said that already yeah but that's not that's not good he's stealing what i said  it's been a little while you guys gonna fight fight fight  stokehold did a thing a video with cm punk right right promoting the game and uh he whether he was 
[02:30:00]  working or not said uh that the roster now is not hungry like the roster was then that there's a thing  with the young guys now that they're happy to be on tv but they're not fighting to be in the top  spot like they were back when you know you and stone cold the rock and i think it's uh a different  uh a different environment i think uh back in that era there were so many seasoned veterans  that the competition level was so high to excel and perform i think what you got now is basically a 
[02:30:30]  little bit changing the guard i mean there's a little bit of vacuum of experienced um seasoned  veterans you've got a lot of new talent a lot of young talents developing um i think that may be  the impression that every older talent may have that locker room's not hungry um i would say for  our young guys i think they are hungry i think they're just uh uh a different kind of hungry you  know when i started it was like rock and roll you know i mean a to z everything and i think now these 
[02:31:00]  kids are multimedia oriented brand oriented um uh there's just they're just they've got more of a  business approach to things but i think they're all hungry i think in time as all the younger guys  experience value grows i think the the competition and the hungerness is hungerness is that a word  hunger hunger hunger hunger yes yeah pocket who do i like yeah right young guys that you like  young guys that i like uh definitely uh i like uh wade barrett um dolph ziggler um 
[02:31:30]  i like ted dibiase he's been struggling with some injuries but he's he's got flavor you know i mean  he's got all the tools tall athletic good looking third generation um has a lot of talent for that  um some of our guys are doing well even uh even sheamus i mean my opponent for this weekend  hell in the cell samus is is as a younger guy but he's really excelled and and and done well for 
[02:32:00]  himself it's gonna be great for me to knock him out at hell in the cell but you know and crush his  dreams but uh he's another one that's uh been very hungry and done very well um there's a lot of new  guys coming up there's a lot of guys that are they're just trying to find their way right now  and uh i think maybe it might be a little bit unfair uh judgment say they're not hungry enough  you know um you know it was a long time this business before steve really hit became stone 
[02:32:30]  cold steve austin too yeah it was i mean you know he was stunning steve story yeah yeah that whole  thing and then when he finally had when it finally flipped for steve he found his niche and i think  that that's the thing for some of these young guys is finding out who they are and and finding out um  the best way to maximize their potential but i think a lot of those guys that we have in our locker  now all have the potential else they wouldn't be there it's just whether or not they absorb it fast  enough and and uh step up to the top so we'll see you know this business has a way of weeding out 
[02:33:00]  those that don't belong there anyway you know just for the demands of travel and uh the constant  demands of excellence every night to perform and deliver every night sick tired hurt um i don't  know how you guys do it i really don't know it takes a certain amount of crazy it really does i mean  you know it's you know i'll have injuries and limp through the airport like i'm 75 years old but  you know as soon as i go through that curtain the adrenaline kicks sure i don't care i don't care  how much i hurt during the day as long as that 15 or 20 minutes i've got enough hot packs and 
[02:33:30]  stretching on me before the match that i'm ready to go we've we've heard all the stories over the  years you guys sharing freaking cars and hotel rooms and all that shit sleeping on the floor to save  yeah mc fully used to do that well that was just to save five dollars level well he's he's he's a  good friend of ours he comes in here a lot and we know he's a cheapo his stories crack us up well  he'll sleep at uh at the houses of the fans just to save a few bucks yeah yeah he's told a million  of these stories yeah yeah i remember mc came to me one time he says hey i got a fight right in the

[02:37:30]  very very cool liked him a lot uh peter chris is going to be here in a few minutes yes jimmy's  getting ready for his big interview with peter chris he wrote this uh book there makeup to break up  and uh holy fuck it's crazy i was cracking up reading some of the good for some of us here's  what i was doing yeah because i'm not a i'm not a big uh what they call reader i know people you're  freaking out you say like what but um yeah not a big reader but i would crack the book open and the 
[02:38:00]  second i saw the name gene i just started reading and it's fucking hilarious it doesn't matter where  you open it up it's gene smells bad and he's fucking whores he's fucking women that are like  old lady uh uh the limo driver was an old lady and he fucked her she was what 60 yeah pigs that are  like in the room where where peter would go into the the room and gene would be fucking someone and  he said he just smells sex in the room and and uh uh gene wouldn't shower so he just stunk 
[02:38:30]  every time every time i crack this book open and just see the name gene yeah i i read it and it's  hilarious he told one story about how gene and paul way back in the early days were they would share mics  during rehearsal and they would do it on stage and he said one time paul was like what the fuck did  you eat and gene smiled and he still had menstrual blood on his teeth he said gene will fuck and eat  any pussy he said he fuck anything that kind of made me respect gene though like the fact that he could 
[02:39:00]  eat bloody pussy and then just not brush his teeth i'm like that guy's an animal there's there's a beauty  to that uh beauty there's so much uh i can't i was just talking to spencer outside one of our bookers  and he said it's you see this book is it's fucking amazing it's the and i'm not overselling it because  i love peter chris i'm really not it's it's the most revealing i think we believe you at this point 
[02:39:30]  i know but it's like i know i i fucking whore for guys i love but this is fantastic brutal it's brutal  and we got the explanation of uh beth that i want to play for peter chris today oh good because gene  uh took a bit of credit for the whole thing even though it was uh peter chris's song for the most  part um we got axl rose singing bad and we got jingles want to squeeze in some axl rose yeah you  could play a game called how how long how much of this can you actually sit through really yeah fucking 
[02:40:00]  guns and roses man that was one of my big bands for a while it's horrible to see what has happened  because it was just it was powerhouse shit because he's not even 50 we were discussing  before the show i i think it's around 50 late late 40s and he's already completely done you got  mick jagger and the stones fucking they're doing it at 70 and still sounding great and and this axl rose  couldn't figure it out yeah james is james hetfield of metallica is only a less than a year younger  than axl axl's gonna be it's a pretty big difference in front man axl will be 50 in august august 30 
[02:40:30]  no that's james yeah that this is james axl is 50 oh yeah wow okay but they're about the same age  and we see uh two different things going on pretty pretty big so danny brought this to the show where  where did this happen uh i gotta travis you know it offhand is it neil young's bridge school benefit  that he does every year so is neil singing with him no he should have been neil tends to do that  not this time though huh no all right and uh this is axl uh this is guns and roses well well 
[02:41:00]  slash and uh this is an acoustic performance so of uh so it should be easier to sing acoustic welcome  to the jungle yeah that doesn't even sound right you know some songs should not be acoustic you're  bridge bridge school is is stripped down like anybody who plays that is playing you know an acoustic  should we start the timer 
[02:41:30]  it's gonna get a lot better when when axl comes out yeah  no that was not him sure it was he yeehawed wait one of you guys just you just sounded better than  axl did wait one of you guys just did that right no no rewind it he just did a yeehaw he's having fun 
[02:42:00]  so far so good 
[02:42:30]  can i tell you something before we continue if you didn't tell me and i wish you did it  i would have sworn this was east side day fucking around  i would have sworn i wish you didn't tell me this was fucking guns and roses  wasn't getting headlines today i had to i had to am i perfect yes dude i sat there with this video  and i'm like is this real because like for a second i was like uh it's not it's not 
[02:43:00]  someone just dumped over it yeah i was like is someone pulling a gag on everyone but no  i was like dave's dream he could sing this better than axl now  you got the money honey we do it please  we're gonna jump to watch and bring you to  i'm depressed 
[02:43:30]  he also sounds like he's very out of press yeah yeah he's having a tough time it's all the i mean  look it's no big secret he's got a lot of extra weight on him these days he's nowhere near the  little thing that's so depressing  they never should have agreed to do this because it's so stripped down that it just shows you like 
[02:44:00]  what an artist can really do you know my pal eric who i was living with in rochester a house of  a bunch of us and uh i remember getting the guns and roses album when not not many of us really knew  who they were yet and now it's now it's this that's it now it's this that's what we're getting now  wow this just sounds like a bad cover band 
[02:44:30]  oh what's he doing  oh  sure it does 
[02:45:00]  it's not even good enough for x factor or american idol 
[02:45:30]  remember this guy oh  that guy ruled  that guy ruled but now he's this guy  oh shit  what happened  oh no it looks like he's wearing a fez too so that just kind of adds to it  hey  we got dave singing uh welcome to the jungle probably better oh come on it's not welcome to the jungle but  it is yeah dead on axle all right listen here we go  i get up around seven get up and around nine i don't worry about nothing no cause words are wasting my fucking time 
[02:46:00]  i don't worry about nothing no cause it's not like that's what i'm gonna do  yeah  And now let's go to the real Axel. 
[02:46:30]  He's like Dan Kamee and Dresden Roses now.  He's putting more heart into it anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, what happened there?  I thought he did that part pretty good.  It didn't sound very powerful.  The band sounds like shit.  Really bad.  It sounds like shit.  I mean, look, Axel doesn't sound great, but the band sounds like shit. 
[02:47:30]  Well, why would you try?  It's all mish-moshed.  It's not a tight band.  Knowing your lead guy stinks.  All right, I learned.  Not a tight band.  I knew they wouldn't make it through the whole thing.  No.  That's just depressing.  It really is.  I was a huge G&R fan.  And what it's become, it's just sad.  Yeah.  You didn't like it?  Ah.  Jesus.  Should we take a break before Peter goes?  Yeah, just to be ready.  Oh.  Jim is in freak-out mode.  But I'm happy.  No, no.  I know you're happy.  You wrote a book. 
[02:48:00]  There's a book.  Something got out of a book.  You wrote a book.  You wrote a book.  You wrote a book.  You wrote a cat man.  Cat with whiskers.  Drums.  You played a drum.  Signing.  Book.  Kiss.  Band was kiss.  Gene.  Blood.  Spit.  No good.  Money.  Your turn.  You've met him before, right?  I've met him twice for photos, but I've never spoken to him for any length of time.  Oh, I can't wait.  Too bad.  We had some jingles today.  We might have to do that tomorrow, huh?  It's fine.  We had plenty of jingles.  Talking about Apes Freely and how he would always have, like, fucking KY jelly and rubber  gloves.  One night, I actually heard them from all the way down the hall. 
[02:48:30]  His current girlfriend loved anal sex, and I heard her screaming like a banshee, fuck  me like a truck driver, fuck me like a truck driver, as he banged her in the ass.  How fucking great is that?  Every page is a gem.  It's a doozy.  It really is.  Every fucking page is a gem.  Very cool.  Peter Criss next.  Stay there.  Beth, I hear you calling, but I can't come home right now, because me and the boys are 
[02:49:00]  doing some radio, and I can't find the sound.  Thank you.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  Coming up this week on At The Movies with Norton  and Boss, the guys review the latest Liam Neeson thriller, Taken 2.  It was awful.  It was great.  It stunk.  It was fucking great. 
[02:49:30]  Terrible story.  Terrible story.  I loved it.  It was predictable garbage.  Don't fucking, don't be scared of him.  You loved it.  It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big, dad, stepdad, have pony.  And then at the end, he brings the fucking big singer.  I saved her life.  It was fucking horrendous.  It was good action, though.  I mean, it was good.  The action was good.  Yes.  But so what?  That's all coming up on the next At The Movies with Norton and Boss. 
[02:50:00]  Sirius XM.  The O.B.  and Anthony Show.  James P. Norton ready for the big interview with Peter Criss from KISS, of course.  Sal did a good job with his prep sheet.  I see it.  He was officially in KISS from 73 to 80.  I wasn't sure about that.  I thought it was Bloys or Colt.  And then he mentioned the other.  Not one thing from the book in this whole prep sheet. 
[02:50:30]  Jesus.  Could have even read a synopsis about the book.  He could have worked.  Yes, Dr. R.  Okay.  Sal doesn't have a copy of the book to go through.  He could have put on Amazon and fucking.  Yeah.  Stop defending him.  He's fired.  You're right.  She plays a jingles.  Can't really star anything else.  He'll be up in a minute, you said?  He's on his way.  All right.  No worries.  We have some jingles.  The jingles, they're still coming in strong?  Yeah.  I got about 70 a night. 
[02:51:00]  Nice.  We'll play a lot of jingles tomorrow.  And I think we go back to Jacktober tomorrow, too, right?  We'll have to take it a couple days off now.  Supposedly, Sam's working on a special Jacktober for tomorrow.  I don't know what that means.  He said he needed a few extra days to get it together.  That's crazy.  This better be really good, then.  Oh, I know what it is.  Oh, you do?  Is it thumbs up?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, I know who it is, then.  No, you don't.  No.  John and Jeff?  No.  No.  No.  I guarantee you don't know who it is.  Is it a new person being featured on Jacktober? 
[02:51:30]  It's us.  Yeah.  For tomorrow?  You know we have to end with us, right?  We do that every year.  Yeah.  You rock sound case.  We look at ourselves in the end.  Yeah.  We turn the microphones on ourselves.  I might...  I think I found my college radio tapes.  What are you doing?  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  Plug the camera in.  Okay.  He fucking starts it halfway through the interview. 
[02:52:00]  What are you doing?  You're standing here yapping with the camera closed.  Plug it in.  You know how many good fucking...  I finally got that.  I'm like, we'll try to get Peter when he comes in.  You know how many times I fucking have these interviews just in the middle?  So, until Thursday.  And then the guy's talking.  I'm like, what are you doing for?  Turn it on.  Stop trying to save batteries, you fucking OCD chiseler.  Plug it in.  Please.  Plug it in.  Anyway, I was saying I might have found my college radio tapes.  I might have to bring one of those in.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, from like 1991 or something like that.  It's not on.  It's not on.  I'm not recording yet.  But he's going to come in.  You're not going to see him.  Watch out.  Yeah, what are you doing?  We're doing radio.  I know we're doing radio, but it's fucking face this way.  He's coming up.  Is that plugged in so it doesn't run out of batteries?  I'm going to go get it.  I'm going to turn it on yet.  Turn the fucking thing on and have someone bring a battery.  Okay.  How hard is this?  Why is there only one person that works for the show?  I don't know.  Everyone takes turns being the one person that works for the show around here. 
[02:53:00]  Someone get a fucking plug.  Go get the plug, Travis.  I don't mean to be fucking Tim Technical, but somebody plug it in.  I don't think you're being Tim Technical if all you want is the camera on.  Yeah, I put the camera on.  I don't think you're all right with that one.  I don't need a six camera shoot.  I just want the one video camera on.  Did you guys discuss the Shaq poster yesterday?  How did that turn out for you?  Great.  Because we went through the whole thing on Friday, what E-Rock had to do to make sure everything was done properly.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock was a fucking champ.  How's the fold in the poster?  It's okay?  What fold? 
[02:53:30]  Supposedly it was a little fold.  I'm not even trying to be a dick.  No, I didn't see it.  Supposedly it was a slight fold because he put his arm on the poster himself.  Oh, Shaq did?  Right, E-Rock?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, when he went to science, he leaned down on it.  That can't be helpful.  If Shaquille did it, what are you going to do?  Well, E-Rock said he did it, but he told me that he's going to tell you that Shaq did it.  E-Rock probably tripped and his knee went into it.  He heard someone said something was bogus, and he thought they said hoagies, and he was running.  Fucking tripped, and his knee was in hoagie mode. 
[02:54:00]  No, I'm sorry, E-Rock.  You did a good thing for me.  Hoagie mode.  Another giant thing that you can't display in your house.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Here's Peter Criss.  Is it on?  Oh, that's a lady.  Wait, is that...  No, he's coming.  Oh.  Here he is.  There's Peter Criss.  Holy fuck.  Is that on?  Yeah.  Where's the plug?  Ain't no plug.  Yeah, let's get it plugged in.  All right.  Peter Criss.  Peter, take a seat.  Good to see you.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Danny.  Good to see you.  Hi, Peter.  How are you?  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  We've been reading excerpts from the book all morning, laughing our asses off. 
[02:54:30]  Well, that's good, then.  What a great book.  I think it's good.  That's a good thing.  Yeah.  What a great book.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  A lot of heart into it.  I could tell.  A lot of liver, a lot of heart, a lot of everything.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, there are a lot of books out there that people like to think, tell all.  I hate to be cliche, but wow.  You certainly do go all out.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I started it in 87, put it aside, and it's a miracle.  Should I put these on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Can I be right on?  Yeah.  I love it.  There you go.  Yeah, this was a labor of love, trust me.  I started this way back in 87 and put it aside, and I think God had his reasons for this,  because there would be no reunion in there.  I wouldn't be getting back.  I wouldn't be about my breast cancer, and I'm five years free.  All right.  I just got a huge award for being the first male to really bring it forth on the table that men get it.  And who thinks, you know, we think we're going to get heart attacks, prostate cancer. 
[02:55:30]  I never thought.  I came home from the gym one day, and I felt a nodule, and my wife, thank God, saved my life.  And we, one thing led into another, and it was breast cancer.  And I removed it, and I'm five years breast cancer free.  And now I push the word a lot.  And I just did a walk Sunday for 20,000 people showed up.  Last year it was 17,000, and what was great, the signs.  Was that all the people with the pink on?  No, we had blue this year.  My neighborhood, it was all pink. 
[02:56:00]  Well, pretty much so, but we're changing it to blue, and this was more blue.  And the signs actually said men get breast cancer too.  So it was pretty cool to see that.  You know, it's nice.  I have a lot of accolades.  It's nice to win gold and platinum records.  But to me, this is a much bigger thing in my life.  It's changed my whole life immensely to tell guys, which we don't think, because we're idiots, that we could get anything, you know.  And did you get the wrong diagnosis at first?  Didn't they misdiagnose you? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  One doctor did in New Jersey, and then my doctor, Alex Switzel, in Cornell, rechecked it.  And sure enough, he gave me one of those calls, these standing, sitting calls.  And you know, when you get these calls, they're not good.  And I said, well, give me the bad news.  He said, you have breast cancer.  And I said, you've got to be kidding me.  And he said, but the good news is you caught it, and I wish some men would do this, come in right away when they find something, because you won't have to get chemo.  You won't have to go through all that stuff that we, the terrible stuff people go through. 
[02:57:00]  And I think maybe if I went through that, I might not have been so brave as to say, hey, man, I had breast cancer, and I'd beat it.  Maybe if I went through all that horror.  But I didn't, and I think it was God's way, because I'm a major Catholic kid, that his way is saying go out there and tell men that they could get breast cancer.  And none of you guys, I'm sure, would ever want even to go down that road.  It's a terrible disease.  And I meet women who have had it, and they didn't even educate their own husbands or sons. 
[02:57:30]  They're kind of clueless.  We are.  We're all clueless.  Can I ask you, is it rare?  Yes, it's 1%.  How much?  1%.  But still, it could be your dad, your brother.  That's a lot if it's somebody that you know, and everybody knows somebody with cancer.  The only reason I ask that is because we've never really heard of men getting breast cancer.  Bubba Smith, there's very few public figures, guys that you know who've had it.  That's the only reason I'm asking.  No, right.  And because...  Well, 1% is too much, obviously, and you should take care of yourself. 
[02:58:00]  I think so, since I was one of the percent.  Right, right, right.  You know, and I think now that I'm out there kind of spreading the word, hopefully, you know,  a guy will go in.  I did a recent sign-in.  A kid came up to me, and I say kid, and he got it at 17, and he was 20, and he's three  years with it.  And I couldn't believe a 17-year-old kid could get breast cancer.  Right.  And it blew my mind.  I really, you know, I had to hold myself in to not break down because he felt alienated, 
[02:58:30]  and there is such a stigma on pink, and pink's great, you know, but we have to, I'm trying  at least, and I'm only one voice, is to try to get guys hip to this.  I asked, and just to explain, like, I live in Manhattan, and they had the walk on Saturday  or Sunday, and it was all pink, and it was all women.  That's why I brought that up.  You don't see the men marching for breast cancer.  One thing you said about that, too, which made me happy, was you said that the feeling 
[02:59:00]  in your nipple came back, and I'm big on nipple play, so I was really happy.  That was a tremendous relief that the nipple feeling comes back.  Yeah, you're funny.  Here's what I did.  I actually used that because some guys, they really don't get it.  And so when couples would come up to me, I had to, I figured, let me get around this,  and what could I say?  So I was, let your lady check you.  You could check her.  This could lead into lots of good things.  Right, right, right.  Now, us being men, immediately, we think, oh, great, boobs. 
[02:59:30]  And so, you know, they all got it, but it was kind of, I thought, a kind of sick way to  get it across, that men get it.  But by the immediate sex touching, oh, I'm all for that, you know, that's a good thing.  Yeah, until she wants to start checking prostate.  Or other places.  Yeah.  Hey, you, I read the book, and I got to say, honestly, like, from what you're talking about  even now with the cancer and everything that led up to it, it's, honestly, it's the most 
[03:00:00]  brutally honest rock biography I've ever read, autobiography.  Yes, the other cancer in the book, Gene Simmons, let's talk about, you guys, it never changes.  Well, we've, well, we've had our history with Gene all the years.  I was excited today that I was going to be here with you guys, you guys are great.  We've had our history with Gene.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It is.  So have I.  He's an interesting fellow.  Yeah, yeah.  We were reading quotes from the book, because you say things that people don't say in books, 
[03:00:30]  and it was so nice to read somebody being brutally honest, like this particular quote,  which I read one earlier.  This is a different one.  It's just about how you felt on the reunion tour.  It was so irritating to hear Gene say, you're working for me now, and you'll do as I say,  or you'll be fired, just like any other employee.  I wanted to cut his throat from ear to ear.  If he said that to me back in the day, I would have taken a bottle and smashed it across  his forehead.  You think I'm from Brooklyn? 
[03:01:00]  Oh, my God, that's hilarious.  But who knew that of all the members of KISS, you were the one that would pick up a bat?  Like, I was amazed to read your earlier history before the band.  What a fucking tough...  Did you see me on Oz with a bat?  No, I actually didn't see that.  I want to watch it on YouTube after I read the book.  We used to have a thing, you know, that the four of us could say what we want to say about  each other brutally.  No one else could.  And I felt I had the total right to be brutally about this. 
[03:01:30]  And I was not any easier on myself than I was on anybody else that I wrote about.  I was just as brutal about what I would go through or what I did in my antics.  Because I'm an honest guy.  I believe we all put our pants on the same.  We all feel the same.  I grew up in an Irish Catholic family in four rooms.  I did not grow up rich.  I grew up in a really poor neighborhood.  Making guns was fun.  I made a lot of extra money doing that.  Nobody knows half of my life.  And I'm finding people are more excited about the beginning of my life of Brooklyn and growing 
[03:02:00]  up in gangs and getting to it than the kiss years.  And that makes me happy because I really wanted to get that across of my life more than a typical  kiss book.  Yeah, of course, I started the band.  And yes, it was a great time of my life.  But my childhood was a great time.  But Catholic school was an amazing, amazing thing for me.  I hated it.  But that's how it was then.  And it was really a brutal, a brutal education.  So I wanted, I didn't want to go to school. 
[03:02:30]  I wanted to just play my drums all day.  You opened the book.  And this was amazing.  You opened the book talking, it was 94.  And you're in the earthquake in California.  Northridge.  And can you describe what was kind of happening at that moment?  Because it was a very depressing opening.  And you also talk about having a large sum of money on the wall behind a picture, which  I thought was...  Gone in Amour.  Oh, it was all, okay.  What exactly was happening there?  You know, it's funny.  A lot of rock stars probably won't admit it.  I was down to $100,000 to my name from, I'm talking a lot of money. 
[03:03:00]  $10,000 to $1 million.  Easily $20,000 something.  Wow.  And I was, went through a divorce.  I owed the IRS all of a sudden $3 million that came out of nowhere from a 70-something  thing that we invested.  We put money in a coal shelter.  Later on, it came back from all, and it was only $400,000 then.  But later on, it came back to $3 million with penalties or else to keep it.  Oh, my God.  So there's another problem I got. 
[03:03:30]  My family now, I don't have my daughter anymore with me, as I had every day of my life.  My wife marries my attorney, you know.  Oh, right.  How bad can it...  It sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it?  Yeah.  I couldn't make this up for you.  I couldn't come up with this stuff.  And so I fought also the Star Magazine, if you guys remember.  I went to the tabloid stuff.  Some guy sleeping in the toilets of Santa Monica.  I don't think so.  But it was...  What happened?  He said he was you. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  And it was right after my mother died.  So I was going through really hell.  My mother just passed it on.  We were extremely close.  And the earthquake came, and I was...  The day after the earthquake, I went to see my doctor, and I got carjacked.  And some guy...  I mean, it just didn't end.  Broke my face, the side of my face with brass knuckles.  I know I was in some section of L.A.  Everything was chaotic from the earthquake.  Black guy came around my car, punches me in the face, wanted the car, couldn't open up the safety belt, and tilted. 
[03:04:30]  I have six screws in my face holding up my whole bone here and the whole side of my cheek.  And I didn't even...  I wasn't aware of how I drove home.  I don't know.  And you had a pistol at that time.  I had a lot of pistols.  And I woke up, went back, saw him, then finally got back home.  And I...  When I came back to my home, it was shamble. 
[03:05:00]  It was just...  My albums were broken, whatever I had left of them.  My crystal, whatever I had of that from the marriage was broken.  The toilets blew up.  There was water.  There was dirt everywhere.  Nothing was working.  My clothes collapsed.  And I felt...  That's how my life, I felt, was.  There was just nothing left for me.  And I took out my .357 Magnum, and I put it in my mouth, and I thought I'd check out.  And at that moment, I looked over, and I saw a picture of my daughter on top of a dresser, 
[03:05:30]  which was the only thing still standing.  And there was a light on it, and I believe it was God's way of telling me,  you've got to be an idiot to do this.  And I didn't.  And I thought that would be a great way to open up the book at my lowest point of my life.  I felt that would be a great way to open it, because then you go on the journey of how I survived through all that.  And it was really scary.  And I was amazed you didn't, too.  You had a pistol in the car, and the guy hits you. 
[03:06:00]  And in the book, you go through this thought process of the life.  Which is amazing for me, because usually I would have just put one in him.  And I had a right to, because when I told the police, they said,  Jesus, we would have loved to see you shoot him if you could have found him.  But I didn't, yeah.  And for some reason, I got a clarity came over me that this is all you need,  is to now go out of this car and go up to this guy and shoot him.  And now you've got that problem, beside everything else you've got in your life. 
[03:06:30]  And I didn't.  And I believe it was God's way of talking to me.  I'm a very heavy Catholic kid.  I do believe in God.  I believe in miracles, because I've had, I don't know how many cat lives I have left, maybe four.  But I've been close to death a few times, quite a few times.  And I become now much more, I guess you do become more religious, maybe, when the Grim Reaper's at your door.  And to my cancer battle, and every day above ground, my dad used to say, is a good day.  And I look at life now as every day is really a blessing to be where I am in my life. 
[03:07:00]  So you almost got carjacked.  You had your last $100,000 in the trunk.  That's it, man.  I had it on the back of the ammo on the sock or a box hidden.  I grabbed it, because that's all I had.  I took my gun, put it in my sweatpants, and put a robe on and ran out in the street.  And it looked like the end of the world.  The streets were opening.  Johnny pumps were blowing through the air.  People were screaming.  It was like a movie, man.  It was like 9-11 again. 
[03:07:30]  It was like looking at that.  It was so surreal.  It was unbelievable.  We don't have earthquake guys.  We're New Yorkers.  We don't see that.  You see it on television.  But when you're in one, it's really spooky.  How far into Kiss 2 did you start to?  Because, again, I grew up with so many people on Kiss.  And you had no idea this stuff was going on internally as a fan.  How far into this process did you start to realize, like, this is going to be a fight? 
[03:08:00]  Or there's going to be problems with a couple of the other members?  Three, four years.  Yeah.  I could start feeling the wanting.  The power started coming.  The more we were going up the ladder of fortune and fame, the more it was kind of swaying to Mr. Simmons and Stanley.  Obviously, Ace and I were kind of not getting our musical songs in.  It's funny.  I wrote the biggest hit in the damn band.  And meanwhile, you know, I was kind of always getting put down for this stuff. 
[03:08:30]  So it was a battle.  It was always a battle.  And eventually, I didn't get the great education maybe the other two guys got.  So they would start playing mind games.  I don't like games.  I like genuine guys.  I like real people that tell me like it is no matter how much it hurts.  And I don't like to be messed with.  And they would constantly batter.  They called it battering, if you read Gene's book, battering my brain.  And let me tell you, it takes its toll.  I feel today I'm still a casualty of rock and roll wars because it turns that every day was a battle for one thing or another, 
[03:09:00]  for some kind of running the band or being the guy at the head of the band.  And eventually, they got their way, and I was miserable with it.  And you guys start out as good friends, right?  I thought so.  I thought we were pretty much brothers in arms.  I thought we all wanted the same thing.  We all wanted to do the same thing.  We all wanted the same road of success.  But that changed immensely.  And I realized even when I met them, they had a deal with some band, and they dumped the band because it wasn't their way. 
[03:09:30]  That should have gave me an immediate, you know, lights on.  And that's the same thing started happening as we would roll along.  And now they got their way.  And didn't, like, you and Ace were more, like, kind of like the fucking hardcore rock guys.  And they were more kind of going into the more cartoonish stuff.  Or, like, you know, I know you talked about Kiss Meets the Phantom, which, you know, apparently you're not a huge fan of that process. 
[03:10:00]  Did you hear?  You read I was drunk pretty much.  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't believe we got to that point where now we're wrestling with Frankenstein and the Wolfman.  You know, we're a rock band.  First, we're singing about looking for chicks and how great, you know, rock is.  And every parent hated us.  And we were going, that's the right track.  That's great rock and roll.  And next thing we're in a movie with Bela Lugosi and Frankenstein. 
[03:10:30]  And I hated it.  I hated it.  This is not the idea for me of where we were going.  And it was going Vegas.  It was going more and more.  We were turning to a Vegas act.  I wanted out.  I was an ace.  You know, he and I, I would have done anything for him.  I stuck up for him through all the years.  I was in his corner.  Gene used to tell him, you know, the best friend you got in this band is Peter Criss.  He'll always be there for you.  And it broke my heart when he broke my heart in the book I mentioned. 
[03:11:00]  And I won't tell the story.  But towards the reunion, towards the end, I was devastated, man.  I couldn't believe what went on.  And it was, again, about the old M-O-N-E-Y.  The money, money, money, power, power, power.  It was like it never was enough for those guys.  And I'm a rock and roller, man.  And I picked up drums because I wanted to just play music and someday maybe get a little  Gold 45 and a little picket fence house and take care of my mom and dad. 
[03:11:30]  That's all I ever wanted.  After the garden that was my dream was to play there for my parents, everything was cream.  You know, everything was good.  I didn't know the addiction problems.  It was the 60s and 70s.  You go to your manager, he had stuff.  You go to the record company, they had drugs.  You would get coke from all these guys?  Yeah, everybody.  My lawyers, my business people, I couldn't find a straight guy to tell them, you know,  I'm miserable.  I'm going through hell.  This is turning on me.  I'm not enjoying this anymore.  Does it make you question your legal representation when they have coke? 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's not a good sign of a lawyer who's a fucking better coke than a manager.  You know what I'm saying?  Or your manager and everybody else.  You know, you're sitting there.  Or your business guys.  I always think these guys had suits.  They went to college.  They're well-educated.  I must be in good hands.  I'm okay.  They were all drunk.  And they were all stewing blow and drinking scotch at all our board meetings.  And we were drawing cartoons like idiots.  And the money was going right out the door. 
[03:12:30]  And we weren't even paying attention.  Can you say what Paul would draw?  Because I was pretty amazed at that.  Everybody would do little sketches.  Oh, I could have said that.  You could read that.  That's pretty heavy.  Oh.  I think.  You should tell.  I don't want to give it away.  No, come on.  I don't want to do that.  All right.  Let's just say.  You do that.  You could do it.  All right.  Let's just say.  Apparently, Paul would sketch certain anatomical parts really accurately. 
[03:13:00]  Oh.  And really well.  All right.  And how often.  Let's just say.  How often.  Was this like a once in a while thing?  These sketches?  No.  These were all the time sketches.  You know.  And of course, I wanted to get out and party and get out of the meeting.  We were kids.  We wanted to sit around with a bunch of guys with suits talking about investing in this.  And investing in that.  The only thing we wanted to invest in was girls.  Rock and roll.  And have a great time.  And you don't have to worry about blowing any stories. 
[03:13:30]  Every page has a fucking home run on it.  There's nothing you're going to say here that's going to make people go, well, I know the whole story.  Believe me.  There's nothing you're going to do to blow.  This fucking book is so revealing.  And it's the honesty behind the emotion.  Thank you so much.  You don't dance around being very angry at these guys for fucking you.  There's anger.  No, I'm still angry.  I'm working on that.  I'm working on Forgive to Live.  I'm working on the anger.  I feel, again, still a casualty of rock and roll. 
[03:14:00]  And yeah, there's anger.  But, you know, if you read it, I'm as hard on me and as brutal on me as I would be on you if you were in the band.  I didn't give myself any breaks.  I talk of my cocaine addiction, how it made me a madman, how I went absolutely out of my mind.  I talk about John Belushi and I's friendship, how it broke my heart, what went on with John.  I talk about I don't give myself any room if I'm not going to give you room.  I'm a Brooklyn kid. 
[03:14:30]  I grew up, I think the truth, sometimes people would rather hear a lie than hear the truth.  And I was not going to play around with this.  I said, if I'm going to do this and people like yourself, they're going to read it, I'm not going to get caught in a lie or fabricate how many women.  I'm going to tell you the truth so I can live with myself and look in the mirror in the morning.  You know what my favorite truth in the book was?  And this was something I had always suspected.  That Ace has a giant cock.  That, I always knew.  He's German, you know.  No, because his hands bend.  He can't even play the guitar with his fucking giant hands. 
[03:15:00]  I'm like, he's all cock.  He has to be.  And I'm so happy you confirmed that.  I was like, well, I am fucking.  How big are we talking, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Peter, how big are we talking?  What do you think Ace was packing?  I'd say he's eight.  Eight?  Maybe not.  But you said he was very wide.  But he's very, yeah.  Girthy.  He's girthy.  He's healthy.  And I was so happy to hear that.  But Peter had to mention that he got Ace by length.  He said I was the longest.  Ace was the thickest.  It really made me kind of, that was a real, of all the things you said in the book, that's 
[03:15:30]  the biggest knife in the stomach for the other guys.  It's the fucking, I had length, he had girth.  And those two had characters.  And could you at least just say what, because Gene, I guess, was really weird about certain  things and what you and Ace would do to Gene while he was sitting there putting his  makeup on?  Well, we kind of put them on his shoulder.  I mean, at this part of our lives, it was a constant erection.  I mean, everything, you didn't need any Viagra, trust me. 
[03:16:00]  And we would sit and get bored, because it would be, back in our day, was you work, you  do an album, you go out and push the album.  Back in the radio days, that's what you did.  We didn't have computers.  You didn't have the internet.  So you're constantly recorded, you're constantly toured with the album, and that's all we ever  did.  Out of boredom, one night I was making up and I got an erection, and I said, you know,  I'll go over to Gene and put this on his shoulder. 
[03:16:30]  And so he was making up, and he kind of looks at me, oh, and he freaks out.  And then Ace got the idea, and so Ace came over and put it on his other shoulder.  And so he's like, oh, you guys.  But he didn't really freak out and throw us away and push us away.  Not that I'm indicating anything, but he actually, after a while, I think, got a really big kick  out of this little game we would play with him.  We never did it to Paul.  No, why not?  I don't know.  Just because, I don't know. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Oh, he's a fantastic boy.  Oh, my God.  I mean, we just didn't, he was not as much, Paul was a, Paul's a very, you don't want  to mess with Paul in certain ways, and he's just not as, Gene was much more funnier to  have fun with that stuff than Paul was.  He was not into carrying on with that.  He didn't like it.  So, stayed away from him.  How annoyed were they? 
[03:17:30]  Because one of the most famous interviews you guys ever did was the Tom Snyder one.  And you mentioned in the book how that's, they said that's the first time me and Ace  kind of took over, and it was very entertaining, and it was very funny, and you watched Gene  and Paul getting very angry.  What was the mood like after that interview, which was, I thought, fantastic.  I did, too.  We went, well, when we got to the dressing room, Ace passed out immediately, hitting the  couch.  I still kept laughing about it, because we had such a great time. 
[03:18:00]  We finally had a great time at an interview.  We finally enjoyed ourselves.  I knew how pissed off they were.  That made it even better, because they didn't finally get to take over the interview and  take over this.  As always, take over, take over, and Gene loves to hear himself talk, so he didn't get  a chance to do that.  And I knew we really got them PO'd, because we did take over, and Tom had the best time  I think of his life.  It's considered one of the best talk shows, the band, in the history we ever did. 
[03:18:30]  And I had a ball.  Tom came in and said, I want to thank you guys.  I had the best time of my life.  And he said, where's Ace?  And he saw him on the floor.  He said, when he wakes up, tell him, I love him.  He sent me a great picture.  And he said, I love your hands, man.  I'd like to see your tint toys one day.  And they were furious.  And I knew, I got a feeling then, we should do this more often, because we got so much  feedback from the fans.  It's about time you and Ace spoke up, and we enjoyed it so much that we tried. 
[03:19:00]  But it still was always a fight to get supremacy of anything in that band.  You felt like those guys were kind of teaming up on you?  Or was it?  Yeah.  Sure.  Absolutely.  It was, you know, rock and roll, this is what kills me, is an attitude to me.  Rock and roll has an attitude.  There's no science.  It doesn't come out of books.  You can't study it.  You're it, or you're not.  You take that attitude with you.  That's why I love the Dolls.  I love the Ramones. 
[03:19:30]  I love bands that were real rock and roll bands.  I still do.  And I felt I was that, you know, that way.  It wasn't a science.  I didn't want to sell coffins.  I didn't care about toys.  I just wanted to make records and rock an audience and have a great time.  That's why I took up the instrument.  There was a science with them.  We were a band, not a brand.  I don't buy that.  We were not a brand.  We were four guys looking to make it, dyed our hair blue-black in a bathtub in the village one day with the great Sean Delaney, rest his soul. 
[03:20:00]  And, you know, we all had the same again where we wanted to go.  Money and power, man, really changes things.  It fucks things up, right?  Yeah, it does.  And I didn't grow up with it.  And, you know, we had in my family a hell of a lot of love.  And we really cared for one another.  And we were a very tight Italian-Irish family.  I used to walk to school for 12 blocks.  I think they were a lot different than we were. 
[03:20:30]  Ace was a Bronx kid.  He was very crazy.  He had a crazy way about him.  And I gyrated to him because I wanted to have fun, too.  I thought that's what rock and roll was, you know, girls.  Don't take yourself so seriously.  It's not a serious thing.  It's a fun thing.  You get up there, you play as loud as you can, have a great time.  And I still feel that way about the music.  Do you think it bugs those guys that you had what became the biggest song in the history of the band?  I mean, and this was, what was it, 76 was Destroyer? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  The band was already huge.  And it wasn't even the first single released.  Didn't they want to be sighted on Detroit Rock City or something?  Oh, they did be sighted.  And thank God.  People start flipping the record over.  I should have his name.  I should know it immediately.  Scott Shannon?  Yes.  Oh.  Got it.  And he was wondering.  I should know these things.  Turned it over and said, let me see what this song sounds like.  Good for him.  The phone never stopped ringing off the hook.  And Destroyer was sinking, by the way. 
[03:21:30]  Was it really?  It was not doing well.  It was really going down the tubes.  And Beth got us on the radio, got airplay, took the album up to go platinum, double platinum.  And the rest was...  Wait, let me...  I got to ask.  They never came to my face.  They never told me to my face that they hated the fact that I wrote the biggest hit in the band.  But I indicated that when they were sitting in the console room, and I was doing the first vocals for it.  And they were making funny faces and laughing at me.  Oh, man.  And acting like they were crying. 
[03:22:00]  It was the worst thing.  And Ezrin threw them out.  He said, get the hell out of my studio.  I want to do this song.  I think this is a great, great song for you guys.  But a lot of guys in your camp didn't realize the potential of the song, which is unbelievable to me.  I didn't either.  You really didn't?  No, I didn't.  I just was happy to get a song finally in the band.  I always was kind of shunned with that.  And so was the other guy.  And I always kept trying to get a song.  And finally, I got the first ballot.  And again, they tried to bury it.  But that didn't work out. 
[03:22:30]  Gene said, and I read, I think your account's a little bit too.  How long is that clip?  A minute.  You got a minute there, Peter?  Is this accurate?  You guys like it all day.  Is this accurate or no?  Yeah, Gene Simmons, we asked about Beth.  Can you hear this?  Wait till we play it.  Peter was sitting with me in the limo.  We were driving to Flint, Michigan.  It's a true story.  And we were going to go do two shows sold out.  It was a big deal in the 1800s.  And, you know, Peter can't write songs. 
[03:23:00]  It was his friend Stan Penridge and a guy named Bob Ezrin who produced.  But anyway, Peter got writing credit.  And he goes, Beck, I hear you calling.  What's that?  What's that thing?  He goes, ah, I wrote this.  Come on, you didn't write this.  Stan Penridge wrote it.  Yeah, and it goes like this.  Beck, I hear you calling.  You know, that's pretty good.  You should sing it to Bob Ezrin, our producer.  Give me that fucking thing.  I should give it to Bob Ezrin, our producer, because he might like it. 
[03:23:30]  You know, it could be on our next record and stuff.  Destroyer.  Really?  Yeah, but the Beck thing doesn't work.  Beck, I hear you calling.  You should get rid of that.  How about Beth?  Otherwise, they'll think you're in love with Jeff Beck.  Because Beck was for Becky.  Beck, I hear you calling.  So it didn't work.  Beck, I hear you.  So I suggested he get rid of the k and Beth, I hear you.  That sounds better.  And that's the story of Beth.  But he didn't write it.  Wow.  Peter doesn't play musical instrument. 
[03:24:00]  He's a sweet guy.  We love him.  But it's a guy named Stan Penridge.  And Bob Ezrin wrote the middle section.  Have you ever told this story before?  Yeah, I don't think so.  I hope we make some headlines today.  A scoop?  Why not?  There you go.  That was Gene Simmons.  From 2008.  No.  Wow.  What are you going to do with him?  What are you going to do with him?  Put him back on that reality show, right?  Another facelift. 
[03:24:30]  Look, I wrote this song with Stan.  We wrote it in 69 about a guitar player's wife who kept calling the studio, kept calling  rehearsal because she wanted to talk to him.  Her name was Rebecca.  We did it for a joke, so we wrote, Beck, we hear you calling, can't come home right  now.  I was in a limo with Gene.  We were together.  I knew he'd hate the song because kiss don't do ballads.  That's what he used to say.  So I spruced it up and I played on his leg and I sang the song in an uptempo. 
[03:25:00]  He had nothing to do with the title.  Bob Ezrin, I sat next to him finally behind a baby gram when he was getting ready to do  the album.  I sang it to him.  He said, I love it.  Let's get it.  Let's get the Philharmonic.  I said, you've got to be kidding me.  Do you like the New York Philharmonic that's going to play on my song?  I said, no, absolutely.  We need to do a great arrangement.  We need to do a big, big arrangement on this.  But I don't like the title.  It's ridiculous.  We need to change the title.  I said, well, what do you want to change it to?  Anything you want to change it to. 
[03:25:30]  Once he said New York Philharmonic, my song was, I would have done anything.  And he said, I think Beth would be a great name for this song.  And I said, deal.  Fine.  And so Bob took the song.  Absolutely.  He went in.  He arranged that great arrangement.  We came back to sing it.  And those two fools sat in the console room laughing.  Until today, they could laugh and say, I can't write.  But I still wrote the biggest song.  I won a People's Choice Award for it.  And every other song I think I wrote was pretty damn good. 
[03:26:00]  I did more solo albums than those guys ever did, whether they all sold.  They didn't sell maybe millions of records.  But I consider myself a damn good songwriter.  And I think I, and I'll still say I have the best voice in the band.  I always had the most rock and roll voice.  You know, it's not bragging, but I believe that.  The man's out of his mind.  He always has been.  If he could put a television in front of his face and two things, he would be happy to talk to them. 
[03:26:30]  I nicknamed him Professor Dope.  Why would I nickname a man Professor Dope?  You know, for a guy who's calling me this.  You know, we get into, I said this, I said that.  In my book, I mention they were Machiavellians.  These guys are major trippers about power, power, power.  I got the power.  And when we got back here, I felt like I started General Motors with all of us.  And next thing, I'm working for General Motors.  And they're making me know that.  Trust me, dude.  Every day, I felt belittled. 
[03:27:00]  I was treated like a secondhand citizen.  No, it was brutal.  And if not, that I didn't.  And I'll say it.  I needed the money.  I was down at that point in my life.  For the reunion, you mean?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And I prayed to God real hard for a second chance.  And when it came, I knew that was a second chance.  I knew we were going to make a lot of money.  And I shaped up immediately.  I did everything I had to do, was told to do, and did it.  I never got stoned on that whole tour ever. 
[03:27:30]  I stopped doing that back in 82 when I went to a rehab.  I did what I had to do to make it work.  And it was brutal.  It was not easy every day to see these guys sitting around like now they're the big shots  and the kings of the band.  And all of a sudden, now I'm reading write-ups that Ace and I were drunks and drug addicts.  And that wasn't the first reason why I left the band.  It was like we had, I think it was oddest indifferences.  And they had other better words.  But the minute they owned it and got it, then they could slap us in the face. 
[03:28:00]  Can I ask, too, because you had a 25% share of the band.  All of you guys, and even when you left, you got a quarter of the band.  Yes.  Which probably fucking drove them nuts.  Yeah, it did.  How did you lose that?  Because I wasn't clear on that.  And what happened?  Did you just sign the wrong paperwork and all of a sudden it was gone?  Yeah, I did.  Bad lawyers.  Bad under the bus.  Trust.  Again, I'm a kid who, you know, I trust people.  I wear my heart.  They took advantage.  I wear my heart on the sleeve.  Who would give up 25%?  They obviously took advantage of you in a weak spot. 
[03:28:30]  I believe so.  I wasn't paying attention.  I definitely would.  No.  Over my dead body.  Over my dead body.  So, no, I wasn't paying attention.  I was signing things because my lawyer said it was a good thing.  My manager at the time said it was a good thing.  Was he in cahoots with these guys?  Absolutely.  I had the same manager Ace had.  I had the same lawyer Ace had.  That right there was insanity.  You can't usually have the same lawyers.  Right.  Yeah.  Sure.  No one didn't say. 
[03:29:00]  And I should have paid attention.  I wasn't paying attention.  I was paying more attention to relearning Kiss because it was 17 years since I played that  stuff.  I was out of the ballpark.  It was really tough for me.  I hated me that I had to learn my drumming again because it was so technical.  I couldn't believe how technical it was.  And so I had to relearn all of that.  I had no time to think about lawyers and business managers and this.  I trusted all these guys that were working for me. 
[03:29:30]  I believe they had my heart and my best interest and they didn't.  How hard was it to go from arenas to some of the slimmer solo years where there was times  where things were looking good and you were doing some tours?  And then you tell stories and hear about when you get to this place and there's 50 people  waiting for you or there's 100 people in the club.  And what type of mentality does that put you in when you're going through this kind of valley?  It was the lowest for me. 
[03:30:00]  I mean, although it saved my life, this band, a little band.  They were young guys.  They were happy as hell to tour with me.  I was a big star as far as they were concerned in their eyes.  And again, I went through my divorce.  I went through my face problem.  I still was going through a lot of pain.  I had a chump little record deal on a label called TNT.  I figured at least it's an album.  We got an old Eagle.  We got on it and we toured.  And by working and by playing, it at least eased my pain of not being with my wife and daughter anymore, 
[03:30:30]  not having that kind of life I was used to.  And I was still playing drums, though, and that alone saved me for wanting to hang in there and do my thing.  But it was horrifying.  We once played a place called The Sandbox, and it was.  They actually filled the floor with sand from a beach.  And so when I got there, I had to put behind the drums, which is on a plank of a little floor, 
[03:31:00]  and they started dancing.  There was so much junk in the air and sand that you couldn't breathe.  And I got back in the bus and I probably drank 25 Rolling Rocks and drank myself to sleep.  I was miserable.  It was a really lean, hard time in my life.  Getting back again with them, they knew it.  They knew I was easy pickings.  You could see it all over my face.  You could tell my demeanor was down.  I was still, my eye was still pretty much down here.  I had to get surgery.  So they had me right where they wanted me, right, right. 
[03:31:30]  And I guess ace too, but I won't speak for him.  There are some.  Let me give you book signing plugs, too.  Peter is signing today, Tuesday at 1230.  The book comes out today.  It's the Barnes & Noble here in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue and 46th.  That's a good big bookstore, so get there.  There will be availability.  And you get to get your book signed by Peter.  And then tomorrow, if you're in Jersey, it's Bookends.  It's that great independent bookstore, which is, again, there's a huge downstairs. 
[03:32:00]  If it rains, there's plenty of room to be inside.  You get your book signed there.  Tomorrow, 6 p.m., so you can go right after work.  And then Saturday, this coming Saturday, 7 o'clock, the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown.  So he's going to hit South Jersey a little bit.  And there's a Barnes & Noble there.  So there's three chances in this area to meet Peter and get your book signed.  And just to finalize and say there's so much we couldn't – there's the fucking – the mafia involvement. 
[03:32:30]  The fucking – there's so much shit in this book that there's no way to do it justice in a 30-minute interview.  I'm not even just saying this because I love you.  I can't recommend this book high enough.  What about The Hog?  Well, you know, I don't want to ask Peter.  You got to hear this, Peter.  You got to hear this.  I really got it.  You have to.  You have to hear the tape.  You have to.  I can hear it.  This is a good one.  When I was a kid – and Paul did not like this story.  When I was a kid, you guys were my heroes, of course. 
[03:33:00]  I mean, my – you know, you were larger than life.  But so I would have this really recurring fantasy that Kiss would show up to my house and beat me and hurt me and throw me down the stairs and then hug me and love me and make me all better.  How stupid is that?  So all he's looking for is a hug.  I don't know why.  Just to bring it all together, maybe.  It's like the circle of life.  Thanks, Peter.  See?  There's a great hug right there.  The final member I got my hug from.  He's got a hug from every single one of you guys now. 
[03:33:30]  Paul did it on 57th Street under fucking – under duress.  I think he was forced by Kenny or somebody.  Yeah.  Give him a hug.  There might have been guns involved.  I don't know, Peter.  But you did it willingly.  You know what's great, though?  I'm proud because, I mean, Scribner's not chump.  This is really a great book company.  Yes.  Always open your door for me, and that's so cool.  Really, you know, being a New Yorker, you guys are New Yorkers.  Yes.  It's nice.  It's nice to be like home. 
[03:34:00]  God bless you guys.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Ben.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Yeah.  Serious XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's an action-packed show.  Oh, my God.  Hook had just walked in here with a Spider-Man mask on.  Can you hear me?  I can hear you.  I'm the nigga Spider-Man, yo.  All right.  Let me take a picture.  Yeah, we got an Instagram. 
[03:34:30]  Of –  You got an Instagram for –  And we're Spider-Man.  Yeah.  Yeah, because this week I'm going to be the nigga Spider-Man, and then next week I'm going  to be the nigga Batman.  So I got to be two –  All right.  I got you.  Heroes of black people.  You know what I'm saying?  Is that what's going on?  I was web-swinging on these hoes.  I was noticing on your Instagram, DJ Hookin on Instagram, quite a few hoes met the –  It's hard to breathe through this stuff.  I mean, I took the picture.  You can –  I don't know how to –  You don't know how to take it off? 
[03:35:00]  Fuck he did that, yo.  Jesus Christ, Hookin.  These white superheroes are ill.  It was a big day today.  It was a Jimmy Guest day.  I know.  I heard all the gyrating.  There was.  There was an energy.  Well, Peter –  You know Kiss, the band Kiss?  Yeah, of course.  That's Jim's, like, childhood heroes.  Like Kiss.  I heard him on the show.  Peter Criss.  But why he kept saying gyrating, though?  I don't know if he kept saying gyrating.  He said, you made me gyrate.  I don't know if he actually said that.  He said that.  I heard it.  Why would I remember that?  I'm glad.  He said to Peter Criss, you make me gyrate? 
[03:35:30]  He said, I love gyrating.  That's the only word I heard.  Okay.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe you got all your shows confused together.  No.  Gyrating.  Maybe he said that.  Maybe he didn't.  But a lot of casualties around here of Jimmy Guest Day.  We've talked about this on the show before.  Jimmy Guest Day is when somebody comes in.  Because Jim is an obsessive person.  You know that.  Of course.  You've heard about his sexual addiction quite a bit.  He's an obsessive person.  I know, Sal, you were a casualty of Jimmy Guest Day. 
[03:36:00]  You learned the hard way.  Sal is now doing the prep sheets for the guests.  Like, you know, the little bios.  I finally got taken off.  I have years, who kid, years of criticism on the research I was doing for these guests.  I finally, but for the grace of God, was removed from that duty, which has been one of the greatest things that's ever happened to me on the show.  It's a wrap.  He took over.  Now, Sal is in charge of the prep sheets.  And today, Sal, you were one of the casualties of Jimmy Guest Day. 
[03:36:30]  Damn.  You got annihilated today?  What am I going to do?  You did.  What am I going to do?  Did you know it was coming?  You've never experienced it.  Oh, I saw it.  It was coming.  I saw it was coming because the whole camera thing was going on.  And the gyrating.  This is happening.  So, it was coming and gyrating.  Yeah.  You're all obsessed with the web slinging.  It's the Cincinnati A's.  We're swinging on these hoes.  It's the Spider-Man things.  Have you been here for Jimmy Guest Day yet?  Yeah, many times.  Well, what was the last one you were here for?  The last one I remember was probably...  I mean, this is not a guest day.  This is a Jimmy Guest Day.  Yeah, no.  A Jimmy Guest Day would be like... 
[03:37:00]  Did he have an erection when he came in?  That's a possibility.  Tony Iommi?  Tony Iommi was a rough one?  That's a Jimmy Guest Day.  Who else would be another show?  So, he has to remember every show?  Yeah, he should.  I mean, these are memorable shows.  Wow.  I don't remember shit.  I know, but white people have to do things like this.  You know, we can't just walk in and start talking shit and impress black people.  It doesn't work in reverse.  I had Hulk Hogan last weekend.  That's it.  The Johnny Rotten one recently.  That was another rough one.  Yeah, but that wasn't Peter Criss level. 
[03:37:30]  No, it wasn't Peter Criss level, but it was definitely Jimmy Guest Day.  But this was the first time you were a casualty.  How did it feel?  It sucks.  It's just like...  You had a lashing?  They lashed you?  He did.  He got a lashing because he wrote the prep sheet.  First of all, if you're going to write a prep sheet for somebody from Kiss and give it  to Norton, there is no right way to do it.  You're not going to win.  Because he's been obsessed with this band since he was a kid.  So, what information are you going to put on that sheet that he's not going to make fun  of?  Every question was wrong, then.  Well, no.  You have to put facts.  And at the same time, you also got to put some interesting things.  And I put a few facts that was brought up in the interview that Peter Criss brought 
[03:38:00]  up.  And I also put things that I think Jimmy might find interesting that he wouldn't happen  to know.  But he probably knew him.  Jimmy probably knew him already.  He probably knew him.  And then he got on your case because, you know, he's throwing that book that you see  there.  Who, kid?  That book is ill, kid.  What's it called?  Makeup to break up.  In your mouth.  Is that makeup like stuff on the face?  It's a pun.  It's what it is.  It's wordplay, who, kid.  They use a little wordplay.  Was he the original, remember they had a TV show where they were flying in midair? 
[03:38:30]  Was he one of them?  I think we were talking about, was that Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park?  Remember Kiss had a TV show.  And they were superheroes.  And they were flying in midair.  I think it's the movie.  The TV movie.  That was a movie?  No.  Oh, that was a weekly show.  Did Kiss have a weekly show, Eric?  I think they did.  I don't know.  That's beyond my...  Well, Sal is the guest prepper, right?  He's fucking old now.  Yeah, well, I mean...  Well, he was 80 walking out of here.  Shit.  Hey, did Kiss have a weekly TV show? 
[03:39:00]  They used to have, like, specials, I think, yearly.  I think you're thinking of their made-for-TV movie.  All I know is they were in midair flying, like, super niggas, man.  Yeah.  Wrestling Frankenstein?  Yeah, it was, like, all four of them.  And they were, like, shh.  Right.  But, yeah, he was on...  Jim was on Sal's case because he didn't write anything from the book on the prep sheet.  No, I put some facts that were only revealed from the book on the prep sheet.  You did.  I did.  You should have defended yourself.  You didn't even have the TV show question.  Well, I'm going to come in during a Jimmy interview.  Get the fuck out of here.  Well, right before you could. 
[03:39:30]  And then I was in here, and Opie...  I was holding the camera because you did video everything.  Okay.  I was holding the video camera, though, because Peter Criss isn't here yet.  And Opie starts asking about Jocktober, a celebration we do that I'm in charge of.  Jocktober?  Yeah.  You know how all radio stations...  I mean, maybe hip-hop stations don't do it as much.  Underwear or something?  What was that about?  No, man.  No.  Not Jock straps.  No, no.  Fuck each other.  Okay.  No, we don't do that.  What it is is...  You know, other radio stations do Rocktober. 
[03:40:00]  Like, that's a big thing for a radio station.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do Rocktober.  They play rock songs.  So five years ago...  I can't believe it's been that long, but five years ago, we started doing Jocktober, where  every day for the month of October...  Like hunks, they come through here.  No, man.  No, not hunks.  That's a jock, right?  No, I'm talking about disc jockeys.  Oh, they're like, you're on my jock, like you're on my dick.  No.  Oh, okay.  No, I'm talking about radio jocks.  And what we do is, every day, we find a random show in America. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, okay.  Or Canada.  Which is a totally random show, and I listen to them, and I pull clips, and then we just  kill them.  I think I heard one of them shows you did.  Yeah.  Right.  I walk them away.  We kill them.  So the suckier, the better.  Right.  So that's Jocktober.  Where was I going?  Before, I had to explain Jocktober.  You're saying something about Ope was about to set it up?  Ope was about to do Jocktober?  Right.  So Ope calls me in, and he's asking a question about Jocktober, because we didn't do it today.  Yes, I noticed.  Yes, thank you.  We didn't do it today.  And so I started answering, and Peter Chris is not in the room yet. 
[03:41:00]  And Jim looks at me like I'm crazy, and he goes, while I'm answering Ope's question on  the end, he goes, what?  What the fuck are you doing?  Put the camera on.  What the fuck are you doing?  I'm just like, I was answering the question.  Don't plug it in.  Turn it on.  What the fuck?  It's Jimmy Guest Day.  I was a casualty.  You saw it go down?  I screamed at you too, son?  He screamed at me.  I've been casualty before.  You got props.  I get, well, I get a little of both. 
[03:41:30]  Dibs.  I get a little.  What's dibs?  It's like, you know, like.  That sounds a little sexual to me.  It's gyrating.  Oh, yeah.  It sounds about the same.  I can't believe you didn't hear that word.  I heard it.  Sal, you were listening to the interview.  That's the first thing I heard.  I heard gyrating.  Like, yo.  I don't remember hearing gyrating.  Peter Criss was like, yo, I love gyrating.  I don't know.  All right, Eric, can you see if we can find.  Can we rewind the goddamn audio?  Can you find the clip of Peter Criss saying.  Am I going crazy?  I love gyrating.  Well, you do have a Spider-Man mask on your head.  I'm a spider nigga right now.  Yo. 
[03:42:00]  I heard that.  This was towards the end of the interview?  It was like towards the end, just before ONA got off.  And he said, I love.  You're actually making poor Eric look for you.  I love gyrating.  Gyrating is great.  Are you sure he said that, Sal?  Actually, you know, I think he did.  He might have.  I'm not sure.  I heard it now.  I turned on your show in your office, and that's the first thing I heard.  I was like, I'm going to kill this guy.  This guy's a Kiss legend talking about gyrating.  Gyrating, what?  Eric, were you a casualty of Jimmy Day at all?  Jimmy Guest Day?  Today, no.  You skated.  Yeah, I had nothing to do with it. 
[03:42:30]  He hit it in the corner.  Because luckily, you know why?  I'll tell you why.  Because Jim already has so many Kiss autographs that it's okay.  Like, he's got Peter Christie.  He's got a bunch of stuff.  Normally, Eric would have been in charge of getting things autographed.  Oh, okay.  You know what I mean?  And that's a very...  Malcolm McDowell day was rough.  Why was that?  You know Malcolm McDowell is?  I don't know who you're talking about.  Clockwork Orange.  Yeah.  Caligula.  Liam, by the way, our talent booker, is walking down the hall laughing at you because  he just sees Who Kid with his...  You know, Who Kid is still wearing his Spider-Man mask, by the way. 
[03:43:00]  Spider-Nega, man.  Let me Instagram that while you're explaining.  I can't even talk to this.  How the fuck he...  Eric, explain what happened.  Swinging through the hood.  The night before, Jim went out and bought over $2,000 worth of Clockwork Orange memorabilia.  Memorabilia?  Oh, no way.  Like, theater cut posters, old Playbill...  I mean, not Playbill, but old...  Those special cuts that they put by the ticket booth.  Shit, he went in, son.  From Japan and Europe. 
[03:43:30]  What?  Yeah, he...  This whole...  That whole corner there was set up like a museum.  He signed all of them?  Everything.  And you had to make sure that everything...  I mean, this is $2,000 worth of stuff.  I had multiple markers ready to go at all times.  Like, nothing could be ruined.  Is there anybody...  I mean, you kind of freak out when Star Wars nerds are in here.  Oh, I go nuts, man.  I got a boner and everything.  And Who Kid...  You know what...  And Eric, this is a great idea because you love your memorabilia.  You know what Who Kid does?  Because every time there's somebody from a gangster movie in here, Who Kid gets them 
[03:44:00]  to sign a baseball bat.  Yeah.  And I go...  I go...  Who Kid...  Why would you...  Why would you get them to sign a baseball bat?  And he goes, because they're gangsters.  They hit people with baseball bats.  I'm gonna...  I got Ray Liotta soon.  I'm gonna get him to sign it and then I'm gonna hit my wife with it.  Is that why you had one with Carol Burnett?  Yeah.  Oh!  She's gangster, yo.  Okay.  We got the quote, Eric.  She's dope.  Okay.  Thank God for Anthony Coombe.  At least there's one professional broadcaster around here.  Peter said that he gyrated more towards Ace, but what he meant was gravitated. 
[03:44:30]  So why is he using such a sexual word for that?  That's very homoistic.  You think so?  Yeah, I like it.  And that's why you came in and go...  You enjoy it.  I love it.  You're a sexual guy.  It's okay to be homo now.  It is?  I got this gay-ass Spider-Man on my head.  Right?  After...  Hang on.  I'm writing this down.  I told you I heard it.  I was not going crazy.  I told you.  You did hear him say it right now.  Thank you.  Calling himself as... 
[03:45:00]  Gay, man!  Spider...  I'm putting this on Instagram right now so everybody can see it.  Peter Kress!  And word.  Okay, go check out Not Sam on Twitter and Instagram.  It's...  It's...  Pass through.  All right.  So now everybody can see that you're dressed as...  Spider...  Nigga.  Spider nigga.  For whatever reason it is.  Method Man is going to sue him, though, Peter Kress.  You know, that's the title of his biggest song.  Him and Mary J. Blouse have make-up to break-ups.  Really?  Yeah, so there's going to be a lawsuit.  First cover.  Is there going to be some kind of classic rock, classic hip-hop beef happening? 
[03:45:30]  Guaranteed, man.  You know I...  60-year-old nigga gotta go.  You know who, kid?  You know who you missed who was on the after show last week?  Who was there?  Vivica A. Fox was in here.  What?  Yep.  Was her, like, body parts in here?  Yeah, of course.  Yes, of course her body parts were in here.  She had them attached to her.  It's funny you said that.  And she was saying...  I talked to her about 50 Cent a little bit.  Oh, for real?  Yeah.  What did they talk about?  Well, she said that 50 was one of the loves of her life. 
[03:46:00]  And that he was delicious.  And that she implied that they had sexual intercourse quite a bit.  Get out of here.  That's right.  That's right.  And then...  That's not what Fifth told me.  What did Fifth tell you?  He was like, do you not?  He said not.  Wow.  Because I heard in the game song, he said, anything is possible with 50 Fucked Vivica.  Right.  So I thought that was, like, something you guys in hip-hop, you know, felt true about.  I don't know, man.  She was very infatuated with him.  Reef, you're... 
[03:46:30]  Who kid?  Your boss, Reef, just walked in here.  Yeah.  And he sees you wearing a Spider-Man outfit.  This is a big day for who kid?  Man, nigga, Spider-Man.  You know what I'm saying?  I need you.  I mean, you were on...  This is a big day for you because you were on...  Oh, I was with your boy.  You were on Howard Stern's show today.  You're a two-timing whore.  I had all these people texting me going, what the fuck?  What's DJ Who Kid doing on that?  I was like, it's cool.  I love every show up here.  This is a serious sexism.  You're a two-timing male whore.  I guess I gotta choose a side or something.  Everybody knows DJ Who Kid is a whore, man.  I thought I was white. 
[03:47:00]  I don't know.  He's trying to get that white audience however he can.  You've seen him, Reef, over the years.  Who Kid is just struggling to get those white folks.  Listen, listen, listen.  I'm white moisturized.  This guy is going for the white party.  He loves it.  Peter Criss talking about gyrating today.  Who Kid is about two steps away from voting for Mitt Romney, just so white people love him.  Nah, I don't know if I can go that far.  I'm a nigga at the end of the day, you know what I mean?  But yeah, Vivica A. Fox was in here.  And you know what she said at the end of the interview?  She took off her shoe.  I thought she took off her fucking arm. 
[03:47:30]  No, she took off her arm.  Her body parts are attached.  She took off her shoe.  So you think.  And she had a giant spike heel on.  Wow.  And Nicole from the morning mashup was in here and she called them fuck me pumps.  Wow.  And she said, see, you want to bang Vivica because of those shoes.  And I said I wanted to before I saw the shoes.  What?  And then Vivica said, yeah, we'll do them with these shoes and made a motion as if she was  going to shove the heel of her shoe up my asshole.  Did you do it?  No.  The show ended. 
[03:48:00]  We didn't have any time left.  That would have been history.  You wouldn't.  You wouldn't.  Now.  I don't know if I would have did that.  You wouldn't.  I would put it in my mouth.  You would put it in your mouth.  I like heels in my mouth.  A minute ago, you said you were okay with Peter Criss gyrating on Ace.  Let's kiss, though.  You don't mind kiss gyrating on each other.  It's a rock group.  Wait a minute.  They were gay?  Well, Peter Criss, unfortunately, he said he gyrated towards Ace Frehley.  He meant gravitated towards.  But he said gyrated.  That's all who kid or spider.  Because I got this homo alarm in my wallet and it goes off. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  And you said Spider-Man?  Spider-Nigger.  Oh, right, right, right.  Okay.  I got that wrong.  I'm swinging these hoes.  Now, what were you doing?  What were you doing on Howard Stern Show?  It was a white rap battle.  A white rap battle.  It was two white dudes that were battling each other and I had to judge him.  They were horrible.  Both of them were?  Yeah, they sucked ass.  Did Howard Stern get any...  Two homos, huh?  Two homos.  Yo, that's what homos do, right?  It might say something that's not scientific. 
[03:49:00]  I don't know if homos rap or not.  They suck ass.  They suck each other ass.  I guess so, if they're in love.  Now, tell me this.  I need to know.  Did Howard Stern get any information out of you that I have not been able to get out of you?  Because then I will feel betrayed.  I don't think so.  Nah, he didn't get nothing out of me.  You know, my secrets is with you, man.  Right, because you'll come in here.  Did you talk about Lil Wayne on Howard Stern's show?  Only his pants, but none of them.  What, jeggings specifically?  Yeah, jeggings.  Okay, good.  We've had the jeggings conversation before.  Very generic, very generic. 
[03:49:30]  Who wears jeggings?  I got jeggings on now.  Yeah, you do, because you want that white vote that Lil Wayne has.  You're going to start skateboarding and stuff.  He wants to do wheezy.  You do?  Would you have sex with Lil Wayne?  Nah.  You wouldn't?  I don't know.  He's kissing people now, so I don't know.  Who is he kissing?  He just kissed, what's his name, right?  Who, Lil Wayne?  The guy from Love of Hip Hop, what's his name?  The guy?  Lil Wayne?  Stevie, whatever, Stevie J, right?  Lil Wayne kissed a guy named Stevie J?  Well, you're a man at with the internet.  Stop starting.  Is this true?  He kissed him in the mouth. 
[03:50:00]  Sal, what do you know about this?  You know, you kind of have a pulse on hip hop.  Get Sal on the internet, man.  I have no fucking clue.  Did Lil Wayne kiss a man named Stevie J?  Listen, listen.  We're looking it up right now.  Everyone listening, do yourselves a favor.  Yeah.  Don't listen to this guy because...  It's online.  Reeve, you're Who Kid's boss from Shade 45.  You have to deal with this.  I have to deflect.  Yeah.  It's online.  This guy will talk shit about more people.  Yeah.  Do you get a lot of lawsuits that are based around DJ Who Kid?  We have a drop that we spontaneously use. 
[03:50:30]  The views of DJ Who Kid are not that of Shade 45 or Sirius XM.  Right.  Because he comes in and he talks shit.  It looks out.  Prove me wrong.  I know I lie a lot.  All right.  And I got this gay ass Spider-Man shit on my head.  That's right.  What?  Is it Spider-Man?  It's a spider nigga.  Oh.  Look up Lil Wayne.  Stevie J.  Tongue.  Stevie J.  Just a kiss.  Don't write tongue.  That's a little specific, Who Kid.  That's a little specific because I sure don't know if they tongue...  Was it a tongue kiss? 
[03:51:00]  I mean, the videos don't lie, man.  It's video now.  Shit is real out there.  It's like Tupac on the internet.  Shit is real in the streets.  It's Tupac right now, baby.  Wow.  You have this guy on enough that I think I should give you the drop.  Yeah.  You can just hit it.  Like when he says some outlandish shit, just be like,  The views of DJ Who Kid are not.  Do not reflect those of Sam Roberts.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  What's this?  And this shit happens with the video says.  See?  Look, look.  You think I'm lying.  Look.  Okay.  I mean, Reef, you're seeing it for yourself.  At Club Live, the famous club in Miami. 
[03:51:30]  That looks like Stevie J.  And he wiped his mouth.  It looks like they're kissing each other on the lips.  Oh, wait a minute.  I told you.  Look.  This is live in Miami.  You're the boss.  You're...  I don't know.  It's dark, though.  I can't 100% tell.  People think I lie, but...  But that's flagrant enough.  You're the boss of Shade 45.  Thank you.  You get a pass.  Real.  Real.  You know what I'm saying?  I heard Peter Criss talk about gyrating,  and now you see Lil Wayne tonguing fucking dudes.  Yes.  Only.  Only here.  Eat a dick, Howard Stern.  We got the exclusive. 
[03:52:00]  We got the exclusive tongue.  You didn't talk about this on Howard, did you?  No, I didn't.  Thank God.  We got the exclusive only on After Open Anthem Live.  And I got this gay Spider-Man shit on my head.  Only here.  You didn't tell Howard about it?  Nah, don't spider nigger, no nothing.  Yeah.  Did you say the N-word on Howard Stern?  I said, what up, my niggas?  Okay, good.  Okay.  All right.  But that's me, though.  It makes white people feel more comfortable when you come in.  Yeah, they're comfortable as fuck, sir.  Yeah, they like it.  Yo, I felt like the calmness.  How did you end up in charge of Shade 45, Reef?  You know, I know people. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, he's Jewish.  Oh, is that what it is?  Is it Jewish?  Okay.  That makes a lot of sense.  I know.  I'm all right.  Eminem's manager and myself go.  We go way back.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So when we were, you know, flat broke.  Hell yeah.  Shit.  Everybody comes up together.  I know.  That's right.  Especially, especially Who Kid comes up with everybody.  He comes wherever.  You love that word, come, huh?  No, but he did What Up Gangsta, 50 Cent's biggest record ever.  What do you mean he did it?  He produced it.  You're the producer of What Up Gangsta?  What Up Gangsta?  Wow. 
[03:53:00]  What Up Gangsta?  That's a huge song.  I have my permanent hood pass.  Yeah, that's it.  You don't really need to, do you, so are you a producer?  Yeah.  You know, I do it all.  But you don't really need to produce after that song, do you?  Yeah.  Like you have that song.  First Jew unit.  You know what I'm saying?  Is that what?  No, no, no.  Paul was first.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  What do you play?  Sal, give me What Up Gangsta.  What are you, texting?  It's amazing.  Look at Stevie J kissing.  I think he has a burner from Lil Wayne tongue in.  Exactly.  He's jerking off. 
[03:53:30]  He's got him super slow-mo.  He's jerking off the Lil Wayne and Stevie J kissing.  You're still watching that?  Can you find that song for me, Sal?  Sal, put it on Zoom.  What's the name of the song?  What Up Gangsta.  50 Cent.  It's a giant song.  From the Get Rich or Die Trying LP.  And you produced that song.  Yes, I did.  And that, for white people, produce means you made the beat.  I made the track, yeah.  Right, right, right.  The biggest 50 Cent record.  We still perform it to this day.  People love it.  They love it.  Even white girls love that song.  Yeah.  It's true.  My wife loves that song. 
[03:54:00]  Really?  She's a white Jewish girl.  Let me tell you, I've not seen a lot of white people.  You know that song, right?  What Up Gangsta?  Can you scream the hook if you know it?  Well, I'm not going to embarrass myself.  I mean, that's just humiliating.  What Up Gangsta?  There it is.  There it goes.  This is history for you.  This is the first white hip-hop record.  I had no idea.  No, it's not.  A white man created this beat.  Yes.  This is great for our people.  This is.  A Jewish man, too.  Wow. 
[03:54:30]  This is big, son.  This is a huge song.  History.  Yeah.  No, it's a good story with this whole thing.  Yeah?  Because we had done this before he even had his deal.  Right, because this was before in a club.  This was when Ja Rule got punched in his face.  Yep.  Wasn't this like a kind of bonus track on this album?  No, this was the intro, right after the little drop in quarters.  Right, right, right.  The drop in quarters.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I put it together.  I never got paid for that.  That's the only thing I produced on the album is the two quarters dropping in the intro. 
[03:55:00]  Is your name any credits?  Yeah, I hate 50, man.  Turn the mic off.  Meanwhile, you just came back from Dubai with Sif.  I know.  Got any good stories?  Of course he does.  By the way, your Instagram gets me in so much trouble.  Seriously?  I don't know how.  Like, when my wife is looking at your Instagram.  You're in the photo.  Yeah, you can't hang out with this guy.  Well, fortunately, I know what type of photos to take with you.  But she's like, the only thing that are in his, who gets Instagram is pictures of bitches. 
[03:55:30]  Now, I saw one photo on your Instagram of what appeared to be a female's ass in the shower.  And it was nude.  Yeah, she stood up.  How do you get that picture?  She stood up from the tub.  How do you get, you just slide in there with your camera phone?  Or say, I need to take a photo of you taking a bath.  Yeah, he slipped it in.  That's it.  Now, clearly, because of your Instagram, I'm never going to be able to go on the road with you.  Never.  Ever.  A, and then B, I'm getting all these questions about your personal life.  Like, wait, isn't he married? 
[03:56:00]  Like, what?  Yeah, but you explained that before.  You are married, who kid, but?  I fuck bitches.  Right, you cheat, correct?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  That's what every man does.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, but not quite as often as you, I don't think.  Turn the reef mic off real quick.  Now, you fuck bitches, what, on the daily?  For those of you that do have an iPhone or what have you, in addition to having your SiriusXM mobile app.  Oh my god, you're a company man.  I am, I am.  You are?  True blue.  Yeah.  Go follow DJ Who Kid on Instagram.  Always interesting. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, always.  All those fucking bitches.  You fuck a lot of bitches.  Do you fuck all these bitches that are on your Instagram?  Yeah.  You do?  Now, when you get bitches doing the kissy cam thing, who kid has this thing when he's DJing?  Kissy kissy tour.  I guess he gets bored and he just starts getting girls to kiss each other.  He takes their photos, he puts them on Instagram.  Do you fuck a lot of these girls, too?  Yeah.  You do?  What the fuck do you think I'm doing out there?  I don't know.  DJing, I thought you were a word.  I'm a spider nigger.  I gotta web swing these hoes.  Is that what it is?  So where did this Spider-Man mask come from?  I don't know. 
[03:57:00]  Everybody thought I was a spider nigger because every time I touch a bitch, I get sticky on him.  And when you say web slinging, you mean you're shooting come at them, correct?  Actually, you know, in the hood, you know, like in the Bronx or Brooklyn, I used to swing from the building to building.  Right.  So they used to call me Spider-Nigger.  No, and it's also referred to Superman that hoe, correct?  That's some Soulja Boy bullshit.  Okay.  Not negative.  That's gyrating right there.  Oh, okay.  That's some gyrating shit.  I'll try to avoid that. 
[03:57:30]  Peter Criss.  I'm understanding.  So do you ever worry about, like, STDs?  No, they got pills for that, right?  I don't think so, no.  There's no pills for that?  I mean, there's pills for some, but, like, you know.  You never caught herpes in your mouth or anything like that?  Herpes isn't good.  There's no cure for herpes.  I don't have it.  You don't have herpes?  Do you?  I don't have anything.  I don't think that's true.  I don't think you have herpes.  I saw something in your mouth one time when you were up here talking.  I don't know what that was, but people do wonder how I ended up getting on your show.  I don't know.  Were you eating beets that day? 
[03:58:00]  I don't know what it was.  I'm not sure.  It's kind of bloody that day.  So you have no STDs?  No.  Have you ever had any?  You've had the crabs.  I had the crabs when I was young.  You never want to admit to crabs in high school.  I didn't have crabs.  Although, what did Akon say on your show once?  He said he had crabs many times in high school.  He's in Africa.  He's fucking in Africa, man.  He said every man has had crabs.  He's African.  I mean, it's a rite of passage.  Right, right, right.  I guess.  He must have crabs for six weeks.  Reeve said he never had crabs either, which I find that very odd.  So why is that?  I mean, I've never...  But he's so hairy. 
[03:58:30]  Oh.  Are you a hairy guy, Reeve?  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  Shit.  Now, how often would you say...  That's because I've hooked mad bitches back in the day.  How often would you say you have intercourse?  Sexual intercourse?  Probably like, I don't know, two, three times a week.  Two, three times a week, but it's all with different bitches.  Yeah, always.  Like, I probably have intercourse about the same amount of time.  It's always with my wife, though.  It's always the same girl.  Serious?  Yeah.  That sucks.  Do you sleep in separate beds?  You and your wife.  That's a great question, right?  I sleep in the same bed with her.  I just don't fuck her. 
[03:59:00]  You don't?  Mm-mm.  Mainly because your dick is worn out from all the bitches on the road.  Spotted niggas out there, yo.  You know how many enemies I fight every day?  So does your wife ever ask you to have sex?  Yeah.  And it's always like married with children, like Al never wants to have sex?  Yo, perfect.  Same thing.  Except the black version.  The nigga version, yeah.  Right, right, right.  Now, but doesn't your wife ever say, listen, I've seen your Instagram.  I know you're having sex with other women.  She has a Blackberry, so she's in the dark.  She doesn't look into Instagram.  She doesn't know anything.  She doesn't.  She has no idea.  He keeps her in the dark. 
[03:59:30]  So you come back.  I'll bet he does.  So you come back.  And as a matter of fact, her car definitely doesn't have Sirius XM.  No.  It actually has an 8-track player.  So you won't allow her to have modern technology.  And a ham radio.  Right.  She ain't hearing shit.  No.  It's like she ain't getting shit.  Nobody's getting this dick in that house.  You know what I'm saying?  Right, right.  Now you come back, though.  You come back on the road, and she's like, I would really like that dick of yours.  What do you just say, no thank you?  I just said, no, bitch.  Doesn't she ever say, listen, you must be having affairs? 
[04:00:00]  Like, if you really, we haven't had sex in so long.  I know you have a sexual appetite.  Because at one point we were having sex.  That was about two years ago.  You're in this sexually charged hip-hop world.  Yeah.  What's going on here?  Did she ever say this?  Are you on the down low?  Is that the problem?  Does she ever ask that?  She never asks the gay stuff, though.  No.  She never thought that.  She's definitely not gay.  Because you all got a big dick, man.  And gay guys don't have big dicks.  I don't think so.  I don't know for sure.  They fuck each other in the ass.  You can't have a big dick doing that.  That's science.  It makes sense. 
[04:00:30]  What do you know about that?  Do you know how many rappers and R&B singers I know?  Name one.  There's another gay one.  No, we've played this game before.  Say, ah.  Hey, what?  Here's the drop.  Yeah, exactly.  The views of DJ Uke are not bad of Shade 45, OPA, and the insertion.  Exactly.  Not almost every rapper and singer is gay.  Most are.  Most are.  Not Rick James.  Nah, he just did gay acts.  Like, he'll kidnap you and tie you up.  Now, tell me.  Stick you with a dildo.  Your wife never says, like.  And a crack plate.  Your wife never says, why wouldn't you have sex with me? 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, and I said, get the fuck out of here.  We got kids.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's my excuse.  She doesn't.  You don't think that she thinks that.  All right.  Does she go somewhere else to get some action?  I hope so, but.  Would you be okay with that if she was cheating on you?  Yeah, I would.  I'd try to get Hulk Hogan to go over there.  Have you checked your bank account?  Dude, would you.  Would you allow Hulk Hogan to have sex with your wife?  Well, let him tap that.  You would.  What?  But you'd have to film it.  If I get the butt cheeks out there.  Make some cash on the side.  Yeah, you'd get your retirement plan.  Yeah. 
[04:01:30]  Wow.  I can't believe you don't cheat, Sam.  No, I mean, well, I've only been married for, you know, four or five months.  So I'm giving you.  Well, don't worry.  It'll be over soon.  I'm giving you a couple.  Once you have a kid, then, you know.  Then, then.  Then you might as well get yourself a flashlight.  You think so?  Yeah.  Oh, that's too bad.  Six months?  Six, seven months?  Yeah.  No, no.  Give it like two years.  Depending upon when and if you have a baby.  Right.  Okay.  It's not going to be.  Yeah, it'll probably be.  Oh, my fellas out there.  You know what I'm talking about.  A couple years before we have kids.  And then it'll be time for a flashlight or a DJ who kid. 
[04:02:00]  Let me tell you something.  All men cheat.  Exactly right.  All.  Everybody chees.  Nobody want to admit it.  Iraq.  Is Iraq in there?  You look like a cheater.  Iraq.  You have sex with other women outside your marriage?  No, not at all.  You don't.  All right.  Now, is that because nobody will have you or is that your choice?  That's probably the first answer.  Okay.  Okay.  So, Iraq has difficulty cheating because women won't have him.  How much does Iraq weigh?  He weighs about 400 pounds.  Is that right, Eric?  Not true at all.  All right.  I'm misjudged.  I'm just based on sight only.  I don't have a scale.  How much do you weigh? 
[04:02:30]  230.  All right.  So, we're going to get some pussy.  You can pay for pussy.  It's probably more like 265.  Trust me.  Who kid can give you expert advice on the payment option?  He's been known to run up, you know, the hotel.  Would you ever consider going on a tour with who kid and maybe picking up some prostitutes,  some hoes with him?  He can get you black ones, Asian ones, whatever you want.  Would you ever consider that?  For the show is a bit.  I'd get you a black mouth on that dick.  You know what I mean?  You could do that for Eric?  Yeah.  Eric, would you want to?  Please, let it just not be yours. 
[04:03:00]  Would you want to?  Well, he didn't specify.  Would you want a black mouth on that dick, Eric?  No, I'm good.  All right.  Thanks.  Oh, shit.  Jim Norton's in here.  You survived Peter Criss?  Everything went well?  Yeah, I did him for the boneyard tonight, too.  He was great, man.  What a nice guy.  He gave me a bunch of hugs.  Who kid was confused?  He was so nice.  I was confused because apparently, at one point, this is what who kid picked up on on the  interview.  He was listening.  Where's my camera?  I thought it was a wallet.  I didn't know that.  I'm sorry.  He had it in his pocket.  He was trying to take it. 
[04:03:30]  At one point, Peter said that he gyrated more towards Ace.  He meant gravitated.  Yes.  But who kid has been obsessed with the fact that he thinks gay acts were happening?  I tried to tell him.  It was a simple slip of the tongue.  They didn't even hear the word gyro.  I caught it.  I missed it.  I caught it.  But I will say this, and I won't even give it away, but I was not exaggerating when I  tell you that.  I'm going to tell who kid the teaser that you gave the audience at the end of the show. 
[04:04:00]  I mean, this book is apparently, I haven't read it, but apparently this Peter Criss book  is the most, and for Jim, Jim knows everything about Kiss, so for him to be reacting like this  and to be like, this book is beyond revealing, it's pretty amazing.  Even STD stuff is in the book?  There is some mention.  I don't think he's gotten it.  No, but he said other members had it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He said, here's the tease.  But they were lucky because back then.  There was no condoms.  Here's the tease.  Back then, the worst you'd get is maybe the clap. 
[04:04:30]  So Peter Criss.  You get a shot in the ass, pause.  Peter Criss was in bed with a girl and someone else.  What?  Male or female.  Peter Criss was getting his dick sucked under a blanket.  Hot.  And another person got into bed.  Public figure?  Yeah.  And Peter said he didn't know what was going on under those covers.  Yeah.  Which I think means that Peter possibly got a double blowjob, but can't say that for legal 
[04:05:00]  reasons because, again, you don't want somebody suing you.  Right.  Okay.  But when you read the book, you know who he's taunting him.  He says it.  He said it was a mayor?  No, no.  I'm not saying who it is.  By the book.  It literally was like a fucking shovel to my teeth.  Ed Koch?  To me, more surprising than Ed Koch.  Wow.  You were surprised by it.  I can't.  It's probably the most surprising sentence I've ever read in a book. 
[04:05:30]  Wow.  And I'm not overselling the book.  Peter left already.  Wow.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  Wow.  Like it's changed your, altered your perception?  No, no, no.  Not at all.  I mean, in a way, like, I was shocked to read it, but I know what my life has been like,  so nothing surprises him.  Yeah, he said a tranny sucked him off before.  Yeah, that's true.  Who hasn't been sucked off by a tranny?  That's like saying...  I, yeah.  To you, he kept his hand down.  My arm is hurting right now. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah, who could be his fucking rotor cuff?  I got the gay Spider-Man shit on my head.  Who could make his Howard Stern debut today?  Oh, how was it?  It was mad cool.  Good, good, good.  Some whack rappers was on there.  What's that?  I had to judge some whack rappers.  Oh, okay.  Buddy told us that he saved...  He doesn't reveal any secrets on Howard.  All the good information.  It was very generic up there.  Oh, okay.  I could bring all the gay shit over here.  Real quick.  Before you leave, Hookie, because we only got a minute left.  Yeah, that really is an odd get-up you have on your head there.  It's like the nigga Spider-Man.  You look like the fucking... 
[04:06:30]  You look like the dude from True Blood.  Lafayette?  Yeah, Lafayette.  Where the eyes at, son?  Yo, do you have that on backwards?  Listen, Hookie, I need you to hear this.  This is a jingle that somebody sent in for E-Rock,  and people have been asking me to play it for you.  Feet up on the floor like I run the show.  Hookie in my mouth.  Hookie in my mouth.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  E-Rock.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  E-Rock.  That's hot.  E-Rock.  Fat boy in the seat. 
[04:07:00]  Bikini girls on the street.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  What do you think of that?  Okay, Coke floats in my cup.  That's one of the hottest shits I ever heard.  E-Rock Army.  Ooh, that shit is crazy, son.  Yeah.  It's called E-Rock Army, nigga, by, uh.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  George Huckus.  That's hot.  I need that in my eye.  You like that?  What?  Reeve, you think that would get a couple spins at Shade 45?  You might have to put them on, like, a Hated or Lover kind of thing.  Okay.  Okay, so you get the pulse of the Shade 45 audience. 
[04:07:30]  Of the Shade listeners.  I understand.  I want to put this mask on, Jim, man.  Jim Noring, congratulations on a wonderful day for you.  Yes, it was a lot of fun.  It's very gyrating.  Also, by the way, let's not overshadow the Big Show, who was into it.  Big Show was great, and so was DL.  DL is always great.  DL is a brilliant comic, man.  He's really a fucking funny dude.  Every time he comes on, he's got topical stuff.  He's got a really smart angle.  He's a great comic.  He's great.  And who could show?  Obviously, Saturdays on Shade 45. 
[04:08:00]  Oh, and this weekend's the Halloween.  This weekend's the special Halloween.  Bad joke.  Oh, yeah, I got it.  Halloween show.  Yeah, I got it.  All right.  Hooloween.  We got to make room for Ron and Fez.  Thank you all for being here.  Hey, Fez.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  To my cup, E-Rock Army, nigga.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
