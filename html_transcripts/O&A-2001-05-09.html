<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between shocking listener calls, celebrity interviews, and bizarre tangents.  The show opened with Drew Boogie's remixes and Mad Money Steve's guitar work being acknowledged, immediately followed by a call from Jennifer describing witnessing a 50-year-old man engaged in sexual acts with a teenage boy. This sparked a heated and explicit discussion among the hosts and callers, delving into homosexuality, age of consent, and varied reactions to the graphic details.  Jane called in stating she found the scenario arousing, and Michelle shared a story about witnessing oral sex on a train.  The discussion continued with further explicit caller anecdotes and opinions on gay sex, featuring Gay Marco, a recurring guest, who refuted a news article claiming highly motivated gay men could become straight. A listener proposed the "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge," leading to a rules discussion. The segment concluded with promotion of a WOW sticker giveaway by Earl in Yonkers, a Bellevue special, and the playing of a song written by one of the hosts about a drunken night.

The hosts then discussed a recent hospital visit, expressing their dislike for the facility and their penchant for making offensive jokes in public. Upcoming appearances by Johnny from the Jerky Boys, Otto and George were announced; Otto revealed plans for a new, enhanced George puppet and a Bobby Kennedy dummy.  Kate called requesting the hosts support the Toronto Maple Leafs in game seven. The “WOW sticker extravaganza” road trip was detailed, with the full itinerary available online. The whipped cream bikini contest update followed, with eight contestants remaining.  A call from Lou (Switzerland) detailed finding two midgets engaging in sexual activity in a dumpster behind a gay bar. Paul suggested a "Deadhead" style caravan for the WOW road trip, mentioning seeing Blues Traveler.  Jennifer called again, briefly recounting a disturbing encounter before claiming a phone malfunction cut her short.  Otto and George then arrived in the studio.

Otto and George promoted their upcoming show with Jim Norton and Rich Voss, with Otto adding an AR-15 to his "terrorizing" activities and promoting George Martin's restaurant. A female caller was subjected to teasing and harassment. The hosts debated FCC restrictions on language, contrasting them with TV violence.  Otto and George bickered about the new puppet and its cost, joined by Joe Piccoli discussing his circumcision. The conversation turned to Action Park, with numerous callers sharing injury stories, including one caller recounting being stabbed while performing with Otto and George's puppets.  Otto and George's Rascals show was promoted again. The hosts compared their demanding schedule to a 9-to-5 job, returning to Action Park's dangers, specifically a water slide known for causing wedgies and enemas.  A call from Vinny from *The Sopranos* followed, discussing his role, a movie with Elizabeth Hurley, and making off-the-cuff remarks about the show. The segment concluded with a Vermont Teddy Bear Company advertisement.


The next segment started with Vinny Passori discussing his film career, including *Under Hellgate Bridge*, and mentioning bringing Jennifer to New York, using vulgar language and sexual innuendo. He also addressed rumors about Dominic Chianese ("Uncle Junior").  Johnny from the Jerky Boys then called, discussing his career, new tape (*The Jerky Tapes*), and his falling out with Kamal. The hosts teased Johnny relentlessly, reminiscing about past interactions and Kamal's rudeness. They detailed their prank calls and creative process, with Otto, George, Joe, and Drew Boogie present in the studio.  Further listener calls and Action Park injury stories followed, including vulgar language and descriptions of dangerous incidents.  Discussions about other radio personalities and a BMW Films commercial were included. The segment ended with banter amongst the hosts and guests.


The final segment began with a ProFlowers.com advertisement, during which Opie expressed intense dislike for Kamal.  The hosts then discussed a "Terror in the Tub" news teaser about a dangerous bath seat, criticizing its lack of specifics. This led to a discussion about sensationalized news teases, including one about E. coli-contaminated lettuce.  The conversation shifted to a "feeder" fetish, with callers expressing varying reactions and sharing related anecdotes.  A Mujan hair removal product advertisement was revisited, with sound effects and humorous commentary from the hosts and Otto and George.  The "Stadium Auto Mall" advertisement with its unusual payment plan was also discussed.  The segment concluded with more phone calls, listener comments, and promotion of Otto and George's show with Jim Norton and Rich Voss.  Drew Boogie's presence in the studio was noted.

Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  So surreal.  Please pull your request.  Oh, dear.  It's Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  It's Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Huh?  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony.  W.A.W.  What is up?  Crumpet Muncher.  What is up?  Crumpet Muncher.  I hate this place.  I love this place on Wednesday.  Yes.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  It's Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Gotta love it.  Gotta love it.  I'm seeing the wows all over the place today. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Get them on your vehicle.  First off, I want to thank Drew Boogie for those fine remixes at the beginning of the show there.  Yeah, we were listening to a few of his new ones in the office.  Always, always a pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  God damn genius.  A whole lot of fun.  A whole lot of fun.  Yeah, they're amazing.  They really are.  We got a bunch of new ones we're going to throw into the show today.  Gotta credit Mad Money Steve, Steve, for strumming very nicely on there.  You're calling him Mad Money Steve now? 
[00:02:00]  Well, he could play guitar and I can't, so.  Yeah, Steve's doing a lot of the riffs in the Drew Boogie remakes now.  Oh, it comes out much better that way.  It works.  Big time.  Big time.  Nice.  Thanks for that.  Greatly appreciate it.  Yes.  And we've got to quickly go to Jennifer because she's got a story.  You know what?  I don't believe it, but let's go with it and see what happens.  Jennifer, what's going on?  Hey, Opie and Anthony, you'll never believe what I just saw.  That's what we just said.  We'll never believe it, but give it a try. 
[00:02:30]  I know you're not going to believe this.  I live on the beach here in Bradley.  Yeah?  I'm still in shock.  I'm still in shock.  I don't know how to talk.  What happened?  Oh, there's this guy that lives in the front apartment of mine down here.  All right?  Yeah.  His wife just left him because his wife thought that we were screwing around with each other.  It turns out I really don't even know the guy.  I always knew the guy was still out of breath.  All right.  Wait, wait.  So the wife thought that the husband was screwing around with you. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't even call a friend.  I had to call you guys first.  And he lives in the front apartment.  He lives in the front apartment all by himself, and I'm still shaking.  All right.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  All right.  For the past week now, I've been outside sunning, of course, you know, studying, doing whatever  I'm doing.  Every time I look over, I always notice that there's this teenage kid with him.  And I'm thinking to myself, we're all thinking to ourselves, all the neighbors and I, we're 
[00:03:30]  all thinking, all right, Tom's wife left him.  Now he's probably hanging out with his nephew.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Okay.  He's cleaning his apartment today.  And he left the part of his bedroom blind up, I guess, on accident.  And I walked by to go back into my house.  And he's doing the girl on the bed.  On the bed.  And he's right behind him.  He's doing him on the bed.  Oh, you're very naughty. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to call my neighbor over here, but she's on the phone.  I can't believe it.  Okay, listen.  Slow down, Debra.  Oh, my God.  I just want to go on record and say that I completely believe you.  Yeah, because now she's freaking out.  So you saw in his bedroom, he was with a teenage boy.  He looked like he was around 17 or 18 years old.  Oh, my God.  And how old's your neighbor?  They usually hang out with the guy, Tom. 
[00:04:30]  He's in his 50s.  He's a Vietnam vet.  But I think the war got to him a little bit.  But, oh, my God.  I'm still shaking.  So he was behind this 17 or 18-year-old.  He looks like I found out.  He goes to AA meetings over in Belmont.  I found out that he's really gay.  And I'm thinking, what's he doing hanging out with Tom?  So he was tooling this guy?  Because I always knew Tom was great, huh?  So he's tooling this teen boy in his bed?  He must have.  Every time I see him outside Sunday when I'm out here, I always see those two.  And they're always hanging around with each other for the past two weeks. 
[00:05:00]  And I thought maybe it was his nephew.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So you were walking across the street from the boardwalk.  I live right across the street from the beach.  And he had his vacuum going right before I, like, right after I left the house to go suntan and stuff, I was, I heard him.  I heard him, like, the vacuum going and everything.  And as I came back, I guess he was cleaning his blinds and just forgot to push down part of the blind.  And I just heard, like, noise. 
[00:05:30]  And I'm like, no, no, this can't be us.  It sounded like he was laughing.  But when I kind of, you can't, you can't walk by without seeing it.  The gap in the blind was just so wide.  And all you see is his butt going and his, oh, God.  See his butt going.  His, you know, his stomach going.  And the guy and the kids on all fours.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, slow down.  Buddy.  What a kid, Patrick.  You got yourself a pretty little faggot. 
[00:06:00]  All right, don't describe too much.  Guys, I've never seen anything like this.  You guys are, like, the first people I had to call for therapy on this because this is bad.  You know, Jennifer, we feel privileged.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you.  Wow.  All right.  Now, can anyone walk by this window and see this?  Well, I really don't want to find out.  I have to take the back alley to go to work.  He's taking the back alley right now in his bed with the guy. 
[00:06:30]  All I know is that's what's going on.  And I live three houses back.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  What do I do?  What do I do, call the police or call O.P. and Anthony?  Don't call the police.  I don't want this guy living in my house.  I do believe it's legal as long as the kid is of age.  Yeah.  What's wrong with the little butt sex?  Not when I'm around.  Not when I'm living.  See, our place is like a courtyard.  It's like a horseshoe. 
[00:07:00]  What's the problem with a little man-on-man anal?  You see, when he's like 55, he's going on 60, he's a young kid.  He's just like a young teenager.  So you're thinking that the kid's 17, 18, and he's in his 50s, right?  Yes.  That's what's going on.  Look at that.  My phone's conking out.  Oh, can you hear me?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  He's just like, what's the best?  Ah, teen, gay, anal.  He's singing him.  He's singing him.  Oh, God, my eyes have seen him.  All right.  How long ago did this occur? 
[00:07:30]  How long was?  How long ago did it?  This happened about 20 minutes ago.  Oh.  You got your cell phone?  No, I'm in my bedroom.  I got the door closed.  I'm on my regular, you know, cordless, and I just, oh, my God.  You're not hiding because of what you saw, are you?  It sounds like you might be in a closet or something.  Can you take the cell phone and maybe go by the window again and see what's going on?  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Well, I'm kind of, like, in nude right now.  I haven't been able to get dressed.  Oh, you were feeling a little... 
[00:08:00]  I just got out of the shower.  I thought maybe a shower would, like, cool me off from what I thought, and then I'm just  standing here like, oh, my God.  What a better way to start the show than gay, sex, and a round of What's in My Pants?  What a way to start my day.  I have to go to work.  Would you like to play What's in My Pants?  I want to play that with you guys all the time, but Stinky never...  Well, he puts me on hold, but you guys never pick up the phone.  You're naked right now, and you got your phone.  That's all you need.  I got my towel wrapped around me, and I have to get dressed and go to work, but I'm so afraid  to walk outside. 
[00:08:30]  No, come on.  It'll take two seconds.  Drop the towel.  Really, I am going to be late, though, but I'm like, oh, my God.  We are so ready to play What's in My Pants.  I know.  You got a song in every stop.  I don't know.  I'm so sorry, but I'm telling you, the guys that work, I've never seen...  Don't put it back.  And, you know, I'm in the medical field, and I've seen people...  All right.  Hold on.  I mean, you know it.  Jennifer, they're going to dump out of all that.  Sorry.  Basically, you've seen...  I'm shaking, guys.  You've seen stuff in the back door.  Guys, I'm shaking. 
[00:09:00]  I just...  I am just so...  Oh, my God.  So you don't want to play What's in My Pants?  Can I call back tomorrow after I stop shaking?  All right.  We should give you something for that fine story.  What am I going to do?  How do I even go on living in this place knowing that this is what's going on?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm a sex addict, but I'm not that crazy to stand there and just deal with that.  Hello?  Hello? 
[00:09:30]  I'm complaining about you looking in my window.  Don't make me send my nephew Tony over there.  Hey, you know what I feel like doing?  If Uncle Junior wants to have some fun, why can't he have some fun?  What's wrong with a little butt sex?  And I've got to have this...  I've got to have this hole looking in my window.  That was me, and that was Jackie Jr.  I was keeping him out of trouble with that metal soprano.  Oh, I'm telling you.  He's going to get his ass kicked out of Jackie.  The ass is fine.  It's not like mine with the ass cancer.  You know who I wish they would really whack first? 
[00:10:00]  Not Pauly, but Rafi.  Oh, my God.  You look in my window.  I'm trying to have butt sex here.  Pauly, find this bitch.  Smack her out.  Listen, I'm going to walk by, and I'm going to yell,  You're a kid, don't you?  I'm going to get it.  Whoa, whoa.  Jennifer.  She just exploded.  Jennifer.  All right.  The gay guy just cut her phone line.  Tony.  Tony works fast. 
[00:10:30]  At least he works.  Not like this bullhorn.  What's wrong with this thing, Tony?  I was using it the other night.  Maybe it's clogged.  Gay Marco.  Oh, my God.  That story was so hot.  Yeah, I wanted to hear more detail.  I'm big dick butt.  You should have known.  Marco.  No, I was going crazy.  I love it.  That happened to me once.  I walked by and saw these two guys doing it.  What did you do at?  Oh, wait.  I was at the Babs.  The Babs.  Look, look. 
[00:11:00]  I understand, like, you gay guys got to get it on.  But that story's a little twisted.  The kid's, like, 17, 18.  The other guy's pushing 60.  It's still hot.  We have some audio of the young boy that was there.  Oh.  Eh, eh.  Ow.  I don't like it.  Thanks for giving us equal time.  Marco.  Marco.  Yes?  That was hot, huh?  Oh, it was really hot.  I want her to get more details.  We got the details. 
[00:11:30]  No, it was enough details.  The one guy was in pain.  Oh, when she was moaning?  I thought that was so hot.  When she was like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, because that's the sound gay guys make.  Oh, yeah.  Marco, while we have you on the phone, can we get your opinion on a story that was in the paper today?  Yes.  It says, gays going straight.  Did you read this today in the Daily News?  Marco?  Marco.  Yes?  Did you read that in the Daily News today?  What's the story?  Here it is.  A controversial new study by Columbia University professor claims highly motivated gays can become straight. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, please.  This story always pops up, this whole argument whether gays can go straight.  Now, Marco, I know you've had an experience, a guy on girl experience, right here in our own studio.  Yes, I did.  Where you ate the peach of a lovely young lady.  And did that in any way maybe give you an inkling that you might be able to go straight?  Impossible! 
[00:12:30]  Everyone has a catchphrase on this show.  I know, it's hysterical.  Can't you just answer the question?  He yells out his catchphrase.  You all got to clap like when they do it on SNL.  Catchphrase.  It's like SNL.  They all have their catchphrase.  And you applaud.  That'll be a true boogie remix now.  Stop playing to the cameras and stuff.  Impossible!  Impossible!  Wow.  That's a winner.  So basically, if you gay guys concentrate hard enough, you can become straight. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, sure.  We can do anything.  Well, that's what the paper's saying.  Yeah, but a year down the line, then he's at the bath.  Oh, you say it doesn't stick.  Oh, no.  It doesn't take.  Uh-uh.  It's not like double-sided cake, you know.  Can't estimate which...  This professor said he can't estimate which percentage, what percentage of homosexuals  can change their sexuality if they try...  I don't know, but the ice cream man is coming. 
[00:13:30]  Make your own joke there, man.  Fudge pack baby.  Fudge pack baby.  So what are you going to get, a push-up?  Oh, he's gone.  I missed him.  Damn.  Are you walking around the vet?  I'm outside my building at work.  Oh.  Gay Marco wants some soft serve in his face.  Yummy.  Marco.  Yes.  You were born gay, right?  Yes.  We went over there.  I was gay from the very first moment.  When did you...  I would play with dishes as a little child. 
[00:14:00]  I would wear my mother's high heels.  You're terminal gay, though.  Like, there's some gay guys maybe on the fence.  Yeah.  On the pole, whatever you want to say.  And they might be able to get turned.  Oh, sure.  But what they're saying is...  They'd always go back.  In this study, they say that they got these 200 ex-gays.  Ex-gays.  Yeah, please.  I'm an ex-gay.  I'm an ex-gay.  But they were referred to by religious groups that condemn homosexuality.  Which means, like, they're still effing gay. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  They're just trying to cover it up.  Well, basically, they scare the bejesus out of these poor guys.  They scare the Jesus into them.  They said, you know, you continue with this man-on-man thing, you're going to hell.  You're going to burn in hell.  What do you think about that, Marco?  Burning in hell.  I think it's fun.  All the butt-sucks you can have.  They'll just be hot in your hell.  It's going to be hot, nude chicks walking around...  You're right.  ...that just want to have sex from you. 
[00:15:00]  That's your personal hell.  With huge boobs.  Oh, God.  Paris the Thawne.  Imagine that.  He goes to hell, and that's his hell.  Would be any one of ours a heaven?  It'd be heaven.  And, of course, our hell is Marco there.  Hello!  Crisco!  Chasing you around with twice the junk he's packing already.  Oh, tuba lube.  And you have that dreamy, slow legs that you can't run.  And he's multiplied like a thousand times. 
[00:15:30]  A whole crowd of Marcos chasing you with junk all ready to go.  Oh, man.  And you're just like, no!  Before you know it, you're on the ground.  And that's hell.  All right, Marco.  We'll let you go.  All right.  Read my column, findthemusic.com.  We'll do that.  You got a new one?  I have one every week.  Oh, great.  We'll read it, okay?  Okay.  All right, Marco.  I'm sure this one's a man.  He was a Navy SEAL.  Always a pleasure, Marco.  Bye. 
[00:16:00]  Anthony, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Earl's at another sticker stop.  He's at one already?  Yeah.  Earl.  Yo!  Didn't you just leave for this sticker stop?  Yeah.  We got it pretty quick.  Okay.  Yeah, we were in the...  How do I top those two stories?  Brooklyn.  Where are you, Earl?  We are at the Cross County Center Shopping...  Cross County Shopping Mall, I'm sorry, which is right up of Route 87.  And we're right in between Stearns and the Stop and Shop here in Yonkers.  Oh, my God.  I was waiting for a state.  Thank you for staying in Yonkers. 
[00:16:30]  I was waiting for a state.  I love that guy.  State Town Wire.  87's a small road.  Yeah.  Sure.  All right, so you're there handing out the WOW stickers for the next, what, five minutes?  We'll be here for at least an hour while supplies last.  At least an hour.  All right.  Very good, Earl.  Don't go out of your way.  Give that location one more time in Yonkers, off 87.  We are at the Cross County Center, which is right up at Route 87.  And we're right in between the Stearns and the Stop and Shop. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Cool, Earl.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, guys.  We'll check in with you in a little bit.  All righty.  There goes, Earl.  We're going to be handing out about 100,000 WOW stickers this Friday.  We'll have details in just a bit.  Yeah, she's got to stay on hold.  Yeah, make sure she doesn't go anywhere.  Make sure Karen doesn't go anywhere.  Yeah, exactly.  But she's got something really good for the show.  Matt, real fast.  This is Isolation City.  What?  Hello.  We're losing you.  Matt?  It's Isolation City. 
[00:17:30]  All right, Matt.  One more try.  Go.  All right.  We lost him.  What the hell was that?  All right.  What?  What?  You said, what a way to start the show is what do you want to say?  Man on man, Amy.  Yeah, I know.  You know something?  A lot of people give me grief on instant feedback about, oh, isolate that clip.  I don't care.  I think it's funny.  It's true.  I'll give you some more stuff to work with.  There you go.  Quick break, and we'll go to the phones next.  A lot of great stuff on the phones, and we can't do it.  A girl wants to do the Wiffle Ball Bad Challenge.  We've got a 50-foot high WOW sign somewhere out there and lots of things. 
[00:18:00]  So stay there.  This is a song that I wrote, actually, a couple days ago after, excuse me, a friend of mine,  my best friend, we went out to a bar, and we got really hammered.  We just had a really good time, and I realized, you know, why not write a song about the good  times that you have with your pal when you're out drinking at night?  You know what I mean?  Sure.  And so I wrote this for my best friend, my friend.  This should be cute.  I'm going to play that now.  Touch it.  I hope he's listening.  If you are, man, this one's for you. 
[00:18:30]  Here we are, dear old friend, you and I, drunk again, laughs have been had, tears have  been shed, maybe the whiskey's gone to my hand. 
[00:19:00]  But if I were gay, I would give you my heart.  And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art.  And if I were gay, we would swim in romance.  But I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants.  It's not that I don't care, I do. 
[00:19:30]  I just don't see myself in you.  Another time, another scene, I'd be right behind you, if you know what I mean.  Cause if I were gay, I would give you my soul.  And if I were gay, I would give you my whole being.  And if I were gay, we would tear down the walls.  But I'm not gay, so won't you stop cupping my hand. 
[00:20:00]  It's radio.  We've never hugged, we've never kissed, I've never been intimate with your fist, but you  have opened brand new doors.  Get over here and drop your dress.  All the news you need to know, and boom.

Gentlemen, sir, you're wacky. 
[00:22:30]  Are you matching me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, I just make blue tangles.  It's the O&H Show.  212-757-1027.  Yeah.  Nice.  Caliva, your disease.  Caliva.  We have a lot of ladies calling in that want to comment about that first call of the show today, Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  Yes.  You're just tuning in.  You missed some unbelievable stuff.  Yes, she was walking home, I guess, and one of her neighbors, whose wife just recently left him, left his blinds open a little bit.  She kind of passed by the bedroom and looks in and sees this guy, like a 50-year-old neighbor of hers, behind a teenage friend of his, another guy, doing the nasty. 
[00:23:30]  Doing the nasty.  Doing the ugly, stinky sex.  Doing that smelly sex, you know.  The sex that stinks.  In more ways than one.  Right.  Yeah, well.  And she was horrified, wasn't she, Anthony?  Yeah.  She was beside herself, wasn't she?  Like an oil derrick.  She could barely get the story out.  She was so disturbed, right?  Yeah, she was disturbed.  Disturbed, disgusted.  Shocked.  Shocked.  I think she was calling from her closet.  She was in, like, the fetal position.  Yeah, she said she had to take a shower after she saw it. 
[00:24:00]  She was going to take the Glenn Close shower from the Big Chill to wash off the grime and dirt.  It's not like she was in there.  Yeah, but, you know, she was horrified about what she saw.  I guess so.  It felt dirty.  Yeah.  Well, let's go to the other side of the spectrum and talk to Jane.  Jane, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  All right, that woman gave up the best opportunity of her life.  Why?  She should have stayed there and, like, got off to it or went and joined in or something.  I don't know about that. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, she should have.  I mean, she must be sheltered her whole life or something.  Jane, how old are you?  Seventeen.  Yeah.  And basically what you want to say is that you would have got off on that?  Yeah, like Queer as Folk or something.  I watch that show, like, every Sunday.  You watch Queer as Folk and you find it hot.  Oh, that is a bad show.  And you like the man-on-man sex.  Yeah, and then every once in a while you see the lesbians run around and that's cool, too.  And then you get back to the men.  It's great.  So you're into watching gay guys go at it? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, it's awesome.  I don't know why women are so disgusted by it.  It's just like men get turned on by women on women.  I truly believe it's a double standard.  Like, two ladies going at it?  Yeah.  Hot.  You can't find too many women that'll admit two guys going at it.  No.  Hot.  I know you're out there.  You don't...  I mean, you can call it the law.  I'm sure there's plenty.  Sure.  But most guys, you're not going to get in an argument.  Two girls going at it really, really hot.  Two guys.  You pull the ladies, two guys.  You're not going to...  Yeah.  The percentages aren't going to be as high. 
[00:25:30]  So have you ever seen that happening live?  It's like in the city and stuff, but nothing...  What do you mean?  Oh, you haven't seen sex.  It's like in the West Village, the kids here and there, but nothing...  You haven't seen the hardcore gay action.  No.  It sucks, man.  Yes, it does.  But there's women out there.  They're definitely into it.  They just don't want to admit it.  So that story turned you on is what you're saying.  It turned me on.  Except the fact that the guy was 50, but...  Well, 50 and like 18.  Yeah, but still, that's exactly queer as folk.  But queer as folk does that? 
[00:26:00]  There's a kid that was like 17 getting it on with that like 30-year-old or something.  Yeah, but that's still 30-17, not 50-17.  I bet even with the 50-year-old guy behind, I bet his yam bag was lower than the younger guy.  Probably because they live in this sheltered neighborhood.  This woman was freaking out.  The guy, the 18-year-old, probably can't find anyone his own age.  The young guy's sitting there going, what's hitting me in the chest?  Oh, it's your yam bag.  Jeez, melted Turkish tapioe on a hot summer day. 
[00:26:30]  Talking all the way around.  Nice.  It's on his heels.  Nice.  All right, Jay.  All right, guys.  Well, thank you for that.  Okay?  All right.  There's a girl that gets off on that.  Seeing gay.  Gay sex.  None of that gay accent.  Michelle.  I already can link it together.  We might have to play that.  We haven't played that one in a while.  Michelle, how are you?  Good.  What's up, Lone?  You're on the radio, so keep the radio down, okay?  All right. 
[00:27:00]  That's all right.  All right.  I have a story that tops that chick that started the show off.  Let me just tell you.  You know how on the Long Island Railroad, how when you're sitting on a car, it's like there's  one road that's facing everybody?  One road?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I was in the road that was facing everybody.  And there was like some Chinese lady sitting next to me, and like two Chinese people sitting  in front of me, and everybody's facing me.  And I was looking in the back, and I'm seeing like, you know, one head. 
[00:27:30]  And I was ready to go, you know, to the back and like, you know, go sit next to that person  because I forgot I wanted to face the front, you know?  Uh-huh.  And I start walking back, and all of a sudden, I see the guy sit up.  And I was like, oh, right, there's two people sitting there.  So I go back and sit down.  About 10 minutes later, I turn back and I look around, and I see just one person, except  it's like the other guy that I didn't see before.  And then I was like, all right, that's weird.  I figure maybe he went to the bathroom and came back or something.  So I'm like waiting and waiting and waiting, and a couple minutes later, I see his head  come up. 
[00:28:00]  All right, and the next thing I know, I see him wiping off his mouth, and I was like,  oh, my God.  And I turn around, and these ladies that were sitting like on the aisle next to me, are hysterical  laughing.  Wow.  These girls are like hysterical laughing.  And they were like, oh, ladies, they're all calling up their husbands.  They're like, look what I'm looking at on the train.  I can't believe this is going on on the freaking train or whatever.  Oh, my God.  It was the funniest.  I could not believe it.  I was flipping out.  So the guys...  The next thing you know, they start kissing each other.  Oh, wow. 
[00:28:30]  And then my friend said that one of them got off, and she saw a wedding ring on their  finger.  What do you mean by got off?  Got off the train.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, like afterwards.  Yeah, yeah.  After I left, she was still on the train, and she saw one of them leave the train.  And he had the wedding ring on, and the other guy stayed on the train.  Look at that.  Guys taking care of each other on the way home on the Long Island Railroad.  Hey, there you go.  Yeah, it's like some kind of radar or something, like they picked it up. 
[00:29:00]  All right, Michelle.  Good story.  All right.  Bye, O&A.  Thank you.  Doc.  This girl, Becky, checking in from London, Opie.  Yeah?  Syndication Underground.  I would totally have stood and watched through the window and gotten off.  Ain't nothing better than one Jimmy is definitely two Jimmys.  No.  She's even typing with an accent.  From Syndication Underground.  What the hell is a Jimmy?  I guess a guy or a fruit.  They can't call them fags because fags are cigarettes in England, Opie.  So maybe the Jimmy is the thing, though. 
[00:29:30]  Maybe the Jimmy is the thing.  I thought that was, what do they call it?  Twigs and berries.  Twigs and berries.  Thank you, Austin.  Twigs and berries.  Maybe she can write us back.  A little how's your father.  Give the undercarriage.  The undercarriage.  Maybe she can write us back.  Yeah.  I would say Jimmy is the junk.  Junk?  Sure.  Jimmy is junk here.  Jimmy is what?  Yeah, because Jimmy hat.  Yeah, the whole Jimmy hat thing. 
[00:30:00]  Jimmy is junk here.  All right.  In London, it could mean gay Jimmy.  I don't know.  It's because, yeah, fag is a cigarette.  All right.  Now, here's Sharon.  Let me explain what Sharon's going to say here.  Yeah.  Hold on, Sharon.  Mm-hmm.  Well, go ahead.  Why don't you say it?  Well, you know, I thought watching Two Gay Guys would be hot.  You're so queer as folk.  The most aggravating show I've ever seen.  I don't know.  Well, I haven't seen this.  You have to.  Look.  You just have to. 
[00:30:30]  You know how you get disgusted by Oz?  Like you guys talk about having too much male camp on Oz?  Yes.  Yeah, this is aggravating.  This is like just watching Guys on Guys like the whole time.  All right.  So, Sharon, your fantasy was to see Two Guys.  You thought it would be a pretty hot thing to check out, right?  I think I was so queer as folk.  And I was like, no way.  And they're not really doing it on queer as folk, right?  Yeah, but they're like rubbing on top of each other naked and, you know, like, you want to do what you want to do.  What?  They really show all that?  They show Two Guys.  They show Two Guys.  Around here to go, yeah.  And the thing is, on Oz, like you look at them. 
[00:31:00]  I was waiting.  No takers.  Damn.  I know.  And the only one that was on to me was Ant.  The guys on Oz, you know they're not, you know, you know they're not gay.  So, it's kind of like hot.  But the guys on Queer as Folk, like, they're so gay.  Yeah.  It's just like two naked guys laying on top of each other, kissing, making out.  And it's like, you know.  So, that fantasy is no longer part of your repertoire, right?  That was down the first time I saw that show.  Right on.  All right.  Thank you, Sean. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  I think we can move on from the gay man sex.  You're not here.  You know how I'm gay.  Oh, turn that down.  Got it.  No.  Turn that down.  Turn your radio down.  Yeah.  Turn that down, guys.  Let's go.  All right.  We just built a big wild sign.  We built a hotel over on 1 and 9, quickly from the airport.  The wild sign itself, 100 feet up in the air, 50 feet wide, and about 12 feet high, and big orange letters.  You guys built this thing?  We built this thing.  We built it on the ground.  We picked up with a crane.  Nice.  We set it on the roof.  And where is it?  It's on 1 and 9, right across from the airport in Elizabeth. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, nice.  It's real nice.  Can you get a picture of it or something?  No, we can get one tomorrow.  All right.  Cool.  We'd love to see that.  Excellent.  We'll do that.  We'll have a picture.  We'll put it on the other side.  Thank you for helping us out with that.  No problem.  All right.  My pleasure.  Bye.  We'll have to ask all the girls that come in there.  Let's go to Hugh.  Hugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you just trying to get on the radio or is this a real story?  This is a real story.  All right.  Go ahead. 
[00:32:30]  Um, I was on the Long Island Railroad coming home, like drunk, like the last train, like  the 315 train or whatever the hell it is on the Babylon.  And, uh, there was this old lady who looked like she was out of the frigging far side or  something, man, with the glasses and the big hair.  And there was like two old guys.  One guy looked like a biker.  The other guy looked like, I don't know, something like the kid out of Deliverance.  Like, wait, wait, wait.  Hugh, you can't say that. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Don't describe it.  It's funny, but you can't describe it.  Even if I use the correct terminology?  Basically, you can say that the two guys were double-teaming the lady, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  On the Long Island Railroad as you're coming home late at night.  Yeah.  Everybody was drunk fast out on the train, except like me.  I guess it ain't me, like, tying them from across the train. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  Like, yeah, it's quite a bit.  No, let's, like, do the deep.  All right.  Thank you, Hugh.  Your phone was crapping out there.  Amanda.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  What's up today, Amanda?  Well, I just wanted to tell you, I'm on 287 with my shirt off, heading towards Exit 9 River Road.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I just got a tingle.  It never gets old to hear.  So, you're wowing everyone on 287 near Exit 9?  Absolutely.  And you're driving topless right now?  Absolutely.  I just want everybody to know to go there, because I'm wowing everybody. 
[00:34:00]  To go, what, to Exit 9?  Exit 9.  On 287.  287.  Hopefully, I won't get stopped by the cops.  No, well.  No, they love it.  Most of them love it.  Most of them love it.  Do you have a nice set?  Oh, absolutely.  38B.  Okay.  Sure.  Good.  Good.  Something didn't match up there, but that's okay.  Oh, she hung up.  Liar.  Call back.  You're reading it.  Call back.  All right.  Finally, we can get to Karen. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Karen.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi, Karen.  How are you?  What's wrong?  Huh?  What's wrong?  Nothing's wrong.  I'm at work.  Oh, so you've got to keep it on the QT.  Yeah.  Okay.  Where do you work?  I'm at an outside.  In the city?  No, I work in Teaneck, New Jersey.  All right.  Teaneck.  Very nice.  Nice to have you.  What's your proposal?  I heard you guys mention the NSYNC tickets yesterday.  Do you have a daughter?  Sure.  If you want me to. 
[00:35:00]  No.  You want to go to NSYNC?  Yes.  How old are you?  27.  And you're really into NSYNC?  I love NSYNC.  Are you?  Don't take this as an insult, because I consider myself immature.  Are you immature for your age?  You know what?  All my friends kind of think I'm a little weird for being so in love with Justin.  You're in love with Justin.  Oh, yes, I am.  More so than Gay Marco is in love with JC. 
[00:35:30]  She's in love with Justin.  Are you hot and stuff?  What?  Are you hot?  Yeah.  What do you...  Describe yourself a little bit.  What a waste.  I'm at work.  Well, just give a quick little description.  5'10".  All right.  You're going to crush the poor kid.  You're tall.  Okay.  5'10".  I have long hair.  How much do you weigh?  I'm kind of chunky, but I have a nice figure.  Well, what's 5'10"? 
[00:36:00]  You're tall, so how much do you weigh?  What'd you say?  Ballpark.  I'm not that way.  Just name a ballpark.  You weigh as much as.  Yeah.  There you go.  No.  Anthony, we like our fat listeners, too.  I know.  I'm sorry.  How much do you weigh?  I would guess 190, sure.  Okay.  You're 190?  Well, you're 5'10".  Yeah.  She would fess up to 190.  That means it's a little higher than that.  How many? 
[00:36:30]  Well, 30.  I can't say.  How big are the boobs?  How big are the boobs?  38, triple D.  38, triple D.  All right.  There's a lot of weight dedicated to the boobs here.  Well, you know, I don't know, guys.  38?  I don't have a problem getting men.  Let me tell you something.  Never a problem.  I don't know if that matters, but.  38 is not that big.  As far as, you know, your overall size.  Right.  The triple D is nice.  That means you have huge boobs.  38 is the back thing, and 38, not bad.  Right.  When you start getting into the 40s, it gets a little bit bigger. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  No, not bad.  Okay.  So what do you do, like, socially?  You go out a lot?  I mean, somebody who's into it.  You know, I also like, you know, regular bands, like Creed and whatever, but I don't  know.  I just love.  Do you have any posters in your bedroom?  Oh, you should see my desk at work.  Your desk at work?  You have in-sync pictures?  Oh, yeah.  And how?  Mostly 90% dedicated to Justin.  And does everyone just make fun of you?  Oh, yeah.  Especially since I work with women that are, like, 40, 50, 60. 
[00:37:30]  Okay.  So what do you want to do for the in-sync tickets?  Of course, next weekend, we're playing the fine game, Mommy.  What would you do for in-sync tickets?  Yeah.  Right.  We'll give details later on this week.  But, Karen, what?  I'm willing to do the Little Ball Bat Challenge.  What?  What?  Oh.  Rick's shaking his head.  I'm saying yes.  Hell, yeah.  I'm saying yes.  Hell, yeah.  Ben, you in for this?  No.  Ben's like, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:38:00]  Ben doesn't care.  He's trying to figure out what to play tomorrow on his show.  He's prepping for his show tomorrow.  Prepping for his two songs.  No, um, you know?  I'm bringing my friend Ray in to do the marking of the bat.  Ray?  Yeah.  No.  Stinky's sanctioned.  You got...  Okay.  Stinky, get Stinky in here.  He doesn't touch anyone.  Believe me.  No girl has ever been like, ah, Stinky, get the fist away.  Stinky.  Better known as Lube Boy.  Lube Boy, because he lubes up the bat. 
[00:38:30]  His nickname given to him by Nicky Sterling.  That's right.  Now, you know the, um, international porn star.  Stinky's funny, man.  He's come a long way, my friend.  Yeah, I heard that last week.  Yeah, well, uh, Lube Boy does the marking and everything else.  Right.  Now, do you think you have a shot at winning this?  Um, yeah, I have a shot.  Yeah, why not?  I think, you know what?  I'll make a bet with anyone right now.  What?  She will be our new champion.  You think?  Without a doubt.  Beating international porn star? 
[00:39:00]  Seeing that I'm so tall, I think that it's...  Go get the bat.  John, go get the bat.  She could use her weight to her advantage, maybe.  Or just the extra chubbiness around the area.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.  The pouch.  What?  What does that do?  Well, I'm just saying that could give you the extra quarter inch that might pick you over the top.  Ew.  Your hot pocket.  Right, but I think the fact that I'm so tall makes it, you know, like longer.  Do you have like...  That's what I'm thinking.  She's on the same wavelength as me. 
[00:39:30]  Taller girls, longer area.  Are we talking down there?  Is it tight like a little neck clam?  Or is it loose like a camel's lips?  No, it's not loose.  Because that's the difference between victory and defeat here in the Whiffle Ball Challenge.  Well, I'm willing to take the challenge.  If you guys are willing to let me take the challenge, I'm ready to take the challenge.  John, bring the Whiffle Ball Bet over here.  It's encased in glass.  It's in glass.  Waiting for the next performer to come in and do this. 
[00:40:00]  Whoa.  Ooh.  It's always covered with a condom, Opie.  So you don't have to bother with handling it and worrying.  But don't even put it near me.  I'm not too busy.  What end would you like to...  We have two records.  Yeah, I'm going to have to take a look at that thing.  You want to...  Probably a handle end.  We also have a new competition going up.  The six-inch PVC drain pipe challenge.  Would you want to know?  I don't think so. 
[00:40:30]  Look, it's only to there.  Yeah, well, that's the handle end.  But the big end, the victory end, is the other side, Opie.  Turn that around.  Now, look at the mark over there.  Well, that's just plain ridiculous.  She might be able to do it.  I think, where's the official mark on the other one?  On the other side?  Uh-oh.  No, it's there.  Right there.  You sure that's it?  Right above the end, yeah.  Okay.  Sterling did it for nothing.  This bitch is getting concert tickets.  Make her do it in the end. 
[00:41:00]  Only in sync tickets.  No.  Tom from T-Mac wrote that in.  Listen.  Listen.  If Ant will agree, if this girl could set the record,  I think we can get her a pair of instinct tickets.  Have you ever been with a black man?  In college.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, that right there, the odds just went, uh, she can accept all.  Yeah.  You know what?  Come on down.  Yeah.  You are cordially invited to come down for the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge. 
[00:41:30]  When can you get here?  Um, I can get there any time after, like, 4.30, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday next week.  Oh, I was hoping she'd say today.  How about today?  What the hell?  No, I can't today.  Why not?  Why?  Because I have to go.  I'm buying a house.  I'm going to look at houses in T-Mac.  Oh, yeah?  Actually, in Hackensack.  Hackensack.  All right.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, you come down next week, then.  Okay.  Hold on the line.  We'll give you some details.  Thank you.  You know, set the record.  You got the tickets.  Beautiful.  Definitely.  Scott, listening, Syndication Underground in Maryland, has a great idea. 
[00:42:00]  I don't even know if this has been done.  Rick, snap a goddamn picture of the Wiffle Ball Bat and put it up on the website.  Oh.  People, you know, we describe it in the glass case and stuff, and I think people think we're  lying.  Well, we also have great pictures of Nikki Sterling after she set the record that we can definitely  get up on the website.  Yeah.  For some reason, they're not up yet.  Yeah.  But get a picture of it in the glass case.  I think that'll be kind of interesting to watch.  Well, make sure you can see the markings and stuff.  Yes.  I think you should remark the bat.  It's fading a little bit. 
[00:42:30]  Put the nice, good marks.  All right, Karen.  Hold on, okay?  Okay.  Hold on.  We will get your information.  Thanks.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There she goes.  That's great.  Now we know she's around 250 if she dated black guys.  Ryan from Jersey.  That's right.  The brothers love the white girls, but they love the chunky ones.  I don't know what that is.  I say when you're going down the street and you see a white chick with a black guy, it's  always the same white broad. 
[00:43:00]  It's like the hair that's had a little too much processing done to it, the bleach.  It's all frizzy.  You got the big ass 80s makeup and 80s like frizz hair.  Anthony, why are you looking at Drew Boogie as you say this?  I'm looking at Rick.  Oh, okay.  Why?  I tell you what.  What?  All that hair, all the rest of the stuff doesn't matter.  All that matters is the ass.  The ass?  That's all that matters.  That's the money shot.  She's got to have meat on her.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got to have meat.  That's what I've noticed.  I'll tell you the truth.  I'm Jamaican.  Yeah.  And most of the Jamaican guys I know and relatives and whatnot like the nice women with meat. 
[00:43:30]  You got to have stuff to grab.  You know, these little white girls, you know, you got to have stuff to grab.  And the size of the Jamaican guy, you know, Jamaican Mike and stuff, let's just say you  need a bigger garage if you're going to be parking a caddy in there than you would if  you had, like, a neon.  Ah, but then there's the ripple fetish.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You like watching the...  Yes, I like watching them flow.  You know me, I'm little, so I can't have anything too big. 
[00:44:00]  I can't have anything that's going to crush my pelvis.  But something that is, you know, has just enough meat on it to make some nice action to  look at.  They've got terminology for everything.  Yeah.  Watch it flow.  The wiggle and jiggle.  The wiggle and jiggle.  Like Jell-O.  Big ass of Jell-O.  Don't you guys ever watch the BET shows, the videos with all the big girls with big  asses that are just flapping all over the place?  I'm afraid of the BET channel.  I'm afraid.  No, I've turned it on occasionally. 
[00:44:30]  The best thing is the Brooklyn cable channel that they have.  It's a local cable access thing.  And it is, on weekends, they take cameras into the clubs cursing everything.  I mean, nudity, and it just looks like a riot going on in some of these clubs.  Just drunk guys putting their face in the camera.  Yo, I won't give a shit out of my podcast.  I love that guy.  He's New York in the house.  I'm like, ah!  I changed the channel. 
[00:45:00]  Because it's in my house.  I've got to get out of it.  I ran out of my house one day.  I called the cops.  Said, I got the Brooklyn cable channel on.  I'm afraid to go back in and hit the remote.  And hit back.  I've seen some of that stuff.  I'm afraid to go to those clubs.  Isn't that amazing?  Like, they take cameras into the clubs.  Yeah, and just, it's debauchery.  It's just ass-grabbing.  Girls hanging their cans out.  You just picture, like, the scene from Animal House.  Hey!  You know, they walk in, and all of a sudden, everything goes quiet. 
[00:45:30]  We are going to die.  We are going to die.  All right, we're in the world.  We've got to check in with Earl here.  Earl's doing a WoW sticker shop today in Yonkers.  Earl.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's Yonkers?  It's going great.  Everyone's saying that you never come up here, and it's great to see us up here.  And we're having a great time.  Are you still on 87, or do you want to call it the D again this time around?  Well, we are in between Sir's and the Stop and Shop right at the Krupp County Center.  Can you pick another department store? 
[00:46:00]  It's the biggest one here.  All right, just wondering.  Oh, sorry, guys.  Is that one going out of business, too?  All right, so where's your exact location, Earl?  We're literally right off the exit, which is right off of 87.  Okay.  First exit to the Stop and Shop.  Earl, are you listening to yourself?  He is the best.  Are you awake, Earl?  I'm quite awake. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  You cranking out the show for everyone?  You know, Ben, he could easily be doing this.  Wait, is that another threat to Clint?  Another threat to Clint?  Like, he's laughing his ass off.  What's your problem with Ben?  I don't even think you said anything today.  You're laughing out.  I'm tackling in the background.  Well, that's nice.  I just want to know if you were awake.  A guy called in and said you were at the L.A. Guns show asleep out front.  Oh, no.  Were you asleep?  No, I was not. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Earl's doing a fine job today.  It's a great day.  He is.  Rip him out Wednesday.  He's handing out the WoW Snickers somewhere in Yonkers off the 287.  Right?  No, right off the 87.  Oh, 87.  87.  87, which is the Deegan, right?  Yes.  Go see Earl.  He'll give you a box of stickers and then leave.  Aw, Earl was in a good mood today.  Earl?  I know.  Earl, I appreciate you today.  So do I.  Well, we're having fun here, guys.  All right.  Good.  Have fun, all right? 
[00:47:30]  That's all that matters.  Yeah, we'll be in until about 4.30, handing out WoW stickers.  And everyone that's in the area, come on down.  All right.  Thank you.  There you go.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Many of the best.  We have to take a break.  We love Earl.  We're going to be talking to, what, Big Pussy next, right?  Big Pussy.  Nice.  Yeah, why don't we do some new Drew Boogie to drop some fine remixes off the strap in.  Here's another one.  Everybody talking about the FBN Anthony Show. 
[00:48:00]  I know I'm a loser.  You're a jerk-off.  Hey, douche.  You effing tall.  I'm a fool.  Thanks for me.  I'm a dumb flot.  I'm a fool.  Okay, pathetic.  Thanks for me.  Someone just shoot me in the head.  Hey!  Hey!  Back to you. 
[00:48:30]  Back to you.  Okay.  Hey, everyone.  It's your good pal Phil McCracken.  Boy, I got a rock-hard one here at my desk.  Because I'm tiddling myself. 
[00:49:00]  You're a rick, kid.  Touch it.  I'll bag anything with a hole.  By Opie and Anthony.  Hey, let's go touch some children.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you.  Thank you.  1027 WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Proofing New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  Now, this is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Man, I can't wait for the new STP, Ant. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Lots going on today.  A program note, Ant?  Yes.  Thank you, John, from Rybrook.  It's back.  Bellevue tonight at 11 after the Sopranos repeat.  Oh!  We were talking about the Bellevue special.  It's a must-see.  And now you can tune in and know exactly what we were talking about when you heard this.  I hate this place.  Meditations don't work.  Nothing works here. 
[00:50:00]  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  We have Big Pussy calling us any moment now, Anthony.  You know what, quickly, you know what I was doing?  The day after we saw that special, I went into my mom and he's hospital over there in Brooklyn.  Congratulations, Buddy and Jennifer.  New parents.  Nice.  The little boys.  And I'm walking through the halls of the hospital chanting that.  It sounds great with the echo of the hospital hallway. 
[00:50:30]  I swear, I was walking down the hospital hallway saying that.  We do it outside the building all the time when we go for lunch.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Medication doesn't work.  Nothing works here.  We'll get some looks on the streets of New York, believe it or not.  Yeah.  From people that have heard it all, too.  All right.  So that's going on.  Also, yeah, we got Johnny from the Jerky Boys calling us today.  And Otto.  Otto's outside.  Yes.  Otto and George are coming in in just a few minutes here. 
[00:51:00]  I'm a little disappointed.  Why?  Because I thought he'd have the new George with him, but he's still under construction.  That's right.  Last week we talked to Otto, he was getting a new George done.  Getting a new George and going to retire the old George.  But I hear the new George is going to have some new features and stuff.  I guess we'll find out what they are.  And he said he wants to get a Bobby Kennedy dummy.  Not that anyone cares, just for his own fun.  Imagine him at home working a Bobby Kennedy dummy.  What the hell is he going to do with a Bobby Kennedy doll? 
[00:51:30]  Use the accent.  And I'm banging hoas.  We'll have to ask.  Kate from Jersey.  Opie, I'm a big Devils fan.  So, knowing your luck with sports, can you please, please, please say you hope Toronto wins tonight?  Yeah.  Game seven.  Go Toronto.  Oh, there you go, Opie.  Go Toronto.  I do have the worst luck.  You've got to really mean it, though.  Yeah, I love the Maple Leafs.  Oh, jeez.  No, you don't. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, no.  This is backfiring, right?  Kate, you ruined it.  Seems like a lot of people like how we say ruin.  Hey, you reen it.  Hey.  Shut up, you're going to reen it.  Shut up, you're going to reen it.  Anthony, we're doing our WOW sticker extravaganza Friday.  I don't even know what we're calling it, but basically, it's a road trip.  It's a WOW road trip.  We're going to be in a tour bus with a bunch of people from the show, and we're going to try to hand out 100,000 WOW stickers. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  All day.  We're going to be on the road, all over the area.  Now, they have come up with an itinerary for us, which is very, very long and confusing.  An itinerary.  So, it would be kind of stupid to just run down all the stops, so we're going to put this on www.com immediately, towndrymusic.com immediately.  So, if you're going to be close to any of these areas, please make sure you hang out and wait for us to come by with the WOW stickers and more fun. 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  Okay.  You never know what will happen when that bus stops.  But we're going to start right at the building, head down Broadway to City Hall, going to be in Brooklyn.  I just want to fast forward into the future a little bit and have people Monday calling us up going, I've got the best picture of you guys being arrested.  We're going to be at the Bean Post Bar in Brooklyn, matter of fact.  Oh, there you go.  Going to jump over the Verrazano Bridge into Staten Island. 
[00:53:30]  We're going to be at the Staten Island Paintball, Jersey City, Paramus, Yonkers, Flushing, New Hyde Park, and we've got specific places in all those places.  A quick Guinness stop.  A quick Guinness stop at the Bean Post.  Cool, man.  Why not?  Guinness on tap there, Ben.  Nice.  Why not?  Billy Mack will be there.  Billy Mack will be at every bar in Bay Ridge.  So, we'll have that on the website so you can hopefully, you know, come see us, okay? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And really fast, Anthony, the other program note, our whipped cream bikini contest continues.  It's going quite well.  Oh, yeah.  Let me pop that up quickly.  We lost two more ladies today.  Who did we lose today?  Daisy and Chris, I believe, right?  Yeah.  They didn't get a, you know, they had the least amount of votes, so they're now out of the competition.  We're down to eight girls, Ant.  Yes, vote every day for your favorite girl.  And the girl with the least votes, or the couple of girls with the least votes, get eliminated. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, we're losing two girls every day.  And, Opie, you've been looking at the voting stats.  Very interesting.  What's your take on some of the numbers?  I don't want to give anything away.  No, without giving anything away, I could tell you this.  I could tell you there is a favorite.  There's definitely a favorite.  But how we vote, that could change.  That changes because the people that were voting for the girls that were eliminated are now going to have to find a new person to vote for. 
[00:55:00]  A new favorite, right.  So right now we do have a clear favorite, without a doubt.  I could say that.  Second place is a horse race, Anthony.  And it's...  Well, don't call him that, Opie.  Just say they're in second.  And it's been flip-flopping all day long.  It's been second and third place.  And fourth is pretty close as well.  Fourth place, close too.  Right now we have four girls that could win this contest.  Well, vote for your favorite girls.  Right.  I'm looking for...  And you've got to vote every day. 
[00:55:30]  WNAW.com, FoundryMusic.com.  How is this one going?  Which one?  Right there.  She's doing very well.  Very well?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, all right.  Very well.  All right.  Good.  Is that your fave?  Um, no.  No.  I think we all have the same favorite around here, huh?  I think we might.  That's never happened before.  Isn't that terrible?  Well, her pictures came out great.  I don't think we're giving anything away by saying that. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  You've just got to think, if you're a guy, you're at home, who have you spanked to the most?  There's your go-ahead winner, probably.  Grand prize, though, is a trip to Hawaii, so please vote every day, guys.  And girls.  A lot of girls are enjoying the contest as well.  Oh, yeah.  We'd like to hear that.  Yeah.  Let's go to Lou.  Lou, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Lou.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  I work for Waste Management.  Two weeks ago, I'm picking up this stop called Pieces on Bleecker Street, the gay bar. 
[00:56:30]  Me and my partner go in the back to pick up the six-yard container.  What do we see open the lid?  It's a two gay affin' midget affin' in a container.  You saw two gay guys going affin'?  I swear to affin' God.  Affin' God.  Well, I cannot say it.  Affin' God.  I apologize.  He did kind of spell it, but he says aff.  I think you missed the vowel.  He says F like aff.  He said aff-c-k.  No.  No, I'll put the U, O.P. 
[00:57:00]  You got the U in there?  Okay.  Aff.  Aff.  Where are you from?  Switzerland.  Switzerland?  Yes.  Big fan, guys.  Listened to you for three years.  And you're in Waste Management?  Yes, I am.  You're a Swiss mob we don't know about?  I don't know.  I thought the Guineas had that wrapped up.  Unfortunately, I did not.  Do you work for an Italian guy?  Well, Waste Management is all Italian, unfortunately.  Unfortunately?  Come on, we need to wet our beaks somewhere. 
[00:57:30]  If it ain't cement, it's Waste Management.  One more thing, guys.  I'm in the middle of my divorce right now.  Yeah.  I want to give a big ass to my soon-to-be ex-wife.  Yeah?  Yes.  Unfortunately, she signed the papers with no fight, Anthony.  Oh, she signed the papers?  She signed the papers last week.  Did your boss talk to her?  Excuse me?  Did your boss in Waste Management have a chat with her or something?  Something like that.  Great.  I don't doubt it.  So, getting back to the midgets, you go into this place, and where are they doing the deed? 
[00:58:00]  What is the container in the back of the restaurant?  What kind of container?  It's a six-yard container.  One of those are three by six.  Tony, I like the Swiss guy.  Tony, the Swiss guy's cute.  Get him for me before I die of ass cancer.  You've got to do that for big questions.  Anyway, if my partner goes back and pick up the container, you know, about two feet high,  three by six, we open the lid.  There's two midgets, Anthony.  It sounds like, wait a minute, Peter, do you see what I see?  They jump out of the container and start running on Bleecker Street with their pants down their ankles. 
[00:58:30]  Two midgets.  No, midgets can't run with pants down their ankles.  What do you know I'm talking about?  Those little freaking feet?  Big helmet?  Those little tiny arms?  I think you're pulling our legs.  I'm not.  What a coincidence that the container that you have to pick up, you open it up and there's  two midgets midgets.  I guess I was blessed, Opie.  Huh?  I guess I was blessed.  You were blessed to see something?  Yes, I was.  It was a pretty boring night.  Affing midgets.  Affing midgets on Bleecker or off Bleecker.  Pieces. 
[00:59:00]  That's the name of the bar.  It's a gay bar on 7th Avenue South on Bleecker.  Ben's nodding his head like he knows this.  Oh, Ben.  There's a regular spot that we pick up the containers from.  Ben knows this place?  Have you seen gay midgets walking into this place on the way home?  No.  From work?  No?  All right.  Well, Lou, thank you.  It's been a pleasure.  Thank you, buddy.  Our Swiss mob guy.  Yeah.  212-757-1027.  Paul, what's up?  How you doing, man?  Hey.  I want to know a couple things.  First of all, for the road show, the tour you're doing, can we get to get people like 
[00:59:30]  O&A heads?  We can follow you around from town to town with yourself veggie burritos.  We can get people walking around looking for your tasty nugs, for your extra.  I think it'd be a whole scene.  Well, we wouldn't mind a caravan.  Yeah.  Can we get like Deadhead type caravan?  Can we follow you from town to town?  Paul, whatever you want to do.  Whatever you want.  We're just going out there to have some fun and, you know, hang.  Give out some stickers.  Give out some stickers.  Hang.  Drink some Sam Adams.  Just want to tell you, I caught a very cool show last night. 
[01:00:00]  Blues Traveler's Supper Club.  Blues Traveler.  It was smoking.  Then they went down late night to CBGB and did a 2 o'clock show down there.  Right on.  Very cool.  All right, man.  Peace, guys.  He's plugging Blues Traveler.  I haven't dug the Blues Travelers in a while.  Jennifer, you're the girl that started this mess of a show today, huh?  I'm at work.  I've got to be real quiet.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let me go in the bathroom.  You'll never guess what happened when I walked out in the alley.  No.  Come on.  Jennifer, now I know you're pulling our leg. 
[01:00:30]  No, no, no, no.  I was walking.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to get everyone up to speed.  Jennifer, the star of the show.  She was sunpanning.  She was walking by her neighbor's window and saw an older guy having some of that fine...  Having kid-packed sex.  Having some fine gay sex with a teenager.  Would look to be a 17 or 18-year-old.  Right.  And the guy's in his 50s.  Go ahead, Jen.  All right.  Well, I walked in the back.  I'm finally at work.  I'm all right now.  Okay.  I walked in the back alley, and I noticed that they had their back kitchen door open  because there's a front door and there's a back door in the alley. 
[01:01:00]  And they were just sitting there having coffee.  And I just walked by, and I got in my car, and I just sat there right before I turned my  ignition on.  Yeah.  And I was like, where are you?  It doesn't matter if you whisper it.  It's still the F word.  She goes, where are the...  You know what?  I really thought I was going to walk by and just hear the same crap over and over.  Thank God they stopped because I think they saw me.  I think they knew that somebody walked by and just went, huh?  Yeah, you were deeply disturbed by this today. 
[01:01:30]  Extremely disturbed.  And I swore, I hope I never see something like that again.  All right.  I just wanted to let you know that, oh my God, I really couldn't talk.  Plus, my phone exploded.  That was hysterical.  All right, Jennifer.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  There she goes.  She should have quit while she was ahead with story number one.  We got to get Otto and George in here.  Yeah.  These are the guys that had the wow sign at Ross War.  Where was it?  Oh, yeah.  Was that Nassau Coliseum?  Yeah, it was Nassau Coliseum.  These guys were right behind Jim Ross. 
[01:02:00]  You got the sign on you?  Yep.  Right behind Jim Ross.  Thank you.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  That's the thing.  I saw that one and I saw...  Yeah, that's the sign.  That sign's famous, man.  There it is.  The famous sign.  That's the famous sign.  That was on the whole night behind Jim Ross when Mick Foley sat down for a little while.  Mick Foley's going to be on the show tomorrow, I believe.  Yeah.  But, man, they got the Opie Anthony wow sign on the whole night.  Can we come back tomorrow? 
[01:02:30]  That would be fantastic.  Thank you.  Oh, look at that.  He's a little jerky boy.  Very good.  Aren't we supposed to have one of the jerky boys on today?  Yeah, Johnny.  Johnny.  Oh, thank you.  Hi.  How are you?  The funny one.  Would you like this framed?  I mean, he's got the Raw is War with the W and W and Raw and War.  Yeah, that's awesome.  I saw both those signs.  We're going to hook these guys up with some cool stuff.  You want to give some shout-outs?  Because we've got to take a break here.  Yeah, I'd like to say hi to everybody at work at Clearway Auto Parts.  Where's that?  That's in Queens. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  And my mechanic at Crispin Auto Techs who built a very fast car for me to drive around and terrorize people.  Very good.  Yes, thank you.  What do you do with this car to terrorize people?  Well, I take an 8-ball and then AR-15 and I drive around.  That's my future plans for myself.  And I hope to go to jail in a fashionable way.  Yes, thank you.  But very fast.  I want to go quickly, quickly to jail.  So I want to pull a whole shot and I'm going to start at high school and then work my way to my job. 
[01:03:30]  So everybody at my job at Clearway Auto Parts, please watch out.  I'm coming back to work tomorrow.  Very nice.  Thank you.  What the hell do you think?  You come in on a radio show, do a few invitations, get a career in radio.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a second.  I think that sounds familiar, doesn't it?  I try to learn from the best place.  This is the radio.  And you got a shout out?  Yeah, I just want to give a plug for a restaurant I'm partnering that's opening tomorrow night.  George Martin's of Southampton.  Cool.  Southampton.  Sixth and Nugent Street.  Nice. 
[01:04:00]  What kind of food?  Ted Nugent Street.  Steaks, pasta, seafood.  Right on.  We have another location in Rockville Center also.  Oh, do you guys get together on this deal?  No, he's the one with the money.  I'm poor.  I like you.  I work for Clearway Auto Parts.  Thank you.  I'm going to be paid for the rest of the day, I hope.  Thank you.  You should get a raise for mentioning the place.  What was that?  Three plugs, like four grand, right?  Or three darts in the back.  You didn't have to take any darts in the back. 
[01:04:30]  That's it.  Well, guys, thank you so much.  Yeah, great job, man.  A lot of people saw that.  Yeah, you get the wow signs or the O&A signs on live TV, and you come down here, and we hook  you up with all sorts of stuff.  I am going to write O&A on the back of my car when I do go on my shooting spree.  Great.  I figured that would get you some publicity.  Please visit me in jail, and send me some Italian food.  Thank you.  All right.  Quick break, Big Pussy, and Otto and George.  Yes.  And as we go to break, Drew Boogie came in with some fine new remixes.  Yes, this one's called Break Out the Excedrin, and they will know what it is when it starts. 
[01:05:00]  He's from a man's horn.  He has got to be the dumbest person we've had.  What's your name, son, man?  You're a little bitch.  This is not fair.  I bet you'd like to suck you.  Do I have to answer that?  Don't make fun of me.  What's your name, son, man?  You just answer that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  She is going to be the dumbest person.  Watch this.  How are you?  Hello?

Hello?  Okay.  Hello?  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:06:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Did somebody put this retard out of his misery?  No, no.  Hey, that's a good night, man, because I made it after this.  I made it after this.  Here comes the music.  The power of the wow singer.  How old are you?  18.  Oh, you started on wow.  Fabulous.  Well.  Holy ratioli.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, duh.  1027 WNEW.  Get ready.  Get ready.  Ooh. 
[01:06:30]  And whip about the wow singer.  With only your integrity.  N.E.W.  It's the O&A Show.  212-757-1027 is our phone number on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Lots of ladies wowing all over the place.  Thank you very much.  A bunch of guys calling in to say they got wowed.  We kind of don't play that game anymore.  No, it's kind of, it's dull to take calls on it. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, I saw boobs on the rug.  Great.  Well, we'd like to hear.  We'd like to hear from the ladies and see where they're wowing.  That's always cool, right?  We like when the girls call with a wowing in progress.  Without a doubt.  We talk them through it.  Yes.  Keep your boobs up.  Keep straight.  Keep level.  All right, you're coming in.  Ben left the studio.  He goes, here we go.  Be nice today.  Here we go.  There's two dumps.  I can't wait to read that later.  You can't say the T word?  No.  No, they kind of get all flustered at the T word. 
[01:07:30]  Otto, we'll help you today.  Fun bags.  You can say, yeah, you can't say the T word.  And the new one, we can't say the M word for pleasuring yourself.  No way.  Yeah, the master word.  The master one.  You can't say it.  The FCC, they're gay, man.  It's a big pain in the ass.  It's actually our management.  They're the...  Oh, the management here?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's one of those...  Frightened, suit-wearing idiots.  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  If you're watching Godfather and Bravo,  they'll show a guy shot in the forehead and strangled to death  and urinate on himself,  but they won't, you know, have the S word or a naked woman's fun bag.  Yeah.  Who decides this?  A guy shot point blank in the forehead  and the blood sprays out the back,  but you can't say the S word.  Yeah, that's okay.  Yeah.  That's okay.  But Sonny Corleone's saying,  I'm going to kill that freaking guy.  Yeah.  Smashing somebody in the face with a garbage can lid is all right.  Sure.  But God forbid we see a breast. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's insane.  We all...  Bull S.  Bull S.  I hate myself for saying that.  I love the dirty language.  Yeah.  I mean, it's fun.  It's part of Americana.  Live for that.  Yeah.  We like Home Alone.  Everybody like Goodfellas because Pesci's filthy in that.  I mean, every other word is F.  Yeah, exactly.  Love it.  B-S.  F that.  Lots of Fs.  You've got to work your way around it.  Like, I slammed my C up her A so hard, her F-ing T's fell off. 
[01:09:00]  You know.  Which is it for each curse.  I'm pretty loaded today.  Not right now.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  George, calm down over there.  Spend the money on the cursing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, Otto, you don't have money to spend.  You're getting a new George.  It's going to cost you a pretty penny.  I'm going to kill that little pussy puppet.  Ten grand.  A maggot.  I'm sure George might feel a little odd about being replaced.  I cost six hundred.  He's spending ten grand on the new one.  Too busy spending all your cash on white powder mine. 
[01:09:30]  I just had a hoot.  Six hundred dollars you spent on me, you junkie jerk-off.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  So, George costs six hundred, and the new one's going to cost six.  Six hundred.  I believe that.  Yeah.  I brought my friend Joe Piccoli today.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Uncircumcised P word.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got foreskin, you know. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  How about that?  He just tells me.  I never see it.  I was wondering, like, how does that even come up in conversation?  Yeah, that doesn't come up with my friend.  Yeah, I got a black hair.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  Yeah, the C word for the male parts isn't good either.  Is Pussy Crouton all right?  Huh?  Pussy Crouton all right?  I like what you think in the outer room out there, that filthy rug.  I was playing Name That Stain earlier.  I think I've seen a grease spot in the chair where Rich Voss was sitting the other day.  Filthy, slimy Jew. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, tomorrow at Rascals.  That's right.  Otto and George and Jim Norton and Rich Voss at Rascals in Westhouse tomorrow night.  Yeah, Pussy 2, a puppet act.  It's going to be a great show.  It's going to be like a religious show.  Yeah.  And the trailer park trash in the audience.  Yeah, absolutely.  Hey, that's our audience.  Oh, they love it.  All right, all right.  As long as you say you love them.  Oh, I love them.  Great.  Yeah, that's the cure-all.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter how bad you bash anyone.  I'm like Norris and Voss going at it. 
[01:11:00]  As long as you say...  Yeah, but he's a good friend of mine.  I'm only kidding around.  I've hit him really hard, but if I came in there, I'd love him.  I'd do anything for him.  Yeah, I love the guy, though.  Yeah.  Hey, Mary wants to explain the editing on Bravo about the Godfather that Adam just brought  up.  You work at Bravo?  Hi.  Hey.  Hi, Mary.  How are you?  Quite good, Mary.  No, seriously.  Seriously, I work for Bravo, and we get called all the time about the editing for the Godfather, 
[01:11:30]  but we don't do the editing ourselves.  The show comes like that from the distributor.  Well, why don't you get the original version and play it?  We can't.  We're not allowed.  They used to on Bravo.  Not anymore.  Why?  See, why?  Because they wanted to make more money by running commercials, and some of the sponsors didn't  like some of the language of the movies that were on.  Unfortunately, yeah.  When we went commercial, we had to go by the rules of a network. 
[01:12:00]  Bravo used to rock because it was like you were getting a cable channel for nothing.  It was like another HBO, but 90% of the time, they're playing crappy old movies you don't  want to see, but then occasionally, you switch past and go, oh, crap, Godfather's on.  Yeah.  Great.  Exactly.  It used to be awesome, but then they went commercial, so.  Why would you even watch the chopped up version of the Godfather?  Why bother?  It's a great film that even if it's on, you still got to watch it just out of respect.  But then you get disappointed when they, you know, take out the words.  Yeah, like I have a tape at home, but I still watch it because they were doing interviews 
[01:12:30]  with the actors as well.  Yeah, that's cool.  There's a lot inside stuff that you never heard.  Plus, there were restored scenes that were also.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Yeah, you can't pass up an airing of the Godfather.  That's for sure.  What's the purpose of your call anyway?  So we can learn.  Yeah.  The learning experience.  That's right.  Yeah.  We can't just say T, A, and C all day.  Oh.  We got to like, you know, have some intelligence here.  Go rinse the head cheese in the drinking fountain outside.  Thank you. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  George, relax.  You've looked at that fountain, huh?  That's pretty rank.  Yeah, yeah.  That's nasty.  I realize that some people still drink out of that fountain.  Really?  Yeah.  There have been people that come in here and we go to one of the interns, hey, get so-and-so  glass of water or something.  Yeah.  They come in with the water from the fountain.  And we mean go upstairs to winds.  Yeah.  So they have a big sparkless jug or whatever the F it is.  And just get them some clean water.  They come in, there's like sea monkeys swimming in that water. 
[01:13:30]  It's amazing.  Raise a family of sea monkeys.  No joke.  It's disgusting.  It's like some cloudy water from the Dr. Sensitivity Memorial Fountain.  Are you happy I said your name now?  Okay.  You'll pay for the parking now.  Get my partner an eight ball.  All right.  Wow.  Don't come cheap.  All right.  Don't come cheap is right.  George, you have a problem with Otto's drug thing or what?  Yeah.  Lots of problems.  It seems to be coming out a lot today there.  You guys mentioned Action Park yesterday. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  I like that place, man.  Yeah.  It was a cool place.  You wait in line to drown, you know?  You get a toe tear with the price of admission.  Hug your parents before you go to Action Park.  I'd like to swing on the rope into the cement wall.  How long will wait for that?  That's a good one.  I'd like to slide down a 90-foot razor blade into a box of IV needles.  Is that a long line?  Wait.  Cock-a-doodle-doo.  Is cock-a-doodle-doo all right? 
[01:14:30]  You're about to say cock-a-doodle-doo.  Cock-a-doodle-doo.  A-puss-a.  Of course, we like the a-puss-a.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  Let's go to Spank.  Spank, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to know when Otto and George's show is next.  Or their next show is.  Yeah, we just said it, I think.  Rascals and West Orange tomorrow.  It's Otto and George, Jim Norton, and Rich Voss.  A very good lineup.  All right.  Where do you live?  I live in Jersey.  What part?  North, south?  North.  North?  Yeah, that's perfect for you.  Yeah.  Rascals tomorrow night. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  It's selling out fast.  Call up, Al.  Yeah.  That's a good room, man.  Stress Factory on the 20th if you can't get out tomorrow.  Stress Factory, New Brunswick.  Nice.  We got a lifeguard from Action Park now.  Really?  Uh, James.  Oh, three, Anthony.  How's it going, guys?  And Otto and George and Joe and Drew Boogie in the house.  What's going on?  I heard Big Pussy needs a roommate, another unemployed zilch.  Kill yourself.  What's up, James?  Nothing.  I used to work over in Action Park. 
[01:15:30]  Who cares?  Hang up on this thing.  No, no.  That was good.  That was in Verona.  Vernon, right?  Vernon or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's in Vernon, New Jersey.  It's still there?  No, there's some ski lodge there now.  Ah.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know, but some guy, he was on the Tarzan swings, and he was afraid to let go  when he was over the water.  Why?  Jeff Morris was there?  He let go at the wrong time, and he hit the rocks.  You shouldn't even be able to do that.  Like, there shouldn't be an option that that might happen.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:16:00]  One guy was drowning.  One guy was drowning one day.  I didn't feel like the water was...  You don't understand.  The water is freezing over there.  So you didn't want to get him?  I wasn't about to go in, so I saw him the buoy thingy, the little circular hoop thingy.  Yeah.  I hit him in the head, and he got a little slice on his head.  Huh.  Oh, he was ready to sue the park for that, but, uh...  So what are you working out, Wild West City or the Turtle Bag Zoo?  Yeah, I'm on Staten Island now.  You're on Staten Island?  All right.  Yeah.  Lay down.  How are you doing, eh?  All right.  Here you go, guys.  The guy hit a rock.  George is a miserable F. 
[01:16:30]  I know.  You've got to love it.  I'm in your life preserve.  The guy hit a rock.  You've got to love it.  That's great.  Let's go to Sandra.  Sandra, what's up?  I'm a miserable F.  Hello?  Right.  Hey.  Hey, it's Sindra.  Sindra, what's up?  Sindra.  I'm on Route 80, okay?  Going west.  All right.  Every day for, like, the past two or three years, I've been looking for WOW stickers.  Oh.  Oh.  Sindra?  Oh, damn, that phone.  It just is not happening.  All right.  So you want a WOW, but you're not seeing the WOW stickers on Route 80 going west. 
[01:17:00]  What do you mean, cue cards?  You're a whore.  Take the pins out, you slut.  I'm all ready today.  I've got my button-down shirt.  I've got my push-up run.  Wait.  That line was too good and no one heard it, because you said T instead of the fun bag.  Oh, God.  That was too good.  Oh, sorry.  Sindra, what?  So you're ready to WOW, but you...  Oh, my God.  I've got my button-down shirt on.  I've got my push-up run.  Yeah.  I'm a hot bring out.  I've got 36 suns, sea breasts.  So I'm ready to show them, and there's nobody around. 
[01:17:30]  Well, guys, you're crazy not to have the WOW signs, right?  Right, George?  Right.  Yeah, George?  Maybe they're on the front of the car.  If you thought of driving into incoming traffic.  That'd be easy.  The flash is happening, wouldn't it?  You're calling the community right off 80 West.  And that thing about Action Park?  Yeah.  It's called Mountain Creek now.  Ah, well...  It's still open, but they took out the Alpine Slide.  All right.  Thank you.  The Alpine Slide was the half-pipe of cement that you rode down on a little piece of plastic with wheels.  At speeds so great that if you wiped out, you would take off so much flesh and just leave a skid mark of blood, flesh, and bone in this pipe. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, that place is horrible.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  It's a slaughterhouse for humans.  Got it in the herd, right, George?  Yeah.  Anthony.  Hey.  Hey.  I want to ask, I don't know, George, why are they playing Bloomingdale, New Jersey?  What's where?  What's the name of the gig?  I guess it's like the Fireman's Hall or something.  Yeah, it's a firehouse.  Those are great audiences. 
[01:18:30]  I live down the, well, up the block right from there.  I passed it going home, and I, you know, I listen to Owen all the time, and I'm just dying laughing.  Well, they say burning babies, don't they?  Aren't they entitled to a nice show on a summer evening?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  What's your problem?  Yeah.  Hey, the whole town's only got about three teeth.  Three teeth?  Well, split them up.  All right, Anthony.  All right.  We'll see you over there, Tony.  It's causing problems there.  Corey, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Great.  Hey, Otto and George, help me out for a second.  I got to belt my friend. 
[01:19:00]  Back in 1991, in a comedy club in Yonkers, did you play there?  Yeah, Shooting Stars.  Shooting Stars, yeah.  Yeah.  Heavily mobbed up place.  I used to love it there.  Yeah, it was actually even owned by Grandpa.  No, no.  Grandpa was the name only.  It was owned by Goomba Johnny and a bunch of other, you know, half-wit mobsters.  Was it really?  What about when Lyle Alzado owned the place?  Same thing?  Yeah, Lyle Alzado, yeah.  Well, I don't talk ill of the dead, but...  Yeah, because I've been telling my friends for years that I've been seeing you guys.  You guys are like one of my favorites. 
[01:19:30]  Thank you, man.  And you know what?  It was great.  Well, she's my ex-girlfriend now.  She got up to go to the bathroom during your set, and you guys called her a dirty whore.  Okay.  She was a whore.  David Berkowitz.  Oh, it was great.  David Berkowitz.  Wait in the car.  Oh, you guys are great.  Hey, guys, can I get WWF tickets?  Ah, no.  Come on.  I heard a story.  Is this true?  Did someone once, when you were street performing, stab George?  Yeah, that's very true.  I heard this story the other day. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I was stabbed.  I have a scar in my middle knuckle here from where I hold the head stick.  Sliced my hand up.  And I don't really know what provoked him, because I wasn't really that on an attack mode then.  Yeah, but he had that crazy stare where he was fixated on the puppet.  He might have been on some hallucinogenic journey.  Right, right.  He couldn't take the face and everything looking at him.  And I maybe told that story twice, and then it just spread through the industry. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  It's like the second question I'm asked after, is it true that Dice stole your best stuff?  And how do you feel about that?  That's the second one.  Those are the two, no, I'm not picking a fight.  Those are the two questions I'm most asked.  I'm the one that stabbed the dummy.  Which way?  Yeah, that's true, Anthony.  Wow.  And then I, what, because somebody told me this story, it might have been Boss, and said that  after he stabbed it, he made George actually say something. 
[01:21:00]  Well, like, he killed me, I'm dying.  Right, you didn't break catholic.  The only thing is a country.  I'm still in character.  Yeah.  That's so true.  I suppose it's a compliment in a weird sort of way.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, he actually believed that puppet was real or doing something.  Stupidity.  A knife could hurt him.  No shortage of stupidity, man.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  White castles are fun.  I ate a white castles yesterday, man. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I farted in the middle of the night.  I thought somebody crapped on my pillow.  It was horrible.  You know those hot...  Horrible, man.  If you're in a small elevator with a midget, that's manslaughter.  Right.  Yeah, the ones that smell like raw sewage.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Horrible, man.  They're delicious.  What's this with the Bobby Kennedy doll that you want? 
[01:22:00]  This guy who makes my puppet could make a puppet of any photograph, any friend.  He could make an Opie or an Anthony puppet.  I mean, it would be a dead ringer.  So I was thinking a Robert Kennedy puppet would be just obscure and a total waste of money.  Nobody would care except me.  That and a pink baggie.  Yeah.  Think of all the whore jokes you could do with that.  I know.  How many children did he sire before he got the pellet behind the ears? 
[01:22:30]  He had like 36 kids, right?  Wow.  Well, about 11 or 12.  Happy Irish sperm.  How funny would a Gorilla Boy puppet be?  He could have one, baby.  If the mouth was sealed shut, it would be very funny.  Wow.  Hey, here's a guy.  His friend almost lost his arm on the Alpine flight.  Just kidding, Jeff.  I love you.  I love you.  Ever since the humor.  Huh?  Chris, what's going on?  One time at Traction Park. 
[01:23:00]  I had a friend of Mars.  We all went on a field trip.  Believe it or not, they had school kids down here.  Anyway, we were on a bus trip.  But you've got to be on a ski lift to get to the top of the Alpine side.  So I'm looking down, and I see this kid fight it real hard, get up, and he's missing a limb.  No.  Stop.  Yes.  And it's sort of kind of like Disneyland.  They rushed him out of there, and they like hosed off the slide, and they open it up. 
[01:23:30]  Hose it down and keep it rolling, right.  Keep it rolling.  By the way, that T-line got onto the air, by the way.  Oh, good.  Nice.  All right.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Traction Park.  They're giving us a little leeway today, allowing George to say the T-word.  You guys sometimes regret that you can't go to the beach on a nice, warm day like this,  and you're locked in here?  Yeah.  You feel right?  Yeah.  Thanks for rubbing it in.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I was just thinking about your lives and how, you know, everybody else is. 
[01:24:00]  Actually, most people are sitting in miserable traffic now, so at least you're not in traffic,  right?  I mean, we don't have the life of a comedian where you get to have fun all day and then,  you know, stay out all night.  Is that what it is?  Actually, it's turned into a day job.  You're like the only afternoon radio show.  Everybody, like, wants me.  I'll see you in the lobby at 5.15.  Yeah.  Right.  It's always a 40-minute drive.  I'm getting up earlier than a farmer now.  They found a way to turn this into a day job.  It's finally crept in.  There's no joy in staying up late anymore.  Yeah.  It's a miserable day job.  Most gigs require you. 
[01:24:30]  Like, I did this one gig.  I had to do three radio shows, two in the morning and then one in the afternoon.  It was horrible.  And two shows at night.  I had a pounding headache.  You're up the whole day.  Yeah.  And a pound of sugar.  No, I mean, I didn't even drink it.  We better stay in the afternoon just so, uh...  I was so miserable and felt hungover.  We'll stay in the afternoon just so Otto, you know, has a place to come where...  A place to go in afternoons.  Where he's happy.  When you sleep late.  Thank you.  A lot of people, though, you think about it.  It's nice and warm up.  Most people have a 9-to-5 gig, you know.  Yeah.  And then by the time they get out of work, there's no going to the beach. 
[01:25:00]  No.  It's too late.  Yeah.  This sure beats regular work, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're not going to the beach, but it's not like we're sitting behind a desk.  We bring the girls to us, Otto.  Yeah.  You guys are rock stars.  The beach girls.  Put the sand on the console.  That's why George is miserable.  He wants to be at the beach with the girls.  Yeah.  You ever notice the lifeguard chair is like a hundred feet from the ocean?  What the hell is that?  Anybody ever drown in sand?  All they do is hit on chicks all day.  You can't swim in an erection.  It's like rowing a boat with a safe hanging off your ass. 
[01:25:30]  That's good material.  Thank you.  Here it is.  Death at Action Park.  1982.  Let's see.  A 27-year-old man killed after being electrocuted while on the kayak experience ride.  Nice.  How many kayak experiences involve electricity?  Two other victims also suffered electric shock and were hospitalized.  An investigation, blah, blah, blah.  The ride's equipment poorly installed and maintained, 
[01:26:00]  and an electrical problem existed in an underwater electrical fan system used to simulate rapids.  Throw a toaster in the saltwater pool and shit and go.  I see some spots.  That's great.  Wow.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Doing well.  We're hanging out on George.  Excellent.  Listen, uh...  How you doing?  We used to do plenty of trips to Action Park in Setter County, 
[01:26:30]  so we'd start primarily on these coach buses with the hallucinogenics.  And by the time we'd get there,  one of the best forms of entertainment at Action Park was going to the wave pool.  And you'd get all these kids from the inner cities who didn't know how to swim.  And the pool would just be completely filled with these kids.  And they turned this pool on.  It was complete chaos.  People were even drowning.  Lifeguards tied it in. 
[01:27:00]  It was more pressure at this world pool than any lifeguard job in the country.  It was unbelievable.  I remember that because they would let the kids in.  Then they'd start off the waves.  So it would be all nice and calm.  And, yeah, these kids from the Bronx are standing there going,  Hey, this is nice.  It beats the fire extinguisher or the fire hydrant on the road.  Oh, these inner city kids?  Yeah, and then they'd kick over these waves.  And it's like a tsunami.  It's like a scene out of...  What the hell is that movie with the boat that sunk?  The Andrea Gale. 
[01:27:30]  It's like perfect storm waves.  Going over here.  These poor little black kids are just like...  What?  Black children trying to swim.  And it looks like a bowl of lentils still killing yourself.  Wow, George.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Nice.  Two boogies going to kick your ass.  Hey, girl, what's up?  Get the M&Ms out of the pool.  Oh, jeez.  You had something to say, Rick?  Rick has something to add to this. 
[01:28:00]  No, it's just I remember that because, yeah, you used to go in it,  and the kids that didn't know the waves were coming,  they just thought it was a regular pool.  Yeah.  And they're splashing around.  They don't have any life preservers on.  Next thing you know, they're clinging to the sides of the wall  while the waves come up and smash them in the face.  They're spitting up water.  They're getting pulled out.  Nice.  Hilarious.  Death and dismemberment.  I can't lie.  I got caught out there a couple of times in Action Park.  Really?  And I can swim.  Those waves are strong.  They're strong, huh?  Oh, yeah.  They're insane.  Where'd you learn how to swim? 
[01:28:30]  I'm Jamaican.  It's in the jeans.  Oh, man.  He's skinny, too, man.  Look at him.  He's like a sandwich away from Karen Carpenter.  Look at him.  Come back to Jamaica.  Bob Marley is dead.  No more Rastafarians.  We just want your bread.  Kildy Whiteman.  Kildy Whiteman.  Kildy Whiteman.  Kildy Whiteman.  Kildy Whiteman.  All right.

Yeah.  And we're talking about Action Park a little bit, Anthony. 
[01:32:30]  Thank you to Otto.  He brought it up and the phones are going nuts.  Got a couple girls here that have a comment.  Heather, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  They had this water slide at Action Park that was like 50 foot high and it was straight down until it curved at the end.  Uh-huh.  So everybody, all the guys would stand at the bottom and they would wait for the chicks to get up.  Oh, yeah.  Their bathing suits would be up their butt.  Yeah, the bathing suit would have a wedgie and sometimes their tops would fly right over their heads. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  So then, so my sister and I decide to get on it and we go down and you're at the top and you've got to like fold your arms and pray that you stick to the slide because it's so straight down.  Yeah, they tell you cross your ankles and put your hands over your chest crossed.  That way you fit in the coffin easier after they pull your lifeless body out of the pool at the end of it.  Right.  So, so we get to the end of it, you know, of course, we're picking our bathing suits out of our butts.  We had to run to the bathroom because not only does your bathing suit go up your butt, all the water goes up your butt. 
[01:33:30]  You get like an enema.  My sister and I are in the bathroom cracking up next to each other because we've got these enemas.  Nice.  Yeah, great.  That's funny, Heather.  Thank you.  Yeah, bye.  And you know, Tina's on line 10.  She wants to say the same thing.  So I guess it happens to the ladies.  Worth a try.  Yeah.  Another one for the dump sheet tonight, huh?  Go to foundrymusic.com tonight and check out the dump sheet to see what George just said. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Tina, what's going on?  Hey, that slide is actually 200 feet high.  Yeah.  And they make you get on a scale and they measure how tall you are before they'll even let you go down.  That should be your first cue not to get on it.  Again, for the coffin because they really didn't care about your safety at Action Park.  That's for sure.  I went with a group of people and all the guys, I guess they didn't fold their ankles because they got off that slide with the dumbest look on their face because they shoot water up it at the bottom in order to slow you down so you don't fly across the park. 
[01:34:30]  You're supposed to cross your ankles to hold your legs together.  That was the principle of the thing.  So you wouldn't get water in places where you're not supposed to get that much water.  And for the guys, it's so your testes don't end up on your chest.  Well, these guys went home squeaky clean.  Like Private Ryan with chlorine.  Thank you, Tina.  Take care, guys.  So it's the enema slide. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Hey, we got a big star on the hotline, Anthony.  I know.  Got to say hi to Vinny.  Vinny.  Vinny.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Calling from Dallas.  We're talking a big pussy.  I'm down here in Dallas, Texas.  I was supposed to call you an hour ago, but the time is different down here.  Oh, you're late.  So, like, it's 4 o'clock on my watch down here.  What were you doing for the past hour?  Talking to the feds?  Putting on your wire?  Your rack?  That's why I'm hanging out with some of my buddies down here, witness protection.  That old guy. 
[01:35:30]  There's a lot of them down here in Dallas.  Yeah, call Tony.  We know where big pussy is.  Yeah, we'll help him out.  Did you watch the show?  Yeah, every week.  Are you kidding?  Of course we watch.  That is the best show on television.  Absolutely.  What did you think when they came up to you and said,  Hey, Vinny, look, it's like this.  We're writing you out.  They're writing me out?  Yeah.  They weren't writing me out.  Well, they're writing you out means, like, you know, they're writing you off the show.  I'm not off the show.  I was a few weeks ago.  You pop in on the little flashback scenes and stuff. 
[01:36:00]  I'm not written off.  But you're dead.  But technically, it's television.  You don't know what to do.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm down here in Dallas doing a movie.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm down here working with Elizabeth Hurley.  Oh, Liz Hurley.  I'm buried down on the movie.  I pulled out.  Yeah.  Yeah, Liz Hurley.  What's the movie about?  It's called Service and Sarah.  We're trying to serve her divorce papers.  Oh, God.  Comedy.  Romantic comedy.  Yes, divorce is hysterical.  Just ask me.  Huh?  I didn't hear that. 
[01:36:30]  I said divorce is hysterical.  Just ask me.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  You know?  Believe me, I'm...  Oh, I should serve you your papers.  I'm in the process of knowing.  I should serve you your papers, Anthony.  Believe me, it's worse than the water slide at Action Park when I'm getting up my keister.  He called you a fruity ass.  I love that.  Oh, you guys know that song, too.  Oh, that was great.  Comedy.  I love doing comedy.  Oh, it was great.  We'll have a lot of fun.  Very fun.  The director's original Huddland from...  He did Ladies Man and Boomerang.  Oh, sure.  It was a lot of fun. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Vinny, that's Otto talking as well in the studio.  Okay.  And he's got a little dummy on his lap called George.  Yeah, man.  Was it a puppet?  Yeah.  It's a puppet.  Yeah.  It's Otto and George.  You got problems with puppets, Vinny?  No, I got no problem.  Just those dogs.  You know that dog?  The insult dog?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't like him.  You don't like the...  No, no.  Vinny, that's a puppet, too.  I know it's a puppet, but, you know, I did Hollywood Squares with the dog.  How do you feel about bullpen hammers? 
[01:37:30]  You did Hollywood Squares with the puppet dog?  So, what do you want to talk about the show?  Talk to me.  Yeah, I want to know...  Give us a little insight.  Well, I have no insight.  Come on.  What's going to happen?  Give us a little piece.  Because, you know, I don't get the scripts anymore.  I'm a guest star now.  Yeah, no one sucks about having you guys on.  Yeah, no one will budge and tell us...  No, nobody talks about the show.  No one will give us a little something like...  No, I have no idea what's going to go on next week.  If they talk, they actually kill them, Opie.  That's amazing.  Yeah, they're really, really wacky.  A lot into the realism.  Yeah.  All right, who's going to die?  Jackie Jr.? 
[01:38:00]  I have no idea.  Christopher?  I think he's going to die again.  Again?  Yeah, again.  I have no idea who's going to die.  How about...  Give us a little insight on you and the mirror.  The mirror?  Yeah, all of a sudden...  Well, it was his thoughts.  Yeah.  Yeah, it wasn't really him.  When he went to Asbury, he was thinking about me again.  Right.  And he's trying to figure out when I, you know, when I turn, you know?  I guess they'll probably write a couple more shows.  Yeah, but you're not going to, like, come walking out of the water?  I have no idea what they're going to do, you know? 
[01:38:30]  It's been so long since I worked on the show.  In fact, since I left the show, I've knocked off five movies.  I've been just running around all over the country.  Big Pussy's not dead.  You know, I'm just...  He's not dead.  I'm just moving along, you know, trying to survive.  It's the name everyone remembers.  Pussy?  Everyone loves saying it.  Yeah, I love Pussy.  Yeah.  In fact, I got...  Say, Jennifer, say hello.  Hello.  See?  Hello there.  Yeah, that's Jennifer.  She's, uh...  Little Pussy.  She's down here in Dallas.  I'm going to bring her back to New York with me.  Yeah?  Yeah, say hello, Jen.  Say hello to these guys. 
[01:39:00]  Who are you?  Hello, guys.  Are you Vinny's girlfriend?  Is it my girlfriend?  Yeah.  No, I don't have a girlfriend.  You don't?  No, I just like the...  It's a gomah.  Hey, Vinny, you want to bang Jennifer?  Do I want to bang Jennifer?  Yeah.  She's old enough to be my mother.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I sounded young.  She sounded young.  No, she's a youngie.  Yeah, she's a cutie.  Hey, Jen.  Yeah, she's hanging out with me today.  Can we talk to...  Look at you.  You're living the life, aren't you?  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  She's not your girlfriend, though? 
[01:39:30]  Are you married?  No, I'm not married, so I'm not getting in trouble.  And it's not your girlfriend?  You can't get me in trouble with this phone call.  No, no, absolutely not.  No.  But it's not a girlfriend, though?  Yeah, she's a friend of mine.  She's an actress.  Oh, nice.  In fact, we're going to put her in a movie of ours.  Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  A little casting.  No, no, no, no.  We don't go by that.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm looking up, guys.  Yeah?  Hey, Vinny, you're also in that movie Under... 
[01:40:00]  Under Hellgate Bridge.  Yeah.  With...  Yeah, we shot that a few years ago.  Me, Dominic Chenezi, Frank Vinson, Jonathan LaPaglia.  You know who...  We had the preview last night.  You guys know?  You know who Dominic is?  Uncle Junior.  Uncle Junior.  But in Hellgate, he plays a priest.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And I got a movie coming out, Deuces Wild, so I play a priest, so figure that one out.  Hey, there were some rumors going on about that he might swing both ways, boys and men.  Who?  Uncle Junior?  Uncle Junior.  Yeah.  What, you guys read, The Globe?  Yeah, that's where we read it. 
[01:40:30]  That's where we get all our hard news.  That's where you get information from The Globe.  Yeah.  I like the high-hard ones, Tony.  Read The Times.  Read something that's, you know, legit.  Or the Dallas...  What's this called?  The Dallas News?  I like the young boys, Tony.  So talk to Jen.  She wants to get discovered.  Hey, big pussy.  What?  Uncle Junior's in the studio.  He's in the studio now?  Yeah.  Big pussy.  I always liked the young men.  I like that big pussy.  The only pussy I ever liked was big pussy.  Yeah.  Till he turned.  I like that.  I got the ass cancer, pussy. 
[01:41:00]  What am I going to do?  Yeah, definitely.  You sound just like him.  Tony, help me.  I got the ass cancer.  You and Bobby Bacala.  We went to West Virginia.  Me, Steve Scherup.  He plays Bobby Bacala.  Yeah.  Tony Ventimiglia.  Bobby Bacala.  And Federico.  We had a blast.  I hope you didn't go in a pinto.  We went to a casino right next to a nuclear power plant.  A big casino.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Hmm.  I don't know what that means, but it's interesting.  Yeah.  I got demoted.  I don't run with Sirico and Michael no more. 
[01:41:30]  I run with Bobby Bacala.  Bobby Bacala.  Yeah.  That's someone that's associated with you.  Okay, guys.  So it's nice chatting to you.  I want you to say goodbye to Jennifer.  Say goodbye, Jennifer.  Goodbye.  Give him some action.  He sounds...  Yeah.  Okay, guys?  All right there, Vinny.  Okay, bye.  Thank you.  They're going to be doing any movies that aren't having a premiere of Blockbuster.  Boy, it's his career in a dumper.  Well, George, you're awfully brave when he hangs up.  I'm a quadrosexual.  I'll do anything with anybody for a quarter. 
[01:42:00]  He sounded a little tense.  Yeah.  Big pussy.  A little tense.  Maybe he's busy.  That guy was a laugh riot.  Back to bed.  We disturbed him.  He was trying to get it on with Jennifer.  Work it with Jennifer or something.  Hey, Johnny.  Hey, hey.  Did we just lose Johnny for the turkey boys?  He's scared, see?  No.  I think you scared him off.  Johnny.  Hold on. 
[01:42:30]  Let me try that again.  Big pussy was in the turkey boys movie.  Yes, he was.  He was funny.  Fruity ass.  Fruity ass.  He was a fruity ass?  No, they kept calling Alan Arkin fruity ass, and he was like his henchman.  Hey, boss, this guy sounds tough.  He called you a fruity ass.  Funny.  That was a funny movie.  He's got that lisp by Giuliani, that sort of speech impediment.  Hey, Johnny.  No.  Johnny there?  All right.  Try to get Johnny back.  All right.  Johnny's back. 
[01:43:00]  And red, it's a ride.  Sorry.  A little Greg Brady song, man.  I don't know what happened to Johnny.  I want to, this is the jerky boy I want to talk to.  We keep getting that Kamal guy.  Yeah.  He keeps calling up, why are you hanging up on me?  What?  Oh, my God.  Let's talk to the funny one.  I know.  Well, Kamal was...  That's like Oats calling.  You know what Oats?  Yeah.  The other guy from Wham.  Or Garfunkel. 
[01:43:30]  George.  Yes, sir.  That's like Otto showing up without George.  Well, he'll call back.  Yeah, he's got a call.  He won't get $20 in powdered sugar.  $120.  This might be him.  Call him back.  Yeah, we'll see if...  I'm just going to plug it down and see what happens.  Hey.  Johnny.  Yeah.  Johnny, what's up?  Hey, man.  Finally.  Johnny, let me introduce you to everyone.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  We have Otto and George in the studio.  Joe.  And a friend of ours, Drew Boogie. 
[01:44:00]  Hey.  How's everybody going?  We don't want you to get all confused when you hear, like, six different voices.  No, I'm used to that.  So, what's going on, man?  Yeah.  What are you up to?  You kind of dropped off the face of the earth.  Nah, I'm keeping busy, man.  Yeah.  Cartoons, you know, commercials, things along that line.  Yeah, we do hear you on the commercials every so often.  Yeah, I do.  You know, you ever see Family Guy cartoon?  Yeah.  Yes.  I do a few of the voices there.  You do?  Yeah.  I do Mort Goldman and Horace the bartender.  I do a lot of the New York type voices.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  I'm going to have to look out for that. 
[01:44:30]  I heard you said Vinny on.  Vinny Passori.  Yeah.  In your movie.  Tough Guy.  Yeah.  Tough Guy.  Hey, what the hell?  Any more tapes coming out or something?  Yeah, brand new one, man.  It just came out.  It's the sixth one.  It's called The Jerky Tapes.  Now, is Kamal involved in this at all?  Who's that?  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  All right.  What is that?  What are you guys trying to be cute?  No, I'll be honest with you, man.  We had him on the show a couple of times over the past three years. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  And all we...  We didn't want him on the show.  No, it annoys the crap out of him.  We go, do the Frank Rizzo bit.  And Mike gets all this tall.  Because we know.  We know it's you.  We're like, do Saul.  Do Saul.  No, that isn't me.  No, I don't bend this bit.  You know.  So you guys just bust his chops.  Yeah, we bust his chops.  And then we found out that you two had like a falling out.  Can I tell him why?  Because this goes way back.  You might not even remember.  But you did our show when we were up in Boston, Johnny. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I think I did it a couple of times, actually.  Yeah, live.  And let me tell you something.  You were so cool, a gentleman.  And we really got along with you.  And Kamal, I mean, you knew how to work it on the air.  You were funny.  Yeah, and Kamal, I mean, was just being...  Just had that rock star attitude.  He was really just an ass to Anthony and I.  And we never forgot it.  So we came to New York, and we're doing pretty well.  And he'll call our show.  Well, you know what?  In this business, let me tell you something.  You step on people on the way up.  You know the old saying, you know?  Yeah.  You got to do your thing and get the hell out of there, you know? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, so we really ride him hard.  What a funny, fat-bag-a-douche.  Oh, you know, the guy's crazy.  Oh, boy.  The other guy who blew up my balls with mustard jazz.  Is that the kind of thing he's throwing that stuff on you?  Yeah, that was it.  Yeah, that was it.  Now, what happened between you two?  Because you guys were like, you know,  you were the Lennon and McCartney of prank phone calls.  Yeah, well, you know, actually what it is, man, 
[01:46:30]  it started a long time ago for me just doing these voices as a kid.  So, I mean, I just started, you know, I said to myself,  like, this is going back almost 20 years.  Like, I got to get these voices on tape, I'm saying.  And then I said, well, how, you know,  what better way to do it than have the characters interacting with other people?  Yeah.  And the phone was just the medium.  And I think that's why it's been so successful,  because it really wasn't about just prank phone calls.  Yeah.  It was about the characters and getting them out there, you know?  Yeah, and it was funny.  Yeah, well, thank God, man.  You know, it's, I mean, you're talking about 8 million records sold.  I mean, thank God it's been a wonderful, wonderful ride, man. 
[01:47:00]  So what was the falling out?  Well, you know, what happened was, I mean, you know, it's not a bad thing,  but, you know, I guess Kamal's head really wasn't in it, you know?  It's that same showbiz thing where, you know, one guy is, like, you know,  doing all, you know, the work.  Ah.  And, you know, the other guy is, like, you know,  and he doesn't feel comfortable in his position.  I guess that's the best way I could put it.  Oh, he was kind of, he didn't like being overshadowed.  Yeah, he didn't like, you know, to get this slapping around, you know,  you're a little, you know, little tough guy slapping around.  It'd be like the Leo Gorsi thing, you know?  Yeah.  He didn't like that.  The Leo Gorsi thing, that's perfect. 
[01:47:30]  But, I mean, he's on to his own thing.  And from what I hear, he's doing, I've seen, actually, his, what do you want to call it,  a documentary there about Hell's Kitchen, and it's good stuff.  So he's doing his thing, you know?  Yeah.  I, you know, I haven't seen a hair of him in, I think, three years now.  Three years?  You haven't even uttered a word.  What would happen if you guys got in the same room together?  Well, jeez, you know, I haven't seen him in so long.  I don't know what the hell the guy's up to.  Yeah.  That's kind of weird that you did a movie together, and, you know.  Well, I've known him since he was a kid, too. 
[01:48:00]  He's, like, since he's about five, six years old.  Really?  Yeah, you know, he was like a kid brother to me.  You know, he really hurt me.  He really turned on me, guys.  He did.  See, there's, even when Kamal was talking, there was some underlying thing that just isn't really getting out.  Was it a chick?  No, man.  No, the truth of it is, it's like I said before, it's just like he wasn't happy in his position,  and, you know, then he starts barking about things, you know,  and he's going out all over the country on radio and saying things about me.  I know. 
[01:48:30]  He says a lot of things to a lot of people, but I just, you know,  what am I going to do?  I can't be looking at that crap.  You were the whole show.  He's stunk, and everybody knew it, and he can't live with himself.  Well, you know, I can't.  You know, just the negativity, man, that's a waste.  Yeah.  That's Otto.  So how are you guys doing, man?  Good.  We're doing good, buddy.  We're having fun.  We'd like to, you know, come in and hang out one day.  Yeah, I think I'm scheduled for June 1st.  Oh, cool.  That would rock.  So what's up with this new tape?  It's really good, man.  Did you guys get a chance to hear it yet?  No.  You've got to check it out, man.  It's insane.  There's a call on this one.  It's called a flower lady, right? 
[01:49:00]  When my manager was getting married, and this chick is calling his house.  She's an old lady, and, you know, I just happened to have my stuff at his house,  and I got this call, and when you hear the call, you won't believe how she's driven insane.  Then when he went out to get the clearance from this old lady, she damn near almost stabbed him with a knife.  I mean, she chased him down and literally almost killed him.  And so, I mean, we had to work that out, and we got the clearance from her.  But when you hear it, you'll see what I'm talking about.  She gets insane.  And there's a great one on there about the Yankees, New York Yankees.  I put an ad out in the paper saying that I could get you on any major league baseball team, any football team. 
[01:49:30]  You know, inside of a week, you'll be playing for your favorite team.  And I had calls like you couldn't believe.  And there's one of those on there from the New York Yankees.  You've got to check it out.  Which character are you using for that?  It's Frank Rizzo.  I love the Frank Rizzo.  Yeah, Silverman, it's called.  Yeah.  Is Frank Rizzo anywhere near you?  Yeah, look, Frank Rizzo.  Hey, Frank, you get Frank where I sit.  I'm right with you.  Open your finis, Jackass.  I ought to put a good shoe right to your nuts. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, one of my favorites, obviously.  Jerry, stop it.  He's great.  Love the song.  I like the one where the guys are up on the roof chasing each other around with the hot mobs.  Yeah, I got these crazy little Mexican bastards.  They're up on my roof there swapping each other with the hot mobs.  Next thing I know, one of them comes down right through my effing window, right into the living room.  What the hell's the matter with these guys?  My wife's up there.  She's poking around like she knows what the she's doing. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's classic stuff.  Very good, Johnny.  That's old-time stuff.  All right.  Well, you know something?  You're coming in here in June, right?  Yeah, June 1st, man.  All right.  Bring the CD with you.  I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.  Like I said, I want to give a big shout-out to the fans.  Okay.  And, you know, New York and everywhere, man, these fans have been incredible, and thank God.  We're having fun, man.  Right on.  Yeah, we'll get into it when you come down, all right?  All right, man.  Looking forward to it.  Thank you, Johnny.  See you guys later, man.  Good luck.  All right.  Right.  There he goes.  Wow.  Nice.  What a soft-spoken guy. 
[01:51:00]  I know.  You figure the way he is, like,  What a shy.  Come on.  What a jackass.  You know, you figure he'd go off, but he's like, no, you know, negativity.  There's a story there to be told.  Yeah.  It wasn't just something that developed.  There was a blowout.  Yeah.  And we will never know about it.  I love crap like that.  What is he into?  Dianetics?  He's got to be some...  Dianetics.  Zero rage.  The readings of L. Ron Hubbard.  Yeah.  They hate me.  That's cool. 
[01:51:30]  All right, we'll break.  Yeah.  As we go to break...  Yes, Beth?  Yeah, okay.  We'll do more, Drew Boogie.  As we go to break, make sure you vote for the whipped cream,  Bikini Contest.  Yeah.  We're down to eight girls.  You've got to vote every day.  Very eight...  What?  What?  What happened then?  Oh, eight girls.  Oh, I got this hot lesbian neighbor.  She's really cute.  Yeah.  She likes to lay on the couch naked with a towel under her behind,  and then lets the stray cats in and have lunch.  So, I now have an erection from... 
[01:52:00]  Just...  Come on, stop that.  Nothing like a nice sandpaper tongue licking a hot lesbian.  What color is the towel?  Pink baggy, all right?  Okay, yeah.  Sure.  Now you will hear Drew Boogie's mix,  as it sounds as the delay builds.  It's always great.  We might have to wait a few seconds now 
[01:52:30]  to let the delay come back.  How many minutes after Johnny hangs up,  does George start bad-mouthing him?  That's from someone in Queens.  If your sister is married to a guy,  that's your brother-in-law, right?  Yeah.  So, what would his brother be called in relation to me?  Let's see.  Step-brother-in-law or nothing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's nothing.  Oh, okay.  What?  My...  My...  You're nothing. 
[01:53:00]  My brother-in-law's...  Yeah.  My brother-in-law's brother is a huge fan of you guys, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  He's always listening.  He loves you.  He's a retired cop.  Great guy.  Right on.  We love the cops.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's for sure.  What I was going to say before George decided to curse about 10 times,  whipped cream bikini contest,  you've got to vote every day.  Did you guys see the pictures of the girls?  No, can I please?  You want to see that real quick?  Can I relax while I look at the monitor?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Here's some of the girls in the whipped cream bikini contest.  Let's get past all the warnings,

There you go.  Damn.  She is in the lead right now,  but it's anyone's.  It's anyone's game.  It's like two spots of whipped creams on her meat curtains.  Nice.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Get the...  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, see?  We call this one the thoroughbred.  Looks like when you lined up at Belmont  watching them parading from you before the race.  Come on, Cordero, you little monkey.  Yeah.  Otto, you have an open invite.  When you know we're doing this type of thing.  Oh, hell yeah.  I can just come down.  Oh, thanks.  And there's...  Oh, look at this one.  Right.  Yeah, it's cute.  Yeah, look.  Look at that, right?  All right.  So, look at this pose.  Rick loves this pose.

[01:56:00]  You have 30 seconds to wow me.  Hmm.  Whip on mouth!  Whip on mouth!  Whip on mouth!  Check this out!  Wow!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  187-WNEW.  Oh!  Anthony, brand new sponsor to the O&A show.  Yes.  It's BMW Films.  Films?  We saw a couple of these films before the show today.  Saw them today.  They were really cool, like a five-minute action movie. 
[01:56:30]  Nice.  We had a blast.  BMW Films has a new website that's showing cool new short films made especially for internet  viewing.  The website is BMWFilms.com.  BMW Films, they snagged some of the hottest directors.  They got a John Frankenheimer.  Go right now.  BMW Films.  And check out Ambush.  You know what film John Frankenheimer?  Ronin.  Ronin?  You don't like the Ronin, right?  I like the car chases, but it wasn't a De Niro film.  Yeah.  Ronin wasn't one of the best.  Yeah.  But you know something?  You said you liked the car chases. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  The whole short film is car chases.  Really?  This movie that the Ronin guy did, yeah, it's a major...  Oh, he directed Manchurian Candidate.  He's a great director.  Reindeer Games, Birdman of Alcatraz.  Yeah.  All we're saying is, you said you liked the car chase, and this BMW film, it's just a  five, six minute film, and it's just an awesome car chase.  Really awesome.  And you know something?  The people at BMW Films love cool guns, because I've got to tell you, they were shooting at 
[01:57:30]  this BMW that this guy's driving, trying to get away from this van full of bad guys.  The weapons in this short film, probably the best sounding weapons on a soundtrack I've  ever heard.  Yeah.  Really authentic.  And I like guns, Opie.  You know me.  Yeah.  I love the guns.  Go to BMW Films right now.  Check out Ambush.  It's directed by John Frankenheimer.  There's also a new one, Chosen, directed by Ang Lee.  That's right.  That one was a little weird. 
[01:58:00]  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Sense and Sensibilities, and The Ice Storm.  I think that was more the chick flick one of the two.  There was still some car chases and stuff.  Yeah.  Other upcoming films on BMW Films include The Follow, directed by Wong Kar-wise.  And Star, directed by Guy Ritchie.  In between Slamming Madonna, he can direct these short films.  Is that a website?  Yeah.  BMW Films dot com.  Powder Keg also, directed by Alejandro Gonzalez in Yiritu. 
[01:58:30]  That guy stole my car.  And he filmed it.  If you like Waterworld and Heaven's Gate, go to this crappy website.  No.  No.  Crouching Tiger, Chocolate Starfish.  Yeah.  Oh, George, you don't understand.  Take your money out of the bank and burn it.  George.  Oh, no.  We love our sponsors, George.  I love short films.  Well, Otto, I know you have no problem with this, but I have a problem with George.  Making fun of our sponsors. 
[01:59:00]  George, you obviously have not been to BMWFilms dot com and checked out the films yourself.  It's okay, because the puppet said it.  Right.  Exactly.  Do it now.  Go to BMWFilms dot com.  Check these out.  They're really cool.  Five-minute action films are what they are.  BMWFilms dot com.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One bad door.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  1027 WNEW.  That's Nickelback, Ant. 
[01:59:30]  It's O.T.  It's Otto and George.  It's Joe.  It's a lot.  True Boogie in the house.  212-757-1027.  We were talking about Action Park, Ant.  Yeah.  We keep going back to Action Park.  Well, because everyone has horror stories about it.  What did that one guy call Action Park?  Action Park.  Action Park.  That was classic.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I used to work there not too long ago, and the stories I heard were amazing. 
[02:00:00]  Before they got rid of that alpine slide, some girl came down, fell off the little slide,  and lost her nipple.  Ouch.  I mean, you know, like when you're a kid, the rug burn off, you know?  Think about it.  Rug burns rest.  Oh, straight the red.  It's loaders sink.  It's loaders sink.  It disintegrates.  It's amazing, right?  There's pieces all the way down.  Oh, man.  We used to end the site, though.  Oh, guys, you don't know.  Yeah.  We used to sit up there in the work, Chuck.  Oh, yeah.  Okay. 
[02:00:30]  Work got done.  Come on.  Yeah, it didn't seem like many people were working there.  Yeah.  But the funniest money out, like, every week for lawsuits.  Oh, wow.  You should have seen it, guys.  We'd leave a ladder on the side of the building.  Somebody would be working on the roof.  Fifty little kids running around on the roof because they thought the ladder was a ride.  They're running around.  It's like, guys, off the roof.  They jumped in.  They did jump off the roof ride.  Right.  How do you know the difference between the rides and...  A bunch of roof monkeys.  Oh, it's amazing.  Put some piranha in the bathtub. 
[02:01:00]  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Hey, have a good one, guys.  You got something on the Internet, too, Ann, about that?  Yeah, there's a guy that just wrote this whole kind of an ode to Action Park.  He grew up.  We used to go there a lot of times.  And like the guy said earlier, field trips would go there.  And this guy says it was tempting fate like playing Russian roulette every time you go there.  Because every summer, he says, nearly every July, someone would drown in the waypool  or be killed in a freak go-kart accident.  Action Park was less a water park and more a complete insult to the evolutionary concept 
[02:01:30]  of self-preservation.  That's great.  Action Park's character was defined by the fact that it was situated on the side of Mount Vernon.  Not only was it impossibly hilly, it was set almost entirely on concrete and asphalt.  So while you shuffled up 45-degree inclines from one whiplash-inducing water slide to the next,  you ran barefoot over sole-scorching surfaces and hoped a sudden spurt of friction didn't send your toes crumbling under your own feet.  Yeah, you really would get a lot of stubbed toes. 
[02:02:00]  No amusement park that exists today is as labor-intensive as Action Park was.  About half the rides forced the participants to get their own tube or sled at the bottom of the hill  from the hands of dazed folks who had just completed their run.  This was not easy to do because the people who had just finished their ride would stumble off  in a blind stupor, completely confused, and not assured of their own place in the universe.  You would. You'd get off of those things. You wouldn't know what happened. 
[02:02:30]  The first thing you'd see involved a sled and a ramp of metal rollers.  You slid down the sled across the metal rollers, reaching speeds of roughly 300 miles an hour,  and skipped 30 feet across the surface of a very shallow pool.  The metal roller ramp had no guardrails on them.  There was always the possibility that you would veer off the side and fall very quickly into two feet of water.  Since there were four metal roller ramps emptying into this pool in tandem,  snarls of sled collisions were constantly occurring, 
[02:03:00]  making it look like the Cross Island Expressway on Friday night.  It was insane. Remember that?  And the big water slide with the inner tube?  You could fit seven people in it.  If tried to approximate a mountain rapid, that's what it did,  with lots of bumps and obstacles and so forth,  but the most dangerous part of it was the fact that the borders that kept the tubes on course  were criminally short.  And just off the side of the Colorado River ride was a steep tree and prickerbush-lined hill. 
[02:03:30]  It was the perfect demonstration of the action park philosophy.  Put seven people in a large inner tube, pushed them down a wet slide,  and let the laws of physics handle the rest.  People would gather around and watch folks scream their way down,  cheering and hoping that the tube would hop the barrier and go careening down the side of the hill.  When a large family would come close to flying away,  the whole crowd would gasp and then sigh in disappointment like the audience at the Indy 500  when the Tide car just narrowly missed hitting the Pepsi car 
[02:04:00]  and exploding in a beautiful orange ball of flames.  This guy did a great job.  We ought to post this.  That's very funny.  It's a long story on the...  That's next year's Survivor Series right there.  They ought to do that.  Yeah.  Send them to Action Park.  See what happens.  Dental records in the bathing suit and go for a shirt.  16 comics telling bad jokes in Action Park.  Yeah.  Hey, Jay.  Jay.  Jay Moore, everyone. 
[02:04:30]  Where are you?  You wrote that thing, Anthony, that you were just reading.  That was brilliant.  I know.  This guy's got it knocked.  You grew up in Jersey, so you know about Action Park.  Mount Vernon, New Jersey, baby.  Alpine Floyd.  The Alpine...  The first time ever on a ski lift was going over that concrete mountain of death.  Alpine Road Rash.  They give you the sled.  You just have to take a ski lift up.  So as you're going up, you're looking down at these tracks at the carnage that will have to be you.  Thank God it had that brake handle on the front. 
[02:05:00]  What was it covered with?  Vaseline on the bottom to slow it down?  I saw paper when I was going down the street with my green machine as a kid.  Green machine.  Remember the green machine?  Yeah, just throw the kids on a big wheel down a big hill.  Was that the head that went straight down, and when you came off, your swim trunks were absolutely inside your rectal cavity?  Yeah, we talked to a few girls that said it was like an enema.  Yeah, they called it the enema slide.  Oh, but enema doesn't bring in the crowds.  You've got to give a name like death slide.  Death slide.  Because enema slide, people probably won't climb up to the top of the hill for it. 
[02:05:30]  Hey, Action Park, they would have.  Remember quick clacks?  What's up with that?  Good night.  Hey, did anybody tell you about how cold the water is?  God damn, Otto and George.  Remember that candy?  It was like little dots on a piece of newspaper.  Throw some sugar on the post instead.  It sounded like a combination of Otto and George talking at the same time. 
[02:06:00]  That was Otto doing Bob Levy.  Good friend, Bobby.  Bob Levy.  Good old Bob Levy.  I'm a name dropper, huh, Jay?  How are you, brother?  Good.  No, I don't have a tape of you on Action.  No?  I have it somewhere.  Dude, you've got to throw your weight around.  Call your friend Buddy Hackett.  He'll get it to you.  He knows people.  He can make people fall out windows for you.  You're the star of the goddamn show.  You can't get him a tape of the show with him on it?  The show's on FX.  I thought I'd have to freaking tango and cash for crying out loud.  Didn't you send away for the complete Action series on DVD? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, I got it with my Civil War chest set in the mail yesterday.  You hop-head.  Where are you?  L.A.?  Yeah, I was at the last factory last night.  There was like 11 people there.  I was just doing like Otto's act.  Again?  How did that sound?  How you doing?  Oh!  Get him back.  Now it's mine.  Now it's mine.  Which way?  I'll be wearing a green carnation with vomit on it. 
[02:07:00]  Marilyn, tongue my starfish.  We are all mortals.  All right, Jay.  Give us a call tomorrow.  Oh, nice talking to you.  Oh, Jesus.  We're hanging with Otto and George.  Wow, what did Otto say?  He said I ran out of stuff to say, but I said the S word.  Oh.  Now they'll pick it up somewhere down the line, maybe.  Jay, you got a funny story?  No, I'll tell you when I come into town or whatever.  Okay.  It's a timeless piece.  All right, good.  Gentlemen, keep the show rolling. 
[02:07:30]  Sorry to take time out of your day.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Don't worry about it.  Well, I'm being facetious.  You know, who loves Otto more than me?  Otto's been here for...  My mother and my sister.  Well, I haven't heard the proper talk.  Larry.  I'm on the phone.  Well, see, Otto's been here an hour, and, you know, Big Pussy called in.  He's doing 1-800-COLLECT commercials now.  The Jerky Boy guy, Johnny, called in.  Yeah, at least it wasn't that Indian Kamal.  Yeah, I know.  The funny part about Action Park is watching the black kids come up out of chlorine water for the first time. 
[02:08:00]  Talking about that.  That's funny looking and I'm like, what?  Green soda in the pool.  Let's shove them in.  When they would put these inner-city children in the wave pool and then kick on the waves, it was hysterical.  Why?  Because they were Puerto Rican, too.  Well, they're just not used to water with that clean.  Enough squirting out of a fire hydrant.  Right!  With a tin can.  Big Pussy's doing 1-800-COLLECT commercials. 
[02:08:30]  So is your boy Piazza.  Yeah, and they got him in Dodger Stadium in a nameless jersey.  That is Big Pussy right there.  You see that?  I play for the Mets and they actually do a commercial, but stand in another stadium with a fake jersey, I tell them to shove it.  Hallelujah.  What a queer...  Like you need some money, too.  I know, yeah.  $15 million a year.  Whoa, dial down the middle!  Me and Doug Flutie's retarded kid will raise $5.  Wow! 
[02:09:00]  Whoa!  Because I had a problem with Doug Flutie.  If you dial that 1-800, whatever the Doug Flutie one is, it says that profit goes to helping autistic children, correct?  Yeah.  Correct.  Read the fine print.  It says up to .02% of all profits go.  That means out of a million dollars, 20 freaking dollars go to a retarded kid.  Wait a minute.  A million bucks, 20 bucks goes to a retarded kid?  I'm not a math major.  Sounded good.  How much is .02 of a million?  Uh, boy, more math? 
[02:09:30]  No, I said George.  I was trying to set everybody up so I can get out of this gratefully.  Boy, you guys normally want me off the phone.  You guys are really cruising.  No, George is just, you know, staring, uh...  We had a good show going on until you showed up.  Nice console.  Is that Gorilla Boy?  No, it's another guy.  It's Joe.  Hi, Joe.  How you doing?  I'm sorry I ruined your show, Joe.  Dr. Sensitivity again for you.  Who's that?  We don't know.  He came in with Otto and George.  We don't know. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, Joe, next time you clean the oven, crack a window.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  That sounds like he's going to hang us.  Listen.  Uh-oh.  I don't work there, because...  Yeah, why?  Because you can't get in with the Jews?  You know why?  Because I can't get in.  I can't, like, get on the good side to get on this stage.  I think there's politics involved there, because I wait in line and everything.  I can't get in.  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I tried to pass there once, me and Mick Waszynski, and he's clean, and I'm dirty.  We're both real funny, and Missy didn't pass either of us, so I know it wasn't anything 
[02:10:30]  I did.  She was just...  She's just a miserable, you know...  Pauly Shore's mother.  Yeah.  I saw Mick Waszynski...  So, Pauly gets to play in the club, and you don't.  That's stupid.  He gets to roll out of bed and come down.  That club has a bad vibe, anyway.  Oh, it's haunted, that place.  It is haunted.  It's a miserable place.  Yeah, there are ghosts in the basement.  There's ghosts everywhere.  There's Parisi sitting at the door.  Another one of Dice's stooges.  Niels Parisi with his Joey Buttafugo pants to hide his doggie velvet Crown Royal bag balls. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  All right, Jay.  Hey, Jay, man.  All right, well, that was an interesting social experiment, gentlemen.  Well, there's a lot of different...  I have no negative energy going your way whatsoever.  Do what you got to do.  A lot of different personalities in the studio today.  Real fast, and then I'll leave, is I saw the pictures of Best Boobes contestant, Britney Spears.  Who?  The honorary Best Boobes contestant on foundrymusic.com. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  There's a shot of Britney Spears that you guys probably already know of.  Oh, with the two top...  Even though I had to turn a computer on, so I just got it.  The see-through tube top, right?  Oh, I've cranked like five of these out already.  That is such a fake picture, though.  Yeah.  It's not real.  It's not real.  It's not real.  No way is that real.  What are you talking about?  No way.  I'm looking at it right now.  Photoshop.  One hand.  Photoshop, my friend.  It's not real.  Somebody made that.  Those boobs are definitely fake, because they got...  Those nipples are like first and third. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  You stand at a home plate, and those nipples are checking the runners.  All right, Jay.  All right.  See you guys.  Thank you.  There goes Jay Moore.  I only asked them twice for that action thing.  I mean, I did fly out to L.A. and tape the thing.  Other comics who weren't even involved in the production told me they saw the dub.  You know, and plus, you know, when I was up for this Cameron Diaz movie, they wanted  to see some of my acting chops, and that was one of the things I was trying to hunt down  to send to this director, because he's a fan of mine. 
[02:12:30]  So, you know, he's acting like I'm hawking him for this tape.  I just want to see it.  I'm a fan of Buddy Hackett.  I did the work.  I just want to own the footage.  That's good for a little resume stuffer.  I just want to own the footage.  But the people that don't know, you were in an episode of action with Buddy Hackett.  I'm like harassing him.  And you just want to dub him.  I'm like talking to him at once at home, and that's it.  I left it alone.  He's too busy.  I'm not resentful.  I mean, I'm not obsessing over it.  I would just like to see the scene.  Other guys have seen it.  And I did it, and I haven't seen it.  He kind of jumped on you there. 
[02:13:00]  I don't have your take.  That's the only thing I want.  I don't want anything from him.  I just want my footage.  You know what?  We can put the word out, and someone will have a copy of that tomorrow for you.  I did Morton Downey's show when that was on, and the producer was calling me every five  minutes of the week.  After I taped it, I couldn't get the guy on the phone.  Once they're done with you, they're done with you.  Forget getting the footage.  You know, we can relate to that.  Not like here.  Oh, yeah.  We can relate to that big time.  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah, man.  They kiss your ass, and they get you.  And then when they're done with you, they don't even know you. 
[02:13:30]  They don't even know you.  I don't know why you're second later.  Right.  It's the way the business is.  Do you want a copy?  Because we'll get you a copy.  There's a listener out there who has it.  I could get it from Barry Katz, or, you know, one of the producers.  Barry.  Yeah, Jim Valli.  I'll get your tape for you.  No, we'll get it for Otto, man.  Yeah.  Someone bring the copy down, and we'll hook you up with some good stuff.  Barry, look out with the dub, you hook-nose mocking.  Come on.  Let's get it.  Boom. 
[02:14:00]  Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop.  Wow.  Boom.  Let, let, let them hang.  Wow.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  Wop, wop, wop, wop, O.B. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Kamal.  Yeah.  What's your problem?  No, I heard you guys talking some wonderful things about me.  We were talking to Johnny.  What's up, guys?  Yeah, if you want, I'll come down, Jim, first.  You want to come in here for the first ever meeting of you and Johnny in three years? 
[02:14:30]  Why not?  Well, someone's got to talk eventually.  You've been hinting that there was a problem.  He's been hinting there's a problem.  Hey, can you talk about Fred Mineo from that, your record producer?  I'm a ventriloquist, and I was offered a record deal from him.  Otto, I really love your work.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, we're in a movie together.  Yeah, yeah, Rules for Men.  Rules for Men, and you were in my friend's movie, too.  Stu, Alton.  Okay, that is it.  Oh, Force Within.  Yeah, you were great, Matt. 
[02:15:00]  But listen, that guy is the worst.  Yeah, tough.  That's what I heard.  He's the worst.  Really?  Fred Mineo.  He screwed you out of money.  Oh, were you kidding me?  That guy, when we met that guy?  Yeah.  This guy had like a broken-down BMW, excuse me, Volkswagen?  Yeah.  When we left that guy, he had a fleet of Mercedes-Benzers and BMWs, like one for every day of the week.  No kidding.  Nice.  Yeah, he refers to a lot of people, kid and play.  Did he?  No, no, don't ever.  But you know who you should go to? 
[02:15:30]  He's good at his work, if he's a bilker.  Hey, you know what, though?  I don't blame him, because if you have a record company, what's your job?  Is it to give the other guy all the money?  Come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  Listen, if you want to come in, I want to talk to Johnny first.  I don't want to ambush him.  But I think it would be interesting if you guys have the same room and have three years.  You guys haven't seen each other in three years.  Yeah, it's a good radio.  Yeah, it's not good.  Well, look, if you guys are really that pissed off at me from that day, I really don't think you should. 
[02:16:00]  Hey, come on.  What, were you on your period?  No, I'm telling you, we used to do a lot of drinking back then, right?  No, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  I came to your studio so wrecked, I almost vomited.  Come on.  You were such a dick.  No, I wasn't.  Yes, you are.  Dude, I was always cool with you, because you looked like a guy I grew up with.  Come on.  I was nice to you like when I first met you.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm telling you the God's honest truth, okay?  When you left our studio in Boston, everyone said, Johnny, I'm telling you the truth.  Johnny, really nice guy.  Come on.  Dick.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:16:30]  Maybe you were drunk.  Maybe you had a bad day.  I met you guys twice.  I was like that both times.  I don't think so.  I think you were hammered.  Yeah, I was real hammered.  And another thing about that...  You've got to stay away from the, you know, the booze and the drugs.  Yeah, but you don't think it happened with that guy?  What, are you kidding me?  Let's get Johnny in here.  Come on.  I was sober and that guy came in all drunk and they said the same thing?  Really?  Are you kidding me?  We didn't have any of that.  We know it the other way.  What time are you on in Boston?  It was the same time.  In the afternoon drive?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, because you've got to remember, like, you know, back then we used to do a lot of morning  stuff and the night before we'd be out partying and drinking.  You know, we could really put them away, you know?  Do the toolbox bit.  All right, I'll come there with my tools.  That doesn't sound like it.  I know, because, you know, I was the one that did Frank Rizzo.  A lot of people don't know that.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's hear the Frank Rizzo.  I love that guy.  I know, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was one of my favorite characters to do.  Ready?  Yeah.  Get right where I said.  Wow.  That doesn't sound like him either. 
[02:17:30]  I know.  I'm so bad at doing that.  All right, let's not mess with him.  Let's hear some songs.  Okay, ready?  Yeah.  Because, you know, I did that, too.  It's all Rosenberg.  Yeah.  Now, come on.  That's it's old, man.  You're just saying, you're asking me to do it.  No.  No, that's it.  It's not old.  It's old.  It's old.  Come on.  Do Fred Mineo.  What's wrong with you guys being in my porno movie?  What's up?  Yeah, that's another problem we have with you.  You invited Anthony and I to be in your soft porno.  What's it called?  Too fat?  Wow.  George.  Fred Mineo and Peter Lorre. 
[02:18:00]  George.  George, you can't say that.  I want my action tape.  He says this is a movie called Two.  I want my $120 back.  He said, hi, he was the same name.  Your mother's the same name.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  George, George, you can't.  I want Otto and George in here.  Because he works blue.  I like guys that work blue.  Come on.  So what was the problem with you and Johnny?  Who's going to fess up to this?  I'll tell you the truth, man.  It's really nothing that fesss up.  It's just something that just, you know, started out bad and it got worse. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  And about this stuff about I'm his baby.  He looked at me as a baby brother.  I'm like, the guy's 5'7".  I'm 6'3".  How am I his baby brother?  Oh, now there's a problem there.  He said, baby, you are here.  So now we got a problem here.  Ah, we got off to a bad start.  Come on.  Stop dancing around.  What went down with you two jerks?  Well, I don't know.  What do you want me to do?  June 1st?  Come in.  We'll tell it?  Yeah.  I may knock out some people in that place. 
[02:19:00]  If Jay Moore is there, I swear to God, I'll punch that guy silly.  What's wrong with Jay?  The fact that he looks like a retard.  What's your problem with Jay Moore?  The guy always talks bad about me.  What the hell did I ever say about Jay Moore?  Everyone.  Everyone talks bad about you.  Yeah, that's true.  Can you put him in a headlock until I get my action done?  No, actually, thanks.  I'll buy you Heineken.  You fat guy.  Actually, I got no people with that guy.  I know this is all shtick.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[02:19:30]  But I love the guy.  Hey, come on.  Yeah.  So how are we going to work this out?  Because, you know, we don't really like you.  I know.  You guys don't like me because I think there's like some kind of sexual tension.  You guys are latent.  So, uh...  Well, that's funny.  Is that going to be a prank call soon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like those kids you were running two minutes ago are funny, right?  Which one?  All right.  Here we go.  Which one?  Hey, hey.  Do the Rizzo character.  You guys are great.  You brought a lot of laughing.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Wait, come on.  All right.  Now I'm going to get into it. 
[02:20:00]  What?  You are a pussy.  What?  How?  Because Johnny was on the phone.  You were listening to Johnny.  I swear to God.  Remember I told you to go to that German restaurant?  No.  That guy called me up after it happened.  I said, well, why did you call me up when he was on the show?  You are such a liar.  I swear to God.  Then how would you know if it was funny or not?  No.  He told me everything.  The German restaurant.  Oh, so the guy tells you, because he's a friend of yours, that Johnny was on the phone  and it sucked.  And you're going to take his word for it.  Hey, he goes like this.  He goes, hey, Kamal, your ex-partner. 
[02:20:30]  He called up and he starts giving me the German accent.  I said, well, why didn't you call me?  Is that a fit?  Is that a voice that you're going to use on the next date?  Is that going to be another character?  That could be another character.  That sounds just like all the other characters.  What?  It's a German bartender character.  But listen, I'll come over June 1st.  I would bet money that you heard Johnny on our show.  I swear to Allah.  He was on long enough that someone could have got a hold of you.  They called me after it happened.  I'm telling you.  I would have called.  And another thing, too.  I called.  In the words of George, poop.  Ha!  Your phone was busy. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, so now you're saying you did try to call.  I called when Jay Marr was on and it was busy.  Throw some sugar on my dub of action.  Well, look, if you guys want me on June, I'll come.  All right.  Hold on, Rick.  Do we have his info?  Well, you should get some more information.  All right, get his info.  We'll see if we can set this up.  Are you?  Yeah, why not?  Hey, hold on.  Someone wants to talk to you.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Yo, get this fat bastard off the phone.  He's boring me. 
[02:21:30]  Be nice.  Shut up.  Who's that?  Who are you?  Did you ever do an album, make anybody laugh?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Look, you walk around the damn puppet.  That's right, I do.  Yeah, you do nothing.  Yeah, who's that Tony?  Who is this jerk off?  Why is he talking to us?  Tony.  Yo.  Tony, go get hit in the phone box.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Get out of here, you greaseball.  Come on.  Yo.  All right, so you talk to Rick.  We'll see.  I think it'll be very interesting to have them both in the studio at the same time.  If you guys are so pissed off about the time I came all drunk and I was almost vomiting 
[02:22:00]  on myself.  You know, you don't be leavened unless we get Lily from the new Munsters agrees to come  in and I'm going to have to bump you up.  No, but these guys, these guys, man, you guys carry such a grudge, man.  You're worse than me.  No, come on.  First of all, Anthony and I have been around enough drunks in our time.  We know when someone's drunk.  You were just an ass.  No way, man.  I love you guys.  Well.  I'm serious.  There's some DJs that I don't like.  Like that Scott Shannon guy almost. 
[02:22:30]  I don't know why he's kissing everybody's ass.  He's just an ass kisser, man.  From the moment he got on the phone.  Oh, I love you in that movie, Otto.  You were fantastic.  That movie stunk.  Oh, Opie, I loved you up in Boston.  You were awesome.  Oh, Anthony, I loved you.  Go kill yourself already.  Get out of here.  We'll see if he wants to come in.  All right, he got drunk.  It's okay with Johnny.  Otto, we do have a hit list.  Yeah.  He's one of them.  Reunion.  But just for showing up drunk, I mean, isn't that like something you usually think is great? 
[02:23:00]  No, let me tell you something.  The guy did not show up drunk, okay?  We hung with, you know, all the musicians.  We know people when they're drunk.  We know people when they're on drugs, whatever.  And that's not an excuse if you're on drugs or alcohol.  You still could treat someone with respect and be nice.  Yeah, don't pull an attitude.  Yeah.  Now that you guys are way bigger, he wants to grovel, grovel, grovel.  But there's, we have a hit list.  It's Kamal from the Jerky Boys.  We took care of him.  Yeah.  Pauly Shore.  We took care of him.  Nice.  Yeah.  Took care of him good.  Real good.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  And there's only one other guy left, right?  Oh, Jeff Norris?  No.  No.  We love all the guys that are on our show.  Throw some sugar on our Sino Man.  And Bill Maher.  Bill Maher.  Oh, that's what a smug, intellectual bag of douche that guy is.  He was the biggest dick to us.  Ultra-liberal punk.  Biggest dick.  Child molester.  He stinks.  He stinks.  Yeah, he likes to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.  A gray, old, impotent faggot.  He's wondering if he can touch the show.  All right, listen, we're in the middle of commercials, believe it or not. 
[02:24:00]  Oh.  I still hate him.  Come on.  Yo.  Yo.  What's up?  All right.  He's still there.  Okay.  Hold on.  Proflowers.com, Anthony.  Yes, of course, Mother's Day this Sunday, Opie.

You're a jerky boy.  You'd think you'd have the best phone ever.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's doing a bit.  He's doing shit.  Who is this?  Who are we speaking with now?  Who's on the phone now?

[02:27:00]  Obi and Anthony.  N-E-W.  Yeah, it's the O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I love that.  They've made a career over, uh, out of doing the same tune.  Over and over again.  Over and over, but I love it.  That's Offspring.  Original Frankster.  Otto and George in the studio playing Rascals in West Orange with Jim Norton and Rich Vox.  It's going to be a great show tomorrow night.  Cold beer, good food, nice looking waitress.  Great club.  That's all you need.  Except when Dice is there, then it stinks. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, we've got to go back to the turn, the tub thing.  What the hell was that?  I was just listening to that.  See, I got an email earlier about that, and I didn't really believe the guy, but we're  running the commercial on our station here.  It says, boys, check out the ad for UPN 9 News at the bottom of page 84 of the Daily News.  Oh, it's in the Daily News as well.  It says, terror in the tub.  What is it?  What page?  Page 84 of the Daily News.  All right.  All right.  Here it is. 
[02:28:00]  Here it is.  Oh, my God.  Here's the end.  Terror in the tub.  Thank you.  Roll a joint.  No seeds this time.  They blew up like an M80 the last time.  Take the seeds out.  Put some sugar in there.  How do you think this will be?  Look at this.  Over 60 children have died using a certain bath seat.  So why is this product still on store shelves?  Don't miss our I-Team investigation at 10 o'clock tonight on Channel 9. 
[02:28:30]  Otto, we were talking about this yesterday.  They do these killer teases.  If they really cared, and this is a story about caring, couldn't they print what the bath  seat is right in the ad here?  Yeah.  Because now you're sitting there going, oh, I've got to give the little crumb stealer  a bath, and I don't know what the bath seat is.  Terror in the tub.  How exploitive and non-caring of them.  Terror in the tub is like, I don't know, Norton giving a kid a bath. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  That's terror in the tub.  I know.  It's amazing.  They do these killer teases all the time.  But it's like they care.  They try to present it like they, that's why they're doing it as a public service.  A public service would be right here in your ad that you paid for.  It's printing the certain bath seat, the blah, blah, blah, model number, blah, blah, blah.  And we'll tell you all about it tonight.  And we'll tell you why it's bad, but here it is just in case you have it.  Yeah, but no, we're going to make you wait, and then we'll finally tell you which seat.  They should start trouble to get, like, ratings. 
[02:29:30]  You know, we have the news before it happens.  Here comes John Johnson out of that building with a 10-gallon can of gasoline.  What's going on?  There's going to be a hell of a fire in about 10 minutes.  We have the news before it happens, truthfully.  That's what they've got to do to get the scoop, you know?  And then yesterday, is it safe to eat?  And be cleaned up.  We'll tell you about E. coli on certain brands of lettuce.  Yeah.  Like, well, and there you are.  I'm going to have my sandwich right here in front of me.  And it just so happened to have lettuce on it.  Help me out a little bit. 
[02:30:00]  Where is this killer lettuce?  Killer lettuce.  Killer lettuce.  Killer pink lettuce.  Wow.  Killer lettuce.  Yeah, there's killer lettuce out there, George.  Chocolate starfishes could kill you.  Killer lettuce.  Man, they're so full of crap.  It's so phony.  They're helping.  I know there's sand and spinach, but what can kill you with lettuce?  I don't know.  E. coli.  Really?  It's all over everything, that E. coli. 
[02:30:30]  It could clog up your colon.  That's nothing.  Walk it off, you bunch of pussies.  E. coli.  I saw a guy kill himself today.  It was really funny.  This guy is on top of the building.  He's threatening to jump.  The crowd gathered.  Typical New Yorkers.  They yelled up,  How big is your apartment?  Two bedrooms.  Lots of closet space.  Jump.  Die.  Get in the car.  E. coli, jump in any time.  Hey, I also have something on feeders. 
[02:31:00]  On what?  Feeders.  Feeders.  I don't know.  You know what a feeder is?  Bottom feeder?  Are you drinking our chloroceptic over there?  Yeah, I took a squirt.  I don't know.  It's good for your throat.  Yeah.  I thought he was drinking it, though.  I didn't think this would be throatfully.  I can't believe you squirted.  Got a squirt for that.  Why, has this been here since, like,  since Scott Muni was doing two-fers?  Yeah.  Gross.  Ever since Denny Moore's been in there.  Yeah.  Scott, so.  What's a feeder, Opie? 
[02:31:30]  A feeder.  Thank you, Anthony, for asking.  I think it's in the latest issue of Gear Magazine.  Hey, you guys had Florentine up here, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's fine.  I just worked with him in Albany.  Yeah, Jimmy's great.  He's a good guy.  I was helping him sell CDs.  He's great.  He did great shows.  Yeah.  He's got big testicles.  How do you know about your friend's testicles?  I'm proud of it.  Because he's always got the skin working.  Yeah, I got poor skin.  And Florentine's got the big testicles.  So a gig has to show me his genitals.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Well, it's something new every day. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  We'll start that around here.  Sounds like it's a winner.  Boss has got a stinky ear.  He does?  Yeah.  He puts his finger behind his ear and he pulls it out and it smells like ass and he makes  everybody smell it.  Oh, God.  Gustin.  What is that about?  I have no idea.  We have nothing to do, comedians.  All right.  Do you know what a feeder is, Otto?  No, I don't.  Okay.  We had one of these feeders, Otto.  I don't know what this is.  You know.  Oh, okay.  If we had it. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  The fat guy.  Well, let me.  Yeah.  Let me read real fast.  A quick paragraph.  Thin women are more elegant, but for sex, fat women get me hot.  Said an attendee at the goddess party.  It's an event that's held across the country where men with a fetish for large women come  to find their mates.  Okay.  These aren't chubby chasers.  A little different than that.  What's wrong with that?  I know.  I mean, that sounds like chubby chaser.  No, it gets better.  He is just one of the many men known as feeders who believe that when it comes to women,  there is no top limit to weight. 
[02:33:00]  While some men simply prefer bigger bodies, these men.  They literally feed their women into obesity.  They like them obese where they, like Jerry Springer fat.  Right.  Where they got to wheel them out of the side of the house with a corklift.  Correct.  Not only do I like a chubby woman, but I get sexually aroused at the prospect of a woman  gaining weight.  I heard the band skipped.  All in the family porno.  Good night.  That pig selfish fool.  And of course, there are many levels of feeding.  One man felt proud having added an extra 75 pounds to his wife's five-foot frame. 
[02:33:30]  Cool.  Yet another man fed his wife from 200 pounds to 600 pounds.  Nice.  Wow.  Over the course of 20 years.  When she was young, she said she was able to appreciate him enjoying me sexually.  Now, due to severe diabetes and painful arthritis, she doesn't often leave the bed.  And it is quite a production getting her from room to room.  And they dig, like, as they're getting fatter. 
[02:34:00]  That's what turns them on.  Yeah, this is the fetish.  She reminisces.  I'd sit on a stool in front of our ice box eating ice cream naked, and my husband would  get a blank on.  That comes from your dad shoving his junk up your egg.  I think that would do it.  Is that twisted or what?  I'd lick the fat crack and push her in front of a track to trail a hole and die a chaster.  That's pretty...  That's horrible.  Yeah.  Well, you into the fat broths at all? 
[02:34:30]  Unfortunately, I've had to a few times.  Chubby Chaser?  Yeah.  I mean, it's a little...  After three in the morning, anything goes.  Yeah.  You've got to eat a fat chick.  I've got to tell you, never, ever.  We interviewed that guy.  I nailed one fat girl.  She opened her legs so far, I could see her grandchildren's feet.  Ow.  All in the family corner.  Good night. 
[02:35:00]  Let's go to Craig.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, O&A.  Listen, I am so disgusted by the story you're having.  To me, when I see a five-foot-six woman, and she's over 105 pounds, I'm grossed out.  I said, how can these guys...  Oh, this is beyond chubby chasing.  I'm, like, getting sick at the start of that.  I've heard of this one before.  They get off watching their...  Yeah, their woman gets fatter.  Come on.  You saw the whipped cream bikini girls that are coming in.  Some of those girls got eliminated because they were a couple of pounds overweight. 
[02:35:30]  Can you imagine these girls?  Huh.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Keep the thin ones coming in.  All right.  Thank you, Craig.  Let's go to Big Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  It's Big Chris in the Bronx.  How are you doing, all right?  Your house is on fire.  Otto and George, how are you doing?  No, no.  I'm one of the white guys in the Bronx.  Listen, anyway, forget about that.  Remember about two years ago, you had a guy on.  His wife did this to him.  He ended up at, like, 500, 600 pounds.  That's a while ago.  Yeah, this was a girl that was a...  Right, right, right, right. 
[02:36:00]  She would feed this guy until he got so fat he couldn't move out of his house.  Right.  All right.  Otto and George, love you guys.  All right, thanks.  Take care, boys.  It was the same thing.  Yeah, we used to call it hog hunting out in Jersey.  Yeah, hogging or pigging.  Pigging.  Mike, hey.  She'll be chasing.  Guys, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, I saw this on TV.  This guy with his wife, he did that to her, and she was so fat, he had the bathing bed with  a washcloth in between all of the rows while she laid in bed.  She was so fat, she couldn't even go to the bathroom. 
[02:36:30]  Take a shower.  And then you see some pictures of when they first got married, and she was all slammed  her and stuff, and then for some reason she gets all fat, and the guy's got to sit there  like, well, you know, she's warmed up nicely, you know.  Hey, what about fat chicks with dyed blonde hair?  It's like you're taking a piece of dog crap and putting whipped cream on it.  It's still a piece of crap.  Thank you, man.  I don't know if I can't do this afternoon. 
[02:37:00]  I've seen the show about four times.  I know all you like.  Thanks, man.  Well, go see him at Rascal's Westar.  Can I do really good?  I'm doing Bob Levy.  I'm sorry.  I'm quoting a guy you guys don't even know.  I don't give a crap.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  You're entertaining me.  That's all I care about.  Hey, is this the more genre?  In one?  I have no idea.  Uh-oh.  I hope we have a lot of delay for this commercial.  Who is the silent negro that was sitting here for three hours and didn't say boo? 
[02:37:30]  That was Drew Boogie.  What does he do?  He does remixes for the show.  Oh, he does?  You're in some of his remixes.  Oh, really?  And he does a great job, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he's not one for talking on the mics, but behind the scenes he mixes his ass off.  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, this is the Mujan read.  We're actually getting requests for this today.  Really?  And I haven't thought about this in a long time.  I must really suck if you're playing me and I'm here.  No, no, not at all.  Not at all.  It just reminds us of another time.  No, thank you.  No, not at all.  So we could all sit here and laugh about it.  I forgot about this. 
[02:38:00]  Remember the Mujan read?  Yeah, absolutely.  The Mujan was what?  That stuff?  Hair removal?  Yeah.  And, yeah, we just started doing the read and George went off.  Yeah.  Yeah, George had his own little opinion on the website.  And couldn't breathe.  He was laughing so hard.  Let's go back in time into the ONA archives.  Uh-oh, I hope we have a lot of delay for this commercial.  Anthony?  Yes.  Mujan.  Mujan.  You want to explain to George the puppet what Mujan is? 
[02:38:30]  Mujan is a wonderful way for women to get rid of unwanted body hair.  Bikini line, legs, even mustaches, facial hair that girls might have.  And it's so much better than shaving.  Nipple hair, whatever.  It leaves the body very smooth.  Mujan.  Is that like electrolysis?  Uh, no, it's a strip that comes in a package of the Mujan 2000.  You press it on and peel it off and, uh, completely smooth. 
[02:39:00]  Wonderful, smooth, sexy skin.  The name is smooth.  It's basically yanking cubic hairs out.  You know, we just spoke at the people from Mujan.  We had a demonstration in our office.  It is quick, painful, and completely removes hair.  Do you have a hairy canish?  Try Mujan.  Here's you. 
[02:39:30]  Ah!  I hope the bastard appreciates this.  Yanking my torn ears out by the roof, so I look good in a sundress.  Ugh.  It should be called...  Yankee?  Wait, wait, that line has to be on the radio.  Oh, it's great.  Thank you.  It's easy.  Peel, press it off, uh, press it on and pull it off.  Unwanted hair, gone.  Almost painless. 
[02:40:00]  No.  Get to the part where you...  No, unpleasant.  Odors are chemicals to irritate the skin.  Mujan, gentle.  Has botanicals.  Hypoallergenic.  Removes hair completely.  It's slow to grow back.  Lighter, thinner.  Skin is softer, sexier than before.  Mujan.  It's wonderful.  You always throw that aloe in there.  There's aloe in there.  What is that?  I'm bleeding.  I'm taking you to a hospital.  There's aloe in there.  There'll be no blood from Mujan. 
[02:40:30]  It's wonderful.  It's so gentle.  We saw a demonstration.  The hair comes off.  Uh, you don't even feel it.  I know it's fine.  It's the most desirable way, uh, to remove hair.  You know what else is good?  Closing a storm window on your testicle is also good.  You know, for the hot weather.  All right.  Just drop a storm window on your teabag.  There's aloe in that window.  Do you want some aloe to get testicle? 
[02:41:00]  Mujan.  The most comfortable way to remove hair at home.  Why pay those salon prices?  Mujan removes hair completely.  Uh, it's available at Duane Reade, Harmon Cosmetics, Genovese Drugs, and, uh, Cosmetics Plus.  If you don't see Mujan, go to the store manager and say, hey, uh, my girl's got a poodle in her lap.  Uh, I need Mujan.  Um, and I got actual audio of a girl?  Yes.  After she, uh, you know, waxed her hair. 
[02:41:30]  Okay, let's hear her.  See?  It's so smooth.  She's so sexy.  She doesn't even need a brain anymore.  It's amazing.  So to get hair off of that,  Cousin!  No one even heard this spot, but it's a word.  I don't even give a crap.  Ten people on hold are enjoying this. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, they hear the unedited version.  Oh, yeah.  Not anymore, Otto.  There's aloe in there.  Thanks for asking ahead of time.  If you get hit by a truck that's carrying aloe, does it still hurt?  Ponder that one for a while.  Mujan.  The best way to remove that unwanted body hair.  All right.  Ask for that, uh, cosmetic.  And there you have it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:30]  From the archives.  I just thought of something.  Mujan doesn't advertise with us anymore.  Thanks, Otto.  Yeah.  I realized during that spot, too, I went, it's quick, it's painful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't even realize I didn't say painless.  Well, we've had requests for that.  That was just tape, right?  It's tape.  Yeah, no one cares, though.  Funny's funny.  Yeah.  Who cares if Otto and George are funny live, we're on tape?  They don't give a crap in the car.  Big Al from Jersey, three best live reads, Otto and George Mujan, Brewer with the sharper  image, Razor Rollerboard Scooter, and Bill Dwyer and the, um, and OD for Sam Adams. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  Remember that one?  Cool.  All right.  We're going to play What Do We Learn Next on the O&A Show.  All right?  Yes.  1027.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breath.  Boom.  Wow.  W-N-E-W.  Anthony Stadium Auto Mall.  Stadium Auto Mall.  All you need to buy a new car or truck is a pen.  That's it.  You don't need money.  Go down there.  No down payment.  No security deposit.  No payments until 2002.  You know what you do? 
[02:43:30]  You just steal it.  I'm kidding.  Stop.  Don't look at me like that.  No, you don't need money.  Choose from over 10 acres of brand new Fords, Jeeps, Chryslers, Daewoo's, even used cars  and trucks, but please leave your money at home.  That's right.  No payments until 2002.  And don't worry about bad credit.  Stadium Auto Mall finances everyone.  Or Stadium pays you $1,000 in cash.  Why the hell they do this?  Why wait until next year to get the car, truck, or SUV you want?  Stadium Auto Mall lets you buy now and pay later.  Much later, like 2002 later. 
[02:44:00]  No down payment.  No security deposit.  No payments until 2002.  And guaranteed financing for everyone.  Only at the incredible Stadium Auto Mall.  Route 17 North, Rutherford, New Jersey.  Call them up.  201-935-2400.  201-935-2400 for Stadium Auto Mall.  Break it down.  Please, wow.  We love seeing boobs.  Please, wow.  Love it.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everybody can run around the street.  Yeah, close up.  We're from Rouse Wednesday.  A brilliant idea. 
[02:44:30]  Swim, me.  There's the cure for cancer.  You're ignorant.  Yes.  O.B. and Anthony.  Just a few minutes left of the show.  Did you hear that going on in the last bit of commercial?  Yeah, now pilots are falling asleep in the sky.  Terror in the sky or something now.  The news is saying, the pilots are sleeping in the cockpit.  They do that. 
[02:45:00]  Another killer tease.  Wow.  I'm sure they know which airlines have the pilots that are sleeping.  You know something?  It's totally fine.  On long flights, a lot of times, the captain...  That's why we got feeders now.  ...the first officer can sleep during the flight.  They're allowed to.  As long as the other guy is in control of the plane.  The planes are computerized.  They don't even fly them.  Yeah.  I would feel a little better, though, if the pilots stayed awake.  I don't care if the computers are doing all the work.  On a flight from, let's say, L.A. to Australia, you wouldn't want maybe somebody snoozing up in the cockpit to take over? 
[02:45:30]  Put an extra 70 pounds on your girlfriend.  I need two pilots awake at the same time.  You need two awake at the same time.  Yeah, because what if one is sleeping and then the guy that's awake all of a sudden has a heart attack or an aneurysm or something?  Well, you get more than...  On the long flights, you get more than just two guys.  I don't even like when the pilot goes to the bathroom, because I'm like, oh, my God, what if the door locks or something, and the other guy has the aneurysm in the cockpit? 
[02:46:00]  Then you've got to fly.  No, but when you said it's true, it's the only time the pilots are really in charge is during takeoff and landing, and the rest of the time it is electronically.  Yeah, but all right, then why don't they just, you know, send them some letters while the plane's flying.  Send them without pilots, send them without pilots.  They tried that.  You didn't see the show where the plane flew into the trees.  It was completely computerized.  Oh, yeah, that was a nasty one.  I don't care if it's computerized.  You want a human being on your plane.  You need the pilot to take off and landing, or else you just go into the sun. 
[02:46:30]  You need...  That's funny, yeah.  Is the pilot eating lettuce, truthfully?  Pilots taking baths in Tub of Terror as they're eating bad lettuce and sleeping in the cockpit.  All this horror as they fall out of the sky on your head.  Tub of Terror.  Tub of Terror.  Tub of Terror.  Oh, my God.  Wasn't that an attraction at Action Park?  Yeah, it should be.  The Tub of Terror.  Attraction.  Traction Park.  Traction Park.  Accident Park.  All right.  Well, we should play What Do We Learn and get the hell out of here, huh? 
[02:47:00]  Yes, I believe it was semi-educational today.  I had a lot of fun.  I want to thank Otto and George and Joe for stopping by.  I learned that that guy Tony is a jerk-off.  Oh, don't let these guys get to you.  Nah.  They joke because they love.  Yeah.  I hope.  Otto and George playing with Jim Norton and Rich Voss tomorrow night at Rascals in West Orange.  It really is going to be a great show.  If you can't have that one, you know, Stress Factory on the 20th, guys.  Come down.  Beautiful.  Right on.  Thank you, guys.  No problem. 
[02:47:30]  Anytime.  See you.  I love Pooza!  Yes, thank you, Pooza!  George, have fun today.  Oh, man.  I love being here.  I also like bus pumes.  Speaking of bus pumes, we're going through the Lincoln Tunnel, so in horror, horror.  Oh.  Yeah, they've got to pump some fresh air into those tunnels.  It's getting bad.  It's getting bad.  Dylan!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Lynn.  Syndication Underground from South Africa.  I learned black guys drowning look like lentil soup.  Are you really in South Africa? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, no, I'm in South Africa.  You're calling us from South Africa.  Wow.  Uh-huh.  Doesn't that cost a lot?  Oh, yeah, but I've got a phone card, you know.  South Africa.  Syndication International.  There would be some kind of, yeah, you're right.  Yeah, more of a delay on the line, like when they talk to Iraq or something.  It's like a whole process thing, how I got that, because I don't really know anybody,  so I got my friend to put, like, a computer up to the, like, computer.  No, we're talking a delay, not only in the computer, but in the phone call.  You ever see when they were talking to the people in Iraq, and they'd be like, 
[02:48:30]  how is it, how is the bombing going?  Have you heard about the reports from our pilots?  Oh, yeah.  You know what Tarzan's whole name is?  Huh?  Yeah, what?  I don't know.  Deal?  You know what Jane's whole name is?  Pusser!  Jane's whole name.  Get it, stupid?  Get a phone call.  All right, later, guys.  All right.  All right.  I don't think he's calling from South Africa.  Now, that just sounds a little fishy, right, son?  I'll give you $1,000. 
[02:49:00]  South Bronx.  Jason.  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Got two things.  Yes.  One, Moojohn's name is...  Yes.  And my friend told me about this tour bus going around in Well Stickers.  What's the deal with that?  Friday.  Friday.  We'll have all the details tomorrow.  All right, cool.  Thanks.  All right, then.  Bye.  Let's go to Donald.  Donald, what's up?  Donald, hey.  Yeah, how are you?  Hey.  I learned that.  Very nice.  She's hanging out with Big Pussy.  Very nice.  Now I go.  All right, you do have to go. 
[02:49:30]  Carolyn.  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that Opie can't pronounce aneurysm.  Did I say it wrong?  I don't know.  That's a little strange, okay?  The nature of men.  I have a feeling for her that if they were two, you know, hot 17-year-olds or two hot 20-year-old  guys, she still would have hated it.  What are you, a fag hag?  Well...  Are you a fag hag?  You like hanging out with the gay guys?  I wouldn't say hanging out, but, you know, as much as you guys like to watch the two  women, there are those of us who like to watch the two men.  That's a lot. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  We talked about that.  If we took a poll, there's not many women like you that would enjoy seeing two guys getting  it on.  They're out there, but not as many as men that like the two women thing.  I like to watch two women, Dice Clay and Jim Norton.  Shallow, skank, hang up.  All right, Carol.  Thank you.  Hate-mongering.  Thank you.  The nature of men.  We're full of anger.  Hate-mongering.  Eric, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Today I learned that tall girls have long hot pockets.  Yes, long hot pockets.  I learned that Anne's afraid of the BET network. 
[02:50:30]  Stinky, roll a joint, man.  Yeah, definitely.  Damn him.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Peace.  Take some kidding.  Today I learned Kamal's still not funny.  Oh.  Today I learned that the next time Grandma complains about being constipated, I will take her to  Traction Park.  Josh from Jersey.  Today I learned that Anthony measures the weight of fat girls using ballpark.  Yeah.  That was funny.  Let me go to Tom here.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, I learned what kind of a bathtub killed babies. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, wait.  I didn't learn that, those bastards.  Yeah, no ass.  Tell us which bit.  Printer.  I know.  Come on.  I know I'm not going to fly.  I'm not going to wash my kids.  I'm not going to eat lettuce.  Come on, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Rock on.  UPN.  I sugar.  Ernie, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey.  Today I learned that as soon as I hang up, George is going to make fun of me.  Ernie-O, how are you?  How are you doing, George?  Not too bad.  Better since you asked.  Hey, Ann?  Yes. 
[02:51:30]  How's your dresser?  Very good.  Very good.  How's your dresser?  That means you guys suck.  Oh.  Brad, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  I learned that two boogies are silent black in the background.  Yeah.  He didn't say much, but he gave us some great new remixes today.  Yeah.  Right on.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys roll.  Bye.  All right.  I guess it wasn't that educational a show today.  There wasn't much being learned this afternoon.  Not like yesterday's physics lesson.  The physics was good yesterday. 
[02:52:00]  At least it was something someone learned.  How fast was that guy going?  Did you ever come up with the actual figures?  In the three-second fall at just under 65 miles an hour.  65 miles an hour.  Really?  Yeah.  And he lived.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he lived.  No broken bones, nothing.  Wow.  I learned today that if you spread a fat chick's legs far enough apart, you could see her grandchildren's  fetus.  Feet?  Not fetus?  Well, then he wasn't listening.  Much funnier with feet.  Feet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A true comic. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Feetus.  All right.  I'm trying to find more.  What did we learn?  No one learned anything.  Go over, Johnny.  Today I learned that Otto has to check out your package before he'll work with you.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  He was from Jersey.  Jim from Jersey learned that gay midgets AF instead of F.  Right.  That was earlier in the show.  Today I learned that kids jump off anything with a ladder connected.  I learned E. coli's no big deal.  You could just walk it off. 
[02:53:00]  You're not a pooha.  I learned Rich Voss has cheese behind the ears.  All right.  That is gross.  He does that?  Yeah.  Filthy Joe.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  Otto, George.  Thank you.  Joe.  Thank you.  Don't forget.  So much joy you bring to the world with your comedy show.  What a boogie, of course.  And Drew Boogie, of course.  Nice to meet you.  One more plug, though, for out on George playing with Jim Morton. 
[02:53:30]  Jim Morton.  Jim Norton.  I got to go home, man.  Rich Voss.  Jim Mosen.  West Orange tomorrow night.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  I'm going to start developing my comedy show.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Dennis.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. </pre>
