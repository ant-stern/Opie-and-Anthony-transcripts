<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a nonsensical song and a boisterous announcement of their return to New York radio, mentioning their record-breaking FCC fine stemming from a 2002 sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The hosts, using highly offensive language throughout the broadcast, immediately dove into listener feedback, focusing on "hate music" from the racist Panzerfaust record label.  They debated the humor in the offensive lyrics, despite acknowledging the hateful nature of the songs.  The conversation veered into discussions of Robert Englund's sexuality,  the practice of Hollywood celebrities staying closeted until their careers were established (using Rosie O'Donnell as an example), and a recurring joke about a picture of Marlon Brando and Wally Cox. A caller praised the show's variety, prompting the hosts to compare their improved dynamic to their syndicated show, highlighting their reduced complaining.  They expressed frustration with XM Satellite Radio's perceived lack of support and accused Howard Stern of sabotage, believing their show to be superior. One host shared a disturbing experience with a masseuse.  The discussion then shifted to Joel Hollander, a radio executive who admired them and revealed WNEW's significant financial losses after their firing.  The Panzerfaust music, including a song titled "Shit Dick" listing celebrities, was revisited, followed by commentary on one host's flamboyant clothing style (flaming shirts and boots).  They then moved to a rant about a drunk driving accident on the Belt Parkway, before mentioning an upcoming segment with Tony Danza. A vulgar parody of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" was played.  The segment concluded with discussions of personal lives—one host's maid experience, another's preference for cleanliness contrasting their messy studio, and their upbringings.  Throughout, highly offensive and vulgar language was prevalent.

The next segment centered on two main topics: a caller's experience with a new housekeeper (described with offensive language regarding her appearance and work ethic) and the hosts' ongoing prank calls targeting the Tony Danza show.  The caller detailed his discomfort and attempts to avoid the housekeeper, along with humorous descriptions of his messy apartment.  The hosts discussed their pranks, including impersonating Danza, analyzing excessive audience applause, and a recent incident involving security and potential police involvement. They also discussed the fallout, including the disruption of their message boards by listeners.  The segment included several "racist silly songs,"  in-studio guests Danny the intern (who gave Jimmy Norton an apple) and Nikki Kimbrough, and a caller, Rob, who detailed his success distributing "WoW" stickers.


A phone interview with Byron, founder of Panzer Faust, followed.  The hosts played several songs, debating the nature of the music and Byron’s views.  Byron defended his music by comparing it to aggressive rap lyrics, arguing a double standard based on race. He discussed his white power beliefs and experiences, including time in Africa and involvement in the movement since age 17.  The hosts challenged his views, engaging in a debate about racism, multiculturalism, and the impact of hate speech.  Humorous bits included a phone call mimicking a request for "butt plugs" and more Panzer Faust songs.  Listeners called in to share their reactions.


The show then featured a caller, Carrie, claiming improbable measurements (5'3", 112 pounds, 38DD). The hosts, using crude language, questioned the plausibility, speculating about breast implants. Carrie confirmed the implants were the result of a breakup.  The hosts continued teasing her about her weight and appearance.  Other callers joined, escalating the humorous back-and-forth about her weight.  This transitioned into the "Guess What's in My Pants" game, where Carrie used her phone to create sounds by rubbing it on her genitals for the hosts to guess her pubic hair style.  The segment unexpectedly included an interview with James Remar, focusing on his film roles, including some banter about *Sex and the City*.  After the interview, the "Guess What's in My Pants" game resumed with sexually suggestive dialogue.  The segment concluded with more discussion of Carrie, interspersed with banter, XM Radio ads, a bizarre call about a car accident (in Disneyland and on Jupiter), and a humorous exchange with a customer service representative.

The final segment featured Jeff Timmons (98 Degrees) discussing his divorce, his new solo career, and lip-syncing in the music industry (using Britney Spears and Janet Jackson as examples).  Lee Abrams, a high-ranking XM Satellite Radio executive, then joined, discussing his career, radio formats, and his passion for flying (including a humorous anecdote about Morgan Freeman). Abrams criticized contemporary radio clichés. The show concluded with callers sharing vulgar, sexually suggestive, and racially charged responses to what they learned from the show, followed by an XM Radio and Major League Baseball advertisement.

[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, let's see what we got here.  I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story.  And I need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony. We're back live in New York. 
[00:07:30]  Pay attention. They spark controversy.  Fuck you!  Being able to do the show we want to do.  Hold on tight, kids.  Jesus fucking Christ!  One of the biggest fines in FCC history has slapped against Opie and Anthony.  You got a couple of great guys over there.  Opie and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money.  Yay, bitch!  Hold a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, right?  Yeah, we have. We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the pass party.  Get your cock out. 
[00:08:00]  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for both people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls.  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  V.O.B. and Anthony's show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocks, fucker, motherfucker, and tits.  V.O.B. and Anthony's show. 
[00:08:30]  That's my new favorite thing. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  The pissed off southern guy that called the F.U. line.  V.O.B. and Anthony's show.  V.O.B. and Anthony's show.  What the hell is that?  I don't know, but it makes me chuckle.  Chuckle.  Good morning, and welcome to the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[00:09:30]  Hola.  A big hi to everyone sampling the O.B. and Anthony show this week.  Sampling?  Sampling.  Well, we got the free play, you know?  Oh, that's right.  You're listening to the O.B. and Anthony free play all week long on XM202.  To continue to receive Channel 202 on your XM radio, you'll need to add O.B. and Anthony  to your XM account.  You can do that by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO, or you can subscribe online.  And we're hearing from a lot of the people that have checked out the show the last couple 
[00:10:00]  days, and they're digging it, huh?  Yes, they are.  And they're signing up already.  That's pretty cool, because this show, it's kind of, that's why we call it a virus.  Yeah.  It kind of comes upon you slowly but surely, and all of a sudden, one day you wake up  and you're infected.  Like, I have to listen to these guys.  You have it.  And a lot of times, you don't even know why.  We don't even know why.  It starts as a little scratch at the back of your throat, and you don't even think about  it, and then, uh-oh, I've got it.  You got it.  I think I'm sick.  Yeah.  You know?  We just don't know why people listen to us at times. 
[00:10:30]  Really?  Yeah.  There you go.  You're hearing something that I'm not hearing.  But my ears are shot.  And you know what it is?  It has nothing to do with what's going out over the air.  It's what's in my earphones.  Oh, really?  Like, I can't hear me, but if I turn it up too loud, so I can hear me like I like to  hear me in the headphones, then everyone else is just booming.  So, that's perfect.  Do you have a headphone volume over there?  Yeah, but it doesn't, it, see, if I turned it up where I was comfortable hearing  myself in my headphones, everyone else is booming too loud.  Okay.  But that's perfect. 
[00:11:00]  There you have it.  So, where were we?  Huh?  This is this.  I know.  This or this.  This or this.  This.  I know.  We did that yesterday.  I like this.  Hmm.  So, yeah, we don't know why people listen.  We're being honest with you.  Yeah.  There's something about the show.  It's some, I don't know, it's a soap opera at times.  The collection of dopey characters that are completely, every day, getting either shit on  or shitting on other people.  Yes.  It seems to be the, it seems to be the way the show goes on a daily basis. 
[00:11:30]  Speaking of shit.  Hmm.  Were you singing shit dick all night long?  Oh, who wasn't?  Who wasn't?  I don't even know how to explain that.  What a great little ditty.  It really is.  But are we so, I don't even know, are we supposed to be pissed off at these songs?  No.  We went into it going, wow, this guy's a real ass and we're going to, we're going to give  him the business.  I think we're finally talking to the guy today.  Are we?  Yeah, he's the owner of this, I know this sounds bad, I don't know how else to explain, but 
[00:12:00]  he's the owner of this really racist record company.  Panzerfaust.  Yeah, so we, so we get the songs and, and we, you know, we throw them in the CD player  and Anthony and I are like, wow, all right, let's get all pissed off, you know what I  mean?  Yeah, it's, it's hate music.  But they're, they're catchy.  They're catchy, thank you.  I don't know what to say.  Bastard.  Because I, you know, in print, this isn't going to sound good when they go, Opie and  Anthony, you know.  What are you going to say?  They're catchy.  It, it, if they, if they had different lyrics to them, it would be just as good, you know 
[00:12:30]  what I mean?  Like, uh, you know, the music's catchy and how they put these songs together is catchy,  but the lyrics are very hateful.  So, you know, it's, it's not a good thing.  This is pretty dangerous, I think, you know, if he's handing it out at schools like they said  they are, because it is catchy.  If it just stunk, no one would want to listen to it, but.  Yeah, if it was more of that stuff you hear on, like, liquid metal. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, nasty.  But it's, uh.  So we throw these.  Oh, Tapper.  We throw these songs in and, and all of a sudden we find ourselves laughing.  Yeah.  And I, you know, I know it's wrong.  I know it's wrong to laugh, but I'm still going to laugh because I find it funny.  Of course.  On some kind of level.  Very funny.  So the phones exploded as soon as we got here, like, hey, how about you guys start  the show with one of those songs?  Oh.  And I think this is the one that's, like, sweeping the nation.  Shit dick.  Yeah.  I can see Casey, well, Casey Kasem doesn't do the top 40 anymore. 
[00:13:30]  He doesn't do them anywhere, but coming in at number two.  It's shit dick.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  And now a long-distance dedication to some flaming faggot.  This one's called shit dick.  And then yesterday we're, we're playing the song on the air and one of the names they mentioned,  we all got really surprised.  Not that it matters, but we found out that Freddy Krueger's gay.  You know, what happened there?  I, I, I never heard that.  We've had Freddy on the show. 
[00:14:00]  He's, he's a great guy.  Freddy, did we have Freddy or Robert Englund?  Robert Englund on the show.  And, uh, he's a great guy.  We had a lot of fun with him and, and we were very surprised.  But then our faithful listeners, it was all over whackbag.com overnight, uh, did some research.  And, yes, Robert Englund is indeed gay.  And I guess-  Where did that info come from?  How did the message board do research?  They found it on his website.  It's pretty easy, I guess.  Really?  And then some old articles where he admits it.  And supposedly he was gay before he did all the, uh, Friday the 13th movies. 
[00:14:30]  Well, it's not like you turn gay at that age.  No, I know.  But I mean, he, yeah, you're right.  I mean, but he-  That's funny.  He already told everyone he was before.  Oh, he did?  Yeah, a lot of these actors, like, you know, uh, Halford.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, they're not gonna come out of the closet until they make their cash.  Right.  Most people in Hollywood don't come out of the closet until they make their cash.  But everyone in Hollywood knows, but they kind of keep it a secret, you know?  Right.  And then they come out of the closet.  Rosie O'Donnell's a perfect example.  She did that stupid TV show for years, you know, claiming that she had a crush on Tom 
[00:15:00]  Cruise and every other, quote, hunk that came on her TV show.  That's so all the rubes in the Midwest wouldn't go, oh, I don't want to listen to no lesbian.  I ain't listen to a dyke.  Right.  And then as soon as, uh, the TV show was, um, on its way out, then she finally has no  problem admitting that she's been a lesbian her whole life.  The razor comes out and she's shaved half her head.  I have no respect for her.  Ugh.  None.  And then, and it's done in Hollywood all the time.  Mm-hmm.  All the time.  Rock Hudson, people knew he was gay in Hollywood, but no one, uh, no one uttered a peep about 
[00:15:30]  it.  Right.  And no one knew he was gay until, uh, they showed him at that news conference where he weighed  20 pounds right before he dropped dead.  And Marlon Brando is a shit dick.  Stop it.  No.  Marlon Brando had some, I think he was a part-time shit dick.  Oh, just a part-timer?  I think half his dipstick.  There's a, there's a, a legendary, there's a, there's a famous picture of Marlon Brando,  you know, sucking.  Hobbing Knob.  Hobbing Knob. 
[00:16:00]  Of the guy who did the voice of, uh, Mighty Mouse.  Underdog.  Underdog.  Underdog.  Yeah.  Underdog.  Do we have that bit?  Hold on a minute.  All right.  Underdog.  Do we have that on our CD, actually?  It's, I think it's a quickie.  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This.  I don't even know if this is funny anymore, but.  Oh.  Very, very early in our career, isn't it?  Very dated.  Very dated.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  It's so dated, it doesn't want to queue up on the CD player.  Here it is.  Really fast, really fast. 
[00:16:30]  Hi AF.  Hey, what's up?  You guys did a bit a couple of weeks ago about Wally Cox and Marlon Brando, and I just wanted  you guys to do that one again.  That was so funny.  You know the story, right?  Oh, yeah.  Wally and Marlon were roommates in the 50s or something, and somebody snapped a picture  of Marlon doing something that the Godfather shouldn't do.  Exactly.  And by the way, that picture is in Penthouse.  Oh, yeah, this month.  And Wally Cox was the voice of Underdog.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you guys are great. 
[00:17:00]  Underdog, Underdog, come here.  I want to satisfy you.  Here, let me kneel down in front of you, mild-mannered shoeshine boy.  Here, let me buff something for you.  You clean my shoes, I'll buff something for you.  When Marlon kneels, I am not slow.  He opens his mouth, and away I go.  All right, all right.  You guys go.  All right, there it is.  Just a quickie.  Now, I know it's the nightmare on Elm Street movies.  I messed up with them.  Oh, what did you say?  I think I said Friday the 13th. 
[00:17:30]  Really?  Dude, we're barely awake this time of the morning.  Just enjoy.  I didn't even notice.  Fill in all the mistakes, you know.  Trust me.  The guy goes, okay, marshmallow ass.  He's going to, like, throw in a little dig at you, Opie.  That's okay.  I can sort of handle it.  I can handle it better than Rich Voss.  Matt from Jersey.  What's up, Matt?  Gentlemen, good morning.  Good morning.  I just wanted to say a quick comment on you guys were talking about, you know, why anybody 
[00:18:00]  listens.  I mean, it's new.  Every day is something different.  It's not the same old boring crap.  You know, you guys are always doing something to make you crack up, you know, and I just  wanted to tell everybody just to friggin' spend the two freakin' dollars.  Don't be so cheap.  And you know what?  This new show, I like this new show a lot better than WNEW's version when we were syndicated  to about 20 cities. 
[00:18:30]  We don't bitch as much, you know?  Really?  We really don't.  Wow, we must have bitched a lot then.  Oh, we were bitching every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  And, you know, we bitched at first when we first got here because it was very frustrating  to try to figure out all the new equipment and the new players here and stuff.  Yeah.  I personally don't bitch as much.  No, you have, I don't know, you're a little different than you were at any W.  I have noticed.  I don't see Opie really throwing things.  You know, when you have-  Aside from the poker chip episode. 
[00:19:00]  And I didn't have it in me.  Your heart wasn't really in it?  Not really, you know?  I kind of-  But you used to really, like, kick things around.  Oh, yeah.  I would have thrown the poker chips through the window at the old place.  Now it's like, ah, people expect it.  So, all right, I'll give him a little bone every once in a while.  I'll play Stairway to Heaven every once in a while.  Give him the hit.  I got the FU money now.  I don't care.  Oh.  We're just calling it in now.  Oh, God.  But he's like, but you kind of like me better now. 
[00:19:30]  Well, I-  Before the show, Norton was losing his mind.  And Norton ran out of the studio, really pissed off because, well, you know, I guess we  can mention this part of it.  They had a spokesperson from XM Satellite Radio on Fox.  Yeah.  And he was mentioning how great the company was, but he failed to mention Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Which really just pissed off Norton to no end.  He was on Neil Cavuto's show on Fox.  And Cavuto pretty much set him up with a perfect lob ball to mention our show. 
[00:20:00]  You know, he mentions the Doggy Company and Howard and football and baseball and, you  know, NASCAR and kind of asked him what, you know, what does XM have to offer as far  as personality radio goes?  And the guy just, you know, he's a perfect opportunity.  He said content on premium channels or something like that.  That's the closest he got.  That's the closest he got.  Content on premium channels. 
[00:20:30]  Just didn't want to mention you.  That's all.  Yeah.  So Norton's watching the piece and just absolutely loses his mind.  Oh, my God.  Just starts pounding papers on the counter and kicking stuff.  Looked like a monkey with Samsonite luggage.  Kicking stuff.  And just, you know, storms out of the studio.  And I'm just chuckling.  Throwing his feces against the wall.  I'm just laughing.  And I go, Anthony, have you noticed something?  I'm like, Norton is taking over for me.  Yeah.  He's losing his mind.  And I'm just sitting here calmly, just drinking my green tea, getting ready for today's show.  And I pointed at the seat that Norton was no longer in and the mess that was around it. 
[00:21:00]  And I said, Opie, that was you.  That's exactly.  That's what you looked like.  And that's exactly how it looked when you lost your mind.  When you used to lose your mind.  It's almost like I came out of a coma and I lost some of my brain activity.  And you're slowly but surely telling me how I used to be.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like a beaten dog after, like, electroshock treatment.  Just completely different.  I'm coming back to life slowly but surely.  But it's good to see that someone else has taken up the cause.  Yeah, I know.  It was refreshing.  I used to be the guy when, you know, we're talking to management with conference calls. 
[00:21:30]  I'd be yelling and screaming, turning red.  Uh-huh.  You know, and now I just sit there and kind of just nod my head.  Nod your head.  Yeah, whatever.  Because it's all the shit we've heard a million times.  And now it's Norton that is taking control and taking up the passion.  And losing his mind.  Losing his mind.  Premium content.  Yeah, no, I know.  I mean, as long as we're on here.  Premium content.  That's really all that matters.  You know, I'm not going to lie.  It's really frustrating that we're not getting the full support from the company yet. 
[00:22:00]  I understand this is an uphill battle.  I understand we messed up so bad with the sex and the church thing that there's probably a lot of people that work for XM Satellite Radio  that still aren't that comfortable with this radio show being on the platform, unfortunately.  Well, they don't like us, yes.  But the reality is this show is so much better than Howard Stern.  It's not even funny.  It's not even funny.  That guy just bitches and complains every single day.  He's not doing anything funny or creative.  No, no.  Thought-provoking.  He doesn't have you really reacting anymore.  He has people turning off the show because they're sick of hearing him bitch day in and day out. 
[00:22:30]  Years ago, very funny.  Now, it's just a bitch fest that goes on and on and on.  And, yeah, that's a great thing to do to the faithful listeners that have been with you.  Sit there and bitch, hoping they throw you out of your deal, which they're not going to do, by the way.  No, no, no.  It just seems like they're just going to milk him for every buck he's worth.  But so then you just turn on your listeners and give them a crappy product?  Is that what you do? 
[00:23:00]  I guess it is.  Right.  So, you know, I know this is the better show.  No doubt in my mind.  And it's up to XM Sally Radio to expose this show to as many people as possible.  And then we will win the battle.  No problem.  It'll be a cakewalk.  It'll be simple.  But the challenge we have is getting this show to as many people as possible.  Yep.  So when you see a spokesperson on Fox pretty much blowing us off, it is disheartening.  It really is.  You know, you had a perfect opportunity to say, oh, no, we have Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:30]  And the company truly believes that it's the better show and much funnier and much more entertaining than stupid Howard Stern.  Howard knows we're better.  He knows it.  He shut us up.  The guy had us shut up.  And we had no choice.  We had to take it.  It was either that or we were going to get fired.  So he went behind the scenes and made sure we shut up.  Yeah.  If he wasn't threatened, he would do what he does to other jocks that suck.  You know, bash him, talk about him, and turn his audience against them. 
[00:24:00]  As soon as we got to XM Sally Radio, we started bashing him hard, hard, hard, hard.  He had nothing to say.  Because he can't compete on this level.  The day we got the boot, he had plenty to say.  Talking about us.  Because he knew we didn't have a voice.  We didn't have a voice.  We didn't have microphones at that point.  So he thought it was safe to tell everyone how he felt about us and trash us.  Ooh, wow.  That's so brave, Howard.  So brave.  Did he mention you by name when you got fired? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  I had no problem at that point.  Maybe they should have him be a spokesman for XM when they're talking about what content you have.  Hey, Imus mentioned us yesterday.  He's proud of us.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He said some nice things about us.  A couple of stupid idiots is what they are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.  So without trashing the guy that was on TV, it's definitely disheartening that he just blows us off like we're not even here.  That's good business.  Better business.  I know we effed up.  I know we effed up bad, and this is going to be a slow build.  I understand that.  That's why we say almost every morning that you're witnessing, hopefully, the greatest comeback in radio history. 
[00:25:00]  We were on top of the world, and then we were pretty much shown the door for two and a half years.  And now we have to start over, you know?  Wasn't that fun?  But every day, the show's getting better and better.  More gooder, I like to say.  More gooder, and this is the better show.  This is the better show, and we will prove that.  If we have to do it ourselves, we will prove that.  We will have to do it ourselves.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a little disheartening. 
[00:25:30]  That just makes me physically ill.  Just a tad.  But if I could chime in with somebody else that made me physically ill.  Yes, Jimmy?  Because you all know my tribulations.  I haven't slept in three days.  That's why I'm really, really foul.  Are you really tired and in a bad, cranky mood?  Oh, I want to bite somebody's face.  I mean, I'm just like, I can't.  I'm trying to sleep.  I'm laying there for, I'm just laying there, and I'm not sleeping.  The last night, I figured a nice massage.  I've been laying off the horse, but if someone's massaging you, well, that's just helpful.  So, and your massages, don't let people be disillusioned here. 
[00:26:00]  Your massages do include a happy ending.  All massages do.  Yes, all massages do.  Not when I get a massage.  It does.  I get a real massage.  No, I'm telling you the truth.  There's no such thing as a real massage.  Even in the Yankee locker room, when someone pulls a hamstring, there's got to be a happy ending.  By the way, you were swearing off hookers, and you lasted a week, and now I think you're up to four days in a row with some kind of, quote, hooker-type person.  Whether it's a massager or whatever.  What have you.  He's tired.  Mutually beneficial friend.  He's tired. 
[00:26:30]  He's got to, you know, he's got to relax.  He's got to relax.  So she's massaging me, and then she turns me over, and she's kind of rubbing her breasts over me, and it was kind of sexy.  They were like those, like, B-cups that kind of hang a little bit, like little cones.  And I'm teasing the nips.  Looking like funnels.  Yes, absolutely.  And in the right one, as I'm playing, there was a golf ball-sized lump in the right breast. 
[00:27:00]  Where did you find these girls?  Oh, my God, really.  Dude, it was awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Oh, wow.  Sorry, people at home.  I didn't say it was a sexy, funny story.  That kind of takes you right out of it, doesn't it?  No.  No.  How much did you have to pay for old tumor breasts?  Yeah, where'd that run you?  One fist for the massage.  One fitty.  That's funny.  Wig not included.  Wig not included. 
[00:27:30]  One fitty.  What a nightmare.  Did she win the form her?  How do you not notice that?  I could see if it was a little, you know, a goiter the size of a retarded kid's head.  How did she not feel that?  Yeah.  She had to know it.  The black power fist in her breast.  Oh, my God.  And, you know, NASCAR and premium content.  All right.  Relax.  Going backwards, yeah.  Someone just reminded me on the instant feedback that Joel Hollander, Anthony, was talking about  Viacom and Howard going to satellite radio. 
[00:28:00]  I'm a big fan of Joel Hollander.  Joel Hollander, it's a fact, loves Opie and Anthony.  He's a radio genius.  Absolutely loves Opie and Anthony.  I actually, I guess I could say this now, in early spring, I happened to bump into him  on 57th Street when Bob Eatman was in town, our super agent, who's not that super, but  he's still our super agent.  He's being pretty lazy himself.  He needs to work a little harder to get us some more exposure.  Anyway, because he listens to this every day, so no, and we mean this one, Bob. 
[00:28:30]  This isn't a radio bit.  57th Street, so we bump into Joel Hollander.  Just, how's Anthony?  How you doing?  You know, it's BS.  What happened to you guys?  It was before I was at the company.  I think I could have, you know, saved you guys and, you know, got through it.  He goes, I would hire you guys tomorrow if I could.  Yeah.  He said that.  This was in early spring.  He goes, but the climate and everything, but let's keep in touch.  You never know what's going to happen down the road. 
[00:29:00]  I like Joel Hollander.  Joel Hollander is a stand-up guy.  He's the guy, when we first went to WNAW, came back, you know, to New York from Boston  after we got fired up there, he wanted to syndicate us immediately.  Yeah.  And it took the company, the company that, the rest of the guys in the company, you know,  they didn't really believe in us.  They just didn't.  They threw a boatload of money at us because they didn't want us competing against Howard.  That's a fact, too.  Yeah.  You know, Mel never really believed in us, but he knew he's not a stupid guy. 
[00:29:30]  He'd rather, like, you know, have us working for him than across the street.  Yeah.  You know, Mel only takes care of Howard.  That's a fact.  That's it.  That's an absolute fact.  So all those people at the little doggy company that think, you know, Mel's going to  make their careers, wrong.  Oh, whenever you heard that whole thing, Mel is a huge fan of talent.  No, Mel's a huge fan of Howard.  Howard, everyone else gets shit on.  Right.  That's pretty much it.  And he makes sure no one else gets big so Howard continues to be this huge, massive douchebag.  That's it.  So Joel Hollander, when we first got to New York, wanted to syndicate us immediately, 
[00:30:00]  but the rest of the company's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  And then finally they couldn't ignore us anymore because we were ready to go to Q104 to do  mornings up against Howard for Clear Channel.  And, wow, I can't believe this is all coming out, but fuck it.  And then, you know, then they had to make the huge deal and give us exactly what we wanted,  which was syndication across the country and a lot more money.  They were paying us nothing when we first moved to New York.  We blackmailed them.  So, yeah, then we got fired for the Sex with Sam thing, and Joel was talking about all sorts 
[00:30:30]  of stuff yesterday, and he mentions at the bottom here, he mentions our old station, WNEW  New York, and he revealed that the station was losing millions of dollars after afternoon  hosts Opie and Anthony were fired.  Yes.  That's one station.  Millions of dollars on one station because the company decided to fire us, which was the  stupidest move in radio history.  We could have got through that, but that's okay.  We're moving on, and we're happy to be here.  Right. 
[00:31:00]  Happy to be here.  Millions of dollars, one station.  We were on 20.  We were 17, I think, by the time we lost our job.  Yeah.  There you go.  And Joel had nothing to do with that.  Absolutely nothing.  No.  He wasn't in charge back then.  Joel was a smart, radio-savvy guy.  It was stupid John Sykes who was going to get fired any day, by the way.  What?  I still have a lot of friends over there.  I know all this crap.  Oh, inside info, yes.  Anyway, we were talking about shit dick. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  You want to start the show with a little racist rock and roll, Anthony?  Oh, God.  So, where were we?  We went off on a 20-minute tangent here.  I know.  Well, we were talking about the record that Panzerfaust, record label sent a Panzerfaust.  I use a Panzerfaust in Battlefield 1942, a video game.  It's a small little bazooka that takes out tanks, Opie.  Right, right.  And they call their record label Panzerfaust.  And they have hate music. 
[00:32:00]  It's rock music with hateful lyrics to Jewish people, gays, black people.  What other groups do they hate?  White people who emulate the actions and diction of black people.  Right, whiggers, they call them.  Did you mention a towel is not a hat?  Oh, right, right.  A towel is not a hat, which is an ode to the Middle Easterners.  The Arabs.  The Arabs.  A towel is not a hat. 
[00:32:30]  I wonder if they're Queen fans.  Oh, perhaps.  We do have a couple new songs today.  Yes, we do.  Which we will play in a little while.  We're going to talk to the guy in a little while, too.  Really?  Yeah.  It's going to be a weird interview because, you know, it's obvious.  I don't know.  I love getting into the heads of these guys, though.  I want to hear his whole ideology and stuff.  Yeah.  I hear where this comes from.  Why is he so pissed off?  See, I'm looking at these songs.  I hate to say it.  They're just funny.  They're really funny.  I mean, they're completely wrong. 
[00:33:00]  Yes, they're wrong, but they're funny.  Yeah.  Well, we've always been into the darker side of humor on this show, so when you listen  to it, it's wrong, but, you know, it is kind of funny.  And then our message board just went nuts over this one song, this shit dick song.  Shit dick.  So I guess we're going to rock out to shit dick.  That's against the gay people.  It's a derogatory term for the gay people.  Thinking they have anal sex all the time, Opie.  That's what I'm guessing.  Here we go. 
[00:33:30]  Check this out.  We hate all shit dicks.  We hate all shit dicks.  Andy Warhol.  Shit dicks.  Mick Jagger.  Jager.  Shit dicks. 
[00:34:00]  Michael Jackson.  Shit dicks.  Shit dicks.  Jeffery Dahmer.  Cannibal.  Shit dicks.  Shit dicks.  We hate shit dicks.  We hate shit dicks.  But slamming tit dicks.  Boy George.  Shit dicks.  Freddy Mercury.  Shit dicks.  David Bowie.  Shit dicks.  Shit dicks.  Sicher dicks.  Okay.  Shit dicks. uins.  Freddie Mercury  David Bowie 
[00:34:30]  Rob  Helper  Judas Priest  SHITTER  SHITTER  Rock Hudson  Liberace  Tim neighbor  Robert Englund  Freddy Krueger  Finn Fox  SHITTER 
[00:35:00]  Truman Capote  SHITTER  Richard Simmons  SHITTER  Rod Stewart  SHITTER  Richard Gere  PUT  DURBULING SHITTER  WE AIN'T THE FUNKING SHITTER  PUNKING SHITTER  YOU'RE SICK  SICK 
[00:35:30]  SICK  I don't mean to laugh, but it's just so...  It's so wrong and so catchy at the same time.  You just, you find yourself singing that one.  I was just walking around my apartment yesterday.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da...  That song could just as easily be called Flame Shirt.  Oh, jeez.  Steve is the flame shirt!  We're gonna talk to the guy at 7 o'clock?  Yep. 
[00:36:00]  That is a fiery shirt you're wearing today.  Isn't it? I love this shirt.  Now, do you have your boots on also?  Picking them up today from the shoemaker.  From the shoemaker?  What happened?  You've got to get them stretched out.  They only make, you know, when it comes to flame boots, they don't make them, you know,  specifically.  They make them, you can get a size 12, but you can't, you know.  They don't make them, what, for men?  Yes.  Thank you.  Exactly.  Yeah, I would imagine.  What's the obsession with the flames?  I like it.  Have we talked about this?  What is the obsession? 
[00:36:30]  I just think it's a cool look.  No one else seems to, but I like it.  And I can't find, and when I find a place that has them, I'm just like, ooh, got to  buy three, so.  But every day?  He's flaming.  It's every other day.  Every day you're flaming.  He's on fire.  Every day you're flaming.  Oh, well, I like the hat.  I like the hat, so I make an effort.  But this just happened to show up in the mail yesterday, so I got the Betty Page flu shirt.  Who turned you on to the hat?  What?  Oh, you did.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, this hat?  Yeah, this was Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I love this hat.  And is Betty Page on your flaming shirt?  Betty Page on fire.  Yeah.  On fire. 
[00:37:00]  Yes, she is.  Oh, yeah.  I love these shirts.  I'm going to see if I can get an endorsement deal from one of these companies, because  I'm blowing too much money with these effing shirts.  Yeah, you got some issues, yeah.  I like these shirts.  You definitely have some issues.  The boots are, I'll admit, the boots are a little much.  But I kind of like them.  I kind of like them.  And here's this morning's drunk driving accident.  It's on the Belt Parkway.  Car is completely trashed, upside down, closing the Belt Parkway.  Yeah, that's a road that's not used that much, which is good.  It's still early, though, Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  Anthony, these are all the drunk drivers coming home from the bars.  I mean, we say it every morning.  Every morning, there's another horrific accident.  Wow, look at that car.  That car is off the road.  Is that near the river?  Is that hanging over like a canyon?  I think so.  Is there canyons in New York?  There's people, I don't know.  Oh, wow.  It looks like a head-on.  We had no idea until we started doing mornings.  But every morning, the news will show the most horrific wreck. 
[00:38:00]  And it looks like it's all drunk drivers coming home.  And by the time the bulk of rush hour hits, they've hosed it down and moved on.  You just drive over some pieces of broken glass and maybe a scorch mark in the street and go,  Oh, I wonder what happened there.  Yeah.  Oh, the traffic is just a mess.  Oh, my God.  On the belt.  The belt's closed, right?  You know what you want to do in those circumstances?  Jump out of your car, reach into the ambulance, and just beat the crap out of the person laying in there.  Yep.  Because it's just so annoying to be stuck in traffic under any circumstance. 
[00:38:30]  Ugh.  Ugh.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  The food's here.  We're going to get a Tony Danza update next, huh?  Huh.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Ugh.  People were loving the Tony Danza.  And we...  I think we're doing some of his applause breaks today.  Oh, we should.  We haven't done that in a while.  Back to his applause break.  We got some applause breaks from Tony Danza.  On his crappy, rube-filled show that claps at anything.  All right.  Why don't we play something nice after that really horrific song?  What do we got? 
[00:39:00]  We're all about variety on this program.  Oh, yeah.  Or at least we try.  Christmas is around the corner, and people enjoy this Granny Got Run Over by a Reindeer song.  Oh, but it's not the real one.  Don't fake people out so they go, ugh, I hate this.  Yeah, it sounds like the real one until you listen to the lyrics.  It's Anthony's brother, Joe.  And speaking of Christmas songs, I guess we got the top five worst Christmas songs we're going to do real fast today.  You don't think that the original Granny Got Run Over by a Reindeer is funny?  I crack up every time I hear that.  You're such a liar.  I do.  It's funny.  You are lying. 
[00:39:30]  She got run over by a reindeer or whatever else happened?  Oh.  My grandma, every Christmas, would wear a T-shirt, and it would have reindeer hoofs like she got run over.  No, she wouldn't.  I don't believe you.  Oh, yeah.  Stop it?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, we would laugh.  The life of the party.  My grandma was the greatest, actually.  I used to make my grandmother wear a shirt like that, except it had like a little knife mark  in the left stomach, and we would watch The Godfather 2, and I would whisper, Antonio Andolini. 
[00:40:00]  Was that the grandmother that you tongue kissed?  The godmother.  I only had one grandma.  So friggin' woozy.  I only had one grandma.  I only had one grandma.  Shut up.  I only had one grandma.  You did.  Well, you don't want to get into it today.  But, oh, so it was the same one that you tongue kissed?  Yeah, yeah.  By accident.  By accident, of course.  Not by accident.  That's how you thought people kissed.  No, it was by accident.  Yeah, I didn't know at the time.  I was young.  I was very young. 
[00:40:30]  I'll be open-mouthed kissed as grandmother.  Well, it didn't get to that point.  For the radio purposes, sure.  It might as well have.  Sure, for the radio, yes.  We were playing tonsil hockey.  No, I'll...  Me and my grandma.  There you go.  I remember how it went.  There you go.  You went to kiss her, and you kind of started opening your mouth, and your grandmother was  like, she's...  Knock it off.  Close your mouth.  Yuck.  She did.  All right.  Creep.  That's the real story.  But if you want to think that I was playing tonsil hockey, sure, why not? 
[00:41:00]  Why not?  You sure those were reindeer hoof marks on her shirt, not little Opie's baby shoes?  She crawled up for a good smush.  Fucking creep.  Good wet one.  We'll go to break on that thought.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer Tell us every year, you pretty nerd  Glad to hear about your drunken grandma That tanked up bitch got just what she deserved  Well, I spent that fateful Christmas With the dick that wrote this song 
[00:41:30]  Granny drank whiskey with quaaludes While toking sense of me and from a bomb  I tried to greet his evil grandma But she kicked me in the nuts  She was sucking on a crack pipe Yelling, piss off, die, you bastard scumbag 
[00:42:00]  Puts  Granny got run over by a reindeer Every time I hear that song I twitch  Don't feel bad about that psycho grandma Grandpa paid old Santa off to hit the bitch  There was dinner on the table  There was dinner on the table Granny's crawling underneath  Didn't know what she was up to Till I saw that big old smile on Uncle Pete 
[00:42:30]  Granny left to score some Valium Took off running down the path  That's when old Saint Nicky creamed her Grandpa thanked Rudolph while kissing Santa's ass  Granny got run over by a reindeer Copping dope outside on Christmas Eve 
[00:43:00]  Good riddance to that evil demon Grandma As for me and Grandpa, we're relieved  Oh, Granny was a ho  It was Whip'em Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway  He was involved in a seven-car pileup There was blood and carnage everywhere  But my tits looked great Please, wow responsibly

[00:54:00]  Like newspapers  Props  Things  I don't know  I don't care  I don't even give it a thought  It's something that weighs  On Opie's mind  Well what happened was  Growing up  You know one of seven kids  And my mom  You know  Has OCD really bad  And liked everything neat  And orderly  So our rooms had to be perfect  Oh boy  Or they would  Or the rooms would pretty much  End up outside  Really?  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Oh boy  Sometimes you come home  From school  And you got stuff 
[00:54:30]  On the driveway  So that  Because you didn't clean up  That definitely made an impact  Oh yeah  And even if  Like the room was perfect  Except there was a pair  Of like sneakers  That were kind of  Askew  Off to the side  You know  Then all hell  Would break loose at times  Maybe a slight exaggeration  But it was  It was  It was rough  So when I  Went to college  At Geneseo  I just rebelled  And went the other way  I became the biggest pig  Known to man  I mean I was awful  Just awful  I didn't organize anything  But then  Slowly but surely 
[00:55:00]  I'm getting back to  You know  Getting neater and neater  And cleaner  Well the old office  At NEW  I remember  Ben's desk  Ben's portion  Of the desk  Now the desk wasn't  We didn't have  Individual desks  I did  Opie had one  The rest of the staff  Shared pretty much  A ledge  That was against the wall  Where was this?  At NEW  In where?  The office?  Yeah  Oh I forgot what that was like  To have one  And Opie had  Remember Opie had  Scott Muni's old desk  Opie had that huge 
[00:55:30]  Huge desk  Big wooden desk  And Ben would eye it  Every day to  Put more of his  Crap on it  So Stinky's section  Was pretty well  Taken care of  A little clutter  And then Rick's  Was pretty much  Cluttered also  But not as bad  The middle was Ben's  And it was just  A stack  Of crap  There was CDs  Magazines  Papers  He would have a pile  I'm not exaggerating  Well over a foot high  Of just crap  But he knew 
[00:56:00]  Where everything was  Which was crazy  And it was fine with it  Opie had a problem  With it  And would always  Try to have Ben  Ben  You gotta straighten  That out  You gotta straighten  Why do you think  We got separate offices  Here at XM Satellite Radio  I don't know when  We'll officially be  In them  But you know  Is that why  You took all the  Big lump of papers  Off the desk  And carried it around  In the front of your  Pants now  Ben's already  Taken over this  Little area  Behind these screens  And it's upsetting you 
[00:56:30]  It's making me  Uncomfortable  Because the pile  Will be above the  Screens and that's  When I'll be like  Oh come on  Yesterday I heard him  Say dude  Could you put that  Behind the screens  Because you just  Don't want to look at it  Yeah it's not that  It really isn't that bad  It isn't  No it's not that bad  I mean I know  I kind of like  Things orderly and neat  But it's not  It's not an obsession  Or a problem yet  Well no actually  If you notice today  It's a lot cleaner  I actually threw a lot  Of stuff out  Because I came this morning  It was a mess  I threw a lot of stuff out  I don't mind it at all 
[00:57:00]  I don't give it a thought  It's not that I don't  Mind it or not mind it  It just is out of my mind  I don't care if things  Are showing around  So I gave up  Because it was  It was spending way  I was spending way too much  Time trying to keep my place  Neat  Yeah  I got like two levels  And stuff  You've been there  And so I  I hired a maid  You didn't  I really did  To do what  Clean the one piece  Of furniture  Okay  All done  One can of lemon  Pledge lasts five years 
[00:57:30]  I'm a minimalist though  I don't like a lot  Of stuff in my place  Minimalist  You're a Buddhist  All done  You don't like stuff  In your place  Including happy guests  But you're the major  Fighting to get that gig  I'll take his place  And I'll do it  What an easy gig that is  Really  No food to clean up  You know what  Now that I think about it  She was supposed to be there  Four hours yesterday  She was done in two  Of course she was  And that was like  The first shakedown  Yeah  So that was everything  That's been building up  Yeah  She's going to be in there 
[00:58:00]  For ten minutes  Every time  It's a nice  It's a nice thing to have  You know  Yeah  But  I don't know  I grew up really poor  I mean extremely poor  Ridiculously poor  One haircut a year  Holes in my sneakers  Same jeans  That never faded  Everyone else had  The faded jeans  To this day  It bothers me  What you had  We had the other jeans  That don't fade  The thick denim  Dark blue  Do you know the dark  They look like jeans  But they don't fade  Were you wearing tough skins  No  What the 
[00:58:30]  They're jeans  Levi's  Yeah  The Levi ones  Dungarees  I don't know  They didn't fade  Dungarees  And stupid me  Stupid me growing up  Garanimals  Stupid me growing up  This is what my parents bought  Not knowing at the time  Because I think  That version was cheaper  Than the jeans that faded  Of course  And I didn't know that  At the time  And week after week  Going to  Old Fields Junior High School  With all the hip kids  I'm just waiting for my jeans  To fade  And they just never did  Stiff tough  Industrial denim 
[00:59:00]  That just would  Last forever  Yeah  Same color  As everyone else's  Is fading  And looking cooler  Looking cool  Maybe getting frayed  In the knees  Oh yeah  Frayed in the knees  And all that  And I still have  The same old stiff jeans  Wearing  Carhartts  Titanium pants  Carhartts  So I mean  So for me to get  To this point in my life  Where I really grew up poor  And now I got a maid  It's really strange  Little odd  And I hid from her all day  While she was in my apartment  You hid from her  Yeah  Because I was so uncomfortable 
[00:59:30]  She's upstairs  I'm downstairs  And just sit there  Watching TV or something  Yeah  Pretty much praying  That she's not going to  Come down and yell at me  Because the place is a mess  Yeah  You know something  That's the kind of mindset  You have though  When you don't have  A housekeeper  Or something like that  Dude  If someone's cleaning up  Around you  Or doing something  You always feel like  Uh oh  I have to be working  Or I'm going to get yelled at  How about this  Before she got there  I straightened up  You cleaned up a little bit  I cleaned up  Because I felt so guilty 
[01:00:00]  That someone was cleaning my crap  Clean this up  You guinea brat  So she's like a Polish woman  That speaks no English really  Is she hot?  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  Not at all  She big old  What?  She's middle age  A little chubby  And out of breath  She shows up in my door  With  Yuck  With cigarette breath  In between jobs  She's just chain smoking  On the subway  No you can't do that  On the subway  Fat as Matic Polack 
[01:00:30]  Clean up the house now  And you know  Clean the house  And they work them  Like slaves  From you know  Building to building  To building  All over Manhattan  So you know  So she's running  I mean I'm downstairs  I'm not kidding you guys  I'm hiding  Because I'm like  So like  This is so uncomfortable  Not me  But maybe I'll get used to it  I might have to blow it off  Because it was too weird  Yeah  Dude it's great  I don't even flush the toilet  When I know they're coming over  You have one  Yeah two Chinese people  Really ancient Chinese people  Two ancient Chinese people 
[01:01:00]  Honestly yeah yeah yeah  But I mean  Why would you care  It's beautiful  You pay them  Maybe I should get one  You have to  Even if you don't need it  Just to look at them  While they're doing it  That's right motherfucker  Pick that paper up  And move it over there  So  So I'm downstairs  And I hear her running  From you know  Like the kitchen  To the bathroom  To the bedroom  To the living room  Just running  Because she's trying to get  Everything done  So she can go to the next gig  And I hear her out of breath  Sounds like she needs food  And I'm like  It's just so uncomfortable  You don't offer her anything  That's not part of the gig 
[01:01:30]  I don't know how to  I don't know what you do  I don't have anything  No I haven't  Oh he doesn't have anything  I don't know  Honestly I wanted to offer her something  Because every time I try to talk to her  She had no idea what I was saying  And I'm doing sign language  And stuff  Did she find your flu underwear  Coming in on instant feedback  Do you leave any skidmarsh sick underwear  Around the house  Your flu underwear  My flu underwear  Is probably being worn  By one of the homeless guys  That sleeps outside my apartment  Oh you threw it out the window  Man they go through my garbage 
[01:02:00]  Every night  It's amazing  Oh through the garbage  Absolutely amazing  But so then I'm downstairs  I'm not kidding  I'm hiding  I'm just like  Oh god just go away  You know  Yeah  And all of a sudden  I hear the most horrendous crash  And then in some weird like  Well in Polish  Some Polish words  Dude I'm not lying to you  I thought my maid  On the first day  Had a heart attack  Really  You thought you were going to  Pick up dead maid  Out of your  Then I hear nothing  Vacuum running  Oh no no no 
[01:02:30]  No no no  I actually  Asked her  When the vacuum  Was coming out  Oh right  I forgot  Oh he's got an  No no no  To the sound of a vacuum  I asked her  And that was  I was able to translate  I was like  I was pointing at the vacuum  And her  And going  And she's like  And then she gave me  The sign that  She unzipped your fly  Yeah  Then it was obvious  That the vacuum  Was coming soon  And that's when  I left the place  You want the Hoover job 
[01:03:00]  You want the blood job  I give for you  No that's when I left  I left  Oh yeah  No I cannot handle vacuums  For I don't know why  Obi freaks out  At the sound  Of a vacuum cleaner  And it's not because  It's loud or anything  This certain sound  That the vacuum makes  Gives you like  Nails on a chalkboard  Kind of feeling  You guys seen it  Goosebumps  Goosebumps  And whatever you want to call them  I love the smell  When you're vacuuming  That smell  There's a weird  I like that  That vacuum cleaner smell  That clean rug smell 
[01:03:30]  I think it was because  My mom used to vacuum  Just all the time  Yeah  You know  And then bang right  Into your feet  While you're watching TV  That's the worst  People that have dogs  And their vacuum  Just stinks like wet dog  When they use it  Oof  So uh  I borrow my vacuum  So I thought she was dead  Borrowes vacuums  People do  I thought she was dead  And I had to come upstairs  To make sure she was alright  And she was fine  Yeah  Living to  Come and clean your house  Another day  I don't know  It was weird  You don't know 
[01:04:00]  I don't know  I mean the place looks great but  Maybe next time  I'll just leave  For the whole time  Really  I don't know  You should  I love doing this  Where I need something done  If there's something  That needs to be picked up  You don't clap  I point  Two quick claps  And I point  I have a little bell  That I ring  Jingle jingle jingle  Hey can I try that  And you have a luxury too  We haven't talked about  A luxury  I opted a different road  I went a different route

[01:16:00]  The WoWs on back of trucks  As you're driving around  The United States of America  Or you may have seen  Some of the WoW stickers  The official  O&A wow sticker  Which you can get through  OpianAnthony.com  Basically, this is how it works  You put WoW on your car  And if the ladies feel like it  They will flash you  It has been happening for  I don't know  About seven years now, Anthony  It's called Whip them out Wednesday  Or Whip them out whenever  That's what the WoW stands for  And I think we have a sticker stop  Happening today  This is how pathetic 
[01:16:30]  The marketing department is  At XM Satellite Radio  You've got to call them out on it  If they're doing nothing for us  That's not true  What are they doing for us?  I heard that at a party  Two of them were talking about it  And somebody overheard it  Oh, okay  So we've taken it upon ourselves  To kind of market the show  Kind of a grassroots thing  It's the listeners  That are making this show bigger  Not the marketing department  At XM Satellite Radio  But they have big plans for us  In 05  I'm just waiting to see  What they come up with, Anthony 
[01:17:00]  But we have Rob  He's on Long Island  He's doing his own  WoW sticker stop  In the middle of nowhere  So this should help a little bit  Oh my goodness  That is far out there  I'm sure he'll be handing out  At least 10 stickers today  Yes, Rob  What's going on?  Bro, I've handed out  Probably like 100 stickers today, man  I had people coming out  From Levittown  I had people coming out  From like all the way out east  I had one guy  That works from Cablevision  He said by 9 o'clock tonight  He's going to have  Like every Cablevision truck  Like with a WoW sticker on it  Gave him a whole stack  It's going great today, man  All right 
[01:17:30]  Cool  And where are you at?  Well, thanks at 69 South  I'm like right on  Waiting River Road out here  You know what's odd?  It's satellite radio  And our signal still doesn't  Make it out that far  That is way out there  On Long Island  They don't even have evolution  Out there yet  Hey, man  It's going good, though  You've got to put your sunglasses on  Because the Montauk Point  Lighthouse shines in your face  When you stand there  At that exit  Okay, cool  Thank you, Rob  No problem, guys  Thank you, mister  There you go  Our listeners  Take it upon themselves 
[01:18:00]  I don't even know  How this happened  But the listeners said  No, man  This show  I love this show  And I want other people  To listen to it  So I will take it upon myself  To spread the virus  The O&A virus  Exit 69  That's way out there  Don't people know  Exit 70 is England?  That's really far out there  Doing a sticker stop  At Piccadilly Square  Or is it Circle?  Circus?  Piccadilly, what is it?  Piccadilly Circus  Is that the name? 
[01:18:30]  I said Robert  Whatever his name is  Did the Friday the 13th movie  So whatever  Wait, what's that big stupid thing  With the big  Not our own Big Ben  But the big delicious clock in England  That's Big Ben  That's Big Ben  Yeah, I know  Which one is that?  Piccadilly Circus  Is like their Times Square  Piccadilly Circus?  Yeah, it's all lights  And there's theaters  Yeah, it looks like a circus  There's a circle there  Oh, I call it that  Which is a word that means circle 
[01:19:00]  It's a Latin word  Or a Greek word  What is it?  Circus?  It's circular  Circus  And it's a circle  Like with a bunch of  You know, Times Square-like lights around it  Signs  Piccadilly Square  Piccadilly Square  Jolly good  Make another turn then  Make another right  Wrong side of the road  Dopes  So everyone wants the Tony Danza update, Anthony 
[01:19:30]  Oh  Yesterday, once again, we went to the line  Of people that were waiting to get into the Tony Danza show  Yes  Anthony does an amazing Tony Danza impression  Thank you  He didn't even know he could do it  But one day he tried it and it worked  You just gotta sound stupid  Right  So we've been messing with the line  Ever since we started on XM Satellite Radio  From time to time  And these stupid rubes  Pretty much from the Midwest  Were believing they were actually talking to Tony Danza 
[01:20:00]  And then Tony Danza would get really rude  And outrageous  And ruin their little image of Tony Danza  Basically ask the old rubes for BJ's  Before the show  So Tony can relax  You think they're freaking out over there right now  Listening going  Uh oh  Uh oh  They might be coming to the line again  So yesterday it got ugly  You know, we were doing another one  I think it was our fourth maybe  And security was on to us  They were just waiting  Yes  They were just waiting for us to show up again  And we were very sneaky yesterday 
[01:20:30]  We didn't advertise it or promote it  We just went right to the phone  There was Eric  Sex Bagel  Online  Talking to another rube  With his fine Tony Danza t-shirt  That we had made up  Wearing  Not even a t-shirt  A nice collared shirt  Tony Danza staff shirt  I think he also had like a nice  Tony Danza staff leather jacket  Oh my god  Sorry to interrupt you  They just showed a security camera  In a convenience store  Where this black guy  Is trying to rob this Arab  No, I think it's another black guy  It's a black woman I think 
[01:21:00]  No, behind the counter?  Yeah, that's a black  It's like an Arab guy  That's a black woman  Is it?  Is she still shooting?  He's trying to rob Shirley Hemphill  Yeah, and he robbed her  And then as he's trying  To make his escape  She pulls a gun  Good  And just starts  Plugging the guy  That looks like an Arab to you?  Are you insane?  It looks like Wanda Sykes  It looks like Wanda Sykes  From the back of the camera  That's Wanda Sykes  I'd be a great witness  Wouldn't I?  I'm looking right at her  You racist  Arab man  It was an Arab man  I swear  A black woman  She looks like Mohammed Atta  I mean, that's Mabel King  You guys gotta see the video 
[01:21:30]  ABC just showed it  I'm sure every  Well, go right to Fox  The guy's leg was twitching for a while  Fox will have it on a loop  For the next 24 hours  Oh, sure  So what happened?  Because that was over my head here  Guy walks in  A black guy walks in  To the register  I guess says something like  Give me your money  She opens the register  Takes out the cash  Hands it to the guy  The guy starts walking away  She pulls a gun out  And just starts firing at him  And then left the guy  Laying on the floor  In a bunch of  The litter of chips 
[01:22:00]  And Entenmann's cookies  His little feet were twitching  His little feet were twitching  For a little while  And then  That was it  She just emptied that gun into him  That's kind of what it looked like  I didn't see anything though  It looked like he was shot  Oh, he was shot  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Because they usually don't show shooting  Like that on TV  Well, yeah  I'm surprised  No, no, no  Lately they're starting to show  Everything on TV  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Maybe she yelled  Get on the ground  Get on the ground  I don't know  I gotta see the clip  With the sound now  Oh, you're right 
[01:22:30]  Someone  I don't know  Someone, I'm sure  Yeah, help us out  On the instant feedback  On the instant feedback  Alright, so then we went to Tony Danza  And we did another one  Of the phone calls  It went beautifully  Once again, Anthony  And all of a sudden  Eric was ready to leave  And pretty much  He said there's a huge  Security guard there  That won't let him leave  Yes  Was knocking the phone  Out of his hand  And then Eric was trying  To call the show  And then he's hanging  You know, he's hanging up the phone  And then he grabbed the phone  Away from him  And he had Eric  He was holding Eric  Yes  And supposedly they called the cops 
[01:23:00]  And got very, very ugly yesterday  We were on the phone  With cop friends  Trying to have a little fun, right?  Master Paul wanted to run over there  And break someone's neck  Yeah, he was very upset  Let's just say  I've heard he's been told  That he's not allowed  To call the cops  Oh, really?  Well, he gets a little excited  Because he's trying to protect us  I understand that  Yeah, that definitely wasn't  A 911 type call  So, the update  Eric, come in here real fast 
[01:23:30]  Or he can talk from there  If you want  What?  I think he was saying  He can't talk from there  Oh, okay  For some reason  Oh, Flaming Steve  Has taken his place  At the helm  For some reason  They can't hear that mic  Over the air  So  Oh, alright  It's gonna be like a sauna  After he's in there  With that shirt  For a couple of minutes  It's like  It's like a steam room  Now in there  So, Eric  I guess we all decided  Not to press charges  And not to  Call the police  And get them involved  Right?  Are you okay with that?  I'm fine with it 
[01:24:00]  That's what I was advised to do  And I agree with it  Oh, advised  Really?  Yeah  Had a couple of phone calls  Yesterday after the show  And it was advised  That we don't do that  Some police officers?  Yeah  Yeah, because we would  Look kind of silly  We would look silly  And nerdy  We need something really good  If we're gonna  You know, involve the cops  Right  Something like  Just a little  Little shoulder  Shaking  All the crap we get away with  We can handle  If one of our guys  Gets slightly roughed up  Right?  That's fine 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, I had no problem with it  Roughed up  My only problem is  Now we can't work the line anymore  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  We will  Yeah  That's why we're smart  All right  Just when you think  It's over, Johnny  You watch what happens next  All right, good  Jason, go ahead  What's up, guys?  Hey  Hey, you gotta continue the bit?  Because that's definitely worth  A delay  Yeah, we got some ideas  We might take it  To the next level  Sweet  Because, you know  To sit there  And listen to those 
[01:25:00]  Frigging clowns go  Oh, woo, woo  And she's creaming in her shorts  You know, it's just classic  Yeah, I got a backup plan, actually  Sweet  I kind of know that area  I got a backup plan  You guys suck  All right, thank you, Jason  So, yeah  That's the update, pretty much  Mm-hmm  And we should  We should go right into  The applause breaks  This is one of our favorite things  To do on the new show, Anthony  Oh, when we're done  With the show here  At the end of the show  We turn on  The Tony Danza show  And he comes out 
[01:25:30]  And before he does his monologue  Or as he's doing his monologue  We count how many  Applause breaks there are  These rubes  That come to see him  Will clap at anything  The drop of a  Tony's hat  And they're clapping  And we're amazed  At the nonsense  That comes out of his mouth  And the applause  That it gets from the audience  And this is only one show  One show  Every day  Every day there's about  10 to 12 applause breaks  For stupid crap  Yeah  Absolutely stupid crap 
[01:26:00]  That means nothing  Nothing  And this is what makes good TV  These days  I guess  I guess so  So here's today's  Tony Danza applause breaks  We'll stop  After each one  We'll start with this  And thanks for tuning in  At home  That was my son  Outside  Putting up the wreath  With us  My little  I had him on my shoulders  For a while  And then I realized  The last time he was on my shoulders  He was four  So you know  Kind of crazy  How's everyone

[02:03:00]  the yell of faggot that's that's great wow that's kind of like a psa yeah hey you know 
[02:03:30]  safe sex aids will kill you getting the message out to the kids huh sure wow  that's uh a little dangerous little dangerous yeah we should get this guy on the phone let's uh call  him up and see what he's about what's his name byron byron everyone in the media is talking to  this guy in the next week or two i mean everybody really yeah 60 minutes is uh doing a piece pretty  much everybody's talking to him on the phone but yeah we we found out about him uh where's he from 
[02:04:00]  he was in newsweek he's uh from minnesota oh minnesota yeah it's byron yeah he's 33 he looks like  he's about 50 he's got this record label that i can't pronounce what you got a picture  panzer faust oh yeah he looks like a big nazi uh yeah his record uh company's been around five years  and has quickly become one of the top white power record labels in the country there's a lot of  white power record labels who knew they couldn't behave any worse than than the source awards hey 
[02:04:30]  byron yeah yeah what's going on man hey what's happening bud well we uh we read the article in  newsweek and we've we we got samples of your uh your music your catchy little ditties yeah people  like people haters huh huh what people like the people haters huh people like the people haters yeah  yeah yeah people seem to like the uh people like the tunes yeah even skinheads have a sense of  humor huh well well that's what we're trying to figure out here it's like uh it's kind of a sense 
[02:05:00]  of humor that's a little you know hateful hateful yeah well that's all right so this is this  this philosophy that these songs are uh uh spreading around uh it's it's one you believe in oh sure of  course yeah wholeheartedly yeah sure it's your mission to spread the word around uh and what  what is what is the basic philosophy of uh panzer faust well really we're just uh we're a pro-white 
[02:05:30]  music company uh we produce white power rock and roll but instead of just being like pro-white and  white pride it seems like you're also anti you know black gay uh jewish arab and in order to be  uh proud of being white does that necessarily go hand in hand with having to hate uh people that  aren't well we don't necessarily hate people i mean uh it does sound like from the song lyrics it  sounds very hateful uh byron well i mean that that's fine but i mean listen there's uh there's  rap music with lyrics like uh kill the white people make them hurt kill the white people but buy my 
[02:06:00]  record first but nobody accuses time warner of hating white people but that's the lyrics they produce  he's got a valid point point i agree uh 100 percent with that there's a lot of rap songs that are uh  you know it's a double standard if uh if a white guy uh like byron puts out a song that uh uh preaches  white power and white pride and in the same time at the same time bashes blacks uh he's labeled uh racist  hateful uh but the black record companies can put out anti-white uh rhetoric and uh it's just music 
[02:06:30]  that that is backed by uh major record companies it's seen as a i'm sorry no what's that it's seen  as a view into the mind of urban youth right right right hateful and uh is that is that what you're  doing this kind of an answer back to uh a lot of that well yeah i mean look we've got tens of thousands  of customers in over 40 different countries um there's a growing backlash among the white population 
[02:07:00]  that are tired of the double standards and one of those double standards is uh what the blacks are  allowed to get away with for example they can be millionaires um for singing about killing and  hurting white people they can win grammy awards they can get movie roles uh but if you're a white  guy and you sing uh the same thing about them then you get asked why you're a hate monger and maybe you  get raided by the gang strike force and sent to prison for hate crimes yeah that's kind of you know  what it is though that that is just kind of the way it is and uh you know there's really it is a 
[02:07:30]  double standard yes but uh it's just the way it is and i i really don't see that changing well it  may not change but what people are going to have to get used to is see we we've had to move over in  this country for decades we've had to move over for homosexuals we've got what how has homosexuality  put you uh made you move over put you like interrupted or interfered with your lifestyle well uh in in  little ways but in ways that people have to put up with every day for example there are safe zones 
[02:08:00]  in high schools for homosexual kids and there are gay clubs that the school has to pay for and  sponsor but uh the straight pride kids get kicked out of school and the straight kids can't wear  confederate flag belt buckles because that offends some other group what i'm saying is we've had to  move over and be tolerant for every group in this country and we're we're ready and willing to um  be the target of some of that tolerance ourself okay byron just let me ask you a question and up 
[02:08:30]  is part of it i'm playing devil's advocate here but as part of that top let that tolerance  people could say well that's just a reaction to a lot of vicious behavior and and people being  mistreated for a long time so what's happening now is kind of backlash or a response to a lot of uh  uh oppression and vicious behavior well it is and uh but you know that's going to happen on both sides  i mean of course the blacks are going to say well we're mad at you guys because of all this  suppression from centuries ago but you tell me how a 15 year old kid who gets beaten up in school 
[02:09:00]  by a black gang feels like he's responsible for something that happened 500 years ago right and  who's responsible for what you know when do white people have to stop paying for what happened centuries  ago let me ask you a question have you found like is shit dick having problems getting airplay  on commercial radio uh i've never really attempted to have that played on commercial radio  yeah i knew the one that was the biggest song because of the length of it i think it's too long  what's the biggest song uh on your record label right now oh uh it's really hard to say you know 
[02:09:30]  we've got we've got probably 600 different cd titles um and there's hundreds in fact there's  thousands of uh white power bands uh it's a growing underground in the music scene yeah most of them  really suck though uh actually you're not right about that in fact some of the cds i can send you  guys uh we'll put it this way um yeah it's a lot of the thrash metal that just sounds like crap or  country that just sounds like crap how much white how much white power music have you actually listened 
[02:10:00]  to i've done my research well listen here listen here we've got uh six streaming radio stations with  over 6 000 mp3s and uh for all the people that think our music sucks uh they're welcome to go to  panzerfaust.com and listen to it sir i wasn't saying your music sucked i enjoyed i gave a little  toe tap to uh some of those tunes yeah i'm just saying a lot of it a towel's not a hat is a great  song are there gonna be any bands by the way i heard some of them are playing at the downtown on 
[02:10:30]  december 23rd jesus in long island plugging whore i want to know that's when you're playing  oh sorry you ass must be a good one yeah it's a great club in long island byron um harry in ohio  wants to say hi harry what's up what's up man what what the fuck's this guy's problem he's a  fucking moron he's a fucking idiot he ought to call his record label fucking penis mouth because  that's what he has in his fucking mouth he's a douchebag well now white power bands ain't never 
[02:11:00]  gonna get off the ground they're gonna stay on the ground just like uh just like fucking years  ago dude i mean you might as well forget it there's not gonna be a fucking race war there's gonna be a  world war if anything i gotta agree with harry on this one uh byron i don't think uh i don't think  there's enough people uh in your cause i think that's kind of a good thing i really you know it's  kind of hard to go to work when there's a race war going on yep and uh and i i think uh taking what 
[02:11:30]  some of the stuff you said earlier uh i don't think it's it's necessarily a good thing that just  because there's a lot of hate music coming out of black people um as far as you know anti-white  sentiment and their music and and it seems to be a record company acceptance of this i don't think  it's necessarily good that uh the reply is for white guys to get together and uh make you know  equally hateful music of of uh black people i don't know if that's the answer it may or may not be a 
[02:12:00]  good thing but you're gonna have it you're gonna get it you know there's a lot of people that are  irritated with what's going on and uh people that have sat back and allowed this to happen to our  country really don't have a right to judge what form that backlash takes yeah well the thing is a lot  of people are very apathetic if things happen we don't care we go to work uh how is this damaging  how is black rap bands and uh homosexuality uh how is this damaging to the to the country well 
[02:12:30]  listen multiculturalism is what causes racial tension racist people do not cause racial tension  forced multiculturalism causes that and multiculturalism is destroying this country on the one hand but on  the other hand look it's just art i mean if robert maplethorpe can put uh elephant dung on christian  icons on stage and call it art well whether people like it or not songs like shit dick hey that that's  people expressing themselves and their opinions well that's uh you know something i and i agree with you  there i i think you should be able to say whatever the hell you want and uh when it comes to music i think 
[02:13:00]  anybody should be able to say whatever they want but you can't expect acceptance from from people and you  can't expect that just because you you do have the right to say it that it's really going to do  anything but bring uh uh more hate into the picture you know great well great because if blacks are  going to hate us then great let's get it on so you're like the wheels come off you're more into a  separatism than uh uh you know keeping the races apart you do what you do we'll do what we do 
[02:13:30]  we agree uh us and louis you know if louis farrakhan ran for president i might actually register to vote in  this country but until then i'm not gonna and i gotta disagree one thing you said like i know  what you're saying about like the political correctness has kind of made things go the  other way but as far as like you know in multiculturalism uh only always fueling racial  tension don't forget man and it's only 30 years ago 35 years ago in the south racial tension started  there really wasn't much multiculturalism it was a black culture and a white culture both people  lived separate it wasn't equal and that was what started the uh the tension it wasn't necessarily 
[02:14:00]  that there was a mixing it was that one was here one was there and one was good and one was shit  well you know that wasn't that's not really accurate uh when the blacks had their own  communities their own neighborhoods their own businesses they were much better off and blacks  actually realized that it was actually integration and and desegregation that destroyed the black  community but then what you had was every black who could afford to move out of the ghetto could  and that left huge pockets of poverty where the kids had no role models and no tax base except for 
[02:14:30]  the pimps and the drug dealers but i'm talking about the resentment and the tension i mean do you  think back then that there was equal protection given by the government and under the law uh an  equal protection given by the police and then people were treated the same in the legal system  well no of course not and the thing is they're not supposed to be um for example do white people  get treated equally in south africa or rhodesia um does any culture or any race treat another culture  or race uh whether it's the hindus or the pakistanis or you know um get hindus get mistreated 
[02:15:00]  so you say i mean wait you're so you're saying that because they they are a minority in the  country that sorry you should just expect this well listen all i'm saying is you cannot tell me of a  place on this planet in history ever where multiculturalism has been nice and sweet and  peaceful and everybody sat around and ate marshmallows and saying kumbaya multiculturalism  causes racial tension period now did blacks get mistreated in the south i'm sure well but not  not to interrupt you but you can't technically he's right multiculturalism or mixing races causes 
[02:15:30]  racial tension but i mean that that's like saying you can only have domestic violence if a couple is  married or live together i mean obviously by the nature of tension you have to have two parties  together if it's racial they have to be two different races you're not going to have racial  tension between two italians so that's it's not it's kind of a non-point no no it is a point because  obviously marriage is something that's good for society no it's not the races it's not good for  society marriage is not i'm not saying marriage is great for society i mean come on marriage has  kind of failed wouldn't you say well i think uh... the fact that if well okay these days people have 
[02:16:00]  kids without getting married but look for thousands of years in our our culture and civilization it was  marriage that resulted in uh... you know kids being born and and the human race being promoted i mean  uh... whether these days marriage is a good thing or not i don't know but i mean uh...  now you have you had any personal experiences that kind of lady in this direction what what how old  were you when you kind of uh... got on the uh... white pride uh...  well i've been uh... i'm thirty three now married i have three kids i've been a white power skinhead since 
[02:16:30]  i was seventeen years old um... i've been uh... i've been to prison i've lived in africa i've traveled the  world i've met a lot of different people i'm not some dumbass that's never read a book you know  what i mean i kind of know what's going on in this country  why were you in africa  actually i uh... went down to south africa before mandela got elected uh... be honest because i thought  there was going to be a war down there trying to find a suitable doc so when we send them all back  they know where to land  i'll tell you what if you want to see racial tension you want to see racism 
[02:17:00]  go see how the blacks treat each other in africa  i read about all that stuff every day in rhodesia and uh... it's a it's a mess it's a complete  mess is that racial tension or is that more tribal  no it's racial tension to them because they consider themselves to be uh... a separate distinct  race uh... for example if a coza gets caught screwing somebody from the zulu tribe they kill  them both they consider that race mixing and i've had blacks in africa tell me to my face  you let your american blacks come here and call themselves africans we'll make slaves out of them 
[02:17:30]  because if you're a mixed tribe they consider that to be racially mixed  um... the same as the indian tribes in america you know  everybody uh... plays the sad violin music about indians in america  you know they basically came here by following trails of buffalo shit from china  you know  um... there's nothing holy or magical about uh... indians  and they used to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands  and that was racial tension  these tribes a lot of the names for these tribes was  the people 
[02:18:00]  they didn't consider the other tribes to even be human  and they would slaughter each other over killing grounds  that was two different cultures or they considered themselves two different races  competing over resources  that was racial tension  so you're saying that basically  well you are you saying that we should basically adopt the same mentality  as say 16th century uh... indians lopping each other's heads off  or scalps whatever it is they did  well no i mean the the the indian example i gave was just that  it's an example but it's an example of racial tension  uh... existing with or without white people 
[02:18:30]  you know these these people seem to think if they can do away with the white racists  you're going to do away with racial tension  who says that happen  no no no you did you get a point about it happening in  in in in in pakistan and india and all over the world there's  problems with islam and the rest of the world that have nothing to do with white people  it's it's not all about white people  i think he's talking about in this country uh... people feel if they get rid of the white races  everybody's going to be all happy and live together in harmony  and whether he says uh... no  there's a professor at harvard  called uh...  i think there's a few of them over there  okay he's a jewish professor 
[02:19:00]  what's his name  his name is noel ignatiev  he's a he's a jewish harvard professor  he actually advocates the uh... the distinction uh... the extinction of the white race  i've never heard that  where can we where can we back this up  i mean you're saying it  but if you can kind of say anything  where where can we find this out  i've never heard this before  and who cares if he did  you can google him up  he's got a website called racetrader.org  he's a harvard professor  it's a you know it shouldn't take a ten year old kid five minutes on google to verify that 
[02:19:30]  uh... you can meet a lot of good ten-year-old kids if you google them  i'm kind of off the subject i'm just saying  but what's that got to do with anything some so some what it got to do with is well put it this way too uh... you know white people make up less than eight percent of the earth's population okay  but whenever you hear people talking about fighting racism  they're talking about fighting white racism what i'm saying is there's a lot of racial tension there's a lot of racism in the world but when you hear people talking about fighting racism it's always the white guys  you know i gotta be honest and you're right it's been forever but let's be honest in the last hundred years as far as the military is concerned you know white people have pretty much you know you gotta give the thumbs up to us uh... as far as like you know germany world domination i mean napoleon uh... most of the guys that have been popular or well known for looking for world domination are white i'm not saying it's been that way throughout history but at least in the last year 
[02:20:00]  you know couple hundred years white people have pretty much had the market uh... corner on that and here but you have to remember something that's not because of lack of desire it's because of lack of ability for example when people say well uh... the indians never polluted before the white man came well that's because they hadn't invented a god damn chimney when you go to south america and you show them people a chainsaw 
[02:20:30]  they'll they'll clear their god damn uh... rainforest in a heartbeat  uh... the thing is before we came along they'd never invented a chainsaw so of course they couldn't have uh... you know now of course if you don't have weapons of mass destruction  of course how can you dominate the world when you're fighting with a stick with a rock tied to it you know  yeah but i'm just a lack of desire or lack of ability uh... notwithstanding i'm just making the point that's why white people probably have gotten the bad rap in the last hundred years 
[02:21:00]  well you say yeah for whatever reason but the the reason being that the europeans have been able to come up with some really great inventive machinery  that made it that much easier to make their attempt at war world domination yeah and they've been good at it  well look at what about the good things racist white people have done the fact that you've got a computer is because of a racist man called professor william shockley who was a phd  he was a racist put it this way you look around your studio everything you see with your eyes was invented by a racist white guy 
[02:21:30]  a racist white guy somebody invented that and now you're getting a little far-fetched somebody invented a prosthetic bulge for the front of a producer's pants  well i guess you got me on that one that i bet you hey but i bet you whoever uh... invented that probably didn't like niggers  how can you say that that it's invented by racist white people easy uh... before the before a few decades ago being racially conscious was the norm  i mean look henry ford abraham lincoln thomas jefferson george washington look in history if you look at your printer look at the telephone 
[02:22:00]  um... look at i mean uh... paper pencil you name it it was probably invented a long time ago by white guys  and this whole fad this failed social experiment of multiculturalism has kind of become popular since the nineteen sixties  before that for thousands of years we were all racist and white if you're if you're white your ancestors were racist otherwise you'd be picking shit with the chickens in some mud hut in africa somewhere  watson come quick there's a darky behind me 
[02:22:30]  wasn't that uh... alexander grambell's first uh... word over the telephone  i don't know  but uh... just to say to make a statement like well  you know it was probably invented by i'm sure there's plenty of white races that have invented things but you just can't say that everything you're looking at was probably invented by a white guy who didn't like blacks and  kind of present it as a fact  what racism was the norm look at nasa who flew to the moon  well there's a racist white guys  racist you're saying neil armstrong was a racist they were white guys but why racist white guys buzz altering you're not really explaining yourself with that yeah well 
[02:23:00]  i guess you'd have to have some knowledge of uh... of the world and how things work but i mean  before the nineteen sixties  everybody was racially conscious and when there wasn't a whole lot of um...  you know that the stuff that we see today with the race mixing and the multiculturalism and all that crap that shit didn't fly before the nineteen  sixties you're saying they went to the moon to get further away from the queers  yeah  and then neil armstrong jumped on the moon because he will look at the dark side  you know that the theory i think i'm a look into them 
[02:23:30]  now you can't just take a people racially conscious  and now it's become a crime to mention race at all due to political correctness it doesn't mean that everybody doesn't assume that everybody back then had to be racist you know  that's a little far-fetched  the vast majority were if you look at uh... you can look at anything from supreme court  uh... justices to the president to uh... people like mark twain henry ford that was the norm any anybody that has any no no i i i understand i'm not look i'm not going to say that some of your points aren't valid i'm not going to throw a blanket over everything you say just because 
[02:24:00]  that's your platform and say it's all bullshit there are a couple of things that you're saying that you make a valid point whether you agree with it or not is is another thing but you're making valid points but then to say that just because back then uh...  uh...  we didn't have this racial diversity we have now doesn't necessarily mean that every white guy that was inventing something uh... was like you know turning a wrench going out god damn  well you know the the thing is they probably didn't have to do that to that extent without the the multiculturalism there was really no need for racial tension but it was a healthy it was a healthy environment people were racially conscious and uh... 
[02:24:30]  uh... and i'm not gonna i can't argue with you and split hairs about every single guy that ever invented anything uh...  uh... with a hardcore you know try to try to keep those blanket statements out of your uh... you're talking i think you're a lot better what was the event in your life that turned into a racist by the way well uh... it had to be something  you know really to be honest with you it came from uh... my life experience uh... there was never any one particular but there must have been a day where you just you know your whole philosophy how you thought about things just drastically changed like there had to be that one thing 
[02:25:00]  no there really wasn't there it was a period i mean i i grew up in the south so i mean i probably was raised about as racist as anybody is  um... but after uh... reading enough books and and getting enough life experience you kind of start to draw some conclusions but you know the one of the biggest recruiters for our movement  in this country is black people  doing what they do every single day  uh... and you know to be honest the amount of mainstream support that we get  would probably shock and disappoint people like you and your listeners maybe 
[02:25:30]  but uh... we hear from people that you don't hear from  uh... and i'm talking kids parents teachers cops lawyers  people that come to us  and tell us what's going on in their area  that they're not going to say oh you know publicly because there's a price to be paid socially for being racially conscious  but i hear it  and um...  like i said we've got tens of thousands of customers and they're coming from somewhere  all right now you know why i i i could see what you mean uh... 
[02:26:00]  but  you know i don't think that's that's an answer to it  i think you you know everybody who isn't pissed off at uh... you know when when you look at the news and you see a pattern on the news and and you look and go all my god again look another black guy did this another uh... it could be blamed on the media i've heard that excuse used things like that but it gets people upset but  yeah i don't think the answer is to rush into a white power group and uh... start uh... preaching hate against uh... races and and uh... sex and religion i i think the thing you can do is live your life as a a good guy 
[02:26:30]  um... you know set an example  through your actions you know you go to work every day  you you you tow the line  you know and uh... and  you know perhaps people will will take your example  i don't think it's good to  run out there and just start  doing the opposite  like you're doing the same thing 
[02:27:00]  that the thugs are doing  but you're at the other you know end of the light spectrum that's all  well we're not doing the same thing the thugs are doing the thugs are out there selling crack carjacking old ladies uh... you know serial raping college students that's what that's what's going on out there  yeah you're you're you're kind of preaching the elimination of entire peoples you know  kind of like you know kill the nigger that's  you know that's kind of like  what what about what about the law abiding black people that are you know working raising families and 
[02:27:30]  hey look i mean you can pick a few of our uh... you know a few of our song lyrics or bar i mean look our music is pretty extreme  there's no getting around that  um... and we don't censor our bands we've got dozens of bands on our label  um... we don't censor them some of them uh... have different points from each other but  our party line or our the thing that we're telling kids is not go out and let's see if we can exterminate black people  um... i think they would pick that up from some of the the songs  well you know they might and and you know when it's against the law to say shocking and outrageous things then we'll turn ourselves in and until then they can pound it up their ass 
[02:28:00]  yeah we're on the same page with you there  yeah i kinda agree with what you're definitely not saying as far as the freedom to to put that out but  yeah you know what's saying that you constitutionally aren't protected i mean no one says you can't  write songs like that or publish them  play whatever you want  you know yeah everybody says you got the right to do it  but see uh... there's a lot of things that guys in your position wouldn't be aware of like  what people have to put up with to do what this is for example the other day we got we got it  no trust me we get it 
[02:28:30]  we kicked off the air two years ago we're talking about we get it we get it  we get it uh...  hey listen i used to listen to you guys uh... like when you pulled that chick's wig off and i was pretty hardcore by the way  but uh...  you know i used to i used to live outside washington dc  the racist things that was hardcore Anthony  i guess i am the devil that is really uh...  i'm the white devil  everybody that i knew  like on john job sites where there were still any white people left on construction job sites  everybody that i knew  listen to you guys  right  everybody that i knew 
[02:29:00]  listen to my music and loved it  and uh... and agreed with me  so there's probably a lot more of your listeners  byron i'm not gonna lie to you  we've we've been playing your your songs for the last two days and i  we're kind of laughing  they're funny i think they're they're catchy  uh... there's a few of them though that are just pure hate  you know if you take if you take some and you're mature enough to listen to these  and take it for for uh... what i think some of them are is kind of a joke  kind of goofy  i mean this the the passion behind why they wrote it might be uh... what you what you're preaching 
[02:29:30]  but you know for me to listen to it i'm laughing i'm kind of a dark you know  well don't take it personally not that way i'm white  but now i'm kinda i like the dark humor and stuff like that  shut up ass  you're italian  i'm italian  you're dark italian i don't know what's going on over there  i'm not dark italian  we're gonna start looking at you differently now  yeah  i'm shaving my head tomorrow  hey come on white power  white power everybody  white power people  hey listen those songs that you guys are playing they're uh... you know we got a sense of humor too 
[02:30:00]  we're not all a bunch of mouth breathing idiots that hate everybody  we got a sense of humor those are funny songs but  well at the end of the day that's what our jobs are here with our show we're trying to make people laugh  and sometimes it's uh... you know one of these really just  out there dark songs that are making people laugh you know  i don't see the point in just playing one of the songs that are just uh... over the top hateful  no that's why i didn't send you a bunch of those but you know how many  you didn't  you know how many hits one of our website gets off of people doing google searches 
[02:30:30]  byron i have no doubt that you're uh... very popular  there's no doubt about it  but it's the the the jokes  the the funny songs and the jokes  there's uh...  probably thirty thousand people a month  right  google search for just  nigger jokes  um... so i mean the the jokes are funny  some people think they're outrageous and offensive  and other people just think they're funny  all right let me let me ask you uh... this about the uh... distribution  of your cds  a lot of controversy here  you're dropping these things off at schools 
[02:31:00]  well what we're doing is we're selling them in bulk or we're just boxing them up and sending them to our people and we've gone we went through our first twenty thousand sampler cds in about twelve days and we ordered the other eighty thousand and we've gone through about ten or fifteen thousand of those and people are basically just distributing them to uh... kids in their area  so what you're saying is hey i'm just boxing them up and send them out to other people who can give them to whoever the hell they want and uh... you know you kind of wash your hands of it after you box them up and send them out  uh... for the most part in other words we're not giving people instructions on where to hand them out 
[02:31:30]  what do you think about these uh... uh... songs uh... going to kids that are you know as young as maybe thirteen or early teens  i think it's great if these kids are old enough to listen to this anti-white rap music  or uh... look at video games like grand theft auto three where kids learn how to beat up hookers and smoke crack and carjack people  i love that we love that game that's great well if the kids are old enough for that they're old enough for our music and uh...  technically they're not but we're like any other company we're distributing samples of our product and i tell you what it's it's huge the kids are eating it up 
[02:32:00]  all right don't doubt it well let's uh... i guess we'll thank byron for giving his point of view today sure  byron thank you any plugs brought uh... byron  nah what the hell they'll find us they got google  all right thank you so much appreciate it man good luck to you buddy  bye-bye  all right  see those um...  good luck to you buddy  good luck to you buddy opie  fucking worm  try to keep some uh...  take care thank you for being on the program 
[02:32:30]  good luck to you  hey godspeed for your lips to god's ears  a little uh...  good luck to him i don't know  good luck to you buddy  try to keep a little neutrality here opie as a journalist  Jesus  hey good luck hey  we're not journalists  fight the power fight the power  fight for the good cause  we're not journalists  if anybody wasn't here you could wink at him and thumbs up him you blonde haired nazi  ha ha ha have a  take it easy perfect race  that was just my way of getting you know  thoughts and prayers  can i tell you how hard it is to actually have to argue in favor of the liberal point of view 
[02:33:00]  jesus it's just that difficult  jesus christ i know  you know you got a back and forth  you know now we can now we can play this song because they told us he only sent us the funny ones  No, he did not send us just the funny one.  How is this song considered funny?  Written in the good old days, I see.  The house next door to me has been sold to niggers. 
[02:33:30]  They claim to be wild Indians from the plains.  Oh, but they ain't a-shuckin' me, they're colored people.  We'll make cowboys and niggers our new game.  Yeah, that's not quite the humor.  Last night when I come home, I was warmly greeted.  But not by my sweet wife saying, hello, dear. 
[02:34:00]  Uh-oh.  Then, steady, it was, hello, dear.  What mamma jammer?  Says, how does you like us dark folks living here?  All right.  Sex solo.  There you have it.  Wow.  To answer your question, how can it be considered funny?  I think it's kind of silly when real estate deals go awry. 
[02:34:30]  Is that what you took out of that song?  Yes, that there was like somebody was supposed to buy the house and the financing got messed  up and somebody else bought the house.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that Anthony and Norton do a much better interview than Larry King,  and I'm not kidding.  Straight up.  Yeah, no, they did great with him.  I mean, honestly, probably the best interview you'll have with that guy in the next few weeks.  Well, you know what it is?  It's really, it's like, obviously, I disagree a lot with what he's saying, and Anthony was  right.  He's like, he does make some valid points. 
[02:35:00]  As a person, you can't just throw a blanket, emotional, knee-jerk reaction statement and  go, oh, you're fucking racist, evil.  You know, there are points that are valid and points that are invalid.  Right, and he's going to do mainstream media, and they're going to have this cause because  they're going to cut him off, and he's not going to be able to have an intelligent  like this question.  Well, that's true, yeah.  I'm serious.  Yeah, if he's on, I don't know, CNN, and he's sitting there doing an interview with  them, they won't even let him get a word in.  They're going to let him get enough rope out to hang himself with.  He'll say a few things, and then they'll just write off everything. 
[02:35:30]  You can't write off everything the guy says, just like you certainly should never agree  with everything somebody says either.  You know, weigh it out.  The guy's right about black people pretty much being able to write songs and being distributed  by major record labels without having to answer for anything.  You know, and that's considered music, and it does win awards, and it's hateful to women.  It's hateful to white people. 
[02:36:00]  It's hateful to any other races besides blacks.  I've heard it before.  You know, I used to listen to Ghetto Boys.  I used to listen to N.W.A., and this stuff is just hateful.  Damn entertaining, I'll say that.  But, you know, you've got to look at the other side.  The guy was making valid points when it comes out.  Some of his points off the fucking wall.  I think the whole reaction that black people doing that kind of hate music and putting it  into song and winning awards, I don't think the answer to it is to then get in your garage 
[02:36:30]  with a bunch of white guys with skinheads and preach, you know, hate in the other direction.  I don't know what the answer is, but I don't think that's it.  I got another example, Anthony.  He said he only sent us songs that were funny.  Right, right.  This one is just brutal.  Brutal.  How is this funny?  Hey, Jew, don't tell me lies about gas chambers in Auschwitz. 
[02:37:00]  Six million chimis are alive with a circumcised sons of daughters and wives.  He's trying to do a Nazi accent.  I hate you, the New Reich is here, and this time it is for real.  Oh, really?  We have to stop your world by desecration of man.  You're Satan's fun and not the chosen. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, Jew, in your synagogue, preaching hatred for the Gentile.  Remember, we know what you're up to, you too.  Zionism is communism.  There's no denying.  Gave up on rhyming and everything.  I don't think the New Reich is going to go very far when it's just guys in a garage. 
[02:38:00]  I'll tell you how it's funny, though.  It makes you realize what it would sound like if Carol Kane sang with the Internet is for Porn Guy.  And it's also nice how they took out the piano and put in the...  Cheesy acoustic.  The guitar, yeah.  The cheesy acoustic guitar.  All right, we've got to take a break.  You sure do, Ope.  Yeah.

I said this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me.  Because we need a little controversy, because it feels so empty without me.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the O&A Virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  They had the balls to hire us, Anthony.  Thank you to get our careers up and running once again. 
[02:45:30]  Florida checking in. It's LD. What's up, LD?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  I'm doing great.  All right.  I just want to let you know, my personality is pretty much a conservative Christian.  And I thought I figured you guys would be another, let's just say Howard.  But they started free play, and I figured, hey, I can hear some hooker jokes.  But no, you guys are just cracking me up.  Oh, thanks.  The butt plug skit did it. I'm ordering. 
[02:46:00]  Butt plug.  All we had to do was play butt plug to get you to sign up for this channel?  Butt plug.  You could have saved us a lot of hours of misery, bro.  Oh, man.  Well, you know, I didn't want to listen to another Howard.  I mean, how many times can you hear about hookers every day?  Well, Jimmy.  Jimmy is.  You never get enough of those hookers.  How many times can you watch your savings count go to the negative?  One thing we don't do is have them come in.  Yeah, no, this show is a lot different than Howard.  It's a lot funnier than Howard.  It's a lot more entertaining than Howard, and it's only a matter of time before everyone realizes that. 
[02:46:30]  It's not a four-hour bitch fest.  No, we're not doing a Lenny Bruce impression right now.  Oh, God.  Well, I'm ordering.  I appreciate you guys cracking me up.  All right, thank you.  Thank you, mister.  That's what destroyed Lenny Bruce's career, when he started talking about all his troubles.  Reading his court transcripts on stage.  Drugs.  Wonderful.  I know Howard's a big fan of Lenny Bruce, and he's fallen into the same trap, just bitching over and over again all day long.  The FCC is crucifying me. 
[02:47:00]  And the only reason he's bitching all day long is he's just run out of energy.  He doesn't really feel like getting an entertaining, funny show together.  You wouldn't either if you were getting $500 million.  Robin, how much are you getting?  $150 a week?  He's an absolute fraud.  It's just a matter of time.  Bob, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, all night?  Hey.  How's it going, Jimmy?  Hello, Bob.  Thanks for calling the program.  Hey, I'm sitting here in Beaumont, Texas right now, and I just got back in my truck, turned 
[02:47:30]  on the XM, and it was cranked up, and it was that part where you guys had that country guy  singing about niggers.  Oh, boy.  And my truck is surrounded by black guys on the forklifts right now.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we've got to apologize to anybody who might have been in a sticky situation.  Yeah, the one thing about this radio show, you've got to stay close to the volume.  To the volume, very close.  We forgot to tell the new listeners.  There are times that you don't want to leave.  You can't have faith in us, bro.  You lunge for it in slow motion. 
[02:48:00]  No!  It's safe to say you've got to be about 10 feet away from the volume at all times.  Sometimes we try to warn you guys, but other times, you know, we have a safe little, cute  little discussion going, and then all of a sudden we go into the dark side, man.  It goes really wrong, yeah.  Yeah, there's two of them that definitely heard it.  They, they, and when I turned it on, he was saying nigger, and I don't know what the rest  of it was.  I turned it down, but it was just really loud nigger.  All right.  All right, boy.  You probably thought it was your CD. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  A little goddamn trucker racist son of a bitch.  What you listen to on the way to work?  What up, Jeff?  I know, those goddamn truckers.  I can't stand them.  All right.  I just want to tell you guys, I love you guys.  I never heard of y'all before.  Yesterday, I started listening.  I'm going to call my wife as soon as we get off the phone, and I'm going to pay for two  years up front.  Oh, thank you, sir.  I feel like it's a telethon right now.  Thank you for the pledge.  You raised two dollars.  You know, two years will cost you 48 whole dollars.  Whoa. 
[02:49:00]  Whoa.  Let's slow down a little bit.  I tell you what, I never laughed so damn hard, I thought I was going to pee myself  listening to the retard singing Dirty Dancing.  Oh, cool.  Thanks.  Isn't that a good one?  We've only scratched the surface.  We've got a lot of ugly stuff to play for you guys.  As a matter of fact, the faithful listeners, maybe you can suggest some of the things we  could play going into break to convert these guys.  Thanks, Jeff.  Thank you, sir.  That's what we've been trying to tell XM Satellite Radio for a long time.  People just don't know who we are.  You give them samples all over the platform, and you'll get people signing up like crazy.  Ah, but let me tell you something. 
[02:49:30]  The next time he's been doing a good job at the marketing, they got a guy right now  off exit 240 in Long Island, handing out stickers.  That's great.  Yeah, exit 69 of the Long Island Expressway.  There's a sticker stop going on.  Yeah.  If you're out there.  I don't know what time it is there or anything, because the time changes somewhere in Suffolk  County.  I think so, yeah.  I think it's another time zone.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Another day.  Definitely.  It's right by Plum Island Research Center.  Oh, yes. 
[02:50:00]  The Disease Island.  Let's say hi to Carrie in Jacksonville, Florida.  Carrie, what's up?  Hey, not much.  Now that you waited over an hour, what do you have for the program?  I don't know.  Oh, she doesn't know.  You don't know?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Carrie.  You've been on hold for about an hour.  I have.  I thought I was going to play a game.  You want to play a game?  Mm-hmm.  What do you want to play?  Do you want to play yay? 
[02:50:30]  Hello, Joshua.  Carrie, if you weren't our first and probably only chick to call the program today, we would  have hung up on you a minute ago.  What game do you want to play, miss?  I want to play What's in Your Pants.  Okay.  Oh.  Now we're talking.  All right.  Guess What's in My Pants.  Do you know how to play Guess What's in My Pants?  No, but I heard about it.  How did you hear about it?  From a friend.  Okay.  From a friend.  Is this game sweeping the country? 
[02:51:00]  It is sweeping the nation, Opie.  Okay.  Carrie, how old a gal are you?  I'm 33.  She's 33 years old.  Guess what's in my slacks?  Guess what's in my handsome pantsuit?  Guess what's in my mom jeans?  Guess what's in my smart business attire?  Here, guess what's in my pants.  33.  33.  She's from Jacksonville.  From Jacksonville.  And here, here we go.  You got any kids?  I do.  How many?  Just one. 
[02:51:30]  Just one.  All right.  We're still there.  All right.  All right.  You take care of yourself?  Of course.  You're cute?  Of course.  Have you ever seen what a 33-year-old woman looks like in Jacksonville, by the way?  No, I haven't.  Oh, it got all quiet.  No, we're still here.  We're still here.  We're here.  So you're 33 with one kid.  And how tall a gal are you?  I'm 5'3".  5'3".  Cool.  All right.  She's petite.  Very petite.  That's petite.  How much you weigh? 
[02:52:00]  112.  All right.  You're hanging in there.  She's still there.  She's still there, eh?  All right.  And you don't have, like, the peacock hairdo thing, do you?  The peacock hairdo.  No.  You spray it in front.  That's a very popular hairstyle in Jacksonville.  Make it look like you have a lot of hair.  They spray it in the front.  Also known as the hair waterfall, yeah.  No.  No?  Okay.  All right.  Now, we have to ask this question.  Oh, go ahead.  This isn't just for, you know, shock value.  It kind of gives us a little idea of your frame based on your height and weight. 
[02:52:30]  What size?  What's your bra size?  38 double D.  Oh, okay.  See?  Now, that changes everything.  38 double D?  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a lot of upper body.  Okay.  That's a lot of upper body.  See?  All of a sudden, we get a better idea because based on your height and weight, you don't  weigh that much.  It's very top heavy.  But you're top heavy.  Let me tell you something.  Opie is holding the button down.  To all the amateurs out there, a lot of guys out there, they hear 38 and they think 
[02:53:00]  that's what makes a girl have big boobs.  Are you still there, Kerry?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on a second.  We're having a technical problem.  So they hear 38 and they think, wow, the girl has huge boobs.  No, 38 is the back.  Right.  That's how big the back is.  Right.  She probably has that roll of blubber like when the bra is on.  If you feel the back, you can probably feel the bra indent and then the fat around it.  That roll that comes out under the bra.  She may have back boobs.  All right?  The double D, that's the number you want to hear.  So, yeah, she has huge boobs, but they're on a pretty big back for a girl that's 5'3". 
[02:53:30]  5'3", and how much did she weigh?  112.  112.  That's all upper body.  That's 120, by the way.  Hey, Kerry.  Right.  Cool.  Something doesn't match up.  You're 5'3", 112 pounds, 38 double D.  I'm starting to think, what happened?  I think I hear the radio on the back.  No, no, no.  It can't possibly be.  Kerry, do you have your radio on in the background?  No.  Okay.  You got to turn it down because there's a delay.  There's a delay.  Do you have legs?  Yeah, I have legs.  Well, something's not matching up here. 
[02:54:00]  A lot of money paid out.  What?  A lot of money paid out.  Are they fake?  Yes, they're fake.  What size were they before you had those put in?  I was a D cup.  Wow, you didn't get attention growing up.  But 38, so you kind of have a wide back, right?  That's all right.  No, it's okay.  We're just trying to get the visual for the radio.  Trying to get a little visual on you.  How big are your hips? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Tiny, right?  What's your pants size?  What do you need?  I'm a pants, like a six.  I'm starting to think you look like SpongeBob SquarePants with boobs.  You don't know how to play the game yet?  Oh, yeah, Anthony, come on.  Let's go.  You're going to ruin it.  Right, okay.  What's wrong with you?  Okay, guess what's in my pants? 
[02:55:00]  Someone's saying there's no way you're 112 pounds.  Something's not matching up, but that's okay.  We don't care.  We like all women, right, Anthony?  Absolutely, Opie.  We're all inclusive on this program.  All ages, all races, and all sizes.  Right.  Even when shaped like squares.  Exactly.  All right.  Whatever.  Carrie?  Yep.  Oh, she said whatever.  She's not very happy with you, Opie.  Yeah, I know.  You shouldn't criticize her like that.  I can't believe you.  I'm sorry.  I paid a lot of money for these.  What's that?  I paid a lot of money for these. 
[02:55:30]  For the boobs.  No, I'm sure you look lovely.  And I used to be heavy, but I lost a lot of weight.  I don't know why you would go double D. That's very big on a short girl. Very big.  That is really big.  Very big.  Are they pert, or are they kind of hanging?  They hang a little bit. I wish I wouldn't have gone what I did.  How long ago did you get them?  Two years.  You got them on your, what, 30th birthday or something?  Well, almost.  You turned 30 and lost your fucking mind and decided, you know, it was time to get the guys back again, 
[02:56:00]  like you remember, in your 20s or something?  I was with a jackass.  You were with a jackass?  I was with a jackass.  Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that.  It was supposed to be a morale booster, you know.  So he, wait, wait, did he kind of make you get boobs, or you got it after you broke up?  I got it after I broke up.  Yeah, she broke up.  How long of a relationship? Long one?  We were together for eight years.  Yeah, eight years.  She breaks up, goes and gets huge boobs. 
[02:56:30]  Yep.  You women are like sheep.  There's some of you, you could read them like a book.  Did you ever...  Just doing these stupid things.  Why would you do that?  Because it was a stupid thing.  And I thought I'd get a better type of guy with bigger tits.  She raises a good point.  Wow.  I like that.  A better type of guy.  She's right.  Not at all, man.  You need a better class of people.  Not at all.  Shut up, you do not.  So you're 38, double D. Did you ever get hurt helping someone load a couch into a van? 
[02:57:00]  I wouldn't help someone load a couch into a van.  Would you?  Wait, were you about 14?  I don't know.  I think you're...  I hurt my arm.  I think if you're...  I don't know.  I think you're going to attract perverts, really.  With huge boobs on a small frame.  Yeah, you probably got a lower class of gentlemen that...  Don't you want guys to look you in the eye?  I thought I did.  She's 5'3".  I mean, I thought they would.  But they...  It was stupid.  All right, let's say hi to Julie real fast.  Julie, what's up? 
[02:57:30]  She's lying.  Why?  Because, I mean, come on.  38, double D?  She's not as small as she says.  Absolutely not.  Yeah, how much do you really weigh, Curry?  It's okay.  We don't care.  We're all friends here.  130.  Okay.  All right.  That's more realistic.  You said 112.  Yeah, so what?  Women always lie about their weight.  You fat pig!  No.  So, you know what?  I mean, it happens that you're going to...  She exaggerated a little bit. 
[02:58:00]  At 130, I'm fat.  What's that?  At 130, I'm fat.  No, you're not.  No, you're not at all.  I wouldn't fuck you at gunpoint, fatso.  Anyway, are you going to play?  It's all in the eye of the beholder.  Of course it is.  Yes.  Yeah, weight doesn't mean anything.  Did you get those...  Not when there's true love.  When does weight not mean anything to you guys?  It does.  It means nothing to me.  Oh, come on.  I've totally seen you guys hang up on the phone.  It means nothing.  Julie, we're desperate today.  Just go with us.  That's not true. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, I want to play...  Listen, can we just stop this silliness and play What's in My House Dress?  Please?  All right, Julie.  Thank you.  No problem.  Yeah, we knew something wasn't matching up there.  Needed another girl on the line to get that info out.  Absolutely.  Let's play Guess What's in My Tent.  All right.  Carrie?  Yep.  Yeah.  You got the big boobs to kind of offset your butt, didn't you?  You figured it would be a little better.  If you were bigger on top, it would kind of proportion the rest of your body, right? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, it evens out the bunt.  So when you're laying on your back, now you look like a W.  Does your body look like there's a midget inside trying to punch his way out?  I think we have another girl on the line that says she's fibbing about something.  Oh, really?  Okay, let's go to Selena.  Selena?  Yeah?  What's going on?  What do you want to say to Carrie?  She is a fucking liar.  Why, Selena?  I've been in retail for 10 years, and 112, a size 6, she's a fucking trapezoid. 
[02:59:30]  Well, she says now that she's 130 pounds.  Yeah.  She'll fess up to 130.  130.  By the end of the call, she'll admit that she's 150.  Don't worry.  And I think experts work.  She's got to be at least 150.  150.  Yeah, because...  38 double Ds?  Yeah, that's where...  Yeah, exactly.  Double Ds.  That means you're probably not even 130, right, Carrie?  A 130 is like a 34, a 36 maybe.  Carrie? 
[03:00:00]  I'm a 38.  Carrie?  I'm a 38.  Are you closer to 150 than you are 130?  No.  Because every girl lies about their age.  So if you're admitting to 130, that means you're probably a little more than 130.  Let's compromise.  149.  What do you...  I'll compromise to 140.  140.  140?  All right.  We got her up to 140 now.  It's 140.  It's 140.  Let's go for 150.  It's 140.  It's like an auctioneer.  120, 120, gone.  Gone, gone.  When she was 18.  125, 125, 135, 130. 
[03:00:30]  This girl has gained 28 pounds in five minutes.  So listen, what happens is you're right.  Men really are very, very like...  Men can be really physical.  No wonder he left.  He probably left you for somebody thinner, you fat fuck.  And you know what it is?  It's like a lot of times guys only look at the outside instead of the inside.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure you have a lovely personality, right?  By the way, when it hits 147 and a half, call my broker and sell.  Okay.  Okay?  Carrie.  Yep.  You don't know how to play the game?  No, sir. 
[03:01:00]  But you heard from my friend.  I forgot how to play the game myself.  It's been so long.  We have to play.  Guess what's in my pants?  I got amnesia.  Did we even ever play this game?  This is a fun game.  Yeah, sure.  And Carrie called to play.  And I think we should let her play.  After an hour, come on guys, let me play.  We want to play.  I want to play.  Of course we're going to have you play.  Yeah.  Now the rules are...  Well, first of all, where are you right now? 
[03:01:30]  At a buffet.  I am sitting in my car.  You're sitting in your car?  Yep.  Are you in front of work, your house, driving?  I'm waiting to pick up one of my friends.  Uh-huh.  And where are you guys going?  Christmas shopping.  Oh.  So you're going Christmas shopping with your friend?  And where is she right now?  She's a he.  Wait, watchers.  Huh?  Oh, it's a he?  It's a he?  Yep.  And he's just a friend?  Yeah.  See, we have a problem with that, too. 
[03:02:00]  Oh.  No guy can really truly be a friend with a girl.  Well, maybe.  Unless he's gay.  He's younger than me.  Is he gay?  He's younger than me.  No.  Oh, hell no.  All right.  He's younger than you.  How old is he?  He's younger than me.  He's 23.  Uh-oh.  Oh, look at that.  How did you guys meet?  I worked at a trucking company that his dad worked at, and I kind of adopted him into the  family.  And when I left my asshole, I took him with me.  He was his friend, and I decided, no, he's mine now. 
[03:02:30]  Did you ever sleep with him once on some drunk night at your house?  Oh, hell no.  It would be like incest.  Well, you are from Jacksonville, Florida.  So what's the Chubby Chaser's name?  Huh?  Nothing.  What's his name?  Yeah, what's his name?  Michael.  Michael.  What's this guy whose fear of being left since childhood do for a living?  He's a truck driver.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Are you really 140?  You've got to come clean now, or we can't play the game.  Oh, for Christ's sake.  It's really in the rules. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  It's right here.  That's it.  It's in the rule book, and we have to know really within just a pound or two, so we can't  be off.  Even if it's...  Because I know a lot of girls...  It's going to affect the results of the game.  Absolutely.  I know a lot of girls don't want to fess up to 150, because that's kind of a benchmark  number.  So you could keep it in the high 140s, but be a little honest.  Just be honest.  It doesn't matter.  I'm a mess.  No one...  146.  All right.  All right.  146.  Cool.  All right.  We're up to 146.  You started this call on Earth, and now you're on Jupiter. 
[03:03:30]  146.  I like that.  Well, you've gained 34 pounds in seven minutes.  She's being honest.  Wow.  I'm bloated.  Leave me alone.  It's Ralphie Mae on the phone.  Right.  What'd you have for lunch?  A cracker with a 10-year-old on it?  Not lately.  Okay.  So you're in an area that's kind of private?  Yeah.  Is it safe to say that girls will take 10 pounds off their weight just for the hell  of it? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  No matter what they say their weight is.  So if you say 146, it could be 156.  I'm going to say 156.  156?  You'd be way...  You'd be high.  You'd be high?  A little high?  All right.  So 146 is a little low.  156 is high.  Yeah.  146 is almost there.  156 is pretty high.  So should we split the difference?  151, I guarantee, is accurate.  Would you be willing to say 151 is the closest we have been to your weight? 
[03:04:30]  Maybe.  If we take a pound off...  Take a pound off.  All right.  All right.  So we are one-fifth.  So the official weight is 150.  Is that safe?  Is everyone on the same page?  Actually, last time I weighed myself, it was 149.  149.  149.  But did you eat breakfast yet?  No.  You weigh yourself naked and hungry?  That's the only way to weigh yourself if you're a woman.  All right.  So, all right.  But you probably have about two to three pounds of clothes on right now.  We'll give you 152. 
[03:05:00]  That's fine.  That's fair, I think.  152 with clothes on.  With your clothes.  You are 40 pounds heavier than when we first started this call.  All right.  So, Lawrence, one of Arabia.  Okay, Carrie.  So you're in somewhere private.  Yes.  And what are you wearing?  Are you wearing pants or a skirt?  Pants.  Pants.  You're in your car?  Yes.  Now, oh, you're behind the steering wheel?  This could be difficult.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  You might want to move the seat back a little bit.  Okay.  All right.  Guess what's in my pants?  The cruise control.  Yeah, you're going to have to, like, maybe push the steering wheel away a little bit because  we need access to your panty-covered region.  Yeah, you might want to hang upside down.  So, is there any way you could slip your pants down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Give that a try.  Hold on.  Tell us.  And your boxer briefs. 
[03:06:00]  How you make out.  What type of panties are you wearing?  T-backs.  T-backs.  T-backs?  Oh.  Did you say T-backs?  Or you're built like a T-Rex?  Oh.  T-string.  I think.  T-string.  T-string.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah.  That's a good door.  Gee.  Yeah.  All right.  Rick the trucker goes, tell her to come to Iowa.  She'll think she's thin.  Oh.  I've been to Iowa. 
[03:06:30]  Can you let us know when your pants are pulled down to your ankles?  Well, yeah.  You almost got them past the fat thighs?  Yeah.  I don't have fat thighs.  Opie.  I'm sorry.  Now, we need them.  Yeah.  We need them down enough so you'll have access to your womanly area.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Now, your T-back, can you pull that aside?  Or you better just pull that down, too.  Okay.  We need you sitting there with your pants and panties kind of off of your most intimates. 
[03:07:00]  Hold on a minute.  Yes.  Can you get naked?  We'll be right back.  James.  Here I am.  James Remar.  It's James Remar.  Good morning.  How are you, buddy?  It's early.  Yes, it is.  Are you in L.A.?  I'm on the West Coast.  Oh, my God.  Then it is really ridiculous early.  The sun isn't up.  You're going to do this all day, aren't you?  No. 
[03:07:30]  He goes, no.  He's like right back to bed after this one.  I'm in bed.  Oh, you are?  He's still in bed.  Oh, James Remar in bed.  Yeah.  What are you wearing?  Nothing.  Thanks for the visual.  My favorite outfit.  This is the part where he's in bed with the girl and Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte barge in,  try to shoot him.  God damn, I love this guy.  I loved it.  48 Hours, by the way.  You are the best villain ever, ever in any movie. 
[03:08:00]  Gans.  Thank you.  I mean, probably most recognized for that one, I bet, right?  Well, since Sex and the City, it's been a backseat for a while.  Yeah, because that's what I'm hearing from everybody.  They're like, oh, yeah, you seem in Sex and the City.  And to tell you the truth, I wasn't a big fan of the Sex and the City show.  A lot of chicks watch that.  But I would go, oh, that guy.  I'd rather be more popular with them than you anyway.  Well, of course you would.  We're in the Warriors, too, right?  Yeah, he's in the Warriors.  He was the guy that was like, oh, why are you trying to pick up the chick in the park, 
[03:08:30]  you idiot?  Stay with your boys.  And then he gets handcuffed to the bench and the cops come.  The Lust Factor.  Yeah, I know.  You couldn't keep it in your pants.  Well, I could.  It was pulling me in a certain direction.  What did he do on Sex and the City?  Ben knows.  You watched that girl show, didn't you, Ben?  Oh, he does, too.  He probably has a girlfriend, and he watched it.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's just put it this way.  I gave up on Sex and the City.  He got to bang Kim Cattrall on the show. 
[03:09:00]  One of the many, I guess, that banged Kim Cattrall.  But I did it consistently.  Oh, you were like the steady kind of?  Yeah, I was a boyfriend.  Yeah.  Did you have to do scenes with her kind of naked in bed?  Kind of, yeah.  It was completely naked in bed?  Well, she looks really hot for her age, man.  Well, so do I.  We already had gotten to that, James.  We were talking about that.  You're laying in that Hollywood bed of yours right now.  Actually overlooking Hollywood Boulevard.  Oh, I love it. 
[03:09:30]  The premiere was last night.  Oh, yeah, you're in Blade, right?  Mm-hmm.  I love the Blade movies.  One and two are great.  What's the spin on this one?  This is, how do you mean the spin?  Yeah, what's like the storyline on this one?  Well, it's a Blade movie.  It's Vampires vs. Blade.  And what are you?  I'm actually the real world.  I play an FBI guy who doesn't believe in vampires.  Really?  And then I guess you kind of get convinced. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, at the end, at the end, I'm convinced.  It's just this incredible body count.  Can you give us the ending of the movie?  I'm convinced.  He's convinced.  We're all convinced by the end.  That's the end.  You didn't have to learn any sword play like the rest of the guys, did you?  Unfortunately not.  That would have been great.  That is pretty cool, man.  They're swinging those things around.  Those movies are really good.  That would have been a blast.  I'd love to have done that.  Is everybody else from the other movies, aside from those that saw Sunlight and Burnt Away, 
[03:10:30]  are they coming back?  The ones that are all ashed away already?  Yeah.  I don't know how they could.  Well, not them.  The other ones, though.  Like, what's-his-name is in that?  No, Wesley Snipes.  I know.  He's like the star.  What's-his-name is coming back.  What's-his-name will be back.  No, Wesley Snipes.  What's-his-name and who's-her-face?  They'll both be back.  No, who's the Bobby McGee author guy?  Oh, Chris Christopherson.  Chris Christopherson.  I can never remember that son of a bitch's name. 
[03:11:00]  God.  You know, he has nothing but nice things to say about you.  Oh, and I badmouth him like that.  I know him as the Bobby McGee author guy.  What a dick.  And I'm going to remind him because I think he's going to be on our show in the coming days.  Is he really?  Chris Christopherson is, yeah, he's in it.  He's back, so we'll see the whole cast.  Very good.  What else are you working on, Jay?  I'm doing North Shore for Fox.  We're finishing up the season over there in Hawaii.  I'm going back this morning, actually. 
[03:11:30]  Cool.  What a life.  You know, we were in the middle of playing Guess What's in My Pants with a fatty from Jacksonville,  and we interrupted the call to talk to you.  I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  Sure.  Is Gans and the Warriors, are they like the things that you're most recognized for?  Yeah.  Well, with old guys like you, now the kids.  Now the kids.  Well, no, like I was saying, there's a few James Remar fans out there who know everything, 
[03:12:00]  but most everybody pretty much knows the Warriors and the 48 Hours, like you said.  But lately, Sex and the City gave me a new level of recognizability.  I mean, that's good also you didn't get typecasts and stuff,  because you were pretty much the premier bad guy scumbag of the 80s.  Yeah.  Well, there are some lesser-known flicks kicking around,  and where I am scumbagging it around pretty happily.  I've been wanting to ask you this for a long time. 
[03:12:30]  When you shot Luther on that bus,  did you shoot him just because he asked the girl if she was okay,  and you said she'd be okay?  I always wondered, if he didn't ask, are you okay, would Gans have shot him?  History, man.  Who can tell?  What a dick question that was.  I think he needed shooting.  Of course he did.  Very good.  At that particular point, he really needed shooting.  Wait, someone wants to say hi to you.  She might have been with you.  Yeah, she might have been with you. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, girl.  Nice.  Janine, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say hi to James Remar.  I'm such a big fan since the Ajax days.  Oh, cool.  I'm a fan of your, too.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ajax, lighten up.  That's all we say at my house constantly.  Constantly.  That's it.  What a household.  Yeah, we're losers.  We're losers.  That's funny.  We're chasing each other around.  Chasing each other around the park.  Yeah, I'm sick of waiting for trains.  That's all right.  As long as you don't live with a black guy and yell riff. 
[03:13:30]  Riffs.  They were cool.  Hell yeah.  I had no idea you were going to be on the show.  I almost drove off the road.  I'm so glad there was an accident on 135.  I think we've got to start promoting the fact that we're going to have big names on our show.  I know.  That would be good.  Very cool.  All right.  Thank you, Janine.  Thank you.  All right.  I think James can get back to sleep now.  We've got Blade, Trinity.  I've been asleep this whole time.  Yeah, I know.  Well, that's why we're saying go back.  No, I'm just kidding.  It's awesome.  Check out James and Blade, Trinity. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, please do.  When does that come out?  Today.  Is it out?  It comes out today, right?  Yeah, I think today's the opening day.  Is it getting good reviews?  I don't even know.  Beg pardon?  Is it getting good reviews, the movie?  Hell yeah.  Blade movies are huge, man.  I'm just asking.  They're huge.  Don't be an ass.  I haven't read the reviews.  We just saw it last night, and it's full of action.  That's for sure.  All right.  Good.  Cole, thanks a lot, James.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes. 
[03:14:30]  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Take care, man.  James Remar.  James Remar, dude.  This is what an idiot I am.  Like, I saw the picture, and I didn't recognize that he was Gans.  Gans!  Or Ajax.  I had no idea.  If I'm looking at the thing, I'm like, oh, this guy's got 75 credits.  He's great.  Gans was the best character in a movie.  Yeah.  Nice gun.  And he just shoots the guy.  Oh, yeah.  He was a...  Just a scumbag.  Just a creep.  Didn't care.  Him with the Indian guy with the big knife.  Oh, the movie's great.  All right.  Let's get back to Carrie.  Carrie?  Yep.  Are you naked?  Well, from the bottom down. 
[03:15:00]  She's got her bottoms off.  That's fine.  That's the important part.  All right.  So, how do we play Guess What's in My Pants?  Carrie, we are going to instruct you to take your cell phone and rub it, as per our direction,  on your most intimate of areas.  And then, judging by the sound, we will try to guess what type of hairstyle you're sporting  down there.  The choices are a basic standard issue triangle, the landing strip or mohawk, self-explanatory, 
[03:15:30]  it's just a strip of hair, the Hitler mustache.  Which is a little tuft of hair that is above the area.  Lip of Byron.  Right.  The lip of Byron.  Or the, also popular now, clean-shaved wood floor, or as we like to call it, Lil' Connor  Peterson.  Lil' Connor's armpit.  Jesus.  Now, Carrie, a very important part of this game is you must not even hint to us what 
[03:16:00]  you're sporting down there until we ask you what indeed is in your pants, okay?  We didn't play the theme song.  Oh, the theme song, of course.  Hit it.  That gets you all psyched for the game.  Boom, boom, boom.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[03:16:30]  It's time to guess.  What's in my pants?  My pants.  All right, Carrie?  Yep.  All right, are you ready to take the phone, put it down there, and rub as per our instruction?  Okay.  All right, we want you to do it up and down.  An up and down movement on your area, please.  Wrong stroke.  Pain of the fence. 
[03:17:00]  Hmm.  More?  Well, no, I heard that.  It almost sounded like it ran over a yodel down there, but I did hear it.  We need you to rub side to side.  Show me paint the fence.  Side to side, please. 
[03:17:30]  Okay.  Okay, now we need you to take the phone and rub it in a circular fashion.  Wax on.  Wax off.  Mm-hmm.  A little rough.  Okay.  Can I hear up and down again, ma'am?  Sand the floor.  Hold on.  It's the most exercise she's gotten in four years. 
[03:18:00]  All right.  Can you do that?  I'm sorry to bother you, but I had to make a joke at the expense of your rubbing.  Could you just do that one more time?  Yeah.  I apologize.  My fault.  My fault.  Hold on.  Someone wants to know if you look like the Kool-Aid guy.  Okay. 
[03:18:30]  You know what?  I really don't care what you have in your face.  Oh, Opie, stop.  It's a game, and our listeners are depending on us.  I'm going to guess concrete patio.  Okay.  Does everybody have enough information?  This is a guess.  Opie?  You know, I have no doubt in my mind.  You don't?  Yeah, it's a wood floor.  Opie's saying wood floor.  Jimmy Norton?  I'm going to guess a wood floor with a five o'clock shadow that smells like the breath 
[03:19:00]  of a basset hound.  All right.  Judging by the sound, my first instinct is to go at what Opie said, wood floor, but I'm  going to use some more information that we got from this call.  Her not knowing how the game was played and calling up, perhaps she just isn't prepared  and doesn't even know that she should shave down there. 
[03:19:30]  So I'm just going to say the standard issue, girl triangle.  Okay.  Carrie, if you could, please tell us what indeed is in your pants.  It's shaved.  It is completely shaved?  Yeah.  It was obvious.  It's a wood floor.  It's so obvious.  I was going out on a limb there trying to get the extra point.  She lacks self-confidence, so she knows that's the popular hairstyle, so she went with it.  The circular thing almost had me go on Hitler Mustard.  And I'm thinking she might even spend some time in strip clubs and has seen what the 
[03:20:00]  ladies are sporting, the big boobs and the shaved you-know-what, and it's like, if I look  like that, I'm going to get a real fine gentleman, right?  Yeah.  That does make sense.  Do you hang out in strip clubs?  I've gone to a few of them.  There you go.  She's gone to a few.  I could be a profiler.  Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?  Did he sodomize you?  No, he's very decent.  Well, Carrie, you've been a lot of fun, I do believe.  Well, thank you.  I really appreciate all 160 pounds of you calling in today. 
[03:20:30]  You didn't think me.  Well, she'll fess up to 152, so.  Carrie, before-  Well, I said I'd fess up to 149.  Yeah, but-  That's without clothes.  And before breakfast.  Before we go, really, you're going to hang up.  We'll never hear from you again.  How much do you weigh?  149.  On it.  149 naked before breakfast.  And you're 5'1"?  No, I'm 5'3".  All right.  How tall standing up?  I'm not on your back. 
[03:21:00]  Do what?  All right.  We could actually get a really accurate measurement of her weight if she has a tape measure.  Can you measure how far up the car goes when you get out of it?  And then we'll just call the dealer and find out what the pressure is in the shock absorbers.  We could do this.  Do you and your trucker boyfriend, I've got to ask you, do you guys ever play truck where  he dresses like a cab and then makes you put on an Exxon shirt and give him a Hummer?  Oh, let's let Carrie go.  Carrie, thanks for playing.  Guess what's in my pants. 
[03:21:30]  Bum, bum, bum.  He's time to play.  He's time to play.  He's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Place the receiver up on your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  He's time to guess what's in my pants.  Sorry.  I love that one.  I really know.  She was good. 
[03:22:00]  She was good-natured.  Good sport.  Good sport.  Jovial.  She was jolly.  Jolly.  What type of people are jolly, Jim?  Floridians.  Right.  I told the listeners to help me out with some requests for the new listeners.  Have they?  No.  They haven't stepped up?  We could play Bill's Dead.  We could play...  I can't believe we had Gans on the phone.  That was great.  And we barely talked to the guy because we were distracted with the whole Kerry thing.  We could play They Call My Names Bill. 
[03:22:30]  What do you want to hear, Ant?  I like They Call My Names Bill.  Yeah?  I don't know if we've played it, huh?  Have we?  Oh, Jim just got another stack full of Tony Danza message board posts from some of our listeners  that have invaded the message board.  What are they doing now?  This is from Connor...  This is from Connor Peterson.  Jim is obsessed with the Peterson trial.  He said, Dad showed Mom who's the boss.  He took her fishing. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, my God.  Who's the boss?  He's turning red.  Look at you.  He's red.  Oh, my God.  Dude, let it sit there.  You're not going to beat that one until we get back from break.

You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet. 
[03:24:30]  You're lost?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's an 8.  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No, do not hang up. 
[03:25:00]  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  Cold like Brazil.  Wait, do you know?  I believe I need a changing.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet?  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay.  Well, you just stay on the phone.  I need a changing and my nurse isn't here.  And do you know the phone number where you are?  Can you tell me the number?  Can you see me?  I'm going to walk across the street now. 
[03:25:30]  No, stay on the phone.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't  talk to you.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam? 
[03:26:00]  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a Coke, and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street.  All right.  Here I go.  I know.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:26:30]  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police while we had him.  He wasn't doing any good.  He's still here.  Call the police.  He probably will tip on the phone.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down and walk.  He dropped the phone.  And he did not hang up.  Oh, my God.  Somebody call an ambulance.  See?  I told you.  Oh, this is horrible.  My God.  He looks awful.  Jesus.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance.  Help over here.  The man got hit. 
[03:27:00]  This is horrible.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess.  The man got hit.  Someone call an ambulance.  Don't touch him.  Leave him down there.  Hello?  Can you give me...  Tell me where you are.  It's too late.  It's too late.  There's bad spirit all over the road.  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late.  I thought you got a shovel.  All right.  Well, get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late.  It isn't too late. 
[03:27:30]  You can't help anymore.  Just bring a shovel.  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland.  In Disneyland.  Can you tell me where in Disneyland?  Pirates of the Caribbean.  In the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  A pirate's life for me.  I'm okay now.  You're okay?  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine, Bill.  You had me really worried. 
[03:28:00]  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill?  Jupiter.  On Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter?  23 Jupiter.  23 Jupiter.  23.  Okay.  Do you live there?  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab, but just tell me where to send it.  Just tell them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter. 
[03:28:30]  28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now?  Masturbating.  Oh, I see.  I was walking down the street and some construction guy was shouting at me.  Hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors.  And was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.

There'll be free coffee, donuts, and Wow Stickers for the first 100 people who show up.  Whoa!  Those aren't real.  Here's the thing on.  T-shirts are there for the first 10 ladies that Wow Rob.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound. 
[03:31:00]  The Wow Sticker Stop.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, this Willie.  Can I help you?  Yes, I would like to see.  Is there a way I can find out which date that I applied for a loan?  You want to find out when you applied for your loan?  Yeah, the date that I applied.  You took out a loan with us?  Yeah.  Look on your calendar.  On my what?  Look on your damn calendar.  Why can't you look on your calendar? 
[03:31:30]  Well, what kind of fucking customer service representative you, is you telling me to look at a calendar?  Hey, don't be talking to me that way, bitch.  I just asked you to tell you to look on your calendar.  You don't know when the hell you took out your loan?  What's your loan number?  I'll look it up for you.  None of your fucking business, you faggot ass pig.  And that's why you're working in customer service.  Kiss my hairy ass.  I'm sitting on your fat, lazy, stinking, nasty behind that.  You think you were talking about this kind of gibberish?  Your lips flapping in the wind. 
[03:32:00]  Buying rubbers has to be the most embarrassing thing in the world for guys.  And the second most embarrassing thing is when we're going to the supermarket and the girl  goes, hey, listen, since you're already going to the store, could you buy me a bottle of that water and vinegar stuff?  And you'll buy like 55 items and that computer scanner will read every one except this one thing.  It's a beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Price check.  I think it was 10 bucks.  10 bucks?  There's no way this is $10. 
[03:32:30]  I'll pay 20.  Just ring it up right now.  We can't charge you $20 for this.  Price check on this one quart water and vinegar deuce.  Forget it.  I don't want the deuce.  Forget it.  He doesn't want the deuce.  I remember once I went to buy rubbers.  I'm waiting in line.  Get up to the counter.  The druggist walks away and this girl comes up.  Hi, can I help you?  Can I talk to him for a minute?  She said, why?  You want to buy rubbers? 
[03:33:00]  Bill, come here.  I think he wants to buy rubbers.  People are looking at me like, aren't you the deuce guy from the supermarket?  XM202, the O.P. and Anthony show.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Iowa.  Kevin, what's up, buddy?  Oh, we lost Kevin.  All right, no big deal.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  That's right.  A lot of people checking out the show for free this week. 
[03:33:30]  Free.  It's the free play week.  Hope you're enjoying the program.  I say they ought to do the free play week every week concurrently for three years.  That would be really good.  But that would mean being smart about something.  Yes, that would be giving them this show for free.  Nah, but you don't want that, though.  Because what's going to happen then is people flip through the radios and fall on the show  and get exposed to it, and then wind up staying with XM longer because they get addicted to the show.  Yeah.  Plus, who needs all that advertising? 
[03:34:00]  Telling more of their friends, and then they get XM.  Bad move.  Bad move.  You always hide a good show.  Better, better.  Better, better.  Hey, we got that guy from 98 Degrees calling in in a few minutes.  We're starting to get guests on the show, Anthony.  Have you noticed?  I have.  Slowly but surely.  It's that guy.  It's Jeff Timmons.  Yeah, it's not Nick Lachey.  Well, that's why I said that guy, and then I'm thinking everyone's going to just stay  tuned, thinking they got Nick, and they get Jeff instead.  We get like the other guy from Wham guy.  We always get the other guy. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Whatever his name was.  What the hell was his name?  Who?  Who was the other guy from Wham?  It was George Michael.  Is this another gay quiz?  If you know the answer, you're gay.  Oh, hey.  Look who's on the phone.  What?  Oh, hey.  I didn't know you.  Hey, Jeff.  Yeah?  You're talking to Opie and Anthony.  We didn't know you were calling right now, but that's fine.  What's going on, buddy?  I don't know.  I just got this message that I was supposed to call you.  Sorry about the other guy.  You know, you could get Nick.  He's the cooler guy.  No, not at all, man. 
[03:35:00]  Let me tell you something.  You weren't supposed to hear any of that shit.  I don't know about the other guy.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Why are you putting these people through when they're on hold while we're bad-mouthing people?  Don't you know the protocol?  I was on TV the other day.  You know, you guys can go ahead.  You know the protocol, guys.  You don't let them listen to the pre-interview.  I like that.  No, Jeff, you want...  Let's you take the temperature on how it's going to be when I'm on the air with you guys.  No, Jeff, trust me.  We're going to get along.  I guarantee it.  You got a solo CD coming out. 
[03:35:30]  Whisper that way.  See?  There you go.  There's a plug and everything.  All right, cool.  All right.  If you really want to get into this, I'll tell you something.  I think Nick is kind of pussy-whipped.  You think?  I think...  I don't find Nick cool whatsoever.  I thought you were going to say you don't find him cute.  I think Nick is not getting good sex at home.  You don't think?  Not at all, man.  Not at all.  It's hard to say, man.  And I don't think he's getting stimulating conversation, I do believe. 
[03:36:00]  Stimulating conversation.  And I do believe he's quite bored.  I think he's quite bored, and he just wants to start banging whatever he can again.  That could be.  I wouldn't know, though.  I don't know too much about that.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Does it get annoying that the one guy in the band is the biggest name?  Does that ever get to be aggravating?  Not at all.  Not a bit, man.  And, you know, it's like, you've got to think about what he's doing to become the biggest  name.  You know what I'm saying?  Do you know you just...  Jimmy Norton just asked the same question that Larry King asked Motley Crue about Tommy 
[03:36:30]  Lee?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Oh, well, I was...  You know, Nick Lachey.  How does it make you feel that he's more popular?  Yeah, did you hear that, Larry?  He did, man.  He sounded kind of like Larry.  That's good.  I like that.  Did you hear Larry King talking to Motley Crue the other day?  It was quite embarrassing there, Jeff.  And what he said, how do you feel like...  What did he say?  He asked the rest of the...  Yeah, he asked the rest of the band.  He asked them, you know, how do...  Hey, does it make you mad that Tommy Lee got more popular after the band broke up? 
[03:37:00]  Well, let me ask you this.  Do you think he really cares?  Those guys really care at this point?  That's pretty much what they said.  The record's made billions of dollars and been with all kinds of chicks.  Yeah, that's pretty much what they said to Larry King.  It's like, Larry, that's a dumb question.  And Norton just asked the same fucking question.  And you know what?  Well, I was only asking because he came in while you were saying the other guy.  That's why I was asking that.  No, we were joking about the other guy thing, Jeff.  And I heard what you were saying.  It depends on what you do to become more famous.  Right.  Because when 98 Degrees was out, Nick wasn't looked at as, wow, the guy. 
[03:37:30]  He became the guy because of the stupid MTV show that I have to watch because it's so stupid.  Hey, she's really hot to look at.  She's really hot, but she's dumb.  Do you ever meet her?  Do you guys really think she's that dumb?  Come on, man.  Again, she's making lots of money and she's a big star.  She can't be...  Yeah, but it's not all about money.  Come on.  You know that.  What's it about?  The chicks?  Getting pussy?  These guys must have done very well. 
[03:38:00]  What was that like, man?  Being in one of those, you know, boy bands?  One of those boy bands?  You know, one of those manufactured pop groups?  Just the girls just throwing themselves at you?  Girls throwing at you?  No, man.  We were real conservative guys.  You know, we never experienced anything like that.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, but it had to be frustrating, too, because a lot of the girls were way underage.  I mean, have you ever been...  Did you ever go to one of our concerts?  No, but I saw news clips where they would show it and show the crowd. 
[03:38:30]  And they would show all teenage young girls at our concert?  Never any older girls, right?  Most of what they would show were just teenage girls.  Why, you had a lot of older girls there, too.  Well, yeah, the mothers that brought the teenage girls.  Were you banging a lot of the mothers, the hot mothers, the milfs?  I refuse to answer that under the ground that may incriminate me.  Yeah, that's true.  Jeff, is this your first solo record?  Yeah, first solo record.  Cool.  Oh, that's a legitimate question by Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm actually...  Of course I'm asking.  You know, it's called Whisper That Way.  Well, thank you, Larry. 
[03:39:00]  Well, I want to ask a real question.  Why not?  Hey, Jeff, how were you discovered?  How was I discovered the group?  How was the group discovered?  We were singing backstage at the Boys the Men concert.  And we actually got discovered by some record reps at Motown, just like Boys the Men got discovered.  You were singing backstage at a concert?  Boys the Men in L.A.  Wow.  Were you invited to sing backstage?  How does that come about?  We sang a cappella to get backstage.  Are you trying to say that if Ant and I go backstage at one of these shows, we could  be the next boy band sensation? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  It depends how good you sing.  Yeah, we'll harmonize together.  But you guys also have to have that androgynous look, too, you know.  No, that ain't going to happen.  Yeah, we're past that stage, I think.  And you also sang at the White House.  How was that?  It was great.  It was really cool.  You know, of course, that's a great experience and honor and stuff like that.  We sang for President Clinton.  We have to say for George Bush, too.  Oh, look at that.  And I bet you Clinton had a lot more fun with you than Bush, right? 
[03:40:00]  He was actually sick that day.  He was really sick.  I bet he was.  I'm sick.  I'm going to have to go.  Yeah, the news broke.  He called it sick.  I'm sick.  My dick is coughing up my stuff.  You guys are cozy.  I had a toll.  I love it.  It's classic.  So he was just sick that day and didn't really get into it, huh?  No, we didn't get to talk to him that much.  I mean, the guy was surrounded by, you know, lots of Secret Service and, you know, all that stuff. 
[03:40:30]  His wife was there, Hillary.  Do you still hang out with any of the guys from the band?  Actually, we just got back together for the first time in a couple years to sing something for their Christmas special.  It was real cool.  It was the first time we'd seen each other all together in three years.  Was that that Nick and Jessica Christmas special?  Yeah, it was.  I like you, man.  I do, because I know you think it's stupid, too.  Yeah, we saw some clips from that show. 
[03:41:00]  At least you left with your dignity, man.  Well, yeah, I mean, we just went on there to sing.  Yeah, that's what you guys do.  Come on, are you really jealous that he's on MTV doing that show?  No, man.  All right, good, good.  In the years I was in the group, we did everything you could possibly do as far as, like, being famous and stuff like that.  Yeah, no, I know.  I don't want to do music for a living.  That's all I care about, you know?  Yeah, the other stuff is, like, you know, peripheral stuff.  So give us the exclusive.  Are they going to break up or not? 
[03:41:30]  I don't know, man.  I don't know much about the relationship, you know?  I try to, you know, I'm not on the reality show.  I kind of steer clear of that whole thing.  Yeah, no.  You know who I like a lot more is Ashley.  Why?  Ashley's great.  Yeah, because she looks like she's a true goer.  She'll give you a little skank in the bedroom.  She'll skank it up a little.  Jessica is not giving you skank in the bedroom, and that's what I'm trying to say here.  Come on.  She's a hot piece of ass, but is she really going to...  Well, she's a good, awesome Christian girl.  Right.  Sure she is. 
[03:42:00]  Get her behind the barn.  Hey, Jeff, are you doing a solo tour?  I'm doing a tour with Jim Brickman right now.  You guys know who he is?  No.  He plays piano.  He's a contemporary artist.  Someone said you...  I'm sorry, go ahead.  Someone said that you were going to be at the downtown on December 23rd in Long Island.  Oh, you did?  Oh, my God.  He's a plug whore.  We have a big celebrity on the phone.  You had to go that way.  I'm asking you if you're going to be performing at the downtown that's December 23rd.  Which one is?  That's when you are performing there.  Jim Norton is a comedian there, Jeff, and he's going to be at the downtown on Long Island 
[03:42:30]  on December 23rd.  It's just like...  I wish I could be in town to check that out.  I might be in town for that one.  Yeah, it's just like selling out arenas, you know?  Except for the arena.  Yeah.  And the thousands of screaming fans.  That's true.  Instead of hot...  Don't forget, they're all young and prepubescent.  I was going to say, instead of hot teenage girls, Norton gets people that might be homosexual.  Guys who crash the Danza message board.  That's all my fan base.  The only thing I sell out is my art.  Jeff, am I hearing in your voice that there were other women that were at these gigs aside 
[03:43:00]  from just prepubescent girls?  Oh, you should have showed up at one.  You might have been surprised.  If I showed up at a 98 Degrees concert, no offense, my friend, my...  Is this Opie or Anthony?  It's Anthony.  Well, if you showed up at a 98 Degrees concert, you might actually get laid.  Yeah, see?  He just got me on that one.  He's right.  Yeah.  No, I would not be getting laid at one of those concerts.  And Jeff, you're married now with two kids, right?  I'm divorced, but I have two kids. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, no!  Oh, you poor bastard.  All right, now you've got something in common with Anthony, except for the two kids thing.  How much money?  How much money what?  Did he get killed?  Of course you get killed.  Oh!  And it was you up on that stage.  It's you singing.  You earning that money.  And then all of a sudden, give me half of it.  Hey, man.  You can always make more money, but you can't always be saved for the rest of your life.  Hey, I've never seen a philosophy.  I've never seen a philosophy.  He had to get out of there. 
[03:44:00]  How did you meet your wife?  I met her in Orange County in California where my parents lived.  At Disneyland?  Yeah, actually, I met her at Disneyland.  She was one of the kids in one of the costumes.  You know, they're not allowed to talk.  They're not allowed to talk, but for some reason, she talked to me, and it was really cool.  Nice.  There you go.  And then where did it go all wrong, Jeff?  Oh, man.  You know how this business is.  I mean, who's divorced?  Anthony?  Yeah.  It's a tough business to be married in.  You know, you're always traveling or, you know, you're always doing something. 
[03:44:30]  You have to be with someone that's really very secure with themselves.  Did she catch you doing anything crazy?  Absolutely not.  I was completely faithful the entire time I was with her.  You were faithful the whole time?  Absolutely.  But she just couldn't take you being away?  Very tough.  You know, very tough, yeah.  Did she get all raggy on you, Jeff?  No, she was a doll.  I love it.  I told you we would like you by the end of this.  Let me ask you a question. 
[03:45:00]  This has got to be frustrating.  As a comic, you don't meet a lot of chicks, but I know singers get laid all the time.  When you'd come home off the road and she'd complain, did you ever just want to grab her  and go, do you have any idea how many girls I could have fucked and didn't?  Who said that?  Me.  Jim Norton.  The comedian.  That's exactly right.  You definitely felt like that, for sure.  Wow, yeah.  You definitely felt like that.  I could be banging all these hot chicks and I'm being faithful and you're giving me shit  about cutting the grass.  He could have opened the front door and showed her the girls that he could be banging, the  ones that just followed him home.  Please.  You know, man, just to keep things sane and normal, I tried to keep her out of the business 
[03:45:30]  as much as possible.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that's so you can look at the hot pieces of the asses that we're walking around.  Why don't you stay home, baby?  You know how that goes.  I don't care if it's a girlfriend or a wife, man.  You just don't look as much when they're walking right next to you.  Oh, baby, the hotels, the buses, I don't want to put you through that.  Yeah.  The signing of the boobs after the show.  There's nothing in it for you.  Oh, man, you're going to kill me right now.  I don't have a private P.O. box where they send the naked pictures. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, that's great, man.  What a life.  That's something.  Now you're branching out.  Got a solo thing happening.  What kind of music is this?  It's more adult contemporary stuff, but it's a lot of harmony-based stuff.  It's sort of like 98 Degrees, a little bit more mature than that, though.  Yeah, you got some guys backing you up?  No, I'm just kind of singing everything myself, wrote and produced it all myself.  What do you do live?  How do you do for the backups? 
[03:46:30]  Well, you know, I haven't toured for the record yet.  I basically have just been on this Christmas tour, which is Christmas music and holiday  music and stuff like that, a couple of my songs once in a while, but I haven't toured  for the record yet.  No lip-syncing when you tour, right?  No, man, I don't lip-sync.  We didn't lip-sync.  Isn't that ridiculous?  We just say I can pedal on a national TV show.  You think we lip-synced on it?  I know.  That's dangerous.  With no musical cues or anything, you could really screw up.  Yeah, that's how we got started.  We were pretty decent at that.  Hey, do you know Ashley at all? 
[03:47:00]  Oh, yeah, of course.  How did you feel watching what happened to her on live television, as somebody who knows  her?  You know what?  Even if I didn't know her, it's embarrassing.  And you know what?  The funny thing is, it was such a big deal for her, and they said she lip-synced or whatever,  but you know how many people lip-sync on that show?  Oh, I know, yeah.  Lip-syncs on every show she's ever on, and everybody knows that.  Britney's ridiculous.  She's dancing badly, like a madwoman.  She's got that stupid headset mic on, and she's dancing around, singing perfectly. 
[03:47:30]  And then the song gets done, and she's like, thank you.  She can't even catch her breath.  She's swinging her head around where no normal human being can sing a song as their neck is  twisting around while you're dancing.  You just can't do it.  Everybody accepts it.  I think they all accept it.  You know, Janet Jackson, the same thing.  Everybody accepts it.  They accept that they're entertainers and not necessarily singers, but they're just kind  of like, okay, well, we know they're not singing.  What kind of dance moves they do?  It's too hot.  Yeah, well, then why not just play a movie of them performing?  You sit in front of that. 
[03:48:00]  Well, does Janet Lip sing, too?  Yeah.  Who?  Janet Jackson.  I don't know.  What do you say?  Dude, did you hear what happened to her at the Super Bowl?  I don't know.  What happened?  I was even too busy having sex with girls.  Wonderful.  All right, Jeff.  You're all right, man.  I told you.  Okay, thanks.  No, I told you we'd all get along.  I had to pass with you guys.  No, you were like, you were not feeling it in the beginning, and I said, don't worry.  We'll bring this all together.  No, I figured you guys would make it all come together for me. 
[03:48:30]  I appreciate it.  Hey, is your CD out now?  Yeah, it just came out.  It's the store's right now.  Yeah, it's called Whisper That Way.  It's Jeff Timmons.  Anything else you want to promote, Jeff?  That's it.  Yeah, I appreciate your time, guys.  Can you call us back again?  Because we don't really get celebrities on the show ever.  I'm sure you don't, yeah.  How do you like XM?  Do you guys like it?  Yeah, because you could say, fuck.  That's the only reason.  That's the only reason we're here.  No, it's great.  The freedom to pretty much say what you want, it's awesome. 
[03:49:00]  Awesome.  Okay, cool.  Congratulations, guys.  Thank you, Jeff.  I appreciate it.  Bye.  Take care.  Take care.  There he goes.  Jeff Timmons, formerly of 98 Degrees.  There you go.  He was a lot of fun.  Nice guy.  You got stars coming in all the time now, Alice.  Wonderful.  Show's getting more gooder.  More gooder.  Why is Lee Abrams here?  Lee's out there.  You want to get him in here?  Wow, really?  He's a legend in the radio business.  Did he fly to Teterboro on his private plane?  Did he fly here from Washington?  With Morgan Freeman? 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, Morgan Freeman got his pilot's license taken away.  One of the big muckety-mucks of XM Satellite Radio is here.  Which one is he?  That guy just brought us donuts.  No, no.  Which one is Lee Abrams?  The guy that looks like Stephen King in the office?  No, that's not him either.  Where's Lee?  He's right there.  Where?  Oh, there's Lee.  Who's Lee?  Does he want to come in and say hi?  Maybe give him some advice or something?  No?  Look at him.  Fuck you guys.  Is that him with the mustache?  I don't like you.  Right there, man. 
[03:50:00]  Wow.  How long has Jack Warden worked at XM?  What a psycho.  This guy's a legend.  This guy's a legend in the business.  He is.  You've got to give respect to Lee Abrams.  Always give respect to Lee Abrams.  Lee, how are you doing?  I'm great.  How are you?  Great.  What are you doing in town?  We're here for a high-level music industry conference.  With an accent on the high.  Yeah.  That's the plan.  Yeah.  Did you fly up here? 
[03:50:30]  No, it's a company policy that I have to take commercial because if I run into an apartment  building, it's an XM liability.  Oh, then XM.  Wow.  How about that?  But on weekends...  You fly around.  Oh, yeah.  Pilot.  What do you think of Morgan Freeman having his pilot's license taken away?  Did you read that?  No, it happened.  He came in and approached at Teterboro, and he didn't inform them that he had intentions  to land there.  What a dumb shit.  You can say dumb shit, right?  Yeah, you can.  We have the XL designation, and we're a premium channel.  That's unbelievable.  Now, of course, you would have to let people at Teterboro know you have intention to land. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, particularly around New York and D.C.  It really helps.  How long have you been flying?  Started in high school back in the late 1800s.  Late 1800s.  Now, when did you go to high school about?  1966.  Barely graduated in 70s.  So you were flying drugs into this country.  Pretty much what any kid that was a pilot back then was doing.  I'm not allowed to discuss that.  Like, why would a kid in the 60s want to become a pilot unless it was to napalm Vietnamese 
[03:51:30]  or fly drugs in?  It was a chick magnet.  Was it?  Oh, are you kidding?  Probably.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, private aircraft was so much safer back then, weren't they?  How did you live through that?  Hey, did you want to work for Pan Am?  Was that like the goal?  Like Pan Am, that was the big airline back then?  Commercial pilot?  Well, I was always into music and flying.  I figured if I was a pilot, I couldn't do the music thing.  Professional pilot.  But if I got into radio, I could do both.  Yeah.  He gave us the best rah-rah speech down at the Washington headquarters.  He gives the best pump-up speech. 
[03:52:00]  He's not the ordinary corporate guy is what it is.  Well, yeah, absolutely.  It's pretty real life.  We're here to revolutionize things.  Change it.  But, I mean, you know, that requires a whole new kind of thinking, and that ain't corporate.  Yeah, it's a totally different thinking than commercial radio, which you were involved in for many years also.  Oh, yeah.  But this is the big one.  Yeah.  Well, this is a lot like I was there when FM sort of came out of the closet from playing Dennis' office music tapes and became mainstream.  And back then, you know, AM was dominant. 
[03:52:30]  You know, it had huge ratings, and FM was just sort of stuck playing back instrumental tapes of orchestral Beatle favorites.  But literally, in about four or five years, the whole thing changed, and FM became dominant.  AM became relegated mainly to sports and talk or just went away.  And I see the same thing now, except the culprit isn't AM, it's FM.  And XM is doing the FM what FM did to AM many years ago.  That requires just massive change.  Obviously, the technology is, you know, incredibly better, but it's also, you know, what happens over the air, the sound. 
[03:53:00]  And just like, you know, 1969, when we were in the drug revolution, sexual revolution, Vietnam, riots on the street, moon landings,  AM radio was like in Leave it to Beaverland doing a very, you know, black and white, crew cut kind of, hey, everything's great, radio.  And meanwhile, there was this whole thing happening on the streets.  FM came in and addressed it then in a 1970 kind of way.  And listeners, you know, they freaked. 
[03:53:30]  They loved it.  And now, you look at FM stations, and they're playing by the 1972 playbook.  You know, ninth caller wins, and there's two for Tuesday, block party weekend, and the lies.  The best music.  That's bullshit.  So what we are doing at XM, you know, across the system, is creating just a sound that is as revolutionary to today's listeners as FM was when it first emerged as a force, you know, 35 years ago.  Yeah, we're the home of rock and roll here, right?  Hey, the home of rock and roll.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  I have a cliche list. 
[03:54:00]  We have a cliche buzzer back in Washington.  Somebody comes up with a cliche, they get buzz, three buzzes, and you're fired.  You know, it's the bragging, the best music, the most, or ninth caller wins is great.  You know, every time, it's like an FCC law that when you give away a prize, it has to be to the ninth caller, which was great in 1970 when the touchtone telephone was invented.  You know, hey, let's do speed dialing because nobody has dial phones anymore.  You know, that was like 35 years.  Isn't there a different way to give away a prize than ninth caller? 
[03:54:30]  And the big voice, you know, that police, very impressive, many years ago when, particularly rock radio, when we were threatened by new wave music and, you know, crew cuts and disco and, you know, rock and roll is all about 180 degrees from that.  And so as a result, the radio station kicked ass.  We rocked.  I mean, stations still do that.  It was like years ago.  We kicked ass.  The disco menace is gone.  If we don't have to worry about it, we won.  So I can go on and on.  No, we like this.  Oh, that's great. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  And the production, he told us, if you guys are doing any production, don't use the lasers.  Oh, yeah.  The Star Wars song, the best music, pew, pew.  I mean, you know, the empire has been defeated back in, I think, 79.  It's over.  It's amazing.  What's really scary is I like to watch TV but turn the picture down and just listen to the commercials.  Car commercials, army commercials, they're so much cooler than what you hear on most FM radio today, you know, as far as the stuff that happens between the songs.  There's a little audio. 
[03:55:30]  It's army commercials are cool.  You know, they're like, it's just.  Don't, don't, don't.  Oh, the Navy, yeah.  Don't, don't, don't.  All that stuff.  And car commercials particularly are just, you know.  Yeah, a lot of car commercials.  Now, it used to be bands were selling out if they sold any of their songs to companies to use in commercials.  And it was years and years after the song came out that they would sell the songs to the company to use.  Now, I mean, there's hit songs that are just coming out that are now, you see them on Cadillac commercials. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  And now it's not selling out anymore.  That's true.  Of course, the whole music business is kind of sick in that sellout way.  But, hey, it's a different, a different conversation.  But, yeah, the production on most stations today, it's radio.  You know, it should be theater of the minds, sonic, taking it to the next level, you know, ethereal, head, heady, cerebral.  And most of it's just pukers, you know, bragging about how great they are and the block party weekend and then Star Wars sound effects.  It's, like, horrible.  But we're going to fix that. 
[03:56:30]  We are.  Lee Abrams.  Hey, thank you very much.  A legend.  Up for a high, uh, high what?  High level.  High level.  Industry meeting.  High level industry meeting.  Hmm.  Yeah.  If he's in town, there's got to be something big going on.  I know.  You're never in New York.  This is the first time we've seen you since we've been here, so.  Well, I will be back.  Invite me.  We'll do part B of the whole thing.  Hell yeah.  See ya.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in Center Reach.  Dave, what did you learn on the show today? 
[03:57:00]  Hey, I learned that open world's going to count the callbacks.  There were seven of them.  And that all niggers should be drowned at birth.  Jimmy's mom's mom.  What?  Don't say that, dude.  G-Baby from upstate New York.  I learned that Connor Peterson's dad taught mommy who's the boss.  Pat from Monaki, New Jersey.  He learned the house next door to me, or him, has been sold to Robin Quivers.  Mike from Jersey.  Today I learned that just like Connor Peterson, funny message board names will never get old.  Never. 
[03:57:30]  Absolutely never.  Jim in Boston.  What's up, Jim?  A couple things.  First off, I learned that Kerry in Jacksonville would fit in perfectly in a Tony Danza audience.  Yes.  Yep.  I learned, I just learned the history of fucking radio from Lee Adams.  Lee Adams.  Whatever the hell his name is.  Lee Adams.  Lee Adams.  And I also learned that if the guy from Panzerfest is right, whoever invented the microphone hates  Jeff the shit dick from 98 Degrees.  Why? 
[03:58:00]  I don't know.  I thought he was getting into the interview.  That's a dog.  See you later.  All right.  He's pretty good.  Should have stopped at two.  Will in Brooklyn.  What's up, Will?  I learned two things.  Uh-oh.  One, I heard American civilization was brought to America by a Chinaman following a shit  trail.  Yeah.  And while on hold, I learned that your interns are scared shitless of your reaction if you  would have went to me and I wasn't there.  Oh, really?  Why?  He actually checked if I was going to hold until you picked up.  Oh, okay.  Well, we're just trying to make sure we have a flow in the show. 
[03:58:30]  Rob.  We'll keep them beaten down in that office.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Yeah, the ticket stop on great this morning, guys.  Oh, cool.  Thanks for helping us out with that.  We really appreciate it.  Thank you.  No problem, guys.  Anytime.  All right.  I learned that Alexander Bell warned Watson that there was a darkie behind him.  Nice.  Got to keep the music down lower than the callers.  Shovelhead, what did you learn on the show today?  Here we go.  I learned that Anthony is a dark Italian and Opie is a blonde hat Nazi.  That's going to be our new name of the show.  Sean from Dallas. 
[03:59:00]  I learned today that girls in Florida can gain 37 pounds in seven minutes.  Yeah, Mark, what's going on?  I learned that age will, age will kill you.  Later.  Later.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, today I learned that Norton likes to Google 10-year-old boys.  And I guess what's in my pants is no fun with 240 shorties. 
[03:59:30]  Very good.  Norton, that is more porn.  Googling.  Norton, that is more porn.  Yeah.  Me up all night, hugging me.  Horn to porn, porn, porn.  Doughboy, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  I learned that Anthony can't tell the difference between a black woman and an Arabic man.  Yes.  Yeah, has anyone else seen that video yet?  There's some great video to check out later today.  Horrid witness.  A store clerk, Jess, blowing someone away, it looks like.  What a racist Anthony is. 
[04:00:00]  Mike in Arizona, what's up?  Mike.  Mike A.  You there, Mike?  All the fast music's playing.  It's not on there.  Mike, Mike, where are you?  Well, I don't know why.  He's a new listener, so he doesn't get the flow of the show.  No, he's a free play convert.  He doesn't need to hear anymore.  He's signing up for the channel, so.  Cut him some slack.  I just want to thank him real fast.  Another guy, free play convert.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, man?  I'm listening to you guys out in Boone, North Carolina.  All right.  All right.

That's his first two-  Big Ten basketball.  It's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Wednesday, December 8, 2004. 
[04:01:30]  I'm Maggie Lenton with the Big Ten today.  After showing no mercy to Wake Forest, handling the Arkansas Razorbacks, and before whipping Chicago State 78-59,  the Fighting Illini found out they were number one on both college basketball polls.  Illinois has held the top rank only two other times in school history, 1952 and 1989, both for one week.  My advice? Stay off the front cover of Sports Illustrated.  The Illini return to action tomorrow night at Georgetown and face Oregon and Chicago on Saturday. 
[04:02:00]  Big Ten!  The Big Ten has three other teams in the top 25.  Iowa moved up to 17th on AP and 24th on the coaches poll.  The Hawkeyes are back in action Friday night against state rival Iowa State.  Michigan State, with losses to Duke and George Washington, dropped to 16th on the coaches and 20th on AP.  They tangle with Stanford on Saturday.  And Wisconsin moved up to 22nd on the coaches poll and 24th on AP.  They traveled to Marquette on Saturday. 
[04:02:30]  Big Ten!  Michigan got a couple of blows to their team with injuries.  The Wolverines will lose swingman Lester Abram for the rest of the season when he has surgery on his left shoulder.  The 6'6 junior was the team's leading scorer last season.  He can apply for redshirt status.  And forward center Graham Brown will be out four to six weeks following hernia surgery on Tuesday.  The 6'9 junior is captain and has played in 70 games starting 59.  Michigan will play South Florida on Saturday. 
[04:03:00]  Big Ten!  Indiana senior point guard Donald Perry has been reinstated on the team.  He had been suspended for violating team rules before the season started.  Perry returned to practice this week.  And that's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  Big Ten!  Big Ten!  You are listening to the O&A Free Play all week long on High Voltage XM 202.
