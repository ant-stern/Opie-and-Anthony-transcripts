<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts gleefully celebrating their improved ratings, boasting about surpassing competitors like Mike and the Mad Dog, Sean Hannity, and K-Rock, using derogatory language to describe their rivals.  They announced comedian Brian Regan as a guest later in the broadcast.  A substantial portion of the show focused on a new client specializing in hair transplants and liposuction, particularly a procedure for removing "bitch boobs," sparking a discussion about a possible listener contest offering this service.  The hosts also recounted a humorous conversation with the client concerning a Chinese doctor performing pubic hair transplants, leading to several misunderstandings about the procedure’s purpose.

The show then delved into the infamous "Blind Boxing" segment, with callers sharing hilarious and painful stories of accidental groin shots and injuries.  Blind Dave, a participant, called in to report serious injuries, including four cracked ribs and a bruised spleen, blaming both the event and subsequent heavy drinking. The hosts mentioned the availability of "Blind Boxing" video clips online.  This transitioned into a discussion about a Columbus, Ohio newspaper article summarizing the show, leading to a heated argument with a syndicator representative over acceptable on-air language, specifically regarding censorship of terms related to oral sex.  The hosts expressed frustration over inconsistent censorship policies.

The show's focus shifted towards FCC regulations and permissible on-air content, with the hosts debating the inconsistencies in enforcement and referencing the Clinton presidency's permissive language. They reviewed segments like "Whip Them Out Wednesdays," "F-U Fridays," a "MILF contest," and the "Stinky Cam."  Brian Regan's in-studio appearance provided a stark contrast to the hosts' often vulgar material, with running jokes about Anthony's annoying laugh and gift-giving habits.  The "Blind Boxing" segment was revisited, mentioning Opie's own groin injury.  Callers shared various anecdotes, including one about seeing "WOW" promotional stickers, another about attending Brian Regan's show, and others about seemingly unrelated topics like lunch and health club experiences.  The show also touched upon a listener applying Preparation H on-air, the hosts’ frequent attendance of Brian Regan's shows, and a planned "teen car wash" segment.  Numerous Stacker 2 and Rockaway Bedding advertisements aired throughout.

A segment featured six 18-year-old women, brought in by producer Jordan, presented as potential participants in a car wash. The hosts joked about Jordan's recruitment method and received a gift: a copy of "American Bukkake," which they explained in vulgar terms.  The women introduced themselves and their ages (all 18), with one highlighted as "the chosen one" due to her piercings. A "look them out Wednesday" segment was mentioned, implying nudity. The conversation meandered through the hosts' previous exploits, including creating a stripper and a business called "the Twottage," leading to the hosts self-proclaiming themselves "teen pimps," which Opie denied. The women briefly cleaned studio equipment and sang "Happy Birthday," before the hosts discussed a "fight club" and provided contact information.  Concerns about coercion were raised.  A brief call from Congressman Gary Condit led to more sexually suggestive jokes. The women discussed their summer jobs, and a discussion about lesbian experiences ensued, with attempts by the hosts to elicit such stories.  The segment concluded with the women's departure, followed by a discussion of their behavior and appearance, culminating in a pungent fart attributed to one of the women and a mocking song. Brian Regan, present throughout, appeared visibly uncomfortable.

Two female guests recounted their past partying experiences, focusing on "Ying and Yang parties" (the nature of which remained unexplained), turtle races (interpreted literally), putt-putt golf, laser light shows, and a visit to a pornographic movie theater.  The conversation involved drinking, marijuana use, and frequent interruptions.  The hosts repeatedly requested photos for their website.  Discussions included past hairstyles and attempts to elicit details about car sex, although the guests denied explicit encounters.  Paul Mercurio from *The Daily Show*, seemingly worn out from the previous segment, appeared as a guest, announcing his Emmy nominations. The hosts and guests engaged in banter about a fart, and the final segment included listener calls sharing humorous observations and sexual innuendo. The show concluded with promotional announcements and further banter about the "Ying Yang party."

Much more gooder than the last time.  Nice.  Nice.  Brian Regan coming in today.  Four o'clock.  Can't effing wait.  Oh, no.  One of our favorite, favorite comedians.  Brian.  You're gonna laugh your yam bags off today, I'm telling you. 
[00:01:30]  Finally getting back to the humor on the Opie and Anthony show.  He's in town in New York tonight?  Yeah.  I don't even know where he's playing.  We'll have to tell everyone.  Did he play last night?  We didn't even promote it.  I don't know.  Because I will go if he's down the road.  Hell yeah.  Oh, Mike and the Mad Dog.  Oops.  Oops.  Beat you again, douchebags.  Poor Mike.  They were all cocky when they were talking about us doing our little TV thing on the XFL. 
[00:02:00]  Mad Dog got a little beat up this past week.  I think he went on vacation.  The listeners just killed him because he was outraged at all the Yankees that got picked for the All-Star game.  Yeah.  And they all performed.  Like, they all performed.  Meanwhile, the couple of guys that they had from the Giants, his favorite team, just like Tank.  Poor Mad Dog. 
[00:02:30]  I can't believe it.  Maggie, we're going to have to get some naked women in on a show.  So he's gone.  I will point out every single time we beat Mike and the Mad Dog, they had nothing but bad things to say about us when we were trying to do that XFL thing.  Well, that's the one point I agree with them.  No, we did fine with that.  But they thought, you know, this is our chance to take a shot at Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  You know.  And they did. 
[00:03:00]  They were number one in this town for many years before we came aboard.  And they haven't been number one in a really long time now.  No.  Ow.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Ouch.  Yeah.  So, thank you.  Sean Hannity from WABC.  Nice try.  You came close.  Nice try, though.  You gave it a good effort.  Dan from Hoboken.  Always current topical.  Too bad Mike Francesca doesn't have wine and cigars to drown his sorrows in. 
[00:03:30]  Nope.  We drank his wine.  Yes, we did.  And smoked his cigars.  Yes, we did.  K-Rock, nice effort.  With your cute little rock and roll show.  Nice effort.  Good enough for, I think, 20th place in the ratings.  Good job.  Ouch.  That's going to leave a bruise.  Oh, ah.  Yeah.  And no, we're not bragging.  These are all people that like trash us on a daily basis. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Toll free 877-692-1027.  We just met with our first client from Philadelphia, Anthony.  Yes, we did.  They brought up a whole team from WYSP in Philadelphia.  Mm-hmm.  Cool guys.  I could see us, like, you know, partying with these people.  Yeah.  And we met a client that takes care of, what, bitch boobs?  He takes care of, does the hair transplants.  Hair transplants.  He looked at both of us in the conference room and went, oh, man, you both have your hair. 
[00:04:30]  He does hair transplants and he does lipo.  Don't let us say the T-wear, though.  Yeah, they won't.  Oh, crap.  Look at me.  I get dumped out of.  But that's what they're called.  I know.  No.  No.  Bitch tees.  Bitch tees.  Bitch boobs.  Bitch boobs.  He's very successful getting rid of the bitch boobs.  So we might have a bitch boob contest.  Really?  For a free procedure.  We'll see.  Oh.  For guys that want to get rid of them.  Oh. 
[00:05:00]  Would the listeners go for that?  Well, yeah.  The guys will have to come down here, though, and get their pictures taken and we'll vote  for the guy that has the worst bitch boobs.  The most horrific set of bitch boobs.  We'll get a procedure to get them removed.  You can take your shirt off at the beach again.  A free procedure.  What is this guy's name?  Is he a doctor officially?  Hell yeah.  He's, like, highly qualified.  Dr. Gregory A. Pistone.  Pistone.  Right?  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:05:30]  Could be Pistone.  Pistone?  Well, you're the Italian.  You're the Pistone.  Pistone?  Pistone?  I don't want to sound like the congressman on The Godfather 2, I believe it was.  Check to Vito Corleone.  Yeah.  You may ask, why are you guys talking about a client from Philadelphia?  Well, we were sitting there, you know, falling asleep like we usually do in the client meetings.  And then we make believe that we care. 
[00:06:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, my God.  If the good doctor's listening, this is what we do.  See, we goof.  We have fun.  It was an entertaining one.  No, it was really funny because then he was telling a story and he's going to get us the doctor so we could interview him on the show.  There's a doctor that does a procedure.  Yeah.  Is it in Asia?  Yeah, it's in China.  In China.  Yeah.  We found out the Chinese women like hairy guys, but Chinese guys, not much hair.  That's what he was telling us.  But the chicks like the hairy guys in China for some reason. 
[00:06:30]  So this doctor in China does pubic transplants.  Pubic hair transplants.  Pubic hair transplants.  Takes hair from the guy's head and transplants it in the pubic area and all around it to get a big, big bird's nest going.  Because the Chinese women, they like that.  And he transplants the hair onto the Chinese guys.  Yeah.  On their chest.  Yeah, and chest hair, too. 
[00:07:00]  Or they take it from the head and put it on their chest.  Look at me.  I am a hairy American man.  Very hairy.  Put on my back.  But you had the line of the day.  Because we're sitting there and, let's face it, Chinese guys, Chinese women, doesn't matter.  They all have straight, flat hair.  Right.  It's the mohair.  Yeah.  Just like mo from The Three Stooges.  Right.  Straight, black hair.  So all I heard was pubic hair transplants.  And Ann turns to the doctor and goes, why?  So they can have curly hair?  That's what I thought.  I thought they were taking pubes and putting it on top of their heads. 
[00:07:30]  So I want the curly hair.  That's disgusting.  I want the curly hair.  Because I figure that, you know, a lot of people have straight hair.  They want curly hair.  You have curly hair.  You want straight hair.  So in China, where they all got straight hair, I thought there was a procedure where you  could get the little, I don't know, the little afro going with pubes.  But no, it's the other way around.  That was so funny.  Put their head hair on their pubes.  They want curly hair?  So we might do something with a good doctor and get someone a free procedure to get rid 
[00:08:00]  of their bitch boobs.  Yeah.  Bitch boobs.  I want to say bitch tees because that's what it's called.  That's what they called it in Fight Club.  Joe, what's going on?  None.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing well.  Good.  Love your show here in Cleveland.  I don't know who that moron is who keeps calling from Cleveland that, you know, the first  week you guys were on, he called like, no, no, no, no, Joe, Joe, let's get out in the 
[00:08:30]  open.  Nothing but love coming from Cleveland.  It's been amazing.  There's always going to be a few people that, you know, they're going to call the show and  hate us.  People in New York that hate us.  Right.  But, I mean, the email we're getting and it's just been unbelievable.  It really has.  I really love the show here.  I've listened to it since it came on.  That first bit you got to do was Clinton in Vietnam.  I was crying in the car on the way home.  Oh, we love that one.  Cool.  I was crying, but that guy getting kicked in the junk today, that was just, that's murder.  I'm hurting myself just driving along here. 
[00:09:00]  Isn't that painful just to listen to?  Yeah.  There were people in the hallway going, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.  I know what you'd call it, like that phantom pain, but I think I'm getting it just from  hearing that.  Joe, that was the highlights of a day that all it was was two guys getting kicked as hard  as they can in the nuts and they enjoyed this.  We had a grandma, I think it's at the end of the tape, that wailed one of the guys.  She was like 75, 77 years old and she kicked one of the guys.  Well, a lot of the women that were in that day, a couple of them were dominatrix, so they 
[00:09:30]  know how to do this and they start kind of slow and see how much pain the guy can tolerate  and they kick kind of, at first they would just kind of kick in it a little lightly with  the tip of their foot and then they'd get a little harder if the guy wanted to.  Well, the granny doesn't know anything about this.  She came in thinking, oh, I just kicked the guy in the yam bag and she wound up and just  slammed him right in the sack.  Yeah.  Little Lou the Toe Groza.  Well, because the interesting thing would go to the guys, you don't mind if ladies come  down here and kick you, right? 
[00:10:00]  And they're like, no.  So we got angry ladies to come down and kick them.  So that was amazing.  For God's sakes.  That was amazing.  All right, Joe.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  Keep it up.  Thanks for the support.  We appreciate that.  You bet.  Take care.  I don't know how guys can do that.  I mean, sometimes you get that little thing that by luck, something will clock you in the  right one.  And you just described what happened to me yesterday during blind boxing.  Oh, he got punched in the sack yesterday during blind boxing.  But it wasn't like a full on because I wouldn't have been able to. 
[00:10:30]  Doesn't need it.  I wouldn't have been able to tell you guys that I got a full shot.  It was more of a half shot, but just enough to get that feeling that you get deep inside  your body.  You don't know where that feeling is coming from.  Like.  Yeah, it's that delayed reaction that you feel.  I got to tell you something about anybody that's done construction knows this one.  And I don't know how it happens every friggin time.  You wind up the extension cord.  You know how you do it?  You're holding your hand and winding around your elbow to get it wound up.  The last piece of the extension cord will always fly out. 
[00:11:00]  So the plug cracks you square in the nuts every single time.  How do it know?  How does it know that?  I don't know.  Every time.  Speaking of blind boxing, a lot of people around here hurting today.  Really?  Because I got punched in the nut.  Rick was scared to fall asleep last night because he took a full shot to the chin.  Oh, he thought he had a conclusion up the brain?  Yeah.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, Yone.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Oh, great.  All right. 
[00:11:30]  First of all, let me just tell you, I am so glad to hear you guys just beat the ass out of all the guys that always talk trash about you.  You know, I always hear them, and I always listen to some music or something late at night, and they're always like, you know, well, you know, our early show is so much better than O&A.  And I just love it that you guys beat them.  Well, you know, we have to be careful, though, because we don't want to come across like we're bragging.  But you've got to understand, these idiots, they trash us on a daily basis, and then the ratings come back, and then they hide, and, you know, they don't talk about it.  I'm not going to say anything about people that haven't said anything about us. 
[00:12:00]  Of course not.  Who cares?  But the people that are your fans know that it's not that you're just, you're not bragging.  You know, you're saying, you know, you guys talk trash about us, and we beat you.  Again.  You know, it's just a defense.  Again.  Just a quick second thing.  Yeah.  The crippled outs you've had the past couple of days have been the funniest damn thing I have ever.  I've had to pull over three times in the past two days.  The pullover guy.  Hey.  Cool.  No, that's cool.  Has anyone seen the video clips of Blind Boxing on FoundryMusic.com? 
[00:12:30]  I'm going to have to punch that up.  It's hilarious.  Thank you, Scott.  Thank you a lot.  All right.  It's hilarious.  You've got to see the clips.  And we have plenty of pictures from Blind Boxing at WNEW.com.  More people were punched like innocent bystanders than I think they laid hands on each other.  And just some of the positions that were going on.  When you see two boxers side by side facing the same direction, kind of moving around and moving their fists with no one in front of them.  They're next to each other. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  But when you see them in single file, like facing the same direction.  Yeah.  One guy was behind the other guy and had no idea.  And they're looking like, all right, I'm waiting.  I'm waiting.  Like he's boxing.  Well, because each round started off slowly because they had to find each other.  So, yeah, they would get in these weird positions.  And finally, there would be some type of contact.  And then all hell would break loose for about 15 seconds.  Well, sometimes the contact wasn't even with the other fighter.  Like Blind Dave, he backed up into his friend that one time, spun around and punched him in the side of the head. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And he didn't stop.  His buddy's going, hey, hey.  He knocked the beer right out of his hand.  George.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  George, you're on the radio.  Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment.  You guys were saying yesterday that, you know, how bad it was that you had blind boxing.  But you guys getting kicked today, God, that's much worse.  Yeah, you think so?  I mean, I don't even know how you can watch that.  It was very painful because by the end of it, they were just kicking away. 
[00:14:00]  And the one guy, we had one guy, he was twisted.  He had, remember the panties he had on?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he was wearing his sister's panties and they had a hole in the back.  A hole cut out in the back.  The guy was from another planet.  Kind of creepy.  All right, George, we're going to have to do that again.  We're going to have to do the nut kicking again.  Tony, what's up?  Tony.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Tony.  That effing bit, man. 
[00:14:30]  People are going to think it was like a funny bit.  I looked at the pictures.  You could see the intensity in their faces.  What, the blind boxing?  Yeah, man, that was sick.  It was really sick.  Dude, did Rick get cracked with an elbow?  Oh, yeah, there's a video of that.  I'm going to check it out like right now.  Man.  Yeah.  Construction story.  You remember the tools?  Certain tools have the automatic cord.  Yeah, the one that you unplugged.  Try getting whapped in the nuts with that, man.  Because the thing will come flying around.  It doesn't go in a straight line.  When it reaches the last, like, four feet or so, it flies around. 
[00:15:00]  You don't know where it's going to go.  It's like, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew.  Right in your sack.  Dude, glancing blow hurts more than a direct shot.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I hope I felt your pain yesterday, man.  Right on, Tony.  Thank you.  Great job, guys.  Keep it up.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Oh, great.  That's good.  Look at the fighting I'm watching here.  Blind boxing.  This is the clip where Rick gets punched in the face with the elbow.  And this is on Foundry Music?  Yeah.  There he is taking a picture.  You see, all right, they're very close to him right now. 
[00:15:30]  And, wow, a lot of punching on the head.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, my God.  Turn it around.  Let me see.  Oh, it's that classic.  You got cracked good?  Oh, he got nailed.  Does he have the video of me getting it in the nut?  Here's Rick.  Watch this elbow blow he gets to his face.  You've got to download this off Foundry.  Oh, my God.  You went down.  You got knocked the f*** out.  I am going to treasure this video. 
[00:16:00]  You know, this is the best.  I got to watch it again.  He's in the corner.  He's trying to push him away, and he's taking pictures.  It gets right next to him, and an elbow just flies right into his face.  Rick, I owe you an apology today.  When you said you got hit, I'm like, no.  Look at, you know, race is great.  Trying to get on the show or something.  You took a sick shot.  Look at that.  That's a sick shot.  Funniest video ever.  I'm telling you, dude, I didn't go to sleep until almost 2 o'clock 
[00:16:30]  because I was afraid to go to sleep.  I thought I had a concussion.  Yeah, we were just talking about that.  That's great.  Steve, a lot of people downloading the blind boxing clips.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I was up until about 1.30 making those.  I wanted to make sure that I got every painful little detail,  including Rick getting knocked down.  So you got a shot of me getting it in the nuts?  Yes, I do.  I'm going to check that one out right now, too.  Wow.  Great job, Steve.  How many clips you got up?  Geez, a dozen easily.  He's got the clip of the two of them standing parallel to each other. 
[00:17:00]  That's great.  Hold on, Steve.  I'm sorry.  I turned you off.  Go.  I got a close-up video of Matt taking both of his eyes out.  Oh.  And, yeah, just great clips, long clips of entire segments of those rounds  where they're parallel with each other and roaming around  until they finally bump into each other and start going at it.  Nice.  It's a really, really cool video.  Go to foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Foundrymusic.com.  Great clips from Blind Boxing.  I think we have an audio clip, Ant, as we go to break. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, and when we get back, this will be fun for the New York audience especially.  We're being syndicated in a lot of cities,  and the newspaper articles are starting to come in.  Yeah.  We have a little article from a Columbus paper.  Oh, we know?  It's funny what they think the show is all about and stuff.  Oh, they don't really have a line on it yet?  Nah, not really.  We'll read it next from, it's called The Other Paper in Columbus, Ohio.  Not only that, a lot of calls coming in now. 
[00:18:00]  I knew this was a serious problem.  The bitch boobs.  A lot of guys now calling up that want to get rid of them.  They do realize they're going to have to, you know, get shots taken,  and the audience is going to, you know, ridicule them pretty good.  Yeah.  We have to have the before shots.  Do you guys want to do the bitch boob?  Yeah.  I think that would be great.  Man move.  Man move.  Well, our new client will give a free procedure.  It's called the bro, Jerry.  You guys want to do it next week? 
[00:18:30]  All right, we'll figure it all out.  Yeah, stay on the line.  We'll get to you.  We'll take a couple of calls from them to see what their pain is all about.  All right, a little audio from blind boxing from yesterday.  All right, ready for blind boxing.  When you guys hear the bell, we'll start.  I can't believe this.  Here we go.  They're facing each other in the corner, and let's get ready to blind rumble.  There they go.  Oh, my God.  They're right in front of each other, and they don't know it.  They have no clue where each other is. 
[00:19:00]  Someone's going to get.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  Here they go.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, hold on.  Oh, my God.  Matt knocked down Dave.  Dave went down hard.  I'm not sure if it was a push.  I'm not sure if it was a push.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Back to neutral corners.  Dave, how are you feeling?  That hurt.  Oh, wow. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, baby.  What did you learn on the show today?  Really not too much, dear.  Not anything useful, anyway.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned absolutely nothing.  I actually lost brain cells.  What did you learn on the show today?  What I learned today, this bit still sucks.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Anthony Stadium Auto Mall.

Catch the best of Opie and Anthony Saturdays, 11 to 3, 1027-WNEW. 
[00:21:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  877-692-1027.  What's wrong in it?  Somebody doesn't get it.  Those guys, I love the show and I don't mean to be a prick,  but according to this ratings thing I'm looking at,  K-Rock kicked your ass.  He's looking at the station ratings.  We don't care about the rest of the station.  We're just talking about from 3 to 7 when it's Opie and Anthony's shift. 
[00:21:30]  K-Rock didn't even come close to us.  Yeah.  So, I mean, they're an embarrassment.  They have a classic rock station in New York beating them.  That's why we get...  You know how embarrassing it is to have a radio station that plays  Leonard Skinner over and over again beating your station  when you're supposed to be playing Stained and all this cool stuff?  Please.  You got a station beating in you that plays Jethro Tull. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, you're looking at an overall station number.  Yeah, K-Rock in New York, they're supposed to be the, you know,  the hip, cool, young rock station.  Right.  They're getting beat by a classic rock station.  Ouch.  They have Howard in the morning.  You take Howard's numbers away and they're a complete embarrassment  to this radio industry.  Complete embarrassment.  There's a station that does two-for-Tuesdays beating them.  Two-for-Tuesdays.  Who the hell is buying the two-for-Tuesday concept still?  Two-fers. 
[00:22:30]  Two-fers.  All day Tuesdays.  All day long.  That's what you're getting beat by the rest of the day when Howard goes off the air.  God.  That does suck, man.  Oof.  Man, I got great hearing.  I just heard a gold record smash against the wall.  You can hear all the way from a couple of blocks down.  Yep.  Hey, I want to say hi to everyone that was at the Stain Show last night. 
[00:23:00]  We had a great time.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Guy's playing acoustic set.  Mark from Philly, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that first, I hate you guys.  I turned on the radio because I drive around all day at my job.  I was like, who are these two goofballs trying to steal a show from the big guy?  You know, but, you know, lately, I'm trying to say, why even call him the big guy?  You know?  Nah, we do our own thing.  You'll learn that eventually.  Yeah.  It takes time, and we understand that. 
[00:23:30]  But I just wanted to say, the sound is so much, it's fresher.  It's so fresh, you know?  You listen to Howard, and you can hear the dust blowing on Robin and all that, man.  Mark, he's still kicking ass.  His ratings were great here in New York.  Great.  Yeah, but he's getting all good.  The rest of the station, though, after Howard goes off the air, is a complete wasteland.  That's what I'm getting at today.  Exactly.  What an embarrassment.  The time is on the show, you know what I'm saying?  You call yourself a PD, you can't even program the station after Howard gets off the air. 
[00:24:00]  And then you take credit for it when the station, you know, looks good in the overall ratings  because you factor in Howard's numbers.  Howard's numbers, absolutely.  But the rest of the day, you're getting beat by a classic rock station.  Hey, it's some deep purple.  They do block party weekends and two for Tuesdays.  People can't get enough of it, Opie.  Can't get enough of the Billy Joel.  Yeah.  You're getting beat by a station that plays Billy Joel. 
[00:24:30]  You want to hear Kansas for the 18 billionth time?  I guess people do.  Wow.  Was that another gold record I just heard hit the wall?  We have a mic over there.  Let's...  Ouch.  A little angry.  You really should never, ever, ever get beat by a classic rock station.  Ever. 
[00:25:00]  Play me some Skynyrd, man.  Classic rock station.  You know, we love the guy, but he has one lung.  You're getting beat by a guy that has one lung.  How does that feel?  The legendary Scott Meeley.  I heard him the other day.  He was playing the U2 song from the Tomb Raider soundtrack there.  Elevation.  Elevation.  And he goes, this is U2 from the Tomb Raider. 
[00:25:30]  Like, he didn't even...  It's like not even from the Tomb Raider movie sound.  He goes, from the Tomb Raider.  From the Tomb Raider.  It was so bad.  Guy's a legend, though.  He was basically on the tarmac when the Beatles landed.  He kicks ass for that hour he's on.  Hell yeah.  Swear to God.  Well, the ratings are showing it.  All right.  Can't even compete with the guy with one lung.  That does a one-hour show.  And half of it is taken up with his Beatle block at the beginning. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  I play three Beatles songs at the beginning of my show.  His one-hour show.  We're done.  He does a one-hour show.  That's it.  An hour.  J.D., what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Anybody check on Blind Dave?  From yesterday's blind boxing?  He was pretty hammered when he left yesterday.  He drank most of the bottle of J.D.?  Yeah.  Hey, Blind Dave...  Go ahead.  Go, go.  You can hear him as the show was progressing, getting drunker and drunker and drunker. 
[00:26:30]  And the man was toasted.  Yeah.  Well, I think that's why he was falling down every round.  But, hey, Blind Dave is checking in, J.D.  You've got great timing.  All right.  Good deal.  Good deal.  Listen, can I send you guys a cleaning bill?  For what?  I got a $1,200 Brooks Brothers suit that I stained yesterday during your teenage fake orgasm.  Good to play.  That was awesome.  Mean girl.  You guys suck.  I'll talk to you later.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to the star of the show yesterday, Blind Dave.  Dave.  What's up, guys?  How you feeling?  Well, I'm going to devote some information. 
[00:27:00]  Only because I'm afraid people might call you and tell you about it.  All right.  I had a job interview kind of thing this morning, and the lady made me go to the hospital.  Why?  I've got four cracked ribs.  Stop it.  I'm dead serious, man.  You do not have...  They just gave me morphine, dude.  Where are you right now?  I just got home.  I got a bruised spleen. 
[00:27:30]  Stop it.  I'm dead serious, because the guy told me if I start feeling sharp abdominal pains, he  goes, come back.  And I said, well, what?  In here?  And he goes, no, call 911.  He goes, because that's your spleen burst, and you'll die.  Oh, come on.  I'm dead frigging serious, dude.  Oh.  So, I got black and blue all over the one part of my ribs, the dude kept getting me.  So, but you guys got a lot of fans at Stanford Hospital in Connecticut there. 
[00:28:00]  You're unbelievable, man.  People were coming up to me going, that's the guy.  That's the guy.  And they were pulling up pictures, the doctor, while they were waiting for x-rays, goes,  I'm looking to see if I can see where he was connecting, if it's where you're bruised.  Oh.  So.  Oh, my God.  So don't feel bad about your guys, your nads and that, but, you know, but if I die, think  of the publicity.  No, no, no, no.  You're not going to die. 
[00:28:30]  No.  No, I hope not, but.  You really have four cracked ribs?  Yeah, and a bruised, they said my kidney's bruised, too.  What?  And they.  That was probably from trying to filter out that much Jack Daniels.  Yeah, and they, yeah, probably next time I come, if I'm ever on the show, I think I'll  stay on the wagon next time.  Oh.  But, um, but, if I croak, I want it on my stone that he may be stupid, but he didn't puss  out.  Oh, no. 
[00:29:00]  You're going to be fine, Dave.  You ain't croaking.  No.  We're going to have you.  I'm just sore as hell, man.  I can't move, man.  You're in a fight.  You know, I got, I got it, I got to give it to the dude, man.  That dude, he got me good, man.  Yeah, that was blind Matt.  But I didn't, you know, if I called it, that would have been, you know, I was like,  nope, I got to go.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Dave, this, this is horrible news today.  Well, you know, hey, man, I still had a good time. 
[00:29:30]  I'll remember it for about a month.  But wait, they gave you a shot of morphine, though?  Well, they were taking blood and then they put saline through the hose and they gave me  morphine through the hose.  I'm a little out of it.  Do they tape up your ribs?  No, they don't do that.  They said.  How'd you drive home if you were on morphine?  I told them I'll drive, I'll drive as careful as I can be, you know.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  But, and then I just heard, I didn't even know I punched my friend in the head. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, you knocked the beer right out of his hand after you hit him in the head.  I told Rick, my elbow don't hurt, man, but I got a big bruise on my forearm.  I think I forearmed him, but I guess you guys could see it.  I can't, you know.  You know, I'm not going to complain about getting, you know, the punch to the nut anymore.  Yeah, and Rick was scared to go to sleep last night because you knocked him the F out practically.  There's a clip on it.  I didn't mean to, you know.  This isn't going to do you any good, Dave, but there's a clip on foundrymusic.com 
[00:30:30]  where you swing your elbow around and you clocked Rick right across the chin.  Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that, you know.  And Rick goes down like that, camera and all, boom.  Oh, man, you know.  No, that's cool.  Well, please, it looks like you got him.  It looks like the dude, my other buddy called me, he said on the thing, he goes,  the dude was crouched.  He goes, the only shot you were going to get, and he said, you used your height against you.  He goes, and the only shot you were going to get was the top of his head.  Right, you didn't even know he was crouched because, well, you're blind, 
[00:31:00]  and you didn't know to go in with maybe an uppercut or something and try to get him in the face.  Yeah, and I didn't know not to drink eight shooters of Jack Daniels and then down most of a bottle.  Yeah, you were drinking like a fish yesterday, man, I got to tell you.  I've been on the wagon a long time, man.  I was, hey, you know.  Right.  But I had a blast.  Look at the influence we have on a blind guy.  He jumps off the wagon.  He's got four broken ribs, a bruised spleen, and a bruised kidney.  Just from hanging out on this show for a day. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, that's what these people in the hospital were like, why did you do this?  And I was like, why did you do this?  I was like, hey, man, I wanted to get on the radio.  Yeah.  Well, you've been on the radio a lot with us.  You're a funny guy.  Thanks.  Hey, man, I'm sorry if I was a little jerky, you know, being an obnoxious drunk there.  No, you were great yesterday.  That was fun.  I had a blast, and you guys were really cool, man.  Could you check in with us on Monday?  I want to make sure everything's all right with you. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  All right.  If I croak, I'll come from the grave and give you my exclusive, the first afterlife interview.  All right.  There'll be no dying.  No, no dying on the O.P. and Anthony show ever.  I hope not, but, you know, I'm just adamant from the friggin' morphine.  All right, man.  We'll call back a little later on.  How's that?  All right, man.  All right.  All right, thanks.  There he goes.  Blind Dave.  Bye.  It's legit.  You just got a call, too, Rick?  Well, I was talking to him off air beforehand, and I was just like, dude, you okay? 
[00:32:30]  Because I tried to reach him earlier.  He wasn't home.  It explains that he was at the hospital.  And he's just like, dude, I just got a nice shot of morphine, and they gave me more to take home.  And then he explained to me everything.  Oh, wow.  Poor guy.  You want to hear another clip from Blind Boxing?  Yeah, let's see.  Maybe this is one of the punches that broke a rib.  Or cracked a rib.  All right.  Are we ready?  Let's resume the round.  Okay, here we go.  All right.  A little over a minute left in the round. 
[00:33:00]  Here they go.  They're looking at each other.  Oh!  Matt connected with...  Dave connected with the right.  Dave is now swinging.  Oh, wow.  All right, they got him.  All right, they're swinging like crazy.  This has got really real.  They're in a clinch now.  All right.  All right, they're out of the ring.  All right, they're out of the ring.  They're out of the ring.  Break, break, break, break, break.  Break, break, break, break, break.  Wait, they're fighting after the bell.  Hold on.  Okay, hold on.  Oh, my God.  These two are out for blood.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rick is down.  Rick got punched in the face. 
[00:33:30]  A lot of people got punched in the face.  Rick got punched in the face.  Time to break him up.  Hold on.  Talk to Dave.  What's he talking about?  Talk to Dave.  Dave, what's going on?  Dave.  I just got body blowed.  My ribs are killing me, man.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You know, I have to admit, when he said that yesterday, I'm like, oh, come on.  You know what I mean?  What?  Like, oh, it couldn't be that bad?  Right.  And now we find out it was that bad.  Because after the fight, he kept saying, dude, I'm not kidding. 
[00:34:00]  My ribs really hurt.  Really hurt.  Well, now he's got four cracked ribs from yesterday's fight.  Well, we asked him, do you want to continue?  He was like, yeah, I'm not pussying out.  And you know what?  No one picked up on the fact that these guys couldn't see.  And let me explain.  We had them fight to a point, and then when someone fell down, we had to break up the fight.  Right.  Because we didn't want anyone to get really, really hurt.  Yeah.  So, to a blind guy, when you're pulling him away from somebody else, you're not sure if  that's the guy you're fighting.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  So, every time we tried to break and we had people trying to separate them, both guys  just assumed that's the other guy.  That they're fighting.  And they started swinging like crazy.  And sometimes kicking.  And kicking and whatever it took.  Dave was on his back.  Throwing elbows.  And he fell down on his back, and people were trying to get him up, and he threw a kick.  And almost clocked Steve.  Right.  Who had the video camera.  Andy, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, listen, I just want to let you guys know, everybody down here in PA near Philly loves Dave,  dude.  Yeah, blind Dave's in. 
[00:35:00]  That guy rules.  Yeah, he's a hero.  You think if he does die, like, imagine five cities at his funeral.  No, man.  You know?  Just stop.  All right, Andy.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  You suck.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Good.  I'm from Philly, but I've been living at Hofstra for the last four years.  I just graduated from there, so I've been listening to you guys for a couple years already.  Oh, cool.  And all my, yeah, thanks.  All my buddies down in Philly already listen to the show like crazy.  I got them all on to you guys.  So they listen to Howard in the morning. 
[00:35:30]  They listen to you guys in the afternoon.  We got nobody listening to the classic rock station down there.  Yeah.  You know, they got block party weekends down there.  They got two for Tuesdays down.  It's a block party weekend, you know?  You should never be beat by a classic rock station.  I don't care what city you're in.  It's an embarrassment.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I did radio at Hofstra on WRH.  Oh, I shouldn't mention the name of the station.  That's all right.  It don't matter.  Well, yeah, all right.  We're not in competition or anything, but, you know, we had a classic rock show there.  And even on the non-commercial station, the classic rock show is the one that doesn't 
[00:36:00]  have any listeners.  Hey, Jeff, is Eric Euler still there?  Uh, no, not that I know of.  He was the guy that was in charge of the station over there.  When I had my band together, we used to go over there and do some interviews for the  five people that listened.  Yeah, right.  It was always a lot of fun.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you always got, like, a couple guys to call in.  Yeah, but everybody down there in Philly is digging the show a lot, guys.  We're glad you're down there.  Right on.  Cool, man.  Thanks, Jeff.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Juice.  Juice!  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Uh-oh.  Yo.  What's up, Juice? 
[00:36:30]  I found the one phrase that isn't sexy with the word teen in front of it.  What?  Teen man boobs.  Teen man boobs.  Teen man boobs.  You know, I think you hit it.  Yes.  You know, we threw this bitch boob thing out there, and it seems like people want to do  the contest.  It seems to me to be a painful thing for a lot of guys.  Dude, it is.  Do you have them, sir?  I have them.  How big are they, would you say?  I could win a wet t-shirt contest.  Really?  And I am a teen.  What's your cup size?  Wait, how old are you?  Sixteen. 
[00:37:00]  You sound like you're, like, 27 years old.  I don't know.  That's just my voice.  How many kids you got?  None.  Ring the bell.  Ring the bell.  Come on.  Inappropriate, bro.  I'm sorry.  Juice, you want in on the contest?  Yeah.  All right.  We got to call the doctor up and see if he'll give away the free procedure.  Will your grandma sign a release?  I think my mother will sign a release.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Why did I assume you lived with your grandma?  You idiot. 
[00:37:30]  No, the moms...  Ring the bell.  Let's go, boys.  The moms are in the picture, usually, eh?  Yeah, my mom.  Okay, your mom's.  Yeah.  And my father lives with me, buddies.  Wow.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And look at us, just assuming you're black.  We're insane.  I am.  I can read those.  And your father lives...  You're like the beaver cleaver house of the black community.  Well, I'm Haitian.  I don't count.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Haitian guy.  You Haitians are scary, man.  We are?  Why?  I don't know.  Haitians, I don't know. 
[00:38:00]  Scary.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to break the bell.  Juice, we're going to have the contest.  Yeah, so stay on the line, okay?  All right.  All right.  There goes Juice.  Poor guy.  He's got the bitch boobs.  That's terrible for a man to have to live with, especially at that young age.  Where's my card?  Do you want to call the guy and see if he'll do the boob contest?  Because we'll start up next week.  That would be good, man.  Here's his number, Rick.  We just talked to him. 
[00:38:30]  There's no cell phone here, but I don't know.  Call his office.  Maybe they'll be able to get a hold of it.  Maybe they could page him or something.  He might even be upstairs still.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah, I'll give away a free procedure.  I'm thinking to myself, he doesn't know who he's talking to because we'll take him up on that in a second.  Of course we will.  Now, Juice brings up a good point.  He's on hold.  He doesn't want his face in the picture.  I think a lot more guys would come forward if their faces weren't in the picture.  This is totally different than any of the contests we do with the ladies, like the best moms you want to ask, best boob contest, best ass, where if your face was in the picture, it was a good thing. 
[00:39:00]  You know what I mean?  Because the guys want to see the whole picture.  But for this, I think it doesn't matter.  I think it's going to be very clinical.  Guys don't care if they're looking at the other guy's face.  I don't think ladies care if the guy's sporting some boobs.  Right.  Carl.  Hey, Carl.  Hey, what's up?  Well.  You got the bitch boobs?  Oh, yeah, man. 
[00:39:30]  God, that's horrible.  I got them.  How bad?  Pretty bad.  Are you a fat guy?  Somewhat.  I mean.  Somewhat.  Because I think the guys that have the best chance of getting the procedure done if they win is a guy that's a little skinnier that has them.  That's, like, awful.  If you're just fat, maybe you could work them off.  I've tried.  It's not working.  Really?  All right.  Well, you could be in on the contest.  It'll be up to the listeners to decide who else is.  Hey, man, I'm coming from Philly.  I'm willing to take a day off and drive all the way up there. 
[00:40:00]  All right, cool.  And I'm bringing beer for present.  Beer!  We love beer.  I'll bring Jaeger.  Oh, we got plenty of Jaeger.  Well, we could always dump the Jaeger into the Jaeger machine.  The Jaeger machine, man.  All right, Carl, hold on.  Okay.  Now they're calling like crazy, so I think we're going to have to do this.  Yeah.  We should start it up next week.  All right.  All right.  Rippling for a man.  So, Anthony, we made the Columbus paper.  Yeah?  I'm hearing reports that this paper is pretty lame, though.  Really?  It's called The Other Paper. 
[00:40:30]  The Other Paper.  All right.  Raunch on the ride home.  What are they talking about, Opie?  Raunch on the ride home.  The picture of us.  Remember when they sent us some...  We love when the new city sent us, like, jerseys and stuff from their city.  Because we wear them like we're sincere.  Yeah, we put them on and take pictures and stuff.  They got a picture of us.  Yeah.  We're in the jerseys from Columbus.  And it says under the picture, at least the jerseys are clean. 
[00:41:00]  Oh!  You got us with that one.  And then it says the Big Wazoo's new shock jocks.  Anthony and Opie.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, this is what they think of our show in Columbus so far.  All right.  Well, this reporter.  Raunch on the ride home.  You're flipping through the FM dial when something gives you pause.  Surely I misheard that, you think?  I couldn't possibly have just heard a gay man.  Yes, you did.  And you certainly didn't hear him then complain about the act, did you? 
[00:41:30]  If you were listening to the Big Wazoo the afternoon of July 4th, you did indeed hear that.  If you've been wondering where all the raunch has gone, wonder no more.  It's gone to the Big Wazoo.  All of it.  Every gooey drop of radio raunch has oozed to the end of the dial during the afternoon drive.  The syndicated Opie and Anthony show has come.  I've poured on breasts.  A wiffle ball bat.  Yep.  That sounds about right.  These are some of the bits we've picked up on so far.  Wow or whip them out Wednesday, women are apparently encouraged to bare their breasts for radio listeners. 
[00:42:00]  That's right.  The wow in the back of your car.  Right out wow in the back of your car.  And the ladies, if they're a fan of the show and feel like it, they will flash you.  And it does happen every single day here in New York.  FU Fridays.  Callers can leave a voicemail message for someone who has irked them.  Don't make us spell it out for you.  The MILF contest.  Yes, it's the moms I'd like to F.  Well, you get the idea. 
[00:42:30]  And then he writes, the Stinky Cam.  It's been offline, so we're not sure about this one.  But Stinky appears to be an actual person.  They don't get...  Yes, Stinky gets a mention.  Stinky makes a compliment, baby.  Stinky.  They probably think that there's a camera on Stinky.  You know what I mean?  You want this for your scrapbook?  Yeah, great.  That's a great line, especially for everyone here in New York.  The Stinky Cam.  It's been offline, so we're not sure about this one. 
[00:43:00]  But Stinky appears to be an actual person.  He's the guy that answers the phones, man.  Nice.  Stinky.  And what's up with the Stinky Cam?  I don't know.  Any update on that?  I know Scott was looking for new software.  We're getting new software for you.  Well, how long is this going to take?  Because a lot of people are disappointed.  We've had a lot of action in here.  We are upgrading the studio with new stuff, so hopefully it'll be included.  I want a timeline on when we can have the big launch of the brand new Stinky Cam,  and we've got to have something good on the camera.  I want something.  I need a date here. 
[00:43:30]  I've got to know when we're going to have it.  I'm throwing my weight around.  You're going to crack.  Oh, look at everyone running around jumping.  Ah!  That's bullshit.  Get a title.  We'll listen.  Yeah, right?  They're dumping out left and right?  No, I don't know.  I already checked.  All right.  I don't know.  What were they dumping out of?  There's nothing here.  They dumped out of the name of the bits in the article.  No, they didn't, right?  No.  No dumps, right? 
[00:44:00]  There's so many people that are saying that.  I guess I don't know what happened there.  Huh?  Maybe it's a different market?  No.  No, I'm looking at...  I'm getting too many of these for it not to have happened or something to have happened.  Uh, Hank.  You know, man, it started getting all choppy while you were reading through, like they  dumped out.  And what part did they dump out of?  You were talking about...  I mean, it was just before the milk contest.  A few Fridays, callers can leave a voicemail message of someone who has irked them. 
[00:44:30]  Don't make us spell it out for you.  Why would they dump out of that?  It wasn't that section.  I'll tell you the truth.  It just started getting all choppy.  It made no sense.  And I went, son of a bitch.  Did they punch out of the oral line?  Yeah, you know what?  I think it was in the oral area.  The oral sex?  You could say that.  Who's on the button today?  Rosen.  Oh.  Rosen?  Keep the cop.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, they dumped out four times. 
[00:45:00]  I think four times out of the whole article.  What?  What did they dump out of?  You couldn't even understand what the hell you were saying.  Oh, my dear sweet Christ.  What the...  They're dumping out of oral sex.  I just figured it out.  Why are they dumping out of oral sex?  You could say oral sex.  As long as you're not descriptive about it.  If you're reading an article in a newspaper, you could pretty much read it verbatim.  Dan from Hoboken said so, too.  So that's definitely...  It's a newspaper article.  All right, pal.  I'll talk to you later.  Thank you.  Now, this whole thing didn't make any sense. 
[00:45:30]  What did they dump out of?  The way you phrased it.  You read it verbatim?  I mean, though it's okay for print, on the air, you can't say it like that.  Say what?  Yes, you can.  Say what?  They're saying, no, you can't.  Say what?  A woman.  You can say that.  You can totally say that.  You can absolutely say that.  I will take them to task on that.  You can say that.  Especially when it's in the paper.  You can say that.  Oh, my... 
[00:46:00]  That just got dumped.  Yeah.  Yeah, that just got dumped.  Why are you talking about that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Because it's too graphic.  According to them, it's too graphic.  Well, you know what?  The last five minutes of our radio show is a complete waste of time because they have decided that we can't say that.  Boy.  That's insane.  You've got to tell us ahead of time, then we won't read the article.  We'll do something else.  Oh, God.  Don't mess with our show.  Don't mess with our show. 
[00:46:30]  Don't mess with our show.  Oh, my God.  You're allowed to say that.  You're allowed to say that.  You're allowed to say that.  I'm going to read it again now.  Oh.  Hey, Rick.  Where's Rick?  Ask them how they want me to phrase that.  I'm totally serious because I want to read this article from Columbus.  I know what they're going to say.  What?  I know what they're going to say. 
[00:47:00]  They're going to say probably the way we worded it when it happened was eat the peach.  Oh, my God.  All right, fine.  I'll try it that way.  And if they dump out, I'm walking down the hall and I'm going to hit someone over the head with a mallet.  What are you, a clown?  It's a Gallagher mallet.  Either that or I'm going to take out that whole wall over there.  That I would believe.  Hey, Anthony, um, there's this paper in Columbus, Ohio called The Other Paper and they wrote an article about us. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yes, Rick.  It's so stupid.  What?  Okay.  You can say it up to a certain point.  You just can't say the word sex.  But you can say the word that starts with O.  Leave.  What?  That is so stupid.  Who's on the button?  And is Jeremy there?  Rosen.  Jeremy's not down there.  That's ridiculous.  Should be able to read this. 
[00:48:00]  That's what he said.  He said he was told you can't say those two words back to back.  Yeah, but not.  You can't say it.  If there's two people in this studio doing it, we would never say it.  But when you're reading an article that includes it, absolutely.  You could totally say that.  This is this guy's impressions of what was going on in this program, regardless of if he was right or wrong about it.  Yeah, this is no record of what went on.  This isn't a transcript of our show. 
[00:48:30]  Jack off.  This is what the guy thought he heard.  Right.  Fact is, we never said oral blank.  What's an oral blank?  Oof.  All right, Anthony.  So I'm going to read this article now.  All right.  The title reads, Raunch on the Ride Home.  If they dump out.  Oh, boy.  You're flipping through the FM dial when something gives you pause. 
[00:49:00]  Surely I misheard that, you think?  I couldn't possibly have just heard a gay man attempting to win NSYNC tickets by performing oral, by performing peach eating on a woman.  Did that work?  You can't say oral peach eating.  Does that work?  Did they dump out, John?  Are we allowed to say peach eating on a woman or does that give it away?  Maybe the peach is just laying on her tummy.  We don't know where the peach is. 
[00:49:30]  Where's the peach?  That's okay?  All right.  Peach.  Peach eating on a woman.  And you certainly didn't hear him then.  I'm so freaking pissed now.  And you certainly didn't hear him then complain about the act, did you?  If you were listening to the Big Wazoo the afternoon of July 4th, you did indeed.  If you've been wondering where all the raunch has gone, wonder no more.  It's gone to the Big Wazoo.  All of it.  Every gooey drop of radio raunch has oozed to the end of the dial during the afternoon drive.  The syndicated Opium Anthony show has come to Columbus. 
[00:50:00]  Let's see.  Breast contest.  Peach eating.  Midgets.  Stuff poured on breasts.  A whiffle ball bat.  Yep, that sounds about right.  That's some of the bits we've picked up on so far.  You got a ruling what?  Got a ruling from Jeremy.  I will completely challenge him on this one.  Because it's not...  Go ahead.  I know what you're going to say already.  He says because it's in print, it comes from a quote-unquote credible source,  as we are not considered a credible source to say that phrase. 
[00:50:30]  This isn't a credible source.  Yes, we are.  It's a little tiny little rag paper in Columbus.  This guy has no credibility whatsoever.  We are not describing an act that is going on right now.  We're not doing...  I don't see how this works.  We are reading an article about...  And he said you can say perform oral, you just can't finish it.  With that...  The word that starts with S.  I got a challenge on this one.  We're going to talk to the lawyers Monday.  Because that is so wrong.  Do you know that was being said on radio and everywhere else 
[00:51:00]  when President Clinton was having it done to him in the White House?  Every effing day you heard that word, the two words put together.  You heard it every single day on radio, on television, everywhere.  Everyone was saying it.  So what's the difference?  Oh, yeah?  I'm allowed to say it.  Well, we'll see. 
[00:51:30]  We'll see if you can say that.  You're allowed to say it.  I've heard it plenty of times.  You are allowed to say that.  And it's in absolutely no context right there when you said it.  You're allowed to say it that way.  Right.  All right.  And moving on.  So those are some of the bits we've picked up on so far.  Oh, they dumped it?  They just dumped it.  They just dumped it.  You can't say that.  You're allowed to say that.  You're allowed to say that.  You just can't describe it. 
[00:52:00]  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  You are allowed to say it.  It depends on what context you're using it in.  There are certain words you can't say.  That is not one of them.  All right.  It goes on to say, wow, we'll whip them out Wednesdays.  Women are apparently encouraged to bare their breasts for radio listeners.  Yes.  You write wow in the back of your car.  And the female fans of the show will whip them out when they see that when they're driving next year on the highway. 
[00:52:30]  The place sucks the energy out of you.  I swear to God.  It's hard enough to try to put on a radio show for a lot of people.  And then you have tools that completely don't understand the rules of broadcasting that will effing screw with you to the point where you're doing stuff on the radio that makes no sense to no one because they dump out of so much crap.  Because every time they dump, we're losing four seconds.  Four seconds is a long time.  F-U Fridays. 
[00:53:00]  Callers can leave a voicemail message for someone who has hurt them.  Don't make us spell it out for you.  The MILF contest.  Yes.  It's the moms I'd like to F.  Well, you get the idea.  The Stinky Cam.  It's been offline, so we're not sure about this one.  But Stinky appears to be an actual person.  Yeah.  All this and more airing about the same time you picked Junior up from daycare.  Oh, please.  That old gag.  But why wait till the drive home to immerse yourself in a 10th grader's fantasy world? 
[00:53:30]  You won't even need to use your imagination.  ONA's website has photos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brian Regan is here, Ant, today.  Thank God.  Somebody that doesn't use any language that would be dumped out of.  The guy's squeaky clean.  Squeaky clean.  Loves everyone.  Doesn't have a bad word to say about anybody. 
[00:54:00]  And you know what I've heard, Ant?  What?  Brian Regan?  Yeah.  What?  You can't say that?  I probably not.  At least not today.  Why not?  I know you could.  I know you could say it.  Here, let's play this last clip from Blind Boxing, and we'll talk to Brian Regan next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't worry.  We'll get the energy right back up.  We have to.  This is our survival. 
[00:54:30]  Blind Boxing.  Let's go.  There they go.  They're back in.  Oh, running in.  Oh!  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  No, no, no.  He's still going.  Okay, they're going to fight their way out of it.  Still going.  They're fighting.  Fighting out of it.  Wow.  Wow.  Break, break.  All right.  Wow.  The...  Break, break, break.  Break, break.  All right, they were out of the ring.  Holy...  Wow.  What a flurry of blows that was. 
[00:55:00]  All right, listen.  I just got punched.  Blind Dave, work in the body.  I just got punched in the nut.  Oh, God.  Opie got punched in the sack.  Opie.  Oh, God damn it.  No!  Oh, no!  Son of a bitch!  No! 
[00:55:30]  Oh, God damn it.  No!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Opie and Anthony.  I'm a mental case.  Yeah.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  Our next guest is a very funny comedian. 
[00:56:00]  Please welcome back to the program, Brian Regan.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  Didn't even hear it.  He didn't have his headphones on.  Now I gotta play it again for him.  Our next guest is a very funny comedian.  Please welcome back to the program, Brian Regan.  Dancers and the comedy music  for the funny guy  coming out in a dance.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  877-692-1027.  In the studio, one of our favorite guests, 
[00:56:30]  one of our favorite comedians, Brian Regan.  Yes.  Thank you.  He was on Letterman recently  and killed once again.  Oh, yeah.  Gotta love Brian Regan.  Everyone does.  And he loves everybody.  I do love everyone.  We were trying to explain to Brian  about Annoying Laugh Anthony.  Do you want to explain that, Ann?  It's the right way.  This guy, Anthony,  that you're seated next to over here,  I don't know what he does  for what limo company.  I don't know.  I guess he's in charge of 
[00:57:00]  Vital Limousine, Anthony.  I do have to give him a plug.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  Thank you.  Because he brought the blind boxers here yesterday.  I appreciate it.  Oh, yes, Brian.  We had blind guys beating each other up yesterday.  Oh, my God.  It was really sad to watch.  I thank God it's radio  so that the people  weren't actually able to see it.  But they have been looking  at the video clips and it's...  Is it like blind golf, you know,  where like a guy will help you  line up a putt?  It was.  There's a guy like line you up  and go, all right,  his nose is right here. 
[00:57:30]  They were pointing them at each other.  Like people were pointing them  and go, okay, go.  Like soccer boppers.  Right.  Soccer boppers.  Soccer boppers are here.  That was the ad.  Like you'd been waiting for them  for three years.  Soccer boppers are here.  They're here.  Where have they been?  So we'd ring the bell for the round.  Uh-huh.  And they would come out  from their corners, 
[00:58:00]  but they obviously can't see each other  and they would walk right by each other.  But they got the boxing stance.  You know how when you're boxing,  you got to kind of  weave back and forth  and throw that jab and stuff?  They were doing that to thin air  while they were standing  back to back with each other.  At one point,  the one guy was facing  the other guy's back.  Yeah, they were walking  in single file down the ring.  Like they're getting ready  to do a feud.  They got to like pace off  and then turn around  and shoot each other.  They're all stealthy though.  It was great.  So yeah,  Knowing Laugh Anthony  brought the boxers 
[00:58:30]  down to the studio yesterday.  So you brought them down?  Yeah.  That's cool.  I actually sent them a van  so they could watch TV  and I forgot that they were blind.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Now he will say stuff  that will come out of left field.  We don't know  where this comes from.  We'll be in the middle  of talking about,  you know,  hey, Brian,  very funny on Letterman.  He will just come out  and say like,  hey, did you see  the blue thing  on the 57th today?  And you'll be like, 
[00:59:00]  what?  What blue thing?  No.  No, there was a blue thing.  And then we look at him  and go,  you jerk,  we're talking about something.  No, don't get mad.  It was a blue thing  that I saw  and I thought  it was blue.  And it takes you  out of the conversation.  Yeah.  And you also notice,  Brian,  that he's the biggest  brown noser you'll ever meet.  Yeah, he is.  He can't come in here  without bringing a gift  every single time.  Look at that.  But it's not done  out of real sincerity.  It's just done  to kiss ass a little bit.  That's not true.  You know that.  Don't do that. 
[00:59:30]  You're the only one  that brings a gift.  Don't you do that.  Don't shoot.  I got no point  just to go.  I got no point  just to go.  You know that's not true.  You have never  showed up here  without bringing something.  Yes, I have.  I've been here before.  You deserve it.  Every time you do well  on the ratings,  we give you some shit.  And notice,  notice,  last time he came in  with Bob's Champagne  and we were all pissed off.  He had like,  hey, try Bob's Champagne.  He's kicked it up a notch. 
[01:00:00]  And now,  because we bitched  and complained,  he brings a bottle of Dom.  So my budget  is getting,  come in here.  We were still drinking  out of paper cups though.  It says Dom  right over Bob's Champagne.  Hey,  let that label peel it.  With a plagic marker.  You misspelled Dom.  What in the world?  I like the defense though.  That's not true.  That's the kind  of defense attorney  you'd want  like if you were ever,  my client,  that's not true.  That's not true. 
[01:00:30]  That's what they say.  I rest my case  because it's not true.  Say something.  You're like that.  You're the defendant.  Say something.  That's not true.  Don't say that.  They're more seasoned  than I am.  I can't talk that well.  Don't you.  Don't.  Don't you say that.  If you can't talk,  then why are you  putting headphones on  and sitting in front  of a microphone?  You know that.  It's a fact.  And you'll notice  anything remotely funny,  he will break out 
[01:01:00]  in a laugh  that is so  completely annoying.  It completely ruins  any funny moment  that just happened.  He has one of those  sitcom laughs.  You know when you're  watching a sitcom  and there's always  that one guy.  The cam laugh  and you hear that whole  like the rumble.  But then in the back  he's the guy,  the tail-off laugh  of the cam laughter.  Big money in that, 
[01:01:30]  being the tail-off laugher.  The tail-off laugher.  You're better than  just the other  cam laugh people.  Making the rounds  of all the audiences  out in the TV tapings.  You know.  The tail-off laugh.  You got a gig, man.  It's cool.  Now where's the cops there,  Am?  I didn't,  no,  I just walked in  with the champagne.  Get the cops.  Go grab some paper cups.  Can't you see  Brian needs a drink?  No, no.  I'm cool, man. 
[01:02:00]  I love that.  I love that.  Come on.  You got to bring me anything?  See, people need to know  Brian Regan,  the nicest guy  you will ever meet  in life,  will never say  anything bad  about anyone.  So we had to explain  to him that  within 10 minutes  you will dislike that guy  but you won't say a word.  Well, so far  everything is cool.  You got a guy  brought in some champagne  and, you know.  Oh, he'll annoy  the hell out of you  and he'll just go like,  he's a colorful character.  He's quite the colorful character.  He's got his own  take on things. 
[01:02:30]  That's all-encompassing,  you know,  with somebody's body.  You can say that  about Charles Manson.  He's got his own  take on things.  Well, why don't you  ask him,  what do you think  of Charles Manson?  Well, you know,  I mean,  the guy was,  he was wrong  in his thinking.  You know?  An independent thinker.  He meant well.  I would say that  what he did  was inappropriate.  But he meant well, right?  He just, 
[01:03:00]  it just came across  the wrong way.  The butcher of Barbie,  well, you know,  as far as butchers go.  He had something to say  but he said it  in a very bad way.  You know.  Attila the Hun.  Well, you know,  as far as Huns go.  Don't lock him out  when he's bringing the cups.  We have to use him  for his champagne at least.  Yeah.  Get him back in the studio.  Let him in  just so he could  pour the champagne.  Marion.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Hi.  Oh, you're not  the retarded Marion, right? 
[01:03:30]  No.  Thank God.  I was just on my way home  and I saw some guy  with wow stickers  plastered on his car.  Yes.  All set to wow him.  Yeah.  I pull up next to him  and he's bopping  to Janet Jackson  or something like that.  He's not even  listening to your show.  Oh, my God.  So I bet you  you decided  not to whip him out.  Oh, hell no.  Good job.  Good job.  Thank you.  I applaud that, Marion.  He doesn't deserve it.  No.  All right, Marion.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  I had to apologize  to Brian Regan again. 
[01:04:00]  We should tell him  why is that?  Well, people need to know  when Brian's around  we all go and see him  because we have a lot  of comedians in here  and we don't see everybody  but with Brian  when he's in the area  even if it's a hassle  we go and see him.  Sure.  Very flattering.  So we've probably  gone to, I don't know,  10 or 12 shows  of Brian's  over the last couple of years.  I happen to be in Boston  a couple months back.  What the hell  are you doing?  He's already starting.  I want to go see him. 
[01:04:30]  Look, see?  This is what he does.  I said I've never seen him.  That's all I said.  I was talking to my son.  But I hope he's talking  onto the listeners  and you're just...  I didn't think he would hear me.  Oh, yes.  You wait.  This is what he does.  He's one of these guys  that doesn't fully understand  that we're trying  to do a radio show  and when we talk  he thinks we're talking to him.  He thinks it's just like  we're in a room  and we're just talking  amongst ourselves  and he can chime in.  It should be like  at one of those  White House press conferences  where Bush is starting to say 
[01:05:00]  you know that's a good idea  I was thinking about the budget.  I think I would learn it  after two and a half years.  What do you got?  Six cups for that bottle of...  You didn't even get  the big magnum bottle.  We're going to have rations  like in the desert  when they only have one canteen.  What the hell?  And why are you  bringing us champagne?  Did you not beat  Mike and the Mad Dog  in the ratings?  We've been beating them  for years now.  That was easy.  Every time your ratings  go up I come in.  What's the problem?  You don't want me in now?  Again?  Don't piss him off  until I get my champagne. 
[01:05:30]  The ratings...  It's the same crap.  Stop.  Don't do that.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nothing else.  That is your clip, my friend.  That's him right there.  Look.  Don't do it.  The big yellow one's the sun, man. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Take one and pass it down, sure.  Oh, gee, I hope I don't get  too tipsy on this.  Woo!  Woo!  Wow.  Look at that.  Party time.  We're doing shots of champagne.  Thanks, Anthony.  It's very cool.  Anthony, you're the guy  that brought the six-pack  of Meisterbrow,  put it in the cooler  and grabbed the Heineken.  Yes.  Now he's doing  like a toast.  To goodness. 
[01:06:30]  There you go.  To goodness.  And all the goodness in it.  He probably doesn't know  what else going on there.  That's great.  So, uh...  It's spreading good cheer  throughout the land.  So, uh...  So, we see Brian all the time.  Sure.  I was away in Boston  hanging out with...  You know Jay?  Sure.  And we're down near Faneuil Hall  and we always check to see,  you know, who's playing  at the Comedy Connection up there.  Lo and behold.  And Brian Regan's playing there.  I'm like, oh, wow, cool. 
[01:07:00]  So, we, you know, we paid  and we went to see him.  And then, uh...  After the show, I said,  well, I'm here.  I might as well say hi.  Sure.  And the look on his face,  like, you are effing stalking me.  And I'm like, hey,  there's somebody here  who wants to say hello.  I'm like, okay, cool, you know.  And then Opie walks back.  I'm like, my gosh.  Just saw you in New York.  Yeah, because it was...  That was great, though, man.  It was like four or five days later  after he was in New York.  Yeah.  So, the first words out of my mouth  is like, Brian,  I swear I'm not stalking you.  I just happened to be a boss 
[01:07:30]  and you were playing  and I just wanted to show you my love  and, you know, check out the show.  But he actually said it like,  hello, Brian.  My name is Opie.  I remember it quite like that.  Did he say he wasn't stalking you  when you found him in your clothes  in your house?  Hey, Brian,  these pants fit me, too.  This is going to sound weird.  You probably think  I'm following you around.  Now, Brian,  I brought the material  for this weekend.  Me and you will go over it.  I brought my date with me. 
[01:08:00]  Brian.  King of comedy.  You ever see  King of Comedy?  Nice.  When De Niro  takes his girlfriend  over to Jerry Lewis' house there.  I love that.  Jerry,  I got the work here  that you promised  we would work on.  The material.  Jerry.  Oh, look.  Look at him pulling a gag now  saying we're not supposed  to be here.  Jerry.  Get out of my house.  I like the cue cards  that he was holding up  for Jerry to read.  I have a gun.  He's got to like, 
[01:08:30]  you know,  move them along.  Point it at my head.  It's upside down.  It's upside down.  Turn it.  You skipped one.  You skipped one.  Didn't I give you  my best of Jerry albums?  My spot in line.  My spot.  I gave you my spot.  What a great,  sick movie that is.  King of Comedy.  And the Asian guy,  the butler or whatever.  I'm having a heart attack  already.  Mr. Langford not here.  Mr. Langford not here.  Mr. Langford,  he's here.  He won't leave.  I'm having a heart attack now. 
[01:09:00]  Lexi wants in.  Hey, Lexi,  what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Listen,  I was arguing with Stinky  on the other line there.  Yeah.  We came all the way down.  When I was in Boston  visiting some friends at MIT,  I had them hooked  on Brian Regan,  like downloading  all that crap  off the internet.  And when they came up  to New York,  we went to see him  at Caroline's.  Oh, great.  I had to sit on the hump  all the way there, Brian.  I should be able to come up  and say hi to you today.  I swear to God.  There you go.  On the hump  and the back seat.  Yes,  I was forced to.  Well,  where are you?  I'm in Westchester. 
[01:09:30]  Well,  Brian,  I don't know  how long Brian's  going to be here.  Well,  I mean,  Brian,  you should stay  until I get there.  It takes about 35 minutes.  I'll wait as long  as I can.  I'll wait.  I don't care.  I'll miss my show.  We have a little thing  of champagne here for you.  Well,  what time do you have to leave?  I'm not sure,  but I've got two shows  tonight out in New Jersey.  If you want to see Brian,  I should tell the folks,  Bananas and Hasbrok Heights,  two shows tonight,  two shows tomorrow.  These shows sell out  like really fast,  so you're going to want 
[01:10:00]  to call ahead for tickets.  201-727-1090.  We have that number here.  It's Bananas,  Hasbrok Heights,  tonight and tomorrow,  two shows.  It's the hump thing.  I had to sit on the hump.  I am on my way  and I am not sitting  on the hump this time.  All right,  come on down.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  I think I know  what she's talking about.  What's that?  You're like the Antichrist,  the Otto and George, right?  You don't curse  and do anything like that.  Oh, my God.  See what he says?  I said,  I said heck 
[01:10:30]  in a show  about three weeks ago  and, you know,  what the heck,  stirred things up, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Things got out of hand.  Somebody picked up a chair.  It started a big brawl.  Who are you saying heck to?  No, I, you know,  I work,  I work pretty clean,  I guess.  You were talking about,  I want to hear your take on the,  you were talking about the hump.  Oh, well,  I think she's talking about,  I used to sit on that  when I was a kid  because you got  the three older brothers.  The whole family,  you have to call the seat.  Right.  You call the seat  when you get in your car 
[01:11:00]  as a kid.  You're going out on vacation,  you know,  and you get the shotgun,  you know.  That's front seat, sure.  Shotgun,  but I had the three older brothers.  I knew where I was going to sit  so I would just pretend  like I wanted it,  you know.  I was like,  back seat,  back seat in the middle  with my feet on the hump.  I call it,  I get the hump.  My parents were like,  he's calling the hump,  Walt.  He shouldn't want the hump  as long as they ain't fighting.  Hump's good,  right, Brian?  Oh, the hump's good.  You like the hump.  I love the hump. 
[01:11:30]  I'm the hump boy.  I'm riding the hump  to Disney World.  I don't know why  you call anything anyway,  you know.  My first day in school,  I thought you're supposed  to like call things  like all the time,  you know.  And my first day in school,  I was like,  I call this desk.  The teacher's like,  yes,  we all do, Brian.  I'm like grabbing onto it,  looking around like  somebody's going to  take it from me.  I call this desk.  Yes,  we call it desk too. 
[01:12:00]  I call it,  I call it desk.  I call this desk.  It's very good.  Hey,  we're just getting started  with Brian Regan.  Playing tonight  and tomorrow,  Bananas,  Hasbrook Heights.  I'm telling you,  you'll have a great time.  Two shows tonight,  8 and 1045,  yes?  You're like simulcast,  you're getting all over  the road.  Oh, yes, 
[01:12:30]  we are.  It's spreading.  Do you have to like  be vague with the times  and everything now?  Do you got to do the  half past the hour?  Half past the hour.  Yeah,  we got to do that.  Well,  know why the show works  in other cities?  Because we never did time,  never did weather,  never did traffic,  never did news.  We just,  we don't care.  Because no one cares.  It's 10 after something  and there's some traffic  out there.  Right.  All right.  In your city.  Now for the forecast  in your city. 
[01:13:00]  And they got to go away  to the local guy.  No,  we don't have to do that.  People have watches  and so they know the time.  I never got that anyway.  Yeah.  They got to tell you  the time on the radio for it.  You know,  you're driving around  for eight minutes  going,  I wonder what time it is.  Why won't these disc jockeys  tell me what time it is?  I got to get to work  and they're just talking  about everything  but the time.  I might be late  and I need to know  the temperature.  I mean, 
[01:13:30]  I know I got from my house  into the car  so I probably have  a rough idea.  I need to know exactly.  And I want to know  the traffic  even though I'm sitting in it.  Why do they do all that?  I don't know.  We try not to.  Because they have nothing  else to talk about.  That's why.  Mike.  Yeah,  what's up?  Hey.  Brian,  what's going on?  Hey,  Mike,  how are you,  man?  All right,  I was just sitting down  watching TV  and there was  a monster truck race on.  I don't know.  I know that's like  one of your favorite things. 
[01:14:00]  Man.  You know,  as a matter of fact.  Hey,  Brian,  take luck,  man.  Take luck and care.  You got the best listeners,  man.  I remember saying  the great set-up set-ups  are like smooth as silk.  There's a monster truck show,  Brian.  Go.  Well,  I know what it is.  They were sick of me  doing the awkward set-up.  Yeah.  They're like,  screw that.  We'll do it ourselves.  Well,  you've seen them,  right?  The TV monster trucks.  Oh,  yeah.  The favorite,  the best part is 
[01:14:30]  when they interview them.  They interview them  when the whole race  or whatever they're doing.  I don't know if it's a race  or an activity.  I don't know what  they're trying to accomplish.  But when they're done,  they interview the guys  and they always talk  about their engine,  like you know  what they're talking about.  Hey,  what were you thinking  during that last run,  Earl?  Well,  you know,  I was going pretty good  and about halfway  through the flap  coil valve burner  started smoking.  The hydro pin spring  was spurting oil  out the manifold draft.  I knew if I didn't  overflow the gasket,  I'm going to have  that last pot  on the unplugged  transmission valve.  I knew if I couldn't do that,  I was going to have to  shut her down. 
[01:15:00]  You know,  you're at home.  What?  Wait,  the flap coil burner?  Well,  sure,  you had to shut her.  What options  did you have?  Your hydro plate spring  was spurting  transmission oil.  You had to shut her down.  She's like an idiot.  Why don't we take a break?  Brian Regan in studio  and we couldn't be happier.

[01:17:00]  playing Bananas  in Hasbro Heights  tonight and tomorrow,  two shows.  Highly recommend  you see Brian Regan.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Brian,  you into the drowning pool?  Sure.  Who can't enjoy  a little drowning  every now and then?  The band,  Drowning Pool.  Oh, that's the band.  I thought you,  you guys do such weird stuff,  I thought maybe you had  a pool out in the lobby.  We're drowning people.  You know,  you got blind guys boxing.  We're going to drown 
[01:17:30]  some people  out in our drowning pool.  Sure,  let's try to make it funny.  You have been here  for some real sick stuff, man.  You know,  I've been here  for the rat cooking  and the hemorrhoid touching  that we're going to head out  and start drowning  some people  in the little kiddie pool.  You were here  for that other thing  that Ron and Fez  were doing.  Oh,  he stayed late  when Ron and Fez  were on at night.  The enema guy.  Yeah,  that was...  and the enema guy.  Oh,  that was sick. 
[01:18:00]  And he was bleeding  because what were they doing  to him?  Whipping him or something?  He started bleeding.  Well,  they had the dominatrix  women coming in.  The one that Opie  offended.  Yeah.  And made cry.  Opie made a dominatrix  cry and run away.  Is that like a rat?  A woman that like  just gets off  on beating up men.  Opie said  she looked like  Joey Ramone  and she was in tears  running off the shelf.  She was like,  wait a second.  Wait just a second here.  I'm trying to be 
[01:18:30]  a professional  and then you say that?  I mean...  Dominatrix,  for God's sake.  I'm supposed to dominate.  Not you.  I got no place  I can go.  No,  you're Joey Ramone.  A lot of weird questions  coming in for Brian.  I don't really get it.  People thinking  he's in authority  on something.  Brian,  help me out.  This comes from Scott.  Brian,  help me out.  Hold on.  What?  I'm leaving.  Why did you have to tell us?  You've got to announce  in the middle of... 
[01:19:00]  No.  Oh, my God.  Why did...  You have to tell  everyone you're leaving.  We're setting something up  right in the middle of it  and he just says it.  I'll be leaving now.  I'm departing.  You know,  the weird thing is  we didn't even notice  you were there  until you opened your mouth.  I know that.  I thought I was right.  So you're not leaving.  I have to.  He says he's leaving  and he gets on a chair  and pulls up  and puts his headphones on.  I'm not that familiar  with the whole leaving concept, 
[01:19:30]  but I was always  under the impression  that meant  you're going somewhere else.  I'm leaving.  Hey, all right.  Where's my headphones?  Let me pull up a chair.  All right.  I've left.  I've got to stay soon.  What are you doing, Anthony?  You're not feeling loved  or something?  You want to ask  Brian Regan something?  Do you have tickets for me?  Yeah, man.  I'll take care of you.  Cool.  Sure.  You and your wife?  Sure.  Wife, girlfriend, girlfriend.  Girlfriend, okay.  I've got 20 more people.  Yeah, about 10,  five more tickets,  six more tickets.  Good. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Anthony was in the middle  of something.  All right.  I'm sorry.  He told me to stay.  I thought it was off.  No, and you don't leave  while Brian is ready  to be funny.  That's all right, man.  You know, I mean,  look at Brian.  That's all right.  Everybody's sharing  in the thing.  Brian needs complete cooperation  when he's going to be funny.  I would love to know, Brian,  when there's no way I can...  Brian is about to be funny.  Everyone focus.  Everyone focus  on how funny  Brian is going to be 
[01:20:30]  in T-minus 10 seconds.  Nine, eight.  Buckle up, everyone.  Brian's going to be  very funny.  Five, four, three.  Oh, my gosh.  This is going to be funny.  Humor sequence initiated.  Two, one.  All right.  I would love to know  what's going on  in Brian's head, though,  when he goes,  no, it's okay.  He's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  This son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  And I was saying,  I'm leaving.  Never mind.  He made me stay.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, what were you saying? 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Anthony, let's see  if we can't just,  I don't know,  be quiet for the segment.  There we go.  All right.  I saw a blue thing  on 57th.  It was blue.  You want to talk about that?  I've never seen  anything so blue.  I'm driving along,  you know,  and we're at 55th,  we're at 56th.  I'm like,  I haven't seen a blue thing yet.  We come on 57th,  57th.  My God,  there's a blue thing right there.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  I think the people  tuning in late  going,  what the hell's  the blue thing?  I don't know.  Scott's asking,  I don't know why,  but I'm about to leave work.  I need to eat,  and I have a Pop-Tart  sitting here  and can't figure out  how to cook it.  I know you know  a little something about it.  Can you help me, Scott?  You know,  as a matter of fact, Scott,  you know,  I do know a little bit  about that  because I was looking  at a Pop-Tarts box recently,  and what you have to do,  you have to look  at the directions.  They have directions  on there for you,  which is very helpful, 
[01:22:00]  you know,  because, you know,  if they weren't on there,  you'd take the box,  you'd just set it down,  and you'd just be like,  huh,  how do I get  that goodness in me?  Where do you go?  How do you begin?  Well,  you look at the directions.  They have two sets.  They've got the toaster directions,  which are longer  than one step.  That's what kills me.  There's more than one step  for toaster directions.  You'd think at most  there would be one step  that was like,  toast the Pop-Tarts. 
[01:22:30]  Go ahead,  toast them.  Hey,  are you still reading this?  But,  you know,  you've got the box.  Look at the box.  They've broken them down  into smaller increments.  These are some  of the actual steps.  Step one,  number one,  remove pastry  from pouch.  Oh.  All right,  let me get them  out of the pouch.  Okay,  I see where they're  going with this.  We're banging  on all cylinders now. 
[01:23:00]  We got them  out of the pouch.  Number two,  insert pastry  vertically.  Oh.  And your brain explodes.  You know,  you're reading  toaster directions.  You're going to understand  the vertical concept.  But if you don't  have time for that,  they've got the  microwave direction,  Scott,  that you can  microwave,  and I swear  on the box  it says,  microwave on high  for three seconds.  Three.  I don't think  I want to wake up 
[01:23:30]  and be eaten  in three seconds,  you know.  Your alarm goes off,  your head pops off  your pillow,  you put them in,  ding,  you take a bite,  I gotta get out of here.  If you're waking,  eating,  and hauling  in three seconds,  you're booking  yourself too tight.  I don't know if that helped.  I don't know if that  helped you, Scott.  I hope that helped out.  It's interesting  you would have  a question right there.  I know.  Out of nowhere.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, ONA?  Congratulations on the ratings.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, sir.  We were more gooder 
[01:24:00]  this time around.  A lot more gooder.  A lot more gooder.  Brian, two things.  Yes.  One, I just had pizza.  Again, the people  calling to tell us  what they ate  for no apparent reason  whatsoever.  And Brian,  I just joined  the health club  and I was wondering  if you ever  joined the health club.  You don't.  Okay.  It's funny  you would ask that  because,  no, of course,  you know,  everybody joins them.  But they always  have the intimidating guy.  They always have  the big guy,  the big giant guy  showing you around.  You know,  you walk in there, 
[01:24:30]  you got to hold his hand.  He's like nine feet above you.  Where are we headed,  Thunder?  Why do they give you  a clipboard  for your first day  at the health club?  You're walking around  with a clipboard.  Can you feel like  more of a goofball?  I'm new.  I'm supposed  to check things  as I see them.  I'm standing out  like a sore thumb.  Sure,  you got to follow  the, 
[01:25:00]  you know,  I always got to follow  the guy who can move  the entire rack  of plates.  The guy moves  the entire rack  and then I got to go up  and move two plates.  Clank!  Clank!  Clank!  I'm the two plate guy.  Clank!  Who wants to spot me?  Clank!  You know,  you're walking out,  you got to reach  way down to get the pin.  People know what you're doing.  They,  they see you got your hand  on the seat 
[01:25:30]  and you're,  all they can see  is your back  because your,  your knuckles  are dragging  against the floor  trying to grab  the pin out  from the bottom  and then you got to  ask somebody  for a footstool  to put it up  where you need it.  Can somebody  give me a boost?  I got to put the pin  up near the ceiling  because the big guy  had it a little lower  than what I can handle.  Oh my God. 
[01:26:00]  Bravo.  People just feel like  asking you questions,  I guess.  That's all.  And from all over,  all over the map.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're an expert  on everything,  I think.  That's what it is.  Hey,  you know what I want  to show up,  Brian?  What's that?  He was here  for the original  Sandy Cain appearance.  Yes,  I was here in the studio.  One of the listeners  touching her hemorrhoid  over and over again.  Right.  You remember,  right, Brian?  Of course.  You remember that one?  How does that go  out of your memory bank?  If you don't remember,  maybe I could play  a couple of sounds  that will refresh 
[01:26:30]  your memory, Brian.  They're embedded  in my memory soundtrack,  but sure,  let's listen.  She came in,  she had her hemorrhoid.  We had a listener  come in  and apply preparation H  to her.  Yeah,  you saw the whole thing.  And if you remember,  the first application,  she was in mid-sentence.  Mid-sentence.  And she said this.  I don't believe it.  I think she was saying,  I don't believe  I'm doing this. 
[01:27:00]  And you could tell  right at the point  of contact  of preparation H  to hemorrhoid  when she said,  I don't believe.  I don't believe it.  A sound only,  somebody can only make  when somebody  applies preparation H  by complete surprise.  I don't believe it.  You know,  if you hired  a voiceover person  to try to nail that,  it would take them  a thousand takes  and they wouldn't be able  to duplicate this.  I don't believe it.  Now,  the second time  he applied it  because it was so much fun  the first time,  we told him now, 
[01:27:30]  really,  really apply it.  Hard.  And she made this sound.  Oh!  Plain,  simple,  straight to the point.  Oh!  Oh, man.  Oh!  Now,  by the third time,  we're all laughing.  We tell him,  maybe he can't cover  enough area  with just one digit.  So we told him  to take the middle finger  and the index,  the pointer finger,  and apply  thoroughly.  And to that, 
[01:28:00]  she just made this sound.  Ow!  Ow!  So you could see  the gradual  I don't believe it.  Oh!  Ow!  Progression of the  application of preparation.  So the question  I have for Brian,  is it safe to say  that was the grossest  thing you've ever seen?  Or close to it?  That was definitely  a top tenner.  Okay.  She does comedy  and magic?  Is that...  Oh!  The magic  is the fact  that she's still breathing.  Right.  Comedy? 
[01:28:30]  Mmm.  Just trying to give her  a little plug.  We didn't think  there was anything  grosser on her body.  Yeah.  She came back,  Brian,  and we want to show you  a picture of what  she showed us.  Okay.  This is...  I'm turning it away  for a minute.  This picture you're  about to see  is a growth  that is on  Sandy Cain's  thatch  or patch.  I think you know  the area in question.  Mm-hmm.  And she just  pulled this out  of nowhere.  She goes,  yeah,  I had this thing  going on  and now I have 
[01:29:00]  this growth.  So we took  a picture of it  and put it up  on the website  because everyone  should share  in the misery.  And we want you to...  Oh, God,  I just looked at it.  Well, let's see  the reaction.  We want you to  take a look at this  and show us  what you think.  I don't believe!  I don't...  Wow.  And then above  you've got the ad  Lose Weight Fast.  Yeah,  you see that?  I don't know.  It looks like...  We said it looked 
[01:29:30]  like the ear.  I'm getting...  No, I was just  looking at it.  Let me get it off.  What...  What area?  It was right there.  That's right there.  Right above  and to the left  of Ground Zero.  Yeah.  And it's like  a half a ear, Brian.  It looks like...  Did you see  that little mouse  that they grew  the human ear on  for transplanting?  Yes.  It looks like that  except with a more  cauliflower texture  to it.  Oh!  Nice, right?  So how do you like  to get your first 
[01:30:00]  ear implant?  And then they  got to go,  um,  you might want  to sit down.  We want to  tell you a little bit  about the origins  of this ear.  Where this came from.  You know,  there are certain areas  where it's easier  to grow an ear.  Did you know?  Take a look  at this.  Andrea.  Hey, Oak.  And everyone,  what's up?  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  Hey, you never  sent me my, uh,  autograph,  you promise?  Huh?  From when I met you 
[01:30:30]  last time  at the Brian Regan show.  Brian Regan show.  I was supposed  to send you an autograph?  Yeah, remember me?  White pants,  purple shirt.  Oh, yeah.  I lost your autograph  and you were going  to send me one  from you in, uh...  In it?  Uh-huh.  Oh, I forgot.  But since then,  I wanted to ask  Brian Regan something.  Okay.  I got bifocals.  You did?  Yes.  And I wanted to know  if he's ever had  any experience  with bifocals.  Well, you know,  they actually have  trifocals now.  Really?  My eye doctor, 
[01:31:00]  I swear,  he asked me  if I wanted  to try trifocals  and I was like,  I must have been  away a while.  And I said,  I don't know  what you're talking about.  He goes,  well, it's what  you would think.  You know,  you could see it  three different distances  depending on where  you look through the lens.  You can see close  or medium  or far away  and I'm like,  you know,  I can't even imagine  getting used to that.  You know,  there's a book,  there's a plane,  there's Alpha Centauri!  Do people need  this kind of range,  you know?  Is that a fly in my nose?  Is that a comet? 
[01:31:30]  Hey,  do you need to see  everything?  I believe that's  an amoeba.  Andromeda strain!  I don't know  if Andromeda strain  is a galaxy,  but it sure  sounds like one.  It sure does.  He's kind of  winging the last one.  Who knew?  Or somebody  doesn't call in,  wait a second,  there's no such  interplanetary  place called  Andromeda strain.  What kind of joke  is that,  clown? 
[01:32:00]  If you're going  to be talking  about galaxies,  nail them down,  ho-ho.  Andromeda strain,  I'm sitting here  all disappointed  in your humor  because I like  small things  and big things.  Paramecium,  yeah,  that's right.  Andromeda strain?  Do some research,  clown.  Hey,  John,  what's up?  Hey,  I just wanted  to ask Brian  what happened  to him  the last time  he went  to Dunkin' Donuts.  Boy,  you people 
[01:32:30]  are subtle.  Nice.  Nice.  He's been  giving himself  a nice idea.  Well,  Brian went  and got a  cup of coffee  and that's,  yeah.  Yeah,  they had,  have you been  there?  They got good  coffee.  Yeah,  I like it too.  Yeah,  it was good.  I just sat  there and was  like,  man.  Did you try  the cool  lot of stuff?  Yeah,  that's good.  That's good.  And I got,  they had like  some napkins  there so I  like,  you know,  wipe my mouth  off.  Very convenient.  It's a jelly  or jam  on your lip,  yes.  This is good.  This is great.  Now they got, 
[01:33:00]  the donut  choices.  They're out of  control.  I feel bad  for the ladies  in there,  the donut  ladies.  I don't know  what they're  getting paid,  but you know,  you've got these  people coming in  there who can't  make up their  mind.  Okay.  Okay,  I want a dozen  donuts and  you got a lot  of donuts.  Okay,  I'm going to  start with  four chocolate.  I want two  twisty goose.  I want a 
[01:33:30]  lemon twirler.  I want a  honey.  a honey buff.  No,  I want two  strawberry twiffs.  No,  three razz crunches.  Two.  Put them,  I want,  put them back.  I want a  Bavarian apple  crunch.  Get the latter.  Hey,  hey,  why don't you  go out inside  and think it  over,  huh?  It's a big  decision.  Can't blow  donut day.  But the donut  ladies,  they've gotten  together,  you know,  they know how  to get back  at you.  They do the  subtraction for  you in front  of all the 
[01:34:00]  other customers  and make you  look dumb.  You're going  there.  Yeah,  I'd like a  dozen donuts.  I'll start  with seven  chocolate.  You have  five left.  Okay.  Okay,  if I order  one more,  then how many  would I have  left?  How many  would I have  then,  donut lady?  that's what I  need to know  and now?  I don't know  how she does  it,  man.  I think she's  palming a  clicker.  She's cupping 
[01:34:30]  something.  She's palming a  clicker.  I know it.  Brian Regan  playing Bananas  in Hasbrook  Heights tonight  and tomorrow.  Two shows  both nights.  I'm telling you,  you're going to  have a great  time.  Oh,  yeah.  You guys  are in  Columbus,  Ohio,  too,  right?  Yeah.  That's a big  wazoo.  What?  The radio  station's called  The Big  Wazoo.  Oh,  well,  cool,  man.  Because I'm  there next  week,  I think,  at the  Funny Bone.  Funny Bone?  Yeah,  Columbus,  Ohio.  Cool.  Traveling a  lot.  Yeah,  the life of  a comic.  Out and 
[01:35:00]  about.  We have to  take a break.  We have  ten teens  outside the  studio.  What?  Ten teens?  Even Brian's  head went  burm.  I thought it  was like a  number.  Thirteen,  fourteen,  ten teens.  Ten teens.  Eleven teen,  twelve teens.  We have  ten teen  people.  We have  six or  seventeen.  Sorry.  We have  seventeen or  sixteen?  Seven teens.  We have  teenage girls  outside the  studio,  Brian.  Okay.  Buckle in.  How do you  argue with that?  Buckle in.  Buckle in.  877-692-1027.

Tonight and tomorrow night.  Not many tickets available,  so give them a call.  201-727-1090.  Annoying laugh.  Anthony's on the phone.  I didn't even know he left the studio.  Yeah,  he announced that he was leaving. 
[01:37:30]  But then he stayed.  And now he's gone.  Can I ever walk out of there  with my head held high  with you guys?  No.  You hate me.  Why?  What do you want, Anthony?  Nothing,  I just...  It says on the screen  you want a plug.  What,  you want a free procedure?  Yes.  Yes,  I'll do it.  You want free hair?  Yeah.  You go for the free hair thing?  We'll do it.  Just one.  He just wants one little  hair top.  One hair top plug. 
[01:38:00]  So why are you calling?  Because I walk in there  and you just abuse me  like usual  and I got to walk out of there  and it's just getting...  I'm getting used to it.  What am I supposed to do?  I was coming in there  for champagne.  Thank you.  Brian's horrified.  Something must have happened  to the phone.  That was a connection  or something.  A problem with the wire.  Yeah,  the cell phone's in the city.  I'm sure.  You get behind a building  and it just kind of  craps out.  I apologize  if Annoying Laf Anthony  is still listening.  We didn't really mean 
[01:38:30]  to do that.  Rick,  what's outside the studio?  Teen girl.  Pussah!  Brian,  do you want to hear  about our new idea?  Vaginas!  Oh,  wow.  How long did it take  to come up  with this concept?  Sit around a big  round table.  Vaginas!  Let's brainstorm  storm for something  to do,  something to talk about. 
[01:39:00]  Pussah!  I second that.  That's a great idea.  We got, um...  We're going to do  a teen car wash.  Yeah,  we're doing  teen squeegee girls.  Yeah?  Around the city.  All right.  Good idea, right?  Mm-hmm.  You've been on  a lot of radio shows.  It's a good idea, right?  I've not heard  of this one.  It's cool, man.  A little different?  Yeah.  Going to get the teens  in their little belly shirts  to wash everyone's cars. 
[01:39:30]  Nice.  Right?  This summer,  people's cars get dirty.  Sure.  Sure.  So there was a guy  that called us  earlier this week  and he said  he has a boatload  of teens  he wanted to bring by.  Some kind of  teen girl pimp.  I don't know  what this guy's all about,  but...  So, Rick,  he's here with his teens?  A boatload.  He actually also wants  to, I guess,  give away one of the girls  to Earl  or something like that  he mentioned to us.  Oh, boy.  You can ask him  about that  when you get in.  All right.  This could be  really annoying.  All right.  They looked hot,  but this could be  really annoying.  Bring on the teens. 
[01:40:00]  Bring on the teen swats.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Well, so far  I'm seeing guy,  guy, guy.  Oh, there they are.  Hi.  Hey.  Oh, hi.  Hi, teen girls.  Oh, my golly.  Imagine if you were a car  getting fluffed with that.  They have their fluff.  Oh, well,  thank you, girls.  Oh, yes.  They have their little fluffers.  Look at this.  It's like a fluffer.  They got little belly shirts on.  Yes, they do.  Look at that.  You guys are teen girls, right? 
[01:40:30]  All right.  So who's responsible for this?  Me.  I'm Jordan.  Who?  Where?  Where are you?  Jordan out.  Hey, talking to the mic.  All right.  And where do you get these teenagers from?  I just called around.  You guys said get a couple by Friday.  I brought them in.  I get more for the car wash.  This studio smells great right now, doesn't it?  Brian, what are you wearing?  I like the technique of just calling around.  I didn't think to do that when I was a teenager looking for girls.  Just call around.  Just call around.  Hey, you got any teenage girls in that house?  Just calling around trying to find one. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, dude, what?  You didn't know any pigs or anything?  How the hell does this happen?  He gets like all hot girls.  Are they all friends?  We're rock stars.  Are you rock stars?  Almost.  And we have a present for you guys.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What's that?  We know you have an extensive porn collection, but this is our prized possession.  American Bukkake won.  The original.  It's what started it all.  And what is what started it all?  The whole sensation was started with this single thing.  What is this?  You don't know Bukkake? 
[01:41:30]  Not familiar with the Bukkake.  Brian, are you familiar with the Bukkake?  I know.  I feel silly not knowing about it.  Do you want me to explain it?  I think...  You can't.  You can't.  No.  You can't explain it.  No, I can do it without giving it away completely.  How?  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's not about giving away the ending that we're worried about it.  Don't ruin it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Steve, go whisper to Anthony what it is.  Yeah.  Steve, come here real quick. 
[01:42:00]  Don't say a word, guys.  Turn my mic off.  Steve is the expert of porno.  All right.  Turn my mic off.  This isn't porno.  This is Bukkake.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Steve is explaining it to Anthony.  Anthony looks completely intrigued.  Wait, wait.  Can I jump in?  I overheard it.  He said it was investment planning strategy.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  Why can't you talk about investment planning strategies?  It's sweeping Westchester.  Started in Somers.  We've practiced.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Bukkake. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Picture a bunch of guys standing around making a fribble in a glass.  Yes.  They make a fribble in a glass and then force feed it to a lady.  It's an Asian thing.  All right?  What a funnel.  I need to back up.  With a funnel?  I haven't been in a lot of bars.  More of me.  You know what a fribble is from Friendly's?  It's a milkshake.  Oh, okay.  So a bunch of guys, multiple guys, make a big fribble milkshake and then with a funnel  feed it to women.  Yeah.  We have the Bukkake Challenge where you watch that and drink a glass of milk. 
[01:43:00]  Yes.  Well, I'm going to pop that right in the old VCR.  Sure.  Nice.  Every collection should have one.  So why don't we have the girls introduce themselves, their name and their age?  One by one.  Go to this mic over here.  There you go.  What's your name?  My name's Tori.  I'm 18.  18-year-old Tori.  My name's Veronica.  I'm 18.  My name's Candace.  I'm 18.  Wow.  My name's Amber.  I'm 18.  I'm Kelly.  I'm 18.  My name's Tracy.  I'm 18. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  That just gets a round of applause.  You know what this sounds like?  I'm Brian.  I'm 42.  I should be like in another room somewhere.  You know what that just sounded like?  Like the cheerleader intro on ESPN.  That's why we did it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And all you ladies want to do the team car wash?  Yeah.  They're all conveniently 18.  That's fantastic.  Very convenient, isn't it?  It's like this was like for potential evidence, you know? 
[01:44:00]  And let's go back and review the tape.  18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18.  We have a wower today, Tov.  Who's the wower?  The chosen one.  Oh, really?  The chosen one.  You're going to whip them out Friday.  Why do they call you the chosen one?  Because she is.  Yeah?  They pick me because I have a nipple ring.  Oh, how about that?  Are they going to dump out a nipple?  Who knows?  She's got, let's just say, various piercings, blah, blah, blah.  I see she's got one in her belly.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Brian, you better turn your head.  Yeah, Brian, you don't want to see 18-year-old girls bare breasts, do you?  No.  Brian doesn't understand the whole look them out Wednesday.  It's on the radio so I can pretend like I'm turning my head.  Yeah.  Okay.  Go ahead, the chosen one.  Sure.  Wow.  Look at that.  Fresh off the griddle.  Right?  Those are nice.  Brian, comment.  I know I've got to get my car washed.  Like a snare drum.  Those are going to take the gravity of Jupiter to pull down. 
[01:45:00]  Wonderful.  My God.  Or the Andromeda Strain, Brian.  Well, we have girls.  Now we need a place for the teen car wash.  Right here in our studio.  And, okay, I'm the Chevy.  What are you?  Wonderful.  My God.  Huh?  Proposition.  Yeah.  We wanted to give away one of the girls, the black girl, for some stickers.  He doesn't deserve crap.  What are you talking about?  Are you guys pimps?  What are you pimping out these girls to?  We're rock stars.  We're rock stars. 
[01:45:30]  How do you know these ladies, really?  They're in school.  School?  Yeah.  We actually made a stripper once.  We find them.  We give them a place in the world.  It's what we do.  Really?  We met one girl, a rabbi's daughter.  We got her to strip.  We had our own personal stripper, which we made money off of.  She made 5% of all profits.  5%?  You guys are worse than pimps.  Off her own tips.  And we made a place called the Twottage.  Yeah.  This little hut thing.  It's like a cottage, only the Twottage. 
[01:46:00]  Exactly.  Very clever use of words there.  We're thinkers.  We're thinkers.  The Twottage.  Amber, what's up?  Hello.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just want to know, can I come down there and do the car wash?  How old are you?  I'm 19.  You old bitch.  Yeah, sure.  Why are you calling the old bitch?  She's 19?  Yeah, please.  I could tell that was a guy.  Stop it.  Not even working.  So what are the ladies going to do today?  They're going to clean a little bit?  Yeah, they came.  They brought some cleaning utensils.  You're going to dust the studio?  Dust it. 
[01:46:30]  We had a mop, some sponges.  Wow.  How about that?  Yes.  They're all wearing very short shorts, which is a nice, very nice legs on all of them.  Start cleaning, girls.  Start cleaning, girls.  Let the cleaning begin.  Normally, that would be Pete Johnson's job to clean the studio.  They're cleaning Brian Regan.  You know, annoying laugh Anthony is going to be on his way back here.  I thought they were cleaning. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, they're cleaning equipment.  I thought they were cleaning equipment.  That's what you call it, Ed, huh?  We have another play on words where they're going to fluff you, you know, in porn.  Oh, the fluff.  See, I like twatage better.  Twatage, funny.  Very funny.  All right.  This is good.  All right.  They have to sing happy birthday to one of our friends.  It's his birthday.  Yeah?  All right.  Why don't we get all the ladies around one mic?  Yeah, get them around the mic, ladies.  All right.  Would you like to do this with just your panties on or? 
[01:47:30]  I keep forgetting the R-18.  I keep thinking, like, they're 16 and we've got to be careful.  All right.  Ladies, when are you ready?  Ready?  Go.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Hoosah!  Happy birthday, dear man.  Hoosah!  Happy birthday to you.  Birthday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it. 
[01:48:00]  You take it now.  All right.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Basically, these ladies are at your disposal.  Anything you need done around the office?  I still haven't figured this relationship out with you and these girls.  Well, I told you, we're setting up little fight clubs based on you guys, sort of.  That's good.  And you're...  We want more.  If you want to email me.  And you're getting girls through this.  Yeah.  No, we're starting an army.  Go to 52956 at AOL.com if you want to join the ONA fight club.  Or Sharp518 at AOL.com.  How many of the girls were forced to come here today? 
[01:48:30]  You were forced?  You were forced?  My girlfriend, actually.  Under knife point or gun point or something?  I think the fact that these guys are taking 95% is...  Yeah.  We rule.  That's what you call a red flag.  We rule.  We rule.  95% and a rabbi's daughter.  Oh, my God.  Someone suggested we get...  We won't give away age for legal casualties or possibilities, but...  Someone suggested we get the couch in. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  What a massive...  We could get her if you guys don't check IDs.  What?  The stripper.  Wrong bad terms, but we could bring her back any time.  Oh, the stripper was underage?  No, I think we better keep her out of the studio.  We could cut her off, but we could bring her back any time.  Can we get a picture of the teens for the website?  Someone's asking.  Some of them don't want their picture taken.  How about from the back?  That's good, too.  You pixelate.  You pixelate the face out.  That's always great.  Pixelated face.  I've never been able to spank one out to a pixelated face picture. 
[01:49:30]  Brian, I don't know what you're used to, but...  I've never been able to finish that way.  I get pixelated monthly.  Hey, does Brian have any jokes on teens?  Yeah, I'm with a teen girl.  That's great.  Not an ounce of body fat between all of them.  Look at that.  Isn't that amazing?  We rule, right?  You rule, guys.  When we rock, we rock hard.  All right.  Gary Condit is on the line.  Gary. 
[01:50:00]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Yes.  Yes.  This sounds very interesting.  I'm wondering if any of the young ladies will be available for some work in Washington.  Ah.  Yes.  Gary Condit.  Would you be interested in a teen girl to maybe do some interning duties?  Yes.  Well, that sounds very fascinating.  You know, I passed my lie detector test today.  Yeah, I heard.  I heard.  Yeah, so we're right back in business, boys.  Good for you, Congressman.  Hey, what was that drop of blood they found in your bathroom? 
[01:50:30]  What drop?  Excuse me?  They found a drop of...  Oh, my cell phone's cutting out here, Jeff.  Hold on.  Oh, is that it?  Gary?  Hello, Gary.  We lost Gary Condit.  He's gone.  Well, he passed the lie detector test, so he's back in business, like he says.  Well, ladies, wow.  What can we say?  They're perfect for what we're looking for.  You guys do truly rock.  Yeah.  Bringing...  We have our numbers for any of the stuff that you guys do when you're on the road shows.  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  We want to be known as your teen pimps.  Teen pimps.  Well, you were known by that name the second you called.  We were calling you teen pimps.  And these ladies will be washing cars when we figure out where we're going to do it.  Your girl's going to school or anything, or...  Yep.  What grade are you all in?  You're going to college.  Anybody working or anything?  You got jobs or anything?  Yeah, I work.  Yeah, you work and go to school?  Wait, let's ask their summer jobs.  That could be fun.  Yeah.  All right, let's go down the line.  What's your summer job?  Your name and your summer job.

I work at Abercrombie and Fitch.  Oh, really?  Wait a second.  One of these is not like the other. 
[01:52:00]  Very nice.  Wow, all right.  He mixed up dead birds.  I'm trying so hard to think up more questions.  I know.  Why don't the girls leave the studio and huddle and think about what they want to do for us today?  Why?  Do you think you could come up with something?  Yeah, they could come up with more stuff, I'm sure.  Teen, lesbian, couch.  Do any of you girls ever have a girl-girl experience?  One second.  Don't.  I want the girls to just naturally talk about her, you know, whatever they want to talk about. 
[01:52:30]  The pimp guy just slapped one of them across the face and said, you'll do what I say.  You'll do what I say.  You're my bitch.  You got the other one by the throat.  Anyone ever experiment with anything with a friend or something like that?  Anyone have a story like that they want to talk about?  Yeah, the girls usually have to get a little older before they start divulging those stories.  Wait till you get to college.  Wait till you get out of college.  It'll just be like, yeah, when I was 19, holy, I was...  Had my face in more muffins. 
[01:53:00]  Well, it happens.  All right, ladies.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, girls.  Very good.  Very nice.  Teen car wash girls all lined up.  Jesus Christ.  When we do the teen car wash, you'll see them for yourself.  Guys, walk out first.  There you go.  All right, now, ladies.  Bye.  Bye, girls.  There they go.  Ladies, there they go.  Very nice.  Okay, yeah, look at that.  Look at the jeans.  I want the little red shorts.  There you go.  Teen girls.  Guys, take it 95%. 
[01:53:30]  What is that?  You know, Eddie was proud of that they were giving the girl 5%.  She gets 5% of all the money that comes in.  Wow.  High school, I'm standing around trying my best to buy enough weed to get laid.  These guys, what are they doing?  How do they do that?  You got some kind of hypnotizing spell or something?  Stinky.  Do you know the deal with those guys?  Calling door to door.  They're teen pimps.  They swear by it.  Well, they're good at it.  Oh, yeah.  Look who heard. 
[01:54:00]  Look who heard.  There were teen girls down here, and he shows up.  See that?  You saw the one with the red shorts, all right?  Hey, Brian, did you ever meet old Dirty?  Hey, man.

Tonight and tomorrow night.  Old Dirty's floating around here somewhere as well.  Teen girls outside the studio cleaning everything in sight. 
[01:56:30]  What are they doing that for?  We just need a place to hold the teen car wash in and it will be happening.  Yeah.  Sooner than later, hopefully.  You should see them out there.  All their cell phones are ringing and it's their boyfriends and whatnot.  I heard one on the phone and she's just going, nothing, just shorts.  You know, like obviously wondering what she was wearing.  And what she did.  Right.  Right.  All right.  You're all clothed. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Yes, Brian.  That's right.  They are clothed.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Brian.  You're all.  Hey.  I just recently got my own place and was having trouble with the phone company.  Can you relate at all?  Oh, I can relate to that.  Oh, really?  Tell me about it.  It's even a secondary.  A secondary.  A secondary.  Oh, tell me about it.  Tell me.  You know, you got to get the phone turned on, you know.  I was at my friend's house when I did. 
[01:57:30]  I called the phone company and I was like, yeah, can you turn on my telephone?  Okay, it's going to be a problem.  I figured.  How much?  So, you know, they come out and, you know, the whole thing is just such a trip, you know.  It's like, yeah, can you just, what do I have to do?  Do I have to wait down here for a few days for the phone people?  And they're like, no, we can just flip the switch from right here.  I'm like, oh, good.  Can you go ahead and flip it? 
[01:58:00]  We're going to flip it next Thursday.  Can you flip it now?  We're going to flip it Thursday or Friday or the following Monday or on into November.  Hey, can you see it from where you're at?  Can I come down and flip it?  See, I figure they must just have like one flip switcher, you know, and he's got a lot to get to.  He's just walking around.  And then maybe it's one big giant switch, you know, and he's just standing there like a weightlifter. 
[01:58:30]  Man, he's never going to get to my house.  I don't know, man.  I don't know if that helps you.  Maybe that helps.  Yeah, I think it helps.  I don't know what he's looking for.  Switch guys.  Yeah, you're getting a phone turn on.  It's not an easy thing.  Old Dirty can relate to that, right? 
[01:59:00]  You don't have any phone service, right?  You got a phone problem?  Dirty?  Yeah, they turned the, actually, they flipped the switch down.  Oh, they turned it off on you.  So, you pay the bill, old Dirty.  Nah, I haven't paid.  Nah?  You probably can't even get the phone because now they got all kinds.  If your phone got turned off in the ancient days, you used to just be able to call up and get it turned on again.  Now they just know, you know, back in 1968, you missed a payment.  And like they know not to turn your phone back on.  They got all the info on you.  Yeah.  But what I'm saying is they got the whole building monopolized. 
[01:59:30]  I mean, what, I mean, it's going to take me a little time to get the bell on time, you know?  Just chill, man.  So, you're chilling with the calling cards and the, uh...  Nah, nah, I get my free phone service, though.  You're free?  I just, I communicate freely.  Nobody could contact me, though.  Oh, so you could make outgoing calls.  Outgoing calls for free.  It's an unusual service.  So, it's like, hey, maybe we can meet at 8 o'clock. 
[02:00:00]  Let me put it this way.  I will meet you at 8 o'clock.  Exactly.  He's got another scam, Brian.  One-sided calling from Verizon.  Haven't heard that spot yet.  That's great.  You can't quite make the payments on the two-way calling.  Tell them about your scam with the pay phone.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they shut us down, though, man.  Got a little too notorious, the corner.  Well, the line shouldn't snake all the way around the block. 
[02:00:30]  Well, yeah, we try to get the customers on a time schedule thing.  But, you know, the soccer game came on, Columbia against somebody.  It was the Copa America.  Right.  So, you know, they were calling the homeland and stuff.  What was the scam?  Yeah, explain the scam.  Oh, we had a pay phone rigged up to make international calls for, like, $5, $10, depending on what area call you were calling.  I'm not.  This is illegal, isn't it? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Brian, it's called free enterprise.  I am kind of thrown by this whole thing.  Brian, you're involved in illegal activity now.  Am I an accomplice now that I'm explaining how this is done?  What he would do, he'd have a pay phone that was rigged up to make these free international calls.  And then people would line up, but not near the phone, because that's a tip-off.  So they're around the corner on this big, long line.  And then the guy at the phone would wave on the next guy.  Like, did you ever see the escape sequence in The Great Escape? 
[02:01:30]  Yes.  Where the tunnel was too short and you needed the guy to wave up the other guy.  That was the same system, because you don't want the Gestapo in the tower seeing you.  Okay, so you're all in line, but you've got to pretend like you're in line for something else.  You've got to be going, man, I can't wait to get my hot dog.  No, we used to tell the clients to go to the bodega and, you know, kill a little time over there until their turn came up.  And then we started, like, breaking them up into groups.  What if it's in an area that doesn't have a bodega?  No, no.  There's a bodega on every block.  Something tells me this scam's only going down where there was a nearby bodega. 
[02:02:00]  So then we broke them up into groups, so it looked more like a gathering type thing.  But then that started catching the attention of the authorities, you know.  Right.  And it was a loitering problem, and it got too noisy.  So you would say five bucks, you step up to the phone, you make your call.  How long do you get?  Wait, but was there something you had to do to the phone?  Because who's guarding the phone when you're not around doing your business?  Oh, we have associates that have certain positions within our establishments.  Sure. 
[02:02:30]  You know, in the phone companies.  You got to give them a nice title.  Yeah.  So, you know, everybody had their thing.  So if somebody went up to the actual pay phone, you had to discourage that because you're all tapped in somewhere else.  Oh, yeah.  But that was four other phones on that side that were encouraged to use the other ones.  Encouraged.  They're being used by other entrepreneurs for similar ventures.  So when you came up to the first phone, you know, to get it rigged up, and you're standing  there with a monkey wrench and all kinds of wiring, does anybody ask any questions?  We're technologically advanced where I come from. 
[02:03:00]  So how do you actually get the phone to make these free calls?  Oh, you don't want to give a...  That's the rub.  Macy's.  Corporate secret.  Bloomingdale's, kid.  No way.  No, okay.  It's our little...  I got you.  You got a technician.  What do you think, Brian?  Right?  Good.  I like it, man.  Nice, right?  I'd like to use that.  It'd be nice and convenient to go, I'm going to give you a call tomorrow.  I've got to go wait in a long line.  When it's my turn, I'll give you a buzz.  Yo, Brian, you want to invest in our little venture?  Let's be able to open it up again. 
[02:03:30]  Investment opportunities.  We're going public, B.  On the NASDAQ.  Old Dirty's phone company down a quarter today when certain people were arrested in front  of the phone.  The SEC's investigating now.  Right.  We consider Brian Regan a friend, obviously, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  And we'd like to share with Brian, right?  I think he needs to...  Have you ever met the retarded Laverne Shirley?  Oh, what are they doing here?  Why are they here today? 
[02:04:00]  We just had teen girls in.  The palate was cleansed.  You're going to dirty it up.  We just had a high colonic of teen girls, and now you're going to put some red meat back  in our intestines.  Brian's a nice guy.  Hey.  Hey.  Hi.  Get away from me.  You and that.  What are you going to do about that perm, man?  What are you going to do about that perm, man?  I'm getting a cut.  Nice meeting you, too.  Hi, ladies.  I heard so much about you.  Oh, my God.  Look at Brian's horrifying.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you. 
[02:04:30]  How are you?  All right.  Let's go.  What?  What's that?  What is that?  What do you have?  You got bling bling.  I think you're wearing what they call bling bling.  Ladies and gentlemen, you got some bling bling.  You got some bling bling.  What is that, Alder?  That's tin tin.  That ain't no bling bling.  That's bling bling.  Tin tin.  Ain't no bling bling.  Tin tin.  Man.  My poodle got a ticket chain in there.  I hope he did.  Do you want to check the 14-year-old?  I was not looking anywhere near that little medallion around the night. 
[02:05:00]  We came in for another white t-shirt contest, guys.  Yeah, why not?  You are like one of the homies with a lot of the gold chains around you.  You're like Mrs. T.  Psycho Mark said I look like Mr. T.  Right.  Yeah, Mr.  Mrs. T, rather.  I pity the bald fools see me naked.  Yo, them chains are so thin.  We had such a good time.  Oh, my God.  You don't talk over me.  I'll be quiet.  Those chains are so thin, not even a crackhead's going to rob me.  You got, like, half a penny weight around your neck. 
[02:05:30]  You got, come on, my dear.  You're going to spend money on jewelry, my.  You got to come see me.  And I spent some money on jewelry.  You got to melt that down and make, like, a cap or something.  No.  What is that, yo?  They're chains.  They're chains.  That's not me saying this.  That's all dirty.  You work in a jewelry store?  Are you working in a jewelry store?  Are they a little thin?  Is that what the problem is?  A little thin.  What's that doing?  You need the real heavy gold.  Let's ask Brian, Anthony.  Brian, I think they look nice. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you very much.  Brian's a nice guy, man.  Nice little touch, you know?  A little color.  Brian, where's the little color?  One says, well, one says, okay, terrific, and the other one says, oh, and a.  Yeah.  Hey, Brian, where's your bling bling?  I'm going to go get some right now.  Now that I realize how good it looks.  Got to go to the bling bling store.  Fix them up.  Ladies, why are you here?  We figured we'd take a walk over here.  We had nothing to do tonight.  We figured we'd walk around Manhattan.  You're just walking around.  I need the exercise.  Oh, yeah, you do.  Pushing that perm around.  Hey, how do you push that perm around in the wind? 
[02:06:30]  I'm getting a haircut anyway next week.  Are you getting that cut off?  What are you going to do?  No, I'm getting it trimmed again.  I just got it trimmed three weeks ago.  What are you doing?  The perm's a little tight still.  No, it's fine.  A little tight.  Hey, it was okay last Saturday because I had it back.  That's all white, isn't it?  I didn't get a haircut.  Yeah, you got that dead hair.  You got that dead hair like your jewelry.  Hey, can I ask you guys something?  It's all about Brian Regan right now, Marianne.  I'm going to ask you guys something before I forget. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Because I forget a lot.  Are you guys having another road show?  Like the way you stayed last Saturday?  What do you think?  What do you think?  I'm only asking you.  Brian's shocked.  Brian's just looking around like, what's happening?  I thought I would ask if you guys are going to do another one like last Saturday.  Yeah, you had a good one.  Who, me?  Where were you?  I was just there.  Oh, my God.  Listen.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  We just wanted to know.  Hey, Marianne, it's not every day that Brian is in the studio.  No, no, go ahead. 
[02:07:30]  I don't mean to interrupt.  No, no, no, no.  You're not interrupting at all.  No, it's nice to have you.  Nice to have you.  Shout out to some people.  It's a big tent plus.  Point to you, here it is.  Point to you, here it is, what she has to say.  Well, no, I was thinking maybe you could, you know, show Brian the love and maybe, you  know, flash Brian.  Oh, man.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do you guys have an act that you do?  Oh, yeah.  No, this is what they do.  This is the act.  What else can we say?  Hey, Anthony, I might ask what's dancing on stage with him last night.  Right.  Yes, it was.  It was.  You guys were dancing and you were topless as you were dancing. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, my.  Hey, Marianne, would you mind flashing?  Oh, Brian, because he wasn't at the road show.  What is it?  Is it bling bling or bling bling?  I wasn't flashing.  I didn't flash at the road show.  Just blink, blink until your eyes are closed.  Blink, blink.  I didn't flash at the road show.  You were flashing.  I know.  Shout out.  Hey, we saw it.  Lady Di?  I know.  Lady Di?  Yes.  Would you do the flash for Brian, please?  There's no cameras or anything.  No cameras?  No.  I promise.  Brian would love to see your...  This isn't happening? 
[02:08:30]  Yes, it is.  Oh!  This isn't happening?  That's what you say, like, right before you're being tortured.  This isn't happening.  It isn't happening.  That's hot, right, Brian?  Hot.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, Brian.  How do you...  How do you...  How do you guys...  You know, you're proud of yourself.  That's cool.  Right.  Self-esteem.  What does Lady Di want to say?  Because we've got to get Brian out of here in a few minutes.  Can I give a shout out to some people at the Station House Bar in Elizabeth, New Jersey?  Everybody says hi. 
[02:09:00]  Elizabeth?  Isn't that like...  Like, where they got all the containers and all the ships driving sailors and all that  kind of grimy out there?  Kind of grimy.  That's Elizabeth Port.  But we don't live in Elizabeth Port.  Yeah, don't be touching the mic.  You and your lisp and your...  That's okay.  My lisp is fine.  Mm-hmm.  I got to lisp because I didn't want braces when I was younger.  Is that what happened?  I was just fine.  You hear this?  Is that what happened, Mary?  Yeah.  You didn't want braces?  Is that why you had that whistle?  Yeah.  Why not?  I don't want them.  Braces are fine.  Yeah.  I had braces, but... 
[02:09:30]  I had braces, but...  Yeah, this is their act, Brian.  They're going to love it.  It's a good act.  They need an opening act?  Brian's a good act.  A little yin and yang.  Yeah.  So, hey, you know what?  They used to call us that when we were in our 20s.  Really?  Ying and yang.  Ying and yang.  There you go.  When we were in our 30s, we got called other stuff.  They used to call us that in high school.  30s.  We got to bring back the old team.  Yang and yang.  What's our saying?  Ying and yang party.  Party.  I hit the nail right on the head.  That's it.  What a way to start off the party.  Ying and yang party. 
[02:10:00]  Of course.  You missed it last Saturday.  You would have had a good time.  You were bumping donuts with the other one.  I was having a good time.  You two were in the lesbian pool.  I don't care.  I had a great time.  And you know what?  I haven't had that much fun.  I don't know how long.  Really?  I'm serious.  And your husband wasn't with you?  Hey, let me tell you one thing.  My husband took all the pictures, and he told me, as long as you had a good time,  he took us out by the train station, took her home.  How about that?  Tony, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Good.  Hey, I'm going to get my wisdom teeth pulled next week, and I was wondering if Brian Regan 
[02:10:30]  could kind of help me out with that.  I'd feel awkward getting into that when we got ying and yang here.  The only thing else I got last week was this.  What?  Who punched you?  You're party girls now?  What happened?  We've been party girls.  We've always been party girls.  We've always been party girls.  Why?  Brian.  Sign it.  Oh, my God.  She has a cassette tape.  Who has cassette tapes? 
[02:11:00]  She has a cassette tape on Brian Regan's great CD.  I'll sign your A-track.  Lady Di, what are you doing with cassettes still?  What am I doing with a cassette player?  Lady Di, like L.A.  DVD, CD players are, like, dirt cheap now.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Brian, where are you playing at?  OD, how much for a CD player now?  How much?  You want one for the hoop?  These 50, 45, 50 bucks.  45, 50 bucks for a CD player.  I also have a CD.  I would like for you guys to listen to one of these days. 
[02:11:30]  What is that?  Yeah, sure.  What is it?  Break it, Opie.  No, Opie ain't going to break that.  I don't know where she got it from, so I'm going to make it.  What is it?  It's a CD, Evelyn Forever.  What is it, a CD of?  What is it?  Anthony, what's the title?  It's called Evelyn Forever.  What is this?  It's Evelyn.  What is this?  It's a rock and roll CD.  From who?  From who?  From a band.  I believe they're from South Jersey.  And you know them?  Is that their name?  Evelyn Forever? 
[02:12:00]  I know one of the producers, Joel.  Oh, I see what you're trying to do here.  Slip in a plug-in.  Opie, maybe.  He's a friend of mine.  Well, we've gotten CDs in the past, and oh, my God.  It's in the CD player.  Opie!  Opie just put it in the CD player.  Ryan's horrible.  He did put it on the CD player.  Oh, my God.  I have another one.  Opie!  I have another one at home.  Opie, could you guys just listen to him before you broke it?  Oh, my God.  Opie filed it. 
[02:12:30]  It's fine.  He put it in an appropriate place.  What happened back there, Opie?  He's going to listen to it later.  What is this?  Smash CD Friday or what?  Did that slip out of your fingers?  Ryan's the nicest guy in the world.  He can't believe when you hung up on that guy.  That was bad enough.  Hey, I'm glad I don't have my Soprano CD on me.  It probably was smashed down on me, too.  Oh, my God.  I got a Soprano.  I have to go get another one now.  That one shattered.  Soprano was wrong.  That was cheap quality.  What's wrong with that thing?  What's wrong with that thing?  You just set it on the stack over there.  It exploded.  I'm sorry, Soprano. 
[02:13:00]  That's how whack it was.  That's how whack it was.  Your old beat is exploding when you set it down.  It's like nachoglycerin or something.  I thought you were the nicer one.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Yeah, I am.  Good thing you didn't hand it, Soprano.  Are you having a bad day today?  No.  Yeah, and he smashes everything.  Oh, I know.  That's why I have two.  Brian's one of my favorite comedians, and he hasn't even been able to talk to a lot.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  That's fine.  I'm waiting for him to say something. 
[02:13:30]  I would like to get a copy of that, though.  Lady Di, you have a shirt now.  She has a shirt now that says Lady Di, and the L in it is exactly like Laverne's L from Laverne and Shirley.  That's perfect, isn't it?  Yeah.  I have three of them.  Oh.  And then Marian's got a cute little flower number on there with matching shorts.  Where'd you pick that up?  With the white stockings.  Thank you.  Where'd you pick that up?  I have my clothes.  Hey, Marian.  Marian, I got to tell you something, and this is a God's honest truth. 
[02:14:00]  I have a great aunt in Astoria.  She has the same top.  Where'd she get it from?  She's 96 years old.  Swear to God.  What?  That's the style now.  I'm just saying, you know.  That's the style.  Is that the style now, O.D.?  These two are living back in the 50s, though.  Flowers.  Flowers, man.  They never go out of style.  Ben Spence is slobbing stuff at Marian's.  He's doing tit tags.  They were flower children.  It almost looks like a pot leaf, Marian. 
[02:14:30]  Now, if you had a little marijuana leaf print on that shirt, I could understand that.  Where is Steve today?  Hey, I'm, um, ladies.  On vacation, I guess, right?  Oh, my God.  They just babble.  Worse than Anthony.  Limo Anthony.  Ladies, Brian Regan's getting very annoyed.  No, I'm not.  Hey, Opie, how is this guy going to talk?  I'm waiting for him to say something.  Look how much you're pissing off Brian Regan, man.  Brian's never been so furious.  No, it's good having you guys here.  You know, we're all hanging out, doing our thing. 
[02:15:00]  I'm here.  You want to wait here?  I'm a party.  Jing and yang party.  You know?  Everything about him.  Hey, you're a party.  We're all talking, having fun.  Brian was on Letterman recently.  Yeah.  I'm sure Letterman gave him a little more respect than this.  No, it's great.  That's great.  Hey, let me tell you guys.  You guys had a lot of fun last Saturday.  Especially with us.  Oh, my God.  We know.  We talked about it for two days.  You kept telling us to have fun.  All right, Marian. 
[02:15:30]  I was?  Marian, you're going to show Brian your boobs?  No.  Why?  Marian, those are the ones you've got to see.  I saw.  I saw.  Like, you saw Lady Di's, but Marian's are the ones, man.  Those are guns, man.  They could.  So we have no cameras on.  Marian's the hot one.  You did it, the road.  Wow.  Look at that.  You see that bra?  Did you see that white bra she's wearing?  That's hot.  That's fashionable, too.  Yeah.  That's hot.  No, Marian's hotter.  She's got those big guns, man.  She's got the huge guns.  I like that.  I heard the big, too.  All right, listen. 
[02:16:00]  Listen, ladies.  This has been wonderful.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, yeah.  Can you leave so we can talk to Brian?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  I'm glad to say hi.  And, Brian, I like you so much.  I'm waiting for Brian to just snap.  All right.  Yeah, leave.  Oh, you don't want us to leave, Anthony.  You had a good time.  Hey, why don't we go and dance on stage again?  Come on.  Let's go.  What the hell?  What did you do to these two?  Hey, you want to...  All I know is my band was playing, we're on stage, these two come up and start dancing  and taking their tops off on stage, and I was just horrified. 
[02:16:30]  I couldn't...  I can almost...  I couldn't continue.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Hey, I want to say one thing, man.  Yeah.  Brian.  Yes?  The big, stupid one is Lady Di.  Look at that tie-in.  Brings it right back together, huh?  Over and out, man.  From my act.  Why don't you guys...  You want to dance with Brian or something?  No, I'll do it.  No, I can't do it.  I got it.  I would love it.  Play some music.  I got to go.  I'm into dancing, so... 
[02:17:00]  All right, listen.  We got to get Brian out of here.  And the nerds I knew from when I had my house down the shore.  Oh, my gosh.  Okay, listen.  They just babble.  Oh, God.  Babble.  We have...  We don't babble at you.  Is that...  What are those?  Pictures of...  That ain't me.  Is that you guys in the lesbian pool?  Oh, my God.  Look at Lady Di.  Oh, my God.  That is...  Hey, that...  It's a little publicity photo.  That ain't me.  Let me see that one, Brian.  I think it's the same one.  Oh, it is the same shot because you need two.  Wow, look at that. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my...  What is that smell?  What are you...  Yo, which one do you broke with?  Not me.  Yeah, you got nervous in...  I saw your fluttering shorts.  I don't have fluttering shorts.  Did you guys fart?  I wish I was.  Oh, my God.  Holy...  I got to go.  Holy...  Oh, no.  Hey, Brian, what do you think of that fart?  Hey, who did that, man?  I'd like to see anyone come out to Bananas.  Who did that?  Mess up.  Marion.  Did you fart, Marion?  No.  Brian, snap. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know where we're going.  Snap right now, Brian.  Lose it.  Holy...  Brian's in the blast zone, and he's still being polite.  You're unbelievable.  You're at ground zero.  Brian.  I wasn't about to say something.  And you said it right out your butt.  No, I didn't say it right out my butt.  You farted, Marion.  Gee, it's sad.  Lady Di did, then.  Hey, Brian, you don't mind to fart every once in a while, right?  No.  You know, sometimes people have to do their thing.  It's true, because I didn't do anything.  Want me to take a lie detector?  I didn't do it.  That was rough.  Ladies, it's not that time of the month, is it? 
[02:18:30]  No.  That's over with.  That was last week.  Oh, I thought that was over with for good.  I thought that's what you were saying.  No, I thought that's what you were saying.  Holy ass, that stinks.  It still stinks in here.  Jesus Christ.  Ben, stop it.  Ben, spray him down.  Spray him down.  Oh, come on.  Spray him down.  Spray him down with the pledge.  All we could find was lemon pledge.  That'll work.  Where does she got to go, please? 
[02:19:00]  Ladies, come on.  Stop with the farting.  I got to tell where to go.  It smells like somebody ran over a skunk.  Where do you have to go, Marion?  That's so important.  All right, listen.  Where do you have to go?  That's so important.  You guys, we're going to play your theme song.  That means it's the end of your segment.  Right.  All right.  And you get to go.  What's the song you want?  Huh?  Oh, it still stinks in here.  Ladies, leave.  It's not even diffusing or anything.  This isn't even a joke anymore.  Leave.  Goodbye.  Retarded Laverne and Shirley, thank you for coming by with your bling bling and your perms 
[02:19:30]  and everything else.  And here's their theme song.  It's quick.  It's stinks.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  We're facts.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up and we're nauseating.  With so annoying, no one can take it.  When we look in the mirror, we break it.  We'll give you nightmares all day long.  Like a couple of weevils, not a count of sex appeals. 
[02:20:00]  Make a sense for us, it's not possible.  A warthog and Godzilla in leather pants.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded.  Yes, we were born that way.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded.  Make any better game.  We won't go away.  And there they go, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Get some Rick's lighting matches in the studio.  That was one of the worst, most potent, most long-lasting farts that has ever happened in this studio.  And it was one of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  That wasn't you, Brian, right?  No, it wasn't.  Okay.  That was one of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  They let out a big gas bag.  Oh, my God, was that awful.  Well, it was interesting.  So what did you think of them, Brian? 
[02:21:00]  You know, I know they come out and watch your guys' thing.  Brian's a nice guy.  He's a diplomat, man.  You know what I'm saying?  How amazing is this guy?  He has nothing bad to say about anyone.  I was bludgeoned over the head.  They took my wallet.  But, you know, he needed the money.  Right.  Oh, my God.  These things will happen.  I'll heal.  I'll heal.  He didn't kill me.  He held off.  I could tell he was holding back on his blows.  I was brought up like Brian.  And then one day I woke up and realized what a crock of crap. 
[02:21:30]  So I went the other way.  It gets tiring.  It must be exhausting.  It must be exhausting.  Brian got the big house in Connecticut.  Get 3.5 kids, the Volvo station wagon.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, you just described him perfectly.  That half a kid.  Could you get this picture away?  Look at this thing.  Yeah, let me peep that.  I saw this picture on the news the other day.  The uncle wrestled it to the shore and they pulled an arm out of its mouth and reattached it. 
[02:22:00]  Lady Di in the lesbian pool.  Oh, my God.  Pumped four bullets in it.  Lady Di in the lesbian pool.  Cage goes in the pool.  You're in the cage.  Lady Di's in the water.  Our Lady Di.  Farewell and adieu to your first Spanish lady.  Oof.  All right.  She's a lot of woman, right?  Do we have to get you out of here?  I think I got a roll.  Yeah.  You got an 8 o'clock show.  It's Bananas and Hasbrook Heights.  Two shows tonight, two shows tomorrow.  Check them out.  Brian Regan. 
[02:22:30]  Brian wasn't able to talk for the last half hour, but he's really, really funny.  I love it, man.  I have a good time.  As long as you're watching and doing the whole nine yards.  Yeah.  We highly recommend you go see Brian Regan.  I'm going to one of the shows, but I will not be going backstage.  Oh, really?  You're not stalking?  I don't want him to think I'm stalking him.  Sending Lady Di and Marion backstage in lieu of us.  Yeah, I'll send that instead.  That'd be too weird.  How you doing?  I love you, Brian Regan.  I enjoyed the show.  Let me go now and recite the whole thing for you and tell you what parts I like. 
[02:23:00]  I guess I'll have a kind of a prank.  Brian, thank you very much.  Thank you, guys, man.  Appreciate you having me back.  Hey, where are you going to be in Columbus?  Because we're on in Columbus right now.  I'm at the Funny Bone in Columbus next week.  Next weekend?  And Bananas and...  Hasbro Kites tonight and tomorrow.  Hasbro Kites tonight and tomorrow.  Very good.  Along with my brother Dennis.  Dennis is working with me.  Ah, yeah.  Very funny, and he'll be on our show one of these days.  Cool.  Thank you, Brian.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Brian.  O.P.  Anthony.  We have our penises.  Thanks to all of our speaking. 
[02:23:30]  Thanks to all of the talking for us.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  And we're back to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:24:00]  Call free.  877-692-1027.  Poor Brian.  You put him in the worst positions.  Hilarious.  I see the uncomfortable look on his face when he's sitting there and things are going on.  And you have to say, you know, hey, Brian.  Didn't she retarded?  No, no.  Everyone's got their own unique personality. 
[02:24:30]  Did you see the look on his face when I shattered that CD?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lady Di gives him a CD of some band.  Opie, of course.  He's done it in the past plenty of times.  And he smashes it on the console.  Brian's just like, huh, what'd he do?  And Ben's doing Tic Tacs at him.  Ben's just lobbing Tic Tacs at Marion.  And one of them farted really bad.  Really bad.  And he took it outside, too.  Smelled, you know, one of those farts that smells like ammonia. 
[02:25:00]  No, it was, it smelled like.  There was a little ammonia in that.  Yeah.  You know why?  It was one of those oil refinery farts.  You know, one of those, it smells like a, like oil refinery or like the raw sewage plant.  One of those real thick ones, you know.  They got, they're viscous.  One of those farts where you feel it in your eyes.  Oh, your eyes start to tear.  Oh, my God.  Oh, right when it starts coming out, you're just like, uh-oh. 
[02:25:30]  You know, you could feel the texture of it is bad.  One of those.  Marion wanted to show me her Marion necklace that her husband gave her 10 years ago.  I didn't want to touch it because I thought I'd bend it in half.  Oh, yeah.  That's some thin gold.  I didn't know they make gold that thin.  Dude, they laugh at things like that in the community there, O'Day?  You put that kind of gold on a baby's neck, my brother.  Yeah, so they don't hurt themselves.  My nephew got a fatty chain in those chicks, yo. 
[02:26:00]  She's showing it, and you're afraid, yeah, it's just going to bend them,  just snap the chain or something.  Kind of flaps in the wind.  That's like the chain you got your girlfriend when you were like 14 years old,  and you're saved up and got this little thin gold chain.  Yeah, the main plate.  Ah, yeah.  J.D., what's up?  I feel honored.  It's like a little bit of history today.  The last time Brian Regan ever appears on your show.  No, he loves this stuff.  He's a trooper, man. 
[02:26:30]  The guy has been in for stuff that was much worse.  He was here for Sandy Kane.  My whole goal when Brian's in is to make him feel as uncomfortable as possible  because he doesn't see bad in anything.  You were successful, O.  Yeah, you're just a son.  You know, he didn't want to insult Lady Diomarian,  so when they farted, or one of them farted, Brian was in the blast zone.  Everyone else literally cleared out.  Oh, yeah.  It and I were pretty far away from the retarder,  Verner, Shirley, and Brian, but we could still smell it.  He was right on top of them. 
[02:27:00]  Ground zero.  And refused to move because he thought it would insult them.  He didn't cover his nose.  No, he stood there, and he was in that zone that, you know,  when you watch the atomic blast, the houses, like, implode and blow away.  That's where he was.  He was in that zone, and he sat there like a trooper,  not even squinting, and you know he was right in the cloud.  The guy is so, he's too nice.  Yeah, he is.  He's one of those go-white folks.  I want to be called, Opie, I know a lot of people recognize the name Opie and Anthony now, 
[02:27:30]  as far as on the radio, but I want to change it.  Ying and Yang.  Ying and Yang.  What do you say, me and you?  Ying and Yang, party!  What the hell was that?  Did people just punch them in school when they did that?  It's like, Ying and Yang, party, ow!  And they've been together since high school and all that.  They've got a history together.  Who else are they going to have?  You know what I'm saying?  It's not like they're going to have anyone else.  It's the two of them.  And that's it, kid.  And each other. 
[02:28:00]  Sad.  It's sad.  She's getting railed.  Like the Down Syndrome kid has, you know, the other Down Syndrome kid from, you know,  on the other side of town.  We noticed that when we were doing the blind boxing,  a lot of the blind guys knew each other.  They hang out at the blind thing.  When you get two retards like that, you know, Ying and Yang.  Are they still?  Just open the door for a second.  Dude, dude, they are laying on the couch high-fiving each other.  They think they're so great.  Because they heard you say Ying and Yang, party! 
[02:28:30]  Did you ever think what we used to say in high school would get, oh.  We're on the radio now.  Get them back in for a second.  We have to talk about that email, but...  We could...  Ladies, why are you high-fiving?  I guess I'll have a camera, man.  Huh?  What?  You like the Ying and Yang party?  We used to say it all the time.  Why?  Give us that again.  Which one?  Ying and Yang party!  Ying and Yang party!  Party, yay!  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:00]  Marion just smacked Lady Di in the nose with her high-five.  Well, they try to do the high-five, but you know when people can't do the high-five?  And they hit each other?  Well, with those glasses, she can't see anything too close to her head.  I got sort of a kind of a depth perception.  She's trying to call somebody.  That's right.  I'm not calling him now.  Put the phone down.  Oh, my God.  They just...  Oh!  Please put that phone down.  Guys, what kind of partying did you used to do? 
[02:29:30]  Tell us about the high school partying of you, too.  When you used to do the Ying and Yang party.  That was fun.  What do you used to do?  Anthony.  Open.  Party.  Party!  It's still a baggot.  Right.  It's a baggot.  So, what kind of partying did you used to do?  Yeah, you smoked a little herb.  Give us a little insight on a weekend night during high school for you, too.  We were 21.  Well, all right.  We were not 20.  Go ahead.  Give us a little insight on a hot weekend coming up.  Let it roll.  What happened?  Turtle races.  Right?  The turtle races.  The turtle races. 
[02:30:00]  The turtle races.  What are turtle races?  Turtles.  You put the turtles on a track?  Yeah.  You call them certain nations?  We used to go to turtle races.  I thought that was a code for, like, some kind of acid.  No.  But you're actually talking about turtle races.  Turtle races.  Dude, I did some turtle races last night.  I was seeing melting faces.  You've never heard of turtle races before?  No.  They had them.  They had them in Staten Island, right?  Turtle races?  Yeah.  That's all Pogarty's.  They had them in Clifton Island.  That's your, like, weekend night out? 
[02:30:30]  Friday night.  Yeah.  We used to drink.  We used to party.  And you'd party.  Yeah.  What was like, what were you doing?  Tequila?  Drinking.  Hey, how many races could you see in a night?  Smoking.  Yeah.  Do a little bit of...  One.  I don't want to say it.  I don't want to say it.  And then we would do some putt-putt golf.  Do a little bit of...  If we were really out of control, we'd go do some putt-putt golf.  Turtle races, ladies.  Turtle races, yes.  Yes.  Slow down.  What else did you used to do?  Oh, when we were crazy, we would go rock and ball.  We're just wild women.  Yes, yes, we did.  Rock and ball. 
[02:31:00]  Rock and ball.  Rock and ball.  Wild woman.  We used to dance.  Why?  When you guys...  We still do.  We stay out later and watch the midnight show of Laser Light Show.  No, sometimes.  We go to Planetary and watch the Laser Light Show.  Laser Floyd.  Laser Floyd.  So by the end of the night...  And stay up all night.  So wait a minute.  We used to stay up all night.  Yo, by the end of the night, the total races got to the finish line, right?  Yeah, really?  How long did that take?  Yes, they did.  It took like the whole night to get...  And you want a drink.  Yeah, and you want a drink.  So we used to drink on an offer for free.  On a particular turtle that you spent on.  On a particular turtle. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Right.  I got to get me some turtles.  The first one-fiftieth of the race in one hour and fifty seconds, they round the car  turn.  I don't think they do that anymore.  They haven't done that in like twelve years.  Well, yeah.  It's like gone, you know?  People fell lives.  Yeah.  What a coincidence, you know?  I used to...  That was a long...  That was years ago.  That was a long time ago.  I used to have it like in Belmar.  That was before TV, obviously.  I used to take acid and fire automatic weapons in the woods and, you know, you'd go to turtle  races.  And then after that, we used to go to her house and hang out all night. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, remember?  It was always a party at Diane's apartment.  It was always a party at my house.  Who used to...  Who's the one that gave the hummers at the end of the night?  Nobody.  Nobody.  Nobody.  There was no hummers.  We went to the grass-growing races.  It was me and her.  It was great.  They put the seeds down water and we...  No, it was me and her and another friend of ours and other people that we knew.  It was nobody.  It was a few friends of ours.  No picking up people, no...  You didn't get free?  No.  No getting free.  All right, ladies, ladies.  Which one of you farted?  Neither.  It was cigars.  Neither one of us.  No, you got to fess up. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Nobody.  Who farted then?  Because actually, I still smelled it because I think it's still in one of your pants.  No, we did not.  Who farted then?  Nobody.  Who do you think farted if it wasn't you two?  Rachel said it was cigars.  No, it wasn't cigars.  No, it's not cigars.  I don't know.  Don't...  We don't know.  We don't know.  Turtle races.  Turtle races.  That was your wild night out?  You're talking, that was yin-yang party.  Every other Friday.  Yin-yang party.  Let's go to the turtle races. 
[02:33:00]  We used to go and hang out at this bar that we...  I grew up around a block.  Right.  We used to go in there and just hang out there until o'clock.  I need...  Marion, later die.  Listen, I need pictures of you guys back in your heyday, a yin-yang party.  Bring them in.  And please, because we need to have some of those...  I know you have some.  ...up on a website.  He has.  What are you, crazy?  You bring those in.  I got to see the young...  I don't have that.  ...retarded Laverne and Shirley...  ...out-fawcett hairdo.  ...yin-yang party with Farrah Fawcett hairdo. 
[02:33:30]  We were...  We were...  I was...  I was much thinner back then.  He was much thinner.  You know what's funny about that, Anthony?  What's up?  You know when there's always, like, a hairstyle that gets popular, like, you know, the Farrah Fawcett...  Uh-huh.  ...or the Dorothy Hamill.  You know, those haircuts aren't meant for everyone.  Right, right.  At one time.  So, ladies, I had the Farrah Fawcett, but I went with the, uh, the Bo-Derek 10, uh, beads.  I never had beads in my hair.  You never had beads?  I had beads in my hair.  Oh, you had the 10?  And what did you have?  The big...  The feathered...  Did you have the feathered cut that you would blow-dry back? 
[02:34:00]  No.  Like the Farrah Fawcett?  No, I would blow-dry my hair.  I did that one time.  My hair is natural.  They talk at the same time.  I know, they talk at the same time.  No, wait for her to finish.  Because you're asking her, and then you're asking me.  Mary went with the Rocky Dennis.  All right, you go first, and then I'll go second.  Okay?  All right, first, what you were saying.  In other words, just, we want more info on your wacky night out, but it seems like that's  all you got.  You don't recall a night of maybe some sex in a car or something? 
[02:34:30]  Oh, Marion just went, um, yeah?  A little car sex, Marion?  No.  Oh, not that.  Not that.  Yeah.  Not that.  A handy?  No, nothing.  You give the guy the handy?  No, no, it was not like that.  That's a Boeing 707.  Those babies really hugged the sky.  Come on, animal house.  No, I was thinking about other stuff.  There goes the bell.  I was thinking about other stuff.  Yeah, I always wondered what, uh, Rocky Dennis would look like with a perm, and now I know. 
[02:35:00]  We were thinking, I was thinking about other stuff that we did.  I got sleep sitting up.  What were you smoking?  Come on, say it.  What were you smoking?  Yeah, a little man.  Like, nobody ever smoked a joint when they were younger.  Oh, so now you're out partying, you smoke a little weed out in the car?  Yeah.  And then what happened?  Years ago.  Then what happened?  Don't forget, this is going back 13, 14, 13 years ago.  This is like crazy, right?  So you'd smoke a little pot. 
[02:35:30]  Were you with guys at the time?  You're just with each other?  Yeah, and other friends.  Friends, but with some of the friends guys?  Yeah.  All right, so you'd smoke some pot, and then what?  Would they try to pick you up sometimes?  No.  That would make you horny.  I don't know what kind of weed these were smoking.  Yeah.  Hey, ladies, can we do our own turtle races?  Where we put you, you know, put you on your back.  You can see how long it takes you to stay in the gas station.  Get them turtle suits and have them run around the block.  They don't need the shells. 
[02:36:00]  There was a DJ there.  At least announcing.  There was a DJ there who had their own turtles.  Big whoop, who cares?  He was from actually, from down the street.  I'm getting reports that you went with the Pat Benatar hairdo.  Is that true?  You went with the Pat Benatar?  No.  I did.  No?  One time.  You went with everything.  I must have had all different hairstyles.  My hair was blonde one time, too.  Oh, my God.  She did.  She dyed her hair blonde one time.  That's right.  Wow, that's hot.  That's why your hair dyed.  That's why your hair dyed. 
[02:36:30]  My hair did not dye.  All right, so you're smoking some pot.  You're out in the car.  What else?  What's the wildest night?  You two, I know you probably got a story about, remember that night?  Give us some insight.  We ended up staying over here in Manhattan at a video place.  Oh, he's talking about years ago.  Years ago.  Oh, we did that, too.  Okay.  We used to hang out.  All right, so you came into Manhattan.  You had to stay overnight at a video place for what?  No, we just hung out.  We went to a movie.  You went to a movie.  We missed the last train. 
[02:37:00]  And that's...  We went back to Jersey, and we just figured, what the hell, we got three hours, we walked  around here, we went in.  We ended up in a video place.  Ying, yang, party!  We went to a porn theater.  The Midnight Show.  We went to a porno movie.  All right, now we're getting somewhere.  What was the name of the porno movie?  I don't remember.  Was it...  No, because...  And it was a film.  You went in, it was a theater, and you watched a porno movie.  What was going on in the film?  Yeah, what was happening?  What was going on in the film?  Oh, yeah, you remember it. 
[02:37:30]  I remember that.  You remember being...  Saying, hey, that's Saran Wrap.  Saran Wrap.  What was...  Some girls were wrapping up this guy with Saran Wrap and having their way with him.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know the name of the...  And that's your wildest night out.  Not our wildest.  It was a night out over here in New York.  We had a couple wildest.  I was saying, I'm looking for the wild night of sex, drugs, and hijinks.  I want to know when Marion decided to look like a Dr. Seuss character.  Oh, there we go.  Which one she looked like, Kofi?  Which one?  I don't know.  It's killing me, though.  I don't know when I decided to look like fire tux. 
[02:38:00]  Someone's got to...  We have pictures of Marion on the website.  Someone's got to find the Dr. Seuss character she looks like.  Oh, that's a good contest.  What Dr. Seuss character are we talking about?  What do I look like?  Who?  Huh?  Which one?  I don't know.  No, it's not a who.  No, definitely not a who.  I don't know who.  Which Dr. Seuss character?  Back then, I had long straight hair.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  When you guys met me last year, I had long straight hair.  Oh, you didn't even know.  I don't remember.  Wow.  I remember when you had long hair. 
[02:38:30]  I got the perm for the summer.  You got the perm for the summer.  Hey, Marion.  The perm gets cut out.  Marion, you could rest your arms on your boobs.  She was just doing that.  Wow.  I could do that, too.  I could do that, too.  Lady Donna's got to go, I could do it, too.  See?  Hi.  How you been?  Hi, Steve.  Hi.  Oh, my gosh.  Everyone that walks in, they're just, hi.  I don't like pictures.  All right.  Ladies, thank you.  We do get out.  Ladies, thank you.  And remember, bring in pictures of you in your partying heyday, your yin-yang party heyday.  I have them.  I have one or two.  I want all of them. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  You'll get them.  Nice.  You will get them.  All right.  There you go.  I was about 40 pounds thinner, too.  Oh, wow.  Hot.  Wow.  So bring those in.  Thank you.  Bring those in.  It was real thin.  All right, ladies.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  For whatever.  When do you want us to bring them in?  ASAP.  Whenever I could find them.  Yeah, of course.  Ladies, bring them in next week.  Thank you.  Next week?  Next Friday.  Thank you.  Next Friday.  How about in August?  No, ladies.  August.  Ladies leave.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  Thank you, girls.  Thank you.  Thank you for leaving.  Of course you will.  Thank you for leaving.  Okay.  Please.  Take care.  Bye, guys.  Bye-bye.  Bye, retarded Laverne and Shirley.  There they go.  Green eggs in hand.  Ying Yang party.  Woo!  Ying Yang party, Stinky.  Woo!  We're going to the turtle races.  Ying Yang party!  Stinky!  Ying Yang party, baby!  Stinky!  Ying Yang party!  Stinky!  Ying Yang party!  Ying Yang party!  Woo!  Woo!  We're going to the turtle races.  Woo! 
[02:40:00]  We had to say that.  We had to say that.  Oh, my God.  Turtle races.  Rocky Dennis with a perm.  Holy smoke.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to take a break here.  Is it the mayor of Whoville?  Huh?  It's not the mayor of Whoville, is it?  It's killing me.  I don't know.  Paul Mercurio.  Hey.  From the Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Hi, guys.  Sorry you had to sit through that, Paul.  That's right.  I could smell the fart from here.  The fart was really bad.  Awful.  One of the worst ones I've ever smelled.  It's like having Alice Cramden and Trixie in the studio. 
[02:40:30]  Jesus.  They talk at the same time.  Oh, my God.  How's it going?  Not as well as you, my friend.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  We got nominated for two Emmys for Best Show, Variety Show, Comedy Show, and Best Writing.  And, Anthony, you'll enjoy this.  Also, I got nominated Best Stand-Up Comic.  Like, everybody step to the back of the line, please.  Please come up and accept the Emmy for Best. 
[02:41:00]  Did John get nominated?  John, as a host, did not get nominated.  Oh, thank God.  No, let me tell you, because it's going to be bad enough to deal with him being the host of the Emmy Award-winning Daily Show.  But if he was nominated, he'd be out of hand.  He does tend to get a little full of himself when things happen.  Oh, yes.  Like when he was hosting, what did he host?  The Grammys.  The Grammys.  Yeah.  Right after that, a little full of himself.  I think he's gotten back down to earth now, and I like that. 
[02:41:30]  He is.  All five foot two of them is back down to earth.  Right.  Now, if you start piling up Emmys on this guy, I'm afraid it'll just, you know, it'll get a little out of hand again.  Hey, by the way, I went to Bar 9, and I saw Mr. Anthony there and his brother playing a little bit of the music.  Very nice.  Oh, that's right.  You were down there.  Very talented, Opie.  That's a lot of fun.  Nobody covers Weird Al Yankovic like these guys. 
[02:42:00]  Like, I thought he was in the room.  Seriously.  You know something?  I think that's one artist we actually skipped that night.  Every other crap thing we did.  And, of course, they've got their freaky kind of, they're nice, but they're a little, like your groupies that follow you around there.  Ah, yes.  They show up every Tuesday.  Yeah.  And so should you.  They have, yeah, no, it's actually fun.  And all the groupies have their eyes sewn completely open all the time.  Right.  They don't blink.  It's just kind of weird.  Well, Paul, congratulations. 
[02:42:30]  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for taking the time to have me on.  You're coming in next week, right?  I am, yeah, I think Tuesday.  Nice.  Yes.  All right, man.  All right, brother, man.  Keep that John grounded.  Take it easy, Paul.  I'll tell you later.  Bye.  All right.  We have to take a quick break and play.  Jing and party.  And play, what did we learn on the O&A show today?  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  O&A's road, baby.  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah, sure. 
[02:43:00]  Bud Light.  Ah, Bud Light.  When you want a light beer that tastes like real beer, you've got to make it a Bud Light.  I drink it.  I love it.  Because it doesn't taste like you're drinking a Bud Light.  Just last night, somebody offered me a light beer, and it was another type of light beer.  The one in the silver can.  And I've got to tell you, it's like water. 
[02:43:30]  It's like water that's been filtered through a human's kidneys.  I can't say the word, but I think you get the message.  You want a beer, like, it tastes like Budweiser.  It does.  You can do a side-by-side taste test.  Go ahead.  Do it now.  I'll wait.  There, see?  Bud Light tastes like Bud.  Don't be fooled by imitations.  You can't be.  When you're drinking a Bud Light, you think you're drinking Bud.  And that right there is the biggest compliment you could ever give Bud Light.  So you're at the beach or the ballpark, whatever.  Make it a Bud Light. 
[02:44:00]  The great taste that won't fill you up and never lets you down.  Bud Light.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturdays, 11 to 3.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, huh?  877-692-1027.  What a day.  What a day. 
[02:44:30]  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Time to play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Let's start with Martin.  Hey, Martin.  What's up?  Hey.  How's it going?  You tell us.  All right.  You guys talk and swallow.  Have a nice day.  All right, Martin.  Bye-bye.  And that probably won't go through.  That didn't go through?  I don't know.  Let's try Carolyn.  Hey, Carolyn.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  I learned today that there's some men in China with straight pubic hair. 
[02:45:00]  Right.  Hey, that's good.  I thought so.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Have a good weekend.  She paid attention.  Juice, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, what's up?  I learned a couple of things.  I learned stinky appears to actually be a real person.  And I learned teen man boobs, none like sexier.  Oh, poor Juice.  Juice.  Juice, you're coming down to show the man boobs.  Actually, I changed my mind.  I'm not coming down anymore.  Why?  I can't face up to it.  You can't face up to it?  No. 
[02:45:30]  All right, man.  All right, ladies.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Dough boy.  Yo, what's up, boys?  What's up?  I learned that if you want to hang out with a bunch of hot 18-year-olds, all you got to  do is call around.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's easy.  Yin-yang party, boys.  Woo!  Woo!  Yin-yang party.  Sweeping the nation.  Watch, it catches on in Columbus or something.  We're screwed.  Yin-yang party.  Yin-yang party.  Woo!  Bang! 
[02:46:00]  Rick, what's outside?  Party call of the retarded.  Remember when Lexi called because she wanted to meet Brian Regan?  Oh, yeah.  Did she get to meet him?  Lexi is a fine African princess.  And, Rick, what does Lexi want to do?  Remember what happened last time you said that, Ophie?  Yeah, I do remember.  It was a man, baby.  She was saying how it was great to meet Brian and that she didn't have to take off her top  to do it.  Right.  But she's going to have to do it in here, though.  Oh, really?  Oh. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, okay.  Well, that's always good.  It's a good way to end the show.  And Pooter Toot says he learned that when you go to the planetarium, look for the Andromeda  stream.  It's right up there.  Hi, Lexi.  Hi.  Did you have fun today?  I did.  I was excited to meet Brian.  Isn't he funny?  Yes.  Yeah, he's great.  I went to Boston to visit my friends at MIT, and we spent about three hours in a dorm room  just downloading all sorts of crap, all of his bits.  Yeah.  Funny guy.  O.D., you feeling that? 
[02:47:00]  She's an educated black woman.  How tall are you?  I don't know.  I stopped recording it because guys would always ask me on the train, and I got annoyed.  Yeah, but you're like...  I just have no idea.  She's a smooth 6'1".  I was going to say 6'1".  She's a smooth 6'1".  6'1 with a big top, yo.  I don't know.  What's up with that?  You know what I'm saying?  You're the ghetto.  Ying, yi.  Yeah, Opie's ghetto.  Opie's ghetto.  Opie's ghetto.  Opie teaches me.  You just start mumbling.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:47:30]  I learned that on the train.  I got it, man.  You just kind of...  You know what you're going to say.  That's why I don't tell people my height.  What?  I can't follow you.  Hi.  Hi.  What's the deal, sugar?  I should teach them some black history.  No, man.  We got to get out of here.  My hooptie's waiting for me downstairs. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, it's Friday.  Got to get it.  Got to get it.  Get out of here.  What?  Opie's ghetto is a matzo.  Please.  Old Dirty, give me some...  I'm from matzo country.  Old Dirty, give me some cheddar.  I got to eat tonight, yo.  Okay, my brother.  Yeah.  You got to get some pain right there.  Yeah, I'm feeling it.  I'm feeling it.  I'm feeling it.  Is that the name Voss, I think it is?  Rich Voss.  Oh, my God.  I saw him at...  Hey, the black chick digs me. 
[02:48:30]  No.  He actually...  I was with my friend Joe.  We're Jerry.  Hi, Joe.  And we were sitting there, and he...  We're not dating or whatever, but he picks us out, and he goes,  Hey, you meet your parents yet?  And he's like, What?  Yeah, you.  Did you meet your parents?  He's like, No.  And he's like, Yeah, I would hide you from my parents, too.  Now, my friend Joe is not a scary-looking guy, and I was a little insulted.  Yeah.  Can we see your boobs?  Oh, that's false.  Wow.  I don't think so.  I want a yin-yang party, yo.  Yin-yang party.  What is the yin-yang party?  I don't know.  Well, you got the yin and the yang.  Two retarded women out front said that.  And we got the pate. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, really?  It's a cotton blouse, yeah.  Oh, really?  All right, how about a bra shot?  How about the bra shot, yo?  Come on, you can flip the Abercrombie up real quick.  I'm not in the catalog.  If I was in the catalog, maybe.  She speaks real good, son.  Well, what are you amazed at that for, O.D.?  I don't know.  Jesus, are you inappropriate.  I mean, all right, you can read the bathroom.  Wait, how did you expect me to speak, O.D.?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I thought you was going to be a little bit more, you know... 
[02:49:30]  Under welfare.  Why?  Yo, no.  Oh, my God.  I can't...  Well, what does he mean by that, yo?  Well, you know, I thought you was going to be a little bit more and more thuggish in your...  Thuggish?  Thuggish.  He's wearing an Abercrombie and Fitch shirt.  In the essence of your speech.  Anthony, I learned today the Chinese have officially apologized for coming up with the concept of yin and yang.  Al Mack, today I learned ONA listeners voted them even more gooder.  Yes, thank you very much, guys.  We're more gooder. 
[02:50:00]  We're more gooder according to the little ratings thing that came out.  You don't have to do anything Rick's trying to make you do.  No, we don't force the ladies.  There's plenty that will do that for us.  Jerry learned, if you don't get braces, you'll lisp.  The big stupid one is Lady Di, and contrary to popular belief, a fart is not always funny.  Yes, that's true.  Lieutenant Boogaloo, I learned on today's show that you can start oral on the radio, but you can't finish.  And I learned out on 57th Street there's this big blue thing.  That's right. 
[02:50:30]  And Haywood from Yonkers, I learned your radio station sucks if you get beat by a classic rock station.  We got a booger.  We got to bo...  I'll see you Monday, man.  Yeah, thank you, everyone.  We greatly appreciate the support of the radio show.  Brian Regan, tonight and tomorrow, Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  We highly recommend you go see Brian.  Two shows, both nights, okay?  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes, but don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:51:00]  I like it when this show's dirty. </pre>
