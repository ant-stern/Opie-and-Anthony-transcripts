<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a critique of their intro music, deemed insufficiently "tavern-like," followed by a discussion of their declining New York ratings. They blamed this partly on 9/11 and mocked a conservative talk radio station, its program director, and the deceased Bob Grant with disparaging remarks.  They then speculated about inflated Arbitron ratings for WBLS, an urban contemporary station, leading into a highly offensive and racially charged discussion about Black music, culminating in the playing of a *Blazing Saddles* clip in response to a listener's request for a "nigger work song."

The conversation shifted to Michael Jordan's divorce, with Opie and Anthony employing highly misogynistic and offensive language to criticize Juanita Jordan and her legal pursuit of his assets. This devolved into extended offensive commentary on divorce, women, and lawyers.  Listener calls ensued, one about a wrestling match leading to a discussion of a "virginity contest" segment. A participant withdrew due to parental objections after her family learned of her involvement through the show.  The hosts attempted to contact her, then moved on to other callers, including one interested in a different sex-themed segment.  The segment ended with the hosts searching for a replacement for the "virginity contest" participant, ultimately leading to her discovery and subsequent firing from her job after the hosts revealed her place of employment.

Bubba Ray Dudley of the WWF was then introduced as a guest. A suggestive phone call from Danielle preceded discussions of Bubba Ray's intimidating presence, comparisons to other wrestlers (including graphic descriptions of Triple H's physique), and anecdotes about wrestling incidents.  Numerous WWF references, including Triple H's return, Ric Flair's bleeding, and the "what? what? what?" chant, were interwoven throughout. Bubba Ray shared stories of fan interactions, particularly a recurring joke about a "white string" on women's underwear, which often involved audience participation. A caller insulted Bubba Ray, resulting in a challenge to a station confrontation, accepted by Bubba Ray with a $500 and tickets offer.  Further calls included an arm-wrestling challenge and an in-person confrontation leading to a brief physical altercation in the studio.  The hosts also discussed a listener's potential "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge" participation, a book promotion, and WWF events,  interspersed with frequent vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.

The next segment began with a video of Crazy Paul being forcibly brought into the studio by Bubba Ray Dudley, sparking speculation about Bubba Ray's potential targets. A caller, Mark, arranged for his girlfriend, Cindy (24), and possibly a friend to participate in the "Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge."  This was followed by a bizarre interview with a self-proclaimed "osteopathic physician," Dr. Smith, promoting "Golden Mood."  The interview was antagonistic and offensive, filled with inappropriate jokes and canned laughter. Dr. Smith's claims were challenged and ridiculed, and he revealed his mother died from over-medication.  It was later revealed Dr. Smith was a plant.  The focus returned to the "Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge," with Daniela and a male friend participating.  Daniela received blows to her buttocks, prompting graphic commentary and laughter from the hosts.  She won SmackDown tickets.  Further discussion included a planned "smell contest" and a caller's mention of a Croc Hunter/Mike Tyson reference, generating more off-color commentary.  A discussion between Daniela and her friend about sexual encounters and inducing an abortion in a young woman also took place.

The final segment featured in-studio guests Danielle and a "Chinese guy," with off-color jokes surrounding their departure. A recurring bit involved inventing and reading fake Associated Press (AP) news stories containing outrageous and offensive claims about the hosts and guests, including accusations of sexual misconduct and violence.  This included fabricated stories about a Big Brother contestant, Michael Jordan's divorce, and sexually explicit claims about the show's personnel.  A 12-year-old caller, Gary, and his father celebrated Gary's birthday on-air amidst the "AP" stories.  The death of Dave Thomas and Michael Jordan's divorce were also discussed, alongside a man imprisoned for seven years for contempt of court in a divorce case. The show concluded with a song summarizing its offensive content, listing various slurs and topics.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Radio Tavern.  Did you fart already? We've been on the air for 30 seconds.  Yes, he did. He did.  I did not.  Dude, it's not even funny anymore.  I didn't. It's not even funny.  You know what he says? He says he went outside, but he didn't do the rules.  The rules are, you blast one outside, you've got to stand there, pat it out of your pants,  walk around and defuse it, and then come back in here without it trailing you. 
[00:00:30]  We are Tavern Radio with you farting like this.  Tavern.  Awful!  What is that, Tavern?  How are we supposed to get respectability with you farting 30 seconds into the show every day?  That's why they call it a poopy show.  Who calls it that?  I think I just did.  Well, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow. 
[00:01:00]  Dude, come on.  Isn't that awful?  It came in with you.  It follows you in.  You ate something and it died in your midsection somewhere,  and now those fumes are just coming out of you.  Do you realize how bad that stinks?  Oh, Tavern Radio.  There it is.  A little more sounds from Tavern.  Is that it?  Oh, slide me down a drink. 
[00:01:30]  On this Tavern Radio.  Who wrote that?  Oh, I did a drink.  Who wrote that, by the way?  This is the best you guys can come up with for bar noise?  This is like a, this is an airport terminal, I think.  Yeah.  That's not like hanging out at a bar.  That's not bar noise.  This isn't Tavern Sounds.  How are we supposed to do our Tavern Radio bit with that?  What does it say on there? 
[00:02:00]  Medium crowd.  Medium crowd.  Stinky stinks.  Ooh.  Stinky stinks.  What's wrong with it?  It sounds like a bar.  That doesn't sound like a bar.  Maybe after 15, maybe after 15 joints bars sound like that.  Yeah, what track?  What track was that?  One.  One.  One.  Hey, kids, does this sound like a bar you've been in before?  It's the old grandpa bar next to the OTB.  It's a tavern. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, it's a tavern, not a bar.  That's not a tavern?  Tavern.  Tavern?  That's a tavern.  All right, go to two.  Let's see if two's better.  That's like a restaurant.  I don't know what that is.  A horse track.  Carnegie.  Carnegie.  Yeah.  Why are we supposed to do the tavern radio bit without the proper sound effects?  I don't know.  Holy ass.  Yeah, a lot of people making fun of Ant and I today. 
[00:03:00]  Just like we told you, the papers would acknowledge the fact that we slipped in the ratings here in New York.  Oh, boy.  Even though we're doing really well still with what matters to us, which is the male demos.  Yeah.  But then you got the program director of the conservative talk station in town.  This is what he says about us.  And WNEW isn't designed to talk about something serious.  Yes.  That's tavern talk over there.  Tavern talk.  And then it says, the tavern emptied somewhat between summer and fall as NEW dropped from 22nd place to 24th place. 
[00:03:30]  While Rowdy and Raunchy Opie and Anthony slid from 4th to 8th in the overall ratings.  Barkeep.  Barkeep.  All right.  This is a better tavern sound effect.  What the hell is that?  That's Happy New Year.  What the hell is that?  That's a tavern.  Somebody in a wheelchair.  No, wait, wait.  Know what that is?  That old urban legend where there's a surprise birthday party, but the girl's getting, you know, 
[00:04:00]  all the peanut butter.  Because she's naked and there's peanut butter on her.  Right.  This is the sound you hear from the crowd as they see her on the floor.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  The dog's licking the peanut butter.  I guess she wasn't expecting us.  What?  I think she said, look at the blanks on her.  I kind of heard that in there.  Try this. 
[00:04:30]  We're going to spend the first ten minutes of the show getting the proper sound effect.  That ain't it.  You know, Voss wasn't performing.  Shut up, you poor guy.  We're five minutes into the show.  You farted and you made fun of Ridge Voss.  So, anyway, they're laughing pretty good across town at the conservative talk station  calling us Tavern Talk Radio.  Tavern Talk.  It took the whole world falling completely apart for them to beat us in the ratings. 
[00:05:00]  So, congratulations.  Enjoy your victory.  Well, alas, you ass wipes.  Same station that fired the great Bob Grant.  Bob Grant, let me tell you something.  I got fired for my comments about that washroom attendant mayor we had  and the colored gentleman that crashed in the airplane.  Swachim.  You skeebo, sir.  Yeah, he was great in his day, man. 
[00:05:30]  Best.  They tamed him down.  And I guess all the talk show hosts over there at ABC.  Everyone's very happy.  They're happy and they're making fun of you and I.  I don't know.  But it took the whole world to fall apart to beat us.  So, congratulations.  People aren't putting things in the proper context, you know?  People's habits kind of changed a little bit over the past three months.  And believe me, we'll get back to...  If you need to be suckled by conservative radio talk show hosts, then so be it.  Go have fun.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I personally could think for myself, and I don't need to hear a bunch of windbags tell 
[00:06:00]  me, you know, what this means to me on the radio.  And the alleged criminal activity at BLS here in New York.  You got to explain that for the rest of the country.  Oh, my God.  There is controversy.  A-brewing.  I don't know if this will affect us in the end, but who knows?  There's a station in New York.  Earl knows everything about it because he likes to think of himself as a black man.  It's WBLS.  Right.  They play... 
[00:06:30]  Who are their artists?  Usher, I guess they would play.  Baby Face.  Baby Face.  You've got a station like this in your city.  It's called crap.  What is the format?  Urban Contemporary.  Urban Contemporary.  Black music.  They play.  That's predominant.  Well, there you go.  There you go, Jed.  Black artist for black people.  Right?  That's what it is.  It's like urban contemporary.  Not your heavy hip-hop or nothing.  Just all that nice music.  Right.  And they went out of nowhere through the goddamn room. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, we got one of their songs?  All right.  Here's one of the songs you'd hear on there.  Say it's never seen it.  Master got me working.  Someday master set me free.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Earl.  I don't know how that got on, but...  All right.  Give me your...  Hey, do we have someone on the request line requesting a song from WBLS over there?  This must be wine.  That's what I thought.  Okay. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Actually, it's the DJ taking out another CD.  Okay.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  No, actually, Anthony, I got a request.  Do you?  Yeah.  They're calling the wrong station.  Calling.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Holy Jesus Christ.  Why would Blazing Saddles clips be being played on that station?  Stop it.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:08:00]  Puzzah!  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  Earl, stop!  All right.  Hey, you're on your own, Pally.  No.  I didn't push any buttons.  Anyway.  So, didn't somebody call up and ask if they could borrow one of the records from that station?  Really?  Yeah, I think they did.  I don't know.  I could have sworn they did. 
[00:08:30]  Really?  I'm looking at all my clips over here.  I can't imagine which one you want me to play.  Huh.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Me either.  No clue.  Yeah, neither do I.  All right.  So, the controversy with this...  Oh, isn't that on my sheet, Rick?  What is it?  Which one?  No, my brother.  Oh.  Ass?  Oh, we got that.  Wait, it should be on mine.  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Great.  There you go.  It's so effective.  So, what's the controversy? 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  I'm reading on the Mecca of all radio message boards.  Jesus Christ.  The New York radio message board here.  Let me read from the writings of the head of the message board, Alan Sniffen, radio dentist.  What's the matter?  What?  He is.  He's a dentist.  He's very into radio.  The guy's awful.  And he's an armchair quarterback. 
[00:09:30]  He has no idea how this business works.  He was in radio, Opie.  But he has his followers that listen to every word he says.  Why would you want to know what a dentist is?  I can point out 20 times he's been wrong about our show alone.  Come on.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Here's what Alan writes on the New York radio message board.  Got this from a good source, but treat it as a rumor for now, he says.  Beltsville going to reissue some of the New York book due to a misguided key entry that was favorable for BLS. 
[00:10:00]  They may not have done as well as we thought when the recount is done.  So I guess the people that do the ratings are going to look over.  It's always strange when a radio station that just plays music all of a sudden goes through the roof in a radio.  Through the roof.  For no apparent reason.  I mean, if you follow the logic, that just means, okay, a whole bunch of people just decided they like black music.  Right.  Out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere.  All of a sudden, a bunch of people enjoy black music. 
[00:10:30]  Now, to follow this logic, now, when there's a world-changing event like what happened on 9-11, you could see where things would jump, obviously.  The news stations?  The news stations.  Through the goddamn roof.  Conservative talk because there's a bunch of pussy listeners out there that need to be suckled and told what this means to them.  That's all right.  It all turns back around is what it does.  It comes back around.  Everyone feels a little more like themselves and falls back into their normal life and existence. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  But for them to take that jump, that BLS, out of nowhere like that, huge.  Huge.  And that has nothing to do with an eye.  We're not talking.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  We're not trying over spilled milk here.  No.  That is just a weird thing that has happened, and we'll see how it plays out.  No, because if this station, picture N.E.W., out of nowhere, going from the 1-3 all the way up to, like, a 3.  But wouldn't people go, hey, wait a minute, what the hell happened? 
[00:11:30]  That can't be right.  Exactly.  Right.  So, let's go to the phones.  David, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Yeah.  I wanted to show that everybody knows your name.  Oh, I get it.  A cheers reference.  Well, yeah, because of, yeah, we're being called Tavern Talk.  Tavern Radio, everybody.  Who uses the word Tavern in the year 2002? 
[00:12:00]  Do you go to a tavern?  When you say bar or strip club.  Pub, even.  Dive bar.  Tavern.  Gin mill.  If the guy that runs a radio station has the word Tavern in his vocabulary, trust me, that's not a station I want to listen to.  I went to the Tavern last night.  So.  Saw some of my old war buddies at the Tavern.  All right, David, yeah, it's the O&A show where everybody knows your name.  Yeah.  Very good.  Very good.  Cheers reference. 
[00:12:30]  Wonderful.  Native.  All right.  Let's go to JP.  JP, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, dude.  Hey, man.  This bitch, right, on WBLS, was bragging yesterday about her ratings.  She's the queen of radio now.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I, let me, let me ask you a few questions and then you answer for me because I really don't know, okay?  Go ahead.  Wendy Williams from WBLS.  WBLS, bragging about her ratings, right?  Right.  All right.  Does she play music? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Actually, she plays music, but she talks more.  She's a big blabbermouth.  How many songs an hour does she play?  Would you guess?  Uh, maybe three or four?  She's got to be playing more than three or four.  Yeah, dude, man.  I mean, let me tell you something.  I'm a diva.  Yo.  It wrecks my whole argument, but I think she plays more than that, right?  Nah, dude.  She's going to stay up there in the ratings, man.  Everybody's listening to her.  She's a big gossip queen, you know?  She's always said of the artist's lives.  She ain't.  Uh-huh.  JP, she ain't crap. 
[00:13:30]  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  She's not even compared to you guys, but.  We'll prove that.  We'll prove that and many other things in the coming months.  Trust me.  She wants her own talk show.  She wants to be like ONA, you know?  Uh-huh.  And now the hit, the station's motto is, well, hip-hop and R&B connect.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Uh-huh.  Let me tell you something.  I don't care.  I look good.  You know what I mean?  I don't care what people say.  I look good.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh. 
[00:14:00]  I don't know about that.  I know that I'll be switching on.  Stay tuned.  All right, JP.  Thank you.  Holla.  A lot of people having fun with our little slide, though.  Enjoy it.  There you go.  It took two planes crashing into two of the largest buildings in the universe for you to beat us,  but enjoy the victory.  I'm sure that's going to happen every three months to keep you in that position, you tools.  Yeah.  All right.  A lot of fun.  Well, at least we're not Michael Jordan. 
[00:14:30]  We're going to suck right into that right off the bat.  I don't know.  I thought we were going to go into the hockey fights first.  That's been on my mind.  We can talk about it later if you want.  Talk about the hockey fights that we were watching.  You brought it up.  Go with it.  God damn it.  Go with it.  Yeah, everyone knows right now.  Son of a bitch.  I understand that no matter what happens with Michael Jordan's life, he's getting a divorce.  They've filed for divorce. 
[00:15:00]  Irreconcilable differences.  And I realize no matter what happens, believe me, Michael Jordan ain't going to be on the streets.  The guy's going to do very, very well for the rest of his born days.  That's it.  He would rather have that money to gamble, though.  Right.  The half he's given up.  He loves his gambling.  You can take 90% of his money and throw it in the toilet, and he'll still be a very, very wealthy man.  Put it that way.  But.  But! 
[00:15:30]  You do not want to hand it over to some slimy, sea-rag bitch that did nothing to earn that money.  Nothing.  She sucked it.  She sucked it.  And now that entitles her.  Here's what the wife wants.  Juanita.  Here's what she wants.  She wants the three kids, custody of the kids, which, you know, I don't give a crap about these goddamn custody cases. 
[00:16:00]  Doesn't matter to me.  I don't know who the better parent is, so I stay out of that whole thing.  She wants the house.  The whole house.  Did you see this house?  Huge.  It's Michael Jordan's house.  It's got to be giant.  And half of all property.  Half, Eddie!  That means one thing.  What?  Jordan got caught playing the blonde roulette.  Oh, you think so?  Oh, hell yeah.  Got caught with one of the many ladies in the many cities, maybe? 
[00:16:30]  He got caught playing the blonde roulette wheel.  Definitely.  You know something?  She's going for the jugular.  And you money-grubbing twats out there that have done this to men can call up and talk about how she was there for him and support.  I ain't buying it.  Unless she laces up some sneakers and starts scoring some friggin' points out on the court.  She deserves, well, not to starve. 
[00:17:00]  If she raised his kids, fine.  What would you pay a friggin' nanny?  You know?  You want to put her up in a house so she could raise the kids, right?  That's fine.  That's fine.  Half the money he earned as a legend in basketball.  Oh, basketball.  So we're still talking about Michael Jordan.  Okay.  Basketball, radio, whatever the hell you want to, whatever subject you want to make it.  Basketball, radio, anything. 
[00:17:30]  Is Jordan's wife's lawyer buying big boats?  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Just trying to get all the facts of this story out there.  Is it?  Is he?  I don't know what why the one he does.  You know what it amounts to?  You whores.  It's prostitution.  It's prostitution.  Mm-hmm.  Plain and simple.  Open the meat curtains.  Ooh.  Mike's coming home. 
[00:18:00]  And that cha-ching entitles you to some cash.  You filthy whore.  It's different than prostitution because prostitutes don't nag and cook meatloaf incorrectly.  And after you bang them and pay them, they don't come rapping on your door for more later.  That's right.  Talking about how they supported your yam bag during the F-Fest.  It doesn't make sense.  It's never made sense.  They want it both ways. 
[00:18:30]  They want the liberation.  They want to be able to go into these corporations and be treated like the man.  They don't want the glass ceilings as far as the pay goes, which, as far as I'm concerned, fine.  Take it all.  Have all your dreams as far as being successful in this country.  Bravo.  More power to you.  But then on the other side of that, don't expect the sugar daddy to be paying half of his earnings to you, you bitch. 
[00:19:00]  Talking about Jordan, right?  Who?  Oh, Michael Jordan.  Yes, Michael Jordan.  That poor son of a bitch, Michael Jordan.  Yeah.  It makes me sick.  Makes me sick.  You know that Jordan's only getting a dollar to play basketball this year?  Oh, really?  So does she get 50 cents?  You know something?  No, let me tell you what her scumbag lawyer will do.  Yeah, he's only being paid a dollar. 
[00:19:30]  But you know what that amounts to in endorsements?  And you know what the team, does he have an interest in the team?  Yeah, that amounts to, so his value as blah, blah, blah, take a bullet in the head.  Damn lawyers, they should all be lined up and just shot, riddled with bullets.  Jordans.  Yeah.  Who do you think I'm talking about?  I'm just making sure you're talking about Michael Jordan.  I hate lawyers.  Whatever you call it, marriage is a 50% partnership, a legal contract. 
[00:20:00]  Don't want to split your money?  Don't get married.  Amen, Ball Sack Teabagger from New York City.  Nice name.  Amen to that.  Let's go to Brother Joe.  Brother Joe.  I agree 100%.  They're all twats.  Right.  Poor Joe.  And you know what's worse?  What?  What's worse?  I mean, okay, Michael, that's one case.  Even you, Ant, that's another case.  What about a poor 10-knocker on the street because his wife gets everything? 
[00:20:30]  Everything.  You're talking about Michael Jordan?  I'm talking about the way Michael Jordan would feel about his poor 10-knocking friends.  Exactly.  But I'm talking about, I mean, a guy after going through a divorce proceeding or prior to going through the settlement process has to give it all up.  Let me tell you something.  It gets no easier.  If you're a 10-knocker or you're Michael Jordan, believe me, it doesn't.  I understand your point there, Ant, but I'm talking about a Michael Jordan giving up half is a really nice lifestyle. 
[00:21:00]  He still has plenty of, I know, it doesn't, let me tell you something.  It does not make it any easier to dish it over to someone you hate.  Oh, no, no, no, personal feelings, yeah.  As far as personal feelings go, yeah, no, it doesn't.  But life is still considerably easier when you have the dough to do it with.  How do you know Jordan's wife so well, Anthony?  Because I could just tell that she's a bitch.  I could tell Juanita Jordan. 
[00:21:30]  And if you were an electrician and making, you know, whatever, you know, electrician wages, making even union wages.  Yeah.  Did she go out into the field and freeze her ass off?  Right.  While you were earning money so you could bring it home to keep her happy?  They do nothing.  They, in court, they try to make it sound like this huge contribution.  Meanwhile, you're the one getting up.  You're the one going to work.  You're the one coming home with the paycheck.  If you want to divvy up what they're actually doing into a monetary value of time and how much you would charge someone to come in and perform those duties, fine. 
[00:22:00]  Minimal wage.  Minimal wage.  But when they start sapping off of 50% of Michael Jordan's money, that guy went out there and bust his hump on the court.  She wasn't there.  She was living the life, you know, getting all the perks for it.  How do you know so much about Jordan's wife?  I just know.  I know Jordan. 
[00:22:30]  I know Jordan.  I know Jordan's wife, Juanita.  Gene Simmons suddenly doesn't look so stupid, does he?  Gene Simmons, genius.  All those people that thought he was a creep, he's right.  All right.  Ever hear of Air Juanita?  No.  Never heard of it.  Twat bag.  All right, Joe.  All right.  I would say that she is a C and she deserves a song played.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe we'll play that going into break.  True.  Later, brother.  All right, man.  Bye.  If the beats weren't so long, we would play it. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Obviously, the phones are lit about Michael Jordan's divorce because a lot of people could  relate to that.  This is the type of thing we're going to be talking about in the tavern today.  In the tavern.  We're sitting on our bar stools.  We've got to talk about the virginity contest.  Oh, yeah.  We're having a tough time getting that girl on the phone from yesterday.  Maybe she cut herself.  Either way, she's got to call us to see what's going on today, okay?  Right.  If she's got cold feet, that's cool. 
[00:23:30]  But she's got to call so we can play it out.  Cold feet?  Because we'll find somebody else.  No problem.  And if you don't know what's going on, you better stick around because it's a great,  great radio idea.  Oh, look at that.  Here in the tavern.  Cheryl, we've got to take a break, but what do you got real fast?  You guys are now known as Opie and Dopey.  Oh, that.  That old gag.  Curtis and Lee was, Curtis Lee was said that.  Yeah, that old gag.  You guys, Sean had to be, really beat you bad, and you guys are Opie and Dopey. 
[00:24:00]  Well, yeah, sure.  He beat us for the first time ever, but it took, like, the whole world collapsing for  him to do it.  So, congratulations.  Enjoy it.  I know you guys will be back because you know you have your supporters.  We'll always be there for you.  Enjoy it.  What do you see in the cards?  What do you see?  Are we coming back?  You guys are going to be number one.  What does the next ratings book say?  Call me now for your free reading.  That Curtis Lee was pretty amusing when he's not being shot in a taxi. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, Opie and Dopey.  Boy, that's Curtis.  How about the Toxic twins?  That's a cute one, too.  Oh, that's funny.  More Dopey and Ain't Funny.  We heard them all, you idiot.  You've come up with Opie and Dopey.  Taxi!  Taxi!  You guys are the number one again.  All right, Cheryl.  Bye.  Bye.  Call me now. 
[00:25:00]  Call me now for your free reading.  I think they're just a little jealous over there about all the attention we've gotten  in the last year.  Like calling us tavern talk.  I don't know.  Which was one thing we never used in any of the interviews or anything.  We like to think of ourselves as tavern talk.  That's what we do.  It's a tavern.  Tavern.  Yeah, we'll see how many of those listeners are truly faithful to you.  Here in the saloon.  The inn.  Tavern talk. 
[00:25:30]  Ah.  Well, for a show that stinks, the phones are just cranked.  Well, people are getting very...  So we will take a quick break because we're playing less commercials.  That is a fact.  Which is more gooder.  It is more gooder and we'll get to the phone calls next.  So stay there.  It's going to be an interesting day today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ready?  Three, three, two, one.  Opie and Anthony.  The Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.  Right.  Where he can't leave anything alone.  Let's hear a mother-daughter queef over the phone. 
[00:26:00]  You pick artistic subjects.  Opie and Anthony.  E-W.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for checking us out.  We greatly appreciate it.  Wow.  Ah, Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I was wondering, what do you think of Angle getting his ass kicked last night on Raw by Triple H?  All right, well, Triple H made his return to the WWF last night.  You know what?  I'm kind of pissed off at the WWF. 
[00:26:30]  We got Bubba Ray Dudley coming in today.  Yeah.  Everyone knew that Triple H was coming back yesterday.  Yeah.  He didn't come back until 5 to 11.  Of course not.  It's like listening to your favorite radio show and they tease something for four...  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I thought it was cool.  I mean, the guy, obviously, he's been working out for the last eight months.  Holy S.  I know.  He's built.  He's like the Hulk comes to life.  And, yeah, he beat up Kurt Angle to pretty much end Raw last night. 
[00:27:00]  It was cool.  It was definitely cool to see our friend Triple H back.  So he's been working on his upper body.  Yeah.  Oh, just ridiculous.  Hey, Opie, I'm kind of surprised you watched it last night.  I figured you'd be watching your hockey fights video.  Oh, we saw the hockey fights in the office today.  Oh, my God.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But Triple H, so he goes into the ring with his cut-off jean jacket, long-sleeved shirt.  And he's in the ring for about 10 or 15 minutes and he finally takes his shirt off and stuff.  And my girlfriend goes, finally!  Oh, she was waiting, man. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Made me feel like the biggest douchebag on the planet.  Just make sure your girlfriend don't watch Oz like Anthony.  Hey.  But you know what?  WWF, give us a break.  You could have brought him back right at 10.  First hour, teased the crap out of it.  No one was going anywhere like that.  Say, tease it.  I understand you got to tease to get your ratings up.  Maybe we should do more of that.  But, come on.  5 to 11, he finally shows up.  Or 10 to 11.  By the way, we have a leader in the sign contest. 
[00:28:00]  Yes.  We had a really good sign.  It was on black cardboard, yellow writing.  It said, wow.  Very visible.  O&A, 1027.  It was kind of in the corner the whole night.  That person is leading the contest to go to the Royal Rumble.  You only have one more shot at it tonight at Madison Square Garden when they film SmackDown tonight.  SmackDown.  So, best O&A-related sign will win the trip to the Royal Rumble.  That's what I'm going to get.  They've been to Madison Square Garden a bunch of times, and they've only been to Boston very less. 
[00:28:30]  I think it's because of the 7-Eleven thing.  I mean, 9-Eleven.  The 7-Eleven thing.  Dude, we need to sound more intelligent on this show.  Some people don't say it's tavern talk.  Tavern talk.  It's 9-Eleven.  That's 7-Eleven.  Yeah, 7-Eleven.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye.  A little convenience store into the building.  Hey, Jay, what's going on? 
[00:29:00]  Yo, how you doing?  All right.  Did you bring in the taste for Anthony to watch today?  Yeah, Blood on Ice.  We checked it out before the show today for like an hour straight.  Very nice.  I've got to say, the best fight we saw, come on, Clark Gillies?  Clark Gillies was a monster.  Knocked that guy out.  You got knocked the F out.  He knocked him the F out.  Yeah.  I bet Norton takes back his comment about what he said about Triple H.  I didn't watch wrestling.  What did I say about Triple H?  If Triple H walked through that door, because you were talking all kinds of crap, talking some smack. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, man.  You would be in the corner cowering.  Oh, what?  Like Glenn Close with a big chill in the shower.  Crying.  You'd be in the fetal position in the corner there, crying your eyes out.  All right.  And Norton is good.  What do you think of Bubba Ray Dudley?  I don't know who he is.  Smart.  I really don't.  Good move, because he's coming through that door in about an hour.  I don't care.  You don't care?  No.  I don't know who he is, actually.  Oh, buddy.  I actually don't know who he is.  That guy will kill you.  Dude, don't even challenge Bubba Ray.  Why would I?  He's a wrestler.  That guy, he was in here once, intimidating one of our listeners. 
[00:30:00]  It was intense.  That guy will kill you.  All you have to do is lay a finger on him, and then it's fair game, and then you're done.  And his whole gig is to try to get you to touch him first.  Yeah.  And then you touch him first, and it's fair game, man.  He'll talk.  And he can take out your face.  He'll talk about you like you're the biggest pussy.  Just like, come on, do it.  Do it.  You pussy.  And, you know, then you don't do anything, because he'll kill you.  Exactly.  But if you're stupid enough to do something, then he'll kill you. 
[00:30:30]  He's allowed to do whatever he wants.  You would last a half a second.  No, I wouldn't.  Can Mr. Dudley run?  Because he would have to catch me.  And I have no shame in admitting I would run from a professional wrestler.  He can run.  He can outrun you.  All right.  Then I would drink from his mule.  I would get out of that beating somehow.  Drink from his mule.  So we're looking for more signs tonight at the Garden for the taping of SmackDown.  Right.  Best sign will win the trip to the Royal Rumble.  What happened to the fat virgin? 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  From what I'm hearing, we can't get her on the phone?  Yes, sir.  Left her about four or five messages already at the number she left us.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Well, she's got a call back.  If you've got cold feet, we understand.  But, you know, this show's kind of more like a soap opera, not tavern talk.  And, you know, if you're scared to do it, that's cool.  But let us know so we can move on with our virginity contest.  Yes, Jim?  Working at a pet store like a fat Adrian.  Pick up the phone.  Bring Cuff and Link a little bit of turtle food. 
[00:31:30]  Cuff and Link.  Yeah, I thought maybe we'd go to the zoo and look at the tigers.  Carlos, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I believe I should win the sign thing by default.  I got taken.  When I went to try to get into the National Square Garden, they took my Mr. Lad bag off of me.  I had a big Mr. Lad bag shopping bag over my head, and they took it for me.  I couldn't go in with it.  It said, Mr. Lad bag, ONA 1027.  So you guys got to be smarter, though, man. 
[00:32:00]  They're on to us.  What you do is you have a stupid sign like the rock rocks, and then you bring in a big magic marker and write something else on the back.  No, but they check the bags real good.  I was thinking about bringing in another one, but they check it.  Check the bags.  Do you understand something, my friend?  You make a sign that says something about the rock or Triple H on one side.  You have a black magic marker in your pocket.  You're not going to check your pocket.  And then you write something else and hold that up.  Yeah, I blew it.  Get heroin into jail.  You can get a marker into the garden.  Right.  Same place. 
[00:32:30]  Look what we're doing with airport security.  I think you can get a magic marker into Madison Square Garden tonight.  Maybe next time.  All right, Carlos.  Carlos, here's Jimmy, who is almost going to fight.  Oh.  Jimmy, what's going on, boys?  He's going to get his ass kicked.  You've got to be honest.  You were freaking, right?  Well, it came close, boys.  You know it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know you're going to talk some smack now on the phone.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  I saw the fear in your eyes because we were all feeling the fear.  And you were close to touching him, and I knew it was going to be lights out for you. 
[00:33:00]  Why were they going to fight?  Why?  Well, he called us a bunch of figs because we were eating peppers and balls.  And then this guy decided to mouth off to Bubba Ray.  Yes.  And Bubba Ray was ready to smack him down like that hockey dad in Massachusetts.  Yeah, all I had to do was hit him, though.  Well, yeah.  So Bubba Ray talked smack to him.  Jimmy talked smack back.  Now Bubba Ray's really pissed and really does want to hit Jimmy.  So he's trying to get Jimmy to touch him first.  How big is Bubba Ray?  He's ridiculously big.  How big is Jimmy?  You watch him on TV, you don't understand because everyone's big. 
[00:33:30]  He's almost as big as that door right there.  I'll tell you something, Jimmy, a big guy.  He's a guy that in the normal world would intimidate you at the bar or something like that if he was, you know, pushing you around or something.  Big guy.  But in the world of the WWF, Jimmy was nothing.  He was looking at Bubba Ray's looking at him like, he's wiped the floor with you.  Yeah, he sized him up and he was ready to go.  Yeah, he was ready to kick my ass.  But, please, peace.  Bubba Ray congrats.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[00:34:00]  At least Jimmy's 6'2".  EverQuest reference.  Give it to me.  What?  I didn't even know.  What?  I just got an obscure EverQuest reference.  Oh, okay.  What the hell?  That'll help the ratings.  Of course it will.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, is this the tavern?  Yeah, it's Tavern Talk.  Is Joe Dildo there?  Joe Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to get you into the tavern, Uncle John.  Give me another moxie.  Hey, would you like a beer?  Oh, sure.  A cup, please. 
[00:34:30]  Alcoholic?  Hey, last night.  Hold on.  Let me get you the beer.  There you go.  Ah, thank you.  A cold one.  Ah, there it is.  Right here in the tavern.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, last night, last night, Norton made a comment.  You guys let go by.  I can't believe you missed it.  What was it?  You were talking about different kinds of sex, and you said armpit sex, and he went yuck?  Yeah.  Like he tried it, right?  I mean, but of all the things he finds wonderful, armpit sex makes him go yuck. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good one.  The only thing consistent with Norton is his inconsistency.  That's right.  It is ridiculous.  You would completely think he'd be one way on something, and he's the other way.  Like, he likes the salty yellow discipline, yet the other side means nothing to you.  It's disgusting.  The hot lunch.  Yeah, yuck.  And then...  Unless it's totally in solid form. 
[00:35:30]  And then yesterday, he said he liked the Golden Girls TV show.  But every person's inconsistency.  You know what I mean?  We all have weird things, like, you like that and that?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but you're way on opposite ends of the spectrum.  Yeah, really.  You watch the Golden Girls.  Meanwhile, you'd probably like to rape the three of them.  You know what I mean?  Sort of weird.  No, Rue, I wouldn't mind.  Rue?  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind having to go in her mouth.  The old grandma one?  Mummy mouth.  Not a stalgetty, though.  Yeah, mummy mouth rules.  All right, Uncle John, thanks. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, yo, one more thing.  Yeah.  With that side virgin?  Yeah.  You've got to be careful.  They show up sex with a guy like a praying mantis and eat him afterwards.  Later, guys.  I want her to call back.  I kind of found her endearing.  I liked her.  Let me go to Danielle.  Danielle, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Listen, I want to know how it is that Opie can get so upset that his girlfriend likes it  when Triple H takes his shirt off.  Right.  But somehow I have a feeling that when they were going to have the wet t-shirt contest 
[00:36:30]  last night, betcha he wasn't getting off the couch, huh?  All right, listen.  You want me to explain this?  I don't get upset, but there's hypocrisy in my own little world there, okay?  We go to a lot of Islander games, and they have these 17, 18-year-old girls on skates  that come out, and we call them ice sluts.  They got a bucket and a shovel, and they come out, and they're there to titillate.  Are we allowed to say titillate?  A little titillate.  Titillation.  They're there to titillate the crowd, and if I ogle, ogle, good word, she gets all pissed 
[00:37:00]  off, and I could feel the tension, right?  Yeah.  I don't give a flying crap if she gets off seeing Triple H without a shirt on.  Yeah, but you said that you felt like an ass.  Well, yeah, that's natural, but I don't care that she's doing it.  But you don't understand why she gets aggravated when you want to look at that stuff.  No, see, I...  No, see, I'm not that way, so, you know... 
[00:37:30]  My girlfriend could go to a strip club every night of the week.  I wouldn't even care.  Yes, I don't care.  See, I go once every three months, you know, there's a problem.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, but it's a different thing.  Like, we go, and we laugh at that stuff.  No, you don't.  I know guys that have stripped.  Women are worse than guys in those clubs.  Well, you know, there are some that are really bad.  Yeah, they laugh a little.  They laugh a little.  They laugh a little, and then they're like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's big.  But it's all just a fun night out with the girls. 
[00:38:00]  I'll tell you what, honest to God, after I came home from that, I said to my fiance,  that, you know what, you can go whenever you want.  Because now that I've seen what goes on...  Oh, thank you for giving him permission.  Gee, nice.  I do what I want, and then I suffer the consequences.  Yeah, that's right.  No one is going to tell me, well, you know, well, I'm going to allow you to do this.  Screw that crap.  Well, no, it's not like that, but I mean, I don't care if he goes.  It's not before I wondered what went on.  Well, no, the guy's got to sit there.  If they even get close to touching one of these girls, two bikers kick him out the front door. 
[00:38:30]  Right, because the girls can make the guy.  Meanwhile, yeah, the girls can stick their hands down those G-strings and yank the crank on those male dancers.  Well, I didn't see any of that, but...  Oh, it's just a fun girls' night out, a little bachelorette party.  Speaking of girls' night out, we were thinking about going Thursday,  but first we're going to paint our toenails.  We wanted to see if Norton wanted to join us.  So are you going to ask permission?  You should never have to ask permission in a relationship.  Yeah.  No, we don't.  No, but I want to know if Norton wanted to join us for girls' night out, 
[00:39:00]  what with the golden girls and everything.  What are you doing?  We thought we'd get together and, like, have a pedicure, you know,  and then go to the male strip club.  A little paint-the-toenail party.  I'd like to paint your toenails with a hatchet.  You know you want to come.  I'm not into feet.  Thank you.  All right, have a good one, guys.  All right, bye.  Bye.  All right, we need the fat version to call, because now I'm preoccupied with that.  Yeah.  We need her to call.  So, why don't we, uh, I got the barroom prank calls that Uncle John was doing. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  We'll play this.  We'll take a break, and we'll discuss our virginity contest next,  because now I think we might have to find another girl to do it.  Ah, she seemed like the perfect lunatic.  We had this girl late in the show yesterday.  What a mess, but God, what a soul, too.  Would have been good.  She was going to pretty much lose her virginity live in our show a week from today.  Maybe she's at the pet store.  For her 18th virginity.  Did you look up that number?  Did you look up the number of the pet store and call that? 
[00:40:00]  No, I don't remember.  Everyone knows?  How about that?  Hold on, how about this?  Do we have any good prizes to give away?  Sure.  All right, it's going to take a little work, but she announced where she worked yesterday.  Yeah.  Someone go to the store right now and get her on the phone for us.  We'll give you a prize.  Where was she from?  What town?  I want to say Jersey.  It's definitely Jersey.  You have her phone number, right?  We have her number, but it doesn't say what town.  Well, she'd have a little prefix on the front.  She announced where she worked yesterday.  She announced where she worked yesterday.  Someone was paying attention. 
[00:40:30]  You guys pay attention to every little thing we say.  I remember it was something like Gruffy's or something like that, right?  Gruffy's?  Was it Gruffy's?  Scruffy's.  Scruffy's.  Oh, was it?  Okay, so, look.  Gruffy's Pet Store in Wayne.  That's what the sheep lover from Jersey said.  All right.  Call that.  Well, now you're not going to be able to because our listeners...  Hey, listeners.  Call her and tell her to call the show.  Yeah, please.  See if you can maybe get her to the phone by leading a little chum up to it. 
[00:41:00]  Jesus.  All right, check this out.  Hello.  Hello.  Is it Al where?  Al, is that what you're here?  No.  Call her.  Al?  Call her.  Al, call her.  Oh, shit.  Al, call her.  Somebody by that name.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Hello.  Hello. 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  This is Tuba?  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder if you could help me.  I'm looking for Phil Myers.  M-I-Z-A.  Myers.  Phil Myers.  Myers, yeah.  Phil Myers.  Phil Myers.  There's nobody by that name.  You're not there?  No.  Okay, thank you.  Hello?  Yeah, I'd like to know if you could tell me if there's an Al kill you there.  Al kill you.  Al kill you? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Kill you.  Right.  What's his name?  I'll kill you.  Al kill you.  Al kill you.  Al kill you.  No, nobody by that name.  Oh, look, there was supposed to be a few guys there, you know.  Could you call me?  How about Stanley Payne?  Stanley Payne there, you know?  Sally Shreper?  Sally who?  Stanley Payne.  Hello?  Stanley Payne.  What are you trying to kid me now? 
[00:42:30]  No.  What's wrong with you?  You want to hear you kick me around?  What?  I see you're f***ing bum.  You want to kick me here, butterf***er?  I'll come down and kick your f***ing mouth up.  I'll say why you go out and f*** your mother.  I'll f*** your mother, you stupid son of a...  Why don't you come down here and have a little knock?  See you come down and tell me that place in the face?  I'll break your f***ing kiddo.  I'll give you a hundred dollars to buy it.  A hundred dollars?  You haven't even gotten a hundred dollars.  Well, listen, you f***ing mother f***er. 
[00:43:00]  Come over here.  Come over here.  Come over here.  I'll try a mile.  I need what I'm doing to get.  Yeah.  I'll cut your f***ing balls out.  You f***ing f***er.  You mother f***er.  You scumbag.  Hello?  I'll speak with Joe, please.  Joe?  Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  Not here.  You sure?  Positive.  Okay, thanks. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, this is Jim Brewer.  I won!  The air is about to rock!  Fire!  You listen to Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're trying to hunt down Carolyn, the fat virgin.  But we found out she works at Scruffy's Pet Store.  Well, she said that yesterday, so we're not giving out anything that she did not. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  We have a guy outside of Scruffy's right now looking for her.  Because we need her to call the show yesterday.  She left us hanging at the end of the show.  Rob, what's up?  Well, what's up, guys?  What's going on?  Where are you?  I'm outside Scruffy's Pet.  I don't wait right now.  Hi, Ed.  Yeah, but she doesn't work there.  What do you mean she doesn't work there?  Well, she got fired because I went in and there's a skinny redhead and an old broad and  some old guys.  And what is it?  I said, is Carolyn working?  And the guys that call us, don't worry about Carolyn, she's not here. 
[00:44:30]  Well, maybe she's not working today.  I don't know.  He's just like letting on and she doesn't work there anymore.  Well, I hope we have the right pet store.  Yeah, right away.  I think that is it.  Sure.  Seems like the right pet store.  Rob, you're a good soldier for trying to find her for us.  I appreciate that.  Thanks, man.  I would have banged her.  All right, hold on a line.  We're going to give you a prize for making the effort today, okay?  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Give Rob something.  What a coincidence, Anthony.  She's calling in.  Oh, thank God.  But she doesn't want to go on the air.  Why?  What? 
[00:45:00]  She doesn't want to go on the air?  She can't go on the air.  Why?  Um, internal family friction.  Can we do the one-sided conversation?  She'll do that, though.  All right.  I never got that problem.  Well, it's our virginity contest.  Damn it.  For Valentine's Day, we're going to have virgins losing their virginity live on the O.P. and Anthony show.  And Carolyn was going to be our first contestant.  Mm-hmm.  And she didn't want to wait until Valentine's Day.  She turns 18 a week from today, and she wants to get it done.  Right.  But we found out she's a little wacky. 
[00:45:30]  A little O.C.D., a little overweight.  She likes the cutting.  She's a cutter.  An eater.  Been in an institution.  Cutter and an eater.  So that goes hand in hand, obviously.  Put her on that phone.  All right.  All right.  I'm pretty good at the one-sided conversation.  Yeah, but, Ed, you've got to get her on the air.  Yeah.  Try to get her on the air.  Hello?  Hey, how you doing?  Ooh.  I want to know if I can talk.  Why?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:46:00]  This is the oddest thing ever.  She said, are you serious?  What?  She goes, I'd rather talk to Opie instead of you because you make fun of people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She goes, I make fun of me?  Do you listen to this show?  Are you kidding me?  All right, let me talk.  Opie's a sick son of a bitch.  Let me talk.  No, she said it's cool now.  I'm going to do the repeat talking.  Now, what seems to be the problem?  My parents are pissed off, and I got cold.  I got cold feet. 
[00:46:30]  How did your parents find out?  My dad and my brother are listening to the show.  I thought we had no listeners.  And what did they say to you?  Uh, that I'm dead meat.  We're dead meat?  Her mom just walked by and said she's dead meat.  Uh, they heard that show yesterday?  Heard everything you said?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did they hear all the nice things we said about her?  Yeah, did they hear the nice stuff?  I didn't even hear that. 
[00:47:00]  Can we shut up?  Now, did you know that your father and brother are fans of this program?  Yeah.  So, why would you call up with your real name and where you work and your hometown?  Because they were supposed to be at the doctor's office.  So, I wasn't thinking, she says.  So, what do you want to do?  Why can't you come on the air with us?  I don't want to. 
[00:47:30]  My dad says no.  Well, they're the one that effed you up as bad as you are.  Can we talk to her father on the air?  Can we talk to your dad?  On the air.  Put your dad on the phone.  Tell him he's not on the air.  I just want to talk to him.  Is she getting him?  Yeah.  Tell him it's not on the air.  I just want to talk to him.  Say he's not on the air.  I don't hear you saying that.  Remember, kids, I'm the nice one.  Hmm.  She doesn't seem to be a... 
[00:48:00]  No, huh?  What does he do for a living?  He's a what?  He's a...  She goes, he's a car...  Nothing, nothing.  Were you going to say carpenter?  Car driver.  Car jagger?  Cardiac surgeon.  Carvel employee.  Carpet layer.  Car...  The ledge changing guy.  What?  Card store manager.  He's nothing. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  You don't want to say what he is.  Carnival ride.  Carnival ride guy.  I think we have to let her go.  Yeah, I don't think it's going to work out.  I think it's over, Johnny.  Why?  Where do you work?  You don't work at a pet's place.  Where do you work?  So she doesn't work at the pet store?  You don't work at the pet store?  All right, everyone leave the pet stores alone.  Please.  You don't work at the pet store anymore?  Did you get fired?  What happened?  Did you get fired? 
[00:49:00]  She's got to go, she's saying.  Aw.  Boy, you were fun for like a few minutes.  All right.  Ah, she says she's sorry.  Well, if there's anything we can do for her, please, please give us a call back.  Blah, blah, blah.  We'll smooth everything out if she comes back.  All righty.  All right.  There you go.  Well, we lost her.  Eh, she tried.  We lost her.  Oh, boy.  We lost her.  Contest back on.  The father seems very angry. 
[00:49:30]  Well, she gave out too much personal info.  Well, yeah.  Well, no dad wants to know his daughter's going to lose her virginity on the radio.  No dad is like, oh, it's good to hear.  Oh, stop it.  Family radio show.  They want to hear like you just got accepted to Harvard.  Yeah.  Not, hey, dad, I'm going to get banged on Opie and Anthony.  My father was mad enough when I stepped in.  All right.  Daniela, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you guys?  Real good today.  Well, there's a couple things I want to tell you guys.  Okay.  My 20th birthday is coming up January 24th, right? 
[00:50:00]  Uh-huh.  And I've been in threesomes before.  Yes.  And I want to do it again.  Uh-huh.  And I want to do it live on, like, the radio.  Oh, yeah?  Well, we've got to do the virgin thing for us.  Yeah.  Well, I'll do the...  You're not a virgin.  That's obvious.  Well, can we find a virgin lesbian?  No, no, no.  Well, that's lesbian for a day.  We could do that.  Yeah, you're mixing up all our bits.  We're on to this one bit, and we've got to make it happen.  Well, I know you guys are going to make it happen, but I listen to you guys every day. 
[00:50:30]  I'm like...  Well, let us get this bit out of the way, and then you...  Well, you know, and then you help us out with that one down the road.  Yeah, down the road.  My birthday's in 17 more days.  All right.  And you guys can help me.  How about...  Well, it says on the phone line, made sex tapes with boyfriend, broke up.  Well, yeah, that's the thing, too.  But he won't give them up.  Yeah, how do I get him to give him back my tapes?  It can't be done.  He's never going to give them back.  You're done.  You're done.  What kind of sex tapes did you make?  Oh, they're pretty intense.  What do you mean?  You know, like...  Changing camera angles? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, you can see that.  Good close-ups on that place.  You should never...  The dirtiest of dirty spots in the world.  I don't think you should ever make a sex tape.  No.  Oh, why?  There's so much fun.  You make a sex tape, you watch it, then you erase it.  No, you don't.  Well, I don't think you do.  No.  Who would film themselves with me?  Hey, what's your boyfriend's name?  Uh, Brent.  Would he send us a copy?  Um, he listens to you guys.  He's probably listening right now.  He's probably going to kill me now.  Uh, send us a copy of, uh, Daniela.  Yeah, tell him.  And you banging if you listen. 
[00:51:30]  How many tapes did you make?  Uh, probably about seven.  Wow, seven volumes.  Yeah.  Did he have a storyline, or was it just, uh, you guys going at it?  No, we just went at it, and then, like...  And sometimes, like, I would ask him if we could get it on tape, and...  Oh, we have lots of pictures, too.  And he won't even send me the pictures.  And how old are you?  I'm going to be 20.  20, okay.  And what do you look like?  Um, I have short black hair.  Uh-huh.  It's pretty spiky.  Um, I'm told they're very sexy and cute. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Um, I'm very skinny.  I have no bunt.  Nice.  Um...  No bunt.  That's always a good feature.  Yeah.  I have long legs.  That's like the first thing you say.  Long legs?  Yeah, long legs.  How tall are you?  I'm about 5'5".  5'5", long legs, no bunt, small boobs, probably.  No, not really.  What do you got?  Probably, like, a 38B.  38?  I've been told they were perfect.  Wait, you're a 38B?  Um, just about.  Oh, that's a little rough.  You're a wide-shouldered gal? 
[00:52:30]  Um, I guess so.  Like, I work out.  Are you a heavy gal?  How much do you weigh?  About 120.  125, 5?  Yeah, no, 120.  Oh, he's pulling the chart out.  Hold on.  He's checking the chart.  Okay.  Yeah, you're okay.  But the bra size gives you a couple, uh, demerits here.  38B is a little weird.  Doesn't like...  Guys, how can I get on your show?  I would love to get on your show.  You're on the show.  Because, like, I'm the type of person I've been told that, like, I'm very open about my sexuality,  and I like it.  Like, I have a girlfriend, and I had a boyfriend, and I want to be open about it with you guys.  I'm actually holding auditions, um, early next week. 
[00:53:00]  We could, we could, uh, save you for the lesbian for a day, uh, thing.  Yeah, that's easy.  You'll be the first girl to pull the glass from the pinball machine out of your butt.  Yeah, that's easy.  Please, please, please think about me and, like, remember me.  Because, like, I'll be calling in more, because I want to get involved with you guys.  All right, Danielle.  Thank you, guys.  Well, Bubba Ray's here, so we've got to hang up on you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  What's up, Bubba Ray?  How you doing, man?  We were discussing how scary you are.  I don't know if you heard on the way over.  That guy who's ass you almost kicked when, uh, he was in here. 
[00:53:30]  How am I a scary guy?  You called up.  Well, uh, you're very intimidating.  Jim Norton, stand up next to Bubba Ray.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That would be awful.  If it was a present shower, you would just be done.  I wouldn't even fight.  I don't even need any soap for you.  I wouldn't even fight.  You'd moan with pleasure just to make him happy.  Don't get carried away.  We were talking about, uh, we were talking about Triple H's return to the WWF, and Norton  was cocky enough to say that some, you were saying stupid crap. 
[00:54:00]  I was kidding, of course.  What were you saying about Triple H?  Have you seen him lately?  He's jacked up to the nines.  I heard he's a big dude.  He looks like an action figure now.  He's huge.  He doesn't look real.  He's huge.  I saw him walking around.  And he has this valley in the middle of his chest where his pecs meet.  I mean, birds could land on his pecs and use it as a little, like, washing station and  drink from it.  His chest is huge.  He's just been lifting for eight months straight.  That's all he had to do, Jim. 
[00:54:30]  He has hands.  Those are hands that he would slap you and knock you out.  He's done that.  You know these hands?  Yeah, look at that.  Those are, like, knock out.  He's done that in this station, almost.  Yeah, pretty much, man.  He's got those, like, paws like a lion has, you know, and they just swat the gazelle in  it.  It doesn't have a chance.  Spins around and then the teeth into the throat.  So how are you guys doing?  Good, man.  Jim Norton's like the weak gazelle.  He's a big, he's a wrestler.  It's hard to, you can't put, you're not exactly going to, you know, stand up and give  this man a hassle.  He beat up Stevie Richards. 
[00:55:00]  Stevie Richards choked him out.  Choked me out.  Exactly.  Pretty bad.  You ever mess with a wrestler?  No.  I'm not an idiot.  Don't ever.  Why would I?  It's a dumb thing to do.  I think the first person to do it was Richard Belzer years ago.  Remember when Belzer had that TV show and he had, I think it was Hulk Hogan and Mr.  T on.  Yep.  And he's talking about, ah, that wrestling, so fake, babe.  Right.  So fake.  Right, right.  And the Hulkster's like, I'll show you fake, brother. 
[00:55:30]  And, like, he grabbed him, put him in a chokehold, choked him out, let go of him.  His head hits the floor.  He starts bleeding and wound up suing both of them.  Got a settlement from him.  But I think that was the last reference he ever made to a wrestler.  Norton Pro Wrestling is kind of like your woman's orgasm.  How's that?  Something to do with fake.  Only the one doing it truly knows.  In other words, the Dr. D, too, David Schultz with 2020. 
[00:56:00]  That was before.  That's right.  That was where he choked out John Stossel.  Yeah, he was doing an expose or whatever.  That's right.  But this past summer up in Boston when we were at the River Rave, WWF went in and I to film  a little piece with Stevie Richards and I think it was just Stevie Richards, right?  And I'm like, oh, they're filming, you know, all right, I'll make it good, no problem, you  know?  The guy choked me out for real.  The chokeout move is great because it's not like a hit.  So you're not hitting the person and leaving a mark. 
[00:56:30]  Never.  You guys use that one all the time on people that you just want to bleh.  I could choke out Norton.  No, I think he might actually die.  Seriously, about four seconds of pressure to the carotid artery and you'd be out.  I would just bleed on you.  This part of the arm, the bicep, and this part gets on each side of your neck and just  and that's it.  Did you guys go to the show last night?  No.  Why?  I was watching it at home.  Why wouldn't you go to the live show?  What about tonight?  Maybe tonight.  You know something?  I had tickets for tonight. 
[00:57:00]  I gave them to somebody else though.  I just gave four to my Uncle Tom.  I get people.  We get people.  I swear to you.  The WWF tickets are the hottest friggin' ticket we get here.  The second we get them, the phone's ringing.  You got to hook me up.  Well, allow me to be an ambassador of goodwill to the station and to the WWF fans because  I hold in my hand four very, very good and very close to the ring seats right here that  we can give away on the air if you guys want.  Give away on the air. 
[00:57:30]  You know something?  I might go tonight then.  No, I want to see somebody come in here and get naked for these tickets.  You got more than four there.  Norton will do it.  Yeah, but these are for my friends.  Okay.  I only have two in there for my friends.  Well, we can have people come down here and do something.  We can't give away just on the phones.  No, that sucks.  Let Bubba Ray choke you out.  I don't know.  Boy, I might want to go.  Well, the Triple H.  You can go, though.  You don't need these tickets.  We'll get you in the front row.  Oh, hey.  Really?  Look at you in the front row. 
[00:58:00]  You guys are impotent.  Impotent.  Impotent.  So, hey, Bubba Ray, we got to say it.  It was cool that Triple H came back last night, but 10 to 11?  10 to 11.  That's what time you went on?  That's when he finally made it.  The big tease.  Well, you know, yeah.  It's the big tease, you know?  They teased it.  It's like when you guys do a show and, you know, you're going to have some chick do some  wild and crazy thing.  You take it off four commercials, right?  Before she shoves anything in her back door.  Well, I think we learned a valuable lesson from the WWF.  We won't tease less because it was frustrating as hell last night. 
[00:58:30]  Was it really?  But you didn't enjoy the buildup of the show?  It was a really good show last night.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  The crowd is going crazy with that.  You want to hear how sick and twisted and demented the fans in New York City are?  Before we go live, Lillian Garcia always comes out and she sings the National Anthem.  Oh, no.  In the middle of the National effing Anthem.  They're screaming, what?  What?  What?  What?  What?  After every line. 
[00:59:00]  You know something?  See?  We're totally getting back to normal.  A bunch of a-holes.  Because a couple of months back, you would never have seen anything like that.  People, tears in their eyes during the singing of the National Anthem.  And now, what?  What?  A dog could have woofed the National Anthem.  Right.  We're all tearing.  And now they're saying what?  Only Steve Austin could take a word like what.  What?  And get the entire wrestling community.  Tell him to stop.  The wrestling community.  The three times thing, though.  He has to say everything three times. 
[00:59:30]  If you want, I can call him on a cell phone and you can tell him yourself to stop saying  that.  I've had enough problems with you guys.  I'm messing with you, man.  I like when Vince got out there, though, at the top of the show and everyone's just, everything  is saying what, what, I don't want to hear that what.  Like they're going to stop when he says that.  If you chant what one more time, I'm going to really be pissed off.  So what's the real story with Vince McMahon's eye?  Ric Flair slipped with that hit?  Ric, I don't know about slipping.  That's the wrong thing.  Ric Flair decided, you know.  Ric Flair and Vince have a long, long history.  Flair might have just said, ah, to hell with it. 
[01:00:00]  I can get away with this.  Here's one of my only chances.  I'm popping Vince in the eye.  Ric Flair was bleeding like a stuck pig last night, man.  Yes, he was.  Bad.  Yes.  Vince hit him with a pipe.  Yeah.  And then when he got thrown into the stairs to the ring, it was lappled.  When I saw Vince yesterday, I said hello.  I shook his hand.  I'm like, damn, when he got there, boss is shiny.  He's like, yeah, you know, Ric, you know, he caught me with one.  I was like, well, I'm sure he'll get Ric back tonight, won't you?  Yeah.  He tooled on him pretty good.  Oh, he blasted him.  Damn nice. 
[01:00:30]  If anybody can bleed like a stuck pig, it's definitely Ric Flair.  Yeah, he looks like a bleeder.  All pale and stuff.  That white hair.  And the white hair.  Yeah, the blood just shows up even better on it.  The proverbial crimson mask.  The camera quickly went up when Ric Flair went for the little razor.  What razor?  Hey, what are you saying, Opie?  What are you talking about?  You go ahead.  Tell Bubba Ray how you think he was bleeding.  He got hit over the head with a pipe and he got lacerated.  That's how he was bleeding.  Go ahead.  The pipe bent in half and then was straight again, though. 
[01:01:00]  What?  I'm not saying that.  I'm going to bend something in heaven and straighten it out.  Dude, I was so carsick from that ride home the last time you were here, by the way.  Oh, sorry.  I offer you a ride home in a limousine.  Oh, gee, Bubba, I got carsick.  No, I did because I was facing the wrong way.  We talked about it for like 20 minutes the next day.  It's always bad to sit the wrong way in a limo.  I'm facing backwards.  I'm facing the wrong way in a limousine, but this F, this guy's got connections in New York City. 
[01:01:30]  I don't want to call you out too much, but he says, you know, he's from Long Island, and he goes, hey, you need a ride home?  I'm going your way.  I'm like, fine.  We had a police escort to the tunnel.  Yeah.  How'd you pull that one off?  Yeah, that's nice.  Let's put it this way.  New York's bravest and New York's finest.  They're personal friends of mine, a lot of them.  So they take good care of us when we come into town.  But the limo driver is like, stop, go, stop, go, stop, go.  It's all about it, zigging in and out, jamming on the brakes.  That's how you've got to drive in this city. 
[01:02:00]  You got all pale.  You look like you've got to hurl.  Yeah.  When you finally got out of the limo, your girl was waiting for you.  You're like, oh, honey, thank God you're here.  Your chick was a little pale too there.  She was.  She was a little car sick.  She admits it.  She can't drive in a car.  You know, so we were trying to make conversation the whole way.  Yeah.  So.  Well, they almost hurled.  All right.  That would have been good.  All right.  Cheap plug time.  Who's going to SmackDown tonight?  All right.  I think you guys are going to do fine with the SmackDown.  I think it's going to be sold out.  It's almost sold out.  I think there's like maybe like 12 tickets left. 
[01:02:30]  Really?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  You can still get a couple of tickets.  How many Bubba signs have you seen with the string since the last appearance?  You guys don't understand.  You don't understand.  People on the streets in the grocery store.  I'm checking out, you know, like a piece of honeydew.  Hey, Bubba, you see the string?  What's that string?  What's that string?  Explain that because we're in a few brand new cities since the last time you got here.  Bubba was in last time.  We had just sickness and debauchery going on in this studio.  We had a girl. 
[01:03:00]  I can't quite recall her talent.  I was doing the age thing.  Oh, you were checking her age.  That was tremendous.  Isn't that amazing?  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Hope he can figure out a girl's age to the year.  Never, never, exactly on the year.  Has never lost at this game.  You've done it how many times now?  Five?  I'm only like five for five.  Five for five.  Only five for five by checking out some girl's taint.  Rings.  Taint.  Or taint.  She bends over.  He looks closely at the taint.  And he tells the age.  So this girl was doing it.  And we had commented that we saw, again, because this seems to happen a lot, a little white string. 
[01:03:30]  The little white string that tells you.  Everyone completely freaking out.  Tells you which pills she's on in her pack of birth control.  And we had talked about it and done some jokes on it.  And then as time is going by and Hope is looking at her taint, out of nowhere, Bubba Ray goes,  Hey, what's that string?  Right.  Like, completely out of the mix.  Oblivious.  Ten minutes later, we just lost our minds. 
[01:04:00]  And then people started showing up at the WWF events with, Hey, Bubba, what's that string?  I was at a show in Jersey after that radio show aired.  And there's a huge sign, Bubba, what's that string?  And the guy strategically placed about half a dozen tampons on his sign.  People throwing balls of yarn and string in the ring at me.  Oh, that's classic.  Oh, that's that string.  That's funny.  Anthony wants to say hi.  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, Bubba, I want to congratulate you on losing your tag titles to two midgets, you 
[01:04:30]  camouflage GI Joe looking pussy.  Oh, if he was down here, I would love to see this guy down here.  You know what?  He was too busy looking at the...  Typical.  Typical.  GI Joe, real American homo.  Typical.  How's your mother?  How's your mother?  How's your mother?  How's your mother?  How's your mother?  How's your mother?  You fat.  Thank you.  You're out of shape wrestling tool douche.  Thank you.  Thank you.  God, I wish you was down here.  I'm a seven-time world champion.  You're a jabroni talking to me on the radio.  That guy would crap himself.  I so know if he was down here, he would crap himself. 
[01:05:00]  You know what's funny?  And I know you're really good friends with Taz.  The table misfired, the leg bent, and then Taz had to hold it up so you got...  What do you mean it misfired?  I think you were supposed to...  In the heat of the battle, as he tried to suplex me through a table, it didn't work.  It didn't work, but then the leg's bent, and then he's holding the leg so you guys could  finish the match.  I thought it was a good match.  It was definitely a good match.  I thought it was exciting.  It was a very exciting match, but it's funny to see Taz covering, because that was not 
[01:05:30]  supposed to happen.  Come on.  What are the chances of the guy that just called actually coming down to the radio station  and meeting me in person, shaking my hand, and saying it in person?  I tell you what.  I will give that guy these four tickets to the show tonight if he shows up here.  There you go.  And $500 in cash.  There you go.  I knew you couldn't get past that last call.  $500 in cash, plus these four tickets just to come down to the radio station and say  personally to my face.  I knew you couldn't get past that.  I'll take the lawsuit.  I know enough cops in this city where I'll drive his face right into the middle of 7th 
[01:06:00]  Avenue that they'll pull me down to the station, slap me on the wrist.  I'll be back by 7.30, ready to be on SmackDown tonight.  See, that's why I was trying to change the subject.  I know he was not going to be able to get past that call.  $500 and four tickets.  And four tickets.  He will not show up.  He's up now.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I'll go down there and arm wrestle Bubba Ray.  Okay, great.  Okay.  Arm wrestle.  Cool.  Come down and arm wrestle me.  I'm 6'5", 270.  Okay, so what?  I think I can take you.  How are you at arm wrestling, Bubba Ray?  Because I've seen big guys lose to smaller guys because of the technique or anything. 
[01:06:30]  I have done some arm wrestling matches on the air with various radio stations, and to date  I have a perfect record.  Perfect record.  Hey, but I could try, though.  Yeah, you could try.  You could lose, but you could try.  Well, hey, at least I'm trying.  The other guy, he's just calling it up to play.  Why don't you try?  You sound like a guy who'd like to try and take the wiffle ball bat challenge.  I'll take that, too.  Hey, we've got to get a new wiffle ball bat, by the way.  The year's over.  Oh, the year's over.  We need a brand new wiffle ball bat.  And are you going to watch that one off on eBay?  We should.  We've got to crown the champion and find out who won the wiffle ball bat challenge last year. 
[01:07:00]  Mike, where are you right now?  I'm in Edison, though.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So you call up on the radio, challenging me to arm wrestle, but, oh, no, I'm in Edison.  I can't.  Well, yeah, I'm a big fan, and I want the tickets.  Okay.  I've got to try.  I've got to try.  Why don't you call up and say something intelligent?  I've got to try, you know?  Okay.  Sorry.  Bye.  All right.  Watch Smackdown on TV today on UPN.  I mean Thursday.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Papa.  Yeah.  How bad does your head hurt from last night when that table did not break? 
[01:07:30]  That looked pretty painful.  Actually, I didn't really hit my head.  It was more on the shoulders, and, you know, no matter when you go through a table, whether  it breaks or not, it still hurts.  That looked pretty painful last night.  You've got to land on it.  Fortunately, I've been doing that stuff for landing on those tables and getting hit with  that crap for about 10 years.  Quite a while now.  My body's pretty numb to it.  We've got the clip of Bubba Ray finally catching on.  Oh, do we?  With the string?  Cool.  That story you just told?  Yeah.  I lose the string.  Your head?  The one that you've shaved on top of your neck? 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  That's good.  You've got to back up a little so I can get a good view.  What?  Can we have a little private moment over here?  What?  Absolutely not.  I'll have a private moment with you.  Oh, I know what she's going to say.  Oh, no.  Do you know what I'm going to say or do you have my mind?  Oh, no.  Can you be mine?  This never works.  All right.  That's okay.  I thought for the first time, everyone's fine about it.  I thought for the first time, I get to know.  Show off my talent with a hot chicken. 
[01:08:30]  Everyone's fine about it.  I'm the worst.  Bad timing.  You've got to understand, Tristan, it's not a problem.  Maybe not for you.  Opie, why is it a problem for you?  Place on ground.  Life fuse.  Get away.  I thought for the first time, I was going to get, you know.  Come on, whoops.  Show the talent off to a hot chicken.  Oh, no.  I'm fine.  It's okay.  I'm fine with it.  It's fine.  Everyone's fine.  It's a natural.  Who hasn't had crime scene sex?  Haven't you had that at some point?  Absolutely.  Where the bed looks like, if it's in a hotel, you're afraid you're going to get a call from 
[01:09:00]  the cops when you leave and check out?  Who hasn't done that?  It just might confuse my powers a little bit.  Who hasn't made the bed look like Nicola Brown's sidewalk?  Right.  Come on, who?  Pretend this is not a regular Charlie and Joe.  No, I'm fine.  This one's going to be...  You might want to step back then.  Jamaican Mike sees this every time he has sex.  All right, I'm here.  All the time, man.  Everybody wants your book, by the way.  It's called collateral damage.  We're going to promote your book like crazy. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  You are going to get...  Jamaican Mike's got the bunker buster.  The bunker buster.  The 5,000 pounders.  It penetrates 20 feet in the earth.  That's a nice tattoo, by the way.  Wow, look at you.  Yeah.  All right.  Look at that.  Get in the light so the other guys can see, because I'd like to share.  Do the light?  No, get in the light.  No, you can just go that way.  Get in the light.  There you go.  Go into the light.  She's very well put together.  What do you think, Bubba Ray? 
[01:10:00]  Things are going well right now.  Things are going well.  That's good.  Okay.  All right, wait.  I'm almost done.  I'm doing some calculations here.  Doing some calculating.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's that thing hanging?  Oh, very telling.  Bubba Ray.  That's what she was talking about.  Oh, no.  You just figured it out.  You are...  You just figured it out.  You are so quick, Bubba Ray.  Hey, Bubba Ray, you're way behind, man.  I took you for a smart gentleman.  I'm going to be sick. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Bubba Ray, you're way behind.  All right.  I was just about to...  Bubba Ray, where have you been?  Oh, Vince, I need the day off.  Okay.  Put your coat right in here.  No, no, that's okay.  That's okay.  I'm a little slow today.  I have an excuse.  What's yours?  That's good.  There you are.  You finally caught on.  I love that clip.  And after all the hints you guys dropped, crime scene...  We're talking about...  Yeah.  The whole conversation was focused on that. 
[01:11:00]  Not a clue.  Hey, what's going on down there?  What's going on down there?  Let me go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hello.  Yeah, Joe.  Yeah, I'll come down there arm wrestling.  I can be down there in 20 minutes.  I'll not only arm wrestle them, and then I'll take the tickets from them.  It feels so good to be home in New York.  You're 6'2", 230 pounds?  220.  220?  Oh, boy.  So...  And I have no...  If you're going to do that, bring your wife. 
[01:11:30]  Now, another guy is 6'6", 270.  Everybody...  I can be there in 20 minutes.  And you'll arm wrestle Bubba Ray?  I'll arm wrestle Bubba Ray.  I don't care.  If anybody shows up, I'd be more than happy.  All right.  Now, if you show up.  You're offering me a fight, you're sure.  All right, show up.  Sure, come on down.  I'll be down there in 20 minutes.  Okay, you get down here.  I will.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We'll see if that guy shows.  We should take a break. 
[01:12:00]  Bubba Ray Dudley in the studio.  How long can you stay?  You're wrestling tonight?  Yeah, actually, we won't be hanging out too much longer because we've got to get back to...  Because that guy's coming down to wrestle?  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, you know what?  That last call scared me so much that, sorry, guys, I've got to run out of the studio.  And, you know...  Yeah.  Yeah, but we've got a lot of stuff going on tonight.  You know, it was taping SmackDown.  And the Garden's just about sold out.  So if you haven't got your tickets, you can probably call Ticketmaster or just go to the Garden and get them.  The Garden's going to be rocking tonight. 
[01:12:30]  It was crazy last night.  Crazy.  It was one of the best garden crowds.  They look great on TV.  I mean, I enjoyed it, except for Triple H coming out with five minutes left in the program.  Yeah, but, you know...  But it was worth it, you know.  The build-up will be slow now.  And, you know, Triple H...  I'd say Inventor of Black Guy is always funny.  You know what?  It's going to be great because I think for the first time in a long time,  the company is really back at full strength with, you know, Rocky, Austin, Triple H, Taker,  you know, all the, you know, the big, big names, Kane. 
[01:13:00]  What about Billy Gunn, that new gimmick?  How long is that going to last?  Billy and Chuck?  I love it.  I think it's great.  You like the Billy and Chuck?  Yeah, I think it's great.  I think it's great.  A little rough.  Six foot, you know, five apiece.  Great bodies.  Blonde hair.  It's tremendous.  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  Any more ass kissing going to happen or what?  I don't know.  It's been a while.  I hope I don't have to kiss so much.  Yeah, that would be really bad.  Blubber Ray, we know you personally a little bit.  What would you do if Vince came up to you and said,  Blubber Ray, I have an idea.  Let's put it this way. 
[01:13:30]  Tonight's show, you're going to come out and kiss my ass.  Like, oh.  Wait, it would be something like this.  On your knees.  Not again, Vince.  What would you do, really?  Well, I know how much you love wrestling.  Let's put it this way.  Yeah.  Vince had his head driven into Rikishi's ass.  Right, yeah.  How are you going to tell him no?  He's a trooper.  How are you going to turn around to the boss?  If the boss is going to do it.  If the boss is a damn billionaire.  Yeah, boss leads you away. 
[01:14:00]  You know, if he turns around and says,  You know, Bubba, I'd like you to rim this gentleman today.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  You know.  Wait, Danielle's calling back.  Danielle.  The ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  You guys have every soundbite for in WWF history.  Oh, all the wrestling sites.  They are classer.  When Vince goes off, everyone writes on the wrestling sites.  Well, I hope you and Anthony have more clips of Vince.  This is my favorite one right here.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I love that. 
[01:14:30]  You know how many times we use that in here?  Believe me.  Danielle, what's up?  I wish we had it for the string.  Danielle's calling back.  What's up?  Hey, I'm going to take the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Right now?  Yeah, my friend's going to take me up.  We're on the way down the station right now.  Nice.  Where do you live?  I bring out the best.  I bring out the best people.  He's my friend, Ken.  He's part of the...  How far are you from the station?  The way Ken drives, we'll probably be there in like 20 minutes.  All right, here's the deal.  You come down, you do the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  We'll give her the Smackdown tickets.  What does she look like?  She was just on. 
[01:15:00]  She sounds pretty hot.  She's going to be 20.  She's going to be 20.  Listen, it is exactly 433.  If you're not here by 445, I've got to split.  No, you can't.  You'll never make it.  You have to.  I can't make it that fast.  You've got to take one for the team, man.  Bubba Ray.  You're killing us.  You've got to take one for the team.  Actually, to be honest with you, I'd love to stay, but there's a bunch of guys on the  way down the station to try and kick my head.  Oh, come on.  Can you just leave the tickets there for me?  I'm going to do it. 
[01:15:30]  How old are you?  I'm 20.  Yeah, just 20.  Are you...  Bubba Ray, just leave the tickets.  All right, I'll leave the tickets.  You've got to take one for the team.  Thank you.  Okay.  You better do a good job from out here.  You better hook the boys in the studio up.  Oh, don't worry.  You better bury that thing down to the knob.  Choke up on that bed.  Is there a knob on it, Ben?  All right.  Hey, guys.  Okay.  All right, Danielle, get down here as fast as you can.  Danielle, you sound like you've got 38 bees.  What?  You don't see when I get there.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Hey, hey, can I bring my vibrator? 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  No.  No.  No, damn.  You keep that at home.  Let us check first.  Duh.  All right.  I'll see you guys in like 30 minutes.  This isn't tavern talk behavior.  Tavern talk.  Wait.  So when I get there, what do I do?  Take your clothes off coming to the studio and shove something in your gimmick.  Your gimmick.  Hold on.  Hold on, all right?  All right.  All right, cool.  Well, she's on the way down for the SmackDown tickets.  Live at the Garden tonight.  And we're doing the Opie and Anthony sign contest. 
[01:16:30]  I hope you guys at WWF don't mind.  What?  The best O&A related show sign will win a trip to the Royal Rumble.  Cool.  Royal Rumble's not this Sunday.  It's the following Sunday.  No, I know.  But tonight's the last.  I know you know.  I'm just plugging it.  Oh, yeah.  Scott, man, Vince teaches you guys well.  Yeah.  And it's live on pay-per-view.  Vince teaches you guys well.  Call your local cable provider for the Royal Rumble.  But best O&A sign will win the trip to the Royal Rumble.  And who's judging the O&A signs?  The listeners.  We had one last night the whole night. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know if you saw it at the corner of the ring.  It was a wow O&A 1027 sign.  As that last caller said.  I wouldn't like for Taz either.  That guy's crazy to say that about Taz.  Taz, no.  You know what?  I'm actually happy for Taz because ever since he got here,  they haven't been really using him to his potential.  So I'm glad that Taz, you know, this happened for Taz and Spike.  It was cool for them.  You know, right now there's not a lot of tag teams in the WWF.  Well, you got that Chuck and Billy thing.  Well, yeah.  They're bringing them up.  And Scotty Too Hotty and Prince Albert. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  You know, for the longest time.  Scotty Too Hotty's hilarious.  He's got the worm.  I love the worm.  The worm is hysterical.  Maybe Scotty can come down and we can use the worm for the wiffle ball challenge.  Some of these guys come up with finishing moves and you guys, you know, backstage have to go,  Dude, you're going to make a complete idiot out of yourself with that.  No, because if you notice, some of the stupidest stuff is the most popular.  The worm.  I mean, the worm is tremendous.  You know, the spinner-rooney.  I mean, the word what, isn't that like an adverb or something? 
[01:18:00]  What?  You know, and if anybody catches on, somebody's going to turn around and he says what and go, who?  Mm-hmm.  You know?  And then it's going to be like, where, what?  Who's on first?  What, yeah.  All right.  I've been in Costello 50 years later.  Yeah.  We love Bubba Ray Dudley.  No other callers calling to put me down and, you know, tell me what kind of a piece of crap I am?  I love it.  Plenty of them, but we've got to take a break.  Okay.  Bubba Ray Dudley in the studio.  I don't know if he'll be back.  We'll see.  You might have to leave.  You might stay.  What are you doing?  How long is your break?  Probably like three.  No, shorter breaks in the new year. 
[01:18:30]  Less commercials.  Less commercials.  We fought with the bosses and won a little battle, so.  Yep.  Great.  We'll be back.  Rain Wreck Radio.  Like a bunch of people cheering on a rake.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Oh, you scum.  Anthony.  Slime.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show in studio.  One of our friends, Bubba Ray Dudley from the WWF.  This is the greatest radio show in the history of radio, period.  Thank you. 
[01:19:00]  I believe so.  Thank you, Bubba Ray.  This job is better than mine, I think.  We're close to it.  And, Jim Norton, keep your mouth shut.  During commercials.  Hey, Bubba Ray, why doesn't Hulk Hogan wrestle anymore?  Hulk.  Hulk because he's 80?  Oh, my God.  That's not nice to say about the Hulkster.  Exactly.  There's a lot of little Hulksters out there still running around.  That means Hulk's coming back, right?  Hulk's on his way back.  He's going to be at the Garden tonight.  Oh, God.  Start that rumor.  You see the tool in the front row last night?  Dressed up as the Hulk?  No.  You saw that, right? 
[01:19:30]  Stop.  He's been a guy dressing up like Hogan for like 20 years, though.  Seriously.  Some old man with long blonde hair has been dressing up like Hogan for years,  and he always gets front row tickets.  Huh.  Really?  What happened?  Where am I going?  Nothing.  I just want a little sound on this.  Ah, fanful light from Yonkers as we get what Ant needs here.  Whoever created that Austin what angle should have their yam bag tied up to a rock  and have the rock thrown out a window.  I was at the Garden last night.  Three hours of what?  I was going insane. 
[01:20:00]  That's called getting over.  If you can have the fans screaming what, you know, for three hours,  obviously, you know, they're into it.  They're having fun.  And if the fans want to do it, they pay damn good money to us.  So shut your mouth.  And they're going to keep Debra out of the ring, right?  I don't know.  Austin money.  Debra's such a nice lady, too.  She's real nice, I understand.  She's really nice.  But Austin is much better by himself.  What the hell is this?  He's looking insane with his middle name.  He's as high as the sky.  He remains a saint with the training and the prayers and the vitamins, too. 
[01:20:30]  Don't mess with us.  We'll beat you, too.  That's the Hulkster.  The Hulkster's back.  What other Hulkster song do I have?  Hey, Bobberay, you got a little song you're working on?  No.  Like the Hulk?  No.  We've actually had a couple bands write songs for us.  I am?  Yeah.  A couple of New York City bands.  This one kid, Dave.  I know.  He used to be on some Dudley website.  He's in a band.  I can't even hear that. 
[01:21:00]  Yes, because the phone's screaming and people are talking over the song.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I think that's why.  Try it again.  There's chaos in this studio.  Try it again.  I know.  This is Hulkster in Heaven.  I read it in the papers.  I saw it on TV.  That's Bober.  That's John Valby.  When I wrestle is when we leave.  Is it? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I hear it.  Have you ever seen that guy?  He should be funny.  But now you turn my heart.  It's funny here.  That's John Valby?  That's Hulk Hogan.  That's John Valby.  Whatever it is, it's horrible.  Just keep it off.  I think we can all agree with that.  Definitely John Valby.  David wants to say something.  David, what's up?  David!  Yo!  Hey, man.  What a mess.  And Bubba Ray just said we're the greatest radio show ever, and now we're screwing it up.  That's because we're a mess.  David.  Yes.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  How you doing?  Yes.  What's up?  I have my wife.  She'll have full sex right now for four tickets. 
[01:22:00]  We have both of you and Bubba Ray.  Matter of fact, we're all three.  All right.  We're not even worth continuing.  Didn't it say sister-in-law will strip?  Dumped.  And then he gets on and talks about phone sex.  Yeah.  Ass man, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  No, I just want to give Bubba Ray his props, you know.  Hey, is this the ass man?  Yes, the ass man.  Hey, Jim.  Let me tell you something.  There are very few things that have stuck out in my mind over my years of wrestling. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  This guy is one of them.  Oh, really?  His ass is tremendous.  Oh, you've seen this guy?  Yeah.  He used to get tickets to the front row when we were in ECW, and he'd be hanging out there.  If he was taking a chick from behind, he could double park his belly on her back.  That's how fat he is.  You know, he got his stomach stapled up.  He did?  Yep.  So you're thin now?  You look like Carney Wilson?  Yes.  On my way.  How many pounds have you lost after that?  I've lost up to about 100 pounds so far.  Oh, good for you.  You've got a lot. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yeah?  This guy, even though he's a douche, he was a loyal fan, you know, which is cool.  He spread his ass cheeks, I mean, like 10 feet away from me one night.  I felt gravity sucking me into his bunghole.  I thought I was going to die.  The mass.  Yeah.  We had a girl try to find his junk once on our show.  She could not find it.  Yeah.  We had a girl.  It was so embarrassing.  He dropped trowel, and she looked, and she was horrified at first.  We didn't want to look, so Rick drew a picture of what it looked like, and it looked like she said it was like womanly in the way that it had skin kind of wrapping around the area. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God.  And that everything had retracted up to himself, and it was kind of like a woman.  Yeah.  It must smell like a sub.  What?  What, like a Hammond Swiss?  Yeah.  Well, Ashman, now that you've lost all of this weight, have you had any luck with the ladies? 
[01:24:00]  Not yet.  I can't admit that I have, but I'm still trying.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, you know, you can always go buy one.  Yeah.  Well, you know, not from lack of time.  I have gone out and purchased the services of women other night.  Oh, you've gotten some hookers?  Boy, that must be a treat.  Allegedly.  Hey, I tell you what, you know what, since you've been coming to so many shows, you want  some tickets for tonight?  No, I'm at work right now.  You sure?  I'll give you free tickets.  I can't.  Why wasn't he going to give them to you anyway, so shut up? 
[01:24:30]  Did you ask me?  What were you going to ask?  No, it's always good to see, you know, Bubba Ray doing all the stuff that he's doing at ECW.  You think what he does now is, you know, out there.  What he did at ECW shows, he was like ten times just the total awesomeness.  It's just what he used to do.  I mean, just leap in and tables and chairs and raises and ball boy and stuff like that.  It was just amazing what he used to do.  I mean, not that what he does now is any less amazing, but what he did at ECW was even, 
[01:25:00]  you know, better than, you know, what he does now.  Get a glove on yourself, you over-explaining ass.  I'm glad the children are here to hear that explained in its original old Western gibberish.  You know what, from the vibe I'm getting from him, if he was at the studio right now,  he would be performing Felicio on me.  I'd be going from you, thanks.  Thank you.  All right, ass man, thanks.  There he goes.  I don't know what the point of that call was, but, Alex, what's going on?  Hi, guys, what's up?  Hey. 
[01:25:30]  Bubba.  Yes.  How is it that you miraculously, about two years ago, got over your stuttering problem?  Vince said, don't stutter no more.  Miraculously, I stopped.  Kiss my ass, stop the stuttering gang, Bubba.  Don't stutter.  I like a Bubba Ray that doesn't stutter.  You guys have been going on a lot about Chuck and Billy, the tag team.  Yeah.  You ever notice, maybe you're connected to that whole C and B thing?  What?  C and B.  Chains and bondage, Chuck and Billy. 
[01:26:00]  Alex, what are you talking about?  The guys, the guy parts, the C and B.  Oh, C and B.  Ock and Alls.  Ock and Alls.  You guys get around this stuff so well.  Ock and Alls?  Yeah, I'm going to just say it.  Yeah, I know.  Just bleep me.  You know what I said.  All right, Alex.  Let me tell you something about Chuck and Billy. 
[01:26:30]  I'm saying it right now.  They are the next big tag team in the WWF.  I'm telling you, they look great together.  They have good chemistry.  Billy is going to teach Chuck.  Billy's been around a long time.  Calm down.  Vince isn't listening to us right now.  We're lying.  This is not about it.  Dude, I'm going to bitch slap you in the movie.  Look at that.  I'm going to take this issue of this cheesy, you know, rip off of Maxim magazine that I  have in the head right now.  I think they're going to be good.  All right.  I think Billy Gunn is the most underrated wrestler in the WWF.  I'm not feeling it.  Why are you getting so sick that I'm talking nice about somebody? 
[01:27:00]  I'm not feeling the Billy and Chuck.  I'm feeling Billy and Chuck.  I have felt Billy and Chuck.  I like the Dudley boys.  I like that Triple H is back.  I like the what?  I like the rock.  Cool.  Undertaker cut his hair.  It's all good.  Give these guys a chance.  Hey, Billy was one half of the most successful tag team in WWF history.  Right.  Got to give the guy a chance.  It's his new thing.  Just because he's swinging to the other side of the fence right now, don't make him a bad  guy.  All right.  We're waiting for Daniela to come down. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  She's going to do the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge, the first one of the new year, and she's going  to get the Smackdown tickets.  This is a bid.  It's not going to work.  Watch.  Watch this.  Oh, he wants to be wacky.  So we'll do it.  Watch this.  Wacky alert.  Hi, who's this?  What's up, man?  Hey.  I'm out of the studio.  I'm waiting for that guy.  He said if I come down, I can fight him.  So I'm here, man.  What about it?  You want to fight Bubba Ray?  Yeah, man.  I'm right outside the door, man.  Wacky bid alert.  Wacky alert.  Yeah? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, where is he?  I'm on my way down.  Is that a big guy that's standing there in the corner?  Hey, yo, come here, Bubba Ray, you big guy.  Come on, fight.  Come on, big guy.  Where are you?  I'm here.  Is that you in the corner?  Is that the big guy in the corner, Bubba Ray?  Do I got tough?  Come on, Bubba Ray.  Yeah, that's a good bit.  Listen to this.  Oh, God.  He's on the floor.  Holy Jesus.  There is nothing he can do.  Paul is frigging on the floor in two seconds. 
[01:28:30]  He is done.  Who made this day?  Who made this day?  Who made this day?  He's choking him out.  He's done.  Say it, Paul.  You better say it or you'll die.  Say it.  You're going to go.  You're going to go.  He's choking him out.  He's choking him out.  He's choking him out.  Dude, he enjoys this stuff.  He's the craziest son of a bitch in the WWF. 
[01:29:00]  He is insane.  Why would you ever mess with Bubba Ray Douglas?  Did you see how quick, like a viper, the guy struck, pulled him down, it was over.  It was effing over in two seconds.  Paul was outside the studio door looking in, Bubba Ray turned around, saw him, and within  two seconds had him out.  It was like, I swear to God, it was like watching a goddamn nature show.  You know what it is?  You ever see the crocodile grab the water buffalo near the river? 
[01:29:30]  Like it creeps up.  It's real slow.  And you're like, how is that animal going to grab the water buffalo moving like that?  And then it just goes, thwog, and it's over.  Two seconds notice wouldn't hurt me at all.  You're real.  You were done.  You know what sounded funny?  Your phone call.  Yeah, tell him to, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You got not the M out.  Hey, it's all it's true.  Wow.  That's funny.  Dude, how did that feel? 
[01:30:00]  Let me tell you.  Whoever was going to come down, that's one strong SOB, man.  Hell yeah.  Even worse, he's fat.  Once he's sitting, you can't get up.  You were done.  You're calling him fat?  I'm calling him fat.  No, I don't think I called you fat.  Who did?  He called you fat.  I didn't call you.  No, I don't take your jacket off.  Dude, see?  Now I'm sticking up.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What is he saying?  I can drag you in here, put you on your back.  I don't want to give you a fig.  I just put you on your back. 
[01:30:30]  I'm fat for doing that?  I just kicked your ass.  No, wait a minute.  I said you were strong.  I'm going to do it again right now.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Run!  Run!  No, dude, run.  Run!  That was the visual radio that nobody saw.  That is the smartest thing I've ever seen Paul do.  He just dropped to the floor under his own power.  He dropped to his knees and opened up his mouth.  Daniel, where are you?  Bubble Ray?  No.  I said whoever was coming down was stupid. 
[01:31:00]  I said you're strong.  I said, but one, two, one.  Why are you shivering?  He is shaking.  I'm three, one of my cups.  I'm 315 pounds.  Of course it's going to feel like I'm crushing you.  I'm a freaking wrestler, for Christ's sake.  What are you doing for a living?  Nothing.  Okay.  Paul, put your hand out.  Look at his hand.  He's shivering.  He's shivering.  I just had a moose lay on me.  My lungs are shut.  He's shaking.  No offense.  He's a nice moose.  Hey, Andy, don't get me in any more trouble.  Hey, Paul, just shut your mouth. 
[01:31:30]  If you notice something, there is a consistent thing that happens every time Bubba shows up.  I treat him with nothing but the utmost respect, because the last thing I would want to be is on the receiving end of anything close to that.  When he took off that jacket and hat, that was just awful.  No, don't mess with Norton.  Norton will crap himself.  He struck him so fast.  The speed is what killed me. 
[01:32:00]  He grabbed him, and he was on the floor.  Done.  See, end of story in the snap of a finger.  That was it.  Classic.  That is so great to watch someone else.  Our fun for the day is over.  It's so funny when it's not you.  You've got to know when to keep your mouth shut.  Oh, absolutely.  Somebody asked me if you could come back reincarnated or something.  I said, I want to come back as a killer whale.  That's what it looked like.  And he was a baby seal.  You were just batting it around.  He was my bitch baby seal.  Batting it around.  You notice I've kept my wiseacre comments to a minute. 
[01:32:30]  Exactly.  I just got called back to the arena, so I just got a call on cell phone.  Actually, my phone was ringing.  I heard that.  As I was beating the crap out of the person.  He was able to take a call and beat him up at the same time.  He's kicking someone's ass, and he's taking calls.  Hello.  Yeah, I'll be at the arena.  Brother Ray.  Sell if it gets to 50.  So, in the midst of everything, let me get my one more cheap plug-in.  Smackdown tonight at Madison Square Garden, live on Thursday nights on UPN and WWF Monday Night Raw. 
[01:33:00]  On TNN, the Royal Rumble, two Sundays from now.  And I think every Opie and Anthony Lisser out there who's going to be at the Garden tonight would like to see you guys there.  Yeah.  Why don't you come?  I'll go.  Give me two tickets.  I will go.  This is the ninth time I've been on your show.  I just said I'll go.  Shut up.  You think for once that you guys come to our show?  I know.  I'm going.  Okay, cool.  I'll go.  Who do I talk to?  Vince.  He hasn't talked to us. 
[01:33:30]  Speak to that guy without the PR guy that they sent down with me to keep me out of trouble.  I'll go.  All right.  I'll be there tonight.  I will be there tonight.  All right?  Definitely.  Take care, guys.  Thanks for having me on again.  Thanks, Barbara.  You rock, man.  Also, if you are going to the show tonight at the Garden, it will air on Smackdown on Thursday,  they take it tonight, best O&A-related show sign, will win a trip to the Royal Rumble.  Yes.  Okay?  You got to beat last night's sign, which was a big, wow, O&A-1027 sign.  Don't let that guy shoot me either. 
[01:34:00]  No.  If you have a string sign there, that'll be hysterical.  Holy.  Wow.  Holy jeez.  Wow.  Did you see Paul's face was red like a beat?  He was done.  I think Steve got some of that on video.  On the floor.  You got it all on video?  Done.  The funniest thing is I've got the video camera pointed at Paul outside the door,  and then a split second later, it's like a Roadrunner cartoon.  Whoosh.  He's in the studio.  Snatched him up.  He just snatched him.  Dragged him into the studio. 
[01:34:30]  Flung him on the floor.  Got on top of him.  That was it.  See, a lot of people could have had his way with him.  A lot of people think it's cute to mess with wrestlers.  Yeah.  You're insane.  You think it's all fun and games and cute.  How insane would Crazy Paul do that?  Here's what was scary.  There was scarier in this.  When he grabbed him, you know, the guy, because he knows he's kidding,  but when he took off his hat and his glasses,  it's like even though you knew he wasn't really going to hurt the guy  because it wasn't a real fight, like that is a scary white dude.  Oh, yeah.  That's like he looked like that's the fight.  If you see that face in a bar, you immediately kneel and undo a zipper. 
[01:35:00]  He almost had Paul doing that.  That rocks.  He's a frightening dude.  That rocks.  Very cool.  I'm a girly man anyway.  I'm afraid of most larger men, but he is like, oh.  Do we have those four tickets?  Do you leave them behind?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're right here.  If Danielle comes down and does a Whiffle Ball Bad Challenge,  she's going to the show tonight.  Yes.  All right.  And once again, just a quick plug, the best O&A show related sign that we see tonight on TV.  It's got to make it on TV. 
[01:35:30]  We'll vote tomorrow.  We'll get a free trip to the Royal Rumble.  On the way out.  Or two.  I'm sorry.  On the way out, Paul said to him, you know, that was just a goof.  And Brother Ray said to him, I know, if it wasn't a goof, you wouldn't be breathing.  Oh, wow.  Opie and Anthony.  We're a bunch of perverted crackers.  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W. 
[01:36:00]  Anthony, Sam Adams.  We love Sam Adams.  Mm-mm-mm.  Yeah.  We did.  We did.  We just got our fresh delivery in.  Did you see how happy everybody was?  I came walking in.  I saw the boxes and boxes of Sam Adams sitting in our office.  Cases stacked up.  And now, you know what a great relationship we have with the Ron and Fez show?  Here.  The only possible rift we have, what does it involve?  Beer.  Our beer.  Our Sam Adams. 
[01:36:30]  Some of their peeps came over and wanted half of our supply of Sam Adams.  Now, normally, anything Ron and Fez want, we go, yeah, sure.  This time, we're like, no.  We're taking three quarters.  You get a quarter.  And that's what we did.  Making deals within the family.  We got to get, well, things got to be kept in perspective.  I think we're drinking a lot of the Sam Adams.  We love it.  Those guys are in AA.  What do they need beer for?  Best keep the alcohol away from their show.  That's right.  We're being responsible.  We can handle our booze.  Sam Adams. 
[01:37:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  All right, lots going on on the show today.  Waiting for Daniella to show up to take the whiffle ball back challenge.  First girl of the new year.  Did you see that videotape?  Yeah, we got a great videotape of Crazy Paul getting choked out by Bubba Ray Dudley from the WWF.  It looks like a cartoon.  Steve got the perfect shot.  It's Crazy Paul standing outside the studio door talking. 
[01:37:30]  And it's from the back.  And he's just videotaping him talking.  You see the door fly open.  You see this big, meaty hand grab his shirt and start pulling him into the studio.  Kind of like a...  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Paul tries to back off and get away.  The other hand comes out and grabs him behind the neck.  His whole body just gets instantly pulled right into the studio.  Kind of like the whale and the seal. 
[01:38:00]  Paul was the seal just being all...  Oh, this is a fun little swim.  It happens so fast.  Next thing you know, you're underwater dying.  That's great.  Well, Bubba Ray knows who to go after and who not to go after.  Oh, you're talking...  You know something?  You better watch it because that guy will turn the frigging car around.  You'll sit here and you'll just be sitting here in 15 minutes and thinking nothing of it.  He'll charge through the door and smash you on the floor.  You won't know what hit you.  You didn't let me finish. 
[01:38:30]  What?  No one says I'm not one of the ones he shouldn't go after.  Oh.  Please.  I'm probably the first one.  You better keep that.  In a room full of men, I'm the first one you should smash.  No.  You know, I would collapse.  He's the type of guy, though.  Like a bowl of placenta.  No, he's the type of guy, though.  He would be bored with you.  He would go for the strongest individual.  He would only go for me.  He would go right for the strongest guy.  I'm telling you.  Look, I know.  That's why I'm glad to be here.  You would be safe.  You would be safe.  No, I wouldn't be.  He would do it.  You'd be a little appetizer.  A little shrimp. 
[01:39:00]  Mark, what's going on?  How you doing?  All right.  Do you want her to come up or what?  Who?  My girl.  What's your girl?  My girl.  Her name is Cindy.  I mean, we've seen her do it plenty of times before.  I mean, me and my boy should be doing it anyway.  Mark, come up and do what?  Who's Cindy?  The Whiffle Ball Bad Challenge.  I mean, does that girl, Danielle, come down yet?  Who's Cindy?  My girlfriend.  How old is she?  She's 24.  And she wants to do the Whiffle Ball Bad? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  I mean, if you want, we can have one of her friends come up, too, and do it, too.  Well, go get them.  Go get them both?  No, I'm saying to Rick, go get them.  Mark, where are you outside?  I'm at the payphone.  Ron and Fez rule!  That was so obviously a goofball.  Yeah, yeah, I know, because he's like, I'm here.  I'm at the payphone.  I'm there.  This chick, two chicks.  But then a Ron and Fez rule?  That guy was just plain wacky.  I think he was being zany. 
[01:40:00]  We'd be the first to tell you that Ron and Fez rule, so that doesn't make any sense.  This is the wrong show to call and give one of those to.  What a confused little gent.  All right, Dr. Smith's on the line.  Dr. Smith?  Yes.  Oh, dear.  I love Jane Lost in Space.  Hello.  Yes.  Young boy, yes.  William?  Hello, Dr. Smith?  Hello.  Hello.  How are you today? 
[01:40:30]  Why don't you tell our listeners what you do?  I'm an osteopathic physician.  I do natural wellness in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Yes, indeed you do.  You have a book out, do you?  No, not a book.  What do you have?  A product.  Woo!  A product?  Yes.  You're a doctor?  I sure am.  I am, too, Dr. Smith.  You're a doctor of what?  I never really knew.  What type of doctor was I? 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  A pediatrician?  Yes.  A gynecologist?  Oh, dear.  Spare me the poisonous barbs, Dr. Smith.  Dr. Smith, do you know who Dr. Smith is?  I certainly do.  Yes.  What's your product, sir?  It's a mood product.  It's called Golden Mood.  Golden Mood?  Yes.  Are you sure you're not a dentist?  Because this is going to be like pulling teeth.  No, it's called Golden Mood. 
[01:41:30]  It's for people who have the blues.  Are you taking this product?  Yes, I am.  Well, geez, there's an endorsement.  Give some to Major West.  He's such a prick to me.  That was what?  I didn't catch that.  It says here, doctor, that more people die from medical mistakes each year than from highway accidents.  Is that statistically true?  Yes, it is. 
[01:42:00]  Who cares?  Well, I don't get it, though.  Everything I've read that Rick has given us about you, Dr. Smith, has to do with medical mistakes and whatnot.  But then, the first thing you mention is this product.  Yes.  Is it an antidepressant?  Pardon me?  Is it an antidepressant?  Look at Rick.  Rick is now going, oh, no, I'm so dead. 
[01:42:30]  Is Golden Mood an antidepressant?  It's more of a mood support product.  You could say that it has herbals in it that work as an antidepressant.  Big Kev, do you have a guest for us?  The guy in the suit, maybe?  Maybe the guy in the Lost in Space suit?  I probably could call him.  Wasn't it May?  Bob May.  Bob May.  It says, are meds killing your sex drive?  Does this help with that, Golden Mood? 
[01:43:00]  Help with your sex drive?  Yes.  It's a guy killing our show.  But it won't kill your sex drive.  No, no, I'm saying because I've noticed that my sex drive has been down,  and I'm trying to get substitute teaching jobs to get it going again.  No, I don't think it'll help with your sex drive.  So what does it do?  It's a mood support product for people who have problems with depression-type problems.  Rather than going on strong antidepressants, 
[01:43:30]  they can go on something a little mellower like the Golden Mood.  How does it work?  At the edge of the edge.  Yeah, I know.  I wasn't paying attention to that.  Dr. Smith, you sound depressed.  You sound like a robot.  You're on this product, and it doesn't seem to be perking you up.  It doesn't perk me up?  No.  No, Dr. Smith.  What medication are you taking, Dr. Smith?  I don't take any medications.  Aren't you taking your Golden Mood product? 
[01:44:00]  Yes, I am.  Warning, warning.  This product increases boredom on radio programs.  Warning, warning.  You have the energy of a rock.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  You know, our Dr. Smith used to do things where we wanted to leave him on a planet.  Right now, I'm thinking I want you on another planet.  Please, Dr. Smith.  Do something exciting.  I think I feel like I'm on another planet. 
[01:44:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Back to the Jupiter 2.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  You suck.  Thank you.  I mean, you're on a radio show.  It is a medium for speaking.  You drone on and on.  Like a bloody answer from the planet, Furyaton. 
[01:45:00]  Warning, warning.  This is time.  We will never get back.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  Have you ever been on the radio before?  Let's start there.  I sure have.  This is sort of a new experience.  Where's young William?  Have you slipped him a Mickey?  You have your own radio show.  I do.  Ha, ha, ha.  Even the robot's laughing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Don't give anyone a radio show, huh?  Yeah, that's true. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, if you pay some money, they'll give you one.  Ah, waddle doodle.  I understand.  Just like me, the grease man.  Warning.  Doug from Springfield wants to know if he's on the Zoloft from keeping from boring us all.  Dr. Smith, do you realize you are not that exciting?  Absolutely.  I'm a pretty exciting guy.  I guess I'm slightly intimidated.  What do you do for excitement there, Doc?  What do I do?  Yeah.  Um, go to theater and go skiing and... 
[01:46:00]  What kind of theater?  Go gambling.  Oh, we have some pretty nice theater stuff in Cincinnati.  A lot of the Broadway stuff comes here.  We took a gamble on this booking and lost.  What was the last...  What was the last...  What was the last show you went to for fun?  Uh, Blast.  Did you have a blast at Blast?  It was a blast.  It was great.  I loved it.  Wow.  What a rousing endorsement for Blast. 
[01:46:30]  It's no stomp.  But it's better than the Blue Man Group.  And your ski?  Uh, a little bit.  Yeah, I have.  I haven't went...  Obviously, I haven't went yet this year, but I think probably in the spring I'll go.  Yeah, obviously, because we know all about you.  Right.  Obviously.  You failed to mention that in the last ten times we talked on the phone at home.  Were you around when Larry Flint got shot in Cincinnati?  Uh, no, I wasn't here then.  He did get shot there, though, right?  Um, I don't know if he got shot in Cincinnati. 
[01:47:00]  I know he's got some hustler stores here.  Ah.  In the area.  Pornography.  So, how could you die from your medication?  From my medication?  Not your medication.  Oh.  From medication.  Taking too many pills.  Wow, you are really breaking some ground with that statement.  Too bad you couldn't talk to Marilyn Monroe.  You idiot.  We could have saved Janice and Jimmy.  Holy ass. 
[01:47:30]  You could die if you take too many pills, kids.  Dr. Earl, is your product being sold successfully over the Internet, or can people get it in stores?  It's sold over the phone.  Oh, yeah?  It's mail order.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, how would one go about getting your product?  Uh, there's an 800 number they can call.  Oh, what's the 800 number?  888-248-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668-668. 
[01:48:00]  Wait, wait, what?  Dr. Smith?  Yes.  Dr. Smith, we were losing your communication.  Yeah, what happened?  We wanted you to give out that 1-800 number for your product.  What was that number again?  888-248-611.  And this way, you will get the product. 
[01:48:30]  Dr. Smith, are you there, Dr. Smith?  Yes, I am.  Is there a problem with your phone?  You must be calling on a cell phone.  Yeah, that's it.  I'm on a cell phone.  Yeah, okay.  Hmm.  Do I detect sarcasm?  My sensors pick up sarcasm, Dr. Smith.  No, you wouldn't get any sarcasm from me.  That sounds sarcastic.  Are you a married fellow?  No, sir.  More surprises.  Ha, ha, ha, Dr. Smith.  Do you have a boyfriend? 
[01:49:00]  No, I don't.  Girlfriend?  Not really.  Dating.  Dating what?  Girls.  Another robot?  Another robot?  Ha, ha, ha.  Do you slip her a Mickey?  Ha, ha.  Well, if that's what you call it.  Very energetic.  Ugh.  You're as exciting as bone cancer.  Oh, hey. 
[01:49:30]  How long has, uh, type of comment is that?  How long has, uh, golden, um, mood been, uh, on the market?  Probably about 30 days.  Who cares?  30 days?  Are you selling a lot?  I really haven't checked yet.  I've just started doing radio interviews.  Because it says that you want to make, it's supposed to make people's mood better.  Is it a bottle with an old person falling down steps in it? 
[01:50:00]  No, but that, that might work, I suppose.  It's for some people.  Oh, you ever see an old hip bone shatter?  Cheers you right up.  What type of doctor are you?  Family practice.  Do you get to see the young ones naked?  Not anymore.  Why?  Court order.  Since the court order.  Because of the court order.  I remember Dr. Smith used to like young William.  Is that correct, Dr. Smith?  You liked young Will Robinson. 
[01:50:30]  How did you find that out?  You're a kid, such a...  I saw the episodes, Dr. Smith.  Why would the Robinson family allow a pedophile to roam around foreign planets with Dr. Smith?  Hey, we got someone on the line that has tried the product.  What is it called again, Doc?  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Warning.  And you're on it, and it peps you up, right?  Absolutely.  There's a guy, his name's West Coast Dave. 
[01:51:00]  He has tried your product.  We're in a lot of cities, sir.  So let's see what he thinks of the product.  West Coast Dave.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  I tried Dr. Smith's product, and it really, really pepped me up.  Last week, I went lawn bowling, and I find myself full of energy and pep, and I am able  to enjoy life a lot better now.  Well, that's a rousing endorsement for Dr. Smith's product.  I appreciate that.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  A great degree. 
[01:51:30]  I'm going to go throw myself off the Golden Gate Bridge now.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Well, Dave enjoys the product, Dr. Smith.  Well, I'm glad.  I'm glad it helped Dave out.  Do you have any celebrity endorsements besides Kurt Cobain?  No.  No, I don't.  Can you imagine this guy off of the product?  Is it possible I could melt those pills down for a golden shower? 
[01:52:00]  What were you like off the medication, Dr. Smith?  I was boring.  God, you should be a Canadian.  That was funny.  All right.  Ah, wow.  Wow.  All right.  Well, let me go to Alan here.  Alan.  Hello, Dr. Smith.  I have a serious question for you.  Yes.  If I use this product, Golden Mood, will it ease my bum hole after anal?  A very serious question for you. 
[01:52:30]  What is your what hole?  My bum hole.  You know, Dr. Smith, the balloon knot, the back door, the rear entry.  Um, probably, absolutely.  Absolutely, it will help.  Wow.  Now I'm excited about this product.  Later, Kid Toucher.  Dr. Smith.  Well, uh, Dr. Smith. 
[01:53:00]  Yes.  So it'll ease the pain of the back door.  Absolutely.  Everything feels better.  Eli.  On Golden Mood.  Eli.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  How are you guys doing?  Oh, good.  We're talking to Dr. Smith.  I have a problem, Dr. Smith.  Um, I get down a lot and depressed.  And sometimes the only thing that cheers me up is, uh, whacking my girlfriend a couple  of times.  I think your product, uh, I think your product will help me out. 
[01:53:30]  It'll give you the stamina that you need.  Oh.  There you go.  No problem.  I, I, I, but Doc, I think if you're beating up your, your wife, your girl,  girlfriend, you don't want stamina, you idiot.  Torture!  That's torture!  Oh, we have another call on the line.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, this is Mike Tyson.  Hey, Mike.  Hi, Dr. Smith.  Yeah, Mike.  Dr. Smith.  S-M-I-F.  I could spell that one.  Dr. Smith, can I stop taking the Zoloft and go on this and still be in a mood where I 
[01:54:00]  don't kill y'all?  Um, are you still on?  I would love to punch you in your face.  You still on your lithium, Mike?  I need the lithium and the Zoloft.  And now the golden mood.  I would take, I would, I would lay down.  I would say, thank you, Dr. Smith.  And I would take the, the golden mood, right?  I would swallow it.  I would wait till it takes effect.  And then I put my big foot up your ass.  That's what I would do. 
[01:54:30]  I would kick you so hard in your ass that you would actually maybe even for a second  get a personality.  Ha, ha, ha.  And then we all laughed.  This is awful.  I don't know.  It's pretty funny.  What, uh, made you get into, uh, looking to pioneer a golden mood if I could?  What got me into natural wellness or? 
[01:55:00]  Natural wellness.  What is natural wellness?  I've never heard that term.  I just don't use medications in my practice anymore.  It's all holistic.  It's all holistic.  Holistic medication.  Spirit, mind, and body.  But is that good for like tumors and stuff?  Um, no, I mean, there, there's, there's a place for medications.  Medications are important and they work.  Just taking too many of them.  What would you, um, uh, give a tumor?  A tumor?  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Um, what kind of a tumor?  Uh, uh, a malignant tumor?  What kind of a malignant tumor?  You have the charisma of George Harrison today.  Sir, let's just say that my rods aren't what they used to be.  Your rods aren't what they used to be?  Yeah.  Can it help with the boners?  Why am I talking on this?  Can it help with the boners?  Can it help with the boners?  Probably Viagra. 
[01:56:00]  Was that another joke?  Yeah.  Can you give him a laugh?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Doc, you're awful.  Wow.  You, I gotta tell you something.  What's that?  You are absolutely the worst radio guest we've ever had on this show.  We've been on the air together, Opie and I, for, I believe, seven some odd years.  Seven some odd years.  You are probably, and I'm not, I'm not even being wacky, probably the most boring guy we've ever spoken to. 
[01:56:30]  But you remember me.  I know.  Because I'm the worst.  I've never been the best at anything.  True.  Probably the worst.  He'll probably, um...  But, Doc, if you're going to promote a product that's going to pep you up, shouldn't you go on the radio really peppy?  Do some cocaine or smoke some crack before you do these radio interviews.  You have the energy of a sloth.  Thank you, Vito.  You working on anything else?  Holistic medicine.  Besides the golden, um... 
[01:57:00]  Are you working on a personality?  Anything like that?  Yeah, I've got other products in the making.  I guess...  What do they do?  I guess I'm going to have to do some therapy or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, at least you could give out the phone number for 18th City.  So why don't you give out the phone number for the Golden Mood?  Okay.  The Golden Mood phone number is 888-248.  Mm-hmm.  And we got operators standing by? 
[01:57:30]  Absolutely.  Dr. Smith, I have to ask you something.  Sure.  Um, you say you're a family practice?  Right.  Yet you don't prescribe any type of drugs?  Nope.  All right.  Let's...  Can we play a game?  Absolutely.  What year was Dr. Smith's license taken away?  Can we play that?  And why?  And why?  And why?  Can we play?  Yeah.  When did he get out of drug therapy himself?  Was that it?  Yeah, no.  You got a... 
[01:58:00]  You started dipping into the medicine cabinet yourself?  A little to the morphine.  Oh, need morphine.  I think there's a story with Dr. Smith.  There's some kind of story, because there's no family practice guy that doesn't prescribe  the dope.  It was at the same time when I quit doing the pelvic exams on the women.  Oh, the pelvic...  The pelvic exam.  Was there some type of touching thing that happened?  It was, you know, it was the pedophile, the drug thing, you know, it was the whole thing  at all.  It was so stressful, it just all came together at once.  Dr. Smith, I'm being serious here.  There has to be a story where, why you're not prescribing drugs to people. 
[01:58:30]  Were you ever...  Did you ever prescribe drugs to people?  Sure.  Yeah, I worked for 20 years.  20 years.  And then what happened?  Something happened.  Something happened.  What happened to change your outlook on medicine?  Well, I had to come up with one incident, I guess.  You know, you're probably right.  I lived in Branson, Missouri.  Uh-huh.  And my mom died from overuse of medication. 
[01:59:00]  Wrong guy.  Sorry to hear that, Dr. Smith.  Sorry.  I appreciate the symbol.  Wow, where's everyone going?  Over medication.  Jim is in a corner right now.  From over medication.  Right.  All right.  What was the drug of choice?  What was the drug of choice?  Like what was the ailment and what was prescribed and how did it happen?  Dear old mom.  It was just an anti-inflammatory.  You know, she just... 
[01:59:30]  Her stomach, she bled to death.  Sorry.  No, that's...  It wasn't you that prescribed it, though, right?  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  Just because that would have been...  Why was she taking the drug?  It was because of some kind of...  Arthritis.  Arthritis.  Arthritis.  Right.  Is that arthritis of the stomach?  No, arthritis.  And then she took an anti-inflammatory and I guess she was over-medicated and it caused  her stomach to bleed? 
[02:00:00]  Mm-hmm.  Did it explode?  No, it wouldn't explode.  It would just kind of bleed.  Yeah, it bleeds.  Yeah.  So did she get bloated and stuff?  No.  Why didn't anybody see this happening and maybe...  When it happens, it happens pretty quick.  Was it?  Yeah.  Well, what happens?  She just...  She bled and they tried to take her stomach out and she died on the operating table.  Wow. 
[02:00:30]  Huh.  Jeez.  So then you decided that medication was no good, right?  Huh?  Yeah.  That kind of...  Bad medication.  That kind of put you over the line?  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Here's one for the old-timers.  You mean me?  Wow.  So that...  Then you went into holistic medicine.  How old were you when your mom died, if I may ask Dr. Smith? 
[02:01:00]  45, I'll say.  45, yeah.  Hey, screw this.  The Wiffleball Batgirl's here.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Dr. Smith, thank you so much.  Okay, buddy.  You want to give out that phone number once again?  No.  Why wouldn't...  Hey, that's the best, funniest thing you've said.  Why wouldn't you want to give out the phone number?  I'm insulted.  No.  What's the matter, Dr. Smith?  You okay?  It's like Linus in the football or something, you know?  It's like I'm going to be kicking the football. 
[02:01:30]  Nope, I'm not going to do it.  Dr. Smith.  Oh, now you're going to make us feel better.  No, no, no, no.  Give it out for the plug.  Hey, what's going on Wednesday over there with this wow thing?  Wow?  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know anything about wow.  Oh, come on, guys.  You're more depressing than old yeller.  I just talked to a friend of mine in New York, and he told me that on Wednesdays you guys do a wow thing.  Really?  Yeah, whip them out Wednesday.  Girls like flash guys on the way home if they see wow in their car.  Yeah, like why couldn't you call me on Wednesday? 
[02:02:00]  Maybe that would have put me in a better mood.  You're in a bad mood?  Why?  No, I'm not in a bad mood.  Did we get off to a bad start?  No, no.  No.  I just don't.  Why don't you free your mind here?  Why don't you tell us what you think of us?  You all right?  What do I think of you guys?  You all right?  You all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're a lot of fun.  You sound a little...  It sounds like you're going to take a warm bath and slit your wrists after you hang up the phone.  You have any friends, Dr. Smith?  Sort of like the airplane movie, you know? 
[02:02:30]  Hanging yourself, cutting your wrist.  Huh?  Do I have any friends?  Yeah, you got any friends?  I think I got a couple.  That's good.  All right.  You get laid?  You said he's dating, Ope.  It hasn't been real recent I haven't gotten laid, no.  You want us to get you laid?  Out in New York?  Yeah.  Eh, you know.  You made up that over-medicating story, right?  She died from boredom of one of your visits.  I'm not even a doctor.  You're not?  You what?  I'm not even a doctor.  Then why are you Dr. Smith? 
[02:03:00]  Well, I had to come up with something.  Hold the phone.  Well, you're doing...  You said that you practiced 20 years and you were an emergency room doctor.  I know, but Dr. Smith couldn't take the call and he asked me to come in here and sit and talk on the phone.  Said there were a couple of jerks from New York calling me and he wanted to...  So he's trying to be whacking.  I think you're lying, Dr. Smith.  No, I'm not.  You're Dr. Smith.  No, no, no, I'm not.  Dr. Smith would never have somebody else come on when he has something to talk about. 
[02:03:30]  That's right.  He was busy and he just asked me to come on and sit here and...  I give you credit.  It's a good out.  I like it.  Okay.  I like it.  I don't want people to think that you really are a bore because you want people to buy your product.  I understand all that.  That's okay.  And then...  Kirksville College?  And the mom's death thing, pretty sad.  That was sad.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, thank you, Dr. Smith.  Okay, guys.  Good luck with the product.  You sure you don't want to give the number out again?  I really feel bad now. 
[02:04:00]  And you know what?  Ant and I...  Ant, we like to goof around, but when it's over and done with, we like to make good.  So...  Yeah.  All right.  I'm just serious.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dr. Smith, you were a good sport.  You took our abuse.  You took everything we threw at you.  You didn't hang up.  You hung in there.  You're a good guy.  So we got our fun out of you, and now we should make good.  Okay, you ready?  The phone number.  But before.  Oh. 
[02:04:30]  So I got the first six numbers before.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Say the whole number.  You heard me.  I didn't play any sound effects.  Eight, eight, eight.  Eight.  Eight, eight, eight.  Right.  Go ahead.  I didn't do nothing yet.  Two, four, eight.  Right. 
[02:05:00]  Dr. Smith?  Yes, sir?  Do you want Mr. DVD's phone number?  You guys could have a blast together.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, Dr. Smith.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  There he is.  New pal, Dr. Smith.  Dr. Smith.  We better keep in touch with that guy.  I like him.  He's going to kill himself soon.  Woo!  Woo!  Party radio with Dr. Smith.  That was some of the most uncomfortable radio I've ever heard.  You actually left your seat and walked into the corner when Obie played the canned laughter 
[02:05:30]  over the mom's part.  That was probably the worst use of canned laughter I've ever, ever heard.  All right.  Well, the girl that wants to do the wiffle ball med challenge for the SmackDown tickets is here.  Bravo.  So, and we still got to talk about our virginity contest.  And, well, wait, Russ wants to say something.  Russ, what's up?  Man, I know you go for the cringe radio thing, but with the mom on the operating table and 
[02:06:00]  taking out the stomach, oh, you're going to hell, guys.  You are all going straight down.  Sorry, sorry.  Oh, man.  I'm so sorry, guys.  He rules.  You can't refuse the effort.  Jordan, you rule.  Thanks, man.  Later.  Okay.  Bye.  Oh.  Goddamn up-tempo number after a mom dying. 
[02:06:30]  Linus in the football.  Linus in the football.  Very good analogy from the very boring Dr. Smith.  I'm not Dr. Smith.  Except it's Charlie Brown.  I know.  I know.  But I didn't want to correct it.  It's so funny.  It's just like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  Then he's like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  That guy was...  Hey, Rick, great job.  Rick, great booking.  Great booking.  Great booking, Rick.  Thank God we could go with just about anything with this radio program. 
[02:07:00]  First edition, bad guest.  Imagine a real radio show that had to have him on.  What would they do?  So tell us more about your prep.  It's a new structure thing.  Today is Autistic Tuesday.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to know.  He's so full of energy and so vibrant.  Has he ever considered promotions for WNEW? 
[02:07:30]  No.  Good job, Rick.  You're cool.  Hey, guys, not a listener is mocking Rick over his bookings.  Well, it was a good booking.  It was.  That was.  Bravo.  Because we flipped it.  As they say in the hood, we flipped it.  Do you know something?  Oh, I knew in the first two words out of his mouth, uh-oh.  We are in trouble now.  I thought that we've had doctors on this show that we've spoken to.  Remember the doctor that told the emergency room stories?  Oh, yeah.  He was an emergency room doctor.  Dr. Mark Brown.  He spun a story. 
[02:08:00]  It was great.  It was very interesting to listen to.  He told one story about how a woman was psycho and she wanted a baby.  And she wound up going to the hospital with abdominal pains.  They examined her.  She had sewn her area shut.  And when they cut the sewing open and took a look, she had put chicken parts there thinking that it would turn into a baby.  Of a baby.  And there were plenty of stories like that.  So it's not just, oh, my God, you're booking a doctor on the show. 
[02:08:30]  I knew within two words, oh, we are in trouble with this guy.  Chicken parts?  Chicken parts.  Can you imagine the stench?  Ah, it's unimaginable.  The stench must have been great.  Uncle John.  Wonderful.  That ranked right up there with Has Been Corner.  Yeah.  That was great.  Fool me once, shame on me.  See you guys.  How many people are like, no, doc, just hang up, hang up.  We roped them in. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  For one more phone plug.  All right, Uncle John.  We should do a smell contest.  What?  Just popped in my brain when he said, can you imagine what that smelled like?  We should get some of the most ranked stuff.  Yeah.  And see who could, you know, smell the series of things that we bring into the studio, or  we might have to do it somewhere else without puking.  Last guy standing wins.  It's going to be hard to get your nose by Voss's website.  Or your butt, with what's been popping out of there all day. 
[02:09:30]  I left the studio for the last one.  The daver farts.  The last burst of air that comes out of a corpse in the funeral home.  Why don't we take a break?  Danielle, her name's Danielle, right?  Yeah.  She's going to try to win the SmackDown tickets next with the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious amusements and outright horror. 
[02:10:00]  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and thrish.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Yeah, we're back.  You can't bring us down.  I don't know that Dr. Smith interview.  I think we showed off our interviewing skills.  Yeah, some people have criticized us on our interviewing skills, Opie.  We're not the interviewers that maybe some other people on the radio are. 
[02:10:30]  I think right there we proved it.  How's that for tavern talk?  You douche.  Tony, what's going on?  Yo, Opie.  Yeah.  You are probably one of the most romantic, cruelest people I've ever heard in my life.  I changed the station.  It was so cool what you did to that guy.  I didn't do anything.  Oh, come on with the laughing about his mother dying and stuff in the background.  I'm like, actually, the first time I actually ever changed the station, you guys like doing that for years.  You are so sick, man. 
[02:11:00]  You are a sick mother effer girl.  I didn't do the laughing.  It was from an old vaudeville show.  Well, whatever it was, it was just I had to change the station.  You know what it was?  I think I was going to be feel guilty that I would have laughed.  I had to change the station, and then I came back, and the bit was over.  But I'll tell you something.  You're just a sick mother effer girl.  All right.  Also, wait, wait, Anthony.  Yeah.  Real quick.  The other day, I was watching the Croc Hunter, and he made a Mike Tyson reference.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  This is what he said.  I swear to God.  He goes, there was camels running around.  He goes, well, if you get hit by one of these guys, it'll feel like getting punched by Mike Tyson. 
[02:11:30]  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.  Great Aussie accent there, Tony.  Dude, you got to do like a little Mike and the Crocodile guy thing.  You know, you can go back and forth.  I would if there wasn't a girl that was ready to shove a wiffle ball.  I want to let you know.  I was hysterical.  I thought you guys were cracking up.  The guy's hilarious, but his publicist is a twat.  I didn't know that when he hung up on you guys.  That was so lame.  Yeah, we were having fun with the Croc Hunter, too.  And she was cool with it, too, with the little Crocs and the big Crocs, and then she comes 
[02:12:00]  on the phone, and she's like, we got to go, and he hangs up.  What was that?  In the call, click.  All right.  Yeah.  But anyway, if you could just do something like that later, that was the funniest thing  with the Croc.  He said, yeah, it would be like a Mike Tyson punch.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Make it easy, guys.  Woo!  That's up there with anything Pryor's ever said.  The voice alone was just, ha, ha, ha.  Dan, what's going on?  Hello?  What's up, Dan?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I'm just stomach bleeding, always funny.  God damn.  All right, enough. 
[02:12:30]  Enough.  Hey.  Thank you.  All right, let's move on, all right?  Frank, you're next on the O.P. Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got something you need to get for the smell contest.  Do you guys want to do the smell contest?  That'd be cool.  I mean, we haven't even really thought it over, but it just kind of popped, popped into  our brains here.  What do you suggest for the smell contest?  It's called shrimp paste.  Oriental peepee.  Oh, yeah.  We had some of that stuff for the...  55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to mess with that stuff.  Disgusting.  You got to wear rubber gloves when you mess with that S.  Really bad.  I got the goose bumpies there.  We used to use that on baseball trips.  You put it in the other kids' rooms.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I think we might do this contest.  We'll have a whole, like, table of things that our contestants have to smell, and we'll  see who's standing.  They'll have to sit out for a couple of days and make them spit their face in that.  We'll supply the food so there's food in their stomach.  Uh-huh.  Make them drink a lot of whatever, and then they start smelling. 
[02:13:30]  You know, the big pile of crap has got to be...  It's got to be the most rank stuff ever.  Norton's ass.  Got a hamburger butt.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Dallas.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  This is Scott.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul.  I was wondering, what do I need to do to get the show started before 10 p.m.?  In Dallas?  Yeah, because I'll try and listen to it, and I've got to stay up until, like, 2 a.m. 
[02:14:00]  every single weeknight.  Well, the station's got to wake up and fire that blubbermouth Likas.  Lik-ass is what I call them.  Well, yeah.  Me and my friends.  It'll happen someday when we start getting ratings.  I hope so, man.  All right.  We're trying to get some stuff started here.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Well, we've got the girl that wants to do the wiffle ball back challenge, Anthony.  Yeah, what's this all about now?  It's Daniela or Danielle or...  Daniela.  What?  Daniela.  All right.  Let's bring her in, man.  All right.  That's sexy.  We've got tickets to SmackDown tonight at the Garden really fast. 
[02:14:30]  Bubba Ray was in.  We had a lot of fun with him.  We're doing the sign contest last night to get in on that.  We'll see the results Thursday when SmackDown airs on TV, Anthony.  Yes.  Basically, the best O&A-related sign on live TV between yesterday and SmackDown will win  a trip to the Royal Rumble, okay?  There you go.  We definitely have a leader.  The guy had a big wow O&A 1027 sign last night.  Not big.  It was probably, what, three feet by three feet?  That was very visual.  It was nice. 
[02:15:00]  So if you beat that, you got a trip or two to the Royal Rumble in Atlanta, I believe.  God damn, Stinky.  What did Stinky say?  I've just seen him snapping on the gloves.  Oh.  He's amazing like that.  Oh, you're hot.  She's hot.  Sir, I almost didn't recognize you not attacking Peter Sellers.  That's her buddy that is with her there.  There you go.  Do you understand his reference, sir? 
[02:15:30]  Not exactly, but...  Not exactly, but, you know, just rolling with the punches.  There you go.  You like the show?  Hell yeah.  I listen every day.  Close the show?  He loves the show.  Cool.  And are you banging this?  No, everyone else thinks I am.  No, best friends.  Best friends.  Ah, damn.  Couldn't close the deal today, right?  No guy ever goes into a relationship thinking they're going to be best friends.  Yeah.  How bad do you want her?  He wanted...  How bad do you want her?  Pretty bad.  Oh, now it's kind of weird now, you know what I mean? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, it would be weird right until it goes...  As friends, what do you guys do?  What do you guys do as friends?  I don't...  I can't...  I can't understand...  We watch porn together.  Oh, God damn.  That's torture, right?  You watch...  Dude, that's torture.  Do you give him a handy or something?  No.  Oh, Christ.  You've got to help the guy out.  What kind of friend are you?  If you're sitting there watching porn, put it this way.  He's raging.  Waiting.  Why would you watch porn with this hot chick and not get anything, sir?  Can't close the deal.  Can't close the deal, I guess. 
[02:16:30]  Oof.  God, that sucks.  What other things do you guys do as friends?  Go to the movies?  Go see Harry Potter?  No, no.  Harry Potter?  Can we talk about a contest?  No.  You have a contest?  You have a contest.  What's the contest?  Should we?  Yeah.  Well, now you have to.  Well...  No, actually, whenever we hang out, when we meet new friends, we look for young girls  that we can corrupt.  I like that.  And to do other things.  Oh, yeah?  Like what?  So far, we got one girl to get pregnant and get an abortion. 
[02:17:00]  Holy cow.  Wow.  Hey, that's a great contest idea for the O&A show.  How old was she?  She was 19.  Oh, I think she said young.  Get pregnant and get an abortion.  All right.  I'm speechless.  Your wheels are...  I see the wheels moving in your head.  I ain't touching that one.  That's great.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  And you thought this would just be a fun idea?  Yeah.  A fun thing to do?  You didn't get her pregnant, did you?  No.  No.  Who got her pregnant?  This guy, she was kind of dating. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  And did the guy know that you guys were playing this cute little gag on her?  No.  No one knows.  Well, now everyone knows.  She thinks.  Well, they all think that we all don't know, but we all know.  Ah.  So she purposely...  Oh, my God.  That's pretty twisted.  All right.  What'd she win?  What'd she win?  What other kind of games?  Well, we're working on one girl right now.  Yeah?  Her name is Gabby.  To do what?  Well, she's getting pretty far, I would say.  We take her to some parties, and she's gotten pretty far.  Yeah, you know.  She's into giving the Hummers. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, okay.  So is it how many she could give in one night or something, or how many?  Well, we get to how many people.  So far, we got, what, two?  Two.  Two people?  Good thing you didn't bring Gabby along to the O&A show.  He's laughing at you, man.  You want something there, Norton.  Let me go to...  Let me go to...  Tonka has a question.  Tonka?  Yes.  You have to come apart like that.  What's up, Tonka?  I was wondering if she works part-time at his Chinese laundry. 
[02:18:30]  Your ancient Chinese secret, huh?  I think he's...  Wait, wait.  I'm going to guess what you are.  I'm going to guess.  He's not Chinese.  You're...  Oh, nice try, Rondai.  No.  You're Chinese?  No.  I was going to say Korean, but then I realized the Koreans, they have more circles to their  eyes.  What?  They're more circular.  You're insane.  Koreans' eyes are more circular than the Chinese.  Stop it.  Japanese, the...  Yeah.  Japanese, the most circular of all. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, right?  You're a mad person.  You want to make a bet?  He has a point.  He has a point.  Japanese have the roundest eyes of the Asians, then it's the Koreans.  Koreans call us the Chinese, though.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Is the bat just about ready there?  Oh, my gosh.  How am I going to do that?  Kelly, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  Am I on hold still?  No, you're on the radio.  Oh, gosh.  All right.  Well, my friend, Kalen, wants to give you a six o'clock queef. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, look at that, six o'clock.  Holy cow, it's six o'clock.  Does it sound good?  Hold on.  Hell yeah.  We're out.  Okay.  Well...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We weren't ready for the six o'clock queef.  You weren't?  Now we are.  Hold on.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart, it's six o'clock,  it's time for a queef.  We're playing a ball, we're playing a ball, we're playing a ball, we're playing a ball.  The candles make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish, it's six o'clock, it's  time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor, dance up and let yourself roar, queef. 
[02:20:00]  All right, Kelly, what's the name of your friend?  My friend's name is Kalen.  And she's...  She's a little nervous, so I'm talking for her.  All right, that's fine.  Well, we don't need much out of her.  Okay.  All right, let's...  So you want me to just hold the phone there?  Hold the phone, and we will be absolutely quiet, girl, right now.  All right, ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, let's go. 
[02:20:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you for you.  That was the best one, yeah.  It's not too sweet, it's not too tart, it's six o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Throw out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish, it's six o'clock,  it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor, dance up and let yourself roar, queef. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  So that was good?  What a sound.  That was fantastic.  She said she could keep going.  Well, I don't know, maybe tomorrow.  All right.  Did you ever bring her to a party?  Oh, my.  Don't say that.  Hey.  Hold on, hold on.  Norton with his foul language.  Yeah.  Dump guy might have been asleep at the wheel, be careful with words like that.  No, no, he is not.  Hey, why don't we have her do that as we go to commercial, because we're getting ready  for the wiffle ball bat challenge. 
[02:21:30]  Yes.  Hold on, I keep, oh, are you saying hold on, keep your clothes on?  Are you insane, Opie?  I stopped myself.  You're some kind of a homosexual?  I stopped myself.  I got a half a roll.  She's got to prepare.  All right, she's preparing over there.  Why doesn't your friend do a little more of that, and we're going to take a break.  All right.  And we'll see where we're at when we get back, okay?  All right, thanks, guys.  Give her the, do it, you know, yeah.  All right, here, here you go. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking.  They do all the talking for us.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, this is where we're at.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Daniella in the studio.  With her Chinese friend that doesn't get to bang her. 
[02:22:30]  She's wearing black panties.  And a, who gave her the wow shirt?  Who's the idiot that gave her a shirt?  John.  What are you, stupid?  You're not supposed to give the girls shirts.  There you go.  All right, well, the wow shirt is now off.  And she's got black, brown panties on.  Nice, yeah, sure.  20 years old.  Hot.  Bugs me.  You're digging that, right, Norton? 
[02:23:00]  Solid.  Obviously.  He's showing everyone what he's sporting.  Solid.  Yeah, he keeps pointing at his crotch going, look, nice, right?  Nice.  Like we're all so proud of Norton's junk.  Well, this is for the SmackDown tickets.  Yeah.  Well, are we ready to go?  Sticky.  Yeah, we got to get a mic position.  All right, well, everybody get into mic position.  All right.  Where's Mike?  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Where's Mike?  Hubbler, hubbler, hubbler. 
[02:23:30]  All right, this is on.  Now, Mary, are you going to be doing the honors?  Wow.  What a treat that is.  What happened to Stinky?  He chickened out.  Why did Stinky chicken out?  Stinky, why did you chicken out?  Every time, Rick always tries to pass off for me doing it.  Like, I'm here, and he's like, maybe someone else wants to do it, so.  No, I didn't say that.  You constantly do it.  I think she wants a girl to help her.  You can, you can.  This is.  She wants a girl to do it. 
[02:24:00]  Wait a minute.  Why didn't chicken out?  Hold on.  Stinky.  She wants a girl to do it.  This is Stinky's gig, though.  Do you want to do it?  Stinky does the whiffle ball bat challenge.  You always.  It's not with a girl doing it to a girl, you know.  I don't want to ruin the fantasy.  You got, like, Fred Flintstone mouth down there.  What do you mean?  Razor stubble?  Look at that.  Who cares about that?  A little 615 razor stubble.  Mary, you know what you're doing?  Well, it's been a while, but, uh.  Been a while since you put a whiffle ball bat?  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  What the hell are you doing off of this show?  So, you really want, I think a guy would know.  Okay, fine.  Let's see your technique.  Mary, let's see your technique.  Unsnap the back of that.  She's going right with this, but not okay with the bra.  Whatever.  Uh-oh, that means there's a flaw in the boobs.  What's wrong with her boobs, bro?  What's the matter?  Nice.  You have what?  She's got big.  Wait, let me see.  Everyone.  Whoa, hey, look at that.  Yeah, look at that.  A little power faucet. 
[02:25:00]  What's wrong with that?  She's nothing.  Look at Norton is like now.  Oh, God, Norton.  Holy Jesus.  Nice.  Jesus.  They are really soft.  Going up faster than that building across the street.  Exactly.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's, uh, let's get this.  All right.  Uh, Mary, if you would, um, go with the honors.  Remember, you're the first of the year, so anything and you're in the lead.  Just remember that.  The other hole, man. 
[02:25:30]  No, wait a minute.  We can't say that word.  Wow.  All right, well.  How's it working?  Well, uh, things are going on.  How's it going?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Tell me when to stop.  There we go.  You gotta go up.  Up?  No, no.  That means your side has to go down.  God, that's what I'm saying.  She doesn't know where to go, Mary.  Mary doesn't know where to go.  Just make sure you go. 
[02:26:00]  Can you cry and say, I'm sorry, Dad?  Stop it.  Just.  Is it good, bad, or indifferent?  It's bad.  People aren't as savvy.  It's okay.  That's why he needs to do this.  He knows what he's doing.  He knows what he can say.  Where was it?  Get the expert.  No, you can't say that.  It was there. 
[02:26:30]  Get stinky in here.  Get the expert in here before having an aneurysm.  Stinky, take the bat.  Holy S.  Thank you.  Take the gloves off her.  Jeez.  I hope he's so upset.  Because I said she can't say what she said, and she said it again.  Is this a mic by me?  Plus, she almost choked her.  And that's all. 
[02:27:00]  All right, you ready for round two?  No one's ever done two rounds.  Don't worry.  Stinky knows what he's doing.  My mouth is dry.  Stinky knows what he's doing.  Give her some water.  This is Stinky's gig.  I have all the confidence in the world.  Stinky knows what he's doing, and he'll do it right.  Wow.  No offense to Mary.  Too late.  She's offense-ed.  She's all right.  She does not like you right now.  I saw her face off.  She's effing pissed at you.  All right.  Whatever, man. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Okay.  Just relax.  It's the whole name of this game.  Look how gentle Stinky is.  Look at that.  Nice.  Oh, stop it.  It looks like...  Oh, shut up.  I didn't even push it.  I don't even say shut up.  It's okay.  Listen.  Listen.  Everyone shut the F up.  Just can't mention anything about anything.  Okay.  So, all right.  You could start the whole thing rolling, and then Stinky will continue until you say enough. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Take three.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Here we go.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  There's a slow turning, sort of like the Roto-Rooter Man action Stinky's got going there.  All right.  Stinks in shock right now.  What do you think?  Okay.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:28:30]  Do you want him to move it up, down, side, anything?  Anything?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Wait a minute.  Are you in pain?  Just say.  Oh, that's kind of good, right?  You have to say when.  Oh.  Wow.  Is she...  You liking this?  What's the lump in her stomach?  You liking this a little?  All right.  Wait.  Hello.  Say when when you're...  When...  Oh, okay.  Mark!  Mark it!  All right.  Mark it, Stinky Mark it.  Let's Stinky Mark it.  Oh, oh.  I know.  Take the pain. 
[02:29:00]  Take the pain.  That's it?  That was it.  Wow.  That's it?  What?  Could be the most shallow mark we've ever had.  I want to marry her.  Yeah, that's kind of a good thing.  Oh, man.  That's it.  Wait a minute.  Mary had...  Wait a minute.  I was bad at it now.  Wait a minute.  Where's your mark, Mary?  It was a little further.  It was further.  That doesn't mean it's better, Mary.  Wow.  Hey, if you could only take that much, he'd be perfect for you. 
[02:29:30]  And it's yellow.  Oh, God.  Wow.  All right.  Well, you know something?  Bravo.  Nice.  You're the first of the year.  And that was great.  Great to watch.  Mark that.  You doing all right there, Daniela?  Wow.  Yeah, you all right?  You're going to be able to walk and everything? 
[02:30:00]  I feel great.  Yeah?  That was the coolest thing that ever happened to me.  Now, I noticed you were kind of...  Well, you're really good.  Was it good?  I was enjoying it.  Oh, you are enjoying it.  I like pain every once in a while.  Yeah?  Hey, Norton, smack her.  I have fallen in love with a guest.  She's great.  I think he's just joking.  No, you're terrific.  No, he's serious.  Believe me.  Believe me.  I think you're...  Give me a napkin.  Oh, here you are.  Norton helping out.  Norton.  Pull your shirt up. 
[02:30:30]  I got, like, four going right now.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Oh, boy.  All right, why don't we give...  Anyone call in for that?  Huh?  Anyone call in for that?  Call in what?  What's there to say?  Wow.  Why don't we give her the SmackDown tickets?  Where are you?  SmackDown tickets.  There you go.  There are good seats, too.  Who are you guys...  You're going to...  Okay.  I don't know.  There's four of them?  Yeah.  Have fun.  Come, let me know.  Have fun.  There you go.  Are you going?  We're going.  Yeah?  But Norton will be sitting in that seat with her. 
[02:31:00]  You're what?  No, I can't.  I've got to leave tomorrow morning.  Thank you.  I make you worth your while.  Oh, God damn.  Not another one.  Helmet pinching.  I'm doing helmet pinching.  Hey, Jim, see if you can trick her into getting pregnant and then get an abortion.  That's a great game.  Well, let's hear it for Danielle and the Chinese guy.  Yeah.  Nice.  She was great.  Bravo.  Any final thoughts?  Chinese guy?  Once we do this again? 
[02:31:30]  Well, we'll keep tabs on you for when we do the lesbian thing, Rick.  How can I get in touch with you guys?  That way.  I'll let you know before you go.  Well, we do a radio show.  We're on it every day.  Available at 212-757-1027.  That's right.  Just like everyone else.  All right?  Hey, let's hear for our guests again.  There you go.  There they go.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's hear it for our guests. 
[02:32:00]  She's in a thong.  Yeah.  She's got to put her pants on.  Take your time.  No.  You can walk her out.  How's that?  Let's hear it for our guests.  No rush.  Thank you very much.  There you go.  Terrific.  Zip.  There it is.  What's up?  Her shoes now?  I got a drop of clear stuff the size of a weather balloon.  Oh, my goodness.  And there we go.  All right.  Let's hear for our guests. 
[02:32:30]  She got her belt, too.  Wow.  Way.  There's the belt.  We definitely have different tastes.  Gavin, what's up?  Hey.  Well, we don't need to talk about it in that terms.  Is it a third of the last one?  Let's just put it this way.  It's a very beatable mark.  All right.  Well, we look forward to the competition.  How does that say?  Sounds good.  We just started the competition for the new year.  Well done, Twillers.  Daniela and our guests. 
[02:33:00]  The Chinese guys.  There you go.  Nice.  There you go.  Very nice.  Oh.  I hope he's still clapping.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, Der.  There he goes.  And there goes Norton.  Where are you coming, Norton?  He's having fun.  Oh, my God.  There he goes.  He's talking to us.  Of course he is.  He's making time.  Uh, Gary.  Yo.  11-year-old Gary, what's up? 
[02:33:30]  Guess what?  What's up?  I called in yesterday.  He said, don't worry.  When Gary turns 12, your ratings will go up.  Yeah.  Today's my birthday.  Get out of here.  Today's your birthday, Gary.  Are you joking?  I was thinking when Opie said it's coming up soon, I'm like, is he stalking me?  That was freaky when you said, oh, um, your birthday's coming up soon.  Gary, are you 12-year-old Gary now?  Yep.  Oh, well, fix the phone line there.  I, I, whoever's typing on the phone, you got to put 12-year-old Gary. 
[02:34:00]  It's kind of like James at 15 now.  It's James at 16, but it's Gary now at 12.  So it's, uh, 12-year-old Gary.  Guys, I was talking, I was thinking about Drudge.  I want that competition still.  Ouch.  I forgot what that was.  Yeah, Drudge Jr. is out.  He's...  Oh, oh, yeah, I'm sorry.  He's, uh, losing.  So what are you doing for your 12th, uh, birthday there, Gary?  Norton.  Norton.  Just driving around Brooklyn.  Driving around Brooklyn.  Who's driving you around?  Uh, my dad.  Right on, man.  Where'd you go to get something to eat and stuff? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  What'd he say?  My dad.  What'd he say?  He said, where's those hockey tickets?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Are you hoping?  Oh, boy.  He's supposed to take the kids to an interview.  You never met my dad.  You never met my dad, did you?  No.  I haven't met you.  Oh, well, that's true.  Hey, you want to talk to my dad?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  All right.  How you doing, Gary?  Quite the little handful you got there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Today's his birthday.  He wanted to call in and let you guys know. 
[02:35:00]  What are you doing for Gary's birthday?  Oh, today's just having a cake.  And, uh, Sunday we're going to have a little get-together at our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Ah, Chinese restaurant for the birthday.  That's nice.  Yeah.  You get him a good gift?  Oh, sure.  Where do you get him?  PlayStation 2.  Ah.  Nice, Dad.  Very good.  Nice.  You get him, uh, Grand Theft Auto 3?  Uh, can't talk about that.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  That's a good one, by the way.  All right.  He wants to talk to you back.  He'll go on.  All right.  Who's Gary's dad on the phone there?  Hey, Gary.  Hey, Gary.  12-year-old Gary.  All right.  Well, have a great birthday, Eric.  Happy birthday, kid.  Thanks, guys.  And we'll be going to that game very soon.  All right.  Oh, I was outside the studio, Gary.  Happy birthday, pal.  It's Norton.  All right.  Fast forward.  Thanks, Jordan.  And, Norton, when you're talking about, uh, who is that?  Uh, uh, Jones, uh.  Joan Rivers.  Joan Rivers. 
[02:36:00]  You know, I thought you were my favorite guy, you know, my favorite comedian when you said that.  That broke my heart.  Well, you know.  Why are you breaking the kids?  I hate, I hate John Rivers.  I wish he was at the movie.  Go, oh, what did you learn?  Just have a heart attack and pat that on the red carpet with all blood.  I'm a flyer with the red carpet.  It will be, it will be a movie, like, 12 years from then.  I'll, I'll just laugh my ass off.  Yeah, he, he wants.  I hate Joan Rivers.  He wants Joan Rivers to die.  I hate the Golden Girls. 
[02:36:30]  I, I hate the Golden Girls.  I wish they got hit by a bus.  All right, there.  That's why you're my favorite young man.  Isn't he a fine, fine young man?  Now he's 12-year-old Gary, by the way.  Norton, I still love you.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, Gary.  All right.  All right, Gary.  Thanks, Gary.  Bye.  Have a good birthday.  Let's, uh, there you go.  Let's fast forward.  Hi, Opie, it's Gary.  I'm 35 years old.  Can I please go to the hockey game?  Jesus Christ.  It's my 35th birthday today.  The Islanders are finally in the Stanley Cup.  That's great. 
[02:37:00]  Get in your flying car and take me to the Islander game.  Right.  I'll wear my best Mylar future suit.  Hey, you got to read that divorce story really fast.  Yeah, this is another thing.  Well, earlier we were talking about Michael Jordan.  Got his divorce.  He's getting divorced.  I was just reading up on thesmokinggun.com, the, uh, divorce, uh, the initial paperwork  that was, uh, served to Michael Jordan.  She's like, yeah, I need half everything.  Half everything.  But then there was a little, another little section in it that said, um, she owns some 
[02:37:30]  stuff that isn't marital property and she will retain that stuff.  That isn't going to be divvied up.  Do you think anything Michael Jordan says isn't marital property, uh, he's going to be able  to keep?  No.  I don't think so.  No.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  How's this?  For a set of brass goddamn balls on a guy.  This, you got to respect this guy.  A man jailed for nearly seven years for contempt of court. 
[02:38:00]  When you're jailed for contempt of court, here's how you get out.  You give the court what they want and you walk.  That's how you get out.  You're jailed for contempt.  You stay in there until you give the court what they want.  Then you're free.  It's up to you.  It's up to you.  Seven years this guy stayed in jail because he wouldn't turn over 2.5 million bucks in  his divorce case.  That is an FU.  He was imprisoned for, uh, it's the longest, uh, stretch on, on civil contempt. 
[02:38:30]  They asked him, where is 2.5 million?  He said, I don't know.  I lost it somewhere.  They knew he had it in some offshore accounts.  He just didn't fess up to it.  They put him in jail.  Uh, they just recently, uh, figured out that this was, um, this was then amounting after  seven years to punishment, not to coerce him to, to give up the, uh, the information  on the money.  So it can't be punishment without a trial.  So they set him free.  Seven years.  They say if they left the money, uh, that if he left the money in an account, he'd probably 
[02:39:00]  have about six mil now.  So just short of a mil a year, who wouldn't take that deal maybe?  And what an FU to the ex-twat.  What an FU.  You know something?  I'd rather sit and rot in jail for seven years than fork over this money to you.  Now the guy's out.  But how are we going to do a radio show?  Well, maybe ISDN lines.  Oh, oh, you're talking about this guy.  Oh, I'm talking about this Philly guy.  This guy from Philly.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  So you know something?  God bless you. 
[02:39:30]  There it is.  A brass set of balls on this guy.  Stuck to his guns on that one.  All right.  I'm distracted because look at Andrew.  Andrew, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I just wanted to say that today on the Opie and Anthony show, I learned that according  to Dr. Opie, the stomach now has joints.  Well, Dr. Smith kind of said that his mom died of arthritis and a bleeding stomach.  So I thought that stomachs had joints or something. 
[02:40:00]  And Anthony, just a question.  Why would a future suit in the future still be called a future suit?  Oh, one of those witty little things.  Wouldn't it be a present suit?  It's a present suit, you dick.  You're right.  Why do you drive on a parkway and park in a driveway?  7-Eleven's open 24 hours a day.  Why are there locks on the doors?  Why do they have interstate highways in Hawaii?  Who's going to another state?  Why do they call TV sets? 
[02:40:30]  There's only one.  Why do they call the apartments?  They're all together.  I've never actually heard any of these.  It's an old radio gag.  They spend the whole morning doing that and they all laugh.  They laugh.  Oh, you mean so much?  They laugh and laugh and laugh.  There's millions of them.  There's millions of them.  How could you not?  Huddle, huddle, chuckle, chuckle.  Like, why is Andrea Yates called a mother when she has no kids?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Holy ass. 
[02:41:00]  Thank you, Andrew.  You're welcome.  Wow.  Why do you always top me?  Why do you feel like you have to top me?  Oh, that is so bad.  I actually just...  Wonderful.  I had people laughing for once and you top me.  What's with Jeff here on Line 9?  I'm pretty amazed at this myself.  Jeff Lex.  Jeff, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Jefferson Township, New Jersey.  Okay.  And you just started listening to us?  Yeah, just like three, four weeks ago.  Because, you know, I really never listened to the radio. 
[02:41:30]  There you go.  How did you find out about us?  We've been on the radio three and a half years in New York.  Well, I've learned about you guys.  But, you know, I just really never listened to the radio because of my job.  So, finally...  Go ahead.  I just recently started working for an electrician and, you know, he just listened to it every  day and I was like, oh, my God, this show is amazing.  I just can't believe it.  It's the best damn radio show I've ever heard.  Jeff, you don't even know what you missed the last three and a half years.  I don't know.  I heard about the Voyeur bus.  Uh-huh.  Wish I heard that. 
[02:42:00]  Uh-huh.  The homeless shopping spree number one.  I heard that was terrific.  Uh-huh.  I was in tune for a homeless shopping spree number two.  There you go.  I could not stop laughing when that guy started taking his pants off.  It was funny.  In the show.  All right.  I also actually, I liked it so much, I listened to it Christmas Eve again.  Oh, cool.  Thank you, Jeff.  Yeah.  You don't stop from Jersey.  You don't hang out with Dr. Smith, do you?  Oh, dear.  You want to get a life.  Thank you, Jeff.  Oh, you're welcome.  You guys take care.  Bye.  Bye.  You know, you're a new listener, Opie.  You want to treat him with kid gloves. 
[02:42:30]  Of course.  What do we learn next?  Welcome to the bottomless kids of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That thing's hilarious.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What a fun-filled show we have today.  We forgot to mention that Dave Thomas from Wendy's died.  Who cares? 
[02:43:00]  Must have been his diet.  Oh, thanks for stopping by.  Liver cancer, I believe.  That's a toughie.  Oh, you don't want the liver cancer.  That's a bad one.  I think the liver and pancreas one, I like the...  Yeah, you can't...  That's the bad one.  You can't really live without a liver.  That's the Bill Bixby cancer.  The, uh...  Who else had that one?  Pa from, uh...  Oh, uh...  Little House on the Prayer.  Michael Landon.  That's the one where you start taking the coffee enemas. 
[02:43:30]  I think my dad's first wife had the liver cancer.  Oh, that's a bad one.  Yeah.  That's the only reason why I'm here.  His first wife died.  Wow.  Does that haunt you a little bit, uh...  A little bit, a little bit.  Trying to sleep at night, thinking if things had just gone a little different, you wouldn't  even be, uh...  High school sweetheart, you know?  Not married too long.  Mm-hmm.  She dies of, I think, liver cancer.  He doesn't talk about it.  I think liver cancer.  28 years old.  That's the only reason I'm here.  You'd still be here.  I wouldn't be here.  I wouldn't be here. 
[02:44:00]  I don't believe that crap.  What, I'd be here, but in a different form?  Well, that could be.  Uh, Britney Spears in the paper today.  Her butt looks fat, and, uh, her legs are looking, uh, kind of tree-trunky.  I got a laugh track over here.  You know I would have hit it.  I think my dad alone, he's had a tough life.  I'm not talking about that.  I don't...  It's nothing personal.  Strictly comedy business.  Oh, yeah.  I'd have hit that goddamn button.  I was looking.  Actually, I was trying to find myself.  No, I'm just kidding.  My dad listens to this. 
[02:44:30]  Relax.  All right.  Chill out, everyone.  Come on.  Uh, what else?  Oh, uh...  My dad listens to...  Oh, right there.  That's right.  He's dead.  Forgot about that.  What do you mean?  You're dead?  Yeah, my dad's dead.  What did he die of?  It was a heart attack.  He would have listened, too.  Yeah.  He would have been, uh...  He would have enjoyed the show.  I think he would have liked the show.  He'd...  He'd...  He'd have been so proud of his little boy. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  Oh.  Hey, really fast.  We forgot to mention this, too.  Remember, uh, Big Brother 2?  No.  Remember the...  I know.  Remember the guy with the knife, Justin?  Oh, yeah.  The guy that, uh...  He got kicked off the show because he held a knife to, uh...  To the girl's throat in the kitchen.  Right.  But he was saying he was just fooling around and stuff.  And they kicked him out like, no way.  But they kicked him out because they don't want that kind of image.  Even though it's reality TV, they don't want that type of reality.  No, not real reality.  Right.  So, uh...  I can't even confirm if this is true, but there's a story coming out of Bayonne, New Jersey. 
[02:45:30]  The former Big Brother contestant who was kicked off the show for holding a knife to a woman's throat is facing charges.  He assaulted his girlfriend.  Justin of Bayonne was arrested Monday after the woman was found on a Bayonne street around 2 a.m.  with a broken ankle and choke marks around her neck, police said.  Nice.  Uh, Justin choked her and threw her on the ground, causing her to fracture her ankle, according to a police report.  I was nowhere near the scene.  He was arrested at the scene and later released on a $1,000 bail.  A thousand bucks bail.  I can't confirm this, but it looks, uh, legit. 
[02:46:00]  Uh, probably $10,000.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Rick points and goes, look, it's off the AP.  Maybe the guy wrote AP when he sent in the fake story, Rick.  Don't write AP.  You want to make it legitimate.  That's it.  Okay.  Holy, am I out of...  Can I say something, then?  I learned as long as it says AP, it's got to be legit.  You know the gerbil story with the gay guy and...  AP.  It said AP in Los Angeles Times.  It was a fake story. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, my God.  I can't believe he said that.  In hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  Rick points at the story and says, look, it has to be real.  It says AP.  AP.  It's a...  It's a...  It's an email.  That's because he's AP-ler.  But in this case, it's...  AP-ler.  We're finding it all over the internet, but it's still funny that Rick said AP.  The internet, just...  The woman was treating it as a...  ...the hospital reached at his home.  Well, Justin predicted the charge would be dismissed and said the arrest resulted from a misunderstanding. 
[02:47:00]  No.  So that's going on as well today.  Good boy, Justin.  You guys want to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today?  No?  Okay.  Quickly, also, more from the we are doomed as a society and we are going to get another terrorist attack  and someone will kill many more people in this country.  In Maryland, a civil rights organization demanding Northwest Airlines apologize for allegedly forcing  a Muslim high school student to remove her headscarf at an airport security checkpoint.  They wanted to look under your goddamn hat and... 
[02:47:30]  It's a scarf, yeah.  Whatever the frig they call it.  You know something, going through the airport security, I saw a bunch of people, regular  white folk, whatever.  Go ahead.  And they had to take off the baseball cap and look underneath.  Oh, this is rock.  I'm sorry.  Paul from Center Reach.  Paul from Center Reach.  This just did it.  And it says AP, so it's got to be right.  Rick's a fag that tastes his own stuff.  And then AP.  It's right off the AP.  It says AP right there.  It's got to be real. 
[02:48:00]  That's right.  It is funny.  If you don't think that's funny, then...  That's funny.  Paul from Center Reach.  Very good.  Rick's a fag that tastes his own stuff.  AP.  I would question that in some feedback usually, but it says AP in parentheses.  That's fake.  That's not news.  Oh, God.  All right.  Let's go to what did we learn today.  Todd, what's going on?  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey.  Oh, man.  I just wanted to know, how can we drive on a parkway, park on a driveway, cargo goes 
[02:48:30]  by ship, shipment goes by truck, but how come a woman's got a pair of panties but just  one bra?  Oh, ho!  Pair of panties but just one bra.  Interesting.  Oh, this just in off the AP from Buffalo.  It's got to be real.  It says AP right there.  Yeah, I see.  Rick is a douche.  AP.  Oh, my God.  Now, usually I would stick up for my pal, Rick, but it says AP in parentheses.  AP.  You are getting so real, Rick. 
[02:49:00]  But it says AP.  It says AP.  I'm sorry.  You got me.  You got me.  If it's in the AP and I'll be read it, it's got to be true then.  It says AP.  Because I'm not a newsman, you know.  It says AP.  Are you sure?  It says AP.  AP.  Because you read this divorce story and you took it as true.  It says AP.  Jackass.  Ron, what's up?  How are you doing, old man?  All right, Ron. 
[02:49:30]  I learned Dr. Smith's only crack-up number is 1-888-248.  And the laugh killed me.  There you go.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, dear.  We like the Dr. Smith.  Kevin, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Today I learned it doesn't matter if you're Michael Jordan or just a little pin knocker  from Long Island.  It's the bitches that are getches.  It's the bitches that are getches.  You got that right.  Thank you, Kevin.  No problem.  Bye.  Hold on.  And if there's more breaking news off the AP, Anthony, you guys are answers. 
[02:50:00]  This is off the AP.  Paul reporting Rick is a blank slurping.  Is a, yeah.  Yeah.  He's a blank slurper.  He's a blank slurper.  And it says reports confirmed from Buffalo, New York.  AP.  Another AP story coming in.  Norton is one sick F, so.  Oh, look at this one.  He's even got a date.  Makes it even more legit.  January 8, 2002.  AP live wire.  Rick likes to look at man junk. 
[02:50:30]  And it says AP.  This just in off the New York AP, Anthony.  Very different from the Buffalo AP.  Norton kicks WWF star Bubba Ray Dudley's ass.  More to follow.  Mike, what's going on?  This on the AP?  Norton's a kid toucher.  Look, I read it.  Well, obviously.  The AP doesn't lie.  You don't need the AP for that.  No.  Mike, what's going on?  That's also on my website.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  I'm just going to tell you.  I learned that Japanese guys are the roundest of ball. 
[02:51:00]  Yes, of course they are.  Yeah, I never knew that.  I was always wondering how I could difference.  I don't think that's true.  It is.  Japanese women have more.  Their eyes are more round.  Definitely.  Than the Chinese.  You know what, though?  Without a doubt.  Mrs. Livingston from the courtship of Eddie's father was Chinese, right?  She had more eyes.  Fake Chinese.  Than I think I remember.  Right.  What about the old movies where they didn't have, like, Asian actors, so they made the white  women look like Asians? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, just throw a little eye makeup on you and make you talk stupid.  Another AP report coming in.  Yeah.  It says, Mad Max loves the Ark.  Now, I would defend my pal Rick, but it says AP in parentheses.  What can I do?  Mad Max loves the Ark.  I love it.  All right.  Pat, what's going on?  Yo, I learned that too many pills will kill me.  And I also learned that Rick works for the AP, the Ass Pirates. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that Stinky Stinks.  Yep.  ONA is a show where everyone knows your name.  Yep.  Anthony looks good.  And according to me, it's 9-11, not 7-11.  Very good.  Nice talking to you.  Good job, Jimmy.  Dan, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that it takes a fat cutter to realize Opie's a nice one. 
[02:52:30]  Very good.  Maybe I'll run into you guys tomorrow at the tavern.  Bye.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, this is off the AP in Washington, D.C.  Opie and Anthony, number one in ratings in D.C.  Oh, wow.  It says AP.  It says AP.  It's got to be true.  How could you point to that and say, look, it says AP?  Because every goddamn story we print out usually has AP written on it.  January 8, 2002, off the AP, Anthony.  Mad Max, but the sex in the city yam bag was too quick. 
[02:53:00]  And it was a quote.  Oh, a quote.  And it's a developing story.  It says developing.  It says AP, though.  I know.  Well, this is off the AP in New York.  Rick is a fudge-packing, blank-guzzling douche-blank who tickles blanks in his spare time.  AP.  AP.  Okay.  If it said rooters, I'd question it.  Just checking.  Just checking.  Well, a rooter's joke. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  Martin, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Happy to hear from Philly.  Yo, how's the ratings from here, man?  I think we find out tomorrow.  I thought it was today, but it wasn't.  So, false alarm.  We'll have a report.  Yeah.  Right at three, good, bad, or indifferent, we'll tell you the truth.  And the Marilyn Monroe clip from the break was, I've never laughed, like, harder than that.  That was awesome.  Marilyn Monroe gas.  I learned that, uh...  Oh, over break.  Okay.  Yeah, over the break.  We don't listen to that crap when we're not here.  No, I'm just kidding.  What's up, man?  I learned that birds can land on Triple H's chest and drink off it. 
[02:54:00]  And Dr. Smith was even more boring before he took Golden Mood.  There you go.  At least you got it out.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  I like you, Martin.  You're all right.  Oh, thanks, man.  You got it, too.  All right.  Breaking news coming out of Texas over the AP.  Oh, yeah?  Hoping Anthony moved to Afternoon Drive in Dallas.  Oh, good.  Uh, and this off the AP, uh, Bin Laden's dead.  Killed by incestant nagging from retired Laverne Shirley. 
[02:54:30]  Anyway, breaking news here on the OpenAzor Show.  It's got to be true.  It says AP right there.  Yeah, but it's not even funny.  AP Entertainment News.  Rick starring in the new episode of Queer as Folk.  So look for that on Showtime.  Tony, what's going on?  I learned Mary did it right the first time.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Rick, you fag.  Goddamn, that's funny, man.  Tony, quick while you're at it, because you did really well. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hello?  Hey.  Hold on.  Breaking news on the AP.  Yeah.  This just in from the AP, in parentheses, Dr. Smith found dead in his bathtub, golden  mood, overdose, suspected.  Oh, we've got to look out for that.  What's up, Paul?  What did you learn today?  I learned that there are actually people stupid enough out there to mess with a guy  like Bubba Ray Dudley.  Yeah.  That was funny.  I think the clip will be up on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  I really wanted to talk to him, but he left.  Yeah.  I'm a really big fan of WWS. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, he's a great guy.  He's a good friend of the show, too.  Oh, my God.  Breaking news here.  Off the AP, I believe.  Yes, the AP.  Today, Chinese man gets no sex from abortion prankster chick that would rather bang a plastic  bat than a China man.  AP, we all know it's true.  It's just got to say AP.  Shut up! 
[02:56:00]  All right, Rick.  Now I'm with you, man.  This is all the AP.  Stalker, Patty, and Opie married.  I mean, come on.  You cruel bastards.  AP, Rick is a sea dumpster.  It just takes one slip up on this show for 40 minutes of radio.  Hey, off the AP, Anthony.  Opie takes 12-year-old Gary to an honors game.  That can't be true.  We might have to play the AP game every day. 
[02:56:30]  It's part of the new format for the new year.  Now it's just spilling in.  AP from New York, poor ratings, gets O&A secret suspension.  AP, right out of New York here.  Opie and Al Dukes go out for a beer.  All right, I think the AP gag is getting old.  Why is that if it stopped us?  It's off the AP.  Opie and Anthony don't know when to quit.  All right, we're out-y. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, we can leave with the poo-poo platter song about our show.  This can't be true off the AP.  Boston Mayor Tom Manino?  Nah.  No, no, no.  Of course.  We'll leave you with this.  We'll leave you.  The local Buffalo paper told us, well, wrote that we were the most offensive radio show  in local radio history, something like that.  Okay, we'll leave with this.  See you tomorrow, three.  Peace. 
[02:57:30]  The most offensive show in local radio history.  Niggers, spick, kike, chick, muddog, picketing.  Naked teen girls with their pants down to their knees.  Take a squat on Norton's face.  Make fun of HIV.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Forever may your movies hang high.  Make fun of those unfortunate like retard, snake, or heat.  Uh-oh.  The most offensive show in local radio history. </pre>
