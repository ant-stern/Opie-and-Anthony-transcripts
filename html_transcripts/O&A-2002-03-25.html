<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the usual chaotic banter between Opie and Anthony, including a nonsensical song and discussion of their recent vacation and unexpectedly high Philadelphia ratings (despite no longer using a ratings service).  A large volume of calls poured in, one congratulating Anthony on unspecified allegations detailed in two newspapers—allegations Anthony claimed predated the articles.

The show's main focus swiftly shifted to Anthony's finalized divorce, fueled by recent news articles.  The hosts joked about Anthony's reported $100 million net worth juxtaposed with his seemingly modest lifestyle. Numerous callers phoned in, largely to congratulate Anthony and offer humorous comments about his newfound wealth and freedom; one even recounted seeing Anthony leaving the courthouse.

Following this, the discussion turned to the Oscars, specifically Halle Berry's Best Actress win and her acceptance speech (which was played in full).  A lengthy, racially charged conversation ensued between Opie, Anthony, and Earl, a Black member of the staff, focusing on Berry’s race, her speech, and other aspects of the ceremony, including the use of numerous racial slurs and stereotypes.

The show returned to Anthony's divorce, starting with a humorous anecdote about him possibly kissing his brother on a Kiss Cam at a hockey game.  The hosts, interrupted by numerous calls, detailed the two-and-a-half-year-long divorce proceedings.  Several callers expressed frustration at the show's delay in covering this.  Comedian Colin Quinn called in to promote his show and joke about Anthony's divorce, followed by frequent guest Jim Norton, whose comedic contributions included jokes about Pamela Anderson and Hepatitis C.  Unexpectedly, Anthony's lawyer, Dominic Barbara, also called, engaging in a humorous exchange with the hosts.

Anthony read excerpts from several newspaper articles detailing his divorce, including a "frisky menage a trois,"  and summarized his settlement while highlighting confidentiality restrictions. This segment was punctuated by vulgar jokes, sexual references, and numerous caller interruptions, ranging from amusement to anger regarding the show's delayed coverage of the divorce.

Further discussion of Anthony's divorce followed, focusing on humorous and crude details from court proceedings as reported in various news articles, detailing alleged affairs and group sex.  Dominic Barbara was frequently mentioned, often derisively.  Opie read from what appeared to be a modified, arguably fabricated, version of the articles, adding inflammatory comments.  Listener calls included comedic commentary and angry "F.U." messages.  The show briefly touched upon a lawsuit against Celine Dion's husband involving alleged sexual assault and included a "What Did We Learn?" segment summarizing the show's highlights.  The broadcast concluded with brief mention of upcoming television appearances and teasers of future show topics, including Nixon and a homophobic slur.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Two girls for every boy.  That is, that is very funny.  What?  Why would that song be making some kind of a comeback?  What?  On this program.  What?  Take your bra off and take it off now.  Don't shoot the head.  Don't shoot the head. 
[00:00:30]  Don't shoot the head.  Don't shoot the head. 
[00:01:00]  Don't shoot the head.  All right.  Where did that song come from?  What the hell is that?  Hey, we had a big team today.  I bet.  Bunch of smart asses.  Bunch of goddamn smart asses.  Ah, that's good.  Hey, how was your vacation?  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How was your vacation?  What?  Two hours for every boy. 
[00:01:30]  Should I sheepishly deny it or a couple sheepishly?  A couple phone numbers.  Yeah, we're back from vacation and it seems like a lot of things happened while we were away.  What a great vacation.  Wasn't it good?  Yeah.  Shut up.  What a tour.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Well, we really don't even have to give out the phone numbers today for some reason, Anthony.  Why is that?  They just seem to be lighting up.  I think they've been waiting a week to talk to us.  Yes.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philly.  Philly.  Philly.  I got to tell you.  I'm here and we're doing really, really well in Philly.  I'm hearing things.  We're hearing things about ratings and things.  A little bit.  No, you made fun.  You made fun.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little more than a little bit. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm hearing through the grapevine.  Goddamn Philly.  Now, we don't know for sure because our company doesn't subscribe to the ratings anymore.  No.  For some reason, I guess they're hashing that problem out.  But I guess Tim Sabian put his ear to the ground and he's hearing things.  Yeah.  He's hearing things about the ratings in Philly for the O&A show.  You know, the...  So if you're in Philly or anywhere else outside of New York, give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  Wow, look at all the people that want to talk about the Oscars on the phone.  That must be it. 
[00:03:00]  The Oscars.  Yeah, the Oscars, Anthony.  Oh, they switched our phones around since we've been...  Ah.  That's okay.  We'll go over here.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What an appropriate song to start the show off with.  I don't understand what you're even talking about.  You're worth a hundred million dollars?  Yeah.  Wow.  So I've been told.  You guys made it a lot. 
[00:03:30]  You guys suck.  See you later.  So I've been told.  The lies.  Oh, my God.  We'll get to the whole damn thing.  Did you realize that you were worth a hundred million dollars, Anthony?  Opie, I still don't.  You're still wearing the same crappy sweater when I found you seven years ago.  I got the same sweater off.  I have my Swatch watch.  I think even Opie wears a tag, and just because somebody gave it to him.  Oh, that's because Joey Paisano gave his tag.  I still have my Swatch. 
[00:04:00]  Look at my sneakers.  Dude.  I've had these for about two years.  Look at the bottom of your sneakers.  I know.  All you see is white, because the tread is worn away.  A hundred million dollars.  A hundred million dollars.  You can buy shirts every day.  A million dollars.  And you know something?  That only means that you, too, are worth a hundred million dollars.  You are listening to two hundred million dollars worth of entertainment.  What a bunch of crap.  Two hundred.  A bargain at any price. 
[00:04:30]  A hundred million dollars.  A hundred million.  Why the hell am I still renting the top floor of a house?  Right.  What is wrong with me?  Yeah.  Why am I renting an apartment in Brooklyn?  I'm renting an apartment in Brooklyn.  I think I got to go shop for a mansion or something.  A compound.  How about just a house in general?  You know what I saw?  I saw something in the paper.  Dude, I rent the top half of a house, and I still can't get a hot shower, and I'm worth  a hundred million.  A hundred million. 
[00:05:00]  What am I doing?  I got pigeons that roost outside of my porch that I can't go out there.  There's wild animals out on the little patio.  But a hundred million.  I saw in the paper somebody was selling their house.  And it was a house in Hollywood Hills, and it was a 1.4 mil.  Something like that.  Beautiful thing.  And I'm like, how many of these can I buy?  You know, I could buy a whole neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills.  And let me tell you something.  I was reading the articles over break when I was up in Killington skiing. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And I'm saying, wow, I'm worth a hundred mil.  A hundred mil.  First thought in my head, I could buy pretty much any PlayStation 2 game I want.  Pretty much.  Maybe even two.  A hundred mil, sea sucker.  P, what's up?  Rob, listen, Anthony.  Yeah.  You are my hero.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  I've been trying to get my wife to do what you got your wife to do.  I've been trying for ten years now. 
[00:06:00]  Well.  Ten years done that.  If you have a hundred million to spend, it's your language.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I love you.  You've got to watch the language.  I'm sorry.  Listen, I'm sorry.  But man, you're my hero.  I just had to call and tell you that, man.  I don't know how you did it, but I wish I could do it.  All right, Pete.  I will say, of course.  You know what's funny about this?  No one outside New York has a clue what we're talking about yet.  No.  Well, we'll get to it in a few minutes here. 
[00:06:30]  It was in the...  But just to address something quickly, that gentleman was talking about, Opie.  Yeah.  Um, these allegations of certain things that happened were, um, actually, yes, when I was  a tin knocker, so it doesn't, it doesn't matter.  What?  It was when I was a tin knocker.  What happened?  These allegations, some of which ended up in two newspapers.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about. 
[00:07:00]  No, I...  I'm just saying that they were, you know, things were going on before.  So this wasn't the first time things went on?  Shut up.  You know that.  You bet.  Well, I got to play reporter here.  I'm not talking to anyone else, but you'll talk to your pal.  Well.  Well, let's go before.  I'm not going to get into any details.  Aaron, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Welcome back.  All right.  Remember when you were in school and you'd play, you know, What'd I Do on My Summer Vacation?  Yeah.  Well, I'm just wondering, maybe we can play a little game with what Anthony did on his, 
[00:07:30]  uh, little week off vacation.  Well, um, I was in court.  Really?  Really, you smartass.  Yes.  Know how, know how surreal it was?  I was up in, uh, Killington, uh, you know, doing some skiing and stuff, and in the morning  I'd go down the access road there to get, get my papers, and, uh, I'm reading the papers,  drinking some coffee.  There's a blizzard going on in, uh, Vermont, so I feel like I'm in another country.  And also, I'm going to the Daily News, uh, Daily News, excuse me, and the Post, and I 
[00:08:00]  see Anthony's picture, and I'm like, wait a minute, I, I know that guy.  I know that guy.  Yeah, but I wasn't thinking, you know what I mean?  And also, I'm like, oh my God!  Hey, and I got one more little observation.  You know that, uh, mock, the moffy guy, the chin, he walks around a little early in his  bathrobe and makes people think he's crazy?  Maybe that's what Anthony's doing with all the old clothes, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, doesn't want anyone, let anyone, let anyone in on the $100 million.  He still dresses better.  All right, Aaron.  Later, guys.  A couple more phone calls, and then we'll, uh, we'll read, you know what, I think we should 
[00:08:30]  read the articles.  Yeah.  I think they came out a week ago, uh, tomorrow.  It was, uh, Leo's last Tuesday.  Last Tuesday.  Oh.  And these are articles.  I will read them word for word.  Oh, you will?  You have your little bell over there, and when you want to comment, you just bing, bing,  bing.  And you can pipe in, okay?  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I think that's the way to do this, right?  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  And if they dump out down the hall, I swear to God, I'm getting off my chair, and I will  punch you in your face, Craig.  I'm looking at what's dump worthy.  There's a couple things they will dump out on.  Yeah? 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  Uh, Rick, go warn him now.  Blair!  I will walk down the hall and punch him in the head if he dumps out of anything in this  article today.  Oh, mentions of, uh, other programming?  Yeah.  Okay.  And warn Jeremy, too.  Yeah, this is, you know, let's not be ridiculous about, um, about what we can and can't say.  Bobby, what's going on?  Dude, what's going on?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Look, I gotta tell you, what did I lick the other guy's say?  What did I learn when I was on my vacation?  Yeah.  Oh, you learned how to ski.  Yeah.  You learned how to give away half your money. 
[00:09:30]  And I gotta tell you, a poor little schmuck from Huntington, you knock 10, and you knock  somebody else, apparently, because it costs you.  Shut up!  You are my hero, and now you're living in Bay Ridge.  I love you.  Shut up!  I just love you.  Dude, I got some real food rates to show you.  Come on out for a beer.  All right.  I need some money, too.  All right.  I'm going to the bush.  Bye.  Let's go to Tom.  This is all people commenting, and we haven't even read the article. 
[00:10:00]  I know.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Hey, Ed.  Yeah.  Congratulations on the most expensive threesome in the history of time.  Bunch of asses.  And guys.  Guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, getting Norton on us.  Where's Norton?  Is this true?  I got audio of Anthony leaving the courthouse last Monday afternoon.  You do?  Yeah.  Freedom! 
[00:10:30]  Man, there's a whole orchestra there.  Yeah.  I heard you set up an orchestra right on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  In between the paparazzi that was...  The paparazzi!  And had paparazzi following him.  This goes to show you how paparazzi oblivious I am.  Because right when we were walking out of the courtroom...  We'll get into all of this when we get back.  But I'm walking out of the courtroom with the ex. 
[00:11:00]  And we're walking down those huge steps.  And if you've never seen the courthouse in New York City, it's the same one at the end of The Godfather where...  Is it really the same one?  Yeah, where the guy, one of Corleone's guys, dressed like a cop, shoots the guy in the back and he falls down those steps.  It's those steps.  I didn't know that scene was...  Oh, that's those steps.  I didn't know that.  He had less pain in what happened to him and The Godfather rolling down those steps than I had walking down them.  Sean, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:11:30]  Hey, guys.  Welcome back.  I was just going to tell Anthony, if he's worth $100 million, I think the next three-way he's going to have is going to be with the Olsen twins.  A-hoo-ha!  A-hoo-ha!  A-hoo-ha!  A-hoo-ha!  Too much.  So, yeah, the cameras are going off, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And the ex goes, uh-oh.  So I'm like, huh?  And I see the cameras going.  I turn around to see who's behind me that they're taking pictures of.  I swear to God.  I'm like, who's here?  Must be a big case. 
[00:12:00]  Must be a big important case.  You know what?  Click, click, click.  You and I really are clueless as far as what's going on with this radio show.  I completely agree with you.  We just think we're doing a radio show for a couple of our pals.  We got no clue.  A few of my friends from the Harborfields days.  Right.  That's what I'm thinking.  And a few people from my family listen a little bit here and there.  There are guys out front snapping pictures like madmen.  And then we're walking down the sidewalk.  They're following.  And they're snapping pictures.  And then they get in, like, this one guy with a cane is walking by and he gets in the frame. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  So the guy with the cane goes, don't take pictures of me!  And hits the guy upside the head with his cane.  But these photographers are so, like, used to now suing that they get away with anything.  And they got balls.  The guy's like, you mother effer.  Hit me again, son of a bitch.  He's cursing at them.  And I'm just, like, smiling.  I don't care.  You know?  Walking.  And to the point where the photographers, when they finally got done at the end of the block, went, all right, thanks, man.  I'm like, yeah, okay.  Could have pulled the Sean Penn, you know, and grabbed the camera. 
[00:13:00]  That's funny.  I didn't want to end up back in the court building giving away any more money.  We'll tell you guys this much.  Anthony is a free man.  After how many years?  I don't even know how many years it's been.  This went on for two and a half.  Two and a half years.  Two and a half years.  You are finally divorced, my friend.  Two and a half years.  Are we supposed to throw you a party or something?  We could have one.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  Yeah, we could have some kind of little party.  Am I, like, the best man for your divorce party?  Am I supposed to do something here?  Yeah, you could. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  We've got to get him a fortune.  Yeah.  No, I think that's done.  Thank you.  You know something?  I crack the papers open, and I start reading.  And I'm like, you know, all right, there are some things in here that are a little racy.  But then I'm thinking, oh, my.  I'm thinking more saucy.  Saucy.  A little scandal.  There's some scandal and some sauce.  Another Long Island-based sex scandal.  A little saucy.  Like Joey Buttafuco. 
[00:14:00]  You know the pants?  Yeah, I came out with my Joey Buttafuco pants to comment to the press.  But I'm thinking, like, you know something?  We do this show.  It's not like we do a right-wing political program.  So, you know, I think it's almost expected of us clowns and the people that listen to this show.  But then I'm reading going, oh, my God.  Could you imagine having to read something like young boys or, you know, men coming in there?  Like, how do you come back to your show after it's like, yes, there were three men in the bed? 
[00:14:30]  Like, how do you come back from that?  You just leave the planet instead.  Two girls for every boy.  Tony, what's going on?  You can handle those comments.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, man.  Don't sweat it.  To quote Rodney from back to school, do you feel like you just got paroled?  Yeah.  100 million, my ass. 
[00:15:00]  100 mil.  Yeah.  And punch that fat bastard attorney on.  It's right in his fat gizzard neck.  Gizzard neck.  You rule, brother.  All right, Tony.  Shut up.  Let's go to Louis.  Louis.  Louis.  Hey, dudes.  Yeah.  Anthony's name is now, hi, I'm Elmer J. Kumia.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Again.  I'm Elmer J. Kumia.  Millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Again.  Hi, I'm Elmer J. Kumia.  I'm a millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Again.  I love that one. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, dude.  Do you want to do something to Anthony, Opie?  Get some zipper case.  Yeah.  Get some zipper case.  You want to do something to Anthony?  Yeah.  Give him back some of his money, you cheap bastard.  Well, we're worth 100 million each.  100 mil.  100 million.  Boy, 100 million and living in a tree house.  Who'd have thought it?  Which means my mansion will be twice as big as Anthony.  Right.  Hi, I'm Elmer J. Kumia.  I'm a millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  You were funny.  You were funny.  Don't...  Bye-bye, dude.  Look at Matt from Philly.  Everyone from the other city is going, what happened? 
[00:16:00]  We'll tell you.  We're going to read the articles in a couple minutes here.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, I need some advice.  All right.  How do I get my wife to bring a second girl into the bedroom?  Oh, and listen, guys, I got a question.  Jackass.  Is there going to be a line of HVAC vans going to the divorce party?  Two girls for every boy.  Later, guys.  All right.  Allegations.  No one wants to talk to me today.  Steve? 
[00:16:30]  Steve?  Steve.  Steve, you're on the air.  Is your name Steve?  It says, can I talk to Hugh Hefner?  Oh, yes.  Hello?  Very funny.  Oh, well.  All right.  Let's go to Richie.  Richie, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to congratulate Anthony on his divorce.  Okay.  Thank you.  And I'm also wondering, is he going to be on that program, The Bachelor, tonight?  See, we figured we'd give the listeners the first shot before we read the articles,  because I knew they'd have some good stuff today. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, Ant, you would think with a hundred million bucks, you could have picked a better sweater  to wear to court.  Sweater?  How long until Old Dirty shows up for a loan?  Let me explain something about what you were wearing in the shots that the paparazzi took.  Yes.  It was your NBC jacket that we got for free when we were doing the XFL thing, because we  showed up at Giant Stadium to tape a piece for the XFL game day.  And McMahon there.  Uh-huh.  Vince?  No.  Shane.  Shane. 
[00:17:30]  I just had a brain fart.  Shane O'Mac.  Shane O'Mac saw us and goes, dude, you guys can't tape TV looking like that.  So he ran and got us those jackets.  Yes.  You've been wearing it ever since.  Well, yeah, yeah.  It's nice, comfy, warm.  And when I noticed that they were finally, when I finally noticed they were taking pictures  of me, like it went through my head.  You know, I don't want the people that own this company, which is CBS, to see me wearing  an NBC jacket.  So I kind of flipped like the thing around a little bit.  No.  And it showed my cheap sweater. 
[00:18:00]  You can still tell that it was the NBC jacket.  I know.  What are you going to do?  Like I said, I don't have a clue.  I don't know.  I'm a loser.  What can I say?  George, what's going on?  Oh, hey.  Welcome back, guys.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Anthony, I got one question.  Yeah.  Are you going to resurrect, too, for Tuesday?  And Wednesday?  And Thursday?  You're very funny.  All right.  Shut up.  Dr. Martin Luther King checking in.  Yes.  Free at last. 
[00:18:30]  Free at last.  Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.  Thank you, doctor.  Oh, my pleasure.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Since you're, like, so rich and famous, can I borrow $200 before I get my check?  No problem.  Come on by.  Cool.  All right, bro.  That's funny.  Peter?  Peter?  Hello?  Yes.  Can we celebrate with a box of wine?  I got another idea for you.  How about some cleaning stuff to get the stink of Haradia's system? 
[00:19:00]  I'm the cleaning guy.  What's the cleaning stuff?  Just imagine how big a box of wine you can buy.  Oh, my God.  One the size of the refrigerator.  I'd have to take all the shelves out and just shove the box of wine in.  Yeah.  Jeez, man.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break?  Yeah, we'll read the articles.  We got two to read.  And then Ant will comment.  It's been a very, very interesting week. 
[00:19:30]  Everyone else started their radio show today talking about the Oscars, but this is way more  important.  Oh, believe me.  After this, we have plenty of your Oscar talk.  I think we're your Oscar show.  We are the official Oscar show, I believe.  Yes.  I'll tell you one thing.  Something really big happened at the Oscars last night.  Oh, really?  Really big.  I can't really figure it out, but I think black people could now vote.  Was that what happened?  Something big happened.  It was something important.  I realize that.  It's either black people can vote now or they don't have to sit in the back of the bus anymore. 
[00:20:00]  It was some kind of huge racial victory there.  Okay.  Maybe we could get Earl in here to explain why it's such a big deal.  Well, I can't wait.  He'll do it out of order.  He'll do it out of order.  Don't even get me started.  That's why Ant and I hate taking vacation because no matter who is left back at the station,  always F's up our show.  Supposedly, what, 55-gallon drum challenge that re-ran Friday?  Yeah.  Earl's playing segments out of place. 
[00:20:30]  Backwards.  Holy yes.  That's what we need to hear when we get back from vacation.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue next, right, Ant?  Right.  Two girls for every boy.  We've left out the entire country except for New York.  Yeah, I know.  We'll explain what happened with Anthony to the rest of the country in a couple of minutes  with these little newspaper articles, okay?  Great. 
[00:21:00]  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Opie and Anthony.  Who was drunk and quite strange.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Back from vacation.  Phone's ringing like crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Get Earl in here real fast.  Earl.  If you're just tuning in, after two and a half years, Anthony is a free man.  He's, uh...  Yes, the divorce is done.  The divorce is final. 
[00:21:30]  So it's a happy day.  Well, relatively speaking.  We've got to ask Earl a couple things real fast.  First, if I may, Opie, on behalf of the program, and I hope everyone's in agreement with me here,  Earl, I want to congratulate you on the Oscars last night.  What did I do?  I have no reason why I feel I should congratulate Earl and all the black people that I know,  but for some reason, it just seems like something I could do.  You know, with Sidney Poitier getting his lifetime achievement Oscar, and... 
[00:22:00]  Denzel.  Denzel and Halle Berry.  It just seems, uh, to me like, uh, it's a great day to be an African-American.  Earl, did...  Do you really think Denzel Washington should have won Best Actor?  No.  Of course not.  Mm-hmm.  Russell Crowe was unbelievable in that movie, but I think he's such a douchebag that they  didn't want to give it to him.  Oh, yes.  He spent the whole Oscars, uh, telecast, by the way, uh, trying to pick up women.  Anyone else notice that?  Picking up chicks.  He presented to Halle Berry.  Right.  And, uh, when, when she finally got off the stage after the speech, but we have clips of 
[00:22:30]  them, we'll go into it later, um, he gives her a hug and starts talking to her.  Who isn't watching going, oh, boy, here he goes.  She's going to be the next one.  You're just thinking, isn't this good, because this guy's just banged everything in Hollywood.  Right.  Come up to me, room.  So, so, Earl, uh, could you explain what happened with, uh, Halle Berry?  Oh, she was a mess.  She was a complete mess.  Yeah, but why was she...  She was a glubbering mess.  Well, I don't understand what she was getting at last night. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, what was the, um...  What's the big deal?  Well, she's the first black actress to win the Academy Award.  So?  For Best Actress.  And why is that a big deal?  I can understand this.  The first one?  I can understand my stone.  The first actress has ever won the Academy Award.  I could understand milestones.  As Opie was saying before, things like voting, equal rights as far as, uh, drinking fountains,  eating, and buses go.  You know, the freedom to go out on the street and not be hit by, uh... 
[00:23:30]  I was confused.  Tons of water pressure, you know.  Things like that, I understand, are complete victories for civil rights.  I was confused because I tuned in as she was going through that spiel.  I didn't know she won an award.  I thought we had to get rid of, uh, half the fountains in New York.  Oh, God.  Now that, I must ring a bell for.  I thought something really big was going on.  Earl, are you guys allowed to vote now?  He said Opie, I believe they have been allowed to vote for a while. 
[00:24:00]  Earl, when was the black man given the vote?  Uh, do you remember?  Voting Rights Act of 1964.  64?  64, that was...  That's it?  You cannot discriminate based on...  Wow.  That's some ethnicity.  How about that?  So, she was the first one to win.  First act, black actress to win.  But she's not that black.  Yeah, now we gotta go into this.  It's not like the mom from What's Happening, uh, won the best actress. 
[00:24:30]  Or good times.  I didn't see Florida sitting there.  My baby won the half good times.  I think it would have been, uh, very impressive for, uh, for your people, uh, Earl.  For your peeps.  If she was, if she was ultra black.  Right.  Her mom is whiter than my mom.  Yeah.  She is.  She doesn't want to acknowledge that fact.  She is so Irish.  Why does she get up there and say, hey, it was all the white that's in me that made me  such a great, uh, actress. 
[00:25:00]  I don't know about that.  Why do they always have to lean the black way when they're half and half, Earl?  Did you see her thanking her mom?  Oh, glory be, I can't believe me little girl, one.  Don't you know?  It's a proud moment for the family, for the whole family.  That's what she looked like.  She's all rosy red.  I didn't know her mom.  Hey, glory be.  Her mom, I'm not, I'm not joking.  Her mom is whiter than my mom.  Her mom, whiter than Sidney Poitier's wife.  Right.  Who I thought, up to that point, had been the whitest woman I'd seen on the Oscars so far. 
[00:25:30]  Wow.  Sidney Poitier, breaking down the barriers.  Can't we enjoy the moment for one?  Oh, that was Sidney Poitier.  Sidney Poitier.  I thought that was Nelson Mandela.  I thought he went into acting.  No, you, no, that's distinguished actor Sidney Poitier.  I look like Nelson Mandela.  I don't know.  Who got a Lifetime Achievement Award.  And, uh, wow.  He got the, he got the wife and he got the, uh, the children there, the girls, very pretty girls. 
[00:26:00]  He has a couple of daughters.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah, sugar.  But did Denzel deserve the win?  I didn't think so.  No?  No, Russell Crowe.  Russell Crowe.  He was really unbelievable and beautiful mind.  Enough with Russell Crowe, though.  Jesus Christ.  All right, Earl.  Well, congratulations, I guess.  I don't know what for.  I don't either, but I feel now, you know, you look at the goddamn newspapers, I feel like  something huge was, uh, overcame.  Earl, congratulations, by the way. 
[00:26:30]  Uh, you're a movie one that you started.  For best animation.  Oh.  Shrek, Shrek.  That's all I can think about.  Where's Donkey?  Adam, what's going on?  Oh, and hey, how you doing?  Listen.  Halle Berry is, is, is, is, is white.  She's not black.  She's awful.  And, and she, Esther Roll is black.  Esther Roll.  She's black.  Halle Berry is just as much black as she is white. 
[00:27:00]  She's right in the middle.  She's not one or the other.  And, and, uh, Ed brought up a good point in the back office with Sidney Poitier.  Sidney Poitier.  He gave his, uh, speech.  Poitier.  Gave a very, uh, nice speech.  You notice how everyone was overpronouncing Poitier.  Sidney Poit-hat-o-tay.  Poit-hat-o-tay.  I appreciate the efforts of our fine African actor, Sidney Poit-hat-o-tay.  And then he's, he's thanking all the, uh, black actors that came before him. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  See, that's the thing you gotta do.  Now, now, Sidney Poitier worked with many white actors.  He was that crossover actor, the one that really did, uh, he was a mainstream leading  man and he was a black man.  Right, Earl?  Yes.  You could, uh, call me on anything I'm, I'm saying.  So, he pretty much made his bones, uh, uh, acting with a lot of white people.  Right?  Pretty much, yes.  But he gets up there and then you have to, you have to identify and, uh, treat with respect 
[00:28:00]  some of the actors that came before you that, that were pretty much stereotyped and cast,  uh, uh, in the traditional stereotypical black roles of a mammy or a tap dancer.  Well, they showed some order.  Like that.  So, when he gets up there and talks about, you know, Rod Steiger and working with that  and then, you know, but you can't forget about, you know, old Chicken Bone Johnson who came  before, remember, old Chicken Bone Johnson and Fatback Ned. 
[00:28:30]  Remember Fatback Ned and Chitlin Charles I worked with back in 1940.  Forty.  I want to identify these people and realize they made a sacrifice and opened the door for me.  Sidney Potate Latte.  Don't forget about...  Sidney Potate Latte.  Don't forget about Papa Fried Jones. 
[00:29:00]  Ah.  I remember working in the early days before the big crossover was made with Big Johnson Johnson.  Yes.  Let's go to Mike.  I think Mike's pissed at us.  Conroy Cracklin' Corn Corrigan.  You know, you've got to give respect to the people that came before you, and I appreciated 
[00:29:30]  that Sidney Potate Latte.  Don't forget about that.  Don't forget about Collie Green Earl.  I remember...  Why do you have to do that, Earl?  We got it.  He was a pioneer.  I remember Bill Bull Weevil Johnson.  Bojangles.  No, Bull Weevil.  The little critters that lived in the cotton.  Earl.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  My two favorite crackers. 
[00:30:00]  Welcome back, gentlemen.  What's up?  What's up, Mike?  What's going on?  Listen, I love you guys.  I can't get mad.  I'll call Matt, but then he went on that rave, and I can't even be mad at him, because  I know people with that name.  Oh, yeah?  Jimmy Pinto Bean Johnson.  Richard Blackout P. Jackson.  Yeah.  You got to adopt some type of food product to your name.  Yeah.  It's great.  Back Jenkins, all them people. 
[00:30:30]  I remember Henry Hollomelon Johnson.  We call him that because he used to holler a melon.  Hey, Andy, cut it out, man.  I'm trying to be mad at you.  Now, cut it out.  Remember Jimmy Candyman Conroy?  I remember old candy yam back before the dolls were brought down.  Don't forget, Cotton Club Joe.  Yeah.  No, but listen.  Holly Berry is black.  Don't deny it.  She's black.  I mean, she had a white.  The white mother thing kind of threw me off. 
[00:31:00]  I was like, wait a minute.  Mike.  Mike, her mom was very white.  Yo, her mom was transparent.  Exactly.  Her mom is really whiter than my mom.  And it was very, you know, but honestly, if you'd have brought her home to dinner, you  know, they'd be like, hey, who this black woman you bringing to dinner?  You think?  So that's why they keep calling her black.  I mean, she get pulled over.  Well, let's not bring her the pulled over thing.  Yeah, well, her driving's a little.  Well, that's how you know she's a black woman, because black women can't drive. 
[00:31:30]  Wow.  Hey, what?  I ain't saying to say it.  I ain't saying to say it.  It's not like, but it's not like Callie Berry's like Jackie Robinson.  No.  Yeah, or Jackie Joyner-Kersey, but hey.  Oh, a good friend of mine, Tyrone Pitfeet-Johnson, who I acted with before, Rod Steiger.  I can't even be mad at you.  They call me Tenderloin Tibbs.  Hey, hey, hey, boy.  Hey, Anthony's a free man. 
[00:32:00]  Go ahead, bruh.  Let it go.  Free at last.  Free at last.  Thank God almighty, I'm free at last.  Yo, man, y'all be easy.  I'm going to listen to myself on the radio, you fools.  Thanks, man.  By the way, a lot of people saying you don't know crap about the black culture.  Uh-oh.  Uh, blacks technically got the right to vote around 1870 with the 15th Amendment, Earl.  I heard it was the 14th.  I don't know, but then they ended in 16th.  The voting rights.  No, you know what it was?  It was that a lot of people were saying, all right, boy, you got the right to vote. 
[00:32:30]  But you can't vote here.  But you come in here and you're going to have yourself a heap of trouble, boy.  You know how it was back then, Earl, right?  Jason from Park Ridge, New Jersey writes,  Shouldn't Halle Berry be known as the first zebra to win an Oscar?  Oh, God.  Stop it.  All right.  So there you have it.  Halle Berry, Anthony.  I don't care.  I remember working with Bobby Bread Puddin' Biggins back in 1945. 
[00:33:00]  Broken down the doors.  Breaking down the doors.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Call Kool-Aid Curtis.  All right.  Listen, I read the paper this morning.  I'm a cop.  I thought, with all the black thing going on, we're not allowed to lock black people up anymore.  Oh, stop it.  Why the hell does it have to take this turn?  It always has to go there.  You know, we tread the line.  We're talking about this in an open fashion.  That's why we're worth $100 million each. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  We know how far to take it.  But it was very nice seeing that fine actor, Sidney Poitotardete, up, giving a very eloquent speech.  Jay, what's going on?  Anthony, forgetting the whole blind line.  Blind shitlin' melon.  Blind cracklin' lightning.  Lightning jolt.  Come on.  That's this formula that says that the all-time black jazz singers or blues singers and actors  had to have some affliction, like a disease, a food, and then a name. 
[00:34:00]  So, you know, they tried it home.  It would be something like tuberculosis ribs, Johnson.  Well, after nothing, talking about Halle Berry, did you see Nicole Kidman's face when she won the award?  Shoeless ham hock habit.  Although being shoeless ain't no affliction, unless you're walking on sharp pebbles.  And the lightning, the lightning series, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Jack.  Cotton picker Calhoun's calling in, Anthony. 
[00:34:30]  What the hell did we do to him?  Yes, sir?  Shut up.  I just wanted to, I want to be wishing a big congratulations to our man there.  It's a testament to how far we come now.  And he got the right wife next to her.  I don't believe this is a black gentleman.  Yeah, I think he's joking.  I think we're being fooled.  Nah.  I think it's a goof.  Jesus, Rick. 
[00:35:00]  You sure know how to put the brakes on everything.  Hey, look at the one Rick's holding up.  Hey, where is the Halle Berry speech?  Yeah, we got to hear that.  Sidney Protatoracite Protractor.  All right.  Why don't we play the Halle Berry speech?  Aren't we supposed to talk about your divorce?  Yeah, I know.  We got sidetracked again.  We got articles to read about this.  All right.  Well, we got to play the Halle Berry speech, Anthony.  All right? 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  Okay.  Sorry.  I was looking down at one of the articles that were written on my little divorce there.  Yeah.  And I just saw some words.  Like, key words get me.  Like what?  I don't remember?  Yeah.  Things like that.  I have an explanation for that.  Thank you.  Yeah, wait.  Because, uh...  Yes.  I don't recall.  All of a sudden, I turned into Reagan on the stand.  Yes.  Well, it was me, Mommy, and Charles. 
[00:36:00]  The instant feedback going crazy about your divorce, Dan, from Yonkers.  Which took longer to get?  Divorce or syndication?  Just wondering.  And then Dan from Hoboken.  If you have a divorce party for Anthony, will he remember the date of it?  Shut up, Jackass!  I can explain that.  Please.  Yes.  I...  I don't recall.  When?  Who?  Who's Nancy?  All right.  Well, it was a big moment at the Oscars, so why don't we... 
[00:36:30]  Why don't we finish...  Why don't we finish...  Yes.  We'll finish up with Halle Berry, and we'll get to the Antimorce thing, okay?  Okay.  Halle Berry.  We'll play this from last night.  Yeah.  I mean, we gotta go into the other highlights about the Oscars, too, man.  Oh, some of the clothing, of course.  Uma Thurman looked like she was gonna breastfeed the entire audience.  Did you see that globe?  Holy S.  That globe just falling out?  Like, who knew she had very nice canage?  And I think Ethan Hawke is breastfeeding, because you see the side of his face? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, what happened there?  What happened?  Did he take a boob to the face or something?  He got clocked in the side of the head.  What's that about?  I don't know.  Oh, and then the most horrific scene at the Oscars last night?  Uh-huh.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Yeah.  Oh, what the F?  She doesn't have big breasts, right?  We all know that.  Which is fine.  That's why Brad Pitt broke up with her, by the way.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  He wanted the big Jennifer Aniston ones?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  So, the last thing she should do, and believe me, I'm no fashion expert, is wear something 
[00:37:30]  that, first of all, it compressed the top of her boobs.  At least you weren't slouching as you walked out of the courtroom.  No, no.  Try not to slouch.  She slouched, and then she had this thing that was pushing the top of her boobs, made a big  dent in them, and made them look even flatter and flabbier.  She had fried eggs.  They were awful.  They were fried eggs.  Ugh.  Over easy kind of thing.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  With the runny yolk.  Ugh.  And then she was slouched forward.  She has old lady calcium deficient back.  She does.  She's got like that calcium disease.  Very good, Rick.  Oosh.  That was horrific.  What was she thinking?  But it could have, was that surpassed by Jennifer Connelly's mustache?  Because that surprised the hell out of me.  Yeah, she went down on my hotness meter last night.  You know, you know, you go to the Oscar, bitch. 
[00:38:30]  Shave.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You might win.  She had like a mustache.  But when made up for her, it was Cameron Diaz's nip.  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  And anyone else notice how the director's in another room going,  panning.  Oh, yes, pan in as fast as you can and make sure it's not noticeable.  Yeah.  At one point, it was just her big head on the screen.  Right.  All right, here's the Halle Berry speech.  Halle Berry winning for Best Actress.  Do you have your clips ready?  For, uh... 
[00:39:00]  What?  What?  For, what was it?  Monsters, Inc.?  Monsters, Ball.  No.  Monsters, Ball.  I know.  Shut up.  Was she good in Monsters, Ball, Earl?  Yeah, she was really good.  Her movie was very good.  Good movie, right?  And she's naked in the movie.  Ah, well, that's an Oscar-worthy right there.  I had sex with a white man.  Mm-hmm.  So she wins.  Stan from Hoboken writes,  Did Halle Berry really mention Jada Pinkett  and that chick from Housevirista  got her crew back as great actresses? 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Just before Best Actor category,  Will Smith disappeared  and Ethan Hawke developed a big Bruce  on the side of his face.  Coincidence?  Why would they be fighting him?  Am I missing something?  Ethan Hawke and Will Smith got into it backstage.  That's why they didn't show Will during the Best Actor award, only a picture of him.  Interesting.  Is this really a story?  No, the picture of him was because he was in makeup for the Muhammad Ali thing,  so they just showed a picture of him attached to the thing. 
[00:40:00]  No.  That sounds silly.  No, Rick.  Rick, that sounds silly.  No, they had a picture of Will Smith because he wasn't in the audience anymore.  They always show the live actor in the audience.  Right.  Definitely.  Good Hollywood dirt.  All right, here's Halle Berry.  This was a huge moment last night, I guess.  Oh, it goes on and on, too.  Who wasn't cringing like, oh, they're going to start the music.  They're going to start the shut the F up.  We're going to commercial music. 
[00:40:30]  Halle Berry.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, no. 
[00:41:00]  I'm sorry.  Liga, please.  You cannot find a man.  What's allowed to do?  It's so much bigger than me.  This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge.  Lena Holm.  Yep.  Diane Carroll.  I'm so enjoying hitting you.  The women that stand beside me, Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, soccer box, and it's for every 
[00:41:30]  nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance, because this door tonight has  been opened.  What's going on?  Oh, I'm calling you, lady.  Thank you.  I'm so honored.  I'm so honored.  I'm going to thank the Academy for choosing me to be the vessel, but which is blessing my flow. 
[00:42:00]  Thank you.  I want to thank you.  Merciful craft.  My manager, Vincent Cerencione, he's been with me for 12 long years, and you've fought  every fight, and you've loved me when I've been up, but more importantly, you've loved  me when I've been down.  Well, calm down, help.  You have been a manager, a friend, and the only father I've ever known.  Really, I love you that much. 
[00:42:30]  I want to thank my mom who's giving me the strength to fight every single day to be who  I want to be, and give me the courage to dream.  Let's go, while we're young.  This dream might be happening.  It's just something impossible for me.  I love you, mom, so much.  Thank you.  My husband.  You're a girl.  It's just the joy of my life in India.  Thank you for giving me peace, because only with the peace that you've brought me have  I've been allowed to go to places that I never even knew I could go. 
[00:43:00]  Shut up.  Thank you.  I love you in India.  You're a...  It's all.  I want to thank Lionsgate.  Thank you.  A Moulignan.  Mike Pasternak, Tom Ortenberg, for making sure everybody knew about this little tiny movie.  Thank you for believing in me.  Um, our director, Mark Forrester, you're a genius.  A big dick black.  You're a genius.  Go!  And you saw!  This movie-making experience was magical.  Where somebody put this retard out of his misery.  Because of you.  Georgia!  You believed in me.  Georgia!  You trusted me. 
[00:43:30]  And you gently guided me to very scary places.  Thank you.  I want to thank Ivana Chubbic.  Okay, terrific.  I could have never figured out who the heck this lady was without you.  Okay, terrific.  I love you.  Thank you.  I want to thank Lee Daniels, our producer.  Thank you for giving me this chance.  For believing that I could do it.  And now, tonight, I have this.  Thank you.  I want to thank my agent, CAO, John Kieberman, especially.  I have to thank my agent, Kevin Uvain. 
[00:44:00]  Thank you.  Thank you for never kicking me out and sending me somewhere else.  Thank you.  You used your tongue earlier, and you turned it on her head.  People that I know I need to thank.  Um, my lawyers, Neil Meyer.  Thank you.  Okay, wait a minute.  I've got to take this 74 years here.  Okay, I've got to take this time.  I've got to thank my lawyer, Neil Meyer, for making the deal, Doug Stone.  Um, I need to thank, um, lastly, and not leastly, I have to thank Spike Lee for putting me in my very first film and believing in me. 
[00:44:30]  Oprah Winfrey, for being the best role model any girl can have.  Joe Silver, thank you.  And thank you to Warren Beatty.  Thank you so much for being my mentors and believing in me.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're going to kiss my ass or not?  Quiet, quiet, quiet.  Stay out the bushes. 
[00:45:00]  Come on.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Kill me.  Come on.  Kill me.  I'm here.  Come on.  Do it now.  Kill me.  That's how I felt, man.  Kill me.  Shut up.  Oh, my God. 
[00:45:30]  We're on your side, Hallie.  They completely lose any perspective on what the hell is important in life.  Like, it's a big moment for you.  Everyone that loses their effing mind up there, it's a big moment for you, you know?  Keep it in perspective.  You get up there.  Bye!  I hear them!  It's a really funny thing!  It's a...  Oh.  It's like, no one watching.  I like the people that can get up there and go, hey, you know, this is great, man. 
[00:46:00]  Got up, did a movie, and I won this.  Thank you.  You know, just easy.  That speech went on.  How long was that?  Four and a half minutes.  Oh, God.  How long was Denzel's?  Yeah, he was pretty casual.  Probably told him, cut it short.  The bitch took up all your time.  You know what?  Someone's going to get pissed, but this is exactly what I was thinking, too, last night.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hallie Berry was crying so much, I didn't know if she won an Oscar or if she was raped by a white guy. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, God damn it.  I swear, though.  I was like, did something happen to her in the bathroom?  What happened?  Yes.  Oh!  Sean, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Why don't y'all bring up Woody Allen and his wife, man?  You know?  His daughter?  Hold on.  Woody Allen, first of all, was hilarious last night, but the whole time you're thinking about...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, he married his daughter, Paisley.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye. 
[00:47:00]  You know that clip of Hallie Berry, like, crying like that?  It was eerily reminiscent of me walking out of the courtroom.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Wait, shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  Where the kisses are.  Thank you, yeah.  Don't just stare at it. 
[00:47:30]  Eat it.  Come and death on our floor.  Yeah.  Death that is new.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Very happy to be here.  Could you shut up?  Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.  They're all pink on the inside.  I'm on the roof.  I'm on the roof.  Three is all pink on the roof.  Are you there?  Oh, please. 
[00:48:00]  Very funny.  Let our rendezvous.  Thank you.  Three is all pink on the roof.  Very nice.  Welcome back.  Two girls for every.  Two girls for every.  Three is all pink on the roof.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  Can we get into the saucy material next?  It's a little saucy, a little racy.  Should we have a disclaimer for the parents that are out there listening with young children?  Perhaps some.  If you don't want to hear about aunt's divorce, you're going to want to turn off the radio right now. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, please.  Yes.  Yes.  We're going to read the articles next, Anthony.  No more tangents, okay?  We've got to promise.  We've got to promise our audience.  I know.  No more tangents.  Did anybody see the after Oscar party with The View?  The girls from The View?  I hadn't watched The View in quite some time.  And we always goof on Star Jones, the size of Star Jones.  But when she was sitting on the couch, they had all of them in these black dresses. 
[00:49:00]  Like, look, it's the Oscars and we're getting all dressed up.  So they're all in these black dresses.  And the rest of the hags that do the show, you know, at least their dress is sleek on their frail frames.  And the dink didn't look bad.  What's her name there?  Lisa Ling.  Oh, Lisa Ling.  She looked pretty good.  But then Star Jones is sprawled out on a couch with other people.  I swear to God, and this is no joke, all I could think of was the scene with that little creature crawling all over Jabba the Hutt. 
[00:49:30]  Like, Jabba's just sitting there and you can't take your eyes off Jabba because Jabba's huge.  And then, like everyone else, was that little creature that would run all over Jabba.  I swear to God, there was one of those little friggin' birds at the beach that end up on the hippo's back picking mites off of them or something.  And I got some audio of Star Jones.  I mean, whatever, I'll do what I want.  I'll do what I want.  Great South Park. 
[00:50:00]  I just hope Star Jones sweats sometime soon so she doesn't explode.  Oh, she was sitting there on the couch.  Every time they went to her, you gasped and went, oh, my God, that is a huge, giant woman.  Someone get her on a treadmill before she explodes.  Treadmill?  She needs to sweat.  Oof.  All right.  Wow, J.R. is going to yell at us.  J.R., what's wrong?  Yo, man, I mean, how could y'all dis Halle Berry?  Y'all got to understand, it's been 74 years. 
[00:50:30]  She's the first black woman that ever won an Academy Award.  So I think after 74 years, she deserved five minutes to express how she felt.  I haven't been keeping track.  I just, I think she should have won because she did a good job with that movie.  Well, I'm saying, last year when Julia Roberts won, I didn't hear y'all dissing her.  I'm listening to y'all all the time.  Oh, please, grab the tape.  I didn't hear y'all dissing her at all about the speech she made.  J.R., grab the tape of last year's show.  We rag her on a daily basis.  With that big mouth. 
[00:51:00]  With a huge horse mouth now.  Maybe it was cute once.  Not anymore.  Her and the golf ball eye, Susan Sarandon.  We goof on her all the time.  Don't worry, J.R., we make fun of Whitey, too.  We make fun of Whitey a lot more than Blacky.  Okay, but I'm just saying, this is like a, that was like historical.  You know, a Black actor and a White actor, they both won it.  I know a lot of the White people in the audience was pissed off.  Russell Crowe was pissed off.  Who cares?  Russell Crowe is pissed off every day of his life.  He's just an angry man.  Halle Berry, what an effing body. 
[00:51:30]  Mmm, God damn.  I like that.  I don't know y'all guys anyway, but I was just pissed off because y'all was hating on her because she won.  We ain't a player-hater.  We're player-participators.  It's just, it was weird, though, to see Halle Berry's mom in the audience.  Oh, J.R. is listening to himself now.  Now he's listening.  He doesn't care.  He just wants to be on the radio.  I am so very proud of you, me daughter.  What a great job you done, winning the Oscar and all. 
[00:52:00]  Get me a drink, don't you know?  Oh, I did say that.  Halle Berry's mom looks like Judi Dench.  Yeah.  All right.  See, now everyone wants to talk about Oscars.  People get very, very upset.  We'll get back to the Oscars, Anthony, but we've got to do your thing next, okay?  Ah, great.  I will read both articles.  You've got your little bell over there, and when you want to comment, you comment.  Okay?  All right.  All right, we'll do that next.  Ants Divorce, next.  You guys are mean.  We're coughing down delivery, my friend. 
[00:52:30]  I don't have kids.  I want porno, I want porno on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off, because you have kids.  All you people with your children make me effing sick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're psychotic.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including Philly! 
[00:53:00]  We're not out of town.  We're hearing things about Philly once again.  Good things.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You know, you make fun.  A little bit.  A little bit.  We're a little more gooder than we were last month, is what I'm hearing.  Yeah.  Don't have details, because the company doesn't subscribe to ratings anymore.  Yeah, for some reason.  I hope that's remedied soon.  Thank God they don't subscribe to ratings anymore.  Yeah.  But if you're in Philly or somewhere else outside of New York, here's the number for you.  866-277-4WOW. 
[00:53:30]  Finally, we can read the articles and get into Anthony's divorce.  Yes, yes.  After two and a half years, Anthony is a free man.  Two and a half years in the making.  But, um, so, uh, look, hold on, just two seconds.  I don't want to kill everybody on this, but I gotta find out what is going on here online, too.  Come on.  Come on, there's plenty of time for me in the barrel, believe me.  But when I see, when I look up and see Carl, says, saw Opie and Sandy on Kiss Cam at the 
[00:54:00]  Islander game.  What?  What?  What is that?  So anyway.  What is it?  Anthony, while we're on the kiss.  Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  Ah, nah, nah, nah.  What?  I want to talk to Carl about you on the Kiss Cam.  Come on.  Where is, uh, Carl?  Hey, Carl, what's up, man?  I was at the Islander game this weekend, and, uh, I saw some guy in a suede jacket with 
[00:54:30]  long blonde hair.  Yeah.  He was on the Kiss Cam, and he was, uh, he was kissing Rick's sister.  I think it was Opie.  You said that behind the net, right?  Right at the corner?  I think it was you.  I don't know.  I know you guys have been, uh, you've been wrecking on Anthony there with the divorce.  That was pretty gay.  That's cute.  Yeah.  You tell them to, like, you tell them to, like, go on camera, or they just got you?  I think that was, uh, I think that was one of my brothers. 
[00:55:00]  We all look alike.  Yeah.  What is the, uh, Kiss Cam, though?  What is it?  What?  What is the Kiss Cam?  What?  Rick, do you know what this is?  Because Opie's not going to tell me.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  What does it look like?  Oh, Rick, your mic's not on.  Usually I know when to turn your mic on.  Oh.  What does it look like?  Hold on, hold on.  You know the big boys they have at stadiums and all that stuff?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Be cool.  Pucker up and kiss my pass. 
[00:55:30]  Pooza.  Pooza.  Pooza.  Stop.  It's not about me.  I just want to know what the Kiss Cam is.  What does it look like?  It's got to be on the big jumbotron, the big screen that they have at the stadium.  And they have cameras panning the audience constantly.  All right.  I can totally picture it.  Anyone who's been to a game has seen this.  Like, you see, like, the Budweiser fan of the game.  Right.  And they put this wacky-looking person up there.  Uh-huh.  Look at him.  Hey, there's a big fan.  He's got the hat on and his shirt's on and he's woo.  But he can't seem to find the camera until the last minute, right when they cut away. 
[00:56:00]  Well, this one is filled with a heart.  Oh, is it a cheap, like, a bad wedding videographic?  Yeah, or like a Valentine's card.  Big Valentine's card.  Or like a big pumpkin or something with a cutout.  Oh, pumpkin, I get it.  Oh, a pumpkin joke.  All right, I'll bring the movie for it.  Oh, do I make you horny?  What?  So it's the heart. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  And they put couples in there.  Happy and love couples.  So couples that are at the game go in the heart.  They put you on video and you're in the heart on the big screen.  And they freeze it there for the entire crowd to see.  Oh, they freeze.  It's a big heart on the Jumbotron.  And then the cameraman, they pick out couples, Anthony.  Right.  Too bad you can't do the kiss cam.  Can't get three on the Jumbotron.  Oh, shut up, you dick.  Hey, at least he didn't beat Frank Harry with him that game. 
[00:57:00]  This one's just for couples.  Yeah, imagine if you brought Gary to that game.  I hope he had a young boy.  And then they go from like couple to couple and then they put you on the spot and you can  either be a deke or you can like, you know, do a little peck thing.  And sometimes they get really funny and they put two guys on the Jumbotron.  Oh, and then what are you going to do?  And the whole audience wonders if those two are going to kiss.  Oh, sometimes, you know, they think they got a couple, but it turns out to be a brother  and sister. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, again, they're not going to kiss.  They're not going to kiss.  Not in public, anyway.  Oh, so you're there on the kiss cam at the Islander game on, I don't know, when was the wild  game?  Saturday, I guess?  Is it a tie-in with one of the kiss radio stations?  No, no, no.  Oh, okay.  So maybe that would have been an ironic little twist to the whole thing.  Look, hope he's on a different station's little promotional device.  No, no, no.  Then they could have like, you know, every city has a jamming station. 
[00:58:00]  You got to jam your schlong home on the camera.  I hear we lost our jamming station here in New York.  Yeah?  Or did we gain one?  No, they just flipped.  They flipped to what?  Hip-hop.  Hip-hop.  But that was jamming.  Yeah.  Yeah?  So now it's hip-hop with a different name?  Oh.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Dan, can I read the articles, please?  Well, I guess we're to that portion of the program.  Oh, my God. 
[00:58:30]  What is this about?  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  One more for Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, what do they spell out that copy for you phonetically when you read those things  for the commercials?  You're like pronouncing every little syllable.  Because I hate doing those things.  They're making you do them now, though, aren't they?  Yeah, and what happens is, you know, they're going to realize how bad the acting is, and  they're going to get someone else to do it.  All right.  Well, you're getting there.  I'm a smart man.  You're getting there, then.  They should take them off really quick for you.  They're horrible.  The latest one that we did for Hotwire. 
[00:59:00]  We love Hotwire, but they give us these scripts.  We're not actors like Halle Berry.  Like Halle Berry and Denzel Washington.  We should have our own Earl, now that all the doors have been broken down.  We'll have Earl do some of the commercials, and he can start acting in them.  Maybe win an award.  Yeah, just sit back and laugh at our commercial reads.  You should do the Spanish ones, though, Opie.  Well, if they were smart, they would let us do it live, because for some reason they  work a little better live.  Hey, were you kissing when they got you on the kiss cam?  I'm like, did they freeze it in mid-kiss? 
[00:59:30]  I don't know what happened.  You know what happened.  No, I really don't.  Stop it.  I don't look up at the Jumbotron.  You didn't look at your faces on the kiss cam?  No, I didn't want to look at my face.  So you weren't sure?  Did they freeze it during like a...  Like a little pucker?  This ass-wipe cameraman.  Ass-wipe.  We sit down low, and every game, he's trying to get me on the stupid kiss cam.  And every time, I'm like, no, I don't want to be on the kiss cam.  Right.  This time around, he, uh, you know, he surprised me.  Got you on the kiss cam. 
[01:00:00]  Look at this, Frank.  So what if Opian standing around the kiss cam at the Coliseum?  Ant was on the taking it up the A on divorce court cam on Monday.  You jackass.  They freeze-framed me crying.  Hey, Ope, what's next?  Wedding proposal during Squirrel?  Well, you can score on one leg from Jersey.  You have been tall.  Score on.  Very nice, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Why is it about me?  It's not.  It's not about me today, Anthony.  It's about the Oscars.  No?  No.  Damn it.  You're avoiding the, uh, inevitable here.  Trying.  Uh, I know.  We're trying to get to 520.  Uh, Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Uh, I was just wondering if these articles fall into the Bitches That'll Get You category.  It could be a Bitches That'll Get You, Sucks To Be You, Unlucky Lottery, possibly.  Yeah, one of those.  All right, right. 
[01:01:00]  All right, Jeff, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Hmm.  All right.  Are you ready yet?  A little play on words are really funny.  Jock shocks in court.  I see that headline.  Play on the whole shock jock thing, Opie.  Look, they turned it around.  Jock shocks in court.  Instead of shock jock.  What shocking that's going on?  Shocking.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Then we got, uh... 
[01:01:30]  It's a Bitches Daddy kitchen.  And the other headline's Radio Raunch Man in R-rated Divorce.  Radio Raunch Man.  It's a Bitches Daddy.  It's the Raunch Man Show.  Waddle Doodle.  I'm the Raunch Man.  It's a Bitches Daddy kitchen.  Waddle Doodle.  You're listening to more of the Raunch Man Show.  Bone dry, smuggling bone.  Maureen, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[01:02:00]  How you doing?  All right.  Anthony, did you take your girlfriend down to the village this afternoon to celebrate your,  uh, ending nuptials?  Uh, yes, we did go and, uh, say we took another play.  I, uh, thought that was you because I saw you rubbing an extremely young girl's ass like  Mr. Miyagi doing the wax on.  How many seats did Anthony take up at the Janis Joplin show?  Just two.  Oh, I threw him up at the bar.  All right.  He was up at the bar.  But he had a very nice sweater on, though.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:02:30]  One of my nice sweaters.  I went to see, um...  Thank you, Maureen.  I went to see Love Janis.  Yeah.  Said, uh, Janis Joplin, uh, is based on the letters she wrote back to her family.  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  And I'm terrible at names, so I'm not going to remember one of them.  But, uh, the woman that sings, uh, in it, sings all, some of Janis' old songs.  Really good.  Was it your mom?  Because I was, no, it wasn't my mom singing Janis Joplin.  I was actually, I'm actually going to send my mother to the show so she can see how it's  supposed to be done. 
[01:03:00]  Really good.  It's down on, uh, Bleeker.  Bleeker.  Down on Bleeker Street here in, uh, lovely Manhattan.  So if you get a chance, Love Janis.  Very good show.  All right.  With double seats.  No.  What?  I only had two seats.  I wasn't asking.  She's a very young girl.  Roughing her ass.  Like Mr. Miyagi.  Like Mr. Miyagi.  Unbelievable.  All right.  People are jackasses. 
[01:03:30]  I am so entrenched in the barrel today.  I am so deep in the barrel.  You really thought that kiss on a Jumbotron thing was going to get you out of it?  I was hoping for a bit of a distraction.  Look, I'll admit it.  It was very faggy and I, what are you going to do though?  I know.  What are you going to do?  Eh, you got to, you know, be on the kiss cam.  I was on the kiss cam.  There you go.  At least I wasn't getting hit in the head by a hockey puck.  Ah.  Could be fatal.  Talk about unlucky lottery, huh?  Yeah.  All right, man.  We better take a break and get into this next. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, man.  You interrupted.  Hold on.  If you listen closely, you can hear people screaming.  Dude.  You can actually hear the listeners screaming at you.  They're all yelling, quit stalling.  Not at me.  What?  Dude.  Playback to take.  Look, how did this break start?  Let's get into the divorce.  You had to go to Carl.  Um, I don't remember.  The Carl thing was no big deal.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Now they're all mad at you.  Look.  What?  Paul, what's up?  Would you two whores please tell the damn story? 
[01:04:30]  I've been sitting here for an hour and a half waiting.  Yeah, what?  You know what, you guys?  You should be fired.  Fired.  See you.  All right, bye.  You know what?  We can give them a little something as we go to break, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, because we need some time here.  Oh, okay.  We've got to play Stephen Lynch's altar boy song.  Yeah.  Well, it seems like there was a lot of fondling going on while we were on break.  Well, the church seems to have identified there's a little problem going on. 
[01:05:00]  They're finally identifying?  With priests touching young boys.  What does it take to finally recognize?  Recognize.  I don't know.  So we'll give this one to the peeps.  That's a Stephen Lynch song.  About an altar boy?  Yes.  What?  What happened?  What happened now?  What?  Huh? 
[01:05:30]  What?  Nothing.  I like that.  Like what?  Nothing.  I like nothing.  Dude, you messed me up.  The big stall.  You messed me up.  If the listeners are pissed, they've got to be pissed at you today.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm the king of Stalin, but you effed him today.  All the priests as faggots.  Okay there, Frenchie.  Jeez, man.  The Frenchie say, all the priests as faggots.  There you go.  Thank you, Frenchie. 
[01:06:00]  Stephen Lynch, we'll be back.  It's written from the perspective of a priest that I knew many years ago when I was going  through some troubled times.  I went to him for some advice, some love advice, and I'm sure he helped you.  He helped me out a great deal.  Not a virgin anymore.  Great.  Jesus.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear, I kneel upon the floor.  Temptations of a Catholic priest art, easy to ignore. 
[01:06:30]  But I cannot control myself.  It rips my soul apart, for one small sheep among my flock has stoned the shepherd's heart.  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[01:07:00]  At Sunday maths or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread-eagled on the pew.  And when I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry. 
[01:07:30]  Altar boy, altar boy, is it gonna be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long, if you promise never to tell.  My father, what's enough? 
[01:08:00]  Hallowed be thy name.  I could dress him up like the Pope and then I, oh dear God, the shame.  No, no, lead us not into temptation.  Deliver us from sin  We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ  And I was Mary Magdalene  Altar boy, altar boy 
[01:08:30]  Confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God  Inside my rectory  Oh, altar boy, oh, altar boy  Confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God  Inside my rectory 
[01:09:00]  The Opie and Anthony show have been removed from the airwaves 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that was  Shouldn't have offended too many people, right?  I didn't swear  We're still stupid  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid  We don't care  We don't care  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine steak  The Opie and Anthony show 
[01:10:00]  Theater of the mindless  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show  Andrew, W.K.  Party hard  So, wait a minute, did I tell you that I went to see E.T. this weekend?  People are going to cave their radios in  What? I felt like I, you know, I would share with everyone 
[01:10:30]  Right  So, what did you think of the added scenes and, uh, I don't know  Which scenes were added? I don't even know  I guess a bathtub scene and  Right  And, uh, walkie-talkies  Yes, instead of guns on the children  Which looked completely ridiculous  Because they were holding walkie-talkies like you would hold a gun  Oh, really?  All right, speaking of, uh, partying hard 
[01:11:00]  Our pal Anthony was in the news over the break  He was?  Who?  Anthony who?  You, Ant?  Two and a half years, you're a single man  You're officially divorced  Yes  The big D  Yes  Why is Colin Quinn calling?  He's got a show on, uh, television  Yeah  He's got a show  It's been on a couple weeks now  It's very, very funny  All right, look  Look  Look  Look 
[01:11:30]  What?  I figured  What?  What are you doing?  He's on a limited time  I, I, I  I had the number  I know his shows tonight  I figured I would call up Colin and talk to him a little  Hold on, man  What?  He's very limited  For the time  So, I just want to make it perfectly clear to our fine, faithful listeners  Yeah  That Opie has nothing to do with this stall tactic today  This is not a stall  Colin is a very good friend of ours  And I, I just spur of the moment decided, hey, I want to talk to Colin Quinn  He's got a show 
[01:12:00]  Uh, uh, gonna be on tonight  And, and they're rehearsing and stuff, Opie  So, it's a live program  So, he, he's very pressed for time  We have to fit him in now  And Norton's gonna be on  Norton's gonna be on, uh, Colin Quinn again tonight?  I think, I think, uh, Norton has blown us off  He killed on Colin Quinn last week  Yeah  I think it's over  I don't think he's gonna be back with us  Well, we can't wait, uh, uh, can't make a huge NBC star wait  Hey, Colin, how you doing?  Hey, Colin  Hi, guys  Hey  Hi, guys 
[01:12:30]  How the rehearsal's going?  Um, they're going pretty good, actually  You guys aren't gonna give me the silent treatment right now, are you?  No, we don't do that  No, we won't do that  Not to you  Not to Colin Quinn  Well, again  E.T., I went to Notting Hill this weekend  It was fantastic, sensational  Notting Hill  Ha!  Sucked  Hey, uh, Colin, is it true that, uh, Brewer's gonna be on the show tonight?  Yeah, that jackass is here rehearsing  He'll be on  Oh, yeah?  I hear you guys are working on a bit together  We really are 
[01:13:00]  And, you know, he's a fine actor  A lot of people don't realize that about Jim  Academy Award winner  I think, in the future, sometime  And, uh, little Jimmy Norton's gonna be on again tonight?  Oh, little Jimmy, matter of fact, he's sitting right here with me  Ha!  Jim, ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Just two guys having fun funneling each other  Hey, Colin, did you hear that Anthony got divorced over, uh, vacation?  No, I read this whole scandalous thing  He's my hero now, because it was some big three-way  Ha! 
[01:13:30]  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Colin was reading that, too?  He's supposed to say G.D.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Yeah, ah, believe me, we're gonna read the article, uh, and it's quite saucy  Ha!  Ha!  I read it. It was really quite, it was quite enjoyable.  A little saucy.  Woof.  Who knew?  It was a little zinger.  Who knew?  Can you make reference to it on the show tonight, Colin?  Oh, I'll certainly try. I'd rather reenact it.  Isn't that why you brought in Brewer?  Yeah, Brewer's wife.  You, Norton, and Brewer. 
[01:14:00]  Three men reenacting a threesome.  Is that true, Jim? We're going to reenact?  With you, that threesome? Anthony's threesome he had once?  Once, twice. What, Harold?  Anthony's my idol for that one.  I'm not fessing up.  He's not?  No.  Yeah, I know. You had to close the case of music.  Hey, let's keep that kind of smut out of court.  You want to be saying, let's hear some details about my prowess.  Instead, we'll have a couple of incidents of the tranny when I was 19 
[01:14:30]  that I'm trying to cover up to this day.  That's what Ann said earlier.  I was like, thank God it played out like it did,  and it wasn't like, you know, oh my God,  they're going to find out about the young boys.  It's going to be in the paper.  So, Anthony, when you had three men in the bed with you,  like, how do you go back to work after that?  Right.  How did you, Colin?  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  You're very busy, aren't you?  Very Greco-Roman, I'll say that.  It's like the original Olympics.  We were actually a Greco-Roman joke today.  Nice.  So, Norton, very, very funny last week.  And look at that, he's been invited back.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Hey, what's the buzz you got, Colin?  Are they going to give you some more episodes?  Oh, who the hell knows?  Because how many were you signed for?  We were signed for three, which is the kind of vote of confidence I inspire in these people.  And now, but I did notice something which I'm going to bring up on the air about Norton, 
[01:15:30]  is that he has Kid Rock's chin.  And I don't mean that as a compliment.  Kid Rock's chin.  Yeah.  Isn't that non-existent?  Yes.  Yeah.  That's no chin.  He has a terrible chin, and he's got the same stubble growth as Kid Rock.  And the same hepatitis C.  You should have seen where to stop me.  He's trying to, like, hepatitis C AIDS jokes about Pamela Lee.  I was like, Jim, we're only on three weeks.  He doesn't care.  Look at you.  Yeah.  You've got to be the responsible one.  I know. 
[01:16:00]  It's sad when I'm the yuppie of the two.  Oh, they'll sink you in a second and then just walk away like, oh, well, it was probably  well-lasted.  You know, it's your life.  Yeah.  They'll be like, hey, it was a try, guys, right?  Yeah, right.  You're sunken, you bastard.  And Rosie O'Donnell last week, Colin?  Yeah.  She did well.  She did.  You know what?  We've said it on the show many times.  We're not big fans of Rosie, but she was cool on your show.  Right.  She seemed like one of the boys.  Well, man.  No, I mean, she was hanging, and she was dishing out some blue material.  A little blue?  A little racy?  Oh, yeah.  Not as saucy as your stuff, Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Not as saucy as some testimony?  No, we're going to really let them have it, guys.  Believe me.  I mean, I don't want to push people to watch, but you'll really have a heck of a dime.  And believe me, if you can't watch us, at least watch Just Shoot Me beforehand.  They're going to have some heavy stuff on there, so I can imagine.  Quite provocative, indeed.  When they get down and dirty on that show, I don't know what the hell to do.  Yes.  Hey, is Seinfeld going to throw you a bone tonight, Colin?  And come on?  Yeah.  No. 
[01:17:00]  No?  In Los Angeles.  You know, all right, I gave a little compliment to the program.  Yeah, but I got to tell the fine folks something, man.  Colin and Seinfeld, a big friend of Colin's.  Yeah.  He's been at the shows the last two Mondays.  You'd think he would walk out on stage and help his pal Colin.  Oh, he's been there?  Just walk past Colin as he's doing his monologue and wave.  Like, oh, look at him.  Jerry.  Yeah, Jerry, as you call him.  Jerry doesn't feel that the time is right, but Jerry says when the time is appropriate, 
[01:17:30]  he will make an appearance.  Ah.  Fascinating.  Look, it's me.  I'm walking on.  I'm doing a walk-on.  All right, where's Norton?  We've got to say hi to him.  Okay, you guys.  Thanks a lot.  He's from Norton.  All right.  Best of luck.  Yeah, Colin Quinn's show tonight on NBC.  I forgot what time.  9.30.  9.30.  One of the most innovative programs on right now.  Hello?  Jim, I've got to tell you something.  Is this Opie in my new favorite personal life?  How you doing, Norton?  Hey, hello, sir.  Hey, how are you?  I'm blessed. 
[01:18:00]  Great.  Jim, you better be funny because we were supposed to talk about Anthony's divorce during this  segment.  Yeah, I was supposed to read some saucy articles that came out.  But it seems like you have perfect timing.  You called.  Oh, well, to be honest with you, I was going to do a really funny Pam Anderson Hep C joke,  but, you know, thanks to the host for gobbling that one up for me.  A little too much over the line there.  Yeah, yeah.  I just wanted to.  Look, dude, I just wanted to call people to encourage them to watch the show tonight.  This has nothing to do with town hall April 18th. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, God.  I forgot about it over a vacation.  Why don't you just write on your forehead tonight, Jim?  Dude, if I could get away with that, believe me, I would.  Yeah.  But I'd probably put a wow sticker because it's about us, not me.  Hey, Jim.  Yeah.  How was it working with Rosie?  You know what?  No, it was funny, you were making faces when Rosie was doing her thing because you were  right in front of Rosie.  You know what?  Rosie was really nice to me.  I actually liked her because we were talking off air and she was extremely nice to me.  Yeah.  I'm such a little wormy dirtbag. 
[01:19:00]  Look at you kissing ass.  Jim, are you quitting our show now that you're hanging out with your new friends on the Colin  Quinn show?  No, not at all.  No, not at all.  Until, you know, it gets picked up.  No, you don't burn bridges before the ones are built.  I don't know how to do this.  Bird in the hand.  What's that?  Bird in the hand.  What material are you doing today?  Are you going to do some of that E.T. material?  No.  First of all, you went and saw E.T., I know. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  And that was a perfect setup, by the way.  Yeah.  I have no desire to see it unless there's a different ending.  And instead of going home, he's drowned in a bathtub in Houston.  That's my only E.T. joke.  Right.  And that's why we won't get through the censors.  Pam Anderson joke was good.  What was that?  It won't be funny now because we've already discussed it, but Pam Anderson wants to date  a bad boy like Tommy Lee and she gets Hep C.  That's what you get.  You could have went with a guy like me and had AIDS. 
[01:20:00]  There's no way that's getting through the network censors.  Of course not.  That's funny, though.  Colin just said, unless I can prove I had AIDS.  You could have 30 girls you could talk to have lost 40 pounds.  It's based on some kind of fact.  I'm trying to show a different side of myself.  I don't want to just do AIDS jokes.  Right.  I apologize.  That's why you're bringing the Hep C joke in.  That's nice.  You've got to be married.  Multi-faceted diseases.  Very good.  Norton, I'm catching up on the email because we were on break and a lot of people just rave  reviews for your appearance on Colin last week. 
[01:20:30]  Yep.  It was.  It's great to be able to be honest, to be able to do a tip and to the general on television,  man, because any other network show would never allow you to even touch on terrorism  or anything like that.  And the only thing they're basically doing on Colin's show.  Wait a minute.  Look at you.  Back to your clever self.  Well, just don't say the C word is their line.  They have given so much freedom, which is materialized in everybody.  As much as I don't like Keith and Patrice personally, the stuff they have is absolutely hilarious. 
[01:21:00]  And Joey Vega and Greg Gerardo, it's a great show.  Patrice doing the white guy thing the other night was hilarious.  It really was.  And I wanted to look at him because he's not a good person.  Hey, so Brewer?  Brewer's helping you guys out tonight.  Yeah, they're working on a sketch.  It's probably going to be on.  The problem is with time.  I know that there was time constraints last week, and that's a problem that they have this  week, too.  Just hard with live TV.  So you never know exactly what's going to happen on it because of the time. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, I'm hoping to see a closing credit this week.  That would be nice.  What happened last week?  I think something just ran long.  And again, with live TV, you know, the TV people are not exactly very caring about artistic  value.  It's like, all right, it's over.  Talk, talk.  Right.  But Colin didn't care.  Why do you need goodbye?  I mean, you know, you saw the sketches.  Everything funny had been done.  Why do you want to watch him waving?  You've seen enough of him.  The show just ends.  That's the way it works.  He gives you brilliantly funny material, and that's it.  Go. 
[01:22:00]  Jim, do you have anything on Ant's divorce?  Because that's what we're supposed to talk about here.  No, I have nothing on it.  I wouldn't even have thought of writing a joke about Ant's divorce unless you guys brought  it up.  I'm not that comfortable in studio yet.  He'll have to be in here, I think.  That's all I can picture is mentioning.  So how about that divorce article and having Ant look at me and really, well, I'm glad I  have a mailing list.  All right, guys.  Have a good show, man.  For those of you who watched, oh, Colin wants to say one more thing.  Yes.  I don't really plug my own TV appearances, because, you know, who cares? 
[01:22:30]  But this one I just watched, because, you know, it's a support college show, man.  This is like the one edgy guy on television.  Everything else is such fluff and garbage.  At least we can make fun of Terry.  Yeah, I think we should all check it out tonight.  9.30 on NBC.  Let me put Sweetie back on the phone.  I'll see you guys in a while.  Sweetie.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Just the reason Anthony is a hero is not because he got two girls to do a freeway.  Anyone can do that.  It's that he got two girls to do a freeway while he was an air-conditioned repairman.  Did that come out? 
[01:23:00]  Is that in the article, too?  Yes.  It is?  Yes.  Wow.  I missed that part.  It's coming on.  Very good.  You know how it is.  Colin, there's your opening joke.  Great.  I'll see you guys later.  Thanks.  All right, Colin.  Thanks.  Colin Quinn tonight, 9.30 on NBC.  Yeah, support the show because the last thing I want to see is Colin walking back into another  OTB with his hot tips.  You know what I mean?  It's kind of, you know, when we first saw Colin a while back on the streets.  Yeah, we've seen him come full circle, yes. 
[01:23:30]  I'm like, here's Colin Quinn, this guy SNL.  You know, I remember him from Remote Control.  He had a funny comic.  He had a great run on SNL.  Next thing you know, he's running out of the Brooklyn Diner.  Say hi to us.  Open ending.  How you guys doing?  Look, I got to get to OTB.  I got a great tip.  Oh, this thing's a winner, man.  Go down, do it now.  Don't tell no one.  You push the odds down.  And then that Irish bar we did lunch at one day.  Yeah.  He happened to be in there.  He comes running back in to tell us the tip, and he's like, that's a great tip.  I only get the best tips.  You know, I would never tell anybody unless it was a good tip. 
[01:24:00]  Just don't tell anyone else.  Push the odds down.  I got to make a buck.  All right.  Jock shocks in court.  Oh, we have to take a break now.  Oh, Jesus.  It's not my fault.  Holy God.  It's not my fault.  Look, you know something?  You're running out of phone calls, dude.  At first, I was seeing people emailing and calling, and it was all good, clean, let's goof on Opie and Anthony, because they're stretching this out kind of fun. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  Now, I am seeing genuine hatred of us for doing this.  We're going to blow off Colin?  No.  We didn't know he was calling there.  Come on.  It's not like we, you know, plan this stuff.  Be patient, people.  It's not like we have a schedule in front of us.  No.  5-20, talk about aunt's divorce.  I mean, yes.  Actually, you know what?  We would do it right now, but look, Ben's freaking out.  Ben, what's wrong?  I know.  Ben. 
[01:25:00]  Ben, what's wrong?  We're late with commercials?  Commercial.  Well, he's saying, yeah, and he means it.  Commercials.  Oh, you know what?  Seriously, though, I wanted to finish up the Jim Norton thing.  I wanted to play.  It's like, what, a minute?  Yeah.  This was part of what Jim had to say on the Colin Quinn show.  We're pretty proud of him last Monday night, and he's on tonight with Brewer and a bunch  of the guys you know and love from this show.  A lot of them are on our show.  Okay, here it is.  Jim Norton from the Colin Quinn show.  Without forcing diversity, this next guy would be alone forever. 
[01:25:30]  Jim.  First of all, I'm starting to feel really guilty for mooing at her and her friend.  Here's the problem I have with diversity.  In theory, it's good.  In practice, it sucks because it affects things like humor.  All in the Family, brilliant show.  You could never do that again today because the language wouldn't be accepted.  Archie would get mad at Meathead.  He'd call him a Polack.  If you said that now, the next morning you'd have 10,000 Polish people outside protesting 
[01:26:00]  in front of the wrong network.  And people really tend to allow you to address issues in films that you cannot address in humor.  If you make a film about retarded people, it's acceptable if you address it in humor.  You're very insensitive.  People will come up to you.  Don't make fun of retarded people.  That's sick.  Meanwhile, Tom Hanks runs around for two and a half hours.  I love you, Jenny.  That is a genius. 
[01:26:30]  Why does every actor have to play a retarded guy?  Tom Hanks did it.  Sean Penn did it.  Juliette Lewis did it.  Keanu Reeves does it accidentally in every film.  Are you ready?  Opie and Anthony are going to touch your words dirty.  Take a look at Pam, okay?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phones off the hook today, Anthony. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, they seem to want to talk.  First day back from vacation.  Ah.  Chris, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey, Chris.  You guys are friggin' ridiculous.  You're going on two hours of bitch's all time here.  Huh?  What?  You started talking about it at 315.  It's almost 515 now.  You said 520.  Opie, why don't you just cut to another 12-minute commercial break?  Huh?  Ridiculous.  I have it down.  428, 440, 12-minute commercial break.  Do actual 15 minutes of radio with Colin Quinn. 
[01:27:30]  455, you start another 12-minute commercial break.  It's ridiculous.  Not 12 minutes, no.  13?  Wow.  No, I think about 8 that time around.  No way.  All right, Chris.  I'm never subscribing to Hotline or Hotwire.  I'm never buying a Kia, and I'm even going to give up Bud Light now.  Thanks very much.  All right, Chris.  Bye-bye.  I think we've given them two hours of hilarity today.  Yuri, what's going on?  You know how much I hate you guys?  What?  I'm listening to you guys since 3 o'clock.  I get out to get an effing haircut. 
[01:28:00]  I come back, and you still haven't talked about it.  Thank God, right?  That's why we did it, Yuri.  Yuri, if your haircut took a little less time, we would have been able to get to the story.  Yeah.  We waited for you, Yuri.  I hope you had a good haircut.  It was all right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Thank you.  Len, what's going on?  Len.  Hey, Tools.  I got a new character for the show for you.  Okay, ready?  Anthony.  Here we go.  How was your weekend, buddy? 
[01:28:30]  How's your game of Loser Quest going?  Oh, good.  Have you figured out which guy I am?  I'm staying for more time so Anthony doesn't have to get embarrassed, guys.  All right.  We'll get to it.  Hurry up.  But if I said we get to it right now, you're not going to believe me.  But we're going to get to it right this second.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I hear the Berlin Wall came down before you guys are going to play this show.  All right, Doug.  Come on.  Don't worry about it.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Opie and Will Chamberlain?  What's up, guys?  Oh, God. 
[01:29:00]  The only thing that's taking longer to get to than this story is Anthony's two-and-a-half-year divorce.  All right, Chris.  You know, the previous caller brought up a good point, Opie.  Yeah.  I did spend a lot of time playing EverQuest.  No, no, no, no.  And I just want to say...  No, no, no.  We're not going there.  Cats in Hats Guild has been helping me out with my...  My epic weapon quest, Opie.  No, no, no, no.  Zombo.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  And I'd love to talk about that for another hour and 50 minutes, if I may. 
[01:29:30]  Well, I wouldn't mind for 10 minutes.  Zombo.  Yo, you two effing dickweeds.  You're killing me, man.  What?  You're killing me.  I'm in that contractor's, like, atmospheric dilemma, you know, and the radio station comes  in crystal clear in the car.  Yeah.  Well, you can't get it on in the house.  All right.  Two-and-a-half hours almost, man.  I got three pieces of molding left to do.  Get on with it.  Boy, Ann, you better have a good story to tell.  Why?  I'm not even reading it.  You are.  Pete, what's going on?  Opie, stand strong.  You only got another nine minutes to go. 
[01:30:00]  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Quick question.  Yeah.  Is there any truth to the room where the other girl's name was Allison?  Shut up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ouch.  Everyone's funny.  It's not that important to get to 520, by the way.  No.  Anytime after five, it's fine.  No.  With the good stuff.  Hmm.  Oh, look at Joe.  Uh, Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:30:30]  Hey.  I just want to say thank you, because I got out of work at, like, 430, and I still haven't  missed the beginning of the show yet.  We gave you guys some funny stuff.  Would you stop?  Jock Shocks in court, Opie.  Okay.  And Radio Raunch Man.  Which one do we go to first?  I don't know.  Do you want Jock Shocks in court or Radio Raunch Man in R-rated Divorce? 
[01:31:00]  How ridiculous is this?  I should, um, I should do a little preface.  Go ahead.  I'm just trying to figure out, uh, which is the better story, because you should save  the better story for last.  There was one in the Daily News.  And one in the Post.  And one in the New York Post.  Last, uh, Wednesday, I think, came out.  I think I will read the, uh, Post second.  Right?  And, um, someone pointed out to me that, hey, there's a Post reporter in the courtroom. 
[01:31:30]  I'm like, all right.  You know, because, um, I'm pretty much just answering standard ridiculous.  You know what I mean?  Standard divorce, uh, questions.  Right.  Things like that.  You were supposed to be on trial for, uh, the whole time we were on vacation.  Yeah, yeah.  It was supposed to last that long.  So when I read these articles, uh, in Killington in between skiing on Tuesday morning, I was  quite surprised.  Well, this thing had gone on for, you know, two and a half years. 
[01:32:00]  Two and a half years.  So they finally, uh, you know, with the court system the way it is, which is ridiculous.  If I, for a second, my actual freedom of, of life, as far as being, uh, having to go to  prison or something, is in the hands of the court, oh, you are screwed.  Like, I am, I am so glad, uh, you know, I'm not committing any real crime.  Crimes on morality, apparently.  But, uh, I'm not really committing any crime.  Two girls for every boy. 
[01:32:30]  But, yeah, it just went on and it was supposed to be all, all week during the vacation.  That was going to be my vacation.  Getting this done with.  So day one is, uh, you know, me.  I get up there and, uh, I'm being asked questions.  It's, uh, all in the paper here.  Uh, my wife's lawyer, the, uh, inimitable.  And, I gotta correct you, you're an ex-wife at this point. 
[01:33:00]  My ex-wife's lawyer.  Uh, the personality-filled Dominic Barbara.  Group.  Sex.  Group.  Sex.  Group.  Sex.  All right, sorry.  Shut up.  Uh, yes, Dominic Barbara.  You may, uh, know him from, uh, such, uh, shows as The Howard Stern Show. 
[01:33:30]  And, of course, his, uh, court TV show that no one watched.  Obviously.  And, uh, yeah.  And, um, yeah.  You know, when I found that out, I'm just like, oh.  You know, and she, uh, or it got him as a lawyer.  I'm just like, oh, boy.  This is, this isn't gonna be fun.  Well, he's asking me the standard, you know, issue questions. 
[01:34:00]  There's a couple of, uh, reporters now in the courtroom.  And, uh, all of a sudden, questions start being asked about, about very personal matters, Opie.  Very personal matters.  Of, uh, things that, um, allegedly, uh, took place.  No.  Sex.  No.  Sex.  Does group not imply more than three? 
[01:34:30]  More than two.  More than two.  No, I, I would always assume group would be four.  All right.  Then I, I got, we could do this one then.  I would.  Two girls for every boy.  So there was a reporter in the, uh, there were a few reporters.  I only knew there was one, but, uh, there seemed to have been two.  Are there more articles coming out, eh?  I don't know.  What the hell, uh, you know.  People want to know if there will be more articles coming out.  I, I would say probably not.  Probably not.  I don't think it's all that thrilling. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah?  Well.  Whatever.  All right.  So, um, so which one are you going to read first?  The Daily News?  The Daily News.  From the five pages of the Daily News.  This, uh, the Daily News had a nice picture of, uh, me walking out of the courtroom or the  courthouse in Manhattan.  And, uh, as I said before, if you, you want to get a little image of what the courthouse  looks like, yeah, if you, you've seen The Godfather, the movie, at the end when Michael  Corleone is taking care of business during the, uh, baptism of his, uh, godchild, and 
[01:35:30]  the one, uh, one ahead of the five families gets shot at the top of the big, long courthouse  steps by the guy that's dressed like a cop, that's the courtroom.  Where the dead guy was falling down the stairs, that's where, uh, we were walking down and  having that picture taken that ended up in the Daily News.  With the paparazzi in front of you.  Yeah.  We walk out.  The pops are going off.  They're, they're taking pictures, and I'm looking behind me for who they're taking pictures  of.  That's how big a tool I am.  I have no clue that for some reason they're taking pictures, uh, of me. 
[01:36:00]  Well, this is a big story.  And the X.  All right.  So, uh, Daily News.  From last, uh, Tuesday.  Hold on to your hats, but lock the kids in the bedroom and duct tape them in.  This is a little saucy.  A little saucy.  A little saucy.  I just like the look you had in the picture.  Wearing your NBC jacket.  Well, no.  It, making the fine people of CBS very happy.  Well, see, it, but you got that, you got that jacket for free when we were doing the 
[01:36:30]  XFL thing, which was an NBC thing.  All right.  Let me, I'm looking at the picture right now.  CBS should maybe, uh, send you some free coats that you can wear.  See, look, there's my nice sweater, and I'm blocking the NBC logo.  On purpose.  If you noticed, I folded my, I put my hands in my jacket pocket and kind of pulled it open.  It looks like I want to show off my fine, uh, sweater.  But no, I, I am.  You can see part of your peacock. 
[01:37:00]  Shut up.  You mean the NBC peacock logo?  Yes.  Yes, of course you do.  A little bit.  And, um, it is pretty funny.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  So, I'm going to read this, and, uh, because I don't know what you really want to do, and  you can just hit your bell when you want to comment.  How's that?  Well, what comment would I, and you'll stop?  Yeah, I'll stop.  What if I have, what if I can't say anything, yet I would, I would have liked to have commented.  Ooh. 
[01:37:30]  All there are things you can't comment about.  No, like, I'll pause when I think you want to comment, and if you can't comment, then I'll  take that as, we better move along.  Well, put it this way.  Anything that's in the paper can be commented on.  Because there are, you know, people here on the air, and other people, who seem to be  a bit confused as to, uh, what, uh, personal matters are fair for public consumption. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  This is in the paper.  You know?  Okay.  Tear it up.  Tear it up.  Have fun with it.  Okay.  But, uh, there are certain things I didn't and would not comment on.  There are certain things that aren't printed that, um, would not be commented on.  All right.  That's fair enough.  For whether legal matters or, uh, you know, other things, mostly legalities and things  I have, uh, said that I cannot, I've been told, uh, I cannot talk about. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  But that's all.  You sound like a lawyer.  No, I never want to sound like a lawyer.  Just put in a, uh, a CD sound effect of, uh, of snakes.  That's lawyers.  Pfft.  Oh, my God.  Ben, we have to take a, no.  Just kidding.  Oh, my God.  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That was a little joke.  You just annoyed a lot of people.  All right.  So, uh, daily news from last Tuesday, uh, headline.  Jock shocks in court.  Jock shocks in court.  I'll be playing off the shock jock. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  Thing.  Because we're shock jocks.  Of course we are.  But I shocked the court.  Uh.  Opie and Anthony's shock jock, Anthony Cumia.  Yeah.  Reached a deal in his divorce from his wife, Jennifer, after a Manhattan Supreme Court hearing yesterday  that was almost as kinky as one of his shows.  Wow.  Two girls for every boy.  You are a dick.  What? 
[01:39:30]  Are we stopping?  No, no.  We have to.  All right.  I have to take this.  Right, Don Corleone?  I can't believe it.  Don.  Don Corleone, it was in the paper.  It was in the paper.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I don't know.  Don Corleone, what should I do?  What should I do?  You can act like a man.  What should I do?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I think you were acting like a man.  You can act like a man. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  I was like Sonny.  I was like Sonny Corleone.  In cross-examination by Jennifer's lawyer, Dominic Bargrave.  Ah.  Ugh.  Cumia admitted he and his wife had engaged in a frisky...  Frisky?  Hey, don't comment unless you're hitting the bell.  Go ahead.  Frisky!  Thank you.  He admitted that he and his wife had engaged in a frisky menage a trois.  A frisky Sidney Poitier. 
[01:40:30]  During their 11-year marriage.  11?  Really?  Hello?  Hello, Dominic Barbra?  Yeah, it's me.  Hey, how are you, Dom?  You publicity whore.  What's the matter, Dominic?  I want to just tell you and all your listeners...  Yeah.  Oop, wait a minute.  Let me put this on.  I want to tell you and all your listeners that you were a gentleman.  Ah!  That you settled this case in a reasonable way. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  And that you may be angry at me because I was doing my job.  But I walked away from the show...  By getting reporters in the courtroom.  Yeah, that's a great job.  No, I didn't bring the...  Have you been introduced to Opie, Dominic?  No, I haven't.  This is Opie, my partner.  Also worth $100 million.  Yeah, that's doing your job.  Actually, Opie came up a little more than $100.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  He came up $130.  $130 million, Opie. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Present, future value.  Yeah, that's right.  Come on, Joe.  But I just want...  I'm serious about this.  Hey, Dominic, your boyfriend, Howard, is not going to be pissed that you're on this show,  is he?  Yes, no.  Only this girl.  But I do want to say to you, and I mean, let's hear it, Anthony.  Okay.  You were a gentleman.  Yeah, I tried.  Settle the case like a gentleman.  And you may be angry at me, but someday maybe you'll be my friend.  Your friend?  Hey, Dominic.  How bad do you need that publicity, Dominic?  I don't need it at all.  Can I ask you a question, though, Dominic? 
[01:42:00]  Sure.  During that point where the reporters were in the courtroom...  I didn't know they were there yet, right?  You absolutely didn't know.  No, no, no.  I had no idea.  You're such a liar.  And why would such provocative line of questioning come up at that early juncture?  Because my goal was to get you to sit down and go close this case.  That's all my goal was.  You could have done that two and a half years ago.  Well, no.  Thank you, honey.  We can't go into the terms.  But I will say this again.  Okay, fatso.  That's a French move. 
[01:42:30]  That's Frenchy, Dominic.  I just want to say it again before you guys get too out of hand.  Anthony, you were a gentleman.  Thank you, Dominic Barbara.  Goodbye.  My adversary in the court.  There he goes.  Can you believe he calls?  Yeah, I can.  He's a publicity hound.  Love seeing his name in the paper.  Love hearing his name on the radio.  Oh, boy.  Love being on the radio.  He's a fatso.  All right there, Frenchy. 
[01:43:00]  Nothing more degrading than being bitched out by a Frenchman.  Nothing more emasculating.  He's a fat snake.  Than having a Frenchman drill you.  Ugh.  Jock Shocks in court.  He's listening today, obviously.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Drop dead of a heart attack.  Ooh, dropping.  Can't wait to read that in the paper.  It'll happen.  Oh, that seems a bit harsh. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, boy.  Getting the coffin.  Oh, what?  Do you want to comment?  What?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, Harpo.  What?  I was just, you know, stating one of my wishes.  What? 
[01:44:00]  What's wrong?  Are you commenting?  By not commenting?  You want to be left out of this?  Okay.  I can see right through him.  He ain't fooling me.  Come on.  I was a gentleman.  Congrats, Dominic.  You finally got on our show.  How cute. 
[01:44:30]  Anyway, where were we in the article, Ant?  Did we talk about the...  I think we were at Frisky.  Oh, Frisky.  Okay.  In cross-examination by Jennifer's lawyer, the fat, bloated mess that was just on our show,  Kumi admitted he and his wife...  Wait a minute.  Let me see if I can read that.  What?  My article isn't complete because I didn't read the part you just read.  Oh, no.  It says right here.  Look.  Oh, okay.  This is an updated article. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  All right.  Right off the AP.  Look.  It says it right there.  Yeah.  Kumi admitted he and his wife had engaged in a frisky menage a trois during their 11-year  marriage.  No.  Because now I'm really pissed.  If you don't see right through that...  All right!  All right!  You're out of it.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  What are you doing now? 
[01:45:30]  Can I read this at...  Are you commenting or...  Are you going to say anything?  No.  You could read away.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  This is Dominic.  Was there another woman you were seeing at that time?  Asked Barbara.  Shut up!  Yes, replied the WNAW talkmeister.  Quiet.  Was she one of the thirdsome in bed?  Asked the lawyer. 
[01:46:00]  You're not commenting about any of this?  Yes, said Kumya.  When Barbara asked if he had left Jennifer for another woman, Kumya replied, it was more  complicated than that.  I did?  Where did I say that?  Let me see.  Forget your workbook.  Comment?  More...  It was more complicated than that.  Right.  Opie, the only comment I could have is to say... 
[01:46:30]  Well, you didn't hit your bell.  Yes.  Is to say, I believe it was more complicated than that.  That's my comment.  I'm not changing it.  Quiet.  All right.  Shortly after...  Quiet.  Shortly after the grilling...  Grilling.  Anthony, Jennifer, and their lawyers went behind closed doors and emerged two hours later  announcing they had a settlement.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  It took a little meeting and you had a settlement?  That's what I read in the paper.  After two and a half years, it took a little meeting for a settlement?  It seems that's...  That seems to be what had happened, Opie.  It seems there was a settlement.  A settlement.  A settlement.  My...  What?  See, my take on this whole thing, without releasing any of the details of said settlement,  is that I felt it was going to go on longer than I would have liked. 
[01:47:30]  It had already taken up a lot of my life and time.  And I thought it was a good time to get out.  And, you know, it was kind of a mutual outlook on the whole thing, too.  Because I think other people involved were like, hey, you know, it's kind of, you know,  it's been going on long enough.  All right.  So we went into the room.  Yes. 
[01:48:00]  And details of that are, as it says here, Opie, confidential.  Confidential.  Confidential.  Do I see that?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So let me back up.  It was more complicated.  Okay.  Shortly after the grilling, Anthony, Jennifer, and their lawyers went behind closed doors  and emerged two hours later announcing they had group sex.  No!  That is not in the paper.  What did you read?  It's the updated copies.  Let me see.  No, it's right there.  No, it says went behind closed doors and emerged two hours later announcing they had a settlement. 
[01:48:30]  But it says AP, group sex.  No.  See, it's penciled in with marker.  No.  It's not even typed.  No, that's...  The words are scratched out.  No.  And the word group sex is written in marker in Rick's handwriting.  No, that's group sex.  I...  No.  Okay.  How many times AP is written next to it?  Details remain confidential.  But Barber told the news that... 
[01:49:00]  So what was that?  Uh, the details remain confidential, but Barber told the news...  The daily news.  What?  Uh, Barber.  That's...  That's your ex-wife's lawyer.  That's your ex-wife's lawyer.  Okay.  What did he say?  Sorry, I had a big lunch.  Uh, details remain confidential, but Barber told the daily news...  You saw how happy she was.  She went skipping out of here.  That's exactly what he said.  That's the quote in the, uh, paper. 
[01:49:30]  Anthony had no comment.  We walked out together at the same time.  There was no skipping.  There was no skipping.  I would have seen skipping.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Last year, Greg Opie Hughes and Anthony Cumia reportedly signed a $30 three-year syndication deal. 
[01:50:00]  30 bucks!  Spread over three years, my friend.  Right.  And while Cumia denied knowing how much he was worth, Barber said there was a report putting the value of his celebrity status at $100 million.  $100 million?  And I just learned I'm worth $130 million.  You're worth $130.  Why is that?  I don't know.  You're a little...  I think because you have been in this business...  Because my name's first.  ...and your expertise in the business.  But we're equal partners in this. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  Jennifer Cumia filed for divorce in 1999.  She and Cumia met in 1987 while he was working for a Long Island air conditioning and heating company.  Give him a plug.  It's Apollo Air Conditioning in Bayshore.  And she was tending bar nearby.  The article ends with probably my favorite statement of the whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  This is...  This is great.  You can hit your bell.  They married on May 19, 1990.  A date Anthony Cumia could not recall in court. 
[01:51:00]  Look!  There are a lot of dates in my head.  I was thinking about it.  Did it make you happy that he called you a gentleman?  No, I really don't care, to tell you the truth.  I absolutely don't care. 
[01:51:30]  It is...  I'm very happy that this is over.  All right.  You're a better man than me.  Tom, what's going on?  Why's that?  Hey, boy.  I wouldn't be able to sit here and listen to him.  That's just me, though.  I don't know what's going through your head.  You know something?  And what am I going to do?  What would you have done?  I know you, though.  You're a freaking psychopath.  That was actually very nice.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Yes.  Because I wasn't sure if things were signed. 
[01:52:00]  Hold on.  I got to explain.  I was very nice there, because I'm not sure if everything is signed.  It's the only thing.  You know something?  I don't think there's anything you could have told him.  You know, you could have called him whatever the hell you want.  And he doesn't already know himself.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Just did some research.  You two are worth more than the entire economy of Haiti.  Yeah.  Yeah, Haiti.  Then where do we start shopping?  Ed.  Yeah.  You remember the date of the menage? 
[01:52:30]  Look, I didn't remember the wedding date, because I was mulling it in my head.  The reporters are sitting there, right?  They're looking for a goddamn angle.  And he asked me the date, and I'm thinking, hmm, is it March or May?  Well, why don't you tell the listeners why you were confused?  Well, March 19th is Swallows Day in San Juan Capistrano, which was very, it's where the  Swallows come back to Capistrano, right? 
[01:53:00]  You know that every year they come back?  And being a former resident of San Juan Capistrano growing up, it was always a pretty big date,  because there'd be a big parade, and the town would get together.  Are we talking about birds?  What?  We're talking about birds.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  I don't know.  Oh, yes, they would come back to Capistrano.  So, the March-May thing, I may have delayed my answer for a moment or two until, you know, 
[01:53:30]  it's like, well, it was May 19th.  And then it looks like I didn't remember.  I was right on the tip of my tongue.  I was just ready to blurt it out.  That's how the Daily News article ends.  I'm going to get into the post here in a second.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, I mentioned everyone else in that show.  You guys will drag on it, so.  All right, man. 
[01:54:00]  Ike, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  Ant, I think you finally just got even with Opie for the Time article.  You mean the one where my only quote is about how the Ashley, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are hot?  Yeah.  That should have been in the threesome, the two Olsen twins.  Yeah, two other girls in Anthony's life.  The Olsen twins.  All right, Ike.  Thank you.  All right, so let's read the post.  Very, very funny. 
[01:54:30]  The post, for some reason, used an old picture of here in the studio.  Yes.  And underneath the picture, Olsen, what does it say?  Tales of three-way sex.  Tales of three-way sex.  Oh, my God.  Tony, what's going on? 
[01:55:00]  Hey, you know, I'm not a big legal buff.  I'm pretty sure if the ex-girlfriend's lawyer calls up and calls you a gentleman, that's never a good sign.  I think we don't really need to know how confidential it was.  All right.  All right, bye, guys.  Bye.  It is a gentleman, though.  It's a nice guy.  Well, I try.  Thank you, Opie.  I try. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  I try to go through life as a nice guy.  A nice boy.  See?  Is your mom proud?  I turned my phones off on...  Do they have any idea?  On Thursday.  Now, I was in court on Tuesday.  Yeah.  The story came out in the papers on Wednesday.  Yeah.  My phone was off until, I believe, Friday.  Now, I called up my mom.  She's cool.  She's a very liberated woman.  You know, what the hell is she going to say?  She goes, well, you know, you're an adult. 
[01:56:00]  Did she give you permission to play that bit?  No.  She's not that liberated in her thinking.  That's a good trade-off, though.  Please.  What kind of trade-off is that?  Give her 10 mil.  You're feeling a little uncomfortable, so maybe your mom can feel a little uncomfortable  and let us play that bit again.  I don't feel uncomfortable.  I think it's a little uncomfortable.  It's expected of us on this goddamn show.  Hell, you're a hero, but I feel a little uncomfortable.  Well, you know something?  The only uncomfortable thing I got was, because I know the neighborhood my mom lives in, 
[01:56:30]  you know, they're probably looking like, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  There's the mother of that, you know, that pervert.  Yeah.  That's sexual.  Yeah.  Sex.  Shut up.  What?  Groot.  Groot.  Yeah, that one's better. 
[01:57:00]  Emory agrees with something you said.  Emory.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Nothing.  I just wanted to call my Anthony, though, that I sympathize with your situation, and I want  to let you know that I agree with you.  It's not a group sex until you've had foursome.  Right.  Exactly.  It's a menage a trois, which I have experienced.  It's very fun.  And then I invited two other women into my husband and myself's bedroom, and I would consider  that group sex.  Three menage a trois, four group sex.  Absolutely.  I totally agree. 
[01:57:30]  I've had both, and I would have to go with you with the group.  All right.  Four or more is group.  Thank you, Emory.  Hey, have a great night.  All right, bye.  But it's like I was saying earlier, how do you come into work if there was, like, guys  involved?  Ugh!  Fuggets.  That's right, Frenchie.  Touche.  Ugh!  All right, can we go to the FU line?  We do have to take a break here.  We gave you guys 40 minutes.  Don't yell anymore, please.  Stop yelling.  Did you read the second one we'll read when we get back? 
[01:58:00]  That's where I have sheepish replies.  Yeah, the word sheepish.  You know, I don't like the way they describe my responses.  In one, I'm snapping.  In one, I'm sheepish.  We're snapping.  In my answer.  Where we're snapping?  I'm snapping above sheepish.  Sheepish snapping.  Yeah, there you go.  Snapped.  You snapped in court.  I snapped.  I didn't snap.  All right.  We'll go to the FU line, and we'll continue in just a bit.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opin' Anthony FU line.  Hey, this is Derek from Massachusetts. 
[01:58:30]  I like to send a big, sloppy FU to all the dumb-ass traffic on the Mass Pike every f***ing day I come home.  It's the goddamn sun.  Why do you have to f***ing break at the f***ing sun?  The sun isn't coming at you.  Stop f***ing stomping for no f***ing reason.  Use the f***ing gas pedal.  Stop stomping.  Just stop.  Stop.  Next message. 
[01:59:00]  This is a big f*** you to the guy who hit and killed my dog and never stopped.  I hope while you were running away like a little coward, you ran a red light and a truck slammed into you,  knocking you into a ditch, and leaving you there to die.  What an a***** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'm a personal trainer, and I want to say FU to all my fat clients who are hell-bent on wasting my time  and then eating the goddamn malamars before I walk in on them in their house. 
[01:59:30]  FU to you fat, spoiled brat.  Next message.  Yeah, this is FU to Con Quinn for never hunting down Julie Brown.  Probably work for MTV and punching her in her stupid, fat face.  Wubba wubba.  End of message.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  Oh, yeah.  Big story.  After two and a half years, Anthony is a free man.  He's divorced.  Right.  Happened over vacation.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Kind of the reason why we went on vacation, if you think about it.  Well, actually, I would have rather spent vacation somewhere else.  True, but...  And that was court dates?  It was over, like, day one.  Day one, a couple hours into it, instead of a week or so?  Yeah, two weeks.  It's going to be a two-week trial.  All with everybody.  It was going to be fun.  A regular old party.  It's going to be happening over there on Center Street.  All right, so we are finally to the second article, the New York Post article. 
[02:00:30]  From March 20th, 2002, Anthony.  Right off the AP.  AP.  The headline reads, Radio Raunch Man in R-Rated Divorce.  R-Rated.  That would be you, my friend.  I couldn't even get, like, X-Rated Divorce.  You know?  Like, why is it Radio Raunch Man in R-Rated Divorce?  Like, the headline is, like, ooh, X-Rated.  Oh, I've got to read it.  I have a feeling if you went five more minutes on the witness stand, it was good. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Hoping for triple X.  Jesus.  All right, so I'm going to read this in, and when you want to comment, you hit your little  bell over there, okay?  Uh-huh.  And if you want to comment, but you can't, that's when you ding, ding, ding, ding.  Right.  Ding, ding, ding.  Exactly.  Do a little rush thing for us there.  Okay.  Uh, and you thought his radio show was raunchy.  Ho, ho!  You thought!  Uh, Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony fame is free to go effing crazy. 
[02:01:30]  He's...  Wait a minute.  What?  That isn't in the article I have.  No, this is the updated version right here.  No, again, it's magic marker that is in Rick's handwriting.  No, this is...  No, look.  Look, I'm holding it up.  Look, there's the picture of you from a long time ago.  It says nothing about free to go effing crazy.  Can I read this?  Well, read the real article.  And you're supposed to hit the bell when, uh, you want to comment.  Thank you.  Read the real article.  All right. 
[02:02:00]  Uh, Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony fame is free to go effing crazy.  He settled his divorce case, but not before talking about all the effing he was doing  on the witness stand.  It doesn't say that.  Uh, did you bring other women into your bed?  Jennifer's lawyer, Fat Dominic, asked the surprise schlong jock.  It says shock jock and half of that what you said doesn't...  Read the goddamn article.  And your answer, uh, yeah, so what's your point, you eff...  Ooh. 
[02:02:30]  What?  All right, I got to use a couple, uh, a couple letters.  I'm surprised they're, uh, they can print this in the post, but we can't read it, uh,  word for word on the air.  Yeah, so what's your point, you fat ass?  I didn't say that.  It's not in the paper.  The WNEW personality.  Snapped.  Snapped.  That is, uh, not the way the article went. 
[02:03:00]  Wasn't there another woman you were seeing?  The snake-like lawyer asked.  That is...  What?  That isn't what's...  You are reading something Rick wrote.  Yeah, of course.  Your reply, Anthony?  Yeah, why are you jealous?  I can get laid, fat boy.  That isn't what was in the paper.  You replied, Kumia, sheepishly.  Sheepishly.  Sheepishly.  My sheepish response. 
[02:03:30]  Would you...  Was she one of the, uh, thirdsome in bed?  The sweaty lawman asked.  Sweaty lawman.  I don't see that.  You replied, uh, with this, Anthony?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I lost count, you mother-effing, fat-ass eater.  I don't think that's the article. 
[02:04:00]  It's not the one I have right here.  Everything you've said has not been in the paper.  Some type of farcical article that you have that was written by, uh, Rick.  Very funny, Rick.  All right.  I'll try this one.  Okay. 
[02:04:30]  Okay.  Oh, Lady Di checking in.  Hey, ONA.  Welcome back to the studio.  How was vacation, Anthony?  Other than the court date, how was the rest of your vacation?  How does it feel to be free?  I know that I love it.  I would call, but I have a cold.  We'll see you soon, Lady Di.  Ugh.  Uncle John wants to say something.  Uncle John? 
[02:05:00]  Uncle John.  Hello?  Oh, hi.  Hey.  I have an imitation of Anthony, uh, free to go crazy now.  Why?  Bang, bang, bang.  I'm going crazy.  Bang, bang, bang.  I'm crazy.  Bang, bang.  That's the Friday crazy bang, bang.  Uh, Gooch.  Gooch.  What's up, Gooch?  How you doing?  All right.  Just was curious if, uh, Anthony Barney Chance knew when, uh, Columbus discovered America.  I think that was...  14, May. 
[02:05:30]  Hmm.  I don't remember.  March 19th?  March...  Is it March?  May.  May.  No?  What?  I don't remember.  All right, let's get through this here.  All right, so Radio Raunchman and R-Rated Divorce, uh, and he thought his radio show was raunchy.  Ho-ho.  Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony fame settled his divorce case against estranged, uh, wife  Jennifer yesterday, but not before talking about riding the three-way of love on the  witness stand.  What is that?  Now, my friend, that is tight.  It's off the AP, no magic marker. 
[02:06:00]  The three-way of love on the witness stand.  It almost makes it sound like it happened on the witness stand.  But not before talking about riding the three-way of love on the witness stand.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  The caravan of love.  The three-way of love.  Oh, Jesus.  Freaking reporters.  Did you bring other women into the, into your bed with your wife?  Jennifer's lawyer, Dominic Barber, asked the surprise shock shock.  No, I didn't. 
[02:06:30]  Yes, I snapped.  Says the WNW personality snapped.  Were you lying on the witness stand at that point?  Hey, I, first of all, look, see everything in this article?  No, Rick, that's fine.  Look, see everything, every quote in this article?  Yeah.  I stand by everything that I said in here.  Okay.  So, yes, I stand by that.  All right.  That answer.  Very good.  Put two and two together.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[02:07:00]  It's four.  Two and two, Frenchie.  It's making a joke.  And four equals?  Group sex.  We learned that today.  There was no four.  Four.  Six.  Stop it.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Two for every boy.  All right.  Wasn't there another woman you were seeing during the marriage, Barbara asked?  Or followed?  Yeah.  Uh, yes.  Yeah.  Cumia replied sheepishly. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Was she one of the thirdsome bed?  What?  Was she one of the thirdsome bed?  Oh, I get it.  Okay.  Barbara asked.  Yes, answered Cumia the first.  And as it turned out, only witness to be called to the stand before state Supreme Court  Justice, Joan, blah, blah.  And for testifying for about three hours, the Whip-Em-Out Wednesday's co-creator.  Is that my, is that my moniker?  I'm the Whip-Em-Out Wednesday co-creator.  Co-creator.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday coming back strong. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  Within a week.  Uh, co-creator abruptly settled the case after discovering reporters were sitting in the  courtroom.  Don't make yourself sound so important, diarrhea Gregorian, whatever the hell your name is.  Believe me, the fact that you two were sitting there had no bearing on whether this would  be settled or not.  This guy hates you? 
[02:08:30]  Uh, Gary.  Three reasons why I hate Anthony.  Yeah.  Ten million dollars a year, all the poontang you can possibly look at and touch in your  studio every day.  Yeah.  And then you've got to have three of them in bed, you bastard.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry for that one, Eric.  Thank you, Opie.  Okay.  Oops.  Uh, uh, all right.  So you're the co-creator.  Abruptly settled the case after discovering reporters were sitting in the courtroom.  The terms of the deal are confidential. 
[02:09:00]  Confidential.  Again.  Confidential.  Will you be able to, uh, pay for coffee still?  I think I could scrape up the change that falls behind the couch or something.  All right.  Uh, Kumi is, uh...  What?  I'm just reading this, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Uh-huh. 
[02:09:30]  Kumi's testimony began, uh, with his recounting his rise to fame and bantering back and forth  with Barbara, a regular on rival Howard Stern's radio show.  Mm-hmm.  Kumi has said he was working for an air conditioning company in the late 80s, but that his talents  for mimicry occasionally landed him on Stern's show.  Mimicry.  Mimicry.  Right.  When Barbara, the fat F, asked him what characters he'd mimic...  Now, see, you're editorializing again, Opie.  It doesn't say...  He replied...  Excuse me? 
[02:10:00]  I believe I could imitate you, you goddamn fat, money-grubbing, publicity...  No!  Whorebag!  See, it says, I believe I used to do Dominic Barber.  You want to hear it?  I just can't seem to sweat while I breathe.  No!  That isn't in the article, either.  Oh, it's over here.  I'm sorry.  Take that off the record.  Uh, when Barbara asked, uh, what characters he'd mimic, he replied, I believe I used to  do Dominic Barber. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I know.  I got it here, Rick.  Thank you.  Later, the ample and rotund attorney...  It just says ample in mind, but I do believe that is funny enough, that they did put, you  know, I'm, uh, what am I?  The co-creator, raunchy, sheepish, the co-creator of Whip Him Out Wednesday.  He gets ample.  The ample attorney.  Later, the ample and rotund attorney accused Kumia of talking about Jennifer on there and 
[02:11:00]  said, you discussed not only your wife, but your wife's lawyer, correct?  Barbara added, you made some fat jokes about him.  And you said, yeah, you're fat, you effing loser.  I didn't say that.  It says here, Kumia laughed.  But the judge said he didn't have to answer.  But I've been with you a while, and I could read into, you know...  Me laughing?  Yeah, it says Kumia laughing.  I know what you're laughing about. 
[02:11:30]  Kumia laughed, but the judge said he didn't have to answer.  Right.  The syndicated yapper...  The syndicated yapper...  Yapper.  ...said he first met Jennifer back in 1987, but they didn't start dating until 1989.  They married seven months later, but Kumia couldn't remember when.  Again.  Again.  With the goddamn date that I couldn't remember.  What's up with that? 
[02:12:00]  And there you have it, I believe.  There you go.  All you need to know.  Well, there it is.  It's right there in black and white.  And that's what you did on your winter vacation.  That's my vacation.  You dick.  The Russell Crowe of radio. 
[02:12:30]  Get out of here.  Terry and Janine, what's going on today?  Hi, yeah, we'd like to do the 6 o'clock quiz.  Ah.  Yes.  In honor of it, will both of you be doing it at the same time?  No, I can't do it.  My friend can do it.  Two girls for every boy.  She was the greatest piece of the last I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world.  All right, so your friend can do it.  Yeah, I can do it.  My friend can do it. 
[02:13:00]  Do you want to talk to her?  Yeah, let's talk to her.  Okay, hold on here.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  You must be Janine?  Yeah.  All right, and you could do the 6 o'clock queef?  Yep.  You know what we're looking for?  No, what?  You know what to do, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And are you ready to do it?  Yeah, when can I do it?  Right now?  No, we've got to play the theme song.  Of course.  Hold on a second.  I'm ready to play.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles. 
[02:13:30]  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar.  Tense up and let them drop to the floor.  What did I do it?  Not for you.  All right now, Janine.  All right.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:14:00]  You want more?  Um, no.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar. 
[02:14:30]  Queef.  Very good.  All right.  We better take a break here.  All righty.  And we'll start the show next.  We got to talk about Celine Dion.  Celine.  You want to talk about allegations.  Yeah.  And Nixon.  More stuff on the Nixon tapes.  Cue up a gay song.  We'll talk about Nixon.  Next. 
[02:15:00]  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That thing's hilarious.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Want to thank Philly today.  We're hearing good things from Philly.  We're hearing we did a little more gooder than last month. 
[02:15:30]  More gooder.  Still doing more gooder in Philly.  That's the rumor anyway.  The company doesn't really get the ratings anymore.  So you kind of go.  You have to go by hearsay.  So thanks.  And it's time to start the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  At quarter after six.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now Opie we can bask in other people's misery.  Get back on track.  And goof on other people's miserable lives.  And miserable marriages.  Every night in my dreams.  I did not know what the ramme was up to.  While we were undergoing fertility. 
[02:16:30]  Wait.  This song takes on a whole new meaning man.  I hope she doesn't see her husband in her dreams.  Because she's not going to be liking what she's seeing.  There's elevators involved and everything else.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me go back.  Sorry Anthony.  Or Celine.  Thank you.  It seems my husband Rene.  And please excuse me for all the times I use the word allegedly in this story. 
[02:17:00]  Because I don't want to get sued again.  Far across the distance and space.  So Celine's husband faces suit in Las Vegas sex charges.  No.  Well two just separately.  Near, far, wherever you are. 
[02:17:30]  And I don't know where you are or what you're doing.  But it doesn't sound good.  Because a lawyer for Rene, Angelil, husband and manager of Celine Dion, Canadian pop diva.  Stranguously denied yesterday that Angelil had fondled an ordained Baptist minister in a Las Vegas elevator two years ago 
[02:18:00]  and sexually assaulted her in her hotel room.  The accusations come in a lawsuit filed by Yang Kuang Chang-Pang.  Chang Yang Kuang Chang.  Filed by Sidney Poitore. 
[02:18:30]  A Los Angeles resident and a minister of the Full Gospel World Church.  That sounds like one of those fake churches.  The Ann's press office acknowledged yesterday that Abiqui Angelil had made a confidential payment to Kwan  to keep the charges from becoming public.  It seems Angelil saw a post and news reporter in the courtroom and decided to pay Kwan. 
[02:19:00]  But Sid Angelil is now eager to fight the lawsuit.  Well, now those are allegations.  Allegedly.  I read this story over the weekend.  It was a little more involved than a paragraph.  Where the hell is the story on this? 
[02:19:30]  It got pretty good.  What were they saying in the story you read?  This is the one I read.  Didn't have much detail.  It seems that this was during the time where Celine and Angelil...  René.  I thought his name was just René.  Where does that come from?  René Angelil.  That's his last name?  I thought it was Mr. Dion.  It seems that she was undergoing all that fertility treatment to have a child.  And he was undergoing cancer treatment for his throat cancer. 
[02:20:00]  So she's undergoing all this fertility stuff to have a kid.  Right.  And he's walking around one of these hotels in Vegas.  So he sees that he's walking around with a security guy, one of his guys.  He sees this Asian chick at, like, one of the machines. 
[02:20:30]  Slot machines or something.  So he goes over to her and starts sparking up a little conversation.  And saying he wanted to give her tickets to a show.  Oh, good, good.  Tickets to a show.  Good move.  That's a good move.  Good move.  And she accepts the tickets.  And then heads for the elevator.  René follows.  Follows?  Follows.  Oh, good, good.  Follows to the elevator. 
[02:21:00]  I guess they have some kind of conversation in the elevator.  They get to the floor where the woman's room is.  She, at some point, they passed through a lobby before this happened.  This is all allegedly, right?  Yeah, all allegedly.  Of course.  She passed through the hotel lobby.  As she says now, she was looking for security.  She couldn't find any.  So she decided she'd ditch him by going to her room.  So they get in the elevator together, go up, and he forced his way into the room as she 
[02:21:30]  was trying to get in and, you know, close the door behind her.  And that's when he began fondling her.  And then had some sort of sexual encounter with her.  Encounter.  Encounter.  With her.  No police were involved.  Right.  And, um...  But the hotel security was told about this.  And I guess they just, you know, conveniently forgot it.  He wound up paying her some kind of money. 
[02:22:00]  Just to get it out of the way, I guess.  And now that it's out, he's going to fight it.  But what does it sound like to you?  A chick that wants some cash, had some consensual sex with the guy, and now trying to get some  money, or did he go into the room and, uh, you know, rape her?  Hmm.  I feel so left out.  I feel so dirty and so left out.  This should not happen to a star like me. 
[02:22:30]  I will not let it.  I'll show him.  Hello?  Hello, is this Radio DJ Anthony?  Do you have room in your bed for Celine Dion?  My husband Rene has ditched me.  I hear you have a giant Rockaway bed.  Rockaway bedding. 
[02:23:00]  That is how I...  And people just fall into it on a nightly basis.  Would you accept me and my huge, giant camel pole?  All across the distance, and spaces, and two girls for every time.  No, no, that's another story.  Here, far, where, how many girls in the bed?  No, no. 
[02:23:30]  Near, far, group sex, group sex.  I cannot believe he did that.  I guess Celine's going to have a press conference Wednesday.  I look so hot in my jumpsuit, with my big camel pole.  How could he go after an Asian girl?  You know how they have squat little legs, flat asses, and no breasts?  I look so much hotter. 
[02:24:00]  I hear Rene.  This is what I hear.  He did it in the balloon knot.  And the girl scurried to a fertility clinic, and had her put it in the right place.  That's another story.  And it was that?  No, that's another story.  That's Meg.  Oh.  That's Laura Korn's Meg.  It was Laura Korn's apartment.  Yeah, no.  Not a hotel.  No, that's a...  She did the duck walk to the fertility.  That's another story.  Holding...  That's what I hear. 
[02:24:30]  I'm suing.  I'm suing Laura Korn.  My fat attorney, Dominic Barber, will get me money.  Hey, Rob.  What's going on?  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Welcome back.  Oh, thanks, Rob.  Hey, can Celine Dion disclose the details of the divorce?  You know, if it's in character.  No comment.  Celine has no comment.  I have my own problems.  Thank you, Rob. 
[02:25:00]  Well, that's going to be an interesting press conference.  I can't wait to see the rest of that on Wednesday.  Yeah.  Bill, what's going on?  Yeah, how you guys doing?  All right, Bill.  Did you ever see South Park this week?  I replied sheepishly before I snapped.  Did we see South Park, the Maury Povich episode?  It was funny, right?  Yeah, it seemed...  It was funny the first time I heard it on your show.  Whatever.  It seemed a little familiar, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  That's true.  Whatever.  I'll do what I want.  It seemed a little familiar.  They did a great job.  Yeah, very funny.  With the latest episode of South Park.  Maury pretty much telling the deformed people on the show that they're special and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sensing a theme, though, with their season.  Huh?  I'm sensing a theme with their season.  That's two bits that they stole from you guys, basically.  What was the other one?  Yeah, you know, the tragedy one. 
[02:26:00]  Now you have to wait, you know, to make fun of the tragedy.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  We were the...  You know what?  We hate fun of this game.  Well, yeah.  I'm not even going to go into it.  But it's just...  When you see some things that are familiar, I take it as a compliment.  The whole Maury thing was really funny.  They had Maury Povich on South Park.  And they were trying...  They noticed how Maury has his freak show.  The Maury Povich freak show, which we've called it here many, many times.  And they figured they'd get Butters to make believe he has a scrotum on his chin.  So they used some kind of prosthetics to make it look that way with golf balls to win a trip. 
[02:26:30]  Because they noticed all the little freaks get a trip to somewhere or something fun to do.  And when Butters was the only one that got the prize, Cartman decides he's going to go on.  And he dressed like a girl.  And it was an out-of-control teen show.  And it was hysterical.  You get a chance to see it.  But the one really funny part was the progeria kid.  Yeah, little kids look like they're little old men.  I've got the body of a 90-year-old.  I'm only...  I'm six years old. 
[02:27:00]  I'm waiting for the Make-A-Wish Foundation to get back to me and take me to Disney.  And they better get back within, oh, five minutes.  And I'm going to age another ten years.  But you're a regular kid.  I'm a regular kid.  I enjoy doing regular things.  Yeah, I play baseball.  I wear the hats slightly sideways.  Because people think it's cute.  On my big, big, bulbous head.  My skull, thin as a rolling paper.  You see right through it.  A wet rolling paper. 
[02:27:30]  So it was, yeah, a little familiar things on that show.  A little bit, a little bit.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Welcome back.  All right.  Welcome back, multimillionaire Anthony.  Yeah.  Yo, did you hear about that kid, Stephen?  Wait, this is a real story?  That was on Seattle MTV.  Stephen was Seattle MTV, real world.  And he slapped the chick that was suffering from the Lyme disease.  Yeah, remember?  She was calling him a fag and he was swearing he wasn't.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Irene.  Irene was the girl suffering from the Lyme disease. 
[02:28:00]  Is that the, one of the, yeah, when she left the house and, yeah, Stephen.  If you want a smoking gun, there's a picture of him on there.  He was arrested for male prostitution.  So listen in and how he did that, man.  Why, Mary?  That's all you guys want to know.  It's funny as hell.  The picture of him.  Yeah, that was before.  That was before.  He got arrested this time because he took somebody's car and they found that he had priors for a prostitution that he didn't show up to court for.  Nice.  All right, well, either way, it's still funny. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Wait a minute, boy.  Don't let facts get in the way of a funny story.  All right.  A star of MTV's real world series was just busted in Los Angeles for swiping a car.  And in a far more interesting criminal twist, has a separate arrest warrant pending for failing to appear in court to answer misdemeanor charges stemming from his arrest last year for, of all things, prostitution.  Oops.  Steven Williams, 23, was arrested Tuesday morning and charged with taking a 1988 Toyota Camry without the owner's consent. 
[02:29:00]  Williams, who has pleaded not guilty to the auto count, is being held in lieu of bail at L.A.'s men's central jail.  According to the below sheriff's record, when LAPD cops arrested Williams, a cast member in the real world series set in Seattle and a recent participant in MTV's real world road rules challenge,  they discovered he was wanted for failing to make court appearances related to a January 2001 arrest on two misdemeanor counts.  According to the criminal complaint filed against Williams by the L.A. city attorney, he got popped for hustling in Hollywood with police alleging that he entered a vehicle in furtherance of his solicitation bid. 
[02:29:30]  I suck it!  Uh, the second misdemeanor rap charges Williams with loitering in a public place with the intent to commit prostitution.  According to MTV's website, Williams works as a talent booker and on-air talent for, uh, hotshow.com, an internet radio audio site.  But the defunct site's owner, David, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:30:00]  Baggot?  And then they say he was the one that struck Irene, uh, during the show.  Yes.  Wow, look at that.  Bishlapta.  Look at that.  Lots of scandal.  Scandal in all the papers, Opie.  Boy, you know, until, uh, until some of your, um, until some, uh, newspaper prints, uh, any of your sexual scandal, Opie, you know, it's a little odd. 
[02:30:30]  I felt like, uh, like, uh, you know, Joey Butta Fuco.  Joey Butta Fuco.  Well, you get this whole thing where you're like, oh, you know, first I get this call.  Man, man, it's Joe, man.  My, my brother.  Man, pick up the phone.  You there?  All right, just, uh, calling, uh, solar tape.  Uh, give me a call.  Yeah.  Dick.  So I, uh, not taking that one. 
[02:31:00]  Dude, I left a familiar, uh, one very similar.  Oh, I know.  Hi, Anthony, it's Mom.  Hi, how are you?  Um, well, give me a call.  Um, just saying hi.  Give me a call.  Right now I'm just going to take some morphine and drink until I get this horrific image out of my head that was put there by the newspaper.  Horrific image that will not ever go away.  He didn't say that's my boy. 
[02:31:30]  You get those, you know.  Yeah, I understand.  I think I got one from Keith, too.  Keith the cop?  Hey, Keith the cop.  You're in the paper.  You're in the paper.  I don't know if you saw it or know.  Gee, Columbo, that's a good one.  You're a cop.  You know, I just want to say, you know, it's hard because you put yourself out there. 
[02:32:00]  And, you know, people don't know you're a person.  I don't know.  What should I do?  You can act like a man.  What do I want to do?  All right.  We better take a break and play what do we learn next.  It's that time, believe it or not.  All right.  An interesting day.  And we'll go to the phones next.  The Opie and Anthony F.U.

Unfortunately, it is.  How old are you?  27.  And you're a girl, right?

I learned a couple things today.  All right.  First, it's either a stack or two or three.  And I also learned that the menage a trois was just the tip of the iceberg that made Anthony settle out of court. 
[02:36:30]  Where did you learn that?  Well, innuendo.  So, innuendo.  Innuendo.  Innuendo.  Yeah, well, you know.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  There was any innuendo there was spelled out.

I don't think so.  The new cities.  Go to opieandanthony.com. 
[02:37:00]  opieandanthony.com.  Stones fan from New Hampshire.  I learned on the ONA show today it took almost as long to get Ann's divorce details as it did for a black woman to win the Best Actress Oscar.  A newspaper photographer caught Anthony with part of his peacock showing.  Three people is a menage a trois.  Four or more is group sex.  Yes, we did learn that.  And finally, being on the kiss cam at an Islander game is never cool.  Spiceless.  I'm back from Clifton.  Today I learned that town hall still, still, still isn't sold out. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, buy those tickets, man.  Yes, enough.  Jim Norton's going to be on Colin Quinn's show tonight and he's going to be at town hall April 18th.  Right.  John from Port Washington.  I learned today that opie and Anthony are worth more than some countries.  Sheep lover.  I learned today sheepishly is a real word.  Sheepishly.  You also learned opie's worth 30 million more because his name is first.  That's a crock of crap.  Man, dude.  That's a crock of crap. 
[02:38:00]  All I'm saying is, um, I'll say one thing.  We tried it.  We tried the Anthony and opie, but it didn't flow as good as the other way.  No, no.  I'm just going to say one thing.  And this is the only thing I'll disclose from those closed settlement things.  Oh, get your pens out.  Sussy.  Here it is.  The only thing I will disclose.  At one point, the judge turns, turns to me, like grabbed my hand and went pre-nup. 
[02:38:30]  The judge grabbed my hand, looked right at me, shook my hand a little, went pre-nup.  And I was like, I was a, I was a tin knocker.  What the hell did I want?  I, you know, ooh, I better protect my 28 grand.  Woo-hoo.  Look out.  Mine.  You know, but any, I would say that now to anybody.

You want to be mad at him, but he went after Dominic for you.  No, he didn't. 
[02:39:30]  All right, Frenchie.  Thank you.  Let me pre...  How do you spell nup?  Pre-nup.  I don't know.  Get a lawyer to figure out how to spell it.  Nup.  Nup?  Nup.  You're 130 mil, Opie.  Oh, that's me.  130 million.  That's me.  Look at it.  Dan, what's up?  I learned a couple of things today.  Yeah.  I learned the price of freedom is about $50 million.  I also learned that divorce court will give you all timers.  I can't remember anything.  I'm 13. 
[02:40:00]  I wrote, uh...  Ian ain't cheating.  If you eat around, it ain't considered sex.  Talk to you later, guys.  Thank you.  Al Mack from Clifton.  And I learned that Halle Berry's mom is whiter than Sidney Poitier's wife.  Sidney Poitier's wife.  Sidney Poitier.  Sheep lover also learned, uh...  A hundred million each means you know how far to take it.  Bobby from Queens.  I learned Lisa, uh...  The sales girl's working on her Anthony impression. 
[02:40:30]  Oh!  That's good.  That's real good.  Very funny.  Mm-hmm.  Boston.  Sheep lover also learned, uh...  All the white in Halle Berry is what helped her win the Oscar last night.  Mm-hmm.

Let's go to Aaron.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  You just took my line.  Really?  Did we?  I'm sorry. 
[02:41:00]  It was the Capistrano thing, March 19th.  Ah, March 19th.  It's all this day.  Later, guys.  Sorry about that, bro.  No problem.  All right.  It was a very big day back in, uh...  When I was a kid.  During the Dreamweaver days.  When I had my horse.  Anthony.  Yo, O.N.A., what's up?  Hey.  Yo, I learned that we shouldn't commend Anthony for having a threesome.  We should commend Anthony for having a threesome while working as an air-conditioning repairman.  Yo, O.P.  Hey, that was Colin Quinn.  Yeah, go ahead, man.  Oh! 
[02:41:30]  You got so smoked on that.  You got so smoked.  Jim Norton would be proud today.  Oh.  Bastard.  Let's go to Isaac.  Isaac, what's going on?  Goddamn, I can't believe you just got called on that.  I saw that one coming a mile away.  Oh, I'm a little slow today.  All right.  I learned, uh, you don't have to make $100 million in radio to know you don't give your  best bit up at the beginning.  But we gave you guys some good bits in the beginning.  Come on, that, uh... 
[02:42:00]  The Halle Berry stuff?  Funny.  Top shelf, top shelf.  Top shelf, top notch, top notch.  I felt like a bass on a line getting jerked through the water all day.  You know what the difference is, though, Isaac?  We admit it on this show.  We told you guys a long time ago.  5-20, 5-20, 5-20.  Right.  But 5-20 could mean anything, any time after 5.  MJ, why not Yemen?  Peace out.  Why not?  Why not?  All the other ones will come up with a...  Oh, real...  Oh, look. 
[02:42:30]  Oh.  Oh.  We tell you, we know.  It did, uh, come across our thought process to wait till tomorrow.  No.  No, that would have really been bad.  We didn't discuss that?  Yeah.  All right.

Anyone can win.  Anyone can win.  So, just give us a call.  It doesn't matter where you're calling from.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  And with that, uh, thank you.  We'll talk about Nixon tomorrow.  Yeah.  That's something we tease a little bit.  And the faggots.  And the figs.  His take on the homos.  I love it.  I read this story and, uh, laughed my ass off.  Now, is that a 520 bit? 
[02:44:00]  520.  I'm thinking.  That's when Tricky Dick talks about the fagg in homo.  I'm thinking either that or go right at three.  Uh-huh.  Replay it at 520.  Less stuff you and I have to worry about.  Oh, God.  We'll get assassinated.  Whole new audience, uh, listening at 520 that, uh, wasn't listening at three.  Uh, another radio trick, my friend.  And right now, I'm fighting for the, uh, audience.  I'm saying no.  Okay.  Wait till tomorrow.  We'll see what we got on the plate. 
[02:44:30]  Home out. </pre>
