<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts establishing their "bad boy" persona, immediately launching into a discussion of a paparazzi photo of Britney Spears, focusing heavily and crudely on her physique.  They transitioned to "Girls Next Door," speculating on the motivations of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends and sharing an anecdote about a Hefner after-party where a girlfriend was fired for kissing Rob Schneider.  The show then shifted to sports, covering the Anaheim Ducks' Stanley Cup victory and the NBA Finals, with Opie displaying limited basketball knowledge.  They announced upcoming guests: Nicole Richie (rumored to be pregnant), Brian Regan, and Chuck Liddell, jokingly suggesting a studio fight between Regan and Liddell.  A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to personal accounts of road rage, including Anthony's story of hitting a pedestrian and having his mirror broken, and a broader discussion of the pedestrian-motorist conflict in New York City.

The show then discussed news reports about Nicole Richie's potential pregnancy and a man's attempt to grab the Popemobile, analyzing the incident's video footage and the Swiss Guard's response.  The hosts connected this to intrusive thoughts, sharing their own experiences, and a female caller confessed to jumping on "Cowbell Man" at a sporting event, also discussing her own intrusive thoughts.  They promoted their upcoming comedy show, hinting at a special announcement for New York fans, and ended the segment with unresolved internal staff conflict.

A Father's Day contest dominated a significant portion, offering a date at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch to a lucky father, courtesy of Dennis Hof.  Legal wording proved challenging initially.  Numerous listener calls nominated fathers, often detailing marital unhappiness, widowhood, or lack of intimacy, frequently involving infidelity, divorce, and personal tragedies.  Some callers even nominated themselves and their fathers. The hosts interviewed Bear and his wife Louise, who hadn't had sex in twelve years, engaging in a lengthy and sexually explicit conversation about their marriage, sex life, and their numerous cats.  Chuck Liddell, Nicole Richie, and Brian Regan were briefly mentioned again as upcoming guests, and the hosts promoted a Jones Beach comedy show with a ticket special.

A follow-up call with Louise and Bear (Jimmy) further detailed their 18-year sexless marriage and Bear's candidacy for the Bunny Ranch trip.  Louise candidly compared Bear's sexual performance to her previous partners, explicitly stating her lack of desire for sex with him and indifference towards his potential Bunny Ranch date. The hosts continued their sexually explicit questioning.  Following this, in-studio guests Brian Regan and Chuck Liddell joined, along with a phone call from Nicole Richie.  Regan discussed his career and hecklers; Liddell talked about his recent UFC loss and future; and Richie promoted "The Simple Life Goes to Camp," referencing rumors and her father's famous clay head.  The segment concluded with further discussion of UFC events and the Father's Day giveaway, with the hosts teasing their guests throughout.

[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shot shots, Opie and Anthony.

[00:04:00]  Oh, it's...  Uh, wardrobe?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What are you doing in depth?  I've been hanging a lot with JFK.  He's the life of the party, let me tell you.  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos. 
[00:04:30]  And he fills his head with salsa.  It's time for people to understand, these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What a way to start the morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  We're looking at an awful picture of Britney Spears' ass. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, this one's been making the rounds for a couple of days.  My God, man.  And, uh, just as we had predicted on this very program.  What was that?  That she was just going to turn into a complete mess.  She has turned into a complete mess.  You know, you've used that observation since the first day we started working together.  About how, uh, you know, her butt looks like she sat in a...  Gravel driveway.  A gravel driveway too much and just stood up.  Yeah.  That's what her ass looks like that we're looking at right now. 
[00:05:30]  It's all flattened out.  Dude, I haven't even had my second cup of coffee.  This is too early.  Too early.  Too early for this.  It's sagging where you can see where her thigh meets butt cheek.  You know that little...  On a hot girl, like what she used to be.  It's like a curve.  It's an actual curve.  This is now a crease.  And the whole cheeks, both of them, are just, like, decimated with a cellulite. 
[00:06:00]  Cellulite, dimples, like lots of dimples.  Yeah.  The right leg has so much cellulite.  It looks like, uh, like an elephant's trunk.  Yeah.  Right?  What the hell?  And do we all remember what that ass used to look like?  And then I'm like, there's no way that's her ass.  And then, of course, they have another picture where they zoom out to show that it's Britney Spears walking.  It's her.  Where's she?  Yeah.  It's her.  Huh? 
[00:06:30]  Where was that?  Uh, I have no idea.  I think she's vacationing somewhere, of course, because that's what she does.  Yeah, that's the latest picture of her.  There you go.  She's got a little, uh, beach wrap on.  A sarong.  A sarong.  And it, like, blew up in the back.  And, oh, oof.  Look at that, man.  What a way to start.  Well, good morning.  That moonscape ass.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  If you want to check out, uh, uh, this lovely ass picture. 
[00:07:00]  Where are we at today there, E-Rock?  We'll have it up on our site in a few minutes.  Oh, you're going to make people go to our site.  Very, very, very, very smart.  Well, there's nervous E-Rock slurping up some, uh, water.  Poor E-Rock.  Yeah.  And then just before the show, um, they had a clip from, uh, the girls next door.  I guess there's some controversy.  I don't even know what it's about.  I don't even have a nurse show.  Yeah.  Where he has, like, three, like, uh, girlfriends. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Three fake girlfriends.  He started with seven fake girlfriends, and now he's down to three fake girlfriends.  They ought to tap out the other ones.  Yeah.  And, uh, I guess a lot of people watch girls next door.  And, uh...  Do they?  And only one really likes half, and the other two are there just for the publicity and to  get the...  Yeah.  You know, get a little, uh, exposure for themselves when they move on from the old...  The old...  The old guy.  The old codger.  Yeah.  But, uh, uh, it's...  Have you watched the show?  The show is the equivalent of the old radio gag where you gotta keep your hand on the car 
[00:08:00]  and the last one there wins.  Because, obviously, the girls are bailing out.  Yeah.  And there's, like you said, three left.  One of them really seems, uh, into them.  But I think she's gonna be the one with her car, with her hand on the car last.  And she's gonna get, like, the Hefner fortune, uh, by maybe marrying the guy or something.  She really looks like she's in love with the guy, which is...  Maybe she's a great actress, because when they kiss, it is so heinous to watch.  Well, the other two, when Hef goes in for a kiss, they all turn their heads real fast 
[00:08:30]  and get the cheek kiss.  But the one goes in for full lip kissing with, uh, Hugh Hefter.  Yeah.  The pigtails, is that the girl?  Well, they're all blonde.  I don't know.  I can't tell one from the other.  Yeah, I can't tell either.  But, um, but Hef walks around with his hearing aids.  He walks around in his, uh, pajamas.  Yeah.  I was telling Anthony, like, when he was in his late 30s, early 40s, it was cool to be  in his pajamas, you know?  He's in his pajamas at the mansion with that pipe, and he's just like, hey, ladies, and 
[00:09:00]  you know, bedding down with all of them.  And you know the reason he had his pajamas, he didn't, he was banging so many women, he  didn't have time to actually dress.  Get dressed in clothes.  Right, he's like, ah, I might as well just walk around with pajamas.  Let's goo up the old skimmer in the grotto.  Right.  That's what he would do, just drop his robe.  But now it's creepy, because, you know, he's keeping the pajama thing going, but he's an  80-year-old man, and he does, like, the slipper shuffle.  He's got hearing aids, and it just looks creepy. 
[00:09:30]  And Kendra, one of the girls, she, uh...  Kendra?  Yeah, Kendra, she's in it just to get her face known and some publicity.  Like, she's disgusted by Hugh Hefner.  She's the one that definitely changes, you know, turns her cheek if Hugh comes in for a  kiss.  Yeah.  Yeah, she can't be bothered with Hugh Hefner.  What are their names?  I'll tell you which one is his main one.  Uh, Kendra, Holly, and, uh...  Holly, I think, is his main...  What was the third one?  Ah, I don't know.  Holly, I think, is the...  They were on Larry King, all of them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  And Holly's the main one. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah, Bridget.  All I know is I went to that after party after the Hugh Hefner roast, and all his girls were  there, and I think he had seven at the time.  I think all seven were around him, and I saw one of them making out with Rob Schneider  on a stairway coming down in the club, and me and my girl were just laughing, going, yeah,  oh, that's Hef's girl right there just making out with Rob Schneider.  And, uh, later on, we saw Hef's manager, this woman, a handler, I guess she handles these 
[00:10:30]  women, uh, just yelling at this crying blonde who wheeled out with Schneider, and, um, she  apparently got fired.  Oh, really?  And that was her getting the old shove, because she made Hef look bad by...  She got fired from being one of his girlfriends?  Making out with Deuce Bigelow.  Good for a Hef.  He's 80, and he's not sharing with some second-rate B-movie actor.  He shouldn't.  Beat it, bitch.  You're out.  Scram.  What was her name?  She's gone.  What a dope... 
[00:11:00]  I can't get enough of the show, because it is just, just creepy.  He's got the big hearing aids.  Yeah.  They do movie night in his bed, and the girls lay around, and only one, like, lays next  to him, and the other two are as far away on the bed as possible.  It just, it doesn't work anymore.  That was a whole thing.  I've seen old clips.  You ever see the black and white clips of the Playboy?  There was a show, a TV show.  Yeah.  It was like, it was, I can't remember the name of it, but it was something, Playboy After  Dark, I think it was called, and Hef would come out, and it was black and white, and he'd 
[00:11:30]  come out and go, hi, I'm Hugh Hefner, with his pipe and his robe, and I'm going to show  you the world of erotic blah, blah, blah, blah, and he'd just spout off some crap and show  the girls.  He was very articulate.  Yeah.  He knew a little about everything.  Yeah, and he just looked like the cool guy, and everybody wanted to be Hef.  Yeah.  And now it's, ooh, you just, you feel bad for him.  It's like watching your grandpa get abused by these women. 
[00:12:00]  It's horrible.  And he, you know, he's so-  I don't think he's liking it.  He's so old now, he wears the captain hat.  A lot of old dudes have to wear the captain hat.  The captain of-  All aboard, it's the Grim Reaper ship.  Well, you got to give him this.  The SS Flaccid.  Nah, he's the captain of Poo-Ha.  You got to give him that.  I think he was at some point.  I think it's all an act now.  I think it's all an act.  Yeah.  I don't think he's-  Do you think that guy has the endurance to satisfy three girls in the sack like that? 
[00:12:30]  Get out of here.  You think it's possible to actually get turned off from the Poo-Ha?  Not turned off.  But I mean, you're 80, you've had every type of Poo-Ha possible.  He did actually experiment with homosexuality years ago because he got-  Miles Davis did the same thing.  And they got so many girls.  He just wanted to-  Experiment.  That's what he tried.  Let me tell you something.  I could live to 120. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I could take a spaceship to the planet Poo-Ha.  Did he get it?  I don't know.  You might want to try that again there.  I said, I could take a spaceship to the planet Poo-Ha and never-  Get bored of it?  Want to turn to Poo-Ha.  That's Hef, though.  It doesn't matter if it's Hef.  He probably did it to be silly. 
[00:13:30]  Silly?  I don't have a pipe.  Come here, fella.  Look, putting the lampshade on your head and dancing around at a party is silly.  Taking a-  He was knocking them back like three, four a day easily.  Easily.  Players couldn't get a drink at the table.  So, I don't-  You go back over the years, there's probably 50, 60 girls he slept with.  Yeah, perhaps more than that, Jim.  All right, but I don't know.  I can't get enough of that show and how just god-awful and creepy it is. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, it's another one of those fake reality shows, I think.  I don't think that's really going on.  No.  You know, like I said, the type of endurance you need.  He doesn't look like he's working out or anything.  You know what I mean?  I don't think he's got the wind for it.  They were taking turns for a while.  Oof.  But I don't think Kendra ever took a turn because they had her 21st birthday party at  the mansion.  Oh, oh, gosh.  And he's 80.  Oh.  That's even creepy for us. 
[00:14:30]  We might need this audio.  Why?  I don't know, because it's about-  Oh, no, it's just-  Nicole Richie might be pregnant.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we're supposed to be talking to her today.  Yeah, we'll have Nicole Richie on the show a little later on.  Well, at least she'll gain some of that weight back if she's pregnant.  What you said, we're supposed to have her on, Opie.  Perhaps you could wait until the phone call.  All right, I'll wait.  Before you say anything that might-  All right, I'll wait.  Yeah.  Also, we have Brian Regan coming in today.  Hey.  And Chuck Liddell. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  Very, very cool.  I hear Brian's going to fight Chuck right here in our studio.  We should-  Hey, no, you're a nice guy and all that.  That's great.  We should surprise Brian Regan with a UFC match with Chuck Liddell.  You see Brian just beats the crap out of him.  Right.  I'm going to go, wow, that Regan should take on a heckler, can't he?  Oh, you've got to imagine that Regan's got some anger in him somewhere.  I've got a good spinning back kick.  As soon as Regan walks in the studio waving, we should just have Liddell blindside him. 
[00:15:30]  Just lock him.  Well, it's what he does.  Regan would be all nice about it.  It's what he does.  You know, it's his job and everything.  Yeah.  I don't mind him punching me.  Just shoulder blocking right into that television.  You see Regan's head crack the screen.  I'm like, ow, hey, that hurt.  What else is going on as we all wake up this morning?  Wow, I didn't even know this was going on, and I'm a huge hockey fan, I've got to tell you.  I really am.  I love my Islanders.  I got season tickets.  And then when my Islanders were out, I was going for the Sabres.  Yeah.  I was rooting for the Sabres considering I spent about 10 years in western New York. 
[00:16:00]  They got dumped out.  They got knocked out, whatever.  And then I was like, all right, hockey's over for this year.  Yeah, you were done.  But I guess the Anaheim Ducks won their first Stanley Cup last night.  Yeah.  You would think I would have watched the games, but I didn't care.  No one really does.  But when it's June and they're still playing hockey and your team's not in it, it just doesn't feel right to watch hockey.  Yeah.  And no one really cared.  So they won the Stanley Cup last night, and then of course we've got to say hi to Cleveland because King James goes for the title tonight. 
[00:16:30]  Who?  King James.  Come on.  Get on board with King James, the next Jordan.  Does he play hockey?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's King James.  Who's in the NBA Finals?  Why do they call him?  Let's start there.  Who's in the NBA Finals?  Is that the National Basketball Association?  Yes.  Oh.  And in the Finals.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll say the...  Now, really try.  I'm going to try. 
[00:17:00]  I'm saying the Bulls.  We're on in Chicago, man.  They're a big sports town.  You know something?  You're showing that you...  I know nothing about basketball.  All right.  Give it another...  I like other...  All right.  Give it another try.  Okay.  It's a team...  That team with the big, tall, black guy.  No? 
[00:17:30]  Every team has a big, tall, black guy.  Damn it.  Did it help me out here?  I was hoping you to...  Okay.  I said hi to...  Not the Knicks.  No.  I said hi to Cleveland.  Oh.  The Cleveland...  What's their team?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Cavaliers.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  And who are they playing?  They're playing the team that is from the...  San Antonio. 
[00:18:00]  San Antonio.  The Spurs.  I would have actually known the Spurs if you would have just said San Antonio.  Oh, really?  That's a big thing for me.  Boy, that's pretty impressive.  Name a city.  Let me see if I could name their basketball team.  Orlando.  Magic.  I'm trying to think of cities we're in.  How about Washington?  Washington. 
[00:18:30]  Capitals.  Senators.  The Presidents.  The Utah Jazz.  Yeah, but they don't have Jazz.  Utah.  Right.  Yes, that's because they moved the team.  From where?  From New Orleans.  Very good.  Whew.  The Redskins.  The Redskins.  Now you sound like Brian Regan.  I have no idea.  The Washington... 
[00:19:00]  Duh.  I just could never get into basketball playing it.  Yeah, they used to...  It was the Bullets.  They used to have the greatest name.  The Bullets.  No, they're not the Bullets anymore.  They used to have the greatest name, the Washington Bullets.  But they offended people.  But, of course, sports also has to be PC now.  Yeah.  Which just drives me nuts.  Bullets are very bad.  Hey, and really fast, before we take our first break...  The Wizards.  Washington Wizards.  Who gave you the answer?  Fan.  Yeah, of course.  Thanks, Fan. 
[00:19:30]  I should have known because I was a wizard in EverQuest 2.  Remember?  I was going for my robe and pointy hat.  Eww.  Boy, I really am horrible at basketball.  I just...  I never played it.  I never liked it.  It always seemed like a game that...  Any game where the scoring part of it isn't all that exciting...  Yeah.  ...because you score in the hundreds...  It just never appealed to me.  And when the last minute can just go on forever... 
[00:20:00]  And then I say, why didn't they play like that the whole game?  It's like...  Alright, I'm not a fan of the NBA.  No.  Sorry.  Sorry, people.  That's your Opie connection right there.  And for all you Yankee fans, Roger Clemens...  He's coming back Saturday!  Oh, my God!  Goodness gracious!  Yes, Saturday's the day that Roger finally takes the mound.  We'll see.  Some 25 games after they announced that. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, 25 games.  Something like that.  25 abysmal games.  Yeah, well...  I'm sure Susan Wallman will just lose her mind as that day unfolds.  She's taking so much crap.  She is going to be misconservative.  He can throw a no-hitter and she'll be like, well, congratulations.  Yeah.  Hey, did you see that?  You don't think she's going to be screaming and yelling?  No.  Roger Clemens is walking toward the mound!  It's quite exciting to watch! 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my God!  He's bending down a tire shoe!  Oh, but look at this excitement!  He's grabbing the rosin bag!  He's getting some rosin!  Well, we'll see.  I think it's going to be just a disaster for him.  You know.  Boy, that first outing had better be good.  Nah, I don't think it's going to happen.  What about that scar tissue in his groin?  Oh, God! 
[00:21:30]  I can't even walk thinking about scar tissue in your groin.  And he's got to pitch a game?  Yeah.  And not too much pressure either.  No.  Because he's got to go out there and absolutely kill.  Or else...  Could you see, like, they've got to pull him after the second or third inning?  Everyone's going to watch how he walks out to the mound.  Yep, that's groin scar tissue.  Yeah, I've seen that before.  All right.  The Britney-ass photos are up on our website.  Just the name of the show.  OneWord.com, I guess.  Yeah.  Hey, for the early risers, we've got a pair of tickets to the Traveling Virus Show on June 16th at Jones Beach. 
[00:22:00]  Yes, it's our comedy show.  We're hitting the road this summer.  Next stop is Jones Beach, June 16th.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  We'll give away a pair of tickets right now to a random caller.  877-212-5762.  And it's no secret that we've had a very interesting month.  Sure.  And we're going to try to do something very cool for the fans.  Our little thank you. 
[00:22:30]  I think we should have a little announcement yesterday.  And it has something to do with the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Commentator.  How are we going to possibly have an announcement yesterday?  Did I say yesterday?  Are we going to go back in time?  Opie, do you have a time machine?  Did I really say yesterday?  Yes, you did.  Oh, boy.  An announcement yesterday.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow we'll have a little something-something for the people that have been really cool to us the last month or so.  Yeah.  Okay?  Only for the New York area. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Sorry.  So if you were cool and if you were really supportive of the show and you live in Pittsburgh,  ah, what can I tell you?  No, it's a special thing for the June 16th show at Jones Beach, our comedy show.  Okay?  We should have that announcement tomorrow.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll continue in just a bit.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock. 
[00:23:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-5762.  What do you want to talk about?  Give us a call.  We got to talk about this morning.  We got Brian Regan coming in.  Brian.  We have Chuck Liddell coming in.  Yep.  He was knocked out, man.  We got to talk about that today, huh?  Yes.  Wow.  Was that a big surprise?  I don't even know.  I still don't know.  Liddell was favored.  He was definitely favored.  But Rampage Jackson had beaten him already. 
[00:24:00]  And, I mean, some guys just have your number.  And Rampage Jackson has him by nine years.  That's a big difference when you're fighting, man.  That's a nine-year difference.  Chuck took out two of the three guys that defeated him at some point in his career.  And, yeah, the last one.  I was worried about this one only because, like, Liddell is the champion.  And it's like when you watch Rocky III, it's like after a while, when you're the champion, man, it's like, okay, you have to be vigilant.  But everybody loves you.  Everywhere you go, people are buying you drinks.  Everywhere you go, you're on entourage.  It doesn't make it tougher to, like, be hungry. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  You know, it's got to be because what else is there to achieve?  Rocky working out in the hotel lobby.  Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't that.  That was the worst example of the champion.  Clubber Lang is doing pull-ups in his basement.  I'm sure Liddell didn't do that.  But, you know what I'm saying?  It's got to be hard when life is so good.  And, you know, you're banging all the girls or whatever it is you do when you're a champion.  You're now banging tens instead of fours.  Yeah.  You might get a little distracted from training.  That's all.  Dude, how great that must be to go into a club with any chick that you want and just know that nobody can hit on her. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Like, you know, it's like you're always paranoid that some other guys that come over and just touch your girl's hiney and then make eye contact with you.  And go, what are you going to do?  And then get security.  Hey, you.  Why I ought to.  I'm basically saying.  I won't.  It must be nice to be a real man.  A real man is what you're talking about.  It's things that real men do, Jim.  It's very rare that we're intimidated.  But when he comes in, it's just ridiculous.  But he's the nicest guy, you know? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I know.  He doesn't try to be.  He doesn't seem like a bully.  Like a guy.  He's just a savage guy.  Like, he would probably rather fight a guy that can fight than one of us.  Oh, yeah.  Than one of us.  Yeah.  There's no reason to beat up someone on the radio.  It's silly.  It'd be easy.  I'm a bully.  Like, if you come in here with one leg, I'm going to stare you down.  Yeah, that's it.  We really are awful people in here.  We're bullies.  If you're, like, in your 80s or something like that, and you disrespect me, you might  get smacked in the mouth.  But I don't care who you are. 
[00:26:00]  That's human nature.  Like, just talk about driving and someone, you know, cut you off or something.  Yep.  And if it's like a soccer mom, you're going to do everything.  You're going to just be a complete a-hole on the road.  But if it's some intimidating guy in a pickup truck or a van or something, you're like,  oh, man.  I'll just leave him alone.  He wins.  He wins on this one.  Right.  You know, I drive every day.  My commute is somewhat of a nightmare on the way home, especially of late, since I drive 
[00:26:30]  home a little earlier these days.  And there's a lot of traffic still.  And I am remembering what it was like when we used to drive in together up when we were  doing afternoons.  Yeah.  Holy geez.  You just get to the point where I got to, like, just go, you know something?  I'll get home half hour later.  It's not going to bother me.  But I remember I have like this, this in my DNA, the memory is there of the anger and 
[00:27:00]  the road rage.  Because I'll look over.  If somebody's in that left lane doing 40 and like completely neck and neck with the car  in the middle lane, who is neck and neck with the car in the right lane, and they're doing  this perfect blockade, and there's nothing but clear highway to the horizon.  And I got to get around these people.  The second I get a space enough to go around, as I'm passing, I'll look out the window and  see who's driving in the car that's causing this whole mess. 
[00:27:30]  And I got to tell you, a lot of times, it's exactly who you'd think would be driving.  And it's infuriating.  Yeah.  And in those situations, I will yell things out.  I stick my hand out the window, flip the bird all the time.  I'm like, awful.  But I'm doing it at 80 miles an hour, so they're not going to catch me.  Driving in and out of Manhattan can reduce you to tears.  Yeah.  Literally.  No joke.  I mean, grown men have been known to cry.  Just crying.  Because you just feel so helpless. 
[00:28:00]  Yep.  Like there's traffic, and then there's just a complete meltdown of the roadways to the  point where you're doing all your maneuvers, you're trying alternate ways to get into  Manhattan, nothing works.  And you end up just sitting behind your steering wheel and crying and searching for your chick's  Coldplay CD to have a soundtrack for your tears.  We were driving to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  Me, Kenny, my chick, I was doing that gig.  And there was a meltdown.  Like you said, there was a problem on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. 
[00:28:30]  It shut down.  Yeah.  When they had all that severe ice, so everything was routed onto these little roads.  And the traffic was not moving.  And you get this panic.  Like you want to evacuate somehow.  You want to throw up or you want things to come out of your body.  You're so angry on the other drivers.  You want to cry on other men.  Let the salty tears drip on them and go, just go.  One of the most frustrating moments ever in traffic for me was that when I was living in 
[00:29:00]  Huntington.  Huntington, I think I was married at the time.  I'm not sure of it because of where I was going.  I was leaving my house and I left a little early so I could go have sex with my girlfriend.  So I got jammed up in traffic and I swear to you, tears were coming out of my eyes.  I'm like, if I don't get to have sex with my girlfriend before I have to go to work, I  am going to be livid and this idiot is in my way. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, was I angry?  There's nothing worse than leaving your wife to have sex with your girlfriend and getting  stuck in a traffic jam.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That's not healthy for marriage.  No, no.  It probably isn't.  But it was very frustrating.  I think Ope was in the car one day and couldn't understand why I was so pissed off on the 59th 
[00:30:00]  street bridge.  Do you remember that?  I was pounding the steering wheel going, mother fuck, get the fuck out of my fucking way.  I gotta get the fuck out of here.  Ope walks with these people.  They're not moving.  Get out of my fucking way.  Hey, it's an ongoing theme on this show.  Oh, the power of the pooh.  Oh, yeah.  The power of the pooh.  God damn.  You know, I kind of miss driving with Anthony. 
[00:30:30]  You know, we used to live in Huntington.  Yeah, we were carpooling it.  And we used to carpool.  But I think it's safer that we don't drive anymore.  Yeah.  I really do.  Yeah, probably is.  We used to get into some situations, man.  The best one.  And it goes back to what I was saying about, you know, if someone cuts you off on the highway  and it's some soccer mom in a minivan, you're going to be a raging a-hole.  But if it's someone intimidating, you back down.  It's kind of human nature.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  And I know guys will call up and go, oh, yeah, pooh.  That doesn't happen.  I take on everybody, whoever cuts me off.  I don't care who they are.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Live in your fantasy world.  But remember the time, like, that I hit the guy?  Oh, the crosswalk.  Yeah.  My favorite.  I was being really cocky, and to get out of Manhattan, like, you get people walking  across the street when it's green, like you're supposed to be going.  Green light.  It's one of the most frustrating things. 
[00:31:30]  There's a constant battle going on between pedestrians and motorists here in New York City.  And here's what happens.  When there's a lot of traffic, you'll be stuck at a green light.  The light's green, but across the intersection, you have nowhere to go.  So you have to stop there and wait at the green light.  Now, during this time, since your light is green, the pedestrians have a don't walk sign.  But since they see that traffic isn't moving, they'll start crossing the street.  Now, as they're doing this, traffic then clears on the other side of the intersection.  Now, you have a green light and a bunch of pedestrians in front of you, and you can't move. 
[00:32:00]  This is infuriating.  Right.  I understand sometimes pedestrians can make it through, but how about you look up the line  of traffic, see if it's starting to move.  If it is, stay on your goddamn sidewalk.  Don't walk in front of my vehicle if I have a green light and a clear road, because there's  going to be trouble.  You're at least going to get, and then once you cross in front of me, I will pull next  to you and thank God for the Escalade.  I love it, because the windshield washer will fling liquid to the passenger side, and I will 
[00:32:30]  soak the people as I drive slowly by them.  It is a pisser.  Boy, you're a tough guy.  That's right, as I then go, to get away, because they might hurt me.  Why don't you just jump out and stick a baby on board little sticker on their forehead?  I didn't say I'm not a little faggy for doing that.  I understand, but that was the exact situation.  Yeah, we were in that situation, and it's a green light.  It was time for us to go, and the pedestrian traffic is still in front of us. 
[00:33:00]  So I decide, if I start moving the car forward, it would make people walk a little faster  and maybe scatter them a little bit.  And this guy was just sauntering.  He wasn't even...  If you make an effort, I'll even give that to you.  Like, make an effort.  Realize that I got the green light.  You got the don't walk.  You're in front of my vehicle.  Give a little jog to get out of my way.  Right.  This guy wasn't doing that.  He's sauntering.  Just kind of...  Well, everyone else scattered.  Because I made an aggressive move that I was starting to move forward in. 
[00:33:30]  This one guy, he didn't budge, and he was sauntering.  So I figured it was a good idea to bump him.  To bump him.  And when he says bump him, realize this isn't the car in front of him.  It wasn't another bumper that he's bumping.  It was a human being's leg with his car bumper.  He tapped the guy.  And he got pissed.  He got so pissed.  He walked around to where Ant was sitting in the passenger seat.  And with one punch, took out my side view mirror. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  He just wailed on the side view mirror.  And it just went limp, hanging by the cable that adjusts it.  You know, the side view mirrors, you know, nowadays, that's pretty tough to take out.  Yeah.  Like he did.  He broke the plastic at the base.  Yep.  The big, thick plastic that held all the cables.  Mm-hmm.  With one punch.  What did I do?  Did I jump out of the car and confront this individual?  Because at the time, the car was new, too, by the way. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  It was a nice new car.  I, let me tell you one thing.  I rolled up, I rolled up a fist.  And with all of my might, I slammed down the lock on the door next to me because I did not want him opening up my door.  And I looked at each other like, what a puss.  I couldn't, I just, whoosh, whoosh, lock the door.  Drive, Opie, drive.  Oh, man, you know, I would love to say that was cool, but, man, we couldn't get out of that situation fast enough with my side view just dangling. 
[00:35:00]  And then we yelled at some old ladies to make us feel better later on in the drive.  Yeah, you tell her.  We showed her.  Dude, I was driving, years ago, I was driving with a girlfriend, and this is the worst.  I screamed at somebody, I was, you know, many years ago, and I did something.  But then me and the guy are pulling up into the light, and I hit my lock for the door.  Oh.  But it was power locks, so it all went.  You just hear them all smack down.  Yeah, and my girlfriend goes, oh, my little tough guy. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, there's nothing worse than looking like a pussy.  Oh.  Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk.  Funk, funk, funk.  Oh, they all just smack down.  I had to make it look like it was an accident, and I was going for the window.  Oops.  Oops.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Safe.  And I don't miss driving on the sidewalks anymore with you, all that stuff.  Yeah.  Going backwards down a one-way.  I had to do that.  We were going on the strip club.  That was top priority. 
[00:36:00]  You know, it happens.  You make a wrong turn.  It's a one-way street.  You want to keep your vehicle facing in the direction of the arrow to the one-way, so you  have to drive backwards.  And you don't want to be on there all day, so you got to do it fast.  You got to make your move fast.  And then when a car does happen to come, you want to go on the sidewalk backwards down a  one-way.  That was brilliant.  Black Earl was petrified.  Petrified.  He drove with me once to the strip club, and he was petrified. 
[00:36:30]  Well, he was hanging on to every handle and the dashboard and everything.  Yeah, he was.  Freaking out.  All right.  Anyway.  Good times.  This just hit the news.  All right.  Could it be that Paris' former BFF is pregnant?  Published reports say Nicole Richie was recently spotted with an unusual bump in her belly.  The source tells life in style that she took past me.  Probably a Cheerio.  Oh, man.  We all had it.  We all had it.  You had Cheerio.  What were you going to say?  Because I had garbanzo beans.  Oh, okay. 
[00:37:00]  I was going to say some kind of mint or something.  A mint.  Good.  An Altoid.  I was going to go down that road.  Yeah.  We all had a tiny piece of food.  I was still formulating my tiny piece of food.  That stupid quick anchor.  I knew you guys were going to jump on it.  The source tells life in style that she took a pregnancy test, confirming that she is expecting.  The paparazzi also reportedly snapped a picture of her outside a reproductive clinic.  So far, no comment.  Oh, well, we got her on the show today.  Maybe she'll... 
[00:37:30]  Hey, break that news on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, it's not like...  Oh, never mind.  Come on.  No, I got questions for her.  That's all I got to say.  Yeah.  I got questions.  I'm just amazed that...  The questions people want answers for.  I'm just amazed that she agreed to come on our show.  I'm like, what?  She actually said yes?  Because Roland, he gets us in the office every day and he runs down a list of people for our show. 
[00:38:00]  Like, he's offered George Clooney and Brad Pitt.  Ocean's 13 is coming out.  He's offered all those people and we say yes.  Yeah, of course.  Of course, they say, no way will we go on that show.  But for some reason, she said, yeah, all right, cool.  I'll call those guys today.  Who knows?  Maybe she's a fan.  I'm sure she knows Jim Norton.  Everyone does.  Yeah, I know.  I actually do know her.  Do you?  No. 
[00:38:30]  Will you stop it?  You know I'm lying because I had to put my tongue out and bite on it.  Yeah, you really did.  That was so not convincing.  No, no, I actually do.  Good acting.  Season one got canceled.  Hey, we broke the story yesterday.  What do we know on the Pope Dude?  Pope Dude.  It's on the front page of the Post today here in New York.  He's the head of the Catholic Church.  Jumped.  Come to Papa, lunatic hurls self at Pope.  We broke the story yesterday. 
[00:39:00]  Come to Papa.  Isn't that funny?  He saw the video on TV and passed it along to everybody.  Everyone has seen the video by now.  He jumped out of the crowd in Vatican City.  Actually grabbed onto the back of the Popemobile and was, for lack of any other word, he was  sketching.  He was sketching on the Popemobile for a little while as security just hung on him.  Yeah.  Well, he's got short shorts on, first of all.  Yeah.  I guess he's German and he's just a lunatic.  What's the deal?  Anyone have any more on this?  He just wanted some attention. 
[00:39:30]  I mean, he was not trying to hurt the Pope and that was it.  I mean, it really is a non-story.  He's just a nut who wanted some attention.  And when you look at his face, you just...  Attention for what?  Himself.  I mean, like, there was no real...  So this is exactly what we talk about on the show, where you're sitting at an event  and you get that feeling like, man...  That you want to do something.  I want to do something.  I don't want to kill the person, but I feel like I just need to run on the field and tackle  Joe Torre.  You don't even get the feeling that you want to do it.  It's like this feeling that you can do it.  Right.  You're like, I have the potential right now, if it wasn't for a sane mind, to run out on 
[00:40:00]  the field and just, like, yeah, tackle somebody.  Right.  But you don't do it.  Just to be a goof.  And it gives you an uncomfortable feeling that because of free will, you're actually  able to do this.  But you never would actually do it.  You ever think these crazy thoughts when you're at an event?  Always.  Like we're talking and then you're like, oh my God, I can't believe I'm thinking this.  And then you look around like people, they have to be reading my mind.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Stay calm.  Stay calm.  Just take a sip of your beer.  Everything will be all right.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  All right.  There have been family members of girlfriends that I've been sitting at dinner with and things  like that.  And I've thought, I bet with one punch I could break her jaw and actually thought like I could  lunge over the table and hit her and just shatter her jaw.  And I'm looking at her jaw as she's chewing her food and go, that just, I could smash it.  But then you don't do it because you're sane, you know, and that might put a strain on the 
[00:41:00]  relationship.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  But, you know, it's one of those things where you don't do it.  But crazy guys like this, who the Vatican described this clearly deranged, he did it.  He's like, hey, I could jump right over this and grab onto the Popemobile.  Two seconds later, there he is doing it.  So you probably didn't break any laws, right?  Yes, you probably did.  What?  I don't know.  Endangering the Pope.  I don't know.  The Pope didn't even know what was going on.  No, the Pope was just waving.  It was so, he was oblivious. 
[00:41:30]  Just waving and going about his business as all hell is breaking loose behind the Popemobile.  That's true.  Why didn't the news responsibly turn the cameras away?  Like when a guy runs on the field of a baseball game or something.  Oh, yeah.  That would discourage other people that want to tackle the Pope's car.  And Anthony came up with a really good observation as we're looking at the pictures of what happened at Vatican City.  Jimmy's got a cute butt.  Yeah?  There's one observation.  Yeah, but that was more by touch. 
[00:42:00]  The Swiss Guard.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Come on.  I mean.  What the hell are they doing over there?  Just Google Swiss Guard and you'll know exactly what we're talking about.  But their uniforms are, you don't want to be tackled by the Swiss Guard.  No.  You really don't, man.  You don't even want to play Candyland with that guy.  What a sissy.  There's a picture of the guy getting tackled.  Look, we just had fleet week and we had a whole discussion about how the sailor, the Navy uniforms are...  Not as cool as Marines and the rest of them. 
[00:42:30]  Marines, Army, Air Force, yeah.  But I think the Swiss Guard takes the cake.  Navy uniforms look cool if you're either A, selling ice cream, or B, a homosexual.  I was trying to be polite, but yes, Jimmy.  All right.  That's what we're getting at.  But the Swiss Guard just takes the cake.  The Swiss Guard looks like a court jester.  Right.  It's like this striped orange and blue and yellow stripes with the big puffy arms. 
[00:43:00]  And puffy, like...  And like puffy, old-y time...  Yeah, legs.  Yeah.  It looks like me at the Halloween party dressed in Renaissance gear.  Yeah.  And some kind of like weird beret-looking hat.  Yeah.  And a sword.  He's actually undercover.  Yeah.  He's got a sword.  And he was the one that helped tackle this guy, and it's just like, wow, that's got to  be humiliating.  Yeah.  He'd be tackled by a man who's yodeling.  Yeah.  He yelled, hark, who goes there? 
[00:43:30]  And the other guys have guns.  Yeah.  It's like, why do you need the guy with the sword when you got three guys piled on top  of this guy, all with guns?  The Swiss Guard.  What are they guarding?  What is there over there?  The great part...  Nothing.  As this is happening, there's a photo in the post of it.  As they're tackling him, the Pope doesn't see it.  The driver doesn't see it.  But the guy in the passenger suit is right in front of the Pope, has his right hand in  his jacket, and he's turning around behind him.  Oh, really?  Look at the photo.  He's reaching for a pistol. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  He's reaching for a pistol.  Who is?  The guy right here.  If you can see...  Okay.  You can see he's reaching inside his...  This is all happening in a millisecond.  He hears something behind him, like...  And he's reaching for his pistol and looking behind him.  It's a really cool photo.  So, that one guy was on the ball, at least.  Yeah.  Let's see how did Kerry from Long Island...  But he turned around and yelled at the Pope.  He went, duck's stupid.  I can't see that guy.  Kerry, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I was just calling to say about... 
[00:44:30]  Well, two things about the tickets, but also...  I was so obsessed with getting attention one time at a mic game.  I jumped on Cowbell Man.  Who?  You know Cowbell Man?  Wow.  Um...  Yeah, I do.  You do?  Mm-hmm.  Who's that?  He's a man and he has his cowbell.  Oh, that guy.  Why did you say something?  And it kind of rings and stuff to get everyone, like, psyched.  What'd you do?  Tell us.  Yeah.  To get everyone excited about the game. 
[00:45:00]  And I just had that feeling, like, where I could not sit down and just watch it anymore.  I just had to get attention for myself.  So you jumped on top of Cowbell Man?  I did, and I made out of Cowbell Man.  And I was with my boyfriend and all of his family, and I was, you know, you're tailgating  for hours in the parking lot.  You don't even know what's going on.  You're crazy.  You were drunk.  Oh, yeah.  So what happened with your relationship?  Um, I'm fathered, basically, but...  You ever see that picture on the web of the girl on the beach doing the cartwheel? 
[00:45:30]  And it says, attention whore.  That's you.  I love that one.  I'm an attention whore.  Hey, we all get those urges, but most of us, just about every one of us, we don't act  on it.  The worst is in church or at a funeral.  It's like these awful things that you're like, oh, God.  How, like, how effed up would it be to just, like, kick the coffin in the hole and just  let it fall in there?  You just think these awful thoughts. 
[00:46:00]  You just never do them.  What is Bill Burr's?  When he sees, like, muffins at bake sales, he wants to just punch all the muffins.  He wants to punch the muffins and just flatten them all.  Yeah, he did a whole thing about that on our show.  He gets the urge.  He just wants to punch all the muffins as he's walking at a street fair or something.  All right, Carrie, so you jumped on Cowbell Man.  Terrific.  Yeah, I jumped on Cowbell Man.  All right.  Anything else?  Not my proudest moment.  And I was going to say about the traffic, the other, that you talked about before, 
[00:46:30]  I commute back and forth from Long Island to Jersey for school.  And have you ever been in such a traffic jam?  By the time you get up to see who it is, it's like this horrible accident and all you  can say is to yourself, like, how rude could you possibly be?  You're looking at people, they're being carried off in stretchers, and you're just, like,  cursing them out in your head.  Like, you cannot think anything.  I've said it before, yeah.  I've said, like, someone better be dead.  Someone had better be dead.  There better be copters in the middle of this street because I'm being inconvenienced.  How about this one? 
[00:47:00]  You're in a massive traffic jam.  You finally get to the problem, and it's a car that is broken down, and you're sitting  there like, you have no business driving this car around.  And of course it was going to break down and F up our afternoon.  I also don't understand how people just, their car dies in the middle lane.  Like, I can understand if you're in traffic and it overheats or something, but there are  times where in front of the traffic jam, traffic's moving perfectly.  So you know there wasn't a traffic jam before this guy stalled. 
[00:47:30]  And meanwhile, his car stalled.  And was he sitting there as he was drifting to a stop going, what do I do?  Just stay here in the middle lane and hope for the best?  How about getting off the road?  They can never get off the road.  And then the fender bender is another one.  People think that if you bump into another car and get into a fender bender, that CSI  is going to come to the scene with tweezers and fingerprint kits.  Don't touch the cars. 
[00:48:00]  Leave them as they are.  We're going to measure skid marks.  We're going to take photographs.  They're not.  Get your goddamn cars off the road.  They think you've got to leave them there because it's like leaving the scene of an accident  or moving evidence.  It's not.  If both your cars can move, move them.  That's my public service message for the day.  But no one's going to listen to it.  No, because they're stupid.  All right, Carrie, anything else?  No, I would love to go to the traveling virus on Long Island.  I heard you guys were giving away tickets. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  Yeah, why don't you go buy them?  Oh, that wasn't very pleasant.  But we could have probably given her a ticket or two.  Yeah.  Just buy them.  Actually, a nice thank you to the New York fans.  We're doing something special for the ONA Travel and Virus Comedy Tour tomorrow.  Oh.  A little ticket special tomorrow.  Nice.  All right.  But it's just a little thank you for the June 16th show at Jones Beach.  Brought to you by Bud Light. 
[00:49:00]  Always worth it.  We'll have that announcement tomorrow, okay?  Really fast, we'll go to Dan on Long Island.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'm glad to hear there's a couple other sickos out there.  I always thought I was really twisted because even as a little kid, I just wanted to scream  any sort of profanity right during the sermon or something.  You know, tell the priest to shut the hell up.  Or even at a funeral, you know, like, this guy was an a-hole, you know?  See, I love this radio show because I've had these thoughts that I thought I was crazy.  And then you realize just about everyone has these just crazy thoughts that jump in your 
[00:49:30]  head, but you don't act on it.  Yep.  At Family Functions, I'm not even going to say, like, who or what, but I was at a family  event, and all I wanted to do was yell at one of my relatives the C word.  Like, it would have been so inappropriately awful and horrible, and I had no problem with  the person, not a problem at all, but it was just like, I was thinking, imagine the  commotion it would cause if I just walked up and started screaming, you, C?  Who? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, who was it?  Oh, I can't say.  Come on.  Oh, no, it's awful.  Are they?  It's terrible.  No, not at all.  That's why.  If they were, it would be, I probably would have yelled it out.  I don't care.  But it was, but she's not.  It's just one of those things where it was, you know, one of those inappropriate.  She is a little bit, right?  Hmm?  No, not at all.  Yeah, a little bit.  No, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  She's in the home.  Stop.  Talked about her yesterday.  Did I say yesterday again for the announcement?  No, no.  Stephen S. from Bayshore just beating me up today?  Of course, Stephen.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  Of course, Steve from Bayshore.  We'll have a little announcement, a little thank you to the fans tomorrow.  The New York fans, anyway.  And maybe we'll try to do some other things for the fans across America.  Patrice and I were talking one time in the car.  We used to talk a lot in the car in Jersey City, like two fruity lovers.  I would drop them off.  And he came up with a great bit for it, which really annoyed me that he came up with such  a brilliant bit.  It was for intrusive thinking, where he talked about wanting to spike a baby.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And it's these crazy thoughts that just hit you. 
[00:51:00]  And that's the difference, I think, between us and people with Tourette's, is that they  say things.  And us and that guy, is that he does them.  That's all it is.  Everyone has them.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you do.  You have these awful thoughts of what...  God, what would people around think if I just did this awful, horrible thing?  People with Tourette's will say racist stuff in front of black people.  And it's almost like it's not because you want to be a racist.  It's just because your mind says, like, the most awful thing that just comes out of your mouth.  It can't control.  That's the difference between us and them.  Because everyone gets these sickening impulses.  But all of a sudden, they're going, ah, I've got to say Nichols. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Or lose my teeth.  All right.  The phones are lit.  We'll go to you guys next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  92.  What did I miss?  Ah, damn.  Was it a doozy?  Well, because of something that's being worked on.  Yeah.  I was just saying to... 
[00:52:00]  No, we're going to talk about that right now.  Oh, okay.  I was just saying to Jimmy that...  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, by the way.  Right.  That a father-son, like, sex thing...  Yeah.  ...is pretty creepy.  And then Jimmy said, especially if there's no one else involved.  Because I was talking about, you know, kind of a threesome there with a father-son and then a woman.  I don't know if it's a threesome, though.  They get their own.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I was saying, like, with a threesome, though, it would be really creepy.  And Jimmy brought up the fact that perhaps the woman isn't even involved. 
[00:52:30]  And that really got creepy.  Look, here's the deal.  We all know Father's Day right around the corner.  Yes.  We want to get your father a whore for Father's Day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Whore for Father's Day.  It's called self-editing.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Wow.  You're getting good at that, Jimmy.  Yeah, because I was going to say...  I'd love to help you, Dad. 
[00:53:00]  But you did a good job on your own.  I can't say that because that would imply...  Right.  No, I think we're educated enough with this radio show.  We know there's a lot of fathers out there that are just completely miserable.  Miserable?  You're miserable.  They're not getting what they need.  Going through an ugly divorce, or maybe you've been married 20, 25 years, and you haven't  had sex in a decade.  Mm-hmm.  We want sons to call up.  Maybe even daughters to call up. 
[00:53:30]  Ew.  We're looking for, like, a father that desperately needs a hooker.  Uh-oh.  What is Tom doing?  Oh, he's yelling at Steve.  Oh, no.  Oh, this isn't going to be good.  Poor Steve.  What have you done to me?  I'm in trouble.  No, no, no.  What they're trying to do is...  See what they're saying here.  Right now, Steve's hands are upside down, and he's got his A3 rings on, and he's trying  to explain, like, man-to-man. 
[00:54:00]  No, no, no.  You see...  Yes.  Oh, okay.  No, no.  Okay, okay.  Here's how that's going right now.  Be right, be right, be right, be right.  Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.  And then I'll come in...  Ah, guys, we'll talk about this after the show, but there's trouble.  Trouble in paradise.  Or maybe Tom is showing Steve an empty honey jar and scolding him.  Was it our wording, maybe?  Ah, probably.  Really?  Yeah.  What happened?  Bingo.  What, it was the wording? 
[00:54:30]  What's wrong with the wording?  Nothing.  We're all adults here.  Let's just, uh...  We didn't say anything.  Ah, well, there was a problem with the wording.  The problem with the wording, exactly.  Yes.  Uh, we're giving away a date.  A trip to the...  Did you already say where it's going?  I didn't hear.  No, we haven't gotten to that point.  Okay.  We're giving away a date.  And you can say where this date will take place, but you can't use the words that are  used.  Okay.  Okay?  Because that was just...  He was just kidding, anyway.  I mean, the real point is that...  Wow, lawyers just know how to take all the fun out of everything. 
[00:55:00]  It's just like a big balloon going around the room going...  Oh, they just stink.  And then plops on the floor.  All right.  Wink, wink.  No winking.  What?  No winking.  I like to wink.  Here's what is going on.  We want to take a father.  Yeah.  And get him a date.  Perhaps he is lonely. 
[00:55:30]  Perhaps he is widowed, divorced, or is not in a good relationship or a good place in his  marriage.  Yeah.  And the children know this best, don't they?  They're around it.  They see it.  They understand the pain and suffering that dad is feeling.  Father's Day is coming up.  What are you going to do?  A tie?  Stop it.  Get him a date with a lovely lady.  A lovely lady.  That's what we're talking about, Opie.  And where do these ladies come from?  Steve? 
[00:56:00]  Hopefully Newark.  Broken homes?  Well, who's supplying the lady for the date?  Oh, the wonderful Moonlight Bunny Ranch and Mr. Dennis Hough.  Exactly.  Wonderful.  Yes, exactly.  So it's dating.  Yes, exactly.  We're hooking up a father.  We're dating is legal.  Right.  We want to hook up a father and a woman from the Bunny Ranch to go out on a date and perhaps 
[00:56:30]  some stimulating conversation over some cocktails that the husband hasn't had in years because  he's, like I said, widowed or divorced or something.  Perhaps, perhaps if they hit it off, who knows?  Maybe marriage in the future.  Yeah.  And now I'm going to see I'm going from conversation at a table on the first date to marriage.  Right.  But it could be the gamut of anything in between.  So we're looking for miserable fathers out there?  Yeah.  This is the ultimate Father's Day gift.  Yeah.  Screw the ties.  Hey, if they want to let them. 
[00:57:00]  But, you know, who are we to say?  A date.  Oh, my.  We all know the date means ****.  We know.  Means what?  ****.  Yeah.  And if the two of them are out to dinner and decide after dinner they want to **** until  **** all over ****, it doesn't matter.  But it's a date.  It's a date. 
[00:57:30]  Dennis Hoff is supplying the date or dates because we're thinking of maybe doing a father-son thing.  Yeah.  Like if, you know, the son calls up.  Or maybe, well, the daughter would be weird.  But it's a possibility.  It would be a little weird.  You don't know.  Maybe Dick Cheney will get a date.  Well, for Father's Day we...  She can enjoy the funny ranch.  Yeah.  For Father's Day we definitely want to get the father a date.  And possibly...  ****.  Yeah.  And possibly the son...  Yeah.  A date.  A date. 
[00:58:00]  ****.  Yeah.  Hey, Dad, did you...  **** your date?  Yes, son.  I...  **** my date, right?  ****.  And then I...  In her...  With a...  And took a...  And put it...  What'd you do, son?  Well, Dad, I...  Right in the...  Over her...  And then I...  But she took my...  And then we...  All night long.  Sounds like a lovely date.  It's a date.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  So...  That's what we're doing for Father's Day.  Yeah.  Because our fathers are dead.  Yeah.  We're from the Dead Fathers Club.  Yeah.  We ought to make a club.  Hey, who else has a dead dad?  Come on, everyone.  Who...  Who else's dad is dead?  Come on!  Anyone?  Oh.  Uh...  No?  No?  What?  Are we the only ones?  Any dead dads?  No?  Aunt and I are the only ones, huh?  Travis, is your dad dead? 
[00:59:00]  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's...  Oh, he's gonna...  He's gonna take it tough.  Oh, boy.  Any fathers on the waiting list?  Let me just...  Anyone with a foot in the grave  and one on a skateboard?  Let me just put it this way  for this upcoming Father's Day.  You're all gonna have to deal with it someday.  Enjoy.  Look at Travis.  Not me, because there's no kryptonite around.  Oh! 
[00:59:30]  Unless you're lucky and, you know,  you go first.  See, we gotta acknowledge  Father's Day is a sad day  for a lot of people.  Yeah.  I didn't realize that  until I took my little trip  on Father's Day  and saw, like, the traffic jam  getting into the old cemetery.  The old cemetery.  That's what you do on Father's Day.  Roll into the old cemetery  to look at a cold stone.  That's just like  getting your dad  a fine date.  See, this is what we do.  This is what we do now.  That's horrible. 
[01:00:00]  I, uh,  to commemorate Father's Day  every year  for,  I can't even remember  when,  I take a plate of spaghetti  and heave it against the wall  in memory of my daddy.  And then I yell at my mother  and call her  the C-word.  Casper from  Casper from Chicago  Dead Fathers Club  cardholder number three.  All right.  Checking in.  Dead Dad's Club.  Oh, man.  My dad was the greatest, too.  Oh, they all are  when they're alive. 
[01:00:30]  It sucks.  I gotta acknowledge that.  It just sucks.  Yeah.  But anyway,  we're doing the right thing  for Father's Day.  Yeah, see?  We're stepping up.  We're looking for  miserable fathers  and, uh,  at least one  will be going out  to the Bunny Ranch  out there in Nevada  for their date.  And possibly the son  will go along  and have a separate date  as well.  They can't have  a date with the same girl?  Hell,  if they want to have  the same date  with the same girl?  Wouldn't that be cute?  Whatever, man.  Hey, Dad, move your... 
[01:01:00]  This is just like  throwing the baseball  around in the backyard, huh?  Huh, son?  You realize,  you don't realize  for a half hour  the girl went  to the bathroom?  Wait a minute.  What?  I just got greedy.  Oh, did you?  It is kind of like  throwing the ball  around the yard  because, you know,  if you move your mitt  you're going to hit the face.  Come on now, son.  He's giving you pointers  like, yeah,  when you're out back. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Throwing around  the football.  We're not sure  if we're going  for miserable stories  or maybe some kind  of in-studio competition,  but we're going to try  to give this away  a week from tomorrow, right?  Yep.  The Opie & Anthony Show  looking for fathers  and sons to possibly  compete for their chance  to win a trip  to the Moonlight Bunny Ranch.  I guess you are competing  technically.  Mm-hmm.  And we're going to talk  to Dennis Hoff  on Monday  about the competition  and this will be  given away  by next Friday.  What a great  Father's Day gift.  Could you email?  We're so goddamn giving.  Well, all the radio stations 
[01:02:00]  doing just hacky stuff.  We figured we'd just,  you know,  hit it out of the ballpark.  Right.  Email Travis  at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  music.com.  Mm-hmm.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  foundrymusic.com.  Travis at foundrymusic.com.  Let's say hi to Will  in the Bronx.  Will, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey.  Yo, my father's  divorced three times.  He has five kids.  He's a single father.  He has to make breakfast  for all his kids  in the morning,  send him to school, 
[01:02:30]  get to work,  make money,  come back,  pay the mortgage.  He's miserable.  Yo, he really needs  some...  There you go.  He's utilizing  his phone buttons.  They're all using  their feet.  Wow.  Dude, when was the last  time he went out  on a date?  Wow.  Well,  my stepmother,  my ex-stepmother anyway,  was like  ten years younger than me.  So he really,  you know,  he got a good one.  Ten years younger than you.  How old are you?  I mean,  ten years older than me.  Oh, I was going to say... 
[01:03:00]  I'm 24.  She's 34.  Oh, wow.  14.  That would have been something.  Boy, we got another  present for dad.  Yeah, he might not  like that one.  I mean,  when I was 16,  he was teaching his girl  how to drive,  you know?  Yeah.  Nah, but  he's miserable, man.  He needs me, yo.  Wow,  that does sound  pretty sorry.  All right,  well,  how are we going to do this?  Are we going to have people  to email Travis  with their stories?  Yeah.  We should take his info.  Yeah, we should take his info.  He seems like a good candidate. 
[01:03:30]  We'll take your info.  And your dad would  go for this in a second?  Oh, yeah.  And I need it, too.  Shit,  I'm like 255.  I need it.  Oh, you need it, too, huh?  All right,  well,  we could do a father-son  combo with you, too.  Possibly, yes.  You know,  we got a week  to figure this out,  so, I mean,  you know,  this is the first phone call  and it's pretty good.  It's pretty good.  All right, cool.  Don't hang up, dude,  because Travis is going to  take your info, okay?  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on, Will.  I mean,  we want to get really twisted  and maybe get a father  that's, you know, 
[01:04:00]  still involved.  That's just as miserable,  but maybe there's someone  still in the picture.  You never know, though.  Maybe, you know,  maybe the other person  just doesn't give a crap  and will allow this.  Won't even care.  Whatever.  Or maybe we do it  on the old QT.  Yeah, keep it on the DL.  Right.  Let's go to Bear in New York.  Bear, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  Hi.  I'm the perfect candidate, fellas.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  I'm a paramedic  with the New York City  Fire Department.  Okay.  Well, you could at least  cop a feel anytime you want.  What's that?  Teasing, of course, sir.  I got four kids,  four daughters.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  I'm with the same woman  20,  almost 22 years.  I got four daughters.  The oldest is 17.  I got my twins that are 12.  When my twins were conceived,  that's the last time  I had sex with my wife. 
[01:05:00]  And how long?  12 years it's been.  You haven't had...  Wait, you're still married  and you haven't had sex  in 12 years?  That's right.  And believe me,  I want to bail,  but I won't bail on my kids.  You know what I'm saying?  See, a lot of guys  stay in it for the kids.  So how are you going  to work this out?  That's why I'm calling you.  No, I understand  that part about...  I mean, you know,  you're a prime candidate.  Yep.  But what are you going  to tell your wife?  What would you say?  Like, you're going  on a business?  I don't think my wife  would care. 
[01:05:30]  My wife...  See, this is what  I'm looking for.  I really think  there's a guy out there  where the wife will go,  yeah, I don't care.  Go have fun.  I honestly...  And you know what?  I would go out  and spend the 200  an hour for the hooker,  but then I'm taking  the money out  from my kids.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  Well, it's for a date.  It's a date, sir.  Hey, can we...  It's just a date.  Hey, can we call  your wife to see  if she's into this  or what?  Can we call your wife  to see if she's into this?  Sure.  Are you serious?  I'm dead.  She wouldn't care. 
[01:06:00]  Believe me.  All right.  Wow.  We'll get you  and your wife  on the line.  I want to talk  to both of you.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry about...  Sorry.  Yeah, don't curse.  Don't curse.  I know.  Sorry.  Yeah, he cursed.  So basically,  I said we want to get  this guy and his wife  on the phone  and talk to them  after the break.  Hold on, Bear.  All right.  If she doesn't care,  I think we might  have a winner.  Yeah, Jesus.  That's pretty twisted.  That poor guy.  Let's go to Kerry  on Long Island.  Kerry, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hi. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, who are you?  Hey, I called back  to be verbally abused.  Oh, you're Kerry  from Long Island.  Yeah, that's why  I'm calling back.  And you wanted  the tickets  to the virus show  at Jones Beach.  Yeah, I would.  Wow.  I'm basically  your biggest fan.  I know that's so  cliche, but...  All right.  Listen, listen, Kerry.  If you're our biggest fan,  what is the...  What is the...  Your favorite  Opie and Anthony bit,  I guess.  We'll start there.  My favorite... 
[01:07:00]  Tune in tomorrow  for the announcement  of a ticket special  for the Jones Beach show.  Brought to you by  Bud Light.  Always worth it.  A little thank you  to the New York fans.  If she was the biggest fan,  she'd have known  that was coming.  Yeah, yeah.  What's your favorite bit?  When you hang up...  Yeah.  Let's go to Scott in Boston.  Scott.  Hey, where's Scott going?  You just wanted to say  that he's part of  the Dead Dad Club.  Ah, welcome.  I was thinking about  the Dead Dad Club yesterday  because, you know,  all the window displays 
[01:07:30]  has all the stuff  you can buy for your daddy.  Yeah.  And it made me sad.  Oh!  It made me really sad.  It's still too new for you, Will.  This is Greg Hughes,  the actor that plays  Opie and Anthony show.  And I was very sad yesterday.  Yeah.  They showed polo shirts  and golf clubs  and all sorts of things  for Dad.  Jesus.  And I'm like,  it's a tough time  for people out there.  Yeah.  Not everyone is happy  that Father's Day  is around the corner.  I felt that way.  I was driving past  the liquor store. 
[01:08:00]  And I was like,  oh, Daddy,  I miss you.  Wow.  Let's go to Rob  on Long Island.  Rob!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I saw a gay guy  walking down the street  and I missed my father  because I remember  how he used to think  I was going to turn out gay  because I cried so much  and he berated me for it.  So I was like,  oh, I miss you, Daddy.  Did you try to give him  a cute little present  for Father's Day  and he yelled at you  because it was too cute?  No, I don't remember  getting him anything 
[01:08:30]  for Father's Day.  I remember us going out  and shopping for Mother's Day  all the time  and getting Mommy  some Chanel No. 5 perfume  or something.  But for Dad, I don't...  I'm sure she hasn't worn that  in about 25 years, huh?  Yeah, definitely not.  But I think for Father's Day,  though, it was usually  Mom just saying,  that f*** sucker  can get his own clothes.  So, it was really...  By the way,  this whole getting Dad  a date for Father's Day, 
[01:09:00]  you know, Anthony,  his father back in the day  used to get him dates.  Yes, yes, a date.  He got me a date.  I believe it was  on my 13th birthday.  13th birthday,  Aunt's father got him a date.  Got me a date.  So this is kind of  a nice little twist  on that whole thing, right?  My date was waiting upstairs  in one of the bedrooms.  of our apartment  when I got out of the shower.  That's where our date started. 
[01:09:30]  I didn't even have time  to pin the corsage on her.  Well, you pin something else on her.  That's me doing an elbow to the mic.  It's my new bit.  When I got a doozy,  I'll just go,  huh, huh, huh?  Her name was Buzz.  Yeah.  Her name was Buzz.  You might as well have been a guy.  No.  No.  She was a big boned gal.  She wasn't fat,  but she was just like big.  She was like an Amazon woman.  Yeah.  But just a giant set of, 
[01:10:00]  like the commercial.  You know, yeah, very big.  And I remember walking into the room  looking and she was just sitting there  with the pillows propped up behind her  and the sheet was around her waist.  So her top part was completely nude.  And I just walked in and went,  hamna, hamna, hamna, hamna.  It's my first, like, view.  Hey, by the way,  Matt from Cape Cod,  we don't want to lose him.  We're just,  we're just blowing up in Cape Cod,  aren't we, Matt?  Yeah.  My God.  Hey, hey, how you doing? 
[01:10:30]  What's up, Matt?  Not too much.  I called my girlfriend  when I heard you guys  wanted to give away that prize.  Yeah.  From my wife.  And I mentioned it to her  and she said the only way  she'd allow me to win it  is if she was allowed  to tag along with me.  Whoa.  A husband and wife.  Wait, she wants to tag along?  On your date?  On your date to the Bunny Ranch?  Oh, she wants to join in.  Oh, wow.  See, we're getting  some good stories already.  Hmm.  All right, hold on a line there, Matt.  We got to take a break.  We'll take more stories 
[01:11:00]  from the sons and the fathers,  but basically we're getting  Dad a date for Father's Day  at the Bunny Ranch  out in Nevada.  All right, more of your stories  and also Chuck Liddell on the way  and Nicole Ritchie  and Brian Regan.  Very, very busy morning here  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rod.  We got a busy morning today. 
[01:11:30]  Phones are lit.  We got Chuck Liddell coming in.  Brian Regan in a few minutes.  Phone call from Nicole Ritchie.  Want to talk to us?  877-212-5762.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you know,  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Swingers should be disqualified.  He's writing that  on the answer feedback  and I completely agree.  Right, disqualified.  We're talking about  our Father's Day giveaway. 
[01:12:00]  Right?  Yep.  You want to explain that  once again, Anthony?  Well.  Because you know how to  follow the Tom rules.  I have a tough time  following the Tom rules.  A Father's Day  right around the corner  and we want to do  something special  for a dad out there  that maybe is a widowed  or perhaps divorced.  Or perhaps still married  and just is in  kind of a lousy,  long, tiring relationship.  Well, we just talked to Bear.  We're trying to get him  on the phone  to talk to his wife.  But basically, 
[01:12:30]  he's still married  and he hasn't had sex since  or he hasn't had a date.  Hasn't had relations  with his wife  since the twins were born  12 years ago.  12 years ago.  Still married.  And he thinks  she could care less  that he goes  to the Bunny Ranch  in Nevada.  Yeah.  For a date.  Well, yeah,  because he would need  maybe the company  of another woman  to sit and maybe  talk about some  of his problems  that he's having  with his wife.  That'd be nice,  wouldn't it?  You get the,  you know,  the ear of a woman 
[01:13:00]  to talk to.  That's lovely.  A date.  So we're looking  to find a guy  preferably through his son.  Let's say the son  calls up and goes,  yeah, my father,  this poor son of a bitch  is just a mess.  And then we'll send them  out to the Bunny Ranch.  Yeah.  Where they can go out  on a date.  And now if you know  anything about the Bunny Ranch  or if you've seen  the TV show  on HBO,  I believe, right?  Yeah.  It's...  Cat House.  Yeah.  Cat House. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  The girls there,  lovely.  We've had a few girls  on the show.  They're lovely at dating.  Actually,  two of them  were on a date  with Big A  in our studios.  Wow, yeah.  And wow,  what a date.  That was good.  I never knew  you could do so much  with a toothbrush.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  Well,  because Big A  has bad breath.  Wink, wink.  They must have went  to a date  at the Slaughterhouse  because that's what  the girl's hands  smelled like  when she was done. 
[01:14:00]  Well,  that was the girl  that ended up  We just talked  about this recently.  She ran into  the bathroom crying.  Crying.  Yes.  Do you understand  what she does  for a living?  She goes out  on dates with guys.  And we got her  to cry?  Yeah.  She was crying  and her biggest  complaint was  that she couldn't  get a certain aroma  off her hands  no matter how much  she washed them.  From poor Big A.  Yeah.  Her hand was  a weird color too. 
[01:14:30]  Let's not forget.  But that was good.  That was a fun  date for Big A.  And now we're  looking to get  a date for one  of these poor dads.  And possibly  we're open to  the possibility  that we send  the son as well  or the daughter.  Maybe we get  a daughter.  Who knows?  But so far  the stories have  been really,  really good.  Let's say hi  to Steve in  Massachusetts  listening on  WBCN.  What's up,  Steve?  Hi.  How are you?  Hey, did the show  just start on  WBCN?  The delay is a  little long. 
[01:15:00]  We're hearing  rumors that as  the show goes on  the delay gets  longer in Boston.  He's actually  hearing us leave  yesterday's show  right now.  And that scares  the crap out of me  because that makes  me think what  are they doing?  What are they  throwing in the  middle of the show  where the delay  has to get longer?  Because we already,  whatever, we have  too much clutter  as it is with  this radio show.  We don't need  longer delays.  That scares me.  But anyway.  We call it  material, Opie.  Not clutter.  Well, no.  See, that was  self-deprecating.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Go ahead, Steve. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, I want to  get my dad into  this contest,  you guys.  I haven't.  Yeah, what's  his story?  He, uh, my  mother left him  when I was like  12 years old,  you know?  And he ended  up having to  move back in  with his mother.  Ooh.  And he's been  there ever since.  He still lives  with him.  He's been there  ever since.  And he hasn't  been with a woman  since my mother  left him.  And how  long ago was  that?  My father hasn't  had sex in  over 20 years. 
[01:16:00]  20 years?  No lie.  He's doing  something.  How do you  know?  Yeah.  How do I  know?  Believe me,  I know my  dad.  Yeah.  And he's been  living with his  mom since.  He takes care of  his mother every  day.  Maybe, uh...  He's got me and  my brother and  my sister.  He's spent all  his time with us.  Never ever got  involved with another  woman.  And what does  he do for a  living?  He's a mechanic.  Would he be up  for a date in  Nevada?  I'm sure he'd be 
[01:16:30]  up for a date in  Nevada.  At the Buddy  Ranch.  Dude, what's  like wrong with  him that he's  still with his  mom and isn't  out there on the  scene trying to  get dates?  Oh, well, he  spent all his  time with his  kids, you know,  and had to pay  some of his  child support, had  to move back in  with his mom, and  now she's so old  he can't leave  her alone.  Is she  infirmed?  I'm infirmed.  So he's stuck  there taking care  of dear old 
[01:17:00]  mom, and he  doesn't have a  life of his own?  God, he's  wasting his life  away.  And he goes  home and takes  care of mom.  Hey, by the  way, Stephen  S. from Bayshore,  hey, Ope, can  you ask this guy  what a quantest  is?  Oh, my God,  it's a quantest  for a date.  A quantest.  Yeah.  Well, all right,  we're going to  get your info,  Steve, and he  would go for  this, you  think, huh?  See, we want  to talk to a  few fathers  today.  He really  needs it. 
[01:17:30]  The stories  are coming in.  We want to  get a few of  the fathers  on the phone.  He sounds  like a sad  sack.  Yeah, all  right, hold  on the line.  We got some  great stories  coming in  already.  Rob on  Long Island,  what's up?  What's going  on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, yeah,  I'm 23, my  father's 51,  out here on  Long Island, and  he's a pizza  delivery guy in  does is tell  me about,  like, any  girl that he  can get is  online, and  they're a beast.  They're usually  like, you  know, 250  pounds or  heavier. 
[01:18:00]  But yet, he  likes to brag  and tell me  these stories.  Like, I want  to hear, you  know, I want  to hear the  date he had  the night before.  I'm sure they  all start with,  so I'm delivering  this pizza.  You know what?  This monster  opens the door.  Rob, I hate  to tell you, but  your dad's doing  all right.  Yeah, even if  he's a chubby  chaser, I  mean, he's  still dating.  At least he's  dating.  We're talking  about fathers  that they're  not doing  anything.  They're dreaming  of getting a  mess into their 
[01:18:30]  bed or a  mess on a  date.  What's that?  What?  No, I said I  don't think he's  got anything in  about a year  right now, but  yeah, believe me,  I know as far  as my story goes  compared to these  other ones, it  wasn't going to  really compare.  I'm sorry.  The pizza delivery  thing's pretty sad,  though.  I'll give you that.  Yeah, let's go to  Philly.  It's kind of hard  to have a girl  sleep with you  when you show  up handing her  a box with a  little chubby  Italian on it,  like with one  foot raised and  like tiptoeing  with one.  And he's doing  that thing with 
[01:19:00]  his fingers on  the box.  Got his big  chef hat on.  Let's go to  Philly.  It's Bob  listening on  WYSP.  What's up,  Bob?  How you doing,  fellas?  Hey.  Bob, my parents  got divorced about  22 years ago.  My mother cheated  on my father,  left them.  He got depressed  for about two  years.  Met a woman  that was like  his soulmate.  She was a great  person.  Here he gets  kicked in a bull.  She runs up  getting a brain  tumor,  dies of cancer.  about six years 
[01:19:30]  ago.  And at the same  time, I catch my  wife cheating on  me.  So I moved in  with my father.  He's in a deep  ass depression.  Don't go out of  the house.  Don't do nothing.  I catch him crying  like a baby when I  come home.  Oh, no.  Here's the kick  of the balls.  My ex-wife that I  caught cheating on 
[01:20:00]  me is leaving for  Las Vegas at  8.05 on a plane  with the guy I  caught cheating on  me with, who's  married.  She's like a  goomod to the  guy.  Wow.  My father hasn't  had sex since  his soulmate,  Judy, her name  was, passed  away six and a  half years ago.  Judy?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's pretty bad.  Horrible.  I say this guy's  a very good  candidate.  We just laugh at  the name Judy,  that's all.  Judy's a funny  man.  Yes.  I'm sorry. 
[01:20:30]  This guy sounds  like a good  candidate, man.  You sound like  a really good  candidate, Bob.  He sits in the  house and does  nothing for the  last six and a  half years.  Both of these  guys have had  their...  He's on disability  to top it off.  Is he?  Why?  What's wrong  with him?  He's got ten  screws in his  neck and two  bars.  You've got to  have all his  vertebrae cut.  How did that  happen?  He was pulling 
[01:21:00]  down a chain  behind there  on the back  of his tractor  trailer and his  neck collapsed  and crushed  all his  vertebrae.  Oh, my God.  People are  commenting on  Pal Talk.  They're calling  him Frank and  Loser.  But anyway,  this kick in the  balls is so ironic  that my ex-wife is  leaving on a plane  with a guy I caught  cheating on me with  six years ago at  8.05 in the  morning.  They're leaving.  Wouldn't it be  ironic if you guys 
[01:21:30]  go out to Vegas and  you win the date and  you walk in and  there's your ex-wife?  And your ex-mom  working there at  the Bunny Ranch?  She left my  father for a cop.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  You know what?  You're a great  candidate.  Hold on, Bob.  I would love to  give this to  somebody listening  on WISP, by the  way.  He sounds, yeah,  that sounds like a  great story.  They're both in  some bad sorts.  All right.  Let's go to  Johnny in the  Bronx.  This is getting  downright depressing. 
[01:22:00]  Johnny, what's up?  Hey there, guys.  Hey there, Jenny.  All right.  I believe my  father should be  involved in this  contest.  Mm-hmm.  After my mother  left him, two  months later, got  hit by a train.  Hasn't been  right in the head  ever since.  So your father, his  wife leaves him, and  then he got hit by  a train?  Yeah.  Or it wasn't like a  suicide attempt, was  it?  No, actually, no.  He was jumped, and  actually it was an 
[01:22:30]  attempted murder.  Somebody pushed  him?  Yeah, they set him  up.  Knocked him unconscious  and set him up on  the train track.  You're kidding, right?  No, I'm dead  serious.  Then how did he  survive that?  It actually hit him  in his butt top.  He got hit in the  ass by a train?  Yep.  What was it, being  pushed by someone?  How is he alive?  Really?  Are you sure it just  wasn't?  Yeah, uh-oh.  Maybe that's what he  told you.  Yeah, it was just a 
[01:23:00]  guy with, a guy, it  was just a guy named  Lionel.  All right.  Too creepy,  Johnny.  I think we're going  to have to pass on  you.  Hold on, I think  we should, this guy's  a candidate.  Yeah, he might be,  All right, hold  on, we'll take your  story to the lab and  see how it computes.  Might be fun to  talk to.  Yeah.  All right, hold  on, hold on.  All right, let's go  to Paul and PA.  Paul, what's up?  My dad got divorced  from my mom 10 years  ago. 
[01:23:30]  My mom is insane,  completely insane,  and she's in trouble  now and she wants to  come crawling back to  my dad and I, I am  so afraid my dad's  going to take her  back.  Uh-huh.  So you figure if he  goes out on a date  that he'll, he won't  think about her like  that and kind of get  over it?  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, my mom, my mom  is insane beyond  imagining and I, I just 
[01:24:00]  want my dad to get  over her.  Mm-hmm.  Well, your mom sounds  like a, a real, uh,  treat.  What do you think your  dad would go through  with it, mister?  Uh, my, my dad, my  dad would, I'd have to  convince him.  I mean, I, he, he  would, he, he doesn't  want to do this.  He wouldn't want to do  this, but I have to  convince him, but I,  I, I have, I'm very  afraid he's going to,  my mom's going to come  back and my, I, I, I 
[01:24:30]  hate this guy.  First of all, he sounds  like he's making it up.  Yeah, I don't know.  A little, you're, I'm  out.  It sounds like he's,  he's acting.  I just tapped out.  I'm out on that one.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mike in  New Hampshire.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how's it going,  guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I, uh, think I'm a  pretty good candidate.  I'm a Hurricane Katrina  victim.  Yeah.  The damage to my house  was assessed at 60  grand.  The insurance company  caught me a check with  30 grand.  Oh, how nice.  Right after I got most  of it fixed, it caught  on fire.  Sorry. 
[01:25:00]  Jeez, man.  Sorry.  And, uh, I found out  my wife had been  cheating on me for  four years.  So she got the house  and the cars and I  got the kids.  I moved them up here  to New Hampshire.  I could use a  frigging break.  So you want to go,  uh, out on a date?  Yeah, I do.  To the Bunny Ranch  in Nevada?  Oh, yeah.  I'll go wherever.  I like this Mike guy.  Are you still married  to her?  Yeah, I can't get to  worse until I go back  to New Orleans.  And I'm really not  looking forward to that  trip.  Oh, how old are your  kids?  Uh, 11, uh, daughter,  seven daughter, and 
[01:25:30]  four sons.  Wow.  What a bitch.  My God.  All right, hold on a  line.  That was living his  whole life like that  for the kids.  That would count as  charity work, too, for  us.  Yeah, that is charity  work.  It's tax deductible.  Yeah, we'll have a  nice write-off.  Katrina Relief.  Katrina Relief.  Get a guy to go to  Nevada on a date.  Takes care of a lot of  things.  That's it.  He's building up like  those levies.  You want a sad one or  a funny one?  Nothing.  Sad.  That's very funny.  I didn't hear that.  That's all right.  Listen to it on the  re...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Uh, let's say hi to  Mike at Queens.  Mike.  Hey, what's going on,  man?  Big time listener.  I'm 40 years old.  My wife died about a  year and a half ago.  I was married for 18  years.  I got married really  young.  Got a son.  Uh, that's basically it,  man.  I'm trying to get back in  the game now.  It's been about a year  and a half, but I  really don't have much  game going.  You know what I mean?  I was out of the game  for 18 years.  I was married.  Yeah, you don't know  what to say anymore.  How old are you?  I'm 40.  Oh, man.  He's been out of the 
[01:26:30]  game, though.  He's like, you know,  hey, baby, do you want  to shake a leg?  He's 40, not 109.  40's nothing, man.  All right, so he's  driving around in a 40  Conoline van, blaring  out Leonard Skinner,  driving past his old  high school looking for  girls.  He's playing Skid Row  songs saying, listen  to the words.  Listen to the words, man.  He does drive around.  Dude, I drive around  in my van all day in  Manhattan.  Do you?  I'm an operating  engineer.  I drive around.  Do you have an  airbrushed picture of  a big guy holding a 
[01:27:00]  sword?  Like the Molly  Hatchet album cover?  Yeah, man.  Do you have bubble  windows and Kragers on  it?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  I'm from Queens, man.  That's Long Island  stuff, that corny van  crap.  Oh yeah, once you  passed that Queens  line, it got all  classy.  That's it, it's  hard for you.  You know the deal.  All right, Mike, hold  on the line.  All right, man.  We got some great  stories coming in.  So basically, we're  going to get a date  for dad in Nevada at  the Bunny Ranch for  Father's Day and  possibly a date for the  son or the daughter 
[01:27:30]  that introduces us to  their dad.  So far, we got some  great stories.  Which one do you like  the most so far?  Oh, God, that one  before the train guy.  You like train guy?  No, no, the one  before train guy.  The brain tumor guy?  The guy with the  screws in his neck and  the, yeah, the wife  died of the brain tumor.  The soulmate?  The first wife left and  then the son's wife left  him.  Yeah.  For a cop.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's a good one.  Yeah, that's pretty good. 
[01:28:00]  They're both pretty  pathetic.  What about the father  living with mom for 20  years?  Father living with mom is  wasting his life away.  What about the father  that hasn't had sex in  12 years and he's still  married and thinks the  wife won't care?  The wife won't even  care.  That's a great  relationship to be in.  Wife just doesn't even  care about you anymore.  When is the father's  day?  A week from Sunday?  We don't care.  It's not even on the  calendar.  Why bother?  It's just a day for us,  Jimmy.  You know what it's  called?  Sunday.  I call it Sunday.  S-O-N.  S-U-N-D-A-Y because 
[01:28:30]  it doesn't matter.  It's called  distraction day.  You just try to  distract yourself all  day.  That's good.  And you can't wait  until Monday.  Just drive down those  thin, curvy roads of  the cemetery.  Why not?  What a pleasant  day.  Trying to figure out  which one.  That's fun every year.  Oh boy, a lot has  changed in a year.  Look at the little  map.  Which one?  Where?  I think it's over  here.  Let me pick the weeds  off.  It's great.  You should never go on 
[01:29:00]  Father's and Mother's  Day.  You should just go on a  weird off day like the  Tuesday before.  Go on an off day.  They know.  They're looking down and  going, you picked an  easy date, didn't you?  I wasn't worth the  traffic jam.  You say, look.  That's what dear old  dad's thinking.  Do you want me to talk  to you with all these  cars driving by or do  you want to just do  this quiet?  Trust me.  Dad will understand.  Will he?  Yes.  All right.  We got some great  stories coming in.  I don't think so.  This is going to be a  huge hit for us.  We're going to get  a data date for  Father's Day at the  Bunny Ranch in Nevada. 
[01:29:30]  A date.  We'll talk to Dennis  Hoff on Monday with  more of the details.  And we'll give the  trip away by next  Friday.  I think Brian  Regan's here.  We'll talk to him  next.  It's Opie and  Anthony.  WXRK FM New York  92.3 KROQ.  92.3 KROQ.  It's the Opie and  Anthony show.  Brian Regan on his  way into the studio.  Chuck Liddell coming  up in about, what,  20 minutes or so.  Nicole Richie 
[01:30:00]  calling.  Got a busy, busy  show today.  It's Opie and  Anthony.  And Jimmy, what do  we got?  What's that Jones  Beach thing again?  Well, tomorrow, you  have to tune in.  There's a special  announcement about a  ticket special for the  Jones Beach show only.  Right now, there's a  deal on mezzanine  tickets.  You can get four for  $69.  The show is obviously  June 16th, which is,  I think, a week from  nine days out.  Yeah, this Saturday.  A week from Saturday.  It's brought to you by  Bud Light.  Always worth it. 
[01:30:30]  And, you know, tune in  tomorrow for this ticket  special for Jones Beach  only.  It's our comedy show, and  you can get all the info  at VirusTour, one word,  on MySpace, okay?  But tickets are available  through Ticketmaster,  Ticketmaster.com.  The mezzanine deal is  really, really good, by the  way.  Four tickets for how  much?  Four tickets for $69.  Eight or nine comedians  from the show, the O&A  Village, the tailgating, it's  going to be an all-day thing.  That's actually cheaper  than three are supposed  to be.  They're usually $26 a piece,  so four are supposed to 
[01:31:00]  cost you over $100.  Yeah.  A bargain.  All right, we got Bear  back on the show.  Bear, are you there?  Yeah, I'm here.  What's up?  All right, and we got  your wife, Louise.  Louise, I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm here.  Wow.  Wait, hi, Louise.  Louise?  Yeah.  Bear?  Yeah.  Okay.  Kind of sounds like the  same person.  All right, so we got  Bear and Louise on the  phones here at the same  time.  Yep.  Hey, Bear, did you  explain what's going on  to your wife? 
[01:31:30]  No, not really.  I didn't go with the  details.  I was called not to,  so.  Ah, good, good.  Hey, Louise.  Louise, you know why  we called you?  Uh, what?  Do you know why we  called you?  No, not really.  He woke me up out of  a dead sleep.  I don't know what the  hell's going on.  How many kids you guys  got?  Four.  Four?  Yeah.  Twins that are what,  12?  12, 15, 17.  Got your hands  flew full, do you?  I'm sorry?  Got your hands 
[01:32:00]  flew, do you?  Hey, can we start  over?  Never mind.  Hands flew.  Well, go ahead.  Do you guys have a  pretty active, uh,  Louise, do you guys  have a pretty active,  uh, you know,  physical, sexual,  you know?  Is the relationship  still passionate?  Who, me?  Yeah.  No.  No?  Why not?  What's, what's the  problem?  No interest whatsoever.  Four kids, a big house,  I work, I can't be  bothered.  Wow.  Now, Louise, I gotta be 
[01:32:30]  honest with you.  Um, do you, are you in  love with your husband?  Eh, I wouldn't say love,  but, you know, we're living  like everybody else does.  Who can say it?  Well, no, it's really,  see, Louise, it really  isn't like everybody else  does.  Well, it's probably more  common than you think,  though.  Yeah, but it really, it  seems like, um, do you  do understand that men,  uh, do have certain needs,  right?  Of course.  Yeah, and you're not  giving, uh, your man  those needs. 
[01:33:00]  He can get needs wherever  he can find needs.  This is nice.  I'm stunned at this.  Now, Bear, does this kind  of, like, upset you a  little bit that your wife  really, uh, doesn't care  much about what you do or  whether you live or die  from the sound of it?  Ah, I didn't say that.  Well, I think that's  fortunate, you know.  Oh, okay.  It's whether I live or die,  but I think it seems, I'll  be honest with you, it 
[01:33:30]  seems like, you know, I'm  just like a paycheck, you  know.  Ah, okay.  So you go to, you go to  work and she uses the  money to take care of  the kids and run the  house, I guess.  Was there a time when  you guys, was there a  time when you were in  love?  Of course.  What was your, what was  your, what was your  wedding song?  Oh, geez, I don't know.  Yeah, it's gonna be  just a, I don't know.  You light up my life,  I think.  I don't know.  Go ahead.  She wants to talk.  I don't get to talk.  Well, Jesus Christ. 
[01:34:00]  So, so it might have  been you light up my  life?  Yeah, something like  that.  And, and, uh, did you  have a traditional  wedding or was it a  justice of the peace or  something?  Was it a big thing?  Yeah, it was a little  shindig, nothing major.  Nothing major, but, but  did, you did, uh, have  people over and, and  did you get to dance and  look into each other's  eyes and, and wonder  what, and wonder what the  future was going to  bring as you gazed in  each other's eyes with  you light up my life  playing in the  background?  Did you think you'd  end up here?  No. 
[01:34:30]  No.  Nobody thinks who  they're going to end  up.  They always think that  life's going to be  bold cherries.  Yeah.  Yeah, but were you  guys, did you guys have  four kids?  Well, I get the four  kids in the big house.  I mean, uh, was there  a time you guys were  just effing all the  time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh?  Of course.  And then what  happened?  What happened?  I got too busy, too  tired.  Too tired, too busy.  And it was because of  the kids.  When you were pregnant  with your first child,  was it a wonderful  thing?  Were you still in  love thinking, wow, 
[01:35:00]  this is going to be  great.  We're going to be  parents.  Yeah.  Good.  It's a whole new  world.  It was like Star  Trek, a new  adventure.  Star Trek, a new  adventure.  Oh, my God.  Well, we got our  sex expert in studio,  Brian Regan.  Well, there is an  area on her body  where no man has  gone in years.  In 12 years.  In years.  Brian, Brian Regan,  everybody.  We're talking to  Bear and Louise.  Yeah.  Louise.  Louise.  We keep talking  about her like  she's going to  be at the  Puerto Rican  Day Parade. 
[01:35:30]  I don't know why.  I can't.  Her name is  Louise.  Louise.  Bear and Louise.  Bear and Louise.  And they haven't  had relations.  Relations.  Yes.  In 12 years  because of the  kids.  And the kids  and for some  reason, the  big house,  they can't find  each other.  She keeps  saying this  big house.  They're nude  from door to  door.  Hello?  Where are you?  I can't find  you.  This is a  role in this  house.  No person or  animals will  have to be  sexual in my  house.  That's it,  huh?  Let me tell  you. 
[01:36:00]  We have like  10 or 12  cats, 15  cats.  Oh my God.  You got all  that running  around and I'm  not getting any.  You know what  I'm saying?  Oh, we  understand that  analogy.  Yes.  The, uh,  the female.  Yeah.  You got all  those pussies  around and, uh,  make your own  joke at home.  There you go.  All right.  Now, uh,  Bear, be  honest with  me.  Is it too  many cats?  Yeah.  How did you  let, how did  you let her  talk you into  that many  cats?  Yeah.  How did  you let your  wife turn 
[01:36:30]  into a  crazy cat  woman?  In all  honesty, what  happened was  I'm sent,  you know, I, I,  I brought a  lot of them  home.  I find little  kittens and I  bring them  home and  hopefully we'll  find homes and  then we end up  keeping them.  I brought quite a few  them homes.  We have a little  sign on the tree  out front.  Free kittens  with the K  backwards.  Yeah.  That, that gag  never works, man.  If you bring a  cat home, it's  yours for good.  You're not going  to find a home  enough.  You bring it  into your own  house.  And everyone's  attached to it  and everything. 
[01:37:00]  Somebody gets  attached.  Uh, Louise,  have, have you  or Bear, uh,  let yourselves  go?  Uh, not  stupid, man.  I still get  looked at  occasionally.  Looked at  occasionally.  Yeah, I get  the beads and  everything.  They still look  good in a nice  tight shirt.  All right, that  means you got  the...  She sure looks  good.  All right, how  old a gal are  you, if I may  ask?  I'm 44.  44.  How much have  you gained since  your wedding  night?  Oh, nothing.  I'm still the  same size.  I'm 125 pounds. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  With big boobies,  obviously, if you  look good in the  t-shirt.  20 pounds of  boobies.  How big are the  boobies?  36 C's.  36 C's.  Wow.  All right, and  how much has your  husband gained since  the wedding?  I don't know.  He's a little  slobby, but  nothing disgusting.  A little slobby?  How romantic.  In that middle  area between  slobby and  disgusting.  Does he take  care of himself,  or does he have  toenails like  corn chips?  Fit it in for the  day.  Very good, Anthony. 
[01:38:00]  I'll explain  later, Brian.  We do stuff to  keep ourselves  from getting  bored.  It's a bit.  It's a bit.  I like to actually  hit the salon and  get their  pedicures and  stuff, but any  working man that  I know has  corn chips for  toenails.  I listen there.  When someone else  says it, it really  sounds disgusting.  I'm trying to be  funny.  It's a sign of  virility.  You grind those  up and put them  in your soup.  I don't know how  corn chips.  Wow.  These two are  classic. 
[01:38:30]  All right, so  listen.  So, do you have a  desire to get some  action there?  Who, me?  Yeah, Louise, you  just have no  desire for any  type of...  I have dreams  occasionally.  I say, oh, I  should, oh, I  should, but then I  get out and reality  smacks me in the  face, and I ain't  got time to...  I'll tell you, a  husband bear should  smack you in the  face with something  else.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're not  attracted to him  anymore?  You just don't  want it?  It's none of  it.  Hey, listen, after 
[01:39:00]  the first two  years, it's easy.  You get no  desire and no  nothing.  Do you have  fantasies about  other men, maybe,  like movie stars  or something?  Of course.  Who's like a guy  that you have this  sexual fantasy about?  Nobody in  particular.  Oh, come on.  That means it's a  neighbor or a  friend or someone  that they both  know.  It's probably  Denzel Washington,  Wesley Snipes.  I don't know.  I'll see a nice  looking guy in the  street a couple  days later, he'll  pop in my head  when I'm sleeping.  Do you take  care of things?  I'm sorry? 
[01:39:30]  You take care of  yourself?  Yeah.  I like that, no.  No, she don't  like that.  So you've been  completely asexual  for years.  Yes, I have.  Wow.  And it doesn't  bother you in the  least.  Hey, Bear, what  do you...  It's about me, fellas.  I thought this was  about Father's Day.  Well, it is.  That's why we're  working it up.  We're trying to see  how pathetic you  actually are.  And on the pathetic  scale, you're ringing  the bell, sir.  Oh, you sure are.  Bear, so do you...  I guess you take  care of things, right?  Oh, definitely.  Are you getting any  on the side? 
[01:40:00]  Might as well admit it  to your wife live on  our show.  I've had opportunities,  to be honest, but it's...  I would feel...  I don't know.  You can't feel guilty.  Sir, if you have to  go into court at any  time for a divorce or  anything, these tapes  from this program will  exonerate you.  Yeah, they'll understand.  They will understand.  They will listen to  Louise's testimony that  she has had here on  this show and just  give you everything.  Yeah.  These two are... 
[01:40:30]  I love these two.  Brian Reagan, you  got a question for  the lovely couple?  They sound lovey-dovey.  They sound like they  should be attracted to  each other.  I don't see what the  issue is.  Yeah, they sound like  the perfect couple.  Just put the cats in  one room, you guys go  in another room, and  problem solved, right?  Nah, I don't think so.  We don't sleep in the  chamber anymore.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  Here's another new one.  All right, you don't...  I got four girls, and 
[01:41:00]  I'm trying to teach them  absence, okay?  Oh, my God.  She's going to ruin  four girls.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  You're ruining four girls  for us guys out there.  No, I'm not.  Now, you sleep...  Waiting for the right  guy at the right time.  So you didn't pick the  right guy is what you're  saying?  No, no, no, no, no.  I was older.  I was much older.  My kids are just  teenagers.  I don't want them to  think having sex with  anybody is okay.  But it's not anybody.  It's their father.  Like, you guys don't  even sleep in the same  room anymore.  That sounded odd, Opie. 
[01:41:30]  I don't set the  example who they  learn from.  No, but what I was  saying, Abby, because  she basically said  they sleep in separate  rooms because they  don't want a bad  example for the  daughters.  Right.  And I'm saying,  well, it's their  father you're having  sex with.  And you're married.  And you're married.  And the thing is,  think back, Louise.  When you were a  teen girl, you were  probably a goer, right?  A wife?  A goer?  No, actually, no.  I was a really good  girl.  My first boyfriend I  had when I was 15.  We didn't have sex, so  we were 18, and I 
[01:42:00]  wound up marrying him.  Oh.  Well, no wonder you're  a mess.  Is this your first?  Have you slept with  only one guy in your  life?  Three, actually, my  whole life.  Well, what happened?  Wait, wait.  What happened?  How did that work?  If you hooked up  last weekend somewhere,  the math isn't  working out here.  Yeah, you hooked up  with Bear, you had  sex with him, and  then you got married.  Where did the other  two guys come in?  That's the second  marriage, I bet.  Oh, no, that was  between him.  That was my first  husband, one man, 
[01:42:30]  and then him.  Oh, okay.  So you had a  boyfriend when you  were 15.  At 18, you had sex  with that boyfriend.  You broke up with  him.  No, no, no, no,  no.  That one I wanted  to marry.  So another husband.  She was married  once before.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, so Bear,  these aren't all  your kids. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, you didn't  have any kids  with the other  guy, right?  No, no, I didn't.  Lucky him.  They better be  my kids.  Let me tell you,  my father was  from Hungary.  He was very  strict.  He brought me  good morals.  Good morals?  He ruined you,  and you're ruining  your daughters.  Well, you know,  I will.  Nah.  I know, I love her.  Do you have a 17-year-old  daughter?  Do you want to  have sex?  No, I, no.  Well, hey, listen,  so it sounds like 
[01:43:30]  you're not attracted  to Bear in any way  anymore.  Well, I mean,  do you know people  who've been together  almost 17, 18 years  and they're still  having sex with each  other?  I know many couples  that don't.  I know people  that do.  There are people  that do and people  that don't.  All right.  Well, why don't we  explain what's going  on here?  Father's Day right  around the corner.  What are the girls  getting for dad this  year?  I'm sorry?  What are the girls  getting for dad this  year?  Father's Day.  I'm not exactly  sure.  We'll probably take 
[01:44:00]  a trip down to the  shore or maybe spend  a day of great  adventures or something.  What do they usually  get him for Father's  Day?  The same old,  same old?  We try to do  something a little  different.  Yeah?  Like have sex?  That's different.  Yeah, but you know  what?  If I had the money,  I'd give him a  certificate.  He could knock  himself out.  Wow.  Well, that's why  we're calling you.  Anthony, why don't  you explain what's  going on?  All right.  Well, Louise, we  spoke to Bear earlier.  He kind of let us in  on a little bit of  this story.  You've obviously  enlightened us with  a lot more detail,  but we're having a 
[01:44:30]  little contest, kind  of promotion, little  Father's Day giveaway  thing we want to do,  and Bear seems really  perfect for this.  We want to send Bear  out to Las Vegas,  Nevada to a place  called the Bunny  Ranch, where he will  go out on a date with  one of the lovely  ladies of the Bunny  Ranch.  And this date, you  know, they could go  out to dinner, they  can go to a casino,  they could do  whatever they want. 
[01:45:00]  He could take his  and put it if he  wants to.  Whatever they want  to do, they can do.  It's a date.  So how do you feel  about that, Louise?  And, you know, not  just some light  conversation here.  We're talking  seriously.  Sending him out,  doing this.  He might, you  know, get some  he might put it,  you know, which, you  know, I'm sure you  even when you were  doing it, you never  got it right. 
[01:45:30]  Something tells me  you had a constant  view of the ceiling.  Yeah.  Well, listen.  So that's what we  want to do for Bear  possibly.  We're taking more  stories, but he's got  a great story.  And when he comes  back from Vegas,  what's going to happen?  We're in Nevada,  actually.  What's going to  happen?  What's going to  happen?  Are you going to  be cool with him  or is that going  to be the, you're  not going to care?  No.  Oh, Bear, she  might be blowing  your chances. 
[01:46:00]  I got to be honest.  Yeah, we kind of  want a wife that's  going to be a little,  you know, pissed  off.  Yeah.  No, but it's also  about, I got to  say for Bear, hold  on, madam, madam,  please, madam, man  talking.  She's got four kids  and a big house,  Jimmy.  It's also about Bear  is a guy who is a  great candidate because  he's real.  This is what guys  go through.  That's true.  No guy is going to  do it and risk his  marriage.  That's true.  His wife says no,  no guy can go.  How about you guys  just have relations  today?  Nah, I don't think  so.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Have you ever heard  a more real no than 
[01:46:30]  that for anything?  Nah, I don't think  so.  I even, I know, we've  been doing this long  enough to know that we  can't even talk them  into it.  No, Louise, what,  what is, what would  it take for you to  actually have the  relations that you're  supposed to have in a  marriage with your  husband?  I don't know.  I, I, I, I really  couldn't, I really  couldn't answer that  question.  You don't know what  it would take.  Do you drink?  It's so long, it's  unnecessary for me,  you know what I'm  saying?  Yeah, but can't you  just, can't you just 
[01:47:00]  do a wifely duty?  You know what I'm  saying?  Maybe you'll come  back a happier  person.  Maybe you'll come  back a happier  person.  No, he's going to  come back a person  that goes, wow,  that's what it feels  like.  That's what I'm  missing.  And, and his bags  are going to be  packed.  You know when he's  going to be a happier  person when it, when  the police show up  and go, Bear, we  have news.  Hey, I don't care.  He's going to  support somebody and  he can support us.  I think the second  one bag is emptied,  the other one's going  to be packed and  he's leaving. 
[01:47:30]  Yo, can I say  something here?  Yeah, go ahead,  Bear.  Enough enough.  If I do win this  trip.  Yeah.  It's going to turn  out to be like a  45 second trip.  It's going to be  back on the plane  coming home.  Do it at the  gate.  He won't even get  off the plane.  She's yelling  something like he'll  be lucky to get  30 seconds.  Is that what you  just said?  45 seconds is 
[01:48:00]  long for him.  She's saying  that's the inside  of that room is  going to look like  two firemen just  put on a fire.  I don't know why  I'd say two firemen.  It just sounded  funny.  Just squirting  each other.  I was getting  tripped.  I was getting  30 seconds.  What?  Yeah, we heard.  Yeah, we heard  you.  30 seconds.  Jesus.  She's trying to  get that joke  out.  I love her.  We get it.  Yeah, we love  her.  Louise with the  four kids in the  big house.  Hey, did Bear  ever give you  the big O there  or what?  Yeah.  Were you ever 
[01:48:30]  satisfied with Bear?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because it's  kind of, it kind  of sounds like  maybe Bear  wasn't as good  and it, because  if it was really  good, you would  want to do it,  right?  No man is as  good as they  think they are.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Bear.  How do you know?  You won't know  his why is.  I think he's  the best.  Well, miss, who  would you say was  the best you've  had?  Yeah.  Actually, it was  my first.  Your first was  the best?  Oh, poor Bear. 
[01:49:00]  Not only did she  say it, she  belted it out.  She meant it  with every other  answer.  Every other answer  was, well, and  that one was,  number one.  Wow, I'm back  game with Bear.  Now we got to  Nevada.  But it was like  she had been  waiting for 20  years for someone  to just ask.  Please, someone  ask me.  Thank God, someone  finally asked me.  I've never heard  a person readier  with an answer.  Wow.  And who was  more well-endowed?  More well-endowed. 
[01:49:30]  I can't lie.  Timmy, Bear,  whatever you want  to call him.  Bear?  Bear?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But who's better  with kitty cats?  Who's better  with the kitty cats?  Me.  Who scratches  them under the  chin and makes  them stick their  head out and you  go under their  chin?  I'm the pussy  lady.  No, you're not.  You've got to get  another title.  Let me tell you  something.  Let me tell you  something.  I am brand new.  My GYN tells me I am  like a brand new  little girl. 
[01:50:00]  Okay?  What does a  gynecologist do?  Just attack you  with a leaf blower?  What do you mean?  I'm sorry?  Apparently, there's  no wreckage or  something.  No damage done.  What?  What he says,  you're fine and  dandy?  Yeah, I'm good to  go.  Well, you don't.  Yeah.  Are you planning on  getting some action  soon from something  or somebody?  No, actually I'm  not. 
[01:50:30]  I'm too busy with my  kids and my house  and my house.  And the big house.  You don't care though?  You don't care if you  ever, ever have sex  again?  No, I'm going to eat  top 10 now.  Wait, miss, your kids  are 17, two 12-year-old  twins, and how old is the  other one?  15.  All right, so they  all go to school.  What do you do?  Like when they leave  for school, do you  still run around  going, my kids, my  kids, and just  setting things up?  What do you do  when they're gone  at school?  When they're not  in school?  No, when they  are in school.  When they are in  school, like you  said, I work, I get  a big house to take  care, a lot of  animals to take 
[01:51:00]  care of, I keep  occupied.  She has brought so  much things into her  life that she doesn't  have to have any  kind of relationship  with the husband.  Basically, yeah.  Yeah, but it's not.  It's derogatory  towards him.  You know what I  mean?  It's not a knock  or anything.  It kind of is.  It kind of is a  little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little derogatory.  A little bit.  Wait a minute.  I got to know.  Who is the second  best?  Yeah, who is the  second best guy 
[01:51:30]  you've ever been  with?  I'm going to answer  this one right.  The guy before  Timmy.  Are you kidding?  The guy before  Bear.  All right.  But Bear's in the  top three, right?  All right, Bear.  Hey, Bear, you  won the bronze.  You know, you  placed.  All right, Bear.  Win, place, or  show, you placed.  If we played him  across the board,  we'd be cashing  the winning ticket.  You'd be cashing  in.  Yo, fellas. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Fellas?  Yeah.  Well, no, when you  answered that question,  I was afraid you  would say the guy  in the bus station.  Bear, you have  no position to talk.  You're the worst  lady that poor  woman has ever  had.  You drove her  away from sex.  Yeah.  That's what's  going on here.  Bear, it sounds  like you didn't  know how to do  it right, and  she's like, I'd  rather not.  Hey, Louise.  Let me see.  I got four.  Yeah, we understand  the biological part  of it worked, but  that could be done  with a turkey  baster.  Louise, if I  could ask you a  question. 
[01:52:30]  Did Bear take  care of you in  other ways than  the conventional  we're making  baby's version  of relations?  Of course.  In the early  years?  In the early  years, he would  do other things  to make you  feel good.  Of course.  I'll do it  right now.  What early  years?  I'll do it  right now.  Oh, see?  Bear's willing.  You understand,  Louise?  Do you hear  in Bear's  voice?  He kind of  wants to do  this, but you  are so dead set  against this.  What's the  longest Bear 
[01:53:00]  lasted?  Oh, jeez.  I don't  remember.  About?  Like the  best day I  can remember?  Yeah.  Best?  Ten minutes?  Wait.  Yeah.  When's the last  time he really  tried to hit on  you and you  said no?  What?  When's the last  time he tried to  sleep with you and  you said no?  Uh, it's  after the twins  maybe, three  months later when  they're screaming  and crying, and  then the other  one whinging at  me like, you  gotta be kidding.  Get away. 
[01:53:30]  So we're  talking like  1995?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, we gotta  let them.  Oh, I've tried  since then.  I guess you  can get your  hands off me.  Oh, so you  try, you play a  little grab ass  and she goes,  get out of  here.  Exactly.  Why don't  you guys just  get divorced?  Why?  No.  Why?  What's the  point?  So Bear  could get  some, you  know.  We still  have things  in common  and we do  what we  can do.  Yeah, but  see, Bear  told us, you 
[01:54:00]  know, he's  had opportunities  but he feels  guilty, but I'm  thinking if you  guys were  divorced, you  wouldn't feel  guilty anymore,  and then he  would be  satisfied as  far as that  part of his  life goes.  What do you  have in common  besides the  fact that  neither one  of you likes  penis?  Yeah.  Yeah, what  is it?  What is it that  you guys  share?  I have friends  with my penis.  See, she just  laughs at me.  She's talking  about I have  friends with my  penis.  What, uh,  Louise, what  is it that you  guys share in  this marriage that 
[01:54:30]  keeps you a  married couple  that you're not  just roommates  that you enjoy  each other's  company with?  Oh, well,  besides the kids,  you know, we  have mutual  friends.  We go, we  have a good  time.  You know, we  go out  occasionally when  we can get  every day  stupid stuff.  Listen, we  got it.  They're just  like pals.  We got a  break.  We got Brian  Regan in  studio.  We got  Chris Liddell.  He's coming  in in a  second.  We got  Nicole Richie  calling in.  We got to  do all this  in like 20  minutes.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Wow.  Crazy.  Hey, I think  we're going to  have to talk to  you guys a  little more  tomorrow or  Monday.  But Bear is  definitely the  leading candidate  to go out to  a bunny ranch in  Nevada and get  some dating in  for Father's Day.  Yep.  What did Luis say?  about that.  She doesn't care.  She's fine with  it?  Yeah.  She'll drive  into the airport.  What's that,  Luis?  What did you do  for Mother's Day?  Did you hook up  any women for  Mother's Day?  We would be  happy to.  What would we do  for someone like  you, let's say?  Well, I mean,  something that you  just couldn't turn 
[01:55:30]  down.  Like what?  Like something that  I dream about.  What do you dream  about?  Big, tall,  tan, tattooed,  just something you  never would like  to go of.  Bear, get a  tattoo.  She is so  emasculating.  I love it.  Her voice is  deeper than her  husband's and she's  completely emasculating.  I love it.  She's fantastic.  I love this brawn.  All right, you two.  They call it a bunny  ranch for the men.  What do you call it  for the women?  All right, we're 
[01:56:00]  going to have to  figure it out.  We might have to  like take care of  you too.  All right, guys,  you guys have been  great.  We got to go for  now.  Jimmy, you got a  problem with me  going to the  ranch?  No problem at all  with going to the  ranch.  I think she thinks  it's like a horse  ranch.  Yeah, we go  riding.  She was asking  Bear, whose real  name is Jimmy.  Bear, do you have  a problem as she  went there?  Went where?  Like went and did  what you want to do.  To the bunny ranch  with you?  Or somewhere else.  You know, you might  be enlightened.  The two of you  might actually, you  know, if she watches  you go out on this 
[01:56:30]  date.  Maybe that'll  kind of get you  where you kind of  rejuvenate yourselves  and think, wow,  this will kind of  get our juices  flowing again.  At this point,  I'm open to  anything.  Yeah, unfortunately  your wife isn't.  All right.  Listen, we're  killing ourselves.  We got to take a  break.  All right, Bear  and Luis.  Luis again.  Luis.  I don't know why  I keep saying that.  Luis Guzman.  We'll be in touch.  We'll call you guys  back soon, okay?  Yeah.  All right, Bear  is definitely the  leading candidate  for the date at 
[01:57:00]  the Bunny Ranch  in Nevada for  Father's Day.  Damn, I love  those two.  Yeah, Brian  Regan in studio,  Chuck Liddell in  the green room,  Nicole Ritchie  getting ready to  call.  It's going to get  crazy for the  next 15 minutes.  Stay there.  It's Opie and  Anthony.  Opie and  Anthony.  92.  K-Rock.  92.  3 K-Rock.  3.  It's the Opie and  Anthony Show.  Zero.  Hi, welcome  back to the Opie  and Anthony  program. 
[01:57:30]  I'm Anthony.  Opie's the one  with his mouth full.  You have to, like,  gorge yourself  during these breaks.  You've got to eat.  Opie's a grazer.  I have to eat all  day.  He has to eat all  day.  All day long.  I have one thing  in the morning.  Brian Regan in  the studio.  We got to him  late because of  that crazy couple  we just had on the  air, Brian.  They were a nice  couple.  Lauren, thank you.  Yeah.  Jeez, that's a  disaster.  And you're playing  in the round  tomorrow night?  Yes.  In Westbury?  They changed the 
[01:58:00]  name of the theater,  but it's the Westbury  North Fork.  North Fork.  Yeah.  I saw Bob Saget  there in the round.  I was just telling  Brian off mic.  It's hilarious because  he was trying to  refer back to an  old lady that he  was, like, talking  to throughout the  whole show, but  the stage is moving  and he got all  confused, didn't know  where she was  anymore.  And then you said  that you had a  heckler behind you  or something?  I had a guy, uh,  first time I did  one of those round  ones.  There was somebody  shouting stuff out  behind me and I  wasn't wise enough  to realize I could  just turn around  and face them. 
[01:58:30]  I was, like, doing  comebacks over my  shoulder.  Why?  Oh, yeah.  Listen, you wait  until I spin around  your way, buddy.  I got a thing or two  to say about what  you just shouted out.  You just wait.  Can we speed up  the turntable?  I gotta yell at  this guy.  Yeah, who's in  charge of the  spinning wheel?  Put me on 78 RPM,  please.  And then Brian  pointed out that he  thought it was funny  that, like, a  helicopter company  is a sponsor on  our show.  Why was that funny? 
[01:59:00]  No, I just...  No, it's nice.  It's a nice...  I want to put you on  the spot.  It's a...  Well, I mean, I,  you know, I can see...  Not you guys.  Any radio show,  you have, like,  beer sponsors and  stuff.  This is the first time  I've heard of  helicopter pilot  training school.  I think you're  laughing because  you've, you know,  you've performed in  front of a bunch of  our listeners over  the years and you  don't think they  can handle a helicopter.  No, that...  Is that what you're  saying?  When I see your  listeners, I think  chopper pilots. 
[01:59:30]  I think these guys  should be up in the  air flying around  patrolling the city.  When I read the  message boards, yeah,  those are the people  I want to fly with.  I want to, you know,  I want to go to  Atlantic City.  Can you please  chopper me over there?  I'd rather fly out  of a schoolyard  in the apocalypse  now.  They see a bunch  of helicopters with  a wow bumper  stickers on the  back of them.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  But that's cool,  man.  They get some good  pilots out of this  whole program. 
[02:00:00]  Exactly.  That's what it's  all about.  You know, a majority  of the listeners  never call in or  never go to  appearances.  So it's not the  people you usually  see at our shows.  You wouldn't have  somebody with a  wacky like, hey,  what's your  pilot's name?  Well, on the  message board,  he's old gravy  leg and a hell  of a pilot.  Brian, you got a  Comedy Central  special?  Is that this  weekend?  It's Sunday  night.  One hour, right?  One hour.  Nice.  Comedy Central.  One hour of 
[02:00:30]  stand-up and  three minutes of  laughter.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, you.  Are you doing it  live or you already  shot it?  Already shot it.  That's great, dude.  And you got a  DVD out and he's  playing North Fork on  Long Island.  Busy, busy, busy.  He's doing the  big places these  days.  I was reading an  article because I  think you just  played Philly?  Coming up, I'm  doing Upper Darby  Saturday night.  Okay.  I was reading the  Philadelphia papers  today and you  were being  interviewed and they  were talking about  how nice of a  comedian you are and  stuff and you  decided a long time  ago to just be nice 
[02:01:00]  but you got evil  thoughts in you.  And one of these  days, boy, I'll tell  you, I'm going to get  some of these evil  thoughts out.  I think the closest  we ever got was  Ron and Fez on  Ron and Fez's show  when we were all  drinking.  Well, that was  after many Bud  Lights.  Yeah.  We almost got  Brian to really  speak his mind.  Oh, was that a  good one?  I was close to  saying dang that  night.  Yeah.  That's what we  were trying to get  out of you.  That was close,  man.  Dang.  They say, gosh,  gosh darn it.  I thought I was  going to say it, but 
[02:01:30]  then he went into a  dag nabbit.  Dag nabbit?  Dag nabbit.  Or dad burn it.  That's another one.  Dad burn it.  Dad burn it.  Would that ever  come out of  somebody?  You know what I  mean?  You stub your toe  on a coffee table.  I can't see anybody  saying, dad burn  it.  What?  I just stubbed  the big toe, dad  burn it.  Gosh dang it all.  The bad words have  to come out.  Yeah, that's when  they fly. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, are you a  fan of UFC?  We set up a little  UFC match with  you today.  Ultimate fighting  champion.  Oh, okay.  I'm thinking.  Yeah, we decided  to surprise you.  We're going to have  a Kentucky fried  chicken competitor.  I like KFC.  UFC, not so much.  Ultimate fried  chicken.  Ultimate fried  chicken I do  like.  Ukrainian fried  chicken.  Ukrainian fried  chicken is okay.  I prefer the  Kentucky fried, but  they're both good.  They really are.  Have you ever had 
[02:02:30]  a fight anyone in  your life there,  Brian?  Ever get in a  little confrontation  and you had to  take care of  business?  How do you get  out of it?  You got to move  or something?  You ever put up  your dukes?  You ever like,  oh, let's go.  Last night, the  red eye, I didn't  think we were going  fast enough.  So I worked my way  up into the cockpit  and took care of  business.  Sometimes you have  to.  You know what I  mean?  I'm like, how come  we're not going full  throttle?  And the guy looked at  me and I just started  wailing on him.  And this is why 
[02:03:00]  Regan is so  successful and I  am languishing  because UFC, he  goes on this great  tear about all these  funny abbreviations  and all I can think  of is that kind of  sounds like how I  talk to my  grandfather.  Oh, you see?  UFC?  That's good.  Always.  Brian Regan.  Oh, man.  No kidding.  How are you?  That's my pilot.  That's his last night.  He's a chopper pilot.  Chuck Liddell, everyone.  Do you know  Brian Regan?  How are you, man?  One of the funniest 
[02:03:30]  guys in America, if  not the funniest guy  in America.  Very kind.  Me and Jim Norton.  Jim Norton and I.  Well, I'm sorry.  That's always awkward.  Top, top, top three.  Top four hundred.  I'll go with it.  I was top three.  And Chuck Liddell  does UFC.  You know Chuck, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  Yeah.  How are you, man?  We were rooting for you  as far as that last  fight goes.  Oh, yeah.  You know, you take  out two of the bastards  that had beaten you  before.  And the third  guy comes in there 
[02:04:00]  and, wow.  Caught me.  Ooh, did he catch you?  We were watching the  video and, man,  you got tagged  and I can't even  imagine what that  must have felt like.  I've seen you take  shots and just  shake them off.  But that one really  just put you on the  mat.  Caught me right on the  tip of the chin.  I mean, I was back a  couple seconds after it  was over.  Yeah, yeah, I saw  that.  But it was, and it  didn't cause any  problems.  So it wasn't, it was 
[02:04:30]  just that quick flash  knockdown that, you  know, he was able to  follow up real quick.  I think the fact that  he followed up so  quickly and got over  you got the ref to  jump in like that.  I was, I mean, it  was a good stop.  I mean, it was.  Do you think, do you  think, honestly, you  would have been able to  fight out of that if  you would have been  given a little more  time?  If he'd give me a  couple seconds of  rampage, give me a  couple seconds on the  mat, I would have  been ready to go  again.  They had to pull him  off, though, because  there was one second  where it just seemed  like you stopped  moving.  Oh, no, no, no,  definitely the right  thing.  No, I'm saying if he 
[02:05:00]  hadn't jumped on so  quick.  Good strategy, I  guess.  I'm not disagreeing  with you.  If he had backed  off.  Jimmy just called  you a pussy.  Do you know what  Jimmy said, Chuck?  Jimmy just called  you a pussy.  Were you lost?  Look at the look  he's given.  No, no, no, no.  I can't believe you  said that, Jimmy.  Jimmy's one of your  biggest fans.  I love Chuck, man.  Chuck just gave a  look that was beyond  real.  I wouldn't know.  I was looking at  Anthony's knees.  The temperature  dropped 20 degrees  on that look.  Oh, my God, did it. 
[02:05:30]  When did you  realize, I wonder  this, because it  seemed like you  looked up and  actually said,  what happened?  When someone  catches you like  that, all of a  sudden, it's very  sudden.  I knew what  happened when I  got up.  Like I said, it's  one of those flash  knockdown kind of  things.  You went in kind  of low.  You went in for  some body shots,  and as you  pulled back, did  you see it coming  and did you say  to yourself, oh  crap, I left  myself kind of  open here?  No, but that is  I was throwing  something that my  trainers told me  not to throw for  a long time.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  And it's one of  those things, this  is why, and that  was why you get 
[02:06:00]  caught, you're  open for that.  What was it?  It's just open  lean with a body  hook.  I mean, I have a  bad tendency to do  it.  And your trainers  told me every  time I do it, not  to do it, and I've  gotten away with it  in the past, and  this time I didn't.  So maybe.  What's your first  thought when you  come up?  What's the first  thought in your  head when you  come to after a  hit like that?  I was.  Do you know  where you are?  Well, I did, yeah.  So right away you  wake up and go, 
[02:06:30]  oh man.  My trainer wouldn't  even let him  interview me if I  didn't.  He walked up, the  first thing he  asked me, he  walked up and  said, where are  you?  Yeah.  He asked me a  few questions to  make sure I knew  where I was, I  knew what was  going on, otherwise  he wouldn't even  let him interview me  after the fight.  He would have  walked me out of  the ring and not  let me talk.  You ever get hit so  hard you wake up and  you're like, wow,  what's going on  there?  Do you get really  confused?  He usually looks at  people that have  that thought and  feeling.  Do you like this? 
[02:07:00]  I was kind of  like what Oprah  was saying.  I was thinking  like when you,  like something like  that happens,  like, all right,  the championship has  changed hands.  Do you realize the  magnitude of that at  the moment or are  you like later kind  of quiet in your  room going, God  damn it.  Like, does it hit  you later or?  I think it hits you  pretty, it hits you  right away.  Then it hits you  more later.  You kind of get,  kind of start going  through what, what,  what's gone on,  you know, what  you've lost or  whatever.  It looked like such,  you know, it just  gets it, you know,  you're almost there.  Yeah, I was almost  where I wanted to be.  I was, you know,  one fight away from 
[02:07:30]  being, having what I  want to do.  Retribution.  Having everything  done and now, now  I've got a few more  left, I got a few  more left, so I'll be  around for a while.  Well, he had not  what, nine years  younger, right?  I mean, that's a,  that's a big  difference, man, when  two guys are fighting.  That's a hard thing  to overcome.  It's all right.  We'll see.  Yeah, he's ready  to get back in there.  That did look like  it tagged you, it  looked like it tagged  you just on the tip  of your chin.  And that's, that's  probably why, I think  that's, that, that  catching it right  there is why, why  it rocked me for a  second.  You think if you  would have just got  in the side of the  face more, what does  that, what does that 
[02:08:00]  do, it just rocks  your jawbone around?  It turns your head.  More leverage, I guess.  What, what prevents  you guys from not  having shattered jaws?  Like, if any of us  got hit like that in  this studio, we'd still  be in the hospital.  Because he's a real  man and we're  like, built like  glass, little glass  unicorns on a shelf.  I know.  Yeah.  With three swooning  fairies asking a man  questions.  What's it like to  have muscles?  Chuck, we said it  before you got here.  You're one of the only,  you're one of the only 
[02:08:30]  guys that comes in here  that we're like  intimidated in front of.  I mean, I think  you're the only one  that has come in that  we're like, oh my God,  don't say the wrong  thing.  I'm thinking, I'm  thinking of every word  in my head before it  comes out.  Chuck, I said why, and  I'll answer why.  Because we all know  that there's a whole  professional fighter,  not professional fighters  thing.  So we understand that  there's that barrier.  We don't know if you do.  So that would be the  scary thing.  Like, okay, let's say  Liddell realized I  shouldn't have hit them.  Well, that's a little  too late. 
[02:09:00]  I just like the idea,  Jimmy brought up  something earlier,  that the fact that  you can go anywhere  with a girl or  whoever you're with  and know that you're  not going to, like,  have these problems.  You know, that you  could take care of  business.  You ever have a girl  maybe open her mouth  and you go, honey,  could you shut the  hell up?  You're going to get  me killed.  South Street, Philly,  driving behind some  Harley Davidson guys,  and they were going a  little slow, so my  girlfriend decided to  beep the horn.  I'm like, are you crazy?  I'm not Chuck Liddell.  I'm not Chuck Liddell, 
[02:09:30]  all right?  I know I come across  as a tough guy and I  can handle some  situations, but I can't  take on four of these  guys because they're  going a little too slow.  We have to knock our  girlfriends out when  that happens in order  to save our own asses.  I had to burn the  village to save it.  What do you think of,  like, I watch Crow Cop  get, and it seems like  with you guys, man, the  fights don't last long  because there's so many  weapons.  One mistake is  unsurvivable.  Like, with boxers,  they can tie each other  up.  You guys don't have  that luxury. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, I mean, yeah,  you make that mistake.  It's over.  I mean, you know, if I  had an eight count, you  know, I would have been  back on my feet again.  It would have been just  fine.  You guys are making  boxing look like such  an old sport now.  We had a whole discussion  about this the other  day.  It's like, it's really  hard to watch boxing  when you get into the  UFC stuff.  It's really hard.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you're making  curling look ridiculous.  Yeah, it's just so  much more exciting and  action-packed.  And, you know, I  guess, unfortunately, 
[02:10:30]  that's kind of what got  you in that last match.  But, you know, I'm  certain you'll be back.  We get a rematch.  Well, I think I'll be  fighting someone else  before that.  Hopefully fight in  September, October,  and then I'll rematch.  You fight like every  three or four months?  Yeah, three or four  months, yeah.  You're not afraid of  guys.  Like the pride guys,  like Krokop came over  and it was Fedorov  as well.  Is he undefeated?  Fedor, I'm sorry.  Is he undefeated or  no?  I think so.  He's like the only  guy. 
[02:11:00]  Are you afraid of him  or you're not afraid  of any of those guys?  I'm not afraid of  anybody.  I'll fight anybody.  They want me to  fight, I'll fight.  You can ring with  anybody, yeah.  I got a shot with  everybody.  I have such a short  list of people I  would fight.  Such a short list.  He's like, are  anybody with two  legs?  I wouldn't want to  be in a bar and  go up to him and  say, I think I'm  next on the pool  table.  And then have him,  his next line is,  I'm not afraid of  anybody.  All right.  You know what?  Why don't you play  the next game?  Here's some quarters. 
[02:11:30]  Take my quarter.  You try to nod your  head towards the  chalkboard with your  name on it?  I mean, technically  I'm next, but you  know, I don't mind.  Hey, we got  Nicole Ritchie on  the line here.  Nicole, what's  going on?  How are you?  It's Opie and  Anthony.  We got Chuck Liddell  in studio from UFC  and Brian Regan.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Nicole.  Hi, Nicole.  Hi.  Wow, you've been in  the news lately?  Yeah.  For a couple of  reasons, one of  which is this 
[02:12:00]  pregnancy rumor.  Can we get that  out of the way?  You know, you  never believe  anything you read.  I don't really talk  about all that stuff,  but it's all  silly.  It's just, you  know, it's  ridiculous.  I got to be  honest.  I was hoping it  was true because  I think you're so  much hotter when  you're like chubby.  Thanks.  I think that you're  so much hotter when  you're chubby, too.  Never believe  anything you read,  so Lincoln was  not the president.  No.  Okay.  He defeated  Truman?  Now, another thing,  of course, the  Paris Hilton thing 
[02:12:30]  where she's in jail.  You spent a lot of  time with her,  filming your TV show.  Simple Life.  Simple Life.  And what do you  think?  Any opinion on  that?  You know, it's  obviously unfortunate,  and I'm really  proud of her for  taking responsibility  and doing what she  has to do.  Yeah, because there  was that falling  out.  And I'm just, you  know what I'm  going on?  I feel like an  ass even asking you  these things because  I would read them  and go, you know  something?  Why would anybody  get so deep into 
[02:13:00]  these rumor things?  And is Paris and  Nicole on the  outs?  Yeah, are they  on the outs?  We'll tell you  later.  And like, I  really wouldn't  care, but since  she's in jail,  you're a little  happy about it?  No, I'm not.  No, okay.  How was it  calling out Perez  Hilton?  Because I personally  don't like that  type of crap site.  And they said you  really had a  problem with him  or her, whatever  Perez is.  You know what?  I think that's  more, I don't 
[02:13:30]  necessarily have a  problem with him.  I don't even know  him.  I think that he  likes to think that  he has these  enemies and I  mean, I could care  less about him.  So, I mean, it's  more like I don't  care and he feels  like he has some  sort of rivalry with  me.  But, you know, I  really don't pay  attention to people  that just sit in  front of a computer  all day and are  obsessed with other  people's lives.  I think it's a  little bit pathetic.  What's the most  hurtful rumor about  you that you like  saw that you're  like, ugh, that  one sucks?  You know, any  rumor that I have  an eating disorder 
[02:14:00]  or anything like  that because, you  know, it's just not  true and I don't  want to send out  the wrong message.  Yeah.  Well, why'd you  lose all that weight?  I'm just naturally  thin.  Just wanted to.  Do you want to  ask some questions  or something?  Yeah, I have  something I have  just, I have to  ask you.  Of course, Lionel  Richie's daughter.  Love Lionel Richie.  Where is the big  clay head from the  hello video?  We have it,  actually.  You have it?  We have it, yeah. 
[02:14:30]  The big clay head.  The big clay head.  Do you think it  looks anything like  your father?  No, and I actually  don't like looking  at it.  And who made it?  Did that blind  girl actually make  it?  Because I would  only say a blind  girl could have  made that because  it looks nothing  like him.  I don't think she  made it and she's  actually not blind.  I actually recently,  well, not recently,  but about five years  ago recognized her.  I saw her in a  commercial, like a  Burger King commercial  or something, and I  was like, is that the  same girl that was in  the video?  That's the one that 
[02:15:00]  made your head, or  supposedly made the  head.  That's not a good  compliment for an  artist to ask, are you  blind?  Where do you keep the  head?  Where does your dad  keep the head?  He has like a  collection of stuff, so  I know I've seen it.  I don't know exactly  where in the house.  I would display it  right in the foyer,  right in the foyer,  right when you open  the huge doors.  Right when you walk  in.  Yeah, I'm sure your  father has this huge  entryway, and I would  put it in a big glass  case, just sitting 
[02:15:30]  there like the idol in  Indiana Jones, that big  clay head with the  giant, giant jaw and  the hair that looked  nothing like his.  I think he should  actually put it at the  gate, so before  Oh, that would be  good.  You're warned, like  this is what you're  walking into, you  know?  Or actually have it  tip back and have a  red button that he  pushes and a secret  panel opens up, like  Batman's house.  Or on a post at the  foot of the bed, so  it's just staring at  you all the time while  you're sleeping.  I would love to look  at a bust of my own 
[02:16:00]  head on the foot of  the bed.  Nicole, I've been  fascinated with the  clay head for years.  Loves it.  Yeah.  Does he dance on the  ceiling?  What?  Does he dance on the  ceiling?  Every night.  Every night.  So what are you  promoting?  Yeah, the Simple  Life goes to camp.  The Simple Life goes  to camp.  Is that Sundays at  10 o'clock?  Yeah.  On E.  When do you guys  premiere?  I'm sorry?  Oh, is it on  right?  Okay.  All right.  I didn't know.  Wow, that was one of  the worst plugs I've  ever heard.  I want to plug what 
[02:16:30]  she's calling for, but  it says Sundays at 10  o'clock on E, so I  didn't know.  And Nicole, you know  you carry that show,  right?  Thank you.  You know that,  right?  I hope you know  that.  Well, you know, we  both know.  I mean, Paris gets all  the attention.  She comes up with  cool stuff to keep  her name in the  press, but you  actually got the real  talent and carry the  Simple Life.  The Simple Life goes  to camp Sundays at  10 o'clock.  Now, Nicole?  Yes.  Now, if indeed you're not  pregnant, is that what  we're hearing now from  Nicole Richie?  I don't talk about that  stuff.  Well, here's what you 
[02:17:00]  ought to do.  If you're not, take the  big clay head and put it  under your dress and walk  around with that and to  screw with the press.  All right.  Perfect.  Love that clay head.  We're just a bunch of  asses.  Yeah, I know.  Figured it out, yeah.  All right.  Well, Nicole, the thing  is, are you going to be  watching The Ultimate  Fighter Season 5?  I wasn't planning on it.  Should I?  Absolutely.  You better.  Thursday's at 10 o'clock  on Spike, and, you know,  it's people of the same 
[02:17:30]  milk as, like, Chuck  Liddell and myself.  We have Chuck Liddell in  studio right here.  And, Chuck, I might say,  if you had a chin like that  big clay head, I think you'd  have stood up in that last  fight.  He took one to the chin and  went down, and it was  very hard to watch.  Yeah.  We like Chuck.  Nicole.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  These are all redundant  questions.  And statements that are  being made.  I think she's done with  it.  You don't even have to  chime in.  Not entertaining the whole 
[02:18:00]  pregnancy thing, though,  huh?  I'm sorry?  Damn, I wanted a scoop.  Yeah, we need a really  scoop.  Do you think page six is  going to write about the  clay head, Nicole, and the  information?  Clay head.  That's really interesting.  The big headline.  I think, listen, I give  you guys credit.  You guys are finally  talking about something  that no one else talks  about.  I know.  I personally get so sick  of people asking me the  same stupid questions over  and over again.  See?  I knew it.  That's why I wanted to  talk about that.  I could see.  It's going to say it on 
[02:18:30]  page six.  It's going to say,  Nicole Richie confirms  clay head at dad's house.  He does.  All right, Nicole.  Thanks for giving us a  call and continued success.  All right, you guys.  Thanks.  Tell your father I love  him and love the head.  And keep carrying that  show.  The Simple Life Goes to  Camp Sundays at 10 on E.  If you want, I'll try and  get a clay head made of  yours.  Oh, my God.  I would love that.  Get me a picture of the  clay head.  I will.  The sad part is she's not  even going to remember us  when she hangs out.  I know.  Oh, yes, she will.  She'll remember us every  time she sees that big 
[02:19:00]  clay head.  Stand out in my head.  All right, Nicole.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, you guys.  And we also got a plug.  We can't forget to plug a  couple of things.  We got Liddell here.  We got what exactly are you  plugging?  The Ultimate Fighting?  She's nice, Jimmy.  You stutter and mutter.  Well, look, you don't  want to screw that plug  up.  Regans, I don't care if I  screw up Regans.  I'll go, go ahead,  Brian, you do it.  This one you want to  handle properly.  Franklin's fighting on  the 16th out there.  The 23rd, I mean, BJ 
[02:19:30]  Penn's a good friend of  mine's fighting.  Yeah.  Jez Pulver, so.  Chuck, I don't know.  The final finale for  the show.  I don't know if you want  to talk about it, but I  got to get into it because  it made the press and  everything.  You might punch me in  the face, but that  interview where we saw a  video of it where you're  just like out of it.  What was that?  We played the audio on  our show.  And Jimmy laughed.  Jimmy laughed really  hard while we were  playing.  I loved it.  Hey, when I heard the  audio, I laughed, too.  You had to.  Hey, I didn't.  Look, I don't even  remember getting all  the way home. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, that home is,  I was in California,  and I was in Dallas.  Wow.  Yeah, so, I mean.  Well, you blacked out  through two time zones.  You know how great that is?  And the guy was  interviewing you, and he's  just like, um, are you  okay?  He started like asking  to be worried about  you.  Yeah, I should have  been.  It was just a late night  out?  No, I actually, I wasn't  out that late.  It was, uh, I had taken a  sleeping pill, and I was  sick, and I woke up three  hours later coughing.  I had pneumonia.  Oh, man.  I actually was in bed for  eight days after that.  My doctor was, I was 
[02:20:30]  talking to my doctor on  the phone.  I don't remember  talking to him, but he  said, I swear to him I  didn't have a fever, so  he told me, you gotta have  a fever, because it sounds  like you got pneumonia.  I said, I just, but he  came over, he's like, yeah.  But as soon as he walked  in, he was filming me, he's  like, yep, he got, he got  pneumonia, bro.  A fever?  You were talking like you  had malaria.  Yeah.  Yeah, I woke up, I woke up  about three hours after I  had taken a sleep pill, and I  took Michael to try and  stop, because I couldn't.  Michael!  Oh, my God!  I was stopping coughing.  That's what I picked up  for, Chuck. 
[02:21:00]  I don't even know why they  got me out of bed.  Yeah.  I must have been trying not  to get up.  I mean, I know I didn't  want to get up.  I know I don't like getting  up early in the morning  anyway, much less after I  been taking sleep pills.  Wow, he loved that audio,  though.  I want to see the rematch  between Sleeping Pills and  NyQuil, because that match,  I think NyQuil and Sleeping  Pills won also.  Oh, yeah, that one's good,  yeah.  But it was actually good.  It got me off the road. 
[02:21:30]  I was supposed to be on the  road for another couple  weeks.  Yeah, who knows, man?  I've been sick for probably  a month and a half.  I mean, three weeks before  that, Dana told me to go  home, get off the road,  just go see your doctor.  Yeah, wow.  And I'm sad.  Now I can keep going.  I can finish up everything  I said I'd do.  So, hey, it got to me.  I mean, I think the final  thing was getting to me was  I was doing a five-city  tour promoting the 300.  And it was 8 o'clock in the  morning doing radio stuff 
[02:22:00]  until about 1.  And then I'd fly somewhere  else doing a showing of it  and then supposed to go to  sleep.  And I don't sleep.  I don't get to sleep.  I can't sleep early.  So by the time I get to  sleep, it'll be about 3 or 4  in the morning.  They wake me up again at 8.  Oh, my God.  And start to be all over  again.  I did that five days in a row  in the fifth day.  You're shot.  I cracked.  You like being Chuck Liddell.  You can see that it's fun being  Liddell, man.  That's a cool...  He's like not a defeated guy.  Like you lost a fight, but you're  like the same guy you were the  last time you came in.  And it's like...  It's cool to say. 
[02:22:30]  I can't wait to fight.  I can't wait to fight again.  The only difference is I've  already started training again.  I'm ready to get back in the  ring.  First thing I want to do when  I've lost a fight is I just  want to get back in the ring.  Get back in.  Every other time I've lost,  I've come back and had long  streaks of wins.  You know, one of our fans is  on...  I've seen one more long  streak of wins so I can retire.  That's it.  One of our fans is on the  Ultimate Fighter Show.  Is he still in it?  Is he?  Yeah, one of the guys that's  on Whack Bag.  Really?  No, he became a helicopter.  I swear I read it.  No, a fan of our show.  One of our fans was on that 
[02:23:00]  show.  I'm not sure if he's still on  it, but...  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  We'll get off the air.  Yeah, we got to go.  Oh, Tom.  Chuck's website is  icemanmma.com.  icemanmma, which stands for  mixed martial arts, dot com.  And, Ryan, we want to make  sure we take care of you  too.  I want to plug Chuck's  webpage.  I want to take my time to  make sure Chuck is very  happy before he leaves the  studio.  I want Chuck to be happy.  Chuck will be savagely  beating Brian tomorrow 
[02:23:30]  night at the Westbury  Music Fair.  Hey, it is in the round.  You guys can go UFC.  You can do a little UFC  comedy thing out there.  Oh, this hurts.  I got those buzz for you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, we got to go.  We got to send him out to  you.  I forgot him.  He's reminded me to  bring him a mic.  Oh, thanks, man.  Old Buzzkill is taking a  look at us through the  other...  Buzzkill.  Tom, you come in and  tell him.  Yeah, why don't you...  Oh, all right.  Chuck, please knock him out.  Please.  It'll be the greatest  day of our careers.  What?  How are you doing?  Could you imagine...  Could you imagine  braces marks in his 
[02:24:00]  knuckles?  This is not heading  anywhere good.  What?  I said, we can go  where I bite him.  Yeah, no, that would  be great.  You punch him, he gets  braces marks in his  knuckles, and then Chuck  gets in trouble because  people thought he hit a  12-year-old.  Why are you talking to  the boss like that?  I don't know, because  we're still on the air.  The second the mics go  off, I kiss ass.  But Jimmy has a nice tie on  though, right?  He certainly does.  You look good, Tom.  I don't make fun of  Tom at all.  Yeah.  Absolutely not.  Not to his face.  Absolutely not.  Did that tie ever slip  through a glory hole? 
[02:24:30]  No?  Leave Tom alone.  He has the entire area  of Chelsea hanging off  his neck.  All right.  We'll get off the air.  Sorry, Tom, you're out.  All right.  So, the Ultimate Fighters  Season 5 is Thursdays  at 10 o'clock on Spike  and Regan.  Tonight you are going to  be in Albany, correct?  Albany tonight.  North Fork and Westbury  tomorrow night and Comedy  Central special, Sunday  night, 10 o'clock.  Sunday night, 10 o'clock.  And just one of the  greatest stand-ups, really.  Man, absolutely.  Great, great comic.  Jim, what a kind thing 
[02:25:00]  to say.  Thank you so much.  I said the greatest.  That's too childlike to go,  gee, you're the best.  I've got to tell him  that he's just...  Very nice.  Very, very cool.  Thank you.  It was awkward the first  time.  I figured I made it  awkward the second time.  What can I tell you?  And ticket special for  Jones Beach.  We'll announce that  tomorrow.  We'll announce that  tomorrow.  Yeah, we're very, very  busy.  Chuck Liddell, thank you  so much.  Thanks to Nicole Ritchie.  Thank you to Brian Regan.  And we'll see you guys  tomorrow.  Thanks, Opie and Anthony.  And Jimmy Norton.
