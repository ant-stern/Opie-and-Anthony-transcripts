<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a largely unrehearsed discussion.  A significant portion focused on their reactions to the Miss Universe pageant, featuring extensive, crude commentary on the contestants' appearances, particularly Miss Russia and Miss Vietnam.  This was interspersed with discussions about the show's loss in Syracuse due to a trade with Buffalo, resulting in anger and frustration over their financial losses in Citadel stock. They heavily criticized their replacement show, "Shut Up and Rock," hosted by Alexis, repeatedly playing and mocking audio clips of the program.  The hosts also discussed their experiences with the new iPhone and its applications, along with playing numerous repetitions of Lady Gaga's "Let's Just Dance."  Their regular producer, Jimmy, was present in studio.

The show continued with further outrage over their removal from Citadel stations and the perceived incompetence of "Shut Up and Rock," focusing heavily on mocking Alexis’s on-air persona.  This segment also included extended comedic dissection of audio clips from Boston Mayor Thomas Menino’s heavily slurred speech.  Other topics included a listener's dream about Denzel Washington and Desmond Tutu, Anthony's boasts about controlling his dreams to enact violence against women, rumors of the show's return to Philadelphia, a celebrity vacation list, angry listener calls regarding the Syracuse cancellation, and ideas for a more creative MLB Home Run Derby.  A brief discussion about a prior appearance by Joel McHale was included, with mention of him being a scheduled guest later in the show. The segment concluded with a "Fu Line" segment filled with angry listener messages.

A news segment about Abu Dhabi's massive spending sparked a tangent-filled discussion.  This involved joking about invading Venezuela (with trained falcons as a defense) and other countries to secure oil, discussing assassination and regime change, expressing disdain for electric cars, and comparing a reported $180,000 annual salary for a 24-year-old in Abu Dhabi to American salaries.  Joel McHale appeared as a guest, promoting his shows and discussing his experiences with a comedy club.  A caller shared a method for programming offensive GPS locations, and the hosts engaged in crude interactions with women in the studio audience.  A contentious phone call with a reporter about the iPhone launch also occurred, followed by a “Worst Lyrics Ever” segment mocking lyrics from Dolly Parton, Eminem, U2, and others.

A listener-submitted list of the 20 worst song lyrics prompted another extended segment featuring vulgar and offensive commentary on artists like Bob Marley, James Blunt, and Bob Seger, along with contributions from caller Waylon.  The hosts obsessed over Brad Pitt's physique using crude language, discussed a bra-shaped alcohol container, and used offensive language while discussing a news story about a family being kicked off a Southwest Airlines flight.  Danny and Steve were also present in the studio during this segment. The show concluded with a "Line of the Day" review, a discussion of the show’s organizational chaos, and the unexpected departure of the studio audience.  A brief technical issue with Jimmy Norton’s microphone was also noted.

[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Any other medium have to be nice.  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Pat, how's it going?  It's going quick.  Toward Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  All right, this is a bust, lesbians.  We're gonna smell all of your fingers.  If it smells like a day in the fishing hole, you're under arrest.  We're blithering idiots.  We're blithering idiots. 
[00:01:00]  That's fine.  No.  I love it.  It is C.  It is C.  It is C.  It is C.  I love you guys.  I'd suck all your **** up all day.  Wow.  Fine.  I think that's an endorsement.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Hi.  Welcome to a brand new week.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:01:30]  Of course.  We're your radio friends.  Who else would it be?  Hello, people.  Hi.  We're your radio friends.  You're friends.  You're friends.  You take us with you when you go to work.  Don't you?  By the way, your radio friends didn't prepare for this show today.  No, it was very little show prep going on in the office today.  Yeah.  Usually, we like sitting down, thumbing through the papers and commenting briefly because we  don't like talking too much about stuff. 
[00:02:00]  We like keeping it for the air.  Yeah.  So briefly, we might bring up a story or two or five or whatever that comes up in the  paper and look at the various news sites.  Drudge, FARC.  I know I like perusing those.  What about brief FARC, brief FARC, brief FARC, brief FARC?  Those asses.  I like going through that.  But today, none of that got accomplished.  Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let's just dance.  Oh, yeah.  Well, and I go to Anthony.  I think this Let's Just Dance song, maybe we can find it, is I'm guessing it's sweeping  the world as like some kind of club hit.  Well, it was last night.  Let's just dance.  We were just huddled, huddled around Opie's desk.  Well, I said, you have to see this.  Yeah.  And numerous times Opie will go, oh, you got to check this out. 
[00:03:00]  And it's one video that we might talk about on the air.  Back to our show prepping.  Yeah.  But this just didn't stop.  We had to watch the entire thing.  We pretty much watched the Miss Universe pageant from five to six this morning.  That's what we watched this morning.  Holy Jesus.  Because I drove home late from Philly last night and I was going to Betty by and I was  lucky enough to watch the swimsuit competition.  The perfect part.  With Lady Gaga singing Just Dance in the background. 
[00:03:30]  Lady Gaga.  That's who that was.  Lady Gaga's a freak.  And these one hot specimen after another.  I was waiting.  Let me tell you what I was waiting for so I could go back to my desk and continue with  the preparation for this fine program.  I was waiting for one even semi not good looking girl to come out.  It was ridiculous.  And then I would have sat down.  Yeah.  It didn't end.  It was a cavalcade of hotness.  Of hotness.  That's all it was.  I got to tell you too, we get home from Philly last night and I'm literally just laying 
[00:04:00]  in bed and my girl, she turns on the TV just like that.  She just hits power, drops the remote on the bed and walks out of the room to prepare  for Betty by.  Of course.  And you know, women, that could be at least an hour.  Girls can take a while there getting ready for bed.  So she comes in about 15 minutes later.  She goes, what are you watching?  Like you put it on.  I'm watching Lady Gaga.  I didn't even have to change the channel. 
[00:04:30]  Oh.  Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.  And it was just one hot chick after another stepping out with those friggin mile long legs.  Yeah.  And doing pretty fast walk down that catwalk into the, in front of the judges and audience.  Yeah.  Wow.  I got to turn Jimmy out to Lady Gaga.  You're going to want this on your iPod.  I'm telling you, Jimmy.  Oh, come on.  Listen to the Hulk.  Download it. 
[00:05:00]  Listen to the Hulk.  As you speak.  Yeah.  What the hell does that mean?  I don't know.  She's in the club.  All right.  Here comes the Hulk.  Get ready, Jay.  Come on.  Yeah.  Oh.  Anyway, we were watching.  Thinking of taking some poppers and having some gay sex for this. 
[00:05:30]  Wow.  Through a private glory hall somewhere on the upper east side.  You're walking into some guy's apartment.  There's just a piece of, a piece of wood with a rough hole in it.  Anyway, Miss Universe, fantastic.  I don't know who won.  I don't care.  It was just one hottie after another just parading out onto this stage.  You know why Miss Universe is so much hotter than any other pageant? 
[00:06:00]  They allow boobies in this competition.  Of course.  I think all the other competitions, they have to be flat, anorexic chicks.  Yeah.  They don't care about Miss Congeniality or if the woman can solve the world's problems  or anything else.  It's who is hot.  It's basically just boobies galore.  Did you see Miss Russia?  Holy mother of God.  Miss Russia was ridiculous.  She would break you.  I must break you.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Unbelievable.  She was making this sexy on the stage.  Making this sexy.  Just retarded.  Retardly hot.  And then you had Miss Japan.  Not looking Japan-ish.  Totally Japanese, no.  I think she had a little African in her.  Yeah.  Or at least her mom did.  Watch it.  Is it possible to have only a little African in you?  Oh, stop it now. 
[00:07:00]  Watch it.  Yeah, she had booty on her and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could comment on every single one of these girls that walked out.  And then you had...  It destroyed our show prep.  And then you had Miss Mexico not looking Mexico-ian.  Mexico-ian.  She didn't look Mexico-ian.  Because when these broads came out, you're just thinking the stereotypical broad from that  country.  I was thinking the girls you see that you have to send change to to feed.  Right.  And they show on TV. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that wasn't what she looked like in the Miss Universe pageant.  Miss Vietnam?  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Had a hell of a boutique.  Yes.  How did that happen?  Not quite the girl that was dropped off on the motorcycle in a full metal jacket.  No.  No.  To help out the boys.  Too beaucoup.  Unbelievable.  And I guess Miss, what, Venezuela won?  Miss Venezuela won.  Oh, my God.  The second runner-up was Miss Columbia.  E-Rock just found more pictures of Russia. 
[00:08:00]  The first runner-up.  Look at this.  Is that her?  Look at this specimen.  I thought she had lighter hair.  Maybe for the competition, I think.  Yeah.  Go to the photos.  Jesus Christ.  Of Miss Russia.  Vera Krasa.  Vera Krasa.  Vera Krasa.  Vera Krasa.  Wow.  Even the chick from the Czech Republic and Hungary.  Yeah.  They were, like, hot.  Yeah.  They found the only hot chicks there without big hairy moles on their face.  And put them in the contest.  Look at this.  Look at that.  Look at this thing. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  It's beyond reason.  She comes bouncing on the stage with just these big, heavy, heavy.  Heavy.  Heavy.  But not saggy.  No.  Unbelievable.  They were wonderful.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker, what's up, buddy?  Stryker?  Stryker?  What are you doing?  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  Okay, cool.  What's up, Stryker?  Stryker.  I'm curious if anybody happened to see the midget in the audience. 
[00:09:00]  When they were introducing the judges last night, there were two midgets in the audience  right behind the one judge.  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  I don't remember which judge it was, but as they were going down the line and the camera  panned on them, it was like there was two midgets sitting behind the judge.  The contest took place in Vietnam.  Yeah.  Which was, you know, odd.  Yeah.  Well, these were definitely Asian-looking midgets.  Okay.  So maybe, you know, because the midgets here in the United States- 
[00:09:30]  Are real midgets.  Real midgets.  And they're a dying breed.  No.  You don't see as many as you used to.  I know growing up, I saw a lot more midgets, even in school and everything.  But maybe in Vietnam, there's still just a lot of midgets.  Yeah, probably.  We don't know worldwide what the midget count is.  I don't think we fixed their water yet, so.  Yeah, something in the water.  Anything's possible.  Anything's possible.  All that Agent Orange we dropped over there.  I don't know if that had any effect. 
[00:10:00]  Do you think midgets noticed that the better DNA research gets, the less of them they see?  How insulting is that?  Yes, we're trying to weed you out, is really what we're doing here, through better genetic testing.  Well, and in the midget community, if you try to make yourself taller or any of that stuff, you are looked, quote, down upon.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  They get pissed off.  They're like, what's wrong with being a midget?  They get really mad.  Like, I'll be looking down upon you once the surgery's done. 
[00:10:30]  That's right.  And jackass.  Yeah, but then you just look like you're walking on stilts the whole time.  That's true.  It's like flesh stilts they have.  Because the longing of the bones, they try to stretch out the bones.  They try to stretch the bones out and try to get those weird twisted baby legs all straightened out.  It's awful.  They don't have to get to the movies early to sit in the front row anymore.  No.  Awful little lives.  Nice calves.  I mean, it's just big calves.  They're hauling such little teeny packages.  I know. 
[00:11:00]  It's just a small little fella.  That is interesting that the better genetic testing gets the fewer of them.  Oh, yeah.  That really can't make you feel good.  No.  Hey, where's a lot of other people that look like me?  I mean, science has found a way to eliminate them.  Yeah.  So long, shorty.  Oh, is that fantastic?  But so Vietnam.  That's just such an odd thing that you look back pre 1975.  There we are fighting in Vietnam.  Not me personally.  I use the, you know, we meaning this country, of course, fighting Vietnam. 
[00:11:30]  And then you fast forward here.  Ah, we're having hot babes walking on the stage in Vietnam.  The hottest, too.  I mean, Miss Vietnam was smoking.  They should have set the whole contest up like that scene in Apocalypse where the Playboy  helicopter comes down.  Yeah, right on.  That would have been a little more Vietnam-y.  I thought they were like trying out to be in Playboy or something.  Not even a joke there, really.  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  They make it so much hotter, this Miss Universe contest. 
[00:12:00]  The swimsuits are much smaller.  The girls are allowed to grow boobies.  Who's that?  Just another ridiculous specimen.  Who's this?  Miss Venezuela.  That's Venezuela.  That's the one that won.  Yeah.  I didn't think she was the hottest one, but maybe she looked better in a gown or something.  I don't know.  How do they?  The hottest one out of that bevy.  And I'm also watching this thing and I'm hearing the announcer and I'm going, wow,  who's the gay guy doing the Miss Universe?  Right, yeah.  And all of a sudden, Jerry Springer will be back with the Miss. 
[00:12:30]  What happened to his voice?  When he yells, he sounds gay.  I don't know why.  The stereotypical gay, you know.  We still deal with stereotypes on this show.  Sorry, but we do.  It's the gay dialect.  Right.  You've heard it.  Everyone knows it exists.  Stop.  It's this thing.  Unless you didn't know.  But yeah, he kind of had a very gay sound to him.  I don't know why.  But I didn't even know that was on last night.  So I want to thank my girl for just happening to turn on. 
[00:13:00]  What channel was it that?  I really don't.  Oh, NBC.  Because I remember seeing the Olympic logo.  Because I didn't even hear about it being advertised or anything.  No, it just was on.  Thank God for YouTube, though.  Man.  We're just able to, like we said, huddle, huddle around.  Hope he's asking.  Usually we all go back to our workstations.  I was cursing.  Not today.  I was cursing YouTube this morning because you really needed better quality to see just 
[00:13:30]  how ridiculous these women are.  That's got to get better.  Yeah, that'll be the next stage.  I mean, that'll be the next stage.  Remember, I mean, come on.  Just a few years back, you couldn't even see video.  No.  It was awful.  But yeah, there's so many videos on there.  That seems to be the problem, but they really do have to step it up.  At least take that and give it a little more bandwidth.  Take videos like that.  We'll be the judge of what gets more bandwidth.  Yeah.  I think everyone will agree.  So how was everyone's weekend? 
[00:14:00]  Weekendy.  Weekendy.  Mmm.  Weekendy.  Contailed sleep, which was good.  Oh, yeah.  We negotiated a deal and some people are finding out that they're on the wrong end of the deal.  Really?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Syracuse.  Ryan.  What's up?  How are you, Ryan?  Not too good.  What happened to you guys, man?  What happened?  We're not on in Syracuse anymore.  Why?  And the phones are lit with Syracuse phone calls and Syracuse instant feedback. 
[00:14:30]  Instant feedback.  But Citadel's claiming we weren't doing well in Syracuse.  I don't really understand.  What?  But we were able to negotiate, you know, Buffalo for Syracuse.  We did a little trade in the radio world.  Keep us on it, Buffalo.  We'll give you Syracuse.  What the hell?  Nah.  You guys should get rid of Buffalo and come back to Syracuse.  So we had a nice following in Syracuse.  We were getting phone calls from you guys every morning. 
[00:15:00]  People loving the show.  Yeah.  Instant feedback, the emails, but I don't know.  Oh, that sucks.  I don't know what's going on with this Citadel company.  Well, how about I renegotiate my stocks?  Yeah.  That are down to 89 cents or whatever it is.  What is it down to?  89?  I wish it was 89.  It's like 87.  Did it go down again?  Remember that fine IPO that our old pal Fareed?  $19 a share we got in on.  That's right, baby.  $19.  On the ground floor.  It was an IPO, initial public offering that we were in on. 
[00:15:30]  We were privy to get in before any other traders could get in.  And we bought up Citadel stock a couple of years back now at $19 a share.  That's right.  Feeling good.  Because it was going to shoot up to, it had a double in no time.  Yeah.  Fareed said it would.  Oh, boy.  What is the stock at right now?  83 cents a share.  83 cents and you take us off of Syracuse, you sons of bitches. 
[00:16:00]  Come on.  Oh, they're bitching about money.  I'm like, look, look, not my problem.  Look, let me tell you something.  I have no problem saying it.  I have lost.  I'm ready to tell you.  Yeah.  I have lost $100,000.  Thank you.  With this stupid stock.  Thank you.  Keep us on in Syracuse.  Yeah.  We're basically working for free for you already.  We just forked over $200,000.  The Opie and Anthony show gave you $200,000. 
[00:16:30]  Keep us on in Syracuse.  So leave us on.  You sons of bitches.  What you know about me is I worked an hour north of Syracuse and you guys cut out about  45 minutes north of Syracuse and I sucked.  Yeah, well.  I sucked big time.  And I wish you guys would just do all of New York State.  Well, we were planning on that.  We had Buffalo.  We have Rochester.  We had Syracuse.  Now we don't have Syracuse.  Yeah.  There's a big hole in the middle of New York.  There's a way you can hear us, Ryan. 
[00:17:00]  Get XM.  I know.  What?  What's XM?  We don't even know what XM is at this point.  What do we got left at XM?  70 some odd days?  Actually, do you own an iPhone?  Well, technically, yes.  I have the AT&T Tilt.  Well, can you get Apple apps?  Can you get the apps that are available, the applications for the iPhone?  What the hell is an app?  Oh, we have to get into that.  All right.  We'll talk about apps.  I downloaded mine.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  We'll talk about the new iPhone that came out.  And I went into the Apple store and gave it a little review prior to me thinking of purchasing  it.  Did I purchase it or didn't I?  I'll let you know after the break.  This reminds me of my new bit that I came up with about what's the apps.  Oh, wait a minute now.  I don't think you should.  What?  That sounds familiar.  What's the apps?  About the applications, yeah.  I think somebody might get upset with the name of your new bit. 
[00:18:00]  Maybe Steve Jobs, but if I want to talk about applications, I will.  What's the apps?  What's the apps?  That sounds a lot like somebody else's bit.  What are we going to do with Syracuse?  Because everyone is really not happy.  There's some feedback.  They're all discovering that we're not on this morning.  What are they playing in our place?  Yeah.  What are they playing in our place?  Just music right now.  Nothing.  Oh, by the way, Ryan, hold on a line.  I'm going to put you on with Brandon in Buffalo. 
[00:18:30]  Brandon.  Yo.  Hey, buddy.  How are you?  All right.  How are you guys doing?  Well, we negotiated a backroom deal.  We traded in Syracuse to stay on in Buffalo.  Well, I'm glad to hear it.  I'm not even kidding.  For anyone listening in Buffalo, wow, it was getting close that we weren't going to be  on this morning in Buffalo.  We were able to make this backroom deal.  We had to give up Syracuse, though.  This is how desperate the radio world is these days.  For a city to be named later. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, actually, we do have a city to be named later.  We have to name that later.  Does it rhyme with Paws Angeles?  The Citadel.  I love that rhyme joke.  The Citadel, they're in a desperate situation, so we have to suffer.  We have to suffer.  You suffered already.  Get your stupid stock price up and leave us in our cities then.  I want my money back.  But, Brandon, what's going on? 
[00:19:30]  Say hi to Syracuse, who lost us this morning.  Oh, I will.  I will say hi.  And I don't know, man.  I'm just happy you guys are still on.  It sucks for Syracuse, but what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do, Ryan?  Sorry.  Sucks to be you.  What can I tell you?  Well, you need to talk to your bosses and tell them to get your asses back on in Syracuse  because you've got a lot of unhappy people.  Well, I'm getting that feeling today.  The phones are lit.  The instant feedback lit, but I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:20:00]  I'm going to have to start using my internet on my phone a little bit more  and get you guys on my phone instead.  All right, buddy.  Well, that's where it's all going anyway.  So, who gives a crap in the end?  I'm watching out.  Have a great morning.  Maybe we'll hear you soon.  All right, Ryan.  Thank you.  Brandon.  Yo.  Get the word out, man.  We barely survived Buffalo this morning.  You know, I tried to.  I turned a couple people on to you guys, my brother being one of them, and I don't know. 
[00:20:30]  I'm surprised that not as many people I knew didn't listen to you guys.  I don't know how people couldn't.  Yeah.  All right.  No, no.  We're, I can't even say what's going on in Buffalo.  We're actually doing very well in the ratings, but there's something else going on and blah,  blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  I see.  What's going on?  Can you whisper it?  All right.  I got ahead to work.  Whisper it.  Oh, this is wonderful.  Thank you, Brandon.  Uh, they replaced us with something called Shut Up and Rock. 
[00:21:00]  That, that's good.  All right.  Thank you, Citadel.  Shut Up and Rock.  Thank you.  That's what replaced us in Syracuse.  I'd love to be the host of Shut Up and Rock.  It's a chick and the show's called Shut Up and Rock.  Oh, that's wonderful.  That is, you know, if you're in radio and you're hosting a show called Shut Up and Rock.  That's wonderful.  You, you, you've done nothing with your career.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Well, although she's, she's doing live traffic and weather.  The only thing worse than being the host of Shut Up and Rock is being replaced by it. 
[00:21:30]  Yes, exactly.  That, yes.  See, the phones are just lit.  AJ, Syracuse, what's up, buddy?  She makes me want to shut up and puke.  Yeah, well, we were, we were replaced by Shut Up and Rock.  I guess that's going to be sweeping the country.  Yeah, it is sweeping the country.  It's called iPods.  How about Shut Up and f*** me?  I turned on the radio this morning and you guys aren't on.  Yeah, we already have Shut Up and Rock.  It's iPods.  Yeah.  It's everything else. 
[00:22:00]  It's everything that's available to everybody.  That's Shut Up and Rock.  Yeah.  You want Shut Up and Rock?  I'll put my headphones on.  I'll put my, my iPod.  Yeah.  iPhone.  Yeah.  And listen to music.  That'll get ratings up.  Shut Up and Rock.  How come you're not on K-Rock down here?  Where?  There's a K-Rock in Syracuse?  Yeah.  Well, we'll be making some phone calls.  100.9.  All right.  We'll look into it.  Thank you, AJ.  Wasn't scorched there?  Hey, can we go to a break with some more radio, Lady Gaga? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, okay.  Lady Gaga?  Yeah, Lady Gaga.  We're going to be from Rock to Lady Gaga.  Yeah, we're going to be.  That's right.  Shut up and have gay sex with each other to this music.  Maybe it's a morning duo.  Sure.  Yeah.  Rocco is saying maybe it's a morning duo.  His name is Shut Up and her name is Rock.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it could be.  Hey, we're Shut Up and Rock.  Why don't we just change our names to Shut Up and Rock?  Shut Up and Rock.  And everything stays the same.  Nice. 
[00:23:00]  Ah, this radio business.  They are lost, my friends.  All right.  We go to break with Lady Gaga.  I'm feeling good.  You like it, right, Jimmy?  I do.  It's catchy.

[00:25:00]  i love you oh that too a buddy of mine came back from london said stop your wine and it's nine dollars  and sixty cents a gallon yeah well they their money's worth twice as much as ours he said that's  with the conversion no way yeah so it's fifty dollars a gallon wait what  yeah but how far do they drive jeez stupid little island we used to be a privileged country let  everyone else pay those outrageous gas prices not anymore my friend well that's because england's a 
[00:25:30]  little country that has no oil wells or a few of them i don't even know do they and how far  do you and how far do you really drive your car within an hour you could visit seven countries  exactly that's just stupid and you take the underground and then you take the chunnel don't  forget to mind the gap whatever that means the chunnel but this country jesus i just don't like the  speed at which it it went up it went from you know a year ago we're paying uh it was 39 cents a gallon 
[00:26:00]  i remember i could fill up for five bucks we're up a dollar 19 in a year see that's silly 30 percent  35 percent increase it's crazy yeah it went up like this uh 285 a gallon 295 three dollars  yeah every time i fill up now it's over a hundred dollars that's just stupid it's over a hundred bucks 
[00:26:30]  every time i fill up yeah i get a little down on the the gas thing and the little thing  bing comes on says low fuel i know it's i know it's a hundred bucks you know what's pissing me  off because i think more and more people are seeing this this dubai they're laughing at us  they're basically saying we love middle class america's money oh don't they now we're gonna  make a smiley face island with their money and then they buy up everything uh that's what they call  dubai i think they just buy up everything in this country i'm going to they just buy the chrysler 
[00:27:00]  building i'm going to uh i messed up the joke yeah i'm gonna dubai you yeah dubai dubai  uh that weird saudi arabia they're just laughing they're just they just got truckloads of uh of uh  the middle class's money i was i was having a conversation uh last night with uh one of my  uncles and uh one of his uh sons uh about the whole is this the end of an empire you know we wouldn't 
[00:27:30]  know we'd just kind of muddle through as the market crashes and and fuel prices soar and our our uh the  way we look in the world is just awful yeah and uh you know empire's end i'm sure the romans thought  everything was hunky dory right up until the end it wasn't so hunky no it's just like i don't know  we're in such a weird time right now what a drunken conversation that must have been oh it was awful  what are we doing here was this i mean is there any way we can salvage our country back 
[00:28:00]  was it in between shovelfuls shovelfuls you know shallow graves who the hell uh did you wrong who  are you burying this weekend no not one of those uncles oh you are italian i mean come on oh it was  uh uncle joe someone was saying what drinking someone was saying when we start on xm which is  almost four years ago wow uh you anthony were bitching about gas being just over two dollars a 
[00:28:30]  gallon is that possible yeah because it was like one dollar and it was like it will it break the two  dollar mark we used to remember everybody was like is it going to break the two dollars a gallon mark  it can't possibly go that high now four dollars and change and yeah five bucks let's say hi to  marcus in syracuse uh marcus hi marcus hey guys uh were you uh what happened in syracuse where you  guys are on the radio this morning well they replaced us with shut up and rock and when i see 
[00:29:00]  shut up i'm gonna punch him in the face oh all right yeah i don't know what to tell you marcus but  uh citadel because they're just such a wonderful radio company with their 83 cents a share stock  uh jesus negotiated with us 83 83 cents a share and they're taking us off syracuse from a 19  dollar ipo but it's 83 cents why don't you just hand it to people that's the type of thing you 
[00:29:30]  throw in someone's like little pumpkin on halloween what is this trick or treat that's what i'm gonna  do i'm gonna get one share stock certificates for all the stock i own oh wow and just hand them out  on halloween and really make it hurt give them a mary jane bar too one mary jane bar and some candy  corn and one share of one share of of shitty dell stock  that sure is what we've been calling it 
[00:30:00]  obi obi said he calls it adele yeah instead of citadel it's adele i think they have bigger  problems than taking us off in syracuse i mean come on i know and all i got is syracuse phone calls i you  know we do have an audience it was growing you dopes yep i don't at this point i don't even care  we're literally less than a year away from you just picking out what radio show you want to 
[00:30:30]  listen to in america and and and listen to it exactly oh they just showed miss miss america  miss usa falling down yeah you clumsy ox how does she do it again sorry marcus  there she goes yeah she smiles yeah it gets up claps and but you could see in her face she's like  god damn it i fell oh poor lady oh she's like whoa they're showing it about 15 times on this hack  news station cw11 here in new york who makes her shoes how does she keep falling they make one longer 
[00:31:00]  dudley moore she's wearing dudley moore's club foot shoe he had a club foot she keeps falling  hobson won't help her up help me up hobson i seem to have fallen again  look i fell on the stage isn't that funny  i've got a club foot and a pudding head didn't he get the old pudding head 
[00:31:30]  you bet he did you bet he did yeah he got some bizarre disease and was not only a movie it was  his iq right before he went  he had a little softball thing in the head  uh okay thank you  i know what country was this in by the way  vietnam okay  yes don't make us play let's dance again vietnam i actually just looked at mrs 
[00:32:00]  venezuelan said she's pretty man like i made a discovery she's pretty  yeah i've had enough of this miss america falling down miss usa is a clod  that was a good one when rachel smith fell that was uh like last year she fell flat on her ass  these are the guys laughing at the runway model falling down yeah they played it over and over 
[00:32:30]  the clip where they we just isolated the laughing part but the this clip with the commentary is one  of my favorite clips ever because they're all like people love watching hot girls fall down  of course they just love it you ever see a girl wearing heels and she just she's walking down the  street here in manhattan or any anywhere any big city looking all hot and then her ankle just twists  out from under her and she falls it's hysterical here we go ready for this okay um 1950 right this 
[00:33:00]  will go fast don't worry 26.8 cents per gallon wow all right all right that's so you could go  cruising 1960 30.4 cents per gallon my god now we get into the categories where like our listeners  were alive 1975 75 uh just before the carter administration right carter came in in 76 right 
[00:33:30]  yep uh 53.5 cents per gallon 53 cents you should be able to ask for like a dollar give me a dollar  sure regular we should find out what minimum wage was then too because like what's the relative  comparison 250 so it was like a fifth minimum wage was it i don't know 2050 cents i mean you get the  point here 1981 a lot of us can remember 1981 right right sure i was four a dollar 19 per gallon 
[00:34:00]  it broke that dollar mark that was a big boundary when people said oh is gas going to go over a dollar  a gallon is that right yeah 1998 yeah all right so 1981 is a dollar 19 a gallon ready 1998 that's when  we uh moved back to new york and started doing uh radio in new york city right yes a mere 10 years ago  it was a dollar five it actually went down from 1981 wow a dollar five when we when we when we 
[00:34:30]  started up at any w 10 years ago 2004 when we were uh sitting out for a while oh no when we finally  came back yeah when we finally came back to radio it was uh a dollar 95 it stayed in that dollar range  for quite a while and then 2006 it was two dollars and 57 cents and now we're paying for i think the  national average is 417 4 15 somewhere around yeah what happened what happened during that time 
[00:35:00]  hmm i don't know instability in the middle east what happened i ran um bush iraq bush china and india  bush bush bush china and india becoming industrialized bush more demand they still got the supply over  there but they won't pump up the volume and uh and uh pump out more oil and we won't drill 
[00:35:30]  drill alaska i've said it before i don't care if polar bears turn black i don't care if they're all  just covered in soot and oil i really don't all right hey you could go to a zoo and see a nice  pristine white polar bear well there how many people have seen polar bears in the wild in alaska  exactly not me just a few of our listeners they were i would say one of those alaska cruises 
[00:36:00]  hey uh what's up with the apps oh what's the apps what's the apps new bit that i would come up with  it's about the new mac applications and anthony certainly has them for uh your iphone the iphone  um well everybody knows the uh the new iphone came out the second generation iphone came out  and for uh the people that have the standard iphone that they paid an arm and a leg for when it first  came out we went up to version 2.0 which uh upgraded it to exactly the same thing that the new iphone does 
[00:36:30]  except it doesn't have the 3g technology um for the faster internet downloads and uh whatnot data  uh that's about it everything else you have you also don't have the gps but with the cell tower  triangulation you can get pretty close that's pretty much what i use when you just hit where you are and  it'll show you on google maps where you are whether you have gps or not uh i downloaded a few apps 
[00:37:00]  short for applications because uh with the upgrade came a little icon on the front of your phone that  says uh app store so you go to your app store and you can download different apps can i can i app with  my blackberry you cannot app with my blackberry you can't say what's the apps what's wrong with my  blackberry someone's upset with this uh bit what's not actually a bit it's a segment what's wrong 
[00:37:30]  young sam what's wrong with you sam what's the matter i don't think this should be called what's  the apps let's just call it tech talk with ona no because it's about it's about applications it's  it's i think it's a strictly strictly about apps all right see this is the brilliance of jim noren  instead of a hacky little dumb like name like you just came up with jimmy comes up with a creative  way yeah i create what's the apps all right well you're what's the apps kids i have i have a segment

[00:48:30]  kind of side by side tested it and with the new upgrade for the old iphone yeah it was no the new  one where it wasn't much better than what i have right here we did a speed test in there because  travis has the new iphone and we went to a cnn.com and hit go right at the same time and it was like  this travis went i got it and i went i got it it was that fast that the pages downloaded at the  same time i was on regular just the regular crappy so you're not gonna buy the new iphone

[01:04:00]  enjoying it all right well i'll tell you my dream it's very brief sure it's not very interesting but  it's weird okay i dreamt i was at the comedy cellar waiting to go on and denzel washington came in  but he looked much older and he knew me because we had done a project together oh no but i didn't  recognize like i knew i recognized him but i didn't know what project and so we're talking and  he's like yeah and like i knew he knew me and liked me but i couldn't remember what we'd worked on  together i wanted to get a fan picture with him but i didn't know how to ask him without being a fan 
[01:04:30]  yeah he knows me right and uh i don't remember what happened then but then desmond tutu  desmond tutu came up and asked me to get him a picture with denzel washington that's my whole  dream i don't know what it means i have no idea what that wow you're very diverse in your dreams  idiotic diversity that rules that is silly what does it mean desmond tutu ever have those desmond  tutu yeah ever have those dreams where like uh you have your like best friends with like a just a 
[01:05:00]  uber like hollywood star or somebody yeah and then you're waking up realizing it was just a dream  and you get really depressed i thought that was my friend i thought i was in i dreamt about carlin  being my friend recently i dreamt about denzel and i dreamt about spike lee the other night i just  dreamt i was doing a project with him did i ever tell you what i do when i think i did mention this  what i do when i know i'm dreaming the second i'm in a dream and i go oh my god i'm dreaming 
[01:05:30]  drill a buddy booth it's close no because sometimes you're dreaming and then you look around and go  wow this is so effed up and then in your dream you go oh my god i'm dreaming i run around and  molest and rape any woman that's in the dream around me you've told us that but that's impossible  you can't control your dreams that way can no no i can i go oh my god you got some kind of superpower  so i just i start ripping clothes off i'm just jamming i'm doing awful horrible things but then i 
[01:06:00]  usually wake up at that point like because i'm so i'm like really in a pretty excitable state yeah  at that point who can't wait for the one time when anthony's doing this and all of a sudden he's  standing there and the police come i can't wake up i can't wake up i'm not what do you mean i'm not  dreaming there's a woman there with no underpants crying and pointing at me but wait a minute  no officer this is a dream don't worry yeah no that believe me i know the difference and i don't 
[01:06:30]  do it because that's what i want to do in real life it's just that it's a dream so you get the  opportunity to do things that uh you know you can't do and obviously that's one of them nice let's say  hi to mark mark hey what's going on guys hey mark hey i was uh seeing what's going on with you  guys in ysp i got a uh google alert on you guys last night from philly.com and uh there are rumors  going around that you were coming back to philly but someone from ysp said it isn't true apparently 
[01:07:00]  well obviously that someone's not in the know my friend they don't even have a management team in  place so who is this person that would deny such a rumor i don't know that's all that philly.com  it's a nameless faceless person saying it's not true but what do they know my friend who are they  you just stay tuned in philly yeah but you guys need to get back on there because i'm tired of  hearing the guy with the list every morning all right i don't even know who that is i have no idea  i think it's uh frank lario or something like that all right great has a show on ysp yeah 
[01:07:30]  let's go to bill and of course syracuse yeah you guys are out of syracuse now oh brother oh yeah  citadel thinks they uh have something else uh they'd rather have in our place called a show called shut  up in rock we got a big fat broad name alexis and they call her alexis because she looks like a  lexus and not a nice one is that her name it's not good it's not that she sounds all cute and hot  on the radio you get in person and she wouldn't fit in alexis hey uh there bill uh weren't you

[01:09:30]  shutting up if it rocks it's on 95x shut up and rock mornings and i tell you something  if it rocks it's on a lot of rock stations yeah  radio slogans stink unless you come up with one that you know it hasn't been done before if it rocks  it's on rock stations anthony and i used to work at the only station that really rocks yeah was it  every time we had to say that we're like rolling our eyes like we're the only station that really 
[01:10:00]  rocks there's three other stations in this town playing the same crap we are why why are we special  we could turn it up a little higher one of many stations that rocks right roll off the tongue  it's just more just it means nothing crap that radio has become there's no creativity if it rocks it's  what no if it rocks it's probably on a thousand other rock stations across america if it rocks it's  on 95x shut up and rock mornings and 95x and a british travel company actually put together a 
[01:10:30]  celebrity list of most people that uh people would want to go on vacation with and number nine is daniel  craig that would be the new uh double oh seven holy mother of god holy mother of baby jesus it's just  gonna do a list with no commenting this is a list see when we do lists we we try to have fun with it  and get a few jokes out you don't just read a list we hate lists by the way the list of of celebrities 
[01:11:00]  you'd want to go on vacation with well james bond great any reason and any and now any comment  how about a line after you after you say that let's go to hubba hubba let's go to peter in syracuse  top three celebrities the group hansen is a group marty feldman and sirhan sirhan your turn  see how jimmy just made that funny without even trying truthful yeah sirhan sirhan let's go to peter  in syracuse peter hey what's going on hey peter this is ridiculous are you serious have you heard 
[01:11:30]  this girl's voice well you know we like to think we're the greatest thing in radio we understand that  might not be completely accurate but when when they take us off like a market then you're sitting  there going of course we're gonna like wonder what they replaced us i would hope it's a powerhouse and  we're thinking oh what they've replaced us to go political talk and they got rush limbaugh in our  place yeah sean hannity in our place uh-huh not a show called shut up and rock where um i'm like oh my 
[01:12:00]  god it's a hole what it was what was that just cheaper is that what it comes down to yeah well  apparently yeah you're paying the chances of you guys coming back oh good oh just wonderful after  the the last hour of radio after yeah at this point we're probably going to be taking off all  all citadel stations because they don't like when you talk bad about them well you guys are awesome  no we were awesome i want my 19 a share what happened right or i want at least an explanation 
[01:12:30]  as to why it is 83 cents right all right thank you peter sorry but uh enjoy shut up and rock  speaking of which all right so this is what she's doing now if it rocks it's on 95x shut up and rock  mornings on 95x and a british travel company actually put together a celebrity list of most people that  uh people would want to go on vacation with and number nine is daniel craig that would be the new  uh double oh seven uh let's see hugh laurie is on the list angela jolie is on the list madonna's at 
[01:13:00]  number angela jolie presidential uh nominee uh obama is on the list number three going vacation with  him george cloney is number one on the list so if uh i don't know i don't think i'd pick any of these  people i don't know who i'd put on my list but there would be somebody ted bundy i don't know who i'd  put on the list but it would be somebody this woman really look at what she's saying here 
[01:13:30]  she doesn't agree with the list she does a whole list and she says i wouldn't go on vacation with  any of these people and then you would assume being a dopey radio person she'd have our top  three right well i would bring like jimmy said and then maybe you go with some goof names or maybe some  real names i don't know you have some way to finish this off and then she finishes it off with  what what'd she say that she doesn't play it again i only only she could sound this stupid  she's improving just how i taught her yes it's wonderful she doesn't know who i would put on 
[01:14:00]  the list but it would be somebody it would be somebody right that's what you get from this hole  the top three i'd bring are bob kelly there you go like a fat joke here's how she ended it  arch colonie is number one on the list so if uh i don't know i don't think i'd pick any of these  people i don't know who i'd put on my list but there would be somebody what was she doing of  course did she not do radio maybe it can't sound like she was she was she was bored up she was 
[01:14:30]  digging out teeth getting them ready for root canals that's what she was doing an intern i i think she  was actually doing the 9 a.m shift yeah after uh great wow after us yeah fourth hour must have  been great great fantastic shut up and rock i don't know you gotta get us more shut up and rock  that's all i want to hear today is that her yeah tilting your head is gonna make you look hotter  what is that about it looks like an 80s glamour shot myspace voodoo going on just because you tilt

[01:31:30]  bread just a lot all right we gotta take a break we got more mayor menino audio clips after the  break we got more shut up and rock audio but how is that possible if you're supposed to be rocking  how are we able to play shut up and rock audio i don't get it and then uh we got joel mccale from  uh the soup they still call it the soup on e why why why is he coming in he was uh with us uh just  friday no that was like a fake appearance he wasn't supposed to be on friday two words right poor guy 
[01:32:00]  we did that hypnotist thing oh my god i tried to forget about that all weekend that was a magical  segment surely was patty took us to her life in real time and then opie anthony opie anthony  jimmy hellboy two uh number one at the box office what hancock number two yeah and uh the only reason  we're doing this eddie murphy's meet dave yeah we're eddie murphy's eddie murphy in eddie murphy 
[01:32:30]  debuted at number seven only 5.3 million wow dollars made yikes yeah yeah yeah i don't see  that picking picking up uh anytime soon we got the all-star game here in new york city and uh  very disappointed in our fine city by the way very disappointed they got the home run derby tonight  yeah i need to quit radio i gotta become the mayor because i could do cool stuff for this city yeah 
[01:33:00]  like well like the home run derby which is tonight yeah when you think home run derby  you think lots of home runs at a stadium sure boring home run derby from the brooklyn bridge  let's get it done people and then what how cool would that be i'm not even joking  like they're on the bridge dude why can't we think differently than the other cities out there we got  the all-star game home run derby it's the same thing every year it's pretty exciting obviously 
[01:33:30]  but why don't we like really get it excited how about on the top of the empire state building  oh okay just tell everyone they you know they have to look out below right what all right so that  one can't work too well but how about from the brooklyn bridge i'm dead serious and then what we  like logistically how would you do that you turn it into like who could hit it the furthest or  something just change it up but but uh like where would the pitch come from are you are you firing  off the side of the bridge you might have straight away down the bridge maybe you have to build some 
[01:34:00]  kind of you know platform or something for the pitcher i don't know and then you get barges with fans  on both sides but just in that area alone people on the shoreline would check it out and maybe you  let them on the bridge as well that's a home run derby that would be cool as hell it's uh  interesting but seriously why not do something you know completely off the charts with the home  run derby maybe just do it balls go down down the river well maybe do uh i don't know just off a 
[01:34:30]  barge or something in the in the east river the hudson river just something different how exciting  would that be well it would uh probably really piss off the traditionalists right um imagine like  your your your your home run hitters actually what i really want to do because it goes back to  something i was attempting to do and they stopped me every time trying to hit a golf ball from uh  where we used to work on the roof it's all right we always wondered if uh you'd be able to knock a  golf ball right into central park from the top of our building right so that's uh but imagine so you 
[01:35:00]  get one all right you get one of these buildings that are close to central park right you get on the  roof and you have a home run derby that would be easy to close that area off i'm not even joking  close you know 59th street and a few of the streets what if you slice through the avenue a few of the  avenues just to be safe and and have a home run derby that way how that would be so cool on top of a  building smacking them into central park or whatever just how cool would that be it would be but yeah 
[01:35:30]  they'd never do it the whole city would watch yeah the whole city would watch a home run derby from  one of these bridges or from one of the one of the uh roofs of the building yeah so yes jimmy dave according  to rotten tomatoes on my phone which i get now thanks to the apps yeah easy gags and slack  direction drag this occasionally clever alien out of planet comedy down to unimaginative lows  wow unimaginative i can imagine some low stuff me too that's something what does this mean oh you 
[01:36:00]  all go to rotten tomatoes i have all these tomatoers but then under there's these green splats what's  that mean if it gets below a certain it's a guy's yeah that's a that's a that's a bad review  jimmy 50 or below or something yeah a green like meet dave got 22 percent uh positive reviews  get smart 52 percent yeah and a red splat is put the crib out by the garbage  there you go what about having home run derby from the statue of liberty there's there's joe in new 
[01:36:30]  york oh there you go we're a pretty creative city why are we doing it at yankee stadium who cares  the last one at yankee stadium we could have got creative with this all right uh you want more  mayor menino audio sure we do all right we got a few more clips here so uh this is the latest batch  we have a whole uh catalog of uh mayor menino speaking horribly but this is the new batch this  has never been heard before yes show uh understood and the boston herald has a great article today

[01:56:00]  Joel McHale from The Soup.  Yeah.  On E.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Joel came on Friday after doing the red eye.  Well, part of me came on Friday.  Yeah, you were really tired and had no business doing the radio show with us.  You really needed just to go to your hotel and sleep.  But you're like us, which we appreciate.  You came by and said, I got to say hi to the guys.  And there was a, you know, there was a hypnotist.  So that was an hour of whispering.  Yeah.  San Juan Capistrano.  What?  I'm just watching the news and they, they're doing something from San Juan Capistrano. 
[01:56:30]  It's the world's biggest mooning.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  Joel, are you going to be talking about this on The Soup?  This is a big story.  I watched you guys and gals mooning a Amtrak train.  What's that about, Stunt Brain?  We'll find out.  I don't know.  But it was in San Juan Capistrano.  That's where I lived.  No one cares.  You did?  Yes.  In California.  Swallows came back.  And there was a big parade.  Swallow?  Hoopla.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The swallow. 
[01:57:00]  Hey.  What would happen?  The birds would come back?  What would everybody do?  Everyone drank like crazy.  And ducked.  And shot into the air with pistols that people just wore.  Really?  And walked around with.  It's a lot different now, I hear.  This was back in the actual Old West.  You are old.  I'm really old.  It was the last part of the country that decided the Old West thing was kind of.  Was dead, yeah, because I rode horses.  I used to have to ride fence to mend them because the motorcycle guys would come riding through 
[01:57:30]  and snip the fence and all the cows would get out.  So I'd have to ride fence and mend it together.  And then my father at 13 gave me guns and stuff and told me.  You was 13 when you had you?  My father at 13, yes, he was 13.  My father, when I was 13, my father would give me weaponry like I would shoot one of  these guys or anything.  You had cows and motorcyclists would break through a fence.  Would break through the fence to ride in the hills because the hills were a great place 
[01:58:00]  to ride motorcycles.  So they would snip the barbed wire and the cows would get through into other areas that  they weren't supposed to be in because they were supposed to be grazing in separate areas.  Wow.  And why wouldn't they do the right thing and like fix the fence when they were done?  They're motorcycle guys.  They were like, you know, they were bad guys.  They were the bad guys.  We didn't like them.  No.  Who was president?  Roosevelt?  Yeah.  It was actually Teddy Roosevelt.  Yeah, Teddy.  I mean, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're good all day.  This is 40s music.  You need like old west music. 
[01:58:30]  This is like hip hop.  It's like a shining party music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It should be a guy in a bunny suit pleasuring some other man.  This is as far back as your library goes.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  As far back as we go.  Can you play harmonica?  Hey.  But when the chuck wagon would come around, oh, we would all eat.  Oh, this is the song called When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano.  Oh, is it?  Now you got to like applaud E-Rock.  This is Glenn Miller with a song called When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano.  Maybe a version with lyrics would have been good. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, there's only one version?  Ah, whatever.  Hey, Joel, you can help us out with this.  Yeah.  Abu Dhabi, okay?  They got a lot of our money.  Right.  And they just did a story on TV about how wealthy they are.  Average 24-year-old, guess what they make in Abu Dhabi?  Abu Dhabi.  Average 24-year-old.  We have a lot of 23-year-olds that listen to the show.  All right.  They got a lot of money, right?  Yeah.  70 grand?  All right.  You're going to find out in a few minutes.  All right.  What is that?  A radio tease?  Mm-hmm.  I thought we teased it before the break. 
[01:59:30]  People are not going to switch off now.  They're like, what the hell is this?  I have to know what an Abu Dhabi 25-year-old makes.  I'm not switching.  It's a tease within the bit itself.  Oh, okay.  We'd have to live in Abu Dhabi, though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but they're making it cool.  You can't just move there and start making righteous bucks.  I wouldn't think.  Is that where they're building that island resort?  That looks like a palm tree.  Yeah.  It looks like...  A palm tree.  And it looks like states.  Separate islands.  Yeah, well, they did that, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's way too much money.  Countries.  Yeah.  Well, here we go. 
[02:00:00]  Abu Dhabi.  Good morning, Matt.  I'm in Baghdad today, but I just came from Abu Dhabi, which is part of the United Arab Emirates.  I just came from Abu Dhabi.  I just came from Abu Dhabi.  I mean, why do they have to do that?  Do you think he practiced his voice that way?  They absolutely do.  You know they sit there.  Abu Dhabi.  No.  Abu Dhabi.  Abu Dhabi.  Nice.  That's the one I want.  Now, what if I was way up here with it?  Maybe I should get a little higher and then go down when I say... 
[02:00:30]  I don't even say the words correctly.  I think my voice is so interesting.  People want to hear it, even if I mispronounce...  I'm here in Baghdad.  Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.  United Arab Emirates.  Last week, Abu Dhabi bought New York's famous Chrysler building and today announces a major  purchase of aircraft.  It is just one of the nations in this part of the region.  That's not good.  They're buying our buildings and aircraft. 
[02:01:00]  Who owned the Chrysler building and sold it?  Yeah.  So when they knock down a building, it'll be theirs anyway.  I was just knocking down my building.  They're buying planes and buildings going, no, look, it's ours, okay?  It's my stuff.  If we can do whatever we want, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.  Who owned that building and sold it to them?  And sold it to them.  By the way, a little correction.  Abu Dhabi, yes, is not the same place that has the crazy islands like...  No.  I don't know.  Where they built islands to look just like the United States.  Dubai.  Dubai.  Dubai.  Dubai. 
[02:01:30]  Dubai.  Dubai, Abu Dhabi.  Probably.  I can't tell the difference.  ...of the nations in this part of the region that are benefiting tremendously from rising  oil prices.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Not everyone is suffering from record oil prices.  Wow, really?  Abu Dhabi, a tiny conservative city-state in the Persian Gulf, sits atop 10% of the world's  oil.  It's using the wealth to build and buy everything. 
[02:02:00]  Would you have to listen to this music in a moment?  Cranes clutter downtown.  Shopping malls are filled with designer stores.  Nearby, there's a $3 billion hotel, which claims to be the most expensive ever built.  Just a few decades ago, Abu Dhabi was better known for deserts and falconry.  Uh-huh.  And falconry.  Falconry.  What the hell is that?  That's a hell of a step up.  We had a family reunion there. 
[02:02:30]  Falconry.  We couldn't get enough.  Wow.  I tell you, that oil's a lot better at bringing in the money than falconry.  Falconry.  Opened up a little falconry shop, and we just couldn't make it.  First year is rough, they tell me, in falconry.  A lot of falconry shops fail.  A lot of thick gloves being sold.  Yeah.  Falconry.  And what?  Like those little things they put on?  Those little masks?  Yeah, the little eye things that they put on so they can't see.  So they don't peck your eyeballs out.  Dumb birds.  You blindfold them, and they just sit there on your arm. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, like, what am I supposed to do?  I can't see.  I best not move.  Yeah.  They forget the rest of the world that existed five seconds before that went on.  That's it, yeah.  It just shuts the world out.  That's it.  They're like, well, it doesn't happen.  Nothing's there anymore.  They see everything, and all of a sudden they're frightened, and all of a sudden it's dark,  and they're like, all right, I guess I'll just sit here.  I'll just sit.  Birds are, they're just meant to be.  Yeah, they could see a rabbit from like five miles away.  Yeah.  You would think the rabbit would develop a defense where it could just throw a blindfold  at the hawk.  Yeah.  Spit it out at the, spit a blindfold out. 
[02:03:30]  It throws the hawk.  It's like, I just gotta sit here.  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  Well, it sounds like a great place.  Well, we continue here.  Abu Dhabi is buying up Western culture, too.  Great.  This week, it's hosting a Picasso exhibit from Paris, and plans go well beyond that.  On this uninhabited island, Abu Dhabi is building the first Louvre Museum outside France, a Guggenheim  museum, and a campus of New York University.  On another island, 40 billion.  What?  They're building a New York University in Dubai? 
[02:04:00]  Or Abu Dhabi?  Abu Dhabi.  Abu Dhabi.  Where's your site class?  It's in Abu Dhabi.  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  I really, the whole scheduling.  I might be late.  Yeah, first period's here.  My first class.  I might be late for supper.  And then my second class is in Abu Dhabi.  They used to take different classes there, though.  You have all your regular classes here, and how to properly beat your woman.  How to cane a woman for showing her ankle. 
[02:04:30]  University.  On another island, 40 billion has been budgeted for 100 new schools.  We have for a long time latched onto the idea of making Abu Dhabi an idea capital.  You start by having first class academic institutions, first class cultural institutions.  The scale of construction here is enormous.  When this mosque is finished later this year, it will be the third largest in the world.  That's trouble.  Just part of Abu Dhabi's plans to spend $175 billion on development. 
[02:05:00]  It's all our money.  All our money that we're buying friggin' gasoline with.  It's going to falconry.  Right.  Falconry.  It's falcon.  I say we show them, and we take over the falconry over here.  That'll show them.  That we become the number one country in falconry.  I cannot believe.  We do have our gas money, and we're going to take your falcons.  We are shelling over huge amounts of money so they can just build, build, build over there. 
[02:05:30]  I know.  They're building the third largest mosque.  No.  They're building an amusement park for themselves.  Buying planes, buildings.  Think of that when you're driving that big SUV.  Hey, look.  Where your money's going.  No, no.  It doesn't mean I have to.  That's right, Anthony.  All right.  Yeah.  That's right.  We blame you.  I got an answer.  Ass hats.  I got an answer.  Yeah.  Why the frig should I say.  No, I can't.  It's the regular radio.  For Christ's sake.  What are you doing?  Sorry.  I heard your SUV runs on falcon blood. 
[02:06:00]  Falcon blood.  I squeezed the little heads right in the gas tank.  Why should I sacrifice what I want to drive because of these savages also?  Oh, they're like, oh, just do this.  No.  Why should I pay a lot for gas?  Why should I pay them to build up their countries?  Or the only other choice is that I scale down to a Prius?  Go screw.  I'm not.  I want to drive a big vehicle, and I want their oil for cheap. 
[02:06:30]  Jimmy, that's the problem, right?  We're a superpower, for God's sake.  Let's start acting like one and blowing crap up that we really need.  Not looking too super these days.  No, we're not.  Venezuela.  A lot of oil.  Not a well-liked guy.  Not aligned with many people.  We go down there.  We come up with some idea of why we have to take over.  You're saying we're going to invade Venezuela?  Let's invade Venezuela.  With or without. 
[02:07:00]  It's the only idea I've heard that makes sense.  With or without our falcons.  We will use falcons as our front line of defense.  They're not going to see the falcons coming, I'm thinking.  No, and we train them to peck out Venezuelan eyeballs.  We feed them Venezuelan eyeballs for a year.  They're going to be developing blindfolds right now.  Oh, no.  I told them your plan.  Dammit.  Chavez lost, though.  Didn't he lose in the election?  No.  He won by a landslide.  Why did I think he won?  An oil slide.  Oh. 
[02:07:30]  What?  Because it's rigged.  No, you're thinking about Mugabe.  Mugabe lost, but then he rigged the runoff, and he won that one.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I was thinking of Chavez.  No, Chavez is still there.  He's still there.  He's still there.  No one likes him.  We go down and make up some reason where we, yeah, either that or we just kill him and  insert someone else.  Let's get some old school CIA stuff.  We go down there.  Assassination.  Pop in someone sympathetic to our cause, and we pump some of that Venezuelan oil up here  and tell the Middle East to go blow, as they say. 
[02:08:00]  I'd say go screw.  I use that already.  Develop, you know, some alternative fuel.  Why do we?  Drive an electric-powered SUV.  I'm not driving an electric car.  I'm not George Jetson.  This isn't it.  We don't.  Until cars fly, I don't want to hear it.  I want to be able to drive.  Have you seen that Tesla?  That car?  The Tesla?  It looks like it's a Lotus.  What is it, just?  There's no sound at all.  Lightning bolts are coming off it like Tesla coils.  You just did a Tesla show.  It's a Tesla show.  Oh, the name of the car is a Tesla? 
[02:08:30]  Yes, it uses the flux capacitor.  I thought Tesla.  Oh, speaking of the flux capacitor.  Yes.  We need time travel.  Yes.  No, that car has, you charge it for an hour and a half, and it goes like zero to 60 in  three seconds.  60.  What is 60?  But its top speed is 120.  120.  Again, what's 120?  I won't even get pulled over doing that.  You think your SUV is going to get up to that?  And I, what, you know what sounds good?  Dropping my Shelby into second gear and screaming past somebody. 
[02:09:00]  The engine, the frigging supercharger coming on, it sounds like Mad Max's car.  That's what people want to hear.  That's what Americans want.  We want our gas, we want our gasoline.  Let's put sound effects in there.  Yeah, why not just put a great stereo system?  Like a synthesizer under the hood?  Yeah, push a button.  It sounds like the old school noises.  You might be onto something.  You could put any sort of, you could put a jet engine in there.  All right, imagine a jet engine sound when you go into second gear. 
[02:09:30]  If you had the sound of a blue angel coming out of your car.  Now that would be nice.  That would rule, actually.  I think we came up with a great solution.  Is it true that gas in Venezuela is 15 cents a gallon?  I have to look that up.  Those ingrates.  They're not paying their share.  Yeah, most of them are driving horse-drawn carts.  And America spends over 1.3 billion a week on oil.  Wow.  Now they've drawn horse.  It's in the country where Abu Dhabi is.  A week.  That's one country?  A week.  See, we've got to take someone, we've got to act old school. 
[02:10:00]  You know, why did we decide we're going to stop invading stuff for our own purposes?  I thought we came up with a solution.  We would have speakers on the outside of our electric cars that play the blue angel jet sound.  We just invade the wrong countries.  We should invade Saudi Arabia.  Why isn't Kuwait just handing us barrels of oil?  Yeah.  Why isn't Kuwait just handing us barrels, shipfuls of oil?  Don't we kind of own Kuwait, more or less? 
[02:10:30]  Well, where's our oil from there?  I don't know.  Let me say hi.  And what about the diagonal wells?  We could drill them sideways into Iraq and just sap right out of Kuwait.  Alfonso.  Sideways drilling.  Alfonso.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hello, Alfonso.  Alfonso.  What's up?  I don't know if you've known, but Dubai, they are about to be the biggest city in the world.  They're about to have three of the biggest skyscrapers on the planet. 
[02:11:00]  They're building something five times the size of Disneyland.  They're taking everything, and we're paying for it.  That's right.  Well, one of these skyscrapers, they're going to fall over because they're making them too tall.  You'll see.  Wait on a Muslim fundamentalist.  Somebody will object to that type of behavior.  Right, because it's against their beliefs.  They will call them infidels.  Yeah, stop pointing the finger at us.  Look what's going on.  That's an interesting point that they're living a Western lifestyle.  They're using materialistic things, and money is becoming very important. 
[02:11:30]  American dollars is becoming very important to them.  Maybe we should have a falcon barbecue just to piss them off.  Falcons.  We'll show them.  Unless they're funneling money to the right people to kind of prevent things like that from happening.  Yes.  Also, you can drive that huge SUV.  That's what I want to be able to do.  Why should I sacrifice?  There's plenty of squishy dinosaurs left.  Plenty.  Don't let them fool you.  Why the hell can't we have some? 
[02:12:00]  Squishy dinosaur juice?  Squishy dinosaur juice.  Why aren't we drilling in Alaska?  There's oil.  It's crazy oil up there.  It's not like you can miss it.  It's all white up there.  The oil's black.  You'll see it in a second.  Pump Alaska dry.  That's what I said.  All right.  So let me get this straight.  Yeah.  Invade Venezuela.  Venezuela gets invaded.  Invade Kuwait.  Yes.  Saudi Arabia, drill sideways.  Not invade.  We did them a solid a few years back.  I think they forgot.  Yeah.  We gave them a few Starbucks. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We let them exist.  Sure.  And not be raped and pillaged by Saddam.  Why don't we just invade Canada too?  You know, if they had one thing we wanted, we would have done it a long time ago.  Gordon Lightfoot.  Them in Mexico.  Gordon Lightfoot.  That's true.  Okay.  That is a good.  Sorry.  Very good.  Brian Adams.  I got one more clip from this Abu Dhabi story.  Abu Dhabi.  And this is where we find out where the average 24-year-old makes. 
[02:13:00]  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  Joel McHale said $70,000 a year.  Yeah.  Average.  That's a lie.  What's the average of an American?  Yeah, that's a good question.  This poor guy.  He needs a faster computer.  All right.  He's sun-brained.  The average 24-year-old in America, that's got to be...  Are we playing price-of-the-right rules if you go over?  It doesn't count.  What's the average income of an American?  40-something?  Average household is like $40,000.  Household?  Household.  What about average person?  Well, if you put your children to work.  No.  We should. 
[02:13:30]  Falcon.  Right here.  Falcon shop.  Average 24-year-old in America makes $30,000?  Who's college educated?  Yeah.  Who's college educated?  So that number's a bit high.  Yeah.  Wait to hear what they're making in Abu Dhabi.  The chandelier in this mosque alone is made of a million crystals and 24-carat gold.  Damn.  So are the mosaics.  I got one in my lobby.  The carpet is handmade by 1,200 weavers in Iran.  Lavish, yes.  But people here are hardly suffering. 
[02:14:00]  What would be the average salary for most people your age, your friend, other 24-year-olds?  $180,000 per year.  Per year.  Did you hear that?  180?  Did you hear that?  The average 24-year-old is making $180,000 a year.  That's amazing.  Did you hear that?  $180,000.  The average.  How many Falcons does that buy?  Wow.  No taxes on the money either?  And no taxes. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, my God.  This is paradise.  They're basically making, what, $240,000?  Or $230,000?  Yep.  No taxes.  How expensive is stuff?  Guess where this radio show's going in 78 days.  Yes.  78 days, baby.  Why can't we broadcast from Abu Dhabi?  You wouldn't have to get up in the morning, probably.  You could do like 6, 6 o'clock.  Right.  It'll be mornings here.  Welcome to the Falcon.  In dollars.  Around $180,000.  For you.  For you.  And it's all tax-free. 
[02:15:00]  The government can afford it.  Jesus.  Abu Dhabi sells most of its oil to Asia, so Americans at the pump aren't paying for all  of this, but the region is certainly benefiting from skyrocketing oil prices.  Now, let me tell you something.  This is how well off the country is.  They don't need to take your taxes.  Yeah.  How's that?  Oh, my God.  How's that for a country that's doing pretty well for themselves?  Who owns what, though?  It might just be run by a small select group that owns everything.  They're just building stuff. 
[02:15:30]  The Jews, you're saying.  Well.  You know, I might just insult the Joel McHale.  No, that would be great.  No.  No, but they asked just some guy on the street what the average was, or that was like...  Yeah, you know.  That sounded like a guy on the street that could have just been lying to really freak out everybody.  Oh, we make $180,000.  $180,000.  True.  He's scraping through with $5,000.  Yeah, true.  I'm sure it's higher than $30,000, though.  Perhaps a bit more.  Oh, I'm sure.  Way higher than $30,000. 
[02:16:00]  Well, we've got to get out of here and go over to XM.  Drill.  Drill.  Joel McHale is going to be at the Wilbur Theater.  Yes.  In Boston, Massachusetts.  July 25th.  Yeah.  July 26th, Newport Yachting Center.  Well.  My word.  I'm going to do a little race over there.  I'm not going to wear any socks.  Newport, Rhode Island.  I'm christening my new sleuth.  And then July 27th, Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom.  A fine room up there in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  And tomorrow night, Conan.  Ooh.  Yes.  Look at that.  I mean...  When are you back doing the soup?  A little vacation time?  I fly back on Wednesday and then do the soup on Thursday.  Very cool.  And it's Joel McHale, one word on MySpace.  Blumenreich.  Yes.  You're doing that gig for Blumenreich.  Blumenreich.  The Blumenreich.  The Blumenreich Casino.  Oh, is that?  Yeah.  It sounds like a German war criminal.  Blumenreich.  No.  German war criminals are more generous with the rooms they give you. 
[02:17:00]  What am I supposed to?  Am I supposed to eat $60?  Yeah, stupid.  You are.  I'm not happy, Jimmy, about how they treat you up there.  Dude, I hate being nickel and dimed on small stuff.  I understand business is business, but Jesus, dude.  All right.  $60.  That was the room?  No, that was what he...  That was...  No.  Jimmy wanted a little upgrade, and he deserves a little upgrade. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  In the contract, it's a suite, and he actually scratched out a suite and put back regular  room in the contract.  Jesus.  What an ass.  Like you weren't going to see it?  But it was a $60 difference, I think, for the whole weekend.  I mean, it was a tremendously small amount.  Great.  I didn't do that gig.  I won't do that gig, but the comedy club I did.  With that said, Jimmy, how are Virus Tour tickets going?  I don't know.  I actually haven't talked to Pappalardo, but the people we got on the show, it's August 
[02:18:00]  2nd at PNC.  You can go to Ticketmaster.  It's Patrice, myself, Bob Kelly, Otto and George, Voss, of course.  Also, Mike Birbiglia, Greg Giraldo, Nick DiPaolo.  And I know that there's some comic who we're not announcing, and they are working on somebody  else.  Yeah, very good.  Take us through Ticketmaster.  It's the only show we're doing this summer.  August 2nd, PNC, Homedale, New Jersey, Ticketmaster.com, right?  We would have loved to have you on it.  We didn't know you were doing comedy, Joel.  I didn't really realize I was doing it either until just a couple of months ago. 
[02:18:30]  How about next year?  I would love to.  Okay.  I mean, August 2nd?  August 2nd this year, yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'm in.  We're out of here.  XM.  Thanks for having me, guys.  That's where we're going.  Are you coming on XM?  I got to go to the Today Show.  Thank you.  Oh.  I just dropped that name.  Thank you.  I got to talk to Kathy Lee.  Thank you.  Let me just pick that name up.  Thanks.  There you go.  I'm talking about Falcons again.  We're going to simulcast that and make fun of you now.  Right. 
[02:19:00]  Joel McHale, it's always a pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  I'll be back in November.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  In the world of Radio Shot Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office. 
[02:19:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:20:00]  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No.  No.  Oh, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated.  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up.  Dude, I looked at you and went, boom, like, go.  That was sloppy.  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say?  Jodie Foster?  If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the Hams.  This is where entertainment is going. 
[02:20:30]  I do not touch that.  The only thing that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes.  I am right now.  Oh, my God.  They are sick freaks.  How close did you get to having relations with a dog?  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so they don't scratch them all.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:21:00]  Opie Anthony.  Yes.  We're about a show behind because I think we owe the fine folks a radio show from Friday.  Oh, my God.  So this is Friday's show.  Yeah, that show.  The hypnotizing show.  Yeah.  Not much chatter on that one, huh?  It didn't go quite like we thought it was going to go is the problem.  We thought it was going to have some entertainment value.  She even gets molested boring.  How do you manage to do that?  I don't know, Jimmy. 
[02:21:30]  I don't know.  She has.  And that whole hypnotizing thing.  I don't get it.  Why don't you say it in front of the guy, though?  You know why?  You don't believe in that crap, right?  No, I don't.  I believe in some form of hypnotism by being this just relaxation technique where perhaps  you're relaxed enough where your mind can then open up a little and you remember certain  things as far as all right. 
[02:22:00]  Now, when I snap my fingers, you're going to think that you're a topless dancer and you're  on stage right now and everyone's just loving you.  So go ahead and do.  No, I don't believe it.  The people are acting.  It's fake.  Always.  I want to do a documentary on hypnotism.  Do you?  No.  I just wanted to sound smart.  I got something going on.  Hey, if you want to see a good camel toe, Miss Universe pageant.  Yes.  Pageant.  Who's to?  And Miss Venezuela was showing some fine camel toe in the swimsuit. 
[02:22:30]  Is that why she won?  Segment.  Can we see her again?  Can we create a picture today?  Yeah.  Let's get a picture of Venezuelan's camel toe.  But you're Chavez was fucking putting his fat hog in there.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Red shirts.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Come on, guys.  You took shit and you made it into something.  Yeah.  Especially.  Yeah, more shit.  Especially with the last two lines Patty was coming out with.  Yeah, it was all right.  I'm sitting here at work, so I can't say them, but. 
[02:23:00]  What were they?  Just rhyme.  Yeah.  What was that?  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't go there.  Bye, guys.  I can't go there.  Was he working on a library?  Don't go there.  By the way, we got two women on the bleachers with huge boobs.  Just want to point that out today.  What?  I...  Wow.  Jesus.  Canadian boobs, right?  Jiminy.  Ontario.  Holy shit.  I was almost listening.  I heard Ontario and I said, wow, boobs.  Nice. 
[02:23:30]  Nice feeders.  Feeders.  She's got a green tank top with the purse strap just cutting in between those, I'm trying  to be respectful, those fucking massive tits.  Thanks.  My husband loves them.  Where is he?  Where is he?  My husband?  Yeah.  He's, I don't know.  He's a truck driver.  He's somewhere down here.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  You don't even know where he is?  South Carolina.  Do you ladies wow? 
[02:24:00]  No.  Would you flash?  Would you just show a little of those fucking big meaty tits?  Just a little?  Could you show just a little bit of the, of the, of the fucking, just that pink nipple?  No.  Nipple?  No.  Oh, she will, though.  Her friend will. 
[02:24:30]  Who's, let me see the friend.  Yeah, her friend was kind of like.  Madam, I can't see you.  She couldn't wait to get in front of a microphone, so I'm assuming that would be to say, I will.  No, no, no, I just couldn't see Jimmy.  Hi.  Hi.  Miss, why are you wearing fucking Hannibal Lecter's hat at the end of the first Silence of  the Lambs?  Because it was, it was raining.  I'm showing big tits for dinner.  That's for you.  Madam, would you show your bosoms real quick?  I couldn't.  Why?  Are you a big Jim Norton fan?  Um, yes, absolutely, I read his book.  Oh, thank you.  So how about you, ladies?  I read your book, you magnificent bastard. 
[02:25:00]  Can you smother Jimmy with your big, huge, no, it's, no, I, I don't, I just want to look.  No, no, I don't, I just want to kind of take a peek and just see what, like, the bottom  part of those, those fucking heavy, suckable meat hunks.  Meat hunks.  Those meat hunks.  I'm very tired.  I want to see him, please.  No, I can't do that.  Why?  That's how I ask a girl.  Why? 
[02:25:30]  You're in America.  It's legal here.  I know, what are you fucking timing?  Yeah, in Ontario, it's legal.  All right, fuck her.  How about you?  No.  Could you show just like a little bit?  You don't have to show the whole thing.  Yeah.  Just a little bit?  Yeah.  So hold on, sir, can you move your head?  That's it.  That's a lot of breasts.  Yeah, you got, how big are your nips?  Pardon me?  How big are your nipples?  Like, do you have like small ones or big?  I like big, sexy ones.  No, just little.  That look like the big parody of Jewish noses.  Yeah.  Big Jewish nose nipples. 
[02:26:00]  No, just little.  Like a Nazi propaganda poster of a Jewish person.  Yeah, exactly.  Or something in an Iranian newspaper.  Like their idea of political commentary.  Fucking savages.  How big are the boobies out there?  How big?  I don't want to know.  What do you, you have?  I'm going to guess you have...  Fs.  56 triple M's.  What do you have?  44 triple D.  Triple D.  And how about your friend with the hat?  With the tan hat?  How about your friend, Ricky?  Yes, you're among friends, Ricky. 
[02:26:30]  38 J's.  Take off Steve Irwin's hat.  Wait, she just said 38 in a letter that you should not be saying.  J.  J.  Jesus.  Oh my God.  What does that J mean?  That's the cup size, Jimmy.  Do you really want to get into that?  I do.  The cup size.  38 is the suck time, big J's.  It's an inch difference between around and the fullest part of your breast.  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.  Ten inches.  Between here and here.  Between what and what? 
[02:27:00]  The top of the breast?  Guess what I do for a living.  What do you do for a living?  I fit bras.  Oh, okay.  You do, huh?  So it's from the top of what?  Top around.  Okay.  And then the biggest part of your breast.  I don't get it.  Yeah, you better show us.  It's weird.  Yeah, you better just show us.  I know.  Can you just...  Could you just flash so we won't say that you flashed on the radio?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because there's only like three people listening?  Yeah.  It's accurate in Syracuse. 
[02:27:30]  How about you, miss, up front?  You with a guy?  I got nothing to show, babe.  I don't like this lack of audience participation.  I don't either.  No one's showing titties open.  That's right, Jimmy.  You got nothing to show?  We've never seen that.  We've never seen J's before.  What do you have, miss?  You got little B-cups in there?  They're nice.  Yeah, we'll peer around.  Little itty-bitties?  Take a little look.  No, no.  I'm talking to the lady here with the white.  Oh, oh.  Don't hop over the one lady in her nurse shoes. 
[02:28:00]  And they'll...  No, you have white shoes.  You look very Rosemary's Baby-ish.  I like that.  You look very sexy.  Rosemary's Baby-ish?  Satan is his father.  All right.  All right.  Well, we're going to get...  I have a baby with clothes on it.  We're obviously going to get nothing from the audience.  Well, Ruth Gordon is a devil worshiper.  We can't see the camel toe in this shot of Miss Venezuela, by the way.  I know.  I'm trying.  I guess we got to go with it.  Oh, wow.  You got to go with the video on YouTube.  We're really trying.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  So, we got the iPhone thing, and we got a reporter called a jackass on iPhone Line. 
[02:28:30]  Really?  Yes.  The reporter was called the jackass by, what, a geek?  Yeah, he was trying to have some fun, I guess, with the line, and he was trying to just  get into some geek humor.  Right.  And this particular gentleman wasn't having any of it.  Shit.  Why do the reporters think, like, iPhones is, like, a geeky thing?  I mean, and certainly there's geeks.  Well, I mean...  They want to be the first, but, I mean, this is all-encompassing.  There's a part of it that's geeky, because, I mean, there's a bunch of people waiting  online for a cell phone.  I mean, when you boil it down, that's really what it is.  Who do they have to call? 
[02:29:00]  It's not a cell phone.  Ghostbusters.  It's not a cell phone.  It's an all-encompassing device.  It is, yes.  It is an all-encompassing device.  It's everything but a phone.  I know.  Good luck fucking get a call on it.  This is one of these devices that people have talked about for many years, where we can  integrate a lot of different things into a handheld and easily carried device.  This isn't bulky.  And there's a lot of fucking shit going on in here.  So, I don't think it's that much geeky.  I think the first people that get them, yeah, a little geeky. 
[02:29:30]  You know, you're kind of on the cutting edge of the knowledge of what's out there.  I did.  I got one, and I'm a geek.  I know.  So, you guys didn't stand in line for it, though.  No, I didn't have to.  I'm an important person.  You guys are buying into the iPhone hype, by the way.  I'm waiting for the brand new StarTac to come out.  Ah, the StarTac.  Anyone else with me with the StarTac waiting for the next one?  You got a StarTac when it first came out?  Yeah.  It was happening back then.  Was it?  Here's a reporter being called the Jackets on the iPhone line. 
[02:30:00]  This is an iPhone speaker.  Not as bad as I thought it would be.  Yeah, but you plug some headphones in, and that's crystal clear audio, Jimmy.  No, but I mean, it's louder than I thought.  What, the upgrade?  Is there an upgrade for this?  What is that?  Yours?  Mine.  What are you listening to?  I know the song, but is it a radio station?  You had an upgrade.  What happened?  You upgraded to 2.0, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, they fixed the volume a little bit.  Oh, yeah, good.  Do it on the phone part now, not just the fucking music.  Home run derby.  It's not a black guy's escalator I'm holding. 
[02:30:30]  It's a fucking telephone.  Home run derby from Yankee Stadium tonight instead of from the Brooklyn Bridge.  Very disappointed.  Very disappointed.  Here we go.  iPhone line thing.  You have that song on your iPod?  I just downloaded it.  You got a beef?  Not at all.  You're going to do that dance song?  Which one?  By, uh...  No, that fucking...  I already forgot her name.  Forgot the name of the song.  No, I don't like her.  She stinks.  That's fucking bullshit.  You know what?  The people back at the station had some other questions they suggested I ask of these folks. 
[02:31:00]  No.  Such as, have you ever seen a woman naked?  Hey, you know what?  No, we didn't ask that.  Did you do that?  Yeah.  Hey, we're going to leave you there with those people.  You better watch what you say in front of them.  I know.  They're going to attack if I do.  But, you know, come on.  I mean, what is the...  Come on.  You know, honestly.  I'm with you, Eric.  You know, what is the deal?  It's a phone, for God's sake.  It's a phone.  Do we need to...  You are kind of chickening out, Brad says.  Our producer says you're chickening out from asking him the questions.  No, I'm not chickening out.  He told me he didn't have time.  You want to see me do it? 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Here you go.  Good morning to you.  Do you prefer gadgets or human beings if you had to choose?  Human beings.  Have you ever seen a woman naked?  What?  This is kind of jackass, no?  Oh!  Yes!  Thank you.  I bet you.  Yeah, I do.  It's kind of dumb, too.  You might want to go down somewhere else.  Whoa!  There you go.  Hey, yo.  What's going on here, Jimmy?  Getting a little saucy with the morning news. 
[02:32:00]  I actually like the reporter in this one.  The guy.  I hate the fucking hens he has back at the studio.  Fucking clucking.  And I hate that snotty fucking douchebag online.  Just answer the question funny, asshole.  You're standing there waiting for a phone.  You're getting rained on in a lawn chair for a phone, you cunt.  You want to ask more?  No, I think you've made friends enough in that lineup. 
[02:32:30]  Just kidding, my friend.  What's the book you're reading?  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  God, sense of humor.  This is not smart.  All right, all right.  This is journalism to you?  We're going to see a fight.  Yeah, this is journalism to you.  God bless that guy.  He's a douche, but I kind of like him, too.  Yeah, why not?  This is journalism to you?  All right.  This is journalism to you?  We're going to see a fight.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Walking away.  Walking away. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  Okay.  Let it go.  That all ended poorly.  Poorly.  In tears.  Hello, everybody.  That was Eric Spilman.  Good morning.  Eric Spilman reporting from the iPhone store in Burbank.  Oh, the Apple store.  The iPhone store.  The iPhone store.  They called it the iPhone store?  The iPhone store.  When you have to get tampons, where do you go?  To the bloody vag emporium?  Stupid bitch.  You don't name it after one product.  The iPhone store.  Spoken like a true retard. 
[02:33:30]  I'm so fucking tired.  Are you, Jim?  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  I never sleep well Sundays because my weekend schedule kicks in because of doing the late  shows.  Sundays blow like that.  They really do.  I got to play my fucking bangle song just to remind me.  Oh.  Magic Mondays.  Of course.  Sunday's my fun day.  The worst line in that song is she goes, come on, baby, let's make some noise. 
[02:34:00]  Let's make some noise.  They're going to fuck.  But how do you make noise on a Monday?  Well, I mean, that was a fucking reference.  That they're going to have sex.  That wasn't the worst fucking reference in song history, by the way, because I believe  Pat Benatar lays claim to that with before I put another notch in my lipstick case.  Ugh.  Another notch.  Like, every time she fucking gets a fat cock in her, she takes her nail file and files  a little notch in her lipstick case.  Yeah, there's another dick in for me. 
[02:34:30]  Ugh.  I think that she goes, you know what happens is, she uses a lot of lipstick because she  has herpes one, and she has a fucking, what amounts to a small red medicine ball on her  mouth.  Fuck Pat Benatar.  And she's got to smear that red lipstick.  Like to eat her ass and then just crucify her music in front of her.  All right.  You want to do 20 worst lyrics ever?  Worst lyrics?  Yeah.  It's on a website.  Well, the website we'll give out in a few minutes here.  I hope that works.  Well, Elton John made the list with, if I was a sculptor, but then again, no. 
[02:35:00]  But then again, no.  Or a man.  Wait, if I was a sculptor, but then again, no?  Because he's thinking, if I was a sculptor, but then again, no.  And then, or a man who makes potions in a traveling show.  Mm-hmm.  Doesn't make sense.  That's the next line?  Yeah.  Yes.  What stupid song is that?  Anybody out there got it?  Some $18 billion grossing song?  Your song.  Very good song. 
[02:35:30]  It's called Your Song.  That song sucks anyway.  All right.  Let's go to the next one.  Is that Daniel, my brother?  Is that the same fucking song?  No, that's Daniel.  Good.  I'm glad I don't know that fucking fruits catalog.  Having another pair of balls, stupid.  He should take all the fruits he knows, chop them up, and make a salad in his hat that  he wears as hair.  In case I was a fucking, I was a sculptor.  I'd make myself a big cock and sit on it.  That's what he'd make.  A giant porcelain dick. 
[02:36:00]  And you'd fucking bounce up and down on it.  Look at Billy Joel at the garden.  As you two fucking strum away on your pianos.  Pianos.  Fucking stupid girl instrument.  Side by side with your pianos.  That fucking piano stinks.  Tickle the ivories.  Number 19.  Worst lyrics ever.  Ready for this one?  Uh-huh.  Lucky that my breasts are small and humble, so you don't have to confuse them with mountains.  Who the fuck?  Dolly Parton.  Anyone out there? 
[02:36:30]  Wait.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Olivia Newton-John.  Cheryl Crowe.  That's terrible.  Yeah, she's got tiny little boobies.  Anyone out there?  Song call?  Meatloaf.  Good for you.  I couldn't think of a fat guy.  I'm such a non-improving asshole.  I was just at E-Rock.  By the way, why aren't you guys saying hi to Bob out there?  He's holding the mic.  Hello, Bob. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, Bob.  Top of the morning to you, Bob.  Hey, Bob with the microphone.  Hello.  Hey, you're doing it, Bob.  There's Bob.  Does he look English or what, guys?  Yeah, a little bit.  I caught Bob, by the way, napping on the job.  Oh.  Where?  Pretty much.  I walked into the studio a little early this morning to take a phone call.  What time?  Like 9.20?  You saw when I left.  Yes, a little early.  No, it was probably 5.15, something like that. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, sure.  And there was Bob, and he's just sitting on the couch in the studio, just sitting there.  And right when I walked in, he stood up real quick like I had caught him doing something.  And he's like, oh, I didn't know you were in.  Like, something about getting breakfast or something.  Oh, shit.  What happened there, Bob?  That's right.  I was sitting there looking through the window on the studio door waiting for you to arrive.  I was planning to give you a minute or two to relax, get yourself situated, and then I would come and ask you for breakfast. 
[02:38:00]  But wasn't it past the time I usually get there?  Yeah, but, I mean, you show up late sometimes, so I don't know.  Ooh.  Yeah, I'm getting chastised.  So Bob is saying he's entitled to a break because you fucking take your time.  So because I show up late sometimes, you assume that I'm going to be late every day.  So instead of checking at 5.  No, I assumed you weren't there because I didn't see you go past the window.  But I obviously failed because you snuck past me somehow.  And you had been sitting there then for 15 minutes.  That's right.  Wow, he's sounding a little fucking, like, snippy with me. 
[02:38:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  He's like, yeah, you've been sitting there.  He's like, that's right.  No.  As if to be followed with.  And what are you going to do about it?  Do you think it's ironic that Anthony would criticize you when he typically comes in late?  A little bit, but it was my mistake.  I don't typically come in late, according to Bob.  Today was my mistake, and I'm not going, I'm not debating that.  I'm usually in by 5 to 5.05.  For a guy who comes in, like, a lot of times later, you think it's weird that he's busting 
[02:39:00]  your balls for taking a fucking little nap.  I'm not saying that Anthony comes in late on a regular basis.  I'm just saying that every once in a while, it's happened before.  So that's what I thought, perhaps.  Ooh.  Perhaps.  I was wondering if you were sitting on the couch waiting for the EROC meeting that  EROC decides to do every once in a while.  Ah, the EROC intern pep show.  No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't.  The pep rally.  Have you been part of the EROC meeting yet?  I don't believe so, no.  What's the EROC meeting?  Any interns in-house today that had us sit through an EROC meeting? 
[02:39:30]  I walked in a few times very early in the morning, and EROC is giving the interns a  talking to as they sit on the couch.  What the fuck does he possibly have to say to them?  No one else has seen this yet?  No.  Who else has seen the EROC?  You're one of the...  Who are you?  Wow.  I'm one of the new guys.  You're an intern for this show?  Yes.  Since when?  Uh, about a month or so.  Get the fuck out of here.  Are you serious?  You've been here a month?  Yes.  Have I ever said hi to you?  Well, I bought you all your toys in front of you, so, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Oh!  Thank you.  The new toys after, uh, Tibby Tom sat in your seat.  Now you're ringing a bell.  Yeah.  All right.  Ba-dum-bum.  Uh, you had to sit through an EROC meeting.  What is that all about?  It was more of a post-show meeting than the pre-show that you guys are describing.  So he sits you down, and then what happens?  Uh, it was kind of the whole staff, but, uh, just kind of a rundown of the things that  people have maybe screwed up in the recent days, or that day.  Oh, so he, uh, chastises the, uh, the crew.  Just kind of gives everyone a, uh, a helpful heads up. 
[02:40:30]  A power trip.  What did he say about you?  Since he's shit on all the time, he has to shit on somebody.  Where is EROC?  Can we get him in here?  Maybe he can give a pep talk?  I would love to hear his pep talk.  Here comes EROC.  No, I've seen this.  He, he, he has, he has intern meetings.  EROC, why do you have intern meetings?  In the morning, it's not a meeting.  It's usually, like, it's talking about, like, what they did over the weekend or something,  or, it's nothing really.  But they're all sitting on the couch, listening to you.  He wants to hold court so badly. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, it's like a seminar.  Or something going on.  They mostly don't want to be in the way.  Well, you are, you are the most senior intern.  So, that, uh, that probably helps.  What do you say, EROC, when you talk to them?  Yeah, what do you say?  Not much.  Usually, they tell me what's been going on with them.  But you have to initiate this, right?  Sam, you know, Ron.  Ron, hip-hop, Ron.  After the show is different.  Hip-hop, Ron.  What's up?  A lot of times before the show, Eric will come in and tell us why he was late that morning.  Usually, it's like a traffic accident or something.  Oh, man. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, nice.  Face.  Face?  No.  All right.  Wait, hold on.  What are you saying no for?  Ron is saying yes.  What's going on?  Yeah, I believe Ron.  Stay here, Ron.  Do you give a little, uh, explanation as to why you were late?  I usually say hi.  I don't talk to them that much.  Oh.  It's usually Duffy or Jared.  Uh, bullshit.  Pat Duffy's in line.  He's saying that he's been through many EROC meetings.  Oh, I can't wait to hear that.  Mr. Duffy, how are you, sir?  What's up, fellas?  Are we paying you yet?  Not yet.  Yeah, I don't know what happened. 
[02:42:00]  I know.  I'm at my day job right now.  I'm really sorry, but, uh, I didn't foresee XM completely falling apart as we're trying to,  like, replace Thann, so I don't know what to say.  Yeah, it's all right.  I've been hearing since Thann left.  Something will happen, so I'm waiting.  It's all right.  Uh, but, uh, I think we only have, what, 70, what are we down to, guys?  78 days?  What?  78.  78 days and counting left on our contracts.  All right.  What do you got there, Pat Duffy?  EROC meetings.  I've sat through many an EROC meeting, but I wouldn't describe it as a meeting, but Eric  likes to come in and discuss stuff that he watched on television the night before, and he 
[02:42:30]  likes to talk about music that he's listening to lately, and he likes to talk about  his life.  And you have to sit there and listen to this?  Well, yeah, because we've already set the studio up, and since there's no, uh, there's  no green room anywhere in turn office, we have to wait in the studio.  So Eric rolls in at, like, 530, 545, and then, uh, we just gotta hang out with Eric until  about showtime.  Is that a pretty interesting talk he gives, Pat?  Yeah, sometimes.  I bet it's just like The Office, you know?  I bet he's just like Gervais, comes in, ready to just talk about what he did, and people 
[02:43:00]  are just like, oh my gosh.  Trying to be interesting?  Shut the fuck up, yeah.  Compelling?  Yeah.  And just being a boob.  Pat, a lot of people ask you, what is your, uh, regular job, or whatever?  I'm a landscaper.  Huh.  Uh, that career.  I work with a crew of Peruvians.  Ah.  Of course you do.  Yes.  Well, I'm a dirty gringo.  All right.  Do you get to ride in the truck, or in the back with the grass? 
[02:43:30]  It depends on what we do.  Sometimes I ride in the back.  I prefer the back.  I'm outside.  Really?  With the grass?  With the grass blown out of those giant green pails?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Giant green buckets.  I love them.  Awesome.  I filled them, I filled them with water at the basin.  Cold plenty.  Sounds fascinating.  All right.  Must be on his iPhone.  Thank you, Pat Delphi.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Thank you, Hip Hop, uh, Ron.  And, uh, and wherever Bob went. 
[02:44:00]  Let's say hi to John in Rockland County.  John.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Hey, I, uh, I wanted to tell you guys, I got my, uh, GPS to Curse.  I told you how to, uh, yeah, yeah.  How?  I, I, I, well, basically you program it into your favorites.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam what?  What?  Program it into your favorites on your, uh, GPS.  And, uh, when you pass by the house, like, it'll say, uh, you know, the fucking bitch's  house. 
[02:44:30]  Wait, how do you do that?  You, you, like, type it in.  Right.  You could type in a location.  Okay.  As girlfriend's house or something.  Okay.  And it would say girlfriend's house.  So he types fucking bitch's house and it says fucking bitch's house.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, that's definitely cool.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking that's a good app.  What's the app?  I could, I could do it now if you want.  Okay.  All right.  Let's hear it.  All right.  What it's going to do now is going to, uh, first of all, it's going to make, uh, I'm  going to make a right hand turn.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  And then when I pull up in front of the house, hold on.  Turn right on Beachwood Road.  Okay.  Now when I hit the house, it'll say, you know, the fucking bitch's house.  Okay.  Take about a minute or so.  Not less than that.  That's all right.  That's not long in radio.  Hang on.  Yeah.  It's almost there.  Arriving at the fucking bitch's house.  All right.  The fucking bitch's house.  All right.  That's all right.  All right.  And he's gone.  He knows how to punch out.  That's it.  Punch out.  By the way, that was, uh, yes.  A few people got it. 
[02:45:30]  Shakira.  Lucky that my breasts are small and humble so you don't confuse them with mountains.  Want another bad lyric?  Yes.  All right.  Number 18 on this list is, I love you like a fat kid loves cake.  Oh, yeah.  I love you like a fat kid loves cake.  Uh, I love you like a, Fitty.  Fitty.  It's Fitty Sense.  Oh, is that Fitty?  I wouldn't know.  I think he's a terrible lyricist anyway. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  He's not a, he's not a good writer.  He's just got a cool voice.  But I don't think he's a very good, uh, hanging in the club, drinking bub.  Bub.  Give me a hug.  In the club.  What?  You don't think he's a good emcee?  The black people love the club.  Don't they?  But the bub.  The club.  Bottle full of bub.  What are you doing?  Uh.  There's always shit going on in the club.  I know.  Why don't they stop?  How come I'm in a library?  It doesn't rhyme with bub.  A nice chess match.  Yeah, nice chess game.  Uh, here's one.  Going to the college. 
[02:46:30]  Getting me some knowledge.  Never hear that shit.  Exactly.  Because nothing else rhymes with it.  Bub at the club.  Going to do college and knowledge and then what?  College again.  Say, I'm learning how to figure.  Woo!  What?  What are you doing?  There are plenty of things that rhyme.  Next, uh.  Calm down.  That's right.  Next bad lyric you got.  There's an insect in your ear.  If you scratch it, it won't disappear.  Anyone from the gallery?  It was a very popular song two years ago. 
[02:47:00]  Maybe three.  Maybe three.  There's an insect in your ear.  If you scratch it, it won't disappear.  U2's staring at the sun.  Ugh.  Oh.  Huh.  They're usually better at their...  No, they're not.  No?  You hate them?  Okay.  Alright, how about this?  They're so overrated.  Relentless lust of rotting flesh to thrash the tomb she lies.  Heaven whore.  Or heathen.  Oh yeah, heathen whore of Satan's wrath. 
[02:47:30]  I spit at your demise.  Is that Slayer?  Damn, Jimmy.  What song?  What song?  What song?  What song?  What song?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What song?  What song?  Necrophilia.  What song?  What song?  Necrophilia.  Oh.  Alright, let's do one more.  This bit's going nowhere.  Fun.  I'll skip ahead if you want to get to the top.  Yeah, let's go to the top.  Well, let's see what the next one is.  Oh, yeah.  Leaving was never my proud. 
[02:48:00]  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  He was never my proud?  Yeah.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  It was when he was going through his blue phase.  When Michael Stipe was going through his blue phase.  Yeah.  R.E.M.?  Blue phase.  R.E.M.'s leaving New York.  Hey, fucking.  Ah.  R.E.M.  Fucking stinks.  Alright.  Fucking douchebags.  How about this one?  Losing my.  Are you?  You can fucking lose your T-cell.  I guess I beg. 
[02:48:30]  Never seen an ass.  My pee-pee go.  Doing, doing.  Or doing the.  That's Eminem, yo.  I don't care.  I don't know who it is.  That was, uh, ass like that.  How about another one?  This is starting to go good now.  Fucking rapper.  It's a terrible.  Uh, there were plants and birds and rocks.  Plants and birds and rocks and things.  That's stupid, uh.  Mm-hmm.  Charlie Dan.  Ah, no.  There were plants and birds and rocks and things. 
[02:49:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-ba-ba-dee-oh-wa-ba-dee-oh.  Oh, nee-no.  Na-na-na-na.  Na-na na-na.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Na-na-na-na.  La-la-la-la.  plants and hills and  first thing and then was the fly  with a butt and the sky  with no... That whole song sucks.  And then...  A horse with no name.  America, yes.  That is an atrocious song. 
[02:49:30]  He's just naming stuff.  He's a fucking asshole.  Go through a desert with a horse. Get a camel, you fuck.  Time is like a clock  in my heart.  That's Culture Club's time who gives a shit.  Let's move on to the next one, Danny.  We're going to rock it through this bit.  I wish it was Sunday.  That's my fun day.  My I don't have to run day.  There you go, Jimmy.  Fucking bangles.  My I don't have to run day.  But then she's like, come on, honey. 
[02:50:00]  Let's make some noise.  And he goes, whoo-hoo.  Whoo-hoo-hoo.  What kind of noise are you going to make?  Hopefully it's crying.  There's a good sodomies happening.  We're skipping number 10.  Why? I want to hear it.  I'm all out of faith.  This is how I feel.  That was that Natalie Imbruglia.  I'm Bruglia.  I'm Bruglia.  I'm Bruglia.  I'm Bruglia.  Didn't she fucking ruin?  Who did she ruin?  David Schwimmer she was dating?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Natalie Imbruglia.  How about, now you're amazed by the VIP posse. 
[02:50:30]  Stepping so hard like a German Nazi.  K-fed.  She's a K-fed.  Very close.  Vanilla Ice.  Very good, Jimmy.  Play that funky music.  Yeah, one of my favorites.  Number eight.  Coming up here.  Worst lyrics ever.  My panty line shows.  Got to run in my hose.  My hair went flat.  Man, I hate that.  Marilyn Manson.  Shania.  Oh.  Oh.  Is that the big booby monster?  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Big booby monster came up with one.  Song called Honey, I'm Home.  Ooh.  All right.  Number seven.  Just yell it out, guys.  Whoever gets it first out there.  I don't think that I've got the stomach calling you today.  What?  Saves the day's see you.  Moving on.  Couldn't give a shit.  Number six.  Your butt is mine.  Ugh. 
[02:51:30]  Tell him John again.  Your butt is mine.  Don't know.  Who was it?  Michael Jackson from Bad.  It's the opening lyric from Bad.  Really?  Ugh.  I thought it was, you're bad, you're bad, you're bad.  No?  No.  That song starts with your butt is mine.  I did not know that.  Yeah.  Uh, but if there is ever changing world in which we live in.  Oh. 
[02:52:00]  Paul McCartney.  Live and let die.  I guess if I read it correctly, but it so got it.  Uh, that was number five worst lyric of all time.  Number four is young, black, and famous with money hanging out the anus.  That's the motherfucking Diddy.  How do you know that's the motherfucking Diddy?  Because I see the picture of Diddy.  Don't look.  Don't look, you.  I won't look now.  I just saw Diddy.  All right.  I really couldn't see, uh, the way the pictures are, but, um.  I'm looking at the ugliest woman on the face of the earth.  Oh my God. 
[02:52:30]  Wow.  Holy shit.  She has a horrible face.  Leslie Clark from the Miami Herald, if you could Google her up.  Oh, she has a permanent and a fucking neck.  She has a neck like a fucking brontosaurus.  Wow.  It's also a big Adam's apple.  She looks like a tranny.  She has to be a guy.  And it looks like she's waiting to get off camera so she could chew the rest of her sandwich.  Yeah, she's, look at that.  She had some work dolls.  Yeah.  Jesus.  She had a fuck, she was integrated with a puppet head.  Obama!  Oh, Christ.  This fucking asshole overreacting to that New Yorker cover that shows him and Michelle. 
[02:53:00]  It's obviously a parody of the politics of fear.  But it's inappropriate and offensive.  Shut up, you faggot.  Everybody's offended.  Everyone's offended by every fucking thing.  Can you do political cartoons now without these?  Assholes getting sensitive?  I'm so distracted by this awful woman.  She's horrendous.  She has a face like an emu.  Big fucking long neck.  Something like an ostrich.  She's a monster.  I bet she could take a cop down that fucking windpipe, though. 
[02:53:30]  Of course, she could as well as a leg.  A fucking basketball.  She might have been a guy because there's something going on with that Adam's apple.  Like they try to let it down or something.  Yeah, it's huge.  Whole gutters, Nick.  Jesus.  No kidding.  Fucking snake.  Hey, fucking active thyroid.  All right, here we go.  The number three.  Worst lyric of all time.  I don't like cities, but I like New York.  Other places make me feel like a...  A...  Dork.  How do you know that?  I don't know.  It's the only thing that would rhyme.  It's the only thing that really rhymes. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, I don't know.  A mork?  Robin Williams?  Anybody out there?  A fork.  A fork?  Eric Nagel?  Sorry, Eric.  I love New York by Madonna.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Number two.  Runner up.  Worst lyric of all time.  War is stupid and people are stupid.  Um...  Is it old?  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I really don't know. 
[02:54:30]  Um...  Ted of the Mercies?  Ted.  We were in, um...  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Culture Club's war song.  See, when you're making one of these lists, you gotta pick songs that people know.  People know.  Come on.  Number one lyric of all time as far as being worst.  Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago.  Why is that a bad lyric?  Because it's not coast to coast.  Chicago's not a coast. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You should coast to coast, L.A.  That's not the worst of all time, though.  I see what you're saying.  That's definitely not the worst of all time.  I've...  How about someone's knocking at the door?  Door?  Someone's ringing the bell.  Do me a favor.  Open the door and let him in.  Right.  What the fuck is that?  Hopefully it's Mark Chapman again.  Fucking asshole.  You make a good point there.  It's terrible.  Coast to coast.  It is terrible.  That was Shardé with Smooth Operator, yes. 
[02:55:30]  They call it the worst one?  Now see our readers' 20 worst lyrics ever.  Oh, good.  Uh...  I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy.  Yeah, that's a terrible lyric.  What the fuck are they talking about?  It's Bob Marley.  Yeah, well...  It's not a bad lyric.  Why would you shoot the deputy if you could shoot the sheriff, right?  You'd be accused of something you didn't do.  Right.  Fucking Sheriff John Brown always fucking hated him.  Fucking guy would plant his seeds and he would make him take him down. 
[02:56:00]  And fucking Sheriff John Brown was trying to shoot him down.  Yeah.  So he shot...  He shot him down.  He didn't shoot no deputy.  But he's going to go to jail anyway.  Yeah, so fess up to it.  And who did shoot the deputy then?  Who the fuck knows?  What is he, a detective?  He's just a fucking Rasta with brain cancer.  It's a coincidence, though, that the sheriff gets shot and then also the deputy gets shot.  Yeah.  And it's two different people that do it?  Come on.  I'm not buying it.  You're preaching to the choir.  And how are you going to run the town without a deputy?  Or a sheriff. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  The next worst lyric, according to the listeners or readers of this awful website,  you're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful, it's true.  You're beautiful!  That fruit.  James Blunt.  Steve Blunt.  Barking.  Dings.  Jimmy hates James Blunt.  I fucking, he's everything that makes me nauseous.  He bangs hot broads, though, Jimmy.  Of course he does.  He fucking sings like one.  Fucking faggoty lyrics.  I could have another you in a minute.  Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute. 
[02:57:00]  I can have another you in a minute.  Yeah, well, who's that?  Is it EWE?  Charlie Daniels again.  Beyonce.  No, that's the Beyonce.  Beyonce.  He's a guy.  We move on to number 17.  Like a Rock, Charging from the Gate.  Like a Rock.  Chevy?  Bob Seger.  Bob Seger.  He sucks, too.  Why does Bob Seger suck? 
[02:57:30]  He's fucking terrible.  Turn the page.  Exactly.  I can't.  I don't know if that's a song.  Yes, Metallica redid it, but the original's way better.  Let's get those old records off the shelf.  Here I am on the road again.  Oh, that is a good song.  Here I am up on a stage.  Number 16, you got...  This is just a great lyric.  What are they talking about?  Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry. 
[02:58:00]  In five days from now, he's going to marry.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Willy Wonka?  He's hoping you can make it there if you can, because in the ceremony, you'll be the  best main.  Wait.  Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry in five days.  From now, he's going to marry.  It's, uh...  What?  What happened?  God damn it.  What?  All right.  We got...  All right.  The answer is bust a move. 
[02:58:30]  Young MC.  Well, let's say hi to Waylon.  He's got a horrible lyric he wants to add to the list.  Yes, uh, Waylon.  Worst one I've ever heard of.  Uh, Beth, get out of my way.  Pendulum is swinging back the other way.  The way...  Later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Oh, my God.  Let's rock.  Steven Carr.  If you guys want to sing along out there, you're more than welcome.  My wife.  You're out of line. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Listen to that.  Yes.  Ah, Danny just shakes his head into utter disgust.  Get Musket out of my way.  Let's move on to the next one.  Pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Love that.  Yes.  Ah, there's the lead singer right there now.  It's Steven Carr.  Steven Carr, everyone.  The great Steven Carr.  Yes.  Waiting for a follow-up hit.  All right.  Should we go on with the reader's 20 worst lyrics ever or what?  I think so.  All righty. 
[02:59:30]  I'm respected from California way down to Japan.  Another brother.  Timbaland's Give It To Me.  Never heard of this song.  You know what was a bad line?  What?  Like the L.A. to Chicago line.  It was Kim Wilde in Kids in America.  She says, from New York to East California, there's a new wave coming, I warn you.  What happens to the rest of California?  Like L.A.  There was no new wave coming in L.A.? 
[03:00:00]  No.  She missed an entire state and a pretty important one.  Dumb bitch.  She was hot, though.  She had big chapped lips.  Who did?  Kim Wilde.  Kim Wilde was hot?  Remember her?  She sang, uh, We're the Kids in America.  Oh.  We're the Kids in America.  I don't remember.  She had, like, juicy lips, though.  She did.  Pretty big.  Pop it up on, uh, fucking YouTube or some shit.  We're trying to get through this, too.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah. 
[03:00:30]  Let's see.  Hmm?  Do you have that one?  I think we do.  I don't like that one.  All right.  Why don't we cut our losses?  How about the, how about go to the top five, uh, worst?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's not count down from fucking 17.  What a lovely way of saying, uh, what, a meatloaf, I would do anything for love, but  I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, well, like, what was that?  Yeah, what was that?  Come on, the O.B. and Anthony show.  That fat prick.  And his shitty fucking lack of introspective documentary.  Like, they kick him right in his fat meat tits. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, fuck meatloaf in his fuckhole.  Stupid fucking melodramatic zilch collapsing after shows.  Yes.  Why don't you stay home?  I got a very good one.  Uh, number seven, uh, caught my attention.  Are you ready for this?  Oh, okay.  Are you ready for this?  Are you ready for this?  No.  Oh, that wasn't the line?  No, no, no, no.  Here we go.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Ah, from a little song, 1935.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, here we go. 
[03:01:30]  Someone left a cake out in the rain.  Ah.  I don't think that I could take it, because it took so long to bake it.  And I'll never have that recipe again.  Oh, is that?  Oh, no.  What?  Never have the recipe for the cake that he left out in the rain in MacArthur Park.  Right.  The dumbest song ever.  And why would you leave a cake out in the rain to begin with?  Because cake is for fucking fatos, and so you just leave it out there and let one of  the pigs go grab it.  They're like, hey, pig, it's raining all over the cake. 
[03:02:00]  Hopefully she gets rained on.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock decided to participate in the bit.  Thank you, E-Rock.  And not even the right version.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Thank you.  And not even the right version.  We've only done 20 of these, and he finally decided to do one.  He's excited, because it's about cake.  This is in his iPod.  Yeah, what version is this?  A lot of different versions.  The disco version.  Didn't Donna Summers do a version, or one of those broads?  This one, like, the cast of Chips would skate to.  Right, right.  That's true. 
[03:02:30]  In the roller skating episode.  Fucking.  All right, number six is, he was a boy, she was a girl.  Can I make it any more obvious?  Yeah.  Avril.  Avril Lavigne.  Skater boy, spelled B-O-I.  Of course it is.  That's the cool way to spell it.  Number five, here we go, finally.  Sucking on a chili dog outside the tasty freeze.  John Cougar melon head.  Why is that a bad lyric, though?  That's an actual event.  Someone's having some food outside the tasty freeze. 
[03:03:00]  Exactly.  I hate the whole song, by the way.  Jack and Diane.  Little ditty.  About Jack and Diane.  Because I could give a fuck about Jack and Diane.  Two white trash pieces of shit in some shit town, eating hot dogs.  It's a part of Americana, though.  Fuck them.  No, it isn't.  This is what happens in Americana.  Cutting fucking beef farts.  You got a hand on life.  You got a hand between your knees.  Jack and Diane, let's run up behind a shady tree.  Ugh.  Listen to this.  What?  Wow, man.  It's just a ballad about two American kids in the heartland. 
[03:03:30]  Who gives a shit?  Football star.  Izzy.  Who is not?  What's going to happen to this whore?  Ah.  Of Jackie's car.  She's just getting fucked by Jackie.  The tasty freeze.  Tasty freeze.  Why are we looking at Kathy...  Fucking...  Ugh.  Why are we looking at Kathy Gifford in a sports bra?  She has a nice tits.  She's...  Ugh.  And see, there's...  She's sucking Giff's blood out of her...  Fucking...  What is that? 
[03:04:00]  We were supposed to talk to the inventor of this.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah, we had one of these around the office.  It's basically...  You put alcohol in your bra, and then you can sneak it into sporting events and stuff,  and then you suck it like one of those hats you can wear with the beer cans on it,  but the booze is in your bra, so people can't really check for it.  I'll have a white Russian right out of your tit, lady.  If we got one for the boobie monster out there, we could get the whole audience drunk!  Whoa-ho!  Oh-ho!  So, and this guy... 
[03:04:30]  It's the one for, like, if you have a gut.  Yeah, they do the beer belly one, too.  Makes it look like you got a beer belly.  So you could sneak a lot of alcohol into a game, making money have a beer belly.  And then what do you piss into that bag?  Ew, look at the bag of alcohol.  It looks like a kiss already.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Ew.  Is that at all fucking necessary?  No.  Just fucking buy a beer!  I'm a fucking drunk, and I think that's stupid.  Yeah.  Danny, comment?  It's hard.  Okay.  Steve?  Two out of three drunks.  Everybody knows you get drunk before the event.  Right.  That, and we had one of those in the studio, and you guys tore it to shreds. 
[03:05:00]  Did we?  Yeah.  I don't remember even talking about it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We brought it in.  I brought it into the studio, and somebody said, what is this?  And it got mutilated.  Yeah.  I think Kathie Lee's supposed to be drinking wine.  Oh.  Looks like she shoved it up her pussy.  Ew.  Ew.  She's drinking her own period juice.  Yeah.  Lovely.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Let's move on.  Number four, readers, 20 worst lyrics ever.  My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump, my lovely lady lumps. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  George Harrison?  Oh.  Yeah, the black-eyed peas.  Number Trey.  Get it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two more jokes.  I am, I said.  I am, I said.  To no one else.  Right?  Yeah.  Something like that.  And no one heard at all.  Not even the chair.  I am, I said. 
[03:06:00]  By Neil Diamond.  Yeah.  The chair didn't hear him.  I am, I cry.  And the chair still didn't.  The chair never heard the fucking guy.  Still not reacting?  No.  Why wouldn't the chair react to this?  Because it's a chair.  The chair doesn't care.  Two shores.  Mm.  It is fine, but it ain't home.  New York's home, but it ain't mine no more. 
[03:06:30]  I am, I said.  They come into America.  No one heard at all.  Even the sofa.  Not even the toaster.  I am, I said.  I cry.  Let's go to number two so we can move on to some, like, stuff. 
[03:07:00]  I am, said I.  Have you ever been to St. Tropez?  St. Tropez?  Or seen a brother play a mandalay.  Diddy's I Need a Girl, part two.  Oh.  Diddy?  Yeah.  Is number one?  Number one is this.  Oh.  This will be worth it.  I'm serious.  It will.  Don't you want me, baby?  Oh, my God.  Mike Chung?  Only time will tell if we stand the test of time. 
[03:07:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Anybody out there?  Fuck.  Who said that?  The boobie monster again?  Wow.  Yes, Van Halen.  Why can't this be love?  Very good.  That fucking song is fucking horrendous.  I think Jimmy's just, like, nodding off and popping in when he feels like it.  Could this be love?  What's wrong with Van Halen with Sammy Hagar?  They fucking stink.  Listen to Hagar's voice, though. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, his deal.  Hagar's got a great voice.  Who gives a shit?  His voice is all right.  It's good.  What's wrong with the lyrics, Jimmy?  He's got great range.  They're a fucking horrible Van Halen.  Even old Van Halen's mediocre at best.  Most overrated band ever.  I don't like Van Halen either.  They fucking blow.  I like Sammy Hagar.  I'm hot to teach you.  Are you?  What?  That's a cool thing to sing about.  Being hot for a teacher. 
[03:08:30]  It's got what it takes.  Tell me why.  Kiss this be love.  I'm coming away.  Why?  That Brad Pitt annoys me.  Why?  He's fucking...  How old is he?  He's a 40-flurf.  He fucking looks fantastic.  That bastard.  He's a 40-flurf.  He's not going to look fantastic.  Not in a homo way or anything. 
[03:09:00]  I'm just saying.  I know.  It's annoyingly...  It's okay to say stuff like that.  Like he's annoyingly...  Yeah, but he's not going to look...  ...handsome.  But he's going to get very old fast.  Because now he's up to his 6th or 7th kid.  They just had twins.  They adopted him, don't they?  Oh no, she had...  She just had twin girls.  5 pounds each.  I don't care.  People take care of him for him.  You think he's fucking doing anything for those kids?  They've made 3 kids.  And then they got at least another, what?  2 or 3, right?  He's got 5 or 6 kids already.  Can we talk about how overrated Van Halen is, please? 
[03:09:30]  Yes.  All I'm thinking of right now is fucking...  They have a couple of songs I like.  Jump and Panama.  Wait, I want to see if Anthony likes this one.  What do you think?  See?  Look at his abs.  He's got lovely pecs.  He's got the pecs working.  He's got great hair.  Good chiseled features.  Big cock.  But is he happy?  I bet you he knows how to say no at family functions when the dessert tray comes out.  I bet you.  I bet he doesn't have a lot of carbs during the day.  Oh shit. 
[03:10:00]  How could he?  Angelina's got her mouth on his fucking dick.  He's got her fucking juicy little asshole on his mouth.  He can't eat anything but her fucking corns.  But her fucking ass corns.  She's just sucking the carbs right out of him.  Do you like him from Fight Club days there, Ed?  Wow.  He was ripped in that.  What a body.  Just looked fantastic in Fight Club as Tyler Durden.  Of course.  Yeah.  What a body.  You know, you got to hand it to him.  Here's another shot from Fight Club. 
[03:10:30]  I'm looking at where the pants are pulled down and you can see that hip V that goes right  down into his pubis.  Oh, I thought you were going to say right down into the goodness.  Well, whatever you want to call it.  Again, you can just see that six pack, his ribs on the side and those pecs.  Just amazing.  Not in a gay way.  I'm not saying this.  I'm just saying he's a handsome guy.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys that, oh, yeah.  And here he is. 
[03:11:00]  What movie was that?  I think it's Snatch.  That was in Snatch.  All tatted up.  Yeah.  Just looking really manly.  Again, the abs with his shirt off.  Yeah.  Now, if an actor should have his shirt off, it's Brad Pitt.  I'm not saying this in any way to be or sound gay.  Show Jimmy the fight picture.  I'm just saying that he seems to take good care of himself.  Show him from Snatch.  Because I want to, Jimmy, your body's just like this, right?  Yeah, yours is just like that, right?  Yeah, but he's taller. 
[03:11:30]  And he's got those stupid ridges all over.  Stupid ridges.  What are those?  Oh, muscles.  He looks unhealthy.  Yes, it doesn't look healthy at all.  He doesn't seem to be eating.  He looks like a fucking human zipper.  What the fuck?  How do you get those?  I say no to desserts.  Do you got to say no to every single dessert forever in your whole life?  You got to work out constantly. 
[03:12:00]  You have a trainer.  But I work out.  Yeah, but they have fucking chefs making them tasty desserts that are not fattening.  She cooks me chicken.  Yeah, it's just different.  These have good chefs.  Yours is just some fucking lady who comes to a place where they strike.  Wow, look at that cock.  Come on, that's so photoshopped, is it?  I don't think so.  It looks like an ant, like, I don't know.  Is that?  That's an awful dick.  Well, let's ask the boobie monster out there. 
[03:12:30]  Boobie monster.  Why would he be walking around like that?  Why wouldn't you?  That's not...  It looks fuzzy in photoshopped.  Let's go to Starbucks.  Right below the belly button.  It's Brad Pitt walking again with that six-pack.  But he's got his dick hanging out.  Well, his whole...  He's just naked.  Full frontal nudity.  But I'm not buying it.  I think that was a real pick.  I think there was a problem with that one back in the day.  Yeah, I think there were some lawsuits that happened. 
[03:13:00]  Some issues?  I believe so.  All right.  The me making fucking gay jokes about Brad Pitt Pitt is about done.  Thank you, Danny.  Are you going to show me another?  He found another dick picture of Brad Pitt.  So there you go, Anthony.  Oh, well, that does look like the same dick.  Is he a peeler?  What is he doing?  He's uncut.  Why is he walking around like that?  Why wouldn't he?  I think these were taken on his property.  Yeah, again, why are you walking around naked on your property? 
[03:13:30]  I heard he was like, I don't know, in his backyard or the balcony,  and you had one of these pops in a tree somewhere.  Paparazzi must have been going, holy shit, here's a good one.  Yeah, no kidding.  Girls think he's pretty dreamy.  I mean, Steve.  Yes.  Why don't we take a break from this?  What is this, Steve?  Steve, what are you giving us?  What?  Anthony was asking what you have to eat, 
[03:14:00]  and I found a sample bodybuilding diet for men.  This is what guys have to eat.  Oh.  No, they don't eat that stuff.  What?  What do they eat?  Steroids.  One cup of dry oats mixed with water.  Dry oats and water.  That sounds delicious.  A little oatmeal.  One cup of egg beaters.  Right.  That's at 7 a.m.  And at 9 a.m., meal 2.  A meal replacement packet, like Prolabs, lean mass complex, whatever.  You're just supposed to fucking work.  Or protein.  To lay a protein shake. 
[03:14:30]  Like, what are you, mixing concoctions?  I got a job.  Oh, basically, yeah.  You have to bring all this.  Fucking flaxseed oil.  Who the fuck is flaxseed oil?  Is that pre-cum?  Oh, in that case, that's good for you.  Meal 3.  One cup of brown rice.  When's that?  9.15?  It's at noon.  So by noon.  You've already had three meals.  You've already had three meals by noon.  Okay.  All right.  That's great.  We'll keep with our...  It's impossible.  ...with our little billies.  All right. 
[03:15:00]  We'll break and do something that might be better than this after this.  So stay right there.  We're going to go into game mode today.  Don't worry, we're going to have a fine show.  All right, let me unzip.  That's hot.  I got blood rushing in my mule right now.  That is so hot.  Hey, look at my cock.  Waka waka penis.  Boing.  Boing.  Boing.  Insta boner.  Something touched my mouth.  Jim Norton.  Well, just go ahead.  Give me your cock.  Can I fuck you?  Why not?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Where everybody goes to get young boys.

[03:15:30]  What do you mean?  Just another manic Monday.  I wish it was Sunday.  That's my fun day.  I don't have to run day.  It's just another manic Monday.  Jimmy, you enjoy this song.  Why is Sunday the fun day?  It's not Saturday.  You don't have to get up Sunday.  I can't hear you, Jimmy.  Your mic's not working. 
[03:16:00]  Why is it not on?  It's got to be.  It's the button.  Maybe you're...  I hit the button.  Maybe you pulled the cord out.  I don't push it.  When you pushed the cord in at the bottom of the microphone.  The cord.  I bet because you took it out of the stand, it's fucked up.  Hey, guys.  This just in.  Yes?  Jimmy, does it work, Neo?  No.  Oh, boy.  Give him another mic.  Oh, that's why you're using the wrong mic.  How tired are you? 
[03:16:30]  That's that one.  I was trying to test it.  How's that?  Who wants to guess how many iPhones were sold in the first three Ds?  I'd say 16.  God damn it.  You're right.  Perhaps you're right.  That's too few.  Perhaps I'm right.  That's too few.  It's literal.  Yeah.  Ruin the pit guy.  Yeah, literal Jim.  Yeah, literal Jim.  Yes. 
[03:17:00]  The number is one.  One.  Travis bought it.  Travis bought it.  One million sold in three days since launch.  Yeah, that's just like lunch.  That's just like what satellite radio does.  Oh, ow.  It's like a million.  It takes a year if we'll get a million.  A million in three days.  And those million phones, what can you do with them, Anthony?  Let me tell you.  Why don't you do it right now?  Let me do it.  I'll do it right now.

[03:18:30]  Travis, what happened?  I bought a shitty dog.  What do you think he would know about it?  Oh, hi, Travis.  How are you?  I can hear you.  You couldn't hear me.  Oh, you got your, wait.  Yes?  And now you can try it for free.  Simply call 1-800-201-4007.  Wait, who's what?  Norton.  Hi, Norton.  And you can get any one of their computer lessons.  Are you appin'?  Jimmy Norton's phone is working.  And what, what, are you listening to K-Rock?  Yeah.  But apparently the crack service that they, uh, we all have for our phone.  Yeah.  But I should have mine right now. 
[03:19:00]  It should be working.  Oh, oh, I have the sound off.  See, so it was working.  I had the sound off because I'm cordial around here.  I'm cordial.  My phone's on vibrate.  See?  That's, uh, K-Rock.  Oh, it's too loud.  Hey, look at, it's Joel McHale from, uh, Mother Soup.  No, it's not.  Poking fun with Joel McHale.  All right. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, see?  So, uh.  You can do that with the iPhone.  You can do that with your, uh, with your iPhone.  That might be something that's, uh, very valuable in 78 days from now.  So if anybody wants to hear us.  Yeah.  Uh, we're right there.  Right.  On your iPhone.  All right.  Uh, Danny's saying, play this story, play this story, play this story.  Right, Danny?  Well, it was, uh, it was a big story last week.  I know Jim wanted to hit on it about, uh, some kids that got kicked off of a plane.  Oh, yeah, I just wanted to know, uh, what are you doing?  I thought we were doing this one.  Oh, you want to do that one instead?  Oh, no.  Which one is better? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, I thought that's the one you're going with.  Which one should we do?  Well, let's leave it up to you guys, I guess.  It's either the kids kicked off a plane or the, uh, ex-boyfriend that broke into the  house, too.  Well, first of all, it's disabled kids kicked off flight for unruly behavior.  Well, and that one wins.  Yeah.  Anything disabled in front of it always wins.  Get off your tarts.  All right, let's do with this, uh, I don't know.  Because they can't fight back.  That's why we do it.  Sure they can.  They could pick up a fucking, pick up this console and throw it at you.  Those dumb dolls, I don't know what they're doing. 
[03:20:30]  Put that truck down.  Wendy Slaughter and her four kids are just happy to be in Seattle.  I can't believe we finally made it.  Last night, they were left stranded at the Phoenix airport.  I am furious about it.  I was, I just couldn't believe they could do something like that and then leave us completely  stranded with no money, no way to get anywhere.  On Friday, Slaughter was traveling with her four children and her five-month pregnant sister  on a Southwest flight from Detroit to Seattle.  When the plane landed in Phoenix, the family was met at the gate by police officers, detained 
[03:21:00]  and told they were not allowed to take a connection to Seattle.  Slaughter says this is the very first flight for the children.  She admits the kids were loud and kept getting up and walking around the plane.  The children were a little bit out of control on the flight.  You know, they were restless and excited and worked up and their kids and...  No, you're supposed to fix that, you dummy.  I hate the excuses.  Oh, they're all worked up and excited and running.  They're on a plane and they're this and that and that. 
[03:21:30]  And you're the fucking parent.  Duct tape, whatever it takes.  Shut them the fuck up.  Sit them down.  I've seen kids on planes before.  I've seen well-behaved kids where the parents know.  They go, shh, shut up.  Yeah.  Stop running.  Get in your seat.  Whatever the fuck it takes.  Were you on the plane where we were lucky enough to be in first class and the kid was  yelling and screaming?  Yep.  Oh my God.  Was it you?  Yes, I was.  And then she was trying to teach him a lesson by not giving him the chocolate.  Not giving him the candy.  He was screaming and yelling because all the way to L.A.  because mommy wouldn't give him candy. 
[03:22:00]  And we're all, everybody in first class is like, give the fucking kid the goddamn candy.  That's not the time to teach the kid this candy fucking lesson.  Right.  It's the time to shut him up.  Whatever it takes.  Give him a chocolate-coated Valium.  She decided somewhere 30,000 feet in the air over like, I don't know, Idaho.  It was a perfect time to teach the kid a lesson.  Should have given him the same candy that fucking Hitler was handing out at the end.  I guess.  All right.  Been excited and worked up and their kids. 
[03:22:30]  Her 10-year-old son, Henry, is autistic with a short attention span.  Was he painting, too?  All right.  Cheap joke.  I didn't get it.  Oh, autistic.  I'm not going to.  Oh.  You're trying to get me.  No, no, no.  I didn't get it.  That would be funny if he was just in the aisle painting.  Yeah.  He's artistic.  You mean autistic?  No, he was painting.  He was sculpting.  He was painting the walls of the shit.  Fucking dumb Henry.  But you didn't give it time to sink in to see if he was going to get a laugh.  I just thought it was hacky.  Everyone does the artistic, autistic thing. 
[03:23:00]  I'm trying to stare straight ahead and make noises, Henry.  Henry, I'm trying to do nothing but the same thing over and over, Henry.  Help me out, here.  Help me out, Henry.  I'm trying to eat a pillow.  One dog looking one way, one looking the other.  I'm in the middle going, I don't know what to say.  Yeah.  I'm in the middle having no human contact whatsoever.  Autistic.  With a short attention span.  Her daughter, Gracie, suffers from cerebral palsy.  Oh, boy.  The family says flight attendants.  What a gene pool.  Exactly.  They didn't expect to be booted off the flight. 
[03:23:30]  And off.  She'll be booted off the planet after all the damaged kids.  What an awful womb.  And she was just the mother.  It was just this big, gigantic, fat person.  Of course she was.  Of course she was.  Great, big, fat person.  I think they should compensate us for what's happened.  And I think they should make a public apology.  Southwest spokesperson.  Fuck yourself, fatty.  Get Gilbert Grape off the plane.  And go, fucking.  Exactly.  Sorry your womb is a fucking, just a dumpster for bad DNA. 
[03:24:00]  Apologize that fucking God dumped all these bad fucking chromosomes and genes into one  fucking cesspool of a womb.  Sorry, fatso.  Quit fucking.  Take dicks in the ass or in the back of your neck fold.  Fucking.  Cunt smells like gravy.  Big fatso.  This one's fucked up this way.  That one's that way.  The other kid's got three arms.  She gave birth to a fucking calf. 
[03:24:30]  I'd like to birth that woman with fucking, with catcher's mitts.  Jam both my hands up her box and yank out whatever fucking abomination she's growing now.  Whatever fucking F student she's fucking growing now.  Fucking aircraft disruption.  Jesus.  I bet you when she fucking, when her husband wants sex, he goes, hey, can I stick my dick  and the tax deduction?  Mind if I stick it in the write-off?  Let's make another statistic, honey. 
[03:25:00]  Actually, get down there and lick my idiot factory.  Oh, shit.  You guys want to see a swim walk, huh?  Oh, damn.  Oh, Jimmy, you got it.  I'm too tired, but I'll swim.  But that's a swim walk line right there if I've ever heard one.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Sleepy swim walk.  Sleepy swim walk.  Back to the story.  Apology.  Southwest spokesperson Christy Day told Cairo 7 they were being disruptive and unruly on  the plane.  And for the safety of our customers and the flight crew, we decided to not allow them 
[03:25:30]  to travel on to Seattle at that time.  Typically, if it's a threatening behavior, it's not safe to travel 30,000 feet in the air  in a contained environment.  And when they were in Phoenix, officers bought the family and the kids free McDonald's food.  A Motel 6 manager donated a room.  The grandmother had to pay $2,000 to book the entire family on another flight on Alaska  Airlines back here.  No problems on that flight.  Jesus.  Figured they got the McDonald's. 
[03:26:00]  The fucking mother looked like Grimace.  Bitch.  I hate the mother.  Yeah, settle those kids down.  Yeah, exactly.  Why is that an excuse, though?  Like, in the piece, the mother goes, well, they're kids, but why is that any excuse for  their terrible behavior?  Sometimes it is just an excuse for terrible behavior.  You see them in stores or anywhere you are.  I went to a movie.  Running up and down.  And I'm like, who is allowing this?  What bastard fucking parent is allowing this kid to run up and down an aisle or in a restaurant 
[03:26:30]  or anywhere?  Do you think when the husband is fucking her, all the sperm and the balls know what's happening?  Like, all right.  Who wants to go to stupidville?  I bet they all try to hang out in the balls.  Nobody wants to get dumped there.  They want to get dumped somewhere more productive, like inside of a sock on the back of a hitchhiker  or on a fucking floor in a peep show. 
[03:27:00]  That dopes fucking ovaries.  Just that the ovaries, as soon as the sperm walks up, the ovaries go, up by her.  Like, all right, we know.  The ovaries have two little Pete Rose haircuts on them.  Buck teeth and those idiot propeller hats.  You look at a fucking, a sonogram of her insides and you see all that little propeller hats.  An ovary with propeller hats.  Fucking pinwheels.  They're actually shaped like dumbbells. 
[03:27:30]  Just two fucking circles with a thing attaching them.  Oh my goodness.  And people want to know why you don't get your pilot's license so you don't have to deal  with kids on flights.  You could be like Lee Abrams.  You could be like John Travolta.  Like JFK Jr.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't have enough money to get the kind of plane I would like.  Yeah.  I want a 707 like that fucking Travolta fruit.  Oh, like that fucking, that hat wig he wears.  That fucking thing.  Try to sneak all that young cock on the plane. 
[03:28:00]  Ixnay on the airport security A.  He wants to fucking just, he wants to blowjob.  He's the only guy that has to fucking look at the top of clouds to get head.  Yeah, he's got to be 35,000 feet up to get fucking gay sex from men.  You fly the plane, keep the curtain closed.  I'll be eating all these asses back here.  I don't know where the paparazzi is.  Suck my dick.  We're at 35,000 feet.  Let's say hi to Brian in Colorado.  Brian.  What's up, fellas? 
[03:28:30]  Right on.  Hey, I was on a flight on Southwest going from Vegas and they wouldn't let this woman  continue because she smelled so bad.  And they took her off the flight.  He said she had to clean herself up.  Oh, that's a good one right there.  Nice.  It smelled the whole plane up.  It was terrible.  They should have fucking hosed her down like an elephant.  Like with a fire hose that didn't escape from Alcatraz after fucking Clint Eastwood had a fight.  Warden don't like smelly inmates. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, he's gone.  Should have let her depart the plane like Omar departed the helicopter.  Open the emergency door.  Fucking kick fat cell in her moist pits out.  You're pitting out, lady.  You're bugging everyone.  Oh, wow.  All our Miley Cyrus nude pics have been answered.  Whatever that means, Paul.  Oh, not Shirehorst.  What?  Remember Paul Shirehorst?  He's a regular on NSF Feedback. 
[03:29:30]  Basically saying a hacker got to Miley Cyrus' phone and is now shopping naked photos of Miley Cyrus.  Nice.  She has a wet t-shirt photo online right now.  Yeah, I think you've seen that.  I love her to fucking take a dump in my lap and then feel guilty and cry.  I'm like, oh, it's okay.  This girl just wants to be dirty, man.  She's a fucking naughty one.  She just wants to be dirty.  Can't wait till she blows that Disney money, does some fucking porn, and then maybe gets a Monsterain DVD and tickles my bag when she's 20. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, poor Billy Ray.  Oof.  All right, here we go.  He's got to look at his naked daughter like that.  If I took the pictures.  That's true.  Guys, we got this from Hirsch.  We're all bombing in unison.  Well, that's why.  This is like stereo bombing.  That's why we move over here for 40 seconds.  We got Hirsch.  I bombing and you bombing and fucking an echo.  Sorry.  Echo bombing.  Crazy kitchen gadgets.  They got the fork that spins for you so you can get the spaghetti on the fork.  Put in your mouth and rip your fucking tonsils out.  Put that in someone's asshole and fucking press the button and chew up their ass skin. 
[03:30:30]  You know that thin asshole skin?  Which is why he hates it.  It was so fucking prevalent.  You wrap fucking asshole skin around your fork and then eat it.  Fucking asshole.  It'd be like a Funyun.  Oh, that is really disgusting.  Oh my God.  I guess that's disgusting.  It gets the egg white out of the egg, but it's shaped like a man's head in a mug.  And it comes out of his nostrils. 
[03:31:00]  The egg whites.  It looks like snot.  Yep.  That's wonderful.  And here's Miss USA fucking falling again.  Oh, God.  And Miss Venezuela.  No, that's Miss Venezuela accepting our fucking crown.  Oh, shit.  It's so fucking ridiculous.  Fucking fucking...  God, it's so fucking hot that dude to Miss Venezuela.  Fucking Venezuela.  Where's the fucking camel toe?  Right in the shit box.  All right.  Hey, here's Hirsch from Jersey.  Tic-tac-toast.  Oh, even the name's funny.  Ew.  Tic-tac-toast? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Fucking crazy kitchen gadgets, people.  What's crazy about that?  It's more zany.  There's nothing crazy about that.  And then we got...  What is this?  We got knives.  All right.  Here's a Hirsch in Jersey.  Oh, it's Steve making noises. 
[03:32:00]  Well, the best one yet.  Do we have the metallic one on hand?  Can we do that really fast?  Steve's noises. 
[03:32:30]  He was just doing that into a microphone?  All right.  Here's the metallic one.  This is my favorite.  Go.  Go.  How did it go?  How did it go?  Come?  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, yes.  Come on. 
[03:33:00]  Come on.  No.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  No.  Come on.  Come on.  No.  Three.  Time,ir.  I have to sing, I have to fly.  All right.  Oh, name.  Oh, можно.  Oh, how do I live?  Oh, you got to die.  Telling myself.  Bye, man.  Oh, hey.  Well, we couldn't fully enjoy the Metallica Stephen remix, 
[03:33:30]  Steve Noy's remix, because Jimmy turned around  I didn't notice that, we did a little hocus pocus on the audience  I got a text from my friend, and she goes, why were we asked to leave?  A little hocus pocus on the audience, they're gone  We didn't even know, we look up and they're like, poof, they're gone 
[03:34:00]  What happened?  What happened, Steve?  Poe asked if he could send the audience home, because he does that when he goes and gets Anthony's car  What?  And then, and I said, please, I said, unless you hear otherwise, then go ahead  And he didn't hear otherwise, and then I guess some of the people there were Jimmy's friends  So he's going back downstairs and getting them right now  It's just amazing  There's no one  Amazing  Is there any surprise?  Nobody knows what the fuck is going on 
[03:34:30]  The right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing  Fucking knows, I don't get it  How is a fucking show run like this?  Holy shit  I don't get it  If I was just fucked up doing stand-up, not showing up for gigs, and fucking doing ten minutes and then walking off  I would be fucking, I don't get it  Chasing the audience away  I'm just cranky because I'm so tired, man  I'm almost tired  It's true  I just don't get it  It's so true  Is there any surprise that Eric Logan is leaving this place? 
[03:35:00]  We should take a cue from him and jump overboard with him  But if there's no organization among us  It's not even them  There doesn't  Everyone's been told this fucking 50 times, you check  Steve, comment  I thought he'd blame us  Basically, Jimmy's blaming you  No, I'm really not  He's being polite, but he is  I'm more annoyed that Poe sent them away because I've gone over this with Poe before  Well, Poe is not that smart  There's no reason  That's your first mistake, thinking that he actually has a brain 
[03:35:30]  There's no reason he can't, like, get the vehicle  And then come back up  Right  Leave an intern down there, whatever  Right  Just to watch that it doesn't get towed  Right  And come back up  And for, you know, ten minutes  Leave the audience here  They've been checked  Right  It's fucking rain  I think we're okay  Right  I don't think we need, you know  Right  You have to be very specific with Poe  And I, you know, he didn't check  And he was told  Please make sure that nobody's friends are in the audience 
[03:36:00]  Or, you know, make sure that they don't have a problem with it  Why would we have a system in place after two years?  I mean, there really wouldn't be any reason for us to have one  I don't mean to laugh, Jimmy  No, you're right  It's just hearing the truth like this is, uh  It just, it hits me like that  They were having fun, too  We looked up  Oh, I know  Hocus  Hocus Pocus  Yeah  They're just gone  They stood in the rain to come see us  What the fuck?  Was David Copperfield out there decided to try out his new trick?  Yeah, look  They're gone  Wow  It's amazing 
[03:36:30]  Right before our very eyes  Yeah  This shit happens all the time  Yeah, well, you know  Nobody knows what anybody's doing  Nobody knows what anybody's doing  So  Should we do this story or should we do that?  I gotta go anyway  I don't care  I gotta ENT for my nose  Where are you going, Jimmy?  Ear, nose, and taint?  Yeah  That would be an odd thing  Yes  You know, we have one of those doctors  Yeah, actually, he did 
[03:37:00]  What happened?  You had an ear, nose, and taint, doctor  I finally had to give up on it  You decided  Doctor, uh, finger up the asshole  Had to get rid of doctor, finger up the asshole  Yeah, my doctor, um  Gave me, uh  Uh  I have to get, um  You know, my cholesterol checked  Mm-hmm  So he gives  Writes out the prescription  He goes, okay, you know  Mm-hmm  Go here or go wherever and get this  He goes, I'm gonna put you down for a prostate exam, too  I'm like, what?

[03:38:00]  And then you come over the table  Let me come  As soon as that fucking finger gets pulled out  And a load just fucking  It's probably a milky, salty  Big, nasty load  All over the fucking wax paper he's got on the  The wax paper  On the fucking exam table  See, I was being polite waiting for you to finish  Cause that was, I swear, I gotta say  That was my line  But I was being polite  Like I just jump in there  I have a question, though  Like, how come, like, technology has progressed so far  Especially in medicine  Like, you can even  Thank you  You can even take, like, an infant's temperature 
[03:38:30]  With, like, a laser beam thing  It doesn't even go in their ear  Or that you just point it at them  It gives you  Why do you have to physically put your  Your fingers in someone else's asshole?  What the?  Thank you, Danny  Why?  There's no reason for it  People can write an iPhone  They have to check it  They don't fucking check your tonsils  With their fingers  They put a flashlight in there  I'll tell you why, the doctor's bored  Is that it?  I mean, gay, he's just bored  I think the doctors all have  They're in cahoots  To just keep this going  As a goof  Yep  It's like a joke  Like, can you believe people come in 
[03:39:00]  To have us stick their fingers  Up their ass  And there's machines out there  That we can do this  And then they show off this shit  Under their fingernails  To each other  So how many did you do today?
