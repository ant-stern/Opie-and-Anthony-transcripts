<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's "Worst of 2013" broadcast, hosted by E-Rock, was a chaotic and often vulgar compilation of clips from the year's broadcasts.  The show heavily featured Mike Buschetti, the announcer for the Artie Lange Show.  Buschetti recounted his experiences in the Marines (including profane anecdotes about his drill instructors), his agoraphobia, getting hopelessly lost in Staten Island (requiring Pete Davidson to drive him home after a show because he didn't know his own address), his eccentric neighborhood, his hatred of Christmas shopping, and his encounters with aggressive Russian pedicab drivers.  He also shared embarrassing childhood stories, including wearing mismatched shoes to school and a negative interaction with a high school classmate.  Buschetti's stories were filled with offensive language and sexually explicit humor.

Another prominent segment featured Otto Peterson of the comedy duo Otto and George, describing his hospitalization after a severe inner ear infection, resulting hallucinations, memory loss, bizarre dreams, and combative behavior at an airport.

The show then launched into a scathing critique of the Scott and Todd morning show on PLJ.  Opie, Anthony, and E-Rock ridiculed Scott’s perceived senility, Todd’s affected Brooklyn accent, and their strained on-air chemistry.  Extended clips showcased Scott’s confused attempts to discuss a movie he repeatedly misidentified as "The Boat Movie," and Todd's prank calls, which were deemed unoriginal and derivative of the Jerky Boys.  These calls often involved nonsensical names and lacked humor.

A graphic clip of a staff member, Sal, undergoing a waxing procedure was played, followed by a discussion of Sal's subsequent actions, including putting the used wax on a coworker's head.  A conflict between Sal and Denny, another staff member, over Sal's perceived lack of respect for Denny's radio experience, was also aired.

The broadcast then shifted to a vulgar discussion about a poorly-received radio segment, leading to a joke about spanking Sal by Troy, which escalated into a physical altercation resulting in Sal's accidental injury.  A heated argument between Sal and Travis over unfinished work assignments followed, filled with insults and accusations of laziness.  The hosts and other staff members fueled the conflict.

The show then transitioned to anecdotes about celebrity encounters, including a failed attempt to interact with William Shatner and a brief meeting with Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroeger, both peppered with off-color remarks.  A significant portion focused on Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, including excerpts of his sexually explicit text messages with a female intern and commentary from the hosts and staff, along with audio from Weiner's press conference.  Jackie and Kenny "Club Soda Kenny" provided comedic voice acting of Weiner’s explicit texts with the intern.

Actor James Caan then appeared as a guest in studio. The conversation ranged from his new ABC show, "Back in the Game," to his experiences filming "The Godfather," including anecdotes about Marlon Brando and other cast members.  Caan also shared personal stories, often using colorful language.

A large segment focused on Dennis Falcone's inappropriate behavior.  Nicole, a pregnant co-worker, and her husband, Matt Biggins, were in studio to discuss Falcone's insensitive comments about the possibility of stillbirth.  The show then detailed Falcone's actions at the company holiday party, including asking a young female coworker to photocopy her ass, soliciting kisses, and suggesting a trip to a strip club.  Falcone was brought in to defend himself, claiming his actions were "in character" and fueled by alcohol.  His explanations were challenged by the hosts and co-workers who recounted additional anecdotes of Falcone's inappropriate behavior at the party.  A caller, "Tommy" from Hits One, corroborated some of the allegations via a tweet.  The hosts also discussed a picture taken at the party that further fueled the discussion, and playfully suggested implementing a "Dennis Falcone Rule."  Eric and Roland were also present in studio during this segment, and a caller named Lauren also contributed details about the holiday party. The show concluded with continued discussion surrounding Falcone's actions and the overall inappropriateness of his behavior.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission. James Lipton. A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shit face buffoonery. E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry. And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass.  What the fuck happened?  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Welcome to another week of the Worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony Show.  My name is E-Rock. E-Rock Radio on Twitter. 
[00:00:30]  And I will be hosting this upcoming week.  Week 2. Day 6 of the Worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony program.  On today's show, lots of great stuff.  The return of Otto Peterson from Otto and George.  We look back at Jocktober.  One of the more prominent shows that has been featured every year.  Scott and Todd.  This has definitely been a big year for Sal.  We'll get into that.  William Shatner returns to the show.  We also meet Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroger from Nickelback.  We go over the Anthony Wiener sex that he sent out.  We reenact those.  James Kahn is on the show. 
[00:01:00]  I don't know how the hell that happened.  And then we look back at the year of 2013 for our own Dennis Falcone.  He had some slip-ups there that we'll get to a little bit later.  But for right now, we're going to start with Mike Buschetti.  2013 was the year Mike Buschetti became somewhat of a regular on the Opie and Anthony Show.  He's the announcer for the Artie Lang Show.  And Mike has made a series of stellar appearances this year on the program.  In this collection here, you're going to hear Mike talk about his time in the Marines,  getting lost going home to Staten Island,  and some of his favorite words.  Here it is.  Our new best friend, Mike Buschetti.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013. 
[00:01:30]  Tom, I joined the Marines when I was young.  How do you join the Marines for a short period of time?  Well, it was a mutual agreement that I left, actually.  You never do that.  Bygones be bygones?  There's never a mutual agreement.  It was like, you know, they were like, well, you know, the minute I get off the bus, all hell broke loose.  Was it after the whole platoon hit you with the soap?  No, I just thought after this.  I got off the bus and all, this was like 1980. 
[00:02:00]  What do you mean all hell broke loose?  A jelly donut!  Break it down.  What happened?  You had to run up to, like, yellow footprints.  And we would say, sir, yes, sir, right?  And by mistake, well, first of all, when they got on the bus, the guy looked like Ollie Ermic.  For sure.  Sure.  And he goes, you're now propping the United States government.  You're now propping the United States Marine Corps.  You got three seconds to get off this bus.  So guys are pushing, fighting to get off.  I'm like the last guy off the bus.  I figure, fuck, let me take my time.  You know, I'll get out there when I'm ready to get out there. 
[00:02:30]  You know what I mean, right?  So I get out there, and they say, when you hear your name, you'll say, sir, yes, sir.  So I went, yes, sir.  He goes, he looked at me, he goes, who's a dick sucker that got a cock?  He caught down his throat and said, yes, sir.  Instead of, sir, yes, sir, he goes, wasn't you, Liberace?  And I go, Liberace?  I go, sir, he goes, your name is Milton Bradley from now on Sunday.  Some of the games played with you.  You're never going to want to come back.  Milton Bradley.  Oh, wow.  But when I met my drill instructor, he goes, I will turn you into Lee Harvey Oswald by the time of this. 
[00:03:00]  Jesus Christ.  He had to make you more, like, he had to put you on medication and make you more sane to make you awesome.  It was great, because, like...  So how long were you in?  I was in for six weeks, the first phase of training.  Then they decided to, you know...  How'd they break it to you?  The guy said, well, this isn't really working out for us.  Well, you were really...  Wow.  Did he lose weight?  Were you...  No, I was in good shape.  You were in pretty good shape?  When, actually...  But what do you mean they said it didn't work out? 
[00:03:30]  Like, what'd you do?  They said, well, you know, you're not actually right for this.  You know what I mean?  Because the Marines didn't hate everybody.  They never say that.  Even if they just want some cannon fodder.  Were they mean to you or no?  No, they were actually...  By mistake, one day...  They must have went to the recruiter and just went, what the fuck are you thinking?  I haven't seen...  You know, we didn't see women for a few weeks, because you're down there and then...  I know, you were horny as fuck.  Oh, yeah, I seen women...  I seen some women Marines that, like...  Looked like Vulcans from Star Trek.  I didn't give a shit what they looked like.  I'm checking them out.  And everything you had to say was, sir, yes, sir, right? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, it is.  So, that woman Marine comes over to me, right?  Uh-oh.  And I go to her, sir.  Uh-oh.  I called her, sir, right?  She goes, do I look like a sir to you?  I go, sir!  So, all of a sudden, my drill and sergeant stops the platoon.  Right?  He goes...  Uh-oh.  And my nickname was Space Cookie.  That's how he called me.  He goes, Space Cookie.  I knew this had a feel.  He goes, what the hell do you...  You gotta get that on a shirt, who, kid?  Space Cookie.  You gotta get Space Cookie on a shirt.  He goes, what did he do now?  He goes, what did he do now?  I'll buy one of those. 
[00:04:30]  He said he called me sir instead of ma'am.  So, he looked at her and said, that mistake is understandable.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  But he was on my side for once.  Well, it was probably more fun for him to goof on the bitch than it was you at that point.  Yeah.  Right there.  I was...  When I got there, I'm like, I thought this was gonna be John Wayne charging over the hill.  I'd get chicks, beat up bullies, and picked up when I came back.  Oh, man.  It was more like John Wayne Gacy.  I thought I'd get hot chicks, like, beat up bullies, and picked up me.  Yikes.  You know, they're like Marines and stuff like that.  Didn't work out that way for you, huh?  No.  Oh, God. 
[00:05:00]  Because when I got there, they were like...  He gave us a speech.  It was like...  He said, my name is Sergeant Rivers.  I'll do the speech.  It was like...  Please do the speech.  Really get into it, too.  He goes, my name is Sergeant Rivers.  You will refer to me as sir.  For the next 12 weeks, I will be your mom, dad, boyfriend, girlfriend, bisexual, pimpin' bitch.  He goes, my primary objective is to teach you to kill.  And I'm like, wait, that last part.  My primary objective is to teach you to kill.  I didn't realize that was a job over there.  You know what I mean?  I thought... 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, you're gonna kill motherfuckers, man.  Yeah, I thought, you know...  I thought, hey, man, it would be cool just wearing a uniform, beating up.  You guys would beat up on me.  You know what I mean, right?  I didn't realize it was like...  What did you think the Marine Corps did?  That's like what they do is kill.  Kill motherfuckers, man.  I didn't realize it was that intense.  Oh, my God.  That intense.  The whole history of the Marines are killing people.  I got a joke.  Killing the scenes.  I just screwed up.  That's how I got the name Space Cookie.  Joke yourself.  What'd you do?  How'd you get Space Cookie?  My accommodation lock, you know, to give you a lock.  It was messed up. 
[00:06:00]  So it wasn't working right from the second I got it.  Oh, no.  An unlocked footlocker.  I'm in Scradbeck trying to open it.  I'm still in my underwear.  Everybody else is in the squad chowhole eating.  He came back from there.  And he just came out with the name because they're so good at improv and people and breaking  balls.  He goes, Space Cookie.  He goes, you're ruining my Marine Corps, son.  You're ruining...  He said that.  He grabbed my face as red as an apple.  He goes, next time I will kill you, bitch.  Wow.  And I'm like... 
[00:06:30]  And he meant it.  Really, really?  He did.  Damn.  Why was your fucking lock...  So you're in your underpants trying to unlock your locker?  I'm like fucking a window like this.  Everybody else is eating.  I'm like, damn, miss.  Why can't I open this?  Got fucked with this lock.  I hope that he's not fucking looking for me now.  Wow.  Did he get it open?  No.  They actually gave me a couple of different punishments over there.  Oh, what were some of the punishments?  One day, by mistake, I said to a drill instructor, sir, good morning, sir.  It was like early in the afternoon. 
[00:07:00]  Is that crazy?  Right?  I go, sir, good morning.  He goes, does it look like a morning to you?  He goes, who do you belong to?  He goes, sir, I'm in the 3rd Battalion, spilling my guts.  And he goes, I'm going to teach you a lesson from now on.  He gave me like a plastic stopwatch he had.  He goes, you're going to be the official timekeeper of the 3rd Battalion.  I had him walk back and forth.  And he goes, and your name's going to be Big Ben, son.  You have a lot of names.  No, he goes.  Crazy AKA.  Yeah, yeah.  He had me in front of the thing.  I had to say, my name is Big Ben. 
[00:07:30]  I'm the official timekeeper of the 3rd Battalion.  I screwed up and told drill instructor Smith it was morning and afternoon.  But in the meantime, he got some guy laughing at me.  Uh-oh.  And he made him, he said, after I got done with that, this guy had to say,  and my name is Baradis.  I laughed at him.  That's what he made me say.  So, Br'er Rabbit?  Barabbis, you know, from the Crucifixion.  They made him say that.  Oh, Br'er Rabbit.  It was a Br'er Rabbit first.  No, and then he called, so, I'm standing there walking back and forth, right?  Meanwhile, other platoons of drill instructors are coming over to me, 
[00:08:00]  and they're like, here's an example of what not to do.  You know what I mean?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You know.  How'd you do as far as like marksmanship and stuff?  Good.  I still, I had a rifle and shotgun permit until like the mid-80s or late-80s.  I still didn't go to range.  Unfortunately, I, you know, got rid of all my weapons at home.  Why?  Is he considered a vet?  Yeah, are you a vet?  Are you a shot in the ass?  I get some, you know, some, they tried to, you know, get me vet insurance to buy a house,  but I don't know.  How was your, what kind of discharge did you get? 
[00:08:30]  I got an honorable.  Honorable after six weeks?  And all these memories.  It was awesome because I, I learned, I learned that, you know, you're not an, you thought  as a unit, not an individual.  I learned that pretty fast.  In six weeks.  That's crazy.  So what happened to all your weapons?  How come you got rid of them?  I had a, I just used to go to range a lot.  My mom was, I guess, you know, my mom was like, why do you need this many guns in the  house?  I'm like, well, you know, I like your target shooting, really.  Yeah.  Not people shooting, you know?  Well, no. 
[00:09:00]  That's the, you know.  Did you have a six pack when you were in army?  I was in good shape.  I was about 155 out.  155.  What do you know?  Oh God, I'm an obese piece of fat crap.  I don't know.  So you have this guy, Pete Davidson.  He was on the after show with Sam Roberts and he relayed a little story about Mike Machete  who's standing by.  Um, but we got a clip from, um, uh, that appearance.  Yes.  Just to set this up for everybody.  It's quick. 
[00:09:30]  So we have permission to air it, air this.  I hope so.  We have written express permission from Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I generally don't like my stuff being played on other shows.  Christ.  Hoo, hoo.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hoo, hoo.  Say, I met him.  So you're 17 at this club called the Looney Bin in Staten Island.  And we did a show and then.  Talking about Mike Machete, obviously.  For the people that weren't listening earlier.  And I had to drive him home.  And he doesn't know where he lives. 
[00:10:00]  No, this is a true story.  Like we were, he was like, yeah, I live on a forest Avenue and we went to forest Avenue  and he goes, Pete, this is so embarrassing.  And I was like, I don't live here anymore.  And I was like, where do you live, Mike?  He goes, I live by a gas station.  And I was like, there's a lot of gas stations.  A gas station.  Yeah.  But it's in Staten Island.  It's in Staten Island.  So there's only 30 gas stations that we have to drive by.  But no, it was.  So how did you find his place?  We had to call his mom.  No.  And his mom was like, Michael, how long have we been living? 
[00:10:30]  He's like 48.  I know what you're saying.  He's an adult man.  So he was like, Michael, how long have we lived at this house?  And he goes, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And you're going like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  And then I just went home after that and went to school the next day.  So there you have it.  That's bizarre, man.  So I said to Sam, we got to get Mike Pichetti on the freaking show to get his side of the story.  Yeah.  So without further ado, we welcome Mike Pichetti to the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Mike? 
[00:11:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  We're doing all right, man.  You know, the holidays are right around the corner.  We're shopping.  Oh, boy.  Oh, good, guys.  I hate shopping for holidays.  I just, like, send my brother out to get stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't like going shopping.  I hate, I can't stomach at the beginning with guys.  It's like, and it's even worse now.  Why can't you stomach Christmas shopping?  I like Christmas, but it's like, you know, people all over the place, they're pushing and shoving.  And it's like, it's like when it rains out in Midtown, the umbrella people, I call them.  I just like, I don't like havoc that much. 
[00:11:30]  I just want to be in and out and just go fast, you know?  Are you a little agoraphobic?  I could be, yes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I am.  I am.  Anthony, that's right, because I forgot, you know, like, I don't really like, believe it  or not, I'm kind of shy when it comes to not being a comic, but I know what you mean by  you are a phobic.  I was like, you know, if I stand around people for two, you know what I mean, I get kind of  awkward.  So you don't believe in the baby Jesus?  No, I totally do.  I love him.  He's one of my, you know, he's the number one guy. 
[00:12:00]  You love the baby Jesus.  You're all in with that, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I like the holidays a lot, but I just hate the stress to them.  Yeah.  So what happened with Pete Davidson?  Oh, he's a character.  I love Pete.  First of all, I met him, he's a great comic.  I met him, like, three or four years ago.  He started comedy at about 15.  So what happened was, I had moved recently a couple of times on Staten Island in the past,  you know, couple of years.  And where I live now, oh, God, I'll describe this area to you guys. 
[00:12:30]  It's like the witness protection program where I am.  I'm at the end of my block, at that end street.  Hardly anybody speaks English here.  I'm on the third floor living up in an attic to my mother's house here.  It's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm in another country where time's on it.  What do you mean by they don't speak English?  Where do they speak?  Probably, it could be Russian or Slobic.  A lot of former Soviet fucking republics. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  And I just, you know, it could be Albanian.  I don't know.  They all speak pretty close to the same stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, those people are very scary, man.  Yeah.  I see them.  I see the fathers at the playgrounds here in New York City.  Yeah.  I'm way more scared of them than black people.  The Russians.  Than black people.  I'll be honest with you.  Huh?  I'm scared more of them than the Italians.  They are fucking intimidating.  No, they wouldn't.  And they're at the playground with their young children, which is just all festive and nice. 
[00:13:30]  But how they talk, even in those circumstances, do you know they're in business?  They would kill you.  Right.  They come into people, they're obnoxious, they're like, I don't know.  I am scared of them, it's right, because I'm a feck.  I just don't want to be tied to a log on the Hudson River.  Yeah, they are a little nasty when they drive their stupid pedicabs around.  A lot of Russians doing that.  I can't even fit in one, but it's like...  Yeah.  The guy would fucking just be like, oh boy, this is not going anywhere. 
[00:14:00]  No, they'd be like, oh no, I got to go to my chiropractor.  Yes.  They look cool to ride in, but I know I could never fit in and out of one night.  Do they really look cool to ride in, though?  They look horrendous.  I want a heater.  I want fast transportation.  I want a little bit of metal around me, just in case something happens.  Those fucking things, you couldn't get me in one of those things if it was the only way to get around.  No fucking way. 
[00:14:30]  I'm having some guy pedal me up and down the streets.  What year is this, first of all?  Where are we?  Saigon?  I don't need it.  This is an 1812 Manchuria.  Yes, Manchuria.  And they're more expensive than a cab ride.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, way more expensive.  So you're out in the freezing cold going, what, five miles an hour to your destination?  Yeah.  And then you get out and it's like a hundred bucks.  I can crawl faster.  I told one guy, he came by me twice once, and he goes, right? 
[00:15:00]  I'm like, no, I said, I'm going to fucking Brooklyn.  Right.  You want to pedal your ass across the fucking bridge?  And then he got all pissed at me.  Oh, no, and they're obnoxious.  Fuck you, you fucking.  You said that?  Yeah, yeah, he got mad.  We squared off, almost had a fight.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I love this.  You're Italian.  I love it.  We got that, like, you know, like, I got that, like, you know, if you say no to somebody  wants, it should be no.  I don't want to ride.  I'm nice, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They just keep going around the block and looking at you. 
[00:15:30]  In the dirt.  I know.  They make you feel like you're on display.  Those guys and the guys that try to sell you the rose when you're with a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, man, rose, rose for the lovely lady.  You can shut up.  Don't try to put me up on the spot, you jerk off.  And then he looked like a piece of shit because you didn't buy the rose.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not buying your shitty rose.  So, Pete, that's where you live now?  You live in the attic of your mom's house?  Yeah.  Or Mike.  Yeah.  Why the attic?  Who's living in the rest of the house? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, it's a great situation.  Me and my brother.  It's a great situation.  Yeah.  He came downstairs with his brother's, with his son.  And then my brother has, like, a dog downstairs.  It's, like, a five-pound chihuahua.  So they let the dog in the house, but not you.  You have to be in the attic.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I kind of like the attic.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Does it have a window, at least?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  The window's pretty good.  Is it small?  One of those small ones?  It's medium-sized.  I can look at the back of a swamp over here. 
[00:16:30]  Do you have that roof, though, where you can only walk in the middle?  Right.  Because it's pitched down on each side?  I know.  It's like I was always, when I lived in my family, I was always in the attic or the basement.  I never, like, lived in a neutral floor.  You never lived in the house.  You're always...  Oh, my God.  Ah, shit.  Not good.  They always, like, keep them in the attic or the basement.  Yeah.  So the story that Pete Davidson's talking about, that's from a while ago?  Oh, yeah.  This is probably a couple years ago. 
[00:17:00]  So what happened was, I go, Pete, but, you know, he drove me home.  He started driving me home, and I go, wait a minute.  I don't live here all day.  Oh, darn.  I don't know how to get here from there.  Because we, like, way on Stead Island is, like, where's an expressway.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, there's areas I don't know out here.  I mean, it's only 7 by 13.  I'm like, Pete, I think we've got to go back this way.  And then we started, like, driving into the hood.  And I'm like, no, this isn't it either.  Oh, my God.  You were lost going to your own house. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, wait, wait.  This is the hood, man.  I don't live close to this.  I'm like, I like these people, but I don't want to be killed over here.  You know what I mean?  So.  Yeah.  The cop sees you driving around those areas, thinks you're buying drugs.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Especially me, because a friend of mine told me that one time, Anthony, he said, you know,  Mike, he said, you'll be safe in the hood.  He goes, you look like you're at the range, copper, a member of the mafia.  I'll leave you alone.  Mm, well.  I don't know.  I think they'll still fuck you up.  But.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good luck to you.  Keep up your good nature. 
[00:18:00]  Then I get out of the hood, and I'm like, oh, wait, Pete, no, it's not this way.  Oh, yeah, I think it might be, because I haven't been over here in a while.  Oh, my God.  He said it was near a, you said that it was near a gas station.  Oh, yeah.  And, but there's a bunch of gas stations on Staten Island, so would you just look at every  gas station until you recognized one?  They have, like, 80 gas stations with, like, pizzerias inside.  You know what I mean?  That's what they have over here.  Is that what goes on in Staten Island? 
[00:18:30]  Oh, God, yeah, it's ridiculous, but then we started getting close to the house.  I'm like, wait a minute, Pete, I think this is the, you know, and I'm like, no, damn it,  we're a few miles away from this.  Pete must have been like, fuck, I gotta fucking go through this shit, but he's a kid.  Right, he can't say anything.  Yeah, he wants an in and the comedy thing, and.  Oh, yeah, he was thinking, you know, he said that he goes, who are your friends in this?  Oh, man.  You know, but he's a good kid, though, but I mean, but guys, it's been, it's been good. 
[00:19:00]  I got up like three days in a row to call you guys.  I know.  Yeah, well.  Well, our studio was busted, so we apologize.  I felt so bad, I'm like, this is horrible, because, you know, and I got up the first day,  and I'm like, okay, you know.  Then the next day I got up, I had like six hours sleep in the past three days, but I got  up, and I went back to bed, and I just like, it's worth every minute, though, I love you  guys.  Wait, you stay up late every night?  No, I get home about two, but I kept waking myself up, because I don't want to oversleep. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  So I drank a ton of water, kept running up, going to the bathroom.  Is that what you do to stay?  Yeah, yeah, to keep myself awake.  I'm like, I'm like drinking all kinds of water, I'm like, oh, God, I'm laying in bed,  like twisting to turn and going, Anthony's going to punch me in the face if he grabs me  if I'm late, you know what I mean?  That's funny.  He's going to put me in a headlock here.  That's what the Indians used to do.  No, I'm like, oh, damn.  So they would get up early in the morning.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  That was their alarm clock, yeah.  Really?  They figured out how much water to drink right before bed, and that would make you wake up 
[00:20:00]  at the proper time.  But they were in shape, though.  They were.  They all had abs and stuff.  There were no fat Indians.  You could wear a loincloth with pride.  That's right.  You weren't trying to hide your moobs.  No.  Indians didn't have moobs.  I can't hide my moobs, guys.  I've got to tie them down with a rope.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  But we finally found my house.  Yeah.  Thank God for that.  And I was like, Pete, I'm so sorry, you know, but now you'd have to put your GPS on because  I want to go back to your house from here.  Well, I'm sure at that point he wasn't worried about it anymore.  He was just glad he got rid of you.  No, it was different, but he...  So he had GPS, but you didn't even know your address?  No, I was like, wait a minute.  No, this isn't it.  I'm like, oh, wait.  No, I could understand if you didn't know how to get from where you were to where you 
[00:21:00]  had to be because you were new in that area or something, but to have GPS and you just  didn't know the numbers and the word that make up an address, that's kind of...  I know, I called my mom up and she was like ticked off.  It was like late because the show ran late.  I'm like, what's the new address again?  She goes, it's fly, you idiot.  That's only the beginning because when we first moved here, I locked myself out of my room  by mistake. 
[00:21:30]  Uh-huh.  How did that happen?  There was a key and I'm like, and all of a sudden they come home, right?  Yeah.  And my mom's a very good person, but she's also super biting and sarcastic, which she  has to be, right?  So I'm coming home.  I see her look on her face and I go, what happened?  Did somebody die?  And she goes, it should only be that simple.  Oh.  Oh, geez.  I go, what do you mean?  She goes, and I'm looking at my door and she's jimmying it with a butter knife trying  to open it.  She has my brother trying to pull it down.  You know what I mean?  It's like, we called my friend up in the middle of the night. 
[00:22:00]  It's like a plumber that came.  I waited a few hours for him to jimmying my door open.  She was, oh God.  And that was one of the first things that happened.  Why'd she have to get in there if you weren't home?  No, because I was just locked out.  I couldn't go back in the room myself.  Oh.  And my sleep apnea machine was in there and everything.  Oh, wow.  Well, you need that.  Oh, yes.  She's like, she goes, she was like freaking out.  She's like, you called me in the middle of the night.  Look what happened.  I'm like, but I just, I didn't realize I had the key. 
[00:22:30]  I always lose keys, guys.  Very easily.  I break keys and doors by mistake.  I lose them.  We get to one.  It sounds like it's exhausting to be you.  Sounds like at any turn, something's going wrong.  Yes.  Just basic stuff about to go wrong.  Oh, I actually, you know, by mistake, like months ago at work, I wore two, I told you  I wore two different colored shoes to work by mistake.  Right.  So I can dress in the dark.  I'm like, now I make sure I have at least the light on when I'm getting dressed.  Oh, well, that's good.  So you're learning. 
[00:23:00]  Turn the light on when you get dressed.  Right.  So you don't walk out of the house with two different shoes.  Something good.  I moved up in the wrong place.  Didn't the shoes feel different on your feet?  No, they were both, my feet are like 11 wide, so they both fit, but what?  And I was like, wait a minute.  Because I was like in a rush.  But how, hold on, hold on.  How different were the shoes, though?  Were they like two brands of Nikes, but two different colors, or were they too drastic?  A Florsheim dress shoe and a moccasin.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it was like a black and like a sort of brownish.  Dress shoes you go with, or pinning loafers? 
[00:23:30]  What do you wear?  Dress shoes, I got to get sneakers.  I love them, but my feet are too fat for sneakers now.  Uh-oh.  They don't make fat sneakers?  I like an 11 wide.  I went into it like, you've got to make fat sneakers.  How are the fat people supposed to lose weight if they don't make fat sneakers?  Ah, what a conundrum.  That's like a Seinfeld thing happening right there.  They don't want us to lose weight, because think about it.  There's a nation of obesity, and they don't want, you know what I mean?  They like having McDonald's, and we choke on McDonald's.  Oh, the conspiracy theory going on here. 
[00:24:00]  Conspiracy.  Keep the fat people fat, right?  It's a false flag.  No, it is, Anthony, because it's like, what's better for him?  Get that fat pig fat, or we'll put him in a hospital bed and like train his savings or  whatever, or just like, let him eat healthy.  We'll be 107.  We don't need that.  Well, I think you could put the shitty food out there and the fat sneakers.  That's a very good point.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  We could work those 4,000 calories off of McDonald's.  Yeah.  But you managed to get through work with two different shoes on, so. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  That's always been my story, because like, I remember one of the first times my friend  was going to take me to meet his cousin on a date in high school.  And I was fat to begin with, so my belt broke.  Right.  And I had, like, acne, like Alfred E. Newman, all over my face when I was a kid in high school.  And I'm like, so we're walking to this girl's house, and all of a sudden, my friend introduced 
[00:25:00]  me, and I heard her go, walks in the next room, and she goes, you've got to be kidding  me with this.  Oh, no.  You heard her say that?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, what a fucking bitch.  Not good.  And then we went downstairs, and she's like, she's like, you know, and then she warmed  up a little bit, and I'm like, she's like, you know, maybe this isn't a good idea.  And I'm like thinking, you know what I love to guys now?  This is such a long time ago.  I love it, because I see all the women who never date me, who help me on Facebook, and  they're slowly turning into train wrecks. 
[00:25:30]  So it gives you solace.  Right, right.  With guys, they can look sophisticated when they get older.  Woman, there's no turning back.  Woman?  She just hit, they all hit the wall, and you fucking laugh.  I know, I love it.  I'm like, look at that horde.  It took years and years and years, but you're finally getting your comeuppance.  Yes, yes.  I love it, guys.  You know, I'm like.  Women aging are like this studio, I guess.  Uh-huh.  Right, they just fall apart.  They fall apart.  They get crackly. 
[00:26:00]  Their pieces start deteriorating.  Right.  And then you got some guy in the corner snoring instead of making sure the studio works.  Oh, God.  We've got to replay that audio.  It's true, because it's great to have social media.  You see what some of these whores look like.  These whores.  Are you going to get a special whore for Christmas, for the baby Jesus?  No, you know, I've got to be respectful on Christmas and just wait until New Year and,  you know, pop a bottle of champagne up and put some skank after that.  Some skank.  Hey, when you went downstairs to talk to this girl, after you heard her say, oh, well, 
[00:26:30]  you've got to be kidding me with this, why did you even talk to her?  I was just, you know, I was only a kid.  I was a little upset, and I was like thinking, you know, I was going to curse her out, but  I'm like, it's my friend's cousin.  I'm like, oh, God.  And then I just tried to, I've always tried to be a general woman, but sometimes.  Did you acknowledge it?  Did you say, hey, I heard what you said, or?  No, I did.  I just overlooked.  I should have.  Oh, God.  I should have looked at what I had.  Kids are such faggots when they get, like, fucking nailed like that.  You should just turn around and go, really, bitch? 
[00:27:00]  What's so fucking special about you?  Damn it.  That would have worked.  Yeah, that on first sight, I'm a piece of shit.  Fuck you.  I feel like saying, you know, she was about 14 years old, I was going to say, listen,  honey, in a few years you'll be sucking dick under the hull of the hull.  Wow, right there.  Or that.  Oh, that's a hell of a jump.  That's what rejection leads to, I see.  Yeah.  We like when you're fired up.  I know. 
[00:27:30]  You know why?  Because, you know, I'll put it this way.  I like people who are cool.  I don't care what anybody is.  If somebody's a jackass, they're a jackass.  It don't matter.  Yeah, you could probably kill that girl now, and so much time has gone by, no one will  know it's you.  Oh, no, not only the girl.  Make that connection.  She was in a neighborhood that was, like, you know, kind of like, you know, with a lot  of Joe Pesci types.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  So, I don't know.  But they're all gone now.  They're probably writing a book about different shit, but she's probably like, that would be  I'm curious to wonder what she looks like now, because she was a cute girl then, 
[00:28:00]  but, you know, nothing stays forever.  I mean, those, you know, she could look like a woken fucking rose.  Who knows?  Right.  Even a rose will wilt eventually.  Even a rose will wilt and turn into fucking dog shit.  Okay.  Well, not dog shit.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I like it in angry sometimes, guys.  Oh, God.  That's great.  I've been so picked up by jerk offs.  I love it.  What's your five favorite words, Mike Bacchetti?  Oh.  That's a good one.  From St.I.  I own curse words, or just words? 
[00:28:30]  Five words.  Jerk off.  That's a word slash activity.  Jerk off.  What do you call it?  Dickweed.  What do you call people, right?  What do you call it?  Asswipe.  And one more.  One more.  And cockhead.  You know what I like about Mike?  All except one of his top five favorite words are compound words.  Are more than just one word.  We're going to let him slide.  Dickhead.  We're going to let him slide.  Hyphenated.  That's right, Sam.  I wish I would have did better in school.  I was just like, sat at my desk, looked like Oscar Madison's, and teachers would pull 
[00:29:00]  me apart, pull me by the ear.  My teacher, like, grabbed me a hundred feet by my ear, that fucking twat.  Wow.  Why'd she do that?  She was like, look at that desk.  It's a mess.  It's all, like, no containers.  Like, there's six months old in there.  Why don't you throw out that?  I don't know.  Wait, he had a desk?  You don't have a desk for the whole time.  You sure this wasn't your job?  No.  I thought I was in school.  My secretary teacher would yell at me.  Yeah, she was screaming.  Yeah, like, but every period you had a different desk.  A different desk.  Uh-oh, what school did you go to? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, guys.  Nobody's eating crayons.  Mike, how long was the bus you rode to school?  The old one desk for the whole day, school.  No, no.  You were on the other side of the school.  Someone had messy papers.  Oh, yeah.  Guys, it was a full-size bus.  I promise you.  Automatic stairs come down from the bus.  A lot of construction paper and paste classes. 
[00:30:00]  No, no, no.  So, she didn't crayons or anything.  Is it weird to leave the house without a hockey helmet?  Oh, no.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, for my God.  No, no.  Oh, sure.  Well.  Nobody's sticking their heads in toilets all day.  No, no.  I promise you.  So, wait.  So, you had the same desk all day?  Yeah.  All throughout high school or just?  I was just grad school.  Okay.  So, like, maybe elementary school.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember elementary school, we did sit in one classroom  with one teacher.  Yes.  Up until probably 6th grade or 5th grade, somewhere around there. 
[00:30:30]  7th grade for me.  7th?  I think it was 6th.  6th for me.  6th for me.  It was 7th for us.  Yeah.  No, 6th grade, I was changing classes.  By 6th grade.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, but not a lot.  There were, like, I think, 4.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, 4 classes.  Yeah, dip.  But before the...  Oh, no, no.  I was in a regular class.  But before that, it was the desk.  You kept all milks in your desk?  Yeah.  I was like, I don't want to...  I left all stuff.  Did it stink?  Yeah, she was complaining.  She goes, somebody's desk smells like something really bad. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, God.  You had sticky desk?  No, but she humiliated me in front of the class.  She's like, let's look at his desk.  She's pulling out like...  That makes for a healthy adulthood.  Yeah, his milk allowed on the desk.  What is she supposed to do?  He's got fucking rotten milks in his desk.  Well, let's see if anything's missing.  I know.  You know, she used to, like...  She just grabbed me by the ear.  She goes, this is going to teach you a good lesson.  She just grabbed me.  She grabbed your ear?  Yeah.  Just ripped my ear.  She grabbed your ear?  Yeah.  You started...  Oh, wait a minute.  Did she grab both your ears and wash your face with a stinky sponge?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No. 
[00:31:30]  No, wait.  No, no.  I think so.  Wait.  Yeah, she did it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  You are a naughty, naughty boy.  Naughty, naughty.  Naughty, naughty.  My Catholic school was brutal.  I went there for a little while.  You went to Catholic school?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like the first grade and then high school a little bit.  The nuns?  Still throwing out your milks?  No, my handwriting was horrible.  To this day, it still itch.  Yeah.  So the nun in those days just took the rule and just smashed my knuckles.  I think they really do that.  Yeah.  Well, let's see your handwriting. 
[00:32:00]  There you go.  What could he write?  Right now.  Okay.  What do you want to write?  Write something if you want to see your child again.  Write.  All right.  Hold on.  I got it.  I got it.  Hopefully it's a suicide note.  Write the Opie and Anthony show.  Make it easy.  All right.  I hope...  Okay.  Oh, my God.  See how horrible this is.  Wow.  It's taken up almost the whole page.  That should be hung up on a refrigerator.  See, it looks like Charles Manson wrote it.  Oh, my God.  No, it looks like...  We just found our new t-shirt design.  Yeah, that is... 
[00:32:30]  That would rule on a t-shirt.  It's very childlike, I must say.  No, it is, but you want to see my script?  And the round little circle to dots the I instead of a dot?  I haven't read the script in a long time, guys, so...  You should write SiriusXM in cursive.  Ew, you make a circle dot the I?  Wow.  Cursive is code, so certain people can't read it.  Did you live in Colorado in 1996?  Can't read the script.  Oh.  Oh, what is that?  Oh, what are you...  You scribbled.  What is that?  What is that?  What's that?  No, I just...  Mike, that's a doodle.  No, guys, she was like... 
[00:33:00]  I wasn't writing properly.  She goes, come here.  I want to teach her to write.  I didn't say it, Marsh.  I was just commenting.  What?  That's some broad outside.  Oh.  I was trying to look at her ass.  You know.  You like that, Mike?  I love every...  There's a lot of hot women out there, guys.  I got to get one myself.  Yeah.  Mike, top five things you would shove in a girl's ass.  Oh.  I'd stick my meat in and grab those tits and then fuck that skank from the back for a  while.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Well, all right. 
[00:33:30]  That's number one.  That's great.  Maybe I'm trying to...  You stole that from a Hallmark cart, didn't you?  We're trying to keep a rice pudding slapping her in the ass and push it up.  You know what I mean?  Oh, nice.  We're trying to keep it a little family friendly, so be careful.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Let me see.  Top five things.  Well, after holidays, how about a couple of...  You know, take her outside, shove a snowball up a butt, make a good one.  Oh, all right.  That's good.  All right.  That's three.  How about some macadamia nuts?  She was eating nuts over here.  You know.  What?  I've got to ask macadamia first.  It's kind of expensive for that order. 
[00:34:00]  You know, it's like probably 10 bucks a thing.  Yeah.  Two more.  What else?  Let me...  Oh.  How about some Italian pepperoni?  It's always food with you.  Like that Italian pepperoni in your pants?  Oh, no, no.  Yeah.  Come on.  Hey.  Hey.  It's like a brazole with a sore on it.  Let me shout.  And a pomegranate.  A pomegranate.  How much should I shit those things out of a restaurant?  They used to call them a Chinese apple. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And an avocado.  Only superfoods.  Some blueberries.  Only things with cancer fighting.  I just want to see those things flying out of a horse ass.  A salmon.  That's good.  You want to have a girl's ass?  Look at this.  A pomegranate.  Oh, that's disgusting.  They call them Chinese apples is right.  Today they call them pomegranate.  That's terrible.  They are.  They're superfood.  Yeah.  They make juice out of them.  Hey.  Aw.  I like the top five game with Mike Puschetti.  Yeah.  I think it's pretty good. 
[00:35:00]  It's kind of fun.  Wow, Mike.  Mike, what's your top five seasons?  Oh, just four seasons.  Oh, good.  You got it.  You told us.  You told us.  You got it.  You got it.  Yeah.  What are the top five excuses you've given when bloody underpants have been found in  your pocket?  Oh, no.  I don't know where these came from.  That's a good one.  That's one.  They'll buy that.  They'll let you go home.  Yeah, that's a really good one.  I don't know where these came from.  What do you call it?  I start in the start chamber.  Oh, that's two.  Call my lawyer. 
[00:35:30]  Okay.  That's two.  Cover your own ass, yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  I was just kidding.  Don't worry about it.  Okay.  What do you call it?  You really don't have to.  I don't know what to say.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  Are your headphones fixed?  They don't say melt.  No, no, Sam.  They're still kind of mangled like me.  Wow.  You're exhausting.  No, what else?  I don't know.  Were you troublesome as a child?  No.  I was always a kid that got picked on, but I'll tell you one good thing, though.  When I went to school, all the tough guys, the real tough guys, always put idiots in 
[00:36:00]  their place for me.  What?  No, no.  If I got picked on by...  They looked after you.  Yeah, yeah.  You were so pathetic, they looked after you.  No, like, no, seriously.  They had to bully someone, but they didn't bully him.  Yeah, but when I got picked on, right, one time this guy that I went to school with  actually became, you know, he was a mob guy years later.  Oh, sure.  You know, I mean, he said, shut the fuck up, otherwise you're going to have a problem  with me.  Because he was picking on me.  I'm like, whoa. 
[00:36:30]  I always got protected by the big guys, or football guys.  It was all the other guys that broke my balls, you know?  Were you funny?  It's like radio.  No, I was very quiet and shy, actually.  I said, like, if they called me for a book report, I'd be hiding in the back, hoping  to go and call me up in front of people.  And then when you did get called up, did you ever have to do an oral report?  Oh, I hated those damn things.  Yeah?  I'm like, I was never good at them.  I was like, fuck, this whore's going to call me up.  No, I don't want to do this.  Yeah, right.  But becoming a comic and an actor brought me out of my shell.  I love it.  Why is everyone a whore in a skank with you? 
[00:37:00]  I know, right?  I got a lot of...  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Somebody has an Edmund Kemper-like relationship with mother, don't they?  No, no, but I mean...  Yeah, it was kind of embarrassing.  I was always shy like that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues right now. 
[00:37:30]  Hit, hit, now, now.  Yes, it is, and I am E-Rock, and I am guiding you through the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  And 2013 was the return of our good friend, Otto Peterson, from the comedy act, Otto and George.  I don't have been out for a while due to an illness, but he's back, he's healthy, he's on stage again, and he tells us his tale of his recovery.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Flew up to Canada, and I woke up in a hospital in New Jersey. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, man.  Are you kidding?  And you have no memory of...  I lost eight days up there.  I was on...  I had an inner ear ear infection, and I was taking pain pills.  I have an infunction in my ear.  I can't hear you.  Yeah.  I...  Right.  Fucking call me up.  That shit loves it.  Jesus.  Yeah.  But, um...  Wait, so you were...  I had these weird dreams when I was on that Michael Jackson...  I was combative at the airport, and they wouldn't let me into Canada.  They took me to the emergency room.  I don't remember any of this.  What did you say to that...  Wait, wait, wait.  Could I slow you down? 
[00:38:30]  You had an inner ear infection.  I flew with an inner ear infection.  Right.  I was taking illegal painkillers, and so I didn't realize how sick I was.  How about an illegal fucking penicillin?  Yeah, Trish tried to get me to go to the emergency room, and I just wanted to get to the gig and  go to sleep at the hotel, and I would have died if I went to sleep.  No shit!  Yeah, I had a blood...  It was in my blood, and I got bacterial meningitis, and then, uh...  So I was on that Michael Jackson, and knocked me out with that.  I have no memory.  Propofol.  Propofol.  How did you get this?  Do you know how you get it, or...? 
[00:39:00]  Well, that was my Achilles heel.  I used to get earaches during my childhood, like, a lot, but I hadn't had one in years.  But I thought...  When I woke up in Jersey, I thought I was shot in Canada.  I had this vivid dream of being shot in a club by some gangsters, like gangbanger-type  guys.  And I kept asking the doctors, was I shot?  And then when they x-rayed me at one point, I asked them if I had any bullets in me.  I still thought I was shot.  And then I said, did I miss the Frank Sinatra show?  And Trish goes, what are you talking about? 
[00:39:30]  I said, Frank Sinatra did a benefit to get me better, didn't he?  And she goes, he's been dead.  You know that, right?  I actually had a dream of Sinatra being at the club.  You were like Tony Soprano when he was fucking laying in the hospital.  The dreams were weird.  And I also dreamt that I was on this train.  I knew that I was laying down and I wasn't like sitting up.  I was aware of that, but I was on this train that was going somewhere.  And there were like these rodeo clowns were jumping off this train and they were being 
[00:40:00]  sprayed by a hose and like falling off the train and running across this field.  Very weird.  What weirdness?  How disappointing is it to think Sinatra did a benefit and then you wake up and realize  it was Levy.  That's great.  That's great.  It was fucked up.  So you don't remember eight days?  I don't remember anything in Canada at all.  They got a private plane for me to come back and all that.  What were you doing in the airport?  Did she say, like, how were you being combative? 
[00:40:30]  Like with the customs people?  Well, first I threw up in line at Newark.  I just suddenly ralphed and everybody scattered.  And then instead of like checking me out or something, they took me to the head of the line  so I can get through security.  Get him through fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just put me on the plane and I just became combative at customs.  I don't remember what I did or anything.  Just probably obnoxious.  So I thought they wouldn't let you into Canada.  No, they wouldn't let me just wander the streets. 
[00:41:00]  They red flagged me and took me to the emergency room.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I took like four guys to hold me down and they just put that propofol down my throat.  Holy shit.  I don't remember that part either.  Wow.  I was reeling with this earache.  I was, I don't know.  Yeah, you must have had like fucking poison blood, a fever.  I hadn't been inside of a hospital since I was like 13, so it was weird.  Right, right.  And then when I woke up, there was all these guys with masks and gowns.  I thought I was dying for sure.  Holy shit.  My sister was there.  My brother came in from Philadelphia. 
[00:41:30]  So you're like, yeah, they don't just show up.  My sister looked, the look on her face was like I had already died.  And I didn't want to go to sleep because I didn't think I was going to wake up.  Fuck.  And they were giving me all this Xanax and nothing would work.  I was up for, oh, and also I couldn't hear anybody.  It was like I was underwater, that kind of deafness.  Wow.  But that went away.  My hearing is actually better now.  Really?  Since the illness.  Yeah.  The only thing was I had like my legs were like jello when I, you know, because when  you don't move for eight days, your muscles turn to fucking guacamole. 
[00:42:00]  It's tough to atrophy.  It only takes eight days.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's unbelievable.  An Olympic athlete would have been the same.  You stand up and it's like a newborn giraffe.  You just hitch forward.  You know?  Wow.  So they had to watch me like step in and out of a tub.  Before they let me go home, they had to know that I could walk around the apartment  without like killing myself and stuff like that.  Isn't that ironic?  You had fucking legs like George.  Yeah.  Flopping around.  Cloth puppet legs would have been more useful. 
[00:42:30]  Fucked up though.  Cloth puppet legs.  Yeah.  How many days were you in the hospital, Otto?  What did they do?  No, how many days?  Damn.  I was in the Jersey Shore Hospital for about four or five days and then they moved me to  this rehabilitation place in Red Bank.  The guy in the bed next to me had turned a motorcycle over it.  It took down like 50 feet of a fence.  Every bone in his body was shattered. 
[00:43:00]  And they were giving him, sorry, they were giving him like the best drugs like Oxycontin  and all that because he had broken bones.  And I was, and Trish told everybody that I had a propensity for drug abuse or whatnot.  And I couldn't get anything.  Oh, man.  They were just giving me like Advil and the headache was unbearable.  Fuck that, give me morphine.  Unbearable.  Yeah.  The one time I actually needed painkillers, they wouldn't give them to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, it was pretty ugly.  Damn.  But like I said, I was never sick before and it was just, it just came out of nowhere. 
[00:43:30]  And they don't know exactly how you get that stuff.  It's a, didn't that like kill Jerry Red Wilson or was his the other meningitis?  Yeah, he got that in Hawaii.  Yeah, he was dead before he got back to LA, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a comic.  I don't know if you guys remember Jerry.  I know the name, yeah.  He was, he was, he was a rising and he got a meningitis and on the flight, I think they  said he shouldn't have flown.  Yeah.  And his girlfriend said he woke up during the flight and started making no sense and we were babbling  and then just, I guess, died.  He used to play at the Fast Eddie's a lot of me.  Yeah, he was a good guy.  No, they said one in four people die from what I had, but fuck it. 
[00:44:00]  I got lucky.  But I don't, I don't see like a new world.  Like I didn't gain that wisdom from a brush with death.  It's just, I feel like I'm, I'm going to go through this again and it'll fucking do me  in next time.  Like I live to die another day like that.  Right.  Like cynical about it.  Some people say that you're not scared to die after you go through something like that.  Well, if you see a white light, maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe get a hint of what's next.  That's for sure.  Hospitals suck.  They don't give a fuck about you there. 
[00:44:30]  They really don't.  It's their business.  It's their business.  You're just a number, man.  They're watching Saturday Night Live and you're screaming and putting a button.  They're watching a bad sketch on SNL.  Fuck up, man.  They don't give a fuck.  But you're, she's 100% right.  Yeah.  They don't give a fuck.  Wow.  They're just annoyed that you're screaming.  Yeah.  What about that weird moment though when you're walking by, when you, when you're walking and  the nurse said, Otto, have you been giving your medication to Jim?  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  It's wrong to want to be alone.  Yeah.  I'm not going to use Otto's head.  Yeah.  Florentine came and saw me a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I couldn't get rid of that guy.  He was here like three times.  Yeah.  I didn't know he liked me that much.  It was really nice of him.  That's cool.  Do you know who this man is?  This is Otto.  His men are coming here to kill him.  Jim just stood there with his hands shaking, trying to light a cigarette in the front.  After they threw his flowers out at fruit.  Yes.  Fucking atrocious food they give you.  The fucking can't taste anything.  The eggs sucked.  It's horrible, man. 
[00:45:30]  You must appreciate food more now.  You're at like better food that you have to eat that garbage.  Yeah.  Just appreciate, you know, you know, everything at home and not being, you know, fucking talking  to doctors, asked me the same.  They kept asking me questions like, do you know what state you're in?  Do you know who the president is?  They wanted to see how fucked up I was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Holy shit.  How long were you in rehab?  That was like seven days.  I got, the nurse was really cool.  She goes, you're the healthiest one here.  You're going to, I'm going to get you out of here quickly.  Because there were people that were just dying, like stroke victims and shit.  We recovered very well. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, I know that can be a fucking disastrous end result, but you recovered.  So the whole thing was about what?  Three weeks?  Yeah.  Probably, probably the better part of a month.  June was just a blur, you know?  And then when, when they did the benefit for me, I was like really healthy.  It felt fraudulent, you know?  Yeah.  I'm standing there with a tan, you know?  Yeah, God looks fine.  What the fuck is this about?  Yeah, they're looking for an oxygen tank or some shit.  It felt like, it felt fraudulent, but that's because the hospital bills didn't start coming  in yet, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, now it comes in definitely handy, you know? 
[00:46:30]  Jesus Christ.  All from a fucking ear infection?  Yeah.  I found out I had terminal cancer and to make the co-payments, I started selling crystal  meth to teenagers.  It's wacky.  Well, we're absolutely glad you're all right.  Oh, man.  Thank you for the cards and letters.  The worst is yet to come.  This is O&A's Worst of 2013.  This is 2013.  On the O.P. & Anthony channel. 
[00:47:00]  O.P. & Anthony's Worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  Continues right now.  Hello, I am E-Rock and this is the Worst of 2013 for the O.P. & Anthony show.  Now, every year in the month of October, we span the airwaves of North America to see what  is out there on terrestrial radio.  What are you people listening to if you're not listening to Sirius XM?  We call this Jocktober.  And one of the staples of Jocktober is looking at a morning show here in the number one market  in New York City in the United States of America. 
[00:47:30]  The show has been featured every year since we started Jocktober back in 2008.  This year alone, five appearances.  I present to you the best of the worst of Scott and Todd.  O&A's Worst of 2013.  All right, a little Jocktober, ladies and gentlemen.  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad. 
[00:48:00]  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-T.  Host.  Host.  Fits.  And stunt boys.  Isn't it funny?  It's time for...  Jocktober.  I got a tree on my house.  Oh, hey.  All right.  And remember, we said we want to change it up a little bit this year, make it a little  different.  Yeah.  We have decided that this particular show needs way more than one day. 
[00:48:30]  Of course.  Way more than one day.  Yes.  So for this year's Jocktober, Fridays are dedicated to Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd morning show.  Friday is Scott and Todd day.  I got a tree on my house.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd.  They've been a staple in New York City radio for many, many years.  I personally don't understand why, but for some reason, they have enough of an audience 
[00:49:00]  that they continue to fucking broadcast.  Amazing.  Just looking at their picture, they have WNBA coach faces.  Yeah.  Ladies, hustle it up.  Come on, girls.  Come on, girls.  Hustle it up.  Another layup.  Scott and Todd.  Scott Shannon should be a reminder that you should not...  What happened there?  Oh.  Is it possible?  What happened to the Facebook page?  What a fucking drag.  Pre-empt?  Uh-oh.  Pre-emptive.  It's possible.  Let me...  What did they know? 
[00:49:30]  We got a pre-emptive strike here?  I bet E-Rock tipped them off.  He's working for Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  He's like, hey, by the way, fuck them guys.  They're going to fuck you today.  It is all the dirt.  Shut down your Facebook.  I think we kind of...  I think we talked about Fridays being Scott and Todd day before today, so I think they're  on to us.  No, here you go.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Hey, there we go.  Scott and Todd from PLJ.  PLJ.  PLJ here in New York City.  PLJ's Facebook page?  Scott Shannon, in all fairness, did a lot of cool things for radio, but he probably should 
[00:50:00]  have stepped out a few years ago.  Oh, boy.  He's overstayed his welcome.  Yeah.  It's a reminder that maybe there's a time for all of us to just step aside.  Is it that he's just trying too hard now, or...?  No, he's not trying at all.  Yeah, at all.  He has a rock mouth.  That's fair enough.  Meow.  He looks like a fucking rock, and he sounds like one.  He's saying he's a rock-headed idiot?  He's a rock-headed idiot.  He has Easter Island head.  Those fucking monoliths.  And I don't know, it looks like he's had some work done over the years to the point he 
[00:50:30]  might have fucked up his own...  He went to the well too many times?  I think so, yes.  Most of his face doesn't move.  There's nothing better than a guy with too much facial plastic surgery.  Oh, yeah.  And he really doesn't say much on the radio anymore of importance.  Oh, man.  No.  He looks like...  Like his partner, Frost's hair.  Pumped out of stuff.  A lot.  Yeah.  He looks like a senator that tried to kill Steven Seagal, or set up Steven Seagal.  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[00:51:00]  He's just like, I know you're a good cop, but I don't care.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, he could have a rolling machete.  Yeah.  What do we got from Scott and Todd?  You got Todd.  Mm-hmm.  The one that likes a good frosting.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's telling a DMV story.  Boy, that's topical.  Okay.  People can relate.  Very relatable.  He puts Scott...  I like how Sam wrote this out.  And his comments on the pay-no-mind list. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, but no.  He won't let him talk.  Fuck no.  He knows.  And never feeds him anything to get his opinion and tries to shut him down.  Wait till you...  Scott jumps in a couple times.  Oh, God.  And Todd places him directly on the pay-no-mind list.  Directly?  I love it.  Not subtle at all, huh?  No.  I mean, a one-way ticket to the pay-no-mind list.  You know, sometimes when we do Jacktober, I see the track list, and I go, oh, fuck, we 
[00:52:00]  gotta do four more.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm feeling sad here that we don't have, like, twice as many clips today.  That's why we celebrate every Friday.  I love it.  I am so sad.  This relationship between Todd and Scott really is just making me...  This is great.  It's magic.  It's like a son who hates his father, but his father won't die.  He's just like, yeah, Dad, we know it, okay?  Right.  You're embarrassing me.  They've been together forever, because my friend, and he is my friend, in the end, Jim  Chandler. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, but he rocks your friend, too.  Oh, boy.  Look what you did to him.  Jim Chandler...  Friends like him, who needs enemies, right?  Oh, yeah!  Chip off.  Get him, Chip.  Got Chip all around.  Jim Chandler worked with Todd up in Albany at The Fly, and they were doing very well together.  And Todd decided to take the big gig in New York with Scott.  Yeah, because that frosting ain't going to pay for itself.  No.  That's right.  You've got to get that frost money.  I wish we could fucking put, like, little frost pellets in a shotgun. 
[00:53:00]  Can we use that?  It's a new applicator.  Yeah.  You frost it from the inside of the throat.  Fucking die.  Fuck, yeah.  It makes me very happy that Todd is now stuck with this rock.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's hear...  I got to hear this.  I love it.  Well, I'm slowing down, because, like, I finally...  You don't want to have a good meal?  You don't want to fucking...  Yes!  I found out what it is.  I found out Scott and Todd's relationship is Todd is the gold-digging wife that married  the old rich man, and now the old rich man won't die. 
[00:53:30]  It's Anna Nicole and her old husband.  Not dying.  Give me a kiss.  Kiss me on the lips.  And turn that off.  I hate One Direction.  I don't like it.  Yeah, goddamn kids.  Well, that episode of Twilight Zone with the old guy and his fucking niece.  Barbara, Barbara, bring me some hot cocoa in my bone cup, Barbara.  Scott and his comments are put on the Pay No Mind list.  I had quite a day yesterday.  Really?  Yeah.  I had to go to DMV.  Oh, no. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, no.  And the lady who usually helped me over there retired.  So guess what?  It's on my own.  You had to go in there like a regular New Jerseyan.  I don't know.  The people I saw in there, I never saw in New Jersey.  I felt like somebody should have been playing a steel drum offering me a little plastic cup of punch.  So basically, you were riding in steerage.  How long was your day there?  Oh, wow.  What does that mean?  About an hour 45.  Nothing. 
[00:54:30]  Riding in steerage?  Steering?  Is that a plane?  They hate minorities.  Oh, they certainly do.  You can tell from their brakes.  Yeah, you know, what happened?  They fired a jigger bull who used to help you?  All right, keep it in steerage.  I probably put her out in the field.  What happened to the woman that used to help you?  She was a nice lady.  She used to make fun of Scott's voice, but what about Todd's voice in that cadence?  What's he doing?  Todd continues to ignore Scott's additions to his story. 
[00:55:00]  So we got more of the DMV story here.  Oh, good.  Thank God.  They took my picture, and then she goes, stand back by the wall and wait till it prints.  That's exactly how they talk to you.  I'm like this.  You got it, Dave.  Whatever you want.  Or else.  The next guy steps up.  She goes, well, where'd you come from?  Off the street before this?  And he went like this.  Yes.  She don't even bat an eye.  She's like, all right, well, fine.  That explains why I have no one dressed before this.  I think what happens, Todd, is they become hardened over the years with the people they deal with. 
[00:55:30]  A.C. was down in there yesterday, too.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's about 112.  Wow.  That says a lot.  He just swatted them out of there.  It's like he never spoke.  He's done with them.  He's done with them.  Todd stinks, too, though.  His voice is fucking terrible.  He's trying to put on some kind of fucking Brooklyn thing.  It's almost like he's doing shitty New York sports talk radio. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  I'll tell you this.  Eli Manning is not.  No, it's the cadence, though.  Because they got to know what she was trying to do.  It's what they are.  She told me what about it.  I'm trying to be horrible.  Who listens to this shit?  This dreck.  I'm imagining that Todd didn't even look at him as he spoke.  No, no.  He just was looking at someone else.  And Scott's trying to get in there.  Hey, I think what you were trying to do.  Yeah, you know who else was down there?  Am I a ghost?  Did I die?  I say we're down in there. 
[00:56:30]  Fuck.  That's got to be brutal.  Hideous.  What's the matter, Spidey?  You put me on a pay no mind list?  You fucking stutter and mutter and prick you?  Dance it over.  Dance it over here, you fucking Todd.  Get fucked.  Dad's the joke.  He's a hack.  His whole family's hacks.  He'd have grown up to be a hack.  Scott talks about what movie he wants to see this weekend.  Yeah, this is a good one.  What do you mean it's good?  That sounds like just a normal thing to say on the radio.  Yep. 
[00:57:00]  I got to tell you what.  I'm going this weekend.  Gravity?  Nope.  Runner Runner?  Nope.  What?  What?  I want to see the boat movie.  No, it's next week.  That's not this week, no.  Confused.  Grandpa.  The boat movie.  What's the boat movie?  Is that the Tom Hanks one?  I just got no comedy.  I'm a star.  I want comedy.  I want to see the boat movie.  Boat movie.  Sounds like a fucking retarded child saying, I want to see the boat movie.  The boat movie. 
[00:57:30]  Ah, it's the boat movie.  Where's the boat movie?  With the skinnies.  Where's the one where Tom Hanks kills the Africans?  Where's the boat movie?  Not a boat movie.  Is that the one where he got the soccer ball and he calls him Leon or something?  Chases him around the desert.  I'm on a boat.  The boat movie.  The boat movie.  Grandpa, there is no boat movie.  There's a boat movie.  The boat movie.  I hate movies.  That's not one where the Gilbert Grape kid falls in love with a girl and the boat goes 
[00:58:00]  down.  It's a boat movie.  Falls in love with a nice lady.  Wow.  Timothy Hutton's hanging on the back of the thing and crying at Judd Hirsch.  That's the boat movie.  His brother fell over the boat.  And Buck couldn't hold on for you.  You're stronger than Buck.  I want to see the boat movie.  That's the one where you have to go to.  It's the sequel to the bus movie.  The boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie where they fight the shark. 
[00:58:30]  They'd have been a boat.  The boat movie where they die to wear no life jacket.  The shark eats them.  The boat.  They'd have been a boat movie.  Sounds like I have Quint in my mouth.  I've got a fucking boat movie.  Yeah, well, we are DiCaprio falls in love with a girl.  She throws the hat in the water.  The boat movie.  The hat in the water.  Oh, see that one.  They really are guessing like he's completely C-9.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to start over because I really want you to appreciate this clip because there's 
[00:59:00]  such a confidence in his voice.  That's the one where James Bond takes on the water boat.  He's still on the water boat and goes somewhere and takes a something.  Yeah, where a kid and a lion go for a boat ride.  Yeah.  E-Rock went to that movie.  Don't do something totally different.  He doesn't even know what he's talking about.  He's just guessing.  The boat moment.  That sounded like a dottering old fool man. 
[00:59:30]  But the confidence.  Oh, yeah.  And he has everyone's attention.  And they're all playing along.  Is it?  Is it?  Yeah.  Is it?  He's feeling pretty good.  Like, they're finally paying attention to me.  And then he gets that fucked up.  I'm just queer with his frosted tips.  Not looking at me.  Look at me now.  Don't you, son?  A boat moment.  The boat moment.  Shutting out this weekend.  Ah, here we go.  One, right?  The boat turned upside down and the fat woman drowned. 
[01:00:00]  And Christopher Lee was living in it in part two.  A boat moment.  No, it's next week, Grandpa.  It's not even coming out this weekend.  I know.  I know.  That's the beauty of it.  We're starting over because the confidence is awesome.  Everyone's playing along.  He's got everyone's attention.  I'm going over it.  And then, boom.  No payoff again.  I got to tell you what.  I'm going this weekend.  Gravity?  Nope.  Runner Runner?  Nope.  What?  What?  I want to see the boat movie. 
[01:00:30]  No, it's next week.  It's not this week.  No.  Not yet.  It's the 11th.  They were doing all the reviews in the paper.  Yeah.  Well, because it premiered at the New York Film Festival.  It's called Captain Phillips.  Yeah.  Don't look for a movie called The Boat Movie.  You're just openly mocking him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't look for a movie called The Boat Movie.  Now, last year, we got a great fucking clip.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I think we got one already.  We got a new one.  He's The Boat Movie.  I wrote The Boat Movie.  I want to say The Boat Movie.  I want to say The Boat Movie. 
[01:01:00]  I like their reaction.  Their reaction is basically, shut up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up, you old fool.  And meanwhile, they stink, too.  Yes, they do.  I think I've turned the corner.  I think Todd is worse, because his voice is such a fucking put-on, shit-hack radio voice.  Yeah.  I can't even get...  Scott's at least just fucking old and finished.  But I think he's...  I think he did it for survival, though, in a weird way.  You think it's like...  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Like one of those victims of abuse, like, just started having an English accent? 
[01:01:30]  Well, yeah.  Humphrey Bogart.  We'll see The Boat Movie.  With the punch.  The Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  I think it works on LQ.  It's about some fruit.  The African Queen.  The Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  Yes, that's a Boat Movie.  Boat Movie.  It's just him mumbling into his soup.  That's great.  You ever see the other one?  There's like a lot of Boat Movie.  Where was that one?  It just blew them up.  Not the Space Movie. 
[01:02:00]  The Boat Movie.  No, there's a lot of Hawaiians in it, and they blew up a bunch of boats.  It was the Blow Up the Boats Movie.  The Boats down there is my favorite book.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  We got a clip.  That's a clip.  We got a clip.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  I feel like that's like...  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Like he's in his wheelchair at the ticket office?  Yeah, yeah.  At the movie theater?  How many tickets, sir?  The Boat Movie.  What is that?  The Boat Movie. 
[01:02:30]  We don't have something called the Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  He starts ringing the bell.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  It's perfect, though.  It's clean.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Get that on our machine immediately.  It's clean.  He's like Tugo's uncle.  He just keeps sitting.  Hit the bell.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  The Boat Movie.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Ding, ding.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Oh, he's doddering.  Oh, that's great.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Yeah, I want to see the Boat Movie.  You know. 
[01:03:00]  What movie is that?  The Boat Movie.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  It's like he's just sitting there.  That is this year's I Got a Tree on my house.  It's like you got to deal with an older relative and you're finally like, what?  Yeah.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Just keeps slamming his wheelchair into your head.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Morty wants to see the Boat Movie.  Lee, Lee, after you're done with the Swiffer, let's go see the Boat Movie.  Your father won't stop talking about the Boat Movie. 
[01:03:30]  The Boat Movie.  We're not going to go to the movies.  It's Thursday.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Oh, you always want to see the Boat Movies.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Okay, but you just need to take your pills first.  Yeah, don't worry.  Just take your medication and we'll show you the movie.  You mean Captain Phillips?  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Boat Movie.  That's what I say. 
[01:04:00]  I want to see the Boat Movie.  I want to describe it as the Boat Movie.  A dummy.  An old dummy.  I want to see the Boat Movie.  Then Todd comes back in his normal voice.  Hey, everybody.  Just a little...  Scott fell asleep in the studio.  Yeah.  He's worse to me.  It's phone scam time.  Chew my back out.  Who are you?  Huh?  Who are you?  Paranormal.  Paranormal? 
[01:04:30]  Okay.  Should we...  Should we never say, who are you?  Of course.  Can we point out all the stuff that doesn't happen with a regular phone call?  Yeah, you don't call a doctor.  When you throw a fake name out there, most people are onto that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's so fake.  Once again, for the people, we're blowing up a lot of radio shows and their spots, but  you can't do prank calls on the radio anymore.  So if you hear a prank call out there, it's all set up in advance. 
[01:05:00]  The FCC changed the rules.  There was a time you were allowed, and we had a lot of fun with it ourselves.  But you cannot do it.  It's a major FCC fine.  This is Heywood.  Hey, would you blow me?  All right, what do we got so far?  Prank calls are illegal to air.  Right.  Nobody thinks Paranormal is a real name.  Things that make this phone call fake.  Should I add in everybody knows the Jerky Boys voice by now?  Oh.  No, we'll give you the benefit of a doubt on that. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, we'll pass it up for now.  Paranormal?  Okay.  I need to see a physician right away.  My back's all frigged up.  All right, would you like to come in at 2.30?  That's the soonest I can make an appointment for you.  2.30, I'll be dead.  Well, I don't think you'll be dead.  Well, how do you...  You don't know how much it hurts.  I know it must hurt.  Oh, it hurts.  Mm-hmm.  My back, I feel like it's been ripped in half.  Like something out of Beetlejuice. 
[01:06:00]  What was that?  The lady hung up because of his outrageous comments.  Yeah.  His back is ripped up like Beetlejuice.  He's trying to do this.  But where's the hang-up part?  It's a horrible Jerky Boys impression.  Horrendous edit there.  Is anything real about this guy?  No, no.  His fucking fake calls, his fake voice.  Just talk like you, for fuck's sake.  That's all we ask from the radio guy or gal.  Yeah, just be yourself. 
[01:06:30]  And he edits her reaction really tight so he can jump right on top of it.  Right.  Of course.  He rocks in there talking.  Ripped in half.  Like something out of Beetlejuice.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  Can I help you?  My back is killing me.  What's the matter with you?  Where does it hurt?  By my coolie.  By what?  My coolie.  You bent over?  You did something?  You lifted something?  A fork truck ran into me.  Oh, you were hit by a truck?  Pause for a second. 
[01:07:00]  That sounds like the other guy from the Jerky Boys fucking prank.  It's the dentist.  My teeth, right?  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  The lawyer.  Oh.  No, no.  The one where it's like, sue me.  Yeah.  Sue me?  Why are you going to sue me?  What did I do?  Right.  Punitive damages here.  What the hell did I do?  It's the same fucking voice.  Wow.  Yeah, it is.  So what do you think is going on?  I don't know.  I think it's the guy.  If it's not the guy, it's a guy doing an impression of that guy.  Like he knows this guy. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, I see.  In the studio, I'll call you.  Sound like that guy.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  My Cooley.  By what?  My Cooley.  You bent over?  You did something?  You lifted something?  A fork truck ran into me.  Oh, you were hit by a truck?  Yes.  I'm trying to eat chicken soup and things of that sort.  That's not going to do anything for you.  I got your name from the yellow pages on my Ouija board, and I very much run my life  by the Ouija.  I am.  Listen.  That one's like fucking trying to laugh it along. 
[01:08:00]  Literally, it's the unfunniest fucking phone call.  Nothing funny there.  This is so bad.  And it's stolen conceptually.  Right.  It's trying to steal.  It's fucking stolen conceptually from the jerky boys completely.  Not all prank calls are stolen from the jerky boys, but that one.  Trying to be obscure.  I'm eating, trying to eat soup and things of that sort.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a sol fucking vibe.  My shoes fell off.  Right.  That's a sol.  It's fucking thievery.  Total thievery. 
[01:08:30]  Cocksuckers.  This is why Jocktober is great.  They're terrible.  Expose them.  Expose them.  That's the shit that radio puts on.  Yeah.  Bah, bah, bah.  Cocksuckers.  Hey, Tucker.  Who are you calling there, Todd?  Who's on the telephone?  They are hideous.  Sound like, uh, what is that?  I want to see the Jake Boy movie.  The Jake Boys.  What's that?  Yeah, the Jake Boys. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, look at the fucking picture.  Look at the teeth on that motherfucker.  You know, they can't be real.  We're at a phone prank.  Look at how we moved out.  Yeah.  The one next to him.  Scott is.  The one next to him with his big, giant, dumb teeth.  Scott's picture on the website looks like those promo shots from toddlers in Tiaras.  They're all fucking, they look like paintings.  And that's how your teeth are going to look.  No.  Careful.  True.  No.  Blonde, frosted hair looking.  Paying a lot of money.  Fucking big, dumb teeth.  Look at the fucking choppers on Peggy.  They are very fake. 
[01:09:30]  People are just mad today.  Their phones.  Dude, it's fucking.  Everyone's like, I think I'm turning it off today.  It's so mad I'm about to turn off your radio.  Nice.  Bah.  Well, let's get back to the phone scan.  Please.  It's not over.  See what happens.  You need, you need.  I need a new Ouija board.  You need a what?  A new Ouija board.  No, no, what did the, the, uh, the doctor say?  Oh, you need to have a funny bone implanted.  Oh. 
[01:10:00]  You need, you need.  I need a new Ouija board.  I like how the dialing starts right after you.  Buttons, buttons.  Hello?  Thank God.  What's the matter?  My back.  Who is this?  It's all frigged up.  Oh, who's this?  Peridingle.  Peridingle?  Yes.  Oh.  Oof.  Can you pause this for a second, please, before I throw coffee on myself?  Stop trying to set up the unfunny fake names, you fucking big toothed, beaver face fucking lump. 
[01:10:30]  You've had it.  Every single fucking call.  Who's this?  Who's this?  What's your funny name?  They fucking stink.  And he comes up with the worst funny names ever, too, by the way.  They're terrible.  Go with the tried and true if you're going down that road.  Holy shit.  It's not funny, funny names.  Ha ha ha. 
[01:11:00]  Click.  Button, button, button, button, button.  Hello?  What's your name?  What?  Oh, my fucking God.  Button, button, button, button.  I can't make it up.  Are you right in front of this building?  Yeah, right down, passed out.  Oh, really?  And nobody's coming to your rescue over there?  It's New York.  They could care less.  Okay.  That is the unfunny, literally, the unfunniest fucking prank call I've ever heard in my life.  This is absolutely unfunny. 
[01:11:30]  Look, nothing funny there.  Look, just because someone plays along doesn't mean it's funny enough for the radio.  Right, right, right.  Remember the old days?  We would, because we got to play a lot of music, we would do our prank calls, and you  would get people to play along, and you would have to cut your losses and go, all right,  the jokes weren't there.  Didn't work.  Fuck, let's try it again.  Yeah.  And you would do about ten of them, and maybe one was good.  Yep.  This guy, if someone plays along, oh, we've got to get it on the radio immediately.  Peridingle.  His improv is terrible.  Yeah.  I got a thing happening. 
[01:12:00]  My good one.  And then he's just doing salt.  Jerky boy.  It's fucking absolute conceptual theme.  That fucking picture on the website, his teeth, you can fucking read by his teeth.  Those giant fucking airbrush teeth.  Banks, it's a pain on the tooth.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I want you to put me on the website.  The tooth movie.  I want you to paint my teeth really light.  Can you paint them light?  Wait, which one is that again?  I got to hurt my back, because I'm lifting material. 
[01:12:30]  It's lifting material.  I'll get it.  Stealing.  I get it.  How about one real thing?  How about you talk in your real voice?  How about you do a real prank call?  How about you fucking do a call that is not conceptually stolen from guys who really were  prank called geniuses?  Oh, yeah.  The jerky boys were geniuses.  Yep.  That was fucking brilliant.  And he's ripping off everything.  The voice.  He's everything that's wrong with comedy.  He's just a cocksucker.  Yes.  Stealing it.  Just steal the fucking concept of it. 
[01:13:00]  Man, make the funny voice.  Oh, he's terrible.  What's your name?  I'm Mr. Whackadoodle.  What fucking adult laughs at that shit?  I'm laughing at you doing that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I don't want people to be confused.  You know, they're just picking like funny sounding names.  What's your name?  My name?  Mr.  Mr. Cocky Doody.  Yeah, Mr. Poop on my shoes.  Who? 
[01:13:30]  Click button, button, button.  Yeah.  Click.  Boom.  Button, button, button.  Dial, dial, dial.  Hello?  Who's this?  Mr. Wooka Jooka Jooka.  Bye.  Oh, chum-a-dee-doe.  Oh, chum-a-dee-doe.  What do you got the formula down, Jimmy?  Otter shit.  You throw just a lot of noise at the listeners.  They might think something's in there.  Some wild happens.  Right?  Just throw a lot of shit out there. 
[01:14:00]  That fucking non-improving goose egg.  Part to improv when your fucking teeth are nailed into your face.  Oh, fuck.  So what's the Do-Gooders concert?  Well, they did a big concert in the city, I guess.  And the only way you could get in is if you got points from a website for doing good deeds.  That's stupid.  That sounds nice.  You ran a marathon for breast cancer.  Boom!  Recycled all your cans, or I don't know.  Oh, that's nice phrasing, Sam.  That's funny. 
[01:14:30]  That was accidental, but I like it.  Oh, it's terrible.  That's dumb.  How do they keep track?  It's like a paid-forward thing?  Yeah.  All these people are paying it forward, so let's now get a band together?  Yeah.  Who was part of this concert?  A lot of people.  Alicia Keys.  Oh, that overrated fucking...  Alicia Keys is very good.  What?  Very good.  I don't remember now.  I think they mentioned it a couple of days.  Was that with John Mayer?  Yeah, John Mayer.  And Stevie Wonder?  I saw it.  Yeah, I just saw it after that yesterday.  It was a pretty big concert. 
[01:15:00]  Doesn't sound it.  No, Alicia Keys, John Mayer, and Stevie Wonder are fairly...  Who else was in that?  Fairly big ass.  David DeGrasse.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Well, I guess they're talking about the Do-Gooders concert.  And Scott is a senile, old man.  Oh, no.  See, Todd, you had to go on the website and amass points by completing an array of awareness-building  tasks.  Couldn't you just show up?  You had to do something.  I'm too busy doing good.  Not much I knew.  I'm too busy doing good.  I don't have time to go to the website.  Well, no, but if you're doing good, you can... 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, but I didn't know.  You got to prove it.  You got to know.  It was like Alicia Keys, Elvis Costello.  Pretty big event.  But you had to be...  You got to prove that you did something good.  Do-Gooder.  Yeah, well, you had to do it through the website.  You can't just walk up there and say, here's what I did.  Well, what if I had been driving a Tesla?  No, it's...  You have to get points.  It's through this organization. 
[01:16:00]  What about...  What's your car have to do with it?  What car are you driving?  Because it's like a battery car.  Okay.  Okay, we got one.  That's a battery car.  That's it.  Because it's like a battery car.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Because it's like a battery car.  What is he talking about?  Why did he even bring up the battery car?  Why is he talking about a Tesla car?  I'm going to take my battery car to the boat movie because there's a tree on my house. 
[01:16:30]  I don't know.  I actually know the answer to why you're talking about it.  Why?  He's a dumb cuss.  Okay, that makes more sense.  What does that mean?  It's a do-gooders concert, so what?  So he drove a Tesla.  You sign up and prove you did something for charity, whatever?  Yeah, whatever it is.  So what does the Tesla car have to do with it?  He's saying, what if I'm doing something good, like for the environment or whatever,  by driving a fucking economic-  That's such a stretch.  Environmentally-  That's such a stretch.  Yeah, I don't disagree.  It's one of the battery cars, you see. 
[01:17:00]  Battery car.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  You're going to try to re-listen and figure out if we missed something?  You have to get points.  It's through this organization.  What if-  What about-  What's your car have to do with it?  What car are you driving?  Because it's like a battery car.  God, it's like a battery car.  All right, when you isolate it, you don't need the because.  No, no.  That's why I wanted to hear that.  Yeah.  It's like a battery car.  That's all you need.  It's like a battery car.  But you need the-  It's like a battery car.  Yeah.  That's the part we need. 
[01:17:30]  Obviously.  I love it.  Yeah.  You have to get points.  Right.  It's through this organization.  What if-  What about-  What's your car have to do with it?  Because-  What car are you driving?  Because it's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  There it is.  It's like a battery car.  Oh, you got it right.  Perfect.  Nice.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Battery-  Every car has a battery car. 
[01:18:00]  Dude.  Battery car.  Like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Like a battery car.  Battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Plug that cocksucker in.  What?  The battery?  He sounds like a retarded child talking about stuff.  It's unbelievable.  Tree on his house.  The boat moving.  It's like a battery car.  Like a battery car. 
[01:18:30]  Bonus track time.  And on this one, I got to give the assist to Eric.  He is the Scott and Todd historian.  That kid's talented.  And people don't realize this.

And absolutely fucking cornball.  I kind of like how he lets people down easy by saying it laughing.  Yeah, yeah.  There wasn't one funny moment.  Oh, you've been phone scammed.  Ah, you've been phone scammed.  Hey, this is Joe. 
[01:23:00]  This is Joe Boots at Total Doodle.  I got a car and it's got a bunch of hats on it.  Why do they have hats on it?  I don't know.  It's crazy.  I think because I was drunk driving and I killed someone.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that Bob.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?

He received a bare-bottom spanking.  He was denied the affections of O.P. on countless occasions and arguing with staff members.  And by staff members, it's usually Travis.  ONA's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  This is so disgusting.  And you have waxing?  And so gay.  Be generous with the waxing.  Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax. 
[01:24:30]  What the fuck is going on right now?  Oh, boy.  What's going on back there?  Oh, this is not good.  What's going on back there?  This is not good.  No need to clench up.  Troy, what is he going through?  Wait, wait.  What's going on?  He's a hairy mess.  He's way open.  Everything is open.  Okay, relax.  Relax.  Relax, baby boy.  Hold him apart.  If you're not relaxed, it's going to be painful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have to clench up.  Oh, boy.  No daddy seed to milk.  Oh, boy.  This one's going to hurt.  Oh, no.  This one's good. 
[01:25:00]  Sarah, you've got to let her get it off.  Stop clenching.  You're fucking it up.  You're making an order.  Relax.  Okay.  Relax.  This is literally ripping his asshole hair out.  Oh, God.  Right out.  Come on, buddy.  Dude, this is...  Be a trooper.  Come on, buddy.  What's that?  It's not a sound he usually makes.  Oh, my God.  That was the worst one. 
[01:25:30]  Is your ass bleeding?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Okay.  Hold on over, please.  Turn over.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Listen to that large penis.  He's laughing at him.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Yeah, my dick is fucking all shriveled up because of my little fuck guy.  Oh, yeah.  Look at his little dick.  Get your hands out. 
[01:26:00]  That dick's pathetic.  Come on, man.  Oh, Nicole's in E-Rock's studio.  Nicole, what do you think?  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Do you like Sal's studio?  I don't want to embarrass him.  Oh, God.  I don't want to stand here.  She's so it.  I gotta go.  Yeah.  Legs are in the air now.  Oh, God.  How does it feel?  This is what we go through.  How does it feel?  Hold your legs open, Sal.  Come on.  We've got some business to conduct here. 
[01:26:30]  No.  Oh, jeez.  He's on his back now, holding his legs straight in the air.  That's right.  Oh, Troy Kwan helping out.  Yeah, look at that.  What a hairy mess he is.  Conduct some business.  He's in the giving birth position.  Let's relax.  Throw up.  We need stirrups.  It's situations like this where I realize I am so not gay.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:27:00]  What happened to your dick, dude?  That's terrible.  It's awful.  Horrible.  How am I supposed to relax, Sam?  That is the gayest fucking thing.  It's got gayer than yesterday.  It's so.  This really is.  This is the gayest live scene I've ever been in.  Like, I've never been this close to actual gay going on like this.  It is terrible. 
[01:27:30]  This is probably gayer than what's going to happen next Wednesday.  Yes.  Yes.  But I'm flinching at the.  I've got to be careful.  What's going on over there, Troy?  His legs up in there.  His ball bag's hanging out.  Loud gasser.  Here we go.  What is she going for?  She's going near the hole.  Ow!  You know, why couldn't we just have a girl come in, get naked and do this?  It's funnier.  Yeah, it's funnier.  Yeah, but it would be so hot.  I know, but me to see big, fat pussy lips, I would just be ruining everything by going  Oh, yum. 
[01:28:00]  It's warm and it's fun.  I'm not even going to say it.  It's what?  You know.  What?  It was like a load in there?  Go ahead.  It was good.  Mark it.  It was warm and it was going into my ass.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Don't flinch.  What a fuck.  What a fuck's.  Oh, my God.  You fucking punk.  What the fuck has my life come to?  Just fire a log out.  Just do it. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, God.  That's not good.  Push really hard.  Yeah.  Fire one out.  Fire a log out.  Fire a log out.  At least a nice gasser.  I love the word fire a log out.  If you shit on that table, I'll fucking, I'll never stop loving you.  She shit on the table.  She is really.  Oh, yeah.  She's taking this very seriously.  She is.  Very clinical.  Correct.  She's very clinical.  She doesn't realize we don't give a shit.  Thank God.  How good of a job she does.  Really?  Ugh, God.  Ew.  Look at him.  Ew.  You can't see it from your vantage point. 
[01:29:00]  The taint is very hairy.  Is it?  Yeah.  Very hairy taint.  Do you want to come over and get a look?  Keep your goddamn fucking legs up.  Head down?  Head down.  Look at that.  Relax.  Okay.  Head down, ass up.  Would it be better if you got the doggy style position?  Sam, should we do some live reads during this?  What the hell?  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  What part is...  Oh, it's very hot.  What's...  Oh, it's very hot.  It's the taint.  What, it's hot?  I want you to keep the head down.  Keep your head down and relax. 
[01:29:30]  It's the taint in the bottom of the ball bag.  Oh, nice.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Here it comes.  You're not even going to feel it.  Uh-oh.  I'm not going to feel...  Shut the fuck up, Sam.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hold on.  Get a good one.  Hold on.  You got this.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking just nail it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Fire a log in.  Nope.  Oh, my God.  Just turtle.

[01:30:00]  Hold your bag.  Yeah.  Wow.  Nothing.  Nothing's loosened up either.  He's just...  Ugh.  Oh, she's ripping hair right off.  Here.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  Don't scream, please.  You're good.  Whenever there's a countdown, it's going to hurt a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  God, what a chimp.  That's the...  Oh, my God.  He's stuck it on Travis's head.  Are you fucking kidding me?  He's stuck it on Travis's head. 
[01:30:30]  I'm holding the fucking mic, you asshole.  Oh, my God.  He's stuck it on Travis's head.  You're shitting me, right?  Travis is not happy.  Travis is not happy.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You're fucking shitting me, right?  Out of everyone in this fucking room.  Out of everyone in this fucking room.  Oh, my God.  You put it on my fucking head.  I'm sorry.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Oh, my God.  I'm waxing, dude.  I'm sorry, Travis.  You're fucking kidding me, right?  It's on my head?  No, it's off now.  I took it off.  Yeah, it's just mostly...  You fucking asshole.  You lost the only person who would defend you here. 
[01:31:00]  Oh!  Nice.  That's got to be embarrassing with your penis hanging out.  You just got scalded while a former communist is holding your dick.  Oh, fuck it.  While Draco is waxing it.  Denny gets annoyed at Sal, too, though.  Because Sal, like...  He fights much more off the air for some reason than he does on the air.  It never made any sense to me.  But he talks all kinds of shit off the air. 
[01:31:30]  And he'll get Denny all pissed off.  And Denny doesn't like...  Because Sal doesn't respect Denny.  No.  And Sal's, like you guys know, he's a newbie to this.  And he has no respect for Denny's time in the business.  That's terrible.  Why?  Because Denny's been in the business for years.  Years.  Why not, Sal?  Speak freely here.  He does, like, an unusual job for SiriusXM.  And you would think someone with his seniority would be doing something a little more...  Important.  Important.  Yeah.  I program music channels.  Channels. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  Channels.  Okay, that's fine.  Somebody has to do it.  If you took a little time to listen, maybe you'd learn something from the gentleman.  Yeah.  You're so right.  You know?  He's got a lot of knowledge in that head of his.  These gentlemen always comment on the music channels.  Well, Sal, what don't you like about his programming?  Well, I don't know about his programming.  I just thought he'd be doing something, making more executive decisions this many years into the business.  I thought maybe he'd be doing something important, like, maybe taking phone calls  for the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Arguing about popcorn.  Arguing about popcorn or helping you rock.  Getting pandas upset.  Yeah.  Making some stellar production. 
[01:32:30]  Don't get the panda angry!  I heard there's a Sal song out there.  Oh, the Sal song is funny.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Great.  Stupid panda song.  Where's the Sal song?  You guys talk about it all the fucking time.  So, whatever.  Or I'm just going to embrace it at this point.  Where is the Sal song?  The Sal's a cunt.  Denny, any advice for young Sal? 
[01:33:00]  He's not doing well.  He's not a bad guy.  His attitude is not good.  He's not a bad guy.  I try to get along with everyone.  You really do.  Yeah.  I try to get along with everyone.  But any advice?  Sometimes he's like my best friend, and sometimes he's stabbing me in the back.  Yeah, that's the radio show.  Any advice for Sal?  Sal, just listen to these guys.  These guys got a lot of experience.  Oh, about being at a radio station.  Just do what you got to do, and don't think you're bigger than the show.  There's a lot of guys who work here who've never played the game.  We've been in radio before. 
[01:33:30]  So, just listen to us.  Give me some advice, though.  That's just, you're just reiterating everything we've heard a thousand times.  He's talking to him like he's a moron.  I know.  Just shut up and do what we tell you to do.  I'm never going to listen to anything.  You tell me what you tell me to do, Denny.  Denny's worked for a lot of big radio shows.  And fired from a lot of big radio shows.  Oh, man.  That's the ultimatum.  You're going to get fired sooner or later, and that's that.  But like I said earlier, if you were so experienced and so fucking knowledgeable, which, okay, I 
[01:34:00]  actually take that back.  You are very knowledgeable about radio.  But why aren't you doing something bigger than dragging songs into a fucking radio?  Basically, I don't like it, but Sal is saying that you've been around for a while.  Why are you the mayor of Flopville?  My time will come.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  I'm even losing faith.  You know what?  I'm just happy to have a job.  You do the job of the shuffle.  I'm very happy to have a job, too.  But there are certain things that you really do.  You're the human shuffle.  You're the human shuffle. 
[01:34:30]  Let's see.  Let's spend three hours or just push one button.  Oh.  Poor Denny.  Denny.  I want you to win in this fight with Sal.  But Sal's not having it.  Sal's not having it.  I'm not going to let him bother me.  There you go.  I'm not going to let him bother me.  I'm not going to let him bother me.  Just a speck off the shoulder.  No.  That's true.  That's all.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, you've decided that this shitty segment's over?  That's great.  Thanks, Sal.  Sal said it all.  We should have said it fucking 20 minutes ago. 
[01:35:00]  Is it okay if I take the papers?  I'm going to go get the papers.  Get the papers.  What a non-segment that was.  You didn't think it was a good segment?  I told you it was a waste.  The guy came running down the hall.  I knew exactly what he was going to do.  Here he goes.  He went flop.  Yeah, they're putting jingles on CD there.  It's like, okay.  Wow, that's her chattering.  Jesus.  I think a good, firm, bare-bottom spanky would straighten this whole show right out.  Sal?  Yeah, I guess.  I really don't want to do it. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's what makes it sexy.  We believe you.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, of course.  We believe you when you say that.  When it's forced.  Right.  It's always sexier.  Of course you're being forced.  Yeah.  When it's against your will.  Your feet have to kick while he's doing it.  Like, no, no.  I think a good, bare-bottom spanking will bring the show home.  I agree.  And also, Sal gets very red.  His ass is going to be all red.  Absolutely warm.  And disciplined.  Look like an orangutan ass.  I think we have to.  I mean, what better way to straighten everybody out? 
[01:36:00]  The mood in here has been very strange, yeah.  A good, bare-bottom spanking, Sam.  We'll bring everyone back together.  When Troy's spanking him, he should say, you're a naughty, naughty boy.  Yes, and I think that Sal should call Troy Daddy while he's being spanked.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I agree.  Yeah.  Good bare-bottom spanking.  Bring this whole thing.  Should I use a belt?  Oh, Lord.  No, bare-bottom, bare-hand.  Not too tall.  Use a belt around his neck.  Yeah, to help him.  Yeah.  Help him get to that magic place.  Hand on the ass.  Let's go.  Come on. 
[01:36:30]  Pants down.  Let's go.  That was with the guys.  Oh, God.  Let's go.  Bare-bottom spanking.  Oh, jeez.  What?  Are you wearing underwear?  Are you going to do a little fantasy play?  Like, you got to tell him what he did bad, and then Sal's got to tell him how he won't  do it again, and you have to discipline him.  He looks like he was out in the woods.  It really is red.  I know.  I'm doing the rest of the show under protest. 
[01:37:00]  I just...  Oh, you're tapping out?  It's kind of like a baseball game.  The rest of this game is under protest.  Under protest?  Yes.  You got to film this, Spanky.  For a later review?  Yes.  Sal, you are red, and now you're about to get your ass spanked.  All right.  Why are you calling like that?  Troy Kwan is...  Yeah, what are you fucking world star hip-hop?  Why do you do that?  Turn it sideways.  We're not going to restart the video.  Why?  Yeah, because now the video's sideways.  Restart the video, you yutz.  Joe's filming for his personal collection.  Can anyone do it in portrait mode? 
[01:37:30]  You got to landscape mode those fucking shots.  Yeah.  Good bare-bottom spanking will really bring this show to fruition.  I wasn't really thinking about the framing of watching this fucking homo act.  You're the only one that has a camera in their hands.  All right.  I got it.  I got it.  The rest of us got our dicks.  We're busy.  Troy Kwan is sitting on the couch.  Get over there.  Good bare-bottom spanking.  All right.  Imagine if we had a video element to this show.  People could watch this.  Does anybody else vote that Sal should go pants fully down? 
[01:38:00]  He's going to pull his pants down.  Like penis out, I mean.  Jesus, DeRosa.  I say pants off, shoes off, socks off.  Yeah, Troy.  There we go.  That really puts Troy in the power position.  What is going on?  What do you mean, what's going on?  A bare-bottom spanking is really going to put the icing on this cake.  I want to be in the Radio Hall of Fame someday.  It's going to put the icing in my pants. 
[01:38:30]  I think that this whole show has been leading up to this.  And I think that what we need is a real.  It's been a rough day on everybody.  It'll be nice to let the stress out.  A good bare-bottom spanking will really put the capper, the nightcap, on this program.  What did you do?  What did you do?  That was so bad, Sal.  Why is Troy so angry with you?  I really have no idea why Troy is so angry with me.  Role play.  Oh, oh. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Why do you have your fucking Ethiopian stomach and your...  I don't like your dumb...  Ethiopian stomach.  Exactly.  Have you not eaten since fucking June?  I got a little bit of stomach fat.  What are you doing?  What's the matter?  Yeah, exactly.  You've misbehaved.  You brought this on yourself.  I don't know.  What do you want?  He's embarrassed that he's got a fucking rod.  You want an invite?  What do you want?  Lay down.  Yeah, what do you want?  What are you embarrassed for?  You're the one that misbehaves.  Uh-oh. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, you knew better when you were supposed to do your duties and you didn't.  Is this going to write the ship?  You're a very bad boy.  I think what's happening is the show is way off course and a good bare-bottom spanking.  You're just bringing it all home.  Here we go, folks.  This is the dance.  Sam, get that pop out of your shorts.  Get on his lap.  No, why are you insisting on that?  Get on daddy's lap.  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  That's right.  This just got really real.  Get over daddy's lap.  This is so, so gay.  How's that with daddy's lap? 
[01:40:00]  Bad boy.  You've been a bad daddy.  Bad boy.  Oh, my dear Lord.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Lord.  What is he doing?  He's taping up his ass.  Why are you taping his ass?  Roy is putting tape itself down.  Oh, my.  That looks so gay.  Well, you know what?  I feel like things are beginning to balance.  The gimbal is really balancing out nicely.  That the spanking has begun.  You sure this is what the show needed today, huh, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Just don't take this dick. 
[01:40:30]  I think what the show really needed is to straighten it out.  Is he, uh...  What?  Is he aroused?  No, he's never aroused.  Oh, really?  I think that's why he won't take his pecker out.  People are asking what happened to the show.  Well, Jimmy thinks this is what the show needed.  What happened was the show got off course,  and a good bare-bottom spanking is what we really needed to us  to straighten the needle.  You sure this is what we needed, huh?  He's taping him up.  Like, look at how red his ass is. 
[01:41:00]  Why are you saying that?  Ew.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  You too.  Wow.  What about...  Oh.  Yeah, break that tape.  Sal, your ass looks like it's got high.  It really is red.  Yeah, well, you know, that's what happens.  I bet your dinner won't be late again, though.  Yeah, that's true.  When Daddy wants dinner, I won't be late again.  That's right.  All right.  Oh!  Is that too hard, Sal?  No.  Oh.  No, he said no.  No?  What?  What?  Sam.  Don't be such a fucking pussy. 
[01:41:30]  All right, motherfucker.  Where's the belt?  Give me your belt.  I'm going to get a close-up on Sam's face as the hits hit.  As the hits connect.  Tell him that's a pussy.  Don't be such a pussy, Daddy.  Oh, God.  This has gotten...  Oh, okay.  Oh, he's taping his ankles.  Oh, shit.  He got his ankles.  No, no, no.  Oh, look.  Sal doesn't want his ankles to sit.  Oh, look.  They're fighting.  Just don't hit his head on the...  Don't hit his little tender head on the...  They're wrestling. 
[01:42:00]  Shit, are you sure this is what the show needs?  Well, I wouldn't say tape the ankles.  No, I know where this is.  Where's it going?  Like a fucking hazing?  A football camp hazing?  Yeah.  Don't...  Oh, there's a real fight going on.  This is like Sandusky's...  All right, let him up.  Don't tape.  He doesn't want to be taped.  You're going to cut yourself on the...  Yeah, he's already...  Oh, now you're all taped.  Oh, yeah.  Look at his ass.  Yeah, don't tape.  He doesn't want to be taped.  Oh, my God.  This took a fucking turn.  Is the show back on course now?  I don't know.  I feel like the spanking was wayward. 
[01:42:30]  I mean...  What?  What?  Are you bleeding?  What do you say?  Where are you bleeding?  Oh, my God.  You got punched in the nose?  Yeah.  Sal made you bleed?  Oh, nice.  Let me get that.  Oh, that's sexy now.  What happened?  That's going to make that spanking even better.  Troy, what happened?  Well, I was trying to tape his ankles.  And what did he get hit with?  I don't know.  I think his arm or something.  It's fine.  It was a mistake.  Yeah.  Nothing that they can't straighten out with a good bare-bottom spanking.  What happens is, things get crazy.  What we really need here is a bare-bottom spanking to mend relationships. 
[01:43:00]  A bare-bottom spanking.  Give me a sis, though.  This is the only thing.  We got to get back on the same page.  We got to get back on the same page and get these relationships mended.  What, in a little meeting after the show, do the same trick?  No, I think what happens is, Sal began to object, and I think what we really need is  a good bare-bottom spanking to mend fences.  And then this morning, I am watching two guys just screaming at each other. 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, Sal is furious that the work hasn't been done.  Travis is going like, what the fuck do you want from me?  Whoa!  What are you talking to me like that for?  Wow.  It was like a real, like, knockdown.  That sounds crazy.  I thought for once everyone was getting along around here.  Oh, man.  No, once you get more than three people here, you're not going to have a situation where  everybody's getting along.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, I mean, there was no sort of come in for Sal and be like, hey, man, what's going 
[01:44:00]  on?  Did you get a chance to?  Uh-huh.  And he just walked in like, what the fuck?  Gangbusters.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, that's exactly what happened.  I asked Travis, and then we were met with Andrew.  But you didn't ask Travis.  You weren't like, hey, buddy.  Did you get the, uh...  I said, I said, did you have the worst of?  Because that's just something that...  Sam told you yesterday that I didn't, so why would you even ask?  Well, I, because I specifically said to Sam, maybe he's going to do it between now and  now and tomorrow.  I don't want to, I don't, I wouldn't, uh...  Why would I fucking just, like, fabricate a situation?  Maybe you could took it home or something like that. 
[01:44:30]  But there's many scenarios.  Many scenarios.  Only worry about the problem when it's finally addressed and when you absolutely need to  come to it.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I mean, nobody told me, so I don't know how I was supposed to cut it up for you.  But how did you know that Sam informed me about that information if you didn't know?  Sam told me.  Sam asked, have you been cutting up worst of?  And I said, no.  So that's how I knew.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Sam didn't tell me, oh, by the way, I'm going to ask Sal to cut up the Lady Di phone call  for tomorrow morning.  Don't do it. 
[01:45:00]  When you told me that the Lady Di phone call needed to be on the podcast this morning,  that was the absolute first time I had heard about it.  But Sal was pissed generally.  Yeah.  That the worst of wasn't being cut up while he was gone.  Well, yeah, because now, like, when we do worst of, the right way to do it is you got  to listen to that thing in real time.  Like, you got to go back, you got to listen to...  Lucky you.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  I bet you do that off the clock, just for pleasure.  I wasn't here, so I didn't hear the show.  That's why, like, when E-Rock's doing our stuff, he supposedly heard the show that day  or that segment. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You get to bathe in our greatness.  I know, right?  For free.  Oh, my God.  What a job.  You get paid to do that?  That should be your pay.  You just get to listen to this show.  The privilege of listening again.  I love listening to you guys.  Anyway.  So, now, I didn't hear the show.  I'm sorry, not to offend you guys.  I didn't listen to the show Monday or Tuesday.  What about the part where you said, I love listening to you guys?  That's true.  You just said that.  Well, I don't want to, like, have a dick-sucking fest here, but, you know, I don't listen to 
[01:46:00]  you guys forever.  Thank you, don't.  Why not?  Geez, what the hell?  We weren't talking about dick-sucking.  Jesus.  Just brings that out of nowhere.  That out of fucking thin air.  That's a little weird.  But, yeah, so, I didn't hear the show, so I have to now go in and carefully listen to  it, and it takes a while, so, therefore, the podcast-  Nobody's saying you do.  I could do that today, but I didn't have any time to do it on Monday and Tuesday when I'm  doing the job of three people.  Oh.  It's low on the list, so.  Would you say that if you were doing the job of three people and you didn't need something 
[01:46:30]  done until Friday, you would probably push it until you had more time?  Well, one thing is we don't need that until Friday.  And wait, wait, wait, wait.  There it is.  What?  The moment where I just don't give a shit anymore.  There it was.  It was right then and there, people.  You're not interested?  I could give a fuck.  Me too.  Fuck.  Shut up.  You don't like the back and forth?  Please. 
[01:47:00]  No!  It's just ponderous and fucking-  It's tedium.  But why were you guys screaming?  I guess it's just this early in the morning, everyone's just fucking on-  Because after two days of doing three jobs, the last thing I want to hear is why didn't  you do something you didn't know about on top of all that shit?  But it said it in the email, though.  Yeah, it said in the email that I could push it off on you on Wednesday.  So that's just-  So that's what it said in the email.  That's sad, dude.  Is it really sad that I did three fucking jobs for two days? 
[01:47:30]  I always cover for everyone here.  Really?  So you've come in before and you've done the prep sheets, the news stories, you've run the  board, you've sent Audible, you've done the replay, you've pulled the live reads, you've  sent the live reads.  You've done all that before?  Really?  Yes, I can do every one of those jobs and I haven't.  And you've done it all in a day?  Yeah, there's been a scenario probably.  Really?  There's been a day where me and Eric have been out and you've had to do all of that?  Sure.  Really?  Yeah.  Go find that day because I guarantee you it has never happened before.  I'm sure there's a day where other people have been out and I've had to cover for them.  That has never happened before.  Look, I'm not getting all riled up over this.  You're clearly more upset about having to do extra work. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  When someone says you can do this or you can wait until someone else does it, I just like  me as a person, I like to just fucking do it and get it done because then I can say  I did it.  I didn't have time.  I didn't have time.  I'm sorry you didn't have time, but sometimes like, I don't know.  That's all.  I didn't have time to do it.  You're saying you should have made time.  I think five goes here.  That's all.  That's all.  I'm done.  That's it. 
[01:48:30]  I'm not getting riled up.  I don't want that in my life anymore.  I don't want to go around.  You're the one who came in with a fucking bitchy attitude.  Oh.  Bitchy.  The B word.  I asked B word.  That's not like a manly thing.  No, no.  That's like a girly thing.  Bitchy.  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  A bitchy attitude.  That just conveys like that you're kind of fruity.  I asked you if you had it and you go, I was doing three jobs.  You were told yesterday what the situation was.  I told you I wouldn't make an assumption until I came into work where all the media and all  the shit is to see if you had done it. 
[01:49:00]  There's a strong chance you could have done it at home.  So you maybe, why would I put that on you that you didn't do it?  Maybe I thought you took the initiative afterwards.  Maybe I thought there was going to be a dick sucking fest here.  Right.  Absolutely.  I was hoping, too.  That's all.  That's all.  Bitchy is like, if somebody's like, oh, you came in here all bitchy.  It's like, you're not going to take somebody seriously when they're being bitchy.  That's like the wife is being bitchy.  She's on her period.  Yeah.  That's what Travis was conveying.  Travis met with me with hospitality.  He was on the rag.  Yeah.  He was bleeding from the twat.  Yeah, he is.  Just like how he did now. 
[01:49:30]  He started getting all riled up for a while.  Yeah, because you know what?  After two days of doing three jobs, it's the last thing I want to hear.  Two days, three jobs.  We work for the show.  Sal, you're the laziest fuck here.  Are you kidding me?  How many times?  How many fucking hours?  You still don't give a shit at it?  Now he's telling us.  Sal, how many times have they brought you into the studio and called you out on your laziness?  Don't talk to me after I've done a laundry list of shit for two days.  And I didn't pull something that I didn't know about. 
[01:50:00]  Danny's job plus Audible.  I didn't pull something that I didn't know about.  Please, Travis.  Please, dude.  Come on, Sal.  I didn't know.  Come on, bro.  Do you want to specifically go over it?  I didn't.  Do you really want to specifically go over it?  Dude, do you want to do that right now?  I can't be responding.  Do you want to talk about when you leave early because you want to catch a fucking train or  whatever bullshit?  Whoa!  Don't fucking tell me there wasn't time because there's always time.  Work ethic problems.  There's always fucking time because I always fucking stay here late.  I'm always here fucking late doing shit.  And I don't fucking complain about it.  Sal, I don't complain about it either. 
[01:50:30]  What I'm complaining about is that you couldn't believe that I didn't do something that I  didn't know about.  I came in and asked you nicely and you started bitching at me.  That's exactly what happened.  This is boring, Anthony.  Thank you for talking about it.  No, no.  I'm back in.  I like this now.  If Sam had told me yesterday.  No, really, Sal?  Well, the jerk star called.  Like, I already explained this to you and then you apologized to me.  So, like, you know you're a bitch.  Because I had a bitch move. 
[01:51:00]  That's a bitch move.  Because I had to get me.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I pulled a pass.  I will admit, I pulled a passive aggressive move.  I said, I'm sorry because I didn't want to fucking hear him call me to tell me to fucking  calm down and shit anymore.  Oh, that's what you do with your chick.  I'm sorry.  You just go.  Oh, yeah.  You take the grenade just to cover the fucking problem.  Just shut the fuck up.  I'm going to go start working.  Oh!  Because you were.  Wow.  Because you were told to come in and work on it.  I had no problem.  I don't care doing the work.  It has nothing to do with the work.  I'm fine with that. 
[01:51:30]  It's a matter of that.  You know that if you just don't feel like doing the fucking work, you could pawn it off  on me.  Did anyone ever see that Star Trek episode where that cloud thing fed off the violence?  And it loved the hate that was going on between the Klingons and the Earthlings.  That is Sam right here.  I'm seeing Sam soaking up this hatred and conflict and just converting it into energy.  Which, by the way, you are also looking very happy right now. 
[01:52:00]  I love it!  You were tapped out a minute ago and you're all in now.  I'm in because then the voices started raising.  I'm like, huh?  What?  You like that.  I like it too.  Oh, I love it.  And this just feels like home to me.  Oh, no!  I'm back at my family home.  Yes!  See, the one thing I...  Wait, if I may jump in for a second.  You're diffusing, though, man.  I know.  We're losing the energy by the moment.  I know.  I don't want to, but here's...  I might stoke the flames again by just saying this. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah?  I still don't understand who is kind of in the right and who is in the wrong here.  I don't even know what really happened.  There is no right and wrong.  There is no wrong.  What happened is that Sal...  Somebody didn't do something.  No, not at all.  And someone was supposed to do it.  So...  No, no one was supposed to do it.  What?  Sal was supposed to cut something up for this morning.  Sal was supposed to cut up something for this morning.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  I would have happily done it yesterday if I knew that it was a time-sensitive thing.  It was sent in the fucking email. 
[01:53:00]  It was sent in the email, and you interpreted...  You interpreted...  You made it a projection upon yourself that I don't have to do this because Sal will do  it Wednesday morning.  In the event that we needed that material, which you didn't do...  Yeah, because I have more important things to do.  Oh, my God.  Sal, when something is not needed until Friday, I can push it a day.  Apparently, it wasn't needed until Friday.  It was needed fucking Tuesday morning at 3 a.m.  And did I know about that?  What does it matter?  It said it in the fucking email to do it.  Because that's the whole point, Sal.  If it's not timely, it can be pushed to later in the week. 
[01:53:30]  If it is timely, it'll get done.  You know...  You want to say whatever you want to say on the air, but you know deep in your heart.  You interpreted...  Uh-oh.  Deep down.  Do it Monday, Tuesday, or Sal can do it Wednesday.  You don't even fucking address the first two parts of that.  You just say, hmm, Sal.  Sal.  Okay, cool.  Oh.  Sal, when I see something can be pushed till Wednesday, I'm going to push it till Wednesday  because I've got other things to do on Monday and Tuesday.  I've been here for two years.  We've been doing it every fucking day.  Two years?  We've been doing it every...  Longer as an intern.  What? 
[01:54:00]  What?  I thought you still were.  We cut up worst stuff every day because it's something...  If Ope says, hey, do we have that clip from yesterday?  Because we could pull it up like that.  That's the fucking case.  Especially being on the board, you would think.  You would fucking think you had that shit ready to go.  Yeah.  And I would have if I needed it to go.  But I didn't need to cut up.  But you had to catch your train to get home or whatever you're more important to get home.  Whoa!  Like, you're saying there's no time.  There's always time.  You can just stay at work later.  Sal, it's a devastating blow.  You don't know what I can do and what I can't do.  Roland stays here to fucking midnight sometimes. 
[01:54:30]  You don't know what I can do.  Homeless.  Could be some food coming.  That could be a problem.  I don't know what you kind of can't do.  You're right.  I don't know what you're willing to put into the show.  You're right.  You don't...  First of all, you will never put in what I put into the show.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Like, stay an extra...  Worst of all, what does it take?  It takes maybe an extra hour from...  Yeah, I can tell.  Maybe I didn't have an extra hour.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I've got other things to do.  I understand.  Maybe I have a family at home that depends on me to be there at a certain time.  Oh! 
[01:55:00]  Okay.  Insinuating that you can't have children with a woman.  Right.  Because you can't get a boner.  Right.  Okay.  If that's more important than your fucking career...  Maybe I've got a more delicate...  I don't know what to tell you.  Ooh, what?  Time spent here, Sal, doesn't necessarily mean you're putting in the work.  You're just here.  You can be here.  I mean, some people might be able to manage their time better than you.  No.  I'm just saying that.  I like that.  I am absolutely willing to stay late to do shit.  I have no problem with doing that.  I'm not going to take any of your little baits.  I'm like, well, maybe you don't care about your career. 
[01:55:30]  I've been here nine years.  Nine years!  Holy shit.  I think I'm doing a pretty damn good job.  That's some seniority right there.  Yep.  Okay.  And that's fine.  People pass over to me.  It's perfectly fine.  But I just know...  The new kid in town.  Johnny on the spot here.  I absolutely fucking know.  Giving him shit.  You interpreted that information that EROC gave you as, I don't need to fucking do it.  Sal will do it.  No, I'm telling you, I interpreted it as, it can wait until Wednesday, and that's what  it did.  Sal, were you covering for anybody that wasn't here? 
[01:56:00]  Every time Travis is off, I cover his entire...  Sal does a great job covering for me.  Everybody does a great job covering for everybody.  Oh, that's right.  He wasn't here Monday and Tuesday.  Correct.  He wasn't here Monday or Tuesday.  Mm-hmm.  So...  And neither was EROC.  You're right.  When EROC isn't here, I cover for EROC.  When Travis isn't here, I cover for Travis.  So you and EROC weren't here.  Sam and Travis were.  Correct.  So they are covering, obviously, for you and EROC.  Absolutely.  Then you come in, middle of the week, and give people shit about... 
[01:56:30]  See, that's all I'm getting here now.  They obviously had to cover for two people down for two days.  You come in and start giving them shit?  Well, no, it was...  I explained the particular detail.  It's not the overall...  I understand what you're saying.  Of course you do.  I hope so.  But it's the...  There should have been a...  Not only not giving people shit, but a thank you.  Sometimes you just need to strip it down to the basics. 
[01:57:00]  Right!  Strip it right down to the basics.  We can...  I don't know.  All right, final thoughts.  Ah, final thoughts.  I like that.  Final thoughts is...  Summation.  In summation.  Let's get an apology from somebody.  Oh, wow.  I agree, Sam.  An apology always heals.  I already got one, so...  Oh.  Oh.  This passive-aggressive...  That was a passive-aggressive...  Yeah.  You're a bitch apology.  Yeah, that was...  You said you were sorry already.  I'm not genuinely sorry at all.  I don't need a...  Oh, man.  You say...  When you say I'm sorry to the wife because you don't want the argument to keep going. 
[01:57:30]  You're not really sorry.  Well, we all know all sorries are bullshit in it, so...  Of course.  I don't need an apology.  I know that I do a good job, and nobody knew Sal was out, so that must mean I do a good job.  Ooh.  Oh.  I don't even want to...  What?  Oh, boy.  I wouldn't want to come back from that, either.  You don't want to what?  You don't want to what?  What?  And when you're not here, dude...  You...  When I'm not here, I hear...  When I'm not here...  Yeah.  It's brought up on the air, the lower quality of the prep. 
[01:58:00]  Oh!  Holy shit, a devastating blow.  Yeah.  Ah, getting us involved.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  They were stuck.  Oh.  Oh, he's not lying.  They're undeniable truth.  Sal may be in line for the bare-bottom spanking here.  Sal, you gotta fight your way out of the corner.  Come on, Sal.  What are you doing?  Well, like, literally...  Fight your way out of the corner.  Let's go.  We're doing Sal.  Okay.  This is it.  So I'm doing Rope-a-Dope without that rope part. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, I got it.  When you write your cover email to me, it is literally only what Danny did.  Therefore, I'm not sure...  Oh, that's like Obama with George W. Bush.  The hell are you blaming fucking the past administrations?  Look, I'm not...  Look, therefore, I'm not sure what you did prior to then.  I know you do Audible now, and I was...  Now it's only because you absorbed something that Sam was doing.  So I really don't fucking know what you were doing prior to then. 
[01:59:00]  You're not paying attention, Sal.  I'm not paying attention?  Okay.  And...  Oh, God.  I can't do this right now.  Oh!  He's walking.  He's walking.  He has to.  Wait, what happened?  We're on the air.  You're gonna look really bad if you just walk.  I'm getting anxiety right now.  Why anxiety?  Why?  You gotta just speak your mind.  No, because I can't...  Don't get anxious.  Either admit...  Why are you getting anxiety?  What's going on?  Nothing.  I...  What?  What?  Oh.  You can't walk out like that.  You know what?  I think this needs...  Let's get Troy Kwan in here to...  Nah. 
[01:59:30]  No?  What?  To tell you both what you are.  Troy will say it.  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the O.P. and Anthony Channel.  Yeah, this is O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Slowly getting through all of this worst of 2013 for the O.P. and Anthony Show.  My name is E-Rock.  O.P. and Anthony will be back January 6, 2014, Monday morning, 6 a.m. 
[02:00:00]  So I know you're going to be there.  Moving on with the worst of 2013, William Shatner.  William Shatner.  William Shatner.  Every year, we have the great William Shatner on the program.  Now, I'm not saying this as a complaint.  It's fucking awesome.  And this takes place actually after the interview itself.  We found him waiting for his next interview in the hallway, which is right outside of our studio.  So it was just kind of awkward that we were done and William Shatner is still sitting outside.  So Anthony goes over to the window and reenacts the death scene of Spock from Star Trek II, Wrath of God.  Does Mr. Shatner play along? 
[02:00:30]  Well, there's a video on YouTube, O.P. Radio on YouTube.  You can check everything out.  Let's see what he does.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the O.P. and Anthony channel.  Shatner's hanging out outside the studio.  It's a Nickelback dude.  Man, I'll give away the Shatner thing.  Yeah?  Fuck it.  Giving away all sorts of shit on my Twitter these days.  I, I, I, I...  Oh, man, that's a horrible...  It's...  What the fuck?  It's smudged.  Bill!  No, it's smudged.  He cheesed out on the autograph! 
[02:01:00]  No, it's just, it's the way the...  He did cheesed out.  What, what happened?  He did, he cheesed out.  He cheesed...  Yo, Bill!  Hey!  Bill, Bill Shatner is outside in the hallway sitting next to clubs.  Well, that's why I'm yelling.  I know.  Oh, my God.  He's been there the whole break.  You want me to go get him?  That's worse than, um...  Yeah.  It's just not a good, um...  The texture of the cover.  Hey, Bill!  It's not gonna sign well.  Your autograph is smudging!  He's just staring.  He's like...  He doesn't want to cut over this shit. 
[02:01:30]  He's ignoring you like he ignored Anthony.  I, I, I, I, I...  Oh, when I...  That was a wonderful moment I had with Bill.  I, I, I, I went to the...  Well, of course, our studio here...  He just gave me a fucking dirty one.  Our studio here has total glass walls.  He's done with us.  It's glass walls on the studio.  Double glass.  Double glass.  And, um, I, I, I was knocking on it.  I was banging on it until I got Bill's attention.  Because he was outside the studio at the time.  It's very soundproof.  Very hard to...  And, uh, when he looked over, I put my hand in the Vulcan Live Long and Prosper against 
[02:02:00]  the glass and slowly fell to the ground.  And Shatner started laughing and just waved his hand at me.  It was hilarious.  You want to try to get...  I was trying to get a good, like, uh...  Maybe he didn't know what you were trying to do.  ...Rathacon moment, but, uh...  Definitely should try it again.  You want to film it?  Yeah, I'll film it.  Hold on.  All right, film it.  Really?  I'll try to... 
[02:02:30]  All right, hold on.  I'll try to get it.  Hold on, hold on.  All right.  Oh, you gotta go over to it.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Is this mic on?  You got it?  Yeah, it's on.  All right.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I have a great photo of Club Soda Kenny and William Shatner out there together.  I'm rolling.  Okay, I gotta walk like this.  Is he paying attention? 
[02:03:00]  No.  Wait.  Now he's laughing again.  Okay, he's laughing at him.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to ruin all these videos, but...  You're supposed to come over here and cry!  Why aren't you crying?  You're supposed to sit here and cry!  Oh, he's had enough of you. 
[02:03:30]  He says, I'm a hanger-on.  Oh, dude.  Such an embarrassment.  Let's get to the top of the time.  It is.  That's hilarious.  He says, I'm a hanger-on and I'm draining the white blood from him.  Oh, is he fed up with Anthony?  He has to deal with that stuff at, like, San Diego Comic-Con.  All the time.  Oh, that was so funny. 
[02:04:00]  And he comes in and wants a picture.  He wasn't crying at the glass like he was with the Spock.  I sent all your photos, by the way.  Thank you, Mr. Iraq.  Anthony asks for a photo and he says, another one.  Yeah, he remembers.  He remembers.  Another one.  He said to Opie, too, like, all the photos over the years.  I'm the only one that didn't take a picture.  I just don't do it.  Oh, Jimmy.  You're self-control.  You have self-control.  I have control.  That's a good one.  If you got one with a rock star, you don't know.  And you're creeping in my Shatner.  Am I?  Yeah, you're creeping. 
[02:04:30]  Look at this.  You're creeping.  Oh, man.  Jimmy's always poking his...  I just wanted to get, like, kind of just a picture with William Shatner.  Look at Kenny and Shatner.  Oh, God.  That could be the best picture of the day.  Jesus.  I got one.  Shatner and Kenny.  Yeah.  That is a good one.  Tweet that shit.  That's a great picture.  Yeah, I tweeted it.  Oh, that's funny.  That's a...  Whatever.  It's on my Twitter.  It is really weird that such an iconic figure...  You know, I wanted to ask him and I forgot to ask him. 
[02:05:00]  I'm wondering how many presidents has he met.  Ask him.  I'm going to guess seven.  Open the door.  Can you ask him how many presidents has he met?  We want to know.  Let's do a shout-in to you.  I don't want to ask.  Open the door.  Open the door.  I'm sure he met Reagan.  Hey, Bill, how many presidents have you met?  How many presidents?  How many presidents have you met?  I met the president of the neighborhood...  I met the neighborhood...  Just the other day.  I met the garbage collector president. 
[02:05:30]  President of the Cleaning Association.  The garbage collector association.  I don't blame him.  He's done with us.  He's completely done with us.  But he's just sitting there.  We were told he's got to go and do other things.  It would be great if you walked out and just closed the curtain.  He would...  Yeah, he should get up and close the curtain so he can't even look at him anymore. 
[02:06:00]  It's so strange.  He's just sitting there.  I guess they're letting him just chill out until he does some TV instead.  This is O&A's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  You just heard William Shatner on the Opie and Anthony show, sort of.  Again, video is up on YouTube.  Opie Radio on YouTube if you want to check that out.  The O&A show has a weird legacy of getting guests to cross over or getting guests to come  on a show that weren't booked for us in the first place.  This is one of those times where on the same day that we had William Shatner, we managed  to convince Avril Lavigne and her husband, Chad Kroger. 
[02:06:30]  He's from Nickelback if you don't know who he is.  I know Canada does, but the rest of you may not.  Anyway, they're in the hallway.  We asked them to stop in for a few minutes and they did.  O&A's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Who's that?  Avril Lavigne?  No way.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah, she's here.  What's her?  Open the door.  All right.  Avril, take a picture.  You should take one?  Yo, Avril!  Yo, Avril!  Yo, Avril Lavigne! 
[02:07:00]  Oh, man.  What's up, Avril?  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, fuck.  You doing some twerking?  That's all we get?  She just kind of puts her butt in there.  She put her hiney.  Whoa!  She's lifting up the front of her shirt.  We can officially say we've had Avril Lavigne on the show.  You want to come in and say hi?  Wait, she got a minute?  She's very busy.  Tell them one minute.  Just say hi.  Just say hi, Avril.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  How are you?  We just want to say hi. 
[02:07:30]  Just as adorable in a person.  I'm like hanging out in the hallway, and you guys are like waving through the glass.  Avril, I know, right?  What do you got going on?  Today, I'm releasing Let Me Go, which is a ballad.  It's my single.  It's a duet with Chad, my husband.  Yes.  Nice, yes.  Of course.  It's on iTunes today.  Is that who you were hugging outside?  Yeah.  I would hope.  He was patting your ass.  I would hope that's your husband.  Yes.  We should talk to Chad as well.  Did you not know that we were looking through the window?  No.  Like, someone's patting Avril Lavigne's ass.  I hope it's her husband. 
[02:08:00]  How are you guys doing today?  Good, good.  We were hanging out.  We just saw you over there.  What's up, Chad?  Good, Chad.  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Good, good.  Congrats on the new song.  I hope it does well for you guys.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  That's great.  What are you going into, Shade?  Shade 45?  Yeah, we're just kind of making the rounds.  Yeah, I hear you.  We're not a lot of steel guests.  We're usually not a lot of steel guests.  That's okay.  She looks like you guys because she doesn't normally push her ass up against the glass.  That was very nice.  That was pretty good.  Oops.  We were hoping you were doing that for our benefit. 
[02:08:30]  Good morning.  It was nice.  It could have been my ass up against the glass.  Yeah.  It's just not quite as...  We saw your mitt right on her ass at first and was like, okay, something's going on over  there.  That's why they were yelling there because I was ruining the view of your gorgeous context.  Well, that's cool.  Good luck with the single.  Cool.  Thank you.  Very cool.  We got a few minutes.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, maybe she does it.  Oh, that's cool.  Are you actually live right now?  Are you touring?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we are, man.  Are you touring? 
[02:09:00]  I'm going to start touring in February, but my new record is out November 5th.  It's on iTunes right now.  Yeah.  It's a pre-order.  It's self-titled.  I see a few pictures of you pop up on Twitter and stuff where you're playing somewhere.  Yeah.  You seem like you're always busy.  Yeah.  Working hard.  Having fun.  Happy to be releasing new music.  The fans have been great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How long have you guys been married?  15 minutes.  Oh, good.  Good, good.  We got married July 1st.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Nice and fresh. 
[02:09:30]  Nice and fresh.  That was creepy.  Nice and fresh.  What a creep.  Nice and fresh.  Will you guys do the kids thing or what?  Eventually.  Eventually?  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I have my songs on my babies right now.  Exactly.  You don't want her to bang that up too big.  Come on.  Come on.  Nice way to phrase it.  Well, you know, babies can wreak some havoc.  So I've heard.  This is going well. 
[02:10:00]  I just looked down at the table.  I just made everybody very uncomfortable.  Anyway, so it was nice to meet you.  Thank you.  That's great.  I should probably ask to take a picture before this interview goes any farther.  Let's go take a picture.  Guys, thanks so much for popping in and saying hi.  Great to meet you.  It's a amazing day.  You too.  Thanks, Amber.  Thanks, Chad.  Absolutely.  Oh, take a picture, Jimmy.  Oh, all right.  I want a picture too. 
[02:10:30]  Get away from me.  Not you.  Thanks so much.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Good luck.  There we go.  Oh, come on, Sam.  You're bothering.  Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Take it easy.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Very cool.  That was nice.  This is nice.  Amber Levine.  Very cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's like such a crush on her back in the day.  Did you, Sam?  Oh, my God.  Right?  How old is she?  She's, I think, right around 53 now. 
[02:11:00]  Probably 30.  Oh, is she?  I thought she was actually much younger.  That's the Nickelback dude, you know.  Huh?  Who is that?  That's the Nickelback dude.  Yeah.  From Nickelback, what's the lead singer?  Yeah.  Chad Kroger.  You didn't know that?  You're going to run out there and take a picture.  All right.  Look at Jimmy.  I got the camera.  They've sold a few records.  I know.  That's hilarious.  You didn't know that?  Jim's like, I didn't know.  You didn't know that was the Nickelback dude?  We've kind of taken our shots.  That's funny.  Yeah, I know.  We've kind of taken our shots.  But I think everybody has. 
[02:11:30]  I think you're safe.  Yeah.  It's the Nickelback.  Jimmy's hilarious.  He's like, I'll take a picture.  I was wearing my hat.  You should have asked him.  Because he, yeah.  A lot of people make fun of Nickelback.  A lot of records.  Give me a Nickelback song.  Give me a Nickelback.  What's the word?  By the way, do you know how good you guys could have just got me if he wasn't the singer  from Nickelback?  Oh, God.  That would have been great.  You just, because you blindly went out there.  I did.  You could have just humiliated me.  Oh.  Well, he looks different now.  He's got, you know, his hair cut short.  He's got some nice fucking quim. 
[02:12:00]  What was the fucking shooting up in?  You don't want to bang that up.  You don't want to bang up Avril Lavigne's body.  You don't want to be that guy that fucks that thing up.  The fuck?  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Sir.  Yeah.  It is worse.  This is hilariously bad.  More of O.P. Anthony's worst in 2013.  Coming up.  It is the second to last day of 2013, but it is day six of the worst of O.P. 
[02:12:30]  and Anthony, and we still have a lot more of great O.P.  and Anthony material to get to.  As for now, Anthony Weiner.  2013 was, again, the rise and fall of Anthony Weiner.  That's not a pun, even though I just made a pun.  Oh, that was fucking horrible.  Anyway, he returned to the public spotlight.  He was running as a candidate for the mayor of New York City.  During his campaign, some text messages got out of the sexual variety, and they were leaked 
[02:13:00]  to the press by a young woman named Sydney Leathers.  We received the transcripts of those conversations, and we decided we have to act them out, so we  get former intern Jackie and our own Club Soda Kenny.  The worst of 2013.  The O.P.  Anthony Show.  You can't have a mayor that types down, would you let me come on those perfect hits?  You just can't.  And we're shock jocks.  Oh, we would, you know, yeah, the material we would get from mayor fucking danger. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Mayor Carlos Danger.  It's easy to take the angle, like, of course we want a mayor that talks like this, but you  just can't have...  You don't think people would take him seriously and work with him?  Good morning, everybody.  At least he picked a realistic-sounding name.  Carlos Danger.  Max Power.  Anthony Weiner is Carlos Danger.  Yep.  It certainly is.  My God, he had a second chance.  What the fuck's wrong with this guy? 
[02:14:00]  I think he'd have been okay.  Society gave him a second chance, which is so rare.  He'd have been okay if he had stopped, and this was just some shit from, you know, a year  ago, two years ago, whatever it was.  But it turns out that this is new stuff.  When this broke once again on Twitter, before the mainstream news there, I'm like, oh, okay,  they finally got some more old shit that popped up. 
[02:14:30]  And then I'm like, what?  What?  He did this after he left Congress?  After.  What?  And his wife is standing next to him at his press conference yesterday.  And she was pregnant at the time that he went back in with this shit, right?  She's looking up at him.  He's fucking trying to look all contrite as she's giving her speech about the fact that  she loves him and believes in...  Look, man, I mean, I don't want to be part of a city where the mayor says things like...  Like?  I must have come thinking about you and looking at you 100 times. 
[02:15:00]  How does that make you feel?  Gross?  Question mark?  I said I was hard.  Help me.  I just don't want a mayor that says things like that.  And if you're texting this stuff, you're not done.  Right.  You're not done.  He's probably doing it right now.  By the way, anyone who wonders what sex addiction is, this is it.  This is it.  He's addicted, right, Jimmy? 
[02:15:30]  But this is...  People are like, ah, it's about addiction.  This guy blew his political career.  Right.  Six months later, he still couldn't stop doing it.  He couldn't stop.  Six months.  He went right back in after he left Congress, it looks like.  Oh, he's terrible.  And then he's trying to say that he stopped in November.  I don't...  You know...  Oh, my God.  No, he didn't stop.  There's no way...  There's no way he stopped in November.  People don't stop...  No, this is...  ...when they're at this extent of...  I really want a mayor that says, standing behind you, lathering with one hand, fingering 
[02:16:00]  you with the other.  I mean, go up to Albany and get some funds for the city, please.  Well, you know what, though?  This is...  He makes a good point here.  Yeah.  God, I want to take you from behind in front of a mirror.  I want to see your face and feel your pussy spasm as you come with me deep in you.  Can you imagine?  Mayor Bloomberg or Mayor Koch or... 
[02:16:30]  I got to run to take you from behind.  I want to see your face and feel your pussy spasm as you come with me deep in you.  Look, there's no goody two-shoes in this room, but this is just...  This is ridiculous.  You just can't have a mayor that's addicted to sexting.  It shows a lack of judgment, is what it is.  And if you're a politician, you can't show these lapses in judgment like this. 
[02:17:00]  Who cares what he does?  I mean, more power to him.  You want to fucking sexts and pictures, jack off.  Whatever.  You're a dude.  But again, if you want to be a politician, you don't have those freedoms anymore to where  you can do this and leave unscathed.  Now, with shock jock, on the other hand, you can do this all you want.  And he just doesn't understand how the world works these days. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  You know, you...  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Which one do you like?  I don't like this one.  You may want to be wet.  But he's huge for you today.  He's huge for you.  He's a hack.  Oh, he's a hack.  He's a sexting hack.  Called his cocky extreme.  Oh, he's a sexting hack.  Oh, God.  So, I guess, to bring everyone up to speed, Anthony Weiner, who, well, we were the ones  that officially sent the picture alluring out there.  Ruined him is the word you're looking for.  Yeah.  I think that was two years ago, right? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Two years ago.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the picture was going to get out there, so I sleep well at night.  It was just a matter of time.  We just happened to be the ones that went for it.  And then he went away, and then he comes back, and he's doing pretty good in the polls as  far as becoming the next mayor of New York City.  He's doing all right.  People are accepting him and accepting, you know, his past is his past.  And then this shit hits yesterday.  Yeah.  And the New York Times and pretty much every paper is basically saying, get the fuck out 
[02:18:30]  of the race.  You creep.  That's what they want to write on the cover.  You creep.  Meet Carlos Danger is on the front page of one of our people.  Yes.  He's terrible.  It is the worst fucking name he picked.  The Daily News.  Enough of all the lies and salacious revelations. 
[02:19:00]  Wiener is not fit to lead America's premier city.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Get it?  It's a jerk-off joke.  He had this one.  This is how dumb this guy is.  He didn't realize he was being set up.  He says, so you won't tell me what picture of me you like the most or turns you on the  most?  Only TV?  And she says, specifically, your health care rants were a huge turn on.  Oh, my God.  He fell for that?  What a dummy.  Oh, no.  He fell for that shit?  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  He should have said, like, what are you talking about?  Right.  Oh.  So, there was a press conference yesterday.  Should we play the press conference?  Should we start there, maybe?  A little bit.  Yeah, I think we should hear some of this.  All of a sudden, there was a press conference, and then we got all the sexting.  His wife having to stand there.  It's like 10 pages.  Having to stand there again.  With the juicy ones highlighted.  Oh, yeah.  Six months after he is finished, man.  There's no way you come back from this, right?  No.  Man, people never believe you again. 
[02:20:00]  They gave you a chance, too, man.  That fucking, behind closed doors, that wife has got to be, you fucking idiot.  You had a chance, and you fucked this up?  Huh?  And she's in politics.  The wife's in politics.  So, the wife is like, okay, I'm going to attach myself to this.  Yeah.  Like, it's not just a marriage.  It's also a career move for her.  Now, he's gone and fucked everything up.  Right.  What kind of politics does she do?  She used to be, like, an aide for Hillary Clinton.  Oh, right.  Like, she was, like, a real...  She was, like, a secretary or something? 
[02:20:30]  I don't know.  Some kind of aide.  Did some fucking filing for Hillary.  Yeah.  But she thought she would have a political career, too.  Well, some guys got a video inside the plane.  These politicians seem to be...  Which one is that?  That's inside the fucking...  San Francisco?  No, it's LaGuardia.  LaGuardia.  Ah.  Yeah.  That was a piece of cake.  I want to see inside the plane that crash-landed in San Francisco.  Politicians are creepy. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  I think they're creepier than radio people.  Yeah.  It's the power thing.  I really believe that.  Yeah, it's the power thing.  Absolutely, dude.  Absolutely.  There's a million of these guys.  Yeah.  Power thing.  Power thing.  Everything.  Carlos Danger is a power thing.  He does.  Carlos Danger.  That's humiliating.  It is humiliating.  Why would you fucking come up with a name like Carlos Danger? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, Jesus.  I can't even look at him.  God, I would hit that so hard.  Your pussy would beg for mercy.  Mercy.  Mercy.  Well, let's go to the press conference.  So, breaking news.  It says, Anthony Weiner, news conference on new sexting scandal.  And like I said, I thought this was like some old shit that came up.  Oh, no.  But no.  Oh, no.  Here he is live.  Anthony Weiner.  He's at the podium.  Give us a couple seconds. 
[02:22:00]  His wife's smiling.  Smiling.  See how degraded she feels?  It's time for bed, right?  Yeah.  Look at the big smile.  Yeah.  The heads poking up from the cubicle behind him are the funniest part.  The mayor of the city of New York.  Like, what?  I have said that other texts and photos were likely to come out.  And today they have.  As I've said in the past, these things that I did were wrong.  And hurtful to my wife and caused us to go through many challenges in our marriage that 
[02:22:30]  extended past my resignation from Congress.  Ah, extended past.  While some of the things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no  question that what I did was wrong.  This behavior is behind me.  I've apologized to my wife, Huma.  And I'm grateful that she has worked through these issues.  Oh, as well.  What's going on?  Hold on.  What's going on?  He's Carlos the Jerko.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The Jerko.  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:00]  He loves jacking off.  He's fucking finished.  This guy is a complete joke.  Wow.  Why is he downplaying it in this news conference?  I told you I did this.  But he's leaving out the fact that this new one came after he left Congress.  Oh, my God.  He said, which went beyond my resignation.  So he tried to hint at it right there. 
[02:23:30]  Is this a year after, though, that's saying?  I think so.  Yeah, this was last August, I think it was.  July.  A year.  Yeah, a year.  Yeah, last July.  Maybe he thought after he left Congress.  He had nothing to lose.  He's like, fuck it.  So I just don't sex.  All right, might as well continue sexting.  I have nothing to lose.  I lost my gig.  Right, it was one or the other.  And he has nothing else to do.  He's probably bored.  And then all of a sudden, like, the work.  All of a sudden, he starts realizing, oh, my God, I could actually make a comeback.  Oh, shit. 
[02:24:00]  He did some things.  Well, that stuff probably won't come up.  Oh, fuck.  I hope they don't come up.  Your rant on health care got me wet.  What an idiot this guy is.  What?  You should have went, huh?  What?  Right.  But he's an egomaniac.  He assumed that, you know, people really enjoyed his health care rants.  Whose pussy got wet hearing him yell about health care?  Oh.  It's not a sexy subject.  Oh, your cancer rant made me cum.  What?  Your health care rant especially, she said.  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:30]  He's thinking, luckily, I used the name Carlos Danger, so this won't come back to me.  No one.  Yeah, no one will know.  Yeah.  Carlos Danger.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Tied up all the loose ends with that one.  Oh, yeah.  He's smarter than we are.  Oh, yeah.  Carlos Danger.  Carlos Danger.  Carlos Danger.  He's an international man of mystery.  That really is.  Danger.  Anyway, let's go back to the press conference.  I want to again say how very sorry I am to anyone who has received the receiving end of 
[02:25:00]  these messages and the disruption that this has caused.  And my wife, as I have said, my wife and I, as I have said, are moving forward together.  To some degree, with 49 days left until primary day, perhaps I'm surprised that more things  didn't come out sooner.  I'm responsible for this behavior that led us to be in this place.  But in many ways, things are not that much different than they were yesterday. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yes, they are.  The behavior that I did was problematic, to say the least, destructive, to say the most.  Caused many stresses and strains in my marriage.  But I'm pleased and blessed that she has given me a second chance.  For the past several months, I've been asking New Yorkers to also give me another chance  to show them that I had a vision for the middle class and those struggling to make it,  and that I wanted to move forward. 
[02:26:00]  Right into her vagina.  To be reasonable, and then back, and then move forward again.  To be curious about it, and I'm going to be there and try to answer those questions  as best I can.  It is also perfectly understandable that all of you are doing your job being here in these  great numbers, and I'm sure it's not just because of the mayoral forum we're going to  have in a few minutes.  But all that being said, let me just reiterate.  Look around for the mayoral forum.  How sorry I am that I did these things, and how sorry I am to other people that got these 
[02:26:30]  messages for any inconvenience.  He's lying.  Of course he is.  Now, some have asked the question, where does this fit in, some timeline, some timeline  of the continuum of the resignation.  Look, the resignation was not a point in time that was nearly as important to my wife and  me as the challenges in our marriage, and the challenges of the things that I've done. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  And working through them.  Some of these things happened before my resignation.  Some of them happened after.  Oh, there it is.  But the fact is that that was also the time that my wife and I were working through some  things in our marriage.  I'm glad these things are behind us.  I know that this was a very public thing that we had happen to us, but by no means does  it change the fundamentals of my feelings here, and that is that I want to bring my vision 
[02:27:30]  to the people of the city of New York.  I hope they're willing to still continue to give me a second chance, and I hope they realize  that in many ways what happened today was something that, frankly, had happened before,  but it doesn't represent all that much that is new.  And now I have a chance to do something I haven't had a chance to do.  Fuck my wife.  I'm a campaign yet.  Uma, as you know, has been out there with me recently, and she had a few words that she 
[02:28:00]  wanted to say.  So my amazing wife, Uma Abedin.  Amazing wife.  Amazing wife.  Well, she was amazing.  Yeah, my lousy sexting wife.  Right.  My wife who writes LOL every time I write cock or fuck.  Right.  My wife who's obviously a horrible lay.  Oh.  Jesus.  But you know what?  In a weird way, this is what we get.  The people like the apology.  It's been proven to work.  He should be humiliated to say this.  Oh, my God.  He should be in hiding.  Well, this was early yesterday, so, I mean, yeah, look at the papers. 
[02:28:30]  He's humiliated.  I think he's surprised it made the front page.  He's hoping to get buried.  I didn't hear what Uma had to say.  What did Uma?  Hi, good evening.  She's smiling.  As many of you who have followed this campaign know, I've spent a good deal out on the campaign  trail.  Look at that.  At churches and street fairs.  She doesn't know what to say. 
[02:29:00]  So this is the first time I've spoken at a press conference, and they'll have to borrow me  because I'm very nervous.  And I wrote down what I wanted to say.  Look at Anthony when you're laughing.  I jerk off.  When we faced this publicly two years ago, it was the beginning of a time in our marriage  that was very difficult, and it took us a very long time to get through it.  Our marriage, like many others, has had its hopes and its downs. 
[02:29:30]  You know, we all like being with our husband that jerks off.  And a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where I could forgive Anthony.  It was not an easy choice in any way.  No.  But I made the decision that it was worth staying in this marriage.  She's empowered.  I made the decision.  That was a decision I made for me, for our son, and for our family. 
[02:30:00]  I didn't know how it would work out.  But I did know that I wanted to give it a try.  Anthony's made some horrible mistakes.  Oh.  Both before he was on for Congress and after.  But I do very strongly believe that that is between us and our marriage.  Well, not anymore.  It's in every paper.  We discussed all of this before Anthony decided he would run for mayor. 
[02:30:30]  So really what I want to say is, I love him.  I have forgiven him.  I believe in him.  Oh.  And as we have said from the beginning, we are moving forward.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for your time.  Oh, boy.  I'll be glad.  She is beautiful, man.  She's really fucking hot.  Yes.  Now what happens?  Does he take questions?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No prank questions got through, unfortunately. 
[02:31:00]  But do they ask you about this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This would be the topic of conversation.  Well, how would you best relieve the traffic problems in our fair city?  Mr. Danger.  Mr. Danger.  Mr. Danger.  Candidate Danger.  Yes.  Oh, God.  And he responds to it.  Candidate Danger.  Yes.  Danger. 
[02:31:30]  Carlos Danger.  Danger.  Oh, my God.  Carlos Danger.  This is so ridiculous.  You want to hear him answer a few questions about it?  I certainly do.  Okay.  Take one or two questions.  One or two.  Did your wife find out that there were messages after the resignation?  She knew all along this process as I was more and more honest with her. 
[02:32:00]  As I was more and more.  Could you pause that?  That is so telling.  He goes, she was aware of this all along and then realized, no, not all along.  The process.  And then, ah, bah, ah.  As we're honest with her.  No, as she dug up more shit and you had to fucking fess up to it.  As she continued to go, what the fuck is this?  You don't become more and more honest.  You become less and less deceptive because you're caught.  You know, a year in.  A year after the scandal, she must have said, are you still fucking doing this? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, we talked about that.  No, yeah, honey.  Of course I'm still doing this.  Much.  Oh, I thought when.  Oh.  I thought with her, you didn't want me to do it.  Oh, right.  Oh, you mean with any, but, oh, see.  I thought, see, see, I thought if I changed my name.  Yes.  Oh.  Honey, I thought you knew that's why I resigned.  I thought you talked about that.  That I could still do this. 
[02:33:00]  See, we need to communicate better.  Right.  Obviously, there's a communication problem here.  This is pretty much just, this is just as much on you as it is on me.  Right.  See, Anthony Weiner stopped.  Yeah.  But Carlos Danger.  Carlos Danger still needs to.  Ah, there's some coming in.  Carlos Danger in your ass only.  A view of my cock.  Brown finger. 
[02:33:30]  Brown finger.  He's the man, the man with the smelly touch.  Jesus.  All right, so here we go.  This is the conversation he had with a young lady, Anthony Weiner, as Carlos Danger.  We start.  Young lady from Chicago.  With Anthony Weiner's part.  Yes.  Played by Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  Oh.  Club Soda Kenny.  The entertainer.  On Facebook.  Right. 
[02:34:00]  On Facebook, it's Club Soda Kenny.  I must have come thinking about you and looking at you a hundred times.  How does that make you feel?  Gross?  That turns me on so much.  Seriously.  I said I was hard.  Help me.  Almost home.  Be patient.  So I walk into a hotel room, and you were at the end of the bed naked,  except for some amazing fuck-me shoes. 
[02:34:30]  Your legs are spread, your feet are flat on the ground,  and you are leaning slightly forward, looking completely in charge.  You know, we could always make that fantasy a reality.  No, no, no.  Yeah, keep reading.  Are you on me?  Just do that.  No.  Just so we have the whole conversation.  Okay.  And what do I get?  We'll see.  Can I tell you what I thought about last night that made me cum? 
[02:35:00]  Please do.  Beating a skeleton.  Giving some purple wood shampoo.  Putting shoe leather on a guy's teeth.  This is the worst reading ever.  He's yelling it.  It's menacing.  And then Jackie's got that Rochester accent.  But Jackie's...  I will say, I give Jackie's rendition out of 10, 
[02:35:30]  I give it a fucking 9-5 out of 10.  Phenomenal rendition.  She's all in.  Yeah.  It's just the accent that's a little strange.  We'll say she was from Rochester instead of Chicago.  No more, no more.  It's like the same, anyway.  It's similar accent, actually.  You know she's probably doing it.  That's pretty close.  Hey!  Come on home over there.  Be careful.  Careful.  I want you to fuck me like Dennis Farina.  Just a little nasally.  Yeah.  But the Rochester gals have that. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I'm all wet down there like a deep dish pizza.  All right.  Page two.  Here we go.  I slide my car.  Where are you?  Look at the date.  Yeah, it says one, two, three, four.  Oh.  It says the start bat.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  Give me your bratwurst.  All right.  I'm sorry, Kenny.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Kenny.  I slide my cock in.  You slow at first. 
[02:36:30]  You are so tight.  And then harder.  My balls slapping your ass.  With each thrust, you squeal a little.  I start to fuck you so hard, your tits almost hit you in the face.  He fucking wrote that.  How terrible.  That is awful sexting.  He's a sexting hack.  He's the worst.  You know how hard you have to picture fucking somebody and their tits are smashing them in the face. 
[02:37:00]  Smashing them in the face.  How unsexy that is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, those are big tits.  Yeah, they're A cups.  That's how hard he wants to fuck her.  I want to fucking do your A cups right in your forehead.  All right.  You reach back and spread your ass.  I want to make this happen as soon as possible.  I walk right up to you and bend down, grab the back of your hair, and put my tongue deep in your mouth. 
[02:37:30]  You grab my cock, still holding your hair and still kissing you.  I stand you up.  You're making me so wet.  I want this to happen.  Still holding your hair, now standing.  I take my other hand and finger your pussy.  It's wet.  Soaked.  I turn you around and bend you over the back of a chair.  Your pussy asking for it. 
[02:38:00]  You're a pussy.  Fuck me, baby.  Still holding your hair, I spread your legs.  Your tits are swinging already as you wiggle.  I take out my cock and I lean over and whisper,  What do you want me to do to you?  Ravage me.  Would you like me to hold your hair while you're gagging on my cock? 
[02:38:30]  Jesus.  This guy can't be the mayor.  Absolutely.  Would you let me come on those perfect tits?  I would let you come anywhere you wanted.  Me too.  Me too.  Oh, he's the worst.  Dudo.  I hear you.  I want to come in you right after master zaps me with electricity and gives me life. 
[02:39:00]  I want to throw a small girl down the well.  I'm going to come on you as soon as the villagers stop chasing you with torches.  All right, continue. 
[02:39:30]  Not pathetic at all.  So flattering.  I think about you all the time.  I can't help myself.  If I met you in a bar and tried to talk to you, would I have a chance?  Absolutely.  You're such an amazing man.  I still can't believe someone like you would pay attention to someone like me.  It's literally a dream come true.  You are a fantasy to me.  Have you made yourself come thinking about me recently?  This morning.  You are a walking fantasy. 
[02:40:00]  I don't want to just be a fantasy.  I want to take care of your every need.  Why are you awake?  What are you thinking about today?  How do you look?  I don't sleep a lot.  Obviously, I'm thinking about you.  And I've been doing some painting today.  Right now, I have no makeup on and I'm topless.  I'm deeply flawed. 
[02:40:30]  I don't read the script.  That's what you say on your business card.  I'm deeply flawed.  I'm deeply flawed.  God, I want to see your face and feel your pussy spasm as I come with me deep in you. 
[02:41:00]  You have no idea how much I want this to be more than a fantasy.  I've never wanted anyone as much as I want you.  You're perfect.  I make me insane.  More.  I'm going to come again so hard.  Trying to upload a pic, but my phone is being slow.  Try to be patient.  I like to whisper in your ear while I make love to you. 
[02:41:30]  That okay?  That okay?  I can't maintain an erection unless the Rodney King video is showing in the background.  More than okay.  Just the idea of it turns me on so much.  I want to connect with you on every level.  Standing behind you. 
[02:42:00]  Lathering with one hand.  Fingering you with the other.  Baby, you make me so wet.  I want you to slowly enter me while passionately kissing me.  Taking a shower.  Want to join me?  That sounds perfect.  I wish you would have sent that text in 1942.  Oh, shit.  You may want to be wet. 
[02:42:30]  He's huge for you today.  Oh, he?  Hell.  You always make me wet.  You always make me wet.  All of me?  Absolutely.  Wet?  Put on some shoes.  I would spread your ass so my cock hits deep.  Why would you put on shoes?  Why put on shoes?  Put on shoes. 
[02:43:00]  Put on some shoes.  I want to fuck you while we watch Stop and Frisks in the subway.  Put your dancing shoes on.  And I'll wear the black ones that Master put on me.  I want you as deep inside me as you possibly can get.  What are you wearing?  Much for me to take off?  I'd hold you by your throat.  I'm wearing a skirt and no panties. 
[02:43:30]  Easy access for you.  God, I would hit that so hard.  Your pussy would beg for mercy.  Much like the listener's ears are.  Much like many people I just pulled over for a traffic ticket.  I would hit your pussy like there was a billy club between my legs. 
[02:44:00]  I want to hit you right in the perp.  I want you to pin me over my desk right now.  Like what you see?  What?  Like what you see?  Like what you see?  I'm trying to figure out what that line was.  Come on you, I will.  He texted, like what you see.  So obviously he's sending pictures during this whole thing. 
[02:44:30]  Like what you see?  Very much so.  I was attracted to you way before all that happened.  I don't know the last word.  Yeah, it's covered up by the dirty dot com.  Probably all that happened before this.  Some of that, yeah.  Sure.  I found the perfect woman.  Gorgeous, sexy, and a little bit of my crazy.  I basically worship the ground you walk on.  You're incredible.  So you won't tell me what picture of me you would like the most or turned you on the most? 
[02:45:00]  Specific.  Wait, what's going on?  You missed the last part.  Yeah, what is it?  Only TV.  Oh.  I didn't understand.  Okay, read it again.  Only TV.  That's a key word.  Yeah, read it again.  Okay.  So you want me?  So you won't tell me what picture of me you liked the most or turned you on the most?  Only TV?  Specifically your healthcare rants were a huge turn on. 
[02:45:30]  Oh my God.  Healthcare rants.  Oh, what an idiot.  Sexy.  Sadly, my pics are out there to look at.  Have you ever?  Yes, and I must say I'm quite impressed.  Oh, Jesus.  Tell me about your pussy.  Smooth?  Very.  Tell me about your pussy. 
[02:46:00]  How humiliating.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  And he fucking bought into it.  I like your healthcare rants.  And he still went.  So he can't even deny that it's him.  Right.  Oh, what a dope.  I was reading your tweets and looking at your pics, so I thought I'd hold your wrist to settle you down.  You have no idea how turned on I am right now.  I really want you to manhandle me.  Okay. 
[02:46:30]  That's it, huh?  Wow.  More will come out.  That's it for now.  This is great, though.  This is literally like opening up a fucking new DVD box set.  You know, more episodes are right behind.  Sure.  There's more.  There are not.  This is not the end of it.  No.  They wouldn't put it all out there one day, right?  They probably would spread it out a little bit.  Now, I would like Jackie and Kenny to read a text exchange that I had recently with the old lady. 
[02:47:00]  Jackie, could you make your voice a lot deeper?  Hello, Kenny.  Hello, Kenny.  Yeah.  Yes.  Good job, Kenny.  Yeah, very good, Kenny.  Very good.  Very sexy.  Very powerful.  Yes.  Kenny is very powerful.  He's amazing.  Hold your wrists.  You're pussy.  You're pussy.  And, of course, the lovely Jackie.  Very good.  Marvelous job.  Bang-up job right there.  Marvelous job. 
[02:47:30]  Thank you.  That was very good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  Right now.  It is 2013.  It is the worst of Opie and Anthony, and I am E-Rock.  And we're going through some of the best stuff that happened.  We call it the worst, but it's really the best for the show in the past year. 
[02:48:00]  And looking forward to all new stuff in 2014, especially January 6th, when the Opie and Anthony show returns.  But for now, James Caan, legendary actor James Caan, graces his presence in the Opie and Anthony studio.  Of course, we've got to talk to him about his life.  He talks about his current projects.  And, of course, The Godfather.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Here we go.  Hey, James Caan.  There he is.  James Caan.  Hello, sir.  There you go.  Is it?  Is it? 
[02:48:30]  I'm freezing my ass off.  It is.  I'm not here.  Summer's over.  Which one of you guys is friends with Mark Cullen?  Any one of you guys?  Mark?  Cullen.  I know the Cullens.  Jimmy.  Rob Cullen.  Yeah, Rob.  Jimmy knows him, yeah.  What did you think I said to start with?  Mark.  Did you say Mark or his brother?  The Cullen brother.  No, she's in Rob.  Yeah, no, I know him.  No, that's it.  No, then I'm in the wrong show.  No, I do know him.  He said he was a good friend.  That can't be you.  Rob Cullen, yeah. 
[02:49:00]  No, if you say I know him, that would indicate that you're really not a good friend.  No, I am.  Rob Cullen, his brother, I think his name is Mark.  Do one of them produce your show?  True.  Yeah, the show work.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Then I do know that.  So maybe, I thought you'd go whoopee-doo, because he said make sure you say hello there.  What's your name?  Jim Norton.  Sure, that's him.  Yeah.  I'm just happy to see James Conn.  That's all I am.  I'm very happy you're here.  Yes.  I kind of shocked you.  Yes.  I understand. 
[02:49:30]  I watched your show yesterday.  I get it.  You get it.  A little bit.  Oh, I got to put these things.  A little shocking.  You don't have to.  Yeah, yeah.  You do whatever you want.  Wear it in the same room.  I swear to God, I walked out of the hotel and people thought I was in there.  It's a little cold today for a t-shirt, James.  Not when you're tough.  Tough guy.  Tough guy.  God damn, you look great, man.  Thanks.  Not you, Jimmy.  And this is without makeup, too, bro.  Yeah, I know.  That's why we like you.  You're very naturally handsome.  Thank you very much.  The show, I like to promote the show, it's called Back in the Game, and it premieres tomorrow 
[02:50:00]  night on ABC at 8.30.  And I saw the pilot episode, which is you play the father of a girl and the grandfather  of her son.  And there's some really amazing dialogue, considering it's ABC.  TV has changed.  Oh, no, we're going further.  You're going for it?  We're trying to move the show after the Kimmel show.  It'll be like 12 o'clock.  Yeah, yeah.  ABC, we give them like three horrible things, figuring, well, they can only lose two of them. 
[02:50:30]  So I've heard that from everybody.  They say that they give them a couple of options that they know they're going to throw out just  so they go to the one you wanted in the first place.  I mean, yeah.  And it's 8.30.  We want to go on later.  But these colors, I mean, and the whole writing staff is great.  I mean, it's really fun.  So, I mean, I'm actually having a lot of fun with it.  And I mean, racial, terrible.  I mean, and I play a guy who just doesn't give a crap.  But I'm trying to create the most horrifying guy that is ever on television. 
[02:51:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  But with a heart.  Oh, okay.  With a heart.  It's like you never see it.  Deep down.  You never see it.  No, he raises his daughter like from the time she was 8, you know, as a guy.  Right.  Oh, shit.  He lost his money.  Because he was a baseball player.  He was like the set and coming to Sandy Koufax for 11 minutes.  He dragged himself out of the league, blew his arm out.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  So he raised his girl to the point where he called a junior. 
[02:51:30]  That's healthy.  And there's a couple of lines.  And then she's forced to come live with me.  She hates me.  Way after she gets divorced with her husband, from her husband, as opposed to an elephant.  And brings, you know, my grandson out, who I never called the right name.  Donnie.  And they move in with me, you know.  And he's terrified.  And every time the kid, I give him these life lessons.  Some kid's bully.  I look.  Walk up to him.  Right.  Flick your lick secret over his arm. 
[02:52:00]  You see how he turns his head.  And many times he's like, you hit him across the knees with his back.  The kid is great.  He goes, I'm not hitting a kid with me.  And I don't smoke.  He goes, it's just the same.  That sounds like advice my dad gave me.  My favorite line.  She comes up.  She goes, I'm going to ask, well, how quite?  What are you talking?  Bring me up like a guy.  And you're bringing me up like a guy.  I said, what do you talk?  She says, well, when I got my first period, you told me to walk it off.  Well, there was no internet then. 
[02:52:30]  I know.  So it's pretty.  It's pretty.  The language is amazing on this.  The things they say.  I'm like, I forgot it was ABC.  It feels more like an AMC show or something.  It doesn't feel like network television.  But you know what?  Some people who complain, say, geez, you've got kids on the show.  It's not about baseball.  Baseball is like 20%, but it's sort of like the social club where you meet everybody, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the parents.  And we got kids that are amazing.  Not actors.  Other than Griffin, you know, and Michael.  They're real kids.  I mean, and they haven't got one ounce. 
[02:53:00]  Not one gene of athleticism in them.  Not one.  So they'll never win a game.  If the show goes 20 years, they will not win a game.  Maybe a run or two.  Where'd you get the kids from?  Because it's.  They in 2000 and they just took real kids.  Because you're hitting on something.  It takes me out of so many movies now and TV shows because these kids were brought up in acting.  And you can tell.  Yeah.  But you can tell there's something that they're missing.  You want to slap them in the mouth. 
[02:53:30]  Yes.  Because you could tell they're just acting.  I know.  My kid is.  It doesn't feel real.  The best kid ever.  He brings me a shirt like one day because there's no beer, no dad.  You know?  He's just like, I just drink beer all the time.  Call him the wrong name.  I mean, but there's things we make up.  Like he comes in.  He has to be like he's in love with this girl.  That's why he wants to play baseball.  Because.  He's trying to get laid.  No, because he loves this girl and she likes ballplayers.  So that's that whole thing.  He comes one day and he asks about. 
[02:54:00]  This is one of the shows about sex stuff and girls.  I go, don't talk to your mother.  You know?  Kershaw's fishing.  You know?  Leave me alone.  So he says, I can't talk to her.  So now he convinces me.  And the first thing I say is, look.  With one hand, you got to learn to do this.  You have to unhook the bra with one hand.  And he goes, why would I do that?  They wrote a line saying where the boobies live.  Not funny.  And I said, let's start again.  Okay?  And then the next thing you come back to the conversation. 
[02:54:30]  Now when the candles are lit and the room smells nice.  You got the day, you know.  They even had some lines that it's not going to work.  Buy your nails.  I mean, stop.  Crazy.  Crazy.  So then I say to him, and then you put in a little Sinatra of Barry White.  He goes, who's Barry White?  Okay, that's it.  Come on.  And I take him.  And I take him to a massage parlor.  I mean, but it's a nice thing, the girl.  I'm sorry. 
[02:55:00]  But it's insane.  And it's really funny.  There's a funny scene where the staff is.  That's where the girl's getting picked on that the kid likes.  So the bully, the kid faces the bully and kisses him on the mouth.  It's like a really weird moment where the kid kisses another boy on the mouth to stop him from picking on another girl.  I'm like, they're getting fucking ballsy on television.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But his line is, he says to the girl, he says, don't worry, he'll be afraid of me from now on the day.  I'm going to be afraid.  Yeah.  No shit.  They're going for it.  Yeah, they really are.  But we have jokes like, I mean, there's this one show. 
[02:55:30]  I mean, I saw it the other day.  It was, I mean, hysterical.  I mean, I couldn't laugh.  Everybody was laughing, so you'd miss the punchline.  But the whole premise was that I'm so angry, I'm breaking things, I'm yelling at the kids,  some guy just flying one of them, you know, those phony helicopters around my field.  Yeah.  I go black hog down, I'm laughing.  I'm insane.  So, so, they go, what the hell is he so mad about?  And the kids go, you know, you need some of that good stuff. 
[02:56:00]  Maybe he needs the good stuff.  So they flashback, and I'm watching, like, from here to eternity, we got the clip, you know,  when the wave rolls up and they're kissing.  And he's saying, oh, that's the good stuff.  So, now they decide, oh, we got to get them a date.  So they go online, and then they send the kids out, like, in a shopping mall, you know,  like, if they're wearing rings, forget it.  If they have a cap, something go for them, whatever, all these stupid things.  So they fix me up with this nice girl who starts it. 
[02:56:30]  And she tells me, come on, you got to be there.  You got to meet Dottie, like, you know, in a half hour.  I says, no, I'm blowing that off, Kurt.  Like, I got to finish this salmon jerky before it expires, you know.  And I got a silver toothpick that I used, because I saved a ton of money on toothpicks.  I said, do you wash it?  I said, what, am I going to give myself something?  Why do you take me for it?  I mean, it's just really.  So, anyway, the upshot is I have this dinner, and my daughter introduced me.  You know, this is Dottie Sanchez, and she's got a 20-year-old, lives over there, 21-year-old. 
[02:57:00]  And she has a dog, this cute little dog she calls Kevin Kline, and da-da-da.  And then the woman says, yes, you know, when he was little, a little puppy had such a cute little face,  I thought I'd call him Kevin Kline.  I haven't said a word.  And I just look at her, I go, and goodbye.  And I go.  So I get this lush hooker.  I bring her home.  I mean, she's, this girl is so funny.  She's got one of them, one of them coughs, you know. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, just brutal.  This is hanging out of me, just brutal.  So she comes home, she comes to the house, she comes to the house, and she's, oh, you  got two cups of coffee?  I go, she's going to wake her up, you know.  Oh, shit.  Now here she comes, you know.  So, like, one of the lines is, what's the matter with her lungs?  I go, nothing wrong with her lungs, she held her breath like a dolphin.  Oh, shit.  But it goes like, you know what I mean?  Like, it's amazing, you know.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:58:00]  I think you just saw the ones that go, and I couldn't believe it, I improvise every once  in a while, like, my daughter comes in, she's got a sour face.  There was no, there was no line between her walking in, she looked miserable, sat down,  I go, what's with the face?  You got a problem with your she-gina?  They go, what?  They started laughing.  Jimmy, you can't say that.  Okay.  You got a problem with your lady-gina?  I think it's the gina part.  And it went like this, inner walls?  No.  They left she-gina in, because it was cool. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, they did.  Yeah, they thought, okay, that's not so bad.  Right.  Good for you.  A lot better than inner walls.  Right, right, right.  Had you turned down network TV before, or is this something that you avoided for a long  time, and now you finally saw a script you liked?  Yeah, because, you know, the truth is, there's this unwarranted stigma, you know, always  had, listen, I turned Brian's song down four times, for the wrong reasons.  Man.  But, you know, you got to behave the way the people who, are you ordering pizza, by the way?  No, I was ready to take a picture of you, because you're alleged.  Oh, no, I mean, if you want, I don't want any anchovies. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, no, if you really need to know.  I thought I was out with one of the, you know.  I'm sorry.  If you really need to know, you're a legend, I'm taking a picture.  I think they must have some kind of sex playing these girls now with us.  You know, that, like, whenever they text?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's on the tip of the finger now.  That's where the G-spot is now.  James, smile.  If we're going to do this, let's do this proper.  So far, you guys have made me laugh, okay?  Well, you're making us laugh, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Please.  So, the phone's down.  So, you turned down Brian's song four times.  Because, why'd you turn it down?  No, again, because it was a TV movie, right? 
[02:59:30]  You know, like, at that time, it was like, if you did television, you're out of the business.  Right.  So, you had to behave the way the people who are hiring you or running your life, the way they thought, you know?  Mm-hmm.  But then, I'm so sick that I literally thought, after three or four times, we're going to Rensselaer, we're going to work out the way.  And I thought I was better than the back they had.  I had a guy named Don Shai.  And in my mind, I said, you know, I could, I could, I played a little at Mission, but very little.  So, I really thought I could make the team. 
[03:00:00]  And I was in the middle of every scrimmage.  Oh, the producers were going crazy.  And those guys killed me.  I said, after my 12 hits, 10 hits, I go, listen, I'm an actor.  Leave me alone.  Yeah, exactly.  I was like, you know, phone, you know, butt kiss.  I mean, just boom.  Wow.  But the same with this, you know?  And my son started yelling at me.  He goes, what are you?  And the truth is, the pictures today, I mean, I've lost my ability to fight prehistoric. 
[03:00:30]  Monsters.  Jump from building to building, what have you.  You know, I just, my birth certificate is just not.  There's not the stigma on television anymore either.  I don't get the girl.  I accept that.  So, you know, I'm not putting on any funny costumes.  They don't look that good anymore.  So, I mean, what's left are basically, you know, anything that I like.  I did one very, with a great director named Guillaume Canet, who's married or lives with,  but they're French. 
[03:01:00]  You never know the difference.  But Marion Coutier, who's just brilliant, you know?  And Zoe Saldana, Clive Owen, Billy Crudup.  I mean, a great cast.  So, that was one.  But the other three or four that I was forced to do, they asked me what the name of it was.  And I said, what was the name?  And I picked that called The Rent.  Every one of them were called The Rent.  I mean, I really, like, you know, the integrity that you try to hang on to, you know, there's  a point.  I got four wives and five kids.  I got to see.  Jesus Christ.  When you did The Godfather and you started, like, shooting, and obviously that changed 
[03:01:30]  your life.  How did Brando treat you?  Oh, he got along great.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Before and after.  I'd say anything and he'd laugh.  I mean, it was just.  Oh, shit.  He's the best.  Was that the part you initially read for or no?  Was Sonny the part you originally went for or did you go for, had you gone in for another  screen test first?  No, no.  That whole story is such bullshit.  It is.  Francis, when Francis got there, I had done the, with Duval, who's like my oldest friend 
[03:02:00]  in the business, you know, or in the business, period.  One of the two.  But when Francis got the picture, I was with the Evans at the time and at first they were  looking at Gustav Garvis, who didn't see a wonderful, but Francis was so perfect because  he's a Mediterranean Italian, a Brooklyn Italian, you know?  So if you look at the picture, I think the success of the picture had to do with, you  couldn't condone everything because it was for the sake of family. 
[03:02:30]  You know, people would say, was that a real horse's head?  That's all I cared about.  80 people got their heads cut.  But it's true.  You know, if you did it for my sister, I did it for your brother, you did it.  So, and that's what made it, I think.  And he was like, you know, music and art.  Anyway, this first cast immediately was, was Bobby and Al, who, you know, we didn't know  at the time, myself and Brando. 
[03:03:00]  So the geniuses would now take all the credit.  So if you mention Brando's name again, you're fired.  You can't mention him.  And then Al, you know, Al was wonderful, but I don't know.  He was sort of shy.  I don't know what it was.  So he wasn't shining on these.  And we went up to, to Zoetrope and for about four, the price of four cam corned beef sandwiches,  we did these tests on 16 millimeter, you know, Eleanor, his wife gave us a haircut with a 
[03:03:30]  bullet.  It's like a bad picture.  That's unbelievable.  Swear to God.  And so then we went home.  See you later.  It was the cast.  Now all of the stuff started, you know, these people who think for a living or get paid  to think for a living rather.  They, you know, oh no, you can't, Brando, we don't want Al.  So about two, three months later, Francis is preparing everything.  And he calls me one night.  So it had to be about three in the morning.  It's their time.  He goes, Jimmy, I said, what?  I had done the rain people with him already. 
[03:04:00]  He says, they want you to come and test.  I said, what, you got a Porsche you want me to drive around the block?  He says, no, please, don't even go there.  I said, please, just come in.  So I go, and now all of a sudden I'm testing for Michael.  I want you to play Michael.  Michael?  No.  I mean, but I knew Francis.  Francis was not one of these guys that hit and miss.  This guy was like the best.  At the time, you know, other things, you know, happened in life. 
[03:04:30]  He's still, you know, brilliant.  But then there was nothing better.  But he had, you know, visions.  He wanted Michael to be the Sicilian-looking one, the authentic, you know.  And Sonny was the Americanized version of, you know, so he had even the looks that he wanted.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  So I knew that was wrong.  And I just, I mean, it was horrible.  And then they tested the Bobby thing.  And, you know, and Pooza wrote a book, The Making of the Godfather.  This is Sirius Raider, right?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:05:00]  Go for it.  So Mario, in a book, said, if Con had Titsy, he'd have played Kay.  So, but I knew what Francis wants.  So at the end of the day, he'd sneak Al in again, you know, and they'd go crazy.  They really didn't want Al.  Wow.  No, but here's the, and every actor you could name was sitting in this room on a floor, this huge room sitting against the floor.  It was disgusting.  You know.  Wow.  You name him.  The big, with stupidest accents you ever heard.  Italian, you know, Irish. 
[03:05:30]  Whatever.  Didn't matter.  They were all there.  And after this all day at 10, poor Francis.  And I go home.  And then at one point, they had this Carmen Caridi guy who was going to play me.  I was going to play Michael.  So I was nauseous.  Yeah.  I go home.  And then Roddy and the girl that was one of the runners of Paramount at the time.  Oh, gosh.  Anyway, senior moment.  They came, they came, they came into the, and I said, stick this picture up your ass. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  Wow.  And Bobby says, I'm throwing him out of the 34th, 30th story window.  I'm gone.  And I jumped on a train.  I was in such a hurry.  I'm not testing again.  I jumped on a train and went and did this 10-day part that they made part of the deal.  Jimmy, would you do this before you're coming to the Godfather?  So I did this picture in Chicago.  And then that night, they, you know, they called back and everything was set.  Wow.  So basically, my point is, they spent, at the time now, $450,000, which is like $40 million today. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's a whole movie budget.  $450,000 on tests.  And they wound up with the same cast they had for the four companies.  That they started.  When they started.  That's like a General Electric product.  Progress is our most important product.  When did you know the movie was going to be a masterpiece?  When did you realize, holy crap, we got something?  Never?  No, no, no.  No, look.  Because you never know officially.  You could have a great cast and all that.  That's the answer.  I knew, which to me is a huge ingredient, you know, like, that we all liked each other. 
[03:07:00]  I knew I was really good people.  And we laughed, you know, and that's, I don't care.  You know, you can go to movies and I'm not one guy that says, like any other guy, you know,  either get moved, I don't get moved, I have a good time.  You know, I don't sit there and analyze it.  But you can always tell inadvertently that the people are liking each other.  I don't care what the subject matter is, you know.  Huh, yeah, yeah.  Somehow it comes off the screen.  So we had that.  I had great actors with me. 
[03:07:30]  The head of every department, this is all Francis is doing.  Like Dean Tabaleros was nobody.  He became like, you know, one of the great set there.  Walter Murch became the sound guy in the business.  Gordie Willis, you know, became the.  So every one of these departments had Dick Smith, who's like a genius, you know, special  effect, makeup special effect.  Uh-huh.  All these people were put together by Francis, you know.  And they wound up being like amazing artists.  The top in their field.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  That's a talent being able to just identify that. 
[03:08:00]  No, that's the point.  Yeah.  He, you know.  And how old was Francis at the time to be able to butt heads with a studio like that?  33.  And he's making a masterpiece.  It's amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  What was Luca like as a person, the guy who played Luca?  Because he's, I'm hoping he wasn't really like that guy.  Oh, yeah.  Was he really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My friend who introduced me to it was here with me today.  But he was, I mean, one of the great.  I got so many great stories with Luca. 
[03:08:30]  I mean, he was the big, scariest son of a gun.  Yeah, yeah.  But when he was on the set, he was like a little girl, you know.  Really?  And he talked like this.  You know, very, almost he had feminine moves.  Really?  You know.  So, and this is genius of Francis.  It's hilarious.  It's a good story.  And you got a long, boring show.  Absolutely.  Believe me.  Until you walked in, it was three hours of mediocrity.  We need you to stay till tomorrow.  So, Lenny comes in.  Now, he weighs about 350.  About 60.  He had hands like shoeboxes. 
[03:09:00]  He is what he's big.  I mean, his fingers, like, he was just.  He was the masked marvel years ago in the wrestling world, which was like a famous wrestling.  And anyway, you know, he did work with, you know, with some friends.  They, you know, whatever their business was.  Anyway, he was, he was, you know, he was just one of the fellas, you know.  Right.  So, now they see this guy.  They go, oh, my God.  You know, it's Luca Brasi.  So, I think one of the first scenes we did, and he was like so scared.  I can't explain it to you. 
[03:09:30]  His chest.  I mean, they don't make clothes.  So, he had this dark, and he was a real black Italian, what they call black.  He looked like, you know, this Indian.  So, he's walking around.  And the first scene, he had to come in the door.  So, he had a close-up.  The door opens.  Brando's behind him.  And, and he comes in.  Luca comes in.  And he says, Don Collio, I am happy to be here on the day of your daughter's wedding. 
[03:10:00]  May your first child be your masculine one.  Francis goes, cut.  All right, Lenny, a little more.  A little more.  Okay.  Okay, boss.  I am.  But that staccato thing, you know.  Now, he grabs me on the side.  Francis says, Jimmy, do something.  Do something.  Me? 
[03:10:30]  I'm not even going to see.  But he knows I know.  But my friend, you know, friend.  Do something.  What do you want me to do?  Loosen him up.  Do something.  I don't care what you do.  But do something.  Loosen him up.  So, I take him over.  I take him in the corner.  And we'll talk.  And I go, Lenny, hey, come on.  We got to have some fun.  We got to make a slam.  What?  He's got a tongue.  You know, it looks like, you know, a shoe.  So, I said, look, when you come in, right?  It's a close-up.  When you say, Don Colleo, stick your tongue on it. 
[03:11:00]  And I put F, F you on it.  You can say it.  You can say it.  Fuck you.  No, far away.  No.  I put fuck you on his tongue.  Yeah.  And a piece of tape.  But I said, come, let me put the, Jimmy, don't do this.  Come on, Lenny, stop.  Please, don't do this.  Like a little kid.  Don't make me do this.  I said, Lenny, you got to do it.  We got to have some laughs.  It's just for laughs.  Well, this took 20 minutes.  Please, I'm not.  Don't make me call my friend. 
[03:11:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Anyway, he does it.  They open the door and he goes, Don Colleo.  Well, everybody laughed.  Brando laughed.  Everybody laughed.  So, Lenny felt pretty good.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Let's do it again, right?  Don Colleo.  Nothing changed.  But Brando was so funny when he went, he answered me and went, Luca, and fuck you, too.  I'll tell you the genius of Francis.  This is really genius. 
[03:12:00]  That was shot.  The interior of that was shot three weeks before we did the outside.  The scene that preceded it.  You know, the wedding?  Mm-hmm.  And all of a sudden, it was never in the script.  He's got Luca in the corner, if you remember, rehearsing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was perfect.  You know, it was like, Don Colleo, and I am honored to be.  So, he had to add that.  Now, he put that in.  It was great.  So, it was like, it was a rehearsed speech.  Now, it justifies how he sounded in the room.  Yeah, it was a rehearsed speech.  And he was nervous, you know. 
[03:12:30]  That's perfect.  That's a great story.  That's amazing.  And the kids ran in, and he just left it, right?  Wasn't that an accident when the three children ran in during Luca talking to him?  Yeah, I heard that the kids just kind of ran in, and he left that in.  I don't know.  He left, you know, we did a lot of accidents.  Because it's hilarious.  That was hilarious, because he practiced so much, and then the kids screw it all up for him.  On your daughter's wedding, for your daughter's wedding.  He fucking stumbled.  But it was all perfect.  Oh, it was great.  But it all became perfect, because you see him studying, like, sweating like this. 
[03:13:00]  That's right.  It's brilliant.  Yeah, he really was.  He did not give a smooth delivery.  He was looking down at the paper.  At least, one thing to say, he's going to look at the paper.  It's just a killer.  That's what he was supposed to do.  Lenny was a piece of work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was in The Jerk with Steve Martin.  He played, I think he played Iron Ball's McGinty.  Steve Martin kicks him in the balls, and he's got a fucking metal balls, and Steve Martin hurts his foot.  They were all such iconic characters that everybody from The Godfather, when you saw them after that, you'd know, you know, oh, that's the guy from The Godfather. 
[03:13:30]  Right.  Lenny was, I mean, off camera.  I told a story last night.  It's one of my favorite.  We were all, a bunch of us, you know, from, you know, the city pals, you know, all my good friends.  And we decided to go with the, you know, one of my friends would like to, you know, throw parties in his neck.  Benny Gooden was playing in the Rainbow Grill, right?  The whole band, and that's a small place, so you can imagine what the tariff was. 
[03:14:00]  It was, like, stupid.  So, Lenny was notoriously one of the cheapest guys.  He never had more than $20 in his pocket.  I saw somebody give him $10,000.  He'd send $9,000, you know, $980 home to his wife, right?  So, he only had $20.  So, we go up, we go up to the Rainbow Grill.  There's six, six of us, five, six of us sitting at the table.  I'm just having drinks, but it was a dinner show.  But how do you pay Benny Gooden's band, you know? 
[03:14:30]  So, everybody's in tuxedos from Park Avenue, you know, paying, I don't know what happened.  So, all we had was a couple drinks, you know, with this and Benny Gooden, it was great, this and that.  And my friend, who always grabs the bill, you can't get the bill, he grabs the bill, he says, give me the bill, and he grabs the bill.  And he never says anything, but this was so ridiculous.  He says to me, he says, geez, these are phone numbers.  He says, well, we buy this freaking place.  And then, with that, Lenny overheard, he goes, I'll take care of it. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, no.  And we both looked like, it's just impossible.  He's not, you know, especially after guys, he says, what'd you say?  He says, I'll take my friend, just to see what would happen.  He goes, yeah, good, yeah.  So, that Lenny's sitting, and he had a glass full of ice.  And there's like seven or eight guys behind us with three, four women, this huge table.  Took the ice, just chewed over his throat, right in the middle of the table.  He says, hey, you dirty, this or that, you know, and it took Lenny about a half hour to get up. 
[03:15:30]  He went, ooh, and he stood up like that.  He had two guys like holding him off the ground like this.  Here come the manager, you know, running over.  He said, please, please, what are you doing?  And then he says, whispers to him, you want this to happen every Saturday night?  Give me the bill.  He goes back, and he says, come on, I took care of it.  Wow, what a great story.  Fucking horrified people in real life. 
[03:16:00]  He was the real deal.  He was funny.  He was a good guy.  We're being told you got to go.  You got a lot of press.  You're a busy man.  We could talk to you all day.  Busy man today.  I'd like to sit here.  Yeah, really?  The rest of the crap ain't that interesting.  I'm really comfortable.  Fucking great, man.  The show is, and I saw the pilot.  It was very funny.  And the dialogue, it's very hard to believe that it's actually on network TV.  It's really good to hear that they're going for it.  I'm not surprised that Cullen brothers are involved with this.  I did not know they were until James came in. 
[03:16:30]  No, but Rob, there are a saint of people locked up.  I know.  I know.  He's just mad.  And the staff is great.  You know, Maggie and, you know, my cast is just unbelievable.  Ben and the kid.  And the girl that plays Lulu is unbelievable.  So, I mean, it's really nice.  The kids are great.  And I like getting up in the morning.  And that's worth a lot of money.  Yeah.  Unlike you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's miserable.  The show opens with you bashing a car window with a baseball bat. 
[03:17:00]  No, it opens.  Oh, they do the trees throw.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how the show opens.  And it's just a very interesting opening to a sitcom.  And it's called Back in the Game.  And it's fucking James Caan.  It's great.  And again, the Cullen brothers, very fucking funny guys.  So, I'm very happy to involve them.  Well, Mark's married.  So, he's, you know, he's got to be, he is more executive-like or tries to control it.  And when we first got together, and they wrote it for me.  They said, I'm right back. 
[03:17:30]  And all I remember, Mark, saying, now I have two of them.  James Caan, what a pleasure, man.  Thanks so much.  Well, thanks, guys.  Great time.  Thank you.  I want you to come do my radio show.  Oh, where is that?  Not yet.  I'm happy.  All right.  We'll do that.  We'll do it for sure.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[03:18:00]  Continues right now.  Yeah, now.  Now.  Welcome back.  My name is Erock, and it is the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony Show.  And 2013 was the year that we met Dennis Falcone.  The first time, I believe, was during Tequila and Donut Day.  Since then, he immediately rose to popularity on this program just by being himself.  By giving us the ins and the outs, the ups and the downs, the do's and the don'ts of the radio industry.  And sometimes, being yourself can be your own undoing. 
[03:18:30]  As we see here in this segment, we hear from Denny as he talks with Nicole and her husband about her pregnancy and some comments that he made on the after show.  Then, it jumps to Opie and Anthony discovering Denny's comments just a few days later.  Denny and mashup Nicole, I can't believe what he said.  Listen to this.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Nicole.  Yeah.  You came on.  Yeah.  After Opie and Anthony Live on Friday.  I know.  I feel like they're mad at me. 
[03:19:00]  And you announced to the world that you're expecting a child.  Yeah.  A girl.  A girl.  This is exciting news.  I know.  Now.  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on.  I know.  But you make this a whole family event for the first time ever.  Now, you've told a lot of stories on this show.  Yes, I have.  We've talked about your partying days.  Uh-huh.  Talked about your many sexual exploits.  Yes.  With your husband.  Before your husband.  I'm assuming not during your time with your husband.  I mean.  I don't know.  No.  We don't know for sure. 
[03:19:30]  We don't know.  We haven't gotten there.  But for the first time ever.  Yes.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  Your husband.  Yes.  Is here.  Yes.  Holy cow.  Mr. Matt Biggins is here.  Easy guy.  Easy guy.  Easy guy.  What are you doing here?  I'm just conducting some business, Sam.  Yeah?  As usual.  You look like you're conducting business.  I am.  I'm a business conductor.  You got your suit that fits on.  Well, it's a blazer.  Yeah.  We'll get there.  You got pants?  No.  Okay.  Pantless day.  It's serious.  I'm glad you're here, actually, Matt.  And I'm glad you're here, Nicole, too.  Yeah.  Because there's something that I haven't been meaning to address. 
[03:20:00]  Eric.  You in there?  Who's in there?  Yeah, I'm here.  Get Danny up here.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Don't.  Let's not do this.  No, I want to talk to him.  I don't want to do this.  It's a weird thing.  I know it's weird.  What do I have to do?  I want to talk to Danny.  Have you met Danny, Matt?  I don't know.  So what?  You're up here just conducting some business with the company, and you thought you'd stop  in and say hello?  I wanted to see my favorite radio DJ.  Where is he?  I'm just kidding.  I know it's me.  Actually, it's Stan.  Oh, yeah.  I bet it's Stan from the morning mashup.  You know Stan's not here because he took the week off because it's his birthday.  No, it's not. 
[03:20:30]  It's his birthday.  It's his birthday.  He took the week off because he's a man of a certain age at this point.  He's 12 years old, apparently.  Yeah.  How do you feel, first of all, Matt, about when your wife comes on the show and explains  some of her more private moments, shares that with us?  I feel very proud.  You do?  You do?  You do?  You do?  You do?  I feel proud?  Yeah.  I was the one that locked down the real girl that we all know and love, Nicole.  Right, right, right.  Do you hear a lot of the real girl that you all know and love?  I met her at a bathroom stall.  Okay, so it's not a surprise.  Nothing's going to shock me.  In a bar at 3 a.m. 
[03:21:00]  In a bathroom stall.  She called, actually, yeah.  It was super romantic.  Is that where you were intimate together for the first time?  That's where the baby was made.  Oh, stop.  That's beautiful.  That's beautiful.  Speaking of the baby, Dennis.  The baby.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Matt, do you know Dennis Falcone?  Dennis, pleasure to meet you.  How are you, buddy?  Dennis has been in the radio business for quite some time.  He worships the radio business.  He's as old school as they come.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  He loves, he's all about, as he says, he's theater of the mind.  Yes.  Right?  Is that right, Dennis?  That's right.  And he's all about talking to your audience because, as far as he's concerned, 
[03:21:30]  One-on-one.  The one guy listening, that's a friend.  You have a relationship.  Is that right, Dennis?  Exactly.  Exactly.  You're not talking to everybody out there in radio land.  And you're talking to that one person, one listener at a time.  You're going to talk to me, Dennis.  When I'm sitting there and I'm talking to Nicole about having sex on a beach while a  strange Mexican man watches her, I'm actually talking to her husband.  That was her father.  I didn't know, Nicole, you didn't tell me that.  No, it was not my father.  You guys haven't heard that one?  Watching or participating? 
[03:22:00]  He was the picture taker.  Oh, okay.  So it's not weird.  No.  It's all lies.  No.  He's towarded them to me.  Here's the weird part.  So Nicole comes on this show on Friday.  By the way, I have to compliment you on your sense of humor about everything.  Thank you very much.  But now we're going to test it.  It's nice to meet you.  Now we're going to test it because Nicole comes on this show.  She announces to the world that she's pregnant, right?  And she leaves the studio.  And right down the hall, 45 seconds after leaving the air, was Dennis Falcone the first 
[03:22:30]  person you talked to after you got off the air?  I believe he was the first person I spoke to.  Now, Nicole, I want you to tell me how the conversation went.  What was the first thing that Dennis said to you after you got off the air announcing  you were pregnant?  I need to first preface this by saying I believe it was out of love.  But he did tell me a story about a woman years and years ago who he didn't feel should  announce that she was pregnant on the air because when she did finally give birth, it  was dead.  What?  No, no.  It was a guy at work with.  What? 
[03:23:00]  It was a guy at work with.  Let me tell you the story.  This is a guy at work with, right?  Yeah.  And at the time, I was a program director at the station.  Let me give you the story.  Yeah.  And he said, hey, my wife is pregnant.  I said, well, make sure you don't talk about it on the air.  I said, why?  Now, you're telling Nicole this story immediately after announcing she's pregnant.  Immediately, I knew she was pregnant.  I said, congratulations to her.  But immediately after announcing on the air.  You were talking about it on the air.  Yeah.  So I said, whatever you do, don't talk about it on the air.  Why, why, why, why?  I said, well, just don't talk about it.  Just in case something, you know, it's like saying, hey, I'm getting married, getting  married.  And then all of a sudden, you're not getting married. 
[03:23:30]  And it's like, well, it's not a happy ending.  You're saying good times and great oldies.  And, you know, it's not a happy ending.  So you're a cup half full kind of guy, huh?  Exactly.  So I need something to mention the good times.  The good times and the great oldies.  Don't talk about it until the baby is born.  Then you say, hey, by the way, congratulations to my wife.  We just had a new member of the family.  Fine.  So you said, okay, fine.  Before we even know the ending of the story, Nicole's looking at you going, okay, well,  this advice doesn't help being that I just announced on the air. 
[03:24:00]  Okay, but go on.  And the conclusion of the story.  And you don't know if the program director of the radio station that she worked for wanted  her to announce that on the air.  I don't know if it was discussed.  Oh, yes, we do.  He did not.  It was discussed, and he gave me the go-ahead and told me to share it with the world.  And he was fearful for some reason.  Well, what's the conclusion of the story?  Well, they had a healthy baby.  Fantastic.  Oh, great.  So I left the station.  His wife is expecting another child.  Oh, beautiful.  Exactly.  Not beautiful until it's not good.  He's on the air talking about it every day.  Hey, my wife just did this.  My wife went there.  My wife went to the doctor. 
[03:24:30]  Because it's a process people can relate to.  It's beautiful.  It's nice.  Well, sad to say.  Sad to say what?  Sad to say the baby was what?  Stillborn.  Stillborn.  Yeah.  So it was not good times and good oldies.  My wife walked to the baby.  He just said stillborn.  He just said stillborn like a radio guy.  Hashtag stillborn.  You just said stillborn.  He could not play Be My Baby by the Ronettes.  You just said stillborn like it was the artist for this Two for Tuesday.  Stillborn coming at you.  I'm just telling you like it is, right? 
[03:25:00]  That's what you guys say?  Tell it like it is.  You're right, Danny.  I just did.  You're right, Danny.  But do you think that maybe there was some tact that could be used that most, like Nicole  is not.  You talked to her about having sex on a beach and her husband's here and you're talking  about me.  The baby was made face down, ass up.  That's the way she likes to fuck.  Now, but I have to.  You're talking tact?  I have to ask you, Danny.  You're not me, though.  No, of course not.  Okay?  No.  And I would think as a human being.  Yes.  Off the air, specifically.  Because there are things that I'll say on the air that, you know, once you get off the 
[03:25:30]  air, it's like, you're not entertaining people, Sam.  Like, you're just hurting me now.  That's right.  Like, you're just hurting me for your own enjoyment.  So you're Sam, different Sam off the air than you are on the air.  I mean, I try not to be as brutal off the air.  I try.  No, you're pretty brutal off the air.  Well, to you, maybe, because you do things like this, Dennis.  Because do you think that maybe...  Just talk to her for advice.  ...when a woman is pregnant...  The advice is, don't have a stillborn baby.  Yes.  Thank you.  We got it.  When a woman is pregnant, Nicole is not your typical girl, and that's fine.  But most women don't even want to hear the word stillborn. 
[03:26:00]  No.  Actually, you're the first person who said it to me.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate you for opening my eyes to child death.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Like...  No, it wasn't meant like that.  It was meant from the heart.  It was meant from the heart.  Like, I know, I know my wife, like, Nicole is somehow taking it with a grain of salt  and saying, no, he didn't mean anything.  But I know for a fact that if anybody said anything to that, like that to my wife, if  she was pregnant, she would be furious. 
[03:26:30]  But you're looking at...  She would come home screaming.  No, she would.  You're not looking at it...  Absolutely, she would.  You're not looking at it the way it was meant.  It was meant...  I'm surprised you were able to talk about it on the air, because that's what a program  director wants to tell me.  Do you know what happened?  Do you know how good that radio would be if the child, God forbid, was still born?  Oh, no, no.  Well, we would definitely bring it up here.  That would be big time news.  I'd give you a week.  We'd make TMZ, finally.  There wasn't any harm meant there.  I know there wasn't any harm meant.  No, I did not.  But you understand that it was a harmful statement to make.  Like, here's an example. 
[03:27:00]  It's like saying I could have gotten AIDS by making the baby having sex with Nicole.  What if you...  Like, why don't you bring up crib death?  Why don't you say, give it a year, because there's crib death.  You gotta take it to account.  No, no, that's ridiculous.  Oh, it is.  That doesn't happen.  That doesn't happen.  Yeah, that didn't happen to a co-worker.  It's crazy.  Plus, the thing is, also, there's a lot of guys out there who think she's still...  I wouldn't even announce that she was married, because she could still be that wild, bomb  She's not on porn radio.  Yeah, this is bullshit, Danny.  People like real human beings on the air.  That seems to be a thought around...  Back in the days of the WMCA good guys, all the disc jockeys were on the air. 
[03:27:30]  They were supposed to be these wild, single bachelors, so everybody just...  But it doesn't matter, because she's talking about being married and pregnant.  What do we talk about?  Getting jizzed on her belly.  Yeah, I would have rewound it.  I wouldn't even say, don't talk about being married.  Getting jizzed on her pregnant belly.  I did knock that off my bucket list.  See, and people like that type of talk, Dennis.  Yeah.  People like that.  She knows I compliment her every day.  Do you see how that's not a great statement to make?  No, I don't have a problem with it.  You still don't agree that that was not the right tack to take? 
[03:28:00]  No, I don't think there was anything wrong with it.  I don't see anything wrong with it either.  You don't, Matt.  I agree to disagree.  No, you think that bringing up the moment after a woman announces her pregnancy to the world,  because let's be honest, you're not sitting to the mashup, but you came on...  Am I supposed to say yes so I don't sound like an asshole?  But I think that stillborn jokes are hysterical.  He wasn't...  And he wasn't even joking, which makes it amazing.  It's reality radio, right, Sam?  It wasn't radio.  It was a hallway conversation between coworkers.  Jay-Z told Kanye that his baby could die dead. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Be born dead.  Hey, Kanye, I know you're a public guy and all, but just so you know, that baby could  be stillborn.  She'll still have that fat ass, but that baby could be stillborn.  Like, I don't think Kanye would have been like, you're right, Jay.  You're my dog.  I didn't think about that.  No.  He'd be like, why would you even bring it up?  Like, obviously, that's something everybody knows that that's a possibility, but we don't  talk about it because it's a very negative thing.  Listen, Sam's very, clearly very protective, which I love about him. 
[03:29:00]  So I'm really okay with it.  We can move on from it.  That's all right.  I understand where you can't.  I'm not only...  You can't.  Your husband can't.  Nicole can't.  Absolutely not.  I am furious.  I'm not so much...  Yeah, I'm protective, but at the same time, I'm also perplexed as to how this could happen.  This, to me, is not so much so I can reprimand you.  It's a study of human psychology.  It's a little fucking crazy.  I'm not going to lie.  Like, in what context would a person ever think that this was okay to do? 
[03:29:30]  It's just an unwritten rule in radio that you wouldn't talk about a lot of things like  that.  When you...  Just because of stillborn.  Well, I know.  No, I understand.  No, because of stillborn.  No, that's right, because that's the example you gave.  The only thing that could go wrong is stillborn.  That's the last thing.  Everything is great.  It has two hands, two feet.  Yeah, I mean, you waited the appropriate amount of time, correct?  Yeah, I mean, I'm five and a half months now.  You know the gender.  No risk.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  We're smooth sailing from here on out.  But she hasn't had a drink in two weeks.  Hours. 
[03:30:00]  Hours.  Drinking with Lady Di.  Hours.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's having that nanny ice to wake her up.  Nanny ice.  But it's just...  It's not something that you bring up in any context, I wouldn't think.  What were you going to say, Eric?  I was going to say, you said Denny, you know, could make it up to Nicole.  I think Denny should make it up to Nicole.  Yeah, he will.  You see that you believe...  You agree with me that it's totally out of line, right, Eric?  Very inappropriate.  Roland.  Roland's nodding.  It's crazy, is it not?  Yeah, like boofy.  Roland is the... 
[03:30:30]  He said like boofing.  I don't think this is the same thing as boofing.  But Roland is the king of being out of line.  Okay.  And he didn't make any comments about stillborn babies.  You guys are taking it totally wrong.  It wasn't meant like that.  Listen.  Is there something you'd like to say to Nicole?  I told her it wasn't meant like that.  You are a true scumbag in every sense of the word, Dennis.  You are the biggest scumbag that I've ever worked with.  Did you not say you're sorry?  It wasn't meant like that.  I did say I'm sorry.  You are worse than that Redskins guy who called Troy Aikman a queer and wouldn't apologize. 
[03:31:00]  No, no, no.  I wouldn't say that.  I said I'm sorry to him.  Well, I don't know for sure.  Did she interpret it that way?  But she's got a very tough skin.  Yes.  Hopefully that'll protect baby.  I told her she looks great every day.  She's glowing.  Look, nobody wants to hear you flirting with her in front of her husband.  It gets creepy by the second.  Why don't you guys just fall over here and have a dead kid in front of me?  The question is, would you like to apologize to Nicole?  I apologize to Nicole.  I hope you accept my apology.  It wasn't meant like that.  Would you like to apologize to her husband?  And to Mr. Nicole as well. 
[03:31:30]  Mr. Matt Baggins.  Uh-oh.  And would you like to apologize to little baby Samantha?  He wants me to name the baby Samantha.  It's beautiful.  La Samantha.  La Samantha.  Yeah, with an apostrophe.  Would you like to apologize to Samantha Biggins?  Congratulations to Samantha Biggins.  Welcome to the world.  Yes.  Thank you.  And hopefully she's not stillborn because you're going to...  No, because you'll seem like a real asshole talking to a stillborn kid as if it's a lie.  This won't be so funny in six months.  I know.  Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Biggins.  Thank you, Dennis Falcone.  I hope you've learned something.  These women, they're careful when they let the world know. 
[03:32:00]  I'm sick of it.  You've got to be careful with that shit.  I'm sick of it.  Fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  Goddamn...  Nicole, she was crowning before she told anybody that she's pregnant.  Nicole was obvious, though.  What?  We just got to look around a little more.  I was just looking at her feet every time she goes by.  It was pretty obvious.  Not her body changing.  It was just the glow.  The glow on her face.  The glow?  What?  It looked like she was...  I thought she was just doing coke.  No, that's what I noticed, that she was a bit on the sober side for a long period of 
[03:32:30]  time.  Ah.  Yeah.  You've got to pick up on the little clues around you.  Right.  She hadn't been soused.  No, and she didn't say, ah, fuck you, as she's walking through the halls and stuff.  Right, right.  She was pleasant.  It's working for her because she's not coming in hungover.  It's not destroying her body.  Right.  She didn't give us the finger going by the glass.  All that fun stuff we get to enjoy with her.  Did you hear what Dennis said to her after she announced she was pregnant on the air?  Horrible. 
[03:33:00]  He said that...  He said...  The minute that she got off the air, he said, congratulations.  You know, a lot of people don't like to announce their pregnancies on the air.  I had a co-worker of mine who I told him not to announce that his wife was pregnant  on the air, but he did, and the baby was fine.  But then he did it again, and his second baby was stillborn.  Right after she announced this.  He did not say this.  Yes.  I swear to God.  So...  He did.  Immediately after...  So that means he's on the spectrum.  He's gotta be. 
[03:33:30]  He's on the spectrum, we call it.  And then he came in on the after show...  You gotta be careful.  You just say he's on the spectrum.  He came in on the after show and said, oh, no, I didn't mean anything by it.  I was just telling a story.  I was just saying that's just something...  You don't mention that to somebody who's pregnant.  No.  Oh, it doesn't...  All right, you didn't mean anything by it, but it just shows you're stupid.  You don't even say that word to a pregnant woman.  Hell no.  No.  Jesus.  I think Denny does a good job on the show.  You do?  He does real quality radio broadcasting.  He gets a little out of hand. 
[03:34:00]  Denny does?  I don't think he's got all those feelers out there.  Feeling what people should, shouldn't say, shouldn't hear, things like that.  He's a boob.  He's a boob.  His social graces are out of whack.  A little out of whack, yeah.  Because he might be on the spectrum.  Yeah.  He better come in here and defend himself now.  I gotta know if he's on the spectrum.  I do feel bad I didn't invite him to the party, though.  But you said you invite everybody.  I do.  You did say that.  But apparently he needs a personal invitation.  Well, he's on the spectrum, you know.  No, he doesn't really pick up on social cues. 
[03:34:30]  Well, we don't know if he's officially on the spectrum.  What does that mean on the spectrum?  Eh, it might be a little, you know.  You know.  Is he slow?  No, just tough with social cues.  Right.  I think that's how they judge autism.  By a spectrum, right?  Yeah, because there's many parts of the spectrum.  Right, right.  And the spectrum's been broadened recently, by the way.  Dennis Falcone, it's very easy.  We don't need a long, drawn-out appearance from you today.  Denny, what about your insensitive remarks to Nicole?  Right.  We already covered that on the after show.  Well, that's the after show.  The after show is the after show. 
[03:35:00]  This is the main show.  Let's do it for an audience.  No, no.  First of all, it wasn't insensitive.  What?  Oh, it was completely insensitive.  A woman that's pregnant doesn't want to hear anything about stillborn.  No, no, no.  She doesn't want to hear the word stillborn.  She doesn't want to hear the word miscarriage.  She doesn't want to hear the word crib death.  She doesn't want to hear the word what does it?  There are certain things you just never say.  Doesn't want to hear the retarded.  Right.  Any of that shit.  Yeah, she doesn't want to hear that baby's a mongrel.  She doesn't want to hear things like chipper love doesn't matter what color people are. 
[03:35:30]  We didn't say anything like that.  You did?  I just said from a programming standpoint.  I worked at a radio station once and a disc jockey's wife was pregnant.  He said, I can't wait to go on the air and talk about it.  He said, no, you can't.  He goes, why not?  I said, well, you just can't.  I go, there's, what if there's complications?  What if there's a problem?  And you're saying, hey, good times and great oldies.  And by the way, my wife lost the baby.  So I just told Nicole, it's better not to have said anything than just all of a sudden,  where's Nicole?  She comes back and I've got a new member of the family.  And he said this to her immediately after she had just said something on the air. 
[03:36:00]  And it's that dumb advice that it's too late because you already did it anyway.  Right.  So who are you helping?  You're only hurting her.  It was conversational.  It wasn't.  It was immediately after she got on.  But it's also bad radio to not be truthful with your audience.  100%.  Well, that's a different type of radio.  Yeah, it's terrible radio.  But what were you trying to accomplish?  Because she already told her audience that she was pregnant.  It was just conversational in passing.  I meant to tell her, don't do it again.  But I did offer to have, I offered to be the DJ for her christening celebration.  Well, that's if the kid makes it. 
[03:36:30]  But Dennis, you think it's acceptable to have that casual conversation with a woman that's  pregnant?  We're just speaking.  Because there's so many things that could still happen with a pregnancy.  You just never bring any bad things up.  It was just reality.  No, you don't bring any of that up.  No.  Because she's not going to think, she's not going to walk away from that conversation  with the thought like, well, maybe I shouldn't say it on the air.  Like the radio portion of it that was so important to you when you conveyed the story is not what  she walked away with.  She walked away from that conversation with, oh my God. 
[03:37:00]  There are things out there, there are horrible things out there that can happen to a child.  Here's what you said to her.  You know, you might not have wanted to announce that because the kid might not live.  And that would be a bummer to have to tell your audience.  Right.  That's in an ugly way of paraphrasing the message you gave her.  It is that exact.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I don't think so.  That again, it's strictly an opinion.  But how could it be?  It's strictly, get the women on the phone.  It's the spectrum.  The four that listen to us.  How could it be different, the opinion?  You said to her, you gave the example because you wanted Nicole to relate to the example. 
[03:37:30]  And you basically said, you shouldn't have announced that because if the kid doesn't  make it, you'll have to give a sad announcement.  Why would you say you should not have announced that?  Why would you say that?  I was just, we were talking about it in passing.  Oh.  I said, you know, I worked at a radio station where-  So why would you bring that example up if you weren't relating it to her?  You don't say that to pregnant women ever.  Maybe, you know, this kid, you know, she has this kid and then she's not pregnant anymore.  You want to have that small talk?  Because he considers it just a little small talk. 
[03:38:00]  Just some light fighting.  Absolutely not when they're pregnant.  So much shit could go wrong still, right up until the birth of the damn thing.  And that story directly relates to her.  You're telling a story of somebody who announced it on the air right after she just announced  hers on the air.  Oh, Jenny.  Of course you are.  It's the direct correlation to this is you and what could happen.  You just never mention those horrible things.  If you just mention that for no reason, that's one thing.  But she said she was pregnant and you were saying why you advised someone not to say they 
[03:38:30]  were pregnant, which is your way of saying you probably shouldn't have said that because  of this.  And then you're on hits one, you'll have to make a sad announcement.  That was the same thing.  Right.  Grim Reaper over there.  Okay.  If you look at it that way, then there's no other way to look at it.  How do you look at it that way?  I don't think I did anything wrong.  He's missing some social cues.  All right.  Spectrum.  Are you on the spectrum?  No.  Okay.  No.  I just learned something about Dennis.  He's like, yeah.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You just don't see this.  No, no, no.  I love Nicole.  It wasn't meant to hurt her. 
[03:39:00]  No, she's pregnant.  You're talking about stillborn.  We don't think it was meant to hurt her.  No, of course not.  It wasn't malicious.  It was dumb.  I'm looking at it from a radio standpoint.  But you won't take responsibility for the fact that you unintentionally did that.  But you're talking from a radio standpoint.  Unintentionally, if you're looking at it that way, yes.  No, you keep saying if you're looking.  There's no other way to look at it.  But he's saying it was from a radio standpoint.  But in Nicole's eyes, it was, no, real.  From a radio standpoint, you don't have a conversation, period.  You don't bring up these things when you see a pregnant girl. 
[03:39:30]  Well, that's true.  We all think it, but we don't say shit.  I don't think you had any malice.  No, no malice.  I don't think you meant to do that.  I just think that how you are, you assumed that this was a wonderful story to tell her.  When meanwhile, and I don't know if you see it right now, it was a terrible thing to say.  No, like, for instance, say if Sam said, hey, he came in and he said, hey, my wife is pregnant.  We'd say, who is this?  That's what I was saying.  And I would just jokingly say, I would tell him, hey, look, make sure you don't talk about it in the air, 
[03:40:00]  because I worked at a radio station.  But she already said it on the air.  So you're not even helping her.  You're just putting the thought of stillborn in her head.  It was just a war story.  It was just a radio war story.  It was just a war story that ends with a dead child.  Jessica, thank you.  Let's go to Rachel.  Rachel.  Rachel.  Hey, good morning.  Hi, Rach.  I love a thing you often don't mention to a pregnant woman is, gee, how are you going to lose all that baby weight you put on?  Right.  How is this thing?  I had a friend who got big and fat after she got pregnant.  Yeah, exactly.  The husband wound up leaving her because she was so big and fat. 
[03:40:30]  And the baby died, so she really lost on all fronts.  And now fat-bottom girls.  Right.  Right here on.  It's queen.  It's queen.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no, no.  If you look at it that way.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  We have two sides to every story.  Right.  It's not in this case.  A little water cooler chat for you.  Yeah.  We understand that.  But the two sides of this.  You said something to her and you explained why you said it.  Nobody thinks it was dumb with Malice.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:41:00]  Nobody thinks it was evil.  Well, I don't think it was dumb with Malice.  But it was absolutely dumb.  Make sure when you bathe the children early on, you have somebody in there with you because  of postpartum depression, some mothers drown their children.  Well, I tell you what.  Have a good day.  I will never relay that story again to any pregnant patient.  You learned something today here on the Opinion Anthony Show.  I did.  That's what we aim to do here.  You should make sure you tell Sway, don't mention that you're black because there's been  racial lynchings in the country.  You know, and go to OutQ and tell them about all the gay bashing.  They shouldn't mention that they're gay.  You guys hear about a young man named Matthew Shepard? 
[03:41:30]  Yes, yes.  He was a gay man who was beaten to death for his gayness.  And it's even worse than it's a radio story.  Knock them dead in there.  Yeah.  I have learned something here in Nice-vember.  Oh.  Nice-vember.  Yeah.  We're doing nice things here in November for people.  Nice-vember.  What have you learned?  I will not say that again to a pregnant woman because I don't need to upset you guys.  Just to make sure I wouldn't know.  See, but he still makes it look like it's irrational on our part.  Instead of just admitting he can't admit that he's wrong.  No.  He can't admit that he's wrong.  He was just relaying a story.  We understand that.  He was just relaying a story.  I know, but it failed miserably. 
[03:42:00]  I talked to Jess to make sure I wasn't being oversensitive or just picking on you.  Uh-huh.  She was horrified.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Of course.  Everyone's telling you the same thing.  Of course.  And you're making it look like it's our hang-up.  No, no, it's not a hang-up.  You said you wouldn't do it again because it upsets us.  No, no, no.  Not because it's a bad thing to do.  Okay, do you want me to admit?  I was wrong.  Oh, wow.  He doesn't mean it.  No, no, I do mean it.  Of course I do.  No, I do.  Because, you know what?  Maybe I didn't think of the repercussions of it. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, of course.  Well, yeah.  There you go.  Women are very sensitive.  But I did offer her my services for a christening party, but then she told me she was Jewish and she doesn't have a christening party.  So she has no desire to be around you.  Yeah, no, after that, I mean.  It's going to be a girl, right?  Yes.  So we're good here?  That's true.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey, by the way, Jimmy, I was thinking of you on Saturday when I brought the.  Why?  Because for me, the comedian killed himself.  When I introduced the bride and groom, they walked in a crazy train.  How cool was that?  Oh, wow.  Cool.  But you know, I must have made your name. 
[03:43:00]  They probably should have, though, because Randy Rhodes did die in a car crash.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  I said, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we're all here, and then you hit the Aussie and you're  All aboard!  And be careful with those crossings.  Five teens died in a van going over one of these railroad crossings.  I did learn something, too.  Okay, good.  I did learn something, and I do beg of your forgiveness.  We honestly really don't care, but we figured we'd make a break of it.  Sure.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's Worst of 2013. 
[03:43:30]  On the O.P. and Anthony channel.  O.P. and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  Continues right now.  We are down to our final segment for today's Worst of 2013 for the O.P. and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock, and what a way to end today's show by, again, calling up our good friend  for everything radio, Dennis Falcone.  This is the time you just heard all the stuff that he went through with Nicole and her pregnancy. 
[03:44:00]  Now, this time, we discuss his behavior at the company's holiday gathering and his comments  towards this girl, Lauren, who works on the Cousin Brucie show.  All of these events were witnessed by Sam, myself, Tommy from Hits One, Liam from the Talent  Department, and many others here at SiriusXM.  Here's Denny getting a little rowdy, working a little blue at the holiday gathering.  ONA's Worst of 2013.  What else happened at the party?  Well, I mean, yeah, you talk about drinking.  Right.  Apparently, Dennis Falcone, he didn't overdo it with the drinks. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, our own Denny Falcone was at the party.  But Dennis Falcone, he waited all day.  He's talking about the party.  He wore.  Is he here yet?  He is.  Oh, I see that weird walk of his.  He wore.  He's walking down the hall.  They had Santa Claus do a town hall here for the Kids Channel.  Yeah.  Dennis Falcone got a laminate, because they give laminates to all the people who go to  them in the audience.  Uh-huh.  He got a laminate, and he wore the laminate all day yesterday.  He wore the laminate.  Just to celebrate Christmas. 
[03:45:00]  Like, that was a week ago when Santa was here.  He was feeling special.  He was feeling special.  Right.  Like, look, they gave me a laminate for the Santa Claus interview.  And nobody gave me a laminate for the Santa Claus interview.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Is he almost here?  But he shows up to this thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he had, like, three beers.  Three beers?  Right.  Look out.  And all of a sudden, he's his whole other guy.  Uh-oh.  Really?  Like, I mean, he was inappropriate.  What? 
[03:45:30]  Wow.  Dennis was inappropriate last night.  He was an inappropriate guy at the office party.  Wait, you have no problem going on record in saying this.  I found him to be inappropriate.  Wow.  Why?  Whoa.  That's right.  I'm not issuing a complaint.  Here he comes.  But I thought his behavior was inappropriate, and I worried that some of the female employees  at this company, beautiful female employees at this company, may be offended by this.  Do you have any examples?  Yes, I do.  Let me hear.  You want to hear it before he gets in?  Yes, yes.  He announced, yelled out with everybody around him, who's got mistletoe on their belt buckle? 
[03:46:00]  Oh, no.  He actually said that.  And just a sea of employees, bosses, HR officials.  He was that guy.  No, he got it wrong.  Uh-oh.  Eric's very excited.  He rocks.  He yells out, am I the only guy with mistletoe on my belt buckle?  That's even worse.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  What happens at office Christmas parties?  You want to hear another one?  People lose their minds.  He put a lampshade on his head and danced around? 
[03:46:30]  What is this, from fucking Mad Men?  There's this girl, Lauren.  She's this young 20-something blonde that works for the Cousin Brucie show.  Uh-huh.  And this is her first Christmas party here at this company.  It's like a dream come true, right?  Oh, must have seen.  She loves this job still, and that'll go away.  Give it time.  She loves this job still.  Don't worry.  Give it time.  And is just having the time of her life.  Until Dennis Falcone asks her, hey, Lauren, how long till you hop up on that photocopier 
[03:47:00]  and make a photocopy of your ass?  Oh, you can't say that.  Yes.  For real?  Yes.  That's true.  Then.  Oh, no.  There's some other chick who's walking by him.  I don't even know who this chick is.  I don't know her name, so I don't want to.  Travis Teft?  It could have been Travis.  She wasn't here yesterday.  Oh, wow.  And she had the same figure, though.  Oh, a little waif-like.  And he goes, hey, honey, how about a kiss? 
[03:47:30]  Hey, honey, how about...  Does he think it's 1950?  I don't know.  Three beers in.  Oh, God.  It's not like he wasn't stumbling around.  He's living mad men.  He is living mad men.  He was.  Nothing wrong with that.  He was Don Draper with a pedophile mustache.  Oh, my goodness.  It doesn't help.  That mustache certainly doesn't help.  No.  The creep factor.  And he was like, immediately...  That's great.  Like, me and E-Rock, who was also at the party, and Liam, the talent booker, we were  all like, Dennis, what the fuck are you doing? 
[03:48:00]  Chill.  Like, what are you doing?  That's crazy inappropriate.  And Dennis went on his, you know, spectrum arguments.  Oh, no, no.  Where, exactly.  Where, instead of...  Oh, I forgot.  He's very inappropriate.  Acknowledging.  He doesn't understand that he's being inappropriate.  Right.  Instead of acknowledging and correcting his behavior...  Uh-huh.  He'll just deny...  He denied.  He justified.  We're at a party!  And alcohol is being supplied!  We're off work hours!  Wow, he really justified it. 
[03:48:30]  It was crazy.  Yeah, at one point, word was going around that the beer was starting to run out.  Uh-oh.  And he was already, like Sam said, three beers in, and he disappears.  Comes back later, and he's double fisting.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  He's got to take one for the road.  Jesus.  Just in case everything ran out.  Yeah.  But, like, I mean, he wasn't the drunkest dude there.  It's not like the drinking was the part that was the problem so much as...  He's just got that in him.  Right.  Like, after...  Within the constraints... 
[03:49:00]  Within the constraints of employment, he will adhere to all rules and regulations.  Right.  But, if he can justify that it's a party, it's off hours, they supplied the booze, then the  real Danny comes out, who is the guy that says, hey, toots, you know...  Jump up on that photocopier.  Jump up on the photocopy machine.  Let me see that ass.  Well, people on the spectrum tend to not have a filter.  Yes.  Well, Hopi, you may not know this, but it's a social disorder. 
[03:49:30]  Or any self-accountability or anything.  Let's bring him in for a second.  One of my favorite parts, in our lobby, there's a staircase that goes from our floor to the  37th floor.  He's at the top of the floor, he claps his hands and yells out to the party, hey, let's  go to the strip club.  And then starts walking down the stairs with a strut.  He was really making a scene.  He might as well have been walking around with mirrors on his shoes.  Right, right.  Shoe mirrors trying to look up girls' skirts.  I'm starting to understand why he doesn't have a full-time gig on air. 
[03:50:00]  Wow.  I'm finally getting it.  You get three beers in him, just enough to loosen him up to be his true self.  Well, here he comes to defend himself.  Oh, yes.  Lovely and talented.  Denny.  Hey, Denny!  Who's going to the strip club?  What?  It's a strip club.  What'd you say?  Remember at the end of Caddyshack when Dangerfield says, hey, everyone, we're all going to get  laid.  So I go, hey, everybody, we're going for lap dances.  It was just something funny.  That's what I was doing last night.  But you don't work blue. 
[03:50:30]  Obviously, he's not blue.  He doesn't work blue on the air, but he works blue around the office.  In life.  He always is fun.  Right.  At the office party, he certainly works blue.  And the office party was mainly populated by the people who do not get to have fun at  this job.  Like the people who work downstairs that we never see.  They're not on-air people.  They're cubicle people.  They're bean counters and whatnot.  And the people, I mean, the behind-the-scenes folks.  Behind-the-scenes folks.  And narcs.  And narcs.  They'll say something.  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  Because they've been told they can't put pictures of their children in their cubicle.  Right.  Because it offends the women that can't have children.  But apparently this guy can get everybody lap dances.  Uh-huh.  Denny, I'm hearing you were out of control.  No.  We just had a few beers.  You had mistletoe on your belt buckle.  No.  We had three beers.  It's funny.  People posting pictures saying, Denny, six beers.  Next picture.  Denny, five beers.  I had three beers.  Yeah.  I told them it wasn't-  Two Blue Moons and a Sam Adams.  What about asking the girl to get on the copy machine?  Oh, Lauren.  I said, what are you doing?  She's standing by the copy machine eating cupcakes. 
[03:51:30]  She was like inhaling those things.  I said, hey, be careful to the copy machine.  What, are you going to jump up and take pictures?  No, you don't want to do that.  That's not the fuck what she said.  You don't want to do that.  See, that's just it, Denny.  That's not what you said.  You can't say that.  No one blows my mind.  We have done just vile, disgusting, shock jockery in our careers, and we know you just  can't do stuff like that.  But you know what?  I'm doing it.  I'm channeling Dangerfield.  Just doing funny stuff.  Oh, yeah.  That's all I'm doing.  He uses character.  Exactly. 
[03:52:00]  I'm doing it in character.  Denny uses character.  I'm the last guy in the world.  He uses character.  Or keep talking while we're trying to do a little bit, but that's okay.  You've got to use characters.  Let me just get my point across.  That's why I grew that prior mustache.  Just have it fun.  I'm just doing lines from Rickles and goofy stuff.  Just have it a good time.  Give me a Rickles line.  It's a party.  I love Don Rickles.  I'm a big fan.  21-year-old fucking girl will understand that you're doing Rickles.  Yeah, of course.  But she, you know what?  Give me a Rickles.  I'm just saying, if it was something Rickles might sit, I don't know. 
[03:52:30]  Well, you're lucky, yeah.  No, no, no.  She wasn't laughing like, good one, Denny.  She was turning around to me and to E-Rock.  Making faces like, uh-oh.  And going like, like laughing at, can you believe what's happening?  He asked me to make a photocopy of my butt.  Wow.  No, no.  I didn't say it in those words.  She said that you said butt.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  No, no.  She said that.  She doesn't lie.  Wow.  She doesn't lie.  Okay, so, we're just having a good time.  She didn't have a good time.  We're just having a good time. 
[03:53:00]  That's all it was.  Good time indeed.  That's all it is.  And there were people from Hits 1 that were sitting there watching like, what the fuck is  Denny doing?  Hey, who was there from Hits 1?  The new guy you guys don't know.  Not the girls.  No?  None of the girls showed up.  None of the girls showed up.  No.  And Rich Davis was there.  Nicole ain't showing up if she can't drink with that kid in her gut.  Exactly.  She can't be around it.  I don't know.  They ran out of beer pretty fast.  Well, with guys like you, darn double fisting like that.  You know I was.  Jeez, let some people near the beer, Denny. 
[03:53:30]  I'm here this early in the morning.  I'm sure they calculated the...  Functional alcoholic.  I'm sure they calculated the beer perfectly.  We're like, okay, if we have this much beer...  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They brought more in.  It's very likely that no one will be too buzzed.  Yeah.  But that to me is more disturbing.  Because like I said, Dennis, he's right.  He was not drunk.  No.  He wasn't stumbling around.  He wasn't...  He was just a little buzzed and got some truth serum in him.  That's all it takes.  And all of a sudden he's asking girls who walk by him for a kiss. 
[03:54:00]  No, I'm not.  You didn't say, hey, let's have a kiss.  No, of course not.  Four different people told me that separately.  Oh, shit.  No, of course not.  Then what happened?  I was standing by the tater tots.  And I said, you remember the movie Napoleon Dynamite when he stuffs the tater tot in his pocket?  Yes.  And the guy's in the classroom saying, let me have some of your tots.  Napoleon goes, no.  And he smashes them.  So we were just laughing about the tater tots.  I think they were warm.  I'm talking about a different instance, obviously.  But nothing about a kiss?  No, of course not.  You know what?  The tater tots goes back to Roland's point that the food might have not been up to par. 
[03:54:30]  Look, people are just hanging out.  You can't have tater tots at a party.  People love tater tots, though.  One young lady walked by.  Huh?  One young lady walked by.  You know what?  Tater tots do.  Came over and gave me a kiss.  That's all.  Oh.  That's all.  On your belt buckle?  No.  On my cheek.  And then what did you say?  Nothing.  Did your helmet start getting hard?  I think she likes me.  Did you then solicit any other girls for a kiss?  Did you start filling up?  No, of course not.  Did you say, hey, the line.  I know where to draw the line.  I know where to draw the line.  Did you say, hey, the line starts here, ladies. 
[03:55:00]  Did you have a penis vein popping out?  No.  No.  His version of the story is not true.  No.  I don't know.  He asked a girl for a kiss.  Who did I ask for a kiss?  I don't know her name, and I'm not going to implicate her.  No.  Exactly.  We're on the air.  No, you don't have facts.  Are you on the prowl?  No.  Are you single, man?  You guys don't have the facts here.  Single and ready to mingle?  No.  You guys don't have the facts.  You guys are just trying to get me in trouble.  You didn't say, am I the only one with mistletoe on my belt buckle?  I didn't have mistletoe on my belt buckle.  But did you say that? 
[03:55:30]  I said there was a guy I worked with who would walk around at Christmas parties,  office parties, holiday parties.  He didn't do this whole set up.  Yes, I did.  I said it.  He said, hey, I've got a mistletoe belt buckle.  And that was just a goofy thing.  No.  You yelled out.  Sam Roberts is definitely saying you're full of shit.  You yelled out, am I the only one?  He's there writing notes down at a party.  I don't need to write notes.  I've got a fucking steel trap up.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Steel trap.  Steel trap.  No.  No.  No.  We were just having fun.  It was good, clean fun.  You said, am I the only one with mistletoe on his belt buckle?  How many times have you been hauled into HR for sexual harassment charges? 
[03:56:00]  Never because I don't mean it.  Because we're just having a couple of laughs.  Dennis, that implies that you're waiting for somebody to at least kiss the tip.  No.  That's what that implies.  You know who else thought it was just fun and games?  The mayor of San Diego.  Just having some fun.  What's the matter?  Just a few headlocks.  Just a few headlocks and I'll drag you around the office, squeeze a tit.  How much pre-cum was dripping in your underpants as you were harassing the ladies at the winter 
[03:56:30]  gathering?  Any comment?  Any pre-cum?  How much pre-cum?  None.  I don't know.  I was just having a couple of laughs.  Were you spotting?  No.  Were you spotting with pre-cum?  Oh, man.  He was sitting there offering drinks to girls the whole time nobody would accept, thank  God.  No.  How bad did you want one of these young ladies to squeeze your balls?  That's nice.  I'm doing jokes because you guys are just laughing and ripping on me all the time.  That's what these guys do all day.  Just laughing.  Roland walks around with a megaphone all day yelling at me.  Yeah, but he's not sexually harassing people. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, shit.  He knows where the line is.  He walked by my desk yesterday and broke wind.  He did.  That's not sexual harassment.  Oh, God.  That's harassing me.  That could be some type of sexual harassment.  That's harassment.  The security lady who works in her office is right next to Denny's.  I think they put him there because of all the harassment complaints.  No, there was no harassment complaints.  She was so pissed at Roland because she walked into her office and smelled Roland gas.  Oh, my God.  Really?  She starts going, pew, pew.  And she's like this Jamaican or Caribbean lady.  She called him the most disgusting man.  That's disgusting. 
[03:57:30]  She said, you got the nastiest ass in the building.  Oh, wow.  He throws football and knocks hot tea all over me.  I don't keep complaining.  No, nothing's going on back there.  It's just fun.  What the fuck is going on?  No surprise that nothing gets done around here.  Roland desperately needs control in his life.  That's no secret.  Yeah, well, we know that.  But nothing that Roland does was worse than Denny asking girls who are in their 20s who  have worked here for less than a year to jump up on the photocopy machine.  It wasn't girls. 
[03:58:00]  No, it wasn't girls.  It was that ad girls.  It's like the Nuremberg hearings here.  I didn't do anything wrong.  Is she around today?  No.  I want to get her side of this.  She may be.  Maybe she can call in or something.  Yeah, let's have her call in, please.  I want to hear this.  No, it was just fun.  Good clean fun.  Good clean fun.  Did you enjoy the ping pong match?  Yeah, I'm not really a big ping pong fan.  Well, who is?  Really, when you think about it.  But knowing that guy, he probably set up cameras to make sure everyone was watching him play  ping pong.  So you're in trouble if you weren't watching the big match and make him believe he cared 
[03:58:30]  about it.  I was upstairs by the cupcakes and just having a...  Oh, that's what he called the girls?  That's such a madman thing.  I know, right?  Come here, cupcake.  Call the office workers cupcakes.  Yeah.  Hey, cupcake, come here.  You do?  You like that show, Mad Men?  I've really never got into it.  How many fannies have you pinched around here in your tenure?  Fannies?  You ever smack a girl's fanny as she walked by?  No, of course not.  You don't put your hands on anyone. 
[03:59:00]  You call her toots?  How many girls did you force to sit on your lap as you're programming the holiday channel?  None.  Ask for suggestions from the girls.  Come here, sit on my lap and give me a 60s song.  You know what's very telling about Denny's sense of humor?  We had, in diversity training, this is true, Denny.  In diversity training, everybody has to go.  Uh-huh.  And I heard at Denny's session.  He heard.  Yeah.  And then you tell me if this is not true.  Uh-huh.  That there was something about sexually harassing female co-workers. 
[03:59:30]  And Denny raised his hand.  No, it wasn't sexually harassing.  Okay, tell me what the context was.  It was, it wasn't, it was like, you can't have them do something.  I don't know.  Okay, but it was.  We were talking about.  It was the way you treat female co-workers.  Okay.  And Denny raised his hand.  All co-workers.  And said, hey, does this also apply to interns?  It was just a joke.  It was just a goofy lie.  You were just in the middle of diversity training.  But he doesn't work.  Denny loves the joke.  Why wouldn't you say this for the air?  Then you wouldn't be a shitty fucking part-time weekend jock.  You got good material. 
[04:00:00]  You just got to start working blue, Denny.  No semblance of context.  None.  That's fantastic.  You know what?  I wouldn't hurt a soul in the world, and they know that.  Because I'm just a mean, I'm just a fun guy.  As long as they keep their ass on that photocopier, you know he's getting hurt, ladies.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Words hurt, Denny.  That's what you got to understand.  Oh, come on.  You guys hurt me all day long.  We do.  Sal calls me old man.  Pops.  Pops.  Well, fuck.  Who calls anyone Pops?  I don't run to HR.  He's calling me old man.  To be fair, you're quite a bit older than Sal. 
[04:00:30]  Okay, fine.  But, you know.  You could be his grandfather.  You know that.  Easily.  Easily, right?  Easily.  We're just having a couple of laughs at the holiday gathering.  It was you laughing.  Sounds like a pisser.  Laughing in disbelief.  Not at like, oh, Denny's a riot.  It was like, holy shit.  Where did this guy come from?  No.  All right, Denny.  It sounds like everyone had a great time, though.  The guy that doesn't work blue on the radio is the most outrageous person around here.  He was by far the most outrageous person.  When the mics are off.  I bet they thought you were a shock jock. 
[04:01:00]  I bet people were like, what station is he on?  What channel is he on?  He's a shock jock.  Do we have a shock jock channel around here?  This is shock jockery.  Eric, do you think Denny was the most outrageous person at the party?  Yeah.  By far, right?  By far.  By far.  Everybody was having a great time, too.  It wasn't like everybody was like, oh, I got to watch what I say.  Everybody was just having a good time.  Chilling out and enjoying each other's company.  We're just loosening up.  We're just loosening up.  Loosening up.  Get up on the copy machine.  Look, there's a...  I also heard, and this is hearsay, so... 
[04:01:30]  Denny may or may not have walked up to Sway.  Uh-oh.  Dropping the M-bombs?  Well, he might as well.  Of course not.  He may or may not have walked up to Sway and said, hey, I love you on Hip Hop Nation.  Aren't you Ed Lover?  I did not say that.  That is false.  They all look alike.  Right, Denny?  That's the joke, isn't it?  No.  What did you do then?  No.  I didn't go up to Sway and say that to him.  I said, did you throw the game?  I said, that's...  Eric, what's the story then? 
[04:02:00]  Because Eric is the one who told me that.  You rock comment.  He came up.  He was upstairs again.  I said Fab Five Freddy.  He said this in front of myself.  Roland hits one people.  And he goes, sometimes I'll go up to black guys and say, hey, are you Ed Lover?  I love you on Backspin.  No, I did not say black guys.  That's a funny joke, though.  Get Roland in here.  That was a good one.  I would not do that.  But not at the party, Dennis.  Wow. 
[04:02:30]  Everybody's just trying to have a good time.  No, they're just ripping on me because that's what they do.  Let's rip on Denny.  Your natural ability is to work blue.  I don't know what you're ready for.  I know.  You should just embrace it.  It's supposed to be a judgment-free zone at the party.  That's why it's not a Christmas party.  Right.  That's what I'm talking about.  A couple of laughs.  Look at that juice.  Some juice in there.  Some juice walking down the hall.  You like that, Denny?  I didn't see it, Denny.  Tell her to hop up on a photocopier.  I'll take something home with you.  There'd be a lot of toner in that photocopier.  He saw, but he's back to workplace. 
[04:03:00]  Work hours, Denny.  You put the mistletoe back in the drawer.  Let's make believe the winter gathering is still happening, and he'd have a lot to say  about that ass that we just saw.  No, I didn't.  Roland, what do you got to add to the Denny thing?  I don't know.  He's had a great time.  He cracked me up.  Hey, honey, you want a kiss on the lips?  Not those lips.  No, I didn't.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be entertaining to listen to Dennis Falcone be outrageous.  Of course it would.  But I'm very surprised by this.  Hilarious.  He's told us many times he doesn't work blue on the radio. 
[04:03:30]  And the context is so off.  I didn't say any foul language right now.  We should have a Dennis Falcone tequila and donut day.  He participated in tequila and donut day.  Yes, he did.  He is a trooper.  He's done everything we've asked except for a curse on the radio.  I don't like to do that.  He's got that, but you're right, he doesn't curse, but he's got that old school mentality  of, yes, women are there to be harassed.  No, they're not there to be harassed.  Not cursing is saying like, oh, I make sure I don't get a speeding ticket, but you're a  serial killer. 
[04:04:00]  Right.  Like, it doesn't matter.  All right, we got Lauren on line one.  This is one of the many girls you harassed yesterday at the Winter Gathering.  It's not many girls.  Good morning, Lauren.  How are you?  Hey, good morning.  You okay, Lauren, this morning?  I know you were a little shaky last night after your interaction with Dennis.  I got over it.  I'm okay.  I slept it off.  Now, without like, you know, doing like fake radio crap, what did he say to you exactly?  Okay, we were all sitting upstairs by the cupcake area, and he was like four beers in at this  time.  Four beers.  And out of nowhere, he turns to me and he says, hey, Lauren, we're going to get up on 
[04:04:30]  that copier and make a copy of that ass.  I did not say, I didn't say, I did not say that.  It's even worse.  No, no.  It's even worse.  Lauren, I did not say that word.  I said the, I might have said, but maybe.  Okay, now the story's already changing, because he said before he didn't say, but.  Right.  Right.  You're like in denial mode, because for the last two hours last night, you were going  around to everybody, and you were saying, I didn't do that.  And then the number of beers that you drank went down from five to three to two. 
[04:05:00]  It went down from three, it was three beers.  People saw you with three, and I saw a photo of you double fisting.  So somebody came up and said, here, take a picture.  Okay.  It was all, take a picture.  It was all goofy stuff.  Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you, right?  I love that.  Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you.  Lauren, you know that we're just having fun, right?  On the record, Lauren.  On the record.  You never want to have to say, Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you.  I wouldn't hurt you.  This is meant to be.  I'm not hurting you.  I was a great guy, and it was all fun last night.  Oh, of course. 
[04:05:30]  Lauren, I need you to walk down to the lobby with me.  Iraq, comment.  Right after this incident happened was when Denny was drinking his beer, leaning on that  little part of the wall.  And Lauren, did he not say when this girl walked past, kiss, kiss, how about a kiss?  Well, this is what happened.  After he said that comment to me, that's what started off everything.  Oh, yeah.  And as girls, these are girls that we don't work with.  They're different from 36th floor.  These are people that are, like, you know, stuffier business suit type on the 37th floor.  And as these girls were passing, he was saying all these comments, like, hey, baby, how 
[04:06:00]  about a kiss?  I don't know if I'm saying that.  I don't.  I didn't say that.  Oh, boy.  What happens?  Does he black out after a couple beers?  No, I didn't do anything.  Why is the story so different?  One beer is a blackout for Denny.  Yes.  I would have to believe my guys and Lauren over you.  Okay, fuck.  There's too many stories coming.  No, I said, how about a cupcake?  How about a cup?  We were giving out cupcakes to everybody.  Remember all the cupcakes there?  You don't blame the victim.  You don't call the victim a liar.  She's not the victim. 
[04:06:30]  She was a victim.  She got asked.  She's one of the cupcakes.  Why?  She was asking for it because of how she was dressed?  No, of course not.  No, no.  Are you one of those guys?  No, no, not at all.  She didn't realize she wanted to get dead ass on top of the coffee machine.  Not at all.  Just joking around.  Just having a few laughs.  Just having some fun.  Nobody got hurt.  No one got hurt.  They're going to implement the Dennis Falcone rule.  Oh, Jesus.  The Dennis Falcone rule.  It's in the handbook.  A new edition.  It's going to be in the handbook next year.  Addendum.  It was just fun.  By the way, Dennis is so weird because he was conscious enough as this was happening 
[04:07:00]  to look at me and know that I was going to come on the air with this tomorrow.  And he didn't stop.  But I was just with him.  He was a madman on a mission just full of testosterone and cum.  We just had a good time.  Wow.  No, it was nothing like that.  Lauren, people in Paltago want to know, did you copy that ass?  Great question.  No, I did not.  My managers and bosses were there.  Yeah, that would have been a little awkward.  So were Dennis's.  It didn't stop him.  No, it was just something out of Mad Men like you guys were in Sydney. 
[04:07:30]  Just a goofy thing.  You didn't watch that show.  No, but it was just something.  I know it's taking place in the 60s, early 60s.  Lauren.  Yes.  Were you around when he started making claims about his belt buckle?  Oh, yes.  I wanted to mention that to Obey and you guys.  Thank you.  Actually, my manager brought this up later and he was laughing his head off about it.  But he said, hey, ladies, I have a mistletoe belt.  Who wants to be the first?  No, no, no.  I did not say that.  I said, I would.  You keep saying I did not say that.  Because you guys hear these things. 
[04:08:00]  I didn't say that.  I said, I worked with a guy who wore a mistletoe belt buckle.  And I said what he said.  I wouldn't do that.  I said, wouldn't it be funny if I said.  No, I'm not that stupid.  You didn't hear that.  Come on.  You were trying to get the tip kiss.  No, no, not at all.  Not at all.  I'm believing Lauren on this one.  Here comes the pre.  Guys.  No.  All right.  All right.  Who wants to go deep sea diving?  No.  Not at all.  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Good for you. 
[04:08:30]  Not at all.  Danny's trying to get some.  Lauren's testimony is really hanging Danny out to dry here.  Ever since.  No, no, no, no.  I love Dennis.  Dennis is a great guy.  He's funny.  He's a predator.  No, he's bad.  It was all early.  It was all good fun.  I mean, it got a little inappropriate.  Oh, my God.  Cousin Bruce is going to punch Danny in the face.  Oh, my God.  He's very protective of you.  Well, he actually made a comment last night out of nowhere.  He was like, I'm co-hosting the show with you guys in two weeks.  I'm like, Dennis, what are you talking about? 
[04:09:00]  There was nothing said about you co-hosting the show with me and Cousin Bruce.  Did you say that?  What's that?  Yeah, he said that.  Bruce wants me to help him out.  Just do some stuff.  No, but did you announce to Lauren that you'd be co-hosting with him?  Yeah, Bruce said, why don't you come in on one night?  He never said that, Dennis.  Oh, my God.  Yes, he did.  He asked me yesterday.  He said he'd like me to help out on one Saturday night or one Wednesday night.  So he goes, why don't you come in and co-host with me one night?  I said, I'd love to.  Wow, I think you black out or something.  I do, too.  I think you black out because Cousin Bruce does not ask anybody to co-host that show ever. 
[04:09:30]  Okay, we'll see.  Oh.  We'll see.  We'll see.  It's a first time for everything.  No, no, we'll see.  Ever since Dennis has grown this Tom Selleck mustache, he's just been all sexed up.  No, no, no.  You know what I mean?  No, no, no, no, no.  More like a Dennis Weaver.  No, no, no, no, no.  Got Dennis Weaver in the studio.  He's got the McCloud.  You got the McCloud.  Let's just call it the McCloud.  McCloud.  This picture tells the story, doesn't it?  Oh, shit.  What is he doing there? 
[04:10:00]  He's holding the ice bucket.  Right.  Full of beer.  And he's got a dopey smile on his face.  Everybody's ignoring him.  Right.  But he's obviously the wild man of the party.  Somebody said, Dennis, do something funny.  So the ice was there.  I picked it up.  And I said, they sent me for ice.  We're trying to get everyone going at this party.  It was good, clean fun.  Good, clean fun.  Oh, look at you there with the crew.  Yeah.  There you are.  Picture you up on the copy machine copying that ass.  Nice, Lauren.  Nice.  Look at the selfie with Scott there. 
[04:10:30]  It was a good picture.  Oh, yeah.  It's Scott.  The professional ping pong player, apparently.  Eric had to jump into that one.  Oh, E-Rock's in there?  Yeah.  E-Rock had to get a little FaceTime?  Uh-huh.  There he is.  I like that.  I like that.  That looks like a fun little party.  We got to take a break.  Certainly, we're going to go back to this topic.  I don't think I think he should move on.  As more stories surface.  There was no more stories.  Yes.  Lauren, thank you for your testimony.  No problem. 
[04:11:00]  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  There goes Lauren.  Okay, look at this.  This dude from Hits One right here.  His name's Tommy.  And he tweeted.  He just sent this tweet out.  Can you hear me?  Oh, boy.  What?  At Dennis Falcone is drinking and making sexually inappropriate comments at female Saffir's.  I was breaking my chops.  More witnesses.  More witnesses.  I don't even know who this Tommy guy is.  Exactly.  Who is he, by the way?  Because he also took a picture of our studio.  He works on Hits One.  He's a producer over at Hits One.  He's a fan of the show.  He seems like a cool guy. 
[04:11:30]  Denny, are you claiming conspiracy now?  That all these people are conspiring?  I'm an easy target.  You know that.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  These guys like that.  You know what makes you an easy target?  You go up to young female employees and you ask them to put their ass.  No, no, no.  Clench those asses.  I love that ass.  You guys take it.  Take a copy of that ass.  You know what makes you an easy target?  When you announce to the girls at the party that your belt is made of mistletoe.  No, again, I said I worked with a guy who would show up at a party with a mistletoe belt buckle.  Who wants to suck this dick? 
[04:12:00]  A long time ago.  And that guy was you, wasn't it?  No, that was not me.  That was Mitch Kumstein.  I have a perfect record.  That guy worked for a guy that wants.  I have a perfect record and you know that.  Ladies, ladies, this Falcone cock ain't going to suck itself.  I do not say anything that rude and vulgar.  I'm talking to you in HR.  Come on now.  Did you point to your turgid cock and say, what are we going to do about this?  Did you go Jay Moore on everyone?  If I drank as much as everybody said, I'd miss the stop and I'd be in Riverhead by now on the train. 
[04:12:30]  Did you pull your bag out through your zipper and sing Jingle Balls?  That'd be funny.  And then you'd jump around and make them jingle?  No, no.  Hey, Lauren, I know you're new around here, but what are you going to do about this?  No.  No, Lauren is a very good person to have on the team.  She's a good worker.  Are you sure none of this happened?  Not one bit.  Look, some funny stuff happened.  Yes.  Some funny stuff.  He went, let's go in the supply closet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stuff.  I would, you know, whatever.  I would go to other friends' houses like a party. 
[04:13:00]  You know, a bunch of couples.  You know, in my house.  And I'd get up to go to the restroom.  And I'd come out with just a towel wrapped around me and say, is it okay if I take a shower?  You guys got any soap?  You'd come out nude.  No, with a towel.  I said towel.  Just a towel.  See you?  With their towel?  Just for fun.  You take all your clothes off?  Your dick is on their towel?  No.  No.  No, no, no, no.  I would just do something goofy.  I don't do that anymore.  Just leave your clothes off at someone's house.  It's fun.  I'm just leaving up a dicker.  Just fun.  Yeah.  Hey, is it okay if I take a shower?  I want to fresh it up.  Just for the quick joke. 
[04:13:30]  That's a quick fun.  Just quick joke.  Opie, you have young children.  Did you get a big laugh?  Yeah, I always did.  You have young children in the house.  How would you feel if you invited Dennis over?  Well, the problem is he's not going to be invited to my house.  Never.  Oh, my God.  That's too creepy for me.  What if Dennis and Anthony broken out his character, the naked DJ at your party?  Oh, shit.  Why don't you do naked DJ at his?  No, because he hired me to work.  Oh, he was working.  See?  I know where to draw the line as being a professional.  He's either on the clock or on the cock.  No.  Next time you have him DJing your party, you've got to have a point where you go, 
[04:14:00]  okay, you're off the clock.  You're done.  Hang out.  Hang out.  And then he's going to come walking out of your bathroom with your towel on.  Oh, yeah.  He will be fucking someone doggy style within 15 minutes in your movie theater.  No, I wouldn't take off all my clothes.  I'd have lots of shorts on or something.  I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, but your bare chest?  Yeah, why?  Oh, Jesus.  Imagine it's coming out.  Wait a second.  When people go in a pool, are they bare chest?  Well, they do.  Yeah, but not in their living room.  No, and I have done that a long time, maybe when I was like 29. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, there you go.  You said you would do that now.  No, I wouldn't.  You just said that.  Those people don't invite me to their house anymore.  Why?  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Because you came out in a fucking towel.  I felt like it was a joke.  It was just a joke.  Just a joke.  Just having a good time with Denny.  That's all.  Yeah.  That's all.  All right, Denny.  Very good.  I appreciate the time, though, guys.  Sam, I hope I gave you enough fodder for today.  Oh, boy.  Dennis, you're an endless fountain.  I love it.  Yeah.  You're a soldier. 
[04:15:00]  I feel bad I missed that party.  That would have been fun to hang around and listen to Denny going off like this.  Just trying to get it sucked.  However, he had to get it done.  No, no, no.  Whoever, however.  All I want to do is make people laugh and give them a smile.  That's all.  And if you can come, then that's just a bonus.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  I just want people to have a good time and laugh.  Yeah, me too.  Where do you dry hump the women around here?  No, we don't do that.  Is there a closet you take them to?  The dry hump closet.  Let me show you how we program here at Series X.  You don't put your hands on anyone. 
[04:15:30]  Never.  That's right.  But if it's through the clothes, that doesn't count.  No, not at all.  But your elbow's a fair play, if you know what I mean, right?  Yeah.  A little elbow tit.  Right.  Squeezing.  Passing each other in the hallway.  I feel like I need body armor whenever I come into this studio with you guys.  So do the girls around here.  Oh, boy.  They're around here.  Picked it up, Denny.  I love it.  That's because you're a professional broadcaster.  Thank you for the compliment.  I'm a broadcast professional.  And a party professional.  I don't need you flirting with me.  What do they call him?  The octopus? 
[04:16:00]  Is that it?  Oh, he's all over.  Well, look at that.  How many hands does he have?  No, no.  No hands.  If there is one word to describe Denny, it's handsy.  But whatever I say to these lines, it's like with Groucho.  I always grab my glasses or something.  Hey, hi.  Hey, hi.  Nobody ever called into a radio show to say, Groucho Marx made me feel sexually uncomfortable  at the workplace last night.  No, she did not say that.  She did not say that.  And the secret word is intercourse.  Oh, shit.  Quack, quack. 
[04:16:30]  Yeah, you kind of got it like a Groucho thing almost.  Exactly.  Dennis Weaver-ish.  Yeah.  Except not the sense of humor, unfortunately.  Yeah, yeah.  Just the mustache.  Well, you know.  I have a pretty good sense of humor.  Oh, yeah, you do.  Yes, I do.  Yes, you do, Dan.  People like me.  You know that?  People like me.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, guys.  Have a great weekend.  Thank you.  Oh, Kenny.  Anything?  Can I just say one thing?  Uh-huh.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  Yeah, and that's today's look at the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony Show.
