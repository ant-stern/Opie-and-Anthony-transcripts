<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment focusing on a series of three sexually explicit audio sweepers created by producer Jimmy.  These sweepers, repeatedly described as "gay" and filled with vulgar language detailing graphic sexual acts between Opie and Anthony, initially caused hesitation from the hosts due to potential listener backlash.  Despite this, the sweepers were played, prompting a call-in segment where listeners reacted, many finding the humor in the explicit nature.  A discussion ensued about whether to incorporate the sweepers into the regular show rotation.  This initial segment also included listener calls with jokes about the hosts' personal lives and a lengthy tangent about an alleged Regis Philbin affair based on a purported diary entry from a cheerleader.  Bill Dwyer from BattleBots and Old Dirty, a message board contributor, were guests in studio during this portion.

The show then transitioned into a rambling, vulgar conversation punctuated by music and comedic bits.  The anniversary of Biggie Smalls' death sparked a discussion including conspiracy theories about Puff Daddy,  followed by complaints about aggressive driving in NYC, particularly targeting Asian drivers, with subsequent jokes about various driver demographics. The XFL was another topic, with a humorous news story about a paraplegic injured in the stands providing comedic fodder.  Spaz, a guest, recounted an outrageously expensive stay at the St. Regis Hotel, detailing his extravagant spending spree using a new credit card, leading to discussions about debt and irresponsible spending.  A "best ass" contest featured Patty, a contestant performing a song on electric guitar, with Reno, Patty's friend, providing sarcastic commentary. Old Dirty remained a recurring guest throughout this segment.  The overall tone was highly irreverent, rife with racial slurs, offensive stereotypes, frequent interruptions, and tangents, relying heavily on shock value and absurd humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of O.B. and Anthony, 1027 WNEW.  Alright, you want to do the gay sweepers, Anthony?  Yeah, what is this now? They made sweepers, and it's based on the ambiguously gay duo theme from SNL cartoons.  Now, I don't want Jimmy insulting, because he does all the production for our show, and he does a great job. He really does.  Uh-huh. But I don't know if we would just throw these sweepers into the general rotation, I think it would, I don't know, it would perk some people up out there. 
[00:00:30]  And I don't know if we want to go down that road. The old dirt road.  Yeah, exactly.  Alright, let's give a listen, and we'll all judge together.  Alright? We have to decide if these should go into the rotation.  Alright.  Okay? So listen along.  They're really gay.  Great. They're extremely gay.  That's a winner!  It's our turn in the barrel, Anthony. Here it goes.  We weren't even going to play them on the air.  Let's hear what Jimmy put together.  I don't even want to push this button. 
[00:01:00]  I haven't heard this yet.  You've heard them?  Oof.  Alright.  Okay.  Are you ready?  No, but let's go.  Alright, here.  Are you sure?  Okay, here.  Give it a try.  Hopefully you have them today.  The ambiguity is the gay.  Oh, I love it already.  Is that a moral?  Yes.  Suck it, you whore.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What a mess.  The ambiguity is the gay duo.  1027 WNEW.  That's a winner.  Alright, look.  Mm-hmm.  What?  What is that?  I don't know.  Maybe Jimmy's mad at us.  He gave them to, like, Ben and Rick and said,  Here, put these in the rotation.  Oh, yeah.  Just let it fly.  It's me sucking Opie's c**t. 
[00:02:00]  Alright, I had to dump out of myself.  Great.  Great thing.  As I was saying, it's me sucking Opie's c**t.  Great.  Great.  Great sweeper.  Yeah, that's not real ambiguous.  You pretty much know what's going on.  You're pretty much doing the thing.  Yeah, there's no room for doubt.  That's blatant.  He just wanted to throw it in.  Be part of the rotation.

[00:14:00]  enough to realize that a lot of people over the years have goofed on lost in space and the fact that  dr smith uh was uh banging young william or something you know i'm not gonna sit and cry  never really happened yeah it was all a statement of imagination i'm not gonna sit and cry  anthony what's up i got i gotta say uh regis today was the funniest thing  because this whole thing comes out with him uh boning some other chick like eight years ago  and now he gets uncomfortable on his own show yeah oh you know why because it's all true 
[00:14:30]  in the paper and he had to deal with his wife and everything oh you know that's he he's denying  it his lawyers are denying it everyone's denying it but you know something if it's in the paper like  this and and uh this woman says she has a her diary and dates and there's pictures of them together  um i'm willing to believe it when you put yourself out there when you put yourself out there you 
[00:15:00]  know people i can't believe it gelman they caught me years later  they caught me like i couldn't i couldn't stand it fantastic you know when you when you're there  with joy for so many years and a voluptuous cheerleader comes up you got a banger gelman  who wants to bang a cheerleader i do yeah i know well if you read uh she's got a hot little body on  it too you see the picture in the post my god she's got something herself with those huge firm boobs well  she she put on a little bit of weight from her younger days but it seems to have all gone to 
[00:15:30]  the right spot she's she's definitely doable still though and she's got like the big boobs and there's  regis a picture of him next to her look i'm laughing uh they didn't have uh intercourse is what is what  um she's saying which i'm remembering now when the whole monica lewinski thing went down yeah  what went down with clinton and uh they were talking about it on live with regis and cassie lake  and regis always looked a little squirmy as they were talking about it and everybody thought it was 
[00:16:00]  because you know regis doesn't want to get really deep into that kind of thing and it embarrasses him  but the truth of the matter is he was in the same boat there's the married guy getting oral and giving  oral it looks like they were doing a little 69 and saying that it isn't sex that's that's a visual  and it wasn't cheating to to have in my brain i love it i got very bury my head in that and in the  there i can't believe you're dumb and you gotta move your head all around get your face involved 
[00:16:30]  come on my tongue is numb i know how to eat it  just grab a hold of that there now shake it like a pom-pom you bitch shake it yeah i guess  he was uh what a cheerleading coach hey it just says the buxom x cheerleader maria majarek yeah  back in 1991 be aggressive b e aggressive let's read some of her diary shall we i guess she didn't 
[00:17:00]  do well on her sats either october 27th 1991 i met him in his dressing room he was nice enough to take  a picture with me there you go the first little encounter and then uh a few days later november 1st  wow oh she says wow ripping us off you wouldn't believe this regis called he's so fun to talk to  such a uh dommer i guess notre dame fan um that was only a couple days later so i guess 
[00:17:30]  she slipped him her phone number for him to call and they talked and then april of 92 a few months  later uh after a notre dame a basketball team played in a new york tourney he kissed me that day  who i was startled by it i was both flattered and intimidated i was exhilarated by the fact of who  he was i'm regis look at me i grab you and i'm gonna shove my tongue down your throat you whore 
[00:18:00]  come on suck it and then uh two months later in june after a trip to new york to talk with a pub  a publisher about a book on cheerleading a book on cheerleading wow we went back to his office and  before i knew it he had his arms around me and kissed me it was great yeah suck it i love it well she

[00:20:30]  regis got hold of me and told me i'm in room such and such so i guess she went to his room we were very  passionate as always and stayed together for hours he really made me feel like a woman all right  now now put two and two together there he made her really feel like a woman i do believe he's good  at the oral without intercourse right yeah oh you gotta dig it you can't be afraid gelman

[00:54:30]  yeah so 10 pounders are like the bunts and stuff right maybe in the in the big ass contest you know  and they wear the tight pants and in front you're seeing you call it the sack  you're always like ooh we call it a moose knuckle camel toe or smuggle in a yo-yo  i never heard of that that's great smuggle in a yo-yo and some of them it looks like a dunkin  butterfly really i know yo-yos i know yo-yo it's no phantom it's a butterfly that's great 
[00:55:00]  wow the old dirty teaches us something new about uh about the hood every day yeah  yeah very exciting now i know about a sack if you said you had your face next to a sack  it would sound bad because you would think you're talking about a guy exactly you know the yan bag  yeah no no no yan bag all right let's go to jay i never heard the yan bag hey what's up hey guys  hey i just wanted to say battle bots is great i i got a question though sure you guys have any idea  what powers those things i mean i'm really interested i mean it's like half the things that are like 
[00:55:30]  attached to those things i use at work every day you know and i just can't imagine what powers these things  you know what's uh you know what's weird uh what powers a lot of the battle bots is uh wheelchair  motors oh really i swear wheelchair motors yeah so somewhere there's some poor guy rolling around  going hey man are my batteries out what did you do my little rascal oh man i can't go anywhere now  yeah wheelchair motors and uh and they work great wheelchair motors and pneumatics a lot of pneumatics 
[00:56:00]  what do you think of seeing all the the bots you've seen what are the best ones what are the ones that  make it i'll tell you one of my favorites is uh one called tasbot because he kind of reminds me of  the lost in space robot because he's got a big floppy tail and when he gets tipped over it's like some  bad you know it's like a bad experience you had a camp you know or whatever and just kind of swings  there and he's uh and he's got a lifting arm and stuff i like tasbot a lot i like uh i like biohazard  and uh and uh and i don't mind buddy lee i don't like buddy lee i like the spinners i like uh oh 
[00:56:30]  i love the spinners that one way that is just so destructive what was the spinner built by that  guy that seemed like an effing lunatic he was an older guy in his family it was probably yeah it was  mauler yeah mauler and the chilford family yeah that friggin thing would get spinning and it if  it was really getting some rpms up and hit something it would send it flying across uh the ring but  it was unbalanced that is the problem it was unbalanced so they're going to come back because  i i met those you know when we were doing battle bots i met those guys i said to the old guy i said 
[00:57:00]  uh how you doing general and they go no no no he's supreme commander i'm okay oh hey some of these  people look a little owl i saw i saw a couple of guys that had spent a lot of time building their bots  and describing it was just like oh how's that for a topper they are certainly focused they  are very focused but it's something they love and that's why i got to say that about them you know  they they might have a little crazy in them but they obviously love what they're doing and that's 
[00:57:30]  really cool all right let's take a break we'll be back give us a call 212-757-1027  hey we're hanging with bill dwyer from battle bot playing the stress factory in new brunswick  new jersey tonight and saturday very funny guy having a lot of fun here today i think we've uh  we found a new friend anthony i like this place anytime you're in new york you come by and uh hang

[01:34:00]  much uh i made less than spaz yeah at my first radio job this is officially spaz's first radio  yeah now well you gotta take into consideration the cost of living and the the things go up the  pay rate has gone up and it was the early 70s yeah right so so on an even basis probably comparable  to what you were making uh yeah that's fair enough sure um so if you were going to stay in manhattan 
[01:34:30]  you would probably really shop around for a hotel because it's very hard to stay in manhattan  for under a couple of hundred bucks in a room it doesn't matter where you stay you're gonna if you  could get a rate of 150 oh my god you're lucky and i would be all over price line yeah and i would  panic if it was anything um more than two hundred dollars i would panic but it's my birthday i'm with my  new girlfriend because erica's kind of like a new girl with spaz seven months seven months  it's relatively new uh-huh i'd splurge and go okay i think i could i could swing about two hundred 
[01:35:00]  dollars two bills no more no less right that would get you what howard johnson something something  the 11th ave the holiday inn over here in midtown maybe something uh something nice you know but  you're not fleabag but you're not talking the uh four-star luxury right hotel okay um anyone want  a hazard to guess which hotel spaz chose to stay at oh no it's bad how many stars four-star hotel dude 
[01:35:30]  hold up another finger they go up to five yeah a five-star hotel yeah what are you nuts what then i think  after the four seasons this is rated the top hotel hotel and that happened dude he stayed at the saint  regis oh my god oh my goodness like could you ever dream of walking in there unless it was a freebie 
[01:36:00]  for a promotional thing or something all right spaz let me tell you something and i do uh uh we're doing  pretty well these days not great still still underpaid i would i i wouldn't spend a night there i don't  have the money for that i'm diamond spaz baby the saint regis we stayed at the saint regis now this is  great this is great did you have a doorman and everything did you bring your bag i had a butler  they assigned a personal butler to each room yes a personal butler so adriam yes uh jeez jeez uh could 
[01:36:30]  you get the car uh uh give me a ride around the park you know how i love the park  i think i would like to take a bath 
[01:37:00]  i'll alert the media  all right spaz so you figured you were splurging yes did you have any idea how much this was going to  cost no see i called to the pennsylvania and the peninsula hotel but i couldn't get a reservation so  i i only knew of the saint regis so you just called and said i need it for monday night didn't ask the  cost or anything right i did ask the cost but i thought that the amount that they gave me was the  standard price for a room and how much was the amount they gave you on the phone they gave me on  the phone six and a quarter but it was oh my god right dude dude if you even want to go if you even 
[01:37:30]  want to go a little higher end for a hotel instead of like the holiday in or the days in or something like  that there's the uh the novitel which is like a upper end the sheridan the uh the parker meridian  the park which is right right across the street these are all hotels based in the 200 uh frame  on 200 to 300 frame 600 and what 25 625 for a room with a personal butler what did the butler do 
[01:38:00]  give me the whole butler's whole little schedule he could have gotten a great set of pots for that  price yeah right right all right hold on so you you uh i'm stammering like fast now  you're so stupid you're so stupid so did you pull up to the saint regis yeah actually uh we  walked from grand central to the city walking from grand central to the city at least get your 
[01:38:30]  woman like a uh a cab rider get her a limo a limo with a duffel bag it was funny though that they  were all like didn't want to let me in at first because i was wearing my my heavy metal t-shirt  with my poor jeans and my legend okay so that was a little wet this is great all right so then you  i wanted i gotta know what the butler did uh the butler forget he pressed my clothes  he dropped your heavy metal concert t-shirt he ironed your clothes he ironed my clothes 
[01:39:00]  did he iron your underwear and everything no just like my just my pants iron your clothes and was it  the heavy metal t-shirt or something else it was a heavy metal t-shirt and the shirt that i wore to  plazano's later that night yes your heavy metal t-shirt is done sir would you like the creases down the  side there sorry sorry i seem to have put the crease in the wrong spot you know you know 
[01:39:30]  now it's van did you indulge in any room service uh no no but but i did being thrifty but i did tackle  the uh the the alcohol bar oh the mini bar in the wrong now those things are very expensive i didn't  know that what it what do you mean you didn't know well i found the bar menu after i partook in the 
[01:40:00]  alcohol and you thought wait you thought it was like a comp like it was free yes there was 600  some odd dollars for a room you figured that the alcohol was free and alcohol to get you over the bill  and the rice crispy bar and the candy bar and so how much was your mini bar bill well well they  they added everything all together for a grand total of what of 743 dollars  and 43 dollars for a night do you realize that that's a month's pay that's easily a month a month's 
[01:40:30]  pay for you yeah but i didn't pay by cash oh you used your credit card i just got a credit card oh my god  i just got it like five days ago oh no is this your first credit card my very first oh my god  do you know what this is give me your credit card i'm gonna do you a favor i'm gonna rip it up right  now i'm gonna i'm gonna cut it in half but that's not well i there's a lot more than 743 spent on it  right now what's your what's your um maximum what's your limit on the card 5500 5500 how much do you have on 
[01:41:00]  it already how much do i spend on it yeah how much is already uh two grand and you got it how long  ago five days ago five days you are on the slippery slope of credit card debt your pal anthony can tell  you all about this point in my life when i had a crappy uh job i had three credit cards and about 
[01:41:30]  twenty thousand dollars in credit card debt it took me three years of doing radio up in boston  making uh more than i was making in construction but it took me three years to pay off the card  paid off and making a real effort i mean throwing every spare dime i had at the credit card uh bill  and i was making a pretty good money now you're making um entry-level money yes in five days you 
[01:42:00]  have cut your credit limit in half on this card you're probably going to go out and and do the other  half within a week no i'm gonna hide it on myself it doesn't work what else did you buy well i'm wearing  part of it now the shirt and jeans that i'm wearing now yeah that i spent i've got it all  a good uh good price at old navy ah good price at old navy and then what else any other splurges  dinner did you uh yes paisanos ah paisanos what that's free we eat free there tip though i mean  you put the tip on the credit card you put the tip on the credit card all right now i gotta ask you 
[01:42:30]  this one too cash advance uh no no cash i haven't got my picture for that yet oh but when you get your  pin number do you know how much uh interest is on the uh cash advance no clue do you know how much  interest you're paying on this card i believe 12.9 but i didn't read the paperwork yet it's probably  12.9 for the first three months and then it goes up to like 99 yeah and then cash advance is closer to  25 yep percent so i mean your minimum payment could be like 80 bucks out of that 80 10 of it will go 
[01:43:00]  towards paying off your debt and 70 they pocket as as interest well it's amazing and it says it never  ends because you know what happens when you get done chalking this up they'll send you more and you  will use them i know you i did the same thing and you know something to this day after i paid it all up  i do not own a credit card i have an american express card that gets paid off the end of the month and that 
[01:43:30]  is its credit cards are so freaking dangerous especially at your age your pay rate and and  you seem like you're getting a little irresponsible here five days two grand how do you how could you  pay off oh my god at the saint regis 740 bucks in 143 bucks for one night how long were you in your  room space trump uh not counting sleeping well yeah i was kind of angry i fell asleep like 11 o'clock  uh and then you woke up a couple hours time to check out a couple hours tops because i was in 
[01:44:00]  in the hat and just shopping so you fell asleep 11 at night yeah and you woke up when i woke up at  about two hours before check out so so he oh my god he spent the night in a bed so you you checked in  for 743 bucks yeah they left to do shopping what time did you check in i checked in at uh two o'clock  okay two o'clock he's getting his money's worth so but you were out of the room until you came back when  i was out of the room until nine nine at night so two hours he's what you're watching tv yes did 
[01:44:30]  you rent any of the movies no just we're just watching tv just watching tv two hours later he's  out yes did you bang in the room all right that's not information i can i'm just thinking with that  kind of cash and two hours you're in the room uh you better have had a really good time personal  information okay all right so you banged her all right um so so 740 bucks go on your credit card 
[01:45:00]  for one night yes was it worth it do you wish you would have stayed at a different place maybe without  the butler a butler opie have you ever stayed in a hotel with a butler no i don't want to no  funny part i have no desire to be that fancy out creepy but the place is great though yeah setup is  wonderful it's wonderful yeah i bet uh this just in from stone sea from jersey tell spaz to hide his  credit card in the same place he puts his brain that way he'll never find it spaz did you lie on
