<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with Opie and Anthony recounting their recent speeding tickets on the Long Island Expressway, leading to a humorous discussion of methods to avoid police. Anthony's attempts to use his PBA cards to get out of a ticket with the same officer twice in a month were a particular highlight. This segment included listener calls about traffic and PBA cards.  Opie then detailed a harrowing on-air intervention where he prevented a suicidal caller from taking their own life; a clip of the gun discharging accidentally was played.  The ensuing news coverage, omitting Anthony's involvement, was also discussed. Robert Kelly filled in for Jim Norton, who was at Bonnaroo. Anthony’s surprisingly domesticated behavior, attributed to a new relationship with Jill, was a major topic,  accompanied by photos of him babysitting Keith's children.  Callers reacted with amusement to this change. The segment also briefly covered Tim Russert's death and Tiger Woods's participation in the US Open, along with Opie’s Brazilian steakhouse digestive woes.

The show then veered into a discussion about Bob's chest hair and the perceived "dirtiness" of pubic hair, particularly around children at the beach. This transitioned into the "FU Line" segment.  The hosts heavily debated R. Kelly's acquittal on child pornography charges, expressing disbelief and cynicism about the justice system. This led to a discussion of the "perv switch" and hypothetical schemes involving secretly filming girls in a locker room,  including sexually suggestive scenarios with a lesbian gym teacher.  A caller recounted a high school football coach's inappropriate shower behavior, and another shared experiences with a hot gym teacher. Anthony's fictitious suicide hotline was also humorously discussed, as was the legitimacy of "vagina dentata," with caller accounts fueling the speculation. The legalization of gay marriage in California and George Takei's upcoming wedding were briefly mentioned. The segment concluded with promotion of Anthony's babysitting services.

A discussion about the Sirius Satellite Radio merger and Eric Logan's job security followed.  The hosts' playful destruction of their studio console, involving raising it to an extreme height and unplugging random wires,  led to comedic mishaps.  Bob Kelly joined the show, and a discussion ensued about a biography claiming Abraham Lincoln was gay, which led to sexually explicit and crude discussions about Lincoln's sexuality. The hosts recounted their frustration at a comedy club over not receiving freebies, leading to a highly offensive and vulgar phone call with a listener filled with homophobic and fat-shaming slurs.  The political climate, taxes, and the challenges of quarterly tax payments were discussed. Jay Moore, a guest, joined the show, talking about his upcoming TV show and sharing anecdotes about his divorce, a child's karate recital, golf, and baseball; all interwoven with crude humor and offensive language.  Further discussion of Jay Moore’s TV show and speculation about Jim Norton’s Bonnaroo experience concluded this section.

The next segment began with more banter about Anthony's babysitting and his changed behavior due to his new relationship.  The hosts then launched into a highly sexually explicit and vulgar discussion about Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, a lesbian couple marrying after 55 years together, filled with graphic descriptions and crude jokes about aging genitalia.  This transitioned into a discussion about past experiences of lesbians, including arrest, job loss, and electroshock therapy, with continued use of offensive and sexually explicit language.  The topic then shifted to incest, specifically the possibility of having sex with a cousin.  The hosts then discussed animated versions of themselves, leading to a commentary on racial disparities in fatherhood, statistics on single-parent households, Barack Obama's stance on the issue, and speculation about a conspiracy to capture Osama bin Laden. The segment ended with a listener's line of the day, advertisements, and a bizarre story about Earl from the Ron & Fez show involving vodka consumption from his buttocks, including descriptions of explicit photographs and speculation about Earl's sexuality. The hosts shared opinions on bachelor and bachelorette parties and paid sex, and the broadcast concluded with a discussion about videos of bachelorette parties featuring explicit sexual acts.  Jay Moore and Bobby Kelly were mentioned as being in studio.

The final segment heavily featured the hosts watching and discussing hardcore pornography online, using extremely vulgar and sexually explicit language to describe the content from websites like Tube8.com.  They attempted to find a specific video titled "Loverboy" or "Loverboy USA," debating the authenticity of the depicted acts. Bobby Kelly, present in the studio, assisted in the search.  The segment concluded with a heated confrontation between producer Earl and an unidentified person (Mark), resulting in Earl's angry outburst filled with insults and expletives, culminating in him storming out of the studio.

[00:01:30]  is it monday already it certainly is stupid monday  you gotta say monday weird i've got a case of the mondays  so every week starts off yeah you just you just try to eat through till friday don't you 
[00:02:00]  i had a great weekend thanks for asking it's the opie and anthony show  i did have a good weekend until i had to drive back to new york city last night  that's a bitch of a drive i know we broadcast to uh america yep and maybe this isn't that  interesting for cleveland or boston or buffalo or syracuse to name the rest of the cities  everybody can relate to sitting in traffic but i do believe we have the worst highway in america 
[00:02:30]  it's called the long island expressway we have basically one road that gets you from long island  to new york city yeah there's a couple others but basically it's the long island expressway  and they just refuse to tackle the problem i don't know what they could do about it to tell you the  truth they gotta do something layers and layers of roadway on top of each other 50 need 50 roads 
[00:03:00]  all stacked up on top of each other maybe i was way out east uh celebrating father's day with my uh  brother and his family and uh should take just under two hours to get back to new york city because i  was way out there yeah not close to four hours on a sunday night at 9 15 you shouldn't be going  five miles an hour infuriating i don't care where you live that just should not ever ever happen 
[00:03:30]  unless it's like fourth of july weekend and you're coming back from uh fireworks displays yeah at a  park or a school or a uh a beach and i was i had a really good weekend by the time i got back to new  york i i was exhausted and miserable i almost pulled my car over and just started weeping well it got to  the point where i couldn't do it anymore i i wanted to just weep what time were you uh were you driving  uh from 6 30 6 15 actually so it was just under four hours i had to make a pit stop so 6 15 to uh 
[00:04:00]  just after 10 o'clock see because i was driving back from out east yeah i know the story you're  going to tell that's what i'm setting up here that's what i don't understand at about 8 30 ish right i  guess and i got pulled over for speeding going 88 miles an hour 88 and 55 that's what i don't 
[00:04:30]  understand how how is it that i'm going 5 to 10 miles an hour and you get a ticket for speeding  on the same highway because in the space of about 50 feet i could get up to 88 miles an hour  i guess everyone decided to hit what the long island expressway after you got pulled over or something  because it was a nightmare out there yeah i know you go further uh west obviously into new york city  than i do so it really gets bad when you start getting uh it got bad before your queens not to 
[00:05:00]  get uh too uh specific here but yeah it was definitely bad before your exit so maybe maybe i don't know  whatever maybe this is getting a little too picky but uh just just i guess the point i'm making i  completely exhausted today i was gonna get home nice and early get ready for the for another week of  radio and next thing you know i'm panicking like oh god if i go to sleep now i only get five hours  five hours yeah and then i'm laying in bed knowing i'm only gonna get five hours so now i'm panicking  and not falling asleep oh god now if my eyes shut now i'll only get four and a half hours go to sleep 
[00:05:30]  right now right right this instant instead of talk to myself about when i can go to sleep exactly  and then i'm sleeping soundly and also my head pops off the pill oh my god i overslept what time is it  it was 3 30 so now at 3 30 i'm like okay i got another hour of sleep before the alarm goes off  i got another hour of sleep if i close my eyes right now why why can't i close my eyes right now 
[00:06:00]  and then i just laid there in bed wide awake so basically i slept four and a half hours yeah  not happy about it not much sleep on my end either uh oh god yeah i i was driving home uh  i had to uh i just i can't take my shelby out it's the car needs to go fast  it just needs to yeah that's why all weekend long i was like i'm taking the truck out 
[00:06:30]  because i don't want to get in trouble i was i was checking myself i'm like i'm taking the truck  out because i don't want to i know this car but it was nice out father's day i figured i head out  to see the family and uh take the shelby so i take it out there fine on the way out driving back  and uh suffolk highway suffolk highway gets me and this is a weird thing because i've always talked 
[00:07:00]  about this he had someone they're pulled over on the side of the road and his lights are on he's got  a car in front of him yeah so he's pulled over for me that's a free pass you know you don't i i hate  when people slow down in that situation because he's got somebody he's busy don't worry about it  so i go you know flying past him at uh 88 miles an hour  no i i wasn't in a delorean i wish i would have gone back in time and slowed down a bit 
[00:07:30]  you ass yeah 88 miles an hour and uh  i see him pull out and i'm like oh damn it he just finished up with this person  and now he sees me fly by and he's you know he's on me and uh oh he got on me so fast 
[00:08:00]  because you know i slowed down uh pulls me over yeah but that's when you you see what your car  could really do no then you get then it's big trouble that's what i'm thinking once you're  caught you're caught i'm not like that i'm not crazy like running from the cop guy you get that  shelby up to 100 110 and you get a few exits ahead of them and then you they'll call off the pursuit  and then and then and then you exit quickly about 70 75 miles an hour around one of those hairpin  turns and you yeah and then you're good then you take it for the roadblock that's going to be set up 
[00:08:30]  when i'm trying to get home then you take a quick right and then a quick left into the neighborhood  and just hang out is that it oh yeah how old are you get away stop 17 smoky in the bandit yeah  that's what you do well no i pulled over when i saw the lights silly me that you're dumb uh so  he gets out and uh of course just instantly starts berating me uh what was i doing why was i driving  so fast blah blah blah you know i don't have many answers to to these questions i'm just like you 
[00:09:00]  know in my head i want to go i'm driving a shelby i drive it goes fast so i go fast yeah but opi's  right i mean if you got that car you're driving fast well you only drive fast when nobody's chasing you  i mean yeah step on it yeah see what happens you get the money take the hit i keep not taking the  hit the hit by the way is getting my face put in the pavement a cop knee in my neck and cuffs put on  that's a man i'm not gonna that's a man all right that's you got guns you got fast cars now that's 
[00:09:30]  right start using them what are you like bunny and clyde over here that's the risk of driving a shelby  really quickly you gotta take the hit every once in a while yeah take the hit you got a hot chick  i'm with bobby have a change wedding dresses in the front seat smoking a bandit take the hit  no and you have to scream things like you'll never get me alive copper year is this the 30s right  take off your tea roofs that you don't have my tommy gun that's all right drop marbles in the road so

[00:12:00]  the shelby no kidding yeah so my i don't do this very often flew out the window the same cop pulled  you over yeah that was less than a month ago i know that was just before you met jill i think yes  that was the last supercar weekend that keith will ever see well i hope so because i can't afford this  anymore it was supposed to be like a regular thing you guys did one then yeah and uh you know and finds  a girl and then that's it he's got blinders on and doesn't even remember that he has friends or 
[00:12:30]  family well the good luck to you we were actually supposed to go to uh vegas this weekend shooting and  gambling and i had this whole weekend lined up for us and uh that ain't happening yeah  keith did you guys break up is he of course no we no we didn't break up so the same cop that pulled  you over for supercar weekend got you last night got me last night and just to refresh everyone's  memory seriously it was about a month and a half ago how fast did he get you that was a biggie right 
[00:13:00]  that was a biggie um so you're still dealing with that one i don't even want to mention it  it was triple digits yeah that's all i'll say yeah uh but but yeah the the whole thing last time  supercar weekend when a ferrari and a lamborghini are just racing down the road you're asking for  trouble it's it's you're just looking for it we got pulled over three times uh in the course of i  don't know 10 exits so uh last night i get pulled over like i said same cop how many times have you 
[00:13:30]  been pulled over in the last i can't even count i can't even count how many times have you been  pulled over this year alone has to be 10 has to be 10 times 10 yeah has to be 10 times so you have  officially lost your license because no one would allow that to happen ever ever ever well no i are  you driving illegally no no i i still have my license but who do i'll tell you what i don't have  do you know the mayor of this city or something i decided on the road i decided i was going to pull 
[00:14:00]  the cards now all right because he wasn't going for the radio show he uh had pulled me over prior  for uh the ferrari uh thing and now you know i'm i'm at risk here getting a ticket so i had to go to  the the old cards my collection of cards from various uh law enforcement agencies perhaps be a little  lenient on me uh knowing that uh i'm friends with a lot of the brotherhood well i i hand him all of 
[00:14:30]  the cards um because i started pulling one out and he goes just let me see him so i gave him you know  all the stack so he goes through him he goes back to the car uh jill has another cop on the phone  so gives him the phone and now he's talking to another cop who called a cop who apparently doesn't  like they don't like each other which isn't very good i'm assuming that not many people like this  guy i don't know but it seems that not many people do he's the same one that lives around my mom and 
[00:15:00]  sal and has been to parties at their house like i've met him at parties at my mother and sal's house  and apparently i've heard uh quote he'd give his own mother a ticket no kid yeah yeah yeah like this  guy's pretty badass nice so he asked me he goes through the uh speaker through his public address  out the car he's like uh please pull your car on the grass and step out of the vehicle and come to 
[00:15:30]  my passenger side window so i'm like okie dokie this is getting interesting uh so i i do as instructed  i get to the passenger side window um he uh he goes look here's the radar here's what you were  doing and shows me 88 he goes i have someone pulled over and you're passing me at 88 miles an hour  uh that's unacceptable a whole bunch of stuff but then he goes he goes i if i catch you doing this 
[00:16:00]  one more time i'm writing you up for everything i'm like ok sir yes sir gave him all the sir and he  goes and i'm keeping these he took all of my pba cards away from me oh it's like a game it's like  monopoly he took all of my cards monopoly go to jail he took all of my pba cards and he just threw  them in the side of his door like you know the garbage things on the side of your door i just heard 
[00:16:30]  them all go funk funk funk i hope your amex was in there that's what i was thinking too it's like  what i think he took like my my insurance card like my my health insurance card and everything  when he says uh when he said that he was going to write you up for everything if he pulls you over  again you should just went oh no no you don't go oh you know you don't you don't do that why  you don't you don't go oh so uh yeah he uh so you didn't get a speeding ticket no but he took all 
[00:17:00]  of my all of my cards did you take the gold one no i didn't pull the golden out because i was feeling  he would have just bent it in half and thrown it at my face so i i saved that one why are you  bitching though you didn't get a speeding ticket that's good i'm not bitching that's a win right  there i don't care what you say i understand it's a win but it's a win at the cost of all of my  my cards so you go a day without cards but now you're paranoid they're already mailing them in 
[00:17:30]  paranoid paranoid like a illegal immigrant driving around yeah and then and then of course the rest  of the trip home is double nickels with the cruise control on getting passed by old ladies  you should sell your car until you know the nassau county line and then but it's just you have to  be conscious of your of your driving forever now which stinks for a guy like in in suffolk yeah 
[00:18:00]  because this guy is everywhere he's super cop you know what this is super cop he's everywhere he's  following me he doesn't have to be con he should have been conscious years ago of his driving this  doesn't stop anthony are you kidding me steve from bay shore saying anth can't drive 50 flurf  50 flurf right i can't let's go to joe in queens joe yo guys what's up hey joe hey listen when next  time you get pulled over you have to say the paparazzi is following you at high speeds oh that's

[00:28:30]  million dollars oh people like it wasn't incredible hulk supposed to be the number one movie yeah you  can kind of tell which ones are going to be the number one movie right that was pretty much it but  uh i would love for one of these artsy movies out of nowhere you know they're the number one movie  at the box office 50 60 million for the weekend what is this about i went to the movies over the  weekend i haven't been to the movies in a long time yeah i think that's what keith is getting at 
[00:29:00]  oh really i got a bit of a uh a hint did you during the break yes oh i saw a couple pictures too  did you so i'm not gonna blow up your spot yes i went to the movies keith he did uh you know i do a  lot for anthony and we were out to dinner a week ago with uh jill my wife me and anthony and we were  talking about uh you know how my wife and i really don't get to go out that much and uh while we were  at dinner and we were talking about this jill volunteered to babysit my children all right you 
[00:29:30]  just scared the crap out of me that makes complete sense because i knew where this was leading and i'm  like there's no effing way anthony's gonna volunteer to watch your kids ever ever ever well as soon as  jill said yeah we'd love to watch the kids i looked at him and he goes yeah no problem sure and i why not  and i looked at him like who are you 
[00:30:00]  this is not my friend anthony why wouldn't i want to uh yeah help a buddy out and watch uh watch the  kids because you don't help anyone and you hate kids there's two reasons that do you want a third do  you want a fourth i don't think that's nice well i'm not trying to be me i'm just i'm just being  honest what would it take for you to actually watch someone's kids you got to be like way in 
[00:30:30]  love here my friend well i have already said i i what happened to your voice what happened  people have pointed that out no there wasn't a car seat in the shelby i already made my prediction  robert kelly robert kelly live.com uh and who's against kids and and being married those two things  will happen will happen you really think so will happen rapido jesus it's gonna happen in the next 
[00:31:00]  couple months i think it's gonna be sooner very fast i don't think anyone's gonna be surprised  around here but maybe the listeners will be extremely surprised but this is yeah this is uh this is uh  it's what everyone says when they see us together it's it's not even a doubt in my mind this is the  real anthony coming out i i always said that you'd be a great father i always said you would be great  with kids i always said you would you uh would be very very happy in a in a loving uh uh marriage 
[00:31:30]  that's all i'm saying you don't even have to comment i don't want to put any pressure on you but  i'm seeing things my friend we're going from babysitting to uh to marriage and kids here no  pressure so you i think uh uh and you went slow down you went from being single to extremely in  love saying i love you after the second date or whatever it was i was maybe the third all right  well this thing is moving fast you say i love you oh my god we both did that's all news by now don't 
[00:32:00]  throw her into it i'm just asking you do you say i love you why wouldn't i so you you really you  love i'm in love you really love her you really love her really really like love love wow bobby what  the hell is your problem yeah doesn't understand i don't bobby's bobby's married and still hasn't  told his wife he loves her it's not that it's just that it's just that you know i love you he's  getting close to saying i love you now that they've been married a while he's almost there 
[00:32:30]  i just don't believe i don't believe why are you holding hands with a kid this is not you  that's one of keith's little adorable children that what i think i saw that i saw that at the post  office too wait a minute davin busters after the movie but no kid wait a minute man kids will not  just hold your hand for the hell of it they have to feel very comfortable so what's that about  well what first off did you did you she wanted getting lost did you show your daughter uh anthony's 
[00:33:00]  bank account as well when the daughter said i'll hold your hand did you see the lady in the back  though i did have to have a long talk with her after a few kids oh what are you doing to him  look at look in the back right there that's your future what get out of here crazy that's your future  right what's out of your mind stay a rock and roll hot couple that's all i'm saying what's uh what's  in the background is a very very fat lady that looks like she's pregnant but i don't think she 
[00:33:30]  is she's walking with a extremely fat wow all right hold on we gotta we gotta organize here so  how uncomfortable does anthony he looks like his whole body is frozen i am i'm not no i see it the  other way my friend i see a a general happiness on anthony's face to you i swear to god because it was  very uncomfortable walking around yeah holding her hand yeah i felt all weird can we put that  picture up online i'm putting up a few right all right we're gonna put some pictures up on onaradio.com 
[00:34:00]  so keith and his wife went on a little date and jill and anthony also known as anthelini went  right and uh babysat we took the kids to the movies first and saw kung fu panda  what we saw kung fu panda look there's jill now we we saw kung fu panda it was um it was it was good 
[00:34:30]  it was a good movie it's one of those good you know animated computer animated uh movies it actually  got good reviews yeah it was fun how cool is that you chicks on the news by the way someone just wrote  i just threw up in my mouth a little uh jeff m from new york city there's something see the  people that have been with this show for a long time this is uh this is very strange because you  you've openly said you hate kids hate you said you wouldn't even hold your your brother's kid 
[00:35:00]  yeah no that's not true i did the coochie coo yeah on uh joe's uh yesterday you were happy for him  basically but well yeah basically we're like yeah you're changing man which is good to see  changing she call you babysat what does his kid call you uncle aunt or something no no what does  he call you anthony really yeah are you at chuck e cheese now in these other pictures no that's uh  dave and busters dave and buster after the movie we went to dave and buster's and and played games 
[00:35:30]  who's taking the photos uh random people a few listeners were there a few viewers yeah who takes  all these pictures when you guys are out and about uh fans no she's with with uh jill's camera oh okay  like they'll come up and say like hey i love the show or something and jill hand hand them a camera  and go could you take a picture is it appropriate to be deep kissing jill as the kids are trying to  pose for a nice picture in front of the drill-o-matic machine by the way see they're facing the camera 
[00:36:00]  and we're behind them so they had no clue what was going on see kids you're playing drill-o-matic  and so are we look at you uh you shouldn't be making out like that in front of two little kids  we're not we're behind their back look they can't see responsible babysitter al gore they can't see  anything oh my god so so uh what what panda movie what is oh kung fu kung fu panda was it a good 
[00:36:30]  movie yeah it was a good movie it's kind of funny though because the panda's name is poe  i know i heard it could be some sound clips when that movie makes it to dvd so did you enjoy  babysitting for kids kids uh yeah we had we had a good time it was fun the movie was good the kids  were great they they weren't uh annoying like uh kids can be and uh david busters was was fun uh me  and jill played air hockey and she beat me just uh you know just just like in the bad news bears 
[00:37:00]  he's finished right he went from just 9 000 miles an hour to just two in like a month you went  what i was in here one week and you were racing cars and guns and single and 19 maids in your house  just doing stuff to a babysitter uh i put this the first time i've uh look at your voice again there 
[00:37:30]  it goes this is the first time mom i just love i am it's the first time i babysat dude you know what  i i've been with anthony for 14 years i've never seen him like this and and when uh we first met  the marriage was still  the marriage was still uh the marriage sucked from day one believe me and day one and and then 
[00:38:00]  nothing against your ex but i never saw even in the early days with your ex you looking like you are  uh with jill that's all i'm gonna say i know it doesn't like to get too personal but all i'm  trying to say is that i've never seen this anthony before have you ever dated have you ever dated a  chick this hot in your life be honest have you ever dated a chick this hot in your life he said dated  just been just been yeah just dated just been with have you ever this hot you know just say no 
[00:38:30]  just say let's just put it this way he's never no gone out in public with so this is this this right  now this is the first time you've ever had a girl this hot be into you like publicly she's way  bobby she's way into him no i know that i'm not saying that i'm just saying this is the first time  you've ever had a chick this hot this into you for real all right right sure so you yeah bobby i know  what you're getting at but ant does uh very well for himself always has well no opie well listen 
[00:39:00]  you know hang on i know you're defending him because you want to defend him but the fact is  he just said i don't want to defend him i've been slamming him all morning he just said he's never  dated there is fair you've dated hot chicks yeah you know it's yeah i've dated hot chicks i've dated  you're dating your first okay well i was gonna answer your question to make myself feel real good  what are you talking about i haven't gone out with slobs my whole life there bobby i'm not saying  fours jesus christ i'm not saying that i'm saying this is joe's in a different categories 
[00:39:30]  bobby i saw anthony doing things and he was not i when he first started working working for me but  back then it sort of was like that i saw him doing things and he didn't have a name or any of that  crap and it's got a rap well it's got a rap about it won't be no i'm not saying that anthony doesn't  i'm not you're misunderstanding there might have been i'm not saying where he well you keep talking  because i don't i'm not saying that he's not he's a he's a hunk of garbage and he dated twos his 
[00:40:00]  whole life and all of a sudden this computer nerd came out of the closet with a hot chick i'm just  saying this is your first honest to god oh my god 10 right like unbelievable wow uh you know  being in a relationship yes this much that's what i mean then i'll say yes that's what i mean  yeah okay i'm just trying to understand that having a girl like that like you as much as you  like her is a is a it makes you want to do things you don't want to do that you always wanted to do 
[00:40:30]  that i don't want to do well you're making it sound like i'm doing things i don't want to do why  wouldn't i babysit for keith so keith and ang can go out have a nice night out so you've been lying  all these years about kids what it no no like bobby's sort of making a good point yeah i think  i think that's just been lying this whole time he's he's doing let me just say this whole show has  been he's doing one big lie he's always wanted to do secretly his whole life is babysit go to fun 
[00:41:00]  spot and and play skee-ball with a hot chick and a couple kids i think anthony you know see anthony's  very happy and that's and that's why he does the things he's doing now and there's nothing wrong  with that you see there's nothing wrong with babysitting when you're with somebody that you're  having fun with like that if i was there you know i've seen some of these fathers traipsing around  uh uh dave and busters and they're miserable she's she's an 11 keep just please add that in everything 
[00:41:30]  she's an 11 if she was a four and a half you wouldn't be having that much fun she's very pretty  she's an 11 she's a beautiful girl which adds to it i know it's fun walking around with a girl like  that a lot of people want to know how drunk you were when you were watching keith's kid we didn't  and were and were you drinking and driving while you were watching keith's kid i had that one beer  and i drew i drove with my hands 10 and 2 on the wheel how fast doing the speed limit according to jill

[00:42:30]  scare you a little bit don't they no i i've experienced a little bit right i've experienced  feel i've experienced feelings before this this feeling of caring it's it's it's scary to you isn't  it not at all no it's uh how does it feel to do something for somebody else yeah how does that feel  right to actually say yes and then come through with it without how does it feel to care for another  human being that doesn't have a uh uh want me to uh the email the whole thing to you tell you how 
[00:43:00]  it feels so maybe you can experience it someday i do it i do a lot of stuff for people and my friends  you do not oh absolutely stop it oh absolutely that's the problem with me is that i want my friends  to actually be friends like real people like to actually jim to call me on a weekend and hey what  are you doing today and you and jim norton are not friends how do you uh how do you fix the uh  apple thing on the computer and all right now listen i gotta go i got nine things going on  i'll help me later when i call you if i do later bye we all do hang out with a lot of selfish people

[00:47:00]  acknowledgement that i am a hero still thank you lydia i did want to give you your props for that plus  you know you are really very insightful regarding feelings and people's motivations  it's not that i'm it's not that i'm insightful i've hung out with anthony more than i have my  my own family in the last 14 years i kind of know the guy i i i think he always wanted to be happy and  in a really good solid relationship and if if the solid relationship continues he definitely is 
[00:47:30]  not against uh being married again and definitely not against having a kid even though he said the  complete opposite for the last 10 years i am being thank you put in this light just based on uh being  in a good relationship and babysitting and now i'm i'm i'm getting married and it's called being put in  the the good light yeah dude you're in love it's like you're in love you're in love for real this is  like real love something maybe you never had i don't know i don't know that much if you really love 
[00:48:00]  somebody then you wouldn't mind marrying them if you really love them you don't have kids with  them and explore that route all right lydia thank you really love them he was just test driving the  family all right test driving the family is that what it is taking the family out for a test drive  to see what it feels like uh i know what anthony's doing and uh they didn't have the kids when he got  pulled over to use them i know what my kids i have to get them back i know what anthony's doing and i'm  not uh i'm not going to allow it to happen see there's a new thing happening on this show  um sam is voicing like uh like these promos these like uh gossipy tmz type promo yeah and for a while 
[00:48:30]  there uh it was all about anthony yeah and i knocked him off the front page and i see what he's doing  today now with the kid thing and the kid angle oh he's hoping that he's he's back on the front page  well we all like our press don't we that's right but uh let's not forget that uh officially until  until sam uh writes a new one which will probably be in the next 15 to 20 minutes i'm on the front  page for being a hero say goodbye as the king and queen of long island trash are yesterday's news 
[00:49:00]  interest has completely fizzled and died on anthellini and a new story has captured the  minds and hearts of america opie of radio's the opie show took a break recently from telling jokes  to save a life and uh i want to say guys entertained me for quite a bit what's the matter  i i just was gonna say uh goodbye while sidekick anthony joked about guns and traffic girls opie 
[00:49:30]  courageously talked a listener down from the edge in one of radio's most emotional and uplifting  moments of all time tom let's uh let's uh call some people for you new york newspapers were calling  opie a hero this week even with the stress of carrying a radio show on his shoulders opie was  able to accept the compliment with modesty and class look what can i tell you you guys are you're  you're in front of greatness we're players you certainly are i'm a hero for the common man 
[00:50:00]  and you're lucky to be around me our sources are telling us that opie will spend the weekend  visiting children's hospitals and helping the homeless could a nobel peace prize be next as the hours  continue we'll keep you updated on the life and times of a real life superhero opie as for the  anthelini story meh  hey good morning to everybody it's the opie and anthony show bob kelly sitting in for jim norton 
[00:50:30]  doing a very good job today i guess we should get into some material finally uh now that we talked  about our weekends for the last uh hour i think that's material no i know i'm just just busting  uh i know we don't talk to a lot of golf fans but the tiger woods thing yesterday was pretty amazing  hobbling around the course with the bad knee yeah and uh he forced the playoff they're playing 18  holes today starting at noon to decide the u.s open shouldn't they just do one hole they usually do 
[00:51:00]  that sudden death but uh us opens a different format if you tie then you have to play uh a whole  round the next day and uh tiger needed a birdie on the 18th and he did it place went absolutely nuts  he had to sink a 12 foot putt to force the playoff i thought it was pretty cool so you know the old  guy too had to play the game of his life rocko mediate yeah he was about to win over tiger he would 
[00:51:30]  have been the oldest u.s open champion now he's gonna play a whole nother game yeah that's just  poor guy we'll see what happens you know what's gonna happen tigers hurt though yeah but 18 holes  if it was maybe one or two the guy would have a shot i think yeah i think if it was one or two tiger  would have a shot 18 holes though tigers was hobbling and he's pushing everything he's kind of  like the bill murray thing you know i think everything's gonna go off to the left right he'll  quit the game that's what's going on with tiger because i i don't think he can make the proper turn 
[00:52:00]  through the ball or something so he's uh his drives are going left they're going right he's he's  missing a a ton of shots i was talking to stunt break because he's a big golf fan uh a healthy tiger  that uh us open what wouldn't even be close he would have destroyed everybody but uh with the  with the knee that's still healing then you know these guys got a shot obviously  or rocco at this point they should do that at every tournament with him just smash him in the  knee just to make it fair do the nancy car again yeah just before we just smash my get my toe or my 
[00:52:30]  shin what do you want to hit so we got that going on and then everyone um on friday was uh just in  shock about tim russert uh dropping dead uh yeah heart attack 58 years old i gotta tell you the uh the  sunday morning programs i used to hate all of them until uh tim russert started doing it he he had a way  of doing that sunday morning program and i i watched it he was really really really good i never really  watched that but no surprise the guy was 58 overweight i mean it it happens yeah it happens

[01:03:30]  that night through the next day the the crap stories were just very i bet very impressive incredibly  impressive my one cousin rick uh was telling a story about how he had to uh use the long island uh  railroad bathroom on the way back to long island oh oh boy did he teach that uh that toilet a lesson  he beat the crap out of that toilet oh no and i was uh i was living on the upper west side at the 
[01:04:00]  time i could barely make it home in time a mere hour after eating all hell broke loose i'm so regular  i wake up boom i'm done i'm going i take a sip i'm done and i i came home last night as soon as i got  back to the house and went downstairs i was on the bidet for like 30 minutes the bidet yeah well that's  right you have that amazing turlet oh i was just kept pushing the button  cleaning it out but don't forget opie the big that you know the uh the hotels or the the made cars

[01:05:30]  feels like it's it aches and these places are dangerous yeah it feels like somebody punched  my heart like took my heart out punched it and then put it back in  a nice piece of plaque comes out right now oh god you guys would just let me lie there till  that you move over to xm the tim russert special that's that brings up a interesting  question let's say you needed mouth to mouth is there is there a person in the studio that would  would would do that for bob sam would run in here as quick as it would happen and put his little 
[01:06:00]  lion cub mouth right i forgot you have a crush on lion cub mouth i forgot that uh bob has a real  life crush actually actually i think i'm moving over to his brother now because sam has chest hair  that bugs me that makes it gay i don't i'm not gay of course not no no not the way you talk about  attractive brazilian men bringing you meat yeah but like he has chest hair i heard young sam and 
[01:06:30]  that that's gay i don't wanna bob you kiss me on the lips yeah but you kiss you didn't pull back  and he's got whiskers no he doesn't hey yeah he does look he just he's got a full you can grow a  full beard right i'm 24 years old can i see he's gotta say i'm 24 years old he's got one of those bumpy  beards well you know he's got a few of those yeah yeah what razor bumps yeah it's called rapper neck  what what uh what uh what does your chest look you get a lot of hair no let me no let me see no 
[01:07:00]  it's none of your business actually let me just say why i just just pull up let me just see i want  to see i'll turn away let me just see just for bobby go ahead the mic is in the middle of your chest  go over there there you go you can see from here i don't know what's wrong with his chest see see  see that little patch of hair talk see that little patch of hair he's in the little around his nipples  too which makes it he makes him manly he's not boy-like anymore can i put my shirt down yeah you 
[01:07:30]  you gotta you gotta throw him back now right bob yeah he's no good he's no good anymore he's  damaged goods no good he's got that little patch above his belly button which you're one of those  guys that like would would abuse a child and then have to face them when they get older and have hair  and be like hey how you doing uh i don't know what it is though pubes really do make a guy dirty  what you're talking about say you're at the beach and you saw a little kid running down the the 
[01:08:00]  beach a little boy naked and he's got nothing no no pubes and then all of a sudden you see like that  kid uh you can't just let if you have pubes it's dirty if you have no pubes it's kind of like hey  look at that little thing look at him justifying all right holy mother of god really pubes are the  pubes i don't really feel like saying goodbye to a 25 year broad uh broadcasting career because if  you're a sick mind bob i'm not saying that what are you talking about that's pedophilia crap i don't 
[01:08:30]  know what that means what he's just saying out of the studio your time is i do believe what he's  saying is that uh a lot of times parents will let their children run down the beach disrobed  right and it's not bad it's acceptable yeah like that but the second you show any type of maturity  happening where it's hair right or anything like that so this uh that it becomes dirty and you must  cover it up thank you so this comes from explaining it and saving me wait this comes from experience 
[01:09:00]  whatever that movement he did this this comes from experience then you see like parents with kids that  might be too old to still be naked think about that though you see kids at the beach and it's like  you know they're running around naked and it's not a real big deal nobody's nobody's saying anything  it's just okay whatever it's a little kid but as soon as he gets you know a couple whiskers when  you don't put that away i always thought it was kind of like uh creepy to see kids naked always yeah 
[01:09:30]  always always i think it's i mean i got a lot of nephews and nieces and every once in a while one's  running around naked and i always found it kind of creepy to be honest even though they're like still  very young and all that yeah and it's just that it's an innocent baby naked thing but still like  it's a little weird to me i wouldn't even take pictures at christmas with my little cousins on  my lap because i'm in like pajama bottoms and they're on my lap and i just get away just no no  pictures with me just sit on the floor i'll i'll tap the top of your head hey let's go to the fu line

[01:12:30]  877-212-ON-A i want to congratulate uh robert kelly for not being guilty of uh of those uh child  porn charges child porn charges what porn it's not me what that's not me what are you talking  about this isn't you 41 year old robert kelly leaves court an innocent man a jury found kelly not  guilty on 14 counts of child pornography congratulations robert why keeping that from 
[01:13:00]  everybody why would you keep that from everybody i just i didn't think it was now i know why he went  to the brazilian steakhouse yeah a little celebration huh robert yeah innocent doing  the congo line at the brazilian steakhouse celebrating right teflon pervert i went there  right after right after i went to chuck e cheese in the ball pit you tell me this isn't you 41 year  old robert kelly leaves court an innocent man a jury found kelly not guilty on 14 counts of child 
[01:13:30]  pornography a verdict six years in the making six years ago robert well you know it uh it happened  in the making he sat there uh and was thanking god all i heard the entire time with those 14 verdict  for being read was thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus  that is the robert kelly i have come to know  really all right robert well and it really bugs me too because you guys pressure me with hiring sam and 
[01:14:00]  all these little twinks you guys hire it really makes me nervous coming in that's unbelievable  man what are you gonna do that's the bullet there huh my friend yeah jesus saves prosecutors called  several people to testify but they did not subpoena the alleged victim it appears jurors felt the lack  of an actual victim weighed heavy in their decision prosecutors introduced the so-called r kelly sex tape  as exhibit one saying it showed kelly having sex with a young teenage girl kelly's defense team argued 
[01:14:30]  that it couldn't be him on the tape because of a distinguishable mole on the singer's back and they  say the man on that tape had no such mark oh my god you know what look yeah it's time to redo our  judicial system just time yeah why what do you uh you got a problem with that one  video evidence of him doing a 15 year old yeah and he gets away with it because  you're a mole 
[01:15:00]  what are you allowed to say it is so him in my humble opinion that's what i you know that's what i  thought it i've seen clips it's gotten to the point where it doesn't even matter if you're  innocent of the actual crime it's it's it matters how how good your lawyer is yeah what they can come  up with of course it's always been that way the facts don't matter anymore nope look at the oj 
[01:15:30]  but what did stump brain send me an email over the weekend he's like uh r kelly innocent of porn  charges russer doing the good you know the right thing and dying of a heart attack at 58 what did  you say just screw it all i said it doesn't make any sense to play by the rules yeah exactly  that's why anthony should have stepped on it when it got pulled over  just hit the gas hit the gas and just go  so i mean why didn't the victim uh come forward i don't know she did one of them actually said that uh 
[01:16:00]  uh didn't one of them actually say that it wasn't her in the video the the actual no one was in this  video yeah she said it wasn't me well maybe she was well taken care of behind the scenes maybe that  like i don't really want to testify something is maybe the embarrassment factor you know the it  happened i'm not going to deal with it thing she's probably older now she's not as hot she needed the  money six years ago right so she's what yeah 19 20 21 somewhere in that range how old was she 
[01:16:30]  uh at the time of the tape 15 15 i don't know my my humble opinion wow wow he's off the hook  robert kelly thank you thank you very much i actually get emails from africa actually people  supporting me in my case all right and i email back to them thank you very much  buy my new cd just the tip isn't that an insult to all god lovers that you're saying thank you jesus 
[01:17:00]  thank you jesus basically saying well jesus decided that there's nothing wrong with having  sex with minors yeah well that's what jesus has decided by saying thank you jesus thank you  well that's the best part about being catholic though as soon as you do something wrong you  just say look i'm sorry god and he forgives you and you're done until you get to that hell thing  no you say i'm sorry god you're out yeah but what if you do something against the um  you know the ten commandments or something well you know i'm sorry one of those big sins i'm  sorry nine murder nine hail marys for our fathers and a couple glory bees you can't just say i'm sorry 
[01:17:30]  you can that's what they tell you god forgives he forgives do something wrong right now no he forgives  that's it but what are you i don't i'm not buying that if you do something wrong and you go to  confession and you confess your sins you got to go to confession yeah you can't just do it on your  own can't just sit there and you know be standing over a hooker that you're stabbing to death and go 
[01:18:00]  i'm sorry god forgive me and then everything's fine i don't think you can do it during the act no  right when you're finished killing the hooker then you can say you can say i'm sorry okay i'm sorry god  and you're forgiven i'm in mistake yeah yeah if you're in a hospital on your deathbed and you see  that priest you know making his rounds you know just in case invite him in for a little talk  well yeah because that's a priest but i don't think you could just lay there and go oh boy  let me you know let me make my peace here i think you need like a walkie-talkie 
[01:18:30]  didn't you see evan almighty he hears you he hears all of us all at once it all happens  an email too if you want he does emails now that movie sucked which one the first one or the second  one i never bothered with the second one after seeing the first one all right hey uh  speaking of uh child molestation oh pervs got another guy with the perv switch this is one of 
[01:19:00]  our favorite things on this radio show you know most people can control it we all have the perv switch  we really do you see like uh like a girl walking down the sidewalk and you think in that instant what  you'd like to do or see or whatever and then next thing you know the moment passes you have passed  her by and you're you're you're you know walking into starbucks or your job well with other people  that perv switch goes off and all hell breaks loose they can't control it cannot control themselves  happens with uh usually with dentists yes they're in the you know the patient is in the chair uh 
[01:19:30]  they're they're uh anesthetized they're alone in the room with the dentist and the dentist is trying  to be professional he's there looking at a various bicuspid or an incisor and he's probing around in  the mouth or can i just add one or a dirty food pocket a food pocket and he's poking around in there  but then he looks and just sees her chest or something and just can't and the switch is breathing a 
[01:20:00]  little heavier because maybe she's got a little uh you know gas or uh whatever yeah she's just you  know maybe the uh the anesthesia is doing something that's right man and and and she's heaving they  call her chest is heaving a bit and and the the dentist will then because that perv switch it's like  a breaker a circuit breaker it goes off and he doesn't care about his 25 year career in dentistry he  just needs to open that blouse and become a pervert he doesn't care that his wife's in the lobby with 
[01:20:30]  the kids he's on the board of directors for a bunch of things he's got all that he's willing to throw  out the window because he's got to rip that blouse open and just so he's you know the bicuspid here  this looks okay i could fill that tooth this one is i gotta grab those i need those cans it just like  that snap gone most people can just go wow you know those are really attractive but but i have a 
[01:21:00]  wife kids i have a dental career i'm on the board of directors for many companies i'm a good samaritan  i'm charitable you hear that blouse i'm not gonna risk you hear that blouse making noises because it's  ready to burst yeah i'm trying to think you know because it's expanding with the breathing and then goes  back down breathing the buttons look like the rate of pop and then most people can just kind of put 
[01:21:30]  it away but once that breaker pops it's all over everything out the window yeah screw the wife and  kids i gotta touch those our latest scenario is now you do that and she's starting to wake up and you  gotta like you gotta it's like now i gotta choke her no you gotta you're trying to dress her quickly  as she's waking up a little too uh a little too fast for your real life and and the and the assistant  is at the door oh i got the x-ray doctor doctor oh why is the door locked in in in in sheer terror 
[01:22:00]  you realize you've done that stupid things with a button where you've buttoned one lower than the  button hole so so her shirt is twisted oh geez i gotta start over she walks out with your t-shirt  on anyway we have a so there's a button that happens like if a guy's going through the meatpacking  district perf switch we call someone someone like you could walk by a shemale and not want to talk to 
[01:22:30]  her and pick her up but some guys are just like i gotta have it uh that would probably qualify for  for someone that's into that because it would be again you know chancing throwing your entire life  away if it's a married guy and stuff yeah it's the career it's the perv switch we all have perv switch  well there's a doctor out there on long island and um you know he's got a bathroom and he's got the the  hot patients going in there and i'm sure as a doctor you're thinking wow it's right on the other 
[01:23:00]  side of that door she's getting into that robe right now that door is so thin yet so thick  and then he goes back to like anyway i got some x-rays to look at yeah i got work to do i got  work to do shake it off shake it off but not this doctor out on long island that purse which got the  best of them dr vincent pacienza is accused of installing a hidden camera disguised as an air  purifier in the bathroom of manhasset cardiology look you know what you're not a man if you haven't 
[01:23:30]  thought of doing this a camera yes if you thought of it just thought i'm just saying  i think every guy has had this thought it was a fantasy as a kid  um in school to be able to get a camera into the locker room i'm i'm talking maybe not even  necessarily cameras but like you know peepholes especially yeah drilling your own peepholes uh  to look into girls locker rooms and stuff yeah yeah we didn't have the camera technology that they uh 
[01:24:00]  right they have now right god it's it would be so easy to get a camcorder into the girls locker room  now yeah one of those little tiny things you place it somewhere uh and place it somewhere you  get your own lock you go in after hours you figure out which locker is is the perfect viewpoint if you  set up your nice camera and then you lock that up like it's one of the girls locker yeah perfect  done let's go maybe even uh pay a female accomplice to help you out oh that would be strong and that that 
[01:24:30]  way you don't have to worry about getting caught going in there a lesbo get a lesbo so it's good  for both of you yeah you can both sit there and chuckle all right listen we got a lot of high school  kids that listen yeah what are you doing that's what you got to do you got to befriend the uh the  girl at school that has the hair maybe a little too short yeah the one that's wearing the big uh  sweatshirts at an early age the ones that were wearing looking like uh she's still into grunge short hair 
[01:25:00]  and maybe a nantucket sweatshirt she yeah she's your target she is a lesbo she likes the  accomplice she likes to you know lick the oh yes so you got to befriend her and then friend her  and then you got to work out this scheme where she brings the camera into the locker yeah she gets  the camera yeah gets the locker brings it in gets the perfect vantage point usually somewhere pointing  toward the showers i would think uh yeah between the lockers and the showers so you've got to 
[01:25:30]  get a view of both and uh send the uh tapes to 111 57 let's go back to the perv doctor out there in  long island dr vincent pacienza is accused of installing a hidden or you know what chris from  virginia this is a character we haven't done in a very long time i don't even know if uh if she's in  today uh this chris suggests that you befriend the dyke gym teacher oh that's risky have you ever 
[01:26:00]  heard the dyke gym teacher robert that's risky i don't know so damn it do we have a whistle oh  of course we have a whistle can you stunt brains whistle though it's got stunt brain all over it  do you have a brand new what whistle he's not going to use the stunt brain whistle no  i didn't use this one this was just handed out at the strike seriously yeah yeah he used it once i  remember when we have a uh that's the red whistle when oh he he swears i like the unsanitary whistle 
[01:26:30]  let me smell the one they just took out of his computer bag it's fresh that's been there since  the writer's strike it's scaring me yeah but you're doing a lot of new things these days you're holding  uh kids hands and any teeth marks on it saying i love you and uh what i'm not holding it makes  sound like i'm holding the kids hands and telling them i love them jesus the hell where are you oh  good point there should have been a a comma or a that's a weird oh that's the worst whistle 
[01:27:00]  awful whistle there stunt brain um and i we did this whole uh we finally had a discussion about growing  up and why didn't we notice that the the female gym teacher was always a dyke always yeah every  single time and she she had like a dream job because she she would she's allowed to go into the uh the  girl's locker room because she can herd the girls anywhere she wants to and get them into any various 
[01:27:30]  states of undress that uh she feels necessary and because she's an authority figure at the school no one's  gonna question her motive job dream job it's a dream job that's why like in my high school i i  better not even say which high school but the gym teacher 45 year career why would you ever leave  45 years of just looking why would you ever leave every year they bring in a new batch that's the same

[01:35:30]  not allowed to promote so okay good luck you figure that one out now thanks  where were we dice suicide notes oh yeah that guy with the uh  dyke gym teacher with his uh hacky uh his hacky suicide note  i just thought the rhyming thing was a little odd i'm sure he was under pressure though he was  about to he was about to pull the trigger and and put his brains in the back of his wall 
[01:36:00]  little boy blue his brains out oh  you didn't like that it rhymed yeah no i like the rhyming you didn't like that huh  let's say hi to bill in cleveland good morning to cleveland by the way it's been a while how are you  bill yeah good afternoon guys what's up no it's it's mornings there now oh it is okay let's screw 
[01:36:30]  maxwell hey um hold on bill you don't know hold on bill you don't know we're live in the morning  in cleveland now oh no not at all that's wonderful anyways hey um back in high school when i was a  freshman um we had a gym teacher that was actually a freshman uh football coach also so he must have  loved the 13 14 year old kids coming in there but um every time after gym class and then also  after football practice we would uh be taking showers and things like that and for some reason 
[01:37:00]  our football coach would just love to find points of helping us in the actual showers what what what  what could he possibly do to help you in the shower just things things that he observed on the football  field um to you know just different things like hitting the hole properly you know on your 
[01:37:30]  no well he yeah hitting the hole properly yeah of course exactly and uh you know following your  blocks and things like that but yeah i'll tell you what we make you line up in the uh in the shower  like your training hernia test time all right hernia test time try to knock me down  no but he he liked this one our uh quarterback especially because he always go up to him a lot  but he was dreamy yeah but we we mentioned that fact in uh one of our english classes it was 
[01:38:00]  two of our football players that were in there we mentioned it and about now 15 minutes after the  class ended our principal calls us in the office and pretty much reads us the riot act that we  shouldn't um you know bring up facts that are or actually bring up things that aren't facts and  you know pretty much we could get the tension and if this teacher wanted to um bring us you know to 
[01:38:30]  it they could bring us or bring us up for slander because you know we were saying things in front of  i just i just got bored with him yeah i don't know what it was about bill but he was driving me nuts  it's all right the whole shower thing that was good part of the story then he just dude let me uh  it's funny when i actually do it let me tell you what's uh what's going on uh there was a time  especially when we were all growing up that the whole gay thing yeah it wasn't it wasn't an open 
[01:39:00]  thing i think it i think it sucks to be uh a gay teacher in this day and age now because in the  70s when we were going to school late 70s uh you could get away with murder because no one's going  to acknowledge that the gym teacher is gay yeah you know you know what i mean but i'm sure now if  they're hiring like a new gym teacher they're kind of taking a closer look do you think they do that 
[01:39:30]  or or just that well they can't officially but let it go the way it is they can't officially but  there's ways of getting getting the info out oh getting the info all right girls  panty check panty check in the locker room come on girls inside  gonna climb the rope now girls let's go climb the rope in your skirts without your panties on  i'm the teacher i get to say whatever i want to do and you have to do it and you have to have to do 
[01:40:00]  it i want you to slide down as fast as you can on my face oh god wobby i'll catch you bobby wobby sorry i'll  hold the rope for all the girls if someone needed to hold the rope at the bottom that big knot  the big knot at the bottom even tie that thing yeah that was real smart as a kid having a huge  knot that you slide into it i don't know who took showers at school i i just saw that was in movies 
[01:40:30]  i never took a shower at school shower time girls i know it's only five minutes into gym but  some of you have worked up quite a sweat shower time all day showers just gonna lock you in the  shower for the entire period till the school boiler runs out of hot water  what a field day for her but i mean it's it's more open to be gay now but i'm i'm just saying back 
[01:41:00]  then even even if people had their suspicions no one was willing to talk about it so you as the  dyke gym teacher you got away with murder no one was gonna like accuse you of anything no they must  have loved it i had a hot gym teacher that used to actually have sex with my uncle's friend while we  were in gym she was smoking hot and she used to wear really tight tight gray gym sweatpants really 
[01:41:30]  that she'd roll over like flash dance at the top all right that looks so they'd be a little tight  near the crotch area and uh yeah okay bob and uh i i everybody was in love with her i mean she was  smoking hot and she i found out years later i talked to the guy that used to date her and he used to take  her in he used to come in all the time hey what's up you know and he would take her into her office and  just beat the hell out of her while we were out there doing jumping jacks playing dodgeball she'd be in 
[01:42:00]  there just getting oh really oh yeah wow which makes it even hotter now knowing that that was  happening in there all right girls you all in the shower i'm gonna have to check and make sure you  know how you know how to wash i go oh my god  oh okay girls keep there's the soap make sure your soap up there so you over there make turn around let 
[01:42:30]  me make sure you're soapy  holy mother of god they've all developed quite well over the past year i gotta snap out of it 
[01:43:00]  wow that was a long summer all right rinse off time girls rinse off time that's it get all that  soap off of your breasts  you know she marches into the locker room with good intentions of course she does with a strong  whistle all the best intentions come on let's go quick all right ladies take it off and then she 
[01:43:30]  notices that one uh girl is in the shower one guy yeah yeah all right take those off uh take it  shower time girls let's go  oh jesus  i have the best job in the world  let's say out of dave uh losing our mind on long island dave 
[01:44:00]  dave you there dave hey hey hey what's up guys what's up but listen um i want to i might  have gone to the same uh high school as uh as anthony hawkfields high school in greenland  uh i went to john h glenn opie went to harborfields  i'm a harborfields high school graduate yes okay well anyway um in middle school in eighth  grade we used to have like morning intramurals right and each morning when we go into the 
[01:44:30]  locker room we'd i'd i'd see my social studies teacher and i guess he'd do his morning workouts  and he'd shower in the boys locker room and he'd come out with his hog hanging out with all these  little boys all these little boys to see and i i'd be like dude is is is this right like  this is no it's not no you you were smart enough to know that no that's not right but  that's what i'm getting at they they know how to get around because you know a guy showering in 
[01:45:00]  the guy's locker room should be okay yeah but if you're if you're a gay teacher i don't know if  it's okay but no one's going to call him out on that fact because he would just go what i'm just  showering and what's the big deal yeah well you're you're revealing yourself as 12 year old old boys  so uh i don't know buddy what does he get away with being able to be naked in front of 12 year old  boys all of a sudden all of a sudden you're a shark in a locker room filled with chum yeah 
[01:45:30]  yeah just going around picking them off something you know all right dave thank you we got to get to  the uh hidden camera found in the doctor's uh office out there oh yeah we went off on a 20  minute tangent here's the story finally dr vincent pacienza is accused of installing a hidden camera  disguised as an air purifier in the bathroom of his manhasset cardiology practice  a place where patients both changed and used the toilet no not that's the pacienza can't be 
[01:46:00]  lillian orafina runs the flower shop next door on plan dome road she's been pacienza's patient for  six years this is an upstanding man i mean he is one of the best cardiologists around he saved my  husband's life untold times well then then stop being ungrateful yeah saved your husband's life  then you stand in front of the air purifier and do squats that's right you better just roll in front of  the air purifier i thought it's an air purifier too god listen to this lady she's so ungrateful 
[01:46:30]  the guy saved your your husband's life numerous times untold times that's right that's what she said  you do your stretches yeah get in that bathroom investigators say a couple of the doctor's  employees found a bill from a spy store the spy store.com they got suspicious and called police  rats we have detected the device we've taken the device we did a search for the doctor's office  as well as his home pacienza pled not guilty to second degree unlawful surveillance today his lawyer 
[01:47:00]  says they'll go to trial and clear the good name of a doctor who's been practicing for 25 years pacienza  is free to continue seeing patients as a patient if he wanted to see my chest hello can he not see my  chest why would he have to have a camera in the bathroom because it's not hot why would he have to  have a camera in the bathroom yeah this is not if you're examining somebody it takes the hotness  out of it when you start talking about like how you how you're having like uh you know chest pain 
[01:47:30]  yeah and it's like excuse me take your uh a top off i'm a cardiologist i need to see your chest now  i'm just gonna scrap one out right here also can you mind like maybe the video portion is the stuff  he takes home and uses to uh take care of business that was a dumb broad ah she didn't get it  doesn't understand the whole she doesn't understand porn and what and how it's used by men uh hitting  cameras voyeurism very very hot and sexy and the pause button rewind yeah rewind there's always that 
[01:48:00]  one spot you really get you that you gotta i gotta you gotta time it right that's what's gonna perfect  timing i want that to be the time one two that is a good one and then you work up to that point and  then you go like let me do that again yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna waste it right now i'm gonna  do this about 25 times yeah i want my hand to be like i just dug snails  let's say hi to john smithtown john 
[01:48:30]  dude this guy's demographic as a cardiologist in nassau  yeah he's probably getting the old jew broads no pieces of asses  all right why you have to wreck our fantasy john yeah i'm wondering like if he's a cardiologist  up there on plan dome road yeah he's that's uh john's right this guy's this guy in the end  you got to think he's a sick one because yeah you know you're not looking at any uh skirts  no oh doctor oh my doctor right i don't understand if he's wonderful but i don't understand how long 
[01:49:00]  does it take to be a doctor oh my god how many years it's got to be three four years of college  perhaps more than that anthony how many do you think 12 to 18 it's uh yeah for a cardiologist he  had to do another no just doctor that's four years of med school i want to be a doctor seven years after  college so it's seven years after college after college so all right if you're gonna there's a lot  of uh youngsters listening to us right now and they want to be doctors someday after high school 
[01:49:30]  you're gonna be in school for another 11 years wow why would you pick double high school pretty much  the only field you should be going into say that is gynecology if you're gonna suffer through 11 years  more of schooling yeah why would you choose to be a foot doctor a heart doctor maybe you want to help  and ask doctor but yeah the fact you're gonna ruin it though if you're gynecologist every single  time you know something you're desensitizing yourself to an area that uh shouldn't be desensitized to 
[01:50:00]  and you're actually seeing the most atrocious yeah yeah awful ones on the planet and you can't you  have to look right into the eye of the beast every day isn't you know high school pep smear day  uh but i laugh at both of you i didn't hear one chuckle out of him did you not one well then laugh  at us do we have uh clam lovers here today what is that i love a good every once in a while you get 
[01:50:30]  a bad clam right spit it out on the plate do you stop eating clams my friends yeah for a while  yeah for a lot like around six to eight months yeah i don't get clams so i'm thinking gynecologist  sure there's gonna be those days where it's not gonna be pretty just make believe you're you're  an ass doctor that day oh god actually and then you're gonna get back to the to the to the fresh  nice clams again and fresh you know if you like clams you're gonna get a bad one every once in a while 
[01:51:00]  no big deal you got to brush it off and you move right on to the next fresh one there is do you  understand though we've never seen it live we've all very rarely maybe but mostly never us three  right here have never seen the worst that are out there and there's a lot of bad ones we get we choose  what we see my girl does the waxings the brazilian waxes right i talked to her about some of the she's

[01:55:30]  yeah so she got a phone call yesterday from the secretary who found the bill and said the doctor  installed the air freshener himself and then told all the women in the office to use just that bathroom  he's got two bathrooms and he said hey you guys just use that bathroom and tell all the men to just  use the other bathroom oh there you go he set up like a men's room in an old ladies room just to  keep it safe this is obviously what paul uh is saying we have no idea if it's true that's uh quite 
[01:56:00]  interesting there paul thank you all right schmoopy all right no that's that's schmoopy uh speaking of  schmoopy we have an anthelini update really yeah sam is voicing these these fine promos in the tmz  style very tmz we're all looking for press on this show not not out there in the real world  in within the show in show land and within the show we're all looking to be you know 
[01:56:30]  the big cheese the head honcho big cheese and numero uno hombre and my whole hero thing from last week  has put me on the top oh it did it it sure did you heard the last one he did with that we got an anthelini  update from uh sam well just when we thought the anthelini train had completely run its course  interest is starting to pick up again as the op hero story becomes a distant and forgettable  memory it seems like after this weekend anthony has gone from dating kids to caring for them why 
[01:57:00]  wouldn't i want to uh yeah help a buddy out because you don't help anyone and you hate kids there's two  reasons the anthelini express babysat for kumia manservant keep the cops two children this  weekend they started the day taking in a screening of kung fu panda  what what after that they moved on to an equally emasculated fun filled time at chuck 
[01:57:30]  e cheese it's appropriate to be deep kissing jill in front of the drill-o-matic machine by the way  after hugs kisses and sticky fingers anthelini and the kids parted ways but not before anthony was  wished a happy father's day anthony is reportedly getting ready to turn in his guns trade in the  shelby for a minivan and is even teaching keith's kids to talk just like their uncle anthony  stay tuned as the anthelini saga either gets juicier or peters out slowly 
[01:58:00]  moving right along with the opian anthony show i want to thank bob kelly for helping us out today  doing a great job robert kelly live.com for all info about robert kelly uh i want to bring back uh  the old bit what did we learn on the opian anthony show whether we do it today or tomorrow but let's  try to bring that back keep it educational absolutely we learn stuff every day on this radio show  eight seven seven two one two on a we got jimmy and boston want to say hi to everybody listening 
[01:58:30]  on bcn go celtics go don't worry about last night uh i told you last week this thing is wrapped up  beginning of the end when over says that lakers beat the celts last night i think you know that  by now celts lead the series three to two uh jimmy what do you got all right when i was in  guys you there yeah oh yeah all right so when i was in med school one of the things you learned  about was uh sometimes women can grow teeth in really weird places that aren't supposed to be  there but one of the places they can grow them is in their vagina and it's called vagina dentata 
[01:59:00]  okay that is bizarrely i cannot believe that what if the dentist hold on hold on hold on  it's real it's i promise what iraq will you get back to your post iraq abandons his post a lot  stop socializing what are you doing what are you doing because i really we need you at this point  because i want to make sure that they didn't dump out because if they did then we got to re-explain  what he was trying to say because this is extremely interesting because i've heard about this in the 
[01:59:30]  past i never heard of this i've heard of it it's called uh don't say it's called uh blank dentata  you should be able to say that you should be able to say that that word vagina dentata  yeah it has something to do let me just say this just in case something to do with teeth  yeah it's it's because now i've heard certain tumors can grow teeth and hair heard i've seen that 
[02:00:00]  yeah that's true now now is this that kind of problem where maybe there's a growth or a tumor that  grows uh teeth no no it's not a tumor it's a it's a medical condition it's very very rare but  there are even like they made a movie out of it though the stump brain just uh uh wrote me a note  that's right the movie bombed but they did make a movie about the phone are you trying to tell me  wait a minute are you trying to tell me that instead of some kind of tumor where teeth are just flying  out of anywhere they are actually set up like actual teeth no it's got to be no no it's got to be 
[02:00:30]  like they're not there's no gums they're not set up like teeth but they they are growing in there  it's got to be like it's got to be uh west virginia teeth there's one here one there one nothing  yeah i thought it was funny but english graveyard teeth i mean that's a little bit freaking out  which one do you want to use which analogy yeah um that'd be great for the dentist who had a sexual  addiction ah the movie's called teeth by the way yes thank you nothing on that yeah i don't believe 
[02:01:00]  this at all we'll get dr steve on the phone he's our resident doctor he'll tell us just punch up uh  what's up with vagina dentata is steve listening right now because we could use his knowledge  uh thank you jimmy yeah no problem guys all right i think i think the guys uh that'd be great to get  one of those in here let's go to jake i'm not believing that at all jake yeah jay hey jay  hey guys how you doing good i i saw that actually at the bodies exhibit that was at south street 
[02:01:30]  stefort in manhattan awful they showed the teeth in the in the absolutely absolutely like the guy  said it wasn't like a set of choppers it was well i guess it was in a way but uh it was like one  and a half teeth just kind of embedded in this tissue that was you know part of a preserved vagina  it was the most awful thing i've ever seen in my life so so it can't eat it can't eat a carrot  no no of course not it might nicky a little bit but no all right thank you jay that was a joke opie  that would be the joke part of it of course not i know that what's wrong with you all right 
[02:02:00]  so jesus all right it's like we're doing a new show i know it's a comedy show not funny car crash  all right so i blew one all right one all right i've been i've been close to brilliant today  all right you have to do a spit take you bastard  it gave me a little  yeah i'm getting reports that this this is false come on it's an urban myth

[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Testing, testing, testing, testing. 
[02:16:30]  Testing?  What are we testing?  It's a whole new world.  I didn't study.  It's a whole new world today, ladies and gentlemen.  Why?  What happened?  We're getting close to a merger.  Oh, sure we are.  Oh, sure we are.  Now, are we?  Both stocks are up in pre-trading.  Who knows?  I'm trying to get Logan on the phone to talk merger.  But he's not getting back to me.  But he's not getting back to me.  That's a sign that he's extremely busy. 
[02:17:00]  Busy being fired?  God, I hope he makes the cut.  God, I hope he makes the cut.  Yeah, that'd suck if we...  Because we have a lot of haters over at Sirius Satellite.  I wonder why.  And Logan, we love him.  We beat him up pretty good, but we love Eric Logan.  He's kept us from blowing ourselves up again.  That is the truth.  Oh, yeah?  I think so.  We finally decided to listen to somebody, and he was the guy we decided to listen to. 
[02:17:30]  That was silly on our part.  Before that, we never really listened to anybody.  Nah, you're just...  It's silly to make that type of joke today.  I'm teasing.  Think of all the guys...  He's the bestest.  ...that we could have listened to over the years.  I know.  And chose not to.  And I still think it was the right decision.  Yep.  To not listen to anyone until Eric Logan came along.  Yeah, I hope he makes the cut.  He better make the cut.  So, our lives will be tougher if he doesn't make the cut.  Let's just put it that way. 
[02:18:00]  Bob Kelly made the walk over to XM Satellite Radio, and he loves the fact that we could...  We just moved our entire, like, what do you call this, console?  Oh, the console goes up and down.  Up and down.  And I felt like having it a little lower today.  So, Anthony pushed the old switch, and it went...  But does it go back up?  Oh, sure.  Like, electronically?  Oh, yeah, watch.  Go ahead, Ant.  Show him.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me get to the button over here.  Here, this one's up.  This is what Logan did for us. 
[02:18:30]  Dude, that's just fucking awesome.  How high does it go?  I don't know.  Let's see.  Let's break it.  I don't want it to get stuck all the way up.  That would suck.  We'll look like...  Higher.  Higher.  How high does this thing go?  Let's just do the show like this.  Like we're midgets.  I'm starting to feel like...  Oh, this is weird.  I'm starting to feel like the kid at dinner at...  It's fucking on.  What happens if we go too high?  Keep going.  Just keep going.  Oh, no.  I'm going to see if I can leave my arms on the table.  All right.  We're going to pull a bunch of wires out, I bet. 
[02:19:00]  Hold on.  Bobby, stay there.  I can see Opie's eyes.  I can barely see it.  I can't see it.  I can't see anybody.  Wait, wait.  Let me get Bobby's eyes freaking out.  I can't see.  I can't see.  Bobby, put your eyes over the console.  Let's do the show like this.  Yeah, we should do the show like this.  This is retarded.  It's non-stopping.  What if it falls off and breaks all of our knees?  I could go under now.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, let's do the show from under the console.  Well, this is retarded.  Does it go up high?  Let's see.  Steve, how high does it go?  Keep going.  It's not supposed to go that high.  It's not supposed to go that high.  Look at it.  Is it still going?  Is it still going?  I think it stopped.  That's it.  That's it.  Oh, my God.  I'm holding it up.  That's how high it goes.  How high is this?  I like this.  You can see it.  All right.  We'll do the show like this.  But I can't see you fuckers.  I can't see anything. 
[02:20:00]  I can't hit my sound effects.  I can't hit anything.  This is like, where are you?  Raise your hand.  I'm over here.  What's up?  Where are you?  Look how high up this is.  This is ridiculous.  This is stupid.  Let's keep it this high for Ron and Fez.  What the?  That would be funny.  Take the key home.  There it is.  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, we can see each other under the table now.  Hey, what's going on?  Look at all these wires.  What is it? 
[02:20:30]  Let's just start pulling some out.  All right.  Randomly.  All right.  Ready?  Let's play.  You're going to play wire roulette?  Yeah.  It's like whoever takes us off the air loses.  I've taken this plug out.  $100 a man.  Whoever takes us.  Look at Mars.  It's going, no.  $100 a man.  Whoever takes us off the air first.  I will start with this plug.  Oh, no.  What does that do?  No, no, no.  All right.  I took out a monitor.  You took out a monitor?  You took out the lid.  You took out the lid.  Your turn, man. 
[02:21:00]  I hope I don't unplug the thing that keeps it from going up and down.  All right.  You take out something.  All right.  That looks like a hot one right there.  Oh, that's a weird plug.  I'm going for that next.  That looks like a hot one right there.  What is this thing?  All right.  Take it out.  All right.  That's two-hander.  Ah!  Whoa.  What does that do?  Wow.  That's important.  Oh, that makes it go up and down?  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  I better put that back.  All right.  What about this plug?  No, that's it.  All right.  Let's play.  What does this plug do?  Ready? 
[02:21:30]  Did you put that one back in?  I have to.  All right.  All right.  Let's take this plug out next.  Oh, no.  That's important.  No.  All right.  What did that do?  We don't even know what that plug does?  Then get rid of it.  All right.  Take this.  This plug just hangs here.  But you need a lot of plugs.  That way it looks important.  All right.  I like that one right there.  The big silver one right there.  Where?  Right there. 
[02:22:00]  I know.  That's tempting.  Which one?  The big silver one.  You know, you start ripping stuff out of that, you know we're going off the air.  Well, Logan better call us.  How about this one?  Oh.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, there's a bunch over here.  Take that thing out.  That weird white thing.  This?  Yeah, that's a weird white plug.  That's an internet cable, though.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, look at these.  Oh, yeah.  Take one of those out. 
[02:22:30]  Let's just start unplugging these.  All right.  Take that out.  What's that?  What did that just do?  Do a replay.  Oh, my recent thing.  What about this?  And then what about this?  Uh-oh.  That made a popping sound.  What about this?  There's three more plugs out over here.  Oh, no.  You put all the plugs out?  Yeah.  And this one?  And this one?  Mars is running around trying to plug them.  We unplug them.  I'm completely under the fucking console. 
[02:23:00]  What is this?  It's dangerous to be under there.  What is this, though?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You just turned the entire power strip off.  What about that one, Obi?  Right there.  That big black box.  This thing?  No, the one right here.  Right behind it.  Right there.  This is a black box in case we crash.  This one right here.  It records everything.  Where?  What about...  Don't shake too much.  This one right here.  You guys are crazy for being under there.  No, don't pull that. 
[02:23:30]  This computer.  Oh, it's my computer.  I need that.  Put that back up.  Dude, this thing better not fall on my head.  I know.  You've got to watch out.  I feel like a mechanic.  All right.  Well...  Oh, you're on a creeper under a truck.  Oh, that can't be good.  What did you just pull out?  I've never seen a plug like this before.  Ow!  How was that?  What happened?  It sparked?  Yeah, it sparked a little. 
[02:24:00]  You ass.  Here, come on under here.  Too bad Jimmy's not here.  We can play Monster Rain.  Oh, yeah.  Quick.  Get under the console.  Oh, it's going to rain, Bobby.  Come on under.  Whip your dick out.  What else can we unplug?  I don't know.  Let's just start kicking stuff.  No, don't kick.  I hope that thing comes down because it's really...  Dude, I'm stuck.  All right.  Hey, Mars.  What would happen if I unplugged two of the jacks that lift this up? 
[02:24:30]  How many jacks are there?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  It stops working.  All of them will stop working?  I can't tip this whole thing over?  What?  That would be fun to pull out like three jacks and then start making it go down so the whole  thing tips over?  That's a good idea.  Jesus.  I like that idea.  There's one right here.  What's a, uh, what's a thanks, uh, Thans, oh, Thans web.  Oh, boy.  That's sad.  You're going to have to replace that.  Thans no longer here. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Get out from under.  We'll, we're going to, we're going to go back down.  All right.  Bring it back down.  I hope it works.  I hope this slams down and breaks our kneecaps.  All right.  Oh, nice.  Going, going down.  All right.  Let's see who moves their knees first.  The eagle has landed.  Let's see who moves first.  Let's go.  Oh, you're fat.  You got more cushion.  I just got to make sure that the shelf doesn't hit on the bottom.  I know the rules.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah.  You don't want that to hit.  I didn't realize I heard that.  Sorry.  Okay.  We're good. 
[02:25:30]  Watch your hands.  That's it.  That's all good.  Now we're good.  No, you don't want to go much lower or else the cabinet here hits and the whole thing  breaks.  It goes through the floor and we end up in the Steinway building on top of pianos.  That was fun.  That was fun for us.  You know, fuck the listeners.  You know what I felt like?  The kid in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when he's on a date at that table.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  When he's really high and we couldn't see.  She will have the knock worst.  Yeah.  All right.  That was fun.  Anyway, Bob Kelly is here.  We're back in proper broadcast position.  Settings.  Our settings.  Bobby just casually mentions as we sit down to do the XM show that Abe Lincoln was gay.  Yeah.  Where did you get that info?  I didn't even question it.  I just went, oh, yeah.  I started making Abe Lincoln gay jokes.  I just made, I read a biography on Abe Lincoln and there's people that say it's not true 
[02:26:30]  that, but there's people that did a couple of biographies that said that he actually,  his best friend for four years, they slept in the same bed together.  Doesn't make you gay, does it?  Well, he used to sign his letters to him for ever yours speed.  Yeah, but they used to sign their letters really weird back then anyway.  Truly yours.  That's what people.  They were just too formal.  That's what people said, but there's also people that said that his, the people that  knew the relationship said they were, their relationship was very lavender. 
[02:27:00]  Lavender.  That's what they called it.  The gay color.  Yeah, I guess back then that's how you say fags.  You know, where the fuck did signing a letter yours truly come from?  Because that sounds really kind of gay.  Like, look, I'm, I'm yours truly.  Right.  Who the fuck would write that to someone you don't know?  Because you usually sign that.  You know, here you're writing to a business or a company.  It's like, okay, yours truly.  Right.  But if you really break it down, that's pretty gay. 
[02:27:30]  I'm yours.  Truly.  Truly.  That Abe Lincoln.  I say we unplug stuff until Elo calls us.  We were trying that.  I think everything else is pretty secure.  We want to know if he's surviving the merger.  We, we sure hope so.  Do you hope, uh, Wicklund survives the merger?  Who?  Anyway, uh, so Abe's, uh, gay there, huh, Bobby? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, now where'd you, uh, you, I love how I'm the B-plot.  Did you, you're the B-plot?  There's an A-plot going on, I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.  But I'm the B-plot that you guys keep going to.  No, you're like the scroll that goes, uh, you know, at the bottom of CNN.  On the news, yeah.  You're the scroll.  The main story is some guy named Wicklund.  Right.  Exactly.  What, uh, what show were you watching that showed you that on the show?  It was a, I was, uh, it was a book.  And, uh, yeah, sometimes, that's why I love Google, because you can hear a little rumor 
[02:28:30]  and then Google it, and then just there'll be 20 pages of Abe Lincoln sucking cock.  That I couldn't, uh, imagine.  Uh, well, people were gay back then.  Bearded, fucking.  We think people gay started in 1970?  Yeah.  It sure explains that really tall hat of his.  So he could put it in his lap?  Yeah.  When the men are in the room?  Well, when he's doing whatever he did in Congress.  Well, you guys didn't know this. 
[02:29:00]  Among men.  He shaved.  He could hide his boner.  The reason why.  His boner.  The reason why he didn't have a mustache is because he kept getting cum in it.  That's why he shaved the mustache off.  I'm not believing Abe Lincoln was gay.  How do you say boner?  Like, I say boner, Cole.  Booner.  How do you say boner?  That's cool.  I say it like this.  I say boner.  Boner.  Boner.  I just don't know how to say it.  I say hard on.  I like to say cock.  Of course you do. 
[02:29:30]  Cock.  All right, guys, listen.  Um, we just had the George Takai story.  He's getting married today because, um, gay marriage is legal in California.  I love a big cock in my ass.  Could you get married as a goof?  Yes!  As a goof?  Oh.  Like, two guys.  Like, say you just got Iraq and Steven said, go get married as a goof.  Yep.  Could they do it?  Yeah, but then it's fucking legally binding.  What's wrong with you?  Of course you can.  Of course you can.  Like, straight couples get married as a goof all the time. 
[02:30:00]  As a goof?  Citizenship and all that?  So you'd have to get a divorce.  You'd have to go to divorce court and literally get a divorce.  They would have to get a divorce.  Gay people have to go through all the same shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Regular straight couples go through.  Now they could suffer just like us.  I love when communities do that joke.  Oh, I get it.  Because, you know.  Go ahead.  Get gay.  Get married.  I don't care.  I don't care.  You don't know what you're in for.  Let them suffer like we do.  Oh.  And then the audience like, class, class.  Now gay people are going to know how I feel. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, jeez.  I get it.  Because I'm miserable too.  Yeah.  And now they'll be.  Then they go this route.  I wish I could be gay.  I'd stand around watching football sucking cock.  Oh, God.  Oh, those gay people.  Speaking of comedians, Patrice killed at comics over the weekend.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are?  And I want to thank for not giving me one single thing for free at comics. 
[02:31:00]  Wow.  Thank you.  I just want to thank comics.  It was my pleasure to take out my Amex on numerous occasions as I was seeing Patrice on Saturday night.  No, really.  Nothing.  Thank you for the privilege of handing over my credit card over and over and over again.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You didn't pay for tickets.  That's the only thing I didn't pay for.  So you get in and then they charge you for everything.  Oh, they were happy. 
[02:31:30]  I showed up.  And oh, thanks for coming by.  Thanks for supporting our club.  Thanks.  Because of you and Anthony, we saw a fine number of tickets being sold.  Well, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Now pay.  Thank you.  Got to tell you, I know a nice place down there in Times Square.  Only reason I mention it.  Doesn't ever, doesn't ever charge me a dime.  What's that?  Is that the lovely?  Caroline's. 
[02:32:00]  Caroline's.  They don't charge you anything.  The wonderful people down in Caroline's.  Drinks?  Not a penny.  Food?  Nope.  Nothing.  Tickets?  Nope.  Nothing.  Parking?  Nope.  Nothing.  And I always throw the waiter or waitress a C note before the whole thing starts.  That's $100.  And say, keep coming back, because I want them bringing drinks.  That's what I like.  Caroline, sometimes I'll go down there with six to eight people, and I'll even go to Greg. 
[02:32:30]  Look, Greg, I don't expect you to, you know, cover all these people.  You know, please don't do that.  St. Greg Charles, you mean?  No shit.  St. Greg Charles, I call him.  Next thing you know, not a bill everyone drinking and eating for free.  Wow.  And this guy, I knew this was coming, and this is why I got to explain.  David Freeland from Kansas City.  You know what, David?  I agree with you in some feedback, but I'm going to make a point here.  He writes, are you fucking kidding me, Opie?  You make a shitload of money.  Have fun.  Enjoy the evening in the same manner the rest of us have to.  No.  We're fancy, important people. 
[02:33:00]  I'm not expecting comics to pick up my entire bill, but how about a little acknowledgement  that we're working hard for your fucking club?  Can I just say something?  How about this round is on us?  That's all.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  But that's part of being famous.  That's the part about having money, is that you worked your ass off for a long time.  Now you get everything for free, and you don't even need it.  Right.  You get free sneakers.  You get free shirts and clothes and watches.  All the free stuff goes to the people that don't need it.  Exactly. 
[02:33:30]  That's American right there.  That's American.  Just for being fancy.  We put a lot of butts in the seats.  All I'm saying is a little...  Except when I did it.  A little acknowledge of that.  Except when I did it.  A little acknowledgement of that.  See, I'm getting killed on this one.  I'm not...  Chris, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  What's the show?  Fuck you, Bob.  Wait a minute.  Slow down, sir.  What'd you say?  I said, fuck you.  Really?  Fuck me?  How about fuck your mother, you dumb cunt?  You have your fucking wedding on the internet like a homo.  Yeah, but you didn't see it, you faggot.

You're going to walk up.  You're going to be a triple X, you sweating, fat fucker.  That's what you ever got to do if I ever there was a fucking crud.

[02:35:30]  Doing nothing.  Exactly.  Shut your fucking mouth.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  I wish I had his fucking money, you fucking idiot.  That's right.  So don't you.  Yeah, keep saying it.  Keep repeating, because you're running out of shit to say,  you fucking regular person.  You regular person.  You're a regular person, you faggot.  Come up to the show.  I'll be by the stage door smoking. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Really?  Where's yours, you fucking normal fucking sweat hog?  You fucking sweat hog.  Enjoy making minimum wage, you faggot.  You faggot.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You fat nobody.  Hey, hey, you fat nobody, you regular person.  You fat fan.  Fuck you, you fat, overweight nobody. 
[02:36:30]  How's it feel being a fucking fan?  How's it feel being a fan?  How's it feel having to wait on hold until they let you through?  You fan.  You're a fan.  You're a fucking fan.  No, I'm not a fan of yours.  Good.  I'm glad you're not a fan of mine.  And you know who's not a fan of yours?  Nobody's your fan.  Nobody.  Nobody knows you exist, you faggot. 
[02:37:00]  That hurt.  That wasn't nice.  I'm sorry, dude.  I didn't mean to hurt you.  What's up, Bobby?  I really stepped over a little bit there.  I apologize.  You guys are just trying to have a little fun.  You're right.  I apologize.  I shouldn't have said that.  You don't know where the line is.  I apologize for him, Chris.  I apologize.  Bobby, I'm serious, no?  Not you.  Oh, no.  He hung up now.  Well, I wasn't trying to like...  Spirited? 
[02:37:30]  Put the word out there that I expect things for free.  Of course not.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that a little acknowledgement, because we work hard for the comedian here.  It isn't the personality saying, I need free stuff.  It's the personality saying the club should recognize what is being done here.  The one hand washes the other thing.  We plug the club.  We get the people in there.  They should be a little appreciative and show their appreciation.  Just an acknowledgement is all I'm asking for. 
[02:38:00]  I don't need free stuff, but just a little, hey, thanks.  We did really well because of you and Ant.  And here, here's the next rounds on us.  I still would have spent a nice number there.  It's also a local club, though.  E-Rock was there with his future wife.  I had me and my girl.  I had some of the Philly crew there.  There was like six to eight of us there.  So, you know, I was dropping some cash.  Just a little, hey, thank you.  Here's the next rounds on us.  Yeah, but it's a local club, too.  It's New York City.  Your show's in New York.  You guys promote them all the time for free. 
[02:38:30]  And, yeah, you definitely should be hooked up.  You know, I mean, what we do for some of these clubs, they really should be buying advertising.  Stress Factory does.  Sure.  Caroline acknowledges and goes, you know, here, anything you want, guys, because they understand  the value of what we're doing for them.  Certainly.  You make Vinny Brand pays for his time?  He buys commercials on his own, man, because he knows how powerful the show is as far as  Well, I want to buy, I'm going to back around, I want to buy two spots, one on CBS, one on 
[02:39:00]  XM, and I actually, promo, I'm actually doing Long Island this weekend.  I'm doing, midget voice.  Oh, I love it.  I love it.  That's all I was trying to say.  I wasn't, trust me, you know, I don't, I don't need stuff for free.  I just, I like the acknowledgement, though.  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Oh, I got to, I got to tell you, last night, went out to, you know, I went out east.  To mom's house, mom and Sal. 
[02:39:30]  And my Aunt Fran and Uncle Tony come over.  Ain't seen them in a while.  And wow.  This Aunt Tony?  Aunt Tony?  I mean, Uncle Tony, sorry.  No.  No disrespect, Uncle Tony.  No, Uncle Tony's not mobbed up.  Neither is Aunt Fran.  But, boy, listening to some of their take on Obama was, boy, it brought me right back  to why I have some of the ideology that I have today.  Really?  Right in the gutter stuff? 
[02:40:00]  In real, raw, uncensored form.  Wow.  Is it gutter stuff, or is it like?  No, it's stuff you can't possibly say.  That's what I mean.  In this century.  Where's the Obama thing?  It's old school Italian thoughts on perhaps there being the first black president ever.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that word was flying along with some Italian versions of the word.  Did you make?  It was always fun.  Like what Italian? 
[02:40:30]  What do you mean?  You know what I mean.  Oh.  Did you feel uncomfortable?  Not at all.  They're my family.  But, you know, if you can't discuss stuff open and freely in your own house, no matter  how politically incorrect or offensive it is, then there's a problem.  So, you know, I gave a listen.  Brought me right back to where I used to go over there and listen to them discuss those  people all the time, because that's pretty much what they say.  All I'm trying to say is, wow, my family's racist. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  You're voting for McCain.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Of course he is.  Have to.  You?  I don't vote.  And I have no problem saying it.  Apparently not.  I don't like the choices.  I love the people like, well, if you don't vote, shut up.  I will vote when I really like a candidate.  No problem.  I don't like any of these guys in the end.  Obama over McCain, I'm thinking, but I'm not voting either way.  Someone wrote an email to me and said, hey, I heard Anthony and DL talking about how they 
[02:41:30]  were more libertarian than they were Democrat or Republican.  Why don't they support the Libertarian Party then?  And but because this country runs under two parties.  And if you vote for the Libertarian Party, you're just pretty much throwing a vote away.  Yeah.  Might as well not vote.  Well, in time, it could take off.  And, you know, if people are influenced by you, shut up. 
[02:42:00]  No, it just doesn't work without a revolution.  I don't know what it's going to take for me to vote.  I really don't.  Would you vote for Hillary if she?  No.  Yuck.  No.  Yuck.  Dude, it's the same crap.  Have you ever voted?  Uh, no.  Ah!  All right, I did!  Is it Elo?  Let's see if it's Elo.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Because I'm, uh, yeah, I got to vote for McCain because of, uh, you know, I just don't 
[02:42:30]  like, yeah, I don't like Obama.  Obama and his, he's too liberal for me.  The tax and spend.  What is it?  Anybody who's.  Bigger government, get rid of my guns, everything I don't fucking want.  Anybody who makes $200,000 or less isn't going to be affected by his taxes.  Mm, I heard $100,000.  I thought it was between $100,000 and $200,000.  Now he's trying to get, uh, some votes by saying, no, there'll be a middle class tax cut.  Will there?  Really? 
[02:43:00]  But you're not middle class.  What's that going to do?  I, I, I, I, I'm one of the people that give people jobs.  That's what I do.  That's what most of, that's what the upper 3% of the money makers in this country do.  They pay the other 97%.  Because you have a job.  If you tax the shit out of people that are making a good living, you really do fuck over,  uh, the people down, down the line.  Because, uh, then companies, corporations that are, have been given tax cuts over the 
[02:43:30]  years, if you tax them, they have to start laying people off to pay the taxes.  Yeah, but don't you, don't you think that when you look around and you see, you know, a trash  can on every corner of New York City and we're not a shitty country and the roads are good  and stuff like, don't you say, all right, I don't mind paying taxes.  And we have the best military in the fucking world.  Apparently I don't mind paying taxes.  I just wrote a monster check to taxes, uh, the other day, but I don't want to pay fucking 
[02:44:00]  more taxes.  Was it a big one?  It's, it's gigantically ridiculous.  We're in a bracket.  Like, when do you pay taxes?  Like every April 15th?  Uh, no, for every, what was it?  Three quarters?  Oh, you, you do that too?  Three quarters.  What happens to the last quarter?  Do you just say fuck him?  No, he actually made me for one year.  I got fucked last year because I was supposed to go on quarterlies.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, when I did my own company.  Not You, Inc.  And, uh, he fucked me and made me do the year.  And then I, I got hit this year. 
[02:44:30]  My, my wife called me up.  We got, I mean, it was a fucking tremendous fight.  She called me up with a figure that almost made me cry.  I was in Philly at that fucking helium club.  I'm on the phone all happy.  And then she told me the number and I literally almost jumped out the fucking way.  Isn't it like you just want to, you do, you want to cry, you want to start crying.  See, it used to start paying taxes once a year.  Now we are reminded every three months.  Yeah.  That's better than paying that.  Imagine having to get that lump sum at the end.  Ooh.  One.  Ooh.  Check.  Ooh. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, the big nut.  All right, let's say hi to Jay Moore.  Uh, Mr. Moore, how are you, sir?  Hiya, boys.  What's going on?  Jay Moore.  Is this the cursing part or the not cursing part of the show?  Cursing.  Fucking A, dude.  Hey, uh, did Bobby Kelly, that's fucking dope.  Did you just say, I don't mind paying taxes.  I don't mind it.  Well, I don't, I don't have to pay, uh, 35 million a year like you.  Yeah, that would mean I make a hundred million dollars, Bobby. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  You make, it was an exaggeration, therefore lies the ha-ha.  Still, still no ha-ha.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  No, I, I file quarterly.  I'm amazed that Bobby's filing three quarterlies.  Yeah, three quarterlies, and the last quarter he's just keeping for himself.  That's how it should go.  You know what we need to get rid of, Anthony, with the two-party system is,  we don't need a Congress or a House of Representatives at all,  and we should private contract the roads, 
[02:46:00]  we should private contract the, the firemen, the police.  Like, if there is, here's a hypothetical question.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Hercules.  It's time for Professor Anthony.  Where's the song?  Oh, man, all right.  Yeah, where is it?  Hold on a minute.  A hypothetical, for a hypothetical question.  I'm going to, I'm going to swing from your marriage nuts in a minute anyway.  Hold on.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[02:46:30]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  There you go.  Yeah.  Andy, what would happen, for real, if there was no, for one calendar year,  if there was no House of Representatives and no Senate from today,  from one year from today?  One year.  And what you said, everything gets privatized?  No, no, no, just everything, none of the privatization that I said. 
[02:47:00]  Well, let's just say today they don't go to work.  And they come back to work next summer, today.  I don't, yeah, I don't think you'd notice anything.  Nothing.  Not a fucking thing would change.  Yep.  That, my friend, is a colossal failure of the three-party multilateral system of government.  Yep.  I got to agree.  Nothing would change.  Coke Logic is at home with his bong, drawing fucking cells, going, what?  That guy started an entire thread one time, going, Jimmy Moore, I don't know. 
[02:47:30]  I don't like him.  This is a fucking 1,000-page thread.  I just don't like him.  I don't know.  I just don't like him.  But then he put his own picture in his fucking avatar, like, this guy doesn't like me?  Jim from Taxi on a fucking vendor?  I like to keep all my references current, Jimmy.  Of course.  And well, you should. 
[02:48:00]  I saw Jim from Taxi on Friday walking home.  He's looking good.  I think he's in New York doing a play or something, ran into him.  I saw a great, if you want to see a great play to sound, if you want to, I want to sound  gay for a second.  That play, August, Osage County.  That does sound gay.  That sounds awful.  Bro, it won the Pulitzer Prize.  It's like this crazy drama.  Like, they go to intermission, and you're sitting there like, no, no, no, don't stop.  Keep going.  Really?  I want to know what happened.  Who did what?  The who?  Hey! 
[02:48:30]  Did you see Kung Fu Panda with your kid?  Not yet.  He's too busy fighting in tournaments.  He's an orange belt.  He's an assassin.  Jesus.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's going to go to Brazil with Patricia and Bobby and fight off the AIDS.  A little ninja.  Stupid condom with sex weirdos.  What's the matter with you middles?  Condoms are for pussies, though.  I agree.  But if you have a condom, it's like you didn't even cheat, because you can say, I actually 
[02:49:00]  didn't touch her.  Oh, yeah.  That works, huh?  Yeah, it was like jerking off inside a girl.  Yeah, let's all try that one tonight.  It's great when you talk yourself out of a condom.  You find some weird thing to hold on to.  Some, like, kernel of fake truth.  You're like, ah, she's from Minnesota.  There's not much fucking disease there.  Like, there's no disease in Minnesota.  It's too cold.  Yeah, it's too cold for the AIDS virus in Minnesota.  Like, she's got her legs open, and you're like, fuck this. 
[02:49:30]  Her father's a dentist.  You worked in the medical community somehow, you know?  I would use my thumb all the time, and just, as you're pulling out, and then putting back  in, I'd use the thumb and just rip that fucking thing right off.  She wouldn't know.  One stroke, it's fucking off, and in.  And you finish inside?  Fuck yeah.  Every time? 
[02:50:00]  Every fucking time.  What a fucking guinea.  I just leave that fucking seed.  What a dirty fucking Dago Watt motherfucker.  You're an animal.  Leave that cum everywhere.  How many abortions in your career?  Oh, my God.  How many fucking abortions?  No, none.  Absolutely not one.  You get one of those abortion cards where after the 10th, you get the next one free.  Yeah, I got the other one free.  It's all punched on the top like a Chuck E. Cheese card.  No, I never had no abortion.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, we'll go and get one of those abortions. 
[02:50:30]  My brother got his girlfriend one.  Hold on.  You're finishing inside, and you have no worries in the world, wandering for the next month.  No, I do.  Where does he care?  He's out west on a fucking ranch shooting fucking mice.  He goes from Long Island to the fucking high sea of the desert.  He doesn't give a shit.  He's a fucking, he's a guy's lonely man.  But he's a guy that doesn't like kids, so you would think that maybe you would make sure  you don't have any.  Yeah.  Well, that's a big joke.  He gets her pregnant and leaves her with the fucking kid.  Hardy, ha-ha-ha.  I didn't, yeah, people are saying, oh, I'm shooting blanks or that. 
[02:51:00]  No, I'm pretty fertile.  I've, you know, I remember when the wife wanted to get fucking pregnant.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Was that a fucking, I used to fake cumming insider.  No shit.  Are you serious?  I went like, oh, oh, oh, God, oh, that was so good.  Pull out.  She'd be like, wow, there isn't really a lot.  I'd be like, yeah, I jammed it real fucking deep.  Don't worry, it's in there.  They're swimming up the fallopian tubes right now. 
[02:51:30]  I made sure I hit the spots.  That's how the dice impression got stuck.  I'm Anthony faking.  That's what I would do.  I'd put on my dice face and make other dice fuck face noises.  You really faked cumming?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Because she wanted to have a kid?  Yes, she wanted to have a kid, so I would fake cumming and then jerk off in the bathroom.  So what would she say month after month?  And leave that precious fucking seed in the toilet.  What would she say month after month when it wasn't happening?  Well, I just decided that we should go to a fertility clinic. 
[02:52:00]  Did you?  Yeah.  And the guy took a sample of me and fucking motility or mobility, whatever the fuck it's called,  and count and shape and everything was perfect.  And for some reason, we just weren't getting pregnant.  So they blamed it on her?  Oops.  Sorry.  I went to the fertility doctor, too.  And the problem with me at the fertility doctor is I had like a thousand sperm and they all look like Norton.  They're all fake smiling to camera on HBO. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, shit.  A fucking hand bone.  I thought it was my son and his fucking karate recital.  I was like, this isn't Norton.  My wife goes, what do you mean?  I go, he's smiling.  What the fuck is he doing smiling on stage?  He was a happy...  Big, long, put me on TV smiles.  Fucking baby Jane Hudson.  He was a happy boy, Jay.  Happy boy.  Shit. 
[02:53:00]  That's great, man.  Is that Bobby Kelly?  Fucking so glad somebody's making fun of someone ahead of him.  Dude.  No, I'm really as excited on HBO.  When he was on Lucky Louie, him and his fucking silent film acting.  It looked like he's ready to do a spit take at any moment.  What?  Tim, you're mad.  That's silent movie acting.  I like every one.  You're a lefty?  He did the triple take with a blowfish. 
[02:53:30]  I thought I was watching Mr. Saturday Night at a fucking fool's home.  Mr. Saturday Night.  Bobby, where are you performing this weekend?  I'm at Ronan University.  He just went to college.  People can't really buy tickets to that, can they?  No, he wants people to pick up his CD on iTunes.  Yeah.  It's all over.  They're done.  Hey, Jay, Celtics going to do this or what?  Yeah, I thought they were going to do it last night.  I mean, they did it.  They tried, but they're a great team, man. 
[02:54:00]  Paul Pierce is putting himself up in the Raptors with Bird and McKayla and those guys.  Jesus.  You're not a Lakers fan.  I'm a Knicks fan.  I can't talk shit about anybody.  I'm the fucking fan of the stupidest franchise in sports.  So you're in a tough position to root for the Celtics then.  Oh, I don't give a shit.  I like good balls.  Holla.  I'm with you.  And balls.  Open.  When are you getting married?  Sooner than later.  All right.  Just let me give you a piece of advice.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  Convince your wife.  It's all about her.  It's her day.  Yep.  Whatever she wants.  That's what you say all day.  Whatever you want.  That's what's been happening so far.  Then you have to realize it's not about her.  It's about her mother and your mother.  That's the straw that stirs the drink.  You got two Reggie Jacksons at that wedding.  They're both named the mom.  Your wife has to be fucking utterly convinced that it's all her day.  It's all about her. 
[02:55:00]  But you got to shield her from your fucking mom and her mom from going,  Why don't you wear the wooden necklace?  Won't that be beautiful?  A nice white gown and a wooden necklace.  A wooden necklace.  I got it at Urban Outfitters.  It's where the kids shop.  Where's Billy Martin in this equation?  Billy Martin's fucking dead because he drove drunk into a pool.  He probably killed me at 16.  I was going like 1979 Yankees for you. 
[02:55:30]  Me too.  All right.  But he didn't have a lot of quotes.  He said, all right, here's a Billy Martin quote.  You're not allowed to drink in a hotel bar because that's where I drink.  Billy Martin going after Reggie in the dugout is one of the best clips ever.  There's a big book of baseball quotes I just got,  and it's alphabetical by player and coach.  It's about 2,000 pages.  It's awesome.  If you want to get it, somebody wants to get it to Opie as a gift.  And Reggie Jackson has 15 pages of himself because he's such an asshole. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  But he actually gives it up for Nolan Ryan.  He says, yeah, I like fastballs.  We all do.  Everybody likes ice cream too, but you don't want it shoved down your fucking throat by the gallon every night.  That's how it gets to be with Nolan Ryan.  Enough with the fastball.  We get it.  Hey, uh, oh, go ahead, Jay.  Sorry.  No, he's just like by your fourth at bat.  You're like, stop fucking throwing it hard.  I can't take it anymore. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, give me your fucking changeup, man.  What happened?  Hey, uh, Tiger Woods, is he going to win it today?  I don't know.  That's golf, and that's for fucking rich faggots.  You don't like golf, really?  I fucking hate golf.  Put me in a batting cage.  I'll fucking rip the shit out of the ball.  I thought you would.  You know how many fucking naps I can take in 18 holes of golf?  Golf is, I just, I fucking suck at it.  Well, you got to appreciate what Tiger's doing on a bad knee. 
[02:57:00]  What, man?  You put a ball in a fucking hole.  Anthony, who cares?  Yeah.  Anthony knows.  Stupid.  Of course.  And, uh.  Fucking, and you cheat on it.  When you put it on yourself, you're like, I got a six.  Uh, five.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Tiger Woods.  I like the ball.  Fucking with his stupid fucking, his stupid Mickey Mouse face and his rat teeth.  Wow.  Him and, they look like rats.  He looks like a fucking rat.  Him and Monica Seles.  A couple of fucking rats.  A whole family of rats.  Fucking a whole family of rats, you fucking prick. 
[02:57:30]  How the fuck did Jim Boomer get famous doing a fucking impression?  I, I couldn't get on the fucking air, Henry.  What the fuck?  I do a lot of fucking famous for you, don't I?  I'll never fucking understand that shit, Henry.  How about in Casino?  I do a perfect fucking Kansas City accent, and nobody fucking notices, Ace.  You're gonna fucking tell me, you Jew motherfucker, that you said it was okay for me?  Don't start shitting here, Ace.  It's a nice fucking giant.  I don't care how mad you are at me, that's not half as mad as daddy's gonna be at us. 
[02:58:00]  I've been dead a good year and a half now, and I'm fucking rotting away.  I'm in my fucking grave, under the fucking ground, with worms in my eyes.  Oh, wow.  Bobby Kelly, come on, it's, you're tragic.  Oh, God.  Yeah, what's wrong, Bobby?  What?  Bobby, who would win in a fight, me or Gary Goldman? 
[02:58:30]  Uh, I think Gary has too much of a heart.  I want you to think about this for a second.  I'm thinking about it.  I think Gary, uh, actually, uh, has too much heart.  After he gets mad, he gets, he feels bad, so.  And I think you're a psycho, and you'd probably just snap.  But it'd be a great fight.  You know, me and him got into it.  That'd actually be a great fight.  Huh?  You know, me and him got into it on last comic stand.  Oh, I know.  I heard he put you against the wall and choked you out.  Choked you out?  Yeah, he fucking, he, I said something like, him and Todd Glass were, like, having a fake 
[02:59:00]  slap fight, and I grabbed his arms and went, hey, will you leave Todd Glass alone?  And he fucking snapped, because I've been breaking his balls for two weeks.  Because I forget, like, oh, yeah, these guys are on fucking television.  It's a little nerve-wracking.  Like, to me, it's like, I'm the host.  I show up, I read the prompt, I get home.  These guys are trying not to get fucking voted off the island.  I'm like, man, look at you, you fucking faggot.  And they're like, that's great.  I'm going to go out in front of 10 million people.  Thanks for the tip.  So he snapped. 
[02:59:30]  He grabbed me around my arms.  And carried me across the stage going, stop fucking with me, stop fucking with me, stop  fucking, and I thought he was kidding until he smashed me against the far wall.  But he carried me a good 40 feet.  Gary's 6'6".  I know, he's an island.  Yeah, and then, like, then we got separated, I went crazy, and I said to my assistant at the  time, I don't know if you remember Charlie.  Yeah, I remember Charlie.  He was a big, big fucking defensive end.  I said, you know what bothers me is all the black comics think that Gary would beat me in 
[03:00:00]  a fight.  Because they were standing outside smoking and looking at it like, yeah, J-Mom got his  motherfucking ass work.  And then Charlie looked at me like, yeah, so do I.  And then I made a U-turn in the CBS parking lot because I couldn't have an assistant, like,  thinking that Gary was going to beat me up.  So I was like, if he thinks, if my assistant think I would lose a fight to Gary, he's going  to have to witness it.  It's a bizarre thinking, right? 
[03:00:30]  No, it actually makes perfect sense.  Like, I'm going to go back and fight Gary and fucking kick his ass.  Or at least if I get the shit kicked out of me, I'll look at my assistant and go, you were  right.  But you can't have a guy working for you that thinks you're a fucking pussy?  Yeah, you can.  Oh, okay.  If you're fucking at a million in the bank, you're fine.  I don't have a million in the bank.  I'm divorced.  What happened?  Anthony, fucking Anthony, explain to these knuckleheads how it works.  You lose a lot of money.  You dig a giant hole, you stand in it, you spend the next 10 years trying to keep the 
[03:01:00]  shit at shoe level.  That's a great way to look at it.  Oh, is that the truth?  Jesus Christ.  That's unbelievable.  Hey, Jay, we're going back to that baseball book.  Someone's asking if Harry Carey's in the baseball book.  Oh, five Japanese pickers.  I can't have a boot.  George Steinbrenner's going to fight.  He's not just slamming him in his mind.  Hey, that fan's winning the Sombrano. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know if he's Mexican, I don't know if Fernando Valenzuela I have from Mexico.  He doesn't play anymore in the Major League.  I hear the guy who left me out of San Francisco.  Grew up in the Dominican Republic or someplace with the sun shining all day long.  And he drops a pop fly in the sun.  I don't get it.  Oh, here's the shot. 
[03:02:00]  Home run.  No.  Oh, grace.  Safe.  Ah.  Have you ever heard that on YouTube?  If you type in Harry Gary, where he gets every facet of a call wrong.  Oh, we got to get those.  Yeah, Mark Grace is on first, and he thinks whoever's up hits a home run.  He goes, there's a shot.  It's gone.  But it's like off the wall, and then Grace busts his ass to third, and he goes, there's  a shot.  Gone.  No.  River Park. 
[03:02:30]  Grace.  Safe.  Ah.  Can we get that?  I got to hear that now.  But nothing's better than Lee Ilya.  Yeah.  Those are the real Chicago fans.  My fucking ass.  85% of the world's working.  The rest of them are fucking here.  Rip those country cocksuckers.  So, oh, that's the wedding advice I have for you. 
[03:03:00]  That's, I like that advice.  Don't see her 24 hours.  Mm-hmm.  Can't have sex with her the night before.  Mm-hmm.  And that's all I got.  Bobby, my advice for you is keep selling that CD, brother.  Keep selling that DVD.  Stop telling me I'm your pet on MySpace.  Hey, Jay, what about your show on CBS?  Canceled.  What?  What are you talking about?  It's a joke.  See, it didn't start yet.  Oh, you're scared of me. 
[03:03:30]  No, early reviews are good.  Yeah, it's good.  It's a good one.  We might have caught a little lightning in a bottle.  As Jerry Lewis would say, I love old Jerry Lewis, Anthony, when he thinks he invented everything.  Right.  And he always looks like he has a lozenge in his mouth.  And he says, ah.  A lozenge.  He does.  Well, he's got so much Vicodin in his body that he's not sure what to do with his lips and tongue.  And they needed a singer.  And I said, why don't you call my pal Frank Sinatra? 
[03:04:00]  This night at Copacabana, there was a liner on the block.  Dean and I shot down.  I wrote out 45 sketches on a cocktail napkin.  The next show, you couldn't get a ticket.  Really?  Did you do fucking radio between shows, you fucking liar?  I remember when John Glenn was the first man to orbit the Earth, I said, how long do you make him do three orbits?  That'll really get in the Russians' crop.  They wanted John Glenn to do orbit.  I'm sorry I'm going to sound like Tom Brokaw.  No, you got it, Jay. 
[03:04:30]  That is so funny, the fucking lozenge.  It does look like he's pushing something around his mouth with his tongue and his jaw is moving.  Of course he is.  Well, I don't think you're a deer man.  But that's what I told Ray Kroc, why don't you just have a golden M?  That's your whole logo right there versus history.  We had lightning in a bottle.  Lightning in a bottle.  That's really good.  Jay, what's the show about?  I'm newly divorced.  I hate the fucking lady I was married to. 
[03:05:00]  And she hates me.  So whenever we're together, we just fight like fucking crazy.  And then the show starts with me having sex with Jamie King, that model.  And then right post-coitus, that means done fucking for the pests, they walk in on me because  I forgot that it's my weekend with my kids.  So I'm like fighting with the, hey, meet this old boss, same as the old boss.  You know what I mean?  Wow. 
[03:05:30]  It's funny.  Go to YouTube, type in Project Gary, and leave a whole bunch of comments.  Like, frunkist.  No, it's getting a good review so far.  But we'll be back.  I mean, I know you guys can be in the studio anyway.  I want to, but when I'm back on the East Coast, we'll definitely make it happen.  Hey, I had a spy that ran into you.  Oh.  My buddy, Brother Wee, saw you on the sidewalk and yelled, Opie and Anthony T, and you gave  the thumbs up, like, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  He worked outside Whiskey, what's it called?  A restaurant on 55th.  Whiskey, 55th.  The guy was standing outside a bar.  Oh, okay.  On 55th.  He yelled, hey, Jay, blah.  And I didn't say anything.  He goes, hey, pass things up with Opie.  There's nothing wrong.  And then I turned around and gave him the thumbs up.  Pass things up, yeah.  Oh, there's nothing wrong with us, I think.  No, it's the old radio tag.  I think Ronnie started that. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Got it.  Bobby, you should have heard of him last week.  I really thought he was going to cry from Wednesday to Friday.  Why?  What was wrong with him?  Oh, the wedding stuff?  The wedding stuff?  And then he tried to make fun of me, but I was actually pulling onto the fucking soundstage.  He's like, what are you doing, driving people home from your show?  I'm like, no, I'm actually on stage six of the television show.  I'm like, okay, I guess you win.  He goes, okay, I guess you win. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, he lost that one.  I want my daughter to go to community college.  Yeah.  They're still talking about that on the message boards.  They're saying Voss was right.  How can he be right?  I don't think Voss would be right about anything.  You got fucking married in fucking moose head, moose jaw.  Moose jaw.  Moose jaw in Canada.  Moose jaw.  There is a moose jaw.  There you go.  There's a town moose jaw.  There is.  There's a moose jaw and there's an elbow. 
[03:07:30]  An elbow Canada.  Bobby, good to know you're hitting the big towns.  Bobby, what do you weigh right now?  I have no idea.  He's lost a lot of weight.  Yeah, he just lost.  This Tim Russert thing is around the clock coverage.  Now they're saying a wake-up call for heart disease?  Like people didn't know you could die of a heart attack at this point?  Well, fuck Tim Russert and fuck his father because their book is the one that bumped me  up the bestseller list.  Oh, no.  That's not good. 
[03:08:00]  What do I care?  Oh, I was just trying to help you out.  Bobby, you should write a book.  Yeah, if I can spell.  What?  It's like you've got to be able to spell.  I can't even fucking finish a blog.  I have a blog on my computer and it's just every word has a squiggly red line under it.  When you write a book, it should be called, When I Get Fatty, Why Is It My Head Gets Smaller?  By Bob Kelly.  The natural phenomena that is Bob Kelly. 
[03:08:30]  Hey, Doug in Waltham writes, Hey, my company did the pilot testing for Jay's show.  Everyone thought it was hilarious.  Oh, cool.  Thanks, Doug.  There you go.  All right, Jay.  All right, so let's see if the pests can blow up this fucking YouTube board.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  I love when they leave specialized comments.  Yeah, fun stuff.  I got a couple frunkuses and linger longers on there.  Hey, where's Jimmy today?  He's coming back from Bonnaroo.  I heard he killed.  I hope he killed.  A few people said he was better than Chris Rock, who was also there. 
[03:09:00]  Well, they're very different guys.  Well, we'll see.  We'll get a report tomorrow.  He also got to see Metallica from the stage.  Really?  Really?  Yep.  He must have fucking came.  Yep.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Nice?  That a boy.  So nice that he was babysitting Keith's kids over the weekend.  Keith the cop.  Yeah, but you know Anthony.  Him and kids, eh.  But now he's all about the kids. 
[03:09:30]  No, I'm not all about.  I can fold my clothes and put them away.  Pussy will make you do crazy things.  I'll see you later, guys.  I'm going to go.  I love you boys.  All right, Jay.  I like you a lot.  All right, thank you, Jay.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Live from Hollywood.  We're going to take a quick break.  We went on a 30-minute...  Dingle, dingle.  30-minute tangent.  Certainly did.  We got...  Remember...  I don't even remember their names anymore.  Gus and...  Elmer and Gus. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  We got the female version of them right here in my hand.  Wow.  Two ladies.  We'll get into this story next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie!  Anthony!  And Norton, too!  Good times, great hits!  XF-202!  Suck my fucking cock!  I want to thank Bobby for filling in for Jimmy today. 
[03:10:30]  Doing a great job.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Just a tip on iTunes, right?  You want that CD to move up a bit. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That'd be nice, right?  Yeah, iTunes.  How many have you sold to date?  Doing pretty good?  Yeah, they're doing good.  I mean, it's, you know, it's hard to track, but on iTunes, it's staying in the top 50, you know.  I think there's 100 comedy CDs out there.  Right now?  Yeah.  On iTunes, you can go to top 10 comedy.  Wow.  And you can see the top 100.  I think there's only around 100 CDs out there.  That seems to be a lot, to be honest with you.  100 comedy CDs. 
[03:11:30]  There's a lot.  Is it mostly comedians?  All comedians.  Well, you know what I mean.  Like, is it other stuff that's in the funny category?  There's a few, but there's a lot of people.  I mean, everybody.  I guess what I'm trying to say, because now people are going to make fun of that, because  they make fun of everything.  Yes, they do.  But I mean, comedians like them doing, you know, sets.  Yeah.  Or is there other stuff where they're play acting?  It's mostly comedy sets.  Comedy CDs.  So there's 100 comedians with CDs.  Wow.  No, some people have like four.  Like, Dane has five CDs. 
[03:12:00]  That are still selling.  He's number one, two, and three.  One, two, three, four.  How much do you think he's worth now?  A mil?  No, he's got...  Perhaps more.  All right.  You want to talk about taxes?  He told me he had given taxes once, and...  I almost threw up out the window.  Could you buy a...  Because I was bitching about my taxes, and he was like, really?  And then he goes, this is what I just wrote.  I was like, okay, so it's not that bad.  Can you buy a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for that tax check? 
[03:12:30]  On the fucking moon.  With the ship that comes back when you want it.  Wow.  To get groceries.  No.  Yeah, it was probably...  All right, here we go.  Lesbian couple of 55 years.  Ah.  Ready to say?  I do.  Hmm.  Thank you, California.  This is...  We got another Gus and Elmer situation.  Gus and Elmer is one of our favorite stories ever.  Oh, they ruled.  They fucking ruled. 
[03:13:00]  Two just old flaming homos, and...  Finally, you got to get married.  One was what?  Do we remember the ages?  They were in their 60s.  Gus and Elmer.  They weren't in their 60s.  Elmer.  I think they were like 80 or something.  They were in their 80s.  They were as old as dirt.  The old dirt road.  Yeah, Gus and Elmer.  And we were just kind of wondering how it was when they were young and gay, since they,  you know, grew up in a time we didn't really accept that. 
[03:13:30]  88 and 84.  And they were both war veterans.  They were both war veterans.  Yeah.  And we were just imagining what the newsreel footage would sound like, talking about them.  Here they are, ladies.  Two bachelors.  They just haven't found the right girl yet, we suppose.  We suppose.  Look at these two.  They're the best of chums, spending all their time together.  Out and about.  I'm sure cruising for girls. 
[03:14:00]  Hubba, hubba.  Here they are at the Stork Club.  Look at the women wandering about, looking at them.  They don't even look interested.  Playing hard to get Gus and Elmer.  Just so they don't want to fess up to the fact that they're gay.  Just not acknowledging that they're gay.  Two soldiers fresh back from the war zone.  Know who's the greatest at that?  Regis Philbin.  If you want to have fun, when these flaming gay guys go on like Regis and Kelly for the 
[03:14:30]  interview, there's Gus and Elmer, by the way.  Gus and Elmer.  Oh, God.  One looks like Ernest Hemingway.  Old shriveled cocks.  And the other one looks like old character actor.  Yeah.  Ah.  A Maud's husband.  Yeah.  Regis Philbin.  He's got a bolo tie.  Great.  Regis.  Regis Philbin will get guys on that are so obvious that they're gay. 
[03:15:00]  Everyone knows they're gay.  The audience does.  Kelly does.  Everybody.  And Regis will just ask the dumb, when are you settling down question.  So, have you found a lady?  Have you found yourself a lady yet?  I'm certain they must be chasing you like crazy.  Right?  Right, Gelbin?  What do you think?  I don't even know Gelbin's a fan.  How am I supposed to know what a guest likes to suck the car?  Speaking of which, and this is my humble opinion. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Who was the old guy on Regis and Kelly?  He wears like salmon colored suits and pink ties and what's his name?  The older guy.  They try to set him up.  They did a whole thing.  It lasted for weeks where they try to set him up on a date.  Really?  Art?  Is his name Art?  Art.  Same thing with Regis though, like asking all sorts of questions.  Yeah.  This guy's been with him for 40 years or whatever it's been. 
[03:16:00]  And they're trying to set him up on a date and they finally did and it was obvious like.  So, what is it about a woman that you find most attract?  A cock!  Well, with that we got a lesbian couple of 55 years ready to say I do.  You got Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin.  They fell in love at a time when lesbians risked being arrested.  Arrested?  Fired from their jobs and sent to electroshock treatment. 
[03:16:30]  Nice.  The good old days.  We like to call that.  That's how they get your lips.  That's how they cured lesbianism?  That's how they got your lips off the pussy.  Wow.  They had to hook you up to electrodes.  They smacked your face with a trout while they did it.  I was talking to this Arab guy that used to work at the cellar and he goes,  He goes, you faggot?  I go, no, I'm not.  He goes, you know what we do to faggots in my country?  We throw rocks at them until they feel better.  Until they feel better. 
[03:17:00]  If that doesn't work, we fuck them in the ass.  He did not say that.  I swear I got it.  So, wow, there was a time where, can we look that up?  Lesbians were arrested, fired from their jobs, and sent to electroshock treatment.  On Monday...  Whoa!  Wow.  Sound effects.  No more carpet.  So weird.  On Monday, more than a half century after they became a couple,  Lion and Martin plan to become one of the first same-sex couples to legally exchange marriage vows in California. 
[03:17:30]  California.  Wow.  San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom plans to officiate at the private ceremony in his city hall office before 50 invited guests.  He picked Martin, 87, and Lion, 84, for the front of the line in recognition of their long relationship and their status as pioneers of the gay rights movement.  Oh, my God.  Hair pioneers. 
[03:18:00]  Yee-hee.  Look at these two lookers, boys.  Yes, certain to turn heads as they walk down any boulevard.  These two lookers are looking for a man.  Are they really?  Diamonds are a girl's best friend, gentlemen.  So if you're looking for these two honeys, you better have some money.  Or a vagina. 
[03:18:30]  That's great.  They've been bumping donuts for 55 years.  Love the muff.  That's just nasty.  You know you're a fucking lesbian when you still fucking like the box at 80-something.  Oh, really?  You know what an 80-year-old box looks like?  Do you think they're really doing it?  Or are they just an old couple that are in love? 
[03:19:00]  What, you think they're just kissing and hugging?  Yeah, things like that.  Just so sweetie.  You're out of here.  Not like that?  You think they're doing the scissor?  Those lesbians, when they put their legs together and do the scissor?  I think there's some...  The two-headed bulldog.  I see that in the porno movies, and they're grabbing each other's ankles and just grinding their twats together.  And they're like, oh, oh.  That's pretty hot in those movies.  I've got to be honest.  Desperately trying to get something inside.  Something going.  There's just nothing there. 
[03:19:30]  Trying to smash their clits.  They just swell up.  Yeah, they're just rubbing them to...  Mashing them together.  Just trying to get a centimeter of anything inside.  Oh, anything.  Slide your clit in me.  I think this lesbian couple, they still enjoy ass-eating.  I think they...  I don't think that...  Is that a woman thing?  Is that a...  That's a guy, gay thing.  That's not a...  I don't know.  Let's ask.  Do lesbians eat each other's asses?  Do they like ass-eating? 
[03:20:00]  Lesbians?  Why would you?  What are their names?  Why would you if you got a clean hole and a dirty hole?  Why would you...  Do they...  What are their names again?  Uh...  Phyllis?  Phyllis.  It's definitely a lesbian name.  And Del.  Phyllis and Del.  D-E-L.  Eat my ass, Del.  Del.  Del.  Would you eat my ass today?  Well, of course.  I love eating ass. 
[03:20:30]  Just bends over the bed and I'll start munching that ass.  Oh, Del, that's wonderful.  Let's name that haircut the mullet.  It's a new invention.  It's wonderful.  Now take off that sweater, that oversized sweater.  I'll take off my flannel.  And let's bump donuts.  We'll do a scissor.  Take down the Murphy bed.  The Murphy bed.  Ah, that ass licking feels wonderful. 
[03:21:00]  I'll tell you, sure can lick an ass.  Oh, that's great.  Dave C. from Flint writes, that has to be like licking a sand trap.  Wow, they were the pioneers in the gay ruffles.  87.  Let's see.  We got Del at 87 and Phyllis at 84.  Gonna need a Manhattan to straighten my breath out. 
[03:21:30]  Just old pubes just feel dead.  Feel dead.  Like the hair is just dead.  There's no more life to the hair.  Put conditioner in that.  But the sides of her pussy must look like an armpit.  Oh, shit.  Along with six other women, they founded a San Francisco social club for lesbians back in 1955. 
[03:22:00]  Ah.  They called it the Daughters of Belitis.  What does that mean?  B-I-L-I-T-I-S.  Daughters of Belitis.  Belitis.  Under their leadership, it evolved into the nation's first lesbian advocacy organization.  Mmm.  They have the FBI files to prove it.  Oh, the FBI was on them.  The feds were on them.  Ah!  They're on you now.  The feds were.  Tinkle, tinkle.  The feds were, uh, taking a close look at the lesbians. 
[03:22:30]  Well, you gotta watch out.  The Daughters of Belitis.  What was their gig?  It's considered to be the first lesbian rights organization in the U.S.  It was formed in San Francisco.  The group was conceived as a social alternative to lesbian bars, which were considered illegal  and thus subject to raids and police harassment.  Ah!  Ah!  Wow.  Uh, it lasted for 14 years and became a tool of education for lesbians, gay men, researchers,  and mental health professionals.  What makes a lesbian tick? 
[03:23:00]  Let's hook electrodes to her labia and see what makes her a lesbian.  It's very establishment in the midst of witch hunts.  Mmm.  Yeah.  And police harassment was an act of courage since members always had to fear that they  were under attack, not because of what they did, but merely because of who they were.  No, it's what you did.  Licking a box when you own your own.  That's what they did. 
[03:23:30]  They, judge.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Dave from Philly writes, you're reading it wrong.  It's the daughters of Clitoris.  Yeah.  Uh, Dickie Punchcock says they're, I don't like saying the C word.  I, I, I, I just, I just can't say it sometimes.  Ma, polka.  Uh, they're, they're, they're twats.  Must look like Charles Bronson sucking on a lemon.  Oh, yeah.  Mmm.  Should I read on?  The feds. 
[03:24:00]  Please.  We're after Del and Phyllis.  All they want to do is just have some women, uh, woman love.  A lesbian bar back then being raided by cops.  Wow.  Like it's Al Capone.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Fuck, what do they do?  Just run out into the street and just a bunch of...  All right, lesbians, come out with your hands up.  Come out with your hands up, lesbians.  We're going to smell all of your fingers.  We're going to smell all of your fingers.  We're going to smell all of your fingers. 
[03:24:30]  If it smells like a day at the fishing hole, you're under arrest.  We don't like your kind here.  Hmm, they haven't come out, they won't come up with shaving for years.  What a mess.  They all look like, uh, German psychiatrists.  Little beards.  All right, lesbians, put down those pussies.  And come on out.  Yes, lesbians.  Drop the pussies and come out. 
[03:25:00]  On the floor.  Put your tongues back.  Yes, tongues and mouths.  All right, this is a bust, lesbians.  Get the tits out of your mouth.  Stop scissor-fucking.  No, scissor-fucking is illegal in 13 counties.  Drop those dildos. 
[03:25:30]  Drop the dildo.  Drop it, lesbian.  We know what your kind likes.  Okay, go around there, Murphy.  Check the teeth for pubes.  Murphy, Jesus.  Well, all cops were Irish back then.  They still are.  For the most part.  Say come out lesbians again in your style.  I love it.  Lesbians, come out.  Come out with your fingers in the air. 
[03:26:00]  Drop the box and grab your socks.  Florida, Steve.  We're arresting lesbians.  Everyone's giving you a little hand today.  Pierce writes, freeze up or I'll show you my cock.  Yes, you hate the cock, don't you?  This is like a 1950s taser to them.  They just collapse on the ground.  Oh, you hate that cock. 
[03:26:30]  Okay, come on out, lesbian.  Oh, wrong bar.  These are all men.  Look at the hair and the pants they're wearing.  They couldn't possibly be women.  Chester's liver.  All right, lesbians, remove those fancy belts.  What is that on the front of your belt, lesbians?  Lesbians.  And why are only half of you wearing them? 
[03:27:00]  You almost went to Borat there.  Lesbians.  You're under arrest.  What's up with the fancy belts?  Fancy belts?  I've never seen a buckle like that before.  Oh, my God.  God.  All right, the couple who live, we're still talking about Phyllis and Del. 
[03:27:30]  87 and 84.  Been a couple for 55 years.  Now they're going to be married.  Looks like the same gay old guys.  Here's the one on the left.  Looks like she has constipation.  You sure isn't that the other guys just in drag?  The couple who live in the same San Francisco house they bought in 1956.  It's just gross.  Do not get out much now.  Martin needs a wheelchair to get around. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, that must be nice.  Do you still lick snatch if you're stuck in a wheelchair?  Yeah, she just like goes forward and backwards into the other one's tongue in the wheelchair.  Yeah, but you've got to have like swamp butt and all that.  Yeah.  The whole area's got to be swampy.  Look at her lumpy, arthritic knuckles.  What's going on there?  Oh, yeah.  She can't even finger pop her anymore.  Her fingers are ribbed for her pleasure.  She has to just rub her knuckles backwards on her clit.  Dave B. from Philly.  Can we start that music up again there? 
[03:28:30]  Look at how the one with the gray hair is dressed.  It's like the captain of the Titanic.  She looks like...  Yes.  Newsreel.  The FBI raided what was thought to be a black market salmon factory.  Turned out to be a house full of lesbians.  The bus went down without incident when they were shown penises and fell to the ground in tears. 
[03:29:00]  Come out, lesbians.  Yes.  Look it.  Here's the film of the bus going down.  These girls don't know what cum tastes like.  They'll never know the pleasure of one of our soldiers bringing them home silk stockings.  Because they're lesbians.  The happy couple. 
[03:29:30]  We get along well, Phyllis said.  And we love each other.  I love you too, Del said.  Ah, that's sweet.  Why couldn't a couple of these pal-talk girls get together?  You're under arrest.  You're under house arrest.  At Anthony's prison. 
[03:30:00]  This is like, fuck.  There you go.  So that's what we got on that.  We got the Harry Caray call.  Whoa!  What happened?  What's up, my cousin's?  My microphone needs Viagra.  Aw.  That'd be so disturbing.  That girl that you always have up there.  You have a couple people you always have up there.  Yeah.  For a second, I thought she was my cousin.  That would be disturbing if all this time I was in my family. 
[03:30:30]  That you're staring at every day.  Might be.  If you had a cousin like that and didn't have sex with your cousin, you'd be an asshole.  Well, fuck your cousin?  Yeah.  You can't fuck your cousin.  You can absolutely fuck your cousin if she's hot.  Not a first cousin.  Not a first.  Yes.  Yes.  No, you can't.  Yes.  That's fucking my uncle's something.  Who cares?  Thank you, Bobby.  Who cares?  You can't fuck her.  What's the difference?  What's the difference?  If she's hot and you don't see her all the time.  I'm not talking about a cousin that lives like fucking next door that you grew up with 
[03:31:00]  and your family's all together.  Occasionally, like a cousin shows up and she's fucking six years old and the next time you  see her, she's fucking like 16 and you're 16.  Get the fuck out of here.  You're fucking.  What about 30?  What about 37?  Right now, that's weird.  That's weird.  Because that's like old and lonely kind of cousin thing.  What if it was like she was like 25?  I'm talking kids where you're fucking, you know, the hormones are going anywhere between  like 16 and 25.  This is where.  16 and 25, you can fuck your first cousin. 
[03:31:30]  Before we continue talking about fucking your cousin, I just want to say this is where the  Opie and Anthony completely disagree.  This is Anthony talking.  I think this is Opie.  Oh, no.  That is quite sick to have sex with your first, second, or third cousin.  Thank you.  Maybe a third.  Fuck no.  You get close and you're not third, then fuck that.  Fuck no.  You get too close and you recognize the smell.  Fuck no.  Recognize the smell.  What the fuck is it?  You're smelling.  I'm just saying. 
[03:32:00]  If you're related, you recognize the smell.  I'm not talking about this big romantic fucking love affair.  I'm not talking about having kids.  I'm talking about raging hormones pumping and fucking your first cousin.  You're talking about, listen.  And you look in their eye and you recognize the look.  What are you recognizing?  Do you see your eyes?  It's so filthy.  It's so dirty.  Yeah.  If it's a cousin that you see at a barbecue like once a year.  Once in a fucking blue moon.  And she's your father's sister's something way out there that you see once in a while. 
[03:32:30]  I'm talking something like your mother's sister's daughter.  No way.  Your father's brother's daughter.  Fucking dirty guinea.  What's the matter?  Anthony.  You can't do that.  No?  Be honest.  I want you to be honest.  I'll be completely honest.  How far have you gone with a cousin?  Not even anything.  Haven't.  Never have. 
[03:33:00]  Just in your mind?  Oh, fucking scrapped a few out.  And if the opportunity came up, I would have.  Yeah, be.  Hey, sink fucker.  Don't make me out to be a weirdo.  Touche.  Yeah, but at least you don't see the sink at Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  You kind of do.  You just see your mother washing her hands.  Washing her hands in there.  Your grandmother's face in it.  Fucking splooged in it.  My little cousin just brushing his teeth.  Oh, there's some toothpaste stuck on the edge.  I'll get it.  No, that's. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, OK.  Leave it there.  Whatever.  Hey, Harry Carey.  I want to thank Jay Moore for turning us on to this.  Some Harry Carey audio of him just blowing calls.  I do believe.  Here's the first piece.  There's danger here, Sherry.  And Pat Hughes and Ron Santo will all start to bring you an exciting description of it. 
[03:34:00]  This baby beanie is sound asleep.  Let's wake him up.  Harry Carey on the field.  Stay with us now.  Pat Hughes and Ron Hanson.  Randy Hundley.  Hey, Ron, you got to get back here.  I keep forgetting who's working.  We'll be giving you the description of the ballgame.  See you later.  Song, everybody.  His delivery sounds exhausting.  It's going to be really tiring. 
[03:34:30]  Mispronounces player's name.  Jason Eisringhausen.  Eisringhausen.  Hausenfeffer.  Mispronounces pregame program.  Stay with us for more pregame progame pregame action on the Cowboys baseball network.  God bless Harry Carey.  Now a little taste. 
[03:35:00]  You look just like your action.  What's that?  You look like your animation.  They animated you well.  Yeah, they did.  They really did.  The face.  Yeah.  They made me 750 pounds.  You guys look like fucking rock stars.  No.  Oh, really?  Not all of them.  Check out the fucking...  Not all of them.  Some of them, they fucking...  Check out the fucking Wesley Snipes one.  Yeah, that one was pretty good.  That guy, I mean, at like 90 years old.  It was really funny.  You look like one of the lesbian girls.  A lesbian.  Getting married. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  It was one that Opie's neck, I was like, that doesn't even look like his fucking neck.  That's just mean.  You know what's kind of funny is like the animators, they have their favorites on the show.  You can tell by just how they animated everybody.  They just made us, some of us...  Yeah, sometimes we looked cool, sometimes we looked like complete douches.  We all took pretty big hits.  You want to do Obama, Black Fathers, and then we'll get the hell out of here?  Sure.  This is weird, man, because you say shit like this as a white person and all hell would break loose.  Whitey.  Isn't this stereotyping, saying that black fathers need to spend more time with their kids? 
[03:36:00]  If a white person says it, it's horribly bad, racist, and you should be fired from whatever job you have.  If a black person says it, usually they're an Uncle Tom who should mind their own business and not cater to the white man.  How many, what percentage of people, black people, don't have a relationship with their father? 
[03:36:30]  It's a big percentage.  72.  That much?  I just said that.  I don't know the answer.  That would be something to look up because...  Google it.  Do you think it's an epidemic or do you think more black fathers have a relationship with their kids than don't?  Like, what do you think the number is?  Well, it depends on...  That Obama insists that he talk about it.  And the other thing, we were talking about politics earlier.  We're looking that up.  You hear what Bush wants to do? 
[03:37:00]  Yes.  Find Osama before he gets out of office.  And they're already, like, sending a shitload of troops.  Some of the European countries are helping out already.  Well, what is he waiting for?  He should have done this in 2001.  Well, then, he needs a biggie before he leaves because he knows...  Because his legacy stinks.  His legacy sucks.  But if he gets Osama before he leaves office, he's going to look pretty damn good.  He knows that.  Yeah.  They will get Osama bin Laden before he leaves office. 
[03:37:30]  Absolutely.  You think so?  Absolutely.  Why wouldn't they do it so you think they just weren't doing it for the last five years?  That's a good question.  I don't know why.  I don't know why they didn't.  Because how can they do it in the last six months when they want to do it?  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  I can't even pay attention to the show.  Can you close that fucking screen?  Honest to God.  What's going on over there?  Just close that fucking one.  That one.  What's going on over there?  I can look at any other one.  Just that one. 
[03:38:00]  Just turn away, then.  I can't.  It fucking hypnotizes you.  Turn your fucking head.  What's the matter with you?  It's a fucking 12-year-old doing calisthenics in fucking geranimals.  How the fuck am I not supposed to look at that?  Try to fucking at least pay attention to what the fuck's going on.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I've got to turn this way.  Yeah.  God damn it.  So anyways, black people, what?  All right, yeah, let's go with the black people.  So listen up here.  This is what Obama had to say.  We are most dependent on the family.  And we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation. 
[03:38:30]  But if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that too many fathers are also missing.  Guys, you and I know this is true everywhere, but nowhere is it more true than in the African-American community.  I'm looking forward to four years of that's right.  All the commenting, God, that's going to make it a lot more interesting. 
[03:39:00]  And shoo fly pie.  Speak it.  Yeah.  Preach.  Preach.  Scott.  Scott said they said on the news it's more than 50%.  Oh, yeah.  This guy believes in conspiracies.  John in Jersey, what do you got?  All right, guys.  I know you're going to hate me for this, but I really believe that it's a big conspiracy.  They've been holding bin Laden, and they're just waiting for the right time to parade him out. 
[03:39:30]  And now Bush gets all the credit for it.  That's not far-fetched.  Why not?  Nah, but then don't you think the people around him that got away would have to tell the story like they got him?  Yeah, but, I mean, if you think about it, they had to, you know, this way they kept the war going as long as they could,  and with this whole bin Laden still being out there type thing, you know?  That's a, that's...  That's definitely the, uh...  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  I don't like it.  Yeah.  Here's more, Obama.  Thank you, sir.  We know that more than half of all black children live in single-parent households.  Wow.  More than half.  You said it, okay.  A number that's doubled since we were children.  We know the statistics, that children who grow up with a father are five times more likely to live in poverty.  What is that all about, by the way?  Like, I was always scared shitless of, um, you know, getting a girl pregnant. 
[03:40:30]  Why does the black man, like, have no problem with that?  Because he obviously is just getting bitches, bitches.  Yeah, that's why they usually have a couple of, um...  But why wouldn't you just make sure...  Baby mamas out there.  But why wouldn't you make sure that you're not having kids if you want to, you know, get as much pussy as possible?  I don't get that.  I don't think it's that.  I think a lot of white girls will go get an abortion and not have the baby.  A black girl will have the baby because, you know, not just...  I don't want to say all black people, but if you don't have that much money, if you have a baby, you get money from the government. 
[03:41:00]  You get taken care of for a while.  And if you get married, that gets taken away from you.  It's some cultural thing that, uh, it just goes deep.  I don't know what it is, but there's some cultural thing where, um, I don't know.  It seems like black guys really kind of want to share the wealth, you know, spread the seed kind of a thing.  Yeah, but black girls want to have the baby, too.  Yeah, yeah, they want to have the baby.  It's okay to have a baby.  I don't know what it is culturally, but...  White girls, if you can't... 
[03:41:30]  I'm sure there's a reason for it.  White girls will not have...  If you have a baby out of wedlock, you're a slut.  My mom, you know, she had a baby.  She had to get married.  She's a slut?  She's definitely a whore.  She was, uh, yeah, she got pregnant when she was 15.  There wasn't love.  There was fucking beers in a fucking bush at some park somewhere.  Oh, fuck you.  Oh, god damn.  But they, they, she had to get married back then.  Yeah.  You couldn't, you couldn't just have a baby.  No, you could go to that town.  What town? 
[03:42:00]  There was just this town that you had to go.  Oh, that they sent all the, uh...  Un, unwed mothers.  Hmm.  Yeah, there was a town.  I'm serious, look it up.  Yeah.  How much pussy you could get at that town?  Pregnant pussy.  Fucking chicks with low self-esteem and kids.  From the Washington Post today, federal statistics show that 69% of all black children are born  to single mothers, more than twice the national average, and almost triple the rate of whites.  Wow.  More Obama.  Wow.  Poverty.  And commit crime. 
[03:42:30]  They're nine times more likely to drop out of school.  20 times more likely to end up in prison.  We should be making it easier for fathers who make responsible choices, and harder for  those who avoid them.  We should get rid of the financial penalties we impose on married couples right now, and  start making sure every dime of child support goes directly to helping children instead of  bureaucrats.  Social programs have begun, my friend. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  Wow.  If you're white and say that...  Trouble.  Maybe not, if you have the stats.  What do you mean?  If you have the stats.  You could never say...  Like, you're a liberal Democrat?  Nobody could say that.  You all right?  You already got some cred?  Is that what you mean?  No, just us.  If we had stats.  Oh, if you're a shock jock, you're out of...  You're out of work.  You're out of work.  Let's do line of the day. 
[03:43:30]  Ooh, a new sponsor today.  Ooh.  What's this?  Oh, I've heard of this.  Oh, so...  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's...  Oh, welcome aboard.  Here's the first runner-up line of the day.  Most men just get down on one D.  I got down on two when I proposed.  And the ring was pretty big.  And it was called a...  Oh, God. 
[03:44:00]  Elo wants to talk to us immediately.  No.  Elo wants to talk immediately.  The next runner-up line of the day.  And the only way they stop is if you turn over your ping-pong paddle to the red side.  That means I'm done.  I'm out.  No moss.  Isn't it going to happen?  I actually had the guy go, really?  Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly, just a tip on iTunes.  Doing very well for Bob Kelly.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Yes, sir. 
[03:44:30]  Saw the website.  Holy shit.  Nice look.  The RobertKelleyLive.com?  Yeah.  I'm serious.  Oh, thanks, man.  Then he signed in and says, welcome to Robert Kelly Live E-Rock.  What's that?  I saw it.  Oh, that's my new other thing.  It's pretty cool.  That's my new...  My own MySpace platform.  Are you Facebooking?  No, I have...  I'm starting my...  Oh, my God.  I'm starting my own thing.  Just in case.  See?  RobertKelleyLive.ming.com.  See?  Another ping from the...  Oh, boy. 
[03:45:00]  You can't read it like that.  No, it's not cool with me.  I'm not.  This is cool with you.  No fucking way.  Country?  What the fuck is that?  Line of the Day is brought to you by...  I don't even give a shit.  No.  Carbonite.  It's great stuff. 
[03:45:30]  No, I care about that.  Of course you give a shit.  Fucking chill.  What?  This fucking show is going so great.  Everything's fine.  It's just fucking...  Well, when you get a ping from Elo saying what he's saying, you know, you get a little  distracted all of a sudden.  It trails out at the end.  Is that cool with...  Does...  Ant.  What?  Does that or does not say...  Day parts.  And then...  What does that say?  The last line right there.  Is this cool with you? 
[03:46:00]  No.  It's not.  What is it?  It's not going to be cool with Ant either.  What is it?  Carbonite.com.  Oh, Christ on a Pony.  I need to see it.  Christ on a Pony?  What the fuck is that?  What is a Christ on a Pony?  Is that like a bat out of hell?  Is that like a dumb bunny?  No, it's just something I grew up hearing as a kid.  Was Christ in the good, the bad, the ugly?  Just riding around with Clint?  You jacking up.  Christ on a Pony and he only gets a pony?  What did he get?  Like some fucking stallion or... 
[03:46:30]  Christ walked.  He's on a Pony.  Christ on a Pony.  Why is he on a Pony?  I don't know.  Why is that bad?  It's something I heard.  It's like, oh, hell in a handbag.  You know?  It doesn't make any sense.  You can't fit hell in a handbag.  No, of course you can't.  And Christ wasn't on a Pony.  He was probably on a Pony.  No, he was on a jackass or something.  He didn't walk the whole time.  He had to be on a Pony every once in a while.  A donkey.  Yeah, which they didn't know there were donkeys yet because it was way back then.  You thought there were ponies?  Yeah, they didn't know. 
[03:47:00]  They didn't really have scientists yet, so they had to just say, oh, look at all these  ponies.  And then one guy was, this guy, Frank, saw Christ and he was on a Pony.  He went, Christ on a Pony.  Yeah.  It's stuck.  Christ on a Pony.  There you go.  It's stuck.  So why do we get in trouble for just pointing out an observation?  About Christ on a Pony.  You're not allowed to say Christ on a Pony if you're religious.  But you just, you saw Christ.  He was riding a Pony.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Right?  What happened?  Yeah.  Well, I'm just, I'm just completely, I need to know what Elo said. 
[03:47:30]  All right.  Is that okay with you?  Just read this while I do.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any  of your files.  Check it out at carbonite.com, promo code XM.  Here is the first runner-up line of the day.  The other two were like kind of throwaway lines.  Let's go where no man is ever supposed to go.  Oh, jeez.  I sure hope the future still has Tic Tacs. 
[03:48:00]  My breath smells like ****.  Ah, gay solo.  Speaking of gay.  Really making the list today.  Yes.  Earl is so gay.  Aye, Captain.  Black Earl is so gay.  Ooh, I like some of that black cock in me.  Yes, Captain.  You got the picture?  What picture?  Earl is so gay.  What did he do?  I hung with Ron and Fez on Friday and it got to a point where Dave was drinking vodka, 
[03:48:30]  Tito's.  Yeah.  And he started doing crazy like Tito's shots.  Right, I heard that.  So I suggested that we pour a shot into Earl's ass crack.  So Earl had to squeeze his cheeks tight so the liquid would stay in the crevice.  And Earl did this.  He's got a bubble butt.  I don't have that one.  Are you shitting me?  And he let Dave suck it out?  Yes.  And Dave sucked it out of his ass? 
[03:49:00]  I poured the vodka where Bob Kelly is and Earl was completely bent over that fucking table  over there with his bubble butt in the air and he squeezed his cheeks together to make  a nice crease for the vodka that Dave sucked out of it.  I don't know who's gay in that situation.  Earl is so gay.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll go with you on that one.  But how do you not first say Dave is so gay?  Because Dave's Dave.  Because Dave's Dave.  Yeah.  That's Dave's Dave.  Dave will do anything for the goof.  So it makes it tough to say if he's gay or not. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, but putting your lips on the dude's ass cheeks.  What is that?  They're making out?  They're fucking making out.  What is that?  It's Earl and Dave kissing.  Deep kissing.  Look.  How do you get this back on?  Did they tongue kiss?  Oh, shit.  I just erased E-Rock's camera.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock, I erased everything.  Formatted memory card.  Wait, E-Rock.  This is what I do with my girl.  Ready? 
[03:50:00]  Paparazzi!  There you go.  Show Ant the deep kissing pic.  I think I saw enough.  I think I saw quite enough.  You don't have the picture of Dave sucking vodka out of Earl's butt?  No, it's on their other camera.  And Earl took them off.  Why isn't that picture up on a website?  They were supposed to be.  They're on a Fez show, man.  They're lazy.  That shit should be up there.  For everybody.  All right, look at this picture of Bobby Kelly. 
[03:50:30]  Let me see.  Why were they doing this?  And they're touching each other's faces tenderly?  Yeah, why was...  I think they're touching each other's faces very roughly.  For what?  I don't know.  That's worse.  Just a heavy guy kiss?  Two alpha males just clanging teeth?  Oh.  Slapping tongue?  Oh, God.  Pinching the back of the neck fat?  Earl, you're so gay. 
[03:51:00]  Hold on a minute.  Where's your thing?  He's on that one.  Oh, yeah.  Ron and Fez need a three.  Earl, you're gay, though.  Yeah, Earl, what's up with that?  When I saw Friday, it was a little disturbing.  Well, we were just having a little fun.  I did have to give you a compliment for your bubble butt, though.  It was quite impressive.  Oh, my ass is spectacular.  I'm proud of it.  Show Bobby.  No.  No!  You're naked all the time on Ron and Fez.  We brought you up in this business.  Now, fucking show your ass to Bobby.  I can imagine.  Just drop your fucking pants quickly. 
[03:51:30]  You don't have to bend over the counter or nothing.  That wasn't even like...  Take your pants off and that's it, huh?  This is the new Earl.  Trust me.  The new Earl.  It really is the new Earl.  Why are you men so eager to look at my ass all of a sudden?  Take your jacket off so he can see.  And you gotta, like...  Go skin, too.  He's really...  Go skin...  No, take...  He's, like, small.  Go skin.  I'm serious.  Oh!  Look.  Look at his bubble butt.  Jesus.  It's heavy disturbing.  Yeah, he should be disturbed.  He's a fully functioning male. 
[03:52:00]  He should be disturbed.  We got little fucking rats coming out to view Earl's ass.  Just running out of Derek and Travis.  Earl, you let Eastside Dave suck vodka out of your ass.  Crack.  You were squeezing your cheeks together so the vodka wouldn't go inside.  What the fuck is wrong with XM?  They allow us to do the gayest shit, but we'd say, can we have a girl get naked and diddle  herself and all hell breaks loose.  We can look at his cocoa butter smelling ass anytime.  Just whip it out. 
[03:52:30]  Hey, this is fine.  I'll forbid we see a nice twat.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  They even got us a stripper pole.  We're not even really allowed to use it.  Except with fucking Patty.  But gay stuff, go ahead, guys.  All in.  No problem.  Just suck each other's cocks.  It's fine.  Just don't have a fucking girl in here that shows an ankle.  Yeah, but you guys did really ruin it.  I mean, the first time I was in here, you had a wiffle ball bat 18 inches in a chick's  twat.  Yeah.  I mean, it did take it a little too far.  I can't remember that.  Dude, raise up the console for the Ron Fett Show. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, you don't do that?  Mars, get in here.  Start raising it.  Where are we?  Last runner-up line of the day?  Why did you make out with Dave?  The final runner-up line of the day.  Oh, we had two chicks in here, and they wouldn't make out if we made...  That was not a pleasurable experience at all.  Was he a good kisser?  He was starting to throw up, and I could feel the bile raising.  I was starting to gag.  I'm gagging just thinking about it.  Really?  Did he have soft lips, or...? 
[03:53:30]  Don't...  Did your lip go on top or bottom?  I have no recollection of it.  You have a lot of recollection.  I'm off mic now.  I love the mic's two feet above my head.  I love the high console gags.  Keep going.  The mic is two feet above my head.  Are we up to line the...  Are we up to line the day?  Why is it able to go this high?  Mars, can we...  You got it like...  What's the word I'm looking for, Ant?  Um, I don't know. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, I see your cock bulge.  It's a good cock bulge.  Look, I turn to look at it like you're usually doing.  Because this thing is way up here, all I saw was cock bulge.  Cock bulge.  I'll cover it with my t-shirt.  All right.  A little bit.  Uh, how do we disable this?  Because I want Ron and Preston to start with this.  You unplug one of them.  You just unplug one of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, right here, I'll get one.  Yeah, he'll get one. 
[03:54:30]  There it is.  Look at these guys.  All right.  All right.  No!  Yeah, I'll plug it in.  No, he's got it.  Yeah, tuck it up in there.  Good.  That's it.  Now, let me try to lower it.  Okay, ready?  Broken.  Won't lower.  That's fantastic.  Good.  We'll leave it like this for them.  I feel like, you know, you ever go to the carnival and get to sit in a really, really big, like, chair?  Yeah.  That's how I feel right now.  I've got to stand up now to be at the level.  Oh, this is weird. 
[03:55:00]  I'm at the level I usually am at, but I'm standing.  I feel like I'm doing sports radio.  This is so strange.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  The cop gets out.  Like I said, starts berating me.  Between me and Jill, we have a lot of alcohol in your system.  No PVA cards.  Can you see Obi's head?  He looks like a paraplegic doing the show. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, you ever seen?  No.  It's an old impression.  That old gag, I remember that.  Here's my old impression.  What was it called, Dan?  I forgot what it was called, but.  Yeah, it's like if a head was DJing and the song fades out, it's a good visual for people.  Oh, God.  What the fuck is that?  Earl.  It's not real.  Yeah, it is.  That's what your pubes look like?  They were on fire?  What the fuck is over your junk? 
[03:56:00]  They thought it would be funny to put edible underwear on me.  And, of course, we had lights for the shoot, so it started to melt.  Dude, did you lay down in tar?  Stop.  Oh, it's like stymie, the degrading years.  His cock looks like a driveway.  Oh, God.  You look so gay.  That could be in a gay man's magazine.  Well, look at the colors.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You're like a white man on your chest.  Yeah.  Then you're kind of Indian on your arms. 
[03:56:30]  Earl, do you like pussy?  He has Puerto Rican ankles.  Of course I do.  No, you can't just say...  Look, I can look at Anthony, and if he says, of course I do, it's very believable.  If you like pussy, why don't you get pussy?  I'm just a horrible human being.  Wow.  His torso is like a white dude.  Yeah, you're really white.  The rest of you is a lot whiter than your head.  No, I'm very light-skinned from the waist. 
[03:57:00]  In the waist area.  Yeah.  Which photo do you like the best?  That one?  Yeah, which gay photo do you like the best?  Holy...  With a bow tie?  Fucking gay.  Do you like that one, or do you like this one?  Well, I like it.  I like that one.  Now, Lily took those pics?  She took those, yeah.  Did she get to see the Earl cock?  Oh, yes, she did.  Oh, she did?  Yes.  What did she say about it?  She was not impressed, no. 
[03:57:30]  You destroyed the myth?  Earl, how big is your cock?  I don't know.  I think I'm fine.  Do you have a big piece?  How many inches?  I don't sit at home and measure it.  If I have at least seven.  Three, four, what do you got?  Can you do this?  Can you do one hand, two hand, and then the thumb on the top?  Can you do this?  Can you do this?  Like, one hand, then another hand.  One hand and a thumb?  What's wrong with you, Bobby?  You can't do that? 
[03:58:00]  Oh, you said two hands.  Well, it's one hand and then over the other.  I thought you were saying...  I thought you were bragging about one hand and the thumb.  Two-fisted with your head still sticking the...  Through the top.  Yeah, you can rub the mushroom cap on the top with two fists over the top of each other.  Two fists.  Can you do that?  Two fists.  I'm going to try that at home.  I'm not really sure.  I could probably do that.  Two hands.  Two hands.  Jerk off with the top hand.  You could probably do that.  You're fucking huge cocked.  I can't do that.  I can't do that.  It's very fun.  I can just rub the pee hole and open it a little bit. 
[03:58:30]  Rub the pee hole.  That's it.  Ant's cock picks little league teams.  That's why he couldn't get his wife pregnant.  He was coming on the egg and drowning it.  All right.  We're going to leave the console really high.  Yes, he shut a hole through the egg.  As we play your line of the day.  So, Earl, thanks, I guess, for nothing.  What?  What do you want me to say?  I don't know.  Are you really gay?  No, I'm not.  Oh, you're not.  No, I'm not. 
[03:59:00]  Why don't you get pussy then?  I'm just bad.  I'm awful.  Is it a religious thing?  No, not at all.  Do you ever pay for it?  No.  You don't want to pay for it?  No, I don't.  What if somebody else paid for it for you?  To me, it's the same thing.  Yeah, but if someone just showed up at your house and was like, hey, I'm here to blow you.  I don't really understand the pay thing.  What, paying for sex?  Nope.  What, are you out of your mind?  I'm serious.  Are you serious?  I swear to God, I'm serious.  That's because you're entitled.  Why am I entitled?  You've been a good looking little white guy your whole life. 
[03:59:30]  Not, nope.  Nope.  Paying for it, especially when you're on the road a lot, when you pay for it, it comes in.  Dude, I was a disaster growing up.  Really?  I had no dates in high school until I was a senior.  Really?  Yeah, I was always way too small, tiny.  You never paid for sex ever?  No.  Never?  No.  It's not my thing.  Anthony?  No.  Jesus.  It's a weird psychological thing because I know they're not into it. 
[04:00:00]  They're into it because of the cash.  We've gone over this and people think I'm nuts and that's fine, but I need to feel like  the woman is into it.  Yeah, it's called $100 more.  Yeah, but then I know they're doing it for the money.  It's nice to know someone wants you.  Really?  Yes.  Dude, I used to pay $20 a crack horse to suck my cock.  It was about getting my cock sucked.  I understand that.  I understand you're trying to get off, but I don't know.  I don't think there's anything better than a hooker. 
[04:00:30]  I'm not saying you're wrong.  Like a reliable hooker?  There'll be a million people that will call and agree with you, Bobby.  Right.  I'm just saying it was never my thing.  I get pissed off when I go to strip clubs and the girl is like, you know, like dancing  for me just for the cash.  Yeah, but strip clubs are different because they-  That's not as bad, trust me, but when they really start playing it up, like, oh, like,  shut up.  I know why you're doing this.  Yeah, but strip clubs, I'm with you.  I hate that shit.  I hate strip clubs.  I hate it.  But the fact that I can get that same girl and have her actually take my shit out and 
[04:01:00]  I get to bust my junk all over her face, that is somehow redeems the fact that she, you  know, doesn't like me.  No, I get it.  I mean, there's a lot of people that will agree with you, Bobby.  I'm just saying this.  It's never been my thing.  What are you going to do for your bachelor party?  What are we going to go to?  Fucking Dave and Buster's?  That's a really good question because it comes up a lot and it's like, I would probably  do that type of thing.  Uh, I'm not going to suffer, but I mean, I'd probably would do it more for like the  people going. 
[04:01:30]  The other people.  Dude, and I've lived a bachelor party for fuck.  How many years?  Oh my goodness.  How many fucking years?  Yeah, but your bachelor party is for you, but it's more for the other guys that are your  friends that get to go and get a blowjob for 60 bucks.  But I'm so not that guy.  Go to the bachelor party, right?  And then they, oh, let's bring them up on stage and they have to rip your shirt off and  tie you down to a chair and humiliate you.  I'm like, ugh, I'd rather go play golf.  Yeah, that is humiliating.  They take that.  I hate that shit.  You ever see that where the girl does a dildo show and then she'll put the dildo in the 
[04:02:00]  guy's mouth?  Ugh.  I hate all that shit.  Forcing you, like forced fucking sexiness.  They think it's all hot.  Usually it's a slob.  They rip your jeans down and then they're spanking you.  Just like, ugh.  Now get on your knees and I'm going to take.  You bad boy.  Yeah?  Yeah, am I a bad boy?  How about I punch you in the face?  I like, you know what I do like is the bachelorette parties where they have the guys, the strippers  come out and those girls really just start blowing these guys. 
[04:02:30]  I've seen those big guys.  Oh, you like that?  You like that?  Just some fucking...  Some of those videos that got to be honest with Bobby are kind of hot because these...  Regular chicks.  These fucking women that you were...  You know them from your own family.  Right.  Like, that's my aunt Blank.  Exactly.  That's my cousin who we thought was a prude.  That's whatever.  And they're just...  Oh, they're so cute the way they do it because they look at it, they look around and they  look at it and they go...  Dude, if that shit is true, man, the women have no reason to yell and scream at their guys 
[04:03:00]  for doing bachelorette parties because you've...  Have you seen any of these videos?  They put...  The guy puts the towel around the girls so they can do it in sort of privacy.  Yeah, he puts the whipped cream.  You can just tell all hell's breaking loose behind the towel.  He takes whipped cream and then draws a fucking 13-inch line down his cock and then puts it  in grandma's face and you...  Grandma gobbles it up like no one's business.  Oh, my. 
[04:03:30]  This is tasty.  I got to admit, there's something about those videos that are kind of a turn on.  It is.  What is it called?  Ladyboy USA or something like...  Loverboy USA.  That's what it's called.  Be careful because they got some fake ones out there where it's obviously said.  No, Loverboy is real.  You could tell that this is the real fucking deal.  So sexy.  Dude, and then you get these girls that are like 17, 18.  And they know how to suck a cock.  They almost...  They'll see the aunt sucking a cock but she doesn't have to do it.  Then the 17-year-old just go, give me that. 
[04:04:00]  And just start tickling his nuts.  You've never seen these videos, Ed?  No.  If they're fake, then, man, whoever directed these videos should be in Hollywood.  They can't be.  Because they look way too real, man.  It's like a little hall in the middle of the Midwest somewhere.  Every once in a while, you'll see a lady in the back just disgusted.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  Just disgusted.  Could you imagine being at a party and then all of a sudden, just every girl there just  started sucking cock? 
[04:04:30]  That sounds like a hell of a party.  Because one girl sucks a cock.  If one girl sucks a cock, there it is right there.  That's it.  Yeah, but see, those look like they're fake.  No, these are real.  These are absolutely real.  All right.  Get one that's...  This is real.  Get one that's...  Punch up a movie, Rock.  It's loading.  It's loading.  Fuck.  Oh, no.  And you be the judge.  If it's real or not.  I've never...  It's fake.  I can tell.  Oh, it's so great.  I love when she kisses it and like, okay, that's cute. 
[04:05:00]  And then she looks at it again and she gets like, that's a cock.  You know the way girls do that?  You take...  Everybody's just been with a chick and you make it out and then you take a cock out and  she's like, no, no.  And then there's a point where she's like, fuck that.  I'm sucking.  Fucking...  You're like, that's right.  I fucking hypnotized you with my fucking cock.  Fucking...  Fucking Bobby.  Bobby, you're...  Problem?  You're brilliant, man.  Bobby killed today.  Let it be known.  Than used to get this in seconds.  Let it be known.  Than was amazing. 
[04:05:30]  He was also good with the music cues that had been fucking up.  Yeah.  Than was good at my show this weekend.  I missed Than.  Than did all right?  Yeah, he did pretty good.  Good to hear.  Good to hear the boys do all right.  Now E-Rock's going through all kinds of...  I don't know what he's going through.  Menus.  Well...  Just hit play.  Something's open.  He's got to drag and drop something.  You want to do Line of the Day?  It's not loaded yet.  You want to do Line of the Day?  It's loading.  You want to do Line of the Day?  Now it's loaded.  You want to do Line of the Day?  Put something on there.  All right, here we go, here we go.  Yeah, but some of the...  This is real.  All right, let's see if this is real. 
[04:06:00]  This is real.  So you got the guys doing his thing.  He's like, freaking bachelorette party.  Now he breaks out the towel.  There's a towel.  Look.  Here comes some...  Man, what the fuck?  He puts the towel around the girls, and then they...  And they're...  Holy shit.  And they're just fucking sucking cock.  But that looks like two porno chicks.  That's hard.  You have to download the ones... 
[04:06:30]  That one looks very questionable.  Go to Red...  Red...  No, what is it?  Tube8.com and download it.  That tube word is just being overused now.  With everything.  Tube8 is my favorite new one.  Fuck...  Tube8?  Tube8.  That damn word will make cancer cool.  Yeah, cancer tube.  I got cancer tube, yo.  You got to download it.  Because the ones where he's in the crowd, and you can see the old ladies are right there.  Yeah, that one looked way too...  Yeah, that's the one...  That looked like that was two porn chicks.  Well, this is just fucking hardcore pornography here. 
[04:07:00]  This looks great.  Full-length movies.  Jesus.  I downloaded one the other day of...  Oh, God.  It was...  What was it?  The aunt that was taking care of the younger little nephew, and then a friend.  They caught him sleeping, and his cock was out.  Twisted.  Where is it, Iraq?  We're looking for it.  Oh, boy.  Should I do line of the day?  There it is right here.  Should I do line of the day?  Line of the day.  Is it lover boy?  No.  What is it?  Lover boy?  No.  Type in lover boy.  We did lover boy already.  Lover boy stunk. 
[04:07:30]  Lover boy's good, too.  Steve, you don't know where this shit is?  You're usually good.  It's called...  Oh, God.  I can't reach...  I can't reach any buttons.  I'm still way down.  Is it on?  The genre's called CFNM.  Clothed Female, Naked Male, and...  CFNM.  They're mostly...  They're mostly shot in, like, Holland and places where they...  I hate this genre.  Genre.  Genre.  They just replaced the clothed female.  Party hardcore.  All right. 
[04:08:00]  Let's see if this one is...  This one's loading.  Loading.  Loading.  Loading.  As we watch the ads on the other side with a girl rubbing her asshole.  Loading.  And some animated...  Loading.  Asian women.  Bit of fucking internet in Iraq.  Earl, what's on the Ron and Fez show today?  Um, we'll have to listen to Nuna 3 to find out.  Oh, come on.  No tease like that.  That means you fucking have nothing.  That means you haven't prepared.  You're going to make Ronnie do all the heavy lifting again.  How about you give him something to work with? 
[04:08:30]  It stinks.  Nice comeback.  What the fuck?  Don't you hate when something has to load and there's no indication of how long?  What?  They just put some spinning thing in the middle?  Yeah, but it should load, like, in two seconds.  Of course it should.  Just enjoy the centipede.  I was on there the other day.  Enjoy the centipede.  I'm enjoying the centipede.  There's something wrong with it.  Because this site loads...  That's why I like the centipede.  I want to see some hags suck some fucking cock. 
[04:09:00]  That's what I want to see.  Come, you old bat.  Get over here and fucking suck this.  Oh, God.  Well, that worked, D-Rock.  Can you just type in...  Oh, okay.  What happened, E-Rock?  I hit play.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, boy.  You ruined it.  Zan?  Zan, if you're listening somewhere, could you come in and do E-Rock's job, please?  Did you type in Loverboy?  We did Loverboy.  Loverboy sucked.  Drunk, hardcore sex party. 
[04:09:30]  That sounds good.  Yeah, but that's just a sex party.  It might be like a...  Dude, there was like a video series.  What was it called?  Loverboy USA.  You sure?  Yeah, but that one you saw...  The one I saw looked way too fucking real.  You need the old one.  That's what I saw.  I saw the women in the background with their arms folded, pissed off.  I saw all that shit.  Let me see this.  Because it was more long shots, so you can take a look at the room to see, you know, if  it was real or not.  Yeah. 
[04:10:00]  What the hell is that?  Oh.  All right.  Bobby started typing on the computer.  I started hearing odd noises.  Like ticker tape.  Look at Bobby work the porn keyboard.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  Just da-da-da.  Passwords.  Live connect.  Cameras.  Boom.  Where we going, Bobby?  Where we going?  That's a good one right there.  That's not it.  There it is right here.  You ready?  All right.  Here we go.  Look at Bobby.  Look at fucking Bobby Kelly. 
[04:10:30]  Look at Bobby getting all...  All right.  Here we go.  Now, you tell me this is fucking like porn stars, Anthony.  The guy came off the stage.  He's got whipped cream on his cock.  And he's just looking...  And she is just gobbling it up.  And they're all laughing.  Look at this room.  Look at old grandma.  She don't want to lick any whipped cream.  Right.  Exactly.  Look at this.  Look at my face.  You're telling me this is...  This isn't set up.  I mean, you're telling me this is fake.  This is a bachelor at party.  There's no way this is fake.  How embarrassing for that guy.  He's got such a small dick. 
[04:11:00]  Small dick.  You know...  Fucking...  I've been a Cloverfield cock.  Look at this.  Look at that.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  She got a mouthful.  She wants some more.  Oh, she wants some more.  Look at her.  She wants that cock.  Dude.  This is fucked up.  Dude, it's innocent, though.  Because they're just grabbing some whipped cream.  Oh, right.  That's all.  They're just grabbing some whipped cream.  Oh, it's great.  Here we go.  And there she goes with a big fucking line of it.  Look at her.  She wants it back.  She is just...  That's the crazy end.  Like, watch, watch, watch. 
[04:11:30]  Oh, I don't really do this.  Oh, look at her.  Okay.  All right.  What happened?  It ended?  Yeah, you get a little taste.  You get a little taste.  Yeah, they got a little taste.  Now you gotta, like, pay the man if you want more.  Pay the man.  I fucking jacked until I was just ready to come.  And the second this one thought she was gonna get this little taste of whipped cream without  touching the dick, I just fucking shoot in her face.  You can see, though, some of these girls really start sucking his cock.  Oh, yeah.  And all of a sudden, he'll just be like, all right, I gotta go.  Like, he's just about to blow his dick. 
[04:12:00]  Yeah, because it's not a guy.  Dickie Punchcock writes, type in, greatest job ever.  Women paying you to suck your junk.  What?  The guys, they get paid to have girls.  These fucking wild girls suck their junk.  Yeah, yeah.  And what do you think?  Is that real?  That looked pretty real.  That looked pretty fucking real.  Oh, we're seeing a replay.  Look at this.  I don't know.  Should I?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, it's just whipped cream.  All right, let me grab this guy's dick and just fucking...  Oh, yeah. 
[04:12:30]  Who wants more whipped cream?  What about you, old bag?  Oh, I'm not sure.  Like her.  She needs a load thrown right on her neck.  She just pecked at it like a little chicken.  Yeah.  She didn't touch any dick.  She just hit the whipped cream.  Look at this one.  This one.  Come on.  Look at this dirty...  This...  Yeah, she...  Look at her.  Oh, my God.  She went right down on it.  Watch this.  More.  More.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ. 
[04:13:00]  There's like 10 of these, though.  You can watch like 10 of these.  What the fuck is going on?  I love that.  And here he goes spraying half the fucking can down his dick.  Just fucking...  Fucking...  You could tell she fucking probably just goes to completion.  Look at this.  Yeah.  And she put the whole thing in her mouth.  She sucks cock like we drink coffee in the morning.  She's just ready to go.  You see her face?  Holy shit.  She was actually trying to act like she hasn't sucked a cock in the last hour. 
[04:13:30]  In the last hour.  That got me horny.  All right.  We got to go.  Here's your line of the day.  Carbonite.com.  I don't even know what this is about anymore.  It's been so long.  Carbonite.  Carbonite.com.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day. 
[04:14:00]  Happy Father's Day.  And I just stared at him because I didn't know who he was talking to.  Yeah.  So I just stared at him and then Jill kind of elbowed me and was laughing and I went,  oh, thank you.  And it's like, and then I started thinking, does this guy think I'm with my three daughters?  What the fuck was that?  The tag's not working that well.  That's it.  It's all right.  We had a good show today. 
[04:14:30]  Yeah.  Earl, leave this console for the boys.  Tell them it's a little present from Opie and Anthony.  I don't know about that, but.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  Enjoy the setup for their show.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Yeah.  All right, Earl.  It's been a pleasure.  You had it a lot for us today.  I appreciate it.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Look out.  The fuck was that?  Let's do a show like this.  Actually, I would like it like this with stools. 
[04:15:00]  Yeah.  Tell Wicklin we need stools.  Big giant stools we need.  Yeah, let's do stools now.  We'll just do the, we're really high off the ground show.  Give my opinion.  Who was that guy that just walked by?  I'm on every day.  Yeah, let's do that.  Who was it?  Asshole I am.  Get stools.  Yeah.  Get out of my way.  All right, we're done, man. 
[04:15:30]  Let's get the fuck out of here.  No.  No?  Are you going to go home and jerk off to Loverboy?  Loverboy, USA?  What?  What?  Oh, that fucking.  Hey, Bobby, you walking today?  Those videos are pretty funny.  Yeah, I'm walking.  Let's walk together.  All right.  You want to hold hands?  Yeah, we did that the other day.  That was fun.  It was fun until we realized nobody was looking.  Last time Bobby was in, there's a bunch of fans outside.  We took pictures and stuff, whatever.  And then Bobby and I were walking the same way. 
[04:16:00]  So we're like, all right, see you guys.  And then we grabbed each other's hands and just walked on the sidewalk.  Fucking open hands.  I'll give you a little tip.  Never, ever do that with Club Soda Kenny, ever.  Why?  Because me and you, when it gets uncomfortable and the goof's over,  either one can break free, right?  Right.  Not with Kenny, man.  If you're going to play that game with him,  you're in for the long fucking haul.  I did it at an airport once, and he just refused to let go. 
[04:16:30]  And we walked through the entire terminal.  Squeezed my hand as hard as he can to make sure I couldn't break free.  It was not fun.  Gorilla grip.  All right.  Bobby, thank you.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  That's how we end.  Why don't we get Black Earl in here and see why he's so upset?  I think we all know, but it's always fun when he tries to explain himself.  He's got some rage.  T-minus 10 seconds before Earl Whedon could have been fine.  Oh, here comes Earl.  Earl, don't.  Oh, wait, wait. 
[04:17:00]  Earl.  Mark, go f*** yourself, okay?  You.  You.  All right, hold on.  What the hell is that?  Go f*** yourself, okay?  F*** you.  You.  All right, hold on.  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  Come and get it.  Does the three letters F-B-I mean anything to you?  Well, a truck gone broiled.  Meet you people, eh?  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  F-B-I.  What's the problem?  Ask Earl what's the problem.  What's the problem, Earl? 
[04:17:30]  Why are you angry?  Well, I'm just a little irritated, that's all.  So when I get irritated, I leave the situation.  Why did he slam the door?  He's not responding.  He's just sitting there kicking his feet.  He looks like he's going to kill somebody.  Earl, Earl.  Earl, Earl.  I don't know.  Does Earl realize how gay he sounds right now?  Right.  Kiss my ass.  Did the invisible man follow you out, Earl?  It's a pain in the ass.  That's what he's trying to do.  He gives me nothing to go with, and then yells at me for not knowing.  Says her to your turn to your turn to your turn.  Whoa.  Earl, calm down. 
[04:18:00]  No violence in this office.  Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  You calling me mental?  You calling me mental?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Earl, comment.  Guess what?  No one cares.  I'm famous, even though I'm not.  Who the F are you?  Gin, soap, cocaine-filled brain.  We're trying to, first of all, people are dying.  People are dead.  They're digging up dead.  They're trying to get in food, supplies, and other things. 
[04:18:30]  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  I didn't have any credentials to be down there.  We had no business being down there.  Just saying.  I'm an idiot.  And I'm stupid.  The place in the world for the angry young man.  With his working class ties and his radical plans.  He refuses to bend.  He refuses to crawl.  And he's always at home with his back to the wall.  And he's proud of the stars and the battles he's fought.  And he struggles and leads as he hangs on his cross.  And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  He's got always laminants.  He's like the Pope.  Are you trying to say the Pope has a lot of laminants? 
[04:19:00]  Yeah, I have never seen the Pope with laminants.  Earl, comment.  F*** you.  A moment or two to the angry young man.  With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand.  With stab in the back, he's been misunderstood.  It's a comfort to know his intentions are good.  And he sits in a room with a lock on the door.  With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor.  And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  Well, the mic was drooping down.  It would have slammed down on the board. 
[04:19:30]  That's why I was holding the microphone.  The age of consciousness and righteous rage.  I found that just surviving was a noble fight.  You ass.  I once believed in causes too.  I had my pointless point of view.  And life went on no matter who was wrong or right.  Guess what?  No one cares.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  And there's always a place for the angry young man.  With his fist in the air and his head in the sand.  And he's never been able to learn from mistakes. 
[04:20:00]  So he can understand why his heart always breaks.  And his honor is pure and his courage is wealth.  And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell.  And I'll go to the grave as an angry wolf.  It's a figure of speech.  What about the figure of speech?  Use that mass between your ears called your brain every once in a while.  You would know what that means.  You don't get it.  It's a federal disaster area.  This isn't a...  Whoa.  Earl, calm down. 
[04:20:30]  Earl, comment.  I'm the public service director.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  You take the goddamn beer, okay?  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  F*** you.  This is an old...  There's always a place for the angry young man.  With his working class ties and his radical plans.  He refuses to bend.  He refuses to crawl.  And he's always at home with his back to the wall.  And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost.  And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross.  And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 
[04:21:00]  Hey, how can a guy with no motion be in promotion?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm the public service director.  I'm famous even though I'm not.  Screw this.  Just stay away from you, Mark.  Because I guarantee you someone will get injured.  Yeah, Earl.  Earl, any final words?  Who the F are you?  You...  Ass.  Tell me where I'm going.  Whoa.  Earl, calm down.  You calling me mental...  What do you do?  Gin-so-cocaine-filled brain.  You...  Ass. 
[04:21:30]  Again, something you know nothing about.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  Your ass stinks just like everybody else's.  Just say it.  I'm an idiot.  And I'm stupid.  You...  Ass.  That's why I brought the fader down.  Screw this.  Go...  ... yourself, okay?  There he is.  Thank you, Earl.  Earl, thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  We look forward to your next phone call.  With great anticipation.  That's right.  Now, don't stop it.  No. </pre>
