<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent.  The show opened with a discussion of the Times Square bombing attempt and the BP oil spill.  The hosts mocked the media's coverage of the bombing, highlighting the arrest of Faisal Shahzad, and ridiculed proposed solutions to the oil spill offered by callers, contrasting them with expert opinions.  Jesse Ventura even called in to offer a conspiracy theory about the bombing.  The conversation meandered into discussions of beer, John Sterling's Yankees commentary, and Tiger Woods' infidelities.

The show then shifted to BP's ineffective response to the oil spill, which segued into a caller's description of a geological timeline at a natural history museum, emphasizing humanity's insignificance in the grand scheme of things.  This led to a graphic discussion of episodes of *Intervention*, detailing the drug use and traumatic experiences of featured addicts and their families.

Patrice O'Neal joined the show in studio. The conversation returned to the Times Square bombing, with the hosts and O'Neal criticizing the media and speculating on conspiracy theories involving global elites and a potential power grab.  The discussion encompassed the suspect's motives, government and media manipulation, and the possibility of social unrest.  Tangential topics included Oprah Winfrey's breasts and the perceived overreaction to the bombing.  The conversation continued into broader discussions of banks, the New World Order, the failures of communism, terrorism, and societal collapse. O'Neal shared personal beliefs, clarifying them as interpretations rather than definitive statements.  Dr. Ian Smith, a guest from *Celebrity Fit Club*, joined the discussion, criticizing the show's unrealistic depiction of weight loss.  The segment concluded with promotion of O'Neal's upcoming appearances and a rambling discussion about human nature, societal evolution, control, and freedom.  Offensive language and sexually suggestive comments were prevalent throughout.

A significant portion of the show focused on weight loss and reality TV, specifically *Celebrity Fit Club* and *The Biggest Loser*. The hosts criticized the shows' methods and exploitation of contestants, discussing various contestants, including Wendy Williams ("Snapple lady") and Harvey, a trainer from *Celebrity Fit Club*.  A bet between Ian and a guest, Iraq, regarding weight loss resulted in a confrontation demanding repayment of $500.  Ian Smith's book, "Happy," and his appearance on Rachel Ray's show were also mentioned.  Other topics included speculation about the personal lives of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, Chastity Bono, a discussion about a joke in Michael Strahan's sitcom *Brothers*, Ian's past conflict with Strahan's wife involving false accusations, and a recurring joke about Sam's biracial heritage.  The segment included the playing of Troy Kwan's song, "Side Pussy," and an apology from Patrice O'Neal for past behavior.  Uncle Paul's segment, characterized by racist remarks about baseball, was also referenced.

The final segment centered on "Furry Vengeance," featuring Patrice O'Neal and Jimmy "The Greek" O'Neal.  The discussion detailed their experiences filming, including Patrice's apparent displeasure and an unscripted act of throwing a water pipe at Brendan Fraser's car.  The authenticity of Brendan Fraser's hair was debated, along with vulgar and offensive comments.  Patrice also recounted accidentally urinating in his pants on set.  Listener calls shared their opinions of the film.  The hosts promoted upcoming events and engaged in further off-topic discussions about the NBA playoffs, the stock market, tattoos, and their views on various people and groups.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But I'm not saying the police should be able to walk into our houses and look through our computers because they suspect something.  That's an irrational giving up of a freedom.  I certainly hope not.  How are you giving up of freedom?  You're saying someday that may cause you to give up of freedom.  That's not what Ben Franklin said, whoever said it, Thomas Jefferson.  He didn't say that the prospect of someday of freedom being gone should endanger people now.  What Jefferson was saying is these cameras are bogus. 
[00:00:30]  And if we don't get them out of our streets, then we're just going to be bogus, too.  Rosanna Scott, oh yeah.  Should milk that's not from a cow be called milk?  What do you think?  Come!  Yes, sure, much milk is not from a cow.  Unless it's from someone's balls!  The fertilizer there was not of the correct grade to be a blasting agent grade high explosive.  And that's what's in the vial that appears on the table.  What is the point of explaining how to do this properly? 
[00:01:00]  They need something to say.  They feel impassable to learn what ammonium nitrate prills may in fact look like.  He didn't have ammonium nitrate prills.  He went and got fertilizer from wherever it was.  He got like horse shit.  How do they figure out how much damage this bomb took to the show?  Tapes of the show in the back of his truck.  He has a stinky truck.  He just thought fertilizer would work.  I know you don't drink beer often, but when you do, is it Dos Equis?  Dos Equis and Corona modelo. 
[00:01:30]  I love Corona.  I'm just trying to find out.  You're pretty interesting.  I know it's a wimpy beer, but I like that Corona.  I want to know what a strawberry is.  Strawberry?  A strawberry.  Oh, come on!  The guy's learned a whole nother language, Opie.  It really is amazing.  I don't speak any Spanish.  The guy speaks great English, and he misses an S, and we're like, you fucker.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next.

[00:15:00]  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  watching it oh you went to that site again huh oh well that's for your for your helping of hate  that's where i find a helping of hate i don't need helping i don't need a heap in helping of hate  i'm done no i i know you don't i'm done full i know you don't need help with hate  you got your helping oh so full yeah you enjoy a good helping of hate i like a good heap and 
[00:15:30]  helping of hate every right to the tippy top exactly get a good one get a good one was the  married with two kids three kids was he what a dummy was he i don't know i don't know there's  so much like erroneous information they said they took him and two other people off the plane  oh is that the plane actually uh yeah i was telling anthony the plane is on on live tv right now the  plane where they uh yanked this guy off of and i i said and if this was like the late 70s they would  yank the guy off and go all right take off yeah but no no they're gonna have that plane sit there 
[00:16:00]  probably for a month now a month yeah they're dusting everything for a month just to make sure  there's nothing else to it goes along with this thing so but that's great that he he almost thought  he was he was gone and how what what satisfaction on the part of the the feds just walking in there  and gone no asshole no oh i bet you thought you were getting away with it you think the feds are  sweating a little bit too going oh my god we can't lose this guy yeah hopefully lose him now and 
[00:16:30]  the story comes out that that plane took off right right right right yeah because you know  communication gets fucked up every so often yeah all of a sudden you follow the guy and he just ducks  into some whatever and you know where the fuck is the guy oh where'd he go and at every checkpoint  that guy's going oh my god all right i've made it through hit it through that all right i'm in the  airport all right that's good that's a good sign you think he was making jokes at security like  oh the shoes yes i always forget my cell phone in my pocket that's okay how are you  throw my water away can't take it through you're thirsty people right are you with me people like 
[00:17:00]  looking around trying to trying to acknowledge the other passengers who are just looking at him  like shut up or do you think he was just a sweaty mess and he just couldn't handle anything just like  yeah sweat running down his face and what about the it's a little warm in here what about the guy  they had on on uh camera yesterday it turns out he's just some dumb tourist changing his shirt that  was getting a little warm in time square and said you know what i'm gonna take one of these shirts  off in the alley no one's gonna notice no one'll notice he looks so evil too didn't he he really 
[00:17:30]  did look evil bomber he's guilty of something i think at this point they're saying the two aren't  connected right yeah they said that guy was just a guy that's just a guy just trying to fucking uh  get a little yeah a little cooler it was a hot day in time square i love new york t-shirt and  you think he was roughed up statue of liberty styrofoam hat to wear and i think he was roughed  up at home yesterday oh because until they knew we know it's you motherfucking working them over 
[00:18:00]  to a phone book retired nypd on the phone let's go to charlie staten island charlie charlie  there's probably about 13 or 15 bins on a car every major motor part transmission rear end has  a bin every body panel has a sticker with a bin on it and then what the factory does is they'll hide  bins in different places every year so uh people can't cut them and you know chop them and change 
[00:18:30]  the bins so it was kind of a waste of time that this guy erased one vin number off the car  absolutely yeah he probably thought he was going to have more time if the vehicle blew up it was  going to take him a little longer to find out where it came from and it would have given him more time  to get the fuck out of dodge right but uh that was not the case i would imagine the vin number is in the  computer system too somehow right the computer of your car uh that traces everything yeah i would  say it all depends on what year the car was i don't think it was a new one i don't think it was that 
[00:19:00]  old either though ant i mean yeah you know the computers have been in the cars for a while now  no all right thank you charlie all right oh this is a very adam in long island adam adam morning boys  hey uh anthony do you think that maybe he was asleep and the cops woke him up on the plane you know how  you know how it is when you get on that plane all of a sudden sometimes you can fall asleep real fast 
[00:19:30]  and yeah and you wake up a little bit when you realize oh my god all right we're taking off  am i in dubai that was the fastest flight i oh let me i can't believe they shut the door now i could just  relax i dream of being in friendly territory with other american haters  no don't tap me i don't want anything i just want to sleep i oh my god i'm the bomber and they caught me 
[00:20:00]  oh no i was going home  oh was it my note i left in vehicle if car does not explode please return to fazal shazad  is that his name yeah what's his name again fazal there it is fazal his name is exactly what we  thought it would be yeah open sesame i think we're all relieved it's not some stupid white guy 
[00:20:30]  right yeah just makes it a lot easier guy phil from connecticut it really does make it easier  it makes it a lot easier the hatred i had one day of reprieve i'm like you know what it's a white guy  good i'm happy it's a nut but nope no misbehaving again aren't you and the pakistani taliban said it  was you know they were responsible for it and this guy was in pakistan for five months he comes here  builds amongst the worst bombs ever how great is they blab before the guy's away yeah right it's 
[00:21:00]  like you might want to shut the fuck up yeah can i get home first dummies uh they're moving the plane  now or is it taking off finally then this thing ain't taking off today no that's it you think  that's it jesus this thing's been sitting there for hours you think those people they never let the  people get off right no i doubt it and how do they know there's not just full of terrorists  how do they know there's not another guy there the sacrificial lamb is gone i'll bet you that they  had to go over every passenger in that plane imagine osama bin laden's in the back row 
[00:21:30]  yeah we're just letting him go yeah letting him go oh fuck that was close you sure it's taking off  now uh it looks like officials looking at other possible suspects yeah because we don't know  what they learned uh all day yesterday i took a shitload of stuff out of his house too apparently  yeah after he left for the airport i think yeah yeah he left for the airport and they just went in  there hello we're searching every nook and cranny by the way i'd love to know who the guy next to him

[00:22:30]  guy was ripped out of the plane hey you come here yeah because all the pleasantries were gone at that  point let's get this fucker off this plane now they probably just made an announcement if anybody's  on board who knows anything about the bombing in times square please come to the front of the plane  uh he felt guilty anthony we have jesse ventura on the line what jesse hello boy jimmy hello  the fertilizer the fertilizer was placed by government agents it was a syntax grade horse shit

[00:24:30]  the ichiban yeah yeah it's a new bit i'm working on gotta get a sound effect for that though that's  not a bad idea yeah i kind of like that it means number one kind of like that idea yeah  all right so there's your excitement for them for the morning we got the guy yeah see at that  plane ain't taking off yeah it is it's on the runway are you sure sure looks like it  it's taxing where is it going where is it going oh oh wait is this it is he goosing it looks like 
[00:25:00]  he's goosing it a little bit come on no imagine this plane crashes oh my god they just they just  saved this guy's life oh shit how much would that suck yeah that thing's now this thing is going  taking off all right this plane's going to dubai why show the plane with the guy not on now it's  just a plane taking off because they want to they want to be dramatic like see this is what would  have happened if they didn't take him off the plane he would have been on there he would have been on 
[00:25:30]  there taking off he would have got away there it is i bet that's nice in there the first class on  emirates is like they have like little cabins to yourself but that's fantastic yeah first class  emirates this guy doesn't play games yeah nobody here it's wow look at that that's a 767 or 777  how the fuck do they figure that out it's just the miracle of flight how do they figure that out  i want the boys down the hall to get the local news because i guarantee they're going to spin this 
[00:26:00]  differently like you know he almost got away they were about to take off maybe they're showing this  because they got that guy in a room somewhere watching it hey there goes your plane fucko  like wouldn't you just love to fuck with him like that some veteran nypd guys yeah  a asshole asshole it goes your fucking plane get a good look hey which seat was yours huh  which window did he have a window seat yeah because they take another phone book to the 
[00:26:30]  side of his head let's go wham big fucking fat phone book right to the solar plexus  hey did you have one of those nice first class seats yeah i bet you did huh someone else is in  that fucker now look at this fucking first class seats they're amazing it's like your own little  cabin your own little fucking rest area it's small though where they no that's so fucking  terrorist nice look at that room you need yeah what the hell is that about uh speaking of planes 
[00:27:00]  anthony did you hear about sully uh i think i think it's in the wall street journal today but  they're talking about it on all the news stations that his landing might have been a little dramatic  and and and there certainly were other options they're starting to say they're not what they're  starting to say because they i think they're finally filing uh the report of everything all that  info they gather and they're basically saying that maybe he didn't have to land in the river after  all like he had enough room he had he had options could have restarted or or made it to any of the 
[00:27:30]  local airports i gotta get the actual article but they're basically saying maybe he didn't have to do  that after all i think sully knows best sully knew best what are you gonna do of course they gotta  ruin everything like that story it's a perfect story but of course what they gotta knock it down a  notch or two and go i don't know they're saying he actually could have made it to his destination  right exactly uh look at that this is a very good question on it hey fucker there's your plane 
[00:28:00]  fucker paul in connecticut paul yeah what's going on hey there paul now can you imagine you being the  one of the other passengers on this plane and it's okay everything's fine we're gonna take off now  uh no i don't think so i'll wait for the next plane thank you very much  i'm thinking yeah i think i'd be a little nervous like you're sure none of these other guys on here  yeah right uh but that's that's but that's a plane ride where people want to you know i think get 
[00:28:30]  away pretty secure plane though wouldn't be me i'll wait for the next one you know what i think that's  a pretty safe plane they probably checked everybody on it yeah yeah that's been sitting there a while  yeah so the plane is in the air and it's gone now so wow they could still fucking do bye  and what he's appearing in federal court today yeah here in new york city god they're still  showing it how high is that thing why just keep showing it i know yeah what what is there to say 
[00:29:00]  torturing the guy and you can still love if they were showing it you can still read it yeah you can  still read the side of the plane it took off a couple minutes ago right now the cops are telling  right now they're hearing that little do that little do do do do all right this is your cabinet  speaking uh welcome aboard uh emirates flight to dubai um we're flying terrorist free now  uh so uh relax feel free to uh walk around the cabin and uh thank you for flying we'll be uh getting to 
[00:29:30]  dubai um and by the way the terrorist ha ha ha you're in jail anthony here it is about sully  thought he had it so close here here we got on sully uh uh so the uh the report's coming out today  and basically this little piece is in there but tucked inside thousands of pages of testimony and  exhibits are hints that in hindsight the celebrated pilot could have made it back to la guardia airport  um pilots who use uh simulators to recreate the accident including suddenly losing both engines 
[00:30:00]  after sucking in birds at 2500 feet repeatedly managed to safely land their virtual airliners at la  guardia it's a lot easier to do that in a simulator though and that's probably the second the birds  hit like he's talking to towers finding out if he can do that like if you're in a simulator you could  probably there's birds all right let's go back right not getting on the radio and going ah we got a bird 
[00:30:30]  strike uh you know where are you directing me to right in hindsight yeah because you know exactly what's  wrong with this plane yeah you know this happened like dot dot dot to the guy and i'm sure he did not  want to be over uh buildings and shit well this guy in uh flushing sean in flushing how's it going  hey hey man i flew the uh same exact route in a uh faa certified simulator it would have been very 
[00:31:00]  difficult to make it back to any of the airports safely i felt like it was just too risky yeah see  what are these people talking about party poopers let's sully have his fucking day alone it's you know  you know how much lift you lose to during a fucking a turn that what he would have to make to get back  to la guardia probably would have to make a tight turn those are happening the turns we're going to  mess everything up yeah every time you make a turn you're losing fucking lift and he's got no power i  don't know i think he what the fuck how are you going to argue this guy fucking saved everybody's 
[00:31:30]  life now one person i think that a320 could have been in the fucking in the buildings in  fucking queens i think one person had a sprained ankle that was this i think you did a pretty damn good  job exactly thank you sir let's go to chris in south carolina chris hey hey what's going on guys  what's up hey the reason that plane took so long to take off they had to resell that seat  to get the guy 50 bucks back for his extra bag yeah imagine we need to take it off that's a 
[00:32:00]  fucking you know that's money for us money we gotta wait they go to a standby line holy  shit it's my lucky day they're all just terrorists standing on standby holding bombs  and stuff yeah they got like the old-fashioned cartoon round bomb with the fuse hello the spy  versus spy bomb yeah the spy versus spy bomb didn't they do that in airplane too where everyone just  had fucking weapons and weapons yeah going through security was it that was it a security scene in  them because i remember something like that uh let's go to wood floor liquor what's up bro hey 
[00:32:30]  man hey guys how you doing good can we stop being a fucking nation of  fucking nitpicky hallmongers the guy saved a shitload of people's lives by landing in the hudson  can we maybe figure out how to make planes safer instead of ripping apart the heroes  yeah i kind of agree with you yeah i did hear it on the news today so i figured i'd bring it to  the show but yeah it's a pretty shitty article it is a shitty article you're right you're right 
[00:33:00]  all he did was ruin a plane he's a bum yeah he banged up their plane yeah if i was them i would  sue him and demand the money for those imagine yeah imagine now they're gonna fucking force him to  pay for the plane he gets a multi-million dollar bill yeah what the fuck is this for a plane idiot  dry cleaning it uh all right that's good people are monitoring uh the local news for us and actually  you guys could help us out with this because we just gave you all the facts about the the suspect 
[00:33:30]  but i know the news is going to get all dramatic with this saying where we were really lucky to  catch him the plane almost took off with him in it and that's just not true we know that they were  following him all day yesterday to find out who else was involved and uh who says pete pete writes fox  news reporting it on us so far so all right check out the other uh news channels and see who's not  reporting it honestly are they fair and balanced i guess they're being fair and balanced on this the  no spin zone  no spin what else is going on my goodness we talked about the phillies fan being tased oh speaking of 
[00:34:00]  baseball uh do we have the john sterling fucking call yeah what's the guy's name who hit the home run  i don't think we have it yet something yeah it's there oh here yeah it's okay it's probably  something about winning ways and this guy uh not not not a big home run hitter or anything you know  he uh is he a is he a starter i don't even know crack one his name's randy win what does he do for  the yankees in is he a starter does he what position uh what do we got you know what uh this isn't one 
[00:34:30]  of your more popular yankees okay he's new this year yeah this year he's an outfielder he's he's been  around for a while but uh john sterling gets very excited when the new guys come up because he has  to figure out a brand new home run call for yeah for all the new guys and uh this one uh happened  last night game winning homer no no okay which makes this call stupid as hell oh so we had half a  game to go yeah huh who did they play last night the orioles yeah uh-huh trap dog uh-huh if you guys 
[00:35:00]  played boston all year uh you'd be in first place i know be great we've won half our games  against but occasionally you have to run into the yankees sorry why don't we have the yankees  score in front of us here you don't want to write that down because you're an orioles fan it should  be on the sports sheet that the interns give you it was four to one i hate the sports sheet all right  no one looks at the sports sheet by the way no it's just too complicated no one looks sports 
[00:35:30]  shit it has like european european soccer scores i don't need that exactly it was a close four to  one it's a waste of paper yeah oh really this is why you got to read the whole article ihop waiter  yes oh yes uh ob i'm here at the ihop and uh underneath one of your maple syrup stains it also  mentions that lee is a fantastic pilot despite what the reports may say despite what everyone 
[00:36:00]  may infer he still did his best it's okay that you missed it though it was next to the coffee stain  underneath the maple syrup look he's assuming you got your info from the uh look man on the place  matt who really reads more than the first two paragraphs of any story exactly they got to get  all the info in those first two paragraphs because then it trails off after that and uh real quick  info for trap dog uh no uh the orioles haven't won half their games against boston they've won  seven games so they've actually won four against boston trap you're cutting yourself a little short 
[00:36:30]  even better than more than half that's nice all right thank you sir let's get to this home run call  john sterling being douchey and the right-hander deals swung on a high drive the deep right center it is  high it is far it is gone in the yankees bullpen a three-run home run for randy he helps the yankees 
[00:37:00]  win and the yankees now take a 4-1 lead well thanks thanks for the jinx uh that would have been a  i would have been like what the fuck is he helps the yankees win but it's the bottom of the fourth or  something like they're not even they hadn't won yeah no that doesn't make sense if it was a game  winning home run by the guy he's yeah that would have been for a walk-off and that still would have  sucked but at least it would have made sense yeah helps the yankees win helps the yankees win get it 
[00:37:30]  win that doesn't make sense if the game's still going on it's terrible all right he's trying so  hard just way too hard keep up your good nature now why don't we take an early break today because  that's our big story the freaking uh the freaking suspect being uh arrested oh he was  u.s citizen from pakistan miracle on the hudson and that's oh yeah yeah yeah final report to be 
[00:38:00]  issued from miracle on the hudson they'll probably arrest sully it's something he was looking at  kitty porn as he was taking off so i flew into the birds all these things you never found out no sam's  running in though sam what do you got a report from the news oh what are they being dramatic  see overly dramatic keep on this man yeah the media really sucks they're not accurate with 
[00:38:30]  their reporting whatsoever they're all about making you watch longer and they don't give a  shit if they get their basic facts uh wrong or exaggerate them this is how nbc in new york started  the thing good morning michael and you might call this the suspect that almost got away authorities say  the man who tried to blow up that car in times square is 30 year old faisal shazad he didn't almost get  away almost got away get me a million of these today i'm looking for him he did not and they 
[00:39:00]  they know this i found my stupid info on on twitter and they they got better ways of gathering the news  at nbc they got reporters they fucking know that they were trailing the guy all day yesterday so how  did he almost get away how long have you been following faisal that's probably who yeah i'm  plain now yeah exactly exactly he probably has a twitter account i'm playing lol 
[00:39:30]  and safe to say within i don't know three hours they knew exactly who this guy was four hours of when  when the whole thing went down in times square i don't think it was that they probably had a  a very good idea once they ran that number and talked to within a day they knew yeah yeah all  right we're up to tuesday so let's say the first 48 hours let's say they knew sometime sunday that's  two days so how did the guy almost get away if they're trailing him basically for two days yeah 
[00:40:00]  and i'm sure they really made a point of not letting them out of his him out of their sights of  of course ridiculous they knew he was going to be on that plane you dummies how did they figure  that one out yeah just lucked out they let him get on the plane right so they could see who else  was involved if anyone else is involved what he was doing you know but it seems like they knew that  he was going to the airport before they started following him to the airport he was seconds away  from the plane taking off really no he wasn't no i don't think so no i don't think so either 
[00:40:30]  how do we how do we how do we report the news better than fucking news stations how is that  possible they want to be overly dramatic all right chop chop quick break we'll continue opening  ozzy right yeah this is uh the new one no no no this is a miracle man um great song but you'll be 
[00:41:00]  swagger i don't know this one what album how old a few years man a fucking uh wow what album don't  don't tell me it's not off no more tears uh no rest of the wicked ozzy uh doing a little oz fest this  summer yes six dates wow camden's as close as it gets to us though i think that's pretty close yeah  that's where we would go ozzy motley crew and rob halford will headline six date oz fest tour 
[00:41:30]  that's pretty cool that faggot's gonna be playing nice i don't like that type of talk  rob's coming back in i know he's playing that audio for he's not denying the fact that uh  he digs the cock i think he wants you to tone it down a little bit he loves because all right i'll  admit some things but all right what he was admitting a lot he was being a genuine queen when  he was sitting here jesus the guy was such a fruit he's kind of all in huh he really is  what the hell i'm all in he came flying out of the closet boy did he you know i want to 
[00:42:00]  good for him i want to i want to punch william shatner square in the forehead  why right between the eyes would be nice a story came out yesterday that story he has made 600  million six hundred million dollars from priceline stock oh yeah i don't know what happened to that  stock he's made 600 million fucking dollars from priceline up to two like 260 bucks a share 270 
[00:42:30]  holy shit he's made more he's made more with priceline in the last what 10 years probably he's  been associated with that than his entire acting career where's that low dip uh danny what how much  was it then uh let's see here a dollar 49 a dollar 49 january 6 2003 2003 yeah yeah but that other dip  is when they all lost their money yeah that's all lost their money to that other one that's the one 
[00:43:00]  where we watched a lot of people lose a shitload of money and then the big dip is a spike because you  see the first fucking line that's when it went public what did they get on their shares  i mean i can't about  if it's right because it's i've never seen numbers like that on a stock before but it was like  scraping a thousand dollars it's yeah it was it was crazy and that was almost a thousand dollars a  share yeah and then we went down to like nothing one of our one of our favorite stories uh priceline 
[00:43:30]  goes public and and they invite a bunch of people including william shatner and me and aunt and a few  other uh dopes to kind of like talk as they were doing their huge we are millionaires party  where was that it was in a big like warehouse and all these fucking douches were walking around like  the tuxedos on toasting themselves with some crystal and they were nobodies like us and next  thing you know they're fucking multi-millionaires and we're up there entertaining them a little 
[00:44:00]  bit we had to like fucking shake some hands and stuff all paper millionaires is what they were  paper millionaires but they were walking around like look at me i'm a fucking rich motherfucker  yeah because everybody at press line was being paid in stock right so even you know the mail clerk  right was a millionaire everybody yeah it was and we we walked around yeah and then the thing uh  just dropped hard tanked it tanked twice but it's been on the way up ever since yeah now it's 
[00:44:30]  back up in the mid 200s i mean it's up there where apple is if you're a workout guy and you were  going to do some time on a bike or a treadmill that would be a nice fucking workout it's a good  workout uh graph right there you know slowly but surely going up those hills oh yeah go down a little  go back up the hill go down a little bit go a little higher up the hill yeah but at one point  your heart falls out to your asshole yeah but um yeah this graph is nine months of priceline 
[00:45:00]  activity when it first went public uh so you get you got 550 almost 600 a share to uh down by 12 11  bucks yeah that's nine eleven dollars a share so we took solace in the fact that a lot of those  millionaires we were walking around with yep didn't do the right thing and sell at the right time so a  lost most of their fortune i wonder how many sold when it was that low thinking it wasn't going to  come back and now they're sitting there going if i only would have held i would have just hung in  there somebody bought high uh yeah sold really low and didn't get back in and just killed themselves 
[00:45:30]  yeah yeah that's right shannon made uh over half a billion uh 600 million dollars wow from priceline  stock rich in illinois what's going on rich hey guys how you doing hey i just wanted to bring up  uh how the news not only being douchebags about catching this guy but uh they're helping these  fuckers what if this if this guy is like part of a bigger cell all they did with their fucking  coverage was show in time square that you know where the people are going to mass when there's 
[00:46:00]  a bomb down there where they're going to get the best kill zones of any other secondary so they put  together some bullshit amateur bomb and sit back and watch the fucking news i don't believe they did a  a bullshit amateur one though i i don't think they would give up an opportunity because that  thinking the government has been very effective and the cops have been very effective in stopping  things there really has been a lot of amazing police work like we've gotten lucky a few times  well we got lucky on this one a lot of people say wow you know good police work and i love the nypd and 
[00:46:30]  all that but the fact is the thing was smoking that should have been an explosion right yes if that was  the explosion there would have been oh no and i agree i agree they wouldn't miss an opportunity so  yes it could have blown up but this is like the second best thing it's like yeah it didn't blow up  right but you know what since it didn't let's just sit back and see where everybody runs to where  everybody stands around and looks you put secondaries in all those locations and you're just going  to like triple your fucking body count on the thing but um i had this thought on the airplane i just 
[00:47:00]  pictured this guy getting on the airplane thinking he's scot-free and then fucking chris hanson walking out of  first class sit down exactly sit down have some hummus  nice very very good buddy all right well they're aggressively going after new york city  isn't this four in the last thing but what are the numbers on this subway i just got distracted  and then this there's been a few yeah that they've thwarted thwarted big fan of the word thwart it's 
[00:47:30]  a great word thwarted there's nothing worse when you're trying to get laid and you're thwarted yeah  they don't want to be thwarted but they're they're aggressively going after new york city and  you just know i think it's in the back of all new yorkers heads that it's gonna happen you're  just hoping you're not in that area when it does yeah although the more they stop i'll say this the  more they stop and the more people they disrupt i really think they've done a lot of damage  to the ability to commit these acts because they should have had suicide bombers already here just 
[00:48:00]  running into play that they don't this is everything from predator drones taking out leadership of uh  al-qaeda and taliban overseas all the way to just you know a cop on the street everything in between  too we've really apparently the united states has has really taken this seriously as well they should  and uh they're working together a little more i like that and um you know you don't have agencies 
[00:48:30]  fighting over whose responsibility this is and that and uh you get results apparently so yeah it's been  working a lot of bad reports coming out about taliban kills they said they caught the american taliban  spokesman adam gaddan that scumbag and then and they don't he's not caught this guy's not really oh no  they keep thinking they kill people alzarkawi a long time ago there was a report like long before  he was actually killed there were reports that he was actually killed they just continue to report 
[00:49:00]  like they on hearsay they're just reporting it and then it turns out to be nonsense unbelievable  all right moving on moving on to the other big story the oil spill holy shit it's gonna what is  it it's gonna hit the uh they're saying oil expected to hit loop current in florida in 24 hours  that doesn't sound good no that doesn't sound good if it's gonna current hit the loop current i  think that means it could hit the florida keys too they're saying oh which would really  fuck it up yeah the florida oh my god just think of all the fucking free lube though that you could 
[00:49:30]  ass fuck each other with apparently florida keys very gay yes it is but would they really go into the  ocean just to get motor oil on their dicks probably fair point they're just lube up yeah  get fucked up and come out of the water like a sea monster and get to some  fucking you're just all horned up looking like one of those poor otters yeah 
[00:50:00]  some wildlife persons washing your cock off with dawn with their mouth  why does it have to go there we're so bad they got cleaning fluid in their mouth  i'm volunteering to help clean wildlife and cocks  ah shit when is the spill gonna uh stop leaking there now they're saying a few more days i thought  they said three months where are we at with this well they really don't know they can't be sure they're 
[00:50:30]  putting this dispersant uh right into the oil as it's coming out of the rig they usually uh  put it over the the oil slick but they're like trying to put it on it as it even comes out of that  that uh hole in the in the bottom of the ocean that we opened up and it's what it's a mile down right  yeah and it uh it seems to break up the oil and makes it disperse better what about um  um i was watching uh they light some of it on fire i was watching handy last night yeah you're 
[00:51:00]  doing handy this week uh jimmy's doing it tonight yes and i will be on handy on thursday nice so dumb  i am i knew i was doing red eye last night i forgot i was doing handy tonight i'm like i  thought i was doing on a monday for some reason look at you you're a tv whore i just forgot what  i just spread it out a little bit i didn't realize it was doing it tonight i'm like you know what it is  if sean wants me i mean you gotta go sean calls yeah no they've been very uh uh i think sean was  saying that we had an opportunity to what burn the fuel as it was on the top of the water or 
[00:51:30]  something yeah they know anything about that they were doing that a little bit now they're yelling  and screaming at each other going why didn't we do this they were uh they were they were they were  burning some of it but um i don't know that doesn't seem like a very effective way of doing it  it we got fucked up the environment man man we're just fucking up the environment man  we do a horrible job of taking care of ourselves as humans we really do man yeah we just suck 
[00:52:00]  so really are terrible at it not that i care you should care a little no just a little bit like  jimmy said it's just like fucking you know the earth taking a shit when he said the oil that came  from the earth that's liquid diarrhea we didn't ship it in from the moon it's i know it's oil they act  like it's fucking like it's saturn dust it's oil do you think the earth has never had oil in the water 
[00:52:30]  volcano just fuck it's vomiting the earth throws up volcano into the fucking ocean we're worried a few  gulls have fucking oil hats fuck them one less thing they'll be shitting on punks i do get confused  because we we make we we take shit out of the ground and we make stuff and then we throw it away and now  all of a sudden we're polluting the earth right but it came from the earth so what's the difference  in the end it's only pollution if you make it out of something that's not from earth yeah you know  like if you throw out your fucking moon rock pie you're littering 
[00:53:00]  how awful would moon rock pie be if you're the hat made of comet material and you toss it out  you're polluting the earth but everything came from stars anyway so yeah yeah it's not there's no  pollution really 71 of earth is water yeah what's that ship i was just gonna say everything came from  stars what do you mean it's like the showtime network uh the movie channel right uh jason west virginia  yeah jason yeah or something what do you got jason hey what's up guys hey hey uh that that whole 
[00:53:30]  thing in the gulf with uh with the bop failing the sheer rams failing is like next to impossible  uh you got to have a catastrophic failure of the bop to have that happen so to have it leaking like  that uh there was a person who's operating the diverter and the only reason he probably didn't hit  is because he's been drilled into the head environmental impact of oil release and all 
[00:54:00]  that so he probably didn't hit it and then it had a catastrophic failure which ruptured the sheer  rim oh my god you know well see the problem is when that happens uh if they've had a catastrophic failure  in the bop you know the that's a blowout preventer right that's supposed to seal up  right so if that doesn't work the best way well if they can't get it to stop they're going to have to  probably eventually use a cryogenic freezing which is where they go down and inject it around the pipe 
[00:54:30]  and usually the methane that's engaged in the gas will uh turn into methane hydrate at that pressure  and temperature and then they seal it off break the bop off and weld it shut from there if that's even  possible that's pretty much where they're at now yeah you know what we need what we need uh the team  of drillers from armageddon that's what we need because they could do anything solution right there 
[00:55:00]  they can do anything that is the solution yep exactly steve buscemi all right jason thank you all  all right guys punch now later steve buscemi get him down there oh god yeah it's my it's my tags you  guys hear about tiger woods and his awful pickup line no what was he just opens his bank book here  bitch oh jim his awful joke the tiger woods pickup line oh the attention whore is back in the news of 
[00:55:30]  course she is she wanted to uh she had a reservation at the ritz carlton the last pga uh tournament was  what quail hill or whatever and tiger didn't make the cut but he was playing in the tournament and all  of a sudden her reservation got canceled and she thinks it was tiger because tiger might have been  staying at the ritz carlton as well and the only reason she was down there was because she wanted to  dance at a club yeah of course more attention she's basically following tiger woods uh whatever 
[00:56:00]  fucking tournament he does she's finding a strip club nearby to just get a little more attention for  herself you know what she is i hate her more than all of them i could not agree more she's the  equivalent of a vd as far as i'm concerned wow she just she just is there it's like you fucked her  and then she won't go away and it lingers it's like fucking beat it  fucking beat it go already no one cares anymore it's so enraging it's like why don't you just go  back to fucking for a living right that's what you do and the good news i mean her little story was 
[00:56:30]  on page like 85 so it's you know they're moving her out of the paper quickly uh tiger's pickup line  a joke tiger woods has used the same off-color joke as a as a pickup line for at least a decade  and this is what he does what is it what's this he says it points to his cock uh does he he goes  what's this as he's rubbing the tips of his shoes together oh okay you've heard this one before  no i haven't either a black guy taken off his condom it's a pretty funny one a huge big big 
[00:57:00]  cock it's kind of funny but he uses it a lot you better have the goods to back it up well everyone's  saying he had the goods to back it up all right tiger he told the joke in 1997 in front of a gq  reporter that's good and even though he took flack for it then he was still using it in 2006 when he  hit on exotic dancer cory wrist she says in an interview in the new vanity fair wrist uh r-i-s-t  who became one of woods's many mistresses said he then invited her to come up to the apartment 
[00:57:30]  of a superstar ballplayer where he had a room the sex was passionate fireworks she told the magazine  afterwards woods liked to eat fruit loops and watch cartoons he is a dummy isn't he he is just a  adult who can play golf he's a dummy that's fruit loops and cartoons that doesn't sound good  you couldn't do anything more idiotic after sex after you got rid of the poison though sounds kind  of good little fruit loops and some cartoons why not loops and cartoons what a moron god forbid 
[00:58:00]  he should watch the news he's an idiot he really is a dope uh but when they were apart he would  become as possessive as a schoolboy over his first crush she said woods was so jealous in fact  that he asked porn star jocelyn james that's the one we were just talking about another mistress to  give up uh the business james said remember she was supposed to give up porn yeah like tiger would  actually say give up porn uh the golfer became obsessed with uh with all her adult film scenes 
[00:58:30]  and internet appearances said james who claims to have tutored him in extreme sex  he probably just got tired of fucking her after a three-day shoot  and i was just like yeah fruit loops cartoons well just the you know the badge was probably a  fucking a disaster when she'd show up oh she'd meet him in florida and then she had a  fucking pussy lip tucked in each sock and he's probably like you're gonna have to give uh the  business up you're gonna have to let the swelling go down a little bit yeah this is awful right  ties her lips around his balls like a cock ring okay lemons lemonade he would lick our 
[00:59:00]  pussy and then tie the lips around his head like mumps wrap  why do they do that for mumps mumps i don't get it but who's had mumps in the past  fucking that's old school 60 years mumps let me uh go to tom in pennsylvania tom hey there tam 
[00:59:30]  hey you know everyone has these exotic solutions to the soil problem you know how about a little  common sense when we figure out a way to attach the pipe and then pump it up to the top where we  can deal with it and then cap it yeah let's go let's yeah let's go get another mile long pipe  yeah you can do that like in in a day yeah no problem where are we getting this pipe from tom  well you know they they put a pipe on it in alaska you don't think they don't have the capability 
[01:00:00]  to obtain pipe and use it you know how long it would take to get another rig there and it's a mile  down yeah but they're gonna need a really big boat to get that pipe there yes  if we had a mile long pipe just laying around if we didn't have a mile long pipe then we're gonna  have to build a mile long pipe and that's going to take a long time like and just said yeah  but they got to have that somewhere or they should have had a plan b 
[01:00:30]  for plan b there's there's one plan we're pumping oil out of the ocean  and if that fucks up then you come up with uh plan b the slick is the size of delaware  yeah you think that's going to cause some problems could be an issue they have plan b it's called that  fucking valve that's supposed to click and shut the goddamn thing off just pull the goddamn plug  yeah how come whopper isn't shutting it off hello joshua hello joshua tom walker's through this because 
[01:01:00]  maybe we're the dummies today we got to find a mile long pipe right where are we going to find the  mile long pipe well there's hoses and stuff you don't have a lot of pressure on it all you're  doing is like a big vacuum cleaner so get a big vacuum cleaner we'll get a giant vacuum cleaner  we get the giant vacuum cleaner from uh austin powers i believe dr evil had a giant vacuum cleaner 
[01:01:30]  as he was trying to suck uh the um water off of the planet right yeah we can get all that sand  off the ocean floor too yeah yeah might as well messy oh we're at it tom big vacuum cleaner  what's going to be worse just uh pissing it out into the ocean and polluting everything  or trying to contain it don't you think it don't you don't you think if we could  contain it we would have it would have been a lot less of a hassle for bp  there's not a lot of people that like bp right now there's a lot of people very angry at bp so if 
[01:02:00]  they could contain it they certainly would have yeah but you know what when when you get these  eggheads talking about trying to freeze it and deal with it then you know maybe they're they're just so  twisted up in their technological solutions that they are missing the common sense solution no need  for name calling so the common sense solution is a big vacuum or a big pipe which one we go with  what do you want pipe vacuum some sort of tube come on if we can tunnel from england 
[01:02:30]  to uh europe yeah we could do that but that took decades yeah i think a lot of oil would be pumping  out yeah there's things we could do that are pretty amazing but they take decades this isn't like the  little stream of oil that uncle jed got after he was shooting at some food this is fucking like  pouring gallons out of his mother how many gallons a day oh barrels just thousands of gallons a day  thousands of barrels yeah pouring out of this fucking thing tom i you know we're pretty much 
[01:03:00]  fucked on this one  yeah although although jack p is suggesting that we uh get a a big vacuum and a mile-long pipe from some  uh some emporium ted's big vacuum and mile-long pipe i don't have any mile-long pipe i went down to  two foot pipe i said i want to sell you 27 000 units how much are they each 35 a piece wow but there's 
[01:03:30]  you have to twist them to make them go together and then the size of a straw very inconvenient certainly  is yeah how are you gonna use that to get rid of this i have a rowboat in a cup i'll take care of  it yeah that's good oil spill clean coming up should we hire you you certainly should to clean up the oil  mess i've been out there already i'm scolding the birds they're stealing oil on their fur  that's right the birds are stealing oil on their fur i actually have some honors out there i said get 
[01:04:00]  some of this on you and we'll drain it and make a lot of money they just they just looked at me and died  you know i i i think i finally got the solution though get a whole shitload of bread crumbs those  stupid birds will think they're getting a nice little feast and let them soak up the oil with  their fucking wings they'll soak it up yeah they die yeah it's easy to get the oil they wash up on  shore you pick them up you throw them away you ring them out over your fucking engine yeah get a 
[01:04:30]  fucking net with a funnel hold on uh this is not a bad idea rich the trucker rich yes i was going to  suggest a uh a large cork from ted's cork emporium wow well i don't know if that's possible i don't  think uh ted has a cork emporium yet no ted certainly doesn't he doesn't he's not going to hurt his throat  for that awful suggestion let's say hi to derek in georgia derek now derek he can fix this problem 
[01:05:00]  you know somebody had to have been sitting there and just gone uh whoops yeah there's somebody  that's responsible for this yes we should find his twitter page or something and see if we can blow  it up there's there's one guy that you think he's fired so fired someone's gotta be so fired like uh  there's one guy that's responsible for this and everyone forgot this was a rig that blew up and 11  people died that's right we're not worried about the 11 people i forgot about that now it's just this 
[01:05:30]  giant friggin complete fucking oil just pumping out of out of the gulf yeah unbelievable i wonder  if he just did one of those where he's just like uh well maybe if i don't say anything nobody will  notice yeah and if you recall there's more conspiracies that could come out of this one  yeah because if you uh recall uh president obama had just said we're gonna blame obama we're gonna  start no uh we're gonna start drilling offshore and uh people are like oh good we don't depend as 
[01:06:00]  much on foreign oil which could be good for this country right and then all of a sudden within days  this happens uh and now they've suspended the whole time square bomb alert cnn they just caught  him at the last second they didn't they didn't they followed him for a day this is the this is so  irresponsible sorry but as this breaks because we want to point out that they're just uh being liars 
[01:06:30]  on the news today dummies they laid out the whole story where they've been following the guy that they  followed him through security they watched him sit outside his gate they they had this whole situation  under control he was not getting away no sorry no that's her uh the uh conspiracy it is so this  blows up right and uh a bunch of oil is spurting everywhere and now um makes it harder to get this  in place well now they're saying they're not going to drill right until they figure out what the problem 
[01:07:00]  was how it could be solving you know this will take forever so again we go back to being completely  dependent on foreign oil and uh uh you could say maybe people in very high positions saudis the  people that make money while we're for the saudi could have been responsible how are they responsible  how did how did they get on that rig i don't know could you know this is one of these terrorism  things where somebody goes on with something this could be thermite paint ah i'm thinking i'm just i'm 
[01:07:30]  just doing a uh you know in a little submersible a bill burr type conspiracy thing yeah and then they  uh yeah and then the uh rig blower oh yeah dude dude the banks the banks god it's the british guy  oh yeah you know the rig just blows up i mean come on come on he he would definitely have a conspiracy 
[01:08:00]  theory about this but it's like it's like bill's nuts because it's like you have a great life you have a  great career how is anything the housing market you pay your rent what are you talking about  i love bill he's out of his mind he is crazy he's truly nuts let's go to dan in connecticut dan  hey i just want to say that tom guy sounds like an ass with the engineering experience of a lego  playset he's talking about building a mile of underwater piping like you can get it next to the pvc at a home 
[01:08:30]  depot yeah that's what i'm saying let's go to home depot pick it up it's a quick fix with a mile long  pipe and a big vacuum or something and then just put a toilet on top of it and just keep flushing  oh that's not a flush the oil back into the earth that's not a bad idea that's my idea i like it  uh oh that's good let's go to eric in main eric opie how you doing buddy what's up eric so i heard  they one idea they had was to to put some cement into to just kind of lock up the where the oil was 
[01:09:00]  coming out but it's not only a mile down to the ocean floor they'd have to drill two miles into the  earth to get to the source of the oil so the source is three miles down so that's even a longer pipe  how how low did it burst though wait a minute how did they figure that shit out so the pipe is a mile  down to the ocean floor and then it's another two miles to the oil is that they had to drill  through that yeah yeah they still got to drill through the ground it's not just laying there 
[01:09:30]  on the bottom of the ocean how the fuck you figure that out and you know what the pipe has to hit the  oil what if your calculations were wrong that's a big mistake yeah it certainly is that's one they  said that that it would be hard to get to that spot but even if they could it's like a four-month  project yeah if they get it right if they get it right okay if they get it right so where did the  break actually take place though what part of the thing did the burst what happened i i have no idea  but it must have been somewhere pretty fucking deep it broke off very close to the the ocean floor 
[01:10:00]  right right at that point but um yeah it didn't break off wait so the pipe goes another two miles  after the ocean yeah yeah how the fuck do they figure that shit out i don't know they do all  kinds of weird tests so you're in a dumb boat right to be there you work for bp or whatever  you're in a dumb boat and you know okay yeah there's oil down right here i think that i don't  how do they figure that out i don't think they just poke holes randomly no i know that but how the  fuck do they figure that out they got these geologists that are like fucking geniuses and all 
[01:10:30]  kinds of the geologists satellite and and uh electrical um uh what do they use like sonar and all  kinds of fucked up so you got a geologist on a boat yeah and now he's like okay it's all rocky  here and the boat's moving around a little bit and the oil's right here oil's here and does someone  save the spot until they could get all their big big time equipment out there you get out of here  this is our oil it's kind of fucked up because this it seems so simple that this blew up and there's oil 
[01:11:00]  coming out but i mean i know as much about oil rigging as you guys and and it's not that complex  if they explain it but no one's explaining hey there's a little blow up at the ocean floor  right like no nobody said it so i i'm guessing it's more complicated i don't know if it's you  know a mile into the rocky it's got to be more than just the little hole at the bottom of the ocean  that they can just oh yeah i think we all understand that but you're saying that it could be as far as  two miles down at that point is just amazing to me probably uh agree with that two miles more 
[01:11:30]  yeah yeah oil just sitting there like right below this the water wow on no i know that but  ground wow wow it's a lot of pipe and that's they lay in pipe motherfucker and that's dinosaurs  yeah it's just squished up organic material dinosaurs plankton seaweed all that good stuff  just sitting there holy under a lot of pressure our time on this earth means nothing a lot of time 
[01:12:00]  holy shit it just means nothing the this is a blink of a blink of an eye is even too long  our lives are just everyone blink out there see that i can't just said that's probably a thousand  years oh yeah yeah that's a long fucking time do a blink that's a thousand years thousand years  right there you just somewhere in that dumb blink is your tiny little life oh just why bother all just  relative to you by the way right like oh here's my life no it's just to you right why bother 
[01:12:30]  everything else is uh moving at a pretty slow pace at least after we go we'll have some tapes for a  while but those will disintegrate eventually too we'll be on the internet for a while until  something new enough time goes by and then we'll be like every show ever taped on vhs tapes  just gone why are we paying our mortgages it doesn't matter why bother it doesn't matter it's  talk like this that makes people homeless right and just walking around talking to themselves on the  streets you know what they probably have a much better life yeah no stress no worry 
[01:13:00]  all right all right blanking out all right yo don't have to worry about your health you just  fucking do drugs fucking smoke drink that fucking crack whores god i was watching uh intervention last  night oh yeah oh my god there was one chick she was pretty hot um and i even twittered is it is it  really that wrong to watch that show and just think how easy it would be to fuck that girl no no not at  all because all you'd need she's like yelling at her mother and her grandmother to give her uh 
[01:13:30]  60 bucks and uh for obviously for drugs and they wouldn't give it to her you're like like just hang  out with this chicken and and if you just have some money for some dope it's so it's called it's  called whore bait yeah yeah yeah yeah you'd be her rock bottom crack whore  it's time i get help yeah they're like the gazelles with like a fucking sprained ankle  yeah yeah you know what i mean they're absolutely going for the kill 
[01:14:00]  mm-hmm uh guy working in the oil uh drilling industry here at let's say hi to ray ray in texas  hey how's it going fellas you you wear one of those big fucking texas fucking what a  fucking big uh 10 gallon hat yeah i don't want to call it a cowboy hat because that's almost cool  i'm talking about that other hat you guys wear the one like hawks wore it's always funny to see  some of you guys walking around time square with those big 10 gallon hats and boots and belt  buckles just saying rob me a little out of place sir hey i got me a yankees ball cap on right now so 
[01:14:30]  don't don't fuck me too much you're a yankee fan in texas i hear you do you get a lot of shit down  there nah man oh man all right ray what do you got about this bp thing uh uh i'm actually hauling  some equipment down there to port fuchon which is where they uh uh do a lot of the shore base operations  for uh the oil rigs out there and um they do have pipes that can go down that far i'm hauling two of 
[01:15:00]  them right now uh the the plan is they're going to try to get uh some uh actual they have these  robots that'll go down there uh do the welding that they'll talk about and then uh they're going to put  the uh put the pipes back together they'll get the oil out of there that's how they get the uh oil  uh up to the platform which is with these big pipes problem with bp right now is they are 
[01:15:30]  micromanaging uh the recovery operation they basically got too many chiefs not enough indians  and most of these guys know college educated people uh he's talking they're not very technical  the corporate world yeah yeah too many fucking meetings and and boardrooms without actually doing  anything yeah literally boardrooms that's right because it's boring that's exactly what's going  on down there right now boys i can tell you that firsthand so uh that's all i got to say i better 
[01:16:00]  be quiet uh scott in virginia scott hey opie you were talking about how insignificant we are just up  the street from you there at the natural history museum they have to uh walk along the geological  timeline and it goes from the big bang all the way to present and when you get right down to the end  they have a strand of human hair that covers the entire existence of humans on the planet yeah and  how long is the entire line uh i don't know it's from the big bang till president no but i mean how 
[01:16:30]  long how long in the museum right how long is it if it's only if it's only one inch then it's not that  impressive if it's a mile long then it's very impressive how long is the human one's length the  width of a human hair yeah uh it's from the planetarium all the way to the exit so it's a  stop a couple of hundred yards oh wow and humans is one lousy hair like a little hair  just nothingness and that's from like dumb chrome magnum man and we're not even going to make two 
[01:17:00]  human hairs you know that right no we're not going to make two human no this earth will be  fucking happy when we're gone so they can get everything back together we'll just be shaking  off like any other thing that's been here dinosaurs were around for so much longer than we're ever going  to be around so dinosaurs were here for a good eight to ten thousand years and they and something  happened to them i think it was longer chip it's like you know millions upon millions of years  dinosaurs were here oh let's go to paul in newberg paul yeah hey paul huh it's very easy 
[01:17:30]  i want uncle yeah yeah you're talking about uh the rose center you ever been down there the uh  down the old uh aiden planetarium they have a walk around a spiral and it talks about the time frame  the beginning of the uh universe and stuff like the galaxy and now all the formation of it and you keep  walking around and how the planets are forming and each few feeders how many millions of years and you get 
[01:18:00]  to the very very end of it you listen to this headphone set and at the very end it goes now  stop you're at the end of the thing and you spiral down like three levels and he goes now here comes  human existence and he goes well we actually contributed created society religion our language  and the art and stuff and he goes there's a thickness of about of a dime and it was like you walked  around i mean how many cases all the way down he goes this is when we actually came on earth  and make any type of sickness at all that's wonderful  for nothing and also you see the intervention on south park people are talking about i haven't 
[01:18:30]  seen the episode yet they did a whole uh spoof on intervention yeah with howling now he's all uh  hooked on cracking doing uh giving blow jobs some cash and it's the same episode where uh jimmy and  timmy are uh working at uh they're at a camp instead of party caca party caca and he's he's  off he's supposed to be uh giving everybody a dry job but instead he's out in the woods  yeah i i can't i cannot watch uh intervention now i watched two oh i can watch it i watched two 
[01:19:00]  episodes but without thinking of what we were talking about what jimmy elaborated the me me me  thing is just running rampant there's a a guy who's in his 20s uh hooked on heroin uh they got the mother  and the father which are just enabling asses and uh it seems the brother and sister of this guy 
[01:19:30]  died from heroin overdoses and he was the one that showed them how to shoot up and everything  so this kid's all fucked up and the father is just enabling just giving him a place to live  giving him money for drugs and everything and he was so fucked up so they do the intervention he's like  i'm not going i'm not going to rehab i don't have a problem i didn't and uh he finally decided  because they said well if you don't go then we're cutting you off completely he went he left after  like eight days of course and then his father took him back in why he left after eight days because he 
[01:20:00]  knew they he had that support system it's a support system for uh to do more drugs or or drink and these  families are all their whole lives are dedicated to catering to the misery you don't have one that  they have to fucking do i'm amazed that you don't have one of these in your family and i'm not saying  i'm saying your extended family whatever i think a majority of the people listening to us have one  fucking person that's in their family whether it's really close or an extended family that affects 
[01:20:30]  everything yeah it was tyler was his name that was the episode and the whole family uh uh revolves  around this the whole thing ruining a lot of shit and the one before it was britney and she was kind  of hot right and uh is that the one you want to bang uh it was one like if i i said she probably would  be easy uh but but she goes to like crack houses and like she was gang raped at 15 when she was doing 
[01:21:00]  drugs and so that makes the family feel sorry for her so and they kind of help her out and she had  get this though before she was born yeah the mother uh they had other children and they had this daughter  that was about 12 i guess and the daughter was abducted from the house when the babysitter was over  and uh raped and murdered so now the mother has this guilt complex like she wasn't home for her child  so they have this new kid britney and she's treating her like the the dead kid right so it 
[01:21:30]  fucks her mind all up it's just all just this whole fucking stew of dysfunctionality it's unbelievable  yeah the me me me thing and the me and it was they were all just catering to her and please you can't  go don't go to the crack house and she goes because she knows they're going to be waiting for  they'll be right there they'll be right there for her helping her out enabling her we got patrice  o'neal in studio we gotta take a break just because we have like 18 fucking live reads for for mother's 
[01:22:00]  day stuff that's very important stuff i didn't say it was bad but we do have to get to a lot of those  live reads so yeah uh patrice joins the program next so we'll stay there opie and anthony  opie and anthony mornings 6 to 11 a.m  opie and anthony we got a very busy show today first uh let's go with jimmy jimmy's got uh uh  uh uh brigada yeah brigada dates right yeah i have to hit this because they're putting it on sale early 
[01:22:30]  for me it's this friday the date is uh july 2nd and 3rd it's a big weekend down there it goes on sale  this friday 10 a.m uh www the brigada.com you know where to go for tickets but they sold out  in january so i'm only doing two this summer very very cool okay we got patrice o'neal in  studio for the rest of the show and uh before we get into what patrice is doing obviously jump in  uh immediately patrice but we're talking about the times square suspect and we laid out exactly how  it went down they they've been following the guy since yesterday right it followed the guy yesterday 
[01:23:00]  pretty much knew who he was and they didn't arrest him right away which was very smart police work  and detective work they wanted to see if anyone else was involved so they followed the guy for  pretty much a day seeing if he was going to do some banking seeing who he was talking to uh  up there in bridgeport connecticut uh i'm sure they were seeing who he was calling if he was calling  anybody then uh they also knew that he was getting ready to to split on a plane back to dubai so they 
[01:23:30]  knew that and they followed him to the airport they followed him through security they had people  in place at the airport uh then in in the area outside the gate they they were watching if he was  meeting anyone before he got on the plane they had it fucking they had it all figured out yeah they  weren't letting this guy get away they know who he was and then he got on the plane they were even  waiting uh uh at that point to see if anyone else on the plane with him and then they finally uh  uh you know arrested the guy okay that's exactly how it went down exactly but the stupid fucking 
[01:24:00]  media and the stupid local news they want to make more of it they want to make it sound like a a  movie right they want some spy angle and some mystique so we got some examples of the media just  trying to make it more than what it really is three examples we start with tampa bay from fox 13 the  most powerful name in local news this is good day tampa bay almost got away the suspect in the failed 
[01:24:30]  times square bombing arrested almost got away almost got away how we just laid it out for you did he  almost get away no no not at all and then you get uh cnn doing this this morning whether or not they  actually intentionally let him get as far as he did or whether or not he was uh not on a flight  manifest and that he was caught in the nick of time as that plane was actually pulling away from 
[01:25:00]  the jet jetway no there was not a whether or not situation here they told cnn no this is what happened  and cnn has to go well whether or not god and then finally uh nbc and it looks like this arrest happened  literally in the nick of time there's a report this morning that says the suspect had already  boarded the plane and the plane had backed away from the gate that they had to bring it back to  get him off they know the news sucks so bad they explained exactly what they were doing knowing the 
[01:25:30]  news is going to do this and the news still does it we wanted to make sure there was no one else  involved they came out and said that is the guy meeting people at the airport is he is he boarding the  the flight with other people that might have been and then once he's just sitting on the plane is he  is he looking around at people and right you know making any contacts on the plane they know another  example why the fucking news just sucks a nick of time almost got away 
[01:26:00]  god damn it does oprah have a nice set of tits what look she's walking i can't see the  fucking i can't see the the station identifying thing is blocking half the screen yeah say what  you want about oprah but she's got a nice fucking set man she had a low-cut fucking dress with some  nice cleavings what are you trying to do a good job over there yeah like that's gonna help  yeah talking about oprah's tits yeah that's gonna get me into harpo you're right you're right 
[01:26:30]  never one lift the tits of a fat woman and lick underneath them no unless it's really cold out  never in summer weather you think there's some kind of odor coming from that it's always sweaty  it smells like lamb under a fat girl's tits  wait till you see that video that you just showed though ant you might  nah you're not gonna change your fucking what am i thinking that jimmy might though jimmy might go  you know no i don't you might give me a you know  no i'm pretty i'm i pretty much know where i stand with oprah sexually really yeah i like her as a 
[01:27:00]  talk show host but does nothing for my dick all right how are you patrice i'm good man what do you  think of this whole time square suspect thing some phony shit to just get fucking fat bitches all  around time square checking you before you go into is that it mcdonald's take your shoes off or you  gonna feel like the the airport just walking around time square take a bite of your sandwich  before you leave to make sure there's no yeah fuck out of here you want to go i don't believe  it at all no failed anything has anybody done timothy mcveigh is a he blew up the world in a truck 
[01:27:30]  this guy fucking has a a steamy it was a fucking flat iron in there with some clothes so now they're  gonna shut down time square and fucking have a bunch of motherfuckers you know what deciding to  fucking you know what you want violate your life fuck that shit you watch this is the last straw and  it's gonna drive jimmy nuts but now you watch time square is just people now no cars shut down we  can't take the chance no and people are willing to have it happen people need to do the safety 
[01:28:00]  really a fail but what how many failed bombs has there ever been that you wanted it to be what did  this guy put this shit together like real quick just willy-nilly i don't believe it he just slapped  it together well he's pakistani he was in pakistan for five months yeah you're surprised of course he's  pakistan i guess the smart thing if they was doing this shit is just make them chinese so  something new something really has it been pakistan oh really the fuck out of here yesterday 
[01:28:30]  we were thinking flying back to the emirates like for real yesterday we were thinking uh middle-aged  white guy for just a little bit a few hours we thought middle-aged white guy they're getting  fucking super lazy and they are i don't believe it i mean if it blew up i like you believe it  because but i if it blew up i still wouldn't believe that is what it was but there's got to  be dummy terrorists too like there's a lot of them this guy's a dummy terrorist he don't believe  it i didn't believe in i jimmy i just i'm not believing it man yeah his penis was on fire a lot 
[01:29:00]  of people saw it yeah you don't believe i'm just not believing what do you think they are then i'm  thinking it's you know me you know me you think it's just some kind of illuminati plan these things  to make it look like they're i think that war yeah we're moving out of war uh-huh and we're moving  into something else we're moving into a world where they're trying to get you to be it's a global uh 
[01:29:30]  uh fucking ruler global ruling the banks and everything else and i just think they're moving  a little bit out of war because war is not the patriotic thing war used to be necessary when we  was yeah cold and everything but now it's like everything's becoming global and they just i think  they're just doing things to make it global so they could just start implementing their so how does  this do it how does i mean it's like arizona man it's just well it's easy you just you know a couple 
[01:30:00]  of fucking mexicans you know raping murder a bitch in arizona and lets people you know whatever  they call it those fucking chapter 206 and rule 72 and fucking this and and let police it's the fact  that they're letting police now our judge dreads man like just yeah they could just be the law and  they could just tell you what the fuck to do and and then this douche a smoky they're ready with their  bomb unit in the smoky car that doesn't explode and bloomberg who's a part of these motherfuckers 
[01:30:30]  seven billion dollar motherfucker with his own network and he's down with this shit and he just  goes up they up and now they're gonna shut time square now big fat bitch from newark he's gonna be  telling me give me id to walk down each block yeah yeah like it's like fuck you i don't you know i don't  give a fuck man it's it's it's a kind of a thing for a power grab i hate this i can't i hope these  fucking the ancient delivery boys from mexico are right in 2012 i'm gonna be sitting on my roof 
[01:31:00]  hoping that a giant fucking earthquake i just hope so michu kaku already said that's all  bullshit the 2012 thing i hope it's not i just hope something happens because it's just ridiculous  but you're right about time square there's gonna they're gonna they're gonna get rid of cars now  officially they have to they already they were working on it already yeah but but now this makes  it very easy for bloomberg uh to go look we get no cars we can't have fucking cars driving through 
[01:31:30]  this area that has a lot of people the parking garage people are behind it that's who it is  everybody will need parking garages but it's already the plan is already great you take a turn  you go through seventh ave maybe they're trying to just completely shut down seventh avenue yeah  and uh and but listen here's another one i read another one they're trying to stop transportation  period like you see there's supposed to be no money right but it's constant 80 story buildings being 
[01:32:00]  built on the waters and there's trains and shit on the water they're trying to slowly control travel  like control your movement and they build these shitty buildings stacked on top of each other 500  people in the building and you can't go nowhere unless you're controlled by cars are very independent  they'll just stop trains they'll stop cars where you need permission to drive like it sounds crazy  but it's if they do it you'll be like oh shit they did it it's it but it's easy to do they're 
[01:32:30]  gonna stop look at time square they're gonna shut that down can't drive bunch of happy people feeling  safe on the red stairs and the stupid whatever they're gonna build over you know the the disney  the disney store they're building to take the place of virgin and all that shit and have people just  happy gotta go and get on a train where you have to go where they won't let you drive raising the  fucking to toll for the holland tunnel from from four dollars to eight to twelve to fifty they're gonna 
[01:33:00]  price you out you can't you have to ride the fucking path train or some shit and then you're  in control of where you go and where you are yes they control you that's what they're building these  stupid buildings who the can afford to live in these buildings who is who's moving in these places  your theory has some holes there it's not my theory it's just something i believe it's really expensive to  have a car in manhattan it just is so really expensive and they actually lost on the price 
[01:33:30]  plan they tried to do they tried to price people out of coming into new york from the east side yeah  and they did lose that i mean they were voting to park in one of these but the voting is just that's  some more to park in manhattan cost you a lot of money man yeah but that's who's gonna be able to do  dollars basically wherever you go i drive a truck i can afford like it costs it costs me 40 to just  come in and have fun yeah trees exactly i can afford that but riffraff exactly trees is talking  about like the the masses the masses you're gonna have the upper elite that's gonna be able to drive 
[01:34:00]  around and shit and that'll be hard to you know keep them from coming in but the majority of people  will be under some kind of control this this when and where they go this eminent domain thing man with  it where the government can just go you know i want i want your shit that's yeah we're taking that  i don't even know how i own my house i got paperwork but if a motherfucker said this is mine  i'd be like i'll be looking for some jew to help me keep my house but don't forget one guy that guy  with eminent domain where they were trying to knock it down to build the nets stadium in brooklyn one guy 
[01:34:30]  held that process up in court for seven years seven years seven years and he held out and he got  everybody else got like a million but they tried to lowball him and he fucked him in court he got three  million and something for property that was worth nowhere near that so it's like one guy in court  that's how you because they they still have to go through those things in terms of it's it's like  the reason like they take whatever taxes they take it's like is that an arbitrary number that they 
[01:35:00]  figured out this is the tax it's just because they can't take it all because they don't like they  they just don't yet i just can't take it i just this guy this blow-up guy i just it's  vince from bion writes it's not this is your quote by the way patrice it's not my theory it's  just something i believe and then he writes what the hell does that ever even mean yeah it's just  like i didn't look it's just a feeling you have here's here's all of us all of us are parrots of  some shit somebody else there's thoughts out there that that enable us to think on top of that thought 
[01:35:30]  right but there is a there's motherfuckers who work hard on conspiracy theories and and you put them  together you go you either go this is stupid or you go makes a lot of sense and i believe it  because you know i just believe in that that kind of shit so i'm saying i didn't make it up but i just  i believe in it and i'm thinking on top of it but but that's all now the thing is and this is always  what blows apart any conspiracy theory with me who's behind it banks but banks so so they all get 
[01:36:00]  together yes and have these meetings and plan the build a bird group the fucking and they plan  yes the the the um foreign affairs the the committee for foreign affairs it's it's these guys they  exist they fucking exist the other one oh fucking people who just want to run the earth there's too  many people they want us to take fucking drugs and fucking vaccines that don't work they just this 
[01:36:30]  fucking people who are doing that patrice is talking like the guy that get in the movie your  brakes would give out on your way home now yeah that's what happened in the movie patrice's brakes  give out what happened i i like what that's saying if if all this is true what you're saying you're  gonna have a rough ride no it's too many there's too many motherfuckers that's gonna have a rough  because right now your boy on fox is spitting that shit just because there's a black president now he's  spitting new world order shit because obama's in office but it's all the real shit because i think 
[01:37:00]  racism trumps fucking conspiracy theories uh what's his name there um glenn beck glenn beck is losing  his mind glenn beck with this with the whole world because of obama but that shit is he's standing in  the tea party they they they having him be racist and a lot of them is on a racist platform but the  platform is fucking government and government in your life and all that shit that they should have  been spitting when when this fucking crazy crack was in there before that tea party thing is no more 
[01:37:30]  racist than any other than anything else but they're busting out like it's racist organization and it's  it's mostly racist anti-white fucking rhetoric i mean as it should i mean you got that senator  fucking exactly he apologized he was on page 18 of the daily news today the words shit that  motherfucker what you're saying is racism we're gonna have you remove have me remove you want to  step outside this motherfucker is acting like a thug why is that me niggas gotta sound like that but 
[01:38:00]  he did in this case he did patrice in this case he did anthony's right on this one i can't go  it kevin parker anthony doesn't do bad impressions so he probably just sounds just like this he was  very angry he's so angry i don't care what color he is he's just an angry motherfucker okay he should  not be in office i don't have a retort it's all it's just on but between the people who run government  are not this is the thing they're not a higher species than us they're the same dummies that we 
[01:38:30]  like they're the same guys that like walk into the bathroom after somebody else stinks it up  that's that's that's true that's true jim and that's the thing it's like they're not that smart  it's the it's the basis that i think that every idea has has some validity to it like most ideas  there's some ideas that you go that's just a bad idea but the idea of the police is a great idea  the idea that somebody's there to help you when you're in trouble and this is the idea of taxes to  help you build shit the idea of all this shit is great but when people get the idea of government 
[01:39:00]  it's fantastic that's there's some people that's smarter but it's the people that fuck up the idea  every idea is great but when you get a cop that's just overly indulgent in power it becomes a bad  fucking idea i'm just saying that the people in government once they're smart enough to use these  things against us which they don't give you just said it you said it ob you said people just don't 
[01:39:30]  take care of themselves man there's fucking guys that are in in uh the or bp who's just trying to  figure out how to switch blame instead of going man people are gonna die fish are gonna die we're  gonna die because we're not gonna fish are gonna be are gonna cost twenty dollars a fucking people  we're gonna be able to fucking eat and just be human about it but they're gonna be shitty about  it who the fuck is gonna order a fish fry next week but that's what i'm crazy enough to order  a fish next right now you're done that's when we get our fish right now you figure the fish is still 
[01:40:00]  okay but next week two weeks from now i ain't fucking ordering fish anytime shrimp is when you  get fried anyway fuck it get a lot of shrimp how about some sushi are you gonna order some sushi  that's what this is i might weeks from now three weeks from now my mother can't she  fucking i'm taking a break boston can't even fucking take a shot my mother called you know  she texts me in boston up in boston and the water is not the water main broke the water is not dirty  there's just some horrible bacteria in it that they told them about or whatever but my mother had 
[01:40:30]  gotten sick weeks before because the water looks good but it's she's drinking some horrible  that invisible bacteria and now they told them and but you gotta you gotta hope that somebody is  telling you the fucking truth and by the way the water was shut off for what a day two days yes and  all hell was starting to break loose as people were trying to get water from the supermarket at my  mother could you imagine if 60 years old my mother can't two days with no shot go to work stink a 60 
[01:41:00]  old lady stinks at work it's like for real can't have water we're three days away from chaos i believe  it where was that like i so believe it for any die hard four it was something like that now it's like  with any situation if you run out of food water if if the machine breaks down and there's there's not  the services you're used to and i don't mean minor little things like a severe breakdown of food water  things like that electricity electricity you're three days away from complete anarchy and chaos but people 
[01:41:30]  will lose their fucking minds on an unprecedented level that's why the crazy uh what's her name  napolitanio napolit the the boss of the the leader of the uh homeland security they're switching uh the  focus from arabs yeah to uh the crazy guys in the hills and the those guys got it correct they're not  going to when this starts fucking up those dudes got it right it's it's the fact that it's that racial 
[01:42:00]  angle that they always have to push those got it right they build their own homes they got their own  water they got their own supply they do what did in the back in the day even though when that's not  comfortable but those guys got it right we we got it wrong because they'll be the ones they control your  shit knowing how to survive and two million people are under the control of the bacteria that they 
[01:42:30]  say isn't that's in the water or whatever they in we're just in control we're being controlled by  that's what i'm saying why but we're not we're not ants we're not ants being controlled by a person  we're all you understand we're all on pretty much the same level and like 2 000 years ago we were throwing  our own shit at each other and now we have elevators and planes but 2 000 years ago there was we're not  headed towards this domination by a small group yes i don't believe that that's called that's  that's called feudalism it's because back in the day there was one dude running shit and you go holy 
[01:43:00]  shit i can't do this it deep right outside my door is a million angry motherfuckers so what i gotta do is  create about a hundred thousand greedy motherfuckers who who are better then you take a hundred thousand  out that million and they're better than 900 000 people and give them shit and they will stop to  say look you get the clean back the non-bacterial water all you got to do is step on the neck push a 
[01:43:30]  couple of buttons tell these 900 000 people that are slaves to money now we're we're debt slaves and then  there's a hundred thousand people who are to haves and they'll put their fucking william shatner with  his 600 million you think he wouldn't kill your family all my to keep his to keep one dollar of  his price line money he'll put his fucking foot on the neck it's just people are fucked up i like how 
[01:44:00]  you're breaking it down but communism would have worked and if that was the truth people  fucked up communism i'm saying communism would have won if that was the case it's much easier to control  people if everyone's getting paid the same everyone serves the government communism would  communism fucked up because the people at the top didn't do the right thing they got more they were  greedy and got greedy right okay so it's the same people who run in communism are the same dummies who  are supposedly going to run the world banks like they're the same they make these dumb decisions they 
[01:44:30]  make mistakes they get they go that's why they haven't done the big move yet because it's just not  enough of them to stop a a a panic of five million people like soon as they figure out how to  fucking kill a few and control a few that's why they're they're shutting down these eminent domain  and getting all this land and then moving you and me or whatever to the side of the ocean where the 
[01:45:00]  trains are so we can get on those trains and go where the fuck they're going to take it it just  it happened in germany like what the fuck do you think this shit is can't happen you're not allowed  to talk to bill burr ever again now bill's into this shit but you know it's just it's just the internet  because me and bill don't really correspond about it it's just there a lot of people believe it it's  just there dude well then they're gonna have to shut down the internet so we don't get uh together  you don't think they're doing that shit china china is the blueprint figured it out for the 
[01:45:30]  world people love the world leaders love china but why would the internet have gotten this far  it's like it's impossible to really or very difficult why would it have gotten this far  like in last 15 years for a group that's going to control us and control our thoughts they have  allowed something that is basically uncontrollable to explode all over the planet because they didn't  they didn't they didn't realize it at first and it's it's the same thing with the with the news  the reason they have to control it now is because again the the the constitution is being broken down 
[01:46:00]  and and the freedom of of press which is to protect us against what you the dumb the the news that they're  giving us like is this somebody just sitting there listening to these they just found them and they're  like wow they just and and you're a thinker and everybody in this room is really a thinker like  these stupid motherfuckers the internet became something that um was supposed to to dummy us  down which it does because now our head is down with our heads never up anymore ever we just down 
[01:46:30]  looking at this and that and really once we trust in that information they start manipulating it and  our head's still down trusting that shit look at wikipedia that shit people are flunking out of  college behind that shit anybody could just say you ain't somebody could just invent you so if  you trust the info you can control the info yes if you know the people trust the info then you can  control that that's right once once we kind of like kind of like that thought you know i mean 
[01:47:00]  it's just like it a little bit look it sounds like crazy rantings but people i can't believe  people just don't have maybe 45 of disbelief they believe they believe i believe in the idea of  the police i love the idea of 9-1-1 my cat's in a tree i love that fucking shit but the idea it's  people so what kind of timeline do you think before the majority of people start going oh  fuck we got ourselves in some shit i don't know i don't know i mean like there's got to be a turning 
[01:47:30]  point where the majority of people in the country or in the world even if this is a whole world thing  turn and goes wait a minute this isn't like it was we're kind of really they don't feel they don't  look it here's here's what kills me about people and one thing is that we're so willing to move on  from something that you go wait a minute let's can we figure this out before i move on to the next thing 
[01:48:00]  is the fact that there's no the one it kills me that there's no basis for our wealth in this  country meaning our the money's made up from debt debt is now wealth in this country so all we're  doing is spend we are slaves the government slaves to the bank and we're slaves to the government but  we just say okay like even that fuck all the other spaceship shit and 9 11 the real fact is 
[01:48:30]  you don't own your money how many times do you pay seven dollars with a credit card we don't even carry  cash cash is useless so our money is digitized man we got digital money and you don't think they could  they just go hey man you know uh mr kumia uh we need an extra two million we we saw something in our  in our books what thank you you can't hide it because it's on your card are they doing that  by closing down some of these banks yes it's a one because that's wiping out that's wiping out 
[01:49:00]  people's accounts just like that because it's just they're only like that they're only insured up to  what depending on the bank 250 250 000 so if you got a million dollars in the bank all of a sudden  you got a million you just lost 750 just where is that 750 paying off the bank but a lot of guys that  a year ago would have been called power brokers lost all their money too like two years ago a lot  of these guys the head of of uh say wachovia or all these banks would have been considered part of  that conspiracy yeah but they're not they're not they're not the creators of the see people think 
[01:49:30]  they got a little cash if i had look give me five million i'm on i'm gonna dig a hole and hide it  somehow i'm gonna buy jewels or something because i know in this system if they'll fuck a white boy  they'll fuck me i it's like donnie brosco i can only be a friend of yours i can't be a friend of  ours i i can't so it's like these guys do you think a billion dollars they're not rockefeller 
[01:50:00]  and and and and fucking jp more the guys who created this system who said fuck the the constitution  nigga we gonna run the world and that should happen in 1913 with the fucking uh the meeting that  that that they uh you you see this thing why we fight there was a i keep you know it's not  oh the documentary the documentary that was great when this guy was apologizing um  was it truman that was apologizing he apologized for getting us into this he said i'm so sorry 
[01:50:30]  that the industrial uh banking system in the fight i'm sorry i fucked us up i'm sorry we're  fucked i sold it off we we this country went bankrupt in 1931 man it went back we we are we're just  cattle man we ain't shit so we'll never really notice because we just kind of get used to things  and go on a treadmill as long as the as long as you turn the faucet and the water comes out and 
[01:51:00]  what do you care you got a pool switch and the light and a fucking house man what do you care you  don't you right it's just as long as as long as i have it tomorrow and the next day so what it's  supposed to be better for anthony is that what you're saying it's better for aunt so is it supposed  to be better for anthony some of us have to be comfortable you you that's that's the thing about  revolt man and when people revolted everybody was fucked yeah and then and then it was like  close to being late all right i'm just trying to like break down a little bit so if you keep enough 
[01:51:30]  just enough people happy like an anthony and myself whatever jimmy probably would be enough people with  the idea of happiness so then it it makes it uh easier not to have a revolution on you because  what are poor people attaining to be they're attaining to be you right a poor person is attaining to be  me and then i'm attaining to be you and you might be attaining to be bill gates it's all so you keep  enough people happy and then uh other people feeling like they could attain what anthony has 
[01:52:00]  until everybody sounds like a homeless person so that's why talking about bread in your stomach  there ain't no bread soaks up so that's why in the end so that's why in the end is a revolution  isn't possible in the year 2010 in this country probably not too much information too much back in  the 1700s a lot easier you read about a company monsanto they are dismembering dismantling mexico  mexico used to have be self-sufficient with their food monsanto came in and they have genetically 
[01:52:30]  modified food that only grows with the chemicals that they have and and they spray it on the  fucking corn that the mexicans used to to be independent kill that now they have their  fucking science corn that they need to grow with their science shit and it's just  fucking killing us uh it was woodrow wilson that apologized woodrow wilson thank you he's  apologized for fucking us all right i didn't see that documentary i was thinking that's a great i 
[01:53:00]  was thinking of the one that and saw and i saw as well fog of war oh fog of war last time i was  here you guys showed the fucking bomb thing which was yeah it was shocking to me fog of war was great  because the guy was just stuck in horrible washington traffic and this guy was the secretary of defense  yeah um like nixon yeah and that guy was responsible for a lot of shit and he's just  just one of us stuck in fucking horrible he's in traffic like horrible commuter traffic in the rain  now right but when did all this fighting because it's like it's not like we were nice and then all 
[01:53:30]  of a sudden got shitty after jp morgan the american indians were lopping each other's heads off  it's it's basically just human nature we've always been fighting so if they say why we fight and  they somehow come back to the rich trying to well no it's not like we were fighting we were separate  too i i agree with you and that's what that's the use of it it says like if you find the the one i  don't know if it's or if it's just opportunists if me and you have a nature to fight and somebody  else goes holy shit it's like boxing don king make all the money why these other motherfuckers blast 
[01:54:00]  their heads open so if you got a well if we are animals and we like fighting anyway it's like  shit i don't like the fight let's figure out how to get all these motherfuckers who like doing  stupid shit to do stupid shit and i like if you if you can benefit from a guy who's willing to blow  himself up for some cause that's some horse shit yeah why wouldn't you make a couple of zillion  dollars if he was a piece of shit instead of stopping him from doing that let me i don't believe  that one baboon can run the other baboons life as effectively as as but a group of a group of baboons 
[01:54:30]  might be able to look man have a little more and they're not that much smarter hitler killed  six million fucking people man but he didn't do it he got he convinced other motherfuckers to do  it and as he was charismatic enough to go these people ain't shit let's kill them like roaches it  people are fucking idiots so he's a baboon but he this dumber baboons there's all there's a leader 
[01:55:00]  baboon i want to ask anthony something because i i really don't know the answer to this did hitler  how many people did hitler actually kill i don't know in world war one uh he probably killed a few  people right uh he called other people during the war to kill obviously but yeah later on he when he  became the fuhrer he didn't kill people he didn't kill anybody he had people killed and who do you  blame do you blame he had people killed this is what i'm saying do you blame him that's why i don't 
[01:55:30]  like people who just go okay it's my job do you blame hitler or do you blame the fucking guys who  was just fucking killing people i don't who do you blame if i'm like hey i hate chinese i want them all  dead and somebody goes you know you're right patrice let's kill him and is it me because i'm just  fucking i got the the ability to fucking coerce but then you go back i don't even know if manson's  fucking guilty with these other idiots that did his fucking bidding then you could argue you need the  ideal situation because it was you know the surrender of world war one and uh germany was 
[01:56:00]  putting a pretty bad position with the treaty of versailles so that's what made world war ii  possible and what made nazi germany possible because the people were so disillusioned with  their position and their lack of power and the german people do not like being told they cannot build  fucking cool yeah no one was happy right it was it was you know so so that made it easier so  you know as far as a conspiracy thing goes no i can't see that but you can't just have some guys  show up where people are generally happy and go hey start killing motherfuckers they're gonna be 
[01:56:30]  like hey that's crazy you know you need some you need the proper mix of misery and scapegoats and  you know shit like that to make the perfect mix where one guy can then say hey motherfuckers  let's start killing people and even though that baboon was smarter than the other ones that baboon shot  himself in a bunker because he'd be up it's like they're not that much ahead of us there's someone  more charismatic but none of them is smart enough to pull it all off and make it worse 
[01:57:00]  we're getting a little close exactly even that baboon knew that yeah it's like i don't want these  guys taking me you got everyone reacting we gotta take a couple of these uh rich long island patrice  o'neill in studio today what's up rich attack of conspiracy negro  uh  that fuck i've been waiting all the time to do that  that's got to be the first call uh jeff in canada jeff yeah hey this is uh for patrice uh one of the 
[01:57:30]  ross trials was quoted as saying we make more money in one day of war than we do in a whole year of  peace yeah words good business yeah it's great business man candy too yeah roth child you ever  have one of those it's so creamy i think a lot of people have enough of the roth childs by the way  i'm tired of hearing about you yes can i please say this look if you get a guy that's just immersed in 
[01:58:00]  this on one side or the other i'm talking about a little bit of information that i i try to put my own  mind to not just spit out what's my i'm not saying they're gonna make me look like an  asshole if they have enough shit to punch me in the head with but i'm not sitting here going wow  patrice you sound crazy because it is a little bit of this little that and i'm usually the one that says  anything conspiracy i'm jumping on and saying bullshit bullshit bullshit but there's something  going on i can't quite put my finger on there's something going on that's why they're financially you're 
[01:58:30]  right that's but i don't know if it's just the evolution of where we were going anyway if it's  some group of people that are orchestrating this or if it's just you know like i said some kind of  evolution like like people change uh well if you think people are getting smaller because of  the information age now that's something that came about because of just evolution of our our natural  uh curiosity uh of of places like when people just set out in ships to see what the 
[01:59:00]  fuck was over there electronically we're doing that now so the world's a smaller place which  means we trade with people but electronically there's somebody that is behind every piece of  industry somebody said it was i think it was the guy this guy aaron russo who's who was a movie  producer and then he started going into into this uh the globalization world and he said something  about democracy he said he said off the forefathers didn't want democracy they wanted freedom 
[01:59:30]  democracy is not freedom you're right it's it is slave it is 51 of the people control 49 49 of the  people are slaves it's it's two wolves and a sheep voting for what's for dinner that's what democracy is  so so we are under the control of something when you think democratic it's not freedom we've talked  about it so many times that you're not free to do anything you're really not it's a fake freedom 
[02:00:00]  it's a fake for you because go out there try to shoot your own dinner tonight yeah yeah go out on  the streets go and just go i'm hunting squirrels and you just like go to central park with a rifle  you will not be free very long but that was legal until people started getting shot by people who  don't know how to aim at a squirrel and we all said we don't we don't want that freedom of true  freedom but we said we don't want that to be legal anymore we said that as a people we don't 
[02:00:30]  want it to be legal i don't know that's the people that represent the point is now we go back to the  times square guy yeah that guy is the guy who shot you by mistake hunting squirrels now we all can't  fucking can't hunt squirrels and we're all willing to give up the right to not hunt squirrels i don't  know if we're willing we don't have a choice we do it's we don't have a you know what if we went  to the fucking airport and people that represent us said put take your shoes off you go there's an 
[02:01:00]  i have diabetes there's a nail on the floor i'm gonna step on it and die i'm not taking off my  fucking shoes if everybody said fuck that eat my balls i'm not taking over i'm not taking off my  fucking shoes what could that bitch do we control ourselves with our own fear that somebody's gonna  fucking have a box cutter and take over the plane but when we didn't take off our shoes until some  guy tried to blow the plane up with his shoes and now i'm happy to take my shoes off i don't care if 
[02:01:30]  they want to look at my feet because i'm worried about what's in his fucking shoes i don't mind  that's not giving up your freedom but that's the game that is giving up your freedom but i don't  think that's the game i don't want to take off my shoes i don't want to take off my shoes  i don't mind at all i don't i don't want to take my shoes off i don't but that's the game it's like  i'm not saying anything hold on hold on i want to go with jimmy for a second because jimmy's  really pissed off about come on man no no no about something else jimmy i know where i'm going with  this when they started closing down the streets in time square you were furious right yes because 
[02:02:00]  it was unnecessary i felt bloomberg didn't get it but now there's a very good possibility because  of this incident that they're going to shut down all traffic in time square right yes now do you mind  that it still annoys me it still annoys me because to me it's an overreaction and you can't  first of all you can't overreact you can't stop it going back to patrice's point we do seem to  overreact one guy does something next thing you know we all can't do it one of the few things i  learned in college from this ethics class it's it's the first thing ever he goes good is good if it's 
[02:02:30]  good for me that's what good is so if it doesn't bother me it's fine if it bothers me it's not so so  that's human nature human nature so they play in human nature they can't do this without our own  help they just can't do it it's not enough of them to to do it unless we go yes i'll do it and  that's it that's been the basis of a community for for ages but but true freedom like you're saying  is anarchy it's not true freedom it's the joker from batman exactly we had true freedom we had it 
[02:03:00]  and we don't it's not true freedom in the sense where everybody could just do whatever they want  okay fair enough we don't have that but that was voluntary because the species dictates that when we  have that we bash each other over we are evolving it's not necessarily becoming a global community and  i hate to sound like some flaming liberal saying this does not necessarily mean the rothschilds are going to  own everything i think we're evolving as a species and we're all going to have a certain level of 
[02:03:30]  communication a certain oneness and i hate to say it like that but the idea of country the idea of  country is even a primitive idea because you're separating your species by stupid unnecessary  boundaries but that's what that's what globalization is and i don't disagree with no freedom now think  about the baboon situation where you don't you don't mind taking your shoes off right look at when  you take your shoes off you're answering to a higher authority that's telling you you're you 
[02:04:00]  are letting those baboons control you thinking that that that they have the sense to handle the shoe  taking off that let me tell you how fucking stupid the tsa is they are uh they're reactive they're not  proactive exactly they just wait around for social wants to kill you to be smarter than them and then  they just say the thing they try to do is the new rule they that and and i let them control my 
[02:04:30]  shit no if they were proactive they'd be controlling your shit if to me if they're reactive it means  they're really not that bright they're not this amazing controlling entity but we all see something  happen and we go you know what that could be a major problem like for instance 9 11 happened only  because the cockpits they're trained to come out and negotiate had that not been the training of  those pilots 9 11 never would have happened if they would not have gotten in the doors had the  pilots not been trained to open the door or they just locked the door 9 11 wouldn't happen so it's 
[02:05:00]  like we learned now you can't get in the cockpit now so they have to try another way it's a chess  game it's a chess game that's all it is and it doesn't mean that there's some controlling  faction trying because taking the shoes off is not to me them trying to lull us to sleep i don't mind  doing it because i don't want to be sitting next to a guy who fucking lights his foot on fire  and i fucking plunge 30 000 i certainly don't want to x-ray looking at my little dick  see i don't mind that though but i don't mind that because you're swinging 
[02:05:30]  who's stupid enough to go to an airport with a fucking shoe bomb at this point right  and it's gonna be done in another way now that's pretty obvious i just it just to me i go right  i'm not saying there's no conspiracy i'm not even saying you're wrong let's summarize because we  gotta take a break i don't think that there's a controlling entity that is smart enough i really  don't think so they're not evolved any further than we are they're the same fucking dummies that we are 
[02:06:00]  and i don't think it's a grand plan i just think it's the way things are progressing because we've  come up with things like the internet it's made the world a lot smaller globalization has made um  made like your big world war ii things impossible now we're too dependent on each other  each other's countries to be at war with each other anymore we really are you can't now if you  don't have if you don't have patriotism as a as a motivation right you gotta move into this global 
[02:06:30]  thing there's gotta be a leader don't you feel don't you feel it's odd because well i do maybe  it's because i'm i'm a white person too in this country but i i feel like like i don't want to be  part of this globalization because i feel we're better than the rest of the world that's the game  we played that before now it's a new fucking game it worked well before because we were better and  we did much better but that was the that was the picture they laid they laid on us that's the thing  about us how long is this playing sports and we're world champs but we don't play nobody else that 
[02:07:00]  that's what the thing passed on generations are actually using this this grand plan that spans  generations and then all they do is fuck it up it's like it's like i think let's just take out  the the idea of a terrible global leader it's just just for devils out to get removed that yeah  we're all gonna be taller  what is when you look at and again i go with kind of kaku's theory about as a planet evolving yeah 
[02:07:30]  removing the evil entity that say is going to run it globalization us becoming kind of one  cornball say a community is not a bad thing it's not a bad thing because people live a lot longer  now we know a lot more now we're going to be able to colonize other it's not this horrible thing  where we're all going to be under the control of some monster but it's not in our nature as human  beings to like other people of other lands and and cultures it isn't i don't think i don't think 
[02:08:00]  we know that it's about that's what patriotism is about we are americans we're so much  fucking better than you but that's we don't like being thought of that well we'll just be part of  the fucking machine we want to be the fucking machine no no no we've always in china before  the internet though well let's be honest we've expanded at one point at one point we didn't like  the guy at the fucking cave down the fucking a mile down the road that was the problem now it's  people outside the borders of the country and then sooner or later it'll be a global thing it's like 
[02:08:30]  almost like the people we consider ours just keeps expanding it's just a slow process but it  started with fucking ten guys in a circle throwing rocks at anybody who walked over i thought there was  a cracker in the middle no that was the beginning of fun and true friendship  and one guy pretending that he didn't want to eat the cracker yeah okay man all jerking off in a  circle but we're just expanding that's all it is i mean you know if the idea where's my flame loin

[02:16:30]  psychologist and she said she started eating because mommy brought another baby home yeah they  decided to have another kid god forbid in that family and that's why wendy decided to  i was always the baby right right this is what she had a baby food was my attention you know let me  tell you some pasta is delicious by the pound until it comes out of my eyeballs and then when i go to  sleep it sits there dad came in and wobbled my balls that's why i like meatballs get out of here 
[02:17:00]  pork chops remind me of when i was robbed from my puma suit in the back of ymca shut the  fuck up it's just it tastes good this is what we need we need someone to come up and beat up our  psychologist i'm serious that would be funny wouldn't that be awesome you just go i was like  get out of my face you stupid oh man shit having harvey screaming at me harvey's just like come on  my heart chill out even though you know it'd be great i'm sure someone should just smack him we've had 
[02:17:30]  harvey huh i think harvey can actually beef though unless you can beef i won't fuck with him it's just  i like him a little bit more that he was messing with uh that fine ass kim uh what's his name yeah  man they broke up by her but wait who who was he with yeah kim lee lock kim lee lock one of the  american idol oh right right oh they started dating at celebrity fit club yeah oh yeah i didn't know  that big time do tell yeah that's great nice set of tits you're saying i'm saying that she 
[02:18:00]  where did they meet what did they do on their first day they both just relapsed on a sunday and  fucking vomited out the car window simultaneously i'm married so i can't you know i just what's  harvey's demon come on what's harvey what's harvey's demon oh he comes across a little too perfect on  that show what is he really well let's see this is the second person he's dated from the show okay  uh uh the kim uh takara no kim uh uh sister kim you know um kardashian no no no no oh please 
[02:18:30]  uh uh uh i can't name her last name kim coles kim coles kim coles he dated kim coles he's a pimp  man and he likes him big he likes him big i don't wait he's trying to get people to lose weight but  his you know he doesn't go in for the skinny anyway harvey if you're listening someone's gonna listen harvey i  love you you're my man you know this is all fun we have a good time so why why don't you like the  biggest loser that's the show i watch too it's on tonight because a lot of people you know who are  500 pounds he thinks it's more that one he thinks it's more of a of a of a fucking uh it's a mockery 
[02:19:00]  yeah it is it's a mockery they're really trying to help you take a 500 pound guy okay and you run  up the side of a mountain the guy can't climb a freaking flight of steps and you're up a mountain and  then you know he falls over and they always show those those those shots with the blubber  people love that that's great they should put him in a sheep suit when he lays on his back  his little fat arms and legs kick and he can't get up well they make piggy noises the best part of  biggest loser when they weigh in every week they make them take their shirts off why they make them 
[02:19:30]  take their shirts off they don't know what their weight is but for yeah to make that's my point  a lot of these people go back to their old ways because it's almost impossible  yeah you know keep that weight off like at their emails i want to be on celebrity fit club i just  finished biggest lose i gained all my weight back of course you did because you're sitting in the  freaking ranch for six hours exercising with chefs preparing who can't lose weight doing that right  that's not realistic they control everything you do there and then go all right good luck to you  when you get back to the real world when you work at two jobs and you have four fucking screaming 
[02:20:00]  kids michaels thinks that she's some you know military cop running around screaming at people  and then she gets on and says i don't want to have a baby because it's ruined my body  get out of here get out of here do you have somebody that that gains their weight back  and calls you like help like personally off the show and you go  who's called i get paid for this i don't really like you  i'm one of the producers maureen mccormick call me who marie marcia brady  maureen mccormick turn her into some old whore now wait marcia marcia brady wasn't on biggest

[02:21:00]  she's out there as like this old lushy broad which we saw we like in 95 or 96 and that was like right  at the tail end of where she was still like all right she's becoming a country and and then star  and then we saw her you know recently and you still would for nostalgic value though you still  have to you know i've got to put the music on  and then throw a football at her face yeah 
[02:21:30]  you just shoot one on her in the face oh my nose it just goes right up her nose  in that show by the way she's there's a lot of action like you know and then she's she and that  girl jan yeah i forget her real name eve plum like hate each other because she was basically saying that  they kissed each other i was like wow way back then they were getting freaky i mean yeah a little  bit well that's true you know sexual freedom back then wow they were going crazy they did shows for  keith david like they didn't requiem for a dream if anybody remembers the fantastic show he put on for 
[02:22:00]  drugs oh you want to see e-rock because you helped e-rock lose some weight right yes yes he is does he owe you  money yeah come on wait what was the bet again you know what the good thing is for e-rock you you  won't even recognize him because he's lost so much weight so he could just he could just  leave he could walk right in front of you you'll be like i want that as a guy  hold on i want the big reveal with e-rock and we're gonna have to set this up because ian used to do  our show it's been a couple years now and i think it's it don't make sure he doesn't walk in hold on  sam first see if you recognize him great bobby brown scene by the way which which bobby brown 
[02:22:30]  scene talking about the money where he goes you and bobby he owed money if he didn't do something  and weight wise and bobby's like hey motherfucker you just fill it out he'll fill out the check he  threw the check out and then fill it out motherfucker that that was maybe one of the  greatest i mean really top five i mean he was the idea was he kept talking smacking them  loses weight loses weight i said you know what for every pound you don't lose you give a thousand  dollars to the charity of my choice yeah yeah i'm gonna do it yeah he owed us nine thousand dollars 
[02:23:00]  nice and then we called him on it and he brought this crumpled up check  check and he was like he's like here he threw it at me here you fill it out right and i was like  dude i was like you know what we'll give you a shot after the show if you lose the weight we won't  cash the check yeah yeah we didn't cash the check he's gained weight i got two things i feel bad about  who would who would think that bobby round was in better shape than whitney houston first of all  she's a mess and second of all i'm going back to your biggest loser comment where you have everything  jiggling around you say they're they're they're exploiting these people and they're making them take their

[02:40:00]  nfl comes home to live with the paralyzed brother mother and father okay very very good people in it  daryl richell cch pounder and carl weathers it wasn't a bad the rocky thing damn yeah it wasn't  a bad deal now here's the deal you're sitting there watching this show right and straight comes in  they're talking they're having their thing all of a sudden a racist stereotype comes out out of  nowhere like an anti-white thing it's like where did that come what was the stereotype it was like 
[02:40:30]  i don't know something like the white man tip it was it was just like the man or something like  that but the show has nothing to do with that and i'm like i called like yo dude you got to go to  your writers and say first of all you're trying to appeal to you know mainstream america right but  you sit there and make a white racist literally a white racist joke for no reason just thrown like  boom throw it in there the guy in the wheelchair was in the wheelchair because his skinheads uh pounded  his spine into a pulp well they should have they should have so anyways i told him i said dude listen

[02:41:30]  to be so yeah yeah normally for shows the white writers make yeah white jokes because they're  corn balls and they think that making a black joke would be they would never dare write one and  present first of all a white person wouldn't find a joke funny and black people weren't watching that  show anyway because it was corny so who are you writing for like it was it was it was apparently  nobody yeah it was awful he got paid by the way well now you get to beat him up for it  he's awful i told him get out of here you stupid your agent sends you to that show and doesn't  manage it doesn't say let me see some of the scripts yeah you gotta make better choices than that you're

[02:54:00]  we have to live with and i think this is one of those times where he just lost 500 because i mean  he put up the money for his own good basically for his own good and it not only cost him the five it  cost him because he had to do four withdrawals if i come back here if i come back here and

[03:06:00]  he was a dick by telling me that i was but i learned by being in charge of every process the casting  dealing with production and everything else that any kind of  you're a dick if you're aloof you are if you have quiet to your self-confidence but it comes off 
[03:06:30]  like you're not pleasant you're a dick and that's difficult and you can understand why someone would  hire someone who is 60 percent good and 40 percent nice as opposed to 95 percent good and five percent  asshole wow really absolutely carries a lot of weight dude a five percent asshole takes you out of your  zone damn no matter what even if it's not really being an asshole uh it is just the casting people that 
[03:07:00]  will walk in and just be this aloof if you go hey how you doing and it's just like fuck you i'm  talented watch this you go fuck you back so you're you're the guy you're the guy looking at me a bunch  of me's on any level is a strain to life wow it when it's your shit so you realize that maybe over the 
[03:07:30]  years you've well had some yes but it's too late for me to change but i will say oh so you're gonna  continue i will never know i here's what i won't do because even on the set of uh the the the uh  fucking movie me and norton was on fairy vengeance i was an ass really just an asshole but but not how i  thought i thought just being in the cut away from people one word answers walk away was just 
[03:08:00]  it's fucking sucks this is the way a mother feels when her son quits doing drugs  i i can't i'm lucky enough to be able to be an assholes i would be an asshole is what they needed  from on tough crowd you know uh i was difficult there too but they my difficulty was but it worked  for the show yeah uh this one i think my assholeness is welcome you know what i mean like you said it 
[03:08:30]  could be you know tiring whatever you know but it is welcome of course it is yeah i'm pleasant here i'm  happy to be here but any place what i've learned is this i will not do anything that i'm not willing to  to put to be in my lane and be pleasant i will not do because it's it's a to not want to do it to  be unpleasant and do it is even more of a fucking asshole like i'll go no i don't want to do it because 
[03:09:00]  if i can't control the fact that i think i'm funnier than everybody on the set or i just sitting there  going this sucks but i'm here yeah i'm not gonna do it you can't do it i sat there watching casting  people i'm gonna tell you anybody who goes out to casting how is that here's the rule  one try not to go in after 12 why is that because motherfuckers asleep after lunch oh the people  before lunch usually are going to get so they're not paying attention after lunch it's like you got to be 
[03:09:30]  spectacular to be pleasant quiet confidence sucks hello how are you good morning thank you  right which i've never done you've never done that ever i come in walk in and go like let's get through  with this no i come in going eat my left ball i'm better than all of you that's great and with  that attitude you have to be way better than being an asshole right you better you have to be 
[03:10:00]  120 good right because you have to go over the top of the asshole thing yeah which i understand  because i wasn't being an asshole so i thought when i was reading for everybody hates chris but what  happened i was being aloof quiet guy who was good and they go and they said no because there was a kid  who read for the show who was good for what we needed him but we go man i'm not sure if this is 
[03:10:30]  if we're going to be able to deal with this on 16 hour shoots oh i still gave him the part because  i said fuck that i'm not going to do to people what i've been done to me oh look at you after this  thing i go fuck that this is tiring two about trying to get a gig uh three one try to get in before 12 
[03:11:00]  before lunch two be pleasant three dress like the fucking character if you if you come in to play a rich  white guy dress like a rich white guy yeah don't come in in jeans and a t-shirt because you're not  better than the fact of the guy that came in looking like thurston howell the third really you  know i'm serious you go holy shit you look like the guy then you size him up from looking like the guy 
[03:11:30]  see you would think that the acting would stand on its own and he could be wearing anything you go  to be just as good of an actor who doesn't dress up as an asshole so if you come in like a fireman  you go wow this guy looks like a fireman let's see if this fireman can act that's what you're thinking  so that's the casting thing so i come in dressed exactly like me if i was going to read for  fucking a doctor i dress like this like right now with my fucking hat on trying to go nurse hand me the 
[03:12:00]  scaffold and it's like this this fat motherfucker i don't believe in this guy i've done it going  out as a lawyer in an aussie shirt like a douche a lawyer in an aussie shirt ladies and gentlemen of  the jury crazy train yeah what i learned is that if you're not willing to be the boss if you're not  going to willing to be the boss so it trickles down from you don't go on anybody else's shit being 
[03:12:30]  being you stay in your fucking lane i understand that i've been difficult i that's what i understand  not and i can't go well i'll never be difficult it's just don't be difficult on someone else's  shit right do not so that's what i'm apologizing for is being fucking an asshole  fucking on everybody else's shit and i understand what chris rock was meaning even though i was like  what the fuck i didn't even do but but my attitude was enough this is epiphany shit for you enough 
[03:13:00]  that's why you can hire 60 40 he he wasn't as good as this guy but he was fucking pleasant it's gonna  be easy to work with so over the long haul it's gonna be a fucking work with deal with so that was  it that's it i apologize to the people that i've been difficult working eat my he grew up eat my left  ball i'm better than all of you i like that yeah you just walk in like like you're confident let me

[03:17:00]  because you were being i'm an ass they green screened your ass they put a tree in your place  or something i don't fucking matter of fact i had a name in the movie they changed it to construction  work of four that means they've ever done a bunch of that movie went in rome i had a scene in there  they took me out of that uh jimmy show and anthony the dance it's us dancing  and patrice is in the back it's us warming up and patrice isn't even moving it's very bad i'm 
[03:17:30]  just i refuse to warm up for the day i'm difficult wait what are you looking at jimmy doing this dance  is like i don't know what to say is jimmy all in he's all in was all in practicing he was dancing like a  fucking maniac but patrice in the background like damn you know yeah get the fuck out of here but  i was there i should have stayed my fat ass home and not took it that's what patrice just said is 
[03:18:00]  absolutely right it's like we you can both look at that and go this is not good i didn't judge it  as harshly as another film because the kids films like who cares right but the bottom line was i did  show up and i could have just easily said no but i did show up so i was like fuck it i can't  shit big stars in the movie brendan frazier is that hair real it's not a great yeah it's not a  great film honestly you know we don't know that's probably good what what yeah it's real from as far 
[03:18:30]  as i know how bad is it looking person it looks horrible on tv what brendan frazier that's fake hair  no are you guys friends with him he's a very nice guy but the hair is real  holy i guess that's not real what the fuck's going on i don't need to ask you guys any more  questions what the is that that must have been for a role what is he shampooing with chemo  that's for a role dude that's not that's as far as i know he's got a full head of hair that's 
[03:19:00]  probably for a role what the fuck that's what that's for the mummy yeah dude his hair looks so fake  on tv it can't be real what are they what are they talking and a lot of these hair procedures  shots they got a him a lot of the hair procedures are made to make it look good for film and tv and  on tv it looked bad you guys are saying what about his hair anything you don't want to say nothing  no that's what we saw this i'm trying to find footage of patrice dancing no i have footage of him  running down a hill oh fallen i fell yeah he fell yeah that's what we saw we saw you saw 
[03:19:30]  that we saw a full head of hair yeah you saw that version yeah the whole time i don't know yeah  shit huh did he get follicles or did he get um like a net put on his head  oh my god we so need to put this on tv oh you guys miss a lot huh all right so it's real that's what 
[03:20:00]  you saw that's what i saw i'm i'm questioning i don't know about that i'm just questioning a little  bit oh  wait here's something keith in louisville keith i'm sitting around sunday it's raining the kids are  driving me nuts my wife sends me to the movies with them they say they want to see furry vengeance i have 
[03:20:30]  no idea what it is okay i get in there i see these two jokers in one of the very first scenes and i  crack up the entire i'm thinking patrice is playing the angry construction man to a tilt  were you were you supposed to be angry guy no we were supposed to be the here's how awful i am i think  i ruined it me norton and this other kid named eugene was supposed to be the greek chorus we were supposed  to actually tell the story of what's going on in our actions the first time i see the director i go 
[03:21:00]  we've been waiting in this fucking trailer for 14 hours a honey wagon a very small trailer and i and i  and i and i fucking immediately pissed his assistant i and they called him my manager goes is he  it was but after my experience of this you're different i understand i understand no yeah i mean  i would never be on another set and and and behave like i didn't want to be there if i was in the 
[03:21:30]  movie a lot i we were filming a lot when brendan crashes into the water pipes on this construction  site for the second time in like 15 minutes all you see is patrice standing there and he's holding  one of them he just chucks it at the car i guarantee that was not in the script that was just patrice being  pissed at the fact that he was on set that day no that was that was that was that wasn't that  actually in in the uh the script it was it was a it was just it was just that was definitely a uh it 
[03:22:00]  was it was uh supposed to be there and what about jimmy they together they each together they have one line  yeah what wait what what part what what did you think that it was improv what were you thinking  that it wasn't in the uh script  would he chuck the water pipe at fraser's car 
[03:22:30]  i don't i i didn't see it  i didn't i didn't see it he threw the pipe at whose car  oh my god no whose car they're laughing i want to know what's going on here but she's  through the pipe at whose car at chubby brendan frasier's  well did you i mean did you like them did you think it was just terrible it was well  the the uh the six and eight year old thought it was absolutely hilarious 
[03:23:00]  six and eight year old so did you get any points on that because i'm sure they'll probably uh buy the  dvd how how old did the kids know patrice has his headphones on how old are the kids because  it is a kid's movie yeah oh my god i can't believe i'm falling into no patrice has his  headphones now they're back on how old are the kids he's laughing at a picture of brendan frasier  six and eight yeah they're all right so it's it's basically a movie made for kids

[03:38:30]  who are they yeah series title one with the celtics yeah the celtics beat them very easily yesterday and  they were beating them very easily but they just have lapses celtics are good they all but they're  fucking good and lakers you know kobe you know i mean if those they almost lost to these other  fucking fools kobe and them are lucky they're lucky they got utah and if they meet phoenix they're  gonna be in some deep shit if they meet you know it might be i don't see the lakers i think the 
[03:39:00]  lakers is one and done from last year yeah this might do it or orlando might do it orlando's a  fucking powerhouse machine they're beasts but they just mentally so you pretty much picked every  team and said they might do it i look at celtics i see the celtics but that's no different than what  espn does i see the celtics i see the celtics doing it if i if i had to pick if i said the celtics didn't  now go i might go orlando i that would be the next because they just they just got the white  howards a uh a fucking monster the celtics the team looks so funny with that goddamn uniform with
