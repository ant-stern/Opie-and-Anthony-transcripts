<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  It began with a discussion of the fallout from Ben Stein hanging up on the show after a perceived anti-Semitic comment, with Opie and Anthony replaying the audio and defending their actions.  They discussed Stein's reaction, attributing it partly to his father's and his own past experiences with Richard Nixon, including anecdotes of Nixon using anti-Semitic slurs and jokes.  The hosts also recounted media coverage of the incident, particularly from the New York Post, and a call from Corey of Entertainment Weekly further fueled the debate.  This segment featured the repeated use of anti-Semitic slurs and jokes.

The show then transitioned to their "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" promotion, encouraging listeners to display homemade "WOW" signs on their cars.  A caller, Paul, a professional air show performer, offered to write "WOW" in the sky, and other listeners called in to discuss the promotion and various other tangents.  These tangents included discussion of Larry Johnson's Knicks celebration, a listener's successful date facilitated by the show, a review of a wrestling event (Backlash), the show's international online syndication, the temporary removal of ABC from Time Warner Cable, a listener's account of an awkward court case involving a pit bull bite, promotion of Otto and George's puppet show, a show-based drinking game, and mockery of overweight people and their clothing choices.

A subsequent segment featured a call from Andrew Dice Clay, who recounted a positive experience from a previous appearance on the show, crediting it with revitalizing his career and securing a new album deal.  Dice discussed personal struggles (divorce, anxiety), interspersed with explicit sexual humor and celebrity impressions (Chris Walken, John Travolta). The conversation included numerous offensive tangents, particularly jokes about midgets. A brief, humorous interaction occurred with a caller, Mark, who mistakenly believed he was on a suicide prevention hotline.  Dice offered to appear live and they brainstormed album titles, settling on "I'm Over Here Now."  A comedic skit about midgets followed before a commercial break.

Another segment centered on the chaotic distribution of "WOW" stickers by Psycho Mark and Black Earl on Long Island, causing traffic jams near Hofstra University. Listeners called in to describe the mayhem. This section also included discussions of Stone Cold Steve Austin's WWE return (and poor physical condition), the challenges of maintaining their online presence due to website shutdowns, a caller (Steven) berated by Opie for not responding to his name promptly, Opie's LASIK surgery with Dr. Philotoff (and a Memorial Day contest promotion), the Knicks-Heat rivalry, a negative New York Post article about the show and a subsequent call from their boss expressing concern, livery cab violence in NYC (including an archival clip of Reverend Al Sharptonâ€™s satirical solution), and criticism of the MTV VJ search contest.  The segment was filled with profanity and sexually suggestive humor.


The final segment discussed Carson Daly's perceived adoption of "black lingo" and style, mockery of a female VJ candidate for not knowing Michael Jackson, and lengthy details of past interactions with a webcam model, "Sweetness."  Callers from Philadelphia, California, Atlanta, Toronto, and Vietnam checked in, highlighting the show's reach. One caller requested a violent fictional act from Anthony, another discussed the phenomenon of an attractive girl having an unattractive friend.  The show also covered a National Enquirer article about a 21-year-old man who fathered 18 children before being murdered, promoted Fidelity Diamonds, discussed upcoming events involving "Spaz," and addressed criticism from an Indian discussion forum user regarding Anthony's alleged racist remarks about a Pakistani car service driver. The segment concluded with further listener calls and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Brilliant radio at its best.  Oh, God!  Help us!  107, Anthony, WNEW.  Back.  Back.  Ah, yes.  Another week of radio broadcasting.  Hey, it's the O&A Show.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Me first, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  May 1st.  Oh, wow.  There it is.  April Gonzo.  Thank God.  What a crappy month that was.  Out and see.  It's going to be a beautiful week, too, man.  I hope so.  Wow this coming Wednesday is going to completely rock.  Make sure you get your homemade wow signs on the car for Wednesday.  I remember when, you know, occasionally in April you'd get a nice day.  What a miserable April we had.  Yeah, it sucked.  Looking forward to the nice weather.  Man. 
[00:01:00]  This rock.  Well, it is the rock and roll talk show, Anthony.  Nice.  All right, sorry about that.  I miss playing music.  I really do.  Obviously, yeah.  You know, we got to get our kicks off 60-second music bits.  Yeah, I know.  We used to play what we want, you know.  Just be able to pop a few tunes on, take a dump or something. 
[00:01:30]  But now it's like, okay.  The show's gotten too busy, unfortunately.  Yeah.  We would love to play more rock and roll on this show.  Unfortunately, this show has become very important to a lot more people than just us, so I don't understand.  Yeah.  Remember the good old days?  No one gave a crap what we did?  Well, now we got like a lot of, let's just put it this way.  A lot of people checking out our show.  Yeah.  That don't like rock and roll.  Mm-hmm.  So it's kind of tough to play, you know, to take those music breaks now because we're going to just turn off a lot of you people. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  You know, it sort of is fitting into that talk show format.  We try to keep the musical roots to it.  But, you know, it's like a talk show.  You don't hear Bob Grant.  Hey, how about that one?  Yeah, I like that corn.  You son of a bitch.  Corn.  Could the papers please stop writing about us?  Ah.  God damn, man.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  Yeah, we'll get into that a little later.  The Ben Stein thing. 
[00:02:30]  That was pretty funny.  I was very surprised to see any press on that one.  Yeah, that was.  Well, it was just all right.  He hung up, screw him.  He's a douchebag, and that's it.  John Minnelli writing about the Ben Stein hang-up.  It's like, God, we could give you like 20 things to write about on our radio show.  That was like a minor incident.  I guess because, you know, he's a big TV star, Opie, over there on Comedy Central.  Well, we'll get into it later.  I mean, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  We'll play the hang-up one more time, too, with the Richard Nixon stuff.  It's really a part of it.  Cheers.  Cheers.  We've got to thank Ben Stein for being such an a-hole, because he gave us a great hour  of radio Friday.  Yeah, let's think about it.  Ben Stein gets on the phone, does a regular little interview with us.  Okay, five to eight minutes of mediocre radio speaking with somebody that no one really  gives two-flying Fs about.  Right.  End of story.  Or he blows up at what he perceives as an anti-Semitic remark, and we're rolling for an 
[00:03:30]  hour.  For an hour.  Thank you, Ben.  With Richard Nixon.  God, the Richard Nixon was hilarious.  We'll replay that a little later when it gets slow.  Well, we need to take a break.  I read a whole bunch of stuff on that thing over the weekend, like on the computer, reading  about back then when Ben Stein was involved with the Nixon administration and stuff.  And he used to call, because Ben Stein, Ben's father also was big with Nixon, writer and  stuff like that.  And Nixon would call him, where's my Jew boys?  So no wonder Ben's a little sensitive to the whole issue. 
[00:04:00]  He's hyper-sensitive.  Richard Nixon effed it up for everybody that wants to talk to the guy.  He's like shell-shocked with Jew jokes.  Where's my Jew boys?  Jew boys.  Jew boys.  Free checkers.  I love it.  All right.  Well, and a lot of people on the phone lines.  Let's get right to the phones.  We got a lot to do today, once again.  Go Knicks.  Big win over the weekend, Anthony.  Did you see it?  Did you see the L train? 
[00:04:30]  Did you see the L train?  Did you see the L train?  Look, I'm doing it.  I don't even know what it is.  Look at Anthony doing the L train.  I don't even know what it is.  All right, yo.  The L train.  I'm a huge Knick supporter.  That's just the modified FU in Italian, right?  Yeah.  I'm a big Larry Johnson fan, but he's got to calm down a little bit with the L train.  He banked a three-pointer, okay?  Yeah.  You don't bank three-pointers.  Right, right.  He basically threw up a brick and got lucky, and then, you know, to add insult to injury 
[00:05:00]  there, he's giving everyone the L train.  Like, hey, I meant to fall bored.  No, you didn't.  That was the biggest brick of the game.  It went in, though, thank God.  Is that his little thing?  The L train, Opie?  Hell yeah, the L train.  See, I don't know.  Well.  I'm doing it.  You're back in New York.  You've got to know this stuff.  You've got to know the L train.  Well, there's plenty of other things on my list of things to know.  It was an exciting game, though.  I'm studying the early 70s Nixon administration over the weekend. 
[00:05:30]  You're doing the L train.  You should study the early 70s Nick organization.  Okay.  Read up on Clyde Frazier and DeBusher and Wills Reid and Jerry Lucas.  Dave DeBusher.  Dave DeBusher.  Yeah.  Phil Jackson.  Dollar Bill from the corner.  Earl Monroe.  Earl the Pearl, Anthony.  You're very knowledgeable on the basketball, Opie.  Well, I try to be.  Very knowledgeable.  Could you tell us what size diameter each player's fro was back in the 70s?  Big dandelion. 
[00:06:00]  Hey, the fro's coming back in basketball.  You watch.  I see.  You watch.  A couple guys are getting a little brave with the afro on the court.  You watch.  The fro?  By next year, it's going to be rampant again.  We ought to start the afro wall back here in this studio.  We did it up in Boston.  Not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Where we would just clip pictures of people, don't matter, white, black, with afros.  Yeah.  We put it on the wall.  Yeah.  We.  It started from my pistol permit photo.  That's right. 
[00:06:30]  When I got my pistol permit, I had this head of hair.  I'm surprised they gave it to me.  I looked like a terrorist.  Yeah.  I had the big head of frizz on my head.  And somebody thought it was funny and put it up on the wall.  And then they were putting pictures next to it that resembled the fro.  Mm-hmm.  And we're just looking at a wall of afros.  Yeah.  And it turned into the afro wall.  Yeah.  All right.  If you want to mail in afro pictures, that would be great.  Yeah.  We'll put it up on the...  Don't send them through the computer.  It's a pain in the ass to print them out and stuff.  Send them through the snail mail. 
[00:07:00]  And we'll start our afro wall.  We need, like, an Oscar Gamble picture.  An old baseball card of Oscar Gamble would help.  Oscar Gamble was a good one.  And then that hat would fly off.  And it would look like he was wearing an invisible hat over his afro.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  All right.  We'll start the afro wall.  And then when it gets, you know, going nicely, we'll get a picture on the underground website.  I'll kick it off with my old picture from the pistol permit.  Or do you want to make the afro wall behind you there?  Yeah.  We'll take down all those.  That whole corner can be afro wall.  All right.  That's cool.  So send in your afro pictures. 
[00:07:30]  Don't do it through the computer.  No.  Because we want to be able to, you know, just hang it up and stuff.  Russ on line 11 says the L stands for lucky.  No doubt.  Yeah.  That was a lucky three-pointer.  But, hey, it wins a win.  We'll take it any way we can get it.  Yes.  All right.  Let's go to Tom real fast here.  Hey, Tom, what's going on?  Yo, did you guys see Black Glass yesterday?  Uh, yes.  Oh, my God.  Was Big Show dressed up as Hulk Hogan B funny thing on this freaking earth? 
[00:08:00]  It was really?  It was.  I was giggling my balls off.  Holy Jesus.  It was funny.  And he also had the Hulk Hogan rant down.  Yeah, I know.  That was beautiful.  Yeah.  He did the whole move every time he got hit.  And then he did that straight up thing.  And then the stupid leg drop.  Oh, my God.  God, I got to see that part.  I missed it.  I was kind of switching back to the X-Files.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really funny.  I just wanted to catch the main event, but, uh, oh, my God, that turned out to be just  painful to watch.  Well, uh, Stone Cold Steve Austin making a return last night, but a little too early. 
[00:08:30]  Whew.  That was a lot more serious than, I guess, we were all led to believe, his injuries, because  he looked awful.  He looked like, I swear to God, I thought Cardinal O'Connor was coming in with his big, giant,  bald head as Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Because he, he, obviously, isn't able to work out, so he put on some pounds.  He put on a lot of weight.  He's got a big beer belly.  Huge beer belly now.  And then, uh, he was so stiff, his legs, he couldn't move.  At one point, he's in the ring, he swings the chair, hits a Vince with the chair, and 
[00:09:00]  he kind of goes down.  He couldn't get back up.  I'm watching going, oh, this is pathetic, it's painful to watch.  The guy is in bad shape.  His neck's all stiff, he can't move.  Well, they're saying it's going to be at least another two months before he, uh, wrestles,  Anthony.  Yeah?  Well, I, I think it's going to be longer than that.  He'll make some appearances like he did last night at Backlash, but I think it's going  to be, uh, at least two or three months before he gets, uh, wrestling again.  You gotta give it to Vince for roping us in, man.  You know, and in, uh, uh, The Rock's Corner, Stone Cold Steve Austin. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  So, like, okay, well, we'll wait and see what happens.  There'll be some storyline with The Rock and Stone Cold and blah, blah, blah.  Now, there's a, a lame, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Stone Cold Cardinal O'Connor, coming in,  open up a can of whoop-ass holy water on us or something.  He looked awful.  I couldn't believe it.  Yeah.  It was kind of, like, sad to watch.  Yeah, it was a little weird.  Yeah.  But it was, it was definitely a great pay-per-view last night. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Good one.  So, all right, and we gotta take a quick break here.  Mm.  A lot of great phone calls coming in.  If you guys are on hold, stay there.  We'll get to most of you, all right?  Yeah.  Uh, the phone line, 212-757-1027.  That's Steve.  Ladies and gentlemen, the following statement does not necessarily reflect the opinion of  anyone in his right mind.  Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:10:30]  Ah!  1027-WNEW.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Open up.  Meet your door.  Hey.  212-757-1027.  Here's our phone number.  Just mixing up my, uh, crack, O.P.  I see that, Anthony.  I didn't get my, my heroin in the office.  What does Big Cab want?  Big Cab, what's going on, man? 
[00:11:00]  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Real good.  Let me tell you something.  That show last night was unbelievable at Rascals.  Oh, Otto and George?  Absolutely incredible.  Yeah.  Otto and George, Jeff Norris, two other guys I can't remember at the moment.  Absolutely incredible.  You guys should have been there.  How was the crowd?  Hysterical.  Laughing so loud.  We were sitting in the, I was sitting in the back with Stephen Lynch and, uh, fellow  hanger-on, Mark.  And, uh, we, we, we were missing stuff because the crowd was so loud for Otto and George. 
[00:11:30]  It was amazing.  Yeah.  That was the funniest goddamn puppet.  Absolutely.  It's, it's even better when you, you see the visual.  I mean, we were laughing so hard in the studio when we had him on, but obviously this is radio,  so you don't get to see the expressions that the, the puppet makes and stuff.  So, so, so I'm glad a lot of people went and, and got to see the, the whole act, man.  There happened to be, uh, a midget in the audience.  Oh, no.  So, uh, you can imagine.  Yeah.  George must have torn him. 
[00:12:00]  The whole night.  I was supposed to go, but then I couldn't get, I, I, I, I couldn't peel myself, uh, myself  away from the TV.  Too much, uh, playoff basketball on yesterday.  Right.  Jeff Norris is really funny, too.  Yeah, he's good, man.  Yes, he is.  Oh, very funny.  I think they're, I think they're all going to do it again.  I, I'm hearing rumors next Tuesday at Rascals.  Uh, can we, can we, uh, announce that show, uh, Rick?  Officially, do we know?  Kind of, sort of.  Kind of, sort of.  They're thinking of doing one in the very near future.  It may be next Tuesday with Otto and George again, because, uh, because a lot of people 
[00:12:30]  got shut out because it was a sold-out show last night.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of seat in the house.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Take care.  Cool.  Let's go to Paul real fast.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, Paulie.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  All right, how are you guys doing?  Great.  Good.  You got that, that special coming up on Wednesday?  Uh, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, yes.  Yeah, well, I'm going to see if I can get permission to, uh, put W-O-W over the city  and, uh, trail of smoke behind my airplane.  Oh.  What, are you a skyrider?  Yeah, well, no, actually, I'm a professional air show performer.  What do you fly? 
[00:13:00]  Uh, an extra 200.  Oh, those things kick ass.  I love that one on the little Microsoft simulator.  Yeah, that's the one that Patty Wagstaff flies.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I'm based up at Sussex.  Anytime you guys want to go, you got a free ride coming.  Paul, your face does all kinds of funny things, Opie, in that plane.  It sure does.  You can turn it up on its side and then upside down and back on its side so fast.  We cruise down the Hudson upside down.  Upside down?  Oh, yeah.  You ever do any, uh, any underneath, uh, the bridge flying?  Uh, I'm not going to comment. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, I bet.  Oh, what do they do?  These guys, dude, these guys love doing this.  You hug the river, right under the Verrazano.  Under the bridge.  It's a trip.  Yeah.  It would not like the air.  We're up at the Sussex Air Show.  That's like that kind of plane that was, uh, like sponsored by Bud and stuff.  You ever see those planes?  Yeah, that was a Lazier 200 that was flown by Leo Loudenswager.  Yeah.  You got to take Ann for a ride.  Yeah, if he wants to go.  Oh, God.  Uh, you got, you got something you could strap over my mouth so when I just puke my guts  up, I'll be okay?  We'll give you a big old Ziploc bag. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, that'll help.  Yeah, you get to wear a parachute.  Okay, great.  You can stick up front.  You can fly the airplane a little bit.  What are the odds of getting wow in the sky this Wednesday?  Well, I'm going to work on it.  I, I already got a call into the FAA and, uh, they wanted to know what I was going to write,  so I told them I was going to write mom.  Hey, there you go.  There you go.  Holy smoke.  Okay, Mother's Day's coming up.  Yep.  And, and when you get in trouble, go, well, the plane was upside down when I was writing  mom.  It all depends on where you are.  Some people will see mom. 
[00:14:30]  Sure.  So I've been, I've been practicing it a couple of times.  I think I got it down pat.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I love it, man.  If you make that happen, man, oh, you got to let us know so we get, we'll have a lot  of people looking up in the sky wherever you're going to do it.  Okay, well, if I do it, it'd probably be, uh, Wednesday, of course, Wednesday.  Yeah.  Um, probably over the Hudson, about 10,000 feet, if I can get the clearance.  And it'd probably be around between 5 and 530.  How big of a wow do you think he could get in the sky?  Oh, it's going to be big.  You can see it everywhere.  It'll be a biggie. 
[00:15:00]  All right, listen, we got to talk to you.  Rick's going to talk to you off air.  Okay.  Paul, thank you.  No problem.  Paul the sky rider trying to get wow in the sky this coming Wednesday.  Planes are sick fast, man.  Sick.  I wouldn't do well in one of those planes.  I would not do well.  Make sure you get your wow signs for the cars.  This Wednesday is going to be great.  We have a great week of weather ahead of us.  Yeah.  Um, you know, I mean, a lot of people are waiting to pick up the wow stickers.  You can get them at the, uh, the Ranch One locations, the participating Ranch One locations. 
[00:15:30]  Yes, Sophie.  The brand new wow sticker.  You can send a self-addressed stamped envelope in, uh, just, uh, write 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Just get double-do any double-do and wow sticker on the envelope, okay?  Right.  And, uh, but the best thing is just to make the homemade wow sign for Wednesday because you're not going to want to miss out.  A lot of girls emailing us saying, hey, I'm ready to wow my 36 double-Ds, but I don't see any wow signs on the damn highway.  Got to get them out there, man.  So, get them on the cars.  Yeah, because, I mean, the wow season is finally upon us, and we're very excited about it. 
[00:16:00]  All right, uh, where else do we want to go here?  There's so much freaking stuff going on.  Uh, let's go to Matt real fast.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  How are you?  I want to let you know that you guys are now syndicated underground internationally.  Oh, really?  Yes, uh, a friend of mine over the internet who, uh, lives in Canada is now turning all his friends on to you guys.  Oh, Canada.  Bunch of flap heads.  Very nice.  They can't, they can't stop us on the internet.  Uh, I wonder how the southern boss would react now that you guys could probably cause an international incident. 
[00:16:30]  Well, he's a little pissed at us today because another celebrity walked off our show, so.  We might, we might get into that a little later.  All right, no problem, guys.  Syndication underground.  All right, man, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Syndication any way possible.  Absolutely.  People are spreading the word through the internet and chat rooms, putting clips of our show all over the place.  Ah, it's just something that I, I can't be stopped.  You know how the internet is, man.  It's free. 
[00:17:00]  It's all over.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, fellas.  How's it going today?  Hi, guys.  Pretty good.  Welcome back from the weekend.  Thank you.  Uh, Opie, I had the pleasure of meeting your partner this weekend, Saturday night.  Yes, I was down at Lemoore.  The rock capital of Brooklyn.  Let me tell you something.  It's very strange.  Anthony becoming the social one out of the duo here.  I used to be the social one.  Now I'm the hermit, and Anthony's the one getting out there.  When were you a social butterfly, Opie?  I was, I think I was more social than you were.  Hell no.  I think so.  I was out every night. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You're, like, showing up at places, and I, a French band, a tello, was playing at Lemoore.  I went down to support him and check him out.  Right on.  I think it was more for the Mike Tramp, formerly of White Lion, show.  Did you hang around for that, or did I catch you singing along to the Bon Jovi cover, you must say?  So we've graduated from No Doubt, have we?  Chris, you're a tool. 
[00:18:00]  Thank you.  Oh, man.  I am major impressed.  Let me tell you, I didn't hang out for the Mike Tramp set.  I left just before they started.  Actually, they played one song, and the place was, like, empty.  Yeah, everybody just cleared it out.  Like, everyone just cleared it out.  Oh, poor guy.  It was pretty funny, man.  It's Mike Tramp's new band.  It used to be in White Lion, huh?  White Lion.  I'm standing on.  Very nice guy.  Hold on, hold on.  Way to go. 
[00:18:30]  Did someone hang up on him?  No, he hung up on himself.  Oh, Greg.  Yeah, I want to say hi to everybody that I met there.  Everyone really cold coming up saying hi.  Oh, got to thank, uh...  Oh, I can't even listen to it as a joke, even.  Got to thank Frank.  Right?  That's, like, bringing back horrible memories.  Frank, help me out.  Frank, what did Frank do?  Frank, uh, one of the, uh, wall officers in our fine city.  Give me a couple of things. 
[00:19:00]  A couple of things?  A couple of things.  Just got to say thank you.  I won't say the last name or nothing.  Are you going to share with your pal?  What do you got?  I'm not saying.  I just got a couple of things, you know, that prominently displayed on the motor vehicle  might help me out in some future, uh, issues.  You know what you're going to do with that decal?  I know, I know, I know.  Yeah.  I gave it a test run today.  I don't think I stopped for one red light.  I'm passing cars in the battery tunnel like a maniac over the double yellow. 
[00:19:30]  Just because you have this nice new decal.  I don't know.  All I'm saying is when I'm in the battery tunnel and I get behind a goddamn bus or a cement mixer,  I'm not waiting.  We're all moving in one general direction.  I don't care if there's a line there and don't pass,  and the guy that gets on and interrupts your radio in the middle of it playing.  I don't know how they do that.  No matter what station you listen to, you're in the middle of the battery tunnel and you hear,  Hello, welcome to the battery tunnel.  Please stay in your lane.  Use the easy pass only if you got an easy pass. 
[00:20:00]  Exact change makes it more convenient for everyone involved.  Thank you.  Or I'll break your leg.  For using the mother effing battery tunnel.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  I haven't heard that recording in a while.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah, so.  Yeah, a lot of cool people saying hi on Saturday.  All right.  Thanks, man.  And you didn't stay for Mike Tramp's new band?  No, it was like one tune because I just wanted to like, you know, see what he's up to. 
[00:20:30]  You got to know when to give it up.  There's a lot of these bands from the 80s and they just don't know when to give it up.  Yeah, it was a little, uh, it was a little weak at the beginning of a set there and everybody had cleared out, you know.  I feel bad for some of these bands that, like, play The Garden and the next thing you know they're playing like a little...  The Garden!  They're playing like these clubs that hold 200, you know, 200 people and they're convinced that the whole 80s scene is coming back or something again.  Yeah.  It ain't happening.  Hey, I played Madison Square Garden. 
[00:21:00]  I'm crying over here.  Did you see that?  It's an old one, the E, uh, True Hollywood Story about Dice.  We got to get the audio clip of him crying on Arsenio Hall's show.  You know, I work hard.  12 years.  And then he snaps out of it with his cigarette move.  Yeah.  Like, and a movie's coming and my movie's coming out tomorrow.  And you're all laughing your ass off. 
[00:21:30]  It's like, oh, Dice, Jesus Christ, man.  I'm crying over here.  We got to bring that up next time he calls the show.  I'm crying over here now.  Yeah, right?  Well, let's, uh, let's, uh, get a copy of that.  If someone has a copy of that, please, uh, get it to the show for us, all right?  Yeah, I was watching.  I couldn't get the...  I couldn't put a damn tape in my VCR and just leave it there.  And just with the record thing ready to go at any moment.  I see stuff.  I'm running around like a chick went out of head.  I was watching some court show the other night.  I could kill myself.  I want to call the place just to get this tape. 
[00:22:00]  It was unbelievable.  It's, uh, the new, the new judge, the black guy who used to be like a crackhead or something  and they made him a judge.  I don't know.  There's too many judges.  I know.  There's like a thousand of them.  I can't keep track of it anymore.  Well, uh, there was the, uh, the plaintiffs were, um, these, uh, of mother and father whose  son got bitten by a pit bull and the owner of the pit bull was there saying that it wasn't  her fault.  Well, the father of this kid that got bitten by the pit bull could be possibly the most  illiterate man I've ever seen on television ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. 
[00:22:30]  And he's crying and yelling, now I'm a man of God, y'all, but I'm feeling the old ways  coming back.  My child coming to me crying.  I'm like, it's okay, boy.  It's okay.  And he's crying and screaming, I'm rolling on the floor laughing.  You've got to push recording.  I couldn't find a tape.  I'm running around.  I even got like so close to putting a piece of tape over the, uh, record thing on a porno  tape.  Then I thought better.  Hey, I need this. 
[00:23:00]  You might need that.  No, I, I couldn't find a tape.  I was going crazy.  But the guy was flipping out.  Y'all know, I'm a man of God.  We need a copy of that too.  Freaking.  I don't even know what the guy is.  We're the faithful listeners.  We need the judge sexual chocolate show or something.  Yeah, we need, we need those two tapes.  We need the dice and we need the black judge's, uh, show.  Yeah.  I don't even know what the guy is talking about there.  Oh, no.  Uh, Jeff Norris is, uh, calling to confirm that, yes, indeed, Otto and George will be  playing next Tuesday night.  Uh, Jeff Norris.  How we doing, fellas? 
[00:23:30]  How was it last night, Rascals?  Oh, my God.  I'm so pissed I didn't go.  Unbelievable.  We were looking for you.  It was unbelievable.  I was supposed to go, but, uh, the, the Laker game was too good last night.  The place was packed with ONA fans.  I, I went on the stage.  He goes, anybody ever listen to Opie and Anthony?  It took like 10 minutes for him to shut up.  Oh, that's cool.  But, uh, it was, yeah, we're going to be back there, uh, May 9th.  All right.  And it's going to be, uh, simulcasted over to, uh, Rascals Internet.  Oh, nice.  So if you can't make the show, you can get it over the computer if you're too cheap.  And, uh... 
[00:24:00]  Hey, shut up, you big gorilla.  I know.  That's what he kept you.  Hey, Otto's on stage.  He goes, I'm thirsty.  He goes, get me something to drink.  So I bring him a glass of water, and he has George going, I am big and strong like Arnold.  I'm walking up to the stage, and Otto goes, leave Jeff alone.  He's my friend.  George goes, yeah, he's a big gorilla.  I bet you if I paint my bleep yellow, he'll go for it.  Think it's a banana.  It was the best.  And then the 16th will be in Ocean Township.  All right.  So, uh...  All right.  So March 9th, next Tuesday.  Let's go one week at a time here. 
[00:24:30]  Rascals, West Orange?  Absolutely.  Otto and George, I'm telling you.  Everyone that went last night had a great time.  It was great.  Uh, Otto and George.  Uh, Otto and George.  Otto have a good time.  Oh, he was...  He was unstoppable.  Oh, good.  He was unstoppable.  He couldn't get out of character all night.  I'm like, hey, uh, good job tonight.  I know.  He goes, yeah, whatever.  Whatever.  All right.  Cool, Jeff.  Thanks, fellas.  All right.  Later, man.  See you soon.  I'm telling you, you guys are going to be pissed if you call, like, tomorrow and it's  sold out.  Yeah.  West Orange, next, uh, next Tuesday.  Otto and George doing another show. 
[00:25:00]  Did anyone catch the hot anal sign on heat last night?  Get out of here.  Those signs are getting better and better, man.  Yeah.  Anal.  I have an idea for Vince.  He's got to rotate those signs.  What do you mean?  Because someone will have a really good sign, like, the front row or the second row.  Yeah.  And then you see the sign, you know, throughout the whole event.  Yeah.  You should somehow figure out how he could just keep rotating signs.  So every time.  Oh, everyone passed one to the left or something? 
[00:25:30]  Something.  So you get all those crazy signs on TV.  Because there's a lot of them that just never make it on, on, on, on the air.  They get very proud of their signs.  All right.  Some guy, uh, he hung up though, unfortunately.  A guy wants to play, uh, what?  Hold on a second.  Hey, Matt, what's going on?  Guys, how are you?  Great.  I got, dude, you guys made me have the best date this weekend.  I'm going to protect the names for the purpose of protecting the innocent.  I had a date Saturday night with a girl that a friend of mine fixed me up with. 
[00:26:00]  I met her once before.  She was amazing looking.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  We go out for some drinks.  We tie a few on.  Go back to my house.  She decides in a drunken state that she wants to play truth or dare.  Uh, that means you're getting some.  Uh, yeah.  Um, so I said to her, after, uh, we go back and forth, I said, my turn, truth.  I said, Mohawk, Hitler mustache, barewood floor.  Uh, she grabs my hand, puts it into her pants, and says, barewood floor, ONA. 
[00:26:30]  Oh!  Oh!  So I thank you, gentlemen, from the bottom of my heart.  Nice.  What show gets you laid?  What?  Dude, you guys.  Virgin.  Virgin.  But I had a share.  What radio station gets you laid?  1-0-2-7, talk FM, the L.P. and Anthony station.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  That's cool, man.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Take care.  Have a good one.  All right.  Oh, man, this is so intense. 
[00:27:00]  Nice.  That is great.  All right, let's go back to the phones here.  Al, what's going on?  Hey, Al.  Yellow.  Al?  Al, uh, Pete.  Pete.  Uh, John.  John.  Sammy.  Sammy.  Bobby.  Okay.  Buddy.  What's your name?  Rick isolated that call from Friday when I just lost my mind when we went to the phone  and the guy wouldn't answer to his own name.  Yeah, that was a good one.  All right, let's, what?  Nope, nope, nope.  What?  It has not been edited. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, it still has all the curses?  Oh, I edited it real fast.  Oh, wow, we can't play with the curses now, can we?  Well, they didn't hear, no one heard it because we dumped out of the show because it was so  rude.  You were out of your mind pissed.  I just lost it because the guy wouldn't answer to his own name and then we finally get him  on the line and we say, what is your name?  And it was the name I was calling.  We were all really cranky Friday, so it was kind of funny.  There's nothing wrong with us being a little cranky.  Yeah, I like going a little cranky.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, I don't mean to change subject voice, but I just got something for Anthony here.  Yes. 
[00:28:00]  You're into toys, right?  Yeah.  Get the TiVo system.  Oh, yeah.  You'll never need a VCR tape again.  I know, I got it.  It's so great.  I'm just waiting for my wall unit so I can put my TV in there and hook everything up.  Yeah, TiVos are unbelievable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The thing is, the best thing I've ever seen in my life.  You never miss a TV show again.  Yeah.  Why don't you explain TiVo real fast?  Well, you can hit pause at any time.  On live TV.  Yeah, and if you're watching something and you really want to finish watching it, all  you've got to do is hit record, and you can leave the room, you know, come back later 
[00:28:30]  and watch the rest of your show.  Yeah, you watch something else.  You could come in.  You could have a tape in a show when you're out, and then you get in and say the show is  halfway done.  You could start watching the beginning of it while it's taped and the end of it.  Yeah.  Yep.  That's it.  It's the greatest machine out.  Yeah, pretty cool.  I just got to hook it up.  I got my TV on the floor still.  I'm living like a goddamn derelict.  All right, guys.  Syndication on the ground.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Oh, you can't pause ABC, I got it.  Okay. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Yeah.  Goddamn, huh?  That is messed up.  There's no ABC on Time Warner.  I can't believe it.  What happened?  I can't get on TV.  It's my show live with Regis and Kathy Lee.  He was so pissed this morning.  Off the air.  As soon as I knew that, you know, there was no ABC on Time Warner, you know, I don't have  Time Warner, so I'm checking out ABC with the Regis and Kathy Lee this morning.  Regis was just ballistic pissed.  Pissed off, man.  Because everything is going so well for him with the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. 
[00:29:30]  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.  And Regis and Kathy Lee, and now there's just millions of people that can't watch either  show.  Not in New York.  Yeah.  I guess Disney and Time Warner are having their issues.  So, uh, Time Warner just kind of pulled the plug on ABC.  It's funny, because you tune in to ABC in the office.  Yeah.  And obviously it's not on, because we've got Time Warner here.  And it says, Disney has taken ABC away from you.  You don't realize that, like, if you're not up to date on what's going on, you think that 
[00:30:00]  Disney owns the cable company, and they pulled ABC.  It's not the fact.  Disney and ABC are owned by the same company.  They are the same company.  And it was the Time Warner that pulled them off.  Oh, there it is.  Disney has taken ABC away from you.  And they're telling you how you can go to, like, Radio Shack, buy antennas and switches  and vacuum tubes.  I don't know what the hell you need.  Like, you're going to take this rabbit ear antenna thing from Radio Shack and put it on 
[00:30:30]  your nice brand new TV.  Your brand new, like, uh, yeah, large screen TV.  Sure.  Sure, that'll work.  And they'll, uh, I guess if you send them the bill.  They'll reimburse you.  Up to 15 bucks for the cost of, like, an A-B switch and you need switches and they're  just, people can't even set their clock.  They're going to put A-B switches and rabbit ears and tie it into their system so they know  what to do.  They're just screwed.  Get out of town.  They're just screwed.  Unbelievable.  Do they honestly think just millions of people are going to go out and get antennas so they 
[00:31:00]  can watch their ABC?  Watch, I gotta watch Miljana.  It ain't happening.  This is one of the problems with a big business.  How long is this going to last?  Until, uh, Disney and, uh, Time Warner can hammer out some kind of a deal.  Well, at this point, if you're ABC, don't you think, uh, you would, uh, you know, work  this out immediately?  I guess the, the, the amount of money they gotta be, uh, losing in revenue has gotta be insane.  Yeah, but it's not just ABC.  Disney has to work the deal out with them.  A lot of these companies own a lot of other things.  That's what happened with, uh, deregulation.  They bought a bunch of everything. 
[00:31:30]  So now, like, uh, Fox had a problem like this in the past.  Because they wanted to, uh, they wanted the cable system that's carrying them to carry  Fox, FX, the Fox family thing, like, the whole package.  And the cable company said no.  And they couldn't hammer a deal out.  So they said, all right, no Fox then.  And pulled everything off of their system.  Wow.  It's, it's scary.  Because now it's huge corporations battling, and who pays?  Rageous.  Yeah.  The consumer.  People that, uh, want to watch TV.  We always get used. 
[00:32:00]  And it's only going to get worse.  Worse.  Worse.  Worse.  It's only going to get worse when, uh, more and more companies just consolidate.  So ugly.  All right, Ed.  Let's take a break, huh?  You know, there's other situations in this country where, let's say, let's say there's  a real successful, uh, like, radio show.  Right.  Uh, some people in a company would keep them from doing mornings because it conflicts with  someone else in the company.  Hmm.  Now, years ago, this wouldn't have happened.  Mm-hmm.  But with, uh, conglomeration. 
[00:32:30]  And consolidation.  And consolidation.  These things happen.  Sure.  Hmm.  Interesting.  But then again, I don't think those, uh, radio hosts would, would do well waking up  real early anyway, so.  I'm speaking hypothetically.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But I'm a hypothetical radio host.  Yeah, I'm just thinking as a DJ that, you know, I know, personally, I wouldn't want  to get up at, like, four, so.  Well, if one of them could put the bottle down and one of them could get off the Valium. 
[00:33:00]  We better take a break, man.  You're killing me.  Okay.  I don't want the Southern Boss.  Stop it.  I got compliments, uh, for my Ben Stein impression Friday.  Really?  Just when you thought I couldn't do an impression.  And I, I was like Gallagher, too.  Almost as good as Anthony.  I reviewed the, uh, Opie and Anthony drinking game.  Yeah.  And, man, people must have been crocked.  Yeah, there's a drinking game out there, and it says every time, uh, Opie does, uh,  a voice, what, you gotta slam a whole beer?  You gotta do the whole beer. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  It's pretty funny.  But I'm like Gallagher, too.  Not quite as good as Gallagher at smashing the watermelon, but I'm giving it a good effort.  It looks okay from the background.  Yeah.  Gallagher.  Gallagher, too.  I understand that.  I could do, I could, nah, never mind.  I would be tooting my own horn, and we don't do that here.  Okay, Anthony, let's take a, let's take a quick break, and we'll be back, okay?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh.  Don't ever underestimate the cycle factor in my head. 
[00:34:00]  Are you mental?  No!  It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stock-raving mad person.  No!  Look at that!  No!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the cycle factor in my head.  No!  O.B.M.  Anthony.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony, stacker two of the world's strongest fat burner. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  Got to lose weight, hmm?  Do you pack on some of the pounds during the, uh, during the winter?  When you're hiding under your big coat?  Well, now it's May.  May 1st, Opie.  And, uh, the warm weather's gonna be right around the corner, I hope.  I'm disgusted with April.  April, a real letdown.  And it gave the people more of a chance to pack on more pounds.  Well, a lot of people eat when it's, uh, you know, gloomy out.  Yeah.  They get depressed and they just feed their fat faces.  Well, now you're gonna, uh, take the coat off and what are you gonna look like?  It's gonna look like, uh, your ass, like, uh, two big things of cauliflower? 
[00:35:00]  Mmm.  Does it look like that?  Mmm, yum, yum.  Give me some.  You got the big belly over the, uh, the big overall awning belly.  Hanging over your private region?  The bunt.  Right.  Let's talk about the bunt real fast.  Ladies.  The stretch pants with the big sweater.  It's not happening.  It doesn't work.  Everyone sees right through what you're trying to do.  You're trying to cover up the bunt.  Who's wearing the, the, who is overweight and wearing the black stretch pants in the supermarket?  The black stretch pants with the long sweater. 
[00:35:30]  The long sweater.  Or the long or big sweatshirt.  Some of them don't wear the, uh, don't even wear the sweater to pull it over the butt.  So you see, ladies, you can't look in the rear.  You can't see back there.  But everyone that's looking at you is seeing it.  You have the dual buttocks.  It's like a conjoined twin butt on your own butt.  You ever see that?  There's a big fat butt.  And then right at ground zero. 
[00:36:00]  You know what that is?  A small butt.  That's a fat lady that's wearing, uh, tight patties.  Yeah.  Because it kind of like explodes out the sides and stuff.  So they have the mini butt in the middle.  Yeah.  And the rest of the butt on the outside.  Because you've never seen the panties big enough for that huge butt.  No matter how big women are, they could buy you, oh, my panties.  They're all the same size.  If your butt looks like two hoppity hops, you might want to give stacker two a call, man.  And I don't even want to talk about the fupa.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no. 
[00:36:30]  The fupa.  F-U-P-A.  Well, look.  You're going to have to shed the clothes.  Upper.  Fat, upper, P.  Area.  Area.  Very good.  You're going to have to shed the, uh, pounds once you shed the clothes.  Stacker two.  World's strongest fat burner.  Forty-five minutes after taking it, you'll feel its effects.  It, uh, burns the fat, builds lean muscle, gives you a boost to energy if you're petering  out during the day, and, uh, it cuts down on your cravings to snack and pick at the  Twinkies.  And that adds up to losing weight. 
[00:37:00]  Give them a call.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Their phone number is 1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it works.  All right, here it comes.  Anthony is evil, but hope he's worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the, uh, Bopey and, uh, Cruel and Inhumans show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Oh!  It's the O&A show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:37:30]  I didn't, I didn't think this whole Ben Stein thing was, uh, a big deal.  I guess the Post ran, uh, a huge article on, uh, on the fact that Ben Stein hung up on us  on Friday, Anthony.  Well, Opie Ben Stein, uh, I don't know, he's been in some movies.  He's on TV now, so I guess it's a big issue.  But, uh, especially the whole, uh, you know, racially charged thing.  The whole, uh, anti-Semitism thing that he's bringing up.  Which is just ludicrous.  It's just ridiculous.  I guess the faithful listeners know what, uh, happened. 
[00:38:00]  We're gonna even replay the tape in about an hour.  Ben Stein.  Uh, basically we were doing a live read for CarCash, one of our newer sponsors.  Yeah.  We love CarCash, 1-800-CAR-CASH.  Yes.  But, um, well, I was saying that, uh, if you take an ad out in the newspaper, you might  get somebody that will come over to the house and try to chew the price down.  Chew.  As in nibble away at the price you took such an effort to make up for your automobile.  Chew the price down.  He was on hold listening to the commercial. 
[00:38:30]  He, uh, he gets on the phone and goes, uh, who said, uh, did I hear someone say,  Jew the price down.  No, I said, chew it down.  And then he made this whole thing like, it doesn't even matter that I said chew, because  what I really meant was Jew, and what everyone will hear is that, uh, they will try to Jew  the price down.  Racial slur, you know, anti-Semitic slur.  So he gets all pissed off.  I, I said he was insane that he is acting like a lunatic, and he hung up on it. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, he couldn't even deal with it.  At which point we got so mad we, uh, may have, maybe have delved into the, uh, anti-Semitic.  Well, the Richard Nixon, uh, telling, uh, Jewish jokes was pretty damn funny to be honest.  Well, when you got a guy, Ben Stein, who, uh, during the Nixon administration was a speech  writer for Tricky Dick.  Ben Stein's father wrote for a Tricky Dick.  And, uh, I don't know, from what I'm reading and heard on these tapes and, uh, allegations 
[00:39:30]  other people have made, it seems that, uh, Richard Nixon was one of the biggest anti-Semites  and racists around.  He would call Ben Stein and, uh, the other people, uh, that were writing speeches for him.  My Jew boys.  Get me my Jew boys.  Where's Kissinger?  Where's my head Jew?  Ben, Ben, come here.  Look, Ben, a penny rolled under my desk in the Oval Office.  Go get it.  Go get it, Jew. 
[00:40:00]  Richard Nixon.  But he, you know, he pocketed that check.  I guess that's what made him a little oversensitive.  Man, well, a lot of people are on the, on the phone saying,  The hippies and the Jews are out to get me.  Checkers, you're my only friend.  Are you a Jew hound?  Well, and a lot of people on the phone lines, they're saying,  If you listen closely to Ant, you definitely said Chew.  That's not even the issue.  We, we played the tape back a million times.  Anthony definitely said Chew.  You know what gets me the most?  Not Jew.  The most?  If you listen to Ben Stein's reaction, he says, 
[00:40:30]  Uh, I said, I said Chew.  I made sure I said Chew.  He goes, Yes, but, uh, people will know that you said Jew.  He said that.  Though I said Chew, he said people will know I said Jew.  Jew.  Boy, if that ain't twisting it around.  No, I didn't.  I said Chew.  And who cares?  So, so, uh, we didn't make a big deal of it Friday, because it's our show.  Stuff like this happens on a daily basis.  All the time.  We have, we have celebrities walking out and stuff, and then hanging up on us. 
[00:41:00]  The Rock says, I'm leaving.  Right.  Remember that one?  And, you know, we, we have fistfights in the studio, whatever.  We didn't, we didn't really think it was a big deal, but, uh, John Minnelli of The Post  thought it was a big deal, wrote a huge article on it in The Post today.  I'll beat up Ben Stein.  Can I do that?  Yeah, you can do that.  I'm a big pussy, so I gotta, like, beat up people I know I can take.  Oh, man.  Hey.  So, so, so we want, so we want, so we want to move on, but the, the Post, the Post writes the,  the, the article, and now, uh, Rick's telling me that someone wants to talk to us about 
[00:41:30]  this on the phone line, Rick.  Yeah, his name is, uh, Corey from Entertainment Weekly.  Oh, really?  Ooh, Entertainment Weekly.  I get that publication.  Corey.  Hello.  How are ya?  Hey, how's it going?  What's, uh, I guess we just explained the whole thing to you on the air, but.  Okay, so, so am I on right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, we should tell you that.  I'm sorry.  Um, basically, what was he coming on the show to do, anyway?  I guess promote, uh, his, uh, new season of Win Ben Stein's Money.  Okay, had he, had he been on before?  Were they, which, which, which is really breaking down the stereotypes there. 
[00:42:00]  A Jewish guy who's really stingy with his cash, uh, gives you the chance to win, and if  you win his money, he gets all pissed off.  Boy, really breaking down some stereotypes there, uh, Ben.  Now, now, had you had run-ins with him before?  No, no, it was the first time we've had him on the show.  We were going to have him on, be very cordial, like we are with all of our guests.  I'm sure, yeah.  And, uh, until something happens, does Corey listen to the O.P. and Anthony show?  From time to time.  Yeah, I hear the sarcasm in your voice there, Corey. 
[00:42:30]  We never draw first blood, Corey.  We never draw first blood.  But, uh, no, go ahead.  We were just, we were just going to let him, uh, plug his show, and I actually wanted to  get into a little bit about when he was, uh, a speech writer for Nixon.  That's interesting.  And, uh, right off the bat, he was on hold listening to that spot.  He heard what he thought he heard.  Even then, I was fine with it, because if he thought he heard me say, Jew, down the  price, and it offended him, well, that's fine.  But when I explained that I did indeed say, Chew, and he still was, was pounding me, like, 
[00:43:00]  like I, I, I was painting swastikas on my forehead and marching, uh, down Ocean Parkway,  uh, the guy came off like a lunatic, and I called him that.  I said he was insane and acting like a madman.  Now, did you guys reconcile this at all, or, or is it just, uh, it ended when he, when  he hung up the phone?  No, he hung up the phone.  We actually tried to get him back on the phone, because, uh, even then, I thought, uh, maybe  he had this little sense of humor in him somewhere, and he was playing some kind of joke. 
[00:43:30]  But no, he, he is insane.  He is a mad person.  Could you understand, though, how he might have, uh, I mean, is, is that a phrase commonly  used, Chew?  Chew?  Chew, I, I have heard it and used it many times.  Where it comes from, who the hell knows?  If it came from Chew down, fine.  But I didn't say Chew down.  Right.  I mean, maybe he thought it was some way, in some way, derivative of that.  I don't know.  He obviously.  You know what?  You know what he thought?  He thought that Chew is too close to Chew, and that's why he went crazy, which is so friggin' 
[00:44:00]  dangerous.  If we start getting to a point in this country where things that sound like something that's  offensive are offensive, then I, just cash it in.  Can I get an island somewhere, somewhere in the Pacific where I could be left alone?  Because that is dangerous ground.  So besides the, uh, the post article, have you guys heard any calls from listeners?  Uh, mostly people supporting our side.  Yeah.  That was completely ridiculous.  Except for some Jews.  Corey, have you heard the whole thing? 
[00:44:30]  No, I'm about to get the tape from you guys, so.  Yeah, we'll send you the tape.  You'll listen yourself.  And you know something?  Whenever I'm speaking on the air, I try to have a split-second delay in my head, just  so I know where I stand when crap pops out of my mouth.  And I said, uh, okay, I'm going to say Chew down.  Let me make sure I enunciate Chew down so as not to cause a problem.  Not that I care about a problem, but I just didn't want one in a commercial read.  You know what I mean? 
[00:45:00]  Right, right.  So I said, Chew down.  You heard it.  Everyone heard it as Chew down, except Ben Stein.  I heard you.  I heard you call me a kike.  You know, he lost his friggin' mind.  The guy's insane.  He's certifiably insane.  You know that booth they lock him in on Win Ben Stein's money?  Right, right.  Lock it and leave him in there.  Because he's dangerous to society.  Now, what about the Nixon jokes you guys have been making? 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  Is this a little bit out of context?  That's just comedy.  That's just money stuff.  Please.  Everyone.  Besides, we use characters.  It's okay, because we use characters.  Now, when you...  Do you know any of the history of Richard Nixon?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's obviously a bit.  You know, he's not the most...  Wasn't the most racially sensitive person in the White House.  There are tapes and documentation and people that will attest to that. 
[00:46:00]  That he was always going around saying that.  And, you know, Ben worked for the man.  Right, right.  Just curious.  What are both of your guys' ethnic backgrounds?  I'm 100% German.  Okay.  I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ.  Who's speaking to him?  No, I'm not.  It's Anthony.  I'm Italian.  Okay.  We changed sides in the war when we saw who was losing.  I'm a mutt.  I'm an American mutt. 
[00:46:30]  Okay.  I'm a little of everything.  Hey, well, I appreciate you.  I got some German in there, some Polak, you know.  Is there anything you guys would like to add on this?  Did I mention Ben Stein is insane?  I think you did.  Okay.  That's all I want to really get across.  Now, Corey, are you going to be writing a little piece on this?  Yeah, I'll probably be doing it a bit.  Yeah?  Yep.  A little bit?  Cool.  Well, let us know because our listeners will pick up your fine publication there.  We'll send you a cool picture of me dressed in an SS uniform.  It's really snappy.  I'm sure we'd appreciate that over here. 
[00:47:00]  You know what?  I found the Ben Stein tape.  I think we can just play it going into commercials here.  Right now?  Yeah.  You got a radio?  Should I just stay on the line then?  Yeah, you can do that.  Okay.  Anything else you need, Corey?  No, that's it.  Okay.  Anything you or the fine people at Entertainment Weekly need in the future, don't hesitate to call.  Okay.  All right, Corey.  Thank you.  We'll play it right now.  Hold on.  Thanks.  Oh, my God.  I think I just hung myself out to draw.  Yeah, that'll be taken out of contact. 
[00:47:30]  I'm going to look like the biggest racist ever.  All right, listen.  We're going to play this later, but why don't we just do it, okay?  Get it out of the way.  For some reason, it's a huge controversy today, so let's get right into it.  Rick, where does this start?  Because I don't know where you picked this up.  Pretty much starts talking about you guys talking about the call that just happened.  So it's happening after the fact.  All right.  Oh, so this is after Ben Stein hung up on us.  Then we're like, I can't believe you hung up on us.  And then we replayed the commercial and Ben Stein hanging up on us. 
[00:48:00]  Okay.  Okay.  All right, that's good.  Let's go to break with this.  We'll be back in a little bit.  Corey, this is for you.  But right now, we've got to say hi to Ben Stein, Anthony.  Ben Stein.  Hey, Ben.  Hi, how are you?  Did I just hear you do an ad where you said somebody was going to chew down the price of a car?  No, he said chew down.  Oh, that's a lot different.  We wouldn't say chew down on a commercial.  We would say it during the show.  But not during a paid advertisement, Ben. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  And you being of Jewish background, I would take it, Ben.  Yeah, of course.  And if we were going to say something like that, we certainly wouldn't say it just before we talked to Ben Stein.  Talk to Ben Stein.  I see.  You sure fooled me.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start?  Well, I really think that's a jackass thing to do.  But we said chew down.  Well, it sounds just like chew down.  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean, come on.  That's a crappy thing to do.  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism. 
[00:49:00]  Well, it's a term that is used, chew, not chew.  I wouldn't have said chew down.  Chew down.  You know, you'd say like a beaver would go at a tree.  He would chew down the tree.  Well, it sounds just like chew down.  And anybody who's listening to it is going to know you're saying chew down with a tiny, tiny chain.  Oh, my God, Ben. 
[00:49:30]  Are you this insane?  Are you actually this insanely crazy that you're arguing over chew or chew down?  Hello, Ben?  I think he just hung up.  Ben Stein just hung up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  102.7.  WNEW.  Theater of the Mindless.  Ah, and if you were just tuning in, if you were just tuning in, we just made some asinine comments to Entertainment Weekly. 
[00:50:00]  I can't imagine it's going to be a positive article on you and I, Anthony, and Entertainment Weekly.  Yeah, yeah.  They've jumped onto the Ben Stein controversy, and we did a little interview.  Yeah, some guy emailed us and said, you don't think Entertainment Weekly is going to do a positive article on YouTube?  He sounded a little too pro-Ben Stein.  Well, no, we're not delusional.  Believe me.  And we don't care.  I think it would be pretty funny if they trashed us in Entertainment Weekly.  I think, as far as I'm concerned with this whole thing, it's very silly, yet entertaining. 
[00:50:30]  And as far as the issue goes of any anti-Semitism, I think the facts and the tapes and what I've said and what Ben Stein said speaks for itself.  I don't have to figure anything out.  Leave it up to people that heard it.  There you go.  This filter, by the way.  Richard Patrick's old bandmates, Nine Inch Nails, Anthony, coming to town next week for two shows, May 9th at the Garden, May 10th at the Coliseum, Nine Inch Nails. 
[00:51:00]  And we've got two fine shows to check out tonight.  Yes.  You've got the Mighty Mighty Boss Stones at the Bowery Ballroom and Oasis at Radio City Music Hall tonight.  Oh, really?  If you're lucky, maybe the brothers will get into a huge fight on stage.  Beat each other up.  That'll be good.  Hey, let me get the song, if you want to get into this a little bit.  Ah, yeah.  Oasis set.  Radio City Music Hall tonight. 
[00:51:30]  Play it right, you wanker.  I wonder if they'll be sober.  You never know.  Ah, man, this is a sad dance.  Just beating the crap out of each other while they play. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Okay, brother.  Ha, ha, ha.  While we were getting high.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Caught beneath the land slide.  In a champagne soup and over in the sky. 
[00:52:30]  What are you people?  All dope?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Caught beneath the land slide.  I'm in a champagne soup and over.  Are you my pal?  Ha, ha, ha.  He's got...  Ouch.  Yeah, yeah.  Ouch.  We don't have to do that for some reason.  Ouch.  But you get the idea.  You get the idea.  Yeah, they're not known for really getting along with each other.  Although you gotta get a lot of credit for actually sticking together. 
[00:53:00]  Hmm.  A lot of people, even though they can make a boatload of cash, they break up.  No, they need each other.  When they don't get along.  It helps their image, knowing at any moment they can beat the hell out of each other on stage.  Like the brothers from, uh...  I mean, it's no white lion, Anthony, but you know.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Shut up.  I didn't go there to see white lions, so shut up.  Uh, Sylvia has a question.  Sylvia, what's going on?  Hey, I wanted to see if you guys could, um, give me a little advice on how I can be an active listener to your show. 
[00:53:30]  We like, uh, active listeners.  Uh, basically to be an active listener, you gotta, uh, listen to the show a lot.  Um, and you gotta wow guys.  I don't know where to go to do that.  Uh, just hit the highways and byways.  Look for a guy's car that has a wow on it, and then show them your little hooters there.  All right?  All right.  Well, I...  We don't know what you're asking, really.  Well, because I've been trying for a while, and I just...  I just don't seem to find those guys with a wow on their car. 
[00:54:00]  Well, it, uh, the season has just begun, so...  What are you laughing at, Ant?  We're screwed.  Why?  All right, I gotta go.  Ant found something.  Uh...  What do you mean we're screwed?  Thank Keith from Manhattan for, uh, checking in with this one on Instant Feedback.  Corey from Entertainment Weekly is on the racism beat.  This is his last piece in the mag.  You're done for.  India Inc. by Corey.  I won't mention his letter.  Well, it's in the paper.  Takahashi.  Oh, no. 
[00:54:30]  This is the guy that just interviewed us for Entertainment Weekly.  India, uh, this is what he writes.  India, already at odds with Pakistan, has found a new enemy.  The Academy Awards.  After the Sixth Sense, directed by Indian-born, uh, M. Night, uh, Shyamalan...  What's his name?  Shyamalan.  Yeah.  Came away with nary a salute.  The subcontinent's media went, uh, into attack mode.  The Times of India cried cultural racism, while the Pioneer headlined an article,  and the Oscar goes to apartheid.  Dismissing Oscar-fave American Beauty as a fluffy film about Yankee suburbia. 
[00:55:00]  Well, he didn't write, uh, all these quotes.  He just was commenting on how, uh, India was reacting to the Academy Awards.  Mm, let's see.  Well, it's not racism.  Yeah, he was just commenting on what India said.  But I guess that is, uh, like his forte in the magazine?  Something like that?  Well, we'll have to...  I'm sure he'll be, uh, uh, fair and impartial, as a reporter should be.  Yeah, that'll happen. 
[00:55:30]  What?  Is that the real Dice calling us in?  Calling in today?  I don't know.  Let's hear you.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello?  Dice?  Yeah.  Hey, Dice.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  You're on the air.  What's up?  How come I hardly hear you?  Ah, goddamn.  We hear you.  The phone's phone.  What's wrong with your phone?  It's your phone.  Push some buttons.  What's going on?  You have nothing to do today?  You had a call?  Where are you?  You don't think it's me?  It is definitely.  No, it's you.  No, you want to know the truth why I'm calling in? 
[00:56:00]  Why?  I know it's going to sound crazy to you.  Yeah.  But I had, uh, such a good time talking to you guys last week.  Yeah.  And I had to call you and just tell you, because it was such a jolt.  You know, like when I called in, I thought I'd just call in, happy birthday, you know,  to Bo.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But you guys were so terrific, and it became so much fun, it, like, made me want to do stuff 
[00:56:30]  again.  I'm telling you the truth.  And I wanted to call you and tell you.  I mean, that's what you did.  That's what, like, you got me, like, crazy.  Really?  You're like the soft, sensitive dice here.  No, no, I'm not being soft, sensitive.  I mean, that's a side to me, that is.  It was like, I was thinking about it all.  I mean, I got on stage every night after that.  Yeah.  You know, because there's been certain things going on that I didn't feel like doing.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, there's this, uh, you got to understand, and you'll see what I'm talking about, like 
[00:57:00]  with, uh, Anthony, like, you know, I was goofing on the, um, you know, the, uh, you  know, the whole divorce situation.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But don't think I don't feel bad for you also.  I wanted you to know that.  Oh, nice.  Thank you.  No, because I know what somebody goes through.  I've been down that road.  Yeah.  Well, we're, nah, we know you were joking with us.  No, I know, and it's a lot of fun, and I love destroying people and ripping people to  shreds.  You know, and I think, you know, and it brings, you know, like, when we talk about your misery. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's fun.  It's fun for everyone else.  She's basically in the dungeon now.  Right.  You know, and then, you know, we could all laugh about it, but then you're in a courtroom,  and she's taking every penny you're going to make for the next 20 years.  Hey, was that you in the back bench?  Was that you on the back bench?  It's fun for me, because I'm thinking, hey, boy, I'm glad I'm not him.  You know what I mean?  Well, you're making me feel better already, Dice. 
[00:58:00]  You know what I mean?  But I've been down that road.  Right.  You know, when you get your heart ripped out, and then, you know, you go home from after  being on the radio show, and now you're sitting there all along going, I hate me.  I hate the life I'm leading.  I'm on the radio every day making people laugh.  In the meantime, you're getting your heart torn out, because of the black midget wrestling.  But I also understand that end of it. 
[00:58:30]  Well, Dice, I'm doing it.  But on the other end, you know, that's what you've got to do to make people laugh.  Right.  You know what I mean?  But it's not all doom and gloom.  I mean, I'm doing it right for myself.  But I actually called in on a day I wasn't feeling too great about me.  You weren't?  Dice.  No, and everybody knows those days.  What was going on?  Dice, let me interrupt you really fast and just say that your call last week on the radio  was one of the best things we've done since moving back to New York.  Really?  The feedback, the email, the phone calls after you hung up was unbelievable. 
[00:59:00]  You're a funny son of a bitch.  Everybody wants to hear that segment again.  I love doing comedy.  But that particular day, it's like I got this thing, you know, I've really, you know, I've  really, you know, I've been working on like a new, like two hours of material.  And like I told you, I've been playing, you know, just the Venetian in Vegas.  Vegas.  And from what I heard, I don't want to go, you know, I know what it is when I put something  out.  And I know what I have to absorb. 
[00:59:30]  Dice, is it true you're one of the highest, you are the highest paid comic in Vegas?  Yeah.  All right.  I heard that.  That's not the point.  You know, everybody knows what I've done.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  I create a history in a lot of ways that, you know, I get comics coming over to me all  the time going, the only reason I became a comic is because of you.  You know, and that's a good feeling.  Right.  But I know when I put something out, you know, what I'm going to have to deal with as far  as media and, you know, the women's groups. 
[01:00:00]  You've got to deal with everything that you've been dealing with for many years.  Yeah.  I've been dealing with it for a long time.  So, you know, a couple of weeks ago, you've heard of like EMI Capital, you know.  Sure.  Yeah.  So they want to do this, you know, they see me working and they go, if we put an album  out with you, this thing is going to sell 8 million copies.  All right.  And I was at the point where I was like, you know what?  I don't need it.  I don't need that pressure on my back anymore.  Right.  You know what I mean?  But after I like spoke to you, the next day I called my manager. 
[01:00:30]  I said, you know what?  Make the deal.  Screw everything.  Let's put this thing through the roof and just shut everybody's mouth once and for all.  Yeah.  Look at that.  You know what I mean?  That's how I felt on the radio, especially once like Jay Moore called in.  Yeah.  You know, because he was a lot of fun, that guy.  Oh, without a doubt.  You know what I mean?  He's, you know, he's pretty funny.  The Jay Dice thing was so frigging funny to listen back to, man.  Everybody wants to hear it again.  We're going to have to replay it the next time we're going to get going on.  And then Corb Zordaketti was telling me he wanted to, you know, afterwards, he goes, 
[01:01:00]  don't you know who this Jay Moore is?  Because I wasn't sure who he was.  Yeah.  You know, he goes, that's the guy I told you wanted to break your records at Rascals.  See, even that made me feel good because here's another comic I really don't know,  and he wants to break the records I've done.  Right.  Which is impossible.  Impossible.  We did sell out like 10 shows for Jay Moore.  10 shows is nothing.  We would do 10 shows a week.  You know, it's Rascals.  It's 400 seats.  That's nothing. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, there you go.  You know, it's a great club.  It's probably the best club in the, you know, the whole area of Jersey over there.  But, you know, but what I'm saying is the point that he wants to break those records  Right.  says something to me.  It's like, you know what?  Get up, bang out another album, do another special, and tour the world.  So you're doing it.  That's the gift I was given.  So you're going to tour, you're going to get your ass to New York and get on this show live.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, I'm thinking about, like, even when you were on the radio.  Yeah.  You know, like all the people riding around that are coming from jobs. 
[01:02:00]  You know how they say, no matter what you do for a living, you hate your job.  Right.  Sometimes even a comic hates getting on stage and making other people laugh, but that's  the job.  Right.  I mean, most of the time I feel good when I've got to go on stage, but there are those nights  where you go, I'm just not into it.  But yet, once you're up there, hey, those people are paying money.  Those people want to laugh.  And those are the people that are running the whole world.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  You know, a guy taking, you know, the $2 at the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel is not exactly 
[01:02:30]  thrilled when he leaves the house going, oh, what a day I'm going to have.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  I get to take that.  I'm the toll taker.  You know what I mean?  Boy, I'm excited about this.  So he does the job.  Right.  He gets up, he goes, he does it.  Hey, Dice, are you having a nervous breakdown or something?  No.  I'm just telling you that you guys gave me like a surge of energy.  All right.  A little incentive.  So, Dice, we gave you a gift. 
[01:03:00]  Are you going to give us a gift in return?  Well, that's what I'm doing.  I'm telling you.  So I called up the next day.  I said, you know what?  Make the deal for the album.  Let's put the album out.  And let's make people go ballistic from this thing.  Well, that's not a gift.  Because I know the material I've been doing lately.  Yeah.  And I watch HBO and, you know, all those cable shows and all these comics.  Yeah.  And I go, you know, it's almost not fair to people to put this garbage in front of them.  You know what I mean?  Especially the ones trying to be filthy.  To be a dirty, filthy animal is something you've got to practice day in and day out. 
[01:03:30]  Sure.  You know what I mean?  I hear you, Dice.  Dice, Mark's on the line.  He says this isn't the suicide prevention hotline.  You might have mis-dialed.  What are you talking about?  This guy, Mark, he said he wants...  Hold on.  You can talk to him yourself.  Hold on.  Ah, Mark.  Hey, Dice, what are you doing?  What's happening here?  Stop drinking, you son of a gun, you.  What are you talking about?  What?  It sounds like this is a suicide prevention hotline.  What's going on?  So what's your problem?  Talk to me.  I can help you. 
[01:04:00]  You need the help, buddy.  What are you talking about?  Hey, how about some drugs, eh?  Wait a minute.  Oh, excuse me.  I didn't know you were the boss of me.  You've got to give me a sweet drink.  The whole point of this call was that I was, like, feeling bad.  All right, hold on.  Get out of here.  Let me get rid of him.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Dice.  All right, Dice.  Who was that?  I got rid of him.  Go ahead.  Unbelievable.  So now you're inspired.  You're going to put out...  Exactly.  That's what you guys did.  God, we can't even...  I haven't had that much fun in a long time.  We can't even inspire ourselves. 
[01:04:30]  I don't know how we did that for you.  You inspired me being filthy.  Being filthy.  You understand?  I understand.  It's like I was so excited the other morning I woke up, right?  I'm crazy over here.  Shut your mouth when I talk.  Did you wake up and up?  I woke up the other morning.  I start like...  You know, you used to know, because you were married.  Yeah.  So I'm banging the wife, right?  I mean, really banging her.  You know, like, when you're married, some of the lust goes out. 
[01:05:00]  Who's dying?  You know what I mean?  Listen to me.  You know how some of that, like, lust goes out?  Sure, sure.  You know what I mean?  But I mean, after I spoke to you guys, I mean, I'm whirling away with a freaking jackhammer.  Bouncing across the walls, throwing her up in the air, spinning her around.  She falls right on my peg.  You know what I'm saying?  All of a sudden, the alarm goes, so she wakes up and kills the whole thing.  I just want to ask.  You weren't...  That was a joke.  Go free.  I'm over here now. 
[01:05:30]  Go free.  I just want to ask.  You didn't have, like, an image of Anna or myself in your brain while you were doing your wife.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  All right.  The last thing I think about.  I just needed that.  The only time I think about you was when I talked to you.  Okay.  What about the banana juice?  Was that flowing nicely?  There was banana juice all over the room.  Yeah, okay.  There were people that, you know, in L.A., they were in cars.  They could just slide to work now after what I did.  Well, this is a great little phone call.  Well, I just wanted to tell you, because, like, you know, I got a call from a comic the other 
[01:06:00]  day.  This is another comic.  You know, because comedians are normally, you know, miserable.  Sure.  You know, you're a comic.  You know what I'm talking about.  Sure.  You do a voice or two.  Occasionally.  Occasionally.  Occasionally.  So this guy calls me up.  He goes, Dice, do you ever just feel doom?  You know?  Doom?  It happens to a comic.  He does, like, a great set, comes on stage, and then he wants to call your friend Mark.  Dice, it sounds to me like you might have some anxiety issues. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, I do.  I go through that a lot.  You get the anxiety attacks?  Yeah.  You want to know something?  You know Club Soda, Kenny.  Sure.  You know, Happy Face, you met him, he was up there with me.  Yeah.  That by the time I go on stage in Vegas, these guys have just had it with me.  Really?  Yeah.  Because all that, like, we go to the gym, right?  Because, you know, the new nickname for me is The Body.  Oh, Dice, The Body.  Yeah, The Body.  You know what I'm talking about. 
[01:07:00]  Well, I saw the E! True Hollywood story, and you on that Stairmaster looked pretty good  there, Dice.  No, no, no, no.  The home video of what?  A while ago.  You on the Stairmaster.  Right.  Forget about that.  I'm physically fit.  Okay.  Forget that.  I smoke on the treadmill.  Nothing bothers me.  But the point is, so we do this workout.  It's a very intense workout, right?  Right.  Every day.  You know, you're talking like 30 sets of weights.  You're talking 1,000 sit-ups.  You're talking 40 minutes on the treadmill.  Really work.  And then a half hour after that, it's like, what's this pain? 
[01:07:30]  What's this pain?  Why is my neck bothering me?  Why is my back?  That by the time I'm going on stage, these guys are just like thrilled to get rid of me  for the hour and a half.  Maybe you're working out too hard.  No, no.  But they go, Andrew, you're not getting a heart attack.  Nothing's going on here.  Oh, because you got a little hypochondria, too.  You climb friggin' mountains in L.A., and all you got to do is go on and insult people  in the front row.  So is that what it is? 
[01:08:00]  You get a little hypochondria, too?  Yeah, you get a hypochondria.  I got a brain tumor over here.  You know, you get the hypochondriac, the panic attacks, the anxiety, and then you go  on, and you curse some filthy animal in the front row out, and you feel better.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It sounds to me like the dice is a little deeper than everyone thinks.  He goes home at night, starts thinking about some of this crap, and works himself up  into a tizzy.  Yeah, exactly.  You go through that?  Yeah, I used to.  With this whole divorce thing, what are you going through? 
[01:08:30]  No, nothing.  Like, you know, something years ago.  Don't lie to me.  Guys, I swear, it's in first gear right now, this divorce thing.  When it reaches fourth gear, I'll talk to you.  No, but like, when was the actual split up?  Eh, like, what, fall?  In the fall?  Yeah.  Now, was this the type of thing where you didn't catch it, did you?  No, no.  I want it out, Dice.  Oh, you want it out?  Yeah.  So what am I trying to help you for?  I don't know.  I'm fine.  I was, like, feeling bad for you.  That's what we were trying to tell you. 
[01:09:00]  I thought you had, like, an affair or something with the midget.  No, there was no midget, Dice.  So who's the black midget wrestler?  I'm dating the black midget wrestler.  So you put a scam on me?  Thanks, I explain.  I'm walking around feeling bad, telling my wife, I'm on the phone with Opiate Anthony,  and his wife went with this, so he told me, like, this black midget wrestler.  You know, and, you know, it's a big joke to everybody listening, but the guy's probably  feeling bad about it. 
[01:09:30]  No, no, that ain't the way it happened.  But I understand what you're talking about.  Years ago, I went through a time where I didn't know why, but I was getting these anxiety attacks.  And it was right.  So what did you do?  I don't know.  It just kind of stopped it.  You started going with the black midget wrestler.  That'll cure anything that ails you, Dice.  No, it just kind of, I think I finally just said, hey, screw this, man.  You know, if it had...  But if you went with the midget, right, or whoever it was, what, you missing a leg? 
[01:10:00]  No, I...  I didn't turn it a little off.  She was missing something, right?  To be honest with you, no.  It wasn't a midget.  It wasn't a black midget or anything like that.  I'm doing...  You don't got nothing against black midgets, do you?  Everything.  I would love to do a black midget.  You like those fingers that look like Vienna sausages?  You want that touching you?  Yeah, a midget wrestler's two inches too short to whack the bag anyway.  It's a punishment being a midget.  Little bow leg.  Did you ever think about that?  What, a punishment being a midget? 
[01:10:30]  You know what, think about it.  If it wasn't a punishment, you know how everybody says they want to be reincarnated?  Right.  Well, you know, not everybody's so good.  You know what I mean?  Like O.J. will come back as a midget.  A midget.  Jeffrey Domino will be a midget.  Hitler will be a friggin' midget.  So you know what God says?  He goes, all right, this is what I do for you.  Look at me now.  I give you a little Tonka toy party, and I snap on a 78-pound friggin' head.  Hey, go back.  Here's a little knife.  You could cut people's shins, O.J.  Get out of here.  You know, and your arms are going to be two inches too short to whack the bag. 
[01:11:00]  Come on.  Could you imagine not being able to pull out the bucket, the banana juice?  You want to talk about a punishment?  You've got to put that on your new album.  You want to know something?  I'm not the kind of guy that just masturbates.  Yeah.  I come up with waves.  I make it exciting.  I lay on my arm for a half hour until it's dead like a piece of meat, and it's almost like  a strange chick doing it to you.  Sure.  I've tried that one. 
[01:11:30]  That's pretty cool.  I mean, think about it.  The whole midget situation.  Yeah.  It's the first thing you do when you wake up and your arm is asleep.  I'm going to touch myself.  Exactly.  That's how my mind works.  Because we're all a bunch of filthy animals.  In my mind, could you imagine being a kid and having parents that are midgets?  Think about that.  Because, you know, I studied the whole midget phonology, and they could grow real people.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Imagine you're 12 years old.  You're like 7'2".  Your parents are midgets. 
[01:12:00]  You'll move the house.  What are we talking about over here?  I'm over here now.  What do you think?  You're going to wait until you're 16 to take the car?  You tell your father, hey, pop, jump out of the heights here.  I want to talk to you a minute now.  Give me the keys to the car.  And this little four-foot-two idiot is like, oh, I don't think it's a good idea.  Oh, you don't?  How about I take all the food from the fridge, stick it in the freezer.  I'll starve you to death, you little hard-on.  Get out of here.  Go ride the dog around the house.  Oh, my God.  I'm telling you something. 
[01:12:30]  I studied it.  My friend tells me.  Dice, you are born again.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  You have a new life here.  You have a new outlook on it.  I don't know, but I think about these things.  Nobody's thinking about midgets.  How about a thank you on the new album?  Yeah, all right.  I'll give you a thank you.  All right, good.  That's a nice thing.  You're inspiring it because you went with the little black midget like this wrestler.  Do you know what I mean?  Well, you know, I'm just thinking about, like, you know, how nobody wakes up in the morning 
[01:13:00]  thinking, how can I help a midget today?  What can I do personally to make the life of it?  And you never see them during the day.  By throwing them a bang.  You know, but where do you see midgets hanging out?  Nah, I think a science would put an engine in it.  When a midget comes over, can I help you with a new suit?  Never.  Let me stand on you to reach that shirt.  Come on.  Never.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now because you said.  All right, guys.  You sure? 
[01:13:30]  I don't know.  What were you doing before I called?  Anything?  Yeah, some good stuff.  We had a problem with Ben Stein from Comedy Central.  Yeah, Ben Stein hung up on us Friday.  Oh, he said, oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben Stein.  We were doing Comedy Central a favor.  We said, all right, we'll give Ben Stein five minutes.  I'll tell you something.  You had a guy.  And Kenny, Club Solo Kenny was telling me, after I hung up, you see what I mean?  How there's always a problem with these humps?  You had some other comic on. 
[01:14:00]  What was that?  That Jim Norton told me.  Number one, the guy's not funny and he can't act.  And he said he had a problem with me.  He said his name.  Oh, oh, oh.  Lewis.  Lewis Black.  Yeah.  And I'm going, I never even heard of this guy.  You know what I mean?  Well, apparently he was on some radio show and you were ripping into him.  Believe me, if I ripped into him and never met, there had to be a reason.  He had a stink.  Well, he's coming in Thursday if you want to call back.  He's coming.  Yeah.  I'll write it down on my schedule. 
[01:14:30]  He's coming in.  You know, what do I, what do I, going to destroy his life again?  Wow, we can't say anything because Club Solo Kenny.  But the guy was horrible.  He was absolutely horrible.  Club Solo Kenny tells you everything, huh?  Yeah, because this is a guy, you know, comes on your radio show.  We just did like two hours of having a great time and wants to open his mouth about me.  A guy I never even met trying to get some like credibility that he even spoke to me.  You know what I mean?  You talk to the legend. 
[01:15:00]  Believe me, you know it.  Yeah, I told all my friends I talked to the legend.  What happened?  I talked to everyone that I talked to Dice.  How come Opie hardly ever talks?  Because I'm scared of you.  Why don't you get rid of him?  I don't know.  He's intimidated by your dice.  No, Opie's a good guy.  I like him.  It's just a name.  Fama.  Hey, Fama.  Fama.  You know, I keep telling him, Looms didn't, maybe it's a hook name.  I don't know.  It's silly.  It's too late now.  Did your parents name you that or is that something you picked for the radio?  No, my name's Greg.  Is it really? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I never liked that name either.  When he was a kid, he looked like Opie from...  But Greg's got an attitude to it.  Ah, not really.  You know, Opie's like, you know, you guys are jugglers.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you're right about that.  If you don't want to work on Anthony, he's got to do me all day.  No, we don't...  You know what I mean?  Can't do Chris Walken.  No.  Well, Jay Moore does Chris Walken.  I've been practicing Chris Walken, going into a club.  Let me hear.  I don't know if it's that good.  Uh-oh.  Let me hear.  So you've got to say...  Here we go.  So I say to you, I'm going to say, uh, are there babes? 
[01:16:00]  And then you say, yeah.  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Let me get into Chris Walken mode.  Okay.  Are there babes?  Yeah.  Then let me in.  Sounds like Dice Walken.  Let me try it again.  Let me get more into it.  Are there babes?  Wait a minute.  Now it's more like that.  What are your lines?  No, it's more like that.  Let's try it again.  All right.  Let's try it again.  What are you babes? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Wait.  Let me try it different.  All right.  Let's go.  Are there little lick it up, filthy little swaps?  Oh, that's Walken.  Yeah.  That's perfect now.  That's perfect now.  All right.  So you've got to do your line.  Yeah.  Are there little...  No, not yet.  Did I say no?  What are we playing?  Simple Simon?  You want to get into acting one day?  You do it.  I tell you to do it.  I tell you to do it.  And that's that because I'm over here.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  We hear you.  Are there little midget babes?  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Then let me in.  What's that?  That was pretty good.  You almost had a Gleason thing at the end.  I didn't do anybody.  Then let me in.  All I used to do was impressions.  Here, remember Ed Sullivan?  Sure.  Hey, we got a great friggin' show for you this evening.  We got a Toto G. Joe, the old Puerto Rican mouse, running around doing this side and  the other friggin' thing.  I can do anybody.  What do you like?  That's pretty good.  Nice.  Do Humphrey Bogart.  Humphrey Bogart? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  What do you mean like doing?  What do you think?  I'm like a faggotito.  You understand what I'm saying?  Who wants to hear Humphrey Bogart?  All right.  I was just...  Who the hell was I?  I mean, Humphrey Bogart's like, what 18-year-old driving home now is thinking, oh, boy, would  I love to hear Dice do Humphrey Bogart?  No, but they all know Ed Sullivan and Topo G. Joe.  You've got a problem.  What about they all know Ed Sullivan and Topo G. Joe, though, Dice?  But they've been rerunning Ed Sullivan, my friend.  All right.  Do Travolta. 
[01:18:00]  Do Travolta.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Let me get into it now.  All right.  Dice doing Travolta.  Listen to this.  You're going to die.  I swear you're going to crack up, right?  It's like the other day, Mr. Carter says to me, he says, Vinny, did you do your homework?  What?  You say I do it perfect.  Yeah, that's pretty good, Dice.  I'll give you that one.  Wow.  Who else could you do?  I'm a loving, plenty of sloppy pigs.  You know, that kind of stuff. 
[01:18:30]  Well, what he must have done to that Olivia Newton-John, I'd have to get in there if I worked  with her.  I don't know.  She looked pretty skinny and gross.  Oh, please.  You put them black tights down the way she had them.  Yeah.  You get behind her with your hairy banana.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  Everybody goes home a winner with me.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  Don't you have to pick up your kid or something?  You know what gets me crazy?  Why?  You know when you're having sex? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  You know when you have your orgasm?  Yeah.  Sure.  The sound that comes out of your banana.  What?  That drives me nuts, that whistling sound.  What the hell are you talking about?  What do you mean what am I talking about?  You better go see a doctor.  You know the sound better than me.  You better see a doctor.  Yeah, you're getting whistling sounds.  What are you talking about?  What, do you got a piercing down there or something?  No, it's like this whistling sound that follows it.  I don't know what the hell you...  It's a screech.  Maybe that's the girl.  I don't know what you're talking about.  No, that's not the girl.  They're normally sleeping. 
[01:19:30]  A screech?  I never heard anything come out of my banana.  I don't know what you're talking about.  What happened now?  You were on such a roll, too.  Well, that's right.  You're a madman type.  How long am I going to talk about midgets?  I bet you got every midget in the metropolitan area listening now, though.  Well, what's the problem with us now?  I think we're...  They're not doing concerts in New York.  You know, they'll surround Carnegie Hall with midgets.  At least, yeah, there aren't too many of them.  They're getting midgets.  We have a midget coming in next week.  You know what? 
[01:20:00]  Maybe they'll double up, put on a long black coat like the Hasidics.  Yeah.  And act like real people.  We have a midget whore coming in next week.  Yeah, well, that sounds real exciting.  She does porno.  You know what I mean?  You can stick them on your pegs, shave, shower.  They don't get in the way.  You throw them in a drawer when you're done with them.  Yeah, fix my T-shirts.  I'll be back in an hour, honey.  What does a midget do for work?  What, do you put them on a broom handle to hit those hard-to-clean places?  Come on.  I don't know.  Hey, Billy wants you to do corn on the cob. 
[01:20:30]  What?  Does that mean...  Billy?  Who's Billy?  I don't know.  Some guy.  He goes, have Dice do corn on the cob.  Well, the thing with corn...  Did you ever notice that after you eat it, even if it comes out like three days later,  it like puts itself back together.  It's like a magical, you know, what is it?  It's a food.  It's a steak with protein.  I don't know what it is.  Corn has like its own life. 
[01:21:00]  You know what I mean?  And when I eat corn, I make sure to chew it.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Because then I'm just amazed of what it can do on its own.  Sometimes it actually comes out on the cob again.  You know what I'm saying?  You got some chicks up there today.  What's going on?  No, we don't have any girls in here today.  No.  Who's that one that you were hanging with, Opie?  That's Sandy.  Who's that?  Sandy, my girlfriend.  Oh, Sandy.  Oh, filthy animal. 
[01:21:30]  She loves when you talk dirty to her.  Did you ever say that to a girl in bed?  Uh, yeah.  Filthy animal?  You don't love that kind of romantic talk.  That's the thing, Anthony.  If you're going to get serious with somebody,  and you get in bed with them,  you've got to be yourself.  Don't play no games.  Oh, I usually do dice.  No, forget about doing dice.  That's a good one.  It's like, I'm going to bang that ass, honey.  I'm going to bang that big, fat, frumpy, dumpy,  dimple with a banana-filled dice.  And I like them a little older, you know what I mean? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  You know, where it's like,  where it's got like 100,000 miles of banana on it already.  You know, all bent it up.  The front end's a little lopsided.  Sure.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm over here.  Looks like she's been sitting in the gravel driveway too long.  You know, I'm good like that.  Yeah, okay.  And I like aunt.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's why after I unload the mule juice all over,  I normally take a picture and I frame it for people to look at in my living room. 
[01:22:30]  It's beautiful.  They go, look at that.  Look what he did again.  That's what you got to say after you're in bed with a chick.  And each one's different.  Just after you're completely done and you're sweating, you know,  you just look over at her belly and go, look what I did to you again.  I always say again.  It's very important.  Again.  I'm writing all this stuff down, Doug.  So this way, when you break up, 
[01:23:00]  you know how many times I said again to you?  You know, and then she's got to move on to the next guy,  these stupid animals.  They wanted to have jobs.  They didn't know when it was good for them.  Sure.  Hey, Dyson, is your wife going home?  I'm watching soap operas, drink coffee,  and wait for me to come home with the banana swinging out of my pants.  You know what I mean?  No, they wanted to work.  And then at 35 years old,  they don't feel like getting up in the snow anymore  and cleaning the ice off the windshield 
[01:23:30]  and heating up the car.  It's not so much fun to be a career woman then.  Living on your own.  Yeah, okay, big shot.  You are off, man.  Your ass is hanging down to your knees.  And nobody's looking at you.  Okay?  You were 20 years old.  You thought you were a big shot.  Now look at you now.  That's what I say.  Holy smart, Dyson.  You know what I mean?  Jesus Christ.  You know what really gets me crazy?  What?  You know that we're living like, 
[01:24:00]  you know, everybody's going,  you know, I got my home office?  Yeah.  That's what makes women smarter than men.  You see,  the only time men were able to get away  from these nitwits they marry  is in the morning when they,  you know,  you make believe you don't want to go to work.  Oh, honey, it's cold.  I don't want to go.  Oh, see you later.  Then the minute you get in the car,  you're blasting the radio.  You're looking at all these,  these,  these,  these big busted filthy animals  with the cars next to you. 
[01:24:30]  Then you get to work, right?  Yeah.  And the first thing you see  is the receptionist  with a little pigtails,  with the red blouse half open,  and those big McGuffys hanging out.  And all the guy is thinking is,  boy,  would I love to get this idiot  in the pencil room.  You know what I mean?  Boy,  would I like to sit that fat ass  on the copy machine  as she's screaming,  more banana,  more banana,  as your yam bag is smacking 
[01:25:00]  against the rails  and you're taking pictures of it.  That's all the guy is thinking,  no matter what she's saying.  No, no,  I'm the problem.  I'm the bad guy, right?  You're a yam bag.  I'm making all this up.  Jesus Christ,  you're killing me,  don't you?  You're a yam bag.  You're a yam bag.  That's like the normal terminal.  I gotta come up with like,  when I call you guys,  I gotta like,  things on my face.  A yam bag,  I love it.  A yam bag,  mayonnaise bag,  mule bag,  whatever you want to call it. 
[01:25:30]  We use banana sack.  We use banana juice  all the time now,  because you're,  thank you.  You can't,  you can't,  you can't.  I knew that would piss you off.  You know what I mean?  We give you the credit.  Hey.  But instead of being able  to go to work  and do that  and come home  eight o'clock at night,  no,  it's like,  honey,  I'm going into my room now.  I'm going into my room  all alone  that this  moron you live with  is coming in like,  on like the hour.  How is it going? 
[01:26:00]  You're not hanging out  with the guys in the park  looking at all these animals,  these smelling good animals.  You're in a room  walking around,  oh yeah,  I'm on my lunch break.  There's a bird on the roof.  I'm feeding that now.  That's what everybody wanted.  That's how dumb,  that's how dumb we are.  Oh my God.  We're not going to work,  having an affair on the side,  which is the,  the only reason to get married  is to have an affair.  You know,  in my, 
[01:26:30]  I mean,  you can't have one  without it.  You know what I mean?  It's not having an affair  unless you marry.  Yeah,  exactly.  That's the beauty of it.  If you're just banging some chick,  you know,  and you tell your friend,  yeah,  so what,  I'm banging a chick too.  But if you know  you've got somebody at home  that you're going to make miserable  by the end of this thing,  you know,  then there's a challenge  that brings excitement  into the marriage.  Oh,  I'm,  you know,  like,  you know,  you can say,  why did you bang her?  It was an accident. 
[01:27:00]  I'm sorry.  You know what I mean?  What do you want from me?  Monogamy.  I'd harass with it.  God damn dice.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm having an affair.  You know,  what'd you do?  You know,  when we were in a room,  everybody felt awkward.  And the minute I hopped on her,  you know,  everything loosened up.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  Yeah,  but then I tell her,  I'm over here now.  Can we,  can we put this out on CD for you? 
[01:27:30]  No.  Don't do me no favor.  Don't go into a recording studio.  Just get the tape from us  from your last two appearances.  Yeah,  I guess I said to my wife,  because it's very hot out now right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I said,  you know,  you know,  it's hot.  You know,  she wants to lay in the sun  and I'd rather,  you know,  get just between her legs or something.  So I said,  you know,  let's go in and have some bang,  you know,  and she said,  I'm not in the mood.  I go,  there are no choices here.  That's what marriage is all about.  This is not a choice.  I'm not asking.  Come on. 
[01:28:00]  And then once you get them going,  they always get in the mood anyway.  You know,  you might have to rip a piece of clothing off or something,  but that turns them on sometimes.  You know what I mean?  I hear you,  Dice.  You got some stuff in your head,  guys.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You're killing me.  That's what I think.  I don't know.  That's some good thinking.  Lots of people checking in on instant feedback.  Dice is killing me.  What's instant feedback?  Well,  we get this instant feedback on the,  on the computer.  Oh yeah.  Not a computer idiot. 
[01:28:30]  Computer idiot.  It's a simple thing.  It's called like email.  I don't know about these things.  You got to get online,  Dice.  From a century.  You got to get online,  Dice.  I'm not in this century,  my friend.  Some of the best porno.  I just want to go out,  smoke,  throw a few drinks back.  I don't have to type in,  you know,  masturbation to some chicken Beijing.  You know what I mean?  I get on a hardwire phone.  Oh,  I didn't know this was the wrong number.  What's your name,  honey?  20 minutes later. 
[01:29:00]  I'll give you a call another time.  Click.  Local calls.  Local.  Local always.  We are so late,  Dice.  You got to take a break.  Well,  I just,  like I said,  I want to call in.  I want to tell you,  everything will work out for you.  Thank you,  Dice.  And you gave me a lot of incentive,  and I'm going to put this album out now.  Do that.  And when you do,  you got to get over here and come on the show live.  I need a good title for the album.  So maybe you guys could help out with that.  I'm over here now.  Jerk off. 
[01:29:30]  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Jerk off.  I'm over here now.  What do you mean you're over there?  Jerk off face.  I'm over here now.  Call it Jerk off face.  Maybe I'm over here now.  You think that's a good name for you?  I'm over here now.  Yeah,  good for you.  Good for you.  You came up with a name in two seconds.  And banana juice.  So if I call it,  I'm over here now.  I've got to give you a special thanks.  No.  Well,  yeah,  a nice thank you on the inside.  It'd be nice.  Like what?  What would I write to you like?  I don't know.  Something like,  if you don't know,  that is the problem. 
[01:30:00]  That's why your life is in turmoil right now.  You're absolutely right.  What can I say?  I want to help you,  and all of a sudden,  you're like naming my album?  I name my album.  I'm over here,  and you're going to tell me what to do.  I'm the legend.  I'm the body.  Now I feel regretful  that I even made this heart so cool.  Wake up, Dice.  You know what I mean?  All right,  look.  I'm crazy over here now. 
[01:30:30]  I'm going to go.  You're over there now.  I'm over here  because everybody said what?  Thank you.  All right,  Dice.  That's what everybody says.  All right,  I'll talk to you later.  Keep in touch,  man.  All right.  There you go.  It's Andrew Dice Clay.  Holy Toledo.  That guy is a maniac.  A maniac.  Ann and Ope,  your therapist to the stars.  Yeah,  anybody else want to call and vent,  feel free.  Oh, my God.  Anyone else out there  who needs a push with their career, 
[01:31:00]  give us a call.  I'm glad he finished like he did  because it was starting like Corky Dice.  Right.  Yeah,  I just want to say,  hear what you two done for me.  You inspired me.  You inspired me to put the album out.  I thought he was going to do  the Arsenio appearance live.  Yeah.  That was pretty freaking cool.  That's funny stuff, man.  One lady was begging.  Oh, no,  a guy,  Dan.  He goes,  oh, wait,  let's put Dan on real fast.  Dan,  what's going on?  Hey,  how you doing?  What's up, man?  I'm glad he hung up 
[01:31:30]  because I'm still sitting in my van laughing.  Yeah.  I missed the dentist appointment last week  because I couldn't leave the vehicle.  Oh, cool.  I don't know.  This show brings something out of Dice.  What can I say?  Hey,  you guys inspired him.  I think it should be noted on his desk.  All right, Dan.  Cool.  All right,  take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  God damn,  that was funny, though.  Let's go to Laura.  We're so late.  We've got to take a break here.  Laura,  what's up?  I've just got to say,  I'm still laughing about these little midgets.  They can have real people, too?  Yeah.  I mean, 
[01:32:00]  I had to pull over.  Frigging yam bag killed me.  A yam bag.  I can't stop.  I had to pull over off the LIE.  I can't.  He's out of his frigging mind.  I love it.  Jay Moore's got some stiff competition,  I believe,  as number one guest on the O&A show.  Jason from River Edge, New Jersey,  checking in for Dice's album title.  Slap it with your yam bag.  All right, Laura.  Guys,  I've been listening to the show  ever since the beginning of time  with WNEW,  and I just want to say,  first time got through, 
[01:32:30]  and syndication now.  All right,  thank you.  Thanks.  There she goes, Laura.  Thanks, man.  Anthony,  let's take a break.  We've got to catch up.  Yeah.  You know,  Dice was doing all that midget stuff.  Yeah.  We've got to do midget town.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Check this out.  This is the story of six strangers  made to live together in the house  and have their lives taped.  Find out what happens  when they stop being polite  and start getting tiny.  Real world midget town.  Listen, Binky,  I don't like it when you talk down to me.  You belittle me. 
[01:33:00]  You make me feel two feet tall.  Well, I have some news for you, Chi Chi.  You are two feet tall.  Nishu used to work in a circus,  and he's all like,  oh,  I used to ride on a crony,  and I used to drive a wind-up Volkswagen,  and I'm like,  midget,  get over yourself.  I think the problem here  is that they're all a little jealous of me  because I come from the entertainment industry.  I was in the circus.  I don't know if I mentioned that to you,  and also for a number of years,  I played Snuggles,  the fabric softener bear. 
[01:33:30]  What you need to understand  is that going to Six Flags Great Adventure  is a waste.  We're dwarves.  We can't get on any of the friggin' rides.  Well, that's where you're wrong, Chi Chi,  because we can do a lot at Great Adventure.  We can get on that thing  that looks like a worm  that goes in a circle.  It's like a worm wearing a hat.  It's like a green plastic thing,  but it goes in a circle.  It goes up and down a little bit.  We can get on that.  We can get on the boats,  little boats.  You know those boats?  They go in a circle around  in a little pool of water there,  and they have bells on the front of them.  They have bells,  and if you pull on the string, 
[01:34:00]  you can ring the bell.  So,  so shut up.  Hey, what are you guys doing?  Um,  we were just going to go out  and throw rocks at people,  you know,  for staring at us.  That sounds good.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  Uh,  by the way,  I'm gay.  Whoa,  that really caught me off guard.  I didn't know he was gay,  because I thought I was gay,  but I really wasn't sure.  So when he said,  I'm gay,  I'm like,  put that together with being a midget.  I got enough on my plate here.  That's tonight  on Real World Midget Town.  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay,  and you're listening, 
[01:34:30]  no,  not Anthony Dice Clay,  Andrew Dice,  and you're listening to Opie  and the guy that wants to be me show  on WNEW 102.7.  The Opie and Anthony  from Boobies and Whore Shop.  By seven o'clock,  I think you're going to say,  you know what,  I had a pretty good time today.  1027 WNEW.  It's the ONA Show.  What a show we're having, 
[01:35:00]  huh, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  Out of nowhere,  Dice calls us.  Gives us some fabulous radio.  That was fun, man.  A lot of fun.  A little strange.  Dice calling us to thank us  that we have inspired him.  Get out there  and put out another album.  Start touring again.  All right,  I guess we got to go to the phones.  Oh, my God.  Does that mean  we're going to be responsible 
[01:35:30]  for whatever happens?  All right,  let's go to the phones.  Psycho Mark and Black Earl.  They're somewhere on Long Island.  They got lost.  Frig,  look at these two.  Pretty much every day  we're trying to get out there  with the brand new  wow stickers, Anthony.  Yeah.  A bunch of ways to get  the brand new wow stickers.  I mean, this week,  the weather's going to be perfect.  Wowing on Wednesday  is going to be absolutely great.  So either get yourself  one of the brand new wow stickers  or make a homemade wow sign 
[01:36:00]  because the ladies are ready.  The season has begun.  It's just going to get nuts  as we go on here, okay?  Oh, yeah.  You can go to participating,  keyword,  participating Ranch One locations  to pick up your wow sticker.  All you have to do  is ask the guy behind the counter,  hey, I'm here for a wow sticker  and he'll give you one, okay?  Or you can send in  a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Earl's in charge of that job, though, Anthony,  and the envelopes  are piling up awfully fast.  I saw that.  There's like crates of envelopes.  Crates,  like it's like a teeny bopper 
[01:36:30]  getting fan mail or something.  Well, it takes a while.  I have to open the envelope.  I must remove the contents  and then read it.  Wow.  And then respond.  Well, just send a self-addressed  stamped envelope.  Just write WNWWOW sticker  on there somewhere  and mail it in to 888 7th Avenue,  10th floor, New York, New York,  10106.  And that address should be  on the NWW website, okay?  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  Yeah, I know.  Ben's writing me a note.  You'll get your stickers in September.  Oh, boy.  All right, let's check in  with Psycho Mark and Earl.  They're lost somewhere on Long Island.  What's going on, guys?  You think he's got an envelope?  You should see his directions.  Yikes.  Where are you guys?  Dude, I could have got better directions  from a Chinese person  speaking full Mandarin.  You know what I mean?  Right.  I don't know.  We're actually,  we finally made it to Hofstra.  Thank God for some beautiful  police officer that helped us out.  What was his name?  I don't even remember his name.  I was so mad, I was screaming.  Beautiful police officer. 
[01:37:30]  Wait a minute.  Yeah, beautiful police officer.  You don't use the word.  He's a beautiful human being.  Oh, that was a joke.  I thought it was a chick cop  when you said beautiful,  and I was joking,  saying what was his name,  and it was a guy?  You're calling the cops beautiful?  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right, so where are you  with these WOW stickers today?  Well, right now,  we're checking out  the Hofstra softball team.  What a bunch of war pigs.  I'm so mad.  I'm about to do donuts  right in their lawn here.  No, what's so funny? 
[01:38:00]  Psycho Mark and Earl  obviously not from Long Island.  You picked a strange location  to give out WOW stickers today.  Ed and I, of course,  from Long Island.  I still live on Long Island.  Hempstead is a very strange area  there, Psycho Mark.  Yes.  Yeah, I heard it's kind of weird.  Well, you want to stay  within a certain radius  of the college campus.  Okay.  If you go outside  of the compound,  it gets a little dangerous.  It gets ugly real fast  over there, Psycho Mark.  What's that?  It gets ugly real fast. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, well, good thing  I have Earl with me.  He's the whitest black guy  in the whole world.  Oh.  All right.  So have you picked a location  where you're going to hang out  so people can stop by  and get their WOW stickers?  I think we're going to sit  right next to the entrance  of Hofstra University,  which is right off  the Hempstead Turnpike.  What is Earl saying?  Earl's babbling.  Earl, you be quiet  and sit there  like a good boy.  Okay?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to lose my mind.  These directions, 
[01:39:00]  I mean, we...  Whatever.  I'm losing my mind.  All right.  Some of our listeners  have found you.  They're beeping  a little bit out here.  We're going to go  right to the entrance  of Hofstra.  It's right at the front  of the campus here.  Right off  the Hempstead Turnpike.  Okay.  And we'll be right there.  We'll be handing out  WOW stickers.  So come on by  and come scream at Earl.  Okay.  Very good.  I'll be here myself.  Someone on the line  wants to know  when you're going to Jersey,  Psycho Mark.  When am I going to Jersey?  With the WOW stickers. 
[01:39:30]  You've got to do it  before the end of the week.  Yeah.  As soon as the station  buys a map,  maybe we can figure out  where we're going.  These guys left  like two and a half hours ago.  How about one of those  GPS devices?  You know,  so you've got  the Global Satellite.  You've got that in the van.  That's exactly what I need.  I'm right in front  of the Hofstra University  club.  They'll be real happy  to see me.  All right.  Nonetheless,  I'll be right here  in front of the entrance.  Come by.  We've got plenty  of WOW stickers.  All right.  Very good.  There they are.  Psycho Mark and Earl.  They're going to beat  each other up  by the end of the afternoon. 
[01:40:00]  Jennifer already wants  to know.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tell Stinky  to put Jennifer on hold.  All right.  Here we go.  Earl,  get out of the van  and hand out stickers.  Jennifer,  what's up?  I just wanted  to let you know  I was a student  at Hofstra  and if you hang out  at the front,  they're going to  kick you out?  Psycho Mark,  we've got an ex-Hofstra  student on the line.  She says they're  going to kick you out  if you hang out  at the entrance there.  What they should do  is just park  like if they were  a student  and cross over  like the spectra span 
[01:40:30]  that goes across  Amster Turnpike  and then it's like  the main area  and all the students  are there  so they can just  hang out there.  Where's all the cash?  What?  Psycho Mark's  also picking a location  where people  that don't go  to Hofstra  can stop  and grab  their stickers  as well.  Well,  I'm right here  off the highway.  You can't miss it.  It's really easy  to get to.  Well,  Psycho Mark,  give that location  again.  Good luck.  Thank you,  Jennifer.  Bye.  Right to the entrance  of Hofstra University  right off the  Hempstead Turnpike.  Pull right in.  I'm right here.  People are pulling up  left and right. 
[01:41:00]  We're going to  cause problems  here today.  All right.  Stay there  until they kick you out  and then we'll go  somewhere else  on Long Island.  Okay?  Very,  very good.  All right.  Call back  when you have  a problem  which will happen  soon.  Okay.  I'm sure.  All right.  There goes Psycho Mark.  Thank you,  bro.  Oh,  my God.  All right.  Trying to get  these stickers  out there,  Anthony.  Eddie,  what's going on?  Hey,  guys,  what's up?  Hey.  Why'd you put me  through?  You're not talking  about wrestling,  are you?  Well,  we might now.  It doesn't matter.  Anyway,  you guys saw  the pay-per-view,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What'd you think  of Stone Cold?  Well, 
[01:41:30]  it was kind of sad.  It was.  It was.  It really was depressing  to see him like that.  I mean,  everyone's expecting  the breaking glass sound.  His music starts up  and expecting him  to come out  like he was  when he was wrestling  months ago.  And he came out  all stiff,  looking like  Cardinal O'Connor.  Yeah,  he really looked horrible.  He's all like  overweight,  he's out of shape,  he's all stiff.  He came back too soon.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Judging by the looks of him,  he's not going to be  wrestling for a long time.  Not for a long time.  No,  he had trouble 
[01:42:00]  getting up off the mat.  He slams Vince  with a chair,  he goes down  on one knee,  he could barely  get back up.  Yeah,  he couldn't even  move like that thing  he does,  he gets on top of people,  it shakes his head  like he couldn't  even do that.  Yeah,  he couldn't do that.  He's just a mess.  It's sad,  you know,  we like the guy,  but he came back  too soon,  I think.  It didn't look good  for him.  No,  not at all.  He was filling out  that shirt a lot.  Oof.  On the internet,  they're saying  at least two more months,  at least.  Yeah.  I mean,  obviously,  you know,  recovery,  he can't work out, 
[01:42:30]  I guess.  I guess not.  Hard to stay in shape.  But the energy  he brings  when that music starts,  I mean,  no one is coming  close to what  he brings  to the WWE Rock.  I was thinking  about that,  though,  the Rock,  yes,  I mean,  the Rock gets  an incredible reaction,  but still stone cold  just over the top  every time that music plays.  Yeah,  Shane said it  the other day.  Yeah.  The electricity  when you're in the rain,  the glass breaks you.  But it was a good  pay-per-view  last night.  Oh,  it was.  Yeah.  Every match was good.  Cool.  Just about.  All right,  Eddie. 
[01:43:00]  All right,  Syndication Underground.  All right,  thank you.  I was just looking  at one of our  Syndication Underground  locations.  Yeah.  Oh,  we're not there anymore.  Oh,  really?  I'm looking at it,  let me say.  That's why we call it  Syndication Underground.  I mean,  something pops up,  then they get closed down,  we've got to go somewhere else.  It's all over the place.  Funk mix.  No,  no,  we're not there.  Yep,  various talk,  other,  nope,  gone.  Gone off of that one.  All right.  We're going to have to  find another one.  Oh,  that chick from California  used to listen off of this site. 
[01:43:30]  I know,  I wonder if we lost her.  That must suck.  Hey,  you had our show for like a week.  She's pretty savvy though.  If she's listening to us today,  give us a call.  She knows who she is.  We know her name and all,  okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Well,  we've got to take a quick break.  We're still trying to catch up  because Dice was unbelievable,  but he got us late here.  Yeah,  huh?  It's a really,  really,  I'm over here now.  It's a very quick commercial break,  I promise,  okay?  Yeah.  Just give us like three,  four minutes.  We'll be back.  Matter of fact,  as we go to break here,  Anthony,  it's me losing my mind on Friday.  The frigging caller 
[01:44:00]  just totally pissed off you off.  He wasn't paying attention  when we put the phone line down  and called his name.  His name?  He was listening to the radio,  which was on delay,  not listening to the phone  like all the callers should.  Most of them do.  You guys get it,  but every once in a while  we get an idiot  and it just blows your mind  that someone wouldn't answer  to their own name  on the phone  because they're waiting  for us to say hi  through the radio  when they're holding the phone  right up to their ear.  And 40 seconds later,  you'll hear us say hi  on the radio.  That's why it doesn't work. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  Turn down your radio.  So this is me losing my mind  on Friday.  We dumped out of this call  because I started cursing.  Check it out.  Steven.  Steven.  Or whoever your name is.  All right.  Please?  Yeah, well,  yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead, talk.  You.  Yeah, me.  Yeah, what's your name?  Steven.  Well, what?  You f***ing a**hole.  All I want to do  is defend. 
[01:45:00]  Number one,  I heard chew down  and I've heard chew down  for 40 years of my life.  Right.  How stupid do you have to be  to be on the phone  and someone calls your name  and you don't answer?  And you guys think  Spaz is stupid.  What do you,  who do you think  we were talking to?  Well, you said David  and I said my name is Steven.  No, we said Steven.  Do we have to play  that take back too?  I apologize. 
[01:45:30]  Let me just get to the point.  You call a radio show.  Holy s**t.  Holy s**t.  Even the expression  chew down  is not offensive.  It's, it's...  Enough, man.  I've had it.  Opie's cursing like,  like,  like a sailor.  Holy cow.  Oh, God.  Opie and Anthony.  107.  WNEW.  Hey, you heard for months 
[01:46:00]  about the power stacker too,  the world's strongest fat burner.  It really works.  But don't take my freaking word for it.  Listen to this guy.  Yeah, I took the f**king pill  and within 45 minutes  I was wired  like I drank two pots  of f**king espresso  down at the f**king cafe  on 18th Avenue.  Thank you, tough guy.  All this from one  freaking yellow capsule.  Starts working in 45 minutes  or I break your legs.  That's right.  You'll feel it in 45 minutes  or your legs get busted.  Yeah, I called them up  and I said I didn't feel it  in 45 minutes.  Took 50 minutes.  So they said I'm gonna  send someone down right now  to break your freaking legs. 
[01:46:30]  I said I don't want you  to break my freaking legs.  When's the violence gonna stop?  Call 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  Don't freaking wait  or get it off the web.  Now.  1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  If I started taking  Stacker 2,  I can eat all the cannolis  I want without having to worry.  Stacker 2,  the world's strongest fat burner.  Call 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Call now, you h*****.  Or else you're gonna wanna know  what's gonna happen to you.  Call now.  What the hell was that?  You know what? 
[01:47:00]  That's a good spot right there.  Those Stacker people  are going crazy.  That's a good spot.  That's a very good spot.  Oh my God.  They'll break you  effing legs.  Bravo.  I like when people  in the commercials  threaten you.  I don't laugh  at many commercials.  That was funny.  Wow.  Anthony,  Diamond Vision.  Yes,  Dr. Philotoff.  Yes,  Dr. Philotoff  and Diamond Vision.  This is gonna sound  really queer,  but what the hell.  I was out in South Hold  over the weekend  hanging out with my brother  and his family.  Way out east. 
[01:47:30]  You go five more miles east,  you're in England.  Pretty much, yeah.  And there were deer  running in the fields,  Anthony.  Deer.  Running in the fields  while we were barbecuing.  That's what happens.  You go a little further  and you see  Tyrannosaurus rex  out on Long Island.  It's the land  that time forgot, Opie.  And I was the one  who pointed them out.  I'm like,  wow,  check out those deer.  And I was like,  where?  And they had to like,  they had to,  you know,  get the binoculars.  Really?  You saw them  without the binoculars?  So I know Dr. Philotoff  put one of those  six million dollar  man bionic eyes in there. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah,  I got one of those  ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.  Wait,  what was that noise  he used to make?  I got bionic eyes,  basically.  Thanks to Dr. Philotoff.  Well,  it's pretty freaky  when I couldn't even  drive at night  or do anything  without glasses  and now I...  Well,  to be fair,  I think everyone  in your family  should go to Dr. Philotoff.  Yeah,  yeah.  I think they all  wear glasses,  don't they?  We're the four-eyed family.  Yeah.  Not you,  though.  No,  2015 vision  and I'm seeing deer  in fields now,  which is just bizarre.  You never saw before. 
[01:48:30]  You were a little shaky  about the procedure  when you first  were approached  by the good doctor  to have it done.  Mm-hmm.  You talked with him.  Right.  For like 10 minutes,  he put your mind at ease.  Correct.  Had the procedure done.  How long was it about?  10 minutes tops.  It's nothing.  No,  it was a cakewalk  and then before you know it,  you're seeing deer  in the field  that other people can't see.  Ah,  the Cali girls  are on the line.  Cool.  Tell Edith,  hold on,  we'll talk to her next.  We are syndicated 
[01:49:00]  all over the country.  Underground.  Underground.  Anyway,  yes,  there's a couple  things going on  with Diamond Vision  and Dr. Philotoff.  First of all,  Diamond Vision  is running  their Memorial Day  special,  their Memorial Day  contest,  I should say.  All you have to do  is call up  Diamond Vision  and they'll put your name  in for a free  procedure,  okay?  Nice.  That number is  1-800-984-2020.  1-800-984-2020.  If you've called  that number already,  you will be entered  into this contest as well  if you've entered  some of the past  contests we've done, 
[01:49:30]  okay?  1-800-984-2020.  Diamond Vision  doing the procedure  now.  It's a spring special  for $2,500,  Anthony.  That's a huge bargain.  $2,500 to get  your eyes corrected,  okay?  Yeah.  If you call Diamond  Vision right now.  So there's two things.  You get into the drawing  for the free procedure  or if you don't want  to wait for that  or whatever,  you can pay $2,500  for the procedure.  It's Diamond Vision.  Give them a call.  1-800-984-2020.  1-800-984-2020.  All right?  All right.  All right. 
[01:50:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Yes,  we get these illiterates  off the air, please.  He sucks.  If I wasn't on it,  I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  Everyone in a good mood today.  Nick has moved on  after Miami Heat.  So who do they play now?  We're all aboard  the L train, Anthony.  The L train.  Do it, Anthony.  Oh, okay.  It's doing the L train, baby.  Hey.  I don't know what it means. 
[01:50:30]  We're playing the Heat, Anthony.  Miami Heat.  Pat Riley's team.  And Jeff Van Gundy's brother  is one of the coaches  on the Heat, too.  What?  Jeff Van Gundy.  He's the coach  of the New York Knicks, Anthony.  Oh, that guy.  Right, right.  I knew that name.  Yeah, yeah.  See, if we want to keep  our number one status,  we're going to have to talk  a little more sports  on this show, Anthony.  Who used to be  the coach for the Knicks?  Many people.  Pat Riley.  Pat Riley was the one  I remember.  The greasy-haired guy.  Yes, now he's the coach  of the Miami Heat.  Oh, so that's like  a rivalry now.  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, yeah, okay.  So is this how you feel  when you start talking  about old TV shows  and I look at you  like I don't know  what the hell  you're talking about?  Yeah.  Okay, so it works full-face.  But I've got to say  about the L-Train,  Larry's shot there.  Yeah.  Getting all cocky  with the L-Train,  you know, symbol  after he gave  that three-pointer.  And does the whole  crowd do that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a big thing.  Oh, we're all behind  Larry.  L-Train.  The L-Train.  All aboard the L-Train.  I'll do it.  There we go.  That was, I mean, 
[01:51:30]  a win's a win,  but that was the biggest  brick of the game.  No one banks  a three-pointer.  He meant to do it.  But we'll take it.  Uh, Rich, what's up?  Real fast.  Oh, hey, guys,  don't encourage Larry  with the L-Train, please.  That's nothing.  We can't sanction that.  But I just want to say  I'm old school.  I'm from Boston.  I'm going back  up to school in the fall.  Oh, cool.  You need to get syndicated  before I go back  up to school in Boston.  Well, you know what?  Rich, it's real easy  for Ed and I.  All we have to do  is stay out of trouble  for about 30 to 60 days.  You're already  off on the wrong foot. 
[01:52:00]  They'll open up  the floodgates.  They'll open up  the floodgates.  So we're trying.  We're trying to behave.  Yeah, good job  of staying out of trouble  with that article  on the paper today.  And also,  new priority in the show.  You've got to get  Dice on the show live.  We'll get him in here.  You guys have some  sublime ability  to bring out  the best in comics.  I thought it was  one of those  like watching a TV show  where you're embarrassed  for the guy  in the beginning.  In the end,  he was just awesome.  That's the funniest  stuff you guys have done.  Dice knows what he's doing.  And know what it is, 
[01:52:30]  too, though.  And I just allow  the comedians  to take over.  What the hell?  You know?  And I think that's  where your syndication  problems lie.  That's all right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  Yeah, so the boss  was on the phone  yelling and screaming  about the article  in the Post today.  Guys,  you can't be pissing off  everybody.  Not a certain kind  of understand  the kind of show  you boys do.  But you can't be  pissing off  of Ben Stein  and allegations  of anti-Semitism.  The man 
[01:53:00]  is a celebrity.  I don't understand  you boys.  You can't  stay out of trouble.  I've got to open up  the goddamn papers  and see that  you've pissed off  another person.  Now, look,  you're very talented.  I don't think  you really need  to go there  all the time.  Why don't you  just do some  voices,  do something like that,  try to stay out  of trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I swear  to God,  it doesn't matter  what the ratings are.  You're very well.  You're very proud 
[01:53:30]  of your boy.  You're doing  very good for the company.  But I swear to God,  if I've got to keep  opening up the papers  and see me  pissing people off,  you'll be out the door.  Crap your goose,  my friend.  You don't subscribe  to Entertainment Weekly,  do you, sir?  Oh, for the love of Jesus,  what now?  I'm just asking.  I get it every week.  I read through  the whole thing  when I'm on the trapper.  There just might be  a little blurb  in the next issue  about O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, that's fine.  Syndication 2005.  All right.  There we go. 
[01:54:00]  That's our schedule.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Every day it's something.  Every day.  It's so nice  to be yelled at.  Every day,  and I walk into our office  and we're like,  it's just us.  We're just trying  to do a radio show  and all this crap  is happening around us.  We're having fun.  We have comedic legends  calling us  and thanking us  for inspiring them.  We got Entertainment  Weekly calling.  I'm over here now.  It's like we just  want to do  our little radio show.  What the hell's 
[01:54:30]  going on around us?  I don't know.  Every day they're  writing about something  about us in the paper.  This situation  is mutating, O.P.  as we speak.  It really is mutating.  It is mutating.  Oh, boy.  Psycho Mark  is causing  major problems  near Hofstra.  What's the matter?  Psycho Mark,  what's going on?  Dude,  we got a massive  traffic jam  that is literally  gridlocking  on the Hofstra.  You know what?  You know what?  You know what?  You know what?  You know what?  You know what?  Really?  Security just threw  me out,  so I drove one way  out the exit,  you know,  like a nut case.  And now we're  right across the street 
[01:55:00]  in front of  Subway here  in Dunkin' Donuts,  right on the highway  right here  next to the Hofstra entrance.  Okay.  And we're handing them  out left and right.  People are trying  to hit each other  to get the stickers.  It's crazy.  It's madness.  See?  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  It's crazy.  It's absolutely  people handing out  beers.  It's like,  you know,  hey,  hey,  why not?  That's very cold.  Yeah,  handing out the  wow stickers  on Long Island.  Yay!  I drove around  all weekend, 
[01:55:30]  didn't see one damn  wow sign on the LIA.  A little pissed off,  so let's get those  stickers out.  All right,  you're going to stay  there for a little  longer or what?  I'm going to be here  for at least another  half hour, I hope.  All right, cool.  And then I'm going to  head back to the city  because Earl has to  actually do some work.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  Who's are you kidding?  Hey,  show us your fun bag.  All right,  Psycho, Mark.  Kicks are pulling up  left and right.  Look at all these  babies.  What caused a massive  traffic jam?  This is not good.  All right,  well,  just follow the wow van  around if you want 
[01:56:00]  your wow sticker.  It's out there.  All right,  Mark,  we're going to let you  go, all right?  See you guys.  All right,  bye.  Later, man.  Very cool.  Let's go to Chris  real fast.  Chris,  what's going on?  Hey,  Chris.  Yeah,  what's up?  Hey,  you're on the air.  What's up?  Yeah,  man,  you guys made a mess  out there,  bro.  In Hofstra?  Absolutely.  It's a mess out there?  Yeah,  it was like three lanes  worth of people  trying to turn it  to the entrance.  Oh,  my God.  They tried to get out  and then forget it.  People hawking.  I saw an ambulance  drive by and the guys  are screaming out  in the megaphone,  you guys suck. 
[01:56:30]  Michael,  awesome.  Awesome.  All right,  man.  Thank you,  Chris.  You know,  my first radio  appearance was on  Hofstra's radio station.  Wow,  look at you.  That's right.  I remember Eric Hewler  was the guy out there  and invited me  and the rocket guys  on the show.  He's probably still  working there.  So don't you think  you're all high and mighty.  People recognize  the Anthony talent  long before opening.  Oh,  boy. 
[01:57:00]  Edith's calling us  from Cali,  our California listener.  Edith.  I was just a radio whore  trying to get on somewhere.  Hi,  Edith.  Hi,  how are you guys?  Hey.  Yeah,  this is Edith.  How are you doing?  I recognize the voice.  How are you today,  Edith?  I'm great.  She's calling us  from Southern California.  She's a huge fan  of the Opie and Anthony show  and listens to us  every day.  Every single day.  Yeah.  Even though we're not  even syndicated,  but we have this whole  syndication underground thing  popping up everywhere.  Syndication California.  Syndication Cali, 
[01:57:30]  yeah.  Yep.  How's the weather out there?  Very nice.  Very nice.  85 degrees.  Nice and sunny.  Sunny.  Oh,  so beautiful.  So when do we get  to see a picture of you?  When are you going to send  my stuff?  We sent the wow stuff  last week,  I believe.  Oh,  I haven't got it yet.  Send a pic,  man.  The stuff's in the mail.  Don't worry.  If you're a pig,  we can't take it back.  We don't even care  if you're a pig.  I know.  You say you're all hot  and stuff,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got the tan going  from California  and everything.  Right on.  Did you hear  Dice call today?  Yes,  I did.  That was sweet. 
[01:58:00]  That was pretty cool.  And that weird  Dice is calling  from California.  He calls here  and then she listens  from California  over the internet.  Right.  Wow,  it's getting wacky.  I think I might  come down there  in New York  and visit a friend.  Oh,  yeah?  Yeah,  if I do,  I want to come  see you guys.  Ah,  you're more than  welcome.  Can we drip  hot wax all over  your body?  No.  We need another  girl that's brave  enough for Aunt  and I to drip  hot wax all over.  Hot wax thing,  we like that.  We want to do  that later on  this week,  matter of fact,  so any ladies  will think of  something.  All right.  It's been fun for us. 
[01:58:30]  Well,  you're having no  problem finding us  on the internet,  huh?  No problem  whatsoever.  How old did  you say you were?  22.  How does a young  girl like you  get a name  like Edith?  Oh,  it's a long story.  I got my mom's  middle name.  The cruel parents.  I know.  That's like  names like  Martha,  Margaret,  and stuff like  that.  Gertrude.  Gertrude.  Hey,  Gertie.  Gertie.  You know,  you don't see  any young girls  named Gertie.  Back there in  the 20s and 30s,  you know,  Gertie was a hottie.  Hey,  Gertie, 
[01:59:00]  man.  Let me see  your fun bags.  When you're  getting banged,  does the guy  scream out Edith?  Yeah,  like Archie.  Oh,  see,  that's kind of  to the moon.  What's your nickname?  Edie.  Edie?  That's kind of cool.  That's all right.  Edie's good.  That's a little cooler.  I would just  call you  Filthy Animal.  And spray the  banana juice  out of my  yam bags.  Yam bags.  Freaking dies,  man.  That's hilarious.  All right,  Edie,  I'm just going to  call you Edie.  I'm never going  to call you Edie.  Oh,  great. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  All right.  So,  Edie.  Yes?  When they shut  down that  website that  you're checking  out the show  on,  will you be  able to find  it somewhere  else,  hopefully?  Because we'd  feel bad.  No,  I have this  program,  and they  were told  me I  can't say  the name,  but I  installed this  program on my  computer.  It's like a  radio,  and you can  check out all  different stations  across the world.  Yeah,  we know exactly  which one,  but they  changed where  it is on the  front page,  the radio  thing.  Yeah,  they went from  talk to comedy, 
[02:00:00]  I believe.  All right.  But that's  okay,  but you found it.  Well,  I have you guys  set on my  favorites.  So we just  get in there.  Nice.  Oh,  okay.  Right on in.  All right,  Edie.  Well,  keep in touch,  and let us  know when you  get our  little care  package.  Okay,  I will.  All right,  Edie.  Good evening,  you guys.  Right on.  Bye.  There she  goes,  our California  listener,  our California  connection.  One listener  per state.  No,  we're starting  this,  well,  we're not  starting,  you guys  have started  a while ago,  this syndication 
[02:00:30]  just do it  if you have  to,  but don't  tell us.  Yeah,  we don't  want to  know.  If you  know what  I mean.  Yeah,  please.  All right.  This guy's  pissed off.  Why is this  guy pissed  off?  David,  what's going  on?  Hey,  guys,  you know,  I get out  of work  at 5 o'clock  and it's  freaking  5.30  already.  It would  really be  nice if I  could get  out of  Hofstra  campus  sometime  today.  Could  you please  get those  two jerks  out of  here?  I swear  to God, 
[02:01:00]  I cannot  go home.  What's  the scene  out there?  How  crowded  is it?  Well,  you know,  it's great.  You have  three lanes  of traffic  trying to  pull out  of this  one little  spot at  Hofstra.  You can't  turn off  a Hempstead  turnpike.  You can't  get on it.  You've  got 15  people out  in front  of Dunkin'  Donuts  and surprisingly  only half  of them  are cops.  This is  horrible.  I want  to go  home.  All right.  We'll  talk to  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark  handing out  the Whippin'  Mount Wednesday  stickers outside  at Hofstra  today.  All right,  David.  Yeah,  thanks a lot.  I take  syndication  2017, 
[02:01:30]  right?  Thanks a lot.  Sorry,  man.  There he  goes.  He's  fast.  John,  what's  going on?  Hey,  I just  came from  Hofstra.  I got my  WOW stickers.  Yeah.  Guys are  making a  mess out  there,  man.  Really?  I'm  sure.  Mark  always  complies  with traffic  laws,  so I'm  sure  everything's  fine.  You know  what you  got to  tell them  to do  is they  got to  go around  the  corner  in front  of Napa  Coliseum  there on  like Earl  Ovington  Boulevard.  Yeah.  There's a lot  less traffic  over there.  There's just  people.  Oh, 
[02:02:00]  you can't  get around  there.  I got my  stickers,  but everyone's  honking at me,  trying to get me  out of the way.  It's crazy.  Wow.  All right,  John,  thank you.  All right.  Cool.  Later.  If you can't  get out to  Hofstra,  just look for  a Ranch 1  location.  Yeah.  Participating  Ranch 1  locations have  the WOW  stickers as  well.  Everyone is  calling for  their car  phones.  I guess  the hot  matter is  just a  complete  mess.  It's a  mess.  Sorry.  We're just  trying to  give out  the stickers  and stuff. 
[02:02:30]  I'm  stalling  because I  didn't  pick them.  Is that  Psychomark  on line  12?  Do we  know?  Bueller?  Psychomark.  Yeah,  what's up?  You are  pissing off  so many  people out  there.  Why?  Huh?  Why?  Why am I  pissing  people off?  You've  effed up  traffic.  You're  causing  traffic jams  and stuff.  So what?  They don't  have a  traffic jam  to sit  in anyhow.  So what  are you  doing now?  We're just  hanging out  here with  Earl.  We're handing  out stickers  right in front  of the store  and causing 
[02:03:00]  problems.  All right.  How many  have you  given out  a lot  or what?  I'd say  probably  we've  given out  close to  about  500  already.  Nice.  And that's  no joke,  dude.  All right,  cool.  They're  flying out  of our  hands.  We can  put them  in them.  All right.  Everyone's  being cool  out there?  Everyone's  so cool.  People are  beeping,  yelling,  screaming.  Right.  All right.  It's a  lot of  fun.  All right,  get your  sticker.  You're  going to  stay  there for  a while?  Yeah,  I'll  probably  stay  till  exactly  6 o'clock  and then  we'll  scroll  back  to  the  city.  All right,  cool,  man. 
[02:03:30]  All right,  guys.  Thank you.  And Jersey,  don't worry,  we'll get  to you by  the end  of the  week,  hopefully.  Yeah,  we have  the  wow  van  handing  out  the  wow  stickers  making  mayhem.  All right,  we've got  to take  a break.  I wanted  to talk  about  the  livery  cab  thing.  Yeah.  Steve  Dunleavy  kind of  took  our  lead.  I'm  sure a  lot of  people  thought  exactly  what  we  were  saying  on  Friday  about  all  these  deaths.  They're  being  like  slaughtered, 
[02:04:00]  like it's  a war  zone now  with these  livery cab  drivers and  a lot of  people were  bitching and  complaining that  blacks can't  get cabs to  take them up  into bad  neighborhoods.  And Dunleavy  was just  saying,  hey,  they understand  what these  bad  neighborhoods  are like  because a  lot of  the cabbies  live in  them because  they can't  afford to  live in  nice areas.  Not only do  they live in  these areas,  they understand  what the  crime is  like in  them and  they just  don't want  to go  there.  That's  what it  is.  And like  if Dunleavy 
[02:04:30]  said,  why don't  we get  some of  these  people  that are  protesting  that the  cabbies  won't pick  up people  of certain  ethnic  backgrounds  and let  them drive  the cab  for a while.  Give Danny  Glover a  little  livery cab.  Because it's  not white  guys in  cabs  necessarily  turning  people down.  cabbies  are  immigrants.  They're  people from  all over  the place.  And they're  getting killed  going to  bad  neighborhoods.  All these 
[02:05:00]  killings are  happening in  the Bronx  and in  very bad  parts of  Brooklyn,  like East  New York,  Brooklyn.  I mean,  come on.  You've got to be a  rocket scientist.  Jesus.  They're finally  getting the  partitions up.  Yeah, well.  That's something  they should have  done a long  time ago.  A while ago.  Remember when  they weren't  even in the  yellow cabs?  The partitions?  That's nuts.  That'd be crazy.  Hey, Anthony,  Reverend Al?  Yeah.  Has a solution  to the problems  with delivery cab  drivers.  Oh, really? 
[02:05:30]  What is it?  Black seat cabs.  Oh, yeah.  Remember black seat  cabs?  Of course.  Reverend Al?  This is from the  ONA archives.  Check it out.  Look who's coming  through the door,  Anthony.  Huh?  Reverend Al,  coming through the  door, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I think he has  some commentary  on the Danny Glover  blacks can't get  cabs in New York.  Does he?  I believe so.  Well, there's his  music.  Well, there's his  music, and here he  comes through the  door, everyone.  Reverend Al!  Outraged!  I am outraged! 
[02:06:00]  Outraged!  Where are the  lesbians?  Who gives a crap  about no taxi cab?  I can't believe  that that Oki  from Muskogee  wouldn't show up  boobies.  What the hell's  going on?  I don't know.  And Rick sounds  like a goddamn  pervert, man.  Yeah, sure does.  Rick's more  disgusting than  the movie.  Hey, Reverend Al,  you want to see  some white boobies?  Well, I like to  stick to my  black sisters.  Yeah.  But what the hell?  All right.  Since she's here, 
[02:06:30]  let's see some  dairy.  Oh, yeah!  Yeah, baby.  Reverend Al likes  that.  That's why Reverend Al  likes coming here.  There you go.  The Ovi and  Anthony show.  But I'm outraged!  Now, what are you  outraged about today?  Why can't a black man  get a taxi cab  in New York City?  I don't know.  Our own black girl  had trouble early  in the program.  Yeah.  Even your Reverend Al  has been turned down  trying to get a taxi cab.  I can't get to dinner.  I'm outraged. 
[02:07:00]  Reverend Al's got to be fed.  Stop that car,  you towelhead.  I am starting my own  taxi cab service  for the community.  Oh, yeah?  Reverend Al's  black sea cab  service in the Bronx  in Harlem  and certain parts  of Brooklyn.  Unlike the white cab,  Reverend Al's  black sea cab  will not be  crime victorious.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They are modified  Bradley armored 
[02:07:30]  fighting vehicles.  That's right.  Where comfort abounds  and they can take  a few rounds.  When you get in,  you get a message  of safety  from Reverend Al.  Okay.  Welcome.  Buckle up  and put on  your complimentary  black jacket.  And remember,  no shooting  inside the vehicle  due to ricochet.  Thank you.  Have a nice trip  on Reverend Al's  black sea cab. 
[02:08:00]  See, the white folks  cab is equipped  with what?  Ample trunk space.  Yo, Reverend Al's  cab,  twin 50 millimeter  cannons with  tracer rounds  and stinger  anti-aircraft missile  to clear the way  to your destination.  That's right.  Reverend Al's  black sea cab,  our motto,  the engine's loud  and the paint is faded,  but sit back  and relax  where Alma-plated. 
[02:08:30]  So I'll be bringing  those into the community  very shortly.  If you send your donations  to Reverend Al  at the Palo Theater  in Harlem.  Thank you.  I am Al Ray.  All right, there he goes.  Reverend Al, everyone.  Where's that southern  hick bitch?  Take your top off.  I am Al Ray.  There he goes.  Reverend Al.  Yeah.  Boy, he's angry.  He's a little angrier  ever now.  I think he's more angry  about the prude  not getting top. 
[02:09:00]  Well, who wouldn't be?  Okay.  That brings the races  together, doesn't it?  He's going to know  we can agree on something,  right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're never going  to amount to anything.  It's awful.  It's awful.  Very, very effective.  It's all of a crazy airwaves.  I cannot believe  that those morons  are on the air.  I don't know, Anthony.  I think this is better  than a rock block,  don't you?  Only half is nauseating.  Anthony, we're in the middle  of a commercial break,  but I've got to go  to the phone real fast.  Kevin, what's up? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, I just passed by Hasha.  I go to the Ivy League  National Community College.  Yeah.  And, uh,  Psycho Mark's  jumping in front of cars.  I'm giving out the...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You can't say that.  You've got to watch  the F word.  Psycho Mark jumping  up and down,  giving out wow stickers,  and it's very effing funny.  It's really funny, guys.  Okay.  I think he's going to get hit.  Well, that's why  we call him Psycho Mark.  He doesn't care.  He just doesn't care.  He really doesn't.  All right, thank you.  All right, thanks a lot, man.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, Psycho Mark 
[02:10:00]  just making a scene  around Hofstra,  giving out the new  wow stickers today.  Anthony, Fidelity Diamond.  Yes.  We love Fidelity Diamond,  and let me tell you why.  They make it so easy  to get an engagement ring.  And a good engagement ring,  one that's worth the money.  Yeah, because they put you  at ease.  I mean, you want to make  that big step.  You want to get  the engagement ring.  You don't know where to go.  You don't know  if you're going to get  ripped off.  Are you an expert, Opie,  on diamonds?  Am I?  Who is?  Someone could sell me  a rock that they picked 
[02:10:30]  up off the ground  and say it's a diamond.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Fidelity Diamond  educates you.  Correct.  Buying a diamond.  Yeah, they explain to you  why it's a good diamond.  They weigh it right  in front of you, Anthony.  Yeah.  They set it right in front of you.  You watch the whole process.  They educate you.  You walk out of the store  going, you know what?  I just got a good diamond.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  For a great price.  And Tom Colosino  and the gang  at Fidelity Diamond,  they've been doing this  for a very long time.  I think this is like  their 18th year  in business, Anthony.  Yeah.  So if you're getting engaged 
[02:11:00]  in the near future,  I do believe you're going  to want to call  Fidelity Diamond  for a confidential,  a confidential,  confidential appointment.  Yeah.  That procedure  might as well be painless.  I mean,  if you're getting married,  something better be painless.  Yeah.  After that talk  with Dice a little earlier.  Yeah.  But anyway,  call Fidelity Diamond  at 201-261-6555.  That's 201-261-6555  for Fidelity Diamond.  They're located  on Route 17  South in Paramus, 
[02:11:30]  just minutes from Manhattan  and Rockland County.  I mention that  because I see  at the bottom  of this copy here,  Fidelity Diamond  is proud to host  a WOW sticker stop, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  They got WOW stickers  at Fidelity Diamond.  Nice.  Like right now?  Right now or tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow they'll have  WOW stickers.  Cool.  Another place  to get your WOW stickers.  Fidelity Diamond  located on Route 17  South in Paramus.  Okay?  Great.  Fidelity Diamond,  and give them a call  201-261-6555. 
[02:12:00]  I'm running out  of brain at this point.  And Anthony.  I'm a brainless buffoon.  The Opie and Anthony show.  More stupidity on the way.  That was pretty funny.  Jimmy does a great job  with those sweepers.  Sometimes I'm not sure  if he likes us or not.  No, because he makes us  look really bad.  I know.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah, we don't mind.  That's funny stuff.  Tom checking in  on instant feedback  from Hofstra. 
[02:12:30]  I guess he has a view.  Here go the cops  on Hempstead Turnpike.  Uh-oh.  All right, here's the deal.  Psycho Mark's been  handing out WOW stickers,  the brand new WOW stickers  outside Hofstra  for the last hour.  He's caused traffic jams  and everything. We're trying to move on with our  radio show, but people are calling in like  crazy. It seems  that Psycho Mark has caused  an accident outside of  Hofstra, Anthony. No.  Well, let's see what's going on here. Gabe, what's  going on? What's up, ONA?  How are you? I was actually driving to Hofstra  to get some wow stickers, 
[02:13:00]  and over my flight department scanner  comes an auto accident at the  Hofstra underpass, right in front  of Hofstra for the Uniondale Flight Department.  I'm about 100 yards away  right now. I'm trying to get up there. There's  cops, there's chief cars,  and they're talking they need ambulances  up there. I don't know what the hell he did.  Uh-oh.  No, I don't... If he's  on the Dunkin' Donuts side, he's on the opposite side.  Right now, this is on the westbound side.  So maybe that Mark's not  associated with this? I don't know, 
[02:13:30]  because you say he's at what, Dunkin' Donuts?  All right, hold on the line, because I want you to get in the scene.  Yeah, Mark was marked. Hold on.  Let's see it from Mark. Psycho Mark.  Hey, what's up, man? What's happening? You didn't call him out.  Now, as you can hear,  there's an accident.  What?  And, uh, it's not our fault.  Oh, it's not your fault?  It's not our fault. I repeat,  it's not our fault. Here you go, dude.  And, uh, there's tons of people  coming by. There's still hand-stickers out.  Yeah.  We'll have a traffic jam, but the accident's not our fault.  Oh, God.  It was an accident! 
[02:14:00]  All right, thank you, Psycho Mark.  Sorry, guys. I don't know what there was any confusion about.  All right, thank God you did not cause that accident.  Did not cause the accident. Gotta go. Bye.  All right, bye. There he goes.  Uh, John, what's going on?  John?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good. What's up?  What's up? Open in?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just drove past.  Some dude's lying out there, like, unconscious and whatnot.  I just went under the bridge.  All right.  I'm looking for this crazy guy.  Where's this guy handing out the stickers over here?  Ah, here he is.  There he is.  No, you just found him? Okay. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  All right, John. Thank you.  Hey, take care of that swamp lift.  All right.  You ass.  He got that in.  Yeah, I know.  Psycho Mark was over by the Dunkin' Donuts.  He's on the other side.  Yeah, unfortunately, Psycho Mark didn't cause an accident.  He slows down the track.  Unfortunately, he wasn't in the accident.  Hey, Donut, I just got hit by a car.  It was great.  What a buzz.  I'm whacked.  I don't even know I was hit.  It's great.  I can't feel my legs. 
[02:15:00]  It's rules.  He's out of his mind.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  What else do we have to do today?  God, we've talked about just about everything that was going on over the weekend.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think.  There was something else, something else, something else.  Yeah, there was something.  You want to talk about the MTV VJ script?  Oh, that's...  I've been talking about it.  Well, you know something?  I saw some of it.  I caught some of it.  They're trying to get a new VJ for MTV.  The whole thing's a joke. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, from the same contest that brought you the likes of Jesse Camp a couple of years back.  They got a new collection of losers that they parade in front of people,  and they get to vote for the newest VJ.  MTV want to be a VJ3.  They don't even use the VJs they pick.  They use them for a little while, and then they, like, you know, fade them out fast.  They show up at those dopey appearances they do and just act like an idiot.  This new guy is the closest thing to Jesse I've seen so far. 
[02:16:00]  This guy, Raymond.  Raymond?  He looks like Puck.  He's a Puck wannabe.  Remember Puck from the real world?  Puck Rock.  Puck.  Big capital letters.  F-U-N.  Fun.  I'm on eight.  I'm on eight.  You don't want to see me on ten.  Puck.  Puck.  I saw you put your fingers in the peanut butter.  You pick your scabs.  You put the fingers in the peanut butter, Puck.  This is not a healthy environment.  I have HIV.  This is not healthy for me. 
[02:16:30]  Either Puck goes or I go.  Now, look.  I'm getting married soon.  Yes, he's cute.  I really love.  He's cute.  We're getting married.  I'm going to see Rachel's family.  Me and Rachel.  That was the best real world by far.  By far.  Yeah, so this new guy is, I don't know, this Puck wannabe looking guy.  And the whole contest, the way they did it, has nothing to do with being a VJ. 
[02:17:00]  I think the best part of being a VJ, or the best job anyone does, is if you don't notice that they're a VJ.  If they're just talking and you're paying attention to whoever they're interviewing or whatever song they're introing.  You know what I mean?  But these guys, they didn't even know how to hold mics to interview these people.  They have them interviewing people.  And, like, as the person's talking, they still have the mic in front of their mouth.  And the person stops talking and they whip the mic in front of their mouth.  Like, they can't get the mic technique right.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Remember that one?  David Letterman used to put, what's his name?  What is that short little fat guy?  Larry Budd.  Larry Budd Melman out on the street?  Yeah.  Hello?  Where are you from?  Yeah, remember that.  Okay, and what are you doing?  He put the, pull the mic away and put it in front of the face before he was done talking.  Before he was done with his question.  That's exactly what they were doing.  And the other guy, another guy was holding it like a, he thought he was a rap star.  You know how you've got to hold the mic straight up and down?  What?  Rappers can't hold mics or guns properly.  Hold the gun up so you've got the sights up top, not sideways. 
[02:18:00]  That's why so many innocent bystanders get shot.  Sideways?  They're upside down now.  They go upside down like this now.  You're buck, buck, you give.  I've got some camp in your air.  Bam, bam, bam.  I've got my nana purple camp in your way.  No, you're hitting the kid across the street because you're not using the sights properly.  I think gun education in the rap community will save thousands of lives.  But they're holding the mic like a, yeah, if you're going to shoot, aim.  Aim the damn gun.  Not upside down, backwards like y'all.  Maybe we can't stop the shooting, Opie, but maybe we can help them hit their targets. 
[02:18:30]  Another low life.  It's upside down now.  The gun here.  I'm over here now.  Shoot over here now.  So they're holding the mic all like, yo, yo, what's up?  Yeah.  And just a collection.  One bimbo, she was a Jennifer Lopez wannabe.  She was dressed like Nikki from We Deliver Keggers with the cowboy hat.  And that is pretty funny.  And then there was some black guy that thought he was all smooth and stuff. 
[02:19:00]  They voted him out.  And they picked this schmuck.  And I'm just like, you know, look at the Jesse Camp tapes, pal, because that's where you're going to be.  I'm just amazed that you sat and watched some of this.  Sometimes you feel compelled.  I couldn't get through 30 seconds of it.  Carson.  Couldn't do it.  Carson looked so pissed off.  Yeah, but Carson has some serious problems, too.  Yeah.  Because now he is trying to sound so freaking black with the lingo and stuff when he's interviewing these people.  Yeah.  And he just looks stupid.  He just looks, just act yourself. 
[02:19:30]  You're not a dude from the hood.  You know what's funny?  I think his new chick is dressing him.  Yeah, with the super glasses.  Like, he's got this new hot chick, this, what's her name?  Tara Reed, something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  And, like, she's, I think she's giving him ideas.  Like, he had this black nail polish on at one point.  You know, she's probably like, baby, put the black nail polish on.  No, I don't want to.  You look cute.  Put it on.  You look cute.  I think you look cute.  Wear it on the show.  Oh, no, I can't wear it on the show. 
[02:20:00]  If you love me, you wear it on the show.  You want, oh, and all of a sudden there's Carson, hi, Carson Daly, with the black nail polish on.  And I was wearing those glasses.  But you wear, those, if I remember, at least when I was growing up, they were called retard glasses.  The only kid that wore them were the retards.  He's trying to, he's trying to start a new trend, isn't he?  Well, it ain't washing.  But the black lingo's got to go, Carson.  You sound completely stupid.  And then they had that blonde chick that was running. 
[02:20:30]  She didn't know who the king of pop was.  She's trying to be a VJ, Opie.  Yeah.  She didn't know who the king of pop was.  Well, except pedophile.  That's an answer.  That's your final answer.  Yeah, so Carson looked all pissed off.  And you've got to give him something for it.  Because, you know, he tried, he worked at being a VJ.  And that's how he got in.  He didn't just, like, show up at an audition.  Well, he's a radio guy.  He was pretty successful out there in L.A.  Yeah.  No, he wasn't.  He was on for a year.  He did all right. 
[02:21:00]  He did.  He was on for a year.  Look at Rick all bitter.  Rick wants to be Carson Daly.  So good.  No glasses and no fat clothes.  Let me tell you something about Rick.  Oh, my God.  Rick wants to be Carson Daly so bad.  I don't want to be Carson Daly.  No, you want to be him.  Ouch.  Ouch.  That hurt.  I can hear it in your voice.  I said he was successful in L.A.  And you're like, no.  I've been tracking his career.  He actually did well in L.A.  Well, because MTV came calling because they thought he had some talent. 
[02:21:30]  But, like, you know, Rick, your dream job is MTV.  At least admit it.  It's not.  If MTV called tomorrow and said, we want you to audition, you wouldn't go?  Probably not.  You're such a liar.  Oh, please.  You picked something else that wasn't that.  We've seen the Mulcahy's tape.  Oh, that was eons ago.  Yeah.  I guarantee you want to be a B.J.  I do not.  I mean, oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  What?  Is that a stab?  I don't get it.  It was a joke. 
[02:22:00]  He called you.  You can't say it on the air, but he called you that.  I don't know.  Why?  Why would you?  I don't even get it.  What's the joke?  Yeah, what is that?  What?  Are you reaching?  No, not at all.  Well, he's just trying to say it.  I don't get it.  I don't know.  He's trying to call me someone else to make fun of me?  What was that?  Yeah, a little joke.  Oh, because I tried after VH1?  Right.  Oh.  Let's see.  That was a while ago.  It's okay.  It still works. 
[02:22:30]  Dude, I would never go on VH1, first of all.  That wouldn't work.  Do you guys remember that?  What?  Yeah, our old boss wanted to hire Carson.  Yeah.  I'm after you guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Jesus.  Are you done with that thought, Anthony?  Yeah, I was just saying.  And he's probably pissed off that he worked at it, you know, went through some channels  and stuff, and was hired because of whatever talent he has to be a VJ, you know, whatever  you have to do.  To make it look natural, I think, is kind of rough, you know?  Right.  And then they just get these dweebs off the street, and it's got to piss them off, you 
[02:23:00]  know?  Imagine that.  You go through, like I was saying with the airline pilot, you go through all that training,  maybe the Air Force, learn how to fly, and all of a sudden you go into the cockpit  and there's the pilot.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I won this job.  Right.  Mark, you're out of stickers and you're coming home?  Yeah, we're completely out of stickers.  All right.  We're on the way back.  All right.  Cool, man.  We'll see you when you get back.  Excellent.  Psycho Mark's done causing havoc out there at Hofstra.  Someone wants to call you a homo? 
[02:23:30]  Why?  Tommy, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Anthony.  Yeah.  You're going to no-doubt shows.  You're monitoring MTV.  Are you part homo?  Yeah, boy, that must be it.  Jeez, ooh, you got me there.  MTV is so lame.  I mean, we're in our 30s.  I know it is.  We were in touch with MTV about 10 years ago.  Dude, don't you understand?  I know it's lame.  I watch it because it's lame.  I watch it for the real world.  Yeah, but you don't torture it.  I mean, isn't it slow torture just sitting through these guys that just babble and babble  and who are absolutely not in touch with anything? 
[02:24:00]  Well, they are.  Tommy, here's a clue.  It's my effing job, you know?  I turn on stuff.  I watch it.  Then we talk about it.  I mean, the girls are hot, but these old VJs, I mean, they're half a queer.  I don't know how the hell.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  That Carson Daly, he's got to be a homo.  Hey, watch who you're calling homo.  I'm offended.  Did he used to go out with Jennifer Lovey with that Carson Daly?  Yeah.  Yes.  What the hell did she sing in him?  I don't know.  He must have a wang.  All right.  A deep one.  Well, thank you, Tommy. 
[02:24:30]  Syndication on the ground.  Yes.  There you go.  What's happening everywhere?  Syndication, allegedly.  Allegedly.  Hi, Edith.  Hi, Edie.  Yeah, call her Edie.  Edie.  Edie.  Edie.  You can't just get your groove on with Edith.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  We have...  Let's just put the word out there right now.  Okay.  Who else is listening to us around the country?  Around the country.  We have one listener...  And don't BS us.  Yeah, don't BS us, because that's not cool.  Yeah.  We have one listener in Cali, Edie. 
[02:25:00]  I wonder if there's anybody else.  Yeah.  It's got to be Edie, though.  How are you going to get into...  Yeah.  Oh, Edith.  The only thing you'd think is like, oh, that feels so good.  I wonder if...  Stick your tongue in it, Archie.  Oh, yeah.  Agnes.  You spread them, Agnes.  I wonder if Sweetness is listening to us on the Internet these days.  I remember her.  Sweetness. 
[02:25:30]  Sweetness was on the Internet.  She had one of those home cams.  She's been emailing me, but I just...  Really?  We just don't have the heart to do that again.  There was something called...  It's still out there, I guess, the Jenny Cam.  It was pretty much the first chick that really got notoriety for putting her life on the web.  And you could tune in occasionally, and sometimes she'd just be doing her homework or laundry,  or there'd be an empty room.  But occasionally you'd tune in, and she might be banging her boyfriend,  or she might be sleeping, and the covers would come off her ass,  and you'd see her kind of naked.  It was kind of cool.  It was the beginning of the whole Internet thing when people were putting webcams on. 
[02:26:00]  So we get a line on another one called Sweetness Cam.  Sweetness.  Like, oh, let's check out Sweetness.  We punch her up.  She's about 20 years old, and big, fat ass.  Huge ass.  But her youth kind of covered up for it.  She had nice, firm boobies.  Huge cam.  Huge, firm boobies.  But a big ass.  And she would just...  Anytime she's on camera, she's using toys,  and she's just writing stuff on her body,  and she's effing, and just everything. 
[02:26:30]  So it was kind of cool to watch, even though she was chubby.  Yeah.  So she emailed us a little while ago,  and we checked her camera again now, a few years later.  Now I guess she's probably, what, 24?  Yeah, 24-ish.  Oh, time hasn't been kind.  Oh, my God.  Gravity working on mass.  Right.  It's unbelievable what happened.  She's from Minnesota.  Sweetness.  Sweetness.  We used to get her to do some crazy-ass things.  Yeah, we'd be on the air, and we'd have her cam popped up, 
[02:27:00]  and we'd say, okay, write Opie and Anthony on your big boobs,  and she'd do that.  All right, see that thing that's next to you on the bed?  Make it disappear.  Yeah.  And she would.  Gonzo.  Kind of fun.  Interactive computer.  And then listeners would request things for her to do,  and she would do it.  And this was only a few years back,  but it was before they really got into the pay thing on this.  It used to be, but people just did it because they loved people watching them.  Yeah.  So you pop on the cameras, but now it's all behind pay sites.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Screw it.  Hey, we've got a listener from Philadelphia.  Philly.  Hey, Felix from Philly, our Philadelphia.  This is Felix from Philadelphia.  Are you really listening to us from Philadelphia?  Yes, I am, sir.  Where do you live in Philly, man?  South Philly.  South Philly.  We don't know how you're listening to us, but...  Don't need to.  You'll find out.  All right.  All right, Philly.  Now, why did you decide to listen to us in Philadelphia?  I've got a cousin who lives there,  and I couldn't stop staying and listening to the damn stories every day, in and out. 
[02:28:00]  He would actually call me to get some at, like, 6.  He calls me and just sets the phone on the radio, and I'd just listen.  Oh, cool.  See, that's what we mean by syndication underground.  Any way possible.  Any way possible.  Syndication at all costs.  I've only been listening for about...  I mean, I've been listening for about a month or so since he's been listening,  but, you know, I've been listening all last week and today.  Oh, cool.  It's hysterical, hysterical show, gentlemen.  Thank you, man.  All right, we'll remember you, Felix. 
[02:28:30]  We've got Felix in Philadelphia, and we've got Edie in California.  There we go.  Thank you, Felix.  Thank you for checking in, Philly.  Philadelphia, I'm from our Philly affiliate.  Anthony, can I just ask you a quick request?  Yes.  Can I get a punchy in the uterus from Mike Tyson?  Hold on.  All right.  Hey, hey, wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  Someone's screwing with my volume number.  All right, Felix.  Now, I can't punch you in the uterus.  That's right.  So, uh, I will punch you in the prostate.  I prefer testicles. 
[02:29:00]  Can you punch me in the testicles?  All right.  I will punch you in the testicles.  All right, bend over and push everything below to make the bowl of fruit.  You ever hear that?  You see when some guy pushes, like he tried to look like a woman, so he takes his junk and  puts it between the legs and crosses the legs so it looks like a woman from the front?  That's a fact.  Well, from the back, it's called a bowl of fruit.  Now, do that and bend over, get a good view, and, oh, there we go, right in the testicles. 
[02:29:30]  I'm working like a speed bag.  I've got one question.  What is this Diamond Dust guy?  Oh, we don't want to talk about Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust.  Oh, man, this is so intense.  I can't get any answers from my cousin.  He's like, yeah, I just got to listen.  Opie's old CB handle.  When I was really, wait, I was really young, though.  I know that doesn't help my cross here, but.  Hey, Opie, what kind of name is that?  Anybody got the rear sign?  It's Diamond Dust out of here.  I was 10, 10, 10, 8 on the side.  I was 10 years old, sure.  10 or 11 years old. 
[02:30:00]  Diamond Dust.  Yeah.  I know.  All right, gentlemen, keep up the good work.  Hope they'll be able to come home one day and actually turn the radio on with you guys.  Thank you, Philly.  There he goes.  Thank you, Felix.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Felix from Philly.  All right.  That's cool.  That rocks.  Got a guy in Philly and a chick in L.A., Anthony.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break, okay?  No more MTV crap.  We're done with that.  Yeah.  Actually, we're done with just about every phone call there, except for line one. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, wait.  This guy.  All right.  Hold on real fast.  Chris, what's going on?  Chris?  Yeah, hey.  What's up, man?  I was in Atlanta all last week.  I listened to you guys.  Really?  I'll be there all this summer.  I'll listen to you guys then.  So, pretty awesome.  You've discovered a way to listen to us in other cities.  Yep.  Atlanta.  I find that amazing.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  All right, Chris.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Syndication.  Look what we've got to do.  If they were just syndicated, it would be so much easier, wouldn't it, Opie?  And the company would make so much money.  But now the show, much like healthy kidneys and heroin, is on the black market.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  You should see some of the emails that come in, what people are doing to spread the word of this show.  It's amazing.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:31:30]  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony, we've got to say hi to New Zealand.  Yeah.  Got a guy in New Zealand checking us out.  Illegally.  His name is Ad.  Ad.  A-D.  Ad.  From New Zealand.  Hey, Ad.  Addy.  Addy, New Zealand.  Also, Texas checking in.  Upstate Connecticut checking in.  Don't they talk like that in New Zealand? 
[02:32:00]  Something like that.  Someone's like an Aussie accent.  They drink a lot and screw sheep.  Yeah, there's a lot of sheep down there.  Yeah, more sheep than people, I believe.  Yeah.  See, we've got to get to know our countries if we're going to be syndicated on our audience.  Hello, New Zealand.  We also have...  Who else is checking in?  Northern Connecticut.  Yep.  Where our signal doesn't reach.  Trey checking in.  We know Northern Connecticut very well from our past radio lives.  And Rob, hello from Yee-Hoo, Texas. 
[02:32:30]  God damn.  Been listening about a week.  Wow, you've got some catching up to do, Texas.  You really do.  All right, man, what do you got over there that's making you giggle?  Unbelievable.  Wait, wait, yeah, the New Zealand guy.  Send us your number, we'll call you.  Yeah, we want to talk to you.  Send us your phone number.  Ad.  We'll call.  I want to hear that accent.  Give us a call, Ad.  All right.  Opia, 18 kids with 11 women. 
[02:33:00]  Then he's shot dead at 21.  21 years old.  He's got 18 kids with 11 different women.  They show him here a picture.  Let me guess, he's a white guy from Dix Hills?  Oh, so close.  He's a black guy from Birmingham, Alabama.  That's close, though.  Alabama.  And Jesus Christ, this is despicable.  I mean, and the women, too. 
[02:33:30]  I mean, 18 kids, 11 different women.  Something tells me this guy wasn't flipping the bill at all either.  But he got shot on April 3rd by a masked gunman, leaving 11 women to care for the 18 children,  who he named all after his favorite cars.  What are some of the names there today? 
[02:34:00]  Look at the picture.  Oh, yeah.  Him in the coffin.  With his hat.  They're posed.  With his hat on.  With him in the coffin.  Yeah, they're all posing with the kids around.  Look, the little kid's smiling in this one.  All around the coffin of him dead.  He kind of looks like the cube, doesn't he?  Looks like Ice Cube.  He's got his baseball cap on.  He's all dressed in red, so I guess he was a blood.  And shot to death.  He called his name.  His kids have to go.  He's got one kid, a daughter named Mercedes, and another named Infinity. 
[02:34:30]  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  He had to run to the litter.  I call that you goat.  And the mother, very upset.  Yeah, which one?  Isn't there like five or six mothers there?  Mother of this 21-year-old, who's 39, by the way.  She's a 39-year-old grandmother of 18. 
[02:35:00]  It's another friggin' planet.  It's just another planet down there.  Birmingham, crime-ridden Birmingham, Alabama.  Well, I'm sure they could afford to have this many children,  and it's not a burden on the government and taxpayers or anything, Opie.  Yeah.  Look at all the pictures of these kids.  Look at them all.  I see.  What rag is that? 
[02:35:30]  People have got to check it out for themselves.  The National Enquirer.  Okay.  There he is.  George made his living selling cars from his mother's backyard.  Oh.  All right.  He loved them all.  Yeah, right.  This guy is a sperm bank.  He's just a sperm donor.  Unbelievable.  He was selling cars from where?  From his mother's backyard.  He was selling cars. 
[02:36:00]  He was selling cars from his mother's backyard.  Yeah.  It's not a reputable car sales business.  Believe me.  Who else sells cars from their mother's backyard?  Buick.  Buick.  Get over here and wash the windows.  I got to sell this one.  That's pretty good.  Do you want to throw out with a squeegee brush?  Hey, Ian.  Where's my fag son, Miata?  Come here.  Hey, Ian.  The Hanoi Hilton checking in.  Hanoi Hilton.  Yeah, we have a listener from Vietnam checking in. 
[02:36:30]  I am not even going to believe that.  I don't even think there's Internet service over there.  Just stop.  All right.  Let's go to Ian.  Ian, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Yeah, I'm up in Toronto listening.  I actually got a whole bunch of buddies up here listening to you now.  You're listening from Toronto?  Yeah, I'm from Toronto, yeah.  A flathead, Opie.  I lived in Buffalo, and that sounds like the Toronto accent.  Yes.  Yeah.  I've been up there a bunch of times.  Out and about and out.  Yeah, see?  Aboot.  Aboot.  Hey, I might be going up there for my birthday, man. 
[02:37:00]  That's cool.  You were living in Buffalo?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, that was a prison sentence.  Yeah, Buffalo's a crazy town, man.  I was there for three years, and I couldn't wait to leave.  Yeah, that was cool.  Yeah, Toronto's sick, man.  It's got anywhere, guys.  But, yeah.  Yeah, you can't.  I call, you know, like, your show's the best.  A bunch of friends listening up here, and when's your next road trip?  When are you going to do something in local bars down in town?  What, in New York?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We're going to probably do some kind of summer kickoff party. 
[02:37:30]  That's cool, because I was actually at McKay's when you guys were there.  Oh, right on.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, so I'm coming back down in a couple of weeks, so I just want to know if you guys  are doing anything, but...  He's coming back, Dune.  Dune.  Yeah, so just calling to say, you know, love the show, keep up the good work.  All right.  And rock and roll, boys.  All right, thanks, man.  There's Ian, our listener from Toronto.  There he is.  Oh, Canada.  So, yeah, syndication's happening.  Yeah.  We've got 20 listeners all over the country.  I know.  Because only 20 people can listen. 
[02:38:00]  A lot of people asking about the spaz thing tomorrow.  We're going to make it later on in the week.  Yeah.  Give people time to get down here, you know, and make plans for...  Where is the spazmeister today?  He's moving today, Anthony.  Thank you.  It's the stress of moving.  He called me at home and asked if he could take a sick day to move today.  How come he didn't call me?  I don't know.  He doesn't have my home number.  He just doesn't feel close enough to you yet, Anthony.  I don't feel close enough to you.  He moved now? 
[02:38:30]  He's moving an hour and a half from the station.  Don't say that.  No, people are going to know where I live.  An hour and a half?  What do you know?  Draw an hour and a half radius around the...  An hour and a half away?  I got like an hour commute and I hate it.  That's an hour and a half train ride.  Not counting like driving to the train and then walking after...  It's going to be like a...  Oh, he's got an hour and a half train ride?  Yeah.  It's going to be a...  What state did he move to?  Jesus.  It's going to be a two-hour commute each way for him.  Not bad.  Give me time to think and reflect. 
[02:39:00]  So we found out that Spaz is $47,000 in debt.  Yeah.  So we figured we'd try to raise a little money for him.  So we're allowing you guys to abuse Spaz for five bucks a piece.  He's going to be dressed in his Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah, because we found out he went all the way to the top.  What's the top of the Boy Scout thing?  Eagle Scout, maybe?  Uh, fag.  Yeah, he's going to be some kind of an Eagle Scout.  All right, so he's going to...  Or he was, yeah.  He's going to dress up in his little uniform there, his Boy Scout uniform, his Eagle Scout uniform, 
[02:39:30]  whatever the highest is.  Yeah.  And he's going to hold a sign outside the building.  You want to make it Thursday?  Sure.  Let's make it Thursday, Anthony.  Thursday.  All right, so make your plans to join us Thursday outside the building.  Spaz will be in his Cub Scout uniform or whatever it is, Boy Scout.  Mm-hmm.  And he'll be holding a sign, abuse me for five bucks.  Spaz, you hand the five bucks to Rick, and you get to say whatever you want to Spaz.  You just can't touch him.  And it'll go to, what, paying off Spaz's debt?  Of $47,000, yes.  Boy, that really ought to cut it down. 
[02:40:00]  Well, you never know, man.  There's a lot of people that have things to say to Spaz.  Uh, Adam from Glencoe checking in.  I thought Spaz would have wanted to move into the St. Regis.  That's a lot closer.  The commute would have been that.  I'd try to get a room.  All right, let's go to the phones.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you have something.  Corey, what's going on?  Hey, Corey.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Uh, you're on the air.  Yeah, can you guys hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah, long time listening since the, uh... 
[02:40:30]  Okay.  Hey, what's up, Corey?  Hello.  Your phone's all kablooey.  Corey?  Well, there he goes, Opie.  All right.  Uh, so you listen, I guess, to the show, right?  Thank you.  I had a question for you guys.  Oh, there he is.  All right, Corey, let's hear it.  Thank you guys for being good at this, because I've been trying to think...  All right, me and my friends have been...  Uh, Corey, hi. 
[02:41:00]  Hello?  Hi, Corey, what's up?  Okay.  Um, you know when you hang out with, like, a hot girl, and she's always got that ugly friend?  Yeah.  We've talked about that.  You're always like, what the hell?  Why is this hot girl hanging out with this ugly, ugly pig?  Yeah.  What would be a good universal term to use for that girl?  Um, no idea.  I believe you might have the answer, right, Corey?  Uh, no, I don't know yet.  I was hoping you guys could get some listeners, maybe to give me some, uh, some potential ideas. 
[02:41:30]  Ah.  Hmm.  Dead weight?  I don't know.  You tell me.  Dead weight.  All right, someone will come up with something.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Corey.  The one that ruins it.  The one that ruins it.  All right.  Hmm.  Ah.  Uh, the planet Mars checking in.  Listening on the internet.  Mars saying, uh, even we think spaz is a jerk. 
[02:42:00]  Boy, we really do get out there.  All right.  That's an interesting thought, knowing that these radio waves just go out into space, Opie.  Forever and ever.  Never, ever end.  So, like, our voice would just maybe be picked up by some alien race somewhere.  They, too, can enjoy the Opie.  Cut it out, man.  You're freaking me out.  What's the stuff you talk about when you get real high?  Hey, man.  You know, we could be living, our whole, like, universe can be like an atom under a giant's 
[02:42:30]  fingernail.  And, like, we could have whole universes living under our fingernail.  All right.  Cut it out, man.  Can I buy some pot?  Uh.  Call the fat chick the grenade.  The grenade.  Hey, who's your grenade?  That's pretty good, though.  That is pretty good. 
[02:43:00]  Because just like Vietnam, you know, the guys were always, you know, they were jumping on  the grenades to save their butt.  Save their butt.  So if your butt wants to nail the good-looking girl, you've got to throw your body on top of  the grenade, that's called taking one for the team.  That's pretty good.  Every once in a while, you've got to take one for the team.  There you go.  You've got your name.  She's the grenade.  Wait, Ray's got a good one.  Hey, Ray.  Hey, Ray, you're on the air.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You've got a name for the fat chick that hangs out with the hot chick?  Yeah, it's called the naughty.  You've got the hottie, who's the hot chick.  And you've got the naughty, how he is, you know, the ugly. 
[02:43:30]  Who's naughty.  Naughty.  I can't take credit for that, though, because, honestly, it comes from that magazine Maxim.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, that's cool.  But, yeah, so you've always got the hottie, and then you've got the naughty.  The naughty.  All right, I like that.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Great job, man.  Love your show.  Hey, thanks.  How about the sidecar?  The sidecar?  Yeah, you know, motorcycles are, like, cool and slender.  Slender is fun to ride and stuff, and it looks cool.  Yeah.  But once you slap that sidecar on, it becomes ridiculous, and no one wants to ride in a sidecar. 
[02:44:00]  There you go.  All right, very good.  This is indication, slowly.  I'm just reading the instant feedback.  The overweight chick friend is called the goddamn overweight skank piece of crap that makes it impossible to nail the hot one.  A little long, but appropriate, Kevin.  Let's go to Kelly.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hello?  Hi, Kelly.  Hi, is this Opie?  And Anthony, everyone.  I know.  I know Opie's voice.  How are you?  How are you? 
[02:44:30]  Listen, I have something to tell you.  All right, Kelly.  I'm at the devil's game.  Well, actually, I'm in the car to go to the bathroom because I've got to pee real bad.  But, listen, you have to get a truck out here, a wow van, for Wednesday's night's game.  There's a lot of girls to wow, but there's no wow signs.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  I'm serious.  I'm telling you.  That is a great idea.  Everybody's listening to you guys right now.  Well, we're hitting Jersey later on this week.  Oh, God, I hate that noise.  What, her voice or the dentist, Jill?  Yeah, I don't know what's worse.  What?  Nothing, Kelly.  You're a lovely lady. 
[02:45:00]  What did you say?  Did you just abuse me, Anthony?  No.  I didn't hear you.  Oh, my God, no, Kelly.  Anthony, I love you.  What do you think?  I'm married, and I tell my husband also, I love you.  I love you, too, Opie.  Thank you.  We don't abuse people on this show.  Okay, well, I couldn't hear you.  We hit a bump, but I couldn't hear you.  Don't you worry.  Okay.  Okay, but seriously, listen, I'm giving you guys a heads up.  You have to have a wow truck here, okay?  Yeah, we'll figure something out for that game on Wednesday.  What do you mean you're going to be here in Jersey?  We're going to be driving around Jersey to give out the wow stickers by the end of the week, 
[02:45:30]  so we might choose Wednesday so we could, you know, check it out.  Hey, listen, my husband makes wow stickers for everybody.  That's okay.  We like the homemade signs.  You choose things on all the people's vans and everything in New Jersey.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Wow, that didn't take you long to isolate that.  Oh, no, that's a fun one.  I only did that about an hour and a half ago. 
[02:46:00]  You guys are fast.  Hey, play that again.  The new Opie drop.  I could have been a great 80s rock band singer.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I'm a freaking lunatic.  You are.  Can I hear it?  I like it this way better.  Be quiet, sir.  Be quiet, sir.  My brother's on the line.  Does he have a name for the fatty? 
[02:46:30]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Elmo.  Hey, now.  What up?  I just wanted to add my phrase to the lexicon.  Yeah.  The hot girl is known as the statue, and her friend or friends are known as the pigeons.  That's how me and mine describe them.  The statue and the pigeon.  What did Brett say yesterday about the gazelle?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we go out, we look for the weak zebra and try to separate her from the herd. 
[02:47:00]  The weak zebra.  And go in for the kill, you know.  You look at that new foal who's there and not getting the legs yet.  Yeah, the old wobbly legs.  Exactly.  And then you try to corner them in the bar and, you know, buy them shots.  A few of them will try to protect their own for a little while, but when they realize it's futile, they run off and leave the prey.  Yeah, they bolt and they run away onto the savannah and leave the weak one behind for us.  For bachelors like you and me, eh?  Yeah, thanks. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, baby.  Cool, man.  All right, that's it.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  That's my brother.  What is this?  Someone sent it to us.  It's a message board.  There's a message board.  Is this worth even reading?  You know what?  Take a break.  We have to take a break?  We don't like breaking.  Who's going to read this?  What is it?  All right, I'll read it during commercial so we don't bore everyone with that.  It is. 
[02:48:00]  All right, we'll be back.  Stay there.  Hi, this is Jim Brewer, and you're listening to the new FM Talk 1027 NEW, O.P. and Anthony,  and they're part of my new class.  Then we gather every Tuesday of the first month, and we talk about our past lives.  And I used to be a butterfly, and I'm flying away.  Fly, fly, fly.  Read some of it in a minute or two.  I think it's funny.  We got something pretty funny in a second.  But first, Anthony, Fidelity Diamond.  Yes.  Are you in love?  Hmm? 
[02:48:30]  Thinking of taking the plunge into holy matrimony?  Ah!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Opie, don't be so jaded.  If I can have an open mind and realize that people fall in love and plan on getting married,  me jaded?  After listening to what came out of your mouth the last six to eight months,  you think I'm going to be stupid enough to walk down the aisle anytime soon?  Well, if you were stupid enough, you should do something smart.  Two words.  Preen-up.  Well, it's pretty hard to write a prenup when you have tin snips in one hand 
[02:49:00]  and a paycheck of about $150 in the other.  Yeah, baby.  You ain't taking half of my fortune.  I'm a tin knocker.  I'm the best.  I make full fittings out of eight-inch round pipe.  I'm a treasurer in the company.  Preen-up.  She taught you that trade, too?  Sorry.  Sorry.  That's pretty good.  Well, sometimes I should keep these thoughts to myself.  Yeah, Opie. 
[02:49:30]  Maybe I shouldn't blurt out everything that comes in my mind.  You've got to keep yourself in constant mental delay.  Sorry about that.  Punch out before it comes out of your mouth.  I apologize.  That's right.  No, but as far as marriage goes, I've said it a few times on the show.  Yeah.  My wife's not born yet.  He's waiting.  Opie's going to be one of those guys.  Hey, baby, you're a hot tamale.  You think that's crazy, though?  Look at all those celebrities with those, you know, hot pieces of asses.  And they're, like, what, 30 years older than them? 
[02:50:00]  So, realistically, my wife's not born yet.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Well, when you're, uh...  Yeah, I want to bang Placido Domingo's daughter.  Oh, granddaughter.  Where's that playboy?  Yeah.  Oh, are we in the middle of a race?  Well, Opie, when your wife finally is born at some point and goes through the whole thing  with the pacifier, baby clothes, elementary school, junior high, maybe you could take her  to the prom.  Let's put it this way. 
[02:50:30]  I'm hoping Tom Colosino and Fidelity Diamond will still be around when my wife-to-be is of  age to be married.  Oh, my God.  I hope at that point they don't figure out how to turn water to diamonds at some point.  Make your own at home, like incredible edibles when you were a kid.  But, yes, there are people out there that are in love and they need an engagement ring.  Well, no matter if your wedding and marriage is going to be a wonderful thing or a horrible,  horrible thing gone bad, mistake, error in your life, you don't want to start off on 
[02:51:00]  the bad foot.  You must buy your diamond ring from Fidelity Diamond and be an expert.  You can't be an expert in marriage, can you?  But you could be an expert in buying a diamond.  They educate you.  Everything you need to buy a diamond.  You select your diamond loose like you should have selected your woman.  Sure.  And they weigh the diamond in front of you while you watch.  They set it. 
[02:51:30]  It's a beautiful thing.  If only your marriage could last like your Fidelity Diamond ring.  Right?  And if it doesn't, Fidelity is ready to buy your unwanted diamonds, turn them into instant  cash.  Uh, I can't see many guys walking into the store getting this deal.  Something tells me that's 100% women walking in and cashing in the diamonds.  I don't have any.  I can't go to Fidelity Diamond and cashing in any diamonds.  Um, Anthony? 
[02:52:00]  Yes, Opie?  A lot of names coming in for the ugly girl.  Oh, yeah?  Um, Parasite.  Sensitivity Barricade.  Uh, Designated Ugly Friend.  Designated Driver.  And the Gipper.  The Gipper?  Take on for the Gipper.  Oh, take one for the Gipper.  Oh, take one for the Gipper.  Take on.  Yeah, that should be one.  Take one for the Gipper.  Very good, guys.  Thank you for that on phone lines. 
[02:52:30]  Okay, back to Fidelity Diamond, Anthony.  Yes, Fidelity Diamond.  Uh, this is the place to get your diamond engagement ring.  Please.  What are you going to do?  Go to the department store and get taken for a ride?  No.  They educate you.  Uh, you will get, uh, you won't get ripped off.  And it will be a wonderful, wonderful thing at a wonderful, wonderful price.  Give them a call.  201-261-6555.  Make your appointment now.  201-261-6555.  Fidelity Diamond.  And really fast, Fidelity Diamond is proud to host a Wow Sticker Stop tomorrow, Anthony. 
[02:53:00]  So if you're looking for the Whip Them Out Wednesday stickers, Fidelity Diamond will have them tomorrow.  Fidelity Diamond is located on Route 17 South in Paramus.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  I feel stupid.  Oh, so stupid.  I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  Opie and Ed.  We've got a smile on our face and a head up our ass. 
[02:53:30]  1027 WNEW.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  It's the O&A Show.  Anyone else noticing that everyone in New York City using okay, terrific?  Yeah, what's up with that?  Don't even mention the station.  I know, I won't.  You just want us to talk about them.  I absolutely won't.  But it's like, okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  You know, you can't really fault them. 
[02:54:00]  It is becoming like one of those catchphrase things to say.  I hear people say it all the time.  I don't even know who they are or anything.  Like, I'll be somewhere getting something to eat.  And behind me, you hear guys talking.  It's like, okay, terrific.  Kind of funny.  Yeah.  It's out of our hands now, Opie.  And if you're a transvestite and you want to send an autographed, glossy photograph to the Opie and Anthony show,  don't sign it with love.  Each.  Look at that.  Get some weird stuff in the mail.  Sorry, Anthony.  Certainly do. 
[02:54:30]  Um, anyway, we have a new enemy of the show, possibly?  Yeah.  Oh, this is always fun.  I'm just trying to get the site up real quick.  All right.  Forum.  Mm-hmm.  Let me look there.  Do you need to?  Flash.  India.  These people are all mad at us.  We got the Indians mad at us.  Not the cowboy-killing woo-woo Indians.  Not the beaver-pelt-wearing drunks.  No, stop.  Now I'm just being out of hand to get a rise out of everybody. 
[02:55:00]  You understand, right?  I understand, Anthony.  Dot heads is what you're talking about.  Right.  Yes.  Um, yeah, so, uh...  Do you got the website up?  Yeah, I'm trying.  I got this India thing.  I just can't find the link to the, um...  To the forums.  Indian discussion groups.  Boy, that must be just a really full, full website.  They must just get hits all the time. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  I can't find, like, the thing on there.  What is that?  Let me see.  Go down there.  Immigration station.  U.S. immigration.  Well, they're very, very close to their hearts.  Um, anyway, on this, uh, Indian discussion forum message board,  this girl, Shiksa girl, posted a message, very angry.  Uh, everyone who cares anything about racism against South Asian people in America,  listen to this.  I was driving home from school, and on the New York radio station, WNEW-FM, 
[02:56:00]  on a stupid program called the Opie and Anthony Show,  meaning two ignorant jackasses who someone was brain-dead enough to give a radio show to.  Can we use that?  Opie and Anthony, two ignorant jackasses who someone was brain-dead enough to give a radio show to.  That's a great idea.  Write that down for our voice guy, the okay, terrific guy.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Uh, there was a scene going on.  It may still be going on.  For any of you who might live in New York, it's 1027 on your radio dial.  Without going into the whole long story, evidently, one of these two jerks, 
[02:56:30]  either Opie or Anthony, had a difficult time with a Pakistani driver of a car service last night.  That would be Anthony.  Anyway, I did.  With the foulest mouth and calling this man every mother effer and pig name he could come up with.  Wait, I can't use the mother effer word on the air, so that's a lie right there.  I could say mother effer, but the way it's spelled here, it's as if I said it.  Sorry, I can't.  Uh, and pig name he could come up with. 
[02:57:00]  He had a boss of the, uh, car service on the radio complaining about the driver.  The car service boss.  That was, uh, I can't talk today.  That was when you called the car service just to, uh, fill everyone in,  and you waited, what, two hours or something for the car?  Dude, I waited, like, four hours for a car.  All right.  And I had to leave my truck at home, and, uh, uh, it was having its brakes done.  I used the car service to get in.  I had no problem.  I used the car service to get back home and waited four hours,  making multiple phone calls to this company saying, send the goddamn car. 
[02:57:30]  I go, oh, he's there.  I go, no, the idiot isn't here.  This guy jerked me around so bad.  He finally showed up.  I got in the car all pissed off.  He goes, get out of my car.  I go, no, you're taking me home.  Get out.  You're angry.  You're angry.  Get out of my car.  So I was like, get out.  Okay, fine.  I'll get out.  Go F yourself.  I kicked the door.  I was all pissed.  And the next day, you went on a rant.  So I called up the boss of the company.  I said, okay, well, I have to do a radio show in New York and listen tomorrow because your  company is going to get a very nice commercial from us tomorrow for how pissed I am. 
[02:58:00]  And I unloaded.  And the guy informed me that this driver was an idiot and he happens to be a Pakistani.  Well, the limo service boss, yeah, evidently in charge of dispatching, was totally kissing  up to Opie and Anthony and joined them in berating this driver on the air and talking  about how this driver, how in this driving business in the city, we have to work with  those people and say all kinds of ethnic slurs without any fear of repercussions at 
[02:58:30]  all.  It was completely outrageous.  But the straw that broke the camel jockeys, oh, the camel's back, was when one of these  morons asked the car service boss what nationality the driver was.  And he told him, I guess he's Pakistani.  The radio guy screams over the air, I hate all Pakistanis.  All Pakistanis are dirt.  They're all mother effers.  India should drop the bomb on them.  I believe you did say something very similar to that.  You were so pissed.  I said all Pakistanis.  I hate them all.  They are dirt. 
[02:59:00]  They're all mother effers.  And India should drop the bomb on them.  Yeah.  It matches identically to what I said.  Yes.  The limo guy just sat there and let him say all these discriminatory things about the  driver and kept joining it and agreeing.  It was the worst display of overt racial discrimination by a radio program.  I've ever heard in my life.  The Civil Liberties Union, FCC should hang them, blah, blah, blah.  And before any of you Indians out there get too cocky because they said that India should 
[02:59:30]  be dropping the A-bomb.  You should first remember that if this driver had been from India instead of Pakistan, they  would have been saying the same thing about you.  And no, that's not true.  I really hate Pakistanis.  This was a blatant slur against all South Asian people.  So all of you out there should be up in arms and create any stink you can about these two  jerks.  Oh, they do.  Yeah.  They create a stink, all right.  Boy, you sure use the proper terminology. 
[03:00:00]  It's too bad you don't have an Al Sharpton on your side.  He'd be protesting.  Then they'd just go into, like, call the station and complain, call the limo service  and complain, opium Anthony of jerks.  She reiterates that.  That's about it.  Oh, no, this is good, though.  Please take some action in this.  I am appalled for all South Asians, but I'm only one small voice.  And if they only hear mine, it will hold no weight. 
[03:00:30]  Furthermore, all their radio listeners, I'm sure, will now be calling into the radio station  in support of O&A because their idiot listeners, all undereducated, ignorant pigs, simply adore  them.  So these guys will get away with it and actually be praised for it with joking and back-slapping  and everything.  Start the back-slapping.  Please stand up for yourselves and be heard.  And contact any of your relatives in New York to also call and complain about the disgraceful  outrage against the South Asian people in America.  I hope I haven't offended anyone, but I am in shock. 
[03:01:00]  Oh.  All right.  So, new enemy of the show.  What's the website, Anthony?  www.indialink.com.  Indialink.com.  Indialink.com.  There's a forum section.  Rick, how easy was that to get to?  Pretty easy.  Just type in...  I had to type in the entire address.  Oh, you did?  There's no link to it?  That kind of blows.  Yeah, I could...  The discussion forum, you can't even find...  How many hits does that page have? 
[03:01:30]  This is the most pathetic message board I've ever seen.  People, we have to do something about getting the traffic up on this website.  There is about 15 postings on this whole thing, half of which are from this girl that  rags us.  She's pretty much talking to herself through the message board.  Totally.  All right.  All the best is here.  Go back...  What, another one?  Yeah, because now they all discuss...  They give out the phone number of the station?  Yeah.  That's the wrong number.  That's the wrong number? 
[03:02:00]  That's great.  That's smart.  Oh, good.  Oh, that's good.  It's...  That's the car service number.  That's good.  They'll be happy to hear you over there.  Yeah, so they're giving out the phone number of the car service when they think it's the  number of the radio station.  I got a problem with some of the Pakistani people, the guys that drive the cars, the  Pakistanis that drive the cars.  A shower.  It's very hard to get into a car and have people stink. 
[03:02:30]  You could shower in the morning.  It's not against the law here.  Oh.  That's the problem I have.  And the guy was very rude.  Well, that's a long address to give out.  We'll give it to Steve.  Yeah, he could link it and you guys could just fire away.  Fire at...  I'd be happy to hear from you.  Give your opinions.  The indialink.com forum board.  Have fun with it.  All right, let's go to Vish.  Vish, what's going on? 
[03:03:00]  Hey, what's going on?  Is this opening?  Yeah, what's up, Vish?  Hey.  I have no idea where this chick is coming from.  No?  Yeah.  I've been listening to you guys for about two years.  You know what?  You guys are jerks, but it's your funny jerks.  It's funny.  Thank you.  And I have no idea what the heck this chick is talking about.  I love being a funny jerk.  Hey, you know what?  It's all good.  All good.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Vish.  That's pretty much all I have to say.  I don't know what the hell she's talking about.  I don't know where she's coming from.  You know what? 
[03:03:30]  Whatever.  Stop.  Leave it alone.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Bye.  There we go.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  What's up?  Not much.  What did I learn on the Opie and Anthony?  Did you do the show today?  Yeah, why not?  Look at the time.  We could go right to that.  Sure.  I learned that the Dice Man's banana whistles when he shoots his load.  Well.  I didn't know where that came from.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  That fell a little flat.  But the rest of the Dice conversation today was rocked.  Yeah.  It was great.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Steve. 
[03:04:00]  Bye.  That's pretty funny.  Let's see.  Hi, Joe.  What's going on?  What's up?  How are you?  Very good.  Anthony, I got a way of solving your problem.  Anytime these dot-faced ragheads give you any problem, I got something for you, Bubba.  What?  You just let them know that they're a bully.  A bully?  You want to know what it is?  Yeah.  It's your junk.  Oh.  Oh, really?  That, or you can call them a pancho, and that'll drive them bananas. 
[03:04:30]  Well, it's not India.  It's the Pakistanis.  Oh, yeah.  You trust me.  They know 50 languages.  I used to work with a dirty, stinky rat son of a gun.  All right.  Thank you, brother.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to Jason.  We just have a few minutes left.  I'm going to Mike next.  Jason, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm over here now.  What's up?  I learned that the new title of Dice the City is going to be Slap It With Your Yambag.  Slap It With Your Yambags.  Hey, honey.  How's my yambags on your ass?  Over and out, you two farmers. 
[03:05:00]  Farmer.  Farmer.  Thank you, Jason.  Got to thank Dice for calling in today.  That was huge.  Yes.  Absolutely huge.  I want to thank the Entertainment Weekly, I guess, for calling up.  I don't know.  It looks like we're going to be in next week's issue, and it's not going to be pretty.  All right, let's get to Mario.  Mario.  What's up, gentlemen?  How are you, Mario?  Yeah, you know what I learned today?  Yeah.  I learned that Dice is one step closer to finding God. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, that was a little weird.  Oh, no, if that ever happened.  Maybe he'll call the new album out of something.  You know what I mean?  That's the next step.  Could you see Dice doing that?  So, I got to tell you about my new personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  Now, the Lord is our Savior, okay?  Yes, it is.  Now, I went to a period of my life where I was doing things that maybe the Lord didn't like.  You hear me?  But Jesus is over here now, okay? 
[03:06:00]  In my heart.  Jesus is over here now.  It just won't work, man.  And the Lord sayeth to you, stop your evil ways.  Over here.  Over here.  Okay?  I'm over here now.  My disciple, Club Shutter Kenny.  Come here.  Bring the hairy banana.  No more with the hairy banana.  Now it's a cross.  I do my work with a cross. 
[03:06:30]  I'm touring the country, spreading the word to God.  Could you see that?  Oh, my God.  That would be too friggin' surreal.  Yeah, Jesus is over here now.  Over here now.  Oh, Father, who art in heaven.  Oh!  So, well, you know, in the old days, I might have talked about Moses going to the burning bush and added in something dirty. 
[03:07:00]  But it's a beautiful thing.  But it's a beautiful thing, finding God.  Jesus is over here now.  Jesus is over here now.  I'll now read from the book of E.  E.  E.  E.  John 23, 7, 5, 8, 2.  Stoner Matt from Bayonne, New Jersey. 
[03:07:30]  I learned that in the world, according to Dice, everyone with bad karma is coming back as a midget with sausage-linked fingers.  But even the midgets are children of God.  See, what I was saying before was bad.  Just remember the battle cry of the Lord.  Jesus is over here now.  Oh!  We got to get out of here, man. 
[03:08:00]  We got to go.  Okay.  You think when midgets go to heaven, they get small little angel wings?  No, it's not funny.  It's really what I'm thinking.  Jesus, over here now.  I was over there.  Now I'm over here with the Lord.  I don't want to see that, man.  I do not want to see that. 
[03:08:30]  Little angel suits.  Little angel suits on their Tonka toy bodies.  Little angel halo.  It was immaculate conception, Jesus, with Mary.  Mary never felt a yam bag on her ass.  Immaculate.  Get out of here, Rick. 
[03:09:00]  Always over the top, Rick.  I've had it.  We're out of here.  Yeah, we got to go.  We got to go, man.  Jim says real fast, I learned today that O&A are like stacker two for dice.  Yeah, right?  That's pretty good.  You guys, we really got to go.  We're running late again.  All right.  Thanks for checking us out.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, too, all right?  Don and Mike next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This happened to be one of my favorite shows.  It's fun to listen and learn.  I learned that from my ride home, I'm going to wear the pants because I think that your 
[03:09:30]  show is so funny, I'm going to pee myself every day.  Another goal we have, everybody wetting their pants on their drive home.  That's a dumb.  Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?  1027 WNEW. </pre>
