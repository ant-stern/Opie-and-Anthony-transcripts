<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a brief discussion about their intro music, specifically their dislike of the current dubstep track.  Troy Kwan, the show's sound engineer, was briefly brought on-air to discuss creating a new one.  The bulk of the show then centered on a heated debate between Opie and Anthony about the merits of *Spaceballs*, with Opie expressing intense disdain and Anthony defending it. This spurred a wider discussion about movies they considered overrated "classics," including *Dumb and Dumber*, *History of the World Part 1*, and various Batman films, particularly those directed by Joel Schumacher. They dissected specific scenes and actors' performances, focusing heavily on flaws and comedic failures. A caller attempted to interject, but failed to connect with the ongoing conversation. The hosts briefly revisited a previous show's topic before returning to their movie critique, touching on the philosophy of *The Matrix* and its sequels' shortcomings.  The segment concluded with a continued analysis of the various Batman franchises, comparing different actors' portrayals, particularly focusing on the delivery of "I'm Batman" by Michael Keaton and Christian Bale.  The segment ended with Opie sharing a humorous, and inappropriate, anecdote about sitting next to Michael J. Fox on a plane. Jim Norton was present in the studio throughout this segment.

The next segment largely focused on movies, particularly Michael Keaton's filmography, and continued the critical dissection of *Spaceballs*. The hosts watched and sarcastically commented on scenes, employing frequent vulgar language. Their humor relied on the film’s over-the-top nature.  Joseph DeRosa filled in for Opie, who was absent due to a scheduled scrotum surgery. The conversation then shifted to negative airline experiences, specifically with United and American Airlines. Jim Norton recounted a frustrating experience with American Airlines, resulting in an unexpected upgrade and a $1000 voucher.  A news story about a 10-year-old girl left unattended by United Airlines was discussed, highlighting the airlines' poor customer service.  The segment concluded with a detailed, and profane, discussion of a Progressive Insurance case and their allegedly unethical handling of a fatal car accident lawsuit, focusing on the subsequent social media backlash. The segment was characterized by frequent profanity and graphic content.

The following segment continued the discussion of Progressive Insurance’s allegedly unethical practices, with the hosts and a caller, a former Progressive employee, detailing alleged instances of claim manipulation and minimized payouts. This expanded into a broader discussion about corporate greed and lack of accountability, using Chick-fil-A as an example and drawing parallels to everyday poor behavior. The hosts frequently used highly offensive language.  Another caller, a former Progressive employee, provided further insight into the company's practices and state-specific negligence laws, illustrated with comedic and offensive scenarios.  The conversation later shifted to a new sound effect created by Sal for a recurring segment featuring "Roland, the Angry Panda." The sound effect was played and met with overwhelmingly negative reactions, described as "terrible," "douchey," and "hideous."  The segment ended with further criticism of the sound effect and the hosts' frustration.

The subsequent segment featured a phone call with Dr. Steve, embroiled in a Twitter feud with Joe DeRosa.  DeRosa and the hosts heavily criticized Dr. Steve's tweets, using insults and profanity. DeRosa used insults like "prescription writing face" and "tumescent penis." Dr. Steve responded in kind, wishing harm upon DeRosa.  The conversation shifted to DeRosa promoting his Philadelphia shows, mentioning Garfunkel and Oates and the unusual weekday scheduling.  They discussed Garfunkel and Oates' comedy style and briefly reviewed their music video, "Save the Rich".  More insults and banter ensued, culminating in DeRosa expressing frustration. The conversation moved to overrated comedians—John Belushi, Cheech & Chong, and Freddie Prinze—and recollections of Saturday Night Live sketches, including Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and specific sketches like "Samurai Delicatessen" and the Frank Sinatra roundtable. DeRosa concluded by discussing his struggles with anxiety, the impact of drinking, and a costly gambling experience involving a punched chair.

The final segment covered gambling, specifically the difficulty of walking away from a winning streak.  The hosts shared anecdotes, one mentioning using winnings to improve his yard.  The conversation touched on gambling wins feeling like "free money," leading to irresponsible spending.  Listener call-ins followed, and Joe DeRosa again promoted his shows in Philadelphia and New York City. Adam Richman, host of "Man vs. Food," joined, discussing his career, his show’s creation, and his new series, "Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America," including its finale.  He shared details about the challenges of the "Man vs. Food" eating competitions, including a funny audition anecdote. A commercial for Stephen Singer Jewelers, using their slogan "I hate Stephen Singer.com," was played. Troy made several appearances, mentioning giving away his ex-girlfriend and her deceased mother’s belongings, and Opie’s upcoming vasectomy was mentioned.  The show concluded with social media and broadcast time reminders.

I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Just remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road!  All right.  Let's see what I'm doing here.  Hi, everybody!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I was just saying, I want that intro changed so bad.  Look, who doesn't love the Troy Kwan, right?  But, god damn it.  When I can't even put the headphones on for an intro, how do you think people feel waking  up?  They gotta listen to dubstep.  It's so loud and fucking intrusive. 
[00:02:00]  You don't listen to Skrillex when you wake up in the morning?  Skrillex!  Yeah.  No, I don't!  Bang-a-rang.  Bang-a-rang!  Bang-a-rang!  Yeah, bang-a-rang.  Oh!  The kids are all into.  I am so not fucking into, uh, loud noise.  Suddenly young people know that you know what's going on.  It's got, like, that, uh, that sound like a fucking...  I don't know, you've been in a car and, like, somebody pulls up behind you and you just 
[00:02:30]  hear...  It's like that.  It's fucking annoying.  Non-specific bass line.  Change it.  Yeah, I can't stand it.  Here he comes.  Oh, hi, Troy.  There's a new one in the works.  Is there?  Yeah, I'll have it for you next week.  I don't mind, you know, I mean...  Yeah!  Skrillex!  Work-wise, you know, it's good.  But, uh, guys, so, it's just...  No, I know. 
[00:03:00]  Who is this?  Skrillex.  Skrillex?  Skrillex.  What's Skrillex?  Skrillex.  DJ.  Producer.  Bangerang.  What's Bangerang?  Did they sing Cruel Summer in the 80s?  No.  I'm working on a new one.  I'll have it for you next weekend.  All right.  Is there going to be more...  Let's get some dubstep in.  No, it'll be a little dubstep.  I'll make it...  I'll make it...  Oh, it's so loud.  It'll be straightforward.  Why is it called dubstep?  That's Troy's question. 
[00:03:30]  I don't really know.  I don't know.  It's just...  It's at halftime.  It's like, um...  Like 130 BPM cut in half.  So...  Okay.  It just has a lot of wobble bass and...  I don't know either.  It's got wobble bass.  Yeah.  All right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Did that answer your question, Jack?  I don't know why it...  I mean, why is, uh...  House music called House, or why is...  I don't know.  They play it in the house.  You know?  It just...  That's the name.  They play it in a house?  Well, they play it in the house.  You know, the club.  Yeah.  It's in the club, y'all. 
[00:04:00]  In the club.  Should we call it club music?  It really should.  And it is.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you, dude.  All right.  This stupid song's gonna be stuck in my head all day now.  All right.  Hangarang.  Yeah.  You rock, I swear to God.  Thank you.  All right.  Fucking can't even deal with this shit.  Not a dubstep guy.  Not today.  I barely got any sleep.  You know, I don't know why I subject myself to certain things just to make myself mad.  Just to make myself, like...  Like, if someone annoys me, I'll just relish in it. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Now, last night is a prime example.  I could have gotten, like, a couple hours of sleep, you know.  Before the show.  The show.  But Spaceballs was on.  Now, let me tell you something.  If you say Spaceballs makes you mad, I'm gonna walk out of here.  I fucking hate Spaceballs.  You do?  And I tweeted it last night.  Look, maybe you got a different fucking recollection of that piece of shit movie.  It's so bad.  And I didn't realize, I didn't have a revelation last night that it was bad. 
[00:05:00]  I've known it's been bad for years.  And I've had to listen to people crow about that shit movie for years and years and quote it.  It's not a quotable movie.  It's a terrible fucking movie.  Not funny.  It's embarrassingly bad.  No, it is not.  Dude, I put it in the same category, Caddyshack 2.  Oh, stop it.  It's Caddyshack 2, man.  Would you stop it?  Yes, it is.  No, it's not.  It's not funny in the least.  You're just saying this to start a fight so we get off to a good start here today. 
[00:05:30]  You know why?  Look at my Twitter.  You will see that I was lambasting this movie last night.  Now, this is a fascinating subject matter because I love talking about movies that people say are classics that stink.  That suck.  But I don't agree with you about Spaceballs.  Now, how do you not?  Please, enlighten me on why this is a good movie.  Here's the thing with Spaceballs, in my opinion, this is my theory on Spaceballs, is that is right around the time when Mel Brooks fell off. 
[00:06:00]  That was one movie before Life Stinks.  And everybody thinks that, or no, that was one movie before Robin Hood, Men in Titans, or like, I can't remember what, one of those two came after it.  But the point is, is that everybody either thinks that the movie after Spaceballs was his first bad movie or that Spaceballs was.  And I think it's about when you were born.  I was 11 or 12 when I saw Spaceballs, so it's kind of, you know. 
[00:06:30]  Well, that probably would explain it then, because only a child, only a dim-witted child would enjoy this movie.  Here's a prime example.  I'll give you some quotes from the movie.  Yeah.  Jam the radar.  And then they've got to say it like three more times.  We're jamming.  Get it?  The radar.  It's so, they're not even subtle about their dumb jokes. 
[00:07:00]  The jokes are horrible.  But even if they presented it better, it might not be as bad.  They're so, comb the desert.  Did you hear me, everyone?  I said, get this, comb the desert.  Oh, look, they got combs.  It's not funny.  But there's funny parts in it.  No, there isn't.  You're picking the two worst jokes in the movie.  It's funny when it goes...  Those are the ones everyone quotes!  Well, then you're hanging out with the wrong people.  You're hanging out with the...  Today? 
[00:07:30]  Listen, you're calling...  It's funny when he goes, we can't stop.  If we stop, it'll be too dangerous.  That part's funny.  See?  Travis just laughed at that.  Oh, God.  Trust me.  You have two people in this room that completely agree with you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nobody, aside from Anthony, is thinking that Spaceballs is not funny.  What?  It's funny when he goes...  Fucking people hate it!  This is the same guy who enjoyed the reboot of The Three Stooges. 
[00:08:00]  I just said...  Oh, and Bo!  Oh!  Thank you for bringing that up!  I said it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  You motherfucker.  And it wasn't.  You motherfucker.  I bought that on Blind Faith because you...  What the fuck do you buy things for?  Because you and the guy that produces...  What's his name that produces Imus in the morning...  Yeah, yeah.  You both said it was funny, so I bought the fucking thing on Amazon because I wanted to see it. 
[00:08:30]  What happened?  It stinks!  It's fucking terrible!  It's no Spaceballs!  It isn't!  It's...  It stinks!  You don't think that as just a fucking knockoff of The Three Stooges, it wasn't that bad?  I think if it was like an SNL sketch and they were like, we're going to do a Three Stooges sketch,  I'd be like, they did it.  That was pretty funny.  Well, that already is better than fucking Spaceballs.  Why don't we talk about the fucking part in The Three Stooges where they have the sentimental scenes between them 
[00:09:00]  to show that Mo actually loves them and has feelings?  Just go fuck yourselves.  You are right.  I think that was awful.  I didn't say it was a great motion picture with fucking moments of tears and laughter.  I didn't say...  I just think when they fall off roofs and when that whole scene where fucking Larry David was getting creamed at the bottom of the roof  with shit flying off the roof, kind of funny.  I never saw that before. 
[00:09:30]  A sledgehammer in the face is funny to me.  Fucking Spaceballs, on the other hand, not one funny moment.  You know what?  A sledgehammer in your face would be funny to me right now.  I would love it right now.  It would give me some sleep.  You don't think it's funny when they put in the Spaceballs movie?  Look, I really enjoyed the 80 fucking times they referenced that it was a movie.  All right, we get it.  We get it.  You're referencing the fact that you're in a movie.  Ah!  How about once or maybe twice you do that? 
[00:10:00]  The entire fucking movie, they're just constantly making we're in a movie joke.  Really?  It's funny, it's funny when he goes, when he goes, when Michael Winslow keeps doing sound  effects and then Rick Moranis gets mad and starts punching the console because he keeps  doing it.  It's funny, it's funny how mad he gets.  You're fucking saying Michael Winslow, Michael Winslow part is funny?  No, I'm saying Rick Moranis, what Rick Moranis does in that part is funny.  Rick Moranis is funny.  And oh boy, Yogurt, as Yoda, they call him Yogurt, the Schwartz, I can't even say it. 
[00:10:30]  I'm fucking embarrassed saying it.  I'm sitting here and I gotta hide my head.  The Schwartz, shut up.  Oh, is that awful?  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Stop it, you're ruining space balls for me.  I ruined it the second it fucking came out.  Oh, what a waste of fucking celluloid.  Stop it, stop it.  It's terrible.  The Schwartz.  Oh, we get it, he's an over-the-top Jew. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, God.  Now it comes out.  Now it comes out.  That's why he didn't like the movie.  Oh, Mel Brooks stunk in that one.  Oh, God.  He's trying to recapture the moment from fucking Blazing Saddles with the mayor and the fucking  governor.  It's like the same type of character.  When?  The fucking guy from Spaceballs.  The president?  Yeah, that guy.  You think John Candy was funny in it?  Barf.  Oh, I get it.  His name's Barf. 
[00:11:30]  He's half man, half dog.  He's his own best friend.  Oh, come on, Ant.  Oh, fuck that.  You're being too hard on this movie.  Oh, look, his tail is sticking out the back of the uniform.  Look, and then the black guys have an afro pic instead of a comb.  Of course they do.  We get it.  We get it.  It's so bad.  It's so incredibly bad that I was so pissed off that I couldn't stop watching it.  That's how angry it got me.  Look, I'm pissed from a movie.  Yeah, I know.  You're really angry.  I don't like seeing you like this. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, I hate it.  I don't like when you're angry like this at all.  I hear you, Joe.  You're right.  I'll tell you a classic, quote, classic, unquote, comedy that everybody loves that  I've watched over and over and tried to think is funny, and I'm like, there's two parts  that make me laugh, and that's it.  Oh, what is it?  Dumb and Dumber.  Oh, yeah.  I'll agree with you.  I'm not a big fan.  Over and over.  And I love Jim Carrey.  I love Jeff Daniels.  Fairleigh Brothers, Kingpin might be my favorite comedy ever.  And Dumb and Dumber, I literally, I'm like, it's just not that fucking funny. 
[00:12:30]  Not that funny.  I hear you.  Did you see it when it first came out or after?  I saw it in the theater on opening night.  And you didn't think it was funny?  And my friend and I walked out.  My friend and I left, not walked out of the movie.  Walked out.  No, I don't mean like walked out, but I mean after the movie we left, and we went to a  Denny's, and the waitress goes, what did you guys do tonight?  And we went to see Dumb and Dumber, and she goes, oh, how is it?  And my buddy goes, it's exactly what you'd expect. 
[00:13:00]  It's a really, really weak, bad movie that they made so they could have like five scenes  where Jim Carrey's pretty funny in it.  And that's how we looked at it.  We were like, yeah, it's one of those movies where they took like a guy that's really funny  and just like put this shitty movie around him so he could be funny in it.  Like, I never, ever thought it was quality in any sense.  And I've watched it repeatedly because over the years people have said to me, dude, it's  my favorite comedy, and then I watch it, and I go, it's just not that fucking funny.  It's not that funny. 
[00:13:30]  Like, me, myself, and Irene is funnier than that movie.  Kingpin destroys it.  Kingpin kills Dumb and Dumber.  It kills it.  Something about Mary is funnier than Dumb and Dumber.  Something about Mary might be funnier than Dumber.  Three Stooges is dumb funnier than Dumb and Dumber.  Three Stooges, dude, just, I'm not, I'm not fucking taking a heap.  I didn't, I didn't give it a rousing fucking recommendation.  You said it was funny.  I said it was funny.  I said it was funnier than everybody said it was going to be. 
[00:14:00]  You said I suggest everyone go out and buy this.  I did not.  And it wasn't funnier than everybody said.  It was exactly what everybody said.  I was imagining.  And I wasn't even sitting there going like, oh, you know, I bet this is going to be funny.  I sat there like, oh, this is going to suck.  And then I found myself chuckling and chuckling at some parts.  Yeah, there were a couple parts where I laughed, legitimately laughed out loud.  But it was so poorly made.  Like, every time they showed, like, the graphic of the three of them at the top of each story, 
[00:14:30]  where it was supposed to be the throwback to the old one, it looked so shitty.  It literally looked like a 12-year-old made it on Photoshop.  Like, he just cut out Will Sasso's head and put it on this screen.  And they put so little effort into the production value.  Also, I'm watching a Three Stooges movie.  I don't need to hear a pop song that was made in 2010 in the fucking background as they're doing their antics.  It takes me out of it.  It takes me out of it.  And I'm not unwilling to disbelieve that the studio ruined the movie. 
[00:15:00]  Because that fucking movie, they were trying to make that for, like, seven years.  And they had all those great actors attached to it.  And everybody kept walking.  There's a reason they kept walking.  So, I'm sure, like, the studio probably fucked it up.  I'm not going to disagree with you.  But, you know, on the other hand, you like Spaceballs.  So, how can I fucking, how can I take anything you say?  I'm sure there's something you like that stinks.  Oh, I'm sure.  That you...  I understand.  But the thing is...  Well, that's not fun if you just admit to it.  Well, I...  Just to fight me on it. 
[00:15:30]  No.  I'm not going to let people get away with this Spaceballs thing, though.  Because, and this is why, there are plenty of movies that I think stink and shit.  But this movie, for some reason, is beloved by people.  That when you bring up Mel Brooks' movies, and they start talking, you know, you start  talking Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles.  People start going like, oh, how about Spaceballs?  Just because they feel they're obligated to say that it's good.  And it's not, it's a terrible movie.  It's not even not, just not good.  It's a terrible movie. 
[00:16:00]  I'm telling you why.  I'm telling you why.  Because most people saw it when they were 11 or 12.  They had their Star Wars nostalgia on fucking high.  I mean, dude, I saw that movie after Return of the Jedi came out when I thought I was never  going to get to see anything Star Wars ever again.  And then Mel Brooks makes this movie with like fart jokes in it that makes fun of Star Wars.  And I loved it.  But it just...  If I saw it at your age, when you...  How old were you when it came out?  Look...  I don't mean it like that.  I was at an age where I should laugh at fucking juvenile comedy.  I still do.  The thing is, it's not funny. 
[00:16:30]  Even as a kid, it's not funny.  I remember watching it in the movie theater and going like, this...  I wanted it to be funny.  I wanted to laugh at this fucking movie.  And I sat there going like, oh man, I'm not...  And like the forced laughs, you'd hear people like, like, uh-huh.  There wasn't any fucking explosions of laughter in the theater.  Because it's not fucking funny.  It killed when I saw it.  Ugh.  It killed.  What, you fucking... 
[00:17:00]  A retard house?  No!  Because I was in there with kids.  I was in there with a bunch of parents with their kids watching it.  My mom didn't like it.  I remember my...  You were probably my mom's age where it came out.  Oh, crap.  It's terrible.  Now, my buddy is in his 40s.  He's in his mid-40s.  He says the same thing.  He loves Mel Brooks.  He goes, Spaceballs is not a good movie.  He thinks that whatever movie came before Spaceballs was Mel Brooks' last good movie.  Which was what?  Well, there was High Anxiety.  There was... 
[00:17:30]  I think it might have been...  Was it Men in Tights?  No, that was After.  That was After?  All right.  What do we got?  Hold on.  Uh, writer-director was History of the World Part 1 in 81, and then Spaceballs in...  History of the World Part 1, another piece of shit.  What?  Sorry.  Oh, come on!  You're just saying that.  Funnier than Spaceballs, but...  Ant, that is...  Come on, Anthony.  Again, not one of these hilarious movies.  Ant, yes it is. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, God.  Ant, when's the...  Give me a little clip of that.  Find a fucking...  Find a funny clip from History of the World and let me see.  Play the stand-up philosopher scene.  All right.  That's my favorite scene.  Stand-up philosopher.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Stand-up philosopher.  Oh, this isn't it.  No, they're...  Well, they're walking...  They're by the...  This part's funny, though. 
[00:18:30]  Gladiated.  Did you kill last week?  No.  Did you try to kill last week?  That's kind of funny.  All right.  I'm in.  Now, listen.  This is your last week of unemployment insurance.  Either you kill somebody next week or we're going to have to change your status.  You got it?  Yes.  Signed in.  Here comes a classic line coming up right here.  Next.  B. Arthur.  Occupation.  Stand-up philosopher.  What?  Stand-up philosopher. 
[00:19:00]  I coalesce the vapor of human experience into a viable and logical comprehension.  Oh.  A bullshit artist.  Did you bullshit last week?  All right.  I'm laughing.  Maybe.  I'm willing to say perhaps I was in error on that one.  All right.  But I did watch fucking Spaceballs and it sucked ass.  So I'm not taking that back. 
[00:19:30]  Listen.  Yeah.  Let's talk about other...  Let's talk about other...  Let me mention a movie.  It doesn't necessarily have to be comedy, but a movie that I was watching yesterday where  it was a good movie and they just ruined the fucking franchise.  No surprises here.  I mean, people remember.  The Matrix.  When I was watching the fucking Matrix and the first one, right from the beginning, Trinity's  badass, just killing fucking cops. 
[00:20:00]  It was a good movie.  And then they change it to this sentimental, faggotry, fucking crap movie with all this  fucking mumbo-jumbo.  Oh, the rest of those stink.  And it stinks more when you see how good The Matrix, the original Matrix was.  Fuck The Matrix.  It can suck my fucking digital dick.  Even the first one?  Uh...  I'll go through the first one.  I like the first one.  It's just...  Here's what bothers me about The Matrix.  As soon as that came out, everybody thought it was like that they were like smart because 
[00:20:30]  they saw one Wachowski Brothers interview where they explained the philosophies it was  based on.  Right.  And every fucking nerd that saw it was like, you know it's better than Star Wars because  it was based on these philosophies.  Well, so was Star Wars, douchebag.  But Lucas didn't have to jerk his cock in every fucking interview he did.  There you go.  Because he was too busy making a goddamn fucking Enterprise.  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry.  An empire.  Excuse me.  It's just...  Shut the fuck up. 
[00:21:00]  Well, Neo stands for Christ.  Does he?  Does he?  Is that why he dies like this with his arms outstretched?  Go fuck yourselves.  We're very angry at movies this morning.  I just...  I like the original.  But man, though really you're having a rave in the cave there?  A big fucking smelly sweaty rave?  That was like the collective, huh?  It stunk.  What the fuck was that about?  Get back to fucking the agents chasing you and shooting people. 
[00:21:30]  I'm so glad I never saw the two that they filmed after The Matrix.  Oh, you didn't?  Because everybody just told me that they were terrible.  So I have this, you know, I have this nice memory of The Matrix that so few people have.  Yeah.  And I have no interest in seeing the other two because everybody says they're complete shit.  Terrible.  The second one had moments that were awesome because of the action, but the story...  I didn't give a rat's ass.  I was just like sitting in the theater going, I don't fucking care.  Really?  The original?  No, the second one. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, the second one.  Oh, the second one's a fucking...  That one's just nothing.  That could just be taken right out of the mix with the yabino shitheads and fucking...  I don't even know what the fuck.  And just...  And the third one, all right.  And by the way...  Some pretty cool action, but...  Yeah, and by the way, if you're going to sit there and fucking go, uh, uh, listen,  here's the deal.  These machines, uh, they have us all connected to these machines, and, uh, if you take this  pill, you can realize that the normal, like, good life we're living is not real. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And then you can just be awake in this fucking rainy cave and, uh, and then have to worry  constantly, give yourself ulcers and cancer because these machines are going to descend  on us at any minute.  Or you can just stay plugged into this machine.  It doesn't fucking matter.  What are the stakes of them pulling themselves out of the machine?  The machines aren't going to end them.  The machines don't have a problem with their existence within this virtual reality.  What is the problem with living in that virtual reality?  Other than, well, we're being controlled.  Yeah, but the machines made it better for you. 
[00:23:00]  Do you understand that?  Do you want to live in this fucking, fucking stony apocalypse world that you're living in?  I never thought of it like that, Joe.  It's ridiculous.  So you're saying that it's a good thing to be plugged in and, and just live your virtual,  uh, life.  When I saw the first movie and there's that scene with John, Joey Pantoliani or whatever  the fuck his name is.  And Joey Paines.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The informer.  Yeah.  And he's eaten the informer in every movie.  In everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just a terrible person.  We need a rat. 
[00:23:30]  I'll do it.  Fucking poor man's Bruno Kirby.  Wow.  Yeah.  He really is.  Bruno Kirby was a poor man's Joe Pesci.  So fucking, it just fucking, that scene where in the first one where he's eating the steak  and he's got the cigar and he goes, as I eat this steak and I drink this cigar, ignorance  is bliss.  Yeah.  Like when I was watching the movie first, I was like, he's right.  I'm in with this guy.  What does he do?  He's right.  He wanted to be fucking important. 
[00:24:00]  He doesn't exist in this virtual casino we've created for you.  Yeah.  Whereas in this real world, you have to buy things with rocks.  No free will though.  For, to do what?  Who cares?  You're right.  Walk around some stony apocalypse.  I gotta agree with you there, Joe.  That's a good one.  Here's, here's, here's your choice, Ant.  You're plugging into a machine and it, and we're in this room and we can leave and go 
[00:24:30]  maybe get laid or go get drunk or smoke a cigarette or eat a steak or we'll unplug you and you live  in Fraggle Rock.  And just, and have these holes down your spine that would make me woozy, nauseous and vomit  thinking about them.  I'd get all faint.  I know.  I'd put my finger in one and be like, ew, I'm woozy.  Oh yeah, you finally, the fuck Trinity and you got a fucking, can I get it?  Can I get a third finger in your back bolt?  Your back bolt.  Yeah, really. 
[00:25:00]  You're diddling her and fucking, you're giving her the shocker in her back.  Yeah.  Some rusty pussy fucking, oh, it's disgusting.  I never realized that like one of the options to watching the movie and thinking about it  was, uh, yeah, why don't they just fucking accept it?  There's not, cause it's, cause in, in Star Wars.  It's like, well, there's this oppressive thing that in, in our actual reality that is going  to kill us.  That's going to end us.  It's going to take away our freedoms and we will be very aware of it in that movie. 
[00:25:30]  It's like, but you're, you're not free, but you're unaware of it.  So it's like the fucking, yeah, uh, it's, I don't know.  There's some cliche to throw in the mix.  It's too early.  I can't think of it.  It's hard to think of a cliche.  Um, you know what?  I never take calls, but, uh, yeah.  Let's go down from line one.  Fuck it.  Line one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see what Mike, Mike.  Yeah.  What's up boys?  What's happening, man? 
[00:26:00]  Mike.  Hey.  I just, I gotta know, uh, Anthony, you don't find that the scene at the, in space ball funny  when that guy's like chest explodes and that thing comes out and starts singing.  Oh, uh, the alien goof where they goofed on that and the thing comes out and starts singing  like Michigan J frog or something.  Yeah.  And what about the part where, uh, they catch their stunt doubles?  That shit's hilarious.  I think he's being sarcastic, Ant.  I hope so.  I think he is.  Oh, yeah.  Hello, my baby. 
[00:26:30]  Hello, my baby.  They actually got John Hurt to do it, though.  Oh, my God.  They did.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, hey, guys, I don't want to harp on this thing you guys were talking about yesterday  where, uh, you're talking about how you just, people were just dying at random, where random  people are just getting killed, you're being killed off.  How about this one where you order a pizza, they deliver it to your house.  This is why I just don't, uh, say I don't take fucking, uh, calls to tell you the truth.  I know what he's getting at.  He's getting at what we talked about yesterday, about the government just killing you out of 
[00:27:00]  nowhere, and that would be a threat.  But it's like, that was yesterday.  That was yesterday!  The callers you're supposed to call in and talk about today.  Oh, God!  Why don't you take phone calls?  All he had to do was tie it into the Matrix thing, and he might have gotten away with it.  Exactly, right?  That's not even...  All right, thank you.  Thank you, Mike.  That's not even what he told the screener he was going to talk about.  He gets...  Ah, God.  Fucking...  By the way...  Fuck you, callers.  And by the way, uh, Jimmy James and another Mike are waiting on there.  I'm not taking their calls.  That guy...  That guy just fucked you. 
[00:27:30]  I was gonna...  I was gonna run down the phones and make it a little more listener-friendly today with some phone  calls, but that fucking...  One guy wrecked it for you guys by trying to tie in something that happened 24 hours ago.  That's seven years in showtime.  In fucking radio showtime yesterday.  He doesn't explain what he's talking about, first of all.  No.  He just...  You know, yesterday, pizza blows up and...  What?  I don't know.  Why do I try?  I don't know.  I don't know, Ant.  Well, we were discussing. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  We were discussing how...  You broke up the momentum.  I don't know how fun it would be.  Yeah.  How fun it would be if the government just chose to kill somebody randomly every day.  Oh, like some...  In a weird, fucking horrible way.  Like a Hunger Games kind of thing?  Exactly.  Except it was the whole world.  But every day and for no reason.  All right.  I'm into that.  Yeah.  And you don't have to kill each other.  Like, there's no fighting amongst each other.  Now, reiterating it today, it just sounds stupid.  It doesn't make any sense.  It made sense yesterday.  We did it.  Now, who cares?  Plus, it's the same time as we did it yesterday. 
[00:28:30]  So, it's like people who just listen now are going to be like,  what, are we going to talk about this every day?  I hate this guy.  Whoa, whoa, you're going to do it all day.  You're going to do it all day.  Well, yeah.  Can we talk more about the movies?  Please.  I'm thoroughly enjoying this.  That's what we were going on.  I like a good movie break.  George, I watched Batman Forever the other day, and I could...  Wait, Batman and Robin or Batman Forever?  Batman Forever with the Riddler and Two-Face.  Horrific.  I've forgotten how horribly Joel...  Joel Schumacher ruined the whole franchise. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He completely fucked everything up.  It's so funny.  When those two movies came out, and we were...  I was still in college.  We were all bitching about, like,  ruin this fucking Batman franchise.  God damn it.  And my friend Aaron was the only guy familiar with Joel Schumacher,  and he just goes, I don't know what anybody expected.  They get this big gay guy to direct Batman movies.  Oh, that was the one with Jim Carrey.  Right.  I mean, and you look back now, especially with the Batmans that we have now, 
[00:29:30]  and you look at Two-Face in The Dark Knight versus Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face.  Dude, it's...  And, dude, Batman Returns stunk.  And I'm a huge Danny DeVito fan, a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  And, uh, but it stunk.  It's his...  Tim Burton's...  Technically, the original Batman movie with, uh, Keaton...  Yeah.  ...is not...  If you're gonna judge it by, like, the comic book standard, it is not very good. 
[00:30:00]  There's a lot of poor shit that he threw in there.  Tim Burton takes a lot of liberties with...  Uh-huh.  It's a good movie, though.  Yeah, it's not a bad movie.  Batman Returns is...  It's bad.  Like, like, the penguins that drag the body into the water, and the penguins that come  out with rockets on their back.  Terrible.  The cats chew Michelle Pfeiffer's fingers, and then all of a sudden she has cat power.  It's like...  It makes no sense.  Tim Burton didn't even like that movie.  Oh, I am looking at Jim Carrey as the Riddler here, and just douching, douching out. 
[00:30:30]  I watched this movie.  I had no idea.  The Riddler is gay.  Yeah.  Like, he's a gay guy.  If you watch the movie again, he's definitely gay.  Like, even before he turns into the Riddler, he's just got pictures of Bruce Wayne all  over his house.  He's obsessed with him.  Oh, he's obsessed.  He wears a glittery...  That's the other thing, too.  The Riddler is not the Joker, and neither is Two-Face, and Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey  both played those characters like the Joker.  They're always laughing, and it's all maniacal, and they're crazy, and it's like...  And you know it's going to be bad, because the movie starts with Batman getting into his 
[00:31:00]  Batmobile, and it has to be the cute, funny movie trailer line with Alfred saying,  Do you want a sandwich?  And Batman's first line in the movie is, as he's standing next to the Batmobile, I'll  get drive-thru.  Ugh.  And he's just like, oh, this is where we're going with this.  That is hilarious.  It's not hilarious.  It's right there with, let's jam the radar.  Ah, Joe. 
[00:31:30]  It's it.  Jesus, Joe.  It's it.  Ah, Jesus Christ, Joe.  Jesus Christ, Joe.  Ah, what the fuck are you doing, Joe?  Facebook's a classic.  Ah, fuck it.  Yeah, it's wrong with Jim the radar.  Ah, no, it's fucking hilarious.  Let's calm the desert.  Jesus, Joe.  Ah, Jim Norton is here with us.  I'm enjoying this discussion, because I just saw that was on the other day, the Michelle  Pfeiffer.  I watched part of it, and it fucking stinks.  It stinks, right?  Oh, terrible.  Good, good, good.  Yeah.  Terrible fucking...  Who's the Ivy Lady standing in the ivy?  The plants that were showing that? 
[00:32:00]  Poison Ivy.  Poison Ivy.  Poison Ivy, oh, who was that?  That was Uma Thurman.  Uma Thurman.  That was Batman and Robin, with Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.  Oh, God, yes!  Ugh.  Fat Alicia Silverstone.  That's a fat one.  When she was all fat.  Right before she started feeding her baby out of her mouth.  Yeah.  It's just fucking...  It's just fucking terrible.  And that's it, like, Bane is, like, a real villain in this new Batman, and in Batman  and Robin, he's just a doofus in a wrestling mask. 
[00:32:30]  Was he, like, a flunky?  He can't talk.  He's just Poison Ivy's lackey.  Did you like the new one?  Oh, you did.  I hated it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he had the...  That's right.  At the cellar, me and Keith were fucking teamed up on DeRosa.  Oh, really?  For liking the new one?  Yeah.  It's one of the few times I agreed with Keith.  Yeah, he actually...  Joe liked it.  We didn't like the new one.  I liked the new one.  The funniest part of that tragedy was when Keith goes, Bane stunk!  Bane!  Bane's Bobby Kelly!  I'm sick of Bane!  And Jim started covering his face and doing Bane, Bobby, Kelly. 
[00:33:00]  It was so fucking funny.  Bane, Bobby, Kelly!  Oh, my God.  That was killing me.  He is fucking Bobby.  Big fatso.  Yeah, I didn't like it.  I know you did, but I thought it was terrible.  It bored me.  The story was unbelievable.  I really liked it.  But did you like...  I can't remember if we were talking about this.  Did you like Batman Begins?  No, it bored me, too.  It was okay.  The second one was a fucking...  Ledger was masterful.  It was masterful, the second one, but...  The first one was decent. 
[00:33:30]  The second one was amazing.  And the third one, I hated Michael Caine in it.  And I love Michael Caine.  Right.  But just blubbering through the whole movie.  Just meepy Alfred.  Yeah, I felt like I let you down.  Go fuck yourself.  I didn't need that speech.  I wasn't in that frame of...  Like, we knew he was going to get out of the jail.  There was nothing about it to keep me interested.  Really?  Yeah, I didn't care that he was in this dumb jail and he had to climb out.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were all yelling some dumb climb out chant. 
[00:34:00]  That was...  That was...  But that was...  That was an interpretation...  That was an interpretation of the Lazarus Pit, which I thought was really cool.  Because in the comics, Ra's al Ghul is literally immortal.  And the way he's always reborn is he has this thing called the Lazarus Pit that he goes into  and he's reborn out of it.  And I liked the interpretation they did of that, where the Lazarus Pit was this thing  that he had to climb out of in order to live or whatever.  Jesus Christ, Joe.  You're making us feel stupid.  Where were you when the movie was playing?  They ought to hire DeRosa to sit in the audience and tell everybody this. 
[00:34:30]  I might have respected that a bit more if I had you with me.  But I think it's safe to say that you probably weren't a fan, a big fan of the trilogy.  It was more you were a fan of Heath Ledger's performance in the second one.  And that's really what you locked on to.  Because Kurt Metzger and I were talking and Kurt goes...  He goes, by movie standards, the third movie is better than the second one.  It's just Heath Ledger's performance is so good in the second one that everybody thinks  that's a better movie. 
[00:35:00]  I don't even think the third one's that good, though, because the storyline for the third  one was the police get locked underground because he makes something blow up.  That was pretty fucking stupid.  Don't walk out on the ice.  It just, you know, maybe it was well acted, but it just, I didn't care about what was  happening.  I just didn't give a shit.  That was kind of lame, that whole fucking cops locked down there.  Yeah!  Joker's blown up a hospital.  He fucking kills the guy's chick.  There was a lot of very personal stuff there.  But the underlying Occupy message of this movie annoyed me. 
[00:35:30]  It was insultingly simple.  Yeah, we get it.  The rich people are bad.  We get it.  But I thought they muddied that argument in a good way where they made it look a little,  where they were like, no, it's not that rich people are bad.  All these people have turned on Bruce Wayne, but Bruce Wayne actually ends up being their  savior.  Yeah.  I thought that was kind of cool that it wasn't completely one-sided.  But I also thought, the thing I liked about it was I think they did a lot of metaphor,  metaphorical, I don't know if that's a word, stuff with the movie in the sense that they 
[00:36:00]  made it where it was like, where the story came to a close with Batman literally saving  Gotham.  They put Gotham in a state where Batman had to come back and literally free them in like  a prisoner sense and not just were being held captive figuratively by criminals or whatever.  So I liked that.  But didn't he free them in the second one too?  How many times is he going to do the same fucking job for these shitty people?  What's he supposed to do?  They're terrible.  The people at Gotham stink.  Is he supposed to paint a water tower? 
[00:36:30]  He's fucking Batman.  He's got to save the fucking...  I get it.  What's he supposed to clean up trash?  He was a man doing the metaphor of a woman crying.  It drove me nuts.  He hated it.  This looks terrible too.  Batman and Robin?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This might be the worst three minutes of film.  I'm telling you.  What is this one?  It looks terrible.  This is the Schwarzenegger one.  It looks like the TV series.  Who is this?  Chris O'Donnell and who else?  This is with Bane and George Clooney.  And the nipples that they put on the fucking costume. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, the nipple costume.  This is the one where Mr. Freeze, which is Arnold Schwarzenegger, comes out and tells  everybody to chill.  That's fine.  That's Bane.  That's Bane?  Turn that up.  I've got to hear this.  It's so bad.  He's kicking him and punching him.  He doesn't even talk.  He just goes...  He is wearing a wrestling mask.  Yeah.  This looks like somebody Sam would want a picture with.  He has a dumb fucking... 
[00:37:30]  A dumb, like, tube on the back of his hat.  Yeah.  Oh.  Who's that?  That's Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy.  They really tried to make this like the TV show version.  Yeah.  Dude, it's so bad.  It's so corny.  It is corny.  Catchphrase-y.  Yeah, like, I can watch the Adam West movie because that's what it is.  It's supposed to be a goof.  You know?  Yeah.  But not this.  I love that old TV series.  I love it.  But this, like, the color looks fucking weird.  Look at this.  Joel Schumacher takes it over.  There's a giant ice cream cone.  Of course.  There's nipples on the costumes. 
[00:38:00]  Nipples.  Fuck it.  Oh, God.  I would have made Pete a big, muscly guy.  And then Val Comer one where he puts on his new Batman suit.  There's close-ups on each part of the suit.  And there's giant close-ups of his crotch and ass.  Like, you're just like, there's the Batman logo.  There's the mask.  There's his dick and balls.  Joel, what do you think the Batman series is missing?  Pink.  Lots of pink.  Yeah, the colors are kind of weird in this.  Very bright. 
[00:38:30]  This is more towards the old TV show.  Yeah, the weird shadows.  Will Batman save Gotham?  Look at that stupid Bane hand.  Bane is stupid in this.  And I love that the only two people that stayed in the series were the guy who played Gordon  and the guy who played Alfred.  Were the only two that were like, yeah.  Yeah, might as well.  I'll write it out.  There's Mr. Freeze.  Oh, chill.  I don't think I ever saw this one.  It's so utterly bad.  You should watch it just to get upset. 
[00:39:00]  That's what I did last night with Spaceballs.  Oh, there's Mr. Freeze.  I own this because I bought the four.  You know when you get the foreign one?  Yeah.  I got that.  Can't blame me.  I didn't tell you to buy it.  He's just kicking them down the steps now.  And Mr. Freeze is one of the coolest fucking villains ever.  And I mean, this is an atrocity what they did to it.  Coolest villains.  Oh, that's a good one.  You should write for the fucking movie.  That was an accident.  It just comes out of me. 
[00:39:30]  Right with the poison ivy blowing shit.  He just goes around blowing shit in people's face.  He actually looks like Robin, though, in the face.  He actually looks like Burt Ward.  Yeah.  How does he keep that mask on?  I don't get that.  How does he keep it on with cum?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is awful.  I want to see Schwarzenegger.  I would think he'd be a good choice for a villain in this, but.  No, he's just stiff and dumb.  Okay.  Did you ever see The Terminator?  That's fucking good.  Well, yeah. 
[00:40:00]  He would have been cool if they did Freeze the way Freeze is supposed to.  Like, Freeze is a very, like, sort of ominous, like, menacing.  He's very cryptic and, like, calculated.  And he's a cool fucking villain, man.  And they made him this goofball.  Oh, it's so real.  Who is better than Heath Ledger's The Show?  Ah, there it is.  That's the Batman fucking looking at all his parts.  Yeah.  That might be the best villain in a movie ever.  Like, that's something with, like, Darth Vader.  You know what I mean?  It's even better than Darth Vader.  Oh, terrible. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, God.  He's showing his ass in his dick.  Oh, my God.  This is so gay.  This is so gay.  This is too bad.  Oh, they're pulling the pants up.  Oh, man.  That fucking Loverboy album cover shot.  I'm afraid that my condition has left me cold.  These are all his bad clothes.  The Iceman coming.  In this universe, there's only one absolute. 
[00:41:00]  Everything freezes.  You're not sending me to the cooler.  What killed the dinosaurs?  The Ice Age.  Oh, God.  You feel it coming?  The icy cold of space.  Is he just winging this?  Is there a script, or is he just...  The icy two more plummet back together.  I just wing it.  Stay cool, bird boy.  Freeze Chipperson.  Can you be cold, Batman?  You have 11 minutes to saw the bird. 
[00:41:30]  Batman.  I'm freezing.  I'm feeling hot.  I find that unlikely.  What do you say we heat things up?  My passion thaws for my bride alone.  Ooh.  What?  Talk about your coat.  Who's that?  Vivica A. Fox?  Oh, right.  Okay.  Vivica.  Unless the city powers for my demands.  It's winter fiver here in Gotham.  What?  You can't even understand what he's saying.  I hate when people talk during the movie.  Ah, that's funny.  All right, everyone. 
[00:42:00]  One, two.  Ah.  Ah, Chip liked it.  Fucking home run freeze.  Jesus.  I'm on dust.  Yeah.  Designed to heat amidst blood.  It doesn't work on a court hearted.  Now, if you please.  Cool party.  Ah.  We have another two minutes.  I know.  Enough of this.  I've had it with him.  I know I'm in the minority, but I'm actually enjoying Arnold.  The shitty writing isn't his fault.  He's awful.  I like him as freeze. 
[00:42:30]  I do, but the shitty writing is not his fault.  The punny writing is not his fault.  Look at this.  Look at the way they got the guy dressed in jail.  Yeah.  Did you see that?  Jail stripes like the old days.  Did you see?  This is like a throwback to the old show, though.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it's...  That's what they were trying to do.  I mean, you saw the shot of Robin literally frozen in...  You know, it's like they were trying to make it real comic book-y.  Because they were like, well, the Burton stuff was too dark.  Everyone...  But it was the same, like, storyline, so it didn't make any sense.  Every time they have a fucking Batman thing, it's like, oh, that was too dark. 
[00:43:00]  And then they go back to this, and they're like, we want to take it back to dark where  it was.  It's fucking...  This stinks.  That fucking line in Batman Returns makes me want to puke.  Which one?  When Michelle Pfeiffer goes, you know, what is it about you?  Or something about, like, how he's Batman sexy, and he goes, uh, is it the car?  Chicks dig the car.  Yeah.  That's another one of those movie trailer lines.  They just put it in.  Was that Michael Keaton, or is that...  That was Keaton, yeah.  That's...  Oh, that movie sucks. 
[00:43:30]  That's terrible.  But Batman Returns is better than either of the Joe Schumacher movies.  Yeah, but that's like saying, you know...  I mean, you know, that's like saying, uh...  Back to the Future 2 is definitely better than Back to the Future 3.  Yeah, no shit.  Back to the Future 2 is on my flight.  Huh?  Michael J. Fox on my flight.  Oh, he was?  Did you meet him?  Well, I've met him before.  I said hello, but that was it.  Is he, like, the nicest?  He seems to be the nicest.  And he sleeps like a rock.  I went to piss.  I was like, I wonder what it's like for Michael J. Fox to sleep out like a light and fucking 
[00:44:00]  not moving.  Really?  Yeah.  He sleeps better than fucking...  He must love sleep.  Yeah, man.  He sleeps better than any of us do.  Fuck, he didn't move for fucking four hours.  I'd love to meet that guy.  Does that frustrate you that he has Parkinson's and he sleeps better than you?  I fucking laid there wide awake with my mouthpiece in, staring.  There was a girl next to me in the middle seat, and I really did think, because she was  asleep with her face kind of facing me, and I'm like, how much trouble would I get in  if I just stood up and rubbed my dick on her lips?  Like, how much trouble?  A lot, I bet. 
[00:44:30]  A heap.  Wow, that's...  Just that you think that is great.  I think everybody, every guy would think that if they saw that pretty face there, yeah.  And her mouth was open a little?  No, just kind of...  No, lips were closed, but it was just a pretty little percy lip.  You just start kissing her?  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  She'd freak out screaming.  Oh, my God.  Hit you.  Comic arrested on a flight.  What's creepier?  What would be creepier, rubbing your dick on her lips or just slowly kissing her as she  was asleep?  I don't know what would be creepier.  She'd probably freak out about the dick more.  The slowly kissing is probably creepier, but... 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She'd freak out about the dick.  The dick can be interpreted as a joke.  But the kissing is really sick.  I was goofing.  It was a goof.  I rubbed my yam bag on her lips.  She was asking for it.  Do you think Val was a bad Batman?  You know, it's like you were saying about Schwarzenegger.  Val Kimmer's a good actor, so it can only get as good as the writing, you know what  I mean, or as bad as the...  You know what I mean?  So it's like he did the best he could with everything. 
[00:45:30]  I thought he was a decent Bruce Wayne, but it was still just so shittily fucking written  that it's like hard to get around that.  Christian Val's a great Bruce Wayne.  He's just a shit Batman.  I think he's a good Batman.  Terrible voice.  A little kid voice.  You don't like the voice?  Well, people of Gotham need closure.  Shut up.  Oh, that's right.  We don't know it's you because your voice is growling.  Because he talks like this.  Hey.  Where is she?  Come on.  That stinks. 
[00:46:00]  But he's great as Bruce Wayne.  He's a great actor.  He's a great Bruce Wayne.  I don't like that dumb choice he's made to make the voice.  Do you think it was him?  Of course.  Yeah?  Oh, God, yeah.  It is an extreme choice.  I thought Keaton did a good job with the voice where he sounded different enough.  I don't remember.  How did he sound as Batman?  I don't remember.  He just kind of sounded like Michael Keaton, just a little gravelly, and he dropped his voice  down a little.  He did what Christian Bale does, but he did it way, like, ten degrees less.  Better than that, yeah.  So you were like, alright, if nobody knew who he was, or you only talked to him once, 
[00:46:30]  you wouldn't think, oh, that's Bruce Wayne.  Well, that whole concept, of course, it's been done a thousand times, but it's ridiculous  to even think, like, that you'd have to disguise the voice because you wouldn't be able to  notice that it's the fucking mouth.  Even, like, the girls that are interested in Bruce Wayne, they see Batman and start talking  to him, and they don't realize, like, the mouth is the same fucking mouth.  Eyes are the same.  Right.  So fuck, why change the voice around then?  Why have him talk like this?  I'm mysterious.  Is that, oh, let's hear what he sounds like as, uh, what Michael Keaton did with it. 
[00:47:00]  Kill me!  Don't kill me, man!  This is Michael Keaton versus Christian Bale.  Don't kill me, man!  I'm not going to kill you.  I want you to do me a favor.  I want you to tell all your friends about me.  What are you?  I'm Batman.  The first are awesome.  Huh?  I hated that moment in that movie.  Why?  That weak moment.  That weak pauses, Travis.  That was in the trailer, I think.  Of course.  I'm Batman.  No, that's the best part of the movie. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, that's great.  Oh, I hated the way he delivered that.  Who are you?  I'm Batman.  I'm Batman.  I'm Batman, you.  I'm a string of Batmobiles.  I'm Batman, you.  I hate, I've always hated that.  I'm Batman.  That got a huge cheer when I was in the theater, when I was a kid and I saw it.  Oh, God.  You and the dumb fucking people you went to the movies with.  Exactly.  Space balls.  We hear that line again.  They're roaring at the fucking hilarious jokes in space balls. 
[00:48:00]  I never saw it.  It's terrible.  Don't kill me, man!  Don't kill me!  Don't kill me, man!  I'm not going to kill you.  I want you to do me a favor.  I want you to tell all your friends about me.  What are you?  I'm Batman.  That part's awesome!  Yeah, it's awesome.  I'm Batman.  Fucking meek voice.  And away we go.  No!  Oh, oh, oh.  What?  No, it's just Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  It's the same line.  It's a throwback to it.  What the hell are you? 
[00:48:30]  I'm Batman.  Ew.  That was actually better.  You liked that one better?  I don't like his lip the way he does it.  Elvis was like, oh, man.  No, he did kind of.  He did do a weird thing with his mouth there.  He curls his lip up.  I'm Batman.  Ew, I'm Batman.  The top lip always lifts up.  He made the Sam taking a picture mouth.  He's doing that so his lips look different when he talks.  He's just doing a better acting job. 
[00:49:00]  I just don't like it.  I'm Batman.  That's stupid.  Watch his dumb lip whenever he does Batman.  We have to think the jewelers are going to get us again.  This fucking dumb lip.  This dumb lip.  That bugs me.  You don't like that, huh?  No, I don't.  You shouldn't either.  No, I don't.  I wouldn't.  I remember when we heard that Michael Keaton was going to be Batman, everybody was  like, is it going to be a comedy?  I don't understand.  It was so confusing.  He was the funny guy.  He pulled it off.  That's all he did.  It was funny movies.  He's good. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  He's a great actor.  He's probably second to Christian Bale as far as Batman's go.  That's a rough thing to do.  I would put him on par.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I would put him on par.  He just was in, unfortunately, worst Batman movies.  That's a hard thing to do, to go from being a comedy guy to serious role guy.  It is.  Oh, Jimmy.  But he pulled it off, I think.  And then he just disappeared.  He just dropped off the face of the earth.  Some guys pull it off, and some guys don't, Ant, is what I find. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  Is that some guys can make that transition.  Right.  Whereas other men.  Cannot.  Cannot.  He'd have to go back to comedy after that, though, because that's when he did multiplicity and  stuff like that.  Well, I like multiplicity.  What?  You don't like Dumb and Dumber, but you like multiplicity.  You think multiplicity is a better movie than Dumb and Dumber?  I think Michael Keaton's really funny at it.  I think he's funny at it.  Multiplicity is better.  Just say multiplicity is better than Dumb and Dumber.  Makes me laugh more than Dumb and Dumber. 
[00:50:30]  Makes me laugh more than Dumb and Dumber.  No, fuck multiplicity.  Jack Frost.  You like when Michael Keaton goes, I like pizza, because he's the fifth copy, so he's  not as good?  No, but I do like when he goes, I like when he goes, when the doctor goes, what do you  do in your leash to relax?  And he goes, I like to golf, and I get to do that.  Let's see.  About never.  Gonna have to cut back on that.  It's funny, man.  Michael Keaton's funny.  Michael Keaton's funny.  He was always very good at Mr. Mom.  Mr. Mom was fucking funny, right? 
[00:51:00]  I love Mr. Mom.  Mr. Mom.  What are you gonna do in here?  220, 222, whatever it takes.  Yeah, whatever it takes.  You want a beer?  It's six in the morning.  Scotch?  Fucking great.  Fucking great.  No Michael Keaton movie is as good as Dumb and Dumber.  Shut your face.  Beetlejuice is better than Dumb and Dumber.  Oh, hey, huh.  All right, maybe Beetlejuice.  Beetlejuice destroys Dumb and Dumber.  Beyond Beetlejuice, no other Michael Keaton movie.  Fucking gung-ho.  You're laughing. 
[00:51:30]  It's funny.  Travis is watching multiple movies.  I like pizza.  I like pizza.  It's funny.  Yeah?  It's funny.  Eugene Levy's fucking hilarious in this movie.  Let's see what happens here.  Turn that up.  All right.  I like pizza.  You see, he's the fifth copy.  Yeah.  Get a cage.  He says, get a cage about a retard.  The copy of the copy of the copyrights.  It's fucking hilarious.  Much worse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's no Spaceballs.  No.  Spaceballs is better.  Spaceballs is so utterly bad. 
[00:52:00]  I'm kind of bummed that Jimmy never saw it, because I would love to watch him just say  how fucking horrible it is.  I probably wouldn't like it.  You wouldn't just not like it.  It's infuriatingly bad.  Is that Mel Brooks?  Yeah.  It's not infuriatingly bad.  It's infuriatingly bad, because everyone says it's good.  It's not good.  What stinks about it?  It's so bad.  The jokes are so bad, over-the-top delivery of them, like, all right, we don't need it  rubbed in our face.  Is that what the Schwartz be with you? 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  Who ever laughed at that line?  Apparently, a bunch of people think it's hilarious.  Let the Schwartz be with you.  And it was delivered by the character Yogurt.  See, his name was Yogurt instead of Yoda.  Look, that type of comedy was playing out at that time.  I'm not saying it's the man's strongest work, but I'm saying it's not as bad as you're  saying it is.  No, I'm saying I can't convey how bad it is through normal speech.  There are certain parts, like Yogurt and the Schwartz, that aren't funny, but overall, 
[00:53:00]  it's way funnier than not funny.  No!  You're a crazy person!  It's funny when he's talking about the doctor that's fucking his nurse.  When he's playing with his dolls.  And he goes, go back to the golf course and work on your putts.  That part's funny.  No.  Yes, it is!  You just laughed at it!  No, I was laughing at Travis fucking telling me the part where he's playing with his dolls  was funny.  Yes!  Not funny!  Can I make a suggestion?  I think we know what the next Secret Show movie show needs to be.  I think that's true. 
[00:53:30]  It needs to be Spaceballs.  The funniest moments of Spaceballs is a ten-minute clip.  And that's just, that's the maximum.  Yeah.  That they'll allow.  No, it's not.  Oh, the cross-eyed guy?  Yeah.  It's not funny.  You don't even think it's funny?  It is.  The asshole thing?  Jim, do you want to watch something?  No.  Oh, yeah.  What?  You went over my helmet?  Oh, God.  Well, not exactly over, sir.  Helmet jokes.  But more to the side.  I'll always call you first.  It'll never happen again.  Never, ever. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, shit.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Please, please, please.  No, no, no.  Put his finger in it.  No, not that.  Yes.  That.  Oh, he's shooting him in the penis.  He's shooting him in the dick with his little ring laser beam-y thing.  Look at that guy's face.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny how he's around by it.  Of course I do, sir.  Everybody knows that.  Of course we do, sir.  He's naughty. 
[00:54:30]  Beam him down.  Yes, sir.  Immediately, sir.  What are they doing?  What is this?  I've never seen this movie.  It's so bad.  Yes.  Here's the guy.  Close it backwards.  What's happened to his head?  It's on backwards.  This is terrible.  Do something.  Right about that.  I said it must have been a micro converter malfunction.  Why did somebody tell me my ass was so big? 
[00:55:00]  We'll beam you back, sir.  Forget it.  Forget it.  No more beaming.  This time I'm going to walk.  Oh, it's right, sir.  Why?  Why?  He was right next door.  Is that Jeffrey Timber?  No.  Sorry, sir.  I'm doing my best.  He's cross-eyed.  Who made that man a gunner?  I did, sir.  He's my cousin.  Who is he?  He's an asshole.  Stop laughing.  That's funny. 
[00:55:30]  That's a funny line.  He's an asshole.  It's funny.  Asshole.  Major asshole.  And his cousin?  He's an asshole, too, sir.  Gunners made first-class...  Philip asshole.  How many assholes we got on this ship, anyhow?  Yo!  That's funny, too.  That's all right.  Well, they got it.  I knew it.  I'm surrounded by assholes.  All right.  The reader, sir.  This part's funny when he breaks the thing.  Michael Winslow.  This is...  No.  Jammed.  It's funny when he breaks the thing.  Jammed.  And there's jam leaking out of it.  Yeah.  That's very, very...  Airplane-ish.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Raspberry.  Oof.  There's only one man who would dare give me the raspberry.  Lone Star.  They cut it off.  They didn't show it.  That's funny.  That's funny to me, too.  No.  Lone Star.  What?  Lone Star.  That was funny.  That's funny.  That was really funny.  Do I say they're getting hurt?  It's funny. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  This movie's hilarious.  That is fucking funny.  You guys are cracking up.  I can't believe this.  This ship flew away before he counted to three.  Yes.  We're going to have to go right to...  Ludicrous speed.  Ludicrous speed?  Sir, we've never gone that fast before.  I don't know if the ship can take us.  What's the matter, Colonel Sanders?  Look at what big his helmet is.  Chicken? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Colonel Sanders chicken.  I'm on a ship!  Stop this thing!  We can't stop.  It's too dangerous.  We've got to slow down fast.  This movie is great.  That's fucking funny the way he says it.  We can't stop.  It's too dangerous.  I want you to stop!  Oh, this is where he flies head first. 
[00:57:30]  Try here.  Stop.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  They're watching themselves on the monitor.  This is supposed to be that they watch the movie to see what happens next.  They acknowledge that they're in a movie so many times.  No, it's in the middle.  But they just acknowledge that they're in a movie.  It is blazing.  What happened then?  I laugh every time his helmet clanks.  That is funny.  When he puts his mask down and it clanks.  That's funny.  That's funny.  You're a dope. 
[00:58:00]  Just now.  When will then be now?  Soon.  How soon?  That is funny.  What?  We've identified their location.  Where?  It's the moon of Vega.  Good work.  Set a course and prepare for our arrival.  When?  1900 hours set.  By high noon tomorrow, they will be our prisoners.  Oh!  I don't see them, Sander.  Helmet's old, Sander.  It's not funny.  Yes, it is.  You're laughing.  You're so wrong.  I'm laughing at you guys laughing.  You're so wrong.  That's funny.  It's not funny. 
[00:58:30]  He's got like an adventurer helmet on it.  It's giant.  I haven't seen this movie in like 15 years.  I forgot how funny it was.  Oh, look again.  It's a movie.  We get it.  Spaceballs the coloring book.  It's Yogurt.  Look how funny.  His name's Yogurt.  Spaceballs the breakfast.  And he's an over-the-top Jew character.  Spaceballs the flamethrower.  The kids love this one.  Oh, God.  Last but not least, Spaceballs the doll.  Me.  May the Schwartz be with you. 
[00:59:00]  Adorable.  Oh, that's terrible.  He said adorable.  It's funny when he says adorable.  No.  He's not.  Sir?  What?  He's right there.  Why would he need the megaphone?  No, you fool.  We're following orders.  We were told to calm the desert.  Calm the desert.  Get it?  The megaphone.  But he prefaces it by saying, are we being too literal?  Nothing yet, sir.  Oh, stop.  They did it three times already before he said that.  How about you?  The megaphone thing is funny.  The calm thing is not.  Hold on.  This part's funny, though.  Oh, is it? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  What about you guys?  We ain't found shit.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Lord, help me.  What?  We need it on the bridge, sir.  Knock on my door.  Knock on my door.  You guys are fucking laughing like this.  It's hilarious.  He's playing with dolls.  I can't see you playing with your dolls.  Look how scared he gets.  Rewind that.  Look how scared he gets.  Because he gets caught playing with his dolls.  We ain't found shit.  This is a funny movie.  Lord, help me.  You need it on the bridge, sir.  You guys are just fucking around now. 
[01:00:00]  That's all.  Stuff is funny.  Oh, I think.  Did you see anything?  No, sir.  I didn't see you playing with your dolls again.  I'm not.  He's going to be a villain.  One, two, three, four, five.  The father.  That's the stupidest combination I ever heard in my life.  That's the kind of thing an idiot would have on his luggage.  It works, sir.  We have the combination.  Great.  Now we can take every last breath of fresh air from planet Druidia.  What's the combination?  One, two, three, four, five. 
[01:00:30]  One, two, three, four, five.  Yes.  That's amazing.  I've got the same combination on my luggage.  All right.  We got the job.  He's an idiot.  Prepare to baseball one for immediate departure.  Yes, sir.  And change the combination on my luggage.  All right.  The Darth Vader getting caught in something I enjoyed.  I can appreciate the slapstick Darth Vader character getting hit with things, but it  doesn't justify this movie. 
[01:01:00]  It's terrible.  This is not fucking good.  Who is playing that one stiff guy?  I don't know that guy's name.  He's really playing a lot of things.  I just think it's terrible.  Holy shit.  That John Kenny?  Yes.  Salute.  Hail, Scrooge.  Ship is too big.  If I walk, the movie will be over.  Sir.  Yes.  Never have that damn thing down in front of me. 
[01:01:30]  How do I know you're not making faces at me under that thing?  President Scrooge.  All right.  He's making faces.  Planet Druidia.  It's not funny.  What the hell are you doing?  Oh, he gave him the Vulcan.  The Vulcan neck pinch?  Oh, no, no, stupid.  You got it much too high.  It's down here where the shoulder meets the neck.  Like this?  Bill Pullman?  Yeah.  Yeah, Bill Pullman.  From fucking Independence Day.  Sanders, what's going on?  This is our Independence Day. 
[01:02:00]  That movie stinks.  Oh, terrible.  Let's nuke the bastards.  It's terrible.  What?  Get out on the horn.  Let everyone know how to take down these sons of bitches.  That part where Randy Quaid flies his plane into them.  When I saw that in the movies, the audience started applauding and I literally had deuce chills.  I was like, am I the only fucking person with a brain in this whole goddamn theater right now?  That's how I feel fucking watching Spaceballs.  You didn't like when he said, let's nuke, let's tell everyone how to take down these sons of bitches. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, it's so bad.  And then Judd Hirsch, Judd Hirsch basically doing the yogurt voice.  He's the yogurt character.  Ah, may the Schwartz be with you.  You're my son and you're brilliant, but you're an ass.  David, my son David.  Oh, my God.  They saved the wall, my son David.  Right.  I've never, I'll watch this though.  No, you won't.  The little, the little shrimpy Darth Vader with the big helmet does make me laugh. 
[01:03:00]  And like that, the fucking helmet clanking.  When he falls and his head goes into the fucking thing and the thing closes on his back.  That made me laugh.  Jim describing it is funny.  It's funnier than watching it.  Like Jim saying when the little Darth Vader guy bashes his head into something.  See, that's funny.  See, I like a certain slapstick like that with a clanging metal is funny.  It's funny, yeah.  I enjoy it.  It's like when a Stooges would smash each other with a wrench.  It would always make me laugh.  Oh, God.  And you're wrong.  The funniest Stooges thing.  I'm not wrong.  The funniest Stooges thing I ever saw, because it was so fucking, it was so fucking, should 
[01:03:30]  I not be talking over this?  No, it's not the same.  It was so morbidly fucking, like, sadistic.  Is Moe's on his hands and knees and Shemp, like Shemp's sitting at a desk and Moe's on  his hands and knees looking under the desk for something, and Shemp opens the drawer, and  Moe stands up and bangs his head on the drawer, and he goes, ah, you think that's funny?  And he takes Shemp's hand and he puts it in the drawer and just starts slamming the drawer  repeatedly. 
[01:04:00]  It's like, it's sadistic.  It's like so crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  You know how bad that would hurt?  I know.  It makes me laugh so fucking hard.  Shemp is my, I love Shemp more than Curly.  Me too.  I mean, Shemp, I prefer Shemp.  Me too.  He's such a dumpy man, and just to see a dumpy man, I forget what they were doing, but  they were doing, like, window washing, and it was like a broom or something, and Shemp's  on top of a ladder and Moe is blown, and he just takes the broom and he jams like the  big bristle end up into Shemp's face, and it just made me really, what a mean thing to 
[01:04:30]  do to a guy, jam a piece of wood into his face.  Did you ever see, did you ever see the one where the bathroom's flooded?  Shemp, classic Shemp, but the bathroom's flooded, he's got to get the water out of  the bathroom.  He takes out a drill, and he starts drilling holes in the floor to get the water out, and  he goes, now I'm using the old noggin.  Oh, God, stop.  You know what?  I want to, oh, did you take United Airlines? 
[01:05:00]  No, I took American.  Oh, okay.  I did have an issue, though.  Did you have an issue?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I definitely want to touch on, I guess we'll take a break, we've got our food here  and stuff.  I definitely want to talk about something that happened on a United flight, it was in  our little news story thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Again, though, they're just fucking...  They're terrible.  Terrible.  And Progressive Insurance has taken a fucking pounding.  Yeah, that's another one.  Yes.  Did you read the reply?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're terrible. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, we'll touch on all that shit.  They're terrible.  We'll take a break and eat.  I had a misunderstanding at United!  No, it wasn't you, was it?  I wasn't supposed to walk him.  Weren't you supposed to meet the little lad?  I got fired!  Oh.  Took him to take a nap in a room.  Poor boy.  Paul got fired.  Yeah.  They said you're supposed to take him to his connecting flight, not to a hotel.  I just said he was tired. 
[01:06:00]  Paul, terrible.  I will take a break.  Yeah.  We'll eat and we'll be right back.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On Sirius XM.

[01:08:00]  Thanks.  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony F you line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Son of a bitch.  Ah, nah.  You gotta keep us separated. 
[01:08:30]  Hi, Opie and Anthony program.  The lovely and talented Joseph DeRosa joining us today in Opie's stead.  We are sans Gregorio.  Sans Gregorio, who will be out also, I believe, tomorrow.  And Friday.  Friday.  Ah, jeez.  Where'd he go?  What is he doing?  He's having surgery done.  Oh, gee.  He had a problem with his scrotum.  And there was some type of a weird growth on the bottom of his scrotum. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, my goodness.  And it was about half the length of a finger.  Oh.  And they think it was his skin tag.  So he's having a giant skin tag removed from his scrotum.  Well, we wish him all the best.  Yes.  Good luck to him.  With that.  Yes.  A skin taggy bag.  Yeah.  So we're...  United.  Yes.  We were going to talk about United Airlines.  First, Joe DeRosa wants to just trash some dick bag that was fucking saying some shit.  Well, we were talking about The Matrix, Jim, before you got here. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  And we were saying how it's annoying that every time, you know, somebody brings it...  Like, all these nerds saw a Wachowski Brothers interview one time where they go, well, it's  based on these philosophies.  And then they all just went around acting like as if they knew those philosophies and  understood them.  And going, it's better than Star Wars because it's got this philosophy in it.  And it's just fucking annoying.  Shut the fuck up.  So, God Ali...  I don't know if this person is kidding or not, but they texted, they tweeted, Anthony  Cumia and Joe DeRosa-Comedy, this matrix, the matrix is an analogy of so, caps, dash, 
[01:10:00]  psi, dash, it, t, as if, get it, idiot.  It's a fucking, don't you get it?  It's a commentary on so, so...  We know it is.  We fucking said that when we were talking about it.  And our point was, we're already in the fucking matrix.  That was the point we were saying.  And if somebody told you you could take a pill to come out of this world you live in  right now and live in a goddamn rocky wasteland, you... 
[01:10:30]  Why would you do that?  Stay in the machine.  Even if you beat the machines, you still have to live in, like, what looks like Iran at  nighttime.  Who the fuck wants to live in that?  But by the way, I think what he was writing there, we've goofed on an episode of Quincy  where the gentleman said, so sigh, O.T.  Oh.  So he's probably...  He's joking.  Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.  That's just a show reference.  Maybe he's just a show reference guy.  Yeah, just somebody trying to chime in and have fun. 
[01:11:00]  Only a year longer.  I wish you would have told me that before when I said it at break.  They were just trying to be part of the team.  I wanted to yell at him.  Yeah.  They weren't looking at me humiliated.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  On your side, really.  I got the Blu-ray of Jaws.  I watched that last night, and the quality is so good that I believe, and I'm honestly,  I believe at one point when it's the beach scene where everybody's panicking, running  out of the water.  One of the lifeguards is standing on his lifeguard chair, and he's blowing his whistle, and Brody's 
[01:11:30]  like, no whistles, no whistles.  I believe during that scene, you could literally see up the guy's short leg and see his ball  bag.  The magic that is Blu-ray.  I really think I saw that.  Really?  Yeah.  It's rated X now.  That's too crisp.  Yeah.  Nail genitalia.  I don't like when it's that crisp.  It was pretty goddamn good.  Well, not as scrum, but the whole thing.  Is there a difference?  Yeah.  It looks really fucking good.  Because there's some movies that they'll re-release on Blu-ray, and they're just doing 
[01:12:00]  it to get another 20 bucks out of you.  Yeah.  It doesn't look any different.  That movie was made long enough ago where them putting it on Blu-ray and really redoing  the whole thing.  They restored.  It looks great.  It looks crispy and crystal clear.  Jimmy Norton, you just got back from California.  I did, yes.  And you flew the American Airlines.  I did.  And I read the same United story.  I had an issue with them, but nothing like United.  Oh, my God.  The United thing.  What happened?  What was your issue with American?  Leno always flies me.  They fly me first.  And I get to the airport. 
[01:12:30]  I'm in the lounge, relaxing in gentleman fashion.  And they say, well, James Norton, please come to the front.  I don't like that.  So I go up, and the woman says, listen, the seat that you're sitting in, we have to inform  you, it doesn't recline, the footrest doesn't work, and there's no tray.  First class.  Yeah.  What the fuck kind of ghetto plane are they putting you on?  So I was really annoyed.  I'm like, what?  It's unacceptable.  And she goes, well, there's a couple seats in business class.  But the business class seats, the leg rests aren't working in either one of them either. 
[01:13:00]  The two that are available.  What the fuck?  So I'm like, what's the matter with you people?  You're flying old planes.  But the woman was so nice.  The customer service was so nice.  She's like, we're going to get you a refund.  I'm like, I don't care about that.  I mean, that's NBC, but fine.  I'm like, I just want to get on the plane, miss.  I don't want all the overhead space taken.  So she gets me a seat where the actual leg rest works in business.  Whatever.  It's like, that's luxury problems. 
[01:13:30]  So I'm sitting in the chair and it's fine.  I'm like, I'm mildly annoyed on principle.  But I'm fine.  Right.  So I'm sitting there before the plane.  She walks onto the plane and gives me, tells me that the receipt has gone through and then  hands me a travel voucher for $1,000.  Whoa.  Jesus.  A $1,000 travel voucher because of the inconvenience of the downgrade.  And I was like, I want to write a letter because she was so nice.  Oh, that's very nice.  She was nice to me.  I wanted to be the angry customer so much. 
[01:14:00]  Of course you did.  But I wanted to say, why doesn't United, these shitheads who fight you at every turn, hire  someone like this, who I just, because now that the problem has been handled, I feel  like, okay, I'll fly America anytime.  There must be a policy in place at United where they just don't, they either don't hire nice  people or people are trained when they get a job there to just be fucking scumbags.  They're, they're horrible over at United.  That's how Delta is, too.  It's their, yeah, they're, they're, Delta's still an airline. 
[01:14:30]  They're, Christ.  All right, look, we all don't have radio and TV shows.  Somebody's got to fly Delta.  I was flying shit United.  But here's the thing with that, like that experience you had with a nice lady.  Nice lady was, uh.  Thank you, nice lady.  Nice ass.  Uh, I think, I really think that the, um, you, you find these like diamonds in the rough  in the airline industries, you know, because everybody's such a fucking cunt. 
[01:15:00]  And then you find somebody like that.  And then you also see these stories of these stewards freaking out and saying crazy shit  and running off the plane.  On the plane, right, yeah.  I really think, like, this industry is starting to implode.  It was getting so much pressure and flack from the outside for so long.  And now from the inside, they're starting to say, fuck you and fuck this.  And it's starting to crumble from the inside now.  I really think that's happening.  Maybe.  I mean, uh, because most of them are shitty and short-tempered and snotty. 
[01:15:30]  She was very nice, but the way she, she, there's no way she could have authorized that, that  type of travel voucher.  That was from the airline.  It was just, it was like these dummies that run companies.  If you handle a problem like that, people, I know there's problems.  It happens.  Yep.  The way you handle it is everything.  And now I have a good, I have a good feeling about the airline because they were nice  to me when they fucked up.  Good experience.  That's all.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not that irrational.  United, I had such an abominable experience with, and I finally got my money back. 
[01:16:00]  But, uh, just the way they fought me at every fucking turn.  Of course they do.  You can't get anybody on the phone.  Stand them.  And the story that you're talking about is unbelievable.  What happened to you?  No, it wasn't me.  Hey, this is, uh, this, well, I just fucking hate United.  They're pricks.  They, their planes are old.  They suck.  And they're grouchy people that work there.  Can't stand them.  Well, this is a story about a, a parent, a couple of parents put their 10 year old, uh, 
[01:16:30]  daughter on the plane.  And I guess United is, uh, supposed to, like any other airline, have some kind of a, a person.  There's, there's an actual thing with airlines where if you're flying some kid, uh, they're  supposed to have an adult that chaperones the child from the plane through the transfer  process and shit like that.  She had a connection from connecting flight.  Where was she going?  From where she was going?  To Traverse City, Michigan is where she was supposed to wind up.  And then she connected in Chicago.  Oh, she got to the United's hub. 
[01:17:00]  She was going through Chicago.  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  And there's supposed to be somebody there to meet, meet the kid right at the plane,  take the kid to the other flight and, uh, make sure everything's a hunky dory.  And, uh, the parents told the kid, don't go with anyone unless they have a United badge  and this person will meet you here and he has everything that's going to happen.  Well, there was no one there to meet the kid because they, because they sub out the work  for these chaperones.  They're not even United employees. 
[01:17:30]  They fucking get some scrubs.  I'm sure also if they took the time to do a background check on these people, they find  pedos all over the place.  That's not true.  Oh no, uncle Paul.  She was supposed to get on a flight from Michigan and I said, hello, Phoebe, Phoebe, you look  like you need a little nap.  A nap?  So we left the airport.  But the plane, it was a connecting flight.  The plane was leaving.  Nah, I told him she's going to be a little wild. 
[01:18:00]  She needs a bath and a nap.  She's tired.  You can't get to camp all cranky.  So we went to a motel and I was giving her a bed.  Yeah.  I was washing her.  That wouldn't work.  The child had to get to a connecting flight.  Yeah, I was washing her.  Good.  And the parents then had no idea.  Oh, those busybodies were very angry.  Not even a thank you, Paul.  She smells good. 
[01:18:30]  Thanks, Paul.  You wiped her tears right away.  No more tears shampoo, was it?  Oh boy.  Stop the shampoo making the tears.  For sure.  Yes, of course.  Thanks, Paul.  Look at the little united seat donut you gave her.  That's terrible.  I gave her a little donut to sit on so her bottom didn't get sore on the plane.  Little Phoebe. 
[01:19:00]  Little Phoebe.  Sure.  Yeah, the parents then had no idea where their kid was.  And called United for an answer was just put off, put off, put on hold.  Like your fucking kids.  Hi, my kid's missing.  They sent them.  First they send the call over to India to their call center in India.  Like it's lost luggage.  Or it's like, I want a fucking voucher because something happened.  No, it's a missing kid. 
[01:19:30]  And they send it to the call center in India.  There are, you know, people, these big dumb companies are not understanding how, what the beatings and how many people are finding out immediately on social networking.  They're not handling social networking well at all.  This is the beauty of social networking is the fact that now everyone is getting a voice.  It's not just, you know, the people that have radio shows and can say, hey, this company sucks and fuck me over.  Now, as long as it catches on and kind of people can rally around something, any old Joe can just get on there and tweet something that something happened and make a big deal of it. 
[01:20:00]  If it's a story that feels legit and not just some disgruntled idiot complaining, and this one felt legitimate, the progressive insurance one feels very legit.  The progressive one is, it's so infuriating.  Well, we'll wrap this one up with that.  They found their kid.  Oh, good. 
[01:20:30]  They finally, where was the kid?  Nah, she was no worse for wear.  Never mind you, where was she?  Never mind you, Joseph.  Like your goddamn business.  Well, because there was no person there to greet the kid, the kid missed the fucking flight.  Missed the connecting flight.  And the kid was asking, like, walked up to the counter and said, look, I have a connecting flight.  I'm supposed to meet.  And they were like, all right, just wait. 
[01:21:00]  Just wait.  And missed the connecting flight.  Because they're disinterested, shitty employees.  And the parents called the airport, and they finally got people on the phone.  And then one person goes, well, my shift is ending, so I have to go.  And they finally appealed to the person as a parent.  Like, this is our kid.  And then 15 minutes later, they talk.  But what fucking pigs?  That whole industry is just filled with disinterested, postal employee mentality shitheads.  Yes, it's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  And they got you by the balls. 
[01:21:30]  I remember, like, Air Canada can just fucking, they're the fucking worst cunts that ever walked on this earth.  And I remember one time, I was flying Air Canada, and it was the same old fucking horse shit with them.  Everything was late.  Nothing was working on time.  All this horse shit.  And I'm at the counter yelling at the guy, going, tell me why we are going to be late and why we're not boarding.  And he's going, sir, it's no interest of yours right now.  I'm just telling you.  And I go, I go, the fucking plane is out. 
[01:22:00]  I see the fucking plane at the gate.  Security, security.  Exactly.  We have a problem.  Security, security.  Exactly.  And he goes, if you keep it up, we're not going to let you on the plane.  And I was shown that night.  And it's like, you have to sit there.  They have you fucked.  Since 9-11, they've taken what is supposed to be security and your own safety and things like that  and perverted it into this ultimate power trip where a scumbag scrub employee now has the power to fuck your life over. 
[01:22:30]  If you, if you get them a little annoyed, they're fucking scumbags.  They should be ashamed of themselves what they did after 9-11.  They got free money.  They got fucking sympathy.  Oh, yeah.  They took it and they used it as a way to further hustle the public.  To further fuck everybody over.  They're fucking disgusting people.  They all have this attitude.  Every airline employee has the same attitude of like a fucking pothead sound man at a music club.  Like, hey, man. 
[01:23:00]  That's great.  No worries, man.  We'll get there when we get there.  And it's like, no, I got shit to do, you fucking cocksucker.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go.  That's why I'm flying and not taking a Conestoga wagon.  I'm in a hurry.  I hate it, dude.  I wish the whole industry would collapse.  I wouldn't give a fuck if I could never fly anywhere for the rest of my life.  Let it fucking collapse.  None of them.  The problem is like when this woman at American came on the plane and gave me that voucher, it was like she was just being nice.  The nice part of that was I fly so much.  I see so much shit behavior by these people. 
[01:23:30]  The fact that somebody went out of their way to acknowledge like, yeah, the airline screwed up and here's something nice.  It's like that.  That should be commonplace.  Right.  Yes.  The public is fucking unbearable, too, because I mean, the airline deals with the same shitheads that we deal with in audiences who were like, I was just laughing when they were talking.  So the airline has to deal with people trying to dope-fiend them for free shit, but they don't seem to know the difference between when they're legitimately at fault and when someone's being a cocksucker passenger. 
[01:24:00]  They've taken away every bit of comfort and just customer service.  Anything that is supposed to be there when you're taking people's money and supposed to give them a service is now just gone.  They're doing you a fucking favor now.  That's why I think that when somebody does a gesture like they did for you, $1,000 travel voucher, I really think that's somebody going, I'm going to fucking fuck this fucking airline, these cunts. 
[01:24:30]  Maybe, yeah.  And they do something and they go, what are you going to do?  And I had a guy once, I went to the wrong airport in the morning.  And you know that, like the worst feeling ever.  My stomach just sank.  Like, I was pulling up to the airport and I was like, I need to be in Newark and I'm at JFK.  I fucked up.  I just fucked up.  Yeah, you spaced out, right?  Yeah, it was the worst.  You know, and I'm like, I'm not going to make my gig.  I was freaking out.  Oof.  And I went into the guy and I just go, I go, please, dude. 
[01:25:00]  I just go, I'm begging you.  I need your sympathy.  And he started laughing.  He goes, dude, just pay me 50 bucks.  I'll get you on this plane.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, shit.  You gave him 50 bucks?  Yeah, I mean, like, it was a fee.  It wasn't like I slipped him.  I thought he was like, hey, dude, 50 bucks, I get you on a fucking plane.  No, but on the...  100 bucks, I'll take as much cocaine as you want me to.  Right.  Yeah, but like on the phone when I called, they were going, okay, it's going to be a $150 change fee.  You're going to have to pay the flight difference.  I'm like, this is going to cost you like $700. 
[01:25:30]  Are you joking right now?  Man.  Like, you have seats available.  And they go, just talk to the guy at the desk.  So when I got there, the guy at the desk goes, all you got to do is pay 50 bucks and we'll fix it.  That's pretty good.  I'm good.  You were fucked.  What airline was it?  I think that was Delta.  And I've been in screaming matches with Delta.  Screaming matches, trying to get out of flights because somebody died and they're going, we need to see a death certificate and all this shit.  I know, dude.  It's literally like fucking Rooney and Ferris Bueller.  Roll our old bones in here.  We'll change your flight. 
[01:26:00]  And just screaming at them.  And I was like, there's no...  And I went into it, like you said, ready to be angry, even though it was my fault.  Yeah.  And this fucking angel of a man was like, I'll help you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what you need once in a while.  Somebody just to be reasonable and nice with you.  And when they don't deal with you like people...  Yeah.  I'm telling you, that's why people snap so much.  Yes.  At work, at the post office, because you're a number.  You're not being treated like a person.  And it's like, and I'm not justifying these mentally ill fucking wastes. 
[01:26:30]  But you do understand how people at least throw punches at people, like...  Yep.  And fucking drill an airline employee in the fucking face.  Well, I do not like the idea that, in the airline industry, you can't voice a complaint there, at the airport, without coming off like you're a fucking terrorist.  You're a fucking...  They always pull that, hey, you want to fucking, you know, you want to get on this plane?  Hey, you want me to take you off this plane? 
[01:27:00]  You want me to...  It's like, really?  We've gotten down to where, if I have a problem, you're going to threaten the flight?  You're going to threaten my fucking transportation that I'm paying for?  They're scumbags.  Twitter's the best weapon.  It sounds like it's not, but they do notice that shit.  And when they see 70 or 100 or 200 bad, they will address you.  They will address you.  It's like, they can't not.  And they do.  So, I think that they don't know how to deal with this social networking. 
[01:27:30]  And it's like, it does help people not get fucked by companies.  Because airlines are just these...  They don't care.  I told this fucking scumbag from Hawaii.  He told me where he was from.  I'm like, because it was...  I went through the story already, but I'm like, you're going to lose me for good on United.  I told him, you're going to lose me as a customer over what I was saying was 400 bucks.  I'm like, you want me to eat that and not the airline?  Well, sir, we don't tell you what monies to spend. 
[01:28:00]  This scumbag...  He said monies.  He said monies.  This scumbag was going to just let me walk for 400 because he doesn't give a fuck.  But he attacked them on Twitter hard enough.  And then all of a sudden they see it and they do address you.  And they do address you.  Yeah.  United is bad.  In fact, I bought it when my mom got sick.  I had two tickets.  I had two gigs I had to cancel.  So, I had two tickets that were non-refundable.  And Delta, I believe, they were like, look, just, well, it's okay. 
[01:28:30]  Like, just take the money and, you know, you got a voucher.  Don't worry about it.  United, I sent them this long email saying I can provide medical records, whatever.  And they never even responded to me.  They just never responded.  That's terrible.  So, I just ate the ticket.  Customer care department.  The best way to do it is to write an email and CC the top officers because now that you don't – the first time I ever did this, I was writing letters.  And I was actually mailed out 15 letters that I demanded a receipt of signature for. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Cotton and I fucked me one time so bad.  You're hilarious.  I was so aggravated.  I did that.  I got to really change company policy.  Wow.  But you got to CC the top officers because then the other people below them see that these guys have been CC'd.  CC'd, and they might come and go, what's being done about this?  Because once in a while, you'll get, like, one of the top three or four or five people in the company.  If they see a complaint – they do care because they're not the scrubs.  They don't deal with – Jeff Smyzik at fucking United doesn't deal with these things. 
[01:29:30]  I love that you know his name.  His name I know.  Hell yeah.  He was the Continental CEO.  And he probably knows Jimmy's at this point.  By this time, yeah.  But that guy does not deal with the day-to-day bullshit.  So when something passes his eyes and he gets – and he looks at it, he may go, what is this?  Yeah.  So then they have to cut it.  Who are the assholes dealing with this fucking problem?  That happened a few weeks ago with Aetna.  Somebody tweeted the CEO of Aetna – well, he was just, you know, saying at Aetna – about how, you know, he's got cancer and he's got millions of dollars in bills and his health insurance isn't going to cover it up to a certain point. 
[01:30:00]  And the CEO read his tweets and he said, we're going to take care of you.  We're going to cover all of your expenses because the health insurance system is broken and this shouldn't be happening to you.  And we're going to help you out.  Wow.  So, yeah, you're right.  Like, you know, if the right person sees – the guy up top sees it, you know.  And if enough people – I mean, that's where we're lucky, where we have more followers and we're able to talk. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I read this progressive thing, Patton Oswalt, who's got like 700,000 followers Twittered it.  And I retweeted it because I follow Patton.  So I just – you know what I mean?  It's like when they see enough – man, when they see a thousand fucking response and progressive –  Yeah, what's the story because it's a horrific story.  I don't know it 100%.  Travis, can you look it up, the progressive?  Do you have it?  Yeah.  It's a very – it's an enraging story and their handling of it on social networking was abysmal. 
[01:31:00]  And they're getting a fucking beating.  It's got all the features, too.  Big corporation, like, just insensitivity.  And then the lawyer angle in this is fucking picture-perfect scumbag lawyers.  Scumbag.  And they actually changed their Twitter avatar.  Yeah.  Well, we'll go through it slowly.  But they're getting fucking murdered on Twitter.  Yeah, they changed their avatar.  They deleted all the robo-tweets.  Because they didn't want flow associated with – they didn't want their precious flow from progressive associated with this. 
[01:31:30]  But that's something that these companies still don't understand about, like, about Twitter.  And, like, when you fuck up and you do something like this, deleting it doesn't do anything because thousands of people have already retweeted it or screencapped it.  Like, it's there, you know?  So –  Yeah.  So –  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  And it's also the robotic response that they give us as individuals when we call.  When they do it publicly like that.  Yeah.  If they – they can't respond to every single person. 
[01:32:00]  Like, if they have a thousand fuck-you tweets, they can't just go, well, Joe, welcome from Minnesota.  You know?  But they should have – they should direct you to a written human response.  Which is what they're doing now.  They're trying to, yeah.  Now they deleted all their tweets and it just says our statement on the Fisher case and then there's a link to that.  All right.  So you want to go through where the case would happen?  Sure.  Because the guy's a comedian, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  His name is –  Matt something?  Matt Fisher.  So his sister was killed in a car crash. 
[01:32:30]  The man had – Nationwide?  Right.  She had Progressive.  Sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  In order for them to settle and get the money from Progressive, they would have had to sue him, the person who killed –  Apparently, he ran a red light and hit her, right?  She had the green, he ran the red.  Okay.  That was his fault.  His fault.  It was his fault, but in order for Progressive to pay out her settlement and cover all the medical bills, they would have to sue him to find him liable because – 
[01:33:00]  Right.  Because there wasn't anybody, you know, liable for the car accident.  So if he's found guilty –  If he's found guilty in a court of law –  Then they have a thing to go to Progressive and say, hey, he was found guilty.  He is the cause of this.  Progressive, I was insured with you.  You have to pay us now.  Yeah.  So instead of Progressive doing that, they actually paid – Progressive paid for lawyers for the other guy so he would win the case so Progressive wouldn't have to pay her for – 
[01:33:30]  He did the money out.  The money out.  Holy shit.  So they supplied the other guy with a lawyer just so they wouldn't have to pay.  Holy shit.  These fucking vultures.  These fucking –  Now, that's –  And they're denying that they said, no, he was defended by Nationwide, but then Matt, I think, went out.  And how did Matt –  I wish we could get him on the phone. 
[01:34:00]  I would love to ask him.  So apparently in Maryland you can't sue an insurance company when they refuse to fork over your policy.  Great.  Why?  That's just the way it is in Maryland, I guess.  How do you do it?  Well, that's what they did.  Instead, what you have to do is sue the person who killed the sister, establish his negligence in court,  and then use that as leverage to get, you know, the policy paid.  Can you then sue the insurance company if he's found negligent?  You can't sue the insurance company, but now you have enough proof to say, hey, he is found legally responsible for this accident. 
[01:34:30]  You have to pay us now.  By the way, how the fuck did anyone make that a law?  How is that in the public's best interest to not be able to sue the insurance company?  How the fuck did a politician pass a law that makes it illegal for you to sue?  Easily.  And it's representing the people?  Easily, though.  Fuck your mother.  Well, I mean, no, I mean, I'm not saying it's disgraceful. 
[01:35:00]  Those laws are the easiest ones to pass because those are the ones that never really see the light of day publicly.  That's stuff that shakes out through Congress or whatever.  Pork barrel, Joe.  Ear marks.  So it's a prime example of how, like, we talk about how you're represented by your congressman.  You're not.  That's a law that how the fuck did that get passed? 
[01:35:30]  When would you ever hear about it?  You know what I mean?  Like, when they're discussing the legislation for that, when would you ever hear about that?  Unless you went down to the hearings open for the public.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like when I worked in that shit in Texas at the Capitol, it was like, those things were empty.  And rightfully so, dude.  It's like sitting through a fucking skin graft.  It's the worst thing ever.  Like, they're so boring.  And nobody knows when that shit's going on.  Like sitting through space balls, right?  It's funnier. 
[01:36:00]  Now, what happened is that their initial, so people were killing them on Twitter.  Yeah.  And what was their initial response on Twitter?  Their initial response to everybody.  It was an automatic one that they had retweeted multiple times.  This is a tragic case, and our sympathies go out to Mr. Fisher and his family for the pain they've had to endure.  We fully investigated this claim and relevant background slash evidence, and this is where they're getting killed for right here, and feel we properly handled the claim within our contractual obligations.  Ah, yes, there you go.  Contractual obligations is what everybody's, you know. 
[01:36:30]  Again, this is a tragic situation.  We're sorry for everything Mr. Fisher and his family have gone through.  Isn't it?  That's their original tweet.  That's their original tweet.  And they kept retweeting it to everybody.  And that's where Gawker got them, too.  Or was it Huffington Post?  It looked terrible.  They were behaving like just fucking greedy fucking pigs.  How did they find out that the progressive had paid for the lawyers?  Well, he was in court.  What Matt Fisher said was when he was in court, he went to court.  He wrote a whole blog.  The guy who, I think nationwide, was settled immediately because they knew he was guilty. 
[01:37:00]  So when this guy had to sue to prove negligence to get progressive to pay, I think one of the lawyers identified themselves as representing progressive or something?  From what I read, Nationwide tried to settle a couple times, but it wasn't what they were looking for.  They needed more money because she had student loans.  She had a lot of – she died with a lot of debt.  And, you know, that's part of what you pay insurance for is to get the money if you die, you know. 
[01:37:30]  Wait, were they asking for an unreasonable amount?  No, they were asking for what – for seven – well, they eventually were awarded $760,000.  How much were they asking for?  I think they were asking –  That's it?  That's all they got?  They were asking for what the policy covered, what they were paying for.  $3,000 for a life.  But why didn't – what's that from?  Goodfellas.  Oh, now I've got to turn my back on you.  Why did fucking Nationwide – why did Nationwide offer to settle less? 
[01:38:00]  Why did Progressive accept that?  Why didn't Progressive demand more from Nationwide?  If you give me a minute, I can –  They probably just wanted the whole thing to end, you know, just end it.  They're hoping you go away.  Yeah.  They're just –  So now what is Progressive saying now?  Are they saying we're going to take care of it?  They're getting slaughtered.  I mean, no.  They changed their avatar so it's not that cunt flow.  That's hilarious.  Because all these horrible tweets with her dumb face next to them.  Yes.  And they wrote another one, another tweet. 
[01:38:30]  So then they wrote –  So now their official statement is,  To be very clear, Progressive did not serve as the attorney for the defendant in this case.  He was defended by his insurance company Nationwide.  There was a question as to who was at fault,  and the jury decided that the Fisher family –  and the jury decided in the Fisher family's favor just last week.  We respect the verdict and can now continue to work with the Fisher family to reach a resolution.  See, that even sounds phony.  And what Matt came out and said, he said he's furious.  Can you read his new – how he responded to that?  Yes.  He said, 
[01:39:00]  At the beginning of the trial on Monday, August 6th,  an attorney identified himself as Jeffrey Moffat  and stated that he worked for Progressive Advanced –  Moffat.  Moffat.  Hester Moffat.  The rest of me.  Your handicaps are showing, doctor.  Hester Moffat.  Jeffrey Moffat.  Moffat.  Terrible name.  He stated he worked for Progressive Advanced Auto Insurance Company.  He then sat next to the defendant.  During the trial, both in and out of the courtroom,  he conferred with the defendant.  He gave an opening statement to the jury in which he proposed the idea that the defendant 
[01:39:30]  should not be found negligent in the case.  He cross-examined all the plaintiff's witnesses.  And this is a Progressive –  Yes.  According to Matt, it is.  According to them, it's not.  On direct – I think what Progressive is doing, by the way,  is saying we didn't represent him.  We just sent a lawyer.  Right.  And that's their legalese of saying, like, yeah, they're not –  Because, I mean, this is the court system.  Like, if he's lying and Jeffrey Moffat wasn't there, like, you'd know immediately.  Oh, wait a minute.  So maybe this guy was not the lawyer of record for the guy. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, but maybe he was just a Progressive lawyer acting on their behalf.  Representing Progressive's best interest.  So technically what Progressive is saying is –  Is legally correct.  Is legally correct, yeah.  Oh, scumbag.  On direct examination, he questioned all the defense's witnesses.  He made objections on behalf of the defendant,  and he was a party to the argument of all the objections heard in the case.  And then Flo sucked everyone's dick on all the defendants.  After all the witnesses had been called, 
[01:40:30]  he stood before the jury and gave a closing argument  in which he argued that my sister was responsible for the accident that killed her  and the jury should not decide the defendant was negligent.  This is her own insurance company.  Yes.  Amazing, right?  Yes.  What a fucking –  Now, if that's accurate,  again, I would love to talk to this guy  because I don't want to say something that's right if it's not.  But if that's really the way it went down,  what –  They're going to lose millions of dollars,  these greedy cocksuckers,  because people –  First of all, people are going to cancel their policies  as a principal,  and people who would have gotten them 
[01:41:00]  will now go,  fuck them.  Why would I want them?  Why would I want them?  What was that last part about the sister being guilty of the –  say that again?  Please?  The jury should not decide.  Who said this, though?  The progressive lawyer.  Progressive –  the defense –  the progressive lawyer provided for the other guy.  He argued that my sister was responsible.  He was responsible.  He was responsible.  He was responsible.  He was responsible.  He was responsible.  He was responsible.  He was responsible.  Oh, okay.  And this guy.  Okay.  Now, okay, I was wrong.  Nationwide didn't offer to settle.  Progressive offered to settle,  but he claims never for more than a third of what they owed. 
[01:41:30]  Okay.  Jesus Christ almighty.  They just tried to fuck you –  What is this?  – out of your money.  Can we –  Just fucking sleepers?  Sleepers.  Did you ever see that movie?  Yes.  Where it's like they're going to –  we're going to hire the other –  the prosecutors.  Yeah.  So our friends get off on the murder case.  It's fucking ridiculous.  It really is.  Jesus Christ, man.  Gumbags.  They are –  they're fucking –  and this is like –  they're just terrible.  They're fucking terrible.  Soul is like – 
[01:42:00]  I mean, you know what the only answer is.  It's the only way to handle these people.  And we all know what the answer is.  It's like until people begin –  and this is not just progressively.  This is all insurance people or –  Yeah.  And bankers –  not bankers who are just doing their jobs.  People who are fucking you  and not caring that they're fucking you.  You've got to just drag them out of the office  and fucking drag them down the street.  And when a few people like that are beaten to death,  like, you know, whether it's investment bankers 
[01:42:30]  or like the people who are fucking –  when they start getting beaten to death in the street  for being such inhuman cocksuckers,  they'll stop doing it.  It'll stop.  Well, it's like that old Carlin bit about like  where he goes they want to enlist the death penalty  for drug dealers.  He's like, this is stupid.  He's like, drug dealers –  the death penalty only works if you use it on people  that are scared to die,  like the bankers that launder the drug market.  He's like, if you fucking execute a banker  once a week on TV,  you'll see that fucking drug traffic slow down  pretty goddamn quick.  Yeah, that's a good one, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  But, you know, I always talk about that too  with like when people talk about like –  you know, like when Occupy Wall Street  and all that was going on,  I was like, this isn't going to make a difference.  And people always go,  well, they made a difference years ago.  I go, you know when they made a difference?  When the Teamsters came around  and they were starting that up  and they fist fought the police.  That's when they made a fucking difference.  When Jimmy Hava and these fucking lunatics  were like, we will fight the goddamn cops  if we have to.  Like a baseball bat.  Like that's the only way to do it.  Like none of this other shit is effective  or whatever.  No. 
[01:43:30]  The phones are lit, by the way.  Are these –  anybody with knowledge of this case?  Oh my God, I wish.  I took a call earlier.  Ugh.  Guy wanted to discuss something  we were talking about yesterday  and didn't even like say what it was.  He just –  he just automatically started going into it.  What a fucking idiot.  Sam, what are they saying  that they want to talk about?  I wonder if anyone has more knowledge  on this Progressive case.  You want to go to Scott on Line 6?  What's he saying?  He might have some insight  on this insurance deal.  Scott?  Hello.  Good morning.  Hello. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, I was –  I worked for Progressive  for five years, actually.  They fucking suck.  And I used to write estimates for them  and they used to force me  to write huge used parts  and everything else aftermarket parts  that didn't even fit correctly,  five hundred inches  that didn't fit correctly.  That was a pretty ass.  But the negligence thing,  every state's got  different negligence laws.  I worked all 50 states.  Like Michigan,  and I think Maryland's one as well,  they have what's called a – 
[01:44:30]  I don't remember if they have  a 1% negligence,  where if you're even 1% negligent,  like say,  and I hope you have an accident,  if he's even 1% negligent,  then the other guy  doesn't know shit,  regardless.  Then you have other states  that are comparable negligence,  which if Opie's –  they figure out,  well, he was excessive speed  and he ran a light on a yellow 
[01:45:00]  and he hit Anthony,  well, we might find –  We've got to use our names for –  Well, let me ask you a question, sir.  That's annoying me with that.  Yeah, yeah, sir.  Hold on.  Let's say Jimmy is driving  at 50 miles an hour,  Joe DeRosa's hitchhiking  on the side of the road,  Bobby Kelly –  Opie –  Opie, picture Opie as Flo.  Opie, then comes a law,  but Sam is in the back seat.  Well, that's how they figured it out.  They figured it out.  Oh, shut it.  So basically the only way 
[01:45:30]  to get paid on 100% negligence  is if you're at a red light stopped  and somebody rear-ends you,  then it's 100% to zero.  But if both people are –  if both cars are moving,  there's a chance that in court  they can find something  that the driver in the right  might have been doing  less than 100% correct  to find that 1% negligence.  That's correct.  And that will normally be settled  by a –  rarely goes to 
[01:46:00]  a mediation or court.  Now, in a death situation,  obviously that's going to.  Now, the situation with Maryland,  if it was one of those policies  where there's a no-fault clause  or something,  then they would need  an umbrella to cover their ass  and they would have to be sued  outside of court.  And that thing about  the attorney with Progressive,  guess what?  It's fucking House Counsel.  It's what?  It's House Counsel.  House Counsel.  Yeah.  They have their own fucking attorneys.  Let's say, for instance, 
[01:46:30]  let's say Rich Voss  was House Counsel.  And let's say  Bonnie McFarlane  was driving the vehicle,  but Opie was on the side  of the road  fixing one of the light posts.  And that –  Oh.  You don't like this guy's name?  I hate the way he uses –  The names.  You're an absolutely asterisk driver.  Oh, right.  That's so funny.  Listen,  we did not represent  United to the best of our knowledge, 
[01:47:00]  okay?  Exactly.  They would fire Voss  when he just tried to say  Progressive in open court.  Yes.  Progressive.  Progressive.  Thank you, sir.  That's interesting.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  I didn't hear any of it.  I got two side-trained  and he yelled at him.  I know.  I lost.  I just say thank you.  I lost the whole thing.  That was good, though.  Yeah, he did explain  like the percentage of whatever. 
[01:47:30]  They're terrible.  It's ridiculous.  But, you know,  it's a sad thing  when you hear a case like this  because it's, you know,  like when that Chick-fil-A stuff came out  and everybody was like,  I'm not going to support Chick-fil-A anymore  because they did it.  I'm like,  every commercial thing we support  is somehow tied into something filthy like this.  You literally would have to live on a farm  and grow your own vegetables  and have a water well  and that's it.  Like, that's the only way  to not in some way  put your money 
[01:48:00]  towards some disgusting,  corrupt,  something you don't like.  I wouldn't put money  into Chick-fil-A, though,  but not because the guy  gave his opinion  because whatever his opinion it is,  it is,  but because then I find out  that he's like,  he doesn't like gay marriage,  but then they're giving  all this money  to causes that fight  like these fucking family places.  so fuck that cocksucker.  I wouldn't give knowingly  to a company that feels that way  and financially supports people  that are fucking,  that's why I would never buy it.  That's what made me tap out  when I found out 
[01:48:30]  where the money was going.  When I learned that,  I was like,  I can't,  I just can't do it.  I can't do it in my right mind.  But what I'm saying is  I will,  I will cognitive,  I will actively,  cognitively.  Yeah,  I don't fucking know,  sorry.  It was great just to watch Joe  immediately dumb that down  to actively.  I just really fucking  porky-pigged it.  Porky-pigged it.  I would,  I will not actively support that now,  but I know at the same time  any other fucking place  I'm going into,  the money is somehow 
[01:49:00]  getting to some,  I mean,  you hear it about,  you hear it about  goddamn charities,  like non-profits and stuff.  They do disgusting shit  with taking the money,  it doesn't,  the kids don't fucking see it.  You know,  everybody knows that.  That old story,  but you know,  it's just gross, man.  Yeah.  Are we having any luck  with this guy?  No.  His phone just keeps ringing,  ringing, ringing.  Oh, they're trying to,  okay.  Yeah, I'm sure it does.  He's probably pretty popular.  No, no,  but where's he from?  He lives in New York.  He's a New York comic?  Yeah.  He's a real man.  He looks familiar. 
[01:49:30]  Can somebody,  why don't you text his number?  Okay.  If you've got the number,  text him and say  who we're calling from.  His Twitter says,  yeah,  he lives right here in Brooklyn,  so.  Why,  are we in Brooklyn?  So right here in Brooklyn.  Why didn't he say he's a New York comedian?  Let's start checking.  He's probably in bed.  Let's start checking  we were in the heart of the apple here.  Yeah, right?  If he's in fucking bed,  if he's a New York comic,  it's 8-11,  I'm acting like,  why isn't he awake?  Because he's a New York comic idiot.  He's sleeping.  Yeah, true.  Jim, do you want his number?  No, you guys do,  which I don't know  if that's actually him. 
[01:50:00]  Really?  Well, yeah,  who knows  until it's actually him.  Oh, okay.  And by the way,  you could search  court cases  on Maryland's website  and that guy,  Mr. Moffett,  was definitely there  and definitely identified himself  Mr. Moffett  as a progressive.  So why would progressive  come out and say,  why would they come out  with that fucking  legalese horse shit,  which is basically  lying by telling the truth?  Yeah, I mean,  that's what they did.  That literally is like  your girlfriend  wants to know  if you fucked her friend 
[01:50:30]  and she said,  did you fuck my friend?  And you did.  Yeah.  So you go,  oh, yeah,  I fucked your friend.  Sure I did.  You're lying  by telling,  then she goes,  oh, I'm sorry,  why would I think that?  You've just told her  the truth  and lied  through your inflection  and everybody knows  what you did,  but in paper  it looks good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Robbie told the truth.  Sure,  I stuck it in her ass.  Remember you were  in the hospital  having a breast removed?  I fucked her  in the mouth. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  It is,  it's disgusting, man.  It's fucking disgusting.  Jesus Christ.  I am shocked  the older I get  at,  I mean,  I can't wrap my head  around it.  You hear shit like this  and you're like,  but you'd have to be  this evil  to do something like that.  And it's one thing,  like,  you know,  it's one thing  if you're a goddamn  serial killer,  maniac freak,  and you go,  well,  at least that fucking guy  wears it on his sleeve  and I know  he's a lunatic.  Yeah, yeah.  But I mean,  to put a face on like this  and fuck people like this 
[01:51:30]  and still,  like,  go to sleep at night with it  and go to work every day  and act like somehow  you're not a demon,  like,  that's crazy to me.  And there's no accountability  to it because,  again,  like we've dealt with here,  they'll just point upstairs  and be like,  well,  it's just policy.  Like,  but who made the policy?  Who's the one that said,  let's send a lawyer down there?  Like,  but no one,  there's no one  that ever does these things.  It's a conglomerate.  It's a bunch of people.  But you know what?  I won't even let them  off the hook by saying  that they're just as part  of this evil thing. 
[01:52:00]  Because Jeffrey Moffat,  or whatever his name is,  has a fucking house.  Right.  And he gets fucking  anal fissures  or whatever it is he gets.  He gets a cough.  His fucking kid's  fucking up at school  or his wife didn't make,  or whatever it is  that normal people have.  He's not some,  and again,  I don't know this guy at all,  but he's not some  corporate machine  who has been  plugged into the board.  He's a regular fucking guy.  He's one of us.  And the people  that fuck each other  are people just like us. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  It's like,  we like to put them,  that's why I don't buy  a lot of this Illuminati shit,  because these people  that are part of the board  are just regular fucking,  they're a reflection of us.  It's like,  we're all like,  how could they be so terrible  and such monsters?  They're made up  of fucking us.  They don't ship  these people in with that  from fucking another country.  Well, yeah,  again,  to reference Carlin again,  it's the thing about  how he doesn't vote,  where he talks about  there's no,  people always say,  we're the stand-up leaders  and politicians.  He goes,  we don't have people 
[01:53:00]  like that in this country.  You get what the system produces,  garbage in,  garbage out.  Like,  this is the best,  these people come from  American homes  and American families.  They don't come from  another dimension.  You know what I mean?  But it's...  They're not fucking,  they're not space people.  Yeah.  So we act so shocked  that they could be like that,  but that's every fucking person  in a comedy club that talks,  that's every person  that doesn't fucking yield  when you're merging,  when it's fucking,  you know,  when there's a one-one,  one-one,  they go,  two,  my turn,  my turn!  That's every fucking, 
[01:53:30]  we all deal with them  every day,  and then we act shocked  when someone acts  like a cunt like this.  Did you ever see the,  did you ever see  the Twilight Zone,  the monsters are coming  to Mayberry Street?  Yes, that's hilarious.  So you have one of the classic,  it's probably the classic  Twilight Zone episode.  They discuss it in like  literature classes  and shit like that  or philosophy classes,  whatever.  But the whole thing is about,  Sure, Mike,  why is your house  the lights coming up?  Yeah.  the power goes out  on this block  in the suburb  where everything's  beautiful and nice,  whatever,  and the power goes out  and then they realize  it's not just the power,  it's all, 
[01:54:00]  anything electric  doesn't work.  The car's nothing.  And they just start  to fucking turn  on each other  and they start accusing  each other of being  like up to some plot.  Like the second the lights  come on on one house,  like they came on  in one house  and they're like,  Hey, why are your lights on?  What do you know?  What did you,  yeah, yeah.  They're a bunch  of fucking assholes.  Yeah, and they're all  ready to kill each other  and the big twist  at the end is these aliens  are like,  this is how we'll  conquer this planet.  We'll just take away  their power  and they'll just turn  on each other  because they don't know  how to coexist  in a crisis situation. 
[01:54:30]  And it's like,  you know,  to put it in the  terms of this,  this is the way  people justify it.  They go,  their crisis situation  is my family  or my car payment  or my job security  or my whatever  the fuck it is  and they just keep  justifying it  till you get  to a fucking point  where you're sitting  there going,  well, if I want to  buy this suit  for myself,  I've got to go  to work every day  and do this evil shit.  I mean,  you break it down  to that small level  and then they just  think that it's okay. 
[01:55:00]  And they don't think  it's evil.  They don't think,  they don't look  at it like that.  They go,  it's my job.  Hey, you know what?  Got to do my job.  Like, there's no  right or wrong.  It's just my job.  There's none of them  will say,  this is wrong.  I'm being a scumbag  by doing this.  And they do that,  they do that,  they do that police  interrogation mentality  thing of like,  well, hey,  they do it to me  so I might as well  do it to them first.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's really 
[01:55:30]  fucking gross, man.  But once you're  down that road,  you're fucked.  It's like going down  any other dark road.  Once you start  creeping down it,  you'll justify anything.  Well, we've kind of  made that ourselves  because the law  is set up to,  you know,  all right,  guilty people go to jail  and some people don't.  But there's like  such a cut and dry  and I guess you have to  to have this many people  protected by the same laws.  But there are so many times  where we know  what the right thing is  but because it doesn't go  by the letter of the law 
[01:56:00]  and when we allow  the fucking letter of the law  to override  what we know is right,  that's where we get  into fucking trouble.  And it happens a lot  and it's hard.  I don't know how to fix that.  But how do you,  how do you mean?  Because I'm not,  I don't know if I'm following you.  Okay, perfect example.  It was in death penalty cases.  Okay.  Or in other cases.  If evidence comes in late  or beyond a certain period of time  or let's say in a rape case  a prosecutor  because the rape happened in 1985  there's a little bit of blood  left on a sock or whatever 
[01:56:30]  the convict goes  I didn't do this  I want DNA testing.  The prosecution  so he doesn't lose that conviction  will fight  the convict getting that DNA testing  even though it will prove  much more conclusively  than anything else  whether or not that's his blood or not.  And then the flip side is  well prisoners sue for everything  so you can't just let them continue  to do what they want  because they're all going to  waste your time.  But in that case  where a guy is saying  can you test this DNA  why does it take three years?  Like why doesn't the state 
[01:57:00]  why are we giving money  to fucking Egypt  to try to fund their fucking  child television shows  which are friendlier to the west  instead of putting all of our money  into DNA testing  a guy who goes  look that's not my cum on the sock  I didn't rape this chick.  How the fuck is that?  Not just done for free.  Right, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like that's where it's fucking  and they don't get caught that much  that scumbag Nifong  whatever his name was  in the Duke case  Yeah.  The Nifong  who was the  prosecutorial misconduct 
[01:57:30]  and he was eventually disbarred  I think  because those three guys  he knew those guys  didn't do it  or he knew the evidence  showed that it didn't look  like they did it  and he kept going anyway.  Well and that's very interesting too  because that speaks to  the like  somebody doing that  like a prosecutor going  I know this  these guys aren't guilty  but I'm going to keep doing  that's the same thing  we're talking about  with like the evil deeds  of any corporate guy  that's that guy going  I got to do my job  and my job is to win the case  and my job is to keep my record up  and then my family gets to eat  and we have shelter 
[01:58:00]  and whatever  it's fucking nuts man  There's no humanity to it  None, none  this fear of survival  is fucking crazy  it's crazy  90% of us  and I don't think  I'm using that figure loosely  90% of us  have friends  have family  or have both  where if the bottom  completely fell out  of the fucking boat  we'd have somewhere to go  we'd have some couch  to sleep on  we wouldn't end up  in the goddamn street  there are a lot of homeless 
[01:58:30]  people in this country  it's a fucking shame  it's a problem  I hope it gets fixed  but when you think about it  percentage of homeless  to percentage of non-homeless  is so fucking small  it is such a goddamn gap  between those two percentages  and people freak the fuck out  oh my god  and like people in our shoes  know  nothing's gonna happen  every guy in this room  took a goddamn gamble  with our lives  we went out and did comedy  we did radio  you didn't even graduate  high school ant 
[01:59:00]  you know what I mean  you're bigger than I Joe  you didn't  no  I didn't know that  I didn't know that  but you're better than us Joe  yeah what are you all  all of a sudden  Mr. Harvard  are you a fucking  Sumner Redstone  everything's fucking  peach fuzz  the fuck are you  Bishop Sheen  but you know  that's my point  is like  everybody in this room  took their chances  in their own way  and said look  I'm gonna do what I feel  is right for me to do  right now  and whether it was  positive negative  mistake or whatever  you're still alive 
[01:59:30]  I don't know anybody  literally  and I know  drug addicts  and hopeless alcoholics  and fucking douchebags  I don't know anybody  that's about to become homeless  I really fucking don't  I don't know anybody  so destitute  that you're not gonna survive  in this world  if it's not by your own doing  or some unforeseen circumstance  like cancer  or something like that  so this fucking sickness  of this capitalistic sickness  of like  we have to do  what we have to do  or we're not gonna live 
[02:00:00]  and it's fucking insane  it is the downside  of capital  and I'm sure all human beings  have that  but it's one of the  uglier parts  I got a text  from a friend of mine  she writes  my washing machine hose  broke and flooded my house  while I was at work  for nine hours  all states adjuster  offered me a check  for three dollars  and sixty five cents  for the hose  because  his rationale  and she wrote  a rationale was  the hose  was the only thing  that broke  and I should be responsible 
[02:00:30]  for the floors  all of my appliances  wall insulation  they sent a cleaning crew  to my house  they accidentally  tore the wires  to my water pump  out  when pulling out  insulation  it cost thirty five hundred  to fix  all states had  to call  serve pro  to fix it  and then drop  my policy  ah  those motherfuckers  they're fucking  they're just  horrible  scumbag  insurance people  and I know  they have to deal  with a lot of  scumbags  they have to be  on guard 
[02:01:00]  because people  lie to them  all the time  and try to get  free money  they have to  investigate claims  because then you  see a guy  who claimed  his leg  got bitten  off by a shark  fucking doing  the Watusi  in his yard  and you're like  how is this guy  doing the Watusi  with two healthy legs  right  that's a good  example actually  but this is  a classic  classic symptom  of an overpopulated  society  and we live  in one  ah the commercial  sorry Joe  yeah yeah  progressives  they're really  going crazy  with their commercials  I can't see what  she's saying  but I think  she's saying  if your sister 
[02:01:30]  dies  we'll fuck her  too  yeah we'll fuck  her over  yeah  look at this box  yeah we won't  run her over  but we'll sure  make it sadder  that she got  run over  terrible flow  close a cunt  I hope something  bad happens to  flow  got another one  on the bottom  they just are  pounding commercials  yeah yeah  well you know  flow must be like  doesn't this just  seem fucking  embarrassing  it's embarrassing  it's disgusting  yeah with that  story  they're getting  murdered 
[02:02:00]  yeah  and they should  and this is where  twitter  like people who  hate twitter  I get it  but this is where  it actually pays off  where people can  fucking really  a legit  scumbag company  move  yeah  it's so hard  to put that  human element  that you were  talking about though  in these businesses  it's not  you know  it's not  18 fucking  60  where you got  the mercantile  and you go down  there and  you know  you open up  your account  and it's a  one on one  basis  now it's just 
[02:02:30]  you were talking  about how  people are just  like us  but there's this  collective that  goes on with  these companies  where you can't  deal with  somebody's  individual  common sense  there is this  you know  there might be  evil people  in the company  but there's also  cool people  in that  but as a  collective  they're just  under the  umbrella  of the  corporation  and I  think that  that's more  evil than  the sum  of its parts  right  you know  it's  because there's  zero accountability 
[02:03:00]  it might be  the individuals  that are bad  but they never  have to be  accountable  to anything  because you  could just  pawn it off  on the  progressive  logo  hey who  did it  they did  see that  big blue  thing that  says progressive  that's the  evil thing  I just work  there  it's a product  of an over  populated society  because things  are so jammed  up and there  is so much  to attend to  that they have  to start to  make these  general practices  and broad 
[02:03:30]  rule  it's the same  reason why  every single  person in an  airport has to  go through this  goddamn fucking  rigmarole  because one  asshole tried  to bring too  much Gatorade  strapped to his  nuts through  and they were  like oh it's a  fucking bomb or  whatever  or an entire  group of people  under the heading  of the same  religion  have been  consistently caught  plotting to  bring down  planes  it could be  one of those  things too  it could be  because we  fucking  we had a  couple of  planes fly  into buildings  and then  fucking  Richard Reed  tried to 
[02:04:00]  fucking  blow his  toes off  I know  that  tootsie  bomb  I know  that  but my  point is  is that  when you  go  security  it's a  little  ridiculous  we know  it works  every time  they catch  somebody  they up  it even  more  they make  it even  tighter  and you're  sitting there  going  it doesn't  have to be  this bad  for everybody  this is  ridiculous  but they  have to  do it  like that  and then  it's the  same thing  with these  companies  with the  bureaucratic 
[02:04:30]  practices  where they  go  everybody tries  to steal  from us  therefore  we cannot  entertain  it's the  same  mentality  at the  airport  everybody's  a terrorist  and we  just have  to treat  it like  that  everybody's  trying to  fuck the  company  we just  have to  treat it  like that  and it  sucks  and it's  bullshit  but it's  because we're  too goddamn  overpopulated  part of the  difference is  and I do  know your  point  is that  when you're  getting onto  a plane  like when  they're  searching  you  they are  literally  trying to  stop somebody  from blowing  up the  aircraft  it's not  and I know  that there's 
[02:05:00]  money going  around  and TSA  employees  but it's  not based  on fucking  the individual  passengers  out of money  without conscience  like it's  it may just  be a blanket  thing where  we all got to  pay for the  the piggish  behavior of  some  but it's  not based  on being  a scumbag  and fucking  you out of  money  but it is  based on  efficiency  to the  harm of  you  the individual  maybe not  financially 
[02:05:30]  there is  definite  definite  physical harm  at stake  there  people just  walking through  that big  machine  like  and they  never tell  you  if you  don't want  to go  through this  radiation  device  right now  you have  to  and Burr  told me  he goes  dude  if you  just say  you don't  want to  do it  they have  to pat  you down  so I  do that  Jesus  Christ  I don't  want to  cook me  before I  get on  the flight  they don't  cook you  and I  love the fact  that people  are so afraid  of the  machines  and then  they spend  eight hours  with a 
[02:06:00]  tape to  their  face  that's  just  silly  that's  a valid  that's  a valid  point  that's  a very  valid  point  but my  whole thing  is that  I never  use this  without a  fucking  wired  headset  I won't  even use  a bluetooth  but here's  my point  is that  that's  one of  those  things  where they  go  we need  to be  efficient  we need  to get  these  fucking  animals  through  the gate  right now  we're  herding  the sheep  and we  don't  have time  we're not  going to  fucking  tell them  that this  could be  detrimental  to you  and that's  why if  you ask 
[02:06:30]  we can't  say no  to your  body frisk  request  but we're  also not  going to  tell you  that that's  an option  because it's  going to  slow  everything  down  but do  they look  at it  like that  or is  it actually  a more  efficient  way of  screening  people  because  I trust  an x-ray  like that  a lot  more  than some  dopey  TSA  employee  or disinterested  TSA  I trust  the x-ray  a lot  more  and believe  me  you could  put something  on your  taint  and they're  really  I mean  they do  check  pretty close 
[02:07:00]  when they  do that  but it's  not going  to be  as thorough  as a  fucking  amazing  science fiction  device  that looks  through clothes  but yeah  look  I'm not  saying it's  not cool  oh yeah  cool as shit  but my point  is  is it  worth the  trade off  it's this  it's this  again  everybody's a  terrorist  we have to  put them  through this  device  that could  give you  fucking  cancer  or god  knows  what else  you're  right  it's not  worth it  like I said  it's very  I mean  from what  they say  I mean  they're not  going to tell  you if it's  bad  right 
[02:07:30]  but the TSA  people  don't you think  the TSA  people would  object  they're standing  there all day  yeah but I don't  think they're in it  no but they're  standing  fucking a foot  in front of it  do you think  people working  airport security  have a  a high enough  IQ or b  enough job  options to go  I'm not going to  stand next to this  machine all day  stupid fucks  aren't they  when is the  the last time  an American  plane got  taken down  and even then  the security  didn't fail  it was just  what their  procedures were  in place  if the pilots 
[02:08:00]  didn't come out  but it works  it sounds crazy  but it's  mildly annoying  and you can get  a pre-screen now  for the TSA  where you walk  right through  with your fucking  shoes on  oh you can  I want to do that  but it works  and then people  say well  how could they  search all  and then they  find a cell  here where  they're fucking  plotting something  or they do  find these  liquids  and it's like  what's the  answer  how do we  expect them  to stop  people from  doing this  I'm not  willing to  sacrifice my  civil liberties  but I don't  mind going  through airport  security  as long as 
[02:08:30]  it's handled  with politely  and like  you know  having a flight  when they do  that and I  just walk  through without  an issue  and occasionally  get the bag  searched  it's not  that big a  deal  I don't  I don't  I don't  I don't  deal with it  all the time  yeah and I  don't disagree  I do not  disagree with  anything you're  saying but  but my  point is that  it's a product  of overpopulation  if we lived  in a reasonably  populated society  there would be  time to do  an efficient  security check 
[02:09:00]  just as efficient  and thorough  without bringing  radiation into  the fucking  picture  there just  would be  like there  would be a  way to do  this properly  but like that  kind of thing  that happens  with every  single public  service system  any sort  of customer  service related  thing  they can't  deal with  the situations  properly  they can't  deal with  it case  by case  there's too  many fucking  people  I mean it's  at a point  now  I mean people  were complaining  about automated  systems when you  call places  10 years ago  it's at a place  now where like  they literally  companies literally 
[02:09:30]  do things now  where they go  if you want to  talk to a person  you have to pay  five dollars a  minute or whatever  it is  it's so fucking  crazy  part of it is  but part of it  is also the  like think of it  where you're saying  if it was a  smaller population  let's just say  america was half  the population  right  which is what  150 160  million people  so that  then everyone  is going to be  hand frisked  going through  like people  are screaming  about TSA  hand searches  they're screaming  about it  by civil liberty  so then  they put in  the machines 
[02:10:00]  and people  yell about that  that is radiation  it's true  yeah  there's never  a point  where the public  says  hey  I get it  and yet  when something  happens  the public  never says  you know what  I didn't want  security  and this is the  price I pay  for not having  security  is I am now  plunging  there's never  that balance  because people  always say  like  well you know  well fuck it  you can't just  randomly frisk  people  well then how  do you get  certain things  done 
[02:10:30]  good police  work  okay let's  infiltrate a mosque  you can't infiltrate  a mosque  but that's good  police work  no it's not  you're stereotyping  okay so I can't  stereotype  so what is good  police work  it's not using  your cop intuition  people talk  in fucking circles  because they want  to look at the  system like it's  somehow coming  down on them  and then when you  break it down  example by example  there's never  a balance  it's never where  they go okay  that's a good  point  like okay 
[02:11:00]  that makes sense  that type of  an intrusion  or that type  of an inconvenience  makes sense  because the  payoff is  look we have  been  they are dying  to take down  another fucking  plane  oh they'd love  it  and it has  not happened  they have not  been able to  do it  despite the fact  that a lot  of these guys  are willing to  commit suicide  to do it  it has not  been pulled off  no one's even  been able to  get on to  hijack a plane  just the old  school like  hey take me  to Cuba  no one's even  been able to  do that  security's a  deterrent 
[02:11:30]  even if it  doesn't stop  every single  thing  terrorists all  see it  happening  it's a fucking  deterrent  and every time  they find  somebody doing  something new  like Richard  Reed getting  his fucking  shoes put out  showed them  oh that's what  they're gonna  do  so then they  know  okay the  system is  now on to  this  we have to  find a new  way  there's all  this liquid  shit  alright we  have to do  this  maybe it's  effective  maybe it's  not  but it does  but you know  what I mean  it's like  where's the  balance  I don't want  them frisking  me when I'm  walking down  the street  either  no I don't  want them  frisking me  when I'm  walking down  the street  but I do 
[02:12:00]  think it's  fucked up  that they  don't inform  the public  hey you  have the  right to  not go  through this  machine and  get hand  frisked if  you want  and that  they don't  say it  because in  their head  it's like  just move  these fucking  idiots through  here right  now  but is it  dangerous  I know  what you're  saying  but is it  dangerous  because I've  also said  they said  it's less  it's much  less than  this  the radiation  you go  through it  a lot  though  it's a  cumulative  thing  for as much  as we fly  I mean you  fly more  than I do  but I still  fly a lot  where I'm  like I'm  not doing  that every  other fucking 
[02:12:30]  two weeks  or whatever  it is  you know  it's just  too much  and that's  what's crazy  to me  is I go  alright  well obviously  if it's not  dangerous at all  you wouldn't  even allow  the hand frisking  anymore  they have  the authority  to do that  they have  the authority  to go  shut your  fucking mouth  you will  do whatever  we say  before  yeah  they have  the authority  to do that  and they  don't  so something  something's  fucking fishy  about that  to me  that when  you ask  them  and they  go  oh okay  step over  here  and we'll  fucking  grab your  balls  instead 
[02:13:00]  you know  which I  don't mind  yeah  I usually  get it in  the restroom  though  and I love  the fact  that the  media gets  so crazy  every time  a child  is searched  meanwhile  if they  didn't  have the  deterrent  we will  search  kids  then the  next time  somebody wanted  to fucking  pack c4  onto a plane  they'd put it  in a kid  bomb  it's like  it makes  me nuts  when people  just feel  victimized  by every  ounce of  security 
[02:13:30]  we have  to go  I don't  feel  when I  I check  it's almost  weird  like you  don't even  have to walk  up to a  fucking agent  anymore  you can literally  just print your  boarding pass  at home  and the first  person you  talk to  is at the  security line  whereas years  ago it was  the three  dumb  questions  long before  9-11  it was  did you pack  your bag  they were  asking those  annoying  questions  here's the  thing  I don't  get  I need  to be  careful  when I  say this  because I'm  not being  insensitive  to what  happened  racist  no no no  no  I'm very  I mean  I was talking  to myself  the shooting 
[02:14:00]  the Batman  shooting that  happened  I mean  it's horrible  absolutely  horrible  tragic thing  like and  I'm very  very  empathetic  and sympathetic  toward it  but that's  what shocks  me and  this is why  I don't get  all bent out  of shape  about the  idea of a  terrorist  plot or  anything like  that  this whole  thing is so  fragile to  begin with  I am  shocked  that  that  that sort  of thing  happens as  infrequently  as it does  and it's  horrible  but you  when that  happened  I was  I was 
[02:14:30]  watching the  news clips  in a  diner  with a  friend of  mine  and I  go  I go  do you  realize  like how  fragile  this whole  thing is  that can  happen  literally  at any  second  anywhere  right  anywhere  and the  fact that  terrorists  aren't doing  that sort  of thing  in this  country  makes me  think  the terrorist  threat  isn't quite  as great  as we  think it  is  that does  seem like  something that  would just  happen every  day  that's what I'm  saying  like I feel  like it's a little  and I'm not saying  the terrorists are not there  but I'm saying  I think it's a little 
[02:15:00]  more in control  than we like to think  that it is at times  I think you're right  you know  I think you're right  okay  but we don't want  that's a good point  but you don't want to  let the guard down  because then it won't be  I'm not saying  let the guard down  but I'm just saying  like  there's something  to be said  there's something  you know  this is my  hat trick  for Carlin  references  sorry  but he did that  thing  and he did it  before 9-11  happened  about the airlines  where he goes  where he talks about  like the airlines  fucking with you  security wise  he goes 
[02:15:30]  they got you  by the balls  they make you  do whatever  they want  that's their  way of reminding  they can fuck  with you  whenever they want  and he goes  because people  will always trade  a little bit  of freedom  for the illusion  of security  the illusion  yeah  he's like  they'll always  trade it off  and that's  that's the thing  I think  I'm not saying  let the guard down  but I also think  that we take  this fear  and we  or we  meaning them  or whoever it is  and they use it  as a way  to go  we can do  whatever the fuck  we want  and sometimes 
[02:16:00]  it's good  sometimes it's like  Jimmy saying  with like security  at the airport  and we get through  and it's you know  and nobody dies  on the plane  or whatever  but a lot of the times  it's like  you know  what we were talking  about earlier  with these insurance companies  and these bureaucratic  corporate practices  where they're just saying  to you  we have you  fucking afraid  we'll take your  we will take  your fucking policy away  yeah that should  never be an option  to use that kind  of fear  to fuck you  I had situations 
[02:16:30]  with movers  when I had to move  home with my mom  I had situations  with these movers  where these guys  fucked me  they charged me  $400 more  than they said  they were going to  I paid it  I didn't argue  movers are the worst  yeah I got to the place  where they put  the storage unit  where they put everything  everything was all fucked up  I had to move it out  reload it  I called them  I go  you guys have to give me  a discount  you have to give me  some money back  I had to reload it myself  the reason I hired you  was so I wouldn't  have to do that  and I had to do it  right  they argued with me  we screened each other 
[02:17:00]  for 20 minutes  a guy got on the phone  and goes  Mr. DeRosa  you do not understand  what you are talking about  you are out of line  if you call us again  we will send you a bill  for additional charges  and he hung up on me  that's great  that's good  and I called my lawyer  yeah I called my lawyer  and my accountant  I go  do they have the right  to do that  and he goes  yeah they can do  anything they want  and he goes  no you can fight it  and he goes  do you feel like  going to court  for three months  to get $200  and I was like  no  and he's like 
[02:17:30]  then leave it alone  but that's  it's such a small scale  example of how  this all fucking works  they scare you  to a point  where you go  I'm not going to  fucking push back  I can't  I work for Moish  Mayflower  yeah  I fucking pop wheelies  I do wheelies  in the truck  move everything  when in reality  I had a little situation  up there in Middletown  in Middletown  I don't want to talk about it  I have problems  with my fucking boss  yeah  this guy doesn't want  to buy the car  I push his face  right in the fucking hood 
[02:18:00]  you buy this fucking car  I'll break your fucking head  I'll break your fucking head  yeah my glasses fell off  I'm like  what happened to him  I stepped on those  motherfuckers  Chip fucking  listened to those  tapes  we made them  they stole that stuff  from me and my friends  you probably didn't  you probably didn't  the chippy boys  I don't believe you  Chip  but they  there's no recourse  they can fuck you  like that  and it's amazing  and it's  unbelievably frustrating  they can fuck you  like that  and to get back 
[02:18:30]  to the fear thing  how  will they fuck you  like that  that's the thing  they get this fear  thing in our heads  where we go  well they might  so I better not  you know what I mean  it's like that thing  it's the fear of being  crushed by something  so much bigger  and with so much money  to spend  yeah absolutely  it's like when a guy  mouths off to you  in a bar  and you go  what the fuck  and you want to say  something back  and then you hear  your mom's voice going  he could have a gun  you know what I mean  he could have a knife  you better not 
[02:19:00]  and then you just go  I'm just gonna let this guy  call me a fucking  cocksucker  I'm just gonna walk  out of here  I'm gonna be the  bigger man  or whatever  yeah and you're like  yeah you know  it's stupid man  but you know  an example we've talked  about on the show too  is there really is  a weird checksum  Nixon was brought down  by guys with flashlights  like somebody  like that brought down  the presidency  like there is a really  weird level of  accountability  like when you look  at it like that  like if he wasn't  protected  once things get pushed 
[02:19:30]  to a certain point  publicly  like progressively  being pushed publicly  now  and we didn't have  Twitter years ago  but like they have  to do something  once everybody knows  it it's harder  for them to fuck you  when it gets over  that fucking  that initial hump  of the roller coaster  it's just gonna go  you know  then they all run  for cover  and they'll just  help you to make  then they want it  to go away  because the fucking  the crushing  is coming from  everybody  it's like we're  afraid of being  crushed by them  they're afraid  of being crushed  by all of us 
[02:20:00]  collectively  I also get pissed  though when they  acknowledge that  something's fucked up  and they fix it  because it just shows  how fucking phony  they are  of course  it's like oh  because you got  caught now  now you're gonna  be like  we always want  a good customer  and they have  that line of shit  they take care  of the problem  and then meanwhile  thousands of other  people just get  fucked without  you know any  voice or anything  it's like when  you're a kid  and your mom  makes you go over  to the fat kid's house  and go now apologize 
[02:20:30]  and you gotta  stand there  in his living room  sorry  I'll play with  wrestling toys  like fan fiction  yeah  you're right  it's like who  gives a fuck  at that point  because I caught  you now you're  sorry  go fuck yourself  you know it's like  my like you know  I say regular guy  Joe Baggett  Donuts  when Joe Baggett  Donuts  let's just say  I'm driving  Joe DeRosa  I'm in the car  right  Jimmy Norton's  at a light  that's right  and you see  and you see  a very tall  young lady  in the seat  next to me 
[02:21:00]  Jimmy pretends  not to notice you  as he speeds  through the red light  humiliated  yeah we'll take  a break  make love  make some love  do some reads  right  don't we have any  do we have any  just one  just one  woo we're loaded  nice  we shall return  ooh that's like  a famous saying  we shall return  alright take a break  this is the

[02:23:30]  on your  after show  Sam  the other day  and  well Sal  remember when Sal  made  it was a little  thing for Roland  who we call the  angry panda  because like  he's a big  lovable  kind of guy  he looks harmless  and hey  he got a little  giggle and  everything  but then when  he gets pissed  he's the most  notorious  horrific guy  to get in an  argument with  yeah he's vicious  vicious  vicious  so you know  it was kind of  like I would call  him the angry  panda  it's kind of 
[02:24:00]  a good  it's an  affectionate term  a term of  affection  endearment  guy who over  explains  a term of  friendship  and then  Sal  thought  he was  going to  propel  himself  into the  world of  genius  and production  and show  his talents  off  by making  a quick  sounder  for the  show  whenever  we  whenever  Roland  gets mad  with this  angry panda  thing  and it  it literally 
[02:24:30]  killed  using angry  panda  if you remember  he ran in  like middle  of the segment  oh yes  guess what  I've got the  spice this  segment needs  it's the  cherry on  top  Sal  is going  to be a  legend  after this  yeah he  thought he  was fucking  in  and it  stinks  it wound  up killing  that we  don't even  call him  angry panda  anymore  because it  just it  was so  bad  listen to  this  it sounds  let me  just tell  you what  the voicing 
[02:25:00]  is terrible  the sound  itself is  horrible  and it  sounds very  amateurish  fuck him  it does  fuck him  it does  it is what  it is  what am I  supposed to  fake it  let's listen  don't get  the panda  angry  and a lion  that's the  whole thing  that's it  yeah and we're  supposed to play 
[02:25:30]  that whenever  whenever  rolling gets  mad and we  would be like  that's fucking  brilliant  I wish  the fucking  lion in  that bit  would have  eaten him  halfway through  recording that  so I never  had to hear it  it's so bad  it looks like  Jim liked it  that's fucking  terrible  isn't it  horrible  because that  lion's first  of all that's  the lion roar  from exorcist  3  whenever the  fucking demon  would roar  and would trail  off into a  lion roar  can you hear  that again  yeah listen  in the voice  too  it doesn't 
[02:26:00]  it doesn't  have a powerful  thing  it's cheesy  effects are put  on it  whose voice is  that  I think it's  Sal's  oh Sal  had to do it  himself  it's Sal's voice  and it's layered  right  yeah  Sal it's terrible  yeah it stinks  Sal are you humiliated  by that piece  it was the biggest  regret I've had  since I've come  he's so humiliated  by it he's never  even tried again  and he won't  he will never again  try to do a piece  of production  let's hear the  funny Roland thing  if Roland gets upset  let's see what  happens  we play this  Roland's getting mad 
[02:26:30]  oh shit  don't get the panda  angry  and it's so long  you would have to  sit there  you would have to  sit through that  30 seconds  or whatever it is  you guys talk  the panda is still  is still talking  what's the explosion  well that's the  explosion that  turns a panda  into a lion  it's a panda lion  bomb  panda lion  it's a gene pool  explosion  that's terrible  that's  yeah  it's yelling 
[02:27:00]  the sound of  DNA splicing  it's not a powerful  yell  it's sort of  no it sounds like  the fucking  boy king from  fucking  Game of Thrones  shouting  don't get the  panda angry  oh god  he's  Sal  sucked  I know  it's terrible  I apologize  I hate the slow  purposeful diction  one more time  he didn't think  it was terrible  when he  before you said  it was terrible  he didn't think  it was terrible  oh he thought  it was great  don't get  the panda  angry  picture him 
[02:27:30]  by the way  when we listen  to it here  again  picture him  in the studio  in front of the  mic  yelling this  because I would  have loved to  have seen a video  and I'll bet you  he held his  headphones  when he  fucking yelled  and he probably  had his hands  on his stupid  headphones  to get the  full sound  of his own  teenage girl  voice  yeah you don't  have a powerful  voice  that's right  terrible  let's hear  don't  get  the  panda  angry 
[02:28:00]  oh  sorry  oh  god  what a douche  oh man  you suck  that is  fucking  terrible  it's so  douchey  is that hideous  I hate it  and I just  don't get  like a drop  should be like  two seconds  like  Roland starts  getting angry  then you hit a  button that goes  angry panda  or something  like that  yeah whatever  you know  why don't you  make another  one sound  jesus christ 
[02:28:30]  the beethoven  of sound drops  in there  this is my  finest work  it has seven  movements  fucking live  live leonard  skinnered version  how about this  the panda's so mad  it should be in  mad magazine  or something  something like  that  and you play  a bunch of  panda sounds  of a fight  or something  good one  believe me  I would like  that more  than I liked  you hated  sounds thing  it's so  it gives me  that ugh  like I'm  watching space  balls  oh wow 
[02:29:00]  you hated  space balls  oh I hated  it  it is a  terrible drop  it's horrible  no it's really  bad  really bad  yeah  what's the worst  part  is it among  the worst  that you've  ever heard  yeah even  like not  including radio  it's like  it's one of  the worst  things I've  ever encountered  it's horrible  you know what  recording is  better than  that  we will rock  you  and we will  roll you  going down  down  down  feel

[02:31:00]  obviously  but if you  at any point  if they were talking to you  and you started telling a story that went on for too long  because you were too high  they would drop that in  over the speaker  they would go  feel  feel  feel  feel  my heat  feel  feel  and it was just like  yeah it was their way of saying you're bombing stupid  keep  keep fucking moving  Dr. Steve  is on the phone  oh  Dr. Steve  yeah you know what  excuse me Dr. Steve

[02:48:30]  she looks like a deep sea fish  that you bring up  too fast to the boat  she looks like a fish  that you've been  I can't count all the ways  how  she does look like  a progeria kid  what's a progeria kid  it's that kid with those  kids with the disease  that makes them  look older  dice what's a progeria kid  it's just fucking  disasters  what are they  oh  I can't wait to hear  someone say 
[02:49:00]  don't care if it's  brain dead  don't care if it's  limbless  if it has a penis  pregnant women  are smug  oh  everyone knows it  nobody says it  because they're pregnant  it's a world  you're enjoying  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel  feel my heat  I'm not feeling  they're really  sweet girls  they look very sweet  and nice  they're lovely  they're both a couple  of toilet mouths  using dirty language 
[02:49:30]  that girls shouldn't use  I'm just not feeling  the comedy part of it  I don't really care  it's not my  yeah  Jim's got a good point  that there's a very  specific audience  it's not my cup of  anything funny  well it's a less  cynical like  I'm not a good judge  of that stuff  because it's not my  sensibility but  it doesn't stink  it's just not my  sensibility  I bet they're nice  are they nice people  Joe  they're really sweet  I never met them  and I probably  they're supposed to do  bash them  they're really fucking sweet 
[02:50:00]  I mean they're  you know  kind of impish looking  it's the blonde  what are you gonna do  they use dirty language  Sam  well  I heard it  I don't like that talk  that they do  you see  Joseph  that's so gross  how can he make  a poke  with a finger  so fucking bad  it's the  it's the lightness  of it  it's that it barely  touches your skin  which makes it gross  Joseph  it's fucking nauseating 
[02:50:30]  Joseph  Joseph  um  yeah that's fucking  terrible  I mean you know  but I'm not a big  I mean it's not  I'm not saying it's terrible  it's just not for me  but I'm not a big  musical comedy  Flight of the Conchords  was the only  musical comedy act  I am  that really  like those guys  blew me away  because they took  such like this  weird  approach to it  like where I was  like  it was just  they were just  amazing to me  like the way they  would do these songs 
[02:51:00]  where they were like  telling these fucking  stories  like it was so  odd  and it wasn't just  like hey this is a  funny song  it was like  we're gonna do  these songs  as these characters  and like go back  and forth between  each other  these two characters  and it's gonna play out  and it's the plot  of the song  will keep twisting  like they kind of  took like the  kids in the hall  approach to sketch  writing and did it  as musical comedy  and it was so funny  to me  and like Tenacious D  I liked for a little  while but it got  it just got too 
[02:51:30]  repetitive  I can't take that  shit  that fucking  oh Jack Black  oh enough  with Tenacious D  fuck  I would rather  watch Spaceball  alright Anthony  we get it  I hate it  yeah  yeah I'm really  I think it wasn't  Jack Black nice  when he was on the show  he was nice then  it was when I did  Leno with him  that he wasn't  he just ignored me  he was a dick  to you on Leno  yeah he just wouldn't  like I said  oh fuck him  Jesus  stop already 
[02:52:00]  it's  there's nothing  by the way  it's like  Jack  like old Jack Black  it's like  here's what would have  happened if Belushi  lived  you know what I mean  it's funny when you're  fat in your 20s  and you're like a stoner  then you become like  the 40 year old  I used to be the stoner guy  but now I have kids  and I've slowed it down  so now I'm gonna  make a few kid friendly movies  and then also try to revisit my route  and it's like you can't  you can't  like that  you did this thing  it was like when Tom 
[02:52:30]  when Cheech and Chong broke up  and Tommy Chong  wouldn't let it go  yeah yeah  the old stoner thing  yeah and Cheech is like  I'm just gonna go play cops  in TV shows  play cops  I fucking  do a lot of movies  not even acknowledging  the stoner guy character  yeah  and Tommy Chong  just was going around  going  why is he playing cops man  yeah yeah yeah  fucking sell out man  you're like  Tommy you're 60  let's get the act  back together man  no  sorry  doing movies now  don't even do the 
[02:53:00]  Mexican accent  in a lot of the movies  by the way  by the way  can we talk about  lost you fuck  let's just talk  let's just  let's just get it out there  please  when it comes to  overrated comedy  ugh  Cheech and Chong  stunk  no they were funny  I just threw it  Tommy Chong  I thought was funny  Cheech was literally  one of those guys  where he was like  I can kinda do  an English accent  so that means  I can do a punk character  and it would just be  Cheech  looking like a Mexican guy  going  ah good day  mates  or whatever 
[02:53:30]  and you'd be like  this is the worst  English accent I've ever had  why is he wearing  a blonde wig  this is not fucking funny  you didn't like  Cheech and Chong's  next movie  there was some  funny stuff  oh my god  Up and Smoke's kinda funny  Up and Smoke was funny  and they were classic  because they were doing  pot jokes  and a lot of people  weren't doing that type of  movies or whatever  but I thought  that movie was hilarious  I'm not on the page  today with everybody  I liked  Up and Smoke  with um  Stacey Keech  was in that one  was he? 
[02:54:00]  yeah it's funny  when he goes  you mean with smoke  and cat shit man  or whatever  or dog shit  that part's funny  their stage shows  were terrible  their albums  were not funny  days not year man  that was okay  yeah that was funny  yeah  um  let me  let me rephrase  I'm not saying  they're void of humor  but I'm saying like  as far as like  when people go  classic  I'm like  come on man  it's not  yeah  when people say  Freddie Prinze  was like  ugh  funniest guy ever  he's okay  like you know  it's not classic  we get that  Mexican Chicano humor 
[02:54:30]  it's hilarious  I'm a Mexican  American  I know  Mexican American  I enjoyed that  yeah  take Spanish  and get a B  you hear the dumb song  he sang  this is what he would say  looking good  that was his catchphrase  he got a fucking catchphrase  Freddie Prinze  Freddie Prinze  had a catchphrase  it was looking good  but don't forget  he died when he was like 25  yeah that's his problem  he probably would have  shot himself  he probably would have  lead poisoning  ah get it  he probably would have  developed into a better comic  yeah 
[02:55:00]  yeah he's young  yeah he probably would have  Chico and the Man  yeah  he's in that one  yeah  you know  who else from that era  is just fucking overrated  like  as far as  like comedy goes  yeah  there's a lot from that era  man  dude I think  fucking Belushi stinks  John Belushi  or Jim  well Jim definitely  you think John Belushi stinks  I think John said  I think  this is what I think  I think John Belushi broke  a certain ground 
[02:55:30]  comedically  I think there's certain things  he did where it was like  okay this is the first guy  to do it  it's very funny  whatever  but I think  it does not hold up  for the most part  and I think a lot of it was  everybody's coked out  and it's really funny  to watch this guy  who's clearly doing things  that are fueled by cocaine  and that was a big chunk  of the humor to me  I think  don't forget  certain things that have been  copied  don't hold up as well  sure  Pryor doesn't hold up as well  because there's so much  second and third generation 
[02:56:00]  manufactured black comic rage  that when you hear  the organic article  it just sounds like  what you've heard already  like you know what I'm saying  and I think Belushi  there's been so many guys  that have done that  type of thing since him  I think he was really  like the Blues Brothers  he was fucking hilarious  he's very funny  I see Joe  dot dot dot  shut the fuck up  yeah he was really  wow  who's that from Jim Belushi  I think John Belushi 
[02:56:30]  was really funny man  I think Candy was funnier  John Candy was a funnier  fat man  Candy was way funnier man  but Belushi was a funny dude  yeah yeah  Candy was way funnier  look I'm not  again  not saying he was void of humor  devoid  am I saying the wrong thing  oh boy  oh boy  Jesus Christ  I'm really off the  Joe Rosa  don't conquer  invite here  I'm not saying 
[02:57:00]  yeah I'm not saying  he was humorless  but I think it's  I think it's super  I think the early  death thing  causes it to be  way way way  more glorified  than what it actually was  like I mean  did you ever watch  aside from  take Blues Brothers  out of the equation  can you think of a lot  of John  I mean  yeah  Belushi  can you think of a lot  of a John Belushi  stuff  like I can still watch  Pryor live in concert  I will double over laughing  double over 
[02:57:30]  like you gotta see this  you gotta see this  if somebody doesn't see it  can you think of a lot  of Belushi shit  where you would say that  well because  only because Pryor  was a stand up  but no  no  but I can't think of  like if you said to me  name Chevy Chase  sketches from back then  I can name the Pryor  nigger one  but I couldn't name  a lot of them  I completely agree  with you about that  Chevy Chase is the same  exact boat  like Chevy Chase  was very funny  playing the dumb  aloof guy  but like other than  that like you know  I couldn't name any  of them  like Aykroyd and  Steve Martin  I know that the  brothers that they did  was an amazing bit 
[02:58:00]  but I can't name a lot  Landshark I think  I can't name a lot  of characters from back  then from any of those  guys so I just don't  remember them  you know what  yeah  Saturday Live  stunk  you're right  that whole fucking  thing  stunk  I'm not saying that  I'm saying I just  personally can't remember  like I  because I can't do it  with Belushi  isn't a reflection on me  not thinking he was  really funny  SNL used to be  they used to push  the boundaries hard  man  when they did that  bit with Chevy Chase  and the fucking 
[02:58:30]  line was nigger  and he said  dead honky  that was fucking  they would  they would challenge  what society thought  like they were  really doing funny  shit back then  now it just seems  like it's  it's not quite  you know why  they don't do it  now  fucking  it's the overpopulation  you know what  and they don't want  a big  a big lay  in their progress  yeah I mean  a big lay  god damn it  god damn me 
[02:59:00]  Steve Martin  as a host  I fucking  stink  I know I stink  thank you Steve  I'm sorry  I apologize  to the listeners  I stink today  SNL I thought  was a great show  but here's what's  funny  is the Eddie  Murphy cast  the Eddie  Murphy cast  and I didn't know  this until recently  was crucified  in the meet  like that  Piscopo Murphy  cast was the  cast that took  over for the  Chevy Chase cast  and they were  crucified  they were like  this crap  stinks  whatever 
[02:59:30]  there are so  many more  sketches from  that cast  that I'm like  classic  hilarious  dude when  Piscopo does  did you ever see  the Sinatra thing  where he talks  about buying  American cars  when he did  Sinatra it was  fucking great  people loved it  the fucking guy  is talking about  the dangers  of like a  foreign car  and he's  Sinatra and  he's going  this is  Jap labor  this is  Jap labor  we're talking  about  don't buy  Jap  dude it's  one of the  funny singing  fucking songs  about how 
[03:00:00]  you gotta buy  American cars  find that  find that  Travis  that is so much  fucking funnier  than literally  99% of anything  I saw  any of the  original cast  do  I don't know  I can't name a lot  of the  it's all from  where your  childhood was  yeah the  original cast  they did like  weird like  really quirky  shit  and it was so  new that  anything flew  you know  it was like  the bass  was it  Bass-O-Matic  yeah that was  funny  where he just  put a fish  in a fucking  blender  the plastic bag 
[03:00:30]  thing was funny  too  yeah  bag of nails  and what was  that thing  that male  prostitute  yeah that was  funny  yeah yeah  yeah that was  kind of funny  Fred Garvin  were they the  cast though  wait a minute  because Dick  Ebersole  was there  when Murphy  was there  not Lauren  Michaels  yeah  wasn't there  a cast  right after  Belushi and  them or was  it Murphy's  I don't think  it was Murphy  I could be wrong  I've been watching  it on Netflix  yeah  it's  Chevy Chase 
[03:01:00]  came back  and hosted  or Bill Murray  came back  and hosted  and the whole  opening sketch  is the cast  being like  Bill we can't  we can't shake  this with you guys  man like  like you know  the joke was like  we're getting  trashed in the  press  because you guys  were in the  shadow of you guys  and then Bill Murray  was like you guys  are great  you're black  that's funny  you know like  oh the original  cast did  Roseanne  Rosanna  Dana  oh Gilda  Radner  Jesus  I forgot  that  fuck it  yeah  that you  miss Emily  Littella  yes 
[03:01:30]  yes  and then there  was when she  was with  oh god  Bill Murray  doing Todd  and then the  girl there  but here's my  point  Mr. Robinson's  Neighborhood  is funnier  than  Cheeseburger  Cheeseburger  Cheeseburger  it's funnier  than Samurai  it's funnier  than Coneheads  it's funnier  than the  the bees  like those  are all the  ones with  classic  fucking sketches  find a Belushi  sketch  because I  don't remember  a lot of them  I just didn't  you know  Coneheads 
[03:02:00]  didn't like  the Coneheads  oh the Coneheads  stunk  you want  Samurai Delicatessen  Samurai Deli  that's one  and you're right  they were just  conceptually odd  a lot of these  yeah  yeah and it was  that's kind of  what they were  supposed to be  you know  just weird  because everybody  was high  yes  very high  you're fucking  coked out  on a Saturday  night  it's funny  to watch a guy  with a samurai  sword for no  reason in a deli  yeah  you know what I  mean  it's just like  a weird thing  yeah you would  be so stoned  that you would  just laugh at 
[03:02:30]  everything  I found the  Chevy Chase  prior thing  I mean it's  classic  oh yes  well  this is  now this is  the commercial  this is a  samurai delicatessen  samurai delicatessen  can you get  Netflix on here  with Buck Henry  by the way  Buck Henry  he was big  back then  I'm already  remembering  yeah  it's blue  she's smashing 
[03:03:00]  eggs with his  bare hand  yeah because  he's at a deli  but he's a  samurai  it's crazy  because that's  how samurais  would  they smash  everything  apparently  yes  he's running  the deli  like he  like he  would  but he's  he's got a  samurai sword  he's calling  off the numbers  people love it  I'd like to 
[03:03:30]  I'd like to have  a combination  cold cut sandwich  very lean  on the corned beef  and a cream soda  he's cutting down  little pieces of meat  from the  you're not  that's the first time  I realized  Jesus Christ  it's a real fucking sword  it really is a real sword  he's using  he's cutting up  the salami  dangerous  he's gonna cut himself 
[03:04:00]  how many times  did he cut himself  I wonder  he just head butted  the bread  and it  it opened  you're not feeling this  are you  no it's not funny  but it's also  pause this for a second  though  certain things  like if  not funny  not funny  watching this  in the 70s  like watching this  when it was on  you gotta put it  in the context  like very few things  carry over  as like the  honeymooners  which I still think 
[03:04:30]  is amazing  a lot of people  younger generations  don't think is  really  yeah  so I mean  they might recognize  it as funny  yeah that's true  but uh  no I don't think  this bit's hilarious  but I don't think  it stinks either  but I think it's  like any other  any other era  like there are some  there are some bits  from the 70s  that are way funnier  than this  sure  you know  and they hold up  that's what I'm saying  that's what I'm saying  I think a lot of Belushi  is nostalgia  and the tragedy  of the whole story  and I think a lot of it  is  is  is that people 
[03:05:00]  were so fucking  whacked out  and that shit  was funny  when you were whacked out  it's like dude  I'm trying to think  of like a good example  of like  what's like a good example  of like modern day  drug humor  like pot  probably when I say  something like  I was smoking  wacky tabacky  and I got  sued it  oh god  well  I'll tell you this  they're like  we're talking about  Jack Black earlier  the day will come  when those fans  like look back  on that and go  this isn't funny  because I'm not  high anymore  yeah yeah  you know what I mean  like that  that'll probably happen 
[03:05:30]  can you pull up  Netflix  and I'll  I'll log in  and I'll show you  that Sinatra sketch  like I think  I think Irvin Mainway  holds up  and it's hysterical  yeah  and you know  I kind of agree  with Joe  Dan Aykroyd's  one of those guys  like he's way  fucking funnier  than people think  he's just like  not the best  he's written  some classic shit  but he's written  a lot of bullshit  and it's really  overshadowed him  I think he's still funny  or like he was funny  I don't know  when he went back  and hosted SNL  in the 90s  and he was doing  Tom Schneider  and all that  it was fucking hilarious 
[03:06:00]  yeah  Tom Schneider  bit was really funny  hold on  let me find  the Sinatra sketch  oh look at you go  give me some doobies  oh man that's right  you fucked up  that was a real resurgence  in SNL  was when they brought on  Will Ferrell  and Sherry Oteri  and everything  isn't that when  is that when  Phil Hartman was there too  this episode  yeah  I think Hartman  was there during that too  Phil Hartman was really  god damn  fucking funny  that son of a bitch  it's not gonna let you do that  oh look what happened 
[03:06:30]  we need admin rights  admin rights  come on  how about some track men  oh for Christ's sakes  is it on YouTube anywhere  it's probably on YouTube  no  they're very  there's no Piscopo Sinatra  it might be on Hulu  but they're very protective  Hulu  what's there a bunch of  hoops around there  dude the fucking  the Phil Hartman  Sinatra sketch  yeah  which one  the fucking Sinatra group  where he's running  the round table discussion 
[03:07:00]  oh yeah  and he just goes  Milli Vanilli  what's with this  faggot crap  right there  you can't even do that anymore  yeah  and then  Chris Rock is doing  Luther Campbell  and he's going  man  and Sajar just goes  I didn't get a word  yeah it was so funny man  what the hell is this  it's a commercial  that we have to watch  before the  see a lot of  look I'm just seeing  black people and Asians  this commercial 
[03:07:30]  or Bank of America  all right  that ain't the America  I know  no volume  how about some volume  what are you fucking home  enjoying yourself  I think this is it  I think this is the one  I was talking about  is that Phil  no this is Piscopo  this is the sketch  I was talking about  big American flag  yeah  it's time for you  it's time for you  he would do a good 
[03:08:00]  fucking Sinatra  I'll tell you  that dreams come true  come on baby  it's time  time  time  it's time  for you  that's fucking good  yeah  I think they made  that song up too  I probably didn't want  to pay for the rides  it's so spot on though  thank you very much  you're marvelous  thank you so much  ladies and gentlemen  this is Francis Albert  reminding you  that it is time  it's time 
[03:08:30]  that for all of us  to start buying  and driving  American cars  recently  I visited the Motor City  and I have to be  quite honest with you  that I did not like  what I saw  Kabish  thousands  thousands and thousands  of beautiful guys  and chicks  out of wake  because you are  not buying  American cars  now I'd like you  to meet one of the guys  that America forgot  if you'd be so kind  please welcome  from the United  Auto Workers of America  Jerry Hemphill  ladies and gentlemen  who's this guy

[03:10:30]  the funniest  is that how you're  remembering it  or is it  no  Tony Rosada  I think  it might be  my favorite  SNL sketch  that was 81  ever  really  no  I don't see it  what's that one  like the cold open  when they were  doing the opening  outside  that's  that's not  what you're  looking for  fuck yeah  I think the

[03:19:30]  that I know  nobody's going  to be traveling  or anything  I just really try  to  it is a rough  fucking night  to go out  drinking  a lot of people  it was packed  man  we packed out  this bar  it was great  the bar was  very grateful  because we brought  them all this  business  and you know  we had a great  time  it was a lot  of fun  but it was  hurting me  for a few  days  I was saying  to you  earlier  I can't  do it  like I used  to man  it's really  starting to slow  down  like I can't  it's fucking  it's hurting  for days  afterwards  I tied  one on  a couple  of nights  in Chicago 
[03:20:00]  and I just  I just don't  do that  here anymore  but when I  travel  forget about it  but it's very  difficult to get  up and be  functional  yeah all I can  think about is  like I have a  long day today  and then I  travel to Philly  then I have a  show and all I  can think about  is when I  get  he's fucking  making chip  faces  ready to go  listen man  I ain't saying  nothing  I'm so insecure  today that  anything  oh no  Dr. Steve  really fucking  got you  no it was  Dr. Steve  it was not 
[03:20:30]  being able to  remember words  I was trying  to say  it was saying  he doesn't  want to go  toe to toe  with chip  no but all  I can think  about is like  oh after the  show tonight  I can have  a few drinks  and because  it feels like  a vacation  even if you're  away working  yeah  I think  you're right  I wish I  could do  what you  do Jim  just straight  and narrow  that's it  serious  never drink  again  yeah I'm  serious  I wish I  could  I don't 
[03:21:00]  know  so many  of my  relationships  are forged  in it  that I  don't even  know what  to do  I wouldn't  know what  to do  for fun  I don't  know what  to do  it's the  only fun  I have  what do  you do  that's  true  is it  is it  is it  just  are you  a workaholic  or is it  just  yes  and a  sex addict  oh  yeah  that's  about it  that's  replaced  that clears  it up  yeah  I'm languishing  in irrelevancy  just getting  prostitutes  wondering why 
[03:21:30]  I'm not being  heard  I don't know  it's just  one of those  things where  like stopping  at 18  you pretty  much  do you know  anybody you  knew at 18  do you hang  out with anybody  you knew at 18  really  no  but I still  my one friend  who I know  is still sober  he got sober  I was in February  you know  it's one of those  things though  where I know  what Joe's saying  it's kind of  hard to  sure  because you're  you have these  friends that  still drink  and to think  of stopping 
[03:22:00]  you wouldn't be  able to hang  out with them  yeah  I don't keep  talking to anybody  from my past  really  yeah  my buddy  sobered up  recently  and he caught  we were talking  on the phone  the other day  and he goes  dude I haven't  seen you in  about  he goes  I haven't seen  you in a long  time  and he goes  funny  well he goes  he goes  it's funny  I think you  stopped hanging  out with me  right when I  stopped drinking  was that just  a coincidence  you know  we were laughing  about it  but it was like  all we ever  did was  once or twice  a month  we'd get out  and we'd go  out and we'd  get hammered  here's the thing  with drinking  and this is what's  so hard about  giving it up to me  not that I do it 
[03:22:30]  many nights in a week  it's just the  nights of socializing  or whatever  that I do do it  the thing that  attracts me to it  is if you take  it's the only thing  that can keep  it's a perpetual  activity that keeps  the night going  every other thing  sex  food  movie  whatever it is  they have a very  concrete end to them  and I always think  but what about  after that  what do I do  after that  there's only so much  to talk about 
[03:23:00]  there's only so long  to sit in a restaurant  there's only so much  food you get  whereas drinking  is like  this will go  up until the point  that I go  it's time to go to bed  the point  I pass out  you know  yeah I hear you  yeah yeah  same thing with  gambling  this will go  until I run out  of money  same thing with  sex  this will go  until I run out  of money  until I punch a chair  I come  or yeah  until Anthony  punches a chair  whatever  they all  are seen as ways  it's about avoidance 
[03:23:30]  they're all good ways  to avoid  just living in the moment  sex is one  and drink is one  they're all the same thing  I think sex is  a more finite one though  not if you edge  I can go hours  and hours  and hours  of just watching porn  and calling escorts  and not getting  not coming  I've gone through escorts  and had them come  and leave without coming  just don't want to  keep that high going  yeah but I know  it's not healthy  none of it's healthy  all that shit  gamblers don't walk away 
[03:24:00]  because they want to  keep the high going  we're all the same  please I just wanted  yeah it's all the same thing  oh  and then I lost  I punched a chair  I think I'm okay though  update on the hand  it was swollen pretty good  yeah yeah  you punched a chair  oh did I punch  a fucking chair  casino in Chicago  there's casinos in Chicago  who knew  outside Hammond Indiana  yeah Indiana  right over the border  but um  yeah  I was doing very well  then I didn't  do very well 
[03:24:30]  yeah  and I punched a  fucking chair  and my hand  just blew up  what did you lose  oh  could you say  or is it  oh  I could say  uh  would you lose  it rhymes with  Morty  thousand dollars  I  I  I  I  I  I had  a  a  a  10g  marker out  so  yeah  I was already  in the hole  10  and I  I 
[03:25:00]  but I had  two grand  left of the  10  2,000 left  of the  10,000  and I built  that up  to  60,000  60,000  60  6  0  thousand  dollars  I  then  proceeded  to dump  it  yes  oh my god  I dumped  it back  down to the  but but when I  was up to 60  I took 10  because that was  my marker  and I gave it to  Keith to hold  on to  and I said 
[03:25:30]  you know  hold that  and we'll pay  the marker  with it  so now you're  up 50  I'm up 50  g's  which I then  lost  then  we go to  cash out  or actually  pay the marker  so we walk up  to the cage  looking at  10  $1,000  chips  what's that  and  I  I  and Keith  went  what's that  I'm fucked up  I thought I heard  something  oh Jesus  he's suited  so  I  when Keith 
[03:26:00]  went to the  bathroom  and they're  filling out  all the paperwork  for the markers  I said  I went  hold on  I'll be right  back  and I grabbed  the 10 grand  I walked up  to a table  I plopped it  right down  and said  deal  oh come on  and the woman  dealt the cards  Anthony  and I got  an 18  and the dealer  was showing  a 5  turned over  the down card  and she got  15  flipped over  another card  and it was  indeed a 10  so she  busted  and I got  $10,000  and I walked 
[03:26:30]  back to the cage  and paid my marker  and left with 10 grand  yeah  but I  but a guy like Anthony  doesn't see it as  winning 10 grand  he sees it as  losing 40  40,000  I punched  the chair  after I lost  the 50,000  now let me ask you this  yeah  and is the answer  just as simple  as addiction  is it that simple  but I mean  Jesus Christ  when you're staring  at 50 grand  I get it  you don't want  the night to end  you want to keep  playing  you want to keep  having fun  but what  aside from addiction 
[03:27:00]  is there anything  that doesn't make you  walk away and go  well I can go buy a car  with this right now  and then  I'll take 10 grand  and  take the 40  I'll take another 10  and I'll go play  the low stakes blackjack table  and have drinks  and have fun  and laugh  and fuck it  I'll bet like an idiot  over there  and maybe I'll win  a few more grand  or lose a few  who gives a shit  but I'm still out  I'm still playing  I'm still drinking  and I just bought myself  a fucking $40,000 car  why then didn't I leave 
[03:27:30]  at 10,000  or 20,000  or 30,000  because 50,000  is the gateway  to 60,000  and 70  and 80  and 90  and 100  so why would I stop  when I could build that up  and make twice as much  as I have  sitting on the table  I see  it's the gambler's mentality  that's the thing  if I ever  yeah it's called  being an asshole  it's hard to walk away though  yeah  it's hard  there have been days  where I have left 
[03:28:00]  and it did work out  that way  where I left with  a lot of fucking money  and  my yard  is a testimony  to that  a testament  to that  there  yeah  I love when guys  do that with the money  when I hear a guy go  you know I won 10 grand  in Vegas  and you go  would you do it  and he goes  ah dude  I rented a boat  for us one day  I took everybody  I'm like you're a fucking moron  I had the best trip  it paid for itself 
[03:28:30]  did it  did it  was it worth buying that boat  for two days  you fucking idiot  take it home  and buy something  there's nothing better  than going  I have all this extra money  to blow on something  I don't need  yeah  like that I can keep though  and enjoy for the rest  of my fucking life  no one  when you win money gambling  you don't consider it  money  it's just this amazing  free stuff  so you just  you know  but you did something smart  with you  you paid for a yard  yeah 
[03:29:00]  that's like an awesome thing  you can always look at  and go  yeah  you know  that was  care of the poor god  very nice  that's also something  that'll keep you gambling  I can get another yard  I know  I can get another one  it's great  I really was  kind of like  because it took  all fucking night  to build up  that stack  and it took  literally  two shoes  two fucking  deals of the shoes  to lose it  it just  it wouldn't  she hit a 
[03:29:30]  fucking streak  that was just  playing blackjack  blackjack  yeah of course  yeah I got a buddy  who consistently  does this at casinos  yeah  every time  him and my friend go  they come back  and I go  what happened  and he goes  dude  John was up  at the craps  he was up  20 grand  at the craps table  and he lost  all of it  like he consistently  fucking does it  consistently  never walks away  with the money  yeah it's tough  especially when  the only time  I've walked away  with the money  is when  like Keith goes  we gotta go 
[03:30:00]  we're going now  we have a plane  to catch  we gotta have  a car to catch  or something  I'm like  oh okay  well I'm ahead  so I guess I won  but then  you know  it's like  alright I'll cash out  now what  I'm gonna walk  around this place  watch the old ladies  pull the fucking  slot machine handles  it's uh  I mean  yeah  I've gotten  to a place  with gambling  I hate casinos  I don't like it  I don't like being  in them anymore  I don't go to casinos  unless something's  going on 
[03:30:30]  I don't just go  to go  hey I'm gonna go  up and gamble  and stuff  the only time  I gamble  is when Jimmy's  doing a show  or you know  my brother  is playing  somewhere  or we're  doing an appearance  where a casino  is like  really close  but I don't  just go  hey I'm going  to Atlantic City  this weekend  to gamble  my whole philosophy  with that shit  is you know  everybody always  says like  well what you  gotta do  is you gotta  go and you  gotta say  I'm not gonna  let myself  lose more  than this  and it's like  okay well  let's say  you do that  you can still  lose that amount  of money  in no time  literally 10 minutes 
[03:31:00]  10 minutes  if you're not  smart about it  then what do you  do you still  gotta stand there  and then that's  like you're  at Disney World  but you're not  allowed to go  on the rides  you're just gonna  watch everybody  else have fun  so it's either  that or it's  like oh I'm  in a position  where I can  afford to gamble  whatever I feel  like and then  well then there's  no thrill in winning  at that point  if you're that  financially stable  like who gives  a shit about  the money really  so then it  really just  comes down to  do you enjoy  winning this game  or not  you know what I  mean and no  I don't give  that much of a  fuck about it 
[03:31:30]  like you know  like it's  I just don't  enjoy it  and I never  gamble right  because I'm  too scared  to so I  gamble like a  pussy and I  just lose  yeah you need  you need some  brass balls  to really make  a good steak  oh sure  it's crazy  yeah I do  like the I like  the game I like  when there's a  good table  when it comes  to like winning  a little bit  yeah I'd  rather  I'd rather  play like 
[03:32:00]  blackjack  with a good  table  yeah  there's nothing  worse when there's  that one doof  at the table  a doof  well there's that  one guy  sometimes if you're  at a table  there's that one  guy sitting there  going I don't  believe that you  play against  as a group  against the  dealer  I believe that  you play  individually  there are guys  out there that  are good  efficient gamblers  in the sense  that they win  that have that  mentality  of like  where they don't  subscribe to  those rules  of like  dude if she  shows a 2  you always  hit on that  and don't  give a fuck 
[03:32:30]  that he took  your 10  or whatever  those guys  stink  I hate those  they're right  though  numerically  they're right  play the game  right  no meaning  that you are  just playing  against your  card against  the card  of the dealer  fuck everybody  else  no  you don't  mean that  I do  no that's  terrible  play the game  properly  god damn it  that's terrible  Jim  no no meaning  that you just  play against  the  but then it  fucks you up  but I don't  believe in  like I think  numerically  it all balances  out  like you don't 
[03:33:00]  I think it does  too  but no he is  part of a team  it pisses people  off when you're  not playing the  game right  yeah  what's he say  I'm going out  there for myself  so when you run  out of money  that guy next to  you give you  some  fuck him  I love this  fucking  Bronx tale  but he doesn't  let me tell you  something  does that guy  give you money  when you're broke  but he doesn't  fuck him  holy beans  John  you read  you're right  John  voice right  I say  can I plug

[03:44:30]  her on  Facebook  yeah I'm  actually typing  and writing  out to her  what are you  writing  something dirty  on the  air  what'd you  write  I let her  know I'm  on the air  oh okay  so exactly  what you  said okay  you just  said it  a little  silly  I was  just saying  what I  was typing  to her  I haven't  heard you  on O&A  in a while  what's been  the deal  with that  oh it's  not been  you it's  been O&A  that haven't  been asking  you  that's just 
[03:45:00]  people right  yeah because  I'm sure  if they  asked me  they said  you'd be  right okay  that's cool  I know  they would  I know  it'd be  easier for  me to get  on if I  went to  one of  your guys  broadcast  but I  didn't go  to Chicago  obviously  that was  unfortunate  you were  missed too  we were  actually  talking  backstage  we were  like you  know that  show was  almost perfect  I just  wish Bobo  had been  around  yeah well  I heard  I heard  nothing about  about me  anywhere being  mentioned  all right  no no  what I  even asked  all right 
[03:45:30]  Bobo  it's nice  to hear from  you I'll  talk to  you later  uh  Adam  Richmond's  outside  bring him  on in  oh what's  up Travis  it's just  me  I just  wanted to  know if  the if  the girl  who joined  Facebook  23 hours  ago and  has a  stock  photo  got back  to  Bobo  yet  Adam  yeah come  in sit  down  wherever  you can  sit down  right there  where Travis  is  yeah  how's it  going  we're on  the air  now so  jump into  it  you're on  television  you're not  going to  suck  they can  really  you're on 
[03:46:00]  basic cable  you must be  brilliant  they can  make a show  out of  anything  they have  yeah  I saw a clip  from that  Honey Boo Boo  here comes  Honey Boo Boo  whatever else  I've been hearing  about it  yeah  yeah it  definitely  made me feel  like the  most evolved  human  on planet  I was like  my god  I'm a  NASA scientist  how did  how did  Man vs.  Food  the show  that made  you famous  how did  you get  that show  I auditioned  so what  somebody was  like oh  I have this  premise for a  show where  a guy  eat a bunch  of crap  no actually  it was really  funny I  never did a 
[03:46:30]  challenge before  the first one  I did on  camera  I went to  Yale drama  school got  my master's  in 03  oh so you  wanted to be  like an  actor actor  yeah and I  was doing that  actually since  96 like  paying my rent  and stuff but  I wanted to  get a master's  to a kind of  get my family  off my back  but also to  know that  like if I  wanted to do  it for a  career I  could I  could make  a living  and you  do showcases  when you  come out of  the big drama  schools and  got signed  and my agents  would periodically  send out these  big mass  emails like  you know  such and such 
[03:47:00]  a network  looking for  blonde  multilingual  spanish-speaking  scuba diver  who can also  whistle like  you know what  I mean  right right  and so they  sent something  out and it  said looking  for somebody  who knows  food knows  regional food  can describe  flavors well  has kitchen  and acting  experience  so I've been  working in  kitchens since  I'm 13 years  old and when  you grow up  in Brooklyn  even in New  York in general  you grow up a  little bit of  everything you  know there's  like first  generation  communities  everywhere you 
[03:47:30]  go to  Sunset Park  it's like being  in China  you go to  Atlantic Avenue  it's like being  in Iran  I mean it's  really quite  remarkable  so I've been  working in the  industry since  I'm 13  and been  working as an  actor off  an awesome  nine  and I  auditioned  and the audition  didn't have to do  with a big  challenge  you had to go  and describe  something  you could bring  food in  describe the  flavor  well I guess  that's a big  part of it  too just  describing what  the food  is  exactly  and also  I love  culinary  anthropology  which is  probably  the dorkiest  least sexy  statement  I've ever 
[03:48:00]  made next  to I  have a  Pez  collection  which is  also true  both are  true  so your  hobbies are  collecting  Pez  dispensers  and culinary  anthropology  really describes  my dating  life in  high school  very  very accurately  what is  culinary  anthropology  I know  it sounds  like the  douchiest  thing  ever  but  I  actually  saw it  on a  food  network  show  once  this  woman  it's  really  the  study  of a  people  or  culture  but  using  food  as  the  point  of  departure  and  I  know  it  sounds  kind of  silly  and  austere  but  food  is  something  I  dig  food  is  something  that 
[03:48:30]  I  appreciate  and  I  would  much  rather  study  that  than  their  artwork  or their  cave  paintings  which is  a bonus  it's  thoroughly  interactive  so I  pretty much  just checked  into the  third floor  of the  Grand  Army Plaza  library  in Brooklyn  and started  teaching it  to myself  so when I  auditioned  I brought  in a  mole burrito  and I was  able to  talk about  Oaxacan  flavors  talk about  chilis  and chocolate  talking about  the origins  of burritos  and fajitas  and stuff  like this  just the  other day  I had to  give our  interns a  pep talk  about going  the extra 
[03:49:00]  mile  and actually  you know  doing something  not just  sitting there  and waiting  until somebody  asks you  to do  something  this is  exactly  what I'm  talking about  what Adam  Richmond did  is actually  go home  do some  homework  and figure  your shit  out before  you get  to the  audition  that way  you know  what you're  doing  you don't  just show  up and be  like well  what do  you want  me to  do  this  you know  I had a  really great  director  that I  worked  with  the year  my dad  passed  I was  an acting  apprentice  at Actors  Theater  and I  love this  artistic  director  named John  Joy  said the  coolest  shit  to me  ever  he said  an audition  is not a 
[03:49:30]  new age  experience  it's a  competition  you're there  to get a  job  you're not  there to  flex some  artistic  muscle  or to  grow  you are  there to  work  and how  well you  do that  day  will determine  how much  of your  rent you can  pay that  day  how much  medical  insurance  you get  the audition  part  isn't  where the  integrity  lies  it's just  delivering  what they  want  right  and making  yourself  known  actually  there's a  really funny  story about  my audition  for man  versus food  so the  final screen  test  now we're  going to  the sixth  round  of my  audition  process  because they  kept 
[03:50:00]  winnowing  down  it was  like a  field  of a  couple  hundred  to like  70  to 40  to 30  to 20  to 6  to 4  to 2  to myself  and  I  knew it  was going  to be  a cat's  deli  I'm a  Jew  with roots  to lower  east  side  so I  was like  Under Armour  protect this  house  I basically  showed up  at cat's  deli  the day  before  and I  interviewed  everybody  just on my  own  took as  many notes  as I  could  but I 
[03:50:30]  bought a  t-shirt  I cut  the neck  out of  the t-shirt  and I  spent five  bucks  and I  was a  poor  ass  actor  that five  bucks  is a  commitment  and I  laundered  this shirt  dinner  and breakfast  and I  laundered  this shirt  over and  over and  over again  to make  it look  old and  worn out  and I  wore a  black hoodie  to my  audition  they asked  us to do  what became  the beginning  of every  restaurant  segment of  man versus  food  that was  like walking  intros  so I did  an intro  to cat's  deli and  then I  said at  the end  of the  thing  I go  after all  these facts 
[03:51:00]  that I  had memorized  I said  oh and  if you  think I'm  reading this  off a  cue card  or if  I'm just  a fan  I unzip  my t-shirt  and I  show the  I unzip  my sweater  and I  show the  t-shirt  and I'm  like this  is my  t-shirt  big fan  so flash  forward to  the end  of season  one and  I'm speaking  to the  former vice  president  of the  network  and they're  talking to  me about  screening  the  audition  they said  man you  know that  moment  where you  unzipped your  hoodie and  you're like  that's my  t-shirt  that's when we  were like  we knew  we got  the guy  yeah  I was like  about that  that was  bull  it wasn't  mine  it had been  mine for 
[03:51:30]  a day  a day  a day  I watched  this is our  handsome Rob  do you hear  that he  actually  he didn't  go and say  oh what do  you want me  to do  he found  a t-shirt  and he  figured it  out himself  be inspired  okay  there's role  models all  around you  and I like  that you're  addicting  the handsome  Rob  that's pretty  he's a handsome  guy  is he not  you know  honestly I  would share  a jail cell  with you  yeah  yeah  now  you've  created  like this  empire  because  I was just  talking to  Roland  Roland is 
[03:52:00]  like the  biggest foodie  in the world  this is  Roland  and  him and  our buddy  Iraq who  was just  in here  a minute  ago  he's right  through the  glass  they're very  jealous  of the  empire  and the  career  that you've  created  for yourself  because  this is  what you  do  for a  living  now  and now  you have  the new  show  which is  you become  famous  and have  this audience  for man  versus food  everybody  now respects  your opinion  on  foods  and so  you're now  doing  America's  best  sandwich  right  actually  it's my  is  Adam  Richmond's  best  sandwich  in  America  because  this is  just 
[03:52:30]  my  call  I think  people keep  thinking  I think  I'm a  burning bush  instead of  a basic  cable food  host  and the  thing is  it's like  look  I've worked  in the  industry  since I'm  13  I've kept  a culinary  journal  since  1994  of all the  places  I eat  what do  you do  in the  journal  you know  it  started  when a  girl  really broke  my heart  real badly  in college  and I  bought  one of  those  blank books  and I  was going  to write  douchey  college  breakup  poetry  right  I've done  it  yeah  we all  you know  you write  like AFI  lyrics  basically  you're like  you know  barbed wire  rains for my  eye  get out of  here  right  so I 
[03:53:00]  used to  go on  drives  and I  found  this  amazing  place  in  Atlanta  Georgia  where  I  went  to  undergrad  at  Emory  and I  hadn't  seen  I  hadn't  seen  this  place  before  and I  started  writing  and I  was  it was  kind of  like a  diary  entry  but it  used  food  as the  point  of  departure  and  I  still  got  my  feelings  out  but  it  was  a  little  bit  more  culinary  exploration  and I  realized  this  is a  passion  that  moves  me  and it  kind  of  opens  me  up  and  makes  me  a better  person  and makes  me a more  articulate  communicator  and so  then I  just  started  doing it 
[03:53:30]  and then  it became  first  like  friends  would say  hey I  know you  got that  book you've  been working  on with  all your  restaurants  my folks  are coming  in town  where can  we eat  then it  was  you know  hey  this is  what people  do with  Roland  Roland  has memorized  like every  place in  New York  City  and then  the best  you're like  an encyclopedia  and then  every time  we go  out of town  like we  were just  in Chicago  last weekend  and Roland  is sitting  there  he's researching  restaurants  and that's  all he does  where'd you  go in Chicago  we didn't have  enough time  to go anywhere  really  that's what  sucked  but he knew  the spots  like he knew  where he wanted  to go  he just didn't  get there 
[03:54:00]  but that's  the thing  is that  once you  do that  and that's  the nice  part about  man versus  food  and man  versus  food  nation  and Adam  mission's  best  sandwich  is that  these places  are accessible  they're no  reservation  you know  taking type  places  apologies  Anthony  for the  reference  to the  old show  but I  think that  that's the  thing  it's like  sandwiches  are accessible  every culture  has got  them  every income  bracket  has got  them  our moms  made them  for lunch  for us  we make  them  and we're  hungover  with what  we have  around the  house  and it's  really a bit 
[03:54:30]  of a travel  log  even my books  I always make  sure I put  the addresses  I put the  you know  the phone  numbers  I put a map  in there  and I want  it to be  user friendly  and I think  that's the  thing  I'll explore  and I'll show  you where  the great  stuff is  would you ever  publish something  like that  I have  the first  book I did  was called  America the  edible  and I did  kind of  10 culinary  snapshots  but the  one that's  the closest  to tonight's  finale  is my  second book  which is  called  Quest for  the Best  and it's  about finding  the best  of each  iconic food  in each  city  so best  deep dish  in Chicago 
[03:55:00]  best  key lime  pie  in Key  West  best  crab  cake  in Baltimore  best  shrimp  po'boy  in New  Orleans  stuff like  that  so  the big  finale  by the  way  is  9 o'clock  tonight  10 regional  winners  2 wild  cards  big karate  kid board  and one  sandwich  will remain  alone  you get to  name  the greatest  sandwich  in America  I'm pretty  you know  this of all  the ones  I've tried  the sandwich  that won  I really  feel  really deserves  to  I think  that it's  prepared  extraordinarily 
[03:55:30]  well  each  element  the bread  the cheese  the whatever  it all works  together  really well  what's been the  worst  what's been the  most difficult  thing about  specifically  man versus  food  because man  versus food  is the one  where basically  you go into  these places  that have the  local challenges  like eat  165 pounds  of ice cream  in half an  hour and you  get a t-shirt  and you just  find places  that have them  and you do it  what was the  worst  because you've  you've vomited  on several  different episodes  no only one 
[03:56:00]  only one  was that the  worst then  no actually  which is really  kind of  depressing  no no no  that was just  that was an  average Wednesday  you know the  spicy ones  really were the  ones that had  like real  lasting  I only lost  one spicy  challenge that  was in Sarasota  and those wings  were really bad  but we actually  caught the owner  on his his mic  was still open  and he actually  could have hurt  me he he was  using extract  which to me  is a shortcut  I think that  that's a little  bit of a cop 
[03:56:30]  out because you  could put extract  on a bread  stick and make  a challenge out  of it  yeah  but he had  ghost chili  extract  and he actually  my director  was new at that  point and he  didn't have the  presence of  I had to stop  the challenge  and go and  address this  and the guy  said yo let's  just add the  rest of the  bottle  and he put  an entire  bottle of ghost  chili extract  because he didn't  want you to win  he wanted to make  it look like  this place was  right not  not realizing  that the places  I win do  better  is that right  yeah because  people think  hey if that  schmuck can do  what I can do  it  it's just so 
[03:57:00]  funny that you're  describing like your  whole journey of  how you got here  and studying acting  and all this stuff  because that's how  it comes across on  TV and I think  that's how it's  intended to come  across that  you're just some  schmuck who likes  to go eat  and you found a  camera crew  something like that  I mean as long as  I'm like a lovable  likable  semi-informed  schmuck  I'll take it  yeah  you know what I  mean  there are few  things I found  as toxic as  caring what other  people think about  you as long as  you know look  I'm smart enough  to know that  I get a chance  to work and to  have my dream job  because my fans 
[03:57:30]  let me  and I think  that there's a  debt of respect  that I owe them  and I feel that  as long as I'm  respectful of them  and I put my  game face on  everyone was always  like oh you must  be getting high  before challenges  of course not  first of all  I have freakishly  large eyes  you would definitely  be able to tell  second of all  I have a union  film crew with me  I'm the executive  producer of the show  the degree of  unprofessionalism  if I did that  it sure changes  the viewer as much  as my crew  how'd you get  that  how'd you get  executive producer 
[03:58:00]  credit on the show  Man vs. Food Nation  was the first thing  I did  honestly  when I got the  job of Man vs. Food  I was working at  Madison Square Garden  Television  and I had worked  for the Olympics  ironically enough  in 1996  in a broadcast capacity  so I'd studied  broadcast before  and once they saw  that I wasn't  just meat puppet  you know  that I could just  sort of  not bump into  furniture  and say my lines  in a relatively  non-crappy way  once they realized  that I could actually  produce  and I knew how to  work a schedule  and knew how to  work with crew  and do shot 
[03:58:30]  composition  and work cameras  I mean I shot  about 20% of the  B-roll that you  ever saw  in season one  yeah  so that was  really it  I think that it  was just sort of  an earned title  this is the  ultimate irony here  you worked in a  behind the scenes  capacity at the  96 Olympics  our pal  E-Rock in there  worked in a  behind the scenes  capacity at the  96 Olympics  you now have a  television show  where you're  naming the best  sandwich in America  which is tonight  and E-Rock  gets made fun of 
[03:59:00]  on a daily basis  for the weight  he has put on  because he sits  at home eating  sandwiches by himself  that's the fork  that you guys got to  my derision  sticks to Twitter  it's all on Twitter  it's kind of hard to  cut out carbs  in a sandwich  E-Rock  does this upset you  does this make you  jealous  or are you inspired  well I am inspired  but I'm also a little  disappointed that  he's on the sandwich  bandwagon way before  I was  what do you mean  he got the show  he's doing this whole  show about just  going around eating 
[03:59:30]  sandwiches  I'm like why didn't  I think of that  somewhere he's got  Eric's got a notebook  ideas for shows  jello  sandwiches  you know the truth  of the matter is  when Man vs. Food  Nation ended  and everyone was  throwing these  concepts at me  about what the  next show could be  it was all very  derivative  it was like  top chef meets  chopped  chopped meets  iron chef  it was just  very very typical  and I called my  buddy who's my  co-executive producer  who I actually  auditioned for  all those  years back there  at Katz's Deli  and I said  dude look  people use the 
[04:00:00]  show as a  travelogue  people love  sandwiches  we know them  we make them  we don't have to  complicate this  let's just focus  on the greatest  sandwiches there are  so how do you  feel as somebody  who's a trained  actor to have  now kind of  your career  went in this  weird place  and now you've  created the  Man vs. Food  Empire  do you feel like  I love it's an  empire  it is because  you got the  three shows now  and you're the  guy  it's on every  week and we  watch  and I appreciate  that  it's amazing 
[04:00:30]  I'm still  you know  I still do  some of the  legit stuff  I'm attached  to a couple  pilots and  projects and  stuff like this  because it's  something I still  love and something  I'm passionate  about but I'm  also I'm smart  enough to make  hay while the  sun's shining  and I'm not  going to sit  there and go  forget sandwiches  I must do  Shakespeare  look if you're  going to be the  man vs. Food  guy you better  make the most  out of it  right  and that I  think is probably  the difficult  thing is that  you know now  I just would  much rather  much like  Andrew and  Tony before  me eventually  just sort of  cultivate my 
[04:01:00]  own realm and  just be Adam  Richmond as  opposed to like  when Andrew  started Andrew  Zimmern was the  guy who ate  balls and bugs  and now he's  really he's a  two-time James  Beard award  winner a really  accomplished chef  good dude and  I think that you  know now I  still know that I  have a success in  the food space I  want to continue it  but I want to  explore other  avenues in it  and maybe put  the big challenges  behind me a little  bit yeah Roland  you've seen him go  to a lot of  different places  you've seen him  rate the  sandwiches throughout  the season of 
[04:01:30]  Adam Richmond's  best sandwich  any thoughts  any criticisms  because you also  are a connoisseur  of regional  you know I just  get jealous of  when he goes to  Dallas that  barbecue sandwich  oh yeah  that pulled pork  and then the  brisket  oh that was  oh no it was  in Driftwood  Driftwood yeah  Salt Lake yeah  Salt Lake is  jealousy worthy  Salt Lake is  arguably one of  the best eating  establishments in  the country just  it's one of the  last remaining  open pits in  the entire country  yeah and the 
[04:02:00]  fact that the  man who built  it is still the  guy cooking it  and and I love  like the little  tricks that they  do you know he  has wood and  they soak some  of the wood in  the sauce and it  steams up if  the flame gets  too high they take  wet pecan shells  throw that on  the fire so  the pecan  flavored smoke  they hang the  sausages above  so that drips  down onto the  coals so then  that flavor goes  up through the  meat I mean it's  such an incredible  operation there  that you know you  see and that's  just one of 30
