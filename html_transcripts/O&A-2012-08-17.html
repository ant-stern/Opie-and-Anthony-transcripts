<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Norton blamed his sleeplessness on excessive pretzel consumption, which segued into a discussion of films like *Donnie Brasco* (praising Pacino and Depp, criticizing AMC's editing), and *As Good as It Gets*, leading to a debate about movies mentioning their own titles.  The conversation then turned to the reality show *Stars and Stripes*, mocking the contestants' struggles, particularly Terry Crews and a *Biggest Loser* trainer's failure in a swimming challenge, prompting racially charged commentary.  Other participants like Dean Cain, Layla Ali, and Todd Palin were also discussed.  Finally, Norton detailed his new hobby: quadcopter drones, discussing their capabilities and potential for illegal use, before showing various online videos.  Colin Quinn was announced as a later guest.

The show continued with anticipation for guests Sherrod Small (his first appearance) and Rich Vos.  Opie graphically described his upcoming scrotal skin tag removal surgery.  Vos briefly joined before a break, followed by a segment of "F-You" calls, filled with listener-submitted insults.  A significant portion detailed the misbehavior of intern Eric, who repeatedly farted on-air and downloaded bikini pictures.  The hosts graphically described Eric's flatulence and the resulting air freshener use, highlighting the generally unsanitary intern workspace.  Discussion then turned to an Ashley Dupree *New York Post* cover, Norton's nicotine gum use, sexual exploits, anxiety attacks, Klonopin use, and a comparison of the relative harms of nicotine gum versus unprotected sex.  Colin Quinn joined, leading to a playful argument with Norton about his drinking habits and potential alcoholism.  Quinn and Norton discussed their careers and self-perception.  Vos recounted a story about getting sick from clams at a state fair, leading to his wife's humorous tweets.  His Broadway experience, frugality, his wife's TV career, a rejected TV show, and his negotiation skills were also discussed, along with a running gag about mispronouncing "Borgias."

A subsequent segment focused on Joe Biden's campaign gaffes, particularly his racially charged language.  Vos joined the discussion, debating whether the gaffes were intentional or age-related.  This led to tangents about Matt Lauer's early career (with inaccurate claims about MTV), Vos's nicotine gum addiction, Biden's resemblance to Jeff Dunham's puppet Walter, political media bias, Vos's stand-up career, Andrew Dice Clay ejecting an audience member, the misspelling of "McGuire's" on Vos's website, Vos's sex life and golf affecting his performance, a crack cocaine experience, and references to other comedians like Norton, Quinn, and Lynch.  The humor stemmed from the hosts' and Vos's personalities and their rapid-fire, often nonsensical interactions.

A largely improvised segment followed, with Quinn and Norton present.  The conversation started with underwear preferences, moving to aging and ailments, then to movie preferences (*Bourne Legacy*), the lack of originality in modern movies, Grammy nominations (Vos's album), his ex-wife's parenting success, a county fair recollection, comedian comparisons, and a discussion of Vos's claimed 141 IQ, leading to a debate on IQ tests and a proposed live IQ test.  The segment was filled with arguments, insults, name-calling, discussions of Vos's podcast, and promotion of his comedy appearances.  It concluded with more insults, banter, promotional announcements, and plans to attend an intern's pool party, including a brief advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers.

The final segment featured Sam Tripoli.  He discussed the differences between East and West Coast stand-up, noting the brutal competitiveness of the East Coast, recounting experiences with Norton, Vos, Quinn, and Small. He contrasted this with LA's perceived passive-aggressiveness.  He spoke of his career, honesty, hard work, and frustration over Coca-Cola using a joke from his special in a radio ad.  The hosts and Tripoli discussed a clip of Brooke Hogan falling during Impact Wrestling, and infamous wrestling falls, like the Shockmaster's debut.  A large portion focused on show employee Troy moving and giving away his belongings, with listener calls to win items, including vases from his ex-girlfriend's deceased mother, one containing a drowned mouse.  Troy's DJ gigs were also mentioned.  The final segment involved more listener calls for the remaining vases, discussions of Tripoli's career (including his time with Chelsea Handler), humorous back-and-forth about intelligence, with Bonnie winning a vase.  The show concluded with announcements and plans.

[00:05:00]  There's laughter, fun, and jocularity going on up in this joint.  Yo.  I'm going to use some black dialect.  Okay.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  Jimmy Norton.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm a tired Jimmy Norton.  Oh.  Are you all sleep ridden?  I've been up since we did my show.  I might have slept in two hours.  No way.  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  What happened?  Just get caught up in things. 
[00:05:30]  Did you have, were you sharing time with somebody?  No.  Or were you at the solo?  I did Red Eye last night.  And I just, I guess I had pretzels too late and the salt kept me awake.  Uh, the salt kept you awake?  I think so.  How does that work?  Oh, those pretzels are great.  Sure, sure.  You start out with pretzels.  Then you've got a barbiturates or amphetamines.  Yeah.  So you were, you were kept awake by pretzels.  I think the salt does it to me.  Is there anything in the salt?  What does salt do? 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  Sugar keeps you awake.  What's the chemistry behind that?  I thought Kenny said it.  Blood pressure.  What, what, blood pressure.  What does salt increase your blood pressure or is it a thing that compiles over the years  to, is it like a, if you have a lot of salt, your blood pressure goes up that, that day?  I don't know.  And how many, Dr. Kenny?  How many pretzels did you eat for the salt on a pretzel to increase your blood pressure  to the point that you couldn't sleep?  I had 18 helping.  No, no, I had one helping. 
[00:06:30]  Did you have a heap in helping?  I had a helping of pretzels.  Greater than a serving size?  Yeah, man.  I thought I ate too many.  Too many pretzels?  Yeah.  He's, he's coming in to work tired and pretzels.  Just too many pretzels.  Too many pretzels.  I've never heard that.  I couldn't, uh, I couldn't sleep, man.  Uh, yeah, wow.  Fuck, dude.  That sucks.  Oh, I was watching Donnie Brasco.  Oh, I was watching that too.  That was on, yeah.  It's great on, on AMC where they just hear a little friggin', you know. 
[00:07:00]  Well, uh, um, what was on right before that?  Uh, Goodfellas was on AMC right before that.  And I was just laughing at the horrid editing.  They, but they, at least they don't put other words in.  They just cut it out of Goodfellas.  But AMC stinks, dude.  It does.  It's terrible.  What do they do?  Is that Turner's network?  Um, I'm not sure.  I don't, I think Turner has TMC.  TM, a Turner movie classic.  Movie classic.  Yeah.  AMC fucking blows.  Cause Donnie Brasco, I forgot how great that movie is.  That's a great movie.  It's one of the best things he's ever done. 
[00:07:30]  It's so underrated.  Yeah, it really is.  Think about all the mob movies.  It's sort of prick.  It's never one of, like, the five that are brought up, you know.  But it should be.  I was watching, and I didn't watch the end.  I watched, I kept saying, all right, one more commercial break.  And you just can't, every, it's like, oh yeah, this is a good scene.  That's a good scene.  But there's one scene with Pacino where they're down there.  They go to the King's Court.  Uh-huh.  And they find it.  And Pacino's just kind of talking about how he's not getting this thing.  Like, you know, even a dog gets a hot spot on the sidewalk.  And he's doing this thing where he's just kind of, he's like looking around and to the  left of the camera. 
[00:08:00]  And it's like, it's, it's, it's like what a good actor thing that was.  Is it sort of like a, like, yeah, he's just looking around.  Like he's just kind of looking at the room.  Yeah.  But you really feel like you're sitting in the room and he's looking past you.  That's cool, yeah.  I'm like, what a great fucking actor.  I mean, that's, that's.  What would you do, just stare into the lens?  Not only would I stare.  Give me the dialogue.  I would stare into the lens.  And I would actually, after I set my line, go, scene.  They just have to put a noise in after I talk so I don't say scene. 
[00:08:30]  That would be terrible.  Just stare into the camera.  Oh, it's in Chinese.  Yeah, what the hell is that?  It's just the subtitles.  Oh, subtitles.  It's in English.  His fucking hair was so fucking awful in this.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you meant now.  He was so good.  Yeah.  What about Sonny?  Oh.  Donnie.  Don't tell me what to do, Donnie.  Oh, this is not it.  Maybe a little bit beyond it.  Donnie, Sonny's down here for vacation.  I don't remember.  This was a nerve-wracking movie, too. 
[00:09:00]  It's so stressful.  Like, oh, he's going to get caught.  Oh, they're going to be on to him.  Yeah, I do like that one.  I love Al Pacino in this.  He didn't win the Oscar, of course.  No.  Why would he?  Was he even nominated?  I don't know.  Johnny Depp was awesome in that, too.  Yeah.  Well, you know, ever since 21 Jump Street, he's done no wrong.  He was good in a movie called, we've talked about it before, because he did a movie with  Brando, liked him a lot, called Don Juan DeMarco. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, right, yeah.  Which was, and I remember, I watched what these actors do, like, it's just so amazing to me,  it's so hard.  But there's one scene where Brando's talking to him, the doctor, and the doctor does something  that really annoys Brando.  And the doctor walks away, and Brando goes, I'm very angry at you.  And you know that any other actor would have yelled at, I'm very angry at you.  But Brando said it as sweetly, I'm very angry at you.  I'm like, that's why he was so great, because he was just so fucking different. 
[00:10:00]  That was only nominated, Donnie Brasco was nominated for one Oscar, and it was for writing.  It's amazing that Pacino wasn't nominated yet.  He was amazing in that.  Yeah.  Who won in 2000, let's say in 97, what won?  It would have been 98.  Oh!  It came out in 97.  Really?  So it would have been 97, I think.  No, it would have been 98.  Really?  It would have been the 98 Academy Awards.  But it's the 71st annual Academy Awards. 
[00:10:30]  Wouldn't that be considered the 97?  Well, if the movie comes out in 97, the Oscars are in like February of the following year.  So doesn't that count as the 97 Academy Awards?  Celebrating the year of 1997.  Yeah, but it was in 98.  Okay.  Oh, just fight.  Ugh, are you kidding?  That was the best picture?  What was?  Hang on, hang on.  I think I saw it.  You better be right.  You better fucking be right.  So Nicholson won for as good as it gets.  All right, what else was nominated?  Uh, Matt Damon.  You make me want to be a better man. 
[00:11:00]  It's a good movie.  It is.  It is a good movie.  But it wasn't.  That's probably the only like rom-com type movie that I really do like.  Yeah.  And for those of you at home, you missed Travis's air quotes.  Yes, you did air quotes.  You did air quotes.  You're right.  I thought that finger should fall off.  That movie has the thing that I hate more than anything in movies where they.  Cuba Gooding Jr.?  No.  People with good hair?  I saw him in an airport lounge recently.  I wanted to say hi to him, but I chickened out.  You don't like Cuba Gooding? 
[00:11:30]  No.  Travis is making that up.  I don't care about Cuba Gooding Jr. one way or the other.  When they reference the title of the movie in the movie, at one point, Jack Nicholson  says, what if this is as good as it gets?  As good as it gets.  That's just for the trailers.  Yeah, I know.  And they put it in the trailers and everything.  I hate it when movies put the title of the movie in the movie.  Godfather did it.  This is one word.  Titanic.  Good fellas.  Oh, that's terrible.  Donnie Brasco.  That's the name of the person.  Exactly. 
[00:12:00]  Matrix.  Stop or my mom will shoot.  That was one of the examples that I was talking about.  Oh, see, I was trying to do what they were doing.  Rocky.  Rocky.  They said it multiple times.  Apollo 13.  If it's a descriptive of the title character or mission.  Fargo.  I don't have as much a problem with it.  Jackie Brown.  That's what I just said.  That's the name.  You son of a bitches.  Independence Day.  Well, he did do it like an Independence Day. 
[00:12:30]  He kind of went, this is our.  Here it comes, people.  Exactly.  Independence Day.  Marathon Man didn't do it.  Right.  No.  That's why I love Marathon Man so much.  Do you?  They tried to, but they cut the scene out.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy with Dustin Hoffman was like running.  He was so tired.  And he goes, I feel like I'm running a marathon, man.  Oh, no, he did not.  They cut that out.  Oh, good. 
[00:13:00]  We always seem to start off with movies, don't we?  Yeah.  That's like a movie thing.  I'll tell you.  Can we come in talking about our nights?  Yeah.  And that's what we're doing.  And it's usually spent doing that.  Yesterday.  Oh, my goodness.  Once again, I just watched a gentleman, tough guy named Dalton, take care of a place called  the Double Deuce.  And let me tell you something.  That guy knows how to bounce.  You've been enjoying, uh...  What?  What?  What? 
[00:13:30]  Roadhouse!  Roadhouse.  We've been watching some weird stuff lately.  It's so bad that you have to watch it.  You should have just rented Rockstar or got it on Netflix or something.  You're going to watch a bad movie.  That's the one.  Fucking unbelievably bad, but it's one of those movies, if it's on...  Now, I won't watch it from the middle, but I will watch it from the beginning.  And watch the entire movie.  If you look at the cable guy and you're like, Roadhouse?  Eh, it started 10 minutes ago.  Let me see what's going on with this.  I don't think I'm alright with this movie. 
[00:14:00]  Between this and Canon, you're just going home and watching just the worst thing you  can find.  I fuck it.  That goddamn Me TV channel?  It's fantastic.  They're still making, like, new shows, too.  Do they?  On television.  Yeah.  There are all these channels that have current shows.  Fuck that noise.  I am fucking...  I swear to you, I can only watch decrepit old shit.  You know what you have to watch?  What?  I watched...  I was on DVR. 
[00:14:30]  I watched the first episode of Stars vs. Stripes.  Oh, how was that?  It's a boring show.  Is that Jack Osborne's show?  No.  It was supposed to be?  Yeah, I think it was supposed to be.  But I was watching it, and then, you know, the stars have to go on, like, military missions.  And the point is, for everybody to now get an appreciation of what these military guys  do every day, they get dropped off into, like, a lake, and they have to swim to shore.  Uh-huh.  Two men...  Oh, no.  ...were not able to complete the mission from the beginning, and a rescue boat had to go 
[00:15:00]  out.  What celebrities were they?  All right.  Let's list who's on there.  All right.  Let me see if I can guess who the two that couldn't make it were.  It was...  Hmm.  Hmm.  What are their names?  All right.  Let me go.  Oh, yeah.  Could it have been?  Over all the contestants, it will...  Dean Cain.  He played Superman.  I know who he is.  Yeah.  Sure.  I bet he did okay.  He did fine, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure, sure.  Dolvet Quince.  Am I saying that right?  I think...  Who's Dolvet Quince?  He was a trainer on The Biggest Loser. 
[00:15:30]  An almost drowning victim, apparently.  Okay, yeah.  Boy, Dean Cain's gained some weight, huh?  He had a little bit of weight.  He's not a Superman-looking guy.  Dean Cain.  Yeah.  Dean Erock.  It just doesn't rhyme or sound like his name.  Yeah, he should change his name to Supper Man.  That's actually pretty good.  I know it is.  Who are you fucking telling?  Supper Man.  Eve Torres.  WWE Diva.  Strong swimmer. 
[00:16:00]  Stars, huh?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Layla?  Layla.  Ali?  Okay, cool.  Yeah, yeah.  She did fine.  She did fine.  Oh, good.  Layla Ali.  Muhammad's daughter.  That's right.  She's the daughter of Lonnie and Muhammad.  Troy Kwan, apparently.  Nick Lachey.  Oh, I thought that was our own Troy Kwan.  No, that's Nick Lachey.  Oh, Nick Lachey.  He used to date Vanessa.  He's married to her.  Oh, are they married?  Yeah, she's having his baby.  No, there you go.  She's hot, man. 
[00:16:30]  Picabo Street?  She's a skier.  And she can swim.  Picaboo.  I bought an apartment on Picaboo Street.  Picaboo Street.  Everybody there looks at each other's windows.  Picaboo Street.  All right.  That's a good one.  You're right.  Picaboo Street.  Oh, Travaz.  Travis.  Picaboo Street.  That's where everybody plays hide and seek.  Got it.  Yeah, we got it, Chip.  Terry Crews.  Oh, what's he from?  Well, he was in here.  He's been in studio before.  He's the right guard guy. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  And he was the last guy.  Also, someone that needed to be rescued.  He's not a good student.  No, no, no, yeah.  God, I hate that.  He digs in with his fingernail.  He's the worst.  And Edgar's awful.  That was the other one.  Todd Palin.  Sarah Palin's husband.  Sarah Palin's husband was in this.  Wow.  Terry Crews and the trainer  from Biggest Loser  both  they had to be rescued? 
[00:17:30]  to the point where Jess was like  she actually, this is her quote  and she's the sweetest person  she goes  why do they sink?  why do they sink?  that was her quote  oh no  she's like, what's going on?  this can't be television  they both, like immediately  the helicopter dropped both those guys in the water  and immediately  you saw their POV camera  and it just started getting flooded with water 
[00:18:00]  and they're swimming  they're the most muscular guys on the show  why wouldn't they tell them that beforehand  I can't swim  they still wouldn't say  they were like, you know what  I'm a decent swimmer  but when you get all that equipment on and everything  it gets difficult out there  they were the only two that couldn't make it  in the black community you're a good swimmer  if you start sinking and your arms are still moving  they both needed rescue boats  it is just one of those stereotypes  that just keeps showing how kind of accurate it is 
[00:18:30]  if you're a black guy who can't swim  you just shouldn't ever be in the water on television  it's just bad  it just sets everybody back  General Wesley Clark  he's the host  he's the host  some chick in Wesley Clark  wow, they had to get the chick in there  of course  yeah  and he  they fucking  and what's his name  nice weapons  the sharpshooter who was on the show  who's talking about  Chris Kyle  Chris Kyle  uh huh  oh cool  Eric said Chris Evans in my ear  oh god  Chris Evans is Captain America 
[00:19:00]  he's on the show  as one of the military guys  oh cool  he's I think Dean Cain's  good for him  but yeah  I mean  who's doing well  off the first part of the show  I fell asleep before it was over  oh boy  sounds thrilling  it's not a great show  it's not wrestling  no it's not  but yeah  the black guys couldn't swim at all  yeah  that's a  that's a terrible stereotype  and uh  they just  I don't know  I guess there's no real need for it  in the inner cities  I mean  not many people that they know 
[00:19:30]  maybe with pools  to teach people how to swim  I mean  Travis's own  lovely daughter Riley  she knows how to swim  sure she does  oh  Jesus  Uncle Paul  yeah very good swimmer  only three  wow  because she has access  to uh  the beach  over by your house  and uh  and Uncle Anthony's pool  that's correct  yes  okay is this it  all the point of view cams  yeah  you've seen big muscular  right guard  uh not right guard  whatever  deodorant commercial  Terry Crews right 
[00:20:00]  yeah  he's a big intimidating guy  yeah  who do you think would win  in a swim meet  oh my daughter  your three year old daughter  Riley or Terry Crews  Riley would be laughing  at him  yeah  and if she hangs  around my house  too much  calling him horrid names  gotta watch the language  in front of the wee ones  yep it's taught in the home  it really is  yes  you're not born with it  yeah no  I'm seeing the point of view cams  of all these other people  that have been dropped in  and it's above the water  you see some splashes  but  sure  I mean they're right there 
[00:20:30]  they know how to swim  Dean Cain's like  I can make it  doing a good little  side stroke thing there  you know  and the swimming part  this is not supposed  to be the difficult part  you just start in the water  and then you swim  and you have to shoot  some targets  and blow the thing up  and then the difficult part  they get into a little  zodiac type boat there  and then they're off and running  but your clothes get all wet  yeah  your clothes are wet  it's part of it  that's a difficulty  in the army  your clothes get wet sometimes  they do right  that's one of the things  we would  that would be the worst part  about SEAL training  is sitting there  with your clothes wet 
[00:21:00]  everything I've seen  from SEAL training  it just looked like  you deserve to do  anything you want  in the world  if you've been through that  because it's just  sitting there  where they pour that sand  down the back of your neck  when you've been up  for 48 hours  you're on a freezing  cold beach  and you just gotta sit there  and now they give you  a giant log  that you gotta hold  above your head  or you get smacked  imagine how cranky  you would be  you'd be so irritable  all the time  imagine that guy  oh boy 
[00:21:30]  I'd probably go  come on  stop  I'm making this difficult  you'd think they'd be like  oh alright  that's all  that's all you gotta do  is ask  I'd like a nice  hot shower please  and some sleep time  at least a change of clothes  I'm wet and muddy  what are you saying  the army doesn't have  enough money  to get me some  new fucking  combat boots  Iraq was mad  he thought it was  the navy meals  and he signed up  and was like  what is all this work  I gotta do  I thought it was  the gravy seals  that's even better 
[00:22:00]  chip up  yeah I mean  it's kind of a  direct playoff  with Anthony said  yeah a little bit  yeah  people then type in  here on Palatog  Iraq go to break  no  have you gotten  to the part  where they  what do they cut it out  they don't want the show  to be racist  no it's an hour  like that's where  I fell asleep  like every commercial  like I have to watch  a minute worth of  oh man  and the show's an hour long  and they separate  them into groups  and then you have to  watch every single  group doing the same 
[00:22:30]  mission  oh really  is that it  like 10 minutes  yeah  and when they're  doing the mission  you're not really  seeing the personality  the celebrity  you see somebody  running through  sand or whatever  swinging a sledgehammer  they're just shooting  the same targets  they're trying to make  it have a look  like modern warfare  right  they have that whole  first person perspective  a lot of scenes  I saw where you see  the weapon  like a first person  view  a video game  tracking them  on the beach  they have their names  following them  and shit like that  and they go in 
[00:23:00]  they go into  mission control  where they have  all their plasma  screens and everything  and like the stupid  celebrities were going  like you know  mission control  with all the screens  and everything  it was just  it was really impressive  it's a TV set  you're not in the military  they built it  it's a TV set  yes  ugh  so um  Jack was supposed  to host this  or be a part of it  I think he was supposed  to be part of it  I don't know  who replaced him  and then they tossed him  um  because I guess  they figured his  uh  his  is the guy 
[00:23:30]  and this is the guy  the biggest loser trainer  the whole time  he's sitting there going  I give it always 100%  I push myself  to the next level  I endure physical challenges  and then he couldn't swim  except for water  he was just like  a simple like  oh boy  just chick is a skier  and she's fine  a retired boxer  lay while  everybody was fine  right here's their  um  here's their uh  perspective cams  you gotta just tread water  for a while  that's a lot of  okay  oh  it's probably gonna go 
[00:24:00]  Dolvet is yelling  he's yelling help  he's sinking  oh my god  he's sinking  he's yelling help  and sinking  this is the scene  off of like  fucking Jones Beach  any weekend  during the summer  yeah it is Dolvet  they're laughing  nobody can make a comment  on what's happening  he's literally drowning  get on your path  just float  oh  humiliating  it's so bad  he's sinking  his camera's underwater 
[00:24:30]  completely  he's sunk  and then they go to  commercial  like he died  why would they go to  commercial  while a death  is happening  because they want you  to watch it  exactly  no one thinks he died  we would have heard it  there's a clip from the show  oh boy  oh boy  that's after he was rescued  that's the two of them  after they got rescued  they're congratulating  each other  alright  we won't elaborate on that  it's just ridiculous  because they're like  the biggest guys  on the show  they're the most  in shape muscular dudes 
[00:25:00]  on the program  they really are  oh boy  yeah  and Jess was like  I gotta see that  but she didn't want to  point out the obvious  because she wanted  she always is an optimist  because she's  no  stereotypes are wrong  and da da da  yeah  there he is  okay he's yelling  help again  this is back from commercial  did you let him drown  all the way through commercial  this is screaming help  give me your back 
[00:25:30]  yeah  give me your back  give me your back  help  why is General Wesley  Clark there  because in a fake set  that's  looking all concerned  what do you think  he was thinking  in post  I'm sure they did it in post  it's not real time  how do I look  you can relax bro  yeah it's a TV show  stupid  relax I got you  oh yeah  rewind a little bit  because this is where  he's talking about  being a pretty good swimmer  probably one of the  scariest moments 
[00:26:00]  of my life  but imagine  the men and women  that have to do this  every single day  how about the men and women  celebrities that did it  with no problem  yeah  imagine the people  who have to go swimming  all the time  swimming  imagine the people  that just did this  why is Wesley Clark  in that fucking set  it looks terrible  that's awful  they keep cutting  to General Wesley Clark  in a set  looking at screens  like oh boy  and you know  that he's not  because like the host  the chick who's  actually hosting it  yeah  she tells all the contestants  you're going to be  doing this mission 
[00:26:30]  and General Clark  is going to be back  in mission control  watching  it's done in post  he's not watching  they edit the shit  they put it up  on screens later  he's just walking around  looking at things  but who cares  if he's there  what does he have to do  with this shit  he's a real general  big deal  and great  and I think he probably  makes one of the  reserves go home  at the end  oh yuck  they're probably trying  to make it official  General  what does Wesley Clark  think  he yells  you are  D-O-R  yeah I want your  D-O-R 
[00:27:00]  I want your D-O-R  mayonnaise  catchy like  you know  you've been eliminated  line  oh let's see  it should be  something good  like  you're gay  don't ask  don't tell  you won't be on  this darn  tootin beach  for a long time  that's a good one  that's a good one  it rolls right off the tongue  like you're fired  I bet it's like  you've been dismissed  yeah  you've been dismissed  and then they  they do the  you've been drummed out  music  or maybe you're 
[00:27:30]  discharged  oh  what about  your tour has ended  oh  that's a good one  that's a good one  that's a good one  we're um  oh  it's a no go  Roger Wilco  that's a good one  no go  how funny  he ran for president  and now he's just  watching black celebrities  not swim  here's uh  the actual clip  from uh  the show  when they discharge somebody  oh  that's a little harsh 
[00:28:00]  and the guy goes  uh  yeah  you've been kicked out  I've been kicked out  well  no shit  oh no  oh  oh here it is  you at best  unfuck yourself  or I will  unscrew your head  and check down  your neck  that would be great  imagine the calls  that would come to the switchboard  at network television  Arlie Ermey is watching this show  like  oh  and they didn't give me this gig  I know  how do they not give it to Arlie Ermey  just put him on the side yelling  just put him in that dumb set 
[00:28:30]  that the general's in  yeah  he could be yelling  full metal jacket stuff  oh  it would be great  it's just in there  looking at green screens  that haven't been fucking  no shit's been put on him yet  but they haven't been chroma keyed yet  yeah  it's terrible  but they have to use  nicer language now  would you not look down  on you  you  you  or you  there's no racial  bigotry here  god damn it  well I gotta see that  well we haven't seen  the second black guy 
[00:29:00]  drown yet  who drowned better  first black guy drowning  or the second black guy drowning  well the first guy  was going  help help help  Terry Crews  just sunk like he had rocks  in his pocket  he didn't even say anything  he just got in the water  and he immediately  oh shit  you just started seeing the water  go over his mask  it was just done  oh man  that's bad huh  he's like  whoop  sink in  Jesus  why didn't he swim  I don't know  you know when there's no element  of somebody being killed  like they're running around  yeah they got weapons 
[00:29:30]  they're in some situations  that can get the fear up in you  and stuff  but you're not being shot at  by an enemy  no  there's no chance  of you stepping on a mine  or you know  or missing  or yours even  yes  yours or mine  oh  why didn't you do the  boys what happened there  Jimmy  I forgot to  oh  tell me who your charity  is that you were playing for  here  charity  everybody's gotta play  for charity  charity  how about fucking  teaching inner city 
[00:30:00]  youths how to swim  you motherfucker  and they're just  somehow benefit troops  but I hate how  they have to say  is that Wesley Clark  yeah  oh he looks comfortable  on camera  his fucking  his head  his head is positioned  on his shoulders  like an ape  he has an ape  positioning of his head  he really does  yeah  he doesn't have that  Bill Clinton  natural presidential charisma  and he doesn't know  what to do with his hands  appreciate what you're doing  for veterans here  thanks very much  for your service  you're dismissed  oh  you are dismissed  he uses a military lingo 
[00:30:30]  thanks for service  thank you for your service  thanks for playing this game  you can go home now  and talk to the producers  over there  you've been dismissed  you're flat footed  and you can't swim  congratulations to you Terry  and of course  to the rest of you  I was a seal  on a TV show  I hate her folded up  jacket sleeves  oh and her  Fawcett hairdo  and her fucking long neck  she does have a giraffe neck  she was photographed  in Loch Ness 
[00:31:00]  are not excited  at all  she's got those  gold rings around  I'm not excited  to be in the first one out  you know  honestly  I could have to  find a little thing  for these two to sit on  this is terrible  to help out  men and women  who fight for our country  her blazer  with their sleeves rolled up  really takes everybody  out of the  war zone environment  yeah  what the fuck  her fucking  orange blazer  yes  it's terrible  how about NBC  just gives this money  to troops  instead of wasting it  on production  of this shit show  how about they just  hand it to the troops  you know the amount  of money they spent 
[00:31:30]  on making this show  yeah  they could have just  make a donation  this looks horrible  it's not a great show  I bet it doesn't do well  no  but you know  after they saw  what happened  with him and Terry Cruz  that they were like  we gotta have more  water challenges  oh yeah  we need drowning people  this is what people  will tune into  more drowning  for Jack's sake  for Jack's sake  I hope they cancel  the show  boycotting  yeah  it's not great  sorry we just gave it 
[00:32:00]  a rousing plug  there didn't we  I know we gave it  the shit it deserved  cause it's shit  yeah it looks stupid  Wesley Clark  looks very  his hands are in front  he's holding his hands  and he sounds like Bush  a lot  but his head is  forward on his body  like an ape  he just looks  slight of frame  there's nothing  intimidating about him  he looks slight of frame  his bio picture  even looks uncomfortable  he's wincing in it  he's wincing  my picture  General Wesley Clark  he's the host  I guess he  he's got an 8 year old's 
[00:32:30]  first day of school  haircut  he needs that uniform  and a few years  shaved off  kinda look intimidating  who thinks that  Wesley Clark  is gonna be a big  ratings grabber  like hey listen  we're having a hard time  in prime time  Wesley Clark  Wesley Clark  he's got the it factor  doesn't he  he's a ratings bonanza  yeah  wow  alright  well that's uh  that looks great  but yeah you would have  absolutely gotten  a kick out of it  I should have  watched it  yeah  I um  last night  I didn't watch  much TV last night 
[00:33:00]  I was very busy  uh  programming  my uh  my helicopter stuff  when I get into something  boy do I dive right in  yeah  head first  um  yeah  uh  I  I have a  quadcopter  and I've been  quadcopter  quadcopter  oh I thought it was  just a really handsome  helicopter  oh  oh quadcopter  you know uh  the tricopters  are big this year  it's I was like 
[00:33:30]  crazy to even do  the fucking idiots  guys like quadcopters  so two years ago  dude where you been  tricopters  shut up  what's that the difference  is the difference  that three blades  instead of four blades  the chopper things  yeah  whatever they're called  the chopper things  so um  I got that thing  it's called the  AR drone parrot thing  it's a small little thing  I got this a while ago  it goes  rock I have a peg  leg and a patch  over one eye  and I walk around  and go  our matey  it's a tiny little 
[00:34:00]  uh  remote control  uh  helicopter  and it's got a  camera on it  and you use your  iPad or iPhone  to control it  and fly it around  I've been doing  that for a while  but then I start  going like  ah  I wonder if  there's better  ones out there  and boy  was there ever  so I decided  I was gonna  get this  and I got  one  uh  that's got  uh  quite a few  bells and whistles  on it  this looks like  like  like an obstacle  in Half-Life  yes  something you have  to control  or get past 
[00:34:30]  or not be shot by  it looks like a bed bug  with four fucking  helicopter things on it  giant flying bed bug  it really does  what's the difference  in the flying  between a tricopter  and a quadcopter  other than  there's four  things on it  nothing really  it doesn't make it  it just tries  yes it does  I got you Chip  that was Chip  yeah that was Chip  so I'm like  alright let's see  what this does  and then the more  I research these things 
[00:35:00]  the more I find out  the technology  that's gone on  in the past few years  as far as radio control  um  helicopters and planes  and whatnot  has gone  has been astounding  when we were fired  uh  and off the air  I got into radio control  helicopters  and uh  again dove in  head first  got all the  the newest technology  that was out  as far as gyros go  and autopilots  stabilizers  while your fingernails grew  and you collected  urine and bottles  my own piss  I watched Ice Station  Zebra all night long  uh 
[00:35:30]  it was  and and I was amazed  at the time  what what was going on  technology wise  does it seem primitive  compared to what  there's uh  yes  ten years later  there's nothing  on my old stuff  I could even use  for this new stuff  and uh  the technology  now  there's  there's a GPS  and compass  on it  um  and  tracking  and a ground  control station  program  that now  uh  it uses  google maps  and then overlays 
[00:36:00]  a program on it  where I could just  point and click  anywhere on a map  and the fucking thing  flies there  wow  and has cameras on it  it's got a gopro  hd camera on it  so you can just  fly it around  and and  and look at shit  all over the place  I don't even have to  go out now anymore  I don't have to  now  I literally don't have  to leave my house  I could just take  this thing off  from my living room  fly it around  and look and see  what's going on  in my neighborhood  and how far does it go  uh  it can fly for  uh  thirty minutes  on the big batteries 
[00:36:30]  that I got  and you're like  the distance though  oh it depends  I could do  you know  I could crank the thing  at about 35 miles an hour  for 15 minutes  and then it's got  to come back  wow  but I could go  pretty much  I could go a long way  could you go up to  could you go up  and like watch a plane  taking off  I don't know  if I'm supposed to  do that  I don't think  I should do that  I would try to land  it on the wing  and then look inside  and go hi  yeah  there's a bed bug  on the wing  yeah  it uh  it goes up  um  it could go  one of these things  actually went up 
[00:37:00]  to 16,000 feet  holy shit  but he had some  he had some real  crazy transmitter  receiver shit  going on  how much battery  did that take too  probably a lot of battery  to get up that high  the whole thing  makes airplane pilots  seem obsolete  it's amazing  because here's what happens  I could just put in  waypoints  and be like  eh  I want it to go here  here here and here  and then come home  and it'll do it  all by itself  and then anytime I want  I could take over  and do that  I could set the altitude  and then be like  I want to fly it around  but I want it to stay  at 300 feet 
[00:37:30]  it'll do it  it'll do that  and then if the transmitter  just says fuck you  and I lose control  it knows to just  come home and land  exactly where it took  off from  it'll just land  where it was  where it took off from  and it gives you  all the telemetry  information  speed  altitude  if you're turning  it shows like  it's got  it literally has  the aircraft type  instrumentation  on the display  and you can fly it  just from the screen 
[00:38:00]  it's a live picture  that's transmitted  down to me  during flight  so I could see  exactly where it's  going and fly it  just by the video  screen  there's no delay  no delay  is a video screen  like on your  computer or iPad  it could be my  computer  or I could just  put it up on my  television in my  living room and fly  it with a joystick  so I could get a  joystick  and fly it  via the joystick  like I would  a video game  now what's this guy  he's using some  kind of a handheld  that's your standard 
[00:38:30]  radio control type  two stick controller  but then there's  other channels on it  to control the  camera  you could steer  the camera around  you can  there's so many  cool little options  you could do it  you know how cool  if you go to the  top of the  horizontal bridge  with that or  something  or like look  at that view  yeah  I want to take  it around to  like  peek into places  that you can't  get into  of course  you know  over fences  things like  that  yeah 
[00:39:00]  I think it  would get a  shotgun blast  if you took it  over into a jail  you just have it  land in the yard  covered with  cocaine  and guns  you know what  it's funny you  just said that  but don't think  that people will  not try to  smuggle stuff  into jails  with this quiet  there is no  fucking reason  I couldn't  plot out  a course  where it would  land in the  yard of a prison  with guns  strapped to it  of course 
[00:39:30]  I would never  do that  but what's  stopping somebody  from doing that  it can carry  weight like that  yeah  probably the same  thing that stops  them from throwing  a bag of guns  over the top  over the top  well the thing  is you're there  when you do that  you gotta run away  this you could be  fucking like  three miles away  and have it just  land in the yard  with shit on it  how funny would that  be a guy trying to  throw a bag of guns  over the wall  and running away  falls back down  on his head  loud clanking  it really does  seem very  like this is 
[00:40:00]  cutting edge  brand new  technology  it's really  a lot of this  military technology  that's available  now to civilians  that have the  means and just  even know it  exists  but I think  you're gonna see  maybe some  criminal elements  here using this  stuff for  no good  you can get  cocaine over the  border one  little baggie  at a time  one ten dollar  baggie at a  clip  one baggie  at a time  but what about  what about this  let's say you do  want to deal  some coke or 
[00:40:30]  something  I do  and you just  have like  you put a little  servo on it  that has a little  grippy claw thing  and you can open  and close it  by your remote  control  and you clip  on some coke  and you fly it  to a location  where the people  are  and you drop it  there it's a  little drop for  them  now  now you're  like  I'm not even  there  if there's any  cops  what are they  gonna do  right  yeah  right  right  right  because as  time goes on  it will probably  get stronger  and stronger  like at least  you can carry  you'll be able  to carry 20  pounds  or whatever  yes 
[00:41:00]  very frightening  pretty cool  though  but yeah  the technology  I'm just totally  into the technology  behind this  and it amazes  me  fucking amazes  me  I was doing  that last night  programming it  so what could  yours do ten  years ago  ten years ago  I could  stabilize a  helicopter  by letting go  of the controls  but it was  stabilized by  the contrast  difference  from four  cameras  of the sky  and the ground  so it knew 
[00:41:30]  like if one  side of the  helicopter  these little  cameras  saw too much  darkness  and lightness  on the other  side  it would  stabilize it  out  but it uses  like the  contrast of  the sky  and the  ground  that was  ten years  ago  gyros  and GPS  and  accelerometers  all kinds  of new  technology  that they  just jam  in these  things  it's great  video quality  and the  video quality  is crazy  the GoPro  camera  is  it's an  insane  fucking  1080p  full HD 
[00:42:00]  there's an  abandoned  water park  in Orlando  at Disney  oh would that  be cool  river country  imagine  going like  outside  taking it to  Orlando  and just  going outside  that theme  park  and just  sending it  over  you can  get video  of the  whole  park  I want  to see  what's up  in those  observation  towers  for the  world's fair  thing  you can  if you  want to  right up  there  and take  a peek  inside  do you know  how many  people are  going to be  using this  to catch  cheating  spouses  inside  of  windows  oh shit  yes  just have 
[00:42:30]  it hovering  outside  the window  because  they're not  that loud  remember that  show  cheaters  this is  what  they need  to use  on that  show  the quality  is very  good  it's crazy  video quality  it looks  amazing  and with  the way  it runs  itself  for a lot  of these  things  you could  run the  camera  you could  just have  it  stop  somewhere  and hover  and then  you can  control  the camera  so you  could  pan  and 
[00:43:00]  up and  down  side  to side  wow  it's amazing  I don't like  what this  idiot's doing  with it  he's just  he's got  it 10  feet above  the ground  how much  you go  higher  fuck  you pussy  I don't  want to  lose it  I know  but he's  going so  low  so you  put yours  together  and it  actually  came together  okay  I put it  together  and then  the program  last night  and then  somebody's  like  because I posted  a picture  of what the  program looks  like with the  map and the  instrumentation  and stuff  and somebody  goes  oh you idiot  you put your  coordinates  yeah it's like 
[00:43:30]  that's the screen  and it's like  you put your  latitude and  longitude  coordinates in  there  it's like  no that's  the factory  that it came  from  it's China  you dummy  it's like  put it  put the  coordinates in  then  they thought  I fucked  up  wow that's  amazing  that's the  map that  you'll see  where you  could just  point and  click or  put way  points  and then  on the  left side  the right  side is  the  instrumentation  altitude  altitude  it's air  speed  how  vertical  air  speed  and then  the top 
[00:44:00]  is the  camera  where you'll  actually see  the forward  view of  where the  helicopter  is going  now let me  ask you  if you put  a place  in that  your battery  won't get  you to  like say  you just  hit Hong Kong  from here  would it  say I  can't do  that  you could  have an  option  in there  where it  will fly  out  it'll try  to go  to wherever  you want  it to  but it  knows that  if it  traveled far  enough where  it has to  turn around  at that  moment  and come  back  it'll do  it  automatically  you should  have that  in there  it won't  allow you 
[00:44:30]  if you  click the  option  if not  it'll just  keep flying  straight  there's a lot  of different  options you  can select  but yeah  it knows  it pretty  much knows  how to  save itself  that's amazing  I just wish  these people  doing this  video did  better  now looking  at the  ladies feet  put it in  the air  terrible  fucking  terrible  people  get up  there  there are  some really  cool videos  that people  took up  in mountains  and just  right next  to huge  buildings  and they  just climb  right up  the side  of the  building  let's find  one of  those 
[00:45:00]  what's this  one called  parking lot  follies  this is  horrible  you can  just put  fucking  yeah  I don't  know  cam  x aircraft  rc aircraft  cams  you can fly  it up  next to a  skyscraper  in like  somebody's  office  building  like how  freaked out  would you  be if you  were in  your office  and you  saw this  mini helicopter  floating outside  your window  I bet they  wouldn't like  I bet the  NYPD wouldn't  like it if I  just took it  down the street  and started  like flying  around Manhattan  they would hate  it  what are the rules  about that 
[00:45:30]  I don't know  I bet that's  not very good  rc airplane crash  with on board  camera  college point  new york  oh there  there guys  flying around  look at that  wow  nice and high  he's above  the water  and it looks  like he's  he's flying  around  he's taking  a little turn  there  where is he  college point  so he's  oh that  looks like  a target  store  he's flying  around  that's pretty  high  that's like  500 feet  300 feet  that's pretty  high  yeah  that's about  oh he did  a roll 
[00:46:00]  oh he's  rolling around  is he rolling  or is the  camera  he's rolling  it says  airplane crash  with on board  cameras  I guess  things didn't  go well  skip to the  crash  yes  skip to the  crash  maybe  that's true  it is kind  of nice  you know  it would be  cool though  if they were  strong enough  to hang  on to  oh what  happened  he has no  control at all  the sign says  strong enough  to hang  on to  you can just  fly yourself  around  it's called  a plane  no but I mean  just a personal  craft thing  oh shit  what's happening  oh he's spinning 
[00:46:30]  oh no  this is what it  would look like  to fucking  spin into the  ground  we're watching  footage  oh he goes  right here  of it crashing  where I believe  what happened  spinning out of  control  the battery  fell out  you gotta put  that shit  in tight  oh he's got  no control  at all  oh man  how does his  battery fall out  what a dick  yeah that could  kill somebody  though  the battery  could kill  somebody  you know  what I'm  learning  what  Target stores  have a big  Target on their  roof  who knew that  right  did you not  know that  I didn't know 
[00:47:00]  oh right  that's true  people that make  them  you can only see  it from first  class  the Target  painter  every employee  of the store  Mr. Target  exactly  he's not  crashing very  fast  no  oh that's  where the  guy's standing  he's trying  to get it  back to  I guess  he's trying  to get it  back to  himself  but he's  got no  control  it was  spinning  but now  it seems  like it's  almost flying  fairly decent  the footage  is okay  going in  it's not  maybe it's  gliding  oh maybe  because it's  a plane  not a  helicopter  it's an 
[00:47:30]  aerial plane  oh this is  not the one  you have  no this is  an airplane  looks like  it's getting  closer to the ground  oh boy  very quickly  oh boy  this guy's in  trouble  but it doesn't  look like it's  going that fast  he's got to  wonder like  great if this  smashes someone's  fucking head  yeah do I  not fucking  I'm gonna put  incendiary devices  in mine so I  can just hit a  button and it'll  explode  just don't put  oh it's over the  house  look at this  shit  that's pretty  cool  it's crashing  it's like a  movie  into a tree  wow  into the tree  he got so  lucky  he totally 
[00:48:00]  got lucky  it crashed into  a tree  and now you  see a little  branch in front  of it  it stayed in  the tree  yeah so now  he's gonna  probably find it  21 minutes  14 seconds  later  oh he found  it  wow  I guess  I guess he  must have  he got the  video  or is the  video recorded  oh you know  what it's  probably not  first person  so yeah  I guess they  probably found  it  called the fire  department  I lost my  plane in a  tree  oh man  what an  asshole  get your own  get your own  fucking thing  I had one of 
[00:48:30]  mine  one of the  parrot ones  ironically enough  in a tree  it hit the  tree and  got stuck in  there but the  camera was still  going so I'm  the creep  walking around  my neighborhood  with the  iPad just  looking at it  and like  I'm waving  trying to see  myself in the  camera waving  I'm just walking  around my  neighborhood  they think  you're crazy  oh crazy  person  they think  you're Tony  the iPad  retard  it's Tony  the iPad  retard  just walking  around waving  alright he's  got one  in your bathrobe

[00:51:30]  air traffic rules  and stuff like this  no not up to a certain  height  you will soon though  once there's a certain  you reach a certain  height in an area  like New York City  is completely in  three or four  airports  airspace  so you really  gotta pay attention  to what you're doing  but you can go  at least building heights  and this guy's  right over a bridge  oh look at that  he's by the big thing  he did my idea already  by the world's fair  oh well  I could do it better  I'll go in the globe  you could put it over 
[00:52:00]  Yankee Stadium  during a game  oh why couldn't you do that  what are the rules  with that  with the spectators  or people  you could put it  right on the third base  probably dangerous  probably  just land it  right on the base  not in the stadium  over it  but what if you go  you're still outside  the stadium  but high enough  to look in  to the stadium  but what about  over the stadium  then you rebroadcast it  without the express  written permission  of Major League Baseball  but what if you did  decide to do a  fucking buzz by  the pitcher's mound  if you're a good enough  pilot with it  oh man  you could get it away 
[00:52:30]  yeah you fly it  what are they gonna do  chase it  then you get like  the big unit  kind of throw  where it hits it  and it explodes  like a bird  but that's  that's all the shit  they're gonna have  to face with this  yeah deal with all this  they're gonna have  a rule  hey if the government  wants their  fucking drones  how about the people man  we want our drones man  going over the cyclone  this is pretty cool  that is a great video  of New York  I guarantee you  within a year  they have rules  about where you can go  with these  whatever they call them  home recreation

[00:53:30]  yeah this is some  good aerial footage  but then you realize  like after watching this  it's like alright  I'm done with it  gives a fuck  you really just make  one video  and then you're like  I've seen movies  that do a better job  than this  it's much  much more fun  flying it  this is just toys  for rich people  it's a day of fun  oh I don't know  that's it  what are we  a bunch of birds  I don't think so  I don't think  I'm going that high  I don't see one  naked fucking person  either so  that's what I'm  gonna be gunning for  oh my god  nobody wants to see that

[00:57:30]  this  is the  Opie and Anthony  show  hi folks  folks  no uh  no special music  again  I don't think  Iraq likes me  no he doesn't  want to give you  a nice celebration  something to get  topical with  he doesn't want  to um  I don't think  he wants to  interact with me  like he does  with Opie 
[00:58:00]  no he doesn't  no  like like  it would be like  hey sexy  I never asked  him to do that  that was just  his  oh  well he's  showing a little  independence  did you hear  the after show  yesterday  uh  let me think  yes I did  and by the way  I was gonna  uh  call  you were  or text  or you know  just communicate  with the show  because Roland  said something  and I heard  I heard  75 
[00:58:30]  and then I heard  you go  I don't know  if he's listening  like I had no  idea what he  even asked  or said  that I could  contribute  because I thought  like oh I am  listening  maybe I can  and then I  thought for a second  I'm like  I have no idea  what they're talking  about because I  didn't understand  what Roland even  said  he is difficult  to understand  it's impossible  to understand  that gentleman  but did you hear  the conversation  about what Eric  does in there  instead of listening  to the show  uh farts  a lot  a lot  a lot of farting  and downloading  pictures of girls  in bikinis  downloading pictures  of bikini girls 
[00:59:00]  that's what he was  doing instead of  listening  and I did hear  him say  he just did it  to uh  put a picture  on his computer  yeah  but then uh  Sal called him  out and said  he had seen him  do it  for like 50  girls  yeah  so he's got  quite the catalog  of uh  bikini girls  and then he  rotate them  and then he said  uh  I said what are you  not interested  in what goes on  on the show  and his implication  was that  he is at times  but just some  of the segments  don't appeal to him 
[00:59:30]  well it was a  prime example  yesterday of when  uh we wanted to  play the Hillary  Clinton clip  where she was  trying to sound  like a black  woman  yeah  uh on a speech  a couple of  years back  and Iraq had  no clue what  we were talking  about because he  wasn't listening  to the show  oh I'm sorry  Sam hit the button  Sam you got  one job  hit the button  and uh  a dummy was  just kind of  sitting there  I wasn't here  ah rich  he's fucking  he was on  he was doing  some online  shopping on his  iphone  what was he 
[01:00:00]  buying a tent  for a shirt  no I didn't  mean to go  after Iraq  he's one of  my favorites  I'm sorry  that was me  I'm sorry  you set the  bar low  exactly  who do you  hate if he's  one of your  favorites  he's talking  now  yeah so we  found out  Iraq doesn't  really listen  to the show  a lot  no he downloads  there's most  of the public  you're right  the interns  busted him  for sitting in  there farting  multiple times  during the show  and downloading 
[01:00:30]  pictures of  girls in bikinis  the disgusting  part wasn't  so much  farting  it was the  picture of  how him  and Roland  squat when  they fart  like fucking  gorillas  yeah  they just  fucking  like squat  a little  at the knees  Roland does  the three  point stance  right like  he's ready to  hike a football  yeah  right  and Eric  just crouches  over his chair  and then  sprays his bottom  with air freshener  after  yeah it  really conjured  up just this  disgusting thing  that happens  in the death  chamber over  there and  then the door 
[01:01:00]  being propped  open with a  garbage pail  just a bunch  of shit  there's parties  going on in  there all the time  yeah and the  parties going on  anything but you  know listening to  the show  working I guess  they get bored  in there  yeah  what he's just  drawing a fish  he's drawing a  fish  over the lady's  vagina  on the cover  of the New  York Post  smoking hot  yeah  who is that  a spitzer  hooker  Ashley Dupree  pregnant  oh is that her  no that's a  hooker  that's  you don't know  her  who cares 
[01:01:30]  it's a non-story  it's a non-story  on the front  fucking page  a hooker  from three years  ago is pregnant  and engaged  and it's not  with the fucking  the only thing  that put her  on the news  she was sexy man  she was nice  when she was  at the penthouse  but you never  met this one  yeah  I didn't fuck  it but we  interviewed her  no this is  the hooker  this isn't  the madam  oh you  interviewed the  one hooker  I'm just  asking  it literally  is like trying  to explain  something to  this cup  of coffee  have you met 
[01:02:00]  her  yeah we  interviewed her  no not this  one the madam  what  you're pointing  at her  and I'm shaking  my head  yes  how many  confirmations  do we need  that girl  fucked for money  and I've  interviewed her  well I didn't  know you were  shaking your head  because I was  looking down  at your chin  let me take  out my gum  wow  is that that  nicotine gum  still  of course it is  I quit smoking  seven years ago  no you probably  didn't though  you started  chewing gum  you became addicted  to gum  seven years ago 
[01:02:30]  you are addicted  to that huh  is it good  yeah  I wake up  in the middle  of the night  to have a piece  to chew gum  why don't we  all have a  chew  just men  sitting around  I was going  down on Bobby  once and I  forgot it was  in my mouth  and it fell  out like  right between  her fucking  horrible fucking  snack  holy fuck  but Rich  why don't you  just get rid  of it 
[01:03:00]  you gotta get  off it  it's bad  for you  yeah it  probably isn't  the best thing  I would think  you know a lot  of doctors  like if I  talked to five  out of like  eight doctors  and for real  and I talked  to them  and I said  about the  nicotine gum  I go  what's worse  the nicotine gum  or sticking  your cock  in a hooker's  ass without a  rubber  and everyone  said  why bring up  Norton  during this  and then if you  talked to eight  psychologists  and they said  why do you  think that  just because  Norton 
[01:03:30]  fucks hookers  without a  rubber  your mouth  cancer issue  shouldn't be  addressed  what do you  think they're  fucking  mutually exclusive  things  like as long  as I'm  fucking  without  rubbers  you're not  going to  get mouth  cancer  you don't  get mouth  cancer  from nicotine  oh you  don't  no  what do you  think you  get it  from  what mouth  cancer  from all  the chemicals  and all  the you  know  like nicotine  like nicotine  yeah  you don't  think nicotine  is there  any warning  on that  pack  what are

[01:15:30]  it's unbelievable good  pork rolls  it's like  unbelievable  good  it's unbelievable  it's so funny  it certainly is  yeah  unbelievably  good  yeah  yeah  it's like  round  pork patty  yeah  it's like probably  a little above  scrapple  oh  it sounds terrible  you've had it 
[01:16:00]  how good is it  it's delicious  it's fucking  it is good if you cook it  yeah  I mean like you make it crispy  yeah  fried pork roll  don't turn on me when I'm agreeing with you  melted cheese  no I'm with you on it  it's delicious  I'm with you on it  I don't eat shit meat  I like from the  from the fucking  you know  high on the hog  yeah  I eat high on the hog  you know that's where that came from  I know  you eat high all the time  yes that's true  right  I'm a drunk  no you're not 
[01:16:30]  I think you have it under control  he rolls his eyes  yeah  you're looking good  oh thank you sir  I'm a functioning drunk  true  he isn't under control  like Jeff Conaway did  look  I will admit  that  in Chicago  I may have gotten  a little out of line  a couple of times  but  on the home front  not as bad  as it's been  I mean you know  a couple of years back  I would say  when I was actually 
[01:17:00]  having to leave  the studio  to vomit  yeah  it was kind of  getting a little  it was getting a little shaky  there for a while  I do admit  it does get better  I know like  sometimes like  you know  raping  I cut down  did you  yeah  you cut down on rape  yeah see  you can't equate  drinking  responsibly  with rape  there's no  responsible drinking  they go hand in hand  in your life  once you  cross the fine line  of social to addiction  there's no 
[01:17:30]  responsible drinking  wait wait wait  I like to take  the orange juice cap off  and just pour that  over your head  and put the cap back on  I know  look  I know  in my life  I've gotten  I've gotten  you know  a little irresponsible  with drinking  a few times  that's for sure  but for the most part  aside from a little  loud talking  and  you know  just  questionable purchases  like your house 
[01:18:00]  I don't  I love my house  I don't think  it's  that bad a thing  most addicts  and alcoholics  don't think  because it's called  denial  but what is  what is the bad  now  let's look back  when I was talking  like maybe  a couple years ago  when I was  you know like  I'd be doing a read  and be like  and have to leave  that's bad  that's bad  but now  if I identify that  and said  wow  I can't do that  and now  I don't fucking 
[01:18:30]  pound  booze on a weeknight  and then come in here  hungover  how is that a bad thing  that instead of  like completely  cutting it out  and saying  oh my god  I have to accept  I have a problem  like why can't  I just do that  and kind of  well first of all  it has nothing to do  with the weeknight  or weekend  it's how it affects  you when you do do it  oh okay  so you could be  an alcoholic  and drink once a year  or once a month  okay  I don't agree with that  what do you mean  it's how it affects  what you do  and how it affects 
[01:19:00]  people around you  but everybody drinks  and feels like shit  the next day  so everyone's an alcoholic  they don't  most people don't  honestly most people  just have like a drink  it's mind boggling to me too  they'll have a drink or two  and stop  yeah my wife can have  like one or two wines  and she's fine  like I drink one or two wines  I smoke crack  I give hand jobs  but it doesn't stop  I sell a car  okay  but that's what I will do  like on a weeknight  I'll have wine  or I'll have a few beers  but not to the point  of feeling like shit  the next day  most people don't 
[01:19:30]  most people don't have  to have this discussion  like most people  don't go  well you know  I was vomiting at work  and then I decided  to switch things up  I know  I'm having the discussion  because I think  you can have this discussion  without having to go  into recovery  no here's the thing too  like I don't  I honestly don't see  myself  and a lot of people  of course you don't see  yourself having a problem  but I honestly don't  see a problem  with my life  at this point in my life 
[01:20:00]  especially  doing what I'm doing  I don't see it being  that detrimental  first of all you say  I have a couple  during the week  I have a couple  and then the weekend  okay the week  is the maintenance  it's your maintenance  to hold you off  yeah  oh thank god  Colin's here  to back me up  oh boy  hey Colin Quinn  these motherfuckers  are giving me shit  about my drinking  it's like a fucking  intervention  yeah except we're  not intervention  we're in a studio  fucking start the day 
[01:20:30]  off right Chip  come here Mr. Quinn  hi buddy boy  how are you doing  how are you  what a great guy  hi Colin  we haven't seen  this coming  since he started  oh yeah  Sam is in Opie's chair  oh he loves it  he jumps right in  that chair  when Opie's gone  somebody's gotta do it  he actually  when Opie got up  when did he leave  he did the last show  he just picked up  Voss's bagel  and the thing is  Colin just hurt  himself doing that  that was for a crippled  kid in a waiting room 
[01:21:00]  in the waiting room  there's no waiting room  what is this  oh god  I'm sorry  you are  in the waiting room  it's for a crippled  kid in the waiting room  I'm so happy  your corn muffin  has been ruined  it's ruined  Colin  let me bring you  up to speed here  they were giving me  a little shit  and actually 
[01:21:30]  I was just trying  to discuss the fact  that I think  I can drink  and I don't need  to go into recovery  I'm not coming in here  a couple of years back  I was getting a little  out of control  and coming in here  and you know  feeling very hungover  vomiting  midway through the show  and I realized  alright  can't do that  so I rein it in  and now  I will have a couple  of cocktails  but not to the point  where I feel like shit  the next day  and I can't perform  my duties 
[01:22:00]  so why  does it have to be  all or nothing  no no no  well for you it does  here's the thing  you talk about  well I used to be  at work  it's not about work  everything  your whole  your whole life  your whole spectrum  of how you're drinking  on the weekend  on the weekend  do you have  just a couple  on the weekend  I see the show  by the way  I see the show  what  counselor  dunderhead  with your problem  and the whole show 
[01:22:30]  is about him  trying to analyze it  and just that new  soft volume  to his voice  oh yes  it's so annoying  you don't like it  raise your volume  let me tell you  about this  show business  let me tell you  about this  let me tell you  about this  douche bag  and it hit me  he calls me  last night  unfortunately  it wasn't a car  it certainly  wasn't an idea  he calls me  last night  what time 
[01:23:00]  are you going in  like it's a  fucking class trip  this overzealous  hey what are you  wearing tomorrow  he's so excited  what time  are you going to go  can you pick me up  he's on his way  shut up  can you pick me up  hey  hey are you ready  you want to raise  some sketches together  don't fuck yourself  Colin lives seven blocks  here  and he called  Voss in South Jersey  for a living  I love how  the Colin came in  I didn't know  you were excited  last night 
[01:23:30]  I rolled and told me  all about it  on the walking  down the hall  oh it's a fair  you went to a fair  in Jersey  and had oysters  no had clams  on a ham shell  it was great  they were  eight dollars  a dozen  and five dollars  for half a dozen  I worked out a deal  with a guy  I bought a half  a dozen first  for five  I said if I come back  do I get the other  half for three  who works out  a fucking deal  at a fair  you're in show business  and you're working  out a deal  for fucking clams  I had extra tickets  for rides  I resold them  to someone online  you really 
[01:24:00]  bust those stereotypes  gonna go home  with all the  fucking tickets  yes  no why  I gave somebody  a good deal  how much did you  get for the  leftover tickets  twenty dollars  twenty and it  cost me twenty five  that's pretty good  and I gave her  an extra five tickets  so she got an extra  five tickets  plus five off  and she was a poor  lady I could tell  how could you tell  because she was  bargaining with Voss  exactly  I can't understand that  is a woman of color 
[01:24:30]  is that what you're saying  that's exactly  I didn't say that  yeah  I didn't say that  Voss instantly  thinks she's poor  that's good  well look  she's bargaining  with Voss  at a shitty fair  in New Jersey  and then she's rich  it's like it's  fucking Bangladesh  there was a girl  a girl working  a ride  she was working  a ride  she had to be  twenty one  mmhmm  she had a teardrop  on her eye  I'm going  you've already  killed somebody  at twenty one  it's one of those  gang tats  well it's a gang 
[01:25:00]  or she killed somebody  yeah that's  well the gang tats  what else would that be  if it wasn't a gang  if you're not in a gang  and you kill someone  you don't go  can I have that  you know  I wanted to let everybody  know  maybe it was a raindrop  no maybe it was a clown  sometimes  no sometimes  if you  this  if you have a teardrop  it's because you kill someone  sometimes you have a teardrop  as just a gang  oh really  a gang sign  I thought you needed it  in a gang  I thought  you killed somebody  and you were in a gang  I thought it was like  hand in hand 
[01:25:30]  no  no  well I don't  if we can turn the volume  over these two look like  two dumb Yemeni cousins  and they divorced  Yemeni cousins  why are you guys  talking about the issues  of the day  what's going on  ah yes  yes  oh  hooker  in trouble  she's pregnant  there's nothing  going on with that hooker  oh  front page news  it's nothing  who drew a vagina 
[01:26:00]  on this girl  no it's a fish  a fish  rich did of course  56  on her pussy  imagine sitting  sitting at this asshole  during class  trying to fucking study  when you're like  nine years old  he's drawing pussies  you're nine years old  he's 15  yeah  still asking you  why don't we  you know  we can go back and forth  all day long  I'll probably win  but  why don't we just  talk some really  some issues  because we can't hear you 
[01:26:30]  because of the volume  so here's the difference  between you and I  you have to yell  to think  to get people  to listen  and I  I told you  you know  here's the thing  I draw them in  I draw them in  with my voice  I'm doing a podcast  every week  so I know  yeah  you draw them in  with your voice  and you chase them out  with your material  on the clodcast  if it wasn't the clodcast  if it wasn't the body  you would be like  jalapeno on a stick  one of Jeff Dunham's  oldest fucking puppets

[01:50:30]  well we  oh did I cut you off  no no not at all  Joe Biden  Joe Biden by the way  looks just like Walter  I hate to keep bringing up  Jeff Dunham  but he looks exactly like  Walter the uh  the puppet  Jeff Dunham's puppet  he really does  yeah the old puppet  and uh  same brows  yeah  Biden is uh  I think he's uh  I think he's a liability  to the ticket  but they can't get rid of him  now though  no they can't  what are you talking about  I think  he's gonna bow  they're gonna make him bow  no  yeah  no  how fucking close  are they gonna get 
[01:51:00]  can we stop by saying  it's called bow out  stupid  what you did  seven years ago  exactly  that was my  no that'll be  that'll be  get drummed out  okay  alright  alright  holy shit  oh man  oh boy  that was like  that was like a  body shot  that knocked me fast  how could you feel that  yeah 
[01:51:30]  yeah Biden  Biden was um  first of all  he got the state  he was in wrong  right  he was supposed to be  he was in Virginia  he said North Carolina  it was Obama  no that was Biden  that was Biden  Biden did that  just recently  oh I'm sorry  yeah  and then he said  um  he was trying to talk  about Wall Street  and saying that um  Romney is giving uh  we're gonna give Wall Street  uh  uh  take their chains off  and then he said  and they're gonna  punch chain  and they're gonna  put y'all back  in chains  and he said it  like he fucking  was living in Alabama 
[01:52:00]  do you hear that  I can taste hot sauce  when he said it  yes  yes  and it  oh you heard it  it was absolutely  uh  trying to be divisive  uh  trying to use race  to  to scare  to scare  all black people  let me scare you  the Republicans  ah  and the worst part  was  using the black voice  black sense  yes  what up Virginia  what it is  is he's really  talking down  like  they're not  like black people 
[01:52:30]  aren't smart enough  to see through  that fucking  scare tactic  you know  oh hey  gotta leave here  and go tell the Jews  they'll be back in ovens  if those guys are voted in  it pretty much  is the same thing  as saying like  yeah yeah  that the holocaust  will happen again  for the Jews  uh  yeah cause boy  that chain thing  yeah  wow  I can't help it  when I get excited  the facts  the farts point  Jim's farting  like crazy  Biden's just  an old dude  man  that's all it is  he's an old dude  he's an old dummy  an old honest guy 
[01:53:00]  that's how Democrats  stick over  it's the vice president  who cares  who cares  cause if  Quail was dumb  you want your vice president  dumb  you don't want to do  that's like an opener  you don't want somebody  who's going to kill  yes you do  yes you do  put some people  you're preaching to the choir  right next to you  first of all  first of all  you do watch somebody  yes you do  like he has openers  that's what he means  he kills as an opener  you're middling  Maguire's this weekend  huh  you're middling 
[01:53:30]  this weekend aren't you  really the middle joke  that's what you fall back to  is that really  really a middle weekly  is that what I'm on  stop  rewrite  regroup  and let us talk politics  okay  oh no  oh boy  that was like a little roll  right  yeah it really was  wow  it really was  except no voice  is going to ruin it  by saying something  something really stupid  okay  here's your chance to shine  say something poignant  go  what I'm saying is 
[01:54:00]  democrats  like when  whenever somebody  a democrat  says something  atrocious  racist  or whatever  and it came from him  right there  ah he's old  but if  no one cares about  no yeah  they would care  but they would care  if a republican  said that  they'd be screaming  and yelling  at the top  of the wall  yes there's a double  stand here  here's the thing boss  name  though  joe biden's been  the vice president  for four years  tell me something  he's done  three  huh  tell me something  he's done  no one cares  what he does  I'm not offended 
[01:54:30]  I'm black  we know that  I wasn't offended by it  we didn't want  the listeners to know it  old people on a subway  say worse things to me  well because you're  rifling through their  pocketbook  that's true  they say things like  sir stop raping my wife  I didn't know y'all  was together  okay so what  what okay  what's the line  the age line  where you're allowed  to say racist things 
[01:55:00]  and offensive things  what's the line  in this room five  you said it was like  it was so racist  it wasn't so racist  it wasn't  it wasn't so racist  but here's what it was  it was a tactic  it was a calculated  tactic  to scare people  away from Republicans  based on  the use of  slavery  slavery  and the imagery  of black people in chains  that was absolutely  what he did  and when Obama  tried to cover for him 
[01:55:30]  he was bullshitting  saying that it was  some kind of  you know  it was an idea  that he was saying  it wasn't literal  Joe Biden  just wants to be  a black reverend  or something  he sounded like  a reverend at church  a black reverend  he was trying  they're going to come  for you  and then he had  a Martin Luther King fan  right  I wish he'd stand  on a balcony  oh jeez  wow  do you know  there is something  to be said  for when the vice president  says dumb shit 
[01:56:00]  it kind of takes  the focus  off the president  it seems like  a lot of them  make  like Cheney  had a lot of these  things  at opportune times  that would pop up  fucking quail  did it  yes  Gore didn't really  do it as much  but there's always  this thing  with the vice president  where they seem  to take the focus  off the president  he's the  yeah the fall guy  yeah he's the one  that will do  stupid things  yeah  oh my god  when is  vice president  rich boss  boy would you  be an asset  to the ticket  yeah  or an asshole  a fucking asshole  holy shit 
[01:56:30]  jib calm down  my god  I had to go  when I said it twice  oh I love these  really republicans  never use shitty  tactics  come on  yes they do  that's what I'm saying  they both do it  but don't try to  no but what you're saying  what you're saying  is that the media  tends to cover more  exactly  I mean that's obvious  it's very obvious  and this  this is  it's one of the  more filthy  campaigns  on both sides  oh yeah it's going to get dirty  and it's  and for how much 
[01:57:00]  we're supposedly  working this race thing out  because we have a black president  and you know  there's a lot more black people  on commercials now  thank you Jesus  they're not just playing  the criminals  in uh  in alarm company commercials  uh  it's  it's uh  I don't think I've ever seen  the country as divided  racially as it is now  I think it's very divided  I don't think so  you don't think so  I think black and white people  still going to work together  like they always did  I think the media  is playing it like that  but yeah  people going about their business 
[01:57:30]  the same way they always did  yeah you don't think  there's like  what do you think it is then  have you been in his apartment  of course he doesn't think that  you know  nice right  I think  they're trying to divide  it's not only  it's all  uh  forget  why would I be this  here's the problem  when Voss  stops and we're listening  I'm so excited  yes  yes  that's when he said  oh forget it  I was so devastated  it's like  it really is  it's like you see the UPS guy 
[01:58:00]  walking up the steps  of the present  I'm the one who brought up  this whole fucking subject  exactly  you don't know how  you know what it is  you're so used to being  on the defensive  when people actually  give you the floor  you crumble  you fall apart  no I don't  no I don't  you just stopped  and you thought  no one interrupted you  because you had something  to say  but you did  you stopped  it's not only  racial division  Republicans  Democrats  the whole thing  is just  to divide 
[01:58:30]  and not see  what really  is going on  they're all in bed  together anyhow  when it comes to  business corporations  kickbacks  lobbyists  so it doesn't really  fucking matter  right or left  it doesn't really  but they want you  to they want you  to fight  they want you  to take a side  pro-life  pro-joice  it's all bullshit  that's great  that's fucking  Harvey Kite  that's fucking  Yafit Koto's  speech from  Blue Collar  they pit the old  against the young  and the lifers  against the new  bloods  the rich  against the poor  it's not  it's not 
[01:59:00]  racial  but I think  everybody's like  a victim of  doing the same  thing Joe Biden  did  he was in  the middle  of a crowd  more than  half were black  people  so he got a  little black  scent on him  just like when  you go to  cleaners  you start speaking  a little more  Chinese  and everybody  does it  I don't fault  Biden as much  because I don't  care that he did  it is  but the way  it's handled  if it was  a Republican  the media  would be killing  I don't think  Biden's a racist  I think he just 
[01:59:30]  said something  stupid at the  moment  it's not racist  I never said  it was  but the media  would be using  it  Colin's face  is a  it's a  scare tactic  is it because  he left the  last T  off tactic  it's because  we said  scare tactic  seven times  even  Voss was  past that  point  it's really  not about  that  it's about  this  and then  we were  back on the  subject of  the media  and he went  back to  it's a  scare  tactic  I want to  get back  into scare  tactics  so I just 
[02:00:00]  I am not  it's nothing  personal  when you  started saying  that I  felt like  throwing up  a little  well you  know I  I see what  Rich is trying  to say  it's just  all  it's all  bullshit  they both  do the same  things  but it's the  way it's  covered  the way it's  handled  and in that  you do get  an effect  from it  so it is  unfair  and one side 
[02:00:30]  does get an  advantage over  this mud  slinging  campaign  and it is  the left  the democrats  do get  more of a  boost  because it's  covered  more directly  by the  media  although Fox  and Drudge  who are both  really big  sources of  news  Drudge is a  huge one  on the web  trying to take  a more  conservative  slant  which balances  it out  but it doesn't  balance it out  when you look at  all the network  news  broadcasts  MSNBC  all these 
[02:01:00]  big conglomerates  that have  these news  outlets  they're all  heavy liberal  but I'll be  honest  almost nobody  watches  CNN is taking  a fucking  beating  MSNBC  has nine  viewers  Fox has  more than  most of  them combined  and I'm  for whatever  reason  the one  major  conservative  one  network  news  is still  huge  and local  network  news  that'll be  all network  news  here's the  thing  what was I  going to say  he just  can't say  anything  I'm trying  I'm not 
[02:01:30]  going to say  it's your  fault  but it  seems  whatever  you say  it can  get just  jumped on  yeah it's  alright  it doesn't  matter to  me  I know  in my  gut  what was I  going to  say  we all  get quiet  give a  bar  and he  falls on  it was  very important  stop  but when  Biden said  and did  what he  did  in a  speech  I didn't  look at  it and  say  hey look  at this  Democrat  I said  look at  this old  dude  doing old  dude  stuff  yeah but  that's  exactly how 
[02:02:00]  the media  looks at  it too  and it's  like  it's just  an old  dude  it's just  the vice  president  I've seen  what's his  name  from  Utah  Orrin  Hatch  Orrin  Hatch  he came  to the  Martin Luther  King  dinner  said some  of the  most  boring  awful  things  at the  court  dinner  everybody  clapped  and ate  but  nobody  I'm just  like  he's just  an old  dude  no no  but here's  what I'm  saying  the way  the media  portrays  things like  that  if that  had been  let's  say a  Republican  they would 
[02:02:30]  have  said  I think  this  shows  this is  endemic  of what  the Republicans  think  because that's  the track  record  that's what  they're going  off of  it's been a  long time  since Lincoln  so yeah  when I  argue  Bonnie who's  very liberal  our producer  on our movies  anytime you  don't agree  with a  platform  of a liberal  you're a  right wing  fucking lunatic  if you don't 
[02:03:00]  agree with  one thing  oh he's a  right wing  go fuck  yourself  you know  you have  some  conservative  views  some  liberal  views  that's  true  and  they  just  if you  don't  agree  with  everything  and  they're  meaner  people  our  producer  listen  our  producer  you can't  be more  of a  fucking  tree  hugging  liberal  than this  one  he's  got to  bring up  a producer  I don't  want to say  names  it could be  anybody  I'm just  saying  he's  got to  bring  it up  the fact  that  you're  involved 
[02:03:30]  in  something  he's  also a  man of  great  decorum  you're a  little  fucking  professional  go on  and after  you're  saying that  he wants  to say  what do  you mean  I don't  decorate  so I  like the  fact he's  also  bringing up  the topical  phrase  tree hugger  he used  at the  no nukes  concert  against  jackson  brown  in  1979  how much  time  did you  do  there  go 
[02:04:00]  on  with  this  horrible  story  I  can  give  you  a  thousand  examples  how  about  just  one  short  one  he's  got  the  wide  lens  we  were  shot  that  made  my  fucking  teeth  itch  talking  about  there's  a guy  came in  with a  camera  and he's  trying to  take a  picture  of all  four  of us  holy  shit

[02:20:00]  of a big admission  you felt guilty  you were thinking  about golf  and that's your  thing  that's your idea  of fucking  really letting it  out  and the worst  point was that  was his idea  of a big out  yeah  I was gonna come  and I kept  thinking of VJ  Singh  back after this  shut up  so was Bonnie  she was probably  thinking of Tiger  all right  we'll take

[02:21:30]  I didn't know  we were going to  talk about this  on the air  see  Colin  I was just  spreading third  end information  that I heard  was he touching  kids or was he  just trading  tapes  I believe he was  trading tapes  wow  what the fuck  is wrong with that  I believe  it wasn't even  that bad  I heard it was  just streaming  on Netflix  nothing for that  you know what  happened  Netflix streaming  on child porn  is not funny  to anyone in the  that would be  hilarious  well you shouldn't  make fun of

[02:23:30]  and the cop  gets out of  the passenger  side  and he has  the flashlight  he shines  on me  and he goes  16  and I went  no I swear  she's 18  I swear  I said that  he starts  fucking laughing  and the other  guy goes  Anthony  they fucking  know me  of course  all the  Nassau guys  I love  Nassau County  police department  what were they  doing there  he goes  oh we're  looking for  number 16  in the house  there's an  alarm going off  or something  down the street

[03:11:00]  like it's fucking  gone with the wind  I know  I know  he literally  pulled the fucking  emergency brake  I wanna see it tomorrow  has anyone seen the movie  that no one's been  talking about  no one  only the commercials  it just came out  an hour ago  the born legacy  first of all  it's been out for a few weeks  and second of all  it's gonna be as interesting  as a fucking story  about a best friend  top of the car  I haven't seen  Batman either  my best friend  well that's a different story  you're acting  born legacy  is like Batman  no I said  I haven't seen  either one of them 
[03:11:30]  no I understand that  so why don't you pick  the one that everyone  kind of saw  because he was in high school  and the original series  was on  wait that's actually accurate  I meant that as a slam  but I was just  stating a fact there  you're not a fan  of the Batman movies  oh yeah I saw them all  oh okay  I'm not a fan  of that other shit  like the  the  diction  we have learning  oh these dicks  gotta be in it

[03:12:30]  don't you think  you probably should have  seen them just to be up  on the pop culture  of it  and know like  what people are talking  about  that conversation  always breaks  out in a Mensa meeting  I'm sorry  sorry  look at that  I can do it  without my  let's move  oh my god  you've been doing it  without your brain moving  does a brain move  when you think  not that one  I want to ask  one question 
[03:13:00]  why don't you admit  to all of us now  that that's the first  and hopefully last time  you'll use the word  Mensa in your life  that was the first  I've ever said  you only said it  because I said it  that's right  I was fucking mimicking  you've never said it  before you even talked about it  yes I have  because a lot of my friends  are in fucking Mensa  the 140 club  you're like Jay Z  the 140 club  you didn't know  what it meant though  before  are you kidding me  no  no  I didn't know  what Mensa meant  exactly  are you out of your

[03:14:00]  don't fucking lie  why wouldn't we  have a third party  because you guys  will fuck him  that's why  don't go 40  yeah  just for a joke  instead of fucking  showing me the results  we take five points  you know what  you can want to do  why don't you do this  why don't you do this  radio filler guy  get me  Bobby  Colin  and we'll all three  do an IQ test  a real one  okay  any fucking day  and I'll bring in  good glasses  you know why 
[03:14:30]  you don't want to do that  because you're playing  you're playing with  house money  like there's no  pressure on you to win  if you pull a two  it's expected  you're playing with  house money  house money  yeah  do it  fucking do it  and put up some money  you know what  dude  I'm not gonna come in  and be that guy  dude  go fuck yourself  with your  shmami IQ  dude  shmami  you know what  I fucking  I think it was  last Thursday  or Thursday before

[03:15:30]  you're right  he is  I need a favor from him  he's like  I need a favor  you're turning into  the old magnanimous  Jew comic guy  yeah  that's just like  you know what  hey everybody  everybody did such  a good job  yes  see I'm doing it again  hold on hold on  Mr. Rizzo's on the  fucking mic now  I can't  go ahead  why don't you  turn around  before you do  your impression  and fix your hair  you fucking  go ahead  hold on  maybe we'll turn around  and walk out the door  okay

[03:16:30]  I've done for a while  and I walked up  stage and the set  went really good  and I was all like  happy with myself  really and just like  trashed me  for doing shit  that I'd done for years  just when you expect  voice to be nice  it just fucking  brutalizes you  and then for no reason  he's nice  he just stops  and praises  DeRosa  so Joel  will go  hey man  thanks for saying  that good stuff  about me  with his dumb  frilly accent  you can't say  nice things  about your friends  I say nice things  about  who gives a shit  we're not saying that

[03:40:30]  uh  he was talked  to  uh  by who  by me  but it hasn't  worked  and then we  sent him home  oh god  and uh  then I talked  to other people  who needed to  be talked to  who  people who  management  no  people who  deal with  the internship  stuff  and  and it was  just like  they were just  like he's got  a week left  who cares  is that what  they said  well they didn't  say that  but it came to  the conclusion  that you know  we got a week  left just let  him run out  and he's not  going to get  a good review  anyway so who  cares  are you in  charge of the  reviews  yeah  oh boy  so you're 
[03:41:00]  not going to  give me  you're not  gonna  will you read  the review  to him  maybe  is tomorrow  his last  day  I was thinking  about maybe  if we could  do it on the  I have to  check though  oh that's not  a bad idea  you know what  I'm saying  yeah  John Caparulo  just sat down  what's up buddy  hey how are you  you're headlining  Caroline's this  weekend right  I am  I am  is this  how often  you get to  the states  I know  you're like  one of  Chelsea Handler's  regulars  yeah  yeah  yeah  so are you  more of a  west coast  guy  well I mean 
[03:41:30]  I travel all  over but  I'm slowly  inching my way  into like  past the  midwest  so yeah  are you  from California  no I'm  from Ohio  originally  okay  but I lived  in LA  for like  12 years  have you  had a lot  of experience  with the  New York  comics  I know  it's just  a different  world  like between  you know  there's the  midwest  comedy scene  there's the  west coast  comedy scene  yeah  and then there's  the east coast  comedy scene  there really  isn't a  midwest  comedy scene  it's just 
[03:42:00]  you  and then you  left  it's there  I mean  there are  clubs there  but  it is  different  I think  you know  the west  coast comedy  scene  there's  fewer  clubs  yeah  but you  know  I guess  the comics  who you  know  end up  getting  regular spots  since there's  so few  spots  you know  end up being  some really  really  you know  strong comics  but then I guess  you have a lot  more really good  comics in  in New York  because there's  so much more  stage time 
[03:42:30]  and I just  when I was  leaving Ohio  I was like  I'd rather be  broke and warm  so I decided  to go to Los Angeles  instead  how'd you get  hooked up  with the  Chelsea Handler  crew  you know  what  it was  just  Chelsea  and I  just kind  of knew  each other  from  we used  to do  they used  to do  these  all girls  shows  at the  comedy  store  in the  room  upstairs  and  she was  she was  one of  the  she was  like  you know  one of  the funny  ones  in that  show  which  there  weren't  that  many  and  they 
[03:43:00]  used  to  force  them  to put  me  on  as  like  the  one  like  I used  to work  the door  for now  I've been  doing  comedy  15  years  but  when I  first  got out  there  I was  a doorman  at the  comedy  store  so  the club  management  would force  the woman  show  to give  me  like  six  minutes  so  I  just  kind  of  knew  her  from  then  and  when  she  started  putting  together  their  show  she  asked  me  to  come  audition  are  you  guys  nicer  to  each 
[03:43:30]  other  out  there  in  the  west  because  the  east  coast  comics  are  just  a  brutalization  of each  other  like  we had  in here  today  we had  Jim Norton  who's a hero  every day  and then  Rich Voss  Colin Quinn  and Sherrod  Small  it was  literally  I don't know  it might have  been three  two and a half  hours  of just  you couldn't  say one word  without being  dismantled  and destroyed  just hate  yeah just hate  you're a hatred  you know what  I think  I think it's  probably  a lot more 
[03:44:00]  I guess  passive aggressive  in LA  like  there's not  as much  you know  of that  banter  people just  kind of  hold it in  and then wait  for that guy  to leave the room  because in LA  they really mean it  yeah  they really do  they really do  hate you  and wish you  didn't have a show  and so when  you're a guy  coming from the  midwest  and you end up  getting some  success out there  in LA  are you looking  around at the  guys who've  been in LA  for a while  like giving you  cock eyes  and stuff  you know  it's 
[03:44:30]  for the most  part  like I never  got too  much  too much  resentment  my way  because like  I think  you know  I've  done it  as honest  as I think  you can do  it  I mean  I've  you know  it's like  I've never  gotten anything  that you know  people didn't see  me work my ass  off for  so I think  you know  and plus  like you know  I'm just  you know  my act  is  I've never  been one  to you know  I don't  borrow  material  I don't  you know  I'm 
[03:45:00]  you know  I'm pretty  much  who I am  off stage  on stage  have you  encountered  people  borrowing  as you said  your material  ever  have you  ever been  like wait  a minute  you know  I've  here and  there  like I've  encountered  you know  the one  that bothers  me the most  is I've  encountered  Coca-Cola  using my  joke  about Coca-Cola  for one of  their ads  really  that sucked  that was  I was really  pissed  where'd you  use the joke  just on stage  or on TV  I have a joke  like it's in my 
[03:45:30]  it was on my  first special  and like  at the time  I did it on  I had done it  on like  the Tonight  Show  and on  like a  blue collar  comedy special  like you know  it was basically  like it was  about Coke  and Pepsi  like you know  if you order  a Coke  and the waitress  says is Pepsi  okay  and I say  I say  is Canadian  money okay  right  and so  it's  I was  I remember  I heard  a radio ad  I was in  like a Burger King 
[03:46:00]  in Atlantic City  and I hear a radio ad  for Coke Zero  where it's just  a waitress  taking a guy's order  and he's like  can I have a  refreshing Coke Zero  and she's like  well would Pepsi  be okay  and he's like  would Japanese  yen be okay  I'm like  you douchebags  just changed  Canadian money  to yen  and they couldn't  even give you  a little voice  over work  for it  just throw you  something  I would have  done it for free  or just for a  couple 12 packs  I seriously  would have  but they  yeah I don't  know  it just  but yeah 
[03:46:30]  that one  drove me nuts  yeah  you can see  John at  Caroline's  all weekend  carolines.com  Jeff in  Columbus  welcome to the  show  hey Sam  love the show  buddy  hey I got  a question  for you  actually two  one did you  watch Impact  Wrestling last  night  no  and well  okay  you're gonna  have a great  treat  Brooke Hogan  basically  was introducing  a new  referee  a special  referee  she's standing  up straight  and she falls  on her ass  Brooke Hogan  fell down  on TV  last night  yeah  it was just  ridiculous 
[03:47:00]  dude  she  did she  have a  hat twirl  thing  like  oh I'm so stupid  I just fell  on my ass  and whoops  just does the  hat twirl  like  if anybody  can handle  being in a  wrestling ring  on television  that's live  shouldn't it  be Hulk Hogan's  daughter  shouldn't  some of that  red and yellow  gracefulness  have been passed  down  she's just  the biggest  joke buddy  that's hilarious  thank you Jeff  yeah bye bye  alright later  I only caught  the end of the  show where  Brooke Hogan  fell down  yeah so  Hulk Hogan's 
[03:47:30]  daughter Brooke  is I guess  doing stuff  with Impact  Wrestling  which is the  wrestling league  that's not  WWE  there's so many  wrestling leagues  well she went  on TV  and fell down  in the middle  of the room  she's just  introducing  somebody  she's not even  wrestling  she just  is introducing  somebody  and falls  down on her  ass  is this it  Eric  yeah this is  it  oh my god  she's just  standing there  oh how  embarrassing 
[03:48:00]  let me see  that again  yeah that was  how embarrassing  she really  had that moment  where she was  just gonna  try to play  it off  you guys  fight  I hope  you're ready  everybody  please welcome  the beautiful  Terrence Harrell  she can't just  all she had to  do was stand  there  you know  you have the  easiest job in  the world  yeah  say their name  and then look  at them  just talk  into this  stand there 
[03:48:30]  and be Hulk  Hogan's daughter  and then she  falls on her  ass  maybe I mean  I guess a woman  of that size  probably isn't  cut out for heels  though  I guess  maybe that's  I mean if  if  really  no because  you know what  other women  walk in heels  every day  yeah  don't even  cut her that  much slack  listen if you  want to be 6'1  do it yourself  but learn how to  walk in heels  let me go to  this one too  Bill in Philly  hey Sam  yeah  which fall was 
[03:49:00]  worth  Brooke  or the  Shockmaster  Shockmaster  are you a  wrestling fan  John  no I was  you know  back when  everybody else  was in the  mid 80s  sure  and then  I had another  brief stint  in the late 90s  when Goldberg  was hot  for sure  and then  yeah it went  away  Eric can you  show John  the Shockmaster  can you come  back in here  send somebody  in here real  quick  you gotta see  this  this is the  Shockmaster  it's the  greatest  it's not only  the greatest  fall in wrestling 
[03:49:30]  it's just the  greatest fall  that's ever been  on TV  so this guy  we've talked  about on the  show a bunch  of times  but the  Shockmaster  was supposed  to be this  big wrestler  right  yeah  and he's  making his  big first  TV appearance  and he's  supposed to be  this big  intimidating guy  right  he was one of  their mystery  opponent guys  right  yeah  and he's like  and this is  supposed to be  his holy shit  the Shockmaster  is here  I mean  they named him  the Shockmaster  for god's sakes  and this is  how he made  his first  appearance  let me skim 
[03:50:00]  through it  yeah you gotta  fast forward  a little bit  when is this  cause I mean  is this recent  no this was  like 93  oh okay  yeah yeah  yeah  okay is this  it Eric  I think this  is it  they're just  yelling  what are they  yelling about  just get to 
[03:50:30]  what it is  wait for it  that's a  bedazzled  glittered  stormtrooper  element  and he just  fell on his  face  and from 
[03:51:00]  that point  I mean  the guy's  career just  ended after  that  yeah one  more time  all I have  to say  is our  partner is  going to  shock the  world  because he  is none  other than  the shock  left owner  alright  oh right on  his face  that right  there  that's the  yes what  they're yelling  about though  but aren't  they always  yelling  so you  do watch 
[03:51:30]  very actively  yeah  so I mean  that's  you know  they gotta yell  usually it's a  little more  directed at  something  it just sounded  like loud  noises happening  until this  and this guy  this was a big  moment in his  career  like he's like  finally I'm  gonna get that  big break  and he just  falls on his  face  but I think  I'm just more  entertained by  you think  of all times  now  there's bad  acting  and wrestling  it's like 
[03:52:00]  okay wait  now this  is ridiculous  it's like  well  listen  you know  wrestling  right  we usually  take it  very seriously  it's a sport  look how crazy  this is  that's  it's nuts  it's  I mean  it's anything  it's definitely  a sport  if you're wearing  tights and a mask  of course  stormtrooper helmets  they don't allow  anywhere else  what else is up  Bill  so Sambo  Troy told me  to call in  today to ask  if I could  win one of  his vases  oh  where's Troy  at  bring Troy 
[03:52:30]  in here  Troy is  going to be  at the  Man Music  Center this  weekend on  Saturday night  that's right  that's right  he's a DJ  he works for  the channel  here  and he's  moving  and so  we've been  giving like  he doesn't  want to move  all his  stuff  so he's  been slowly  just bringing  his old  stuff in  here  to kind  of give  it away  to the  listeners  and  we started  with autographed  books and  stuff like that  which was  pretty cool  but like  last week  he gave away  his cutlery  and then  he found  a bunch  he had his  ex-girlfriend's  dead mother's 
[03:53:00]  vases  just left  in his  house  and he's  moving in  with his  new girl  so he didn't  want him  he can't have  the old girl  stuff with  the new girl  no  but apparently  the listeners  want  Troy's  ex-girlfriend's  dead mother's  vases  this is Troy  John  Troy  Troy  John  John's at  Caroline's  all weekend  I mean  I can  understand  that  you know  wanting to  get rid  of stuff  especially  old girl  stuff  but I  guess  my sister 
[03:53:30]  used to  move  her husband's  job  they move  so many  times  that I  got to  the point  where it's  like  I don't  care what  movers  charge  I'm paying  them  I got  so sick  of moving  her couch  the last  time  we got  it out  of the  truck  and she's  like  she's  like  that  goes  upstairs  I'm  like  it  goes  in the  driveway  I'm  leaving  and you  always look  around  and you're  like  what's this  probably take  like three  four hours  to move  everything  and you don't  realize it's  going to take  two days  yeah  it just  I mean 
[03:54:00]  I hate  that whole  you know  the couch  never fits  through the  door  and we got  to get  an angle  on it  and it  was just  I  yeah  I just  end up  wanting to  murder  all your  furniture  you're just  sweating  and you're  carting things  upstairs  I cut my  hands on  walls  and stuff  like that  it just  it sucks  the last  time  we moved  me and  my girl  we couldn't  afford  movers  but I was  like  I'm not  going to  move  this  myself  so we  literally  just gave  a couple  kids  150 bucks  because they  had a van 
[03:54:30]  to move  our stuff  and like  half our  furniture  like all  the upholstery  on the  couches  has holes  and stuff  in it  now  but it's  still  I'd rather  have  shitty  furniture  now  than have  nicer  furniture  that I  had to  move  yeah  you know  what  I'm  with you  I'll deal  with a few  nicks  on the  couch  because it's  usually like  on the  back  I mean  as long as  there's good  sitting  I'm fine  as long as  the sitting  part  yeah  don't fuck  with my  sitting  that's the  difference  I've never  heard an  east coast  comedian  say as  long as  there's  good  sitting  that's 
[03:55:00]  just a  good  phrase  when are  you moving  when's the  move date  August 31st  I have to  move into  a sublet  and then I  move into  my actual  apartment  twice  the worst  I'm in  fucking  hell  have you  packed yet  I didn't  even start  I'm just  trying to  throw  everything  away  or give  it away  yeah  you just  start throwing  shit away  you're like  well I really  like this  and I've  had it for  years  but the  last thing  I want to  do is put  it in a  box  I  you know  I guess  this is  my wife  now is  the first  woman I've  lived with  but I've 
[03:55:30]  never  had a  vase  I've  never had  a vase  the reviews  are in  Joker  is a  caller on  the show  not the  guy from  Aurora  he's a  different  Joker  and he  he called  in to win  Troy's last  vase  and when I  say Troy's  vase I mean  his ex-girlfriend's  dead mom's  dead mother's  vase  correct  and she was a  sweet lady  by the way  you liked her  she was amazing  great taste in  vases  she does  and she  this one  especially  this is the  nicest vase  right 
[03:56:00]  I mean  this is a  beautiful vase  John you've  never had a  vase but  it really  it could be  a bong  but by the  way the  glass is  though  like the  design on  the glass  is kind  of bongy  she was a  little hippie  the dead  mother was  very hippie  it is very  sort of  hypo  whatever  psychedelic  I almost  said  hypodermic  Joker you  won the  first vase  are you  satisfied  with your  prize 
[03:56:30]  yeah  absolutely  and I  kept sending  the pictures  to Troy  and Eric  and you  and it  never got  reposted  for everyone  to see  oh you know  Joker  I will  I'll retweet it  just put some  flowers in it  would you  for me  and then I'll  retweet it  spice it up  a little bit  you know  let's make it  classy  thank you  Joker  and now  Bill  you wanted  you wanted  one of the  vases  absolutely  what's your  favorite color  my favorite  color is blue  or black  blue  okay  well then  this is the  one that's  going to  build  yeah 
[03:57:00]  we're going  to give  you like  the little  we're not  going to  give you  the psychedelic  hypodermic  vase  like a little  green one  I want the  hypodermic one  that's not  going to happen  you'll like  the green one  actually  the green one  has actually  got a classic  feel to it  actually  it's pretty  sweet  this one  should go  to a girl  I think  the psychedelic  one  if the green  one had a lid  on it  you could  make up a  whole story  of how  that's like  your uncle's  ashes  or something  I was just  going to say  that  it does 
[03:57:30]  it looks  like an urn  without a lid  yeah  I do need  an urn  for my parents  so this might  work  and I'll tell  you this  that's paying  it forward  because this  vase came  from Troy's  ex-girlfriend's  dead mother  ashes to ashes  and maybe you  throw your  dead mother's  ashes in there  and right there  it's just  from one dead  person to another  it's heavenly  is what it is  yeah  those morticians  they get you  your weakest  time and you'll  be spending  a lot of  money on an urn  right now  just throw  throw that  throw her  in the fireplace 
[03:58:00]  get the ashes  yourself  put them in  this thing  and you just  got yourself  a free burial  yeah  you guys are  the man  all right  I'm gonna  put you on  hold  so let me  take Bill's  information  because he  just won  the green  vase  this one's  really special  so Sam  I ask you  to please  be considerate  to who  this is  going to  go to  why is  that so  special  well just  because look  how nice  it looks  and then also  this was under  my sink  the one time  and we  smelled something  really bad  and a mouse  actually fell  in this one  and died  in water  so much  death  surrounds that 
[03:58:30]  vase  yeah  but it's  nice  it's a nice  looking vase  so there was  water in it  and a mouse  crawled in  and drowned  and drowned  and then we  didn't know  where the smell  was coming from  did you poison him  and then he  went looking  for water  no  it was just  it was  underneath  the sink  we had this  under there  you didn't even  know he was there  no we just  smelled fucking  hell  what an idiot  yeah  and then we  found the dead  mouse in there  what a stupid  mouse  yeah well  cause generally  there's that  there's a poison  like you get  rats or mice  or whatever  there's a poison  that you give  them that  it makes them  really thirsty 
[03:59:00]  so they  they go  everywhere  trying to  find water  and then  when they  find the water  the water  like blows  up the poison  in their stomach  oh god  it's a real  it's a very cruel  poison  you can't just  poison them  they just  don't just  get the poison  that kills them  but uh  yeah  you trick them  into thinking  they've had  a delicious meal  and they're just  gonna get a nice  beverage  and then their  stomach explodes  man I am  parched  yeah  and it's like  yeah that'll  kill ya  yeah  but I  I remember  like we found  yeah I used to  work at a 
[03:59:30]  swimming pool  where we found  a rat spinning  in a pool filter  because of that  poison  oh cause he was  going he was like  look at all this  water  yeah yeah  he dove in  the pool filter  and like he was  the chlorine  completely bleached  him he was a  completely white  rat  where was the  swimming pool  it was in  Ohio  oh okay  is anybody  answering the  phone  I don't know  Eric's in there  talking to these  he's having one  of his uh  production  lines relax  whoa  we have 10  minutes left  of the show  Eric  whoa  Eric gets a 
[04:00:00]  little feisty  in there sometimes  he doesn't listen  to much of the  show or whatever  what are you doing  in there  talking to Rob  and Sal  about what  Rob and Sal  are the ones  that are supposed  to be answering  the phones  Rob's doing  the phones  we're talking  about things  we found  in swimming  pools  oh my god  why don't you  just have a  private conversation  about it then  as opposed to  joining us  on the air  that's why  we were doing  it so we  wouldn't interrupt  you can  you're welcome  to interrupt  yes  exactly right  the more  the merrier  Jesus  what is this  an intimate  conversation  about swimming  pools and 
[04:00:30]  rats  um  let's see  Kirk  yes  what's up  buddy  I'd like  to win  a vase  you gotta  do something  for it  that's your  game  yeah  hey I'm  here to  win the  vase  yes  I learned  that vases  can be used  as urns  it's too much  vase talk  I'm not gonna  give it to  you Kirk  it's a special  vase  I tried to  tell you how  special it is  where are the  ladies  why would the  ladies  want  trust me  ladies  this is a  nice vase  that's a  nice one  see  yeah 
[04:01:00]  ladies  this is a  nice vase  that a mouse  died in  he was so  thirsty  and then he  was dead  yeah  yeah  um  Bubba  always calls  in though  yeah  he got  something  yesterday  didn't he  yeah Bubba  you won  yesterday  right  no I  didn't win  shit  you actually  dropped me  but it's  cool I  get it  yeah  I have  an effeminate  voice  what did  you learn  hey Rich  was on the  show right  right  I learned  that you can  have a  140 IQ  and still  be a  moron  that's  true  Rich 
[04:01:30]  said he  had a  141 IQ  yeah you  were off  by one  digit  I'm gonna  drop you  again Bubba  because I'm  waiting until  they put  Bonnie on  hold  Bonnie's a  girl's name  right  yeah  that's who  we're looking  for  that is  it's an  effeminate  vase  Rob's on the  other line  just having  a nice  conversation  with her  oh good  generally  really smart  people don't  know their  IQ number  it's just like  look  I'm smart  you realize  that because  of the math  I just did  or whatever  you know 
[04:02:00]  like Stephen Hawking  or whatever  Bill Gates  doesn't have  to go around  throwing around  his IQ number  yeah it's not a  score that he  needs to find out  yeah you appear  to be smarter  than I am  I'll take your  word for it  I'm not gonna  question you  on it  nah I'm gonna  need an exact  number on that  bill  you don't need  to build the  evidence for  yourself that  you are indeed  intelligent  what's up  Bonnie  hey I'm a  girl and I  want a vase  okay  the reason  I initially  said that I  learned that 
[04:02:30]  Rich had a  IQ of 141  too but  then I  learned too  that Rich  has lots of  friends in  Mensa and  he's known  for years what  that means  okay yeah  you know what  that all works  right yeah  Bonnie you sound  like a good  are you a good  looking woman  um I'm  probably older  than you're  how old are  you  what I'm  39 but  don't hang  up on me  no I mean  40 year old  women I mean  those are the  type of women  that probably  need vases  wouldn't you  think  vases are not  generally for 
[04:03:00]  the young  well she knows  what to do  with it  yeah yeah  yeah yeah  yeah we like  post a picture  of this for  Troy  oh my god  totally  all right  I'm gonna  put you on  hold  congratulations  to you  Troy you  don't have to  move with  this thing  yeah and I  also have  something very  cool that I  want to do  next week  I have a  as cool as  your cutlery  and vases  this might be  cool I have  like a punk  rock gift bag  that I'm gonna  be giving away  okay  all right  sounds good  it's really nice  it's a misfits  bag and there's  gonna be a lot  of cool punk  rock stuff in  there  well I can't 
[04:03:30]  wait for the  grab bag  can I also  mention that I'll  be DJing tomorrow  in Philly  yeah good luck  I'm at the  man center opening  for train  that's huge  if you're going  after the show  get there early  and check me  out  that's huge  and if you're  in New York  John will be  at Caroline's  all weekend  I also wanted  to ask you  you mentioned  the blue collar  guys before  that must have  been before  you started  doing stuff  with Chelsea  well yeah  was that kind  of the first  big thing  they tried to  do a  no I was  on let's  see  big I was  on I was  on Vince  Vaughn's  Wild West  comedy show  oh okay  we we we 
[04:04:00]  filmed that  movie in  2005 it  didn't come  out until  08 though  and then I  was on  they they  did a we  did like a  blue collar  comedy the  next generation  it only lasted  like we did  a special for  TBS and it  didn't you know  last that long  and I hate  when people  yell get her  done at me  so I basically  tried to shun  that whole thing  yeah well what's  your new catch  what is it  is sitting's  good I you  know what  that's gonna be  the new shit  yeah yeah  yeah that's 
[04:04:30]  yeah I'm fine  with that but  yeah don't please  don't yell  fucking get her  done at me  do you get a lot  like even though  like you were  the next generation  blue collar I  mean those fans  are kind of  rabbit do you  get a lot of  blue collar fans  um you know  what the thing  for me is like  that after is  it's like I  honestly like the  people who like  blue collar comedy  generally like  they they like  my comedy but  it's like people  who people who  don't like blue  collar comedy  generally don't  like that you  know right  and the thing is  like with Larry 
[04:05:00]  the cable guy if  you're not  he's polarizing  and that's the  thing is like I'm  I'm not I'm not  one or the other  I'm just kind of  like I can kind of  I can fit in with  that because you  know because generally  my comedy is just  pretty straightforward  and honest  right  and so but it's  like I I don't I  hate getting the  the blue collar  label because then  it's I feel like  you know a lot of  people are gonna  look at that and  go oh fucking  so yeah so you  must have been  psyched when you  started getting  associated with  Chelsea Handler  yeah it really it  uh it was just 
[04:05:30]  really cool because  I like I mean I  had a lot of uh  you know I had I  had a lot of I  had a lot of dude  fans before that and  then you know like  all of a sudden  their girlfriends knew  who I was and  yeah so it was  like that that  helped for uh  people coming to  see my show  and Norton says  Norton Jim Norton  always says whenever  he's in the west  coast and on the  west coast and does  Chelsea's show  yeah he can't  believe how huge  the show is  it's yeah it's  it's really really  it's and it was  one of those things  when we started  doing it in 07 it 
[04:06:00]  felt kind of like  underground like just  this cool like you  know it was fun to  do and you know  only a couple of us  got to do it and I  never knew what I  would like I don't  know anything about  Lindsay Lohan or  anything so I don't  know what I'm talking  about on there but  it was it was fun and  then all of a sudden  like about like 2009  we started you know  realizing like how  many people were  actually watching the  show it was yeah it  was really really  cool it's because I  mean I'd been on TV  shows before like you  know but it's a lot  different when you're 
[04:06:30]  on a TV show people  watch yeah it makes a  big difference this is  what people meant when  they talk about being  on TV yeah yeah well  thanks for coming by  thank you for having  me on check out  Johnny's at Caroline's  all weekend so go to  carolines.com and get  tickets for that Troy  are you gonna be at  Rob's pool party on  Saturday no you'll be  in Philadelphia DJ  Rob's pool party is  gonna be a bust our  interns trying to throw  a pool party nobody's  going to it it's gonna  be such a bust I'm not  gonna go nobody's  gonna go right nobody's  really gonna are you  going rolling I have  no ride yeah I'm not
