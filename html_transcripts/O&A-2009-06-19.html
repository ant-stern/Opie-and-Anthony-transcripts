<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts recounting their hangovers and relationship woes, sharing humorous anecdotes about arguments with their girlfriends and the challenges of sleeping after a fight.  Bill Burr, a guest comedian, joined the conversation, contributing his own experiences and observations on the subjective nature of "yelling." The weather in New York, specifically the persistent rain, became a topic, leading to discussions about the expensive endeavor of heating a pool and one host’s experience falling asleep in his jacuzzi.

The release of the new iPhone dominated a significant portion of the show. The hosts criticized a local news report's use of outdated Blackberry footage and focused heavily on their intern, Evan's, attempts to purchase an iPhone 3GS for one of them at the Apple store. This endeavor was met with numerous obstacles: long lines, in-person account activation requirements, and insufficient funds on one host's part, resulting in humorous exchanges about borrowing money and "juice" (interest). The hosts' frustration and expletive-laden commentary on the process, including ideas like using a photo for verification, highlighted the perceived absurdities of the purchasing process and phone company business practices. A caller shared a similar frustrating experience with the XM Sirius app, leading to a broader discussion on the app's functionality and the potential disruption of traditional radio. Several other callers echoed similar frustrations with iPhone purchases and phone companies.  The conversation broadened to include discussions with Burr about modern technology, the entertainment industry, and celebrity culture.

Evan's live, on-the-street report attempting to acquire an iPhone became a major segment.  The hosts and Burr provided running commentary as Evan encountered massive crowds, media coverage, and ultimately failed to get a phone.  This segment included numerous instances of crude and irreverent humor, with suggestions for chants such as "Put it in your cunt," "I'm here, I'm queer, I want my iPhone," "Bait and switch," and "Pussy yuck," along with mocking the iPhone buyers' enthusiasm.  An anonymous caller claiming to work at the Apple store offered to procure iPhones "under the table."  The hosts also discussed a news story about a pilot dying mid-flight, speculating humorously about the handling of the situation. Burr shared a story about witnessing a drunk woman's arrest, commenting on perceived double standards in police treatment of men and women. Several listeners called in with unrelated stories, including a paramedic whose partner died on the job and a story about a lobsterman's death at sea.  The segment concluded with Evan and Sam Roberts returning to the studio without an iPhone.


Following the iPhone saga, the show continued with further discussion of the mid-flight death, introducing "Little Nicky," a daily studio regular, and including a call from John in Jersey contributing to the pilot death jokes.  The hosts then discussed the story of Louis Bosco, a 44-year-old landlord who secretly videotaped his 16-year-old tenant, exploring the salacious details and comedic absurdity of his actions.  This segued into a discussion about parental responsibility and trusting strangers with children, escalating into increasingly vulgar hypothetical scenarios.  A caller, Corey, commented on the show’s humor, particularly a joke about Opie’s preference for pregnant women, launching a lengthy, sexually explicit discussion about pregnant women’s bodies. The conversation also touched upon criticisms of wealthy parents' detachment from their children.  A caller, Brett, mentioned his new iPhone, transitioning the discussion to the lack of privacy in modern society compared to the past. This led to a story about a friend receiving an unfair traffic ticket, which spiraled into a tangent about perceived abuse of power by traffic enforcement officers, focusing on their racial demographics.  The hosts showed a video by "Jimmy Justice" confronting officers.

The final segment focused on the hosts' love for golf and video games. Opie requested U.S. Open tickets, leading to discussions about following golfers, other sporting events (like the Indianapolis 500), and excessive drinking at these events.  They then discussed their video game habits, particularly Brick Breaker, sharing humorous anecdotes.  The conversation concluded with reflections on the futility of college education, financial struggles of young adults, and the demographics of certain professions (traffic enforcement and professional sports).  The show ended with a caller discussing a bizarre tractor pull event.

A segment dedicated to redneck culture featured anecdotes about various events, including a child baseball prodigy dropping out of high school, a woman flashing her breasts and using dip snuff at Talladega, toilet seat horseshoes, greased pig chases, chitlin-eating contests, truck pulls, noodling, goat races (with goats sometimes being hit), and RV and school bus races.  Johnny Fairplay (*Survivor*) and Bobo (a frequent caller) were in studio guests.  Numerous callers from Southern states contributed "redneck" sayings. A video clip of noodling was shown and discussed.  A portion focused on a caller’s "Bobo Springsteen" impersonation and Bobo's desire for a 1988 Mustang Cobra.  The hosts also briefly commented on the discomfort of their studio chairs.


A final segment featured Bobo as a guest, beginning with a discussion about modifying an '88 Mustang.  The conversation quickly shifted to Bobo's planned introduction of Rich Voss at the Stress Factory, with repeated misinterpretations and exaggerations leading to a running gag about Bobo wanting to have sex with his long-lost half-brother. Bobo rehearsed his introduction, incorporating increasingly inappropriate humor.  The discussion then turned to Bobo's Twitter account and his upcoming appearance.  Johnny Fairplay's boxing match against Michael Lohan was mentioned, leading to a physical altercation between Bobo and Fairplay in the studio over a stolen hat, fueled by the ongoing misinterpretations.  The fight ended without serious injury.  The segment concluded with promotion of Fairplay's boxing match and Bobo's stand-up performance, along with further humorous and sexually suggestive remarks from the hosts and Bobo about his sex life, including wearing condoms to bed. Bill Burr’s appearance was briefly mentioned as having ended before this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, yes, let's get the show on the road.  Friday, we are live.  Live programming for you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Starring Bill Burr today.  Who's already making us laugh really hard.  I can't believe how wide awake I am.  Really?  I was telling you guys, I went out last night.  I was telling Sherrod,  and I'm like, come on, man, let's drink or whatever.  We had a couple of drinks. 
[00:00:30]  I completely forgot I was coming in.  You're like, oh, shit, wait a minute.  I got to get up at an ungodly hour and do radio.  Yeah, I was arguing with my girlfriend over nothing about some shit.  And right in the middle, I was like, you know what?  I'm going to bed.  And then I realized, oh, shit, I really have to go to bed.  I have to go to bed.  I got to get up in a few hours.  She could have got you by continuing the argument.  Because that was the worst thing that would ever happen in a relationship  was when I would be like, you don't understand.  I have to go to sleep right now. 
[00:01:00]  Shut up.  If you really loved me, you'd stay up.  How can you go to sleep just thinking about easily?  If you shut the fuck up, I could just close my eyes.  They don't understand that we could just fall asleep like that.  It doesn't matter if there's turmoil in the house.  To us, we're like, look, we'll pick this up tomorrow.  Yeah.  After work, not them, though.  Got to sleep.  They have to figure it out right there.  Yep.  Right there.  Oh, it's the worst.  And then you fall asleep. 
[00:01:30]  And then they do that shit where they just put their hand on your shoulder.  For some reason, that's enough to wake you up.  And you're like, I can't sleep.  I'm sorry.  I know you have to go to work, but I just, this is just really bothering me.  What?  Don't yell at me.  It's like, I'm going to fucking smother you with this goddamn pill.  I hate when they say, don't yell at me.  And you're not even yelling.  No.  It's like, I'm fucking, this is not yelling.  Have you ever fallen asleep as they woke you up and they're like babbling?  Oh, on the phone all the time. 
[00:02:00]  About the argument or something.  And then you just, you start the heavy breathing.  I think Bill and I are like separated at birth.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a few years behind you.  That's it.  The same thing.  Like, don't yell at me.  And I look around the room like, is there someone else in the room yelling?  Because, wow, I'll show you yelling.  I hate everybody else's definition of yelling.  Thank you.  It's so fucking bad.  In my household, yelling was just normal. 
[00:02:30]  Was yelling.  Oh, my God.  Well, but the yelling that other people think is yelling, that was just normal in our house.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's just talking.  Yeah, to a lot of them, just like being like, you know, if you curse and you bring your voice up to, dude, what the fuck did you put that there for?  Right.  That's yelling.  Yeah, that's not yelling in my life.  It's like, oh, that's not yelling.  No, not at all.  That's not yelling.  No.  Far cry from it.  This one goes up to 11.  Oh, yeah.  Let me show you some yelling.  Yeah.  My brother actually was dating a girl a long time ago, and she did that. 
[00:03:00]  She was literally like, stop yelling at me.  And he goes, I'm not yelling.  And then he just went like, this is yelling.  Yelling.  It's like listening to death metal.  It's like listening to classic rock and saying, that's death metal.  No, this is death metal.  It turns to Leonidas.  Yeah.  That's yelling.  Yeah, when your hair starts moving, that's when I'm yelling.  Everything else is I'm showing you respect.  Right.  Absolutely. 
[00:03:30]  Where do we begin today?  Well, it's not raining.  Yeah.  I know the rest of the country is sick of us talking about the weather in the New York area.  I'm disgusted, and I'm talking about it.  I'm so sick of this fucking weather.  They're calling it the June monsoons.  Whatever they want to call it.  Well, it rhymes.  It sucks.  That's probably why, right?  It's going to make our summer go by in the blink of an eye when it finally does get nice here.  It's going to get nice, and then it's going to be over. 
[00:04:00]  The rain was amazing yesterday.  Wow.  It was just amazing.  Yeah.  It was like one really long shower.  Yeah, I picked a great time to start the heating of the pool process, by the way.  56 degrees and raining, and I'm trying to keep this thing at 85 degrees.  My electric bill is fucking just insanity.  I was over ants yesterday, and the steam that comes off his jacuzzi and pool.  That's not a good thing.  Dude, I hate heated pools. 
[00:04:30]  They give me a stomachache.  I love a good heated pool.  It's like wading into urine.  I love a good heated pool.  You'd rather just, like, jump in and have that initial shock, but then you're nice and  nice and comfortable.  You know something?  This summer or spring has been so fucked that every pool is freezing.  That's what I said.  It looks like when Martin Sheen comes out of that swamp and apocalypse.  That's my pool.  I can't take ice-cold water.  It sucks.  And there's been no sun. 
[00:05:00]  It's been raining like a son of a bitch.  So I'm just, my electric bill is just pumping heat into a pool.  So it's like 60 degrees out, and you kick off your slippers and wade into the pool with  your glass of wine?  I get in.  I had a, actually, I just had a Pilsner glass of Bud Light, and I went out and fell asleep  in the jacuzzi.  I just put my head back with a pillow.  I can't imagine that.  With a towel behind it.  That's healthy.  And just, like, sat there.  And then I woke up, and the outdoor lights were on. 
[00:05:30]  It was kind of getting dark out.  And I'm like, ah, that was nice.  If I stay in a jacuzzi too long, I get hives.  Nah, it's great.  You don't get hives or anything?  It wasn't boiling hot.  From your body heating up?  Nah, it wasn't boiling hot.  It was, you know, regulated.  A little thermostat action.  You know, like the glass of beer and everything else, I was right with you.  But then just to have that heat.  That's fantastic, too.  Oh, the iPhone comes out today.  You hear me?  He's like, no.  That's fantastic.  This is the tail end of the E-Rock flu that that idiot brought in here. 
[00:06:00]  E-Rock decided he was going to come in sick.  And he came in and, you know, made me sick.  So now I've been doing that gulp where you feel like you got something in your throat.  You keep swallowing, and then you realize it's just your fucking, that stupid punching bag.  The gulping is the worst.  And you just know you're getting sick because of it?  Yeah, you get the gulp, and the only thing you want to do is sleep because you're under the weather.  And you just, all night long, you're waking up because you're gulping. 
[00:06:30]  I sound all sexy today.  Got my sexy.  Boy, I'll say.  My sexy raspy boy.  I just out of nowhere said, wow, the iPhone, because we got, I got to explain to the newer listeners,  we have like eight TVs in here, and every once in a while something pops on the TV,  and you want to like just all of a sudden maybe bring it to the show.  Yeah.  The iPhone comes out today, and what bothers me, this dumb Channel 11 here in New York,  a local news station.  Yeah.  I hate the news more and more every day, especially the local news.  They're doing a story on phones, and somehow they saved the BlackBerry into the fact that 
[00:07:00]  the iPhone is coming out today.  Uh-huh.  And they got stock footage of, oh, you saw it, Danny?  They got stock footage of the BlackBerry where they still have antennas.  Oh, the old one, right.  The older versions of the BlackBerry, and that's just some lazy guy that works for Channel 11  and not updating the stock footage of the BlackBerry.  Uh-huh.  So they show some guy scrolling on like a real old BlackBerry that has to be like four years old.  Scroll, scroll.  And in the phone world, four years, I mean, that's ridiculous, right? 
[00:07:30]  It's crazy.  Are you getting your iPhone today?  Uh, where's an intern?  What?  Go over to the Apple store.  Get me my iPhone right now.  He's going to have to wait on line and all that.  I don't see a line.  You could get it right now?  Look, they're at the Apple store.  I thought there were going to be really long lines today.  Not in this economy.  Oh, that's a good point.  Might be later as an intern.  You need to see.  Bobby Kelly will be, he'll be over there.  Bobby likes the iPhone?  I bet he will.  What kind of phone are you on, Bill? 
[00:08:00]  I actually, I finally caved in and I got a BlackBerry.  How much is the big one?  Bill, separated birth, me and you.  How much is the big one?  See, look at that.  Yeah.  I think it's the exact same one, too.  I think the same color.  Travis knows.  300.  That'd be funny if you start fucking your life up and I start getting nervous.  Like, God, that's what's going to happen to me in four years.  I know we got an intern wandering around that's not doing anything right now.  No.  I want my fucking iPhone right now. 
[00:08:30]  You got the money ready to go?  I got it right now and I want the best one.  The best.  He actually had that in his pocket in his pool.  It was just so hot it was already dried out.  You know what you're doing?  Nothing.  He doesn't listen.  You know what you're doing?  See, he's in another world.  We could just talk and he won't even know that.  That's what we're talking about.  I know.  Oh, now you know?  Okay.  That's five.  Five bills.  I think it's three.  That's Evan.  Look at him.  Five $100.  He has like payola in his shirt from the 70s.  You know where the Apple store is?  Oh, look it up.  Wait a minute.  Look it up.  Evan does... 
[00:09:00]  No.  Evan's been here too long to have to fetch stuff.  Swivel hips?  Swivel hips.  Swivel hips.  It's time to hold your ground.  Well, should you trust a new intern with us?  Oh, all right.  That's true.  That's true.  Evan's buying an Ansi-file.  That's true.  Go get it.  Go down there.  One that just looks like this one.  Black.  Black.  You got it.  Black.  Because I think...  Are they white and black?  Travis?  I hope he buys you an old one.  It was on sale.  And it's the...  There was no lines or anything.  The 3GS.  And if they want any info, you say, I'm buying it for a very important man. 
[00:09:30]  So don't fuck with me.  Just give me the box.  Here's your money.  It's the iPhone 3GS.  Not the 3G.  3GS.  The brandy new one.  In, you know, the black color.  You got it.  You are the man.  3GS.  All right.  Here's a mission.  What?  What?  Danny?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yes, Danny?  Well, the 290...  I mean, the 300, that's the subsidized price.  What's subsidized?  That means if you sign a contract, but you already have a contract, right?  I have a contract.  Oh, man.  Evan could have made a few bucks. 
[00:10:00]  You're going to have to pay a little more.  Oh, all right.  Well, he gave him 500.  Whatever it is.  What's that to a man who can heat his pool during the monsoon season?  Exactly.  I have AT&T.  I have a contract.  You tell the guy, I'm buying it for somebody.  Very important.  He can't come down here.  It can't be seen in a store like this, so he's buying it.  I'm a made guy.  Yeah, I'm a made man.  So you go down there, pick it up in the box.  I have it.  All I got to do is sync it up. 
[00:10:30]  You ask him that.  Go.  He's got one.  All he's got to do is sync it up.  I think he understands.  And then put the new phone in and fucking transfer his shit over.  He understands.  He's trying to make it important.  It's very easy.  What, sir?  I just want to make sure the contract price is enough.  Did you give me enough of that?  Oh, I better have.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  You know we're broadcasting, right?  All right, there you go.  Okay.  Yes.  All right.  It's very important.  Let's say hi to...  It's big news today.  I got to get that phone.  Let's say hi to Nick.  Speaking of the iPhone, Nick, what do you got today?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[00:11:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, Bill.  Love your stuff.  Thank you.  I just want to let you guys know that I was online last night.  I listen all the time.  I was listening yesterday about the XM Sirius app, and I know you guys weren't in the description.  They did change that.  You guys are now in the description right before Jamie Foxx in the foxhole says the virus with  Opie and Anthony on the description when you're buying the app.  See?  Looks like someone around here had to eat a little crow.  Little...  I was telling the head, and I go, and that's why we bitch on our radio show. 
[00:11:30]  We don't bitch just to bitch.  We bitch to get things done.  Yes.  And I want to thank the company for once again seeing it our way.  Yep.  That's it.  That's how it works.  Once again, proving that we know more than you.  Yeah.  Well, I got to agree with you guys.  I mean, you guys are definitely by far the workhorses of that company.  And, I mean, if you look on reviews, it says, like, no, Howard, this sucks.  So the app's going to get a shitty review because Howard's not on it. 
[00:12:00]  But what people don't realize is, like, how good the app is because you guys are on it.  Like, I love the app.  I used it all day yesterday.  I got to listen to the whole show for the first time.  Yeah, the app is amazing.  I mean, we were bitching and complaining yesterday, but we all checked it out.  And, wow, this is going to pretty much destroy regular radio.  I think this is the final step.  Yeah, I'd say this is the first fully portable satellite radio that actually works.  Yeah, because I love the – I had an XM portable radio.  I loved it.  And it was small and stuff. 
[00:12:30]  But in this world, you want everything on your phone.  Can I get that on my BlackBerry?  Yes, there is a way to do it on the BlackBerry.  Not as easy as the –  Of course not.  Well, it's not as easy as the iPhone app, but I'm sure they're working on some kind of BlackBerry app as well.  I would imagine.  I don't know because I don't really talk to anyone around here.  I just like Verizon.  I can't deal with AT&T.  Really?  I got the AT&T.  It's great.  As long as I don't make phone calls from my apartment.  It's all the same.  You're the only guy I ever heard say AT&T is great.  It's all the same.  It's great.  I'm not saying it's great.  I'm just saying.  All the same. 
[00:13:00]  I've had every service.  You wanted to throw your phone through the window when you first got it.  And I've had plenty of phones I wanted to throw through the window with Sprint and fucking Verizon and every other goddamn phone company.  Sprint sucked.  Verizon's been great for me.  See?  And you watch your mouth around me when you talk about Verizon, sir.  Hey, we're losing Nick.  Nick, thank you.  No problem, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  Why is it costing me more if I'm already a customer?  Because they're cunts. 
[00:13:30]  Wait, Travis is saying I have to activate the phone there?  Yeah.  Why is that, Travis?  Well, just like when you got the 3G, it had to be activated to your account.  Why can't I do that at home on my computer?  They won't let you walk out of the store without that phone being on an account.  Why?  Because if they're selling it to you at that price, AT&T wants to know that it's going to be like that they're going to be getting the money for that phone.  So what do I have to do?  I have to give them my phone now and have them go down there?  I think you have to go down there. 
[00:14:00]  What if Obama wanted to fucking get his iPhone today?  Does he have to stand in an Apple store?  No, he probably pre-ordered online.  See?  No.  What if fucking anybody?  You go down there and get your iPhone.  He just got off a good point.  You could have pre-ordered online.  Yeah, why didn't you pre-order it?  Why would I pre-order it?  What, and wait to get it fucking Monday, maybe?  No, they're all shipped today.  Bullshit, they are not shipped today. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, UPS actually had to hold back.  Bull fucking shit.  You know, it says right here in the post that they're all shipped out today.  No, it doesn't.  It says pumped on the cover.  I'm looking right at it.  No, you're not.  You're lying.  Yes, I am.  Because I'm looking at the same one.  You're looking at it upside down.  You're full of shit.  I'm not going to sit there.  Why can't I fucking buy something and just have it?  I give them money, they give me the product.  I don't get it.  And why is it costing me $450 if I don't sign a new contract?  Because they're cunts.  It's going to cost you $450 if you don't sign a new contract.  That's Mike in Connecticut.  Just replace your phone. 
[00:15:00]  Just take that one off your account and put this one on.  That's what I want to do.  Why can't I do that at home?  That's all I got to do.  It could all be done on the miracle of the computer.  Yeah, it can.  So why do I got to do it down there?  Here's what happened to me.  That's why there's 8,000 fucking people on a line.  You can do it all on Apple's website.  That's what I want to do.  You can do it last week.  So why can't this guy just fucking buy me my phone, I go home with my phone, and my new phone?  Because he needs your AT&T information.  No, that's not why. 
[00:15:30]  That's not why.  What they're trying to do is get you...  Wait a second.  Someone's coming in.  Wait, Evan's back.  Holy shit.  Go on to my problem.  I just want to know what size you wanted.  Because it comes in a variety of...  I said the bestest one they make.  Okay.  The biggest and bestest.  No, let's go podcast.  The biggest and bestest.  But now I'm hearing there's a problem.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I'm hearing now through Travis that the phone has to be activated there. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, that's what I was reading.  Now, what is...  They don't tell you why.  Why?  They want everybody to do it and get used to doing it on the computer so they can fire  all the people down there so it's cheaper for them.  So what they do is they can't just give you the phone down there.  They have to punish you.  So what they're doing is they're gradually training you to do everything.  I mean, I'm telling you, within four years you'll be building the phone yourself.  They'll just give a soldering iron and some fucking circuit boards.  Or if you want one that's already made, you can stand in line for nine hours. 
[00:16:30]  I want to know what I got to do to have someone else go to that store and buy my fucking phone for me.  Well, how did you get your phone last year?  I stood on a God-shitting line at the Roosevelt Field Mall in front of the Apple Store and waited  and then went in and had some guy fucking with his beep, beep, beep tricorder in his hand.  It's the same thing you've got to do this year.  But I don't want to.  What if someone else can do that for me? 
[00:17:00]  What info does he need to go down there?  He probably needs your AT&T account info and he might need some other more personal info.  Maybe some email addresses or...  What if...  Why?  Why?  I bet Evan, knowing Evan the way I know him, can get this done via power of persuasion.  Let's do it, Evan.  Look.  All right, let's do it.  You go down there.  Sam, maybe you should go down...  Why don't you give him $600?  A little payola.  Yeah, a little payola.  You go down there and say, look, here's the deal. 
[00:17:30]  There's somebody...  Don't give him the name.  Just say it's a very important person.  Cannot just come down to the store.  He needs his phone today.  Today.  Okay.  And then if you need any info or anything, you get on the phone, you get on the horn, you call up.  How about he calls the show?  Exactly.  If you can't get a phone, call the show and we'll...  Call the show and we'll talk you through it.  We'll talk you down.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah.  Sounds good.  That's the job. 
[00:18:00]  But the big...  The big one.  The 32.  I want the 32 black, sleek, nice.  All right.  Well, is the 32...  Is that $3.99 or $4.99?  On the contract.  Is this a salesman or a radio show host?  No, because there's going to be tax.  I just want to...  He's not going to have enough money.  For real.  Oh, he's going back into...  Evan, typically...  People say it's up to...  The biggest and best one is the cheaper model.  Oh, shit.  He's out of money.  I just don't know if that's...  He went back into his blood money and he came out with a bunch of singles. 
[00:18:30]  Crumpled singles.  Oh, shit.  Looks like a seventh grader in a cafeteria.  Is it that one?  No way.  Is it that much?  Hold on.  Now it's a thing.  Instead of a little thing, now it's a big thing.  Joe in Boston, what's up?  Yeah, there's no way he's getting that phone.  When I tried to do this, they wanted my picture ID.  There were all kinds of shit.  They would not give you a phone.  Unless you're standing there in front of them, you're not getting a phone.  I don't understand this. 
[00:19:00]  Is it because...  I don't either.  Is it because too many people are jailbreaking them?  Getting them somewhere else and...  They're Nazis with their phones.  I tried to get a replacement because I broke...  Nazis.  They throw that word around a lot these days.  Yeah, what happens when you break a phone?  Mine was broken.  I go into the store and this fucking asshole behind the counter, he's like, well, let's  do this to it.  Well, let's do that to it.  I said, I've done it.  I've done it.  I've done it.  Just give me a new phone.  Give me a new phone.  He would not give it to me.  Finally, I pissed him off so bad. 
[00:19:30]  He goes...  He takes three new ones, puts them on the counter.  He goes, all right, fine.  You pick one.  You pick one.  You see which one's going to work for you.  I said, give me that one.  He said, okay.  It's just going to happen again.  And he was pissed off, asshole.  I walked out of the store with a new phone, though.  See, I don't deal with that with the BlackBerry.  Fuck, man.  It's always nice and easy.  They don't need all this info.  I just buy a phone.  Let's say hi to Cody in Indiana.  Cody!  Yeah, I had to agree with that other caller. 
[00:20:00]  Yesterday, I talked to a guy at AT&T, and he said what you have to do.  They'll send him to an Apple store.  Send him to a corporate AT&T store that sells them.  And first, you have to call a number and authorize him to be someone to make changes on your account.  And make sure that he's kind of sketchy.  I don't want to authorize him for anything.  I want to authorize him to buy a fucking product.  You won't get it, then.  Sorry, man.  Why don't you just write him a note and be like, it's okay if my intern, Evan. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  It's kind of scary.  You can't just go in and just buy a phone.  They're now forcing you to get their service contracts and all that bullshit.  Anthony, why don't you just wait a week and then just waltz in right out of your heated pool?  Because I need to have the video capability.  All right, well, send Evan down.  This will be a good experiment and see what happens.  Send him down and see what happens.  Rick, what's going on?  The reason they won't let you just buy the phone is because AT&T doesn't really make money off the phone.  They make money off the plan, and people are buying those phones and unlocking them. 
[00:21:00]  And if you look on eBay, I mean, I don't know about now, but a few months ago, they were selling them for like $1,000.  And people over in, like, China were buying them because they can't get the iPhone over there or whatever.  Hold on, Evan.  Tell Evan to hold on.  Why, Evan?  I got an idea.  Oh, no.  Give Evan the USA Today ad and have him point at my name.  Okay.  Here's the ad.  Say we're selling a lot of iPhones today because we're great radio broadcasters. 
[00:21:30]  And say, see this name?  See this name on the big, see, there's a big thing.  Now playing on your iPhone and iPod Touch.  See, go down here and go, see that name right there?  That's the guy that I'm buying a phone for.  His name's right next to the fucking product in the newspaper.  I'll do everything in my power to get you this phone.  That's to prevent someone from doing that.  Anybody.  Who's going to do that?  Huh?  Who's going to make it?  Well, now that you said it on the radio.  Well, fuck everybody else.  How about you take it?  Hold on.  That could be Bob.  Hold on, hold on.  That is how you live. 
[00:22:00]  That's your life right there.  Fuck everybody else.  I'm trying to help you out.  What's the matter?  Do you have a phone with a picture?  Yeah.  Take a picture of you and Anthony in front of the microphone.  I'm buying the phone for this guy.  And then you can also show the logo that's on his mic stand that's in the USA ad.  Hold up the phone.  I'll hold up the phone.  It's like a hostage thing.  Yeah, hold up a newspaper.  That's what I'm saying.  Give me the newspaper with the ad. 
[00:22:30]  Give me the newspaper with the ad.  Turn your mic flag around because it says O.P. and Anthony.  Same logo that's in the USA today.  There you go.  All right, now let's make bets.  Who thinks this is going to work?  I say no fucking way.  All right, now get behind Anthony.  Anthony's holding up the USA Today article, his iPhone, the mic stand.  It's obvious he's broadcasting.  Make it straighter.  Make it straighter.  The O.P. and Anthony logo on the wall behind you.  You got the picture?  Now show the people at the Apple store that you're buying a phone for that guy. 
[00:23:00]  You go, see this picture?  It's all you should need.  See?  That's all you should need.  Right there.  It's not going to work.  All the info.  It's not going to work.  Oh, it's got to work.  One more thing.  The best one is $4.99 on contract price.  So with tax, I'm going to need a little extra.  Yeah, you're going to need at least another $100.  You can give him as much money as you want.  He's not coming out of there with a phone.  Dude, that corporate mentality.  I'm sorry, sir.  They don't let us.  I know, sir.  I would be upset too, but they don't.  They don't.  That's what they do.  But I, but I. 
[00:23:30]  You're not going to get one.  You're not going to get one.  What's tax on $500?  I don't pay tax on anything.  $700?  It's like $40 and change.  $42, $43.  Is that how much?  Yeah.  No, it's like $20 on the $100, isn't it?  $43.  $42.  Who's got $50?  I'll pay it back right after the show.  I just got to go to an ATM.  Tell you what.  I'll loan you the $50.  But if you don't get it, you got to pay me a VIG of $25.  You got to give me $75 back. 
[00:24:00]  Fucking VIG.  I like that idea.  Huh?  You like that?  I like that idea.  I'll fucking lean juice, motherfucker.  I'll loan shark you.  Yeah, my $50 will now cost you $100.  Oh, you got $25 on you?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You got to pay the juice.  You got to pay the juice.  I am not paying the juice.  Well, then you're not getting your goddamn phone.  Oh, no iPhone.  No iPhone.  Oh, well.  Why is this such a chore?  It's the red-headed brothers.  I don't like this at all.  Separated at birth.  That's right.  Twisting your arm.  I got $25, but I need to get $3. 
[00:24:30]  You got $3.  You got $3.  I got $3.  Wait a minute.  There we go.  There's a couple of fives.  I'm up to $13.  Oh, my God.  You're a broke-ass motherfucker.  Fuck you.  You don't even have $25.  Don't bite the hands at feeds.  You really don't have $25.  No, I don't.  You started this.  It was a great idea, but I don't know.  It just kind of fizzled up.  We ran out of cash, like a lot of things.  He was making fun of me for having $3 in my pocket.  It's after I took $500 out.  Hey, they cut my budget.  It's a tough time.  How much do you need?  I got $15, $16, $17, $18. 
[00:25:00]  That's how I roll.  I'll give you the $50, and I want the $50 back and my wedding gift by Monday.  Oh, that's, you know, something.  You don't have an iPhone, right?  Yeah, but that'd be good to send Evan with an iPhone, someone suggesting this, with an  iPhone, running the show, so that you could hold it up to the guy and say, okay, here  it is.  I'm talking to the guy.  And then I could go, hello, look, it's me.  And I talk to him through the radio. 
[00:25:30]  This is, all kidding aside, this is why I don't get an iPhone.  This is it right here.  And if BlackBerry starts this crap, then I'm out, as far as BlackBerrys go.  I go in a store, and I buy the latest BlackBerry, done.  Don't have to buy their stupid contracts, nothing.  Yeah, but they have a little scam, too, when you're up for the upgrade.  Rather than just giving you the upgrade price, it's like they charge you the full price, then  you have eight minutes to send in that fucking coupon.  And you're always like, you're not getting me!  And then life hits you, and then you're like, then it's too late. 
[00:26:00]  They do play the coupon game.  As long as you get this in the mail by tomorrow.  Yeah.  Listen, if you charge him money, that'll be great, because he doesn't have the money.  Well, actually, he will, because I'll bring it back.  I just want, at some point, to have him go to an ATM.  I go to an ATM.  Evan and Sam, why don't you head to the Apple store and see what we can get done.  You don't have enough money.  What?  Now I need an extra 50 bucks.  We don't have enough money.  I'm just looking to borrow it for fucking, like...  How are we going to get in?  We don't have money. 
[00:26:30]  Like, I'm just looking to borrow it for a few minutes.  Just a few minutes.  Yeah, somebody just go over there and fail, so I can enjoy the rest of my day, knowing that he's pissed.  I just want a fucking...  Yeah, it's not happening.  50 bucks.  Oh, well.  For fucking, like...  You should have been nicer to me.  Look at Soriano.  Why did the Yankees get rid of him?  I love it.  Where's an ATM?  Although Cano's great.  I'll run down there on a commercial break, motherfuckers.  Maybe they can put it on your bill.  How about you go, eh?  Maybe they can put the balance on your bill.  On my bill?  And you go...  Bill.  You go... 
[00:27:00]  What, do I got a tab down there?  You go, get on your iPhone, and let's walk the people through the process.  You want me to go down to the Apple store?  Well, I can do that.  Why don't we stretch out the bit and have him fail first, so he can get mad, go on his  rant, and then storm down there.  Then he'll be upset.  I want Anthony mad.  Yeah, you fail first.  Yeah.  Then I'll go down there angry that I had to come down there.  All right.  Now we're working.  Do you raise holy hell?  I want a fuckless tirade.  I'll fucking go crazy.  I'll be playing.  I'll come down with the show playing on here going, you hear this? 
[00:27:30]  Look, I'll talk on the phone, and then it's like, now you hear me out of this, don't you?  You hear me?  They're going to think you're a lunatic.  Of course they will.  I'll be arrested.  You can buy a phone for $5.99 with no contracts.  Not the $32, though.  But I...  Dude.  But why would I buy one without a fucking contract?  Getting a lot of...  I need the contract.  Call AT&T store.  Use the app to tell them it's okay.  Need social security number, phone number, and various other proofs of ID. 
[00:28:00]  I'm buying a phone, not getting fucking security clearance for the CIA.  I'm sorry, sir.  I understand.  But you just...  No, you don't understand.  Oh, now there's a line.  There's a line.  Now there's a line.  There's a line.  See, you just...  I'm not waiting on a line.  So Evan, just ask if it's okay if you go in front of a few people.  Oh, just...  Yeah, send somebody over there to fail.  Now there's a big line.  No, those are people milling.  Nope.  Big line.  Line.  They got the barriers.  But there wasn't a line.  They had the line somewhere else, and now they moved it up toward the store because they  didn't want to, you know...  Hey, any time you're in a line that the news is filming, you're a fucking loser. 
[00:28:30]  I'm mad.  Oh.  You still need a 50?  50 bucks?  Nobody's going to back me on that one?  Oh, get a 50.  Oh, no.  Star Wars.  Who's giving you the 50?  Somebody from one of the music channels down the hall gave me 50 bucks, said, please give  this to Anthony.  Because they want to hear a radio show today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  We have a lot of fans here.  Trust me.  They're like, oh, God.  Here's this fucking 50.  Can you guys do something?  I count on you guys.  If the line at the Apple store is too long, the AT&T store might be a good second choice. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  Whatever it takes.  They get defective phones.  But they...  No.  They do.  No.  Yeah.  Somebody was telling me.  They're all sealed.  That's what I heard.  All the good phones go to the iPhone store, Apple store, and then the rest, they go, you  know what?  Eh.  A couple bugs in these.  Let's put them in the other stores.  Oh, my God.  I just want the fucking phone.  You ain't getting no phone.  What is the problem?  What is the problem?  The problem is that you're not doing what they want you to do.  Why is this...  You should have gone online like a good little boy. 
[00:29:30]  Why is this a problem?  And now you're being punished.  I should be able to go and make a purchase.  Go to the grocery store, scan your own fucking food, and you bag it.  That's true, man.  So we can fire everyone there.  That is true.  Go online, order your phone.  Home Depot's got that.  You go through, and you just...  Shut your mouth and be a good person.  Yeah.  I don't want to bag my own groceries.  No.  People who do that are the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet.  That is a major hassle.  A lot of people go, it's easier.  It's easier.  Really?  What's easier than standing there and letting two other people do it for you? 
[00:30:00]  It's easy if you get eggs, milk, butter.  But all of a sudden, you're holding a mango, and you're like, how the fuck do I pay for this?  Or even worse, you're standing behind a plumber with a mango trying to figure out how the fuck to do it.  You're like, all right, it's a fruit, I think, or is it a vegetable?  I don't know.  I had a guy try to tell me that that was technological progress.  It's like, no, it isn't.  That's just me doing the job.  Yeah, yeah.  You're making me work.  Yeah, if I walked up and magically, all of a sudden, I knew what I owed and it was in the bag.  Yeah.  If you're bagging your own groceries, you should give them a bill. 
[00:30:30]  Look, I just did a job.  You owe me now.  I work for you right now.  I'm taking this mango for free.  Sir, I'm sorry, sir.  We can't do that, sir.  I'm sorry.  I understand, sir.  I'm sorry, sir.  You're not on the list, sir.  I'll look again, sir.  They can never help, but they always understand.  Yeah.  I don't know why they transferred you to me, but I just, I understand.  Yeah, well, there's no reason to use that language.  Okay, goodbye, sir.  All right, you got the money?  You got the picture?  You got the fucking attitude? 
[00:31:00]  Well, ready to go.  All right.  Please just go over there and fail.  Get down there.  So I can enjoy the rest of my day.  Get down there and go get them.  Bring me back a phone.  That ain't happening.  Travis is just shaking his head like, it ain't happening.  You know, if you had pre-ordered, you could have picked it up at the store right after the show?  I don't want it after the show.  You could have walked in.  Did you hear the pause?  He just got upset in that moment.  I could go after the show.  I don't want to.  I have things to do after the show. 
[00:31:30]  Like what?  I want the phone now.  I want to be sitting in my heated pool drinking wine by 1120 today, sir.  Exactly.  Here, on Apple's website, what to bring.  You must bring the following with you when you visit the Apple retail store.  To buy something from them, you have to bring all this stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about I bring my fucking credit card and you give me a fucking phone?  Well, okay.  Credit card is one.  I'm not buying into this Apple culture. 
[00:32:00]  Sir, I'm sorry.  You can't use that language in this store.  I'm sorry, sir.  I ain't buying into the culture, man.  No way.  No way, no how.  All right, credit card is one.  A valid.  Not my phone, not my problem.  That's what I say.  That's right.  Government issued ID.  Yeah, right.  So, a license.  And your social security number.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  What is this garbage?  No way.  The kid in the background going crazy.  I bet her fist, I bet her fatalist burned, had her skoom padded little kid in the background 
[00:32:30]  fucking going crazy.  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  All right.  So, Evan's on his way?  He's on his way and I have zero faith.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Zero faith.  When we get back, we'll check in with Evan and Sam.  Sam's on the scene.  Sam, of course, is going with his little recorder.  I got to tell you that story about that girl I saw get arrested last night.  Oh, absolutely. 
[00:33:00]  Bill Burr has a great arrest story from last night.  Yeah.  Nice.  And other things.  She got bored with Billy Joel, they're saying today.  She got bored with him?  She said it was an age thing.  Oh, yeah.  Obviously.  That's like, how did they break up?  I think Billy's like, well, she didn't have a problem with it seven years ago.  Yeah.  Or five years ago, whatever it is.  You know what?  The more his life gets fucked up, the more I like him.  I was kind of into his music, but the second he started driving his car into people's houses  and cheating on supermodels, I fucking love him. 
[00:33:30]  He really is.  I just never got his old playing piano.  But this guy, he's a rock star.  Yeah, he is.  Billy Joel is a fucking rock star.  He lives the life.  What wasn't he doing, though, if he can't satisfy the old youngster?  She said that, now remember, I only read the first paragraph in news stories.  That's my new thing.  But what I learned is that she, when he's not on the road, he likes to tinker with his  antique motorcycle collection and sail around in his yachts. 
[00:34:00]  Sounds like a pretty good life.  Yeah.  Doesn't sound bad.  And she's bored.  She wants to go to the city and party and this and that, and he's 60 and she's 27.  Do you know what the word tinker?  That's a female word.  That's the word they use.  That is a female word for you're not paying attention to me.  You don't tinker on a motorcycle.  You're tinkering.  Yeah.  Like you're out there with this little fucking, like, what's that little, the triangle that  you play when you suck at music?  Tinkering is something unnecessary.  When you tinker on your motorcycle, you're just doing something that isn't necessary. 
[00:34:30]  When you're working on it, you're doing something that has to be done.  That's what you're doing.  You're working.  He's out there futzing around, tinkering on this thing.  Fuck you, lady.  Futzing is another word.  I'm not here fucking making my car run correctly.  Tinker with your hair.  No, in your mind, you're getting something done.  In their mind, it's, yeah, he's tinkering.  Uselessly tinkering.  Yeah.  Guys don't use that word, among other guys.  Among other guys.  Guys, we don't tinker.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  I'm going to flip this whole labor. 
[00:35:00]  Opie and Anthony for Friday with Bill Burr.  So what do we got?  We got Evan and Sam heading down to the Apple Store to get your iPhone.  To not get my phone.  Yeah, it ain't happening.  I hear you need all kinds of ID.  We'll see how far they get before they fail.  And they showed the line, by the way, which is building by the second.  Well, you guys were arguing forever.  You guys could have been first on line.  I thought it was the protests in Iran, and it turned out to be the Apple Store. 
[00:35:30]  Half of them are probably listeners who didn't know the phone came out today.  Like, oh, shit, that's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In line in front of you.  I re-end it.  Not going to happen.  Trying to help you.  Trying to help you.  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please.  We were talking about how over-the-top Malkovich's accent was in Rounders.  That's great.  Chick, chick, chick.  Give that man his money.  We might have Sam on the line. 
[00:36:00]  Or actually, Evan.  Evan.  Hey.  What's going on?  Outside of the Apple Store right now, there's quite a hubbub around here.  Pretty long lines.  Lots of press.  Uh-huh.  Trying to assess the situation, how I'm going to penetrate.  And it looks like they're just about to open the doors to the store now.  Ah.  I'm going to try to see my way in.  So nothing's going on.  Okay.  So when they open the store, I thought it was 24 hours. 
[00:36:30]  What the fuck?  Well, they're waiting to let people in.  I think it's 7, which is about now.  I think they're starting to let everybody in right now.  Okay.  I'll bet you $18 you don't get it.  I wouldn't take that bet because I wouldn't pay you because I know he's not going to be able  to get it for me.  I'm very upset.  About this.  Why should I need government documents to buy a phone?  That's where we're heading, my friend.  This is crazy.  This is all Bill Burr.  This is all everything Bill Burr said that I laughed at is all coming to fruition. 
[00:37:00]  And I am the only one here.  And these morons are down there standing in line helping them do it.  Yes.  Helping them.  Helping.  Evan, are you making your way toward the front door?  I'm standing in front of it right now.  We're not on line technically, but I'm going to try to circumvent that.  Oh, good luck with that.  The friggin' Apple Store Gestapo.  He's going to get beat up by somebody dressed like Boba Fett.  Yeah.  Boba Fett.  It's the same nerds.  The same nerds who stand outside to watch the next Star Wars. 
[00:37:30]  The Star Wars convention.  Yeah.  We'll line up to buy a fucking phone.  What is that noise?  They're cheering because they're opening the doors, right?  Oh, woo.  We can spend our good money on this.  You should have been down there interviewing those fucking losers.  What happened?  I'm going to let you guys go.  I'm just going to let people in.  I want to start trying to make my way inside.  All right.  Is Sam talking to people?  I think so.  He went somewhere.  I don't know where he was right now.  Yeah, he's probably talking to some people.  He's got good instincts.  Yeah, Sam's good that way.  I'm going to deal with another update. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Thank you, brother.  All right.  There goes Evan trying to get Anthony's new iPhone.  And it's not going to happen because apparently I have to go down myself.  Yeah.  If Obama wanted an iPhone, he would have to stand in line at the Apple Store.  We're just shark jocks.  You know something?  No, no, no, no.  There is one rule.  If he could do it through somebody else, and I know damn well someone like, let's say, Tom Cruise.  He's not standing on a fucking line at an Apple Store. 
[00:38:30]  He could fucking get somebody, a representative, to go down there and get the goddamn phone.  We're nowhere near Tom Cruise.  I'm just, I know.  That's just how it works in this world.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying that I should then be able to send a representative to get me my iPhone as long as I have the money.  Tom Cruise makes Hollywood blockbusters.  We tell dick jokes.  There's a drop-off there.  There are probably other people in the same category.  Yeah.  As us?  You think Mr. Down the Fucking Hall would stand in that line? 
[00:39:00]  Warren Beatty?  Warren Beatty?  I mean, if your star has fallen, they eventually come down to your level.  Like, I would say...  Who's coming down to our level?  Who would have to stand on that line?  Scott Baio?  Absolutely.  Scott Baio is standing on that line.  Absolutely.  You're right.  Willie Ames would be escorted away from the store.  He wouldn't have the money.  He wouldn't even have the money.  His credit card would be denied.  The lady who played...  He's on the StarTAC line.  That woman who played Marsha on the Brady Bunch?  Yes. 
[00:39:30]  That whole cast.  The whole cast of the Brady Bunch turned down.  Florence Henderson might have some sort of deal with some sort of kitchen product where she could get around it.  Yeah, she probably might be able to.  But who would you say is the biggest celebrity that wouldn't be able to do it?  Like, you've named plenty of...  Someone on the bubble?  Old.  Yeah.  Someone that's on the bubble.  That would be escorted away.  Jason Biggs.  Jason Biggs.  The last wave of young Hollywood people taking over.  I would say everyone from that movie American Pie.  What about the Dawson? 
[00:40:00]  You know what?  Outside the Kevin Smith show at Carnegie Hall, I saw one of the American Pie guys.  And no one recognized him.  So you made a really good point right there.  Yeah.  I forgot his name.  He was on our show because of that.  Was it a pie fucker?  Who fucked a pie?  I don't even remember anymore.  Jason Biggs.  Jason...  Oh, no, no, no.  I know that.  Because he was in...  No, it was the other guy.  He was in one of his movies.  It was the other guy who was like hitting on the mom.  Stifler?  Stifler.  Is that his name?  Would Stifler be able to... 
[00:40:30]  No, Stifler would be able to send the representative.  I've never really seen that movie.  That's how big that movie was.  I actually know the people in it.  I haven't seen it in years.  But one of the guys from American Pie was outside Carnegie Hall just waiting in line to  get in like everyone else.  Yeah.  And no one knew that it was one of the American Pie guys.  Yeah, yeah.  So.  Let's say hi to Tim in Alabama.  Tim.  Yes.  What's up, Tim?  What's up, man?  Hey.  My wife tried to get me an iPhone for Christmas.  She's on the account and she could not give me an iPhone because the account wasn't my 
[00:41:00]  name.  Uh-huh.  Yes, I understand it's Christmas.  I'm sorry, man.  We just can't.  Yeah.  No, we understand.  Because that's just how they do it.  They don't let us.  They.  Yeah, just awful.  Vague they.  Yeah, that guy.  Thanks, Danny.  The guy you just saw.  Yeah, that guy was outside the Kevin Smith show at Carnegie Hall and he went completely  unrecognized and he was in one of the biggest movies of the day there.  Travis said that's Eddie K. Thomas. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, he was.  And he's a good guy.  He's been on our show.  He was promoting some off-Broadway play when we were over at the XM facility.  Oh, what was he?  That Charlie Brown.  That Charlie Brown one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was just walking outside Carnegie Hall, not a hint of recognition.  And he was huge.  When that movie came out, he was, that whole cast was huge.  He wasn't one of the bigger ones.  I don't recognize him.  You really don't recognize him?  No.  Let's say hi to Jim in Florida.  Jim.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Good morning. 
[00:42:00]  Happy birthday, Bill.  Thank you.  Hey, this is on the lines that you were saying.  This is where everything's going.  And this is for Bill especially.  Apparently, in Denver, when you're buying a house, they're fingerprinting you.  You get fingerprinted for buying a house?  Apparently, that's what they're doing out there.  Shoot someone with it?  Come on.  Yeah.  No, they're going to barcode everybody.  Yeah.  And then they're going to fucking bankrupt the dollar.  And then whoever doesn't go along with it goes into those FEMA camps and gets processed. 
[00:42:30]  So they're going to solve the population problem.  He's just talking over you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You are.  All right.  Punch it out.  We were waiting.  So you get processed into a FEMA camp.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  I just know bankers run everything.  Apparently, yeah.  Illuminati.  Yeah.  Nerds.  Let's say hi to Mark in California.  Mark.  Hello, Bill.  Hi.  I heard on Wednesday nights either Colbertor 4 or The Daily Show. 
[00:43:00]  That's where I get my news.  That Obama is calling for the Federal Reserve to have complete control over the entire banking system in the United States.  There you go.  There's your liberal.  There it is.  They're all the same guy, dude.  They're all the same fucking guy.  You know what I was thinking the other day in 2004 when Kerry ran against Bush?  You had two white guys, both from Yale, both who would remember the Skulls.  Go ahead.  Take your pick. 
[00:43:30]  Who do you like?  Spin the wheel.  Do we really have a choice in this kind of scene?  You don't.  Primetime Sam Roberts?  I'm looking at the Apple Store.  They're interviewing people.  No, there's no primetime Sam Roberts there.  There's primetime.  Let's say hi to Anthony in the Bronx.  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Bill, I'm a huge fan, by the way.  Thank you.  So I was just at the Apple Store in the Westchester Mall, and I'm a registered user under my mother's account.  I was there for two hours before they came out and said, oh, no, no. 
[00:44:00]  She has to be here in person with her ID and everything.  You can't be here even though you're a registered user under her account.  Oh, my God.  Why do they make it so hard to buy their product?  I don't get it.  I don't either.  I don't understand.  You must have two forms of ID for us to help you.  I can't do the accent.  Where are your papers?  It's got alligator blood.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, when I was in Utah, they got that whole new thing. 
[00:44:30]  If you want to skip the security line, if you allow them to scan your retina and fingerprint you.  I'm telling you, they're getting the barcode on everybody.  Yeah.  That's what it's all about.  What's up, B-Rock?  All right, Dina.  You can see Sam and Evan on Channel 5.  Where?  Evan's right there.  Evan's not in the fucking store.  No, here's the problem.  There's a whole group to the right that goes down 59th that they're letting in right now.  Yeah.  There's a second group, I guess that's 60th.  Right.  And that's where Evan is.  So he has to wait for that first group.  Oh, come on.  So he's not even close to getting in the store, Ant. 
[00:45:00]  He's not even close to getting hilped.  Look at this son of a bitch bragging.  Let's call Evan, though.  I bet you he's going to lie and say he's in the store as we're watching him on TV.  Do you see what these idiots are doing?  Look at him.  He's shining, Sam.  Sam's on live TV right now.  He's behind the guy's head right there.  Right.  There you go.  There's Sam again.  If they move the camera, you get to see Sam on Channel 5 here in New York.  There's Evan on Channel 11.  There's Evan on Channel 11.  Look at that.  Look at everybody.  There's a guy dressed as an iPhone. 
[00:45:30]  Have Sam walk toward this report and go, excuse me, I'm here to get Anthony a iPhone.  What do I have to do?  Where is an out-of-control cab when you need one?  Hey, what if you don't want to buy an iPhone?  You just want to go in there and buy another one of their products.  Do you still have to stand in that stupid line?  Yeah, you're fucked.  Like, I just want one of those cords so I can charge my iPod to my...  Totally screwed.  No, I bet you they're allowed in.  Ain't going to happen.  They probably have some weird, like...  You want to bet $18? 
[00:46:00]  All the money I have in my pocket?  I went down there once to get something other than what the line was for.  Yeah, right.  Look at...  See?  Look at the video feature.  Look at that.  I can't have that today.  I can't have that.  Not allowed.  Uh-huh.  Ooh.  Stupid Evan.  Where's Sam?  You going to drink yourself to sleep tonight because you don't have the iPod, Anthony?  What's the difference? 
[00:46:30]  iPod, no iPod.  Friday.  Thursday.  Monday.  Just drink myself to sleep.  Oh, we're watching...  Where is it?  Channel 11?  Yeah.  Is that where they're doing the big report from?  Hey, Anthony, when are we going shooting?  That's a lot of people.  Now that I'm here for a couple of weeks.  The second the fucking weather is nice enough to go out to Calverton, I don't want to go to an indoor range.  You want to shoot in the rain, you pussy?  Nah, fucking...  You want to rust up your guns, Johnny?  Nasty.  Yeah.  Just laying in the mud.  I don't want to do that. 
[00:47:00]  What am I?  Soldier boy.  Oh, Christ.  He's never getting in there, even.  Evan's not even in a line.  Like, Evan's just hanging out where people hang out.  Yeah.  Well, we'll check in with the iPhone problem.  He's milling.  He's milling.  He's milling.  Look at him.  Look at Evan.  Just milling behind that guy.  He's not even in a line.  Look at him just standing there.  No, last year when I sat on that line, where Evan is right now, that's just where people hang out if they want to watch what's going on. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  Oh, it's not even in the line?  No, no, no.  He's not at all.  You can get in the line, which is to the right, which probably has hundreds of people in it.  Yeah.  He's just hanging out.  Dude, he should have just gone to breakfast and gotten a lap dance somewhere and come back and been like...  Come back, guy.  I lost your money.  Yeah, I lost your money.  You couldn't get one.  I'm sorry.  Yes, I understand, sir.  Well, I would be upset, too.  We understand.  But they don't want us selling the phones.  They don't let...  9-11.  Because of 9-11.  They don't let us. 
[00:48:00]  Can I talk to they?  What?  No.  They don't come out.  Ma'am, is there any way you can turn the intercom down?  No.  There's nothing we can do.  Really?  They just installed it at full blast on this airplane?  They installed it on 10?  Yeah, there's nothing we can do.  Holy shit.  There's nothing we can do.  Yeah, there's nothing.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm sorry.  You're not allowed to stand here, sir.  Very sorry.  Because they want us to keep this area clear.  All right, Evan, what's going on?  It's Sam.  Here's Evan. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, Sam.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Evan.  Hey, what's going on, man?  I'm trying to work who appears to be organizing this event.  And it's, I shouldn't say one way or the other, but I think I might be able to squeeze in within the next few minutes.  We saw you on Channel 11 News just loitering.  Well, yeah.  I'm waiting for my opportunity.  You're waiting for your opportunity? 
[00:49:00]  To what?  Yeah.  To get in?  To run at the door?  I don't think that would be a wise choice.  But you said that you're waiting for something, but we just saw you loitering.  You were just milling about.  Yeah.  Why are people applauding?  What are they applauding?  Yeah.  What is the sound we're hearing?  They're applauding people purchasing the phone.  People that have successfully purchased the phone.  Can you believe what fucking idiots they are? 
[00:49:30]  It's like, does some chick hold, is she holding it between her titties right now?  They're seeing breasts for the first time in their life.  Just walking out the store with the new iPhone and they're applauding it.  Wow.  You wait until they start sticking microchips in people.  Those same fucking idiots are going to go down there, excited with the new technology.  They want to be first online to have the microchip installed.  Yeah, embedded in their fucking forehead.  Come out cheering, and then they shut them off.  I like it.  It's easier.  It's way more convenient.  This is safe and easy and convenient for me now to make calls. 
[00:50:00]  I love that people always know where I am.  It's got a GPS in it, so I'm safer.  From the terrorists.  Evan, they're applauding again.  What's that?  Someone else walking.  It's like the end of a marathon.  They're applauding people entering and leaving.  They're applauding.  Don't these people have to go to work today?  Anthony, that's that part of the marathon where it's just like the winner already crossed two hours. 
[00:50:30]  It's applauding people for finishing.  These are the courageous people.  The ones that walked the whole marathon.  And your dad who had ass cancer like six months ago.  Exactly.  He's the one getting the applause.  All right, Evan.  You're pretty much tinkering right now.  We need you to...  Tinkering.  Get in there.  Oh, I think you might be good.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  Funny if they start booing him.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  He just jumped out of the back of a group of press people, and he's just going to slide in with them.  Oh, oh.  Oh, he's walking in with press people?  God, Evan's pretty smart.  All right.  If he gets through, I'm going to applaud.  That's just the first line of defense, though.  He's never going to get the phone.  Oh, hang on one sec.  Oh, okay.  Probably trouble.  All right, yeah, we're going in.  Oh, okay.  I don't know if we'll have service down in the store, then.  Yeah, you should.  Are you inside?  Oh. 
[00:51:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, we got off.  Evan got stopped.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  But he's getting applauded anyway.  Yeah, he got stopped.  So we're back outside.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  He didn't make it.  He almost made it.  No, we got stopped.  Like fucking Midnight Express.  Get Evan back on the phone.  Why can't he just say that, you know, he's part of the Open Antif show?  They're hyping the phone.  Yeah, we're.  They only fucking live broadcast right now. 
[00:52:00]  What the fuck is this?  We're a live broadcast.  Television, apparently.  Just television?  Say if you bought a video iPhone, you'd be able to videotape it.  Pricks.  I feel pretty positive about this.  I feel it's going to happen.  But you just got stopped.  You just got thrown out.  Well, I'm on the other side of the road now. 
[00:52:30]  It's like a fucking, it's like a mongoloid trying to get into Studio 54.  It's just not happening.  It's just not happening.  Get Sam on the phone.  More people are coming in.  Yeah, I know.  More people that don't include Evan.  That's some great on-the-street reporting there, Evan.  People are going into a store.  They're going in.  Now they're leaving.  Why not?  Product they've purchased. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, why don't you give them that entire 500 to do a smash and grab?  All right, hold on.  We got an anonymous person checking in.  Anonymous.  Hey, yeah.  I work at the Apple Store.  We get in on the phone.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, man.  No problem.  Really?  Yeah, no problem at all.  Just, you know, do a little bit under the table and we got it.  No problem.  I'm sure, yeah.  You sound like somebody that works down there.  I do.  How come I don't hear a big commotion behind you? 
[00:53:30]  I'm in the storage at the back.  Shut up.  Man, I got it for you.  I'll give you one for free.  Okay, come up to the studio with it.  All right, I will.  All right, thanks.  I'll bring a whole box.  All right, a whole box.  I'll bring a whole box.  What an asshole.  I'll bring a whole box.  Sam, Evan, who we got?  Hi, Evan.  What's up?  Ah, great.  So where are we at now?  Go out, waiting, right inside the front door, waiting for permission after. 
[00:54:00]  He's giving up hope.  When people walk out.  I'm not giving up at all.  What?  Just take patience.  Take off.  Patience?  Yeah, it's called standing in line.  I don't have patience.  I have privilege.  I don't need patience.  Again, it's impossible.  While you're hanging out, when people are walking out with their iPhones, remind them about the app.  Remind them about the SiriusXM app with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  Say, Opie and Anthony are available live on the iPhone.  I'll tell every single one that comes out.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  All right.  iPhone.  I'm going to give it back to Sam because I want to say a big moment for my opportunity to enter.  All right.  All right.  This is Sam.  Hello?  Hey, Sam.  Are you getting any audio from some of these people?  No, because we've been in the press section, not in the public section. 
[00:55:00]  Ah, I gotcha.  So what does it look like?  What does it look like?  What do we get?  I mean, the line's long.  It's not as long as they would have liked because there is a lot of empty barricade space.  Uh-huh.  But it is so long.  Like, it's going to be a few hours if we jump on the line.  Like, a couple hours.  Jesus.  But there's a lot of media getting interviews with people.  For a phone, which you already have.  It's like a Hollywood event, really.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Listen to the applauding. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, guys.  So exciting here at the Apple store.  Such a sarcastic ass.  I can't believe they are applauding people.  That's bizarre.  People that just bought a phone.  Yeah.  And they're applauding them.  And those people waited online all night.  You know that.  Yeah.  And it's leading to people exiting the store and celebrating with their phones and showing  them to all the press who's just clapping along with them.  They're holding them up and like, woo, look what I got.  Yes.  I purchased this. 
[00:56:00]  Why are there cameras in front of, like, Dwayne Reed when someone walks out with their underwear?  Like a package of Fruit of the Looms.  Can you imagine if people applauded you after you bought your tampons?  People outside laughing and wooing.  Yeah.  Your enema.  Just holding up an enema.  Fleet enema right there in your hand.  All right, Sam.  This is exciting.  I got to tell you.  Yeah.  See, we're part of the whole media frenzy that's going on with the release of the iPhone.  I hate to interrupt, but it looks like we're going in.  No. 
[00:56:30]  That's impossible.  We're going down the stairs, so hopefully I won't lose service.  If I do, I'll record everything, and we'll get it in post.  Very good.  Oh, that's a good idea.  All right.  He's going.  They're in.  Very echoey.  I hear it.  Yep, yep.  I still hear you.  Going down the big circular glass stairs.  Hey, he's going downstairs, everybody.  Yeah.  Downstairs.  Sales Associates just directed Evan on where he could go to get a phone. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  We're one step closer to rejection.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Another sales associate just looked at Evan and said, oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There's no reason to be sorry.  I'm going in.  What's the sorry about?  What happened?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Oh, there's a problem.  Oh, Jesus.  I knew it.  I don't think I'm getting it.  All right.  We are getting online.  Evan is getting online. 
[00:57:30]  Okay.  But why is he sorry?  Hang on one second.  I'll put Evan on so he can give the recap of that conversation.  Fantastic.  All right.  We're in, and now we're on another line inside.  Why did a guy say he was sorry?  What guy?  I thought someone told you, I'm sorry.  Oh, I tried to cut this line, but that couldn't.  Oh, okay.  How long is this line?  It's relatively short.  This is like a checkout line.  All right.  You got the phone in your hand? 
[00:58:00]  No, I don't.  I don't think they keep them behind the counter.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  They sure as shit ain't stacking those out there like a can of beans.  Big pyramid of iPhones.  So I'm going to go there.  I'm going to answer the phone.  But getting it onto your account, I might have to need some extra information at some  point.  Oh, Christ.  I'm going to flash the cash.  I'm going to flash the paper ad and the picture.  Yes.  See how that does.  That's all you need to do.  And it should fucking, that should go over. 
[00:58:30]  How many people are in the store right now?  Uh, I mean, I think there's probably about a hundred people in here, but it's a pretty  big floor, so it's not stuff.  Yeah, all right.  Get Sam back on the phone.  I think Sam needs to start some kind of iPhone chant.  Okay, sure.  Not before he gets it.  Hello?  Sam, can you start some like maybe iPhone chant to get the excitement going in the store?  Okay, hang on one second.  Think of something good.  For the iPhone, everybody!  iPhone! 
[00:59:00]  iPhone!  iPhone!  iPhone!  iPhone!  It just looks like just me and Evan on that one.  On that one.  On that one.  Maybe because you need something better than just chanting iPhone.  Okay.  You should have told them whoever chants at the loudest gets to bypass the line.  Okay.  Throw them out so fast.  Well, how about if we just start seeing if we can get people to chant 3GS?  Okay, yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[00:59:30]  That's a good one.  Yeah, let's try that, Sam.  That's a good one.  Let's get the excitement level up.  All right.  We're here to get a new iPhone, everybody!  3GS!  3GS!  3GS!  3...  No, that one was just me and Evan as well.  Yeah, we're not being creative enough.  What, did you go to a new location where they don't realize you're the nerd who yelled it  two minutes ago?  I don't think they care.  Wait, no, we got to, like, um, hmm...  This line's too long.  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[01:00:00]  How about a holy shit chant?  I'm afraid some of those chants would jeopardize Anthony's shot at getting an iPhone.  That's why we want to do it, Sam.  Yes.  Yeah, no.  I mean...  How about iPhone...  How about iPhone rules?  Holy shit.  iPhone rules.  Holy shit.  Come on, Sam.  You just got to get someone who just got the phone.  Sam has no problem with it.  All right, let's go, Sam. 
[01:00:30]  All right, they're champ now.  iPhone rules.  Holy shit.  iPhone rules.  Holy shit.  No, just dirty looks on that one.  No excitement.  Yeah, that was...  Yeah, yeah.  That was a bad one.  Bill, you got one?  Maybe that ties in, like, corporate American men.  Well, how about when a female comes walking out, you just...  Oh, hang on.  We got a camera on us.  Oh.  Hang on.  Oh, we're going to do an interview for CNBC.  Oh.  Hold on one sec. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, nice.  Cool.  Make sure you mention the Opie and Anthony app.  We're getting the iPhone 3GS.  We love iPhone and Apple products.  3GS.  We love it because it's got picture messaging soon.  And hopefully better reception, maybe.  3GS all the way.  Hopefully we'll spend $500 to $700 today.  On just Apple products.  On just Apple products.  This is your first one. 
[01:01:30]  I'm going from the BlackBerry to the 3GS because I'm tired of all my hauls going through.  BlackBerry to Apple.  Well, I went on all these Internet sites and they all told me that Apple has a touch screen.  And so on the iPhone, you can actually touch the screen to text.  And so that was the draw for me.  I'm sick of BlackBerry.  BlackBerry is yesterday.  And iPhone is now. 
[01:02:00]  3GS.  3GS.  3GS.  3GS.  I'm tired of my hauls going through.  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  What's the name?  His name is Evan.  Oh, God.  This is great.  And tell him why Evan's there, Sam.  Evan is there to buy Anthony Cumia an iPhone from the Opie and Anthony show.  She looked at me funny. 
[01:02:30]  Of course she did.  Are you guys just blackballed with everybody at this?  Yes.  People hate us.  I have no idea.  It's wonderful.  It's a wonderful fucking way to go through life.  Always a scourge of society.  How long would it take you guys to just reverse?  How long would you have to behave yourself?  Opie would cure cancer.  I could cure AIDS.  I would have to.  Peace on earth.  Clean the air.  I would have to go into the witness protection program and change my look and my name.  Yeah.  Wow.  Sam.  Yeah.  How about another iPhone? 
[01:03:00]  Wait, what?  iPhone rules?  Holy shit.  I would say if a woman comes out who just bought one, just chant, put it in your cunt.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You know what?  I like it.  We're actually, we're next on line.  So we're about to approach the cast.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  This is what we're waiting for.  This is the big moment.  How was the big interview with CNBC?  It went great.  I hope everybody's tuned into CNBC after the Opie and Anthony show goes off, of course,  and looks for me and Evan on the big screen. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, that would rule after you used you.  I liked how you said you're tired of your calls going through.  We're getting a very good idea for a chant, Sam.  Could you chant, I'm here, I'm queer.  I want my iPhone.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's see if this works.  Okay.  All right.  iPhones, everybody.  Evan, chant with me.  We're here.  We're queer.  We want our iPhone.  We're here.  We're queer. 
[01:04:00]  We want our iPhone.  No, nobody was down with that.  How about you chant, I'm a nerd.  I'm a nerd.  I'm a nerd.  And then that's it, huh?  And then that's it, huh?  How about we are nerds?  Yeah.  Try to get him to go with them.  All right.  That's good.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see if they'll get behind me on that one then.  All right.  Evan, let's do another chant and see if we can get them going. 
[01:04:30]  One, two, three.  We are nerds.  We are nerds.  We are nerds.  We're out of it.  Yeah, we're just getting one phone together.  Oh, here it comes.  Oh, we're doing it.  It must be all the chanting.  Yeah.  Sam, I got one more chant after you get the phone.  They won't get the phone.  Hopefully.  They will not get the phone.  The chant is very easy.  Pussy yuck.  Pussy yuck. 
[01:05:00]  Okay.  All right.  Somebody has just handed the sales associate an iPhone.  Okay.  And Evan is getting the handshake.  And he said, what's your name?  And he said, Evan.  So it looks like he's pitching right now exactly what's going on here.  I don't want to get too close as to disrupt the sales process.  He better say the O&A show. 
[01:05:30]  He's reaching into the pocket.  He's got his hand on the daily news ad.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jesus.  It's not good.  He's ready to pull out the big button.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  All right.  He just showed him his serious ID card.  He pointed at me.  He pointed at me.  Oh, that's great.  I waved. 
[01:06:00]  I got his hand on his shoulder.  All right.  Evan, what's the update?  He's going to work it out with his manager about buying it on behalf of Anthony.  Oh.  All right.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  All right.  See, we should have money on this, too.  This would have really ratcheted up the excitement.  Sam, very good news.  We have time to do another chant.  Kevin from Connecticut.  You're going to do Kevin from Connecticut's chant.  It's very easy. 
[01:06:30]  Just yell, I'm Sam Roberts, and I want to recruit you.  Maybe after we get the iPhone, I could yell that in celebration.  Yeah, yeah.  That sounds more like a celebratory thing.  Or do we like pussy yuck, pussy yuck.  I like pussy yuck.  I say you do both back-to-back, clothes with pussy yuck, and start with the recruit you.  Yeah, I think that's a big clue.  The pussy yuck, ew, vagina.  Ew, vagina. 
[01:07:00]  What would you choose?  Yeah.  Okay.  I think after we're going to...  Evan is talking to a manager.  Oh.  We can get this iPhone.  Okay.  I'll yell out the recruit you thing, and then the...  Talk to the manager.  Here we go.  Another chant that I want to say out loud.  Here we go.  All right.  Uh-oh.  A lot of head shaking happening.  Oh, that's never good.  Oh, shit.  But the sales associate is talking to his manager.  It looks like he's justifying Evan's case.  Ah.  So maybe...  He's got like a lawyer there. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  This is...  Evan appears to be scanning through his pea brain trying to figure out excuses.  Oh, shit.  The iPhone is literally 12 inches away from Evan's hand.  Just grab it and run.  Grab it and run.  It's so close.  It's so far.  They're teasing you.  He tasks me.  Sam, threaten them.  Go, if you don't give us that iPhone, I'm going to get naked in your store. 
[01:08:00]  And just start pulling your clothes off.  I think Evan is doing a wise thing.  And the manager just walked away because it appears that Evan is letting them know that  we're live on the radio trying to get an iPhone.  Oh, nice.  Oh, no.  You know what?  I think it's time for another chant.  Because it'll get to the point they just want you out of the fucking store.  So they'll go, all right, here.  Take the fucking iPhone.  Which one do you want to do?  Well, you've got to stay away from something vulgar because then they can just be...  True, true.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they've got a reason. 
[01:08:30]  The press agent just came over to talk to Evan now.  Oh, shit.  That's not good because they have nothing to do with the sale of the phone.  Big problem now.  You're going to have to leave.  You're going to have to leave the store.  Did you get your interview?  You got everything you need?  Dude, if you somehow had a female listener go in there and buy the phone and then you  had other listeners chant, put it in your cunt when she left and she actually did it.  Fantastic.  Oh, the glow coming out of her vagina.  That would have been...  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  That would be a lot of hits.  What's going on?  I'm going to get an update on that.  What's happening here?  They seem to be mulling it over between them.  Okay.  They're mulling it over.  I'm mulling it over.  He's got a 32 gig iPhone in his hand, but the manager...  It says manager right on her t-shirt.  It's talking to Evan.  We're on the radio, miss.  I'm not saying anything derogatory.  She didn't like that I was talking about her t-shirt. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, oh.  Well...  What was on her t-shirt?  Tell her to press the fucking app, the Sirius app, and listen to the guy that wants the phone.  Looks like they're pointing and clicking on their credit card machine, Dealey, that they,  you know, ring you up before you get to the cash register.  Uh-huh.  They're pointing at something.  They're talking about pricing.  Uh-huh.  Because I heard him say that's before taxes.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[01:10:00]  Oh.  I don't know if Evan is doing some of his bargaining here.  Bargaining?  There's no...  This isn't Bangladesh.  Oh, no.  What's the matter?  The lady just said very clearly, like, so, like, as if Evan was retarded with her hands and everything,  I could clearly hear her say, he has to be here, he has to sign for it,  and made a motion of her hand as if she was signing a paper.  That's when you've got to be, I have power of attorney over Anthony's estate. 
[01:10:30]  Woo!  What?  Tell him...  Hang on one second.  Okay.  I'll tell Evan.  Tell him what if he was buying it for Obama.  Anthony said you have power of attorney.  Over Anthony's estate.  Unfortunately, we do need that account holder here.  What if, ask her, what if Obama, what if Obama needed a phone?  Would he have to come down there?  Ask, ask the woman if she'll come on the...  Ask if, what if Obama needed a phone?  What if Obama needed a phone? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, she, she was unhappy with that question.  Why?  But it's a legitimate question.  Sam, ask her if she'll go on the radio and, uh, and talk to the guy whose phone this is for.  Okay.  Miss, I don't mean to bother you.  Anthony's on the radio right now.  Would you mind coming on the radio for a second?  Yeah, I understand.  But he's stopped.  Oh.  You're a party.  I'm too.  Oh, my goodness.  No, she's not interested in that.  Ah.  But she understands.  I told you.  Yeah.  I understand.  She backed away and said, you need to stop. 
[01:11:30]  And Dara's already told you to stop.  Oh, boy.  Because I...  How about...  That's, uh, that's no good, huh?  All right, you need to...  That's no good, huh?  Sam, you need to chant, I won't leave.  I won't leave.  I won't leave.  I think, I think Evan has something.  Oh, okay.  I can only get it on the off-contract front.  No.  I should stick by the nine.  No, what does that mean?  It means he pays $700, and then you get it without a contract, and then you take that 
[01:12:00]  phone later and have to activate it in an AT&T store or something.  No, that's insanity.  So, basically, you pay the $700, and then you get what you would have gotten for $500,  except later.  No, I don't want that.  I mean...  Well, the next chance should be, what a rip-off.  What a rip-off.  This is amazing.  You could buy a car easier.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Evan, what's our plan, then?  I hope you have a credit card. 
[01:12:30]  You wouldn't mind putting the difference on.  No, I'm not paying $700 for a phone.  Sam.  You don't want to pay $700 for the same phone that...  Well, once you activate it, you'll get the money back.  Oh, he said once you activate it, you'll get the money back.  Yeah, but then you still have to go to an AT&T store.  No, I don't want to do that.  Sam, start a sit-in.  All right.  Evan, they want us to start a sit-in.  So, I guess we're sitting in, then? 
[01:13:00]  I didn't realize I was going to end up getting arrested in my attempts for an iPhone.  Yes, exactly.  Start a hunger strike.  You're all in, Sam, until you get that fucking iPhone.  Wow, this is not good press for you.  I hear more applause from people that actually are getting them.  Tell them that they're getting these things, and they are clapping for them. 
[01:13:30]  Tell them that they're a big sponsor on our radio show.  Evan, did you point out the apps to them?  Dude, what's the apps?  That's because they're all so good about the apps.  You know, Candace has...  The manager has very much left, and I have no idea where she is.  She's hidden or something.  Well, Sam, well, if she wants to hide, we've got a new chant for you from Candace.  Are you ready for this one?  Yeah.  Let's see what kind of balls Sam's got. 
[01:14:00]  Just start a chant that says,  Bait and switch!  Bait and switch!  Hang on.  Evan, stand right there and start a chant and just start screaming,  Bait and switch, Bait and switch.  Oh, Evan said he doesn't want to do that until he's exhausted all options.  All options are exhausted.  I think they're exhausted, too. 
[01:14:30]  Right now, he's choosing the option of standing with nobody talking to him.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go, Evan.  Just tell him.  You guys bring some liquid ass into the store?  Liquid ass.  Evan's talking to the manager again.  Okay.  Yeah.  At the manager.  And I think he's trying to use some of those other options he was talking about.  Exhausting. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Just exhausting all options now.  It's over, Johnny.  Not according to Evan.  He's still optimistic.  He's a retard.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  The press is still outside, right?  The press is still outside.  You know that if you cause a commotion when you're leaving the Apple store, they're going  to want to know why you're causing a commotion.  And then you kind of explain, you know, what happened in there. 
[01:15:30]  I wanted to buy the phone.  I couldn't buy one.  I couldn't.  I had, you know, I wanted to buy it for somebody else.  They're in a wheelchair.  They can't make it down here today.  It's impossible for them to make it down here.  Make a big to-do.  Right.  So, you know, obviously they're making it very hard for the handicapped to get the  iPhone 3G.  Yeah.  Oh, they'll report that.  Oh, yeah.  They will.  They'll be all over that.  Okay.  Then how about, Evan just said that what he's gotten from exhausting all his options is  the promise that we could leave and then come back and we don't have to wait on the line. 
[01:16:00]  So I think the only alternative here is to leave the store and start maybe some kind  of like, maybe some kind of bait and switch chant in front of the press.  But then, wait, you could come down there.  What, you mean I can go down and cut the line?  I'm assuming Evan and me would have to quit here.  Right, right.  I would assume.  Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.  Jesus. 
[01:16:30]  Just give him the fucking phone.  They can't.  Isn't that amazing?  I'm sorry, sir.  We're not on the line.  I understand.  I understand.  I want to fucking go to that corporate training to see just when they start telling you that  how that's done.  Just always tell them you understand.  I understand.  I understand, sir.  Sam, where are we at?  Are they asking us to leave, Evan?  No.  That's recording.  So what are we doing here?  All right.  Would you mind staying here?  I'll run back.  Maybe let me cab and pick up the additional money. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  Evan's idea is for me to stay here.  Right.  He runs back to the studio.  Yeah.  He gets the money from you.  Yeah.  And then he comes back here.  And then he buys the phone.  And then he gives you the phone.  And then you come back here after the show and activate it.  See, look, no, I'm not buying the phone for $700 and activating it.  And even if I get my money back, I'm not going there after the show.  The whole goal is for me to not go there after the show. 
[01:17:30]  That's why you're there now.  But that seems to be futile.  Just leave and cause a little ruckus in front of the press.  Okay.  All right.  We're going to get out of here, Evan.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We're aging the...  Bring back my money, bitch.  And, Evan, when you get up to the top there in front of all the press outside, I need you  to start chanting as loud as you can, bait and switch.  Just be flabbergasted. 
[01:18:00]  And be flabbergasted.  And if the press wants to interview you, make some stuff up.  Yeah, brief them on the way up about the whole, you know, I'm trying to buy an iPhone for  a handicapped friend that can't get down here, and they're telling me I can't.  Oh, no.  What?  I'll be answering, I have bad news.  There's only three cameras left outside.  Oh, of course.  Evan, you've failed on every corner.  He says we haven't failed yet. 
[01:18:30]  What are we doing next, Evan?  Evan, we're going to pick up that for the rest of that month.  Are we?  He doesn't understand the concept of you don't want to come back and activate the phone  later.  He doesn't understand that?  No.  I don't want that.  Oh, boy.  Evan.  I hear Bobo's here.  Maybe Bobo can go down to the Apple store and help me out. 
[01:19:00]  I need an iPhone.  All right.  Are you guys out of the store?  Yeah, now we're out of the store.  Oh.  Yeah.  This is terrible.  All right.  Well, there you go.  We walked you through it.  It's easy to get the new iPhone.  Yeah, apparently.  We don't have one.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Sam.  Coming back empty-handed.  All right.  All right.  Come on back.  All right.  Thanks, guys. 
[01:19:30]  Thanks for the attempt.  There goes Sam and Abby.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  I like Kevin's.  Huh?  I like what Kevin says.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Good evening.  Good evening.  What's up?  Have Sam go back and pull the race car.  You won't give me the phone because I'm a black man.  That would be great.  That would be fun.  They would wait on him hand and foot.  We did everything we could.  Yep.  All right.  We're going to take a break and get into some other things. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Oh, the arrest story.  Yeah.  You're just exhausted now, right, Bill?  Well, I mean, I also got two and a half hours sleep last night.  Yeah, I hear you.  At some point, you know.  Once put it in your cunt didn't go through.  Right.  I just, I really wanted to hear that.  If you could just somehow.  Would have been good.  And she did it.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, the press would just be like, what the fuck?  Just makes no sense.  That woman put it up her vagina.  All right.  We'll take a quick break and we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony and Bill Burr. 
[01:20:30]  That's amazing.  Opie and Anthony, during the break, Danny is showing us a video of Britney Spears.  I guess a fan jumped on stage and Britney Spears completely freaks out and loses her mind.  There's no real audio, but the video itself is priceless because you can just see the fear.  Yeah.  She's scared shitless.  She is scared shitless.  Or something.  She created a new dance move.  Yeah.  She did this shake.  I think I'm going to get murdered.  It was about six weeks ago, I guess. 
[01:21:00]  Maybe two months ago.  And when it first came out, it was the best thing I'd ever seen in my life because she  is so legitimately afraid for her life.  Like, you could see it in her face.  She's shaking.  Her hand does this little shaky move.  And she tilts to the left and puts her hand like...  And starts moving backwards.  It's like the electric slide and the Harlem shake combined.  It's on YouTube.  It's up to like a million views already.  I'm going to watch this over and over again.  What is it?  Crazy?  Yeah.  If you just type in like a Britney Spears fan on stage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'll get it.  Yeah.  You'll find it.  And the kid looks like he's completely harmless, by the way. 
[01:21:30]  No.  You see a security guy come out to the side, too, at the last minute.  Like, look at this guy run in.  That guy.  Oh, that guy.  That big black guy is ready to fuck that guy's world up.  Obviously, he took care of the situation because then she pauses and then goes back into dancing.  He gets tackled, I think.  I think he gets tackled.  Yeah, tackled right back into the audience.  His head disappears pretty quickly from the picture.  That's got to be hard for her to literally think you're going to get murdered and then you have to go back to dancing.  Doing some stupid dancing.  Okay, where were we?  In her hot pants cop outfit. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I know.  All right.  Oh, Bill.  Speaking of dumb whores.  Yeah.  You saw a nice little scene last night?  Oh, it was great.  Last night I was coming out of the comedy cellar and all of a sudden somebody comes running up to me who looked like an EMT with his white shirt.  I'm going, freeze, freeze.  And it was Keith the cop, right?  You don't like the white shirt?  No, I love it.  I love it.  But I've never seen a cop with the white shirt.  Like, evidently he's got enough credits, enough TV credits where he could just be hanging down to the precinct.  He's a big man on campus now.  Yeah.  He likes the action out on the street, right? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, he likes still being out on the street.  And we were literally talking about that.  And he goes, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  And I'm like, nothing.  Because I totally forgot that I had to do this shit at six in the morning.  So I'm like, oh, I'm just hanging out.  And he goes, yeah, we should, you know, just whatever.  So I'm just kind of hanging out with him.  And then he literally gets a call.  And it's two fucking bars down.  Oh, shit.  And I walked down there and there was some girl in there.  I guess she was talking to some guy and something happened.  And she punched the guy she was talking to and then dumped a full beer on another guy who had nothing to do with anything. 
[01:23:00]  Now, right there is a guy.  You're getting into a fight.  Yeah.  You're going to get stomped by the dude or maybe you start to win and then the bouncers stomp you.  So she gets out of that ass kicking because she has a vagina.  She screams at the bouncer.  And the bouncers, you know, take her out of the club.  And she gets mad.  And she dumps all her belongings for some reason out onto the sidewalk like a purse, hairbrush, flip flops.  Drunk.  And that's when we showed up.  She was like gathering her shit up.  And the second they showed up, she started flipping. 
[01:23:30]  Started walking towards a cab.  And then she just turned around and took an umbrella and threw it at the cops.  Keith and the other dude.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Then she thought she was just going to turn around and get into a cab.  Yeah.  I'm leaving now.  Oh, yeah.  I have a vagina.  That's what you can do.  I can just throw.  What happens to us if we throw an umbrella at the cops?  It wouldn't even have got to Keith the cop.  We would have got a nice stomping.  Wouldn't even have gotten that.  You would have got stomped by the fucking bouncers.  The bouncers.  You'd have been a bloody mess. 
[01:24:00]  Thrown on the sidewalk bloody.  Right.  So then she turns around to the cab like, well, I guess I made my point.  And then they walk over and grab her.  And immediately I'm totally excited.  And I realized how much I fucking can't stand women.  I was just like, yes, arrest her.  Show no mercy.  Right.  And then they put her up against the wall.  And she tried the crying.  She tried the I'm the baby.  You're bruising me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That old gag.  Oh, then they ended up putting her in the car.  She kicked her heels off.  And she's literally as hard as you possibly could is kicking the side of the window in there. 
[01:24:30]  Like on Cops.  When you watch Cops, the lunatic chicks are always banging their head or their fucking feet against the window.  Like a cat using its back legs.  Literally.  Up against the window.  And I literally said to one of the cops, I go, be honest, dude.  I go, if I did something like that, I didn't even finish it.  He goes, oh, yeah, dude.  He goes, your face would be in the pavement.  That's definitely a double standard.  That's great.  Unless you're an ugly woman.  Then they kind of consider you a guy.  They're going on them in this chick on the video. 
[01:25:00]  We're watching something.  I guess she's going to take a sobriety test.  She thinks she's leaving.  She's just trying to leave the room.  Yeah.  But this cop is like, you can't leave.  You're under arrest.  She's like, no, I'll just go home now.  I'm all right.  And now comes the little resistance.  Yeah.  I just love the look of absolute shock.  It's like, why?  You can't.  You can't do that.  I have a vagina.  I have a vagina.  I can say whatever I want and dump drinks on people.  And I never get punched in the face, even though I deserve it. 
[01:25:30]  What are you doing?  She's getting roughed up a little bit.  She's a blunt object.  Let me throw it at you.  Sit your ass down, you fucking meth head.  Oh, and then they start crying.  And they start flipping out.  And will not sit in that fucking seat.  And they always yell, you're hurting me.  You're hurting me.  Because in their life, there's always a bouncer who's going to run in and break it up.  And she's crying her eyes out in this shot now.  She keeps getting up.  Now she's laying on the floor crying.  Her fucking shirt is falling off. 
[01:26:00]  That's great.  And the guys are staring at her.  Yeah, like she's a little kid.  What's on the floor?  Is that all blood on the floor?  What the fuck, Danny?  What happened there?  Yeah, she got fucked up a little bit.  You see, right here, when they block the camera, I think she got a little tune-up.  Oh, wow.  It looks like she got punched in both eyes, but it's really the forearm shiver to the nose.  Yeah.  Oh, broken nose.  Damn.  Yeah, broken nose.  Broke her fucking nose.  That blackened her eyes.  She fell off the chair on her face. 
[01:26:30]  A lot of blood on the floor.  All right, let's...  Holy shit.  Did she get fucked up?  She got off easy.  Look at her.  She doesn't need collagen.  Those are some badass black eyes.  That's a lot of blood on the floor, huh?  And then they're wheeling her out.  Whoopsie.  Hey, Matt on Long Island.  What's going on?  There goes my theory.  There goes my theory.  Yeah, you fucked up Bill's whole theory there, Danny.  Yeah, he had to show me the fucking one where they actually blasted her in the face.  What's going on, Matt?  Hey, how are you guys, man?  I'm a new series subscriber, and I've been listening to you guys for a long time. 
[01:27:00]  You know, even back in the BAB days for you.  Ooh.  And, you know, I got to tell you, I like listening to the other guy, but I think I'm switching  over a little bit.  I think I'm moving.  You guys are pulling me in like a moon around the Earth's orbit, you know?  A moon around the Earth's orbit.  All right.  I got you.  I got you.  Well, we don't want to lose you, so all right.  We'll go with that.  You know, don't want to blow it now.  It says a WNEW listener, which means you haven't heard us in a while, and now you're starting 
[01:27:30]  to turn back into us?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I haven't heard you guys in a long time.  Or tune back into us?  That's pretty cool.  And what?  You got the Sirius app?  No, no.  I'm actually, I got the, I guess now it's old-fashioned, but I thought it was cool two  days ago.  I got the thing on my dashboard.  Oh, that's okay.  Old school.  No, that's all right, too.  But Sirius XM just came out with an app, and it really is amazing.  I'm getting a bunch of tweets today, and people are like, because of the app, Opie 
[01:28:00]  and Anthony back in my car.  Yep.  See?  That's all they got.  How does it work?  How does it work?  Well, because we have a lot of fans that don't listen to us in the car, because why?  Why?  They're broke.  See?  I go like this.  Yeah, you just, I press the little app button.  All right, well, or, go ahead.  Well, he asked how it worked.  You could just tell me rather than demonstrate it like some game show host.  And then, yeah, there it is.  I hit my favorites, because I am my favorite.  And then I've got to put it up to my ear like I'm on the phone. 
[01:28:30]  It says Bill and Keith the Cop.  No, we're not.  The reason it's in the car, because now you can dock your iPhone.  That's what I was getting at.  Not how the app works.  That's easy.  Well, exactly, yeah.  But you can plug it in and plug it into your car.  You know, because I know my Ford has a little jack that I plug in.  There, see?  And they start crying and will not sit in that fucking seat.  And they always yell, you're hurting me.  You're hurting me.  A little delay.  Because in their life, there's always a bouncer who's going to run in and break it up. 
[01:29:00]  And she's crying.  Oh, all right.  So if I, so I can get that on my phone.  I can plug my phone into my car.  Well, if you got the iPhone.  Yeah.  There's no BlackBerry jacks in the cars.  The cars are starting to show up with like, you know, iPhone jacks.  Or you could just take your headphones, you know?  That's true, too.  No, I can play an iPod in my car.  Yeah.  Right.  If I can do that, can I do that with my phone?  We could do it with an iPhone.  Not with your BlackBerry.  Do it with an iPhone.  You know what?  Fuck, fuck everything. 
[01:29:30]  Matt, thank you.  I always just have to buy something else.  All right.  There you go.  Matt's now listening to us, which is good.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Phil cracked me the fuck up.  You know, fuck everything.  Just everything sucks.  Like, what kind of a human being?  How long can you stand in a fucking line for a phone before you just have a goddamn respect  for how long you live on this planet?  Respect for yourself.  For yourself.  How bad do you need the time wasting?  How bad do you need the product on the first day?  I never understood that.  Dude, I was the other thing.  I get excited about products, but I'm like, if it means standing on line all day, fuck that. 
[01:30:00]  I'm not doing it.  I'll wait until next Tuesday.  The line will be a lot shorter.  And I'll be, you know, I don't know the difference.  Ninth Avenue, I was having a sugar craving, like some chicken or period, and I was like,  fuck it, I'm going to get a cupcake or some sort of cookie.  There was this fucking line coming out of Amy's bread, and I stood in it.  15 seconds in, I was snapping at 45.  I'm going to fucking stand in line for a goddamn cookie.  Good.  Fucking losers.  Snap.  Yeah, good. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy, oh, boy.  Another 10 minutes, I'll get a slice of red velvet cake.  You're a fucking loser.  Just put a piece of gum in your mouth, you asshole.  Save $7.  I can't stand on lines for anything.  It's not worth it.  It isn't.  All right, we got a great story that hit yesterday after the show.  There was no announcement.  Like I said, there was no announcements made.  There was nothing.  It wasn't until their plane touched down at Newark International Airport that most of  these passengers aboard Continental Flight 61 found out. 
[01:31:00]  The pilot flying their plane died mid-flight.  I said, what happened?  You know, we wanted to leave the plane.  I said, no, no, you have to stay.  You have to wait.  I said, why?  So we didn't know.  Somebody right behind me heard, but then I didn't know if anybody else knew, so we didn't  say anything at all out of respect to the family.  This is incredible.  I mean, this is not even coming from the airline until you're telling me this information.  But the 247 passengers got off safely after two co-pilots took over. 
[01:31:30]  Apparently, the pilot passed away about three hours into the flight from Brussels to Newark.  In hindsight, some of the passengers are glad they didn't know.  It's scary, but it's nice to know that, you know, in all honesty, it's good to know that  they didn't tell us, because I think that would have raised more of a panic than anything.  Overseas flight.  And of course they got off the flight safely.  They were on the ground at that point.  Well, also, that's what you haven't expected.  It's like if you're in a biplane and the fucking pilot dies, then yeah, you're in trouble. 
[01:32:00]  You're fucked.  You're in a 777 with two first officers and a pilot.  Yeah.  And the pilot goes.  You got two guys there still that are completely qualified on the plane.  How psyched was that third guy always has to sit sideways?  He's always nodding off.  He finally gets to sit up in one of the front seats.  That little fold-down jump seat.  But someone had to remove the dead body from the main seat and take that seat.  That's creepy.  And then what do you do?  And put a sheet over the guy?  One of those horrible fucking airplane blankets over his head?  I would love to listen to the black box.  You think it's going to start smelling before we land? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, shit.  Strap him in the jump seat.  Put a sheet over him.  His bowels in the cockpit.  Oh.  Don't you lose your bowels when you die?  Oh, God.  Poor bastard.  Had a stink in there.  Poor bastard.  And then he's just dead in the cockpit.  Somewhere in the cockpit as you're just...  And they just...  They should have done like that scene in Airplane, where they're just dragging him through the aisle  to the back of the plane.  Right.  Fucking got his captain's shirt on and shit.  And a couple of flight attendants just dragging him to the back. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, they would have done that a long time ago.  Oh, yeah.  They would have.  And the whole cabin would have been smoking.  My God.  What happened?  And a big fucking cloud of smoke.  Everybody fought in World War II, so they've all seen dead bodies, so it's no big deal.  Yeah, I've seen that.  It's like, whatever.  Nothing compared to what my friend went through.  Yeah.  I remember seeing Benny.  Half his head was apart.  Big cloud of smoke and the fucking fuselage.  Half the people in the back know how to fly.  Yeah, yeah.  Or parachute.  B-17 in the wall. 
[01:33:30]  All right, get up front.  You can fly this, baby.  An announcement went out over the intercom requesting a doctor to the cockpit.  One of the doctors who responded said the pilot was already dead.  Well, of course he's going to say that.  Jesus, yeah.  They asked for a doctor.  He goes up there, and, you know, the results are the guy died.  You're going to say, well, he was dead before I got there.  There's probably some nerd who just plays flight simulator, just always wanted to go up there.  Yeah, let me get up there.  I got to check out a real cockpit.  I can do this.  Already dead. 
[01:34:00]  There was nothing he could do.  The 61-year-old pilot appeared to have suffered a heart attack.  Although it may be alarming for the passengers on board, Captain Lee Collins says there was never really any danger since there are three co-pilots aboard the plane.  When the pilot or captain became incapacitated, both the other crew members would then slide into their duty stations and continue the flight normally with no effect of safety being seen.  Regardless, it was, to say the least, a nerve-wracking experience for these travelers. 
[01:34:30]  Why?  No, it wasn't.  They didn't know.  Yeah, it wasn't.  First of all, they didn't know.  What was nerve-wracking about it?  As they're getting their luggage, they found out.  Yeah.  Fucking news.  It's amazing.  They didn't know.  No one knew.  Yeah, and then nothing really major happened other than this guy died.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's not big.  Or the service.  I'm sure they were still feeding them.  Have you guys ever seen Airport 77 where that guy in the little plane has the heart attack and he crashes into the big plane?  Oh, yeah.  Crashes into the big plane. 
[01:35:00]  I saw that the other day.  You can't believe how fucking...  Was that the Chuck Heston one?  It's...  It's...  Yeah, that's the one where, like...  Where they've got to lower him into the big hole in the plane?  Yeah.  And you know what's funny is Airplane is making fun of that movie, and even as funny as Airplane is, it's not as funny as Airport 77.  It's a real movie.  You're absolutely right.  Oh, wow.  Jim Plunkett is in that movie.  Jim Plunkett.  A young, unknown, Erica Strada plays a character either named Hector or Jose.  It really is awful to watch.  And then the lead girl, the stewardess who's actually flying the plane, has a lazy eye. 
[01:35:30]  What was her name?  I can't remember who that was.  All I know is the line is when...  Karen Black?  When Charlton Heston gets back in the plane and he's able to fly it, and he wants her to go back downstairs  to be a stewardess, he goes,  Do your thing, baby.  Baby.  Do your thing, baby.  It was just like, all right, you sexy stew.  Get down there and shake your ass, honey.  Toots.  Make sure the coffee is fresh.  Go walk the track, you fucking whore. 
[01:36:00]  I'm going to fly us home.  There's Isaac.  Is this...  Here's a great story from John in West Virginia.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, I got a little death story for you.  I'm a paramedic down here in West Virginia, and we're driving a patient to the hospital,  and my paramedic partner in back taking care of the patient dropped dead of a heart attack.  Jesus.  Wait, so the...  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  So the paramedic who's taking care of the sick person in the back of the ambulance died? 
[01:36:30]  Yep.  He said my chest hurts and fell over dead on the bench.  Like that?  That quickly?  That quickly.  So what the fuck did you do?  Well, I pulled over, called for another truck, and pulled him out and did CPR on him while  the other patient was in back, freaking out.  Holy shit.  But she ended up suing us and getting a nice little check of money.  So what?  Why did she sue? 
[01:37:00]  Because she didn't get the proper care she needed.  Well, the guy died.  Wow.  Exactly.  Wow.  Good story, John.  Thank you.  Yep.  Punching out.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jared in Maine.  Jared.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  Yeah.  My buddy's brother is a deep-sea lobsterman, and they were out there off to the...  He landed into the sidewall and ended up getting some massive internal bleeding. 
[01:37:30]  They did CPR on him for, like, two and a half hours.  The coast guard...  It's always the best part of the story.  I know.  I know.  And then what happened?  So she stands over me, starts lifting up her dress, and...  Isn't that cool?  Anyways.  All right.  What happened?  What happened?  The coast guard turned around once they realized that he was dead, so they had to steam back for  two days with a guy dead in the wheelhouse.  All right.  So we got the end of the story.  And sort of what happened to the guy. 
[01:38:00]  Wasn't that Forrest Gump?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  There he goes.  He bailed out before.  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Joe in Philly.  Joe!  Hey, man.  I'm here in Philly, and the main story here is that the guy that actually landed the plane  is from Philly.  Okay.  But he's a pilot.  So the big story is a pilot landed a plane.  Don't make it sense.  Yeah, that's the big fucking headline there. 
[01:38:30]  I'm so glad.  Pilot lands plane.  I'm so glad a lot of you guys are on board with us with this crap.  They make news out of nothing.  Dude, as much shit as TMZ gets where nothing happens, I mean, so much of the news is the  same thing.  It's just nothing is happening.  The people on the plane had no idea what was happening.  And they weren't in no danger.  Both of these guys were qualified to fly this plane.  Right.  I'm sure the captain probably had more hours and, you know, whatever.  But those guys were completely qualified to fly and land that plane. 
[01:39:00]  So they went over the intercom and said, hey, attention, please.  Yeah.  One of the pilots died, and everybody freaked the fuck out.  And then they realized that they shouldn't have done it.  Then there's a story.  Yeah.  But a guy died of a heart attack.  Yeah.  Which sucks.  Yep.  Hey, little Nicky's coming up the hallway.  Hey, little Nicky's coming up the hall.  He's got a hat on.  Coming to work for this Friday.  Really?  Who's this?  This is little Nicky.  He arrives every day at this time. 
[01:39:30]  Hi, little Nicky.  Hi, little Nicky.  He looks just like little Nicky.  All right.  Let's go over to the phone and say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Same guy, see?  Showing Bill Perfect.  Now Bill's part of the bit.  He arrives every day around this time.  And we stop the show just to say hi to him.  When he doesn't wear the hat, it's fucking uncanny.  It's classic.  He's got the same hair.  Yeah, he fucked us up with the hat.  I think he's trying to walk by without us stopping the show.  He knows you do that?  Oh, yeah.  We stop the show every day.  And just go, oh, here comes Bill.  So now I think he's wearing a hat so he can try to sneak by without us noticing. 
[01:40:00]  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, John.  Hey, I was just thinking, what are they going to do with the pilot?  Dress them up like Weekend at Bernie's and have them say goodbye to everyone?  Oh, my God.  They just stand there at the cockpit door waving his arm.  Yeah.  What I heard in that story, it sounded like the people on the plane had to wait to deplane.  Why wouldn't you let them leave first and then go get the dead body?  Yeah.  What's the urgency of getting the dead body off the plane? 
[01:40:30]  From what I heard, they had to get an answer as to what killed him.  Like preliminary, the health department.  So if it was some kind of communicable disease or something, then there might have been a problem.  So they decided they would go in, check it out, talk to the guy, say, how did your pilot die?  All right, boys, watch it out.  They should have had the dead pilot.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[01:41:00]  They should have had the dead pilot continue flying the plane because it's pretty much on autopilot, right?  I wonder how long he was dead.  I wonder if he had a loud heart attack or one of those ones where you just fucking slump over.  Or just kind of laid over and then just like, oh, Gus had a rough one last night.  Yeah, look at him.  Look at him.  That's probably why he was dead.  He was taking cell phone pictures of him, drawing mustaches on him.  Oh, shit.  Why does he have dick on his head, written on his head?  We thought he was just sleeping.  Awkward.  Sorry.  That'd be hilarious once they realized he's dead and they got to wipe all this shit that they wrote on him. 
[01:41:30]  How long was he flying the plane dead?  Ah, three hours?  We were playing Pinochle.  All right, whatever.  The rest of these are okay.  We'll move on to this fine story we brought you yesterday, but now we have even more audio.  Yeah.  My daughter can't be herself.  She can't sleep.  This East Patchogue mom is talking about her 16-year-old daughter traumatized over what their 44-year-old landlord, Louis Bosco, did to them. 
[01:42:00]  Bosco, who lives in this trailer, rents his home to the Hayduka family, which recently discovered the landlord they trusted was watching their nearly every move.  He was videotaping my daughter, who's 16 years old.  He had a camera in our ceiling, which there was holes in my bathroom and in my daughter's room, nowhere else in the house where there are holes put in.  And my daughter and son both saw the monitor with her room on it.  Police say Bosco installed cameras specifically in a bathroom and bedroom used by the teenage girl. 
[01:42:30]  Jesus.  Such a hot story.  Anthony.  You know, if you take the personal anguish and psychological damage out of it, all it is is a hot story.  You know, you're kind of right, Ant.  You take the criminal element.  It's very wrong.  The perversion.  The father anger.  You take all that emotion out.  Think like a Vulcan on this one.  Think Porky's.  You know what you're thinking?  You're thinking like that guy who's like, what's a guy, basically a pilot landed a plane. 
[01:43:00]  And you're saying basically a man wanted to see a teen.  See a hot body on some girl.  Yeah, undressed.  But the guy blew it.  He had a monitor in his apartment.  And on the monitor was the bedroom.  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  They're looking going, ah, hello, that's my room.  Wait a minute, that's my sister's room.  Who, he left it on like an idiot?  Yeah, he got sloppy.  That's how he got caught.  That's the only reason he got caught.  Ah, that's hilarious.  That's like when your phone rings and you left whatever you were jerking off to on tube 
[01:43:30]  eight on your laptop and then your girl walks by.  Really, Bill?  Really?  Hey.  What are you doing here?  What can I tell you?  What can I tell you?  I kind of like naked pregnant women.  Yeah.  Just some horrific thing.  He sure doesn't look like a creepy guy that would put a camera in a 16-year-old girl's  room.  Oh, God.  He looks like Malkovich in Rounders.  Yeah, he does again.  We've trusted this guy with my family.  My kids went to the movies with him.  He bought my daughter a dog.  We trusted him. 
[01:44:00]  We let him in our house.  We ate with him.  We treated him like a family member, and this is what he did to us.  All right.  The police say the landlord installed the camera.  Hold on.  Time out.  How many more fucking idiots are going to let other adults leave with their children?  Please.  Thank you.  No, it's over.  The dumbest fucking thing you could do is let your kid be alone with some guy, especially  if they think, you know, oh, he could be trusted.  We trusted this guy.  We let him take him camping. 
[01:44:30]  Camping.  I let him bathe her.  Uh, you know.  This guy was a family member.  He used to walk.  I mean, how many times was he over here having a slumber party, and he'd forget his sleeping  bag, and we'd let him share it with our daughter.  Yes.  I mean, this guy was a family member.  We trusted him.  I can't believe this.  He'd wipe their asses.  I mean, this guy was close.  And then he does this.  Every time he needed Vaseline, you know, it's like, here, you know, what's mine is yours.  I mean, this guy was a family member. 
[01:45:00]  You're a fucking idiot.  Takes him to the movies, gets her a fucking dog.  You can't be that trusting.  I got a puppy for you.  How many times he's driving my kids home from the movies, and he's got to make a stop  off at the fucking sex toy store, and he's 20 minutes late, and I don't break his balls.  I mean, this guy, we trusted him.  This guy was a family member.  He had to get her the dog so he could threaten to kill it if she tells.  Oh, Jesus.  That's like what you do.  I'm going to kill your puppy if you tell your parents.  He got her kids a dog.  He was giving him candy. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, this guy was just.  Old hack.  Offering them rides.  In his van.  Yeah.  Would you?  This is what he did to us.  Police say the landlord installed the cameras in an attic that he had exclusive access to.  The Haydukka family, his renters for five years, say the incident has turned their lives  upside down.  I really would like to go over to right now and kill him.  I shouldn't say that, but I would really like to hurt this guy, and I can't because  there's laws that protect him.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, that's one of those deals.  If I was on the jury and he fucking whacked that guy, I'd be like, yeah, well, you know,  very angry.  I'm very upset at this gentleman.  He came in the house.  He was a friend of ours.  He broke bread and hymen.  Oh, let's say hi to Corey in Virginia.  Corey.  What's up, bubba boy?  Hey, Corey.  Hey, you guys got to bring back line of the day, man.  You guys have been killing all week, and I hope your line about looking at pregnant chicks 
[01:46:30]  was, it would have gotten at least runner-up, buddy.  Yeah.  People don't listen to me.  The thing is, that wasn't a joke.  I just took it as, that's what Opie likes looking at.  Yeah, people don't listen.  That's why it was so funny, man.  Who doesn't look at a good pregnant chick every once in a while?  It's hot.  Yeah, that fetish is, I don't really, I don't know.  I like seeing, like, women pregnant on the streets in New York sometimes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why?  Because you know that they had dirty, unprotected sex.  Yeah, there you go.  That's it.  Go to the naked one. 
[01:47:00]  You filthy boy.  No, the naked pregnant girl having sex, that's not my thing.  Oh, Jesus.  See, that's not my thing right there.  Look at her fiery fucking bush.  Yeah.  That's not my thing.  Oh, my God.  Can you please...  What about the one up top?  Which one?  Yeah, that one.  Which one?  Let me see that.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  They just stopped shaving.  What, are they afraid of cutting the baby's head?  Oh, yeah.  It's hysterical.  There's no fucking...  That's a big bush.  Because they can't see it anymore.  That is just the weirdest thing, that that's how babies have to be made.  They have to grow inside other people. 
[01:47:30]  It's stupid.  You know, I was on a plane one time, and this girl was describing everything that happens.  Like, your intestines get pushed all the way up.  It's like, what?  I got heartburn and hemorrhoids.  Hemorrhoids and all sorts of...  Sounds sexy.  You know, you're kind of right, though.  In the year 2009, you would think there'd be some kind of small business that they figured out where...  Like fucking mechanical wombs.  Yeah, where you have your kid in some kind of thing, a jar or whatever, whatever you want to call it,  and you just visit the progress every once in a while. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That would be like rich people would...  They already have like the nannies.  Right, yeah.  Rich people are so distanced from their kids.  Yeah, they just don't want to...  That's a nice big general statement.  It's true, though.  I see it all the time.  I see the black nannies with the white babies, and you never see...  I know, it's like it's the fucking 1800s.  But you never see the mom or...  Fucking Tom and Jerry or something.  It's like, Jesus Christ, can you push your own goddamn kid down the street?  Not in my neighborhood.  You never see it.  When you see the mom and the baby, it seems strange. 
[01:48:30]  What happens to the people?  It's gotten to that point.  It's out of place.  They must have lost a lot of money in the stock market.  They're pushing their own...  Right.  They're pushing their own child down the street.  What went wrong with their family?  That's great.  When the doctor fucking gets the baby out of this girl I'm looking at a picture of.  That tat down by her twat over there.  It's nice.  That girl, she's just fat.  She's not pregnant.  That's a truck stop whore.  The girl by the sink, is she pregnant?  What is that?  She looks like...  Oh, it's one of those.  I love those. 
[01:49:00]  You click on the picture and it takes you to some fucking porn site.  Let's say hi to Brett in Boston.  Brett.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Brett.  Hey, Ant.  So you've lost the title of fancy man for the day.  I've got a new black 32 gig iPhone DS.  Motherfucker.  And it's on?  You're calling from it?  Yeah, actually, it's pretty good.  And it seems to have actually held a signal for more than 20 minutes they're driving.  Now, what did you need to get that, sir?  Your license?  Yeah, license, social security, last four of your socials, and credit cards. 
[01:49:30]  Everything the government needs.  Game, set, and match.  Game, set, and match.  I just look at Bill.  I'm like, everything the government needs is like, game, set, and match.  Can't you buy unlocked versions now?  Isn't there a way to do that?  Yes.  I don't know.  Dude, do you realize how free you used to be?  I mean, granted, you had to go out and go shoot a pheasant to go fucking live.  But, I mean, you were born.  Talk about off the grid.  Nobody even knew you were alive.  Yeah.  Until you died.  No, they didn't even know that.  You got a death certificate.  Yeah, you didn't have a social security number. 
[01:50:00]  You had none of that.  Oh, you're going way back.  No one knew that you even walked the earth.  I thought you were.  You're right.  Look, I know in my life.  Unless you were a famous old guy.  In my life, I didn't get a social security number until I was like, I think like eight or nine,  when I finally opened a bank account at like 10, 11, when I got a paper route.  Yeah, yeah.  Or paper route, as they say on the Midwest.  But that's when I finally got it.  But I knew guys who, you know, they're just bums.  They were just bums and they never had a job or anything.  And then they just started working under the table. 
[01:50:30]  Like, I used to hang out with a guy and like the big joke when we'd get drunk.  We were like, the government doesn't even know this guy exists.  Because like, he never paid taxes.  He didn't register to vote.  It's like, what's his face at the end of Goodfellas?  Ray Liotta.  Yeah, yeah.  I never paid taxes.  I never voted.  That's what this guy was.  You could actually be that guy.  Off the grid.  And if you wanted a house, they had a house raising party.  You didn't have some 30 year fucking mortgage.  We don't have freedom in this country anymore.  We talk about that all the time.  It's gone. 
[01:51:00]  It's completely gone.  There isn't that, you know, freedom that was so precious to the early Americans.  You can walk on a sidewalk.  It's still free to do that.  Try walking through your neighbor's backyard.  No, they're going to know.  Try walking through a park at night.  Because now they closed the parks and the beaches at a certain time.  They're going to know every dime that you fucking make.  Everywhere you are at all times.  What you spent it on.  Go old school and just take a gun and go, you know, hunt for your own food. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, see how long you can fucking walk around before you're just shot.  Right.  Like, you can't hunt for your own food anymore.  What's our real freedom?  Look, I don't want to live the way, but there's got to be a happy medium towards that and the fucking police state that we're rapidly headed towards.  What's the real freedom we have in this country at this point?  You can get angry when they take a picture of you and you have to pay the ticket.  There you go.  There's a freedom.  Oh, good Lord, am I pissed off.  Something happened to one of my friends the other day. 
[01:52:00]  He was driving through Manhattan.  And he said he came up to an intersection.  The light's green.  And then there's traffic kind of in front.  Sure.  So he couldn't get across the intersection.  Right.  But the light was green.  So he pulled up behind the traffic because he saw that it was moving.  Right.  And the light would remain green and he'd be out of the intersection before that happened.  So somebody stopped for no reason.  So he started beeping his horn. 
[01:52:30]  And a pedestrian's walking across the crosswalk.  And the pedestrian got all pissed off.  And my pal just starts yelling out the window at this guy.  Go, F your mother.  Stuff like that.  Just really getting pissed at him.  Why don't you want to say it was you?  The light is still good.  What?  Well, no, no.  I don't want to say it was you.  Because I would, but it was a friend of mine.  Okay.  So then traffic starts moving again.  Well, at that point, one of these traffic enforcement people come up and scan his registration right off of his windshield.  Just go out of nowhere.  The light was still green. 
[01:53:00]  And my buddy goes, what are you doing?  And the guy goes, you're blocking the intersection.  And he goes, the light is still green.  The traffic is moving.  He's moving now, is what he said.  And the guy goes, what's your name?  And then my buddy goes, look, I got to get out.  No, no.  He didn't give the name, but he said, look, I got to get out of the intersection.  And just drove away.  Just drove away from the guy. 
[01:53:30]  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  Fucking Cub Scout.  What do you fucking do?  Look at the light.  It's green, first of all.  I'm not going to survive, dude.  I have too much of a fucking temper.  So I just want to know what will happen to this guy since Reggie was scanned.  But that was it.  He'll probably mail you the ticket, and then you just give it to Keith.  He'll take care of it.  No, no, not me.  It's a friend of mine.  Oh, yeah.  It's a friend of mine.  But he never got the name of my friend.  It's a moving thing.  It was like an intersection thing, but there's too many things going on. 
[01:54:00]  Was his friend on his way to a gun range?  No, he actually wasn't.  He was on his way home to nap.  In his heated pool?  I think he does have a heated pool, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  I hang out in similar circles.  Well.  I thought you didn't talk to your neighbors.  No, it was a friend.  Yeah, it was just a pal.  You'll be fine, eh?  Oh, pal.  Hey.  You'll be fine.  It was a friend of mine.  It wasn't me.  They make it very easy, though, now, with the scanner thing, where they just scan your 
[01:54:30]  Reggie.  They scan your windshield, and it's like, hi, you're fucked.  There you go.  There you go.  There's no talking to me.  There's no doing anything.  It happened to my girl.  She was waiting to do alternate side of the street parking.  She was double parked like you're allowed to do.  And somebody came by, just like Anne said.  And what did they say to her?  I forgot this story.  Forget it.  I'm punching out.  You're in the system.  I'm punching out, though.  No, but basically, she was in the right and said that to this broad, and after she did 
[01:55:00]  the broop, she goes, yeah, prove it.  Oh.  But I forgot the exact circumstances.  I don't treat those traffic enforcement officers like they think they're supposed to be treated.  They think they're supposed to be treated like cops.  I give cops the utmost respect.  I give those people nothing.  I wouldn't give them the time of fucking day.  They're tax collectors.  They're the dentists of police officers.  They're tax collectors for the fucking city, is what they are.  Here, let me fucking collect a little more money for Bloomberg.  What kind of an asshole would say, like, don't you still feel like you're on the same level as that person? 
[01:55:30]  I'm like, why would you fuck someone like that?  You should still be.  I wish I was a fucking meter maid.  It's a power thing.  I would never make my fucking quota.  It's a meter maid.  Why wouldn't you let people go?  You're giving these people's power that they just don't deserve it, don't understand it, and they really get into having this power.  All pissed off people.  Look at her.  Did you ever see this guy?  This guy rules.  What's his name again, Danny?  This is good old Jimmy Justice.  Yeah, we love Jimmy Justice. 
[01:56:00]  Have you ever seen the Jimmy Justice videos?  No, but I love it already.  Is this the best one?  Probably.  Yeah, start it over.  Start it over.  Start it over.  Pot this up.  For Bill Burr.  You're going to appreciate this.  See, here's a guy trying to make a difference other than me just bitching.  He goes after the meter maids that, you know, fuck with you.  Says New York City traffic laws prohibit a motorist from parking.  Oh, fuck.  You need to go back there.  Within 15 feet of a meter.  Okay.  Why is this the law?  Because if there were fire, the firemen need to get the hydrant as fast as possible.  Hmm. 
[01:56:30]  And there's a traffic enforcement car in front of a fire hydrant.  During a fire, evidently.  Yeah.  And that cunt would have fucking written you a ticket and just scanned you if you were parked  in front of there.  So this guy with his video camera goes finding the lady.  Are you on drugs?  What is your problem?  You're a traffic enforcement agent and you parked your official vehicle blocking a fire 
[01:57:00]  pump and there's a fire outside with firemen out there and they have no access to the pump.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  He's yelling at her.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself while you're in the store.  You don't hear the sirens.  Friends, what's the matter with you?  Oh, man.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  See, this is the beauty.  She can't do anything to this guy.  Nope.  Because she's not real NYPD.  You're supposed to enforce the law and not break the law.  Africa's safe. 
[01:57:30]  What's the matter with you?  It just is busted.  Yeah.  Where's his catchphrase, though?  Where he goes, I'm.  I don't know if that's in this video.  There's another one.  Okay.  There's another police meter made in front of a hydrant.  I don't call them police because even the NYPD will call us and go, yeah, we fucking hate those people, too.  They're the worst.  They're pissed they wear the NYPD uniform.  And the reason for that is so they're not getting. 
[01:58:00]  So they're not.  Here we go.  Don't you think there's something wrong with blocking a fire hydrant?  Don't you think there's something wrong about filming somebody?  No.  No.  I think you're a police officer who's supposed to enforce the law, but you violated the law by parking your official police car.  You have to do, okay?  Blocking a fire pump.  Somebody else would get a ticket for that.  What's wrong with you?  Excuse me.  What's wrong with you?  Ah, she's blocking her name off of that. 
[01:58:30]  D-U-L-A.  Carl, what are you doing?  Move away from the vehicle.  I'm filming you breaking the law.  Miss Dooley, you broke the law.  Yes, thank you, sir.  You broke the law.  Thank you.  What are you going to do, bite me with your gold tooth?  Oh.  No, he didn't.  I'm going to call 3-1-1 and I'm going to file a report against you.  You won't, you just do that.  Right, because you just broke the law.  You have all right to do it, okay?  And I'm going to do that. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  And I have it on video.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You made my day.  You made mine, too.  Thank you.  Okay, bye-bye.  It's a jerk-off.  Wow.  What did you say?  Jerk-off?  Jerk-off.  I got the number on the card.  Her name.  Jimmy Justice.  He's not using his catchphrase anymore.  He used to have a catchphrase.  There's commercials.  No, commercials.  That's fantastic. 
[01:59:30]  They're all from the same fucking mold, too, those traffic enforcement.  All, they eat a little too much.  I've never seen a white traffic enforcement officer, either.  I don't think I've ever seen one.  They're all like, sorry, this is what I'm doing.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  How the fuck did you make this into a black-white thing?  Well, it is.  Yeah, there's no white meter maids.  They fly them into Wisconsin.  I don't understand.  From Chicago.  I don't understand.  To write tickets.  How a minority can get the majority of a certain job. 
[02:00:00]  It's like at the airport.  Same thing.  I look out that window.  I see baggage handlers.  I'm like, what happened?  What happened?  I see fucking the security people.  Name another awesome job that they're getting.  Meter Maid taking luggage off of an airplane.  Better than fucking.  Driving cabs.  Better than a lot.  Oh, those sons of bitches.  Car cab drivers are of a very diverse occupation.  Really?  Syria.  Meter Maids.  Saudi Arabia.  Meter Maids have a disproportionate amount of fat black women in that job. 
[02:00:30]  That's all I'm saying.  You should be a casting director for Hollywood movies.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  And then when you have a New Yorker, he goes, hey, I'm walking here.  Somebody from Boston.  I'm going to park my car next to the lobster.  Jesus.  You know, we were really going somewhere with that. 
[02:01:00]  And then you just had to bring your hate.  You had to bring your hate.  What?  My opened eyes?  I had a BJ Honeycutt shirt.  I had a McLean Stevenson.  Take it down a few.  I just noticed these things.  And I say them.  Oh, no.  That is, if you go out there, you will notice that is the majority of the people that are  filling those jobs.  You know what he does?  He does racist Jerry Seinfeld material.  What's the deal with all these black meter vids? 
[02:01:30]  And they're never in shape.  I don't know how they get the gigs.  We got the Jimmy out of shape.  They're walking from meter to meter.  How?  Are they still fat?  And then that exercise.  Come on.  They're doing cardio.  Walk a little further.  Come on, George.  Kramer, would you like to add something?  Yes, Jerry.  I would, Jerry.  They're all a bunch of...  I'm still laughing at the BJ Honeycutt shirt. 
[02:02:00]  Come on.  Hey, where's the Jimmy Justice catchphrase?  It's 5-11 gear, my friend.  Look, it's got a built-in holster.  I know.  Hit it.  I am Jimmy Justice, and your days of running around this city like a cowboy are over.  Jimmy Justice, you love him, but he's a tool.  We love him.  Check out his videos online.  Jimmy Justice.  All right, we'll do a little F-U line as we go to break here. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  All right, here's the deal.  Opie and Anthony.  Most people know I'm a huge golf fan, and the U.S. Open is at Bethpage, and they suspended  play yesterday because of that horrendous rain.  Yes.  I'm starting to think they're going to be playing on Monday.  Aye.  Greg Opie Hughes, the third, need two tickets to the U.S. Open for Monday, because I think  they're going to be playing on Monday. 
[02:03:00]  Somebody make that happen.  Wow.  Therefore, I will not be doing the radio show on Monday.  Why don't you send that intern out to make it happen?  Oh, yeah.  He's very successful.  How do I make that happen, for real?  Go to StubHub, dude.  Don't we have a golf channel on XM, right?  So we can get the tickets.  Sirius XM could get me the tickets, can't they?  Can they?  Would they?  Who do we ask immediately?  We'll find out.  All right, we're going to find out.  Two tickets if the U.S. Open continues Monday. 
[02:03:30]  I want to go.  Or I'll go tomorrow if you've got tickets.  How do you, like, watch that?  It's over such an expanse.  Well, the best part, I've been to a lot of golf tournaments, and the best part is the dummies  that they look at their program like this.  Oh, let's go follow Tiger Woods for a while.  Yeah.  You want to know how you see Tiger Woods play if you're at the event live?  You have to sacrifice an hour and a half of your time.  Instead of wandering on the course, you have to go six holes ahead of Tiger Woods. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, you've got to lead him.  You have to find, if you're lucky at that point, to find where you could be the front of the ropes.  Tiger Woods finally comes by about an hour and a half later.  If he hits the drive right, he's right in the middle of the fairway, and you're there perfect.  Like, right on, I get to see Tiger Woods.  This is so cool.  He hits his iron shot toward the green and walks off, and that's how you get to see Tiger Woods.  And that's it.  You get to see Tiger hit one shot if you work it out properly. 
[02:04:30]  You can't chase him.  Have you guys ever talked about those people, the confidence they have on a professional golfer's ability  to stand in front of somebody just off to the side with your face?  I mean, at some point, John Daly, one of these guys, is going to slice a hook.  You've got to explain it a little bit further.  What happens is the ball's off the fairway.  It's in the rough or sort of in the woods.  And now they make, yeah, that small, extremely small path for the golfer to hit through. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  And it's all just people in the way, basically.  It's like they're looking for the next subway to come.  Yeah.  But that's how you see Tiger Woods if you go to one of these events.  It's impossible to follow someone like Tiger.  You can follow like a scrub.  You can follow the scrubs all day long.  But the top golfers, you don't follow those guys anymore.  Can you heckle them?  Can you just sort of follow them the whole day?  Well, the best was when...  Hey, Kenny, is that master still hurting?  You know what?  The best was the U.S. Open a few years back when it was at Bethpage.  And it was Phil Mickelson's birthday.  So the entire time he was walking around the course, they just sang happy birthday. 
[02:05:30]  So one group thought they were clever.  They sang happy birthday to Phil Mickelson as he's walking by.  And then up near the green, another happy birthday.  Next tee, happy birthday.  Next fairway, happy birthday.  The entire fucking time he was walking around the golf course.  Oh, God.  Was he sweating under his man tits with anger?  Going to golf events is fun, though.  What do you do?  You just get boozed?  Yeah, you drink and you just try to take a peek at some of these guys hitting the ball. 
[02:06:00]  The weirdest sporting event I went to, I went to the Indianapolis 500.  Oh, how was that?  Two years...  Oh, dude, it was the best time ever.  Not for the cars going round and round.  Oh, no, dude.  First of all, you start a pool.  There's like, whatever, like 30, 40 cars.  You got four guys.  You all get 10 cars.  You're allowed to bring your own booze in there.  Right.  And then you just sit there praying for someone to hit the wall in front of you.  And you get absolutely shit-faced with these rednecks.  Dude, the difference between what's going on in the pits, like this space-age technology 
[02:06:30]  to get these cars to go as fast as they can, and then the fucking retard in the stand.  Woo!  It goes by.  It's hilarious.  And I was part of the problem.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Yeah.  That's quite the...  You just stand there getting shit-faced, and all you just hear in the distance, you just  for a fucking... 
[02:07:00]  Now, that guy is either the first car or the last car, and when the whole middle part  goes by, you just hear...  And then there's just more drinking for like another minute, and then they come back around  again.  Then you're like, where's my guy?  I lost a guy.  Fuck, I'm down to nine guys.  But you can't even see your guy from your vantage point.  Dude, somebody hit the wall in front of me, and you think they're going to hit the wall  and stop.  They don't.  They've got to slow down to fucking zero. 
[02:07:30]  So they hit it at like 200 miles an hour.  The most amazing thing is to actually hear the tires screech, like you'd hear in an intersection.  Oh, right, yeah.  Because for some reason, you never really hear that on TV.  I guess you do now, because they have the cameras in the car.  Like, this guy hit the wall, and it was just like...  It was like...  And it just like shot all the way down.  Jesus Christ.  And it's just like some debris.  Like a mile away from where he hit.  Oh, and you see everybody, like near where, like the wall.  He was like, he's going to hit the wall.  And then you realize it's coming at you, and they're like, ah!  You do that pathetic, now I'm going to run half a mile an hour as this fucking thing 
[02:08:00]  is doing 200 miles an hour at me.  I'm going to get a distributor cap to the back of my fucking head.  Went two years in a row, dude.  But it was, it was a, I just don't have the time, it was a great, like, I would go to  a stock car race in a fucking second, because that's even more redneck, dude.  Oh, more redneck, yeah, yeah.  NASCAR.  Oh my God.  Yeah, the 80500, not so much.  NASCAR, absolutely.  I'm not even talking Daytona, I would go to Talladega.  Is that the one right in the middle of Alabama?  Talladega.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  You got to go to some...  Some Klansman signing autographs before the fucking show.  You got to go to the lesser known ones, like the Pocono 500 or something.  No, I like the ones where they got to be able to air it out.  I hate those ones where they're driving sideways the whole fucking race.  Short track, you need a big tri-oval.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mongo the Trucker.  Mongo!  Morning.  Good morning, Mongo.  The worst thing about watching golf, and I'm a huge golf fan, is why do these idiots stand  next to the tee box on a 540-yard par 5, and as soon as a guy hits the ball, he goes, 
[02:09:00]  Get in the hole!  Yeah.  Oh, you're shitting this.  Oh, yeah, that goes on every fucking drive.  A hole-in-one on a par 5, yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucking hilarious.  People are asking what I think of Tiger Woods 10.  I started playing it, and I don't know yet.  I don't know yet.  Uh-oh.  I was hoping for a big jump in the graphics, and I'm not seeing that.  Not there.  Gameplay is good, but I was really hoping the graphics were really going to jump ahead, 
[02:09:30]  and they're just not for some reason.  Look at us.  What?  We're all in our 40s.  We're still playing video games.  I was just thinking that.  Back in the day, you'd be trying to bang your secretary.  But when I was shot at Scotch in your bottom drawer.  Make it a double.  You know, Bill, you're right, but when I was 12, I planned this life for myself.  I said, I'm going to be-  I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm just saying it's weird.  I know, but this is exactly what I wanted when I was a kid.  You know what I wanted for my birthday?  When I was a kid, I'm like, I'm going to find a job where I never have to put a fucking 
[02:10:00]  tie on, and I'm going to play fucking video games and do whatever the fuck I want.  That's what we were talking about during the break, how lucky we are.  I planned this for myself.  Yeah.  I didn't step into this.  I said, no, this is it.  Yeah.  I didn't know if it was going to be radio, but I was finding something where I didn't  have to put a suit on and have a cubicle.  Mark.  Sorry to you guys out there that have to-  I was talking to Anthony about how lucky we are, how I did the show yesterday at 11.  I went back to my hotel room, and in the middle of a fucking workday, I slept from 11.30 
[02:10:30]  to 3.30 in the afternoon, and when I woke up, no one was mad at me.  I was just like, this is fucking ridiculous.  This is rules, man.  It is good.  I'm 41.  I think I'll watch a cartoon now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll play some video games.  Just fuck around.  It's great.  It's TV.  It's all research.  Just shit to go off on.  But, I don't know.  What's your favorite game right now?  I'm doing the Tiger Woods, but-  Oh, I don't play video games.  I'm too addictive, man.  I'll kill my whole day. 
[02:11:00]  That's why I don't go game to game to game.  I pick just a couple.  Right now, I'm trying to beat Brick Breaker on my BlackBerry.  I had a- I said it on the show, and I forgot, but it was a couple hundred thousand on my Brick  Breaker, and then I fucking had a BlackBerry problem.  And I pulled- I did the hard restart or whatever, and I pulled the battery out, thinking that  my fucking score would still be there when I put the battery in.  Oh, shit.  Fuck no.  There's no way you had a couple hundred thousand.  I swear to God.  You get halfway through the game, you'll be lucky if you have 10,000 points. 
[02:11:30]  What?  All the way around, my friend.  Start all the way around.  If you can get through the second cycle, then it gets easy again.  The second cycle?  Yeah.  I can't even get past level 16.  Oh, no.  No.  You'll get there.  You'll get there, Bill.  Just keep wasting your life.  But honestly, now I can't get close, because now my button doesn't work as well.  Because I did it when my phone was brand new, so the little fucking ball was rocking.  Oh, yeah, whenever you get the laser?  Now it kind of sticks a little bit.  It moves to the side when you didn't want it to, and you lose the ball. 
[02:12:00]  All right, fuck it.  So now my current high score is only 32,000.  I can't get past that.  Jesus, I've never broken 10,000.  Really?  I can't get past.  I just, I'm really not good at it.  I don't play little, like.  I like those easy ones.  I like the old school Tetris.  I need fucking, like, space shuttle controls and giant monitors and graphics cards that  sound like turbines.  You can't play those in an elevator.  This is a great elevator game, because I live on the 40th floor, so I sit there while 
[02:12:30]  everyone else is getting on, getting off crap, and I'm like, well, this will kill the few  minutes I'm in the elevator.  I got a couple of shitter games on the iPhone, but for the most part, you know, I like big  fucking monitors and graphics.  You know, I've always, this has totally changed the subject here, which is as far as maybe  still being an immature ass.  What I asked for my birthday, you remember those old light beer from Miller commercials?  Remember those big goblets that they would have the beer in? 
[02:13:00]  I don't know why.  You want to be pimping?  I really enjoy drinking beer out of a glass now, and I wanted one of those glasses.  Yeah.  Remember, you used to get them at Pizza Hut.  Do they have, not Pizza Hut, not Pizza Hut.  I know what to do.  Papaginos used to have them.  Yeah, the big, like, glass, there, there, like, something like that.  Oh, the Shemay.  Like a big, uh.  Shemay-may.  Yeah.  Shemay.  Like that, yeah, yeah.  Back when everybody died of ass cancer at 58.  58.  Not 50.  I want one of those. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, that big Schlitz thing.  There you go.  Yeah, perfect.  I drink out of Pilsner glasses now, because I got a tap in my house, you know?  So I just, like, I drink out of the Pilsner glass.  Those fuckers tip over too easy.  I know, the dumbest design.  It's like, let's put all the beer, the heavy beer at the top, and put it on this little  fucking pinhead of a bottom.  Oh, but it makes it taste better, though.  Dude, you have literally the Netherland Ranch for someone who doesn't molest kids.  Well, little do you not.  Heated pool.  Yeah, yeah.  Beer on tap. 
[02:14:00]  Movie theater.  You motherfucker.  Bill, you hit on something.  That's awesome.  I don't want to lose these phones.  Rob in Ohio.  Rob?  Yeah.  Hey, Bill, if you really want to go to something hillbilly, you need to go to the Bowling Green  tractor pole.  All it is is a bunch of drunken farmers, and they bring their girlfriends, and they all  take their shirts off and flash each other.  I would love to go to that.  Sounds nice.  As long as I know, I wouldn't get fucked up.  I just feel if I open my mouth there.  Yeah.  It's a liberal.  God damn it.  All they do is they take, like, cases of beer. 
[02:14:30]  They'll have two or three cases of beer each person.  Right.  They're angry.  And it's, like, three days long, and all they do is watch tractor pulls and drink during  the day.  Then they pass out at night, and then they get up again the next day and do it again.  Mm-hmm.  That would be perfect.  Woodstock for rednecks, basically.  Oh, getting back to Brick Breaker, too, Bill.  This guy had a half million with 32 lives left, and he dropped his phone.  Battery popped out.  He lost his game. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, damn.  I forgot what my score was, but I had 70 guys left, too.  I got to the point where the game was not going to end, ever.  Ever.  The only thing that's...  I had 14 lives, and then I got to that one where...  One of those ones where it has, like, the bricks you can't break.  All right.  And the thing keeps coming down.  Yeah.  The U-shape?  I couldn't get past that.  That's a nightmare, actually.  And I lost 14 guys on that.  It was a bloodbath. 
[02:15:30]  Because now the wall's right in front of you.  It was fucking General Custer.  I'm still remembering.  The wall's right in front of you.  You just serve it.  It just goes...  Yeah.  Because you have to angle it a little bit.  Oh, and you have, like, Tourette's.  No, and then when the thing...  You know what the worst thing is?  Is when it goes flying, and you make, like, that unreal save, but then it's going 90 miles  an hour the other direction.  Brick Breaker fun.  And then you just start heating up and getting hot, because you're like, all right, I still  got 13 lives.  Yeah.  All right, 12's okay.  Nine, eight... 
[02:16:00]  This is fucking bullshit.  All right, calm down.  Calm down.  Five lives, four lives.  No, I refuse to get upset by it.  I'm not going to get...  No, I did get to the point where I was not going to lose.  I was gaining lives way more than I was losing.  I would lose one every once in a while because I was getting bored, and then I would add another  five or six, but...  Jesus Christ.  Not no more, because I fucking...  The ball on the Blackberry is sticking or something.  I can't get anywhere near that anymore.  Ball on a ball.  Oh, let's... 
[02:16:30]  Why would you need that?  Let's say how to Christian Columbus.  Touchscreen, accelerometer.  Hey, Bill, what you really need to go to the races is either a radio to hear the radio  broadcast or a scanner where you can hear the in-car audio, the communications, because  without that, you're really missing the boat.  And as far as there being idiots, the Oakland A's have three guys on their roster with  college degrees, which is the most of any team in MLB, you'll have at least that many  college degrees and the guys jumping over the wall to change tires in any car race. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, is it...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Is that really true?  Most of the Major League Baseball guys don't have college degrees?  No.  I mean, they're all dunderheads.  I mean, they're guys that maybe go to college for a year or two, but yeah, there was just  a study.  The Oakland Athletics...  Wow.  ...leaves the majors in degree holders.  They only have three on their roster.  See, I would believe that for the NBA just because a lot of the guys are, you know, bailing  early and stuff.  I didn't know that baseball players bailed early.  Well, most of them are from the Dominican Republic at this point.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Something just comes straight into a farm team. 
[02:17:30]  So they do a year of college, a couple years of college, and go right into a farm system  somewhere.  Yeah, well, in the NBA now, it's a status symbol for players to go back and finish up their  coursework after they're in the league.  Because Michael Jordan went back and got his degree.  Shaquille has an NBA.  Yeah, just in case he wants to go and get a job somewhere.  A nice office position.  Well, that's why I always laugh when these dopey sports shows talk about, like, it's not  good that these guys are leaving college early to start a multi-million dollar fucking career. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, and on any given play, you can blow out your knee.  Yeah, but they're insured, and they're going to fatten up their bank accounts, and isn't  that what we all want in life?  Yeah, exactly.  So if you could fatten up your bank account immediately, why would you continue playing  college basketball and sacrifice losing your knee or something and never getting that  chance?  I think college kids should get paid.  Yeah.  I mean, more than, like, the free education.  Dude, college education.  The amount of money they bring in for college basketball and the universities themselves? 
[02:18:30]  Of course.  If you play for Michigan or Ohio State, I mean, the 100,000 people coming to the, I mean, I  know that you're also, like, the program was there before you got there, but you also,  you keep it going.  Dude, a college education, unless you're going to be a fucking doctor or something, or an engineer  or something like that, if you're just some majoring in business, a majoring, like me, communications,  it's fucking stupid.  Dude, college, uh, yeah.  It's a total ripoff.  You end up leaving there, you're 50 grand in debt if you're lucky.  Yeah, you're right. 
[02:19:00]  For what?  A college degree is a waste of time in most cases.  Dude, and the whole thing.  In most cases.  Yeah.  In most cases.  You show up to the classes, half, I've been talking about some of my act, half the classes  I took, the required reading was a book that the fucking teacher wrote.  It's like he's hustling us.  Oh, shit.  He's like a rapper.  He's, like, selling them out of the trunk of his car.  It's like...  And then you leave college and you're, like, 50, 60, $70,000 in debt.  Yeah.  Unless you're lucky enough to have your parents, you know, fucking do the right thing if they  could for you.  But most of the students out there are paying their own loans back. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah, you're fucked.  So all of a sudden, you enter the working world in debt already.  Behind.  You're behind.  You qualify for a credit card.  You're fucked.  Most kids, but before they even make the dumb move on knocking some girl up in your 20s,  the stupidest fucking thing you could ever do.  So they're already, like, you know, $100,000 in debt, $80,000 in debt.  By the end of my first semester in college, I realized it was a bunch of horse shit.  I knew I wanted to get into radio, but it was no guarantee.  But they had a radio station, so I'm like, well, this isn't horse shit because this is 
[02:20:00]  something I really want to learn.  So I'm going to work at the college radio station.  If it wasn't for that, I would have bailed and fucking filed a grateful debt or something.  Get a life experience.  Yeah.  For real.  Yeah.  My alma mater was $22,000 a year when I graduated, and they just crossed the $50,000 a year threshold  this year.  And that was 17 years ago I graduated, and I cannot believe that that education has improved  that much in that period of time.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  No, you know, you've got bankers printing money with no gold behind it.  It just drives up the prices of shit.  It's all bullshit.  I went back to my college, actually it's been a couple years now, Geneseo, and they  jacked up the prices to go there for the same horse shit fucking campus and a horse shit  place.  Yeah.  They all go after Big Oil.  Nothing changed like this guy said.  They jack up the prices so they can buy more real estate and buildings with your fucking  money as you're getting the same two plus two equals four.  Yeah.  As you also said, Bill, they keep you in debt. 
[02:21:00]  That's everyone's mission.  They bitch about Big Oil in this country.  Why don't they bitch about Big Education?  I mean, those guys have a license to set the price whenever they want.  Not everybody needs to go to college.  They completely devalue people going into the trades.  That's what they need to be focusing on.  You know, get people out to be able to be viable and get a job without a worthless piece  of paper.  The world needs ditch diggers too, you know.  Right.  I'm with Bill. 
[02:21:30]  But don't listen to us.  I mean, these are just dumb opinions.  There's probably a lot of kids out there that will now drop out.  I did a college kick.  My experience, it was a waste of time.  I did a college kick and the teacher was telling these kids, most of the stuff you're  majoring in, the jobs aren't going to technically really exist.  Just how rapidly shit is changing with technology now.  So I don't know, man.  If you get like three, four guys, you have a business idea and starting like a website,  I mean, that seems to be like the quickest way.  Because other than that, you're just some drone.  To millions. 
[02:22:00]  And why?  Well, you don't go broke, but you're just sort of eking along, making somebody else's  dream come true.  I think it's a dumb way to go.  I was discussing this with someone recently.  And why don't they teach us stuff that we really need to know?  Like how to fucking get a mortgage.  How to not get ripped off getting a mortgage.  How to do the math on a mortgage.  How to fucking balance a budget.  But, you know, stuff that you really use in life.  No.  You know what I mean?  Gotta learn about Mesopotamia.  Yeah, right.  You head out into the real world without a fucking clue on any of this stuff that you  really need to know. 
[02:22:30]  How banking is legalized loan sharking.  I had an argument with this guy.  Anytime I ever bring that argument, I go, what's the difference between loan sharking  and banking?  They go, well, a fucking bank won't break your legs.  They always think that's a great point.  It's like, because they don't have to, you shithead.  They'll take your house.  Yeah.  Repossess your car, destroy your car.  Would you rather have a broken leg or a fucking, you know, ruined credit rating, no house,  living on the street, motherfucker?  The reason why a loan sharker breaks your leg is because what he does is not legal.  Because you're like, I'm not going to pay you. 
[02:23:00]  What are you going to do?  Take me to court?  Yeah.  Call a cop?  And then he snaps your leg.  Oh, okay.  I get it.  I get it.  I'll have that for you on Thursday.  All right.  All right, kid.  I got it.  All right.  Today.  Today.  48 Major League Baseball players have college degrees.  48?  48.  48.  So it tells me there's a lot more players than 48.  Fuck, I learned something today.  For some reason, I thought baseball guys got their degrees.  Let's say hi to Brendan in San Diego.  Brendan.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, you want to know, on opening day this year in baseball, 29% of the starters were born 
[02:23:30]  outside of America.  28%, huh?  That makes sense, though.  Mm-hmm.  It's truly an international sport.  I would have thought it would have been a lot higher.  Yeah.  That's more than that.  And then the other thing is the ex-running back for the Denver Broncos, Tatum Bell, at  the beginning of the season, he was working at a kiosk in the mall selling phones.  Oh.  That's not good.  No, they don't put their money away.  They don't know what to do. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Yeah, because you don't learn that stuff.  No.  You just assume the money's going to last forever.  Well, you get a million dollars.  You think you have a million dollars.  You don't realize it's really, like, about $350,000 once everybody takes their piece for  helping you, and then the government comes along and takes a big whack out of it.  So then you go out and buy a fucking $400,000 car, and you're going to buy your mom's a house?  No.  You're fucked.  And then you blow out your fucking knee, and then you're working the kiosk selling fucking 
[02:24:30]  Verizons.  The best is when you buy it before the IRS takes their chunk, and then they come back  and go, hey, where's our cut?  Oh, wait, but I spent it.  Oh, yeah?  Did you?  On what?  That house?  Our house?  The only way to win, if you want to get off the wheel, is to fucking make a million a  year and live like you make $50 a year, and then you just pay Elvis taxes.  Yeah.  They're going to take $900 away, but you won't be in debt.  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  That's the only way to win.  But they will not let you get rich unless you come up with some fucking unbelievable idea  where they can make way more fucking money off of you.  Other than that, it's like hail.  They just keep fucking punching you in the face with some sort of...  It's like a certain number you just can't get past.  They fucking choke you out and just take you down to the mat.  You're like, all right, all right, sorry.  I'm sorry.  I was trying to get rich.  I like the hail idea.  They leave you outside in the hail until you go, all right, I need your help.  Okay, okay.  All right, I'll go inside. 
[02:25:30]  Anthony in Florida.  That's a fucking scam.  The best inbred racing in the country has got to be in Naples, Florida, the Swamp Buggy Races.  Oh, shit.  That was a great...  That's for you, Bill.  Used to watch that on the old fucking...  ESPN2.  ...country TNN, the Nashville Network.  Used to watch that.  Yeah, it's the Swamp Buggy Races here in the swamp.  He's going through the sippy hole, and he's coming around out by the mud pit. 
[02:26:00]  There's all these fucking backwards motherfuckers with no teeth, riding these...  Yeah, these things.  Yeah, but do you realize, seriously, though, the ability that you have to do...  To build that buggy?  How do you keep the engine dry, or whatever the fuck you get to be?  Exactly.  They figured out...  Look at these guys, like...  And you gotta just slide through those turns.  They're driving on water.  Oh, yeah.  At the end of the race, there's a missed Swamp Buggy.  It dives into the sippy hole.  Yes, Miss Swamp Buggy.  That rules.  Yeah, it jumps in with the winner.  Very good.  I used to watch that shit. 
[02:26:30]  You know what I love about...  That was exciting when cable...  Like, when cable first had, like, all these channels of this shit, and all of a sudden,  you're like, God, I could just watch bull riding if I want, or watch this bull shit.  Yeah.  You know what's funny about, like, most of the cars that you see there?  All of them are modified.  For as much shit as rednecks get, I mean, it's not like they're idiots.  Yeah, they can figure out how to turn a fucking wrench.  Socially, sometimes they have backwards views of looking at people.  Those sons of bitches.  My car looks exactly the way it looked like from the factory. 
[02:27:00]  They sure know how to fucking...  I put a Corvette engine in it.  How'd you do that?  I put some steel balls out the back to let people know what the fuck they were dealing with.  Let's go to Georgia.  Wes, what do you got, buddy?  Yeah, man, I was wondering if y'all heard about this kid, Bryce Hopper,  just talking about dropping out of high school and getting his GED  so he can go into professional baseball early.  Yeah, he's supposed to be some kind of phenom, right? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, he's hit like a 570-foot home run, throws like a 96-mile-per-hour fastball.  I'm 16 years old, and he should.  He should.  Get your money when you can.  Why not?  No, I would maybe at least finish going through puberty.  Ah, fuck that.  And then kind of, you know, I don't know.  Get in there.  If you're hitting 570-foot home runs and you can throw the ball 96 miles an hour,  guess what?  High school's not for you.  Get the fuck out and make your fucking money. 
[02:28:00]  I guess you're right.  Even if you blow out your arm in a year.  I can be convinced of anything.  Yeah.  All right.  But even if you blow out your arm in a year, that's like the average dude,  that's like 20 years of work in the real world, right?  Look, if that was my kid, and he was 16 years old,  and he wanted to get like his GED, like I would be like, yeah, you know what?  You'd need a good argument.  I wouldn't even do the GED.  I'm like, let's say goodbye to high school,  and let's say hello to the major leagues.  You'd need an argument to come back at the kid with. 
[02:28:30]  What's your argument?  It's you should go to school.  Why?  I'm not a fan of these athletes getting their degrees.  It's stupid.  No, I would say do the GED.  I already think if I ever have kids and they don't want to go to college,  I would be like, yes, why would you?  Do you want to be a doctor?  Unless you want to learn how to slice somebody open,  or you want to make a bridge.  There's no fucking, it's just a waste of money.  Just hang around.  You'll get plenty of tail and save yourself 50 grand. 
[02:29:00]  The money you'd spend on your tuition, just go buy a car.  Just get some fucking work somewhere.  Get a job.  Get a trade.  Hey, we got the Rednecks calling.  They're very excited.  Richie Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, Bill, brother.  What's going on?  Talladega, man.  Talladega.  Check it out.  Oh, yeah.  I was there, man, and a chick like six rows in front of me, good-looking chick, man, 
[02:29:30]  flashed a crowd or whatever, man.  As soon as her shirt went back down, dude, she'd throw a dip of snuff in, no doubt.  I couldn't hear what he said.  She did what afterwards?  She did some dip.  She flashed.  She turned around, she flashed her tits, put the shirt back down, and did a little dip.  That's what I'm saying, to sit there and drink next to a guy who talks like that sober, it  would just be the greatest thing ever, and you could see a car hit a wall at a buck 80.  It would just be fucking great.  Richie Rich.  Hey, she was a hammer, man, no doubt.  Richie Rich, do we sound funny to you?  Because I know we got a lot of Rednecks and Southern guys that are listening to this show. 
[02:30:00]  Do we sound funny to you like you sound funny to us?  Yeah, a little bit, man.  Yeah, a little bit, man.  Right on, man.  That'll sound like Elvis.  Yeah.  Yeah, man, let me tell you something, man.  You're going to have yourself more trouble than a little bit.  Hey, I'm going to punch you out, boss, so y'all give me more hair, all right?  All right, Richie Rich.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Footer.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, I want to rewind a little bit.  Sure.  First of all, real quick, though, I can't believe how dumb they sound. 
[02:30:30]  Before you said that, all these hillbillies were calling up.  I'm going, holy fucking shit.  These Rednecks sound like idiots.  But anyway.  Jesus.  Really quick, just to rewind.  And we were talking about golf before and how, like, you know, we just don't get it.  My dad, dude, he's like, you know, it's like your fucking pop, man.  He's so cool to me, like, cool guy.  And he's telling me this story how he went to Augusta, and he's going, yeah, as I walked  over the fairway, he goes, it just, it choked me up.  I got a tear in my eye.  I want to fucking spit in his face, dude. 
[02:31:00]  That is like, I don't get it.  I don't get fucking the whole golf thing.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, they're...  You know what?  We were sort of listening.  They were a little distracted.  Danny put a picture up of some redneck playing horseshoes with toilet seats.  Is that a fucking sport down there?  Of course it is.  Toilet seat horseshoes?  Part of like the Redneck Olympics.  Come on.  You throw the fucking toilet seat like you would a horseshoe.  It's one of those that have the, you know, the little slit in the front.  What do you call that?  Yeah, of course. 
[02:31:30]  Toilet seat so you don't piss on the fucking toilet seat.  Yeah, the opening in front there.  And you know the redneck's really trying because he has his tongue hanging out.  That means he's concentrating.  Yeah, he's really concentrating.  He's into toilet seat fucking horseshoes.  Footer.  So the story is your dad was telling some golf story and you're like, holy shit, who gives  a shit?  Well, you get to the fact that, you know, your dad's a cool guy and for him to tell you  this story, how he's walking over a fairway and he gets a tear in his eye, I wanted to  fucking spit on him.  It was just, I don't get shit like that.  You know what I mean?  I love golf.  I don't take it that far. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  And real quick, to bring it back to me because you guys are distracted, E-Rock's a big fat  slaw.  Punch it out.  There you go.  Now we're focused here.  Thank you.  I heard that.  Yes.  Well, let's say how to Bob in Georgia.  Bob.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I wanted to tell Bill about an event down here in Georgia called Swine Time.  Swine Time?  Yeah, Swine Time.  All right.  What they do is they get a bunch of kids and a bunch of old guys and they grease up  a pig and just have them run around in a hay bale and you have to catch them. 
[02:32:30]  And it's between old people and kids?  Yeah.  Everybody just gets involved.  First person to catch it wins like a t-shirt, I think it is.  Oh, that sounds great.  You know what I love, too, is PETA probably doesn't have the balls to go down there and  break that one up.  Oh, no.  Fuck, no.  And then after they're done with that, they have a chitlin eating contest.  Oh, Jesus.  That must look wonderful.  They have an old guy down here called Jack Wingate.  He's a big fishing legend down here.  And he ate a chitlin that's about two feet long. 
[02:33:00]  And one bite just right down.  It was disgusting.  Now, let me get this straight.  Basically, you boil the intestine in the shit smell.  You get all the shit out of it.  So he basically swallowed a pig colon.  Yeah, and I work for a TV station down here.  We filmed the whole thing and we just kept showing it over and over again.  That's awesome.  Do you have that online somewhere?  Yeah, we got to see that.  I can put it online.  Well, you should have, bro.  That should be a YouTube video. 
[02:33:30]  I'll put it on YouTube and I'll send Danny an email.  All right, cool.  We'd love to see it.  Thank you.  Let's go to Scott in Minnesota.  Scott.  Hey.  Hey.  What's going on?  We do pickup pulls in the state of Minnesota.  And we got 900 horse motors going underneath the pickup with flip body.  I don't know what that means.  That sounds like it's a real fast pickup with a flip body.  It's a pickup pull where you take a pickup, hook it to a sled,  and see who can drag it the farther. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, gotcha.  Oh, pull.  I think you said pull.  Yeah, yeah.  No, pull.  If you guys go to YouTube and put Bad Kitty Pulling Team in there,  that's my cousin's truck or Facebook.  Okay.  Is that the kind of thing that will get you some pussy out there?  Oh, yeah.  Actually, my cousin's five-foot, probably about a 120-pound wife drives his pink truck.  It's just another world.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a world.  It's another planet.  It's a world we don't understand. 
[02:34:30]  And it's like the ocean and fish.  It's part of America.  Go.  Can you imagine having a five-foot, 120-pound wife?  He said that like it was the most normal thing.  Yeah, that's what they do.  That's their together time.  But you got to admit, you know, they're not sitting around letting their brains turn to mush.  Hell no.  They're figuring out how to make their truck be able to drag more shit.  Let's not forget about noodling if we're going to be talking redneck stuff.  Yeah, that's great.  Noodling rules.  What is that?  You see that?  You've never seen noodling?  Punch up a noodling clip. 
[02:35:00]  Are you kidding?  Bill, come on.  You know what?  You've never heard of noodling?  No.  Oh, okay.  We got one for you.  Thank you, sir.  Scott of Minnesota, everyone.  Oh, this is good.  As Danny finds a noodling video.  Jake in Kentucky.  Jake.  Yeah, every Fourth of July weekend, we get about 30 goats down at Newburgh Beach on the Ohio River.  And we have goat races. 
[02:35:30]  Goat races.  That sounds good.  Is it just a basic race, or do you throw some kind of little twist in it?  Well, they run about 100 yards, and you can bet on them.  They put numbers on them.  How do you get them to run?  Shoot at them.  You stick something in their hineys.  Throw dynamite at them.  Why do they smack them?  Yeah, you smack the goat, and it'll start running.  They bet on the goat races.  I know this drives Bill nuts. 
[02:36:00]  Here's some noodling.  Thank you, sir.  No, it doesn't.  You know something?  I actually, I don't know if I've ever told this.  20, 20, 25.  Wait, wait.  Okay, small fish.  Yeah?  Here's the noodling.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  First is coming out.  Two guys in the water.  Right the hole, man.  Up to their heads.  I can't believe you've never seen this.  There you go, Bill.  Yeah, that's a good fish, man.  Yeah, that can't be.  Look at it.  Don't flop around and do it.  Look at the fucking guns on that guy.  Yeah.  You see what's happening there, Bill?  You stick your hand in a catfish's mouth.  No.  You put it in a hole where they live, and you shake your fingers, and they bite your arm, 
[02:36:30]  and then you pull your arm up.  That's how they catch the catfish.  That doesn't hurt?  Well, of course it does.  That's a good one.  They usually get a nice little...  He just wiped his arm off in the dirty water.  And go back in.  That's how they fish for these fucking things.  Yeah, the catfish live in these holes on the sides there.  See, he's bleeding.  And you can't see, because it's muddy, and they put their entire arm in the hole, Bill. 
[02:37:00]  And then the catfish bites on, and then you pull it out.  He's bleeding.  Would you do that?  No, they would have to squeeze my arm.  Like, how hard does this hurt?  You know, they'd fuck with me in the bar.  No, the anticipation would be what would get me.  Yeah, I don't know.  Look at the size of these fucking fish, though.  You know, nothing but respect.  I don't know how you would do that.  The anticipation, that is a giant fucking fish.  A huge, giant catfish.  Dude, can I tell you something?  When bankers sit around trying to think, how am I going to take over the world?  They don't worry about guys like us.  We're pussies.  Those are the guys. 
[02:37:30]  We're like, okay, we need propaganda to get these guys on our side.  Those guys know how to shoot.  They know how to live in the wild.  Amazing.  Chicks doing it?  Oh, they're not as good.  Fuck.  No, man.  That's always cracked me up about women.  They want to do everything that we do, even the dumb stuff.  Let me fucking start boxing and stick my fucking hand in a goddamn...  I don't know what the hell I'm trying to say.  Get a catfish to bite my fucking arm.  Yeah.  They put their tits in there. 
[02:38:00]  Just like...  Hot girls doing it.  That's amazing.  Jeff in Kentucky.  Jeff.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, talking about rednecks.  I was at the Kentucky Speedway this past weekend to watch the Nationwide Series stock  car race, and they had these Xtends girls there, these Xtends, I guess, these penis pills.  Yeah, the boner pills.  Right.  And these dumbass rednecks were lined up around the corner to take a picture with these skanks,  and they were giving them away these hats. 
[02:38:30]  And all day long, you see all these rednecks wearing these red hats that say Xtends, basically  just advertising, I have a small dick.  I need a bigger dick.  They were all over the place.  All right.  Thank you.  Free hat to them.  All right.  Let's go to Jim in Indiana.  We're on to this redneck culture thing.  Jim.  You've got to get the Dukes of Hazzard theme going now.  Yeah.  Jim.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Yeah, there's a couple of DVDs at some of the truck stops I go to called Girls Gone 
[02:39:00]  Grabbing, and there's these hot chicks in bikinis that do this noodling, wrestling these  50-pound cats.  It's really awesome.  Girls Gone Grabbing.  Girls Gone Grabbing.  Yeah.  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  People will just buy anything.  Mm-hmm.  Definitely something to check out if you can find something.  How is that?  Absolutely.  How is that really?  Thank you.  Wes, the trucker.  Wes.  Hey, Bill, bud.  You're missing the greatest part about that race.  You've got to be in the camper lot at night. 
[02:39:30]  You're listening to guys fighting, fucking, and drinking beer all night long.  It's funny as shit.  That is the greatest part of the race, is to be in the camper lot at night.  At night.  It's all fucked up.  They're fucking drinking.  No, you've got to understand, dude.  Like, every hotel is packed, and everybody's got their fucking RVs.  And every way you go, there's these signs that just say, welcome, race fans.  And it's just public drinking. 
[02:40:00]  It's a big party.  It's fantastic.  Thank you.  They fight, fuck, and drink beer all night long, and they turn the park.  It's funny as hell.  Oh, that's great.  Funny as hell.  They fight, fuck, and drink.  Funny as hell.  I'll tell you, that boy, he'd fuck a rock if he thought a snake was under it.  You're like, what?  It is like, what are you talking about?  I love it.  Damn.  All right, we've got to keep doing this. 
[02:40:30]  Don in Jersey.  Doesn't even make sense.  Hold on, I have sense enough to pick up a penny if you saw a dime.  Yeah.  What?  By the way, if you're on the phones and you sound sort of like me or Ann or Bill Burr,  hang up immediately.  Yeah, I want to hear some more of those southern sayings like that shit.  Like, fuck yeah.  Let's learn a little bit today.  That boy, fuck mud.  Yeah, Don in Jersey.  Don't know whether to fight, fuck, or why I'm a wristwatch.  Wristwatch.  What?  Don.  Yeah.  We, uh, we seen a thing on TV the other day with the rednecks racing these old trucks 
[02:41:00]  around the track.  We had to, uh, all had to pull trailers.  Camper trailers, boat trailers.  Oh, shit.  And all the other guys have to try to knock the trailers off.  The last guy pulled the trailer was the winner.  That sounds pretty, that would be pretty cool to watch.  But what does he get, a free Grand Slam breakfast at Denny's?  God damn, yeah.  Uh, and I seen a thing down in Florida.  They had a motorcycle demolition derby.  That's a motorcycle demolition derby. 
[02:41:30]  A motorcycle demolition derby?  Yeah, it was crazy.  You guys have beat up old bikes, smashing each other, knocking everybody off.  What the fuck?  Let's answer the call, man.  Let's go to Ross in Tennessee.  Ross?  Hey, boys.  How you doing this morning?  What's up, man?  What's up, man?  Hey, I was calling to tell Bill, he was talking about his pit bull yesterday, and I'm a big  fan of pit bulls, Bill.  Gotta love you.  Great to talk there.  But, uh, if you go over to my uncle's house, the two of my cousins, right, when you pull onto  the property, they got a sign in the front yard that said, never mind the owner, beware 
[02:42:00]  of the cock.  And when I mean cocked, I mean fighting roosters.  They've got, my uncle's got a rooster standing about two feet, maybe two and a half feet  tall.  That's the meanest fucking rooster you've ever goddamn seen.  They're really fucking eyes at you.  Get out of the damn car.  I promise you.  You got an attack rooster.  You know what I love about, like, these guys, they actually have references to other  roosters.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I know, this is the meanest goddamn rooster you've ever seen.  I've never seen one.  I've never seen a rooster.  I've never seen a rooster.  I don't know how mean they are.  I can't compare it to anything.  Yeah.  I have no fucking...  I need to see one for the first time, and then maybe someday I could go, wow, you 
[02:42:30]  know, I saw another rooster.  Dude, that's why you got to go to those cities, because they start telling you stories with  shit like you don't have a reference to.  Right.  It's April, so the bullfrogs are out.  You know what I'm saying?  You're just like, no, no, I don't.  No, the big old ones.  Big old ones.  Not the little ones that I can see there, and I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm a concrete walker.  I really don't know what you mean.  I'll tell you, this bullfrog could have failed family eight.  It's like a big buck and a KFC chicken, right?  So I got my slingshot. 
[02:43:00]  All right, we're going to get some sayings now.  Big old slingshot.  Travis, I'm enjoying the music, but slightly lower, because our phones aren't as crisp  as they should be.  Charles, South Carolina, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I got some good southern sayings.  Yeah.  Hotter than three squirrels fucking in a wool spot.  Hotter than three queers in a sleeping bag.  Slow down, slow down.  Yeah, slow down.  Hotter than three squirrels in a wool sock.  Hotter than two squirrels fucking in a wool sock.  Yeah, okay.  Hotter than three queers in a sleeping bag. 
[02:43:30]  More screwed up than a brother's checkbook.  That boy would fuck a rattlesnake if he held his head.  There's all kind of funny ones.  I like how he cleaned up the racist one.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Right, right, right.  You know what that was supposed to be.  Oh, yeah.  No, we don't do that down here.  Of course not, man.  Of course not.  Let's go to Jim in Florida.  Jim?  Hey, down here at New Smyrna Beach Speedway in New Smyrna Beach.  They race RVs and school buses, and my brother-in-law's nearing a striped-ass snake. 
[02:44:00]  School bus races?  There's so much going on here with these phone calls.  But you know what's funny?  The excitement in the phone caller, and us just laughing because we have no concept of this.  Yeah, but as much as we're making fun of them like it's dumb, they actually know how to fucking soup up a bus.  Yeah, how bad do you want to go to one of these events, though?  Yeah.  I'd go check out school buses racing.  That trailer one sounds like a pisser.  Dude, drinking outside of a Waffle House right before you go in, it's the greatest fucking...  All right, we got another southern city.  Nine in the morning.  Jason in Indiana. 
[02:44:30]  Jason?  Good evening.  Hey, Jason.  Those biscuits are so good, if you put them on top of your head, your tongue would beat your brains out trying to get to them.  Oh, Jesus.  Where did they come up with that?  Yeah.  Punch them out.  All right, man.  We might as well be talking a foreign language.  Like turkey shit through a tin horn.  Yeah.  What?  Let me see.  Fashioning shit through a goose.  All right, we got another one.  That's right.  Let's go to Chris in Georgia.  Chris? 
[02:45:00]  Hey, what's going on, Opie?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  We used to say, you know, nervous boy, you know, kind of edgy boy.  We used to say he's nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  I heard that one.  I heard that one.  That's the first one I've heard.  That one made it up north.  Yeah, that one made it up here.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, let's go to Bug in Florida.  Bug?  Hey, fellas.  How you doing?  All right, Bug.  Hey, man.  We go over to my cousin's place, my uncle.  He raises fainting goats.  Their legs stiffen up when they get scared.  Oh, yeah.  We've seen them.  Hold on. 
[02:45:30]  We're big fans of the fainting goats.  You've seen the fainting goats.  The wild boys.  I saw them do it.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  That's probably why we know it, yeah.  Bug?  Yeah, so every 10 minutes or so, we set off a bottle rocket, and we bet on which one will  fall over first.  They're pretty hilarious, man.  We should check out that shit alive.  I'm loving this.  All right, let's go to Chris in Virginia.  Chris?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  In Tennessee and Texas, there's these ponds that have alligator gar, and you start up 
[02:46:00]  the motor, and they jump out of the water, and rednecks combine two fun things, killing  fish and bow and arrows.  They need to punch it up on YouTube.  The fish jump out of the water, and they shoot it with a bow and arrow and reel it in.  Wait, so?  It's called bow fishing.  Bow fishing?  Bow fishing.  How do you get them to jump out of the water?  When you run the motor on a idol, it scares them, and they jump right up out of the water,  and they shoot them with a bow and arrow.  There's a dozen videos under aerial bow fishing on YouTube.  Let's check out aerial bow fishing.  All right. 
[02:46:30]  Dude, that's the craziest shit you ever saw.  Serious skill, though.  What's harder than that, hitting a curveball or shooting a fucking fish out of the...  I would try to shoot fucking fish that jump out of the water.  That's a tough one, man.  Why not?  Oh, it's a fucking riot.  We'll try to find.  Did you go aerial?  Yeah, aerial bow fishing.  The internet's being slow today.  Okay.  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  This is bow fishing bugle mouth hogs.  The phones are lit.  What does that mean, man?  They got a reel right on the bow, and you shoot it and reel it in. 
[02:47:00]  Two foot, three foot catfish.  All right.  Let's see what happens here.  I think we might have found one.  All right.  We're...  I took the engine out of my garbage disposal.  Just like, oh, God.  What did you do with it?  Where does it go from there, dude?  Holy shit.  Oh, you reel them in, and they're done.  God damn.  You don't have to do that.  He's beating them over the head with a big fucking piece of log.  Well, you got to get them to behave.  You got to calm that fucker down, let me tell you. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  It's good eating if you get the maximum.  It sure is.  It's good eating.  You got to clobber him over the head.  Let's say hi to John in Virginia.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  Hey, guys.  I was at a party a few years ago, and this guy was just wrecked.  And he said, boy, I'm more fucked up than a cricket in a hubcap.  Bill, come back to Raleigh.  All right, man. 
[02:48:00]  Bill, could you ever reference that?  Ever?  What's that?  A cricket in a hubcap?  I never would have thought of that.  As far as what?  Just life experience.  No, but it makes sense now.  Would that ever come up?  Yeah, it makes sense.  I guess it jumps in there, and it gets fucked in, rattled all around.  Yeah, of course it makes sense, but we would never reference that.  Oh, no, ever.  No, no.  That's what I mean.  Watch out.  All right.  Let me say hi to Wayne in Virginia.  Wayne.  Hey.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  It's that brother so fast, he's like an egg falling from a tall chicken. 
[02:48:30]  Okay.  You never heard that one, man.  Well, there you go.  Look at this.  Holy Jesus.  These fish are jumping like six feet.  Six feet out of the water.  That can't be real.  And they are shooting the fucking bows at them, man.  That's pretty cool.  They just got to be shooting into it, hoping they hit something.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Dude, look at that.  Fuck Brick Breaker.  Oh!  Slow-mo.  I got...  Wow, that's a great shot.  That guy got one. 
[02:49:00]  Look at that.  That...  I would fucking do that all day.  They jump out of the water, and then you shoot them with the bow.  So, that is...  Holy shit.  You think Peter would have a problem with that one, Bill?  Uh, yeah.  Dude, this is why we're at the top of the food chain.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got bored with killing of our food.  We can do that, and we can play banjos.  Yeah.  Yep.  Wow, that is pretty cool.  Why doesn't Peter take this shit on?  Damn!  They don't have the balls to go down there. 
[02:49:30]  Right through.  Right through.  Nice.  It's amazing.  Uh...  Let's say hi to...  He's doing it at night.  Let's say hi to Doug in Georgia.  With a lit arrow.  Look at that shit.  Amazing.  Doug?  Yeah.  Hey.  I was gonna say, you know, those guys are so close, they're pissing out the same dick.  They're so close, they're pissing out the same dick.  Yeah.  There you go.  Let's go to Matt in Oklahoma.  Matt.  Yeah, if there's flicker and goose shit on a brass doorknob, and if it rains a lot, it's 
[02:50:00]  a real turd floater or a gully washer.  These guys can't wait to get on...  Carl, Arkansas.  That motherfucker took my line.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry, Carl.  Anything else?  I like the way you talk.  Yeah, we like...  I like the way you talk.  He does it way better.  Of course he does.  He doesn't have to try.  No.  I was gonna say that the guy was slicker than a snot on a doorknob, but... 
[02:50:30]  Ah, dang.  Fuck.  I'm sorry, bro.  And he said brass doorknob.  Evidently, brass is slicker.  I would never know, of course, because...  Goddamn.  Rob in Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah, when you're real horny, you're hotter than a half-fucked fox in a forest fire.  Punch it out.  Hotter than a half-fucked fox there.  In a forest fire.  In a forest fire.  Let's go to a tank in Oklahoma.  Hey, guys.  Got Doyle's band playing in the background.  Yeah, it sure is.  Why don't you go home and practice, Randy? 
[02:51:00]  Randy.  Play through it.  You gotta play through it.  Get the fuck out.  Love fucking...  Love that movie.  Tank, what do you got?  Dick Dale.  Dick Dale.  Down, down, down, down, down, down, down.  And then the drum fill.  That's such...  It's so perfectly awful.  It's horrible.  Listen to that.  It's all off. 
[02:51:30]  Did it, did it.  It's all off.  We're getting the band back together.  Get my guitar out of the garage.  And he kicks everyone out.  I love that.  Doyle is a douchebag.  You know, I've always wondered if musicians do that shit.  Like the same way comedians will sit around and deliberately do bad jokes and shit. 
[02:52:00]  Like if they try to have a contest, the worst riffs ever.  See how bad you can fucking play.  And what's his name?  Who's the guy that played Doyle?  He's a musician.  Dwight Yoakam.  Yeah, Dwight Yoakam.  Because what makes that great is it almost sounds fixable.  Yeah, yeah.  Like if somebody actually had some true musical talent, they could take that idea and either  attach it to something else or just, I don't know, smooth it out.  Yeah.  They know what they need to do to make it a great song. 
[02:52:30]  Amazingly bad.  They just twist it slightly.  You know, so it works perfectly for the movie.  We'll take another break.  Big Trump, Phil.  Trump, Phil.  It's all off.  Hey, Bill, what are you promoting, man?  Doing a great job for us here.  BillBird.com.  You got the Punchline gig in San Francisco.  July 13th.  And after that, I think like the following week, like the week of July 25th, that weekend, 
[02:53:00]  I'm going to be at the Comedy Works in Denver, Colorado.  One of my favorite gigs, man.  Actually, both those.  One of the two best comedy clubs.  Nice.  Other than Caroline's right here in New York City.  If you're a fan, go to BillBird.com to find out where he's going to be.  Phones are great.  We'll go back to the phones in just a bit.  But first this.  Oh, right on.  KC Dixie.  Yes, I am. 
[02:53:30]  I remember these guys.  Turn it up, Travis.  Let's go.  I remember this, man.  Makes me stiffer than a dime store engine.  God damn.  Let me tell you.  That's good music right there.  That's good music.  Someone's trying to turn us on to Moaning Girl or Formula One Racer. 
[02:54:00]  Come on, Randy.  Hilarious.  See what this person's saying.  Want to see if that's anything, Danny?  It's on instant feedback.  No, I can't hear anything.  What happened?  Oh.  My computer's in the middle of rebooting.  I don't know what's going on.  Ah.  God damn computer.  iPhone.  The iPhone thing is fucking up.  The height of these chairs keeps mushing my nuts.  You know, you're right.  You're right.  Something like these chairs.  You're like when you sit on an airplane too long.  You just fucking, you ball bag.  I've noticed I'm constantly shifting in this fucking chair. 
[02:54:30]  These chairs are not comfortable.  They're just not.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Oh, we have to sit in them for hours and make jokes.  I just realized what I was complaining about.  Some guy's out there with a jackhammer.  Bang!  And I'm like, my chair isn't comfortable for my four-hour bitch fest.  That should be a job that just doesn't exist anymore.  Like, they should have any come up with anything.  It should be a fucking thing.  It should be lasers that just and cut holes in the ground. 
[02:55:00]  There's still some big bruiser with a jackhammer.  His second job is he's fucking, he's behind an oxen.  There's fucking.  Plowing a field.  Yeah, there's film of people using the exact same thing in black and white.  You shouldn't be using anything that hasn't changed at all from when it was in black and white films.  You see his entire body just vibrating.  Yeah.  You think to yourself, that can't be good for you.  No, no.  He's probably just getting home.  He's pissing blood. 
[02:55:30]  His kidneys are busted up like graham crackers.  Isn't it like back in the day?  Like, guys, like, they did that too long and their body would just never stop shaking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, great.  That's shaking.  That's wonderful.  Or the riveters on the buildings, the fucking riveters where they would throw hot rivets to each other.  One guy had like a catcher's mitt made out of leather.  And the other guy would be by the big thing that kept the fire stoked.  And they'd throw these red hot rivets.  The guy would catch it, put it in the hole, and then the riveter would go, 
[02:56:00]  and rivet the fucking things, put buildings together.  It's like, what the fuck is, see, no one does that anymore.  It was new shit.  Yeah, there's not people sitting on girders eating lunch.  Yeah, exactly.  That was a fucking photo op.  Exactly.  Sitting on, no, they did that.  It was sick.  Who the fuck would sit on a, no way?  Dude, I saw it when they were building.  Playing grandos?  No way.  No way.  Where's this garbage?  When they were building the Brooklyn Bridge, I forget, there was some ridiculous amount of people 
[02:56:30]  would die every day.  Not me, no way, not once, not never.  Uh-uh.  Like the Brooklyn Bridge?  Yeah.  It was the fucking...  Well, first of all, they dug down so far, they didn't understand the bends.  And they'd bring people up, and they'd notice these guys, they'd start, you know, whatever,  doubling over.  Double over.  So then they, like, after a few days, they were like, oh, he's having a problem too.  Hurry up, bring him up, bring him up, which would make it worse.  They didn't have a decompression chamber in there. 
[02:57:00]  It was like, it was an airlock to keep the air in the, what was it called?  Not a stanchion, but a fucking whatever that base piece is.  So they would just open up the airlock, and all of a sudden you go from having all this  pressure on you to keep the water, the pressure was to keep the water from coming in  underneath and drowning you.  So they kept it pressurized, and then they'd just pop you out the lid, and go, okay, you're  okay, and then nitrogen bubbles would start in your blood, just, bleh, you'd just double  over in pain and agony and die. 
[02:57:30]  That's a diving thing.  You gotta be fucking careful.  Yeah.  You want more redneck stuff?  Okay, man.  Well, yeah.  Walter, Louisiana, we'll start with you.  You know, eventually these are gonna just start getting racist here, so it's gonna have  to be a cop.  How to take the, yeah, the same fucking ugly route it always takes.  I got a question for Bill Burr.  What's up?  What do you call a redneck woman with two black eyes?  I don't know. 
[02:58:00]  A slow learner.  All right, I've heard versions of that.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Tank in Oklahoma.  Tank.  Hey, man.  Tank.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  I'm listening to the radio.  John in Texas.  John.  Hey, my-my-my-my-boy.  Hey, John.  What's wrong with the kid Billy Sands we got?  Anyway.  Might be through with this.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  I got hotter than a two-packer Billy Goat.  Ain't had this much fun since the hogs ate my little brother.  What the hell is that even?  That had to happen once.  Oh.  Oh, that's how they get away with murder out there.  They feed you to the pigs.  Oh, fuck.  What a great movie.  You ever see that story in A&E?  In the guy's threat?  When he came to the girl, witnessed the murder, and he's just like, pigs gotta eat two.  She's like, all right, I'm shutting the fuck up now. 
[02:59:00]  There's a great scene in Snatch where they do that very thing.  You ever see Snatch?  Oh, yeah.  Snatch is a great movie, man.  Snatch.  Snatch.  Okay.  Joe the Pumper?  Or Plumber?  Joe, what do you got?  Hey, you Yankee sons of bitches.  Now, if all these dumbass rednecks down here, if they even knew what XM radio or Sirius or  any of that bullshit was, they'd say y'all's more fucked up than a shit sandwich. 
[02:59:30]  I think I heard that one.  But you would have to have someone that actually makes shit sandwiches.  No?  I just like the ones that don't make sense.  Yeah.  It makes sense to somebody.  Let's go to Mason.  Mason.  Hey.  Hey.  Down here in Florida, man.  Yeah.  Hey, we're fucked up down here on the panhandle.  If something's too expensive, it's higher than giraffe pussy.  That's higher than giraffe pussy. 
[03:00:00]  Or if something's real tight and it won't fit, that's tighter than a nun's, cunt, man.  You gotta throw in the man.  Man.  It's tighter than a nun's, cunt, man.  I gotta, well, these are great.  Great sayings.  I haven't had as much fun since the pigs ate my little brother.  Yeah, goddamn, we're not fun.  Dude, this will get me out of trouble one day on a gig.  I'll just go into that accent and throw a couple of those sayings out and I'll be fine.  Fucking dandy.  Hey, if a girl's real hot, she's finer than frog's hair. 
[03:00:30]  Think about it.  I've heard that one.  Finer than frog's hair.  Hey, and if she's ultra fine, super hot, I'd walk two miles over broken glass to hear her  fart in a walkie-talkie.  A walkie-talkie.  Oh, shit.  That's great.  Bravo.  Let's go to Ronnie in South Carolina.  Ronnie.  Yes, sir.  I got a saying.  That boy's way through hell just to fight a grizzly bear with a switch.  Way through hell to fight a grizzly bear with a switch. 
[03:01:00]  Yes, sir.  All right.  All right, man.  That must be a badass dude.  Let's go to Kansas.  Danny.  Yeah.  How about that bitch was uglier than a gunny sack full of smashed assholes?  A gunny sack full of smashed assholes.  Let's go to Frankie.  Frankie.  Any source on that?  What the fuck is a gunny sack?  Nothing?  I don't even want to know.  It'll take away from it.  Frankie.  Hey, fellas. 
[03:01:30]  Hey.  My brother's a Pennsylvania redneck, and three of his favorites are that taste so good,  I don't want to swallow my tongue to get more of the taste.  I don't like that one.  Fuck me running.  Which is bad.  I like that one.  But they, ah, ah, fuck.  Punch it out.  All right.  You forgot the third one.  He just got out before the plane crashed.  Yeah.  John, Kansas.  Yeah.  Hey, boys.  Love you. 
[03:02:00]  Love you, too.  Hey, man.  Hey, check out on YouTube, uh, motorized bar stools.  Ah, yeah.  We've seen motorized, uh, bar stools.  Yeah.  Have you seen combine demolition?  Combine demolition.  Oh, fuck.  That sounds like a good one.  Yeah.  Check that out.  And then, uh, up here in Kansas City, we got, uh, lawnmower races.  Yeah, that's the one I know.  Yeah, I've seen the lawnmower races, too, where they modify the lawnmowers, and they go,  what, like, 50, 60 miles an hour?  At least.  Some of them go, like, 90.  Fuck. 
[03:02:30]  That's amazing.  Fucking lawnmower.  Yeah.  Yeah, a lawnmower.  And then, uh, as far as things go, how about this one?  Dryer than a popcorn fart.  Dryer than a popcorn fart?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Finer than frog hair I heard on a Les Claypool album.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah.  He used that expression.  I thought that was his lyric.  Les is all right, man.  And he's fine on frog hair. 
[03:03:00]  He's got that alligator stare.  We got Johnny Fairplay down the hall.  We got, uh...  Something like that.  We got David, intern David here.  Oh, that albacore stare.  Albacore stare.  Yeah, like a fish.  Yeah, yeah.  We got Bobo in his...  He's fine on frog hair.  We got Bobo and his brother here, too.  Yeah, there's a lot of people down there.  We should get some of these people down here, because they're all just hanging out down the  hall.  Let's bring in Johnny Fairplay, Bobo...  I walked through a mile of broken grass.  Intern David.  ...just to hear a fart and a walkie-talkie. 
[03:03:30]  A walkie-talkie.  Oh, God.  Look at Intern David.  Wearing.  He's not an intern anymore, though.  Johnny Fairplay.  Think he's got to, like, disguise himself, because he's so popular.  You're not a fan of the Fairplay.  Dude, I just hate this guy.  I just have nothing about this guy.  Bonaduce put him in the airplane spin?  Apparently.  Oh, this is going to be a classic.  I'm sensing it.  Yeah.  All right.  What's wrong, Sam? 
[03:04:00]  Come on in.  Sam, what's wrong?  I'm just walking up the hallway and hearing Bobo chase after him going,  How was that being on Survivor?  Really?  Because they realized who he was.  Oh, did you?  Whoa, Bobo without a hat.  Bobo, look at you.  Bobo almost looks normal.  You look normal without that Mets hat, Bobo.  My brother is in town, that's why.  What does that have to do with the price of tomatoes?  Yeah, why is your hair all moosed out?  You look all nice. 
[03:04:30]  I haven't seen my brother since my father passed away.  Oh, really?  He's my half-brother.  So you don't wear a hat?  No, I figured dress to impress.  Dude, if you dress like this every day, you'd probably get chicks.  Slow down.  He's got a nice shirt on.  You got your hair moosed up.  No Mets hat.  Well, I'll probably dress like this every time I'm here then.  Well, you're not going to get girls here though.  Yeah.  Well, you never know.  You really just saw the hope die in his face right there. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, well.  Crazy people always got to fuck with their fingers.  Yeah, I know.  Big A.  It's crazy.  Did you say hi to Bill Burr?  Did you say hi to Johnny Fairplay?  How's it going, Bill Burr?  Hey, what's going on?  How are you?  Hey, thank you.  How's it going, Johnny Fairplay?  I didn't realize it was you.  Well, get on mic there, Bobo.  Be on the mic.  I didn't realize that this was Johnny Fairplay because I haven't seen his – because it's  been a few years since his season of Survivor.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  And it's been –  Oh, hey. 
[03:05:30]  Hey.  Easy.  What does that mean, Bobo?  The guy just comes in the studio.  He's trying to have a good time and all of a sudden, look at you throwing down.  Bobo, what do you mean by that?  Well, there's been so many seasons of Survivor, so it's hard to remember.  Get on mic, Bobo.  You've done a lot of radio.  It's hard to remember the face.  Right, right.  It's hard to remember the faces of all the contestants that have been on Survivor.  So what you're saying is just a dime a dozen?  No, I'm not saying that.  Him, I remember – Johnny Fairplay, I remember very well.  He's a – are you saying he's a has-been, though?  Not.  A little bit? 
[03:06:00]  No, no, he's not.  A little bit, right?  I don't think he –  Who is Johnny Fairplay more famous than today?  Who is Johnny Fairplay more famous than –  Not when he was on Survivor, when he was huge, doing what he did.  Yeah.  Now.  Now.  In the year 2009.  Who's – who is he more famous than?  That I'm not sure.  I know I heard he's been boxing lately.  Would you say he's more –  Well, that answers the question.  Yeah.  And really fast, because Sam's in here. 
[03:06:30]  Intern David was holding court outside the studio.  What was he doing?  You remember our 42-year-old intern, Scott?  Oh, yeah, of course.  David was giving everyone an update on Scott that included –  Wait, let David say it, then.  It also included his income.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  He's currently – yeah.  David, what were you doing?  We were just having – me and intern Paul were just having a conversation, and intern Scott's  name came up, and we started talking about him.  All right.  That's awesome.  And what did you say about intern Scott? 
[03:07:00]  What did I say about him?  Yeah, you guys keep in touch?  Yeah, we keep in touch.  Sure, I do.  I heard – I was walking by, and I heard you say – and since he's left the O&A show,  he's been on two family vacations.  That is true.  Not one – and then he has to, like, not one, two.  Yeah.  Why is that a big deal?  It's just a big deal because he was an intern.  He goes from being an intern to going on two vacations.  He went to – he took his family to Disney World, and then he went to something like 
[03:07:30]  Tropical Island in the Caribbean after that.  I like how he's saying it like one of those game show announcers in the O&A 70s.  Two – family vacations.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Why is that bothersome there, intern David?  It's just bothersome because I'm an intern.  I can't afford to go on one vacation.  He's an intern.  Now he can afford to go on these lavish vacations.  How many?  Two vacations.  Yes.  All right.  Bobo, so talk to Johnny Fairplay.  See what he's up to. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, well, I was asking –  On the mic.  On the mic.  What was it like being on that island?  I mean, was there anything that happened that didn't happen on camera that you could talk about?  That's a good question.  Craziness that couldn't be shown on CBS?  Oh, that's a good question, Bobo.  Yeah, wow.  No, most of the time we're just bored, just waiting for challenges to happen.  So if they just showed us sitting around, that probably wouldn't be as entertaining as the –  Well, I'm sure there was something with the alcohol they gave out in reward challenges that you probably drank a few and probably some craziness went on. 
[03:08:30]  They showed most of my craziness when I drank on television.  The only thing they didn't really show was my first tribal council.  I was just hammered drunk.  And we go there, and Jeff's like – well, he's asking questions, and I fall off my chair.  And two of the guys had to pick me up and put me back on the chair, and I actually sent home one of them.  And Jeff's like, are you loaded?  I'm like, I'm fucked up. 
[03:09:00]  And he was like, do you think that's fair to the other people?  I'm like, I don't care.  And if you watch the show, you don't see me fall off the chair.  And he goes, are you loaded?  And I just say, yeah, and it's a real quick cut.  You didn't walk around pulling off at Eastside Dave wearing – I don't know.  You didn't walk around trying to hide a blowgun up your ass or anything like that when you were drunk?  Not on my first season.  You didn't try to accidentally put one of the torches in your ass or got burned by a torch? 
[03:09:30]  Why?  They've got to keep those away from us.  They're more props than anything else.  Bobo, have him give us an update.  What is he up to now?  Well, what are you up to lately?  I know you've been – you're boxing in Philly.  Wow.  Bobo, you did your research.  I'm glad to see you prepared for this interview.  And I remember, I think someone you were boxing once, this guy who was married to, I think, a porn star, Gina Lynn,  who her and her friend, Titty Squashed me on – me and David once, his wife and his wife's friend, Titty Squashed me. 
[03:10:00]  Titty Squashed.  And I remember him saying that he was going to be boxing you in Philly.  How did that fight go?  I don't know who you're talking about.  I'm boxing Lindsay Lohan's dad on Saturday.  Yeah, Bobo, where did you get this info from?  But your proposal sounds much better.  I'd rather do the Titty Squashed.  I remember Gina Lynn's husband mentioning that he was boxing Johnny Fairplay. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, how'd that fight go?  How'd that fight go?  I won.  Ask him about Lindsay Lohan's dad and Lindsay Lohan.  Johnny Fairplay likes to talk some dirt.  So what is there?  Is there some bet that you get to bang a drunk Lindsay Lohan if you beat him?  Yeah, I think that's in the contract.  Nice.  For the press conference, I said, you know, if I win, do I get Lindsay?  I heard she's into guys this week.  And I'm like, but if not, my wife's bisexual, so we can work it out either way. 
[03:11:00]  What is it?  Are you going to get a – well, I don't mean to be an Uncle Paul here, but are you going to end up getting to see a lesbian sex show with Lindsay and her sister?  My mother, who I hear is closing in on the big 1-8 – I don't really know how that family works.  I'm guessing I'm not going to see that.  Well, from what I hear, she's been – from what I hear, her mother has been dressing her as slutty as her sister. 
[03:11:30]  Wow.  Fucking Bobo's going to be on TMZ.  Not Johnny Fairplay.  Love it.  Love it.  Wow, you're a shock jock.  Well, from what I heard, I've been – as a matter of fact, they've got a little thing to tell you.  Oh.  You know how in Queens, how they got those street fairs often?  Yeah.  I'm buying a sausage and peppers with onions, and the lady, this Italian chick, recognized me.  Really?  Yeah, she recognized me. 
[03:12:00]  And my sister is starting to be jealous because a few people at the street fair were talking about – they said, isn't that the Bobo?  Bobo, and she's saying, not fair, how come he became famous before I did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Famous.  Famous.  Yeah, I'm becoming famous before she even does.  You know Johnny Fairplay famous, right?  Right.  Well, I have no idea how famous, but maybe right now I'm starting to be recognized like a reality TV star.  Really?  Wow.  Fuck Bobo.  Or I think – well, anybody who listens to the O&A show, sometimes – some people, though, don't know who Bobo looks like. 
[03:12:30]  But all of a sudden, I know – I saw someone wearing a shirt at a – on the 7 train, and I mentioned, you do know who I am.  Yeah.  Usually, if there's someone wearing a shirt, I try to mention who I am so they know who I am.  Shirts?  And I –  Shirts?  What kind of shirt?  No, he was wearing an O&A shirt.  Oh, I thought a Bobo shirt.  Where do I get these Bobo shirts?  I don't have a Bobo shirt, but I was –  So you just walk up to people on the subway and just go, you do know who I am. 
[03:13:00]  Well, if I do see someone wearing an O&A shirt –  Yeah.  Yeah, but you don't preface it with, I'm on the show.  Do you know who I am?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I'll mention I'm on the show.  And what do they say?  Do they know you?  What do they –  Yeah, like, they say, oh, you're Bobo, and they'll sometimes try to do my Bobo Springsteen bit.  What's the Springsteen bit?  Bill, do you know the Bobo Springsteen bit?  I remember Anthony used to do something to that.  I used to do it, but you know something?  Listen, once you're overshadowed, like I have been with Bobo's impression of it, I don't even do it anymore. 
[03:13:30]  Well, I'll show you an example.  I'll do one about Eastside Dave.  How about Johnny Fairplace so we can hype his fight here?  Wait, do one about –  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Sam's on TV.  You just missed it.  What?  He was just on CNBC.  Shut up.  I just saw it right there.  What's wrong with you?  That is who interviewed me.  Really?  And they are showing –  Yeah, didn't you just see it?  No, no one saw it.  I just saw it briefly.  Are you sure?  Yeah, I just saw it.  That hair – I can see that hair from a mile away. 
[03:14:00]  It's getting –  No!  It's getting so –  It's getting so big.  I can see it from two –  How big is it?  I can see it from two blocks away.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That is big.  If you're driving a convertible, I can see it from maybe ten cars away.  Whoa.  If I'm stuck on the Long Island Expressway, and you're driving a convertible, I can see you from far away with that hair.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  He's hitting heaven.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Bobo was telling me about his dream car is an 88 Mustang Cobra 5.0, but he's been looking around, and he can't do all the adjustments he wants to make to it at first, but the first thing he's going to do is replace the seats with leather seats. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, okay.  That's a good start.  Hey, well, that's me.  I love leather interior in the car.  Well, that's a good place to start, then.  You know I roll.  Yeah, yeah.  But he said he might mention something to you, since you like the fast cars.  Yeah, and I have a Mustang, so, you know. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I was wondering if you could help me get a hold of one.  Here's your LeMaine Heats touch.  Yeah, yeah, I'm the Mustang connection.  It has to be an 88, though.  Yeah, an 88.  An 88.  That's a little earlier than mine.  I don't know.  I've always had a thing.  That thing's a classic, and the sound that thing makes, I want to be heard from a mile away.  How does it sound there, Bobo?  I don't know how.  I can't do the sound, but it's just like... 
[03:15:30]  Think, think, think.  It's made this really loud.  It's like loud like a NASCAR.  That's how loud it is.  Oh.  Like what?  Do it again.  Is that it?  That's not bad.  I'm looking at a picture.  Hey, that's a pretty cool-looking car there, Bobo.  It's like a very loud sound.  My cousin calls it the signature sound.  Let me tell you.  Probably the worst year for the Mustang ever was 88.  That is a horrible-looking car there, Bobo. 
[03:16:00]  No, no, wait a minute.  Now that we have the picture, if you could just do the sound again, we could just marry the two.  Let me, maybe with the sound.  Nice.  I can feel the leather.  Yeah, I can.  Do it later.  Not initially.  It won't be leather initially.  Do it taken off.  You're at a red light.  That is an awful Mustang.  You picked the worst year for the Mustang.  That is the worst year. 
[03:16:30]  It looks, it doesn't even look like, it looks like the year they decided to like make,  the, use the Mustang name to make that, those piece of shit cars.  Yeah, it doesn't look like a classic.  Hey, what if, what if you made the car faster?  What would it sound like?  That's a good idea, Bill.  I like that.  Yeah.  I don't know what it would sound like, but I can tell you it would sound a lot better.  Yeah.  Mike, give us enough.  For.  It went away, so you heard it get lower. 
[03:17:00]  Of course, even the outside, though, I'd probably, I'd probably improve the outside of it.  Oh, you would?  Like how?  What the, who the heck is called?  You know the Mets song is your ring?  Someone's calling me, hello, Brian?  We're on the radio, by the way.  You do know I'm on the radio right now, so I'll have to call you when, I'll call you after.  You do know who I am.  Who is it?  Bobo, can I talk to them?  No, all right, didn't problem, all right. 
[03:17:30]  Was that your mom?  No, that was my brother.  Oh.  Oh, him and his brother having a union later.  No, no, he was twisting what I was saying.  Oh.  On stage.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, he was twisting, that was a separate thing.  I was saying, I was meeting my, my brother after the show, after the show.  And you, you're going to have sex with him without a condom.  No, I didn't say that.  On stage.  On stage.  He said that?  No, I didn't say that.  No, Bobo.  I did not say that.  I did not say.  But it's, but it's his half brother, so it's not, it's, it's not weird. 
[03:18:00]  I did not say that.  Johnny said you said it.  Oh, fuck, Johnny.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Sam said what.  Sam was twisting what I was saying.  Sam would never twist anything.  Is that what he said?  That's what he said.  He was twisting what I was saying.  Everybody was twisting, twisting what I'm saying.  Hey, Bobo, would you fuck him in that 88 Mustang?  They're twisting what I'm saying.  What would that, what would that sound like?  I ain't going to comment there, all right?  I'm not. 
[03:18:30]  It comes, he's on the leather seats.  Don't mess up the leather seats.  David here was twisting what I'm saying.  David, what are you doing?  What happened?  David, why are you instigating?  Yeah.  I'm not instigating anything.  I'm just telling what happened.  He's twisting what I'm saying because he heard the way, because the way I talk, maybe it  sounds different.  No, it doesn't sound different at all.  It's not the way you talk.  No, you're doing it on stage, right, Bobo?  No, I didn't say that.  At the Stress Factory.  I didn't say that.  I was saying I was introducing Rich Voss on stage.  Did you?  Oh, yeah? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Jesus, these two are a movie.  I'm introducing.  Wait, wait, wait.  The real thing's happening.  I'm introducing Rich Voss tonight.  At the Stress Factory?  Yeah, Vinny asked me to introduce Voss.  And talk to the crowd a little bit?  Yeah, I'm going to talk to them.  And I got to...  You're having sex with your brother?  No, no, no.  Half brother.  Sorry.  Wait, wait, wait.  You want to practice what you're going to do for Rich Voss tonight?  Yeah, I'm getting...  Well, I'm already saying...  How about someone introduce Bobo?  Let's go through this.  Right. 
[03:19:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, crowd, welcome to the Stress Factory here in New Brunswick.  Ladies and gentlemen, crowd?  Well...  Wait, wait.  Let's start over.  All right.  I'm going to say welcome.  Ladies and gentlemen, your headliner tonight is Rich Voss.  But first, from the Opie and Anthony show, it's Bobo.  Wait.  Ladies and gentlemen, from 18 New Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You all know me as Bobo.  All right, let's try it again.  You all know me as Bobo.  Ladies and gentlemen, your headliner tonight is Rich Voss. 
[03:20:00]  But first, from the Opie and Anthony show, let's give a warm welcome to Bobo.  Good evening, New Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm amazed you all made it here in this tough economy.  Did you guys screw up some stockholder to come here today?  Did you guys screw up some stockholder?  I know you're all here to see a fag bag carrying Rich Voss.  So without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to me. 
[03:20:30]  No, no, no, no.  You've got to do a little more time than that.  Oh, my God.  A little more time.  I understand you're all here.  I understand you're all here to see me.  All right, hold on.  We'll start over again.  Ladies and gentlemen, your headliner tonight, Rich Voss.  But first, from the Opie and Anthony show, let's hear it for Bobo.  Good evening, New Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  How'd you all came here in this tough economy?  Did you guys screw over any stockholders?  That's the same thing.  I can't believe you guys.  Some stockholder is very pissed off at you, wants to probably beat you up. 
[03:21:00]  If you're some corporate guy who screwed over a stockholder, if they fine you, your ass is probably going to get kicked.  Me, I can't believe I got here, taking two trains to get here.  Of course, I noticed, though, your trains are pretty clean, unlike the Long Island Railroad.  I see people smell like alcohol on those trains. 
[03:21:30]  I have to say, though, Rich Voss, the guy, I can't believe this guy's wearing a fur coat and a fag bag.  So, who here wants a Bobo Springsteen song here that's from Jersey?  Me, me, me, me.  All right, I don't know if you're from Jersey.  Well, you're not really from Jersey, but just for all intents and purposes, say you are from Jersey. 
[03:22:00]  Okay, I'm from Jersey.  You're on a fair play.  He thinks he's a wrestler.  He kicked a porn star husband's ass in a boxing match.  And after he wins tonight's boxing match, he's going to screw a dead drunk Lindsay Lohan.  Oh, wah, wah, wah.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, that's terrific.  And now, without further ado, Rich Voss.  And without further ado, the Jew with the right amount of stupidity and the smile of a horse, 
[03:22:30]  give it up for your own, New Jersey's own, Rich Voss.  Wow.  And then, of course, Voss walks on stage.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't sure of that.  Oh, I thought you just stood there.  I was just describing what would happen after that, and then I'd probably shake his hand, whatever,  and then he does his thing.  How would the crowd react to you afterwards, like after the show's over and they're coming up to you?  Are there more people coming up to you or Voss? 
[03:23:00]  Well, I don't know.  Probably both of us, but probably at this rate, because sometimes what I hear about Voss' act,  will probably be coming up to me more often.  Whoa.  Believe me.  My Twitter followers are in the hundreds.  Whoa.  Wow.  Bring up my Twitter stat.  Can somebody bring up my Twitter stats?  What?  Twitter stats?  It's like a baseball card.  No, I'm talking about the information about how many followers I got. 
[03:23:30]  You got 368.  You're the new Brady Spears.  Mr. Met 8 on Twitter.  He's M-R-Met 8.  It's Mr. like M-R-M-E-T and the number 8.  Heading toward 400, Bo.  Yep, that's right.  I get fans all the time.  Ever since I advertised my Twitter on the radio, they've been following.  You know what they say.  It's like that Field of Dreams.  If you advertise it, they will follow.  Wait, what is that from the Field of Dreams? 
[03:24:00]  I was imitating that line in Field of Dreams, but I was saying it as a Twitter reference.  Oh, and what was it?  If you advertise your Twitter on the O&A show, they will follow.  Holy shit.  So was Mr.  You can't even look.  Was Mr. Met 1 through 7 taken?  Yeah.  Why 8?  Yeah, why 8?  The number on my Mets jersey when I was a kid?  Jersey. 
[03:24:30]  Who was number 8 when you were a kid?  That was Gary Carter back in the 80s.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  I was actually at game 6 when I was age 4.  He had the nice permed mullet.  I sat in a mezzanine, the upper levels of the mezzanine, the upper part of the mezzanine.  Mezzanine.  Mezzanine.  For those of you who don't know what Shea Stadium looks like, there were seating sections  of the field level was orange, the level above that was blue, and the level above that 
[03:25:00]  was the mezzanine, and the one above that was red.  The green seats.  It was Continental Airlines.  The green seats.  The green seats was the mezzanine section, the third level, the third seating level of  Shea Stadium.  He knows everything about Shea Stadium.  Well, I have to.  I'm a Mets fan.  Well, it's gone now.  It doesn't sound like good seats.  Why are you bragging?  Yeah, mezzanine.  Well, it was what was around at the time, right?  It was the stadium the Mets played at the top. 
[03:25:30]  It was the stadium the Mets played at the top.  Here we go.  Johnny, a little tune-up fight here.  I brought my boxing gloves.  That was my team's stadium at the time, so that's where you go.  But that new stadium is freaking awesome.  All right.  Fair play.  Would you let Bobo hit you a few times with the gloves?  No, I hit him.  How about one-to-one?  I don't want my brother to see bruised faces when he hasn't seen me in 23 years.  23 years.  And they are having sex later. 
[03:26:00]  No, that isn't true.  No, no, no.  That's these guys twisting that line.  No, he wouldn't do that.  He wouldn't do that to you, Bobo.  Hey, would you fuck your brother to get that Mustang?  How about rub one out?  What do you think?  Well, that...  That's a tough question.  It is an 88 Cobra.  If the price was right...  If the price was right...  88 Cobra, that's the price.  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  We got Sam on CNBC.  I got it right here.  It really is?  It's a new generation, so that's great.  Blackberry is yesterday, and iPhone is now.  You see where they cut that...  Yeah.  Where the sound cuts out?  Yeah.  Do you know what the visual is?  What?  Me chanting 3GS at the top of my lungs, but they cut the audio out.  So I'm just sitting there screaming with my arms in the air, but there's no sound.  Well, there's one thing I got to say, though, and Anthony probably agrees with me on this  one.  Oh, I do.  Mel, improve the app. 
[03:27:00]  Please show some better respect for ONA.  They already did that.  They did.  Look at how they fucking...  He was out there mocking the whole thing, and then they just...  I mean, that's completely dishonest.  They made it to make it look like he was a supporter and gave a shit.  I was holding my Blackberry.  Right.  That was fake.  That whole thing was fake, and they put it on as news.  Yeah.  I didn't buy an iPhone, and I still have my Blackberry, and I'll be using it for the  rest of the contract.  Yeah, the Blackberry is better or whatever. 
[03:27:30]  You had all the pro Blackberry lines in there.  And they knew it, because they had all your footage, so they knew that it was bullshit,  but they used it as real news.  That's what they do.  Did they ask you what the apps was?  No, that's mine.  They can't have that.  They get up, what's the app?  And they probably...  And I bet you the new iPhone, they probably throw in a stylist.  If you're an executive producer with too big of a fingers...  A stylist?  For your hair?  No, for people with too big fingers.  What would a stylist be sold with the iPhone? 
[03:28:00]  For executive producers that have fingers that are too big.  But a stylist is for your hair.  No, I'm talking about that pen thingy, you know, like Steve.  I was making a joke about Steve.  Oh, what are those things called?  It's called a stylist.  Bears.  Remember he said the reason he uses a...  No, we don't.  Remember the reason...  Well, if you heard the reason he said he uses a stylist is because his hands are too big  to press the button, so he has to use a stylist still.  Hey, is your brother here right now?  No, he's gonna... 
[03:28:30]  No, he's gonna...  I'm gonna see him after the show.  Oh, okay.  And why haven't you seen each other in so long?  Well, he's got a...  Well, we only share the same father.  And when my father passed away, his mother didn't let him see me anymore.  Why?  For some reason, I don't know.  She took it out on my father and decided to take it out on the kids.  You know how some people are.  Jesus.  Was there underage touching?  Was that...  No.  For some reason, she was just pissed off at my father and somehow was blaming my mother 
[03:29:00]  for it.  Oh, that's...  She had a grudge against my mother.  Who?  The new mom?  I'm kind of confused.  No, no, no, no, no, she's talking about the lady, the woman my father married after he  divorced her.  You're a little confused with the whole thing.  My father had a marriage prior to my mother.  Is that the one you want to have sex with? 
[03:29:30]  No.  It's his brother he wants to have sex with.  The brother.  No, half brother, damn it.  And don't ignore these guys.  They're twisting what I'm saying.  All right.  Bobo, walk us through it slowly.  My father had a previous marriage prior to my mother.  Right.  And they had that kid, Brian.  That you're going to meet for the first time today in 23 years.  Yeah.  That I've only been talking to on the internet.  Okay.  So how do you know you already know you want to fuck him?  No, no, no, no, no.  You never met him.  They're twisting that.  I didn't say that part. 
[03:30:00]  Is he down for this or is it just you?  No, I didn't say the effing part, all right?  I'm going to...  You're going to force yourself on your own brother.  No, no, no, no.  I hope he's into this.  Don't make me call him right now.  Don't make me call him right now.  If you guys hear you've been twisting what I've been saying.  Dude, that's going to be awkward, man.  That's going to be awkward.  Call, call, call, call, call, call.  Call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call.  I'll talk to him.  Are you going to make the first move?  Yeah, have Johnny talk to him.  Yeah, I'd love to talk to him.  We're getting everything.  I'm not going to call him here, all right?  I don't want...  I don't want this ruined, all right? 
[03:30:30]  The first time I've seen him in years ruined.  You're really excited.  You've got to say that in...  Yeah, you're aroused.  I don't want this ruined.  No, I can tell he's excited because...  You don't want us cock-blocking.  The nice shirt, the fucking hair, no med hat.  Yeah, the moose.  Why?  You're hoping to have a relationship with him?  Yeah.  No, no.  We won't cock-block you.  No, no, I didn't say that, all right?  It's just I thought that this would be appropriate to wear a button shirt and a...  When is it ever appropriate to fuck your brother? 
[03:31:00]  No, I didn't say that.  And what's the deal with the ping-pong balls and the asshole?  You were talking about that, too.  I didn't say that.  You did, too?  I did not say that.  I guess I heard you, Bobo.  You said your brother could fart out ping-pong balls out of his asshole.  No, I didn't say that.  Oh, Bobo got hurt.  I did not say that.  I said I could probably do that.  Bobo, I found you.  I would knock the hat off Johnny's fair play.  That's it.  Knock off his hat.  Knock off his hat.  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Oh!  Damn. 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Would you like to give me that back now?  Uh-oh, pre-fight hype.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  I'll give it back to you after Jimmy Furt's in it.  Who's Jimmy?  Jimmy's not even here.  Jimmy's not here.  Yeah, well, I'm holding on to it until the next time he's here.  Then you'll get it back.  Furt it on.  Oh!  I'm going to ship it.  Holy shit.  I'm shipping it to you.  Priority mail.  Same day.  Priority mail.  Same day.  Furt it on.  I'm going to have him fart it on multiple times. 
[03:32:00]  Oh!  Multiple times fart it on.  I'm going to have him eat.  I'll give Jimmy the 100 case of White Castle sliders.  What?  The 100 case of White Castle sliders.  I'm saying, Jimmy, I didn't need to fart on this multiple.  Well, when he is here, I'm holding on to this until he's, until it's farted on.  Bobo, I'm going to punch you in the stomach if you don't give him.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  No, no, no. 
[03:32:30]  Now Bobo doesn't know what to do.  Don't make me do that.  You do that.  I got...  I know lawyers.  I do, too.  Ask Bonaduce.  I don't like your chances.  Bonaduce ain't a lawyer.  He's a where are they now guy.  Oh!  That guy is the actor that played Danny Partridge.  Not a lawyer.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  A little trivia.  A little trivia question. 
[03:33:00]  I wouldn't know, because that's how, that's part of the way my mother kind of came up  with the name, my name.  Oh!  Oh, okay.  I'm honestly going to put on the boxing glove and punch you in the stomach if I don't have  my hat back.  In what time?  You're going to put a time frame on it.  Well, if you do that, I'm going to...  I'm not going to explain why my brother...  Johnny Fairplay is going for the glove.  Stand your ground, Bobo.  Johnny, show him what's what.  You did it go UFC and me. 
[03:33:30]  No, this isn't UFC.  This is just boxing.  These are 18-ounce gloves.  He's just going to punch you.  Yeah, he's just going to punch you.  You going to take that, Bobo?  Bobo.  Stand your ground, Bobo.  Stand your ground.  Johnny, this is great pre-fight hype.  Yeah, right.  Bobo, put your hand up.  I want to do this to Sam.  I'm a little disappointed.  Bobo, defend yourself.  Glasses are off.  They're in his hat.  He's taking off the headphones.  He's looking at me.  I'm not going full strength, 
[03:34:00]  but I'm going to go under him.  I don't want this guy injured for the fight.  I'd like to see this guy kick Mr. Lohan's ass.  So you're not going to hurt him.  Bobo, put your dukes up.  You don't want to hurt the guy before the main event.  Here we go.  Dukes are up.  Dukes are up.  I'm just going to punch you in the stomach, all right?  Dukes are up.  Dukes are up.  Dukes are up.  Dukes are up.  You ready?  You ready?  Okay, here we go.  Oh, shit.  What'd you do?  All right, stop.  Oh, shit.  Jesus, Fairplay.  Fairplay laid into Bobo so hard. 
[03:34:30]  Bobo, you all right?  He was a little bit of a piece.  Oh, there's a chin to the face.  That's another one.  That's a gun for the face.  All right, they're trying to hold Bobo back.  Terry's trying to hold him back.  Bobo's punching Johnny Fairplay.  Oh, my God.  It's a catastrophe.  Fairplay is down.  Bobo.  Bobo, fight back.  Don't just...  Not Bobo.  Bobo.  I think you're good.  I think you better quit while you're behind.  Wow. 
[03:35:00]  You're fucking well done.  He was going right for the face, too, wasn't he?  What the fuck?  Jesus.  I like your style, Bobo, but still, I don't like your chances, but I like your style.  It's very girl-like.  Like, what the fuck?  He has his knuckle.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to break a knuckle if you push that way.  I don't normally get into fights, apparently.  Really?  No, you abnormally get into fights.  That's so weird.  That was something.  So is this what we can expect, what is it, Friday night or Saturday? 
[03:35:30]  Saturday, June 20th, Philadelphia Airport, Ramada.  It's...  How old is Michael Lohan?  49.  So, like, I issued an open challenge I made on TMZ and all that, and I was like, I'll  fight any celebrity under 160 pounds with no fight experience.  So, Michael Lohan accepted.  I saw he has three years...  He's had three fights he's already done.  He's 170 pounds.  He's 5'10".  I'm just like, fuck me.  But I've been training for, like, three weeks, so I feel pretty good. 
[03:36:00]  You'll beat him.  You'll beat him.  Jesus, Bobo.  Bobo, how's your...  How are you on his side after he punched you that hard?  He just hit me right here.  Oh, how is that?  Is it bruised?  It hurt.  Let's see.  Lift it up.  You all right?  I'm all right.  Was it a good punch, Bobo?  It was good, all right?  It's just the stuff you twisting what I said kind of got to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I kick his ass a little.  Believe me, you were ruining me seeing my brother for the first time in ages. 
[03:36:30]  Well, you're going to ruin your brother if you have sex with him.  No, I'm not.  Oh, shit.  Again, you guys are twisting what I'm saying.  Again, you guys are twisting what I'm saying.  Don't make him have to defend his honor again.  Yeah.  I'll put the gloves back on, Bobo.  Bobo kicked your ass with those face shots.  It's only fair.  Let Bobo hit you once with the glove.  He punched me in the face without the glove.  I think we're even right now.  I said I'm not ruining someone right before the big fight, all right? 
[03:37:00]  It's safe to say that he's not going to do much damage.  There's people that pay money.  Bobo, you want to punch him once with the glove on?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  How much money will people pay to see you fight, see you kick the ass of Michael Lohan?  How much money?  We got microphones.  Yeah, right.  Can someone tell me how much money were those tickets?  Bobo, you only get to punch him once in the arm.  And just in the arm.  How much money?  First ask me.  How much money were the best seats going for?  Not in the face.  I have no clue. 
[03:37:30]  Not in the face.  Once in the arm.  You're fighting in this and you don't know how much money your own fight's going for?  No idea.  Right here.  Not in the face.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Someone's thinking the Rocky music for this one.  That's right.  All right.  Rocky Dennis.  Rocky Dennis.  That's not bad, Bobo.  He's got a good jab.  That's better than what he had before.  Absolutely.  Would you like one more punch back, Bobo?  Don't fuck me.  They hit this so much.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Jesus.  Right, not the one I write with. 
[03:38:00]  Okay.  All right, all right.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That was a good one.  That was a good hit.  I'm going to have some stuff to tell my brother after this.  Yeah, Johnny Fair played like a box wig.  Yeah.  Like I wear a condom?  No, no, no, no.  He's not using condoms.  He's doing the trolley neck condom gimmick.  Yeah.  Bobo, you shouldn't try to fuck your brother up.  You really shouldn't.  When I was a teenager, when I was asleep, I'd wear one because I did have the pants jizzing  problem.  I used to jizz in my pants. 
[03:38:30]  Who hasn't jizzed in their pants when they were asleep?  Wait a minute.  Who wears pants when they were asleep?  You wore a condom when you went to sleep?  Because I used to jizz in my pants when I was asleep.  All right, wait.  Explain this.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  You know, when you have those dreams, when you have some kind of dream that you're at.  Sex dreams.  Sure.  Yeah, when you're at a dream.  How about your brother?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Fossil family reunion one day.  No, no, no. 
[03:39:00]  Not that.  I'm talking about when I'm effing some broad in high school.  Whoa.  Yeah.  When I was in high school, I'd be effing some broad.  You know, that hot looking chick.  Whoever it was, you were eyeing, but you probably could never hook up with as much as you try  to ask.  You'd get turned down.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's happened to you.  I think you said you were kind of more of the class clown with what you could do.  Yes.  Thank you, Bobo.  I was.  So what happened, Bobo?  Exactly.  Most of the time that would happen.  You'd have to dream and all of a sudden you'd wake up and it was, oh shit, I jizzed in my 
[03:39:30]  pants.  So you started wearing a condom to bed?  Yeah.  I kept discreet that I wore them, but I had a case hidden.  A case of condom.  So you didn't have to jizz in your pants anymore.  So you'd go to bed and roll on a condom?  No.  No, I'd wear it in my sleep and if I accidentally jizzed in my pants, I knew it wouldn't get  in my pants, but it would get in the condom, of course.  Oh, that's what it does.  How many times would you wake up with a full condom? 
[03:40:00]  I lost count.  A lot, huh?  Damn.  No, maybe in a, I think it was maybe in a double digits.  And your parents never saw the condom?  No.  Are you sure you weren't just peeing in your pants?  No, I know what peeing is, all right?  He tasted it.  He knows.  No, no, no, no.  It tasted your cough.  No, I never tasted your cough.  Nice.  No, no, no.  What does it taste like, Bobo?  I don't know what people think.  I've never 69'd myself before.  But you tried, right?  No, I never tried. 
[03:40:30]  Bobo, what's the difference between...  You could actually just six yourself.  The only reason I know is because I've had urinary system problems.  48 operations on my urinary system.  It's like a cat.  Why 48 operations?  They messed up an operation on my urinary system.  Oh, shit, Bobo.  When I was just two years old, they messed up an operation.  Circumcision gone wrong?  No, no.  Actually, they never...  Actually, I've never been circumcised because of the operations.  Oh!  Okay.  What's the difference between cum and pee? 
[03:41:00]  It's simple.  Yeah?  It's...  Pee is probably yellow.  Pee is yellow, Bobo.  Probably.  No, no.  It is yellow, depending on what...  Depending on what kind of fluids was consumed.  Would you say not as salty, Bobo?  Probably not as salty.  No, I've never...  I've only heard.  I've only heard.  I've only heard.  Right.  What kind of sex dreams did you have?  Oh, where I was always effing some broad.  In what way? 
[03:41:30]  Like, what...  Explain it.  From the boardies.  I don't remember.  I just remember...  Effing some broad.  I just remember all of a sudden when I've been...  Almost, like, wake up almost as soon as I was boning the broad.  I all of a sudden wake up and notice it that I, uh...  I was, for some reason, almost like...  You know that thing you say where you always try to control what happens in your dream?  Yeah.  Like, I try to stop it because I know, oh my god, I'm gonna wake up just...  With just my pants.  I'm gonna wake up like that.  And I try to stop it, but then it couldn't...  It couldn't control it because you can't really...  You try to... 
[03:42:00]  It's hard to control stuff when you're asleep.  So, you pull out your dreams?  I've tried to before, but it couldn't.  I don't know.  I tried to, but you couldn't.  I couldn't.  I don't know.  I had...  So, you'd put it in and just cum, right?  I don't know.  I had this crazy...  I don't know.  The last time it's happened...  I don't know why.  I didn't even know you guys yet.  But for some reason, I recall the chick looked like... 
[03:42:30]  The last time I remember it happened, this was like in the 90s, but for some reason,  that part looked quite like Lily from the Ron and Fizz show.  Oh!  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Sometimes I've had dreams predict like maybe people I know.  Sometimes, yeah.  I've had dreams that predict maybe places I'd end up going to...  Really?  ...that I've never been, but all of a sudden I wound up going to that place.  Gay bar?  No, no, no! 
[03:43:00]  Brother's taint?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  My brother has a lemon in his taint.  That's cool.  No, I didn't say that.  Don't say that, all right?  I've got to...  If you say that one more time, I've got to...  If you're trying to twist what I'm saying, I don't think you want to upset my brother,  all right?  I can only imagine.  Believe me, my brother...  My brother, he describes himself as my space.  ...as his appearance as an athletic appearance. 
[03:43:30]  Cute.  Yeah.  Oh, you like that.  No, I didn't say that.  I said that's how he describes himself in his my space.  Yeah.  Which I ain't giving away.  Are you wearing a condom now?  No.  Just thinking about it?  You brought some.  Oh, shit.  Did you choose your pants?  No, I haven't had that jizz in my pants problem since...  I don't know.  I think since the...  Hours?  26?  No.  The Clinton administration.  Bases a time on just the presidential administration. 
[03:44:00]  You've missed out on a lot of jizz.  That's a buffer there.  An eight-year...  That's an eight-year buffer.  The only time that happens is...  Where's all this jizz going if it's not going into your pants anymore?  Someone acts...  Simple.  My cousin places the porn film on...  Puts on a porn film on full blast when I'm asleep just to prank me.  So you've hooked up with your cousin, too?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I didn't say that.  No. 
[03:44:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I did not say that.  I did not say...  If you can't keep it in your pants, keep it in the family.  No.  I don't do that.  Again, you twisted.  Again, you twisted what I said.  Again, you people twisted what I said.  Oh.  I just think it's the New York accent, I guess.  Why is your cousin...  Yeah.  Your cousin is putting on a porno really loud because he's hoping that you're going to knock on his door.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  Tap.  Tap.  No, because when I was younger, he used to think it was funny to prank me.  What would he do? 
[03:45:00]  Well, that's one of the things I described.  He popped the...  Boner?  No.  He popped the porno in the VCR one time.  Pop your cheery asshole.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  What I described.  Last thing I poured a full blast and I wound up jizzing in my pants.  So, Bobo, I'm very confused.  How many...  How many...  I know you...  I'm confused.  How many members of your family have you had sex with at this point?  None.  Brother? 
[03:45:30]  Cousin?  No.  Brother?  Cousin?  Dead father?  No.  No.  No.  No.  None.  It's a bullish day coming up.  As a matter of fact, I could say that I'm a virgin.  Oh.  For the right...  But I do want to lose it, though.  He's a virgin for women.  So who do you want to fuck you in the ass?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, anything altogether.  You guys, you guys are getting it.  I'm a virgin from anything.  You're getting it wrong.  Bobo has not had sex with his brother.  He is going to have sex with his brother.  No, no, no, no, no, I did not say that. 
[03:46:00]  Right.  I did not even say that.  Sorry, Bobo.  I did not even say that.  23 years in the making.  Bobo, you look...  I did not even say that, Sam.  Yes, you did.  I did not say that.  I did not say that.  Your words.  Your words.  No, no, no, no, no.  Someone twisted my words because of the way I sounded when I said what I...  Bobo, why don't you text Sam?  You seem like you have heat with Chubby Checker.  Everybody's twisting around you.  Yeah, look at that.  You're talking about his hands?  No, no, I mean they're screwing up what I said. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, that's what you mean by twisting.  I don't have texting on his phone.  It costs so much on the bill.  It costs money.  The economy's garbage.  You can't text him.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What did I got to say?  David, you're a badass brother fucker, David.  Oh, shit.  Why?  What did I do, Bobo?  No, no, no, he was trying...  He didn't like a brother like you.  No, no, no, no.  I'm reading this because Danny here thought that he was trying to twist what I was saying,  so I just said, I'm getting back at him by saying that to someone else. 
[03:47:00]  Oh!  I heard you, Bobo.  Sam!  You were also talking about your uncle.  I bet you you're...  How about we have Bobo and David fight?  One boxing glove each.  Yeah.  Opie, one boxing glove each.  I like it.  I thought you got to say, Sam.  David, you want to box Bobo?  Sam, Sam, I bet your younger siblings use your afro to jack off.  Use your afro as a hairy pussy.  That was decent. 
[03:47:30]  That was decent.  That's not bad.  Although you would lose the bet because they do not.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm sure somebody would use that.  I'm sure if one of your brothers got really drunk and just started to jack off,  he would think your afro was the hairiest pussy.  He would think he wound up in a DeLorean and wound up in his 70s and there's some chick  with a hairy pussy, but it would be your hair.  You lost me, Bobo.  All right, listen, Johnny Fairplay, what's the big plug?  Because we have two minutes before they cut us off for Ron and Fez.
