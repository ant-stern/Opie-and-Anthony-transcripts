<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio broadcast opened with a celebratory discussion of their successful Atlanta live shows.  Jimmy Norton, present in the studio, recounted hilarious anecdotes from the tour, including a poorly handled construction noise complaint at the Doubletree Suites and the overwhelmingly positive response from fans, some traveling from as far as Alabama and South Georgia.  Listeners called in to share their own enthusiastic experiences, mentioning the "ONA Party Rock" chants and encounters with fellow fans reciting show lines in various accents.  The hosts also discussed strong merchandise sales, particularly of their "WoW" stickers, with one listener recounting a successful sticker sales event at one of the shows.  The positive reception was contrasted with their less successful St. Patrick's Day event. Technical difficulties with the studio microphones were a recurring, frustrating element throughout the broadcast.

Anthony detailed his own frustrating experiences with the Atlanta hotel, escalating to a near-violent confrontation with staff.  The future of the show, including the possibility of a return to terrestrial radio on K-Rock, was briefly discussed. The show was peppered with vulgar and sexually suggestive jokes.  Later segments included discussion of a fight witnessed outside the Hard Rock Cafe during an autograph signing, an eBay auction for Anthony's uneaten chicken pot pie, and a brief phone call with Patrice O'Neal. The broadcast concluded with plans for future live events, including potential trips to Boston and Canada, and strong negative reactions to news reports regarding protestors at soldiers' funerals.


The show then shifted to recollections of past road shows, focusing on a notorious Buffalo event involving a beach, strippers, and zucchinis, detailing the massive turnout and subsequent legal issues.  Further potential road show locations and the possibility of arrest in Buffalo due to lingering rumors were discussed.  A recent altercation at a diner involving Opie, his brother Elmo, and a man over a ketchup bottle was recounted in detail by Elmo via phone call. This was followed by a discussion of an upcoming, less controversial book reading event.  A large portion of the show was dedicated to a critical, often profane, analysis of a recent *Sopranos* episode, with the hosts and numerous callers expressing frustration with the show's perceived shift away from mob violence towards symbolism and dream sequences.  Opie detailed his own frustrating experience with furniture delivery in Manhattan, further highlighting the everyday struggles of city life.  Elmo contributed a highly profane karaoke performance of "Centerfold" from a recent live show, which was discussed and briefly played on air. A caller's T-shirt design was briefly mentioned, alongside plugs for merchandise on opianthony.com and myradiostore.com.


A later segment began with Anthony’s angry rant about Long Island traffic, contrasting the "real" issues with politicians focusing on trivial matters like video games. This segued into Anthony's frustrating experiences with a delayed furniture delivery,  culminating in an aggressive phone call with the furniture company which resulted in a new delivery and a discount. The conversation then turned to a news story about a fatal accident involving a van of Chinese swimmers, followed by a discussion of Anthony's celebrity-aided escape from a speeding ticket for cell phone use.  Other news stories covered included a professor using rap to teach about slavery, and Tom Cruise's attempt to censor a *South Park* episode. The hosts encouraged listeners to illegally download *Mission Impossible 3* in response. An angry trucker called in to dispute a generalization about truckers. The segment concluded with a musical interlude of Anthony singing "Sweet Caroline."


The final segment began with a discussion of a new artist's song about illegal burning and record company practices, followed by movie recommendations (including *V for Vendetta*). A caller, George, reported that a local radio station playing a clip from a previous Opie and Anthony broadcast led to increased website traffic.  This led to a discussion about Isaac Hayes' departure from *South Park* and his perceived contradictory statements. A caller, Chris, who had been on hold for three hours, discussed playing *City of Heroes*. The conversation then shifted back to the *South Park*/Scientology feud and Tom Cruise. A graphic and humorous description of a moose riding in a car after a collision ensued, followed by further discussions of online gaming deaths and a man who severed his penis and threw it at police officers.  Extended discussion covered Jimmy Norton’s stand-up career, his appearance on Louis C.K.'s HBO show, and an anecdote about Louis C.K. confronting poorly performed Henson puppets.  The moose story was revisited with audio from a news report. The show ended with a final caller and concluding remarks.  Beyond the regular hosts, no specific guests were in studio.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We didn't get fired. 
[00:04:00]  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Can I just say fuck?  Can I just say fuck?  Yes.  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new climate of radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  Opie, your big, beautiful, beautiful. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I say the awful, terrible things in my life  and turn it into something funny.  This is great ice tea.  You dick.  Oh, those guys are bad.  It's not a tumor. 
[00:05:30]  Stop whining.  Stop it.  I'll be back.  There is no bathroom.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  I'm a cop, you idiot.  And of course, Dylan.  Good old Dylan.  Dylan.  Good old Dylan.  Dylan.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:06:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  That's getting more and more apparent, isn't it?  That it is indeed spreading.  We got proof of that, actually.  Jimmy Norton back in studio.  He played Atlanta all weekend long.  And the people are coming out in droves, right?  Shit, man.  I really, really was surprised at how good the response was in Atlanta.  I mean, your mic's low.  My mic's low. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, something's a little odd.  God damn it!  We just want a broadcast.  How does it get fucked up when it was fine?  I thought it was me, so I turned up the headphones.  Look how far my headphones are up, just so I can hear myself.  And then Jimmy starts talking, and you're like, yeah.  Is that low right there?  Is it okay?  It sounds a little better now, to be honest with you.  What is going on with the mics now?  I don't know.  Every so often, they feel they have to fuck them up.  Like, they could be fine.  They're rolling along fine. 
[00:07:00]  For months, the mics were fine.  And then someone decides, hey, let me just throw a monkey wrench into the show and fuck  it up for no apparent reason.  Because there's no reason I could even think of why someone would fuck our mics up.  No one amazes me.  There are people that think they know better than us.  No one knows better than us!  We know everything.  We know everything about this business.  Stop trying to help us out.  I got a weird thing going on where my right headphone is just a tad louder than my left. 
[00:07:30]  That's why I was doing this before the show started.  I saw that.  And not too distracting.  And it's a little odd.  You know, it's hard enough to...  I'm broadcasting, like, sideways.  I'm tilting.  I understand.  It's hard enough to, you know, make what you say interesting.  Yes!  Without having...  It is!  Without having technical problems to deal with.  Interesting.  Even if everything was working perfectly...  Right.  ...it's still hard to make this shit sound like something.  Right.  So we don't need... 
[00:08:00]  We don't need technical problems.  Glitches.  We don't need glitches.  No glitches.  Now it sounds...  It sounds better.  No, we're just getting used to it.  You think?  How's Jimmy?  How's the mic?  How's that?  That's how I talk.  Now you sound much better.  I don't know.  Maybe it was because of the music and I was talking quiet.  Hopefully it works.  No, but that has never been a problem before.  But that's what I'm thinking, too.  Because the music was part of the whole mix.  Well, we had to put the new RL-1002 filter in.  Oh, you did?  Why?  Because someone ordered it because they wanted to justify their job. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Oh, is that why?  And then someone installed it because that job has to be justified.  Oh, okay.  I see how this works now.  You know why you couldn't hear me?  I'm soft-spoken.  You are.  I'm gentle.  No one knows more than us.  We know it all.  Thank you.  So Atlanta was fantastic, man.  I could not believe...  It was good to get a test for a place that we were never on before to go and see how the response was.  I walk out the first night.  They said that's really good for a Thursday. 
[00:09:00]  It wasn't sold out, but it was a really nice crowd for a Thursday night.  And the emcee made a mistake.  A lot of people say Opie and Andy.  Even though they know it's Anthony, it's...  It comes out that way.  I'm thinking of just changing my name to Opie.  It's the Opie and Opie show.  So she goes, Opie and Andy.  And I walk out and I go, yeah, it's good to be here from the Opie and Andy show.  And the place explodes.  I couldn't...  I figured like, you know, a few people, four people would enjoy, ah, you.  He was more out of annoyance than anything. 
[00:09:30]  You sure there isn't an Opie and Andy show down there and they thought you were from there?  Yes, they probably thought I was.  Maybe that's why you got such a good response.  Yes, they had them bring me on as Aunt Bea.  Oh, man.  You thought he died a few weeks ago.  Jimmy Nuts.  Whatever they do.  And I had a great weekend down there, man.  Every show had a fantastic O&A response.  Yeah.  75% at least of the crowds were opening up today.  I could not believe...  That's great.  ...how much O&A audience showed up. 
[00:10:00]  That's great.  And they couldn't believe it.  They're like, wow, that XM is really good, huh?  You could tell.  And it's hard to describe to people because people ask sometimes how you guys do.  How are you doing with the listeners and stuff and satellite?  And it's hard to give any definitive answers to why we think we're doing good.  But then there's just a feeling and then things like that that you can tell.  Like we were able to tell at N.E.W. when things started really clicking.  And it's the same thing here.  You can kind of tell that things are just really wrong. 
[00:10:30]  Live appearances are just mad houses.  Well, we had over 1,000 people at the Hard Rock Cafe on Friday.  We'll get into that whole discussion soon.  A year ago, you know, when we had our St. Pat's thing, it was great and all.  We had a lot of fun, but there sure as shit wasn't that many people.  No, it was definitely a lot bigger this year.  I got to start bringing a WoW sticker with me just to have them because I sell merch.  I forget to bring them.  People always ask for them.  I just forget to bring them with me.  I got to start doing it.  Actually, a listener was doing a WoW sticker stop at one of your shows.  Oh, they're good.  They should do whatever show.  And said it went over great. 
[00:11:00]  Let's go to Cock Sock from Alabama.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Did you travel from Alabama to see Jimmy?  Yes, I did.  I live right on the border of Alabama and Georgia.  I'm in the military, and I saw young Jimmy up there killing.  It was beautiful.  Thanks, man.  How far is that from the gig?  It took about 100 miles, so it was like an hour and a half.  You did the Smoky and the Bandit run.  Yeah.  Let's see, 100 miles, 40 minutes.  I'm going to check out Jimmy. 
[00:11:30]  Because he's thirsty, dummy.  Very good, Cock Sock.  Yep.  Bye, Angel.  All right.  Let's go to Eric in Atlanta.  Eric.  Hey, boys.  How are you doing this morning?  Hi.  Hey, Jimmy.  I just want to let you know you killed in Atlanta, man.  You were absolutely wonderful.  Oh, thank you, man.  Really, I definitely had a great time.  It's one of the best gigs in the country, Punchline.  Oh, I wanted to find out that Ron Jeremy thing that you do during your bit.  Is that a true story, or is that just a bit that you put on it?  Oh, that old gag.  I love that one.  Atlanta got to hear that one for the first time. 
[00:12:00]  It's beautiful.  That's never been done on TV.  I saved that one.  I'm not stupid.  You don't blow out all your closing bits.  My problem is I've seen Jimmy so much, I've heard that bit maybe 50 times.  That was a spontaneous story.  He came out with it on the spot, Opie.  That old gag.  Here's where I'm at now.  I guess a lot of the celebrity stories you know, there's very few new celebrity stories.  However, there's a lot in the beginning that's very new.  But people in Atlanta most of them know.  Oh, in all fairness, I should say that last time I saw Jimmy, he had all new material. 
[00:12:30]  But the question to answer your question, sir, it's completely true, and I don't add or  subtract anything from the story.  It's absolutely true.  There you go.  I got you.  I have one other thing.  I'm a big supporter of the show, but the people that were screaming out ONA Party Rock throughout  your bit, you know what I mean?  It just kind of took away from the bit.  I kept feeling like the pause, you know, for the cause.  Oh, no.  I just wanted to hear you and people screaming out ONA Party Rock the whole time.  Like I said, I'm a big supporter of the show, but it just kind of took away from me.  You know what?  Actually, I didn't even really notice it.  I'm so used to it in like Philly and Boston, you know what I mean, where it's like they're 
[00:13:00]  complete kooks that a couple of yells here really didn't do anything.  You could say assholes.  No, but I didn't notice it, dude.  I would tell you.  They're complete deuce kooks.  Oh, those geese.  No, I honestly did not really notice it.  I know I did a few Steve from Yellowstones just to call back a joke or whatever, and that  really was very well received.  You don't know how nice that is.  How cool is that?  Oh, it feels so good.  Was the ONA Party Rock done with the southern accent? 
[00:13:30]  It's so fast you can't tell.  They're so, ONA Party Rock!  Yeah, I guess a little bit.  What was the most interesting thing when we were off the air for a couple of years?  I was following Jimmy around the country because I just had to come up with shit to do.  And he went down to Dallas to do his stand-up.  And to see these hardcore Opie and Anthony fans in Dallas reciting all the lines from  the show with this Dallas accent.  I don't know.  I guess it's southern, but it's a Texas accent with their big cowboy hats on and stuff. 
[00:14:00]  And it was so bizarre to me.  Big old belt buckles.  It was so bizarre to me to see what we saw in New York all the time, people, rabid fans  that recite shit to you, but done with a Texas accent.  It was really strange.  It's always weird to hear black people that love the show, too.  Like, I'm always happy, but when I see a black couple in the audience, I'm always surprised  when they're online for merchandise.  Like, oh wow, you guys actually enjoyed it.  Yeah, I think that's great.  It really shows their open-mindedness.  It's hysterical to hear, boom, boom, with a southern accent.  Yeah, right on.  Yeah, Ramon. 
[00:14:30]  Ramon.  Ramon.  Yeah, exactly.  And I had a problem in the hotel.  I stayed at this place.  What was it called?  Double Tree Suites.  And they were doing...  Uh-oh.  I get there, right?  And this is...  Kenny went with me, of course.  Hi.  And he's fucking earnest, efficient.  Yes.  We get there, and there's construction in the hotel.  So Kenny goes, will this be disturbing us?  The construction.  And they're like, no, no, no.  You won't even notice it.  You're on the other side.  Exactly.  The other side of the construction that shakes the entire building. 
[00:15:00]  In the afternoon, I'm trying to doze off.  I get up, I do morning radio.  I'm up at like 6.  And I hear...  It's a fucking jackhammer on the floor above me.  They're only a five-floor little hotel.  You're trying to...  The sleep deprivation, man, is rage-building.  It's amazing.  I had to leave because I was afraid that I was going to do something that was going to get me arrested.  I was going to throw something through the window.  I didn't tinkle on the floor at all.  Believe me, I didn't do that.  I didn't get so angry that I pissed on the floor. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, I would never do that because...  Oh, no.  That would be borderline mentally ill.  It was...  It was...  And here's the angry part.  Double Tree Suites in Atlanta.  Maybe you've stayed there.  Anybody out there who's ever stayed at the Double Tree Suites in Atlanta.  Maybe you've stayed there many times and enjoyed yourself.  I called the manager, and she's so arrogant.  I'm like, look, I'm trying to sleep, and they told us this construction wouldn't bother us.  Well, it's construction.  We don't know where it's going to be. 
[00:16:00]  You don't understand.  I talked to the lady, and she lied to us.  No one lied to you.  I hope...  No one lied to you.  They said that there wasn't going to be...  No one lied to you.  Like, who would accept that they would have construction noises?  Yes, they're going to jackhammer over you.  While you're staying in a hotel, right.  So we left, and I was...  I wanted to bite her face.  I couldn't see her.  A guy, like, almost threw a pen at Kenny.  One of the...  Really, a well-run hotel.  The, uh...  The, uh... 
[00:16:30]  Double Tree.  Double Tree Suites there on Dunwoody Road in Atlanta.  Really well-run hotel, because Kenny's in front of customers asking the German fuck behind  the counter,  What's the name of that manager that was so rude to us?  And the guy told him, and then Kenny's like,  Can I have a pen to write it down?  And the guy just about threw the pen at Kenny,  And Kenny's like,  Thanks for throwing it at me!  And I thought Kenny was going to strangle him.  Ha ha!  Yeah.  So we go to this other place,  And it's a nicer hotel,  And it's, like, relaxing, it's quiet.  And then the next night, 
[00:17:00]  There's fucking Bellman.  It's a 7 o'clock show.  They can't pick us up.  So Kenny's like,  Goes down at 20 o'clock to make sure that the shuttle will be there.  The hotel shuttle, because he's efficient.  Yes.  Kenny's like,  If it's not going to be there, tell me.  We'll have a cab.  And the guy's like,  Nah, it'll be there.  So we go down there, and it's not there.  Of course.  Why would it be there?  Why would it be there?  Why would that balding shit at the Westin Hotel have had the thing?  Why would you, sir?  You can't even keep your hair on.  Why would...  Ha ha!  So...  The shuttle fled like his hair follicles. 
[00:17:30]  Ha ha!  It just...  And decided not to come back.  It just disappeared.  The shuttle was receding.  Ha ha!  And I...  Sometimes he'll brush the shuttle over to the side.  One too many?  All right.  So I, um...  Frustrated.  There's no shuttle, no cab.  It's like 10 after 7 now.  It's a 7 o'clock show.  They call us and say the opening act is in there.  She thinks it's an 8 o'clock show.  So there's the middle, who's this girl, Tig, from L.A., who I love.  And me.  Kenny and I are both livid.  So the guy's like,  Ah!  It's coming soon!  You know, it's not coming soon. 
[00:18:00]  So the French manager comes out.  Ah, French.  And I gotta give the guy...  It wasn't his fault.  He's like,  I'm so sorry.  What can I do?  Uh, the guy...  You see Kenny pointing at him,  and I'm like,  This is not going well.  No.  And the guy comes out,  and Kenny's like,  It was supposed to be here.  The guy's like,  Okay, I will take you.  So the manager of the hotel runs,  gets his car,  fucking spins around.  It's a little teeny.  It looks like a Jaguar,  but it's not.  It's like these new fucking Chevys  that are supposed to look like Caddy's,  but they're not.  They're designed like that.  I don't like it.  I don't either.  Believe me,  you'll never see Chevy Jimmy.  No. 
[00:18:30]  Caddy Jimmy.  Caddy Jimmy.  Caddy Jimmy.  What am I,  a cocksucker?  So I'm standing there with Kenny.  It's so funny.  Now we get in the car,  and the guy's like,  How do I get there?  And Kenny's like,  We don't know.  So it's a big problem.  The guy has to get out of his own car.  He leaves his own car door open.  The shuttle pulls up.  Kenny and I jump out of the car,  walk up to the shuttle,  and Kenny's like,  How do we get to the place?  And the guy's like,  I don't know.  So the manager comes out.  He's asking the shuttle driver.  The shuttle driver has no idea.  Kenny says to the manager,  Drive us in that.  It's bigger.  The guy jumps in, 
[00:19:00]  leaves his own car running  with the fucking car doors open.  Kenny is an intimidating,  uncomfortable,  frightening animal.  Do you understand?  You didn't get a courtesy ride.  He carjacked.  Kenny carjacked the guy.  He told the manager,  Take us to that.  It's bigger.  It's bigger.  The guy jumps in,  leaves his own car open,  speeds out.  The guy is so afraid of Kenny.  Yeah.  And he's driving in a really scary way.  Kenny's like,  We'd like to get there safely.  This isn't Europe.  You can't drive in the left lane. 
[00:19:30]  Club soda Kenny in speed three.  He really,  really takes care of things.  And even when he does take care of things,  sometimes other people's incompetence  will override.  Oh,  yeah.  That's great.  That is great.  Man,  I mean,  you're getting props about the show.  A couple more here.  Half a Hulk nut.  What's up?  What's up,  fellas?  Good to see that.  Well,  he's on Pal Talk,  so you just might see it one day.  What's up,  bro?  We drove from South Georgia,  and man,  that was a damn killer show.  And it made the trip worth it.  Whenever Jim and in the show, 
[00:20:00]  he's like,  This guy drove four hours.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you,  man.  You drove four hours,  right?  That's the key to the story.  Yeah,  right.  Well,  we drove right at four hours.  It made it worth it.  When he was friendly,  took pictures of everybody,  and there was a big,  ass long ride.  You do understand people were driving  from all over to see you,  right,  Jimmy?  Yeah,  from other states and stuff.  Yeah,  the Carolina,  like the close Carolinas,  four hours,  whatever it was.  We really appreciate it,  man.  Thank you.  Let's go to Shannon in Georgia.  Shannon.  Hey,  guys.  Good morning.  Hi,  Shannon.  The only reason I was going here  because I thought you were abroad.  This always sucks.  Shannon thing really throws up.  Because I'll be completely honest, 
[00:20:30]  I'll take you inside the show a little bit,  okay?  We've spent a lot of time on Jimmy  and kicking ass in Atlanta and stuff.  I'm like,  ah,  I might as well take one more from a girl.  That's all I was thinking.  And now that I know you're not a girl,  what could you possibly say  that's going to be fun for the show?  Picture with Jimmy at 7 at the 7 o'clock show Saturday night.  Whoa,  wait a minute now.  Was this before or after the show?  Oh,  I'm sorry.  It was after the show.  I went to the 7 p.m. show.  I thought I was getting a picture with Seva.  Damn it.  All right.  Thank you,  Shannon.  Bye,  Shannon. 
[00:21:00]  Very disappointing.  Girl would have been much better.  Now you know how I feel  when I've made those calls to the services  and then Nicky shows up  and I think it was,  I thought it was CKI.  Let's go to Felix in New Mexico.  Felix.  What's up,  guys?  What's up?  No,  just one of the guys  that I was riding with tonight,  he had an XM radio,  so this is the first time  I ever heard you guys  and listened to you pretty much all night.  I'm about to get off work  and I said,  I thought I'd give you guys a call  and say what's up.  Oh,  you're going to go get XM now? 
[00:21:30]  Well,  I'm thinking about it.  The car that I have  doesn't have any kind of,  you know,  the FM radio in it,  so I can't have an XM to,  you know,  Felix,  I'm going to ask you again.  Are you going to get XM or not?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  There you go.  But,  no,  I'm actually,  I'm in the military in New Mexico  and...  The guy's new,  Opie.  Wagon burner.  I think he was just getting the virus  and you just gave him  some of that antiviral medication 
[00:22:00]  right there.  Take some aspirin,  stupid beat it.  He kind of was getting the virus.  He felt some sniffles  and Opie just cured him.  Yeah.  Now he's gone.  I don't have time  for wishy-washy calls.  That's right.  You're either going to get XM  or you're not.  I'm right.  I'm thinking about it.  You either want to eat all our asses  because you love us so much  or kill yourself.  No way.  That's your choice.  He was thinking about it.  Well,  there you go.  I made your decision  a lot easier.  Go think in the pharmacy,  shithead.  No virus for you.  Let's go to Wagon Burner.  It says,  up all night,  drunk,  waiting to call in. 
[00:22:30]  This should be good.  Wagon Burner.  All right.  Hi, Wagon Burner.  Where have you been?  Well,  we've been waiting  for you, fellas.  Where are you hanging out?  The question is,  where have you been?  Oh, shit.  So,  were you at a bar  or were you just drinking  at a house?  You silly bastard.  We've been waiting  for you, shit.  Come on.  You can't get an answer 
[00:23:00]  for these things.  I know.  Step out of the vehicle, sir.  Sir, sir, sir.  We're in Tucson, Arizona.  Arizona,  so it's still  very early in the morning.  And I actually,  we've been waiting  so long.  I made a list  about subjects  I want to talk  to you guys about  so I wouldn't get  all flustered.  Oh, yeah, you should.  All right.  Hold on.  I've actually been 
[00:23:30]  on XM Radio before.  On the Opie and Anthony show,  you guys may be  familiar with it.  You guys may remember us.  We mentioned  Jimmy's birthday.  Does that ring a bell?  Yeah.  What happened?  Look at this guy.  They're cracking  each other up.  Oh, they certainly are.  It took all night  to think of.  We'll crop that off the list  and we'll keep it rolling.  Anyway,  after we talk to you guys, 
[00:24:00]  we'd appreciate  if you could forward this  back to, you know,  the guys in the director's room  so I could get like  20 or 30  wow stickers.  All right.  Because I need  to come all over town.  So just keep doing it.  All right.  What are some of the other subjects?  We'll put you on hold.  Okay.  What are some of the other subjects?  I'm going, I'm going.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I circled that.  Are you there?  Yes, sir.  Okay.  We're talking about  how great you guys were  and there's a couple  other things  we want to ask you about.  Some other things  that some of the other listeners 
[00:24:30]  were concerned about.  I thought he wrote it down  so he wouldn't get flustered.  I know.  What everyone's worried about  is what's the deal  with the K-Rock deal  and Terrestrial Radio.  Oh, well,  it's kind of at a stalemate  right now.  A stalemate?  Loggerheads.  High five, Loggerheads.  We're, uh...  Yeah.  We'll just...  Work.  Oh, my God.  We got to...  Oh, yeah.  We got to keep these on hold.  Yeah, yeah.  Let him sit there  for a little while  sober up for... 
[00:25:00]  Let him stew.  Yeah, just hang out, guys.  Chris in Alabama,  what's up?  Oh, yeah.  I just want to tell Jimmy  thank you, man.  He killed Thursday night  and thank you  for taking a picture  of my girlfriend.  Thank you.  It's the problem.  I think this is my girl  in line  and he really creeped her out  and I had to warn her  before he went.  I said, listen,  he's a little...  sensitive and a little,  I don't want to say racist,  but she was really surprised  by it.  She really enjoyed it.  I want to say thank you  for taking the time  with the picture.  Thank you.  You know, I'm not racist, man.  I have some racial material,  but we're not racist.  So a black girl  took a picture with Jimmy 
[00:25:30]  and that's a big deal, I guess?  That's his black girlfriend?  Oh, I was kind of freaked out  bringing her there,  you know,  listening to the show  and everything.  It gets a little...  I don't know.  I think I remember you,  a white guy with a black girlfriend  on the Thursday show,  I believe, right?  Yeah.  Okay, I actually do think  I remember that  because you don't see...  Very cool.  You know...  Yeah, I screwed up the...  No, that's right.  I remember the couple  with police protection.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  The blacks love us.  All right, well...  It's because they got  that sense of humor bone  that's higher up in the back.  Yeah.  Well, everyone is calling  just to rave about Jimmy's show, 
[00:26:00]  so...  I didn't like that.  Jimmy, thanks, y'all.  Good job.  I'm hanging up on everybody.  Bye, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's say hi to Scott the Trucker.  Scott!  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, Scott?  Hey, I just wanted to say  that you guys are just awesome.  And Jimmy, that Shannon fella  that called in,  you didn't, like,  practice Monster Rain  with him, did you?  Hello?  We heard you, sir.  Ant's finger was a little  slow on the draw. 
[00:26:30]  No kidding.  Okay.  Hey, why does a shruggy  cry during sex?  Why?  Mace.  Mace.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Lord, I apologize.  All right.  There was one moment  that made me very happy,  and this was, again,  how the crowds are getting  the show.  Some guy in the crowd  said something that was  supposed to be funny,  and it was just such  a classic bomb.  Yeah.  And I just looked at it,  and I went...  And the crowd rolled.  I was so happy they got it.  By the way... 
[00:27:00]  That was great.  That was a trucker.  What we're going to try  to do today,  because we haven't forgotten...  Yep.  I guess the truckers  like to open up their...  their CBs.  The CB radio.  And start telling  all sorts of racist jokes  to each other.  Yeah.  So we want one trucker  to, you know,  set this up for us.  Get it started.  He's got to get on there  and go,  hey out there,  anybody got any jokes?  Right.  Any good jokes?  And then put his cell phone  up to his CB speaker,  and we want to hear  what all the talk is.  We're going to give that a shot. 
[00:27:30]  The scuffle button.  In a little while.  Let's say hi to Doug out Doug.  Doug out.  What's up, guys?  There he is, Doug.  Hey, I apologize to you  after the broadcast.  I didn't see you  until we went off the air,  but I was going to bring you  on stage to get your props.  Oh, are you kidding me?  The attention I got  down there on the floor anyway  was enough to inflate  any ego that was already huge.  Yeah.  Yeah, so Doug worked  in the crowd.  What a fucking great time, man.  Great party.  And congratulations to you guys.  It's kind of weird.  See, we pay attention  to our fan base,  something that Howard  forgot about years ago.  I actually, 
[00:28:00]  after the broadcast,  went to the front of the stage,  and I knew, like,  half the crowd.  I'm like,  this is not normal.  It's not normal  to do a radio show  where you know  half the audience  in attendance.  But you know them  mostly in two-dimensional form  in little two-by-two-inch squares.  Yeah, all the pal-talk girls  came to life  and everybody else,  and I'm sitting there like,  I'm looking around this room  going,  I know so many of these people.  That's not normal.  I couldn't believe  Happy Typing Girl  was actually bigger  than three inches.  I always thought  when I met her,  she'd stand in my hand  and I could just  masturbate looking at her 
[00:28:30]  and threaten to drop her  onto the floor  from way high up.  Anyway.  You fellas had to know  that you were back  and back in style  when you wanted  to eat up  the last 15 minutes  of that show  with nigger jokes  and the last 15 minutes  of the show  was nothing but tits.  You had to know  you were back.  Well, it was a decision  we had to make.  I gotta be honest.  I made the decision  from the stage  because we were ready  to go there  and we had so much fun  last year  and call me a wimp  but Patrice was on stage  and Dr. Ian Smith. 
[00:29:00]  I'm like,  you know what?  These guys are helping us out.  I can't do this  to these guys.  Yeah, you got,  like,  Rachel's jokes are cool  but you don't want  the whole end of the show  to be vicious.  Well, you know.  I mean,  if those guys went backstage  then it would have been  a different story.  Yeah, you know,  I should have made him  leave or something.  Then right behind  the soundboard  that was in the center  of the,  not the stage area  but the center of the,  I don't know,  what do you call it?  Little concert hall,  the VIP area  where the soundboard was.  Yeah, yeah.  A very dangerous thing happened.  I walked past 
[00:29:30]  a blonde-haired fella  that was screaming  Bubba's a cunt.  I believe you know him,  your brother.  Yeah, my brother  is completely out of his mind.  He needs to call the show today  because me and him  almost beat up a guy  at a diner yesterday.  That's a,  it's a great story.  I met your brother  and it was like  two worlds coming together.  Yeah.  It was beautiful.  That man is a fucking psychopath.  Absolutely.  I love him.  We called out Bubba.  We said,  you know,  Bubba said he'd fight me  anytime, anywhere.  So I said,  all right,  I'm going to be  at the Hard Rock Cafe 
[00:30:00]  and you guys joke over there  that we only have  four or five listeners  so it shouldn't be  too intimidating.  So if you want to beat me up,  that's where I'm going to be.  Obviously he didn't show up  so we're done with him.  We slapped him around a while  and we'll let him  wallow in his obscurity  and we'll go back,  you know,  fighting the real battle  with Howard Stern.  So,  but my brother called him out  and just fucking,  just brought the house down.  In case you didn't know it also,  Anthony,  Chester's Ashes,  I believe,  left Olunee's  with your uneaten portion 
[00:30:30]  of your meal.  Yeah.  That is up on eBay  right now.  Yeah,  what's going on with this?  I heard about this.  We headed over to Olunee's  after the gig.  A bunch of PalTalk people,  there were two PalTalk cameras  set up  and just packed out  with a lot of people.  We had a great time.  You talked to them in person?  Yeah,  it was amazing.  And I ordered  the chicken pot pie  over there  which was fantastic.  Such a flaky crust.  It was wonderful.  But I was,  ooh,  it's so big 
[00:31:00]  and my belly's so small  I wasn't able  to finish all of it.  So I left it there  on the table  and it was time to go.  So I got up and left.  Well,  much to my chagrin,  I wake up in the morning  and check the websites  for the pictures  and comments  on the appearance  and everything.  And there is a link  to eBay  and it is  the remnants  of my chicken pot pie.  Somebody had  taken snapshots of it  and are auctioning it off  on eBay.  And I looked 
[00:31:30]  to make sure  it was authentic  and yes,  it was indeed  the rest of my chicken pot pie.  It's up there on eBay.  The description says,  couldn't enjoy  St. Patrick's Day  with O&A?  Now some of that experience  can come to you.  This unfinished  feast of goodness  was consumed 75%  by XM Radio's  own Anthony Cumia  on March 17, 2006  at Oluni's  Times Square Pub  following a spectacular  broadcast from  the Hard Rock Cafe.  Upon successfully bidding,  you can have  this delicious morsel tea 
[00:32:00]  that you can either enjoy  as a meal  or display as a memento  for years to come.  Item has been thoroughly  inspected and found  to be completely  booger free.  And there's pictures  of your freaking meal.  There it is.  Perfect with fava beans  and a nice  Chianti.  Chianti.  Yes, exactly.  Wonderful.  And it's almost up to  1,000 views on eBay.  Of course.  Very popular item.  You know how happy  I was last night  when that stupid  Patrice called me.  I got the  I'm Patrice  and I'm bored  for a few minutes. 
[00:32:30]  Help me kill  some time call.  Oh, wonderful.  It's awful.  He never calls you  just because he wants  to hear it from you.  He's waiting for his  girlfriend to be  doing something  and in the eight minutes  he has to wait  in the truck.  To tide him over.  Exactly.  You're sucker number five  that he just picks up  and as soon as she comes out  I'll be like,  alright man.  Click.  Gotta go.  Get him good.  We chatted for a while  and he was enjoying  some of the old broadcasts  on Best Of.  And I just got him  like, so, you know  we're talking about his show  and I heard his show was good.  The Saturday show  he did was very good.  Oh yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, his Saturday show  is blowing up already.  It's great.  I got him fucking  so good last night though.  So I'm like,  what do you think  was the difference  between this week  and last week?  Um, I click.  You don't know the joy.  So if you're listening stupid  I didn't hear a word you said  and it made my night.  How long do you think  you rambled  before you realized  you weren't there anymore?  I have to be honest  probably not long  because he, I, I  as soon as he heard the click  he just smacked it down.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  And I hope Bob Kelly  shit his pants.  That's another fucking  lovely call I got last night.  Dude, I'm trying to find  a McDonald's 
[00:33:30]  because I'm gonna  shit my pants.  Bob is in the car  driving from Boston  and he said he couldn't  he was afraid  he wouldn't be able  to die in the car  because he had to  shit his pants so badly.  So I'm hoping  you didn't make it.  We'll have to call him later.  Hey, anything else, Doug?  No, guys.  It sounded great  over the radio too  if you didn't hear that too.  It sounded great in person  and over the radio.  I gotta tell you  I think that was one of our  better live broadcasts  since coming to XM.  Yeah.  And it's because we just  don't care anymore  in that atmosphere.  We tried to make  a polished radio show  out of that mess 
[00:34:00]  and we realized  it's impossible  when you got close  to a thousand people  just staring at you  and stuff  so now it's like a hang  and what's cool  about having your own channel  you know, you get to  take a peek in  what goes on  at these road shows  that we've been doing  for years.  Here's the comment I have  because there were  a couple of people  of course  Dude, the broadcast  sounded like shit  they didn't put any work  into it  this, that, or the other thing  you get people that bitch  and complain about the broadcast  here's the option  and we've heard from this  also  we've heard from these people  here's the option 
[00:34:30]  asshole  we take the day off  and broadcast live  from St. Paddy's  St. Paddy's Day  from the Hard Rock  having taken the day off  and just do it  for the people  at the venue  or  we bring microphones  and open it up  to a live audience  like we said  we were going to do  when we got here  to Satellite  we said, you know  Satellite gives us  the opportunity  to not only put on  these events  but to broadcast them  regardless of what  they come off like  some people love it  some people hate it  whatever  but the point is 
[00:35:00]  it's either  you hear it  or you don't  fucking hear it  and then we get  complaints from people  you know, they said  they were going to  broadcast these things  why don't they  oh, there you go  they said they were  going to broadcast  these things  why don't they  broadcast them  well, we broadcast  and then we catch shit  because it's not  a polished radio show  go fucking  first of all  Jimmy, if I may  sure, sweetie  that guy should take  his XM radio  flush it down the toilet  go out  buy a serious unit  and then  guess what I would  like him to do 
[00:35:30]  anyone?  anyone?  sign up?  no  kick their dog  kick their dog  in the liver  till it's dead  yes, that's it  I knew it  I was right for once  can I tell you  you know what though  really fast  I did read a lot  of feedback  on the broadcast  and I talked to the  people that I trust  and stuff  and rave reviews  oh yeah  more positive  than negative  absolutely  and you know  I was happy  to hear that  and then the  pal talk cameras  added to it as well 
[00:36:00]  there was like  how many people  were watching  on pal talk  thousands  it ended up  being on various  different rooms  over the course  of the show  I watched  our pal talk  for a little while  I watched Hulk Hogan  come out  it was great  yeah we were  more relaxed  because we realized  you know what  it's really tough  to make this sound  like a polished  radio show  so let's just  have fun  and whatever  makes the broadcast  makes the broadcast  that's it  but we learned  a few other things  that we'll  incorporate  into the next broadcast  yeah I think  we're going to  Boston soon right  that's what they  tell me  alright 
[00:36:30]  Doug thank you  you guys got your  videos up on  Foundry  you got loads  of pictures  up on  Whack Bag  lots of pictures  and a bunch  of the pal talk  videos are up  on FullBlownAids.com  so you guys got  plenty of media  out there today  thank you Angel  alright look  I gotta go inside  the show again  what Doug just did  there was  he wanted to get  a plug for his  website  this is gonna be  my new bit  I try to come up  with new bits  for myself  so my new bit  is going inside  the show  so Doug felt like  you know  there's a lot  of people out  there that hate him  and they're not  going to be happy 
[00:37:00]  if he just jumps  on with a FullBlownAids.com  plug  so he just  casually said  how there's videos  and pictures  on Foundry  all the established  websites that everyone  knows and loves  oh and by the way  there's a brand new  website that I'm  hoping blows up  and becomes huge  like the other  websites  yeah  you know  we drive around  we drive around  in Fords  Chevys  Dodges  and the  dugout  Dougmobiles  that's pretty much  what you just did  we're just one  big happy family  now  all problems 
[00:37:30]  are gone  love it  all worked out  more  more  more  good  Opie and Anthony  sites  more gooder  alright  that's right  thank you sir  all right  let's go to  Chuck in Ohio  and I like the  inside of the  bit by the way  it's very  I like  it's like a  James Lipton thing  because I was  getting bored  with the  angry typing guy  and quite frankly  you guys stole  that bit from me  it wasn't stolen  it's an homage  I'm different  I'm perturbed  typing guy  and Anthony's  upset typing fellow  you're angry typing guy 
[00:38:00]  I want to see  angry typing guy  go inside the show  that's right  my new bit is  going inside the show  I hope you enjoy  it  Doug just wanted  to get a plug  what Doug did was  see this is  this is why  you guys  no one else  heard that though  he doesn't give  a shit  you know what  I love Doug  but he doesn't  give a shit  about any other  website now  except his own  Doug's very  self-centered  are you kidding me  by the way  I need plastic  in front of me  you guys have  a better happy  typing guy  angry typing guy  because of the  you have the plastic  to type on  yes  you need something  that makes the sound 
[00:38:30]  I've been asking  for plastic  for a year and a half  now just a piece  of plastic  so I can do angry typing  I know  but you're not  responsible enough  to have anything  in front of you  that works  it's a little disc  it resonates  did you have to say  that people  I thought I was typing  it's a typewriter  let's go to Chuck  in Ohio  and it's fantastic  how you doing today  hey Chuck  good man  I think your screener  was kind of confused  why I wanted to talk to you  he acted like  he was pissed off  that I brought up  what I wanted to bring up  he's just pissed off  I loved the show  on Friday  I mean it was  fucking hilarious 
[00:39:00]  and the part  that really made me roll  was the fact  that you guys  had the guy  that's supposed to be  Bubba's best friend  on your show  it was fucking hilarious  not only do we have  yeah because I guess  Bubba's claiming  that Hulk Hogan's  a huge friend of his  is he  is he really Bubba  is he  obviously not  because you know what  I'll tell you this much  none of my friends  are going to ever  be on your show  no  ever  could you see  Patrice O'Neill  going on the show  none of our friends  will be on your show  so how much of a friend  is Hulk Hogan  if he's coming on our show 
[00:39:30]  and telling everyone  how we had a great time  and can't wait  to come back on the show  great crowd  that was there  truly shocked to hear him  I'm sorry for stepping on you  I apologize  that's okay my friend  you're a good caller  you're a good Ed Noonan  is that all  okay I'm punching out boys  that's all you wanted to say  I just wanted to say  that that truly was  my big shock  for the show on Friday  and for them guys  that said the show was shit  they're fucked in the head  that was hilarious  good show boys  yeah you gotta keep it  in perspective  I mean we pulled it off 
[00:40:00]  it was definitely a good show  you guys get shots  with Hulk Hogan  you had to be  oh yeah  I heard  I think I heard Billy say  when Hulk walked out  he goes  you're a legend dude  and somebody else said  something that really  well Bill Burr said  he was starstruck  to see Hulk Hogan  yeah man  I would have been too  and Bill said  something like  you know there's not  many people that  will make him starstruck  but he said man  Hulk Hogan was one of them  you know it's too  it's just that huge size  you know  the guy's giant  he's been a  walking out  a wrestling legend  for what 20 years  I mean he's a very famous guy  yeah he  nowhere in the country  he can go without being known 
[00:40:30]  yep  they were a lot of fun  they were a lot of fun  so  it was just a great great time  great time  had by all  yes  and then we're signing autographs  after the appearance  oh man  yeah I forgot about that  holy crap  did we ever find out  what happened  just a huge  just a  a huge fight  right behind us  brawl happened  now where we were signing  to our backs  was a big thick  glass window  and on the other side  is some kind of  little lobby  like downstairs area  from the hard rock  and an altercation 
[00:41:00]  took place  through that glass  so we had a view  like we were watching  on a big screen television  through the glass  of two guys  going at it  one guy  immediately decided  he wasn't  didn't want to be  involved in the fight  anymore  security came over  tried to separate  the two of them  one guy was being cool  separated  put his hands up  said okay  the other guy  did not want to go down  so now the beef is  the one guy  that didn't want to go down  and as much security  as possible  that was on this guy  and this guy 
[00:41:30]  was a trooper  he did not want to go  and they were beating  the piss out of him  they threw him  against that plate glass  and his head  just went  you heard like a  goong sound  when a head hits  like two inch thick glass  it just makes that  boom  and on the floor  they finally cuffed him  threw him in a coat room  where I guess  a bunch of hangers  fell off of the coat thing  and hit him  multiple times  yeah we really  I don't know what happened  that's the story I heard  like coat hangers 
[00:42:00]  fell off  and might have hit him  and uh  it was a bloody scene  to be honest with you  yeah he got taken away  by uh  that guy  it took forever  to get him down though  what a fight though  and that pretty much  ended the signing  yeah what a fighter  that guy was unbelievable  we were then whisked  out of there  was he a big fella  then I went down  to a loonies  uh yeah  yeah  big feller  oh an A fan  or just something else  uh he was probably a fan  uh you know  I don't know  what the fight was about  probably over a chick  nah probably fighting 
[00:42:30]  over one of my lines  one guy said  I said it this way  one guy said  I said it that way  that happens right  but you know what  we'd like that guy to call  yeah good luck  let's say hi to  remember he was there  yeah let's say hi to  Walt in uh  California  Walt  hey hey Jimmy  what's going on  hi  hey what's going on  fellas  I just wanted to tell you  that that that uh  party that sounded like  an awesome party  Friday  I mean I wish  I could have been there  man it just  you know it sounded like  a lot of fun  and your show is great 
[00:43:00]  you know I like the  interaction that you have  with the listeners  you know I've been  listening to you guys  since about  about June  somebody turned me on  to it and told me  their old SM radio  and uh I began  I began getting wise  to what happened  to you guys  with the sex for Sam  and what people did  and you know what  it started pissing me off  are you from Barstow  or Fresno  I'm from Fresno  okay  I just  I can tell this guy 
[00:43:30]  is either from Barstow  this guy isn't Laguna Beach  he isn't like San Francisco  California is a huge state  by the way  and I can totally  oh really  thanks for letting us know  Anthony  yeah by the way  Jesus  I'm just putting it  into some perspective  that  by the way  Rhode Island is not  a very small state  alright  but I could  absolutely tell  that this guy  was from one of their  more desert communities  thank you Walt  for the ass kissing  shit  you know  like those guys  what they did to you  I feel like 
[00:44:00]  they're fucking  with one of my pals  yeah right  I'm a truck driver  and I'm out here  and your show  got me through  the miles  alright  thank you Walt  I appreciate it  thank you Walt  yeah we had to sit  out two years  and three months  and it's starting  to feel like  the old days again  I gotta tell you  it's starting  to feel like  the old days  and we do things  like Friday  because we love  hanging out with the listeners  we always have  we're a very  interactive radio show  we'll always be  a very interactive  radio show  you know  we threw a party  we threw a party  Friday  for I don't know  over a thousand people 
[00:44:30]  I think the joint  could only fit  like six  a little over 600  we had to turn  a couple hundred  people away  to begin with  and then when people  were leaving  more people  were coming in  so probably  close to a thousand  people saw the show  on Friday  yeah  you know  that's what we did  for St. Paddy's Day  and you know  and I'm gonna point out  every single fucking time  Howard Stern  took the day off  because that's what  he does now  he doesn't give a shit  he doesn't have passion  for doing radio anymore  so while we're throwing  this huge party  for our fans  and showing appreciation  he's taking his Fridays off 
[00:45:00]  you know  and the deal he made  with the little doggy company  is to have every Friday off  and they're slowly  but surely  you know  starting that process  they're you know  having him take  every other Friday off  and then it's gonna be  you know  two out of three Fridays  and then by the summer  he'll have every Friday off  that's the deal he made  with the company  when he initially signed  but they didn't want  to throw that  in the face of  their subscribers  right away  so he does that  and we do that  and it's pretty obvious  who still wants to do  this radio thing 
[00:45:30]  and who doesn't  and who's  who's just  collecting money  at this point  so Godspeed to you  I gotta say  I'm watching the news  as we're talking  these funeral protesters  I hope somebody  picks up a rifle  and shoots  these motherfuckers  what's this about now  it'd be nice  this church of God  these really  really radical  anti-gay psychopaths  they protest  the soldiers' funerals  they hold up signs  God loves dead soldiers  thank God for dead soldiers  God hates fags  because they're saying  that it's a fag nation 
[00:46:00]  and the soldiers  are part of the fag nation  and I hope somebody  picks up a fucking rifle  and just kills them  fag nation huh  it's  how did the soldier  get tied into the fags  I don't know  I mean they got  a bunch of bikers  actually volunteered  and standing with flags  to try to block them  and I know the bikers  would probably love  to just bite  their fucking throats  but you can't  but I can't even  watch that  without really wanting  somebody to pick up  a rifle  and I mean literally  kill them  for their freedom of speech  even they said 
[00:46:30]  even the Nazis  the American Nazis  want nothing to do  with them  wow  even that far  right wing  a group of nuts  so there is some good  in the American Nazi party  you just  just to fucking  say something  so stupid  at the funeral  of the soul  it's just mind boggling  I swear to god  please god  I would never  encourage someone  to do it  but I would be so happy  if somebody just  killed a few of them  that's unbelievable  I didn't know  that was going on today  and they're all lawyers  too  the fucking 
[00:47:00]  this guy started  this relationship  somebody out there  must find a lot more  about it than I do  and a lot of them  are lawyers  because obviously  everyone in the country  wants to just  cut their throats  right  and that's a lawyer  and that's what  freedom of speech is  you have to let them do it  but I mean god  I hope someone kills them  let's say hi to Scott in Dallas  Scott what's up  hey guys  I was at the show  on Friday  my company's based  in central PA  so I drove over  man I had a blast  I could not believe  how much fun that was  and one thing I want to know  is what was Patrice  and Anthony's mom  talking about  after she got done singing 
[00:47:30]  it looked like she was  pleading with me  that she really wasn't  that much of a racist  well I had  I had to bring up  the point that  I learned a lot of  my racist lingo  from my mom  but that was way back  when  she's an older woman  now  so she was probably  explaining  that she's not like  that anymore  which you know  I forgot you were  so open about that  about a week or two  I had to say  that's what it was  you know  she used to say  things like  nigger rich  and stuff like that  if I would  let money burn  a hole in my pocket  things like that  and then 
[00:48:00]  hey mom  could you get me this  what do I look  three shades  darker than you  which is  it's actually called  a normal Italian household  can I tell you  something about your mom  it is ridiculous  how young she looks  my mom  she's an animal  she works out  she doesn't have an ounce  of fat on her  no  she's in her 60s  she's fantastic  dude she goes to the gym  and works out  I don't mean like  an old lady  walking workout  she's on the treadmill  like running  and then  she lifts weights  she's an animal 
[00:48:30]  it's unbelievable  how great she looks  ridiculous  it's really unbelievable  I heard the same thing  God bless her  it was like  you hear like  nigger and this and that  it was always  coming out of the bedroom  you ass  Gary in Indianapolis  Gary  hey good morning boys  Mookie  hey  just want to  let you know  that for five listeners  on Friday's show  you guys were making  a hell of a lot of noise  I know  yeah  we have a way to  multiply  the sound of the audience  so we ran it through 
[00:49:00]  a multiplier  it's called cloning  yeah  and cloning the voice  so it sounded like  a lot of people  but it was only five  we take the five listeners  and throw them in our  cloning machine  yeah  and we had the  pal talk people  do real tight shots  on five people  right  so it looked like a crowd  did you have a good time  Gary  oh man  the virus here in the Midwest  is spreading like fire  yeah we're getting there  fantastic  one of these days  we're going to take it on the road  I think Friday was a turning point  you know  because we haven't been out there  in a while  and to see it happening  it's like  alright cool 
[00:49:30]  we're almost where we were  and then we get like  forward observers  that go out like Jimmy  down into Atlanta  and we see like areas  pockets where  we know maybe we can go down there  do a broadcast  from venues down there  and get a good crowd  and maybe take it on the road  around the country  and Canada eventually  no I think we're going to do  Canada this summer  yeah  I was listening to Air Musique  or Air Mystique  that  I loved it  yeah  I enjoyed  really  the French music  I really want to  next stop 
[00:50:00]  is Boston  we'll have details soon  I believe  yes Gary  yeah you guys need to get out here  during the month of May  for the Indianapolis 500  that wouldn't be  that wouldn't be a bad idea  I hear they  they party at that event  that would not be a bad idea  where is it sir  a little bit  have a great day guys  you know we got to do  a road show too  we never did one in  even back in the old days  Sacramento  those people wanted us  to come out there  fucking back in 2002 
[00:50:30]  we were scheduled for  I think Cleveland or something  I don't know  before we got fired  I don't remember now anymore  yeah  well we'll have to start  hitting the road more  hey how about Buffalo  will they have us back  I don't know  how about Schenectady  no I think we  there's still a rumor  that if we go back to Buffalo  we're getting arrested  we're getting arrested  like there's an open warrant  or something  some kind of rumor  they just want us  to question us  about a few things  what should they Google  for the old  people of interest  what's the key Google  for the pictures 
[00:51:00]  of our Buffalo Roadshow  on the beach  because they're still there  oh and what was the event called  tits  beach  breast  beach  tits  tits and wings  wings  it was called something  just go to pal  TNA with ONA  thank you  TNA with ONA  but if you Google  Opie and Anthony  and write TNA  or something like that  or Buffalo  you're going to get a treat  yeah  you'll see what happened  on a beach  that hasn't happened  since caveman days  we turned Buffalo 
[00:51:30]  upside down man  we turned them  upside down  and I remember  going to the venue  and we were all  in like a limo  or something  and there was like  a massive  massive traffic jam  like where the fuck  are all these people  going thinking  we never think  anything of ourselves  and all of a sudden  like we're going to be late  right  and they were expecting  a couple hundred people  to show up  and there were thousands  all over the beach  and the traffic jam  was all the people  trying to find parking  and get to the venue  couldn't go to the bathroom  without  there was these two fucking  gargantuan brothers 
[00:52:00]  that worked  as security there  one's name was Tiny  that was funny  because he was big  yeah  remember we said that  like hey you're not tiny  why would they call you that  and that was the whole humor in it  why not call you Biggie  right  was he 7 feet right  he probably was about 7 feet tall  he was over 7  I think he was like 7'2 at least  they were fucking monsters  and his brother  was tiny compared to tiny  and he was like 6'10  and they would walk us to the bed  it was madness that day in Buffalo  and they did reports on that show  for I don't know 
[00:52:30]  a week after we left  a lot of people got in trouble  for that one  kids watching  strippers  fucked themselves with the zucchinis  on the beach  up to the ass  and most people don't remember  the Teenage with ONA show  because  shortly after that  a month  maybe a month and a half  we did the Sex with Sam  at St. Pat's  got thrown out  so  and the lawyers  for the company  we used to work for  were dealing with the TNA  with ONA  because that was  becoming a real problem  with lawyers  and lawsuits being  thrown around  they were finally able to go  look  they got fired  right  and then all of a sudden 
[00:53:00]  we did Sex with Sam  and I think that really  helped the company  go you know what  we got the TNA  now we got this  what the hell is going on  with these guys  so the next live event  is going to be a book reading  we're going to be handing out  books and crayons  and everyone can color  and laugh  no more chicks  we'll all keep our jobs  I'm waiting for my brother  to call  because we almost beat up  a guy at a diner yesterday  why?  oh that's fun  that wouldn't be a lawsuit  that's good  he needs to help me out  with the story  it was over  over a ketchup bottle  and  oh well  and I almost like 
[00:53:30]  emptied a ketchup bottle  over this guy's head  when my brother  held him down  but he's got to call in  because he was more  enraged than I was  Mark what's up?  in California?  yeah what's up Mark?  no  I love your show  I watched the video  of Twitchell  trying to keep his arms  and legs  and his head  from falling off  but I never got  to listen to the show  you guys never replayed it  when is that going to happen?  well  can I go inside the show again  Anthony?  yes please  I'm going to go inside  the show again  we did not have confidence 
[00:54:00]  in what was going to  make the air on Friday  so we decided to only  do three hours  instead of four hours  yep  and then we decided  to only replay it once  because we just figured  it was going to suck  and it turned out  it was an okay show  but it was only scheduled  to replay once  yeah exactly  so we either have to  replay it again  maybe when we're on vacation  or  I know you could get  the show from audible.com  if you want to go down  that road  oh fuck  I don't got an mp3 player  god damn 
[00:54:30]  what year is it  come on  alright Mark  everything  your toaster has an mp3  player in it now  doesn't like everything  have it built in  stop  fuck  no  no  you suck  alright Mark  that's the  I don't know  what to tell you  it's definitely  on audible.com  and if we're going to  replay it we'll throw  a promo on the channel  so you know what time  it'll replay  no we won't  alright  party on  alright sorry about that  party on  we gotta say hi  to my brother Elmo  Elmo  hey what's up  what's up man  I was telling 
[00:55:00]  you're talking about  a little catch up  incident I take it  catch up  yes  yes  we went out  to eat  it was just  a drunken weekend  at the old  Hughes estate  on the upper west side  us and the mice  and a bunch of us  went out to a diner  yesterday  to just get some food  that's all we wanted  you just want to eat  just want to eat  that's it  take over from there  Elmo  well let's just  start chanting  ketchup guy  is a cunt  and just get it 
[00:55:30]  over with  well we're sitting  at the diner  it's me and my brother  sitting across from  each other  and Lindsey's  to my right  and we're just  minding our own  business  and I'm telling  my brother  how I hate  the upper west side  because everyone  just stinks  they all think  their shit  don't stink  they all walk around  with their tiny  little dogs  that have little  coats on their dogs  in the middle of the winter  and little booties  because the salt  dries their little  paw pads out  and these people  will not move  out of your way  when you're walking  down the sidewalk 
[00:56:00]  where now I just  openly bump into people  like you know  what are you doing  wow you're the thug  of the upper west side  you're an old Jew  watch out  Ops are coming  these people  just feel like  they're the most  important person  in the world  and of course  you are  I don't go that way  you know I don't do that  the last person  bumped out of the way  was yelling  Zell  the white angel  he fucking  forearmed her  so I just  I was giving my brother  an update on the neighborhood  and we noticed 
[00:56:30]  that we have some  fine french fries  and we have no ketchup  now what do you do  what do we do  so there's a guy  sitting across from us  at the next booth  that's you know  because it's Manhattan  he's so close  you can pretty much  touch him  and there's a camaraderie  of diners  when you're eating  in an establishment  there's a certain camaraderie  you're all there  you're all eating  right  so you have something  in common to work with  and you know  I'll help this  this gentleman  along here  if it was one of these  five star restaurants  and you were having  some kind of  anniversary dinner 
[00:57:00]  there you go  then maybe  you shouldn't have  any interaction  with anybody else  in the restaurant  maybe  maybe  I still say  you should  but maybe  but that at least  maybe in that setting  but we're at a greasy diner  just trying to get some damn omelets  and french fries in us  right  right  so my brother's like  I'm gonna  I'm gonna ask that guy  for ketchup  I'm like good luck  I jokingly said good luck  good luck with that one  so pick it up from there  Elmo  well the guy is close enough  I mean I can literally  reach over and tickle him 
[00:57:30]  that's how like  packed this place is  so it's not  in any way  far away  or put them out  or anything  so I say  excuse me sir  and just that alone  this guy turns  and gives me  the most evil look  I've ever seen in my life  before we've even asked  because we were disturbing him  we were disturbing him  right  yeah  like absolutely  and the reason we asked him  because he's  he's really close  but also  he wasn't eating  so he wasn't using  his ketchup  or ketchup  however you want  yeah he was just  reading a newspaper  like he was done  with his meal 
[00:58:00]  that is key to the story  oh wow  so he wasn't even  taking someone's ketchup  that might need it  yeah  because if you need  your ketchup  you got to have  your ketchup  no one's going  to argue that  and then  this dude  hands me the ketchup  quickly and angrily  and then says  something to the effect  of  that's why  they have waiters  it's not my job  ugh  oh  but you understand  who he's saying that to  yeah  me and my brother  who just don't want  to hear anything ever  yeah  yeah  so we both turn  and just go 
[00:58:30]  excuse me  excuse me  and then the sparks  he's one of these  cock sucking cowards  who he'll try to be  you know  tough guy  because no one  on the planet  ever calls him  on it  that kind of thing  as we learned  later from a waiter  he had a problem  with  there's waiters  for that  excuse me  you're at a fucking diner  the guy is within  touching distance  he asks for the ketchup  and he gives you shit  like  oh yeah  like  like he's not your waiter  yeah he goes  that's what  waiters are for  it's not my job  job  oh is that really 
[00:59:00]  much of a job  to lift up the ketchup  bottle and pass it  over like a human  being you asshole  oh  fucking cunt  so we go  you're a fucking  asshole  we just get right  into it  good  you're a fucking  asshole  and then he goes  something like  you never know  who you're gonna  run into in this  world  and we're like  yeah exactly  what's your fucking  problem  and he's giving us  this look right  well he wasn't  typing at the time  that would have  been very ironic  he's giving us  this look  and me and my  brother are giving 
[00:59:30]  the look of death  that we're just  great at  I gotta be honest  with you  just the look  of death  we're looking  in his eyes  and we're going  back and forth  what other shit  was said  Elmo  well I kept  saying  yeah real  tough guy  won't pass  the fucking  ketchup  it's a family  place  you know  you got the  strollers  and the  upper west  side couples  just wanting  to have a  little  everyone is now  looking at us  and completely  uncomfortable  they're like  why are these  gentlemen cursing  at this other guy  you are making  what they call  the scene 
[01:00:00]  a scene  something can be  avoided at all  costs  well because the  guy thought he  could get away  with his comment  like you know  that's what  waiters are for  it's not my  job  and we would  have just  take it  because how  many people  no offense  to the people  out there  but you can  raise your hand  if you're by  yourself  how many people  would actually  take that  and go  you're just  an asshole  and then move  on with their  meal or whatever  not us  how old was he  oh yeah  give me a  description  how old  honestly what  Elmo  in his early  50s maybe  alright was he  alone  if that  yeah he's 
[01:00:30]  definitely older  and looks like  he looks like  he could be  a tough guy  was he alone  yeah he was  alone  so he's alone  he's sitting  there  he's probably  one of these  guys if you  guys didn't  say anything  would have sat  there and then  constantly like  looked at you  and commented  under his breath  oh yeah  fucking  like this guy  like I got it  like I'm  like I'm  this guy  like that's  his big day  and we just  kept continuing  saying you're  an asshole  and we were  just staring  him down  staring him  down  and Lindsay  said later  that both  our arms  me and my 
[01:01:00]  brothers were  just shaking  because we're  ready  we had the  adrenaline  we're like  one  probably made it handy  to get the ketchup  out of the bottle  too  shaky hand  I'll be honest  with you  I was waiting  for him to make  the first move  and then I was  going to shove  him into the booth  and sit on him  and take the ketchup  because punching him  would have been  too easy  yeah  too easy  I wanted to  humiliate the guy  because you know  if I'm going to  get arrested  he spilled my  ketchup  yeah  you wanted to  dump ketchup  on him  oh yeah  if I'm going to  get arrested  I'm not going to 
[01:01:30]  get arrested  for punching him  in the face  I'd rather the  story say that I  pinned some  asshole in a  fucking booth  in a diner  and poured ketchup  over his head  in front of  everybody  who you  Molly Ringwald  but how great  of a story  would that have  been  and we were  so close  I'm not going  to lie to you  we were so close  to some real  real action  going on  and I think  the guy  really realized  that he smelled  it and what  did he say  Elma  later on  you mean when  he apologized  so to speak  somebody gave him 
[01:02:00]  shit today  so he was  taking it out  it was the weirdest  apology ever  because he was  still pissed off  and like being  an asshole  but he's like  yeah I gotta  you know  someone was an  asshole to me  today so I  gotta apologize  to you guys  that's why I'm  being an asshole  to you  he goes  but I will  not sit  next to you  I'm taking  my food  elsewhere  oh you do  that  we reiterated  over fucking  ketchup  we wouldn't  let that part  go  because the guy  still staring  at us  like thinking  you know  tough guy 
[01:02:30]  you know  who I just  want to give  a little bit  of sympathy  to right here  his wife  or whoever  he went home  to imagine  that poor  because shit  just goes  down  you know  the bullshit  and if  if you guys  fuck with  them  and then  people  other people  fuck with  them  the only  person  he can  really  get over  on  is probably  his loved  ones at  home  oh  yeah  fucking  ketchup  you bitch  so he's  mumbling  on his  breath  and the  waiter  comes by  with his  sandwich  and he  goes  this proves 
[01:03:00]  that the  guy's just  an asshole  he goes  I wanted  it toasted  and just  hands it  doesn't even  look at the  waiter  goes like  this with  his food  and just  hands it  over  blindly  and the  waiter  just walks  away  shaking  his head  right  so then  the guy  leaves  and he's  mumbling  about how  he wants  to punch  me in the  back  of the  head  we found  out  because  there was  another  table  that was  with us  that was  near the  door  when he  was  leaving  whatever  and then  we all  got up  and all  of a sudden  the waiter  like  well that's  boring to the  story  but all  of a sudden  the waiter  says  your bill's  taken care of  so we're  thinking  an asshole  paid for it 
[01:03:30]  but it turned  out to be  another couple  that we gave  up our booth  for  and it's like  what is  going on  hey look  at that  a bittersweet  time at the  diner  but then the  whole diner  started talking  and no one  talks to each  other on the  Upper West  Side  but they all  turned around  like man  that guy  was an  asshole  I can't  believe  what was  going on  and everyone's  like  and then the  waiter's like  oh that guy's  an asshole  he wanted to  fight me  just because  I went up  to him  and asked  him what  he wanted  to eat  some people  are talking  about it  like sorry  for screaming  cunt in the  title while  you're eating  with your 
[01:04:00]  little kids  you know  kid hears it  all the time  but I can't  tell you how  close we were  to pin this  guy down  and just  empty  and catch  him on his  stupid head  what a dick  that would  have looked  great on  the lawsuit  yeah  well whatever  emotional damage  from ketchup  on  distress  with a heart  on Preston  his chest  dumping it  on him  oh shit  alright Elmo  Elmo's off  to go get  his  he sounds  like a  tough guy  and stuff  but he's  going to  stand in line  to try to  get Jimmy  Buffett tickets 
[01:04:30]  so good luck  to you  hey I don't  try to be  no tough  guy but I  won't  fuck him  back down  from a  ketchup  cunt  fucking  asshole  hey dude  did you  get what  I sent  you in  the mail  are you  talking to  me  yeah bro  would you  send him  now  I've been  in the city  for about a  week  oh a check  yeah  my brother  designed the  Jimmy Norton  monster rain  t-shirt  I've had these  weird things  electronic banking  I try to do it  all electronically  and once in a  while something  doesn't go  so let me

[01:12:00]  guardrail yeah that's the sopranos didn't he kill her yeah yeah it's the show stinks and david chase  everyone's like oh he's a genius just let him be he's a genius oh now he's showing you know what he's  doing by mixing uh er and the x-files that's what we're getting now right fuck the sopranos it's er  and the x-files put together uh no more crime is robert loger back on because he left like last 
[01:12:30]  year robert robert loger who knows maybe he'll show up in one of the dream sequences he went to jail i  loved him on this show he was great i was just waiting for big pussy to be part of last night's  episode why not why not throw them all in there oh man and just say it was a fucking dream please  because david chase is a fucking genius he's not a genius he needs someone to smack him in the face  and say wake up what are you doing put the show back on track he's like turning into pablo picasso  when pablo picasso uh had his had his uh had his uh period where he he threw the the uh ear on the 
[01:13:00]  forehead and everyone called him a genius genius no you're not a genius you're frustrating the fuck  at everybody one plus the only plus i'll give last night's episode no dr melfi thank god why was  she doing another project somewhere that's stiff jimmy perhaps i was busy you missed the episode so we  could like just help you out a little bit so uncle jr shoots uh tony soprano right and now uh got  so this week's episode starts off as as tony soprano being was he tony soprano in the beginning uh 
[01:13:30]  yes he was anthony soprano anthony soprano type of um salesman for something some type of uh top  salesman opie i believe it was a life that could have been is what that was that's what david chase  was going yeah he's in a coma after he's in a coma because of course uh he got shot  there you go and uh he's in a coma in the hospital and he's kind of having this a dream 
[01:14:00]  near-death experience thing that's going on and that's 90 of the episode yes so it's him walking  around as anthony soprano without his tony soprano accent right he's on the road he's on the road at  some kind of convention convention just a normal guy with a wife and kids at home he calls up his wife  i love you honey things like that he's not and they're different voices for the wife and the  daughter that he talks it's actually the same it's them without their jersey accents oh okay yeah and 
[01:14:30]  and if you noticed uh tony was doing the same thing he didn't have his accent on he did have his wheeze  though that he can't get rid of jesus christ what's with that nose holy shit all right cabella  hum wheezy he needs uh some uh breathe right strips i love my breathe right and this is why  david chase is not a genius unless the hpo hbo people influenced him or the actors sometime maybe  gandolfini got sick of certain things maybe he didn't want to do i'm guessing maybe he said i won't 
[01:15:00]  do it unless this is what should have happened unless i could lay in a bed like a beach ball with  pipes coming out of me jesus christ yeah i'm so happy they uh they showed me uh uh my dad's last  two days of his life oh because that's exactly what i lived that's exactly what i lived i'm like  this is great i'm watching hbo to get away from real life and you're reminding me of the two last  days i spent with my dad thank you that's why i hate hospital thank you david chase don't turn it 
[01:15:30]  into a goddamn hospital show there's enough hospital shows on tv give us the fucking you know gangster  shit that's why people watch the sopranos for the gangster shit we like watching guineas shoot each  other it's a proven formula that works movies television shows people love watching italian  guys killing each other can't you keep it that way did you have to get all artsy fucking fartsy  and make this life that could have been fucking coma sequence with uh uh 10 of the episode thrown in 
[01:16:00]  with them all at the hospital and stop what is this it's general hospital and stop making us think  that tony ashley might die he's not gonna die and that's why i i say shame on you  shame on you shame on you hbo shame on you david chase by the way jimmy norton will not be talking  for the next 10 or 15 minutes of this fine radio program and i don't blame little jimmy norton i would 
[01:16:30]  criticize uh the sopranos i just hadn't seen these i'm all caught up except for these let me explain what  happened okay jimmy so so uncle jr uh shoots tony soprano i'm all caught up except for these two  meaning i had just there's only been two episodes you little doll no he just when he just started  watching the sopranos i hadn't but when we were back on new i had seen none of them oh okay and in  the time i thought you meant this season which would have been silly no i caught up all five i just  have to now watch these two you caught up all five seasons all five except for these you know what 
[01:17:00]  would have been great because he's somebody that just caught up in all five seasons in a month's time  or whatever it was yeah i loved it i loved it i would have i wanted i wish i could have gave you  a little homework assignment what sweetie and and keep track of all the fucking storylines that just  go away and they never explain or bring back or nothing yeah because that's another thing i hate  about david chase and there's a russian guy running through the woods and his art david's a fucking  russian guy running through the woods best line in the sopranos ever was the mother when she said  oh why don't you go shit in your hat that's my favorite line ever all right why don't we get it 
[01:17:30]  for our can you write that down we'll get it for our replay she fucking rules yeah jimmy we'll give  you a replay with one miserable old bag old bat you'll have one clip so uh this is why i'm frustrated  with hbo and david chase they should have had tony die to begin this season because what they're doing  now is a whole storyline about they're making it look like he's going to die the doctor's like you know  you should lower your expectations and stuff yeah because they want us to think oh my god tony's 
[01:18:00]  going to die he's not dying because they don't have the balls to take out one of the main characters  you know with two seasons left of the show so now it's just like he's dying so now you're going to  see a power struggle for the family and stuff and and there's going to be two uh two two groups that  that kind of go off and then there's going to be some some high profile people getting shot i bet you  and killed which they would have done if they killed tony off but this is the way they could do it  without killing them yeah so they do all that and then finally guess what surprise he's going to 
[01:18:30]  make a full recovery just in time for the second half of the season or not even knowing these guys  like by the maybe the fourth episode i don't want to sit there and watch that show and have to  decipher symbolism i don't like doing that what does this other character who's licensed tony have  what does that represent in tony's life what is the briefcase and wallet uh why is he in this hotel  what is the what the the uh cityscape out the window with the rotating beacon on the horizon 
[01:19:00]  no that's not a rotating beacon man that's the sun coming up what it looks like a rotating beacon  it's sun it's a rotating beacon it's the sun coming up no it's an amber light beacon it's a sun that's  coming up that's representing the end of his life no why would it be a sunset then well that's because  it's a beacon it's an amber beacon i bet you it's a beacon i bet you i know what it is it's the sun  coming up what is it it's the jew spitting a penny it's a stupid sun coming up it's not perhaps the 
[01:19:30]  sun is coming up at the time but and that means he's running out of time when the sun comes up that  is it for his life what yes because when you die the sun's still gonna come up buddy  no one's gonna get my shit the sun's gonna just keep coming up every day and it's not bob edwards  it's it's the sopranos sony tony turns to ash collapses i wouldn't put it past that asshole  fucking david chase i hate this show turn it into buffy there were times i almost like this show but 
[01:20:00]  i just get so frustrated by this i was right with it i don't need symbolism like this i don't want to  decipher shit i want guinea a whacking guinea b over this job or that job fun fun television  a buddy of mine actually got a job in the sopranos a couple years ago he's uh he was the guy um  bobby he was he played remember the episode where uh meadow's boyfriend gets a job on the construction  site uh-huh and the guy that jumps up after they tease each other about being gay and the one guy 
[01:20:30]  kicks the dog shit out of the other guy on the construction guy yeah yeah the guy that did the  beating is a buddy of mine bobby he worked at caroline's for many years and i don't know if  he's still in there she played like part of a stripper's crew i think there have been 8 000 people  that have gone through the sopranos as cast members and uh there's only five regular ones  i know it's pretty much how it goes whenever tony dreams of a piece of cardboard that would  represent uh lorraine brocco's acting why do you think you do that i don't know deaf voice 
[01:21:00]  oh god let's say hi to george in jersey george what's up hey guys you know this show used to  mean i get laid once a week because my wife would watch just enough sex to sort of get the juices  flowing and now she had to watch her father you know relive her father in a hospital for the last  six months of his life i may not get laid for another month that's what i was thinking i was  like that's how my dad was the last couple days of his life thank you for reminding me mr chase  there's a select group of people that watch shows like that that watch depressing hospital shows a 
[01:21:30]  lot of people apparently because a lot of er did very well things like that gray's anatomy is another  one yeah but if you watch the sopranos you don't want to watch the hospital show don't turn it into  house on a very special house it's house's toughest case yet oh it is again wow oh there's a young  man convulsing on on the uh bed again what does he have i don't know he may die on an all new house 
[01:22:00]  right oh i can't watch the house commercials without getting the heebie-jeebies like i got something  all right well they remind you of other things you could die of oh i don't want to know i don't know  what happened he was a healthy boy and next thing you know he was convulsing on the floor  oh how's his toughest case yet and there's somebody going he's an athlete and and there  he is on the bed convulsing his house goes buy me i don't know another one they give me that i have 
[01:22:30]  no clue god damn hospital shows let's go to angry little fella angry little fella hey guys um i think  one of the redeeming qualities of last night's episode was having aj swear vengeance and i i i like  how he said he's gonna shoot him in his fucking mummy head who's he gonna oh mummy head his dumb  six flag dancing motherfucking mummy head you know what that means right he ain't what's that he ain't  shooting anybody no you think he's gonna be uh you know a soldier by the end of the season 
[01:23:00]  join the family i'll bet you that's the big i'll bet you let me guess that's the big end of the  first season is aj killing uncle jr nope i bet you junior is is so dead within the next couple  episodes oh really yeah because his part was useless the last you don't think aj will do it  though the last time sopranos was on five years ago whatever the fuck it was i think i was still in  college uh junior was uncle jr was useless no they're ready to get rid of him yeah junior's 
[01:23:30]  character they're ready to get rid of him fast it's too bad though because he's really funny  yeah he's great all right i think a good end of the season would be uh dr melfi goes for her  bachelor's and we don't know if she passes the test or not until the next one wow a whole episode  a two-parter a real cliffhanger i'm just waiting for my grades they raped me and i showed no emotion  yeah how about that one what happened with the melfi rape and the guy that did it remember  everybody was thinking tony's gonna find out and kill the guy or something oh no the beacon is 
[01:24:00]  something else uh eric in colorado eric hey boys hi two things for you first off yeah i agree with  you oh that was like watching the last six hours of my mother's life uh you know i know i'm not alone  out there that's why i have to bring it up today because it was an it was an uncomfortable thing that  unfortunately a lot of people have seen in a hospital it's like thank you this is exactly how  it was family members coming in and talking to the guy that's never going to talk again wonderful and 
[01:24:30]  then supposedly that's going to do something it doesn't do shit but hey that's that beacon in the  background when they were showing him in the hotel room yeah it was a fucking airport all right it's a  rotating beacon right on top of a control tower in an airport and the airport represents his uh being  able to leave which he can't it's right there in his view but it's out of reach  oh that's what did the ice bucket represent that's the light back hotel room that's the light 
[01:25:00]  back to reality and the airport that takes him home but he can't get home because right now  now i'm on to something well we're on to something because he's somebody else he lost his id and  everything and he can't fly out of there until he's looking out the window going i know i have to go  back to there but i don't know if i'm going to be able to because i don't have my ids and all that  stuff so i might be why christopher is driving a hundred thousand dollar maserati in the rain with  the windows down yeah he bought it on the cheap from uh what's his name in jail yeah but still he's 
[01:25:30]  in a fucking rain with the windows that's a nice fucking car by the way yeah i'm thinking of picking  one up he's probably getting wet and getting dripped on oh jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy oh my god  oh and then he hangs up i hope he didn't hang up i hope he was on a car phone and a truck fucking hit  him you fucking trampling douche he was chatty kathy over when opi was talking the whole time  me me me me me me me me me me me me me me let's be honest i didn't have anything there though so i 
[01:26:00]  don't care if you talked over me to save a dying man house must first save a dead woman we're going  to cure her you just recognized all new house all right new bit get all house promos get all house  promos which means just get one house promos wait oh he's gonna save a dying man before but  first he has to save a dead woman what what what is house doing is he a doctor named house oh he's a 
[01:26:30]  doctor named house and he's a drug addict or something and and he only gets cases that are  so fucked up that this hospital would be written up in a second excuse me look at your last 10 cases  they're the wackiest shit doesn't anyone come in with strep throat i know i want to make a show about  the homoerotic male nurse that smothers the elderly she's not gonna make it the guy who's got a body  like big kev and an awful beard like a tall 44 year old gentleman who just wants to kill old people 
[01:27:00]  on the next nurse all of a sudden you see two feet kicking and an askew white shoe that's what you want  to say they said she was getting better sorry these things just happen and that it was a natural death  and they show her dead with her mouth open her eyes wide open her hand splayed out and they help me  the nose twisted and pushed to the face the pillow with an imprint that it was natural i don't know  what happened on an all new nurse oh here we go let's go to mitch in jersey mitch uh hey guys how are 
[01:27:30]  you hi i got a listen i got a headache from watching last night trying to analyze yeah what's going on  it's heaven and hell first of all if you've ever been to orange county california that's purgatory  trust me and what's there my friend the oc well what do you do what do you mean it's purgatory what  does that represent i'm not sure what you meant it's tony's it's hell but you know his life has  been it why'd you say orange county represents purgatory if you've been there what do you mean  if you've ever spent any time in orange county there's nothing to do i mean you got la which is a 
[01:28:00]  great city and you got san francisco everything else out there so orange county is what  hey come on disney's there it's why what can i tell you but what you know what it's heaven and  hell i think because they're showing forest fires is the hell and the other side the the beacon the 
[01:28:30]  sun going up and everything oh interesting the forest fire that was happening yeah costa mesa  take time analyzing it i know i don't want to do that if i want to do that i'll really set my mind  to it and watch some kind of fucking movie or that that that is all symbolism but the sopranos is  supposed to be mindless mobster fun see i like the dream sequences that they had like when he was  driving with his father and this weird stuff if they're fast i don't mind it because they were  actually very well done it was like that is what a dream is like it's like kind of rational but yet  it's irrational dreck yeah that most dreamers shit i'm sitting there with people saying why 
[01:29:00]  why are they showing a repeat what's going on this isn't it where's the show start you know and i  gotta analyze forget it that's not good i just tipped over my club soda now i gotta open it but why did  that internally you don't understand how happy that just made me i watched my friend pick up a bottle of  club soda and he dropped it and inside it went yes it's everywhere anthony just pumped he was he 
[01:29:30]  wrapped his hand around it and he pumped it he opened the top and it sprayed all over him like  hot delicious cum all right listen we're getting killed we're getting killed on the instant feedback  oh no stupid dick face from new york we're getting killed here it's not his real name by the way  stop wanting the plot lines wrapped up the point of the russian episode was to show paulie falling  out of favor you dumb fucks want the same shit fed to you like other dumb americans duh yeah scott  brooks from uh virginia dumb americans dude it's not that you want stuff fed to you dude but in a show 
[01:30:00]  uh you do have to have a storyline wrapped up showing paulie fall out of favor is one thing  but they a lot of times they leave loose ends that's just lazy fuck well and don't try to turn a mob  show into some kind of fucking symbolism analyzing bullshit tell him to go fuck up what's his name  uh stupid dick face oh that's on instant feedback i could do away with him in a couple of clicks  we'll see how fast he gets wrapped up that's what we like yeah here here's your loose end 
[01:30:30]  on an all new house anthony what are you doing i'm going in and removing the tumor  no no stop just we're going in there dr coomia this word hold on and just this is very delicate  surgery i'm doing here just stop very just stop nurse why is it sweating i need a what there we go  he's losing his mind all right yeah yeah there he is oh there it goes and you go to the top 
[01:31:00]  uh-oh ban where's that tumor is it gone oh hey i think he's gonna pull through i think instant  feedback's gonna pull through all right listen that tumor's been removed all right he's gonna  pull through thank god scott from virginia you guys just don't get it man man everyone thinks  they know better than david chase sopranos has always been as much about psychology as it has been about 
[01:31:30]  the mob and family he's probably right yet you can't get too far away from from the part that  people really love what frustrates me is they develop some unbelievable characters on the sopranos  and then they do nothing with the characters they all kind of just sit around and every once in a while  they shoot somebody am i right and but that's i mean i that that simplifies it uh maybe a little too  much but the the character development on the show is unbelievable and you don't get character 
[01:32:00]  development like this on tv how great was annabella scioria whatever her name is as his psycho chick  yeah oh it was a fantastic episode uh let's see a big mess let's see fucking club soda come apart  like that no i ain't no kelly from gainesville florida did opi say paulo picasso if i did i know  it's pablo uh i bought some paulo picasso paintings oops opi it's a beacon don't make me hit you with  some ketchup oh uh let's see that's what separates the sopranos from every other hacky show on tv these 
[01:32:30]  days if you want a mafia show where someone gets whacked every week the sopranos isn't for you  that's also from uh scott every week uh by the way it's not a beacon i thought it was the sunrise  coming up anthony thinks it's a beacon well we got a third uh a third uh answer here richard in uh  north carolina richard yeah guys isn't the uh beacon the wildfire in the background that they  keep showing on tv no it's it's a regular bleep bleep it's a regular like every second beacon 
[01:33:00]  well maybe it's jimmy farting on the fire i don't know maybe the fires are getting a little stronger  but not strong enough to be completely over the horizon shot i don't i don't know maybe those fires  are coming his way and will he escape in time meaning he gets to live oh well maybe it represents  death and maybe the light is walking to the light means you're gonna die maybe he's fighting for his  life and i haven't even seen it i can figure this out i'm fighting for his life all right let's uh go 
[01:33:30]  to jason in north carolina or maybe he has to sell some more encyclopedias yes and that's where they  are i always go for the basic answer maybe it's just light because he wants to read  when tony's in the hotel on the seventh floor i think the seven because if you've seen an  elevator it said seven i'm thinking that's to do with the seven deadly sins and he fell on the  fifth floor whatever the fifth or or what david chase is very good at from the episodes i've seen  is making a dream sequence very realistic and a lot of times there are just non-sequiturs 
[01:34:00]  and idiocy in your dreams that really don't mean anything that's why a race ahead was good  yeah but see when he fell when he fell as he was as he was going down the stairs i think that's one  step closer to hell yeah yeah what i don't know what's with the alzheimer's thing that he told the  doctor told him he saw signs of alzheimer's because that him losing himself because the doctor in real  life is saying how he might have brain damage right yeah yeah so in the dream he's uh see i had a dream 
[01:34:30]  one time that i was laying down and a couple of large black gentlemen were using my face as a  chair and i realized that that meant that i was just very stiff and didn't move a lot like furniture  hello anthony's getting a phone call phone call speaking who is this  uh-huh my furniture yes  where's the furniture bitch all right it's gonna be when today what what time 
[01:35:00]  between seven and twelve hurry up fat slob he's gonna show you no fucking bitch i thought it was  gonna be like nine that's what he thought hey fat slob on the phone he's broadcasting special delivery  just for me for him stupid you are a fat slob you dumb bitch where's the couch someone turn the tv  down it's not a tv show it's not a tv show the furniture lady is a fat slob that you're talking to  the furniture lady takes it in the ass the furniture lady takes it in the ass we will expect the uh 
[01:35:30]  furniture between seven and noon and don't scrape it you and make sure every piece of hardware is  there make sure beyond are you familiar with the mishap of uh saturday  okay there was a mishap and that's why they're coming today and i will explain that mishap to my  listeners and if there is another mishap the name of the furniture company goes out over my radio 
[01:36:00]  shows airwaves that i'm on right now and buster you will not know pain until you feel the wrath of  the pests that's right that's why he thinks you're a cunt that's right hey hey and by that you are a  shithead no furniture bringing mother there's a room full we're in a gymnasium here and uh people  are talking smack with other teammates how fat are you whore yeah that's what'll happen pass the couch  i'll be looking for the furniture between seven and twelve and of course it can't be uh seven because 
[01:36:30]  it's already a quarter to nine you dumb shitbag so now it's it's gonna be a quarter to nine to twelve  right that's right somewhere in there okay thank you bye bye did you hear us get my shit all fucked up  you animals did she hear us she of course heard she was uh uh kind of chuckling at first and then  i don't know if the cunt helped out so what happened with your furniture sweetie can we tell 
[01:37:00]  it after the break sure can it really is a great story take a break and then of course i do want to  take nothing works jimmy you know right it's a great story i would ask opi if he knew but he has to  have furniture delivered before he can i got horror i once had something delivered you did  what what happened did they get scratched while you were watching the watergate hearings  let's go john new york john hello boys hey man uh yeah you know every episode you can mine a little 
[01:37:30]  something and uh my wife and i were you know sitting through all that crap and at least they had  you know the funeral scene with uh that loser gino and uh they had uh um the guys all trying to  jockey for position for tony's favor and you had you know paulie saying he was going to get it get  tony a little stereo for the room and christian now he doesn't need a stereo yeah you can see that  stuff starting there are there were some moments that were pretty cool in there i i don't know  we'll see where it goes it's not like i'm going to abandon the show and not watch it i'm in a t-vote can 
[01:38:00]  i can i watch the first two like uh no no can i watch the first one and then when do you watch the  second one and then we can all talk about it thursday all right thank you i'll have a dream i'll  figure the dream thing out immediately of course let's go to john in long island john  hey what's going on hey stupid what do you think about the telephone call at the end was that the  symbolism for tony waking up from his coma he went for the phone and he didn't answer it  yeah i guess when he finally answers the phone that means he's gonna be all right you're gonna be okay 
[01:38:30]  all right watch it out all right why don't we go to break enough with the sopranos i you know  it's just my opinion i was frustrated by the show and i a little bit i can't be bothered  but look how much we talked about it it did an hour of trying to interpret it it makes sense see  maybe maybe they're on to something who are we to say if i want to fuck are we to say if i wanted to  be all confused i would have just watched lost right that's what i would have done just watch a show  like that's a season and a half in that you have no clue about and turn it on that like do that what 
[01:39:00]  the fuck who is that guy what is he doing why is that's how it feels sometimes oh yeah what the  who the all right in an all new episode of nurse she shit her pants she paid with her life  we got to get house promos hey as we go to break yeah another highlight from our broadcast at  uh the hard rock cafe for saint patty's day on friday um you can download the show from audible.com 
[01:39:30]  i'm hearing and we got uh pictures and videos up on op and eddie.com but stalker patty stepped up to  the mic and sang her rendition of uh white rabbit i would listen to this if it i would listen to this  if it was on the radio yeah because it's an eerie version it's a very eerie version of white rabbit done  by stalker patty  it's one of the hardest parts of the song you don't play this one bill makes you larger and  one bill makes you small and the one sad mother he's cute don't do anything at all 
[01:40:00]  go ask alice when she's 10 feet tall and if you go chasing rabbits and you know you're going to fall  get up and tell you where she was going to fall and you've just had some fun

[01:43:00]  if you need an answer  from a company  from the phone company  cable vision  uh the oil company  anything  it's this  clusterfuck  you can't ever get to somebody  no one takes responsibility for anything anymore  there's always a chain of command  that goes in a big circle  and uh  i got a great example of that  over the weekend  i had bought  some bedroom furniture opie  i have a nice 
[01:43:30]  what they call a master suite  in my house  you know  yes  yes  you're just getting me more and more frustrated  why  not only do you have a brand new abode  yes  you now have new stuff arriving every day  but that's just it  i never owned anything  still in the same shithole  you gotta move  i'm trying  i'm looking  i don't like what i'm seeing  i looked for a year and a half  a year and a half  i looked for a place to live  call me crazy  but i want a little outdoor space in manhattan  call me crazy 
[01:44:00]  that's crazy  i don't want to be in a fish tank  you'll get it crazy  don't worry  you'll find a place  just keep looking  i'm looking  crazy  but for the money  you know  i'm spending  i just want to be able to  maybe open up a door  and just step out  and go  my air  that's a little rough  sit down and read the newspaper  maybe have a cup of joe  maybe kick your feet up  it depends on where  java if you will  you live  see there is  there is  there is 
[01:44:30]  central park west  right  and there's montauk point  now on montauk point  you can get  a palace  how about this  and then  how about this  central park west  you get a cracker box  and in between  is the scale  of uh  you know  the difference between the two  that's what sucks about  uh new york  people maybe around the rest of the country  just don't understand this  no  you could  you could get a nicer place  if you're willing to sacrifice 
[01:45:00]  your commute  right  so you have to balance it out  oh if you want to only commute 20 minutes  it's going to cost you  if you want to commute an hour each way  now you're talking about a nice spread  now you're talking a great spread  but now you're stuck on  like one of the worst highways  known to man  the long island expressway  you know it's not worth it  it's not worth the strain  it puts on you  the anger  an hour is driving  it's just not  I thought of going into jersey  but you know what I mean  I mean if I was Anthony  I would have got a 19 million dollar house  Jimmy I'm with you  that's what I would have done  Jimmy I'm with you  I would have got a house  on long island by now 
[01:45:30]  because I can't handle  that stupid commute anymore  so now I have a commute  that's less than five minutes  but I don't have outdoor space  I can maybe get two to three bedrooms  that's about it  that's why it took me  that's why it took me  a year and a half  to find a place  I was finding the perfect balance  of short commute  especially for the time of day  that we drive  and nice space  and I found the perfect balance  with this house  20 minutes maybe  and it takes me 20 minutes  to get in 
[01:46:00]  it takes me about 40 minutes  to get home  double the time  and that's still fast  because during rush hour  if I would leave  during rush hour  it could take upwards  of an hour and a half  to get home  hour and a half  but I don't go  during rush hour  dude coming into the Lincoln Tunnel  every night  and sometimes  I live six miles  and I knew the back roads  and I would  just still hit the tunnel  once you get to the tunnel  you can't do anything about it  this is your old place  the rage  the anger  the stress  I couldn't do it anymore  I used to be that guy 
[01:46:30]  you know who I am now  I don't give a shit guy  that's why  I am  I don't care  that's why I hate  Chuck Schumer  and Hillary Clinton  and all the politicians  because you'll see them  on New York TV  from time to time  oh we gotta get rid  of the violent video games  video games  video games  how about you fix  our fucking commute  that's what's causing  real stress  and headaches  in this world  impossible  but they'll go after  some stupid video games  like a video game  have you  have you tried to commute 
[01:47:00]  to Long Island lately  by the way  I did a sidewalk move  the other day  yeah  fantastic  that's why I hate  politicians in general  they don't  they don't take on  the real issues  because they're too complicated  they are too complicated  so they go after  the easy shit  oh a video game  a video game  rock and roll music  rock and roll music  very easy target  when there is a real problem  I'm sure it's happening  in your city  you could go  oh well this is our problem  in our city  well in this city 
[01:47:30]  the commuting  from Manhattan  to the suburbs  is so ridiculous  but no politician  wants to acknowledge  that this is going on  and then they try  to do things  with the roads  they make an extra lane  and it winds up taking  ten years longer  than they say it is  and billions of dollars  more than they say  it was going to take  because of corruption  and you know  whatever  whatever  let's see a politician  get into some real issues  that really affect us  instead of stupid  video games  no one is being affected  by video games  except maybe  three guys named Tom 
[01:48:00]  somewhere  that's it  but they were crazy  to begin with  and it just took  the video game  to realize  wow I can shoot people  great  you're going to always  get that shit  but the average person  loves their violent  video games  and nothing  nothing happens  because they're playing them  at least it's an easier  commute in Grand Theft Auto  isn't it  I could get across town  with nary a problem  sometimes my car explodes  you want to talk about  real violence  someone should do a study  and see how much  real violence is going on  because the commute  is so frustrating  that people are losing 
[01:48:30]  their minds  the road rage  constantly beating each other  and hitting each other  right  hitting into other cars  because you just  have to  after a while  you just have to  you're obligated  like the movie Crash  you just have to crash  into somebody  every once in a while  you get pissed  but anyway sorry  but that's the reason  why I have to stay  I have to stay  I want to live  on Long Island  I want to live  in the suburbs  I want to hear  the birds in the morning  but you can  you just got to move  closer  like I wouldn't move  out to Suffolk County  where you know  my family lives out there  but Nassau County  especially closer 
[01:49:00]  to Queens  than Suffolk  that's not bad  it's not a bad commute  I left from the city  to go to a lousy  Islander game  it took two and a half  hours to get to the game  it was after rush hour  yeah  it was after rush hour  what time about  it was like  what time to leave  it was like six  yeah that's still bad  that's still real bad  out east  I fucking hate  Long Island  the expressway  is the worst  I missed half the game  and I sat in my seat  like I wanted  to kill somebody  yeah  that's the real issue 
[01:49:30]  you stupid politicians  out there  go take on a real issue  if you live on Long Island  work on Long Island  you want to live  on that fucking appendage  sticking off the fucking city  well there are a lot  work out there  you're different  you're in the morning  you're Anthony  you don't count  a lot of companies  are moving some of their  facilities and stuff  out to Long Island  but other people  don't have a choice  they have to do the commute  fucking annoying  they don't have to drive  five miles an hour  everyone take the train  except me  exactly  that's what I'd like 
[01:50:00]  but you'll have these politicians  they're looking out for us  are you  are you really  all the big issues  you know what's going on  every day during rush hour  that is causing  people to get hit  and everything  because you know  there's a percentage  of people that just get home  and have to hit something  yeah  whether it's a wall  a wife  a kid  because they're just so  fucking frustrated  kick a dog  or they're punching  other commuters  it's happening every day  people losing their minds  when Jim went to see  Metallica Godsmack  it took us  I think we got there  at the end of  Godsmack  when I saw you guys 
[01:50:30]  at National Coliseum  fucking  almost three hours  to come from  somewhere in Manhattan  I wanted to just  firebond the entire road  yeah it gets you  so frustrated  oof  I almost cried one time  I did MTV sketches  many years ago  like these little free sketches  for the Jon Stewart show  or something  on MTV  and I had a gig  at this place  out in Long Island  who I won't mention  the name of it  because the guy  who owns it  is a fuck  and it was  I almost pulled over  and wept  it was like overtired  I hadn't slept  and I didn't know  Long Island could be that bad  and it probably took me  two and a half hours  to go 20 minutes 
[01:51:00]  20 miles  and you ever hit traffic  so bad  like you just  you can't believe  it's happening  you want to just cry  and there's nowhere  you can go  like there's no options  that's what  that's the most annoying part  when you're  even between exits  or anything  you're dead stop  and you go  I can't go anywhere  I can't move  very frustrating  you have to piss  I end up biting  not my bicep  not my shoulder  the soft skin  in between the two muscles  right here  as hard as I can  that's not good  don't do that  because you just  don't know what to do 
[01:51:30]  no new house  because you don't know  what to do  you have to hurt yourself  to calm down  bite the steering wheel  I've done that  I'm not even kidding  and I'll bite  my fingers  like this  sideways  just to calm down  yeah  can't be that guy  gotta just let it go  wherever I'm  wherever I'm going  they're gonna have to wait  a little tangent  I understand  but so  what I was saying  is you're getting me  very frustrated  and jealous  because you got the new house  and now new stuff  around  furniture coming  and I'm still in the same  shithole  because I just can't  accept the fact  that I'm gonna have to  spend all this money 
[01:52:00]  to live in something  halfway decent  in New York City  when I know  what I can get  on Long Island  that's the problem  I'm having  but anyway  go ahead  bedroom set  Saturday  supposed to be  coming up  I owned nothing  for my entire life  nothing  first house  I've ever owned  so I decided  no furniture  is coming with me  buying all new stuff  so the bedroom set  was supposed to come  Saturday  it was a big to do  to get them  to deliver on Saturday  they were all booked up  a whole big bullshit thing  but oh we'll get you in there 
[01:52:30]  we'll fit you in  it's gonna be anywhere  between 7 and noon  on Saturday  so now I'm like  mother fuck man  I was gonna stay in town  because as you know  Friday we had our  St. Pat's thing  and I was drinking  so I booked a room  I stayed in Thursday  so I could just go  zip right over there  and not have to worry  about traffic  coming in on  St. Patty's Day  and then I was gonna  stay Friday night  because I've been doing  some of that drinking  I didn't wanna drive  home  that good old drinking  yeah  but now I gotta go home 
[01:53:00]  after the gig  because Saturday  anywhere between  7 and noon  now if they told me  it was gonna be  9 till noon  I could've gotten up  and I'm not gonna  stay in  wake up at 5 in the morning  to get home  on an off chance  that they're gonna be there  like they said  at 7  so that almost  cost me too  because as I was leaving  I'm driving home  from the gig  and I actually  went to the gig  at the Hard Rock  we did the gig  and then went to  Oluni's  had a couple of 
[01:53:30]  beers there  here's some honesty  kids  so I was probably  technically  technically over the limit  but I'm one of the best  drunk drivers  ever out there  technically over the limit  who are you kidding  I wasn't hammered  but technically  if I blew into  the breathalyzer  it probably would've  had me as  impaired  or intoxicated  driving while  intoxicated  probably  but I was fine  you know  I could drink  definitely Anthony  yeah  so I get a call  from Super Agent  Bob Eatman  and he doesn't 
[01:54:00]  have my  OnStar phone number  he's got my  cell phone number  with the OnStar thing  you just hit the button  on the rear view  and you're talking  you're on the phone  your whole car  is a rolling phone  it's fantastic  so he calls me  on my cell  so I'm holding  my cell up to my ear  driving down 57th  by the way  the ultimate cell phone  yes  you could listen  to music  yep  and the cell phone  drives you  and the cell phone  drives you  it is the best  cell phone  I've ever owned  and you can get  blown in it  right  all these people  bragging about  their cell phones 
[01:54:30]  oh mine's an  mp3 player  mine's got a  dvd player  oh it takes  pictures  and it takes  video  really  Anthony's phone  drives him home  gets me through  the snow  Anthony can fit  three hookers  in his phone  it is the ultimate  phone  it really is  the ultimate phone  but he didn't  call me on that  so I got the  cell phone to my ear  it's a portable phone  it's a rolling phone  down 57th  and a lot of traffic  St. Paddy's Day  and stopped at a light  and here comes an  officer of the law  NYPD  New York's finest 
[01:55:00]  knocks on my window  I'm on the phone  I roll it down  I go yes officer  he goes  doing random  dewee checks  for people without  seatbelts on  and cell phones  license  registration  where you been  where were you  right outside the tunnel  or  no I was at 57th  and probably  5th  I hadn't gone far  at all  yeah I was heading  toward the bridge  god what  that blows  that's what they  were doing  any excuse  to get a driver  to give them  a reason to stop you  so I was on the 
[01:55:30]  cell phone  and I tell Bob  I go  Bob gotta go  I might be  getting a dewee  so I leave Bob  with that  and  you should let him  listen in  no  the cops don't  find that  remember the clip  we had of the  woman on the  cell phone  with the officer  I figured I'd  get off real quick  before he tased me  so he goes  where you been  and without  slurring a word  I said  we were doing  a live broadcast  from the  Hard Rock Cafe  my radio show  Opie and Anthony  show  I'm Anthony 
[01:56:00]  I handed my license  I wasn't even  gonna try  not to throw  that card out  immediately  so I handed  my license  he goes  oh Anthony  I go yeah  he goes  ah my partner  is a huge fan  he goes  if I pull you  out of this vehicle  he's gonna  fuck me up  for sure  take it easy  man  safe home  see kids  that's what  privilege is like  that's what  privilege is  I love it  we are  huge supporters  of the NYPD  always have been 
[01:56:30]  always have been  and that isn't  like you know  that was before  they cut us  anything  and believe me  I've been  I've gotten pulled  over by many  a prick NYPD  and been written up  and they didn't  want to hear  who the fuck  I am  so it's  it goes along  those lines  he really thinks  who the fuck  he is  doesn't he  fucking guy  anyway  so  skated that one  and yeah  it would have been  nice for me  to be able  to stay in the hotel  but I had  the furniture  we almost both  got arrested  this weekend  yeah  that would have  been nice  huh  the uh  what did they 
[01:57:00]  call us  toxic twins  jailed  you know  what would have  been funny  if he said  my part  after he gave  the license  back  if you would  have snatched  it and rolled  you up  and said  no autographs  I don't know  why I just  did the hand  motion  like you would  have anything  other than  a fucking  radio's  Opie and  Anthony  jailed over  the weekend  we'll tell you  why  like make it  sound like  we did  something  my story  would have  been cooler  you think  yeah  mine's just  the stupid  pinning a guy  down and  emptying his  ketchup on  his head  oh that  would have  definitely  been cooler 
[01:57:30]  definitely  would have  been cooler  Anthony  with his  pants around  his ankles  like fucking  Justin Volpe  raping him  with a baton  because we're  tough guys  yeah  no Bob  I'm getting  a D-Wing  yeah the  cop won't  leave me  alone  I don't  know  shit  oh  what  well look  at this  let's go  to Chris  in Pennsylvania  Chris  hey  Anthony  yeah  yeah  I can't  believe you  fell for the 
[01:58:00]  we'll squeeze  you in on  Saturday's story  it's being  a customer  service manager  that was just  to get you  off the  fucking  phone  man  yeah  yeah  pretty much  we don't  give a shit  well this guy  is saying  you used to  do customer  service  the matter  you get  the less  we care  well listen  to what  my pal  Anthony  did  here's what  I do  now  these days  here's what  I do  now  this takes  balls by the  way  so they  fit it in  and this  is now  we've been  looking for  a bedroom  set for  a while  this is  a new  house  I'm very  proud of  it  I like  it  it's the 
[01:58:30]  first place  I really  have given  a shit  about  as far  as buying  furniture  that's why  I didn't  come here  with any  furniture  I have to  get everything  new  so it's  not just  on a whim  that I'll  go out  and buy  something  so this  bedroom  set  is the  bedroom  set  we wanted  so they  finally do  get there  and it's  see this is  all furniture  related people  so let me  please be a  problem  speaking 
[01:59:00]  hi  good how  are you  a little  apology  with the  delivery  yeah that  was a  we call it  a cluster  F  if you  might mind  my language  but  you know  what that  is  that kind  of  it's the  store manager  apologizing  too late  bitch  how about 
[01:59:30]  fucking  not doing  that again  stupid  ass  turn the  tv down  furniture  women  suck  hey store  manager  lady  Anthony  was just  calling you  a cunt  i just  hung up  on her  i had to  hang up  you're gonna  fuck up  my delivery  this fucking  hole  she's calling  to apologize  is she  is she  give me the  phone next  time she  calls  we'll take  care of her  oh my god  you're gonna  fuck this  up  i'm sorry  you certainly  are  bitch  you better  be  click  oh my god  holy shit

[02:00:30]  useless  you fat  slob  oh my god  you fucking  guys  who is that  are the worst  she didn't hear us  she's the head  of the friggin  store  is she  oh  oh i'm sorry  we didn't know  and she called to apologize  for the clusterfuck  that happened  uh saturday  we'll call to apologize  to her after the show  yeah give it  let me uh  let me call  no you are not  let them say sorry  yeah we just want to say sorry  going in my pocket  you can do whatever you want  after it's delivered  if they call after the delivery  i'll be right with ya  anyway 
[02:01:00]  eleven forty five  they decide  so they're obviously  calling back  because this was a big  this was a big problem  yes  and and how i handled it  is why i'm getting these calls  and why  this company does not deliver on mondays  they don't deliver on sunday and monday  they are delivering  today  to my house  because this is what happened  when they showed up  uh  they show up  uh  they unload all the furniture  bring it into the house  upstairs  into the bedroom  nice  uh  a lot of stuff  yeah 
[02:01:30]  yeah  there's a  bed  there's a  a  like a  four poster bed  okay  uh  two big end tables  okay  a big dresser  all right  with a mirror  pretty much a whole bedroom  bedroom set  yeah  for a king size bed  huge king size bed  so they have to disassemble  the bed that we have  and put it up against  you know  the wall  making sure  not to scratch  my wood floors  or my walls  i hope not  because every scratch  is a demerit  and a demerit  is less of a tip  do you tell them that  yes  no i don't 
[02:02:00]  i tell them  do not scratch my floors though  i make a point  before they even step in  my wood floors  don't get scratched  and he says that  as he's walking around  his place with a gun  yes i make sure  all my guns are displayed  uh  no  riffraff  let them know  that they're not  casing the joint  so they uh  they bring everything in  bring everything off the truck  in the house  disassemble the bed  put it to the side  bring in uh  the the bed  to set up  then the uh  mexican delivery guy  one of two  goes  uh  there is no 
[02:02:30]  uh  the wrong hardware  for the the bed  wrong hardware  i go okay  i'm smiling  i go okay  what does that mean  what does that mean  um  well  you have to call  service  department  i go oh i do  um  and when will they be  showing up today  to assemble the bed  oh they do not  work on saturday  you call them on  on tuesday  and  and now i go  i go okay  watch this jimmy  i go okay 
[02:03:00]  watch this  i go  see all the furniture  you just brought in  get it the fuck  out of my house  and this is the exact  words and language  i use  i go  load it back  on your fucking  truck  and leave  no sale  done  i'm not paying  for this shit  this is over  get it the fuck  out  right now  and then i call  up the furniture  store  have the same  conversation with  whoever at the  store  but they're all  this is what i said  responsibility  no one's responsible 
[02:03:30]  it's not the driver's  fault  he just delivers  uh  why isn't the  hardware on there  well it was probably  the dispatcher guy  that's supposed to  make sure parts  are in there  but he gets  paperwork from  some guy  that it's on a  sheet  that's printed  out  and that guy  there's some  numbers that are  probably similar to  other part numbers  so it's never  there's never the  guy with the  fucking packet of  hardware that went  ah this was supposed  to be on the truck  and i fucked up  and why couldn't  they bring it to you  i said where's the  warehouse  they go jersey  i go okay 
[02:04:00]  that's not fucking  cleveland  get some guy in a  car  drive it out here  it's fucking you  know not even uh  noon yet  they could have been  out there by  one  assemble the fucking  bed  no  they don't do it  why would they say  can't do it  i didn't get an answer  no one has a fucking  answer  so that's why i  said i go and  and and i i knew  this was a strategy  this was a cut off  your nose to spite  your face chance  like thing because  it was the bedroom  set i wanted  and it took a while  to find and i knew 
[02:04:30]  looking around is a  bitch for everything  so i'm like i'm  gonna have to now  look for another  fucking bedroom  set but this is  the way i have to  handle these  motherfuckers now  no sale and  believe me we're  talking thousands  of dollars in  furniture goodbye  get it back on your  fucking truck and  leave and they  loaded it back on  and i'm watching  them load it i'm  standing now here  picture this scene  did you tip the  guys not a penny  but i don't give a  fuck but no but  sorry but guilt by  association they have 
[02:05:00]  to learn maybe next  time he'll fucking  make sure that the  hardware's on the  truck i tip very well  i over fucking tip i  know you do that's  why i'm i'm asking  not a dime not only  that because i'd feel  guilty oh man they  brought it all upstairs  and now i had to  take it back out i  gotta give him  something they load  everything back on  the truck yeah that  one guy gets in the  passenger seat the  other guy's heading  over to the driver's  seat picture this my  huge double doors are  open to the front door  they tower over me 
[02:05:30]  your 30 foot doors i'm  leaning yeah my 30  foot high doors i'm  leaning against one as  the guy's just ready to  get into the truck and  i know he's just ready to  get in leave just ready  almost close the door  i go hey yeah you're  gonna set my fucking  bed back up oh no  shit get back in my  house they go upstairs  good and reset up the  bed the way you fucking  left it good and they  did they had to and he  leaves the guy was 
[02:06:00]  huffing huffing when he  left he goes have a good  day you too they if he  could have peeled out in a  big furniture truck he  would have they were  pissed livid so now a  half hour later bring i  get a phone call it's uh  the uh head of deliveries  he's the head guy for  deliveries tells me uh  there was a problem i go  oh yeah big big problem  they didn't have the  hardware uh sale is off by 
[02:06:30]  the way i don't want it  i'm i'm uh getting a  refund or i'm calling up  amx who automatically you  know pulls payment back  they're great with that  really oh if you get it  loved fucked over by a  company call american  express tell them don't  pay it they launch a full  investigation they don't  pay it's a big pain in  the ass and they do all  your dirty work it's like  having leg breakers work  for you american express i  love them so uh the guy's  talking to me going look  what can we do to remedy  this problem uh anything we  can do i said i want i want 
[02:07:00]  new furniture not the stuff  that was brought up and down  uh in and out of my house and  i want to make sure the  hardware there and it's set  up on monday and you know a  little discount and that's  it and they said okay to all  absolutely all your demands  the guy gave me his personal  cell phone number if anything  goes wrong and his name is  ramon which made me laugh  because if there's a problem  you're calling jimmy  ramon get this grease monkey 
[02:07:30]  out of my house bring me a  mexican with a wrench  that's great and now here's  here's the thing the guy's  like what can we do to remedy  this problem how far into that  did he find out you were on the  radio and that didn't still  don't know they still don't  know they still don't know i  didn't want to play that card  here it's not even about the  radio here you're canceling a  sale worth thousands of  dollars that they take  notice when when he said 
[02:08:00]  what could i do to make this  right which he means what can  i do to make you not cancel  the sale you know what you can  do do what you should have  done in the fucking first place  not have four five hour windows  of delivery not uh have have  people loading trucks that are  fucking uh that don't make sure  shit is is uh on the truck and  people that just don't care or  don't take responsibility for  anything how about if you would  have done this the way you're 
[02:08:30]  treating me right now do that  right from the start yep how  about that and not because i'm in  radio because they don't know  but just because i'm a fucking  angered customer that doesn't  want to spend thousands of  dollars and get shit on and this  isn't just this place mind you  uh this is every place i've had  to deal with in the past 10 15  years with anything when i have  gone downhill when i have my sofa  delivered they had the wrong  hardware to attach the sofa like  the three pieces always and the 
[02:09:00]  problem is they don't go look we'll  get it out to you like they  couldn't do it that day because  they had to get a special guy to  come out and do it you gotta wait a  week to fight they don't give up  it's their schedule then then you're  on their fucking schedule because  they fucked up now what was i  supposed to do if i would have sat  there and said all right i'll wait  for the service guy and i'll call  him tuesday so i'll sit here in a  room full of junk furniture that's  junk my bed's taken apart now and  what i'll sleep on the floor i'll  sleep no i've gotten to the point  now where this is what you have to 
[02:09:30]  do people i implore you you ever  have a problem curse at them tell  them to get the fuck out of your  house with the shit take it away and  you will get a courteous call moments  later begging you how they can  fucking help and that's the only way  to handle these motherfuckers these  days because the warehouse is gonna  get a lot of shit yeah if they fuck  up and cost the company thousands of  you know what happened they then had  to load load all my shit back on the  truck now all the shit behind it they 
[02:10:00]  have to deliver that so now every time  that shit's got to come i completely i  fucked up everyone else's day good i'm  the guy that fucked up everyone else's  delivery because they fucked me and now  you understand the phone calls that  were coming in during the show that's  yep that's how it works and and the  only way to deal with it is to pull the  money out from under them right pull  it right out from under them and they  will call you and beg you how they can  fucking help beg you i had a problem  with a lamp recently that got delivered  um and the guy that's the delivery guys 
[02:10:30]  were nice they spent a long time trying  to get like there's like a long um  fluorescent in the back and there was  something wrong it wouldn't kick on and  uh the guys were great but i called the  warehouse and the fucking warehouse well  we'll have a guy out uh sometime next i'm  like why can't you do this with a new  bulb tomorrow do it tomorrow what's the  problem i finally was like just uh i  said something nasty and i like and  then he goes all right we'll have it  wednesday and they gave it to me  wednesday and it turns out there was  nothing wrong with the light there's  just plastic on the bottom just pulled 
[02:11:00]  the plastic off and the light worked  there was there was uh the mexican was  on the uh two-way motorola with the  warehouse and there was some dyke woman  uh working uh dispatch i guess over  there and he goes he wants me to uh  take everything back and she goes  really uh uh there's no way that um uh  you can leave it there until uh service  guy gets there and he right when he  keyed down i went nope there's no  fucking way and she goes okie doke like  all right like ain't her problem and 
[02:11:30]  then apparently later on it became her  problem good because ramon called me  good old i just wanted to know why this  man's furniture wasn't delivered  properly all right they are just a  bunch of pricks and the only way to  deal with them is to yell and take  their fucking money away and that's the  only way they would do it don't back  down don't say okay i'll call the  service guy because they all act like  they don't give a shit they don't and  they're not responsible but believe me 
[02:12:00]  down the line the shit will hit the  fan when he comes back to the  warehouse with the furniture and the  guy that loaded it is now has to  unload it he goes what's this doing  isn't it supposed to be delivered oh  didn't have the hardware uh wait a  let me go to this guy and then they  keep going up a notch one supervisor at  a time the hardware wasn't on who's  supposed to do that i don't call this  guy get the and then before you know  it it goes up to the top somewhere  where someone could rack some head and  someone gets in trouble but it's never  one guy you're right it's never like  ah that's frank's department and yeah  all in frank goes i fucked i fucked up

[02:20:00]  Gotta love that.  The latest from God Smack.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  What's in the news today, by the way?  That tragic story about the Chinese swimmer.  Yeah.  What was that, on the New York Thruway?  Yeah.  New York State Thruway.  On the Thruway, a woman that was driving the van with these swimmers in it  has some problem with her tire and pulls over in the right lane.  There's a shoulder, but she stops in the right lane and just gets plowed over by a truck. 
[02:20:30]  You ever have that happen to you, by the way?  I was driving home from Boston once.  Came around one of the turns.  What was it?  The Merrick Parkway, whatever it's called.  And it's a windy road.  And we came around a turn.  Next thing you know, there was a car stopped in the left lane.  Yep.  Like, are you fucking kidding?  People are stupid.  I mean, you might understand in traffic why somebody can be stuck in the left lane or the  middle lane or the right lane because all of a sudden your car died.  Right.  If you're on a highway, you're obviously moving. 
[02:21:00]  You're doing highway speed when your car breaks down.  There's no way that kinetic energy cannot get you off the road.  You're rolling.  Move over.  Some people just panic and freak out and roll to a stop in a straight line.  Other people get into fender benders.  And here's the biggest misconception ever, ever, ever.  That if you're in a fender bender, you have to leave everything as it was, like it's some  fucking murder crime scene.  Get off the road.  Yep.  If you bump into somebody, you scratch fenders, you rear end somebody and buckle their trunk. 
[02:21:30]  If both cars are still running and movable, get the fuck off the highway, not only for  your own safety, so we can move, so we can go and not be stuck in traffic.  But they think that the cops have to come with tape measures and circles with numbered  signs like it's a friggin' murder scene.  Get off the road.  They're waiting for CSI to show up. 
[02:22:00]  They think they're going to be arrested.  Yeah, CSI is going to show up.  They're waiting for CSI to show up.  Pull a pubic hair out with tweezers.  Because you're a stupid fender bender.  No one cares.  The cops don't even care.  A lot of people are under the impression that it's a crime to move the vehicles after  you're in an accident.  Leaving the scene of an accident.  You went from here to there.  To that shoulder.  It's not.  Move.  And while I'm at it, left lane, get out of the way.  Just like to add that in whenever is humanly possible.  Left lane, look in your mirrors every so often. 
[02:22:30]  Could you look in your mirror right now?  You're in the left lane listening.  Look in your mirror.  Is there someone behind you and no one in front of you?  You're the guy.  Get out of the way.  Yeah, they pulled over to the right lane instead of the shoulder.  Maybe it was a mistake.  Maybe she just thought she was just dumb.  But the tractor trailer just completely destroyed him.  Like the worst possible scenario.  For the trucker, too.  You know, awful.  He feels better the rest of his life.  He's going to see all shit.  We have a big trucker audience. 
[02:23:00]  We've heard them.  They don't care.  They don't care.  They're probably right.  They're like the furniture delivery warehouse people.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, great.  Now I'm going to be late.  Yeah.  Now I'm going to get in trouble.  How am I supposed to get this load up there?  I'm going to be late, and I don't have enough crystal meth to pass the time.  Yes.  And it was also in the news.  Wait, wait.  Just to finish up on this, though.  So, yeah.  So, they had a flat tire.  They stopped in the right lane instead of the shoulder.  Right.  Got out of the car, and the rest is history.  And I'll take a look.  Front page of the Daily News.  Dad still calls her cell phone just to hear her voice. 
[02:23:30]  Why would you do that to yourself?  Why torture yourself?  Why would you do that?  Torture.  It's torture.  It is, but I don't know.  That is just pure torture.  If that's the only thing you have from that person.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's, uh.  Well, I guess people do some strange things.  It's not like a parent.  When you lose a loved one.  I understand that.  But that's something I can't comprehend.  I wouldn't do that.  I wouldn't want to hear the voice.  No way.  But again, if I could.  It's like 9-11 survivors.  Their families left the messages.  They saved that.  They saved that, man.  You never.  And that wasn't a bad time.  Right. 
[02:24:00]  You don't ever delete that.  But those were messages coming in.  Their last.  They were calling home and getting answer machines going, oh my god, I'm going to die and I'm  on an answer machine.  Well, I'm going to leave something anyway.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  That's awful.  I know I'd fuck up and say something stupid or I'd think I was.  Your last word.  Just lame.  Yeah, listen, I just wanted to tell you, but hey, who spilled that click?  Click.  Me.  Awful.  And then the boy.  Give me those ribs, you.  Then the boyfriend of one of the Chinese swimmers that died. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Goes to the meet anyway and wins.  Wins the gold.  Wins the gold, whatever.  You think they might have let him.  Ah, look, I'm not saying the power of his grief and everything couldn't have been, you  know, something driving him.  That propelled him?  You think the other swimmers might have, you know.  Said, you know what?  I think I win.  And then he stands there and watches the meet that his girlfriend would have been in.  With everybody around him.  Yikes.  Holding him and stuff.  Yee.  That's too much.  Why would you?  People are so into sorrow. 
[02:25:00]  Look, I ain't into it.  I don't like grief.  It's hard, though, in the moment.  It's like, I can see if it's the fifth anniversary and he's still showing up at the thing looking  at the empty pool.  He's kind of a...  I'm serious.  But, you know, like, if it just happens this week or whatever, it's sudden.  It's not like a grandparent who's got fucking leukemia.  This is like a young girl who's just gone.  You talk to her an hour later, she's nothing.  She's dead.  So it's like, how do you handle that?  You gotta just sit there and look.  Anyway, so that's a big story. 
[02:25:30]  And she was a cute little Asian girl.  She stinks.  What?  The whole story just stinks.  Oh, you said she stinks.  No, no, no.  It's a story.  I wouldn't fucking make fun of that.  So, what do you have in the paper over there, Jimmy?  Besides the fact that one of the interns has his hat on backward on a fat head.  Jesus Christ.  At least get a hat that fits.  Who was it?  I don't know.  He bought a medium.  Oh, Bobby. 
[02:26:00]  We don't need Bobby in here.  We acknowledge that you're looking for attention.  Thank you.  Bye.  Jesus.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  The interns do this to us all the time.  All of a sudden, they show up in a dress.  We get it.  You want air time.  Exactly.  Come on in.  Either you're mini pearl or you like that hat.  What can we do for you, son?  Just taking people inside the show.  You know, it's my new bit.  I like it.  I see the interns.  Like, they go unnoticed for months and all of a sudden they show up in some ridiculous 
[02:26:30]  thing because they're like, hello, I'm here.  Something silly.  Right.  I haven't gotten enough air time.  I want air time.  Bobby does a good job for us, though.  He certainly does.  Turn the hat around, stupid.  All right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I just noticed that there was a slave lesson.  His home for Long Island students was a guy, a white professor.  And I understand he's trying to teach that slavery did occur here in New York.  And it's fine to bring the facts to light.  But there's a picture of him.  Alan Singer.  His name is Alan Singer.  Oh, what page?  It's on page, I don't know. 
[02:27:00]  It's on page, I don't know.  Page, I don't know.  It's on the metro section, page two.  Page 46, actually.  That would be in the daily news.  So you go through two pages of news, 44 pages of ads, and then you'll find it on page 46.  Oh, my God.  How did I miss this one?  I don't know.  It's a white guy with his hat sideways.  I can't find it.  I have Ann Landers on page.  Well, maybe you're looking in the wrong paper, you doll.  No, it's the New York Daily News. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, well, how'd you like a good hug?  Love one.  I would suggest that fans, instead of standing around thinking about a commercial agent whose throat he wants to cut.  You might want to help out Anthony.  There he is.  All right, there he is.  There he is.  Charlie Manson-looking guy.  And he's got the shirt.  On his shirt, he's got the tie with the button-down collar shirt.  And he's wearing, like, a T-shirt over it like a vest.  And on the shirt, it's a white shirt.  It has a picture of a black guy in slave chains with his arms up.  And it says, New York City and slavery.  Time to tell the truth.  And they said he teaches his students about slavery and how it occurred in New York. 
[02:28:00]  And he does it, like, with a little rap.  Oh, wow.  I wish to God they had more of.  Because his hat, being sideways like that, too, really sets off the look.  Nothing says hip-hop better than a hat that's on sideways.  Than a sideways, multicolored hat.  Singer also used rap in his efforts to engage the students.  Well, the kids.  You know, it gets the kids.  They like a gentleman who raps.  Though he admits he's an awful rapper, he dons a T-shirt and cap, appropriately askew, and presses on anyway. 
[02:28:30]  Time to learn the truth.  Our local history.  That Long Island was the land of slavery.  Still is in some parts of northern Nassau County.  Certainly is.  Young men trying to bring furniture and being thrown out by the slave master.  The slave master.  Hey, boy.  You bring that back to the warehouse.  Bring that back, and why don't you mix me up a mint julep before you leave. 
[02:29:00]  When the guy showed up with his furniture, there was a time I could have had you shot for forgetting the hardware.  Jeez.  I wish there was more of this guy's rap.  I'm sure that it was real.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm so annoyed they only have one line.  Well, perhaps.  The land of slavery.  Perhaps we can find some of it.  Yeah, we'll find some.  He's got to be somewhere there.  Hey, this trucker has a bone to pick with us.  Nick the trucker.  A bone?  Nick?  I bet I know what it's about.  Nick Fly.  Hi, Nick. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, I got a fucking bone to pick with you guys.  Who do you have a bone to pick?  All three of us?  One of us?  Two of us?  Yeah, all three of you.  You know, guys, I'm going to say something.  You make me laugh fucking 99% of the time, but this shit of us truck drivers don't care  if we kill somebody.  Like, that's bullshit, man.  And we're not using crypto monofenemy, man.  Come on.  Sir.  All right, listen.  I was so serious when I said that.  Oh, he just hung up.  He probably got to say it.  His phone right here.  And you're only mad at two of us, sir.  I didn't say that.  Jimmy means it, though, in his head.  No, but I didn't say it. 
[02:30:00]  You didn't say it.  I said it, but I didn't mean it.  You mean it and didn't say it.  This is the beauty of Jim Norton.  This is the inside the parentheses.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Don't take my bit.  I'm not doing inside the parentheses.  Oh.  Speaking of bits.  That's my bit.  I don't do it anymore because you took it from me.  Oh, you're taking all my bits.  I finally have a bit, and you're taking it away from me.  You're like the black man of the 40s. 
[02:30:30]  XM Radio is the land of bit thievery.  I'm going to have fun with this Alan Singer somehow.  If I have to go to his house and bite his chest.  All right.  What were you going to do?  I'm the one that said that the trucker is probably.  I said how bad for that trucker that he has to live with that.  He's probably going to think of that for the rest of his life.  You don't have to explain it.  That was a classic.  That was a classic.  That was a classic phone call from a newer listener that doesn't fully get this program.  Doesn't understand. 
[02:31:00]  He did the classic line.  I love you guys.  You make me laugh all the time.  But now that it's about me.  It now finally has affected me, so now let me tell you something.  And didn't he hear the way I prefaced it?  I said, we've heard our trucker listeners, and I don't think they care.  Because most of the truckers that call up are psychopaths.  They're lunatics.  And I have to think they're giggling at our stereotyping.  Of course.  And I'm not trying to get myself out of a good trashing by saying I'm the one that raised the point.  I'm just saying, sir, that you should pay attention.  Pay attention.  I hope that you, sir, who just called, I hope you hit somebody and feel nothing. 
[02:31:30]  What are you thinking, Mapples?  By the way, Donald Trump is a father again.  Is he?  Oh, that's good.  That's coming in now.  That's great.  Melania.  Melania.  Melania.  Oh, Melania.  Why don't you say that again, Opie?  Why don't you say it?  No, that's not my job.  Why don't you say it, Opie?  Come on.  Hey, that's where that bit started, nine months ago, once he was pregnant.  Oh, no, when they got married.  Oh, is it when they got married?  Yep.  All right, well, Melania. 
[02:32:00]  Melania, dude.  Melania.  It's a good name to say if you're Michael Corleone with your jaw shut.  That's Melania.  Melania.  She had a bouncing baby boy.  Aw.  Time to move on.  She's a pretty girl.  I wouldn't mind giving her a smooch.  Am I right or wrong?  All right.  Who just brought me something?  Why?  What's the problem?  I don't know.  What do you have?  I hate these cups.  Can we have fucking bottled water in the radio station?  These cups smell.  Ew.  We had to buy them from the deli because we ran out of cups.  I know, but why don't we have somebody who does fucking bottled water duty and keeps 
[02:32:30]  us quenched?  Christ's sake, these cups smell.  You know what I have now?  Hold on, Tim.  We'll get to you in a second.  Yes.  I have...  Fucking stinks.  Perrier gets delivered 10 cases a month to my house.  Jesus, how thirsty are you, diabetes?  I'm very thirsty.  It's not sugar.  It's water.  What are you, swimming it?  10 cases?  I fill up the bathtub with it and frolic.  I don't like...  Seltzered water makes me have to piss more of the bottle, the fuzzy, fizzy stuff. 
[02:33:00]  It's good.  It clears you out.  No, it's not pissed.  Seltzer is great for you.  Get flat water.  Yeah.  Flat water.  No.  Why not the bubbles?  I don't know.  Bubbles are good.  Living in a $23 million house, kicking his foot up on the gold TV set.  Water from the tap.  That's what I say.  Of course it is.  Let's go to Tim in Boston.  Tim.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I was just saying if you guys heard about that car accident up here in Boston about the president,  the moose.  Some dude...  I think it was a girl actually got a moose.  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:30]  I know what you're talking about.  I think it was in yesterday's paper or Saturday's paper.  Some girl on the highway outside Lemonster.  I have no idea really what it was.  I'm trying to be local for the people in that area.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  And the moose...  I don't know how it happened, but the...  Crashes in...  Energy or whatever.  Yeah.  Sorry, God.  Just that blasted the moose, and the moose ends up sitting in the passenger seat with  its head out of the windshield, looking around, and it couldn't move, and they had to kill  it because they couldn't...  You've got to see this picture.  It's one of the greatest pictures you'll ever see. 
[02:34:00]  The radio is even as funny because...  Woman crashes into moose, goes through the...  Yeah, right through the windshield and all that, and exactly what he said.  The moose is sitting in the passenger seat with the head sticking out of the windshield  like it was...  That's how they were driving the whole time.  Do you know how much she must...  Do you know?  I've yelled in my life, but do you know how much you scream when one minute you're listening  to the radio, and the next minute a moose is sitting next to you with his head through  the windshield?  You would have to have a hard time.  Imagine if there was someone with him. 
[02:34:30]  Especially if you've got a ticket for not having a belt on.  If we can find the picture, I meant to bring it in.  We should have scanned it for the website.  It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable.  And then they had a crane to try to get the moose out of the vehicle, and unfortunately  it had a broken hip or something.  They had a...  Yeah.  They had a...  You're kidding me!  They had to do that euthanization.  Euthanization.  And then they have to shoot the moose in your car.  You have to kill a moose in your car, and then drag its carcass back through the windshield.  That's going to really hurt the room still about you.  And you know it's shit.  You know the moose shit all over the car.  Shit all over before he died.  Hey, we got the papers from the weekend in the office. 
[02:35:00]  We might have it in there.  Oh, okay.  Fucking poor moose is walking along.  Next thing you know, you're sitting next to a screaming fat lady in Boston.  Hey, Rick.  Nothing up my sleeve.  Where's the rest of this moose?  We must have hated that moose.  Why don't you forget the moose, Arthur?  We'll find the picture.  We'll throw it up on opianathlete.com.  BW.  What's up, man?  What's up?  Man, I don't see that trucker. 
[02:35:30]  That car was talking smack.  He ain't just talking that old dumb shit.  We truckers out here.  We know what y'all talking about.  All right.  You get it.  Y'all like us?  Thank you, man.  Thanks, pumpkin.  See, you're not going to win us over by saying, I laugh every day usually, but.  So just say, but.  We're gone because we can't be bothered by that shit.  Yes.  Every time we make fun of something, it's affecting somebody out there.  Yeah.  What happened?  Nothing.  He's busy, but he had something else you want to, a couple of people have a problem  with something you said.  I don't, I'm trying to get to the bottom of that.  I have no idea now. 
[02:36:00]  Maybe it's furniture people who are mad that you think they don't give a hoot?  Could be.  Maybe.  Yeah.  See?  And now we lost the furniture people today.  Only the irresponsible ones that don't give a hoot.  They were probably huge, huge fans until you told that story, Anthony.  Now we lost the furniture people.  All the Mexicans listening on their stolen XMs.  That is a problem when you do a radio show like this.  Every day we're pissing off someone that used to be here tonight.  Yeah, someone gets annoyed.  Kent, the movie guy.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  I was wondering if you heard about Tom Cruise and what he's doing in South Park.  I heard he had the episode yanked. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, he basically, he said, I won't do promotion for Mission Impossible 3 until you guys yanked that episode trapped in the closet off the airwaves.  Here's the problem with these big corporations owning everything.  Well, I was telling Jimmy in the bathroom, this is the real censorship that happens in America.  Everyone goes after the FCC like stupid Howard.  So, FCC this, FCC that.  There's a bigger problem that people don't address.  The corporations that own the companies.  Now you might say, what the fuck does Tom Cruise doing promotion for Mission Impossible 3? 
[02:37:00]  But what could that possibly have to do with South Park?  Well, Viacom.  Viacom owns Comedy Central.  Viacom owns Paramount Pictures.  MTV, VH1.  MTV, VH1.  The Insider, I hear.  All that stuff.  Yeah.  CBS in general.  Well, it spun off.  But, yeah, it spun off.  There's still a slight connection there.  Somehow, someway.  But he won't do promotion for the movie if they don't pull that episode. 
[02:37:30]  So, now Tom Cruise has the power to censor Comedy Central.  Well, hey, that's what we're all fucking gunning for.  Tom Cruise's fucking morality.  Wait a minute now.  Is it a Paramount film?  Mission Impossible 3 is a Paramount film.  Yeah, he's got them.  Got them by the balls.  Comedy Central.  We dealt with a lot of crap with them.  And in fairness to them and Herzog and all of them, a lot of it does come from over their heads. 
[02:38:00]  Ever since fucking Viacom bought the whole thing.  They were slaves to every special edition.  And how can Tom Cruise have any effect on anything that is said, especially in humor when they shit on everybody?  Fuck the Scientologists, man.  I'm serious.  Isaac Hayes fucking backs out.  Tom Cruise wants it censored.  Everybody else can get shit on but you fuckers?  Yep.  And this has nothing to do, people.  Nothing to do with the FCC.  This isn't an issue where something illegal, as far as the FCC's broadcast standards, have been breached by the people at South Park. 
[02:38:30]  It is Tom Cruise putting his morality on you.  He doesn't want you seeing this so you won't see it.  And you want to be seen as a legitimate religion?  Well, how about Catholicism and Judaism?  All the fucking dirty laundry that's aired about them and all the things that are written about them.  I mean, they want to have attention, but they have to take it.  Scientology, you want to be seen as a religion?  Fucking act like a religion and take it like everybody else does. 
[02:39:00]  Who's this guy that he can now dictate what we see?  We're being censored by Tom Cruise.  We're not allowed to see something because Tom Cruise has said we can't see it.  Who the fuck is he?  I don't even fault him as much as I fault him for being a baby.  Fucking company.  Have some fucking balls.  You're Viacom.  Tell him how about this.  You don't promote, we'll sue your ass because contractually you are bound to promote. 
[02:39:30]  There you go.  But they'll kiss his fucking ass.  Is it a favor to promote a movie?  I'm pretty sure when you sign on, promotion is part of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, basically he's a douche.  And I will refuse to see it.  This will hurt him.  I will see it like I see all my movies.  Burned illegally and watched in my own home.  I say hoo-hoo, rip off Tom Cruise.  Shit on everybody, but not them.  Don't shit on anybody who's involved in Scientology or there's going to be a problem. 
[02:40:00]  Because apparently the laws of satire don't apply to you guys.  Yeah.  Everybody else they apply to, but not you.  I am begging people out there to just illegally download Mission Impossible 3.  Burn it and give it to your friends.  If there's one movie you must bootleg this season, make it Mission Impossible 3.  Hey, speaking of...  Oh, don't say that.  They might sue you.  Don't say that in satire and humor.  Fuck them.  It's not satire.  Do it.  Exactly. 
[02:40:30]  Do it.  Speaking of man said that.  Speaking of burning things...  Good point, Dan.  Speaking of burning things illegally.  I was listening to Ethel over the weekend.  Yes.  And they had a hilarious song about downloading illegal music and burning...  I think even burning movies and stuff.  If someone could help me with the title.  It's a new artist, but the song was pretty funny.  I'd like to give it a spin today.  Sure.  We're talking about this right now.  Maybe on the instant feedback or pal talk or whatever, if you were listening to Ethel.  It's a new artist talking about burning stuff illegally and how we're just making things fair 
[02:41:00]  because the record companies got away with murder for many, many years, so we're just  kind of balancing it out right now.  It was done tongue-in-cheek.  It's kind of a fun, silly song.  I've had enough of Tom Cruise and his self-righteous.  Ken, are you done?  I was just going to say, go see V for Vendetta if you're bored with movies.  That's pretty much it.  I don't want to.  That mask scares me.  It's scary.  V stands for a lot of things, sir.  Guy fog.  Yes.  All right.  Just a mask of Guy fog.  Vagina.  Vagina.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:41:30]  Let's go to Georgia, Colorado.  George.  Hey, boys.  Hey, George.  The audio you guys put up last week of Isaac Hayes when he was on the show, one of the local  AM stations here last Friday night was talking about Isaac Hayes.  I called him, told him about the audio.  They downloaded it.  They played it.  Between your site and Foundry, probably got an extra 400 to 500 hits because people were  calling up wanting to know where to find that audio.  400 to 500.  Yeah, we got some audio of Isaac Hayes.  He had no problem with the episode and, well, then he was in the paper recently saying, 
[02:42:00]  yeah, that's the reason he quit South Park.  We got audio where he's contradicting himself.  He got pressured.  I think they're bullies over there.  I really do.  And I think they're very influential in Hollywood and everywhere else and they fucking just muscle  anything they don't like.  He wants to talk.  Go ahead, George.  Go ahead, George.  Because what you have to say is so much more fun.  Go ahead, George.  So we'll all shut the fuck up.  You get your point across.  Go ahead and finish.  I'm apologizing.  No, no, we can't finish because every time someone gets like right to the end, you try 
[02:42:30]  to jump in over them.  We can't finish because we forgot what we were going to say.  Yeah.  But what were you going to say?  Because it's so great.  They played the audio of Isaac Hayes in his recent interview.  You said that already.  You did say that already.  What do you have that's new like about the Isaac Hayes name?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  What do you have to say?  I had a boy.  He busted out.  This guy has been waiting all morning.  Oh.  Chris, when did you start calling the program? 
[02:43:00]  Right at 7, right?  Oh, from Brooklyn, yeah.  I'm around at 7.  All right.  So he's been trying to get on the show for three hours, Anthony.  This is a question for Anthony.  This is one for me.  This has got to probably be the best phone call of the day because we hung up on him three  or four times.  Holy Christ.  Thanks for the pressure, Rope.  We rebooted the phone system.  Mars came in and rebooted.  At one point, I saw that you were on hold for over an hour, by the way.  So congratulations on that.  You know what?  You finally got through three hours later.  It's got to be important.  Opie, he's got to ask me something.  What didn't you do because you had to hang out for three hours today? 
[02:43:30]  Well, no.  Well, this is a perfect segue.  The reason why I didn't even feel like I was on hold is because I'm playing this new  video game.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  Called City of Heroes.  Yes.  Now, I thought of Anthony because I know he plays a lot of the online games.  Uh-huh.  And I never did this type of thing before.  I just bought this thing on Friday.  Uh-huh.  My ass has been in the seat since Friday.  And I'm not a big fan of City of Heroes.  A lot of people are.  What's the game about?  Bring us all into this discussion here, Anthony.  What you do is you get on, you create a character, you enter it into this online world where other 
[02:44:00]  people all over the world have made their own characters, and you interact with them in  various scenarios and settings.  This one happens to be you're a superhero type character, so you get to choose your powers  and weaknesses and body type and abilities, things like that.  And I didn't really get hooked on this one, but I could see how somebody, especially somebody  new to the genre, would just get completely engrossed. 
[02:44:30]  Hours on the game, my friend.  It's ridiculous.  And you know what's funny is that the whole week I've been listening to the worst of while  playing the game.  And you guys have been talking about EverQuest and everything.  I mean, look at me.  I turned into one of those freaking losers who's got no life playing this goddamn video  game.  See, you didn't know it would grab you.  And what's so great about the game that's got you hooked already?  Well, you know what it is?  I usually play your usual video game, shoot them up, whatever.  But to be online with a whole bunch of other people and you actually see what they're  doing, it's just hysterical.  Like, there was this one guy, you know, he went into this forest to go fight this guy  and two minutes later, he's running out with all these fucking wizards following him, shooting 
[02:45:00]  his ass.  And it was like, you could hear that Benny Hill theme in the background.  He did this like four or five times in a row.  He kept running away and coming back.  And it just, I don't know, it was just the genre, the way it's played, it just totally  hooked me.  Yeah, it hooks you in by trying to level up and things like that.  There's always some goal to achieve.  You know who's behind all these video games, don't you?  The government.  The government, this is their way of controlling us.  Ah, keeps us occupied.  All the stuff you're saying on Words of like, I have to get to level 16 and I'm saying the 
[02:45:30]  same shit.  I'm like, oh my God, I've become one of these friggin video game zombies.  I looked in the mirror, it's like my eyes look like friggin Marty Feldman after a bender.  I have like no ass left.  It's just ridiculous.  Your eyes look like what?  I'm sorry, I'm talking too fast.  My eyes look like Marty Feldman after a bender.  Wait, who?  You keep tripping over that name.  Marty Feldman.  Who was...  Oh man. 
[02:46:00]  Do they?  Do they?  You know, I told you guys once before and I tried to stay away from funny analogies and  little aside.  Yeah, we hear, yeah.  Your eyes may look like Marty Feldman, but that joke looks like Harry Chapin.  Hey, well I hope you enjoy the game.  I'm glad you're killed in the dance out there, babe.  What about me?  My game pick though, my game pick comes out tomorrow, The Godfather.  Oh, that's right.  Coming out tomorrow.  They're saying it's going to be a... 
[02:46:30]  Looks like kind of a Grand Theft...  Well, you know.  Looks like kind of a Grand Theft Auto type thing, but set in the Godfather movie.  And I think they got some voiceover from Marlon.  From Marlon before he dropped there.  Yeah, they got voices from Marlon.  And James Caan, I think, did a little too?  Yeah.  Hey, Chris.  Yeah.  You did alright, man.  Why not?  I got a mic in front of me.  It's gotta be true.  We really thought you were going to bomb, but you did alright, Chris.  I did what I could.  We gotta compliment a little more. 
[02:47:00]  Well, I love you guys.  You guys are great.  You kept me going the whole weekend.  Keep me company, playing this goddamn game.  Go get him.  Level up, my friend.  Alright, man.  And, Opie, stop picking on people in diners, please.  Oh, the ketchup incident.  I'm kind of mad at myself that I didn't dump the ketchup on the bread.  No, it's better you.  You're up.  You're doing good.  Fucking, you were grown, man.  Look at Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I didn't put Jimmy's on him.  What the fuck's the matter with you?  You handled it.  You argued it was done.  I should have held him down and killed him and raped him with a bottle.  You did it.  You had to do it.  I'm playing right into Jimmy's paranoia. 
[02:47:30]  He just knows we're just one incident away from blowing this whole thing on.  Oh, whether it's on the radio, in our personal lives, it's just...  I have a mortgage.  Fucking Hugh's sitting there in his chair making us, well, you know, we hired them.  It was just...  Oh, no.  Leave me.  Hey, this South Park thing is really funny.  Matt and Trey are...  Somehow you'll dump ketchup on someone and I'll lose my house.  Yeah, well, Matt and Trey, we love these guys.  We really do.  How they're handling this thing is very funny.  You want to read that, Ant?  Because there's big words that I'll fuck up. 
[02:48:00]  South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have all but declared war on the Church  of Scientology following member Tom Cruise's successful move to have the episode Trapped  in the Closet pulled from U.S. screens.  Screens?  Screens.  Screens.  Yeah, from TV screens, right?  Maybe this is done...  Is that one of the big words?  Maybe this is overseas.  Well, wouldn't it just be pulled from TV?  TV.  No, this is UK.  Oh, is it?  Of course it is.  Pulled from the telly? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  No, pulled from U.S. screens.  Yeah.  Right, U.S. screens, which would be...  Look at the other links, you sweet angel.  UK it.  Retirement specialists.  Teeth and why we hate them.  Dot net.  Wow.  The show's creators.  Good work.  I like that last one. 
[02:49:00]  Jesus.  Can you have that last one for me again?  Wait.  Teeth...  Wait, no, no.  The last...  Teeth and why we hate them dot net.  Alright, well...  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  It's my favorite.  We got the pictures of the moose sitting nice...  The moose looks ridiculous.  It really does.  What an ass this moose looks like.  It's like...  When it goes through the moose's head, what happened?  What happened?  What happened? 
[02:49:30]  What happened?  What happened?  Alright, Anthony, go ahead there.  What a goose this moose looks like.  Look at him.  He's got a light in his face.  All he wanted to do was eat a berry.  Next thing you know, he's fucking in a Fiat.  He's a fucking asshole bleeding.  I feel bad for the poor little moose.  Look at him.  Yeah, I feel bad for her, too.  She's on her way to work.  That is a big moose.  Probably a jealous husband.  You'll fuck the moose.  You'll fuck the moose.  A moose suck your cock?  Did the salvage fuck the moose? 
[02:50:00]  Kill Vicky.  Kill the moose.  Kill me.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  The show's creators to declare to Variety.  So, Scientology, you may have won this battle, but the multi-million year war for Earth has just begun.  Temporarily anosonizing our episode will not stop us from keeping thetans forever trapped in your pitiful man bodies.  Curse and drat, you have obstructed us for now, but your feeble bid to save humanity will fail. 
[02:50:30]  Hail Zenu.  They're totally picking on all of their religious icons.  Yeah.  I don't know why other places haven't picked up our audio.  It's been played a few times, but we got gold, and we sent it out to the media.  Scientologist Hayes said, there's a place in this world for satire, but there's a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs begins. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, that's what he said.  That's what he said recently, but do we have the clip of Isaac Hayes again?  It's unbelievable.  Yes.  We have it on a disc somewhere.  Stone responded, in 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons, or Jews.  He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show.  This is such hypocrisy and self-important bullshit, Tom Cruise.  I really hope this hurts his career.  Dude, nothing hurts his career. 
[02:51:30]  I hope it hurts.  I know.  The guy's impenetrable.  Fucking stupid jumping up and down on the couch, the psychological rants.  Just shut up already.  Teflon faggot.  Just imagine the power he's got in Hollywood, because they all have stories on him and they're all too scared to go with it.  They're all scared shit of this guy.  He's one of the biggest box office drawers ever.  Yeah.  All he's got to do.  So was Burt Reynolds.  Imagine if I said I wouldn't promote somewhere, they'd say, yes, you will, and they'd smack my fat face. 
[02:52:00]  All right, so once again, for the last time, Scientologist Hayes, this was said very recently.  There's a place in this world for satire, but there's a time when satire ends, and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs begins.  Well, this is what he said on our show a couple months back.  Hey, my question is for Isaac Hayes.  Yo.  Hey.  Yo.  What did you think?  You're Scientologist, right?  Yeah.  Okay, what did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on South Park about Scientology?  Well, what?  With Cruz in the closet.  Yeah, that was a great episode. 
[02:52:30]  So they reran it, I think, last week, too.  Yeah, one thing about Matt and Trey, they lampoon everybody.  And if you take that shit serious, then I'll sell you to Brooklyn Bridge for $2.  Did Matt and Trey get that?  You've got to realize what they're doing.  Yeah, that's what they do.  I'm sorry, did Matt and Trey get that audio?  Has that been sent to them?  We send it around to pretty much everywhere.  We got our people.  Send it right to them.  Send it to them, man.  I'm a little lammo.  Well, Matt and Trey, if you take that shit serious, I'll sell you to Brooklyn Bridge for $2. 
[02:53:00]  If you take that shit seriously, I'll sell you a moose and a passenger seat.  How silly does that moose look?  That is a silly-looking moose.  Can somebody tell the moose, the car doesn't fit you, Mr. Moose?  The moose has too many friends that are afraid.  That's like Tom Cruise.  They're too afraid to tell him, you look like a silly goose, Mr. Moose.  Mr. Moose.  Wouldn't it be fun to hit the washer and watch him go, like, shake his little moose head? 
[02:53:30]  Like, the last thing that could possibly annoy him is a little jet of water in his face.  I would hate to have that moose in my car because he puts right through the windshield.  If it rains, it's going to get all over the place.  And plus, the moose probably goes duty all over the seat.  And you have a wet moose at the end of the whole thing.  Do you know how scared the moose must have been right there?  I just hoped that the car was still driving and someone actually saw this taking place before she finally slowed down.  I would find the nearest toll booth.  Right.  They shot Mr. Moose in the causeway. 
[02:54:00]  He's dead.  Look how they messaged my moose.  I hope one guy, as this moose drove by, was a little high.  Yeah.  I hope there was one a little high person that went right to an N.A. meeting because he saw a moose with a vehicle.  You don't even have to be a little high.  I hope it was just a carload of people completely sober, but only one guy saw it past them.  And had to tell his friends what he saw.  And no one believes him. 
[02:54:30]  No, I did.  There was a moose in the passenger seat.  Shut up, stupid.  Shut up.  And his face was hanging out the windshield.  I swear to you.  That's mean.  It was probably just a boy with Down syndrome.  No, I'm telling you.  It was like Dino.  He looks like Dino.  Yes.  It looks like Dino in Fred's car.  I feel horrible for the moose because his moose arms are all jammed up.  They're folded under himself.  He can't even open the glove box.  Poor fucking moose.  He's probably so scared and in pain and in shock.  Yeah.  Look, it's an accident. 
[02:55:00]  So, I mean, if I were her, I would have jerked off on the moose's head.  That's what I would have done if I showed up.  I just would have...  Because no one in recorded history has ever jerked off onto the face of a moose as it sat in the passenger seat of a car.  No one.  Now, Jimmy, we have to research that.  I'll bet you somebody's raped a moose.  I'll bet you some farmer in Canada, of course, climbed up and fucked a moose.  After he hit it.  No one's ever jerked off on the face of a moose while it just sat there and took it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Canada. 
[02:55:30]  Spencer.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Well, we're better than a moose.  Yeah, no doubt.  I saw the picture, too.  No, dude.  Is there a video of this?  No.  Sorry, what's that?  Got to be.  There's even a better picture in the paper over the weekend.  Are those photographs?  That looks like video.  That looks like video.  That's video from probably...  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  It was local news.  You're right.  Let's get some video of that poor blinking animal.  I know it's going to be very sad slash hilarious.  All right, Canada.  What do you got, man?  No, I was just calling about those online games that Anthony played. 
[02:56:00]  Yes.  I played one called Lineage 2.  I don't know if you've heard of that one.  Yeah, I heard of that one.  Never played it.  It's a pretty good game.  Anyway, there was actually a guy about a year ago that died from playing it too long.  Something blew up in his head or whatever.  How long ago?  I had to put a year, year and a half ago probably.  Some guy in Korea also, I think.  One of those Southeast Asian nations.  The guy was just sitting there, a big fat mess, and he played until he dropped dead.  He didn't eat or drink anything. 
[02:56:30]  He just sat there and played for three days straight and just dropped dead.  You know what?  Good.  Exactly.  Good.  Good.  If you do that, if you die that way, what could you possibly have done that we would have benefited from?  I like seeing him just kind of fall over.  I think he had a lot more problems than just playing that damn game.  If he falls over and dies, and then how long will his character just stand there not moving?  Because his character would just stand there looking around waiting to move.  Nothing.  He probably has a bunch of haggle bobs come up and kill him. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  But anyway, I mean, and then it's all those Chinese farmers, right?  Because that's their job.  How weird would that be, Anthony?  So your character's just frozen?  Yeah.  Game's still going on.  Game's still on.  And then just someone from another country kills you on the online version, and all he  thinks is, well, that was a little too easy.  Why is that guy just standing there?  And then goes, ah, that's weird, and then just moves on.  Moves on, doesn't know that the guy's just dropped dead right there.  He just killed the guy of the guy that's dropped dead.  Meanwhile, you're face down in a bag of chips.  You're starting to smell up the apartment. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Also, I don't know.  No, also.  No, also.  You get one comment, Canada.  Oh, give him the also.  He's from another nation.  Hold on.  This one's funny.  This one's funny.  All right.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Spencer says this is funny.  We have a funny thing coming up.  You have to hold.  Pull over, folks.  Just not in the right lane.  Hold on there.  Dan, are you ready for the funny?  Bring on the funny.  Everyone, hold on, sir.  Sir, hold on.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  I've never found my funny. 
[02:58:00]  Hold on.  I've got my funny.  He's looking for his laughing hat.  God damn it.  I have a moose sitting anxiously awaiting a laugh.  All right.  You're waiting.  You ready?  What?  Dan, find them before someone gets slapped.  Okay.  Where are the funny?  On World of Warcraft, there is a guy that's...  Shut up.  Wait.  Wait, sir.  Sir, for the love of God, hold the joke.  All right.  I'll hold it.  Hold the joke.  We're looking for our funny bones.  Where's one?  There you go.  Give me to put on a seatbelt. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Spencer with the funny.  Okay.  On World of Warcraft, I don't know if you heard that one as well.  Yeah.  There is a guy that died in real life as well, so they had a real life...  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  I did not hear it.  I was looking at the moose photos in color.  Say it again.  No, not quite done.  What?  Anyway, they had a guy that...  They had an in-game funeral for them.  So they had a bunch of clans that came up.  Oh, I don't know if you don't put on a seatbelt. 
[02:59:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  That's really fun, Brad.  That's terrific.  You guys are all laughing still.  Oh, what?  What was the plug line?  What happened?  What happened then?  What happened?  A bunch of other clans came up, and they PKed the whole thing. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I don't believe it.  God damn.  That's funny, dude.  All right.  So where's the card?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually was laughing. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, no.  No, Spencer.  Not you.  You hoping idiot.  He wasn't laughing at you.  We're done with you.  He's laughing about something else.  This could only mean one thing.  Jimmy Norton's reading the comics.  Oh, Jimmy.  Now, I got to get a copy here of the...  Yeah.  What's...  What's the...  What's the...  All right.  Daily News Comics.  Oh, my God.  Sounds like a good one.  Gotta love the comics. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, my head hurts.  I gotta love the comics.  You can only find them.  All right.  How are they?  Page 47.  There it is.  You just passed it.  No.  That's...  Now, pull out the...  Oh, look how easy that is.  All right.  Which one are you looking at, Jimmy?  Beetle Bailey.  Beetle Bailey.  One of the classics.  In this one, it's only two pals, thank God.  The cook is talking to Sarge, right? 
[03:01:00]  And the cook...  Wait.  The cook is talking to Sarge, I think you said, right?  And the cook's looking over his shoulder.  And the cook goes, how long will he be on guard duty?  And Sarge goes, till 3 a.m.  And the next panel, it has Beetle Bailey drinking a cup of coffee.  And the cook goes to Sarge, I'll get him a few more cups of coffee. 
[03:01:30]  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Beetle Bailey has seven cups of coffee in front of him.  One, two, three, four, five.  And he's holding a cup.  I'll get him a few more cups of coffee because he's on...  He's not going to do it, he's going to fall asleep.  Oh.  Oh, how do people get any work done?  Is that when they're reading the funnies? 
[03:02:00]  That's why they're called the funnies.  Oh, my head.  You know, they would be called the not-funnies if they weren't funny.  Oh, thank God Marmaduke's not in this one.  No?  Oh, my God.  Maybe he is.  Yes, he is.  Oh.  Oh, this is a good one.  Maybe don't look at it.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You're going to lose it.  Look.  All right.  This is a really funny one.  Mm-hmm.  Um, it says, this is Marmaduke, and the caption reads...  Well, what's going on in the cartoon? 
[03:02:30]  Well, I don't want to say, because I want to read the caption first.  All right.  It says...  It says...  Don't want to spoil it on it, obviously.  It says he loves that new car smell, and Marmaduke's head is poking through the windshield, and he's just shit all over a passenger seat because he's been hit in northern Boston somewhere.  Who saw that coming?  And there's a lady, and she's standing there with her hands on her hips, and she has shit in her socks, and she's angry at Marmaduke. 
[03:03:00]  Marmaduke.  He loves that new car smell.  Does he?  Holy crap.  All right.  Why don't we, uh...  I don't know.  Why don't we do something?  Jesus, look at the Flying McCoys.  There's a new one called the Flying McCoys.  I hate new comics.  And I almost said something really offensive. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Man-server's...  Yeah, I got to take a leak.  Man-server's own penis, and then throws it at officers.  Ooh.  Hot.  It's in the I'll show you section.  When we get back.  When we get back. 
[03:04:00]  Holy shit.  What happened?  Happy Typing Girl is topless.  No, she's not.  She is topless.  No, she's not.  I just want to watch all those dummies in the room switch to her cam.  No, she's not.  No, she's not.  I don't know if she's ever topless. 
[03:04:30]  Not even when she showers, she wasn't topless.  Hey, we're getting a good question off the instant feedback.  Jimmy was in Atlanta being a star, a stand-up star.  Oh, by the way, I went and saw Louis C.K. at Caroline's over the weekend.  Caroline's, the greatest comedy club.  Amazing.  Love Caroline's.  There's only two clubs I go to in New York now, Caroline's and, of course, the Cellar.  Caroline's, what you call a class journey.  Comedy Cellar and Caroline's, they take care of us.  Mm-hmm.  They have no problem taking care of us.  They're at the crossroads of the world, by the way. 
[03:05:00]  Louis C.K.  Obviously, he's got the HBO show with Jimmy Norton and stuff.  Oh, my God.  First time I've ever seen him do stand-up.  The fucking guy's hilarious.  Yeah, he's great.  Hilarious.  Yeah, so is HBO special.  I won't do it justice.  I'm not even going to attempt to do any of his material, but freaking hilarious.  Give us a little.  Come on, no.  Give us a little.  I ain't playing into your trap.  I don't feel like it today.  And then I talked to him, like, for 20 minutes afterwards,  and Jimmy's not going to say it, so I will.  Louis C.K. is saying Jimmy is one of the best actors you'll see, 
[03:05:30]  even though he makes believe he thinks he stinks.  He's unbelievable.  So he's saying Louis is a lying sack of shit?  Yes.  Louis fibs.  And he tells the story how Jimmy was supposed to be in a few episodes here and there,  and he made, I think, every single one, right?  All 13, yeah.  All 13.  But he was supposed to be like, ah, you do this scene,  and then maybe you'll do a scene in a couple of episodes later.  Like a little character called Kramer, perhaps.  Right.  He says he's so good that they had to write him into more stuff  and that he's in all 13 episodes.  The freaking studio audience were just completely losing it 
[03:06:00]  every time he was on screen or whatever or on set.  Yes, but that was my attempts at acting.  They would all laugh.  And what they were losing was their lunch.  Oh, stop it, Ant.  They weren't losing that.  And it's going to be on HBO after Entourage in June.  That's just an unbelievable spot to debut a new show for HBO.  Yeah, we're very happy, man.  So sometime in June, right?  Yeah.  Him chasing those Henson puppets out.  I did tell you that.  I don't think you told us on air.  That fucking, it made me laugh so hard.  We did, I did, my shows in Aspen were with Louis to promote the show. 
[03:06:30]  We did two just Norton-Louis shows,  and then we did one, it was the Fuck You Aspen show.  I didn't tell that story?  No.  It was the late night naughty show, and Louis was going to host it,  and I was one of the acts on it.  And I was supposed to close it, but then they said Chappelle might stop by,  so I'm like, I'm going to go on earlier,  because I had to fly the next morning to come home so I could be on Sabbath.  So we're doing the show, and before the show, there's these Henson puppets,  where they're like, they're guys, they hold these giant foam things over their head, 
[03:07:00]  and there's like five people to operate two puppets.  The one guy will hold it on his head, and the arm, there's a woman that has,  like she's standing right behind him, and she has her arm up to operate the puppet arm,  like almost like she's wearing it like a sleeve.  So picture five people holding shit over their heads,  moving these giant foam, awful puppets.  And they wanted Louis to interact with it at first,  and Louis's like, I'm not doing that, that's fucking terrible.  And he was a little, he had like a drink,  and they're outside before our show starts doing their thing in the audience. 
[03:07:30]  The crowd's kind of laughing, and we're backstage watching on a monitor,  and we're just, me and him are just going how much it stinks.  And he goes, I should just go out there and interrupt this.  And I'm like, fucking please go out there and do that.  I never thought he'd do it.  I'm like, dude, please just go out there and fucking shit on them.  And he just goes, you know what, fuck this.  He walks out onto the stage unannounced,  grabs the mic and says to them, just, all right, look, get the fuck out of here.  Go. You're not a fucking pig. 
[03:08:00]  You're just a guy holding a pig over your head.  What's the matter with you?  He fucking shreds these people.  But it wasn't, to me, it was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  The audience hated him for it because they were enjoying these puppets.  And he's screaming at them to fucking get out.  And they're trying to play along like it's part of the thing.  And he goes, I'm not talking to you.  You're not a pig.  You're just a fucking guy holding a pig over your head.  What's the matter with you?  And then they leave and he says something about the unfunny crap you just did. 
[03:08:30]  It was fucking beautiful.  What a blow for all stand-ups to chase those faggoty puppets out of the fucking stand-up arena.  That's great.  It made me so, it was fucking, it was, I've never been that happy even watching myself get blown.  It was not as satisfying as seeing those dumb puppets leave.  His comedy was unbelievable.  Hilarious.  He was great.  And I want to thank Greg Charles and the rest of the gang at Caroline's for treating me so well every time I'm at.  I care you.  Unbelievable.  They're just stand-up guys at Caroline's. 
[03:09:00]  Here's the moose story, by the way.  We've got the audio of the news story.  A woman from the central Massachusetts town of Sterling is lucky to be alive tonight after a head-on collision with a moose.  This was in Lemonster last night.  The moose wound up in the front seat of her car.  For more on this story, we join Jim Boyd live in Sterling.  Well, Natalie, I'm not far from that incredible scene that happened last night in Lemonster.  And I've talked to a couple of people who were there.  They say they would not have believed what they saw if they hadn't seen it with their own eyes. 
[03:09:30]  But there were pictures, and they certainly tell the story.  Just sort of disbelief, shock, almost.  Everybody that was at the scene was, like, screaming, thinking, this moose is sitting in the front seat of this lady's car.  It was pretty astounding.  Lonnie Delecchiai heard the call for a moose-against car on his scanner.  So he grabbed his home video camera and headed to the scene.  We thought we'd just take a quick run and we thought we'd see a moose on the road, but we saw something different.  And there it was, a 500-pound moose in the passenger seat of Julie McDowell's Mercury sedan. 
[03:10:00]  She had hit the moose, and somehow it went through the windshield and landed upright in the passenger seat.  Tow truck driver Robert Condon was also on the scene.  I was surprised to see the moose was still alive.  And I just wanted to get it out as safely as possible.  Condon helped to extract the moose from the car once firefighters had cut the roof off.  But the moose had been seriously injured in the crash.  It had to be put down.  The driver, Julie McDowell, suffered only a few scrapes and bruises  and was sent home after a brief visit to the hospital. 
[03:10:30]  Now, a relative tells me that Julie's main concern seemed to be the glasses that were broken during that incident.  And she had to go out today and have them replaced.  But surely she has a story to tell, and certainly one that she will not soon forget.  Reporting live in Stirling, I'm Jim Boyd, Newsletter 5.  I hit a moose and my glasses broke.  I can't see, goddammit.  What a subset of twat.  Really?  That's what you worry about.  My glasses. 
[03:11:00]  Poor moose.  Shitty driving.  You probably didn't have your glasses on.  You killed this regal animal, you dumb bitch.  Yeah, that's what we deal with in this world, though.  Everyone thinks they're the most important person alive.  And the father actually was interviewed in Boston.  He said, he saw the video, he just said, thank God it's not a Negro in the passenger seat with my daughter.  That's Massachusetts.  It certainly is.  You think that's the best story of the day?  I would think, yeah.  We could do a little cute vote.  Yeah?  Do a little radio bit.  What are you going? 
[03:11:30]  Man severed his own penis, throws it at officers.  And it landed in the cop car.  Passes his seat.  Before cops threw the book at him, Jacob Fick threw something unusual at them.  His penis.  Ha ha ha.  Fick, 33, cut off his own penis during a northwest side rampage Wednesday morning.  Why?  How?  When confronted by police, Fick hurled several knives and his severed organ, the officers, police said.  That's anger.  Officers stunned him with a taser and took him into custody. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, your cock is cut off and they tased you.  The beautiful thing is this.  He obviously had one more knife to throw.  He made a conscious decision.  I need two things to throw.  I have a cock and a knife.  The cock has to go first.  Otherwise, I have nothing to cut it off with.  Doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital reattached Fick's penis Wednesday, sources said.  He was listed in good condition Thursday, according to hospital spokesman, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:12:30]  Why would you reattach it, by the way?  Why won't you leave it off as a lesson?  Yeah.  Let him learn.  You cut your penis off, it's going to stay off.  You're not going to have it back.  He's charged with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of criminal damage to property.  He's a dick.  He told paramedics he was distraught over problems with his girlfriend in Poland.  That'll fix it.  She lives in Poland.  He had an episode.  Your boyfriend threw his penis at police officers. 
[03:13:00]  Well, let me go over there and patch things up.  Yeah, now it's time to really get back together with him.  Yeah.  Start anew.  Police arrived to see him smashing car windows.  Fick then broke into a house down the block.  A group of six or seven officers assembled in front of the house.  Dolan said the occupants were not home.  Fick was bleeding when the officers arrived and may have already cut off his organ.  At that point, this guy came running out naked with a handful of knives.  You fucking women see what you do to us. 
[03:13:30]  Holy shit.  He started throwing knives at the police officers that were 10, 20, 30 feet away.  Fick threw his penis during the confrontation, too.  Imagine the cop, the ribbing he's going to take, the one who got hit with that for the rest of his fucking career.  He got hit with a dick.  He then went back into the house and re-emerged with another handful of knives.  Wow.  He threw his cock and then went back in for more weapons?  God, I have nothing else to throw.  You really only have one shot with your cock. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  Make it count.  It's just one.  You only have one.  You could throw your nuts.  At least you have two.  You could kind of get your bearings with the first one, fire for effect, and then hit him with the second one.  I wonder what he thought as his cock, especially if it was a bad throw, it landed in the hedges.  Oh, like what a waste of my cock.  At least about you, I hit a cop in the mouth and it goes, oh.  It's just like, hey, hey, watch, drop the knife.  And like your dick goes in his mouth.  At least like as you're falling down from loss of blood, you go, my cock went right in his mouth. 
[03:14:30]  The last sound you want to hear is.  Uh, let's see.  Dolan sneaked to the side of the bungalow's front steps and stunned Fick with the taser.  Fick fought back when officers went to restrain him.  And then here's a quote from Dolan, one of the officers.  About ten feet from the front porch, right on the sidewalk, was his penis.  You know how they really should have stunned him?  Holding up a mirror and say, sir, you're throwing your own penis.  If that doesn't stun you.  You know what? 
[03:15:00]  I just stepped on it like a bug.  Can I say how awful John Edwards' face is, by the way?  That's all I had to say.  I'm just looking on my TV and he's awful.  Dumb little teeny mouth.  He looks like Lars Ulrich, but he doesn't.  Yeah, he does kind of look like Lars.  You know how the ants got right to the penis, too, as it's sitting on the sidewalk?  You think, immediately, like, picked it up and started carrying it, trying to get it into  a little ant hole?  Yeah, before the cops got to it.  This is interesting.  This doesn't taste like cricket.  Trying to shove the big cock into the ant hole.  It's not fitting.  You know how Barnett can find one of these?  Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.  Quiet, quiet.  Let's see. 
[03:15:30]  Horrible.  That's an awful story.  As long as the penis, here's something we can learn today.  As long as the penis is placed on ice and reattached within a few hours, the success is usually  pretty good.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I don't know if it works and feels the same, though.  Yeah, I'm sure.  The time you jerk off, you're afraid of pulling the...  Yeah, how long after they attach it can you then start jacking, or else, you know, before  it pulls off?  30 years.  Because I was shaved.  I shaved my pubes.  They're completely shaved.  That's just horrific. 
[03:16:00]  It's not.  It's really...  It's not.  I do a little shave down, but that's taking it too far.  That's too much, Jimmy.  We've talked about this in the past.  It's not.  No, no, no.  I'm not taking my dick.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  There's no reason for that.  It's a fetish thing.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  You want to be a hairless little boy.  No, dude.  Yes, you do.  All right, the men with you want to be hairless.  That's not true.  That's not...  Stop saying that.  No, I like the...  Women like it.  Women like it because it's just...  They do like it.  Some of them are creeped out by it.  You know what?  Yes, they are.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  I don't care if they are or not. 
[03:16:30]  I want a shaved box.  I'm going to give you a shaved, might I say, delicious mouthful.  I prefer to shave it.  I like it hairless.  All right.  Even if I nick the shaft a couple times shaving.  You guys, we missed the obvious joke with this severed penis story.  Yes.  We definitely did.  That's why we have the greatest listeners in radio.  Kirk in Idaho.  Kirk.  Hi, guys.  Kirk.  Hey, how big of a faggot is this guy if he can only throw his cock ten feet?  Punching out, boys. 
[03:17:00]  Didn't even think of how far he threw his cock.  Look at all the jokes coming in, and we just passed that little detail by.  Well, dude, maybe when you're...  Bud in Texas.  Maybe when you're throwing your cock, your arm says, I can't do it.  You understand?  It's something inside of you that might not want to throw it that far.  Bud in Texas.  Go, bud.  Hey, I just want to say that story sounds like the old Superman show where the guy runs out  of bullets and throws the gun.  Yeah, they'd shoot at Superman and shoot him in the chest, and it would just bounce off,  and then he'd take the gun, look at it, and throw it at Superman, and Superman would 
[03:17:30]  dodge it.  Yeah, he would always duck.  And move out of the way.  He'd stand there for the bulls, but he would duck when the guy threw the gun at him.  Yeah.  And this guy, yeah, kind of ran out of knives and threw the penis.  And if you like that joke, we have a joke about, you know, Gilligan's Island and the  coconuts and the radio.  Why the professor, yeah.  What?  Could make a radio out of a coconut, but can't fix the hole in the boat.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's a good question.  That's circa 1984, hack brick wall behind you.  I know.  And if they can make a radio out of a coconut, why can't Bob Denver fix the lump in his head? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Fuck him.  Why?  I'm smoking pot, you're 75.  Oh, pudding head.  Exactly.  Ha-choo!  Oh.  It sounds like, it sounds like, it sounds like cold stew in a fucking metal bowl.  Ha-choo!  Takes that wacky Gilligan hat off.  It's filled with tapioca.  Ha-choo! 
[03:18:30]  The mate was a puddin' headed man with a plate until he died.  He sees in his sound like a thermos full of liquid.  Ha-choo!  He sounded like a thermos full of liquid.  Ha-choo!  Ha-choo!  Ha-choo!  The tumor started getting big.  Ha-choo!  The tiny skull was full.  Ha-choo!  Ha-choo!  Ah, shit. 
[03:19:00]  Give us another minute.  Yeah.  All right.  Gilligan, the skipper to radiation and a bedpan to shit in.  Did you hear the Francine story?  No.  Holy crap.  Oh, Jimmy.  Dude, Francine came in with a couple stories that she taped with the boys.  Don't tell them a second of it.  I will not.  Do you want to play the whole thing or just the-  I want the big highlights. 
[03:19:30]  You want the highlight?  Yeah, we don't have time for it.  Dude, it could be the biggest laugh you ever have.  And because of this, we're going to do a show soon on this channel, Storytime with Francine.  Yeah.  She impressed us enough to get a couple hours.  Finally has a story worth telling and she tells it.  I hope I don't fuck this up.  I'm going to guess.  So, why don't you do the setup, Anthony, because I'll get to where it gets good.  Okay.  She was telling a story and this was really shocking.  She got herself pregnant.  She was pregnant. 
[03:20:00]  When?  When she was 17 years old.  Oh, I thought recently.  She got pregnant by some black guy and had no money for an abortion or anything.  Her friends told her they were going to give her money, but she really didn't know what the fuck she was going to do.  And things just worked out, I guess.  Ready for this?  Okay.  I don't know where the story picks up.  I think this is about right.  So, I'm...  Could have just grabbed the baby while he was in there. 
[03:20:30]  No.  No.  I wish I could have done that.  But I'm at the dentist's office.  I'm doing like a dental thingy.  And I think it was a cleaning, not an orthopedic.  What?  Because that's for your teeth.  And I like felt blood coming out.  So, I was like, I wonder what this is.  So, I called my girlfriend.  This story gets funnier and funnier, Fransi.  And she was like, I was like, listen, I got blood coming out my vagina.  And I'm pregnant, so this shouldn't be my period. 
[03:21:00]  So, she was like, well, I don't know what to do.  So, what I did was I was like, well, maybe I'm having my period anyway.  So, I jammed a tampon up my crotch.  And I called another chick.  And she was like, oh, my God, are you crazy?  Take that tampon out of your crotch and just go to the bathroom.  So, I went to the bathroom, took out the tampon, and voila, all this red shit came out.  It was the baby.  Oh, my damn.  It came out on its own. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, man.  You were covering up so much pain with that.  Oh, my God.  And the baby came out to the toilet.  I'm cheap, oh, boy.  Giving out cigars that say it's a blob.  Is that the happiest miscarriage you've ever heard?  Wow.  She was so happy that that frigging thing fell into the toilet.  Normally, that's the way a guy feels when it happens to a girl. 
[03:22:00]  How unbelievable is that?  Wow.  She miscarried.  She was three months also.  Three months pregnant.  So, you know it was like Dinty Moore.  Dropping a can of Dinty Moore in the toilet.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Little bones, like fish bones.  Oh.  They kind of sit together.  And how happy she was.  Oh, man.  Just laughing and laughing.  Yeah, but you know what?  She's like Hawkeye in the last mash.  Yeah.  That's a baby.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  But you know something? 
[03:22:30]  I questioned her about that and said, you know, do you feel anything?  You're laughing really hard.  Is that covering up pain?  And she's so stupid, I think she was honestly happy.  Just.  Yay.  Hooray.  A miscarriage.  Great stuff.  Francine's kind of retarded.  Yeah.  Just a little.  She's going to tell some more stories soon.  Danielle from Texas.  What's up, Danielle?  I just wanted to tell little Jimmy that I love a shaved cock. 
[03:23:00]  Thank you, Danielle.  You do, right?  I do, because if I'm going to be down there, I don't want to have to move stuff around.  I just want to get to it and do my thing.  That's right.  What's your thing?  Tell me.  Play with the balls.  You know, you mind the stepchildren.  You go all the way down the shop.  Hold on, hold on.  Mind the stepchildren?  Huh?  Hold the balls, right?  Yes.  And a little squeeze, not a big one, just a little one, just to let you know that I'm there.  Go all the way down, deep throw to do a little sucking, and it's great. 
[03:23:30]  Do you ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you, show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  That's all I had to say.  You like a nice shaved cock, do you, huh?  I do.  I do.  I'm going to shave my stuff for you.  It's only nice that you shave yours for me.  I'm filling up a little bit.  Excuse me?  I'm filling up a little bit in my privates.  I don't know.  It seems a little creepy. 
[03:24:00]  It's not creepy.  Let me show you.  No.  Well, that's all, boys.  I just wanted to say that.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  All right, Daniel.  Just look at the top.  No.  Right there, look.  Is that my dick?  No.  It's just the top.  Go ahead.  No.  All right.  I'm not looking over there.  You're not going to get me.  All right.  We're not looking.  You're lost.  You can show pal talk.  How's that?  No, pal talk.  I can't show my dick on pal talk, but I just.  I can show the half rod I have.  All right.  Show them the half rods.  Get it over there.  No.  No, you can't see it from over there.  Well, the camera's on you. 
[03:24:30]  You've been on camera all morning.  Oh, there you are.  All right.  Pal talk.  There you go.  Jimmy's showing you his.  Just on top of my pubis.  David.  What?  David.  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Gary, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  Love you out here in California.  Multiple midget sighting.  Yeah.  The San Diego Little People's Association had a conference at a Hilton, and the lobby was 
[03:25:00]  covered with them, dude.  Wow.  There were step stools at every sink, step stools at every payphone, tables, all of them in  the bar, teenage little ones.  It was frickin' nuts.  Go to the website, stlpa.com.  Great.  Stlpa.com?  The San Diego Little People's Association.  With S-D-L-P-A.  Do they all look like the same person, but they just had different hairstyles? 
[03:25:30]  No, they're all dressed different.  They're little punk rock teenagers.  They all look the same.  No, you couldn't tell how old they were.  So there's some sitting in the bar that you thought were kids, and there were ones you  thought were adults that were playing on the stairs, acting like kids.  It is, actually.  It's just one midget with a bunch of mirrors trying to convince the world that you shouldn't  be squashed.  Okay.  Love you guys.  All right.  Thanks, Gary.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  So there you go, pal talk.  There's Jimmy's cock.  Let's go to Ryan, the trucker. 
[03:26:00]  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I want to know, can I get my rig anywhere near FH Riley's?  Wow.  Rig parking, huh?  Wow.  You know, I mean, no, I don't have to get right there.  I mean, somewhere close enough where I can get a cab, man.  I'm clear out on the West Coast, and I want to come back there and meet some of the other  freaks.  Ant's from Huntington.  Wow.  I don't know what you would do.  I would say on a nice day, he'd have to park probably up by the Big H Shopping Center, 
[03:26:30]  Opie, and then walk down.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Or get a cab from there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, that's what I was curious about, man.  I just want to come back and find the show.  You guys ruled.  All right, thanks.  Yeah, because it's a small town, so I don't know.  I don't know how you're going to pull that off.  Of course, there'll be nothing left in or of your trailer if you park it up there.  Yeah, good point.  Huntington Station.  Oh, bad, huh?  Yeah, definitely.  Hey, Jimmy, when you come into Reno, brother, I want to see a show.  I've never been out there.  I'd like to just go to the Bunny Ranch. 
[03:27:00]  It's 11 o'clock already?  Yeah.  Jimmy, you come out there, and I'll take you to the Bunny Ranch.  Dude, Dennis is a good friend of mine.  I think he'll just cop me, so I wouldn't ask you to spend your money, but thank you.  I would love to go to give a report.  By the way, speaking of my brother's restaurant, I've got to give him props.  F.H. Reilly's 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington.  I'm going to be there someday during the week, by the way, and we'll do late night karaoke  in the near future.  Yes.  The New York Times did a review on F.H. Reilly's over the weekend and gave it a good review.  That's pretty solid.  The stupid review guy killed him on a few things. 
[03:27:30]  That just wasn't fair.  But the criticism they gave, I read the review.  Oh, you read the review?  But it was, the criticism said, like, wow, with a little work, this can be fixed.  He really didn't shit on it.  Well, the guy came there three weeks after opening the doors when my brother was still  trying to get his staff together and stuff, but complimented him on the food.  Yeah.  And that's a good sign.  So the review, the whole review's up on whackbag.com.  But getting a good review from the New York Times is not bad for a Long Island restaurant.  Especially since they're saying that the food was good.  They weren't complaining about the food.  All these added desserts, they cook too much one dessert.  It's such minor criticism. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, they got a little too crazy with their detail.  Yeah.  And my brother was just slightly bummed.  I'm like, dude, welcome to the world where people criticize you and write about you and  never get it right.  Yeah, just fix those things.  The teeny things.  They're all fixable.  But, you know, he did get a good review in the end, so that was pretty exciting for him  and the restaurant.  All right?  What do you got over there, Ant?  Is that not happy?  No, a baby girl.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I see his bosoms.  I see her.  She's in her panties and a little top, and she was sitting up. 
[03:28:30]  Is she in her underpants?  Wadding on her bed.  I like a girl in her underpants.  In her underpants.  Why is she not moving?  She just looks at the front of a ship.  It's like torso.  Let's go to Aaron.  Aaron.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Want to play what I learned?  Yeah.  I learned that interns wear dresses to get air time.  Oh, very good.  We did learn that today.  Let's say hi to Schmitty in Massachusetts.  Schmitty, we end with you today.  Make it good.  Today I learned that a 500-pound boost from the passengers' seat still won't get you in 
[03:29:00]  the couple of lanes.  No.  I see him on her.  That sucks.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
