<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed and hilarious recounting of a disastrous television pitch meeting. Opie and Anthony, along with Bill Burr, described their experience pitching a show concept – a blend of *Mythbusters* and *Jackass* – to A&E executives at a dilapidated production company.  The segment highlighted the stark contrast between this company's rundown office, complete with a malfunctioning elevator, and the more professional setting of Telepictures.  A memorable moment involved Opie giving a brownie to the security guard, sparking a conversation about a hypothetical movie heist.  The hosts also shared an email from the production company brimming with unrealistic confidence, contrasting sharply with the meeting’s immediate failure.  The hosts reflected on their career progression, highlighting how far they had come from attending such desperate pitch meetings.

Following this, Opie and Anthony shared another disastrous pitch meeting story, this time featuring a writer they described as a "fucking psycho." This writer delivered a chaotic and wildly unrealistic presentation, completely failing to read the room, as evidenced by the executives checking their watches and eventually discussing the weather instead of the pitch.  The writer's post-meeting behavior, including offensive remarks about a female executive, further solidified the meeting's disastrous outcome.  To cap it off, the limo driver abandoned them, forcing a 30-block walk back. Opie then read an email expressing his own embarrassment and lack of confidence in the production company.

Richard Cheese and his understaffed band (bass player "laid," drummer a "flake") then appeared in studio.  He performed, including a Pink Floyd cover ("Another Brick in the Wall") and a Snoop Dogg song, interspersed with humorous banter with the hosts.  Audio of Steve-O's extremely intoxicated and destructive appearance on Adam Carolla's show was played.  The hosts promoted their "Whip Em Out Wednesday" hotline.  Richard Cheese later briefly returned to give away merchandise before announcing his retirement (with a planned reunion tour).  The hosts received several celebrity shout-outs for XM’s five million subscribers, and there was a brief cut to sexually explicit content.

The conversation then shifted to Mary Carey, who was running late.  The hosts reminisced about past chaotic shows with Mary, including one where a guest was made to cry.  They discussed Bernie Getz’s upcoming appearance, expressing apprehension due to his past behavior.  They briefly touched upon President Bush’s upcoming address on the war on terror.  A discussion about Michael Brown, former head of FEMA, and the criticism he faced for his handling of Hurricane Katrina followed, with audio clips from a Congressional hearing being played.  The hosts reviewed listener-submitted Opie and Anthony movie trailers, filled with profanity, sexual innuendo, and nonsensical humor.  They then promoted Gamefly.com and concluded with a patriotic "America Fuck Yeah" segment before a commercial break.  After the break, they mentioned their show's one-year anniversary on XM and their upcoming Halloween party.  Mary Carey finally arrived, discussing her recent weight loss and dental work.

The main focus then turned to Mary Carey, who recounted a past incident where the hosts made her cry (which she didn't remember).  She discussed her weight loss, attributing it to cutting out late-night Taco Bell and excessive drinking.  She showcased her breasts, prompting a discussion on "boob sound effects."  Mary discussed her non-monogamous relationship with her boyfriend (who was in the studio), her bisexuality, and her disillusionment with some men in the porn industry.  She detailed her experiences with colonics in graphic detail, leading to a humorous exchange about anal sex greeting cards and a call-in segment providing ideas.  Bill Burr briefly joined the discussion before it shifted back to Hurricane Katrina.

Professional wrestler Mick Foley (Mankind) then called in.  The conversation covered his correspondence with John Irving and Christy Canyon, a humorous anecdote about a letter exchange with Canyon and his literary appraisal of her autobiography.  He discussed his upcoming *MTV Cribs* appearance, his messy house, and his audiobook narration.  A significant portion focused on his new book, *Scooter*, including a reading of Richard Price's blurb.  He shared a story about losing his ear wrestling Vader.  His upcoming wrestling return and *Piper's Pit* appearance were also discussed.  Mary Carey was frequently referenced and admired by Foley.  A “Talking Scarface” doll was mentioned.  Carey promoted her appearances and website.  The segment ended with a Stephen Lynch song, "Gerbil."  The final segment focused on Foley’s experiences and his new book, mentioning his correspondence with John Irving and Christy Canyon, his upcoming *MTV Cribs* appearance, and the details of his new book, *Scooter*.  His wrestling career and his ear injury were discussed at length. The appearance of a "Talking Scarface" doll was mentioned, and Mary Carey promoted her work.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zeltzer.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This spicable ass hat.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully, he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You blundering bag of poop. 
[00:04:30]  You found me incompetent.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  You will be molested.  Oh, Billy.  Oh, ah.  Oh.  Was that supposed to be some kind of sick joke? 
[00:05:00]  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Mom!  I love the Lord.  I have to do this now.  Greatest movie ever.  We were talking about that yesterday.  Yes, we were.  We were talking about a lot of things after the show yesterday.  Any time me and Opie got to go through any kind of security.  And they're in every building here in New York.  And the guy runs through his list.  If you have an appointment.  I always think of that scene in The King of Comedy. 
[00:05:30]  Where the author is booked on Jerry's show.  He goes to the back door to get in.  And the old security guard's got the list.  And he goes, I'll check the list, sir.  You're not on the list, sir.  I will check again, sir.  No, sir.  Your name is not on the list, sir.  Sorry, sir.  And he's every security guy in this city.  Every single guy is that fucking guy.  No, sir.  Could you look again?  I'm scheduled to be on again.  I'm looking again, sir.  No, your name is not here, sir.  And all these building security guys here in New York City think their shit don't stink. 
[00:06:00]  Well, they've been told by the mayor now that they are part of the security of New York.  They're the biggest jokes out there.  First line of security, Opie.  Yeah, they think they could hold back Al-Qaeda.  Right.  From their building.  Really.  They're the first line.  Do you know if a guy with a bomb comes into the building?  Who's the first guy?  Not the guy going through the revolving door leaving for lunch.  Not the guy sweeping up the lobby.  It's the security guy at the desk.  And I had a quick little test that I did today.  Yeah.  As far as our building goes. 
[00:06:30]  Uh-huh.  I haven't even told you about this one yet, Anthony.  You're doing tests on your own time?  I want to see how good these security guards actually are.  Yeah.  Because if Al-Qaeda's coming, I don't want them taking over our building, right?  Of course.  Very important building here.  At least our building.  At least our building was smart enough.  You want to be safe?  Sure.  We all do.  I want to play chopsticks on 57th Street.  At least our building finally got smart and fired the drunk guy that slept on the job.  Did they fire him?  I thought he was on vacation.  Oh, no. 
[00:07:00]  He's done.  He was my new pal.  He's done.  I kind of was getting attached to that guy.  I turned the corner with the guy, too.  Didn't you?  Yeah.  When we first got here, couldn't stand him.  Shouting matches every morning.  Yelling every morning.  The guy was so pissed off that he had opened the building before 8 o'clock because he had  a cushy job before we started doing mornings.  No one worked in this building before 8?  No.  Then all of a sudden, he has to open the door for us at like 5 in the morning.  It was ungodly at that hour.  We were actually getting here at 4.30 or something.  Yeah.  And he wasn't happy about that at all. 
[00:07:30]  No.  Because he would stumble awake and stagger to the door with the keys.  I'm like, this is the building security guy.  You know he used to just sleep during that time.  Yeah.  It was total nappy time for him.  Yeah.  There was rumor of alcohol.  I don't know.  But he's gone.  Yeah.  New guy downstairs.  And I was just thinking about the security we had going over to A&E yesterday.  So I had a whole tray of brownies that I brought in for everybody today.  Oh.  And I go to the security guard.  He's the guy, right?  Mm-hmm.  You get through him.  You can do whatever you want in this building. 
[00:08:00]  That's it.  I go, hey, you want a brownie?  He didn't even think twice.  Grabbed one.  Really?  He got a good one.  Now, in a movie.  What if it was a place?  That would have had some kind of drug in it.  That's what I'm thinking.  And he'd have been knocked out, and then you and Hans Gruber and all the other guys could  have come in, and it would have been over, Johnny.  Well, yeah, he would have passed out, and then you'd have to drag him down the hall and  into that nice closet.  Yeah, drag him by his shirt, shoulders.  Yeah, where he stays with his legs dragging on the ground.  White socks showing. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, of course.  Where you put him in the closet.  Where he stays asleep until the mission's done.  You've got to take his shirt off, though, and put it on so you look like the security  guy, so when all your guys come in, you could give him the little nod.  But they don't look at him, you just kind of nod.  But then in the end, he wakes up just in time to, you know, foil our mission.  Yes.  Well, maybe a hero comes in and saves the day.  Or a hero.  Like the Punisher.  The Punisher.  Other comedians call me the Punisher. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, God, you're one of them.  No, you're the Punisher.  God, don't shoot me.  Yeah, Joe Rogan went off on Carlos Mencia yesterday on our show.  Oh, my God, did he.  I guess there's a video of Joe Rogan going off on Carlos Mencia up on FoundryMusic.com  and OpieAndAnthony.com.  Here's our dilemma.  Carlos Mencia is booked for the show next week.  The Punisher will be on our show next week.  The Punisher.  Well, I think some people in here are going to be punished, if I may say.  The self-appointed Punisher.  The self-appointed and anointed Punisher. 
[00:09:30]  That is a name you absolutely can't pick for yourself.  I can't believe that went by me.  And I didn't even like.  Rogan was so going off, I never stopped for a second.  Like, wait a minute.  They call you the Punisher.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  Who?  Find me a person.  His name is brought up.  It's Carlos or Mencia.  Yeah.  That's it.  No one goes, you know who's coming to Caroline's this weekend?  The Punisher. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I'm doing a gig with the Punisher.  Who?  Yeah.  Carlos Mencia.  Oh, why did you call him the Punisher?  Sounds like a wrestler in one of those shows.  Those shows where it's like on basic cable.  Not Vince McMahon?  No, not that level.  There's like eight people in the crowd.  It's all those Mexicans that wear like the masks.  It's at a high school gym.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's all echoey.  And whenever they hit the, yeah, when they hit the canvas, it sounds like it's made out  of like aluminum. 
[00:10:30]  Coming to the ring.  You tell him the Punisher's coming for him.  Yeah, those are the names, the Punisher.  I want a nickname now.  Like a real nickname, because I hate this Opie crap.  Well, you just got to give it to yourself.  I want to be the something.  You want a the Punisher?  Yeah.  Yeah, and just say everybody calls you that.  Yeah, the name has to be, it has to start with the.  Uh-huh.  Like the Punisher.  I want to be like.  Well, let me just scroll through instant feedback, and we'll find you one.  The.  No?  I want to be.  I know.  The douchebag.  The douchebag. 
[00:11:00]  The ass wipe.  I'm really setting myself up for a bad one.  My shallow ego.  I don't know.  That's why they call me the douchebag.  I don't know if I can take this.  All right, I'm going to take that back.  Our listeners can be cruel.  You really just lobbed it over the net.  Yeah, because certainly.  Because I'm dreaming of like, you know, my name's going to be the executioner.  The destroyer.  Right, right.  The destroyer.  Something really cool.  That fits my personality in a way that makes it all right.  But no, it's going to be like the douchebag. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, see, you don't want to be marshmallow ass.  That never, never sounds intimidating.  You can't say, hey, watch out for me on marshmallow ass.  I think you can pick up some women like that.  Actually.  My friends call me marshmallow ass.  Marshmallow ass.  Oh, my God.  You treat me.  They call me the punisher.  Prozac from Whackbag is saying that Ed Asner actually did give you the name Destroyer, Opie.  Oh, that's right.  Ed Asner.  Yeah, there it is. 
[00:12:00]  That's my nickname, according to Ed Asner.  The Destroyer.  The Destroyer.  And Ed Asner called him that.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  I am the Destroyer.  What, you step on his glasses or something?  Oh, he hated me.  Absolutely hated me.  No surprise there, I know.  Whackbag guys really do give themselves their own names, right?  Right.  Just like Prozac, you know?  Hey, my name's Prozac.  Get that name.  You gave it to yourself, you know?  But everyone calls him Prozac on the message board.  No, you just need the expression people.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  That's not anybody.  People call me.  Well, the listeners are being really kind this morning.  Are they?  Opie's new name, Millionaire Douche Cunt.  The Taint Master.  The Javalog Boy.  All right, you know what?  Let's move on to other bits.  The main event.  Someone on the phone.  The puppy killer.  The kid toucher.  That's Jim Norton, man.  Shit dick.  Shit dick.  Lovely.  Fuck face. 
[00:13:00]  Fuck face.  Yeah, they're coming in like crazy now.  The I cower when a guy punches my rearview mirror, man.  You're not supposed to remember the bad stories.  You can't put a sentence in behind the.  It's supposed to be the one word.  Yeah.  That sums it all up.  The coward.  The destroyer.  I like the destroyer.  Coward.  How about the.  How about.  Picks that one for themselves.  How about the Gregster.  The Gregster. 
[00:13:30]  That's a great one.  Anyway, someone is like, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  Opie, back up.  You guys were at A&E yesterday.  We want details.  Oh, their security is very good over there.  They have ex-cops, I guess.  Because one of them remembered pulling me over and giving me a ticket.  How weird was that?  He said for a seatbelt.  He had everything right.  But it could not have been a seatbelt ticket.  Because I just do not.  The second I'm in my car, that seatbelt goes on.  And I don't take it off until I get out. 
[00:14:00]  That's how I work.  And he said it was a seatbelt ticket.  But I think he gave me an uninspected or something.  Some low-level ticket.  But he remembered.  He gave me my name, everything.  He said, I pulled you over.  It was about five years ago.  You had the seatbelt and you were speeding.  I remember the speeding part down the belt.  I was doing about 90.  Down what he later told me.  The cops call the killing field. 
[00:14:30]  That's great.  You know.  Could you put up a fucking sign?  It's a part of the Belt Parkway.  Right by Bay Ridge.  Right after the Verrazano.  It's kind of before.  A little before and a little after the Verrazano.  Where I swear to God, you're at Daytona.  It's a turn.  It's banked.  It's beautiful.  And you can't help but go very fast there.  And the cops call it the killing field.  And I got pulled over there.  And he remembered everything.  But ex-cops working there.  That's a security.  You know.  You've got to hand them your license. 
[00:15:00]  They enter it on the computer.  And then spits out.  They take your picture.  Yeah.  In the lobby.  They take your picture.  And the little ticket thing that you put on you.  It gets spit out with a picture of you on it.  But then you can't even use that.  Because it's got a big stop sign on it.  It says stop.  So if you're walking around the halls.  The security sees that big stop sign.  They stop you.  Stop you.  The security guy has to then take a sticker.  And put it over the stop sign.  So if you figure out a way to hack into the computer.  And print out one of those things.  You still aren't going to go through the halls. 
[00:15:30]  This for A&E.  What's going on at A&E that a terrorist is going to want to take that over?  If they take over a TV network.  Aren't they going to want one that people are watching NBC or something?  It wasn't about A&E though.  We learned it was because the Dutch douches are upstairs.  Oh.  The Dutch consulate is in the same building.  And right then when I heard that.  The Dutch douches versus the Punisher.  The Punisher.  Right when I heard the Dutch consulate was upstairs. 
[00:16:00]  Then I just went.  Oh.  Okay.  Everyone's after them fucking Dutch.  Who's after the Dutch?  And how can they get anything dumb as.  Forget it.  Never mind.  I'm not even going to try now.  Fuck.  Fuck.  You were trying to say something and then you couldn't.  I had a joke about the army in wooden shoes.  Hey.  It's the mumbler.  He's stuttering.  Fuck.  I know it's going to work too.  Yeah.  I just knew. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  Anyway.  So I guess we got to back up.  Ooh.  And talk about our latest TV meeting.  Bill.  I'm sure you can be involved in this fine discussion.  Bill's done some television.  The guy's actually been on TV shows.  But for every guy like Bill Burr that's been on TV on successful shows, you've been pitched  a lot of dumb ideas, right?  And had to take a lot of dumb TV meetings.  I've been the guy pitching the dumb idea.  Yeah.  People don't approach me with the TV idea.  They look at me like, what do you got? 
[00:17:00]  Well, we go into, we have, we've taken a lot of phone calls, say that, especially when  we were off the air.  Now, when we were off the air, we were looking for something to do.  Couldn't be radio.  We weren't allowed.  We were being paid by Infinity Broadcasting to stay off the air.  That's the position they put us in.  Because if they didn't want us to go up against Howard, it's a fact.  Right.  But they could, we could do other things.  So our agent was fielding phone calls from, I don't know, are they production companies? 
[00:17:30]  Low-level production companies.  Yeah.  You know the name that turns up with a funny little graphic, maybe, at the end of a sitcom?  You know?  Sit, Ubu, sit.  That old one.  That's a production company.  They're the ones that have the idea, that figure out who they want to do this, and go  to the network that the show is airing on, and say, look, here's the idea for the show.  Here's the idea for who we want to do it.  We want it to air on your network. 
[00:18:00]  And that's the, here's the idea.  That's the pitch.  We don't get the name that you see at the end of Survivor, the end of Cops, the end of  all your favorite sitcoms, Simpsons, things like that.  We don't get that.  We get the ones you just haven't heard of.  Right.  And they pitch these shows that they have an idea for, I guess they have an idea, for  Opie and Anthony to participate in. 
[00:18:30]  They've been trying to get us on TV for years.  No one can figure it out.  No one can figure it out.  Everyone seems to think there's something for Opie and Anthony to do on television.  We don't want to do putting cameras here in the studio, because Howard's doing that.  Imus is doing it now.  It just...  We would do that if we could get our own spin.  You know, if we could come up with our own spin.  Yeah, if there's something a little more unique about it.  But no one has been able to figure out that spin yet.  I'd rather just have the cameras like that and actually do it and put it on the web, because 
[00:19:00]  I really don't see that as a fucking television show.  I see it as a web thing, so people can punch in, check the show out as we're doing it live.  You don't have to worry about editing things down to find the exciting moments and do that  for a show.  You pop in.  All four hours are online.  You can watch when you want.  Something's happening.  You can pop in.  Things like that.  We've been trying to turn these cameras on that are in the studio.  Washington watches us every day.  And we're like, well, if you guys are watching us, let the fucking fans watch the show. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, just give them the URL.  It's overhead cameras.  It's no big deal.  You're not going to see anything too crazy.  But, you know, hardcore fans would love to check in and see, oh, wow, that's where  Ann sits.  That's where Bill Burr is sitting.  And if you have something going on on the console here, they could get in.  Yeah, but for some reason, we just can't figure that out.  Yeah.  One of the many things we still are trying to figure out.  You're supposed to be eating a bagel.  Yeah, exactly.  I think that's a big, is that Sesame?  It'll be as exciting as watching, you know, paint drying.  But still, there is an audience for it.  People would check it out on the internet. 
[00:20:00]  But that's why I think it's more conducive to online than a television show.  Right.  But our agent is just obsessed with this one production company.  I don't even want to mention the name of these guys.  Because they have such problems that I don't want to be the one that, you know, destroys  them.  Yeah.  They got such problems.  And two, three years ago, we met with these guys because we had nothing else and we were  reaching for anything.  You know, we had a really high-powered meeting with Comedy Central. 
[00:20:30]  We were supposed to take over the man show.  We were about to negotiate with those guys.  And then Infinity, well, actually, Viacom.  Viacom.  Same company that owned us for the radio.  They're the ones that threw us off the air.  So they pretty much didn't want us on any of their properties.  Yeah.  And they own Comedy Central.  To this day, by the way, that's still going on.  Oh, yeah.  They don't want us on any of their properties.  Although, Spike TV called yesterday.  So we'll have to see what that's about.  And I think that's still part of the Viacom family.  I'm not positive. 
[00:21:00]  So we met with this low-level production company about two years ago.  They had this idea that the more and more Ant and I looked at it, it's basically Mythbusters.  It's Mythbusters.  It's Mythbusters.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I love the Mythbusters.  And two or three years ago, Mythbusters didn't find an audience yet.  Mythbusters is a very big show now.  Yeah.  And we've had the guys on a few times.  We love them.  Adam and Jamie.  Very fun guys.  We love the show.  We love having them on the radio. 
[00:21:30]  But they're pitching this show that is basically Mythbusters.  And it was the same show they were pitching two years ago.  And now they're revisiting it.  And our agent got us involved with these guys again.  Uh-huh.  So we're supposed to meet at their office yesterday at, what, 2 o'clock or whatever.  So we show up.  Anthony's already upstairs.  I'm down on the sidewalk waiting for Anthony so we could, you know, talk it over a little bit.  Yeah.  Because we know we're going into a disastrous situation.  Now, I just noticed.  Now, we had been to other meetings. 
[00:22:00]  We went to a meeting at Telepictures, which you see the logo come up after a lot of the talk shows.  A lot of the afternoon talk shows Telepictures did.  And, yeah, I'm sure you've seen their logo.  We've been to meetings there.  And when you walk into the Telepictures offices, the hallways are lined with those giant photos of the personalities that they handle.  Shows like...  The shows that they have on.  Rosie O'Donnell.  Rosie was part of Telepictures. 
[00:22:30]  Some of those...  Jenny Jones.  Jenny Jones was one of them.  With Telepictures.  All those judge shows.  All the judge shows.  Judge whatever schmuck.  Yeah.  They were all just lined.  The hallways lined.  All the offices.  A lot of movement going on.  People walking around the hallways.  The latest furniture.  Right.  Well designed.  All modern looking.  And tip-top shaped.  Tip-top of me.  All sorts of awards, like...  Awards I don't even know. 
[00:23:00]  There were Emmys.  Clios and Emmys.  Emmys.  Gold records.  Gold records.  And they don't even do recordings.  I saw an Oscar in the corner.  I don't even know what that meant.  Have we gotten the point of professionalism across?  Yes, yeah.  With this scene we're painting here.  Of a top-notch TV production house?  Right.  Fake foliage in the corner.  Of course.  The cleaned leaves.  A little maid comes in every day and wipes the leaves down.  Well, we walked in yesterday.  Well, can I pick up from...  So, I find out that you're already upstairs. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So, I go in what looks like a broken down warehouse, basically.  Just a...  It was like a warehouse building.  Dude, that elevator was a one-person elevator.  Well, I was in there with...  It was so small.  I was in there with another guy and I got to the floor.  Yeah.  And I just sat there waiting for the door to open.  He goes, oh, no.  You got to push it.  You got to push the door open.  I'm like, oh, that's great.  It's one of these elevators that, like...  It's a freight elevator, basically, that they're making believe is a regular elevator 
[00:24:00]  because this is the only space they can find in New York.  But it was small.  That's what I'm trying to say here.  It wasn't even a freight elevator where you could fit freight in it.  There were two other people in there with me and I swear to God we were all touching  each other.  Yeah.  It was that small.  And they're officially gay now.  Did they have, like, pictures of, like, snuff films that they had done on the walls?  So, when you walk down the hallways, yeah.  I remember this bitch.  We offed her in Utah.  So, I go through the door that is now, I guess, the reception area.  And it's all boxes and the secretary that's doing nothing. 
[00:24:30]  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah.  There was...  I saw nothing on the walls except dirt.  I noticed...  Now, people might joke that I'm a germaphobe or clean freak or something.  I'm absolutely not.  No, Anthony's not.  I'm really not.  This place was so unkempt.  It was just...  The floor looked like it hadn't been vacuumed ever. 
[00:25:00]  There was just dust from, like, the ceiling on it.  Like, ceiling tile particles on the floor.  Everything was covered in a layer of dust.  Like, it had just been sitting there.  The lamps on the desks, completely dust ridden.  Everything, dust everywhere.  Old wood paneling.  It just looked like an old...  Like a boiler room.  I was going to say, yeah.  You know where...  You know how boiler room is, like, the low level of the stock market, basically? 
[00:25:30]  They set up banks of phones in these places until the cops come and arrest everybody.  And then they go to...  Just to sell them bad stock.  And then they go somewhere else.  And then they run off and set up camp somewhere else.  But you're not worried about making the place look good.  Everything's written on, like, flash paper.  Yeah.  So they get dumped in the waste paper basket and set it on fire.  So Ant's in there, in the office, getting the big pitch from the head, Muckety-Muck.  Yeah.  And his minions. 
[00:26:00]  And I walk into the office, and I'm like, hey, what's up?  And he goes, this guy goes, sit down.  And he points to this chair that's like, how can you explain it?  It was a see-through glass type of chair.  It was a chair you would see on Ronan Martin's Laugh-In.  Or Clockwork Orange.  Yeah.  Clockwork Orange.  Very mid-70s.  It was plexi.  It was, like, you know, Lexan, whatever that see-through stuff is. 
[00:26:30]  Completely see-through.  And that round, molded, modular, cut-out-of-an-eggshell-shaped thing type.  Taken from the set of Rota.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes.  Exactly.  You're right.  Still knows.  And that egg, taking it, you know, cut-out-of-an-egg-shaped thing,  is sitting on a trumpet bell-type pedestal that's sitting on the floor,  and it swivels.  And this guy is pointing to the chair, very proud of the chair, going, sit down. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And I'm like, why is he so excited about the chair?  Take a seat, me droogies.  So I sit down.  Food.  All right.  So I sit down in the chair.  Don't call me dim no more.  And the guy goes, you know what you're sitting in?  I'm like, no.  Well, when we produced Puff Daddy's Making the Band or whatever that show was. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Number two.  I don't even know.  It wasn't even the original.  I, I, I.  Um, we bought $100,000 worth of furniture, and they were going to just throw it all out,  so we decided to take some of it back to the office.  So that chair was used in the production of Making of the Band 2.  Ooh, now I'm, now I'm flattered.  He's been bragging about the Making of the Band thing for many years.  We cannot find any proof that he ever worked on the show, which is creepy.  I didn't even know that show came out yet.  Maybe the, maybe it didn't.  I don't know.  So, dude, the, the killer thing about what they do or don't do or anything came when 
[00:28:00]  Opie asks them, hey, um, what are you working on now?  Because when you go into a production company, you kind of like to know, if you can't see  the pictures on the wall of all the personalities and all the shows, what they're working on  at the moment.  And the answer that came out.  He was, he said he's doing a reality show based on a, on a, it's an equestrian reality  show.  So it's a reality show people based on horseback riding, horseback riding. 
[00:28:30]  And then anything like Olympic horseback riding and Olympic style.  What are some of the other things he said?  The untitled Donnie most project.  And then he's doing something for the travel channel.  It's a tentative title is I still got it.  Then there's something about where to go.  Donnie most in the nineties.  And what were some of the other shows, the travel channel where you, it was something 
[00:29:00]  for the travel channel where you take somebody's job.  It's sort of a glamor job for a week was that, that, yeah.  And then he's just like, yeah, the last year has just been crazy.  Everything has come together, but he's mentioned these shows and we're like, holy shit, he's  still doing nothing.  And then the office had absolutely no hint that, uh, this, this company has been successful  on any level. 
[00:29:30]  No, no hint.  Right.  Yeah.  Because they're so busy with all the successful shows.  All these things.  They don't have time to hire cleaning people.  No.  Put photos up.  So we're ready to go.  You know, if you, if you, the whole point I was making about the dirty office is that  if you, if you have an office where professional people are coming in, uh, celebrities, agents,  management to get shows off the ground, whatever, you would think you would want to make a nice  presentation, right?  Uh, you would, you would think it would be vacuumed and the lamps would be shined or something, 
[00:30:00]  just something.  And that just wasn't the impression that they were giving off.  It was very obvious that they needed us way more than we needed them.  And, uh, we're going to make that point in a second, but, uh, so now, you know, we're  going over the pitch because we're going over to A&E and that's the only reason we took this  meeting because we're like, well, he did get a meeting with A&E.  That's kind of strange.  Something's got to be going on.  Maybe he's got his shit together since the last time we talked to this guy, uh, two,  three years ago.  So we're, we're, we're getting the pitch together in our heads because we're going to have to present 
[00:30:30]  this to the big wigs at A&E.  And his idea is, uh, Mythbusters meets Jackass.  How do you, how do you combine those two shows?  Well, well, it's like Mythbusters without any of the interesting science that goes along 
[00:31:00]  with it.  Yeah.  It's, it's like Mythbusters with lawsuits.  With lawsuits.  Right.  With lawyers and, and loss of finances being involved.  Right.  Just like Mythbusters, only you spend some time in court also defending yourself.  What myths were you guys going to bust?  What was like the example?  That's a good question, Bill, because, uh, well, basically the pitch of the show is like,  you know, you're a bunch of guys and you always wondered things. 
[00:31:30]  Like, I wonder what, how it would be to like ram a car into an above ground pool, let's say.  Right.  What would that be like?  What would that be like?  But see, now that we have a TV show, we could, we could see how that's like.  Now we can all get together.  And we do it.  Me, Opie, Jimmy, Bill, you're cordially invited.  Can I, can I sit in that day?  You can sit in.  I'll be in the pool.  You can be in the pool with little swimmies on and we'll ram the car into it.  And this is what we hear a lot.  Now, what myth are you, are you?  There's no myth.  It's just stupid things that you wondered about. 
[00:32:00]  There's no myth.  How long does a car last if you do put sugar in the gas tank?  That type of crap.  And we, because Ant and I have such great chemistry and we're brilliant, this is all stuff they were telling us.  I'm not trying to be a cocky asshole today.  You know, the chemistry between you guys.  You guys are some of the funniest guys ever.  You guys will just do what you do.  They fill in the hole by appealing to your ego.  There's a huge hole in this pitch that, yeah, exactly, is filled in with you guys will just do what you do best. 
[00:32:30]  We have a concept, a car, an above-the-ground pool, car, drive-in to pool.  All right, all that other time for the hour, you guys just do what you do.  So then I'm like, I'm starting to ask the hard questions.  I'm like, well, do you have a list of things that you were thinking we should do on this show?  He goes, oh, my God, I got hundreds.  And then he goes, Jamie or whoever his assistant was, go get the list. 
[00:33:00]  And this kid comes back with a three-page treatment for the show that lists only four ideas.  And that's not what I was asking for.  I was asking for the big list to get a feel if this guy is even creative enough to come up with interesting things that we could show on TV.  After a year, you'd probably come up with a lot of ideas, I would think.  He still has about four.  One of his big ones is to drop a piano through a house.  Through the roof of a house.  Look, Derek just went.  I couldn't hear him.  I saw his hands go up and saw his mouth go, what? 
[00:33:30]  I swear, and that's everyone's reaction to this, including the fine folks at A&E.  That's going to be one of those shows where they, like, the whole half hour before they drop the piano into the house, they just keep raising it up.  What do you think is going to be happening here?  That's a pretty heavy piano, Opie.  What about that?  I mean, I can't even come up with anything funny about it.  It's so fucking awful. 
[00:34:00]  And that is what the people at A&E were picking up on.  I have to find this one.  Just keep talking, Ann, about whatever.  Well, all right.  Well, we meet with them at their offices, their dirty offices.  Please save the limo for me.  Well, that's where I was going.  We're ready to go to the big A&E meeting.  I just got to find this one.  We all head downstairs and, hey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you head downstairs and I'm done.  All right.  Well, now I'm stuck in the stairwell.  What do I do?  Go back upstairs in the office and explain to Bill. 
[00:34:30]  The door closed behind me and now it's locked, Opie.  I understand.  What do I do?  Explain.  I think I might have found it.  Explain to Bill what this guy thought.  What it's like to be locked out.  Oh, okay.  Here it is.  Here it is.  This is an actual email.  Don't open this.  Anthony, just do what you do.  All right.  Just do what you do.  All right.  All right.  Listen, we're back in the office.  We're back in the office.  All right.  Focus, focus.  Back in.  And I found the email on my Crackberry here that was actually sent to me before the meeting. 
[00:35:00]  Uh-huh.  It says, dude, totally pumped.  Ready for a big...  And then it's a question.  Ready for a big picture that happens within two to three years as in a movie.  And this is his idea.  We make a killer, culty, hilarious show.  The DVD home video sales go nuts after year one.  Think Dave Chappelle.  He only did $60 million after his first season.  $60 million.  How many people are going to want to see the piano over and over again? 
[00:35:30]  So you're going to be buying the DVD.  So he's like, think...  You're going to want to revisit that moment.  Right.  Of course.  And then think of the extras.  The stuff that wasn't aired.  You know, all the hilarity that was on the air?  There's maybe two more hours for every segment that wasn't that we could do with behind the scenes, the DVD extras.  Right.  Commenting on them raising the piano up.  Maybe hitting a key.  Oh, yeah.  So here it is again.  We make a killer, culty, hilarious show.  Then it goes to DVD and we sell like Dave Chappelle did. 
[00:36:00]  Only $60 million.  That's no problem.  We'll blow up right past that.  And then about mid-year two or late year two, we do the feature movie picture deal.  Think jackass what they did.  That movie only cost $4 million to make and it did $150 million worldwide and it still rents out the wazoo.  And then he writes, is that a great freaking scenario?  Hey, it could happen.  See you Tuesday.  They call me the wazoo.  So he's getting us all pumped in the office because now we have to go over to A&E and punch this horse shit. 
[00:36:30]  This horse shit.  Because now we're stuck.  And I'm thinking, I'm like, we're missing something here.  He got a meeting with A&E.  This guy has no business getting meetings with A&E.  That's horrendous.  In my opinion, right.  The whole Blackberry thing.  I mean, you're just predicting success.  Okay, we make a movie, right?  Yeah.  And it's so fucking huge that we make another one and then another one after that.  You know, like the Back to the Future trilogy. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  Right.  Isn't that amazing?  There's no idea there.  There's no idea there.  No.  I see us doing all three at once.  To save my, like Lord of the Rings.  We will do all three of them at the same time.  Thus saving money and then just making, I'm seeing, guys, I'm seeing gazillions of dollars.  If I may use gazillions.  Picture this scenario.  You're playing wiffle ball in Central Park. 
[00:37:30]  A member of the Yankee organization is walking by.  They need a first baseman.  Just go with me on this one.  That's what this is.  Then you sign with them.  You make zillions of dollars.  You're fucking Jessica Alba.  Right.  We get endorsement deals now.  We go for the sneaker endorsements.  Could happen.  See it, too.  Now you're having trouble with steroids.  But we get you off of that.  And it works out as a positive.  Now you're doing the talk shows.  Yeah.  And people find out you could act. 
[00:38:00]  Now you're cast in Die Hard 7.  That's what he's doing.  So hear me out.  This isn't too crazy.  Hear me out.  Hear me out.  So the whole time we're like.  The head of the studio dies.  You're wearing a suit that day.  So they now give you the job.  It happens, man.  Now you're making the movies.  That's right.  You're making the call.  Con, we're flying you off into Con. 
[00:38:30]  So we're just.  And dude, you're set for life.  So we're just sitting there going.  Something doesn't make sense.  This guy's full of shit.  But he got a meeting with A&E.  He got to go to A&E.  Yeah, that was the sticking point with us.  Is the fact that.  All right.  There is a meeting, though, with A&E.  Remember.  There is a channel.  Remember, by the way.  There is a channel.  I have passed by it.  Remember, by the way, when we were on commercial radio, we took many meetings with telepictures.  Key to this story.  Coming up. 
[00:39:00]  So we leave the office finally to go over to A&E.  And waiting outside for Anthony and I is a limo.  Because they're treating us like stars today.  It's the limo.  That's short for limousine.  That's right.  Limousine.  Limousine.  You hear that, Derek?  Limousine.  That's right.  Only the best for the boys.  So we go downstairs, right?  There's a driver that just doesn't want to be there.  He's in between driving kids around to proms and stuff. 
[00:39:30]  This guy is just a low-level limousine guy.  But it's a limo.  It's a limo.  And that's fine.  I'm not trying to trash the people out there.  But if this guy is trying to treat us like rock stars.  There's, you know, you could go up many levels even in a limousine.  It's a dirty cummerbund.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's got like a little dried-out corsage.  I love when you see all those whores standing like through the sunroof going,  Yeah.  Woo!  Woo!  I always want to see them, like, rear-end the car in front of them, just... 
[00:40:00]  Chop them in half.  Because they're always trying to come off like that's actually their car.  Right.  Woo!  Because that's how, like, Bill Gates and them act when they're in a limo.  When they're going to a big meeting somewhere.  Hanging out the sunroof of his limo.  Oh, yes.  So, you know the guy has a flask in the front seat in between, you know, jobs.  I drive people everywhere.  But, hey, they're treating us right. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  They're treating us right.  They ordered the limo to make us feel good as we go over to A&E.  Yeah, we get in.  So we get in, seven or eight of us, in a limousine that fits maybe three people comfortably.  Oh, it's not a super stretch.  No, it's a stretch.  Where you can actually fit seven people.  It's a stretch Dodge Omni.  Ford Taurus.  It was two seats facing each other.  Right.  Which is that type of limo that is the smallest kind of limo.  Our knees were pretty much... 
[00:41:00]  It's good for four people, that type of limo.  If you've got four people and want a limo, that's the one you get.  And there is, I think, seven people.  Seven people.  Yeah, I was across from Anthony.  Our knees were touching.  And then I'm like, oh, Jesus.  And I pull the door closed, you know, and the handle falls off.  The handle comes off in Ovi's hand.  I'm like...  I think I took this limo.  I'm like, holy shit.  It was so funny.  We just looked at each other like, okay, this is great.  Dirty butterscotch interior. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  The whole way over, the guy's getting pumped because it's showtime.  And he's like, are you guys pumped?  Are you guys ready?  And I'm like, we're just playing this out at this point to get a good...  You know, Telly Savalas used to use this limo when he used to go over to the set on Kojak.  Right.  It's a Delta 88 stretch.  We're on two levels at this point.  This guy's getting pumped for the meeting.  And Anthony and I are just going through it because we know it'll make for good radio today.  That's all.  At this point, I know this is going to just be a disaster. 
[00:42:00]  And we are headed over to A&E.  A&E.  I am what they call...  I am an optimist.  I am not a bridge burner by no means.  I like playing things out to see where they're going to go.  And if you're going to make some relationships in this business that we call show, Opie, I like to do it with a smile and good spirits.  You're professional.  So when we meet people at A&E or telepictures or anything, regardless of who is taking us there or the mood we're in, they will get a smile, a greeting, and some humorous anecdotes from this person. 
[00:42:30]  They call me the optimist.  I'm the optimist.  Hey, beaner.  And A&E doing some fine things on TV lately.  So we did the security thing already earlier.  And we go upstairs.  We go upstairs, and we meet the people that we have to now pitch this horse shit to.  And again, as always, they're always very nice, very cordial, nice people that you meet at these things. 
[00:43:00]  I believe it was Nancy, right?  Yeah.  Rob?  Yeah.  And a guy named Michael.  Michael.  Michael from telepictures.  Michael was working at telepictures during our meetings over there.  Who is a huge fan of the Opie and Anthony program.  Great guy.  He's a huge fan of the show.  He understands us, what we do.  He was the one that dragged us into telepictures for a bunch of meetings as they tried to figure out a TV show for us.  He has since left telepictures about a year ago, now works for A&E. 
[00:43:30]  That's the reason we were meeting with A&E, not because of this idea.  Not because of the idea or the guy.  Because we couldn't figure out why, because something didn't match up.  It was Michael who heard about this pitch that had Opie and Anthony as a host.  And he goes, Opie and Anthony, holy crap, you know, these guys are really talented.  And we've been trying to figure out something for them for years at telepictures.  We should at least meet with them.  Yeah, at least meet with them.  So we walk into that huge generic conference room thing.  Do they have like those precinct desks that are made out of nothing but metal? 
[00:44:00]  No, this is always the conference room.  It was the big wooden table with those little conference call things in the middle and a lot of chairs.  The little screen up on the wall for the PowerPoint presentation things.  And your basic conference room, glass wall out to the hallway so you make sure no shenanigans are happening there if you're the brass.  And we sit down and the first thing I notice is the woman, Nancy, she's in charge. 
[00:44:30]  She's the one running this show.  She's the one you've got to impress.  She's the one that has to be impressed.  And she's sitting there and the first little inkling I got that there was a problem was the fact that she looked at one of the other guys,  I'm not sure which one, and said, well, I haven't read anything or heard anything about this.  Rob hasn't told me anything about the pitch yet, which led me to believe. 
[00:45:00]  I was thinking to myself now, if Rob was excited about this, wouldn't he have gone to the one that was really in charge and said,  we're meeting with these people today.  Here's what they're pitching.  Here's the show.  It's a great idea.  Blah, blah, blah.  She went into this ice cold, had no inkling what this show was going to be about.  And I gulped, Anthony gulped, and, you know, the production company we were with there,  who claimed that we were so close to a TV deal, it wasn't even funny, they pretty much just had to meet us.  But the head woman there didn't have a clue what this was about. 
[00:45:30]  So now the pitch starts.  And all we needed was Opie's instant replay because he has the cricket ones on him.  That is exactly what happened.  He goes with the pitch.  The main guy on our side.  And there's the pitch.  It was kind of like that Seinfeld-George thing.  I absolutely felt like I was in that fucking episode of Seinfeld.  They sit down in front of the NBC. 
[00:46:00]  And George, all proud, goes, it's a show about nothing.  And the guy running the network is like, what, nothing?  It's got to be about something.  And George just sits back all confident.  Nope.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  And Jerry's all nervous.  He's like, no, no, it's about something.  It's like, no, no, it's not.  It's a show about nothing. 
[00:46:30]  And everyone's just flabbergasted in the room and cannot believe that these words are coming out of this guy's mouth.  And I was sitting right there in the middle of it.  We lived it.  So this guy, he goes, all right, the show, it's Opie and Anthony hosting a show.  It's Mythbusters meets Jackass.  There's the big pitch.  Dead silence.  And Nancy goes, ah, I wouldn't use the word jackass whatsoever. 
[00:47:00]  You know how many lawsuits are pending because of that show?  Yeah, that's probably not a good selling point.  So she's taking the legs out from underneath one of her own guys?  No, this is the guy that we were with, the production guy.  Oh, I get it.  No, he's now finally pitching A&E.  You know, the A&E, those three guys are sitting at the head of the table.  Yeah.  So he's like, yeah, it's Mythbusters meets Jackass.  And she's like, I wouldn't use the word jackass whatsoever.  There's so many lawsuits pending.  That show has been a complete disaster.  Yeah.  And we have two shows. 
[00:47:30]  And the A&E people are like, we have two shows that are all done, ready to air, that we can't air.  Because of lawsuits, because there's too many similarities with the jackass concept.  And our show is a very dangerous version of Mythbusters, let's be honest here.  You know, he's talking about, like, you know, taking a car, you know, going 55 miles an hour and then slamming it into reverse to see what happens.  You know, all sorts of stuff that...  I didn't know there were myths about that.  Isn't it more like...  Stuff like that where kids would probably try to do this at home. 
[00:48:00]  So now we have no pitch whatsoever.  Our whole pitch has been destroyed.  Less than 30 seconds into it.  She had just wiped it out.  She took a huge sword and just hacked his legs off.  And he fell down.  And we are sitting there.  Nothing to say.  Hold on.  He didn't fall down then.  The bozo is not getting it at this point.  He's not getting it.  He goes, but Jackass was the hottest show on TV and it made a movie.  Ixnay on the act, J.S.  Yay.  He goes, I'm 47. 
[00:48:30]  I still rent the movie with my friends and still laugh.  It just continues to make...  He's like this with his hands.  Continues to make money.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's still going.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's still going.  Me and Opio is sitting there.  And they're occasionally glancing over at the two of you like you actually...  Oh, yeah.  Well, that...  We got the glance through the whole thing.  And the most horrific glance I got was when she goes, all right.  So, now they're just playing it out because we can't leave after a minute.  Right.  That's embarrassing for everybody. 
[00:49:00]  And unlike us, they're polite and nice.  Yeah.  Like, when we're in these situations with our radio show, we're like, well, you get the  fuck out of here.  Just leave.  You have no business being in here.  We have no business being in that room.  But they're nice people.  So, they're like going to at least play with us a little bit.  So, after a minute, she's playing out the idea.  She goes, okay.  So, you got this thing.  Blah, blah, blah.  She goes, so, after this stunt, whatever it is, happens, how does it end?  What is in the wrap-up?  Because, like, Mythbusters, you know, you got a... 
[00:49:30]  Is the myth true?  Or false?  Is it false?  Is it plausible?  They run through their results.  That's how it works.  On this one, so, how does it end?  So, she looks over at the guy that's pitching.  He doesn't say anything because there is no ending.  Then, she looks over at me.  I was instantly back in English class.  I heat it up, man.  The teacher just asked me a question I don't know the answer to. 
[00:50:00]  And I sit looking.  I'm looking like, please don't pick me.  Please don't pick me.  Please don't...  I don't know how it ends.  I can't even fake how it ends.  I can't come up with an ending.  I don't know.  So, the guy, you know, from the TV production company, he has to come up with something.  So, he's like, that's the beauty of it.  Nothing gets accomplished at the end.  It's a show about nothing.  It doesn't end.  There's no show.  Before you know it, the credit rolls.  There's no conclusion. 
[00:50:30]  And he's looking at it at night, because now he's trying to bail himself out.  He's like, those guys will just do what they do back.  Do what they do.  It's how they interact with the stunt.  We do what we do.  And then she obviously goes, this is basically Mythbusters is what you're freaking...  We do what we do.  Sit, Ubu, sit.  Right.  Hey, on to the next show.  And then she goes, all right, let's go with this further.  Meow.  Because she's...  Shh.  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  Do-do.  Do-do.  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do.  Do-do-do. 
[00:51:00]  But now I think she's just playing with the guy, like a little cat with a wounded mouse.  So she has a better story to tell at the Christmas party.  Because she goes, okay, what do we put on the side of a bus?  You know, because we have to promote this new show with Opie and Anthony.  She even said, she goes, I don't want to be cliche about this, you know, but what's  the side of the bus?  What do we put on the side of the bus?  Which is, you know, how do you wrap it up into a bus board?  Right.  Into something that you would see drive by on the side of a bus and look at it and know 
[00:51:30]  what it's about.  And people would go, wow, I got to watch that show.  Got to watch it.  I just have your two heads and he goes, huh?  Huh?  This is it right here.  Come on, people.  Why weren't you at the pitch with us?  That's hilarious.  Of course.  Huh?  Both of us making that stupid face.  Says it all, Bill.  We needed Bill Burr there.  Here's Opie and Anthony.  You might as well just have fun at that point.  That's like when you're bombing in a day like, this girl's not going to do anything with 
[00:52:00]  you just start fucking staring at her tits.  But at this point, we are bombing so bad.  Honestly, we have nothing to do with it.  They're using us to try to get this horse shit made.  We were the eye candy.  Right.  But I'm sitting there because I remember like deja vu where we were in meetings like this  and we had no radio career.  And I was thinking we were back with no radio career.  And then I went, oh, wait a minute.  We're doing really well for XM Satellite Radio.  This doesn't mean shit in the end.  And so then I started really enjoying the interaction that was going on. 
[00:52:30]  At first, though, you're right.  It was a flashback.  It was a flashback.  Like, we're losers and we have nothing.  Be in one of these meetings when you don't have a job, when you're not doing radio on  a daily basis, when your future is not so bright.  You don't know what's going to happen.  Very up in the air.  You're sitting in these meetings going, wait, this is what my life is now?  Yeah.  But, oh, it's right.  It snapped in both of our heads.  It's like, wait a minute, I go to work every day.  We're all right now.  We've got great careers. 
[00:53:00]  XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, whew.  You know how bad it got for us?  We had to take a meeting with this production house before, like we've said many times during  this conversation.  We also had a, we took phone calls from an internet radio company.  And we took, and we actually took a meeting in the middle of nowhere in Jersey with a video  game company.  Dude, who was the internet guy?  He was a child star.  Which guy was he?  Oh, no, that was another thing.  The dude from Wonder Years.  The older brother.  The older brother.  From Wonder Years. 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  Our career was hinging on the older brother from the Wonder Years.  He's doing internet radio now.  Doing internet radio, calling our agent.  Yeah.  A big fan of our show.  So, the lady from A&E is like, you know, what's on the side of the bus?  And then she gives us a great example.  What's on the bus?  Right.  She goes, she goes, growing up Gotti.  Just, you know, sells the show.  Sells the show.  You got the graphic.  You got the little diamond pinky ring looking thing.  You got the Gotti name.  You know what you're getting. 
[00:54:00]  So, she goes, growing up Gotti.  What do you got for this show?  And so, this dude goes, what's on the box?  Yeah.  Well, what I see on the side of the box is he didn't even get the bus thing right.  It's Opie and Anthony, and then he mentions the name of the show, which means nothing.  And then she's like, guys, you know, this is Mythbusters.  It's being done like crazy all over TV.  And she's letting him down lightly.  But this guy is still close.  He's like, well, can we come back to you? 
[00:54:30]  We'll work on it.  We'll come at it from some different angles, and we'll rework it.  Now you're begging.  Now you're begging.  How many times I've said that?  Oh, no.  You've been there.  So, we're like, he's like, can we have another meeting?  And she, because she's the big boss, and she has the underlinks with her, she goes, yeah,  you could email Rob or Michael, and we'll see where it goes.  Just not me.  Just not me, because she's basically saying, I'm done with you guys unless a miracle happens.  Did you see the big charm bracelet she had on? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  She had this big charm bracelet on that was also a watch.  Yeah.  And I noticed very early on, I heard, clang, clang, as she turned her watch to look at  it.  Like, it was like wind chimes on her watch, where you couldn't miss, she was looking at  her watch.  So, you ever try to sneak a look at your watch and really not look like you're looking at  your watch?  Yeah.  And you do something like, oh, I got a splinter, or my fingernail, and you kind of can look.  Yeah.  Hers was, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang. 
[00:55:30]  Big charm bracelets, swinging.  Looking at her watch.  It was like, yeah.  That happened to me.  Last year, I was paired up with this writer who, I just totally misread him.  Like, his, like, his, a lot of writers are, like, totally, like, introverted.  So, when you go to meet, like, all their funny is on the page.  So, the fucking meetings are so awkward.  But this guy, he had, like, energy and shit, and I totally misread him.  He was a fucking psycho.  Oh, no.  And before we go in there, I'm like, okay, man, I'm the comedian, so, you know, you just  kind of kick me into bounds, and I'll pitch this thing.  And he said, oh, no. 
[00:56:00]  He goes, I'll handle it.  He goes, I am the pitch master.  I swear to God he said that.  This dude went in there, just grabs the reins, and starts pitching this fucking idea.  It was like a Tarantino movie.  It's like the end came first, then the beginning was in the middle, Travolta's, like, walking  by in the background, and people are just, like, two minutes into it, people are  they're, like, playing with their pens.  Oh, no.  I literally had to sit him down and just be like, dude, when fucking people are, like,  winding their watches and looking at something on their ankle, as you're pitching this allegedly 
[00:56:30]  million-dollar, oh, and he started off so big, this idea is going to change television.  Wow.  Where do you go from there?  Yeah.  That's like when they bring you up as a comedian, like, oh, this next guy.  Oh, you are in for a treat, everybody.  Hold on to your hats, because this fucking guy.  And you're just sitting there standing, like, dude, take it down.  Take it down.  I got nothing.  I got nothing that can follow that.  That's so true.  Yeah, but...  If this guy isn't the funniest fucking guy you've ever seen, you're like, oh. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  What people don't understand, you know, there's a lot of shit on TV.  There are so many other ideas that obviously never make it to TV.  Oh, yeah.  That's the reality show that one of these networks should make.  Yeah, shit.  Is a whole show on these pitch meetings, because it's so ridiculous.  So, anyway...  Your dream of the pitch meeting, by the way, is to go in, sit down in front of these people,  pitch your show, and have them just howling.  Have these jaded network people howling at your shit, just sweating because they're laughing, 
[00:57:30]  enjoying it, shaking your hand, going, you come in tomorrow, and we'll green light this  thing, and to sit there and have them looking like dogs when you whistle at them, and they  tilt their head and their ears go up, they're just staring at you, is horrific.  So, we're almost done.  So, then...  Someone said we should have broken out the aristocrats act.  Yeah.  Ta-da!  Ta-da!  So, let's move on, because I'm fucking Opie, and then... 
[00:58:00]  We've got to hurry up the story, because Richard Cheese is here with his band.  They've got to play a few numbers before they get out of here.  But, so he's like, well, can we rework this and, you know, represent it to you?  And she's being nice, like, yeah, you can email Rob or whatever.  And she says, you know, a couple weeks or whatever, maybe we could, you know, see where  you're at.  Yeah.  And he goes, a couple weeks?  I was hoping 6.30.  Yeah, she goes, yeah, when, it was actually before she said a couple of weeks. 
[00:58:30]  She goes, yeah, at some point, at some point...  At some point.  We'll get back together and, you know, if you can rework this and rehash it.  And he goes, yeah, how about 6.30?  Not showing how desperate he is at all.  Oh, uh-huh.  Get it, like, right away.  That's funny.  It's like, well, you know, a couple of weeks or...  Because then he's like...  Never.  You know, I bet you if we all just went to Happy Hour and had a few beers, you'd see it  my way.  Yeah, yeah.  He's getting nothing, dude.  Let's bring in alcohol.  Nothing.  Let's bring some alcohol into this and... 
[00:59:00]  So...  Bees of sweat pouring down his...  Did he have flop sweat?  I couldn't look at anybody.  Anthony said that he was holding back flop sweat.  I was looking at my water.  I was looking at my bottle of water.  My bottle of conference room table water.  Did you hear me openly just start laughing a few times?  Oh, yeah.  Because I was uncomfortable and it was getting the best of me.  I do the same thing on the radio show.  I just started laughing at nothing funny because I was just so uncomfortable, right? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  So then the meeting is finally officially over.  And the reason we knew it was over was they changed the subject and Nancy goes, so is it  still nice outside?  Oh, boy.  She is now having a conversation with me that I have with my grandma.  You know when you've pitched a great idea that you'll start talking about the weather.  Yeah.  And not the idea right until you're out of the building.  Because I picture when Seinfeld was pitched and all these other great shows, everybody loves  Raymond.  I bet you they're talking right up to the elevator. 
[01:00:00]  So, anyway, we'll get back together, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Instead, we're getting...  So, is it still nice outside?  We want first shot at this.  They do that show.  Don't talk to anybody else.  You're not going anywhere else.  Yeah.  And they follow you all the way down, you know, making sure that everyone's on the same page  as you leave the building.  They gave us directions to Spike TV.  Right.  So, we get the, so is it nice outside conversation.  Like, oh, my God, we're talking about the weather.  Yeah.  So, we're now in the elevator. 
[01:00:30]  They're gone.  We said goodbye.  And Michael from Telepictures, who's the guy that really gets us in our show, was cool.  And he goes, we'll keep in touch.  We'll keep in touch.  So, then, we're in the elevator, and this clown that we were with the whole time, he  goes, should we say what he said about it?  Oh, my God.  Let's just say the woman that was in charge over there.  Yeah.  That he pitched this to, and she wasn't very, I don't know, she didn't find it very interesting. 
[01:01:00]  He had some very derogatory remarks for her when we're in the elevator alone.  And he goes, did anyone else feel what I was feeling?  She's a real.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  She's a real C.  But then he goes.  Oh, my God.  That's like the awful comedian just blaming the crowd.  Right.  You guys fucking suck.  You know.  No, you do.  And so, Ann and I are looking at each other.  Everyone, everyone in the elevator knows it's so done. 
[01:01:30]  This thing is done.  It just.  Whip it.  You can't.  Throw it through the shredder.  This ain't happening.  You cannot have misinterpreted that meeting.  You can't have thought it went well.  The elevator is moving like half a mile an hour.  It's like everyone just got raped, and you can't look at each other.  You're so ashamed.  Dude, so we're in the elevator, and it's so done, and the guy's like, he's so delusional.  He's like, did you guys feel it?  We are so close.  We're so close. 
[01:02:00]  We'll just get back to our office.  We're going to rework this thing.  And you and I and Ann will all be in touch with emails, and we'll get back together real soon.  We are so close.  You guys can feel it, right?  And we're like, yeah, we can feel it.  The second he left you guys, he burst into tears.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  No, he's.  We're on the sidewalk, and he goes, yeah, I think this needs a little tweaking.  A little tweaking.  A little tweaking.  But we'll get back to them after tweaking.  Tweaking.  This thing needs a machete to the jugular. 
[01:02:30]  That's like, you know, no, I think we'll all be fine.  It just needs a little tweaking.  Please, please, please get to your, please get to your life.  It would have been so funny, people.  Let me tell you how funny the bit I just was going to do would have been.  It would have been like, please get to your lifeboats, people, as the Titanic is sinking,  and he's saying everything's fine.  Like the pitch meeting, like that, but only, and coming out of this would have been really  funny.  But this does. 
[01:03:00]  All right, get some batteries for it.  I need a new bullhorn.  I need a new bullhorn.  It didn't need batteries because the red light was on.  There had been a constant problem with the volume knob.  I always wondered what it looked like when Carrot Top bombs.  Pulls out a prop that just doesn't work. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  Just smash it.  So.  Pulls out the toilet seat with the toupee on it.  And it falls, the toupee falls up.  Well, there goes that joke.  You know, you think when you work a big casino.  Yes, Hawk, I need a new bullhorn.  That one broke.  I'm sure there's a toy store that's open at this hour.  That one, I need a new bullhorn.  You came in with the batteries. 
[01:04:00]  Too late.  A little too late on the battery.  It wasn't batteries.  The red power light was on.  Everything, it was broken.  Somebody broke it.  How many of those got busted in New Orleans?  Get into the super dark.  So, we're on the sidewalk.  And he's delusional.  He thinks it still has a shot.  And we're like, yeah, yeah.  Yes, yes.  Like, yeah, yeah.  And they walk off excitedly.  And Ant and I are standing on the sidewalk.  And that's when we realized that there's no limo to take us back. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, it was a one-way limo trip.  And we were on the other side of Manhattan.  Completely across town.  It wasn't like, you know, the limo actually served a purpose.  It was a ride.  That's probably because the driver had a live feed of the pitch meeting.  It's just like, you know what?  This shit is going nowhere.  I'm out of here.  It just shows you what this production company is all about.  He hired a cheesy limo company to take us one way. 
[01:05:00]  So, then Ant and I are just laughing the whole way back to this area.  Now, we're walking back how many blocks?  We walked 30 blocks.  30 blocks.  We walked 30 blocks.  But the whole way.  Because it was rush hour, too.  We don't want to jump in a cab and all that.  The whole way, though.  We are fucking laughing our balls off.  We're like, it's Mythbusters with lawsuits.  With lawsuits.  It's a great pitch.  Oh.  So, that was the big pitch for yesterday.  A new thing we're going to attempt to do on this show is take you a little more inside 
[01:05:30]  with the show.  This is an actual email that I wrote to our agent this morning.  I got an email from Nancy over at A&E, by the way.  It just said, good luck, bro.  This is what I wrote to my...  This is what I wrote to our agent this morning at 5.30 in the morning.  Yeah, I woke up in the hotel and I checked my emails. 
[01:06:00]  Just one email from Opie.  I opened it and I got my first chuckle of the day.  Thank you, Opie.  Because I'm not...  Because, you know, we're not bullshit.  We're not fooling around anymore.  We're just not.  At this point in our careers, we're not going through this bullshit anymore.  So, I write, I hear that Spike TV called yesterday.  When you talk to them today, do not pull...  Said production company.  The name of the production company that we were with yesterday at A&E into this discussion  with Spike TV. 
[01:06:30]  Anthony and I have no confidence that these guys can pull off a show.  So, I'm sure Ross, who's our agent's brother, because he was at the meeting, has filled  you in on the disastrous meeting we had.  At this stage of our careers, we shouldn't have to be involved with lower level production  companies.  Production company that we were with yesterday, I don't want to give their name out, needs  us so much more than we need them.  The only reason A&E took the meeting is because Michael from Telepictures now works there. 
[01:07:00]  We were completely embarrassed yesterday.  End of story.  Larry from Jersey goes, was the limo driven by a monkey?  That would have made a great TV show.  Imagine monkey limo driver.  I would pitch that.  That's hysterical.  You'd probably sell it.  Take me to 59th Street.  He's a fucking monkey.  And he drives a limo.  He's a monkey.  He drives a limo.  I'm pitching that one.  What?  That's a great show. 
[01:07:30]  What a great day.  It was a great day, by the way.  Yeah, but you know what?  You guys laugh.  It was a great day.  Side to the bus.  It was a great day.  Come on.  It's a no brainer.  When you guys walking up the street laughing, that's what gets you through those pitch meetings.  I've been out in L.A. pitching with somebody else.  And as you're bombing, and you almost, after like the third meeting you go into that you're  bombing, you almost know what the hell you're going to be laughing at when you leave.  So you almost start laughing in the middle of it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  But everybody's been there.  We were actually talking about how horrible those were when you first did them. 
[01:08:00]  Like, and you'd walk out, and it was serious.  And you're like, oh, God, that didn't go well, did it?  And you're kind of glad when you've been in it a few years, and you know that, oh, my  God, that stunk on ice, and you can laugh about it.  It's not just like, oh, my God.  My whole life just crumbled in there.  I bombed at CBS one time.  I swear to God.  It was like a 10-minute pitch.  I was bombing so bad, I blew through it in like a minute and a half. 
[01:08:30]  My mouth was all dry.  And then I'm just sitting there, and they're just staring at me.  Oh, I started doing jokes for my act from like 92, you know?  What's up with this crisscross, huh?  These guys are crazy.  And they were just like, all right, buddy.  It's got to be sunny out today, huh?  Hey, get it warm.  Take it easy.  Fuck.  It's hilarious, man.  It is just hilarious.  There you have it.  That was our day yesterday.  I hope it was entertaining for you folks out there in Radioland. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Why is Anthony staying at a hotel?  Because I don't want to drive back to Long Island after one of those meetings in rush hour traffic, my friend.  I'm a fancy man.  I don't sit in traffic on the Long Island Expressway.  Take that.  He wants to cry and wear room service.  No, he wants to go to the fucking message board.  Anthony's in a hotel.  Oh, we get thrown out.  What happened?  The moths took over. 
[01:09:30]  They were sleeping in my bed.  I had to leave.  There you go.  Richard Cheese.  Good evening, fellas.  There he is, Dick Cheese.  How you doing?  Good.  How's that piano sound?  Can you hear that okay?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Right off the bat.  Yeah, baby.  What happened to the other guy?  Well, you know, the bass player got laid last night, so he ain't here.  And the drummer, we might need to call him this morning because he's a flake.  You go through a lot of band members.  Well, yeah, that's true.  But you know what?  You are like the titular head. 
[01:10:00]  And then you have these...  That's my nickname, by the way.  Titular head.  Richard the titular head.  Cheese.  It's like Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.  Every time he comes out, it's a whole new lineup.  That's right.  A whole new band around him, but all you need is the guy.  Yeah.  Well, actually, I keep my piano player, Bobby Ricotta.  Can we hear him okay?  But he isn't your original piano player.  Well, I mean, he's the...  You are the guy that took off and started playing piano for that broad.  What's her name?  What broad was that?  Alanis Morissette.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  For Hilary Duff.  Hilary Duff.  Yeah, he didn't count.  But I've had Bobby here for a long time, so he's working. 
[01:10:30]  In the tens of days.  But, guys, thanks for having us back on.  No problem.  You're a team.  We have nothing to promote, which is the best, because it just shows you that we're here for you.  For the love.  For the love.  And I'm so glad you brought chicks in this time.  There's so many more women here.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  There aren't any again.  Yeah, there's...  You keep missing the boat as far as the women.  Do you know we had three girls in here about a week, two weeks ago, was it?  I'm not even sure.  They went up on the console, took that wiffle ball bat, and just abused themselves with it. 
[01:11:00]  Really?  Vaginally.  Yeah.  Oh, excellent.  That happened right here in our studios, and you missed that one.  And we missed it.  Incidentally, we took some wiffle ball bats ourselves at A&E.  Yes, at A&E.  Now, was that yesterday you did that?  That was indeed yesterday.  Oh, man.  That was fresh on mine.  We get a lot of Richard Cheese people saying, oh, Richard Cheese, you've got to do a TV show.  And I'll say, all right, well, you go ahead and get me the people who want to do it, who work at the network.  I don't need to go pitch them.  I'm not going anywhere near that. 
[01:11:30]  Because they're all about saying no.  Because they keep their job if they say no.  If they never spend any money in the development budget, and they never give anyone a show, they keep their job.  They have shows that are running.  It's not like there's dead air.  Exactly.  So why develop anything new?  Do something new that might rock the boat and get them thrown out.  I had a pitch meeting with VH1 last time I was in New York in June.  And this guy, he's been a Richard Cheese fan.  He calls me in.  He sits me down in a nice little office.  He's like, so, we'd like to do a show.  And I'm like, great. 
[01:12:00]  What show did you want to do with Richard Cheese?  I don't know.  What did you want to do?  And I go, I don't know.  You've got the cameras.  What do you normally put in front of them?  You know, pick something.  We'll do whatever you want.  That is exactly what happens with us.  People say, we want Opie and Anthony for a show.  Okay, what's the idea?  We don't really.  We just, you guys do the thing.  This makes me feel so good because I always had meetings.  I didn't even understand what a meeting was when I first got into the business.  Be like, yeah, you know, you killed an Aspen.  Somebody at Merrimax wants to meet with you. 
[01:12:30]  And I didn't know I had to pitch ideas.  So I just come in there.  And, Bill, yeah, we saw you at Maspen.  You were really funny.  I'd be like, thanks.  No, what do you see for yourself?  What do you see yourself doing?  I don't know.  I thought that's what I was here for.  I liked Sanford and Son when I was growing up.  Oh, I liked it, too.  Remember the one where Lamont fell down the stairs?  All right, Bill.  Nice meeting with you.  And that would just be the end of it.  And I'd walk out like, what the fuck was that?  What happened?  I had an idea for you guys.  How about something like Mythbusters meets Jackass? 
[01:13:00]  Have you thought of this?  Wow.  See, now, why can't we get that pitched?  But with more lawsuits.  More, even more lawsuits.  I can see it on the side of the box.  That was the best point of the meeting when I realized, holy shit, he's pitching Mythbusters  to A&E.  How did you guys, I mean, I'm not...  I see Sesame Street meets Jackass.  Children doing the stunts that normally drunk and drugged out adults would do.  How did this guy get the green light to pitch a show for you without your approval?  I believe it was Bob saying, guys, go to our agent. 
[01:13:30]  So we knew about this.  We approved of it because our agent...  I might have to start repping you guys.  Said, hey, go.  And another thing, the truth of the matter is, I wanted to meet the people in charge over  there at A&E.  At this point, I think our agent has to stick to radio.  Doesn't A&E do mostly mystery shows and, you know, drama shows?  I mean, couldn't you guys get, like, a detective team going? 
[01:14:00]  We are doing...  We are going to be the new Angela Lansbury and Clareau.  What is that?  And we're going to solve crimes as we drive cars into pools.  It's going to be a wonderful show.  It's Mythbusters meets Columbo.  The Hardy Boys.  The Hardy Boys.  By the way, Untitled Donnie Most Project is one of my favorite shows.  Yeah.  I love that.  That was funny, right?  That was really funny.  You guys are funny.  Donnie Most.  We're funny, right?  Yeah, you are funny.  Let me just tell you, and we'll do a song for you. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, good.  And thanks for having us in.  There's a free keyboard, by the way.  Who are we supposed to thank for the keyboard, Ben?  Someplace called NOLA.  Is that right in the building?  Studio upstairs.  Studio upstairs.  Thanks for letting us use a keyboard.  And, you know, we've gotten so many Opie and Anthony listeners buying our CDs, and it's  you guys, and I love you guys, and I'd like to dedicate this song to you guys.  Hit it, Bobby.  Yeah.  Bobby Ricotta on the piano, everybody.  Love it.  This is for all the fabulous ladies listening in the audience.  This is also for Kobe Bryant. 
[01:15:00]  Rape me.  Rape me again.  Come on.  Rape me.  Rape me again.  I'm not the only one.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not the only one.  Let's go to the Brooklyn Bridge.  My favorite inside source.  I'll kiss your open source.  Thank you.

A lot of energy to start off the set.  It certainly is.  Well, we go in with the biggest number we've got, then it's all downhill from here.  Wonderful.  Thanks for having us back.  And we, you know, we did Shit Dick on your show.  Oh, everyone still commenting about. 
[01:16:30]  I don't think Bill Burr has heard Shit Dick.  I want to play Shit Dick.  I don't think I want to.  Oh, you'll love Shit Dick.  You have to play him the original.  Yeah, yeah.  We've got to play the original first.  But, you know, I'll tell you what.  We've had so many fans email us and say, when are you going to release that on the new CD?  Have you heard of Shit Dick?  Shit Dick by him.  You know what?  I haven't.  I haven't.  Is that the name of the band, the original band?  My life to continue.  Do you have time to, you know what?  I'm a little busy.  I don't think I have time for Shit Dick.  Oh, it's a great song.  Do you want to hear the original?  Okay, I thought it was another creep with bad breath was going to come in here. 
[01:17:00]  Do you want to hear the original first?  Yeah, well, sure.  This is, what's the name of the band?  Panzerfaust, right?  That's the record company.  Oh, the record company.  People Haters.  This is People Haters and Shit Dick on the home of rock and roll.  Shit Dick!  We hate all shit dick!  Andy Warhol. 
[01:17:30]  Shit Dick!  Mick Jagger.  Shit Dick!  Michael Jackson.  Shit Dick!  Jeffrey Dahmer.  Cannonball.  Shit Dick!  We hate shit dick!  But Slammin' Shit Dick!  Boy George Shit Dick!  Freddie Mercury. 
[01:18:00]  Shit Dick!  David Foley.  Shit Dick!  Rob Halpert-Judis.  We're shit dick!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Shit Dick!  Shit Dick!  Rock Hudson.  Shit Dick!  Liberace.  Shit Dick!  Damn neighbor.  Shit Dick!  Robert Englund.  Freddy Krueger. 
[01:18:30]  Fifth fucking shit dick!  Truman Capote.  Shit Dick!  Witcher Tim and...  Shit Dick!  Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart.  Shit Dick!  Richard Gere.  Bud Gerbilan.  Shit Dick!  We hate the fuck you shit dick! 
[01:19:00]  For fuck you shit dick!  You're sick!  Sick!  Sick!  Roy!  Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart.  Rod Stewart.  We'd like to do a special version of the song.  Last time we played it in a kind of a medium swing tempo.  This time we're going to take it down and make it a little ballad if you know what I'm saying.  A ballad.  I'm gonna do a ballad.  Thank you.  We hate all shit dicks, Andy Warhol, shit dick, Mick Jagger, shit dick, Michael Jackson, 
[01:19:30]  shit dick, Rock Hudson, shit dick, Liberace, shit dick, Jim Neighbors, shit dick, we hate 
[01:20:00]  the fucking shit dick, thank you very much.  Wow, I just, isn't that lovely?  I'm welling up over here, I was a little teary-eyed. 
[01:20:30]  Next time we're going to do it in a Calypso style, I'm so excited.  Calypso, wow.  But that song has been such a popular song, we played that at the Bowery after we were  on your show.  Wow.  We played it at the Bowery, people hollered it out and requested it.  And so we're just so lucky, and thank you for introducing us to that wonderful number.  No problem.  Well, when we could introduce, music is love, and that song especially, just if we could  share it through you.  Can I get you a drink?  Because that was beautiful, man.  I like how when he was going to wrap up the song, the signal was he waved goodbye. 
[01:21:00]  Well, that's a signal.  You know what that is?  That's technical music showbiz stuff.  And I don't want to, you know, you and the comedy have your techniques, your microphones  and your brick walls.  But we have our own, the language that we speak, that Bobby and I speak.  The lingo.  And, you know, I also, last time we were on the show, we talked a little bit about Paul  Anka.  Right.  I wanted to know if you've spoken with him.  Well, he put out a CD that rips off our CDs.  You know, we do our loungy, swinging versions of the Pop Rocket songs. 
[01:21:30]  He calls himself the Punisher right here, Paul Anka.  He calls himself the yelling at his band on a secret bootleg tape.  And you remember that tape you played us.  Well, I did a lot of research, and there is a website on the internet where you can download  the entire Paul Anka rant.  It's at noisetank.com.  And ironically, something I didn't really know had happened, and I'm sort of, this is a,  I'm debuting this on your show.  I think that's what the CD is that I just gave you.  Can you play a clip of this?  This is actually a recording someone made of me yelling at my band. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, no.  A few years ago, backstage, it was a rough show.  Some of the guys in the band did not dress properly for the performance.  Gotta hate that, right.  Can you, I don't usually...  So this is very similar to what happened with the Paul Anka thing.  Yeah, because we have a lot of new listeners.  We got a bootleg tape of Paul Anka screaming, yelling at his band about shirts and things.  Yeah.  The way they play.  They weren't playing up to par.  Yeah, and I guess someone caught me doing this, one of the Richard Cheese shows.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  Some of the old bands.  I think that's what's on this CD.  Let's see what's on there. 
[01:22:30]  It's a poor quality recording.  Someone made it.  First order of business.  No t-shirts on stage.  You understand that?  I gave you a list.  That half a list I gave you with cues and everything else on it, okay?  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get shirts.  Do you understand?  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link.  The guys get shirts. 
[01:23:00]  Do you understand that?  This is like football, baseball, like anything else.  The guys get shirts.  That's just the fucking way it is.  Yeah, it goes on for quite some time.  What's it going to be, guys?  There is a lot of loose shit going on, and I'm telling you, you guys are on thin ice,  all right?  Is this...  I'm telling you right now...  Did this happen before the Paul Anka thing?  I don't know if Paul Anka wants to admit it, but he stole his rants from me. 
[01:23:30]  Because, you know, he stole my act from me, and then he stole his rants.  But this is the exact rant.  I know.  He took word for word everything that I said when I yelled at my band back then.  And he yelled at his band the exact same way.  Are you trying to say he had a script of your rant?  He transcribed my rant when he ranted at his band.  Wow.  That guy does not have an original bone in his body.  No, obviously.  And I also heard he's telling people he wrote the Tonight Show theme, which Bobby Ricotta wrote. 
[01:24:00]  That was Bobby Ricotta's song.  Bobby Ricotta wrote that.  Guys, a very popular song.  Paul Anka ripped that off from Bobby.  Wow.  Nice work.  Should we do another song and lighten things up for the kids?  Did you write something, I remember the moments of your existence?  A song like that?  Do I remember...  Do you remember the moments of your existence?  Kind of similar, but...  Have you seen the cover of the Barbra Streisand, Barry Gibbs...  Holy shit!  That is beauty and the beast, if I've ever seen them. 
[01:24:30]  We haven't talked about that yet.  Wow.  Those two are getting together for the second time, and he looks completely out of it.  He is.  Like he should be...  Puffed up.  ...committed or something.  He had some inflation...  He had some collagen implants, but in the wrong places on his head.  Some kind of work was done.  It looked like a dusting of cotton candy was placed on his head.  Like, remember, he used to have...  In the Bee Gees, he had that huge head of 70s hair.  Yeah, yeah.  And the big beard and mustache. 
[01:25:00]  Now, his beard and mustache is scraggly like an old sick dog.  And the top of his head, I swear to you, it's like thinly placed cotton candy was laid over his head.  He looked like he had a stroke or something.  Yeah, something really bad happened there.  This is a little song I'd like to dedicate to Barry Gibbs and his face.  Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk.  I'm a woman's man.  No time to talk.  That's all I know of it. 
[01:25:30]  Thank you.  Wow.  Staying alive, everybody.  All right, there it is.  Spin that around.  Look at it.  Is there the picture?  What happened?  And where's the original?  She looks horrified.  Well, she's probably...  That's not even her.  That's probably her stunt double.  Where's the original album?  Yeah, that's what you should do.  Do a Google and get the original.  He looks like an out-of-work magician.  Because they're trying to do the original album cover, right?  Yeah, they recreated the original album.  Yeah.  It's so creepy. 
[01:26:00]  Well, Richard, we've been talking for like an hour and a half.  I've got to take a...  But we haven't taken a break yet.  Yeah.  Well, do you want us to play a song while you go to the bathroom,  or do you want to take a break break?  Ooh.  We've got all the time in the world.  We can fill.  How long is it going to take you to pee?  I mean, we're not going to do Stairway to Heaven,  but we'll do something close.  Can you do like an Agata De Vita?  Well, we can do something long.  Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner?  How about Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald?  Ah, that's a good one.  Six minutes and 28 seconds.  We know.  We know.  We played the whole thing here on our show one day. 
[01:26:30]  One of the best bits we've done...  Well, I didn't do shit.  It was Anthony.  Talking about how Anthony's best bit since coming to XM.  Just...  Jesus Christ.  Did he have to document every second of the void in the song in real time?  We pulled up the anchor and then we set sail,  but I had to turn around to refuel her.  All right, enough.  We get it.  Every single thing.  I was a little hungry and got some saltines down in the galley.  The cupboard was empty, so I went to Bob's room. 
[01:27:00]  He had some under his bed.  There you go.  We're only 20 minutes in and I can still see the beach.  There you go.  Not a storm fucking cloud in sight.  When I was a kid in school, the teachers were...  You know, they were like these new age teachers at the school I went to when I was a kid.  And they had us go through that song and bisect every line and go match it to the historical account of them.  And, you know, all the other classes and schools were like studying like the Carpenters and cool bands. 
[01:27:30]  And we were like, oh, no, Gordon Lightfoot.  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  What an important cruise that was, too.  Carrying rocks across the fucking lake.  It's not like, you know, it was the Titanic with people on it or...  Right.  And I always think of a record label when the label said, Gordon, we need another single.  What do you got that's six and a half minutes long about a boat?  It's 1976. 
[01:28:00]  We've got disco.  What is our answer to disco?  I have a song about five guys and a crew of 13.  A boat no one ever heard of.  No one really gave a flying fuck about.  That's how you totally tune out after about three minutes into it.  Oh, my God.  You can't even hear what you're saying.  Oh, that's...  You can tune in.  You can tune in.  You're just like, dude, whatever.  Just fucking end it.  Like four minutes in, they're still.  We're swabbing the dick and the sun's shining bright and no storm clouds yet. 
[01:28:30]  Nothing, nothing even.  No danger at all.  And he forgot his thermos.  His thermos.  All right, we'll play some checkers on the deck that day.  Airs.  What time are you guys...  Get to the sinking.  What time are you guys got to get out of here?  Bobby's got to catch a flight.  He's got to leave around nine, but I'll stay as long as you think I'm funny.  Nice.  That is like 901.  But if you want me to do a song...  What is that you're playing right now?  Yeah, I'll tell you that.  What is it, the bed?  You just make that shit up?  Like the lead singer's talking? 
[01:29:00]  You don't have a name for that?  The bed.  The fill.  The bed.  Bobby is amazing.  So do you want to leave the room, or do you want us to take a full break?  Because we'll take a break with you, man.  Well, you can play us the break, and then Derek will give us a longer break.  Let's do a little radio head.  It's Richard Cheese.  What's the website there, Richard?  Oh, it's iloverechardcheese.com, and our new CD, Apertise for Destruction, is on sale  now.  And thank you guys so much for having us back.  And that's all we got.  And I got shirts for...  Oh, there's so much to talk about.  Very soothing tones. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  One, two.  Okay, computer.  Swing and song by my good friend, Radiohead.  When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye.  You're just like an angel.  Your skin makes me cry.  You float like a feather in a beautiful world.  I wish I was special.  You're so fucking special. 
[01:30:00]  Weirdo, but I'm a creep.  I'm a weirdo.  What the hell am I doing here?  I don't belong here.  On the O.P. and Anthony Show, on XM Satellite Radio, channel 202.  I don't belong here.  We'll be right back.  Thank you.  Richard Cheese, everyone.  Thanks, fellas.  When we get back, we got some great audio of Steve-O just really fucked up on... 
[01:30:30]  Was it Carson Daly?  Adam Parola.  Adam Parola.  The show that's on at like 2.30 in the morning, I guess, so no one really saw it, but we got  the audio.  And the video's up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com, but we'll talk about Steve-O  next.  Hey, this is Dane Cook.  Congrats to XM on 5 million subscribers.  What's up?  This is Chester from Lincoln Park, and congrats on XM.  You've got another million.  Hi, everybody.  This is Pat O'Brien, and congratulations to XM.  on 5 million. 
[01:31:00]  I can't find a bra that will holster my massive hooter.  I'm very proud of my big toe.  Thank God for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Shake your ass, show me what you're working with.  Shake your ass, watch yourself.  Shake your ass, show me what you're working with.  I said shake your ass.  I came here with my dick in my hand. 
[01:31:30]  Don't make me leave here with my foot in your ass.  Be cool, don't worry about how I'm ripping this shit when I'm flipping, kicking.  Nigga, that's just what I do.  Shake your ass, show me what you're working with.  Shake your ass.  Mystical, everybody.  Thank you.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Richard Cheese in studio.  The house band today.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Thank you.  On this fine Whip Em Out Wednesday, by the way, Anthony.  We haven't been able to talk about that, but WOW is in full effect. 
[01:32:00]  And I do believe that...  Is that what WOW stands for?  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I have not known that in the five years I've known you guys.  That is great.  We like to call it that old gag.  I did not know it.  Well, we're taking it to the next level.  Is the WOW line up and running there, Steve?  Yes, it is.  All right.  We have a WOW line now.  What is that number?  Are we promoting it when we go to break and all that?  Making the promo right now, actually.  Making the promo right now.  Okay.  That's good.  I thought maybe that would be done for Wednesday. 
[01:32:30]  But why would it be done for Wednesday?  Right.  So we'll give out that number somehow, some way?  Or not?  I think I know what it is.  I just don't want to say the wrong number, that's all.  All right.  So there was no reason for me to even bring up Whip Em Out Wednesday because...  There's no number.  I don't have new info for anybody.  There's no promo right now.  You have two days for a number?  And I don't have the number in front of me.  No WOW line?  There's a WOW line, yes.  But I don't know what that number is. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, what the number is?  I'm sure WOW is in it, right?  And the promo will be ready sometime today.  Grimone.  Wow, Mars coming to the plate.  WOW me what?  Zero five.  WOW me zero five.  WOW me oh five.  But not oh, because that would confuse people.  Is that enough numbers?  WOW me zero five.  Is there an area code there?  Yeah.  What?  Eight six six.  All right.  Eight what?  Eight six six WOW me oh five.  Eight six six WOW me oh five. 
[01:33:30]  And that would be zero five?  Zero five.  Okay.  WOW me zero five.  Eight six six WOW me zero five.  And people are supposed to call with their exciting, fascinating WOW stories on the road.  That's right.  Like what road you were on.  How it happened.  How hot the chick was.  What a pig she was.  It's kind of like, you know, we had the FU line and now we have the weather.  Now we have the WOW line.  The weather.  What it's a cross between. 
[01:34:00]  Your nickname that everyone gave you.  I was the skewerer for many years.  Her titties were like jackass meat.  So there you have it.  But WOW is very simple.  We have WOW stickers.  If you want an official Opie and Anthony WOW sticker, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City.  And we'll send out the WOW stickers immediately.  You throw the WOW in your car.  And there are ladies out there that will WOW you if they see the WOW stickers. 
[01:34:30]  It's been working like a charm for many years.  Why have we changed positions here?  Yeah.  Why is Bill Burr a lot closer to us here?  We had to move the Lounge Against the Machine piano speaker over to this microphone.  So now Bill's over there.  This will be the name of your next album.  Yeah.  Well, the first album was Lounge Against the Machine.  Ah.  And then the second one was Toxicity.  I'm never going to get caught up on the show.  No.  It's okay.  You don't have to know.  We're never on the show.  We're never in New York.  We wish we were.  You know this is the only reason why we stayed the extra two days on the trip?  We came in on Monday. 
[01:35:00]  We did a private party.  Thank you.  And then yesterday we did the triple.  We did Conan O'Brien show.  We saw the Conan show, which was great.  Wait, you saw it?  We went and saw the taping.  I'm not on it.  You're on it.  No, we're not that good.  And then we went and saw Spamalot.  Have you guys seen Spamalot yet?  No.  I have not seen the Spamalot.  I can't tell you.  It's pretty damn good.  Is it?  Even though you'd think it's a big old gay fruity musical, it's so fucking funny.  It's getting rave reviews.  It's unbelievably impressive.  And how did you get tickets?  We played a party for the lead actress in the show. 
[01:35:30]  She hired us to play her birthday party the other day, Sara Ramirez.  And she was very nice.  And paid you in tickets.  No, they paid us with money and drinks and tickets.  I'm telling you, it was the best gig we've had in a long time.  Yeah, that's a good gig.  Tim Curry was there.  Tim Curry was at the party?  He was in Spamalot and he was there.  And that was kind of cool.  And you guys decided to stay?  Well, we stayed for two extra days because you guys wanted us on and we would have the chance to be on your show.  You couldn't find any flights yesterday? 
[01:36:00]  No.  It was all sold out.  And a lot of the planes, the wheels are turned to the left.  You can't get the front landing gear down on half the planes now.  That pilot rocked, though, man.  He was great.  I heard Larry King on the coverage and he goes,  How come they're not foaming the runway?  Are they not foaming the runway for a certain reason?  That's my Larry King impression.  Foaming the runway.  Like it's the 40s. 
[01:36:30]  CNN, we talked about this.  It took me out of the whole event because they got an expert on there that said,  Ah, this is a piece of cake.  There will be no problems here.  And then I went back to Fox and they were still hinting that this thing might cartwheel down the runway.  And I'm like, that's the type of coverage I want.  Landing with the gear turned all the way to the right like that.  Piece of cake.  I want to see a plane take off with it all.  You know how fast you've got to spin in a circle to reach the speed you need to get that baby off the ground?  What if it was just turned slightly to the left? 
[01:37:00]  Then they're really fucked.  Yeah, because then you'd land.  And turn right off the runway.  Yeah, that was great.  Well, we'd like to do a special song for you.  That was actually the pitch for our show.  We were going to, me and Opie, get in a jet and turn the wheel slightly to the right.  Right.  And try to land it that way.  Right.  Opie and Anthony, it's like Mythbusters, only everyone dies.  Opie and Anthony, slightly to the right.  Slightly to the right.  That's on the bus.  Huh?  That's on the bus.  On the side of the bus.  Huh?  It's Mythbusters. 
[01:37:30]  It's Mythbusters.  Come on, people.  Airport 77.  Right.  All right, listen, Richard Cheese, before we get back to you and the band, you and just  one other guy, actually.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened to your band.  Yeah, what happened?  You've got to, you know, we enjoy the Richard Cheese.  No, the bass player got laid, and he said he ain't coming up early.  And then the drummer, he flaked out.  What can I say?  He lives in Astoria.  He couldn't get his ass out of bed.  Well, you know, it's early, but I've got to tell you, you know, your band is kind of  important.  The band is key, but, you know, it's pretty soon it's just going to be you and karaoke. 
[01:38:00]  It will be.  You're one guy away from just...  Well, I'll tell you, it's torn around with a karaoke machine.  One guy away.  Are these days you're going to go away?  I know, but you know what?  It all depends on how much you pay us to be on the show.  Let's see.  So you guys paid us.  I think it was zero, so you get two guys.  Shut up.  We're not paying Bill either.  Yeah.  Hey, Bill.  Oh, poor Bill.  Am I right?  I have, like, no self-esteem.  He's waking up and actually coming to a job every morning, and Opie just keeps going. 
[01:38:30]  Just so at some point I can be like, go to MySpace.  Yeah.  Come on there.  So he can plug a website.  He's also playing Sacramento next weekend.  Oh, is that what you're doing?  Where are you playing in Sacramento?  The Punchline.  We actually, I swear to God, we played there.  We played there about two years ago.  We had a Star Trek band open up.  It doesn't thrill me.  It's a nice little venue, and there's a hot little bartender there.  I don't know what his name is.  By the name of Chuck.  I'll be here all week.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  We've got to do the Steve-O thing, and then we'll get back to Richard Cheese and another 
[01:39:00]  guy.  And Bobby Recona.  Richard Cheese and friend.  All right.  Our pal.  You look like an extreme skateboarder.  Oh, yeah.  Got the little red.  I just figured I'd just kill whatever momentum we had in that moment.  Just fucking throw that out there.  All right, Steve-O.  I'm not getting paid.  Fuck you.  But if you get more hits at BillBurr.com, that's got to be worth something, no?  That's true. 
[01:39:30]  We're getting Bill some money, supposedly.  All right, Steve-O, a friend of the show, made a complete fool of himself on Adam Carolla's  TV show last night.  Yeah, Adam Carolla's got some kind of talk show.  Does Adam Carolla have like 18 shows on now?  I saw there's something on a totally different channel.  I don't know what channel it is, what stations, what nothing.  I don't know what time.  But I see him doing some home improvement show with a bunch of people that know nothing  about home improvement, which must have been a great pitch meeting there, too. 
[01:40:00]  He's got this talk show.  We've got to fix up houses, but we don't know how to do it.  Huh?  What do you think?  You know what?  Side of the bus?  I do a better Adam Carolla than that.  Are you ready?  Oh, let's hear.  Yeah.  That's all I got, but it's good.  Just that one syllable.  So anyway, Steve-O was on Adam Carolla, and it made page six, Anthony.  Page six, Opie.  For you young go-getters, the video is up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com if you 
[01:40:30]  want to jump the gun.  But here's the story from page six in the post this morning.  Bloody mess.  Jackass star Steve-O claims he can't remember any of his drunken antics on Monday nights  Too Late with Adam Carolla.  In an email to one of the show's producers, Steve-O says,  I just woke up with no recollection of taping Adam's show.  Wow.  I can't help being more proud of myself.  On the show, an extremely lubricated Steve-O came out swearing and spitting.  He tried to tackle Carolla, and he broke a glass coffee table by smashing it with his fist, 
[01:41:00]  sending blood from his cut legs spurting all over the stage.  That's Steve-O.  Yeah.  That's how it's reading in the post today on page six.  We've had him here on this show, and he just is usually drugged out or drunk.  We're kind of amazed that he's still alive, actually.  Yeah.  This is a guy that could really take...  Die.  Could really die. 
[01:41:30]  Could really take his drugs and alcohol.  You know, most people would have been found dead already.  We thought he was going to be dead a couple of years ago.  Yeah, we have video of him just sleeping next to the elevator, right?  Yeah.  In between his appearances on our show.  Coke, pills, booze.  This guy does it all.  He loves it.  What do I talk about on Adam Carolla?  Just do what you do, Steve.  Do what you do.  What I do is drugs, and then I'll attack Adam Carolla,  try to strangle him, and then put my foot through something and almost bleed to death. 
[01:42:00]  Would you guys like to hear the audio?  Yeah, of course.  Absolutely.  Here's the audio of Steve-O losing it.  What?  What?  Yeah, welcome back.  It's too late on Adam Carolla.  I like that, bitch.  Yeah.  Bitch.  Tonight, our studio guest is Malcolm McClure, the great author.  No, Steve-O.  Eh, eh, eh.  Steve-O in studio tonight.  I like that, bitch.  Yeah, that was Steve-O.  Yeah.  All right, Steve has had a couple of glasses of Chardonnay. 
[01:42:30]  And I want to tell you, bitch.  Steve, Steve, Steve, focus, baby.  Hey, hey, Steve.  Here's the thing.  All right.  We thought it'd be fun if you had a few drinks and then came out here and did a stunt.  I would love that.  All right.  We're going to do that.  We're going to reel it in just a little bit.  I would love that.  We're going to get our focus.  We're going to get our focus now.  We're going to focus on a couple of questions.  Take a few phone calls. 
[01:43:00]  If I did not love Adam Carolla, then I would not love my business being here.  Right.  All right.  And I'm just saying, I'm saying tonight, Steve, it's important that you love Adam Carolla.  Just don't love him.  Oh, my God.  Let me start.  Don't love on him.  I love Adam Carolla so hard.  Over here, buddy.  That I will literally love Adam Carolla.  It's to the ground.  Let me, what about, I want to see a couple of your tattoos for when we take some phone calls. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, ask me for a tattoo, brother, man.  I know you got one of Angelina Jolie or Billy Bob Thornton or something like that.  You got the Billy, that's your Billy Bob one.  What is that?  Yeah.  What is this one down here that looks like it's a phone call?  Now, dude, I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness.  I thought you loved me.  I will kill you.  Oh, a second ago, you loved me. 
[01:44:00]  I love you.  Don't help me.  Don't help me.  Easy, easy, buddy.  We got to finish the segment.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Hold on.  Steve.  I'm all right.  I'm trying to kill him.  All right.  All right, Steve.  Let's call the phone.  Buddy. 
[01:44:30]  Let me take some phone calls.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's take some phone calls.  Oh, okay.  My mic flew off, so I got to use this segment.  All right.  This is great.  I feel like a Geraldo.  Oh, no, Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Don't break the feet.  All right.  Steve.  That was a rental.  I don't like that.  That was a rental, Steve.  I don't like that.  That was a rental.  All right, Steve.  Yeah, bitch.  Steve, hold on a second.  Hey, I'll tell you what I think we should do. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  I was going to take some phone calls, Steve, but you're not playing.  You're not playing along.  I don't play.  I don't play.  Steve, if you can mind your P's and Q's.  I don't play.  We can take a couple phone calls and do a TV show.  Yeah, I don't play.  Drunk repeating guy.  I don't play.  Yeah, I don't play.  All right, all right.  I don't play.  All right, so we'll get security.  We'll run the rest of the Jimmy Kimmel show. 
[01:45:30]  And we'll be right back after this.  Oh, watch out, Steve.  Steve, watch out.  Holy crap, man.  That is the most fucked up I've ever seen anyone on television.  Yeah.  Ever.  Who else is more fucked up than that?  Dean Martin.  Dino.  Judy Garland.  He just knew how to.  He knew how to handle it a little better.  You just sit there in the tux and you smile with the cigarette. 
[01:46:00]  Martini glass in one hand.  Yeah, he just.  He never saw Dino like.  Ah.  He never saw Dean jump over and choke Ed McMahon on the couch.  Oh, never saw that.  Wow, that is fucked up.  Well, Ben's been trying to get Steve-O on the show all day.  Usually when he does something like this, you know, we're able to get him on the show immediately.  No, huh?  But, uh, we still can't find him.  And I guess he.  He could finally have died in a hotel room somewhere.  He lost his cell phone or whatever.  So, this is what you get if you call Steve-O's number today. 
[01:46:30]  Sorry, you can't leave a message for.  Dude and dudettes, I lost my phone.  So, give me your info.  Ha, ha, ha.  This mailbox is full.  To leave a message for someone else, press 2.  To log in to the messaging system, press star 5.  So, there you go.  He lost his phone.  Yeah.  That's awesome. 
[01:47:00]  And everyone's trying to call him, so.  Hopefully we'll get him on the program when he wakes up.  But there's some fun numbers on his phone.  Oh, no shit.  He's probably got a lot of people's phone numbers.  Johnny Knoxville.  That's the new thing on TV.  Get drunk and go on TV and make a full of yourself.  He's getting hammered?  Well, Tara Reid.  We're going to get into that a little later.  And her disaster of a TV show.  He cut his leg up, though, they said, also.  Yeah.  Blood, they said, sprayed all over the set.  He doesn't play.  He doesn't play.  He doesn't play. 
[01:47:30]  It's tippy time.  Tippy time.  Tippy time.  But there you have it.  The latest from Steve-O and what he's been up to.  Fantabulous.  Maybe we should have pitched that idea.  You and I just get really drunk and beat up.  And do what we do.  Get drunk.  And we go on other people's shows.  Right.  And smash their set.  That would have been our best.  Try to choke them to death.  It's like Steve-O meets Tara Dice.  Right.  That's exactly what it is.  This is very hard to do this with Bill over there.  You know what?  Jimmy never sits here. 
[01:48:00]  No, I know.  That's a problem.  Because it's too close and too far.  Like, I have to turn to make eye contact with Bill.  I don't care.  And then I have to turn back for Opie.  It's very...  Well, logically...  It doesn't work.  Logically, that microphone would have stretched over.  And then Bill could have sat exactly where he was sitting.  But that's all right.  Richard, you want to do another song?  Hell yeah, baby.  Let's do that song by my good friend Pink Floyd.  I need Billy over there.  Do you want me to sing to Anthony?  Or do you want me to sing to Opie?  Or Bill?  I can only pick one.  Because of the microphones. 
[01:48:30]  The audience.  All right.  I'll sing to everybody.  Play to the room, man.  This is from our brand new CD coming out in January.  We don't need no education.  We don't need no thought control.  No dark sarcasm in that classroom.  Teacher, leave those kids alone. 
[01:49:00]  Hey...  Teacher, leave the kids alone.  All in all, it's just another brick in the wall.  All in all, it's just another brick in the...  Opie and Anthony, can I ask you a question?  Certainly, Richard. 
[01:49:30]  How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?  How can you not...  What is it?  Pudding, meat...  How?  Oh, no, you didn't.  Two, three, four.  Whoa.  Thank you very much.  You blew it.  You blew it.  The kids with their pink Floyd.  All right.  He's got to go.  What time is it?  Well, you'd like him to go.  What time?  Your band has to leave. 
[01:50:00]  I'm getting in my...  Wait, in my ear.  Yeah.  What is Ben saying from the office?  That's right, Ben.  Mary Carey's going to be on the show soon, so get the band out.  Is she going to be in the studio today?  Yeah.  I can't wait to hear what other basketball player she's fucking.  Bobby, you're going to miss Mary Carey in the studio.  He's got to go to JFK, so thanks for having us on.  I'll head out, too.  I'll just sit in the back and watch her.  Is it very important?  Where's he going?  He's got to actually, he's got a church gig back in Samoa.  He's a Filipino. 
[01:50:30]  He's going back to the, he's going back to Bataan.  Whatever.  But, yeah, he's got to go back to L.A.  He's got a gig.  Bova Fett.  You want to take us out with one more, Richard G?  Hell yeah, baby.  And you can, obviously, you can hang.  I'll just mess with you.  I'll stay all day.  I like you guys.  All right.  Let's read a special song by my good friend Snoop Doggy Dog.  All right.  Bobby Ricotta on the piano.  Thank you so much for having us on, kids.  With so much drama in the LBC, it's kind of hard being Snoop D-O-double-G. 
[01:51:00]  But I, somehow, someway, keep coming up with funky ass shit every single day.  I got bitches in the living room getting it on.  And they ain't leaving till six in the morning.  So we're going to smoke an ounce to this.  Cheese up, hose down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this. 
[01:51:30]  Rolling down the street, smoking in dough.  Sip it on, gin and juice.  Laid back.  With my mind on my money and my money on my mind.  Rolling down the street, smoking in dough.  Sip it on, gin and juice.  Biatch.  With my mind on my money and my money.  On Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  Thank you very much. 
[01:52:00]  Good night.  Very nice.  I love richardcheese.com is the website.  Do not go there.  Thank you.  Hi, this is Jon Bon Jovi.

[01:52:30]  It's a mountain one to stay.  Oh, I love this.  Sure is.  Wow.  He shows 36 double D's.  He shows 36 double D's.  Shoving your breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D's.  He shows 36 double D's.  Oh, wow.  Hey, this looks hurt now.

[01:53:00]  Whip them fuckers out. 
[01:53:30]  This is fantastic.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Let's talk about the boobies.  Let's go now, let's go now. 
[01:54:00]  Take your bra and take it off now.  Let's go now, let's go now.  Let's go now, let's go now.  Let's go now, let's go now. 
[01:54:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:55:00]  Chew, chew, chew.  Swallow.  Mouth is all full.  At least you're not eating that gravel.  Gravely soft granola.  Yeah, that's the first real food I've ever seen a meat.  It's an actual sandwich.  I ate the rocks before the show.  The rocks and twigs.  You did?  Yeah, I just need a little more today.  You have to eat like through the entire show?  Is that what you do?  Yeah, my blood sugar thing.  Totally healthy, but for some reason I've got to continue eating the whole time.  He is leaving. 
[01:55:30]  Say bye.  That's me.  Oh, hey, Richard.  Yeah, I'm going to take off.  Thank you very much.  I'm going to sit in the corner.  I'll stay here, but there's a chair shortage.  Yeah.  Although I'd like Mary Carey to sit on me, I don't think she'll go for it.  These are for you fellas.  These are the official Apertise for Destruction shirts.  Oh, wow.  I think these are too big.  I'll make you guys some larges if you don't like XL.  Wow.  Is this going to fit anybody?  Is that you there?  Nice.  Oh, wait.  Will this fit me?  You can wear any size around the house.  That's right. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  My mixing guy, he always gets the shirts and his wife goes, oh, you've got a night shirt.  Thanks, honey.  It's pajamas.  Anyway, fellas, thanks a lot for having me on.  I appreciate your support over the years.  Richard, thank you.  Just so you know, this is it.  This is my last appearance ever.  Why?  Because I'm retiring.  This is it.  Oh, really?  Until we do the reunion tour next year to make the money.  So, farewell.  God bless y'all and thanks to the ONA listeners.  We'll see you guys soon.  What's the website?  iloverrichardcheese.com.  And make sure you give the I Love Dick thong to Mary Carey. 
[01:56:30]  Well.  In fact, see if you can get her to put it on during the show.  If she ever shows, I think she's like an hour late already.  All right.  Well, I'll sit here until she gets here.  Sitting on some NBA cock.  Doesn't want to get up.  She loves the basketball players.  Oh, my God.  She's got stories.  She just fucks them all.  Every single one.  Married, not married.  She doesn't care.  She fucks them all.  Is she the one that came in that one time with that other one that we made cry?  Yes.  And she was crying.  You were here that day.  Oh, yeah.  You were here for that, too?  Yeah.  God, you've been a part of some big shows. 
[01:57:00]  That was a good one.  Oof.  A lot of people forgot that you were here for the, what's his name there, Bernie Geth show.  Yeah, the past of the first two times.  Oh, and then I was also here for that hard rock thing when all the, your,  the racist segment of your fan base showed up.  Damn, when we were doing the live broadcast on the hard rock thing.  Yeah, it was really, what the fuck kind of show is this?  Oh.  Well, yes, there is a certain element of our fan base that doesn't seem to know where,  like, a joke ends and true hatred begins. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  They kind of skate over that line like it's not even there.  Not even there.  Yeah.  And they think we just love it.  You know what I mean?  Huh?  You get it?  You guys, right?  Right?  I'm doing what you do.  You and you.  It's the same thing, right?  No, well, it's a little subtle difference.  Holy shit.  Ben, is this true?  Yeah.  No, I've been.  Ben.  I've been worried.  Bye, Richard.  Thanks, guys.  Bernie Getz.  Being the one-year anniversary, it's been so hard to get Bernie back after the last incident. 
[01:58:00]  I saw some of his emails.  Did I forward you the ones from yesterday now?  Uh-huh.  He's worried about his campaign votes and so.  Right.  He's running for not mayor anymore.  He's running for what?  I don't even.  Some type of.  Some squirrel.  I don't know.  BernieGetz.com.  Controller.  Bernie from mayor.  That's what he's running for.  But he may come in next week.  Oh.  He's worried about Opie's temper.  My temper?  Yeah.  A guy that shot four people is worried about Opie's temper.  Well, that was the last time he came in.  He hasn't been in.  And the funniest part? 
[01:58:30]  He's got valid concerns.  Have another.  My temper?  Yeah.  So maybe he's.  Are you kidding me?  No.  I went to his website and read his whole platform on everything.  Is it a manifesto?  It is a manifesto.  He has his platform and it involves everything from vegetarianism to squirrels to the economy  of New York.  What we can do to better.  And then he's got like some kind of crime and punishment segment. 
[01:59:00]  He's got a shot for people on the subway.  He was sending emails saying he would never do our show again.  Yeah, but he's worried about it.  He's trying to win this office now.  So now he needs that.  We can get him elected.  He also said he read that he, yesterday that XM had five million subscribers.  So he's like, ooh, that could help.  Ah, see?  My whole goal if he comes in next week.  Everybody sells out.  That's right.  Even Bernie gets.  My whole goal if he comes in next week is to make him snap again.  Oh, wow.  We definitely post.  We should definitely search him this time. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, that would be nice considering the last time he ran out of the studio and went  for a bag and we didn't know what the fuck was in the bag.  Yet none of us ran.  We all said, look at him.  What's he doing?  He ran.  He was like, what?  What are you doing?  By the way, I just saw the president is going to give an address on the war on terror.  Could someone tape that just so we can see if there's anything new in this fucking speech  that he's going to give?  Anything remotely new? 
[02:00:00]  Or is it the same friggin' speech?  There can't be anything new.  He's not going to say we're pulling out.  He's not going to say we're sending more troops.  He's not going to say that.  He will say nothing.  Things going on according to plan.  Right on.  We're all scared.  We're going to stay the course.  America's a strong nation.  Strong.  We need to fight terror.  Terror there.  Terror here.  We're going to rout out terrorists.  We got them on the run.  Drummage can't hide.  Ink a bink bottle of ink, cork fit out, and you stink. 
[02:00:30]  What?  What?  Can you say something that makes any sense?  Run, can't hide.  Don't burn a hand.  Two terrorists in the bush, and we're going to get them.  What?  We are?  Man, we're going to fly.  Have a couple of wings on them.  Yeah?  When is this speech happening, Sue?  If they put it up on the news, I'm sure it'll happen soon.  We'll have it for tomorrow's show.  But yeah, for tomorrow's show, I mean, I just, I got to hear if there's anything new. 
[02:01:00]  And what's going on with Michael Brown, former head of FEMA?  This poor, stupid son of a bitch.  I feel bad for him now.  He is the scapegoat of the whole Katrina debacle.  Obviously, he fucked up as the head of FEMA.  He wasn't quite managing the emergency like the E and the M part of FEMA says he's supposed to do.  So when these disasters happen, FEMA swoops in, and they're supposed to take care of everything, basically. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  They're supposed to be the guys that organize whatever aid is needed and take care of business.  And this guy's the head of it.  He had no experience beforehand in emergency management.  He was supposed to stop the hurricane.  Right.  Get in the way and halt.  And this is what New Orleans heard.  Instead of them swooping in, this is what they heard for about a week.  And the finger-pointing just will not stop.  Everyone is blaming everybody when the truth of the matter is everyone that was in charge of anything was to blame. 
[02:02:00]  Because none of them really picked up the ball and did anything.  From the mayor all the way up to the president.  Not even the mayor.  From some of the heads of these little elected officials from these parishes.  What the fuck is a parish?  Is that the only place they use that term?  What happened to town?  The town of Islip.  Things like that.  Only down there you get the parish.  It's just another creepy southern backwards term. 
[02:02:30]  Haven't gotten cable yet?  Yeah.  Here in the parish.  A little house on the prairie.  Didn't they live in a parish?  Sleepy eye?  What was that?  A township?  I don't know.  What's that?  A township?  But everything.  All these little elected officials all the way up to the president.  It was just a clusterfuck.  And then this brown clown is thrown out of office.  The head of FEMA.  And now they have this little investigation going on.  So he's being questioned by a bipartisan committee. 
[02:03:00]  And they are ripping him an ass.  Like he's the one guy.  They hold him up and go, well.  Because if they can find one guy to blame, then they're not to blame.  Their buddies aren't to blame.  Just this guy.  But it's...  That must be amazing when you realize that you're going to be the guy.  You're the guy.  How awful is that?  You're pointing to it.  Yeah.  It's him.  And all of a sudden, they all start coming at you.  It's like, no, wait a minute.  No one's pointing at the guy I'm pointing at.  I'm a guy.  Wow.  That is bad, man.  Then you're walking with that Lee Harvey Oswald lump on your eye going, yeah, okay, I'm the 
[02:03:30]  patsy.  I'm the patsy.  Something just shoots you right in the stomach.  Done.  Problem solved.  It was all him.  He's dead.  Now let's move on with our lives.  Yeah.  Everyone is pointing at this guy.  The lone gunman.  The truth of the matter is they're all guilty of neglecting the situation.  But he's still trying.  You know, God bless him.  He's still pointing his fingers.  They sat him down at this committee, and he would not take responsibility.  We got some audio of that.  Let's go to it right now. 
[02:04:00]  The session amounted to a bipartisan public flogging.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  I don't know how you can say that.  You were clueless.  How do you get an F minus?  Who the fuck is that guy?  Some congressional friggin' committee member.  Some awful guy who now, you know, his buddy's down there.  Could be responsible.  But, you know, we got to make this guy the fall guy.  How does one get an F minus?  F minus in my book. 
[02:04:30]  I hate all that shit.  Let's give 110%.  And you realize watching these, you know, they're boring as shit to watch.  But you realize if you sit down and watch them for a while, when you watch these congressmen,  senators sitting down at these committees and talking, and it's on C-SPAN or wherever it is,  they have no charisma, no panache, they have no material, they use old, worn-out cliches,  their public speaking is awful, they shake, they're just like your stupid neighbor. 
[02:05:00]  You love to think that there's something more, that the government, man, they're running things,  it's got to be something more.  No, these guys are idiots.  I like when they try to present, like, their catchphrase for the election,  and they try to put some sort of, like, just any sort of acting or any sort of personality into it.  Like, remember John Kerry?  The Punisher!  John Kerry, he comes up, like, saluting, he's like,  Senator Kerry reporting for duty.  And you're like, what? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, like Hillary Clinton.  Her big thing goes, she goes, she's like, enough is enough.  And you know, they told her to say it twice to make the point,  and then she gets this hacky applause bag, and she's like, enough is enough.  I can't vote for you.  No.  You're not even a person.  It's not like your batteries are wearing that.  People are buying this shit out there.  She has the worst machine delivery of any politician.  She does that slow build thing. 
[02:06:00]  We as Americans need to be more concerned about our people in New Orleans.  Who the fuck?  Plus, I like how she even got in there.  Yeah, I was married to a guy who did this, so yeah.  Something rubs off.  My boyfriend's a construction worker, so yeah, I'd like to build a house.  Yeah, there's something wrong there.  My career brought me to the White House as a wife of the fucking president,  but I picked out the dishes for the big dinners we used to have. 
[02:06:30]  That's very important duty.  I know my way around.  Right.  She is the worst.  Let's go back to reporting for duty.  That was so badly staged.  If you could find either one of those clips, I'm not even exaggerating that bad.  Yeah, and some of the papers actually had the picture of him saluting with reporting for duty,  trying to make it a catchphrase.  Oof.  Looking like Harvin Munster.  Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa, I'm reporting for duty, Grandpa. 
[02:07:00]  Eddie, Eddie, salute your father, Eddie.  All right, let's get back to the audio of the congressional hearing.  These guys are just like you and I.  They're nothing special.  You'll see them in the restaurants and the bars when they're not working,  trying to get as much booze into their fat, bloated faces, just like we do.  And they're just holier than thou in these situations.  Oh, yeah.  Just, I'm giving you an F minus.  I'm taking you to task.  Right.  How about I look at your record and I grade it on the high school grading that you're giving me. 
[02:07:30]  I'm fucking, I'm a professional, been working for years, been out of school,  and this motherfucker's going to knock me back down to high school level and give me an F.  You, sir, get no stars.  Yeah, like that.  Oh, no glittery gold star for you today, sir.  I couldn't go to summer school long enough in my book.  You, sir, get a frowny face.  The guy's grading his clay camp ashtray he made.  If it was up to me, you would stay indoors for recess. 
[02:08:00]  That's how bad your hurricane coverage was.  You'll have no extracurricular activities.  What a scumbag.  Let's go to the F minus guy.  The session amounted to a bipartisan public flogging.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  In my book.  I don't know how you can't sleep at night.  You were clueless about what was happening.  But the, this sounds, this sounds like my parents talking to me when I was like 15 years old. 
[02:08:30]  And there he is sitting there.  I was just doing, no one told me anything.  You pick any day last week and that same committee could be talking to me.  You are absolutely clueless.  You know, Bill, in my book, F minus, in his book.  What book?  You get an F minus in my book.  In my book.  This is the speech you get when you miss curfew when you were a kid.  Yeah.  From your parents. 
[02:09:00]  This guy is an adult.  He was the head of FEMA.  Regardless of how badly he fucked up, he's an adult.  He's being scolded like a five-year-old.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's taking a turn around the room.  Now I had to back up again.  Listen.  Hi, Alon.  Bipartisan public flogging.  You folks fell on your face.  Right.  You get an F minus in my book.  I don't know how you can't sleep at night.  You were clueless about what was happening.  But the embattled former FEMA director gave it back.  I've overseen over 150 presidentially declared disasters. 
[02:09:30]  I know what I'm doing.  Indeed, though he admitted to some mistakes,  Brown unabashedly placed much of the blame for Katrina chaos with local Louisiana officials.  My biggest mistake was not recognizing by Saturday that Louisiana was dysfunctional.  When he would say things like this,  my mistake, you're thinking he's going to go,  my mistake was not getting resources in there quickly enough. 
[02:10:00]  My mistake was not making sure the communication lines were open between me and the people that need it.  My mistake was not seeing what a fuck up this was.  He's saying his whole mistake was not realizing how fucked up that place was from the get-go.  There's some real responsibility grabbing.  God damn, but you know something?  Can you blame the guy?  He goes around the room, they just lambast him,  and he's supposed to be now the last guy that just bashes himself? 
[02:10:30]  I'd be trying to pull myself out of the barrel, too.  Also, he was saying it's my fault that I didn't realize how fucked up New Orleans was.  How fucked up New Orleans was.  Before the hurricane.  Before the hurricane.  Exactly.  No communication.  The mayor and the fucking governor can't stand each other.  You know what, that's a good way to go.  It is a good way.  That's why when I saw this yesterday, I was like,  God damn, he's sharp.  That's the great way to go.  He contended that the mayor and governor ignored his call for evacuations  and that the state was too mired in political infighting to let FEMA work. 
[02:11:00]  I very strongly, personally regret that I was unable to persuade Governor Blanco and Mayor Nagin  to sit down, get over their differences, and work together.  Blanco called the charges shocking, and Nagin...  Obviously, Mr. Brown is, you know, maybe under a lot of pressure.  You know, I feel kind of sorry for him.  Since Katrina, that was perfect.  That is perfect.  He pretty much just said, look, the guy's having a nervous breakdown. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I feel sorry.  No, but he handled it.  He didn't lose his shit.  Like, don't try to pin it on me.  He painted the other guy as a psycho.  Oh, look.  He's having a really bad day.  Obviously, a lot of pressure.  I'm going to take the high road.  It's taking its toll.  It's a lot of pressure.  Look, and then finishing it with, I feel sorry for the guy.  What a bunch of scumbags.  Since Katrina, fairly or unfairly, Brown has emerged as the national scapegoat and late-night punching bag. 
[02:12:00]  No word yet on Mr. Brown's future plans.  Those sources say he does want to spend more time doing nothing for his family.  But the drubbing on the hill was as bad as it gets.  I want to know how you coordinated the evacuation.  By urging the governor and the mayor to order the mandatory evacuation.  And that's coordinating?  What would you like for me to do, Congressman?  Well, that's why I'm happy you left.  I guess you want me to be the superhero that is going to step in there and suddenly take everybody out of New Orleans. 
[02:12:30]  I like this guy.  What I wanted you to do was do your job of coordinating.  Oh, oh, oh!  You know something?  The motherfucker delegated responsibility to the mayor and the governor of that state.  And they did nothing.  This is what just happened.  That guy who asked the question about coordinating thought he was just going to get away with it.  Right.  And then the guy threw it back in his face.  Well, what would you have me do?  And he's like, uh, coordinate your job, sir. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, he didn't even know what the fuck.  He didn't have an answer for him.  He just wants to get on CNN so he can have his I'm outraged clip.  I like this guy, though.  You're absolutely right.  I like the way he operates.  Yo, what the fuck am I supposed to do?  What a guy, a fucking cape, you asshole?  He should have dropped the F-bomb.  What the fuck was I supposed to do?  Take everybody out by their hand?  I told him to fucking leave.  Yeah.  Mandatory evacuation.  Now, mayor, governor, get your people the fuck out.  Next question.  Fatty with the red tie.  Yeah, I would love to see one of those guys do that.  You might as well.  You're going to get fired. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  And then you know what?  He is fired.  He's done.  He is fired.  He doesn't even have to be there at that point.  And then all of a sudden, every moron with a pickup truck, whatever that fucking guy's  name is, so-and-so for president.  And he said, fuck.  I like this guy.  They love him.  I think we have another track here.  Michael Brown's isolated comments.  I've overseen over 150 presidentially declared disasters.  I know what I'm doing.  My biggest mistake was not recognizing by Saturday that Louisiana was dysfunctional. 
[02:14:00]  I very strongly, personally, regret that I was unable to persuade Governor Blanco and Mayor  Negan to sit down, get over their differences, and work together.  I want to know how you coordinated the evacuation.  By urging the governor and the mayor to order the mandatory evacuation.  Beautiful.  And that's coordinating?  Yeah.  What would you like for me to do, Congressman?  Well, that's why I'm happy you left. 
[02:14:30]  I guess you want me to be this superhero that is going to step in there and suddenly take  everybody out of New Orleans.  No.  No.  What I wanted you to do was do your job of coordinating.  That right there gets an applause break on Oprah.  Absolutely.  What you people need to do is get a job.  Get a job.  Woo!  Woo!  He didn't say anything.  Do your job.  That's why I'm glad you left.  Yeah, you're out.  Good.  That's why I'm glad.  You see him in the voice.  He was literally regrouping there. 
[02:15:00]  Like, oh, fuck.  He had nothing.  Now he's making me look like a shithead.  That guy, he should have dropped the F-ball.  Absolutely.  And that one guy sounded really squirrely.  Like, very just nerdy.  You think he wanted a piece of him outside?  FEMA is supposed to manage and delegate responsibility like that.  He should have described Louisiana even harsher.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Dysfunctional.  It was too PC.  He should have just been like, look, had I known how fucked up that state was? 
[02:15:30]  They just know.  And it's coming out now.  The police, the head of the New Orleans Police Department quit.  Now, these slight rumors, allegations are coming up that they said that 500 or so cops walked  off the job and left and have not returned.  Now they're saying they can only find 80 of these cops that actually walked off.  They're starting to insinuate that perhaps hundreds of cops are on the New Orleans payroll 
[02:16:00]  and do not exist.  Every three years, 60 minutes, does something on New Orleans.  Yeah.  How fucked up a town it is.  How corrupt it is.  It's very corrupt.  So where's this pay going?  Oof.  Can you imagine?  Oh.  Well, they'll get to the bottom of that.  Yeah.  Let's send them billions of dollars to fix that damn.  Yeah.  Whew.  Awful.  Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  What do you guys say?  Yep.  This bit had so much promise in the beginning. 
[02:16:30]  Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, it's too late.  Oh, boy.  Steve.  People really enjoy the Jetson cart thing.  I'm glad I fucked it up today.  And you really fucked it up.  I was so glad.  I'm so glad.  People just laugh and laugh and laugh over that one.  And they talk about it over and over again.  They say it's one of the best things we've done recently.  And you just casually walk in without the thing.  I think it's horribly egocentric to walk in and go, excuse me, can I have my sound, please?  Isn't that a little too?  No, not at all.  It's called being a team player. 
[02:17:00]  If I knew what that word meant, I would agree with you, I guess.  Thank you.  All right.  Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  Right.  Do we want to go down this road again?  Sure.  Steve, are they getting better?  They are getting better.  People are actually figuring out the concept of a movie trailer.  And they're assembling what?  He's like paranoid now.  I attacked him one day.  I'm agreeing with you.  Like, yeah, they're fucking idiots.  Exactly.  They are grasping the concept of a movie trailer. 
[02:17:30]  They're putting coherent drops in sequence, and it's telling a story, and there's dramatic  music behind it, so they are improving.  I still have to filter through about 15 to get six of them that are decent.  All right.  Sometime next week, we're going to do the top five best Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  Right.  Just to make it a little fun for everybody.  Okay.  So we're going to attempt to listen to a few of these now.  Are you saying this one's really good?  I'm saying that's the only one that came in last night, so I didn't want to burn, I didn't  want to re-burn the entire other disc. 
[02:18:00]  Okay.  So it's not that good?  It's the best one that came in last night.  I got four last night, and that's the only one that was worth committing to a disc.  All right.  The first Opie and Anthony movie trailers by Justin.  It says, take two.  What does that mean?  Oh, he tried once.  He tried once.  We bashed him, so he shot another one at us.  Oh, he's back.  Oh, he's back.  Hey, and if these aren't good, we're going to blame you like the head of FEMA.  It's nothing new.  You are not doing your job.  That is nothing new.  I have been a scapegoat many times. 
[02:18:30]  Here we go.  In a time when censorship rules the land.  You can't say that now.  And originality no longer exists.  All of the radio rips me up.  One radio program dares to tell the truth to the American people.  Fuck you, asshole.  Opium and Anthony, I'm pleasure for me always.  Starring Opie.  Because I don't know what was going on that day, fuckface.  Anthony.  I'm getting dressed up.  I need some stats. 
[02:19:00]  And featuring Jim Norton.  I have the metabolism of a glacier.  Our heroes take on the queen of all media in the biggest pat battle the world has ever known.  I'm brilliant every day.  Every single friggin' day.  Thank you.  Holy shit, are you kidding me?  I invented cursing, Robin.  Fuck.  I said that first, and you're fucking pissing me off.  Stop it.  Aw, don't get all angry and yell.  Fuck, say anything I want.  How could you say that?  I invented everything.  I invented the satellite, Robin. 
[02:19:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Can you shut up?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up, bitch.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Opie and Anthony versus Howard Stern.  Coming January 2006.  And it's going to get ugly.  That's pretty good, actually.  I like that one.  Not bad.  What do you think, Steve?  They're improving.  They're improving.  I mean, if you pull the actual production value out of it and listen just for story and 
[02:20:00]  context, that was good.  Well, they don't have the same machines that you work with.  Exactly.  That's why I'm not really being too critical of that.  All right.  The next one is Jim Norton Returns.  This is from Screech in Philly.  Decent concept?  Decent concept.  He first blew you under the porch.  We would pretend that it was raining monster rain, and we would go under a porch and blow each  other.  Next, he interviewed at Ozfest.  You did something in a dress.  I don't...  It was fucking...  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Tim from YSP was telling me that you did something in a dress. 
[02:20:30]  I don't know what it was.  If you want to stay in a dress, did you do something in a public with a dress?  Coming this Halloween.  He's back!  Jimmy Norton Returns.  In a tale of debauchery.  You get that same girl, Julie, to sit on my face because she would wet her pants all  the time.  I like the way it smelled.  He preys on the souls of the young.  I don't go to bed with other men.  Even if I was, I'd molest your children.  It craves the affection of the elderly. 
[02:21:00]  Do you know what that one sounds like?  Can you play that one more time?  Can you picture a cancer patient laying on his side with active feet legs?  That's what that one sounds like.  It's that like a cancer patient.  Listen, it was long.  Oh, we love you, pop-pop.  Jim Norton Returns are coming this Halloween.  All right, that's not bad.  Not bad, not shabby.  The concept is there, too.  Yeah.  Jimmy's coming back for three days, I don't know, in another week or so. 
[02:21:30]  No way, really?  He comes back for three days and then goes right back out to Hollywood for another three  weeks.  All right, that was Screech and Philly.  Moving on, this is by Damien.  A love story.  This was cute.  This avoids the whole big whoosh-bang dramatic music adventure movie thing and goes the very  sweet, light-hearted route.  Ah!  Love is an accident waiting to happen. 
[02:22:00]  Desire is a stranger you think you know.  I know I'm the whore on the side.  You're never going to leave your wife.  Intimacy is a lie we tell ourselves.  Take it easy, man.  Stay in touch.  All right.  All right, y'all take care.  See you, mate.  So awkward having, like, one chick on the phone and the other chick right here in the studio.  Truth is a game.  We play to win.  Being cordial to each other, but, you know, eh, you know, banging's going on. 
[02:22:30]  Sometimes we hurt the ones we love the most.  At a stage four damage, I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  If you believe in love at first sight.  Bill Burns, studio.  Fucking idiotism.  You gotta make it too much.  You never stop looking.  Me or her.  Whack Bag Pictures presents.  I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  In association with Ben's hog.  He's literally busting a nut in this girl's face.  It's horrific.  A story of love.  Fuckin' naked and hug in the woods.  Betrayal. 
[02:23:00]  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed.  A foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot.  And the assholes that we all have.  O&A, a love story.  Wow.  He almost pulled it off.  I don't know.  That one's pretty good.  You like it?  Yeah, it's one of those sensitive ones.  Yeah, it's a very sensitive one.  He littered it with the stupid movie cliches that all those trailers have.  Yeah.  It's the same stupid lines over and over again that can apply to any one of those movies.  And it's showing our confusion. 
[02:23:30]  It's like, do we love Jimmy Norton or do we love Bill Burr?  We don't know.  We don't like it.  We don't know.  How is this going to end?  Yeah.  I got a good idea.  You do?  Yeah.  What the fuck does that mean?  Coming to the stage in the Aku Aku in Worcester.  Keep it going for your headliner.  Bill Burr.  How's it going?  I haven't seen a poo-poo part of it since I moved up.  All right.  Here's Mark in North Carolina. 
[02:24:00]  Another O&A movie trailer.  Norton had me dying.  And how are you describing that?  Opie and Anthony, New York's highest rated radio show.  Young boy in the lad bag.  It's just that he would be confused and trying to turn it out.  And the little feet noise would be crinkle, crinkle in a little bag.  They had everything they could possibly want.  Can't arrest the voyeur bus.  This is legal, isn't it?  Of course, we're getting ready for the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony. 
[02:24:30]  That is until they faced the unexpected.  We're in St. Patrick's, and he's doing the balloon knot inside, and that security guy is coming up to us right now.  All right.  How many?  All right.  Hey, come on.  Let them go.  They're okay there.  No, let them go.  Thanks.  Our shock jocks going too far.  This week, New York-based DJs Opie and Anthony were fired.  Anyway, you know, those are the guys who had little contests on their show. 
[02:25:00]  They wanted people to have sex in surprising places.  And St. Patrick's, I found that rather a surprising place to have sex.  On a movie trailer.  They spent two years out of commission.  One time, Anthony called me, and I was actually on the X where JFK got shot.  The governor of New Jersey's gay, and we're not on the air?  Who saw Dr. Zachary Smith from Lost in Space dying while we were off the air?  The nerve.  Then, like a shining beacon in the sky, they saw their destiny.  Can I just say fuck?  Beyond AM, beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:25:30]  They got a second chance to face their enemies.  Your name is not really Opie, okay?  What the bleacher problem, man?  Radio edit.  Greg Hughes.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  That's your dad.  Nah.  Anthony Cumia.  Yeah, North.  Well, the West Side, I think, sir, is this band. 
[02:26:00]  Jim Norton.  I don't care.  Just throw your ex-hand down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and then fuck your mother.  Steve Hardisi.  Ramon, clean this up.  Ben Sparks.  Boopie, and Anthony.  The virus.  There is no antidote.  Holy crap.  That was way too long.  Holy crap.  I remember what happened with this one. 
[02:26:30]  Mark sent in four or five different versions, and each time I kept, I was trying to be polite.  Oh, my God.  I just say, keep trying.  Oh, my God.  Keep trying.  That is way too long.  Oh, my God.  A good length for these would be 60 seconds.  60 seconds, get in, tell your story, get out.  That was almost three minutes long.  People have been with us today with the movie trailer thing,  but that one just took a lot of people out of the game.  We've got just a couple more Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  Let's move right on to John S. in Hartford, Connecticut.  This feels like a telethon now. 
[02:27:00]  Still want to raise another 30 grand, people.  Yeah, here's his try at an Opie and Anthony movie trailer.  An epidemic is spreading throughout the nation.  Reports are flying in from all over the country now.  It appears we're not going to be able to stop it.  We're going to have to hope to contain it.  A plague of talentless female radio co-hosts.  I read somewhere that their periods attract bears.  Ruining what could potentially be an adequate morning program.  You hear that, Ed? Bears.  Now you're putting the whole station in jeopardy.  No one is safe. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, man, look, I don't know what to tell you guys.  Got handed to me from corporate. It's out of my hands.  Not even Opie and Anthony.  You've got a fucking hole.  No!  ONA Films, in association with Walt Disney Pictures, presents...  Holes 2, The Attack of the Vag.  Uh, believe it or not, Alexander, more gay than Troy was.  And Troy, pretty gay.  I guess I think you're gay.  Brad Pitt is like my husband.  Oh. 
[02:28:00]  How are the hookers treating you?  Now that is just wrong.  Nobody wants to hear about that.  No self-respecting woman would ever do that as a profession.  And I think you guys are just promoting the degradation of women.  Oh, fucking kill me, Opie.  Anthony.  And in the role she was born to play, an overexposed, no-talent, emphysematic twat,  Tara Reid stars in Holes 2, The Attack of the Vag.  Oh my gosh, you guys, this is Tara Reid broadcasting live from Rome, which is where thousands and thousands 
[02:28:30]  of Jews were tortured and killed on Earth's way wide, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Holes 2, The Plague is spreading.  Now playing at OneMarkets and stations everywhere.  Check your local station for details.  Hey, wow, that guy picked up on a lot of good stuff that we've talked about on this show.  That's not bad.  The morning shows that have to have a fucking chick in there to do absolutely nothing,  but just to balance everything out.  So it's all okay.  It's the voice of reason. 
[02:29:00]  That is really...  That was a great one.  That was a great one.  I like the concept, definitely.  All right, we're almost done here, kiddies.  This is a short one.  A song for Murder by Gage?  What is this?  This is...  Oof, I'm almost tempted to just say end on that last one.  Ah, well, we have this one, too.  It's not awful, but he was going that route of the Quinn Martin production piece,  but stacked up against the one we just heard.  I don't know.  In a world where all lounge music is ruled by one man. 
[02:29:30]  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of them.  The guys get shirts.  A hero will rise from obscurity.  I'm Richard fucking G!  To save us all, Opie and Anthony present a Quinn Martin production, a song for murder. 
[02:30:00]  Wow, that was bad.  Holy shit, that was really bad.  That was really awful.  You didn't need to give us that one.  You should hear the ones that I haven't given you.  All right.  The didgeridoo in the background.  Yeah.  Who made that one.  Here's the deal.  Horrid.  Starting tonight, when you get these, only bring the ones that might...  Not suck.  Might not suck.  Oof.  Yeah.  We're done with playing the ones that suck.  All right. 
[02:30:30]  Horrid.  I think this bit's just about over.  All right.  We have one more, Dan.  I think the new bit is like, what do you think about in the middle of one of those things?  Like, where the fuck does your mind go?  I went to a happy place in the middle of that one.  I was just thinking, I gotta buy a light for my kitchen.  Yeah, exactly.  This is Dan from opianthony.net.  I didn't plug the iron.  Another fine fan site, opianthony.net.  Here we go.  Coming this fall, three men, one console, one terrifying slam after another. 
[02:31:00]  Opie and Anthony star in The Console Slammer.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ebert and Robert give it two fists down.  Way down.  Poor his fucking phone's busy. 
[02:31:30]  The New York Times calls it confusing.  And the Church of Opie says it's downright blasphemy.  Opianthony.net presents The Console Slammer.  It'll make you laugh.  Ha ha ha.  It'll make you cry.  Oh, that's okay.  I, uh...  Nah, I don't feel like I just started radio again.  Nah, I don't feel like I'm doing overnights in god-awful Buffalo for $12,000 a year. 
[02:32:00]  Don't worry about it.  I guess I'll, uh...  I guess I'll see the secret gadgets when they hit the market in a year.  It'll make you hate the listeners even more for pointing this out.  How much abuse can one console take before it starts to fight back?  Where?  The home of the run.  Ah!  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot!  The Console Slammers.  Now playing in OPCB Play. 
[02:32:30]  Okay, terrific.  Oh, boy.  Another bad one.  Holy shit, are we going to have to regroup?  Holy mother of God.  It's sort of an original concept, though.  It was an original concept.  This wasn't enough audio to support it.  I guess we did way too long to support it.  Yes.  You primarily.  I do it a lot.  Oh, do you?  No, we all do that a lot, but...  That's what he picked up on?  Yeah, he picked up on Console Slamming and made a movie trailer.  And made a whole fucking thing out of it.  And that shit fell on Norton's foot.

[02:36:30]  I don't believe it.  Ben's hog is just big enough on my business.  Well, I do have big tips, goddammit.  Goddammit, what nice tips.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Let's not forget about that.  We do have some kind of wow line.  I don't know what's going on with that.  The promo should be running maybe later today or tomorrow at least. 
[02:37:00]  It's just another way to participate in the wow program, especially for all you truckers out there that get to see a lot from your big rigs.  If you need a sticker, we're sending out the wow stickers every single day here in New York City.  Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here.  What's the address?  111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019?  Yes.  Bingo.  That address is up on opanthony.com.  You get your wow stickers, you throw them on your ride, and I'm telling you, there are ladies out there that will flash if they see the wow. 
[02:37:30]  And ladies, if you're feeling it, do it.  We could use more ladies that are willing to participate, okay?  All right.  Also, I guess next week, Tuesday, will mark the one-year anniversary of us coming to Satellite Radio.  Wow.  One year at XM.  That went quick.  On Tuesday.  I don't know what we've got planned for next week.  We're going to play, like, old clips from our first show, our first week of shows, things like that. 
[02:38:00]  I guess we'll have some people calling in and guessing and whatnot.  But the big party, what, Eric?  One year, what do you learn?  Timing was a little off.  Yeah.  Your timing was horrendous.  You had to jump in and say that we're going to do what?  We're doing listener one year, what do you learn?  So they can go to the website and send us in.  For a whole year?  Wow. 
[02:38:30]  That's going to be a long bit.  We're going to have to read them all?  We'll filter it out.  Thanks, sir.  I didn't even...  Oh, there he goes.  He's going back to the Opie and Anthony auction.  No, his big thing is he tries not to stand in front where he can see them.  Yeah.  And yell from 20 feet away from the mic.  Holy crap, you just took me out of my game so bad.  It's not even funny.  But he's working really hard on the Opie and Anthony auction. 
[02:39:00]  That's ending very, very soon.  The link is up on opieandanthony.com.  All proceeds will help the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  And there's a few items still left.  They're all going away in about two or three days, and that'll be it for the auction.  I think we raised well over $50,000 so far, heading toward about $70,000, $75,000.  What I wanted to say, Anthony...  Yes.  Even though it's been...  We marked the year next Tuesday, I guess.  We're going to have a huge Halloween bash to officially celebrate one year at Saturday. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, we're announcing this.  One year at XM.  Yeah, it's going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe in the heart of Times Square there.  Nice.  And it's going to be great.  Anthony's band...  Anthony's band, Jesus.  Anthony's brother's band, 2U, will be playing.  Yes.  The U2 tribute band will be there.  A couple more tribute bands.  I think a Rush tribute band and an ACDC tribute band.  That's right.  And what we're looking for from our fine, faithful listeners, we want you to show up with costumes  because it's Halloween, but it's costumes that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:40:00]  Sound clip, things we talk about.  It's easy.  Us.  Guests.  We're looking for a lot of creativity.  And we're going to have some really big prizes for the winners.  So we'll have a costume contest.  We'll have the tribute bands and lots and lots of alcohol.  Okay?  Right.  So start spreading the word.  It's going to be Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe in the heart of Times Square.  It should be a nice mellow event.  Oh, holy crap.  Get there early because it's going to be just a zoo. 
[02:40:30]  A madhouse.  I think we're getting about 600 people.  That's about it.  That's about it.  And I think we're going to have some special passes we'll give out on the show, maybe for  some of the listeners that live far away and can make it to the city for the party.  We'll see.  We're figuring out the details as we speak.  Nice.  Want to say hi to Mary Carey?  Where is she?  She's a friend of the show.  We haven't talked to her in a while.  She had to wait a long time.  I'm sorry.  Holy shit.  How much weight did you lose?  I know. 
[02:41:00]  I didn't even lose.  Wow.  How much weight did you lose?  You know, I don't really know.  You look like a different person.  And I got my teeth done, too.  These are like $9,000 in your teeth here.  Really?  $9,000 for porcelain teeth.  What happened to the other ones?  They actually grind them down.  Right.  And then it's very scary.  And then they stick these things on.  And they're very sensitive.  See, I would never get rid of my original teeth unless they start falling out.  That's what's scary is if in 10 years I don't have any money and I'm broke, these are going 
[02:41:30]  to probably rot off.  That's the only thing that sucks.  How will they rot off?  I don't know.  They break down, they said.  Really?  They break down?  Yeah.  You guys, I was so good at this.  I'm glad it's so good at this.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait.  I want to just go with this for one more second.  So, they're grinding your teeth.  Don't you get a weird feeling like that you're losing something, a part of your body?  You are losing your teeth.  You do, yeah.  Yeah, it's scary if they let you see yourself in the mirror because then you're like, oh,  my God, I have sticks for teeth.  Right.  And then when I first got me in, I wasn't used to them being so big and I wouldn't  open my mouth.  I was like, oh, my God, they're so big. 
[02:42:00]  But now I like them.  You like them now?  Now you're happy with your teeth?  We have to get used to giving blowjobs.  I was like, oh, wow.  You've got to open up the mouth a little wider.  Losing weight was pretty easy.  Basically, I'm not friends with Tawny anymore.  Well, Tawny, let's back up a little bit.  Last time Mary Carey was in studio, Tawny was with her, her sidekick, and we made her  cry really bad.  Yeah, she's a complete mess of a woman.  She thought she was a mess then.  She's just here now.  Really?  She's beautiful, by the way. 
[02:42:30]  Absolutely beautiful.  She's beautiful.  And we saw you guys after the show at the Park Meridian, and she doesn't even remember  that we were the guys that made her cry because she was still crying.  And she came up and met us like she was meeting us for the first time.  And we're looking at her like, you've got tears in your eyes still because we made you  cry about an hour ago, but she doesn't remember that.  Actually, I talked to her yesterday.  So I'm going on opening and she goes, did I go on that show with you?  Oh, are you doing it?  Yes, I go.  It's like the female Steve-O.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's good.  But by stopping hanging out with her so much, because she's now dating a pimp, so I don't 
[02:43:00]  talk to her anymore.  Oh, boy.  I stopped eating the three bean cheese burritos at three in the morning every night, and I cut  back on the drinking, and it's amazing.  If you don't eat Taco Bell at three in the morning, you lose weight, you know?  Yeah, you lost a lot of weight.  I mean, you look good the other way, too.  Like, you look good fat, but...  No, I mean, but when someone loses, you've got to acknowledge it.  You lost a lot of weight.  Yeah, and it's weird.  It happens.  It happens pretty fast.  So everyone in porn, of course, because porn people think, oh, you're on crack.  And I'm like, no. 
[02:43:30]  No, they don't think that.  That's me.  I never try.  You lose weight.  Yeah, you don't have the ninja, do you?  What's the name?  No, I just stopped.  You don't have the high five, do you?  What's that?  I'm like, so...  AIDS?  Oh, no, I don't have AIDS.  No.  All right.  They think that you've got...  No, I don't have AIDS.  They think that you're on drugs.  Everyone's like, did you get drugs?  I'm like, no.  Not drinking so much.  No Taco Bell.  Did it mess up your tits?  No.  They're still good.  You want to see?  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, they are good still.  All right.  All right.  They're very nice.  The sound effect kind of ruined it, though.  I know.  Is that a bad boob sound effect?  Yeah.  What's a good boob sound effect?  Silence.  Yep.  Nothing.  Jiggle them.  My favorite boob sound effect is...  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I think everyone wants more silence.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, so this is my vagina, I guess?  Is this...  What did you do to it?  Oh, yeah.  You gave us your vagina the last time you were here, and now it's...  With a plastic finger in it. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, now it's a pencil holder.  You know, I actually always thought that they looked like that.  I'm always like, what is this, a Mary Carey pencil holder?  Like, why the mousetrap?  Who snapped a mousetrap on her labia?  Well, it's a mousetrap on a snatch.  Well, my favorite thing, the box says...  That's pretty self-explanatory.  Yeah, I thought it was, but I had to explain it to her.  It says I have full lips on it.  I have to bring up carrot top again, but he could do 20 minutes on that.  Right.  This is pretty cool.  That's a closing bit right there.  I made my boyfriend fuck my rubber vagina.  Oh, yeah?  I can say the F word, right?  Yeah, I was like out of town. 
[02:45:00]  I was actually here.  Wait, you got a boyfriend?  I have a boyfriend.  How weird is that?  No more NBA players.  No?  And only him, yeah.  He's here today.  Oh, really?  Wait, so I don't really get this thing, man.  I don't get being a porn star, but having someone you love on the side.  Well, because I'm not...  Try to explain that to me.  I haven't done a boy-girl movie for a long time.  So it's okay if you're just doing other girls?  Yeah, I actually let another girl give him a blowjob the other day to strip them.  Oh, wow, nice.  But doesn't that freak you out because you're in love with him?  No, because I was kind of like...  Because the girls would kind of look up to me at the strip clubs. 
[02:45:30]  I'm like, yeah, suck his dick.  Because I wanted to see she...  Do you realize us regular guys, if we just look at another girl on the sidewalk, we're  in deep shit.  But you porn stars, like you have this whole thing going where you're in love with some  guy, but you're screwing other guys on film, but that's okay.  I don't get it.  No, but I don't do other guys.  And you would probably shoot me.  But there's other porn stars we've talked about.  They have the same thing.  They got the guy that they're in love with, but they're still allowed to have sex on film.  Yeah, they say that bullshit.  And there's no jealousy.  See, I don't believe that.  There'd be jealousy.  I understand she's just at work.  Yeah.  That's her job. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  They don't understand.  That's called a bad relationship, in my opinion.  I mean, there's no way to understand that.  But the rules with you is he's okay with it as long as you're doing other girls on film.  Other girls.  He's going to be there.  Like, he'd get mad.  Because me and Tawny were kind of girlfriends, too, for a while.  Like, she actually gets drunk and goes to him, you stole my Mary, you know.  And we were girlfriends.  So if I were to go off with Tawny, not tell him and have sex with her, then it would be bad.  Have you always been bisexual, though?  I think so.  I remember being, like, 12 years old and, like, wanting to look at girls naked. 
[02:46:30]  Ooh.  I don't know why.  Really?  I've always liked girls.  Yeah.  But I like, I think girls look better naked, but sex with guys is way better.  And it's okay with the company you work for that you're not doing guys on film anymore?  Well, I just haven't, like, shot a movie for a while.  Because when I gained weight, I don't think they wanted to shoot me.  Then I didn't want to shoot a movie because I was, like, I'm kind of scared of, like,  porn guys now that I'm older, like, two years older than I was a couple years ago,  I realize how disgusting they are.  Like, they're pretty germy guys, man.  They're, like, having sex.  Like, it's kind of gross. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Wait, you seem like you're a changed woman.  It seems like another year or two from now you're going to be, like, a mother with your kid here.  Yeah, I don't know about that.  That porn thing is my...  I feel like they get drunk every night.  So, like, I don't think you can be a good mother when you're drunk every night.  Ah, sure you can.  You think so?  Yeah, you get the kid drunk.  They just lay there.  No, but I'm going to do movies with him, I think.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think we'll do movies with him, and maybe we'll do threesomes with other girls.  But he won't have sex with other girls, because then I would get mad.  And you get girls to blow them?  Well, we did that this week, like, last weekend, and I didn't mind. 
[02:47:30]  Why?  Was it a special occasion for you guys?  Well, no, I was drunk, and I was in a...  Black day.  I was in a strip club, I was drunk in a strip club, and the girl was all over me, and I  was like, wow, this girl will do whatever I say, because these girls are like, oh my  God, Mary Carey, you know?  So then I was like, suck his dick, and you know, isn't his dick pretty, and she did, and  then we did it together at the same time, it was fun.  And then I licked her pussy while he had sex with me.  Huh.  And we videotaped it.  Is that for...  You guys don't do that?  Well, no. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Quite a sport.  Yeah, right on.  I mean, and then it's funny, and then I told him, so we went out to dinner with his friend  and, like, conservative girlfriend, and of course, I hated the girlfriend, so I wanted  to, like, make her uncomfortable, so I start going into how I let other girls suck his dick  and stuff to make her, like, feel just, you know, like, I'm no fun, and yeah, it was  pretty bad.  I love my pussy here.  Is that the Olive Garden?  Huh?  My pussy?  No, we're at P.F. Chang's.  We're at P.F. Chang's.  I just want to get all the details.  Why'd you... 
[02:48:30]  Well, what's wrong?  I don't know.  She doesn't like how we treated her vagina.  Yeah.  I'm starting to notice.  No, I actually...  What do you think we were going to do with your vagina?  You know what's funny is I get 39 cents per once to hold.  That's all I got.  I just got a check the other day for a couple hundred bucks.  It's pretty cool.  And I'm like, I wonder what guys really do with it.  Well, ours is a pencil holder.  It's a pencil holder and a mousetrap holder.  What do you think, like, do you think...  I want to know if guys really take it and, like, put it on.  I really don't know, man.  I'm sure there are some.  Do you build a girl around it? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, it's kind of creepy.  It is.  You know, it's...  I guess if you wanted me to go with this, I would have to build some kind of a, like,  a body around it.  Let's get a testimonial from someone who uses it.  Someone needs to learn.  Oh, I loved it.  Didn't Jimmy try it out?  Oh, cute rubber vagina.  I thought Jimmy tried it out.  No, no, no.  He said he was going to, but...  Well, we need him to try it out.  Well, I don't know if we could try that one out anymore.  And we got a bunch of psychos around here that would try it out.  You should make an intern try it out.  Should we ask Bill? 
[02:49:30]  Intern Bill?  Bill would.  Yeah, let's see if Bill would do this.  My stomach dropped for half a second.  Oh, no, no, not Bill Burr.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  Am I above the line on that one?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm calmer today.  Have you guys noticed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why's that?  Oh, I took a Xanax last night, so it's, like, still kicking in.  Last night?  I took it, like, three in the morning.  I'm like, woo.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, what's going on?  You know Mary Carey?  Hi, Bill.  She's a huge porn star, though.  Oh, yeah.  She got national attention for running for the... 
[02:50:00]  I'm going to run again, too.  Yeah?  I'm going to win this time.  Of course you are.  Nice.  And you think she's hot.  She lost a lot of weight.  Wow.  She wants someone...  Oh, I moved.  I moved.  Let's do it again.  No, let's do it again.  Do what again?  Take pictures.  She moved.  I moved.  All right.  Bill, she's got a fake vagina.  Mm-hmm.  Is that you breathing really heavy?  Yeah.  I think it's me laughing.  Mary, what was wrong with your teeth in the first place?  Oh, okay.  Well, you wouldn't notice it so much in pictures, but these two are a little shorter. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  And on video, on news shows, they looked funky.  Oh.  So, I kind of was like, one day, I was getting a colonic, and I was like, I hate my teeth.  And on the colonic table, I picked up the phone and was like, it's an emergency.  Wait, that's what you were thinking as getting a colonic?  As I was getting my colonic.  Water being flushed up your ass.  I love colonics.  That's not what I would be thinking.  That's what I was thinking.  I'd be like, holy shit.  I got done with my President Bush dinner, and I was like, new teeth.  Are you looking at my old teeth?  I got the Allegheny going up my head.  Right.  Jeez. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Hold on.  We're going to wrap all this stuff up.  But, all right, why did you go get a colonic, first of all?  I get them all the time.  Tawny got me started on them.  Yeah.  Because I'm extremely toxic, you know, and they clean out.  Everyone's got between 10 to 40 pounds of poop in them, and they rinse out the walls  of your colon, and, like, if you're really toxic, like I am, you've got a lot of toxins  connected to your poop, and so I go to get my toxins flushed out.  It brings your energy down and all that.  Yeah, like, it just, it's like, it feels cleaner. 
[02:51:30]  Like, my friend Jessica, who really does a lot of drugs, hers comes out pitch black,  even, and that's how toxic is.  Really?  Oh, it's like tar?  Yeah, it's like, that's what they said.  See, what's the word on colonics?  I mean, is it, I'm hearing it's like voodoo crap, it's like, they can't really prove that  it does anything.  I mean, I waste a lot of money on those, I hope they work.  Well, a lot of people say that there's tremendous health benefits, and other people say it's  just a crock of shit.  Did you say voodoo and a crock of shit?  That's good.  Are you guys coming to Vegas this year? 
[02:52:00]  Are you guys coming to AVN again?  I don't know if we're going to be back there.  Oh, that was exciting.  I was so high, remember?  We got in a lot of trouble out in Vegas, so I don't know.  You did?  The company might not.  Stephen Gimmy liked it.  Yeah.  I want you guys to come back.  Yeah, we might make it there.  So, walk us through the colonic.  Okay, it's great.  They lube your butt.  They lube your butt.  That's my sign.  They stick a tube in your butt.  How far?  It's like about, maybe like, how many inches is this?  I don't know.  It's like...  About seven?  Is it like in and out? 
[02:52:30]  It's like that big.  Or are they just like inserted?  No, it's like they insert it in, and I had never done anal, so it was my first like anal.  Well, now I have since I've gotten colonics, but my first colonic I hadn't.  Wait, when did you do anal?  With my new boyfriend.  Aw, how cute.  That's so nice.  You had never done anal.  Did you get a card or anything for him?  I always doesn't wait until I was married.  Did he get a card?  No, but I always doesn't wait until I was married, and I met him, and I think we're going to get him.  It's hard to find that one in the Hallmark section.  I know.  Happy anal.  Where's the card for ass sex?  So you've had anal.  I've had anal now three or four times. 
[02:53:00]  I don't want to write greeting cards.  And I swallowed cum for the first time.  Right.  A nice little poem.  Yeah, that's what we've got to think of now.  The poem for the...  What runs with anal.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  You saved your ass for me.  I did.  Well, you know, I want to save some orifice, you know?  Oh, that's so nice.  So I saved it.  Must be a special guy.  He's very special.  Is he a big guy?  He's here.  No, I mean, you know...  Oh, is he big?  Yeah.  It's about, like, nine inches.  He's going to do a porno with me, so you guys will all get to see it soon. 
[02:53:30]  All right, so before you had the ass sex, you...  Had a colonic.  You had a colonic, which was the first thing that was up your poop shoe.  It's about the size of his marker, and they stick a tube in your butt, and then your goal  is to try to hold water in you for a minute, or two minutes, depending on how fast...  Your mission, should you choose to accept it?  Well, no, you most...  We got our TV pitch!  Oh, that's it.  Side of the bus.  Side of the bus.  Can you hold it for a minute?  But you still have the same faces, like, huh? 
[02:54:00]  Huh?  On arts and entertainment.  I smell big, guys.  I smell big.  You're all 20-seconders here.  It's like, the water goes in...  Is that good to be a 20-seconder?  No, you want to be a full 60-second, because...  Do they give you something to hold on to?  Oh, well, there is a hospital, really.  I actually...  I pedal my arms like this.  I go like this.  I imagine that you would be...  You pedal your arm...  They must have, like, colonic bloopers.  They laugh at me, because I'm like...  Like, dumb shit that people do.  My boyfriend, the first day he called me, I was like, give me a colonic. 
[02:54:30]  All right, so I get hosted.  No, well, my boyfriend called me for the first time.  Here's a colonic on bad.  I was like, no one's listening.  No, we're listening.  No, we're listening.  Believe me.  He calls me up, and he goes, like, hey, this is Harold.  I go, hi, I'm getting my ass clean right now.  And that was, like, our introduction.  All right, so the tube is up here.  I got it.  See, that's why we were talking.  Pleased to meet you.  Someone's laughing out there.  Just because we don't laugh doesn't mean somebody doesn't enjoy that.  I know, it hurts my feelings.  Okay. 
[02:55:00]  No one laughs at my shit in this studio, but I get some fan mail every once in a while.  You hold the power of the dick.  Every once in a while.  All right, so it's up your ass.  How much water do they blast into you?  I don't know.  Like, a minute to two minutes, depending on which place you go to.  It's enough to go from your whole colon.  Your colon's, like, a billion inches long.  A billion inches long.  Roughly.  Roughly.  Or about...  Give or take a trillion.  20 feet or something.  Okay, that's it.  I don't know.  Something.  Okay.  And the water goes in, and then they go, are you full?  And you go, yes, I'm full. 
[02:55:30]  And then they push a button, and then it flushes out poop.  And you can watch your poop come out.  That's the fun part.  And they do it for about a half an hour long.  Does it look like that tool video Sober?  Where that little animated guy is pushing that shit through the pipe?  Well, sometimes you see weird things.  I love that.  You've got to last a minute.  Steady.  Steady.  Steady.  Watch them, boys.  You guys all have to get one.  I really like them.  Yeah, well, you've talked it up so much.  Sure.  I can't wait.  I'm going today.  Sounds great.  I mean, I just love them.  I feel a lot healthier. 
[02:56:00]  Did you see anything come out?  I've seen just like corn, you know, the basic stuff.  I mean, I really, I've always liked, do you see, I always want.  Dignity.  I mean, what else came out of them?  Dignity.  I mean, your boyfriend's sperm.  Right.  No, this was before that.  Oh, right.  Well, no, now I still get them with him.  Do you see our tape?  I still get them with him.  All right.  So, now you're just watching stuff come out, right?  Yeah, I just watch your poop come out.  And then it's like.  Maybe you just, you've got to go into the bathroom, right? 
[02:56:30]  No, they like, they like.  It's a glass tube or something.  You're like laying on your side and the tube's next to you.  They made it a spectator.  I have a.  Why?  Well, me and Tony used to watch for each other.  They made it a spectator for brilliant, Anthony.  Why?  In the old days, I'm sure it was just a tube.  You didn't get to see.  Now you get to.  A rubber pipe.  Now you get to see the stuff leaving you.  No, in the old days, they would literally, they would take a reed.  They would insert it in their ass.  I actually saw this right on the internet.  A reed.  A reed.  They would insert it in their ass and they would stand with their back to the river as it rushed. 
[02:57:00]  That's what they would do.  Then you would see salmon coming out.  Right.  You see any old high school rings come out or anything like that?  I don't get it.  Nothing?  No.  She didn't get it.  I got it.  I thought that was very funny.  All right.  Not that it was just one either.  It was high school rings clanging away in the pipe as you watch it go by.  Clink, clink.  Class of 78.  1992 County Champs.  I was born in 1980. 
[02:57:30]  She must have swum up from the Gulf.  This rings from Florida.  Sorry.  This is very serious talk.  So then, do they weigh you before and after?  No.  Because that would be the thing.  Oh, that would be an indicator, wouldn't it?  No, but you know what?  Because, oh, how much poop you lost.  That's a good point.  Yeah, because you said it was like 10 to 40 pounds.  Well, you don't get out that much at once.  It takes like a lot of them to get out that much poop.  A lot of colonics.  Yeah.  And it depends, like, back when I hung out with Tawny and I weighed more, I was eating  so much Taco Bell, I was just getting off the current Taco Bell.  That must have been something. 
[02:58:00]  But like, now they don't.  See a chihuahua go through the tube.  I get that one.  No, but now it's like, and they're more painful if you don't.  Shooting very low.  I just lowered that bar.  If you don't eat as much, it hurts more.  Yeah.  A lot of shit comes out.  I got it.  Hey, shit, though.  You decide to talk on a third grade level for the rest of this hour.  Third.  Third, that's where we started this show.  All right, so.  Now you guys are treating me like Tawny.  I'm ready for your finger painting.  You can hold your own.  I'm not, I'm not.  Okay, come over. 
[02:58:30]  I want to tell you something off the mic.  No, no, I said to her.  No, I said to her.  Okay, take your headphones off and I can't hear you.  She didn't even remember this.  Actually, that was really brilliant on your part.  I know.  I was pretty smart, wasn't I?  Yeah, you were.  And I was drunk, too.  Yeah, I think people thought you were as dumb as she was, but you were actually helping us  with the bit.  I know, but they.  I guess we could tell people that now.  Well, because you guys saw that I knew what I was doing.  I do it to her all the time, actually.  She never gets it half the time and I make fun of her.  All right, so the colonic was nice, but she said colonic teeth were, oh, while you were 
[02:59:00]  getting the colonic, you decided you had to.  Get my teeth done.  That's what we were.  Because I was like sitting there, I got done with all my news shows and I was like, gosh,  I don't like my teeth.  So I picked up my phone and I called the dentist and I was like, it's an emergency, I need new  teeth.  And they scheduled me at 7 a.m. the next day and my boyfriend drove me there and they  drilled them down and put these in.  You called the dentist and you got an appointment the very next day.  Uh-huh.  I told them, because I was going on a radio show a couple weeks later and then they rushed  me in.  I got a radio show to do.  I pulled a whole, like, I have a show on Playboy TV, you got to let me in and they let me in. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I didn't like them.  I was like, then I went crazy until the dentist.  I was going to shoot his brains out because I wasn't used to the big white ones, you know?  Did you show him your tits in the dental chair?  I didn't, but they were like, they were big.  It's like her last talk about sex, too.  I wasn't used to the big white ones.  You had a lot of NBA.  A lot of NBA talk.  No, my boyfriend now, he's white, but he looks like a basketball player because he played  in college.  I did.  And then he got injured.  And then, I'm trying to get him to play overseas, but he doesn't want to. 
[03:00:00]  No.  He thinks there's not enough money.  You want him to go overseas so he can watch the NBA like he used to, right?  No, no, no.  Well, now Tawny's gone because Tawny's got her, like, she has a pimp boyfriend.  A pimp?  How do you date a pimp?  Her boyfriend, she turned him into a pimp.  Basically, she had to hold hooker clients.  She gave him the numbers, and now he books her and her friends, and she, and then the best  It's her key business.  So, she's out of porn?  Yeah.  They ever dropped her, so she's done with porn.  How did you become a pimp?  I just sort of fell into it.  No, he didn't.  You could be a pimp, and it's as easy as just finding a whore. 
[03:00:30]  No, he found the whore.  Take out ads in the paper.  He found the whore, and she had whore friends.  Yeah.  What if someone doesn't treat the whores properly?  Who's going to come down there and do something?  You know, I don't know.  See, I wouldn't be scared of him, because he's kind of like...  You've got to know how to smack down a bitch.  Yeah.  He does.  He smacks her around.  Yeah.  She's got stitches over her head.  The other day, she was locked in her bedroom.  The best was she decided to do a hooker client behind his back.  Uh-oh.  And she ended up falling down in the bathroom in the hooker client's room and cutting her 
[03:01:00]  head open, so he called Ian to know what to do, so the boyfriend had to go get  her, and he was mad that she hooked behind his back.  She's such a great-looking girl.  You could just see her, like, tumbling into really nastiness.  Wow.  That is so bad.  It's crazy.  It's absolutely crazy.  Can't she just find somewhere?  It was basically from Opie and Anthony.  She went downhill.  You know what I mean?  It was like downhill from here.  From here?  From here.  You can't...  This is sea level.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Matt in Illinois.  Matt.  Hey.  How's it going, guys? 
[03:01:30]  Hey.  Hi, Matt.  Got a little poem here I thought I might try to read.  Uh-oh.  I might fit in here.  You notice how much confidence we have in our listeners?  I got a poem.  I'm going to help you guys out with the show, and all we can come up with is...  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Go ahead, Matt.  Car crash ready, right?  You shoved that tube right up your arm.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to give it to him mid-sentence.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  I know it's going to stink.  Go ahead.  All right.  Jerry from Jersey after Matt might have the line of the day, but let's see what Matt has. 
[03:02:00]  Matt's the opening act.  Go ahead, Matt.  You shove that tube right up your ass, push the button, and the water blast.  Poop, toxins, sperm, and corn, all of this, because you're in porn.  I like it.  Yeah, but it's supposed to be like a love thing, you know?  You go to the card store when you need to show Sweetie your lover.  And all we're thinking is there's a lot of girls giving up the ass, and they deserve a card.  So we want to go in business and get these greeting cards out. 
[03:02:30]  Well, we'll have some other people try a poem, okay?  Yeah.  I actually thought I was...  I like that poem, actually.  Yeah, it doesn't matter if we liked it.  The hot piece of ass, I liked it.  So you're in good...  You're all right, Matt.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jerry in New Jersey.  Jerry, go ahead.  Opie, how are you doing?  All right, Jerry.  Good.  I'm hoping that maybe Eric can consider an ass colonic.  It may lead to better breath and a visit to the dentist.  Oh, shit.  You're saying, like, Mary Carey, that Eric should go get a colonic, because then that would make him go to a dentist. 
[03:03:00]  Apparently.  Apparently, it triggers something in the brain where it actually sends you to the dentist, and that may help Eric out quite a bit.  Wait, who's Eric?  He needs one.  Eric is...  You guys are mean to him last time I was here, I think.  Yeah, it's a running thing.  That's who it is.  It's a running thing we do.  It's a running gag.  Aw, Eric.  But we do like him a lot.  That just makes it worse.  Yeah.  And you get trashed by a bunch of guys, and then a girl goes, oh.  I feel bad.  Because it's that, oh, I'll never fuck you, but, oh, I feel sorry for you.  Can you give him a motherly thing?  He deserves it.  Like, just have his hand on your bosoms, and you just go, aw. 
[03:03:30]  My boyfriend's here.  Yeah, but he's not going to lick her.  I have a boyfriend now.  Why is he standing up?  Relax.  We're not doing anything.  Is my boyfriend here?  I don't know.  Where is he?  A white dude just stood up and stared at the studio door.  My boyfriend's not crazy like that.  He's probably not even listening.  He tunes me out a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can see that.  Thanks a lot.  He learns to zone me out.  Really?  What'd you say?  Say what?  Like, shut up.  Our listeners are doing the same thing, coincidentally.  You must just talk all the time, right? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  And about nonsense, though.  What else is on your mind?  I admit it.  I admit it.  Hold on, let's talk about some of the stuff going on in the news.  What's going on?  In the news, want to see how much I know?  Yeah.  There was a hurricane named Katrina, and it demolished New Orleans.  What'd you think of that?  What do I think of that?  I've been in Hurricane Andrew when I was 12, so I actually, I think that, I mean, that  they could not have done anything better than they did, because it takes a natural disaster  for the government to realize how to treat it, you know what I mean? 
[03:04:30]  Like, they weren't prepared.  Now they're going to be prepared always, because they realize they made a mistake.  It takes mistakes like that to realize they're better.  They're going to be over-prepared now.  Actually, good point.  I think Bush did a good job responding.  I think they're beyond prepared, and if the hurricane was hitting a white neighborhood,  they would have responded sooner.  I don't think so.  They would have responded the same if it was, the only difference if it was a really rich  neighborhood, they would have, like, had more connections, so they could have called  people better.  Did the glass tube in the colonic look like a St. Bernard Parish? 
[03:05:00]  It's actually not glass, it's like, the tube is plastic.  Yeah.  Very similar to the levee break.  The levee break, and just muddy water with oil sluice in it.  That's what happens after you hold it for a minute, the levee breaks, and the doctor has  to run out of the way.  Do you guys think the hurricane was homeless evacuating?  Homeless people floating down inside.  Yeah, do they have, like, a little, do they have a little kiddie pool when you're ready  to let it go?  I don't know, it goes into this big contraption, and I don't know where it goes.  Contraption, you're with your technical medical jargon. 
[03:05:30]  A contraption.  Okay, you guys, the colon is, like, billions of feet long, and I insert this tube.  Contraption.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Missouri, he's got a greeting card for Mary.  You guys.  Hey, Mary, what's going on?  I have a, that's funny, sorry.  You like Bill Burr?  He's a funny guy, right?  Yeah.  I miss Jimmy, but I like Bill.  Well, Jimmy's in LA.  He's too cool, isn't he?  No, he's in LA doing an HBO series. 
[03:06:00]  He's a big TV star.  He's becoming a huge star in front of our eyes.  That's the consensus, and that could have worked out better for us.  From hosting the ABN show to Opie and Anthony at HBO.  Miss Jimmy, I like Bill.  Like Bill.  Perfect.  Bill, I like you.  Exactly what we were hoping for.  People miss Jimmy, like Bill.  That's all we wanted.  All we wanted.  Alright.  Miss Jimmy, hate Bill, would have sucked.  Don't miss Jimmy, love Bill, would have sucked too.  Have a lunatic on our hands trying to kill us and try to kill Bill.  Kill Bill.  Kill Bill.  I want to spit in your face. 
[03:06:30]  I want to spit in your fucking face.  Jeff, Missouri, go ahead.  Hey, a greeting card should say, I really think that you are super.  Would you stick it in my pooper?  Oh, that's like the pre-card.  The pre-card.  Like to try to soften the beaches.  I kind of like it.  Soften the beaches.  Soften up the beaches.  That would make you feel special, wouldn't it?  Alright, that's good.  I like that.  But I think we're thinking of the greeting card you'd have to get after the fact.  You know, I hear when women give birth, they get a nice little, what is it called, 
[03:07:00]  a tennis bracelet?  Yeah.  That's the thing to do?  Uh huh.  Like a nice guy, you're supposed to go out and get her something for giving birth to  your child.  That's right.  There has to be something that you could give the ladies after they give up the ass.  When they're crying in the fetal position.  Like, thanks for...  You know, I didn't cry.  It hurts to poop the next day, though, after you take it in the butt, man.  It hurts to poop.  In the shower, in the fetal position.  What did I do?  I can't even talk to my parents.  I'm sorry, Daddy.  You know, a lot of girls in porn, I met, give it up in the butt first because they want 
[03:07:30]  to save their vaginas for the virgins longer.  I met a girl who did it.  They're called ladies.  Excuse me.  They're called technical virgins.  Yeah.  Where's our technical virgins commercials?  We have some.  Hey, we got more greeting cards coming in.  Now they're coming to the table.  Let's say hi to Sean in Florida.  Sean?  How you doing?  I've got a card for y'all.  Alright.  The sex has been so banal, I'm glad you gave up the anal.  I'm just going to rhyme anal with banal, but I didn't know what banal meant. 
[03:08:00]  Banal.  What does that mean?  Does that mean boring?  You kind of know what's coming, though, when you use a word like that.  Yeah.  It's got to be one of those things where you're going to guess that it could be three or four  different words.  Right.  When you say banal, it's like banal.  Duh.  I just picked up a sock.  Now I want some cock.  There you go, Mary.  I got it.  Third grade level.  Jesus.  Let's go to Pennsylvania.  Help us out.  Hey, it doesn't mean that you're a slut because you let me screw your butt. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, I like that.  Hold on.  He had a second verse.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  He had a second verse.  Mary talks too much.  Alright.  Go ahead.  Start over.  It doesn't mean that you're a slut because you let me screw your butt.  It shows that you have got real class to let me fuck you in the ass.  Oh, I like that.  Class ass.  The independent who was coming, if I could just pick it apart a little bit.  Alright.  Punch it out.  No, that wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  It had enough to fill up the inside of a card. 
[03:09:00]  It did.  Four lines.  I liked it.  What kind of picture on the front of the card?  I don't want one of the fun ones, though.  Oh, that's...  Like the pop-up ones.  You open it, a big ass pops up in your face.  Yeah.  You know, by some wacky way, they move the paper and it pops up.  It all depends on what her reaction is.  If she really didn't enjoy it, you just got to have you kind of shrugging your shoulders.  It should pop up as a gaping hole, though, not like a little bite.  Yeah, the guy just kind of shrugging his shoulders.  Ah!  I thought you'd like it.  Sorry to hear about your anal sex.  Anal sex.  The front of my card, I would get a really good artist to make a heart, but if you look 
[03:09:30]  really close, it's actually an asshole.  It's an asshole.  That's cute, too.  I would like one of those.  My boyfriend didn't give me one.  But it's one of those trick cards, you have to look a little closer.  Yeah, a little closer.  Oh, my God.  Optical illusion.  Wait.  The stairs keep going?  Is it two people looking face-to-face or a vase?  Or the Truman Show poster where it's a bunch of little pictures, but you stand back  and looks like a big one.  And it's the big picture.  It's a bunch of... 
[03:10:00]  Stand back, it's a heart.  You go close, it's a bunch of little assholes.  Little assholes making up the bigger picture.  Mary, you really started a bit here.  Let's go to Ron in Pennsylvania.  I love that.  Go ahead, Ron.  Yes, I got a poem for you.  All right.  Last night was great and you were cool.  Thank you for letting me push in your stool.  Hey, Jay.  That's really cool.  The old push in your stool gag.  I didn't know where that was going at first.  Very good.  Hey.  Let's go to J.D.  J.D.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  You get that picture on the front of your car that you're talking about and then it opens 
[03:10:30]  it up and you simply put it in there.  Thanks for letting me fuck you in the ass.  You just hear like...  I love when they get mad.  Phone hang up.  Fuck you.  I tried.  You and your fucking show.  Fuck the fuck listen anymore.  He changes the station because it just reminds him of how embarrassed he is.  Fuck this XM shit.  He's pulling out wires right now.  Fucking roadie 2 is going out his window.  I'm back to that stupid local station called the Fox.  Fuck these assholes. 
[03:11:00]  Close up on the roadie 2 laying on the line of the highway and the truck tire running it  over.  You know they got like five or six different copies that they've crumpled up like, no,  this is the gem.  Yeah.  I got it now.  So cute.  Fucking assholes.  Fucking guys.  Fuck you anyway.  I knew there was a reason why I hated them.  Fred in Ohio.  What's up?  Hey, I got one for you.  Alright.  You got looped up and watched Korn pass and came straight home with some squeaky clean  ass. 
[03:11:30]  That bad, huh?  No, I like it.  We gotta end up on an up note here.  John on Long Island.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, John.  Here's my little card.  I love you, honey, for giving up the back door and letting me fuck you like a whore.  Oh, I like that.  A little anger, but yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's gotta be sweet.  Yeah, yeah.  He's trying to make it feel better.  Because the act itself is horrific, so you want to tie it together with a sweet card.  That's the gag here. 
[03:12:00]  You gotta get the point.  Dice.  Hey, hickory dickory dock, Mary was sucking my cock.  Sorry, I put it out.  Punching out.  Did you hear his voice quivered on cock when he lost all his confidence?  No confidence left.  Hickory dick.  He punches out while his family is accepting the folded flag.  Caskets going into the ground.  Punch it out.  No, you're not.  Jets are already floating over. 
[03:12:30]  I love all of you.  I love you.  Missing man formation.  Punch it out.  No, you're not.  You're not.  All right, let's say hi to Jason in Green Bay.  Jason.  Hey, you gotta make it short and sweet.  The birthday card goes like this.  My birthday would be merry if I bust your asshole cherry.  Aw, that's cute.  Thank you.  A little holiday.  Christmasy.  Yeah.  I like it out.  All right, let's go to Justin on Long Island.  Justin.  Boys, what's going on? 
[03:13:00]  Hey.  Billy, I got a question for you.  Bill.  You need to set him up.  Bill.  Yes.  Now it's shit now.  You want to go to the colonic store and get a colonic for your asshole?  It's like a billion feet long.  All right, now he's listening to us.  Okay, well, we're going to take a break.  I just never trust him.  Huh?  I never trust him.  No, and you shouldn't. 
[03:13:30]  Hey, Bill.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Bill?  Bill?  Yeah, I'm not going to help you.  Yeah, click.  You got some motherfuckers, you hear it?  Now you're a cunt.  All right, in honor of this discussion, we'll go old school with Stephen Lynch and play  gerbil.  Do we have to really honor the discussion?  Yeah, why not?  No, that discussion was still, we need to honor it with a statue and song.  It's going to be one of our accomplishments.  We're going to have a poster in the studio of one of our accomplishments. 
[03:14:00]  Of course we will.  Correct.  More with Mary Carey in just a bit.  And I think Mick Foley's going to join the program.  He was supposed to be here about a half hour ago.  Wow, man.  That's impressive.  I'm not even joking.  Mick Foley is like a god.  Of course.  Cactus Jack.  What does he do?  He gave up his ear.  Mankind.  Yep.  The old wrestler.  He's not old, buddy.  Ever watch wrestling WWF?  Meaning old because he's not doing it anymore, but he's now an author.  Wow.  And doing very, very well. 
[03:14:30]  I'm excited.  He's another old friend stopping by for the first time since we've been back on radio.  I like basketball players, only they're all not fucking you.  He had his ear torn off in a match.  No way.  Mike Tyson murder.  You actually read his book.  I read that.  Yeah.  Wasn't it great?  Yeah.  I read that on vacation.  Now I want to read it.  His autobiography is really, really good.  Slow down, Mary.  Yeah.  I'm going to read John Jameson's book first and then I'll read his next book.  Yeah?  How about you start with green eggs and ham?  Nothing.  Alright.  Okay. 
[03:15:00]  Now you're treating me like Tawny again.  We just gave you that.  Alright.  Don't treat me like Tawny.  Alright.  I keep forgetting.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  When you're right, you're right.  Stephen Lynch, Gerbil.  The Petting Zoo.  If Richard Gere can do it, I can too.  I get undressed.  I start to lube.  I stick the gerbil in the end of the tube.  Wondering just how he'll feel.  Will he like it better than his little wheel? 
[03:15:30]  Careful now, he's right beside me.  One more inch and he's inside me.  Go, Gerbil, go.  Burrow harder, burrow deeper.  Be my little chimney sweeper.  One thing I forgot about. 
[03:16:00]  How am I supposed to get you out?  So now my gerbil's on easy street.  It's warm and cozy and there's plenty to eat.  The situation is beyond my control.  Gotta find a way to get him out of his hole.  I try crowbars, I try wires. 
[03:16:30]  I almost hurt him with a pair of pliers.  I try cheese, but he's not biting.  I wish this wasn't so exciting.  Go, Gerbil, go.  Jesus, I am such a sucker.  Please get out, you furry.  I think I am getting ill. 
[03:17:00]  Suddenly, he's very, very still.  Now it's too late, my gerbil died.  I guess I have committed gerbicide.  Here's some advice, it's very clear cut.  If you love your gerbil, don't stick him up your butt. 
[03:17:30]  Don't stick him up your butt.  Little fairy gerbil in your booty hole.  All right.  Wow.  The gerbil song.  Ranking news across the XM nation.  XM now has five million subscribers.  This is Larry King.  Congratulations, XM, on your latest headline.  Hey, Sean Hannity here congratulating XM's satellite radio on five million subscribers. 
[03:18:00]  Hey, this is Robert Kelly.  XM, I want to say congratulations on five million subscribers.  That's a lot of fucking subscribers.  It's Ripple Nou Wednesday, it's Ripple Nou Wednesday, it's Ripple Nou Wednesday.  It's Ripple Nou Wednesday, it's Ripple Nou Wednesday.

[03:19:00]  Stay out the bushes!  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday!  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday!  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday!  Coopie and Anthony, XM202.  I love doing this radio show with my pals. 
[03:19:30]  Every day it's different.  Today in studio, Bill Burr doing another great job for us.  BillBurr.com, and you're going to be in Sacramento a week from what, Thursday?  Oh my god, I'm in Sacramento next week!  I'm in Sacramento next week.  Yeah!  Oh my god, I am too.  That's fucking...  Oh my god, you should come to my strip club appearance, I'll come see your comedy.  Wait, wait, not this weekend.  Next week, the 4th through the 9th, I'm in Sacramento.  You just go around the cities and strip.  Yeah, well they pay me, I do shows, I just get arrested and get off on it.  Dude, you gotta go to her thing, she'll go to your thing, and then you guys call the show,  we'll have a nice little thing. 
[03:20:00]  No, totally come see me.  Bill, where are you going to be?  That'll kill 8 minutes.  Where are you going to be in Sacramento?  The punchline.  Punchline is, what dates?  A week from tomorrow?  A week from today, Wednesday.  You're going Wednesday through Saturday?  On Tuesday, Saturday.  Wednesday through Sunday.  Wednesday through Sunday in Sacramento.  You're just awesome.  A week from today, it starts, Bill Burr in Sacramento.  And Mary Carey, who is a porn star, she'll be dancing where?  Gold Club Centerfold.  How great is it?  Actually, I have all the info.  I usually don't, I'm real bad about putting info.  I got it up on MySpace, and I have it up on BillBurr.com. 
[03:20:30]  BillBurr.com.  How funny would that be is if the comedy people went to the strip club and vice versa,  because they get all the plugs.  We should do that.  If you get in Tuesday, because you can come see me Tuesday night.  Is that what you're off Tuesday night, right?  I think I fly in on Wednesday.  Oh.  Well, you can come see me.  My lash is like 2 in the morning.  Mary, they're lowering the blinds.  So I can show my boobs?  That means you're in deep trouble.  Oh.  And we got to say hi, of course, to an old friend, McFoley.  McFoley.  Yes.  Are you really not allowed to show your boobs in public? 
[03:21:00]  No.  I mean here.  In the workplace, they call it.  We don't really get it, because usually when you have to lower blinds and stuff, that  means there's women in the work environment.  But it's all guys, and we still have to do that.  So make your own conclusions of what the hell is going on here.  How unfair is this to make my return to O&A after a lengthy absence, and I've got to  try to compete with Mary.  Oh, no.  I'll be quiet now.  Can I say-  It's not the being quiet.  I'm worried about flashing the, you know.  I've got to say something that's going to be boring, but it has to be said. 
[03:21:30]  When Anthony and I got kicked off commercial radio, speaking for myself, I really found  out who my real friends were.  A lot, you know, we get to meet a lot of people doing this radio show.  And most people, you know, they blew us off.  You know, it's just the nature of the beast.  But this guy tried to hunt us down on more than a few occasions to make sure we were okay,  and that we were going to be all right in the end.  Yeah, that was really cool.  And I just want to acknowledge that to everyone in the room and to our fans listening.  This guy is a stand-up guy, man.  I'm glad the messages got through to you.  It was kind of self-serving, though, I've got to tell you. 
[03:22:00]  The third most depressed person when you guys were kicked off the air was me.  Not the two of you, because I had a novel coming out a couple years ago.  And I'll tell you what, the feedback I used to get from being on this show was so positive.  I mean, I'd be driving down the road and some guy would roll down the window or push a button and the window would go down.  And they'd go, love you on O&A, man.  Love you on O&A.  And I've got to be honest, I never heard that from Howard, you know, back, because I used to do his show, too.  And they were like, you and Howard, yeah, but it was always O&A.  So when it came to promoting the novel, I was just going to say, look, just find out what markets O&A are on, and I'll go there. 
[03:22:30]  You guys are going to be my one-stop shopping.  Yeah, oops.  The other cool thing, you know, obviously he was huge in the wrestling world and decided to kind of pretty much retire at the time.  Yeah.  And you wanted to give writing full-time a shot.  Your autobiography was absolutely huge, okay?  But now you wanted to write fake stories, basically, okay?  Yeah.  And I was on the train with him, Long Island Railroad, as he's coming into the city to pitch the first book after your autobiography. 
[03:23:00]  Right, right.  What was it called again?  Tietum Brown.  And I got to admit, I'm thinking, wow, what are the chances that you would actually be a successful writer?  I'm thinking of myself, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  But I was like all for it, and it sounded great and all, and we're riding the train together, and he's getting recognized like crazy.  And there's just McFoley on the stupid, you know, train going into the city hoping that he could get his second career launch.  Turned out the book came out.  It was definitely a success, and now you've got another one.  Yeah, that's right.  And there's a little thing in there you might be able to relate to being on, can I tell you? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, go.  You know where you went to school?  The Harborfields guy, right?  Right.  And this was one of the seeds that became this story was the Ward Melville-Sachem post-basketball brawl of 1980.  My dad was the Ward Melville athletic director.  He had a reputation that, you know, he was gruff but lovable, but if you didn't know him, that whole lovable thing didn't really apply.  And I remember flying down Jericho Turnpike while my dad was going to try to single-handedly break up this brawl. 
[03:24:00]  And so, in my story, it's Lloyd Milton in Lake Grove, you know, because I'm not exactly kind to either school in there.  But I thought you'd be able to dig that.  It's set in the Bronx for the first eight years of the story.  And, you know, I did a lot of research.  Because after 9-11, I realized, man, I'm a Long Island guy.  I'm 50 miles but like a world away from New York.  And I really came to appreciate the culture and the heritage until today when I was stuck in three hours of traffic.  And I'm driving down and thinking, now I know I hate this place.  I can't stay in this city. 
[03:24:30]  There was a time we all loved New York again, but now we're all back to hating this fucking hole.  You can get to major cities in this country.  There are some major cities you can get to if you live 500 miles away.  Faster than you can get to New York City if you live 30 miles away.  I made it quicker to Washington from Queens.  I was going for a Mets game.  I went down there a couple of weeks ago to promote the book.  Did I just get a cheap book plug in there?  Broding Scooter.  Scooter.  Mick Foley's latest novel.  And I made that quicker than I did the Long Island to New York 50 mile trip. 
[03:25:00]  Nothing worse than doing that.  The trip from Boston to New York on Long Island.  I go, Boston to Long Island.  You make the trip and you're like, man, look at the time I'm making.  I'm flying down 95.  I'm making great time.  And then you just dead stop.  You spend as much time going 10 miles as the whole trip.  Yeah.  And from my perspective, you can't think of any cool wrestling interviews or any novel plot lines,  any kind of twisted sex scene when you're hitting a break every five times. 
[03:25:30]  And you're just freaking out because this idiot's got like three car lengths in front of him.  The guy in front of you.  Yep.  Get on his bumper.  You see somebody change lanes and get in front of you.  Now I'm one car further from home.  Thanks, ass.  You know what's even worse?  I'll be finishing a gig and I'm like, I'm not going to, I'm going to fucking leave right after the gig.  I'm going to be driving at three in the morning.  There'll be no traffic.  And then all the state workers close off all but one lane.  And just create five o'clock traffic at fucking four in the morning.  At four in the morning.  Losing your shit. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, you're dealing with just brake lights.  Can I go to the phone real fast?  I'm being called out on something.  Nate, Brooklyn, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Yeah, Ope, I just thought you should know that when you're talking to an author,  fake stories are also known as fiction.  Over and out, guys.  I gotta be honest, that whole fiction, non-fiction thing has fucked me up my whole life.  I always gotta take five seconds to be kidding.  You always are thinking, wait, non-fiction has to be fake stories because it's non-stories.  No, but it's real stories. 
[03:26:30]  It should just be fake stories, not fake stories.  Here's the difference.  Mick, your book of lies is fantastic.  That's all it is, is lying on paper.  And when you do dialogue, you become almost like schizophrenic guys.  You have to go back and forth from a couple different characters.  My next book, I'm actually gonna write first person narrative where I'm gonna be a black  woman growing up in the segregated fifties.  Wow.  And so I'm gonna have to get into that zone where I'm gonna have to feel like a black woman.  That's probably gonna make him snap.  He's gonna be throwing the tennis ball against the wall. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  But I went from telling real stories about a fake world.  Which would be non-fiction.  Which would be non-fiction.  Okay.  To telling fake stories about a real world.  So this is set, like, this book's set in the very real world of the Bronx in the 60s.  And there are some real characters.  You know, Joe DiMaggio plays a little role.  Like Joe Torre.  Unfortunately, I learned, if you want the Yankees to get behind a book about a kid growing up  in the Bronx, then you probably shouldn't include Joe Torre, a younger Joe Torre, as 
[03:27:30]  the kid's go-to guy when he's trying to make his first sexual experience last a little  bit longer.  Oh.  Like, what I think is funny, you know, Joe Torre as the, you know, the guy.  Remember the movie Torre, Torre, Torre, you know, in the 70s?  Well, the kid's actually, like, thinking of that, but he's going, Torre, Torre, Torre,  to try to get that one moment to last a little bit longer.  Because guys like us, Mary, need that type of inspiration.  That's right.  And you said you had some kind of porn book story?  That's a cute little thing.  I'm just proud of myself, because a couple of years ago, if I'd had someone like Mary 
[03:28:00]  Carey looking at me and flashing her ripe melons, I probably wouldn't be able to string  a sentence together, but I'm doing okay, right?  You're doing great.  You've been great.  I'm trying not to look too often over there.  Now I'm going to get that.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  My goodness.  I like his style.  He plays the shy gentleman.  That's me.  I don't know.  He's a father.  I haven't let one F-bomb drop.  Of your father.  I forgot you could do that.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to resist.  I try to keep those.  I try to use them sparingly and as a powerful verb once in a while in the Foley bedroom,  if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  Do you still celebrate Christmas all year?  All year round.  I've got the Christmas room.  You read that in his autobiography, right?  Oh, that sounds like fun.  I love Christmas.  He has a Christmas room in his house.  I want to come.  Can I come over?  What's in the Christmas room?  I'll have to check.  You know what?  It's somewhat overrated.  It's a bunch of Anna Lee.  I could call them dolls, but I'll call them mobility figures. 
[03:29:00]  But they're these kind of unique handmade dolls.  They used to be handmade in Meredith, New Hampshire, and now they're handmade in China because  it's apparently cheaper to do the painting over there.  But they're these cool things and I've got Christmas artwork up there and pictures of  me with Santa when I was a kid and a big framed photo of my kids with Santa and some  artwork people have done, Santa artwork.  You got lights in there?  Yeah, a little light, some things.  What I might do, and I just heard through the grapevine, Dee Snider got a hold of me and  says, yo, Mick, MTV Cribs was over here. 
[03:29:30]  And when I told them they knew you, you know, they thought that'd be cool.  Now, my house, I've got to tell you, Mary, I have a nice house.  But once you walk in, like the whole illusion is over because I've got kids everywhere.  We have a dog that pees on the rugs.  We had to pull all the rugs up.  My dog pees everywhere, too.  It's like the barren, you know, desolate place in there.  So I may have to, like, rent some stuff if MTV Cribs comes over just so it looks like  I've got cool things. 
[03:30:00]  It looks like you've been to the furniture store.  Exactly.  Maybe rent out some Christmas stuff.  But quick porno slash literature.  I like it.  All right.  I come home and I see something special in my mailbox and I said to my wife, guess who  wrote to me again?  And she said, Christy Canyon.  I love Christy.  Isn't she great?  Yeah.  I've got a cool, like, rambling message from Christy on my machine.  I haven't taken it off.  It's like eight minutes long.  She has the XM radio show for Playboy.  Can we play it on our show?  Yeah.  I guess so. 
[03:30:30]  She doesn't say anything bad.  Yeah.  Give her a buzz, but it's early over there.  But I said, back to the correspondents.  Go ahead.  I said, guess who I got a letter from?  She said, Christy Canyon.  And I said, no, John Irving.  John Irving is one of our most beloved literary authors.  So the only two people I officially have as pen pals who are famous are John Irving,  winner of the National Book Award and Academy Award, and Christy Canyon.  I love Christy.  I just met her, like, a couple months ago.  I have not met her, but we were trying to... 
[03:31:00]  Your pen pals, though?  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm going to give a plug for a book other than mine.  That's unusual, but I...  She loves plugs.  I read...  I read her autobiography.  I was hoping the comedian would laugh at that line, not the porn star, by the way.  It was Bill, too.  I was hoping that Bill would acknowledge that I might be funny and not getting a laugh from.  What do you think?  That really sucked, because I look at Bill like, see, I got material.  Ah?  You gave me nothing.  I was giving you the...  Ah?  Nothing from you, and then she's laughing like a little spooky. 
[03:31:30]  Well, I love anal plugs, so...  I stink.  All right.  Go ahead.  People are still pen pals.  No, they still exist.  It doesn't happen.  It's not an email thing.  Did I give you her number?  Well, do you still have her number?  I've got the number.  I co-hosted her.  She has XM Radio.  Right.  Her Playboy, I co-hosted with her.  They're on hiatus now, though, right?  Yeah, they're on hiatus until January.  That's what she got around to telling me during that seven-minute message.  Well, anyway...  The authors pen pal each other, though.  You just got a picture.  It's with a quill and the thing. 
[03:32:00]  My friend, I hope life is finding you in a place that is wonderfully...  Like, not just, hey, dude.  Like, all of my letters start, hey, dude!  You know?  Hey, man.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  Pen pal.  The worst.  I'm under a lot of pressure.  When I was writing to Irving, it's like, oh, no, I don't have an editor here with me  to clean up my grammar.  You have to.  Your grammar.  And I'm reusing language that I'd never use in day-to-day life.  Is it T-H-I-E-R or is it T-H-E-R-E? 
[03:32:30]  Fuck!  Did you start every new page with the big, extra-large-sized letter?  Huge letter.  With the curly Q things around it.  No, but after writing to Irving on just, you know...  A stupid quant.  On just basic white paper.  It's so loopy-looped.  You don't even know what letter it is anymore.  Very truly yours.  Sir.  Fully.  Sir Nicholas.  Sir.  My travels have brought me, too.  You'll be an Anthony program.  I said something because he had mentioned he didn't have a chance to read my book. 
[03:33:00]  If you look at the back of the book, some authors, I just blindly sent them out, you  know, and my editor said, I read your letters, they're very charming, but don't expect any  kind of, you know, any type of answer.  And I got a call from Richard Price, the guy who did Clockers, which turned into a Spike  Lee movie, and The Wanderers, you might remember.  Sure.  And he gave me this amazing quote on the back of the book that's far more literary than  any of the writing in the actual book, you know.  And he also said, I'd like to get together with you sometime and trade stories.  I said, oh, okay, trade stories about what? 
[03:33:30]  He said, about growing up in the Bronx.  And I said, oh, I didn't grow up in the Bronx.  And he said, you didn't?  Now, here's a guy, he didn't win the National Book Award like Irving, but he was nominated,  and nominated for an Oscar.  And I said, man, that's high praise coming from you.  Can I tell you something?  I just read the Richard Price quote that's on the back of Scooter, the new novel by Mick  Foley.  While you're reading this, can I do this?  Can I look at Mary?  Because she's going to be impressed by my intellect.  My brain just exploded trying to figure out what he's trying to say. 
[03:34:00]  I don't know what it means either, but it sounds great.  It turns Ashcan realist and operatic, lurid, and heartfelt, sentimental, and hard-nosed.  Scooter is an absorbing tale of one kid's growth into young manhood via sports.  Sports as an instrument of love, of revenge, of celebration, and of destruction.  It also, most compellingly, offers an athlete's contemplation of pain and the unique brand  of salvation that can come of its forbearance. 
[03:34:30]  Richard Price.  Holy shit.  But I've got to tell you, while you're reading that quote, this should be one of my finest  literary moments.  You're reading this quote on the air, and I'm just staring at Mary's breast.  Can't take my eyes off.  I kind of like your author photo that comes with the book.  The rugged Irish poet.  That is nice.  Wow, you really do look like a public guy.  It's like a cold day.  He's got his jacket on the winds blowing.  Wasn't this the photographer?  I had a great idea.  I love that.  In the name of the father headshot. 
[03:35:00]  It looks like it, doesn't it?  Did he have a fan blowing the hair?  No, no.  It was January we took the shot, and the photographer, this same woman, she took my last shot when  I had the real short hair.  And when I asked, hey, can I use one of those shots when I do these college speaking gigs?  I do like 10 a year.  And I needed a headshot.  And she goes, oh, of course you can, $1,500.  I went, what?  So I went down to my local place for $25 and got the 12 shot.  And I honestly couldn't tell the difference. 
[03:35:30]  But she's very highly respected.  She said, I had an idea.  I said, okay, what is it?  She goes, why don't we go to the Bronx and we'll take that picture in front of Yankee Stadium.  And after I agreed to it, I started thinking, it's a headshot.  Opie, can we tell that I'm in front of Yankee Stadium?  I was going to say, you could have probably just stayed in your backyard there, Mick.  I have no idea where you are.  Oh, my God.  I can tell it's cold and the wind is blowing.  I swear to you, I thought you were in the woods.  I thought I saw a lighthouse in the backyard. 
[03:36:00]  Most of the pictures were nullified right away because of the mucus in the nose.  It was a little nipply out there, as we like to say.  Oh, let me tell you the Christy Canyon story.  Oh, yeah.  I love her.  Have you read her autobiography?  I didn't even know she had one.  Lights, camera, sex.  She wrote it herself.  Wow.  Is it like, what, third grade level?  Like they don't know?  No, no.  She wrote it with crayons.  So I wrote her back.  Somebody gave me the book.  I wrote her back as an author.  Yeah.  Kind of tell her that I think you did a very nice job. 
[03:36:30]  And I said, and it read, not so much as a sex story, but as a coming of age story  with some action and adventure that just happened to involve a lot of graphic sex.  Yeah.  And I said, I'm looking at your breasts.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I'm going to cover them up.  Yeah, cover them up.  Oh, no.  I said, you know, an author uses words much in the same way that an artist uses paint  to illustrate characters.  And I said, and I thought your words did a very nice job of giving vivid illustrations 
[03:37:00]  of such people as Tracy Lords and Ginger Lynn and all that.  And I wrote this nice little letter.  So she got back.  And now there's a great story in there.  Why didn't you guys ever use email?  It's two things I don't know how to do, Mary.  Email.  Two things I can't turn on, a computer and a woman.  Oh.  You can turn me on though, so.  Wow.  That's just awful.  Well, the phones, a lot of people have questions for Mick Foley, mankind. 
[03:37:30]  What are you, just clackity-clacking a typewriter when you...  Just rather freehand.  Freehand, you're right.  Yeah, it's like, have a nice day with 760 pages of notebook paper.  This is probably about...  And someone had to, like, figure out what you were...  Yeah.  Wow.  The deciphering process is tough.  Tim the trucker.  Yeah, hey, I got two quick questions.  Mick Foley, love you, man.  Mick Foley, love you, man.  Thank you.  Hey, I want to ask you...  He means that in a rugged way. 
[03:38:00]  On your book for truckers, can you get, like, make your books for, like, on tape?  You know what?  So we can listen to them?  Yeah, the two of them are.  Have a nice day is on tape, and my first novel is Teetum Brown.  Excuse me, I won't do this one because there are a lot of accents involved, and I get foolish  when I start playing around with accents.  You did the book on tape for your autobiography?  Yeah, yeah.  How long did it take to...  Oh, wow.  ...maybe 760 pages? 
[03:38:30]  They abridged that thing, but I'll tell you what, it's no easy job when you go in there  and try to polish it off in a day, but you have to start over.  Anytime you mess up a word, you have to start that sentence or that paragraph over, so you're  in there for it.  You have to do the whole book in one day?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I think I may have had two days with that one.  That was a long one, but I know I did the novel in one day.  And so, chapter one, you're really starting off full of vim and vigor, and by the time  you're done, you're like, it was a windy day.  Oh.  You have to read your whole book?  Yeah, you read that whole thing, man.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  You're all monotone. 
[03:39:00]  You start it off with, once upon a time, out in the forest there was a rabbit, and a  wee little owl.  By the end of it, yeah, and then the fucking bear fell down.  I don't know what the fuck happened.  There's going to be another one.  You decipher this.  Read it to yourself.  Hey, we've got to ask you some wrestling stuff, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you coming back?  Yes.  Homecoming.  This is WWE's big return to-  Can I walk you to the ring?  He's like, no.  Wow, that's not a bad idea, huh?  That's quite an offer, man.  You know, I've got to be honest, Mary. 
[03:39:30]  I'm a good ballet.  The whole beautiful woman on my arm thing really has never worked with my character,  but I could pass that by Vince.  I could show him some of your previous work.  I've got some new pictures.  Okay, I'll pass along some nudies.  At least get an interview.  And we'll see what we can do.  But that's a wonderful offer.  We can practice walking together.  I could be like the patriotic.  Are you patriotic?  I don't know.  Fairly patriotic, yeah.  I'm patriotic, so.  I could wear a USA bikini a lot.  He lost his ear. 
[03:40:00]  You're awesome, yeah.  Do you have a new replacement?  No, you like that, don't you?  I want to see the new ear.  Yeah, she's got new teeth.  Let me see.  Nice, nice.  Yeah, I'll show you.  I usually don't, but this is radio.  So I'm going to start with the good one over here.  Oh, wow.  Perfect ear.  That's a nice ear.  Perfect.  I've never seen this myself.  Holy crap.  The whole thing was torn off.  How was it torn off?  Bizarre gardening, actually.  A little weed whacker.  No, I was in a match with a guy named Vader in 93, an international incident in Munich. 
[03:40:30]  I was doing a move, Mary.  It was very dangerous, but I could pull it off because I had the strength and courage  of ten men, and I got my head.  Wow.  I might as well lie.  She doesn't know.  Sure.  I was 13 in 93, so.  Okay.  Well, you were 13, so you can imagine the pain I was in.  As I thought, I felt the blood supply, my carotid artery being clamped off, much in  the same way that a sleeper hold would do.  Oh.  And much like a bear who chews off its paw, or a fox, you got me on that bear thing. 
[03:41:00]  The fox who chews off its paw, which gave me a trap, I pulled out of the ropes, and  my ear didn't come with me.  Oh, my gosh.  He's right there.  I could have used some comforting that night, for sure.  He's the real deal.  I'll comfort you.  If I walk you to the ring, I'll comfort you afterwards.  He is the real deal, I'm telling you.  So, really fast, because we're running out of show.  Yes.  We only got like a minute and a half left.  The wrestling thing.  The wrestling thing.  Homecoming.  USA Network.  That's the reason why most so many fans started tuning in when we were on USA.  Returns at 8 o'clock. 
[03:41:30]  I'll be returning along with Stone Cold, Steve Austin, Triple H, and the immortal Hulk Hogan.  I want to start watching again.  I've got to be honest.  This would be a good one to do.  I'm doing Piper's Pit.  It's been a lull.  It's been a lull for about three years for us.  Been a little lull since I've been gone, but things are about to pick up.  That's very good.  And the new book is Scooter by Mick Foley.  If you like your coming of age stories, sensitive yet violent.  And right on the cover it says, a novel.  I like Mick Foley.  A fake story.  Fake stories.  A made up lie by Mick Foley. 
[03:42:00]  And I guess I spelled there wrong and none of you guys picked up on the T-H-I-E-R thing.  Hey, Big Kev brought in my Talking Scarface doll, action figure doll.  Listen to me.  Action figure, Talking Scarface from SideshowToys.com.  Thank you.  Very much.  It talks.  It curses.  Mary?  My website.  MaryCarrie.com.  And you're going to be in Sacramento.  Oh yeah, Sacramento next week.  The Gold Club in Sacramento.  A week from today. 
[03:42:30]  It's all on my website.  MaryCarrie.com.  I watched Playboy TV.  It's totally busted.  What the hell?  What strip holes?  Oh, I shot the Playboy Book of Lingerie.  Girls with Playboy TV.  It's coming out soon.  All right, very good.  Mick Foley, it's always a pleasure.  You're going to have to go back when you can spend more time.  Definitely.  Deadline Radio.  We do much longer breaks.  We never do commercials.  We can just hang and...  I feel ashamed that I was late.  And we can have sex on air.  Ah, yeah.  Well, that happens.  Whipple ball back.  How do you bomb with that?  It's unbelievable.  That's something.  That's it.  I'm out of here. 
[03:43:00]  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
