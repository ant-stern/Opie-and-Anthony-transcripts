<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show "Worst of 2013" broadcast, hosted by E-Rock, was a chaotic and highly irreverent affair.  The show opened with a rambling introduction referencing past segments and personalities before diving into a bizarre mix of content.  Scott Thorson, Liberace's former boyfriend, recounted his relationship with Liberace, made allegations of sexual encounters with Michael Jackson, and discussed his involvement in the Wonderland murders.  A Sopranos impersonator, Max Koch, called in with a profane and surreal tribute to the late James Gandolfini.

The show featured a montage of WWE moments with Fandango, CM Punk, The Miz, and Heather B from *The Real World*.  Jim Norton's writing and a potential reality TV show were discussed. A surprise appearance by Fandango resulted in the hosts lotioning him up, followed by his abrupt departure after his name was mispronounced.  A brief interview with CM Punk concluded this portion of the broadcast, where Punk recounted using Paul Bearer's ashes in a wrestling storyline, with his family's approval, and shared anecdotes about WrestleMania ticket allocation.

A surprise in-studio guest appearance by Mike from *The Real World: Back to New York* followed, reminiscing about the show, including details about cast and crew relationships, unpaid work, underage drinking, and the death of a cast member from a previous season.  This transitioned into a conversation with Ricky Gervais about comedy, free speech, offense, intent versus impact, audience reactions, and the misuse of the term "censorship."  Gervais explored the concept of "rape culture" and the normalization of sensitive topics through humor, sharing his experiences with negative feedback and social media backlash.

Anthony Bourdain then joined, detailing his perilous experiences filming in the Congo, highlighting the presence of rebel groups, the use of local fixers, and surprisingly good cell phone reception. He described "negotiation" involving screaming and threats, recounted anecdotes involving local officials and a fruit basket used diplomatically, and discussed the country's history, including the impact of Belgian colonialism and King Leopold's atrocities.  He contrasted the Congo's past industrialized areas with its current state, discussing the political and economic instability.  This led to a heated debate between Jim Brewer and Anthony Cumia about gun control, with Brewer arguing for gun ownership and Cumia citing the Boston Marathon bombing as a counter-argument.  The argument escalated, touching upon news media coverage and government overreach.  This portion concluded with Jim Norton pitching a darkly comedic reality show concept involving pranks in a maternity ward.

A segment followed brainstorming absurdly morbid ideas for a TV show about baby deaths in a hospital nursery (lion escape, ceiling collapse, etc.), leading to a discussion of offensive "book of lists" titles and an equally outlandish marriage proposal show idea involving a staged kidnapping. They played and mocked a Mad Magazine record album song, "Make It Out."  This segued into "Opie and Anthony's first annual Gay Off," a contest involving increasingly bizarre challenges: tickling until gagging or vomiting, a lap dance competition (with Sal's reluctant participation), and a "nose to asshole" challenge.

Another segment showcased a contest involving heterosexual men performing various acts for a male contestant (Go-Go) and his reactions, with the involvement of their wives.  The acts included face-sitting, ass-to-nose contact, bleach wipe usage, armpit kissing, toe-sucking, and oil massages.  The hosts and contestants used crude and offensive language, with contestants able to "tap out."  The segment concluded before the freestyle round to arouse Go-Go was completed.

The show's final segment detailed a $1500 contest sponsored by IHateStevenSinger.com, where Dave and Sal (John) competed in a 90-second "freestyle" interaction with Gogo, focusing on his pleasure. The segment included explicit descriptions of sexual acts, with Dave's performance deemed awkward and Sal's facing criticism. Heather, seemingly Dave's wife, offered coaching.  Gogo declared both contestants winners, awarding Dave $1500 and Sal $300. The show concluded with plugs for Gogo's appearance on the Robin Bird Show and his social media handles.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission. James Lipton. A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shitface buffoonery.  E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry.  And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers that I have.  What the fuck happened?  Old Pete Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Yes, just as that announcer said the worst of 2013, I again am saying,  it is the worst of 2013. 
[00:00:30]  My name is E-Rock and I am hosting this special for you.  I have been all week and I will continue into next week until Opie and Anthony return on January 6th in the year 2014.  6 a.m. in case you do not know.  Today's show, a lot of cool stuff, a lot of big guest assises, and just some weird, weird shit.  I don't know if we'll ever do again on this program.  Looking down the lineup here, Scott Thorson was in studio.  He was the boyfriend of Liberace.  Wrote the book that the HBO movie behind The Candelabra was based on. 
[00:01:00]  He comes in studio.  Ricky Gervais returns to the show, but without Opie and Anthony.  So how does that work?  We'll explain.  Anthony Bourdain is back on the program.  Everybody's a big fan of Anthony Bourdain.  Jim Brewer, of course, can't have a year-end show without a couple of stories from the great Jim Brewer.  We look at a couple of things from Jim Norton as far as what he's been writing.  Maybe a reality TV show and introduces a new song to the Opie and Anthony program.  Sam, we have a montage of WWE stuff. 
[00:01:30]  We meet Fandango.  Fandango.  CM Punk, The Miz, Heather B from the real world.  They all collaborate in some way or form.  We'll get to that later.  And as Sam puts it, the first annual gay off.  Be coming up a little bit later in this program.  But for now, we're going to start.  It was a sad year for 2013 in the respects that James Gandolfini died.  Tony Soprano, as you may know him, he passed away.  We found some videos online of a guy who does impersonations of the cast of The Sopranos. 
[00:02:00]  His name is Max Cook.  I hope I'm getting that right.  K-O-C-H.  I believe it's pronounced Cook.  If not, I apologize.  Anyway, we're watching some of his videos.  We're having a good time to the point that he was doing some videos with the characters  just because we mentioned him on the show.  Now he's calling in to give a final farewell to James Gandolfini, a.k.a. Tony Soprano.  Open Anthony's worst of 2013.  Hi, who's this? 
[00:02:30]  I fucking died.  Oh, no.  It's not what I fucking wanted.  I'm 51 fucking years old.  What, are you fucking kidding me?  I still have fucking work to do down here.  I'm fucking shattered.  And I'm glad I died in Rome.  It's kind of poetic if you look at it.  Jeez.  Wow.  Wow.  What happened?  Let me tell you something.  I'm a gluttonous son of a bitch. 
[00:03:00]  But more than that, there might be other elements.  Things I can't talk about.  I'll tell you one of the first thoughts I had when I heard he was dead.  Is, fuck, I should have come back that day and met him.  I wish I had, because he was here one day at three, and I was doing something legitimate  for work.  But I remember going, like, I want to go back and meet him, but I think I couldn't.  And I was like, fuck, I was so mad.  Right.  And I go, God, I wish I would have come back and met him.  It's like, you automatically think of my little being affected by it. 
[00:03:30]  It's such an unimportant thing.  I'm glad I never met you.  I've got to be honest.  Everybody thinks I'm a forloving guy.  I'm fucking not.  Leave me the fuck alone.  I'm miserable.  Oh, shit.  That's another thing that Gandalfini probably would have said exactly like that.  Exactly.  Look, I appreciate it very much.  But can you back the fuck away?  You're invaded my personal space.  I'm in no mood.  What?  What are we going to do without Gandalfini? 
[00:04:00]  It's panic.  I don't know what you're going to do.  You're going to fucking shit your ass down and shut the fuck up.  I think a lot of people will be seeing your YouTube videos in the coming days, because  now they're going to be searching out all sorts of Gandalfini stuff.  Yeah.  You know?  I was only 51.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Doesn't make any fucking sense, huh?  I just had a little girl.  Now what?  I never wanted to be one of those deadbeat dads that's not around to take care of the 
[00:04:30]  kids.  I got to tell you something.  This really fucking hurts.  I was having a good time, even though it was a bit of a crank.  What did Brad Pitt say?  Is he all right?  Nah, he's really upset about your passing there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's got a lot to be upset about.  Look at him with his zombie movies.  His long blonde hair.  This Adonis. 
[00:05:00]  He's a good guy, though.  I got to say, I enjoy playing off of him.  Did a couple of movies they got to give me.  Oh.  Man.  Man is right.  What do you have to say about all the people that are really, really, really sad?  I don't know.  I feel really bad for him.  Then again, I'm sort of floating around in these vapors here, and I don't know what's  going on yet.  I mean, I can't tell you there's life after death, because I don't know yet. 
[00:05:30]  Give a man a minute.  It's not like you're boarding a cosmic train.  Fucking Ambien.  Well, did you see the light?  People talk about the light.  People talk about the light, don't they?  I saw AJ.  I saw Beto.  I saw Carmela.  I saw him young.  And then as I started to ascend further up into the sky, they started to get older. 
[00:06:00]  And then I saw babies.  I didn't recognize them.  Very weird.  And then it's like that night at Holstens, when everything went black.  And she got a baby.  I don't want to fucking be dead.  I want to watch my little girl grow up.  This sucks.  Jesus.  Not to mention all the food I'm going to miss. 
[00:06:30]  The food and the beverages and the lifestyle.  I got very comfortable.  I got a lot of respect.  But I was tortured.  Come on.  You got to be pretty fucked up to play a part like that.  Holy soprano.  At least you'll see Christopher when you're there.  Fucking A.T.  Welcome.  Get your fucking ass up here right fucking now. 
[00:07:00]  And let's go for a fucking ride.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to miss him.  What about AJ?  I mean, you think AJ is going to be all right with your passing there, Tony?  I don't know.  I'm going to be fine.  I want money.  I want money.  I've been saying that all day.  Just walking around my house.  I want money.  The eyes really wide.  I'm going to be fine. 
[00:07:30]  It's not fair.  I knew he would die eventually, but not like this.  So now what?  I don't want to lose my bedroom.  Oh, my God.  I did write a script a couple weeks ago, which is really eerily about this.  So it makes it even more compounded now that it's all gone down.  What was the script about?  It's basically Carmela telling T he's got to go because he's dead. 
[00:08:00]  He's got to let go because he goes to the fridge and there's nothing in there for him.  He doesn't understand.  Oh, what the fuck?  You got to keep the meats on tap.  What's the fucking yogurt?  Oh, I'm going to go.  She says, you got to go.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  I live here. 
[00:08:30]  She's like, no, you don't.  You don't live here anymore.  You got to go.  Where am I going?  What am I doing?  I'm fine.  I can take care of everything.  I've got it covered here.  I've made changes in life.  I can do it.  But you need to get out of here.  Okay.  What if I'm scared?  Well, it's going to be okay.  You're not going to go to hell.  I'm not going to tell the whole thing, but it's that. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, wow.  I believe he's on the phone.  It's amazing.  It sounds amazingly like I'm very, very creepy now.  It is creepy.  Now it's creepy.  What's even creepier is that we get a call from Gandolfini from the afterlife and some ass  keeps showing up and taking the phone from him?  Okay.  You got to go.  Max, they don't want to hear you.  They want to hear me. 
[00:09:30]  I know.  I know they do.  But you're very upset.  And you're on Ambien.  No, you're on Ambien.  Now you're going to listen to his schizo talk.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Again, creepy.  Yeah.  You need to work on the Carmela voice.  Anyway.  Fellas, I got to say, you do a good job over there.  I just hope everyone's getting along.  I hope those serious bathrooms are clean enough for you.  I hope at night you're going out, you're having some beverages, and you go home to your 
[00:10:00]  families, because that's all it's about.  It's also about watching horror movies.  What?  Horror movies?  Horror movies are good.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I like watching horror movies, because everyone's a fucking asshole in a horror movie.  You can cathodically watch them all fucking die in horrible, violent ways.  So by the end, you're tired, you've seen a lot of death, a lot of blood, and you feel  pretty good. 
[00:10:30]  Max, thank you, brother.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  A salute.  All right.  A salute.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  That it is, the Worst of 2013. 
[00:11:00]  My name is E-Rock, and we're looking back at this year of all the cool things, all the  funny things, all the cringey things that happened on the Opie and Anthony show.  So in this segment, Scott Thorson is in studio, brought to us by our old pal, Dennis Hoff,  who runs the Bunny Ranch out in Nevada.  Dennis is bringing Scott around, who's promoting his book, Behind the Candelabra, which is the  movie that HBO made.  It's based off the book there with our own Tom Papa.  He's in there as well with Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Anyway, Scott Thorson is in studio.  We talked to him about his book, Living with Liberace, some things behind the scenes. 
[00:11:30]  He tells us some stories about being involved with Michael Jackson and a whole lot more.  Here it is.  Scott Thorson on the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  What did you think?  Did you think of Matt Damon playing you?  I thought he was fantastic.  Oh, you were happy?  Yeah.  Very happy.  The movie's number one.  It's the number one movie since 2004.  It's the...  Freight Spiel.  Yeah.  Freight Spiel.  Oh, it did crazy numbers.  What do you think about Matt Damon pounding Mike Douglas? 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  I'm a fan of both.  I like them more now.  I thought that was great.  Is that how you gave him a pounding, huh?  Catherine's got to be jealous.  Was anything like what you did to Liberace?  Well, I didn't do it quite that hard.  He was a little older, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Was that true, though?  Was he really like...  Because that might have saved your life.  Like, the fact that he wanted...  You wanted to fuck him, and you didn't want him to fuck...  Yeah.  I didn't...  He didn't fuck me, and I didn't fuck him.  Oh, you didn't fuck him.  He blew you, though, right?  He blew me. 
[00:12:30]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What?  Oh, man.  You weren't having anal sex with him?  I thought you were.  You were the giver.  I think just once.  Oh, they copped her once.  No, just once.  But it was always protective sex, and I think that's the reason why I was alive.  But he blew me.  I never blew him, though.  You never blew him?  Oh, man.  You never blew Liberace?  No.  Come on.  What kind of a friend are you?  He had an ugly cock.  It was full of, what do you call it, silicone.  Was it? 
[00:13:00]  He silicone-ed his dick up?  Yeah.  And it was all lumpy, and he was uncut, and it was ugly.  Wow.  He had an uncut, lumpy, silicone cock, and he couldn't get it hard.  Oh, damn.  Because of all the silicone.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  We got it.  How big was it lengthwise?  About that long.  No.  Was he really that long?  Yeah, he was big.  Are you serious?  But he was Italian.  That's why.  You know what they used to do?  And they did this to John Bobbitt, I think, when Ron put him in that movie.  But he wasn't bigger than me, though. 
[00:13:30]  They cut that muscle.  They cut the muscle so it just kind of hangs.  Under the vein.  It gets a lot longer.  Well, don't they pull it out a little bit more, too?  You got a little extra in there?  It makes it longer.  Then they shoot it up with silicone.  You cut the tenon, and then you can pull it actually out to make it longer.  Yeah, like John Bobbitt, when they shot him up with all this stuff, it looked like  a lumpy Red Bull cam.  Oh, man.  Now it's easier.  You can use the cock pumps.  They work great.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they do work.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Dick pump works.  But his dick was long and silicone and lumpy, which meant that it wasn't silicone properly? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, and uncut.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't like uncut?  No, no.  Hey, he's ugly.  Lee's ugly dick.  When you can't pull the skin away from the head, yuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, TMI, Scott.  No, no.  That's phenomenal information.  Just enough information.  That's J-E-I-A.  Just enough information.  So he would suck your dick, and what would you do while you're sucking your dick?  Just think of somebody else, or would you just close and fantasize?  Would you really not?  You never fucked him?  Come on.  Never once?  Just once? 
[00:14:30]  I think once I started you, and I didn't like it.  What did you like about it?  I was only 16 years old.  Come on.  Oh, you were that young?  Yeah, I was young.  How did he get off then?  Like, what was in it for him?  I guess he just jerked.  Yeah.  He had one of those bags that he would use.  One day I caught him using it, you know, when he came in.  What's the bag?  And he quick pulled it up and threw it in the drawer.  I didn't know it was a pump bag, and he was sitting there pumping it, and I was watching.  He didn't know I came in.  I was watching.  That's when he had his wig off, and he threw it over the shower. 
[00:15:00]  I got to tell you a funny story.  Yeah, please.  He flushed an ounce of my cocaine, right?  And I got so fucking pissed off that I chased him down.  Now, this house is 17,000 square feet.  Jesus.  Anyway, he was running for, and I really didn't mean to, but I grabbed him by the back of the  hair, and I pulled the wig off.  And he said, oh, Scott, you're such a bad boy.  Were you sleeping with other people at the time, and was he, or were you? 
[00:15:30]  No, just Michael Jackson.  Did you really sleep with Michael Jackson?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Well, I met Michael in the mid-70s, and I was introduced to him by Liberace, and we just  had a great relationship.  Lee and I broke up in 82, so Michael asked if I would come and work for him.  So this is when he was breaking up with the Jacksons, his brothers, and he went solo. 
[00:16:00]  And this is when Thriller came in, and then we went to Europe, and we did Say Say with  Paul McCartney, Big Hat, Hit, and all that.  And we just hit it off.  Michael fell in love with me.  I was a pretty boy back then.  Were you the giver or the getter there?  No, he was the giver.  Michael was?  Michael was, yeah.  He was the giver?  Yeah.  I was very, you know something, and I'm glad that I was that way because of the AIDS epidemic  back then.  I mean, it was bad.  You know, Rock Hudson, and you know, I saw Rock a week before he died. 
[00:16:30]  Lee and I went over to see him.  Because Rock and him used to fool around years ago.  Oh, boy.  And then they'd have all the sex parties over there.  Boy.  Boy, boy, boys.  How long did you know Michael before it became sexual or became apparent that he wanted to  be sexual with you?  Well, it wasn't until 82, and then we were together until about 85, and then when he started getting  really big, he decided that, well, we better cool this, and then I went my way. 
[00:17:00]  Didn't you guys do a family road trip with the plastic surgery or something?  Oh, yeah.  I got to tell you the funny story.  LaVarache had a full facelift.  I had my cheek implants and the chin.  Michael wants to get his nose done.  No, excuse me.  I back up.  I had gotten my nose done, and Michael loved it, and he hated his nose because it was wide  and looked like Joseph.  He reminded him of his father, and Michael didn't have a good relationship with Joseph. 
[00:17:30]  So, all three of us are bandaged up in the backseat of the Limo Rolls Royce that Lee  drives on stage, going to Palm Springs, and then that crazy doctor, which Rob Lowe plays.  Right, right.  That was great.  We're shooting us up full of Demerong and pharmaceutical cocaine and bifetamines, and this is how Michael  starts his plastic surgery and starts the drug addiction by pharmaceutical drugs. 
[00:18:00]  Wait, can I ask about the Michael Jackson thing?  Did the family ever try to sue you or anything?  Because obviously-  Well, let me tell you.  When I released this article in 2004, Alan Butterfield, the editor of the National Enquirer,  flew in two experts, ex-FBI agents, and did polygraph tests on me.  I passed two polygraph tests. 
[00:18:30]  One was offered to Michael because they were protesting on it.  Michael refused to do it.  The Jacksons have never come after me.  Now, of course, they say, well, oh, no, it's not true, but I mean, I've never been sued.  I did hear from the attorneys in the beginning, and then they backed off once the lie detectors  came in, and then when Michael refused, they told Michael not to do it, obviously, because  Michael, it was true.  Right.  And what is-  And this goes way back. 
[00:19:00]  You know, Liberace called me a fucking liar, a disgruntled employee.  I was a hustler.  I was a porn star.  I walked off streets of Hollywood.  And I had, you know, I was nothing but a liar.  They even paid my brother, Wayne, who passed away, my half-brother, over $20,000 to testify  and make up stories about me, and, you know, they were just a piece of shit back then.  Right.  I got one more question.  What do you think of Michael and the kid thing? 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  Your opinion.  Yeah, it's not-  Those aren't Michael's kids.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Michael with the allegations.  Oh, no.  Michael didn't do that.  See, a lot of people say that it was just that he never really grew up and just felt more  comfortable hanging out with younger people.  Michael would never do that.  He was acquitted for it.  Interesting.  And it was this kid, the kid, I forget the kid's name, but the uncle is the one that,  you know, got the $20 million from Michael. 
[00:20:00]  And so Michael decided, and this came right from Michael.  He was afraid.  So he paid this guy $20 million because he was going to expose him.  Expose him as a child molester.  So Michael paid him off.  But if Michael wasn't a molester, what was he scared of?  Well, he didn't want the bad publicity.  Because it's just like Liberace didn't want the bad publicity about me being 16 years old.  You know, we settled out of court and all that. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, you did settle.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  I'm having a hard time getting my head around Michael being a giver.  Yeah, that really did sound a little-  Now, give me this again.  Michael was the giver.  Yeah, yeah, he was.  Seriously.  He wasn't, he was more of a top and a bottom.  That's an odd thing.  That struck me as odd, too.  I figured he'd be a wimpy little liar.  I know.  That's what I thought, too.  I have to change everything I think of now when I jerk off.  But, I mean, he got into oral sex and all that.  But, I mean, he had a crush on me. 
[00:21:00]  I mean, I was young.  And then I got all the pictures to back it up when Michael and I were at Lord Montague's  and, you know, at Buckingham Palace.  And I'll tell you a funny thing that Michael and I did.  You know, outside the Queens, you know, cast of these guards stand straight.  They're not supposed to move.  Yeah.  So, what we did was we kept putting a, well, we put about five grand on the bayonets  and we kept loading it up with money and pounds and all that.  And we said, now, you can keep this, but we need a picture. 
[00:21:30]  And sure enough, he moved and he grabbed the money.  They're not supposed to do that.  And I sold it to the National Enquirer for ten grand, too.  So, I got back the money.  Scott was involved in the Wonderland murders.  Right, right, yeah.  With John Holmes.  That's the John Holmes thing.  Yeah, and then I got gunned down and shot.  The contract placed.  I mean, I was shot five times.  Let's go with Wonderland.  You knew John Holmes or who?  You were there with John?  I knew him all.  I knew.  Well, here's what happened. 
[00:22:00]  In 81, I took some of my money and I invested it with Nash because he owned a bunch of nightclubs.  Eddie Nash.  Yeah, so he owned like 15 Kit Kat clubs.  You know where the girls would come down in the cage with strippers.  And then Club Hollywood, Starwood, Seven Seas Club Hollywood, The Odyssey.  Anyway, to make a long story short is that Holmes, we would party with Holmes up there at Nash's place. 
[00:22:30]  Nash hooks Holmes on crack cocaine.  The plastic surgeon, my plastic surgeon, or Liberace's plastic surgeon, shoots himself in the head.  Wait, the Rob Lowe character shot himself?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  So I needed a new drug supplier.  Well, Nash brought in all the heroin, cocaine, plus he had Mayor Bradley, Tom Bradley, on his payroll.  A couple of DEA agents.  Anyway, Holmes sets up the robbery. 
[00:23:00]  Leaves the back door open.  They come in there and they stick a gun down Eddie Nash's throat and make him beg.  And they took over a million dollars worth of drugs, cash, and jewelry.  Well, I'm in Tahoe.  We're performing at the Sahara Tahoe.  I take a Learjet back to pick up a pound of cocaine and some cash because I was collecting from the clubs.  Well, in walks, he just had the robbery, maybe a couple hours before I got there. 
[00:23:30]  Well, when I come there, Gregory Diles, his black bodyguard, brings in Holmes and they find out that Holmes set up the robbery.  And they beat the shit out of Holmes and they ordered.  And I was there when Nash gave the orders to have these people killed.  And they used Liberace's Bill Blass Lincoln to drive Holmes up there.  And he participated in some of the killings up there, John did.  Wow.  Now, what was the killing?  There was the robbery. 
[00:24:00]  And then what happened?  Can you walk us through that?  Because Eddie Nash's house was robbed.  Yeah, it was robbed.  So what they did was they found out who was responsible.  Oh, the actual burglar.  And then they were called the Wonderling Gang.  Okay, up in Laurel Canyon, there's a street called the Wonderland Avenue.  So that's why it's called the Wonderling Killings, Laurel Canyon.  And so Nash ordered these people executed. 
[00:24:30]  And they actually killed the wrong people.  One guy was there, but they killed all the girlfriends.  You know, so they killed four girls and one guy.  Or was it three girls and one guy?  And then there was a count of attempted murder.  So there was four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.  Well, you know, the famous homicide detective that handled this case,  that handled O.J., that fucked up O.J.'s case, Tom Lang. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, wow.  That was him?  Yeah.  And so anyway, to make a long story, I testified.  Nash puts a contract on me because he starts smoking that crack and gets all paranoid.  And the next thing you know, I have a contract placed on me.  I go to Florida and I get gunned down and shot.  So I testified.  Nash gets a hold of one of the members of the jury.  11 of them came back with guilty plea, found them guilty.  One was not guilty. 
[00:25:30]  Then back in 99, the feds then decided, well, we're going to go after him for money laundering,  racketeering.  So they brought the murders back because normally you can't double jeopardy.  You can't do that.  But anyway, they did a deal with him.  He pled guilty to conspiracy to commit murder on the Laurel Canyon and also for jury tampering.  The one lady that I told Dale Davidson and all the other district attorney and the U.S. 
[00:26:00]  attorneys that he got to me.  And so there was a jury fraud and then a $250,000 fine.  He only spent 33 months in prison.  Can I ask where you were when you got shot?  You said you were in Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened there?  What was that moment like?  Well, what happened was I went on the Federal Witness Protection Program and I was so fucking  bored.  I mean, these guys, they take you to the loony bin. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, way out in the sticks.  I mean, come on with my life.  And so what I started doing was running cocaine and the perfect thing I could do was running  it with the federal marshals in their car and going through the airport.  They never checked me.  And then I became a preacher.  I did the Billy Graham.  I did the Pat Robertson.  I became.  Yeah, I said, oh, you know, the horrible sins of Hollywood.  And and and they and they ate it up.  But they loved it.  Were you being sincere?  Huh?  Were you being sincere? 
[00:27:00]  For a while.  Then after I found out how the politics in those fucking churches, I mean, I mean, they  were horrible, especially some of this now.  He goes to the witness protection program.  Right.  So nobody can find you and kill you.  We get five bullets in him.  Right.  And then he decides, well, you know, I kind of like the celebrity thing of Liberace.  So I'll just be a minister.  Yeah.  But I want to know about the day you got shot.  Yeah.  What were you doing?  What were you doing?  Where you were surprised?  Like, oh, fuck, they found me.  He's in a hotel in Jacksonville, Florida.  And they come in, they shoot me in the head, the hand here, because I put my hand up and 
[00:27:30]  it went through here and came out there.  Yeah, there you go.  Wow.  Then right above the left nipple, they shot me, penetrated the heart.  And then I took three bullets through the abdomen.  Wow.  With a 38 up close, right from where Dennis.  But, you know, I kept getting up.  You know, I was pretty big back then.  And I managed to break one of them.  They're, you know, kept fighting.  And then finally I says, I better lay down.  You know, I was running out of blood then.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:28:00]  So you got shot in the head, the heart, and three times in the stomach.  Yeah.  And what kind of abdomen damage did it do?  Because the stomach seems like, you know, the motherfucker.  Well, the big thing was, is I was paralyzed and went into my spine.  And then I became paralyzed.  And then the doctors only gave me about 2% chance to live that day.  And then I became, I died.  And they brought me back.  After, like, almost 15 minutes, I was pronounced dead.  Wow.  What do you see?  Anything?  Do you see the light?  No. 
[00:28:30]  I saw the devil.  I saw the barrage big cock.  The big lumpy.  No, but I had to learn how to talk and walk and eat again.  Because I went into a coma.  And then they couldn't, when they were cutting me open, they only paralyzed me.  So I went and moved because my blood pressure was so low.  So I felt all that cutting through the bones and pulling and ripping.  So, I mean, this is what, you know, makes movies and books. 
[00:29:00]  We noticed that you're wearing a lot of jewelry.  Yeah.  Whose is that?  That's some of the gifts that Liberace gave me.  That's why I was wondering.  It looks like it was.  These are some of the ones that I didn't pawn.  Yeah, yeah.  And they threw me out.  So you were worth a lot of money at one point after Liberace, right?  Oh, yeah.  But you see, the Nash got it all.  Well, no, the federal government got it all.  Because when Nash, the killings, they cracked down.  They closed every fucking club.  They took the property for income tax, IRS.  Yeah, there was no way you were getting your money from them. 
[00:29:30]  No.  And you went through.  And you obviously went through a lot of your money.  Oh, well, yeah.  Did you behave fiscally irresponsibly?  I was irresponsibly.  Well, come on.  You know, you got to realize.  You got to realize, you know, all those years with Lee.  And Lee, I mean, you know, he'd spend a million dollars a week on me.  I mean, buying me homes and furniture.  We were in Buffalo, New York.  And Lee comes out. 
[00:30:00]  Well, or no, the manager that owns the theater there, he had a beautiful 1962 Silver Cloud Rolls-Royce, all gold, and with black-handed.  I said, oh, I love that.  Well, my 21st birthday was the following week.  Well, Liberace brought, Baron Hilton had designed, you know, he took the garage out and made a big casino out of there.  But anyway, before he took the doors off, you know, he had that car in there with a big box and ribbon on there. 
[00:30:30]  And then a little box that had the gold Rolls-Royce key in there.  I mean, he was a very generous man.  Oh, man.  Can I ask you what was it?  He was loaded, man.  How much money did Liberace have?  $250 million.  $250 million estate.  Counting cash and real estate.  Wow.  Was it true that Hilton put a casino in your house and tried to get some of his money back?  Yeah.  Huh?  Well, they brought the casino.  Well, the main reason why Baron supplied it with the slot machines and the roulette tables was because of Frances Liberace. 
[00:31:00]  She had a horrible habit of hitting people with a cane.  And they were afraid of lawsuits.  So what they did was Baron loaded the casino, all the slots and the roulette tables and all that.  So we had a private casino.  You know, it was a beautiful home.  Actually, he built that house for me.  It was five track.  He bought the whole block. 
[00:31:30]  And it was a 17,000 square foot palace.  That's nothing but glass and mirror.  It was absolutely gorgeous.  You know, where they filmed all this was at Zsa Zsa Cavour's house.  Oh, wow.  At Zsa Zsa's house?  Yeah, because that was pretty impressive, too.  Did he get to see her?  She's, what, down to her head?  Yeah.  At this point?  They cut her leg off.  Oh, yeah.  She's taking a body part every other year.  I think her husband's just waiting for that day to go.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  He's going to load up on everything there.  He's amazed that she's lasted us long. 
[00:32:00]  I don't doubt it.  Well, she's 93, 94 years old.  But, you know, I don't, I mean, you know, I mean, she, and Zsa Zsa was the bitch.  You know who was the nicest one was Ava.  Ava.  Yeah.  Ava was so nice.  She'd come in with Merv Griffin.  What another queen.  That guy was.  Merv was.  Oh, my God.  Merv, yeah.  Well, you know, he loved Ava Kabor, and that was his front.  And, you know, she made all the public appearances while he was, you know, at home sucking cock. 
[00:32:30]  But, I mean, Merv.  Did you guys ever party with him?  Yeah.  Merv was.  Oh, yeah.  He'd bring his little boy in and do their thing.  Did you guys do swappies and all that?  No.  Did Merv ever suck your penis?  Ava Kabor, pardon me.  Did Merv ever suck your penis?  No, but he could have.  I mean, he was low.  He was more loaded than Liberace.  What happened to Liberace's house?  Is it still there?  Yeah.  They have it up for sale.  They're trying to sell it for $375,000 now.  He put over $2 million in the house.  That's it? 
[00:33:00]  $375,000.  Yeah, but he built it in the $50,000 neighborhood.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  And now it's a drug-ridden area.  Oh, wow.  The museum.  Now, here's a great idea.  Wait, wait.  Liberace's house is in a bad...  I never knew that.  It was always in a bad neighborhood?  Well, this was.  4982 Shirley Street.  It's right off of Tropicana, across the street from the university there.  All bad area now.  Wow.  It's drug.  And then the museum is on Tropicana, right below Maryland Parkway.  I'm the one that put that museum together in 78. 
[00:33:30]  I took everything out of the houses and put it together.  We bought the shopping center.  Of course, when I got in, when we broke up, he took all the pictures of me out of the museum.  But now the museum is bankrupt.  See, the comic goes around.  Now it's bankrupt.  Now they were hoping that this movie would be successful.  So what I would like to do is, Dennis and I are talking about this, is, boy, what a great idea that would be. 
[00:34:00]  Dennis has got 22 acres out there, horse stables.  He's got a gym, you know, $2 million gym out there.  He's got this beautiful bunny ranch.  Put the Liberace, now that he's got a history with me, put the museum out there.  I could tell the stories.  Then we can get a reality show.  Scott Thorson at the bunny ranch.  I'll put on a pink outfit.  I want to see you in your pool boy outfit.  I'm going to make you a bunny boy.  I want to make him a pool boy.  I'll be the bunny boy. 
[00:34:30]  Or either he can start pimping me out.  I mean, maybe he can get $100,000 and I'll give him 50% of it.  I mean, come on.  I've got to ask you about Liberace.  There's rumors that he tried to have you killed after he left.  Well, let me just say this.  I was beat up pretty bad in the penthouse.  This was done by Seymour Heller.  I was also threatened that if I went to the press, that I would disappear in Las Vegas. 
[00:35:00]  But, you know, I had balls back.  I mean, here's a big, powerful man.  Around Michael's chin.  And, you know, Baron Hilton of the Hilton Hotels and all that.  Right.  You know, they told me to stay out of Vegas.  And that's one of the reasons why he even took my house back that he got me out there.  He says, well, I'll give you $75,000 for it.  He says, but you're not coming out here.  I went out there anyway.  I terrorized.  I used to throw eggs at his house. 
[00:35:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, hey, and I went to prison, too.  I forgot to tell you guys.  Wow.  The prison story.  Yeah.  I went to work for the Mexican Mafia cartel and got caught with five pounds of meth.  And I ended up in Corcoran State Prison.  But that was right at the time when I signed the deal with Weintraub.  So I went to prison with $50,000 on my trust account.  Oh, my God.  And I had a ball in prison. 
[00:36:00]  The best looking guys.  And talk about crooked is the Department of Corrections because I bought all the drugs that I wanted.  So you had no problem getting drugs.  No, and they kept me.  I kept Charlie Manson company.  The worst is yet to come.  This is O&A's worst of 2013.  2013.  On the O.P. Anthony Channel. 
[00:36:30]  O.P. Anthony's worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  Continues right now.  Correct.  Worst of 2013 for the O.P. Anthony Show.  My name is E-Rock.  And we're moving into a segment right now that's a montage of WWE moments.  Now, this is great for Sam and me.  A lot of you might be going, what the hell?  I'm not listening to this.  Well, that's your choice.  But a lot of you out there I know are really excited to hear some WWE stuff.  We're going to start off with meeting Fandango. 
[00:37:00]  That's not good at all.  We were watching some videos of Fandango talking about how great this gimmick was that he wouldn't wrestle until somebody got his name right.  And lo and behold, he makes a surprise to the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Then we move into CM Punk as Sam talks to him live on Radio Row at WrestleMania 29.  And then we have The Miz in studio.  And this is one of those cool segments where a guest gets to meet another guest, sort of.  Working next door to us on Sway's morning show on Shade 45 is Heather B, one of the original cast members from the real world. 
[00:37:30]  She comes in, and it's a little bit of a real-world reunion from people who have never met each other.  But first, here's Fandango.  O&A's Worst of 2013.  Well, we're sitting here.  We have the curtains closed.  Yeah, the curtains are closed.  And we're not watching porno, so something's up.  And Sam told us something's up.  There's a little surprise that's about to happen.  Yeah.  The surprise is on its way.  I don't know why.  I'm thinking it's some kind of guest.  I'm thinking it's somebody that we've all kind of talked about. 
[00:38:00]  Why would they just pitch a guest to us, though?  Because it's not pitch-worthy.  They know it's a yes, and they know it's not pitch-worthy.  That's a bold statement.  That's really...  Can you turn on mic seven, please?  Uh-oh.  Why?  Are they going outside with the mic?  I just need mic seven.  Wow.  Travis is mic seven.  When Travis wants mic seven.  Thank you.  Hold on, Sam.  Before the big surprise.  Could we pull a mic outside the studio?  Rolling is the big surprise?  Yes, there he is.  By the door.  Sam, what's going on? 
[00:38:30]  Hold on.  Rolling's hard to get a hold on.  Hold on.  If Roland's here, that means it's a guest.  Okay.  Hang on.  You ready?  Hang on, Roland.  All right.  Are you ready?  Come on.  Obi?  I'm trying to read your face.  How goofy is this?  I'm just asking if you're ready.  I think you were right, by the way.  I still think you were right.  And that means he's a great actor?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anthony, are you ready?  Can I say what I think?  No.  No.  You said...  Oh, there's a film crew.  Don't peek.  Film crew, too.  Don't peek.  Don't peek, Jim.  Jim, are you ready?  I am.  Sorry, but he's ready.  All right. 
[00:39:00]  I told Ed who I think he is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Eric, hit the music.  Yeah!  Let that go!  Oh, man.  He's dancing his way in.  He's lotioning up.  This is fantastic.  Oh, my God.  It's him.  Oh, that's it this morning.  Wow.  Oh.  Jimmy's putting some lotion on. 
[00:39:30]  Hold on.  Hold on, Jimmy.  Hold on.  This is...  Thank you very much.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Jimmy, can you do that again?  Come on.  Easy.  Easy.  Come on.  Easy.  Easy.  What are you doing?  Oh, wow.  Jimmy's oiling him down.  Oiling.  Thank you.  This is fantastic.  Look at the wonderful sequin vest.  Jimmy, you want to get his abs?  Oh, get his back off.  Oh, he threw his sequin vest at me.  I'm honored.  Jimmy is really getting into lotioning up. 
[00:40:00]  He needs to be lotioned.  What?  What?  What's your name?  Uh, Jim, sir.  Okay, no.  What's my name?  Fandango.  Oh.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Fandango.  You need, Johnny, you need to feel it, Johnny, okay?  It's FANDANGO.  Knock the lotion over. 
[00:40:30]  He knocked over.  Don't get nervous, okay?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'll try it again.  Try it again.  FANDANGO.  FANDANGO.  No.  That was pretty good.  Jacob.  Jacob.  You gotta feel it.  You gotta let the A's breathe.  FANDANGO.  FANDANGO.  Go. 
[00:41:00]  Try it.  It's your work.  All right, go ahead.  FANDANGO.  FANDANGO.  He's already shaking his head no.  Come on, Jimmy.  No?  Not good enough?  What did I do wrong?  I will not come to this Mickey Mouse outfit of a show, okay?  Oh, man.  He's got that right.  Okay, Johnny?  Yeah, Johnny.  He just cost everybody here, and all, you know, the hundreds and thousands of listeners 
[00:41:30]  across the world the chance to hear the debut of FANDANGO.  Curly, is this what we're gonna do?  This is what we're gonna do.  Curly?  Sunday?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Okay.  Whoa.  These are real.  It's a real deal.  These are real.  How many?  Four.  Four. 
[00:42:00]  Figure it out.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Decide who wants to come.  Tickets.  Whoa!  WrestleMania just fell down your desk.  Whoa!  WrestleMania tickets.  Everything that goes down there is mine.  You can see the real debut of...  Oh, of?  Uh-oh.  Everybody.  Everybody in the room.  Here we go.  Yeah, yeah.  FANDANGO!  And there he is.  Wow! 
[00:42:30]  And the music.  There's the music, the dance.  What?  I'm honored.  And now he's down here.  That's it.  There he goes.  Strutting out.  That is wonderful.  I love it.  FANDANGO!  Oh, look at this.  Whoa!  That is something right there.  All right, that was cool and all.  Does he come back in now for an interview or no? 
[00:43:00]  No, were you kidding?  No, that was it.  Oh, nice.  We are going to WrestleMania, people.  Yeah!  That's it.  That's what you get.  We don't get the real interview now.  Real?  You didn't say his name right.  No, I thought Jimmy did a pretty good job.  I thought Jimmy did very well also.  I thought Jimmy did a great job.  I think he's using that as an excuse to not wrestle.  Right.  You know, I don't know if anyone's brought this up, but I think he's using it as an excuse 
[00:43:30]  to not wrestle.  Look, Jim did a pretty good job?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't make it right.  That makes it pretty good.  And that's not what...  He did it perfectly.  He did it perfectly.  He lets the A's breathe and everything.  I'm starting to think that he doesn't want to wrestle.  I'm thinking he doesn't want to wrestle.  He doesn't want to wrestle.  Well, we'll see him with Chris Jericho on Sunday, won't we?  And what do you think will happen?  I think Chris Jericho has his work cut out for him, quite frankly.  Oh, stop it.  Jericho's a pro.  Does it?  Jimmy was lotioning.  I was lotioning Fandango. 
[00:44:00]  You really were.  You really enjoyed that.  But this is what bothers me about myself.  At one point, I actually threw my headphones off so I could lotion the man properly.  Wrong of me.  I think he's wearing underpants.  I wanted to lotion the man properly.  Chris Jericho never cared how his name was said before he got in the ring.  Right.  I think Fandango has a problem.  Did I do good?  Yeah.  At one point, he called you Jacob.  Yeah.  And he called me Johnny.  Johnny.  He's not good with names. 
[00:44:30]  You don't think I did it well?  He did it...  I told them, you did it very good.  Yeah.  You didn't do it right.  Fandango.  What a great cop-out excuse this guy has.  It really is a cop-out.  For not getting in the ring and mixing it up.  He just gets in there and says, you know, you didn't say my name right.  I'm leaving.  I'll be honest.  I felt those guns.  He's ready to wrestle.  I have lotioned the man up.  He's in fine physical shape.  He really was a fine specimen of manhood.  Yeah, he really was. 
[00:45:00]  He's definitely not...  He's prepared to get into the ring.  Yeah?  Sure.  I can feel that, yeah.  I guess we'll find out Sunday.  And I've tussled with Jericho as well.  We shot something together where I had to throw him.  He fell to the ground and I had to jump on him.  So what do you think?  Yeah, who are you going to be?  You're going to be at WrestleMania.  You've got the tickets now.  Well, hard to say.  I mean, I have to go with Jericho because he's a friend of mine.  You didn't ever lotion him.  That is true, despite many requests via email. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  Well, the WWE is asking if you'll take a break so they can film your reactions to Fandango.  Oh, well.  Sure, of course.  That was a great surprise.  I nailed it by the way.  I nailed it.  He did.  I nailed it.  Right beforehand.  I never would have guessed it.  I'll be guessed.  And fucking Oscar winning Travis.  Yeah, because I go, Travis, I know what's going on.  And I said, he goes, nah.  That was good, Travis.  Thank you.  You got me.  Yeah, it was very subtle.  You just went like, nah.  Like, don't even think that.  I laughed so hard, I'm crying.  That is such a great fucking bit.  That music. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  That's why you couldn't go to the bathroom.  Because even though when he showed up, he was wearing sweatpants, his sequin tights  were popping out through the bottoms.  You have this video of me lotioning.  I'm uploading a quick video from my phone of Jimmy lotioning up Fandangas.  It was funny.  It's going to be available on my YouTube channel in a few minutes.  He kept saying, go with the grain.  Go with the grain.  That was quite the surprise for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:46:30]  And obviously the fans basically saying, if ever you guys needed a visual element.  Just making our point over and over again.  Yeah.  Sam and Roland and the gang set up the Fandango.  Fandang.  I figured it out, by the way.  You got to do the G twice.  Fandango.  You said it that way, too, by the way.  If you would have done that. 
[00:47:00]  We did.  You probably would have.  We said his name perfectly.  He doesn't want to wrestle.  I'm not fooling around with this shit anymore.  The guy doesn't want to wrestle.  If you had said his name right, he would have stuck around and done an interview.  I feel like I chased him out because when I said, go, I thought I did really well.  And then he left.  I felt like I ruined everything.  He did it a little wrong.  Did I?  I think he was fooling with you, too.  He said, you got the go right.  And I'm like, oh, finally, someone at least got part of it right.  And he said, and that's what I'm going to do.  Go.  I knew when you said we left.  I knew when you said we had a surprise, it was somebody kind of quirky that we've been 
[00:47:30]  kind of talking about lately.  That was great.  Was it a stretch, though, that it was somebody that had to do with wrestling?  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  And then we just filmed something for WWE.com.  We'll see if that makes it up there.  It'll go up there.  They were excited about it.  They are, huh?  Yeah.  And Joe Vila, our guy over there, helped set it up.  But yeah, I was worried yesterday that because Michael Cole, you know, he did the after show  and you guys passed him in the hall.  But he talked to Opie a little bit.  And he had just found out that this was happening. 
[00:48:00]  But I didn't know if he, like, I told him it was a surprise.  Right.  But when he ran into you, he goes, you brought up Fandango as soon as you saw him.  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, I'm in again.  Because I haven't really, I really haven't watched wrestling in a while.  I keep tabs on our guys that we like, like CM Punk and Chris Jericho.  The guys, Mick Foley, when he does his thing every once in a while.  You know, the guys that have been really good to us over the years.  Yeah.  But in general, I'm not a regular viewer.  But the Fandango thing has got me back. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, it's just hilarious.  It's such a ridiculous gimmick.  But like Cole goes, you said, yeah, we're all on with this Fandango thing.  Right.  And then Cole goes, yeah, I heard you guys.  And I go, oh, shit.  He's going to blow it.  And then he goes, we're talking about him.  Ah, I heard you guys are going to have him.  Right.  What does Mike Cole do?  He's the lead announcer.  He's the commentator.  Yeah, he does a very good job.  He's been there for a long time now.  He's the voice of the company. 
[00:49:00]  I got to say, during the break, we got to meet him.  And for real, we got to meet the man that plays Fandango.  And he wants it known, I don't think I'm blowing up his spot, that he's a man.  Yeah, he's definitely a guy.  It was hilarious how he wanted to make sure every guy he talks to knows that this is his gimmick.  I'm not giving anything away.  He wants you to know, look, dude, looks a little weird, but I am a man.  He didn't say that, but he indicated he's just a guy. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  He's a fucking dude.  He wanted to make sure you knew that.  And then he's talking about his father, who's a truck driver.  He's like, so, now you're Fandango.  Right.  His father writes him.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I love it, though.  We're all in.  It's hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  That was an honor, getting our WrestleMania tickets from Fandango.  He's not doing any other press.  No.  No.  He is a very entertaining guy.  I'll say that.  I'm looking forward to this.  I've never been to a WrestleMania. 
[00:50:00]  This is going to be a lot of fun for all of us.  Especially all the guys we've interviewed.  We've interviewed almost everybody on the card.  Now we're being told we want to take the hotline.  So, who's on the hotline?  Hey, nerds.  Nerds.  Oh, yeah?  It's Fandango.  Listen up.  Listen up.  I'm going to give you one more opportunity to get my name right.  Here we go, okay? 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Try it again.  Try it again.  Fandango.  He hung up on me.  He just hung up on me.  He hung up on me.  It's like we're 12 years old today.  The gimmick is fantastic.  I know.  And there's a part.  I really want to get it right.  I want to be the special boy who died.  He all got it right.  He finally gets it right.  Every single one of us got it right.  His entrance for WrestleMania is going to be ridiculous. 
[00:51:00]  It's going to be fucking ridiculous.  So over the top.  He did a run-in on Monday.  He just interrupted somebody's match.  Of course.  And even when he was just interrupting a match, they brought down his big gold sequined curtain  and played his music.  Why?  You know what he did on Monday?  You guys would have laughed.  Now, you know how he's doing the dancing thing?  Yeah.  He went out while Chris Jericho was wrestling.  And every time Chris Jericho did a move, he held up a number that was low.  Like, he held up like a three or a two or a zero. 
[00:51:30]  That's such a great gimmick.  CM!  Yeah.  CM Punk!  Good morning.  Hi, buddy.  Sorry.  It's a little too early for that energy.  I apologize.  It's what you guys are used to.  You work horrible hours.  Absolutely.  Can I give you guys an E-Rock update as we hear from CM Punk?  You know E-Rock, right?  Yeah, I remember E-Rock.  He's a...  That's great.  You guys can see me, right?  No, they can't.  No, they can't.  All right, never mind.  Why would we have a visual?  I don't know.  They were talking about how E-Rock completely just wormed his way into coming to this so 
[00:52:00]  he could see wrestlers.  Which is weird.  E-Rock, you should have seen him.  I go, they're bringing guys out, E-Rock, so get ready to film or whatever.  And I turn around, I see Punk walking to the table, E-Rock's nowhere to be found, and he's  running.  He has to run past Punk to get to the table on time.  He wasn't here.  Why?  I don't know.  There's bagels in the back, I think.  CM, I gotta tell you, that whole Paul Bearer angle is amazing. 
[00:52:30]  I love it.  Thanks.  I freaking love it.  And we've been calling the shots from here going, he's gonna take those ashes and  he's gonna pour them on The Undertaker, and you did just that the other night.  That is sick.  Yeah, I know.  It's like next level, right?  Yeah, because the guy actually died.  Yep.  In real life.  Paul Bearer is dead.  I didn't kill him.  And then having Paul Heyman come out as Paul Bearer was a nice little twist.  Paul Heyman pulled it off. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, absolutely.  He looked like, I don't know if you guys know who Sven Gulli is.  No.  He was this local, like, local campy, like, horror movie guy who, you know, like, would  show horror movies and dress up.  He looked exactly like Sven Gulli to me.  It was kind of a throwback to my childhood.  Like Zacherli?  Right on.  Right.  Right.  And even though you're doing all this horrific stuff, you still can't really completely  turn the crowd, because they just love you, no matter what.  Well, I, you know, I'm the rotten human being I am. 
[00:53:30]  I would cheer somebody if they dumped out somebody's ashes, too.  I think that's funny.  You know, I would go, and you guys would, too.  You know, so, you know, there's obviously that demographic of people who, no matter what  I do, you know, it's never going to be enough.  They're always going to cheer me.  That's all, you know, that's what every person wants to do, and they see an urn with ashes  in it, is you just want to dump them on somebody.  Yeah, absolutely.  Nothing better to do with them, so it was perfect.  Right.  Have you heard from Paul Bearer's family with this angle?  When I showed up in Indianapolis, which would be, it was, like, maybe three weeks ago, and 
[00:54:00]  it was just a couple days after he had passed, his sons were there, yeah, and I talked with  them.  I'm sure they were cool with it.  But, you know, they were almost falling all over themselves to make sure that I knew  that, you know, they were in constant contact with officials and that, you know, he would  have wanted the entire show to be dedicated to him, which it was, you know, the big memorial 
[00:54:30]  and stuff like that, and, you know, I think that was the night I wrestled Kane, and I actually  stole the urn, so they were on board.  Nice.  Oh, good.  Good to hear.  Yeah, yeah, and they, you know, I think they get it, you know, this is pro-wrestling, you  know, like, we want people to be outraged.  How excited are you to be doing WrestleMania in New York?  Oh, I think it's cool.  You know, I think New York's one of the better fan bases, obviously.  I mean, it's sort of home for the WWE. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  You know, it started in the Northeast, and, you know, this is always, like, obviously when  we do the garden, it's a special event, so this is, I mean, this is wild.  I'm excited.  It's like in an outdoor stadium.  Well, Jim Norton's not excited because he thinks he's going to be cold or rained on.  I know.  I'm going to have to wear my winter hat.  Yeah, just wear a nice, oh, your poor little dome.  Just wear, like, a nice Patagonia jacket or, you know, you'll be warm, Jim.  So, now, let me ask you, people who, like, are really close, where did we get to sit? 
[00:55:30]  Because we're in the first section.  Yeah, we're trying to figure out if WWE actually took care of us or if they're, like, going,  just give them these seats over here.  We're not on the ground.  We're not on the floor, as they say.  You're going to freeze your ass off then, probably.  I probably will be, right?  Yeah.  Because we can maybe stick you under the ring with Hornswoggle.  I think the ring's actually going to be heated, which is interesting.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to keep the wrestlers all warm.  Maybe there's a chance the entire ring bursts into flames. 
[00:56:00]  God.  I could always hope.  When you give people tickets, where do they usually sit?  Well, that all depends on who it is and when they ask.  Because I got some real asshole friends who will try to ask me for tickets to WrestleMania, like, Sunday morning.  Right, right, right.  And I'll be like, yeah, sure.  And then I'll purposely try to give them the most obstructed view, you know.  For being assholes.  Yeah, but if it's, you know, it's somebody I like, I'll stick them in the front row or whatever.  Yeah, but to be fair, ONA didn't ask for WrestleMania tickets until, like, maybe two weeks ago when they saw Fandango for the first time. 
[00:56:30]  All right, you don't have to tell them.  And then they decided, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, I know what Sam just did that.  That's why I'm shutting him down.  Why did you have to tell CM Punk that we're into the Fandango thing?  That's the only, I mean, see, literally they've said, you, because you're fun to hang out with, and Fandango, because he's fun to watch, are the only things they're interested in WWE.  I think he's great.  Fandango's awesome.  I'm not going to lie, because CM Punk, you know, he's been an incredibly nice tour to us. 
[00:57:00]  I always take a look at what you're doing in the WWE.  I appreciate that.  And then Fandango, that whole bit kind of was funny to us, sorry.  Have you seen, why are you apologizing?  I think it's great.  Have you seen the video of Fandango, of Jim oiling up Fandango?  No.  Fandango was in this week, and Jim lotioned him.  I lotioned him.  I did not oil him.  He handed me lotion and needed it applied, so I was a helpful boy.  Did you apply it to the front or the back, Jim?  It was only to his forearms and to the small of his back and a bit on his chest, wherever the lotion was needed. 
[00:57:30]  Well, Jimmy's lying.  I didn't turn the camera on in time to see him lotioning his pecs.  Did I lotion his pecs?  Yes, yes.  I missed that shot.  I did miss that.  But not his dick.  I didn't lotion his abs or his dick.  No, you were too busy staring at his dick, remember?  He wasn't wearing underpants.  You know what?  It's hard not to stare.  He's got those high-waisted cock pants that are very popular.  And they're glistening in their shiny pants.  How do you not look?  I think Jimmy just tweeted. 
[00:58:00]  Did you tweet the picture?  Of course I did.  Jimmy tweeted the picture, so it's Jim Norton on Twitter.  There's a great picture of Jimmy staring at his dick as Fandango is kind of flexing at  our door here.  I wasn't staring at his dick.  My eyes were sleepy.  All right.  We just want to say hi, CM.  I'm sure Sam will do a real interview for the wrestling fans.  You and Chris are the main reason I'm going.  I really want to see you guys.  So it's my first time going.  I'm looking forward to it.  Cool.  Yeah.  Well, it's always a good time. 
[00:58:30]  I mean, WrestleMania is ridiculously huge.  So even if you're not into wrestling, the spectacle of it all is pretty overwhelming.  It'll be fun.  You're going to love it, Jimmy.  I know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Yeah.  All right.  Take care, brother.  Thanks, CM.  Good talking to you guys.  Bye-bye, man.  We're doing a real-world...  Back to New York, season 10.  Back to New York, season 10.  It was season 10 back in 2001?  Over a decade ago, by the way.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  You know the original New York broad works here now.  No kidding.  I always forget her name.  She's really nice to us every morning.  Heather.  Heather B.  Heather B. 
[00:59:00]  Heather B.  That's like from the original.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like 20 years ago.  Exactly.  We say hi to her every morning.  She looks exactly the same.  She broadcasts right next door.  And did you know...  Here's another did you know.  In 2000, when I was shooting The Real World Back to New York, I went to a comedy show  at Caroline's, and you were there.  Oh, wow.  Was that...  I must have...  You were...  No.  And here's...  Mitch.  Mitch...  Mitch...  Mitch Fattel.  Mitch Hedberg.  Was I working with Hedberg?  Hedberg or something like that?  Hedberg or Fattel.  Hedberg, I think.  I was working with Mitch Hedberg?  Something like that.  You remember working with Mitch Hedberg? 
[00:59:30]  No.  I knew him, so we worked together.  This was like 12 years ago.  Wow.  So, I mean...  But I saw you, and I was like, this guy is incredible.  Like, you were the best out of everybody.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, yeah.  I don't remember that week.  And...  I told you.  Hello.  Come and say hi.  From the real world.  Yeah.  I don't think I've ever met her.  Actually, I think I've met her working with you.  You ever...  Yeah.  I was just talking with you.  Oh, my God.  See?  It's nice to meet you.  My nephew told me all about you, and I was like, oh, shit.  We were just talking nicely about you, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Thank you guys so much.  Oh, man. 
[01:00:00]  Y'all always waves it up next door.  I've never actually been in here, and I heard you were in the building.  I was like, I've never met him.  A couple of real-world alumni.  I know.  This is crazy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And we're old school, by the way.  Like, well, she's old, old school.  I'm semi-old school.  We don't think you're old, old school.  Well, I mean, she's the originator.  She's an original.  Yeah, she's an original.  So it's like, that's old school.  I mean, you know what?  That's original.  She's the founder of this thing.  Now, 28 seasons later.  Wow, it's like a fraternity.  Did you ever think?  It's like a fraternity, man.  You guys, I can see.  I know.  You've been through the experience together. 
[01:00:30]  Thank you.  John Brennan always speaks highly of you.  Oh, my God.  John.  Yeah, he speaks highly of you.  True story.  True story.  I know I do that a lot, too.  But I just wanted to come and say hi.  I was so happy.  I just feel like we went to the same school or something.  Yeah, exactly.  It's almost like a family with the rear wheelers and road rollers.  It's every time you meet people, it's like, oh, my God.  I was on the show.  I was like, oh, then we have something in common.  Right.  It seemed like everyone slept with each other, too.  Oh, my God.  No sex on my season.  No, no, no. 
[01:01:00]  Really?  No, only the cast member got the director kicked off, Becky.  She got the director fired because she slept with him in Jamaica.  They tried to get us to go with some Jamaicans, but that didn't work out.  Only the crew and the cast hooked up.  Yeah.  None of our cast really hooked up as well.  The only people that was hooking up was me, and I was bringing girls in.  And the weird part was, I don't know on your season, but on my season, we had cameras in  the rooms, and we didn't realize they were, you could see in the dark, because at that 
[01:01:30]  time, by the way, that wasn't happening.  It never happened.  And so, like, I remember, you know, watching it with my mother, and my, you know, just,  you know, because we don't get advanced copies, you know, so I'm watching it on TV with everybody  else, and Coral's like, Mike had sex in the bed.  And then it shows me, like, under the covers, like, you know, in that green, like, lighting,  and I'm like, and she's looking at, my mom's looking at me like, oh my god, Michael. 
[01:02:00]  And I'm like, mom, I'm sorry, I didn't know.  Yeah, stop watching it, mom.  Yeah, it's all scripted.  It's fake.  But I was like, mom, you have to admit, she's a pretty girl.  So, I mean, at least she can be proud of me about that, right?  I just remember you being in love with Larry Johnson.  I was so in love with Larry Johnson.  I was excited.  Anytime I hear the name Larry Johnson, I instantly think of you, because you became synonymous with  Larry Johnson.  Are we talking about Charlotte Hornets?  Yes.  Yes.  Like, are we going?  Yes.  Yes.  It was hilarious. 
[01:02:30]  You went to the game, and you got to, like, and you're like, oh, there he is.  And it was hilarious.  Yeah, no, I had no idea what I was going to say.  I love sports, basketball and football in particular, and just fell in love with him when he was  at UNLV.  And it was an opportunity.  When they asked me during the audition, who would I like to meet?  I said, Larry Johnson.  They said, who the hell is Larry Johnson?  And so, I said, I would go to a game when he comes to play the New Jersey Nets.  And when I saw him, I just said, I heard you wanted to meet me.  And our whole conversation started from there.  He was really nice.  I ran into him a couple of times. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, really?  Afterwards, he was really nice.  And he's just been cool.  You know, I haven't seen him in a while.  Wow.  I always tell him I'm famous now, too.  You know.  So, it's all good.  That's great, man.  But I just wanted to come and say hi, Mike.  And it's really good to meet you.  I've never seen you in any reunion shows or anything.  So, I just wanted to say hi and congratulations with everything.  Well, it was a pleasure meeting you as well.  You, too.  And thank you.  Good luck with everything.  Thank you so much.  All right.  Y'all take care.  All right.  I actually popped in.  Take it easy.  Bye.  That's so cool.  You've got to love SiriusXM, right? 
[01:03:30]  That's so cool.  Oh, my God.  You never know who's going to pop in.  She's been really nice to us.  You know, I see her all the time and say hello.  I didn't know she was ever on a TV show.  The original.  The original.  The originator right there.  That was the one that was like, wow.  Heather.  Heather, right?  Heather B.  She's great.  Her, Eric Neese.  Eric Neese.  Norman.  I remember these days.  And the little skinny white girl that was a dancer.  She would always like.  Mindy Cone?  That was her name.  I haven't thought of these names in a long time. 
[01:04:00]  Maybe.  Maybe someone will get it.  So, they invite you to the reunion?  You just don't do it, huh?  Well, not even that.  We've even had one in a very long time.  And anytime they do, I've actually hosted some of the reunion shows for Real World and Real  Real World's challenges.  But we just never cross paths.  I go to the reunion shows.  I'm not one of those people that I'm like, oh, well, I have to stay away because I'm a  new WWE superstar now.  Of course you go.  Then you look.  No.  Look what I did.  Look at me.  I'm a WWE superstar.  So, what are you doing? 
[01:04:30]  Oh, I'm a WWE superstar.  The Real World really got fucked up.  I mean, you know, now they just get them drunk and they're in the house.  But isn't that what you want to see?  You want to see that train wreck.  You want to see fights.  You want to see yelling.  But how long were you in the house?  Five months.  Now they're doing it differently.  They're doing barely a month.  Three months.  No.  The challenges are one month, but The Real World is three months now.  So, they're still putting in some time.  And I was in New York City.  By the way, I was a college student. 
[01:05:00]  I didn't have money.  And when you're in New York City, it's hard to get by on that college salary.  And they're not paying you when you're on The Real World.  They're not like, oh, hey, since you're on TV, here's money.  Let me fill up the food.  They don't give you a taste?  No.  No.  We had to pay for our own alcohol, too.  And I wasn't even 21 at the time, so I had to have a fake ID and everything.  You weren't 21?  They didn't give you a taste?  They didn't give you food?  No.  Nothing.  I had to buy my own food.  How do they justify that?  Because it's The Real World.  You're living like you would in a real situation. 
[01:05:30]  It's not like, you know, it's as real as real could be on TV.  Yeah.  Julie Gentry.  Julie Gentry.  Very good.  That's Julie.  She was, I remember her dancing to that.  It's a wiggle it just a little bit.  And she's fucking like really going at it and shit.  I have no memory of that.  That's how long ago?  20-some-odd fucking.  I didn't.  Crazy.  I started watching the second season more than the first.  I think everyone has their season that they watch.  I was a Real World New Orleans fan. 
[01:06:00]  Really?  The one with Puck was great.  Puck was amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  Puck and Pedro.  Puck and Pedro.  You put your fingers in the peanut butter, Puck.  I'm not going to sit here while you put your fingers in the peanut butter.  I think that's like the most known line in real world history.  You put your fingers in the peanut butter.  You pick your scabs and then you put your fingers in the peanut butter.  You pick your nose in your snot rockets.  And the kid was deteriorating right in front of your eyes.  Is he dead again?  He died shortly after that season came out. 
[01:06:30]  He was AIDS, right?  He had HIV?  Oh, yeah.  They had his T-cell count every week.  Remember all that?  Yeah, yeah.  There was good news and a lot of bad news.  And I remember being at a Black Crow show when they announced he died.  Really?  And it was shortly after that season was on TV.  Mm, man.  No more than a year later.  Yeah, it was definitely sad and tragic.  But I think that's the first time that you saw a person with HIV or AIDS on national television.  And that's when the real world brought such new stuff to the table. 
[01:07:00]  You realize they were real people.  Yeah, exactly.  It was the real world.  It touched your heart.  And then Los Angeles.  And then you came to me on the real world back to New York running around naked and just doing whatever and getting into fights.  You know, it used to stand for something.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it's just drinking and fighting.  Mm-hmm.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up? 
[01:07:30]  Coming up, O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 continues next.  This is O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  So far, so good.  We're about halfway through with the worst of 2013 for O.P. and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter if you care to follow.  If not, that's fucked up.  But anyway, we're moving into Ricky Gervais being back on the show. 
[01:08:00]  We love when Ricky Gervais is on the show.  So much so that O.P. and Anthony seem to leave every time that Ricky Gervais is booked on the show.  It's a weird trend that keeps happening, but he's here being interviewed by our own Sam and Jim Norton.  But we still have a good time talking about his career.  What was his new project, Derek, which is available on Netflix.  If you haven't seen it, it's a great series.  You should check it out.  Ricky Gervais here on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Well, sort of.  The O.P.'s worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  You talk about the language where they say he got in trouble for Sam going to kill this guy or whatever it was he said. 
[01:08:30]  I mean, now you do stand-up.  And what are you feeling about it?  Because I know how I feel about the language policing that's going on in stand-up  or the obsession over terms and all this stuff that people are giving comedians.  Well, I think it depends.  I mean, I assume you're talking about offense.  Yeah, or what people find are offensive or inappropriate.  Well, offense isn't a case of right and wrong, is it?  It's about feelings, and feelings are personal. 
[01:09:00]  I think you've got to, you know, comedy comes from a good or a bad place.  You've got to know, you know, what side you're on.  But I can't believe it.  Now, Roland's talking.  I know, Roland, he does that a lot.  It's rude.  Roland, he'll just come in and dare people to look at him while he does it.  So, I mean, you have to take everything.  When people say to me, I ask comedians this all the time,  is there anything you wouldn't joke about?  Right?  Firstly, the answer's no. 
[01:09:30]  There's nothing you shouldn't joke about.  It depends what the joke is.  Okay?  But people don't say that to writers.  They don't say to a novelist, is there anything you wouldn't write about?  Well, no.  So we know it's about how it's treated.  So they assume that comedians treat things without care, due care and attention.  They're not considered.  Like, they have no morality.  I see this all the time on Twitter.  This people who think that, they say things to me like, 
[01:10:00]  so are you never offended by anything?  I say, of course I'm offended by things.  But it's personal.  But what I'm offended about isn't the same as you.  You know, you can't, it's not objective.  And you don't want people penalised for offending you.  You don't want them to get in trouble if they offend you.  No.  Again, you have to be specific.  You can't really talk in the nebulous because it's too difficult.  So in my show, I deal, the big thing is that very often, 
[01:10:30]  particularly with taboo subjects, which is what we're talking about,  very often people mistake the target of the joke with the subject of a joke.  And they're very rarely related, particularly in comedy,  particularly if it's mildly satirical,  and particularly if it's a good comedian who knows what they're doing.  So people's, they get stiff when you talk about, you know,  race, disability, religion, okay?  But wait, wait, because everything I deal with is in those taboo subjects. 
[01:11:00]  And you talk about, like now, we're not trying to be funny.  We're talking.  And so we're using all those terms.  No one's angsty.  No one's going, because they know there's not a joke.  We know that we're discussing it.  And they know that, you know, you can talk about those subjects.  But when it comes to a comedian, and obviously very often comedians aren't being themselves.  They're being a heightened version or they're being a provocateur or they're trying to take  the audience to places it hasn't been before.  And people get confused.  And I think that it comes down to people getting it or not. 
[01:11:30]  And I sort of, I want to sort of say to people, you not getting my joke isn't my problem, really.  I shouldn't even be defending it.  I shouldn't even be talking about comedy as a comedian.  I should, you know, but I do because I like to do it as an interest.  But I'm not talking about this as an expert or as a professional.  I'm talking about this as just a person because I like discussing these issues and, you know.  And we all know the difference between, and this is what bothers me about people's fake outrage.  I don't believe the outrage because we all know the difference in intent when someone's 
[01:12:00]  intending to make you laugh and the difference between that and when someone's making a serious  statement.  Yeah.  There's a different intent and a different effect you want it to have on the audience.  And they know that.  And they pretend they don't know it.  Well, I think comedy is an intellectual pursuit.  And I think as soon as it gets emotional on purpose, i.e. with intention from the comedian,  it stops being funny and it stops being comedy.  It starts being rallying.  I mean, I've heard some so-called comedians come out and they say things like, what are 
[01:12:30]  we going to do about all these immigrants?  And it gets a round of applause from the audience.  Well, that's not a joke.  Right.  There's no punchline.  That's political.  That's just you putting your agenda across with like-minded people, you know.  So I'd say that.  And then very often they say, well, do you think that's so-and-so joke?  I want to say, well, it wasn't a joke.  You know, like Michael Richards going crazy, you know, he was stressed, someone upset him,  he wanted to hurt that person's feelings, right?  That wasn't comedy. 
[01:13:00]  I think he stepped outside of comedy.  I'm not disclaiming it because I'm a comedian.  I want to say, I think he did something other than comedy.  He was reacting angrily as opposed to being funny.  Definitely.  Exactly, yeah, yeah.  Well, he wasn't being a comedian.  He was being a bloke who was a, he stepped out of character almost.  And we're always in character a bit when we're, you know, we're being a comedian.  And we want the audience to make that leap with us.  What about the idea, and somebody hit you with this on the phone earlier this week,  like the responsibility that you have for, because you're talking to an audience. 
[01:13:30]  So like, let's say the audience doesn't get your nuance or doesn't understand what you're  saying and takes the context of your joke and-  But, well, I don't think you should legislate against stupidity.  Uh-huh.  Because there's only so many nods and winks to cameras before you're not doing anything  special at all.  If everyone gets what you say, there's not much to get.  Why do we want everyone to understand it?  Why do we want to talk to a groom full of adults who have paid $100 the same as we talk 
[01:14:00]  to a five-year-old?  You know?  Yeah.  You talk to a five-year-old because they have to get what you're saying.  It's important that they understand what you're saying without ambiguity.  Uh, with, with no frills, with no, with no agenda, with no, um, double meaning or level.  Don't, don't put your hand in the fire.  Why not?  Don't.  Don't put your hand, do you understand me?  Don't put your hand in the fire.  Yeah.  That's not my job as a comedian to tell them not to put their hand in the fire.  Not to fucking spoon feed them.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:14:30]  I, I, I, I, I've entered a contract here and the contract is I'll say what the fuck I  like.  And if you don't like it, don't come again.  Or just get up and quietly go like people with the whole Tosh incident about the rape  joke.  And it was like that woman was wrong because she heckled.  Like I, I thought that she had every right to get up and leave because if you're not enjoying  something, you should just leave.  But not to take control of the show.  It's not your business to do that because you wouldn't do it in a movie theater.  Let me tell you, if she was in a movie theater and she wasn't say, uh, or watching, uh, she  wouldn't dare stand up and throw paint on the screen if she saw something she objected to, or she 
[01:15:00]  wouldn't put her hand in front of the projector so nobody else could see it.  She would just leave.  But because you're in the room with her, people feel entitled to make, you know, their opinion.  Well, that's a difference again, between freedom of speech and censorship.  Censorship, um, isn't turning off your own telly.  That's up to you.  Censorship is making everyone else turn off their telly because you don't like what's on  the telly.  And that's a big difference. 
[01:15:30]  And I think people sometimes get confused with what freedom of speech is, you know, um,  basically I think offense is the collateral damage of freedom of speech.  Some people don't get offended by anything you say somewhere.  Somewhere else will get, you know, they might not, they might not get it.  They might not care for it.  It might be their cup of tea and that's fine, you know, but they have the choice.  You know, I, as a comedian, I don't go around knocking on doors and sitting on people's  surface and shouting my shit at them.  They've come into my world.  They've come into my church. 
[01:16:00]  Do you know?  Yeah.  They're going to hear my sermon.  That was a great way, sorry to not just say that, that was a great way to phrase it.  Offense is the collateral damage of free speech.  That's a really good way to say it.  And people don't understand free speech either.  No, they don't.  They think that means you can do anything.  I say about freedom of speech is, is one of the most important things that we have in  a civilized society, freedom of speech, right?  Um, and I have to explain to them, uh, and I say, why do you block people?  I say, well, that's, that's up to me.  Your freedom of speech isn't your freedom to be heard. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Or, even if you're heard, listened to, or even if you're heard and listened to, taken  seriously.  Okay.  That, that, that, the freedom of speech ends with, with you saying what you want.  And I mean, it's the same principle as you saying that they came to your church.  Like if you're tweeting something out, you don't intend for the world to see it.  You intend for those who follow you to see it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You've come to my door and you've complained about what I'm saying on my sofa.  It's like, just my sofa.  Just leave quietly.  You don't have to do anything. 
[01:17:00]  Just go home.  Just block me, whatever.  Yeah.  Right.  And this is what an idiot says as well about freedom of speech.  And they say, oh, what?  So Hitler was right.  No, because he wasn't saying things, was he?  He was killing people.  Right.  That's not saying, that's doing.  Yeah.  And his intent, his intent was not to make you laugh.  It was to rally people to genocide.  Right.  Big difference.  Of course.  Between that.  Yeah.  And what, uh, genocide is not covered within the boundaries of freedom of speech.  Right. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And, and, you know, if Hitler just went around saying shit, fine.  Yeah.  It's allowed.  If he just went around.  If the worst thing Hitler did was say awful things.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's a bit of an idiot.  I don't want to be his friend.  Right.  But.  He's allowed to say it.  As long as he doesn't put anything into action.  You're okay, Hitler.  Yeah.  You're okay with your funny little moustache.  Don't do anything though, will you?  No.  Okay, because he's illegal.  His first murder.  His first murder.  Oh, you overstepped the mark there, mate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's the line.  Oh.  You did it.  Yeah, but we're talking, you know. 
[01:18:00]  It's another phrase that annoys me as well.  Militant atheist.  Militant atheist.  Uh-huh.  Well, you mean I said stuff.  Right.  That's what, that's what a militant atheist is.  Yeah.  I'm going to go onto a crowded tube station, unbutton my shot, and talk about science and  shit.  Um.  Yeah.  Horrible army.  Yeah.  There's so many things I want people to know.  What militant means, what freedom of speech is, what, what, um, oh, the burden of proof.  People, there are people who tweet me things like, you can't prove God doesn't exist. 
[01:18:30]  No.  No, I can't.  Yes.  Great argument.  No, I say things like, you can't prove Santa doesn't exist.  Like, I know he's ridiculous.  Of course he doesn't.  Well, that's insanity.  It's ridiculous.  Of course he doesn't.  Just a man with a white beard doing shit in that time.  Don't be fucked up bollocks.  You're great on Twitter, man.  You really, I love the fact that as famous as you are and as big as your career is, it's  like, you don't worry about saying the wrong thing and, and you don't, I love that you. 
[01:19:00]  As long as you're honest.  Yeah.  You can't be held accountable, really.  Um, in that, that Tosh, what's his name?  Daniel Tosh?  Yeah, I didn't know about the joke or anything.  I, it was, it was raging and people were asking me, what do you think about Daniel Tosh?  I said, what's happened?  Said, uh, rape joke.  It shouldn't be a rape joke.  There's no, you should never joke.  I said, well, it depends what the joke is.  I'm like, no, of course it doesn't.  You should never rape.  And then someone sent me a tweet and she said, I will laugh at a rape joke the day I know  that no one in that audience has been raped. 
[01:19:30]  And I just tweeted back, what a strange door policy.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know that way.  Two, please.  Uh, certainly, that's, uh, can I just ask you a question?  Have you ever been raped?  I have, yeah.  You can't come in.  I'm sorry.  It's a policy.  It's not me.  No, because there's a woman at the front and she's only going to laugh if she knows that  no one in the audience has been raped.  That was a great one.  Yeah, I remember that very specifically. 
[01:20:00]  But like, but what an ass she is to say that because that means you won't laugh at a drunk  driving joke or you won't laugh at a pedophile joke or you won't laugh at any type of domestic  violence reference.  What, what is a rape joke?  You know, I wouldn't, you know, I'm not, I don't find rape funny.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's one of the worst, hideous things.  Um, but there's so many levels to get.  I mean, technically the door policy joke is a rape joke.  Well, if that's a, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  I think, I think so. 
[01:20:30]  I think, I think they mean the subject of rape as opposed to the, you know, again, if  you're laughing at someone who's been raped, that's not a joke.  Yeah.  That's just, you're a horrible, nasty, but I don't find it funny.  There are some people that would find it funny, but they're serial killers and rapists.  Right.  Okay.  And the thing is, again, stupid people, um, treat jokes about bad things with the same  fear and loathing as intelligent people treat the actual bad thing and they're not related. 
[01:21:00]  You know, a joke about, about that's what humor is for to get us over bad things.  That's exactly what, even loosely speaking, a humor is so, it gets us over bad shit.  If you can't joke about bad shit, there's no point joking about good shit.  Yeah.  Cause we don't need it.  We don't need it.  It's already good.  Everyone likes a balloon.  Who gives a shit?  Laughter is this drug that cures bad shit is a drug is a drug.  It cures good shit.  I don't want that.  Yeah.  I like, I like good shit. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I want some of the cures bad shit.  Well, laughter is the best medicine.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Those people, a lot of them aren't dumb, but a lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them are like dumb is almost letting some of them off.  Some of them are dumb, but some of them are so self-centered in their opinion.  Yeah.  And there's a real self-centeredness that comes with it and a self-importance about what I feel  is appropriate is appropriate and what you feel is appropriate is not.  And I'm the arbiter of that.  Well, they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't like a comedian having this superpower 
[01:22:00]  of freedom of speech and exercising it so well.  Right.  They can't stand it.  I mean, these are the people that go to comedy shows with the intent to catch you doing something  wrong and catch you saying something you weren't supposed to.  So then they can blog about it or they can, you know, tell the world that you shouldn't  be doing what you do.  Yesterday, someone tweeted me, there is a cure for cancer.  It is called praying.  And I sent back your application for chief of oncology at the top school has not been  successful, right?  Sure.  So, so that's a clear joke about how stupid it would be if we took praying as a cure for 
[01:22:30]  cancer seriously, as opposed to all that stuff that cures cancer that we researched, right?  Someone gets involved saying, oh, so you're laughing at the fact there's no cure for cancer.  Nope.  I'm laughing at you because you're a stupid fucking idiot.  Right.  So you don't get what I was saying.  Basically, he's angry on false pretenses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've had it happen to me.  Someone in the paper said, look at this terrible joke and they've done the joke and it's wrong. 
[01:23:00]  They've got the joke wrong.  It's so important.  Every, every aspect of a joke is important.  The syntax, the semantics, the rhyming, sometimes even some of the visual aid that comes with  it.  Taken out of context, it's the better the joke, the more fragile it is.  Well, sarcasm doesn't read in print, you know, um, I'm happy he died, reads terribly  like, oh yeah, I'm happy he died.  There's a tremendous, that was me acting.  There's a tremendous difference and people know that and we have that common, uh, bond 
[01:23:30]  of language, but people, what I hate about people is they pretend they don't know it because  the bigger goal is to get you to not say what they don't like and that's all it is.  Yeah.  And some people, you know, there's, again, there's, there's in a Venn diagram, there'd  be lots and lots of overlaps, but some people are genuinely angry and they don't know why  everyone doesn't find the same things, um, wrong as they do.  Yeah.  Then they just want a retweet.  Then they just don't like you.  Then they just want to say something because no one listens to them.  Yeah.  Ever.  That's often, that's often the case. 
[01:24:00]  It's an excuse to be heard.  Absolutely.  It's an excuse to be heard.  They're frustrated that they're not heard like we are, that they haven't got that platform.  So they want to bring us down a peg or two.  And if they say, if you say you're sorry, and if you've wounded somebody, when people  are wounded, we, well, what's wrong?  Talk.  We'll listen to you now.  Yeah.  People want to pretend that they're wounded by somebody's words.  Well, yeah.  I had many complaints.  You know, I used to work in a public sector.  I used to work at a university and they had a complaint.  And sometimes they just couldn't believe you'd called them back.  They go, oh, thanks.  Don't worry about it.  They wanted to talk to someone.  Yeah.  They wanted to be heard. 
[01:24:30]  And, you know, that's all that.  They were happy.  They were happy.  They, you know, and, uh, um, I think that is the case sometimes.  But I did a, I did a show, Madison Square Garden.  Okay.  So a lot of people, I did jokes about, um, uh, race, the Holocaust, uh, um, uh, Anne Frank  jokes.  Oh, no.  Um, paedophile jokes, everything.  I got a letter from, um, uh, a society saying, oh, we loved your show.  We found it.  Uh, we were very disappointed at the joke about Anne Frank. 
[01:25:00]  Uh, and I, about, about, I said, but you understood.  The satire behind the famine joke, the paedophile joke, the racist joke.  You understood that because it wasn't your thing.  Right.  But you can't get over your thing.  You think, well, why is, you know, I'm the same with some things.  I don't like certain jokes about certain things because I, I can't get over them emotionally.  You know, I don't, uh, uh, but I've got to keep that quiet.  I've just got to, you know, you've got, you've got to take the rough with the smooth, you know. 
[01:25:30]  And you can understand on that intellectual level that if their intent here, here, and  here was not malicious, here it probably wasn't malicious either.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Just because you don't like that being brought up doesn't mean that this guy was trying to  hurt your feelings.  No, exactly.  And that's what it feels like.  That's what offense feels like.  Mm-hmm.  Offense feels that, why is he having a go at me?  And you've got to step back from that and go, well, he's not having a go at me.  He doesn't even know you.  Yeah.  Unless I name you.  Right. 
[01:26:00]  You know, I think that's, that's, that, that, that's one thing I don't do too often.  I don't say, well, one, I, you know, again, it depends what the target of the joke is.  And sometimes even if you name someone, they're not actually the target of the joke.  They're instrumental in getting to the target of the joke.  So I can understand why someone would feel bullied if, God, he just got on stage and  talked about, it's, you, you have to take the personal out of it, I think, you know?  And I think that the better the joke is, the more universal it is. 
[01:26:30]  Or if they admitted what they're really doing.  Like, I would respect people if they said, you said something I don't like, and I really  don't want you to be able to say it.  But there's a, there's a self-centeredness in that honesty that they won't do.  So what they have to do is create, even to themselves, a reason that seems legit.  Well, here's why you shouldn't make fun of race.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  But here's why you shouldn't make fun of drunk drunk.  Everyone has a reason.  No one ever just comes out and says the truth, which is, I don't like it and I don't want  you to say it.  There's an ugliness in that.  Well, I think there are reasons you shouldn't make fun of race because no one can help their 
[01:27:00]  race.  But you can make fun about race.  You can make jokes about race.  Right.  But you shouldn't make, you should, I don't think you should, this is what I'm saying about the  target and the subject are different.  You know, the reason why you shouldn't have a go at anyone for anything, they can't help.  And the reason why real racist jokes aren't funny to me, and not because I'm offended by  them, because they're not true.  As soon as someone says, why do Mexicans da-da-da-da, that fact is usually spurious. 
[01:27:30]  It's not a true fact.  It says there's an injustice to it.  Do you know what I mean?  I do.  I don't know if I agree, but I do know if you agree.  Well, if someone said, why are Swedish people all pedophiles?  My first thought is, they're not.  Oh.  Now I can't laugh whatever the punchline is.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, and Jim wanted to move when you heard that.  I'm going to fucking go for dual citizenship.  So, I think, again, the joke fails. 
[01:28:00]  If every part of it is totally untrue, it's rallying.  And that, to me, would be people wanting to, you'd need them to all agree with that.  Hey, all the Swedish people for it to be funny or get around applause.  And so, it fails purely on a comedic level to me.  Not on a political one.  Do you know what I mean?  I do.  And you're also not saying that people should get it.  The important thing for me is, if somebody, there's certain jokes I don't like, too.  Yeah.  But if, I've never called for anyone to be penalized for them. 
[01:28:30]  And so, I never have a problem with people saying they don't like certain type of jokes.  No.  Or they don't think, like, I had a debate with a feminist, who I actually wound up liking on an FX show.  We talked about rape jokes.  Just saying that like it was a surprise.  I went in there with all the prejudices you would have.  Well, I was surprised, though, because her opinion and mine are vastly different.  And we didn't change each other's opinions.  We had a respectful discussion.  I think I saw it.  I think I saw it.  I think it was, yeah.  It was on, yeah, it was online.  Yeah, it was great.  It was great.  But, you know, the thing was, she wasn't calling for people to be censored. 
[01:29:00]  She had a very tricky argument.  We just didn't see eye to eye.  And the frustrating, everyone comes to a crossroad in a debate where we realize we're not going to change each other's minds.  So, do we say, okay?  But that's when people get angry when we don't get our way and can't change their mind.  As I remember, and I don't want to misquote her, but as I remember, her worry was that, I think she had a term called...  Rape culture?  Rape culture, yeah.  Where the assumption was, if it's all out in the open and it's okay to joke about, it desensitizes people and can cause an environment where rape wasn't so heinous and terrible. 
[01:29:30]  And I don't believe that.  I don't either.  I don't think anyone has ever gone.  I saw a funny rape routine.  I'm going to try it tonight.  Right.  I don't think that's ever happened.  I don't either.  And I think that's a big misconception.  Because we can joke about terrible things that we're somehow condoning it is totally untrue.  And I couldn't find the actual bad things that I joke about more offensive and more disgusting and want them to end more than anyone I ever know. 
[01:30:00]  But that doesn't stop me joking about them.  To me, that's almost what the beauty of being a comic is.  It was like, I did jokes about the beheading in Britain.  And the point was...  Okay, that's too much.  The point of the joke was, it had something to do with the way radical Islam treats women, which was negative.  But people, like you said, they grow up. 
[01:30:30]  Well, of course.  The minute they hear...  Because I need to hear the joke.  Yeah, you need to hear it.  You need to hear it.  Exactly.  It depends.  And as you said, you joked about it.  And that's the important thing.  At no point do I imagine you ever condoned that act of violence.  No, and people read sarcasm.  And people, you know, it's like a lot of times...  And there's been times where I've said things that I didn't sincerely mean.  But a lot of times the joke is in the ludicrousness of the opinion.  Of course.  Like people know...  And every reasonable person knows that you don't mean that. 
[01:31:00]  It's like if you say your dick is eight feet long.  Nobody actually says...  No, it's not.  And means it literally.  They're fucking morons.  Well, some people are morons.  Some people don't understand it.  And I do that.  And as I say, you sort of play a slight character.  And I think people get to know the thing you're playing.  I started with stand-up and on TV playing a character that I'd said all the wrong things.  But everyone knew that, you know.  I came down politically on the wrong side.  I say things like, Nelson Mandela, what a great man.  It used to get a round of applause. 
[01:31:30]  Just saying that got a round of applause in the right audiences.  They just clapped his name.  And I went, incarcerated for 25 years.  He's been out now about 20 years.  And he hasn't re-offended.  I think he's going straight.  Which shows you prison does work.  But they knew that was wrong.  They knew that was back to front week on stage.  I get it.  He's misunderstanding.  You know, so they understand some things.  But it's not their thing.  Right.  It's not their thing. 
[01:32:00]  The whole thing.  That's just so weird about what's happened with the internet.  Because you would think.  You're putting out so much content on the internet now.  And you would think that that would be the ultimate sort of, this is where I put my stuff.  If you like my stuff, here's the link to it.  If you don't like it, you never have to click it.  You never have to see it.  It's not on your TV.  It's not going to pop up at you.  And none of that's ever going to happen.  But people, even more so than anywhere else, seek out what they don't like so they can write a comment, so they can tweet you some nonsense.  But they think everything's personal, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Basically, Twitter, if you follow someone, you've got to imagine that you're standing by a notice board in the middle of a big town.  And someone comes up and puts up guitar lessons, right?  And then they're standing there and go, but I don't want to learn guitar.  Well, no, it's not actually a, I don't want to learn guitar.  I want to learn banjo.  I don't do, oh, that fucks.  Until they forget that they're standing by the notice board in the middle of a big town. 
[01:33:00]  Right, just keep walking, you'll find banjo lessons somewhere.  There might be a banjo lesson somewhere, I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, why tell me that?  I wasn't talking to you, honestly, I wasn't talking to you.  So, yeah, everyone takes everything personally.  And everyone thinks that what they care about is what everyone should care about.  Right.  And that's a given.  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, this is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  My name is E-Rock, and yes, this is the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  And we've got a lot of cool things airing.  We still have a lot more to go on today's show.  Plus, next week, many more days, many more content, much more gooder for you, the listening audience.  In this segment, Anthony Bourdain comes back on the show.  Anthony seems to have become somewhat of a regular.  We have a good time.  He has really amazing stories every time he's on. 
[01:34:00]  He's in promoting his new show, Parts Unknown, on CNN.  It's a great series.  If you haven't checked it out, you really need to go check that out.  I know I've said that about Derek with Ricky Gervais and other things.  But definitely, you should check these things out, people.  Educate yourself a little bit.  Get some culture.  Watch this show, Parts Unknown, on CNN.  And he tells us some stories about his travels.  Of course, good food, good eating, and everything that just makes Anthony Bourdain the fucking man.  This is ONA's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[01:34:30]  I've been seeing you on buses all week.  Yeah, I know.  It's kind of creepy.  It's nice, though.  It's weirding on my daughter, too.  She's like, Daddy, are you looking at me?  Oh, is it?  Everywhere she goes, there's your face, and it's just kind of odd.  It's bad.  Too much of that shit, you start talking about yourself in the third person.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's never a good thing.  The show getting a lot of heat.  The ATV footage was everywhere.  Yeah, that hurt.  Yeah, huh? 
[01:35:00]  Bad luck on ATVs.  Yeah, yeah, that's like, what, your second run-in?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.  Yeah, I was watching, and I'm like, you're going really fast, first of all.  Right.  And going through water and everything, which to me seems, you know, that's that unknown  factor.  I'd been out in the sun for like four hours to get these shots, and I'm cooking.  I mean, it's really hot.  The sun's coming down.  I'm dehydrated.  I'm drinking beer.  Where was this? 
[01:35:30]  This was in a remote area of Colombia along the Venezuelan border, and yeah, I took a  tight turn and went over, and I mean, I just sort of drove my skull right into the ground.  I mean, my crew tells me I ran over my head.  I didn't, I wasn't awake for that.  But I remember I just felt so stupid that I was like, I got to get up and appear like  nothing happened, because I really don't want to hear the I told you so's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the first thing people normally do, is like, all right, let me get up and make  it seem like nothing happened.  Right.  I'll just, you know, ah, yeah, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
[01:36:00]  And then meanwhile, you know, you're not fine.  No, no, I'm fine.  You know, pardon me while I...  What was the injury?  What was the injury?  Was it a concussion?  I was out for a second, but, you know.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, you got thrown.  I hate that feeling.  That just, boom.  It's that fast, violent, you know, something's not right thing.  Not having control, right?  Not quite, you haven't quite figured it out yet.  Like, what am I doing here?  Yeah.  What happened?  I just went straight in, and it was like a pile drive, like straight, my head first 
[01:36:30]  straight into the ground.  Yeah.  If there were a comic book noise, it would have been something like a skronk.  Yeah.  Ozzy almost died doing that fucking, I know, right?  I know, right?  ATVs are rough, man.  The first ATV accident I had, like, who gets to use that?  And I said, so the first time.  Yeah.  I was on, I think, Jimmy Kimmel, and I showed that clip, and Ozzy was the other guest, and  he's sitting next to me.  Oh, wow.  And after the show, he followed me around backstage for, like, 45 minutes, like this  doddering grandmother saying, Anthony, Anthony, don't do that again. 
[01:37:00]  Anthony, you could have died.  He said, Anthony, come here.  But he grabbed my hand and running it along his collarbone so I could feel all the plates  in there.  Feel his injury.  Oh, he's got plates?  Yeah.  He was personally, like, horrified by this thing.  And just, he was, he just took it upon himself to, you know, bring me back to the light.  You know what the thing about ATVs are, too?  You get on, you start riding, and at first, you're kind of cautious, you're feeling it  out.  But in no time, you really think you have it down. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Like, because you start going a little faster, you know, you get your balls, and you're like,  yeah, this is good.  And meanwhile, you haven't been riding the thing more than 20 minutes.  You've gone from, you know, very slow, just figuring it out, to now you're a pro, going  off jumps, going through water, taking tight turns, sliding.  Yeah.  It's like, no, you're not good.  No.  This thing is overpowering you.  And then you got in the back of your head, you got to get some good footage for the TV  show.  Well, that, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was that. 
[01:38:00]  Were you driving worse than you should have because you knew the camera was rolling?  Probably a little bit.  Compared to what?  I suck.  I mean, I shouldn't be on one.  Like, oh, man.  What other, any other catastrophes during the show?  During that one?  No.  You know, we have a Libya show coming up, which is the best thing I've ever done.  I mean, it was awesome.  And then I think since I saw you guys last, the Congo, which was the hardest show we've  ever done.  Yeah, huh?  What made the Congo hard?  There's probably an obvious answer there. 
[01:38:30]  There's 29 different rebel groups.  Right.  And, you know, just shit goes wrong at every turn.  I mean, it's a country without really much infrastructure.  And the worst case scenario, like if things go wrong, like you're robbed or extorted or  something, or you get a flat tire and you find yourself in the middle of a robbery  and extortion is in the same category as a flat.  The worst case scenario is that the cops or the army come to help you out.  Oh, really?  Then it gets really bad.  Why is that bad?  They're pretty good at, you know, rape and murder are pretty much, you know, the specialty. 
[01:39:00]  For the cops and the military?  Bad.  Really bad.  So if they come to help you, are you saying that they're-  It's the worst thing that could possibly happen.  Jesus.  They're not going to help you.  They're professionals that will rob you.  Look, a rebel dude wants to take your stuff.  If you could say, I mean, I guess you could say, fuck you, I'm not giving it to you, and  you could run.  Or you could, you know, maybe punch somebody and make a break for it.  I mean, not that that would be a good idea.  But when the, an official, I mean, the army have, they've stolen the diplomatic bag from 
[01:39:30]  like the ambassador, I think the French ambassadors, I forget which one.  But I mean, they just don't have any problem with all of, you know, you're giving me that.  And if you fight back, you're, you know-  Now it's an official problem.  You're going to put you in jail forever.  That's probably not a good jail either.  I bet a jail in the Congo?  Oh, my God.  I bet it's not, you can't really protest for better conditions.  It is probably, it is, natural resource-wise, it's the wealthiest country in Africa.  It's the size of all Western Europe. 
[01:40:00]  It's beautiful.  It's a very, very, very, very complicated situation.  But it really, it was an adventure and I got to say a privilege to see it.  But how do you, how do you stay safe?  It's, look, it's dangerous.  Yeah, there's no, no guarantees, eh?  It's a place where the situation changes from minute to minute, where everything, you know,  you just got to be really careful.  You don't carry arms.  You drive around in bands with TV written on the side and a big sign with an AK, like a 
[01:40:30]  silhouette of an AK with a red circle and a line.  Right, that you don't have any weapons.  We do not have any weapons, so nothing to see here, folks, nothing particularly good  to steal.  You don't, you don't travel with armed security.  That just isn't going to.  Why is that?  Because it, it makes.  There's 29 different official rebel groups.  Those are the ones with names.  Oh, shit.  And then these guys called Mai Mai, who are local defense forces.  You just make yourself a big fat target if you, if you're, if you're in any way armed. 
[01:41:00]  I mean, you have security people, you have local fixers who sort of, you know, the idea  is to argue your way out of a situation, finesse your way out of a situation.  There's a lot of.  You did have a fixer?  You didn't.  Yeah.  You have to have Congolese who are looking after you, who know, okay, this guy needs  10 minutes of FaceTime, a lot of handshakes, and maybe a fruit basket.  This is, this guy's a problem.  Time to get in the van and, you know, get out of here.  Wow.  Like, who is the problem?  Would it be like a local chief or?  Local security, whoever the sinister local, you know, head of the internal security ministry 
[01:41:30]  is, but a lot of ministries, I don't like a place with ministries.  What's weird, though, is like, even in the middle, we're up in, uh, what was essentially  in the book, the heart of darkness, you know, where Kurtz was, and we're about a hundred  clicks out of there, middle of the jungle, no power anywhere, nothing resembling running  water, five bars on a cell phone, Fiji, Fiji, tweeting from the middle of the jungle. 
[01:42:00]  Holy shit.  That's pretty amazing.  We would love our friend Jonathan, right?  Oh, yeah, my manager goes to, he's never been in the Congo, but he goes to crazy, uh, takes  crazy trips, he's obsessed with travel, and he's got the same kind of view you do, like,  he just wants to see these places, and he doesn't go in armed, he doesn't, you know,  he just, he took a tour of Africa recently, and, you know, just, he said the driving was  the worst part, because you get motion sick, because the roads are so fucking twisted, and 
[01:42:30]  the infrastructure is just non-existent.  Yeah, you get the tenderized kidneys.  He didn't go where Anthony went, though.  He didn't go like that.  It was, it was, like, an amazing, amazing experience.  And where'd you end up filming in the Congo?  Oh, man, everything.  I mean, uh, Goma, you know, we start out in Goma in the eastern Kivu, which is very contentious  area, and then sort of centered on Conrad, Apocalypse Now, the Heart of Darkness, and  the, kind of, took a look at the history of the Congo, through the Congo River, and- 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  It's a lot of history to try and discuss in a visual way, because most people look at  the Congo, and they just throw their hands up in the air, and they say, you know, it's  too much, I can't, you know, how do you explain this in three minutes, much less 42 minutes?  Mm-hmm.  Um, so, you know, we try to do that, and in a visual way, that's, but, um...  Is it, is it scary when you, you said that you have a handler, and, like, these guys are 
[01:43:30]  talking to the local guy, and you don't know if they're being, you know, because other times  in the language barrier, you don't know if they're screaming at each other?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is that just how these guys talk, or is there a problem?  You get used to that really quick, but there is a lot of screaming and threats.  Jesus.  That's called negotiation.  Sounds exhausting.  You know, him, arrest him, you know, that sort of thing.  But your guy would say to you, like, all right, we can't fix this.  How did you know that you weren't going to be stopped when the guy goes, like, hey, this guy's a problem?  Look, there were a lot of moments where this situation is bad and these are our options. 
[01:44:00]  You know, make a run for it or, you know, land or a river, you know.  But we had really, really great fixers who were just really good at going through the process, meaning there's a screaming, yelling, and threats process.  Then there's a talk them down process.  Then there's, you know, we'll have some warm beer and maybe some money will be exchanged.  A little negotiating.  But what were they mad about?  You came to, you talked to the mayor first. 
[01:44:30]  You didn't come right to me first.  The mayor got a fruit basket, and I'm putting him in jail.  You know, you should have come to me first.  Wow.  Putting you in jail?  Or the mayor?  Well, where's the mayor?  It's like management here.  Generally, the mayor goes first.  And then I can guarantee your safety, you know, which is not a good thing to hear.  No.  Is that a threat almost?  Because it's not just not guaranteeing your safety.  We're going to make it very difficult.  Yeah, we're going to do it ourselves.  I can guarantee your safety is definitely not what you want to hear where we were.  So there's no right answer. 
[01:45:00]  Obviously.  You're always pissing off somebody.  Yeah.  Also, you were in a situation where any state employee probably hasn't been paid anything in six months.  There were guys showing up at the train station and kissing on you.  I don't think it's been fully operational, if operational at all, since like early 60s and only partially operational since the 70s.  Oh, my God.  Their whole staff shows up, and I mean, the whole train station's overrun.  The tracks are overrun, everything. 
[01:45:30]  They show up every day, and they do their job.  They try to keep the trains repaired every day with no money.  The guys who show up at this bouldering library in the middle of the jungle, they show up hoping.  They just show up to work.  They put on their jacket, they tie, they go in.  There's a library there?  We went to this Belgian research center in the middle of the jungle.  It was pretty awesome.  Wow.  It was really, really wild. 
[01:46:00]  What's the library like?  Huge, like, futurist, kind of, you know, Futurama-style library complex that thousands of people used to work at, out in the middle of the jungle, most of it overgrown completely.  You see a lot of that.  I mean, you see the hotel where Bogart and Bacall and Catherine Hepburn stayed during the African Queen.  You know, it used to be a really beautiful, industrialized wonderland for white people, you know, in the Congo. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, the Congolese weren't allowed to walk their own streets.  But if you were a middle-class Belgian, you were living large in the Congo.  You had railways and modern buildings and infrastructure, sports club, you know, the pool, the health, you know, the golf courses, all of that.  And, you know, when they split, the Belgians, they plugged the toilets with cement, scuttled everything in sight.  And since they hadn't allowed anyone to, you know, go beyond, I think, like, middle school, you know, they left, like, eight qualified guys in the whole Congo to run a country. 
[01:47:00]  What year did the Belgians leave?  Early 60s.  Why were they such pieces of shit about it?  Uh, man, they were not, uh, it, before the Belgians, the whole country was owned by King Leopold of Belgium.  And he basically, uh, killed half the population, uh, pushing them to collect rubber and ivory.  And if you didn't bring in your quota for rubber, um, by hand tapping it and extracting, cut your arms off. 
[01:47:30]  Jesus.  Their people were paid by the arm.  This was in the 20th century.  It's kind of like kicking over you at the sandcastle before you leave the beach.  Right.  Not uncommon.  A lot of, a lot of guys in Africa, a lot of, I mean, it wasn't just the Belgians.  Also, to be fair, uh, the, the, the Congolese, as soon as they got independence, uh, you know, made this mistake of, uh, democratically electing basically a communist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who we quickly had killed. 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  Us and the British and, uh, the Belgians.  And, uh, so we were not too eager to see them succeed, particularly given the large uranium deposits in the country, which we did not want to fall in the hands of the Russians.  So, you know, it did not make us unhappy at that particular period of time that the country was not working.  So without the colonialism there now and stuff, what is the issue now?  They're surrounded, uh, they're bristling with diamonds, gems, uh, natural resources, uh, that everybody wants. 
[01:48:30]  They've got neighbors like Rwanda with huge displaced, uh, uh, armies who've been kicked out of Rwanda now running around in the Congo, um, because the last president, any president actually, they can't rely on their own army.  Anytime they have problems within the country, they make a lot, they basically rent out or sell off their national resources to neighbors, uh, neighboring countries who send in armies to ally with the current president, uh, and then hang around and make sure that they get to keep stuff. 
[01:49:00]  So there are all of these surrogate armies controlled by the neighbors as well as all these little breakaway groups who one minute, you know, 10 minutes ago were working with the army and the national government and are now allied against them.  Have you ever thought like, what's the solution here?  What would be the solution to get a, a viable world, world accepted, uh, uh, country there?  It's so big. 
[01:49:30]  That's the problem.  I mean, it's a thick, the size of all Western Europe.  Yeah.  Capital and most of its jungle.  So it's really, really hard.  Um, look, they need a, they need a large functioning management class for sure.  Uh, but you know, we can hardly pull that off in this country.  You said something back there that everything's being overgrown.  Yeah.  That must've been really cool to say.  It's, it's, it's hauntingly beautiful.  Right.  Uh, to see, you know. 
[01:50:00]  And the Bogart hotel where they stayed.  Yeah.  That's one of the places that's completely overgrown.  It's a squat now, but it was called the poor qua pa hotel.  And I'm reading Hepburn's memoir as I'm, you know, looking at it.  Yeah.  Did you go inside of it?  Yeah.  And it's just being overgrown.  Uh, well, I mean, there's squatters living in it.  Wow.  Jeez.  And that library is not used for anything anymore, right?  There's, that's just.  Well, no, there are a few, you know, there are still a few, um, a few Congolese, uh, students 
[01:50:30]  who were trying to make use of that research.  And, um, it's heartbreaking.  You know, people are trying, but it's really, really tough.  That's a situation where you fight to live every day.  And, uh, has that given you a, uh, like, how has it changed your perspective of the United  States at all?  Uh, when you see stuff like that and it's stuff that, I mean, only a small percentage of people  in America would even see that, uh, how has it changed your, your, you know, if I hear  somebody whining about writer's block, you know, I'm not too sympathetic. 
[01:51:00]  Right, right.  When you see how hard people will work just to stay clean, you know, how, how, how, how  hard they'll work to just to, you know, maintain their pride, clean clothes, clean body, you  know, that's, uh, uh, it's not what you expect.  Does it give you more patience here?  Do you, are you more patient with things or you, you, you, you're, you're thinking that  there, you know, when the ferry goes out and it's another seven hour away to get across 
[01:51:30]  the river and that's every day.  Right, right.  You know, you think, you know, I'm never going to yell at a traffic light again.  Yeah.  The one minute that it's taking, God damn it.  I missed the light.  So we've been mixing it, you know, I mean, look how easy I got it.  I mean, they're okay.  We're bitching about, okay.  Oh God, if I just, just one, one, one toilet, you know, one, one good shower.  Right, right.  Um, you know, but that's for what a week, 10 days, the next show I'll be in Spain, you  know, eating tapas and drinking red wine. 
[01:52:00]  Are you taking a lot of shits outdoors?  Yeah, we're professionals, man.  We, uh, you're real good at, uh, you know, all of these things you never thought you'd have  to learn.  We're getting real good at, yeah.  The alfresco dump.  Yes, the alfresco dump, yes.  Do you ever think like, I'm going to this place and, uh, I've, I've, I've overstepped  this time.  We made, we made a mistake thinking we were going to be safe and we are, I mean, I know  you have a lot of scary moments, but has there been any times where you're like, I really 
[01:52:30]  fucked up this time?  Me, no.  Uh, there were some, there were some days in Libya.  There were some time because there was stuff going on around us.  I mean, it wasn't like, oh my God, we're going to die.  But this situation was getting worse every day and there was a lot of discussion whether  to stay or go.  Like every day there were, there was an emergency meeting.  Okay.  This is the latest security briefing and our security guys were not, you know, when your 
[01:53:00]  security guys are saying, look, if we'd known before what we know now, we wouldn't have come.  We would have advised you not to come.  That's great, man.  And so every day it was sort of like the whole crew had a vote or are we bugging out for the  airport or are we going to try to hang on for another few days?  How would you vote?  I, I voted to stay.  I mean, I felt pretty sick.  I'm not a heroic guy by a long shot, but I didn't see any immediate, it looked okay to 
[01:53:30]  me.  The people around us were cool.  The Libyans were very cool with us.  There was stuff happening outside of our view that was, that was worrying.  Like we talked to, we have the vice guys in sometimes and, and, uh, and I love their  documentaries and Shane was saying that that's the worst place of all the places.  The scariest was, was Juarez, Mexico.  Yeah.  Uh, would you go there?  Would you go to certain places in Mexico at this point?  Or do you think you might want to avoid that?  I don't know.  It would, it depends on what the, what the situation is.  I'm not looking to put, unlike them, I'm not looking to put my head up into a firing 
[01:54:00]  line just for good TV.  I mean, that's, I'm there for another reason.  And I'm willing to accept a certain amount of risk if there's a really good story or  something interesting there, but I'm not looking at, you know, Hey, look at me.  I'm in Juarez.  Right, right, right.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, I love, I love Mexico.  So, I mean, I'd love if, if you tell me, if enough people tell me it'll be okay.  We've been to a lot of places where they say you shouldn't go that turn out to be really 
[01:54:30]  cool.  When you're, when you're in these places, like, uh, do you come back here and, and see  news from the Congo and from Libya and does it affect you more in that way?  Do you have to carry this around with you now going, you know, not only feeling bad for  your own country and what's happening here, but now you gotta, you gotta have empathy  for like half the fucking globe.  I don't know.  You know, it's, it's, uh, it's weird.  You, you steal your heart to a lot of things.  That's what I assume.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really.  You, you, you have to, I mean, I've seen this happen with NGOs and people who work in 
[01:55:00]  environments like that, you know, just in order to get to work every day without having  a breakdown, constantly weeping, you, you, you inure yourself to certain things.  I get angry seeing really stupid coverage of places like Libya.  Um, you know, no clue, you know, they're actually idiots out there saying, you know,  we were better off with Gaddafi.  Oh, really?  You know, really?  Uh, it, it is a, people say this with authority, having never been to Libya, never having met these 
[01:55:30]  kids, the majority of people who overthrew, they, they get their news sources, the most,  you know, cretinous, uh, you know, fringe on, you know, under-informed conspiracy.  Yeah.  And they're pretty, you know, Gaddafi, and they're, and this is from both left and right,  you know, oh, Gaddafi was better.  No, no, he wasn't.  And the majority of the people who, who threw him out were people that you would like hanging  out with, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool. 
[01:56:00]  There were kids who were, you know, playing like a PlayStation, you know, a week before  they, they went to war, uh, went home, you know, from Western universities to, to fight  against the guy.  I mean, you know, they fought Soviet tanks with handmade weapons built out of like, uh,  plastic and hair dryers.  So, yeah, I got a lot of, it, you know, it made, when I see really stupid, uh, uninformed  news coverage, it makes me a little cranky.  And, and, and much like, uh, soldiers and, and police officers and whatnot, and you don't 
[01:56:30]  have to be specific, but were there, were the, was there some form of gallows humor a  little between you guys to just see some horrible things and, and in order to even deal with  it, have to, you know, make a little, you reach this, you reach this stupid zone where  yes, you know, it's, it's like, uh, to cope, coping mechanism.  Well, you just start like getting getally obsessed with getting getally raped, you know, it's 
[01:57:00]  like everything, you know, look who laughs first, Jimmy.  Yes.  Yes.  I've never actually laughed thinking, but I always come.  It is, it is, uh, you know, it's a constant remain, especially when you're sort of, you  know, when you're taught, you're really tired and you've been running, going, going, going,  you're stressed, you're scared.  Uh, you're reading, you know, you're reading news reports of just like unbelievably awful  shit.  Yes.  You make stupid, uh, and wildly inappropriate. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  Right.  No doubt about it.  What do you, what do you, where do you go on personal vacations?  Like, where do you like going around, around the world?  Look, any beach where I can just stay put, uh, is good for me.  Nice beverage on the beach.  Summer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just hang out with the family and then I'm not doing anything, you know, I'm walking  to the barbecue in the bed back.  That's about it.  That's, uh, because yeah, your work puts you in a position when you're vacationing, you're 
[01:58:00]  not the, uh, Hey, excursion guy.  You're not fucking, let's, let's do this and steamers, beer.  That's it.  Nice.  But the people he goes with, they're all hoping he comes up with a plan for that  day.  Yeah.  We're laying here on the lounge chair with a drink in my hand.  He's going to come up with the, the excursion.  Hell no.  I'm going to my family and it's like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not social at all.  I don't, I don't, summer I'm not about, uh, going to benefits or, uh, any of that shit.  I'm not, I don't know.  You just want to relax and kind of stay put. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  If it's a, if there's a meal that I can't eat with my hands, it's a disaster.  It's a personal disaster.  If I have to put on, you know, anything other than a bathing suit, then it's, something's  gone seriously wrong in my vacation.  How, how old were you when you first started like traveling on your own?  Really?  So you were just pretty much a homebody kind of a guy?  No, I was working in restaurants 14 hours a day.  Well, yeah.  But I mean, I hadn't been, I'd been to France for a couple of summers, a few weeks out of  a few summers.  I'd been in the Caribbean a few times.  That was, that was about it. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  So yeah, big, big, uh, big change for me.  So it was, you know, work that took you, uh, around the globe.  Well, I mean, I made sure I, I worked to make sure that that was my work.  You know, I said, look, you know, the book's doing really well.  Um, I got to cash in on this.  I got to, you know, I, I, I made a success by writing about my life and I only got one of  those.  So you got to make some more of it.  You know, got to get somebody to send me out there to have adventures and do all the 
[01:59:30]  shit I always wanted to do.  And then hopefully I'll have something to write about.  And that ended up being, uh, you know, 13 years later, um, I'm still doing it.  You like colder climates or warmer climates better?  I'm a warm, I don't like, I hate clean, orderly countries, you know, Switzerland would be a  living hell to me.  I hate Alpine vistas, clean streets, functioning, crime-free societies.  I like hot, messy, dysfunctional, passionate societies where people yell at each other  and serve delicious, spicy food. 
[02:00:00]  That's just the opposite of what I like.  That's more exciting.  Really?  Yeah.  I'd rather be in like Sweden than, than like Southern Italy.  Oh yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Well, I'm a Southern Italy.  I would, I would mind Italy.  Italy's, I'm thinking of, of, of disorganized places.  I mean, I, I like a nice, I like a nice clean street.  He likes a clean street.  He likes a hotel that has 24 hour room service.  Yeah.  Gentleman's accommodations is what I say.  Yeah.  I mean, look, I like a good, I like some good plumbing, but, but, uh, you know, clean 
[02:00:30]  streets.  I, I, I can hear the jackboots coming, you know what I mean?  It's a wherever, you know what I mean?  Is there a place you haven't been yet that you want to be?  Iran.  I'd love to go to Iran.  Iran.  If the government is, uh, you know, we'll, we'll see how that goes.  You probably can get, isn't it?  Oh, you can go in.  I just, uh, if they loosen up a little bit right now, it's a kind of, it's a hostile  environment to say the least, but the people are supposed to be awesome.  The country is supposed to be great.  It's supposed to be easy to get around there.  The people are lovely.  The food's amazing.  It's a beautiful place. 
[02:01:00]  It's just a really fucked up, uh, uh, government.  I've, I've heard the youth of Iran loves America.  They're young.  It's a very young country.  I think the majority, the vast majority of the population are under 28.  And they really like what we do here in America, but for some reason they can't figure  that out.  Get some of that going over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's a, it's a tough situation.  What about North Korea?  Would you like to go there?  I think it would be poor taste to go do a, you know, I mean, I'm known for food shows  and there's not a lot of food there. 
[02:01:30]  Uh, they're not going to let me see much interesting, you know, you get these handlers of situations  like that who are, you know, look at glorious buildings of revolution.  Oh yeah.  Sir.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  This is hilariously bad.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Must share moments.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues. 
[02:02:00]  Opie and Anthony, and, uh, you just heard Anthony Bourdain, but now we're going into  Jim Brewer, another one of our favorites.  Jim has been a regular, a fan, a friend of this show for many, many years.  And over the years we've seen Jim grow, not just comically, but as a person, a family man  and, uh, Jim's back in studio.  And now he's talking something that we never really saw the side of Jim.  He's talking a little bit of politics.  He's talking about gun control, gun rights, and of course he's discussing all of this 
[02:02:30]  with Anthony Cumia.  This is a bizarre segment just to hear serious topics being discussed like this with Jim Brewer.  The worst of 2013.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That's why I don't even watch, I don't watch the news.  It's so, it's, it's like gun laws.  I mean, if you, everyone should have a right to have a gun.  I think a gun, bang, bang, bang, that's a gun.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  That's a suspect.  Exactly.  That's what I say.  That's a suspect.  Unless you're in the military or you're hunting, there's no reason for that.  No one can have a machine gun.  You can't have a machine gun.  You really can't.  And at the end of the day, this is the news.  They'll say, I would sit, some of my friends are so Fox News oriented, it drives me, oh,  this is how the Nazis did.  I go, what are you talking about?  This is how the Nazis. 
[02:03:30]  I'm like, no.  The last I heard, the Nazis would knock on the door and be like, does your name Endenstein?  They're not looking, like, what are you talking about?  Or they'll say, I get so rallied, I feel bad for people when they go, it's the Constitution.  All right.  Like, are you retarded?  Yep.  They wore fucking wigs and tights when they wrote up the Constitution.  It took 40 minutes on a guy on a fucking horse to shoot somebody. 
[02:04:00]  There were no cars.  You had to get on a horse, you had to put fucking gunpowder and stick it in there, chase this  fucker, fixing your wig, because the bouncing of the horse was fucking your wig up.  Then you had to fix your tights, and then the gun would go up by accident, and it took  another 20 minutes to fucking get this guy to reload.  So that whole not, and then there's, and they go, well, our government's taking over. 
[02:04:30]  That argument makes me absolutely...  It is an asshole argument.  It's beyond an asshole argument.  Like, did you watch Boston?  Did you see what happened when the so-called bomber, which is another fucking thing, the  bomber...  Dude.  All right, I'm going to get started here.  I love it.  For 24 straight hours, they go, I hear me, and here comes the SWAT truck, and there's 
[02:05:00]  14 SWAT people, and they show the same video of the fucking SWAT truck, and here are the  dogs.  And then they would have the helicopters, and I sat there watching, going, oh man, they  got those heat-seeking helicopters.  It's over.  And then, like, okay, we're running over here, and then they...  Oh, running over here.  And then they're going, I don't know what's going on over there, but they're all going  over there.  That's how the news guys were. 
[02:05:30]  There's the helicopter, it's circling up.  It's been 24 hours, he was shot in the jugular.  How do you get shot in a fucking neck?  The dogs can't sniff you out.  Nobody can find...  My kid comes out of the pool with a stubbed toe, and I can see where this little fucking  yo-yo went all the way into the bedroom, not cleaning off their toe.  Like, I can see you came out of the pool, you fucking stubbed your toe here, you walked 
[02:06:00]  all the way to the new carpet, into your fucking bedroom, and in the bed, I can see your stupid  stubbed toe.  This guy's hitting a jugglier.  And the dog, there are going more SWAT teams and more dogs.  And they're, and they're, fucking, no one's allowed to have to see, like, old people coming  out of the house, and they're like, let's go!  My dog has to...  Get down!  Get back in the house!  You're going to be a suspect!  My dog!  Get down!  Get down! 
[02:06:30]  They got an old lady, and she's down on the floor, and they got the M16s to her face!  Yeah.  And then, okay.  And then they show the same video.  Here's them walking around the corner again.  Obviously, the younger guy is following the older brother.  He's obviously the leader.  Let's look at that video one more time for the 1700,000th time.  Here's the older brother, there's the younger brother.  Here's the older brother, here's the younger brother. 
[02:07:00]  This is moments before the bomb.  No one has these fucking guys dropping a bomb, walking a bomb, walking away.  But they got 18 million videos of walking around a corner.  No other fucking video.  Then, they let it all go.  Okay, we're releasing it.  We can't find him.  He's in the boat, in the backyard.  Does anyone watch fucking Cops?  Like, he said it wasn't even...  It was straight as it ran up back here. 
[02:07:30]  Every Cops video is like, ah, he's under the fucking pool.  The pool.  He's under the raft.  He's under a bush.  All right, I'm not going to get into it.  What I'm getting into is the whole...  That's very suspect.  When people...  When I watched that, that made me, again, look at yo-yos that are into it.  Like, you can't take my guns away because the government takes over.  So, the government's going to take over and you're going to hold them off? 
[02:08:00]  Did you see what happened in Boston, you fucking retort?  Yeah.  Mr. Educated, watch Fox News 24-7 with your degree.  Oh, you don't know what's going on in this country.  Really?  Okay, your M-16 is going to hold off that fucking army.  Army.  And that was just one town.  And at the end of the day, if you're that packed, it's going to be some kid who's 18 going like this on a computer.  Okay, mission accomplished, sir. 
[02:08:30]  And you're going to be sitting there with your whole arsenal going,  Do you hear bottle rocket?  What the hell sounds like a bottle...  Making accomplished.  And then the other stupid thing is...  What were they...  I was just listening to this three days ago at someone's house.  And I just...  I'm silent because I just watch these idiots argue with each other.  And they don't even...  It's not even common sense. 
[02:09:00]  It's just watching news.  If you watch Fox News, you see NBC, they teach you how to argue each other.  They teach you how to argue each other.  There's no common sense.  Well, let's go to our speech.  On the one hand, you got this opinion.  And on the other hand, you have this opinion.  And in this opinion...  So you're already going, yeah, I feel it.  Yeah, that's how I feel.  You fucking morons.  That's how I feel.  That's exactly...  All right, answer that question, Mrs. Specialist.  And so then, the other one gets me nuts. 
[02:09:30]  Well, China is going to take over.  And this is...  What if we're taking over?  If America's taking over, can you imagine?  God forbid, we're taking over.  Taken over.  We're invaded.  Oh, wow, okay.  We're invaded.  They got past our amazing, intelligent military that found the fucking Boston bomber 24 hours  by a neighbor.  Wasn't even... 
[02:10:00]  The military didn't find him.  The fucking neighbor said, I think there's some blood gushing out the boat.  Well, I should say, he wasn't even saying, there's some blood out in the back.  Out in the backyard.  Whatever the fucking Boston people talk.  I think you might want to look into that.  Some red liquid's coming out of my Boston whaler.  My whaler.  Someone's fucking with my whaler in the yard. 
[02:10:30]  My dog's licking the outside of my whaler.  He's got blood all over it.  I haven't seen no dead rabbits.  And so, if you're sitting there, our intelligence, our amazing military that was all over that  couldn't stop that, couldn't catch them.  Yeah.  They can't stop whoever's going to infiltrate us.  Then our local police force takes over.  They can't stop them.  Do you think Jed in Tennessee and Bob in Jersey with your... 
[02:11:00]  Oh, thank God for the gun law.  I got my...  Tony on Long Island?  Yeah, Tony on Long Island.  Gonna stop...  That's me.  Fum-duck you.  Fum-duck you.  Vladimir and whoever, who has just already crushed everyone.  This ain't Red Dawn in the 90s.  Patrick Swayze ain't gonna help you, you retards.  People are retarded when they watch the fucking news.  So anyway, I don't know how I got into that. 
[02:11:30]  They're...  Very funny, man.  Well, I do have a couple of responses.  Please.  Please.  I do have a couple of responses.  Please.  And, of course, I don't think there's anyone in their right mind that would assume that  a bunch of people with whatever weapons are legally available to the American public these  days can fend off the United States military.  Correct.  I never thought that.  I don't think that's actually the point. 
[02:12:00]  Correct.  What I think the point is, is that an armed public cannot be taken over with a swipe of  the pen, in more of a figurative term, but here it is.  You're not looking to defeat the United States Army with your guns at home.  Sure.  But...  Yes.  If the United States military, and the government leading that military, knows it has to fire  upon its people, because its people will shoot back at them, it negates the country. 
[02:12:30]  The country's gone at that point.  So then what is the government actually holding onto at that point?  You know what I mean?  You can't open fire on a huge number of American people because they're shooting back at you.  Now, if the American people have no weapons, it's very easy to just legislate your will  upon them, and take away people's rights and whatnot.  It's not winning.  The thing is, if you even get into a battle with the American people, you lose. 
[02:13:00]  You instantly lose.  You've lost the country.  You've lost everything the country supposedly stands for.  And there's no more free United States of America.  And there is one now?  I know.  You can talk about what it is now and everything.  I understand that.  I don't think it's free now either.  And I think they can legislate against you.  In small pockets of resistance like Waco and whatnot, you can smooth it over and say, 
[02:13:30]  well, these are individual things on a large scale.  On a large scale where a tyrannical American government wants to completely take over in  some way.  I don't know what it would be.  But you cannot make that huge leap to, you know, mission accomplished.  You can't do that and then have people show up at Disney World the next day like nothing  happened.  You know what I mean?  It takes a... 
[02:14:00]  Shut up, Jimmy!  That's a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  It's a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  At the end of the day, what are you saying?  I still don't even understand what you're saying.  What I'm saying is an armed population of this country.  Okay.  Everyone that's armed in this country is...  Yes.  Yes, legally.  Okay.  You got arms.  I got arms.  Okay.  I got that.  Now what?  I believe it is a deterrent to the government just invoking its will on the people without... 
[02:14:30]  No, no, no.  Anthony, you really think...  Yeah.  Let's say...  Let's say you've got a tank.  Exactly.  Let's say you've got...  Armored vehicle personnel or whatever.  Yes, you have a nuclear warhead in your fucking garage.  Sure.  You really think at the end of the day, someone in Washington is going, listen, it's time for  takeover, but keep away from that Anthony from the O&A show. 
[02:15:00]  Because he's got too many weapons.  No, it never gets to that point.  So what is...  I understand what you just said.  It's a deterrent.  It's almost an uneven detente.  Like someone's got a dog and I don't want to go in that house because they've got a dog?  It's an uneven detente where it's a balance of power based on the fact that if anything  happens, it negates what we are right now.  It eliminates this country of ours.  If the United States military starts firing on American people who are firing back at 
[02:15:30]  the military on a level much bigger than Waco, then...  But that doesn't have to happen because...  You don't understand what I'm saying?  I don't know.  It's really pretty far-fetched.  It is not far-fetched.  You're talking about fucking communism.  You're talking about like pure Russian military.  Oh my God!  Hey look!  It's the 4th of July parade!  No, it's not!  Welcome to America! 
[02:16:00]  Oh my God!  They're shooting on us!  I thought it was a float!  What happened to America?  They took our guns away!  That's what happened?  It's goddamn Nazism all over!  Like, you're so far-fetched in what you're saying.  No, it's not far-fetched.  Yes, it is.  It's crazy.  It's lunacy what you're saying.  I'm not even saying what's lunacy.  It's lunacy.  You're saying more lunacy shit thinking the government is going to have some 18-year-old 
[02:16:30]  in a fucking shipping container launching drone attacks on cities that people have fucking...  That's lunacy!  That's more action movie shit than me saying that people, the knowledge that the American  people have over 300 million guns in their possession would stop.  You ever see the videos of like Iraq War when they're on the ships?  Yes!  What do you think?  That's a guy packing a fucking missile and that's a guy on a computer going...  I know that!  I think you're missing my point! 
[02:17:00]  I think a lot of people are.  No, I think a lot of people know exactly what I'm talking about.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It's simple.  There is a deterrent alone in the knowledge that the American people are armed.  Regardless if they're armed with fucking muskets or blowguns or anything else, there's a deterrent  there to know...  But no one cares if you've got a gun.  Like, I don't care if you've got a gun.  We're talking about crazy semi-automatic...  What's the difference between semi-automatic? 
[02:17:30]  Assault rifle.  Shut up with an assault rifle.  An assault rifle is a semi-automatic gun like a hunting rifle.  There's nothing different.  Right.  I'm talking like...  You can't own one.  You can't own a machine gun in this country.  You shouldn't!  There's no reason to!  But there is already a law!  There's no reason to...  I know, but again...  Why can't I have...  Why can't I go out right now in New York State and buy a semi-automatic AR-15 and take  it to the range?  Because if you get fucking wasted or someone finds it, it's just... 
[02:18:00]  It's a deadly fucking...  Ah, wasted.  Here's the other one.  Here's the other one.  Well, then you gotta stop cars and we should take cars away!  What a fucking retard argument!  It's all madness, dude.  It's the thought process that you really think it's gonna deter anything that I think  starts insulting intelligence.  Well, then I think the bigger insult is the thought process thinking taking guns away from 
[02:18:30]  people.  Not taking away.  Oh, yeah?  Try to buy that.  Try to buy that.  Why would I want to?  Because it's cold!  No, it's not!  Yes, it is!  One of my kids find it, and one of the retard kids across the street find it.  What are you, what are you, leaving it laying around like a rake?  I'm so jealous, man.  You gotta be what's called responsible when you're on a gun.  But people aren't!  Just like you want a car!  With a car!  You gotta be responsible with a car!  You do! 
[02:19:00]  But people aren't.  That's the problem.  But you have to be with a car!  But you're not.  You're letting people drive.  You're letting irresponsible people get into cars to drive and kill many more people  than guns.  Now, you laugh at that.  You laugh at it, but it's the same argument you're making!  Okay.  Oh, they leave their keys around for their 16-year-old to jump in and drive away!  Well, why do you leave your keys in your purse, dummy?  Because no one takes a car and purposely drives into a school and mows them the fuck down.  And you know what?  On a statistical level, it's very rare. 
[02:19:30]  Statistics.  All right, so when your kid is killed, you let me know how that statistic works.  All right, how about the fucking-  That's the dumbest thing ever.  How about the six kids in Chicago that were fucking shot over the weekend that no one  even gave a shit about?  Because we're that used to it now.  Like, oh, more kids killed.  Oh, is that it?  Is that it?  What are you arguing for?  What do you-  What?  What are you, like, barking for?  What do you want?  You just want machine guns?  I want the ability to live my fucking life the way I want it.  You have it!  No, I don't.  You got 50-  You got a big fucking contract.  I want to buy another one of those. 
[02:20:00]  You got a great-  I want to buy another one of those.  Then move to a country where you can get one.  I guess I can't.  Why not?  Because they figured out, the rest of the world figured out, that when the fucking people-  Oh my god!  Stop it!  The rest of the world figured out what?  That when you have-  Savages are killing people all over the world with weapons a lot less fucking sophisticated  than that.  And you know what?  The people that kill us here are nice, young, educated people.  They're not savages.  No, they're not.  They're wackos. 
[02:20:30]  Plenty on drugs.  Most of it is-  Or they had problems.  Or they grew up in a bad home.  They're not savages.  No, most of them are gang savages, and that's where all the homicides come from.  There's a small portion that are those crazy white kids that shoot up the schools, and that's  what the news picks up on.  But it's not romantic and fun enough when it's just gangbangers shooting grandma for  a piece of crack, or shooting at his buddy from three feet away and hitting three 12-year-olds.  Yeah.  Take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Fucking take it away.  They shouldn't have it. 
[02:21:00]  Take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Right.  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  The problem is, they legislate-  I'm annoyed that I can't light off M-80s anymore.  That bothers me.  But because some retard blew his fucking hand off or let his kid get wasted, he got wasted,  and the kid blew it up.  That fucked up 4th of July.  I think we still enjoy 4th of July every year.  Now I gotta travel to a fucking river to watch it for 20 hours, and then it'll take me nine 
[02:21:30]  hours to get home.  But we still have 4th of July.  It's no fucking difference.  No difference.  Too many retards, fucked it up.  The guy across the street, a guy in my general neighborhood, his kids came walking around  the neighborhood with bullets strapped around, and with one of his guns.  It's like-  He should have been arrested.  Should have been, but he wasn't.  He should have been fucking arrested.  He should have been, which proves to the point, we just, we can't take control of it. 
[02:22:00]  So when we can't take control of it, you're not allowed to play with the choice.  You're fucked.  You think that everyone should be based on the lowest common denominator and what they  can or can't fucking handle?  And that's how we should take it away?  Well, you know what?  Maybe sometimes you get up on stage, maybe you'll say shit that offends people or makes  people do things or influences people.  So why don't we just take what you say and throw that out the fucking window too, Brewer?  What's it got to do with taking a kind of shit somewhere? 
[02:22:30]  That makes no sense.  It, it, it, you're saying that because some people can't handle certain things, that everyone  can't have it.  No, murder weapons.  I don't have a murder weapon.  I don't have a weapon that can destroy and kill somebody.  Oh, we could argue that you're fucking, uh, influenced, you're very influential.  Your speech is very influential.  Okay.  And look out, you might influence people to hurt homosexuals or Negroes.  At the end of the day, are you upset just with guns in general or that you can't get  a machine gun? 
[02:23:00]  I like, no, no, I, I, I don't need a machine gun.  I, I, I, I like a, I like a good semi-automatic, you know, it, it, when you pull the trigger,  every one pull, one bullet flies out the other end.  And you use it for target and leisure.  I love going to the range and targets.  Yes.  And then I like having other weapons that I use for self-protection.  Yes.  Which is, uh, I kind of like the idea that it puts you on equal footing with some thug  that might want to do you bodily harm.  I, I'm with you there a hundred percent.  Someone busts in your door.  I'm with you.  I'm sure if someone kicks in your door, the first thing you're going to think is, I wish 
[02:23:30]  I had a gun.  Hey, I'm not going to lie to you.  Someone came over to my house.  He, he showed me his gun.  He's like, listen, I travel everywhere with a gun.  I need to let you know I have a gun in your house.  Oh, that's nice.  I said, okay, let me see.  He goes, listen, it's in a case, blah, blah, blah.  And he showed it to me and I'm not going to lie.  Um, my wife every night gives me a fucking, uh, false alarm.  Someone's breaking in.  And sometimes I get worried because I know the golf club or the bat just ain't going to 
[02:24:00]  do it with, with a bullet facing my torso.  That's true.  So this one night while they were sleeping over, I swear to God, slept like a baby.  No, I got woken up in the middle of the night.  Someone's hustling the front door.  What?  Some, I know I hear someone trying to get in the front door.  This is every other month.  It was the first time in my life. 
[02:24:30]  I just got up with no fear.  Walked to the front door and even asked who it was.  I just opened the front door knowing they may get me, but my kids are safe because right  next to them is some weapons are going to put major holes in these people or deter them.  Yeah.  I don't have a problem with, with that.  Right.  It's, it's sort of like playing a game with rules. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  We all have a rules to this game.  However, as much as steroids, baseball, whatever, obviously whoever's making the rules up aren't  sticking to them and it's, it's turning into bad shit here and there, even if this percentage  is small, even if it's blah, blah, blah.  And it's fucking things up for you who should have the right to go.  It certainly is.  I go to a range.  It's like this guy, he goes to a range.  When I went to the range, this guy had a, he had, it looked like a Smith and Wesson, 
[02:25:30]  but it was, it sounded like a cannon and he warned us.  He went, Hey, listen, he was a huge guy.  He went, Hey, listen, I'm shooting off a, I don't even, a salt rife.  He said it's a salt, but it was a pistol.  And this thing, literally, it was so loud.  Even with the, with the headphones on, it had a hole.  It was like, wow.  It was probably the 50 caliber, yeah.  Yeah.  And it went, wow. 
[02:26:00]  And flames came out the end.  Wow.  And the, and the, um, what do you call it?  The, the target would just explode like feathers getting a pigeon getting blown up.  And, and you can see his boner.  And I don't, I would have one too.  And my daughter, I had to say, she was shooting and she was a beast.  And she turned to me and she went, I really liked that feeling of power.  It's just, uh, it's fun to shoot. 
[02:26:30]  I get it.  But does the average citizen need that?  I mean, I don't know.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm just, then, correct.  Jimmy's an asshole.  Right.  So, but who was at the front door?  Who's at the front door?  Who was at the front door?  Her imagination.  I figured it was much, but I needed to know.  Her imagination.  Who was at the front door?  You left us with it and I opened the door.  Yeah.  I liked your, your analogy though with the sports and there has to be rules and things like that.  I understand the rule factor. 
[02:27:00]  But here's what happens.  Imagine playing a game where you're adhering to the rules.  Right.  But there's people on the other team that aren't paying attention to any rules.  And there's, they're not penalizing those people.  Every time someone doesn't pay attention to the rules, they go to the people that are  paying attention and give them more rules.  So now in New York State.  Like a household.  It's crazy.  If I'm in my house and my kids, I go, listen, no, no Fritos, no snacks after seven o'clock. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  Okay.  It's seven o'clock.  Any snacks, you're going to get punished.  You, you, you're screwed.  Right.  No, no iPads, no Instagram and no email, no nothing.  Okay.  Now, when I'm not around, I go upstairs and this little fucker sneaking.  I said, where'd you get that?  Well, mom said, mom said, hey, did we not agree?  Well, she did do her homework and blah, blah, blah.  And then two weeks later, there's ants infested in her bedroom and in my, and the cat has fleas 
[02:28:00]  because of the fucking bugs from the Fritos that she ate in a bed.  And I go, this is why I don't want Fritos in here.  And then it happened three times.  And then I go, you know what?  No more fucking Fritos, period.  Because I'm tired of people fucking with the rules.  Everyone's fucked.  So there, it's up to the people.  And I tell the sisters, I go, listen, I don't care which one of you fuckers do it.  One of you fuck up. 
[02:28:30]  You're all screwed.  That gives an incentive for the other ones to go, uh, don't bring Fritos up there.  I'm going to tell dad.  That might work.  I'm going to tell dad.  In the brewer dictatorship that you live in.  Yes.  Well, Fritos, someone's eating the Fritos in bed and no one's.  But I have a right to bear Fritos.  Yes, you do.  You cannot take that away from me.  Yes, you do.  And no one's going to come in and take them.  If you got the Fritos in your house, they're in your house. 
[02:29:00]  Tough shit.  They're in there already.  From here on now, it literally should be like, sit down.  What's your name?  Where are you from?  First of all, the way you look, you got to go home.  It's already out.  You're already out.  You're already out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[02:29:30]  It continues right now.  Right now.  Right now.  It is me, Iraq, and I'm hosting the worst of 2013 while Opie and Anthony and everybody  else is on vacation.  We hope you're enjoying everything you heard.  Maybe there's some stuff that you want to hear.  Is there a way to get in touch with us?  No.  We're on vacation.  But maybe you'll hear it in the upcoming days.  If not, then, you know, I don't know what to tell you.  We tried.  Where are we right now?  Jim Norton.  This is a couple of segments that involve Jim Norton.  The first one, Jim has been writing a lot lately.  He keeps talking about some TV show ideas that he has. 
[02:30:00]  This one here, he's pitching a reality show.  He breaks that down a little bit and gives us some details.  Then it goes into a song that Jim brings to the show.  It's new to the show, but it's a very, very old, obscure song that was on a record, like  a vinyl print in Mad Magazine.  How the fuck does anyone remember this?  But Jimmy does, and it gets stuck in everybody's head.  I'm pitching a prank show where we do, like, little wacky pranks. 
[02:30:30]  Like, um...  Any ideas?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's one I want to do where it's in the hospital, in the maternity ward.  Uh-oh.  And what we do is, we, like, we have, like, a fake fire where all the little bassinets  are.  Yeah.  And we come out and tell all the parents, we're sorry, but the fire's burned all of your  babies.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  And then...  Who are you pitching this to? 
[02:31:00]  Uh, NBC.  NBC, okay.  And then they cry and they scream.  Uh-huh.  And two weeks later, we get back in town.  Two weeks later?  You let them hang on the line for two weeks?  Yeah, on the way out.  And we interview people on the way out of the funerals and the legs.  Oh, my gosh.  And we keep the little tykes in a special room.  You take care of the little tykes, right?  Yes, we have people we hire that will breastfeed them.  Okay, good.  And do that initial bonding.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Initial bonding. 
[02:31:30]  And then the kid goes back to the family.  The initial bonding.  Yeah, but we're going to do it in a bunch of hospitals and then just show all the episodes.  Yeah.  It's called...  Yeah.  It's called Your Baby's Dead.  And the last D is tipped.  Almost like a half a smile.  Like, oh, no.  Wow.  I can picture the logo.  Your Baby's Dead.  It's just a prank show.  We have different... 
[02:32:00]  It's just an innocent prank show.  Yeah, but like one, there's a fire.  And then the other one, when all the parents are in the waiting room, we hire an actress  to play a nurse and she goes, oh!  And then the parents run to the window and there's a lion and we put fake blood in all  the bassinets and the lion has a little diaper in his mouth.  And the nurse is like, I don't know what happened.  I went to get a marmalade and when I came back, the babies had been eaten.  And what's the big reveal?  Is there like a big tagline? 
[02:32:30]  Like you've just been punked?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's...  Come on, lighten up.  Here's your kid.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  Yeah.  I'd watch that.  Yeah.  And then there's the one version, the holiday version, where what we do is we get someone  who has a miscarriage and then when they go like, oh, I'm so upset, we're like, ah, he's  fine.  And then you just...  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:00]  Jesus.  That's not good.  NBC, huh?  And then the big reveal.  Oh, is that all is not well.  Your baby's dead?  Yeah.  That's what it's called?  Yeah.  That's good.  I like that.  I think in the O for your, you have like a big tear coming out of like the face.  Or like an open mouth like, oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  A little shocked.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I think that'll be a great show.  Yeah.  NBC, huh?  Yeah.  I'm trying to get Yafit Kodo to host it. 
[02:33:30]  And I want to get big celebrities to play the nurses and the doctors.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And they come out and tell the people that they're, you know, babies.  Yeah, because this way, this way, like, the woman, we're like, your baby's dead.  She's like, oh, my God.  You look like Kathy Bates.  Who's on your short list?  Kathy Bates, who else?  Kathy Bates would be the nice one.  Taylor Swift.  Tina Fey, maybe?  She's, they love her at NBC.  Nah, Tina Fey.  No?  I don't want to use her.  No?  She's too popular.  Taylor Swift isn't?  Taylor Swift has an underground following. 
[02:34:00]  I don't think on TV they'll know who she is.  Just put a different, like, hairstyle on her?  Yeah.  And people think, like, what if they recognize them?  I'd be like, that'd be too Greek stricken.  Yeah, true.  They're not going to think.  They think their baby's dead.  They're not going to care.  You should get some of your celebrity friends like Ricky Gervais.  Yeah, your baby's dead.  That'd be great.  Sorry.  There's been a death up there.  Sorry.  Death in the nursery.  Yeah, get the fire version.  You got the fucking lion that ate all the kids. 
[02:34:30]  A lion.  How did a lion get into the little nursery area?  There's, um, we set it up where all the parents are coming in.  In the back, there's a fucking, like, a lion cage parked.  Parked?  Because they're having a circus in the parking lot.  Parked?  Yeah.  I didn't know you could park a lion cage.  Yeah, you park a lion cage there.  It's supposed to be, uh, it's a circus.  Oh, a circus is going on.  In the hospital parking lot?  Yes, to honor all the new babies. 
[02:35:00]  Oh.  And ironically.  The lion gets loose?  How does the lion get loose, though?  They don't, we don't say.  How does he get up the elevator?  Mm.  That's a good question.  That's a very good question.  Nobody will ask that in the time of grief.  No, they'll just be so grief-stricken.  He's a technical question.  He puts his five buttons and.  Yeah, he gets in.  That's right.  And a nurse's hat is missing.  And now, like, they see the lion.  He's wearing, like, a tattered nurse outfit.  Uh-huh.  So they know what happened.  He pretends.  Like Heath Ledger in Batman?  Yes.  That's all the babies. 
[02:35:30]  Pause.  And you could have, um, a ceiling collapse, perhaps?  Where they're all underneath a bunch of, uh, eye beams and rubble.  A lot of rubble.  Rubble.  Yeah.  That'd be a good one.  The father's handing out cigars.  When we come out, we go, you might want to put those away.  That gets some laughs.  Yeah.  Yeah, you might want to put those away.  That's right.  Your baby's got rubble on them.  If you're trying to see him, he'll have to say, no, we incinerated him.  Because we had to get the room cleaned up. 
[02:36:00]  They moved fast.  Yeah, we did.  We incinerated him.  We shuffled everything out and threw it in the incinerator.  Oh, my God.  It's a hell of a show.  Yeah.  This sounds like a big budget.  Is this primetime, NBC?  It has.  It is, yes.  To be rerun on Sunday morning.  After what show?  That's at 10 p.m.  10 p.m.?  Five nights a week.  Your baby's dead.  Five nights a week.  Can you imagine the outrage?  Oh, God. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, would that be bad?  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  All right.  Very funny.  I think it'd be a good show.  But again, the kids are fine.  Yeah.  Except for the one special episode.  What is that one?  Where the miscarriage just happened.  Oh, yeah.  He's good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you hand them over.  See how long.  And a hidden camera follows the parents.  Like, hey.  Hey.  An interesting little show.  I'm on board.  Yeah.  We're working on a book of lists, by the way. 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  If I record it.  It's going to be a coffee table book.  I'm working on a book of lisps.  Lisps.  Yes.  I have a book of lists.  You do?  I do.  A bunch of lists.  Yeah?  Yeah.  John List.  Yes.  Yes.  I actually did.  It was one of the first things I wrote.  It was a list of lists.  Yes.  Oh, that's right.  Like the 50 funniest moments in child pornography.  Oh, yes.  Women with the worst smelling pussies in order of ethnicity. 
[02:37:30]  I would so buy that book.  Yeah, I really should.  There's no real list.  The joke is in the list title.  It's just the list title.  You should just throw it out there as a little thing.  The list of lists.  The list of lists.  You guys are big fans of proposals?  No.  A what?  Oh, like...  There was an article in the paper today that you can't just ask someone to marry you anymore.  It has to be an over-the-top production.  And, like, women are starting to expect that.  Fuck them.  They're starting to expect more than the, hey, will you marry me shit. 
[02:38:00]  Enough of that.  I have the best way.  Really?  Oh, Jimmy.  And how is this?  It's a new show.  Oh, no.  Yeah?  Um, and it's called, uh, Will You Marry Me?  Okay.  And it's funny places where they, uh, we fake...  Like, there's one where a girl is jogging.  Uh-huh.  And we have, um, nine Negro actors, uh, grab her. 
[02:38:30]  Right.  And drag her into an alley.  Yeah.  And they have a rubber knife.  Mm-hmm.  And they take her clothes off, and they are pretending they're about to rape her.  Yeah.  And then as she's going, ah, that her boyfriend, uh, the, the, the black guy opens up a hand  and there's a ring in it, and he goes, yo, what is this?  Oh, well.  And she goes, it's a ring.  And then her boyfriend pops out from behind and says, will you marry me, Helen?  Helen.  Helen.  That's a good, that's a good one. 
[02:39:00]  It's a crazy wedding thing.  I remember MASH, I mean, uh, Mad Magazine did the parody, and they called it Hammy Days.  They were terrible with their titles.  They were funny, though, Mad Men.  They were a really brilliant parody.  Like, a crockwork lemon.  Yeah.  A crock of shit now for Apocalypse Now where they bleeped out shit.  It was very funny.  A crock of shit now.  Oh, I remember a little record album in the back of a Mad Magazine.  Yes.  An Archie Bunker one.  Yeah.  It was square.  You peeled it off the page and put it on your record player. 
[02:39:30]  A record player.  Yeah.  Not even a turntable.  It wasn't a nice turntable.  It was a record player.  There was another song on the back.  It was a big song from Mad Magazine on the back of the, uh, God, can you look up Mad Magazine  songs from, like, there was a...  Oh, fuck.  Remember the mad, uh, the folding thing at the end?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was folding so it wouldn't bend my magazine.  Make it out.  Make it out.  Everyone's making out.  Is this it?  But me. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, look.  We get to hear it.  Maybe.  Oh, disco years, huh?  Yeah, I...  I wanna break out, lose, and swing.  You liked this?  I don't...  I'm sure I did, yeah.  Yeah.  Till those bells ring ding-a-ling.  Loud as can be.  Sounds laughing at you now.  Ding-a-ling.  Could I never hear them chime?  Cause I chicken out each time.  Uh-huh. 
[02:40:30]  And I know the only ding-a-ling is me.  It is me, yeah.  Oh, you like it.  It's horrible.  Now...  Make it out.  I tell myself I could be should be.  Make it out.  This is terrible.  Is this funny?  Is that it?  Everyone's making out but me.  Yeah.  I loved this when I was younger.  Oh, because you weren't making out. 
[02:41:00]  No, I wasn't.  Well, you made out with the girl in the tent,  but she told her brother  to not go away.  Yeah.  Cause some drunk is...  Oh, what's this?  This is horrible.  This is so bad.  It's funny.  No, it's not funny at all.  Would you rather watch Topo Jijo, Sam?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Topo Jijo is pretty bad.  Topo Jijo is rough.  Horrible.  I loved it as a kid.  You did?  Yeah, because it was just a fucking puppet.  You didn't realize they were making fun of you? 
[02:41:30]  Why were they making fun of me?  Oh, the Italian thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Making out.  Making out.  Making out.  That's horrible.  This is...  It's not funny.  I'm making out.  Is it...  Oh...  Oh, all I'm making out.  Oh, all I'm making out,  like all I'm figuring  from all that's making out  is everyone's making out but me.  It's very Chippersyn.  Fucking hilarious.  How long is this fucking thing? 
[02:42:00]  Six and a half minutes.  Six and a half minutes.  I hear that there are Oakman Raiders.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Ralph Nader's got his hot.  He's saying he's making out.  Ralph Nader.  In Star Wars, you just know  Darth Vader's making out.  Oh.  This is terrible.  Oh, pop culture.  They're topical.  He's not eating fat.  Make it out.  Yeah.  The Wolfman, any place he's at,  is making out.  I've even seen a Muppet  that is making out.  Oh, this is so bad.  I'm getting deuce chills. 
[02:42:30]  There's still four minutes left.  This is time.  Plenty of time for laughter.  Yuck-o.  I never...  What's the date on this Mad Magazine?  How much respect would you lose  to me if it was 1997?  How long?  We have to hear the whole thing.  I said I'd like some Close Encounters.  Dude.  Oh, Close Encounters.  All right, so it's after 77.  After 70...  You'll never get it on.  There's no time period 
[02:43:00]  where this would be appropriate.  78.  78.  I thought this was a hoot and a half.  I have to show him how.  I thought it was a good chorus.  Almost a rocky horror sound to it.  I thought it was cool.  Make it out.  I tell myself I could be, should be.  Make it out.  Who did this?  You gonna come after this  in your next special?  It sounds like America Sings.  Oh, let's make it out.  Come on.  No, I won't come on.  Everyone's making out.  Got it.  You're not making out with anyone. 
[02:43:30]  But me.  How did they think  they could make this an epic?  Making out.  Making out.  What did they have?  Like six minutes?  Six and a half minutes?  Of vinyl?  Oh.  Oh.  And Superman.  Well, that is king.  Just making out.  Superman.  King Kong when he is going ape.  Ape is making out.  His references.  No.  Freaking star.  No, student shock is making out.  I've even heard that Mr.  Spock is making out.  Oh. 
[02:44:00]  Would you believe that my rock is making out?  You know how many times he listened to this?  He had to have listened to it a lot.  He had to entertain all this information 30 years later.  Everyone's making out.  All right with the making out.  Making out's funny.  How often did you listen to this?  Constantly.  Jimmy, this is awful.  Your parents would have to put up with you listening to this in the house.  Because this girl I used to see wasn't very hot for me.  How old were you when you were listening to this?  Ten.  Eleven. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  This is a super special issue.  And the cover has all the people that are making out.  Yeah.  Is that Fonzie in the upper right?  I don't mess around with any Capricorn.  Is this Fonzie?  Yeah.  More.  Making out.  Making out.  It's still another two minutes.  This is so bad.  I'm making out.  I got it.  Imagine being a parent and hearing this coming from your kid's room. 
[02:45:00]  Hilarious.  After they got their mad magazine.  How embarrassing.  I used to love this song.  Apparently.  All right.  Can you imagine getting through the six and a half minutes and the sound of your kid  picking up the needle and moving it right back to the beginning.  Right back to the beginning.  Starting it over.  Hey, did you?  See, you're making some funny lines.  Jacques Cousteau?  Would you have listened to this more than one time in a row? 
[02:45:30]  The Fonz we know most every night is making out.  And Charlie Brown, though he's a type, he's making out.  You like that part, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Oh, God.  Making out.  Did you go to school and say, hey, did you hear making out?  I heard making out.  Yeah.  Oh.  Making out.  But all.  I'm making out.  It's all. 
[02:46:00]  It's making out.  It's so bad.  It's that everyone's making out.  I can't believe it's still going.  But.  Oh, I forgot.  It's the big ending.  You, uh.  I don't remember who I was at the beginning of this song.  Yeah.  A douche.  Right.  Okay.  Do you want to hear it again?  No.  Sure.  No.  That's it.  Making out.  I just want you to know that you will be thinking of that for the rest of the day.  I don't want to, though.  I don't know what part you'll be thinking of. 
[02:46:30]  I don't want to.  Some of you will be thinking, I tell myself I could be, should be, making out.  Or.  I'll just be doing.  Making out.  This making out.  Mine will be making out.  Making out.  Oh.  Is that everyone's making out?  But me.  But me.  That's, uh.  Yeah, I don't remember that, Jimmy.  I fucking love it.  I played that a lot.  There you go.  Don't.  $5.99. 
[02:47:00]  Buy it now.  Wait.  You can buy the magazine with making out.  You know what?  Everything you think is collectible ain't.  It's not.  Uh.  Well.  You played the record.  Uh.  There's a little wear on the pages.  I'll give you a 50 cents for it.  The song is dog shit.  The song sucks.  Well, Chumley liked singing Make It Out.  Count Dracula with just one bite is making out.  Stop it.  I hate the making out song. 
[02:47:30]  It's so bad.  That's because everyone was making out but you.  That's how I thought.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  Hey, it's E-Rock and we've gotten to the moment you've all been waiting for.  At least on today's show.  As Sam dubs it, the first annual Opie and Anthony gay off. 
[02:48:00]  You heard me correct.  We had some money to give away.  Different variations for different prizes.  And we asked gentlemen to come in here and see how gay would they go to win this money.  And we do find out with the next few segments being completely dedicated to the gay off.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[02:48:30]  Wait, we've got to play the official opener to the one and done gay off.  Okay, the official opener.  Let's play the opener.  Here we go.  Once in a blue moon.  Yeah, fuck.  Look at that.  Does one get to witness the birth of a rich tradition?  Oh, that feels good.  Yeah.  Today, we witness such a birth.  Brace yourself.  And clench your cheeks.  Oh, that feels good.  As the Opie and Anthony show proudly presents.  The first annual gay off. 
[02:49:00]  Yes, sir.  The supposed heterosexuals have arrived.  And so have I.  One at a time.  These studs will be all gayed up on in front of their real life wives.  All for the sake of a couple bucks.  The gayosity won't stop until our contestant taps out.  Or his wife does it for him.  I've already come out.  So we better get the party started.  Wow. 
[02:49:30]  Very good.  Sam, leading the applause.  Well done.  Well done.  All right, Sal.  It's to you.  All right.  Who's our first contestant?  I forgot their names.  We should have put name tags on them or something.  Or we could write their names in lipstick.  Why are the contestants today have to have their shirts on?  I mean, how are we supposed to get some tickling done?  Dice, I apologize.  I'm trying to do the bit right.  I have to do the bit right.  Do the bit right. 
[02:50:00]  You got to do it right.  Jimmy is a team player.  You know that.  I commit.  You do know he's a company man.  Okay.  What does the show need, Jimmy?  What does the show need?  What this show needs?  I think this show, the problem is we've gotten off track a little bit.  Yeah.  And I think perhaps a little bare-chested men would just set the course straight.  All right.  I think the guys should take their shirts off.  Dice, you still in?  Or are you ready to leave?  It's like a gym.  It's like a gym.  All right.  Like he said.  He loves me.  It's like a gym.  All right. 
[02:50:30]  Fair enough.  He's in the gym every day.  That's right.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's closed.  There's no air conditioning in here.  Right.  It's getting fucking hot in here.  Why are you going to put on gloves?  I'll say.  How are you going to take on someone with gloves?  You don't have to take on people with gloves on.  You can put the gloves on when you have to grab their ball back.  How are you going to wear gloves?  What are you going to do with gloves?  What are you going to do with gloves?  What are you going to do with gloves?  What are you going to do with gloves?  That's like saying you're dirty.  Exactly.  What are you going to do with gloves?  I don't want to do this at all.  That's right.  Huh?  He knows when it comes.  He's smart with this.  All right.  So which guy are we starting with? 
[02:51:00]  I don't know their names.  I know that's Dave.  I know that's John.  Who else we got?  Dennis is in the middle.  Oh, we start with Dennis.  John.  Let's start with Dennis.  And Adam's at the end.  Dennis.  Dennis.  There he goes.  So how long does he have to tickle him for?  45 minutes.  45 minutes.  45 minutes.  Yes.  That'd be awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How long does he have to tickle him for?  That's up to you guys.  What?  Like 30 seconds?  What do you think, Dice?  You're good at this.  I mean, if you're not going to tap out.  You know what?  You're pretty good at the tickling.  45 would really be nerve wracking. 
[02:51:30]  Nerve wracking.  Yes.  You know, for him.  Are we going for nerve wracking?  I don't know.  It's got to get a little comfortably long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  45.  37 seconds.  37 seconds.  Let's go 37 and a half seconds.  All right.  37 and a half seconds.  Yeah.  Kenny's got it.  Please.  All right.  This is so good.  Kenny's got it.  It's so good.  Go to the...  We can all see.  Oh, boy.  Give him a little tickling.  But you've got to do fingertip tickling.  But wait a minute. 
[02:52:00]  The guy that's getting tickled.  Yeah.  If it doesn't feel like tickling, don't laugh.  You know, don't fake it.  Yeah.  And don't make yourself cum just to make the bed better.  Okay.  No, don't point my way.  What?  All right.  Give him a little...  Ready?  All right.  Here we go.  But he's got his pants on.  How's Sal supposed to tickle his thighs?  Well, they've got to tickle him later.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Where's the tickling going?  Underarms?  Where are we going?  The whole body?  Upper body, right?  Just upper body, underarm.  Like you would anybody.  Across the chest and nipples and then the sides.  Jesus. 
[02:52:30]  Take him to the nipples, Sal.  Oh, Sal.  He's slightly brushing.  Do what you've got to do.  Who's timing it for the 37?  I got it.  Sam's got it.  Sam's got the timer?  The man over here says, like, when?  Yes.  Yeah.  And start.  Okay, lift your arms up.  Oh!  Go ahead.  It's jodering.  No, it's jodering.  Go ahead.  Whatever.  Tickle, tickle.  Tickle, tickle.  Hold on.  Stop the clock. 
[02:53:00]  Stop the clock.  Tickle, tickle.  Stop the clock.  There he is.  He's dry heaving.  Stop the clock.  Sal, tickle, tickle.  I stopped.  Why are you getting sick?  How many seconds?  Why are you getting sick?  Sal, are you okay?  This is gay.  This is disgusting.  You should like this.  He's getting physically sick.  Get in there.  How are you getting sick?  He's getting physically ill.  I'm sorry, Dice.  I didn't mean to.  Wait.  Okay.  Are we losing Dice?  I'm going on for a minute.  I'm not quitting.  We're losing you. 
[02:53:30]  I just don't want him throwing up on me.  We're losing you.  No.  Did you see what just really happened?  Get over there.  Sal, tickle him.  It's the tickling.  This is easy.  Get over there.  My new friend here.  Dice.  Dice.  Come on, Dice.  You can do this.  I've got to stay in somewhere else.  You know what?  You can do this because you've got the big shows in Vegas.  This is training.  You're training.  Do guys throw up when they get prison raped, do you think?  Why are you puking, Sal?  Because this is...  Under the arm.  Tickle, tickle, Sal.  Not when I want to do so much.  Oh, Sal.  Let's go. 
[02:54:00]  Get in there.  All right, ready?  Coochie cooch, Sal.  Tickle him.  Go.  Tickle, tickle.  Come on.  Get out of here.  I don't want to like this fucking game.  Tickle him.  How's he supposed to get in there?  One man tickling another.  Go ahead.  Tickle him.  Come on.  Get in there.  Come on.  Go to the sides.  Tickle his little sides. 
[02:54:30]  His little sides, Jimmy.  Tickle his sides already, for Pete's sake.  Shut your eyes.  Yeah, shut your eyes.  Open your mind.  That's it.  Oh, look.  He's just laughing.  Get up there.  Now, tickle him.  Come on, Sal.  Sal.  There's nothing funnier than the joking.  There's nothing funnier than the fucking joking.  I didn't know it was going to be that fucking funny.  I told you.  We make shit funny.  I love that you add that. 
[02:55:00]  Tickle his belly button.  I'm not adding that.  That's what's coming out of me.  Tickle him.  How many seconds does he have left on the first contestant?  20.  You still got 20 seconds.  20 seconds.  Let's go.  Come on.  And tickle, tickle, Sal.  Think about carpet.  You can move around his body.  Yeah, get the whole beautiful body in there, too.  Put your finger on his belly button.  Tickle his belly button.  Oh, come on.  You got to take that on the road.  Troy, what's going on?  You got to take this on the road.  Sal's not stepping up to the plate.  Sal, what the fuck, Sal? 
[02:55:30]  We put bronzer on you and everything.  That's the greatest routine I've ever seen.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  People would go out of their fucking minds if you went on the road with this.  Throwing up, choking, just being the tickling man.  Where the fuck is this guy?  Sal, the tickler.  What are you doing?  We got three more guys.  Come on, come on.  Get to the business.  How many?  13.  13 seconds to go.  Keep going.  Oh, look.  He's laughing.  He laughed.  Is that enough?  He's having fun.  Tickle, tickle.  37 seconds.  That's nice.  That's nice. 
[02:56:00]  Get underarms.  Tickle was under.  Hoochie, coochie.  He got it.  He got it.  All right, Sal.  One down, three to go.  Only three more men to tickle.  That was what life was about.  That's why I was going to see that.  Oh, boy.  That was the greatest thing ever.  Three more men.  He might be at Governor's with you this weekend as your opening act.  Right, Dice?  Why?  He might be at Governor's for your opening act now.  You know what?  I haven't worked that hard in years. 
[02:56:30]  That is fucking fantastic.  You wrote that?  No.  You wrote that?  Yeah, if that's the opening of your show, I can't wait to see what he closes with.  Go ahead.  You got to close yourself.  I didn't even fucking sleep.  Nah.  This is the greatest thing I've seen.  I haven't seen anything in movies or TV that fucking great in the longest fucking time.  All right, let's go on to the second contestant.  Do the choking with it again. 
[02:57:00]  Dude, throw some of that in, and the gag is hysterical.  Yeah, go ahead, Sal.  Tickle him lightly.  Wait, let me just catch my breath.  Wait, Sal.  Let me catch him.  All right.  Do the belly button, too, Sal.  The belly button is very thick.  That's hilarious.  Lightly, lightly.  You'll hurt him.  Look at him with the direction.  Go.  Yeah, tickle the belly button.  There you go.  Now do the nipples.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  You're not loving this.  Yes. 
[02:57:30]  Get in there.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Tickle, tickle, under those arms.  Oh, my God.  Take a second.  Get in there.  I got a deal.  Bad boy.  Get in there.  Fucking deal.  Go.  One more time.  Under the arms.  Go.  Come on.  Coochie-coe under the arms.  We're all having some laughs.  You don't even have to see it.  It's that fucking funny.  You just got to hear him choking to death like that.  Choking to death.  Shit.  What would be funnier than that?  He's not laughing. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  I'm not ticklish.  Oh, you're not ticklish.  I'm not ticklish.  I don't see.  That's a problem.  I get the best phone.  Come on.  Tickle, tickle.  Tickle, tickle.  Smell your fingers.  You can't be tickled.  Smell your fingers.  Uh-uh.  Go ahead.  Smell them.  Is the underarms wet?  Smell your fingers.  Your voice is telling you to smell your fingers.  Smell your fingers.  We made a decision.  Yeah, yeah.  Try his underarms.  It's still pretty nasty.  Give him a tickle.  A little man-on-man time. 
[02:58:30]  Manly.  You don't pinch him.  For some reason.  Lightly.  You have no chemistry.  How much more time?  Let's go another seven seconds.  He's not ticklish.  That's good.  There's no chemistry with you and him.  I could feel it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No chemistry.  The other guy, you were choking on it, gagging on it.  All right, who's next?  John?  I'm being told that Go-Go is five minutes away, so we have plenty of time.  Go-Go!  Who needs that fucking guy now?  You gotta stop.  Wait till you meet Go-Go.  Yeah, Go-Go is, I believe, a pure delight.  I can't wait to meet Go-Go. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, boy.  All right.  All right.  Look at that.  In a perfect tickle position for yourself.  Maybe you should stand different.  What do you mean?  What are we doing wrong?  Yeah, maybe you could reach around from the back.  That's a good idea.  I mean, just to change it up.  Yeah.  No, I think it's a good position to start, at least.  Disgusting.  No, no, but if you can't think to him a little.  Let's go, Sal.  Just try tickling around the belly.  I just love that he didn't turn the guy.  He went behind the guy.  Wrap all the way around.  Tickle the belly.  He says, Cliss.  Yeah, get close. 
[02:59:30]  Go ahead.  No, go around.  Touching.  Touching.  Go around that stomach.  Get that belly, Sal.  Tickle.  He's tickling.  Glitch around.  Aren't you cool?  Caress his breasts.  Oh, my God.  Go ahead.  You got a joke like you did with the first guy.  And the nipples, too.  And the nipples.  See, the minute you tell a guy he's got a great act, he stops trying.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, there's no choking.  You don't like the armpits, do you?  That's his Achilles heel.  That's a bullshit cough. 
[03:00:00]  I agree.  That wasn't a real one.  The other ones that he was doing was real.  Go to the front, Sal.  Go to the front.  Tickle this baby boy.  Give him a good...  Give this big bear a tickle.  How many seconds has he got on this?  He's still got another 20 to go.  Yeah, but isn't it about not connecting...  Come on.  We're all having fun.  Yay.  Tickle tickle.  I stayed up all fucking night for this.  Get in there.  That's what this show needs.  Oh, fucking night to watch some guy clamming.  I know, right?  I don't even know how to tickle a guy. 
[03:00:30]  You're doing a terrific job.  You're doing all right there.  The show has gotten way off track, and this is what we need to set the course.  All right, he's done.  Next contestant.  This is the first round of the one and done gay off.  All right.  The young trucker.  Oh, yes.  Oh, you are sweaty.  Oh, he's sweaty.  You are sweaty.  You think this is a problem?  It's nice.  He's trying to turn it on.  Come on.  Get under there.  His fucking pits rule.  Wow, they are really sweaty.  Oh, wow.  This guy is great.  Make him laugh, baby.  Yeah.  Come on.  Get under there. 
[03:01:00]  He looks like white guy dreadlocks his armpits.  Okay.  Tickle up.  Get up into those armpits.  Oh, God.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  He's ticklish.  Keep going.  There you go.  Oh, it's lovely.  Oh, he's just touching his nipples.  This is...  Yeah, it's fucking...  It's not gay enough.  This is so bad.  Not gay enough.  Like, there were chicks doing a joke for him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, we're done.  We're done with Raul.  Wait, you don't think it's good?  Yeah, they were...  Just sickened. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They're just fucking sickened.  Are they sickened?  There's actual chicks watching you do it.  I don't know that they do that.  Yeah, it's fine.  He's doing a good job.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  You wave, Dice.  Go, yeah.  See, they're right there.  What's the next one, Ope?  What's the next one?  We got to move this along here.  Well, we got the lap dance.  Oh.  No, I'm not.  GoGo's here.  I'm done.  How long do I wait?  Is he here?  No, he's not here yet.  No, he's not here, sir.  Get the chair in for the lap dance.  Wait, bring a chair in,  or should we use one that's already here? 
[03:02:00]  Can the chair be too high?  Do we have a low chair?  Yeah, we got the lazy boy back there.  I fucking sit on that every morning.  Wow, that's even better.  Fuck.  Dice, you might have to move your jacket again.  No, Kenny's got it out there.  Oh, okay.  Hey, boy, Sam, pull that lazy boy out.  All right.  Let's get the fun started.  So what are we up to now?  Oh, cool.  When is the other gay guy?  GoGo should be here any minute.  All right.  Really.  All right, until then, we got to continue, Sal.  I don't know what to tell you. 
[03:02:30]  Sal, comment?  Sal's terrific.  I'm good.  I'm done.  You do a good job.  Why are you using clock swipes on yourself?  I'm going to, yeah, I would love to take a shower right now, but...  Yeah, I don't know.  Why are you so sweaty?  Why is he so sweaty?  I don't know.  That's in very close proximity to some fucking...  Oh, he doesn't get anything.  He gets to continue to work here.  No.  I don't know what the gist of this contest is supposed to be.  What happens?  The guys, like, if they back out, the last guy in wins?  Yeah.  What if they all just don't back out? 
[03:03:00]  Well, we're all lucky.  It's just a long, good show.  We get to know people.  The show's set on course.  Sam has a contingency plan.  Oh, you know, and the women don't look thrilled at all.  Well, they couldn't be too happy.  You're not too happy, huh, ladies?  How does it feel to have somebody so disgusted by touching your husband?  Anyone?  I don't know anything like that.  Like, what they...  He wasn't that disgusted to touch my husband, so...  Oh.  He seemed kind of into it.  You hardly gagged at all.  That's true.  Your husband was probably the least sweaty, though.  Or no, was he?  I don't fucking know.  Okay, Sal doesn't fucking know. 
[03:03:30]  All right, Sal, it's time for the lap dance.  Yeah, I think so, too.  So who's the first in the chair?  I don't think Sal wants to do the lap dance.  Who wants to go first?  Oh, yeah, that one's...  You!  Who's he?  It's amazing.  I don't know.  What's your name again?  Adam, right?  Adam.  Hi, Adam.  Welcome aboard.  Oh, what is this now?  Oh, he's sitting in the chair.  Yeah, well...  He's leaning back.  He's got his legs spread.  Yeah.  Shirt off.  Yeah.  Does it...  So what does Sal have to do?  Gyrate?  Get some money out.  For how long?  How long for the lap dance, Dice?  You're good with the time thing.  At least 45 to a minute.  45 to a minute? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  They can like a strip club or something.  Let's go a minute.  How long did they do it?  Let's go a minute.  A minute's long.  That's long.  Yeah.  Can you do a minute?  You know what?  Half a minute would work.  Are we going to get some dirty or some gay music?  Well, Sal's saying he's done.  I don't know what the fuck that means.  That's not true.  What do you mean, Sal?  What does that mean?  You're done?  He'll be your enemy.  You're tendering your resignation?  What?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, the only way out of this is to quit.  To show up.  He's done.  Not to bit. 
[03:04:30]  Right, right.  If he could dance, he could explode.  Exactly.  What are we going to do?  He's going to have to shake his ass in his face.  I think he's got to do a lap dance.  We could do like that, maybe go around the chair a few times.  Yeah, just fucking work it a little bit.  Let's get some music.  Straddle him.  Straddle him a little.  Yeah, what are we doing?  Let's get some music.  Yeah, good at it, Sal.  All right, Sal.  We got some music playing.  Wow, man.  This is good game music.  At least dance around the chair.  Yeah.  Can they get the music in here?  I mean, let's get the vibe going.  Fez isn't going to like that.  Yeah, we got some headphones. 
[03:05:00]  You don't like when we discuss gay issues.  Well, we don't like when he doesn't talk for eight fucking weeks in a row.  Holy shit.  What's going on here now?  I love the Fez.  Let's go, Sal.  You can't do it.  Sal doesn't want to do it.  Sal has just quit the show.  Holy fuck.  Just dance around the chair.  He just quit the show, does it?  Dance around the chair.  Yeah, just dance around the chair.  Would you see what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, Sal.  My dick hasn't been budged since I got here.  Come on, come on. 
[03:05:30]  Do a dance.  I'm good after the whole thing.  Hold it up the show, dude.  You really don't.  Troy, sorry.  You want to show them how it's done, Troy?  You want to lap dance here, these guys?  Yeah, one guy.  Just the one guy just to show Sal.  Because you are down for whatever.  I'm not saying that.  Yeah, but you're fully dressed.  I don't have to take off all my clothes.  Well, take off your clothes, I guess.  Yeah, maybe some of them.  All right, one guy?  Yeah, one guy.  Just to show Sal how much of a pussy he is.  And this is Troy. 
[03:06:00]  He's just down for whatever.  Right on, right, Sam.  He's down for whatever.  Good cheers.  Hip, hip, hooray.  Guys, this isn't gay because he's down for whatever.  He's down for whatever.  It's a whole different thing.  Yeah.  For whatever.  Producing the party on the show, he's busy.  I get it.  I don't do it.  All right.  There we go.  Hey, look.  There's the party.  Yeah, there was the party from last night, Obama.  Wonderful.  All right, here's Troy.  Troy's now on.  Troy's now on.  Troy's down for whatever.  But this is because he's down for whatever, Jimmy.  You know that.  You can hear the music. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, it's good.  Where's your new tat, by the way?  I saw you Instagramming it.  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a pretty cool tat.  All right.  Music's on?  You want some headphones?  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go, Troy.  Troy?  See, Sal?  What the fuck?  What's the big deal?  Troy's the best.  Bring right-side Fred back.  Wait.  Troy's requested right-side Fred.  Yeah.  There we go.  All right.  He's better than Troy.  Troy is straddling the guy's face. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, Troy's got tain in the guy's face.  Troy has his penis over the guy's face in his underpants.  Oh, no, no.  Troy is now balancing.  Oh, he's dancing to the guy's face.  Oh, the girls are applauding now.  The girls are applauding. 
[03:07:30]  The girls are applauding.  This is a...  Troy's swinging his microphone.  He's doing a Roger Daltrey.  He is just making Sal look like a pussy.  Yeah.  That's how you do it, Sal.  Woo!  Sal, now get in there.  Get in there, Sal.  Take the headphones in there.  And feel the music.  Woo!  Yeah.  Fuckin' Troy.  That's it.  Troy earned a buck.  Troy earned a buck.  You got a dollar for that.  All right, Sal.  Did you learn something? 
[03:08:00]  I'll do one.  All right, I'll do one.  Get those headphones on.  All right, wait.  Who did you not enjoy the most?  We'll even give you that choice.  Who did you enjoy the least?  No, you can pick your guy.  Sal, pick your guy.  Pick your type.  Yeah, I'm going to go with my man with this guy.  Dennis.  Oh, really?  Is that your type?  He's got a favorite.  Do you have a song you like?  I don't know.  Something.  He's got a favorite.  Okay, Eric's got a song.  Eric's got a song?  Yeah.  All right, Sal now understands what's going on here.  All right.  Killed it.  Careless. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Now you saw Troy how to teach you.  And you got to grind on him, Sal.  Troy, you can work him through it, too.  You know, tell him what moves and stuff and what, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Coach him through this shit.  So far, the gay love.  No one's backing out yet.  I know.  We haven't moved so long.  It's already 930.  930.  We got nothing happening here.  This is crazy.  Let's go.  This isn't done.  What is this?  Come on.  What are you doing?  This isn't gay fucking music.  What are you doing?  Eric, you stink.  You're dumb.  Sorry, I didn't know gay strip music. 
[03:09:00]  He puts on motorcycle sounds.  What is he doing?  What a fucking boob.  They have the exact same thing.  There you go.  A classic, guys.  The village people.  You know, it's great, Sal.  I can't feel it.  Oh.  What in there, Sal?  What in there, Sal?  I think hasn't moved.  He's climbing his ass in the guy's face.  For a guy that doesn't want to do this, he's really into it.  He's pumping into the guy's face. 
[03:09:30]  I can't.  Sorry, Sal.  I'm sorry.  You picked the wrong day to come in.  He's jumping on the guy's cock.  He's being a macho man.  Get out there.  Grind on his leg.  What are you doing?  Good job, Sal.  Don't fuck.  His bag's all falling out.  Sit on him.  Sal's fucking balls are falling out.  He's rubbing his ass in the guy's face.  His fucking bag was falling out.  Not bad, right, Troy?  All right, I mean, no style? 
[03:10:00]  Troy's not impressed.  All right, at least he did it.  All right, Sal at least did it.  Nah, he didn't have a...  Dice, get a microphone.  No one could hear you.  What?  The gagging and the choking.  That's where the funny comes in.  I know.  We need more funny?  That was the gay.  You tickle a guy.  You're choking to death, but you got your balls in his face.  Yeah, because I don't know.  It's just not the same thing.  I have to go out of my way to touch him.  There, I was just putting my dick in his general head area.  So that you enjoyed more.  I didn't enjoy any of this today.  It's fine. 
[03:10:30]  It's easy.  You're going to enjoy it.  We got two more guys.  Two more?  You know how to say it?  I lost.  Yeah, I lost.  Two more for Sal.  Well, is the guy here?  Not yet.  Oh my God, we're getting fucking stood up.  This is such bullshit.  You think we're getting stood up by a guy?  What's next up?  What's going to happen next?  Well, he's not almost here.  I heard 20 minutes ago, 45 minutes ago.  What's next, though, on the list?  We're still doing this part.  When did the chicks come into it?  We're still going to do two more lap dances, right guys? 
[03:11:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  Didn't they get through that?  No, two more.  They all have to do the same thing.  So I guess Sal has to continue.  Yeah.  I honestly can't see these guys not just doing everything.  That's what I said.  Well, I think that they...  Moneyball.  That's exactly what I said.  I don't know.  Did you see number eight?  Come back.  Dice, what the fuck?  He'll come back.  All right.  All right.  Come back.  Oh, boy.  Don't leave.  Come back. 
[03:11:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on here.  We need a lap dance.  We don't know what's going on.  We need a lap dance.  There you go.  Sit down.  I'm surrounded.  Dice is at Governor's this weekend.  What's the matter, Travis?  At Governor's this weekend.  If you don't come back.  In between balls in the face and tickling armpits.  Yeah.  She keeps saying any minute, any minute.  She absolutely said, you know, that he'll be here.  All right.  You know what?  We should...  Because no one's going to tap out over just one dance.  All right.  You got it, buddy.  You got this.  Me and you.  We got to double the game. 
[03:12:00]  Two-person dance.  Two-person dance.  I'm sorry, Dice.  All right.  Dice is leaving.  Dice is...  You got this.  You said you were the one that was going to step up.  You wanted to be bronzed.  Who does, Dice?  I didn't want to do any of this.  I said I should be leaving.  I have to show you how it's done.  Now get out there and finish the dances.  But double the dick makes it double gayer.  Double the dick.  Double the price.  Wait.  It's pretty obvious that they're not going to tap out with the lap dance.  So we could move on to some lap dancing slash dry humping.  And there's over the pants fondling, too.  Ooh. 
[03:12:30]  Ooh.  One of the other things we could do is the entertainer...  Jesus, Jimmy.  The entertainer is supposed to remove their clothes and then swap underwear with them.  Right.  I'm just saying.  That's something we haven't done yet.  Sal, you would do that.  No.  Because you're not actually touching them.  Yeah, but that's...  I don't know what the fuck these guys got.  What part of swapping underwear would be they would take off each other's underwear?  Right.  Of course.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not afraid to get naked in the studio, apparently.  But it's just...  I don't want to put their fucking underwear on. 
[03:13:00]  It'll be fine.  How about if you just smell it?  Will they smell your underwear?  They can smell mine.  I don't give a fuck.  All right.  Fair enough.  There we go.  See that?  We moved things right along here.  That's the show.  Let's get back on track, guys.  Jesus.  Let's get back on track.  All right.  We've gotten wayward.  Poor guy's just waiting for his lap dance.  I know, right?  He's sitting there.  That's Dave.  Here, am I not getting a dance?  What's that?  I'm going to get chipped.  Oh, what's that?  Oh.  Damn it.  What are we doing here?  Come on.  Come on, Sal. 
[03:13:30]  You want to move on to another one?  Sal's shaking his head.  Yeah, the lap dance thing's not going to work.  Over the underwear mutual fondling?  That sounds good.  Over the underwear.  That means you've got to shove your hand down the front of his pants.  I've got to say, Sal looks like he's having a nervous breakdown.  He's a sweaty mess.  There's something in his eyes that isn't.  You all right, Sal?  No, I'm not going to.  Let's bring up some feelings, huh?  No.  The worst is yet to come. 
[03:14:00]  This is ONA's Worst of 2013.  2013.  On the O.B.  and Anthony channel.  O.B.  and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  How about this?  Maybe this.  We have to improv a little.  It's getting late.  So Sal doesn't want to do anything.  How about would Sal be willing to pull the side of his thong aside? 
[03:14:30]  Maybe Troy.  And then these guys have to do like a little nose brush against the ass cheek.  Against the ass cheek or the asshole?  Not the asshole, the ass cheek.  But the asshole will be there.  Jimmy's great at improv.  The asshole will be there.  But no, you've got to touch it.  Of course it will.  It's talking right now.  Wait a minute.  That's me.  Fair cock, sucker.  Oh, Jesus.  He's a garbage.  Go home.  Ex.  So they don't touch your asshole. 
[03:15:00]  They just touch the outside of the cheek.  What's the big deal about a cheek?  Well, the cheek, your asshole is spread right there.  And they go to the nose, lightly brushed over the cheek.  How about we go for cock handshake?  Well, that's going to be coming up.  Sword fights.  We're going to do a cock handshake.  We've got to do something.  What's a cock handshake?  You want to do some docking?  You shake each other's cocks like it's their hand.  No, I'm not touching anyone else's dick.  Why?  Like, how do you do?  No, no, no, no.  We'll allow you to wear gloves.  He's stuck in traffic this guy.  No, no, no, no, no.  Gloves. 
[03:15:30]  It's just, it's, no.  We'll allow you to wear gloves.  I don't want to touch anybody's dick.  You don't have to touch anybody's dick.  With the glove?  No, with the asshole sniffing.  I think a little asshole sniffing.  We're all on different pages.  Yeah, I know.  Let's get some asshole sniffing.  We're all just standing around with, unfortunately, not our dicks in our hands.  Let's get some asshole sniffing going.  Let's pep this place up into a mood of fun and festivity for Valentine's Day.  Am I right or wrong, Sam?  You're right.  No one's doing anything.  All right.  What is it?  Asshole sniffing.  A little asshole sniffing. 
[03:16:00]  We'll all enjoy that.  How does this work, Jimmy?  Um, Sal and Troy, they both stand there with their assholes open, and these guys just  go over and take a nice deep sniff of each one.  I say, here we go.  Let's revise this.  How about, how about, nose to asshole for 30 seconds.  30 seconds.  Whoa.  That's good.  That's a long time.  That's a long time.  I mean, if we're stepping it up, let's step it up.  Yeah, well, you know what?  Troy's right, Sam.  Has set in true bumper sticker fashion.  You gotta step up. 
[03:16:30]  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Nose to asshole.  $1,500 at stake.  We can't just hand that away.  All right.  Let's do it.  And you're first.  Okay.  Sal.  This feather means nothing.  This feather does start laughing at this.  Nothing.  Mm-hmm.  Whose asshole are we getting used first?  Oh, my God.  When did you shower last?  Look at me.  It's a sweaty mess.  This morning.  It doesn't matter.  Whoever's getting this is not going to be happy.  I showered this morning, but I took a dump, too.  So, I'm a little, I'm a little.  You're a little gamey?  Yeah, no, like here.  Okay, how about the nose has to be really right up into the asshole? 
[03:17:00]  It doesn't have to actually touch the asshole.  It can just be right there.  I say, I say touching.  Troy, you rule.  Troy, you rule.  I say seat back.  Yep.  So, turn it around.  I think you should give him Arabian goggles and put your asshole on his nose.  What's Arabian goggles?  That's the balls.  The balls right on the eyes.  We used to call it the Arabs to deserve that.  Arabian goggles.  What was that? 
[03:17:30]  That was called the what?  The Roman war helmet.  Yeah.  The Roman war helmet is when the penis is going down the nose.  So, what is your variation?  The balls just resting on the eyes.  Oh, the asshole on the nose.  And that's where the dick could be over the head like a skunk.  All right.  Arabian goggles.  He's ready.  You don't give a fuck.  I sure don't want to wear goggles in Arabia.  Troy, you seem a bit more game.  We might have to just ask you to step up.  You seem to be the guy for the job.  Sal's hemming and hawing over here.  Sal, you would do this one.  There's no time for hemming and hawing.  Am I putting my ass like... 
[03:18:00]  You're pulling your thong aside and you're putting your asshole right...  Not roughly against his nose.  Just gently.  Let him get a good deep sniff in there for 30 seconds.  Stop hemming and hawing.  Let's go.  Am I going to keep track of time?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Pull that thong aside.  Sal, you ready?  Oh, jeez.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, fuck.  How many times are we going to see Sal's ass?  This is terrible.  It's just like a little paper from...  Heather, what are you saying?  It's like toilet paper on his ass.  No, it's not. 
[03:18:30]  It's from being wiped out.  The bronze are being wiped off.  Okay.  Yeah.  How about the music?  Eric, what are you doing?  Stop lollygagging in there.  Having fun.  You're the official DJ of the one and done day off.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, wonderful.  There you go.  Why are you giving him the music?  Give Sal the music, baby.  He's going to be dancing.  Pull it past that.  You don't have to dance.  And what?  The balls go on his eyes?  Yeah.  Put your head back, sir.  No, hang your head back.  Take the dumb headphones off.  This isn't a dentist. 
[03:19:00]  What the fuck's he doing?  Jesus Christ.  Headphones.  The dentist.  Why don't you enjoy it?  Why don't you give him cyber goggles?  Put your asshole on his face.  Ah.  Ah, yes.  Plop right down, buddy.  Yes, Sal.  Plop right down.  Don't put your full weight on him.  Just enough for him to smell.  Go ahead.  Get in there.  Stay here for 30 seconds.  Come on.  Stop being coy.  I'm good.  Come on, Sal.  There you go.  Perfect.  Never getting in the radio hall of fame. 
[03:19:30]  He's got to breathe.  Fuck.  No, he doesn't have to breathe.  Yeah, he's got his mouth.  Oh, my God.  30 seconds.  He's got his.  What the fuck is going on?  Atta boy, Sal.  Atta boy.  This is terrible.  Absolutely.  This guy's a trooper.  Talk to Dave.  20 seconds.  Dave, how is it?  My asshole is.  No, you've got to answer, Dave.  I'm going to talk.  It's wonderful.  Keep talking.  You can even do a plug for whatever.  I don't give a fuck.  30 seconds.  Good boy.  Dave, you're up.  You move on to the next round. 
[03:20:00]  You don't need wet naps.  Your balls are fine, Sal.  Don't make that.  I couldn't imagine.  What?  It's all assy?  It smells like ass over there.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck, man.  I would offer my asshole, but, jeez, they'd be lining up for it.  All right.  Who's there?  Sal, you want to pick your next guy?  No.  Remember the lesbian cow jump?  Remember those chicks?  They'd all be naked, right?  And they're on the couch.  That's it, sir.  Are you?  Yeah.  And they were licking each other's boxes.  Yeah, this is better. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  And making out and groping.  That's about true.  Actually, finger penetration.  Two girls.  That's about ten years ago.  Get all the way back there, sir.  It's been this way for ten years now.  Yeah.  Fuck.  The sound.  Wait, by the way.  It's a new breed here.  All right.  Yeah, this is a new day.  Oh, yeah.  You okay?  Sure.  Stop asking if they're okay.  They're here.  Yeah, what the fuck?  You're right.  You're right.  Who are you?  Fucking Oprah?  You okay?  What are you feeling?  I'm worried about their feelings.  Just move your thong inside.  Yeah, just like that.  This is your favorite.  No, your favorite guy is up there. 
[03:21:00]  Wait, oh.  What happened?  This is much funnier from this side.  Oh, my God.  Where are we at?  Six seconds.  Fuck.  Have him talk.  The contestant there.  Yeah, how are you doing down there?  No, you got to answer.  It's a radio show.  Have you ever done this before?  Yeah, once or twice.  How does it smell?  I'm not using my nose at all.  See, these guys aren't breathing.  No, I'm talking to you, so I'm breathing. 
[03:21:30]  Get out of there, Sal.  Don't move away.  Ant, would you do that?  His asshole is running.  No way.  Whose wife is this?  Not.  She's the Asian girl.  She's fine?  Japanese.  Are you all right with that?  Oh.  You okay with that?  Yeah, I'm okay.  She's okay with it.  Not really, though.  Yeah, no, she's fine.  Nah, she's a little flustered.  Yeah, a little flustered.  Yeah, she's unhappy.  You can tap out.  Are you unhappy?  Is it hard to watch your husband do this?  No, I've never seen a gay... 
[03:22:00]  No, no, gay.  You've never seen gay acts?  Right.  Well, welcome to the show.  How about that?  Yeah.  All right, let's go with the other...  What did you use to use that wipe on?  Because his goatee was itching my ass.  It was kind of gross.  Wait, you wiped your asshole with a Clorox?  I don't know.  Just on the...  Not my asshole.  Okay.  Good boy.  I don't know.  Why are you getting rid of the scent?  I know.  What are you doing, Sal?  I'm sure the scent is there.  Holy fuck.  Another man's goatee is itching south.  Tall on the man's nose.  All right.  Fucking A.  Who's next? 
[03:22:30]  Do you want to go next or do you want to...  Whoever won't?  Wait, we only did two guys?  Yeah, we get two more to go.  Look at the positive.  There's two more to go.  Is it going well, you think?  I don't know, man.  I'd rather chicks in here, to be honest with you.  No, I understand that part of it.  But as far as, like, if we're committing to this...  Yeah, I mean, this is going to drag out for a long time.  That's why I said...  Because these guys are in for the fucking haul.  Somebody's got to either fuck them in the ass or jerk them off or something because...  All right, let's go.  Here's contestant number three.  Remember how Sal said he wouldn't do any of this stuff, by the way? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead, Sal.  You're doing good, Sal.  Get that thong aside.  Let me see some sugar.  Sugar.  Let me see some sugar.  How is that, sir?  How are you doing, Sal?  Bleachy.  It's quite bleachy, though.  I appreciate it.  We bleached it.  I can't believe Sal wiped his ass with bleach.  Maybe Troy should be up to that.  Yeah, we might have to go to the bullpen.  We might have to go to the bullpen. 
[03:23:30]  We might have to.  Troy's not happy, but we're calling in the left-hander.  Calling in the southpaw.  Calling in the left-hander.  Come on, let's go.  Left-hander's stepping up.  We're calling in the closer.  We're calling in the sandman.  Rivera's coming in.  The closer.  You just need one out.  That's all you need.  You don't put bleach on your asshole and a man's going to smell it.  This ass change is being brought to you by a privilege in age.  Yeah.  Troy's not happy.  No.  God damn it.  Troy's like the guy that's got to come.  He's like the wolf.  He's got to come in and clean up.  You don't like that he used bleach?  No. 
[03:24:00]  It's everything up.  That's like a performance-enhancing drug.  It really is.  You don't do that.  All right.  Are we rolling?  Obviously, he's not using growth hormones.  It's sort of wafting.  See, that's how you do it.  Yeah, Troy is rubbing his asshole in this guy's face.  Talk to the guy.  How you doing down there, sir?  Oh, yeah.  He goes, oh, no.  That's how it is.  Oh, my God.  He's up there, too. 
[03:24:30]  Take a big whiff, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  What are you thinking?  Oh, yeah.  Get some coffee, too.  10 seconds.  That's a coffee.  Wow.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is fantastic.  All right.  That's 30.  Attaboy.  Oh.  How was that, sir?  This is what this program needs.  Does it?  Absolutely.  Set us right back on the straight and narrow.  Good job.  We'll do the white wipe now.  How was that?  Was it bad?  That was pretty nasty, actually.  Now, let's talk to the air.  Wait.  Who's your wife?  What's your wife?  What's your name? 
[03:25:00]  Lon.  What?  Lon.  You all right with that?  Well, I mean, if he's doing it, it's not me.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm going to be okay with that for you.  I've been there.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Lon's a good egg.  All right.  That's a good egg.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  When we're face sitting, that's where you begin, right?  There you go.  That's true.  Fair enough.  That's where the road starts.  Cornerstone of any.  The old dirt road.  Cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.  Okay.  Who's next?  All right.  Good luck to you, sir.  Oh.  Attaboy.  Sit back and enjoy.  Lucky devil.  That's where I'm going to. 
[03:25:30]  All the way back.  All the way back.  Are you going to get jealous, Sal?  Because this was your favorite guy.  Oh, I have another idea for them after this.  All right.  Ready?  Are we ready?  Are we ready?  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  Here we go.  Oh, God.  He pulled his...  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  This is the worst.  Dude, this asshole.  It's right there.  He's bouncing up and down on the guy's face.  He pulled his ass... 
[03:26:00]  Oh, he's pulling him into him.  This is...  I don't understand how this...  How guys do this.  This is snot.  How does a guy do this?  All right.  That's 30.  All right.  All right.  Where's the wife?  We've got to talk to the wife.  How was it?  Deep in his ass room.  Oh, my God.  You weren't buried.  Is that all right?  I can't believe he did that.  My nose was in his ass.  Do you smell ass now?  Oh, my God.  Are you smelling ass?  Wait.  Wait.  I'm showing you fucking things out. 
[03:26:30]  Hold on.  The wife is a little...  She's a little flustered by this one.  You all right?  They have to smell that.  Holy shit.  I can't...  Oh, my God.  You all right?  Yeah.  I'm fine.  Have you ever done that to him?  What?  You've never sat right there and...  You could tap out...  Sure, I have.  She could tap out for him.  Yeah, you could tap out if you don't want to see...  I've seen another guy do it.  Yeah.  It's pretty sick, right?  You like it or is it uncomfortable?  Well, uncomfortable.  Oh.  As long as he was okay with it, though.  Cool.  But you're like, eh, you're not into that, huh?  You're fucking...  Now, how about this? 
[03:27:00]  Well, we got the chocolate sauce, Jimmy.  Let's not forget.  Oh, you know what?  We got the chocolate sauce.  If you can work that into what you're thinking.  Absolutely.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't know.  A little chocolate sauce.  I was thinking...  Are you sweaty?  Am I sweaty?  Yeah.  Your underarm's sweaty?  A little bit.  How about you?  No.  All right.  Cool as a cucumber, that Troy Kwan.  Troy...  Oh, I have an idea.  Okay.  Maybe...  How about chocolate sauce, and you see how far, you know... 
[03:27:30]  Or how about you have to spend 30 seconds kissing the armpit of another contestant?  A little armpit kissing is completely harmless, but I think that there's four contestants,  and I think they can kiss each other's armpits.  Why not?  It's a gay off.  Can we get a train going on?  You know what?  Fucking Troy.  Hey.  You know what?  There we go.  Just throwing ideas out there.  We put our heads together, and we're going to get this shit back on track.  Let's get the show back on track, guys.  Are you armpit kissing? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  We can figure it out.  How do we go from that to what you're suggesting?  Well...  We can just have a dance-off or something.  Then the other one lifts up the other one, so that one's licking one while the other's  getting licked, and then we'll go in a circle.  A daisy chain.  That's a great idea.  It's all random.  It's all fair.  That's a great idea, huh?  Everyone gets to enjoy themselves.  Yeah.  I'm walking around with his bag.  His bag's hanging out of the side of his...  Do you know how great this is?  No.  No.  I don't.  I actually don't.  Oh, my God.  I think we officially lost Dice.  Oh, of course we did. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, Dice, he couldn't put up with that.  Yeah.  All right, what are we doing?  Hi, Sal.  Good job, buddy.  Not really.  What are we doing?  It wasn't, it wasn't.  No.  So what are we doing?  Let's get everybody...  Let somebody run the show.  Let's go.  Everybody get in there with those.  You don't even need that yet.  That will kill the taste.  I want natural man flavor.  So Sal should be the bottom of the show at the top, then.  No, this is all within contestants.  Nothing to do with us. 
[03:29:00]  We're more...  Sam.  No, that's not true.  They're all going to be in a circle.  It's a chain, Sam.  Yeah.  Yes.  Four of them smelling and licking.  Four men being men.  Like the old days.  Everyone arms up.  Arms up.  Yeah.  This should be more of a circle.  Are we filming this?  Oh my God.  Why not?  Hopefully not.  Why are we not filming this?  Put your head near him.  Don't start yet.  You put your head near...  No, no.  You put your head near his pit.  Oh my God.  Get a towel.  You put your head near his pit.  Somebody film it.  Sal, film it.  Somebody. 
[03:29:30]  There's the camera.  Don't give it to Sal.  That means he's not going to do anything else.  This would be easier with...  No, no, no.  You don't stand in a circle.  You just...  How are we supposed to see that?  You're not huddling...  If you're not in a circle, one of them isn't going to...  Yeah, then how many two of them are going to get the full enchilada?  One, lick.  Next one, lift, lick.  Yeah, they don't have to be in a...  They're not huddling...  Oh, you don't want to do it at the same time?  No, who cares?  Oh, I thought we were doing it all at the same time.  No, you just line them up.  Like, and you could be a big circle.  We have to see what's happening so we can describe it.  How about one starts and licks all of them down and then it goes around? 
[03:30:00]  There you go.  How long per each person?  15 seconds.  But it has to be full licking and putting your face in there.  Yeah.  Each person.  Yeah.  Each person, you go down and then it starts back around.  He's here.  Okay.  Who's here?  Oh, here he is.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Go-Go's here.  Go-Go-Go.  It's about time.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Hi, Go-Go.  Hi.  How's it going?  Should I get naked now or...  Hurry.  That's the attitude we need in here.  Oh, my God. 
[03:30:30]  We all had to step up here.  Fill it in for you, buddy.  There's been a lot of improv-ing and uncomfortable behavior so far.  Is that poo or is that chocolate on him?  Bronzer.  That's bronzer.  Because not all gays like poo, and I would be one of those.  No, it's just bronzer.  It's just bronzer.  Okay.  Nicely done.  Yeah.  Looking good, right?  Yeah.  Well, welcome to the show.  Thank you.  Go-Go harder.  Sorry, I had to fluff myself, and it just took longer than I thought.  Oh, well.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Serious.  Let's do it.  Come on.  Let's get the show on the road, buddy.  All right.  Oh, man. 
[03:31:00]  He's ready.  His nipples are pierced.  He's ready to go.  Yeah.  Come on.  Here.  Yeah.  All right.  So, what do we want to do now?  Now, I still say we finished that one armpit licking idea.  I think that's a good one.  All right.  Oh, are these the guys?  Yeah.  They don't look straight.  Really?  Can you tell if you're doing it to somebody, if they're actually enjoying it, and they're  just pretending they don't like it?  Well, usually they pay, so I assume that they're liking it.  Unless it's like a, you know, I don't know, a joke or a dare or something like that.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh. 
[03:31:30]  So.  All right.  Is there some music?  Yeah, really.  We got to like...  What are you doing in my dick in your face?  Wow.  Jesus.  That's what management said when we signed the contract.  Where were you an hour ago?  Oh.  Where were you?  This way.  Sounds like, where were you all my life?  Do you mind getting naked for the guys?  No.  Why not?  I mean, I kind of feel like I have to do it again.  It's all out right now.  He's just naked for the guys.  I mean, at this point, we're balls deep, so let's...  That's for the guys.  Oh.  There we go.  He's got a big bag.  He's all bagged this guy.  Ladies and ladies. 
[03:32:00]  I have a big bag.  It's beautiful.  It's pierced, too, actually.  It's beautiful.  Is it?  It is.  Yeah.  I know.  How about crazy?  What's the gist of this one?  What are we doing now?  I think we should...  I think personally...  We should fast forward.  We should fast forward.  We should skip this.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And get to some of the...  Okay.  Hardcore.  Well, we've got the dry humping left.  What else?  Well...  That's hardcore.  Sing a soft kissing.  We've got the chocolate sauce.  I mean, as a straight man, like, what is, like, a danger zone for you? 
[03:32:30]  Like, what's the...  Well...  We did the asshole on the nose.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  None of them liked it, but they took it.  You guys are so crazy.  No dick and balls, but asshole.  I guess it's because every straight man still kind of likes his asshole.  How about you just beat their faces with your bag like a blackjack?  Yeah.  A cock slap across the cheek just to show them was boss.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Slap across the cheek.  Let's get our chair back.  What about on the knee? 
[03:33:00]  No, they should be kneeling.  Ah, kneeling.  Oh, God.  Kneeling.  All right.  That's pretty bad.  Yeah, you know, all these guys get naked with them?  I think they should be.  I mean, what is this guy by himself?  Exactly, right?  But he should make their clothes off for him.  Okay.  So far beyond...  You don't mind taking their clothes off?  I'm just watching you at this point.  Okay.  I told you to be good.  Let's start here and let's...  Yeah.  Yeah, go, go, hard.  He's late, but he's a trooper.  What's happening now?  What are you doing?  I'm putting on my pants.  Why?  Take your pants off.  It's the kid with the vibe, bro.  You're his helper.  I can't take it anymore. 
[03:33:30]  Wait, you know what that means?  Like Ope said, it's not naked.  No, I know what that means.  He's...  All right.  Oh, he's getting excited.  He's covering up.  Are you getting a rod?  Oh, you're covering up your rod.  Oh, yeah.  He's in the closet.  You're an asshole.  Maybe you can help him come flying out.  Yeah.  Sal, what are you doing?  You're his helper.  Sal, you're covering your rod.  Yeah, that's why I'm covering my rod.  No, I just...  Ah, boy.  Okay, well, Go-Go's here, so that's fine.  Is that a tattoo?  Is that a tattoo, or is that a tattoo?  Is that more bad ideas?  Okay.  All right, let's do this.  Is that a tattoo?  Come over here, straight boy. 
[03:34:00]  So, is it...  They're just gonna, like, tap out when they're like,  you can't handle this anymore, right?  Yeah, you should have your shoes here, buddy.  I think they're going to go right off.  Yeah, guys, get these shoes off.  For Pete's sake, let's move the show.  This is for Valentine's Day, huh?  Yeah, we're gonna go late today.  It's fine.  This is our Valentine's Day fucking promotion.  Oh, are you really?  Oh, my God.  Well, in that case...  Oh!  He's kissing and licking his neck.  Ah, he's kissing and licking his neck.  Yeah, oh, he's...  He's around the back.  He's tweaking his nipples.  Oh, he's playing with his nipples. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, he's licking his body.  Game on.  Yeah, yeah, this guy's a fucking professional.  What's going on there?  It's delicious.  He's pulling his jeans down.  Oh, my God.  I'm going in.  Really?  Yeah, he's licking his...  It's inverting now.  This guy is the real deal.  You keep telling yourself that.  Kissing his stomach all the way down.  Check and see if there's some blood flow going on down there.  He's kissing it.  Oh, I am...  Too bad.  No, nothing.  Looking at his cock.  Nothing, huh?  Okay. 
[03:35:00]  All right, let's get it all down.  Oh, no.  There we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened?  Talk to the wife.  He's going to be getting paid at all for this.  Talk to the wife, yes.  They win the contest.  They win money.  Oh, okay.  How much is on the line?  I am just beyond...  Who's guy is this?  How you doing, Lon?  Is that...  He's tickling their bag.  He's playing with his bag.  Oh, my God.  It really is getting smaller right now.  That's amazing.  I can feel straight.  I've never seen this before.  It's a pretty straight cock, yeah.  He's turning white. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, it's...  Nothing's happening.  He's going to pass out.  Should I move on to the next one?  She's fine.  Okay.  He's got some ones.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  Keep your trousers down.  Keep your trousers down for the love of God.  Wow.  All right, this is Dave.  Dave is the next.  Come aboard, Dave.  Come on, Ant.  We're all having fun.  Get that camera on, these people.  I don't know how this went.  Oh, come on.  Here we go.  Come on, Ant.  Dave has Archie Bunker underwear.  Jesus.  I'm actually kind of leaning in.  Whose wife is yours?  The red.  Okay.  Oh, hey.  You're very pretty.  Is that a mole? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  It might be cancer.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  It totally went away.  Yeah, see?  It went away.  Oh, no.  What is that?  It's a guy from the gym, okay?  Well, that's cool.  He's tickling his bag again.  I feel like tickling is just going to make it go back in, though.  It might.  Oh, my God.  His penis is shy.  It's like...  I washed my hands.  It's a groundhog.  Checking for a hernia.  I'm in porn, and this is happening to me right now.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Oh, my God.  I think he's good.  He's just holding his balls. 
[03:36:30]  Playing with his nipples.  I feel like these guys are really, like, are real pros right now.  I mean...  Yeah, why don't you go in and kiss like you were doing over there?  Yeah, on the neck.  He's like, yeah, just kiss.  All right, well, do you have anything?  Like, like, oh, no, I'm saying you're, like, neck and, like...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You guys want to make out.  Go ahead.  You guys want to make out.  Go ahead.  Well, you know, it's been a couple of days, so why not?  Oh!  He's making out with that one.  There's two guys making out.  Absolutely.  Two men.  Two men are making out.  You better kiss her than that.  She can't fall, but it's hilarious.  Heather, you all right with that? 
[03:37:00]  I'm fine.  He was laughing in the whole list.  Oh, my God.  He's tickling his bag.  They're making out, and he's tickling his bag.  Jesus Christ.  He's holding his balls.  I can't believe I gave this this guy.  I know.  Well, it's the game.  First annual.  Yeah, but somebody's jealous he didn't get a kiss on the lips.  Oh.  Can you kiss him on his lips, too?  Are you jealous?  Tickle his bag.  Tickle his bag.  Give him a kiss on the lips.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  He's kissing his lips.  This is what this is.  Atta boy.  The professional has arrived.  I think he's more attracted to him than he has to my husband. 
[03:37:30]  What, Heather?  You're not as attracted to my husband as you are.  No, you're as cute.  I like his furry chest.  I mean, yeah.  He's a better kisser than the other guy, if it makes you feel better.  Who's your wife?  Where is his wife?  I'm stunned.  I'm sure he kisses you better than me.  I'm like a fucking baby seal on an ice balloon who just took a mallet over the head.  It's been leading to this day for many years.  Absolutely.  After today, it's over.  It's over.  I think we should do another one of these Friday when I'm back. 
[03:38:00]  No, no.  Oh, God.  This guy's helping me take his energy out.  Let's get over with, guy.  I kind of...  All right.  This is the one where I kind of...  He's a real go-getter, isn't he?  Yeah.  Go-getter.  He's wearing fucking skinny jeans.  How is this even...  I feel like he just went into the eagle and pulled...  The E-shape.  Is that one of the clubs?  This guy is subtly telling me that he's actually like a swinger and he and his...  He's just playing with his balls.  He really is.  Yeah, he's really manipulating my...  Oh, and his wife is looking... 
[03:38:30]  Are you really a sister?  Am I a sister?  Yeah.  I'm his wife.  Oh, okay.  A sister.  Is it hard for you to watch this?  No.  Okay.  No, because it's their Friday routine.  Oh, okay.  He's actually...  No.  He's chopping up a little bit.  He's kissing his neck.  I feel normal.  All right.  He's licking his nipple.  Oh, what's the wife saying?  I can't say anything.  I don't know what to even say.  Hold on.  Let the wife say it.  Get over there.  Let her say it.  Let her say it.  In all these years, we've got something going on in the studio.  I don't...  I can't talk. 
[03:39:00]  I don't know what to say.  I know.  All that blood is rushing to your cock.  Jimmy's talking for all of us.  We're good.  He's talking for his penis, playing with his balls.  It's my whole childhood.  This is memories for Jimmy.  Oh, please.  All right, y'all.  Now they're making out.  Oh, he's kissing.  Play with his balls.  And the guy's holding his thing with dirty face.  Oh, my God.  There's men.  Wait, the wife's a little...  You all right, wife?  All right.  I have to say this one is...  I'm dubious.  What do you mean dubious? 
[03:39:30]  He's questionable.  I mean, I just don't...  Yeah, I just don't know.  I feel like...  He's covering it up now, too.  I feel like he's...  I'm not hard.  I just...  There's a little blood flow going down.  There's a little blood flow.  Just a tiny thing.  Troy, how's it going over there?  Is your name Thor?  It's fucking gay over here.  Yeah.  All right, John.  This is John.  All right.  You're a tall man, so I'm hoping for a little...  It's a grower.  Is it?  It's a grower.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  He's all bag.  He's all bag.  He's all bag, this guy.  What, Ant?  I was hoping for a bigger cock.  I'm disappointed when it's like being a big bald man. 
[03:40:00]  You want to make it measure up.  He's manipulating.  He's playing with his cock.  Oh, and John, you are wearing a wedding ring.  Is this a...  Yeah.  Oh, and it feels real, too.  Oh, he's touching his wedding ring and his dick.  Wow.  He touched his wedding ring and his dick at the same time.  We got to be fair to this contestant.  You got to make out with him and play with his bag.  Yeah, give him a kiss.  There we go.  There we go.  All right.  I'm not even going to miss you, huh?  I'm not going to kiss. 
[03:40:30]  I'm getting a lot of teeth right now.  You get a lot of teeth.  What kind of...  Where's the wife?  I'm not going to kiss.  You all right?  How you doing?  He's playing with his nipples.  Babe, what did you get me for a clown?  The...  Abercrombie.  Abercrombie.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Abercrombie and Fitch like fierce.  He's wearing Abercrombie cologne to the gay office.  What a trooper.  That's like deer musk for gays.  Well, they look like they... 
[03:41:00]  No, we got plenty of time.  Jim Norton.  We'll do the Jim Norton show Friday.  This is acceptable.  We're kind of doing the Jim Norton show.  I feel like they all passed this.  Who are you kidding?  Okay, so they got through this round.  What's next?  Well, I don't know.  I mean...  How do you follow that?  How do you follow that?  Oh, jeez.  Well...  What do you want to do?  What do you think?  I...  I...  He wants to go home.  No, no.  He doesn't have any...  I...  What do we do?  He's tapping into something for him.  No one has tapped out. 
[03:41:30]  No, these guys have provided $1,500 at stake.  I really would have thought somebody would have tapped out.  No, why would they?  For that mild behavior?  What's left there, sir?  I mean...  You're right.  What's that?  If we pour...  We're going to tap out.  They're going to go the distance.  What about on me?  What about...  Yeah.  Don't you have chocolate syrup?  Yeah, should we pour some chocolate syrup on the go-go? 
[03:42:00]  I have time for breakfast this morning.  Okay, so...  This will end...  ...with some type of oral or anal sex.  No, no, we can't do that.  He's a great tattoo.  What?  What's the tattoo?  Is that of you on your arm, or is this a guy?  It's a Tom of Finland.  What's a Tom of Finland?  He's a famous pornographer from the 50s and 60s.  It's the chair you set up.  Yeah, Google him.  Check him out.  He's naked.  He's naked on the chair.  You're interviewing me naked in your chair.  In your morning coffee chair. 
[03:42:30]  Okay, so...  Throw it out.  What happened to dice?  Where did the dice go?  I don't know.  It should be scales.  You know what I mean?  It should start maybe on the collarbone, and then go lower.  They're all going to lick that.  It has to be going up your thigh to your bag.  Okay, sure.  Should they do it with chocolate or without chocolate?  I almost think chocolate is very easy,  whereas the taste of the hair and of a man's leg is a little bit harder.  That's a little bit harder.  Jim, good experience, though, just from what you haven't seen.  Yeah, yeah, just from what I've heard.  I wouldn't like chocolate syrup anyway. 
[03:43:00]  I almost think that that would be harder to do without it.  Okay.  Okay.  Good call.  Would you do it with or without it?  I'll give you the choice.  No, because they're going to say the easiest one.  No, of course.  I'm going to lie.  That's for using psychology.  Yeah, I think without anything makes it a little bit harder  because it's a little bit more real.  We're really tapping into the fears of the heterosexual man right now.  I got it.  Sure.  One goes up one thigh, one goes up the other, contestant-wise,  and then they make out right over his dick.  You know what, Troy?  Oh, my God.  From your lips to God's ears. 
[03:43:30]  All right, let's do it.  I'll stand.  Let's do it.  I'll stand.  That's the attitude we need around here, Sal.  First two over here.  Let's do it.  I'll stand.  Guys, you can tap at any time.  Yeah, exactly.  How long are we doing it for?  One minute.  Wait a minute.  One minute.  And that doesn't include the licking, by the way.  One minute once you get to the ball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Hold on.  Who do we got?  Can they stand with his back?  Playing the parts of Opie and Anthony are Troy.  Can he stand his back to us so the wives can see? 
[03:44:00]  The wives should be able to see all this, too.  Yeah, they need to see this.  Somebody's got to take the reins here.  Yeah.  I'm trying, Troy.  I'm just trying.  Let's get Travis.  Pull that chair back, and let's see if we can get this guy in the middle here,  and let's see if we can get these wives.  I want the wives to see this.  The wives should see.  Why should we be so lucky?  Okay.  So one guy over here.  Right here.  Yes.  And one guy over there.  Okay.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Come on, Troy.  I can't see.  Oh, sorry.  Get down on your knees.  Oh, my God.  What? 
[03:44:30]  This contest wasn't even my idea.  This was not my idea, this contest.  No, no.  We're not saying it was.  Okay.  I don't know who it was.  I just happen to be pushing the action.  That's my idea.  Good idea, Sam.  Good one, Sam.  Enjoy.  Okay, so I'd say start at the knees, inside the thigh.  Go up.  Absolutely.  Right?  You talk on that side, though, just so that the pal-talk cameras and Ant can see.  Ant?  Hi.  No, no, don't touch me.  Okay, we ready to go? 
[03:45:00]  No, I tap out.  Okay.  There it is.  Oh!  We got a tap out.  Another one.  Who did we lose?  We lost Dennis.  Dennis tapped out.  Dennis is out.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  Kiss another guy on his thighs like that.  Right in front of a cock?  Yeah, that's a rough one.  That's a rough one.  We're down to three guys.  Dennis, I thought you were in it to win it.  I thought you and your wife were going to, like, approach me.  No.  Oh, God.  And then when they make out, they have to feel his dick on, like, their cheeks.  Absolutely.  Of course. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, that goes without saying, Sam.  Slap him in the face.  Why would you do it without that?  You're a professional.  We don't need to tell you what to do.  That was dumb.  All right.  Exactly.  Don't tell this man his business.  So we got Dave and John on their knees in front of Go-Go Harder.  So what's going to happen, Jimmy?  Can you turn back a little bit so we can kind of see?  Sure.  Okay.  Now you can come over here.  No, it's right over here.  Yeah, this way the wives can see.  Perfect.  Now you have to get over there, my friend.  They're going to...  What are they doing, Troy?  Okay.  They're going to start licking in his inner thigh by his knee.  Oh, perfect. 
[03:46:00]  Lick.  Lick.  They're going to go up to where his dick is, and they're going to make out right in front  of his dick for one minute, and he's going to slap him in the face with his dick.  Oh, I hope so.  All right, good.  While they make out.  And the wives are cool with this?  Wives, you can tap out.  Now the height's one of the wives, and who else?  Yep.  But why don't we see how it goes?  Why don't you start?  You don't tap out before you start.  If it gets uncomfortable, you can tap out.  We're not going to rape you.  Is it like a tag team where the wives can jump in?  No, they just have the wives.  No, I'm just kidding.  What?  Oh, God. 
[03:46:30]  All right, gentlemen.  Let's go.  All right.  All right, guys.  Come on.  Do you guys have your...  Are you going to tap, or are you going to...  Can you hang?  Are you ready to do this?  Yeah, I guess.  All right.  Good.  Make out for me.  And when you guys are making out...  What is going on right now?  Nothing yet, Sal, but the action's starting.  Don't get impatient.  When you guys are making out, put your hands around and touch his ass.  Yeah, that's fair.  I also have to, like, touch my taint ring, too.  That's a good idea.  Now we're putting our heads together.  All right, let's just start slow. 
[03:47:00]  Start licking the legs here.  For goodness sake.  Let's get the shoulder.  Come on.  I'm losing my heart on.  Let's go.  Start just...  All right, gentlemen.  Go.  Knock it in there.  Come on.  Oh, gosh.  Oh.  Nice and slow.  Nice and slow.  They're kissing the legs.  I don't want to block your view.  Go up those legs.  These are...  That's good.  Oh.  And he's just shaking, and his penis is moving a little bit.  Make out for a minute.  One minute.  And play with his taint while you're making out.  Yeah, make out.  Play with his...  Get back there.  Play with his taint.  They're kissing... 
[03:47:30]  Jesus fucking Christ.  They're doing it.  He's holding their head.  What a professional.  Holy shit.  He's rubbing his penis kind of between their face.  You can't do any blowjob stuff, but they're not doing that.  What has happened?  Are the wives all right with this?  Talk to the wives.  Heather, you all right with this?  Oh, I'm a little bit.  Keep kissing.  Heather's lightheaded.  Where's the other wife?  20 seconds in.  You got a lot of time to do it.  Yeah.  And I need a real kiss, guys.  Is he swatting them with his dick in it?  Yeah, of course he is.  Just not in the mouth.  Oh, my God.  Rubbing his dick on their head.  On their face.  I know. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, you're not paying attention.  You're missing out on all the fun.  I'm trying to figure out if I have to pick.  Come on, guys.  Make it sexy.  Come on.  I have to pick my kids up.  There you go.  Rubbing it on the cheeks.  And these.  Holy shit.  Oh, in his ear.  Yeah.  That's almost funny.  That's almost funny.  Come on, guys.  There you go.  Can we talk to the wives?  What's going on?  Yeah.  How are the wives doing?  And why aren't they tapping out for their men?  Heather?  I'm, like, pressed against the wall like I'm in a centrifuge.  All right. 
[03:48:30]  Okay, good.  All right.  We got through it.  It's not always on camera.  Sit this way and face over there.  Thank you.  So we got one guy out.  But let's talk to the guys.  How was that?  Yeah, how was it?  How was the action down there?  Go to a happy place.  Huh?  How was it?  Oh, it was fantastic.  Let me tell you.  Now, what are we going to do about the other guy, though?  He didn't get to kiss anybody.  That's a good question.  Sal.  I guess we got to bring Sal back into the mix.  The only thing I can see is a rock, paper, scissors game, and one of these two has to  go twice.  Okay.  Three is an odd number.  It's all you can do.  That is all you can do. 
[03:49:00]  I mean, we're improv-ing as we go.  All right.  So you two rock, paper, scissors, and the winner does not have to do this again.  Oh, see.  I would have done that differently.  Okay.  All right.  The winner doesn't have to do it again.  Rock, paper, scissors.  All right.  Best out of three.  Let's go.  Okay.  I don't know.  It's just rock, paper, scissors.  Yeah.  One.  Do you want to play it?  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't.  One, two, three.  Shoo.  I'm down.  Wait.  Who's down?  You're down?  I'm down one.  One, two, three.  Shoo.  Tie.  Tie.  Tie, one apiece. 
[03:49:30]  It's heating up in here.  One, two, three.  Shoo.  Oh.  One, one.  One, one.  Okay.  He's a tiebreaker.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Shoo.  Oh.  Who won?  He won.  Okay.  So do you choose to kiss again, or do you rather sit this one out?  Well, I wonder if I choose to sit this out, it'll get worse next time.  So.  Well, yeah, you're going out of the next room anyway.  Of course, what do you think, it's going to get better?  You're going out to the next round.  I'll kiss. 
[03:50:00]  Whatever, I'll kiss.  I'll kiss and kiss him.  Okay.  This guy.  There you go.  If he won, doesn't that mean he could have bailed on the kissing?  It doesn't matter.  What the fuck's going on?  He chose to kiss.  I keep thinking this is a nightmare.  Like, it's not really happening.  I'm having a nightmare.  That guy just, he just tapped.  Lon's husband, what's your name again?  The trucker.  Adam tapped.  He tapped because the other dude wanted to make out with him.  Because he volunteered for it.  Good strategy.  Good strategy. 
[03:50:30]  Good strategy.  He tapped.  Yep.  He fucking stebbins from the long walk.  All right.  We're down to two guys.  Two men left.  Wait, Lon, are you disappointed?  We're going to have to step it up here, guys.  It's not up to me.  It's not me in it, so.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up, O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues.  Next.  O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013. 
[03:51:00]  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  Continues right now.  All right.  What the fuck?  What's left?  All right.  Um.  What's left?  Ah, well.  Not a shred of dignity.  Here's the thing.  Sorry.  Can't let them go on my arm, Jimmy.  It's so uncomfortable.  I'm trying to talk to you.  You're being shy.  No.  Troy, are you thinking dance-off?  Dance-off?  I don't know.  Dance-off.  I mean, we have all these props.  I like Sam's idea of the double dildos, yeah?  We have not, no. 
[03:51:30]  No.  What can we do with the dildos?  Do you know any good dildos?  We're on the way.  What's that?  Do you know any good dildo games?  Well, all of them involve going up my ass, so I don't really know that.  How about something that was on the list here?  The guy is funny.  A little toe-sucking.  Toe-sucking, movie man?  That's a nice icebreaker.  Let's do some toe-sucking.  I think we...  I agree.  Oh, sorry.  Jimmy!  I think toe-sucking is important.  We need to do something where it starts to fucking move or whatever. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, let's move it.  Exactly.  We got too out of it.  Toe-sucking, and then they have to, like, massage oil into my cock.  That sounds great.  That's not great.  That's not great.  That's not great.  That's not great.  Cool.  How about...  Well...  It's a sock.  Are they allowed to jerk him off?  Is that okay?  No, it's a massage.  It's a massage.  It's not jerking off.  No, it's not.  It's a massage.  It's a massage.  It's a massage.  It's a massage.  Massage.  Okay.  Can I make a suggestion?  Sure.  Uh-oh. 
[03:52:30]  Contestant on contestant toe-sucking.  What are we going to get to do with him?  That's why he's here.  No, no.  Yeah, he's the pro.  He's a professional.  Go-go harder, Shoga.  Go-go!  No!  You came in, you already stuck each other's toes.  Why would a contestant suggest contestant on contestant?  I know why.  I know why.  Why?  Because he's trying to use the same strategy and hoping that the other guy taps out.  Not going to happen.  No, he's good cheeks.  Jimmy likes your cheeks, go-go.  Okay, so let's...  I did squats yesterday, so...  Let's do a little bit of... 
[03:53:00]  What do you think?  Should it be contestant on contestant or contestant on you?  No, contestant on him.  Well, they got to suck toes and then do an oil massage.  Okay, I got an idea.  Contestant on him.  Yeah, I think his shoes are off.  We'll get ready again.  Why don't we take one of the dildo, put it between his legs, right?  Or put it here, and have them blow the dildo and play with his actual balls.  Oh, Troy.  See, always a good solution.  Compromise is important.  Wait, what's happening?  What about the oil?  Why don't we do that next?  The oil massage first.  Oil massage first.  You start with the oil massage.  Oh, my God, it's like being on a Titanic. 
[03:53:30]  All right, so right now...  I know.  This is crazy.  We could have Sal with the dildo between his legs.  No, I'm good.  No, because Sal's not going to want his balls manipulated.  Sal's nauseous in the corner.  Sal's been shaken to the corner.  Right now, the contestants are going to suck go-go's toes...  As they should.  ...as they massage him with oil.  And then they're going to massage his dick with oil.  Okay.  When they're sucking each other's toes, can they play with each other's balls?  No, they're going to suck his toes.  Okay, but they're sucking his toes, but then they'll play with each other's balls.  Of course they do. 
[03:54:00]  Troy has really stepped up to that.  He's really done well.  Somebody's got to take the main trophy.  I hear you, Troy.  Okay.  Do you want to sit down, though, though?  Some people don't believe Troy when he says he's down for whatever.  Okay, so the way it's going to work is you're going to suck his toes while playing with the other contestants.  How do we get E-Rock involved with this?  Why don't they both suck each foot at the same time?  And then they'll play with each other's balls.  There'll be ball manipulation the entire time.  Wait, she's not happy over there.  You all right with this?  Who's not happy?  Who's not happy?  No, this is taking forever.  Like, there's more discussion than action. 
[03:54:30]  I agree!  Thank you!  Lon is right.  More discussion.  If you're going to give us a show, give us a show.  Come on now.  Too much fucking chatter.  She's right.  Yep.  I agree.  Get on those toes.  Get on those tootsies.  All right, gentlemen.  Get down there.  Be good boys.  Oh, sure.  Quiet.  You're ruining my mood.  Troy, I'll call my parents Mike.  Okay.  So, you guys know what you're doing?  So, you're going to suck his toes and then you're going to play with each other's balls while you're doing it. 
[03:55:00]  Have we established a time?  One minute.  One minute.  An hour and 20 minutes.  Oh.  Troy knows time.  I feel like the stakes aren't high enough, though.  Because it's not, um...  I agree.  I agree.  I feel like they should have to touch my dick or something.  I think so, too.  That's kind of true.  I think so, too.  All right.  All right.  Let's go right to the, the, the, uh...  Bring over the dildo.  Let's have them oil massage his dick first.  Oil massage.  Okay.  He's feeling tense.  Can they both suck his toes and oil massage his dick?  I mean, there's no reason.  These are not mutually exclusive things.  Suck his toes.  Start...  Go all the way up.  And then they'll manipulate you. 
[03:55:30]  There you go.  Give each of them a little...  A massage.  But then maybe they should do it one at a time.  A little oil in their hands.  So that one guy doesn't get any more dick than the other.  They start arguing.  Yeah, but they'll, they'll just, they'll just swap off.  See, Lon's right.  Lon's mad again.  More talking.  Lon's mad.  More discussion than actual action.  I agree.  That's because we're slightly unorganized, sweetheart.  Like, we're figuring it out as we go.  Yeah.  Troy, are you annoyed?  What's that?  Are you annoyed?  Well, because I said this in the goddamn meeting.  I said, these guys are going to do this.  Right.  This is fucking nothing.  It's fun.  We're already having a way down.  No, I know, but this is easy stuff. 
[03:56:00]  Let's go.  Obviously, and for them.  Half the thing, guys have already tapped out.  Yeah, but look at these guys are fucking in for the haul.  Somebody's going to have to get fucked in their ass or blow this dude in order to fucking win.  I was just going to say, what if we lubed up the dildos and just, like, kind of press them against their holes for a while?  Can't do that.  Maybe a little just to touch.  I don't know.  We can't do anything in first year-wise.  We're unallowed.  Let's just start with the kissy.  I don't see any legs being kissed.  What are we going to do? 
[03:56:30]  So, yeah, let's suck toes, guys.  Come on.  Fucks it around.  Get in there and suck some toes.  Lolligagging.  And then we're going to go on up.  Go ahead.  Get in there.  Troy, describe the action.  Okay.  And get in there real good with the toes.  You've got to get in between.  In between the toes.  Don't worry about it.  I do not have fungus.  Come on, guys.  Get in there.  There's a little glitter.  Can you guys reach over and then be playing with each other at the same time?  Yeah, come on.  There's glitter on Go-Go's toes.  All right, come on, guys.  Get a little closer to each other.  Come on.  Get a little closer.  All right, good.  Good.  Maybe put your arm around it.  Maybe one plays with the balls for a while. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  Do it.  Dave, play with his balls.  Good, yeah.  It's essential.  If you're just putting an armor on, I'm like, how do this in any way, shape, or form?  It's unbelievable.  We found four guys to do this.  How does that mean?  I'm amazed.  I know.  We should have raised the stakes.  See, I didn't give a fuck about this whole thing because I'm like, there's no one in our  audience that will do this.  Right.  I was convinced it was going to be one of our ideas that would be a bust.  You're right.  So I'm like, yeah, whatever.  Now work your way out of those legs, guys.  Start working the way out. 
[03:57:30]  Let's get to the cock.  Why can't we get fucking girls to come in?  Now play with each other's tits.  All right.  All right.  Now suck her clit.  It's just fucking...  What's going on, Troy?  Now they're kissing up the leg.  Yeah.  You're making it hot for us.  Is it hot?  Oh, yeah.  It's steamy.  One better than the other.  Oh, Jesus.  I think it's the Abercrombie and Fitch.  Although I can really tell that this other guy is just doing his best.  Like, he's really coming from the heart right now.  You know what I mean?  Why do you make this big crap?  It's because I care.  Right?  Heather Heights has been dead. 
[03:58:00]  Maybe go ahead and kiss it a little bit.  Jesus Christ.  They are working their way.  They are now at the, like, just about the hips.  Yeah.  There we go.  On each side.  Yeah.  There we go.  The one guy who has a lot of his hands wrapped around the leg.  He's a trooper.  This is like what happens in prison.  It is.  This is amazing.  They went up the cock.  Now we've got to get the lotion out.  Oh, jeez.  Here's the massage lotion.  Here we go.  We're going to pour it all over you, okay?  Here we go.  Yeah, he'll do it himself.  Put it in his hand.  He's massaging his own...  Okay, all of your hands.  All right, let's do this.  Yeah, on their hands.  Now, just get in there and manipulate him, and then you guys make out. 
[03:58:30]  Get in there!  Grab that cock!  Do it!  What are you doing?  Uh-oh.  Lon's mad again.  Hold on.  You grab the balls.  You grab the balls.  Hold on.  The ladies want to get a view of their husbands.  These guys...  Make out!  Treat it like it was your own.  Come on.  It's not the first time.  You guys got to kiss each other on the map now.  Yeah, what are you guys doing?  Again?  How am I supposed to get a heart on with this?  Go.  Kiss.  Now, make out. 
[03:59:00]  What the fuck happened?  Keep going.  You can't say what the fuck.  It's going to destroy you.  Keep going.  Kiss him.  Oh, God.  That's gross.  I can't...  I...  Worst stroking ever.  I know, right?  Yeah, what are they doing?  I don't know.  They're just...  They're just mashing it out.  And kiss a little more.  He's working on like a baster bulb.  He's just like...  Put a condom on each side and let them blow the double-headed dildo while they're playing  with his dick.  Oh, yeah.  Is it time to play Lady and the Tramp?  Troy is... 
[03:59:30]  Troy is the worst, man.  Troy is a great gay porn director.  He certainly is.  Although...  I'm stepping up, gentlemen.  Troy knew this was lacking, and he said, fuck it, I'll step up.  I would say that Go-Go is not impressed with their cock-handling skills at all.  I'm not.  I mean, I feel a little stirring, but I just feel like...  You know, as men, we've been down this road before, so...  But Go-Go, don't hold back.  If you're feeling like it's going to chub up, let it go.  Oh, I am.  I'm trying...  I'm really concentrating right now, just to...  Is there something else that you'd enjoy them to do while they're doing this? 
[04:00:00]  Well, normally I like a couple fingers up my ass, but...  Well, can they...  They can't go inside, but would you like them to play around the hole a little bit?  Yeah, totally.  Okay, cool.  You guys lived up.  I'm being told we can't do that.  I'm being told...  Open wide.  Who's talking to you, Goblin?  This is like a deleted scene.  Brad.  The audience?  Yeah, the audience.  This is so gay.  Make it hot, like you're sucking the cock and you mean it.  Yeah. 
[04:00:30]  This is like a deleted scene from Requiem for a Dream or something.  Now they're blowing the dill though.  Lon is not happy with the stroking.  Lon, what's up?  There's nothing hot about it.  They're squeezing the life out of his cock.  I would think they'd know how to jerk themselves off.  You would think.  You guys are putting heart and soul into this.  You're getting tapped out.  What happened?  Exactly.  What?  Get that dill in your mouth.  I'm not going to suck this dick by myself.  Come on.  You are the worst two homos ever.  I got an idea to declare a winner.  Oh, huh?  Freestyle.  What if we just do the first guy to make Gogo completely hard? 
[04:01:00]  Holy shit.  Gogo is a professional.  Hold on.  I think.  Wow.  No, no, no.  You're honest, I'm not.  I think it's a freestyle.  Freestyle.  A two minute freestyle and then Gogo picks.  Yeah.  And if one of them can make him hard, obviously.  Right.  And then Gogo picks who's the gayest, I guess.  Who is the guy?  Can we do that?  Gogo, are you all right with that?  As long as we stay within the bounds of.  Gogo, are you all right with that?  Whatever.  I'm not going to touch that.  Why not, Sam? 
[04:01:30]  Now you do.  Troy.  Two minute freestyle.  Okay.  Anything they want to do.  Anything goes.  To satisfy Gogo.  It's up to Gogo's.  You know what we're talking about.  Don't worry about it.  No oral.  No oral, no penetration.  Oh, shut up.  All right.  Whatever needs to be done.  Who's going to go first?  All right.  It's two minute freestyle and then Gogo will announce the winner.  I have an idea.  Gogo, for this one, Gogo should bend over.  So they have to be behind him.  And it's a freestyle from the back.  With a reach around?  Yep.  Ask Gogo what he wants. 
[04:02:00]  Gogo, what do you think of that?  Yeah, but looking at a man that way is, that's rough.  Why don't he just lift his legs up?  That's true.  I mean, why would we lose eye contact with Gogo?  We're enjoying our chat.  It's free form.  Jesus.  How am I kidding?  It pulled into this.  It's free form.  It's about Gogo's pleasure.  Gogo should be able to pick whatever position he wants.  Fair enough, Sam.  Good call.  We think that...  Oh, sorry.  Let go of me.  We think that...  We think that...  Is it a two minute or a minute?  What do you think?  90 seconds.  Let's go 90 seconds freestyle.  And Dave goes first. 
[04:02:30]  And you've got to really put your all into it or else you're going to lose.  Right.  And this is for the $1,500 courtesy of IHateStevenSinger.com.  All this will have been for naught.  Yeah.  I feel like I'd like to still sit if that's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll put my legs up though.  Oh, boy.  Let's put some music on.  Because it's freestyle.  Let's make it sexy.  Make it sexy.  I feel like it's just a lap dance.  Now you've got to keep your pants off.  Yeah.  It's a 90 second freestyle.  So whatever...  If they want to lap dance you, if they want to play with your balls, whatever it is.  All right.  You've got to satisfy him. 
[04:03:00]  Yes.  In some way, shape, or form.  All right.  Let me think about this.  You have to impress Gogo.  This is going to be a challenge.  I got to.  Heather, you all right with this?  Yeah.  I just wanted to get that cock hard.  I'm cool.  Wow.  All right.  You ready?  We'll start the clock.  All right.  This is it.  Finally.  What do you like?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is the finals.  Whether or not you're ready, we're starting the clock.  Yeah.  This is for a lot of money.  And when we start?  And we...  Wait, wait, wait.  You know what?  I need full use of this.  Oh, he's taking his pants off.  Yeah, get those pants off.  Absolutely.  Good move. 
[04:03:30]  That's right.  And don't think you're going to satisfy him by shoving your ass in his face.  That ain't going to do it.  No, I realize I've got to work for this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be...  $1,800, buddy.  The burden of proof is on you.  Yeah.  Troy, who do you think is going to win this?  It's a close call.  They're both in it to win it.  Yes.  They really are.  It's going to be close.  Let's see what they got.  All right.  All right.  You ready to start?  Let's do this.  Time starts now.  Give me this thing.  He's just tugging his teeth. 
[04:04:00]  Give me this thing, God damn it.  You're going to make it hot, dude.  He's straddling Go-Go's legs, and he's tugging his dick the way a doctor would.  I've never done this before.  This is the freestyle?  Go-Go, tell him.  This is the best I got.  This is the style.  I'm really...  I was trying to back up his manhood by going, you can tell I've never done this before.  I'm really a kisser.  I am so questioning my career.  No, for real.  Yeah, I am too.  This could be the last shot.  Oh, no!  Oh, he's making out.  He's making outies.  That's too rough, sir.  You're kissing Go-Go too rough. 
[04:04:30]  You're really fucking rough?  You were choking on my earth's planet.  What are you going to do with that?  Go-Go doesn't want that on him.  No, no, sir.  What are you, wrecking everybody's fun?  Oh, man.  You are wasting time.  Jesus, I'm making out.  The kissing is the hardest to watch.  It's the hardest to watch.  It's fucking...  I don't even know what.  I mean, like...  I don't...  30 seconds ago.  60 seconds in.  Clock's running, buddy. 
[04:05:00]  What are you doing?  Pull out all the stops here.  I know.  God almighty.  What do you want me to fucking do here?  I know.  What do you think, B?  Ask Heather.  Ask your wife.  Ask your wife.  Put your hand under his balls.  Heather, what can you do?  What are you doing?  All right.  You got a dick.  You know it feels good.  10 seconds.  Just 10 seconds.  His wife's trying to coach him.  He's coaching.  She's a good...  Oh, my God.  Pickle the helmet.  Oh, it's just...  That's right.  He's got the piercing.  That's right.  That's time.  That's time.  That's it.  Get your hands off that thing.  Get your sticking paws off him.  Exactly.  Don't try to get an extra second in there. 
[04:05:30]  All right, Sal.  Sal's next?  Sal's next?  He said it got smaller, disappointedly.  Oh, man.  It did a little bit.  I'm sorry.  Troy, talk to Go-Go.  I know you're coming from a good place.  I tried, man.  I tried to make it happy for you.  He's smaller.  Yeah, because he's not trying to...  I don't think he got much pleasure out of that.  Well...  It's that guy's turn.  Is that your husband?  Oh, that's him back then.  Oh, that's him back then.  Okay.  He's been tapped out.  Is the economy this bad?  I know, right?  Yeah, I'm totally up for Abercrombie. 
[04:06:00]  Right?  Is the economy this bad?  I don't get the sense I like.  You kind of have a feeling for him, right?  I can't even wrap my head around how...  You have a thing for him?  People would just...  I would say...  No, I would say...  I mean, I was really drunk, and it was 3 a.m., and there was no one left in the bar.  In some way, shape, or form.  I mean, you're a handsome man, though.  He won't even look me in the eyes, but...  I think he should while you're kissing.  A little eye contact is what makes a kiss special.  What's going on, Sam?  There's glitter on that guy's mouth.  What is your happy place like?  Are you just thinking of a field of pussies right now, or...?  No, I'm just trying to be completely blank. 
[04:06:30]  Well, get to that happy place...  Like Zen.  Because you're about to have 90 seconds on the clock to bring Gogo to his happy style.  So start the 6.  Start the 6 up there.  And...  Go.  Go.  Yeah, she's right.  Gogo has a full reset.  Hello.  That's better.  How are you?  Good.  Oh, my God.  This is creepy.  Whoa!  He's staring him out in the eye.  He's really jerking him.  Yeah.  He's manipulating the back, as well.  He's playing with his...  I'm trying to grab his ass.  He's grabbing his ass, and he's...  I'm not going to put a finger in.  No, I don't put a finger in.  He's tugging his penis. 
[04:07:00]  Just keep it a secret.  Playing with his balls.  Giving the balls a jiggle.  He's making eye contact.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole time.  He wanted me to make eye contact.  He likes the kiss, too.  Remember that?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, what are you, fucking not caring about him?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  This is the worst kiss ever.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  He's not enjoying the kiss.  I'm sorry.  I'm not trying to go all out.  Well, you got to go all out.  There's a lot of money to stick.  Otherwise, you're just tugging the guy's pot for no reason.  You're digging balls, aren't you?  It's for the $1,500, courtesy of I hate Stevenson. 
[04:07:30]  It is cock to cocks.  Oh, that's right.  Their cocks are touching.  As they should be.  Yeah.  That's the way it should be.  A couple of men's cocks should be touching.  So you know what this guy should do to totally turn around?  If he just went, all right, put some lube in my ass crack and then just rode his dick.  There you go.  But without, you know, shoving it up your ass, but just kind of manipulating it with your  ass crack.  You speak for the people.  You got 20 seconds.  I'm just trying to say what we would have won.  20 seconds to win this.  I might have won it.  Because this is lackluster.  I really, I mean, you know. 
[04:08:00]  You're not even trying.  I don't give up.  I'm not even trying.  He's got 10 seconds left.  Don't be shy.  I've gotten better handjobs from my sister.  Where's the oil?  Where's the oil?  Hold on.  Stop the clock.  No, no.  We're pausing it.  We're pausing it.  It's not.  Time up.  There's 10 seconds.  Yeah, he's still got 15 seconds.  Yeah, he's doing a little idea.  Put 15 seconds back on the clock.  Oh, he's just looming up his ass.  And now he's sitting.  Wow.  I don't know where your ass has been.  That's the other thing.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, he's straight. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Sure he is.  All right.  That's it.  That's it.  There it is.  There's the contest.  Wow.  Well, is there anything else in the contest?  That ended with a whimper.  I know.  Jim, honestly, we could keep going through the afternoon.  Gogo, what do you think?  Who's the winner?  I am.  Let's say this about Gogo first.  Or is there anything else going on?  We might have something else going on.  We got to plug.  He's at GoGoHarder on Twitter and GoGoHarder.com.  You can check out Gogo performing Boy Burlesque at the Robin Bird Show this Saturday. 
[04:09:00]  Robin Bird's still around?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Robin Bird does this really big kind of burlesque show now, so it's not as stripper-y, hardcore.  I'm also not a porn star, just so we're all clear, but I do like sex.  Were you the contortionist dude that was at her show two weeks ago?  No, no.  That was a toy for Bruce Gay.  But yeah, anyway, she does this great show.  There's lots of really beautiful girls.  I know, right?  I'm sorry.  It's just a form of a habit.  That's okay.  But yeah, so I'm there every other Saturday, and you can check it out. 
[04:09:30]  Tickets are at TheCuttingRoom.com.  Yeah.  And GoGoHarder.com or GoGoHarder on Twitter.  How old is Robin Bird?  I'm in shock.  I don't know.  I do not know.  She goes way back.  But you're definitely a trooper.  Definitely a professional.  He came right in and just took the reins.  He's hilarious, too.  Yeah, very funny.  Very funny.  What do you do, do you think, to wrap this contest up?  This is GoGo's decision, right?  I would say so.  Unless you want to see something else, I guess.  Is there anything else that would help?  We've got about ten minutes.  With your decision.  Really?  Yeah.  How about this?  We've got a lot of live reads.  Is it possible, now these guys have done some kissing, for both guys to kneel, and for 
[04:10:00]  GoGo to stand over them and slap them on their closed mouth with his cock?  Of course it's possible.  Anything's possible.  That's fair.  Yeah, that's fair.  Okay, let's try that.  Let's see if anybody can handle that.  I don't think Anthony can handle that.  I know.  I think Anthony's fighting a lot of feelings.  It's okay.  He won't even let me touch him.  He won't really screw with that.  I never like you touching me.  And I don't mind any of this. 
[04:10:30]  It's just weird.  The show has gone way over.  Yeah.  After 18 and what?  Half years, you shut us down.  We don't even know what to say.  This wasn't my contest, though.  Jim, here.  This wasn't my contest.  Here, Jim, have the show.  It's yours.  This was Sam's idea.  I'm just trying to fucking help out.  You owned it, my friend.  You owned it.  Yeah, smack him in the mouth.  We get dick.  Lon, what do you think?  Lon's been very vocal.  Let's get with the wives for a second.  It has to do with GoGo, ultimately. 
[04:11:00]  What do you...  The wives.  What can the wives do for you?  No, no, no, no.  No?  No?  No.  The wives can't make it for you.  Thanks.  I don't want to say it.  The husbands haven't done anything, but I'm sure the wives won't really be able to do  much either.  What a trooper GoGo is, though.  I mean, I'm sorry.  Lon, what a fucking professional.  I just want to boil it down to the fact that he's cuter than I am.  Nothing on that, huh?  You bombed with your clothes off. 
[04:11:30]  You bombed your dick out.  You bombed packing a quarter inch.  I said it.  All right, so I...  All right, why don't you guys kneel down in front of GoGo.  Let's get the show on the road.  GoGo, what do you think?  Let's wrap it up with some good laughs.  You did great, but anything else you think, or are you good?  Well, I mean, I kind of feel like...  You feel like we need one more thing, right?  Yeah, I guess I just don't...  I'm trying to tap into, like, you know, the fears of a heterosexual man, and I just don't...  Like, is it the dick or the hole that's more intimidating? 
[04:12:00]  I don't know.  Maybe resting your penis on their lower back.  The problem is...  Troy, what do you got?  These guys are willing to go as far as we can go.  They kind of are.  Like, unless it's, like, bent over and you're going to get fucked in your ass now.  These guys are...  Two guys dropped out, though.  I already told you I get paid more for that, so...  Two guys dropped out.  Uh, I say some smack in the dick on the mouth, and then, uh, we'll see after that.  We may have one more after that, but I say we see if they can handle that.  Okay.  I say we see if they can.  Maybe, like, a full, just kind of, like, massage with the penis. 
[04:12:30]  There you go!  What the heck?  But you massaging your penis into our faces.  Not the mouth.  Not in the mouth.  Just, uh, you know...  Because that wouldn't be fine.  Just so we're all clear.  As long as the mouth is closed.  I'm going to try, man.  They're going to take this.  No problem.  And don't go fake yawning, you.  All right.  Oh, Jim.  Ruined my fun.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's do this.  Okay.  What are we doing here?  Who wants to go first?  Okay.  You want to get down on your knees?  Stupid underpants and around his ankles.  Troy, what's the time on this one? 
[04:13:00]  You're good with the time.  Do I want to do 90 or 60 on this one?  Jesus.  60.  60.  90 or 60?  We've got eight minutes.  We have 60 seconds?  Yeah.  I think they should have to keep their eyes open.  I agree.  We can't see.  Ant, can you see?  I turn around in this.  You ever rub a pencil eraser on your face?  Yeah, talk us through this, dude.  Yeah, that's what it is.  A pencil eraser.  Troy, what's going on?  Keep telling yourself that. 
[04:13:30]  We got to turn it off.  He's taking his penis head, and he's just wiggling it all over his face.  Oh, it's his dick.  I'm used to there being a camera between me and a penis, usually.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I think making out with the massaging was worse. 
[04:14:00]  Do you suck nicks?  Really?  Than this, yeah.  Do you suck nicks?  I kind of think that's it.  I think we climaxed.  All right, we got one more to do.  We have to do both fair, and then we're done.  Fair is fair, and then we're done.  Maybe.  Turn about a fair play, right?  I'll say it is.  He's in his happy place.  Yeah.  I'm going to look you in the eye.  Go ahead.  Will you?  Okay.  Okay.  I'm kind of, I'm a little nervous that one of them might just go crazy and, like, bite  it off or something.  Like, they just can't handle it anymore.  Put your head down a little bit.  Put your head down.  Oh, my God. 
[04:14:30]  No, well, you can't.  The most important thing.  Not that eye.  He's just tapping his dick and balls all over the guy's face, and the guy is not batting  an eye.  It was like SOS.  It's like you're trying to bully him into fighting by poking him.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, there we go.  That's it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That was, um...  These guys have a stronger constitution than we thought.  Yeah, I guess so.  So what do we do? 
[04:15:00]  Who does Go-Go declare the winner?  Well, we'd have...  Go-Go could declare a winner, I would gather, right?  Yeah.  But does the other guy get nothing?  No, no, no.  We have first, second, and third place.  Oh, okay.  So who's in third already?  Third is Adam.  So Adam won $200.  Adam gets $200.  What is second place?  Second place is $500.  Oh, all right.  $300.  $300.  Sorry.  Sorry to get your hopes up.  $300.  Okay.  First place, $1,500.  Okay.  All right.  So...  And then he's in Greece.  Oh, I'm going to read this right now.  This morning of enchantment has been sponsored by Steven Singer Jewelers. 
[04:15:30]  You get your sweetheart the perfect gift for Valentine's Day, as these guys just did.  They gave their wives memories.  A real long stem rose dipped in 24-carat pure gold.  Visit IHateStevenSinger.com today.  Steven sponsored this, and, you know, obviously the greatest friend we have on the show, so  thanks.  It's wrong with him.  I...  Believe me.  I'm unbelievable.  Okay.  So what do you think?  Jesus.  Yeah, I mean, I know it's a tough choice. 
[04:16:00]  Your input is important.  Out of the two, who do you think was a little more apt to satisfy you than the other?  Okay.  Who wanted it more?  Here's what I think.  Honest to God.  I feel...  And what are you guys' names again?  Dave and John.  Okay.  So John, I feel like you're a handsome man, and I really like the cologne that you wear.  Um, Dave, I feel like you, you know, you really are a people pleaser, and you're just  out there to, um, I mean, if you're not, you know, that adapted, and the kissing could 
[04:16:30]  use a little, uh, a little improvement.  You, you really do try.  Um, I'm gonna have to say, I think, Dave, I'd say you're the winner, and John, you're  the winner.  Wow!  John's not happy.  John?  Dick to my asshole.  Huh?  What'd he say?  Well, he did have his dick, uh, to his asshole.  He whimpered, I touched his dick to my asshole.  Yeah.  He whimpered.  For $300.  He whimpered.  But there wasn't a lot of love in it, though.  You gotta admit that.  That is $300.  I did get him half hard when I was talking to you. 
[04:17:00]  He declared the winner.  I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and that's today's look at the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony Show.
