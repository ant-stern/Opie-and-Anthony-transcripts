<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a vulgar and sexually explicit introduction, featuring Opie and Anthony alongside Jimmy "Tranny" and E-Rock in studio.  The show then transitioned to a discussion about the Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Riggs "Battle of the Sexes" tennis match, speculating about potential Mafia involvement and delving into King's sexuality and societal views on homosexuality.  E-Rock's revelation of food poisoning led to a lengthy segment on unsanitary conditions and questionable ingredients in Chinese restaurants, with callers sharing anecdotes about finding foreign objects in their food and discussing the alleged use of substandard meat. One caller recounted a restaurant with a blood trail leading to the back door.

The show shifted to a discussion about dog breeds, focusing on intimidating breeds and personal experiences with dog bites. Pit Bulls, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Mastiffs, and Presa Canarios were specifically discussed, alongside a caller's use of a Cane Corso for boar hunting.  This transitioned into a caller's cat claw-clipping experience and then to a phone interview with Bill Donahue from the Catholic League about Pope Francis's views on homosexuality and the Catholic Church's handling of the pedophilia scandal.  The hosts challenged Donahue's comments.  Further listener anecdotes included a Fox and Friends fitness challenge, a video of a texting school bus driver, complaints about iOS 7, promotion of the podcast and Jimmy's stand-up shows, and a listener-submitted song about the departure of co-worker Gary.  Upcoming guests Pete Correale and Stalker Patty were mentioned.

A substantial segment focused on Grand Theft Auto V, featuring graphic descriptions of violent acts within the game, including a mission targeting a Zuckerberg/Jobs-like character and frequent use of racial slurs. The discussion then moved to a news story about a mentally challenged man assaulted after his GTA V copy was stolen, with further offensive commentary from the hosts.  A feud with another radio show was discussed, including an account of sending a co-host to silently stare at their rival's studio. A call with Stalker Patty followed, discussing her thyroid surgery, interspersed with more GTA V talk and the ongoing radio show conflict.  The segment ended with brief mentions of upcoming concerts and the 3D re-release of The Wizard of Oz.

A lengthy segment was dedicated to Stalker Patty.  The hosts joked about her unchanging appearance, then discussed her health issues (thyroid lump, hoarseness), a past radio bit with Fez, and her foster brother's alleged inappropriate behavior towards her.  Her job at Starbucks and her upcoming transfer were also discussed, along with sexually suggestive and crude jokes.  The hosts pressed her about her dating life and sexual activity using vulgar language, focusing on a trip to Atlantic City with a friend.  They discussed her illegal podcast access, gave her an XM radio, and engaged in a prolonged, explicit attempt to get her to twerk on air, with considerable focus on her body and clothing.  Colin Quinn called in briefly.

The show concluded with Opie promoting his and Dice's Beacon Theater show and a discussion of the "Stalker Patty Twerking" YouTube video.  Callers debated the video's quality and disturbing nature, with discussions of Patty's attire and movements and the hostsâ€™ follower count.  The identity of someone leaking SiriusXM information to Anthony was also discussed. Sam Roberts denied involvement.  Stalker Patty's long history with the show and her devotion were highlighted.  Kenichi Ebina, America's Got Talent winner, appeared as a guest, discussing his experience, creative process, future plans, and his reaction to the "Stalker Patty" video.  The segment promoted Ebina's tour and social media.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy!  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane. I mean, I mean, this is insane.  So flasherent. 
[00:00:30]  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  Point simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we are.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Another four hours is long.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Check!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Check it!  I'm up early in the morning.  You on it.  Put O.B. and Anthony.  Yeah!  Jimmy Tranny pointing.  O.B. like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up!  There are horrible people to say in this show.  I'll get you all you mean.  And I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene.  But I'll give it a go.  If he sent Larry King. 
[00:01:30]  O.B. and Anthony Show.  Go!  Go!  I know you're feeling the flow.  But O.B.'s motherfucking.  Jimmy's trying to get blown.  Don't come to play around.  And we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is your board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah!  On the edge of your chair.  Cause you really want to hear O.B., Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Yeah!  The O.B. Anthony Show.  Yeah!  Check out this the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah!  It's the O.B. Anthony Show.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  50!  Yeah!  Now I'm typing up in this bit.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Booga booga!  Booga booga!  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Ooh!  Love it!  I still love that intro.  It's the Friday intro, you know.  It is.  We don't want to burn it out.  Friday.  Yep.  It's not every day you get Larry King, 50 Cent, and Mike Tyson singing a little song about 
[00:02:30]  your radio show.  Oh man!  With all inside jokes.  Right.  Yeah!  Larry doesn't even know.  Larry doesn't know he's doing an inside joke on himself.  Right.  How important is the board?  It's like, that's from your how important.  And where are the...  What happened to the groceries?  Right.  There it is.  Billie Jean King's win over Bobby Riggs, rigged by mafia.  Oh.  This happened, I think, while we were on break.  The reason I'm mentioning this is that it was 40 years ago today that Billie Jean King defeated 
[00:03:00]  Bobby Riggs at the big Houston Astrodome.  Wow.  I remember that.  It was a huge...  Battle of the Sexes, right?  That's what it was.  Was it on ABC, Wide World of Sports?  Very big.  They would call Bobby Riggs a male chauvinist pig.  Right.  Oh, you're best messer with his pig.  Mafia?  Do we have a clip of this?  He was a bad tennis player.  He was involved in drugs.  We got people in the Tennis Weekly papers, don't we? 
[00:03:30]  Rigged by the mafia.  Was Billie Jean King the first person to come out of the closet?  She probably should have been the first person to come out of the closet.  I think people were like Liberace about her.  Like, they're like, oh, why doesn't she have a husband?  Oh my God, are you kidding me?  She seems like such a nice lady.  Yeah, back then, people were very...  Are you kidding me?  God bless you.  Now the second you see some guy that maybe practices a little grooming, you're like,  oh, that guy's so gay.  Back then, though, women and men could just blatantly show how gay they were, and people 
[00:04:00]  would be like, oh, where's the husband?  Oh, come on.  But you've got to think that people knew.  Yeah, but there's that underground kind of talk.  But most people didn't even think about gay.  It was Howard Cosell.  Howard Cosell.  Battle of the Sexes.  It was September 20th, 19th.  Is this the whole...  What is this thing, Sam?  Is this a little overview?  This is like a minute-long video explaining why it might be fixed. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, nice!  Well, that's perfectly packaged for our show!  Let's sit back and enjoy.  We don't have to do anything.  I don't have to do any of that reading.  Why is E-Rock rubbing his eyes already?  E-Rock, you all right?  Oh, no.  Late night?  What do you got?  What do you got going?  No, I'm not feeling good.  Oh, no!  You made it five days.  Oh, E-Rock.  What happened?  What happened?  I knew it when I said, hey, E to the R, and he's like, what's up?  I was like thinking he didn't sound well.  You don't feel good in a way where we're all going to be sick by Monday, or what? 
[00:05:00]  No, I think I got food poisoning.  Oh, God.  Why do you do this?  All right, fuck Bobby Reilly.  Well, now the big question, of course, we have to ask.  What did you eat that might have gave you food poisoning? 
[00:05:30]  And how do you know you might have food poisoning?  Are you shitting that out your ass in such a way that makes you think, oh, fuck, I ate something?  Yeah, that.  I'm running a fever, and my stomach is killing me.  Well, running a fever might not be food poisoning.  That might mean something we all might get.  You don't get a fever from food poisoning.  Maybe you got a virus.  Goddamn, get some of that danty shit.  What did you eat?  I had Chinese food.  Did you obviously order it out, or did you go out? 
[00:06:00]  No, I had it delivered.  Now, did the lovely Mrs. Nagel have any?  She had sushi.  Oh, what did you have?  I got Chinese food from a sushi place.  What was it?  What did you get?  General Tso's chicken.  Now, when you think of that right now, does it sound delicious to you?  No, it makes me nauseous.  You wouldn't want to eat a nice big smell, a nice big plate of General Tso's chicken?  No, not in the least.  How about a nice greasy pork chop served in a dirty ashtray? 
[00:06:30]  How much did you eat?  Chinese food.  That's a good question.  Chinese food scares me.  It's frightening.  It really scares me.  It's always a little different depending on where you go, which is kind of creepy.  Well, especially if you go to a sushi joint, so the Chinese food, let me tell you what  happened, Iraq.  Sam's a dick.  Oh, my God.  Sam's a dick.  That's what you ate?  He put a giant picture of General Tso's chicken on the monitor and turned it right toward  Iraq.  There's some nice broccoli in there, too. 
[00:07:00]  The sauce is, I mean, it's, you know, it looks like baby-covered mice.  Oh, wait a minute.  Like a whole plate of mice.  Baby mice, like covered in brown sauce.  Covered in brown sauce.  Like, almost like they needed a couple more weeks in the mama's belly before they were  born.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Iraq.  That's terrible.  Is that bothering you?  It's not helping.  No.  So, I think your mistake, I have no idea, obviously, but sushi food. 
[00:07:30]  Sushi.  Getting the Chinese food out of sushi joints scares me because the Chinese food stays around  just a little longer.  Just a little bit.  Good answer.  And they also don't, most Chinese places will say, you know, you'll have your chicken with  white meat only or, you know, how they regularly make it.  This place didn't have the white meat only option.  It was just General Tso's chicken.  General Tso's chicken.  Dark, dark, really dark meat. 
[00:08:00]  It's like all fatty.  Greasy, yeah.  It's gristly meat.  It's disgusting.  No, you are horrible.  Dark meat at a Chinese restaurant is terrible.  I only go to reputable Chinese restaurants.  I've got a couple places I order from, and they're great, but if, like, one of the places  are closed or something, you get that other menu that was shoved in your mailbox, they're  too shady.  I won't do that.  You've got to make sure they're moving through the food quickly, especially Chinese food.  That's why you need a really good place that's busy.  And maybe ate deer or something last night.  Oh.  Maybe some Chinese dude was dragging the deer in the back. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, yeah, like that other story with the trail of blood going into the back door.  Through the entire restaurant.  No, no, that one got lazy and dragged a deer carcass through the restaurant itself.  Nodding at the customers, hello.  And you know what?  I don't give a fuck.  I've told this story ten times.  I'll do it again.  I've been scared of Chinese food since the Northport days out there on Long Island, and  the place is now closed, so I'm not worried at all.  But I ate at this Chinese restaurant in Northport on Main Street, and as I took my first and 
[00:09:00]  pretty much only bite, I realized that I was not eating chicken.  You just knew it, right?  And it was foreign to me.  Oh, boy.  It was foreign.  Was that when you were at your summer house in Northport?  Yep, my summer house where we put this whole fucking thing together many, many years ago.  My summer house.  The summer home.  Had to be.  The shitty top half of my house. 
[00:09:30]  But I knew I was eating something I never ate before.  Yeah, huh?  I have no idea what it was, but I have no doubt in my mind it was not chicken.  It wasn't chicken.  No, man.  It was bad news.  Did you get any dark meat?  Yeah, there was one piece that seemed a little grizzly.  What?  And that's when I stopped.  I said, this is not tasting right.  Wow, and now you're all fucking sick.  Yeah.  Jeez Louise.  That greasy fucking dark.  It's like gray meat.  It's not good. 
[00:10:00]  You can't bite through it.  Yeah, I know.  It's gray.  But where do they get that meat from?  It's like the back fat of the chicken.  It's the lowest part of the fucking chicken.  Cartilage.  Is it the legs?  Of the lowest chicken, too.  It's not even the legs.  It's like thigh.  It's no, it's um.  Where is it?  The skin over the toes.  It's the thigh, right?  I think it's thigh meat.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Because even the legs you'll get a, you know, some nice white meat on.  If you look at like chickens that Chinese restaurants get, like non-reputable ones, they're  probably the shittiest looking fucking.  It's different chicken.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  At some of these places?  You go into the grocery store and you like get the name brand chicken.  It looks good.  And then even if you, at the grocery store, you go down the shelves a little and you see  like the discounty ones and they're a little skinnier.  They got some like feathers still sticking out of them.  They just start looking sadder and sadder.  Yes, as you go on.  And those are probably still even top of the line depending on what the, compared to what  the Chinese places get.  It has to be some offshoot of chicken or something.  Does anyone know this?  Like they go to a chicken farm and get the fucking like the runts of the litter and the 
[00:11:00]  shitty ones.  The ones that die of cancer.  Because they don't have, they don't have Purdue.  No, you know they're not serving you Purdue.  So what kind of chicken is it in the Chinese restaurants?  That's one of the questions today.  Because it absolutely is different.  You're right.  Oh, it's crap.  Is it Cornish hens?  A Cornish game hen.  Is it a Cornish game hen?  It's probably really cheap meat that they buy.  It's just squab.  I think it's squab.  But what makes chicken cheap? 
[00:11:30]  In bulk they buy that.  To me, I just assumed all chicken was the same.  They probably buy the scraps that the other stores won't serve.  Yes.  Like they probably pick up, I bet you that the chicken they get is in giant plastic, like  almost like a medical bag of chicken parts.  And they probably serve like the hearts, the fucking lungs, all that stuff.  Oh, man.  It's probably put in, like, whatever makes a hot dog a hot dog is probably what makes  Chinese food chicken.  It's probably that pink chicken goo that they make McNuggets out of.  Oh, yeah.  Have you seen those videos? 
[00:12:00]  Huh?  That slurry they make.  The pink chicken goo.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's called, like, something meat.  Yeah.  That's probably what they use in a Chinese restaurant.  That's fucking disgusting.  Couldn't bite through grisly chicken since he stopped, Kirok?  I'm sure it's only fucking chicken parts.  Like, they don't get a full chicken with a big chicken breast and fucking...  It's, like, just the shittiest limbs cut off, and that's why they cover it with sauce.  Exactly.  They got to work that shit in that wok before you could even fucking look at it. 
[00:12:30]  So we don't know.  I don't know.  I'm looking on my Twitter here.  So far, no answer to the question, to today's question.  Because the chicken absolutely is different.  Did he go to bed hungry, Kirok?  Uh-oh.  No, I did not.  Why, did you eat a lot before you got to the bad chicken?  No.  How much did you eat before you got to the bad chicken?  That's a fair question.  About half.  All right, so that's a lot.  Yeah.  I mean, that's not an obese portion, but... 
[00:13:00]  It took you a while to realize the chicken was bad.  I was hoping it was going to turn around.  Were you hoping it was going to turn around?  Yeah, yeah.  It was just a piece.  I'm good.  Any fried rice?  Ooh.  I like the fried rice.  Yeah, it comes within the little white container.  You've got to have wonton soup.  My sister-in-law is Chinese.  You know what?  We're going to Jay.  Really, Opie?  Oh.  Oh, I thought you were talking.  My sister-in-law...  Okay, listen to this. 
[00:13:30]  I've been suspicious of this for a while.  Jay in Jersey, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, so my sister-in-law is Chinese.  We went over to China to meet her family.  And they actually served pigeons at the table.  I mean, they weren't trying to hide anything.  Oh, boy.  It was pigeons.  So I know that's something that they absolutely eat.  I don't know.  I'd be a little suspicious, man, that they're serving that. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, that.  And the beef never looks like fucking beef.  And once I was eating some beef and broccoli, and I swear, the fragrance reminded me of when  I used to wash my horse.  And, like, the horse would get wet.  Oh, my God.  And I'd be, like, cleaning it.  But the smell of, like, wet horse, that's what it smelled like.  And I was like, oh, my God, how would you even know?  No one's checking this shit.  Well, that's why they cover it up with all this goodness.  Yeah, all that saucy goodness.  All that saucy, sugary... 
[00:14:30]  Did you really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  If I'm going to fuck them, I might as well eat them.  Let's see.  Let's see.  How to John in Michigan.  John.  Hey, I've delivered into a place before, a Chinese place, and the chicken you're talking  about was soaking in big 55-gallon drums and, like, a bleach water.  It's leg meat and thighs and just the crap meat, but if you notice, it's always white.  They bleach it. 
[00:15:00]  I'm telling you, there's something going on.  You can't order Chinese food unless you know the place.  Like, if you go to a good Chinese restaurant, you can't order from one of those places that  has fucking bulletproof glass in it.  No, God, no.  It's got to be a place that you know locally, you've been to, maybe you've eaten there in  the restaurant before, and they're busy.  You know, and then you, like, there's a place right by me that I've gone to and actually  sat down there and had dinner, and it's great.  And I only order Chinese food from them.  Right.  But, like you said, yeah, you don't know what the fuck you're getting. 
[00:15:30]  Or you go with rice.  You go with some kind of rice if you're going to order from a place you don't.  Because they really can't fuck up fried rice that way.  Unless they use the maggots.  Atta boy.  Just maggots in the place of rice.  I feel like something's going on, because the Chinese, they really know how to cut a  corner or two.  Oh, they do.  They're going to cut a corner or two.  With a smile.  Right.  If they can get away with it, they're going to cut a corner.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, the great and very missed Patrice O'Neal would give us his Chinese food 
[00:16:00]  stories over the years.  He didn't care for Chinese food customer service.  No.  Oh, my God.  They are the fucking worst.  Yeah.  That place near my house, I went there with a couple of friends.  The guy kept fucking telling me, like, five minutes.  Five minutes.  What does that mean?  Like, for a table.  Oh, oh, oh.  And I'm waiting, and people are fucking coming in.  They're getting seats.  I'm fucking sitting there going, what the fuck?  Well, were they like this?  They were.  That's why.  The chick I was with actually brought up the fact that we should go up and try to bribe 
[00:16:30]  the guy, give him a 20.  He fucking took the 20, put it on there and goes, thank you, thank you, very good specials  tonight, and didn't give us a fucking table.  You got to tape your eyes back.  Didn't give us a fucking table.  I've told you that some of these places that they will serve their own before round eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's their way of basically being polite to you, but telling you also that you're not  welcome there.  Yeah.  Is that what it was?  I don't know.  Or was the guy just a shitty maitre d'oeil?  Like, maybe he was...  No, he was very fit.  And then people he knew would come in, and he would give them a fucking table and be 
[00:17:00]  like, oh, no, he always here.  But the people he knew, were they...  No, no.  There was one guy who was a Jewish guy, like some part of the avenue.  Yeah, yeah.  How long did you wait?  We actually, we wound up leaving.  We were trying to catch a movie.  I guess they were playing Plan 9 from Out of Space somewhere, so I wanted to check that  out.  But, yeah, fucking unbelievable.  They wanted you to leave. 
[00:17:30]  That's why I just ordered from the place.  Yeah.  Although they changed the boundaries of where they stop ordering.  So now I'm right on the other side of the street, so I have to actually tell the guy  I'm from the other side of the street and stand in front of the house across the street  to get food.  You're kidding.  No.  Why would you do that?  Because they make some of the best shit.  How the fuck do they know it's your house?  Well, they don't.  I'd stand there and wait for the car to pull, but make it seem like I'm at that house.  Just to get Chinese food. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, because the guy said, I go, why can't it's right across the street when I first  got into a little argument with him?  Right.  And he goes, no, we serve your street, then we got to do the next one, and the next one,  and the next one.  Where do we come home?  They did that because the city cracked down on the bikes they used.  Yes, yes.  Did he ever refuse to serve you?  Yeah.  Yeah, he found out, actually, that I wasn't at that house.  You're kidding.  I had it in my hand.  He ripped the fucking food out of my hand and took off.  What?  Oh, my God, you got me today, too.  No, he got me on the first line, and then I recognized it.  Fuck, you got me today. 
[00:18:30]  Fuck!  This is the first time I've been caught by a Seinfeld.  This is the first time I haven't.  Really?  Yeah, one line in.  Oh, fuck.  I literally just recently fucking was on, and I watched a minute of it.  Oh, damn it.  I'm like, oh, then the guy wouldn't serve us.  I thought I was getting Jimmy.  No.  Oh, I hate it.  Wait, wait, that one, or did I at least get you with the maitre d' that wouldn't fucking  seat me?  Oh, God, yeah.  That was a total no episode.  Oh, you got me.  That was like two episodes.  You got me twice. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, you got me a hook, line, and sinker.  Fuck.  Hook, line, and sinker with that one.  I forgot that.  Oh, no.  I was ready to firebomb the place.  That one's Seinfeld 4th?  Yeah, the famous Seinfeld 4th.  Oh, that one, you got me one.  But when you said I lied, they wouldn't serve to the side of the street.  I believed it, and then one line, and I'm like, oh, yeah, I saw that one.  Fuck.  Good job.  All right, so you did get me.  All right.  All right.  My 11 o'clock's are ruined, by the way, at night, putting that stupid Arsenio on.  Oh, God damn it. 
[00:19:30]  Are you still watching Arsenio?  There's no real buzz on it.  No.  I watched the first episode.  It came out, and the ratings were incredible for the first episode.  For the first episode?  They said the ratings were really good.  Huh.  But no one's talking about the Arsenio's talk show, right?  It's probably because everybody thought Seinfeld was on.  Well, what channel's he on, even?  It's WPIX in New York.  Yeah, New York.  He's syndicated.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, I just wasn't feeling it.  It seemed like, oh, boy.  Because he was kind of hip and stuff back then, you know?  But now he's just not in that age bracket. 
[00:20:00]  All right, we got some great phone calls about Chinese chicken and where it comes from.  Jason in Rochester.  How's it going, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  The home of Brother Wheeze.  What's up, Jason?  When I went to the Culinary Institute, my health safety class, my safety inspection class,  he was a safety inspector.  He went out to eat with one of his health inspector buddies at a Chinese place on the beach.  And he was eating his chicken, his sesame chicken, and he found a BB in the chicken. 
[00:20:30]  So he demanded to see the guy's cooler.  He goes in, there's seagulls hanging up.  And the guy's been going out on a beach with seagulls.  That sounds like an urban legend.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Here's where you lost me when you said he demanded to see the guy's cooler.  Right, right.  Yeah, who wouldn't do it?  And if he knows he's got pigeons hanging up or seagulls hanging up in his cooler, why would  he let the guy in?  You know, this...  No, I don't doubt there's probably someone doing that.  But they're very mysterious, because we're going to take a couple more phone calls, but 
[00:21:00]  no one can really prove it.  See, that's what it is.  That's what is very bothersome here.  It's like an E-Rock text.  Right, exactly.  Very vague.  There's a lot of suspicion, but no one can really nail them on it.  Right.  Because we've heard everything from what?  Cats?  Cat was always a big one.  They love eating their cats.  Pigeons now, seagulls.  Uh-huh.  But no one can really prove it, except for the dude in Buffalo with the deer.  Right, because the guy blatantly dragged a dead, bleeding deer through the front of the 
[00:21:30]  restaurant.  Do you have the news clip of that?  I love that one.  We haven't played it in a while.  Please.  Oh, my health inspector...  Oh, God, you're still on the line.  I forgot about this.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm not punching out, guys.  No, no.  It's all right.  It's all right.  He's all fucking flustered.  It's all right, brother.  Thanks, Jason.  So, wait, Seinfeld, they went to a movie, and that's why they left?  Yeah, yeah, because it was taking so long for them to get seated in the Chinese restaurant,  and they just kept watching other people go in front of them. 
[00:22:00]  So, it's just a lie.  So, they said, fuck it, and they left to go to the movie, and the second they left, that's  when the guy went, Seinfeld, fall, to seat them.  They just missed.  Lawrence in Texas.  Go ahead, Lawrence.  Yeah, I don't know about the bleaching, but the water might have been white, because they  use a baking soda to, like, in their stir-fry and stuff.  That's what changes the color and the taste, and also, like, the tenderness.  What are you, Mr. Chinese Food Cook guy?  Couldn't think about it.  I know they use the baking soda for the stir-fry. 
[00:22:30]  I know they're doing something, because I get those headaches after Chinese Food, and  they always say, it's the MSG.  MSG.  So, then you tell the people, no MSG, and they're like, we don't use MSG.  It must be the baking soda and the bleaches and whatever else they're doing.  Yeah, everything else they're doing.  Or they just say, okay.  Like, literally, you might say, don't put any bowling balls in my food.  Okay.  Okay.  They just ignore it.  It means nothing when you say it.  Well, it's high salt, to begin with.  Very.  The Oafster can't handle high salt.  A lot of salt.  Is this the story out of Buffalo? 
[00:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We haven't done this.  I saw he went.  Chinese Food, ever again.  One channel.  How do we fix the one channel thing?  That's a video.  That's not us.  I really wait for him.  Can I do it on the board or something?  Click a mono.  Make it mono.  Some former customers of Red Flower Chinese Restaurant are angry about what they say happened  while they were enjoying a Chinese buffet.  A lot of locals eat there, like, on lunch breaks and stuff. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, it was really disturbing.  There was actually a blood trail that they were mopping up behind the garbage can.  Katie Hopkins says she witnessed employees dragging in a trash bin with a dead carcass inside of it.  There was, like, a tail and, like, a foot and a leg sticking out of the garbage can,  and they wheeled it straight back into the kitchen.  That's when Environmental Health Inspector Paul Lawson was called to check it out.  Very good special tonight.  And when Paul Lawson showed up to the restaurant, what he found inside, he says, is the craziest thing he's ever seen. 
[00:24:00]  On arrival, I confirmed they did have a deer carcass in the facility.  The discovery led to the health department shutting down the restaurant.  The owner tells Lawson that he picked up the deer along I-75.  They said they didn't know they weren't allowed to do that.  Rogue kill!  So that makes me concerned that maybe they could have before.  The owners also tell Lawson that they planned to take the deer home and didn't plan to serve it to customers. 
[00:24:30]  Sure.  All right.  Paulette's WLKY News.  Damn!  Do you know how many people saw that story and were regulars there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And they're probably eating something that tasted weird ten times.  Just a little off.  And if they're picking up roadkill fucking deer, what's the difference between that and maybe a fucking dog or a goddamn possum?  Something like that.  Oh, we could go good to possum tonight!  Just bleach that shit and make it look like white chicken.  That might have been a possum.  Chicken or beef.  That might have been possum.  Maybe possum.  Like, not a deer, but that might have been a possum that you ate. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  All right.  This guy...  A-Rack doesn't look very good today.  This guy's been the in food...  I've been in food service distribution for 15 years.  Okay.  We might get an answer.  Will in Mississippi, what's up?  We're doing it, brother.  Hey, man.  How are y'all?  We're doing all right, Will.  Hey, Jimmy.  I love you.  Thank you, Will.  As you should.  Real quick, and I just quit my job two days ago, but...  Oh, God love you.  I know.  I spent 15 years doing this shit. 
[00:25:30]  What was your job?  I was in sales and sales management.  Boo.  Homeboat.  But I used to go into a lot of these Asian accounts, and what if you're getting me, and  you're getting what used to be good products on our standards, what they'll do, if you'll  never notice, you'll see those Chinese distributors backed up to their door, they'll go out and  make these big, huge opportunity buys on product that's either fixing to go out of date or 
[00:26:00]  was frozen shortly before it went out of date.  So they'll go out and buy it just cheap as shit, and the Chinese distributors will buy  this, the local ones, then send it out to the individual locations.  Well, if you'll ever look at those trucks, they don't have refrigeration on them.  So what's your taste?  Oh, come on.  I'm serious now.  You've got to have some refrigeration. 
[00:26:30]  Not necessarily.  If you've got an inflated truck...  That's expensive.  Like we said earlier, the Chinese know how to cut some corners.  It'll last, even if it's frozen.  But what you're tasting, most of the time, is freezer burn.  That's why the chicken looks great.  It's just...  Sounds good.  It's cold and frozen so many times that it's freezer burn on the product.  Now, I'll tell you a good little quick story.  When I first started and I was just broke, and I was calling on this guy here in town, 
[00:27:00]  and I went into his account, and every time I'd go in there, he'd go,  Will, you want to, you know, fix you up a free plate?  Fix you up a free plate?  Okay, great, man.  I was broke.  So, you know, I would take this stuff home and eat it later.  One day, I made the bad mistake of going in the back of the kitchen instead of the front  door, and I walk in, and he's got this little silver tray on the floor.  It's maybe 100 degrees outside, Mississippi weather.  His kitchen might have been 150.  And I walk in, and it just hits me, this smell. 
[00:27:30]  And I look down on the floor, and just in a silver tray, no ice, no water,  no all this other crap they're talking about bleeps and stuff is bullshit.  Just raw chicken in a dish on the floor.  And I went, oof.  And I went, oof.  You know what, though?  We got you.  That story was not particularly acclimactic.  No.  But that's the truth.  That's a true story.  You don't have amazing food stories. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  That doesn't sound like some big, grandiose story.  That's just a disgusting Chinese restaurant story.  And the fucking meat, it's out of date.  That's probably what it is, right?  Yeah.  No, no.  It's exactly what it is.  I'm sorry, man.  Yeah, you're right.  I'm sorry for an interesting food.  No, it's very interesting.  No, not bad, actually.  All right.  You loved it, I swear.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, thank you.  I'm trying to put all this together.  So far, we've heard pigeon.  Right.  We've heard deer, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  Shitty chicken that's been frozen and thawed numerous times. 
[00:28:30]  On refrigerated.  Possum, maybe.  Well, we threw the possum there.  Could be.  And now we've got to add another one to the list.  Pam in South Carolina.  Pam.  Good evening.  Pam.  Another story, by the way, you're about to hear where it's mysterious, but...  It's really gross.  Really gross.  I don't eat Chinese food anymore because of this story.  I'm from Long Island originally.  Welcome.  Strong Island.  What town?  I grew up in Oakdale.  Oakdale. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, in Oakdale, girl.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  You ever drink down at the wharf?  Yes, I have.  Yeah, bitches.  Going local.  You have to go the night before things.  Local as kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I've been down the wharf.  I'll be at several bars when I was growing up.  Yeah.  Like, heavy.  Good girl.  Nice.  A very good girl.  How many times have you been?  It's rough down here.  It's rough.  All right.  She's just...  Okay.  All right.  But I'll tell you a story. 
[00:29:30]  Thanks, Pam.  A Brooklyn firefighter...  Not a firefighter who fought a fire in Brooklyn.  It was a Chinese restaurant, and they busted down a wall in the back of the restaurant,  and there were a bunch of cats that had been skinned, and they were draining, and they  were hanging, like, from the scene.  Oh, come on.  So that was it for me.  That guy did it for me.  Put the nail on it.  No more Chinese food.  And this guy swears that's what he saw?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yikes.  It was fantastic.  Man, I want to bust him. 
[00:30:00]  Yep.  So I would...  Let's go bust a Chinese restaurant.  They're clever.  Yeah.  They cover it all up.  Yeah, they do.  All right.  Thank you, Pam.  Crazy.  Love you.  Bye.  Well, we got another...  This one will back up Pam's story.  Chuck in Virginia.  Chuck.  Yeah, boys.  Yeah, when I lived up in Jersey, it was a beautiful Chinese restaurant.  Everybody lined up for it.  And one of my guys went in the back and found a whole bunch of really bitty cat carcasses  in the garbage. 
[00:30:30]  Called the health department and shut them down.  But that was glass I ate in that restaurant for years before I had Chinese.  Apropos.  Yo.  Hi, boys.  Wait.  You got a wild voice there, Chuck.  Yeah.  How old a gentleman are you?  What's that?  How old a gentleman are you?  65.  Okay.  65.  All right.  65 years young. 
[00:31:00]  65.  You got it.  Are you retired?  Yeah.  What did you used to do?  I was in communications.  Oh, that's vague.  That's very vague.  We could say that.  What did you do in communications?  Oh, audio-visual.  Audio-visual communications.  That's still pretty vague.  Still vague.  Yeah, it's every moment of everyone's life.  Yeah.  It's from major corporations.  You still getting your pension? 
[00:31:30]  Is that why you don't want to say anything?  Yeah.  Slow down a lot.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, have fun there.  Yeah, whatever.  You too, guys.  Later.  Thank you, Chuck.  Chuck in Virginia.  All right.  In Virginia.  All right, all right, all right.  Wow, that's pretty fucking disgusting stuff right there.  Oh, this is because Iraq's sick from Chinese food.  Yeah, Iraq is a little ill-fated.  Oh, poor Iraq.  Those calls help you out at all?  No, we don't have a definite answer, and it's just making me more nauseous. 
[00:32:00]  You'll be fine, though.  What time did you eat last night?  About 8 o'clock.  So it's almost 12 hours.  You're still in a little bit of a shit zone, but you're probably okay.  How bad is the shit?  You know if you add water to dog food that doesn't have water added to it?  You're pissing out his ass.  I've never heard it described that way.  Just mushy.  When you have dry dog food that's not supposed to have water added to it, and it just expands 
[00:32:30]  into these big, soft, like...  Yeah, I get it.  Iraq's shit makes its own gravy.  Like Gravy Train.  Oh, my shit.  That's fucking disgusting.  All right.  Damn.  My grandfather used to say when we were eating Chinese food, he'd come in from the Met game  that was on in the living room, you know, and he'd come in and go,  Hey, hey, you're all eating chinks. 
[00:33:00]  Did he really?  Yeah.  That's like...  That's one of probably five things I ever remember my grandfather saying.  He wasn't a wordy guy at all.  Oh, my God.  It was that or...  Uh, Anthony, get your grandpa some more ammunition.  And those were beers.  Oh, okay.  I gotta have to get him another beer.  Grandpa needs some ammunition.  And I'd get him a fucking Schaefer.  Whose father was he? 
[00:33:30]  My mom's dad.  Mommy's dad.  All I remember of him is just him in that fucking lounge chair, that fucking Castro convertible  in the living room of the house that now my aunt and uncle have, and I still go there.  Right.  For holidays and stuff.  And the TV with the antennas, you know, the aerial, and him just watching the Mets and  going, God damn it.  And then bitching that the Yankees, the Yankees, that's a boat team.  A boat team.  Even back then.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was all the same shit. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, it was funny.  He had a dog, a big German shepherd in the backyard named Caesar.  Wow.  And he had a big dog house, and one of the scariest things he could do as a kid was go  into Caesar's dog house.  And, uh, cause he'd like, he was fucking vicious.  He'd be like, go into Caesar's dog house.  No, you go.  And then he'd fucking go in.  And he'd be running around the yard, probably fucking biting black people.  But, uh, you know, we were just fucking, we got lucky.  Did Caesar ever bite you? 
[00:34:30]  Uh, Caesar bit me on the ear once.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That nip, that nip bite?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like a, kind of a quick, and of course, I burst into tears like my head just got blown  off and, uh, started crying.  And I think, um, mom grabbed me and hugged me and my father called me a faggot.  You know, just a normal, normal day.  Tuesday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  German shepherds are my number one.  That's the dog.  You like them, huh?  No, that's the dog I'm scared of the most.  Oh. 
[00:35:00]  You don't see many around anymore unless they're being used for, you know, professional  purposes.  I mean, I got bit on my, uh, paper route, my inner knee, and I, I'm scared of, uh, German  shepherds to this day.  Ooh.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Number one over pit bulls and every other fucking dog.  Oh, look at that thing.  God.  Although the Dobermans are pretty close.  Dobermans.  They used to be the scariest dog in the world years ago.  Doberman pinchers.  Even German shepherds.  And then when, once you came out.  Is there a list of the scariest dogs in the, in the world?  I'm sure.  Because I don't even know if, I mean, there's dogs.  There's dogs that beat the German shepherd. 
[00:35:30]  This is just from personal experience that makes, uh, number one for me.  And then before pit bull, there was what?  Doberman was the big scary one before pit bull.  No, but there was the other one with the big fat head.  Rottweiler?  Roddy.  Yeah.  Roddy's got a bad rap for a while.  They're up there on my list, too.  But pit bulls right now are just the number one hated fucking scary monster dog.  What was the other one that they were police dogs that, uh, George Foreman had?  George Foreman had him?  It looked like he had a, he offended the Africans.  It was not a German shepherd.  It was, uh, the big, the very good police dogs.  Wow, really?  Dobermans would have to be up there, right? 
[00:36:00]  No, they look like German shepherds, though.  They're in the same family.  Oh.  Really?  Uh, somebody will know.  A mastiff?  No, not a mastiff.  A chow?  No, no.  A chow's a nasty.  A dalmatian?  No.  What do you mean chows are nasty?  I used to have a neighbor who had two chows, and those dogs would attack anybody that came  near their house with their big purple tongues.  That must have been quite ironic for you.  Not liking chow.  I tried to, I tried to shoehorn something in there, but. 
[00:36:30]  Ten scariest guard dogs.  Oh.  Okay.  What was that?  Fuck it.  I think there's an A in it.  Oh.  An A?  Yeah.  What do we got?  An An Ask Allum.  What?  I never heard of those dogs.  Uh, what?  No, I think.  Gogo Argentino?  No!  Never heard of it.  He's a great Italian singer.  That's a scary dog?  It's all muscle, dude.  Anatolian Shepherd? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, that might be it.  Yeah.  Anatolian Shepherd?  Anatolian Shepherd?  How big is that?  Damn, that thing looks pretty fucking frightening.  Wow, look at the ears back.  Are they guard dogs?  Yeah.  You ever want to see those ears do that?  Jeez.  Ever.  It's a pretty dog, though.  Yeah, it really is.  What kind is it, Sam?  Gogo Argentino.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a pretty fierce dog.  It's also one of the names that Anthony Wiener was using on the, uh...  I'm Gogo Argentino.  See? 
[00:37:30]  That's 10.  Akita?  Yeah, Akita's 9.  Well, that's the one I think Jimmy's talking about.  I'm trying.  Whatever is Foreman's...  No, uh...  I'll weigh in.  Uh...  I'll know when I hear it.  That dog's scary?  They're giant.  What is that?  Oh, an Akita.  Yeah.  They're adorable.  They are adorable.  I wouldn't be...  Aw, look at that.  That is a puppy.  Come on.  That's when they're puppies.  Aw.  I wouldn't be scared of that.  You would if you saw them.  They're huge.  Coming at you.  Lunging at you.  Well, yeah.  Then, of course, I'd be scared, but... 
[00:38:00]  They are very, um...  Wow.  Very bootiful dog.  There's one that lives in my building.  He's friendly, but if he wasn't friendly, he'd be terrifying.  You could tell, right?  Yeah.  Okay, let's keep going.  I'm going to be confused with you, but it's like, if it wasn't play biting, it'd be horrible.  Fuck, really?  Yeah.  Borbo.  Borbo.  Bobo?  Yeah, stop right there.  Wolf.  Wolf, right?  Stopping my owners in here and I'm protected of a right.  Look at these things. 
[00:38:30]  What the fuck is that?  A borbo.  Tiny Lister.  That's crazy, because it looks like, um...  It looks like, kind of like, um...  A pit bull face head.  It does.  But it's so low to the ground.  That's center of gravity.  You couldn't kick that thing over.  You couldn't fucking shoot him away.  Look at his legs.  Look how stout that thing is.  Fuck that.  That would just fuck you up.  Go back down how big that thing is.  Look at his head.  Look at that dog's head.  That is giant.  That's a biting dog.  It's those fucking...  Yeah, they get the jaw muscles crunched down on you. 
[00:39:00]  That's one of those dogs I've never seen before in my entire life.  I fucking like it.  Look at the size of that head.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  That's a Rocky Dennis dog.  The head is three times the size of a human head.  Are they Mastiffs?  No, that's a Borbo.  That's a Borbo.  Borbo?  It's a South African breed that we've bred.  It's a Borbo.  All right, the next one is Mastiff.  We're looking at the top ten scariest guard dogs.  South African breed.  Yeah, I wonder what they've bred them for.  Oh, boy.  Wait, the Mastiff now, are they long-haired or short-haired? 
[00:39:30]  You're going to find out in a second.  Wow.  I don't want a big, drooly, fucking retarded dog.  They're almost as big as a horse, though.  Look at this.  Yeah, I mean, they're...  Ridiculous.  What is that?  That's not a dog.  Come on.  I swear to God, that's a dog.  You've never seen the Mastiff?  They're huge.  That is a giant fucking dog.  They're one of the biggest dogs in the world.  How big is that Mastiff?  Not that one.  That was actually...  That picture you just showed?  Oh, my God.  That's got to be from a horse perspective.  Come on.  That looks like a huge pig. 
[00:40:00]  They used that in a Chinese zoo to pretend it was a lion, and then people wanted their  money back because the lion died.  They shaved it so it looked like it had a fucking mane.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Holy shit.  Come on.  That woman's standing far back.  Yeah, she's two towns away.  Oh, they're huge dogs.  They are big, though.  Wow, that's nuts.  How much do they weigh?  Jesus.  I don't know.  Any stats on the Mastiff?  Depends, probably. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I mean, there's all different types.  That's cray.  Well, everyone knows they're huge dogs.  All right, back to the list.  What are we looking at next?  Scariest guard dogs.  Rhodesian Ridgeback.  That sounds scary.  Let's see what this thing looks like.  Oh, man.  How is that scary?  Oh, come on.  That's not bad.  Oh, I pet that thing until it's sent.  Oh, that doesn't look scary.  It looks like man's best friend.  Yeah, give him a little chin shuka.  Yeah.  I bet he's fucking got something, though. 
[00:41:00]  Just clicks in his head, and he fucking rips your eyeballs out.  Right.  Crazy dog.  Oh, there you go.  You put a tack after the dog's name, and you get some lovely pictures that pop up.  Oh, my goodness.  What's that one eating a porcupine?  What is that?  What kind of nature scene's going on there?  Holy shit.  The dog is raping a carpet.  All right, let's keep going.  Died Doberman Pinscher.  Doberman.  Oh, the old Doberman.  Yeah, for years they were used.  They were your scary dogs. 
[00:41:30]  Remember boys from Brazil?  With the fucking little Hitler kid that had the Dobermans?  Right.  Number four is German Shepard.  Attacked Gregory Peck.  Four is German Shepard.  All right.  Okay.  Number three.  Cane Corso.  See, another dog I've never heard of before in my life.  What does this thing look like?  That's how you know that they're bad if you've never heard of them, because that means nobody  has them as pets.  Right.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, my God.  That thing is a killing machine.  Get the fuck out of here.  Another one that sort of has a pit bull head.  Killing machine. 
[00:42:00]  Cane Corso dog.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, do that one.  Oh, my God.  Would you...  I don't fuck with that thing.  He looks like Bane.  Wow.  Wow.  How big did he get, though?  Look at him.  Aw.  That's a puppy.  He's very cute.  Aw.  Let me see the lady petting him.  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you think that she would get hassled walking that thing?  No.  That's a fucking nasty looking dog.  I want to get one of each and just throw him in the backyard and see what happens.  Michael Vick? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, well, yeah.  Yeah.  What was he fighting?  Pit bulls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  It's the culture, though.  Uh, Rottweiler is two.  Rottweiler.  Rottweiler.  Well, then you know, number one.  Yeah.  It is the pit bull.  The poodle.  Yep.  The poodle.  Poodle's a fish.  Why is the pit bull scarier than the fucking Mastiff?  Even though the bite is so intense and incredible.  Probably because it's way more aggressive.  Yeah, and the Mastiff is intimidating.  That Mastiff that that guy was walking next to a pony.  How much fun would that be to have one of those dogs? 
[00:43:00]  Can't have it in New York City, obviously, but...  Unless you've got a ten-bedroom apartment to a fucking brownstone.  Oh, God.  Pit bull.  All of the people that try to convince everybody that pit bulls are the sweetest dogs.  But they're not trained, or they probably are nice.  You're pissing off Bill Burr right now, sir.  I know.  But all I'm saying is, just stop.  Just every time you hear about these fucking...  And I know they've been abused and shit, but...  You know.  This dog is coming up a lot on our phones.  Let me say hi to Liam. 
[00:43:30]  Liam, go ahead.  Dog on my phone?  What's up, guys?  Jimmy's thinking of a Malwa.  It looks like a shepherd, but...  Yeah.  You're right.  A Belgian Malwa, right?  Yeah.  It's got like a cropped tail, and the military uses it a lot.  Oh, Belgian Malwa.  Okay.  That's supposed to be good dogs, right?  Protective.  So that's the dog Jimmy was talking about?  I think it is.  Yeah, that sounds...  How do you spell it?  Belgian Malwa.  M-A-L...  W-A.  It's got an X in there, I think.  Somewhere.  Uh, we're trying to find it.  We get it?  I think that's the one...  It looks sort of like a German Shepherd? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Military uses it a lot.  There's supposed to be nasty German Shepherds.  Yeah, that's the one I'm thinking of, right?  That Malwa is the one I'm thinking of.  Oh, fuck.  Look at that.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  Yeah, they're beautiful dogs.  Thanks, Liam.  They look like German Shepherds, but...  I'll just repeat what this guy said, but that's what I'd heard about them.  All right.  I want to pet one of those.  I think that's what the cop...  There was a cop that came up here, the canine guy.  Yeah.  And he had a beautiful...  Oh, remember that dog?  Oh, my...  And the dog was so friendly, because the cop was cool.  Oh, yeah.  So I just sat there and kissed it and petted it.  I think it's that dog. 
[00:44:30]  Because it looked like...  That's what I think it was.  Yeah, because it wasn't a German...  Yeah, that's...  It looked like a German Shepherd, but it wasn't.  Kenny...  I'll ask Kenny when he comes in.  Because I want that...  When you walk by that guy's police car, you can't get near the fucking car.  No.  Even if he's talking to you, the dog is so protective of the fucking...  The car.  Oh, yeah.  My sister has a big, friendly pit bull.  And, like, you can pet it and everything.  And he couldn't be nicer.  But you know, when you're petting it, that it's up to that pit bull whether things are  going to go good or not.  Whether your arm fucking leaves with you.  Yes.  A hundred percent. 
[00:45:00]  How big is it?  How much?  He's big.  Like, he's like...  A hundred pounds or...  It could be a hundred pounds.  He's a big dog.  And it's all muscle.  It's not...  He's not a fat dog.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He just runs.  How's your family dog?  Punch them as hard as you could and you won't do anything.  He's deaf and blind.  He's still around?  He's still around.  He lasted another year?  Oh, yeah.  He's fine.  I haven't been to your parents' house in about a year.  He's still around?  He just walks into shit.  He's literally deaf and blind completely.  And he's still alive.  Jesus.  Walks into chairs. 
[00:45:30]  Walks into walls.  And as soon as he bumps into anything, he starts biting.  Oh, man.  Great.  Because he doesn't know what the fuck it is.  He walks with his head down.  He's still alive?  Oh, he's doing fine.  I don't want to take him to the little, you know...  Because he's still wagging his tail.  ...the old blue fluid.  But he walks with his head down.  That way, he hits the top of his head onto walls so he doesn't, like, knock his nose  on stuff.  And he knows if he hits the top of his head, he's got to turn.  That's terrible.  Sometimes we'll catch him in a room by himself just barking at the air because he doesn't 
[00:46:00]  know whether or not people are in the air with him.  That's so sad.  That's sad.  You've got to kill it.  Do you move the furniture around in a room?  Oh, no.  And just watch him?  That's terrible.  The most muscular dog is the Bull Whippet, according to Jared in Pittsburgh.  Good to know.  I want to see the Bull Whippet before we close out this amazing topic.  Oh, yes.  A little animal-friendly topic today.  This is an amazing topic.  It really is.  I had to...  The phones are lit.  Look at this.  It is.  I had to clip... 
[00:46:30]  Jesus.  I had to clip...  Oh, my...  What is that?  That's crazy.  Come on.  That's not real.  The lower half of the dog looks like a greyhound.  What is that?  And then it gets all wide and shit as you get up near the head.  And the shoulders look like a human bodybuilder.  What is it?  It's a Bull Whippet.  It's a Bull Whippet.  That looks like...  Come on.  Jesus.  They're saying that's the most muscular dog in the world, I guess.  It's got to be.  It's a bodybuilder dog.  Yeah.  But is he mean or no?  Like, do they bite or are they just fucking muscular shitheads? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, wow.  That one doesn't look happy.  No, that looks like it would fuck you up.  He looks like one of those dogs from that movie.  What's that movie with fucking...  The Umbrella Corp...  Umbrella Corporation.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  Come on.  Help me out here, pal.  Talk.  The Umbrella Corporation.  Make it worth my while.  Resident Evil.  Thank you.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Resident Evil dogs where the zombie dogs would come fucking charging at you.  With the eyes.  That's what it looks like.  It looks crazy.  I want to get a dog that terrifies all. 
[00:47:30]  Yes.  I want a massive dog.  Crazy.  Just a big fucking 200-pounder.  Takes giant shit.  I don't have to clean up.  Because everyone in the neighborhood is scared of me.  There's also an Akita in our building.  And one day the Akita went after my sister's Pitbull.  Oh, man.  And that was all Akita.  Did you bet?  No, we separated the dogs immediately.  Oh, why?  Why don't we just separate them?  They can handle each other.  It's just nature.  Yeah, if it's nature and you didn't purposely do it, you've got to play it out.  That's what nature asked from you.  They were both on leashes. 
[00:48:00]  You mean you just let go of the leashes?  Yes.  Let it go.  You're not setting up the whole thing.  It bullied your sister's dog?  Yeah, it bullied the Pitbull.  Did the Pitbull cower or fight back?  Coward.  Oh.  But the dog had to fight back, though.  It might have been.  Would the Pitbull have killed it?  No, I think the Akita would have taken care of business.  Really?  What a pussy.  Yeah.  The Akita's even bigger than the Pitbull.  But the teeth, man.  The Pitbull's jaw is just so strong.  You're right.  You clamp down.  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Let's go to Josh in New York.  Josh. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Morning.  Look up a Presa Canario.  I have one.  They're fucking massive.  Are they the biggest dog in the world?  They may be.  Just look at a picture of them.  They're monsters.  They're very friendly dogs.  Well, we're looking at...  We can't tell how big they are because they don't have them next to anything.  It looks like that dog the Hulk fought.  Wait, you have one of those?  Now we're seeing it.  Yeah.  Pretty big. 
[00:49:00]  That's a big fucking dog.  Oh, my God.  That isn't even having a pet or a dog in a house.  It's a roommate.  It's another thing that's as big as a human in your house.  You've got to get a queen-sized bed.  Yeah.  It's going to fucking walk around your house like a person.  But it's just a little puppy.  Oh, look at them.  Puppies.  Adorable.  What are they called?  They are called Presa Canario.  And how big do they get, sir?  Yeah, how big is yours, Josh?  Ew.  God, he's...  Standing, he's bigger than me. 
[00:49:30]  Standing, bigger than you.  How much do you weigh?  100 pounds?  He's a midget.  But it's not impressive.  I'm about 5'5".  He's bigger than me.  He is.  Wow.  Don't make it sound like, wow, wowee.  He's bigger than me.  I'm 5'5".  Exactly.  You're not exactly fucking...  You're not exactly a Lakers prospect.  They're really good dogs.  They're not bad.  My one-year-old crawls all over them.  He'll lay there.  Yay!  Oh, Jesus.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Hang up the phone.  Get down with that little ladder. 
[00:50:00]  Get to work.  All right, Dan in Dayton, Ohio.  Dan, man.  Dayton?  Get it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Why do we know Dayton, Ohio?  I don't know.  I'm 18 years old.  Oh, that's right.  With two very bad knees.  Oh.  And then what?  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I know it happens.  You do?  Yep.  It didn't happen.  Nope, it didn't.  He was very disappointed.  I think God, the dream came true.  Oh, gee. 
[00:50:30]  I thought it was the other guy.  Nice.  All right.  You're from that place, huh, Dan?  Yeah, yeah, I am.  They're just not as amused as we are.  No, they're not.  Oh, well.  140 pounds, that guy's dog's good.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're having many conversations here.  Yes.  Hold on a second, Dan.  140 pounds, Jimmy?  Yeah, and I'm thinking the Belgian, the Malinois, as they're called, they get to be like  675 pounds.  Malimar?  So it's almost twice as heavy as those dogs.  Unbelievable.  Go ahead, Dan.  Yeah, so I was just talking about Connie Corso's earlier, and I have one. 
[00:51:00]  Awesome dog.  Awesome dog.  They're about 150 pounds.  Can you pop that in there, Sam, again?  Did we look at it?  The Cane Corso?  Yes.  Or the Cane Corso.  150 pounds, those things get?  Yeah, those are fucking...  Which one was that again?  I'm trying to remember.  Oh, yeah, that one.  Yeah, that thing is fucked up.  Looks like a hood dog.  Yeah, that does look like a fucking ghetto dog.  That dog looks scary, man.  150 pounds, that is a...  Are they nice dogs, Dan?  Oh, yeah, they're great.  They actually use those guys for, like, boar hunting. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, wow.  I really just had no energy to really...  This is too many boar fucking...  Boar, yeah.  Do they have jaws like a pit bull, or can they bite that hard?  Yeah, they're like one-third mouth.  Their head is about a third of their...  Sorry, a third of their head is their mouth.  Dude.  So they have tons of pressure.  You know the size of their dumps?  Ugh.  Disgusting.  This is great.  Like, we actually...  He's ours. 
[00:52:00]  Backpacks.  Like, carries a lot of our stuff for us.  They're really trainable.  So...  Oh, you can put a backpack on them?  A fucking...  Yeah.  A beast of burden?  A backpick?  I put a backpick on my dog.  I put a backpick on them?  Backpick, backpick.  I don't know why you guys are talking like that.  Because you do.  Oh.  Yeah.  I had to clip a little Beavis' nails yesterday for the first time.  I had to clip his little fucking nails.  Right.  I was standing by the sink.  Right.  And...  Did you go too far down?  No, no, no.  I suppose you got to know what you're doing. 
[00:52:30]  I'm a pro.  Okay.  I'm clipping cat nails.  All right.  I'm standing by the sink, and I just feel...  Up my leg, and he's pulling the fucking...  Climbing up my leg bit?  Your cat?  Yeah.  And I was wearing, like, very light sweatpants.  And all I was thinking is, if he gets to my fucking balls, it's over.  I'll toss him across the room.  It's only the beginning.  He got up there, so I was like, well, now it's time to clip your nails, so...  I clipped him, and now he can't climb up things very well.  Does it hurt when you clip him, or no?  No, no. 
[00:53:00]  You gotta...  You gotta clip the pointy part off.  Make sure you get the skin.  No!  But you look at the nail, there's like...  You're going too far down, you're going to fuck him up.  There's a part in the nail where it's red.  Right.  It looks a little reddish, and then over that isn't, and you just don't go into the red  part.  Oh, that's where you're supposed to go in there and get that...  No!  Scrape that red out.  That's the nerve or something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you get rid of it.  That'll hurt the...  There's a little blood vessel in there, and there's a nerve in there and stuff.  That's weird, like a mother.  You just do it before that, but I bought a little clipper and stuff.  Is he still cute, or is he still...  He's adorable. 
[00:53:30]  Still, though?  Yes.  Or is he getting a little bigger?  Still adorable.  Get a little bigger?  I posted one on Instagram last night, little guy.  Your shelf life, as far as making a viral video with this kitten, you know, you don't  have much more time left.  I don't have much more time?  No, man.  Because he's still a very little kitty.  Then they get too big, and then those videos don't do as well.  Look at him.  Oh, he is still tiny.  See, those are the sweatpants I was wearing.  Not very thick.  And when he gets his fucking claws in there, oh, boy.  Wait till he's just tearing holes through them.  No! 
[00:54:00]  Oh, I'll clip his nails.  He's very pet.  I want to go see your kitten before he's a big, dumb cat.  Yes, a big, dumb cat.  Don't want to give him his little stripes a kiss.  Little guy.  And he does a very cute thing when you're laying there and watching TV.  He'll lunge right at your face.  Jesus.  That's got to start.  Wait till he starts doing it this time.  There's Sam's giant fucking behemoth cat.  You're an enabler.  He used to be just a tiny little guy.  How much are you feeding that thing? 
[00:54:30]  Not much.  Tell the cat to stop eating.  Put all the food away.  Oh, that's good, too, because if he tries to skip a meal or something, he loves it.  He gets super friendly.  Oh, I bet.  He does.  Where's my fucking food?  He gets all pissed off.  He could beat half the dogs on this list.  Oh, man.  Oh, E-Rock.  That is a fat fucking cat.  Oh.  Jesus.  I hope E-Rock's feeling better.  You feeling better, E-Rock?  Sure.  Oh, God.  All right.  He's not feeling good.  I've got to eat before my toast gets soggy. 
[00:55:00]  So let's eat, motherfuckers.  All right.  Let's do that.  I had a big fucking killer German Shepherd.  No, you didn't.  That was his name.  Killer.  Really?  What happened to him?  Do you still have him?  Yeah.  No.  No, you don't.  You ran away a fuck.  You never had him.  You're a liar, Chip.  The OPNF3 Show.  O-R-A.  O-R-A.  On SiriusXM.  O-R-A.  SiriusXM. 
[00:55:30]  SiriusXM.  The OPNF3 Show.  Be my lover, be my lover, yeah.  Don't be afraid, I didn't mean to scare you.  So help me, Jesus.  This is a definitive AAF song.  I'm going to guess that E-Rock's playing this for the hell of it today.  Am I right?  Possum Kingdom, because we were talking about possums. 
[00:56:00]  What song is this?  That's Food, right?  The Toadies.  Possum Kingdom.  Is that why E-Rock?  Yes.  Yeah.  Is this Alt-Rock?  This was 94.  You know the song, Jimmy?  Tell me, Jesus.  I don't like it.  This was such a big song.  What was that request back at AAF?  Did we talk about where the guy would always call for the song, and he would go, you know  the song that goes, help me, Jesus?  So help me, Jesus.  He was trying to explain what song he wanted. 
[00:56:30]  So help me, Jesus.  So help me, Jesus.  I fucking love this song.  This is a song I'll never get sick of.  Give it up to me.  Give it up to me.  Yeah.  They had a frump bass player.  Yeah.  She was a bit frumpy.  A little frump.  I think she played bass.  What was the follow-up to this?  Oh, boy.  For the music people out there. 
[00:57:00]  It was a bit of a...  I come from the water.  That was them?  Was it?  I don't know.  Was it?  It was a bit of a drop-off, unfortunately.  This song is played a lot still on rock stations.  What was their second biggest song?  Away.  Away?  Away.  Oh, Away.  Away.  How does that go? 
[00:57:30]  Make up your mind.  I don't think I know this.  Yeah, I don't know this one.  I want to hear it kick in.  Nah.  They were a one-hit matter.  One sucks. 
[00:58:00]  Back in the 90s.  How do you come up with such a cool song like Possum Kingdom and that's it for you?  That's all you got.  Although they do have their fan base.  Yeah?  What's this one?  This was their other song.  I come from the water.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  This got some play.  Yeah, this got play.  On the only station that really rocks.  The Tony!  Oh, my God.  Remember this?  Yes.  And now music would play, so me and I would play the pen game.  We have to throw the pen and try to get it to flip up on the button console. 
[00:58:30]  The pen game.  We were bored shitless up there.  Of course we had to blow it up.  Fucking music.  We need to fucking talk more, Bruce.  What's wrong with you?  Like taking calls and shit during the song.  Everyone was surprised we blew it up.  Of course.  We could just walk out of the studio when the songs were playing.  Go into a little break room, take a piss, whatever.  Well, Brian would run the board for us.  Yeah.  We did exactly that.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Remember we tried to get our production done?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Remember that?  Trying to get production done.  We got 20 minutes.  We can do some production.  Brian will run the board.  Then we come back and make believe we were there the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  I got away with murder in Buffalo.  Yeah.  Because I was like still partying.  Sambuca shots were very, very big back in my Buffalo days.  On Allen Street there.  Wow, that would give you a heartburn.  So I would do like happy hour and all that. 
[00:59:30]  And then my shift would start at midnight.  And I was fucking tired, man.  So there was a guy that was running the AM part.  A young go-getter.  And I certainly was already out of the young go-getter stage.  Just fucking get him to do your dirty work.  Well, he wanted to be on the FM side so bad.  So I go, hey, man.  I forgot his name and I owe him a lot.  Because I was also helping the morning show.  So I didn't want to be tired for the morning show.  So I would record all my breaks for two or three hours. 
[01:00:00]  I go, all right, here's all the music.  Here's the breaks.  But you got to play them in order or you're going to fuck me.  Here's the commercials.  And you just run the whole show for me.  He was so excited.  Because what he had to do on the other side was push one lousy button every half hour.  Yeah.  Because it went to the network or some shit, some AM thing.  So he literally just had to go, boop, at the right time.  Yeah, yeah.  So he knew when he had to do that.  And then the rest of the time he ran the FM side for me.  Running a show. 
[01:00:30]  And it sounded like I was live.  But I would be in the break room fucking sleeping on a couch.  And then he would wake me up about an hour before the morning show would come in so I could get my shit together.  And then I would do the last hour live.  And then I would help the Bear Man.  And this guy started doing it on a regular basis for me.  And I got paid.  To just sleep.  Because you could do the breaks in a six-hour radio show in 15 minutes.  Yeah.  So I would do the 15 minutes, get all my breaks done. 
[01:01:00]  A little voice tracking.  A little voice tracking.  Then I would go snooze.  Where did I see Bear Man recently?  I think I just did a show.  Allentown.  Is that where it was, Kenny?  He's the king of Allentown Radio.  Love the Bear Man.  I thought it was somewhere else.  I don't remember.  He's from that area, I think.  I remember thinking West Coast.  Maybe it wasn't him.  It was one of your old...  One of my old guys is on the West Coast.  I don't know.  I see them.  I forget sometimes.  It was a Garth Hemp who's now doing weather. 
[01:01:30]  I see them.  Every time I go away or every other time I go away, there's one guy.  Oh, yeah.  I used to work with Opie or whatever.  And then some...  Half those guys are lying.  Maybe.  Looked like our pal, was it?  What?  Went real quick in the middle screen on CNN.  Our pal Bill Donahue.  Yeah, what is Bill Donahue talking about?  I guarantee you the Pope he's talking about.  The Pope.  Oh, really?  Who said that homosexuals were pedophiles?  Did I say that?  The suggestion is that all of this was consensual because of the age of...  He always has a problem. 
[01:02:00]  Consensual?  When people get raped, it's not consensual.  Look, as far as I'm concerned, the Catholic Church didn't handle this right.  I would have put these guys in the slammer a long time ago.  Instead, they just think they could reform them.  They said, I'm often a psychiatrist.  That's plain stupidity.  No, I'm...  There are very few who are going to disagree with that.  I mean, the way the Church handled the situation is a large part of the stain on the Church  right now.  But it is the discussion of homosexuality and the blame of them is somehow predatory.  That is what your Pope is telling you not to say.  It's not about what I think. 
[01:02:30]  This is what your Pope is telling you.  Most of the molesting priests were gay, and most gay priests are not molesters.  Good.  I think people can...  Stop there.  But that's all I've ever said.  No, but who says that the molesters were gay?  I'm telling you, if most...  Who says the molesters were gay?  They weren't girls, and they weren't...  Who says the molesters were gay?  Well, if a man has sex with a man, what would you call that?  He could be a deviant pedophile and a sick person.  Not if the kid is 18, 17, 16.  Years of age, a rapist could be straight or gay. 
[01:03:00]  I'll give you that much.  Being homosexual doesn't make you predatory.  Look, you're trying to say that anybody who points out the obvious,  that the Catholic Church had a homosexual scandal, therefore you're anti-gay.  This is absurd.  Listen, Mr. Donoghue, we both know that what is obvious here is that the Pope is asking you not to focus on these things.  He didn't ask me to shut up about the truth.  You and the Catholic League, you're the same organization that went forward and said,  when you're defending the passion, I'm a Mel Gibson fan,  when you're defending the passion, you say,  hey, you know, those secular Jews in Hollywood, they don't like the Catholics. 
[01:03:30]  It's a fact.  What?  Well, wait a minute.  This is the kind of thing that you shouldn't say anymore.  Do you want to get into, is it the Vietnamese who are making movies in Hollywood?  Is it the Puerto Ricans who won't Hollywood?  Do you understand how that sounds?  Do you understand how it sounds?  Do you know that the Jewish forward, the Jewish forward in its editorial said the exact same thing that I did?  So what?  Are they anti-Semitic?  So what?  Why would you say it?  Why would I say it?  Because I was just insulted on some guy on MSNBC, and I just gave it right back to him. 
[01:04:00]  Listen, am I insulting you?  No.  We're having a discussion.  No.  Why is this as fun?  What I'm saying is not fun for me, but here's why.  The Pope's giving you a different message.  He's saying, don't make these statements about the homosexuals.  Don't make these statements about the Jews.  Give back to what your church is about.  Jesus wasn't about what you're doing right now.  Are you going to hear that message or no?  Because it doesn't sound like it.  I've heard the message, but it's not the one that you will interpret for me.  So you think that the Pope wants you to say Jews don't like Catholics.  And that homosexuals, when they have sex with people a certain age, must be predatory. 
[01:04:30]  When did I say that Jews don't like Catholics?  You were quoted.  No, I'm talking about secular Jews who run the Hollywood studios who make anti-Catholic movies.  What is so absurd about that?  The absurdity is that you are blaming it on a faith and a culture when it is a subjective judgment about a movie.  So you're blaming these people.  So if I mention that the Chinese live in Chinatown,  am I considered now a bigot to point out the obvious? 
[01:05:00]  No, but if a Chinese person makes something you don't like  and you then decide to blame them because they're Chinese,  as opposed to what's made...  Well, the Catholics seem to get blamed for every time we complain about a movie.  We're blamed for this.  It's the church, and so I get blamed for this.  You get blamed for what I do?  One of the things I get blamed for, of course, you're a huge organization.  What would you get blamed?  The Catholic League matters.  The Catholic League is relevant.  Right or wrong, it is.  Maybe I get blamed for what Andrew Cuomo does.  Because he's Catholic.  That would be a good switch for you.  Let me tell you.  I don't think I'd be going south.  Listen, the point is, what are you going to do with this message from the Pope? 
[01:05:30]  Listen, I happen to agree.  We have different interpretations, obviously.  I love the Pope.  And I do think that there are single-issue Catholics on the left and the right  who need to get out of their little micro-turf battles  and look at the macro-issue.  It should be about salvation.  I will grant you that, and I am so happy that he has said it.  He's also said that he has a problem with the rigorous priests,  you know, the right-wing authoritarians.  He also said, if people actually read what he said in his interview,  he's against those priests who are too lax.  He said, and by that he meant those who deny the existence of sin. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, there's a problem on the left with that, just as there's a problem on the right.  He identifies himself as a sinner first when they ask him about the man, Bergoglio.  I know, and everybody thinks this is breaking news.  Every single Pope throughout all of history went to confession.  Why did he go to confession?  Because he's a sinner.  There's no breaking news there.  I guess I think that his hope is that the people who call themselves devout Catholics  get back to the main mission of the church, which is not division.  It is love, and it is understanding that there is good in all. 
[01:06:30]  So you think the nuns on the bus then are bringing everybody together  by going out there in favor of Obamacare against what the bishops wants?  They're the ones who are divisive.  The dissidents ones typically are on the left, but not exclusively.  I'm thinking what he wants is for you to spend less time bashing nuns  and more time bringing people together.  I don't bash nuns.  I'm just simply pointing out that some of the polyesters have lost their mission.  They should not be social workers.  They should be nuns tending to the poor.  I think the one thing we'll agree on for sure is that we hope that the Pope's message is understood. 
[01:07:00]  Yes, I do.  Mr. Donahue, thank you for taking the opportunity.  Thank you so much.  Kate, over to you.  Wow.  Thanks so much, Chris.  Coming up next on New Day.  You know what the Pope said?  Huh?  It was shockwave.  The Pope said cunt.  The Pope said cunt.  You were sitting next to Otto Peterson on a plane.  He said gay.  He was the first Pope to say gay.  He said he's tired.  He said the church has become obsessed.  Yes, obsessed.  With homosexuality and abortion, and he said we put dogma above caring for people and above caring for the poor and the, what was the other word he used, the marginalized. 
[01:07:30]  I read that on the way in.  I fucking couldn't.  I'm like, I love this Pope.  He's amazing.  The last guy was a cunt.  I'm sorry.  The last guy was a fucking doctrine-obsessed twat who wanted a smaller, purer church.  This Pope wants a larger, more inclusive church.  What Donnie is saying, though, is I can see what he's saying, absolutely, not to obsess on those issues, but it doesn't mean that there's this new openness in church that is accepting homosexuals and abortion. 
[01:08:00]  But abortion, I agree with you on.  I think that's a rough one to get the church to upset all the stem cells they should shut the fuck up about.  But with the homosexuality, this Pope is not like the, he doesn't want to live where the last one lived.  He has to be close to the people.  I don't think he gives a shit about homosexuality.  I really don't.  Because he said something about who am I to judge?  Yeah.  About gay priests.  That was a big fucking thing for a Pope to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  First time, he, first time a Pope just said the word gay. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, really?  That's what it said in the paper today.  No Pope would even say the word.  What about the old days when they meant happy?  Oh, that's a good point.  We're going to have a very gay time at the Vatican tonight.  Very good point.  Very gay time at, uh...  Getting blunt.  Pope Francis says, don't be small.  He wants his fellow priests and shit to get out there among the people.  It was really earth-shattering what he said.  And where is he living?  I forget where. 
[01:09:00]  Is he in the Vatican, but in a smaller part of it or something?  Yeah, he's closer.  They said it in the article I read where he lived.  It was, he wants to be, he carries his own luggage.  He's really fucking, he's the real deal, this guy.  He's not some pious jizz bag.  That fucking last one was, they got him out.  He was, he was losing members fucking fast.  You think he was pushed out?  Without, he had Parkinson's or he had, uh, not Parkinson's, I'm sorry, Alzheimer's.  It was one of those things.  No, they pushed him out because you're supposed to die in the position.  How bad of a Pope do you have to be?  They push you the fuck out. 
[01:09:30]  The pedophilia scandal was tied to him.  Yeah, yeah.  It was tied to him, he was a fucking, he was a Nazi-looking twat that I fucking hated  that fucking guy.  And John Paul, fuck him too.  The exact quote from the Pope, if someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has  good will, who am I to judge?  Well, if he searches for the Lord.  See, he still doesn't like.  He'll judge a gay guy that isn't searching for the Lord, that's searching for some ass.  That ain't gonna fucking get on that shit.  I don't know.  I just don't see the Catholic Church as being very accepting toward gays. 
[01:10:00]  This Pope is, I'm telling you, is really fucking...  Think he might be able to wheel a fucking little gayness in there?  No, but he's...  What did he say?  He said, uh...  He said he's in shockwaves through the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, that he said  the church had grown obsessed with abortion, gay marriage, and contraception, and he had  chosen not to talk about these issues despite recriminations from his critics.  Ah.  It was a surprise.  He said that he criticized the church for putting dogma before love and for prioritizing 
[01:10:30]  moral doctrines over serving the poor and marginalized.  Hmm.  He articulated his vision of an inclusive church, a home for all, which is a striking...  Home for all.  A striking contrast with Pope Benedict, the doctrinal defender...  What was his eggs?  Who, uh...  The doctrinal defender who envisioned a smaller purer church.  So, uh...  This guy said...  Pope Francis said, it's not necessary to talk about these issues all the time. 
[01:11:00]  The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent.  The church's pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude  of doctrines to be imposed insistently.  Wow.  It's such a weird position.  The church has, uh, with, um, the changing times and with, with modern society.  Like, years ago, obviously, people had to adhere to every little rule. 
[01:11:30]  There was, you know, the old day Inquisition.  Um, but in this day and age of inclusion and tolerance and everything, it's so hard to  steadfastly stick to these, uh, issues of years ago and still have a large amount of  members.  And that's what you need.  You need a lot of fucking people and you're alienating some by, you know, going against  the gay.  And he said, at least, lastly, we have to find a new balance.  Otherwise, even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Losing the freshness and fragrance of the gospel.  And, uh, they said his interview did not change doctrine, but it instantly changed the  church's tone.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, that's a very powerful thing he said.  Yeah.  And the conservative, the real conservative Catholics will hate it.  Oh, sure.  Like, Donnie, he probably doesn't like it, but it's great.  They, uh, well, that's what he's saying.  He was on there saying, like, look, I heard what he said, but I'm interpreting it as blah,  blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He knows what he said.  Bill, of course he does.  Bill's just a, he's a very smart guy and he's a deceptively bright debater. 
[01:12:30]  He's a very good debater.  He's a regular guy and he, and you can get him on a point and he's okay with it.  Yeah, he'll laugh it off.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, okay, but, and then he'll ram you at something else.  And he makes some, and he also makes some fucking valid kind of blunt points that aren't  overly polite or, you know.  Yeah.  And he's smart.  It's hard when you're arguing with somebody that doesn't feel like they're, um, walking  on eggshells when, when you're talking.  Cause they always try to back up guys.  And, and this guy was doing it too. 
[01:13:00]  I was interviewing Donnie.  You try to back a guy into a corner with sounding like a homophobe or racist or something  and you back him in.  And the second you do that and the person starts going, but I, but I, but I, it puts  him on the defensive.  If you just turn around and say like, Hey, if I say Chinese people live in Chinatown, but  like that takes such a huge piece of their ammunition away.  Yeah.  I love, and that's what, that's why I love being able to talk openly, uh, on this show, especially  about things like race and sexuality and stuff, because it takes away any ammunition someone 
[01:13:30]  has to try to pigeonhole you and call you a racist.  Fine.  I've been called that for years.  Who gives a shit at this point?  Sometimes I want, like, I think like we're really lucky, like, even though there's irritations  here, but we really, we can just sit and just fucking almost say whatever we want.  Discuss things, you know, not, not inciting, not hate speech or anything, but literally  have an open discussion with real language that real people use and not be persecuted  for it.  It's a miracle that this fucking exists.  And a lot of the irritations are now gone. 
[01:14:00]  So yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, exactly.  I hear what you're saying right there, which sags into a fine song.  Oh, what?  Oh my God.  What?  One last.  Who made this?  One last jab.  One last poke, huh?  Who made this?  Uh, Jefferson K.  It's the, uh, same person.  He, we played one of his songs the other day.  Oh, yeah.  The, um.  Who was he on Twitter?  Of course.  I don't know.  These guys need their Twitter plugs.  Jefferson Knight on Twitter. 
[01:14:30]  Jefferson Knight on Twitter.  Uh, came up with a, uh, goodbye song for, um, for the Radio Wizard.  Oh.  Who I would, would bet officially doesn't listen to us anymore.  Oh.  This is the artist who performed, uh, Fat Fuck and He Knows It that we played yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Fat Fuck and He Knows It.  Is that Jake?  No.  I thought it was Jake Gyllenhaal.  What are they doing on Fox?  No, uh, doing like this stupid obstacle course on Fox.  No.  No.  What are they doing?  They're running through an obstacle course right downstairs on the sidewalk. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Why is the chick winning?  Oh, well, she can't do the tire.  Yeah, she fell on the tire.  Get in front of it.  Don't wait behind it.  Fucking bitch.  Why does Fox feel they have to do these fucking stunts every, every morning?  They're a morning zoo now.  This is morning zoo shit.  That's easy.  I did that in the Marine Corps.  Oh, that rope went right up our cunt. 
[01:15:30]  Kevin's trying to be way too polite.  He's waiting behind.  They are muddy.  They are wet.  And they're about to get wetter.  And we go to the bottom.  Oh, yeah, bottom.  And then they slide down into water.  What are they fucking children?  This was acid.  They didn't tell her.  Now, what did that do?  There's 20 people out there.  I had mud in my teeth.  All right.  And here we go.  Here's mud in your teeth. 
[01:16:00]  I threw my arm out.  How was it, Kevin?  I threw my arm out in the first.  You got the deucey injury?  I got the deucey injury.  Oh, my God.  This is news.  Hi.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Having real conversations here.  And they're getting wacky on Fox and Friends.  By the way, a dozen people were shot in Chicago last night.  Just an aside.  Just an aside.  A dozen people were shot in Chicago last night.  Murder's down in Chicago this year, by the way.  Still the murder capital of the U.S. 
[01:16:30]  Over 300.  What are they up to?  381, I think, for the year.  Yeah.  Murder capital of the U.S.  Did you see the girl beat the boy, though, at the physical fitness challenge?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that.  As long as you saw that.  By the way, if it was the lone white gunman,  thing, and he was shooting people,  it would be the lead story.  They would put off the obstacle course and stuff.  But because it's Chicago and it's just black people killing other black people,  a three-year-old, by the way, was shot last night also.  Jesus.  In critical condition.  Why a three-year-old was out at 10 p.m. 
[01:17:00]  at a basketball fucking, at a park basketball game is beyond me.  But whatever.  Would you even go to a basketball court in Chicago?  No.  What?  No.  No.  No, thanks, Jimmy.  I love basketball.  I was brought up with basketball.  Yeah.  Even in New York City, I don't like walking by basketball courts.  You're always looking.  You just know.  Oh, yeah.  Some shit's gone down there.  You know some shit's going on.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what the shit is, but something's going on.  Something's going on. 
[01:17:30]  A little bit, a little bit.  I used to go to the comics a few years ago with Patrice and Keith and actually Kevin Hart  and a couple other guys would go and Sherrod, and they would play in these courts.  And I remember one time we were there.  I was dating a girl named Ruth at the time, a British girl.  And this group of guys from the projects or whatever came out, and I was like, oh, it's  going to be a problem.  But it wasn't.  They just wanted to play in, and it was okay.  Oh, you thought it was going to be a little issue?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I was just sitting there with Ruth.  We were like two white girlfriends of the players. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, God.  Just sitting there watching.  White girlfriends.  Did nothing.  Didn't get out there?  No.  No?  12 shot last time.  Bob Kelly played, too, I think.  Yeah.  Well, I figured.  Bob was slim then, and fucking Bobby.  In good shape?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Had that fucking little Hispanic look to him, right?  I didn't realize how awful Bob's old Egyptian hairdo was until I fucking see it now.  Egyptian.  I'm like, oh, my God, he's like a fucking coin.  How's Bobby doing?  Bobby good?  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  I haven't seen him in a while, yeah.  It's been a while.  We've got to get him on the show.  Daddy Bobby, I see him in his Vine videos.  His kid's amazingly cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amazingly cute.  In his Vine.  He's moving out to Westchester.  I hear.  Is he?  Fuck yes.  What's he doing there?  Well, you have a kid, and then you move out of the city.  That's what happens.  Out of the apartment.  Okay.  I hear you.  What about me, though?  They're not thinking of me.  I know.  Where am I supposed to go on fucking Thanksgiving?  Where am I?  My friends are leaving.  Where am I going to go?  You've got to take a little ride.  I don't want to take a ride.  It's traffic. 
[01:19:00]  You're the people that make the traffic up.  Selfish Bob and his selfish wife not thinking of me and how I like to get up late and go  see my friends.  Imagine being serious and being like, what about me?  Yee.  Yeah, I'm bummed that they're leaving, but I'm happy for them.  Someone videoed a bus driver texting while she's driving the bus.  Oh, my God.  That bitch is in trouble.  So fired.  To point A to point B in a safe condition, that's not safe.  In a what condition?  And then if they, not only are they going to kill the driver, they're going to kill those 
[01:19:30]  children on that bus.  Currently, 41 states ban texting for all drivers, and only three states specifically  ban school bus drivers from texting.  Check out this video of another Florida bus driver texting on his cell.  Oh, my God.  Later, he was involved in a fender bender.  He was suspended without pay for weeks.  And watch as this Florida driver fumbles with her phone using both hands, constantly glancing  down at one time for nearly 10 seconds. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Suspended for one day.  Suspended for one day.  Suspended for one day.  Suspended for one day.  Suspended for one day.  Suspended for one day.  Suspended for one day.  Suspended.  Jesus.  It is against school district policy for a bus driver to text while driving.  Oh.  From the video, it appears the driver is certainly looking at her cell phone.  Oh, well, looking at the phone.  That's a dangerous distraction for any driver.  But the potential danger is greater when you have a bus full of children.  If a bus driver is doing something that is against our policies, then we're going to do something 
[01:20:30]  about that.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, one day suspension.  One day suspension.  Yeah, one day suspension.  One day suspension.  Scary indeed.  And as for the school bus driver's question, you should note, she is not currently driving  the bus.  The district investigating to determine what action to take.  The second.  The important thing there is I wonder if the school district.  Looks like they're going to interview a bus next.  Oh, that's the big woman.  Oh, I thought they were going to interview the bus itself.  The 14-year-old is using their cell phone.  Oh, boy.  And was trying to capture that.  And then look what she caught instead. 
[01:21:00]  It's so often times, it proves the point that our kids are paying attention.  Oh, shut up.  They are listening to these messages about not doing it themselves, right?  They're little rats.  Especially these new drivers.  It's so interesting that the tables turn, and she pointed out to the adult that they  were misfeeding.  She's huge.  Thank you.  I mean, you know, we see, every time I see, I don't know about you guys, any time I see  someone texting on the road, I'm like that crazy lady.  No!  I know!  And you're going to cause an accident doing that.  Exactly.  I think all the time when someone's weaving on the road and they're always texting.  It's the same problem that police are dealing with and trying to get all of us 
[01:21:30]  to stop texting while we're driving.  The school is dealing with.  The school doesn't obviously want any bus driver to be texting, but what more can  you do other than take away their phones while they're on the job?  I noticed you were weaving.  And then there he is, making a basket.  A good little skit.  Obviously that's the policy.  Now they have to look and see what I'm going to take here.  Right.  It gets a little tricky, right?  Because sometimes, as the bus driver, you are allowed to use the cell phone, but the  texting would be something different.  Obviously.  How is that tricky?  That is... 
[01:22:00]  This guy's an idiot.  I know that that was a very silly thing for me.  Cuomo Son.  That's Cuomo Son.  Oh!  The fucking lump of shit doesn't fall far from the asshole.  When that was pointed out to me, with a certain intensity, I took the message.  Yes, sir.  Oh, his grandfather was the Mario.  Mario!  Mario!  Mario!  Mario!  Yes.  How did it go?  I forgot.  Something, something, something, something.  Exactly.  Are they still talking about texting? 
[01:22:30]  Okay, thank you so much.  Alright!  Yes, they are.  A bizarre encounter between a priest and a photographer.  Providing the bride and groom at their wedding with some very...  They just play viral videos now, apparently.  And we just...  And we just play the news of them.  We watch.  We watch.  It really, the news has just turned into fucking YouTube.  It's, uh...  Texting.  It's astounding.  Texting is fucking out of control, though.  On the roads.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could see...  It is...  I think you said it first on this show, and I absolutely, absolutely agree with you. 
[01:23:00]  I'd rather see a drunk driver.  I am.  Not hammered drunk driving down the wrong side.  No, but if you had to make a choice, I would rather be on the road with a drunk driver.  I'd rather...  That texting is out of control on the roads.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's so obvious, too, now.  So obvious.  It's broad daylight.  You got somebody either going from 40 miles an hour to 60 in the left lane.  Right.  They can't keep their speed constant.  They're fucking... 
[01:23:30]  You go to pass them, and they're drifting over into your lane, and then they cut back...  Well, they do that quick move back into their lane, because that's them looking back up from their phone.  Right.  They look over, and there they are.  One hand fucking the phone.  They're looking down.  I was...  It pisses me off.  I was completely guilty when I had my BlackBerry, because I could feel the keys.  Oh.  As soon as I got my Samsung Galaxy S3, soon to be the S4, I stopped.  Yeah.  Because I can't feel the buttons, obviously, anymore.  So that was what made me stop.  That's the only reason I stopped. 
[01:24:00]  The voice helps a little bit, but you got to still read it.  Right.  It's just dangerous.  Sam heard me one time, we were coming back, and I was talking dirty into my phone.  Yeah.  He was sexting with a girl.  He didn't listen to you sexting?  Yeah.  And I was like, why do you have to do that now?  You're driving.  Oh, well.  And what did he say?  Do you remember?  It's my sex addiction.  I don't remember what he said.  I remember us talking about how furious my mom would be if he got into an accident and  killed me on our drive home.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He was sexting. 
[01:24:30]  How funny that would be.  Wouldn't be funny at all.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm gonna suck on your clit.  And I had to go back in reverse and take the P and put a T because the dumb fucking  Siri doesn't know what a clit is.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Speaking of fucking phones.  Oh, boy.  Was I having a fucking issue with the new iOS 7.  By the way.  Sweetie.  Going on.  A lot of people saying the iOS 7 is Android.  It's a lateral move.  They did it to make it look more like Android. 
[01:25:00]  It's a stupid move.  Sneaking that Android shit into the into the iPhones.  And last night I'm trying to take some video and they changed the camera around, you know,  and then it's got you could just kind of sideways scroll from pano to square picture photo and video.  Okay.  By swiping this the screen right aside.  Well, the video option just disappeared off my phone last night.  I go to take video.  It was gone.  And then all of a sudden it comes back and then it's gone again.  Just so fucking annoying. 
[01:25:30]  I don't like the way anything looks.  The calendar is shit.  The calendar is shit.  You can't look at it at a glance.  The old one you can look at at a quick glance and see the days in the month that you were doing something.  It would change the color of the square.  Now this.  We don't need a grid for a calendar.  We'll just put the numbers on the screen.  And put a tiny fucking can't even really notice it dot next to the date.  Doesn't yours just go wrong?  I don't want mine going right to date.  I want it to go up to the month.  And mine opens up until the day.  Yes. 
[01:26:00]  Does your open to the day of the month?  I want it to go.  Mine opens to the.  I don't know.  Let me see.  I think I have my opening to the month.  I hate that it does that.  How do you have it do that?  I don't know.  I put.  Oh, I use the little thing here.  Dink, dink.  And went back.  Sideways.  Like back.  Yeah, no.  But when it first opens, like close it now.  Yeah.  And then reopen it, you bag of shit.  And see what happens.  Alright.  It opens at the month.  Oh, how do you do that?  I don't know.  But, but I don't like, I like the grid. 
[01:26:30]  Right?  And then, and then when you look like on the third.  What did I have on the third?  I had.  Hopefully AIDS.  I had the dentist on the third.  Aww.  And, uh, look, now there's a tiny gray dot under the three.  Instead of the grid having the whole thing for the third be a different color.  And you could look real quick and go, oh, I'm doing something that day.  It's terrible!  Peepers aren't what they used to be, huh? 
[01:27:00]  It is terrible.  It's terrible.  The old eyes.  It has nothing to do with that.  Oh.  Anyone would say that that's a shitty fucking thing.  Oh.  Oh my God.  Do you like watching the icons move?  No.  The moving icon thing is stupid.  I mean, I mean, if it, that was just an aside for a really great update, it would be,  it would be cool as fuck.  But I texted, I tweeted last night.  I said, uh, they're gonna lose me to the Samsung.  What?  What happened?  What?  What? 
[01:27:30]  Did you say Samsung?  I did.  I said, oh, now I can be part of the conversation.  Yay!  I said, Apple's gonna lose me to the Samsung.  Ooh, I better, what?  Because I'm so sick of this Apple bullshit.  What the fuck?  How does yours open into the month?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I went.  Uh-oh.  Where's your calendar?  Oh my lord.  New iPhone today, right?  Yes. 
[01:28:00]  And the China deal.  The China deal goes down?  No, I never watched.  The China deal officially goes down.  You're always good with that inside info.  The China deal actually.  Oh, now it's mine.  Ah.  See?  It goes into effect today, the China deal.  Right.  In the upper left.  We'll see what the stock does.  Oh, boy.  China deal.  In effect today.  Ain't gonna do shit.  iPhones are on sale in China.  Correct.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Let's see what that does with the stock.  Oh, boy.  I'll tell you what's through the roof.  Thanks to the phenomenal management in this fucking company. 
[01:28:30]  Sirius XM stock.  Yeah, it is.  What is it up to?  Almost $4.  It was fucking.  It was.  And fucking.  Oh, my God.  $3.96 a share.  Yeah.  Ugh.  $3.96 a share.  And Mel gave me the elbow.  Like, buy some stock, kid.  Did he?  When it was 10 cents.  I wish I would have bought more.  And I went, ah.  I should have bought more.  Fucking millions of shares.  Yup.  I should have bought more.  Imagine.  Oh, my God.  Imagine.  Just pump and dump. 
[01:29:00]  Pump and dump the shit.  Pump and dump the shit out of it.  Pump and dump.  You gotta fucking buy when there's blood in the street.  That's what Rockefeller said.  Well, that's why Apple might be a good buy with the China deal going into effect today.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see.  How is it in pre-market trading?  Well, you know.  It's down a little.  We should take a break.  We did nothing during this one.  It's all right.  The stock's up.  We're doing something right.  Nice.  Oh, I get it.  All right.  I have a very special announcement, too.  Can I just make sure people know we got our podcast out there?  Yes.  Podcast number 19 is available for your downloading pleasure. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  Uh, there's a link on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  It's on iTunes.  It's everywhere.  It doesn't matter what phone you got.  You can figure out how to get it.  That's up to you.  Stop asking me.  It's really not difficult.  I don't understand why I still get those tweets.  Anybody who has any sort of thing that you listen to podcasts on.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  And it'll pop up.  Oh, good.  And we're up to the 19th one.  Oh, yeah.  And it's the cinnamon challenge.  It's E-Rock's heroes list.  The long form.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:30:00]  Uh, and Patrice's rock coat.  But that's the long form, too.  Oh, yeah.  So there's the whole discussion about the cruise ship thing.  Right.  And then Patrice gets into the rock coat thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Legendary.  Great.  Very, very cool.  So go get that for us, all right?  And, uh, Jimmy's got a big announcement.  Very special announcement.  Today at 10 a.m., my tickets with Dice go on sale for the Beacon Theater November the  1st.  And, uh, apparently there was a pre-sale which has sold extremely well.  Right.  It was an email pre-sale which I didn't even know about.  Great. 
[01:30:30]  So, um, today at 10 a.m., check out our November 1st show and go to Ticketmaster.com.  The show, I believe, will sell out.  I'm very happy about that.  We're going to do some more dates.  And, uh, Friday and Saturday, October 11 and 12, I'll be in the Comedy Cabaret working  on material in Doylestown.  Friday is sold out.  And I should check the counts because Saturday might be sold out, too.  I don't know.  Comedy Cabaret!  I hate that guy.  We forgot to play the Gary song.  Oh, damn it.  I knew we got to keep going here. 
[01:31:00]  So, most people know the Radio Wizards officially out.  We haven't seen them since the big announcement a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, no.  He couldn't be less interested.  There was a very, uh, very weak hello in the hallway when I did see him.  Nothing.  We passed each other.  There's nothing there.  But anytime I see him, he's all smiles.  The last time he came down to the studio to say we had the big meeting with Scott and  at that point we did not know the Tim Sabian thing was going down.  Yeah.  He said, no, it's really good news.  Yeah.  That was the last time we talked. 
[01:31:30]  That was two weeks ago.  He doesn't have to deal with us anymore.  And this guy, Jeffrey Knight on Twitter, put together a little Gary is Gone song.  Oh.  It's all about the songs these days.  The listeners are all about it.  Jefferson Knight.  What did I say, Jeffrey?  I think so.  Jefferson Knight on Twitter.  Oh, I will see you next time. 
[01:32:00]  dude, you've been doing a Initiative, but I don't like it because you love you.  You're upstairs in accounting.  It took four years too long.  Too bad that you are balding.  Doesn't have a single hair.  Now that you're finally gone, the show will be the best in years. 
[01:32:30]  Thank God Gary's gone.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Thank God Gary's gone.  Gone.  Thank God Gary's gone.  Gone.  Gary's gone.  The radio wizard was a joke to me.  He's finally gone.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Can't save me in his hair.  He'll turn the show around now.  He'll get shit done.  There'll be no trash on the ground now.  All he is finally gone.  About fucking time now.  So grab your trophy and get the fuck out. 
[01:33:00]  So get the fuck out.  Gary, he's gone now.  Not bad.  Not too sad.  A little shoehorn in there with Tim Seby Yen.  Not bad.  Did Scott and Todd do a parody song yesterday or today?  We played yesterday's.  I'll find out.  All right.  And I see the participation trophy still in the studio.  He has not come in to take it.  Again, I think very insulted that he's being offered a trophy that says world's greatest secretary. 
[01:33:30]  Secretary.  I should put that in a place of pride.  The world's greatest anything is flattering, don't you think?  I think so.  All right.  So we should come down and get it.  It should be a good sport and take his participation trophy.  Bastard.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll break and get into some other shit.  I just saw Pete Correale walk by.  Is that who that was?  Yeah.  He should come in and say hi.  What, Ed?  Can we get him on the show? 
[01:34:00]  Is he doing Pete Dominick's show?  I think so.  We can get him on.  Yeah.  We'll have him come in and say hi.  What the hell?  He's a good dude.  Funny dude.  He's a very funny guy.  And we got Stalker Patty stopping by for her, what, annual visit?  Oh, Christ.  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  Even in emoticons, she's infuriating.  Travis was, like, Google chatting or something.  And he said, okay, Patty, you're all set for tomorrow.  And she sent him this giant smiley face emoticon.  Like, that took up the whole window.  And Travis just looked at me like, look how big the fucking smiley face that she sent me is. 
[01:34:30]  Exactly.  She's using valuable vacation minutes to come in here, though.  She gets minutes on the week.  Good for her.  Can't wait to hear what her newest fucking problems are.  Last time she was here, she was talking about that free checkup that a cat was getting.  Right.  And I do want to ask her about that, because we fucking ragged her so badly about how it was going to be a ripoff. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  And it was a ripoff.  Oh, you know?  Yes.  It was a ripoff.  Remember, she was all excited because they offered her...  I got a postcard for a vet that's here in the area, and it's a free checkup for my cat, so I'm gonna go.  And we're like, Patty, that's how they get you in there.  And then she's like, she was on Facebook, and she said something like, hi, my cat needs...  And it's like some fucking thing the cat needs, or it's gonna die.  Of course. 
[01:35:30]  And it's like $1,000.  Like, Patty, no, that's how this guy fucking works.  Yeah.  So I want to see how that turned out, if she got fucking rooked.  Or listened to everybody's fucking advice and didn't pay the guy.  Well, she's great.  I mean, let's be honest with each other.  She's amazing.  Dunce.  And we'll learn another little tidbit...  I'm sure.  ...about her pathetic life.  Surely.  But she's really happy.  Good.  We could all learn from Stalker Patty. 
[01:36:00]  Most people with limited mental capabilities are happy.  See ya.  The OPNN 3 Show.  The OPNN 3 Show.  On SiriusXM.  SiriusXM.  SiriusXM.  Yeah.  This is the OPNN 3 Show.  Wow.  It was good. 
[01:36:30]  I'm living with you.  Wow.  The OPNN 3 Show.  Better than Ezra.  Very good.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They sounded like the Toadies, so...  A little...  The OPNN 3 Show.  The OPNN 3 Show.  But there's nobody home.  Uh-oh.  It was good.  Oh, baby.  When you...  Wow.  Yeah.  This is...  What are we doing?  Some 90s stuff?  Are you watching? 
[01:37:00]  We're doing Alt-Rock 1995.  Nice.  I like it.  I like it.  Oh, yeah.  The notes fall down, but the letters...  Oh, the B-80s.  Oh, oh.  Give me a scar.  Give me a scar.  Oh, oh.  I had, uh...  You did?  I had finally gotten around to GTA 5.  Oh, nice.  And...  Finally.  Oh, no.  So it was a bad copy from Laszlo.  Look, I don't know what the fuck is going on at my house. 
[01:37:30]  I bought a new copy, right?  Yep.  And, uh, I put it in, and it was pulling the same shenanigans.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  And it was two separate Xboxes in my house.  So how is it doing the same thing with two separate...  So I kept futzing with it, and it finally loaded.  Because isn't it hard to get a bad copy these days?  Yeah.  Yeah, it kind of is.  Unless you do something to the copy and scratch it up or whatever.  But besides that, I would imagine it would be really hard to get a bad copy out of the box. 
[01:38:00]  I think so.  So I gave the copy to Vinny, my old copy, and he told me, he goes, oh, it booted right  up.  Wow.  It's not even a fucking issue.  So I have to wait until fucking, you know, the new Xbox comes out.  But I was able to play it.  It finally loaded.  Okay.  And I was playing, and I ran through a few missions.  I can't get enough of the black gentleman in the game.  I know.  Wow.  Lamar.  And what's the other guy's name?  Franklin?  Franklin?  No, I know, right?  I was thinking that.  The dialogue between the two are hilarious. 
[01:38:30]  Do you feel like it's realistic language?  It's very realistic language.  I thought it was hilarious.  And what I, I spent hours driving around as Franklin in the nice neighborhoods, and I  would get out and just beat the shit out of white people.  I got to tell you, it's fun.  I got to tell you, I kind of get it.  It's enjoyable, huh?  You kind of get it now.  I just walk up to white people and start punching them and kicking them and beating 
[01:39:00]  them down.  Finally, you're seeing the other side for what it is.  I found it very entertaining.  For hours.  I was driving to the nice neighborhood just fucking up white people.  That rules.  It was great.  Did you do the Facebook mission?  They're talking about that on the news today.  No, I ran through.  They're basically saying this part of the game, you could pretty much blow up, you know,  the creator of Facebook.  Oh, really?  It's not really called Facebook in the game.  You can't really tell.  It's kind of a mixture of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, but they're basically saying it's Facebook.  Yeah.  It's an awesome mission.  And what?  The guy answers the phone and then he blows up?  Because that's the still I saw in the paper today.  Yeah, you have to, you break into this company's building.  Right.  And then you have to put a chip in the phone.  What's that?  And then you have to go back to your house.  Yeah.  You turn on the TV so you can watch his big unveiling, his keynote address.  Oh, okay.  And then he takes out the phone to show you what he's working on.  And you're watching.  And then you call the phone from your phone and he goes, oh, I got a call. 
[01:40:00]  And he puts it up to his head and it blows into smithereens.  So that's Steve Jobs.  Yeah.  So why are they saying Zuckerberg on the news today?  Because when he's talking, there's like social networking language.  He's introducing it like Steve Jobs does.  Right.  But the product is more closely.  Do you think they mix it like that so you couldn't say it was totally one or the other?  Absolutely.  Fuck yeah.  They're getting really smart.  Oh, yeah.  Because now, you know, to keep it going, everyone's talking about this one particular mission on the news. 
[01:40:30]  They don't want to get it.  They don't want to get it.  It was in our paper today.  And it's funny.  You could tell, too, because all the people report, like, that's a really early mission.  Yeah.  So all the people who are outraged just haven't gotten that far in the game yet.  Oh, by the way, I started as the black guy driving around in the crappy neighborhood because that's kind of where you are.  Right.  And I got out, and I saw, like, this other black guy hanging out, and I punched him in the face.  And two other black guys ran over, started beating me, and then I was stabbed to death. 
[01:41:00]  Why?  That's when I realized I'm going to go to the white neighborhood and just hit up the white people.  Where there's no gang, black-on-black crime?  They run and go, oh, leave me alone!  Did you shoot any of them?  Yeah, I shot some white people, too.  Was it fun?  Yeah, it was fun.  There was some woman, and she was running away, and I just stopped, aimed, and fucking shot her in the back.  It was a pisser.  Yeah.  A lot of fun.  And I can't tell you how many cops I fucking shot last night.  Oh, my God.  I shot my fair share of police officers in that game, too. 
[01:41:30]  They pull up out of nowhere, car after car.  They're fucking piling out, and you just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  You end up in a position where you have no other choice.  You just have to.  You know, if it's me or them, that ain't a choice.  God, I'm going to have to put the game in.  Yeah, it's really good.  Not good for my OCD, though.  I don't think that's entertaining, to start shooting people.  That's not a good message to send.  You'd rather back into pools.  Yeah, but that was an accident.  But it did show the dangers of unsafe driving.  Yes, it did. 
[01:42:00]  I was trying to escape the police, and instead of firing at them, I did the responsible thing,  which was drive off the road and land at a jet ski rental place in the water,  and wait for the cops to just drive by on the road.  Drive by, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because why would they check the jet skis for a car in the water?  Yeah.  I also went to the house, you know, my crib.  I went to my crib, and I have the option, of course, to change clothes.  What did I do?  Changed right into a black hoodie.  Just because I wanted to wear one.  I went to the barber shop. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, you did, yeah.  My black guy, I got him a mini afro and a beard like Rick Ross with a mini afro.  Yeah, I didn't do it, and my partner keeps telling me what a fucking punk-ass nigga hair do I got.  And I look like shit, and I'm not getting any fucking bitches.  So I got to go to the bar.  I got to get to the barber shop myself.  The barber shop.  But, man, it's a lot of fun.  It is a lot of fun.  Fuck yeah.  Looks great.  So many different options.  I spent time just driving around in that, like, out of the country out there, and there's fucking, like, hillbillies living there. 
[01:43:00]  I fell off, kind of a, drove down a cliff thing, and I ended up crashing into the front of a house.  Whoops.  And there was somebody on the porch, and I fucking killed him.  And the whole family comes out to kill you.  So you haven't played as the white guy yet?  No, I've just been playing as the black guy.  So you haven't seen Danny Tamburelli?  Oh, no, I saw it at the very beginning.  Your first kind of training mission, you see him, where he's buying the car, and it's totally Danny Tamburelli.  He is all over it.  He's got such a big part. 
[01:43:30]  What a huge part.  Yeah.  And he's the dopey little fucking shithead brat kid of the crime boss guy.  Yeah.  It's fucking great.  Fun, fun, fuck game.  I love it.  This is Rohan Dawkins.  He would go to GameStop on Lincoln Boulevard every week, give them $10 from his Home Depot paycheck.  Finally, Tuesday, he saved enough to get the new game.  He bought it.  But police say he was followed into the parking lot by the husband and wife, where they robbed him right there and took the game. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, no.  I didn't know who won.  I don't want to deny it.  Oh, no.  Basically.  This is how hot this game is.  Oh, my God.  Probably should have gave it a little bit of a setup.  Oh, my God.  He's got a mentally challenged man, and he had his game stolen.  Can I say the...  Yeah, of course.  They fucking stole a retarded guy's fucking video?  Yes.  Because look at them.  Can we just play the video?  Yes, please.  Because look at them.  Of course they did.  That was being predatory or savages.  News Channel 5.  ...off because this mentally challenged man saved up for weeks to buy the game. 
[01:44:30]  He barely got out of the store into the parking lot when police say this guy shows up, snatches the game away, and then his wife gets involved and starts punching and kicking the mentally challenged man.  Take a look at the video.  This is Rohan Dawkins.  He would go to GameStop on Lincoln Boulevard every week, give them $10 from his Home Depot paycheck.  Oh, he works.  Finally, Tuesday, he saved enough to get the new game.  He bought it, but police say he was followed into the parking lot by the husband and wife. 
[01:45:00]  Where they robbed him right there and took the game.  I didn't know who won.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Me and me.  It wasn't nice that they did that to him and it hurt him.  Big picture, it's a $150 game, but big picture, I'm sure, to him, it was a very big deal.  It's a very anticipated game.  What a fucking animal. 
[01:45:30]  How do you beat a guy up like that?  Both of them.  The guy robbed him and then the girl started punching.  No, I say the punching is the worst.  And the women are worse than the fucking men in a lot of instances I see this.  They will fucking punch people.  Like, there is such a problem in the black community with fucking women that just are fucking unbelievably uncivilized.  I hate it.  I see it too much.  Stop trying to argue about it with me, too.  I'm right! 
[01:46:00]  Right of center.  Well, any more left to this?  More importantly, I've never seen a black mentally challenged person before.  Very rare.  You've never worked with Keith Robinson?  Why is that rare?  I don't know.  I'm not even joking.  You don't see many.  Not as many.  I don't know why.  Well, you've got to assume, again, 10% of the population.  Right, right, right.  You're not going to, you know.  Right.  But you still think you'd see them more often.  I don't think I've seen that many.  Also, can we pull audio from other channels yet? 
[01:46:30]  Really depends.  R. Klockhoff or something on Twitter writes, guys on EW, that would be Entertainment Weekly, I guess.  That's right.  We're talking about ONA around 8 a.m.  Hosts thought ONA were laughing at him when he was walking by studio.  Oh, boy.  Exactly.  Yeah, I wouldn't even.  I could not tell.  Exactly.  Wait, what did he talk about?  One of the hosts, I guess, walked by our studio.  And he's so paranoid, he thought we were laughing at him. 
[01:47:00]  You should laugh at him.  Who is he?  Wow, E-Rock.  E-Rock's picking on him.  E-Rock's right.  What happened?  He said that where?  On their channel.  Oh, on the air.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, did he say it?  We got spies.  E-Rock, why did he, why, why, why, why?  Wow!  Oh, God.  Metallica.  What the fuck happened?  Why did that pop up?  I went to SiriusXM's website and it started shouting,  Enter Sandman at me. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  God, that's very intrusive.  Wow.  We're all excited to see Metallica tomorrow night at the Apollo Theater.  Well, I'm glad they think that language is appropriate.  If we get our tickets, because I can't stick around to get my tickets,  because I've got to get my young son to school.  I can't either.  So hopefully someone can pick up my tickets for me.  Someone's got to pick up my tickets.  E-Rock, how come you don't like the guy?  Yeah, let's go back to E-Rock, who's never opinionated.  No.  And I mean that.  You've got to see this guy's profile.  I can't really see it.  We're trying to get a photo.  No.  Sal is getting involved. 
[01:48:00]  Why, Sal?  Go ahead.  I don't like the guy either.  Yeah.  Why?  He's creepy looking.  His chin sticks out way too far from his face.  Well, your belly...  You know the me, myself, and Irene?  I get it.  Yeah.  I want to be on the same page with E-Rock right now.  What?  Jim Carrey gets the plastic surgery with the chin.  And that's exactly...  He's got that ass chin, this guy.  Is he fat or skinny?  I don't even know who he is.  He's like Paul and Mikey.  I have no idea who this guy is, and he thinks we're laughing at him.  Now, how was he saying that? 
[01:48:30]  Was he saying it nasty, or just like they were laughing?  You know, what was his tone when he said it?  I would like to hear it.  Yeah, it might not be anything.  Can we get the audio?  I can try.  Sal's running down the wall.  Oh, Sal's running.  Sal has a very...  Quite a masculine gait, if I may.  No, no.  Must have heard there was a full glory hole with no takers in the bathroom.  Jesus.  See, he's going to go suck a dick.  I understand.  All right.  Oh, Kenny's got info.  Kenny.  Kenny knows what's going on in the hallway. 
[01:49:00]  Kenny knows everything.  He does know.  Those people aren't very cordial.  They're not, right?  That's the guy?  I've never seen that guy in my life.  I've never seen him.  I'm going to tell you, his name's Dalton Ross, and he couldn't be a nicer guy.  He doesn't say good morning or hello.  Sam.  I've never seen the guy.  I talk to him fairly often.  Sam's building a bridge.  I don't know if I've ever seen...  I wouldn't recognize that guy if he approached me in the street.  We weren't laughing at you.  I've never seen you before.  Because he's being attacked right now for possibly saying that we might have been laughing at him. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  We're not attacking him.  I'm just saying...  Iraq and Sal just described it.  Well, Iraq and Sal.  But then again, Iraq, Sal, and Kenny don't like him, and Sam likes him, that means he's  probably not a great guy.  So what's wrong with this picture, Sam?  He wants the gig, so he's got to be nicey-nice to the people over there.  Because there you go.  Sam's sucking up the Pete Dominick now so he can get on that show.  That's right.  Sam wants to be anywhere but here.  He's just not happy with this arrangement.  They're judging him based solely on appearance, which means they haven't said one word to 
[01:50:00]  him.  No.  They don't say hello in the morning.  They walk around the long way to avoid the studio.  Why would they think that we'd be hostile?  Where would they get that impression from?  I mentioned to their boss that they're not friendly in the morning.  Hey, boss.  Yeah.  You tattletailed.  No, no.  I'm friends with the guy.  Oh, God.  Because I said, what's up with those people?  They don't even say hello in the morning.  Oh, boy.  And it was told to me that they're intimidated. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, all right.  See, that's what I just said.  Yeah, but they're trying.  They probably don't want us to be mean to them.  But that show's not going to last long anyway because their phones never ring.  How do you know their phones never ring?  We can see it from the booth.  Kenny is just a nosy body.  I'm observing.  Or that.  Around 8, they said.  Most channels, most of these shows they could turn off and no one would care.  No one would really know.  Hey, kid.  You know that clown that just kind of is all creepy and shit and he stands there? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock, could you just go to their studio and just stand outside their studio and just stare  at them for one minute and then just walk away?  60 seconds.  Please?  Okay.  All right, go, Sam.  Go with him.  Yeah, you got to.  Go with him.  Just stare at them for one minute and then just walk away.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  What are you pausing, Sam?  I'm going to make problems.  Yeah.  Are you worried about problems? 
[01:51:30]  No, I'm not worried at all.  No.  I just know it's going to make problems.  Because they're going to say like this.  Dude, if we get past the Troy Kwan situation.  Come on.  Who?  The name that shall not be mentioned.  This is going to be all over now.  There's been an elephant showing up outside of studios.  Is he doing it, Kenny?  Yeah, they're in the hallway.  Is E-Rock just staring at them?  Yeah.  For one minute?  Yeah.  And what are they doing?  Can you see them?  No, I can see Eric, but I can't see.  They're just continuing the show right now, but Eric is just creepily sad. 
[01:52:00]  Is the girl pretty who works there?  What was that?  She's cute, right?  The girl?  Yeah, the host she is.  I think I've seen her.  How have I not seen any of those people?  We don't know any of those people.  I've probably seen her.  I saw her walking towards us.  What's her name?  What's this little tomato's name?  I'm telling you, they take the long way around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've got a reputation.  It's amazing the reputation.  It's like, we're the fucking nicest saps in the building if we like you.  We really are nice people.  If you're nice to us, we're nice to you.  Pussies, we are.  We don't take shots at anyone, man.  You're friends with all the girls at the morning mashup?  Aw, all the ladies. 
[01:52:30]  All the gals?  Yeah, we like them.  Colvino and Rich.  Yeah.  Colvino and Rich.  She is a Survivor winner and TV host Jenna Moresca.  Jenna Moresca.  I've heard of her.  Which one is she?  Did she have the curly hair?  She's got, like, straight hair.  I know.  Sam's coming back in.  Iraq is back in there.  Was it uncomfortable?  Now we've got to repeat this.  We've got to wait now about, I don't know, an hour.  Five minutes.  It was so creepy.  Yeah, why?  Was it uncomfortable?  Because Iraq positioned himself in a way to make sure that Dalton could see him. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  Which meant he had to go into, like, an awkward corner where nobody would just stand.  He wouldn't just stand there.  Right.  And so he stood there, and he just put his arms in front of him.  Right.  And just didn't smile, didn't frown, didn't look menacing, just stared.  Stared.  For a full minute.  And he said, the whole time Dalton was like, all of them in the studio actually were looking  at their papers, like, they'd look up for a second, and they'd catch E-Rock's eyes, and  then look away again real quick. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, very uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable.  When do we do it again?  Wait about an hour?  Yeah.  You've got to wait.  I think we kind of forced a break really fast over there.  Oh, they went to break?  Are they going to complain now?  You got them talking about us?  No, they didn't say a word, but...  No, I mean, from me.  We came back in, we're listening on the delay.  They're like, oh, let's just go to break.  Oh, really?  All right, can we go back to the story of the black mentally challenged guy? 
[01:54:00]  Sam's got to find the bit, or the little part.  Yeah, you tell me, because I'm listening in one ear to their show at 8 o'clock.  In your rear?  No, just ear.  Your rear?  Ear, I said.  Oh.  Yep, you're asshole, right?  Oh, Jesus, Chip.  Let's finish the news story on the GTA V that was ripped from the mentally challenged  guy's hands by these two animals.  Oh, okay.  And then he was punched about.  Poor feller.  Because it wasn't bad enough, you'd take his shit, now you've got to punch him about.  Well, you've always got to get violent.  You've got to get a few shots in.  Oh, God.  Really make it hurt. 
[01:54:30]  Behave.  Arrested just hours ago are Tommy Davis and his wife Adele Jones, charged with strong-armed  robbery and then selling the game to someone else.  Police say they offered to buy Rohan a new game when they were arrested today, but frankly,  it was just too late then.  The sad thing is Rohan right now still does not have that video game.  The police telling us that that couple sold it to someone else, and they still haven't  been able to track it down.  Live in Delray Beach, Brian Enten.  How about you buying my fucking game? 
[01:55:00]  Where's Delray Beach?  Oh, Florida.  Get him a GTA 1.  I believe.  Yeah.  We'll notice.  Down there for a lot of hell.  I can get him fucking Final Fantasy 2.  It won't matter.  Like, oh, this is great.  Love this game.  They just lived the game.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  They just lived the game.  Yeah, right?  How come you want to go play a game, but you lived the game?  That's kind of cool to live the game.  Hey, look at that.  Speaking of video games.  Yes.  Any big Super Mario fans?  Zelda fans? 
[01:55:30]  E?  Sexman.  I know it's E-Rock.  That's why I'm looking at the screen right now.  He's sexy, and he knows it.  Sexman.  That's ludicrous.  E-Rock, you've got to be bummed today.  It is a sad time.  The ex-Nintendo president, developer of Super Mario slash Zelda, dies of pneumonia.  Oh, no.  13th richest man in Japan.  13?  Who beats him out?  In Japan?  In Japan he's only the 13th? 
[01:56:00]  Or in the world?  No, in Japan.  Again, he was worth 2.1...  Bill?  Bill.  Billion.  That's a lot of yen.  How old was he?  Like 32.  Oh, I would have thought older.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  It was 90, right?  Something like that?  Oh.  89?  90?  I hope so with that kind of money.  You don't want somebody dying young with a fucking $2 billion.  Yes.  Only the good die young.  Jobs fucking refusing, trying the holistic shit.  Go get the fucking radiation zapped into you. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  He had so much money, he turned down all the retirement benefits and pension that the company  was going to give him.  Oh, yeah.  Big whoop.  Oh, that's a nice guy.  Yeah, exactly.  After he raised their coiffers.  Whatever it's called.  You are a very honorable thing to do.  I think I might have something here.  Oh, okay.  He said she was pointing at his thyroid.  Hercephagos.  What you got?  He wasn't pointing at his head. 
[01:57:00]  Or his wallet.  That's just being a dumb and broke.  It's not even my fault.  I wish you had a disease.  Stupid as well.  I wish I had something.  It broke.  I don't know.  That's not cool.  What did you find?  Yeah.  Anyway.  Oh.  Dalton said, I have to get something off my chest.  Dalton from fucking Entertainment Weekly.  Oh, I thought it was...  Can we play it on our show?  Let's just play it. 
[01:57:30]  Let's play it.  Where is this shit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's play it.  I really got to.  Happens every day.  Every damn day.  All right.  I'm walking here to the office.  Uh-oh.  And I walk by...  I'll even tell you the block.  I'll even tell you the corner.  I'm talking north, east corner...  It's very specific.  Very specific.  48th Street and 7th Avenue.  Okay?  All right.  Every single morning at about...  645, 650 a.m. 
[01:58:00]  Somewhere in there.  I'm picturing this block.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I'm right there.  There's a guy on the corner.  Yep.  He's there every morning.  And he has like a little stand with a little black box.  I know exactly what you're going to say.  He did it to me yesterday.  He's the homeless guy.  He does it to me every single damn day.  Explain what he does.  He goes, hey, big fella.  Can't you help the kids?  Can you help the kids, big fella?  Like the homeless.  He changed.  Sometimes it's the kids.  Sometimes it's the homeless.  Keep in mind.  This is like 6 a.m.  Yes.  So I'm unclear whether it's homeless kids. 
[01:58:30]  Or sometimes it's just kids.  And sometimes it's homeless or what.  It might be.  And every day I just sort of walk by him and say, not today.  Or I sort of nod.  Or I just ignore him or whatever.  But every morning he keeps hitting me up.  He's persistent.  I give him points for that.  But here's why I keep ignoring this guy.  Maybe he's talking about Miley.  Because there is literally no signage whatsoever for where this money is going.  It is the sketchiest.  It's a black box.  It's literally a little black box.  He doesn't even bother to put a name of an organization or anything. 
[01:59:00]  You're right, by the way.  I've seen these guys.  And I fucking shoot him a nasty fucking look.  And he's there.  I'm like, this cannot be real.  This guy.  You're lying.  Pretty lady.  Pretty lady.  As I was crossing the street.  And I was like, crap, there he is.  So I started doing a diagonal jaywalk across the street.  Trying to get away from his corner of the block.  English Fez?  Who was that guy?  He's like, you got any change?  And I was like, I don't have anything.  I actually don't have anything.  He's like, we take credit cards.  Come on.  It's too early for this.  He is insistent and persistent. 
[01:59:30]  And because it's early morning here in New York City, there's not many people out.  He can do that.  He can yell you down.  And the other day, usually I just say, he just lets me go and he goes on to the next guy.  But then yesterday, then he said, open your heart, big fella.  And then I literally almost was like, give me all the information you have on this organization.  I'm going to put a tail on you.  Follow you and this black box.  See where this money is going.  Sexy.  Because I know it's not going to kids or homeless.  He's not talking about us.  He's Bank of America. 
[02:00:00]  His account.  That's where it's going.  Okay.  So that's the first thing.  Here's the second thing.  I got to get off my chest.  Oh, boy.  So I come into Sirius XM every morning.  Okay.  Here it is.  Because I'm a nerd, I usually make my lunch.  And as we've established, I eat like a five-year-old.  Like literally peanut butter and jelly.  Lucky you.  It's pathetic.  That's the thing I have up there.  It's pathetic.  So I drop that off in the Sirius XM fridge.  Okay.  Grab myself an orange juice.  Okay.  That's my attempt to stay healthy.  I love that there's free juice here.  Got the free juice.  Already put it down.  Tropicana 100%.  Felt good.  So I get the juice at the fridge. 
[02:00:30]  Then I walk down the long corner to come here.  As you walk down that corner, Opie and Anthony Studios in front of you, right?  So they're there.  And I've noticed every once in a while, they all seem to turn around and look at me and  start laughing while they're on the air.  It makes me very self-conscious.  I don't like this at all.  You should go back and listen to them on demand and see what they're saying.  Well, I thought about doing that.  I'm like, I don't like this at all.  I'm exposed.  They've got a view.  They're looking at me.  Why are they laughing at me?  So then again this morning, I noticed that they turn and they're laughing. 
[02:01:00]  I'm like, these mother, what is going on?  They're not looking at me.  But then I noticed, wait a minute.  All this time that I thought they were looking at me and laughing at me, there's actually some TV monitors  they have there.  So I realized, no, no, no.  They're not watching me.  They're watching, you know, whatever, the Today Show or whatever.  And they're making fun of Matt Lauer.  It's not me at all.  Does that actually make you a little upset?  Well, this is just it.  Was it me being so self-conscious and insecure that made me think they were talking about  me?  Or was it my ego that makes me think they're talking about me? 
[02:01:30]  I don't know.  But you see how this is why we have to hear stuff?  Yes.  Because the listener sent something in.  Yeah, I don't mind this guy at all, actually.  No, it's fine.  And by the way, here's the beauty.  This break wasn't bad at all.  The beauty of him is that they chose those voices over Sam.  That's right.  Holy shit.  They thought Sam.  Sam, your voice wasn't that good.  They liked your content, but your voice wasn't good.  Oh, man.  See, that wasn't a bad break at all.  No, it was fine.  No, I would talk about the fucking dumb black guys that are on the corner trying to fucking 
[02:02:00]  steal money from the tourists.  Which is why it's funny that you guys held judgment until you listened to the clip.  I said he was a nice guy, but now in the record books, Club Soda Kenny, E-Rock, and Sal  have shitted on them for no reason.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, he's totally fine.  And he even admitted we weren't laughing at him.  No.  Yeah, he is fine looking.  But next time he comes by, you do just have to point right at him.  Of course we do.  I'll point at him and laugh.  Yeah, then we should, like, throw something. 
[02:02:30]  No.  See, Chip, that doesn't work.  Now someone's saying that Conan is ripping off Jim Norton.  We got spies everywhere today.  He's kind of a barbarian with his physique.  And actually, you know what?  Sorry, Jimmy, sorry.  Actually, Mentality Mag is a great one to follow on Twitter.  Yeah.  So he might be onto something.  Could you go to his Twitter?  Yes.  Conan O'Brien reviews Grand Theft Auto 5.  Conan stole Jimmy's clueless gamer bit.  I don't know if it's a bit. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, I don't know about that.  I don't see Conan stealing from it.  I like the trigger.  All right.  So now let's just kind of drive around, get a feel for it.  It's fantastic.  This is actually how I commute to work.  You can also steal any car.  If you see a car you like, you can jump out and then just steal it.  Oops.  Oh, nice.  Yep.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Now get yellow to get in the car. 
[02:03:30]  Nice.  There you go.  A little Mini Cooper.  It's crashing into another thing.  It is funny to watch.  Hey, Jim.  I'm going for a drink.  Dad.  Shit.  I'm in our boat going down the west.  Standing Tamborale.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah.  I wouldn't say it's a ripoff at all.  It's just fucking...  Anybody that plays that hasn't played, it's going to be funny.  I don't think it's a ripoff, but it does show you how funny that would have been if  we had a TV element.  If we actually had a visual element. 
[02:04:00]  Because Jimmy was hilarious.  We did something.  And now Conan gets a...  I mean, again, Conan is Conan.  I lifted up my camera and Laszlo gave me a look.  And out of respect for Laszlo, I didn't film.  Oh, because it wasn't out yet.  But too bad we couldn't have filmed that.  I should have filmed it and then told Laszlo, you know, you got my word, I won't put it  out until the game is out.  But can you imagine if we had the ability...  I saw the Look Laszlo game and I'm like, all right, cool.  He's really paranoid and nervous about shit getting out there.  But imagine if we had the ability to tape that knowing that we'd put it out once the 
[02:04:30]  game was out.  Yeah, it would have been great.  That thing would have done unbelievable.  Or even to make it look like that with the gameplay video and stuff actually in the video.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You take that.  I mean, like, from the TV, was this the audio over a split screen?  Do we still have an Xbox here?  I think so.  This is what we need.  So why don't we try it again?  Because we'd have to capture...  We don't have a method of capturing the gameplay.  Right.  We don't have any equipment we could make use for viral stuff.  But we could just film it.  Yeah.  I don't want to force it either.  Now it just feels like it's just a watch.  You're right.  It was funny, like, I enjoyed it. 
[02:05:00]  Crash into something, Jim.  Yeah.  That's what we'd be.  Okay, Jimmy.  That would just be really good at it.  Yeah.  Kick an ass.  Quite honestly, Conan did it, so...  And Conan did it already.  Yeah.  He did it.  We can't rip off Conan.  But it would seem like that.  You know what I mean?  People who aren't familiar with our show would say, oh, he's the only late night talk show  host that has never really had any interaction with us.  Yeah.  I would love to know what that's about someday.  He probably doesn't know anything about us.  Ah, he's got to know.  Yeah, he's from New York.  He's out of New York.  He's from Boston.  Doesn't have anyone on his show who cares. 
[02:05:30]  Nah, he's got to know, man.  Conan!  We've all been on Fallon, Leno, and Letterman, and a lot of our guys have been on all those  shows.  Maybe he's in it.  Something with Conan, man.  I just found out a buddy of mine was fucking head writers for Kimmel, this guy, Gary Greenberg,  who I've known for years.  Wow.  He's a very funny, quirky comic and author.  Right.  And it's like, all right, that's one reason Kimmel's stuff is so, like, you know what I mean?  It's like, you see, like, kind of a weird-thinking comic line behind it.  It's like, okay, that makes a lot of sense.  Conan, I think his head writer's a guy named Mike Sweeney, who is a fucking brilliant stand-up 
[02:06:00]  host here.  At least he was for a long time.  In New York.  Yeah, I haven't seen him in years, but he was really funny.  Wow, people are lining up for the iPhone.  What?  Not really.  I was here yesterday at the line.  They're lining up.  They just showed a video, Sam.  Wait, when's the new one coming out?  Today.  The new iPhone, today.  Yes.  See?  iPhones.  That's how much I could give a flying fuck these days.  Oh, that's nice talk. 
[02:06:30]  I could give a flying fuck.  Oh, that's nice talk.  All the people online for it yesterday that were, like, sleeping overnight and everything,  all of them sponsored.  Yeah.  All of them were there last year, too.  What about?  They're not real.  You know what?  How much did they charge?  She wasn't there.  Companies ruin everything.  They do.  Yeah.  Because it was a thing to wait online, and then they have to get their fucking hands  involved.  Like, oh, well, let's sponsor this guy.  And it just takes away from the whole thing.  Of course, Greg Packer is there, as always. 
[02:07:00]  Is he?  Yeah.  How much did he get paid to do that?  I don't know.  But there was some kid who was there for, like, 14 days.  And what?  But he has a shirt on.  Of course.  They all have shirts on.  So he wasn't going to be there 14 days.  No, for the phone.  He wasn't there for the phone.  He was there for the publicity.  Right.  It's a company that said, look, it's probably an intern or something that said, hey, you're going  to wear a shirt for 14 days, the media is going to pick up on this and eventually talk  to you.  And not only is it, like, they're getting one guy to wear a shirt, but they're now blocking  off.  There's, like, the first six people in line are all wearing the same shirt. 
[02:07:30]  And then the next six people in line are wearing a different shirt.  And it's, like, it wasn't even worth it.  And those guys would never be waiting online if they weren't.  It's not a thing.  It's not a good thing.  It's some marketing thing.  They were there last year.  They got the phone last year.  Right.  And they were sponsored last year, too.  So, you think the phone will be sold out, of course, because Apple won't ship it?  That's another thing Apple does.  Stop with the fucking predictable, oh, we don't have enough.  Sorry.  Yeah, we just underestimated.  Yeah, yeah.  They want to make a buzz about it instead of serving their fucking customers.  Oh, we underestimated how hot this phone would be. 
[02:08:00]  Did you have fucking 10 years running?  So, you're going to have to wait 10 days now.  Because in the studio, you...  It's all garbage.  Yeah, you fucking cronut fucking ideology.  There are two Apple fanboy queers in this room...  Yeah, yeah.  ...who did not know the phone was coming out today.  Yep.  Like, Apple is very slowly losing certain people because of these fucking douchey ladders.  I'm listening to Ope Talk at the Notebook, and I'm like, you know what?  Maybe that would be a fucking fun phone to try...  Oh, the Note.  It's big, though.  Why not?  But I was out with my old pal, Buzzy, who I've known since I was 18, and... 
[02:08:30]  Oh.  God, that Note looks great.  But it's like something to think about.  And I go, can I have it for a second?  I want to see if it just fits in a pocket nice.  Because in the end, that's all you care.  That's all you care about.  If you can put it in a pocket nice.  The online store is already estimating 7 to 10 days before they can ship the new iPhone.  I don't know.  You know, we underestimated the demand for this thing.  What fucking cunts?  Why can't you ship it faster?  They're really...  Bullshit.  That company, mark my word, is going down, down, down. 
[02:09:00]  What about the China deal?  I'm so mad.  Even with the China deal, I'm starting to think.  I'm not saying anything outrageous, but I'm telling you, they're now going to fuck up everything.  They are just...  Again, they keep doing the same shit that worked a few years ago.  Thank you.  All that shit did work.  But it's not working anymore.  Yeah, keep cock-teasing the technology, dummies.  Their stock almost split, fell in half when this fucking twat Tim Cook took over.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  That's a big...  All right, stock goes up and down.  Huge drop.  Seven-something down to almost 390 again?  They got to reinvent themselves a little bit.  Fucking assholes.  A little bit, a little bit.  What's on this new phone?  The fingerprint thing is pretty cool.  The fingerprint password.  The processor in it is crazy.  It's as powerful as the computer.  It's one they should have had this time if they didn't.  But the fingerprint thing is going to be on everything within probably two years.  Yeah, easily.  It's probably going to be the way you start your own damn car.  So now your fingerprint thing.  It's like, all right, I'm going to chat. 
[02:10:00]  I'm going to fucking go to Facebook.  Right.  And instead of logging in, fingerprint.  Right.  That's the name of the game here.  Eventually.  Eventually.  Right now it's just to unlock the phone.  Right now it's just to unlock the phone.  Who gives a shit?  Will that be easier?  That'll be everyone's password.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But again, is that easier or harder?  I guess it's harder to steal.  But what if you have a picture of somebody's...  Will people be able to get a graphic image of your fingerprint?  No, you have to actually touch the physical phone.  But there'll always be a workaround.  It's not a scan.  But somebody will figure it out. 
[02:10:30]  There's always a workaround.  Always.  But the fingerprint's going to be pretty damn tough.  Here's what's going to happen now.  Someone's going to punch in your face.  Nice.  Take your iPhone.  Nip your thumb off.  True.  And run away with it.  And then fucking...  So there's going to be a lot of people walking around without thumbs.  Thumbless people.  Absolutely.  Just so they could unlock the phone and change everything.  It might be a combination of your fingers.  You could go like...  Now, okay.  Then take the fucking hand.  Take all your hands and try everyone.  Plink, plink, plink, plink.  And there's also a much better camera on it. 
[02:11:00]  Of course.  One they could have put here too.  But again, make another lateral movement instead of inventing something.  A camera that can fully take advantage of the new camera's software.  4K?  Because I hear 4K.  No, there's trees.  What?  Oh.  I'm trying to upgrade for the new millennium.  Uber racism.  4K.  4K.  I just got a delicious...  KKKK.  I just got a delicious treat.  I got to share with everyone.  Oh, no.  Had a little something going on in my mouth. 
[02:11:30]  So I went for the pick and just peeled an entire layer of skin out of my mouth.  God damn it.  Why?  Just a nice, wonderful treat that came out of nowhere.  You're like Brundle Hughes.  You're just like peeling pieces off of yourself.  No, it wasn't like...  No.  Your athlete's foot.  No, no pain or any of that shit.  It was just...  A little skin was hanging and I went for the peel and it just peeled the whole bunch of stuff right off.  I don't know.  It just, to me, gives me the heebie-jeebies.  It's those wonderful surprise... 
[02:12:00]  Those little...  It's the small moments.  It's the small moments in life.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Now you're going to try to...  Do you think you're getting just a little something and just...  You're going to try to recapture the moment and fucking...  Like a sheet of skin.  A fucking gash.  A sheet of skin just came off.  Oh.  Yuck.  And then it dislodged cleanly all night.  Why is that good?  Then I swallowed it.  Oh, yuck.  Why did you eat it?  I had a bit knee to punchline.  It wasn't that great. 
[02:12:30]  I needed to punch it up a little bit.  For the people that really are concerned, and I know they care, I did not eat the pizza last night.  Thank you.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, they care.  Yeah, I've heard.  Fruit loops.  I'm tweeting about it all the time.  No, last night...  Lucky charms.  Last night, I finally was able to do it.  I went to Yasuda, which is this wonderful sushi joint in New York City that Anthony Bourdain turned me on.  What's it called?  Personally.  Yasuda.  You like it?  It fits me pretty good, huh?  Fuck.  I thought you actually cared.  And then I came home. 
[02:13:00]  I got a fucking million dollar settlement afterwards.  A lawsuit.  Oh, call me a...  Yasuda?  Yeah, I did.  You tickle me.  And then I got home around 10 o'clock.  Had a couple beers with my old pal.  Uh-oh.  Catching up.  Tying one on.  Not really.  I was telling you about that earlier.  I'm just not into drinking anymore.  Nah.  A few beers here and there, maybe, but...  Like, we went and got wine, a glass of wine, and I'm sipping it, and I'm like, yeah, I don't like wine anymore. 
[02:13:30]  No.  And I used to love it.  Anyway, then I get home, and there's two fucking boxes of pizza right on the kitchen counter.  Everyone's asleep.  Oh, man.  It's 10 o'clock, and I'm like, here you go.  Just go to bed.  Just one slice.  Just go to bed.  Yeah, let's work it off tomorrow.  And then I tweeted a picture that just said, you know, don't do it.  Go to bed.  Go to bed.  And there were a lot of concerned people out there, and also a lot of assholes.  Were people supportive?  They just do it. 
[02:14:00]  No, of course not.  Of course they weren't.  Do you ask your wife why she's getting pizza?  Like, do you say, like, you can't do this?  You can't order a pizza.  Order yourself a slice or order a few and then throw it down the dumpster.  It's not like we have pizza every day in the house, but it was sitting there tempting me.  It tasked me.  It certainly did.  But for the people that really are following along, I just went to bed.  Although I did go in the cabinet, and I just had to see if it was still there. 
[02:14:30]  What?  The Lucky Charms?  The Lucky Charms.  I just had to see if there was a box of Lucky Charms there.  You really like them Lucky Charms?  Dude, I'm like a fucking drug addict.  I start shaking.  I'm like, just go to bed.  They are tasty.  They're so good.  There's nothing better than eating right before you go to bed.  They're pretty goddamn good when you get just that first giant spoonful where you've got to make the sound.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  There's another cereal that I can't help but eat. 
[02:15:00]  Sugar pops.  Cap'n Cun.  Oh, we're going to guess?  S'mores.  Frosted Flakes.  What would be the other cereal?  Coffee.  Fruity Pebbles.  Special K.  Fruity Pebbles is nice.  Cheerios.  Cheerios.  Kicks.  Kicks.  This is a popular one.  Honeycomb.  You went to the Honeycomb hideout.  This is a pop culture one.  Cinnamon Toast Cry.  Hala!  Hala!  Yeah!  See that? 
[02:15:30]  CTC.  That's my second go-to.  So good.  Is that healthier?  No.  Fuck no.  It's covered in sugar.  But cinnamon is not like sugar.  The sugar part is.  Damn it.  It's not just cinnamon.  Yeah, cinnamon really does suck without the sugar part.  Horrible.  It really does.  And Cinnamon Toast Crunch is basically sugar with a dash of cinnamon.  Oh, God, do I love it.  Yeah.  That's my second go-to.  It is lovely.  You like that too, Jimmy?  Of course.  You don't like shredded wheat?  Cinnamon Toast Crunch is amazing.  Or Wheaties.  I mean, you drink the fucking milk afterwards, and you kiss a girl. 
[02:16:00]  And you get dry milk breath.  Do you buy milk at Jubilee?  I only buy lactate, fat-free milk, and that's where I get it.  Their milk is leaky.  What?  This is way too local.  Oh, is it that fucking...  Our supermarket has leaky milk.  On the rack, you pick it up, and it's just fucking sitting in a puddle of milk.  You see that?  Yeah.  So then I make sure that doesn't happen when I grab mine, and then I take it home, and  guess what?  I got the milky, leaky spot in the fucking kitchen.  What's going on?  So we constantly have to pour our stupid milk into pitchers. 
[02:16:30]  I don't know what...  Yeah, what is going on?  A pitcher.  Do they got to update the milk carton?  Is it getting too soggy or something?  I don't know.  It's probably sweating on the outside.  I don't know actually what I mean.  No, this is actual milk.  And it's a big pile.  The fucking gorilla is transporting it.  Like my old TV?  Rolling it on the floor.  Like my old TV?  Yeah, yeah.  Like your TV rolling the milk in.  See, I never claimed to be an actual tough guy, because when it comes right down to it,  I'm a fucking pussy.  These guys rolled in a $500 at the time TV into my old brownstone. 
[02:17:00]  Big old tube television.  It weighed, you know, in all fairness, about 200 to 300 pounds.  Old school.  And this is not that long ago.  Six, seven years ago.  Yeah.  And these guys, these animals, rolled my TV into my house, and I didn't say a fucking word.  I just accepted that's how it was going to be delivered.  I needed three people to move my 38-inch.  I had a 38-inch tube television. 
[02:17:30]  With the back that fucking went out five feet and shit.  And it took three people.  One on each corner of the front, and one holding the back thing that came off.  Because it was so heavy.  And then, me and Vinny hung the 90...  Vinny and I!  Me and Vinny hung the 90-inch television.  And really, it was nothing.  What are the new TVs?  I saw it when I was in L.A.  There's a new...  Because 1080 is the one now.  This is 4K?  4K, motherfucker.  I want to get one of those. 
[02:18:00]  I'm waiting for 4K.  Oh, you said 4K?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I want to get a 3D projector for the theater.  I'm upgrading to 3D projector.  And 4K is good for...  And I'm getting 4K.  4K is good for 3D, right?  Is it already 3D already?  Oh, yeah.  You're getting 4,000 pixels.  Instead of 1080p.  Me and my manager were talking.  He said, you should sell your old TV.  I'm like, dude, it's a fucking 7-year-old plasma.  The picture's beautiful, but it's not as good as a 4K picture. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  I'll give you $30 for it.  It looks astounding.  Yeah, I'll fucking take it.  Speaking of 3D, my buddy last night was telling me that they're re-releasing, I guess, The Wizard of Oz in 3D?  In 3D.  I didn't know about this until they told me last night.  But they're only doing it for a week or two?  Gays are thrilled.  But it was really tough to turn that movie into 3D?  Of course.  And they're only going to throw it out there on the IMAX for a week?  Yeah.  Well, then you know what they're going to do after that?  They'll put it on 3D Blu-ray. 
[02:19:00]  Ah!  And then they'll make their money that way.  It needed the money!  But fuck, man, if they'd spent all that time, I would love to go to an IMAX and see that  in 3D.  Yeah.  I saw Jurassic Park.  It was okay in 3D.  It's got to be shot in 3D for it to work.  That's true.  You need the right fucking original.  You have to.  I don't know.  I think The Wizard of Oz in 3D would be kick-ass.  Yeah, maybe they can do something cool with it.  I wish my kid was a little older.  They're remaking that with fucking Gwyneth Paltrow? 
[02:19:30]  You should have picked a different actress.  I know I should have.  I couldn't think of anyone.  That would look ridiculous.  Yes, she's playing.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  She's playing Toto.  Toto.  We should take a break because we've got a very special guest outside the studio.  Yeah.  Oh, who is it?  I'm actually surprised we were able to pull this off.  It's pretty amazing.  Oh.  We'll just leave it at that.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  You'll be there at this show.  On Sirius X.  Sirius XM. 
[02:20:00]  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  I don't want to come back down from this cloud.  Taking me all this time.  Bush.  Bush was pretty epic in those 90s.  Oh, yeah.  And it's a ring.  I don't think they got enough credit for their songs. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah?  Because the girls would just...  Yeah.  Remember we saw Bush?  Oh, my God.  Somewhere up there in the Boston area.  Worcester Centrum, I think.  Was it?  Yeah.  And I was a big Bush fan back then.  I really liked their songs a lot.  And they had a lot of hits.  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, this is going to be...  We got to go to a lot of concerts, but that one I was really looking forward to.  And I remember sitting on the side of the stage, like in the audience, but on the side. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty close to the stage.  And you were sitting right next to me.  I think we brought our girls at the time.  And I was so pissed off because the girls...  Oh, you'd hear.  ...just were screaming the whole time because he's a sexy devil, I guess.  And I was thinking to myself, fuck.  It's all you'd hear.  I really want to hear these guys.  It didn't matter how well they played because these girls weren't paying attention to anything.  No, they just wanted Gavin.  I don't know.  I just feel like they should have got a little more credit for their music than they did in 
[02:21:30]  the end.  They had signs.  All the girls were holding signs about how they loved Gavin.  Oh, God.  I want Gavin.  Anyway, we got a very special guest.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For the record, we never played the Billie Jean King, Bobby Riggs thing that we starred the  show off with.  Well, we'll assume...  Years later, they're saying Bobby Riggs had to pay off some debts.  So he purposely lost so some gamblers would make a few shekels. 
[02:22:00]  He trued a game.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Let's bring in our...  Oh, Troy is right outside.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Troy Kwan.  What if you're opening the door?  What?  We're getting to our special guest and then we just...  Troy!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's waving back though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.  That's fine.  Close the curtain.  Close the curtain.  We're not playing porn.  It's all fine.  It's all fine.  We're just bringing in a special guest.  We don't want to leave our guest waiting. 
[02:22:30]  Let's talk to him about his new tats.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's no big story.  He's gotten tats before.  It's really boring.  All right.  I love that Stalker Patty is talking, and everyone has their heads down, and they're  not paying attention, but it doesn't stop her.  She continues talking.  Well, she could do that in here now, too, because we'll all just not listen.  Our special guest.  Let's bring her in.  Stalker Patty.  It's Stalker Patty, ladies and gentlemen.  The most pathetic person we have met over the years.  Yeah.  But she doesn't think so.  And I love that about her.  Look at Patty.  Hi, Patty. 
[02:23:00]  Hi, Patty.  Hello.  We've known you for 18 years.  How's your lump?  Oh, getting there.  What happened?  Wait a minute.  It's gone?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I still got it.  I can still see it.  It's like over here.  Oh, my God.  Right on the Adam's apple.  Did they slit your throat?  If you had an Adam's apple.  Yeah, they did.  They slit your throat?  Well, yeah.  Deep enough.  They're going to get the thyroid.  Pant the thyroid out.  Oh, my God.  So what did they do?  They pulled out your thyroid gland?  Yeah, just half of it.  Half of it?  Half of it.  That had the lump on it. 
[02:23:30]  But it was benign.  You don't age.  You've...  Eight, ten.  But the thing is, they couldn't tell when it was still in there.  They had to take it out to find out it was benign.  So I got half of it.  Benign.  To find out it was benign.  When did you have that done?  June 5th.  Okay.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Only two months, three months ago.  You feel okay?  Yeah.  Patty.  I don't even need medications.  I'm throwing nothing so far because my blood results are fine.  They're all good over there.  How did you know you had the thyroid thing?  You felt a lump? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, well, the doctor was doing a routine exam and just found it, you know, by...  Because they feel your throat and he said, I feel something there.  Oh, boy.  That's how they found it.  Jesus.  Where's the scar?  He said, no way it's come.  Yeah.  Because she doesn't suck any dick.  Oh, I'm fine.  Oh, I'm fine.  I'll say.  I was going to say, Patty, we've known you for 18 years.  You don't age.  You've looked 60 for 18 years.  Yeah.  But you don't age.  Well, I kind of looked old for your age back in the day, but now you're looking good. 
[02:24:30]  You always looked old for your age.  Older than your age.  But you haven't, like...  She hasn't aged since then.  It's creepy.  Yeah, a state of complete fucking suspended animation.  You're as much a delight today as the day I met you.  Yes.  I could have recommended a good doctor to cut that out.  Elzar Cowie.  All right.  Oh, Patty.  Yes, the Los Sitos said they're going to help take out my thyroid lump.  My thyroid.  It took me to a field.  That was...  Could you talk afterwards? 
[02:25:00]  Well, I was hoarse for about two months, and then it went away.  That was so hoarse.  Were you getting married to Fez, or did they drop that bit?  Weren't you and Fez getting married at some point?  No, no, no.  It didn't work.  It wasn't meant to be.  You know.  We're happier being free.  Wait, how did that bit end, Sam?  Do you know?  How did that bit end?  Yeah, he's happy how he is.  I guess he's a gay man, but I'm not sure if he's had any gay sex or whatever.  I don't know.  Believe it or not.  He was going to marry Patty for the radio, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they were going to have to live together, I guess. 
[02:25:30]  I know when it comes to Fez, this is going to be tough to believe.  Right.  But I think it just kind of trickled out with no real payoff.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It just kind of...  Because to keep the bit going, you need one of the... you know, you need to talk about  it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh.  For the record, I was laughing at something else I saw.  I didn't hear what you said.  What? 
[02:26:00]  The guy from Entertainment Weekly Radio?  That was exactly it.  That was him?  No.  He was laughing, though, so I assumed it was him.  What happened?  Yeah, I was laughing at what you said about Fez.  I just didn't want to cop to it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Remember we were just talking about what we should put on the podcast next week?  Yes.  Joshua in Texas nailed it.  It has to be the best of Stalker Patty.  That's a good one.  Make it Stalker Patty-centric.  What are you going to do with the other 55 minutes?  Oh, shit, Patty.  Oh, shit.  No, he didn't.  You know, I don't know how to download the podcast. 
[02:26:30]  Can I do it through an app on my phone?  Yes.  What you got to do...  Sounds like a commercial.  Is you wet your fingers, and there's those things in the wall, and you gem your fingers  in there, and the podcast just shows up on your phone.  I'll take that advice.  Okay.  Yeah, I already figured out Pelt Walk Free, and I put that on my phone.  You just say stuff that no one cares about.  It's their life.  It's unbelievable.  It's been that way always.  What kind of phone do you have?  A jitterbug.  I have a Galaxy.  I got it for Christmas two years ago. 
[02:27:00]  Who gave it to you?  Oh.  A man?  A guy?  Oh.  A gentleman?  Did you earn it with your mouth?  I have an older foster brother in New Jersey, and he gave it to me for my birth.  Here it comes.  I never want a foster brother.  No.  For the people out there, I don't want a foster brother, and if I did, I wouldn't call him  my foster brother.  My foster brother.  That just puts you in a bad situation before you even have a relationship.  Isn't he just like your brother, sort of, that lived in the house, too, and was abused? 
[02:27:30]  But not for long.  Yeah.  Was he abused, too?  Did your foster father walk in on him when he was bathing?  Oh, I don't know.  He was nine years older than me.  They had their own lives, and they're that much older.  Oh, boy.  So did he get a little piece of you, too?  Like another adult.  Like your old dad?  Did he do anything?  No.  Oh.  No, that sucks.  Let me ask you, when you were laying on the couch, honestly, would you ever feel like  when you were laying on the couch, you didn't like him laying next to you and cuddling you?  That was kind of creepy.  Well, I don't know. 
[02:28:00]  At 11, 12, you kind of want to be by yourself.  That's true.  And he would lay behind you and just kind of cuddle close and fall asleep.  But when I think about it, you know, the person, you know, his sister in Massachusetts  didn't have a lot of space.  Well, I mean, I know, but there wasn't that little space.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  That's your very optimistic.  The fucking rod had to be pressed against your ass.  This was not an issue of geometry and space.  Yeah.  But you would kind of feel impressed against your backside.  You didn't like it, right?  Eh.  Kind of.  It's all right. 
[02:28:30]  Let's talk about finally, Patty.  Well, I wasn't comfortable, no.  Now, would he have pajama bottoms on?  Yeah, just PJs on, like, footsies or something.  Oh, I can't do this.  What would he have on?  He just had his regular pajamas on.  And he would hug you now.  Would he kiss your neck a little bit?  No, he didn't do that at all.  Was there a hatch?  Not at all, no.  Was there a little hatch on the back here?  No contact, no.  But you'd feel him against your buttocks through the pajamas, though.  I'm buttoned.  I'm buttoned, ass fucker.  Oops.  But would you feel him through the pajamas?  Not naked, though.  I mean, but through the pajamas.  You had to. 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Well, think about it.  Something twitching.  Twitching.  Well, he knows I didn't like his smell because he smoked, so I wasn't exactly comfortable with that.  You didn't like his breath, right?  Oh, boy.  His breath was awful?  Well, yeah, when you smoke, you smell all over.  So would he ever, when he would lay behind you, would he wrap his arms around you?  No.  He had to.  He had to.  I don't think so.  I don't remember that.  Where were his arms, then?  Yeah, wasn't he fucking put them over his head like he was?  Just like, like that, you know?  She put them by her face like he was sleeping, like every fucking, like it looked like the 
[02:29:30]  fucking poster the elephant man had in his room, a photo of a normal boy sleeping.  Was there any rubbing as he was trying to get comfortable?  Because, you know, there's not a lot of room on the couch.  You've got to find a spot.  You've got to kind of rub around a little bit and try to find a spot.  Did he ever take your hand and pull it back a little bit?  No.  Come on.  What are you lying for?  He never touched me.  You had the, you were like Streisand and nuts.  Whoa, you said he never touched me.  Hold on.  I caught that.  Oh, my.  He never touched me, meaning you touched him. 
[02:30:00]  No, he didn't do that.  Did he touch others?  He never touched me.  Were there stories of him touching others?  I don't know.  Okay.  Can we put you under hypnosis?  Oh, boy.  He said nothing really happened.  He didn't think anything, did he?  No, I want to put you under hypnosis.  I know it's kind of a hack bit, but...  Didn't we?  We did.  Yeah, you did.  That's how we got all this information.  Yeah, the hypnotist fell asleep.  I don't remember.  Yeah, it was really boring under...  Yeah.  It was very long and very boring, but we did manage to get this colonel final. 
[02:30:30]  Who was there that day that was so mad at us?  Somebody with ears.  Management.  We were spending a lot of attention on her than a comic or something.  Yeah, he was definitely a comedian.  Sounds like a treat.  Bobby?  Voss?  Joel McHale?  No, it's...  Richard Pryor?  The dude with the glasses.  Ari?  Does a lot of cartoon voices.  Dude with the glasses?  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:31:00]  Cartoon voices.  Older guy.  Help me out.  Colin Quinn?  No.  Ah, shit.  This is not good.  Oh.  Jimmy.  Boy, no help from Palton.  I think he's from San Francisco originally.  Fuck.  Is it Greg Proops?  Greg Proops.  For the win.  Eric Gera.  I think he might have been in that day, and we were so into the hypnosis thing with 
[02:31:30]  Patty, I think he didn't really get a lot of air time, and I think he was a bit frustrated  by that whole thing.  Oh, well.  It happens.  Sorry.  My apologies.  Patty, what happened to your cat?  Last we talked to you on the phone, you got a little postcard in the mail that you could  take your cat in for a free checkup, and we warned you at the time that that's going  to lead to something.  Yep.  That it was some kind of scam.  I never did go back to him.  Instead, I went to the vet around the corner for her shots. 
[02:32:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Did you go to him originally?  Well, the first time for the free checkup.  Right.  Okay.  Then why didn't you go back?  I didn't go back because he was trying to sell me other things, but I went to the vet  around the corner for only a quarter of the price.  He did another checkup, plus he gave his shots and everything, all for under $50.  And what did the other guy want?  $200.  $200.  $200.  And he said that, what, the cat needed something?  You were sick?  Yeah.  Effie was fine, because I asked the other vet, and he said, she's okay. 
[02:32:30]  She's fine.  What the fuck?  They were talking about you being fine.  You're fine.  No, Effie's fine.  Wow.  She's fine?  She's 11 years old, so, you know.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Oh, well.  You ought to just kind of fucking squish your head under a bike tire.  Oh, man.  So, that fucking vet, we were absolutely right, Patty, when we told you we was going to try  to rip you off.  I never went back to him.  See, we look after you.  You know that.  See?  We're your pals.  That's right.  What did she just do? 
[02:33:00]  I don't know.  How's work?  She was very happy that we said that.  It gave us a big smile.  I can get a little closer to home.  You're getting a transfer?  You're getting a transfer.  Yeah.  And where?  I've been in the same place for seven and a half years.  Starbucks, we're talking about, right?  Change of scenery.  Ah, change of scenery.  You know, I'm the only original employee.  You do realize you work for the one company where you're not going to get the change of  scenery because it's the exact same fucking coffee shop. 
[02:33:30]  Doesn't matter where you are.  No matter what city you go to.  Move across the country, it's the exact same scenery.  And all this stuff's going to be in the exact same place.  The same music.  They don't fuck around, man.  It's the same bananas.  Yeah.  You're going to be on Staten Island?  Yeah, I would like to be.  Did you put in for this transfer?  We're a car fare in half, you know.  Did you put in for the transfer?  Yeah, you already did.  That's already taken care of.  I'm just waiting now.  Oh.  And then when do you find out?  I don't know.  They're going to call me next week. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, boy.  Don't call us.  We'll call you.  No, no.  He'll get back to me.  He already reached out to the other DMs over there, so they already know they have my  name.  Oh, boy.  What do you think he said to them?  It's my schedule and hours and stuff.  You know, you could speed us along.  So, go in the back office and, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Pull his bag a little bit.  Yeah, exactly.  Pop his prick into your yap.  You'll be transferred immediately.  You're beautiful.  You go, can I talk to you in the office?  And then when he sits down, you fucking kneel in front of him. 
[02:34:30]  Unzip his fly.  Right.  And just grab his cock.  And take his latte.  Yeah.  His foaming latte.  Yeah, he's got some of that foam in your mouth.  Yeah, Patty.  A little squirt of vanilla on your back.  Yeah.  Yep.  Now, what were you saying about that truth, sir?  Oh, God.  There's more where that came from.  Yeah.  Tell the DM at the other place there's much more of that. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, sucker Patty's just passing out blowies to whoever wants them.  She's a lovely woman.  Oh, God, Edgar.  You like Friday, Edgar?  Yeah, Edgar's like smitten over there.  He's crushing on her.  You see him poking her.  Delightful.  Delightful.  Wow.  What a compliment.  Patty, we've got to go through the questions that we ask you every single time.  First of all, how much vacation time do you have now? 
[02:35:30]  Vacation time?  Oh, I'm up to about four or five hours now.  I've already used six hours.  I just do it as part of my paycheck.  Four or five hours.  I'm up to is the best part of that.  I'm up to four or five hours.  She would get on a flight and go, oh, fuck.  Yeah, that's it.  God damn it.  And you've been there seven and a half years.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, they're not taking advantage.  I just want to make sure.  A loyal employee like Patty.  I guarantee she's a great employee. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, you'll probably work hard.  Yeah, she only vacations four to five hours a year.  Four to five hours.  Do you get there like a little before you're supposed to start?  Yeah, I'm taking a walk around Times Square about 4 a.m.  What?  And I don't have to be there till five, but I make sure I get there.  Right.  And then when you're done, you don't walk out the second your shift is over, right?  No, I make my latte first and then I go out.  Creature of habit.  What kind of latte?  I sometimes change my clothes if I feel like it.  What kind of latte? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, what kind of latte?  My favorite is vanilla cappuccino with whipped cream and cinnamon.  Oh, very sweet.  You got a little...  You got a little...  You got a little...  You got a little...  You got a little...  You got a little...  You got a little...  You got a little sweet tooth.  That seems pretty good.  Yeah, a little sweet tooth.  That's where they pour it into your asshole.  Yeah.  Patty, I...  Tamp it down with a fucking plunger handle.  Oh, Patty.  God damn. 
[02:37:00]  Well, it sounds like you're doing very well.  Yeah, you're up to four or five hours.  That's good.  And the other question everyone wants to know, how's the sex thing?  Oh, right.  Not the sex thing.  Oh, I don't have one.  The sex thing.  Yeah, so I'm fine.  Oh.  Just still playing with yourself.  Have you been dating, though?  No.  Any dates?  No, not at all.  Anything you could even classify as a date?  Have you been out alone with a man to do anything?  Well, I had a friend from New Jersey and me go to the Olive Garden, you know, just for 
[02:37:30]  lunch a couple weeks ago.  The Olive Garden?  How was it?  Yeah, we get together about once a month, but he's just a friend.  When you're on the rag?  Oh, well.  Well, he's got to finish for it.  You know, that's it.  Just a casual friend, you know.  Yeah?  Did he kiss you goodbye?  You say he's just a friend.  Peck on the cheek?  No.  No, that's not like that at all.  We're just friends.  White guy?  You're a good woman of higher stock.  And then my other friend, you know, 30 years, I used to work with him in one of his stores 
[02:38:00]  and everything yogurt.  He took me to Atlantic City in July for my, you know, in honor of my birthday.  Happy birthday.  Did you offer to swallow his yogurt?  Shut up.  Oh, sorry, Edgar.  I'm going after Edgar's girl.  Yeah.  And then he treated me to a little bit of play, you know.  Oh.  Ass play?  A little bit of play on the machines.  Yeah.  You know, the penny machines.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I didn't win anything.  Oh.  Wait, he gave you money for the penny slots? 
[02:38:30]  Well, yeah.  How much was that?  You know, it was my birthday, so he gave me like $100 to go do that, you know.  Whoa!  $100 bucks.  $100 bucks, Patty?  What'd you do in return, you whore?  No, nothing, you know.  Yeah?  And then he took me to a concert afterwards.  B Street Band, it's called.  It's a E Street Band.  Oh, that cover band.  Yeah.  Where did you stay?  We stayed.  Oh, I got the room for free.  We had two beds, of course. 
[02:39:00]  Where?  Same bedroom, though.  Because I have a card, so.  Same room, though, right?  Yeah.  It's just two separate beds.  Whoa!  Okay.  Have you ever slept in the same room with a strange man who wasn't like that?  No, never.  What did you think?  It was kind of hot, right?  Nothing.  You know, it was just a casual friend.  I bet you couldn't sleep, though, could you?  You kept probably waking up with that dull ache between your legs.  Were you yearning to the fat, fat, fat sound from the bed next to you?  Were you yearning, hoping that you could put the two beds together? 
[02:39:30]  You know, the room was great because I have a card.  I've never stayed overnight before.  Sleeping like fucking Lucy and Ricky.  You know, I've never used any of my comps for that before.  Did you find your underwear and socks in a different place than you left them?  No.  Still on me.  Oh.  What did you sleep in?  What did you sleep in?  How did you get to...  My pajamas.  But how did you change into your pajamas without him?  There's a bathroom.  Did you fling the door open with the light on behind you and kind of lean against the  door jam and go, well, I'm in something a little more comfortable. 
[02:40:00]  Nothing like that.  No, it wasn't like a scene out of a rom-com.  Did you get out of the tub when he walked in and hugged him?  I'm sorry to disappoint you.  What was the room number?  Room 237.  I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I got nothing.  What was he wearing?  Room 237.  What was he wearing for this...  He was wearing pajamas, too.  For the sleepover.  Oh.  Really?  All loose in the front?  Commando?  Yeah. 
[02:40:30]  Did his dick come fucking...  Which one of you took your shit first in the bathroom?  Oh, yeah.  Great question.  Come on.  I don't remember stuff like that.  He just goes to the bathroom, that's...  Did you put the water on while you were shitting?  No.  Oh.  Why would you put the water on before you...  So he can't hear your fucking...  So he can't hear your percolating honey.  Coffee and fucking Atlantic City buffet shit.  Exactly.  It's a Chinese food buffet shit.  You're fucking plopping out little peel-and-peeling shrimp. 
[02:41:00]  That's what he heard.  Just plop.  Yeah.  Sure he had his ear against the door listening.  Okay.  Did you notice while you were shitting, he was outside, and he went, ugh, and the volume  on the TV went up?  Wow.  So how did you get out of bed?  I woke up.  No, no.  But did you, like...  Were you uncomfortable in your PJs in front of a man?  Yeah.  No.  Whoa.  Oh, Patty.  I grew up with 30 years.  He's like a brother to me.  Oh, that makes it hotter. 
[02:41:30]  I lost a brother than...  You're a good lady.  Oh, God.  I'm just complimenting her, trying to get in there.  Patty, this is like sex for you.  That is Penthouse Forum.  Yeah, this is like sex for Patty.  You felt a little naughty?  A little different?  Yeah.  As I've been in a room with a man?  As I put on my pajamas, I was thinking of how nice it would be to get a good night's  sleep.  There's nothing sexy about it.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Did it take him a while to go to sleep? 
[02:42:00]  I even had coffee before I went to bed.  Enough with the coffee.  Just to get the rest sexy and ready for kisses?  Oh, God.  He loves his coffee.  Enough of her with her coffee.  Yeah.  Did the guy, he couldn't get to sleep right away?  Maybe he was hinting that maybe he needed a little company on his bed?  Yeah.  No.  Did he say anything like there was bed bugs over there?  He might want to come over here.  Oh, push the beds together.  Believe me, no bed bugs.  Did you say, I'll suck your cock?  And he went, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep. 
[02:42:30]  No?  No, just crickets.  What?  You're delightful.  Delightful.  Edgar is so taken by Patty.  And stalker Patty is the only person who doesn't react when Edgar.  Creeper, he touches her.  She's got a lovely, lovely skin.  No, she stays right there.  Yeah.  I like alder women.  Alder?  Yes, I do.  Why don't you tell...  Edgar.  They're mature.  Edgar, why don't you get to her with a little humor? 
[02:43:00]  Like one of your pranks.  One of your pranks.  Look, there's watermelons in there.  April falls.  No, they look like strawberries to me.  Yes, exactly.  She's right.  April falls.  Oh, is he the worst?  Stupid Edgar.  He doesn't give her a chance to even respond.  It's not even April. 
[02:43:30]  No, it's not April either.  I don't know.  It's not even spring.  Goddamn.  So, Patty, what have you been doing for fun, though?  Like, now you work, you got your thyroid yanked out, you took your cat to the vet.  What about some free time?  A little Patty time.  A little fun.  You hoard it up in AC?  What else is there?  Yeah, what are you going to hoard it up?  Well, I haven't been there since my friend took me.  What's that?  I haven't been there since my friend took me.  When did he take you?  July 11th or 18th.  18th.  I remember every day.  I'd be like, I think it was June, July, or August.  It was July 18th. 
[02:44:00]  She knows the exact date.  I know.  God.  Because that was the last time I went.  That's why I know the exact date.  Yeah, I like to go home.  Well, okay.  I don't have my roadie right now, so I downloaded Peltalk Free, so I get to show that way.  What are you, someone's hauling equipment for you?  No, I had this roadie like almost 10 years now.  What's a roadie?  Remember the XM roadie?  XM roadie.  Remember the roadie?  Yeah, but the thing is, you know, I got to wait until I can, you know, I want to actually 
[02:44:30]  save up to get an inno and just do away with the roadie.  It's a little outdated now.  The inno's even really old.  Are people still fucking using those?  I don't know.  What's the inno again?  Well, that's all I know.  Is that the inno?  No, this is the roadie.  That's the roadie.  Okay, let me see it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I had that.  It's like something you'd find in a military vehicle.  But the thing is, you know, I owe $52, so I'm not paying until October so I could get  all the bills out of the way.  So I downloaded Peltalk Free, so I get the four or five dollars of the show a day that 
[02:45:00]  way.  Oh, boy.  What's the $52 on that?  Well, I owe $52 to XM Radio, but I can't pay it right now, so I downloaded Peltalk Free,  so I can at least get the show while I'm waiting.  Not that, okay?  Jesus Christ.  You shut the fuck up.  I didn't shut up about that.  We know how you listen.  That's for our poor fans.  Will you shut up?  Yeah, so you don't have the, you can't listen on that.  No, no, not right now.  What did you do?  I'm still getting the show anyway.  That's all too. 
[02:45:30]  Stop it.  Shut up.  Didn't we just tell you to not talk about how you get the show for free?  Knock it off.  About that.  All right?  Yeah.  Stop saying that.  It's impossible to hear it without the fucking thing.  That's the inno.  There's no way you could be hearing it.  Well, you download it on your phone.  What?  The free app.  What free app?  Peltalk Free.  Stop saying it.  Stop here. 
[02:46:00]  You are an idiot.  Trust me, she doesn't know how to do bits, so it's the real deal.  We're going to go down the hall and tell them that you own $52.  I'm paying putty.  Oh, they know.  They know?  Why?  They call you?  Yeah, they know.  They call you?  Yeah, I got the bill.  Really?  I can't pay it, so they turned me off.  They turned you off.  Right.  Yeah, so I just, you know, looked into the internet and found the other and downloaded that.  What did you find?  Yeah, the Peltalk Free. 
[02:46:30]  Stop saying it.  Yeah.  She doesn't understand.  No.  Oh, my God.  She's a wonderful, honest lady.  Patty, you want to sing a song for us today?  Yay.  What?  Sing a song.  Do you want to sing a song?  We like Patty singing.  I like that one with Will.i.am.  Which one?  That's going through my head.  You know, Scream and Shout.  I wish it was Bull.i.  Scream and Shout by Will.i.am.  What's that one? 
[02:47:00]  It's Britney Spears and Will.i.am.  It's new?  New-ish, I guess.  It's not the new Britney Spears song.  Do you get damp in the panties for Will.i.am?  No.  I just like the song.  Yeah.  Do you know how to sing it?  It's the one that goes, Will.i.am and Britney, bitch.  Yeah.  Everybody in the room.  Oh.  All Eyes on Us.  You know that one?  I love it.  Oh.  Do you know how to sing it?  I absolutely love that.  I think that they did a good job with that song. 
[02:47:30]  You know how to sing it?  Yeah.  You know the words?  Well, not by heart.  I got the lyrics.  Well, we mentioned parts.  It would have to be karaoke style again, like grandma.  Oh.  Shit dip.  Oh, Jesus.  Edgar's turning on us.  Sam, shit dip.  Oh, oh, God.  Can we karaoke this shit or what?  Yeah.  We could kind of play the song low and then.  Let her read these lyrics.  Read.  She sings.  I'm sorry.  I love that song.  I love that song.  Do you dance to it?  Can you do a little dancing for us?  A little twerking?  Yeah, but I'm not a good twerker, though. 
[02:48:00]  I can't twerker.  Let me see your twerker.  I don't know how.  Let's see your twerker, first of all.  I don't twerker.  Don't put on the Will.  I Am song.  Put on something that she could twerk to.  Let's see the twerk, first of all.  Yeah, let's see the twerking.  Let's see the twerking.  Don't.  Just show us a twerk.  I don't know how to do it, though.  I'll try it.  Well, hold on.  Yeah, wait until the music comes on.  You're delirious.  You know, I'm not hearing anything.  Well, neither way.  Yeah, we haven't played anything yet.  Anybody have an idea?  Play some, like, some hip-hop, you know?  Hip-hop? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Something this delightful woman can twerk to.  Yeah, yeah.  You've seen girls twerk, right, Patty?  Yeah, but I...  Did you see Miley Cyrus doing her little twerking?  Oh, yeah, you know what?  She's really crazy.  She's a woman who knows she's stuck.  She's really crazy.  Yeah, yeah, she is crazy.  I don't want to be her father.  So, he's probably, like...  I wouldn't want to be yours.  We'd be in jail.  You mean that fucking stockbroker that...  The hooker pregnant? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, that's fine.  Dumped her off at the fucking...  Top twerk songs.  I didn't know they had that category.  Okay, this will be good.  Yeah, why don't you just put on juvenile, back that ass up.  Oh, back that ass up.  Back that ass up.  There you go.  It's good.  But it works, right?  Yeah.  Yay.  Patty is going to...  twerk for us a little bit, huh?  You know how to do it?  You kind of lean forward, right?  You put your hands on your knees.  I do, like this?  Well, a little bit, sure. 
[02:49:30]  Get this chair out of here.  You move your ass in like a circular...  In a circular motion.  I hope I can do it well.  I bet you can.  I'm sure you can do it just fine.  Even Laverne and Shirley probably did it better.  What?  Oh, right.  I saw that video, by the way, and the guy going like this.  I don't know who that guy was that was in the studio.  That's her kid!  All right.  Now, kind of bop around.  Dance around a little.  Yeah, but I don't hear anything. 
[02:50:00]  What?  Do you hear our voices in your headphones?  No.  I don't.  She's had headphones on for 20 minutes.  She's had headphones that aren't working on her head the whole time.  Okay.  Now I hear some static.  Yeah, that's you talking.  That's your part.  It's just your voice.  Now you know how it feels.  Keep the music up.  All right.  Do you hear it?  Okay, a little bit.  Yeah.  Turn it up.  Oh, she's...  All right. 
[02:50:30]  Well, there she goes.  All right.  Patty's, uh...  I think Patty's twerking.  I think Patty's, uh...  All right.  She's got her shoulders going.  Oh.  It looks like you're in a wheelchair.  Yeah, she's doing a rolling in a wheelchair dance.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, you got to bend over more, Patty, and shake that ass.  No, bend over more.  Not your shoulders.  It's all about the ass.  Now, shake your ass.  Make it go in circles.  Try to work the ass without even working the hips. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just work your ass.  Oh, my God.  Clap your cheeks.  Let me get a booty clap.  Clap your cheeks, Patty.  Great.  No, you don't...  No, not with your hands.  Clap your cheeks together.  She looks like if Michael J. Fox was working a marionist.  Yes.  I don't know how to do it.  Yeah, huh?  I don't know.  The weird thing is, it's usually done in underpants.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, Patty, it's done in underpants, so can you take your jeans off, please?  Let me close the curtain.  Sam, you know, Sam is absolutely right on this. 
[02:51:30]  I think we're missing the sexiness.  Yeah, there has to be a little sexiness.  So, if you will, take your pants off.  Yeah, Patty, just take those pants off.  You've done it before.  This is nothing new.  You don't have to be naked.  We don't want you to be naked.  You don't have to be naked.  No, that's how the girls twerk in their bedrooms.  They go in their panties and do a little twerking.  I don't twerk in mine.  Well, you might after this.  That's dirty.  No, it's not, Edgar.  It's just a fun thing, Patty.  Patty, you've done this so much.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Take them off.  What color panties are you wearing today?  Black.  Black. 
[02:52:00]  All right, perfect.  Do you have a bra on?  Edgar's rubbing his dick.  Do you have a bra?  No, I don't need one.  I have nothing at all.  Yeah, but you probably should take the shirt off.  No.  Or you know what you could do to start?  No, please.  You could do that thing where you bring the bottom of the shirt up through the neck hole.  As you're twerking, you've got to fool around with your shirt like it's a little bit of a tease.  Take your pants off.  Patty, take your pants off.  You're going to trip and die.  Take your shoes off, Patty.  Take your shoes off.  Oh, my God.  Patty, you know how to take your pants off.  And then take the bottom of your shirt and bring it up through the neck. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  Just so you can kind of get a hint of the titties, you know?  Right.  I can't.  She doesn't understand that you could take your pants completely off.  She doesn't understand that concept.  How many times has she been in that position?  Leave the socks on.  Leave the socks on.  Leave the socks around the ankle.  The shin band-aid makes it really attractive.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do you got a shin band-aid?  Because I have myself saving my legs.  My legs.  Can we turn the music up in here?  Yeah.  How?  And add it to the headphones for the video? 
[02:53:00]  Put it up in here so she doesn't need the headphones.  I would love that, but then we'd have to be off air, right?  Yeah.  We can get you the song.  We can edit the song in.  I ain't adding no fucking song in.  Fuck that shit.  Hold on.  Take the bottom of the shirt and then bring it up and under through the neck hole.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  It'll look sexy.  It'll look sexy.  No.  You need to be sexy, Patty.  I don't think so.  If you want to, Jim, you can take your headphones off and put one near the microphone.  Oh, wow.  And that'll, you'd hear it.  Patty, up. 
[02:53:30]  I guess.  I don't know where the mic is.  And then through.  It'll look good.  You can keep the titties covered.  Like this?  But bring the bottom up through the neck hole.  So the neck hole is down.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, my God.  Make your shirt sexy.  Yeah.  You gotta be sexy.  Make your shirt sexy.  Okay.  She did it backwards.  She did it all backwards.  She's trying.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  She's got a little bit of bottom tit sticking out.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  A little bottom titty is sticking out, which is nice. 
[02:54:00]  Patty.  Oh, my God.  Maybe.  It's like you're trying to adjust.  Oh, it's not on.  It's that red switch.  I tried that.  No, the red switch right there.  I tried that.  No?  Dimmer?  XLR?  Oh, well.  That light is...  Whatever you do, don't put this...  Oh, yeah.  Just put it on your website.  Of course.  Don't even sweat it.  Please, because I don't want anyone to see it.  No, don't worry about that.  You know what? 
[02:54:30]  Somebody who won't be named is giving me a good idea.  Yeah?  To be like a twerking video, you kind of have to give yourself a bit of a wedgie with your  panties.  That's true, too.  No.  Don't we have a boombox or something you can bring in here?  Yeah.  If you want...  Why you really don't want to edit it in later, huh?  Nah, I'm fucking lazy.  I like it live, yeah.  Here.  I'll be with my phone.  Beautiful.  It's going to be loud?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Bag that ass up.  Give me your phone. 
[02:55:00]  Bag that ass up.  Hang on, let me...  Give me your phone and give me your phone.  Mmm.  That's how I do.  I'll YouTube the video, I guess.  Why do you shave your legs, Patty?  What's the point?  Because I don't like hair.  You got evil...  I'm not an eight.  What's that scar?  Or is that a cat scratch?  Where?  Here?  Above the huge bandage on your leg.  I'm shaving my legs.  What the fuck?  You're shaving with a rapier?  Well, no.  That's a violent fucking scratch. 
[02:55:30]  Well...  Yeah, perfect.  You're sharp.  I got it.  Hi, Patty.  All right.  Patty is...  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  You can take the headphones off now because you can hear the music.  All right.  You'll be able to when it starts.  Like that sexy hunched over thing she's got going.  Your posture is terrible.  It's like the middle of the evolutionary chart.  All right.  Patty's waiting. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, I'm waiting for the music.  What the fuck?  What the hell's going on?  Hang on.  Okay, no.  They replaced the audio.  Oh.  You stink.  It's not my fault.  Come on.  Just play a rap song.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I think...  And I think Liam might be coming in here with a real boombox.  Really?  If that makes it better.  Yeah.  Okay.  We could...  We could do this properly.  When?  Does she have to keep her red socks on? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I think the red socks make it work.  And yeah, while we're waiting for Liam, Patty, why don't you kind of tuck the underwear into the cheeks a little bit?  Then your skin's a little dry.  Yeah, you gotta show the cheek.  A little wedgie.  Into the butt crack.  A little wedgie.  Come on.  Show the cheeks off a little bit.  A little butt crack wedgie.  She's beautiful.  Aw, Edgar.  That's sweet.  You should go out with Edgar.  Who's Edgar?  Just bring it.  We gotta bring up...  Let the underpants ride into the... 
[02:57:00]  No!  A little bit.  Don't listen to Edgar.  Yeah, don't listen to Edgar.  Edgar is...  Well, that's Edgar.  Give yourself a bit of a wedgie.  Anything?  Yeah.  You have to be able to see ass cheeks shake.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the thing.  Patty, will you do us a favor and just kind of show your ass?  Just the cheek.  Why?  Because so you could see the shake, you know what I mean?  That's how it's gotta shake when you twerk.  Like Miley did it.  Your butt cheek's gotta shake a little.  It's just fun, like Miley.  Yeah.  It's just like Miley.  Don't worry about it. 
[02:57:30]  Is your boombox coming?  Yeah, where the fuck?  This is play-up.  We're making this a big deal.  Yeah, exactly.  What's going on now?  Oh, okay.  Okay, there she goes.  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  Now...  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  Trump, Danny.  She's doing the fucking, uh...  She's doing a little 60s dance there, though. 
[02:58:00]  A little more than a...  You gotta concentrate on the ass.  Yeah.  You gotta work the ass.  You gotta...  Put your stance a little further apart, right?  Your feet.  A little further apart.  Now, now bend over and grab your knees.  Now, now shake your ass.  Bend over more.  More.  Now shake your ass.  Yeah.  Now you're twerking.  Yeah.  This is good.  I haven't...  I know I haven't had this, uh, feeling as I'm gonna be driving home for quite a while 
[02:58:30]  today.  That feeling of complete like I'm a piece of shit.  She said it's hard because I have arthritis.  Oh.  It's hard to twerk with arthritis.  Show your ass cheeks a little bit.  Yeah, Patty.  Shake that ass.  Shake it.  Pull the underwear into the crack.  Pull it into the crack.  Give yourself a wedgie.  A little bit of a wedgie.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Perfect.  Now, now bend over more, though.  You're not bent over enough.  Now look over your shoulder.  All sexy at Jimmy.  Boy, that arthritis is a bitch. 
[02:59:00]  Holy shit.  Her joints are like rusty hinges.  This is horrible.  What are you...  Oh my God.  It's like she's being electrocuted.  She's shaking her knees.  Oh.  This is, uh, Quasimodo twerks.  Thank you.  Well.  Hey, it's the unnamed guy.  Oh, you got a boombox? 
[02:59:30]  What's that for?  Oh, I guess you plug an iPhone into it.  Wow, Patty.  That was, uh...  That was awful.  Wow, Patty.  Yeah, what else are we going to do with that?  It's good.  Jimmy's right.  Oh, well.  When you're right, you're right.  All the listeners are hearing is music.  I can't believe she's so put together.  What?  That's right.  Wow.  What, Patty?  It was all right. 
[03:00:00]  What, Patty?  Lovely.  Oh, wow.  Let's play Let's Make a Deal.  Oh, no.  Oh, it can't just be nice.  Patty, you want to play Let's Make a Deal?  How do you play that?  Well, get a mic there, Patty.  Would you like to know what you're playing for?  Lift that mic up.  Lift it up.  You can just lift...  Not like that.  No, no.  Leave it in the...  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  It doesn't move.  Just pull the stand up.  Not by the mic. 
[03:00:30]  By that.  No, no.  Grab in front of the...  Right there.  Right there.  Now push up.  No, no.  Up.  Up.  Patty, Patty, grab that.  Grab the bar.  Grab the bar.  Now pull it up.  No, no.  Up.  Up.  Yeah, keep going.  Yeah, yeah.  Like that.  Oh, my God.  Now put the mic back.  Holy shit.  Okay, now I got it.  All right.  You want to know what you're playing for?  What?  Patty, you're playing for the XMP3i. 
[03:01:00]  Whoa.  Yes, the P3i.  A wonderful receiver for Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Is there any service included with that?  It's a portable satellite receiver, an MP3 player.  Record what you love.  Listen when you want.  The XMP3i.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Hold on.  We got a big star on the line here.  Mr. Colin Quinn. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, my God.  Hi, Colin.  Hi, Patty.  I'm in Toronto right now, but I've heard from...  Oh, shit.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  Hold on.  We didn't hear you, Kyle, because all of a sudden some music cranked up in the background.  Because we're getting ready to make a twerking video with Patty.  Well, I just called to say hello because I heard Patty was on on Twitter, so I'm on Toronto,  but I had to call in.  Oh, that's nice.  I'm going to twerk for them. 
[03:02:00]  I can't wait.  I want to see this video.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to love it.  I'm just barking for an XMP3i.  Oh, boy.  Can I tell you what she's doing while she's talking to Colin Quinn?  What?  She's clenching her ass cheeks.  Oh, my God.  She's so excited.  She's ridiculously excited.  I think I'm going to...  Yeah.  I'd like to be the Robin Thicke in that one, Patty.  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah, we're Robin Thicke, right, Kyle?  What?  You know, that guy right there looks like he could pull off the Robin Thicke part. 
[03:02:30]  No, no, no, no.  He's got that nice head of hair.  I think he could pull off the Robin Thicke part.  We don't need a Robin Thicke.  Are you sure?  Yeah, that's fine.  That's good.  That's too bad.  He looks very similar to Robin Thicke.  No, no, no.  We'll figure that out.  What is he hooking up there?  Some kind of machine that hurts people's feelings?  A mean machine.  Colin, when are you coming back in here?  You going tomorrow?  I don't know.  I'm in Toronto.  But, I mean, Patty, the show's changed. 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  One time, believe me, since you've been gone, they put me on hold for Paul Anka once.  Oh, right.  That is true.  We've got to get over that, I think.  We've got to try to get past that.  You mean you are my destiny, Paul Anka?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I should have known you were a Paul Anka fan.  There's no music.  That's all.  I know certain things.  She's a wonderful woman.  Edgar is smitten.  Oh, shoot.  All right.  I've got to go, you guys. 
[03:03:30]  I'm going to pull up a package return.  Bye.  Bye-bye, Carl.  Colin Quinn in Toronto tonight.  Go find him.  You've got to love Colin Quinn.  Yes.  No, you don't.  No, you don't have to.  So what are we going to do?  Like, she's got to do the twerking way better to get the MPI?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  MP3I or whatever.  You've got to pull the underwear like this.  Watch, watch, watch.  Jim will show you.  You've got to do that.  Pull the underwear like this, Patty.  Patty, look what I'm doing.  Take the underwear and pull it up like between.  Would you think less would be if there was a hole cut in the back? 
[03:04:00]  And pull it up in between your cheeks like that.  Pull it up in between the cheeks.  I'm not going to do it.  Go ahead.  Like that?  Is she wedgie-ing?  Yeah, but do it more.  But you're getting there.  Like that?  Don't you know what a wedgie is, Patty?  Yeah.  Anyone ever give you a wedgie when you were a kid?  No.  Huh?  There you go.  That's better.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  A little more, Jimmy says.  All right.  And pull the sides up a little.  The sides, too.  Yeah, now you're talking.  And Patty, is there any way you could take your ponytail and put it in the side of your 
[03:04:30]  head instead of the back?  The side?  Oh, my God.  Just to look sexy.  Okay.  And young.  Here, take the headphones off.  So it looks sexy and young, yeah.  And just kind of get the right up here, Patty.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Now you're talking.  Yeah, yeah.  We want you to look like, you know, one of those video-ho-fessionals.  Not bad for a woman who fucking remembers life before Hoover.  There you go.  That looks sexy.  That's good.  Not at all.  Really?  Patty, Patty, turn around.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Oh, man.  Wow, Patty's got some meat on her ass. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Fucking get up in that.  What did my age do?  Oh, dude.  No, I mean like, well, forget it.  All right, Patty.  Now, you see what this girl's doing, Patty?  Oh, there you go.  Okay, study the video.  Look at her.  See?  Do you see this?  Oh, I get it.  Just making them cheeks pop.  It's everything.  Look at that.  Oh, okay.  That's every move that will break your fucking hip.  Pop that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to pop that.  Oh, okay.  You want a Molly before?  Maybe you need a Molly. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, no, I'm fine.  Oh, okay.  You're going to, you know.  Why do you turn those off?  I don't know.  Get to somewhere.  Okay, she just showed the basic motions.  Yeah, yeah, but you understand, right?  Yeah, I do.  You're getting the gist?  Yeah, go like this, and then...  That's it, right?  Yeah.  Like that, you know?  Practice a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Practice.  All right.  Whoa.  Oh, jeez.  She's going.  She's going. 
[03:06:00]  Pop that ass.  All right, are we ready?  Damn, Patty.  Patty, back up a little, though, so we got a little room to see you.  Yeah, there you go.  All right, this is for your thing now, right?  All right, this is for all the prize here, the XM-P3i. 
[03:06:30]  Twerky, girl.  Yeah, kind of look at her, see what she's doing.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like you're taking a dump.  Oh, boy.  Patty, my nigga.  Look at her go.  She's twerking.  Whoa.  Looks like she's trying to catch her balance.  Is she okay? 
[03:07:00]  I don't know.  You need an extra Boniva?  Don't want to hear a fucking shinbone snap or anything.  There's something scary and skeletal about this.  Yes, yes, right?  She's, um, oh, nice.  Ope is getting in there like a music video.  There's some, uh...  World star hip-hop!  Yeah, world star!  Wow.  Ope's going in like a music video.  It's great.  It's going to look good. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  World star hip-hop!  Yeah.  Oh, this is good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, she's gone.  I don't know what that was.  No.  Oh, she's shaking now.  Wow.  Yeah, shake the ass like that.  Bend over, though.  Bend over, yeah.  She's in red socks that are cuffed at the ankles.  With a big band-aid on her shin.  And her t-shirt is like a New York tourist t-shirt for 1989. 
[03:08:00]  What's that, the I Dream of Jeannie?  Not so much the arms, more those ass cheeks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, forget about the arms.  Get that ass moving.  Move your ass in circles.  Like in little quick circles.  Clinch it like Colin Quinn was on the phone.  And clinch like you're cutting off a log.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  She's 60?  Yeah, she's a fine motherfucker.  She's still able to fucking twerk.  Oh my God, that's great.  Hope he's getting the best video ever.  Hope he's had his phone between her legs and in her face.  Oh, this is great.  She's got a ridiculous side ponytail with a giant lime green scrunchie holding it.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Patty, can you spin around so I can see a little?  Turn around completely.  Yeah.  All right, now shake that ass.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Now she's shaking that ass.  Oh, yeah.  That's what's up.  Patty, you're not going to stay a virgin after this video comes out.  This looks like an edited scene from Eraserhead.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  Uh-huh.  There it is.  There it is.  Well, I got to say.  I got to say.  Killed it.  That was fun.  It was.  It was fun, wasn't it?  That was fun.  Are you out of breath?  Yeah, I just got tired.  A little aerobic workout.  I know.  Of course you got tired.  You're 60 and you're fucking twerking.  It's crazy.  Yeah, 58 years old.  Well, you all right?  Yeah, I'm okay.  I'm just out of breath.  Oh, my God.  It's a lot of energy.  Do you have some water? 
[03:10:00]  Have some water.  Take a seat, Patty.  Where's a chair for poor Patty?  She's got to sit down.  She's no kid anymore.  She never was.  Yeah, but I think I did good for someone high.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, of course.  Oh, God.  Some of the best fucking angles.  It's disgusting.  And her face.  It was great.  It got right in her face.  That is a good video.  I don't know.  I saw you start laughing.  Yeah, right there.  It's perfect.  Beautiful.  That is going to be a good video right there. 
[03:10:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  That shot worked out.  Did it?  The between the legs shot?  It looks good, right?  I mean, I can dance.  I got rhythm.  We know you can dance.  We've seen.  I never did that kind of dancing before.  You look damn good doing it.  You really look great, Patty.  Yep.  Terrific.  Good job, Patty.  I'm going to fucking...  I got to twerk out more.  Twerk out more.  Twerk out.  Yeah, you do the twerk workout, you know? 
[03:11:00]  That's what it is.  Twerk out.  Twerking out.  Twerk out.  Patty, you's a fine motherfucker.  Twerk out.  Thank you.  That's a compliment.  Patty, you know what?  XMP3i.  Does it come with a prescription?  Prescription?  We'll try to see if we can get her some service.  Yeah, we should get her some service.  Yeah, we're going to try to get you some service, you know?  Oh, look at that, Patty.  But there's not much we could do for the 52 bucks.  That's you.  Oh, no.  If you owe them.  I'll take my time paying it.  You know.  Why are you hugging it?  We want it today. 
[03:11:30]  Today.  You're hugging it, Patty.  You love it, huh?  Yeah.  Good job.  Man, you look sexy.  That was some twerking.  And look at that.  Slow it out.  Right to 10.  We rode Patty's ass right to 10.  Yeah, I worked my ass.  Twerks.  Oh, you did, Patty.  Patty, next time you come in here, we're going to make sure we have a wrecking ball.  Yeah.  Really get sexy.  Oh, man.  Naked, swinging on the wrecking ball. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, she is.  Oh, God.  She's just going to do everything Miley does.  Would that be hilarious?  Patty nude on a wrecking ball.  Oh, my God.  She's, like, waving to the camera.  I agree with that, babe.  That sounds like a good title for a record album, The Wrecking Ball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Play on ball, you know, but wrecking, meaning wild.  Hey.  You're clever.  You really are.  I'll give you that.  I hope somebody thinks of it.  Yeah, really. 
[03:12:30]  Well, that was good, Patty.  That was great.  Thanks for coming in.  It was very nice to hear from you again.  Absolutely.  It's been too long, you know.  I know.  I know you don't get much vacation time.  She's got a good four or five hours.  This was like, you know how when we go to, like, the Bahamas?  That's what this was for Patty.  That's what this was.  Her fucking, she's going to go back to work and go, let me tell you what I did on vacation.  She didn't have a wild time.  She was twerking.  She took her pants off.  I know, right?  Room full of guys. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  She got all, she really started clenching her ass over and over when Colin Quinn called it.  I got to tell you, the best part was when you told her to put the ponytail to the side.  Oh, yeah.  It just made it so horrific.  That really set it off.  You look like a video vixen, Patty.  You really do.  You look like one of them video hosts.  I think Jimmy's tickets are on sale.  Oh, shit.  Come on.  Wow.  10 o'clock.  Thank you, man.  Tickets are now on sale.  Tickets. 
[03:13:30]  Ticketmaster.com for Dice and I at the Beacon Theater, November the 1st.  I'm not doing just a 15-minute opener set.  I'm doing like a real 40-minute headline set and Dice has been on fire since Blue Jasmine.  So the pre-sale did extremely well.  It's probably the best pre-sale I've ever been involved with.  Wow, really?  I didn't announce it.  I didn't even know what was happening.  It was all in the email pre-sale.  So this fucking thing is going to sell out.  So you got to get your tickets, man.  I hope so.  Ticketmaster right now for November 1st, the Beacon Theater, myself and Dice doing the first gig together in many years. 
[03:14:00]  Is there anyone else?  He'll have an opener, probably.  Not that it matters.  Eleanor, I'm not sure, but I think it's just us.  Eleanor!  I remember.  I remember.  I like the Eleanor.  And her brothers are big fans of the show.  Yes.  Philly strong.  Patty, what are you promoting?  Patty.  As usual, I got nothing.  Where are you going to be?  I got nothing.  You have me.  I'm just going to go home and, you know, stay home today. 
[03:14:30]  I want to live with you.  Oh, God.  What type of proposition is that?  Make a picture of Edgar and Patty, Sam.  Ninety-six percent.  Oh, okay.  Ninety-seven percent.  Oh, uploading.  Ninety-eight percent.  Ninety-nine percent.  One hundred percent.  Nice.  Processing.  Processing.  Processing.  Processing.  Processing.  Oh, man.  Processing. 
[03:15:00]  How do you upload directly to Twitter?  I can't do that.  You can.  No, you got to go right to YouTube.  Go that.  Processing.  The processing.  I've said fuck it.  I didn't even edit this.  It doesn't need it.  Spread it straight up?  Yeah.  It doesn't need any anything.  Yeah, the people need to see this.  Perfect.  Go to my YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  It's labeled Stalker Patty Twerking.  It should be available any second.  It's processing right now.  And then I'll tweet it on my Twitter, Opie Radio.  Oh, that's cool.  Let's get our Twitter plugs out there.  Opie Radio.  Opie Radio.  Oh, yes. 
[03:15:30]  Radio.  One word.  Then you got the Anthony Cumia.  Right.  We're openly admitting we all want more followers.  Yeah, where the hell are the followers?  And then we got, of course, Jim Norton on Twitter.  Oh, boy.  Patty, you're not on the Twitter, are you?  Not Sam.  Doesn't get any.  Yeah, yeah.  I got 1,333.  Just gave it to me, baby.  Not Sam and he's.  I have more.  What, Patty?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, yeah, I'm Brooksy.  At Brooksy.  B-R-O-K-O-S-I.  Processing.  I wish it was like a good fucking name.  Like fucking Brooks.  Yeah, Brooksy.  I hope you get sued. 
[03:16:00]  That was my name.  Maybe I could kill the manager sort of like a bonus.  I used to be called that in school.  Really?  I didn't know where that came from.  Oh.  I thought it was the note left at the fucking diner that your mom ditched you at.  Because one time I was visiting Ron and Fizz and they talked about childhood names, so  I was called Brooksy.  Abandon-sy?  Yeah.  Terrible.  Just mean.  I got over 1,330 followers.  Whoa. 
[03:16:30]  To me, that's a lot.  That is a lot.  It really is a lot.  Well, good for you, Patty.  Enjoy your XMP3i.  I will.  For real, we're going to try to get a free...  Yeah, we'll try to hook you up with some service.  We'll try to get some service.  How will you know?  You turn it on and hear something.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, please don't call us.  We'll call you.  Yeah.  You know how you know?  You plug it in, right?  Yeah.  Then you get in the bathtub.  And then you drop it in...  Oh, very fine.  What?  Oh, okay. 
[03:17:00]  Really?  Yeah, we'll figure it out, Patty.  Don't worry.  Um, and we're going to see Metallica tomorrow night at the Apollo, so...  Yeah!  We should have some good stories by Monday.  Yeah.  Uh, Roland is, uh, saying...  Star-studded.  Star-studded?  Star-studded.  In what way?  A lot of celebs.  I don't know that, but like, who's on...  Who's, uh...  I don't know.  He's not saying who, but he's just saying...  Processing.  That'll take a while. 
[03:17:30]  Processing.  Process.  Yeah.  All right, I'm getting the fuck out.  Up here.  Oh, headphones coming off.  Good night, folks.  I'm starting my goddamn weekend.  Okay.  Right now!  Great seeing you guys again.  All right.  I wish I could say the same.  Have a good weekend.  All right, we'll see you guys Monday.  Bye.  Bye.  Watch out now.  The OPN Anthony Show continues.  Sort of.  After O&A Live with Sam Roberts.  It's next.  Next.  Next. 
[03:18:00]  This is After OPN Anthony.  Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Welcome to After OPN Anthony Live.  866-969-1969. 
[03:18:30]  Interns are cleaning up the studio.  Had another color issue with an intern today.  As for peanut butter bagel, came back with a cream cheese bagel.  Yuri?  No, this one.  Oh.  Jack.  The only thing that I can figure out is that these interns are not taught colors by the  intern instructors.  Eric, are you teaching the interns colors before they start?  He's the boss.  That's not in my job description, to teach them colors.  Well, you need to realize that there's something going on with the American educational system  that kids are not learning colors and shapes.  Because he didn't realize that peanut butter is like an orangey-brown color. 
[03:19:00]  And raspberries are not strawberries.  And cream cheese is white.  If you remember yesterday, like Roland was saying, we had our intern in here who he thought  he came in with raspberries, not by mistake, thinking that they were strawberries.  This is a whole other intern that, you know, didn't know the difference between cream cheese  and peanut butter.  I think, I don't know if you want to delegate that to Sal.  Sal, do you think you can be responsible for teaching the interns colors?  Well, I think in the interview process, Eric should probably, you know, hold an eye exam. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  An audiology exam.  You know, just to, you know, make sure everyone understands.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, but there's obviously.  Eric, you do have to admit, there is a gap somewhere in the communication process.  Will you give me that?  Will you give me that?  No.  I don't think so.  So what, what is it then?  I don't know.  Okay.  Because, Eric, the first rule of improv is always say no and then, and then stop. 
[03:20:00]  Yep.  Immediately.  You're pretty good with this stuff, E-Rock.  That's where I learned from Family Guy.  It is after Opie and Anthony Live, and it's going to be a great big show today because  the winner of America's Got Talent is coming in here.  Who?  Oh, the dancer.  Kenichi Abina.  Yeah, he's a crazy Asian dancing dude who, I guess in the auditions, was dancing and made  it look like he had no head, and then later on looked like he went to heaven.  He was dancing in front of a video screen, and he made the video, and he choreographed 
[03:20:30]  it.  It's amazing.  Go on YouTube and look up some of his dancing.  Do not go on YouTube and look up Opie Radio's channel, because he just uploaded immediately  the video that just happened in here, which was Stalker Patty twerking, and it was horrific.  It was obscene.  It was terrible.  510, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  What's up, Sam?  This is a professional broadcaster.  How you doing, buddy?  I don't know.  You know what?  I was just looking at the radio.  I was listening to your professionalism, and I noticed with the pad that it doesn't 
[03:21:00]  have after Opie and Anthony.  It has been your credit.  Yeah, it does.  Oh.  Maybe it just hasn't updated on your show.  Yeah, I'll load it again.  Hold on.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  But yeah, so he's coming in today.  It's going to be an exciting show, and I'm going to find out from him if he'd eat a fake  meatball, a fake apple made from fillers and preservatives.  I don't think he would.  I wonder if he'd eat a meatball that was made that way.  Like most people, you want to be able to pronounce every ingredient that goes into your  food.  If you cook at home, you use real, fresh ingredients. 
[03:21:30]  If you don't have time to cook from scratch, Mama Mancini's Meatballs is the answer for  you.  Mama Mancini's starts with 100% USDA-grated domestic beef for their meatballs and all-natural  ingredients, like genuine pecorino romano cheese, onion, parsley, breadcrumbs, eggs, and  a little salt and pepper.  Real ingredients.  That's it.  Mama Mancini's famous slow-cooked Italian sauce is made just as simply as their meatballs.  They start with whole Italian plum tomatoes, crush them, and then add natural seasonings. 
[03:22:00]  Mama Mancini's adds their meatballs to the simmering, slow-cooked sauce for the perfect  combination of flavors.  Since 1921, Mama Mancini's has never veered from Grandma Mancini's original recipe.  Real ingredients just taste better.  Mama Mancini's slow-cooked Italian sauce and meatballs, now available at your local supermarket.  And if Roland likes these meatballs, they've got to be good.  Is today the last day Eric's sponsor?  Yep.  You feeling okay about that, Eric? 
[03:22:30]  It's sad.  It is, isn't it?  It was a nice ride.  I bet it was.  But next we'll have sandwiches.  910, you're on the air.  910.  Hey.  What's that, buddy?  Hey, man.  I know who it was giving Anthony all the information yesterday.  Who?  Slavo!  Slavo, was it you giving Anthony the information?  About a fight that I had, allegedly?  No.  That's a great thing.  You know, I went to Travis after the show.  If you remember yesterday, we spent some time trying to figure out who is informing Anthony 
[03:23:00]  of the behind-the-scenes goings-on at SiriusXM.  Because over the past, like, week or two...  I thought it was you.  He's known everything that's been going on in these hallways that's outside the show.  And I told Eric it wasn't me, and Roland and Eric were both equally surprised.  Yeah.  Because they just assumed it must be me.  Roland says it's not him.  It's obviously not Eric, since a lot of the news is about Eric.  Well, most of the news was about Roland.  I went to Travis and said, all right, yeah, I figured it was you.  Don't even worry about it.  Because he didn't come on the show. 
[03:23:30]  And he goes, what?  And I go, I was telling Anthony about what's going on behind the scenes.  And he goes, no, it wasn't me.  Wait.  I have a theory, I think.  So I don't know who it was anymore.  Maybe, it might be the old Gary or Rob.  Like, hey, just so you know.  No, they weren't around for that.  He doesn't stick around and talk to...  Like, he's not going into somebody's office and gossiping.  They don't care what we do anymore.  No.  I thought it was Denny yesterday.  Me too.  And then Denny came in and said it wasn't him.  And he's probably still suspect number one.  He was waiting outside the door here.  718.  That's suspicious. 
[03:24:00]  718, you're on the air.  Yeah, buddy.  Hey.  Hey.  Future of American Broadcasting.  Thank you very much.  It is an honor for me to talk to you.  This is my first time.  I just want to let you know, I'm actually, I'm driving and...  Well, thank you.  I know I shouldn't be, but I watched that Stalker Patty twerking video.  Yeah.  While you're driving?  Yeah.  Look, you have to realize it's not just you I'm worried about the safety of.  It's all the drivers on the road with you.  Okay.  Well, I stopped.  Good. 
[03:24:30]  What'd you think?  But that is the most disturbing thing I've ever fucking seen in my life.  It is so gross.  Stalker Patty was in here just 10 minutes ago.  And I guess we ran out of stuff to talk to her about.  So it broke down that she needed to twerk.  Like, at first she was trying to twerk with, like, her shirt on and her pants on and everything.  And I'm like, Patty, like, if you're not showing some skin, it's not twerking.  So she ended up taking her pants off, hiking her underwears up.  And we put on some juvenile.  And, I mean, the shots that Opie got on this thing, he's up through her legs. 
[03:25:00]  He's close-ups of her face.  It's really, it's disgusting.  It's on his YouTube page already, which is incredible, the technology.  Huh?  Opie's out of control.  Why do you say that?  With all the shots he was getting.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Like, he has done what many have, what almost no one has, traveled between the legs of Stalker Patty.  That's crazy.  But, yeah, I mean, I've been to combat, and that's still the most disturbing thing in my life.  It's really bad.  I'm looking now at the behind, from the behind, and it's awful. 
[03:25:30]  It's awful.  Sal, you're not, now you're pretty secure in your choice of men, correct?  After seeing this video?  No, dude.  Huh?  No, it's not the case.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right, thanks, buddy.  What's your name?  Rick.  Rick, thank you, Rick.  What do you think of this, Sal?  Well, it's pretty, it's pretty awful, but, uh, she does have an ass, at least.  It's, it's interesting, because there is an ass there.  There is an ass to speak of, but, I mean, the ass is slightly above average, I'll even 
[03:26:00]  say.  Yeah, no, like, there's a lot of girls who just will be flat, completely, completely flat.  She has a slightly above average ass, but everything connected to that ass is so far below average  that it really takes the mean down.  Oof.  That is bad.  It looks like she's going into convulsion.  Uh, 614.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell Samuel, the professional that he is, he needs to distance himself from 
[03:26:30]  this video as soon as possible, because it is disgusting and disturbing, or ruin his  career.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  And I want everybody to know I had nothing to do with the production of this video.  I don't know anything about it.  I happened to be in the room when it was being filmed, but that is it.  That is all the responsibility that I will take for it.  It's gross, man.  She can at least get to shake a little bit, too, you know?  The ass, you mean?  Yeah.  I guess she can.  But nobody's enjoying it.  Stalker Patty has been doing the O&A show for, I mean, since before Sirius XM was even 
[03:27:00]  a thought to exist as a company.  Before the technology existed for satellite radio, Stalker Patty was doing the Opie and  Anthony show back in the days of WNEW, probably close to 15 years at this point.  And, uh, she came in today after all this, and I don't know if she's still, I see Opie  is getting shots of her face.  It really is filmed like a music video.  But she's just done horrifying thing after horrifying thing, and it's one of those deals 
[03:27:30]  where you think at some point a woman, mentally challenged or not, and Stalker Patty is not  diagnosed with any mental challenge, would say, all right, I can't do everything that's  asked of me.  But not Patty.  Patty is there to do whatever you ask her to do.  Scrambler in Chicago.  Hey, Sam.  Uh, if you've ever met Stalker Patty, which, when I've come to New York, I've been lucky  enough to end up at the same place as her a couple of times.  She is the quietest, sick to herself, just sitting in the corner, doesn't bother anybody, 
[03:28:00]  and when she comes on the show, they get her so far out of where I would consider her  natural zone of comfort.  Well, that's been one of the, that's been one of the questions that we've had for a  long time, is what exactly does Stalker Patty love so much about the Opie and Anthony show?  Because she couldn't be more of a wholesome, you know, don't pay attention to anybody's  business, I want to be nice to everybody, I don't want to see anybody get hurt type of  person.  But she comes on here, and there's something about the show that she loves. 
[03:28:30]  I don't think she gets the jokes, because when she's in this room, and we're all laughing  amongst each other, and we're all, you know, getting our shit out there, Stalker Patty's  not making a move.  Like, she has no idea what we're talking about most of the time.  But there's something, where Colin Quinn calls in, and I'm telling you, her pants were  off because she had just been practicing this twerk video.  You know, Colin Quinn calls in, and I look to my left, and Stalker Patty is involuntarily 
[03:29:00]  clenching and shivering her ass cheeks, because she's so excited to talk to Colin.  It was the strangest thing I'd ever seen in my life.  Rowan, you look disgusted.  Yeah, it's on the video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Yeah, there's something.  Her ass at the end starts shaking, like, a lot.  Yeah, her ass towards the end, it gets, there's a really bad shot of it towards the end.  At the end of the video?  I think it's one of those things where there was some little thing about the show that 
[03:29:30]  she liked when it first came on, and she's just glommed on to that, like she's attached  herself.  Stalker Patty is a woman who decides what she likes and doesn't like the minute she encounters  it.  Okay, so she listened to the Opie and Anthony show once.  She goes, oh, people enjoy this show.  I like it.  And then from that day forward has not questioned that thought once.  She doesn't stop and say, am I really enjoying this?  Or, what do I like about it?  Or, at the age of, however old she is now. 
[03:30:00]  Eric, do you know how old she is?  60 is probably.  I think she's 60, 61.  Is she that old?  I think at this point.  She's right there at 60, and she's not thinking to herself, maybe at this age.  58.  Okay.  She's a 58-year-old woman, and she's not thinking, maybe I shouldn't be twerking today.  Maybe today's not the day for it.  No part of her.  Or maybe just go to home AARP, that shit.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  She should be a member of AARP at this point, I believe.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  You get discounts.  It's a great thing.  But you kind of got to give up the twerking. 
[03:30:30]  And she's a virgin.  I don't know if you new listeners are aware of that.  You probably could gather it.  But yeah, she was on Maury Povich several years back.  And I think back when she was on Maury Povich, she was like a 50 or a 51-year-old virgin.  Well, now she is going to be a 60-year-old virgin.  This is the time when you realize, like, this woman is going to die without having sex with somebody.  And it's fucking crazy.  But she's still coming in here and twerking with her pants off.  And her underwear shoved up her asshole. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, we haven't seen him in a while.  I should give him a call.  Who?  Maury.  Yeah, see if he wants to do an update show.  Or get her on the test with Kirk Fox.  Yeah.  I don't know what you could test.  Test to see if her hymen is still intact.  Mike in Connecticut.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  Even people in hostage situations get assurances that their hostages are being taken care of well.  Can we hear Troy Kwan's voice to make sure that he's still alive and well?  Number one, no, you absolutely cannot. 
[03:31:30]  Because I want to keep my job.  But number two, there may be a little cameo in this video that Opie just posted.  The Stalker Patty twerking video.  Oh, very nice.  Keep your eyes open because that's what we're exposing him to.  We're not letting him say anything.  We're not, even off the air.  He's not allowed to speak to anyone in the building.  He's being held in a small wooden box.  And the only time we let him out is to watch people like Stalker Patty twerk.  And lunch.  Sal, you want to jump on that?  All right, here comes our guest.  The winner of America's Got Talent is here, Roland. 
[03:32:00]  Are you pumped?  I am.  Eric, did you watch this season?  I did.  Come on in.  We're live.  Kenichi.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Wherever you're comfortable.  We're on.  We're on the air and you can sit wherever you like.  After all, you're the winner of America's Got Talent.  You're the one here with talent, not me.  That's been established.  Grab that microphone.  This one?  Yeah, congratulations, my friend.  Thank you very much.  So how is life as the winner of AGT? 
[03:32:30]  Um, kind of feel overwhelming.  Overwhelming.  And exciting, of course.  Now, when you're performing for this show, when the show is happening and it's being filmed  and everything, are you kind of in a bubble where you're not out in the real world?  Like, the American Idol kids end up, you know, stuck in this bubble where they don't  really know what's going on until after they're off the show.  Were you kind of aware of how many people were catching on to your dance routines while  the show was on? 
[03:33:00]  Or did that kind of hit you in the past couple days?  Uh, you know that America's Got Talent is huge.  Right.  Huge impact in France all over the world.  America's Got Talent is huge internationally.  Yes.  So other countries are watching this like, why can't we be this talented?  Damn it.  I don't know about that, but...  Well, I mean, otherwise they'd be watching their own country's Got Talent, right?  Oh, yeah, but...  Yeah.  Right?  You see what I'm saying? 
[03:33:30]  It makes sense.  So, but did you...  But what I'm saying, did you know?  Were you getting this feedback or was that kind of held off from you?  Actually, I was expecting at some level, but it was way beyond my expectation.  And when did the reality hit you of how big this thing was?  Actually, after my first audition.  Oh, so early on.  Early on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  When I was in Chicago, and what it made so big difference was the YouTube, actually. 
[03:34:00]  My audition from the Chicago hits over 10 million hits.  So you got...  Now, but that's the show's YouTube hit, right?  Like, you can't put that on your own YouTube channel and get the hit...  No, no, no, no, not mine.  But you find out like...  AGT, you know, put it out.  This dance that I did, just to try to get on the show, already has 10 million hits.  So right there, it's a life changer. 
[03:34:30]  Because even if you don't even make it to the show, the fact that your audition has 10 million hits on YouTube, you just got an audience.  Yes.  Right?  Yes.  So you know already your life is changing.  Right.  So what's...  You walked into the audition confident.  You seem confident.  I saw you at the audition.  And the audition is where you did the dance where you had like that magic coat where your head could drop to the middle of your waist.  And then you could pick it back up.  And you did...  You did these crazy things.  You call it like a dance-ish routine, correct?  Yes.  Because it's not quite dance. 
[03:35:00]  Right.  Because there's other elements in there, right?  Yeah.  Because in there, like it's...  You know, it was 90 seconds.  Mm-hmm.  And I literally...  I danced maybe less than 10 seconds.  All the other stuff, it was not even dance.  That's why nobody can match you.  That's why nobody...  Because nobody can figure out what you're doing.  Right.  Like dancers are sitting there being like, well, I just do what he does.  And they're like, they don't teach this in any dancing classes.  Right.  Right.  Because I'm totally self-taught.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, what I wanted to show was not just dance, dance. 
[03:35:30]  I mean, I'm bad at dancing, actually.  You're not good.  I'm not good.  So like if you go to a wedding, it's embarrassing.  You know what I mean?  Like if you hit the dance floor at a wedding, and they're just like, no, no tricks, no videos,  no music, just you and this chick.  Yeah, but I love, you know, freestyling.  Mm-hmm.  You know, the clubbing, you know, freestyling.  Sure.  So no audience, just, you know, having fun.  Right.  And to any kind of music. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, but like when you go to a wedding, and you start freestyling, and you're doing  your thing, do you end up getting like, you know, brides mad at you because you're kind  of taking all the attention away?  Because I would imagine even if you're not intending to get an audience.  No, they like it.  They do.  Yeah.  It's like a show.  Yeah, but it's more like, you know, informal, rough.  Mm-hmm.  So it doesn't need to be really super good.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  How many routines did you prepare for AGT?  Because when you're doing America's Got Talent, the trick is that you, if you're getting 
[03:36:30]  voted through, you keep coming back, and you have to do something new every week.  Mm-hmm.  But most people don't think they're going to win the whole show.  Right.  So how many, you didn't think so.  How many routines from the audition did you have ready to go?  No, no, I was never ready to go.  You weren't.  But I threw some ideas in the concepts or story to the directors and producers, and we  talk about, we discuss maybe this is good, this is not good. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, so they help you kind of figure out what works for television and stuff like that.  Basically.  Yeah.  But the thing is, you know, this is a TV show, and from the audition, basically the people  were expecting, you know, for me to kind of energy, high pace.  Yes.  You know, the physical movements.  But what I wanted to, you know, show was not only the performer side of me, but also 
[03:37:30]  the director side of me, or like writer, or...  The storyteller.  Right.  Right.  Right, I saw the one, I saw the one routine where you basically, you created almost like  a video game behind you on the video screen.  Right.  And of course you put yourself in all the characters.  Yes.  Because if you're going to do it, you might as well have every single role.  Mm-hmm.  Put your face, I would do the same thing.  And then you synced up live dancing in front of the video screen, and it was pretty incredible.  But I would imagine that you can't do that, like, in three days. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, that's something you must have, like, that's one of my go-to things.  Right.  Um, yeah, that, like, you know, the hardest part was shooting, you know, the pre-shooting.  For the video screen.  Yeah, for the video screen, you know, against the green screen.  Right.  And make all the computer graphics, you know, the behind.  Mm-hmm.  So, this time, this is something that I always wanted to do.  But I didn't, you know, have, you know, money. 
[03:38:30]  I mean, I couldn't afford to do all that.  Right.  So, I'm glad, you know, the AGT helped me.  Yeah.  So, you had all these ideas of things you wanted to do, and finally, you have a television production budget.  Yes.  That you can pull them off.  Yes.  How was it?  I always wondered, to be a contestant on that show, and you've got all this attention coming  your way, but the judges are these giant celebrities, you know, you've got Howie Mandel, and Mel B, and Howard Stern.  Is it annoying to you, as a performer, that people pay as much attention as they do to the judges, 
[03:39:00]  when you're like, the judges are just sitting there.  I'm actually doing something on this stage.  What do you mean?  I'm sorry.  I didn't get it.  A lot of people will pay attention to the fact that these celebrities, that these judges are giant celebrities.  So, they'll go, oh, what did Howie say to Howard?  What did Mel B say to whatever?  And kind of lose the fact that there are these people on stage actually performing things.  Did that ever...  I didn't feel that way, though.  You didn't?  No.  Because when I was performing, I think the people, you know, were paying attention to me. 
[03:39:30]  But after the performance, you know, of course, you know, judges, you know, of course, they're  going to, you know, give the whole attention to the judges, because they make comments.  Right.  And it was all good, and I didn't, I mean, you know, obviously...  Once you're done performing, you don't really care what they're paying attention to anymore,  because you're finished.  Right.  Brush it off your shoulders.  Right.  I understand.  I understand.  Were you confident at the end?  Because you won...  Wednesday was the last show, correct?  Two days ago, you won?  Yes.  Does it feel like two days ago, or does it feel like it was a long time ago? 
[03:40:00]  It feels like two days ago.  It feels like two days ago.  Um, you look confident on stage.  Like, it was funny watching, like, that closing moment.  Confident?  You looked like, you were like, you had a tuxedo on.  Yeah.  You look totally confident.  That was the first time that I wore the tuxedo in my life.  Really?  In these four years.  You look like you were born in it.  Because you look like James Bond.  You know what I mean?  You look like the Asian James Bond, just up there, like, yeah, this is where I'm supposed  to be in this tuxedo.  Whereas the guy next to you, the comedian, was kind of nervous, and he was making faces, 
[03:40:30]  and he was in, like, this gray suit or whatever.  Yeah, he's a comedian.  Right.  You know, he was doing great.  Yeah, he did a great job, but you look like...  We...  You look like...  You look like I'm sitting here patiently waiting for these people to announce that  I'm the winner of America's Got Talent.  Like, you look like at no point were you wondering who was going to win this thing.  No, I was thinking, I mean, there are so many things going on in my brain at the time.  Yes.  Uh, because when I was remaining as a top two, that was a surprise already. 
[03:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  I was...  I thought, you know, from the judgment, my judgment...  Yes.  ...from the final performance...  Yes.  ...my performance was not that impressive, I thought.  You didn't think so.  No.  You probably hold yourself to a fairly high standard.  And America, you know, agree that, you know...  They didn't like it.  They didn't like it.  I mean, and I wouldn't say they didn't like it.  Mm-hmm.  It was good, but that was not great. 
[03:41:30]  Right.  Compared with my past ones.  Well, that's when you give it...  And that must be a concern of yours, too.  Like, if you do your best stuff at the audition to get on stage, you can't do worse.  You know what I mean?  You gotta just keep getting better.  Yeah, but what I was, you know, that was, I put the best stuff in audition, and I go  worse and worse and worse.  Right?  Yeah.  So...  Because you were like, okay, well, I'll just take the second best then.  You're like, oh, Jesus, I made it through.  I'll just do the third best, because... 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  You know, you weren't...  You're just like, every week is just survival.  Basically.  Yes.  But, from, you know, from maybe semifinal, semifinal, to be honest, I didn't really care  about winning or, you know...  What?  The winning the whole thing.  Why?  Because I was more...  Okay, to win, if I wanted to win...  Yeah.  Probably I would have done different things. 
[03:42:30]  More, you know, more performance side, more like intense thing.  But, I was...  I wanted to showcase my different aspect of me.  And so that, you know, my goal is doing a one-man show.  Right.  Which is what you're going to be doing now, correct?  Like, isn't...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which is great.  Right.  And I have materials, but, like, you know, to keep the high-paced and energetic, you know,  dance moves...  Right.  ...for 80, you know, one and a half hour?  Impossible.  Right. 
[03:43:00]  That's what I was thinking.  I was...  I wanted to show, you know, the different aspects of me.  Like, a video game one.  Yes.  Like, you know, like, and final performance.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't do much.  I mean, actually, that...  Even, I thought, it didn't need me on a stage.  Right.  I wanted to make something...  But they make you show up.  It's like attendance.  That I can take rest.  Yeah.  And I don't do much so that I don't get tired, but still kind of entertaining people.  Right.  And...  Yeah, that's the trick.  It's the same thing as radio. 
[03:43:30]  You just...  You do work, but if you can pre-tape as much as humanly possible and just throw it on...  Right.  You can go home and still be performing.  It's great.  Yes.  So, for me...  Yes.  I was really glad to do the different stuff.  Because in the beginning, the AG team wanted me to do, like, all the energy, you know.  But you were like...  And it seems to me like your strategy was not as much to win as it was, let me use this  TV time to be a commercial for everything I'm capable of. 
[03:44:00]  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Now, when they say you win a $1 million contract, a $1 million deal, how soon are you going to  see the million dollars?  Like, are they writing you a check for a million bucks?  Are you a millionaire now?  No.  No, you're not.  Apparently, no.  No.  I mean, no.  I don't know.  Your jacket's pretty sparkly.  Yeah, but this is, like, maybe $10.  Okay.  Okay, $10.  $5.  All right.  So, you're...  That's still $15, maybe $30 wardrobe. 
[03:44:30]  So, you're not seeing the money yet.  No, no, no.  How does that happen?  Oh, I don't know.  I have to ask them.  Yeah, you should probably clear that soon.  Because otherwise, they're going to see you coming a mile away.  And when...  How soon do you even know?  Like, what's the goal for getting to Vegas?  Like, how soon are you going to have a show in Vegas?  Oh...  That I don't know yet.  Yeah.  But we're going to...  The first step was, you know, is we, you know, me and all other, you know, performers from 
[03:45:00]  the show, we're going to go on tour.  And we, you know, stop in all different cities.  Now, is the tour...  Do you think it's humiliating for the people who didn't win?  Because they'll all open up and, like, you know, do this and do that.  And then they'll say, and now the moment you've been waiting for, here's the winner and the  most talented person here.  And everybody else is like, what did I show up for then?  No, I mean...  Like, wouldn't that be a bummer to you if you were like, what do you mean I have to go  on in the middle?  No. 
[03:45:30]  You don't think so?  You wouldn't want to headline?  You are headlining.  I don't know.  What do you mean headlining?  Like, headlining meaning you're the top of the bill.  Like, people come to see you and then it's nice that the other contestants are there.  Like, do you think that bums them out?  No, I don't think so.  How come?  Because, like, it's very interesting that inside a house, you know, we're all good friends.  Really?  Yeah.  See, I would be so...  And all the medias and surroundings all talk about the competition, who's going to win, 
[03:46:00]  who's going to lose, and who's bad, who's, you know...  But we...  Do you know why that is?  It's because all of us in the media, we're all horrible people.  And, like, we're all competitive with each other.  And, like, all I'm thinking, like, see, you're at SiriusXM.  This is not the only show you're doing.  You're going from show to show.  And, like, we're not going back to those offices and being like, oh, everybody have a  good show today.  I hope that every show on the platform gets canceled, except for mine, and that way I  could be the best.  But maybe that's just media.  Maybe that's not the way the true, talented people like yourself operate. 
[03:46:30]  Because you're a little more confident than that.  You're like, you know what?  Maybe I'll just be good at what I do, and you can also be good.  That's your mind frame?  Yeah, me not so much.  It's probably a fault, though.  You know, it's not a good thing.  Well, surprisingly, actually, like, since, like, top 24 or something, everybody, all  the contestants were so good, so nice.  And we're really good friends.  And we kind of support each other. 
[03:47:00]  We respect each other.  It's...  See, I'd be like...  I'm not trying to be just nice.  Of course.  It's the truth.  Uh-huh.  So, like, inside, you know, the holding room, very peaceful.  Mm-hmm.  But all the medias and people are talking about, you know, that, you know, the competition.  Yeah.  But...  See, I'd be sitting there in the house...  I don't know what's the nature of the...  I'd be waiting for you to go to the bathroom, right?  And you'd shut the door. 
[03:47:30]  And then I'd just sprinkle marbles right outside the door.  And hopefully you'd slip and fall and hurt your leg, and then you can't perform your  dance, and then maybe I'll win instead of you.  But that's me.  Wow.  I probably wouldn't last in the house very long, to tell you the truth.  Because my only talent is trying to sabotage other people, and that's not a real talent.  You know?  No, that's a talent, too.  You think so?  Yeah.  But they wouldn't put...  I mean, you know, Howie Mandela's not voting me through because I can sabotage people.  No, but then he should realize that's the talent, too. 
[03:48:00]  Right.  Right.  Like, I'm doing something here.  I just put all those marbles outside his door.  Do you pay attention to what other people are doing in the dance world and what people  are talking about?  Like, was this Miley Cyrus twerking thing?  Was that something that hit you?  I don't know about that.  Miley Cyrus, was it the VMA's twerking?  Do you know what twerking is?  No.  That's something you may want to incorporate into your routine, because that's what all  the kids are doing now.  It's basically like...  Tweaking?  Twerking.  Twerking.  Yeah, it's like butt shaking.  Oh.  Can I show you something?  And if you don't like it, we'll turn it off immediately. 
[03:48:30]  Okay?  Okay.  This is something that happened in this studio earlier today.  Roland, put it on the computer screen for him.  This is our friend, Stalker Patty.  This is twerking.  And you tell me if there is any artistic merit to this dance, because you're a guy who's  a pigeon I respect.  See, there she is with her side ponytail.  And this is the type of music that you would play.  It's juvenile.  That's not a descriptive.  That's the name of the artist.  You ever seen anything like that before? 
[03:49:00]  It's a dance.  You know, it's like a club dance.  But it's...  You mean the...  To twerk it.  Booty dancing.  Sure, sure, sure.  Booty shake.  Yeah.  I mean, she's not the best at it.  No, but...  Okay, so she's not the best at it.  No, no.  This is not like a prize winner, okay?  This is pretty obvious.  I don't know.  Maybe because you showed me this one, maybe she's the champion or something.  No, no, no, no.  She's still learning. 
[03:49:30]  You know?  Oh, okay.  Why?  Did you look at her like...  Supposedly, it goes like...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, what do you think of her as a dancer?  She seems to have fun.  And that's important, isn't it?  Yes.  And she's not competing anyway.  She's just having fun.  I don't think anybody's giving her a million dollars, though, do you?  No.  Maybe just to leave the room.  I'll give you a million dollars to leave.  Maybe she can have a spot for the kind of, you know, boo, like a kind of funny... 
[03:50:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Like a lot of people, you know...  They like to throw tomatoes and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Would you let her open for you at the one minute?  And that way people's expectations are so low that you can come on stage and just blow their minds.  Yeah.  You would.  Maybe.  I don't know.  It's very disturbing.  Her name's Starker Patty.  She's 58 years old.  Wow.  So that's...  Let me ask you. 
[03:50:30]  Are your...  Is your family...  Because you're a married guy, right?  Mm-hmm.  Do you have any kids?  One kid.  You have one kid.  Is your wife, before you go on America's Got Talent, is she worried?  Because what you do is...  And I mean, you're an amazingly talented guy.  And you deserve to win.  Last season, I was watching America's Got Talent.  And when they gave...  I don't know if you saw it last season.  But a dog act won the whole thing.  Like dogs that run through hoops and everything.  And I was outraged.  I couldn't believe I had given my time to that show to watch a dog act win. 
[03:51:00]  When you won this...  Because who's going to go see a dog act?  Like, I don't even watch...  It's like...  America is so obsessed, you know, to the dogs.  You think so?  Yes.  Yeah, but if you were on Vegas, out in Vegas, right?  And you're trying to sell tickets to your show.  And everybody's like, you know, Kenichi, I would go see you tonight, but I got tickets  to the dog show.  Wouldn't you be like...  You've got to be kidding me.  A dog show is what you're going to see.  No, actually, you know what?  What? 
[03:51:30]  They're amazed...  I mean...  You're amazed by them.  Well, I'm going to tell you something.  You had a lot more talent than those dogs did.  A hundred percent more.  Because those dogs, there's no way...  It's different, different.  Yeah, but those dogs couldn't have choreographed anything in front of a video screen.  They couldn't do it with wings on.  They couldn't do any of the stuff that you did.  Yeah, but they flip.  I cannot flip.  You can't do...  I'll bet you could do a flip.  Be honest with me.  I used to.  You can't...  But I stopped doing it because I broke my...  You know, my foot and...  You broke your foot while flipping? 
[03:52:00]  How'd you do it?  You know, I was on a tour.  It was a tour of a variety act show.  And was this you solo or with a group?  Solo, but at the end, you know, as a finale, everybody comes on the stage and they're doing,  like, you know, dancing.  Then when I did a flip, I saw somebody in behind.  And I was about to kick.  I was like, oh, you know, shoot.  And then I twist my body and I landed awkwardly.  Were you pissed at the guy who made you move? 
[03:52:30]  Like, why don't you learn your spot, dude?  I just broke my leg.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, man.  I would have been.  You're a good man.  You're a good man.  Was there anybody who said to you, this is not the career path for you?  Like, is there anybody...  Now that you're the winner, is there anybody that you're saying, ha ha, look at me.  I told you I'd be able to accomplish this.  Were there people in your life that were telling you, nah, it's not going to work for you?  As you were coming up.  I'm sorry, I didn't...  As you were coming up and doing this and saying, this is what I'm going to do for my career. 
[03:53:00]  Were there ever people that told you, that's not going to work out, you need a real job?  Oh.  No.  That's awesome.  Did people just recognize that you were like, wow, I can't do that.  I guess it'll work for them?  Because, like, in my mind, there's only two avenues to take what you do.  And you're either going to Vegas and getting a one-man show.  Or you're on the street outside Universal Studios doing the robot and trying to get tourists to give you money. 
[03:53:30]  Like, there's not too many different places to go with it.  So it's a very risky scenario, especially for a man that has a family.  Uh, that's true.  Yeah.  But, um, I'm pretty confident for just, you know, making, you know, living.  Mm-hmm.  Um, I mean, it's not only the two, you know, two jobs.  Either, you know, one-man show in Vegas or...  That's the only place I see you guys.  There's so many different, you know, jobs.  Like, where's the average job?  Average job? 
[03:54:00]  For somebody who does, like, dance-ish routines like you do.  Um...  Like, where's the guy who's like, well, he's not famous, but he's making a living.  Where does he go?  Like, corporate events.  Oh, I see.  Uh, like festivals, you know.  Yeah.  Like shopping malls or...  Like...  Did you have to do that for a while?  I was still doing it.  Yeah, but you're not going to do it now.  You're like a Millionaire America's Got Talent winner. 
[03:54:30]  You're a famous celebrity now.  You got YouTube clips.  You got, like, hundreds of millions of hits in YouTube.  Okay, believe me, like, two weeks later...  Yeah.  ...and everybody forgets.  It's done.  Yeah.  That's smart.  That's probably why you're not, like, a kid.  You've been through this for a while, so you're aware...  Mm-hmm.  Like, I refer to the winner of last year's America's Got Talent as the dog show people.  You're aware that, like, this burst of fame that's happening right now is not a forever thing.  Of course.  And you're ready.  Yeah.  That's pretty amazing.  But they promised you a Vegas show, so even if the fame...  No, no, they didn't promise, but... 
[03:55:00]  I thought they'd give you definitely a Vegas show.  Is he getting a Vegas show or what?  He's going on tour.  Oh, that's all.  That's all we know for sure.  Right now.  So we stopped in...  Oh, my.  We stopped in New Vegas.  Oh, my gosh.  So they really make you work for it.  Now you gotta work your ass off on the tour.  No, it's good.  You love it.  Yes, yes.  How much time do you get on the tour?  Do you know yet?  How much time?  Yeah.  Like, you specifically.  As an act.  Like, you know, like, on America's Got Talent, you would get two and a half minutes. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, probably everybody gets, like, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.  Well, you should remind them that you won.  So if everybody's getting 15, why don't you give you 25 or something like that?  You know what I mean?  Like, remind people who they came to see.  Well, you know, even though I won whole thing...  You bet you did.  Everybody feels, you know, the favorite is different.  It's a preference.  You know, like, you love sushi?  Mm-hmm.  Or hamburger?  Right.  Or chicken nuggets for me.  Or chicken nuggets?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, but you know...  You don't...  Nobody ever broke their foot telling a joke.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, everybody...  Okay, let's say everybody loves Taylor.  Mm-hmm.  He's great, by the way.  He's hilarious.  Yes.  Yes.  And everybody loves, you know, like all the, you know, the forte and all the singers.  I mean, top 12, especially, I think we had a very good, you know, contest this year.  Mm-hmm.  So it's like basically split. 
[03:56:30]  So some people, you know, a lot of people don't like me.  What?  You know?  You're the most likable guy I've ever met in my life.  No, no, I mean, as a performer, like, you know...  Well, they're nuts.  Okay, he's dumb.  They're nuts.  They're crazy.  No, no, no, no.  But...  Yesterday on Reddit, yesterday on Reddit,  Kevin Pollack said that I had a terrible voice.  I don't put any faith in Kevin Pollack's opinion anymore.  You know what I mean?  Let the haters hate, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right, well, where can people get information on the tour, most importantly?  Where?  Yeah.  Oh, I think there's a website. 
[03:57:00]  The AGT tour...  AGT live tour.  AGT live tour.com.  Well, look, yeah.  AGT live tour.com.  Look it up.  And make sure you put Kenichi Abina into YouTube.  If you haven't seen this guy, I mean, it's like, you can't even call...  You're right not to say dance.  You're smart to say it's something else because it's amazing.  Definitely check him out and check out the tour and everything.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  On the big win.  And thank you for being here today.  Thank you for having me.
