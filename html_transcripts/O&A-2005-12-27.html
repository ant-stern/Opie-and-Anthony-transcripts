<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast between Christmas and New Year's, opened with the hosts engaging in their characteristically vulgar humor, mocking a junior staff member and expressing their lack of motivation for work during the holiday period.  They recounted their Christmas experiences: Opie detailed an awkward encounter involving being dry-humped by an uncle; Anthony described a Christmas mass where the priest mispronounced "Christ," leading to the creation of the recurring joke "Lloyd, Jesus Cricht."  Their discussion of the Stations of the Cross devolved into further vulgar jokes.  Jimmy Norton contributed his own uneventful Christmas story, highlighting the prevalence of oversized inflatable snow globes.  A running gag about a staff member’s pen-chewing habit punctuated the offensive jokes.  A hostile exchange with a caller, Dennis, ensued, with the hosts mocking him and his family.  Other callers shared their Christmas anecdotes, fueling the vulgar banter.  The hosts also attempted to get their boss, Eric Logan, to grant them Friday off, ending the segment with more offensive jokes and speculation about his reaction.  Throughout this part of the show, there were multiple references to PalTalk and its female users.

The next segment heavily featured listener feedback on their XM radio success and a Christmas dinner with Pat from Monaki.  A caller suggested a "best of" show for Friday, prompting a debate about taking the day off.  Gift-giving discussions followed, focusing on a perceived slight regarding a gift for Jimmy Norton.  The hosts celebrated the high number of new XM subscribers, with callers sharing their activation experiences.  Anthony's new World War II memorabilia collection, including an Enfield rifle and an SS flag, became a point of humorous, yet controversial, discussion, prompting ribbing from Opie and other callers.  Details of the Christmas Eve dinner with Pat, including poor service, Pat's eccentric personality, and his van's dead battery incident, were recounted.  Jimmy Norton's upcoming New Year's Eve show and its aftermath were also discussed.  PalTalk and listener webcam interactions were again referenced.

The following segment started with a confusing call from "Marion," whose call was intentionally put on hold.  The focus then shifted to a television program about Seth Cook, a child with progeria, leading to insensitive and offensive jokes about his condition and life expectancy from the hosts and Jimmy "The Greek" Robinson.  They also made offensive comments about other medical abnormalities shown on the program.  The show then abruptly transitioned to a song, "He Wants It," by a rapper known as "Gangsta Fag," with sexually graphic and homophobic lyrics and discussion.  A review of *King Kong* and other movies, including *The Ringer*, featuring actors portraying people with intellectual disabilities, followed, marked by further insensitive and offensive comments about these films and a Cinemax special featuring intellectually disabled actors in *The Wizard of Oz*.  The segment concluded with a hostile phone call with "Lady Di," escalating into an aggressive exchange where the hosts questioned her parenting skills and accused her of alcoholism.  "Marion" called again, offering a somewhat more positive perspective on Lady Di's situation before the hosts continued their aggressive questioning of Lady Di.


The final provided excerpt began with a call from "Di," recounting a difficult holiday season, including the revelation that her son's father committed suicide by jumping in front of a train.  A confrontational exchange followed, punctuated by interruptions from "Marion," who was eventually told to "go fuck yourself."  The conversation then shifted to Opie's experience at B&H Photo, focusing on its predominantly Hasidic Jewish staff,  an encounter with an employee ("Laser"), and the store's security measures.  Musical interludes, a comedian promotion, and music from the Hasidic hip-hop artist Modest Yahoo followed, sparking further discussions and listener calls sharing experiences and opinions about the musician.  Several callers shared anecdotes and jokes throughout this portion of the broadcast.

[00:04:00]  We just kind of laugh at him. 
[00:04:30]  He's getting better, but we've got to break him in still.  He's a candidate for killing his wife when he gets married.  I'd love to be rocking with a console.  Oh, Snapple and Mayo, your thumbs must be lovely.  I'm featuring...  Hurricane Ben!  Or Teeny Steve!  I think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on this show.  Ramone, Ramone, Ramone!  Eric's breath smells like the diaper of a cancer patient.  Can I say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick?  I've got a few ideas. I can get it fired. 
[00:05:00]  Please use them.  Please use them.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well?  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  Where are you, boys?  Y.  R.  We are doing a show. 
[00:05:30]  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!  Ooh, that was low.  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!  There we go.  What have we got here, a fucking comedian?  Now, choke yourself!  Don't pull my fucking hand over there!  I said choke yourself!  Now lean forward and choke yourself!  Ha ha!  Choke yourself!  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  You have best to un-fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck! 
[00:06:00]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Your days to finger-banging, old Mary Jane Rutt-Rutt, through her pretty pink patties, are over!  That's right.  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  It's impossible!  I'm trying to tell you that!  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes? 
[00:06:30]  Tears to come out of my eyes!  Good fucking morning.  Hi, you're listening to the only radio show that's actually live.  Ha ha!  The only radio show stupid enough to be broadcast in between Christmas and New Year's.  Who does that?  I submit to you, nobody.  The hardest men in broadcasting.  That's right.  Isn't that someone else's slogan?  We're tough.  Is it?  We're just stupid.  That's an awful slogan.  Slogan.  We don't take days off when we're sick. 
[00:07:00]  We don't take days off when we're supposed to.  You're not supposed to work between Christmas and New Year's.  No.  No one gives a shit.  No one does in radio.  That's like just something that's known.  Christmas, New Year's, between there.  Ah, take off.  And traditional radio.  It was always because so many people are doing so many things that they're not really listening.  So it doesn't matter if you're on or off.  We really don't care.  Right.  So that's when you take your big Christmas vacation. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I guess the thinking here is that XM Satellite Radio, a lot of these fine folks got it for Christmas.  Uh-huh.  They're tuning it in and turning it on for the first time.  First time ever.  So.  Forever.  So the logic is to give them a live voice.  Give them something.  Well, here you are, motherfuckers.  Give them a live voice and crappy content because we don't feel like working.  Oh, well, now that isn't right. 
[00:08:00]  Right off the bat, if you're listening to us for the first time.  Yeah.  Hi.  Welcome.  Welcome to the program.  You might want to look up the word sarcasm.  Yeah.  And don't let this week be indicative of what you think we do.  Indicative.  We're a little better.  No, we're going to be.  Oh, no, no.  I'm not saying nothing.  We're going to be all right.  Oh, yeah.  No, don't get me.  People enjoyed the best ofs that were put together.  Oh, good.  From the time we were off.  Oh, good.  I was reading a lot of those.  A lot of the people that are new to the show over the past few weeks got to play catch up a little bit. 
[00:08:30]  Very, very good.  People listen in and hear stuff from a while back and then go,  Oh, that's what that stupid remark means.  And we're supposed to work the rest of the week, but we already have a brilliant idea for Friday.  We're already cultivating an exit plan, an exit strategy for Friday.  Friday is going to be called bonus material of the best material since coming to XM Satellite Radio.  Bonus, always good.  The material we wanted to play during the big 12-hour special that happened over the weekend. 
[00:09:00]  It's going to happen this weekend as well.  But we just ran out of time.  Yeah.  Like we didn't get to blind Krista and other fine bits.  So it'll be bonus material.  On Friday, I'm thinking, yeah.  No, this is the material that the bosses said we couldn't play.  Yeah, man.  Man.  That's right, man.  We're tough, man.  Fuck the boss, man.  You know what I call him, man?  The man, man.  Speaking of the boss, we're going to give him an opportunity to give us the day off Friday before we tell him that we're taking the day off. 
[00:09:30]  We're going to give him the opportunity.  So, Eric Logan.  What a set of nuts.  Eric Logan, I want you to call.  Within the next hour would be nice.  And I want you to offer us the day off Friday because we had such a great year for your fine company.  Guys, could you please just take the day off?  I think it would be much better if you showed some authority and gave us the day off instead of me giving you a call later today and saying we're taking the day off. 
[00:10:00]  You're having a sick in.  You know what that is when everybody calls in sick?  Yes.  I wouldn't know.  Or sick out.  They call it.  There it is.  Having a little trouble with my headphones.  Sometimes the right one just goes out on me.  And I got a Jack the Jack, as they say.  Jack the Jack.  All right.  How was everyone's Christmas?  Mine was lovely.  How was your Christmas, Opie?  I spent Christmas in Philly.  Christmas in Philly.  That sounds nice.  Philadelphia becoming my second hometown.  Is it? 
[00:10:30]  I'm going to be down there this weekend for Jim Norton's show at Tower Theater.  I won't be.  But, Ed, you're supposed to.  I know.  Am I?  But I have a seat.  This weekend?  But I have a seat.  We're all getting hotel rooms.  We're going to have steak dinner after Jim Norton's show.  It's going to be a whole extravaganza down there in Philly.  If I come, can I do a bow?  I'd love to do it.  Like I did on your HBO special?  I'd love to.  Something less masculine, if you could possibly swing that.  That'll involve sucking another man's dick, then, because I had a great Christmas besides being dry humped 
[00:11:00]  by an uncle.  Ooh.  Your own or somebody else's?  No, I think it would have been all right if it was my own uncle.  Really?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.  Again?  Quite an awkward scene at the old Christmas dinner.  Yeah, huh?  Hanging out at a house where I don't know many people, and I'm at the buffet line, and an uncle decided that, I don't know, I'm so famous or something.  There was some fame thing going on throughout the whole house while I was there. 
[00:11:30]  Was this the first other person's family's Christmas thing you were doing?  The first other's family Christmas thing?  What?  Like, don't you usually spend Christmas with your own family?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just the first one?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  Yeah, that's always an odd little thing, the first one.  And I was at the buffet, and next thing I know, I feel two man hands grabbing my hips.  And then I'm like, is this really happening? 
[00:12:00]  Am I being dry humped by an uncle I barely know?  It's a tradition.  Festivus.  And then I looked around the room, and everyone was, like, horrified, to say the least.  It wasn't even, it wasn't funny on any level.  People were like, oh, my God, what the hell is going on?  Were they all embarrassed and uncomfortable?  Oh, big time.  Big fucking time.  Did they look at you strangely when you threw down your plate and grabbed the table and pushed back?  Just wiggle your ass. 
[00:12:30]  I learned that from Jimmy.  I learned that from you, Jimmy.  It's not gay if you don't push back.  Absolutely.  You were a victim, not a faggot.  That's right.  If you don't push back, it's not gay.  So that was my Christmas dinner.  Hey, Merry Christmas.  Yeah, Merry Christmas to everybody.  Was anything said to this gentleman?  Ah, like, get your dick away from my ass?  I must really like someone, let's just put it that way, because out of respect for many,  many people, I showed major restraint. 
[00:13:00]  Let's just put it that way.  Did you turn around and say...  We're not really getting into it.  I don't know how to quit, you.  Yeah.  I showed major restraint.  Broke back buffet.  I mean, everyone can relate to the...  Pumping?  No.  No, no.  Everyone can relate to that one family member that just is out of control.  Just too far.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And there was a lot of apologizing going the next day and stuff, and I'm like, you know  what?  Every family has one.  Don't think your family is any different than anyone else's.  I got the same jerks in my family, you know?  Yeah.  He was going for the big laugh.  I cursed out an aunt one Christmas, and yeah, I mean, everyone has it.  We got a jerk drought in my family.  Really?  Yeah, we're like at that in-between phase, where I could see some young, up-and-coming jerks,  but the older jerks have moved on or died or something, you know? 
[00:14:00]  So we got like a jerk drought.  There's no real scenes at Christmas anymore.  It's just kind of everyone hanging out talking.  It's a little disappointing.  A little boring.  I miss the asshole.  A little boring, right?  Yeah.  But it was a great Christmas.  I had a lot of fun down there in Philly.  I went to Christmas mass, the first time I've done that, and that might be the first time  ever, now that I think about it.  I'm not sure, but I think that might be the first time I went to mass on Christmas. 
[00:14:30]  The only time I did that was for a chick.  Yeah.  And it was very entertaining because the priest was Vietnamese with a French accent.  What?  And I guess he was a prisoner in Vietnam.  I mean, this guy was hard.  Oh, Jesus.  And then he said something like, I got the back history of this guy.  Supposedly, he said if he ever gets out of here alive, out of prison in Vietnam or whatever,  that he would become a priest.  And wow.  Yeah, he was a priest. 
[00:15:00]  You got it at that point.  And I got a new God because throughout the whole mass, we were praying to someone called  Lloyd and Jesus Cricht.  Lloyd, Jesus Cricht?  Yeah, so Lloyd, Jesus Cricht is my new savior.  He couldn't say his.  Coming soon, my brother will be designing a Lloyd, Jesus Cricht t-shirt.  Lloyd, Jesus Cricht.  Is that, he just couldn't say it?  No, we were praying to Lloyd.  That is Cricht. 
[00:15:30]  We were praying to Lloyd, Jesus Cricht.  Jeez.  We got a little audio of the mass.  Oh, Nathaniel, thanks for helping me out.  That ended poorly.  Oops.  I don't think that's the way it should have gone. 
[00:16:00]  Oops.  Dump gook.  Shut up.  That would have been funny if he just yelled that from the back.  It's Christ, you fucking foreigner.  That's how we say it here.  Everybody was looking around going, did he just say Lloyd, Jesus Cricht?  Lloyd.  Lloyd, Jesus Cricht?  Because obviously the church was filled with a bunch of people like myself that barely go.  And they were seeing this guy for the first time.  And everyone's thinking, are we praying to Lloyd, Jesus Cricht?  Lloyd, host of the body of Christ, Lloyd. 
[00:16:30]  Words of wisdom, Chen.  Words of wisdom.  Your sins are no good here, Mr. Torrance.  Oh, shit.  Well, Lloyd.  A couple of Hail Marys too much per second, per second.  Lloyd, huh?  Lloyd, Jesus Cricht. 
[00:17:00]  Cricht.  I want a t-shirt made so badly now.  Pray to Lloyd, Jesus Cricht.  And those masses are massive.  I'm sick of the elbow humor I get when I go to church now.  Yeah, I go from time to time.  Hey, hey, hey.  Going to burn through the pew?  Well, this time it was like, it was a coincidence, but there was helicopters kind of hovering around the church.  Why is that?  And then all of a sudden, obviously someone had to elbow me and go, oh, they're here for you. 
[00:17:30]  Remember the same past thing, remember?  Remember the thing at the church, and now you're in a church?  Shut up.  Shut up.  No one cares anymore.  Did they do the Stations of the Cross?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  What's that?  That's something I used to go to.  What's the Stations of the Cross?  It's a thing where the priest goes around, and there's the Stations of the Cross, various scenarios up on the wall of Jesus taking the cross as he was crucified and things like that. 
[00:18:00]  And he goes and says a few words, and it's just like you're looking around the room and going, there's a lot of Stations, and he's on number two.  And you're just looking.  You know, I like to believe in some higher spirit, something like that, religion.  I'm not going to knock it or anything, whatever.  But church is the most boring place to be ever.  I don't care if it's a wedding, a funeral, a mass, Christmas, just any Sunday. 
[00:18:30]  There is nothing more boring than sitting in church.  Let me ask you a question about Stations.  I know that the last one, we all know how that winds up.  Yeah, it's not a good ending.  And the first one is probably the whole nailing in thing.  But what is the middle ones?  I think it's all him transporting the cross.  He rested here.  He was tired.  Yeah.  Station three.  He rested here.  He was tired.  He was tired.  You know, and then he gets a little whipping.  And then bring, you know, it's sort of like a film strip of Passion of the Christ. 
[00:19:00]  One of the stations where, like, Mary wipes his brow, though?  Yeah, things like that.  I learned that in that Passion of the Christ movie.  Oh, you learned it from that?  Holy shit.  I watched the Ben-Hur.  I couldn't watch the Passion.  Passion was good.  Passion of the Christ.  I get it.  He got beat up a lot.  Stop.  He really beat the crap out of him.  We get it.  I can't bring myself to watch it.  Why?  It's brutal.  Because I hear it's so brutal. 
[00:19:30]  Why don't you stop and watch it?  It's just a movie.  I took my dad to see that movie.  Yeah.  See, that's what kind of ruined me on it is the story of when you took your dad.  I turn to my dad during the movie, and he's crying like a baby.  I'm like, oh, I don't want to see my dad crying.  What is this?  Why couldn't there be a Jim Carrey movie out or something that we could have checked out?  He's just crying and crying and crying.  You never want to see that.  Oh, never.  It is the worst thing.  You ever see that? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, my father and I were watching a porno together.  It was blacks and blondes.  And he went from her ass to her mouth, and my father broke down.  I couldn't take it.  Started blubbering, yelling, lucky girl.  It was called Passion of the Penis.  Oh, that's awful.  Yeah, so my father-in-law once was unpleasant.  Yeah, you don't want to see it.  My father once is Le Mans.  I remember he had this old Le Mans, and the engine caught on fire right in the driveway. 
[00:20:30]  And he lifts the hood, and he's trying to get a fire extinguisher or something, and just burnt the shit out of his hands.  So he's inside the house, and he's soaking his hands under cold water, and I could see he was crying, you know.  And I kind of walk in the room.  I'm just a little bright-eyed little kid.  I walk in, and he turns around barely.  He goes, get the fuck out of here.  Like, didn't want me even in the room, you know.  That's not as bad, though.  It's all disturbing.  That's a physical thing?  Like, that's a hurt?  Like, that's like a...  Yeah, it's still bad, though.  You're fucked up.  You know, you don't want to see that. 
[00:21:00]  You don't, but emotional is worse.  You want to see him with stumps, burnt stump hands going,  Ah, well, what are you going to do, son?  Right?  Oh, my God.  There are 14 stations of the cross.  That's right, 14.  And when they're on number two, and you've been there for some time, you realize it's going to be a long night.  All right, Jesus condemned to die is the first one.  Right.  The happy little one, where I guess Pilate washes his hands of the whole situation. 
[00:21:30]  He's condemned.  Jesus carries his cross.  Jesus falls for the first time is the third station.  The fourth, Jesus meets his mother.  Fifth, Simon helps Jesus carry his cross.  Well, it's nice to see Simon finally do something nice.  He's usually just giving the contestants such a hard time.  You're not carrying the cross right.  You're awful.  I wish I could do a better Simon.  I'm an awful impersonator.  Sixth is Veronica wiping Jesus' face. 
[00:22:00]  Seventh station.  All right, all right.  Who the hell is Veronica?  I don't know.  Well, originally he asked Big Ethel or Betty to wipe his face, and Veronica was the only one.  Veronica was there.  I was brought up.  I'll wipe your forehead, Jesuskins.  I was brought up Catholic, went to religion classes and all that.  I don't remember Veronica.  I don't either.  No.  Veronica.  Seventh station, Jesus falls the second time.  Eight, Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem. 
[00:22:30]  Ninth station, Jesus falls the third time.  But he was in no condition to meet anyone at that point.  I think they shouldn't say Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem.  The tenth station gets a little sexy.  Jesus is stripped.  Eleventh station, Jesus nailed to the cross.  I thought he was going to fall again.  No, he's done falling.  Twelfth station, Jesus dies on the cross.  Thirteenth, Jesus is taken down from the cross.  And the fourteenth station of the cross, ladies and gentlemen, Jesus is laid in the tomb. 
[00:23:00]  And then we know what happens after that.  Not a lot of laughs in the stations of the cross.  Not a single chuckle.  Not a really big laugh getter at mass.  During all fourteen stages.  And you're kind of looking around the room.  Because, you know, the stations are all up on the wall, kind of high up.  Yeah.  And they go around the entire church.  So you start looking, you know, back and to the left, perhaps. 
[00:23:30]  You're there.  All right, I'm looking.  And then two, three.  And then by, you know, seven, you're kind of by the front of the room, but still the left.  And it goes on and on and on.  And if you look the wrong way, it doesn't look as bad.  You're like, hey, why are we even here?  Look.  Don't jump.  It works out in the end.  Oh, no.  You're supposed to go from left to right.  Oh.  Do it backwards.  And he's in court and they're letting him go.  Why are we even here?  They pulled him off the cross.  Right.  He got up a few times. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  He meets the chicks on the way back.  He meets chicks.  Yeah, on his way back.  As he's killing, he's meeting the chicks.  He goes to court.  He's acquitted.  He leaves.  Everything's fine.  Why are we even here?  Yeah, the Teflon Messiah.  They just couldn't get him in court.  Off again.  Yeah.  And you know they don't talk in regular person language.  And then he said to the Philistines, all right, what did he say?  Could he speak normal?  All right, why don't we play Craig Christ?  I'm just a Jew looking for...  You ever go over my cross again, you Jew motherfucker? 
[00:24:30]  Let's do a little Craig Christ.  And when we get back, we've got to find out about Jimmy's Christmas.  It's very interesting.  And we've got to find out about Anthony's Christmas.  And of course, Christmas dinner with Pat from Menachie.  It was a big event on Christmas Day.  And I heard it had a perfect ending.  It had a Pat ending.  A Pat ending?  Perfect Pat ending.  All right, we go to a quick break with Stephen Lynch doing Craig Christ.  It's Jesus' brother, yes.  Burn, burn, yes, I'm going to burn. 
[00:25:00]  Burn, burn, yes, I'm going to burn.  Burn, burn, yes, I'm going to burn.  Burn, burn, yes, I'm going to burn.  Burn, motherfucker.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio,  the pioneers of satellite radio.  We just do.  We just do the show.  We just do and do and do. 
[00:25:30]  It's all we do.  That's right.  Still waiting for Eric Logan to give us a call.  A quick call.  I know he's busy this time of year.  Quick call to give us the day off Friday  so we don't have to tell him that we are taking Friday off.  That's what we do.  So we give you a chance to make you look like a boss.  It's his chance to make it look like he was the one that came up with the idea.  That's right.  And then he could get email from all our past saying, 
[00:26:00]  wow, I want to thank you for giving O.P. and Anthony one of the last days of the year off.  Right.  Thank you, Mr. Logan, for being so brilliant.  We're waiting.  Or we're going to call it ourselves and we're going to take Friday off.  And then he looks a little bad, I think.  Then he looks bad.  Because then it looks like the animals is running the zoo.  And we're going to have amnesia when you call.  You're just going to call him and I'm going to be like,  wow, Eric Logan's on the line.  Why is he calling in? 
[00:26:30]  That's weird.  And then he's going to go,  guys, I got a great idea.  I want to give you the day off Friday.  And then we're going to be like,  thank you, Mr. Logan.  Thank you.  What an unexpected surprise.  What a great gift.  Who chews on these fucking pens?  Who fucking chews on pens in a studio?  This is disgusting.  Who would chew on a pen that everybody else handles?  You're kidding, right?  Who's the pen chewer?  That's awful.  Who doesn't chew on pens?  The gossipy guys know everything.  They're pointing in there.  Who is it?  Oh, they finally got something on Derek. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, my God.  That's kind of strange.  I thought Derek was perfect.  He doesn't even chew on them.  He just puts them in his ass and tightens it.  You're a creep.  You chew on pens in a studio?  Have everybody's dirty hands around them?  I chew on them in there.  I don't know how they get in here, but...  They probably make a break for it.  Somebody else is chewing on them in here, then.  No, I'm sure they're the same pens,  and they just kind of get rotated around.  I'm not a big pen chewer, though,  but I've chewed a few pens, but never a lot.  Yeah, I chew them on them there all the time.  You ever have one explode, like, 
[00:27:30]  and then you got blue ink mouth?  No, I have the pot...  Fucking A, dude.  Jesus Christ.  What's the matter?  Can't speak this morning?  What happened?  Nothing happened.  What happened?  What happened?  I'm tired.  I got four hours of sleep last night.  I got none of it.  I'm just sure today.  No.  Were you up with having E-Rock hours?  No.  No.  Why did you only get four hours of sleep?  I don't know, man.  It was just fucking...  One of those nights.  What are you doing?  You are really bad on the air.  I am.  That's why I don't come in here.  He's not bad. 
[00:28:00]  What's wrong?  He's doing good.  That's why I don't come in here all the time.  Don't shake this young lad's confidence.  You know what he's doing, though?  He keeps looking over his shoulder back where he's supposed to be sitting.  Like, he doesn't want to be here, which makes me want to keep him here as long as possible.  Dude, he's hitting all...  You're doing fine, dude.  It's like a dog where the dog knows where it's supposed to be.  Yeah.  Out of its environment.  Looking back.  Looking like, I want to go back there.  Dan is in his seat now.  Dan, who is comfortable on the mic.  So, what happened last night that you didn't get in his seat?  I'm not getting into this.  Well, no.  Is it Dan?  No, I'm not going to stay. 
[00:28:30]  I'm going to go back to my living room.  All right.  See, he's smart.  Wow.  He's bailing out.  There's the canopy.  The chute just opened up, and he is gently floating back to his seat.  He is smart.  He is.  All right, Jimmy.  How was your Christmas?  Oh, dude.  It was crazy.  I, uh...  No, it wasn't.  People, strap yourselves in.  I got up probably like two.  Yeah.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do, so I go to the bathroom.  I wash my hands.  I put my contacts in. 
[00:29:00]  Well, that's good.  You see better.  I see better.  I go to the computer.  Is your place decorated at all in any festive Christmas decorations at all?  No.  None.  And I was, I, you know...  Not even a hint?  Dude.  Like a wreath or something?  It could be Fourth of July, for anybody in my apartment would know.  I was so ready to do that this year.  Last year, I was walking by this place that had all these little Christmas things.  I'm like, I'm going to move in this apartment and decorate it nicely.  But then I was away the whole time, and I come back, and I forgot. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I did the same thing.  I didn't decorate anything.  My girlfriend didn't decorate, actually, because she's the one that does the decorating.  And nothing.  Because, hey...  I'm not going to be there that much longer.  There's no furniture in there.  What am I going to decorate?  But you throw a little of that, I don't know, the fake icicles up.  Like things like that?  Nah.  Because it looks just like icicles.  It's too goddamn cold to go out and put lights up and shit.  Fuck it.  By the way, the people that thought it was a great idea to get one of those oversized snow globes and throw it on your front yard. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And then you have a blower blowing fake snow in the thing.  Right, right.  I saw so many of those.  You thought you'd be the only one.  You saw that at the Walmart or the Wawa or the shop.  Oh, this is going to be good.  Oh, I'm going to be the only one in my neighborhood.  Inflatable Christmas thing.  I saw house after house after house with the same fucking thing. 
[00:30:30]  That was the big Christmas decoration this year, the oversized snow globe.  Inflatable lawn decorations.  Inflatable snow globe, right.  Very big this year.  I saw a few snowmen, a lot of the snow globes, but a few snowmen, some inflatable Santas.  Ugh.  People blow them up and throw them out there, and that's it.  The big frosty, the snowman.  Yeah.  Oversized.  Some big frosty.  Very good.  Big feet tall in your front yard.  You gave your job, you decorated it all up nice.  Now you've got to deflate it and put it back in the garage because no one cared. 
[00:31:00]  I've got to back up a second here.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Norton, you've got some set of balls breaking this kid's balls about chewing on a pen.  You eat dirty hookers' assholes.  Yeah, but I don't put them in the studio for other people to pick up and write with.  Yeah, what's your problem?  I'm not saying it's a germ thing.  I'm just saying it's awful.  Eat pens if you want to.  Mike, how long have you been listening to the show?  I don't know.  I'm way back from any W.  Oh, wow.  You should know by now.  Don't try to figure out Jim Norton.  Yeah, but the thing is, he'll sneeze in front of everybody. 
[00:31:30]  Probably not cover his mouth.  Always cover my mouth.  Dude, what about this?  He's blowing farts now with his pants down.  That can't be too healthy.  Sexy, but not too healthy.  At least if you fart through your jeans, there's some kind of filter.  Was that a challenge?  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  I think I was a challenge.  No, no, no.  I wasn't going to do this, but I'll punch to talk some shit.  All right.  Well.  God damn it, I can't.  You came so close to shitting your pants.  You're going to shit on the microphone, aren't you? 
[00:32:00]  Let's just say the worm took a little look out of the old apple.  Because I blew two in that stupid studio right next to us.  Turtle was looking around, seeing if it's safe to come out.  He's ass all the time on camera.  People love looking at your ass on the camera, by the way.  Of course they do.  It's adorable.  With the cameras positioned in a way where, when you do that, your ass is front and center.  We've got to say hi to everybody that's checking out the Pal Talk today.  On Pal Talk.  Good morning, everybody on Pal Talk.  Good morning. 
[00:32:30]  Waving.  I've got a couple of girls up there for you, Jimmy.  That's all.  Who are they?  Well, there's Lucci.  Oh, okay.  And then there's, what is that?  Lil on Cam.  Oh, okay.  I like that.  And they're both heavy smokers, I think.  Lucci likes to show her boobs.  Yeah.  She loves showing her boobs.  Oh, and there she goes.  Wow.  Thank you.  Good morning, Mr. Breakfast.  Oh, wait.  The other girl is also showing her boobs now. 
[00:33:00]  Fantastic.  Bless you.  Bless you.  There you go.  There you go.  And by the way, did we get, we got to get Eric on camera.  Are you on camera?  Do they see you?  No, we got to get another camera angle going from up on, above your head.  And that'll take care of it.  I want like Desi Arnaz, the three camera shoot genius.  Wait, why does Jimmy want E-Rock on camera?  I just wanted, because we were teasing his haircut last week, and he comes back with the new  improved Amon Gert from Schindler's List look. 
[00:33:30]  You should be randomly shooting Jews with that awful hairdo.  It's fucking horrendous.  Why don't you go to the basement and fill up your housekeeper creep?  I didn't think it was that fast.  That's definitely a Florida haircut right there.  Oh, from the side, it's worse.  You went home for Christmas, right?  Yeah.  That's a Florida haircut.  That really bugs me.  Because from the side, it's really German.  It's very World War II German. 
[00:34:00]  Are you German?  Yeah.  You are.  Oh, Nathaniel wants to take a picture of you.  You got to get a shot of that.  I got to tell you, the reason he got a haircut, because he's very influenced by what we say  about him.  We make fun of his wardrobe, the next day he has a brand new wardrobe.  We make fun of his hair, the next day he's got a new haircut.  Right?  Yeah.  I mean, be honest.  Is that right or not?  No, you're right.  Yeah.  So he took a beating on his haircut last week.  Why?  Because we thought it was a toupee, right?  It looked like a toupee.  It did. 
[00:34:30]  It looked like those commercials where you could swim with your new hair and all that.  Yes.  So now what he did was he cut the sides to make it look more like he has some kind of  rug on top of his head.  That's the problem.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  That was your hair cutter after he was done.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  All right.  And let's snip.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  Pardon you.  Pardon you.  Next.  Pardon you. 
[00:35:00]  Next.  So you're like 100% German?  German Irish.  German Irish.  Well, let me tell you, my Krautnik friend.  Johnny Fontaine never gets that awful haircut.  Ah, wow.  Brushing lessons.  Clipping lessons.  I was going to make him a big star.  And the hair on his head can't afford to look ridiculous.  You wake up in the morning, there's a bloody fucking Maury's wig in your fucking bed. 
[00:35:30]  Instead of a horse's head, it's a horse's ass, because that's who you look like with that  do.  You know by Friday he's going to be completely shaved down again.  I'm trying to help walk.  I think that'll look good with that old World War II Nazi helmet on.  It really is.  It's like you've got a tarantula on the top of your head.  That fucking haircut should come with an apartment in Austria for the 50s.  With an assumed name to get into the States.  Brazil, the white angel! 
[00:36:00]  Alright, well, is it safe?  Welcome back, E-Rock.  You and your hair.  How was your Christmas there, Anthony?  Oh, wonderful.  Were you done with your Christmas, Jimmy?  Nothing?  I didn't open one present.  I didn't see one person, except until I went to the cat dinner.  You didn't go see your family or anything?  Nah, I talked to them.  I'm going to see them.  I'm going to bring them out to LA.  And you had no gift to open up?  None.  Are you kidding?  No.  That's okay.  It's my own design.  I didn't buy any either.  Oh, you didn't get any?  I'm going to buy some today. 
[00:36:30]  My family.  I went the American Express gift card route, whatever you want to say.  And I'm noticing, or I did notice anyway, a lot of gift cards this year by the entire family.  Like Christmas Eve, my family does Christmas Eve.  Well, the news did a report.  They said gift cards were just massive this year.  Massive.  People have reached the point where it's convenient.  It's not like the old gift certificate to some cheesy place. 
[00:37:00]  You could get American Express gift cards or other gift cards that are good in multiple places.  You go, you use it like a credit card.  It looks like a credit card.  You go there.  You use it like a credit card.  And it's however much money you have on it.  Where do you get them?  AmericanExpress.com is where I got mine.  And, yeah, they get delivered to your house.  You throw them in some cards and hand them out.  And that's what I did.  The most work I did was on Photoshop.  I made something that I could print on the envelopes with everyone's name with a little shadowing and some nice festive colors and stuff and printed out a bunch of envelopes. 
[00:37:30]  By the look of disgust, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I was in the Christmas spirit.  Sounds like it.  And that's what I gave out.  Next year, I'm just going to do some wheeling and dealing.  You're going to give me a gift card?  I'm going to give you a gift card.  We swear we're good?  We're good.  Okay, let's not worry about each other.  How about me and you?  Me and you?  You're going to give me a gift card?  Okay, we're done, right?  That's it. 
[00:38:00]  That's it.  Done, right?  And then all I have to do is buy a gift from my mom and I'm good to go.  Then we had a big controversy over my mom's gift because my mother, for some reason, does not want to leave the 1800s.  The digital to her is some evil thing.  I talk to her all the time about things like the internet movie database, imdb.com.  You go there if you want to find out anything about movies.  My mother, one of the biggest movie buffs ever, loves going to the movies, loves old movies, new movies, just loves it. 
[00:38:30]  And I tell her about IMDb because there's constantly times where you go, who the fuck was the actor that was in that movie?  IMDb, you got the answer in a second.  She insists, and every year, she gets it, the big, thick, Leonard Maltin book of movies.  Like, you're going through this big encyclopedia of movies to find answers and trying to cross-reference things. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, you could just pop it on because she will not get a computer.  We have tried getting her a computer.  Maybe she reads it on the bowl.  Well, you know, a laptop fits there in the bathroom, let me tell you.  I don't think she reads it on the bowl, and I don't want that image conjured up either.  I'm only saying, play devil's advocate.  Why would you want a big book?  Sometimes I spend hours on the bowl.  I like a big, thick book to peruse.  A lot of people may do that.  That's not out of the realm.  I could read my phone on the book.  It's very handy. 
[00:39:30]  I could read my phone on the bowl, on the book, in a flub market.  No, no, no, I just, I wasn't sure what you meant.  You mean you said it probably read your phone?  All right.  Yeah.  There's plenty of things to read on the bowl.  And my mother isn't reading it on the bowl.  You mentioned stuff, too, or was that?  No.  Did I?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm just talking about reading a phone.  No, he said reading his phone.  Yeah.  I know, but you don't mind.  You can read the phone these days.  That's what you do in this modern digital age that my mother is just not, she wants no part of. 
[00:40:00]  So years ago, we tried to even get her that.  Remember when web TV was out?  Yeah.  She's like, look, it's on the TV.  Just so you can get a fucking email.  So we can send you a picture or something.  So it doesn't have to be, put a photo in the mail with a stamp and mail it to her.  She wants nothing to do with it.  They tried getting her a digital camera a couple of years ago that plugs right into a docking station on the thing.  And photos come out.  No computer involved.  I don't, ooh, no, I, yad, no, no. 
[00:40:30]  So this year, they got her a digital camera.  She wants no part of it.  So I got, and I start a big controversy because me and my girlfriend got her a Canon 35 millimeter camera.  Got a regular film camera.  And now that started because we didn't, you know, to talk.  It's like, oh, we got her a digital camera.  Now she's not even going to use the digital one because the big controversy on the gift giving for mom's camera. 
[00:41:00]  But that was about the biggest controversy.  Aside from the present my brother gave me, which probably one of the best Christmas presents ever.  Wait, wait, wait, before you go there.  Yeah.  So which camera is she going to use?  So she looks at me and goes, I'm using the film camera.  Of course.  I'm using it.  I totally undermined their attempt to get her up to speed.  And really fast because I have a thought before you move on.  Yeah.  Who else try to buy their, like, parents just a simple DVD player?  No. 
[00:41:30]  And your folks cannot figure out how to use a DVD?  Where does the tape go?  No, it's not tape anymore.  It's DVD.  And here's the.  Oh, I don't.  Their arms go up.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  It is a nightmare trying to teach your parents how to work a DVD player.  How do you rewind the DVD?  Because they can't comprehend the whole menu thing.  Yeah.  You know, they just want to be able to push play and the movie to start.  And that should be a feature on these damn things.  But they're not.  My mom cannot get past the fucking menu. 
[00:42:00]  And she can't.  She can't grasp the concept that there's a menu and you've got to move the fucking thing around to play the movie and what have you.  How did they get to be where they are in life?  How did they get so old?  That part of their brain doesn't work.  It's bizarre.  I've sat down with my mom.  I'm talking about a DVD player I actually bought her a while ago.  And I'm still trying to teach her how to use it.  And I know I'm not alone in this.  The whole menu thing just – she just wants to throw the stupid movie in and push play and go. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And most players, you just cannot do that.  They still have VCRs, videotape.  And she gets – for her birthday or Christmas, gets DVDs.  And she'll open it up like, oh, what's this?  It's a DVD.  Oh, one of the – and like, oh, one of those DVDs.  Like you're talking about you just gave her some fucking spacecraft.  They're scared.  That's why older people don't want to use it.  They're afraid.  Of what?  That they can't comprehend it. 
[00:43:00]  It's overwhelming.  The digital language is overwhelming.  That life has moved so far from them that they are obsolete.  Yes.  Is that what it is?  Picture walking into a 60-year calculus class.  That's how they feel.  Dennis in Pennsylvania.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, does this get more exciting?  Uh, no, it doesn't, fuckface.  Let me think.  What's the matter, Dennis?  Well, if the man has got my XM made, I don't have the hype they brought about you guys.  I thought I was going to put this on and hear something.  You guys –  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh, oh, no, so you're not enjoying the –  They go to one of the other stations, douche. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, no.  I'm not playing this.  You know what?  Excuse me.  You know what?  You know what?  I got good news, though.  Oh, here comes the good news.  Here it comes.  January 9th.  January 9th.  I heard Howard Kennedy come out.  Ah, that's it.  Yeah, there it is.  Ah, ah, ah.  I think I'll go over there, channel.  Dude, is that the call?  Is that the call?  Ah.  Thank you.  Is that the best you have?  Anything else, 1995?  I don't want to hear about it.  Dennis.  Anything else, 1995?  1995. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, you know, last time he might have been relevant.  Go ahead.  Got anything else?  The mic is yours, Dennis.  Go ahead.  Dennis.  Dennis.  Dennis.  You're going to have to do a lot better than saying we're boring after 40 minutes of radio.  Anything else?  I think we've proven our mark on satellite radio.  Everyone knows that, so go fuck yourself.  We've been here over a year.  Bye-bye, Dennis.  That was your time on the air, never to be heard again.  Let's see your old pal, Howie, do it.  Oh. 
[00:44:30]  I hope Dennis walks in the living room and his family is dead from carbon monoxide poisoning.  He's got XM.  I suggest.  There you go, Dennis.  There you go.  There's your laugh.  He's not, he didn't open an XM.  He didn't, he's lying.  I have an idea of what he can do.  What, Anthony?  It's original, so write it down.  All right.  I want him to take his XM radio.  Okay.  Go to the bathroom.  Right.  Flush it down the toilet.  Okay.  And then buy a Sirius.  Uh-huh.  Go in to perhaps his parents' bedroom and fuck his mother. 
[00:45:00]  You heard him, Dennis.  That's an original idea that I came up with.  And I think it's a good idea.  It certainly is.  I didn't mind Dennis hating the show.  I just didn't like his voice.  Yeah.  Hi-ya, I'm ready to hear something.  Hi-ya.  I just didn't like his phony exasperation.  Yes.  Look, if those people are out there, you're going to have to do a little better.  We're seasoned veterans at this point.  Please.  Yes.  A phone call like that is really not going to happen. 
[00:45:30]  I like this part.  Guess what?  Oh, um, I don't know, Dennis.  This is going to be a surprise.  Family dead in the living room.  Carbon monoxide poisoning.  Dennis, we're seasoned veterans.  To wreck our day, you're going to have to do much better than that.  Yeah, tad more.  Hope under the tree.  There's a ruffled dress with a stiff little body in it.  And by the way, Dennis, notice how you got air time.  You were able to talk. 
[00:46:00]  We didn't dump out of you.  Didn't cut you off in mid-sentence.  You were able to talk.  Your buddy, Howie, your pal that you got to kiss and lick that ass consistently to keep his fucking ego stoked.  Anybody from any other program that attempts to call him, you will not hear.  He will dump out of it because he's a faggot.  But he's a pussy who doesn't want anybody else's name on his airwaves because he can't handle it. 
[00:46:30]  He freaks out.  So take note of that, Dennis, when you're listening on the 9th to Howard's debut show.  And there it is.  The end of Dennis' time on our show.  I like Dennis.  I want him back.  Hopefully you taped it so you can play it over and over again.  Look what I did.  Look what I did in my silly little life.  There was a day I got to Opie and Anthony.  No, you didn't.  Fuck face.  We're on to something with this parent thing, though. 
[00:47:00]  Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, gummy boobs.  Hi, Dennis.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, not Dennis.  Chris.  Jesus.  Don't fucking insult me.  I can't get by it.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, going back to what you were talking about, I find it amazing that my father can  fly an airplane, but he can't stop his VCR from flashing 12 o'clock.  Yeah, he flies an airplane, huh?  And he can't work the VCR features.  Jesus, VCR.  I got him a DVD two years ago.  He must have called me five times. 
[00:47:30]  How do I work this again?  I gave up.  I gave up.  And my mom's no dummy, but she cannot grasp the whole DVD player with the menu and having  to hit play here and then pausing, and she just doesn't get it.  It's a fear of the overwhelming nature of the digital age.  That's all it is.  I didn't say that.  Dennis told me.  Ah.  Let's say hi to Dan in Chicago.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  What's up, Dennis?  Hello.  I just did the ultimate, guys.  I got my parents a TiVo for Christmas.  And you feel good about yourself when you're buying these big gifts for your parents going, 
[00:48:00]  ah, I finally got a gift they're really going to enjoy.  What happened there, Dan?  My mom is concerned that the neighbors are going to be upset when she hits pause.  Because she's going to somehow control network television.  That's a hot one.  So, you know, if you guys are watching, and in the middle of something, everything just  pauses, it's my mom.  It's your mother.  Yeah.  They don't understand it.  Like the computer thing.  I wanted to tell my mother to get a computer. 
[00:48:30]  We were going to get her a laptop.  Nice and easy.  It's not a big intimidating thing.  Uh, so she could get email.  She doesn't understand.  Like, and then I don't call for a while.  And she's like, oh, you know, you haven't called in a while.  Get a fucking computer.  I'll email.  You'll get pictures.  You can get video.  All of a sudden, I'll, I'll, uh, uh, email you a video.  Nothing.  Your mom could come on Pal Talk.  She could come on Pal Talk and look at luscious breasts if she wants to. 
[00:49:00]  Nothing.  She wants no part of it.  She goes, I don't know.  I'm afraid I'll just get addicted to it and sit there all day.  No, you're not.  You're petrified of it.  Yeah.  And get your parents a big, big gifts that they can't handle.  I got my mother a Yankee hat and my father a pocket pussy.  That's a nice gift to give your parents.  There you go.  Cleaning instructions?  He doesn't use it.  He's an older gentleman.  He puts it in the car.  He holds change in it.  Jim, Dad, how do you clean this thing? 
[00:49:30]  Could you come over and clean this thing for me?  By the way, there's a rumor out there that I hate gifts, and over the years, I've smashed  gifts in front of people and stuff.  Just want to let you know, if you're doing some last-minute shopping for the Opie and Anthony  show, I will accept all PSP gifts.  Thank you.  Oh, is that what you're looking for now?  I will accept all PSP gifts.  Yeah.  I will not smash any PSP gifts.  You're enjoying the PSP.  Maybe you got two of the same thing for Christmas, and you're like, ah, I don't want to go back 
[00:50:00]  to the mall and return this or exchange it.  Send it in to the show.  I'll accept all PSP gifts.  Thank you.  You know what I don't get anymore?  I don't receive.  This is the first year I haven't received any of these in a gift.  Clothes.  My mommy and aunt and aunt, everyone has stopped buying me clothes.  It's so funny you said that, because this is the first year, same thing.  Yeah.  They finally got it.  They finally got it.  They finally figured it out. 
[00:50:30]  After many, many years of realizing I'm not wearing anything, they bought me.  Yeah.  No more sweaters.  No more clothes.  I'm sure I have a couple of Van Heusen sweaters waiting for me.  Van Heusens?  They are fucking awful.  Every year they get me these things by Van Heusen.  Van Heusen sweater.  That I never wear.  I'd rather wear fucking Eric's hair on my head than a Van Heusen.  I don't get the Eric hair thing.  We told him how it looked like a toupee, so he went home paranoid, got a haircut, and  now it looks more like a toupee. 
[00:51:00]  Looks very arrogant.  And I'm not even trying to be a jerk to you.  I was.  Like, there's a distinguished line now completely around the top.  It's very young German officer.  Yeah.  But in middle college, it's Auschwitz guard German officer.  It's not like pleasant German officer.  It's sweating under the arms, randomly kill people German officer.  You're not the guy that gets out of the staff car and gets a lot of respect.  No.  You're the guy that trods about the POW camp or the concentration camp. 
[00:51:30]  You're the guy they would give a bottle to to sneak a few Jews out, and you'd take it.  Right.  You'd take it.  All right.  Brad from Atlanta.  Brad.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Morning, Big Dick Santa.  Hi.  Oh.  Yeah, man.  Pretty much my mom, but my fucking total douche of a stepdad and iPod.  Now I'm stuck hooking the thing up for it together.  And secondly, I get a list of songs that I get to download for.  Ooh.  Oh, that's so nice of you.  Yeah, it is.  But I'm pretty much just going to rig the little fucker with a bunch of suck my fucking cock and  O&A jingles, so.  You sure?  My fucking jack. 
[00:52:00]  Download gay porn clips and put his favorite song titles.  So he'll put it on and just hear fucking one man saying, you know, whatever another  man says in gay porn.  Whatever.  I almost stepped into a bear trap.  Yes.  You almost did.  Firing out quotes.  Love you, boy.  Fuck out.  An iPod is very rough to get for somebody.  Yeah.  Like an older person that has no clue.  Yeah.  Because then they have to learn how to download the songs for it.  It's just a catastrophe.  My parents asked for weird stuff.  They do? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Like my father asked for like the Harry Potter videos and some lubricant.  It's not that weird.  What a fucking freak.  The whole Harry Potter collection, some KY, that's it.  Well, he didn't know the name.  He just said, I want the movies with that Potter kid.  Bring me film starring that Potter boy.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break. 
[00:53:00]  And when we get back, we've got to hear about Christmas dinner.  You took some of the listeners out for Christmas dinner, including Pat from Monaki.  Pat from Monaki.  I want to hear all about it when we get back.  A very Pat from Monaki Christmas.  And when we get back, we're going to give Eric Logan just a few more minutes to call the  show to give us Friday off before we tell him we're taking Friday off.  We want him to look like a boss today.  Yeah.  So, Eric, after the break, call.  We're going to make believe we have no idea why you're calling.  And you're going to give us the day off.  Okay?  Because I think that's the right thing to do as a boss. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  And then what we'll do is bonus material as far as the best shit we've done since coming  to Satellite Radio.  Oh, you're going to love it.  And we'll do that on Friday.  And then the big special we ran this past weekend, it's going to run again this weekend.  But Friday could be a whole thing of stuff we didn't get to because we ran out of time.  I'm medley.  I call it bonus.  Ooh.  Do a little bonus material.  All right?  Roy.  Should we play anything going into break?  You got anything there?  How about the best of Dennis? 
[00:54:00]  I'd love to hear him again.  That guy was dangerous.  That's going to be in a best of.  He was good.  Oh, yeah.  I'll throw the challenge out there, too, to people like Dennis.  If you want to get to us, you've got to do a lot better than that.  The guy presented nothing.  We've been at this for a long time.  A long time.  And, you know, Anthony and I have been doing radio together for 12 years.  If we sucked that bad, we wouldn't be doing it anymore.  That's just a fact.  They don't just allow guys to do radio.  Hey, here you go.  You guys suck, but what the hell. 
[00:54:30]  Let's give you a show for a decade.  And if it was the mid-'90s and we had just started and he was at his peak, his prime,  back when people used to listen and be, you know, very dedicated to the program.  I don't know.  It might be a little scary.  I don't know.  2006 coming around, getting a call from a Howie fan.  It's a little old.  Little old.  Little old. 
[00:55:00]  Before we go to break, our boss is on the line.  I wonder why he's on the line.  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Everyone in Zelo.  How was your Christmas?  It was good.  My girls were sick.  But other than that, I was all right.  Aw.  I know.  What did you get for Christmas?  I got for Christmas, let's see, I got a jacket, you know, I got clothes, I got the, you know,  card from my daughter.  Aw.  You know, the little, the standard stuff.  The dad stuff, socks, underwear, you know, what you normally get your father, I guess. 
[00:55:30]  Did you send out cards with the picture of the whole family?  No, I did not do that.  You didn't do that this year?  No, not the whole family.  Just sent out the cards with a photo of the kid.  Aw.  Aw, see, that's adorable.  And you know what's funny?  We actually wrote out, my wife wrote out, you know, Opie Hughes, Anthony Acumia, and  then she went, no, we're not sitting in with him because it's going to wind up on the  air.  So I've got yours.  I would love a little picture of the little tyke.  Little, little toddler. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  But it was fun.  And you forgot Jim Norton.  Yes.  Jimmy Norton, yes.  Jimmy, you called me last night.  It was late.  I was dealing with sick kids, so I was going to call you this morning.  So I'll call you off the air.  I just wanted to talk dirty.  There's nothing really.  I hope she crossed Gary Glitter off the card list.  Oh, we got a Gary Glitter update today, by the way.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, he's a...  Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was listening over the weekend to the best of.  I thought that that was actually some really funny stuff.  There's some stuff that I missed, and I listen a lot. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And I was just thinking that this weekend that's coming up, since it's really kind of another holiday weekend, I think it'd be great if you guys maybe just kind of, I don't know, just put it back on.  Maybe put some new bits in there, and we could enjoy some of the great stuff, and you could take Friday off this Friday.  What?  I just think it'd be great.  Like, wait, wait.  Take Friday off and play some...  Yeah, play some...  There were some best ofs.  Wow.  Like the Tourette's guy with the crisscross jumps on, which didn't make this weekend...  And Crystal the Blind Girl didn't make the big end-of-year special. 
[00:57:00]  That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.  Why would we do that?  Well, I think, Jimmy, you should host it live in person that weekend.  Oh, there you go, Jim.  You could come in.  What is that?  No, it's awful.  I won't do it.  And we get paid for that?  Only if we don't get paid.  You don't get paid when you don't show up.  Could you shut Jimmy's mic off, Opie?  He's just mad that he didn't get the big Christmas gift.  Oh.  No, I have the Christmas gift. 
[00:57:30]  I just have no address because he was being a prick and wouldn't give it to me.  No, what Christmas gift?  Be honest, Eric.  After we called you out on it, you ran into a mall last minute to get Jimmy a gift.  No, that's not true.  I know Don Wicklin called me up personally and asked me for my address and said that...  And he called me up personally, too.  ...Elo wants your address, and I promptly gave him my home address, not the studio address,  and Opie's, and little Jimmy Norton.  What happened?  He never got the phone call from Don Wicklin. 
[00:58:00]  I guess not.  Oh.  The old address call didn't come through.  Oh.  So when they finally asked later, I was like...  I mean, it really didn't matter.  I was hurt and lonely.  I was like, you know what?  Hurt and lonely.  There's no...  I can't guilt somebody into buying me a Christmas gift.  And then we talked about it on the air, and I guarantee Eric Logan heard it and went to  his wife, damn it, Aaron.  We've got to go get Jimmy a gift.  I know.  I was trying to sneak one of the boys, and stupid Wicklin had to call while Norton was in  the room.  So no, I... 
[00:58:30]  Not that I was refusing to get out my address.  I just felt I can't bogart somebody like that.  You don't want to be the middle partake of that.  I get it.  I can't do that.  I understand.  However, if it's a nice gift, we can overlook the little slight...  Hey, Elo, you want to say hi to all the new XM listeners?  We have a bunch of them, by the way.  We have tons of them.  I was setting up a couple radios Christmas morning, and I was thinking to myself, man,  how many people are doing this right now?  It's crazy.  Hundreds of thousands.  Hundreds of thousands of people setting up their radio between Christmas morning and New 
[00:59:00]  Year's.  Yeah, it's...  You know, we get this little report that kind of tells you how many people have activated  their radios.  Numbers are just mind-boggling.  Since last Friday.  Really?  Yeah, it's just crazy.  Each day, it's in the...  You know, it's just...  It's huge.  So, it's great.  Very good.  Fantastic, my friend.  That's fantastic, which is why I think, you know, Friday could be a day of just greatest  hits.  You know, I think it'd be really good.  That's very nice of you.  Listen, I don't want you guys to jump to any conclusions.  I want you to think about it, and you can call me back and let me know what you think.  You know, and that is why you are the boss, because you... 
[00:59:30]  See, we never would have thought of something like that.  It's amazing.  My question for you, which I won't get into completely on the air, but I was calling about  do you know people in General Motors?  I do know some people, but I think I, you know, I know people.  I've gotten a door for people.  Yes.  He has.  Jimmy's in the market for a new car.  Well, I'm in the market for helping him.  And I think you should get a GM car, yes.  I actually am leaning towards a GM car, to be honest with you. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, not that the other car makers aren't fine.  Isn't Saturn GM?  I've always had good luck with my Saturn.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, but you got your fancier than Saturn.  Jimmy, you call me, we can talk, as we'd like to, as Sucker Patty would say.  Here's what I want.  Now, I don't know how to describe this to a car dealer, but the minute the door opens  and a girl sits in, I want her to go, do you own this?  And when I go, yes, I want her to go, oh.  I mean, we have to make that work in Vegas when we go out for the CES. 
[01:00:30]  That's the reaction you want.  Hi, do you like the car?  Why do they never show that in the showroom?  Absolutely.  At the dealership.  Holy crap.  We're at a big cellar.  We're going to be in Vegas in a week.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, you're going to be in Vegas next week.  Oh, my God.  You want to sell caddies?  Please show a guy that looks like me being blown by a hot girl in a caddy.  Believe me.  Elo, you going to Vegas?  I'll be there all week, boys.  Nice.  I want to sit at the card table with my friend, Elo. 
[01:01:00]  Just like we did.  It's our annual card game.  Absolutely.  Yeah, you got a little 21.  Hey, Mike from North Carolina.  This is pretty cool.  Mike, you got the big boss on the line.  Give him the good news.  Mike from North Carolina.  It's Ryan.  I'm sorry about that.  All right.  Go ahead.  I activated eight MiFis on Christmas Day because I bought everybody in my family one.  Eight MiFis for the family.  We love you.  That is fantastic.  Great.  And 202 is the preset in my mom's, my dad's, and my grandfather's first preset. 
[01:01:30]  I don't really know the numbers, trust me, but I'm thinking we're going to gain about  100,000 listeners to this show in the next week or two.  You're going to gain a lot.  I can be more specific by the end of the week.  All right.  I would love to know that number.  By the end of the week when you can call us at home on Friday.  I'll call you.  Have you made a decision?  So you're jumping to the decision.  I thought you guys were going to think this through.  We'll think it over.  We'll think it over.  But if it's your recommendation, I certainly am not going to second guess the boss. 
[01:02:00]  Elo, give the big push because a lot of people got gift cards.  They can still go out and get MiFis and all the way.  Listen, if you just go to xmradio.com online.  What about the people that got Best Buy gift certificates?  That's what I'm saying.  They got gift cards.  Listen, I think Best Buy is a terrific place.  Go there.  Best Buy gift cards are great.  I got one.  I know that.  I got a Best Buy gift certificate.  Did you?  Yes.  Oh.  All right.  I'm going to buy a MiFis.  Mark and Jersey.  You're on with the big boss.  Hey, ONA. 
[01:02:30]  Hey.  Good to hear you guys again.  I used to listen to you when you were on in New York.  Just got an XM for Christmas.  Got it set up yesterday.  Nice.  Why did you wait?  A lot of catching up yesterday.  Yes.  Mark, why did you wait so long?  I don't know, man.  I fucked up.  That's all right.  He's here now.  Yes, I am.  Very good, Mark.  Welcome, Mark.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for that really energetic phone call.  I got the XM.  All right, Hila.  We're going to...  They're telling us we got to get you out of here. 
[01:03:00]  We're going to take Friday off.  Thank you for that.  All right.  There you go, boy.  We really appreciate that.  Thank you.  Eric Logan.  You guys are welcome.  Can't wait to see you in Vegas.  We'll see you in Vegas.  I'll talk to you this week.  Bye, Mr. Logan.  See you guys.  All right.  Eric Logan, everyone.  The big guy.  He did the right thing.  That's it.  He's a nice man.  Oh, this conversation was going on Sunday night.  What happened?  The whole Friday conversation.  Oh, I know.  It was already going on, like, when we were out.  We were drunk at a bar. 
[01:03:30]  Fan.  Danny.  Yeah, I want to get into all that after the break.  Travis.  Saying, I go, we're off Friday, right?  And they all start shaking their heads no.  It's like, uh-oh, we got to work on this shit.  Well, is that when Travis started, like, bad-mouthing Logan and saying, like, all the shit he was going to do if we didn't get the day off?  Yep.  Travis.  Take no chances here, but out in bars when he's got a few in him?  Forget about it.  He's going to change the world.  He takes everybody.  After a few buds, he's going to change the world.  Hey, Roger in Alabama.  Hey, man.  I'd like to apologize to y'all right up front for leaving XM a couple months ago. 
[01:04:00]  Yep.  I got pissed off with your buddies there on Ryan and Fence.  I went to that stupid-ass program series, and I dumped that shit, and I came back home.  I said, I want to apologize and ask for your forgiveness.  No problem, brother.  Well, what did you do with your series unit?  Oh, I ran over it, man, with my truck.  I drive a big truck.  I believe it, because it's Alabama.  They do that type of thing down there.  Any damage to the front end of your vehicle, sir? 
[01:04:30]  You have to get an alignment?  Yeah, not the guy that an alignment.  It busted the radiator.  I need a new axle.  Did you miss us?  No, I didn't.  I didn't miss it.  I feel so sorry for all the people that bought the hype, man.  They are going to be so disappointed.  Have fun.  So fucking disappointed.  Hey, I'll plug it.  Thanks, man.  January 9th.  Have fun.  Yeah, have fun January 9th.  We're not scared of the big guy.  Trust me on that.  What I'm telling people, man, is that the service sucks. 
[01:05:00]  You lose the reception.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why I feel bad for the people that are buying the hype.  They have no idea what they're getting themselves into.  All right, Roger.  Thank you.  We've got to go to Matt in Philly real fast before the break.  Matt?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hi, Matt.  What do you got?  Just want to say, Jimmy, I'm looking forward to seeing you on New Year's Eve.  Thanks, bud.  My wife brought me tickets to your show, Third Road Seats.  I'm really looking forward to it.  And I just want to say how much of a professional you are to be working on your birthday.  I got it.  Well, you know, man, it's all about the show.  It's not about me.  There's no I in team.  Am I right or right or wrong? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, Ben.  You're right.  Are you right or right or wrong?  I'm fucking tired.  I haven't slept.  I'm still on Christmas high.  The season of giving.  And I will be down there for your fine show at Tower Theater.  You need to sell tickets still, Jimmy?  Yes.  Me and Rich Voss and Colin Quinn will be performing New Year's Eve at the Tower Theater.  You go to Ticketmaster or I think Electric Factory.  I have to get you a number because there's better tickets there.  Somebody told me Colin Quinn came out.  That's all you need to say.  Yeah.  Colin Quinn came out.  But his fly was down for a set?  That's a seller. 
[01:06:00]  Was that like a joke?  No.  Or he just?  He's 58.  I went down there at the end of that set and he was just talking about how awful and old  he was and his fly was open.  And he was just so depressed.  Yeah, I heard from a couple of people like, how did he stand up there and his fly was open?  Oh, that's so great.  Oh, I have a fine message from Colin I have to play for the folks because he was a little  rude to me at one point and he fucking straightened right up and flies right now.  He better.  He fucking knows better.  All right.  Why don't we go to break with this and we'll continue. 
[01:06:30]  We got to find out about Pat from Menachie and how you took him out for Christmas dinner.  I think he's waiting outside still.  He was downstairs when I pulled up.  Why can't he come up?  Because his van has to keep running or his battery will be part of the whole thing.  All right.  But first, this. 
[01:07:00]  There's more people sitting in that room.  What's that?  The Pal Talk here.  How many people are in Pal Talk today?  Let's see how many we have in Pal Talk.  We're setting up webcams all over the place for the people that don't know.  We're going to get one in our office, another one in the studio, maybe one in the outside  area there.  Outside the studio.  Got like 125 peering in on us on one of them. 
[01:07:30]  But then there's another site, Opie and Anthony fans, that have seven.  Jesus.  But our camera isn't there.  They probably have both rooms punched up so they could watch us and then comment between  each other on microphones.  Because I hog the mic on this.  I shut everyone off.  You're fucking Anthony.  You should.  I shut everyone else's mic off and hog it so they could just hear us in here.  Do you think that people just like to watch this because I dance sometimes?  Well, during commercial break, Jimmy pulled his pants down and shook his ass for everybody 
[01:08:00]  on Pal Talk.  It was a treat for everyone.  Oh, what a fucking treat that was.  It was just a wonderful little treat.  And people say the way he puts his leg up on the console like that is very gay.  Yeah.  Well, tell them to stop it.  All right.  See, I played a gay voice.  Dennis is right.  Anthony?  Yes.  What did your brother get you for Christmas?  I stopped you.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Yes. 
[01:08:30]  A wonderful gift for me.  It's the perfect present.  I'm going to start my collection.  Gloves that no germs can go through?  No.  That would be good, though.  That would really be good.  He got me an old World War II English rifle.  It's wonderful.  It's 1938.  Just a kraut killer, complete with a bayonet.  It's an Enfield.  Very nice.  And the thing is so heavy. 
[01:09:00]  It's made of wood, and it's got like a butt plate with metal on it that is just made for  smashing Nazi teeth in with.  Great action on it.  And it's a collector's item, but could still fire it.  And now I'm looking to pick up a German Mauser from the same era, and an M1 Garand, the  American, you know, World War II thing.  You could display it all nice, right?  To display, and then when I get my pistol license, which I'm going for, I've got about 
[01:09:30]  a four-month wait, then I could start the pistol collection.  It's going to be wonderful.  You're turning into one of those guys.  I am one of those guys, because let me tell you another gift I got that I will cherish.  My uncle got me one of the banners, flags, that the SS used to have on the front of their  staff cars.  It's got the skull and the lightning bolts on it. 
[01:10:00]  Wonderful.  I just love the era.  I love that whole World War II era.  You're telling yourself that's what it is you love.  I like the memorabilia from it.  I like the weapons.  I like the clothing.  That's great stuff.  Just say it.  The ideology.  You'll love the ideology.  It's also obvious.  I love the clothing.  I love the weapons.  I love the message.  I love the...  It's also obvious what you hate.  It's also obvious what you hate at this point.  He didn't say anything about that. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I have a...  You haven't said Happy Hanukkah once.  Happy Hanukkah to everybody.  It's the third day of Hanukkah.  Light your candles, people.  Just because I...  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  I pardon you.  Just because I appreciate the era and the weaponry and the German army was very snazzy,  snappy dressers, and I happened to pick up a leather coat that is very similar to an officer's jacket.  They photoshopped it with some patches on the sleeves that look very bad. 
[01:11:00]  Do you know you're just going to wake up one night and walk out and just see you at  three in the morning in the living room in the dark shadows dressed like a Nazi looking  at yourself in the mirror and she's going to go, what are you doing?  And you're going to go, I don't know.  Can you help me?  You're fucking...  You're losing your mind.  Gunna?  Did you say gunna?  I don't know.  Can you help me?  Can you help me? 
[01:11:30]  All right, listen.  I am the furthest thing from an Aryan.  Yeah, sure.  You're losing your mind, Anthony.  It's frightening.  It's great, though.  All guns.  We'll ride it to the end, though, man.  We'll be doing a show.  He's not even going to know where he is anymore, but we'll continue.  He'll be fucking barricaded inside his fucking house, firing at police officers, yelling,  germ pigs, germ pigs!  In between doing radio, that's what he's going to be doing during the commercials.  He's not even going to come into the studio anymore.  How could anyone...  He's going to be one of those radio guys that has to do the show from home. 
[01:12:00]  How could anyone not appreciate it?  For what reason, we don't know, but we just go with it.  How could anyone not appreciate the era?  What was going on back then?  What?  The weaponry, the collector's items of World War II.  That's what I'm attracted to.  This Enfield rifle, there's a history there.  I picked it up.  I put it to my shoulder and looked down the site, and I was like, what was seen through  this site over the years, you know, back in 1939, 1940, you know? 
[01:12:30]  Get yourself a looking glass.  Why don't you get yourself a telescope and look at the stars and say, I wonder if anybody  looked at the stars in the 40s.  Why don't you get yourself a book?  Get a kaleidoscope.  Get a kaleidoscope!  That's a lot safer for everyone.  When I snapped that bayonet on, I was thinking, did anyone get run through with this thing?  Was it used on some Nazi somewhere?  How about baseball cards?  Why don't you collect them?  I did as a kid. 
[01:13:00]  As I grow, my tastes in collectibles changed, and now it is World War II memorabilia.  I want a German Mauser.  I want an M1 Garand rifle.  And then perhaps I'll delve into things like the old grease gun.  Yeah, the grease gun.  What a noodle.  Nazi.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Hey, come on, Dave.  Hi, Nate.  Hey, Anthony.  I was wondering, have you ever been in an Army-Navy store where the guy offered you a can of Zyklon B and then said, hey, you and me, we're really the same? 
[01:13:30]  I'm just like you, man.  Just like you, man.  You and me.  No.  That was Chef from Apocalypse Now, right?  Yeah.  In Falling Down.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  No.  Take care, guys.  See, anyone who appreciates that kind of thing gets kind of labeled, you know?  Yeah.  You get kind of labeled.  I, uh, do you know that authentic, um, Nazi flags are really amazingly well-made things? 
[01:14:00]  It's not just a flag, like, with printing on it.  They're wonderfully embroidered things.  I don't own any.  I'm saying that right now.  I don't own Nazi flags.  I don't have the swastika and the eagle and the iron cross.  I own none of that.  But I've seen them in museums.  And, uh, you know, they're, they're, uh, very, it's, it's just a thing from that era that is wonderful to look at.  Way to take lemons and make lemonade.  Tell you one thing, six million dead, but, you know, all kidding aside, good craftsmen. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, they, what a high thread count, that flag head.  I, I am not downplaying the atrocities that took place during that era, uh, by, uh, many people.  The Japanese, the Nazis, uh, our own internment of the, uh, Japanese civilians was looked at as an atrocity.  Sure.  I just see it as, hey, who knows what these people were up to.  Perhaps they ought to be watched. 
[01:15:00]  Absolutely.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Rob.  Yeah, Anthony sounds like he's about to turn in that guy from falling down.  He's going to lead, like, Opie into the basement.  Hey, me and you, we're the same guy.  No, I'm not that guy.  Punch it out, guys.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Everybody hurts.  You fuckers.  Leave my car parked on the expressway.  Just going to stop driving one day and just start walking.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Just start walking. 
[01:15:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  why can't that be appreciated why can't the german army's materials be appreciated without  the ideology even coming up i deplore what they stood for their actions against the jewish people  and many others i look down upon that is an awful atrocity that was committed against many people  and nothing can ever make that a good thing but i like their clothes sure i'm glad you're saying 
[01:16:00]  that after you drop a tear watching downfall you know when hitler had to kill his dog for  those who didn't see downfall it was about hitler in the bunker and anthony admitted dropping a tear  for the old guy i never dropped a tear it just for some reason and i i i commented on that movie  downfall and said i didn't necessarily think this was a good thing the movie was a german-made movie  yes it's got german sub uh it's subtitled you got to watch it in the actual german don't watch it 
[01:16:30]  dubbed or anything of course watch it in its native german tongue and uh it's subtitle uh and uh it it  almost humanizes the man you know you see him uh testing out uh the cyanide capsules on that uh he's  going to be using and uh ava is going to be using uh he's got to kill his dogs so he uses it on his dog  and as he uh crunches the little snout of his german shepherd down on the sinai and the dog lets out a  little yelp and dies hitler's a little broken up about it and you look and it humanizes that guy and 
[01:17:00]  i said that not is not necessarily a good thing yeah but then explain this when you were watching you  were thrown out of the theater i remember when you're watching schindler's list for jumping up and  yelling god damn meddler what's the matter with you meddlers wow hey uh why don't we talk about  pat from anarchy i don't understand it's not see this is why you can't be a collector collect nice

[01:21:00]  his mother uh seems to have died right after he graduated from high school his father left the  family uh when he was about six months old uh tragic story not much of a family he uh has a  he has a sister and a brother-in-law uh who seemed to have disowned him because of something uh the  sister still keeps in touch but the brother-in-law is trying to keep the sister from having any contact  with him it's very uh i don't know there's something going on a misunderstanding surrounding 
[01:21:30]  a crib yeah yeah i'm sure it's something awful that uh he hasn't talked about so hearing this  i just decided uh my family does something on christmas eve that's the big day christmas day  we usually just wind up sitting around the house doing nothing yeah i figured let's get pat from  munaki me my girlfriend we get pat from munaki go out to a restaurant and just uh have a christmas  dinner with pat um then a couple of other people found out because you know we mentioned this on the 
[01:22:00]  air and uh either by inviting themselves or through invitations through third and fourth parties  other people turned up there was supposed to be 30 people at this event uh 17 or so showed up  so last night uh or was it the night before last um what do you invite my father it's like sunday  yes sunday night christmas uh we went to uh what was the name of the place 
[01:22:30]  provence provence it's frenchy's brother's restaurant frenchy was in california he couldn't  make it but he had had a huge fight with his brother about something i just picture two french  chefs throwing cookware at each other because uh that's that seems to be what the fight was all  about there was there was a fight and since they're both french they both ran away  oh and i wish i had this with me for that dinner uh we went imagine so there were a lot of uh message 
[01:23:00]  board people that were there uh some of my family showed up my sister and patrick showed up little  jimmy norton was there and uh pat and uh some uh listeners fans of the show they were all there uh pat  pretty much center of the table sitting there like it was a big dais everyone gathered around  our own fan was there danny showed up travis was there uh and uh we all had uh dinner big a big a

[01:30:30]  thinking uh i kind of want to go out kind of want to go out and uh hang out at a bar but there are some  people i don't want there with with us yeah that's that uncomfortable pause where you wait for the  fans to leave not that it's a bad thing again i did i enjoyed the company of everybody that was there  but i just wanted to spend a little time with the guys from the show not talking about the show just 
[01:31:00]  hanging out i never really hang out with these guys can i ask when you when you mentioned it to them  how eager were they to go out like when you said uh so uh travis uh fan and danny do you want to go  okay yeah sure okay yeah we're around so no i don't know if you guys have any plans no no plans i'm  around yeah let's go out let's go out okay they actually brought it up they actually brought it up  but now we're seeing that some people are hanging around like who uh i just got a few people that were 
[01:31:30]  there at the uh at dinner hanging around a little bit but they look like uh listeners fans  listeners fans of the show so i just decided i was going to you know go to my truck everybody was  going to full leave until everybody was gone and that happened we re-hooked up uh sorry i'm i'm  trying to i'm making sure that they're taping the progeria story progeria one of our favorite  yes i didn't mean to interrupt but i want to make sure are you recording okay can they get those 
[01:32:00]  kids hats with smaller bills on them because they got that big build oh a brave boys battle  old before his time sorry anthony kid i really apologize that's fine progeria kid how could you  not you gotta mention it uh well uh everyone leaves uh we're ready to start walking away and uh we just  start hearing this uh oh no way a perfect ending to christmas and and there it is the munaki van 
[01:32:30]  the pat for munaki van just kind of uh rocking as it's trying to start which also doubles no that was  me moving around which also doubles as our promotional vehicle by the way because xm still hasn't sent a  vehicle up to new york he has zip screwed more signage to uh the back of it and it's just uh and  there it is going click click click click to the clicking uh so now here we are we want to go out 
[01:33:00]  me the guys from the show we want to hit a bar and pat is uh there in his van with a dead battery  what do you do can i have a suggestion all right let me see what your suggestion is you  stick up your middle finger and say i'd call triple a if i were you fat boy and you head to the bar  jimmy we did exactly that we did exactly that he showed us a triple a card that he pulled out of 
[01:33:30]  his wallet he goes well i got this that's all he had to do all right good luck pat goodbye good  luck goodbye we walked we went to a bar down the street uh played some foosball for the first time  in quite a while i gotta say uh danny has some foosball skills very good he's got some skills than  has potential than has some potential who is the problem he picked up travis stinks stinks 
[01:34:00]  just spinning them oh just trying to keep from spinning them and you could just blow a shot right  past them uh horrid wispy arms one of the worst foosball players ever but we all had fun fan was  uh very good he's got some uh skills and a lot of potential blocking some shots and danny's pretty good  uh well a couple hours later uh we're hanging out at the bar and and uh it was like last call at two 
[01:34:30]  in the morning i felt like i was in boston it's new york city for god's sake keep the bar open we  weren't ready ready to leave but uh the lights come on the bounces are like all right wrap it up it's time  to leave like fuck so welcome back to our vehicles and uh what do we see off in the distance  the munaki van this is now three hours later 
[01:35:00]  three hours we're hanging out at the bar and uh there's the munaki van just sitting there we uh  slowly walk up to the window and see a certain shaved fat head leaning against the window what part  of you thought he dropped dead christmas day i was thinking perhaps and was frozen in his van  but uh we we knock on the window and uh of course he's got to be in good spirits even though he's  miserable the first thing it's not like what what it's like hey hey guys hey always happy and fun 
[01:35:30]  laughing on the outside weeping on the inside inside saying fuck triple a  yeah uh his little van hood is up uh and uh no one was there to help him what happened pat you call  triple a uh yeah i called triple a and uh apparently they have a new policy of they don't uh deal with  uh commercial vehicles they used to say uh the person's insured not the vehicle but evidently if i 
[01:36:00]  called five minutes before they would have been able to help me really that was exaggerating but  they just have a new policy of uh commercial vehicles once they found out it was a commercial  vehicle they said uh basically uh we have a new policy that pat from munaki doesn't have triple  a this just in i have video on my phone of pat walking to his dead van as we leave to go to the  bar to have a good time yeah uh danny has video and we're gonna get it up on the website uh i gotta 
[01:36:30]  try i gotta figure out what format my uh phone records in but if i can get it off and get it off online  i absolutely will do that yeah it's hysterical he just was slowly doing the uh is there video and  pictures of your night with the fans uh yeah with uh well with all the cameras going off i'm sure  they're there uh there's pictures somewhere okay bastards and then uh we come up and and fan  quick thinking on his feet uh flags down a cab and uh had the cab driver had jumper cables and gave 
[01:37:00]  uh him a jump oh yeah for 20 bucks i had to force it on him why didn't you do that like three hours  you know before yeah and that's what we were thinking why the fuck didn't you take some initiative  well i was out on the hoston street uh trying to wave down trying to wait for like a tow truck or  something that i know would have uh cables did nine of them pass by 
[01:37:30]  wait pat didn't know how'd they know it was a commercial vehicle i didn't just lie  uh because they helped me before and that wasn't a problem so i they the conversation starts steering  towards is it used for commercial purposes and i'm like uh uh uh well it's a commercial vehicle you  say no you idiot but it wasn't a problem before they they towed it from uh south jersey when i went to  my was trying to go to my wing contact you just needed a jump yeah and for some reason you you've 
[01:38:00]  decided to fall asleep in your van you're the kind of guy that i swear if you if your car got stuck in  a blizzard they would just find you dead frozen in it you wouldn't even try to do anything i didn't  want to inconvenience anybody and that's him oh well what's three hours on christmas i was gonna wait  till morning and call my friend after he had a good night's sleep pat what were you doing in the  van for those three hours for three hours while everyone else was in the show no i wasn't listening 
[01:38:30]  to anything no just jeep jeep jeep jeep jeep jeep jeep you didn't fall right to sleep did you so  what were you doing your mind had to be working what were you thinking about were any hopes and dreams  in that head i was thinking about how this balanced out a lovely uh evening  just an awful awful life this guy leads all right anything else to add there no that was 
[01:39:00]  that was pretty much it he got the jump everyone left it was um it was the first time in a in years i  drove home with a pretty good buzz felt good to drive out drunk again i've done that in a while  i mean as much as i love pat i gotta say it's a funnier story if he died in the van yeah yeah  i like that very much you could do that michael j pollard and screwed i was thinking more i was  thinking more bond scott yeah okay all right pat you had a good christmas though oh it was fabulous 
[01:39:30]  i'd like to thank anthony his girlfriend and anthony's sister she's a sweetie and just her  yes dawn and patrick were there did you get a uh any good gifts there oh yeah they gave me a uh  a framed picture of uh dawn and her boyfriend patrick in my new family yeah see the the the gag gift  i guess for pat was to give him a picture in a frame so he can put it in his house so he could look at 
[01:40:00]  family photos even though they're not his family i'm not going on grandma's boat next year  he's got nobody what what are your plans for new year's eve are you going to to philly uh  i i guess now i wasn't gonna i'm kind of broke so i've been trying to lay low i don't want to be  pat from the streets of monarchy he doesn't have oh what months behind in rent and stuff don't you live 
[01:40:30]  in a trailer yes i do you rent it uh well the the space there's a there's a pad fee i believe they  call that a pad fee what could a pad fee for a trailer possibly cost it's like uh it comes up to  like 700 a month are you shitting me 700 a month for a slab of concrete well plus water and and heat  and and the stuff for the stove i have propane for stove and oh so it's 700 covers everything  we're gonna have a fundraiser soon no what type of trailer is it is it a one of those does it can 
[01:41:00]  you hook it right up 70 buddy trailer a 1970 buddy yeah and does it have wheels uh yeah but i i wouldn't  try and roll it anywhere no is it is it because i know there are two types of trailers there's the the  square type the rectangular type that people live in almost like a house yeah then there's the ones 
[01:41:30]  that are pretty much just meant to hook up behind a pickup truck or something there's like a permanent  uh thing here it's like 30 feet long 12 feet wide all right it's a 12 foot wide 30 footer  right all right yeah well all right we might have to have a fundraiser yes five pad a shotgun  well i'd love to drive around in an opie and anthony van promoting the show all day  have my career that would be great yeah that would be great for everybody how much would a new trailer 
[01:42:00]  cost oh i don't know if you got a new one the new ones are like houses these days they got like  vaulted ceilings and everything they're like 50 000 bucks yeah like about 50 g's they really figured  out how to make you could get it does yours leak oh yeah i got a hole in the floor from when my foot  fell through because i had a water leak that i came home one day and it was just like the floor was  all wait wait a minute you you have a you stepped through your house yeah my foot went all the way 
[01:42:30]  to the ground it's like it's like three feet off the ground and i got a real big bruise on my five  because my one leg like crunched up underneath me and the other foot went straight down to the ground  now what did you do with this hole in the floor uh i covered it with a piece of metal  what was it a rust did it rust is that what it was no no no no it's like sub-flooring but it got wet  and then it got weak and i it rotted so you're so your ceiling leaks uh no no not not the ceiling 
[01:43:00]  no i had like a pipe burst and like the kitchen and since the trailer isn't level all the water went  to one side now what do you do like one of batman's arch enemies uh pads where it's all on a angle  what do you do in the winter don't your pipes freeze uh yes as a matter of fact uh they do yeah  everyone that i know that owns a trailer their pipes freeze uh because there's supposed to be  some kind of skirting underneath and some heat maybe under there yeah i have like trestle where 
[01:43:30]  there's like holes in it yeah so the wind blows through your pipes freeze so what you go the winter  without water no what i do is i try and keep the uh faucet running so he's got to keep his faucet  running so it doesn't freeze yeah now what about heat what type of heat do you have in this thing  uh kerosene heater a kerosene no it's kerosene run furnace do you what you actually might help if  if you if you the car you take up a hose for the exhaust pipe and you hook that up and you put the 
[01:44:00]  the other out of the fucking trailer window and you allow that to warm it up for you now isn't there  a danger of carbon monoxide poisoning in in there those trailers uh with the kerosene the flow  isn't sort of lined up correctly yeah i do i do sleep well at night jesus i get real drowsy  the problem you know what we should do we got can we do cribs before uh we have to do for this  weekend a pat from monoxide are you home the rest of the week pat uh uh well it's kind

[01:46:30]  everybody that is a fucking dick and uh they had a falling out big fight but uh uh again frenchy even  though i know it's not you it's your brother but boy you're cut from the same cloth nothing no little  deal no bottle of wine off or something he didn't do anything nothing not a nothing and anthony brought  20 people christmas day 20 people believe me it was a nice nice chunk of change and i'm incapable of 
[01:47:00]  leaving a lousy tip uh for some reason i don't know why i think my mother like put that instilled  that in me because she would waitress for so many years and uh i i left a nice tip nice nothing  was he there yes he was there dropped didn't even drop by the table i saw him when i walked in shook  his hand didn't even drop by the table you see that's what i need my own place hey frenchy ask how the

[01:48:00]  walking back to the table what that's what i got for uh for the cash that night having to self-serve  like buffet style drinks might as well just had a coke machine there uh free refills province on  mcdougall street it's a good place to go if you got eight hours to kill right for a snack yes and  you know what he deserves all the best at this room because i'm not putting my feet back there  that's for sure well when my brother opens his restaurant in i think two weeks there'll be a 
[01:48:30]  little something something for the done answer the show right why wouldn't you do you got to give him  a little something why wouldn't he come by and at least say hello to anthony come by see how everything  is going hey guys is everything fine thank you for the 20 people christmas thank you right  i don't believe he didn't go there i mean usually he does that i mean if i would have been there i  would have been there the whole time and taking sure well that's a problem too but uh you know just

[02:01:30]  patty and kyle cook spend every precious possible minute with their only child he knows that his life is  not going to be as long as everybody else's life being 13 years old is a very big wish and dream for  him he wants to be a teenager seth was only 18 months old when he retired  creepy keep believing in your gods really i'm a progeria kid looking to retire here in the united states 
[02:02:00]  seth has been dying for the same heart attack for six months  well there's a lot of questions that need to be answered  and if i see a baseball cap on the table i'll know we have a deal  i have veins in my head i never asked why

[02:08:30]  always it's got to go over that nose because their nose that skin gets so thin on there and  and you think the parents just burn you think the parents are cruel enough to make the kid go to  school yeah why they want to treat him like an ordinary school because parents are like let's just  now we'll treat him like an ordinary child gonna be a regular little kid they put a tent out back  he goes out for 10 minutes they say how was camp yeah everything's just 
[02:09:00]  everything better fly on by it's like the life of a gnat it's a mayfly is that the one  that just gets born and dies that day he was he was and he was never really a crier oh except for  the terrible tuesday remember the terrible tuesday terrible tuesday that's when you really got to watch  him god damn it this guy's got a great line we should have thought of mike in ohio mike yeah so this uh  well merry christmas first of all this uh pajuria kid is he out of diapers for what like three years

[02:10:00]  oh  oh  see i was getting high with my boys one day just kicking back hanging out in l.a when this dude drove  by in this really funky bass i could tell right away this motherfucker had his was a white dude about 
[02:10:30]  thirty something kept staring at me yelling like he wanted something he called me over and he asked  for directions i saw his dick was hard so i peeped his car i said you're dying you know you ain't lost  you want to suck my dick while i'm jacking you off and he said oh no there must be a mistake i got a  wife and a kid and i'm very very straight so i said take my number and my name you can call me up when you're  sick of playing games as i walked away yo i knew he would call because if you see one bag they can see them all  he won't say so what the fuck you think he needs so what the fuck you mean he won't say so if you 
[02:11:00]  see one bag now you'll see them all he won't say so what the fuck you need he needs so what the  fuck you think he won't because if you see one bag then you'll see them all so i knew that he'd be  climbing the water one week later and he finally called he said his family's going for a week or two  and he was really born and needed something to do so i told there it is gangsta fag it's sweeping  the nation we finally got to talk to gangsta fag what last week yes we did just giving you a piece  of the song because a uh an acoustic version of that song came in in the last week or so up to the 
[02:11:30]  who stick yeah to the the huge gangsta fag hit he wants it someone took it upon themselves to make  an acoustic version of that fine song a lot of controversy and rumors speculation and everything  about gangsta fag what do you mean and who he is what he's all about is he really uh what he says  he is you know all this uh speculation nothing to back it up uh i think he's so out there that it's 
[02:12:00]  just hard for people to comprehend this guy you know he's just a gay thug who can rap big fag  big black faggot he uh he was a lot of fun on the radio yeah i am the guy uh took no bunk from  anybody well what who's gonna give him bunk ah absolutely give him bunk he's gonna give you  spunk like he doesn't even threaten yeah he doesn't even threaten to just beat you up  like if some big like weight lifting looking muscle-bound black guy threatens to beat you up 
[02:12:30]  you're not gonna do uh something that will piss him off right he threatens to beat you up but after  you're down on the ground and all beat up he's gonna fuck you in the ass ah even worse even worse  now it's even worse while he's fucking he goes that's called an attention getter an attention getter  well let me tell you what knocking people out fucking him in the ass 
[02:13:00]  so let me tell you what happened uh my pants fell off i hope his big black cock was in him  you sounded a lot gayer on the radio let me tell you what happened so ryan one of our fans took uh  he wants it by gangster fag and made an acoustic version yes and then detox from whack bag took ryan's  acoustic version and added a few more instruments you follow yes so ryan came up with the acoustic 
[02:13:30]  version of uh he wants it by gangster fag and then detox even uh made it better by adding uh some stuff  into it and now it's like a remix i cannot wait to hear this bit of fag gum so this is that same  song done acoustically this gayness  i was getting high with my boys one day just kicking back hanging out in l.a when this dude drove by in 
[02:14:00]  this really funky bands i could tell right away this motherfucker had ends it was a white dude about  thirty something kept staring at me like he wanted something he called me over he asked me for directions  i saw his dick was hard so i peaked his car i said you're lying you know you ain't lost you want to suck  my dick while i'm jacking you off he said oh no there must be a mistake i got a wife a kid i'm very very  straight so i said take my number take my name you can call me up when you're sick of playing games and 
[02:14:30]  i walked away i knew we were caught when you've seen one bag you've seen them all  so i knew he'd be climbing the walls one week later he finally called said his family was gone for a week or two  he was really important he needed something to do so i drove up to his crib up in beverly hills 
[02:15:00]  a farm ass house with a couple of meals he said he wasn't gay he just wanted to chat then a half  hour later he's massaging my back in his wife's room he gave me some head went to the next room  fucked on his kids bed bugs always fucked like bitches in heat i came on his face and all over the sheets 
[02:15:30]  i knew i was done when i started getting soft i grabbed the kid's toy and i wrapped my dick off  he's lying on the bed still trying to recover i pushed him out the door and my car's born in rubber  so what the fuck you don't say so what the fuck you need when you see one's a bag you can see in my heart  so what the fuck you don't say so what the fuck you need when you see one's a bag you can see in my heart 
[02:16:00]  so  he just couldn't pass up through all that week i'm tearing that ass up cause he loves to ride him  he loves to suck him after i was done i let my homeboys fuck him now his phone can't cause me  every single day i told him i was through he told me that he pays so not twice a week i'm getting paid to 
[02:16:30]  what's happening baby with the cash and the fees i'll slap him one month later the cap is out the  bag oh this motherfucker starts pressing and drag i did my thing i had my phone with him but it's time  to cut him off because i'm done with him he's crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg  his arm on the ground holding under my leg screaming don't leave please twist the g what you get when you  fuck with me 
[02:17:00]  so what the fuck you don't say so what the fuck you need when you see one's a bag you can see in my  heart so what the fuck you think so what the fuck you need when you see one's a bag you can see in my  it certainly changes the feel of the song i'm not as scary i like the blues traveler feel to it 
[02:17:30]  yeah yeah when the harmonica came in it was definitely a blues traveler feel  that sounds like the closing credit song to broke back mountain more than like a scary i'm gonna rape  your song it reminds me of brother joe's up in here song yeah has that same type of thing true  want to thank ryan he put that together and then detox from whack bag took it and made it even stronger  so fabulous listen i know there's a lot of rumors about gangster fag uh rogan i don't know if joe knows 
[02:18:00]  him but i'll talk to joe when i'm back in la i'm gonna try to meet gangster fag oh um because i will  be out there for three weeks and i will try to have a photo with gangster fag by the time i get back  well and we'll work on it look what uh jimmy's willing to do for the show i know you you better be  nice first time he's ever wanted to go out of his way to help the show that's uh it's it's it's quite  a nice thing you're doing jimmy don't say anything bad to him don't uh don't gay bash with 
[02:18:30]  red and redneck friends and then leave the back door of the bar because he'll be out there with his  buddies and they'll fuck yous all that's right but hopes hold me hopes implying let me just see if i  understand this yeah i'm trying to be helpful and dispel rumors well we're not used to you being  helpful that's all that's all i'm trying to say jimmy but i mean if you want to look into it further  that's uh just your little brain working over time i just want to be helpful to the radio program i  understand i want to have i figure we could take like maybe him in a vest or maybe uh you know picking  me up just to show how big he is how small i am oh wouldn't that be cute yeah like your arms around 
[02:19:00]  each other you know just kind of pointing you know a couple of men you know he would have sex with you  then they wouldn't he if he's picking you up he couldn't resist but it's not gay because jimmy's  actually going to be jimmy robinson when uh i'll have my cape on when he meets gangsta fag jimmy  robinson i used to picture jimmy robinson with his cape riding his little tricycle by that was jimmy  robinson but anyway i will try to maybe through rogan well you make that work that's very nice make  it work make it happen and i you know what as a matter of fact this is how secure i am all right 
[02:19:30]  gangster fag look at him i show him this i go go ahead let's take a picture take a picture with  that oh well i get a supple delicious little backside that is hard to have to look at so  many times you know what's hard about it is that i know it's hard about it it's hard because you're  both looking at it going god that's awful jeez that's cute we uh it's awful but nice what you and

And we all thought you loved yourself.  But that couldn't have been the issue.  Oh, maybe they just sayin' that.  Now cost them a miss. 
[02:24:30]  You shit, a nigga tried to diss you.  That's why you're layin' on your back.  Lookin' at the roof of the church.  Preacher tellin' the truth.  And you know that it hurts.  And you know that it hurts.  Yeah.  Whoa, y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here.  Y'all gon' make me go all out, up in here, up in here.

Y'all gon' make me act to pull, up in here, up in here.  Oh, up in here, you'll make me lose my cool up in here.

[02:26:00]  Plugs more, Jimmy.  Jimmy's now holding his plugs up in front of the PalTalk camera.  I see that.  Ah, my friend's band.  Huh?  I got my little cell phone Christmas message from Sully.  Oh, very nice.  Did ye?  Yes.  My only real celebrity, like, rock star friend. 
[02:26:30]  That was the old Sully.  I haven't talked to him since he came to my show in Boston.  I haven't seen him in a while.  But I guess he's good.  He's a rock star.  A real rock star.  He hangs out with tens.  I can't find a disc.  What do you need, sweetie?  Oh, no, it's not okay.  No, it's all right.  It's all right.  Let's get Amon in here to see where he put us.  We're in casual mode.  No, I mean, it's not okay if you can't find it and you think it's somewhere.  It's all right.  We're just, you know.  Obsessing.  It's the end of the year, so everyone's starting their end of year best of crap.  You know, the best album of the year, the best movie of the year, 
[02:27:00]  and the biggest stories of the year, and blah, blah, blah.  Lists.  Sort of lists.  Want to kind of listen to some of that and comment on it.  Speaking of movies, though, real fast, Jimmy, you went and saw Kong?  Oh, yeah.  I got to say, I went on Christmas Eve night to the 11 o'clock showing, and I loved it.  I fucking loved King Kong.  You loved King Kong.  You didn't think some of the action scenes were too long?  Not the action scenes. 
[02:27:30]  I thought some of the story was unnecessary.  There was a couple of relationships they got into story-wise I didn't care about.  You didn't like when she was juggling the rocks for Kong?  I really wanted him to squash her.  There was a couple of things.  I thought she was good.  I did not like Jack Black in it.  I didn't think he was awful.  Jack Black, though.  He doesn't stink.  Who would you have rather seen?  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Yeah.  Would have been great.  You don't like Jack Black, though?  He was okay.  He wasn't bad.  I just think that, like...  You want to kiss me? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You want a more seasoned guy, because, like, Adrian Brody was fantastic.  Naomi Watts is great.  Yeah.  And the ape was fucking...  The Empire State stuff, I'm so afraid of heights.  My palms were sweating.  That was so well shot.  It's like, you know, it's just great, man.  I loved King Kong.  Loved it.  When he's fighting the thing.  The thing.  The monster.  Did you notice, like, a couple of those action scenes, though, looked like they were just  running in front of a screen?  A couple.  That was weird.  A couple did.  Because then some of the action scenes were unbelievable. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, I think some of them, they had trouble pulling off.  But they...  It's like, the worst ones here was still, like, the best you were going to get 25 years ago.  Yeah.  Like, you know what I mean?  They still did an amazing job, and, like, a couple of, like, the ape's face was so, like,  real looking, and it was really great, man.  Yeah.  Was it sad?  I thought so, yeah.  Yeah.  No, but it wasn't some love thing.  Did you cry, Jimmy?  Nah, but I kind of felt choked up.  Did you hear the sniffling behind you?  When I went, I went one of the first days that it was open, so the theater was ridiculously 
[02:29:00]  packed, and there were people crying all around me.  See, I didn't hear that.  Like, what?  What I heard was the other ape on a cell phone.  That was what I heard.  And it was the first...  I was getting so angry at this guy on a cell phone, and I was...  I was almost physically jumped up and said something.  I was, like, in a rage.  Almost.  Almost.  What kept you from saying something?  The fact that I liked teeth.  Yeah.  And I knew the dude, and I swear to God, I saw this fucking guy in the lobby.  No exaggeration, he was 6'8". 
[02:29:30]  And you knew there was going to be a problem.  No.  I'm glad I shut my mouth.  Like, I didn't see him until after the movie.  And I'm like, that's the guy I almost jumped up and scolded, and he would have fucking shoved  his cell phone down my throat like that boyfriend did to that chick somewhere.  Made her swallow the cell phone.  Yeah.  So I love the movie.  I recommend it.  In fact, you're right there in one of the rows.  Yeah.  You haven't seen Kong yet?  No.  I've got to get to the movies.  I went and saw The Ringer. 
[02:30:00]  Which one's that?  The Johnny Knoxville movie.  The retards.  Hollywood.  Oh, the retards.  Hollywood has got to stop wimping out.  He makes believe he's a retard to go on the Special Olympics.  Yeah, he wants to fix the Special Olympics because he needs cash.  Not to give the whole story away, whatever.  And then his uncle has a gambling debt, so they come up with a scheme that he's going to  join the Special Olympics and win the whole thing because there's prizes and all that  associated with it.  Sounds like a great concept.  The movie was eh at best. 
[02:30:30]  Let me tell you.  And the Special Olympics got involved with the movie and actually approved the script and  the movie itself.  Can I guess?  Now, I swear to you, I have no clue what this is about or anything.  But can I guess, because it's got to be a nice, politically correct movie, what happens?  Yeah, go ahead.  Even though he's a normal guy, and it should be a given that this motherfucker should win  everything, the retarded people prevail. 
[02:31:00]  Sort of?  Yeah, sort of.  He realizes he's not as good as some of these people.  Right.  That's not as good, thinking it's going to be a breeze.  Well, there's this black retard that wins it every year, and the rest of the retards,  the special people, don't really like this guy, the black kid.  Really?  Because he's very cocky, and he drives around in a limo, and he has people on cell phones  because they're getting him commercials and endorsements.  He's getting endorsement deals? 
[02:31:30]  And all that.  So, you know, it makes you not like that special person in the movie.  So, in a way, it's like, all right, it would be cool if Johnny Knoxville does beat this guy,  but it turns out he's a really good athlete, even though he's a little slow.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Could have been a great movie.  And I was thinking to myself, Hollywood just doesn't make great comedies anymore because  they don't want to offend anybody.  They're awful.  Nope.  And I was trying to remember, what was the last, like, comedy that came out that was great?  I'm not talking about-  Horse Feathers. 
[02:32:00]  The Marx Brothers.  They have the racers.  Something about Mary.  Maybe go back that far.  I'm talking about a movie that was just laugh out loud, funny the whole way.  I thought that was.  They didn't give a shit about who they offended.  I'd say something about Mary.  It was a pretty brutal movie.  They made fun of retarded people.  Yeah, true.  She got this fucking load in her hair.  Right.  His dick gets bitten by a dog.  I mean, there's, like, some pretty rough shit.  There's a scene in The Ringer where this waitress comes over, and she's acting.  It takes you completely out of the movie. 
[02:32:30]  She's beyond unbelievably bad.  It was unwatchable.  Like, what?  All of a sudden, you're not in the movie anymore.  You're like, that is the worst acting I've ever seen on screen.  There was a.  Oh, man, what a set of tits.  There's a show on over the weekend, and we got to get it on.  We got to tape it so we can play some clips.  I only caught.  I caught it at the halfway mark.  It's retarded people putting on a production of The Wizard of Oz. 
[02:33:00]  All retarded cast.  What, do they all want a brain?  I know.  I guess it goes.  Dan, you saw some of this, right?  The retarded people doing The Wizard of Oz.  Yeah, I only saw as much as you did.  Yeah, you saw about as much as me.  Now, the beginning of it, I would gather.  Wait, really fast.  What character wanted a brain in The Wizard of Oz? 
[02:33:30]  The Scarecrow.  The Scarecrow.  Yeah.  The Scarecrow was, well, all I saw, we came in at the beginning, in the middle,  so I'm not sure how they picked the parts, and I was a little disappointed  because apparently they didn't get the rights to the music for this documentary,  so any time they break in a song, you just see them singing,  but they put some other music to it.  It's ridiculous.  You don't want to see them singing, you know.  If I only had a band. 
[02:34:00]  Ding, dong, my future's dead.  The one part that had me howling, though, is the Tin Man.  Yeah.  The Tin Man is played by a retarded black guy with these huge Coke bottle glasses,  and he's handicapped, so he's in a wheelchair.  Now, in order to have him move around inconspicuously, he's being pushed by someone in a tree costume. 
[02:34:30]  So there's a tree pushing a retarded black tin man around, and he just holds an axe limply in his lap.  What station was this on?  We've got to get this.  Oh, it was one of those.  Cinemax.  Cinemax or something?  Yeah, it re-airs January 2nd.  January 2nd, we will tape the whole thing.  And Dorothy and all of them.  The lack of any emotion. 
[02:35:00]  What was the dog's name?  Was it Dodo?  Oh, I want to go back to Kansas.  What happened?  Did a storm take you away?  No, I'm just too fucking stupid to remember how to get back to Kansas.  It's right there.  By the sign that says, welcome to Kansas, you idiot.  The brick road is only yellow because stupid tinkled in his pants again? 
[02:35:30]  Follow the yellow brick, shoe tops.  They had the munchkins, little munchkin retards, all the characters, all the costumes.  And they were so, all of them, so completely devoid of emotion. 
[02:36:00]  Like, their acting was, not that they should be Olivier, believe me, but their acting is  just like, we have to go see the wizard.  What are we going to do?  I don't know.  I don't have a brain.  The wizard will get you a brain.  Follow me.  That's the whole thing from what I saw as far as their acting chops went.  One was going, oh, maybe we'll get to the end of the goings with the wizard. 
[02:36:30]  I'll get you some cards.  I'm going to go get another thing.  But the teacher talked about how much progress they had made, so we can only assume that the  first half.  Yeah.  Yeah, the teacher is like, I'm amazed at the progress they have made up to this point,  and we're halfway through.  They're already through dress rehearsals and stuff.  I want to see from the beginning how they pick, how they chose.  No, this one isn't functional enough to be in it.  You've got to be a fucking tree that pushes the wheelchair.  You, you're the tin man.  What's a retarded tree look like? 
[02:37:00]  The roots are on top.  The apples are by its feet.  You've got to see the whole thing.  Oh, I really want to see the retarded Wizard of Oz.  January 2nd?  We'll have to take that one.  Hey, we have...  Pay no attention to that man underneath the shemp wig. 
[02:37:30]  Do they have the scene of the witch melting and stuff?  Yeah, it's the entire show.  The entire show.  Where the kid is screaming, I'm melting, I'm melting.  Yeah.  Somebody throws him a book.  I'm melting.  So is your DNA, you sappy bastard.  Are you a good witch or a bad witch?  I'm a fucking retarded witch.  Guys...  Which one is that?  It's amazing.  When you do a national talk show, we have one of the actors that actually was part of 
[02:38:00]  this production.  Wow.  Hi, who's this?  It's me again.  Way to say.  And you were in this production of The Wizard of Oz?  No, I was not in the production of The Wizard of Oz.  No sense of direction.  I'm the wicked witch of that way.  A fucking big Down syndrome head falls out of the sky and crushes the evil witch.  Oh, and she just talks over you.  No, I don't. 
[02:38:30]  Here's some tape of the production.  Go ahead.  Yeah, so just talk.  That's what it sounded like.  Can you sing a song from The Wizard of Oz?  I would like to see that.  Shut your mouth.  Can you sing something like, let me ding dong, my liver's dead?  Ding dong, my husband's dead.  My husband's dead.  A choo-choo train went through his head.  Ding dong, the crossing didn't come down.  Be nice now. 
[02:39:00]  They should have had the Pojuria kids play the monkeys.  In this production of The Wizard of Oz.  Where's the show playing at?  Toot, toot, the train is coming.  Where's the show playing at?  Better watch out.  My husband ain't running.  Toot, toot.  Uh, excuse me.  Uh, yes?  No, it wasn't my husband.  Yes, it was your husband.  Lady Di's husband, by the way, people, got hit by a train.  That's right.  No.  Yeah.  All right, Lady Di, hold on. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, come on.  We'll get to the bottom.  Yeah, hold on for two seconds.  Thanks for going with the bit, by the way, you stupid twat.  Good job.  She really is radio-led.  All right, so we'll get that.  Yeah.  Getting back to The Ringer, by the way, really fascinating observation.  They had special people acting in this movie.  Oh, see?  They had to have the real special people.  Yeah.  Like Life Goes On with Corky.  Yeah, yeah.  They were all Life Goes On type of actors.  And, uh, and, uh, yeah, like I said, the Special Olympics actually endorsed this movie. 
[02:40:00]  That's when you know, oh, great, I'm in for a treat.  Uh-huh.  And then, but this is the observation, then they had regular actors playing special people.  Uh-oh.  And you're like, you weren't really sure which ones, some were very obvious, that's a special  person, that's an actor.  But then there were the ones that you weren't really sure.  Yeah.  It's got to be a hell of a, um, audition for an actor in Hollywood, you know?  Play a retard.  You're going to be in this movie because we think you look like a retard. 
[02:40:30]  Got to be the easiest role, though, to do.  Got to be the easiest role.  Let's go to Mike.  You just, eh.  Every time Eric, every time Eric Logan will walk by the office, they're like, you, the  hair is perfect.  Get in here.  What?  No, I'm just trying to make a deal with your company and XM.  Jesus.  We can't leave you alone.  Right.  Yeah, I just want you to put these into every new Down Syndrome head that comes out.  I want it to be XM-friendly.  They're handing him a track suit and a, a track, a track suit and a, uh, some Nikes.  He's, Jesus, I fucked that up. 
[02:41:00]  It was so good, too, in my mind.  Mike on Long Island.  Hey, what's going on?  Thanks for giving me a second try, by the way.  I really appreciate that.  Hey, did the Tin Man, instead of the, like, oil funnel can hat, did he have, like, a spray-painted  silver hockey helmet on?  It was really bad because they tried to put this silver paint on his black face and it  just didn't work.  It didn't work.  Yeah.  The black just came through.  It always does. 
[02:41:30]  Like a shine.  And then at the end, God, I wish I could remember his, it was like the closing line.  Uh, they were, they were, uh, getting lines from all these people and the Tin Man is sitting  in the dressing room in the back in his little tin suit with his axe and his huge thick glasses.  And he said something like, oh yeah, it was, and he's had those fucked up retard teeth that  almost come straight out of their face.  Like, they're, they're, they're not straight down like people's teeth. 
[02:42:00]  They grow out.  All open garage door teeth.  I don't understand that, I mean, you can still see a freaking dentist.  Big tongue car driving out of the garage.  Blah!  Blah!  Oh, it was horrible.  And, and, and he said something about his name and then he goes, I, I, I, I don't care 
[02:42:30]  what they call me.  Just don't call me late for dinner.  Uh, and yeah.  And then he puts his head kind of down and sideways and stares off with his blank stare and the  camera wouldn't go off of it.  And it's slowly faded with, you could hear the crickets chirping.  Like no one's laughing at that joke and they wouldn't get off of his stupid face.  Speaking of, um, jokes, getting back to the ringer, we're, we're talking about two things 
[02:43:00]  here.  You know, hopefully you guys have figured that out.  The Johnny Knoxville movie and this Wizard of Oz thing that some special people put on  for Cinemax or whatever it was.  Um, you know that joke that, uh, Club Soda Kenny tells about, uh, the Chinese guy and the  toothache.  Yeah.  Two 30.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of the special people in the, in the movie, the ringer told that joke.  I howled so fucking hard because that's that joke.  Sidecar Kenny tells all the time and is so proud of it.  I'm like, Oh my God. 
[02:43:30]  Two 30.  Yeah.  A special person in this movie was told the same joke.  I laughed.  That was the biggest laugh I had because I was thinking of sidecar.  And it says, it's not the wizard.  It's the wizard.  It's just a guy that stands there and pisses himself.  Pay no attention to that man ruining the family photograph.  Brian in Virginia.  Hey, did Dorothy Quick and Ruby Red's leg braces together to get back to Kansas?  Oh my God. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  Listen.  All right.  Listen.  Listen here.  There's no place like home where they don't want you.  Oh, there's no, there's no, there's no, there's no, there's no place like Bellevue.  All right.  They click the heels together.  I have down syndrome.  I have down syndrome.  I have down syndrome. 
[02:44:30]  There's no place like Bellevue.  There's no place like Bellevue.  Also getting back to the ringer real fast.  You know the kids at Whitney High?  They were in the movie.  Yes.  They were in the movie.  Oh, were they?  They were in the movie.  That is adorable.  And did a little number for everybody.  Did they?  You know what that's all about, right?  The kids at Whitney High.  It's school kids.  They're all special children and they sing songs.  Right.  They sang the insect song. 
[02:45:00]  You better watch out or the insects will get you.  Yeah, we could play that for everybody today.  They have a website and they have CDs.  Although my favorite more than that is the song from Dirty Dancing.  Oh, time of their life.  That's not the kids from Whitley or Whitney High.  Oh, you want to do that one?  But that song is too goddamn funny.  All right.  We can end the break with that.  Yeah, this was two special people at Great Adventure.  You ever see those places you can go in and have a record made?  You sing to it like karaoke and they make a video and a record. 
[02:45:30]  Well, one of the counselors that took these retarded kids on a field trip had the common sense to realize how hysterically funny this is and put it out on the Internet.  I want to think, what was the big song Dorothy sang?  Somewhere, where did my brain go?  Oh, I want to think, what was the big song that I was talking about?  You.  We interrupt this program to bring you home. 
[02:46:00]  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Who saw this coming?  Ooh.  George in Colorado.  George.  Yes, gentlemen.  I have a midget sighting for you.  Yes.  Saturday night, my wife and I went to midnight mass.  As we were walking in, this van pulled up and these four midgets got out of this van and started walking in the church in front of us.  I was rolling on the ground laughing.  Why were midgets walking into church unless it's to curse God and walk out? 
[02:46:30]  I don't know.  Well, I was just, I mean, they were all dressed in their Christmas finest and I come walking up and my wife tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to them and I was, I mean, she turned around and she said, you're embarrassing me because I was on the ground laughing.  Oh, man.  It was hilarious.  Jimmy's on fire today.  Holy shit.  My chromosomes are all wrong.  My chromosomes are all wrong.  Meanwhile, back at the show. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, that's really funny.  Speaking of special people, hello, who's this?  It's me again.  Hey.  What's up?  What do you got for the show?  How's it going?  What do you got for the show?  You want to ask me a question?  Yeah, what do you got for the show today?  What do you got for the show?  What do I have for the show today?  What do you got for the show?  She asks.  I told you. 
[02:47:30]  I wished you happy holidays and everything.  Great.  Call me at home.  You want me to call you at home?  Give her the number.  Give me the phone number.  Absolutely not.  No.  Do you realize we're doing a talk show?  You don't call a talk show just to wish you a happy new year.  We're trying to get real shit done here.  Okay.  What would you like to get done?  I'd like to see you die.  No.  That ain't going to happen.  I'm going to live for a long time.  That's going to be a treat for everyone, too.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  I'm just going to sit back and enjoy this.  But anyway, I have a new location right now.  I still work in Westfield.  Uh-huh.  But I live in Elizabeth.  That's fascinating.  And that's why you called the fucking radio show?  No.  What else?  This is why the satellite radio show is so much better than our commercial radio show.  Because we finally woke up one day and got rid of all this dead weight.  No.  You have nothing.  You're calling.  What about Saka Patty?  Doesn't she come around?  She still has something offered to the show. 
[02:48:30]  You have nothing.  You're calling to say happy new year.  We just can't come.  And you've been on hold for an hour.  You have no money.  And you've got a prepaid phone card that you just wasted to say happy new year.  No, I did not.  No, I'm calling from a regular phone.  If you had anything to offer, your husband wouldn't have gotten a New Jersey transit tattoo on his face.  My husband wouldn't have got what?  I'm not even married anymore.  No shit, Sherlock.  You can't be married to a corpse.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:49:00]  No, no, no.  That is not nice.  Come on.  That's true.  That's true.  No, it's not.  Uh-huh.  Did you have some kind of flashback when you heard transit strike?  Oh, man.  There you go with that.  I meant a whole different thing to you, didn't I?  Bet you're not going to see Corpse Bride.  Oh.  No.  Is that the name of the movie?  What?  Oh, forget it.  Would you say your marriage was right on track or was there a problem?  Excuse me?  Was that the question you wanted to ask me? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No.  First of all, I was not married to my son's dad.  First of all, what did you get your son for Christmas?  I got my son a lot of things for Christmas.  A lot of things.  Name the best thing that he got.  From his mom.  Well, he got souvenir cards.  From you?  What?  Yes.  What are those?  And, you know, and...  What are those?  The things you buy in the gas station, like in a Hess?  No.  Oh, a Hess truck?  No.  Not a Hess truck.  What are those things?  No, he had plenty of those.  What did you get your son? 
[02:50:00]  What did you get him?  That you barely see because you're an alcoholic.  And you're a horrible mother.  What do you think I'm an alcoholic?  Your son doesn't live with you.  What did you get your son for Christmas?  I got my...  I told you what I got my son.  I got him souvenir...  You know, souvenir cards and stuff like that.  Please send his address so we can give him a real Christmas.  What is a souvenir car?  What is a souvenir car?  What is a souvenir car?  What's a souvenir car?  I don't even know what that is.  I don't know what Hot Wheels are.  You got your ex a souvenir train.  Old-fashioned cars.  Old-fashioned cars. 
[02:50:30]  How old's your kid?  My kid is 15.  That's what he wants.  Yeah, he didn't want a PSP.  What, he's got a kid that has everything?  A PSP.  What, he's got everything?  Or maybe his first iPod.  Why, he's rich?  Or his irresponsible and drunk mother can't afford this shit.  He doesn't have everything.  Wait, hold on one second.  You're piss poor.  Hold on one second.  Okay, first of all, I no longer live in Westfield.  You said that.  That's too expensive for me.  Do you live with your son? 
[02:51:00]  No, I do not.  Still not.  How about you stop calling our show and call your son?  How long?  Stop drinking.  I call my son all the time.  Stop drinking so maybe you can give him a real Christmas one day.  I call him all the time and I gave him a real Christmas for so many years and he still has real Christmases.  No, he doesn't.  His mom got him fucking awful souvenir cars.  Oh, come on.  You know what the best?  You don't know what else I got him.  The best present you could give him is to stand on the path tracks.  Exactly.  Just like dear old dad.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Choo-choo. 
[02:51:30]  Goodbye.  I'll talk to you later.  What else did you get him?  Hold on.  The souvenir cars and what else?  The souvenir cars and whatever else I'm going to get him.  Going to get him.  Going to get him.  I hope you're fucking Jewish.  Look, look.  How much did you spend?  How much were the souvenir cars, Lady Di?  How much were they?  How much were the souvenir cars?  Yes, ask me the question again and then give me.  How much is quite a bit.  How much?  How much?  A couple hundred dollars.  You're lying.  I'm not.  You're lying. 
[02:52:00]  You're lying through your tequila worm.  What do you want me to tell you?  I hope.  The truth.  He lives with your dad.  I hope he at least gave him some good gifts.  Yes, he did.  Well, that's good.  So you said you gave him a lot of stuff.  You gave him a souvenir car, which probably cost you 30 bucks.  He lives with fake dad, not real dad.  No, no, no.  He lives with my father.  No, Lady Di's father.  He lives with my father.  Oh, right.  He lives with his grandfather.  Yeah, with grandpa.  Right.  And what else are you going to get him when you're not spending money on booze?  Huh?  What else are you going to get him when you're not spending money on booze?  Excuse me, I'm not spending any money on booze. 
[02:52:30]  Yes, you are.  I cannot afford that right now.  Yeah, exactly.  Believe me, I can't do it right now.  What kind of job do you have?  She's a waitress.  Dunkin' Donuts.  I'm going there in a little bit.  Who are you, the guy in the commercial?  I'm not in the guy.  I bet you you've wrapped up a box of your son's favorite donuts for Christmas.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Here's six crullers and six Boston creams.  Oh.  I wish I could have gave you more this Christmas, but I'm so irresponsible.  But, you know, booze is expensive. 
[02:53:00]  And I had to feed my fat face with alcohol.  No, I do not.  I don't do that anymore.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  You're lying.  What do you mean I'm lying?  Did you get help like we asked you to?  No.  Yes, I am getting help.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm still working.  See, you made this our...  And people are going, wow, you're being pretty brutal to this woman.  She made this our problem.  Lady Di?  Lady Di?  What? 
[02:53:30]  Hello?  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's what you should have done in a box, and your son could have opened it.  Listen, I have...  What kind of help are you getting for your alcoholism?  Well, whatever help I can get right now.  I go to meetings.  I have to do what I have to do.  When's the last time you had a drink, and don't lie?  The last time I had a drink?  Yeah, for real.  I don't know, about a month ago.  That's such a lie.  Oh, lie.  Lie.  Tell us differently.  Now I'm lying to you.  Lady lie.  No.  No, no, no.  Lady Di.  Not really lying.  Lady Di is doing a brand new dance now. 
[02:54:00]  Come on, lady.  Kiss a locomotive.  Stop it, lady.  Oh, my goodness.  I gotta do what I gotta do.  What does that mean?  Stop with your vagaries.  I gotta do what I gotta do.  Exactly.  Do you really think that's an easy thing to do?  What?  What?  Stand in front of a train?  What's for your husband?  No, no, no.  Forget about the front of a train.  You know, don't mention that, first of all.  All right, all right. 
[02:54:30]  Enough, Ray.  Sorry.  She's got such comedic value.  Enough.  All right, you know, I mean, don't even talk about that.  How many boxes was he buried in?  Excuse me?  So what, what, um, what you said you gotta do what you gotta do.  What do you have to do?  I have to get myself together.  Did they have to get myself together?  I know what I have to do.  Now I've been saying that for years and years, and your son is growing up.  You have a responsibility.  You made this our fucking problem, and you do nothing about it. 
[02:55:00]  Well, how do you know I don't do anything about it?  We were talking to you.  You, you're, you're working at Dunkin' Donuts.  Apparently her husband went to pieces before and after the train.  All right, enough with the train.  Right, enough with the train, I know.  I agree.  I agree.  That is, that is a bad thing to talk about.  I understand.  Okay.  So do you feel like, I mean, are you getting yourself, are you getting yourself together?  Are you picking up the pieces?  I'm trying to.  Are you? 
[02:55:30]  Yes, I am.  Good.  I mean, it's not an easy thing to do.  I like to see people get their life on track.  What's that?  It's not an easy thing to do.  Well, are you working full time at Dunkin' Donuts, or do they have you like in training?  Seven straight days a week.  You have, you're done with your training?  I'm done with my training.  I never even had to get trained over there.  Oh, no?  Why didn't you, why didn't you have to get trained?  Because as soon as, two days later, I do the job right away.  Really?  Yeah.  Marion. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, hi.  How you guys doing?  Happy Monday.  Oh, my goodness.  Is Lady Di getting better?  Yeah.  Well, didn't, didn't I tell you?  Lady Di, don't wait.  Marion.  She's doing really good.  Marion, when's the last time she drank and Di don't say anything?  I don't remember.  What do you think?  It's been a while.  How long?  Maybe over a month.  All right.  I say Christmas.  Over a month.  No, no, no.  Not Christmas, Anthony.  No, you didn't, Diane.  You didn't have anything for Christmas because you were working and I was with you Christmas.  Right. 
[02:56:30]  All right.  And did she get her son nice things for Christmas?  Or at least try?  Well, she didn't see him.  I understand people don't have money out there, but she didn't see her son for Christmas.  No, because she was working and she had to go to work and she had to work.  What time did she have to work on Christmas?  She had to work until 6 or 7 o'clock.  What time?  What were her actual hours on Christmas Day?  12 to 5.  12 noon to 5 in the afternoon?  Right.  Five hours and you couldn't see your fucking son in five hours you had to work? 
[02:57:00]  Anthony.  I know a lot of people that had to work Christmas and they still, like, enjoy some part of the holiday.  No, she wanted to see him last week before Christmas.  Christmas Day you worked five hours.  All right.  The other 19 hours.  She had no way of getting to where he is.  Really?  Yeah.  I did not.  How far away is he?  Take the train.  Take the train.  There's no buses or no trains that go to where her dad lives.  Why didn't... 
[02:57:30]  Dad's got to be the smartest person this week.  I couldn't pick her up because I was with my family on Christmas.  No one could.  On Christmas.  You can bulldoze it, perhaps.  Excuse me.  Maybe a forklet.  I was with my husband and my family.  So how are you guys doing?  All right.  Listen.  We're good.  You don't call us to say how you're doing.  You call us because I have something...  We're not on a tiny little city anymore.  Right.  Our city is American now.  We don't have time for your bullshit.  I wanted to call you guys on Friday, but Friday there was nobody there. 
[02:58:00]  Well, Di, it sounds like you're just, you know, full steam ahead.  He's there.  Okay, yeah.  I've got to go to work.  Picking up the pieces.  That's great.  Picking up the pieces of your broken life.  Like the little train that could.  You know, you saw that mountain.  There we go with the train again.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was just making an analogy to a child's story.  Perhaps you read one to your son once in a while.  Why bring up the happiest day of your husband's life?  Excuse me.  Di, do you say to yourself...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Listen to me.  When you're going to work, do you say, I know I can, I know I can, I know I can? 
[02:58:30]  First of all, I was not married to my son's father.  Uh-huh.  Okay, and second of all, he was not my husband.  Right.  That would be the first of all...  And third of all, it's a very sad situation.  What happened?  Very sad.  What happened?  What happened?  Getting inside, what happened?  Finally, let's get some closure on this.  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened?  Now you're giving us good radio.  What happened?  Come on.  What happened that fateful day?  That's right.  What happened that fateful day?  Yes.  What happened that glorious day? 
[02:59:00]  I had to see myself.  Huh?  What happened?  Guys, let's not bring up the past.  Hey, Marion, you keep out of this.  Marion, go fuck yourself.  This is the new show.  Marion.  No, no, no.  Opie, Opie.  You keep out of this.  That's right.  Opie.  Lady Di, now share.  Lady Di.  We all talk about our lives on the show.  Right.  That's our whole job.  Our personal lives.  This is my son we're talking about.  I don't want to talk about.  Your son doesn't have satellite radio.  Yeah.  You can't get this show on a piece of shit car that you've got for Christmas. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, you stupid bitch.  I talked about everything, so shut up.  Now it's Lady Di's turn.  Now, Lady Di, tell us what happened that day. 
[03:00:00]  That's nobody's business.  Lady Di, what happened?  We're not even sure what happened.  Lady Di.  Stop jumping in.  Lady Di, give us something for once.  What happened that day?  Marion, you're a good story blocker.  Yeah, you've got to dump Marion off the phone.  She keeps you interrupting.  Yep.  Bye-bye.  Now, Lady Di, tell us what happened that day.  I told you what happened that day.  No, tell us what happened the day that that happened with the train.  He was depressed.  And that's what he did.  All right. 
[03:00:30]  Now, a little more detail.  He was depressed about...  But I wasn't there.  What was he depressed about?  I don't know, because I wasn't there.  And what day was this?  What year?  2001.  2001.  He's depressed.  He's depressed.  What train line was it?  I guess it was an Amtrak.  I don't know.  What exactly did he do?  We have a lot of new listeners that don't know you, and they don't know the story.  Just, I mean, you know, obviously it's not pleasant.  But what exactly did he do?  Well, what he did was he committed suicide, and he went in front of a train. 
[03:01:00]  Okay.  Now, was it in a...  Now, I don't think that's funny.  Was it standing there, or was it in a car?  I wasn't there.  I don't know.  But you know, yes, you do know exactly how it happened.  Was it in a car?  I don't think so.  Or was he just standing on the tracks?  Did he put his head on the rail?  I was not there.  I have no idea.  You know the details, though. 
[03:01:30]  But I know I wasn't there.  You heard from people.  I heard...  I wasn't there.  But you heard from people.  Of course you weren't there.  Only he was there on the train.  And the poor conductor.  Anthony, please.  I had a look at that look of satisfaction on his face, knowing that he didn't have to deal with you anymore.  Excuse me?  He wasn't dealing with me already a couple years.  Oh, yeah.  A few years.  We were broken up since 91.  No.  He was broken up the second that train hit him.  I have no idea.  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Okay, so I really don't know.  I don't know what to tell you about that.  What do you do?  Stand back to the train and wonder when it's going to hit you, or you just watch it coming?  Why do you guys got to bring up this?  Why do you guys can't turn around and ask her how she's doing otherwise?  Because it's fascinating.  No one wants to hear us ask her how you're doing.  But why don't you ask her how her doing?  That's how we got to where we are today.  Hey, everyone, just call in and we'll ask you how you're doing.  Because her holiday stunk.  How was her holiday?  She neglected her child and worked at Dunkin' Donuts.  It was successful. 
[03:02:30]  That's a good damn job that she's at because she gets along good with everybody that she  works with.  Listen, stop sticking up for her.  They're all fatties that like donuts just like her.  That's wonderful.  Homeless people get along with each other, too.  Yeah, well, yeah.  And a lot of other people get along just like drug addicts and alcoholics.  And you guys should know about alcoholics.  Come on.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen, the ringer tongue.  You've done that, too.  I do understand alcoholics.  And I think if she's trying to help herself, that's fine.  Good.  And she's doing good.  She's doing very good. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  All right.  Could you go away now, please?  Me and my husband are helping her out.  She's doing very good.  Well, there you go.  If that's real, then that sounds great.  All right.  Can we go now?  You guys.  Oh, and I have to go right now.  Because I'm saying, like, happy holidays.  What's been going on?  You know, we haven't seen you guys since October.  Okay.  No, you're right.  Let's do that.  Hey, happy holidays.  What's been going on?  We haven't seen you.  Yeah, what is going on?  Hey, Tim, I hear you're big in California, Tim.  What are we doing?  Favorite Letterman now, or what? 
[03:03:30]  No, Jay Leno.  Jay Leno.  I don't know.  I'll stay up that late on what he shows.  He was on Jay Leno.  See, here's the fascinating radio.  I mean, you know, yeah, it is fascinating radio.  This is just that, you know, you don't bring up people's past lives.  Come on.  Okay.  We asked you how you're doing.  Okay, we did what you said.  How you doing?  What's going on?  Your turn.  Good, good, good.  Everything is good here.  Everything is good with Diane.  Diane is doing really good.  All right, Marion.  Now I'm going to get into your head, because you seem to be the smart one out of the two 
[03:04:00]  dummies.  All right, listen.  Wait a minute.  I'm smart, too.  No, you're not.  You're a dumb motherfucker.  Smart.  Marion.  Marion.  Now, we just played it your way.  We asked you how you're doing and all that.  Explain to me why that's interesting to hear on a radio.  Because you know what?  Explain to me why that's interesting radio.  I've been doing this a long time.  Maybe I'll learn something from you.  Does anybody ever call you and ask you how Sandy's doing?  Oh, boy.  There's no oh, boys.  I've already discussed that. 
[03:04:30]  It's over and done with a long time ago.  We went over that whole fucking thing.  That's the same thing with Diane.  It's over and done with, okay?  Answer my question.  Why is that an interesting radio?  Because, you know...  To just say how you're doing and what have you been up to?  What...  That incident used to be married.  I mean, come on.  Nobody...  Please discuss that, too.  Holy fuck.  I have brought up the marriage thing.  And we're not talking about us, fuckstick.  We're talking about Di and something that happened in her life a while ago that is an interesting story. 
[03:05:00]  Well, look, I had a lot of things happen to me in my life.  Stop being selfish and answer the question.  You're not answering the question.  What's interesting about hi, how are you?  You said good, good, good.  My holiday was good.  Why don't you turn around and ask Diane besides her working at Dunkin' Donuts?  You didn't answer the question.  How is her alcohol?  Guys, you really got to...  Guys, guys, you got to leave the show alone.  You got to leave the show alone.  You bring nothing. 
[03:05:30]  You bring nothing to the table.  You contribute nothing.  Okay?  You got to leave the show alone.  You guys don't know everything and then all of a sudden they turn around and make fun of it?  And people are all over...  Oh, shut up.  That fucking...  You fucking cunt.  Cow's tongue and a human head is really bugging me.  Oh.  I don't know what to tell you.  With her 1940s football helmet hairdo.  It really is awful.  She looks like Marge Simpson, but fatter and not quite as sexy.  In honor of them and the discussion we had about The Wizard of Oz and the new Johnny Knoxville movie, The Ringer. 
[03:06:00]  Yes.  We got that song you want to hear.  Yeah, this is done at Great Adventure.  I think you set it up 20 minutes ago.  So, here's the song.  How I had the time of my life.  Now, I never felt this way before.  Yes, I swear.  It's the truth. 
[03:06:30]  And I owe it all to you.  Cause I've had the time of my life.  And I've always loved it with you.  I've been waiting for so long.  Now, I finally found this one to stay by me.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall. 
[03:07:00]  And you felt the magic called fantasy.  Now, we imagine it in our lives.  It's a way we couldn't decide secretly.  Now, we take each other's hands.  Cause we think we understand.  So, don't see.  Just remember us.  Yeah, that's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I'll tell you something.  There could be love.  Because.  I've had the time of my life.  But I never felt this way before.  Yes, I swear.  It's the truth.  That I owe it all to you. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, it's the truth.  Oh, it's the truth.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the truth.  In my body and soul, God, you know that you'd ever know.  Don't let it go, be afraid to lose control, no.  God knows all your mind, you stay, stay with me tonight. 
[03:08:30]  I can't get enough of, to tell you something, this can't be long, because I've had the time of my life,  no, I've never loved it anymore, but I can't make the truth, 
[03:09:00]  but I've had the time of my life, and I can't get enough of your life,  and I can't make the truth, but I've had the time of my life,  Thank you. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, and I swear this is the truth, and I owe it all to you. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, I had the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, and I swear this is the truth, 
[03:10:30]  and I know it all to you, and I have the time of my life, and I never felt this way before, and I swear this is the truth, and I know it all to you.

[03:12:00]  Bastard.  What's the name of that one band, the Hasidic Jew hip-hop guy, Modest Yahoo or something like that? 
[03:12:30]  What the hell is his name?  Does Ben know?  The Counting Pennies?  No, this guy is taking over the music world.  Maybe someone on Pal Talk or something can help me out.  Oh, I know.  Saturday, Sabbath.  Ben writes Maho Shoe.  It's not Maho Shoe.  It's something like...  Ah, Maho Shoe.  They all wear makeup. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, Kinnish.  Ah, love them.  Ah, help me out.  Modest...  Yeah, Modest Yahoo.  You hear any Modest Yahoo yet, Anthony?  Um, no.  Are you up with the kids' music or not?  We have any Modest Yahoo in the old...  The kids' music?  ...master computer?  This guy is just on fire.  We got anything there, Dirk?  XM's not on to the Modest Yahoo train yet?  Wow.  They're not playing it on...  They're not playing Modest Yahoo, really?  On the Jewish channel? 
[03:13:30]  It's pretty...  It's actually pretty cool.  Do we have, like, Hasidim channel 250 or something?  Dude, I made an ass out of myself, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what'd you do?  It reminded me of something.  I needed a present for Christmas, so I called Mike from XM, and I was trying to hunt down  this, like, digital picture frame, right?  And he said there's a store near Madison Square Garden, a massive camera slash electronic store.  They have everything you can imagine.  They even have lights for, um...  What do you got, Ben? 
[03:14:00]  Matt, go.  What's the hot song off there now?  Matt, say it, Ben.  Do you know the song?  Yeah, I'll find it.  So, um, they have everything.  If you're making a movie and you need some lights, you could go to this place.  They have absolutely everything.  They got, uh, cameras that are worth, like, $100,000, you know, um, you know, real cameras  you could use to shoot movies and stuff.  B&H?  No...  What is it called?  Yes.  B&H Photo.  That's it.  34th Street.  B&H?  Yeah.  Have you gone to B&H?  Many times.  So you know what I'm getting at?  I order online from them.  So you know what I'm getting at?  Oh, they're all Jewish, yeah.  Holy shit. 
[03:14:30]  So, uh, I'm talking to this guy, um, Laser.  Laser's a cool guy.  And, uh, he's like this, like, hip New York sounding dude.  Like, yo, when you're coming down here, a lot of people want to meet you.  A lot of fans down here.  And it, like, sounded like just a typical, like, Brooklyn, New Yorker.  Like, he cracks some shit.  So what you mean to say is a normal person.  Well...  Sounded like a normal person.  Sounded like, uh, sure.  A normal person.  All right.  So, uh, he goes, come on down, blah, blah, blah.  And I go down, and then, what is it called? 
[03:15:00]  B&H?  B&H Photo, yeah.  B&H Photo.  And, uh, what an operation.  I walk in, and it's, it's being run by Hasidic Jews.  Yeah.  And then Laser comes up, and he's, he can't be more than 5'5".  He's got the curly fry, uh, things happening on the side of his head.  What are they?  Payus?  Payus, they're called, right?  Payus.  And there's all young kids with the payus.  There's older guys with the payus.  There's payus everywhere.  Were they wearing yarmulkes, or the big, uh...  Yarmulkes.  Little House on the Prairie hats.  No, yarmulkes. 
[03:15:30]  Yarmulkes?  And, uh...  All black?  Trist in black?  Being a stupid suburban kid, I've never seen this in my life before.  I know you lived in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  You see one every once in a while, and it, and it kind of jolts you, uh, and go, whoa,  what was that type of thing?  Hey, what's that?  But the whole store.  So I'm walking around with Laser, he's giving me the, the tour of the place, and they're  doing ridiculous business, and they're closing at one or two or something like that.  And I'm, I was wondering why, and I, I realize it's, it's, uh, this place is owned by  a Hasidic Jew, and I'm, I'm, I'm guessing they have to close up before the sun goes down. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Because it was like, uh, it was like the day before, uh, Christmas Eve, uh, you know,  obviously you want to keep your store open as late as possible, and they were closing  before the sun went down.  Yep.  So I made a complete ass out of myself, I'm walking around, and I finally, I, I, I pull  Laser aside, I'm like, Laser, I gotta ask, because, you know, I'm a suburban dude.  What's up with all the, uh, you know, what's up with all you guys?  You actually asked that?  And he goes, no, no, he goes, no, we also have blacks and, uh, Mexicans and other 
[03:16:30]  people working here.  No Germans, I bet, right?  Yeah, but it's obvious you have a lot more of one kind here.  Yeah.  And I'm like, no disrespect, but I really gotta understand what the hell's going on here,  because it was like, I encourage everyone to go down there, it's like a tourist attraction.  Is it like the Amish?  It's theft proof, by the way.  Huh?  The theft proof.  You cannot shoplift there.  Really?  You saw the setup.  Have you tried?  No, but I, I'll show the setup, it's impossible. 
[03:17:00]  You, everything on, uh, the floor is a display model that really doesn't work.  Really?  Somehow that doesn't really work.  You, you wouldn't want to steal even the floor model.  So then you have to go to, uh, a computer with one of the Hasidic Jews, and then they  punch in the code, and then they have this conveyor belt system, and the, the actual merchandise  comes up from the warehouse on these, uh, what are they called?  It, it, it looks like, it's like, it's like, it's like the thing Lucy was eating the chocolates  off of.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like one of those conveyor belts.  But, but, but they're in the ceiling.  They're in the ceiling. 
[03:17:30]  They rock around the whole store, like, and then your product arrives at the cashier.  Wow.  You cannot steal from there.  Absolutely not.  It was the most amazing operation I've ever seen.  I'm not kidding.  I was just blown away.  I wanted to hang out there and just watch them for, like, hours.  And they're all courteous and professional, and every one of them knows what they're talking  about.  Every one of them can help you.  Here's the strange.  I've done business with them, uh, online, too, and their online operations are great.  Oh, they're terrific.  Like, they're unbelievable.  The thing that I wanted to point out, and so, uh, you know, it went around that, uh, 
[03:18:00]  Opie from Opie and Anthony was here, right?  They came out of the woodwork to say hi, and they're all huge fans.  I'm like, what?  Who the hell are we broadcasting to?  Everybody.  I would have never imagined that.  It's a melting pot.  We actually had Hasidic Jews that were not only listening to the show, but were enjoying  it.  I had no idea.  Very diverse audience.  We had no idea.  And not just a few.  Like, they were coming out from everywhere.  Yeah.  Everywhere.  To say hi and pictures.  You know the deal.  Sure.  But it was the strangest, strangest thing. 
[03:18:30]  That's the best place for electronic equipment, man.  B&H.  They never sell you shit.  It's always good.  And the guy goes to the computer, and he tells you what he has, and he knows it.  He's not some fucking 19-year-old idiot like you at any other store.  I can't imagine the business they were doing.  And then I'm leaving.  Like I said, let's say it was about three.  The sun was still up.  But they were closing up.  They were literally throwing, you know, the chains and everything on the doors, and they  got big, huge security guards.  They don't mess around at all there, right?  Were the security guards Hasidic?  Oh, no. 
[03:19:00]  They're not stupid.  No, they're not stupid.  Could you put that down, please?  They're not stupid.  Stealing is bad.  If your mother finds out, she will be angry.  They're not stupid.  But there was a whole, like, mob of people trying to get into the stores.  It was closing.  It was quite a sudden.  People are wondering, does B&H stand for beards and hats?  Actually, Laser was joking to me.  Like, yeah, some people, beards and hats.  Get it?  And I'm laughing uncomfortably. 
[03:19:30]  Like, am I supposed to laugh here?  I don't know.  I don't know what you're supposed to do, you wacky bastards.  Do you know I had to go into that store one time when they were closing?  I was going out of town somewhere.  Kenny was with me.  And I needed a thing for my camera.  Like a little, a portable charger.  So B&H, I knew it would have it.  I go up there and the door is closed.  And the awful security guard won't let me in.  Oh, no.  So I actually.  Poor Jimmy.  I get finally a Jewish guy as opposed to that awful security guard of unnameable ethnicity. 
[03:20:00]  I mentioned Manny from the Comedy Cellar because Manny, they would fucking, they loved him.  Oh, they loved Manny?  Loved him.  Because he was always in there and he spent a lot of money and he would bring them all to the Comedy Cellar.  Yeah.  And I mentioned his name at the door.  This is, like, two years after he died.  And I mentioned his name at the door.  And they're like, all right, hold on.  And they went and got somebody.  And it still got me in the door.  So just want to say hi to the gang at B&H.  Laser, no disrespect.  But I just had to know why.  It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.  You know?  And I learned something. 
[03:20:30]  These Hasidic Jews, especially the younger kids, they're kind of hip.  What, do you think they were all just going to be reading from the Torah the whole time?  They were kind of hip and with it.  And, you know, I'm just a stupid suburban kid.  I don't know.  Jews are people too, Opie.  You would think that type of religion, they would be beat down by the religion.  A little, uh, fanatic.  Here's a little taste of Madis Yahu.  This guy is blowing up. 
[03:21:00]  Do you understand?  I think he's even playing Madison Square Garden, like, the 14th with ore.  This is called King Without a Crown.  It kicks in right here.  A little reggae action.  See my, my, my, my, my, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.  See my, my, my, lo, yo.  See what you're for number, don't you. 
[03:21:30]  Dream of a dream, boy, yeah, boy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo.  Yeah.  See, you're all that I have and you're all that I need.  Each and every day I play to get to know you.  Please wanna be close to you.  Yes, I'm so hungry.  You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty.  With that new there's no me or the other.  I believe that sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see.  With the demons burn all around, they bring me down.  Soon they can see about me, but I believe.  Yes, I believe, I see the I believe.  And I send them home to feed, but we brought down on one knee. 
[03:22:00]  I fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee.  Hashem's rays, fire blaze, burn bright, and I believe.  Hashem's rays, fire blaze, burn bright, and I believe.  Out of darkness comes light, twilight, up to the heights.  Crown lights, you burn it up, all through the twilight.  Sorta thank you to my God, and I finally got it right.  Now I fight with all of my heart and all of my soul and all of my might.  And what's this feeling?  My love will rip a hole in the ceiling.  Giving myself to you now from the essence of my being.  And I sing to my God, songs of love and healing.  I want machine up now.  Time is such a beat.  We should have Big A learn this song. 
[03:22:30]  Give myself to you now from the essence of my being.  And I sing to my God.  You think his brain would just blow up?  It would just...  It's good.  What do you think, Ann?  Seriously.  Ah, he's doing it pretty well.  I really did not want to like this, but it's good.  This is all the rage, I'm telling you.  This is blowing up.  Right in front of our face.  Your cup's already full, then it's bound to overflow. 
[03:23:00]  You're drowning in the water, then you can't stay up low.  You make it?  You make it?  I have no idea the deal with him.  He's in a Hasidic Jew.  And he's rapping.  Searching up to the sky, looking beneath the ground.  That's all I know so far.  That's all you know so far?  This is off a CD called Live at Stubbs.  He's playing The Garden, dude.  This isn't like some cute little novelty act. 
[03:23:30]  Do you understand the standing ovation that this would get at the Apollo?  Oh, yeah.  They love whatever a white guy comes in and does.  Oh, yeah.  Anything that's black, they love.  Like if you're...  A white guy or an Asian guy comes up and can really do it well?  Yeah.  It's over.  They win.  Be unfollowable in your poder. 
[03:24:00]  Thank you. 
[03:24:30]  I see thunder, I feel it in ya, I feel it in ya thunder  I feel it in ya, I feel it in ya thunder  I feel it in ya, I feel it in ya thunder  I feel it in ya, I feel it in ya yo  Oh! 
[03:25:00]  Woo!  What's this feeling my love will be born in the ceiling  I give myself to you from the essence of my being  Listen to my God  There you have it. 
[03:25:30]  What's his name?  Well.  Modest Yahoo.  Blowing up.  Good.  I'm surprised that XM's not playing this.  Oh, my God.  It's not in the computer, or you finally found it?  I found it?  All right.  All right, good.  They're on top of it.  So, a little taste of Modest Yahoo in the show today.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Yeah, I learned that all Jimmy's dad wanted for Christmas was a Harry Potter movie and some 
[03:26:00]  lubricant.  Ah, very good.  Punch it out.  Let's say hi to Kara from MySpace.  Kara.  Hello.  Hey, Kara.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I called in to do Guess What's in My Pants, so it doesn't sound like I have any time.  No.  Can you call us tomorrow early?  I can.  All right.  Maybe we'll start the show off with you tomorrow, all right?  Sounds good.  What's in my pants with Kara tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony Show?  Thanks, Kara.  Let's go to Prozac from WackBag.com.  Prozac.  Hey, gentlemen.  I learned Opie visited Brokeback Buffet and that, and believe me, ideology of World War 
[03:26:30]  II Germans.  Hallelujah.  This is Josh from Wisconsin.  Josh.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I learned today, I learned today that the retards have teeth like a garage door.  That was a great line.  Yeah.  Take it easy.  All right.  And the listeners were very good today.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Yo, guys.  I've seen Modest Yahoo.  Yeah.  He played in Tennessee at Bonnaroo, and everyone goes crazy for him.  The dude just, he's insane. 
[03:27:00]  He has a good beater.  I mean, there's something going on that just is very catchy there.  Everyone played with him, too.  Like, he was everyone's guest, like, throughout the whole festival.  Where did he come from?  He just came out of nowhere.  I'm going to guess Brooklyn.  All right.  Later.  Thank you.  Let's go to Nick in South Carolina.  Nick.  Hey, I learned that Modenaccio, he's not as good as Gangsta Pack, but at least he won't  wipe his dick on your toys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Kids toys.  Well, that was a lot of fun.  Big hi to all the brand new XM listeners.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. 
[03:27:30]  All right.  This concludes our podcast day.  The Olympian Anthony Show. </pre>
