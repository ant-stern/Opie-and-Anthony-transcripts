<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts—Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton—recounting their experience at a Don Imus St. Patrick's Day charity event.  They described the surprisingly well-behaved, seated audience at the Hard Rock Cafe, contrasting it with their usual rowdier crowds.  The hosts noted the absence of any recording of the event by Imus, despite the presence of Sean Hannity and Rob Bartlett.  They shared jokes and observations from the event, including audience reactions to their "Sex for Sam" stunt. Anthony discussed his struggles with sobriety due to scheduling conflicts with Hannity’s show. Big A's significant weight loss and support system were also mentioned.  The hosts debated the merits of voting, criticized the tax system, and proposed a system allowing taxpayers to direct a small percentage of their taxes. They contrasted Imus's charitable work with criticisms levied against him, comparing this to the treatment of Al Sharpton.  Offensive language, including racial slurs and misogynistic comments, was used throughout this segment. The hosts also complained about the quality of their behind-the-scenes audio recordings and discussed their reputation for lateness and their social media interactions.  Further anecdotes from the Imus event, including Anthony’s impressions of Imus and Regan, and their opinions of Hannity’s personality, were shared.


The show continued with Opie recounting being ignored by Penn Jillette on the street. They also discussed E-Rock's lack of recognition by Sean Hannity despite E-Rock’s claims of a close relationship. The Fukushima nuclear disaster and the political situation in Libya were satirized and discussed, respectively.  The hosts speculated on the motivations behind celebrity guest appearances, suggesting that A-list stars often appear to promote less successful films.  They reviewed Matthew McConaughey's "The Lincoln Lawyer," contrasting aggregate reviews with a negative Daily News review.  The upcoming supermoon and its potential effects were also debated. A story about a babysitter paid in marijuana sparked a discussion on people's tendency to report indiscretions.  The segment ended with reminiscences about past romantic relationships, including a story about Opie's interaction with an ex-girlfriend's family, and a discussion of the impact of social media.  Joe Rogan and Ari Shaffir were announced as upcoming guests.


Joe Rogan and Ari Shaffir, along with Chuck Liddell, joined the show for a segment heavily focused on the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  The discussion expanded to include the dangers of nuclear meltdowns, inadequate safety measures, and the power and influence of large corporations like Monsanto, including speculation on their control over food production and the potential misuse of genetically modified foods. They also engaged in a tangential discussion of ancient religious texts and artwork, suggesting psychedelic drug use as the origin of many religious stories, sharing images and information about ancient artwork depicting mushrooms.  A caller identifying as a Monsanto employee defended the company, leading to a heated exchange.  The conversation further explored the vastness of the universe, the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and personal anecdotes from Rogan and others about their upbringing. The segment included crude humor, profanity, and sexually explicit jokes.


The show then transitioned to a discussion about sexual experiences in the context of strict Catholic upbringings, featuring graphic descriptions of high school sexual encounters and the hypocrisy surrounding the outwardly pious behavior of families whose daughters were sexually active.  Anecdotes about circumventing parental restrictions to attend movies were also included.  The discussion shifted to MMA, with guests Joe Rogan and Chuck Liddell. They discussed the UFC/Strikeforce merger, upcoming fights, notable fighters (including Alistair Overeem, Fedor Emelianenko, Gilbert Melendez, Nick Diaz, Kane Velasquez, Jon Jones, Shogun Rua, Uriah Faber, Eddie Wineland, Jim Miller, and Dan Miller), differences in fighting styles, fighters' physical conditioning, and the legalization of MMA in New York.  A video of Ari's posterior was mentioned, and an anecdote about Chuck Liddell's intimidating presence was shared.  Penn Jillette joined the discussion, focusing heavily on 9/11 conspiracy theories and his experiences with 9/11 truthers.  The Book of Mormon musical and the controversy surrounding depictions of Muhammad in media were also discussed, along with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and the dangers she faced due to her outspoken atheism.


A story about a woman who received an award for free thought despite facing death threats for leaving Islam and becoming an atheist opened the next segment. The hosts discussed the security concerns surrounding having her on the show. This led to a discussion on freedom of speech, comparing reactions to controversial depictions of Christianity versus Islam.  The Book of Mormon musical was praised for its humor and blasphemous nature, contrasted with the lack of backlash compared to other religious criticisms.  The discussion touched upon the history of religion, including the Inquisition, Galileo, and the evolution of religious tolerance in America.  Nicole, a studio guest, announced her engagement.  A prolonged segment featured a video of Ari displaying and discussing a hemorrhoid.  The conversation returned to religion, comparing Mormonism and Scientology, analyzing Scientology's growth, real estate holdings, and past aggressive legal tactics.  The discussion veered into the existence of advanced ancient civilizations, prompted by discussion of the Sphinx and geological evidence suggesting a much older construction date.  The hosts pondered the durability of various materials and the possibility of lost civilizations.  The segment concluded with tangents about the Everglades, DDT bans, zombie fungus affecting ants, a man running from pole to pole, Gilbert Gottfried's controversial tweets about Japan, and a personal anecdote from Joe Rogan about inappropriate touching by a TSA agent.


The final segment featured Penn Jillette discussing his experiences with airport security, politely refusing special treatment and criticizing the invasive searches. He described the security process as "security theater."  The conversation shifted to anecdotes about plane crashes and hijackings, including a detailed, graphic account of a FedEx plane incident involving a hammer and knife attack.  The hosts promoted Penn's show, "Play Dead," at the Players Theater in Las Vegas. The segment ended with a rapid-fire, expletive-laden patriotic rant about various aspects of American culture, concluding with shout-outs to the show and Sirius XM.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, it's Friday.  Friday, Friday, Friday.  Thank God.  You know what's weird?  You turn on the mic, you don't know what to say.  Because it's like, hi, everybody.  Hey, you want to make sure your voice is ready to go. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  So you just kind of test your voice out.  Hey, everybody, hi.  Yeah, take notice.  The first words out of our mouth are just mundane nonsense.  And is it really a greeting?  It's Friday, and who gives a fuck if we're telling them it's Friday.  And everyone knows we're here.  We really don't have to say hello.  No.  Hello.  I just want to make sure I didn't lose more of my voice overnight.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  You just kind of shake it out.  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey, everybody.  Got a few tones out there for everybody.  Hi there.  We had a long night last night, huh?  Oh, hey. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, it was kind of a long night.  It was fun, though.  It was fun.  I don't know what it was.  Well, we got a call a couple weeks ago that Imus wanted us for some kind of St. Paddy's  Day broadcast.  And we agreed.  Yeah.  And we assumed he was going to either record it for his radio show on WABC.  Right.  Or for his TV show.  TV show?  He does the simulcast.  You know, something we should be doing, and we've been waiting years to do. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, well.  But maybe they'll figure that out someday.  Yeah.  And it was going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  It was at the Hard Rock Cafe.  And we went.  It was for a charity.  And it was a lot of fun.  But I don't really understand what the purpose was.  What it was.  It was fun.  Because he didn't record it for radio or TV.  And honestly, I was watching before we went on stage, and it was a really good show.  Yeah.  Rob Bartlett was killing with some material.  They had the Jersey Boys singing. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, from Broadway.  And then Imus interviewed me, you, and Sean Hannity.  Yeah.  And there were a lot of laughs in there.  It was fun.  But now it's just gone.  Now it's gone.  Like, why would you do that?  Right into the ether, it went.  And I was trying to, you know, talk to Imus about that, and Sean Hannity.  I'm like, why are we doing this if no one's recording it?  It just sounds stupid.  Seems stupid.  I'm still like, bye.  You tape it, you get in trouble.  People pick it apart and get in trouble.  Yeah.  See, he's old school.  Because I said, look, people are taping this no matter what in the audience. 
[00:03:30]  They got their cell phones up and HD flips or whatever they're using.  So.  I'm not dropping N-bombs every other word.  I mean, you know.  I understand his paranoia, but.  Yeah.  But it was a lot of fun, and it was for a good cause.  It was for his ranch, I guess.  Yeah.  That he was kind of downplaying.  My first observation, you walk into the Hard Rock Cafe, and everyone was seated.  That's really strange for us.  We, uh, we've done quite a few things there at that venue, and never were there seats and  people just sitting nicely. 
[00:04:00]  Real nicely.  Yeah.  You know, Imus or one of his guys went on stage, and they actually sat and listened.  And listened.  There weren't any show your tits chants, or fuck you, fuck you.  It was amazing.  I didn't know people did events like that.  And I'm not beating up our listeners.  I'm just saying it was a little different and a little strange to see a different presentation.  Yes, we were quite taken aback.  Right.  You know, as far as our events go, we walk on a stage, and they're pretty much yelling, 
[00:04:30]  fuck you, Tossin.  Fuck you.  And you think, wait, am I at the wrong venue?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Could you imagine Imus getting up there and going, oh, I want to thank everybody for coming  here, and someone winging a water bottle at his head?  Right.  Like, that doesn't happen.  It happens when we go out.  I didn't even know the Hard Rock Cafe had seats for people to sit down.  Yeah, yeah.  People to actually sit down and watch something nicely.  Right.  And they actually listen, and they don't shout out things. 
[00:05:00]  Fascinating.  It was very fascinating.  But not recording.  It was kind of, I don't understand that one.  Did it ever really happen?  I don't know.  Once there's no history of it, it's it.  How cool was Imus?  He's fucking the best, man.  He doesn't give a shit about anything.  That's the best part of it.  We could all learn from him.  He's just been through so much in his career and his life that he doesn't have to give a 
[00:05:30]  shit about anything.  He gives a shit about, you know, things he's passionate about, the ranch and, you know, his friends doing the show, things like that.  But, like, faced with something where it's like, oh boy, usually you go out of your way to do something or say something nice, even if you don't mean it.  Right.  He's way past having to do that in his life.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he's just like, asshole, fuck that guy.  Oh, man.  Shit head, fuck you.  Oh, man, he had a lot of fuck yous.  It was great.  He had a lot of fuck yous, and I'm debating if I should give you the Don Imus fuck you list that he gave me. 
[00:06:00]  I wouldn't blow up his spot.  I'm debating.  I wouldn't blow up his spot.  No, the reason I'm debating, because I don't think he cares.  I think in a weird way he wants me to give the Don Imus fuck you list.  Maybe you better check with him first.  I'm debating.  I could write him right now and ask him.  But it was good to see Sean Hannity.  Yeah.  Your buddy.  Sean's great.  He's your pal.  He's my pal.  He's your pal politically. 
[00:06:30]  I like the guy personally.  I don't really like him politically, to be completely honest with you.  But, you know, whatever.  It's fine.  Politics or politics.  I'm not a big politics guy.  Actually, Imus asked me some politics on stage, and I go, I've never, and I can't believe I said this,  because I knew the audience.  I go, I have never voted for a president officially.  Yeah, there was a little, oh.  Oh, the boos.  I got boos.  And I go, I know, I'm that guy.  But, you know, there was a lot of honesty on that stage.  They were not happy that I never voted before. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Not happy.  No, they were like, I don't understand that concept, that you should at least vote.  I mean, maybe someday I'll vote if I get real passion behind somebody.  I don't think, that's just it, though.  I don't think you're ever, and I don't think people that vote, unless they're fanatics,  are really like, wow, I've got to get out and vote for this guy, because he believes in everything I do.  But he's always going to be like, ah, well, yeah, fair.  I think I should vote for the local guys, because the local shit is where I'm at. 
[00:07:30]  The local shit drives me nuts.  A lot of times it does more voting for those guys.  Overall, the presidency doesn't drive me as nuts as the local politicians and the shit they're pulling.  It drives me crazy.  This is one of the first years, election years, that I looked into all the local guys and was like, okay, what does this guy represent?  What does he stand for?  A lot of, you know, I was looking for a lot of Second Amendment guys. 
[00:08:00]  Right, right.  You know, locally, things like that.  And just tax breaks.  You know, guys that weren't going to raise my fucking local taxes.  Right.  Property taxes, things like that.  And, you know, you vote for those guys.  I think it's time to dip in.  Dip in?  Get your feet in the water a little bit?  I'm serious.  Yeah.  I'm not even joking.  I think it's time to dip in.  At least start looking at the local guys.  Because, you know, I bitch about all the crap that is happening here in New York City.  Yeah.  Which is kind of my home now, I guess.  As much as I don't want to acknowledge that I'm a New Yorker, I like to think I'm still a Long Islander. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you've kind of been here a while.  Yeah, it's been about six years, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're a New Yorker.  But the event was a lot of fun.  Yeah, it was.  It was very cool to be there.  Boy, we saw, go figure, Big A was there.  Yeah.  Good to see Big A there.  Almost Big A.  Almost Big A.  He's lost 80 pounds.  Is it 80 he's up to?  Big A, 614 on Twitter if you want to congratulate him.  Of course, half you guys will have to fucking beat him up for losing 80 pounds.  Yeah, yeah.  You do what you got to do.  You got to shit on him.  Yeah, do what you got to do. 
[00:09:00]  But I'm actually stepping out of character and congratulating him.  Shit on Big A.  Hey, only we can shit on Big A.  Because he was in a tough spot and he listened to the advice that he was getting around him  and he's doing the right thing.  He's lost 80 pounds.  I think Dr. Steve scared the shit out of him.  I think a few people scared the shit out of him.  I don't know how much he wants us to say.  Dr. Steve pretty much talked to him and said, like, you're fucking, you're just a dead man.  All right.  You want to go with it?  I mean, come on.  Who doesn't know that?  He had a situation and people actually said, look, no shit. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You are in deep trouble unless you lose a lot of weight and get healthy immediately.  And it's good to see that he's got the willpower to do that.  So keep it up, Big A.  Yes.  And I guess we're all paying for his medical bills.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I've donated.  Am I donating again?  Yeah, you know, people donate to this cause, that cause.  But that's the way I like it.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, I don't like being told I have to donate to something, especially, again, the 
[00:10:00]  tax thing and everything.  But I like, you know, people I know that might be in need of something, a couple of bucks.  And you give them in that way.  Right.  That way, at least, there's people I fucking know.  Yeah, I like helping the people I know.  Like, giving to some schlep I don't fucking know that might be abusing the system and  lining their own pockets with my cash.  I think I got one of the greatest ideas ever.  I mean, we all pay way too many taxes. 
[00:10:30]  Go home now?  What?  Hell, well, that would be awesome.  That's a great idea.  Yeah, everyone thought we weren't going to be here because we did the IMAX event.  God, I guess we have a reputation of being lazy or something.  I know.  Every time they see us tweeting too late or, oh, you're at the IMAX event, I guess that  means you won't be doing a show tomorrow.  No show tomorrow.  I think we have a really bad reputation at this point.  One more fucking tweet that I get.  Hey, what are you still doing up?  Get to sleep.  You got a show to do.  I get that all the time on, like, Facebook. 
[00:11:00]  I just, I don't even respond anymore.  I know.  You just get removed.  I know.  I know.  I'm just tired.  You just get removed.  Exactly.  It's like, do you understand?  I slept from 1045 until 8 p.m. sometimes.  I wake up at 8 at night, and I'm like, ah, I'm ready for my day.  My day will last until 3 a.m., and what, I might take a nap before the show, and people  are like, what are you doing up?  It's like, you didn't know what I did.  I fucking slept like I was in hibernation.  I think this Twitter is really weird that we just openly give everyone our cell phone 
[00:11:30]  number because that's what it is.  That's really, really strange.  They can't call you and talk to you, but they can text.  It's them texting you.  Yeah.  They're sending you a text message that everyone else can see, too.  Why would you do that to yourselves?  Why?  Why would I do that?  I don't even know why I'm doing it.  You know why?  Because we're also all pompous enough to think everyone wants to see what we have to say.  True.  True.  So it kind of opens you up to the other half of that, which was now people commenting on.  Really strange. 
[00:12:00]  Whatever.  It is odd.  It's this whole community now where everyone has access to everyone.  Where were we?  We were at the Imus appearance, and then we did that.  The interview segment was very interesting and kind of fun.  We were all up on the stage in a little semicircle around this nice little table with Don Imus there, and Sean Hannity, and then me, and then Opie.  And Imus was interviewing. 
[00:12:30]  I didn't know this was going to be the format, by the way.  You didn't?  I thought it was going to be kind of us with headphones on, microphone, Imus.  Doing a little radio.  And Bartlett, Hannity doing some radio.  Yeah, we did one of these a couple years back.  It was like that.  Yeah.  We were the only ones brave enough to go on Imus' show after he got fucked, if you remember.  Yeah, well, that's kind of, you know, it's us.  Yeah, I guess.  For the love of God.  Yeah.  You know, what are we trying to fucking protect?  You know, I know I'm never going to hammer this point home to a lot of people out there, but Imus is a very nice, charitable guy, but everyone just wants to yell racist wherever he goes. 
[00:13:00]  I know.  It's terrible.  The guy has raised a shitload of money.  He's raised more money than any other radio guy, easily.  Easily.  There's hospitals named after him.  Wings of hospitals that he raised.  There are so many people out there that will never look at actual things that are done.  They will look at symbolic things that are said or implied or joked about and completely wipe out a person's life of work, what they've done to better their neighborhood or the world or health of children is what Imus is doing. 
[00:13:30]  And then it's like, oh, he said that?  Well, fuck him and he should be removed from everything.  It's like, really, what's more important?  A slip of the tongue during a fucking live radio broadcast where you're just going off the cuff or a lifetime of work for charitable contributions to children? 
[00:14:00]  You fucking people make me sick sometimes.  I would love to know how much money Al Sharpton has raised in his career for charitable calls.  Without it going into his fucking pocket.  Look, I'm not a huge charitable guy, but I try and I do contribute when I can.  We all give to what we feel is important to us and people that are close to us. 
[00:14:30]  But Imus has looked at as a bad guy in Sharpton.  Sharpton's just an asshole.  We all know that.  But there are people that take him so seriously.  I would love to know how much money he's given to charity.  I bet you it's minuscule at best.  Yeah, thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  My idea.  So we all pay too many taxes.  And you've got the big A where we're helping out a little bit here.  And I still have to give to the Cancer Kids charity through my old high school, Harborfields High School.  I haven't forgotten.  You're doing that? 
[00:15:00]  Well, I don't want to use my credit card online.  Really?  Well, I use it some places, but then other places I'm like, man, I don't know, man.  So I almost want this person to just stop by FH Riley's and I'll leave some cash for them.  Make it easy that way.  Just look up Brett and say, Brett, your brother left me some money.  Oh, really?  This sounds like a shady deal now.  You have a drop location for money at a bar?  What are you doing?  Brett will give you $1,000. 
[00:15:30]  And it's only for the one guy.  And I'll give Brett the name.  Is that what it has to be?  Yes.  Well, because now everyone local around my brother's restaurant, now they're going to come in going, Brett, your brother left me $1,000.  Left me a grant.  I'm here to pick it up.  No, there's a code.  There's a code name for this one.  There's a code.  This does sound shady.  My idea, because we all pay way too many taxes.  Just imagine if the government, you're going to have to give them money anyway.  Yeah.  But what if a small percent of your taxes, you were able to go, this is what I want to do with it. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  How great would that be?  That is.  Because I don't trust the government and what they're doing with my taxes.  Now, I understand they can't make it where you decide where all your tax money is going.  Just at least give you a little small percentage so you feel like you have some control of where your money's going.  Just a little bit.  Even if that means helping out your own family, maybe your own little neighborhood, maybe a big A type. 
[00:16:30]  So they would tax you and not increase the tax and add that to your tax.  No, no, no, no.  So it's like, here's your tax.  But then you get a percentage and you're like.  Give me 5%.  Yeah, 5%.  Give me 5% of the money I have to give the government that I actually write and tell you what you have to do with it.  And I get a receipt that you actually did that.  How great would that be?  That's pretty good.  Why trust the government with our tax dollars?  With every cent.  Like, yeah, they got to pay for the roads and shit and the army and everything like that. 
[00:17:00]  But you get a little bit, but you can give it to whatever the fuck you want.  I think I would feel way better about paying taxes.  At least I would know.  Okay, I at least know this amount of money went to something I give a shit about.  And maybe there's even a list the government comes up with.  So you can't, I don't know.  Give to like Al-Qaeda or something.  It's like, give my tax dollars going to Al-Qaeda.  I like that idea.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  You know?  Because I would like to help my family more, but with the taxes we pay, it makes it hard. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  It really makes it hard.  Yeah, you're constantly just trying to juggle your finances because they tax the shit out of you.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  So, yeah, so the Imus interview was good.  Yeah, we're doing that.  The audience was a bit old.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it was an Imus demo, you know.  Imus doesn't pull a demo like our show.  And I wish I had the audio because Imus is going through our careers again.  Yeah, I know.  We've told this story so many fucking times.  But I guess it's new for those people.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  And then we got to the Sex for Sam stunt.  Oh, boy.  And took that one on.  Wow.  In front of an old crowd.  And I look at them at one point and I go, you're trying to turn this crowd around?  There's no way.  Yeah, I know.  You were trying to sell this bit to this crowd.  Like, look, go with it with us here.  They were horrified when you were telling the story.  I know, I know.  My preface lasted quite a while because I was trying to soften the beaches.  Right.  Because I knew it was coming.  And so I was trying to soften the beaches by letting them know, look, this is going to be bad. 
[00:18:30]  I know what our story is here.  And it's not good.  You're not going to sit there and be like, oh, that's great.  And then I tried to tell it in a little humorous way where there were a couple of laughs and self-deprecation.  And we understand how awful it was.  So I think for as crazy as it is to tell that story to that audience, it was probably the best I could have done with that situation. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, we got a few laughs.  Yeah, yeah.  I looked at one point.  There was a real old guy, dead center, laughing his ass off.  Yeah, yeah.  He gets it.  He's laughing.  He's laughing.  He's laughing.  He got it.  He got it.  He's laughing.  But the rest of them, there were a few moans and groaning.  At one point during the Sex with Sam soliloquy, I saw an older woman literally put her hand to her mouth.  Oh, really?  And go, and gasped?  Yeah, she gasped.  She gasped with her hand over her mouth. 
[00:19:30]  A bit of a gasp.  And I was looking like, oh, fuck.  Right.  Maybe I went too far.  Nah, not really.  Maybe it was when I said the phone, and I went and was like, hey, they're fucking.  Yeah.  And I said fucking.  Oh, we weren't on radio.  Or TV.  And Sean Hannity just puts his head down.  Or TV.  Starts shaking his head like, oh, boy.  Yeah, Sean was a little uncomfortable with that.  Ah, he's cool.  He supported us through that whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But I think personally he was disgusted with us because I believe he's a bit religious.  Well, he's a Christian.  Christian conservative.  You know, he's a conservative. 
[00:20:00]  Those people are terrific.  You know.  Sean likes to have fun, though.  It's not like one of those stick-in-the-mud guys.  You can tell.  He likes to have a lot of fun.  He's a great family guy.  He likes shooting.  He likes playing tennis.  He spends time with his kids and stuff.  He's a regular guy.  He's a good guy.  I like the Hannity.  All right.  Well, we got some behind-the-scenes audio of the Kiss Me on My Miss event. 
[00:20:30]  Because we figured someone should record something.  I know.  For the love of God.  So I think good old Sam.  Of course it's Sam.  Well, he's working off the clock.  He didn't have to fucking be there.  He showed up and talked to us in the green room right after the interview we did with  Imus on the stage for the charity event.  Yeah.  So we got a couple of tracks here.  The first one, 0-8, talk about the interview.  Oh.  This was afterwards?  Right after. 
[00:21:00]  What happened?  I don't know what that was.  It was almost like in the actor's studio for radio.  Except not aired anywhere.  Except a television show.  It was a one-off.  It was a complete wasted time.  Because it wasn't on TV or radio.  Right.  Yeah.  If there's no TV or radio, why would you do anything?  The brilliance will never be captured.  I wasn't even recording it.  No.  Oh, really?  No.  I'm sure somebody was.  The audience was old as dirt.  And they hated us.  Yeah.  There were a couple people. 
[00:21:30]  And Anne's trying to, like, explain our St. Pat's, uh, uh, uh.  Yeah.  The words for Sam.  Did you look at the audience when that was going on?  Yeah, they were horrified.  And Anne's trying to sell, like, no, I think I can turn you guys around.  I literally saw a woman put her hand over her mouth and gasp.  She went like, oh!  You, you, like, excused yourself by saying it actually wasn't in the church.  It was in the vestibule of said church.  As if that was going to make them.  The further away from the giant crucifix, the better.  Right.  Um, the image of that.  You were losing Sean Hannity, your pal. 
[00:22:00]  He was even shaking his head going, oh my God.  Well, I was trying to, I was trying to word it.  Well, Don asked the question.  I had an answer.  Right.  And I was wording it in a way where I said sexual encounter and that.  And then I had to throw the F-bomb in because, uh, you know.  Shock Jack's in the house.  I'm a shock jock.  Look out.  Shocking.  Winning.  Winning.  Shocking.  Duh.  So that was audio from last night.  Yeah.  We just did that whole, whole break right before we played that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  That's kind of weird.  I don't know what we did. 
[00:22:30]  Another observation.  You know, we decided to do a little more behind the scenes stuff.  We need a better recorder.  How, how old is that?  What is that thing?  Yeah.  It looks like, uh, it looks old.  It's, it's, the sound of it is horrible.  Horrible.  It, uh.  I get better audio on my flip.  Yeah.  What is that thing?  It looks like an oldie style cell phone.  Could, uh.  Uh, who runs the channel these days?  Do we know?  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Just give me, you don't know?  All right.  Uh, whoever's running the channel, if they could get us a better recorder for the behind 
[00:23:00]  the scenes stuff, that would be very nice.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Consider this official.  We don't have to have a meeting about it.  Just go out and get a nice record for us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  Uh, then I talked to Hannity about doing his show.  That's the first thing he said as soon as I showed up.  Yeah.  He is obsessed.  I know.  And it, it kind of, it, it, it, it, enough already.  He wants you on that show.  But I don't know politics.  I don't know.  He just, I do what I can on this show when we talk politics, but I don't really have the 
[00:23:30]  passion to talk politics on Fox news.  He wants you on there.  I mean, before he even said, said, hi, he goes, when are you doing my show?  And then he wanted me to do the show with you last night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I was dressed like a fucking bum.  I thought there was like, it was a casual event and then you guys are all in suits.  Well, I knew you'd be in a suit cause you were actually doing Hannity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think he owns anything but suits and even I miss was kind of dressed.  And then I, I have almost like a Vietnam jacket. 
[00:24:00]  I like that thing by the way.  You know, that's a great old school, like fucking nom era looking jacket.  That's brand new too.  I'll tell you where I got it.  Oh, little retro jacket.  Retro.  That I just bought.  I like it.  But I actually had a, a nice dress shirt on stuff.  And as I was leaving the house, uh, my girl's going, nah, man, it's a casual event.  Oh no.  Undermined.  She undermined me a little bit.  And I'm thinking, yeah, you know, hard rock cafe.  We've had events there.  The beer is probably going to be flowing. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  I don't think there was any beer in the, uh, the entire event.  No, there wasn't.  Right.  Oh, believe me.  I know.  And you were creepily creep.  What's the word?  Creepy.  Yeah.  Creepily.  Creep.  All right.  We'll go with creepily sober last night.  I was really bothersome.  It was bothersome to me.  Was it?  It was.  You were chomping at the bit.  I was.  You were, you were torn, man.  I saw it in your eyes.  I was going crazy.  Yeah.  Cause you knew the I'm his event was a throwaway event. 
[00:25:00]  So you're like, I could have a few at this damn thing.  But then you had Hannity right afterwards.  But I had Hannity after and I knew I couldn't fucking go on Hannity, like fucking three sheets  to the wind.  Were you itching?  Uh, yeah, I was itching.  Were the shakes happening?  I was getting the shakes.  I was getting the cold sweats.  Um, I needed to get well.  I needed to get well.  How many does it take to get well?  One?  Uh, but yeah, one.  And I'm feeling, I'm feeling better.  So, uh, yeah, I, I realized it was probably about eight, eight 30 at eight o'clock. 
[00:25:30]  I had, I had to be over at Fox at nine for Hannity show.  So at eight o'clock, um, me and, and, uh, Melissa were walking over to Fox and we realized  we hadn't eaten anything and, uh, we stopped to get some dinner and that was the first  beer I had.  I had one Guinness with dinner and that was it.  And then we went and did Hannity and then I get done with Hannity.  Now it's, it's St. Patty's day.  It's after 10 o'clock and you've had, and I've had one fucking Guinness. 
[00:26:00]  But that's good.  Cause we said it was amateur day anyway.  I know, but I kind of want to jump in, you know, I kind of, so, and then I went back  to the hotel.  You kind of just dipped, dipped your toes in.  Dipped my toes in a little bit.  You wanted to fucking cannonball it, man.  Oh, I, I fucking, I would have, you've, you, I, we've been to events, we've done events  on, on St. Patty's day.  I didn't know how to talk to you sober.  I know.  It was very odd.  It was odd.  I had water in my hand, a water bottle.  What do I say to them? 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I can, I could talk to them when we're doing radio together.  That's easy.  But when we're out and about, I don't know how to talk to you if you're sober.  I hate remembering what I said.  Sam, what's up?  Are we getting a better recorder?  Sam?  Well, I traded in the old recorder for this one because the old recorder doesn't keep  a charge.  No, that thing sucks.  It's not that bad.  No, it's bad.  No, it's bad.  It's bad.  It's got double, I need some with double A batteries though because the old ones would  run out of a charge.  Where'd you get that?  Yeah, tell him to get us a better recorder. 
[00:27:00]  It looks like a shaver or a big cell phone.  Imus didn't know what it was.  That's why I didn't go to Imus for a comment because as soon as I went in there, he was  like...  He's intimidating.  And he goes, what is that?  One of those recorders?  Recorder?  Whoa.  Yeah, but it's not on and I just kind of put it in my pocket.  Why don't you get the fuck out of here, you fucking fucksucker?  He's very aware people around him could be recording him to try to ruin his career.  Yeah, he doesn't really like that.  Now tell the boys down the hall, you know the money they saved re-signing us? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Use some of that money and get us a much better recorder.  Buy one digital fucking recorder.  Exactly.  Yeah, the audio's not that good.  It's passable, but if we're going to be doing behind the scenes stuff, we need something  a little better.  But then they're going to give me a recorder and the charter's going to run out.  No, tell them to figure it all out.  You just need a brand new one that works and not some old fucking piece of shit.  Maybe you should present to them which one you'd like.  Yeah, how about that?  Do a little research. 
[00:28:00]  What do you want that one for?  Why do you attach to that one?  Do you hear what it sounded like?  You just got to pop the levels and everything.  No, the levels.  There were dropouts.  I think Mars is also working on an external microphone for this recorder.  Fuck that one.  Go to B&H.  Go to the website.  Go to bnh.com there, whatever it is.  And pick out something good.  Read the reviews on it.  And then submit it to them and go, we as a show need this.  And then they say no.  No, no, no, no.  And then we...  No.  Go.  We need this. 
[00:28:30]  And Opie and Anthony are saying, you know, you saved a shitload of money fucking them over  in the last contract.  So they want you to use some of that money to get me a better recorder.  There are some dropout issues, but I feel like if we just get a mic on this recorder...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's get a better recorder.  All right.  Make those guys work a few minutes for the...  I was going to say for the show.  Oh, yeah.  For the channel.  All right.  More behind-the-scenes audio right after the interview we did with Mr. Imus and Sean Hannity.  Mr. Imus.  Now, you're on your way to do Hannity now. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Opie, Hannity was trying to get you to do his show.  He actually said come over tonight, but I'm not dressed for it, Sam, so I'm going to go  home.  You could look fine without the jacket on.  Yeah, do you think...  Actually, that's good.  That's like Vietnam-era shit.  That's nice.  I would definitely fucking wear that.  Do you think Opie's ever going to end up on Hannity's TV show?  No.  Opie?  I think I'm actually going to not do it, yeah.  Unless he wants to talk about what? 
[00:29:30]  Like, we would have went on and talked about Charlie Sheen.  Different things to call beer.  Or Gilbert Gottfried.  Yeah, maybe talk about road sodas.  Yeah, the first one has come in, by the way, Jordan Scranton.  Only one road soda, Anthony, before Hannity?  I know.  I needed more road sodas.  And I'm fully aware I sound like a complete asshole bringing road soda to the radio show,  by the way.  I needed more road sodas.  It was St. Paddy's Day, and I think that's the first St. Paddy's Day in a lifetime. 
[00:30:00]  I haven't been hammered.  Dude, I swear to you, on the way down to Imus, I forgot this until just a second.  I almost saw a drunk just get fucking crushed by a car.  Oh, really?  This guy jammed on his brakes to the point I thought the airbags were going to pop.  Really?  Yeah.  One of those?  And then the drunk looks at the driver like, what's, you know, just has no clue.  It was fucking insane.  The guy missed him by, I swear to you, less than a foot. 
[00:30:30]  And it was a green light.  Yeah.  We were stopped at the light, and it just turned green, and the guy was still walking  across.  You know, he walked in front of our cab.  Yeah.  And then it's clear sailing on the right side, and this guy almost got fucking plowed  right in front of my eyes.  It was a cavalcade of drunks.  And like I said, I usually have a few during our broadcast, or right after our broadcast,  which would be the morning on St. Paddy's Day, because we've been out, and, you know, 
[00:31:00]  people are, fans are giving us beers and shit like that.  And without having that yesterday, I had to walk from here to John Sahag yesterday, and  I had to cross Fifth, which was a pain in the fucking ass with a parade going.  Did I tell you?  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  You have to run in between bands if the cops let you.  No, you have to wait.  There are certain roads where you're allowed to cross.  Right.  And you have to wait in a big line.  Right.  And then the cops go, all right, go, go, go, in between, like, marching bands. 
[00:31:30]  But you know what the problem is with that, especially if you're driving, they'll let  you go down a block, but you don't know that you can't cut through the parade until they  stop it.  Right.  So I made a boo-boo, and I assumed, because they were letting cars go down one road, I  figured, oh, okay, well, obviously they're going to let traffic flow across the parade  route.  So I took the turn.  Oh, no.  But what I didn't realize was that they were shutting it down again, and then only opening  it up to traffic maybe for a minute every 15. 
[00:32:00]  I know, yeah, because they've got to stop the parade, and then people are just marching  in place, and you get to go either walk or drive.  I've had to drive home through the parade, and it's a nightmare.  Literally through the parade.  Yeah, yeah, you go through the parade.  Like they move barricades, and then you drive, and then they put the barricades on.  Oh, I like to think that he actually fucking drove through the parade.  Yeah, there are some parades I really want to do that.  Not the St. Paddy's Day parades.  There are a few I'd like to, you know, goose the gas. 
[00:32:30]  But, yeah, I had to walk, so I got across the parade route, and the drunks.  Now, I could deal with drunks when I'm drinking, but being sober, it was just an annoying mass  of drunken people yelling.  Just the yelling.  And the vuvuzelas, the vuvuzela, people think that's kind of still cool to, the big green  ones.  And then I'm walking, right, and there's this fat chick, big, fat, nasty chick in some 
[00:33:00]  green wife beater thing with her blubber hanging out.  And her skinny friend is kind of guiding her through the crowd.  And I'm kind of working my way through the crowd.  And, you know, when you walk in, you swing your arm a little.  I swung my arm, and my elbows, like, kind of brushed the side of her big, fat tit.  Of the fat girl?  Yeah.  As I was going past her.  Right.  And she goes, she goes, excuse me. 
[00:33:30]  Like, in this crowd that is pressed together, there's no room for anyone, that people aren't  going to bump into each other.  And if you're saying excuse me to everyone you bump into, you'd just be saying excuse  me the whole time.  There are certain times, yeah, you say excuse me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Whatever.  Right.  But I'm just moving.  I don't care.  I'm moving.  And she goes, excuse me.  And I just, I kept walking.  And I didn't look at her.  I just kind of put one hand up, like, yeah, I got you. 
[00:34:00]  Like, acknowledging I heard that.  And she's like, well, fuck you.  Jesus.  What a mess.  And then I just put my hand up again.  I went, fat cunt.  And kept walking.  Like, that was my exchange.  Good for you, man.  That was my exchange.  Are you sure you weren't going for an E.T.?  No, I wasn't going for an E.T.  It would have been easy.  See, me and my boys, after a few road sodas, then we'd go to Huntington.  We'd go to, what is this, American Graffiti? 
[00:34:30]  When did you grow up?  The 50s?  And we would actually do E.T.'s in bars.  Hey, let's go elbow-titting.  And ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-dang-dang-bang-a-dang-dang-dang-dang.  Open all his buddies are going to go try to find a body in the woods.  He's got the Cobras carved into his bicep.  We were fucking nerds, man.  Elbow-titting.  I guess it's finally a myth.  I was pretty nerdy growing up.  A nerd?  We would go to the bars, and then we would take turns going through the crowd to get E.T.'s.  Yeah, hey, let me get this.  And see who was brave enough to get E.T.'s. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, yeah, look, you do look like the guy.  Oh, Jesus.  Give me a break.  What is that, Stand By Me?  Yeah, great.  Yeah, yeah, I just watched it today.  I think a Blu-ray is coming out next week or two.  Yeah, that's a good movie.  They just had the anniversary, didn't they?  Yeah, 25th anniversary.  Wasn't someone missing from the picture?  Oops.  Oops.  Who's missing?  Am I missing somebody?  River Phoenix?  Oh.  Oh, wait.  Oh.  He was in that, right?  Yeah.  I don't... 
[00:35:30]  Was he pudgy back then?  No, no, no, no.  That's not him.  Wait, not the pud...  Which one am I thinking?  I saw a picture recently.  Am I thinking, Stand By Me?  What did I see?  Where they said River Phoenix is missing.  What movie?  Damn it.  Corey Feldman was there.  I'm waiting.  Waiting for an answer to pop up.  No one's giving it to me.  Oh, boy.  Come on, people.  You're talking about all kinds of shit.  Am I thinking of something completely different?  Hang on.  I'll check his...  Let's just stop the show. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, he wasn't Stand By Me.  Yes.  God, I thought I was losing my mind.  All right.  I know I'm losing my mind, but okay.  Yeah, they had a picture because it's the 25th anniversary, I think.  Yeah.  And they got a bunch of the guys together.  And River Phoenix, obviously, was...  Not there.  ...missing from the photo.  Cut down in his prime.  And I saw that Corey Feldman was in the photo.  And I got to tell you, in an update, he's still hurting.  Is he hurting?  Corey Feldman is still hurting.  Still hurting from...  ...Michael Jackson.  And the other Corey dying.  Oh, right.  He had a double whammy in the last year. 
[00:36:30]  I never realized that was him.  Yeah, that's him.  Yeah, man.  I was like...  Yes, he was in Stand By Me.  I haven't seen the movie in years, but okay.  I get confused because that fat kid grew up to be somebody.  So I always get confused, like, which one is who?  Gary O'Connell.  The fat kid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Grew up to be the Sliders guy.  That's all I know him for.  Sliders.  So, you got through the crowd yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  I got through the crowd and...  ...called a fat pig, a fat cunt.  A fat cunt because she said, fuck you. 
[00:37:00]  And by the way, it was...  That was the whole crowd.  Everyone was just yelling.  And then, like, guys just yelling at girls for no fucking reason.  Yeah!  Woo!  A lot of woos!  And it wouldn't bother me if I had been drinking, but I wasn't, you know, so...  So you felt out of place, huh?  Yeah, I felt so out of place.  All right.  Then after the interview at the Kiss Me, I Miss Charity event, Ant believes Hannity used 
[00:37:30]  to drink and drive.  Well, just based on geography.  I don't know.  Alone.  I don't want to, like, do the clip before we play the clip, but the setup...  Ant and I were talking about the old days.  Long Island, you absolutely was drinking and driving.  And it was sort of accepted.  Growing up, that's what you did.  And Sam, who's a lot younger than us, was completely outraged.  And I'm like, we're not trying to be shocking.  This was something that a lot of the older guys, no matter where you live, could relate to. 
[00:38:00]  You got your car, you got your license, you got your car, you got your friends, and you drank,  and you drove around your local town.  I believe.  Look, scoping chicks.  Right.  Which you never got.  Right.  No, of course not.  And in a lot of cases, the cops would see you driving drunk, and they would take your  keys until the end of their shift, or they would tell you to go to a fucking diner if  you were close, and, you know, if I see that car pull out in the next few hours, you know,  I am going to arrest you. 
[00:38:30]  You wouldn't make deals with the cops in general.  They also were arresting people, yes, but not as much as they do now.  And I have to say, we're better off now, yes.  Right.  I'm not saying it's a good thing.  But we did live through this era where it was more accepted.  Yeah, it was.  They kind of just went with it.  It was.  And Sam was shocked, and I think we were talking about that, and then we brought up Hannity  again.  I have a feeling Sean Hannity didn't grow up getting road sodas.  No.  He was a goody two-shoes.  You think he was all the time? 
[00:39:00]  His entire life, yes.  He was on Long Island, so he might have gone through that Long Island phase in his teens,  maybe, where he was drunk and driving and out with his friends, you know, like me.  You're saying Sean Hannity must have gone through a phase where he was drunk and driving.  I did just say that, didn't I?  Okay, wow, okay.  You're a younger guy, man.  That was part of the culture on Long Island.  Drunk driving.  Yes!  Okay.  The older people listening to this are shaking their heads yes right now.  Yes.  That's what is unbelievable.  Just as some neighborhoods, the kids would ride their bikes and hopscotch and perhaps 
[00:39:30]  play Ringolivio.  So, we would drunk drive.  Yeah, we'd definitely need a better mic recorder.  It's terrible.  You know what I noticed?  Was someone's cell phone being picked up on the recorder?  Is that what it was?  I think I heard of them.  I don't know.  We could do way better than that as a show.  Yes!  You know what I noticed?  We couldn't help ourselves.  We had to do radio because we just did a half hour to 40 minutes on a stage where they  didn't record anything. 
[00:40:00]  They didn't record anything.  So then we'd go back to the green room like, somebody turn on a recorder!  We have things to say that have to be recorded for prosperity.  Right.  You can hear us.  We went into radio mode.  Yeah.  We just couldn't help ourselves.  And then finally, one more cut from backstage last night.  And I just got involved at the end of this.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  I think it continues the discussion of drinking and driving.  Yeah.  And if Hannity was a goody two-shoes.  No, he was too much of a goody two-shoes.  He doesn't understand.  No, I see it as he grew up on Long Island. 
[00:40:30]  That's Mr. Imus.  I see it as he grew up on Long Island.  Do you think Sean Hannity ever had a wild side?  They were really asking.  They just said that they think that Sean Hannity, when he was a child, or not when he was a child,  when he was younger, he used to drink and drive.  Well, Long Island, you would drink and drive and just, you know, have fun.  It's always guys like that are just real freaks, you know?  You think?  Oh, absolutely.  You think he had a wild side?  Oh, absolutely.  I think he does now.  You think he does?  Like, keeps it hidden?  Keeps it under wraps?  I think you're tied up interns on a weekend.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  I think he wears panties when he's doing his show at Fox.  Can you check for the panties tonight, Anthony?  I'll give a look.  All right.  Good luck, Anthony.  Get out of here.  We're not supposed to be wearing it today.  Yeah, really.  What are you doing?  There you go.  I didn't see any panties, by the way.  No?  Yeah.  You didn't see panty lines?  I didn't see any panty lines or anything.  I like that.  As a matter of fact, Sean Hannity wears the most beat-up jeans and sneakers.  Oh, I saw that.  With his suit jacket, but he's sitting behind that desk.  Yeah.  So he looks all official.  Like, you'd think he's wearing an entire suit. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  But he's just wearing the jacket and the nice shirt, and then he stands up, and the lower  half's just a wreck.  It's a mess.  His sneakers are really, like, kind of old.  He's comfy.  And they look like they might smell.  I don't know.  You know that?  I don't know about that.  But, you know, the type of sneakers.  They've been around too long.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  You did well on Hannity last night.  They didn't give you much time, though.  No, it didn't give me much time.  And then, you know, the lib sitting next to me, she was a little bit lippy.  The blonde?  Yeah, she wouldn't shut up.  I tried a couple of times to really launch myself in, which I don't normally do on those 
[00:42:00]  shows, because it is a give and take, a back and forth.  So you kind of wait and pick your spots.  But she wouldn't shut up, so I tried to launch myself in at one point.  And, wow, she just shut me down.  She wouldn't stop talking.  Now you know how I felt on Letterman.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm just fucking with you.  Maybe she was just extremely nervous and just kept talking.  Well, maybe.  Maybe that was it.  Now you know how it feels. 
[00:42:30]  I'm fucking with you.  Oh, shit.  But you made the, one of my favorite news sites, and I think, once again, I've got to  thank Andy Levy.  Oh.  Mediite.  Really?  Yeah, because they go, they just take a look at everybody.  Yeah.  I like that.  That is pretty cool.  I don't like taking the one angle.  Yeah.  I don't like just going to MSNBC or Fox.  Like, Mediite, they give you a little MSNBC.  Mediite?  Yeah, because it's media.  Is it two I's in a row?  Now I've got to remember, because it's spelled weird. 
[00:43:00]  Media?  Oh, okay.  So it's M-E-D-I-A-I-T-E dot com, I believe.  Mediite.  And they got videos from all over the place.  And, you know, you get maybe a Jon Stewart video, then you get a Rush Limbaugh video.  Yeah.  And then you got, you know, you know the deal.  So it's a little bit of everything.  I think so.  And I like it.  And you made the site.  Oh, really?  You didn't even know that.  Basically saying you were agreeing with Sean Hannity, and then there's Broad.  There's Broad.  It was good enough that they picked up on it and decided to, I think they either have 
[00:43:30]  the video of her babbling or a quick article on it.  Yeah.  She, well, you know, she was going off and she's a lefty.  So it was a good exchange.  And Hannity gets this attitude sometimes when these liberals are talking, where he's just  like, really?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  And then what?  Like, he gets this thing.  It's like, holy shit, he's getting kind of edgy with this girl.  Well, it sounds like he doesn't want any lefties on a show at all. 
[00:44:00]  And it seems...  He likes it.  He likes the combat thing there.  But I think sometimes when, like, Jimmy's on the show or when I'm on the show, he likes  kind of, like, really sticking it to the people.  Yeah.  And being like, oh, yeah?  Oh, doing his brackets?  Yeah.  The president was doing his brackets 31 days after the Libyan thing, you know, kicks  up.  He's finally decided he's going to, you know, chime in with something.  Really?  And she's talking.  He's like, really?  And it's funny because it's like, it's one of the tactics from this show. 
[00:44:30]  So...  He gets really mad.  It's kind of odd to see.  It just sucked.  You guys didn't have a lot of time.  They introduced you in, like, 52.  Yeah.  He had a Newt Gingrich interview.  Past the hour.  Too much Newt.  And there was a lot of news they had to get to and shit.  That Shep Smith is going to come back glowing in the fucking dark and with zero sleep.  I think the radiation is the only thing keeping him awake.  You go to the news and you watch, you know, Fox News for your Japan news and he's always 
[00:45:00]  on.  Yeah.  It's light out.  He's on.  It's dark out.  He's on.  Yeah.  It's dusk in Japan.  He's on.  Yeah.  He's...  And he's real close, isn't he?  And he should...  Yeah.  He...  I bet...  Is that you or me?  He's going to have some kind of problems.  Um, that wasn't me.  Something danged.  I heard that.  Something dinged.  Something ring-a-did-did.  Something's done.  Something's done.  Well, it might have been me.  Yeah, but I just like doing...  I like doing that show.  And, uh, by the way, I'm on Red Eye tonight. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, cool.  It's kind of a Fox weekend for me.  I think Red Eye might be my speed.  Red Eye's good.  Red Eye's good.  They have a little more fun and laugh.  They just goof on shit.  Yeah.  I got, uh...  I got Hannity introducing you.  Oh.  Because once again, you have to deal with the OP question.  I know.  Tell them to just shut up.  It's become this thing.  Oh, it really has...  Well, that's just it.  It has become a running gag.  I don't think I can hold my own on Fox News. 
[00:46:00]  You know, I'll be honest.  You just got to sit there and, like, fucking chime in.  You chime in every so often.  Eh, whatever.  And he, the co-host of the OP and Anthony show on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Anthony, uh, Kumi is here.  Is that how you say it?  Yeah, that's good.  I know his name.  Ant, Anthony.  I grew up with that.  Kumi or Kumi.  I'm like, I don't care.  You don't know.  You don't care.  That's fine.  We just did an event with you and OP and Imus.  Imus.  Yeah, it was fun.  Don Imus.  We sat there and talked about Imus.  Imus interviewed us. 
[00:46:30]  And, uh, I was like, why are we even here?  And OP said he's got to come on the program.  We're going to...  Yeah, he actually fessed up and said he's finally going to come on and do your show.  I'm very happy.  Please don't hold your breath.  Oh, really?  You might suffocate.  Oh, boy.  We'll see.  Right on, brother.  Right on.  Yeah, because I was just...  He's like, why isn't he coming on my show?  Right on, brother.  Why?  I, uh, I forgot to tell you.  You rushed out with Sean to do his show.  And I hung around with Imus because I haven't talked to him in a while, you know, face to face. 
[00:47:00]  And, uh, he was, like, ranting and raving about your voices.  Oh, that's cool.  He's like, oh, man, he does...  I almost am trying to do Imus because I was talking to him, but he's like, uh, he does  the best impression of me.  And he said, Rob Bartlett, he's stupid.  He can't do me after all these years.  Stupid.  I like Rob, but he can't do me.  Sucks at voices.  He said...  You know what was really fucking cool was being up on that stage and Imus doing the interview  and making Imus just crack the fuck up was kind of like, holy shit, that's cool, you 
[00:47:30]  know?  You kind of feel like, eh, I'm doing something.  You were kind of brown-nosing because...  Yeah, of course I was.  You did Imus, so you got Imus on your side, and then you did Reagan to get Hannity on your  side.  I had to do that one because...  Those were the two voices you picked yesterday.  And I've been around long enough to go, this motherfucker.  The second Hannity brought up Reagan, all that I was thinking is, how could I fit the  dumb impression in, because I know the audience was older, so they would have gotten the whole 
[00:48:00]  bit.  And it was kind of a, how did you get into radio, and it turned into how Hannity got  into political radio, and he goes, you know, listening to Ronald Reagan and stuff.  So I just kind of did a quick thing of like, you know, I came to Sean in a dream.  And, you know, the crowd liked it.  They liked the old school Ronnie impression.  And whenever you could drag out an impression of someone that's been dead for years and make  it pertinent, what are you going to do?  All right.  I think we've made it to our first break.  We've got a busy show today. 
[00:48:30]  We've got Rogan and Ari.  And Ari.  I can never say his last name.  I like Ari a lot.  They're coming in at 8 o'clock to talk UFC and other things.  And then Chuck Liddell coming in at 8.30.  Nice.  Yeah.  And then Penn and possibly Teller.  Yeah.  I'm hearing Penn and Teller coming on.  What's cool was Penn wasn't even booked for the show today, but he's in town, and he got  a hold of us and said, I want to stop by and say hi to the guys.  I love when that happens.  Yeah.  No stupid publicist and all that crap.  He just wants to stop by and say hi. 
[00:49:00]  Well, I did have an encounter yesterday walking back from John's Hog.  I was going down 49th, and I see Penn and Teller walking down the sidewalk coming at me.  You know, Penn's a big guy.  He's very visible.  He's a giant.  You know him.  He's got a look.  Very distinct look.  Yeah.  So, uh, he's walking past me, and, um, I go, uh, I go, hey, Penn.  And I just hear, you know, we got to go to the serious club. 
[00:49:30]  And he just blew me off.  Really?  He just walked right past me, didn't fucking say a word, no eye contact.  I'm like, oh, God.  I thought.  I thought you told me you talked to him.  No, I said I saw him.  Oh, jeez.  We got to bring that up.  Not only did I see him, I was completely blown off by him when I said, hey, Penn.  Like, I thought he was going to go, hey, how you doing?  A quick, you know, sidewalk one of those, hey, what are you doing?  Hey, uh, be on the show tomorrow or something.  Yeah.  And introduce me, maybe, you know, say hi to Teller. 
[00:50:00]  And then we're all on our way.  Not a big hold-up thing if you're in a hurry.  Did he hear you, you think?  I don't know.  He obviously didn't recognize you, because he was too busy doing his thing.  Now, to his credit, perhaps, I wasn't wearing my hat.  Uh-huh.  So maybe that was, you know, kind of a thing.  But come on.  Hey, Penn.  Oh, I can't wait to bring it up.  I do the radio show.  He's been on plenty of times.  We sat here three feet apart from each other many times, talking about a lot of things.  And hey, Penn, I got the blow off. 
[00:50:30]  We'll bring it up when he gets in here.  Yes, we will.  By the way, I took a few pictures last night and a quick video on the stage, but I don't know.  I wanted to videotape the whole thing, knowing that no one else was.  I know.  Just get something.  So I think I got like 40 seconds, and then I realized, all right, turn this fucking thing  off and have a little fun.  It's a little tidbit.  But if you go to my Twitter, you got some pics and a quick video, OP Radio.  And I think E-Rock's got a whole bunch of pictures he's going to post soon.  I don't know where.  We'll have that info later.  What?  You got it? 
[00:51:00]  No, he's on the shitter.  I was just going to tell you he's taking a shit.  So I don't know where they are.  Oh, shit.  Oh, and to wrap up the whole discussion about last night, Sean Hannity didn't recognize E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yes.  This is really important.  Because E-Rock likes us to think that he's kind of...  A mover and a shaker.  A mover and a shaker.  He's in there.  That he's connected to all the radio guys and stuff.  Right.  And he's always getting to me going, hey, Sean Hannity says hi. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, Sean Hannity wrote me.  He wants to know when you're doing a show.  Sean is thinking, you know, maybe he'll call about Obama.  I was talking to Sean and he said...  Thank you.  There's a lot of...  I was talking to Sean or Sean said or Sean this, Sean that.  He made it seem like to all of us who work here that they used to work together.  That he used to work with Sean Hannity.  Right.  And like, so they were boys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boys.  I'm not going to lie to you.  That's my boy.  I thought...  I was kind of impressed. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  That E-Rock kind of knows Sean a little better than...  The young go-getter.  ...than most people in this business.  I mean, walking into the Hard Rock, I was like, E-Rock, you know, maybe you could help  hook up...  I could get a soundbite from Sean Hannity.  Right, right.  You could help hook that up.  Yeah.  And I knew that wasn't going to happen because we were sitting in the green room there.  This was so embarrassing for E-Rock.  I already got the deuce chills.  I know.  Because I know.  Go ahead, Sean.  Anthony, you were there.  Opie, I believe you were there too.  Mr. Imus was in there.  Uh-huh.  And Sean Hannity walked in and he said hi to you, Anthony, you, Opie. 
[00:52:30]  He said hi to Imus.  And then he said hi to all of us.  It's me, E-Rock, and Roland, who was there for some reason.  I don't know why.  Oh, just hanging out.  But he said hi to us as a group.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  And he sat down and he looked at the three of us.  He knew we were from the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And said, so which one of you is the one who writes me?  Oh.  And I went, in my head, I'm going, what? 
[00:53:00]  It's like, wait a minute.  And E-Rock raises his hand and goes, that's me.  And he points to him and he goes, oh, okay, uh, Nagel, is that it?  Nagel.  I'm going, what?  It was so embarrassing.  You're supposed to know this guy, Sean.  We're all looking like, oh.  Sean doesn't know who he was.  Sean doesn't know E-Rock.  Not a clue.  E-Rock is bothersome to Sean Hannity.  Oh, he was just another little fat man in the room.  Yeah.  Oh, it was, it really was brutal. 
[00:53:30]  Also, getting this in, E-Rock is a mover and a shaker.  When he moves, the earth shakes.  Oh.  That's, uh.  He's not even here to defend himself.  He's shitting.  He's on the shitter, as you said.  I believe he's on the shitter.  Oh, boy.  When he asked me to come in and cover for him, I've never seen him move that fast.  Oh, wow.  He really had to go.  Yeah.  This is a big 7 a.m. shit for Eric.  He's assaulting that toilet right now.  Oh, boy.  That toilet is being assaulted.  You think Eric had too much at the hard rock last night? 
[00:54:00]  He might have.  Oh, boy.  There should be crime tape up around the stall.  I love, I love that.  Hey, uh, Terry Schiavo.  They removed the feeding tube six years ago today.  Do we have any of our-  How's she doing?  She's, uh.  Do we have any of our Schiavo material today?  I love the Schiavo.  Yeah, I think we're going to come back with something.  All right, we'll come back with something.  We got a bunch of stuff in honor of that.  Yes.  Event.  Eric's back.  Nagel's here.  Ah.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  All right, we'll take a break.  Nagel, gotta eat.  Yeah, and we'll, uh, and we'll continue. 
[00:54:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On the virus.  The Sirius XM.  Checking out Opie and Anthony.  We got a busy show today.  We got Joe Rogan coming in at 8 o'clock with Harry.  And, uh, Chuck Liddell at 8.30.  And then Penn and possibly Teller at 9.30. 
[00:55:00]  That'd be, uh, first for us.  You know, we were busy being out and about.  Sorry, I'm looking at the news.  Uh, uh, they keep just showing the same exact videos over and over again.  Yeah.  Of the nuclear power plant exploding with the big chunks in the sky.  Big explosion.  And they love showing that.  Even though they have a lot of new videos, they like that one video of the tsunami with  that black water of death.  Yeah, the goop.  The goopy one. 
[00:55:30]  The goop.  Where are we at with this whole thing?  Um, I don't know.  They seem to have gotten some fire trucks there.  They're just trying to spray it with water with many ways.  But didn't...  Many different ways.  Didn't Michu Kaku...  See, sometimes I don't know if the listeners are fucking with me or not.  Because a few people wrote and said that Michu Kaku was on as an expert.  Yeah.  Saying, you know, what they're doing is like fighting a forest fire with a, what, a water  gun or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's what he said.  It's like, don't even bother. 
[00:56:00]  You can't cool this fucking thing down with the way you're doing it.  Dropping water from a helicopter.  Yeah, that...  I think they tried that.  I don't think they're really thinking that worked well.  They just sent a bunch of firemen there with some pumper trucks.  And they're trying to run a power line so they could get the pumps working again and  just start gushing some water into that fucking thing.  But who the hell knows?  It's still up in the air.  Some planes landed here from Tokyo and they were checking the air filters of the plane 
[00:56:30]  and some of them had some raised levels of radiation.  Really?  And some people had some radiation on them.  Really?  Yeah.  Actually, some of the security measures they have at some of these airports, when the planes  came in, they detected radiation on the planes.  Wow.  Not that much, but it's like, wow, that's fucking taken off from like Tokyo.  Yeah, kind of creepy.  Yeah.  A little odd. 
[00:57:00]  Hmm.  Well, that's what you get, though, when you use that atomic energy.  We really don't have a choice at this point.  No.  We have to use atomic energy.  What a crazy week, though.  And then Libya.  Wow.  What the hell's going on over there?  I don't know.  What is going on over there?  Well, I guess they said...  Now we're finally getting involved?  Yeah.  All right.  After pretty much all the rebels have been fucking blown to pieces with Qaddafi's Air 
[00:57:30]  Force, they decide no-fly zone.  How they're going to enforce that, though, is, I don't know, beyond me.  Because the rebel guys, they're not very good.  They have some anti-aircraft guns and they shoot at shit.  Something tells me they'd shoot at anything they see in the air.  Yeah.  So, like, what happens with the pilots that are trying to, like, defend them, and they'd  just be like, oh, just blasting at anything in the sky? 
[00:58:00]  Someone's got to tell them, like, look, you've got to be cool.  How the fuck did Qaddafi turn this thing around?  We thought we had an Egypt thing happen here.  Yeah.  Because he's bloodthirsty.  A little tougher than Egypt, obviously, because he's way more aggressive.  But how did he turn it around?  Weren't we watching the last days of him?  Because he decided he was just going to be ruthless and kill a fuckload of his own people.  A lot of his boys, you know, they backed down and left them and retired or whatever the 
[00:58:30]  hell they did.  Yep.  But he still was able to turn this thing around.  Yeah.  I guess, from what I heard, too, the rebels don't really know how to fight.  So they weren't digging trenches and they weren't taking cover when these planes would  fly over.  And then they'd just get blown apart.  There'd just be some guy in the back of a Toyota pickup truck with an anti-aircraft rig  trying to hit these fucking planes.  Yeah.  Why is it always a Toyota truck? 
[00:59:00]  Those Toyota trucks.  Nissan pickup trucks.  And by the way, in every video game, they're the easiest thing to blow up.  Yeah.  Is that dumb, oh, when you see the Toyota truck come ripping around the corner, you're  just like, oh, I got this.  I got this.  Is Anderson Cooper okay?  I hope so.  We all worry about him.  We worry, yeah.  We sure do.  I don't know.  He looks stressed.  His hair is completely white.  I think he's scared.  Let me go to Anthony in Baltimore. 
[00:59:30]  Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I was just watching CNN last night, and they made me feel real good about this whole Japan  thing, because they said Anderson Cooper was over there, and that he was specifically  keeping the Japanese government honest with their statements about the nuclear power plant.  So, you know, CNN is saving the world every day.  That's correct.  Why was Anderson Cooper keeping them honest?  Yeah.  They were saying that the Japanese were downplaying the severity of the nuclear, the radiation leaks  and whatnot, and Anderson Cooper was asking them questions and making them make a more 
[01:00:00]  honest statement.  Well, you know what?  Anderson Cooper is the guy that would get up someone's ass and really try to get the  truth out of them.  Right?  I would believe.  I would believe.  It's a figure of speech, right?  Much quicker than anything to get from anybody from CNN.  You thought about that last night, didn't you?  You couldn't wait to use that to that.  No, no.  I just popped in my head when this guy said that Anderson Cooper was...  It's terrific.  All right, Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  Anderson Cooper, keeping everyone honest.  Thanks for the softball, my friend.  A little off topic.  Well, way off topic.  Remember when Matthew McConaughey called our show?  I certainly do.  And you talked about movie posters the whole time?  Movie posters.  I remember thinking while he was on the phone, why would an A-list celebrity call us like that?  Uh-oh.  His movie is a dud-a-roo.  A dud-a-roo?  I'm calling it a dud-a-roo.  Is it really?  And that's why he called. 
[01:01:00]  We only get the really big stars if they're desperate for marketing, knowing that they got a dud-a-roo.  When did we get Richard Dreyfuss?  Poseidon.  Poseidon.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  We could go back to every big celebrity we've ever had.  We had Buscemi, right?  No.  We never had Buscemi.  Was it Defoe?  Yeah, we had Willem.  Willem Defoe.  Willem Defoe.  And I kind of liked that movie.  It was the one with Mick Foley in it, right?  Yeah.  I don't even remember the name anymore.  And I remember thinking, why is Willem Defoe sitting on our couch? 
[01:01:30]  Willem Defoe.  We're all huge fans.  Yeah.  We only get the A-listers if they're promoting a dud-a-roo.  A dud-a-roo.  Yeah, man.  And the paper's not...  The Lincoln lawyer is not...  And not being kind to the Lincoln lawyer.  What is Rotten Tomatoes saying about the Lincoln lawyer?  Which stuff's saying?  They say, we don't like the movie poster.  Yeah.  He's not leaning back-to-back with a girl.  But he is leaning on the Lincoln.  He's leaning against the Lincoln.  He really is.  Yeah.  The guy can't stop leaning against his co-star. 
[01:02:00]  In this thing, it's a car.  But...  Giving it good reviews?  What?  What is wrong with the paper I was reading this morning?  Wow.  That's a little different than what I just read.  How many reviews are there?  Give me your papers over there.  Yeah.  Because my papers are in the shitter.  You got 47 fresh and 11 rotten.  Whoa.  Average audience says 3.3 out of 5.  Dude, I...  I don't see dud-a-roo there. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, wow.  All right, we want...  That looks like successor-oo.  All right, then hold on a minute.  Then what was he calling us for?  Oh, hello.  Hey-oh, let me see.  What happened?  Entertainment Weekly.  What'd they give it?  A B.  A B?  All right.  Here we go.  Lincoln is a real clunker.  This is the Daily News.  Oh.  See, that's why Rotten Tomatoes...  I just got caught doing what I bitched about.  That's true.  Rotten Tomatoes is great because they get, you know, all the reviews from all the major newspapers, 
[01:03:00]  so you get a better idea of what the movie is.  Uh-huh.  If you just read the Daily News, you think this movie sucks.  You think it's...  Dutteroo.  But Roland ran this in.  It's a B in Entertainment Weekly.  Yep.  And Rotten Tomatoes giving it 81% positive reviews.  But this douchebag in the Daily News, now I'm going to call him a douchebag, gave it one star.  Hmm.  If they don't get interviews, Daily News, they give it a little braid.  Huh?  What did he just say?  I don't know.  Roland, what?  He said the Daily News gave it a braid.  No, I said if they don't get the interviews, they give it a bad braid. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, see, I heard the Daily News gave it a braid.  Yeah, I heard braid, too.  I love Roland.  You can't understand him.  There's a reason potboiler paperbacks don't make good movies.  There's too much outlandish plot, even for Hollywood.  Yes, John Grisham translates, but judging from The Lincoln Lawyer, adapted from a best-selling series by Michael Connolly, similar writers like Jonathan Kellerman and Dave.  This guy already lost me in his fucking review.  Basically, he's saying it's a clunker, but it looks like he's one of the only ones saying that. 
[01:04:00]  So now I owe Matthew McConaughey and this movie Lincoln Lawyer an apology.  Look at you.  See?  I did exactly what I bitch about.  I looked at it and said, okay, one star.  This movie's got one out of five.  This guy really has a problem with Matthew McConaughey.  Maybe it's just Matthew McConaughey.  So he's taking it personal that maybe he didn't get an interview with the guy or something.  Maybe he doesn't like his movie posters.  And what have you heard about Paul?  McCartney, dead.  I heard good stuff about that.  I didn't even hear about this movie until I opened the paper, and that's getting really good reviews. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, yeah, Simon Pegg, and it's the Shaun of the Dead guys.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And who's doing the voice of the alien?  That I don't remember.  Is it Will Ferrell?  I think it's Seth.  Seth Rogen is doing the voice of the alien.  Oh, yeah?  A movie called Paul I didn't even hear about.  We should have probably interviewed some people from this movie.  It looks like it's going to be kind of cool.  Well, we have had the guys on, and they weren't really stellar.  I was very disappointed.  Oh, Simon Pegg.  Simon Pegg.  True. 
[01:05:00]  Please.  I love the movies.  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, I was very disappointed.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  It was the proverbial pulling of the teeth.  Jason Bateman's in it as well.  Oh.  So Lincoln Lawyer looks like it's going to be okay.  All right.  Hey, so then maybe we are turning things around and getting A-listers for real movies now.  That's crazy.  But Simon Pegg was good, but it was the day after Armas got fired, so they waited an hour  and 40 minutes in the green room before they got on. 
[01:05:30]  Oh.  So they took it personally.  Oh.  And then Jimmy said some words that hurt their old publicist feelings.  Oh.  What were the words?  What?  The C word?  No, the publicist was gay.  Oh.  Oh.  Something about a publicist being.  Well, but he kept saying that word over and over again.  Oh.  Did he use the F word for gay?  Uh.  Oh, yeah.  Because they don't like that.  No, he used that a lot.  I don't like that. 
[01:06:00]  And then during the interview, Jimmy goes, how much am I moving?  And then he goes, am I angry right now because I just got fired?  And they're like, oh, okay.  And then you know what was going on.  Oh, I didn't know that.  It was like, yeah.  Well, fuck it.  I ain't giving him a note.  Do we make your job tougher, Roland?  Oh, no.  It's easy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I noticed he ran in here with the Matthew McConaughey thing.  Yeah, yeah.  He ran in.  Look, I found it.  I found a place where they gave it a B.  He gave it a B.  How's Kaku doing today?  What? 
[01:06:30]  What?  You've talked to him?  What?  Have you talked to Michu?  He said, I will call you in the fourth wind of the second moon.  I don't know.  I'm going to go back to take a poo-poo.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  One of the pictures I took, I was trying to get a picture of Sean Hannity leaving the bathroom awkwardly.  And Roland looks like such a creep in this picture.  Everyone is commenting about you.  Oh, really?  What were you thinking?  Nothing. 
[01:07:00]  People are convinced you want to rape Sean Hannity or something.  I was looking for the food.  There was nothing back there.  There was no food for you?  There was nothing.  No.  I thought like a little platter or something.  I thought there'd be a spread.  A little something-something, right?  A type of spread.  At least it did.  Or some of that chicken made with Captain Crunch, whatever the hell they make it with.  They still do that one.  I have no idea.  What is it?  That's playing Hollywood.  So your goal is to get Michi Kaku back in our good graces.  Yeah, because I told him we got brand new phone lines. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  Phone lines broke at the time.  Call him today.  Yeah, he's doing Letterman next week.  Really?  Yeah.  He's blowing up.  Call him.  Today could be the day because the Japanese thing is kind of just sitting there right now.  Is this excited, Guy?  Which one?  In the middle, TV?  Japan.  There's either no water or virtually no water putting us back into this situation.  He's got pots and pans on a stove trying to tell us about it.  How do we resolve that?  Tell us about it.  Well, of course, we can add water.  And this is exactly what the Japanese are trying to do right now. 
[01:08:00]  He's got pasta in a fucking pan.  They're trying to get water into that pool any way they can, even by helicopter dump.  All to avoid a nuclear catastrophe.  Karen, Christine.  And, of course, that will cause a fire in your kitchen if it were the experiment.  But the problem here is the radioactivity.  That is what's just so dangerous about this.  What did they just do?  Did you just see the fact that they haven't been able, you know, still to get a handle on that part of it?  So we're going to continue to watch those developments.  Alan, thanks.  Yeah, you're bims.  Top stories now.  Danger rising around Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant. 
[01:08:30]  More broads telling me the news.  Bims trying to fucking describe a nuclear power.  Look, I know women can be intelligent, but they're all dolled up.  Right now they're getting their makeup touched up for the next story.  Right now a makeup artist is right in front of them tapping their face with a little sponge.  I'm going to keep hammering the point home.  I want bedhead guy with a holy shit look on his face.  And what are they doing on CNN?  They're describing the nuclear power plant with pots and pans? 
[01:09:00]  It was a guy in a kitchen with a pot and some pasta thrown into the pot, and then he put  it on the stove, and, you know, obviously that would burn, so he goes, you know, you add  water, and he added water to it.  No shit!  He was doing a cooking show segment based on the nuclear disaster.  And was the pasta the rods?  Yeah, those would be the rods.  The rods.  Rods.  I thought it was an infomercial. 
[01:09:30]  I know, that's what it looked like.  Because you said, is that the guy that yells and screams loud?  I'm like, okay, an infomercial guy, we could do this for a minute.  And then I noticed it's CNN.  Yeah.  And they're describing the situation at the power plant with pots and pans and spaghetti.  Well, double the fuel rods, just pay separate shipping and handling.  That's scam.  Let me go to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, Opie.  Anthony, according to this morning's Los Angeles Times Online, they're saying that the containment 
[01:10:00]  pool for the rods is cracked, and it can't hold water.  Oh, boy.  Is that a bad thing?  No, that's a good thing, I would say.  That way it bursts into flames, and we get rid of it in 10,000 years.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I'm very comfortable.  The longest journey starts with one step.  So if we just let it go and wait 10,000 years, you know, one day turns into two, turns into  a week.  You know how quickly, like, a year goes by? 
[01:10:30]  Just take 10,000 of those.  Earth years?  That's nothing.  It's nothing.  We'll be long gone.  And then, finally, the place will be normal again.  Yes.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let me go to Drew in Jersey.  A lot of questions coming in today.  Drew?  You know about the supermoon that's supposed to be happening tomorrow?  Supermoon.  Well, yeah, and this is supposed to do what?  Well, the supermoon's going to fuck some things up, but it's going to happen on the 22nd or 23rd. 
[01:11:00]  I'm holding to that.  Yeah.  You need a couple days of the supermoon, and then the shit starts hitting the fan.  Yeah.  I don't know exactly what, but something big's going to happen on the 22nd or 23rd.  Supermoon.  Yes.  You think that's going to be the little detonator for something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you know about the supermoon?  What does it mean?  I don't know much about it.  I've never heard of the supermoon.  It doesn't mean the moon is closer than it's ever been or been for a very long time.  Yeah, and it's a full moon.  So the tides. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, maybe the high tides.  Are we going to get that?  A little higher.  A little higher.  A little more flooding in Jersey?  A little flooding.  Is that what's going to happen?  I don't know.  I don't know what the supermoon is.  See, if I didn't hang up on Michukaku, that would be a great question for him.  The supermoon is click.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Dude, you've got to remember.  Yeah.  When we were fucking with Michukaku, nothing happened yet.  Yeah.  We called him about the guy that wanted the $10,000 to make his own nuclear reaction.  Yeah, we were trying to figure out what kind of reaction it was and is it feasible. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  We figured we would talk to him, so we wasted it.  We wasted a good phone call.  We wasted it.  And then the shit hit the fan the next day and we could have used Michukaku.  So I have horrible timing.  What do you want from me?  Yeah, we wasted a good physicist.  We did.  We're going to have to interview new ones.  Yeah.  We need a new physicist.  If you're a physicist, call us.  We'll interview you so you can be the expert for the show.  And a good popular one can't be easy to find. 
[01:12:30]  Like Michukaku is now, you know, people know who this guy is.  He's worked his way up to be a known physicist.  And in the world of physicist-y, in the world of physicist-ing, it's very hard to be, you know, a rock star in that world.  True.  Yeah, when we first had him on the show.  Tyson Degrassi?  Yeah.  Who is he?  What?  I don't know Tyson.  Is he a physicist-ist? 
[01:13:00]  He's a physicist-ist.  Is he good, though?  Yes.  We need a good one.  I don't want to hack physicist.  You know that guy?  This guy.  Oh, that guy.  Let me see that guy.  I know that guy.  Well, look, I already got a problem.  Yeah, obviously.  Obviously, he's an expert on black holes.  Oh, no, that physicist-ist.  You don't want that kind of physicist-ist?  I don't know.  I'm not familiar with his material.  I hate those words where you don't know how they end.  Physicist-ist.  Physicist-ist might be one of those.  The plural for breast is always tough. 
[01:13:30]  Breast-ist-ist.  Breast.  Breast.  Breast.  See what I mean?  It just continues.  Yeah, yeah.  Ghost-s.  Ghost-s.  Ghost-s.  Ghost-s.  Ghost-s.  Ghost-s.  Ghost-s.  Yeah, it's that whole thing.  Bicycle enthusiasts.  Ah, that motherfucker.  Who?  Plexi has started playing advertisements over my photos.  Fuck those guys.  Someone help me out.  Where else could I go? 
[01:14:00]  They're playing frog.  Why frog?  Why frog?  And my pictures don't look as good on Plexi.  What's that about?  Do they fucking squash him?  No.  Do they squash him?  Maybe they compress him down.  It's shit.  And now they got advertisements before my pictures?  Wow, that's fucked.  I've hit that level?  Yeah.  I'm not fucking advertising for nobody.  It's a compliment.  YouTube wants me to do that shit.  I'm like, no.  Oh, really?  I just want my fucking videos up there.  Just want them out there, you know, and commercialize it, man. 
[01:14:30]  It's getting harder, to be honest with you.  Just click on it.  There's a few bucks to be made.  All you got to do is click on that little link.  I'm holding steady, but I'm starting to shake.  There's some offers coming in.  I'm like, ugh.  Fuck that with my photos, man.  No advertisements.  Where do I go?  Twit pick?  Yeah, they don't have it?  I don't know.  Plexi, I guess, is running advertisements.  I don't know.  I just pick whatever's there.  True.  It's like whatever's there. 
[01:15:00]  True, true, true.  I know it's the quality.  I'm not happy with the quality of my pictures.  Well, then fuck that.  We need top-of-the-line quality.  Hell fucking yeah.  All right.  Who knows about the supermoon?  We don't need a physicist.  We can figure this shit out on our own.  Can we?  Yes.  Our own research?  We're good at that on this show.  Brad in Rochester, tell us about the supermoon.  Number one, I'm by far not a physicist to this.  Yeah.  And I kind of got bored with my own take, but while I was waiting on hold, but what I'm 
[01:15:30]  saying is that with the supermoon, it doesn't matter the luminosity.  You guys keep bringing up the fact that it's going to be a full moon.  That doesn't have an effect on gravitational pull.  It's just the distance, how close.  You know what I'm saying?  So you're saying the phases of the moon don't have any effect on tides?  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's only how close it is.  It's the distance.  Then why are the tides affected when the moon is full?  I'm very suspicious. 
[01:16:00]  I am.  Are you suspicious?  I am a little suspicious of the fact that I do believe the moon's phases have some kind  of effect.  And I don't know why either, because all it is is light reflecting off of the moon from  the sun.  Exactly.  So it shouldn't, but I think you're full of booty.  Oh, I think it's coincidence, because when the moon is full, it's probably, no, no, no, 
[01:16:30]  that doesn't work either.  The moon's got a weird orbit.  It's very odd.  Well, how are we going to figure out what the super moon's all about?  The super moon.  Well, not from this guy, apparently.  I'm punching out.  Oh, wait, wait.  You guys had a good story up there recently.  What did we have?  I was trying to get to the other day, but we had too much going on.  Some woman's in trouble for paying the babysitter in pot or something?  Yeah.  What a great story.  What an idiot. 
[01:17:00]  What I don't understand about this, how did the media find out about this?  If you're a babysitter that likes pot, and the mom or the dad goes, hey, instead of giving  you cash, you know, I'd like a little pot, too.  I'm just going to pay him pot.  The only thing that makes sense is that the kid, the babysitter, got busted and flew her  in to her parents.  You know what I'm saying?  She walks in the door, mom finds a dime bag, whatever, and says, where the hell did you  get this?  They paid me.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:17:30]  The babysitter obviously was cool with the situation, but I'm guessing that she got,  Okay.  The babysitter shouldn't have ratted.  It's just like, oh, I found it.  Yeah.  Found it.  The babysitter panicked.  Right.  She panicked and blew her in.  Yeah.  It goes back to when, you know, you got that one kid banging the French teacher, and then  you got an asshole that fucking spoils it for anybody.  And rats it out to their little mommy.  Motherfucker.  Right.  Right.  They're jealous. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  No, I don't even think it's jealousy.  They just got to tell?  They got to tell.  I mean, they're little rats.  I'm going to tell.  And if you got a kid in your high school that's banging teachers, keep it to yourself.  He's a hero.  That's cool as all hell.  Yes.  Or blackmail.  See if you can get in there.  Well, I've heard that happen.  There have been some stories where the guy's been like, look, I'm going to tell.  You better tell that chick to give me a blowjob.  You know, you learn to keep quiet when you get older, but I think if you're 16, 17, and 
[01:18:30]  you're banging the hot French teacher.  I keep saying the hot French teacher, because I had a really hot French teacher with the  French perfumes and the cleavage and all that.  Really?  She was a stereotypical French teacher.  Yes.  She had a big, hairy bush, I bet.  She was a blonde.  Yeah.  And, yeah, she was something, man.  I bet it was a big, matted-down bush, though.  Yeah, that's all right.  I would have taken a look.  Oh, of course.  But.  I had the stereotypical Italian teacher with a mustache. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, she was.  Okay.  Yeah, but, all right, so then you're 16 or 17, and you're banging the hot French teacher.  You're in a weird position.  You've got to tell people.  Yeah, of course.  But if you just keep it to yourself, you've got the greatest thing going.  Yeah.  So what do you do?  Impossible.  You've got to shut up about it.  Impossible at that age.  I think that's impossible at that age.  Yeah.  I really do.  All right.  No, I remember shutting up with Buzz.  Remember Buzz?  Yeah, yeah.  That chick that I was banging when I was in, like, fucking junior high. 
[01:19:30]  But it wasn't a teacher, which is really off limits.  No, it wasn't a teacher.  But it was, you know, she was an older woman for me.  She was, like, 19.  And, yeah, I didn't.  Because somebody could have said something, and then there would have been a problem.  But weren't you dying to tell somebody?  How old were you?  You were 12 or 13?  I was, like, 13, yeah.  13?  You're banging a 19-year-old?  Wow.  Yeah.  And you can't tell anyone?  No, I figured I'd just keep my mouth shut.  See, I would have told.  I would have had to brag to somebody. 
[01:20:00]  Well, I did tell one person.  Who?  He wasn't impressed.  Oh, Richard?  Yeah.  Did he tell Richard?  Yeah, I told Gay Richard.  Oh, that bummed him out.  That I was banging.  Do you remember what he said?  He just changed the subject.  Really?  Yeah, he just changed the subject.  He didn't start making Bobby Kelly sounds.  Did he know he was gay at that point?  No.  That's at the point I didn't know he was gay. 
[01:20:30]  Was that the first sign that he didn't like girls?  Wait a minute.  This just popped in my head now, too.  I do remember this.  Buzz, at one point, we were all hanging out drinking.  Hit on Richard.  No, wanted both of us to go upstairs and fuck her.  Like, put her on the rotisserie and shit.  Why didn't he, so he could take a peek at you naked?  I think the revulsion of a female form was so strong that even to fucking see the likes 
[01:21:00]  of me was just the worst.  So, so, but, but I remember him saying, like, he was just like, no, no, no, no, I don't.  And it was weird.  And he always had girls chasing him around.  Because, you know, he was the good looking kid and everything.  So girls were constantly chasing him around.  And I'm just fucking firing off every funny line and something, everything I could possibly  do.  To get a little attention.  I'm learning how to make drinks.  Like, I'm in the movie Cocktail.  I'm just like, anything I could do to get attention from these whores. 
[01:21:30]  And they're chasing after him.  And little did they know, you know.  And he didn't want any of it.  He wanted nothing.  He didn't even go that way at all?  Not a hint of him ever liking a girl.  He was not bi or anything.  He was completely homo.  Jesus.  Complete homo.  Does he realize what he was missing?  Smooth, wet vagina around his penis.  But he didn't like that.  That's what I always think, man. 
[01:22:00]  Do you realize what you're missing?  God, they're throwing themselves at you.  How stupid is that comment?  Throwing themselves at you.  I'm going to shake some of these gay guys.  Do you understand what you're missing?  God, it's wonderful.  What are you doing with that anal opening?  The vag is great.  That's okay if it's your birthday.  But, jeez.  Like, you would think they'd give it a whirl.  It's like, you know, yeah, it fucking feels good on the cock.  So, you know, you give the old fucking...  It's truly made for the cock. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  It's truly.  And, like, what's the deal where they would be, like, so, like, put off that they would not have sex with that wonderfulness that is the vagina?  That's why you want to shake them.  Do you realize what you're missing?  Come on, gay guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's something.  Eh, well, yeah, so Richard didn't want to have sex with Buzz, but I did tell him.  But Buzz sounds like she was awful.  The name just...  Buzz.  The visual I've had over the years... 
[01:23:00]  The name was Christine.  She wasn't awful?  She didn't look like a Buzz?  Oh, no, she was pretty awful.  She had a very kind of 70s voluptuous body.  That's not bad.  But, uh, the face was, uh...  Rough.  You know what her face looked like for those people out there that are Twilight Zone fans?  Remember the episode where the old guy was dying on Mardi Gras? 
[01:23:30]  And, um, he, he made his heirs, who were going to get his inheritance, wear these Mardi Gras masks for the whole night, or else they weren't going to get the inheritance.  I vaguely remember this episode.  And at midnight, he knew at midnight he was going to die.  And after he died, he knew they would take the masks off.  Okay.  So, he, uh, made them wear the masks, and they're all, this is stupid, blah, blah, blah.  And then midnight comes, he dies, and they go, great, now we got his money, fuck him, he's dead.  They take the mask off, and their faces looked like the masks they were wearing. 
[01:24:00]  It, like, molded their faces into the mask, so they had to walk around all ugly and pig-faced.  Buzz looked like the pig-faced mask.  Really?  Yes!  Oh, that sucks.  But she had a set of tits on her.  Oh, and she had youth on her side.  And an ass, and a big hairy bush.  I want to see what she looks like nowadays.  Oh, my God.  Just to go, you, do you like her?  Let me think.  I was about to say something really.  No, I don't even know her. 
[01:24:30]  I would love to see a picture just to go, you, fuck that.  She's probably an old battle axe now.  Oh, yeah, she's got to be.  Let me think.  Yeah.  You know how old she is.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Oh, God.  She was the go-to girl, though, with everybody.  Like, if you were horny and needed something, she was your go-to girl.  Oh, she was doing most of the neighborhood?  She was your go-to girl.  She was doing most of the boys.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't just you?  No, no.  Why would it just be me? 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  See, she was going to, you know, do Richard.  I think she was doing...  Did your pops pop that?  Chato Reyes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think my pops might have popped her.  Yeah?  Once, yeah.  Sharing broads with the pops.  I think.  God.  Yeah, I would say had to have been.  That's kind of weird to share a broad with your dad.  Yeah, it was, you know, it was the 70s, Opie.  It was a different time.  Yeah.  Which...  Well, you had a young father, too.  I say that all the time, which means nothing.  Right.  Oh, it's a different time.  You had a young father, though, as well. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  He was only 20-some-odd years older than you, right?  Cowboy.  20 years older, something like that.  Was it?  Something like that.  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, he had me when he was, like, in his early 20s.  Jesus.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  Good old Buzz.  Buzzaboo.  Last I heard, I did get an update when I was out in California years ago from my father's  wife or widow, whatever the fuck you call it after that.  And she said that Buzz went down to San Diego and married herself a sailor. 
[01:26:00]  She went and married herself a sailor, and she's living down in San Diego.  That's wonderful.  Good for you, Buzz.  Good for you, Buzz.  You go, Buzz!  I wonder if he walked in as she was blowing one of the local Capistrano townies and fucking  swept her off her feet like Officer and a Gentleman.  Right.  And fucking walked into his car. 
[01:26:30]  You go, Buzz!  There it is.  There it is.  Hey, Buzz, you were just sucking my cock.  What happened?  Buzz, get back here.  I was just fucking you.  She's wearing the hat on her head, this jism in her hair.  That whore.  Stupid whore.  You think she listens to the show?  I don't know who's listening to this show.  In my past.  Yeah, some people from my past, I just wonder if they listen.  I know. 
[01:27:00]  I wonder if ex-girlfriends listen.  I did get a Facebook message from an ex-girlfriend, that one, that chick Lisa that had the father  that called me my fine-feathered friend.  Sure, yeah.  Yeah, and she lives in Pennsylvania, she's been married, kids, teacher, like the whole  thing.  And I knew her when she was like 19.  I have an ex, I would love to rub it in her face, in her mom's face.  Absolutely.  When I, fuck it, I'll say the town and everything. 
[01:27:30]  When I was in Buffalo, I was, I was, I was, I was really into this girl.  Yeah.  And, uh, the mom basically convinced this girl, where's he going in his life?  You're not good enough.  Where's he going in his life?  I want, I want you to marry a rich guy.  Oh boy.  One of those.  And you know, I'm not a money guy.  I don't, I don't flaunt it or anything, but I would love to fucking just knock on the  door with my bank account.  Go look what I fucking did.  What have you done with your life?  That never works.  And I heard she got really fat cause I know a guy that was banging her when I was banging 
[01:28:00]  her.  Oh really?  And he, and they were supposedly only fucking friends, but this guy came clean, uh, many  years later when I saw him, where were we in Worcester doing one of those virus shows?  Oh shit.  He told you he was fucking her at the same time.  Yeah.  He was, he's on a TV show.  Oh really?  Yeah.  And I went, holy shit.  One of those home improvement shows.  I forgot which one now where they, they travel and they fucking, I don't know, make your  house better.  Fix a house up and then go.  Yeah.  I can show you the guy's, uh, uh, picture damn. 
[01:28:30]  And I ran into him.  I, I, I knew him from the old days.  We were both in Buffalo at the same time.  And I was, I guess I was supposedly going out with her and, and she was banging this  guy too.  And I was so stupid and naive.  I remember going over her house asking her mom, you know, where she is.  Oh, she's downstairs and she's sitting on, um, on the washing machine and the guy is  pretty much right in front of her.  And I'm like, Oh, Hey guys, what's going on?  And all like, Oh no, all like stupid.  And you know what was going on?  Like right before you came in now?  I know. 
[01:29:00]  Come on.  I'm not stupid now.  Oh dude.  Oh man.  And if I ever questioned, no man, we're just friends.  Yeah.  Just friends.  But he gave me an update that she's a big fat pig now and it made me very happy.  Very happy.  Cause she was also the one that after, after she didn't want me anymore, I started dating  other girls, but she didn't want me to date other girls.  Oh, that's, but she didn't want great arrangement.  She didn't want me, but she didn't want me dating other girls.  Fuck her.  And, and that's a small, uh, that's a small city that Buffalo.  So it got back to her. 
[01:29:30]  I was seeing this girl.  So that's the one that left the, the voicemails.  Oh, right.  Having sex with her old boyfriend that she swore she was done with.  Right.  Some fucking cokehead that ended up dying by the way.  Oh, but they left, uh, lots of wonderful, wonderful recordings on my, uh, my machine.  As they were having sex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've told that story many times.  You gave the, you gave the recording to some of her family members.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Her grandfather. 
[01:30:00]  And I swear I have this tape.  That's brutal.  I just can't find it.  Oh, I would love to hear that.  I've been, I've been searching for this tape off and on for years.  I can't find it.  Maybe, maybe I don't have it anymore, but I have so many cassettes.  I'm thinking it's just not one of these cassettes, but yeah, I, uh, I left the, the messages  on her grandfather's machine and her mom's, uh, machine.  That's, that's a true story.  Absolutely fucking true.  That is great fucking payback.  Yeah.  That, uh, that Lisa chick, the, the, she, she got in touch with me through Facebook and 
[01:30:30]  was like, she goes, I didn't even, uh, she goes, wow.  I, and it was recently like the past year or something.  She goes, Oh, I never made the connection that you were Anthony.  Oh really?  And I'm like, Jesus Christ.  I've been doing this for fucking years.  You bitch.  Right.  You never realized that?  I want to get a Facebook just to, you know, get in touch with some of the, some of the,  uh, peeps.  Yeah.  Some of the peeps from the past.  Especially the ones that were just fucking horrible to me.  Some of that is just depressing.  I'm going to start knocking on some doors. 
[01:31:00]  Knocking on doors.  Right.  You're going door to door.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Some of the girls that were so hot, you just go like, Oh God, no.  Oh fucking father time.  You prick.  You insufferable prick.  Yeah.  Not good.  Yeah.  Just eat them up.  Joe Rogan's here.  Why don't we take a break so we can get Rogan in.  Yes.  All right.  Uh, Joe Rogan is next with Ari and, uh, we got Chuck Liddell coming in and possibly, uh,  definitely Penn, but maybe Penn and Teller.  Very busy show.  And we continue after this.  This is theoretical physicist Michio Kaku. 
[01:31:30]  And even I can't explain how bad this show is.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We couldn't be happier.  Joe Rogan in studio.  Yes.  Finally.  Our pal.  It's been a while.  And Ari, of course.  To your right there, Joe.  What's going on, sir?  Ari.  Powerful Mr. Shavir.  Yes.  I was telling Joe, before he came in, I feel like I know what he's up to because of this 
[01:32:00]  new world we live in with the Twitter and the podcasting and everything else.  I follow, uh, the Joe.  Gotta follow the Joe Rogan.  Joe's got the best podcast out there.  He does get some good.  I like your, uh, I like your tweets where I look and go, wow, he is up really late, man.  And they're usually the most abstract ones when you've been up really late.  Because that's another thing.  People know what time you're going to bed.  It's not just what you're saying.  They know where you are, what you're doing at any given moment, which is kind of odd. 
[01:32:30]  So, because I was talking about this.  I get a lot of this shit.  If I tweet something at 1 a.m., I'll get like, go to bed.  You got a show to do.  What is it?  Wear stuff tomorrow?  You should get some sleep.  Like, you don't know that I slept from 1030 in the morning till eight at night.  I'm fine.  Don't worry about, you know, me getting enough sleep.  But, uh, yours where, you know, you're just, he's pontificating about some new mushroom.  And it's 3 a.m. California time.  You can tell when I get out of the tank, too.  Those are the really weird tweets. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, out of the tank, yeah?  Out of the tank, yeah.  Because usually I'm too high when I get in the tank to really tweet anything coherent.  Yeah.  So I get in and then level out and think things over and then get out with a bathrobe on  covered in salt from the Epsom tank.  Yeah.  And then I start surfing.  And that's the real weird tweet.  It starts checking out some shit.  Finding stories deep in the internet.  And then it's like, oh, that's a good one.  Yeah.  If you see something about somebody living in the Amazon, it's like 430 in the morning.  I'm high as fuck.  I'm a spider. 
[01:33:30]  Guarantee you.  No shit, man.  Hey, we should get the plug out right away.  Joe Rogan's going to be at the Gotham Comedy Club.  Oh, fuck it.  All right, then.  We don't need it.  We don't have to do any business.  The podcast has changed everything.  I don't have to do any more business anymore.  That's pretty cool.  Way different now.  It's really easy.  We got to ask Joe about the supermoon.  He knows that shit.  Yep.  We were trying to figure it out on our own right before you got here.  Well, you know, we know that the moon affects tides, and it's closer than it's ever been  before, or as close as it ever gets.  220,000 miles out, as opposed to, like, at its peak, I think it gets, like, 250-something.  How long ago was that? 
[01:34:00]  Like, what's the time difference?  It's a good question.  Millions of years?  Or, like, a couple years?  No, it goes in cycles.  You know, I mean, it's not...  It's...  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's just really close.  Let's just say a few thousand years ago, this happened.  The moon has an odd orbit.  You can't say that anymore.  He used to be able to talk shit like that and just pull a figure out of your ass or whatever.  Now people get online and they're, like, full of shit.  And we say something on the podcast, you know, because podcasts are just like the radio.  It's a conversation.  Yeah.  Sometimes you're not entirely accurate.  You're just trying to remember.  Like, what the fuck did that guy say?  That's exactly not what he said. 
[01:34:30]  Like, a hundred Twitters from Johnny Knownright.  You can't really paraphrase anymore.  It's like, no, here's the exact quote, dick.  It's good and it's bad, you know?  It's good that you can get that information right ahead, you know?  It's true.  You got any ridiculous haters that are just like...  I don't even bother them anymore.  You know, I don't even respond to haters.  I used to respond and, like, fuck you, go back and forth.  That's kind of what I was getting at is how you respond to them.  And it's gotten to the point where you just got to not even deal. 
[01:35:00]  I just completely ignore them.  I block them, ignore them.  It's pointless, you know?  I mean, if someone has a legitimate criticism or a point, I mean, and it's not, like, douchey, I totally respond.  Or if it's a joke, like, when people goof on me or something, it's a joke, that's fine.  I don't care about that.  I'll retweet a good one, yeah.  I'll retweet the good insults.  You can tell, sort of.  Even though it's in text, you can tell when someone's being a shithead and someone's just being funny.  Oh, you know the difference.  And then somebody, just the other day, somebody tweeted me or actually got through me on Facebook or something, 
[01:35:30]  because it wasn't tweet because I had blocked them.  And he goes, dude, what the fuck?  He goes, I was just making a joke and you blocked me?  And then he copied a picture of the tweet he gave me and I read it.  And there was no sense of sarcasm or anything.  He's like, I was just kidding.  And I was like, asshole, out of all the tweets I get, how am I supposed to pick yours out as the one that is just like, oh, I was being sarcastic?  When there wasn't a hint of sarcasm, it's like, of course I'm going to block you. 
[01:36:00]  I was like, fuck you.  I hate you.  Yeah.  That was pretty much it.  It's like, dude, you suck.  It was something about my fucking webcast sucks and this.  And it's like, all right, well then fuck you.  I'm blocking you.  How's that a joke?  It's like, dude, I was kidding.  Oh, really?  People are just happy to get your attention, though.  And a lot of times that's the only way they can get it.  If they say, Anthony, you fucking rock.  You ignore that.  Yeah, you don't get a hundred of those.  That's true.  I do go off on my drunken retweets and follows, though, sometimes. 
[01:36:30]  Like, it's Saturday, three in the morning, if I'm putting down a few, people just go, and retweet?  I'm like, all right.  And then once you do it once, it's just like, bam, I'm going bam, bam, bam, just hitting retweeting everybody.  You lose a hundred followers.  Oh, yeah.  Because they're just pissed off that fucking, that reading through my drivel.  You watch the numbers go down if you're tweeting too much.  Oh, I know.  I don't care about that.  Yeah, it's like the stock market.  And then you chill for a day or two, and the numbers go back up.  Yeah, that's all.  You've got to find that balance.  Hey, the superman, what is this supposed to do, though? 
[01:37:00]  Well, it's just, they're not exactly sure.  Some people think it's going to cause cataclysmic disasters.  Yeah.  It's close to the earth.  Yeah, what, earthquakes, tsunami, things like that?  There's another one in Chile.  No, there was another earthquake.  A small one in Chile just happened.  Yeah.  What's small these days?  Five, five, five, five, five point five.  Yeah, now five is like, ah, come on, man, shit.  Suck it up, losers.  Now that we've seen a nine.  Yeah.  Officially a 9.0, right?  Apparently there was a 9.2 in Alaska in the 60s, and the aftershocks hit San Francisco. 
[01:37:30]  You could feel it.  Really, yeah.  Wow.  And nothing was going on in Alaska, especially in the 60s.  9.2.  Yeah, 9.2.  Lasted for four minutes.  This one lasted for five minutes, which scares the fuck out of me.  Like, could you imagine that?  Like, because you think it's just going to rock you a little, and then, all right, stop.  After, you know what a long five minutes is when you're in an earthquake?  That isn't five minutes of fucking getting your dick sucked.  No.  You know, that's a hard five minutes, man.  That's like five minutes of Brock Lesnar on top of you.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  It's like, how long?  It's only been, what, a minute and a half?  You got three and a half for this to go?  I still got this.  Ah, shit.  What scares the fuck out of me is these nuclear reactors.  That's what scares the fuck out of me.  Yeah, yeah.  They didn't know, you can't just shut them off.  You can't shut them off.  That's the most ridiculous shit ever.  When the power goes out, you have eight hours of backup.  Once you-  So you basically have enough to get on a plane and get the fuck away from there.  That's about it.  Once you start it, that's how we thought this up, and it was going to be okay.  It's like, yeah, we start this reaction, and we could vary it to a certain extent, 
[01:38:30]  but we can't really shut it completely off.  Oh, and by the way, if it isn't cooled all the time, it's really going to fuck things  up.  The earth will die.  It melts down and eats a hole through the planet, and everyone dies.  Yeah.  It'll hit water eventually, right?  Oh, yeah.  Hopefully.  It'll hit lava.  It'll hit lava.  Death up.  Yeah.  The gas will kill every bird in the sky.  Yeah.  Instead of a few that have been dropping dead.  What do you make of this, Joe?  Joe tweets about this a lot. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  I try to be as objective as possible, but the last thing you want to do is be the guy that  says, there's no apocalypse while the earth is cracking between your two legs and spreading  them apart and Satan sticking a pitchfork up your asshole.  At a certain point in time, when enough fucking things happen, you've got to go, wow, is the  apocalypse just really slow?  Yeah.  Maybe it's a slow thing that takes some time.  You always think it's just going to be a quick action movie thing, but it's just, it's  a slow kind of, disasters get a little worse, the hurricanes get a little bigger. 
[01:39:30]  It's fun to watch, though.  Yeah.  Front row C.  Is it that?  And the other part of me goes, well, maybe is it just that we have more access to information,  so we're getting all these stories?  I think part of it is that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  But it seems like there's a lot more shit happening.  10,000 people died, right, in Japan?  At least.  That's a lot of people.  Oh, look at that.  They're saying, look at the evacuation area, 13 miles, 50 miles, no military.  No U.S. military without special clearance.  Oh, God.  Turns to U.S. for help. 
[01:40:00]  What do you want us to do, drop a bomb on the nuclear problem?  Yeah, just blow it up.  This is scary shit, man.  That's some, well, what they did at Chernobyl, you know, they didn't tell anybody around the  area, so they ended up with some problems there.  Some issues.  But they just wound up dumping concrete and sand and actually lead.  They took fucking lead, giant bars of lead, helicopter loads, and just dumped it on top  of this pile.  And it looks like that's what they're going to have to do with this shit. 
[01:40:30]  Chernobyl did that?  Yeah.  Wow.  But it's still eating through all that shit.  Oh, it's still underneath all that?  It's still glowing?  Well, it's got a half-life of like 20,000 years.  20,000 years, so it's just sitting there.  Well, we were talking, Ant and I were talking about this off the air.  There's an article that I was reading that was saying that some of the uranium that they  used was plutonium-urriched uranium that's two million times more radioactive.  Now, I don't know if this is true.  I just read it on one science site.  I have to go back and see if there's other ones.  But that's fucking terrifying. 
[01:41:00]  Two million times more radioactive than the normal shit?  Get the fuck out of here.  Why are they using that in Japan?  Apparently, it works really good.  It gives you a lot of energy.  I guess it does.  You would think, though, because they're pretty anti-nukes over there, you know, considering  they had a little issue back in World War II.  But, yeah, they have a lot of nuclear power, and this plant is just really fucked.  It seems like nuclear power is almost like a car that they figured out how to get really 
[01:41:30]  fast but never figured out how to stop.  How to stop it.  They weren't ready yet.  They weren't ready to put it on the road.  They're like, we've got an engine.  Let's just go.  Let's just go with this.  How are we going to stop this?  Just keep driving it around the track.  We don't know what to do.  We've got a rock attached to a rope.  We're going to throw it out the window.  And hopefully that stops the car.  It's like some Fred Flintstone shit.  You can turn it on, but you can't turn it off?  What the fuck, man?  It really is amazing.  That is kind of creepy.  They didn't figure that part out.  Well, not only that, it really hasn't really progressed. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, they haven't come up with any much better alternative.  Right.  There should be a way to cool it down.  Within a day?  Yeah, yeah.  About ever.  How about ever?  For the rest of time.  Yeah, forever.  Yeah.  Well, long past.  Think about 5,000 years ago was the dawn of civilization.  That was the first written language.  The first mathematics.  It was like 5,000, 6,000 years ago.  This shit will be radioactive way longer than that.  Way longer than we've even been an intelligent.  Way longer.  Leaving history. 
[01:42:30]  Fuck.  Exactly.  What is all that shit that they bury in Nevada when they have like...  Yeah.  They make deals so that they can fucking have casinos and hookers.  They let them fucking do tests and bury shit in the mountains.  Yeah, all those spent nuclear rods.  They gotta go somewhere.  And they load them up in a truck and in the middle of the night, they fucking drive them  to the Mojave Desert and Nevada and whatnot and bury them underground.  What a crazy idea.  And just hope the record of where that is is kept for some length of time. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, because if society falls apart, if we have some sort of a massive super volcano  eruption, half the population dies, no one's gonna know about that shit.  And the other half has to rebuild and then they rebuild.  They start digging there randomly.  Yeah, and it's like an 1800s style life that we have.  And then people just say, oh, let's start digging.  I think there might be something good here.  And they hit this shit.  Let's put our well here.  This is where I get water from.  It's getting very hot.  That's where it's digging. 
[01:43:30]  Is your skin burning off?  Is it just me?  Why are clumps of your hair falling out?  People are so goddamn ridiculous.  Yeah.  That's so ridiculous.  We reach back.  And like I said, we haven't really improved upon the basic gist of the reactor or the automobile  for the most part.  It's still an internal combustion engine.  It's better economy-wise and they look cool and everything.  But it's still a piston banging up and down in a cylinder.  Once we find something that works, we leave it until we run out of what that shit works 
[01:44:00]  on.  And then we have to come up with something.  That's why a viable alternative to fossil fuel, it ain't gonna happen until that last  drop of fuel is gone.  And then the next week, we'll have something great that'll work.  Because we've always done that through history.  Yeah.  We find shit.  We need to be forced into a corner.  We need to be forced.  We're lazy motherfuckers for the most part.  And until we turn on the water and it doesn't come out, then it's like, where's the water?  All right, we gotta work on this.  And then the next day, yeah, see, the water's back. 
[01:44:30]  The laziness is part of it.  But also, I mean, fossil fuel and the companies that own it and sell it, they have so much power.  Oh, yeah.  There's so much power as far as getting things pushed through and, you know, you can't fuck  Yeah, they're the guys that have, they can make politicians do things.  Yeah.  They mold the world.  Between them and Monsanto with their genetically modified food.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the Monsanto thing is the scariest thing about Monsanto is there was a lot of speculation  that they bought Blackwater. 
[01:45:00]  Jesus.  It can't be proved.  Wow, that's an interesting...  Because Blackwater was sold and it was sold to a third party and they know that Monsanto  was interested in it.  Now, why would Monsanto need a fucking, what amounts to mercenaries' security squad?  Because they're entering into other countries.  They're selling their genetically modified foods in other countries and trying to do the same  bulldog tactics that they use on American farmers.  If you don't know what it is, essentially, Monsanto comes up with genetically modified food  and a genetically modified seed that when farmers buy it, well, the shit gets in the air and  it cross-pollinates into other people's farms. 
[01:45:30]  Guys that didn't buy their seed, well, they come over and say, well, you have our shit and  we're going to sue you for it.  And then they sue these poor farmers and they fucked them over.  Sue the bees, motherfucker.  Because they have their strain of apricot.  I mean, look, there's something to be said for some genetically modified foods.  It's easier to grow.  More people, you know, can have food.  You know, less people starve.  You see corn on the cob these days, Joe.  It's fantastic.  It's giant, golden.  Every fucking little kernel is perfect.  You know what corn looked like back in the 60s and 50s?  It was awful. 
[01:46:00]  Maize.  Remember that shit the Indians used to have used to hang on our door?  All different kinds of colors and shit that you put on the door.  Homeless teeth.  Yeah.  It looks like rotting teeth.  Yeah, rotting teeth.  Fuck.  Now it's just this big and chicken breasts.  Holy fuck.  Well, one of the things about WikiLeaks was that WikiLeaks released cable showing how much influence  the genetically modified food people have in foreign countries and how the United States  is aiding them and the government is actually pushing these things through and even imposing  sanctions on countries that don't accept this stuff. 
[01:46:30]  Wow.  So if you hear about them now buying, you know, supposedly, allegedly buying Blackwater,  like they have their own fucking army and they have these evil seeds that they're selling  everywhere.  And is it just to sell their seeds?  To fucking run all the food.  They want to run everything.  That's a big business.  Yeah, it's huge.  I was just wondering what the end game is in their minds.  Controlling the world's food.  Controlling the world's food.  Controlling the world's food.  That's a big business.  They patent pigs.  They patent pig parts.  I mean, they literally patent everything they could possibly patent.  They want to be able to control the entire population of pigs and corn and everything. 
[01:47:00]  And what are they going to do after that?  Are they going to enslave everyone?  They just fucking run shit.  They're going to whip their dicks out and slap farmers in the face.  They're running things.  Wouldn't it be interesting if some of that genetically altered food has something in there that they  can, from some remote location, just shut off and your entire farm dies?  Like just some kind of a key.  That's the movie version of it.  Yeah.  Some kind of key where it's like, well, we need some famine in this area. 
[01:47:30]  Click.  Bam.  Instant famine.  That is, I mean, come on.  Why not?  Are you smoking pot?  It's possible.  No, it just, you get close to Joe and you start having that.  That would be the movie version of that idea thing.  It's a contact buzz.  Joe's giving us a contact buzz.  Joe, you tweeted a fucking video of how small we are in the universe.  Yeah.  I'm still forced out.  Yeah, I retweeted that fucking thing.  With the music?  It's the one with the fucking like dramatic.  Yeah, we put it on our Facebook.  We're giving you credit, I hope. 
[01:48:00]  Man, if that doesn't just make you want to jump out a window.  I didn't realize objects got that big in the universe.  Well, how about the one where you get to the largest sun and if you were flying over it in a jet, it would take thousands of years just to make one circle.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's the largest star.  You see that earth?  And it's so big.  You still can't comprehend it.  As it's going on, as this video is playing, you can't wrap your mind around size that big because it just, the earth becomes invisible.  Yeah, you can't wrap your head around it. 
[01:48:30]  You can't, and that's nothing compared to the entirety of it.  Yeah.  That's just the piece.  The really crazy thing that the quantum physicists have theorized lately is that inside every black hole is another universe.  They know that inside every galaxy is a supermassive black hole that's one half of one percent of the mass of the galaxy.  The bigger the galaxy, the bigger the black hole.  But now they believe that inside every one of those black holes is another universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with black holes, each with hundreds of billions of galaxies inside of them, each with black holes. 
[01:49:00]  It's infinite, infinite forever.  Infinite is very hard to kind of wrap your mind around and, you know, like you could just go off and not stop ever, ever.  It seems like there's a wall somewhere or you come back to the first point.  At some point, you can't quite imagine it.  There's got to be something weird.  They're playing it now on this little video.  And it's just, yeah.  And it just keeps going like, wow, that's big.  You think Jupiter is huge and then it's, then the sun pops out. 
[01:49:30]  Our sun's a little bitch.  The sun is a little bitch.  It gets owned by these fucking things.  The Sirius A just dwarfs the sun and then it just keeps going and going and going.  And now you can't even see Earth.  Trying to wrap your head around the size of the universe is like trying to pick up the ocean in your hands.  Yeah, it's just not even a piece of it.  You don't have it.  It's not going to happen.  So of course there's life out there.  Of course there is.  With infinite, there has to be.  There has to be.  With no end ever, there has to be.  Well, I think we have a very narrow idea of what life is. 
[01:50:00]  The idea is just biological, carbon-based life.  And that's where the only information is being traveled back and forth between participants.  I think it's really possible that there's some other forms of life that we can't even tune into.  Life easily could be like a radio.  There could be a full spectrum.  Right.  And we just can't tune into whatever their life is.  It could be.  There's theorized about light-based life.  Right, right.  So how would you communicate with some light-based life form that you don't even know existed if you passed right through it? 
[01:50:30]  Right.  Or it could be right here with us right now in another dimension, just like another radio station that you can't tune into.  You sit here, tune into 103.5, and 107's right there.  You just don't get it somehow or another.  Yeah, you don't get it.  It's right there.  Same radio.  You could get it if you just turned this knob, but you don't get it.  Jesus.  It's right here all around you all the time.  We're crazy music.  Yeah, crazy music.  It's all around you.  We were doing dick jokes 20 minutes ago.  Well, you know, when Christianity, when they had to convert pagans and they had to convert the Irish, is when they invented, St. Patrick actually, invented the idea of purgatory. 
[01:51:00]  And the reason why they had to invent the idea of purgatory, because the Irish, who were intoxicating, obsessed with being intoxicated, and they have a long history of taking mushrooms and believing in elves and fairies,  they had to convince people that the land of fae was purgatory.  They had to say, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's another thing.  It's a new thing.  And they had to, like, that's how they brought them into Christianity, by convincing them that there's this land around you filled with souls all the time. 
[01:51:30]  That's an ancient Irish belief.  It's, yeah, we were talking about religion sometime last week.  We had a good discussion about it.  And, yeah, it just gets to the point, though, where some people don't want to, they don't want to hear anything different than what they believe in, as far as the, you know, textbook Bible religion of Catholicism and Judaism.  They have theirs.  And you start going off and talking about the fact that, you know, this book was written a long time ago and not by God. 
[01:52:00]  It's by people.  You know how if you try to tell somebody something and they tell somebody else something, it gets all fucked up in the translation.  So, and they're like, no.  Well, that's in one language.  I mean, look, Ari studied the Torah for years.  You know, Ari was, like, seriously religious at one point in time.  Lived in Israel.  Lived in Israel for a couple years.  And that was an oral tradition for a long, long time.  Just hoping nobody fucked up the translation.  No one fucked it up as they went along history telling the story.  Well, not only that, the original Bible, the ancient Hebrew version of the Bible, trying to decipher it is like it's code. 
[01:52:30]  It's like it's just numbers and letters are the same thing.  Like the letter A is also the number one.  So words have numerical value.  Like love and God have the same numerical value.  And all that is lost when you translate it to Latin and Greek.  Yeah, yeah.  And also, they had an editor, right?  There were other stories.  Oh, sure.  Where are those stories?  The New Testament, for sure.  When you go with the New Testament, there was a lot of shit, a huge amount of words.  I want all the info, not just part of the info.  It doesn't matter.  It's all written by people. 
[01:53:00]  It's so obvious.  It's really obvious.  Really interesting.  A lot of scholars have been talking lately about one of the things about Moses and that they believe that Moses was doing psychedelic drugs.  Really?  Yeah.  You know the whole thing about Moses and the burning bush?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they believe the burning bush was the acacia tree.  And the acacia bush or tree or whatever the fuck it is is rich in dimethyltryptamine, a really potent psychedelic.  So the idea of this burning bush being God literally could have been God.  He might have, yeah.  Literally.  I mean, he might have had these crazy psychedelic experiences. 
[01:53:30]  That's what a lot of people believe, that all of these ancient religious stories, the roots of them are all in someone finding something that makes you trip.  Well, there were plenty of narcotics just growing around.  I mean.  Still are, yeah.  Yeah, there still are.  No laws against them back then.  Yeah.  You just chew on a leaf and all of a sudden you have this vision.  You write it down and people aren't just going to go, ah, that guy was fucked up.  You go, really?  You did?  You saw God?  Put it in this book.  Well, they used to try to hide them from their enemies.  You know, the book.  Hide the psychedelics?  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Well, the book, The Sacred Mushroom in the Cross, is by a guy that was one of the scholars who was the,  one of the guys, the main guys of deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls, this dude named John Marco Allegro.  And he was the only one in the entire Dead Sea Scrolls deciphering committee that was an agnostic.  He started out, he was an ordained minister.  But as he was studying theology, he's like, well, this is all horseshit.  So he starts studying it.  And he got into this Dead Sea Scrolls, which is a thousand years older than the oldest version of the Bible.  It's old as fuck.  Written on animal skins.  Right.  In Aramaic.  Okay? 
[01:54:30]  He deciphers this shit for 14 years and decides that the entire Christian religion is a massive misunderstanding.  What it's really about is the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults.  And fertility rituals and the whole, the whole religion was based on these stories were meant to hide all the, the, the knowledge that they learned from taking mushrooms.  Holy shit.  That, but, you know.  Makes sense.  It makes a lot more sense.  They create metaphors intentionally to try to hide it?  Mm-hmm.  Huh.  He traces back the ancient word, uh, Christ, to, uh, an ancient Sumerian word that means a mushroom covered in God's semen. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Try selling that to the, try selling that to the Catholic Church.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Good luck changing everybody's mind there.  Yeah.  But you bring this up, you, you piss off a lot of people.  Yeah, but do you know, you know, they, they piss themselves off.  You're being silly.  Why would you believe that other, people are full of shit and that story sucks.  It's that simple.  If it came out today, if the Bible came out today and just the story of Adam and Eve, you'd go, what the fuck are you talking about? 
[01:55:30]  So they made kids and their kids just started fucking each other?  Like, what are you talking about?  They were the only two people and their kids fucked each other or they fucked their kids and make more kids?  Yeah.  Like, what are you talking about?  That doesn't, and then what happens?  Noah comes along and then we start all over again.  Noah fucks his kids because he's the only guy left.  So that's only 6,000 years ago that this has happened.  That's a lot of kid fucking going on.  Well, Disney, the scary thing is 50% of the population in this country in a recent Gallup poll believes that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old.  It's up to 50%.  That's crazy shit. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, how do you just deny the science that is behind the fact that this Earth is a lot older than that?  It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Confirmation bias.  You just go on enough websites and say that the science is bullshit.  You can find 100 dudes on YouTube that would tell you that evolution is a myth and that there's science behind it not being real.  You can find hundreds of guys.  And if you just only read their stuff and listen to their stuff, you'll start believing it.  When I see those paintings that they have in books of Jesus with a dinosaur, they show like Jesus lying peacefully with a velociraptor. 
[01:56:30]  There's an ancient fresco in France with Adam and Eve surrounded by giant mushrooms.  Really?  Yeah, and it's ancient.  It's like 1,000 years old.  And there's a ton of those.  There's a bunch of ancient religious artwork that deals with mushrooms.  A lot of it.  Let's go to the phones because Tom, very upset.  Tom in St. Louis.  Tom.  Tom in St. Louis. 
[01:57:00]  I'd be upset if I lived in St. Louis, too.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's going on, buddy?  We got you.  Go.  Hey, Joe, I'm a big fan of you, but your information on Monsanto is way off.  What's off about it?  Well, you're spewing stuff that you've probably read on the Internet or stuff like that.  I've watched a bunch of documentaries, too.  I watched the Monsanto documentary, Food, Inc.  Well, tell me what I'm wrong about.  By the way, this is Tom Monsanto calling.  Probably King Corn as well, I'm guessing.  Right.  What are we wrong about? 
[01:57:30]  Well, the one thing you said, first of all, you talked about how they spread the genetics  across the country.  No, no, no.  That's not what I said.  I said farmers that are next to people that have genetically modified food that gets cross-pollination.  And those farmers have been sued.  That's a fact.  It actually happened for one person.  It happened for a guy by the name of Percy Schmeiser out of Canada.  He got sued over having canola.  There's only one guy?  Yeah, that was his claim is that Monsanto's genetics wound up in his field because of 
[01:58:00]  the birds.  That was that man's claim.  Man, are you sure this is only one person?  I don't have a computer in front of me, so I can look this up.  But this is the only person they've ever had a lawsuit with?  Is this one guy?  But it's definitely not the only person they've ever had a lawsuit with.  But Percy Schmeiser is the main guy behind it who, and I believe it's in Food Inc.  They bring him in and possibly King Corn as well, but I can't say for sure on that.  All right, well, what's your beef? 
[01:58:30]  What is your issue?  You think Monsanto's good?  I think they do a great deal.  I think they do some wonderful things.  Do you work for them?  Yeah, I do.  You do?  Yeah, you do.  Get the fuck out of here, you creep.  You're a genetically modified creep.  He's a little biased, I think.  You're eating some fucking bad potatoes that are making dick fall off in a hundred years.  There's going to be no dicks a hundred years from now.  Humans will have no penises.  By the way, I loved Journey Through Inner Space.  Monsanto put it on at Disney.  It was fantastic years ago. 
[01:59:00]  Remember, you would shrink and...  What do you do for them, dude?  Oh, Monsanto used to fucking sponsor this big thing.  Brought to you by Monsanto.  Voyage Through Inner Space.  Oh, that weird thing where you would watch the human body, like the bloodstream.  And you'd shrink.  Yeah.  You'd go in the little car, and you'd go in, and it's like, whoa...  And you'd get to go through the human body.  And a microscope, and they'd show us a mechanical eye.  Is he still on the line?  Yeah, Tom, uh...  If the company fires you, are you willing to spill the beans on the O.P. and Anthony show  about how things really go down?  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Can we count on you?  In accounting?  Because you know there's some evil shit.  When you're trying to patent pigs, you're an evil fucking company, pal.  Well, I don't know if I totally agree with that, because, I mean, first of all,  they don't own their pig line anymore.  Listen, fella, you're trying to patent pigs, okay?  That's some creepy god shit.  You can't patent nature.  Wait a minute, Joe.  If you do the research to come up with the technology...  You just said a bunch of nonsense.  If you do the research for the technology, for instance, from behind the corn, behind 
[02:00:00]  the pig development, if you do the research to come up with the genetics that make the  corn better, shouldn't you be able to take advantage of that research?  You don't think that there should be a line that you can't cross, or you can't patent  life?  Apricots, right?  You really think that it's okay to patent life because you guys have done the research?  That's horse shit, pal.  Well, if you want to do something like that, you should be able to profit from it, and  it should benefit mankind, but no, you can't fucking own it.  All right?  You can't own life.  You can't sue people for having your life. 
[02:00:30]  You don't own life.  What is the reason behind your thinking there?  Well, because I don't want creepy cunt companies owning the world like that.  It seems kind of fucked up, don't you think?  Were there companies, multinational conglomerates that own life?  But they do the research behind the genetics.  I mean, it's not like I, it's not, it's not me thinking.  You don't see any problem with that?  Do you have a problem with them owning Blackwater?  What if that's true? 
[02:01:00]  Is that true?  Can you tell us?  You work for the company.  That was the first time I'd ever heard that when you said that.  It's online, fella.  If you're going to be the guy that's running around Johnny Save-A-Ho  defending Captain Monsanto.  I haven't seen anybody in black coats and black sunglasses.  You might want to look in your back window right now  because they're probably monitoring you because of this call.  Someone's got crosshairs on the back of his head right now  waiting for him to say one word.  Right now you're being a good soldier, sir.  What do you do there for Monsanto?  I work in finance. 
[02:01:30]  Finance.  Bean counter.  She's a genetically modified bean counter.  Yeah, and you shut down farmers, go down and steal all their fucking money.  One ear of corn that's mutant Frankenstein corn.  All right, buddy.  It was good talking to you, brother.  That's it.  Take care, Joe.  The second he hangs up, there's one crack of a gunshot  and the back of his head explodes.  Bammo.  Hey, someone tweeted the Adam and Eve mushroom fresco. 
[02:02:00]  Isn't that strange?  And that's from 1291 A.D.  I'll retweet this thing.  That's creepy.  That looks like fucking mushrooms to me.  Oh, it is mushrooms.  There's a lot of ancient religious artwork that has to do with mushrooms.  Here's another one from the same tweet.  You see that red and the white?  That's the Amanita muscaria mushroom.  That's also the colors of Santa Claus.  And so they knew about that in the 1200s?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we've lost a lot of that information because people don't talk about it now.  Okay, 1192 A.D.  And then you've got this one. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, shit.  I just lost it.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, whatever.  I'll find it again.  Yeah.  There's a lot of that.  There's a lot of that.  Wow.  I learned something new today.  I didn't know.  There's a guy named Jack Herrer that was this big hemp activist that was writing a book  about it before he died.  But his book was all about ancient religious artwork and how much of it had to do with  psychedelic drugs.  And what?  They just bury this stuff?  You don't really see it anymore.  You do see some of it is also even in ancient Catholic stuff.  Like if you see some of their artwork.  Like you see the pine cone all the time in ancient Catholicism and Christianity. 
[02:03:00]  The pine cone represents the pineal gland.  And that represents the gland that produces dimethyltryptamine and psychedelic drugs.  And there's a lot of the doorways that are shaped like mushrooms.  And that's supposed to be symbolic.  Jesus.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  It makes sense.  But the idea behind the sacred mushroom and the cross was that all these religious  people hid all this information.  And that it also was hidden by the bishops and by the higher echelons of the church would 
[02:03:30]  hide it from the peasants because they didn't want them becoming enlightened.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  The original halos, the original halo wasn't a circle like on the top of your head like  a hula hoop.  It was a mushroom cap.  Like the behind your head was a mushroom cap.  I remember seeing some of those.  Literally with the spines like a mushroom.  That was because you were supposed to be holy.  You were fucked up on shrooms and you saw some things.  I'm so fucked up.  You were connected.  Holy shit.  You were connected to God.  Everything I know is wrong. 
[02:04:00]  Here's one from the 22th century BC.  Yeah.  There's so much of it.  There's a lot of it.  I've never seen this shit before, Joe.  And the artists were aware of it.  Whoever was painting these things were aware of it.  Obviously.  Well, it was a much more commonly known thing.  You know, especially in Europe.  I mean, consuming mushrooms goes back.  There's a long, long history of that.  God, they're fun.  Yeah.  I mean, if you think about people that lived thousands of years ago with no knowledge of science and all of a sudden they, you know, they're starving and they stumble across these mushrooms.  They eat them. 
[02:04:30]  They trip their fucking balls off.  And then they have these incredible experiences and rethink society.  And then everybody comes closer together and the better sense of being connected.  You go, we got to keep this from other people.  And then that's where it all goes astray.  I just retweeted that OP radio.  If you want to see the frescoes that Joe turned us all on to.  Joe turns us on to some great shit.  Because they wouldn't know about why they're feeling that way.  Yeah.  Like, they wouldn't know the science behind it.  They would just know the spirituality behind why they feel that way. 
[02:05:00]  Honestly, even to this day, the science is very screwy.  It's like, what is really happening with mushrooms?  So it might be some type of divine connection.  What it might be is a life form from another planet that only communicates with you by eating it.  Holy shit.  The way you describe...  I'll leave little notes for you.  Joe can just fuck with you.  But why aren't you writing movies?  I don't want to write movies.  Between doing a podcast and doing all the shit that I do...  Joe, tell me that wouldn't be a great plot for a movie, right? 
[02:05:30]  Well, there's a guy named Terrence McKenna who theorized on it.  That he believed that mushroom...  You know, there's a theory of pansperia.  I think that's how you say it.  Where life came from asteroids.  And, you know, there was like that controversial NASA scientist recently said that they found some, you know, evidence of...  Yeah, fossilized...  Fossilized life.  Life on it.  Which is disputed.  But a lot of people believe that.  I mean, we talked about that with Michio Kaku.  Last time I was on the air.  The idea of life coming from another planet.  We hung up on him right before you...  I heard.  I was listening.  I was laughing at my ass.  I thought it was great. 
[02:06:00]  Who knew that the next day we would need him?  I love when Dr. Steve gets mad at him.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Dr. Steve just texted me.  What'd he say?  Because he's listening.  He goes,  The difference between Joe Rogan and Jesse Ventura is Joe Rogan's conspiracies are cool.  The government is out there.  Don't deny it.  You deny it was a Navy SEAL?  Then shut your mouth.  That thing with Will Jimmy and him was fucking brilliant.  Those are the best moments, man.  That thing won't go away. 
[02:06:30]  It won't go away.  It should be a riffraff from Rocky Horror Hairdue.  He was exposed for being a knucklehead.  Yeah.  He was exposed for being a,  Do you deny that the government has JFK and the Warren Commission?  And we don't have...  The missile hit the Pentagon?  We don't have it on video,  but the reason he got up and left was he was in over his head.  Yes.  He couldn't argue anymore his point.  Well, Jimmy attacked him.  But he had nothing to back it up.  What are your facts?  Anything?  Huh?  Do you have any facts?  Are you just like going off?  Yeah, he just goes off. 
[02:07:00]  From an intelligence standpoint,  he got his ass kicked and he knew it  and the only thing he could think of  was to just get himself out of the situation.  He's used to going on...  Unfortunately, we don't have that on video.  He's used to going on these radio shows and TV shows  where they don't challenge him.  They allow him to be the eccentric.  Right, right, right.  You know, comes in with these controversial ideas.  Yeah, like a hard-hitting show for him  is going on The View.  Yeah, sure.  And Sherry Shepard goes,  That didn't happen.  No, you're wrong.  And like, that's the controversy.  Well, if you want to believe it.  She also thinks the earth is flat.  Yes.  Let's not forget.  I'm sure.  She thinks Christianity predates everything. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, we love playing that audio every once in a while.  I want to ask Joe one thing.  What set you down this road  of collecting all this knowledge  and thinking differently?  Well, you know, just being a comic.  Being a comic, having all day.  But I mean, way before a comic,  when you were growing up,  what got you?  Were you like,  You know what?  I got to do my own research now.  When I was five years old,  my father beat the fuck out of my mother in front of me.  And for no reason.  My mother came home with hamburger  and my dad was mad that that's what she got for dinner. 
[02:08:00]  So he slapped her in the head  and knocked her down and just screaming.  And yet my father was a very bad person.  And he's a very violent guy.  And I'll never forget that.  Being five years old saying,  Even my own dad is a piece of shit.  Oh, fuck.  Like, wow.  At five?  At five.  Oh, you're supposed to realize that later.  Yeah.  Damn, man.  Wow.  You're supposed to just go,  Oh, hamburger sucks, huh?  That started to end.  I guess hamburger gets your ass beat.  Don't put your own hamburger for dad.  Learning something. 
[02:08:30]  I think, you know, that was it.  And then moving around a lot.  I lived in San Francisco from the time I was seven  till I was 11.  Then Florida from 11 to 13.  Boston from 13 to 24.  There was a lot of moving.  So there was a lot of being forced to be,  you know, to come up with your own opinions  instead of just adopting the opinion of a group  that you're hanging around with.  That's the fucking, like,  that's very similar to my lifestyle.  Yeah.  Oh, God, I have the spaghetti hitting the wall story.  Dad wasn't into throwing things except fists.  Oh, really?  Is he still around?  I don't know.  I don't talk to him.  I haven't talked to him since I was seven. 
[02:09:00]  He's got my name, too.  His name's Joe Rogan.  Really?  Yeah.  That's his punishment.  So what, your mom?  My mom remarried a great guy.  But your mom got you out of the situation, obviously.  Yeah, that's why we moved to San Francisco.  It's one of the reasons.  Wow.  Because I wanted to be with him.  And, you know, this is a lot of dangerous shit.  Yeah.  He was a cop.  And he was a crazy guy.  Oh, really?  A little high-strung?  I don't remember much of my childhood,  but I remember a lot of beatings.  I didn't take any,  but I saw him beat the fuck out of my cousin.  Saw him beat the fuck out of my mom a couple of times. 
[02:09:30]  Really?  Yeah, he was crazy.  Never hit you, though?  No, no.  He loved me.  I wonder why.  Because I was nice.  I was a little boy.  I was a little five-year-old.  I used to get smashed with the belt, though.  I used to get the belt.  He wasn't into hitting me.  He probably would have eventually kicked my ass.  Wait, so you could fight back a little bit.  When I started talking shit and, you know...  Oh, yeah, then you had to...  Learned how to wrestle.  Coming up right around the house.  Got to keep this kid down.  The young lion has to be put in his place.  Yeah, I don't know.  Who knows?  I mean, maybe he would have never,  but he liked to beat the shit out of my mom.  Wow.  So I think at an early age, 
[02:10:00]  I had to start questioning things.  I was terrified of, you know,  all the possibilities.  So that's probably what started it.  And then when I was a comic,  you know, you have all this time in the day,  you know, especially when, you know,  you're just...  All you're doing is just driving to gigs at night,  so you have literally 20 hours in the day  to do whatever the fuck you want.  When I was probably 22 or 23,  a buddy of mine gave me this book,  this David Lifton book called Best Evidence,  and it was all about the JFK assassination.  And David Lifton was a...  He was an accountant, 
[02:10:30]  and he was assigned to do something  with the Warren Commission.  And as he was writing a piece  about this Warren Commission report,  he literally researched the entire book  and found all these inconsistencies  and all these places  where it contradicted itself  and realized that this was just a book  that was sort of calculated  to achieve a goal  instead of, you know,  designed to sort of really get  an accurate description of the events.  So I started reading this,  and I started getting into  all kinds of fucked up things,  and it became a huge problem.  I remember the day I got the book,  I fucking bombed that night on stage 
[02:11:00]  because I read the book during the day.  I was in Philadelphia.  I was working for Andy Scarpatti  and the comedy cabaret.  And, you know,  I'm in my fucking hotel all day  reading this terrifying book  about how the government  was taken over in a coup by the CIA.  And he was shocked Kennedy.  Bummed out and freaked.  Bummed out and ate dick on stage  and then I had to come back.  That was like Friday.  I had to come back  and redeem myself Saturday.  Saturday I just beat off  and, you know, watched cartoons.  Got my mojo back. 
[02:11:30]  Bring yourself down a little bit.  Yeah, man.  You can fucking, you know,  that's the problem with guys like  Alex Jones will tell you  about the New World Order.  You hang around with those guys  and you're convinced  that the fucking,  the sky's falling.  Yeah.  We were talking about this  before the show.  Like, is the apocalypse here?  Is it just moving really slow?  Yeah, yeah.  That's, because you see shit happening.  And then you start thinking, though,  like, all right.  Nothing's happening to us.  Just pick, like, yeah.  Yeah, it's like,  this is kind of cool.  Yeah, it's, but I mean,  I'm going to turn on the TV  and just fuck around  and watch dumb shows 
[02:12:00]  and shit like that.  You're better off.  You're better off.  It's still there, you know?  You can find suffering  everywhere in the world  if you look every day of the week  and decide to suffer constantly.  All you have to do  is just tune into the Africa channel.  Just whatever you want,  just watch everything about Africa  and you'll see people.  Oh, okay.  I don't think that's the same time.  Oh.  You turn off that news, though.  It's a nice place.  Yeah, it's not bad.  It's pretty peaceful out there.  I don't watch the news.  You don't watch the news at all?  At all.  I don't bother with it at all.  People are like,  oh, aren't you going to die  of radiation in California?  I'm like, maybe.  Well, the radiation's hitting.  Maybe.  They'll all die. 
[02:12:30]  What do you want me to do?  Radiation's hitting California today?  Is it?  Yeah, a little bit.  Is that the truth?  Well, get your pills.  A little bit, a little bit.  If I'm less fertile,  it's only good for me.  You know, California, though,  we have built up a resistance  from using cell phones all the time  that I think we're going to be okay.  It's going to be fine, yeah.  It's slowly built up resistance.  It's like vaccines.  It's like a vaccine for radiation.  Cell phone and Wi-Fi.  It's everywhere.  You're going to be fine.  Our Wi-Fi will kill that radiation.  Cheap-ass fucking radiation.  I know.  When you sit there sometimes  and think how much shit  is going through you 
[02:13:00]  when you're just sitting here.  Like in the 1800s, I guess,  you know, and before,  they just had whatever cosmic shit  was floating around,  natural stuff.  Uh-huh.  Full ozone.  Yeah, yeah.  Shit like that.  Zero holes in it.  Now, you know,  you're like, all right,  now we got radio.  And all those radio signals,  it is radiation.  It's just fucking radiation.  We're wearing radiation right now.  And that's going through you.  Yeah.  Right on our head.  How do we know this is?  We put headphones on  that fucking have magnets 
[02:13:30]  that are being fucking powered.  Yeah, how the fuck do we know  this is okay?  Changing our brains.  I bet it is.  I bet it's rewiring our brains.  It's got to be.  And at any given,  just think of all the different frequencies  that are being used and stuff.  All those signals  just fucking permeating you.  Wi-Fi, cordless phone.  Yeah, there's just more being added.  GSM signal, CDMA, all combining.  Everything just...  And what's that doing?  We're not going to get  the tumors in our head anymore  because we don't use  our cell phones for phone calls.  Yeah, you're going to get  like finger tumors  from texting and tweeting. 
[02:14:00]  Extra joints.  We should take a break.  We got Joe Rogan in studio  with Ari.  And does this mean anything?  What?  Because this might be my tease.  Bath salts?  Oh, yeah.  You know what that is?  After the break?  Yeah.  Well, it's not worth bringing up.  Yeah, no, it is.  And Ari's shit-covered,  deformed asshole?  Oh, yeah.  We can talk about that.  That's from the podcast?  I missed that episode?  For the folks,  Jewclam.  Google Jewclam.  Jewclam uncensored.  Yeah, Jewclam uncensored.  What is that?  You got it online?  Oh, yeah.  His asshole's online. 
[02:14:30]  I can't wait.  All right.  A cheeseburger.  Is Liddell here?  Yeah.  Is he here?  Beautiful.  Where the fuck is he?  He's in the office.  Oh, I'm sorry, Chuck.  I didn't even see it.  He's beating the fuck out of a roll.  You're going to speak the shit out of somebody now.  You know,  they wouldn't let him  in the St. Patrick's Day parade  with his fucking green mohawk.  They made him wear a hat  to cover his green mohawk.  Why?  Because the green mohawks  against the rules.  They have no hair dye rule.  You can't dye your hair.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  Reed Harris from the fucking WEC  told me yesterday.  Why couldn't you tell you?  What the fuck is wrong with people?  That's silly. 
[02:15:00]  Regulations!  Green, for the St. Patrick's Day.  But everyone watching the parade  is shit-faced.  Almost getting hit by cars,  getting in fights,  puking all over the place.  You can't dye your hair, though.  You can't hulk out.  That's so stupid.  Hulk out.  Oh, there it is.  All right.  Oh, God.  All right.  They're going to watch me.  That's fine.  Get ready.  We'll check it out after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  I hear the music.  It gets into you.  I hear the music.  Millions of watts.  All of this low-level sound,  well, it gets into you.  And so I said, 
[02:15:30]  Well, you know what?  I hear the music.  Bring back the music.  All of this music.  Well, you know what?  I hear the music.  And so I said to him,  I said,  Bring back the music.  And he said,  Excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Fucking don't put fucking words in my mouth.  And so I said to him,  I said,  Wait a minute.  I hear the music.  Wait a minute.  I hear millions of watts.  And so I said to him, 
[02:16:00]  I said,  You all talk a big thing.  You only talk it.  You don't walk it.  And he said,  Excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth  Don't put fucking words in my mouth  Billions of watts going up into the ionosphere  You hear it through the front of your skull  I hear billions of watts  You hear it through the front of your skull  This is Randy the Natural Couture  This is Tito Ortiz  This is Chuck the Iceman Liddell  This is Dana White from the Ultimate Fighting Championship 
[02:16:30]  And you're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show  There we go  We're back  Just did 20 minutes for everybody  For people in studio  We got Joe Rogan, we got Ari  And now we got Chuck Liddell  The Iceman  He was confirming the story  They didn't let you walk through St. Patrick's Day Parade with your green hair 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, they gave me a great green beret  Knitted beret  Knitted beret, it looked great  Because that looks normal  Yeah, that was much better than having it  I've been sitting there for two hours waiting to get on  And walk in the parade  And at the last minute I'm walking out  And the guy's grabbing me  You can't walk in the parade  You can't walk like that  Why?  I don't know  Because I got a mohawk and it was green  I don't know  That's one of the two  I don't know  Green mohawk  Was it Catholic enough or something?  I don't know  So stupid  That's what they told me  Yeah, apparently there's a no hair dye rule 
[02:17:30]  Ridiculous  I never knew that  Yeah, I had no idea  No one told me  If I was asked  I would have said  Yeah, there's plenty of people  With their hair dyed  Marching in there  But I guess not  More government  Intruding into the man's life  What happened with the whole gay thing  With the parade?  What was the gay thing?  It used to be a big issue  Is that the gays always wanted to march  In the St. Paddy's Day parade  Really?  And every year  It was a giant issue  Like, no  We're not letting  If you're gay  And you want to be in the parade  You've got to be in as  You know 
[02:18:00]  Part of this thing  And just be a gay guy  Marching with this group  But they wanted like  The gay group  To march  And it was always a big thing  But now  That just kind of went away  I think the gays just gave up  Just gave up on it  Nobody realized how ridiculous it is  Yeah, yeah  Going as a gay contingent  Yeah  The whole point is  St. Patrick's Day  It's not whether or not  You fuck guys  Yeah  It didn't make any sense  So I guess they gave up  Fuck them  So St. Patrick  The church just doesn't want you  Yeah, yeah  It really is  Don't want you guys 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, regardless of  You know, you could say  What God's intent is  With the gay guys  The church doesn't like you  You could really just say that  I don't know what God's opinion  On gay guys are  But the church hates you  It pretty much does  Not very open-minded  When it comes to that  It's funny how many  Fucking gay people  There are in the church though  I know  That's what's really weird  You would figure that  They would make it  Kind of easier on gays  In my opinion  If you want to take  A vow of celibacy  There's got to be 
[02:19:00]  At least some confusion  As to your sexuality  Yeah  If you're saying  I think I could go  My entire life  With no pussy  Eh  Eh  I think you're denying  What you want  And you know  You're in that middle ground  Of I don't want pussy  But I better not  Jump on the cock  Let me  Let me  Go  Become a clergy  Controversial  Priest  Who's that  Controversial priest  Who's really  Really popular in Miami  Really  Some charismatic  Young priest 
[02:19:30]  They caught him  With a woman  And he's in a lot  Of trouble  Because of that  So he had a  He left the catholic church  Yeah  They frowned upon that  Wow  Yeah  They should keep that guy  And he  You know  He gave a speech  About him  He was like  Look they're all gay  He's like  The priests are all gay  He's a huge contingency  Of gay people  Gay people and kid fuckers  That's what it is  I mean that's really  What it is  It's ridiculous  That you know  It's even controversial  To say that  I know  Yeah  Because you say that  And you think  Oh am I going to get  But come on  Look through history  Could you imagine  If NASCAR drivers  Fucked as many kids  As priests did 
[02:20:00]  They would shut down  NASCAR  They sure wouldn't be  Riding anymore  They wouldn't just  Move them to another state  You're going to have to  Race in West Virginia now  Fucking  The cars  All you'd see  Is a paint job on them  There wouldn't be one  Sponsor sticker  On anything  Anything  That's amazing though  Isn't it  Yeah  Just a bunch of  Pink cars  Going around in circles  They can just keep doing it  Wow  Look at that  They got a Geiger counter  On some kid's head  In Japan  They had some kid  At the airport  And the guy  With a big glove on  Oh with that shower head  Thing they've been 
[02:20:30]  Fucking scanning people with  They scanned his little head  His little head  To see if he's radioactive  Well they're saying  They can't really tell  If you've ingested  Anything radioactive  By putting that  Fucking detector  By your head  And by your body  They can tell  If you've been  In radioactive surroundings  But they can't tell  How much you've ingested  How long you've been  In the area  I was talking before  Shep Smith  Yeah Shep Smith  On Fox News  He's going to glow in the dark  The guy has been there  For  Since it happened 
[02:21:00]  He's constantly  Right near the reactor  Even Anderson Cooper  Isn't going to Japan  No  No  No he was there  Was he  He goes everywhere  Dangerous  No they had a video  I think he came back  They had a video of him  Going should I leave  Should I get out of here  Should I get out of here  Because new info  Was coming in  And he just broke character  Like should I be here  What happened to that  Chick in Egypt  That got beat up  And sexually assaulted  Did they release the story  Of what exactly happened  You won't see her no more  I don't know 
[02:21:30]  She just went away  She got pinched really hard  Was one of the descriptions  Pinching her vagina  I guess  I think her nipples  I think they were doing  Things to her nipples  I think they tweaked the nipples  Really hard  They were biting her tits  Really  Oh yeah  Yeah  They said it went on  For like a half an hour  I know  Yeah  Jesus Christ  That means a few guys  And they're a sick party  That hears shit like that  And goes like  Wow  Like every  You had the folks  Listening at home  You had a scared 
[02:22:00]  In his face  There was a bit  Of nostalgia  In his eyes  You might want to  Explain a little bit  A little further  I would never  Like make light  Of the horror  That this woman  Went through  And that other  Women go through  When they're being  Sexually assaulted  But when you just  Read the story  And take the humanity  Out of the mix  I don't know  Who this person is  I just know  It's female A  And male  B through Z  You know 
[02:22:30]  Do anything  It's just this  Twisted kind of  Perverse sick  And there's something  Titillating about it  You want to bring it down  To caveman shit  Yeah yeah  Caveman style  Where there's no  Fucking laws or anything  Doesn't matter  But it's not caveman shit  Because it's a suppression shit  You're not supposed  To be doing this shit  It's not like a nature shit  No it is  You're not supposed  To be doing it  It's very bad  It's an evil thing  Nature's a one on one  I go fuck you  Shoot a load in you  Make a baby  That's natural  But did we decide  It's nature  You know what I mean  Or is it nature shit  Where you're supposed  To just fucking  Be an animal like that 
[02:23:00]  Well you know  There's a lot of that  Left over  Did we decide  That it's not  Not okay  The real reality  Of human bodies  Is that we have  The same genetics  That they had  Back when they were  Running from saber tooth tigers  And fucking stabbing  Woolly mammoths  With sticks  But we like to think  Because we've got  More knowledge  Because we have  Smartphones  I mean we're  Fighting it  We still have  Fighting those monkey instincts  We call it the perv switch  Yeah it's in there  And some guys lose  The fucking battle  With the perv switch  Well nature and the perv switch  Are two totally different things  A lot of the perv switch  Comes from suppression  Yeah 
[02:23:30]  You know a lot of it  Comes from this  Sort of rebounding  It's like catholic school girls  When I was in high school  Oh my god  Those freaks  They fucked like crazy  The craziest chick  I ever dated  Was when I was in high school  Was a catholic school girl  This chick fucked  Everybody who asked  Everybody who tried  To fuck her  Got to fuck her  If you dragged a dick  On the ground across her  It would be like a kitten  With a ball of yarn  She would just dive on it  She was a fucking whore  By the time we were like 20  She'd already had  Three abortions  Wow  Oh this bitch 
[02:24:00]  Fucked everybody  This catholic girl  And she couldn't help it  She couldn't help herself  She had a look in her eyes  Like she was hypnotized  And it was the suppression  She fucked her  I was dating her  And she fucked one of my friends  I came home  It was like 4 o'clock in the morning  They were parked  In front of my house  And my buddy was fingering her  In the car  And I slammed my hand  On the hood of the car  I go  What the fuck  And then I got in my car  And I drove off  Fingering her in the front seat  This bitch was crazy  And it was all catholic school  Just fucking  Wonked her head  Her whole family was 
[02:24:30]  Everything  Every time  If somebody sneezed  There was fucking  Everybody made the crucifix sign  You know  A car honked its horn  Oh Jesus  Everybody was  Everything was  Crucifix  I knew a family like that  And it was a lot of girls  Sisters  And all raised  Like strict catholic family  Where when we wanted  To go to the movies  We couldn't just  Pull up to the house  We had to come in the house  We couldn't pick the girl up  Just by beeping the horn  And stuff  Had to come into the house  It's the mother and father there  And then they asked  What movie were we seeing  And they would look  In the catholic digest 
[02:25:00]  To see if the movie  Was rated by the catholic digest  And some of them  Were rated condemned  Like the movie's  Fucking condemned  Like the exorcism  Yeah something like that  Would be just condemned  So we'd have to say  We were going to see a movie  That was rated within  You know  The parameters  That they wanted  And the fucked up thing is  We never went to the movies  We'd go park behind  Like Leahy Jr. High  And just fuck in the car  And get blow  And then come home  And like  We'd have to get a synopsis 
[02:25:30]  Of the movie  And yeah it was great  And time it out right  And get home  But like you said  Just the most horrid  They would send us up  And the parents were oblivious  They thought you know  Because they were raising them  Like this  That they were perfect  Me and a bunch of my friends  Would go out with these sisters  Because they were all sisters  Take a station wagon  Upstate New York  To a cabin  That the parents owned  And the parents wanted  An equal number  Of guys to girls  They said no  You can't go  Unless there's another guy  Which was the oddest thing 
[02:26:00]  It's like why would you  That doesn't make sense  You're just gearing up  For a good fuck fest  With your daughter  And it was  We would go up there  And they would be like  You know  It was  It was  Oh it was just  You're out in the middle of nowhere  You know no one's gonna  Fuck things up  That was like when you  In your youth  You'd stay up  All fucking night  If you were in bed  With a chick  And like  You knew  Nothing was interrupting it  You'd stay up all night  Because you were just like  I don't want this to fucking 
[02:26:30]  This is great  It's like five in the morning  The sun's coming up  And you're like  Motherfucker  Why can't it be  Fucking midnight again  It was just the greatest thing  And you'd have to get up  And go back to fucking  Not getting laid for a month  It was tough growing up  Fucking tough shit  I went on  I had a six month dry spell  When I was 19  It was very scary  Very scary  You just kind of  Come to the thing  Am I ever gonna get laid again  It's never gonna happen again  It was terrible  And when I finally got it in again  I lasted  Half a second 
[02:27:00]  Maybe  And then I was like  Is this the rest of my life  You know  Because I heard  It goes out of school  Yeah yeah  I'm gonna be  Premature ejaculation guy  Great  Is this what I have to look  Is life over  Is it really like  A John Cougar Mellencamp song  There was a girl  That didn't wanna  Fuck once  I was spending the weekend  With her  And we were in our  Late teens  And the first night  She was like  Yeah we could sleep together  And stuff  And get all naked  And stuff  But I wanted to fuck her  And she was like  No I don't know  And stuff  So I just had 
[02:27:30]  Fucking mega rod  All night  All night  It's just  It's fucking  Dripping crazy glue  All fucking night long  Just a wreck  Turgid  Turgid  A turgid one  Pulsating teen penis  That I had  It was great  When that ligament  Is all tight up top  You know  Back in the good old days  Like anime  No it was fantastic  Was it like anime cock  You couldn't even push it down  Like a quarter of an inch  The thing was just  Wah  And so the next day  I wake up  Blue balls like a motherfucker  I'm like 
[02:28:00]  I couldn't even walk  And then the next night  We're in bed again  Naked  And she's finally  You know  Had enough drinking  I guess  Where she's like  Okay  Let's do this  And I'm like  Oh  Oh  Dude  It was saved up now  For a whole fucking  A night  Of having a rod  And not being able to come  And then that  I swear  The head  Touched the fucking lips  And  Bob  Just gone  All over 
[02:28:30]  I fire hosed her  The good news is  You're good to go  In another 20 minutes  Exactly  I don't even think  I lost my rod  It was just like  Fuck you  You're fucking  You're fucking  Back in there  Didn't worry about anything either  No rubber  No nothing  There's a couple times in my life  I've gone  Two loads with one rod  Yeah  Very rare occurrence  Yeah  It's going on here  That's got to be  Like a  Brand new girl  Very excited  You've got to be  Really excited  About what you're doing  That's not some  20th anniversary shit  Yeah 
[02:29:00]  That doesn't come  With one of those  Anniversary cards  Where it's like  I'm sorry  I don't tell you  I love you  As much as I should  I love the apology cards  Those are great  I don't say it  As much as I should  But no I love you  Here I'm giving you  Two fucking orgasms  With one rod  Ain't happening  Liddell's enjoying himself  Chuck you have anything to add  Or what  I don't know  Chuck's hanging  Chuck's hanging  He's just happy  He doesn't have to wear  That goofy hat  From yesterday man 
[02:29:30]  Can we get back  To that video  Ari's video  Oh my god  What was that  Ari's butthole  It's called  Ari's  He doesn't need to see  That shit covered  Deformed asshole  Chuck's a sensitive guy  He doesn't need to see this  No  I wouldn't think so  Can we get one of the guys  To pop that up for us  Is it right there  No it's not here  I'll look for it  Well I mean  So everybody knows  About the UFC  Strikeforce bio  What do you think  About that Joe  It's pretty amazing  It's good  Exciting  What I like is  That these guys  Are going to get to fight  It's going to take a while 
[02:30:00]  They're going to have to figure out  The contracts have to run out  On these fighters  And show time  And work all that stuff out  But now all the best fighters  Are all under one organization  Yeah  Yeah  You get some of those  Dream bouts you wanted to see  Fans always win  When that happens  Yeah  Who are you looking forward  To seeing fight  That wasn't able to  Alistair Overeem  Looking forward to seeing him  Fight as a heavyweight  Chuck knocked him out though  Back in the day  Back in the day  That was a great fight  That was a great fight  In pride  Yeah  That was a fun one 
[02:30:30]  Alistair's a bad motherfucker  Ever since he got to heavyweight  He's been doing much better  He's huge now  He's like 260  255  He's enormous  But he does very well  He won the Grand Prix  The K1 Grand Prix  So as a striker  He's like one of the top strikers  Like as far as  Being successful as a striker  And as a mixed martial arts guy  He's the heavyweight champ  Of Strikeforce  And he won the Grand Prix  For K1  So that's a big deal  Shit  He's the one I'm most excited about seeing  Gilbert Melendez  Another one  Nick Diaz 
[02:31:00]  Fedor  Where are we at with that  You know  I think Fedor  Should be fighting at 205  I mean Fedor's smaller than Chuck  I mean Chuck  You know  Obviously long time 205 champion  I mean you walk around  Like what  225  Something like that  230  Yeah  That's what Fedor fights at  But fat  You know  And Chuck's not fat  Walking around at 225  230  I mean frame wise  The guy could be a middleweight  Right  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  He's  Yeah  Wow  You see some of the guys  Like you know  Like Rich Franklin  The guy who cuts a lot of weight  To get down to 185  Yeah  Physically he's probably bigger than Fedor  You know 
[02:31:30]  But Fedor's a  He's a bad motherfucker  No doubt  But he's too small  For the biggest guys in the division  That Bigfoot Silva fight  Proved that to me  I mean that fucking giant motherfucker  Got on top of him  And was hammer fisting him into oblivion  And I was like  You know  This is a mismatch  Weight wise  There's no way  This guy  We got one guy who's cutting down  From 285 to 290  To get to 265 weight class  And he got another guy  Who's fat at 230  He just doesn't line up  You know  He's just too  After a while  I mean in the old days  You could pull that off 
[02:32:00]  But when it gets to a certain point  The competition gets fierce  You have to be  As big as you can  For your division  You have to be  You know  As in shape as possible  You can't be walking around  With a big belly  And you know  Yeah  It looks great  You know  It's kind of fun  That this guy with a big gut  Was knocking everybody out  You know  Right  When he fought Brett Rogers  I don't know if they had a middle  Weight class  They should  I agree  I think maybe they will eventually  I think  Somewhere around  What do you think  Like 225  230  Think that's a good idea  Yeah  I'm not sure  They could  Yeah  They could do that  They do that 
[02:32:30]  There's some guys  That are  You know  You see  Like stand next to a guy  Like Brock  You know  And you see Brock  And Brock next to Fedor  That's a different weight class  Sure  There's just a different weight class  No question  But then a guy like Kane  Kane Velasquez  Is only about 240  And you know  And he beat the shit out of Brock  Yeah  Nice guy by the way  Yeah  We liked Kane  He's a motherfucker  Really  He's a motherfucker  Really nice in person  That guy  They were talking about that guy  For years before he broke out  He's got like creepy conditioning 
[02:33:00]  Yeah  Heavyweight  Yeah  It doesn't even make sense  He outworks like middleweights  Lightweights  I mean he's like  He's like the most conditioned guy  In the gym apparently  So he can  And he's a heavyweight  A lot of stamina  Yeah  You know it's funny  His trainer  They said this after  The Ben Rothwell fight  He fought Ben Rothwell  And Rothwell was upset  That they stopped the fight  He was just getting  The fuck beat out of him  I mean  Kane Velasquez  He's just all over him  And then Javier Mendes  Says  Well  They were probably thinking  That the storm  Was going to end eventually  But the storm never ends 
[02:33:30]  With Kane  Jeez  Just the fucking thought  Of the storm never ends  You never want to hear that  Never want to hear that  Never stops fucking  Punching you  And kicking you  Until you're beating  The fuck out of your head  He doesn't get tired  I've never seen a heavyweight  That has that kind of conditioning  Wow  What about UFC 128  What do you like  We talked to Jones on the phone  He was a cool guy  It's very interesting  He's got more hype behind him  I think  Than anybody I've ever seen  In the history of the division  Like young contenders coming up  You know  With a limited amount of fights 
[02:34:00]  I mean when Chuck was  A contender before  You know  Chuck was the uncrowned champion  Before  I mean everybody always  Although people behind the scenes  Knew that he was going to beat Tito  When he fought him  It was always known  That eventually one day  They're going to have to get him together  So it was like  Chuck had so much experience  Before he got there  But John Jones has only been doing MMA  For three years  That's the ridiculous thing  I mean he's just gone from  You know  From the first fight with Andre Guzmau  All the way through  To the last fight with Ryan Bader  And never been in  A tiny bit of trouble  Well they learned on the shoulder 
[02:34:30]  You guys  Who had to pretty much  Learn on your own  What the best thing to do  Best training  You know  Best mixture of martial arts  It was creative back in the day  Yeah  And it was trial and error  Kind of a thing  You know  You realize  You can't just go in there  Knowing one thing  Because this guy's going to come in  And fucking put you on the mat  And kill you  But now I guess  These guys are getting better  In a shorter period of time  Which will give them  I guess longer careers  Well they see right away  When you enter into the sport 
[02:35:00]  Right now  You see full complete  Mixed martial artists  And those are the guys  That people are imitating  And kids from now  Like there's this commercial  With these kids  That train at the tap out gym  These kids are like  Seven, eight years old  Yeah yeah  Have you seen that commercial  I've seen that shit  What these motherfuckers  That's fucked up man  Getting flying arm bars  And high kicking each other  And they're little kids  You know  They're learning MMA  From the beginning  Seven, eight years old  Can you imagine  I was there for Chuck's debut  What Chuck was different  The difference between Chuck  And all the other guys before him 
[02:35:30]  Is that all the other wrestlers  Were trying to take the fight  To the ground  And they would get on top of you  And pound on you  But what Chuck did  Was make guys stand up  That was like the first time  That anybody ever done that  I always said  Yeah well when I came in  When you came in  There's three different elements  You had to learn  And most people came in with one  And learned the other two  I came in with two  And I had to learn one  I had to learn jiu jitsu  So I mean I had that advantage  In the beginning  I was able to keep guys  Strike  They were wrestlers  Striking with me  They weren't comfortable  And plus it puts them 
[02:36:00]  Somewhere where they're uncomfortable  Because they're not used to striking  They're not used to being  And it frustrates them  They can't take me down  I was there for Chuck's debut  And the funny thing was  They found out that Chuck was a wrestler  Right before I go out  Tell him  John Peretti  Yeah John Peretti  Come to me  I found out I was a wrestler  Before I go out  He's like  You know if you want to come back  You need to keep this on your feet  Because I'm fighting a boxer  I'm like  Okay  I'll try  Yeah they used to make guys do things  They used to make guys stand  Like this was famous  For the Elite XC  That company that went under 
[02:36:30]  That was banking on Kimbo Slice  And all that  Oh right  Yeah yeah  They used to have a ground clock  Where if you were on the ground  For like 30 seconds  A little alarm would go off  And they would stand you back up  They made you stand up  Yeah  It was famous  Gary Shaw would tell people  Backstage  You know  They reported on it  They would tell him  Keep this fight standing  You know  We want to see a good knockout  I remember a lot of times  I saw when Chuck would fight  Which always perplexed me  You'd get a guy  He'd be on his back  And you'd be smashing him in the face  And I'd be like  This guy's done 
[02:37:00]  And then you'd back off  And let the guy get up  And I'm like  Why are you letting him get  You fucking have him  And I'm trying to put him away  And I have him hurt  I figure out he's not quitting right now  And I just step back  Because I figure I can hurt him better  Standing up  Jesus  It's a calculated maneuver  Yeah I guess so  Because I was always like  Oh he's pounding him  This guy's just got him  He's fighting enough  So they're not going to stop it  Alright get back up  Because I've got him hurt  I don't want to let him rest down there  You're probably thinking about  The Jeremy Horn fight 
[02:37:30]  Yeah yeah  Yes he was laying down there  And you were pounding his face  Yeah because I guess  Now he's got to stand up  And now he can't just lay back  And worry  Now he's got to worry  About his legs and everything  Yeah sometimes when guys  Get a guy hurt  And then they get on top of him  The guy can grab a hold of you  And wrap a hold of you  Even from the bottom  And save himself  Yeah  And just kind of clear  His cobwebs out  As a first if he's  Actually standing up with you  So Chuck was just like  Alright get up motherfucker  Oh shit I'm going to punch you  Standing up  I got someone  I figure I can put  I can hit him harder  Standing  So I'm up 
[02:38:00]  Wow  Accurate so  Wow  It works  So you're obviously  Taking Shogun over Jones huh  No no I'm not  No I don't know  I misread what you were saying  No I just said  There's an amazing amount  Of hype behind this kid  I mean he's  Look the reason the hype  Is behind him  Is because he's  Incredibly talented  Right  I mean I always describe him  As like an insect  And not in a bad way  But like  You ever see an ant move  Like something big  They do it like effortlessly  Yeah  That's what it's like  With this kid  He like  He tosses people around  And he does it like  Effortlessly  It's like  It's weird how strong he is 
[02:38:30]  Like he grant  He does this  He does this thing  Where he gets guys  In double over hooks  And he flips them  Through the air  Where their feet  Are over his head  It's a lateral drop  But the way he executes it  It's like  Hardly anybody does that  In MMA  And not the way  This kid does it  And he does it  On high level guys  And sends them  Flying through the air  And it doesn't even look like  He's straining  Doing it  He takes everyone down  I mean  No one had been able  To control Ryan Bader  The last guy that he fought  Like that 
[02:39:00]  He just takes them down  Gets on top of them  Squashes them  Chokes them  Who do you want Sean  You know  I'd like to see  Both of the guys  I think it's going to be a fight  I don't necessarily want  One guy another  It would be interesting to see  I mean it's a  It's a test for Jones  But you know  He's a tough kid  I've only seen a couple of his fights  But he's a tough kid  He's physically so talented  But Shogun's an assassin  Shogun is a real professional  Jones got in his face  At the weigh-in  Or at the press conference  Kind of interesting  And he got like right in Shogun's face 
[02:39:30]  And Shogun just turned away  Oh really?  I'm not going to play this  I'm not going to look at you  I'm not doing this  Shogun's been around a long time  You just made that fight  Even more interesting  No Shogun's an assassin  What other fight do you like?  Saturday  Tomorrow I guess already  Wow  What else is on the card?  Uriah Faber  Uriah Faber  Then Eddie Weinland  That's a great fight  Eddie Weinland was at one point in time  The 135 pound champion  And he's trying to get back to it  And Uriah dropped down to 135  Uriah is a fucking beast at 135  Yeah  That's a great fight 
[02:40:00]  What else is on the card?  I don't know  I've got to look it up  What the fuck are you?  I don't know  I've got to look it up  What else is on the card?  Reed  What's that?  Kamal Shogun's Miller  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Jim Miller and Kamal Shogun's  Jim Miller from New Jersey  He's a fucking animal  Jersey guy  That kid's a savage  I love that kid  Him and his brother  Dan Miller  And Dan Miller fights Nate Marquardt  There's a lot of good fights  It's a good card  Where's Dana?  Why didn't  He's probably busy with the merger  Because they just bought Strikeforce  Like a couple of days ago 
[02:40:30]  So it's just  I think it came out on Tuesday  Is that what it was?  Something like that  I don't know  Were there any differences though  With Strikeforce?  Like that  Rules?  Yeah  That they might have trouble  Incorporating into  Only elbows  They didn't allow elbows  They didn't allow elbows  Okay  How do you feel about that?  Some guys don't like elbows  Because they think that it stops fights  Because it cuts  What do you think about that?  Well I mean  I don't like taking anything out anymore  But I mean  It's  But  I mean I thought  When they took knees to the head  On the ground out  I think if you're going to  Take one out over  I think they should have 
[02:41:00]  Left that in  And took elbows  The knee to the head  The knee to the head  I remember seeing those  And just going  Oh  Oh  But it was great to watch  To keep people from shooting  Land a few of those  The first shot  And it's like  Hey  I don't want to shoot again  Did I hear that right?  Chuck is bummed  That they took the knee to the head  Yeah  Well you don't know  Chuck fought  Old school Valley Tudo  I know  I know  No gloves  He fought Pele in Brazil  In one of those  Old school Valley Tudo tournaments  Where they had 
[02:41:30]  They fought in a ring  And the bottom rung  Of the ropes  Yeah  Was a net  So that you couldn't  Slide out under  Oh shit  So Pele  Is stuffed into the corner  In the net  And Chuck is just  Smashing him  Through the net  It's one of the most  Brutal fights ever  I gotta see that  Is it online stuff?  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I gotta check that out  Chuck Liddell vs Pele  One 30 minute round  Yeah  Really?  Wow  30 minute round  Wow  Bare knuckles  That's just like  Yeah 
[02:42:00]  Stop soccer kicks  Everything  That's fight club shit  Oh yeah  Yeah it is  And it's in Brazil  Yeah  You know  No one's stopping that  His manager was the  Referee by the way  I walked in  I walked out  Oh no  I walked out  Come on  Come on  What is that  WWE  What the fuck  Is that  WWE shit  You're right  You wanna hear some  Spooky shit about Brazil  Brazil has a very high  Rate of infestation  Of a toxin  Or a 
[02:42:30]  Parasite called  Toxoplasma  And it's a cat parasite  And listen to this shit  There's a parasite  That affects rats  And it makes rats  Sexually attracted  To the smell of cat piss  Where they lose their mind  Their balls swell up  And they can't wait  To get around cat piss  They get around the cat piss  And obviously there's a cat there  The cat eats the rat  So the cat gets it  And then the cat  Gives it to people  When people touch cat shit  Or when the cat shit  In the grass  And then you know  Somehow or another  People get in contact with it  Well when it affects 
[02:43:00]  Human beings  It makes men  More aggressive  It makes them jerks  And it makes them  More sexually active  And it makes women  More promiscuous  And it makes them  More sexual  And it literally  Has infested 66%  Of the population  Of Brazil  I mean if you look  At Brazil  You look at their culture  That is Brazil  The men are  Fucking animals  They're crazy  And the women  They all have big asses  They're all sexual  And promiscuous  Half naked  It's the fucking culture  Of Brazil  Is shaped by a parasite 
[02:43:30]  Based on fucking  Rots and cat shit  It's crazy  Not only that  But they're also  Making a direct correlation  Between successful  Soccer teams  And higher rates  Of infestation  Of toxoplasma  Because it makes  Men more reckless  Can they test for this  They're more aggressive  They can  They know for sure  That people have this  A lot of people  Have it  66% of the population  Of Brazil  50 million Americans  Are infested by it  Especially places  Rural areas  Where there are a lot  Of wild cats  Yeah  Oh man 
[02:44:00]  I never heard that  Pretty fucking nuts  Man  But when you look  At Brazil  You go  Why is this one country  So wild and crazy  Yeah  It's a fucking worm  In your brain  There's the explanation  Literally  That's nuts man  That is fucking nuts  It's fucking really nuts  To wrap your head around that  But it makes sense  If you've been to Brazil  And you see like  How those people  It's a wild ass place  Is it as wild as they say  I've never been  I've been to Sao Paulo  I got slapped by a transvestite  In a car  I was trying to take a picture  Of him, her, whatever  Yeah  She reaches in  Smacks me in the fucking face  And starts screaming 
[02:44:30]  And starts shaking the door  I'm in a car with like  10 trained killers  We're all leaving  The Abu Dhabi  The tournament  Mark Lehman's in the car  Big Country's in the car  And I get bitch slapped  Big Country had a great picture of her  Bitch slapped by a fucking tranny  She just had a face  Like this crazy made up face  And she was a tranny  Like they're fucking nuts sexually  I'm sure the guys  Let you alone after that right  They didn't bother you  About what happened  Oh we were all laughing for days  It was hilarious  They fucking didn't let that one go  I mean she was  She was begging for money 
[02:45:00]  Or to suck cock  Or whatever  I don't know  Portuguese  Something  I don't know  Portuguese  She wanted some  Some form of attention  Something to do with the car  Yeah  Hey one more UFC question  I wanted to ask Dana  But we don't have them today  New York  What the fuck  New York's a mess man  It should have been done already  Yeah well it's political  You know I don't know what it is  But everybody knows  Is it the boxing thing  Is it way too strong  I don't know  It's a good question  I don't know the root of it all  I don't know  Well the people that are making that decision  Of course trying to get UFC in New York  Would they go to Jersey  To check out how it's run 
[02:45:30]  And how it's handled  I don't know  You know  A good take on it  If it made sense  They would have done plenty of that  By now  It's been there enough times  It's unbelievable  Yeah we've been coming to Jersey  Can you imagine  You guys going to  Fucking Madison Square Garden  That would be huge  I'm great with that  That would be great  And it should be  You know it should be  It's all guaranteed  It's all corrupt politicians  But last time we had Dana  And it's been a while now  He was convinced  It was right around the corner  But it's not  Didn't pass last time  You know I don't know 
[02:46:00]  I don't know how all this stuff works  Who left New York and what else  There's a few other states  As far as the biggies  There's three big ones  Was it Connecticut and  We did Connecticut in the casinos  But that's an Indian casino  Oh right okay  It's different  Yeah yeah  Right  Don't have to pay attention  To white man law  But New York it's ridiculous  You got Boston  The fact that you have boxing  You got Boston  Yeah yeah boxing  The fact that there's boxing is legal  But MMA is illegal  That's just ignorant  We say that every time  When you get into the UFC a little bit  It's tough to watch boxing 
[02:46:30]  I'm sorry  Yeah  It really is  It is  Although you know  I do still enjoy a good boxing match  Because you know  It's like  I like a good jujitsu match  You know  I like watching a good wrestling match  You know  But there's  The big picture of MMA  Where it's all together  Is more exciting than anything  Yeah  That's the big ball of wax  Hard to argue that  But you know  Like I watched the Miguel Cotto  The Ricardo Mayogra fight  Last weekend  It was a good fight  It was interesting  It was a good boxing match  Yeah  But like Ope says  I find it hard to even tune into boxing anymore  Because you know what  You really don't know what you're going to get 
[02:47:00]  Yeah  Sometimes you can get the most boring fucking fight  It's a lot of boring  What do you think happened to boxing?  Stop clinching  You motherfuckers  Too many belts  Hit each other  That's definitely part of it  When we were growing up  We were all more or less the same age  When we were growing up  Boxing was like  Fuck  It was also because there was no MMA back then  True  If it was MMA back then  It would have taken over  Just like it take over now  You think Muhammad Ali would have tried some MMA?  He did  He fought Antonio Inoki  He fought him in some crazy fight  Oh no that's when he was just on his back  The whole thing  Well he kicked the shit out of his legs  The wrestler was  That's right  It's a smart move 
[02:47:30]  What do you want to do  Stand up with Muhammad Ali?  No  Would you call that  You call that he was trying MMA?  I don't know  I mean it was something different  That was kind of a spectacle  Yeah it was kind of a spectacle  The wrestler just stayed on his back  And kicked the shit out of Ali  I think if you know  There was a situation like this now  If it was in the 70s  Where there was like some guy like Cain Velasquez  That was getting real popular  And he was a heavyweight champion  And then there was Muhammad Ali  Who was the heavyweight champion of boxing  Yeah  Ali probably would have had to do it  Yeah yeah  He probably would have been  I mean he had such an incredible ego 
[02:48:00]  Yeah to be the greatest  He would have had to  Just learn how to sprawl  You know  Yeah  Go down to pit  Do a little training with Hackleman  Work on some techniques  We're going to take a quick break  And Ari's asshole awaits  It's right there on the screen  Oh great  He's in mid-wipe  So  You don't want to see it  Juclam  Juclam uncensored online  Google it  You don't want to see it really?  Yeah you do  You want to see it Chuck after the break?  You can't unwind  It's not gay  Remember you cannot unwatch it  You're talking about a guy  Who fought bare knuckle in Brazil  He'll look at some assholes 
[02:48:30]  Throw it up on the screen  Alright more with Joe Rogan  Are you promoting anything Joe?  No  Joe Rogan on Twitter  But you have plenty of followers  Chuck you promoting anything?  Not really no  Just hanging  I liked it  I like when guys just come by to hang  Penn might come by and hang today  Yeah we'll see  You like Penn?  Yeah very much  Penn rules  He's a good dude  I like that guy  He was on Fear Factor  Was he?  Yeah him and Teller  Oh shit  Yeah  Were you ever on mushrooms on Fear Factor?  No just the weed  And I said  Never did it on the mushrooms 
[02:49:00]  You ever done stand up on mushrooms?  No  Yeah  Yeah but not  But not real high  You were coming down from it  I mean I can't really say  I mean I was able to talk  So it couldn't have been that strong  Did I see you on Dave Chappelle  Doing a street bit for him?  Yeah that was a long time ago  I saw that the other day  An old rerun of Chappelle  And you're like handing out  Like gift certificates are money or something  We actually  I was walking down the street  I was walking down the street  I was playing at Caroline's  Just randomly walking down the street  And Dave Chappelle 
[02:49:30]  Is there with a mustache on  Yeah okay  Hey Joe  I'm handing out things for New York boobs  You want to be on my show?  And I was like yeah sure man  What do I have to do?  Was it buttons or something?  Yeah buttons  You got great New York boobs  Right  And all of a sudden  Joe Rogan is handing the button  To Chappelle's character  So I'm like what are you doing?  You know he's such an eccentric guy man  I really wish he would start like  Reeling touring  He basically sort of shows up at places  And does sets  He brings a band with him now  Yeah I heard about that 
[02:50:00]  There's a band with him  Some weird bluesy jazz band  To walk away from what he had going  Is just amazing  Not just walk away from that  He's one of the greatest comics  Of our generation  You know  I mean there's a few guys  That you look at  And you go well these guys  Are like at the top of the heap  You know  And he was one of them  Absolutely  And just yeah  He just walked away from it  And he had a really good gig  It wasn't like a two and a half men's situation  Where maybe creatively  You're a little embarrassed  But he was doing some good shit  Oh my god  When I did his show  When I did the Fear Factor thing  He was telling me  That they were giving him a hard time 
[02:50:30]  That they would tell him  Like how many times  He could say nigger  And they wanted him to stop saying nigger  And they wanted  They started fucking around  Because they think they could  Look  What idiots  If you've got a hit show  And you've got a bunch of people  That are saying  Look we want to advertise  But we want to ensure  That our product  Is not being misrepresented  Yeah  Do you think you could  Tone down the blackie  Do you think you could  Figure out a way to get him  Make it just as funny  Keep doing that  Yeah yeah  Do it by this rules  Make it funny  Keep it funny  But you know  We could fit within  These parameters  So we could advertise  You know we'll all make money 
[02:51:00]  And it'll  Shut up  Suits bro  Oh they're the worst  And you know  When you're trying to like  Figure out what's funny  And what's not funny  You can only leave that  To comedians  Yeah  Suits  You can't see  Look at it and go  If I water it down  It'll still be funny  No  But then  It'll be more lucrative  And let's figure out  A comfortable medium  Because it won't be funny  And it'll piss off the comic  Right  And you know  Chappelle just wound up  Getting tired of it all  That's amazing  And the dignity  To walk away from that 
[02:51:30]  And say fuck you  He clearly doesn't give a fuck  Because he could be touring  And selling out stadiums  And instead he just shows up  At comedy clubs  Like unannounced  Fuck it  And does like five hour sets  Yeah  And he's happy with it  Really  All the time  We need a Chuck Liddell  For these meetings  With the suits  Oh yeah yeah  You'll see it our way  That's it  Oh god  Chuck's too friendly  Yeah  Chuck's intimidating as fuck  But then when you get around him  You're like  This guy's so normal  And nice  So nice  Nice guy damn it  You need some fucking brooding  Mike Tyson character  That might bite somebody's ear off  At any moment  We have a short list of guys 
[02:52:00]  That scare the shit out of us  The first time we saw him  And certainly Chuck  It took a while for us  To relax around him  Because the first time you came in  You were breathing like a bull  And had that look  And we're like fuck  Do you find yourself  More easy going  Now that you're retired  I guess  Probably  I mean it just depends  I mean I think  Other times I come in  I had a fight coming up  So I was kind of in fight mode  Training  Yeah  You don't have to be in that  A little bit  A little  It's always a little more  I never noticed it  But all my friends always did  Oh fuck yeah man  You're a little more on edge 
[02:52:30]  A little more like  What?  What'd you do?  That's it  That's exactly what  Scared the shit out of us  What the fuck was that?  We got a couple of those looks  Nothing, nothing, nothing  We were in Vegas once  And I don't know  I don't know the particulars about it  But there was  There was two tables going on  There was our table  That was over here  And then there was a table  That was next to it  And at our table  Chuck was there  With a couple of his friends  And some  There was some  Dude  It was some drug dealer  Type character  Or something  I don't know who he was  And then there was some  Large black gentleman  And the large black gentleman 
[02:53:00]  Got quite mouthy  And he got yelly  And he was screaming  At someone's face  And Chuck stepped up around  Behind his buddy  And stood right in front  Of the black guy  And started talking to him  And the dude literally  Turned two shades  Lighter color  Like you could see  The look in his face  He was like  What the fuck  Have I gotten myself into?  Chuck Liddell  Is literally inches  From my  And I don't know  What Chuck was saying  Because it was loud  But you could see  Chuck looking at the guy  Going like this  Talking to him  And the guy was 
[02:53:30]  Shaking his head  Talking at the same time  Oh man  It was terrifying  You remember what you said  Chuck or no?  Yeah  I mean I just  Do you remember the situation?  Yeah I remember  He had a problem  With some small guy  I mean I don't know  What happened exactly  But it was like  Basically I was just  Letting him know  That you're not  Going to do anything  Just sit down  Go back to what you're doing  We can be cool  The dude's mouth opened  You're not  You're not doing anything  Yeah yeah  You can tell  He was high over  This isn't going any further  You know what I like about this  This is the nice version  We're here 
[02:54:00]  He was having a hard time  Getting oxygen to his brain  Because his mouth opened  In the shock  Because he was all angry  And aggro  And he was doing this thing  That a lot of dudes do  Where they get their  Knuckles above their head  And then they come down  With their fingers  Start pointing  He was doing this  And then when Chuck showed up  The hand dropped  And his mouth opened  Well you could tell  He was like  Having a hard time  Getting in air  He's like  Oh Jesus  I've got to stay calm  Because that's like  The worst situation  You could be in  It's like  This isn't just any  Schlepp coming over 
[02:54:30]  That you're like  Yeah I might be able  To take this guy  What a disaster  It's like no  It's Chuck Liddell  Yeah and it's not  No confusing  There's a fucking tattoo  On his head  The mohawk  Yeah  You know what you're getting  And he's staring at you  With that 100,000 yard stare  Oh that's brutal  That is brutal man  It was funny  We're going to take a quick break  I just want to see  If Penn's here  Yeah cool  Quick break  He is here  Oh fuck  This show  Just continues  Penn  Is Teller here too  Just Penn  Just Penn  Alright we'll wrap up next  With Joe Rogan 
[02:55:00]  Chuck Liddell  Ari and Penn  Stay there  The finest  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Just talking about  Now I've got to see that  Now we've got to talk about it  On the air  That sounds great  So we've got Joe Rogan  We've got Chuck Liddell  And now we've got Penn  Gillette  In the studio  Hello  And he already knows  What you were going to say  Live on the air  Because of this damn Twitter  The Twitter  They tell you everything  You know  They talk to you on the Twitter  They send you stuff  And they said 
[02:55:30]  And I apologize so much  You just  You're absolutely right  Whatever happened is true  I apologize for  You know what I just realized  Penn has some parts of his voice  Sound a bit like Jesse Ventura  Oh really  Yeah that's the libertarian part  There's something about his voice  And I was just thinking  Well what a great combination to be  Bullshit and bullshit  You know  Your show  Which is calling out bullshit  And his show  Which is embracing it  Complete bullshit  Loving it violently 
[02:56:00]  It could be a complete  Symbiotic relationship  Amazing  Just completely  Just cycling right through  Talking about thermite paint  Thermite paint  Turn down the trade centers  In those towers  Really?  Did they paint the walls  While people were working in there  Creaseball  False speed  Have you ever  Have you ever seen  A crew come in  To destroy a building  Yeah  With the work that has to be done  Before they actually  Press the button  And bring it down  You're telling me  They did that  While people were working in there  And didn't upset one cubicle 
[02:56:30]  Really Jesse?  Well I was a Navy SEAL  I know  Whatever  I serve my country  Did you?  I'm glad  Proud of your service  No I didn't  I'm sorry  But that doesn't mean  I believe that fucking  Someone went in with a paint roller  With a fucking coyote  From the Roadrunner paint  And fucking brought down  The trade center  You fucking nut  Thermite  Thermite paint  What's your Navy SEAL  Physics and chemistry change? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah yeah  I was a  Excuse me sir  I was a demolition man  He was a demolition man  Really?  We played this  We did this like Q&A thing  In Florida  Florida State University  And it was where  The  Don't tase me bro  Thing happened  It was in the actual room  That's great  Did you feel it in the air?  The guy that booked us  Was the guy that told  The police officer  Go over there  And shut that guy up 
[02:57:30]  And it was great  Because the culture  Of tase me bro  You know  Don't tase me bro  Is national  Right  But at this particular school  This guy stood up  And you know  The first question of the night  He stands up  And three video guys  Stand up with him  And he goes  I want to ask you a question  Mr. Gillette  And I go sure  And he goes  You did the bullshit show  Without watching  Building 7 go down  I'm calling bullshit on you  The 9-11 was a conspiracy  And he goes on  Yelling at me  And the great thing  Was the audience 
[02:58:00]  You know  1,200 people  Tase him  Tase him  Tase him  Tase him  The chant  Just starts  And it's really hard  Not to laugh your ass off  And he finishes point  And you know  I said no  I haven't watched  I certainly saw the video  But I didn't watch in detail  And yes  I've read some of the stuff  You said  But certainly not all of it  How can you go on TV  Without reading everything about it  Then no one can go on TV  You're right  About anything ever  But no  I am ignorant of some of this 
[02:58:30]  But the whole time  I'm talking to this guy  In like a standard  Kind of Q&A thing  The audience  Tase him  Tase him  Tase him  Just fabulous  Those 9-11 truthers  Some of them are so fucking crazy  You almost wonder  Whether or not  They're government agents  Designed  To make the 9-11  Conspiracy look ridiculous  To throw the monkey wrench in there  Yeah  To make it look silly  Like Joe Rogan  Really  Some of them are so over the top  Fucking crazy about it  But you know  I read this thing  And then I haven't been able  To find it since  So it's possible  When I say I read this 
[02:59:00]  It means I made it up  But the Lincoln assassination  The Kennedy assassination  Any big sort of huge tragedy  It seems like  15 years later  You know  10 years later  You get this whole  Conspiracy thing  That pops up  It seems to be just part  Of the way human beings  Deal with things  Because it's so hard  To believe  That Lee Harvey Oswald  One loser nut  Yep  Changed the world  That much  And it's so hard  To believe  Those 9-11 people 
[02:59:30]  Did that much  To everything  That much  You believe Lee Harvey Oswald  All acted alone  You know  Yes  Really  I'm not sure  There's stuff up there  But the thing  That convinces me the most  Is the Luis Alvarez  Who won the Nobel Prize  Physics  In like the 60s  Who was JFK's  Really good friend  There's a paper  That he wrote  In the Physics Journal  That just came out  In like  You know  68 or something  Luis Alvarez  That is 
[03:00:00]  Very compelling  He does the sound stuff  And that kind of thing  Although I've heard people  Very knowledgeable  Debating this  I've heard arguments  On both sides  That make me lean  One way or another  Back and forth  You go back and forth  They go  Oh I absolutely believe  It's a conspiracy  Wait I absolutely believe  It was one guy  What I think about is  The emotional thing  I so desperately  Want to think  It was a bigger cause  Than that  Right  That I fight against it  But that's  I think that's the whole  Gist of the conspiracy 
[03:00:30]  And why people embrace it  It's because  You want to feel like  You're safer  Than just a few guys  That can do  What they did on 9-11  You want to think that  It took some massive conspiracy  No  It took a few people  That really hate us  To do that  And that's it  Evil is so rare  Evil is so rare  You never encounter it  You encounter people  Who are wrong  All the time  You encounter people  Doing stupid things  All the time  But someone choosing  To do something evil  Is so rare 
[03:01:00]  That I don't think  We're good at processing it  Yeah  And I think we want to be  Part of something bigger  Sure  It's better to have  An evil god  Than no god  To some people  Right  Chaos is so frightening  And the fact  That we're all struggling  Desperately to do our best  And we still fuck things up  Is to some people  A horrifying thought  Didn't we all  Were we all into the impression  That like  The White House  And the Pentagon  And everything  Had these missile banks  That would come up  And shoot anything  Out of the sky  That was trying to come  Toward Washington  And then you realize 
[03:01:30]  No  It's just like  Any gig that you have  Any job you've ever had  People just fuck shit up  They drop the ball  They don't listen  To the guy next to them  And that's exactly  What happened  But even worse than that  They do the best they can  Yeah yeah  And that's the best they can  That's the scary part  There are times  When I have done  All my homework  All my preparation  Been focused  Worked hard  And still  Been a devastatingly  Incompetent fuck up  Yeah  And that's what terrifies me  Not on the bullet catch  That would be tragic 
[03:02:00]  The people  That don't prepare  And don't listen  To the guy next to them  That works into my world view  It's the guy  With a good heart  Who's smart  Working as hard as he can  That then fucks up my life  Just miss something  Yeah sure  You know  Doing his best  Doing his best  And a better job  Than I would be doing  And he's fucking it up  There's something intoxicating  About secret information  About uncovering secrets  And uncovering like  UFO shit  Like I have friends  That are just  Fucking obsessed  With UFOs 
[03:02:30]  And they're like  You know  Did you see the newest video  Like no matter what it is  They just  There was a great quote  From Spielberg  Which was just  This fabulous quote  Where he said  I'm so surprised  That with all the video  Technology  Everybody carries with them  We're not getting  More UFO video  I was kind of like  Wonder why that could be  Steve  Yeah  Let's think about that  Every single motherfucker  On the planet  Has video running 24 hours  And huh  No more videos  Coming out of UFOs  No matter what happens  Someone is videotaping it 
[03:03:00]  Yet in the 50s  60s  70s  We were getting  These still photos  Polaroids  UFOs all over the place  Now everyone's got it  The phones or cameras  And we don't see shit  We don't see much  You see some great CG work  That some people do  In their basement  And you're like  Wow it looks pretty good  But it looks too good  You know  I've seen a few of those  Where it looked like  A genuine flying  Some type of alien  Flying device  I think the idea  Of something from  Another planet  That has to come here  On a big metal ship 
[03:03:30]  Is just so archaic  Yeah  Like if there is  Something that's so advanced  You know whether or not  They've been around  Maybe they're in a solar system  That doesn't have  Asteroidal impact issues  And so they've been  Allowed to evolve  For a million years  Ahead of us  Yeah yeah  They can probably just  Go wherever the fuck  They want  It's a fog bank  Yeah exactly  They arrive in a fog bank  And they look like a tree  Yeah  Yeah you know what I mean  Why do they have to be  A metal ship  Evolution is not going toward  Intelligence or exploration  Evolution is a crapshoot 
[03:04:00]  And you can be  Very highly evolved  Like a cockroach  And not go to another planet  So another million years  Of evolution  Without the savannah  Without the looking  For 3D vision  For fruit  Without the walking upright  Without the campfires  Without all of that stuff  You get an entirely  Different outcome  So you can evolve forever  If it goes in that way  And it doesn't go  To intelligent life  Right I guess  But it can also go  Intelligent and not  Exploratory  Yeah why does  Interplanetary exploration 
[03:04:30]  Have to be the  Be all end all  Of intelligence  It's like well  They're so intelligent  Of course they'd be  Able to travel here  It's like maybe  That isn't their thing  Or maybe they don't  Know how to  Maybe they don't  Even want to  There are things  That I'm smart enough  To do that I don't do  You know what  There are things  There are things  Even a guy like me  I'm smart enough  To do certain things  I don't do them  Yeah I bet  Given the instructions  I could defuse a bomb  I choose not to  Yeah I saw her at Locker 
[03:05:00]  It doesn't look that tough  No  You put the suit on  You go in  You snip a few wires  But you know what  Don't cut that wire  It's always that  Yeah right right  Blue or red  Blue or red  Too late  I don't know  It probably feels  Pretty great  When you defuse a bomb  You know what  It probably does  I'm sure it does  I mean it feels  Awful awful awful awful  Great  Awful awful awful  Which is  Which you know  For sex  A lot of times  It's like  Awful awful awful  Great  Same feeling  Hey Penn  What are you doing in town  We know 
[03:05:30]  But for the radio audience  Because you saw something  Last night  We did Jimmy Fallon  Which was exciting  Because I got to be  In a room with Leon Russell  And the incredible thing is  We walk over to Leon Russell  You know just to blow him  He's the greatest guy in the world  I don't know who he is  Leon Russell  Piano player  Yeah he is  For Joe Cocker  But he's also just done an album  With Elton John  But he played piano  For Sinatra  Phil Spector  Everybody  Long gray hair  Long gray beard  You've seen this guy  Nuttier than a shithouse  Yeah you've seen this guy  And you know he's in like  A wheelchair  With a cane 
[03:06:00]  Just being so much  He's in a cane  With a wheelchair  Well no he was  He was in a cane  To get to the wheelchair  But he's got you know  This beautiful  Long white hair  Just crazy  Crazy  And we walk over to him  You know  And I just go  Hello Mr. Russell  My name is Penn  Teller  He goes hi  Nice to meet you  And he goes  Glad to hear you talk  Teller  And all of a sudden  It washed over me  That he knew something about us  And I'm like going  Why are you wasting your time  Watching Penn and Teller  When you could be playing the piano  But then I went after that 
[03:06:30]  And saw  I saw Book of Mormon  You know  Trey and Matt's show  Yeah  And I think  It might  Present company exclude it  It might be the greatest thing  I've ever seen  Wow  I could not believe how  It was just  It was so  You know  Art  The purpose of art  Is to inspire  And then it gets to a certain level  And it makes you want to give up  You know  You listen to Bach  And go  I don't have anything  Am I going to pick an instrument up  And really try to be  Proficient to this  No  This is so good  It is a moment 
[03:07:00]  Without even  A moment of cynicism  It's pure  It's beautiful  It's just loving  It's funny  Funny  Funny  And it takes apart  Religion in a beautiful way  But replaces with that  This kind of love and beauty  It's just  It's the greatest thing  Wow  They've been working on it  That's a fucking endorsement  They've been working on it  Seven years  Seven years  Yeah  And I  Afterwards  I saw Matt and Trey  And just said  I just couldn't 
[03:07:30]  And you know  I was so effusive  That they thought  I was bullshitting them  Oh really  It's like  Wait a minute  I think he's fucking with us  Trey that's the greatest thing  I've ever seen  And he went  Oh I was hoping you'd like it  I said no no  It really was  Because you go  It sounds like bullshit  There's so much Hallmark  Car shit out there  And I have seen  It's true  I have seen a zillion shows  And gone up and said afterwards  That was great  The episodes that they did  Of their show  Where they were drawing  Where they had Muhammad  And Muhammad was in a bear suit 
[03:08:00]  That was one of the most bizarre moments  In our culture  That this is tolerated  That this nonsense is tolerated  Where you're not even allowed  To draw this guy  To draw the figure of Muhammad  And you're going to  On comedy fucking central  You're going to go along with that  And censor this  But you know  There's the cartoonist in Seattle  Yeah  Who did draw Muhammad Day  Who was put into witness protection  You know  Not witness protection  But into witness  But put 
[03:08:30]  You know  Underground  Changed her name  And everything  With no money  From us  You know  We gave her no money whatsoever  She did it on her own dime  Lost  Her whole career  Which was a cartoonist  Which is a hard career to get  And you know  People want that a lot  Took all that away from her  Because she did draw Muhammad Day  And you know  People were saying  Well what could the government do  And I said  You know  Obama could go on  And say  You know  I have respect for religion  I really like it  I respect everybody's right  But you know  We have freedom of speech here  So I'm going to draw Muhammad 
[03:09:00]  And while I'm on the subject  I have  I have  I have  I have 75  FBI guys  Who have volunteered  To draw Muhammad with me on camera  And there's their name  And by the way  They're all packing  Yeah  And they're all happy to do that  So these people  You need to go after too  Because I think  You can show respect  But you should not  Force people to do something  Out of fear  Yeah  And respect and fear  Are two different things  Well they just take it  To the deepest level possible  We'll kill people  If you even draw our dudes 
[03:09:30]  We'll kill everyone  We'll kill you  You're not even allowed  To draw our guy  And that doesn't seem like  Just some radicals  Saying that  That seems a little  Kind of a creeps into  The mainstream part  Of that religion  I don't know  Or at least  At least the mainstream  Part of the religion  Isn't saying  Hey don't go killing people  For drawing Muhammad  They're like  Well you shouldn't draw them  Yeah  I'm not going to kill you  But you'll probably get killed  Salman Rushdie  Salman Rushdie still has to hide  Yeah  He's still hiding  That was in the 80s  Right  Ayaan Hirsi Ali 
[03:10:00]  You know who wrote Infidel  Who is my  You know she  I write her email  Now and again  Through incredible number  Of remailers  Wow really  And she says stuff like  You know  I'd  When I'm in Vegas  I'd like to come visit you  And I was right back  And go  Maybe  Yeah  Maybe you could just  See my children  And not me  But you know  She  I don't know  If you read the book  Infidel  But it's amazing  Her death threat  Tao Van Gogh  The filmmaker 
[03:10:30]  In Holland  In broad daylight  Stabbed  Through the heart  Oh yeah  With a note  That said  I'm going to kill  Someone's going to kill  Ayaan Hirsi Ali  So getting a threat  That is pinned  On your friend's chest  Through his heart  And kills him  How do you live  With that kind of terror  Yeah  You know  Just horrible  And she lives with this  All the time  I mean Salman  They've backed off  On a little bit  But Ayaan Hirsi Ali  I was talking to a security guy  That was handling her speaking  And said  We just finally gave up 
[03:11:00]  Wow  When she's going to appear  The death threats  Are so constant  She was supposed to speak  On this cruise  You know  A skeptic atheist cruise  And they just finally said  We can't have her on the ship  Wow  What was her  What is Infidel?  Infidel is her  Autobiography  She's a Somalian  And she went from  Being religious  And beaten by her father  And her clit  Slid off  You know  Cut off and shit  And all this stuff  To being an outspoken atheist  With everybody  In her family  And many people 
[03:11:30]  In the world  Trying to kill her  She went to the  Dutch parliament  And so on  And the story  Of Infidel is amazing  Because it showed you  Do not ask  The American military  To do something  You don't want them to do  They called  They called the U.S.  And said  We can't protect  Ayaan Hirsi Ali  She just got this knife  We're scared  We can't protect her  Can you guys do something?  And then she writes  About how  She's in her apartment  The day after  Special ops guys  From the U.S.  Just show up 
[03:12:00]  Wreck her cell phone  Take her out  She can't tell any friends  Put her on a plane  Fly her to Logan  Then get her  You know  A military plane  Fly her to Logan  And then drive her  To Maine  And then put her  In a little hotel  Where they rip out  All the phones  And everything  And put a guy  Sitting next to her  With an automatic weapon  And a guy out front  And say  Now you're safe  And she goes  No I want to talk  To my friends  I want to do something  They go  Our job is just  To keep you alive  We don't care  About anything else  And the whole book 
[03:12:30]  Is her sitting  Talking to the guys  Going  But I need to have  Some sort of life  And he goes  Hey  You're not dying  On my watch  Can I go out  And get something to eat  I'll send someone  To get you anything  You want  All I know is  You're not dying  On my watch  You're not dying  So she just basically  Outlined  She told the story  Of her life  And yet  That was enough  To  Well no  She also  Criticized the religion  Being an apostate  Is the worst thing  You can do  It's worse than 
[03:13:00]  Being us  It is being a member  Of a religion  And then leaving it  And she was  A devout Muslim  And now she is  An atheist  And you can't  Do worse than that  Wow  And she's a woman  Which is  Another  That's the first  Strike against her  Yeah  So it's  And she got this  Award that we got  We got it one year  And she got it the next  For this free thought  Type award  And we had to do  This video  That you know  Congratulated her  And kind of gave  The award over to her  And I said 
[03:13:30]  You know  We're completely  Behind you  Unless by being  Behind you  It means a fatwa  Is on our heads  In which case  We think you went  A little too far  And she is also  Unbelievably hot  Really  So she is smart  Brave  And sexy  Without a clit  But really  Yeah  It doesn't help me  But she's an amazing  One of the true heroes  Of our time  And you keep in touch  With her  Well not much  I mean I don't 
[03:14:00]  We're in the same state  At the same time  Yeah  Close to each other  Don't try to get through  To her  But I mean if you  If you want her  On your radio show  No that's okay  She will come on  We got Joe Rogan  And she will come on  And she'll do it free  But it is something  Like $150,000  Of security  Wow  And then once you  Have her sitting  At the mic  Everybody is trying  To kill you  Well actually  They're not trying  To  What a crazy  Fucking religion  Do you really think  That the way to  Combat that is for 
[03:14:30]  Someone like Obama  To get on TV  And actually say  Something like that  And draw a picture  How do you  Somehow or another  Calm down  I don't know  That storm  It's the question  Is whether you  And I don't know  The answer to this  Except for myself  Which is I won't  But I don't know  Whether it is  Better to show respect  Or whether to stand up  Stand up against it  Yeah  When the Danish cartoons  Came out  And American papers 
[03:15:00]  Wouldn't print them  Right  I mean that's a  Very big decision  And they say  They didn't print them  Out of respect  But it's fear  Well yes  That's the whole argument  I mean if  If they printed them out  If they did not  Print them out of respect  That is a defense  Defensible position  If they didn't  Print them out of fear  Then we've got to  Rethink that  Home of the Brave thing  Well you know what  Yeah  I've seen  I've seen pictures  In the paper  Of piss Christ  Yeah sure  Where it's the crucifix  In urine  In the jar 
[03:15:30]  With the light behind it  And  Mapplethorpe  And the  Yeah  No that's  Saran  Saran  What the hell  Was his name  It begins with an S  Mapplethorpe  Didn't he do  That wacky guy  Mapplethorpe  Didn't do that one  There was the  But it was the same time  Mary  Mary made out of  Elephant manure  There was another one  You can say shit  You're on serious  Yeah yeah  Manure  Shit  But they put that  In the paper  Now out of respect  For the religion  Because they knew  Catholics were very upset  With this  They probably shouldn't 
[03:16:00]  Have put that in  But they know  That the place  Isn't going to get  Firebombed  For the most part  I used to do a bit  About how you never see  A catholic suicide bomber  Because none of us  Believe in it  That much  Catholics are like  I'm not really sure  Right  We did bullshit  It's out of my head  We did bullshit  For eight years  And we were  I mean just last night  At the Book of Mormon  I had a chiropractor  Come up  And start  Hastling me  Giving you a little shit  Yeah  For that  But it's amazing  People say 
[03:16:30]  You know  Why do you guys  Pick on Christians  And why do you  Not mention Islam  And the answer is  Very simply  Because Christians  Do not hurt  Other people  Overall  Overall  Yeah  We have  Abortion  That anti-abortion  People have killed  Some people  And that is  Unforgivable  And horrible  But  The fact is  That I am able  To say  Whatever I want  About Christianity  Without fear of violence  And one thing  I learned on bullshit 
[03:17:00]  Was incredible  Respect for Christians  I mean I go to bat  For them all the time  Because I would get  Letters saying  It's nice to see you  Stating your opinion  Passionately  I believe in Christ  I'm praying for you  And I love your show  And you do a wonderful job  Stuff like that  I mean just  If you want to talk  About the purity  Of the marketplace  Of ideas  You know  Thomas Jefferson's dream  I'll tell you  The Christians  In America  In the 21st  Century  Have gutted fucking down 
[03:17:30]  And I don't know  I don't know  If I believed  In my heart  That abortion  Was murder  I don't know  If I would have  The restraint  That so many people  Have on that  And of all the shows  We did  We get asked  You know  Who gave you  The most hassle  And the answer  Is the 9-11  Conspiracy people  They're the only ones  That showed up  At our offices  And threatened people there  And called people  Who worked on the show  At home  What do you think  Happened to  Christians  To make them  The calm Christians  That they are today 
[03:18:00]  It's just that  It's so successful  Because if you go back  To the Inquisition  Galileo  They did go through  Their phase  You couldn't even say  That the earth  Wasn't the center  Of the universe  They threatened to burn you  If you fucking said  The earth  Wasn't the center  I think one of the things  That happened to them  Was the enlightenment  And nothing that happened  To them was America  Which is a really  Really good idea  Some girls  Jump up  I guess she's engaged  Are you engaged?  Yes I just got engaged  A second ago  Oh congratulations  Look at you 
[03:18:30]  I know  Oh man  It's a mashup  Marriage  Where's your guy?  He's right here  Congratulations  Hey there you go  Nicole from the morning mashup  Very good  Congrats  Weird timing  But congratulations  That's how chicks  How important marriage is  I know  We're in the middle  Of talking about  Religion  And freedom  And people dying  And what happened  In America  Oh my god  Look at the precious  Look at the precious  She held that ring up 
[03:19:00]  She held that ring up  We all had to pretend  That we cared  And we didn't get  The same  We didn't get  The same reaction  From the guys  Also we were  Really good at reacting  Yeah  Congratulations  She felt so entitled  She opened up the door  While a radio show  Was going on  Yes  Had no idea  What we were talking about  Going deep  And led with the magic ring  She led with her ring  Came in first  First yeah  Precious  Holy shit  That was really weird  I'll tell you a marriage story 
[03:19:30]  The answer is  Enough of that  Take a seat  Listen to Uncle Anthony  I've got to set you straight  I'll spin you a yarn  About marriage  It's a little thing  Called divorce  Yeah  And we can even spell it  Because it comes to music  We still haven't seen  Ari's asshole  Oh great  What are we doing Joe  You want to see  Ari's asshole  Sure  Hit play on that thing  What is this called again  Jewclam  Jewclam  You can go to  Jewclam.com  No I think  It's already up here  Go  You got any sound

[03:20:30]  You got hemorrhoids  You got hemorrhoids  Ari  I got a piece of shit  Sticking out of my ass  It's precisely as advertised  Listen  I'm not one to sell you  A bag of  Faith things  False bill of goods  No this is exactly  What it's supposed to be  Is that it  Or we go close up  Oh no there's too much time  Left in this video  We have another minute  To go  Oh his pants are up 
[03:21:00]  That's not a good sign  Oh my god  You've had girls  Lick your ass before  One girl lifted  She was  Now it's recapping  Yeah  I wasn't into it  I was like  This is like licking my knee  This doesn't do anything  For me  His asshole's calloused up  Yeah that really is  Wow Ari  He said he doesn't like  Having his ass licked  It's right  When it's mid inflamed  It's bad  Really  Yeah it is  That was a bad one  Wow you really aren't shy  When it comes to things like that  I thought it was shit  Sticking out of my ass  I didn't realize  That it was an inflamed hemorrhage  I thought I just hadn't 
[03:21:30]  Gotten it all the way  So you wanted a second opinion  On the internet  What's eight months later  All about  That'll follow you  Oh we took a picture of it  Eight months later  Because he wanted to let us know  That it's all healed  Oh god  That looks like Homer's mouth  That really is  It's disturbing  Now this is  Much later  He's going to show you  That it's all healed up  Much better  Wow infrared  That's crazy  What's wrong you guys 
[03:22:00]  We got issues  We're bored  Being stand up comedians  Not having boundaries  Isn't always good  Yeah that's true  You kind of do  JoeRogan.net  A little advertisement  Sure  Let people know  Where to look at Ari's asshole  Yeah well you got that  And then his big ball bag  What the hell is going on here  Yeah Penny's got a huge ball bag too  Oh yeah that's good  Book of Mormon  One of the greatest works  Of the century  Book of Mormon  Right up until this  When does Book of Mormon open up?  I don't know when it opens 
[03:22:30]  Oh that's right  He gets cost $519 for Charlie Sheen  What?  Up to  Wow  Sold out New York City shows  What is he going to do?  Next week it opens  Next Thursday I believe  Next Thursday I'm going  We need to go  I'll go  What is  It's a play right?  It's a musical  A musical  And a musical  Did you like Bigger Longer and Uncut?  Yes  Loved it  Loved it  I believe it's better than that  And it's live  And it's amazing  Team America is the funniest thing 
[03:23:00]  I never laughed harder in a movie  Than Team America  I believe it's better than both of those  That's incredible  That's incredible  Why don't they put it out  Like as a movie?  Well I mean  When you see it  It's the perfect form for it  Oh really?  I mean one of the cool things about it is that it's not a movie  You know what I mean?  They're actually doing it  They're there in front of you  And you have all the actors really doing it in real time  Is great  And you know  Another thing  If we're going to rave about the United States of America  And the audience is just out of their minds cheering 
[03:23:30]  It's this really  It's as purely blasphemous  As it could be  With a humanist  Just love everybody  Point of view  And the audience is going  Absolutely crazy  If you have any cynicism in you  Like everything on Broadway is shit  And they just do this fucking Spider-Man garbage all the time  This will just wash that away  Not only will you love Trey and Matt  And everyone in the cast  You will also love everyone in the theater with you  When you say blasphemous though 
[03:24:00]  Isn't Mormonism in and of itself blasphemous?  Well not within the Mormon church  But this is blasphemous to whatever supernatural beliefs you have  They are contradicted in this shit  Have they taken any shit for this?  I believe none  Because we're living in the fucking United States of America  Where you're allowed to say what you want  And you know something?  We really believe that  Mormons are pretty relaxed about it  I've had a bunch of Mormons come up to me  And say they thought my Mormon jokes were funny  Oh really?  Yeah  I used to do a bit about 
[03:24:30]  You know  The reason why Mormons are against gay marriage  Is because  If someone can talk you into being a Mormon  They can probably talk you into sucking their dick  But they have to be careful of that shit  You know?  God damn  And I've had a lot of Mormons who come up to me  They think it's funny  That is a fabulous joke  That's true  That's why they're scared of it  That's why they're spending so much money  They don't know  You know?  They don't want to all of a sudden find themselves in love with a man 
[03:25:00]  And not even know how it happened  But there you go  You know  You've got a religion that is completely whack job  Yeah, yeah  In every single way  And yet  When you point out that it's whack job  They do not hit you  They do not threaten you  It is astonishing  You don't have to worry  They don't even do economic boycotts really  They're very nice people  Very nice  And they kind of win you over  By just  I mean  Such politeness  So nice in every way  You know 
[03:25:30]  Because I've never had a drink of alcohol in my life  And I've never had any recreational drugs  Which I know you don't approve of, Joe  But you're so tolerant  Disturbing  You're so tolerant about it  And I will go to  I will go to like  You know  Every doctor  Things I could show you  Every doctor in Vegas  Is a Mormon  You know  Really?  Oh yeah  A huge number of Mormons  And I'll go in  And they'll go through the whole thing  And go  Oh  You must be a Mormon  And I'll go  Well except for that  You know  Believing in God thing  Yeah but you got everything else 
[03:26:00]  Just one little step  It's not one little step  That's a pretty big step  You don't go from not drinking coffee  To believing a guy got golden tablets  From Jesus in the 19th century  In upstate New York  That's a really big step  Not only that  He was 14  Who's not full of shit at 14?  Everyone's a god damn  Joseph Smith found these things at 14  And when they said  Well where are they?  Oh the angels came and took them away  Yeah they took them  He had a magic rock  A seer stone 
[03:26:30]  That he would use to look through  To see these golden tablets  To read them  Yeah  You just held up your iPhone  Which you can't see shit through  Yeah  That was a very bad example  That wasn't a very bad example  He tried to do it through the case  He held up a glowing rock  He said he thought he had a rock  That he could see things  And then he held up something  That you could see things in  That's your whole argument  Almost proving the point  That he might have seen something in that  Well Joseph Smith's a known con man too  That's the most amazing thing  Yeah  I mean much like  You know  The guy who created Scientology 
[03:27:00]  L. Ron Hubbard  L. Ron Hubbard  Was just a  A fucking science fiction author  Mediocre science fiction writer  Hilarious  I know  Yeah the whole thing with Scientology  I finally like  I had heard about it so much years ago  That I was like  I want to know what this is  And as I'm reading it  I thought I  I thought it was a goof  On the religion  I actually thought  I was reading a parody  Of the religion  It's like  Wait this is really it  Theans and fucking  Holding on to the censors  Yes  You have to drink  And there are actual 
[03:27:30]  Aliens in the battle  And throwing the fucking  People into the fire  What the fuck  Zinu  Yeah Zinu  I was in Germany  And they had a  24 hour camera  That was trained  On Mecca  And I'm watching this  In my hotel room  It's 3 o'clock in the morning  It's 24 hours  They have this  And there's this  This building  The square  Like  Looked like a shed  In the center  With like  It's very fancy  And everyone's  Milling around  This  This center  And they all have 
[03:28:00]  The same outfit on  This very traditional  White robe  And there's thousands  Of them  And they're all  Like one of those  Ant swarms  They're going in a circle  In a circle  And I'm looking at this  I'm like  If this was a new thing  If this was something  That someone had just  Invented in Ohio  And there was a new  Religion that just started  And they all had to  Go around this box  And circle it  People would be  Fucking tripping out  You're nuts  They would be freaking out  They'd be scary  It'd be dangerous  That's the amazing thing  About Scientology  Is we watched it grow  I guess not literally 
[03:28:30]  In our lifetimes  But pretty close  Pretty close  It didn't start  Much before we were born  And it's amazing  To be at the birth  Of that kind of thing  And then to imagine  How much more powerful  That stuff is  If you don't have  Mass media  I mean we have  We have video  Of Elvis Presley  We have film  Of Elvis Presley  We have audio recordings  And yet you hear people say  Elvis didn't do no drugs  I mean even in  Even in  With evidence 
[03:29:00]  That we trust  People can say  Elvis is alive  Elvis did this  Elvis did that  And Elvis was alive  During our lifetimes  And people can still  Make up shit  When nothing  In the scriptures  Was written  Until 300 years  After supposed  Jesus Christ  You've got to say  300 years  And they got  Everything right  Even though we can't  Get things accurate  On Kurt Cobain  We can write  We can write  Kurt Cobain  He wasn't really  That good  We can write that down 
[03:29:30]  And remember it  But it's just astonishing  So if it happened  Present day  I mean  We're seeing  The crazy shit  Of Scientology  And granted  Scientology is not  That successful  Both the people  Against it  And the people  For it  Pump up the numbers  But even having  Over four people  Believe in Scientology  You say not that successful  First of all  They're the second  Largest real estate  Holders in Los Angeles  Is that true?  They're trying to  Separate Hollywood  So that they can own Hollywood 
[03:30:00]  They have a tremendous  Amount of money  And influence  And you know  Anybody that's ever  Tried to criticize them  I mean  Wasn't there someone  Who was trying to  Write a movie  About them  A parody movie  And a guy got attacked  And they threw rocks  Through his fucking window  They act like a gang  I think they used to have  Some pretty hardcore lawyers  That would go after  Anybody that said  Anything bad about Scientology  It seems like  They calmed down  With that  With the litigation thing  They kind of have to  But that's a really  For PR purposes  That's a really good point  Joe  I mean  When you talk about 
[03:30:30]  Hollywood  I think there's  A huge influence  I'm not sure  And I may be wrong  About this  I'm not sure  If in mid America  They won't even let them  In Germany  Germany  Really  It's illegal  Yeah  Scientology  They're like  No  We know where this is going  We've seen something like this  We've seen the previews  Master race  Rockets from the sky  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  We've been here  Fuck that  Monsters from the sky  I mean 
[03:31:00]  Nothing is more  Futuristic or apocalyptic  Than the World War II scenario  Oh I know  It's amazing  A man who has  A vision of a master race  Genetic engineering  And rockets  Flying through the sky  It's slamming  And then  Not only that  But the most  Advanced technology  As far as like  Rocketry  And  Aviation  Yeah  You think Churchill  Is that bad?  That's crazy shit  It really is  It really is  How many  How many sci-fi movies 
[03:31:30]  Have just been based  On that whole idea  Is that  You know  Star Wars  If  Star Wars isn't  Fucking Nazis  The Empire  Isn't Nazis  I don't know what is  Yeah I watched  Inglourious Bastards  The other day  Well how about Nazis  Nazis  Oh you said  If that isn't Nazis  What is  I would say Nazis  Nazis  You know what  Put that way  That's a good point  I really did sound silly there  Do you ever want to show  Ancient Aliens  On the History Channel  I just got  I just got  Some Nazis  Ridiculously stupid show  For the most part 
[03:32:00]  But every now and then  They talk about  Some interesting shit  And they had  Aliens and the Third Reich  And it was all about  About the Nazis  How into the occult they were  And how into  Like you know  Like Tesla's work  And they were trying to  Come up with all this  You know  The crazy technological advantages  Over the enemy  Yeah  Yeah  They were doing some nutty shit  How they never got the bomb first  Is pretty amazing  Just a lot  Well because they were spending time  On the fucking occult stuff  On the occult stuff 
[03:32:30]  That's why  We were working on real shit  They were just explaining it to you  You say that  But if no one was working on the bomb  And that occult shit  If they kept working on it  And figured something out  Yeah  Well who the fuck knows  What they were up to  No  No  I'm not talking about  I'm not talking about  Non-science based  I'm saying  Maybe some of it  Had to do with science  You know  What they were doing  Was some pretty intense  And you know  They were looking like  Deep back into history  Hitler doing street magic  Take a card  They were looking at  The Bhagavad Gita  That's just a thumb tip sir 
[03:33:00]  With all due respect  Hitler  That's a thumb tip for you  It's really interesting  How fixated they were  On like ancient cultures  And you know  And then  The ancient knowledge  Yeah a lot of the symbolism  Was taken from it  Yeah well the whole  Roman Empire  The swastika itself  Swastika wasn't as good luck  But you know  If you want to build  An atomic bomb  And I know you do Joe  If you want to build  An atomic bomb  It's better to go with  New technology  Than old technology  Yeah this is true  The information on the  Nuclear bomb 
[03:33:30]  From 600 years ago  Not that good  Not that good  We'll get you there  That quickly  Very true  Unless  Societies existed  At a very high rate  Many times in the past  And been wiped out  Yeah  I stick with my original point  You think so?  I don't think there were  Advanced civilizations  I think we know pretty much  What's happened  For the past 50,000 years  Yeah  Well I don't think so  I think not only that  But more recently  They've been showing  That there is in fact  A lot of evidence  That there is advanced  Civilizations that were 
[03:34:00]  Wiped out  Have you ever studied  Any John Anthony West stuff?  No, not at all  Robert Schock is a geologist  At Boston University  And he's one of the main guys  That's working on  Trying to change the ideas  Of ancient Egypt  And one of the things he does  Is he's talking about  Water erosion on the Sphinx  The Sphinx is  You know this huge structure  And it's  Most people believe  It's built about  2,500 years ago  But what the problem is  The Sphinx enclosure  Has massive fissures  That were created  By thousands of years  Of rainfall  And the only time 
[03:34:30]  They had rainfall  The last time they had rainfall  In the Nile Valley  Was 9,000 BC  So what this guy is saying  Is that  Most of this stuff  There's stuff that's from  You know  2,500 BC  But there's also shit  That's probably from  Fucking way earlier  And there's different  Styles of construction  Very clearly different  Styles of construction  Zawi Hawass  Is the main guy  The head of  The Egypt studies  Over there in Egypt  He's the guy  The head of  He chooses  Who gets to  Study things  And where you get to dig 
[03:35:00]  And what you get to do  He's very resistant  To any ideas  Of predating  The ancient Egypt culture  But this is  Geology  Geologists look at this  And say  You are dealing with  Thousands of years  Of rainfall  To create these fissures  There's no doubt about that  This is very clear evidence  And the last time  There was that kind of rainfall  In the Nile Valley  Is 9,000 BC  But that still doesn't  Get you back  To an ancient civilization  That was as advanced  As ours  And it still doesn't  Get you back  More than 10,000 years  Well you're talking 
[03:35:30]  9,000 BC  Is more than 10,000 years  It's 11,000 years ago  And you're dealing  With someone  Who can make something  Incredibly complicated  You're talking about  Incredibly complicated  Massive stone structures  That were created  Back when they  Supposedly  Were just learning language  I mean language  Is only thought to be  30,000 to 40,000 years old  Now you're talking about  An advanced civilization  That still just built  Something out of rocks  Show me an airplane  What would be left  This is the big question  Landing gear  Fire  If there was something  Like a super volcano  And you know 
[03:36:00]  North America was wiped out  And then thousands of years later  You know  They come back here  15,000 years later  And they start digging  Through the rubble  What the fuck  Are they going to find  How many minutes  They're going to find  Stone  He'll be here  What are they going to find  Well they're going to find  That in 2011  There was a guy  On the radio  That couldn't add  Nine and two  That was stupid  Motherfucker  Should have probably  Shut up  He said 9,000 BC  I said nothing more  Than 10,000 years ago  I'm still embarrassed 
[03:36:30]  I don't think  There's anything left  I mean you look  At those pictures  Of Detroit  Flaming hot  Fucking nuclear piles  From their  Nuclear power plants  Have you looked at  Yeah how about an iPhone  One of them  One of them would make it  That would be gone  That thing would be  Eaten up by the earth  In a hundred years  There would be nothing left  No stone would be  That's the thing  About the Egyptian structures  So what big parts  Of the iPhone  Get the fuck out of here  This thing would be  Rotted away man  This thing would be gone  You would have a chip  In there  10,000 years later  Yeah  Really  I don't know about that 
[03:37:00]  I mean we were  Assuming that  I bet you  I bet you  If there was  An advanced civilization  I bet you five dollars  That it did  You're on Vegas boy  I know you Vegas fucks  Like to gamble  Now  All we've got to do  Is live 10,000 years  To pay this off  I mean if you see  What's going on  In Detroit  How the nature  Is reclaiming buildings  Quickly  Real quickly  Oh  In Russia  Yeah  There's been a lot  Of ancient  Like not even ancient  Excuse me  You know  50, 60 years  Buildings in Russia 
[03:37:30]  That are like  Eating up of trees  Trees are growing  Inside of them  Pusting through them  They look at  The surroundings of  Chernobyl and stuff  Yeah  That's what we're talking about  It looks pretty creepy  Trees just grow  Right through buildings  Crack through the concrete  Sure  10,000 years  We can't even wrap our heads  Around what the fuck that is  Yeah  10,000 years  There wouldn't be much left  I couldn't even add  Nine and two  I know  That was sad  There's a guy named  Graham Hancock  And he's got this  Fantastic book called  Fingerprints of the Gods  And it's all about  Ancient structures  That defy explanation  And most of them  Have alignments  That are 
[03:38:00]  They look exactly  Like constellations  And there's some sort  Of a connection  Between constructing  These things  And trying to recreate  What they see in the sky  And that this has  Occurred not just  At one part of the world  But many parts of the world  Suggesting that this was  Something that was done  On a massive scale  Many, many thousands  Of years before  We thought of  As human history  I mean  They've had to  Predate a lot of things  Very recently  There's a structure  They found in Turkey  This really complicated  Stone structures  That were like  12,000 
[03:38:30]  13,000 years old  And you saw the thing  They found in Spain  They believe they found  What might be Atlantis  And this is like  Real legit geologists  And archaeologists  Are saying this  But why just stone  Like and then you're saying  What's going to be around  In 10,000 years  How about the stone stuff  We made  Yeah  So will that be around  That will probably be around  The lions in front of the  Cornerstones and shit  In front of the library  Something like that  You know  Maybe  I mean but  Not much else  But what you might be seeing 
[03:39:00]  Is you might be seeing  Remnants of how powerful  Slave labor is too  That's true  The problem with that  Is they don't even believe  Slaves built the pyramids  I know that  I know that  I know that  That stuff's out there  But I'm just saying  You don't know that  The older stuff  Couldn't have been that  I mean when people are  When you have human life  Being cheaper  There's certain shit  You can do really well  Like carry rocks  Yeah but the numbers  Are so huge  I mean some of those  Monoliths that they  Found that haven't been  Moved yet  That are hundreds of tons  And perfectly cut  And fucking enormous 
[03:39:30]  There's a lot of evidence  That leads to  They had plenty of time  On their hands  They really did  I don't think that's enough  They had 10,000 years  They also had to eat  And they're running around  Chasing squirrels and shit  Trying to hit them with rocks  To feed themselves  I mean if you talk about  12,000 years ago  You're saying  The most advanced civilization  Are chasing squirrels  With rocks  Well we're talking about  What we're talking about  Our vision  That's his point  Our vision of 12,000 years ago  As opposed to what  May or may not have happened  If we look back  I mean we think  10,000 years ago 
[03:40:00]  We were basically  Throwing spears  At woolly mammoths  You know  That's our idea  Wait you went  From a squirrel  To a woolly mammoth  And from a rock  To a  You just went  8,000 years  Squirrels were very big  I'm big at  Flipping back and forth  Between animals  From squirrel  To woolly mammoth  That's in your new book  Isn't it  Yes  That's the title  Of my new paper  From squirrels  To woolly mammoth  From rock to spear  The Joe Rogan story  Shit we ate  While we made buildings  Gotta dumb it down 
[03:40:30]  It's a fascinating thing to me  Because when you look  At what's going on  With this giant earthquake  In Japan  And you know  And you see all these  Different cataclysmic disasters  That happen  And then you  Look at the fucking  Yellowstone one  It's the one that  Freaks me out the most  The super volcano  In Yellowstone  Is a caldera  That's fucking  300 kilometers wide  300 kilometers wide  It's a volcano  That's so big  That when it explodes  It doesn't have a peak anymore  It just leaves this big crater  And kills like 90%  Of the continent 
[03:41:00]  It's a continent killer  And it happens  Every six to eight hundred  Thousand years  Yeah  You got time right  I think we'll make it  600,000 years ago  I think we'll make it  Yeah they have thousands  Of earthquakes there  Every year  Thousands  Thousands of earthquakes  God  They have no idea  What's going to happen  Whether or not  But if it does blow  There's nothing left  There's literally nothing left  And that's happened  Many times  We've got to do something  About this  There's nothing you can  Enjoy yourself  We don't need it  We just don't need it  Somewhere out there  In space  Is a five mile wide 
[03:41:30]  Piece of iron  That's going 45,000 miles an hour  When it hits  Within the first second and a half  It will be five miles deep  Into the earth  Within the first second and a half  And it doesn't matter  It's a reset button  And we're fucked  Reset  Yeah  There's nothing you can do  To stop that  It's just another  Fucking Gulf of Mexico  Somewhere  The Yucatan  The Yucatan Peninsula  Anything bigger than a  Fucking rat  It's done  And the rats  Got to then  Evolve into something else  How does that happen  In 65 million years  The whole thing was done  Everything was done 
[03:42:00]  Except for little tiny animals  And then it became  This  Elephants  Birds  Giraffes  From squirrels  To will and minutes  From squirrels  To will and minutes  The paper  You've got to bring that around  It's amazing when you really  Think about that  That that happened  In 65 million years  But 65 million years  Is a long time  And that was kind of  The point you were making before  It's a really long time  I find it amazing  How long the dinosaurs  Were on earth  As opposed to how long  We are  So does my four year old son  Yeah see  Dinosaurs  They're fascinating 
[03:42:30]  I love it  Little toys at home  Little dinosaurs  Fascinating is fucking crocodiles  Dinosaurs that are still here  Still here  Yeah  If there wasn't a crocodile  And you saw a movie  With a crocodile in it  You'd be going  Could you imagine  If that thing was real  Well that's true  That's like a monster  They don't have to  Fucking breathe  Under water  Yeah that's true  For almost everything  I mean spiders  Yeah  Yeah yeah  A praying mantis  That's true  If you read about a praying mantis  Then you see that motherfucker  Have you heard of  The Brazilian wandering spider 
[03:43:00]  You want to talk about  A motherfucker of a spider  The most toxic spider  Known to man  This spider has killed  More people than any other spider  And this is how it kills you  There was one particular spider  Yeah the Brazilian wandering spider  Just one spider  Serial killer spider  Serial killer spider  This is how it kills you  With incredibly painful  Unending erections  What?  What?  The toxin from this spider  From Brazil?  Causes nitric oxygen  Yeah from Brazil  Of course  More crazy shit from Brazil  You first Joe  Yeah  You first  And by the way 
[03:43:30]  They're actually using it  As a cure  They're trying to use it  As a cure for erectile dysfunction  Because it creates nitric oxide  A massive supply of it  Where your dick  If you've survived this  Your dick's broken  Because it's basically  You redline your dick  It's like  And it just  Boom  Blows pistons  Through the fucking  Through the manifold  And it's done  I mean  It kills people  But the people  That it doesn't kill  Your dick is done  Forever  It wrecks your sexual life  You're no more  No more hard on  This comes from  Biting you anywhere 
[03:44:00]  Yeah  It doesn't have to  Bite you on the dick  That's right  You're right to the very tip  Of the dick  Yeah right on the tip  Of your dick  Well it causes  Very painful  Because guys try to fuck them  Massive pain  In all your muscles  Massive pain  Throughout your entire body  And the spider's  Just walking around  Out there  Yeah  Just walking  Well it's a wandering spider  Too  It doesn't have to  I'm just saying  Who's got a little stick  I mean  A stick with a bandana  With his goods tied on  It was really  Eight of them  I guess  It was really  It was really a set up  To my point  Why would you ever go  In the woods  Or hike in that area  That's terrible  Don't ever go anywhere 
[03:44:30]  Where money doesn't matter  Don't ever go anywhere  Where money doesn't matter  Words to live by  I went into the Everglades once  And when you haven't got  If you've got a thousand dollars  In your hand  And it won't help you  Doesn't matter  You don't want to be there  Right  You don't want to be there  Oh man  Don't ever go anywhere  Where money doesn't matter  The Everglades are so crazy  Because people  These fucking assholes  Go to pet stores  And buy vipers  And all these crazy 
[03:45:00]  Fucking snakes  And they go  I don't want this anymore  And they throw them  Into the swamp  And now they're  Eating crocodiles  Have you seen that shit  Have you seen that picture  There's a fucking photo  Of an alligator  That's half eaten  By a python  I don't believe  That picture's real  Really  I think there was  Something on Snopes  About it  But I might be  I might be missing  We'll have to look into that  But I know  Well first of all  There's a show  Where they go after them  And kill them  But there's dangerous shit  In the Everglades  Don't get me wrong  I'm not going on  They're not indigenous  They're alien species  I might argue  I might argue with you 
[03:45:30]  About exactly when  Civilization started  But dangerous shit  In the Everglades  We are brothers  On that  There's no argument  I don't have any knowledge  About when civilization started  I'm re-quoting  Some people  I was lied to  By E.O. Wilson  Who's that?  You know  The entomologist  Who's the real expert  On all ants  E.O. Wilson  Is the biologist  At Harvard  And he cock  And he  Whenever I say Harvard  I follow it with cock  And when people say  Why'd you say cock  I say  Why'd you say Harvard 
[03:46:00]  It just  Reminds you  That every time  You hear the word Harvard  You should say cock  Because then it just  Reminds you  That that might not  Be as important  As they think  If they went to Harvard  E.O. Wilson  Said to me  We want to do a bit  On Letterman  Here's the bit  On Letterman  I was reading something  Of E.O. Wilson's  About pheromones  You're right  And that ants  Would follow the trails  So I thought  Here's a boss thing  We'll do  We'll go on Letterman  Okay  We'll treat his desk  With pheromones  In the shape  Of the three of clubs 
[03:46:30]  And then we will say  We have psychic ants  We'll have Letterman  Pick a card  We'll force the three of clubs  Letterman will show it  To the ants  We'll dump them out  On his desk  And over the course  Of the whole show  The ants will spell  Three of clubs  How boss will that be  So I call E.O. Wilson  And I go  Will this work  And he goes yes  I said what kind of ants  So we talked to  Several entomologists  And they're all talking  About different species  Of ants  And then someone says  They're in the Everglades  And I can't get  Entomologists  To give me these ants 
[03:47:00]  So I say to one  Of our crew guys  Fuck it  We're going to go  To the Everglades  Find these ants  So I go with a guidebook  And I rent a car  And the one thing  He tells me is  Because he's got  Such a good sense of humor  Is he says  When you go in there  In order to find these ants  And dig them up  And use them  You can't use  Any insect repellent  So no deep  No nothing  So I go into the Everglades  Sweating like a motherfucker  In a t-shirt and shorts  With a shovel 
[03:47:30]  And a guidebook  To try to find ants  That I can put on Letterman  And as I walk  Into the Everglades  Fuck the crocodiles  I get attacked  By every species  Of insect  As God is my witness  Swear to God  There were at least  Twelve wandering spiders  Right on my dick  It was just horrible  And a nightmare  And I was in the Everglades  With my shovel  And my guidebook  To our crew guy  Robbie  Crying  Saying  Never go anywhere 
[03:48:00]  That money doesn't matter  Never go anywhere  Money doesn't matter  You want to hear  A crazy ants statistic  And it didn't work  It didn't work  Yeah I know  The biomass of ants  Is more than all  The rest of life on earth  Are you going to give me that one  No I wasn't going to say that  I was going to say  It's the same  The same weight as humans  The amount of ants  No no no no  All animals  Really I don't know about that  Because I read it recently  I read it recently  A lot of fucking ants  I read it recently  But it was probably  E.O. Wilson that said it  So he's a lying sack of shit  He sent me to the Everglades  The most dangerous thing in Africa 
[03:48:30]  They eat more things than anything  They eat elephants  They climb into the elephant's ear  And just start eating  Their fucking brain  While the elephant's walking around  Jesus  Let me answer a motherfucker dude  For humans  For humans  It's mosquitoes  Mosquitoes are the most  Because of malaria  Because of malaria  And because of us banning DDT  In the most racist move  Ever done in history  Banning DDT is racist?  Yeah  It was essentially saying  Americans saying  I thought it was banning B-E-T  We've  I always get that confused  No we've conquered malaria 
[03:49:00]  In the United States  It's a different kind of bug  So Silent Spring comes out  And we ban DDT worldwide  And sentence probably  500 million people to death  That could be  Wow  The banning the DDT  Was because of what reason?  It was really a racist reason?  No no  Mostly a book called Silent Spring  By Rachel Carson  And about the eagle  The ZPG person?  Eagle legs  Oh eagle legs  Getting all soft  And probably not  That's right  The American eagle 
[03:49:30]  But if those people  Were dying of malaria  In the USA  I contend  That we would not  Have banned DDT  It's the fact  That there was people  In mostly Africa  And India  That we decided  To ban it worldwide  Which we kind of did  In India  They still use it some  But DDT  Is a wonder drug  DDT is like  The polio vaccine  For malaria  And we let it  We took it off  The market  And  DDT is a pesticide  Right?  Yes exactly  But it really does  Take down mosquitoes  What is the bad part? 
[03:50:00]  There must be something  There's a lot of bad  But not as much bad  As children dying of malaria  It's always a trade off  Wow yeah  I'm a big DDT fan  I never would have  We see that  I never would have  Had you as a DDT fan  Tell you the truth  He's a fan of DDT  I wear the hat  And I cheer  And I paint my face  Like DDT  What do they say  Is wrong with DDT?  I'm ignorant about it  There's a book called  Silent Spring  That said that it was  Going to go into  Our food chain 
[03:50:30]  And do all sorts  Of damage  All the way up  Robin eggs were thinner  Eagle eggs were thinner  The shells of them  And there was  All sorts of damage  Whether that stuff  Is true  It certainly wasn't  As true as they said  Certainly you don't  Get anything good  Without trade offs  There is some bad  About DDT  But 500 million people  You've got to have  A pant load of bad  To let those people die  Yeah yeah  Were that many people  Going to die  From using it?  Probably not  Exactly that's the point  But you know  It's very easy  To be an environmentalist  Hardcore environmentalist 
[03:51:00]  When you are rich  And white  And living in the USA  You know  When you're not  Battling  Brazilian wandering  Spiders  Crawling up your asshole  Biting your dick  Yes  It's amazing  How quickly  The rainforest  Is going away too  You ever watch  Like go to a website  That shows you  How much of the rainforest  We're losing every day  It's terrifying  I haven't noticed  From my house  I just sit there  I watch TV  Cup of coffee  Yeah same pine trees  Out back  I don't care  The rainforest  Is disappearing  At an incredible rate  And with the rainforest 
[03:51:30]  A lot of wandering spiders  Spiders  A lot of other shit too  The fungus  They're finding  All these zombie funguses  Have you seen  All these different  Oh yeah  I just saw that zombie fungus  That was going right through  At one of those  Ant's head  Ant's heads  And controls the ants  And rewires their brains  Past fuck  The great  The article that I was reading  Quite a while ago  About the rewiring  Of the ant's brain  Had this great sentence  In it that said  The fungus  Makes the ant  Do things  No sane ant would do 
[03:52:00]  That is brilliant  That our language  Is so great  It can have the sentence  Do things  That no sane  Ant would do  Hey Bob's climbing up  On the top of the  The sheep  Is going to eat him  That crazy motherfucker  There's some sort of  Thing in his brain  Get him down  Get him down  We're all reasonable ants  Aren't we  He's doing things  No sane ant would do  Look at Bob  I know all ants  Are female  Fuck you  But you could still  Be named Bob  Right  Yeah  Okay  Just give me that 
[03:52:30]  There's men named Shirley  Shirley  Bobby  Right  Bobby  Bobby  Bobby  The female ant  Yeah  I find one of the most  Amazing things is that  It's Friday  It's about a quarter to eleven  And I'm still here  Only you guys would make us  Only you guys  We would stay late for  I'll tell you  What time do you guys usually leave  Ten o'clock  Ten  Really  Yeah but you guys are way too good  To pass up on  It's too much fun  What are you kidding  Well you're talking about  What sane ants will do  And seeing a guy's asshole  Yes  That's a good move  That is true  In the rainforest  Yeah  Did you hear about that guy  That walked the entire length  Of the rainforest 
[03:53:00]  The entire length of the Amazon  Took him eight hundred days  How about this guy  That's going to run  From pole to pole  They're calling him  The Forrest Gump of Australia  I think his name is  Farmer or something  He's a guy from Australia  And he's training  By running twenty six miles a day  A marathon every day  He's going to run  Fifty miles a day  From pole to pole  I know there are problems  With running  Yeah there are some kind of  But he's planning on doing that  And what I loved about this  Being a fat guy  It's important to care about this 
[03:53:30]  He has to take in  Six thousand calories a day  So he has to  Maybe it's twelve thousand  Twelve thousand calories a day  So he has to drink  Olive oil  To get enough calories  And I'm watching this  And going  Boy  I hate the idea of running  But that drink of the olive oil  Guys who climb Everest  Have to eat sticks of butter  Really  You just can't get enough calories  Into you  You're burning so many  So if you're running  Fifty miles a day  One of your big problems 
[03:54:00]  Is getting enough calories  And the way to solve that  Is by drinking olive oil  Which is very sexy  Oh man  That's got to make  For some nasty dumps  Just to run from pole to pole  To say you did it  Who gives a fuck  I agree  What is that nonsense  I agree  I don't know  Fifty miles a day  Show the world  They'll shut up then  They'll leave me alone then  Once I run pole to pole  Yeah  Yeah  But how  Everything is  Everything is  There must be some crazy  Motivation from childhood  He's doing so much  Wedgies that just 
[03:54:30]  Will never get out of his mind  He's doing some sort of  It's some sort of charity thing  He's raising money for  I think something that's  Undeniably good  Like fighting cancer  Or something  But he's  You know  He's not doing it just to  He gets to the pole  And right when he gets there  A polar bear eats his asshole  Just comes running after him  Just starts tearing his asshole apart  Right when they have cameras on  12,000 calories a day  That's a lot of food  12,000 calories a day  Yeah  That's several pizzas  Iraq how do you get that  Oh 
[03:55:00]  Oh see  Because we make fun  Because he's a little chubby  Oh the chubbiness  Yeah  He's okay  He's looking for a comeback  Yeah yeah  He's searching  Believe me  He's just going to tell you  Eating butter  Yeah that's  That part of climbing Everest  I'm okay with  That sounds alright  As a matter of fact  The list of things  That I like about climbing Everest  Eating butter  Eating butter  It's on the top of the list  No that's the end of the list  Oh that's it  There's nothing else  Think of something else good  About climbing Everest  Seeing the bodies  Wiggling your toes every step  So they don't fall off  Freezing cold  Not good  Freezing cold  Not good  Not being able to breathe  Not good 
[03:55:30]  Falling to your death  Not good  What about seeing all the bodies  The hundreds of bodies  On the way up there  Not good  Or you put another positive  Not good  Negative  Okay negative  That's negative for me too  But I just didn't want us  To get into a little  But how old does a dead body  From the internet  It's positive  What's that  From the internet  It's positive  When you're there in person  It's like what am I doing  How old does a body  Have to be before  It's cool to look at  Like if there's some  Explorers from the 1800s  Yeah  And there's their encampment  And that's where they died  You look and go  Alright that's kind of cool  If it's someone last week 
[03:56:00]  You're like  Ah body  With the North Face jacket on  Fuck that  Too soon  Yes  Too soon  Too soon  Too soon to look at a dead body  Too soon to look at the dead body  I think it's once the shit smell goes away  You're okay  The first guy  To climb Everest  Rule of thumb  I like that  Rule of thumb  For all too soon  For all too soon  Any joke you want to make  Once the shit smell goes away  That's it  Go crazy  You're in  What did you guys think  What did you guys think  About Gilbert Godfrey  Getting in trouble  For tweeting all those  Yeah they got  Japanese things  You know I'm from  The school of thought 
[03:56:30]  As they say  Anything  I think anything  Should be able to be said  But  There are no  But there are consequences  There are no bad guys  In this  Aflac is a  Is an insurance company  Right  Being edgy  Is not an upside  For an insurance company  No  I'm very good friends  With Gilbert  And I talked to him  A lot about this  And  I didn't know  They were 75% Japanese  Amazing  Who knew  But when Gilbert  Made those jokes  And everybody forgets this  Gilbert was making those jokes 
[03:57:00]  Before he saw the future  You know  We didn't know  On that Friday  How terrible  It was going to get  Right  And there is a certain line there  So Aflac did exactly  The right thing  And so did Gilbert  You know  You have to say  When you are as brilliant  As Gilbert  It is your job  To society  To say anything  That pops into your head  Now  Without Twitter  That doesn't happen  Because without Twitter  He doesn't get to say it  Until a week later  When he already knows shit  But none of us  And I don't mean  In entertainment 
[03:57:30]  I mean in the world  Know how to use Twitter yet  So it's a  It's a nutty situation  That Joe just  While he was talking to us  Sent out to a million people  Something that I said  He could have made a mistake there  I was going to  But I forgot  What your exact quote was  Don't go anywhere  Where money doesn't matter  When we're done here  I'll do that  But I mean  So I think  I think you've got a situation  That's horrible  With no bad guys  It's once again  You don't see evil  It's not like the Aflac guy  Said  I want to stop all  Freedom of speech 
[03:58:00]  Fuck him  Right  He was like  Oh man  That's really bumming  Some of our customers  We got to stop it  Yeah  And you know  Gilbert  It's a good take  Gilbert did not say  I have no respect  For people who are suffering  In Japan  That isn't part of it  I mean as Joan Rivers said  And it's you know  She's exactly right on this  There are many many ways  Of dealing with grief  Entombing the reactor  Is a last resort  This is the next thing  They're talking about  When it comes to this  So there you go  Fucking so scary  10,000 years from now 
[03:58:30]  That's what will be left  Yes  A boiling  Nuclear core  But not really  That much more scary  Than the tsunami  And the earthquake  I mean the tsunami  And the earthquake  Will kill more people  Than the nuclear thing  Yeah  But the tsunami  And the earthquake  When they're done  They're done  Well no  They're not done  This fucking thing  Is halfway for 20,000 years  This shit  They're not done  They're done  They're moving the whole continent  Inches  Noticeable amounts  They're not done  They're done  There's bad shit  That happens everywhere  I'm definitely not  Doubting that 
[03:59:00]  But I'm saying  That this is a scary thing  This not being able  To shut down  Nuclear power plants  Yeah  This scares the fuck  Out of me man  I was wondering  About Japan moving  How far did they say  It moves  Eight feet  Eight feet  Eight feet  Was it that  Is that gonna fuck  GPS up  Where it's gonna tell you  To turn eight feet  Before you're supposed to  But look at the bright side  You're not gonna be  Driving in Japan for a while  No  No  Absolutely not  You don't have to worry about  Just get a driver  While you're there  The satellites have no clue  That anything moves 
[03:59:30]  They just have a grid  But there's a gap  In the ocean floor  That's 50 miles wide  And 270 miles long  Where the epicenter was  And is that where Godzilla is  Yeah  That's what's gonna come  Out of there man  Because I mean  If we were ever  Gonna get Godzilla  This is the time  Yeah this is the time  It's got nuclear stuff  I think we've shown  That Godzilla's total bullshit  What is this U.S. evacuation region  What the fuck is that  That's where no American soldiers  Or citizens are allowed to go in  Our zone's a little bigger  Than the Japanese one 
[04:00:00]  They're like  Nah  We're not believing their zone  Yeah we're not  We're not buying that zone  But I don't think  Don't worry  We're not evacuating San Francisco  That's the weird thing  When you see online  These cloud fucking scenarios  Oh they were showing  Kind of  Yeah where radiation would go  Picked up on the jet stream  And dumped on  Northern  The North Pacific  Yeah  Yeah that's  That's not good  That's a little odd  That's a little  But I think it's supposed to be  Just a minuscule amount  Just a little radio activity  Well there's a lot of people 
[04:00:30]  That believe every time  You go through the x-ray thing  The new thing  At the airport  It's fucking up your DNA  Yeah but I think  Those are people  That are politically motivated  Possibly  They said in Hong Kong  Right now  Which is however many miles away  You're getting the exact  Radiation of one one hundredth  Of an x-ray  Oh see  That's not bad  We could take that  Yeah  Did you  You had a thing  At the TSA recently  I was reading about that  It wasn't recently  It just showed up  It was in 2002  Really?  That I was  I was against TSA  Before it was cool  A guy 
[04:01:00]  A guy  Was grabbing my  What did the guy say?  A guy was grabbing my cock  Filling me up  No no  It was junk for that guy  But for me  The  What you always do  At TSA  What I believe  Is if anything goes wrong  You ask for real police  Uh huh  Because real police  Hate leather sniffers  They hate guys  Playing police  Right  Whenever you have a confrontation  With a mall cop  You know  A fake cop  If you get a real cop 
[04:01:30]  In there  The dynamics always go  To your side  Unless you know  You're doing something  Really egregious  And so I went through  And this guy  Just said  Hey don't do that  And he started  Giving me some attitude  And I said  Call the police  And he said  No we don't need  To call the police  You've done nothing wrong  I said no I haven't  You have  Call the police  And he said  No no  I don't have to call  I said no no  That's my right  As a citizen  Get metro in here  It was in Vegas  And then the real police officer  Says  You were grabbing his dick  But I said 
[04:02:00]  You know  I don't care  Really  Anyone can grab my dick  You just have to ask me beforehand  I require dinner  Anything  Right right  I'm not homophobic  I don't care  Grab my cock  Just let me know  You're going to do it  But I also care a lot  About the constitution  A lot about freedom  So it's a weird combination  I don't need to protect  You just put out  A very strange invitation  I don't need to protect  I don't need to protect  My cock  But I'd like to  For the sake of my country  Right  So my cock  Is a patriotic area  It's not  I don't  You know  I'm not afraid of anything  So do you think 
[04:02:30]  He was grabbing your dick  Just to humiliate you  No no no  Yeah yeah  It was just to  Because I showed  A little attitude  Imagine me showing  A little attitude  Oh no  He must have misinterpreted something  It must have been just  I had a belch or something  I had the look on my face  Look like  I was contemptible to him  And in 2002  If you questioned anything  You were unpatriotic  That was the height of fever  Oh my god  You know what they did though  You know what the final thing  They did was  Is after I did this little  And I tried to do it  Very politely  And through proper channels  And stuff  Through the police officer  The TSA person in Vegas  Called up and said 
[04:03:00]  You know Penn  We don't want to have  Any trouble with this  When you're going to fly somewhere  You just let us know  And we'll get you through  Without going through the security  I'll see  And I went  No no  I don't want special treatment  It wasn't about me  It was about the idea of it  As a matter of fact  You're much more welcome  To feel me up  Than the elderly ladies  And the children  Who you're frightening to death  I don't give a fuck  That is the worst  When you see old ladies  Getting stripped  They get filled up  And their arms stretched out 
[04:03:30]  Like come on  This lady's shaking  She can't even hold her arms out  Hunchbacked  She doesn't know what it means  It's just horrible  But that's what they do  And the reason  I didn't  You know  The police officer said  You know  I saw this  He was acting wrong  You can go with a lawsuit  Is I felt it would come across  As this fucking Vegas magician  Thinks he's special  Doesn't want people touching him  Right  Sure  So I didn't want to come off  Like that's not the point  But I want to say  I want to add to this  That I've never taken  That special treatment  I turned them down  Yeah  Because it just seems 
[04:04:00]  So fucking wrong  It's like  Oh  You can go on TV  You can complain about this  Let's take you through  The special line  Now I also don't know  If that offer is available anymore  I don't want people  Going crazy and saying  There's a special line  People want to get checked  I don't even know  If it existed  She could have been  Bluffing all of it  I never found out  You should go through it  With layers and layers  Of clothes on  Sweating like a pig  Looking  But I mean  It's  It's  It's security theater  And I think everybody  Everybody knows  It really is  It's there to kind of 
[04:04:30]  Make you feel like  They're doing something  But things slip through  All the time  Yeah  Didn't they just have  A thing in the post  It was the daily news  In the post  They showed knives  And shit  They just snuck through  Guy brought a box cutter  On the plane  And I think  Because it was for his job  Or something  And he had it in there  And he's the one  That said  Like look  I didn't mean to have this  And they freak out  Then  Oh well come on out  You gotta come out  It's like  He was fessing up  To the fact that  He had it on him  Well you know  We also have the point  That they put pilots 
[04:05:00]  Through that shit  The pilots go through  Yeah yeah  And the pilots  You know  They have a way to do it  Once you're the pilot  Of the fucking plane  You don't have to worry  About nail clippers  You really don't  Yeah  Do you remember  That guy in Egypt  The pilot  That fucking took  The plane down  Oh man  It crashed the plane  Yeah  He's screaming  A la Akbar  Yeah  Yeah  He crashed the plane  What did he  He laid a hammer  Over the co-pilot's  Head or something  And just decided  That's it  This is it  I'm going in  Time to wrap it up  The problem is  Once you're going to  Kill everybody 
[04:05:30]  Including yourself  In the plane  Hitting a guy  In the head  With a hammer  Not that bad  It really not that bad  I mean  If you're looking  At what you're going to do  You're committed  On the way to that  You know  That's okay  Unless it's  Once you bring him  Though that's a commitment  You don't want to  Change your mind  After that  You can't say  Worse than saying  No in improv  There's an amazing story  Of a freight line  It was FedEx  Or UPS  One of the airplanes  Using an old  One of those L-1011s  And a guy  Wanted to  Kill himself  Get the insurance money 
[04:06:00]  For his family  One of these old gags  So he flies on the jump seat  Has a hammer on him  And goes into the  Flight deck  And just starts beating  The shit out of the pilot  And co-pilot  And one of the guys  Got up  And they were  Major League  Fucked up in the head  Like bleeding  On their brains  And grabbed this guy  And as they're fighting  The guy pulls out a knife  He's stabbing one guy  And the pilot  Who's also semi-conscious  Just starts rolling  The plane over  And now the co-pilot  And the hijacker 
[04:06:30]  At this point  He's now a hijacker  Are flopping from the ceiling  To the floor of the plane  He's trying to knock  This guy out  Using acrobatics  With the plane  Holy shit  Finally got him  To the point  Where the co-pilot  Was able to  Hold him down  And they landed the plane  They both wound up  With really horrible  Head injuries  And everything  But landed the fucking plane  And thwarted  The guy's attempts  To crash the plane  An amazing story  I saw it on one of those  Minutes before disaster 
[04:07:00]  Shows  Wow  That's crazy  Unbelievable  How many people  In the fucking main cabin  Got fucked up  Landing on their head  It was a freight  It was a freight  It was a freight thing  And some of the freight  Was coming out  And smashing these guys  And the way the story  Was told  Was just like  Oh my god  That's horrific  The way the story  Was told  Was like  They had to fill  Cable television hours  Yes  Exactly  And I was  Right there  Watching  Recreation  I love a good recreation  I know that way  That we have
